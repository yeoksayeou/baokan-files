    "content": "Circular of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Commemorating \"July 1st\" and \"July 7th\"\n    This year's July 1st is the 27th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and July 7th is the 11th anniversary of the national war of resistance against Japanese imperialist aggression. The following are the regulations for the entire Party to commemorate these two anniversaries:\n    (1) On July 1st, Party committees at all levels should convene meetings of Party cadres, general meetings of Party members, or commemorative meetings of activists. At this meeting, a brief report should be given on the 27-year history of the Party, explaining that the Communist Party of China, through its struggles in the period of the Great Revolution, the period of the Ten-Year Civil War, the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and this People's Liberation War, has developed from a small group of dozens of people into a fully mass-based party of over three million people. It has won the support of the broad masses of the people and is uniting workers, farmers, independent laborers, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese across the country, consolidating the anti-Chiang national united front, carrying out the victorious People's Liberation War, and striving for the national victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. The entire Party should be told: This historical development proves that the New Democratic Revolution advocated and implemented by the Communist Party of China, that is, the revolution led by the proletariat, of the masses of the people, and against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, is completely correct; it proves that the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms over this revolution is completely correct. The task of the entire Party today is to resolutely, correctly, and unreservedly implement all the lines and policies of our Party Central Committee, overcome all tendencies to deviate from the central line and policies, and tendencies of indiscipline, in order to achieve the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution as quickly as possible. To this end, Party committees at all levels should, in the coming period, use available time to focus on organizing Party cadres to study the central line and policies, especially various important documents published by the Party Central Committee and central comrades in recent times, and, in light of the actual conditions and specific work of various localities and departments, launch discussions to raise awareness and improve work.\n    (2) On July 7th, Party committees at all levels should propose to the government and people's organizations to hold mass commemorations in appropriate forms and on an appropriate scale. In this commemoration, Communists should tell the people: how Japanese imperialism once invaded China; how the Chinese people united to resist and achieve victory; how American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek usurped the fruits of the Chinese people's victory and plunged the Chinese people into an unprecedented civil war; how American imperialism is actively invading China and supporting the revival of Japanese imperialism; and how the traitor Chiang Kai-shek is selling out China's national interests to American imperialism and Japanese imperialism. The people should be told that the main methods to restore China's national interests and resist the aggression of American and Japanese imperialism are to develop the national united front and the people's liberation struggle, overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous regime, and establish a democratic coalition government; only in this way can the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation be guaranteed, and truly equal relations be established with all foreign countries.\n    (3) Other methods of commemorating these two anniversaries may be decided by various localities according to specific circumstances. When conditions are appropriate and required by the masses, the two commemorations may also be held jointly.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　June 28, 1948 (with picture)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中国共产党中央宣传部关于纪念“七一”和“七七”的通知\n\n1948-07-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中国共产党中央宣传部关于纪念“七一”和“七七”的通知\n    今年的七月一日是中国共产党成立的二十七周年纪念日，七月七日是中国民族反抗日本帝国主义侵略的爱国战争十一周年纪念日。兹规定全党对于这两个纪念日的纪念办法如下：\n    （一）在七月一日，各级党委应该召集党的干部会议或党员大会或活动分子的纪念会。在这个会上，应该简要地报告党的二十七年的历史，说明中国共产党经过大革命时期、十年内战时期、抗日战争时期、和这一次人民解放战争中的奋斗，已经由几十个人的小组发展为现在业已超过三百万人的完全群众化的大党，得到了广大人民的拥护，并正在团结着全国的工人、农民、独立劳动者、知识分子、自由资产阶级、开明绅士、少数民族和海外华侨，巩固反蒋的民族统一战线，进行胜利的人民解放战争，争取中国人民民主革命的全国胜利。应该告诉全党：这个历史的发展，证明中国共产党所主张和实行的新民主主义革命，即无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的革命，是完全正确的；证明毛泽东同志及其战友们对于这个革命的领导，是完全正确的；全党今天的任务，就是坚决地、正确地、毫无保留地执行我党中央的全部路线和政策，克服一切离开中央路线政策的倾向和无纪律的倾向，以便尽可能迅速地达到中国人民民主革命的胜利。为此目的，各级党委应该在今后一个时期内，利用可能的时间，着重地组织党内干部对于中央的路线、政策的学习，特别是学习最近时期内党中央和中央同志所发表的各种重要文件，联系各地方各部门的实际情况和具体工作，展开讨论，提高觉悟，改进工作。\n    （二）在七月七日，各级党委应该向政府和人民团体提议，举行适当形式和适当范围的群众纪念。在这个纪念中，共产党员应该告诉人民：日本帝国主义曾经怎样侵略中国；中国人民怎样团结抵抗并取得胜利；美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石怎样窃取中国人民的胜利果实，并把中国人民投入空前的内战；美帝国主义怎样积极侵略中国，并扶植日本帝国主义复活；以及卖国贼蒋介石怎样向美帝国主义和日本帝国主义出卖中国的民族利益。应该告诉人民：恢复中国民族利益，抵抗美日两帝国主义侵略的主要方法，就是发展民族统一战线和人民解放战斗，推翻蒋介石的卖国政权，成立民主联合政府；只有这样，才能保障中国民族的独立自由，并与一切外国建立真正平等的关系。\n    （三）纪念这两个纪念日的其他方法，可由各地按照具体情况，自行决定。在条件适当并为群众所要求的时候，也可以将两个纪念合并举行。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　中国共产党中央宣传部\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四八年六月二十八日（附图片）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th\n\n　　When the reporter entered the delegation's dormitory, he first met the famous labor hero Zhao Zhankui. He is now over fifty years old, but still as determined and strong as ever. In the liberated areas within the passes, his model deeds are known to all workers. Now he is the chairman of the trade union of a state-owned factory. After the Jiang bandit claws reached Yan'an last March, he and the entire staff transferred their factory several times, insisting on working in extremely difficult war conditions. Sometimes some workers armed themselves to cover other workers to carry out their work, and they were still able to exceed the original production tasks. When talking about the experience of coming to Harbin this time, he said excitedly: \"Our world has grown big! The people's world has grown big! This time we traveled tens of thousands of miles, all in our liberated areas, and everywhere there were people welcoming us. Especially seeing the vast industrial construction and the strong and organized worker brothers in the Northeast Liberated Area, I am really extremely happy! This is the great victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao!\"\n    Secondly, the reporter met Zhang Qiufeng. He is a foundry worker who was in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and is a well-known special-class labor hero in Jin-Sui. Whether in the past or now, he has been able to unite the workers well and overcome all difficulties in material conditions to carry out production. When he mentioned the arduous struggle of the workers and environment in the Northwest, he said: \"The workers in the Northwest are not only working hard to produce and support the war, but also constantly fighting against the荒旱 [huang han - drought]. This year, the workers have generally used their spare time to reclaim wasteland for farming. The factory where I am alone has planted eighty 垧 [qing - about 666 square meters] of land.\" When he talked about the rapid recovery of industry and the rapid development of new construction in the Northeast, and the continuous increase in workers' enthusiasm for production, he showed an indescribable excitement and joy, and from time to time revealed the smile of a victor, saying: \"This is the result of Chairman Mao's leadership and the efforts of the laboring brothers.\"\n    Yang Wanhong and Geng Xilin, labor representatives from Jin-Cha-Ji, said when talking about their impressions of entering the Northeast Liberated Area: \"As soon as we entered the Northeast Liberated Area, we felt that the workers in the Northeast were organized, and all factories and railways seemed to be organized, planned, and orderly. For example, the train we took departed and arrived on time, not a minute late. Trade union organizations are very common, and staff and intellectuals also participate in trade unions. The workers are very enthusiastic about learning. They have well-written wall newspapers, perfect workers' clubs, and regular production exhibitions. Every activity shows the continuous progress of the workers in technology and politics. In the factory, we can see workers working hard everywhere. In a factory in a certain place, we saw a No. 2 machine whirring. A worker told us: \"The Americans thought it couldn't be repaired, but after passing through our hands, it's running now.\" The improvement of the political consciousness of the workers in the Northeast is also reflected in the merit-making campaign and the model worker campaign. Everyone has formulated a strict plan for increasing production and making meritorious deeds, and everyone expresses extreme respect for labor heroes, which moves us very much. In a certain place, when the workers heard that Zhao Zhankui had arrived, they all surrounded him, and teenage female workers came forward to shake his hand. Everywhere we go, many worker brothers come to warmly welcome us, waving and cheering, fully demonstrating the friendship and unity of the working class.\"\n    Zhang Fulin, the 48-year-old head of the East China Workers' Delegation, is a miner from Zaozhuang for more than 20 years, and is now the deputy director of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the director of the Lunan Federation of Trade Unions. With a tall stature and a dark face, he is a typical Shandong hero. He talked to reporters about the heroic deeds of the workers in the area during the long and cruel struggle in Zaozhuang in which the enemy and us entered and exited three times, from dismantling railways, destroying layers of power grids, and leading the way for our army, to organizing a workers' picket team of ×××× people to suppress special agents, protect mines, and cooperate with the main force to pursue and suppress bandit puppet Wang Jimei, and so on. Xie Haorong, a representative from Central China, in recalling the glorious achievements of General Su Yu's troops in winning seven battles and seven victories, described the heroic deeds of the Rugao Workers' Picket Team in bravely defending the people of Rugao after the main force withdrew. When the topic turned to the impressions of the Northeast Liberated Area, the representatives from East China all praised the rapid development of industry in the Northeast Liberated Area. For example, when the army entered a textile factory in a certain place, there were only 15,000 broken spindles. Three months later, not only were they all repaired, but the number was increased to 20,000 spindles. The representatives unanimously expressed their admiration for the railway employees' hundredfold efforts to repair railway bridges and their working spirit of not even taking a holiday during the Lunar New Year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民的天下大了　访问关内职工代表团\n\n1948-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　人民的天下大了\n    访问关内职工代表团\n    记者走进代表团宿舍的时候，首先会见了著名的劳动英雄赵占魁。他现在已经五十多岁了，但是还是那样的坚毅和强壮。在关内解放区，他的模范事迹职工们是人人皆知的。现在他是一个公营工厂的工会主任。在去年三月蒋匪魔瓜伸入延安后，他和全体职工会将他们的工厂数度转移，在极端困难的战争环境下坚持工作，有时部分工友武装起来，掩护另一部分工友进行工作，仍然能超过原定的生产任务。在谈到这次来哈的经过，他兴奋的说：“咱们的天下大了！人民的天下大了！这次我们走了万把里路，全是咱解放区，到处都有欢迎咱们的人，尤其是看到东北解放区广大的工业建设和强大而有组织的工人兄弟队伍，真高兴极了！这就是毛主席领导下中国人民伟大的胜利啊！”\n    其次，记者会见了张秋凤。他是个翻砂工人，抗日战争时期就在晋绥解放区，是晋绥有名的特等劳动英雄。无论过去和现在，他都能很好的团结工人和克服一切物质条件的困难而进行生产。他在提到西北工人和环境作艰苦斗争时说：“西北工人一方面紧张生产支援战争，一方面还在和荒旱作不断的斗争。工友们在今年普遍的利用工余开荒种地，单是我所在的那个工厂就种了八十垧地。”当他谈到东北工业的迅速恢复和新建设的迅速开展，以及工人生产热情不断提高的时候，呈现着一种说不出的兴奋和愉快，不时的露出胜利者的微笑说：“这是毛主席的领导和劳动弟兄们努力的结果。”\n    晋察冀的代表劳动英雄杨万宏、耿希林等在谈进入东北解放区的印象时说：“一进入东北解放区，就感觉到东北的工友是组织起来了，一切工厂和铁路都显得有组织，有计划，有秩序。比如我们坐的火车，准时开出，准时到达，一分也不差。工会组织很普遍，职员知识分子也都参加了工会。工友们学习情绪很高，他们有内容充实的壁报，完善的工人俱乐部，定时的生产品展览，每样活动都说明了工人在技术和政治上的不断进步，在工厂里，到处可以看到工人们在那儿起劲生产。我们在某地一个工厂里，看到一架二号机在哗哗的开动着，一个工友告诉我们：“这是美国人都认为修不好的，可是经过了我们的手，现在它动起来了。”东北工人政治觉悟的提高，还表现在立功运动和劳模运动上。每个人都订了严密的增产立功计划，每个人都对劳动英雄表示着极端的敬爱，这使我们很感动。在某地，工友们听说赵占魁来了，都围了上去，十几岁的小女工们都上前握手。我们每到一处，都有许多的工人弟兄们来热烈的欢迎我们，向我们招手欢呼，充分表现了工人阶级的友爱和团结。”\n    四十八岁的华东职工代表团团长张福林，是枣庄二十多年的矿工，现在是山东省工会的副主任兼鲁南工会主任。魁梧的身材，黝黑的面孔，真是典型的山东健儿。他跟记者畅谈了敌我在枣庄三进三出长期残酷斗争中该区工人的英勇事迹，从拆铁路，破坏层层电网，替我军带路，到组织拥有××××名的工人纠察队，镇压特务，保护矿井，配合主力追剿匪伪王继美等等。华中代表谢浩荣在追述粟裕将军部队七战七捷的光荣战绩中，描绘了如皋工人纠察队在主力撤离后英勇捍卫如皋人民的英勇事迹。当话题转到对东北解放区的观感时，华东的代表们都盛赞东北解放区工业的迅速开展。如某地纺织厂在军进驻时，只有一万五千破烂锭子，三个月后，不仅全部修复，且增加到两万个锭子。代表们对于铁路员工百倍努力的抢修铁路桥梁，连旧历年假都不休息的工作精神，一致表示钦佩。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社东北二十八日电】"

From the diary of Lai Ruxiong, Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang 76th Division, seized during the Northwest People's Liberation Army's liberation of Baoji, one can see that the enemy had no confidence in defending Baoji. On April 18th, Lai met with Liu, the Baoji Garrison Commander, who boasted to him, \"If the bandits attack, I will immediately lead my troops to the suburbs to join local armed forces and fight a guerrilla war.\" When the 29th Army was annihilated in Yichuan, Lai was training at the Central Training Corps in Nanjing. His diary reads: \"Army Commander Liu (Kan) led the 27th and 90th Divisions to reinforce Yichuan, and was annihilated by the Communist army on March 1st. The Army Commander and Division Commander Yan (Ming) died in battle, shocking the entire nation. On March 2nd, I went to the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about the truth. I couldn't sleep for two days, and I felt extremely fearful about the situation in the Northwest.\" On March 23rd, Hu Zongnan summoned him in Xi'an. The Yichuan battle was originally Hu Zongnan's responsibility, but Hu pushed it onto the dead Liu Kan. Lai's diary recorded Hu Zongnan's words: \"In the Qingjian battle, I (Hu referring to himself) told him (referring to Liu Kan) to take two divisions to relieve the siege, but he failed to attack fiercely and decisively, delaying for four hours, resulting in the 76th Division suffering losses. This time, he has already died in the Yichuan battle. I won't even mention that we didn't have any rewards or punishments for such a large war. After the Qingjian and Zhenchuanbao (referring to the Shajiadian battle) battles, I didn't even hold a review meeting. Why didn't I hold one? Because once I did, Army Commander Liu would have to take responsibility.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 从缴获赖汝雄日记看到　宝鸡守敌毫无信心\n\n1948-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　从缴获赖汝雄日记看到\n    宝鸡守敌毫无信心\n    【新华社西北廿九日电】西北解放军解放宝鸡之役，曾缴获蒋匪整七六师参谋长赖汝雄日记一册，从那个日记可以看到敌人对宝鸡防守毫无信心。四月十八日赖去见宝鸡警备司令刘某，刘对他吹牛说：“匪如来犯，当即率领所部到郊外联络地方武装去打游击。”整二十九军在宜川被歼时，赖正在南京中央训练团受训，日记中这样写着：“刘（戡）军长率二十七、九十两师增援宜川，三月一日被共军歼灭，军长及严（明）师长殉职，全国震动。余于三月二日往国防部询探真情，两日未曾入睡，对西北局面实觉惶恐之至也。”三月二十三日，胡宗南在西安召见他。宜川战役本来是胡宗南的责任，可是胡却推在死了的刘戡头上。赖日记中记胡宗南的话说：“清涧之役，我（胡自称）叫他（指刘戡）带两个师去解围，他不能猛烈果敢的攻击，迟了四个钟头，结果使七十六师吃了亏。这次宜川战役他已死了。我且不说这样大的战争我们一点奖罚都没有。当清涧、镇川堡（按指沙家店战役）两次战役后，我连检讨会都没有开。为什么不开呢？因为一开就要刘军长负责。”"

    "author": "Yu Dan, Liang Yu",
    "date": "1948-07-01",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Communist Party Member Xiang Tishui (from Shili Village), a labor hero in Huguan County, Taihang, has never relaxed in terms of thought, action, personal production, or village-wide production this year. Even during the most intense period of Party rectification and democracy, he persisted in production, publicized Party policies, helped the masses and other village cadres resolve confused ideas, and encouraged them to work hard in production. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, when county and district cadres went to meetings to study, Tishui estimated that the land reform movement would begin soon, but he did not wait passively. He immediately discussed with branch cadre Xiang Youshun: \"Let's cadres and Party members take the lead and deliver the manure quickly. Once the movement starts, we won't have time to deliver it, lest it delay planting.\" After speaking, he led his team to deliver manure to the fields, while mobilizing other teams to do the same. Many people did not understand the Land Law and were afraid of delivering manure for nothing, so they were unwilling to move forward. Tishui said: \"Everyone should quickly deliver manure to the fields they should. Manure cannot be divided equally; even if a very small number of fields are subject to adjustments, manure money and wages must be paid. In a few days, when the district cadres come back and start the movement, it will delay production, and everyone will suffer.” The masses agreed with his statement, and he led everyone in discussing and formulating a plan to deliver all the manure by the 13th day of the first lunar month. Then, he organized Party members and cadres to take the lead, and the whole village took action. A few middle peasants still had concerns, but they also followed everyone to deliver the manure. More than 40 households delivered manure at night with torches when the ground was frozen because the roads were muddy during the day. As a result, all kinds of manure, including sheep, donkey, and dregs, were delivered to the fields in nine days.\n\nAfter the county and district cadres returned from the meeting, the work team went to Shili Village to carry out land reform and Party rectification. At the beginning, only one branch meeting was held, and the Party members and cadres were kicked aside and ignored. However, Tishui did not collapse because of this. He said to village chief Xiang Huaixing: \"This time is different from usual. We should focus on mobilizing the poor peasants and farm laborers. Let's deliver the food to their homes for them (the work team). If we mobilize the masses, we can follow the mass line well in the future.\" In order to minimize the delay in production caused by Party rectification, Tishui arranged the production of his team in advance, with Xiang Laixing responsible for agriculture and Xiang Songkui and others responsible for sideline production (especially transportation). During the Party rectification, the team's agricultural and sideline production did not stop. The transportation team ran to Lin County nine times, earning 310,000 Jiao. His wife did not understand the significance of Party rectification and thought she would be criticized, saying: \"I'm afraid we won't be able to feed this mule well.\" Tishui said: \"Revolution is about making the people rich, not making us poor. How could this happen? Party rectification is for improvement.\" He persuaded her, and she wove ten bolts of cloth during the Party rectification period.\n\nTishui was not only responsible for his family and team's production but also cared about the entire village. When the Party rectification began, the cadres and masses of the Third Brigade stopped production, and the livestock had not moved for seven days. Tishui said to Ma You, who was in charge of production: \"You have nine carts and seven donkeys. If you calculate it by hauling coal, you can haul it three times in seven days. Just counting the nine carts, you will haul 8,000 jin less. If you calculate one jin at nine yuan, you will earn 72,000 yuan less. The livestock at home still need to be fed.\" The Third Brigade listened to him and resumed transportation. The Second Brigade saw that others were doing well and followed suit.\n\nWhen the village classified classes, the masses were very confused. It was also the time for planting, and more than 300 sheep were not trampling the manure in the sheepfold. Tishui said: \"The struggle is against feudal exploitation, not against us. I'm not afraid. If no one is trampling, I will.\" This stabilized everyone's minds. Xiao Qin, on the other hand, was a new middle peasant who was waiting to divide things. His family lacked manure, so he did not trample the manure in the sheepfold. Tishui said to him: \"No matter what, we have to plant. To plant, we have to apply manure. If it's a gully, applying manure will fill it up; if it's not a gully, it won't fill up without applying it. What are you waiting for? If you don't apply manure, you won't harvest grain, and you will starve yourself.\" Xiao Qin became sober and trampled manure for more than ten days. Some people were afraid of having their land taken away, so they were uneasy and had no intention of producing. Tishui combined the situation in his village to publicize the Party's policies, saying: \"There are not many households with less land or more land in our village. The amount of land taken or given will not be much. It will be one or two mu taken or given. Don't delay the majority because of the minority.\"\n\nDuring the Party rectification, some Party members and cadres were very afraid because they had made some mistakes. Some who had made big mistakes thought of committing suicide. Tishui said: \"Not to mention that we haven't committed a capital crime; even if my crime is so serious that I should die, I should let the Party execute me. It is beneficial to the Party to execute me. People will say that the Communist Party speaks the truth and does not want bad people. If you commit suicide, even if there was no problem originally, it will become a problem.\" He also said: \"If we make mistakes in our work, it's like accidentally hitting the seedlings with a hoe. Just be careful not to hit them in the future. It's wrong to stop moving because you are afraid of breaking the hoe.\" Therefore, he persisted in leading production during the Party rectification period. When the transportation team returned, he helped to calculate the accounts; when the transportation team left, he tried to buy it back for the next transportation. He also took time to work in the fields.\n\nHe himself naturally had mistakes and shortcomings in his work. For example, he had lost his temper with the masses (mostly for work), and sometimes his work methods were rigid and inflexible. During the Party rectification, some people exaggerated these shortcomings or made comments that did not match the facts when they were making comments on Party members. Even some comrades in the work team said: \"During the Party rectification, you were not at the hero meeting in Nanweiquan (1944) eating well, right?\" (Editor's note: Such sarcastic remarks to Party members are wrong and violate the Party rectification policy and should be corrected.) Tishui was very angry at the time and thought: \"At that time, the Party and the masses cultivated me. Today, they are here to educate me and let me correct my mistakes. Why do they say that?\" So he was determined to only do and not speak in the future, which was of course wrong. But after education, he quickly figured it out again. He said: \"It's not easy for the Party to cultivate us. If I have some experience and don't speak up, who will do the work?\" From his actions, he had carefully paid attention to his work style and attitude. For example, the mess hall of the Second Team reflected: \"Tishui's attitude has become better.\"\n\nIn terms of personal production, he worked as hard this year as he did in previous years. He applied more fertilizer than last year. He planted about twelve mu of autumn land. Last year, he applied 1,270 loads of manure, and this year he reached 1,450 loads, plus 400 loads of top dressing during the recent weeding, totaling more than 150 loads per mu. His example promoted the whole village to prepare 12,000 loads of top dressing. 2,400 loads have already been applied. Golden Queen and Tu Yujiao are ready to be weeded three times. After the land reform and Party rectification were over, Tishui immediately called on the masses of all classes in the village to work hard in production, putting forward the slogan of increasing production by three sheng per mu. He asked landlords and rich peasants to follow the peasants in labor and production, poor peasants and farm laborers should no longer wait to divide the fruits, and middle peasants should no longer be afraid of struggle. He stated that the Communist Party will resolutely guarantee labor to get rich. He himself first bought a female donkey to develop livestock. The general mood of everyone's production is also very good.\n\nParty members and cadres in various places should learn the following points from Xiang Tishui: 1. Resolutely believe in the Party and be loyal to the interests of the Party and the people. Believe that the Party will not abandon any Party member who can be reformed, and believe that the Party's policies and calls (such as Party rectification, land adjustment, and production) are for the benefit of the people. Resolutely correct all mistakes, and never harm the Party at any time due to personal problems (such as being emotional or collapsing). 2. When the Party calls, do it yourself first and lead the masses with action. In delivering manure and other production, Xiang Tishui has consistently demonstrated this exemplary spirit. 3. In work, link the Party's policies with the people's vital interests to persuade and improve the masses. When persuading each person, Xiang Tishui did not simply apply a set of dogmas but inspired them to accept the Party's call from their own interests. This working method can enable us to lead the broad masses to act together and never fall into isolation or failure.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 共产党员向提水领导生产不放松\n于丹　良玉\n1948-07-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　共产党员向提水领导生产不放松\n    太行壶关县头名劳动英雄共产党员向提水（十里村人），在今年生产中，无论思想上、行动上、对个人生产或对全村生产，都一直没有放松过。就是在整党民主最紧张的时候，他也仍在坚持生产，并宣传党的政策，帮助群众与其他村干解决糊涂思想，鼓励他们努力生产。土地法大纲颁布后，县区干部都开会学习去了，提水估计土改运动很快就要开始，但他并不消极等待，马上和支干向有顺商量：“咱们干部党员们赶快带起头来，把粪送了吧。闹开运动就没工夫送了，防备误了种地。”说罢，就带领自己的一队开始往地送粪，同时动员其他队群众也来送。许多群众对土地法摸不着底细，都怕白送了，不肯往前走。提水说：“大家该往哪块地送就赶快送吧，粪平分不了；就是抽补很少数地了，也得打粪钱和工资哩。不几天区干部回来一闹运动，耽误了生产，可是自己吃亏。”群众同意他的说法，他便领导大家讨论订出阴历正月初四到十三十天送完粪的计划。接着组织党员干部带头进行，全村便都行动起来。有少数中农思想仍有顾虑，但也跟着大家把粪送了。有四十多户因白天路泥，趁夜里地结着冰的时候点火把送。结果九天就把全村所有羊、驴、渣各种粪全部送到地里。\n    县区干部开会回来，工作组到十里村进行土改与整党。开始只开了一次支部会，对党员干部就一脚踢开不理了。但提水没有因此而躺倒，他对村长向怀兴说：“这次不比往常，主要深入发动贫雇，咱把饭给他们（工作组）派到贫雇家吧。把群众发动起来，咱们以后也好好走群众路线。”提水为使整党少耽误生产，事先就把本队的生产具体安排好，农业由向来兴负责，副业（特别是运输）由向松魁等负责。整党中全队农副业生产就没停顿。运输队到林县跑了九次，赚冀钞三十一万元。他媳妇不了解整党意义，以为要挨斗争，说：“咱这骡子恐怕也喂不好了。”提水说：“革命是革的叫老百姓富哩，不是叫咱穷哩，哪会有这事？整党是为整好。”他说服了她，她在整党期间织了十丈布。\n    提水不但对自己家里和本队生产负责，对全村也同样关心。整党开始，三大队的干部和群众都停止了生产，牲口有七天没走动。提水对领导生产的马有说：“你们九辆车，七头驴，按拉煤算，七天能拉三次，光九辆车算下来就少拉八千斤。一斤按九元算，也少赚七万二。牲口在家还要算草料。”三大队听了他的话，又重新运输开了。二大队见人家干得红，跟着也干起来了。\n    村里划阶级时，群众非常混乱。又正是种地时候，有三百多只羊没人踏圈。提水说：“斗争是斗封建剥削哩，不是斗圪堆堆哩，我不害怕。没人卧我卧。”这样大家的心才算开始安定下来，小秦则是新中农，等着想分东西，家里缺粪，也不踏圈卧羊。提水对他说：“不管怎样也得种地，种地就得上粪。是圪道的，卧上粪也要填；不是圪道的，不卧也填不上。等着干甚？不上粪，打不下粮食，是自己饿肚哩。”小秦则清醒了，踏了十几天粪。有些群众因怕抽动自己土地，惶惶不安，没心思生产，提水就结合本村情况宣传党的政策说：“咱村少地多地的户都不多，抽补也抽补不了多少，抽也是一亩二亩，补也是一亩二亩，不要因这少数耽误了多数。”\n    整党中，有的党员干部因为犯过些错误，心里很害怕，个别错误大的想到要寻死。提水说：“不用说咱还没犯了死罪；就是我罪大该死，也要叫党枪毙我，枪毙了我对党有利。人家会说共产党说真理，不要坏人。要自己寻了死，本来没问题也成了有问题。”又说：“咱们做工作犯了错，就和锄苗碰坏了锄一样，以后小心不要碰就对啦。怕坏了锄就不动弹是不对的。”因此他在整党期间仍坚持领导生产。运输队回来了，他就帮助算帐；运输队走了，就想法买下来，供再次运输。还抽空下地工作。\n    他自己在工作中自然也是有错误、有缺点的。比如对群众也发过脾气（多半是为了工作），有时工作方式生硬不灵活等。整党中，有少数人在对党员提意见时，把他这些缺点夸大起来，或提得与事实不符。甚至有的工作组同志也说：“整党没有你在南委泉开英雄会（四四年）端着吃好吧？”（编者按：这样讽刺党员的话，是不对的，是违背整党方针的，应改正。）提水当时很恼，心想：“那时候是党和群众培养我，今天是来教育我，让我来改正错误，为什么这样说呢？”所以曾下定决心，以后光做不说，这当然是不对的。但经过教育，很快又想通了。他说：“党培养咱也不是容易的。自己有了些经验，有意见不说，工作叫谁干？”从行动中看，他对自己的作风与态度已细心注意起来。如二队饭场上反映：“提水态度变得好啦。”\n    个人生产上，今年干得与往年一样有劲。施肥比去年更多。他种秋地约十二亩，去年上粪一千二百七十担，今年达到一千四百五十担，加上最近锄苗中上追肥四百担，每亩合计一百五十多担。他的榜样推动着全村，共准备上追肥一万二千担。现已上了二千四百担。金皇后和土玉茭准备普锄三遍。土改与整党结束后，提水马上号召全村各阶层群众努力生产，提出每亩增产三升的口号。他要求地主富农跟着农民劳动生产，贫雇农不要再等待分果实，中农也不要再怕斗争了。说明劳动致富，共产党一定坚决保障。他自己先买了一头牝驴，准备发展牲畜。大家生产情绪一般也很好。\n    各地党员干部应该从向提水学习以下几点：一、坚决相信党，忠实于党与人民的利益。相信党不会遗弃任何可以改造的党员，相信党的政策与号召（如整党、抽补与生产）是为着人民的利益。坚决改正一切错误，在任何时候不因个人问题（如闹情绪、躺倒）而损害党。二、党有号召，自己先做，以行动带领群众。在送粪与其他生产中，向提水都贯穿了这种模范精神。三、工作中把党的政策和群众切身利害联系起来，说服与提高群众。向提水在说服每个群众时，都不是硬搬教条的一套，而是从群众自身利害上启发其接受党的号召。这种工作方法可以使我们带起广大群众共同行动，永不陷于孤立或失败。"

    "content": "Glimpses of the Beining Railway Line\n    　　　　　Lin Jian\n  　　　　　(I) Militia in the Border Area\n    It was midnight on the twelfth, and the moon was about to set. Our troops had just emerged from the mountainous area of eastern Hebei and arrived at a small village at the foot of the mountains when we heard several gunshots, followed by the explosion of a hand grenade. Almost everyone whispered in unison, \"It must be the work of special agents. Damn it!\" The column did not stop, but moved slowly forward, detouring around some high ground and pools of water. Twenty minutes later, we finally entered a village. The village was extremely quiet, and not a single civilian came out. The courtyard we were assigned to had a gate made of straw and grass blocking the entrance. So everyone went in, woke up the owner, and used flashlights to look around to see if we could clear out a few rooms. Later, we found two rooms and went to sleep. However, no one had bothered to tell the people that we were the People's Liberation Army. The next day, we were still harboring the doubts of the night before. I asked the landlord, \"Is this an enemy-occupied area?\" She glanced at me and said, \"Enemy-occupied area? This is the edge of the liberated area!\" To this young woman, my words seemed to be a slander against her and her entire village. At this time, the sun had just risen, and the sound of artillery attacking Fengrun City was already booming. Later, I learned that due to the surprise nature of the troops' actions, no one knew that it was the People's Liberation Army who had come. The militia on sentry duty thought it was Chiang's bandits, so they fired their guns, and as a result, all the young and middle-aged men nearby ran away. A village cadre ran to a courtyard and, seeing vehicles everywhere, became anxious. Later, he heard a voice from the edge of the village saying, \"Don't trample on the crops of the villagers!\" Only then did he realize, \"Could this be our own army?\" An old woman in our courtyard said to me with a smile, \"They asked me to come out and see if the hats were worn straight or crooked. The hats of the 'recruitment teams' and local bullies are all worn tilted, perched on top of their heads. But when you hit them with the 'electric baton,' I couldn't see anything clearly. Why didn't you say something? It scared them into running more than ten miles out of the village.\" I said, \"The militia fired their guns, why didn't they hit them?\" She smiled and said, \"What can a few of them do? They can only give us a signal.\" Several young people in the room laughed. In fact, these militiamen had made heroic defenses. On the Tong(zhou)-Tang(shan) highway, they had captured eleven cars from Chiang's bandits; in Dongmazhuang, they shot down an enemy plane; and they used explosives to repel the invasion of four or five hundred Chiang's bandits and local bullies. The famous militia hero Liu Yong once led a platoon and defeated the attack of a platoon of Chiang's troops. All this happened not long ago. That very afternoon, our landlord's family, a family of \"Eighth Route Army\" members, all returned. One was a cadre in the village, one was working in the military region in a gray uniform and had returned home for recuperation half a month ago due to illness; one was a soldier in the local military corps, who had escorted prisoners back from Cuimazhuang that day and came home to visit. This family was very kind and amiable. They joined the revolutionary family to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang.\n    　　　　(II) The Pride of the People\n    The working people of a small village told us that although this is a plain, it is an old liberated area. Only one \"big belly\" (reactionary landlord) escaped from the whole village, and their work never lags behind. They talked a lot about the countless anecdotes that occurred during the Anti-Japanese War, saying that General Li Yunchang had to come to their village every year to hold a meeting and give a speech. Once again, I passed by a small village and stopped to rest and drink water under the shade of willows outside the village. I chatted casually with two farmers. I asked about the situation of joining the army. They said that there were more than a dozen military families in the whole village. I asked if anyone had joined the \"Central Army,\" and they replied, \"No.\" I asked again if anyone had joined the \"big bellies,\" and they said, \"Even less so.\" Their expressions were proud and reserved. I asked, \"Is this an old area or a semi-old area?\" He replied without hesitation, \"Old liberated area.\" \"How old?\" I asked with a smile. \"More than twenty years.\" I realized that this statement was not an exaggeration at all. Our working people will never forget the bloody struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique. These are things they take pride and glory in, and history is being written for the people's liberation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北宁线见闻\n林间\n1948-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北宁线见闻\n    林间\n  　　　　　（一）边缘区民兵\n    十二日夜半，月亮快西沉了。我们部队从冀东山地走出，刚刚到山边的一个小庄子，就听到几声枪响，接着是一颗手榴弹的爆炸声，大家几乎不约而同的小声说：“准是特务捣鬼。他妈的！”队伍没有停止下来，绕着一些凸地和水池慢慢的前进。二十分钟后，终于走进了一个村子。这村子静极了，没有一个老百姓出来。我们被分配的一家院子门口，是一扇柴草扎成的栅栏挡着。于是大家走进去，叫醒了主人，用手电四处照，看能誊几间房子。后来找好两间房子就睡了。但，谁也忘记告诉老百姓，我们是人民解放军。第二天，我们还抱着昨夜的疑虑。我问房东：“你们这里是不是敌占区？”她瞧了我一眼说：“敌占区？我们这里是解放区的边边！”对于这个年轻的妇女来说，我的话似乎是诬蔑了她和她的全村。这时太阳刚刚出来，进攻丰润城的炮声已在轰隆轰隆的响了。后来我才知道：由于部队的奇袭动作，没有一个人知道来的是解放军。放哨的民兵，以为是蒋匪，于是就鸣了枪，结果四近的青壮年都跑了，一个村干部跑到一座院子，见四外都是车队，他急了，后来他听见村边上一个声音说：“别踏坏老乡的庄稼！”他这才醒悟了：“这会不是自己的军队么？”我们院里一位大娘，笑着向我说：“她们要我出来，看看帽子是正戴还是歪戴，“壮丁队”和地方土顽的帽子都偏戴着，扣在头顶上的。可是，你们用“电棒”一打，我就什么也看不清了。怎么你们不说一声呢？吓的他们一气跑出村外十多里地。”我说：“民兵不是开枪了么，怎么不打呢？”她笑着说：“他们几个人顶什么事，只能给我们个讯。”屋子里几个青年都笑了。其实，这些民兵是曾做过英勇的防卫的。他们在通（州）唐（山）公路上，曾经缴获了蒋匪十一辆汽车；在东马庄，打落了敌人一架飞机；用爆破击退了四五百蒋匪地方土顽的进犯。著名的民兵英雄刘勇，曾率领一个排，打垮蒋军一个排的进攻。这都不过是不久以前的事。就在这天下午，我们房东，一家子“八路军”都回来了。一个是在村里当干部，一个是穿着灰军装的，在军区工作，因为有病，半个月前才回家休养的；一个是在地方兵团当战士的，当天从崔马庄押送俘虏回来，顺便来看家，这一家人，都非常亲切和霭。他们为打倒蒋介石匪帮，走向了革命的大家庭。\n    　　　　（二）人民的骄傲\n    一个小村的劳动人民告诉我们，虽说这儿是平原，但却是老解放区。全村只有一个“大肚皮”（反动地主）逃了出去，工作从来不落人后。他们大谈其抗日战争时代发生的无数轶事，说李运昌将军每年都要到他们村召开一次会讲话。又一回，我路过一个小村，在村外柳荫下歇下来喝水，和两个农民随便聊天，我问起参军情形，他们说：全村有十几家军属。我问有没有参加“中央军”的，他们回答说：“没有”。我又问有没有参加“大肚皮”的，他们说：“那更没有”。表情骄傲和矜持。我又问：“你们这是老区还是半老区呢？”他不加考虑就回答说：“老解放区”。“多老了？”我笑着发问。“有二十多年”。我领悟了这句话是丝毫也没有夸大的。我们的劳动人民，永远不会忘记和蒋介石统治集团的血的斗争。这些，在他们是引以为光荣和骄傲的，历史是要为在人民的翻身史上。"

TASS reports: The Foreign Ministers' Conference of eight countries, including the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary, concluded on June 24th.

The meeting drafted a statement regarding the decisions on Germany made at the London Six-Power Conference.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly passed the London Six-Power Agreements late at night on the 16th of this month by a margin of eight votes, with 297 votes in favor and 289 votes against. In this diplomatic debate, the French Communist Party's members of parliament consistently adhered to the people's stance and fundamentally opposed this agreement, which violates the French national interests. When the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee discussed this issue on the 9th of this month, the French Communist Party proposed a motion demanding the fundamental rejection of the London Agreements. On the 10th, the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a public statement authorizing the French Communist Party's members of parliament to vote against the \"London Agreements.\" A statement issued by the French Communist Party's parliamentary group pointed out: \"The suggestions of the London Conference are unacceptable because they will promote the resurgence of reactionary and aggressive forces in West Germany, and they will negate the genuine guarantees of French security and legitimate demands for compensation.\" The statement also emphasized that \"the London Agreements are the logical result of France deviating from its traditional allies—the Soviet Union and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe—and constantly sacrificing national interests to cater to the expansionist and aggressive plans of American millionaires and the reactionary schemes of a minority of privileged groups.\"\n　　Commenting on the French Parliament's passage of the London Agreements, a commentator for the Soviet newspaper Pravda pointed out on the 20th: \"Although the London decisions have been formally passed by the French Parliament, they will not be approved by the French people.

Eleven Chinese nuns accompanied them. All 22 nuns arrived safely in Tianjin on the 18th. Our reporter visited Sister Rutilia before their departure. Sister Rutilia and the nuns expressed their gratitude for the government's care and assistance in their return to their country. They held a solemn Mass on June 11th to pray for and bless the democratic government. When asked about the reason for their departure, Sister Rutilia said, \"This is an order from the Canadian Precious Blood Generalate. We do not want to leave, but the nuns of our order are obedient, and we can only obey the orders of our superiors.\" According to Sister Rutilia, after receiving the withdrawal instruction from the Precious Blood Generalate relayed by the U.S. Consulate in Peiping on May 3rd, two monks, Han Shoutian and Zhang Hongqi, took a letter to Tianjin to report the democratic government of the liberated area's protection of them, expressing their unwillingness to withdraw. The two monks returned with a joint letter and memorandum dated May 24th from the British and American Consulates in Tianjin, reiterating the order from the Superior General of the Precious Blood Society for the American, British, and Canadian nuns to withdraw from Xian County to Peiping or Tianjin. The order then decided to temporarily withdraw to Tianjin to await further instructions. When talking about her feelings about this withdrawal, Sister Rutilia expressed her nostalgia for the liberated area, saying, \"We do not want to leave. We came to China, and we love China. But the orders of our superiors must be obeyed.\" Finally, Sister Rutilia said, \"We have nothing else but to pray for and bless the democratic government.\" It is noted that the U.S. Consul General in Peiping sent a letter notifying the Precious Blood Society of the Catholic Church of twelve foreign nuns to return to their country. Among them, one British nun, Sister Dolores (religious name: Saint Maria), according to Sister Rutilia, passed away on March 13th last year. Therefore, only eleven foreign nuns left this time.\n\nXinhua News Agency, North China, 29th: The eleven foreign nuns of the Precious Blood Society who went from Xian County to Tianjin to return to their country, and the eleven Chinese nuns of the order who accompanied them, left the border of the liberated area on the morning of the 16th. When they bid farewell to the escort personnel sent by our government, they sent a letter to the Xian County Democratic Government to express their gratitude. The original letter stated: \"Dear Sirs: We are beginning the third day of our journey by water. Before your representative leaves us, we wish to express once again our sincere gratitude for your help and protection. Your representative was thoughtful and did everything possible to facilitate our journey. Our gratitude cannot be expressed in words. The journey so far has been excellent. Everyone is well, and even enjoying the journey very much. Although we are far from Xian County, we will never forget you in our daily prayers. We only express again our sincere and profound gratitude. All the nuns of the Precious Blood Society. June 16th, 1948.\" It is noted that the nuns traveled by car sent by the democratic government from Xian County to Botou on the 12th, arriving on the same day. On the 14th, they boarded a canal boat in Botou and arrived in Tianjin on the 18th. When they left the border of the liberated area on the 16th, they signed a certificate of safe departure and sent letters to Father Cui Buyun, the President of the Jesuit Church of the Catholic Church in Xian County, and Father Ji Zhixun (Frenchman) of the church, reporting their safe journey. According to a United Press dispatch from Peiping on the 17th, the so-called spokesman of the Catholic Church in Peiping made remarks to smear the Chinese Communist Party, saying how the democratic government of the liberated area had detained and abused these nuns, and their travel letters are the best answer to these slanders. An Associated Press dispatch from Tianjin on the 19th also stated that the nuns who arrived in Tianjin confirmed to reporters that the rumors that the Communists abused them were not true.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 在我民主政府协助下　献县外籍修女赴津返国　离境时函谢民主政府\n\n1948-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　在我民主政府协助下\n    献县外籍修女赴津返国\n    离境时函谢民主政府\n    【新华社华北二十九日电】河北中部献县城附近张家庄天主堂宝血会十一名外籍修女，内包括该会修道院院长冉茹利亚氏（加籍），在当地民主政府协助下于六月十二日由献县首途赴天津返国。十一名中国籍修女偕行。全体修女二十二人已于十八日平安抵津。本社记者于他们行前，曾走访冉茹利亚。冉氏及众修女对政府平日之关怀，及此次协助返国至为感激，曾于六月十一日做大弥撒为民主政府祈祷祝福。当记者询及撤离原因时，冉氏说：“这是加拿大宝血总会的命令，我们都不愿意走；但是本会修女是顺从的，长上的命令只能服从。”据冉氏称：她接获五月三日由美驻平领事馆转来的宝血总会的撤离指示后，曾由韩受天、张洪起两修士携函赴津报告解放区民主政府对她们的保护情形，表示不愿撤离。该两修士携回英、美驻津领事五月廿四日公函及备忘录，重申宝血总会长令美、英、加籍修女由献县撤至北平或天津的命令。该会始决定暂撤至天津待命。在谈到此次撤离感想时，冉氏表示对解放区甚为留恋，她说：“我们都不愿意走。我们到了中国，我们爱中国。可是长上的命令总得服从。”最后，冉氏说：“我们没有别的，只有为民主政府祈祷祝福。”按美国驻北平总领事曾来函通知该天主堂宝血会十二名外籍修女返国，其中英籍修女何多洛德（教名圣马利亚）一名，据冉茹利亚称已于去年三月十三日病逝。故此次离境之外籍修女只十一人。\n    【新华社华北廿九日电】由献县赴津返国的十一名宝血会外籍修女，及偕行的十一名该会中国修女，于十六日晨离解放区边境。她们在与我政府所派之护送人员作别时，特致函献县民主政府表示感谢。原信称：“亲爱的先生们：我们正开始水路行程之第三日。在贵代表离开我们之前，愿再度向你们表示对于帮助及保护我们之衷心感谢。贵代表思虑周到，凡能便利旅行之事，无一不做到。我们的感激非言词所能表达。旅程迄今均属绝佳。全体安好，甚且对行程极感愉快。我们虽远离献县，但在每日祈祷中，将永远不忘记你们。仅再度表示我们虔诚而深刻的感激。宝血会全体修女们。一九四八年六月十六日。”按该修女等系于十二日乘民主政府所派之汽车由献县至泊头，当日到达。十四日在泊头搭运河船，于十八日抵津。她们于十六日离开解放区边境时，曾签字于安全离境之证件上，并曾分别致函献县天主堂耶稣会院长崔步云神甫和该堂籍志逊（法人）神父，报告旅途平安。按合众社北平十七日电，曾发表所谓北平天主教教会发言人的谈话来污蔑中共，说解放区民主政府曾经如何地扣留并虐待这些修女，她们的旅途书信乃是对于这些污蔑的最好答复。美联社天津十九日电亦称：到天津后的修女们向记者证实，共产党虐待他们的谣言不是事实。"

    "content": "[Taihang News] Besieged in isolated strongholds in northern Henan such as Anyang and Jiaozuo, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops and local bandits have surrendered to us one after another in recent months under the impact of our mass political offensives, bringing with them a considerable number of machine guns, rifles, and other weapons. They have been welcomed by our democratic government. During this period of political offensive, our military and civilians in various areas have implemented the correct policy of our Party and our army in winning over the broad masses of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet soldiers and lower-ranking officers, publicizing the lenient policy that \"those who return will not only not be killed, but those whose homes are in the liberated areas will also be given a share of land, and those whose homes are not in the liberated areas will be given travel expenses if they wish to return, and those who bring weapons will be rewarded.\" A soldier of Chiang’s 40th Division, whose home was in a village in the Third District of Ye County, did not initially believe in our policy. After secretly returning to his village to inquire, he was happy to find that it was indeed the case, and he ran back to his original unit and colluded with several other soldiers to return together. During the wheat protection campaign, the soldiers within the Jiangjun stronghold, which is part of Bo'ai, understood our policy and spread the word: \"The Communist Party's policy is even better.\" Within seven days, nine local Chiang Kai-shek soldiers returned. A company commander of the Chiang army, whose home was in Chu Wang Village, Zhangnan, also defected to our side with more than eight hundred rounds of ammunition. In terms of methods for disintegrating the enemy army, various localities have created experience in launching mass political offensives, namely, armed penetration into the heart of Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn areas to carry out propaganda and launch mass \"calling for husbands and sons\" movements. A certain unit and the Zhangnan, Ye County, and Tangyin counties of the Fifth Military District used the above method to launch a political offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops in the isolated city of Anyang. From April 8th to 25th, in half a month, they disintegrated and brought back one hundred and eighty-three Chiang Kai-shek stubborn soldiers. In a village in the Second District of Ye County, forty-one Chiang Kai-shek stubborn soldiers were called back to their hometowns. The father of a puppet soldier in a village in the Fourth District personally went to Anyang City to call his son back after hearing about the Land Law. His son then won over four puppet soldiers to return together. Huangtun Village in Bo'ai warmly settled a Chiang Kai-shek soldier ××× who returned and allocated two acres of wheat land to him. He excitedly said: \"I have finally seen the light of day.\" In addition, large numbers of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army soldiers deserted. In the Liu Shoushan unit of the puppet Anyang Security Regiment, which had more than three hundred and forty people, more than one hundred took the opportunity to escape during our army's victorious strikes in the first half of June. The broad masses of soldiers under the strict surveillance and control of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are all looking forward to the People's Liberation Army liberating them soon. Chiang Kai-shek's puppet soldiers in ×× city secretly discussed: \"If the Liberation Army comes, which turtle won't surrender!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开展群众性政治攻势　豫北蒋匪纷纷投诚\n\n1948-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开展群众性政治攻势\n    豫北蒋匪纷纷投诚\n    【太行讯】困守豫北安阳、焦作等孤立据点的蒋伪土顽，数月来在我群众性的政治进攻下，纷纷向我投诚，并带来不少机枪、步枪等武器，受到我民主政府的欢迎，这一段政攻中，我各地军民都执行了我党我军争取蒋伪广大士兵及下级军官的正确政策，宣传了“归来者不但不杀，家乡在解放区的，还分给一份土地，家不在解放区的，愿回者发给路费，携械归来者并给予奖励”等宽大政策。家在我邺县三区某村的蒋四十师一士兵，开头对我政策不大相信，经过秘密回村打探，如道果真如此，高兴的跑回原部，又串通了几个士兵，集体归来。护麦战中，博爱属将军据点内的士兵了解了我们的政策，纷纷传说：“共产党的政策更好了。”七天内即有九个土蒋士兵归来。家在我漳南楚旺庄的蒋军某连长，亦携带八百余粒子弹投奔我方。在争取瓦解敌军的方式上，各地创造了开展群众性政治进攻的经验，即是武装深入蒋顽心脏区，展开宣传，发动群众性的“叫夫索子”运动。某部与五分区漳南、邺县、汤阴等县，即是用上述办法对安阳孤城蒋伪展开政治攻势，从四月八日到二十五日半月中，即瓦解回一百八十三名蒋顽土兵。邺县二区某村就有四十一个蒋顽士兵被叫回乡。四区某村一个伪军的父亲听了土地法后，亲至安阳城叫他儿子回来。他儿子又争取了四个伪军一块归来。博爱黄屯村对归来的蒋军士兵×××热情安置，并分给二亩麦地。他兴奋的说：“我算是见到青天啦。”另外，蒋顽匪军士兵大批逃亡。伪安阳保安团刘寿山部，三百四十余人，六月上半月在我军胜利打击下，乘机逃跑者百余人。在蒋匪严密监视看管下的广大士兵，都盼着人民解放军早日解放他们。××城蒋伪士兵暗暗谈论：“要是解放军打来，那个鳖才不投降哩！”"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th – Contrary to the assertions of the likes of Stuart and his Chinese apologists, American imperialism is still actively re-arming Japan and restoring Japanese militarism. According to an expert familiar with the situation in Japan, who recently returned from Japan to the Shandong liberated area via Qingdao: MacArthur Headquarters has recently established an organization similar to the former Japanese military headquarters, abbreviated as \"ZEF,\" ostensibly to organize the police, but in reality, it is secretly responsible for recruiting, training, and arming the Japanese army. Japanese who are now enlisting under the guise of police are required to serve for five years, and are trained in units of battalions, with 700 to 900 men per battalion. It is expected that 300 battalions will be completed by the end of 1949. Tokyo Japanese rumors say that MacArthur Headquarters plans to use this force to establish several U.S.-Japanese mixed brigades, that is, each brigade consists of five Japanese battalions and one American battalion, plus some artillery, tanks, and other special forces staffed exclusively by American troops. The expert also said that \"ZEF\" is also implementing a three-year plan to rebuild Japanese military bases, attempting to rebuild Japanese naval bases and construct several heavy bomber airfields, military warehouses, barracks, and military highways within the next three years. Such huge military warehouses have already been established in the Tokyo area and on Kyushu Island. Other work in the plan is being carried out by the U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan, who are forcing Japanese workers, farmers, and intellectuals to build them. However, it is heard that the general Japanese people are not as enthusiastic about this as the United States hopes. Japanese people in Kyushu and Hokkaido often engage in slowdowns and strikes. Japanese engineers and technicians also refuse to participate in such military construction projects.\n\nNote: According to an article titled \"The Revival of Militaristic Japan\" published in the 12th issue of the 17th volume of \"World Knowledge\" in Shanghai: According to official figures, Japan currently has 30,000 regular police officers, 95,000 autonomous police officers, and about 8,000 more were added in May of this year, for a total of 133,000. At the same time, under the pretext of \"dealing with riots,\" it is said that they are planning to increase the number to 300,000. Before the war, the Japanese army's standing army was only 230,000. The planned 300,000 armed police are equivalent to the total number of standing army police before the war. The highest institution currently commanding the Japanese police is the \"National Security Committee,\" which is directly under the Prime Minister and is actually a disguised Ministry of the Army. The \"police control districts\" in various places are disguised \"military control districts.\" The Police Administration University, established on May 1 of this year, is a disguised Army University or Officer Candidate School. Therefore, the Japanese army will soon restore its pre-war troop strength, equipment, and organization. According to a statement issued earlier this month by 291 prominent figures from all walks of life in China protesting the United States' support of Japan: many former Japanese military cadres have now become police officers or are lurking in military-organized development groups. The number of police officers has gradually increased from 65,000 before the war to 125,000, and is actually said to have reached 300,000. The number of firearms was originally one for every five people, but now it is planned to change to one for each person. Ashida has recently used the pretext of preparing for the occurrence of a national emergency to establish a special training unit. These materials can corroborate and supplement the above-mentioned expert's remarks. The \"police\" of the 300 battalions that MacArthur plans to complete by the end of 1949, as mentioned by a certain expert, will total approximately 210,000 to 270,000 people at that time, which is not far from the number of 300,000 mentioned in these materials.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 恢复日寇侵略势力铁证如山　美帝重新武装日本  事实证明司徒及其中国辩士狡辩破产\n\n1948-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　恢复日寇侵略势力铁证如山\n    美帝重新武装日本\n    事实证明司徒及其中国辩士狡辩破产\n    【新华社山东二十九日电】与司徒雷登辈及其中国辩护士们的断言相反，美帝国主义仍在积极重新武装日本，恢复日本军国主义。据由青岛来山东解放区的一位新从日本返国，熟悉该国情况的专家谈：麦克阿瑟总部近已设置一类似过去日本军部之机构，简称为“ＺＥＦ”，借口组织警察，实则秘密担任征召、编训、与武装日本陆军的职务。现在以警察名义入伍的日人，规定服役期为五年，以营为单位进行训练，每营七百至九百人，预期一九四九年底将完成三百个营。东京日人传说，麦克阿瑟总部计划将来以此种武力建立若干美日混成旅，即每一旅由五个日本营及一个美国营组成，另附以若干专由美军担任的炮兵、战车及其他特种部队。该专家又称，“ＺＥＦ”还正在实行另一个重建日本军事基地的三年计划，企图在今后三年之内，重建日本各海军基地，并修建若干重轰炸机机场、军事仓库、兵营及适于军用之公路等。此类巨大军事仓库，已在东京一带及九州岛上建立。计划中之其他工作，亦正由美驻日军事当局强迫日本工人农民以及知识分子为其兴建。但闻日本一般人民对此并不如美国所希望的积极，九州与北海道的日人且经常进行怠工、罢工。日本工程师及技师亦有拒绝参加此类军事建筑计划者。\n    按：据上海“世界知识”十七卷十二期刊载“军国日本的复活”一文称：日本现有警察依官方数字为正规警察三万名，自治警察九万五千名，本年五月约增八千名，共十三万三千名，同时借口“应付暴动”，据说又要计划增加到三十万名。战前日本陆军常备军不过二十三万名。计划中的三十万名武装警察，即已相当于战前常备军警的总和。现在指挥日警的最高机构，为直辖首相之“国家保安委员会”，实为变相的陆军省。各地的“警管区”，则为变相的“军管区”，本年五月一日成立的警政大学，就是变相的陆军大学或士官学校。故日本陆军不久就要恢复到战前的兵额、装备和组织。又据本月初中国各界名流二百九十一人抗议美国扶植日本的声明称：前日本军事干部，现多变为警察或潜伏于军事编制的开拓团中。警察人数已由战前之六万五千，陆续扩充至十二万五千，实际据说已到三十万。枪支原本五人一支，现拟改为每人一支。芦田近又借口准备国家非常状态发生，将成立特别训练部队。这些材料，与上述某专家谈话可以互相印证补充。某专家所谈麦克阿瑟计划于一九四九年底完成三百个营的“警察”，其总人数届时约为二十一万至二十七万人，与这些材料中所称三十万人之数已相差不远。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 28th: A frontline reporter reports on the process of the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Kaifeng, stating: After the People's Liberation Army cleared out the outer strongholds of Kaifeng, it completed the encirclement of the city with swift movements on the night of the 16th. At dusk on the 17th, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack from all directions. A certain unit, after 20 minutes of fierce fighting, first broke through the enemy's first line of defense in the South Gate, seized the airport, and forced the remnants of the enemy on the east and west sides of Zhongshan Road to gradually retreat, compressing them to the line of the post office and China Middle School. Another unit occupied the South Kaifeng Agricultural Experiment Station and destroyed an enemy armored train reinforcing along the railway. At 12 o'clock that night, another unit of the People's Liberation Army attacked Caoguan, and after an hour of combat, annihilated most of an enemy battalion. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army, attacking Songguan and Xiguan, also made smooth progress, controlling all of Songguan and approaching the West Gate. At 2:30 p.m. on the 18th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general offensive against the isolated stronghold of the enemy at the South Gate Post Office. After a fierce artillery bombardment, the enemy's steel-reinforced concrete fortifications were destroyed, and despite enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, they charged courageously. By 5:00 p.m., the entire enemy force at the post office was annihilated. The brigade commander of the Chiang bandit's Henan Provincial Security First Brigade was killed here. At 11:00 p.m. that night, under the cover of heavy artillery, the People's Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on the Kaifeng city wall. Around 1:00 a.m. on the 19th, several spearheads advanced successively towards the Dananmen, Xin'nanmen, and Songmen, constantly repelling the enemy's counterattacks and consolidating the breakthrough points. Five platoons of a certain battalion of the People's Liberation Army, which had stormed into Xin'nanmen, independently persisted in combat for as long as seven hours. At about 10:00 a.m., the West Gate had already been captured by our army, and then a large number of follow-up troops of the People's Liberation Army entered the city simultaneously from various gates. The People's Liberation Army, which had stormed into Songmen, advanced southward along the city wall, joining forces with the fraternal troops that had stormed into Xin'nanmen, while crossing the Huiji River, advancing step by step and consolidating section by section. Soon, they joined forces with the People's Liberation Army that had stormed into Dananmen and Ximen, occupying all the enemy's artillery positions in the southwest of the city. That night, the People's Liberation Army continued to develop its offensive in the urban area. The enemy's morale was low, and they collapsed at a touch in the street fighting. By 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, the remaining enemy forces were finally compressed to the area west of Gonghe Road within the North Gate, including the North China Sports Field and Zhongshan Park. At 12:00 p.m., the People's Liberation Army captured the Chiang Kai-shek's Henan Provincial Government, capturing more than 3,000 Chiang soldiers alive. At dawn on the 21st, the People's Liberation Army continued to break through the enemy's core fortifications at the Jiaoyangyuan east of the Huiji River, completely annihilating the defending enemy. Subsequently, the enemy continued to bomb and strafe with artillery and aircraft, completely destroying the Jiaoyangyuan buildings, but the People's Liberation Army resolutely defended the positions they had gained, not yielding an inch of land. At about 9:00 a.m., two rows of enemy soldiers on the enemy's northwestern position of the Jiaoyangyuan raised white flags and surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. At 5:00 p.m., the People's Liberation Army launched a final general offensive against the enemy's core fortifications at the Gulongting. As soon as the artillery bombardment stopped, the heroic \"Guo Jisheng\" company assault team bravely rushed to the highest hall in only eight minutes, and another unit of the People's Liberation Army also rushed in, completely annihilating the enemy's 66th Division headquarters. By this point, the main positions and the general command of the Kaifeng defenders had been completely captured and annihilated. Only one or two isolated group bunkers remained to be eliminated. This was completed by noon on the 22nd.

General Zhao expressed his admiration for the spirit of the people of Yan'an, who are actively rebuilding the new Yan'an while fighting against the famine and enthusiastically supporting the front. He pointed out that the liberation of Yan'an is closely related to the large-scale advance of our army into the Jing and Wei River basin. Regarding this Jing and Wei River operation, General Zhao, after describing our army's victory in annihilating nearly 20,000 enemies and capturing 14 cities, particularly emphasized the following two points: First, our army was completely proactive and planned the enemy's movements. For example, a part of our army besieged Yan'an and Luochuan, attracting the enemy's Pei Changhui Corps to reinforce from western Henan and southeastern Shaanxi, crowding them at the southern end of the Xian-Yu Highway. When we crossed the Jing River in large strides and swept the north bank of the Wei River, the Pei enemy hurriedly moved westward. The enemy's deployment was completely disrupted, while we not only completed the expected tasks of the Jing and Wei River operation, but also liberated Yan'an and Luochuan, consolidating the Guanzhong and Huanglong districts in the southern part of the border region. General Zhao said with a smile: \"Hu Zongnan's army also has to listen to Deputy Commander Peng's orders.\" The other point is the people of Greater Guanzhong's loyalty, support, and love for our army. After listing many moving examples, General Zhao said: \"Chairman Mao told us: 'The direction of the people's hearts is the decisive factor that constantly plays a role in victory.' This is truly a profound truth.

Among the 473 fugitive households returning from Qi County, Ye County, Hui County, and Jiaozuo, there were 55 landlords and rich peasants. Prior to this, all localities had corrected the \"leftist\" sentiments among district and village cadres and a small number of the masses who were unwilling to win over the return of fugitive households. Then, they went deep into the KMT-controlled areas, combined with armed attacks, launched political offensives, widely publicized the Outline Land Law, publicized the specific facts of our localities compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants, returning industrial and commercial properties, and resettling landlords and rich peasants who were swept out of their homes. They exposed the enemy's deceptive propaganda, so from March to May, the number of fugitive households returning home gradually increased. They also launched the \"five calls\" movement, secretly colluding with each other to return home. After Sun Libao, a fugitive household in Nanyang Village, Second District of Qi County, was resettled, he actively went to the KMT-controlled area to collude with eight fugitive households in his village to return home. After Song Xiang, a middle peasant from Mazhuang in the county, fled, a pig from his family was slaughtered and eaten by the district office; this time, after he returned, the district compensated him with a large, fat pig. The government and the people have properly resettled those who returned, helping them to restore and develop production. All localities have successively held forums for fugitive households to conduct policy education, further dispelling their doubts and concerns, and stabilizing their emotions. Some villages in the Sixth District of Qi County also held a get-together (middle and poor peasants), talking to each other and expressing condolences, quickly eliminating barriers. Many villages in Ji County mobilized mass resettlement, and some masses who gained more fruits automatically returned land to compensate wrongly struggled fugitive households. The 84 fugitive households who returned from the Third and Fourth Districts of the county have all been resettled. Qi County corrected the class status of wrongly struggled fugitive households and made compensation. Xinxiang gave wrongly struggled fugitive households land equivalent to that of middle peasants. Huixian stipulated that wrongly struggled middle and poor peasants be given various rights to participate in farmers' associations, militia, and self-defense forces. Land and houses were also appropriately adjusted for landlords and rich peasants, and resettlement was carried out using relief loans and other methods. The masses in Jia Village, Ji County, also helped six fugitive households who returned home plow 68 mu of wasteland with livestock and other means. The government also issued relief grain to solve their production difficulties. Li Tingke, who had been a puppet Bao chief, expressed his determination to correct his past mistakes and is now working hard at ginning cotton and engaging in production, earning more than one dou of rice a day. After Qi Xiaoqun's family, a fugitive household in Pang Village, Qi County, returned, the village government adjusted 21 mu of land to him, allowing him to participate in a mutual aid group and work together. It was also decided to provide loans to help him buy livestock. He excitedly said: \"The two sides (referring to our area and the KMT-occupied area) are really two different worlds!\" After the masses' lives stabilized, everyone's enthusiasm for fighting against the enemy also increased. Li ××, a fugitive household in Guanzi Village, Qi County, in order to defend his newly established good life, took the initiative to find government staff and requested to participate in armed forces, vowing to fight the KMT bandits to the end under the leadership of the democratic government.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 辉县焦作等地逃亡户返乡　我政府妥为安置\n\n1948-07-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　辉县焦作等地逃亡户返乡\n    我政府妥为安置\n    【太行讯】自土地法大纲公布后，特别是端正各种政策以来，据辉县、修武等九个县统计，豫北逃亡蒋区者先后有一万五千三百六十四人还乡，并在我民主政府安置下先后转向生产与对敌斗争。淇县、邺县、辉县、焦作返回的四百七十三个逃亡户中，有地主富农五十五人。事先，各地均改正了区村干部与少数群众中不愿争取逃亡户返乡的左倾情绪，接着深入蒋区，结合武装出击，开展政攻，广泛宣传土地法大纲，宣传我各地补偿错斗中农与退还工商业，以及安置扫地出门的地主富农等具体事实，揭发敌人的欺骗宣传，所以从三月到五月，逃亡户还乡者日渐增多。他们并开展了五叫运动，秘密相互串通返乡。淇县二区南阳村逃亡户孙礼保得到安置后，积极去蒋区串通本村八家逃亡户返乡。该县马庄中农宋祥逃亡后，家里一口猪被区公所杀吃了；这次他回来后，区上赔偿他一口大肥猪。对一般逃亡归来者，我政府与人民均妥为安置，扶助其恢复与发展生产。各地先后召开逃亡户座谈会进行政策教育，进一步解除其怀疑与顾虑，安定其情绪。淇县六区有的村并召开联欢会（中、贫农），彼此谈心，进行慰问，很快消除了隔膜。汲县不少村发动群众性的安置，有些多得果实的群众自动退地补偿错斗逃亡户。该县三、四区返回的八十四户逃亡户，均已得到安置。淇县对错斗逃亡户订正了成份，做了补偿。新乡给错斗逃亡户均安置到相当于中农的土地。辉县规定给予错斗中贫农以参加农会、民兵、自卫队等各种权利，对地主富农亦适当调剂给土地、房屋，并用救济借贷等办法进行了安置。汲县贾庄村群众还以牲口等帮助返乡的六户逃亡户犁荒地六十八亩。政府并发给救济粮，解决其生产中的困难。当过伪保长的李庭科表示坚决改正过去错误，现正努力轧花搞生产，一天能赚一斗多米。淇县庞村逃亡户齐小群全家返回后，村政府调剂给他二十一亩地，让他参加互助组，变工耕种，并决定以贷款扶助买牲口。他激动的说：“两头（指我区与蒋占区）真是两个世界！”群众生活安定后，大家对敌斗争的积极性亦提高。淇县贯子村逃亡户李××为保卫其新建立的好光景，主动找到政府工作人员，要求参加武装，宣誓要在民主政府领导下与蒋匪干到底。"

    "content": "Utilizing Agricultural Off-Seasons\nTaihang Masses Engage in Sideline Occupations\n\n[Taihang News] Comprehensive Report: Many areas in Taihang have achieved great success by engaging in sideline production such as transportation and weaving during agricultural off-seasons. According to incomplete statistics from 84 villages in 10 counties, including Pingshun, Lucheng, Wuxiang, Lingchuan, Licheng, Yuanshi, Heshun, Huguan, Xiyang, and Xiangyuan, the profits from sideline occupations reached 63,949,900+ yuan (Jibi currency, same below). In Aozhi and 16 other villages in the fourth district of Pingshun alone, they earned 37,600,000 yuan from sideline occupations in four months this spring, overcoming the spring famine, supplementing the daily expenses of the masses, and also buying 79 head of livestock. After understanding the Party's policy of rectification and stabilizing their emotions, cadres and Party members in the first district of Heshun led the masses to seize the agricultural slack season to carry out various sideline productions, earning 11,000,000+ yuan in two months and overcoming the spring famine. Zhao Maohai, the production team leader of Liugou Village in the second district of Wuxiang, after leading the completion of spring plowing, immediately seized the gap and led eight groups to pull coal, boil saltpeter, and burn lime, earning 3,192,900 yuan and 33 dan and 6 dou of rice in one month. Zhao Linyuan, a middle peasant, understood our Party's policy towards middle peasants and went to carry coal whenever he had free time, earning more than 100,000 yuan by himself. In many areas with more serious spring famines, the enthusiasm of the masses for sideline production is even higher. Ma Yueshan, a labor hero in Xichuan Village in the third district of Huguan, led the mutual aid team to squeeze out labor and animal power to engage in sideline occupations while sowing and hoeing wheat, selling grain, used clothes, and mountain goods. Ma Demao, the director of the cooperative, led women to go up the mountain to cut small leaves and boil them to dye black cloth. Agricultural work was not delayed at all, and they earned 1,545,500+ yuan and 13,000 jin of coal, solving the difficulty of burning coal during the summer busy season. Under the slogan of \"organizing mutual assistance, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and self-salvation through production,\" ten villages including Lujiayu, Zhaobi, and Mengbi in Xiyang meticulously organized the surplus labor force and sought various production avenues. For example, selling eggs, transporting pig iron, carrying coal, boiling saltpeter, selling paper, opening iron furnaces, opening coal kilns, cutting mountain goods, and digging medicinal materials, earning a total of 5,600,000+ yuan, as well as 7 shi and 1 dou of corn and 1 shi and 6 dou of millet. The land was not barren, the stomachs were not hungry, and four donkeys and mules were bought back. Sideline production in Mengbi Village solved the problem of no food for 26 households with 104 people. Others, such as Pianliangtou in the fifth district of Xiangyuan, all 12 households in the village \"work in the fields during the busy season and do brush-making during the slack season.\" Feng Ergou and two others alone squeezed out time to make 180 brushes in 70 days, earning 5,216,000+ yuan, enough to buy 7 shi and 8 dou of rice. At present, the summer harvest is coming to an end in various places. Many villages are combining hoeing seedlings, adjusting labor and animal power, and squeezing out labor and time to engage in sideline occupations to increase income.\n\n[Taiyue News] Dahe and Yue Village in the second district of Yicheng have gained great profits by digging medicinal materials and transporting charcoal during agricultural off-seasons. After the spring plowing and sowing were completed, Li Pinyuan and Hou Sheng, the managers of the Dahe Cooperative, organized the masses to squeeze out time to go up the mountain to dig Atractylodes lancea. The cooperative's drugstore first organized more than 20 people to take the lead in going up the mountain, and they dug three to four hundred jin in ten days, which could be sold for more than 500,000 yuan. Seeing that they gained a lot of profit, the masses, both men and women, young and old, went up the mountain to dig medicine, and they dug more than 5,000 jin in less than 20 days. Just as the Handan medicine merchants came here to buy, they sold 6,000,000 yuan at once, enough to cover the whole village's annual expenses for salt and cotton. Ma Liji and Ma You of Yue Village also squeezed out time to organize the masses in Nanma, Lengquan, and Laowanggou villages to burn and transport charcoal, with a total of 98 people and more than 20 livestock participating. They transported more than 32,400 jin of charcoal in 25 days, earning 3,888,000 yuan. An old man in his sixties also earned 30,000 yuan. Only two or three households in the entire Yue Village did not participate, and each household earned an average of 30,000 to 60,000 yuan, which not only solved the spring famine in the whole village, but also bought two livestock.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 利用农忙空隙　太行群众搞副业\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　利用农忙空隙\n    太行群众搞副业\n    【太行讯】综合报导：太行许多地区利用农忙空隙进行运输、纺织等副业生产获得很大成绩。据平顺、潞城、武乡、陵川、黎城、元氏、和顺、壶关、昔阳、襄垣等十个县八十四个村庄不完全统计，副业获利达六千三百九十四万九千九百余元（冀钞，下同）。仅平顺四区奥治等十七个村，在今春四个月中，副业赚洋三千七百六十万元，克服了春荒，添补了群众日常零用，还买进牲口七十九头。和顺一区各村干部党员了解整党政策、稳定情绪后，领导群众抓紧农闲进行多方面的副业生产，两个月赚洋一千一百余万元，渡过了春荒。武乡二区柳沟村生产队长赵毛孩领导着完成春耕后，即抓紧空隙，领导八个组，拉煤、熬硝、烧石灰等，一个月赚洋三百一十九万二千九百元，赚米三十三石六斗。中农赵林元了解了我党对中农的政策，一有空闲就去驮煤，一个人就赚洋十万余元。不少春荒较严重地区，群众进行副业生产的情绪更高。壶关三区西川村劳动英雄马月山领导互助大队，在下种锄麦中，挤出劳畜力搞副业，贩卖粮食、估衣、山货。合作社长马德茂领导妇女上山割小里叶，煮染黑布，农事一点没耽误，还赚洋一百五十四万五千余元，拉煤一万三千斤，解决了夏忙中烧煤的困难。昔阳路家峪、赵壁、孟壁等十个村在“组织互助、农副业结合，生产自救”的口号下，细密地组织了剩余劳力，寻找各种生产门路。如贩卖鸡蛋、运生铁、担煤、熬硝、卖纸、开铁炉、开煤窑、砍山货、刨药材，共获利五百六十余万元，另玉茭七石一斗，小米一石六斗。地没荒，肚没饿，还买回驴骡四头。孟壁村的副业生产解决了二十六户一百零四口人没饭吃的困难。其他如襄垣五区偏梁头，全村十二户扎刷布刷，“农忙上地农闲干”。仅冯二苟等三个人，七十天内抽空扎了一百八十个，即赚五百二十一万六千余元，可买米七石八斗。目前各地夏收快要结束，不少村庄结合锄苗，调剂劳畜力，挤出劳力与时间搞副业，以增加收入。\n    【太岳讯】翼城二区大河、岳庄等村，利用农忙空隙挖药材运木炭，得利很大。春耕下种完了，大河合作社经理李丕元、侯升同志即组织群众，抽空上山挖苍术。合作社药铺先组织了二十多个人带头上山，十天工夫就挖了三四百斤，能卖五十多万元，群众看到得利很多，男女老少都上山挖药，不到二十天就挖了五千多斤。正好邯郸药商来此收买，一下卖了六百万元，足够全村全年食盐、棉花的开销。岳庄村马立吉、马有等也抽空组织南马、冷泉、老王沟等村群众烧运木炭，共有九十八个人，二十多个牲口参加，二十五天运炭三万二千四百多斤，赚洋三百八十八万八千元，有个六十多岁的老汉也赚了三万元。岳庄全村只两三户没参加，每户平均赚到三万元至六万元，除解决了全村春荒外，还买了两个牲口。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. TASS, Moscow, 24th: The Warsaw Conference, attended by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary, issued a declaration on the 24th, strongly condemning the decisions of the London Conference on the German issue, presided over by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, with the participation of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. The declaration exposed that the decisions aimed at dividing Germany, obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, resisting the demilitarization and democratization of Germany, restoring Germany's war potential, and subordinating West Germany's economy to US and British capital. The declaration, following the spirit of the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements, proposed specific suggestions for rapidly resolving the German issue through a four-power agreement. The full text of the declaration, excluding the preamble, is as follows:\n\n　　　　(1)\nThe decisions of the London Conference are a direct step towards the completion of the division and disintegration of Germany. After the US, British, and French governments abandoned their previously announced promises of political and economic unity for Germany, the London Conference prepared to establish a West German government, separated from the rest of Germany, through the aforementioned separatist actions of these countries. To achieve this goal, it was stipulated to convene a specially selected constitutional assembly, including representatives from the states of the British, American, and French occupation zones. This constitutional assembly must form a puppet government for West Germany, composed of elements among the Germans who are agreeable to the occupation authorities of the Western occupation zones, closely connected with US and British monopoly capital, but detached from the German people and hostile to their peaceful aspirations. This means that the US, Britain, and France concluded a secret agreement aimed at dividing and dismembering Germany politically and economically, and establishing such a separatist government in the Western occupation zones. This government is bound to oppose the legitimate demands of the German people for the unification and democratization of Germany. In addition to the aforementioned measures to achieve political division and dismemberment of Germany, the US, British, and French governments are now implementing new measures to divide and dismember Germany economically. The US, British, and French governments, immediately following the London Conference, began to implement the separate currency reform in the Western occupation zones of Germany, announced on June 18th, even though the aforementioned communiqué made no mention of the decisions on this issue at the London Conference. The Soviet Union had proposed implementing a unified currency reform for all of Germany based on a four-power agreement among the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. However, contrary to this obvious need, the US, British, and French governments implemented a separate currency reform in the Western occupation zones of Germany. Instead of implementing a unified currency system with a single mark for all of Germany, in accordance with the agreement previously established by the four-power governments and existing until now, the separate currency reform was implemented, and special marks were issued in West Germany. This created an economic barrier between West Germany and the rest of Germany, and created numerous new difficulties in eliminating economic disorder and restoring the German economy. The currency reform currently being implemented in the Western occupation zones of Germany aims to ensure profits for the big financial groups, primarily those German monopolists who maintain close ties with US and British monopoly capital. This promotes the increase of unemployment in West Germany, the deterioration of the material conditions of the working people, and will create new difficulties in economic relations with other countries. This is the inevitable consequence of the London Conference; the decisions of the London Conference will inevitably lead to the political and economic division and dismemberment of Germany.\n\n　　　　(2)\nThe policy of dividing and dismembering Germany obstructs the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Without a peace treaty with Germany, it is impossible to end the prolonged state of war (note: before the signing of a peace treaty, the original belligerent countries are still legally in a state of war) and the occupation regime in Europe. The London Conference communiqué made no mention of a peace treaty with Germany, nor did it mention the preparation for a peace treaty, which is not accidental. The decisions of the London Conference of the US, Britain, and France, with the participation of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, confirmed that the governments of these countries, as well as the German groups closely connected with them, are not interested in the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the early withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution of the entire German issue, the US, British, and French governments are preparing to promulgate so-called \"occupation statutes\" in the Western occupation zones of Germany, as deliberately hinted at in the London Conference communiqué. On the one hand, the interests of all peace loving nations require the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, which must abolish the occupation regime in German and fully restore the conditions for the peaceful and democratic development of the German people. On the other hand, the US, British, and French governments are unwilling to agree to the early conclusion of a peace treaty and are trying to impose their \"occupation statutes\" on the Western occupation zones of Germany in order to arbitrarily prolong the occupation of Germany for many years to come, placing the heavy burden of occupation expenses on the German people. This policy of the US, British, and French authorities, which leads to the enslavement of the German people and the delay in the peaceful resolution of the European issue, is incompatible with the task of transforming Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country, and also incompatible with the efforts of the people of all countries to establish a democratic peace in Europe as soon as possible.\n\n　　　　(3)\nThe decisions on the state institutions of the Western German occupation zones are filled with an anti-democratic spirit. All preparations for convening the so-called constitutional assembly and formulating the German constitution have fallen into the hands of the three military governors and the state premiers of the Western German occupation zones. Democratic parties, trade unions, and other democratic organizations representing the interests of the German people are completely excluded from this work. The interests of peace and security for the people of European countries require the abolition of the Hitler-style German centralism that destroyed the state parliaments and autonomous state governments. It requires the restoration of the non-centralized system before Hitler's rule, and requires the re-establishment of state parliaments and a bicameral parliament for all of Germany. As long as democratic organizations have the possibility of free activity, it can guarantee German unity and the transformation of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The decisions of the London Conference, however, have taken a completely different direction. Under the pretext of preventing the restoration of a centralized German empire, the London Conference, disregarding the development process of modern democratic countries, attempts to push Germany backwards, imposing a federal state on the German people. In this federal state, the main powers are given to the divided states, while the central government has only secondary functions. This plan of the US, Britain, and France aims to dismember Germany, thereby destroying an independent Germany. The implementation of this German federalization (dismemberment) plan makes the concept of German unity a tool for those who seek to restore Germany as a militaristic country that dominates the people of other countries. As a result, revanchism will rise, narrow patriotism will grow, and the environment for the emergence of a new Bismarck or even a new Hitler will be created. If the German people's desire for German unity once again becomes a tool in the hands of German narrow patriots and militarists (who have already received much encouragement from the occupation authorities of West Germany), this will inevitably lead to the recurrence of German aggression, causing extremely serious consequences for the people of European countries (including the German people); this will force peace-loving countries to intensify their struggle against the instigators of a new war.\n\n　　　　(4)\nThe policies pursued by the occupying powers in West Germany are encouraging German revisionists. These elements are conducting a movement against the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements on the demilitarization and denazification of Germany, the obligation of Germany to pay reparations for the losses caused by its aggression, and the well-known decision on the transfer of German residents, attempting to use these residents to achieve hostile aims against neighboring countries. The movement of German revisionist elements is particularly aimed at opposing the Polish-German border along the Oder and Neisse rivers, which is an unchangeable border—a border of peace. The London Conference avoided the issue of the revisionist movement, thereby encouraging the aggressive tendencies of the German reactionary groups. In such a situation, measures against all revisionist activities form one of the most important conditions for consolidating the peace and security of the people of European countries.\n\n　　　　(5)\nThe decisions of the London Conference of the US, Britain, and France subordinate the economy of West Germany to the intentions of the US and Britain, making it dependent on the implementation of the so-called \"European Marshall Plan.\" This means that the industry and other economic sectors of West Germany will be shackled by the monopolistic plans of American and British capitalism. They are striving to control the entire economic life of the West German occupation zones, without any concern for the genuine revival and development of German peaceful industry, and consider it to be their competitor. The purpose of this expansionist policy is to make the countries associated with the \"Marshall Plan\" even more dependent on American and British monopoly capital. The revival and development of German peaceful industry not only does not conflict with the interests of the people of other countries, but is also consistent with the work of European economic recovery. The German people should be given broad opportunities to restore and develop peaceful industry, agriculture, transportation, and foreign trade; otherwise, Germany cannot survive and cannot fulfill its obligation to pay reparations to the countries that suffered from German aggression. At the same time, four-power control should be preserved for some time to prevent the restoration of German military industry and German militarism. Including the economy of the West German occupation zones in the \"Marshall Plan\" means including this part of Germany in the division of the entire Europe into two camps being carried out under the \"Marshall Plan\": on the one hand, the camp of European countries that have adopted the \"Marshall Plan\" and therefore submit to American control; on the other hand, the camp of European countries that disagree with foreign interference in their internal affairs, including the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Thus, the London Conference not only completed the plan to divide and dismember Germany, but also further deepened the division of European countries into two opposing camps in accordance with the \"Marshall Plan.\" Obviously, this policy has nothing in common with the true interests of the people of European countries, nor with the economic recovery of Europe. The implementation of this policy by the US, Britain, and France will place the economy of the West German occupation zones in the difficult subordinate situation of the expansionist plans of foreign capital, which disregards the interests of democratic Germany.\n\n　　　　(6)\nThe London Conference passed special decisions on the Ruhr. The conference decided to establish a special agency to control the distribution of Ruhr coal, coke, and steel, composed of representatives from the countries participating in the London Conference. However, the control of this agency over the production of coal, coke, and steel has been lifted, which guarantees that American and British financial and industrial monopolists can maintain their dominance over Ruhr industry. Therefore, instead of transferring the Ruhr coal mines and metal trusts and cartels to the German people (which is what the Soviet Union and other participating countries in this conference firmly advocate), the US and British governments are actually taking over the entire heavy industry of the Ruhr into their own hands, not allowing France and the Soviet Union to participate in the control of production, nor allowing any German democratic organizations to intervene. This facilitates secret agreements between American and British monopolists (on the one hand) and the German Ruhr coal and steel tycoons (on the other hand), thereby creating the possibility of rebuilding Germany's war potential and establishing a foothold for new German aggression. It is not difficult to see that this policy is incompatible with the interests of peace and the interests of the German people and the people of European countries. Only by transferring the Ruhr heavy industry to the German people and determining that the production and distribution of Ruhr industrial products should be controlled by the four powers (Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France) for a certain period of time (the four powers together can guarantee that the Ruhr industry will only develop for peaceful purposes), can the possibility of solving the Ruhr issue from the perspective of the peace and security of the people of Europe be created.\n\n　　　　(7)\nAll of the above proves that the London decisions greatly violate the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements on German unity, demilitarization, denazification, and democratization, on destroying Germany's war potential and eradicating conditions that may promote new German aggression. In view of this, the London communiqué's claim that the London decisions will inevitably make it easier for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German issue in the future should be considered completely untenable. The untenability of this assertion is even obvious from the fact that the decisions of the London Conference completely contradict the decisions previously adopted at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences, and undermine the two agreements on the four-power control mechanism for Germany and the consideration of the German issue by the four-power foreign ministers' conference. The London separatist conference of the US, Britain, and France, with the participation of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and the London separatist decisions of these countries, cannot make it easier for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German issue, but can only undermine the trust of the people of all countries in international agreements involving the United States and Britain. It is not difficult to see that violations of international agreements cannot inspire people's trust in the countries that violate these agreements. In view of this, we refuse to recognize the legal effect or any moral authority of any decision of the London Conference.\n\n　　　　(8)\nIn accordance with the Yalta Conference and Potsdam Conference agreements on the German issue, the governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary believe that the following issues should be resolved first without any delay:\n\nOne: Implement measures to ensure the final demilitarization of Germany through an agreement between the four countries, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States.\n\nTwo: In order to develop the peaceful sectors of the Ruhr industry and prevent the reconstruction of Germany's war potential, determine that the four powers (Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States) will control the heavy industry of the Ruhr for a certain period of time.\n\nThree: Through an agreement between the four governments of Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and the United States, establish a democratic and peace-loving provisional government for all of Germany, composed of representatives from German democratic parties and groups, with the aim of creating a guarantee to prevent the resurgence of German aggression.\n\nFour: In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, conclude a peace treaty with Germany so that the occupying forces of all countries can withdraw from Germany within one year after the conclusion of the treaty.\n\nFive: Formulate measures for Germany to fulfill its obligation to pay reparations to the countries that suffered from German aggression.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华沙会议发表宣言  揭发伦敦会议决定旨在分裂德国提出由四强协议来解决德国问题\n\n1948-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华沙会议发表宣言\n    揭发伦敦会议决定旨在分裂德国提出由四强协议来解决德国问题\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯拉夫、南斯拉夫、波兰、罗马尼亚及匈牙利八国外长举行的华沙会议，二十四日发表宣言，严斥由美、英、法政府主持的，有比、荷、卢政府参加的对德问题伦敦会议的决定，揭发该决定旨在分裂德国，阻挠对德和约的缔结。抗拒德国非军国主义化与民主化，恢复德国的战争潜力，并使西德的经济从属于美英资本。该宣言并遵循雅尔塔与波茨顿协定的精神，提出由四强协议的途径来迅速解决德国问题的具体建议。除序言外，该宣言主文原文如下：\n    　　　　（一）\n    伦敦会议的决定，是直接走向分裂和瓦解德国的完成。美、英、法政府放弃了原先宣布过的对德国政治和经济统一的诺言之后，伦敦会议就准备以上述各国的分裂行动，建立一个自德国其他部分分裂出来的西德政府。为达此目的，就规定召开一特别挑选出来的，包括英、美、法占领区各州代表的立宪议会，而立宪议会必须组成一个西部德国的伪政府，由德国人中那些为西占区占领当局合意的，和美、英独占资本有密切联系、但脱离德国人民、并仇视其和平愿望的分子组成。这就是说，美、英、法缔结密约，目的在于分裂与肢解德国的政治和经济，并在西部占领区成立一个这样分裂的政府，这个政府必定反对德国人民对德国之统一和民主化的合法要求。除了上述实现政治上分裂和肢解德国的措施以外，美、英、法政府现在正在实行在经济上分裂和肢解德国的新措施。美、英、法政府在紧接着伦敦会议之后，就开始实行于六月十八日宣布的德国西部占领区单独的货币改革，尽管上述公报对伦敦会议上关于这个问题的决定只字未提。苏联曾建议在苏、美、英、法四国协议之基础上实行全德统一的货币改革。但是，和这个显然的需要相反，美、英、法政府在德国西占区实行了单独的货币改革。美、英、法政府不但不施行经四国政府从前确立的并一直存在到现在的协议，在全德发行统一马克的单一货币制度，反而单独实行货币改革，并在德国西部发行特种马克。这样就在德国西部和德国其他部分之间竖立了一道经济上的屏障，并且在消除经济紊乱和恢复德国经济方面制造了无数新的困难。德国西占区现在实行的货币改革，其目的在于保证大财阀，首先是那些与美英独占资本维持密切联系的德国独占资本家获利，这就促使西德失业的增长，劳动人民物质条件的恶化，并将造成和其他各国经济关系中的新的困难。这就是伦敦会议的不可避免的后果；伦敦会议的决定，必将导向德国政治和经济的分裂及肢解。\n    　　　　（二）\n    分裂和肢解德国的政策，阻挠了对德和约的缔结，而没有对德和约，就不可能结束拖延的战争状态（按：和约未签订前，原交战国双方在法律上仍处于战争状态中）和欧洲的占领政权。伦敦会议的公报没有只字提及对德和约，同样也没有提到和约准备的问题，这不是偶然的。有比、荷、卢参加的美、英、法伦敦会议的决定，证实了这些国家的政府以及和他们密切联系的德国集团，对及早缔结对德和约、及早自德国撤退占领军并不感兴趣。美、英、法政府不但不求整个德国问题的和平解决，反而准备在德国西占区颁布所谓“占领法规”，伦敦会议公报就故意含糊其辞的暗示了这一点。一方面，一切爱好和平民族的利益要求及早缔结对德和约，而缔结对德和约就必须取消在德国的占领政权，并充分恢复德国人民和平与民主发展的条件；另一方面，美、英、法政府却不愿答应早日缔结对德和约，并竭力将他们的“占领法规”强加于德国西占区，以便在今后很多年内专横地延长对德国的占领，把占领费的重荷压在德国人民头上。美、英、法当局这一导向奴役德国人民，并延岩欧洲问题和平解决的政策，是与使德国转变为爱好和平与民主国家的任务不符，也与各国人民要求尽速建立欧洲民主和平的努力不符的。\n    　　　　（三）\n    关于西德占领区国家机构的决定，充满了反民主的精神。召开所谓立宪议会和制订德国宪法的一切准备工作，都已落入西德占区三军事总督和各州总理的手中。民主党派与职工会以及代表德国人民利益的其他民主团体，完全被拒于这一工作之外。欧洲各国人民和平与安全的利益，要求取消摧毁州议会及州自治政府的希特勒式的德国中央集权制度，要求恢复希特勒执政前的非中央集权制度，并要求重设州议会及整个德国的两院制议会。只要民主团体获有自由活动的可能，就能保证德国统一及德国在和平与民主的基础上实行转变。伦敦会议的决定，却采取了截然不同的方向。伦敦会议以防止中央集权的德意志帝国的恢复为借口，不惜违反现代民主国家的发展过程，企图把德国倒推回去，以联邦国家强加于德国人民身上，在这联邦国家中，把主要的权力赋予分裂的各州，中央政府则仅有次要的职权。美、英、法这一计划，目的在于肢解德国，从而摧毁独立的德国。这一德国联邦化（肢解化）计划的执行，便使德国统一的观念，成为那些力求把德国恢复为统治其他各国人民的军国主义国家之人们的工具。其结果，报复主义将会抬头，狭隘爱国主义将会增长，新俾斯麦甚或新希特勒出现的环境将会产生。假如德国人民要求德国统一的愿望，再度成了德国狭隘爱国主义者及军国主义者（他们业已得到西德占领当局的许多鼓励）手中的工具，这便必然将导向德国侵略的重演，对欧洲各国人民（包括德国人民）造成极严重的后果；这将迫使爱好和平的各国人民不得不对新战争的煽动者加紧进行斗争。\n    　　　　（四）\n    西德各占领国所奉行的政策，正鼓励着德国修正主义分子。这些分子正进行着运动，反对雅尔塔会议与波茨顿会议关于德国民主化及非军国主义化、德国对其侵略所造成的损失应负的赔偿义务等各项问题的协定，反对人所共知的关于迁移德国居民的决定，并试图利用这些居民达到敌视邻国的目的。德国修正主义分子的运动，尤其在于反对沿奥得河与西尼斯河的波德疆界，而这是不可更动的疆界——和平的疆界。伦敦会议避开了修正主义运动的问题，因而鼓励了德国反动集团的侵略倾向。在这样的情况之下，反对一切修正主义活动的措施，便形成了巩固欧洲各国人民和平与安全最重要的条件之一。\n    　　　　（五）\n    美英法三国伦敦会议的决定，使西德的经济从属于美英的意图，使之依赖所谓“欧洲马歇尔计划”的执行。这意味着西德的工业及其他经济部门，将受美国以及英国资本主义独占计划的桎梏。它们正力求控制西德占区的整个经济生活，而决不关心德国和平工业真正的复兴与发展，并认为那是他们的竞争者。这一扩张政策的目的，在于使同“马歇尔计划”有联系的国家，更增加其对美英垄断资本的依赖性。德国和平工业的复兴与发展，不仅与其他各国人民的利益毫无抵触，并且与欧洲经济复兴的工作是相符合的。应该使德国人民获得广泛的机会，以恢复并发展和平工业、农业、运输及对外贸易；否则德国便不能生存，便不能对曾遭受德国侵略的国家尽其赔偿义务。同时，四强管制应该再予保存若干时期，以防止德国军事工业与德国军国主义的恢复。将西德占领区经济列入“马歇尔计划”。意味着将德国这一部分列入刻在“马歇尔计划”下进行的把整个欧洲切成两个阵营的划分中：一方面是那些采纳“马歇尔计划”、因而服从美国控制的欧洲国家的阵营；另一方面是那些不同意外国干涉本国内政的欧洲国家的阵营，苏联与各人民民主共和国也在其中。这样，伦敦会议不仅完成了分裂并肢解德国的计划，并且同时还根据“马歇尔计划”，进一步地加深着把欧洲国家切成两个对立阵营的划分。很明显地，这一政策与欧洲各国人民的真实利益，与欧洲经济复兴毫无相同之处。美英法这一政策的执行，将使西德占领区的经济处于外国资本的扩张计划之难堪的从属境况中，而外国资本是毫不考虑民主德国的利益的。\n    　　　　（六）\n    伦敦会议曾通过对鲁尔的特别决定。该会议已决定设立一个管制鲁尔煤、焦煤与钢之分配的专门机构，由参加伦敦会议各国的代表组成。而这一机构对煤、焦煤与钢的生产的管制权则已被撤销，这保证了美国及英国金融与工业垄断资本家得以保持其对鲁尔工业的统治。因此，不是将鲁尔煤矿与五金托辣斯及卡迭尔转归德国人民所占有（这是苏联以及本会议其他参与国所坚决主张的），而是美国及英国政府实际上把鲁尔的重工业全部掌握在自己手中，不让法国与苏联参加生产的管制，也不让任何德国民主团体过问，这就便利了美英垄断资本家（一方）与德国的鲁尔煤业及钢业大亨（另一方）之间的密约，从而创造了重建德国战争潜力及设立德国新侵略的立足点的可能性。不难看出：这种政策是与和平的利益、与德国人民和欧洲各国人民的利益绝不相容的。只有将鲁尔重工业转入德国人民之手，并确定在一定时间内由四强（苏、美、英、法）管制鲁尔工业出品的生产与分配（四强共同一起是能保证鲁尔工业只为和平目的而发展的），才会创造出从欧洲人民的和平与安全的利益来解决鲁尔问题的可能性。\n    　　　　（七）\n    上述一切均证明伦敦决定是大大违反关于德国统一、德国非军国主义化、非纳粹化及民主化，关于摧毁德国战争潜力及根绝可能促成德国新侵略之条件的雅尔塔与波茨顿诸协定。有鉴于此，伦敦公报所谓伦敦决定势必使四强今后在德国问题上易于达成协议云云，应认为是完全不足取的。这一断言之不足取，甚至从下述事实看来也是明显的，即伦敦会议的决定，完全与前此在雅尔塔及波茨顿会议上所通过的决定相抵触，而且破坏了关于四强对德管制机构以及由四强外长会议审议德国问题的这两项协定。有比、荷、卢参加的美、英、法三国伦敦分裂会议和这些国家的伦敦分裂决定，绝不能使四强易于达成对德问题的协议，只能破坏各国人民对美国及英国参加的国际协议的信任。不难看出：违反国际协议的行为，绝不能引起人们对那些违反这些协议的国家的信任。有鉴于此，我们拒绝承认伦敦会议任何决定在法律上的效力或任何道义上的权力。\n    　　　　（八）\n    遵照雅尔塔会议及波茨顿会议对德问题的协定，苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯拉夫、南斯拉夫、波兰、罗马尼亚及匈牙利政府认为，下列问题应首先予以解决而不容有任何稽延：\n    一、以英、苏、法、美四国协议的办法，履行确保德国最后非军国主义化的措施。\n    二、为发展鲁尔工业的和平部门及防止德国战争潜力之重建计，确定四强（英、苏、法、美）在一定时间管制鲁尔重工业。\n    三、以英、苏、法、美四国政府协议的办法，建立全德民主及爱好和平的临时政府，由德国民主政党及团体代表组成之，其目的在于创立一种防止德国侵略之重起的保证。\n    四、遵照波茨顿协议，缔结对德和约，俾使一切国家的占领军可以在和约缔结后一年内撤出德国。\n    五、制订德国履行对遭受德国侵略各国之赔偿义务的措施。"

The Jianghuai Military Region has jurisdiction over the area west of the Grand Canal, south of the Longhai Railway, and north of the Yangtze River, including parts of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which is also the area where the former New Fourth Army's Second, Fourth, and Seventh Divisions operated during the War of Resistance Against Japan, including all of eastern and western Huainan Road, all of eastern Huaibei Road, and part of the Wanjiang area. The entire area covers more than 90,000 square kilometers and has a population of 10 million. This liberated area was arduously created by the New Fourth Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Countless national heroes shed blood and sweat here, leaving behind many commendable and moving heroic deeds. General Peng Xuefeng, commander of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, gloriously sacrificed himself in 1944 in Yongcheng while fighting to save the anti-Japanese war situation in the Central Plains. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to seek national peace and unity, exercised restraint and ordered the New Fourth Army to withdraw from the Wanjiang area. In July 1946, the full-scale civil war broke out. Under the Kuomintang army's frenzied attacks, the Jianghuai area was once entirely occupied by the enemy, and the people were subjected to mass killings and arrests by the Kuomintang army. However, in less than half a year, that is, at the end of 1946, parts of the People's Liberation Army under Generals Chen Qingxian and Cao Diqiu successively marched into the Huaibei and Huainan areas, led by Generals Rao Zijian and Yang Xiaochun, respectively. After half a year of hard fighting, they smashed the Kuomintang army's plans for \"suppression,\" \"encirclement and suppression,\" and \"pursuit and suppression,\" and initially opened up the eastern Huaibei (Jinpu) Road area. In February 1947, General Yang Xiaochun again led his troops into eastern Huainan Jinpu Road, experiencing great hardships and opening up the Tianchang-Gaoyou area of Huainan. At the end of February this year, Generals Chen and Cao personally led a part of the East China Field Army into Huainan. By the time the Jianghuai Military Region was established, our army had recovered vast areas, liberated more than three million people, and established more than twenty county governments, and is gradually entering a new stage of full recovery.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 在与南京一江之隔地带　华东成立江淮军区  现已解放人口三百万建立廿多民主县政府\n\n1948-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　在与南京一江之隔地带\n    华东成立江淮军区\n    现已解放人口三百万建立廿多民主县政府\n    【新华社华东廿四日电】与南京仅有一江之隔的华东江淮军区，已于上月廿九日正式宣布成立华东人民解放军司令部为加强两地对敌斗争，迅速解放全江淮人民，特将淮南、淮北两军分区合并组成江淮军区；并任命陈庆先为司令员，饶子健、梁从学为副司令员，曹荻秋为政治委员，杨光池为副政治委员兼政治部主任，赵汇川为参谋长，张力雄为政治部副主任，江淮军区辖有运河以西，陇海路以南、长江以北之安徽省一部、江苏省一部，亦即在抗日战争时期原新四军二师、四师、七师所活动的淮南路东路西全部、淮北路东全部及皖江地区之一部。全区面积九万余方公里，人口一千万。该解放区原为新四军在抗日战争中所艰苦创建，无数民族英雄曾在此流血流汗，留下许多可歌可泣的丰功伟绩。新四军四师师长彭雪枫将军即于一九四四年为挽救中原抗日战局，奋战永城，而光荣殉国。一九四五年日本投降后，中共中央为求全国和平团结，实行忍让，令新四军撤出皖江地区。一九四六年七月全面内战爆发，在蒋军疯狂进攻下，江淮地区曾一时全陷敌手，人民横遭蒋军大量杀戮、逮捕。然为时不及半年，即一九四六年年底，陈庆先曹荻秋两将军所部解放军一部，即先后由饶子健、杨效椿两将军率领，分路挺进淮北、淮南地区，经半年苦战，粉碎蒋军“清剿”、“围剿”、“追剿”等计划，初步开辟了淮北（津浦）路东地区。一九四七年二月，杨效椿将军又率部挺进淮南津浦路东，历心艰苦，开辟了淮南天（长）、高（邮）地区。今年二月底，陈、曹两将军又亲率华东野战军一部进入淮南。至江淮军区成立时，我军已收复广大地区，解放人民三百余万，建立了二十余个县政权，并正逐渐步入全面恢复的新阶段。"

At the end of May, in preparation for large-scale grain grabbing, the enemy concentrated nearly eight battalions of troops in Xinxiang, including the entire 317th Regiment of the Chiang Bandit's 40th Division, two battalions of the 312th Regiment, a supply battalion directly under the division, and two companies of the 9th Artillery Regiment, and arrived in Huixian County. On the 12th, in conjunction with a local bandit unit, they began to invade the Huangshui Estuary area of Huixian County, covering and coercing a large number of laborers they had brought to grab grain. A unit of our certain troops immediately blocked them, killing and wounding more than 40 enemies. On the 16th, the enemy continued to invade Shimeng Estuary, and a certain unit launched a fierce counterattack, repelling seven enemy assaults in a row, preventing the enemy, which outnumbered us by one and a half times, from entering our inner lines. More than 400 enemies were killed and wounded, gloriously completing the task of protecting the grain. On the 18th, the enemy hastily retreated to Huixian County.\n    [Taihang News] A certain unit of our People's Liberation Army ambushed local bandits grabbing grain in Anyang, and won another victory, annihilating more than 100 enemies. At dawn on the 15th, Wang Zi's entire Third Battalion of bandits from Anyang departed from Liusi, passed through Xiaoyucun and Liangggongcun, and invaded Lijia Mountain. Our pre-ambushed troops launched a three-pronged attack on the enemy, wiping out most of the enemy in one hour of combat, capturing 73 enemies alive, killing more than 50 enemies including the company commander, and seizing five light and heavy machine guns, 57 rifles and carbines, and a batch of other military supplies. In this Lijiazhuang ambush, the bandits were extremely embarrassed. According to Jiang Bandit Tian Heizi, who was captured alive in this battle, \"If we don't set out, we starve, but if we do, we're finished.\" One day, the Third Battalion Commander summoned Wang Ning, the Bao chief, and asked him to deliver grain. The Bao chief said, \"If you don't set out, I won't dare to deliver it.\" The Battalion Commander said, \"Go back and urge the grain, I'll go tomorrow.\" Sure enough, he set out the next day, but when he arrived in Hanling, the Battalion Commander, who was carrying light and heavy machine guns and a lot of men, dared not go forward. He ordered the soldiers to attack Lijia Mountain. When they realized they were being ambushed by the People's Liberation Army, the rear was cut off, and the People's Liberation Army's shells hit the heavy machine guns accurately, the officers and soldiers panicked. Seeing the situation was bad, the Battalion Commander rode off in a rickshaw to escape. Two company commanders were killed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行五分区地方兵团　英勇护粮歼敌四百\n\n1948-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行五分区地方兵团\n    英勇护粮歼敌四百\n    【太行讯】我太行五分区地方兵团某部，在辉县黄水口、石门口两地阻击蒋匪大规模的重点抢粮进犯，歼敌四百四十余名。五月底，敌为准备大抢粮，集结于新乡的蒋匪四十师三一七团全部、三一二团两个营、师直属队一个辎重营、炮兵第九团两个连等将近八个营兵力，先后到达辉县城。十二日，结合土顽一部，开始进犯我辉县黄水口一带，掩护胁迫带来的大批民夫抢粮。我某部一部当即予以阻击，毙伤敌四十余名。十六日敌继续向我石门口进犯，某部展开猛烈反击，连续打退敌人七次冲锋，使一倍半于我之敌始终未能进入我内线。毙伤敌四百余人，光荣完成了保粮任务。十八日敌便慌忙撤回辉县城。\n    【太行讯】我解放军某部伏击安阳抢粮土顽，又获歼敌百余的胜利。十五日拂晓，安阳匪王自全部第三营从六寺出发，经小于屯、梁公村向李家山进犯。我预伏部队分三路夹攻敌人，战斗一点钟，将敌大部消灭，共活捉敌七十三名，毙敌连长以下五十多名，缴获轻重机枪五挺，步马枪五十七支，其他军用品一部。此次李家庄伏击战中，顽匪极为狼狈。据此役被我生俘的蒋匪田黑子谈：“不出发是饿得慌，一出发就完蛋。”一天，三营长将王宁保长找来叫送粮，保长说：“你们不出发俺不敢送”。营长说：“你回去催粮吧，我明天就去。”第二天果然出发来，赶到韩陵时，带着轻重机枪及好多人马的营长不敢前进了。他指挥当兵的向李家山进攻。当发觉遭受解放军埋伏时，后路已被打断，解放军炮弹打准了重机枪，官兵们慌作一团。营长看势不好，骑上洋车偷跑了。两个连长被打死。"

    "content": "Taihang District Party Committee Propaganda Department Instructs All Localities to Correctly Publicize the Party's Policies\n\n[Taihang News] The Propaganda Department of the Taihang District Party Committee issued instructions to the entire district on June 10 regarding propaganda work. It reviewed the \"leftist\" errors in the propaganda guidelines of the previous months and clearly put forward opinions on future propaganda work. It first pointed out that: In the Taihang District's implementation of the Land Law propaganda, the propaganda methods were creative, allowing the masses to understand the Party's policies and inspiring enthusiasm for production. However, due to underestimation of the foundation of land reform in the Taihang District (which was already quite thorough) and the organizational foundation (mainly impure work style), the propaganda content excessively emphasized shortcomings, one-sidedly emphasized the views of poor and hired peasants and absolute egalitarianism, causing some illusions among some Party members, cadres, and the masses, resulting in waste and a lack of enthusiasm for production. The instructions, on the one hand, pointed out from the perspective of guidelines and policies: This kind of one-sided, narrow poor peasant and absolute egalitarianism, reflecting the backward agricultural socialist ideology and the idea of excluding and attacking the old base, is a \"leftist\" deviation that violates the Party's policies and must be immediately corrected. On the other hand, it clearly stated that the Party's propaganda work in the future must correctly publicize and promote the implementation of the Party's policies. The instructions said: \"Our control of propaganda work should mainly focus on the correctness of guidelines and policies. Only propaganda work that expresses correct guidelines and policies can powerfully promote organizational work and improve the consciousness of the masses.\" In order to ensure the correctness of guidelines and policies in future propaganda work, the instructions pointed out that all localities must carefully study the guidelines and policies of the higher-level instructions, and no one is allowed to be creative when it comes to propaganda related to guidelines and policies. All creations must be strictly reviewed in accordance with the review system in order to be correct and perfect. Regarding future propaganda work, the instructions put forward three specific suggestions: 1. Correct various specific policies: production policies, the policy of consolidating and uniting with the middle peasants, the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, the rectification policy, the democratic construction policy, and the education policy; in the border areas, correct various specific policies for fighting the enemy; further promote the enthusiasm for production and the enthusiasm for fighting the enemy. 2. In order to promote the development of the large-scale production movement, the propaganda of the large-scale production movement must be launched immediately. The propaganda should emphasize that after feudalism has been eliminated, production should be developed and wealth should be created through labor; emphasize the combination of compensation for wrongly struggled middle peasants in the production movement, overcome the middle peasants' fear of struggle, fear of absolute equality, and unwillingness to develop, and establish the idea of building a family through labor and creating wealth through production; emphasize the voluntary, equivalent, and democratic organizational policies in production mutual aid organizations. In short, the Party's production policy should be clearly expressed in our propaganda work, the production enthusiasm of people of all strata should be improved, and the valuable experience of past production movements, especially the experience of labor heroes organizing production, should be promoted in order to quickly launch a large-scale production movement. 3. In terms of writing and creation, we should still create boldly in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies, but all creations must be reviewed by the propaganda department of the county party committee and approved by the propaganda department of the district party committee.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行区党委宣传部指示各地　正确宣传党的政策\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行区党委宣传部指示各地\n    正确宣传党的政策\n    【太行讯】太行区党委宣传部于六月十日向全区发出关于宣传工作的指示，对前几个月宣传方针上的左倾错误作了检查，明确提出对今后宣传工作的意见。首先指出：太行区在贯彻土地法宣传中，宣传方法上有创造，使群众了解党的政策，启发了生产积极性。但由于对太行区土改基础（已相当彻底）与组织基础（主要是作风不纯）估计不足，在宣传内容上过份强调了缺点，片面的强调了贫雇观点与绝对平均思想，引起部分党员干部群众一些错觉，因之浪费、不积极生产。该指示一方面从方针政策上指出：这种片面的狭隘的贫雇和绝对平均主义所反映的落后的农业社会主义思想及排斥与打击老基础思想是违反党的政策的左倾偏向，须立即加以纠正；一方面又明确的提出今后党的宣传工作必须是正确宣传与推动党的政策的贯彻。该指示说：“我们掌握宣传工作，主要应该着眼于方针与政策的正确。只有表现正确方针政策的宣传工作，才能有力的推动组织工作与提高群众觉悟”。为保证今后宣传工作中方针政策的端正，该指示指出各地以后必须很好研究上级指示的方针政策，凡有关方针政策的宣传，决不许自出心裁。一切创作，必须按照审查制度严格审查，以期正确完善。对今后宣传工作，该指示提出三点具体意见：一、端正各种具体政策：生产政策，巩固的联合中农政策，保护与发展工商业政策，整党政策，民主建设政策及教育政策；在边地，端正对敌斗争的各种具体政策；进一步发扬生产的积极性与对敌斗争的积极性。二、为推动开展大生产运动，必须立即展开大生产运动的宣传。宣传中应强调在封建已经消灭之后，应该发展生产，劳动致富；强调生产运动中结合补偿错斗中农，克服中农的“怕斗”、“怕绝对平”、不敢发展的思想，树立劳动发家、生产致富的思想；强调生产互助组织中的自愿、等价、民主的组织政策。总之，要从我们的宣传工作中明显地表现党的生产政策，提高各阶层人民的生产情绪，并发扬过去生产运动的宝贵经验，尤其是劳动英雄组织生产的经验，以迅速开展大规模的生产运动。三、在编写创作方面，仍应根据党的方针政策，大胆创造，但一切创作都必须经过县委宣传部审查，交地委宣传部批准。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 30th: During the Kaifeng campaign, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army strictly implemented city policies and observed discipline. The day before the battle began, the unit convened cadres at all levels to convey in detail the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Front Headquarters and Political Department regarding the protection of the city and the strict observance of city discipline. The day after entering Kaifeng's city walls, the unit and its divisions and regiments organized discipline inspection teams, with the director of the unit's political department and the minister of civil affairs personally serving as the captain and deputy captain of the inspection teams. During the five days and nights of fighting, political organs at all levels continuously conducted inspections and mobilizations. On the evening of the 15th, when the unit attacked the Agricultural College of Henan University, which had been set on fire by fleeing enemies, it immediately dispatched specialized troops to rescue buildings, books, and instruments. On the 18th, a part of the unit rested at the agricultural and forestry experimental farm. Although the soldiers had not eaten for a night, no one picked the ripe peaches and apricots in the orchard. On the 20th, after the unit occupied Zhongshan Street, Gulou Street, and other places through fierce street fighting, it deployed discipline inspection personnel everywhere and continued to carry out their tasks despite the frantic bombing by Chiang's planes. In front of all public buildings, cultural and educational institutions, and churches, signs were posted stating that our army strictly protects these institutions. When a group of poor citizens, who had been short of salt, rushed into a salt shop on Ziyou Road to take salt, the unit's discipline inspection personnel immediately went to dissuade them. The shop was extremely grateful and voluntarily sold a portion of its remaining salt at a low price, which satisfied both buyers and sellers. The unit immediately corrected any errors found during inspections. For example, when the unit's supply department mistakenly requisitioned 80 jin of wheat from the Yuxing Grain Shop, which was across from an enemy warehouse, it immediately compensated the shop after the mistake was discovered. Also, when a certain division searched for enemy supplies, it mistakenly confiscated some private belongings of the enemy officers' families. After investigation, it immediately sent special personnel to return the original items to their original owners. After the battle, the unit quickly carried out post-war rectification work to resolve incidents of damage to the interests of the masses that occurred during the war. The party committee of a certain unit also pointed out: \"If post-war work is not done well, it means that the city policies and discipline have not been done well.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开封我军执行城市政策  纪律严明满园桃杏无人摘食　轰炸声中抢救文物保护机关\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开封我军执行城市政策\n    纪律严明满园桃杏无人摘食\n    轰炸声中抢救文物保护机关\n    【新华社开封前线三十日电】解放军某部在开封战役中，严格执行城市政策与遵守纪律，战斗开始前一日，该部即召集各级干部，详细的传达了中共中央与前线司令部、政治部关于保护城市的各项政策及严格遵守城市纪律的指示。攻入开封城厢之次日，该部及各师、团则组织纠察队，并由该部政治部主任，民运部长亲任纠察队正副队长。在五昼夜战斗中，各级政治机关均不断进行检查与动员。十五日晚，该部攻进先被溃敌纵火焚烧之河南大学农学院时，立即派出专门部队，抢救房屋及图书仪器。十八日，该部一部曾在农林试验场休息，战士们虽已一夜未进饮食，但对满园已熟的桃杏却无人摘取。二十日，该部经激烈巷战占领中山街、鼓楼街等处后，即遍布纠察队员，虽在蒋机疯狂轰炸下，仍继续执行任务。各公共建筑物、各文化教育机关及教堂前均张贴我军严格保护此等机关的牌示。自由路某一盐店被一群已缺盐数目的贫苦市民涌入取盐，部队纠察人员即前往劝止；店方极为感激，自动廉价售出一部分存盐，故买卖双方均感满意。该部在检查中遇有错误即时纠正。如该部供给部误征敌军仓库对门之豫兴粮栈八十斤麦子，经发觉后立予偿还。又某师在搜查敌军物资时，曾误将敌军军官家属一部分私物没收，经查明后亦即派专人将原物归还原主。战斗结束后，该部迅即进行善后整顿工作，解决在战争过程中所发生损害群众利益的事件。某部党委并指出：“善后工作如未作好，就是城市政策和纪律没有做好。”"

    "content": "After Land Redistribution and Replenishment, Farmers' Production Enthusiasm is High\n    Zhao County Eliminates 80,000 Mu of Wasteland\n    [Report from this newspaper] A reporter from the North China General Branch, based on a report from the Hebei-Central Hebei District Party Committee to the North China Central Bureau, reported on the situation of wasteland elimination in Zhao County, Hebei-Central Hebei, stating: This spring, Zhao County had a total of 97,363 mu of wasteland, of which 82,025 mu have now been eliminated. More than 15,000 mu of wasteland remain. The District Party Committee analyzed the reasons for the wasteland in the report as fourfold: First, years of destruction and looting by enemies and bandits have led to continuous escapes from rural areas, resulting in the abandonment of some land, which has not yet fully recovered after liberation. Second, disasters are a factor. During the severe drought in 1943, the village of Tingzhutou had 900 mu of wasteland. It only rained in June of last year, resulting in one-third of the land in Tangjiazhai village (a total of 20 qing) being abandoned. Third, there is a large amount of unregistered land in rural areas, causing unfair burdens. Some villages have insufficient and unreasonable adjustments in war support and substitute farming, leading to a decrease in livestock, which affects farming. Fourth, after the anti-traitor liquidation and land reform/review struggles, farmers obtained land from landlords, but because Yuanshi and Shijiazhuang were not liberated last year and were very close to the enemy, some farmers who obtained land dared not cultivate it. The report stated: After this year's land redistribution and replenishment movement, farmers obtained livestock, farm tools, and movable property. In addition, with the liberation of Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi, farmers' enthusiasm for production is higher than it has been in more than a decade. The number of livestock is also increasing, with one small area in the third district increasing livestock by 129 head. Government loans and support have also played a significant role. 1.7 billion yuan (border currency) out of 2.2 billion yuan in loans had already been issued by early June. Farmers in the western small area of the sixth district obtained loans and added more than 100 head of livestock. Repeatedly clarifying the policy of not infringing on middle peasants and advocating getting rich also played a certain role in the land reclamation effort. The report also mentioned that landlords and rich peasants have a lot of wasteland. In seven villages in the second small area of the second district, there are 1,237 mu of wasteland, of which 960 mu are owned by landlords and rich peasants. The solution adopted at the county cadre conference for this situation was: lend livestock to those who have difficulties in cultivating the land, urge them to work, and force them to plant.\n\n    (Editor's note: Zhao County's achievements in eliminating wasteland are significant. However, how were the 80,000 mu of wasteland eliminated? The specific methods and complex organizational work have not been clearly explained. Another situation is worth noting, that is, according to the statistics of the second small area of the second district, 77 percent of the wasteland is owned by landlords and rich peasants. It is not known whether this situation can represent the general situation. Is this because landlords and rich peasants were allocated land but they are unwilling to plant, or because they were only allocated bad land? Or are there other reasons? Can the method of simply forcing planting solve the problem? Can it be guaranteed that the land will not be abandoned after planting? It is hoped that the responsible comrades in Zhao County can examine and report.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抽补后农民生产情绪高　赵县灭荒八万亩\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　抽补后农民生产情绪高\n    赵县灭荒八万亩\n    【本报讯】华北总分社记者依据冀中区党委给华北中央局的报告，报导冀中赵县消灭荒地的情况称：赵县今春共有荒地九万七千三百六十三亩，现已消灭八万二千零廿五亩。未消灭荒地尚有一万五千余亩。区党委在报告中分析荒地的原因有四：第一是历年来敌人、土匪破坏、抢掠，农村中不断有逃亡户外出，使得某些土地荒了，解放后尚未完全恢复。第二是灾荒原因。民国卅二年大旱灾，亭竹头一村，荒地达九百亩。去年六月才下雨，唐家寨一村因而荒地三分之一（共廿顷）。第三、农村中有大量黑地，造成负担不公，有些村庄战勤代耕等调剂不够合理，牲口因而减少，影响了种地。第四、反奸清算与土改、复查斗争后，农民从地主手中取得了土地，但因元氏石门去年尚未解放，距敌近在咫尺，有些得地农民不敢耕种。报告中称：经过今年的抽补运动，农民获得了牲口、农具、浮财，加以石门、元氏解放，农民生产情绪之高为十几年来所未有。牲口数目亦在添加中，三区一个小区增加牲口一百廿九头。政府贷款扶植，也起了不小的作用，二十二亿（边币、下同）贷款在六月初已贷下十七亿，六区西小区农民获得贷款，增添牲口一百多头。抽补中反复说明不侵犯中农政策并提倡发家致富，亦起了一定的作用。报告中还说到，地主富农的荒地很多，二区二小区七个村荒地一千二百三十七亩，其中地主富农荒地即占九百六十亩，县的干部大会上对于这种情况所采取的办法是：有困难的借给牲口耕地，督促劳动，强制他们种上。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    （编者按：赵县消灭荒地的成绩是很大的，但八万亩荒地如何消灭的？具体办法及复杂的组织工作都未交待明白，还有一个情况是值得注意的，即依据二区二小区的统计，荒地中有百分之七十七是地主富农的，这种情况不知是否能代表一般情况。这是因为给地主富农分了地他不愿种，还是因为只分了坏田？还是有其他原因？仅采取强制下种的办法是否能解决问题？是否能保证下种之后不再荒了？希望赵县负责同志能够检查报导。）"

    "content": "Branch Frequently Conducts Policy Education Inside and Outside the Party\n\tNorth Du's Production Enthusiasm is High\n　　[This Newspaper’s Report] Recently, this reporter passed through Gaoyi County and heard that the masses in Beidu Village in the Fourth District of the county had a very high production enthusiasm. Therefore, I made a special visit to the village and had talks with Comrade Wang, a district cadre, as well as village cadres, party members, mutual aid team leaders, and more than a dozen middle and poor peasants. After one day and two nights of individual interviews, small-scale discussions, and visits to homes, it was proven that the production enthusiasm of the masses in Beidu was indeed good. For example, during the five months of production and famine relief last winter and this spring, the village engaged in sideline production such as spinning, carrying burdens, burning lime, and moving stones (for house repairs and sales to other villages), earning a net profit of 13.59 million yuan (Jizhong Bank notes, same below), equivalent to 260 shi of millet. Currently, all 1,990 mu of autumn seedlings in the village have been weeded twice, and 305 mu of cotton have been weeded three times. Out of 1,000 mu of wheat stubble land, except for more than 400 mu of sandy land that is not suitable for autumn crops (due to water erosion), the rest has been planted, and some have been weeded once. This year, the village has added 13 large carts, bringing the total to 38. The above facts show that since Gaoyi County proposed democratic party consolidation and replenishment this spring, Beidu Village's production has been even more vigorous than during last year's production for self-salvation; the production enthusiasm of all strata is generally good. Many poor and middle peasants are not only actively engaged in production but have also begun to build houses. The two households building houses that I visited were Liang Huiyin and Liang Qingdan's mother. The latter is a peasant who has turned over and is rushing to repair the house because it is too small. The former is a middle peasant who lacked a place to put his cart and has been actively preparing materials this spring (just the lime requires three kilns), and will start construction after the busy season in the fields. It is said that there are four other middle peasant households building houses with them.\n    Why is Beidu Village able to actively produce? After talking with Comrade Wang, the district cadre, the village head, the chairman of the farmers' association, the production director, the cooperative head, and the branch secretary, as well as chatting with farmers such as Liang Huiyin and Liang Chunlan, I understood that this is the result of implementing the Party's policies:\n    First of all, the Party branch committee of Beidu uses the Party's policies as a weapon to conduct criticism and self-criticism, educate party members, strengthen internal party unity, and truly play the backbone role of branch party members. The Beidu Village branch was established and strengthened in the struggle against the Japanese. When the Japanese and puppet forces built a blockhouse in the west of the village (before 1944), they supported the masses in carrying out secret struggles in the form of \"autumn watching teams\" and \"secret guerrilla groups.\" When the War of Resistance Against Japan was won, they actively led the masses in anti-traitor liquidation and land reform to achieve liberation. Last year, during the great famine, branch party members and non-party cadres led the masses in production for self-salvation, enabling all 180 households and 770 people in the village to successfully overcome the serious famine, which was highly supported by the masses. This spring, before the county party committee convened a meeting of the main cadres of all villages in the county to mobilize for party consolidation, the secretary of the branch, the village head, the chairman of the farmers' association, the militia instructor, and the public security officer had fluctuations in their thinking due to insufficient understanding of the party consolidation policy, and production was once not very energetic. Soon after, the county party committee convened a meeting of main village cadres to mobilize for party consolidation, repeatedly explaining to everyone that party consolidation is to further combine the party with the masses, remove all obstacles that isolate the party from the masses, treat illnesses and save people, and improve all party members by an inch in Mao Zedong Thought. It called on everyone to correct mistakes if they have them, encourage those who have no mistakes, and lead production well in order to continue to gain mass support or make up for past mistakes in the production movement. Recalling history, comrades such as Liang Shuhai, the branch secretary, and Liang Guilin, the village head, remembered the pain of being a long-term worker in the past and how they were liberated when the Communist Party came, which awakened their class consciousness. First of all, they affirmed one point: \"Listening to the Party is never wrong, and lying down and doing nothing is not right!\" Returning to the village, they immediately convened a branch meeting to explain that party consolidation is to transform thinking and work style, not to struggle against party members and cadres. And at the second and third branch meetings (once every ten days), they read the Party newspaper and studied the various instructions of the higher party committee, focusing on this aspect because everyone was very concerned about party consolidation at that time. After the party members listened to the experience of Zhao Zhuang in the Ninth District of Wu'an in party consolidation and the branch secretary conveyed the situation of party consolidation in Xiliangzhuang, Gaoyi, they all said: \"Correct mistakes if you have them, return what you have gained too much, and work must be done actively!\" At the fourth and fifth branch meetings, they focused on discussing how to lead the masses in production. The enthusiasm for production has increased again.\n    At the same time, party members and cadres pay attention to publicizing the Party's policies, so that the policies become the masses' own things and they become active. Old men Liang Laotai and Liang Er'ou get up before dawn to collect manure and desperately apply it to the fields. Liang Laotai's wheat yielded an average of one dou more per mu than others this year, and he regrettedfully said: \"If the rain hadn't beat down on my mu of wheat, it would have yielded an extra bag (four dou)!\" There are two ways to publicize policies: one is individual talks; the other is reading the newspaper at night school. The reading group reads first, and then questions are raised for discussion and resolution. The masses have become interested in reading the newspaper, and now everyone is concerned about policies because it is inseparable from their lives; Even now, during the busy farming season, the three-day night school newspaper reading system is still maintained.\n    In the South and North Bridge villages in the same base area, a district cadre (Qi Xiao, an armed cadre of the Fourth District) suddenly came during the production period and convened a meeting. Regardless of right or wrong, he went on stage and announced: \"Those who have a cadre flavor have no right to speak, and all of them must go out!\" He kicked the old organization away, making the cadres pessimistic and the masses afraid. Those who were originally going to stand up also lay down, creating a chaotic situation. The work in Beidu Village is based on both the instructions of the higher authorities and the actual situation of the village, so it has not been affected by any external influences.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 支部经常进行党内外政策教育　北渎生产劲头大\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　支部经常进行党内外政策教育\n    北渎生产劲头大\n    【本报讯】日前记者路过高邑，听说该县四区北渎村群众生产情绪很高，乃专访该村，和区干部王同志及村干部、党员、互助组长、以及十多个中贫农晤谈，经过一天两夜的个别访问、小型座谈及上门探望结果，证明北渎群众生产情绪果真不错。例如：去冬今春五个月生产渡荒时，该村搞纺织、担挑、烧石灰、搬石头（修房用，销售外村）等副业生产，净赚红利一千三百五十九万元（冀钞，下同），折合小米二百六十石。现全村一九九○亩秋苗已锄二遍，三○五亩棉花已锄够三遍，一○○○亩麦茬地除四百多亩沙地不宜种秋庄稼（水冲）外，其余全按上苗，有的已锄过一遍。今年全村增加十三辆大车，连以前的共有三十八辆。以上的事实说明：今年春天高邑县提出民主整党抽补以来，北渎村生产比去年生产自救时干得还红；各阶层生产情绪普遍好。许多贫农、中农不仅积极生产，而且开始修建房屋，记者访问的两家修房户，一叫梁会银，一是梁青淡娘，后者是个翻身户，嫌房子狭小，正请人赶修；前者是个中农，因缺少个放车的地方，今年春天积极筹备材料（光石灰就得用三窑），待地里活忙过就动手修，据说和他们一起修房的还有四家中农。\n    为什么北渎村能积极生产？记者和区干部王同志、村长、农会主任、生产主任合作社长、支部书记交谈，又和梁会银、梁春兰等农民闲谈结果，明白了这是由于贯彻党的政策的结果：\n    首先，北渎党的支部委员会，他们是经常用党的政策作武器，进行批评与自我批评，教育党员，加强党内团结，真正发挥了支部党员的骨干党作用。北渎村的支部是在对日斗争中建设与壮大起来的，日伪在村西按炮楼时（一九四四年前），支持曾以“看秋队”、“秘密游击小组”等形式，领导群众进行秘密斗争。抗战胜利时，又积极领导群众反奸清算，进行土地改革闹翻身。去年大灾荒，支部党员和非党干部又带领群众生产自救，使全村一百八十户，七百七十口人，胜利渡过严重的灾荒，颇得群众拥护。今年春天，县委召集全县各村主要干部会，动员整党以前，由于对整党政策不够了解，支部书记、村长、农会主任、民兵指导员、公安员五个人思想都有波动，生产一度曾不起劲。不久县委召开主要村干会，动员整党，向大家一再说明：整党是使党与群众更进一步结合，去掉一切隔绝党与群众的障碍，是治病救人，使所有党员在毛泽东思想上提高一寸。号召大家有错改错，无错加勉，好好领导生产，以便在生产运动中继续取得群众拥护或将功补过。回忆历史时，支书梁书海、村长梁桂林等同志，想起过去当长工的痛苦，共产党来了才得到翻身的情形，唤醒了自己的阶级意识，首先肯定一点：“听党的话永没错，躺倒不干可不对！”回到村里，马上召集支部大会，说明整党是改造思想、改造作风，并不是斗争党员干部。并在第二、第三次支部大会（每十天一次）上朗读党报，研究上级党各种指示，当时大家对整党很关心，便着重念这方面的东西。党员听罢武安九区赵庄整党经验及支书传达高邑西良庄整党情况后，都说：“有错改错，多得要退，工作还要积极干！”第四、第五次支部大会，便着重讨论如何领导群众生产的问题。生产的劲头又大起来了。\n    同时，党员干部注意宣传党的政策，使政策成为群众自己的东西，积极起来。老汉梁老台、梁二偶天不明就起来拾粪拼命往地里上，梁老台的麦子今年每亩平均比别人多收一斗，他还很惋惜的说：“要不是雨拍着我那亩麦子，就得多打他一布袋（四斗）！”宣传政策的方式有两个：一是个别谈话；一是在夜校上读报，先由读报小组念，然后再提出问题讨论解决，群众对读报已发生兴趣，现在是人人关心政策，因为这和他们的生活分不开；直到现在农忙时，三天一夜校的读报制度仍保持着。\n    在同一基点内的南、北桥等村，生产期间突然来了个区干部（四区武装干事，名齐小），召开大会，不管是非轻重，上台就宣布说：“沾有干部味的，没有发言权，一律出去！”把旧组织一脚踢开，使干部悲观，群众害怕。原来要站起来的也躺倒了，造成一片混乱现象。而北渎村的工作是既从上级指示又从本村情况出发，所以未受什么外来的影响。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 27th: A front-line reporter in Kaifeng reports: Chiang Kai-shek bandits committed heinous and inhuman crimes in Kaifeng. Starting from the 18th of this month, the city was subjected to round-the-clock bombing by large numbers of American and Canadian-aided Chiang Kai-shek bombers. The enemy troops defending the city, before being annihilated, also engaged in frenzied arson, slaughter, and looting. A large number of buildings have been reduced to ashes, and it is currently impossible to fully count the casualties among the citizens. According to statistics from Tongji Hospital on Songmen Street alone, on the 22nd and 23rd, over 600 people were treated at the hospital for bomb-related injuries. The losses of lives and property of the people in Kaifeng due to this atrocity by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were unprecedentedly severe. Even the puppet legislators from Henan Province in Nanjing had to submit a petition to the puppet Executive Yuan President, Weng Wenhao, \"urging Weng to order government planes to stop bombing Kaifeng city to protect civilians\" (Associated Press). The puppet Legislative Yuan also resolved that \"blind bombing of cities should be avoided in the future\" (United Press). This shows how profound the crime of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in destroying peaceful residents was, and what a huge responsibility the American government, which actively aids Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and continuously supplies him with instruments of murder, should share for this crime.\n\nPrior to this battle, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits forcibly occupied scenic spots and historical sites inside and outside the city, such as the ancient Dragon Pavilion, Drum Tower, Yuwangtai, as well as Henan University school buildings, and the South Gate Post Office, to construct fortifications. On the 18th, before the enemy at the South Gate was defeated and fled into the city, they burned down the agricultural college of Henan University and the flour company, among other buildings, and the fire raged for three days. Before the enemy at Caoguan fled into the city, they also poured kerosene on houses and set them on fire. American-supplied Chiang Kai-shek planes also dropped incendiary bombs at the South Gate, and over a thousand civilian houses were reduced to ashes. The known number of dead and injured residents exceeds sixty. On the 19th, when the People's Liberation Army entered the city from the South Gate, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' artillery fire was still concentrated on bombarding the South Gate. American-supplied Chiang Kai-shek planes again dropped incendiary bombs. Shops on South Gate Street, the Refugee New Village, and the Gospel Hall buildings were partially destroyed, and charred corpses were visible everywhere. The enemy trapped inside the city, whenever facing unfavorable combat situations, would set fires or have Chiang Kai-shek planes drop incendiary bombs, attempting to use this to impede the PLA's offensive. The most prosperous Zhongshan Street, Madao Street, and Drum Tower Street in the entire city were all set on fire. The South Wu Printing House, China-West Pharmacy, and China Industrial Enterprise Society buildings were mostly destroyed by fire. The routed enemy, under the pretext of requisitioning boxes and other items to build fortifications, entered homes, ransacked boxes and cabinets. On Drum Tower Street alone, dozens of businesses, including the Chinese Christian Baptist Hongen Church, Sino-American Optical Company, Wufu Sauce Garden, and Jintai Hotel, were looted. Chiang Kai-shek bandits, who occupied Kaifeng Women's Normal School as a position, looted all the school's clothing before fleeing, and then set the buildings on fire. Teachers and students of the school hiding in the basement almost all perished. Teachers and students of Ji Bian Middle School were locked in a room; they were not allowed to seek shelter during the Chiang Kai-shek plane bombings, resulting in dozens of casualties. Chiang Kai-shek bandits relied on the Nationalist Party provincial government buildings for combat, and at night, in order to provide lighting by setting fires, the nearby Kaifeng Women's Normal School, Broadcasting Station, Sanyou Industrial Society, and others were all engulfed, with flames soaring into the sky. Even after ground combat had ended, bombing and strafing by American-supplied Chiang Kai-shek planes continued for days. Chiang Kai-shek bandits declared they would bomb Kaifeng to the ground to avenge their defeat. Although the PLA troops entering the city exerted all their efforts, with great self-sacrifice, to assist people from all walks of life in Kaifeng in rescuing refugees and maintaining order, it was still difficult to offset the immense losses caused by this mad act of destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The tragedy of the beautiful ancient capital of Kaifeng proves that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang cannot resist the PLA's offensive and is only fighting the people, fighting peaceful residents who have no weapons. The crime of destroying Kaifeng will be forever remembered by the people of Henan and the people of China. Blood debts must be repaid, and the murderers who created the blood debts will surely have a day when they are judged and severely punished.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美丽古都惨遭浩劫　蒋匪轰炸焚掠开封  屠杀同胞的凶手将来必予审判严办\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美丽古都惨遭浩劫\n    蒋匪轰炸焚掠开封\n    屠杀同胞的凶手将来必予审判严办\n    【新华社开封前线二十七日电】开封前线记者报导：蒋匪在开封制造了灭绝人性的血腥罪行。从本月十八日起，该城即被美国及加拿大援助蒋介石的大批轰炸机日夜轮番轰炸，被歼前的城内守敌亦疯狂纵火屠杀抢劫，大批建筑已被付之一炬，市民伤亡者刻尚无法作完全统计。仅据宋门大街同济医院二十二、二十三两天统计，因被炸前往该院疗伤者即达六百余人。此次蒋匪对开封之暴行，人民生命财产损失空前惨重，甚至连在南京的河南省伪立委们，也不得不向伪行政院长翁文灏呈递请愿书，“敦促翁氏下令政府飞机停止轰炸开封城，以保护平民”（美联社）。而伪立法院也决议“将来应避免盲目轰炸城市”（合众社）。由此可见，此次蒋介石匪帮毁灭和平居民的罪恶是如何深重，而积极援助蒋介石内战、不断供给以杀人利器的美国政府，对于这种罪恶亦应分担何等巨大的责任。\n    此次战役前，蒋匪则强占城内外名胜古迹如古龙亭、鼓楼、禹王台等地及河南大学校舍、南关邮政局等处构筑工事。十八日南关敌败逃入城前，焚毁了河南大学农学院及面粉公司等建筑物，大火三日不熄。曹关敌逃入城内前，亦用煤油浇屋放火。美国供给的蒋机复在南关投掷燃烧弹，千余间民房均化为灰烬，居民死伤已知者有六十余人。十九日，解放军自南关攻入城内，蒋匪炮火仍集中轰击南关。美国供给的蒋机又投掷燃烧弹。南关大街商店、难民新村、福音堂楼房等处都被烧毁一部，焦头烂额之尸体到处可见。困守城内之敌，每遇作战不利，即行放火或由蒋机投掷燃烧弹，图以此阻遏解放军进攻。全城最繁华之中山街、马道街、鼓楼街均被纵火。南务印书馆、中西大药房、中国工业实业社建筑大都已遭焚毁。溃散之敌借口征用箱物构筑工事，登堂入室，翻箱倒柜，仅鼓楼街即有中国基督教浸礼会鸿恩堂、中美眼镜公司、五福酱园、金台旅社等数十家遭抢劫。强占开封女师作阵地之蒋匪于败逃时抢劫全校衣物后，又点火烧屋，藏身地下室的该校师生几全遭难。济汴中学师生则被关于屋内；蒋机轰炸时仍不准躲避，致伤亡数十人。蒋匪凭借国民党省府建筑作战，夜间为了放火照明，附近之开封女师，广播电台、三友实业社等均遭蔓延，火光冲天。在地面战斗结束后，美国供给的蒋机之轰炸扫射仍连日不停。蒋匪宣称将炸平开封以雪败战之恨。入城的解放军虽竭尽全力，以极大的自我牺牲精神协同开封各界人士救助难民，维护秩序，但仍难于抵消蒋匪此种疯狂毁灭行为所造成的浩大损失。美丽的古都开封的惨剧，证明蒋介石匪帮不能抵抗解放军的攻势，而只是向人民作战，向手无寸铁的和平居民作战。破坏开封的罪行，将为河南人民和中国人民所永远记住。血债必须偿还，制造血债的凶手必有被审判严办的一天。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Taiyue News] Yangcheng Jiangli Village has reorganized its mutual aid teams in conjunction with correction of deviations, disaster relief, and weeding, gaining some experience: First, establish an organization to lead production and thoroughly rectify mutual aid teams: 1. An expanded production committee was established in the village, composed of the village head, instructor, chairman of the farmers' association, director of the armed forces committee, chairman of the women's association, manager of the cooperative, and experienced farmers and mutual aid team leaders, totaling a dozen people, to specifically lead production. Any teams that were forcibly organized last year, with forcibly assigned team leaders that the masses were dissatisfied with, were announced as freely withdrawing or dissolving after a team member meeting. 2. To facilitate sideline production, various small-scale mutual aid and cooperative organizations are freely formed, establishing a method of regular combination of agricultural and sideline industries in terms of organization and technology. 3. The masses deliberate and elect team leaders, taking the ability to organize mass production and mass support as conditions, and fully promote a democratic leadership style. 4. Each mutual aid team develops a production plan, reasonably evaluates work and determines points, formulates mutual aid rules, and promotes the role of \"organizing to replace machines.\" 5. In order to prevent too many meetings from affecting mass production, village cadres strengthen production leadership and participate in each team's labor exchange weeding separately, combining work and production. The entire administrative village voluntarily and democratically combined into fifty-two small groups according to the above principles. Out of the village's six hundred households, only nineteen households did not participate in the mutual aid team. There are two reasons why these nineteen households did not participate: 1. Several households used to take advantage in the team and were not harmonious, and some did not implement equivalent exchange when they were team leaders, so no one wanted them this time. 2. Some households do not have labor, and others are unwilling to combine with them. The production committee is now studying how to solve the problems of these nineteen households. Second, the implementation of agricultural and sideline mutual aid production has improved everyone's enthusiasm for production and mutual assistance. According to a survey of the Tumeng Natural Village, there are the following three forms of combination of agricultural and sideline industries: 1. Jointly borrow money and hire a dedicated transporter. The transporter receives wages and food, and dividends are distributed according to shares. The mutual aid team weeds for the transporter, and the transporter pays the mutual aid team for agricultural production labor. 2. Coal mine workers go to the kiln to mine coal, and farmers weed for them and receive agricultural wages. The mutual aid team weeds for the carpenters in the group who work outside, and working for a day is 500 Jiao less than the carpenter earns outside. The carpenter eats outside, and the weeders eat their own food. In the past month or so, this combination of agricultural and sideline production has achieved great results. The masses of the three natural villages earned a total of 5 million yuan from rushing to work, going down to the coal mines, and engaging in various handicrafts including transportation, which can buy 140 dan of grain (the village lacks 70 dan of grain during the spring famine). Many people have returned the wages that were unpaid or underpaid to middle peasants, implementing the policy of correcting deviations and uniting production, making everyone feel the benefits of mutual assistance in production. Third, actively weed according to the two major principles of voluntariness and equivalent value. In terms of equivalent exchange, it is stipulated that: 1. If a household using labor lacks labor but has grain, and the worker is a household suffering from the spring famine, then rice will be returned in exchange for labor to help solve the spring famine. 2. If the household using labor has no grain and the other party is not a household suffering from the spring famine, then labor will be returned for weeding, so that the other party can squeeze out labor to engage in other sideline production. 3. If the household using labor has labor but no grain, and the other party has both labor and grain, with the consent of both parties, a labor slip can be issued to the worker, and labor can be allocated at any time to eliminate the difficulties of the labor-owing household and can be used to dispose of surplus labor. 4. If the household using labor lacks both grain and labor, and the other party has labor but no grain, in order to solve the other party's difficulties, they can first go to transport after weeding their own seedlings, and the mutual aid team will help with the remaining autumn seedlings, and wait for him to return labor later. The above four methods have been widely used by the masses. Everyone is voluntary and of equivalent value, activities are convenient, and they do not worry about each other. The enthusiasm for production has been improved, and most of the village's grain fields have been weeded within nine days, truly achieving \"weeding one inch for the grain.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阳城匠礼村结合锄苗整顿互助　自由结合小型组织\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阳城匠礼村结合锄苗整顿互助\n    自由结合小型组织\n    【太岳讯】阳城匠礼村结合纠偏、救灾、锄苗等工作，重新整顿了互助组，取得若干经验：第一、树立领导生产的机构，彻底整顿互助组：一、在村里建立了扩大的生产委员会，由村长、指导员、农会主席、武委会主任、妇女会主席、合作社经理和富有生产经验的农民、互助组长共十数人组成，专门领导生产。凡是去年强迫编制，强迫指定组长而为群众不满意的，经过组员会议，宣布自由退出或解散。二、为便利进行副业生产，自由结合各种各样小型互助合作组织，从组织上技术上确立农副业经常结合的办法。三、群众酝酿民选组长，以组织群众生产的能力和群众拥护为条件，充分发扬民主领导作风。四、各互助组定出生产计划，合理评工定分，制定互助规矩，发扬“组织起来顶机器”的作用。五、为了防止开会太多，影响群众生产，村干部加强生产领导，分头参加各组变工锄苗，使工作和生产结合起来。全行政村根据上述原则自愿民主结合成五十二个小组，全村六百户人家，只十九户没有参加互助组。这十九户没参加的原因有两种：一、有几户过去在组里净占便宜，又不和气，有的当组长时不执行等价交换，这次结合没人要他。二、有些户没有劳力，别人不愿和他们结合，现在生产委员会正研究解决这十九户的问题。第二、施行农副业互助生产，提高了大家生产互助的情绪。根据土孟自然村调查，农副业结合的形式，共有以下三种：一、合伙贷款专人运输，运输人得工资伙食，红利按股分红，互助组给运输人锄苗，运输人向互助组付农业生产工资。二、煤窑工人到窑上挖煤，农民给他锄苗，得农业工资。互助组给本组在外的木匠工人锄苗，劳动一天比木匠在外少赚冀钞五百元，木匠吃在外边，锄苗者吃自己。月余来这种农副业的结合生产，获得很大成绩。三个自然村群众打忙工，下煤窑，进行各种手工业连同运输共赚五百万元，可买一百四十石粮食（该村春荒缺粮七十石）。许多人把进去未付或少付错斗中农的工资都还了，贯彻了纠偏和团结生产的方针，使大家在生产上感到了互助的好处。第三、按照自愿、等价两大原则主动锄苗。在等价交换方面，规定：一、使用劳力的户如果有粮食缺劳力，出工者为春荒户，就按工还米，帮助解决春荒。二、使用劳力户无粮食，而对方不是春荒户的，即还工锄苗，使对方能挤出劳力从事其他副业生产。三、使用劳力户有劳力无粮食，而对方劳力粮食均不缺乏，在双方同意下，可给出工户开付工条，随时拨工，以免除欠工户的困难，并可借以处理余工。四、使用劳力户粮食劳力两缺，而对方有劳力无粮食者，为了解决对方的困难，他在锄完自己的谷苗就可先去运输，其余秋苗由互助组帮助锄，等他以后回来还工。以上四种办法，已为群众普遍运用，大家自愿等价，活动方便，互不牵挂，生产劲头提高了，九天之内全村谷地大部锄完，真正做到了“谷锄一寸”。"

    "content": "Malayan People Resist British Persecution\n    Several British Officials Killed in Mass Riots\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] According to a TASS dispatch from Delhi on the 19th, citing Indian newspaper reports: A mass movement against British oppressive policies and ethnic discrimination has occurred in Malaya. Several British colonial officials, rubber plantation owners, speculators, and usurers were killed in the riots. The center of the struggle is in northern Malaya. The Delhi newspaper \"The Statesman\" pointed out: The political situation in Malaya is \"unquestionably serious.\"\n    The occurrence of this Malayan incident is a reaction to the British ruling authorities' adoption of economic plundering and anti-communist, anti-democratic persecution policies. Since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the British authorities in Malaya have adopted various policies in the economic field, such as levying income taxes, freezing wages, purchasing farmers' rice at low prices, monopolizing tin and rubber trade, and controlling foreign trade. In politics, Britain implemented the so-called \"Malayan New Deal\"; held illegal elections in Singapore; prohibited gatherings on this year's May Day; and provoked Malays to exclude Chinese, wooed Indians, appeased upper-class overseas Chinese, and colluded with Chiang Kai-shek government secret agents to attack progressive forces among overseas Chinese and other reactionary measures.\n    Various sources indicate that after the Malayan incident occurred, the British colonial authorities, under the pretext of a so-called \"communist rebellion conspiracy,\" successively adopted various methods of suppression. Moreover, British sources fabricated that the Chinese Communist Party participated in the Malayan incident, the purpose of which was obviously to find an excuse for the British ruling authorities to further suppress the movement of all ethnic groups in Malaya to strive for liberation. On the 10th of this month, the British authorities in Malaya arrested Liu Yifan, the representative of the Malayan Communist Party in Kuala Lumpur and manager of the MCP's organ, the Min Sheng Bao, and on the 16th, the Min Sheng Bao was closed down. At the same time, the authorities also disbanded the Malayan Federation of Trade Unions (note: the association is a pillar of the Malayan democratic movement, with 450,000 members last year, and joined the World Federation of Trade Unions in September 1946), and arrested an Indian leader of the Ipoh Rubber Industry Workers' Union. On the 16th, the British High Commissioner in Malaya, Gurney, announced martial law in three regions of Johor and one region of Perak. On the 17th, the martial law was extended to all nine states of the \"Malay Federation.\" The martial law granted the military police so-called \"special emergency powers,\" including the power to impose the death penalty, arrest, detain, and expel those arrested from the relevant areas, prohibit gatherings, search persons and houses, cut off land and water transportation, and requisition buildings and vehicles. On the 21st, the British authorities launched a large-scale arrest throughout Malaya. The Associated Press reported that more than 300 people were arrested, including 113 in Selangor, 60 in Perak, 50 in Johor, 30 in Negeri Sembilan, and 60 in Penang and Wellesley Province. The MCP headquarters in Kuala Lumpur and several of its branches, several offices of the New Democratic Youth League, the Malayan Veterans Association, and several trade unions were also searched by the police. On the 23rd, the so-called \"emergency measures\" were further extended to Singapore City, where the headquarters of the New Democratic Youth League and the Singapore Trade Union were also searched, and six people were arrested in the city.\n    TASS, citing news from the Telegraph Agency, stated that after the Malayan incident occurred, many British Labour Party members of parliament were shocked by the suppression. TASS also stated that there is sufficient evidence to show that neither the feudal elements of Malaya nor the right-wing nationalists of Burma can suppress the people who demand social and economic liberation, who demand to get rid of the enslavement of the British and other foreign monopolists who hold most of the rich resources in Southeast Asia, and who seek true independence.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马来亚人民反英迫害　若干英籍官员在群众暴动中被击毙\n\n1948-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马来亚人民反英迫害\n    若干英籍官员在群众暴动中被击毙\n    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据塔斯社十九日德里电引印度报纸消息称：马来亚发生反抗英国压迫政策及民族歧视的群众运动。若干英籍殖民地官员、树胶园主、投机商及高利贷者在暴动中被击毙。斗争中心在马来亚北部。德里报纸“政论家”指出：马来亚政治情形“毫无问题的严重。”\n    此次马来亚事件的发生，系英国统治当局采取经济掠夺及反共反民主的迫害政策的反响。抗日战争结束以来，马来亚英当局在经济上采取了征收所得税、冻结工资、低价收买农民米粮，垄断锡、树胶贸易，统制对外贸易的各种政策。在政治上，英国实施了所谓“马来亚新政制”；举行新加坡的非法选举；禁止今年五一节的集会；并挑拨马来人排斥华人，拉拢印人，怀柔华侨上层分子，勾结蒋政府特务分子打击华侨进步力量等反动措施。\n    各方消息指出：当马来亚事件发生之后，英国殖民当局以所谓“共产党叛乱阴谋”为借口，接连采取了各种各样的镇压办法。不仅如此，英国方面的消息，更捏造中国共产党参与此次马来亚事件，其目的显然为英国统治当局进一步镇压马来亚各民族争取解放的运动寻找借口。本月十日，马来亚英国当局逮捕了马来亚共产党驻吉隆坡代表兼马共机关报民声报经理刘一帆，十六日复将民声报查封。与此同时，当局又解散了马来亚工会联合会（按该会系马来亚民主运动的支柱，去年拥有会员四十五万，于一九四六年九月加入世界职工联盟），并拘捕了怡保胶业工人工会的印籍领袖。十六日，英驻马来亚高级专员金德宣布，在柔佛州的三个地区和霹雳州的一个地区戒严。十七日，戒严令复被扩及于“马来联邦”全境的九个州。戒严令授予军警以所谓“特别紧急权力”。包括可以判处死刑、逮捕、拘留及自有关区域放逐被捕者，禁止集会，搜查人身及房屋，断绝水陆交通及征用建筑物与舟车等。二十一日，英国当局更在马来亚全境发动了大搜捕。美联社称，被捕者达三百人以上，计雪兰峨州逮捕一一三人，霹雳州逮捕六十人，柔佛州逮捕五十人，森美兰州逮捕三十人，槟榔屿及威士利州逮捕六十人。吉隆坡马共总部及其若干分部，新民主青年同盟若干办事处，马来亚退伍军人协会及若干工会亦俱被警察搜查。二十三日，所谓“紧急措施”更扩及于新加坡市，该地之新民主青年同盟总部及新加坡职工会亦被搜查，全市并有六人被捕。\n    塔斯社引电报通讯社消息称：马来亚事件发生之后，许多英国工党议员对此次镇压行动甚为震惊。塔斯社并称，有足够的证据说明，不论是马来亚的封建分子，或是缅甸的右冀民族主义人士，对于那些要求社会及经济解放、要求摆脱在东南亚握有大部富源地区的英国及其他外国垄断家奴役而取得真正独立的人民，是压制不了的。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Malaya is located in the southwest of our country and is a British colony. According to statistics at the end of June 1941, the total population was 5.5 million, of which overseas Chinese accounted for approximately 2.4 million. After enduring more than 160 years of enslavement under British imperialism, and especially after more than three years of anti-Japanese war, their national consciousness has been greatly enhanced.\n\n　　When the Japanese invaders invaded the south and the British army was defeated and surrendered, the people of Malaya fought bravely for national liberation and made great contributions to the war of resistance against Japan. However, more than a month after the Japanese surrender, the British army returned to Malaya and not only failed to meet the demands of the Malayan people for freedom and liberation, but forcibly disarmed the \"Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army\" led by the Malayan Communist Party, which had persisted in fighting the enemy for three years. They also successively arrested anti-Japanese elements and their leaders, and announced the restoration of all pre-war reactionary laws, including deportation orders and sedition laws. Lord Mountbatten, Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, openly supported the military police in maintaining so-called \"public order\" in February 1946 and prohibited freedom of assembly. The three major policies adopted by the Malayan authorities—unconditionally banning Japanese military currency, buying rubber at low prices, and controlling trade—caused a large number of business bankruptcies, as well as serious unemployment, poverty, and bankruptcy. All these reactionary measures aroused the Malayan people's struggle for work, bread, and democratic rights.\n\n　　In October 1945, Singapore first saw a major strike by 9,000 dockworkers and 2,000 public utility workers, opposing low wages and opposing military assistance to the Netherlands to suppress the Indonesian liberation movement. Subsequently, strikes, market boycotts, and demonstrations demanding work and bread spread throughout central and northern Malaya. In January 1946, the authorities arrested Wang Jingguang, chairman of the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army, unreasonably searched the headquarters of the General Federation of Labor in Senai, and shot and killed assembled masses. This further triggered a violent strike of 190,000 people in Singapore and a market strike of 95% of the shops in Malaya, paralyzing transportation and public institutions. In March of the same year, there was another all-Malaya strike of 500,000 people protesting the arrest of Song Guang, a leader of the People's Anti-Japanese Army.\n\n　　In order to ease the resistance of the Malayan people, British imperialism announced the so-called \"Malayan Federation\" plan at the end of 1946 (also known as the \"Malayan New Deal,\" which began to be implemented on February 1 this year). The \"New Deal\" stipulates that Singapore and the Malay Peninsula should be divided into two administrative regions. Singapore is directly ruled by a governor appointed by the United Kingdom, while the Malay Peninsula organizes a nominal \"Malay Federation,\" with each state \"independent,\" but in reality, the British High Commissioner to the \"Malay Federation\" manipulates it from within, holding military and political power. The \"New Deal\" stipulates that the \"Malayan Federation\" will establish a so-called \"Legislative Council\" composed of British colonial officials and pro-British elements in Malaya, and promulgate so-called \"citizenship rights\" aimed at dividing and provoking unity among the various ethnic groups in Malaya (with particularly harsh restrictions on overseas Chinese obtaining \"citizenship rights\"). This so-called \"New Deal\" fundamentally did not change Malaya's colonial status. This new deception, aimed at continuing to maintain British enslavement rule in Malaya, was opposed by the Malayan people. The Pan-Malayan Political Organizations Joint Action Committee, led by the Malayan Communist Party and with 440,000 members, united people from all ethnic groups and strata in Malaya to launch a movement against the Malayan Federation plan in July last year, and drafted the \"People's Constitution.\" In October, there was another general strike of 100,000 people across Malaya against the \"Malayan Federation Plan.\" In January of this year, the Pan-Malayan Political Organizations Joint Action Committee announced a boycott of the Malayan Federation Legislative Council. When the United Kingdom officially established the Malayan Federation and implemented the \"New Deal\" on February 1, the Singapore General Federation of Labor launched a protest strike by 30,000 workers. Offices of various left-wing political parties in Malaya flew flags at half-mast to express their protest. The Malayan Democratic Front also held mass rallies to expose the British political conspiracy to establish the Malayan Federation and sent a telegram to the British government demanding the immediate abolition of the \"New Deal.\" Since the general strike of transportation and dock workers in Singapore in April, the Malayan people have been continuously waging heroic struggles against oppression and hunger.\n\n　　Wu Tianwang (transliteration), one of the leaders of the Malayan Communist Party, pointed out at the conference of representatives of communist parties from British territories held in London last March that the strength of the Malayan Communist Party, the savior of the Malayan people, \"has increased fivefold.\" He said, \"The Malayan people have fully recognized the new tricks of imperialism and will continue to fight for democratic representative system, freedom, and peace, and will never give up until they achieve their goals.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马来亚的民主运动\n\n1948-07-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马来亚的民主运动\n    【新华社陕北廿九日电】马来亚位于我国西南部，是英国的殖民地。据一九四一年六月末统计，共有人口五百五十万，其中华侨约占二百四十万人，在备尝英帝国主义一百六十余年来奴役统治之后，特别是经过三年多抗日战争的锻炼之后，他们的民族觉悟已大为提高。\n    马来亚人民在日寇南侵，英军败北投降之后，为了民族的解放，曾进行了英勇的战斗，对抗日战争极有贡献。但是日寇投降后的一个多月，英军回到了马来亚，不仅没有让马来亚人民达到自由解放的要求，反而以暴力将马共领导的坚持三年对敌斗争的“马来亚人民抗日军”强行缴械，并相继逮捕抗日分子及其领袖，宣布恢复战前一切反动法令，包括驱逐令、煽动法令等。东南亚盟军统帅蒙特巴顿于一九四六年二月公然支持军警维持所谓“公共秩序”，并禁止集会自由。马来亚当局所采取无条件的禁用日本军用票、低价收买树胶、及统制贸易的三大政策，造成商界的大批倒闭，以及严重的失业贫穷与破产。这一切反动措施，激起马来亚人民要求工作、面包和民主权利的斗争。\n    一九四五年十月，新加坡首先爆发九千名码头工人与二千名公共事业工人的大罢工，反对低微工资，反对予荷兰军事援助以镇压印尼的解放运动。接着，要求工作与面包的罢工、罢市与示威请愿运动，遍及马来亚的中部与北部。一九四六年正月间，当局逮捕马来亚人民抗日军主席王锦光，无理搜查仙奈总工会会址，并枪杀集会群众，更激起了新加坡十九万人的抗暴大罢工和马来亚百分之九十五的商店的罢市，使运输交通及公共机关均陷于瘫痪状态。同年三月，又发生抗议民抗军领袖宋光被捕事件的全马来亚五十万人的大罢工。\n    为了缓和马来亚人民的反抗，英帝国主义于一九四六年底公布了所谓“马来亚联邦”计划（或称“马来亚新政制”，已于今年二月一日开始实行）。“新政制”规定划新加坡与马来半岛为两国行政区。新加坡由英国委派总督直接统治，马来半岛则组织名义上的“马来联邦”，各邦“独立”，而实际上则由英国驻“马来亚联邦”之高级专员从中操纵，掌管军政大权。“新政制”规定“马来亚联邦”成立由英国殖民地官员与马来亚亲英分子凑合的所谓“立法议会”，并颁布以分化和挑拨马来亚各民族团结为目的的所谓“公民权”（对华侨获得“公民权”限制特别苛刻）。这种所谓“新政制”根本没有改变马来亚的殖民地地位。这一旨在继续维护英国在马来亚奴役统治的新欺骗，遭到马来亚人民的反对。以马共领导的全马民主阵线为主体，拥有四十四万会员的泛马来亚政团联合行动委员会，曾联合马来亚各民族各阶层人士，于去年七月间发起反马来亚联邦计划的运动，并起草了“人民宪草”。十月间又发生全马十万人反对“马来亚联邦计划”的总罢业。今年正月间泛马来亚政团联合行动委员会宣布抵制马来亚联邦立法议会。当二月一日英国正式成立马来亚联邦及实施“新政制”时，新加坡总工会发动了三万名工人的抗议大罢工。马来亚各左冀政党办公处下半旗致哀，表示抗议，马来亚民主阵线亦举行群众大会，揭露英国成立马来亚联邦的政治阴谋，并致电英政府，要求立即废止“新政制”。自四月间新加坡交通与码头工人的总罢工发生以来，马来亚人民一直不断地为反压迫和反饥饿进行着英勇的斗争。\n    马共领袖之一的伍天旺（译音），去年三月在伦敦召开的英帝国各属领共产党代表大会上指出：马来亚人民的救星——马共的力量，“已经增长了五倍”，他说：“马来亚人民已充分认识到帝国主义的新计策，并将继续为民主代议制、自由与和平而斗争，不达目的决不罢休”。"

    "content": "[Ji-Lu-Yu News] With the imminent arrival of the Yellow River flood season, the Yellow River Committee has recently made emergency arrangements for flood prevention work. It was pointed out that the general spirit of this year's flood prevention is to defend key areas in phases and sections, overcoming last year's general formalism. Flood prevention must be closely integrated with production to ensure a reasonable labor burden. Each county and section must achieve unified leadership and joint responsibility. The county head must take the lead personally and not relax for a moment, to effectively complete the important task of ensuring that the Yellow River embankment does not breach. The county head and section chief of the area where negligence occurs and an accident happens will bear full responsibility. Regarding the organization of flood prevention, it is stipulated that county and district levels will set up command headquarters, and a key command point will be set up every ten li in key sections, with adjustments made as appropriate depending on special circumstances. Each key point will have a warning bell. A flood prevention hut will be set up every 500 meters in key sections, and a flood prevention hut will be set up every 1,000 meters in ordinary work sections. Each hut will be equipped with a copper gong and fifteen kinds of tools and materials for emergency rescue and embankment protection. Usually, each hut will have a flood prevention worker, with shifts changing once a month. When the water reaches about one meter from the embankment, the number of workers will increase to seven, and when the water rises further, it will increase to ten, with shifts changing about every five days. Villages within ten li of the river will be flood prevention areas. Villages within five li will mainly use self-defense forces to organize emergency rescue and embankment protection teams. Team members will usually engage in production at home, but they must prepare tools and materials for emergency rescue, such as grass bundles, cloth bags, hoes, and baskets. In case of danger, a bell or gong will be used as a warning signal. When the gong is sounded, the rescue teams within five li of the river must immediately go to the embankment for rescue and protection, and when the bell is sounded, all able-bodied men within ten li must immediately go to the embankment for rescue and protection.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黄河大汛即将到来我黄委会紧急布防\n\n1948-07-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黄河大汛即将到来我黄委会紧急布防\n    【冀鲁豫讯】黄河大汛即将到来，我黄委会于日前紧急布置防汛工作。指出今年防汛，总的精神是分期分段，重点防守，克服去年一般化的形式主义作法。防汛要和生产密切结合起来，确实做到劳力负担的合理。各县和段必须做到领导统一、共同负责。县长要亲自带头，一时一刻也不能放松，切实完成确保临黄不准开口的重大任务。何处疏忽失事，何处的县长、段长要负完全责任。关于防汛的组织，规定县、区级设指挥部，重点段每十华里设一重点指挥点，特殊情形可酌情增减，每个重点设一警钟。重点段每五百公尺设一防汛屋，平工段每千公尺设一防汛屋。每屋备铜锣一面，和十五种抢险护堤的工具工料。平时每屋设一防汛员，每月换班一次。水至大堤一公尺左右时增至七人，水再大时，增至十人，五天左右换班一次。沿河十里内的村庄为防汛区。五里内的村庄以自卫队为主，组织抢险护堤队。队员平时在家生产，但须准备好抢险的草捆、布袋、铣、筐等工具工料。出险时以敲钟鸣锣为警号，敲锣时沿河五里内的抢护队立即上堤抢护，敲钟时十里内的壮丁都要立即上堤抢护。"

    "content": "[Hebei Central News] After the land reform, liberated peasants in various parts of central Hebei have been actively purchasing and breeding livestock, and acquiring a large number of farm tools. In the past six months, statistics from the 9th and 11th districts, and six counties of the 8th district, show that farmers have obtained government loans and pooled private funds to purchase 10,568 head of various livestock. The 8th and 9th districts have bred 265 head of livestock. Zhao County alone purchased 1,123 head of livestock from April to May. In Raoyang, 86 villages purchased 660 head of livestock, an average increase of 7 head per village. Li County organized the purchase of 1,047 head through recovered wealth and private funds. Peasants in Beizhang Village, Anguo County, used their spare time from farming to transport goods with their share of fruits and livestock, earning over 11 million yuan (border currency), and bought another 13 head; now, an average of one head of livestock is owned by every three households in the village. Many households that previously did not have livestock now have animals to use. The peasants are very happy to have acquired livestock and are paying close attention to feeding them. Farmers in Beianzhuang Village, Shen County, democratically formed groups to jointly raise livestock, and the Production Committee established a Cattle Department to specifically lead the farmers in feeding the livestock, keeping them very strong. In the ten townships of Cheng Guan, Hejian County, most of the masses relied on small merchants for a living and lacked experience in raising livestock. The township established a Livestock Cooperative, hiring several experienced livestock raisers to specialize in feeding, overcoming the difficulties of joint livestock raising where the animals were only used but not fed properly or where people did not know how to feed them. In order to solve the problem of farm tool shortages, peasants in various places have been actively purchasing them in large quantities. Seven counties, including Shen County, Gaocheng, and Anguo, have acquired over 30,400 pieces of various farm tools such as hoes, ploughshares, and plows, and repaired and purchased 645 waterwheels. Anguo County alone bought over 2,400 hoes and 2,840 ploughshares and plows. The production promotion agencies in many counties have established farm tool factories, selling them to farmers at cost price with loans. The iron factory opened by the Gaocheng Promotion Agency produced a total of 360 waterwheels, over 10,000 buckets, and 200 iron pots in five months. Wuji opened a farm tool factory and two waterwheel manufacturing plants, producing 60 waterwheels and over 3,000 waterwheel buckets, all sold to the peasants at low prices.\n　　[Shijiazhuang News] Since April 1st, the eight districts in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City have issued agricultural loans, totaling 28,802,000 yuan (border currency) to date. Among the twelve villages in the district, a total of 3,164 households received loans, accounting for 39.5 percent of all households. Poor peasants accounted for 85 percent of the total loan recipients, and middle peasants accounted for 15 percent. Farmers used the government loans and their own pooled 7,112,500 yuan to purchase 119 heads of livestock, 353,622 catties of soybean cakes and dried manure and other fertilizers, which can fertilize 1,130 mu of land. At the same time, they also dug and repaired six new wells, repaired 84 waterwheels, and bought 254 pieces of farm tools such as well pulleys and willow cans, solving the production difficulties of many farmers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中各地翻身农民大量添购牲畜农具\n\n1948-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中各地翻身农民大量添购牲畜农具\n    【冀中讯】冀中各地翻身农民，在土改后纷纷购买与繁殖牲畜，大量添置农具。半年来，九、十一分区及八分区六个县的统计，农民获得政府贷款，并凑集私资购买各种牲畜一万零五百六十八头。八、九分区繁殖了牲畜二百六十五头。赵县一县从四月到五月，即添购牲畜一千一百二十三头。饶阳八十六个村，购买牲口六百六十头，平均每村增加七头。蠡县组织浮财、私资添购一千零四十七头。安国北章村农民利用农闲，以分得的果实牲畜拉脚，赚洋一千一百余万元（边币，下同），又买了十三头；现该村平均三家就有一头牲口。过去许多没牲口的户，现在都有牲口使了。农民添了牲畜，非常高兴，加意喂养。深县北安庄农民民主结组伙养牲口，生产委员会下设立了耕牛部，专门领导农民喂养，把牲口养的很健壮。河间城关十乡，大部群众依靠小商贩为生，没有喂牲口的经验，该乡成立了个牲畜合作社，找了几个喂牲口有经验的人专门饲养，克服了伙养牲口光使不喂和不会喂的困难。各地农民为了解决农具缺乏的困难，纷纷大量购置。深县、藁城、安国等七县添置锄、铧、犁等各种农具三万零四百余件，修理和添购水车六百四十五辆。安国一县即买锄二千四百余张，铧、犁二千八百四十件。好多县的生产推进社设立了农具制造厂，按原价贷卖给农民。藁城推进社开办的铁工厂，五个月共制水车三百六十架，斗子一万多个，铁锅二百口。无极开办了农具厂和两个水车制造厂，制造了水车六十多辆，水车斗子三千多个，都低价卖给了农民。\n    【石家庄讯】石家庄市郊八区自四月一日开始发放农业贷款，迄今共贷出二万八千八百零二万元（边币，下同），全区十二个村共三千一百六十四户，贷款户占百分之三十九点五。其中贫农贷款户占总贷户百分之八十五，中农占百分之十五。农民们利用政府贷款和自己凑集的七千一百一十二万五千元，增购牲口一百十九头，豆饼、干粪等肥料三十五万三千六百二十二斤，能上地一千一百三十亩。同时并新凿和修理水井六眼，修水车八十四辆，买辘辘、柳罐等农具二百五十四件，解决了许多农民生产的困难。"

    "title": "Peking Over 400 Professors Send Letter to Stuart, Sternly Condemning the U.S. for Supporting Japan: The Chinese People Have the Strength to Defeat Any Foreign Oppression",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-03",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Four hundred and thirty-seven professors and lecturers from various universities in Peking jointly sent a letter to U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, on June 8th, sternly refuting Stuart's statement made on June 4th. Among the declarations repeatedly issued by Peking professors in recent years, this is the one with the largest number of signatories. The full text of the letter, as published in the Tianjin Daily on June 13th, is as follows:\n\nMr. Stuart,\n\nThe facts are evident that your government has violated the Potsdam Agreement and has done everything possible to support Japanese militarism. Yet you preposterously claimed: \"I don't think anyone can present any evidence that any part of Japan's military strength is now being restored.\" Facts in the world cannot be hidden by lies. As the U.S. Ambassador, you should be more aware than us of your government's conspiracies and actions, yet you resort to such lies and deception. Wouldn't this \"damage\" your \"position and reputation\"? To dispel your smokescreen, we hereby briefly describe the facts of your government's malicious support for Japan and its restoration of militarism as follows:\n\n(1) In terms of the Army: Allowing its police force to expand from 61,000 in 1932 to 300,000, equivalent to the total number of its pre-war regular army and police. Also, allowing it to \"train special emergency forces\" is equivalent to training a regular army.\n\n(2) In terms of the Navy: Returning 28 ships, including destroyers and submarines, and allowing it to establish a \"Maritime Safety Agency.\" This agency commands 38 patrol ships, and will later expand to 135, and it is even allowed to possess 100 minesweepers. Its largest naval ports, Sasebo, Yokosuka, and Kure, have not only not been dismantled but are being actively expanded with American equipment.\n\n(3) In terms of the Air Force: Retaining its airfields and air defense facilities in various locations, as well as 45 Nakajima aircraft factories, further adding a \"strong air force base\" in Aomori Zenguan, and transporting former Kamikaze pilots to the United States for training.\n\n(4) In terms of Politics: Retaining the war criminal Emperor, condoning war criminals such as Tojo, Doihara, Matsui Iwane, etc., releasing fascist leaders such as Army General Masaki Jinzaburo, former Taiwan Governor Navy General Kobayashi Seizo, and aircraft tycoon Nakajima Chikuhei and other dozens of major criminals; commanders of the China Expeditionary Army, Okamura Neiji, Commander of the China Sea Fleet, Hasegawa Kiyoshi and other thousands of war criminals have not been arrested and brought to justice. It also strongly encourages their past acts of harming overseas Chinese and oppressing Koreans, and vigorously suppresses the rise of the people's power, hoping that all the Japanese people will forever be mired in feudal fascist tyranny.\n\n(5) In terms of Economy: Allowing it to increase annual steel production to 8.5 million tons, retaining 4 million tons of merchant ships, an annual shipbuilding capacity of 400,000 tons, and restoring spindles to 10 million, while all hydroelectric and thermal power are preserved. Other industries such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and soda ash all exceed the 1935 level. The above are all directly or indirectly related to military industries.\n\nThe above are just a few prominent examples; other support measures are too numerous to mention. In the face of such facts, can you still assert that \"no one can present any evidence that the United States has any agreement other than that Japan's military power will never rise again\"? You stated: \"The basis of Japanese aggression lies in its imperial territories outside its homeland.\" This kind of upside-down cause-and-effect fallacy is extremely foolish. May I ask, if there is no prior aggression, where does the \"imperial territory outside the homeland\" come from? After Japan restores its situation before the \"July 7th\" Incident, it can invade externally at any time. China and Japan are so close to each other. Can we \"rest assured\" as you said? Your government is using \"anti-communism\" and \"anti-Soviet\" to support Japanese militarism, allowing it to make a comeback. Before World War II, Japanese warlords and German and Italian fascists also used the excuse of \"anti-communism\" and \"anti-Soviet\" to develop industry and expand armaments. However, were the first to suffer communism and the Soviet Union, or China and Western European countries? This is only the current historical lesson, how can you be so forgetful?\n\nJapan's economy must be \"restored\" to the \"extent that it can be self-sufficient,\" and we certainly agree with this. However, your government allows it to \"restore\" to the 1935 level, which far exceeds the \"extent that it can be self-sufficient\" and can be used for large-scale aggression. Can you \"deny\" its threat to China? If you want to improve the living standards of the Japanese people and enable them to have sufficient food and clothing, you should implement land reform and a rational distribution system in Japan, and not use China as a colony to supply raw materials and sell commodities.\n\nYou have always claimed to \"help improve the happiness of Chinese students.\" However, your written statement on June 4th insulted and threatened the anti-support-Japan movement of Chinese students, making the Chinese people understand your true face. Thinking for you, this is really unwise. Your government's actions to support Japan are directly related to the survival of our nation and world peace. Therefore, the opposition of Chinese students represents the interests of all Chinese people, and their voices represent the voices of the Chinese people. Your slanderous accusations of \"voluntarily being used\" and \"other conspiracies\" are truly out of character. Is it that the Chinese people must all bow their heads and obey your government's support of Japanese militarism and the carving up of China in order to obtain the \"reputation\" of not being \"used\"? You have \"spent most of your life in Chinese academic circles,\" yet you are so blind and ignorant of the real situation in China. We deeply sigh for you. You defend your government's wrong policies, forcefully argue, and conceal the facts, causing the Chinese people to hate you deeply. During World War II, your country fought alongside China for the common interests of both countries, defeating the common enemy of both countries. How ridiculous is it that your government lords over the Chinese people in the posture of a benefactor? After Japan's surrender, your government claimed to \"assist China in its tragic circumstances,\" but the Chinese people have not received your government's \"assistance.\" On the contrary, precisely because your government interfered in China's internal affairs and maliciously \"assisted,\" it has prolonged and expanded the Chinese civil war, causing the Chinese people to suffer greatly. \"You must be prepared to bear the consequences of your actions.\" The Chinese students, intellectuals, and all the people do not care about this unreasonable threat, because your government's aggressive claws have already reached into China, and we have already learned from it. We firmly believe that the strength of the Chinese people is enough to defeat any foreign interference and oppression. We firmly believe that the vast majority of good people in your country must also stand on the same front with the Chinese people to defeat your government's reactionary policies. If your government does not immediately change its government's policy of continuing to support Japanese militarism, we should tell you in your own words: Your government \"must be prepared to bear the consequences of its actions\"!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北平四百余教授致函司徒　严斥美国扶植日本  中国人民有力量击溃任何外来压迫\n\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北平四百余教授致函司徒\n    严斥美国扶植日本\n    中国人民有力量击溃任何外来压迫\n    【新华社陕北二日电】北平各大学教授讲师四百三十七人曾于六月八日联名致函美国驻华大使司徒雷登，对司徒六月四日发表的声明，予以严正驳斥。在北平教授近年迭次发表的宣言中，这是署名人数最多的一次。据六月十三日津报所载该函全文如下：\n    司徒雷登先生大鉴：贵国政府违反波茨顿协议，极尽扶植日本军国主义之能事，事实昭昭在目，而阁下竟妄谓：“余以为无任何人能提出日本军力之任何部分现正予以恢复之证据。”天地间之事实决非谎言所可隐藏，阁下身为美国大使，较吾人当更洞悉贵国政府之阴谋行动，然竟如此撒谎欺骗，岂不“损害”阁下之“地位与名誉”？兹为消除阁下之烟幕，特将贵国政府恶意扶植日本，恢复军国主义之事实略述如后：\n    （一）陆军方面：允其警察由一九三二年之六万一千名扩充为三十万名，等于其战前常备陆军及警察之总数。又允其“训练特别非常部队”，等于训练正规陆军。\n    （二）海军方面：交还驱逐、潜水等舰二十八艘，允其设立“海上保安厅”。统辖巡视舰三十八艘，以后扩充至一百三十五艘，更允其拥有扫雷艇一百艘。其最大军港佐世保、横须贺及吴港非特未予拆除，且正按美国设备，积极扩充。\n    （三）空军方面：保留其各地飞机场与防空设备，以及中岛飞机制造厂四十五所，更于青森增关“强大空军基地”，复运往日之神风队飞行员赴美训练。\n    （四）政治方面：保留战争罪魁天皇，姑息战争要犯东条、土肥原、松井石根等，释放法西斯领袖陆军大将真崎堪三郎、前台湾总督海军大将小林跻造及飞机大王中岛知久平等要犯数十名，侵华陆军总司令冈村宁次、侵华海军总司令长谷川清及其他万千战犯即迄未逮捕法办。对其历次伤害华侨及压迫韩人之行为更极力怂恿，对其人民势力之抬头更极力箝制，务希全日人民永远沉沦于封建法西斯苛政之下。\n    （五）经济方面：允其提高钢铁年产量至八百五十万吨，保留商船四百万吨，每年造船能力四十万吨，纺锭则恢复至一千万枚，水电、火电则全部保存。其他如硫酸、硝酸、灰碱等工业则皆超过一九三五年水准。以上皆直接或间接属于军需工业。\n    上列数端仅为荦荦大者，其他种种扶植措施尚不及备举。面对此种事实，阁下尚可断言“无任何人能提出美国有使日本军力永不再起以外任何同意之证据”乎？阁下有云：“日本侵略之基础系在其本土以外之帝国统治地”，此种因果倒置之谬论，至为愚蠢；试问如不先行侵略，“本土以外之帝国统治地”由何而来？日本恢复“七七”事变前夕之景况后，自可随时对外侵略，中国与日近在咫尺，则吾人尚可如阁下所云“尽可安心”乎？贵国政府借“反共”、“反苏”以扶植日本军国主义，使其东山再起。第二次世界大战前日本军阀与德、意法西斯亦借口“反共”，“反苏”以发展工业，扩充军备，然首遭其殃者果为共产主义与苏联乎，抑为中国与西欧各国乎？此仅为目前之历史教训，阁下何健忘至此？\n    日本之经济须“恢复”至“能以自给之程度”，吾人固极赞同，然贵国政府允其“恢复”至一九三五年水准，是则远超“能以自给之程度”，而可大肆侵略矣。其对中国之威胁阁下竟可“余否认之”耶？如欲提高日本生活水准，使其护得丰衣足食，自应在日本国内实行土地改革及合理之分配制度，而不得以中国为供应原料与推销商品之殖民地也。\n    阁下素以“协助增进中国学生之幸福”自居，然阁下六月四日之书面声明对中国学生之反扶日运与予以侮辱与威胁，使中国人民洞察阁下之真面目，为阁下思之，实属不智。贵国政府扶日之举直接攸关我民族之存亡与世界之和平，故中国学生之反对，实代表全中国人民之利益，其呼声实代表中国人民之呼声。阁下信口雌黄，诬为“自愿被利用”及“其他阴谋”实乃大失体态。岂中国人民人人府首听从贵国政府扶植日本军国主义宰割中国，即可获得不“被利用”之“名誉”乎？阁下“一生之大部分时间消磨于中国学术界中”，而竟对中国实情如此盲昧无知，吾人深为阁下叹息。阁下为贵国政府之错误政策辩护，强辞夺理，掩饰事实，使中国人民痛恨不置。第二次大战期间，贵国与中国并肩作战，乃为两国之共同利益，击败两国之共同敌人。贵国政府如以恩人之姿态君临中国人民，岂不可笑？日本投降后，贵国政府自命“协助陷于悲惨环境中之中国”，然中国人民并未获得贵国政府之“协助”与此相反，正因贵国政府干涉中国内政，恶意“协助”，已使中国内战拖延扩大，已使中国人民生灵涂炭。“诸君必须准备承受行动之结果”。阁下此种无理威胁。中国学生与知识分子以及全体人民绝不介意，盖贵国政府之侵略魔爪早已伸入中国，吾人已领教有素矣。吾人深信中国人民之力量足以击溃任何外来之干涉与压迫，吾人深信贵国绝大多数善良人民亦必与中国人民立于一条战线上，击溃贵国政府之反动政策。贵国政府若不立即改变其继续扶植日本军国主义之政府，吾人当以阁下之言转告阁下，曰：贵国政府“必须准备承受行动之结果”！"

The Chiang Kai-shek troops, who had only occupied Zhangqiu and Longshan for a few days, fled west upon hearing the news. We immediately recovered the aforementioned areas and pursued the fleeing enemy. On the morning of the 24th, we completely routed the Chiang Kai-shek 73rd Division (15th and 77th Brigades), the 2nd Division's 213th Brigade, and security regiments that had gathered in Hancang, Wudian, Shilipu, Yushan, He'erzhuang, Zao Yuansi, Caojiapu, Fangjia Zhuang, Lüjia, and other places (all located 25 to 45 li east of Jinan). All of the aforementioned areas were captured by our army, and the remnants of the enemy fled towards Wangsherenzhuang and the areas west of it. Currently, our army's vanguard has directly approached the eastern suburbs of Jinan, an area 20 li away. According to preliminary statistics, over 1,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and 330 were captured alive. The spoils of war included one 60mm mortar, 28 light machine guns, 5 submachine guns, and 300 rifles and pistols.\n\nAlso, it has now been confirmed that among the prisoners captured during our capture of Zou County on the 15th of last month are Ge Ao, Deputy Commander of the 3rd Security Brigade of Shandong Province and Commander of the Zou County Defense, and Yu Yanling, a regimental commander with the rank of colonel, of the 2nd Regiment of the brigade, as well as many other enemy officers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China Front, 2nd: The Mencius Temple and Mencius Mansion in Zou County have been almost completely destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Meng Zhaozeng, the 72nd generation descendant of Mencius, specifically accused Chiang Kai-shek's troops of their destructive crimes to the People's Liberation Army protecting the Mencius Temple on the day after the liberation of Zou County (June 16). According to him, after the Japanese surrender, Gong Zhenhuan, the Kuomintang County Magistrate of Zou County (who was killed by us in this battle), under the pretext of obstructing city defenses, ordered the complete demolition of Mencius' Mother's Former Residence, the spirit tablet of Mencius' Mother, the Pu Xiang Terrace where Mencius aired his books, the Ink Washing Pool, and the Zi Si Temple. The bricks and stones were used to build fortifications, and the pillars were used as firewood. At that time, Meng Fanji, the 74th generation descendant of Mencius and the official in charge of offering sacrifices at the Mencius Mansion, protested, but to no avail. Now, the Mencius Temple and the Mencius Mansion are desolate and completely different from their former appearance. Meng Zhaozeng said angrily, \"They (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's troops) talk about respect and protection all the time, but this is what they do!\" He praised the People's Liberation Army for taking great care of the Mencius Temple and other cultural relics, believing that the People's Liberation Army's words and deeds were consistent.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东收复章邱龙山我军前锋直逼济南　孟子后裔控诉蒋匪罪行\n\n1948-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东收复章邱龙山我军前锋直逼济南\n    孟子后裔控诉蒋匪罪行\n    【新华社华东前线一日电】解放军于上月二十三日向章邱、龙山地区进击，侵占章邱及龙山仅数日之蒋军闻风西窜，我当即收复上述两地，并跟踪追击逃敌。二十四日上午，我复将逃集韩仓、邬店、十里铺、虞山、合二庄、枣园寺、曹家铺、方家庄、吕家等地（均在济南以东二十五里至四十五里一线）之蒋军整七三师十五、七七两旅、整二师之二一三旅及保安团等部完全击溃，上述各地悉被我军攻占，残敌纷纷向王舍人庄及其以西地区溃逃。现我军前锋已直逼济南东郊二十里地区。据初步统计：是役共毙伤敌一千余名，生俘敌三百三十名；缴获六○炮一门，轻机枪二十八挺，冲锋枪五支，长短枪三百支。\n    【又讯】上月十五日我攻克邹县城之役俘虏中，现已查明有山东省保安第三旅副旅长兼邹县城防司令葛鳌，该旅二团上校团喻延龄等敌军军官多人。\n    【新华社华东前线二日电】邹县孟庙及孟府等文物古迹，已遭蒋军摧毁殆尽。孟子第七十二世孙孟昭增于此次邹县解放之次日（六月十六日），特向保护孟庙的解放军控诉蒋军破坏罪行。据称：日寇投降后，在此次战斗中为我击毙之国民党邹县县长巩震寰，即借口妨碍城防，下令将孟母三迁故居、孟母神位及孟子晒书的曝香台，洗砚池、子思庙等全部拆毁，将砖石修了工事，柱子当了柴烧。当时，孟府奉祀官孟子第七十四世孙孟繁骥曾提出抗议，但毫无效果。现孟庙及孟府满目荒芜，全非旧观。孟昭增愤愤的说：“他们（指蒋军）满口的尊重保护，就是如此！”他并盛赞解放军对孟庙等文物古迹爱护备至，认为解放军言行一致。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 2nd: The people of all social strata in Kaifeng warmly support the People's Liberation Army's various democratic policies and decrees, and are automatically cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to maintain social order. The day after Kaifeng was liberated (the 24th), more than 30 industrialists and businessmen in the city gathered to discuss how to quickly resume business. At the meeting, representatives of the People's Liberation Army explained the CCP's industrial and commercial policies of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and management, which were unanimously supported by the participants. The next day, large and small shops in Gulou Street, Madao Street, and Bookstore Street in the central area of the city successively began business. On the 25th, the people of Nanguan also automatically contacted the People's Liberation Army to assist in maintaining order in Nanguan. The People's Liberation Army's call for personnel from various public institutions, public banks, and enterprises to return to their original positions, work with peace of mind, and await instructions, was met with enthusiastic response. On the 24th, more than ten employees of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications returned to their respective banks and contacted the People's Liberation Army personnel to continue their service. The post office, which was set on fire and destroyed by the Chiang bandits, also had its employees send representatives to request the People's Liberation Army to designate a new location to resume operations. The Yellow River Conservancy Engineering Bureau suffered damage from the Chiang bandits during the battle, and the bureau's personnel requested protection, which the People's Liberation Army resolved one by one.

The area was originally only supposed to mobilize 900 stretchers and 600 carts, but within five days, the locals had automatically gathered 1,500 stretchers; Tongxu and Kaichen (a newly established county between Kaifeng and Chenliu) alone dispatched 600 carts. The concentration of stretchers was very rapid. Tongxu County issued a mobilization notice in the second half of the first day, and by the night of the next day, it had gathered 196 stretchers. The newly liberated Kaichen County gathered 116 stretchers and 113 carts in just one and a half days. The civilian laborers everywhere were extremely enthusiastic and determined to complete their tasks. Of the 250 stretchers supporting a certain unit, only one was lost along the way. Zhao Hui Village in Tongxu sent three stretchers and sixteen people. Except for one person who was sent to the hospital due to illness, the rest completed their tasks and had no complaints despite the day and night transportation. When Kaifeng was indiscriminately bombed by enemy planes, the civilian laborers who had been evacuated to avoid the air raids were able to quickly regroup and continue working after the all-clear signal. An old man over sixty years old, Ma Fuchen, also automatically drove his cart to deliver grain to the People's Liberation Army. When the PLA logistics personnel thanked him for his enthusiasm, the old man said, \"You must drive away Chiang Kai-shek!

    "content": "Kaifeng Battle Snippets\n\n　　　　　Captured Armored Train\n　　On the morning of the 18th, the Ninth Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)突入 rushed into the South Gate of Kaifeng and fiercely pursued the fleeing enemy northward. Just as they reached the railway line, Chiang Kai-shek's armored train No. 1152 came from the side, its cannons and machine-gun ports spewing out intense firepower, running back and forth along the railway, attempting to block our army from crossing the railway line. The warriors of the Ninth Company quickly scattered to the sides of the road, using armor-piercing weapons to cut off the train's path at both ends, while concentrating firepower to shoot at the armored train. Steel-core bullets and grenades flew into the carriages. The train was wounded and slowly stopped, and the enemy's guns and cannons also went silent. At this moment, a Chiang Kai-shek army officer crawled out of the carriage, waving a white flag in his hand, desperately shouting, \"We won't fight anymore, we surrender.\" Our army immediately ceased firing. Platoon Leader Liu Naizhao jumped onto the train, opened the hatch, and jumped inside. Jin Fusheng, the Chiang Kai-shek armored train company commander, mumbled to him: \"I just came from Zhengzhou yesterday. Your army's (referring to the PLA) firepower is too fierce. I wanted to wave the white flag a long time ago, but I didn't dare to raise my head.\" The Ninth Company captured the train and captured more than 70 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers alive, seizing × mountain guns, two 60mm mortars, and seven light and heavy machine guns, with only one death and one minor injury. The soldiers pointed to the paralyzed train and said with a smile, \"No matter how steel-headed and iron-bellied you are, you will end up as a prisoner in our hands.\"\n\n　　　　Zhu Huiliang Alone Occupies the High Ground of the South Gate\n    On the southeast corner of the South Gate of Kaifeng stood a brick and tile kiln more than three zhang high, surrounded by trenches one zhang wide and deep, and densely arranged stagings. An enemy platoon relied on a mother fort and four sub-bunkers of the kiln, commanding a high position, controlling the entire defensive position in the southeast corner, and preparing to defend this second line of defense to the death. On the 18th, a certain platoon of the People's Liberation Army was ordered to seize the kiln. After a fierce bombardment by our artillery, Squad Leader Zhu Huiliang broke through the stagings, picked up a submachine gun, braved the enemy's grenades, and took the lead in crossing the trench and rushing straight to the bottom of the kiln. The kiln was high and the walls were steep. Zhu Huiliang climbed three times and slipped down each time. Finally, he carried his submachine gun and climbed up stealthily, unexpectedly appearing on the top of the kiln. The enemy in the large mother fort hurriedly stretched out a light machine gun to shoot at him. Zhu Huiliang grabbed the microphone and shouted loudly: \"Surrender and receive preferential treatment, if you don't surrender, I will throw grenades at you.\" The enemy was so frightened that they all shrank into the kiln. Zhu Huiliang picked up the machine gun he had just captured and fired a burst of bullets into the cave, and the enemy shouted in unison: \"Spare our lives... we surrender.\" At this time, Second Squad Leader Kong Zhaolun also led the soldiers to rush up. The enemy in the kiln, a whole platoon, came out of the kiln one after another, holding their guns.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　[Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 30th]\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开封战斗片断\n\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开封战斗片断\n  　　　　　缴获铁甲列车\n    十八日清晨，解放军某团九连一举突入开封南关，向北猛追溃敌，刚到铁路边上，蒋军第一一五二号铁甲车从侧面而来，炮和机枪眼喷射出炽盛火力，沿铁道来回奔驶，企图阻拦我军突过铁道线。九连勇士们迅速向路侧散开，以穿甲武器在东西两头切断列车去路，同时集中火力对铁甲车一齐射击，钢心弹和手榴弹纷纷钻进了车厢。列车受了伤，慢慢停下来，敌军的枪炮也变哑了。这时车厢里钻出一个蒋军军官，手里摇摆着白旗，拼命地喊：“我们不打了，缴枪。”我军当即停止射击，刘乃兆排长跳上列车，揭开车盖，跳进车去，敌铁甲列车中队长靳福升喃喃地对他说：“俺昨天才从郑州开来，贵军（指解放军）火力太猛，俺早想摇白旗，一直没敢抬头。”九连仅以轻伤一亡一的代价，即缴获该列车并活捉其中蒋军七十多名，缴获山炮×门、六零炮二门、轻重机枪七挺。战士们指着瘫痪的列车，笑着说：“凭你钢头铁肚皮，也少不了在俺手下当俘虏。”\n    　　　　朱会良独占南关制高点\n    开封南关东南角上，矗立着一座三丈多高的砖瓦大窑，四周挖有宽深各一丈的壕沟，并筑着密排的鹿砦，守敌一个排凭借大窑的一个母堡、四个子碉，居高临下，控制着东南角整个防御阵地，准备死守这第二道防线。十八日白书，解放军某排奉命夺取大窑，班长朱会良在我炮兵猛轰后突破鹿砦，端起冲锋枪，冒着敌军手榴弹带头越过壕沟直扑窑下。窑高壁陡，朱会良爬了三次都滑下来。最后他背起冲锋枪隐蔽地用力往上爬，出敌不意突然出现在窑顶。大母堡敌军慌忙伸出轻机枪要向他射击，朱会良猛一把抓住话筒，大声喊道：“缴枪受优待，不缴枪我向你投手榴弹。”敌军吓得一齐缩进了窑洞。朱会良端起刚夺获的机枪，向洞里扫射一梭子弹，敌军就齐喊：“饶命……俺缴枪。”这时二班长孔昭伦也率领战士冲了上去，窑里的敌军一个整排，一个跟一个地举着枪钻出大窑来。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社开封前线三十日电】"

The democratic government is using great effort to help them. In Qu Yang's fifth district, there are forty-eight administrative villages. After land reform, they received 58,672 jin of grain in water conservancy loans and 35,420,000 yuan (border currency, same below) in loans from the government. With the help of these grain and money loans, the peasants in eleven villages along the Sha River, including Nanbeishuiyu, Zhifang, and Chande, dug twelve large and small canals, using 4,750 workdays. They created 1,735 mu of beach land, of which 1,068 mu have already been sown this year. Nine villages in the Lulugou area, including Hechian, used 1,080 workdays to dig 226 ponds (small-scale reservoirs), which can irrigate 243 mu of land. The Mengxian United Canal and Saigou Canal have been completed, and three new canals—Jingui She Canal, Xia Hua Canal, and Huili Canal—have been opened, which can irrigate 166 mu of land. Wutai has completed projects such as the Liujiazhuang and Xiufeng Canals. Near Dongye, in villages like Yongxing and Yong'an, the management methods for the canals have been improved, increasing irrigated land by more than 90 mu. The peasants of Dajian'an silted 200 mu of land and organized a land reclamation team, improving 130 mu, all of which have now been sown. The newly opened Beishe East-West Canals in Dingxiang can irrigate 600 mu of land. In the past, more than 1,300 mu of land on both sides of the Puji Canal could not be irrigated. This year, it was decided to release water half a month earlier in the fall specifically to supply irrigation to the downstream areas, which will allow an additional 2,300 mu to be irrigated. The Shunshui Canal being built in Hengqiangwan can protect 12,160 mu of land. The Miaotou village in Pingshan has a total of 115 households. Except for 13 elderly and widowed families, all men, women, and children participated in the canal construction and land reclamation, starting at the end of February, using 32,540 workdays to reclaim more than 440 mu of beach land, which is now planted with 100 mu of black beans and 200 mu of rice. Hujiazhuang village in Lingshou, with the help of the democratic government, reclaimed 120 mu of beach land, which can increase production by 20 dan of miscellaneous grains each year. Recently, at the request of the masses and under the active leadership of Li Yongcheng, director of the New Peasants' Association, thirteen teams have been organized to reclaim another 70 mu of wasteland. The masses are in high spirits. From 1939 onwards, 52,908 mu of land in the twenty-two villages from Baidian to Zhuhe in Zhengding were gradually washed away by the river. The river channel has approached the edges of villages such as Hucun, Taipingzhuang, and Guojiazhuang, which is very dangerous. In order to protect the people's land and lives and property, the government has provided a loan of 300 dan of grain. The county, district, and village have organized river management committees to lead the people in building dikes, preparing to complete them before the rainy season. Diaoqiao Village has already completed a dike four li long, using 1,600 workdays, which can protect 63,000 mu of land from further erosion.\n    (Gao Feng, Tang Chunli, Peng Jishen, Zhang Jinfu, Ren Jian, Yongfu, Gu Yufa, Zhen Ma, Chen Lu)\n    [Central Hebei News] The Gaocheng County Production Promotion Cooperative convened a meeting of district agricultural loan officers on June 20 to summarize the loan work of the past six months. In the past six months, the county has used loans to drive private capital to develop water conservancy, achieving considerable success. At the beginning, the county promotion cooperative, on the one hand, went to districts and villages to understand the situation and organize, and on the other hand, invested 100 million yuan (border currency, same below) in waterwheel factories, ordering 200 waterwheels. At the same time, it bought 250,000 jin of coal and invested it in four brick kilns, preparing 150,000 bricks, and invested 20 million yuan in lumber yards, anticipating more than 1,000 water buckets. It spent 5 million yuan to buy bamboo tubes, palm fiber, iron wire and other well-drilling equipment. It was distributed according to the needs of the masses, and tried to drive private capital and use floating wealth as much as possible. All loan households, after being approved by the county, could open a loan slip in the cooperative and get the actual goods. Feng Village in the first district, with more than 100 households, borrowed 13.2 million yuan, driving 5 million yuan of private capital. 46 households bought agricultural tools, more than 30 households bought bone meal, and they also repaired six wells, expanding the irrigated land by 120 mu. As of June 20, 34 wells had been drilled in the county, with loans of 48.24 million yuan and use of floating capital of 33.9 million yuan. 142 wells were repaired. Loans totaled 77.28 million yuan, driving 40.99 million yuan of private capital. 19 waterwheels were purchased, with loans of 46.61 million yuan, driving 18.1 million yuan of private capital (not including those completely purchased and repaired by private individuals). 101 waterwheels were repaired, with loans of 72.61 million yuan, driving 19.15 million yuan of private capital. In the past six months, the county has also issued 166.671 million yuan in loans for agricultural tools and livestock, driving 4.193 million yuan of private capital, and buying 165 head of livestock and a set of agricultural tools. In order to solve the fertilizer problem, the county promotion cooperative also sent special personnel to manufacture bone fertilizer and sell it to the masses at low prices. In order to facilitate the purchase of the masses, the bone-steaming boilers were rotated and moved. This decentralized sales method was very popular among the masses.\n    (Reporters Yao Fu, Huai Yu)\n    [Central Hebei News] Water conservancy construction in Gaocheng County has been greatly developed under the support of the democratic government. The county originally planned to open 14 branch canals throughout the year, and one-half, with a total length of 62 li, had been completed in the spring. Two-fifths of the small branch canals have also been completed. The main canal project has basically been completed. The county newly dug a 420-meter-long diversion river, diverting all the Hutuo River water into the diversion river. The canals cover 50 villages, and 90% of the wheat fields (more than 470,000 mu) have been universally watered once, and one-fourth of the villages have been watered twice. Each village established a water conservancy committee during canal construction to lead the construction. After completion, the water usage methods were stipulated through democratic discussion by the masses, which greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the masses. Last year, there were seven laborers participating in canal digging in Chi Fan Village. This year, there were more than 1,000 participants. Farmers in villages near the branch canals voluntarily contributed more than 20,000 bricks and built 42 new sluice gates, expanding the original irrigated area by two-thirds, enabling irrigation of 8,000 mu of land. Last year, each worker could only dig one to four cubic meters per day, but this year they can dig four to eight cubic meters. Women also actively participated in canal construction. The branch canal project was originally planned to be completed in eight days, but it was completed in five days.\n    (Note: The manuscript on river management and canal opening in various parts of Northern Yue is a compilation of manuscripts from many correspondents. The original manuscript lacks reports on the process and experience. Please continue to report on the construction situation and experience of important projects. The manuscript on Gaocheng's loans to help farmers develop water conservancy should also choose key points to continue to report with specific processes and experience lessons. - Editor)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开渠·治河·打井·造水车　北岳冀中各地兴修水利　 藁城生产推进社以贷款推动私资　民主政府扶植水利建设\n\n1948-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开渠·治河·打井·造水车\n    北岳冀中各地兴修水利\n    藁城生产推进社以贷款推动私资\n    民主政府扶植水利建设\n    【北岳讯】北岳各地翻身农民积极兴修水利增加生产。民主政府用很大力量帮助他们。曲阳五区有四十八个行政村，土改后得到政府水利贷粮五万八千六百七十二斤，贷款三千五百四十二万元（边币，下同）。沙河两岸南北水峪、纸坊、产德等十一村的农民，在这笔贷粮贷款的帮助下，开了大小渠十二道，用工四千七百五十个。修成滩地一千七百三十五亩，今年已下种一千零六十八亩。辘轳沟内河赤岸等九村，用了一千零八十个工，挖汪（小型水池）二百二十六个，能浇地二百四十三亩。孟县联合渠、赛沟渠已经完工，又新开进圭社渠、下花渠、会里渠三道，可浇地一百六十六亩。五台完成了刘家庄与秀峰渠等工程；又在东冶附近永兴永安等村，改善了渠道的管理方法，增加水地九十余亩。大建安农民淤成二百亩地，并组织了整滩组，整好一百三十余亩，现在都已下种。定襄新开的北社东西渠，可浇地六百亩。普济渠两侧过去有一千三百多亩地浇不上水，今年决定秋后提早放水半月，专门供给下游浇地，这样即可多浇两千三百多亩。横墙湾一带兴修顺水渠，可护地一万二千一百六十亩。平山庙头村共一百一十五户，除十三家孤寡外，其余男女老少都参加了修渠成滩，从二月底开始，用工三万二千五百四十个，修成滩地四百四十余亩，现已种了黑豆一百亩，稻子二百亩。灵寿胡家庄曾在民主政府帮助下，整出一百二十亩滩地，每年可增产二十大石杂粮。最近在群众要求和新农会主任李永成积极领导下，组织了十三个组，着手再修荒滩七十亩，群众情绪很高。正定白店到朱河的二十二个村，从民国二十八年起，有五万二千九百零八亩地被河水逐渐冲没。河身已迫近胡村、太平庄、郭家庄等村村边，非常危险。政府为了保护群众的土地与生命财产，特贷粮三百大石，县区村都组织了治河委员会，领导群众修堤，准备雨季以前完成。现在刁桥村已完成一道长达四里的长堤，共用一千六百个工。能保护土地六万三千亩，不致被水继续冲坏。\n    　（高峰、唐春力、彭济身、张进福、任健、永福、谷毓发、甄马、陈芦）\n    【冀中讯】藁城县生产推进社于六月二十日召开区农贷员会议，总结半年的贷款工作。半年以来，该县以贷款带动私资发展水利，获得不少成绩。县推进社在开始时，一方面到区村了解情况进行组织，一方面投资一亿元（边币，下同）于水车工厂，预订水车二百架。同时买煤廿五万斤投入四座砖窑，预备砖十五万块，投资两千万元于木厂，预计水斗子一千余个。以五百万元买下竹筒、树棕、铁丝等打井器材。根据群众需要发放，并尽可能带动私资，运用浮财。所有贷款户经县批准，便可到社内开条贷到实物。一区百余户的冯村贷款一千三百二十万元，带动私资五百万，有四十六户买到农具，三十余户买到骨粉，还修井六眼，增广水地一百二十亩。截至六月二十日止，全县已打井三十四眼，贷款四千八百二十四万元，使用浮财三千三百九十万元。修井一百四十二眼。贷款七千七百二十八万元，带动私资四千零九十九万元。买水车十九架，贷款四千六百六十一万元，带动私资一千八百一十万元（完全由私人买修者未计在内），修水车一百零一架，贷款七千二百六十一万元，带动私资一千九百十五万元。半年来，该县又发放农具和牲畜贷款一亿六千六百七十一万元，带动私资四千一百九十三万元，买牲口一六五头和农具一部。县推进社为解决肥料问题，又派专人制造骨肥，贱价卖给群众，为便利群众购买，以蒸骨锅炉轮回移动，这种分散出卖办法，群众非常欢迎。　　　　　　　　　　　\n　　　　　　　　　　（记者药夫、槐玉）\n    【冀中讯】藁城县水利建设，在民主政府扶植下，已有很大开展。该县原计划全年新辟十四道支渠，在春天已完成二分之一，全长六十二华里。小支渠也完成了五分之二。干渠工程基本上已经完成。该县新挖一道四百二十米长的引河，把滹沱河水全部引到引河内。渠道普及五十个村，百分之九十的麦田（四十七万余亩）曾普遍浇过一次，其中四分之一的村庄浇了二次。开渠时各村都建立了水利委员会，领导兴工。竣工后通过群众民主讨论，规定使水办法，大大启发了群众的积极性。匙樊庄去年参加挖渠的有七个水工，今年参加的有一千余名。支渠附近村庄的农民自动出砖二万多块，建立了四十二个新闸，扩大了原有浇地面积的三分之二，能浇地八千亩。去年每个民工每天只挖一方到四方，今年能挖四方到八方。妇女也积极参加了修渠。支渠工程原计划八天完成，结果五天就完成了。\n    （按：北岳各地治河开渠一稿系综合多数通讯员稿写成，原稿中缺乏过程及经验的报导，请各地通讯员同志继续报导重要工程的施工情形和经验。藁城贷款帮助农民发展水利一稿，也请选择重点继续作有具体过程、有经验教训的报导。——编者）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, July 27th: Under the influence of the victorious advance of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, incidents of the people of Gansu resisting the Chiang bandit's conscription tyranny are increasing daily. The Chiang authorities are conscripting soldiers in various counties of Gansu Province with extreme urgency. Qingshui is a third-class small county with a population of less than 100,000, and more than 700 conscripts were seized in February and March of this year alone. After Ma Bufang's Qinghai Hui army suffered heavy casualties at the hands of our army in Heshui last year, they rampantly conscripted soldiers in Ningding, Hezheng, Yongjing and other counties in December. In February of this year, Ma Hongkui's Ningxia Hui army dispatched a battalion of soldiers to Lintao County and seized 600 people, causing the local young and strong men to flee in droves, hiding in the mountains during the day and not daring to return home at night. As conscription becomes increasingly difficult, the Chiang authorities are forcing the people to pay to hire \"conscripts.\" The price of hiring soldiers in Gansu is extremely high. In Hezheng, Ningding, Yongjing and other counties, the price of a conscript is at least 500 silver dollars, and in some cases as much as 1,000 silver dollars. In Guyuan County, one conscript costs 18 shi of wheat, which, at the local price of 400,000 yuan in Kuomintang currency per dou, amounts to more than 70 million yuan, which is forcibly apportioned to the people. The people in the Chiang-controlled areas of Gansu are unable to bear the conscription and extortion, and spontaneous resistance incidents continue to occur. For example, in Ningding, a young man stabbed the head of the Jia twice and fled in order to resist conscription. A Kuomintang-appointed Bao chief of the Chenjiahe Xian Township Office in Jingning County took several Bao soldiers to Duanjiaping at night to conscript soldiers. Two brothers who made a living selling oil encountered the Bao chief's conscription on their way home. During their resistance to the arrest, they injured the Bao chief with machetes and fled. An evil bully in Hezheng County, who had worked under Ma Bufang, used conscription as an excuse to extort money everywhere, which was deeply hated by the local people. He was eventually killed by a shoemaker. In the struggle against the counter-revolutionary tyranny of Chiang and Ma, the people of Gansu are becoming increasingly aware. The people of Guyuan are circulating such a ballad: \"I would rather be a member of the Eighth Route Army than a soldier of the Ma family. If I become a soldier of the Ma family, I will defect to the Eighth Route Army.\" They eagerly hope that the People's Liberation Army will go to rescue them as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 甘肃人民反抗蒋匪抓丁\n\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　甘肃人民反抗蒋匪抓丁\n    【新华社西北二十七日电】在西北人民解放军胜利进军影响之下，甘肃人民反抗蒋匪抓丁暴政事件日多。蒋当局在甘肃省各县抓丁急如星火。清水是一个三等小县，人口不到十万，今年二、三两月即被抓去壮丁七百余名。青海回军马步芳部去年在合水遭我军重大杀伤后，十二月曾在宁定、和政、永靖等县大肆抓丁。今年二月宁夏回军马鸿逵部派兵一营在临洮县抓了六百名，致该地青壮年都纷纷逃跑，白天躲在山里，晚上也不敢回家。蒋当局以抓丁日趋困难，复强迫人民出款雇买“壮丁”。现甘肃雇兵价格极高，和政、宁定、永靖等县一名壮丁要价少者五百白洋，多的甚至一千白洋。固原县一丁索价十八石小麦，以当地价格每斗合蒋币四十万计算，则达七千多万，强迫摊派给人民负担。甘肃蒋区各地人民不堪抓丁和勒索压榨，自发反抗事件不断发生。如宁定一青年为反抓丁，把甲长戳了两刀后逃走。靖宁县陈家壑岘乡公所蒋记保长，黑夜带着几名保丁到段家坪去抓丁，有贩油为生的兄弟两人，归途遇着保长抓丁，拒捕中用马刀将保长砍伤后逃跑。和政县一曾在马步芳手下干事的恶霸到处借抓丁进行勒索，深为当地人民痛恨，终被一鞋匠将其杀死。甘肃人民在反抗蒋马反革命暴虐统治斗争中，觉悟性日益提高。固原人民流传着这样的歌谣：“愿当八路军，不当马家兵，若当马家兵，投奔八路军。”热望人民解放军早日前往解救他们。"

    "content": "Shijiazhuang Municipal Government Protects Citizens' Property Rights; Successively Returns Confiscated Properties\n　　[Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Municipal Democratic Government has consistently implemented the policy of effectively protecting the property rights of citizens. After investigation, properties belonging to minor puppets or clerks of the enemy and puppets, or those who had to work under the enemy and puppet rule due to livelihood constraints, or those who, although working under the enemy and puppet rule, operated legitimate businesses and did not seize people's property by force, have been successively returned. Recently, three confiscated theaters and all the properties of Ge Jiantang, the former puppet district chief, were returned. Ge is from Hejia Village, Huolu County, and engaged in the coal business in Shijiazhuang. After the \"July 7th Incident,\" he colluded with the Japanese and puppet regime to establish Liu Da Company. After the Japanese surrender, in the 34th year of the Republic of China, he served as the chief of the First District and a member of the参议员 under the Kuomintang, and was one of the major landlords in Shijiazhuang. Before and after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Ge and others, fearing punishment, fled to Peiping and Tianjin one after another. Their abandoned properties were left unattended, and the municipal government temporarily took custody of all his properties. Later, his relative Zhang Zongyong saw the municipal government's announcement regarding property issues and understood the policies of the democratic government. He immediately applied to the government for assistance in reclaiming the properties. The government, considering that he was not a die-hard traitor but only a minor puppet of the enemy, decided to handle the matter leniently and approved the application. On the 14th of this month, 44 houses, the Shengguang Theater, and three plots of land belonging to Ge Jiantang were returned. The People's Theater originally belonged to the Xingshang Construction Group formed by merchants Zhu Yinzhi and others. The group built the Tongle Theater in the second year of the Republic of China and leased it to Li Wenbing in the 29th year, renaming it Yong'an Cinema. In the 30th year, Li subleased it to the Japanese Shiratsu Jo, renaming it North China Cinema. After the Japanese surrender, Yao Bingfu of the Kuomintang Central Committee forcibly seized it under the pretext of enemy property, renaming it Central Cinema. After several negotiations by the construction group, Yao admitted their property rights but still refused to return it. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, Zhu Yinzhi, unaware of the laws of the democratic government, did not dare to come forward to claim it, so the government took it under management. After the municipal government issued an announcement protecting citizens' property rights, Zhu, representing the construction group, applied to the government in early April for the return of the property. After investigation and confirmation, the government immediately approved the return. The China Cinema was also returned at the same time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石市政府保护市民财权产权　陆续发还代管房产\n\n1948-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石市政府保护市民财权产权\n    陆续发还代管房产\n    【石家庄讯】石市民主政府一贯贯彻切实保护市民财权产权的政策，业经查明确系敌伪小爪牙小职员或只为生活所迫不得不在敌伪统治下工作，或虽在敌伪统治下工作，但其经营均系合法营业，并未依势强占人民财产等行为者，其财产均已陆续发还。近又发还代管之三座剧院及前伪区长葛鉴堂全部房产。葛系获鹿县贺家庄人，在石市经营煤，“七七”事变后，与日伪勾结开办柳大公司，日寇投降后，于民国三十四年任国民党第一区区长和参议员等职，为石市大房主之一。石庄解放前后，葛等畏罪先后逃往平津，所遗房产无人照管，市府将其全部房产暂行代管。后其亲属张宗咏见到市府有关财产问题的布告，了解了民主政府的政策，当即申请政府代为具领，政府因其并非死心踏地的汉奸，仅为敌伪小爪牙，决定从宽处理，已予批准，于本月十四日发还葛鉴堂房产四十四所，声光剧院一所及地皮三段。人民剧院原属商民朱吟芝等所组之兴商建筑团，该团于民国二年建成同乐戏院，二十九年出租给李文炳，改名永安影院，三十年由李转租给日本人白津让，改名为华北影院。日寇投降后，蒋党中部姚炳绂以敌产为借口强行接收，改名中央影院。经建筑团几次交涉，姚某虽承认其产权，但仍强占不还。石庄解放后，朱吟芝不明民主政府法令，未敢出面请领，政府乃代为管理，市府发出保护市民产权的布告后，朱即代表建筑团于四月初向政府申请发还该项产业，经调查确实，政府当即批准发还。同时发还者尚有中华电影院。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: The party rectification experience in Huangjiachuan Village, Suide, the party rectification experience in Pingshan County broadcast on February 27th, and the party rectification experience in the ninth district of Wu'an, Taihang broadcast on April 20th, are all successful party rectification experiences and worthy of learning from. The experience of Huangjiachuan Village in adjusting land was also reported on February 28th and has received attention from various regions. According to a report from our Northwest Branch, after the village's farmers' association completed the land adjustment work, it found during the land boundary survey and determination of land rights that the previous investigation of certain situations was not accurate enough, and the handling of certain land was not appropriate enough. As reported on February 28th, before the adjustment, there were three landlords, 31 poor and hired peasants, five well-to-do middle peasants, and 36 middle peasants in the village. After this investigation, it should be changed to two landlords, one rich peasant, five well-to-do middle peasants, and 33 middle peasants. Also, after the adjustment, one middle peasant privately exchanged two *mu* of land that should have been left for the landlord with one and a half *mu* of middle-grade land that was allocated to him; a landlord's family had three people who fled and did not return, so no land was left for them; individual single men and disabled people were given too much consideration when allocating land; and one middle peasant voluntarily contributed five *mu* of land at the time, but later his family expressed regret. Based on these situations, the village farmers' association made some necessary corrections after discussion with the masses. The per capita output of each class in February was 6.84 *dou* for landlords and rich peasants, 7 to 7.03 *dou* for middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, and 7.6 *dou* for poor and hired peasants. After this correction, it was: 7 *dou* for landlords and rich peasants, 7.25 *dou* to 7.57 *dou* for middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, and 7.04 *dou* for poor and hired peasants. This reduced the amount of land taken from the middle peasants and made it easier for landlords and rich peasants to maintain their livelihoods. After this correction, the farmers' association, in coordination with the township government, issued land certificates, announcing that the land distribution in the village would no longer be changed. Thus, the land reform in the village was finally completed. The party rectification work in the village mentioned in this newsletter was carried out on this basis.\n\n    Since Huangjiachuan Village in Yihe District, Suide, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, completed its preliminary party rectification work, the relationship between party members and the masses has become closer, and a leadership position at the core of the masses has been formed. In the preliminary party rectification process, the village first did three things well: (1) It made the branch public, breaking the mystery of the Party. (2) It promoted inner-party and extra-party democracy, combining party meetings with mass meetings to create better communication between party members and the masses. (3) The number of party members more than doubled, breaking through the narrow circle of the past and strengthening the forces (for many years in the rural areas of northern Shaanxi, very few party members have been developed; some branches have not accepted a new party member for ten years, and all party members have more than ten years of party membership, so it is now very necessary to develop a group of new party members). In this way, the entire old set of coercive orders and monopolistic practices was negated. However, new problems then arose: First, party members did not know how to lead the masses and what to lead the masses to do. Some party members with problems, seeing the strength of the masses in the review process, said: \"It will be difficult to be a party member in the future.\" Some, because their bad styles were negated and they had not learned the new mass style, doubted: \"How can we monitor bad people when the masses know every move of the party members?\" Second, the masses, just after the end of land reform, had a tendency towards extreme democracy, often requiring even very small things to be resolved by the general assembly. Third, the new party members were relatively serious and cautious in their work and very energetic, but some individual party members were secretly unconvinced. For example, when the old party member Huang Xianghai heard that nearby villages were implementing corrections because they had moved the land and property of middle peasants, he wanted to restore the party in his village to a secret state.\n\n    Based on these situations, the work team immediately helped the branch to start with education, improve them ideologically and politically, strengthen inner-party unity, and help them form a core force. For example, after the victory in Yichuan, they reported the news of our army's victory, talked about the overall situation of the country, the strength of the Party, and the future of the revolution, and then talked about the conditions for being a party member, and even linked it to organizational principles. This kind of party class was sometimes taught by comrades from the work team and sometimes by the branch secretary. The way of teaching sometimes started with reporting the news, sometimes with problems occurring in the township and village, and sometimes by first mobilizing everyone to discuss and solve practical problems, and then linking it to some principles. When a dispute occurred between the old party member Huang Shaoju and the new party member Huang Malu, the group leader first led them to communicate their opinions and clarify the rights and wrongs, and then inspired everyone to discuss the unity of new and old cadres and the unity of the entire Party. When the party member Huang Pengming had a quarrel with the non-party village head, the group leader led them to carry out self-examination, with the individuals making self-criticisms, and finally discussed the relationship between the Party and the masses. With this kind of teaching method, the party members were very enthusiastic about learning, and the masses also loved to listen. In addition to party members, there were always ten or twenty non-party masses participating in each meeting. These non-party masses often helped the party members put forward methods suitable for the village. For example, after completing the lesson on party and mass unity, everyone agreed on three specific measures: (1) When discussing issues related to the masses within the Party, be sure to invite the masses to participate in Party meetings to gather ideas and jointly consult. (2) Party members should adopt the method of making friends, naturally making friends with a group of people around them, listening to their \"voices\" regularly, leading them in production, and influencing and educating them to follow the Party. Most of the thirteen mutual aid groups in the village are now led by party members. As a result of party members uniting the masses in this way, the factional opposition that originally existed among the masses has also been eliminated invisibly. (3) Each party member is assigned to help with an administrative task and is responsible for doing it well, and regularly reports to the Party. For example, Huang Weihua and Huang Xianqing are responsible for doing a good job in the farmers' association; Huang Xiangui and Huang Xian help with production and disaster relief; Hao Peilian is responsible for women's work; Huang Genzhen is in charge of water conservancy matters; the forces of the Party's activities are distributed in every work link in the village.\n\n    Secondly, the work team guided the branch to specifically help the masses solve difficulties, and thereby established the branch's prestige among the masses. During the spring plowing, the township instructed the village to send seven people to the Yellow River to transport grain. The Party first studied how to successfully complete the task without affecting the production of the masses. As a result, it was agreed to encourage voluntary registration by means of mutual aid and substitute plowing. However, the masses were not used to going out, and some were still worried about life on the road. The Party then decided to send a party member to take the lead and take care of everyone's life on the road. The party member Huang Dengbao had surplus labor and also needed mutual aid, so he volunteered at the mass meeting, which then influenced and promoted the masses to complete the task. After they left, the Party led the mutual aid group to plant summer crops for those who went to transport grain. When they returned, they exceeded the scheduled time on the road, and the Party launched the farmers' association to implement condolences, and mobilized the masses to pay some compensation according to the exceeded date to encourage them. To develop sideline occupations, the Party first mobilized the masses to discuss and promote it, creating a fever. Huang Erwang wanted to make tofu but did not have the capital, so the group discussed and decided that the party member Huang Shaoju would assist him. Huang Chengwen did not have a millstone, so the party member Huang Congsheng lent it to him. In order to encourage everyone to transport coal and salt, the party member Huang Malu went to try it out first, and earned nearly 150,000 yuan in agricultural currency on the first trip, which immediately spread throughout the village. Therefore, the village transported coal thirty times during the spring plowing gap, earning nearly 3.5 million yuan in agricultural currency. The middle peasant Xue Shangtai knew how to dye cloth, and the group decided to help him open a dyeing workshop in the village. So the group divided the work to encourage the individual and persuade the masses to assist. Some people disliked his bad temper and initially disagreed very much, but party members explained the benefits of opening a dyeing workshop to the township and district, and slowly gained the support of the entire village, borrowing more than 3 million agricultural currency of public property, and the dyeing workshop opened. Xue Shangtai and other masses recognized the Communist Party's policy from these concrete facts that helped them, and the party members also had confidence in the mass work.\n\n    In addition, the Party took the initiative to study and solve many problems in the work of the farmers' association and administrative work, so that the Party was closely integrated with the farmers' association and the government. The village is located on the main road, with many errands. The village head and village councilors (i.e., village representatives) were most troubled by the disorder and unfairness of stretcher errands and donkey errands, which affected production. The Party coordinated with the farmers' association to organize everyone to study solutions, and finally agreed to implement work and errand recording, reward the good, criticize the bad, and improve the system. The Party mobilized party members to support this system, and as a result, it was effective and convenient for everyone. After the land reform, the masses' biggest ideological concern was that there were too many malpractices in the previous public grain burden and the disorder and irrationality of the work of giving preferential treatment to military families. The Party proposed to the masses to study and discuss these two issues since last winter. Because the amount of land in the village has not varied greatly since the land reform the year before last, the masses unanimously decided to levy public grain based on the annual output of the land after repeated discussions. The preferential treatment for military families was also studied and decided to be contracted by the substitute farmers according to the annual output of the land, that is, the contractors would hand over grain to the military families according to the annual output, and the excess of the annual output would be owned by the contractors, and the shortfall would be paid by the contractors. This not only guaranteed the lives of the military families but also encouraged the contractors to work hard to produce. These methods and systems were first researched and proposed by the Party organization, which not only enriched the content of Party meetings and gave play to the enthusiasm of party members but also increased the faith of the Party among the masses. Because the Party constantly studies and solves various problems in the masses and in administration, a very close form of cooperation has been established between the Party and administrative organs and mass organizations. Now the best party member in the village, Huang Weihua, is the leader of the Party group and has been elected as the director of the farmers' association. The non-party labor hero Ma Chaofan is the village head and the director of the farmers' association's production and disaster relief committee. Hao Peilian, a production model, is the director of women and the deputy village head. In their actual work, they have naturally established a good coordination system. For example, when the Party holds a meeting to discuss village affairs, it invites the non-party village head to participate, and the village head automatically consults the farmers' association or the Party when there is something to do. In daily activities, the steps of Party cadres and non-Party cadres are coordinated, and mutual examinations are carried out in their work, so the work is very energetic, and a unified leadership core has been formed. The problem of convening a general meeting for very small matters in the past has been corrected. All the Party's propositions and resolutions can be implemented through this core.\n\n[Xinhua News Agency Northwest Second Telegram]\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 绥德黄家川初步整党的经验\n\n1948-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　绥德黄家川初步整党的经验\n    新华社编者按：绥德黄家川村的整党经验，与二月廿七日广播的平山县整党经验，及四月二十日广播的太行武安九区整党经验，都是成功的整党经验，值得各地借鉴。黄家川村调剂土地的经验，亦曾于二月二十八日报导，并受到各地的注意。现据本社西北总分社报导，该村农会在调剂土地工作结束不久后进行勘划地界确定地权时，发现前此对于某些情况的调查，还不够确切，某些土地的处理，也还不够适当。如二月二十八日报导，该村在调剂前全村地主三户，贫雇农三十一户，富裕中农五户，中农三十六户。经过这次调查，应改为地主两户，富农一户，富裕中农五户，中农三十三户。又在调剂后有一户中农将应留给地主的两垧土地私自与分给自己的一垧半中地换了；一户地主家中有三人逃亡未归，没有留地；个别光身汉与残废分地时照顾太多；一户中农当时自愿抽地五垧，后来其家人又表后悔。该村农会根据这些情况经过群众讨论后，做了一些必要的修正。各阶层每人所得产量，二月间是地主富农六·八四斗，中农和富裕中农七至七·○三斗，贫雇农七·六斗。这次修正以后是：地主富农七斗，中农和富裕中农七·二五斗至七·五七斗，贫雇农七·○四斗。这样就减少了抽动中农的土地，并使地主富农的生活也容易维持。在此次修正后，农会即协同乡政府颁发了土地证，宣布该村土地分配不再变动。至此该村土地改革乃告最后结束。这篇通讯所说的该村整党工作，就是在这个基础上进行的。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    陕甘宁绥德义合区黄家川村，自完成初步整党工作之后，党员与群众关系已趋密切，并形成了群众核心的领导地位。该村在初步整党过程中，首先做好了三件事：（一）把支部公开，打破了党的神秘状态。（二）发扬了党内外民主，把党的会议与群众会议结合起来，使党员与群众之间通了气。（三）党员发展了一倍以上，冲破了过去狭小的圈子，增强了力量（陕北农村中多年来很少发展党员，有些支部十年来没有接收一个新党员，所有党员都有十年以上的党龄，故现在发展一批新党员，是十分必要）。这样，整个旧的一套强迫命令、包办代替的作风被否定了。但接着产生了新的问题：第一、党员不知道如何领导群众和领导群众作什么。有些有毛病的党员，在审查过程中看见了群众的力量，便说：“今后党员难当了。”有的因为不好的作风被否定，新的群众的作风未学会，怀疑说：“党员一举一动群众都知道，怎能监视坏人呢？”第二、群众在土改刚结束之后，有极端民主的倾向，往往连很小的事都要经由大会解决。第三、新党员工作都比较认真谨慎，很有朝气，但个别党员暗中有点不服。例如老党员黄向海当听说附近村庄因动了中农的土地财产而实行纠偏时，就还想把本村的党恢复秘密状态。\n    根据这些情况，工作组即帮助支部从教育着手，从思想上政治上提高他们，加强党内团结，帮助他们形成核心力量。例如宜川大捷后，便从报告我军胜利消息，讲到全国局面、党的力量、革命的前途，继而谈到作党员的条件、乃至联系讲到组织原则等。这种党课，有时由工作组的同志来讲，有时通过支书去讲。上课的方式有时由报告新闻讲起，有时由本乡本村发生的问题讲起，也有时先发动大家讨论，解决实际问题，然后联系到一些原则问题。老党员黄绍举和新党员黄马六发生纠纷，小组长先领导他们沟通意见，弄清是非，然后启发大家讨论新老干部团结问题和全党团结问题。党员黄朋明和非党员的村长闹架，小组长领导他们实行检讨，本人作自我批评，最后讨论到党和群众的关系问题。这样的上课方式，党员学习情绪很高，群众也很爱听。每次开会，除了党员以外，总有一二十个党外群众参加。这些党外群众还常常帮助党员提些适合本村的办法。例如上完党和群众团结这一课后，大家就商定了三项具体办法：（一）党内讨论有关群众的问题一定请群众参加党的会议，集思广益，共同协商。（二）党员采用交朋友的办法，每人自然地在自己周围结交一部分群众，经常听取他们的“呼声”，领导他们生产，影响和教育他们跟着党走。全村十三个变工小组，现在多数由党员带头。党员这样分头团结群众的结果，原来群众中存有派别对立的情形，也无形消除了。（三）每个党员分工帮助一件行政工作，并负责做好，经常向党内汇报。如黄维华、黄宪青负责搞好农会工作；黄宪贵、黄贤帮助生产救灾；郝培莲负责妇女工作；黄跟珍掌管水利事情；全村每一个工作环节上，都分布有党的活动力量。\n    其次工作组又引导支部具体帮助群众解决困难，并由此建立了支部在群众中的威信。春耕中，乡上指示要本村派七个人去黄河边运粮食，党内即先研究如何胜利完成任务，同时又不致影响群众生产，结果商定以变工和代耕的办法鼓励自愿报名。但群众没有外出习惯，有的对路上的生活还有顾虑，党内又决定派一个党员去带头，并在路上关照大家生活。党员黄登保劳动力有长余，也需要变工，即由他在群众大会上自告奋勇，接着影响推动群众，完成了任务。他们走后，党又领导变工小组分别把去运粮者的夏田种上了。他们返回时路上超过了预定时间，党又发动农会实行慰劳，按超过日期，发动群众付给一些代价，以资鼓励。发展副业，产时，党先发动群众酝酿座谈，宣传解说，造成热潮。黄二旺想做豆腐，没有本钱，小组商议由党员黄绍举资助他。黄成文没有磨子，由党员黄从圣借给他。为了鼓励大家运炭、运盐、由党员黄马六先去试运，第一回就赚到将及农币十五万元，全村人立即都传开了。因此该村在春耕空隙中，单是炭就贩了三十回，挣农币将及三百五十多万元。中农薛尚台会染布，小组会决定要帮助他在本村开染坊，于是小组分工去鼓励本人、劝说群众资助，一部分人嫌他脾气不好，开头很不同意，党员则分别解释开染坊对本乡本区的好处，慢慢地取得了全村群众拥护，借出三百多万农币的公共财物，染坊便开张了。薛尚台和其他群众从这些具体扶助他们的事实中，认识了共产党的政策，党员对群众工作也有了信心。\n    此外，党又主动研究解决农会工作和行政工作的许多问题，使党与农会和政府密切地结合了起来。该村位居大路，差务繁多，村长和村议员（即村代表）最感头痛的事是担架支差和毛驴支差的零乱和不公，以致影响生产。党内即协同农会组织大家研究办法，最后商定实行记工记差，奖励好的，批评坏的，健全制度。党内又动员党员支持这一制度，结果行之有效，人人称便。土改之后，群众在思想上最顾虑的，是以往公粮负担弊端太多，和优待军属工作的紊乱不合理。对于这两个问题，党从去冬即在群众中提出酝酿研究。因为该村自前年土改后土地数量悬殊不大，群众在反复讨论后，一致决定按土地常年产量计征公粮。对军属优待，亦经过研究，决定按土地常年产量由代耕人实行包耕，即由包耕者按常年产量交粮给军属，收粮超过常年产量时归包耕者所得，不足时由包工者垫给。这样既保证了军属生活，且鼓励了包耕者努力生产。这些办法和制度，都先由党内组织研究提出，不仅充实了党的会议内容，发挥了党员积极性，而且提高了党在群众中的信仰。由于党不断地研究解决群众中和行政中的各种问题，党与行政机关和群众团体之间，建立了一种很密切的合作形式。现在该村最好的党员黄维华是党的小组长，又被选为农会主任，非党劳动英雄马超凡是村长，又是农会生产救灾委员会主任；生产模范郝培莲是妇女主任，又是副村长。他们在实际工作中，很自然地树立了一种良好的配合制度。例如党内开会讨论村内事情，即请非党村长参加，村长有事自动找农会或党商量。在日常的活动中，党的干部与非党的干部步骤协调，加以在工作中相互检讨，因而工作都很起劲，已形成一个统一的领导核心。过去遇着很小的事情都要召开大会的毛病纠正了。党的一切主张、决议，经过这个核心都可以贯彻下去。\n　　　　　　【新华社西北二日电】"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. After the US New York Herald Tribune published an editorial calling for \"replacing\" Chiang Kai-shek as \"leader,\" the Chiang Kai-shek clique was very flustered. Because the situation was urgent, Dong Xian Guang had to hold a press conference in Nanjing on the 24th, trying hard to argue that the New York Herald Tribune's claim that Chiang Kai-shek's \"prestige has declined day by day\" was a \"misunderstanding.\" However, Dong Xian Guang failed to convince the American reporters, nor did he convince Chiang Kai-shek's own \"officials.\" On the same day as Dong Xian Guang's speech, the Associated Press sent a message from Nanjing saying: \"Despite Dong's argument, the vast majority of observers, including many Chinese officials, believe that the mass support for Chiang Kai-shek's government has been weakened by the unanimous attacks of its party members, especially members of the Legislative Yuan. Some officials describe this attack as a serious damage to the Kuomintang's unity during a critical period.\" According to American news agency reports: In the pseudo-Legislative Yuan meeting on the 14th of this month, Huang Yuren, a member of the Kuomintang's Fuxing faction, openly attacked Chiang Kai-shek for \"one person, one family monopolizing\" the Kuomintang government's military, foreign affairs, and politics, and shouted for Chiang to hand over \"government power.\" Another Kuomintang legislator named Liu Butong attacked Chiang Kai-shek for having \"turned the Kuomintang into a party controlled by dictatorship,\" claiming: \"Kuomintang members are increasingly dissatisfied with the few people headed by Chiang Kai-shek who rule the Kuomintang.\" This shows that the Chiang family court is approaching the day of collapse under the powerful hammer blows of the People's Liberation Army. Its American masters have repeatedly released remarks about abandoning the Chiang Kai-shek clique, making the Chiang Kai-shek clique even more chaotic internally.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美放出抛弃蒋介石言论后　蒋家集团更加混乱\n\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美放出抛弃蒋介石言论后\n    蒋家集团更加混乱\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】美国纽约先驱论坛报发表要“换”蒋介石这个“领导”的社论后，蒋介石集团内部甚为慌张。因为情势紧迫董显光乃不得不于廿四日在南京举行记者招待会，极力辩解纽约先驱论坛报所称蒋介石“威信已与日俱减”为一种“误解”。但董显光并未能说服美国记者，也未能说服蒋介石自己的“官员”。就在董显光谈话的当天，美联社从南京发出消息说：“尽管董有此论调，但绝大多数观察家包括许多中国官员在内都相信，蒋介石政府的群众支持已因其党员尤其是立法院中的党员的一致攻击而削弱，若干官员形容这种攻击为严重危机期间国民党统一的严重损毁”。按据美国通讯社消息：在本月十四日的伪立法院会议中，国民党复兴系分子黄宇人曾公开攻击蒋介石“一个人，一个家族垄断”了国民党政府的事军、外交、政治，高呼要蒋交出“政府权力”。另一叫刘不同的国民党立委则攻击蒋介石已把国民党“变为一个被独裁控制的党”，声称：“国民党员们已愈来愈不满意以蒋介石为首的统治国民党的少数人”。这表示蒋家朝廷在人民解放军的有力捶击之下，已接近树倒猢狲散的日子，其美国主子一再放出抛弃蒋介石集团的言论，使蒋介石集团内部更加混乱。"

This year's autumn weeding is more meticulous and cleaner than in previous years, which has greatly satisfied the masses. Weeding began in early June, and by the 15th, most of it was completed. Before the weeding began, the village took advantage of the rainy downtime to hold meetings in each street, explaining the Taihang District Party Committee's letter to farmers, cadres, and party members, dispelling various ideological concerns, and mobilizing people to compensate for the rough spring plowing and insufficient fertilization by doing a good job of weeding the autumn seedlings. The village chief first apologized to the masses for his work style: \"It was wrong of me to force the masses to dig the land at night last year. This year, we will definitely change this approach when organizing mutual aid production.\" Some cadres apologized for forcibly merging small groups of four or five households into large groups last year, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some said, \"There are too many people in the large mutual aid groups, and there is no chance to work for oneself. Some people still haven't received their wages from last year.\" Some cadres apologized for focusing on speed rather than quality in leading production last year, saying that if it was said to be completed in half a month, they always had to rush to finish it in ten days. After many autumn stubble fields were dug, the stubble was still there. Someone said: Last year, when mutual aid was expanded, people with children could not go to the fields with adults and could not learn how to cultivate seeds, and the children were all spoiled. Women had to pay more wages if they couldn't go to the fields, so they felt that mutual aid was not worthwhile. After the self-criticism, the village cleared last year's wages in each group, and at the same time, let the masses reorganize mutual aid voluntarily, with cadres and active elements in production as the core, forming groups at will, regardless of size. During weeding, each group worked according to the specific situation, and there was no longer any forced deadline, which greatly satisfied the masses. Most of the mutual aid groups in Zhongnan Street had collapsed in the past, but this time they voluntarily reunited, and the weeding was very good and fast. Many children (semi-laborers) and women in the village participated in weeding and seedling pulling, and the masses felt that \"the whole family is working hard.\" Even the old widow Ge Dui, who is over fifty years old, has weeded her more than three mu of land. The masses said, \"This year, no one is giving us a deadline, so we can weed properly.\"\n　　　　　　\n　(Zhao Chunxi)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 自愿结组按具体情况做活　八义锄苗又好又快\n赵春喜\n1948-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　自愿结组按具体情况做活\n    八义锄苗又好又快\n    【太行讯】长治五区八义镇改变了领导生产中追求形式与强迫命令作风，今年秋苗锄得比往年精细、干净，群众都很满意。锄苗从六月初开始，至十五日，大部都已锄完。该村在锄苗开始前即乘下雨的闲暇时候，分街开会，讲解太行区党委告农民、干部、党员书，解除各种思想顾虑，发动以好好锄苗来弥补春耕粗糙与上粪不足的缺陷。村长首先向群众检讨自己的作风：“去年强迫群众黑夜掘地，就是咱的不对，今年组织互助生产，一定改变这种作法。”有的干部检讨去年把四、五户以下的小组强制合并成大组，引起群众不满。有的说：“大互助人太多，轮不上给自己做活。有的去年工资，今年还要不了。”有的干部检讨去年领导生产光图快，不图好，说的半月完成，总要十天赶完。好多秋茬地掘过以后，茬子还在。有人说：去年扩大互助，人家有孩子不能跟着大人上地，学不会养种，孩子都荒唐坏啦。妇女不能上地得多出工资，所以觉得互助不上算。检讨后，一面在各组清理去年工资，一面放手由群众自愿重整互助，以干部及生产中的积极分子为核心，随意结组，大小不拘。锄苗时各组按情况做活，不再强迫限期完成，群众都很满意。中南街大部互助组过去都已垮台，这次又自愿结合起来，锄得很好也很快。村里有很多小孩（半劳力）和妇女都参加了锄苗、拔苗，群众觉得“全家满吃劲。”连五十多岁的老寡妇圪堆老婆也把自己三亩多地锄好了。群众说：“今年没人给咱限期，咱就能好好锄了。”　　　　　　\n　（赵春喜）"

    "content": "[North Yue] The leadership organs of Huolu's Eighth District and Qiu County's Li Village area in the Seventh District discovered locust nymphs on the 28th of this month. The situation is most serious in more than ten villages, including Hengshan, Shangzhuang, Dachexing, and Da Xiaolou. The area of grain seedlings in Hengshan Village damaged by locust nymphs accounts for about two-fifths of the entire village. The locust nymphs started as small as wheat grains, grew larger overnight, and quickly developed wings, flying everywhere. Generally, they develop from mountainous areas towards plains. In the locust-affected areas, each village has established a locust-catching headquarters under the Farmers' Association. All villagers, regardless of gender, who are ten years old or older, are locust-catching team members. Every hundred people form a team, and each team is divided into three squads, each equipped with scouts and liaisons. County and district cadres went to each village to supervise and inspect. The entire county has set up a general headquarters, with County Chief Xie personally serving as the general commander of locust catching. In the past few days, many people have participated in locust catching, and the emancipated peasants have played a key role. Wang Shuanggui of Xinzhuang did not sleep for two nights, and some even forgot to eat, putting all their efforts into suppression. It is estimated that all locusts in the county can be completely eliminated within three or four days. Three methods of locust catching have been created: encirclement, sweeping, and variation. The encirclement method is to encircle the areas with more locust nymphs, scatter a piece of wheat straw in the middle, and insert flags as targets. The team members around move towards the target, gradually shrinking the encirclement. Finally, when the locusts all burrow into the wheat straw, light a fire to burn the locusts to death. The sweeping method is used in areas with larger areas and fewer locust nymphs. The entire team members are arranged in a horizontal line and move forward, hitting and eliminating one at a time. The variation method is a mixed application of the above two methods, that is, in the process of sweeping forward, when encountering areas with more concentrated locust nymphs, the scouts insert flags as a signal to change the formation. Depending on the size of the land, part or all of the team is divided to encircle and annihilate them. Burning locust nymphs to death is the best way to eliminate them. If the locust nymphs are buried in the soil, they will slowly crawl out. (Qi Minglu, Zhi Ting, Lü Mingrui)\n\n[Jinan News] Locust nymphs were discovered in some areas of Qiu County, Yongnian, and Daming Counties. Local county and district leadership organs led the masses to quickly capture and eradicate them. Many locust nymphs were simultaneously discovered in the northwest of Hengzhuang Village in the Third District of Qiu County, the east of Li'erzhuang Village in the Fourth District, and the south of Nielou Village on May 29th. The small seedlings that were eaten up or eaten into flower leaves covered about five to six hundred acres. Upon hearing the news, the County Committee immediately organized more than 10,000 people from the Third and Fourth Districts to repeatedly capture and beat them. Most of the locust nymphs have now been eliminated. A large number of flying locusts were found in the reed wasteland with an area of about 50 acres inside the embankment surrounding the southeastern suburbs of Yongnian City. The county chief of the county led all the cadres of the First District and the masses of more than a dozen nearby villages to capture and beat them. On June 12th, four or five patches of locust nymphs were found in the western area of Mazhuang, east of Wantidi in Daming, each patch about one acre in size. District cadres immediately mobilized 130 people to go to capture and beat them. Locust nymphs were also found in the southwest of Mantun Village in the Fourth District of Fudong. The government organized the masses to eliminate them on the one hand, and notified the production committees of each village to conduct inspections everywhere so as to discover them at any time and then eliminate them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 获鹿邱县县区领导机关　组织群众捕灭蝗蝻\n\n1948-07-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　获鹿邱县县区领导机关\n    组织群众捕灭蝗蝻\n    【北岳】获鹿八区大部村庄和七区李家庄一带，于本月二十八日发现蝗蝻。横山、上庄、大车行、大小楼等十余村最为严重。横山村被蝗蝻遭害的谷苗面积，约占全村五分之二。蝗蝻开始只有麦粒那么小，经过一晚上就大些了，很快的长起翅来，遍飞各地。一般是由山地向平川发展。在蝗灾区，各村都在农会下设立捕蝗指挥部，全村不论男女，凡年满十岁者，皆为捕蝗队员，每百人为一队，每队又分三个分队，各队配有侦察和连络员。县区干部分赴各村督促检查。全县设总指挥部，由谢县长亲任捕蝗总指挥。几天来参加捕蝗的人很多，翻身农民起了骨干作用，辛庄王双贵两夜没睡觉，有的连饭也顾不得吃，全力进剿。估计全县蝗虫三、四天内即可全部扑灭。捕蝗办法已创造有包围式，一扫光，变化式三种。包围式是将蝗蝻较多的地方，四面包围起来，当中散一片麦秸；插旗为目标，四周队员向目标前进，包围圈逐渐缩小，最后蝗虫都钻进麦秸里时，点起火来，将蝗虫烧死。一扫光是在面积较大，蝗蝻较少的地方，把全体队员排成一字横队前进，一面行一面打，见一个消灭一个。变化式是上面两种方式的混合施用，即在一扫光的前进中，遇到蝗蝻较集中的地方，即由侦察员插旗为号，变化队形，看地片的大小，分出一部或全部包围歼灭。消灭蝗蝻烧死最好。如果把蝗蝻埋在土里，它会慢慢钻出来。　　　　　　　　　　　　（郄名禄、致庭、吕明瑞）\n    【冀南讯】邱县、永年、大名等县部分地区发现蝗蝻，当地县区领导机关率领群众，迅速予以捕灭。邱县三区恒庄村西北，四区里二庄村东、聂楼村南于五月二十九日同时发现蝗蝻甚多，小苗被吃光与吃成花叶的，约有五、六百亩。县委会闻讯，立即组织起三、四区万余群众，反复进行捕打，现蝗蝻大部已被消灭。永年城东南郊围城堤内，约有五十亩面积的芦苇荒地里，发现飞蝗甚多。该县县长当则率领一区全体干部及附近十余村群众进行捕打。大名万堤以东，马庄西部地区于六月十二日发现蝗蝻四、五片，每片约有一亩大，区干立即动员群众一百三十人前往捕打。阜东四区满屯村西南也发现蝗蝻，政府一面组织群众扑灭，一面通知各村生产委员会，到处进行检查，以便随时发现，随即捕灭。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th – The news of the People’s Liberation Army capturing Kaifeng has rapidly shaken the financial and commodity markets in Shanghai. U.S. dollars, gold, stocks, rice, and other commodities have all surged in price. According to reports from various foreign news agencies: on the 24th, rice was 15 million (Chiang currency – same below) per dan (unit of weight), on the 25th it had already risen to 17 million per dan, and there was a price but no market. On the 26th, it soared to an astounding 23 million per dan. This is a 22-fold increase compared to the beginning of the year’s 1 million per dan, and about a three-fold increase compared to the beginning of the month’s 6 million per dan. Some other commodities increased by 50% in a single day on the 25th. In the black market, U.S. dollars were 2.6 million Chiang currency per dollar on the 22nd, rising to 2.9 million on the 24th, opening at 3.4 million on the morning of the 25th, and breaking through 4 million that night, soaring to a peak of 5 million on the 26th, a more than 30-fold increase compared to the beginning of the year’s 160,000, and about a four-fold increase compared to the beginning of the month’s 1.05 million. The gold price surge also kept pace with the U.S. dollar, reaching 200 million per tael on the 25th, an increase of 50 million in a single day compared to the 24th. The Shanghai market is now in a state of panic and chaos, \"Housewives are frantically selling the rapidly devaluing legal tender (Chiang currency) in their hands, exchanging it for household necessities. Merchants and speculators are scrambling to buy stocks. By noon on the 25th, all stocks had risen to the limit, and stock trading was suspended as a result\" (Reuters). \"The rapid inflation has made the cost of buying goods rise faster than the selling price, making it unprofitable to trade goods. Some stores have not opened, and shopkeepers try to ask for foreign currency when selling goods, whenever possible\" (Associated Press).\n\nAccording to a report by United Press, the Nanjing market also fell into chaos on the 25th. Most shops closed their doors tightly in the evening to cope with people's panic buying. General commodity prices rose by 10 to 15 percent compared with the previous two days. Paper rose most sharply, about 30 percent, followed by cotton, cloth, soap, rice and flour.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the primary reason for the increasingly intense economic storm in the Chiang-controlled areas, which began on the 5th of this month, is due to “the continuous stream of unfavorable news from the front lines of the civil war, especially the fall of Kaifeng.” Another factor is the endless vicious expansion of Chiang currency. According to a report in the Chiang Party's army newspaper, Peace Daily, on the 24th, 500,000 and 1 million large denomination bills will be circulated at the beginning of next month. This news immediately affected the market. A United Press reporter quoted the opinion of a Shanghai \"banking authority\" that the price surge on the 25th was \"because all the news - military, political, and economic - is very bad.\" The same person also said: \"No one knows what will happen in the future, because things have reached a point of 'uncontrollable'.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th – According to various reports, commodity prices in major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas have continued to soar since the middle of this month. In Changchun, which was plundered by the Chiang Party, there is a severe shortage of food and skyrocketing prices, \"even the price of tree leaves has risen to 200,000 Chiang currency per pound\" (United Press Shanghai, 19th). The citizens of Changchun, who are suffering from hunger, have recently launched \"several anti-hunger demonstrations, demanding that the food stockpiled by the rich be distributed to the poor\" (Associated Press, Beiping, 28th, quoting the Chiang Party's Tianjin Republican Daily). According to news from newspapers in the Chiang-controlled areas, prices in Tianjin and Beiping are still continuing to soar. In Tianjin, corn flour doubled on the 16th, rising to 50,000 per catty (unit of weight). On the morning of the 18th, Wanshoushan brand flour in Beiping broke through 6 million per bag, and rose to 6.6 million in the afternoon, an increase of 1 million compared to the 17th. On the same day, when Shanghai rice was still 10 million per dan, Beiping rice had already sold for 200,000 per catty (that is, 20 million per dan). According to an Associated Press report, the black market for U.S. dollars in Beiping had risen to 4 million Chiang currency per dollar on the 27th, and in Tianjin it was at least 5 million. The price increase in Qingdao is also very alarming. On June 3rd, U.S. dollars were 1.2 million, and on the 15th, they reached 2 million. Shuanglong fine cloth was only 700,000 per bolt on the 1st, and on the 15th it rose to 11.8 million, an increase of 16 times. By the middle of the month, all commodities had risen by more than 80 percent in half a month. In Xiamen, Fujian, rice had risen to 21 million per dan on the 23rd of this month, and in Fuzhou it had risen to 22 million. Prices in Guangzhou are rising faster than in Shanghai. According to a United Press Shanghai report on the 24th, the Guangdong Kuomintang Senate pointed out, while fiercely criticizing Soong Tzu-wen's malpractices, that \"Guangzhou has replaced Shanghai in leading the rise in prices.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区市场一片混乱　沪米涨到二千三百万　各大城市物价无不狂涨\n\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区市场一片混乱\n    沪米涨到二千三百万\n    各大城市物价无不狂涨\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】人民解放军攻下开封的消息，迅速震撼上海金融物价市场。美钞、黄金、股票、大米及其他物价，无不狂涨。综合各外国通讯社报导：二十四日大米每担为一千五百万元（蒋币——下同），廿五日已涨为一千七百万元，且有价无市。二十六日更涨到每担二千三百万元的惊人记录。即较年初的每担一百万元涨了二十二倍，较月初的每担六百万元涨了约三倍。其他商品有些在二十五日一天之内就上涨了百分之五十。美钞黑市，二十二日每一美元为二百六十万蒋币，二十四日涨至二百九十万，二十五日晨间开盘为三百四十万，入夜即突破四百万元，二十六日更一度涨到五百万元高峰，较年初的十六万元上涨了三十倍强，较月初的一百零五万上涨了约四倍。黄金涨风亦与美钞齐头并进，二十五日每两已涨至两亿元，较二十四日，一日之间即上涨五千万元。现上海市场一片惊惶与混乱，“主妇们慌乱抛售手中迅速贬值的法币（蒋币），换成家用必需品。商人和投机者则争相购买股票，二十五日中午，一切股票皆涨到停板，股票交易曾因之停顿”（路透社）。“飞速的通货膨胀，使买进货物的成本，涨得比卖价还快，已使得买卖商品无利可图。有一些商店就没有开门，店主出卖货物时，只要可能就试要外币”（美联社）。\n    又据合众社报导：二十五日南京市场亦曾陷于混乱，大多数商店都于傍晚紧关铺门，以对付人们的抢购，一般物价都较前两日上涨百分之十到十五，以纸张上涨最烈，约达百分之三十，其次为棉花、布匹、肥皂、大米与面粉。\n    本月五日开始的蒋区六月经济风暴近日更加猛烈的首要原因，据路透社称：系由“内战前线上不断传来的失利消息，特别是开封的陷落”。另一因素则为蒋币无止境的恶性膨胀。据蒋党陆军机关报和平日报二十四日载称：五十万元与一百万元大钞，将于下月初流通，该项消息立即影响市场。合众社记者引某上海“银行界权威人士”的意见，认为二十五日的物价狂涨，“是因为一切消息——军事的、政治的和经济的，都很坏”。同一人士并说：“谁都不知道以后会发生什么事情，因为事情已到‘无法控制’的地步了。”\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】据各方报导：本月中旬以来，蒋区各大城市物价均继续狂涨。蒋党搜括掠夺下的长春，粮食奇缺，物价暴涨，“甚至树叶价格亦已涨到每磅卖二十余万元蒋币”（合众社上海十九日电）。被饥火煎迫的长春市民，最近已掀起“若干次反饥饿示威，要求将富人囤积的粮食分配给穷人”（美联社北平二十八日电引蒋党天津民国日报消息）。另据蒋区报纸消息：平津各地物价仍在继续暴涨中，津市棒子面十六日上涨一倍，每斤已涨到五万元。十八日晨北平万寿山牌面粉每袋已冲破六百万元，下午更涨到六百六十万元，比十七日涨一百万。同日当上海米价尚为每担一千万时，北平大米即已卖到二十万一斤（即每担二千万元）。据美联社报导：二十七日北平美钞黑市已涨到每元合蒋币四百万元，天津则至少要五百万元。青岛物价上涨亦很惊人，六月三日美钞为一百二十万，十五日即达二百万。双龙细布一日仅七十万一匹，十五日即上涨到一千一百八十万元，上涨十六倍之多。至中旬止，半个月内各物均上涨百分之八十以上。福建的厦门，本月二十三日大米每担已涨到二千一百万元，福州更涨达二千二百万元。广州物价涨得比上海还高。据合众社上海二十四日报导，广东国民党参议会在猛烈抨击宋子文的恶政时指出：“广州已代替上海而领导物价上涨”。"

    "content": "Yubei Military and Civilians Capture Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Spies\n\n　　[Dispatch from this Newspaper] Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in northern Henan have continuously dispatched small groups of armed special agents to lurk in our border areas, attempting to carry out disintegration and sabotage activities, scout out military intelligence, and secretly threaten the masses to demand grain and money. Our battalion soldiers and militia, closely integrated with the masses, have actively launched a rigorous capture campaign. In Xiuwu, Ye County and other places, twenty plainclothes armed special agents have been captured successively. On the night of the 13th of this month, Chang Lanting, the captain of the 8th squadron of the puppet Wuzhi Security Regiment, dispatched his so-called \"elite\" special agent squad of ten men, combined with two enemy intelligence officers, to lurk in Gu Fan Village, the second district of Wuzhi, attempting to disintegrate the militia of our five villages, shoot our grassroots cadres in the dark, and threaten the masses to deliver grain and cloth. They failed to act on the 14th night, and were discovered by us on the morning of the 15th. The Xiuwu battalion soldiers immediately cooperated with the militia to search, and except for one person who escaped, all were captured. A total of nine special agents, including squad leader Zhao Nianshang, were captured alive, and six rifles, one American submachine gun, three pistols, more than 600 rounds of ammunition, and ten hand grenades were seized. The Xiuwu battalion soldiers also captured an enemy plainclothes special agent. It is said that recently, dozens of plainclothes special agents have been sent from the enemy strongholds of Jiaozuo Lifeng and Songcun, etc., disguised as coal merchants returning to their hometowns or feigning surrender, to gather our military intelligence. The armed work teams in various districts of Ye County have also captured many enemy plainclothes special agents. On the 14th of this month, a plainclothes special agent of the stubborn bandit Wang Ziquan's troops, disguised as a commoner, came to Cuijiaqiao Village to scout, and was recognized by the masses and arrested by our fourth district armed work team. On the same day, another enemy plainclothes agent was captured in Caoma. The armed work team of the second district disguised themselves, went deep into the enemy's rear, and lived with the masses. In eight days from May 28 to June 4, they captured five enemy plainclothes agents and killed two. The enemy Li Guobiao plainclothes team often fired in the dark in the Jurenwa area, which the masses hated very much. On the 18th of this month, five enemy plainclothes agents came to Jurenwa to carry out activities again, and our armed work team immediately captured three alive, seizing three pistols, fourteen bullets, and four hand grenades.\n\n　　[Another Dispatch] During the wheat protection campaign in northern Henan, the morale of the stubborn bandit army is declining day by day under the combined offensive of our military and political forces. Often, as soon as the gunfire starts, they flee for their lives. During the Conggu battle east of Anyang, after our army launched a general offensive against the 117th Regiment of the enemy 40th Division, most of the soldiers fled without firing a shot. After the battle, more than half of the soldiers of that regiment deserted. In Xiaotun Village east of Anyang alone, seven young men who had been forcibly drafted into the regiment fled back overnight. During the Lijiashan battle, as soon as the soldiers of Wang Ziquan's bandit troops heard the gunfire, they turned around and ran. Some simply lay down and surrendered. North of Dingguo Temple, an enemy soldier was desperately trying to escape. When a soldier of our company shouted to surrender his gun, he immediately stopped, turned his hat around, raised his gun and said, \"I understand your policy on prisoners.\" He obediently surrendered his gun. Two soldiers, while we were pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy, even turned their guns and shot at the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops with us. The wounded Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers, when our medical personnel changed their dressings, earnestly requested to be carried to the Liberated Army and not to return to Anyang to die. After Company × captured a heavy machine gun, there was no one to carry it, and several Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had laid down their arms carried it back.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Du Ming)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北军民捕捉蒋匪特务\n杜明\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北军民捕捉蒋匪特务\n    【本行讯】豫北蒋匪近日不断派出小股特务武装，潜伏我边沿区，企图进行瓦解破坏、侦探军情，并暗地威胁群众，逼要粮款。我营兵民兵密切结合群众，积极展开严密的捕捉战，修获武、邺县等地先后已捕获便衣武装特务二十名。本月十三日夜，伪武陟保安团第八中队队长常兰亭，派出其所谓“精干的”特务班十名，结合敌情报员两名，潜伏于武陟二区古樊村，企图瓦解我五个村的民兵、及打我基点干部黑枪，威胁群众送粮送布。十四夜未能下手，十五日上午被我发觉，修获武营兵立即配合民兵前去搜查，除一人逃跑外，全部落网。计活捉特务班长赵年上以下九名，缴获步枪六支，美式冲锋机枪一挺，手枪三支，子弹六百余发，手榴弹十个。修武营兵亦捕捉敌便衣特务一名。据称：近日焦作李封、宋村等敌据点，派出数十名便衣特务，伪装买煤商人返乡或假投降，刺探我方军情。邺县各区武工队亦捕捉了敌便衣特务多名。本月十四日顽匪王自全部一便衣特务，伪装老百姓到崔家桥村侦探，当被群众识破，由我四区武工队逮捕。同日又在曹马捕捉敌便衣一名。二区武工队化装深入敌后，和群众生活在一起，在五月二十八至六月四日八天内捉敌便衣五名，打死两名。敌李国标便衣队经常在举人洼一带打黑枪，群众异常痛恨，本月十八日敌便衣五名又到举人洼活动，我武工队当即活捉三名，缴获手枪三支，子弹十四粒，手榴弹四个。\n    【又讯】豫北保麦战中，顽匪军在我军事与政治结合的攻势下，士气日益低落。常常枪声一响，即纷纷各自逃命。安阳东从固战斗时，敌四十师一一七团在我军发动总攻后，大部士兵不放枪即行溃逃。战斗后，该团士兵逃亡过半。仅安阳东小屯村被抓去编入该团的壮丁，一夜即逃回七个。李家山战斗时，王自全匪部士兵一听枪响，掉头就跑。有的干脆伏着就擒。在定国寺北，一个敌兵正拼命逃跑，我某连战士一喊缴枪，他立即站住，倒转帽，举过枪说：“我懂得你们的俘虏政策。”驯服的缴了枪。有两个士兵在我追歼逃敌时，曾掉过枪口和我一块射击溃逃的蒋顽匪军。负伤的蒋顽匪军士兵，在我军卫生员给换药时，都恳切要求把他们抬到解放军来，死不回安阳。×连在缴获重机枪后，没人抬，几个放下武器的蒋军就给抬回来。　　　　　　　　　　\n　　　　　　　　（杜明）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 30th -- During the Northwest People's Liberation Army's advance into the Jingwei region of central Shaanxi in late April, the local Chiang Kai-shek officials were panicked and behaved deplorably. Jin Bingjia, the Kuomintang magistrate of Gouyi County, was ridiculed by the local people as \"Chief Jin Bao\" because his \"government orders\" did not extend beyond two miles outside the city. On April 17th, when we attacked Gouyi, \"Chief Jin Bao\" hid in the seven-story high tower in the east of the city. After our artillery fire broke the staircase in the middle of the tower, \"Chief Jin Bao\" begged our army to rescue him from the tower. When our soldiers brought a ladder to call him down, the obese \"Chief Jin Bao\" was so frightened that his legs went weak and he was unable to descend. Our soldiers had to climb the tower and use ropes to lower him down. On April 18th, after our army annihilated the Third Regiment of the Youth Army 203rd Division in Changning Town, Yongshou, Li Tongde, the Kuomintang magistrate of Yongshou, hastily led more than a hundred people to abandon the city and flee for their lives, only to be completely annihilated by our army in Diantou Town, southwest of the county, on the 21st. Wang Xu, the magistrate of Fufeng County, had already tightly closed the city gates before our army arrived. On April 21st, when our army arrived, Wang and his subordinates fled for their lives. Wang Zhonghe, a section chief who hadn't even put on his clothes properly, was captured alive by our army as soon as he jumped off the city wall. The soldiers asked him, \"Where is the magistrate?\" He said, \"I didn't see him. Everyone is escaping on their own, no one can take care of anyone else.\" A certain magistrate Lan of Qishan County fled outside the city before our army arrived. On the night of April 23rd, it rained, and they thought our army would not come, so they sent a part of the security police team back to the city to guard it. But as soon as our army arrived, the security police team abandoned the city and fled without firing a single shot. Under the shock of our army's offensive, Shu Yaojiang, the magistrate of Chongxin County, forcibly pulled more than ten head of livestock and first sent his wife, children, and plundered property to Pingliang. His finance section chief, Xu, and others followed suit and moved their families one after another. Coincidentally, the People's Liberation Army did not go there for the next few days, so they thought, \"Our small county is not on a major road, so they probably won't come.\" But on the night of May 3rd, when a part of the People's Liberation Army passed through the city, they immediately abandoned the city and fled west overnight. Before the liberation of Baoji, Chiang's personnel were transporting their families and personal belongings to Hanzhong day and night. Commissioner Sun Zongfu had already fled before our army arrived.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 躲藏、逃命　泾渭之役蒋官员丑态百出\n\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　躲藏、逃命　泾渭之役蒋官员丑态百出\n    【新华社西北三十日电】西北人民解放军于四月底挺进陕中泾渭地区作战，该地蒋方官员惊慌万状，丑态百出。蒋记枸邑县长金炳嘉，因其“政令”不出城郊二里，当地群众讥称他为“金保长”。四月十七日我攻枸邑时，“金保长”躲在城东七层高塔上，恰在该塔中层楼梯被我炮兵击断后，“金保长”乃乞求我军援救下塔。我军战士找了梯子前去叫他下来时，肥胖的“金保长”吓的两腿酸软，无力下梯，经我军战士上塔才用绳子将他吊下来。四月十八日我军在永寿常宁镇消灭青年军二○三师第三团后，永寿蒋记县长李同德急率百余人弃城逃命，二十一日被我军在该县西南之店头镇全部消灭。扶风县长王绪于我军到达前即紧闭城门，四月二十一日我军到达后，王及其僚属即各自逃命。衣服都没有穿好的科长王忠和，刚刚跳下城墙，即为我军活捉，战士们问他：“县长在哪里？”他说：“没有见到，各人逃各人的，谁也顾不了谁。”岐山县长兰某在我军到达前即逃往城外。四月二十三日夜雨，他们以为我军不会来，又派一部保警队回城看守。但我军一到，保警队一枪未发，即弃城逃命。崇信县长舒耀江在我军攻势震惊下，强拉牲口十余头，首先将其老婆孩子及搜刮而来的财物送往平凉，其财政科长徐某等亦上行下效，相继搬家。恰巧以后几天，解放军并未去那里，他们即以为：“咱们小县，不通大路，大概不会来了。”但五月三日夜解放军一部路过该城时，他们立即连夜弃城西逃。宝鸡解放前，蒋方人员日夜迁运家眷及私人财物到汉中，专员孙宗复在我军到达前即已逃走。"

    "content": "Remembering the Battle of Baoji\n\nThe first liberation of Baoji City, a vital military and industrial city in the Northwest, by the Northwest People's Liberation Army, once again proved the futility of Hu Zongnan's fortified cities on the Northwest battlefield.\n\nThe towering Panlong Mountain to the east of the city was the enemy's solid protective position for defending Baoji. Forts were built on the mountain, surrounded by outer trenches and barbed wire. On the afternoon of April 25th, our battle to capture the forts began. The blasting operation successfully completed its task. With a loud bang, the fort gate was blown open. Fifteen minutes later, our army annihilated the enemy defenders of the fort, completely controlled Panlong Mountain, and continued to advance towards Dongguan.\n\nAnother unit of our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy's position at Jintai Pass in the northeast of the city. After a sharpshooter destroyed several of the enemy's main bunkers with four shots, the soldiers crawled through two layers of barbed wire and crossed trenches one foot deep and one foot wide to attack the enemy. One squad of the defending enemy immediately laid down their weapons. Another unit of our army rushed up from the left and right sides. Liberated soldier Li Xinyun jumped into an enemy-occupied courtyard alone and shouted, \"Don't be afraid, we used to be from the 61st Brigade, we were liberated in the Yichuan battle. The Liberation Army treats us very well. As long as you lay down your weapons, you will definitely not be killed.\" After his shout, all the enemy defenders in the courtyard stopped resisting and laid down their weapons.\n\nThe enemy built three lines of fortifications and more than forty large and small bunkers on the mountain behind the airport, guarded by a battalion. Our army took them all with three companies and advanced towards the county seat.\n\nIn the west of the city, a unit of our army moved along both sides of the railway and entered Xiguan. In less than an hour, they advanced to the bridgehead, more than ten meters from the city. The bridge was broken and impassable. Guo Richeng, the deputy platoon leader of a certain unit, examined the terrain three times and led a squad to jump down from the ten-foot-high bridgehead, using the dead angle under the city to move towards the corner of the city wall. The city wall was lower here and made of earth, so they quickly dug steps to climb the city wall, immediately killing two enemies. The remaining enemies, under the sudden attack of our brave warriors, laid down their weapons. The warriors went down the city and opened the city gate, and our follow-up troops surged in, advancing along the street and pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy.\n\nBy the afternoon of the 26th, all the enemy defenders in Baoji City were wiped out; only an armored train east of the station was still stubbornly resisting. Xu Bao, the commander of the enemy's 76th Division who was defending Baoji, was holed up in the armored train with a special service company, waiting for \"reinforcements.\" When our artillery shells continuously penetrated and exploded inside the train, the enemy tried to drive east to escape, but the rails in front had already been removed. Taking advantage of the gaps in the artillery bombardment, our brave warriors quickly climbed onto the roof of the train to blow up the carriages. The enemies inside the train hurriedly squeezed out to surrender their guns. Xu Bao was hit by a machine gun bullet inside the train and shouted, \"How powerful!\" Then he lay down on the bed and died of serious injuries. Thus, the Battle of Baoji came to a victorious conclusion.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 追记宝鸡之战\n\n1948-07-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　追记宝鸡之战\n    西北人民解放军对西北军事要地与工业城市宝鸡城的第一次解放战，在西北战场上又一次证明胡宗南设防城市之无用。\n    高耸城东的盘龙山是敌人保卫宝鸡的险固护城阵地，山上修有寨子，周围有外壕与铁丝网围护。四月二十五日下午，我攻夺寨子的战斗开始。爆破作业首先胜利地完成了任务，一声巨响，寨门被炸开了。十五分钟以后，我军就消灭了寨子的守敌，全部控制了盘龙山，继续向东关进逼。\n    另部我军向城东北金台关敌阵地展开猛攻，神炮手四发四中打垮了敌人几个主要地堡后，战士们便钻过两层铁丝网，越过深宽各一丈的壕堑向敌进攻。守敌中有一个班立即放下武器。我军另部由左右两侧冲上去。解放战士李新云单身跳进敌占院内喊话：“你们不要怕，我们原来是六十一旅的，宜川战斗才解放的，解放军对咱们很好，只要放下武器，绝对不杀。”经他一喊，院内守敌便全部停止抵抗，放下武器。\n    飞机场后山上敌人筑了三道工事和四十多个大小碉堡，由一个营守卫。我军以三个连兵力即将其全部拿下，并向县城进攻。\n    城西我军一部沿铁路两旁运动进入西关，不到一小时，即进至城下十余米达的桥头。该桥已断，不能通过。某部排副郭日成看了三次地形，便率领一个班跳下丈余高的桥头，利用城下死角地带向城墙拐角处运动。该处城墙较低，且系土质，因此很快挖了台阶登上城墙，立即打死两个敌人，其余敌人在我勇士突然猛击下均放下武器。勇士们下城打开城门，我后续部队乃锋拥而进，沿街进展，追歼溃敌。\n    二十六日下午，宝鸡城内守敌全被肃清；只有车站东面的一辆铁甲车还在顽抗。这里面就是防守宝鸡的敌七十六师师长徐保，他带着一个特务连龟缩在铁甲车内，困守待“援”。当我军炮弹连续穿入车厢内爆炸时，敌人想开车东逃，但前面的铁轨早已搬掉了。我军勇士们乘炮弹轰击的间隙，迅速爬上车顶进行爆破车厢，车内敌人连忙挤出来缴枪投降。徐保在车内中了机枪弹，叫了一声“好厉害！”以后，便卧倒床上，伤重毙命。至此宝鸡之战遂胜利结束。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社西北二十九日电】"

The village has a total of 202 households and 3,037 mu of land, with a total burden score of 3,539 points last year. The previous village finance director was a landlord who did not serve the people well. Other village cadres also spent village funds casually, and the leadership did not supervise adequately, resulting in serious waste in village financial expenditures. From January to November of last year, according to incomplete statistics, the village cadres' meeting meal expenses (at restaurants) amounted to 3.81 million yuan (border currency, same below). Seven support-the-front trips (each with four or five people) cost 3.8 million yuan in pocket money alone. During the army expansion, soldiers were hired in disguise, costing eight shi of corn per person, plus 50,000 yuan. Before leaving, they also spent 2.3 million yuan in the village. Including other village burdens, each point was assessed 41 jin of corn. This not only increased the difficulties in the people's lives but also greatly affected their enthusiasm for production. Since the start of the land reform, bad cadres have been replaced, and the masses' awareness has been raised. Systems have been established, and village financial expenditures have been greatly reduced. From November of last year to February of this year, the total expenditure for office expenses and teachers' salaries in four months was 3,942,960 yuan, with each point equivalent to 1,500 yuan. In the management of village finances, the masses publicly elected the Farmers' Association Director as the finance director, with five committee members. All expenditures in the village must be approved by them. A list is posted monthly and announced at mass meetings, allowing the masses to check at any time. Waste has been reduced, the people's burden has been lightened, and the broad masses are very supportive. Middle peasant Liu Zhenquan said, \"This is great, and we have more energy to work.

    "content": "Jiluyu Regional Party Committee's Emergency Directive\n    Combine Production and Flood Control\n    [Jiluyu News] With the Yellow River's high-water season approaching, the Jiluyu Regional Party Committee has issued an emergency directive regarding flood control work to \"ensure the Yellow River embankment is not breached.\" The directive calls for combining flood control with production and organizing forces to repair the dikes as much as possible. The directive states: \"Completing this year's flood control work is one of the most important tasks for our Party, government, army, and people along the Yellow River. Due to the seesaw battles on the south bank, the enemy has repeatedly damaged the Yellow River dikes, resulting in significant consumption of our manpower and resources, while the dangerous sections and dikes have not been properly repaired. Regarding the water situation, although we have equipment, the fluctuating water levels make it difficult to take the initiative. Moreover, the newly repaired dikes are not yet solid enough, especially in the sections controlled by the enemy, where dangerous sections and dikes have not been restored. Under these circumstances, ensuring that both banks are not breached and protecting the people's interests is a task that our Party, government, and people cannot neglect. The slightest carelessness could lead to a breach. To ensure the completion of the task, it has been decided that this year's flood control policy will be 'phased, sectional, and focused defense,' overcoming formalism and generalization. The Party committees, governments, and repair departments along the Yellow River should conduct meticulous organization based on this spirit and establish strong command organs at all levels, paying particular attention to combining flood control with production. To ensure a reasonable labor burden, it has been decided that flood control villages will not be assigned combat support tasks during the flood season, avoiding the dispersion of forces. In newly liberated areas, necessary armed forces must be dispatched to provide cover based on the situation. The flood season begins on July 7th this year. After receiving this directive, Party committees and governments at all levels must complete all preparatory work before the flood season and must not neglect this. During the flood season, responsible personnel at all levels of the government along the river must personally inspect the dikes. When the water situation is critical, county and district chiefs, and section chiefs must also go to the dikes to supervise and carry out various flood control tasks to ensure the completion of the major task of 'ensuring the Yellow River embankment is not breached.' If any section is lost due to negligence in flood control work, the local leaders along the river will be fully responsible to the people.\"\n    [Jiluyu News] As we are urgently repairing the Yellow River dikes on the south bank, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are dispatching light and heavy bombers to strafe and bomb day and night, destroying the dike restoration project. On the 2nd of this month, three Chiang Kai-shek planes strafed back and forth over Li Jinshi Hall in the Juancheng section, wounding one of our dike restoration workers from the first district.

    "content": "Newly Liberated Kaifeng City\n    Crowds Surround Our Army's Proclamations; Shopkeepers Sweep Streets and Reopen for Business\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, 24th Dispatch] (Delayed) A frontline reporter reports on the situation during the liberation of Kaifeng, stating: The reporter entered the southern gate of Kaifeng city from the airport. On the broad, flat airfield stood a transport plane, and nearby were many wrecked fuselages. Looking north from the airport towards Kaifeng city, dense green forests were still emitting plumes of black smoke. The Flour Company building was burned down to its tall skeleton; most of South Gate Street was destroyed; residual smoke remained in the fire zone inside and outside the South Gate. Liberation Army soldiers were assisting groups of residents in pouring water to put out the fire. Red Cross personnel, with towels covering their mouths and cotton stuffed in their nostrils, followed Liberation Army soldiers as they carried the corpses of Chiang's soldiers from the rubble. The area from Zhongshan Road to Madao Street, Gulou Street, and Bookstore Street was originally the city's commercial center, with tall Western-style buildings lining the wide roads, and lush green trees planted along the sidewalks. But now it is a scene of devastation. The Gulou and Madao Street areas were looted and set on fire by the defeated Chiang's troops. The top of the Gulou was burned down by incendiary bombs, and the Commercial Press building was bombed by Chiang's planes, leaving only a shell. And the original most lively place in the city – the Xiangguo Temple, a Song Dynasty building – was bombed, leaving only two stone lions and half a mud Buddha. The continuous frantic bombing by Chiang's planes and the arson and looting by Chiang's bandits before their annihilation in the past few days have caused terrible disasters for the people of Kaifeng.\n    On the same day the battle ended, the Liberation Army withdrew to the outskirts of the city, and the city was maintained by pickets wearing red cloth armbands at street corners. Some shops had notices posted outside by the Political Department of the Liberation Army Headquarters: \"Owner Absent, Entry Prohibited.\" Outside, pickets were guarding these unmanned shops. Many merchants had already returned from outside the city with their bags, and their faces showed surprise and joy when they saw this situation. Throughout the major streets and alleys of the city, proclamations of peace and various policy proclamations of the Political Department of the Liberation Army Headquarters were posted, and crowds gathered everywhere. In the evening, the streets became lively, and groups of uniformed male and female students, professors in suits, and merchants flocked to the Weixin Middle School and the two Xinhua bookstores at the south end of Madao Street to buy books and newspapers from the liberated areas and visit the photo exhibition of the People's Revolutionary War. Some shops on Zhongshan Road had already begun to operate. Liberation Army soldiers were carrying water to sprinkle on the dry and sandy roads, and shop assistants were also out sweeping the streets. Streamlined sedans captured by the Liberation Army and American-made ten-wheeled trucks drove continuously across the damp roads, and the crowds coming and going were endless. Although the enemy was still bombing and destroying, order was quickly being restored.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刚解放的开封市上　我军布告前围满观众店友扫街道开始营业\n\n1948-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刚解放的开封市上\n    我军布告前围满观众店友扫街道开始营业\n    【新华社开封前线二十四日电】（迟到）前线记者报导开封解放期间的情形称：记者由飞机场进入开封城南关。在广阔平坦的机场上，停着一架运输机，旁边还有很多打烂了的机身。从飞机场北望开封城，密密的绿林中仍在冒起一团团的黑烟。面粉公司大楼已烧得只剩了高大的骨架；南关大街大部被毁；南门内外的火灾区仍有残烟，解放军战士正协助成群居民在泼水施救，红十字会人员嘴巴上包着毛巾、鼻孔里塞上棉花，随着解放军战士从瓦砾堆旁抬走蒋军的尸体。由中山路至马道街、鼓楼街、书店街一带原是全市商业的中心区，宽阔的马路两侧排列着高大的西式建筑，人行道旁栽着青葱的树木。但如今却是疮痍满目。鼓楼和马道街一带横遭溃败的蒋军放火洗劫了，鼓楼顶被燃烧弹烧毁了，商务印书馆大楼被蒋机炸得只剩下了一付残骸。而原来全市最热闹的所在——宋代建筑相国寺，则被炸只剩了两个石狮子和半截泥菩萨。几天来蒋机的连续疯狂。轰炸和蒋匪被歼前的纵火抢劫，已造成了开封人民可怕的灾难。\n    解放军在战斗结束的当天，就撤到城外去了，市内由臂上戴着红布的纠察队在街口维持秩序。有些商店门外贴着解放军司令部政治部的告示：“主人不在，禁止入内。”外边并有纠察队员看管着这些无人的店铺，很多商人已背着包袱陆续从城外归来，看见这种情形，脸上都露出惊喜的神色。全城各大街头巷口，遍贴着解放军司令部政治部的安民布告和各项政策的布告，到处都围满了观众。傍晚，马路上喧闹起来，成群的穿着制服的男女学生、穿西装的教授和商人们都涌向维新中学和马道街南头的两处新华书店，购买解放区的书报，参观人民革命战争的照片展览。中山路上有些商店已开始营业，解放军战士挑着水在洒泼干燥多沙的马路，商店伙计也出来打扫街道，被解放军俘获的流线型轿车和美造的十轮大卡车不绝地驶过潮湿的马路，来往的人群川流不息。尽管敌人还在轰炸破坏，秩序却迅速恢复着。"

    "content": "Anguo County District Cadres Commemorate the Party's Birthday\n　　Establishing Various Systems and Disciplines\n    Resolutely Overcome the State of Undisciplined and Unorganized\n    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to commemorate \"July 1st,\" strengthen the ideological training of Party members, and improve work efficiency, the Anguo County Party Committee convened an enlarged meeting of 283 county and district cadres on June 22nd to investigate leadership, examine ideology, rectify the organization, rectify the system, and overcome the state of undisciplined and unorganized behavior. On the first day, the County Party Committee first stated its attitude, explaining that the County Party Committee had shortcomings in its leadership since the purge and replenishment movement and sincerely welcomed every comrade to boldly put forward their opinions during the commemoration of the Party's birthday in order to transform the leadership of the County Party Committee. It also called on every Party member to simultaneously examine themselves, improve themselves, and help others. At the meeting, \"Lenin on the Standards of Soviet Workers\" was studied. After two days of casual talks, discussions, and criticisms, everyone examined the following shortcomings in the leadership of the County Party Committee: 1. The analysis of problems was not careful enough, and the boundaries of policies were not clearly distinguished. In addition, the County Party Committee also had leftist sentiments, which contributed to the leftist sentiments of some comrades. For example, in the early stage of the purge and replenishment movement, in the Wazi Village of the Fourth District, landlord women were beaten. The County Party Committee introduced this wholesale in a circular, and other districts learned from it. Individual members of the County Party Committee spoke imprudently, which had a negative effect on some cadres. 2. Instructions on issues were not clear and specific enough, so that those below did not know what to do after reading the instructions. For example, when instructing on rectifying deviations, the class division standards in the 1933 document and Comrade Ren Bishi's report were not explained in terms of which amount of exploitation should be calculated, so those below were confused after reading it. 3. The leadership force was not unified enough. The County Party Committee was assigned to various districts, and the work steps were sometimes inconsistent. When expanding the army, some districts had already done a good job, while the First District was still engaged in land reform. 4. The understanding of the situation of cadres was not deep enough, and the problems of cadres were not solved in a timely manner. Problems that should have been solved were not solved. 5. Sometimes, a piece of work could not be carried out to the end. After individual villages received instructions to \"stop the struggle and distribute floating wealth,\" there were no further processing methods, and the doors are still sealed. In their self-examinations, the general district and county cadres also discovered some non-proletarian consciousness, the main ones being: (1) Some people have developed degenerate ideas. When encountering problems in their work, they felt depressed and unwilling to do hard work, wanting to go home. Some also felt that revolutionary work was not as comfortable as eating and working at home. (2) Some cadres had no regard for organization or discipline. ××× of the First District wanted to marry an improper woman and even wanted to admit her into the Party. ×× of the Third District was not active in his work, sleeping all day and going to market. When a district cadre was transferred, he said to the organization: \"Transfer me? I wanted to go home a long time ago.\" Many cadres firmly refused to be transferred to other districts. (3) Some cadres were burdened with ideological baggage, were not bold in their work, and were afraid of taking responsibility. Some felt that their class background was good, served as backbones during the ideological examination, and showed pride when they arrived in the village. On the third and fourth days of the meeting, a memorial ceremony was held to commemorate the martyrs who died. The County Party Committee announced its determination to thoroughly overcome the shortcomings raised by everyone in the leadership. According to the discussion results of each group, Zhang Genbo, Tian Xuekun, Wang Zhen, and other 25 comrades who resolutely obeyed transfers, worked hard and responsibly, actively studied, and helped others were rewarded on the spot. Du Zhongju and Jiao Tiqing, the district committee members of the Third District who had consistently disobeyed transfers and left their posts without authorization, were given the punishment of expulsion from the Party and a warning, respectively. Finally, the County Party Committee promoted a group of rewarded comrades and announced and passed the organizational discipline and work system: The County Party Committee will meet before the 25th of each month to check and arrange work. The district committees will meet once a month to mainly study the instructions of the higher authorities, check the degree of implementation, and solve various important problems. Each district will report its work to the County Party Committee before the 10th of each month. Rectify the organization branches to bring Party life back to normal, strengthen ideological leadership, solve problems when they arise, and report to the County Party Committee if they cannot be solved. In order to strengthen leadership, set up flag villages (key villages) in each district to cultivate backbones, assign district committee members to lead, and district secretaries to grasp the overall situation of the district, and solve problems through collective research. The district committees will regularly go to various sub-districts to check, grasp the ideology of cadres, criticize the bad ones and praise the good ones. Improve the two-hour study system. The meeting lasted for five days, and everyone's morale was high and their understanding gradually improved. Comrade Li Pu, the district secretary, said: \"I will resolutely obey the transfer. As soon as the higher-level makes a resolution, I guarantee not to bargain at all.\" The cadres of the Third District and the Chengguan District guaranteed that they would work with peace of mind at this meeting. Zhang Congxin of the First District guaranteed: \"I will overcome my degenerate ideas, guarantee never to commit them again, and ask everyone to supervise me. If I commit them again, I am willing to be sanctioned by Party discipline.\" Comrade Chen Guang, on behalf of the County Party Committee, swore to Chairman Mao and all the cadres: \"Humbly listen to everyone's opinions and improve the leadership style.\" After the meeting, Qi Huanzhang said: \"Such a meeting should have been held long ago. This time, many problems can be solved.\" (Wang Guang, Hong Guang, Wen Zheng)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安国县区干部纪念党的生日　确立各种制度纪律  坚决克服无纪律无组织状态\n王光　红光　文正\n1948-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安国县区干部纪念党的生日\n  　确立各种制度纪律\n    坚决克服无纪律无组织状态\n    【本报讯】为了纪念“七一”，加强党员的思想锻炼，提高工作效率，安国县委于六月二十二日召开全体县区干部二百八十三人的扩大会议，查领导，查思想，整组织，整制度，克服无纪律无组织的状态。第一天县委首先表明了态度，说明自抽补运动以来，县委在领导上曾有缺点，诚恳欢迎每个同志在纪念党的生日时，大胆的把自己的意见提出来，以便改造县委的领导。并号召每个党员同时检讨自己，提高自己，帮助别人，会议上学习了“列宁论苏维埃工作人员的标准”。经过两天的漫谈、讨论、批评，大家检讨出县委领导上存有如下缺点：一、研究分析问题不仔细，对政策界限没有分清，加之县委亦有左的情绪，以致助长了一些同志的左倾情绪。如抽补运动初期，四区洼子里吊打地主女人，县委在通报上原盘的介绍出去，别的区就有的学了起来。有个别县委说话不慎重，对某些干部起了不好的作用。二、指示问题时不够明确具体，使下面看了指示不知怎么办是好。如指示纠偏时，对一九三三年文件和任弼时同志报告中划阶级标准，也没说明到底按那个剥削分量计算，所以下面看了很糊涂。三、领导力量不够统一，县委都分到各区，工作步骤有时不一致，扩军时有的区已经干得不错了，一区还在搞土改。四、深刻了解干部情况、及时解决干部问题做得很差，该解决的问题没有解决。五、进行一件工作，有时不能贯彻下来。个别村庄接到“停止斗争分浮财”的指示后，没有进一步处理的办法，现在还封着门。一般区县干部在自我检讨中，也发现了若干非无产阶级意识，其中主要的是：（一）有些人产生了蜕化思想，作工作碰到钉子，情绪低落了，不愿作艰苦的工作，想回家。也有些人觉着革命工作不如自己在家吃点干点痛快。（二）有些干部目无组织目无纪律。一区×××想和一个不正派的妇女结婚，竟想把她吸收入党。三区××不积极工作，成天睡大觉、赶集。一个区干在调动时对组织上说：“还调我？我早就想回家”。不少干部向外区调动时坚决不去。（三）一些干部思想上背着包袱，工作不大胆，怕负责。有的觉着自己成份好，查思想时当过骨干，到村里表现骄傲。会议的第三、四天，举行纪念仪式，追悼死难烈士，县委宣布决心彻底克服大家对领导上所提缺点。并根据各小组讨论结果，当场奖励了坚决服从调动，工作艰苦负责，积极学习，帮助别人的张根波、田学坤、王珍等二十五个同志，对于一贯不服从调动，私自脱离工作岗位的三区区委杜中聚、焦提清分别给予开除党籍和警告的处分。最后县委提拔了一批受奖的同志，并宣布与通过了组织纪律与工作制度：县委每月二十五日前开会，检查与布置工作，每月月底各区区委会议一次，主要研究上级指示，检查执行程度，解决各种重要问题，各区十号前向县委报告工作。整顿机关支部，使党的生活步入正规，加强思想领导，有了问题就解决，解决不了的报告县委。为加强领导，在各区设旗帜村（重点村）培养骨干，区委分工领导，区书掌握全区，有问题大家研究解决。区委经常到各小区检查，掌握干部思想，批评坏的表扬好的。健全二小时学习制。会议前后经过五天的时间，大家情绪饱满，认识逐步提高。区书李普同志说：“我要坚决服从调动，上级一决议，保证一丝一点不讲价钱。”三区和城关区干部保证在此次会议，一定安心工作。一区张从心保证：“克服自己的蜕化思想，保证永不再犯，并要求大家监督，再犯了愿受党纪制裁。”陈光同志代表县委向毛主席向全体干部宣誓：“虚心听取大家意见，改进领导作风。”会议结束后，齐焕章说：“象这样的会，早就应当开，这一下可解决问题不少。”（王光、红光、文正）"

    "content": "When the Chiang bandits occupied the empty city of Pinggu, everyone except a very few “big bellies” ran away. Zhang Zizhen, the owner of the Yongyu general merchandise store in Xiguan South Street, thought to himself, \"We are all Chinese, whoever comes will collect taxes and levies.\" He did not run.\n\nAfter a burst of rapid footsteps, the sound of banging and smashing doors echoed throughout the streets and alleys, mixed with shouts and curses.\n\nThe door of Yongyu Store was opened, and a group of bandit soldiers poured in, angrily shouting, \"This is a shop of the Eighth Route Army!\" The owner quickly explained, \"Gentlemen, this is a private business.\" \"What? There is no private store in Pinggu city.\" The owner pleaded, \"It is indeed my private business, I dare not lie to the 'National Army'.\" A bandit soldier pulled the bolt of his rifle, chambered a round, and pointed it at his heart, cursing, \"You still quibble, want to eat a bullet!\" The owner was so frightened that he had to retreat silently to the side. So, the Chiang bandit soldiers grabbed the noodles, dried vermicelli, and peanut oil from his shelves. More and more bandit soldiers came, and Yongyu Store had less and less goods, but what made the owner most sad was the jar of more than two hundred *jin* of soy sauce, the two jars of more than five hundred *jin* of vinegar, and half a jar of wine. The wine was drunk up by the bandit soldiers, and the two jars of vinegar mash were poured all over the house and courtyard.\n\nThen, the Chiang bandit soldiers wanted to repair the city walls, build bunkers, and dig moats, and they demolished his house and many other people's houses. This made Zhang Zizhen anxious, but he had not fully understood the Chiang bandit soldiers, and thought, \"If the soldiers are so bad, the officers can't ignore it, every army should have some law.\" He went into the city to file a complaint. He went to the political department of the bandit army, but no one paid attention to him. Later, he went to the military law office, and a fat adjutant came out to accept his complaint. Zhang, the shopkeeper, complained bitterly to him, \"Everything has been taken away, now I can only go begging with a casserole.\" Who knew that the fat adjutant impatiently replied cunningly, \"In times of war, 'misunderstandings' are inevitable. Judging from what you said, the losses are not small, how about compensating you with five hundred *jin* of millet?\" The owner, looking at his fierce appearance, was so frightened that he kept saying, \"No compensation is needed, no compensation is needed.\" The fat adjutant stared and asked, \"Is it because you think it's too little?\" The owner said, \"It's not that I think it's too little, I dare not accept it.\" \"'National Army' is reasonable, that's it, here's five hundred *jin* of millet for you, go back.\" With that, he left. But where was the millet? Where to get it? The owner woke up and realized that what he said was just empty words. Openly robbing the common people, this is the \"law\" of the Chiang bandit army. He went home, full of resentment.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army has returned. The day after the Chiang bandit soldiers abandoned the city and fled, Zhang, the shopkeeper, looked blankly at the empty shelves, the overturned vinegar jars, and some piles of rubble that had been demolished, recalling the scene of the increasingly prosperous business since the People's Liberation Army liberated Pinggu from the hands of the Chiang bandits last year—for example, in the past, if he sold five jars of vinegar, then he could sell ten jars. This gradually rising life was suddenly ruined by the Chiang bandit soldiers. Thinking of this, Zhang, the shopkeeper, suddenly realized that the People's Liberation Army is truly the army of the people, and the Chiang bandits are the army that betray the country and harm the people.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Reports from various sources: The general strike in Turin has just ended, and a wave of strikes has swept through Italy. After the Confederation of Industries refused to consider re-establishing wages, the General Confederation of Labor ordered a half-day general strike of workers nationwide on July 2nd. The communique stated that current prices are high, and ordinary living standards can no longer be maintained. Therefore, it was decided to take action to demand negotiations with the factory owners. July 2nd is the day before the Italian traitorous government is scheduled to sign a bilateral agreement with the United States regarding the \"Marshall Plan.\" Once this agreement is signed, the living standards of the Italian people will further deteriorate.\n\tPrior to this, Milan workers held a half-day general strike on June 24th, the direct purpose of which was to support the workers of the local Motta canned sweets company who had been on strike for more than twenty days, and also to protest the industrial decline caused by the Italian government's implementation of traitorous anti-labor policies, resulting in continuous layoffs across the country. The Milan Party Department of the Communist Party issued a communique calling on workers to \"oppose the government policies responsible for the situation, a situation that is the result of the activities of reactionary capital groups that want to make the Italian economy subservient to the Marshall Plan\" (Associated Press). For the same reasons, workers in the provinces of Pisa and Brescia also held a one-day general strike on the 24th. 120,000 food workers across the country also began a strike on June 26th in response to the General Confederation of Labor's strike call \"against the dismissal of workers for economic reasons.\" Ten thousand workers in the metal and shipbuilding industries in Venice held a strike on the 18th to protest the factory's dismissal of workers. Four thousand agricultural workers in the province of Piacenza (southeast of Milan) went on strike on June 23rd after contract negotiations broke down. On the same day, thousands of unemployed veterans demonstrated in Naples.\n\tXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Reports from various sources: The strike by nearly 20,000 London dockworkers had reached two weeks by June 27th. This strike has now gained the sympathy of dockworkers elsewhere. Dockworkers in Liverpool, Britain's second largest port, held a mass meeting on the 27th and resolved to hold a sympathy strike for the London strikers. On the 29th, the Associated Press reported that at least 9,000 dockworkers in Liverpool had gone on strike, and 2,000 dockworkers in Birkenhead, across the Mersey from Liverpool, had gone on strike. Although the government and reactionary leaders in the trade unions jointly issued a \"return to work\" call on the 23rd, and the government sent 300 soldiers to work unloading cargo, with some scabs personally standing at the entrances to the docks to supervise the resumption of work, and Attlee issued a threat that \"if the strike continues, the government will send more troops to the docks,\" all of this had no effect. On the 25th, Deakin, General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, attempted to make the workers agree to return to work on the 28th with the government's deployment of more soldiers to unload cargo as a \"final warning,\" but his \"warning\" was drowned out by loud jeers from the angry workers, who shouted: \"Let them send troops,\" \"We will continue to strike\" (Associated Press). At a strikers' rally held on the 26th, the strike committee (which, according to Agence France-Presse, included five Communists, ten Labour Party members, and twenty-seven non-partisans) received an overwhelming vote of confidence, with only twenty out of two thousand dockworkers supporting a return to work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意罢工运动风起云涌英码头工人坚持斗争\n\n1948-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　意罢工运动风起云涌英码头工人坚持斗争\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】各方报导：都灵总罢工刚刚结束，意大利的罢工运动又已风起云涌。在厂主联合会拒绝考虑重新制订工资之后，总工会已下令全国工人于七月二日举行半天总罢工。公报说，现在物价高涨，普通生活水平已不能维持，因此，决定用行动来要求和厂主进行谈判。七月二日是意大利卖国政府预定和美国签订关于“马歇尔计划”之双边协定的前一日，此一协定一旦签订，意国人民的生活水平将更形恶化。\n    在此之前，米兰工人于六月二十四日举行半天总罢工，其直接目的为声援罢工已达二十余天的当地摩塔罐头糖果公司的工人，同时也是抗议意政府因执行卖国的反劳工政策的结果而造成的工业衰落，以致各地解雇工人的事件不断发生。共产党米兰党部为此曾发出公报，号召工人“反对应对局势负责的政府政策，这个局势是那些想使意大利经济奴属于马歇尔计划的反动资本集团活动的结果”（合众社）。由于同样的原因，彼萨与布里西亚省的工人亦于廿四日总罢工一天。全国十二万食品工人亦于六月二十六日开始罢工，以响应总工会“反对以经济理由解雇工人”的罢工号召。威尼斯金属与造船两业的工人一万人，为抗议厂方开除工人曾于十八日举行罢工。配森萨省（在米兰东南）的四万农业工人，在新合同谈判决裂以后，已于六月二十三日实行罢工。同一天，那不勒斯有数千失业退伍军人示威。\n    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：将近两万人的伦敦码头工人的罢工，至六月二十七日止，坚持斗争已达两周。这一罢工现已得到其他地方码头工人的同情。英国第二大港利物浦的码头工人于二十七日召开群众大会，决议对伦敦的罢工者举行同情罢工。二十九日，合众社称，利物浦至少已有九千码头工人罢工，利物浦对岸之柏肯黑德有两千码头工人罢工。虽然政府和工会中的反动领袖于二十三日联合发出“复工”号召，政府且派出三百名士兵去作起卸货物的工作，若干工贼并亲自站在码头的入口处要监督复工，以及艾德礼发出“若罢工继续不止，则政府将抽派更多军队至各船坞”的威胁等等，但是，所有这些都没有发生效果。二十五日，运输及各业工人工会总书记狄金，在南瓦克公园举行的群众大会上，以政府增派士兵卸货为“最后警告”，企图使工人答应于二十八日复工，然而，他的“警告”却为愤怒的工人大声嘲骂所吓倒，罢工工人高呼：“让他们派军队好了”，“我们要继续罢工。”（合众社）在二十六日举行的一次罢工工人的集会上，罢工委员会（据法新社称，其中包括五名共产党员，十名工党党员，二十七名无党无派者）获得压倒多数的信任，两千船坞工人中，只有二十人赞成复工。"

After the battalion's \"three check-ups,\" \"speaking bitterness,\" and \"comparison and evaluation\" movements, morale has been further boosted. During the Chahar-Suiyuan Campaign, they repeatedly requested to be the main attacking force and to fight major victories. However, each time the main attack task was assigned to other units. On the evening of the 3rd, the battalion, along with friendly forces, marched sixty li in eight hours, capturing the outer strongholds of Gaolipu and Yanjiapu, and plunged into the enemy's defensive center, Fengrun City, immediately occupying the four passes and dividing the enemy's entire county defense system. After 12:00 noon on the 14th, under the unified command of higher authorities, the battalion carried out ten hours of extremely precise preparations for attacking the city. A crossfire of artillery and machine guns was formed in the 100-meter-wide area of the planned assault point, and every loophole in the city was tightly sealed by our forces. There was a clear division of labor for each target to be sealed off. The assault teams all studied the terrain. At 1:00 p.m., the general offensive was launched, and the defense of Fengrun City, held by more than 2,000 enemies, immediately became ineffective. One company of the battalion first captured the city in eight minutes. Then, a certain battalion captured the entire city in seven minutes.

The underlying cause of the impending government crisis is the dissatisfaction of the American reactionary groups with the Ashida government's inability to suppress the democratic movement, which has become a major obstacle to their (referring to the American reactionary groups) long-term plans. The recent intensification of the American occupation authorities' interference in Japan's domestic political struggles, as well as the arrest of the most active members of the democratic movement, are not accidental. The American authorities are encouraging the formation of a united front of Japanese reactionaries, and the so-called \"Liberal Democratic Party\" (Note: The \"Liberal Democratic Party\" was formed on March 15th of this year through the merger of Kijuro Shidehara's Democratic Party and Shigeru Yoshida's Liberal Party, a so-called \"new conservative party.\" Shigeru Yoshida is currently the party leader, with Kijuro Shidehara as honorary advisor), is becoming the gathering center for Japanese reactionaries in the post-war period. The current political situation in Japan shows that the American occupation authorities are preparing to launch another attack on the democratic movement together with Japanese reactionaries. However, the democratic movement has taken such firm root in Japan since the defeat of Japanese militarism that neither Japanese reactionaries nor American reactionaries can reverse the wheels of Japanese history. Moreover, this would contradict the vital interests of all countries striving for peace and security in the Pacific region, making it even more impossible.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日本七万学生大罢课　苏消息报评论  日本民主运动已坚固的生了根美日反动派不能倒转历史车轮\n\n1948-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日本七万学生大罢课\n    苏消息报评论\n    日本民主运动已坚固的生了根美日反动派不能倒转历史车轮\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】东京消息：二十四所日本大学及高等学校约七万五千名学生，于二十三日发动大罢课。二十四日，罢课浪潮已“遍及全日各地”，至二十六日，参加罢课的学校为数已达一百一十所。罢课学生抗议政府所提出的新预算案中关于增加学费的建议：该议案现正为日议会讨论中。罢课学生现已设立许多联络处，以解释罢课之原因及商议向议会提交请愿书之方法。在东京大车站及街道上，学生成群地征求支持者签名。\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】据塔斯社二十五日讯：消息报分析家于评论日本政局时指出：日本政局情况现已如此紧张，以致日本报纸正在预言芦田内阁行将垮台。迫在眉睫的政府危机的基本原因，便是美国反动集团不满芦田政府无能镇压那成为他们（指美国反动集团）长远计谋之主要障碍的民主运动。美国占领当局最近对日本国内政治斗争之加强干涉，以及逮捕民主运动的最积极分子，都不是偶然的。美国当局正鼓励成立日本反动派的联合阵线，而所谓“自由民主党”（按“自由民主党”系于本年三月十五日成立，由币原喜重郎派的民主党和吉田茂的自由党合并而组成的所谓“新保守党”。该党党魁现为吉田茂，币原当名誉顾问），则正化为战后时期日本反动派的汇集中心，日本目前的政治情况，显示美国占领当局正与日本反动派共同准备对民主运动发起另一进攻。但民主运动在日本军国主义败北之后，业已那样巩固的生了根，以致无论日本反动派或美国反动派，均不可能倒转日本的历史车轮，加之，这是与力求太平洋地区和平与安全的一切国家的切身利益相抵触的，所以就更不可能了。"

In the puppet Manchukuo era, a carding machine took seven days to install, but now the same manpower only needs two days. Due to the increase in machines and the expansion of business, the factory added 1,000 new workers in May. In order to help the newly arrived workers settle down, the factory lent out 63,000 jin of grain and 3.2 million yuan. The General Labor Union also cooperated with the factory to organize cooperatives to supply workers with daily necessities at low prices and to organize production for workers' families. Workers in a certain machine factory have launched competition campaigns between work groups and individuals. Worker Nie Zhencai modified the mandrel of the spinning machine, increasing output by 30 percent. When the Liaonan Administrative Office shoe factory was first established in January of this year, each person made an average of two pairs of shoes per day.

As for the scheduled national general strike of workers in all industries, the congress decided not to hold it because the steelworkers could obtain satisfactory understanding.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法比两国工人罢工获得胜利\n\n1948-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法比两国工人罢工获得胜利\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】据合众社二十二日电称：在总罢工一星期之后，法国中部城市克勒蒙腓隆总工会的会员，已与厂方获得协议。又据塔斯社消息：法国南部马赛港之金属工人一千一百人，在他们的增资要求被拒绝以后，已于二十一日宣布罢工并占领工厂。\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】合众社布鲁塞尔讯：比利时钢铁工人工会于二十一日午后宣布：“六天的总罢工已获解决”，工会已下令罢工工人复工，解决之临时办法为工人将获得“计勤奖金”，此项奖金约等于工人原有工资的百分之三，罢工工人原来的要求是增资百分之五，比利时总工会于二十日曾召开非常代表大会。大会以六十六万九千票对十二万票通过决议，要求各工业部门最低工资应增至每小时相当于美金三角三分之水平，并要求政府取消用以强迫工人复工的“非军事动员法”。至于预定之全国各业工人总罢工，因钢铁工人可获得满意之谅解，代表大会决议不再举行。"

Citizens who were left homeless by the Chiang bandits' demolition or burning of houses were all overjoyed. The Fourth District of Luoyang City had 2,311 houses demolished and burned by the Youth Army 206th Division. Now, the citizens of the district have demolished 37 pillboxes, leveled 83 fortifications, flattened 7 moats, and built 175 new houses. The Southeast and Northwest Cross Streets, which were originally a pile of rubble, have gradually become a bustling market again. (2) Most of the handicraft industries in Luoyang City have resumed operations. The Zhicheng and Yuxing foundries are manufacturing iron pots and pot skins, and each family can cast 1,000 jin of pig iron per day. Business is extremely good, and the pots are bought before they even cool down. During the period when the Chiang bandits occupied the area last year, Zhicheng Factory lost more than 30,000 jin of iron and more than 10,000 jin of charcoal due to donations, labor, and pots. In November, the Chiang bandit Youth Army simply demolished the factory building, and the factory was forced to close down. In addition, after the opening of 33 soap factories such as Dahua and Xiangtai, the soap is now selling well in Ru, Song, Yu, and Shan counties. (3) The Chiang currency in Luoyang City has plummeted wildly. Its ratio to Jicha has fallen from 50 to 1 to 70 to 1, and then to 100 to 1. The reason is that the Chiang bandit army has suffered repeated defeats on various battlefields. In addition, a large number of goods are being transported from the old liberated areas north of the Yellow River. Merchants are vying for Jicha and throwing out Chiang currency.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 洛阳建设简讯\n\n1948-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　洛阳建设简讯\n    【新华社中原三十日电】（一）洛阳市府号召市民拆除蒋匪所修筑的一切碉堡工事，利用砖木修盖新房。被蒋匪拆毁或烧毁房屋无家可归的市民无不兴高采烈。洛市第四区曾被青年军二○六师拆毁及烧毁民房二千三百一十一间；现该区市民已拆毁碉堡三十七个，扫平工事八十三个，平壕沟七条，修成新房一百七十五间。原为一片瓦砾的东南两关十字街，已又渐成闹市。（二）洛市各手工业大部复业，翻沙厂志诚、裕兴等，制造铁锅、锅皮，每天每家能翻生铁一千斤。生意极好，刚铸下来还没有冷就被买去。志诚厂在去年蒋匪盘踞期间因出捐、出夫、出锅，仅原料一项即赔了三万多斤铁，一万多斤炭。十一月间蒋匪青年军干脆把该厂厂房拆掉，该厂乃被迫倒闭。又大华、祥泰等三十三家肥皂厂开业后，现肥皂畅销汝、嵩县、禹县及陕县等地。（三）洛市蒋币狂跌，其与冀钞之比，由五十比一跌至七十比一，再跌至一百比一。原来是蒋匪军在各战场上连吃败仗。另外则大批货物从黄河北岸老解放区源源运来，商人均争要冀钞，抛出蒋币。"

    "content": "[North Yue News] In accordance with the special district's instructions to strengthen grain storage, the Fifth District of Hunyuan strictly inspected the work of the grain depots. Materials from eighteen villages show that the grain depots were quite chaotic. Many county, district, and village cadres illegally borrowed public grain for weddings and funerals, and the custodians also ate and used it casually. The village chief of Wu Village used 2,200 jin of public grain to marry his wife, and out of the eighty households in Shakeng who were responsible for safekeeping, seventy-one households consumed public grain. These eighteen villages illegally used 46,236 jin of millet, 28,822 jin of miscellaneous grains, 10,200 jin of grain straw, and 129,290 jin of yams from the public grain. The main reasons for this phenomenon are that the leadership did not pay enough attention to grain work, the financial and grain departments relaxed their leadership for a long time, did not conduct in-depth inspections, lacked systems, and failed to solve problems in a timely manner, which led to increasingly serious problems. The district has now stipulated the principle of \"return what was used, return what is available\" to recover the borrowed public grain. For villages with particularly serious problems, mass meetings are held to announce the facts of the errors, solicit opinions from the masses, and then send them to the district and county for handling according to law. After the rectification, the villages have returned 13,000 jin, and the rest will be returned within a set time limit.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 浑源五区整顿粮库\n\n1948-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　浑源五区整顿粮库\n    【北岳讯】浑源五区根据专区加强粮食保管的指示，严格检查粮库工作。有十八个村的材料说明：粮库相当混乱。不少县、区、村干部遇有婚丧喜事，非法借用公粮，保管户也有随便吃用现象。吴村村长娶老婆动用公粮二二○○斤，沙圪坑八十户代替保管的，有七十一户吃公粮。这十八个村非法动用公粮小米四六二三六斤，杂粮二八八二二斤，谷草一○二○○斤，山药一二九二九○斤。造成这种现象的原因，主要是由于领导上对粮食工作注意不够，财粮部门长期放松领导，不深入检查，没有制度，发现问题不能及时解决，以致问题越拖越严重。现该区已规定“用啥还啥，有啥还啥”的原则，收回借用的公粮。对问题特别严重的村庄，则召开群众大会，宣布错误事实，征求群众意见，然后送区县依法处理。经过整顿后，各村已补还一三○○○斤，其余一律限期还清。"

    "content": "“Believing in Government Policies Leads to Wealth”\n    Businessman Li Dexin Praises Industrial and Commercial Policies\n\n    [Taihang News] After receiving the wrongfully confiscated pigments and cash back from the government, Wu'an businessman Li Dexin was very moved. He said, \"The government corrects its mistakes when it finds them, truly practicing what it preaches. Now that I have everything back, how can I not work hard?\" After more than a month of diligent operation, a brand-new general store is gradually expanding. He adopted a policy of small profits and quick turnover; while others aim for a 5% profit, he only takes 2%, and his business is very good. He constantly promotes this to other merchants and explains the situation to those who are still afraid to return. In Handan, he met Kong Suixi, the shopkeeper who had been involved in the handicraft industry troubles, and told him about his own recovery. These people are returning one after another. The government is returning all the entrusted materials to them, and everyone is actively running their businesses. Li Dexin said, \"Commerce will develop greatly in the future, as transportation is convenient now, and travel is much easier.\" He also said with full confidence: \"Today, as long as you believe in the government's policies, you can get rich.\"\n\n    [Taihang News] Businessman Cheng Shiquan wrote a letter to the newspaper, saying that he \"untied a big knot that had been tied for five years.\" The original letter is as follows: I am Cheng Shiquan from Qiaoshang Village, First District, Huguan. My family was very poor since I was a child. My father was a coppersmith, and I went out to learn coppersmithing from my father for six years when I was thirteen. At the age of twenty, I learned masonry for another two years. At the age of twenty-three, I started doing business. Now I am forty years old, and I am still doing business outside. There are four people in my family, and we cultivate thirteen and a half mu of land. Because I didn't understand the Communist Party's policies in the past, I didn't dare to go home when I was doing business outside, fearing that the masses would struggle against me. In the past, I thought that doing business was exploitation, and I often regretted that I shouldn't have become a businessman. Thinking about it, I always felt that businessmen had no future. This knot has been tied since the movement in 1942 and has been tied for five years. After Comrade Cheng Laigui from my village repeatedly wrote letters to explain, I was always half-believing and half-doubting, and I didn't dare to boldly go home. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, I returned to the village and initially approached the masses. The cadres and masses in my village were very good to me. Not only did they not struggle against me, but they also allocated a plot of land to me. At this time, I untied the knot that had been tied for five years. After seeing the Central Bureau's instructions on correcting leftist tendencies, various places have compensated the wrongly struggled middle peasants and returned the struggled industrial and commercial enterprises. At the same time, the policy stipulates developing industry and commerce and protecting industry and commerce. I then realized that our current revolution is about confiscating bureaucratic capital. After understanding this policy, the knot in my mind was completely untied. I hope that fellow businessmen from all over the country will refer to and study this letter I wrote.

    "content": "[North Yue News] The emancipated peasants and Communist Party members of the North Yue District enthusiastically signed up to join the army. As of the end of April, the number of new soldiers who enlisted has reached more than 16,000. The biggest feature of this conscription movement is the adoption of a self-reporting and public discussion approach, following the mass line for mobilization, which has achieved good results. There have been few instances of coercion or disguised hiring. The quality of the new soldiers is higher than in previous campaigns. Among the 3,064 new soldiers from Wutai, Mengxian, and Yixian counties, 1,073 were Party members, accounting for approximately 32% of the total. When the Xiji Village branch in the first district of Mengxian County held a meeting to discuss joining the army, branch secretary Yang Xiucheng and female Party member Zhao Huani volunteered to sign up their son. On the day of the mass meeting, Yang Xiaolv (Xiucheng's son), Zhang Chenghuai, Zhang Mingquan, and other nine young adults signed up, guaranteeing to the villagers that they would \"eliminate the Chiang-Yan army and thoroughly liberate all of China\" and requesting to join the Communist Party. After review by the higher-level Party committee, those who were qualified have been approved. Han Yinshuang, a comrade and Party member from Shangshe in the fifth district of Mengxian County, said when he signed up: \"The Party led us to liberation, and this Party rectification has further raised our political consciousness. I want to be the first to respond to the Party's call and help the unliberated people to achieve emancipation.\" When Liu Fengxi, a peasant from Xiabei Tou in Yixian County, sent his son Liu Changyou to join the army, he repeatedly told him: \"We come from the old common people, so when you are outside, you must treat the elderly as you would treat your own parents. Every family has men, women, old and young. Don't make mistakes, and learn from the veteran cadres and veteran comrades. This way, you will be worthy of Chairman Mao, and your family will be at ease.\"\n\n[Report from this newspaper] \"Expand the People's Liberation Army, fight to Nanjing, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!\" The emancipated peasants of Pingding County launched an enthusiastic conscription movement under such magnificent slogans. In three or four days, more than 500 people poured into the People's Liberation Army. Communist Party members and cadres took the lead everywhere, setting an example. At the cadre mobilization meeting, more than 70 Party members and cadres from ten districts signed up to join the army. On the 13th of this month, more than 3,000 men, women, old and young people gathered in the city to give a festive send-off to the heroes who were formally enlisting. Rong Defa, the representative of the new soldiers, addressed the gathering: \"The Communist Party has come, and I have risen from a poor man to a new middle peasant. I know clearly who is the savior of the people and who is the enemy of the people. This time I join the army to fight to Nanjing, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate all the oppressed people in China.\"\n\n[Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Hebei, 30th] A mass conscription upsurge has swept through areas south of the Beining Railway in Eastern Hebei in the middle of this month. In Leting and Luannan (newly established county, south of Luanxian) counties alone, more than 3,500 people signed up for the army in just over ten days. In Jiatan Village in Leting, 138 people signed up at the same time, and 21 militiamen from Dadian Village collectively enlisted. × Jiang, from Jiangjiaying, said at the send-off meeting for the new soldiers: \"My brother was killed by the 'Huo Hui' reactionary landlord. This time, I'm sending my son and second younger brother to join the army to avenge my elder brother.\" At the conscription meeting in the eighth district of Leting, 900 new soldiers took an oath to bravely and tenaciously annihilate the enemy and fight to liberate the starving and persecuted compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 自报公议走群众路线　北岳万六千人光荣入伍　冀东三千五百余人参军\n\n1948-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　自报公议走群众路线\n    北岳万六千人光荣入伍\n    冀东三千五百余人参军\n    【北岳讯】北岳区翻身农民和共产党员踊跃报名参军，截至四月底止，入伍的新战士已达一万六千余名。这次参军运动最大的特点是采用了自报公议群众路线的动员方式，获得了良好的效果。很少发生强迫和变相雇佣的现象。新战士的质量比以往历次都高。五台、孟县、易县三县三千零六十四名新战士中，党员占一千零七十三名，约占总数百分之三十二。孟县一区西吉村支部开会讨论参军时，支书杨秀成和女党员赵花妮自动替儿子报名，开群众大会的那天，杨小驴（秀成的儿子）、张成槐、张明全等九个青壮年报名后，向乡亲们保证“消灭蒋阎军，彻底解放全中国”，并要求加入共产党，经上级党委审查，合格者都已批准。孟县五区上社党员韩银双同志报名时说：“党领导咱们翻了身，这次整党更提高了我们的政治觉悟，我要首先响应党的号召，帮助没有解放的老百性翻身。”易县下北头农民刘凤喜送儿子刘长有入伍时，再三嘱咐说：“咱是老百性出身，出了外面，对待老人们要和对待自己的老人一样，谁的家里没个男女老少？可不要犯错误，要向老干部、老同事们学好，这样就对得住毛主席了，咱家里的人也就放心了。”\n    【本报讯】“扩大人民解放军，打到南京去，活捉蒋介石！”平定翻身农民在这种雄伟的口号声中，展开了热烈的参军运动。三、四天内即有五百余人涌入人民解放军。共产党员和干部到处打先锋，起带头作用。在干部动员会上，十个区有七十多名党员干部先后报名入伍。本月十三日城关三千余男女老少集会欢送英雄们正式入伍，新战士代表戎德法向大家讲话：“共产党来了，我由穷人升成新中农，我清楚谁是人民的救星，谁是人民的敌人，我这次参军，就要打到南京去活捉蒋介石，解放全中国被压迫人民。”\n    【新华社冀东三十日电】冀东北宁路南各地本月中旬掀起群众性参军热潮。乐亭、滦南（新设县，在滦县以南）两县十数天中报名参军者即达三千五百余人。乐亭贾滩村有一百三十八人同时报名，大店村有二十一名民兵集体入伍，蒋家营的×蒋氏在欢送新战士大会上说：“我兄弟被‘伙会’反动地主杀害了，这回叫我儿子和二弟去参军，替大兄弟报仇。”在乐亭八区的参军大会上，九百名新战士举行了宣誓，要英勇顽强的歼灭敌人，为解放蒋管区受饥饿、被迫害的同胞而战。"

The market has begun to prosper, and many businesses are actively developing their operations. Some stores that were previously empty are now stocked with new goods. Many stores are recruiting new staff, painting their storefronts, and renovating their buildings. Merchants who had fled are also returning one after another, actively planning to resume their businesses. After the liberation of Wu'an County, there were a total of 1,272 industrial and commercial businesses and vendors in the town (including 267 seated merchants, 823 vendors, 97 workshops, 84 handicraft businesses, 6 factories, and 92 others). Through the joint urban-rural struggle from the winter of 1945 to the spring of 1946, over 130 larger industrial and commercial businesses were excessively struggled against (valued at a total of 130 million Jiao banknotes at the then market price). More than 3,000 townspeople faced difficulties in making a living due to the market downturn. Industrial and commercial businesses that had not been infringed upon also harbored fears of being \"cut down like韭菜 (chives, a metaphor for repeated exploitation),\" adopting an attitude of maintaining the status quo and not developing further. In order to implement the Party's policy on industry and commerce, the Wu'an County government, under the personal leadership of County Chief Zhang, began to return and compensate infringed industrial and commercial businesses in mid-April. Over two months, 85 businesses have been returned (50 seated merchants, 28 workshops and small vendors, and 1 factory), amounting to 117.87 million Jiao banknotes. The remaining 50 businesses are also settling accounts and handling return procedures. In terms of return methods, businesses where \"the god is changed but not the temple\" (i.e., the store or factory still exists, but the shareholders have changed) are returned the original amount; for those that were divided among the masses, low-interest loans from the bank and compensation from the fruits of the poor people's association are used to enable them to continue operating. The actual return compensation, combined with the publicity of the Party's policy on industry and commerce, gradually dispelled the doubts and misconceptions about our policies that citizens and store owners had developed due to past leftist errors. All 85 industrial and commercial businesses that have been returned have restored their original names, refreshed their storefronts, purchased new goods, and opened one after another. Merchants who had fled to various places have also returned one after another, actively resuming their businesses. In the last two months alone, 11 households have returned to Sanjie Street. Bai Yinzhou, the manager of the Huafengtai Pharmacy, returned immediately from Tianjin upon hearing that Wu'an was returning industry and commerce. The market has become active, business has expanded, and all stores are adding staff. According to a survey of 30 seated merchants such as Yuanhexin and Tongmao, 44 new employees have been added. Under the influence of the return of industry and commerce, industrial and commercial families that were not struggled against are actively developing upwards, purchasing new goods one after another. For example, Li Qinglan of Fuqingheng Felt Workshop closed his business and returned to his hometown of Xiyang last year for fear of struggle, but recently returned to open his business again. Wanshunheng Grain Store did not dare to develop in the past, but this year has taken out several loans from the bank, each time over 1 million. Merchants said: \"The conditions for doing business are now very convenient. First, no road passes are required; second, if funds are lacking, we can get loans from the government. As long as the business is done right, it is easy to make money.\" The county government recently held a symposium with industrial and commercial capitalists to help them study how to develop industry and commerce and prosper the market in the future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 退还错斗工商业后　武安市场走向繁荣\n\n1948-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　退还错斗工商业后\n    武安市场走向繁荣\n    【太行讯】武安坚决执行党的保护工商业政策，纠正过去左倾错误，退还与补偿了错斗工商业，市场开始走上繁荣，许多商号在积极发展营业。有些商店过去货架是空的，这时出现了新的货物，不少商店在招收新的人员，刷漆门面，修整市房。逃亡在外的商人也纷纷归来，积极筹划复业。该县城关解放后，共有一千二百七十二家工商业和摊贩（内坐商二百六十七家，摊贩八百二十三家，作坊九十七家，手工业八十四家，工厂六家，其他九十二家）。经过一九四五年冬至一九四六年春的城乡联合斗争，先后过左的斗争了较大工商业一百卅多家（按当时的市价折合，共值冀钞（下同）一万万三千万元）。全城有三千多市民因市场萧条，谋生感到困难。未被侵犯的工商业也都存在怕“割韭菜”思想，抱着只维持现状不发展的态度。武安县府为执行党的工商业政策，在张县长亲自参加领导下，于四月中开始退还补偿被侵犯的工商业，经过两个月时间，已经退还了八十五家（坐商五十家，作坊小商贩二十八家，工厂一家），折合一万万一千七百八十七万。下余的五十家也清算帐目，办理退还手续。在退还办法上，换神不换庙者（即商店或工厂还在，股东易人）原数退还；群众分了的，由银行低利贷款和从贫民会的果实中补偿，使能继续营业。实际的退还补偿和宣传党的工商业政策相结合，使市民及商店主由过去过左的错误做法所产生对我政策的怀疑与错觉，逐渐消除。已退还的八十五家工商业，均已恢复原来字号，刷新门面，添购货物，先后开张。逃亡各地的商人也纷纷归来，积极复业，光三街在最近两月中就回来十一户。华丰泰药行掌柜白银周，听说武安退还工商业，立即从天津返来。市场活跃了，营业扩大了，各商店均在添增人员。据元和新、同茂号等三十家坐商调查，新添人员达四十四名。未被斗争的工商业家在退还工商业的影响下，积极向上发展，纷纷采办新货。如复庆恒毡坊李庆兰，去年怕斗争，关门回了原籍昔阳，最近又回来开门营业；万顺恒粮店过去不敢发展，今年从银行贷款数次，每次一百余万。商人们说：“现在做买卖条件很便利，第一不开路条，第二资金缺少能从政府贷款，只要买卖作对了，睁钱很容易”。县府最近又召开了工商业资本家座谈会，帮助他们研究今后如何发展工商业，繁荣市场。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Northeast, 29th—The Tongbei Farm and the Songjiang Provincial First Farm, operated by the Northeast Administrative Committee, have achieved significant results in using tractors for land reclamation. The two farms have recently reclaimed and sown nearly 2,000 hectares (one hectare equals ten mu) in a short period. The tractors used in the Tongbei Farm are all medium-sized machines with 45 horsepower. Additionally, over 40 horses and four large plows were used. During reclamation, an average of eleven tractors were deployed daily, using a method of arranging them in a line and reclaiming land in a circular pattern, which not only saves gasoline but also allows for mutual communication and response, saving time and reclaiming more land. When each tractor tows 20,000 jin of weight on a dry, hard road, the speed is twelve li per hour. If the soil moisture is suitable, towing a four-铧 (four-bladed) large plow can reclaim eight hectares per hour; towing a five-铧 or six-铧 large plow can reclaim more than sixteen hectares per hour. (Note: Although five-铧 and six-铧 plows are heavier than four-铧 plows, they still do not exceed the horsepower limit of medium-sized tractors, and the speed reduction is not significant. Five-铧 plows have a larger plowing surface, while four-铧 plows have a smaller plowing surface, so towing a five-铧 plow reclaims more land than towing a four-铧 plow.) If calculated on the basis of ten hours of work per day, compared to the productivity of ordinary farmers who can only reclaim six mu per day with four horses pulling a foreign plow, the rate can generally be increased by at least 130 to 260 times. The reclaimed land is then pulverized by machines. Each pulverizer carries forty circular harrows, and can harrow twenty-six hectares in ten hours. However, due to the wet ground this year, in order to avoid mud and increase the difficulty of using machinery, attention was paid to land selection and surveying before reclamation. The farm has more than 140 staff members, including more than ten experienced technicians and more than 40 newly trained young trainees, who are now able to fully master driving skills and carry out simple repairs. In the reclamation process, due to the launch of labor emulation drives and the appropriate attention given to everyone's lives during the shock work, the production enthusiasm of the entire farm is extremely high, and daily labor often exceeds fourteen hours. Driver Sun Hongbo drove tractor No. 101 and reclaimed more than one hundred hectares of land in one day, and refused to get off the machine, requesting to continue working the night shift. Under the shock work of the workers, the farm has completed the plan of sowing 1,200 hectares of crops such as rice.\n　　The Songjiang Provincial First Farm also quickly completed the land reclamation task in a shock competition. The farm has a total of eight tractors, fifty plowing horses, four four-铧 plows, three three-铧 plows, nine horse-drawn foreign plows, six pulverizers, one large row seeder, and many other farm implements. There are sixty tractor team members (mostly newly trained young students) and eighty farming team members. Every day, four tractors are used for land reclamation, and three others are used for pulverizing and sowing, averaging forty hectares of land reclaimed and sown per day. The farm started plowing in mid-May, and in half a month, more than 600 hectares of soybeans, sugar beets, and other crops were reclaimed and sown. It is now working hard to continue to complete the task of rush-planting 800 hectares of land.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 通北松江公营农场　拖拉机开荒成绩显著  两农场短期内开荒播种二千垧\n\n1948-07-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　通北松江公营农场\n    拖拉机开荒成绩显著\n    两农场短期内开荒播种二千垧\n    【新华社东北廿九日电】东北行政委员会经营的通北农场及松江省营第一农场，使用拖拉机开荒，已获显著成绩。两场已于最近短期内开荒播种近两千垧（一垧十亩），通北农场所用拖拉机均为四十五匹马力的中型机。另用马四十余匹，大犁四付。开荒中每天平均出动十一台拖拉机，采用排成一列，纵深转圈开荒的办法，不仅能节省汽油，而且能互相联络呼应，节省时间，多开荒地。每台拖拉机在干硬道上拖运两万斤重量时，速度为每小时十二里。如地皮干湿相宜，拖四铧大犁，每小时能开荒八垧；拖五铧或六铧大犁，则每小时能开十六垧以上。（按五铧、六铧犁虽比四铧犁重，但仍不超过中型拖拉机的马力限度，速力减损不大。五铧犁开垦面大，匹铧犁开垦面小，因此拖五铧犁比拖四铧犁开荒多）。如一天以劳作十小时计算，则较普通农民以四马套一付洋犁，每天仅能开荒六亩的生产率，一般均能至少提高一百三十倍至二百六十倍以上。开过的地再用机器碎土。每台碎土机带四十片圆耙，每十小时能耙地二十六垧。但因今年地湿，为避免泥泞增加使用机器的困难，因而开荒前曾注意了选地测地的工作。该场工作人员共一百四十余人，其中除雇用的十余名熟练技术人员外，并有新近训练的青年学员四十余人，现在他们已能完全掌握驾驶技术，并能进行简单的修理工作。在开荒中，由于发动了劳动竞赛，领导上又适当照顾了大家在突击中的生活，故全场生产情绪极高，每天劳作常在十四小时以上。司机孙鸿波驾驶一○一号拖拉机，一天开了荒地百余垧，还不肯下机，要求继续作夜班。在工友们突击劳作下，该场已完成播种稻子等作物一千二百垧的计划。\n    松江省营第一农场亦在突击竞赛中迅速完成了开荒任务。该场共有拖拉机八架，耕马五十匹，四铧犁四架，三铧犁三架，马拉洋犁九付，碎土机六架，大条播种机一架，及其他许多农具。有拖拉机队员六十名（多为新培养的青年学生），耕作队八十名。每日以四架拖拉机开荒，另三架碎土、播种，平均每天可开荒播种四十垧。该场五月中旬开犁，半月中即开荒播种大豆、甜菜等六百余垧，现正为继续完成抢种八百垧地而努力。"

This cooperative was formed in August of last year by Wang Jindong, the director of the trade union, and nine carpenters. Each person invested labor as shares, and profits were distributed according to shares. In the early stages, due to a lack of capital and raw materials, they relied solely on outside work, building diligently. Later, everyone pooled together 135,000 yuan in wages (Jicha, same below) to buy six rooms (including three storefronts). In November, they obtained a low-interest loan of 200,000 yuan from the bank to purchase raw materials. Since then, they have been doing both outside and inside work. By the end of the year, after settling accounts, in addition to each person earning a net wage of 1,500 yuan per day, each person was also able to receive a dividend of more than 30,000 yuan. Seeing the benefits, three more carpenters joined. This spring, they obtained another loan of 360,000 yuan from the bank to expand their business.

According to understanding during the sowing period, the \"811\" millet has been widely promoted in the three special districts and the Xiangyuan, Yushe, and Wuxiang counties of the second special district. In the Xia Village base point of Licheng, the \"811\" millet planted in eight villages accounted for 22% of the total millet land. In order to enable the masses to master the technology of planting \"811\" millet, increase yields, and avoid losses, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has made unified arrangements with party and government leaders at all levels, deciding to go deep into the base points, guide the masses, and summarize and exchange experiences. At each base point village, one to three specially invited farmers are planned to be established to set an example, and through them to connect with the masses, so that everyone believes in technology and improves technology. They also organize the masses to topdress. According to actual inspections, this year's previous stage of cultivation was very rough, some places sowed without plowing, and fertilizers were generally not applied as much as last year. In order to make up for this shortcoming, in addition to publicizing and organizing the masses to topdress, the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau also worked with the masses to study how to obtain fertilizer more and faster, and how to apply it well and effectively, based on local actual conditions and conditions. They also help the masses to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and test local agents. Since the beginning of spring, due to unfavorable climate, rough work, and unscientific application of manure, insect pests have developed. In Anju Village, Lucheng, more than 300 mu of jade corn was bitten to death by insects. After replanting, there are still insect pests. The Agricultural and Forestry Bureau decided to concentrate some forces, cooperate with the local government, go to the pest-stricken area to establish temporary base points, and organize the masses to fight against insect pests. And make several kinds of local agents: such as Yangtao root,椿tree bark root, tobacco stem water,藜芦, Pinellia and other single agents and mixed agents, first do experiments, get experience and then gradually improve. They also organize the masses to select wheat seeds and promote them locally. This year, \"169\" wheat has generally developed jaundice, and in some areas the seeds are not pure. In places where jaundice is severe year after year and the masses are unwilling to plant, do not emphasize replanting, and organize the masses to select other local excellent varieties. If they are willing to plant, they will organize seed selection, pull out the miscellaneous ears, and harvest them separately. Choose local excellent wheat varieties, and adopt the seed selection method of Lao Ying and Li Shun last autumn: take the village as a unit, let the masses visit the fields, and after everyone agrees, organize the masses to select seeds and promote them locally.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长治农林局干部下乡　帮助群众提高生产技术\n\n1948-07-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长治农林局干部下乡\n    帮助群众提高生产技术\n    【太行讯】长治农林局农林组，总结了春耕下种技术工作后，立即订出下一段工作计划。六月三日，农林组十人全部下乡，分别到黎（城）、潞（城）、襄（垣）、长（治）等县帮助群众改进生产技术。据下种期间的了解，三专各县及二专襄垣、榆社、武乡等县，“八一一”谷已普遍推广。黎城霞庄基点八个村所种“八一一”谷占谷地总数百分之二十二。为了使群众掌握种植“八一一”谷的技术，增加产量，避免损失，农林局已和各级党政领导作了统一布置，决定深入基点，指导群众，总结交流经验。在各基点村有计划的建立一至三户特约农家，做出榜样来，通过他们去连系群众，使大家相信技术，提高技术。他们同时组织群众上追肥。根据实际检查，今年前一段的耕作很不精细，部分地方没犁地就下了种，肥料普遍没有去年上的多。为弥补这个缺点，农林局除了宣传组织群众上追肥外，并和群众根据当地实际情况和条件，研究如何做到肥料来的又多又快，上的好，起作用。他们也帮助群众防除病虫害，试验土药剂。入春以来，因气候不和，工作粗糙，上粪不科学，致虫害发展。潞城安居一村，即有三百多亩玉茭被虫咬死，重种后仍有虫害。农林局决集中一部分力量，配合当地政府，到虫害区建立临时基点，组织群众向虫害作斗争。并作出几种土药剂：如杨桃根、椿树皮根、烟茎水、藜卢、半夏等单剂与混合剂，先作试验，取得经验再逐步提高。他们也组织群众进行小麦选种，就地推广。“一六九”小麦今年普遍发生黄疸，有些地区种子不纯了。在连年黄疸严重，群众不愿种的地方，不强调再种，组织群众另选本地优良品种。愿种地的则组织选种，拔掉杂穗，单割单打。选择本地小麦优良品种，采用劳英李顺去年秋天的选种办法：以村为单位，让群众田间参观，大家同意后，再组织群众选种，就地推广。"

According to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on the 28th, Wang Yun-wu, the Minister of Finance of the Chiang government, has been forced to resign due to his inability to control prices.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海市场益形混乱　传王云五将被迫辞职\n\n1948-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海市场益形混乱\n    传王云五将被迫辞职\n    【新华社陕北三日电】六月二十五、二十六两日的上海物价暴涨，曾使市场陷于空前的混乱。综合各外国通讯社消息：二十六日，黄金每两为蒋币二亿一千万元，较二十五日又涨一千万元。一双鞋子，十六日前价值七百万元，现在则要五千万元，一包“好运道”牌香烟要八十万元，一般小康之家爱吸的英国制的“黑猫”牌或“三五”牌香烟每包更在百万元以上。据统计：面粉、大米、棉纱、白布、肥皂、火柴、纸烟六月下旬之前七天上涨了百分之六十到八十，批发价格较六月一日上涨百分之二百（合众社沪二十七日电）。据路透社报导，国民党市政府已于二十七日下令，在新的训令发出以前，粮食市场包括大米、面粉、谷类和食油，一律停止交易。该社称，上海工人已因物价暴涨而陷于不安，他们已要求生活指数每半月改订一次，并以逐日上升的米价而不是以每周米价为根据。另据美联社南京二十八日电：蒋政府财政部长王云五已因无能控制物价，而被迫提出辞职。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 3rd: The Central Plains Field Army's political work conference at the brigade level and above has successfully concluded a few days ago. The Political Department of the East China Field Army also sent special personnel to participate. At the meeting, Comrade Song Renqiong conveyed Chairman Mao's and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instructions on the domestic and international situation, tasks, the prospects for revolutionary victory, and various policies. The representatives present were extremely excited, and their understanding of the policies was greatly helped. Subsequently, Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping, based on Chairman Mao's and the Central Committee's policy instructions for the new district, reviewed some of the past hasty approaches in the Central Plains work that stemmed from subjective desires and failed to proceed from reality. He emphasized the specific steps for implementing policies such as rent reduction, interest reduction, and reasonable burden in the region in the future, enabling everyone to gain a unified and correct understanding of the basic situation and policies of the new district. Commander Liu Bocheng, after explaining the great strategic significance of our army's leap into the Central Plains, pointed out that we should summarize the experience of the new district work, study the Party's policies, and unite the broad forces of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism; within the troops, we should implement and promote the new-style military consolidation policy of democracy, overcome the troops' shortcomings, improve tactics and techniques, and educate every soldier to obey the leadership of the Party committee, strive for progress, eliminate Chiang's troops in the Central Plains, liberate the entire Central Plains, and prepare to continue marching forward. Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun, based on the task of completely liberating the Central Plains and continuing the advance, proposed how to continue implementing the new-style military consolidation, strengthen fighting spirit, strengthen the leadership of the Party committee and the work of the political organs and branches, how to ensure the correct implementation of the Party's policies, how to combine the mass movement of the central task with routine work, and how to implement regular work inspection, summarization, and reporting, and other issues, and submitted them to the meeting for discussion. The above work was discussed in a relatively profound manner at the meeting, and common understanding and specific implementation methods were obtained. At the end of the meeting, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang made a summary based on the issues discussed. Everyone unanimously believed that this meeting would greatly promote future work in the Central Plains.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中原召开政工会议　传达中央指示检讨总结新区工作经验号召提高战斗力消灭蒋军准备继续前进\n\n1948-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中原召开政工会议\n    传达中央指示检讨总结新区工作经验号召提高战斗力消灭蒋军准备继续前进\n    【新华社中原前线三日电】中原野战军召开的旅以上政治工作会议，已于日前胜利闭幕。华东野战军政治部亦派专人参加。会上宋任穷同志传达了毛主席和刘少奇同志关于国内外形势、任务、革命胜利前途和各种政策指示，到会代表皆极为兴奋，对政策的认识亦得到极大的帮助。继由邓小平政委根据毛主席和中央对新区政策指示，检讨了过去中原工作中曾经存在过的从主观愿望出发，不从实际出发的某种急性病。他着重说明了今后该区实行减租减息与合理负担等政策的具体步骤，使大家对新区基本情况和政策获得统一的正确认识。刘伯承司令员在会上说明我军跃进中原的伟大战略意义后，指出应总结新区工作经验，研究党的政策，团结广大反帝反封建反官僚资本的力量；在部队内应贯彻发扬民主的新式整军方针，克服部队不良现象，提高战术、技术，并教育每个军人必须服从党委领导，力求进步，消灭中原蒋军，解放全部中原，准备继续向前进军。张际春副政委根据全部解放中原与继续进军的任务，提出如何继续实行新式整军，加强斗志，加强党委领导和政治机关工作、支部工作，如何保证正确执行党的政策，如何使中心工作的群众性运动与经常工作相结合，及如何实施经常的工作检查、总结、报告等问题，交给会议讨论。会上对于上述工作都作了比较深刻的讨论，亦均得到共同的认识和具体实施的方法。会末由张副政委根据讨论问题，作出总结。大家一致认为此次会议对今后中原工作将起极大的推动作用。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Democratic Voluntary Mutual Aid\n\n　　Oppose Formalism\n　　Tunliu Organizes Small-Scale Mutual Aid\n　　[Taiyue News] On June 19th, Tunliu Second District convened a meeting of labor heroes, production models, and experienced mutual aid team leaders to review and criticize the past formalism of large-scale, bustling mutual aid organizations, and proposed small-scale mutual aid methods. Twenty-eight people, including labor hero Gao Yunting, attended. The leadership first made a self-criticism, admitting that they had not properly guided and cultivated them in the past period of production, causing losses in production, and asked them to offer more opinions on the current production work. During the discussion, three problems were identified in the current production mutual aid that urgently needed to be resolved: (1) Large-scale mutual aid organizations sometimes not only fail to promote production but also cause some opposite results. Wei Yubin of Xipo Village said: \"There are too many people in a group in the south ditch of our village. Last spring, fifteen people went to weed the fields, weeding one family after another. By the time they finished weeding one round, the weeds that were weeded first had grown back.\" Xu Goudan of the same village had a group of six or seven people who would divide into two or three plots to weed during busy times, weeding quickly and in a timely manner. After finishing their own fields, they also weeded more than ten mu for military families. Some teams have too many people, and everyone is anxious to weed their own land. When weeding for others, they become perfunctory, not weeding the weeds thoroughly and weeding too shallowly. It is also very time-consuming to record work points when there are too many people. The large team in Xu Village spent half a day calculating accounts every five days for twenty people, which adds up to eight or nine workdays. Some groups are too large, and the team leaders are too busy, causing too many mistakes and not being able to work themselves, so some people are unwilling to be team leaders. Production leadership then becomes unorganized. (2) Some groups force work exchanges, and work accounts are not clear. Last year, the Yuli Mutual Aid Brigade forced a disorderly harvest of wheat, making it impossible to record work points. The accounts have not been cleared from last year until now. The head of the Shangcun Mutual Aid Brigade forced women to till nine mu of land for a lazy man. Because of their weak labor, everyone was unwilling, so they dug carelessly, spending fifty-eight workdays and receiving one stone and seven dou of wages in rice. The lazy man was unwilling to pay, and the work accounts have not been cleared until now. These problems have not been well resolved. This year, when the leadership announced that mutual aid must be voluntary, some groups disbanded; some large mutual aid groups still exist in name but actually have three or five people exchanging work with each other; some are based on the old mutual aid groups but with some people leaving, and the old members are still working together; some are completely reorganized. Those who attended the meeting unanimously agreed that small-scale mutual aid is good, making it easier to solve issues such as voluntariness, recording work points, equivalent exchange, and leadership. It was decided at the meeting to universally organize small-scale mutual aid. Now, these two tasks will be done first: (1) Exchanging work with each other should not be too formal and not too large. People can work on their own during slack times and exchange work during busy times. This method can take care of everyone's scattered work such as watering gardens and planting melons, and can also flexibly continue mutual aid for a long time. If someone is sent away on errands, it will also be convenient for others to take care of their family's farming. (2) Reorganize existing mutual aid groups, clear old accounts, voluntarily combine, democratically elect team leaders, and everyone decides on wages.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对形式主义　屯留组织小型互助\n\n1948-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：民主自愿结合互助\n\n　　反对形式主义\n    屯留组织小型互助\n    【太岳讯】屯留二区在六月十九日召开劳动英雄、生产模范及有经验的互助组长会议，检查批判过去形式主义凑热闹的大队大组的互助形式，提出小型互助办法。到劳动英雄高云亭等二十八人。领导上首先作了检讨，承认在过去一段生产中没有好好领导培养他们，使生产受了损失，请他们对目前的生产工作多提意见。在讨论中，检查出目前生产互助中有三个问题亟待解决：（一）大队大组的互助组织，有时不但不能起推动生产的作用，反而会引起一些相反的结果。西泼村魏玉斌说：“俺村南沟的一组人太多了，去年春天十五个人去锄地，一家挨一家的锄，轮流锄完一遍时，先锄的草又长起来荒了”。该村许狗旦的一个组六、七个人，在紧活时就分开两三块锄，锄得又快又及时，锄完了自己的，还给军属锄了十几亩。有些组队人太多了，大家都急着想锄自己的地，给别人锄时就敷衍起来，草锄不尽，又锄得浅。人多了记工时也很误工，许村的大组五天一算帐，二十个人就得误半天功夫，合起来就是八九个工。有些组太大，组长太忙，误事太多，又不能顶工，有些人不愿当组长。生产领导就自流了。（二）有些组强迫变工，工帐算不清。峪里的互助大队，去年割麦强迫打乱割，就没法记工，去年到现在就没清帐。上村互助大队长强迫妇女给一个懒汉垡了九亩地，因为劳力弱，大家又不愿意，马马虎虎挖了一下，费了五十八个工，得一石七斗工资米。懒汉不愿意拿，工帐到现在也没弄清。这些问题一直没得到很好解决。在今年领导上宣布互助一定要自愿时，有的组就散伙了；有的大互助组形式上虽然还存在，实际是三个五个人互相拨工；有的是在旧互助组的基础上去了一些人，旧人还在一块劳动；有的是完全重新结合。到会者一致认为小型互助好，容易解决自愿、记工、等价及领导等等问题。会上决定普遍组织小型互助。现在先作这两个工作：（１）互相拨工不拘形式，不要太大，闲时可以各干各的，忙时互相拨工。这种办法能照顾每个人浇园、种瓜等零碎活，又能灵活的长期互助下去。有人支差走了，家里的活别人也便于照顾耕种。（２）整理旧有互助组，清理旧帐，自愿结合，民主选组长，大家决定工资。"

This year's harvest is better than in previous years. The flatlands can yield five or six \"da dou\" (each \"dou\" is 26 jin) per mu, with some yielding as much as one \"shi\"; even the mountainous areas can yield three or four \"dou\" per mu. During the wheat harvest, the Jishan County Government transferred more than 120 staff members and 36 mules and horses to the countryside to help military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and widowers and orphans with the harvest.\n    During breaks from fighting, a certain artillery company of the East China Liberation Army helped the masses with the wheat harvest, reaping 34 mu in one day. The sickles and other farm tools of the masses in the suburbs of Chengwu County, Luxinan, were looted by the Chiang bandits. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Liberation Army, who were helping with the harvest, pulled the wheat by hand. The medical team and stretcher platoon of a certain unit harvested 20 mu in three hours. The political department of a certain unit stipulated that cadres and odd-job men should help the masses with production for two hours each day. In one afternoon, they threshed the wheat of eight military families in the village and delivered it to their homes.\n    This spring, Shandong had sufficient rainfall, and the seedlings were strong and weeds were plentiful. Farmers actively engaged in mutual aid and labor exchange to seize the time for summer hoeing. In the fifth district of Cangshan (new county, southwest of Linyi), Lunnan, most of the 40,000 mu of sorghum had been hoed for the first time by mid-May. In order to solve the problem of food shortages during the summer hoeing season, the Cangshan Democratic Government specially distributed 59,000 jin of river work relief and relief grain; the Dayu district of Mengyin, Luzhong, invested 4.5 million yuan from the government's purchase of firewood and grass into sideline production.\n    This year, Jin Sui also has sufficient rainfall, and various places are mobilizing farmers to hoe early, hoe deeply, and hoe often. The local government has prioritized issuing loans of grain to solve the problem of food shortages for farmers during the summer hoeing season. In Ermaying, Beitun, Mafang and other places in Ningwu, farmers have adopted a relay transportation method to solve the problem of food shortages. Each village transports a section, departing before dawn and returning at breakfast, which does not delay weeding and saves travel expenses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各解放区夏收夏锄简讯\n\n1948-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各解放区夏收夏锄简讯\n    晋南河津、稷山、新绛、汾城等县九十万亩麦田已胜利完成收割入仓。今年收成比往年好，平地每亩可收五、六大斗（每斗二十六斤），多的收到一石；山地每亩也可收三、四斗。麦收时，稷山县政府曾抽调机关人员一百二十多名、骡马三十六头下乡帮助军、烈属和鳏寡孤独收割。\n    华东解放军某炮兵连在战斗间隙中，帮助群众麦收，一天收了三十四亩。鲁西南城武县城郊群众的镰刀等农具被蒋匪抢光，帮助收割的解放军某部指战员就用手拔麦。某部卫生队和担架排两个单位三小时就拔了二十亩。某部政治部规定机关干部和杂勤人员每天每人帮助群众生产两小时，他们在一个下午便将驻村八户军属麦子打好，送到家里。\n    山东今春雨水充足，苗旺草多，农民纷纷变工互助抓紧夏锄。鲁南苍山（新县，临沂西南）五区四万亩高粱到五月中大部已锄完头遍。为了解决夏锄中的口粮困难，苍山民主政府特发放河工代赈和救济粮五万九千斤；鲁中蒙阴大崮区将政府收购柴草款四百五十万元投入副业生产。\n    晋绥今年雨水也很充足，各地正发动农民早锄、深锄、多锄。当地政府已有重点的发放贷粮，解决农民夏锄口粮困难。宁武二马营北屯马坊等地农民为解决口粮，采用接力运输办法，每村运输一段，天不明出发，早饭时返回，既不耽误锄草，又节省路费。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北三日电】"

    "content": "Taihang Labor Hero Li Shunda\n    Firmly Believes in the Party's Policies and Strives for Production and Prosperity\n    [Taihang News] Taihang Labor Hero Li Shunda (Secretary of the Shadi Zhan Branch in the Second District of Pingshun, from Xigou Natural Village) firmly believes that the Party's policy of developing production will not change. Since the beginning of spring, while many people have experienced ideological turmoil and confusion, he has steadfastly implemented the Party's slogan of \"getting rich\" and has actively worked to build his household. As a result, his five-year construction plan has been largely completed after two and a half years of effort. Li Shunda originally turned over a new leaf through rent and interest reduction in 1942 and became prosperous during the Great Production Movement in 1944, living a relatively affluent life. By 1946, his family owned two cave dwellings, three earthen houses, fifty mu of land (twenty mu of flat land and thirty mu of hillside land), one donkey, two pigs, and forty sheep. In order to improve his life further, he formulated a five-year construction plan that year, planning to build three western-style houses in 1946, three eastern-style houses in 1947, two sheds in 1948, repair three cave dwellings in 1949, and dig a well and build a millstone in 1950. Within five years, he planned to sew a new quilt for each person, have a full set of clothing, a felt rug for each kang (platform bed), raise eighty sheep, feed a mule, and make two hand-pulled shuttle looms and five double-wheeled spinning wheels. After the plan was formulated, he actively worked towards its implementation. According to a recent inspection, significant progress has been made in two and a half years (from 1946 to June 1948), including the construction of two eastern-style houses, two sheds, a millstone, a well, three hand-pulled shuttle looms, nine double-wheeled spinning wheels, an additional forty sheep, a new quilt for each person, a full set of clothing, and six felt rugs. His construction plan is nearing completion. In agriculture, due to his constant research into techniques, his entire family has purchased improved varieties, engaged in deep plowing and careful cultivation, hoeing and applying manure frequently. As a result, the annual hoeing always exceeds the required amount by several times. In 1946, he achieved a surplus of one after plowing two, and in 1947, he had already achieved a surplus of one after plowing one. In addition to continuing to complete the five-year plan, he has now formulated a new plan to build three more threshing grounds, increase the number of sheep to one hundred, expand agricultural investment, build more embankments, and further increase production. Shunda often says to people, \"We are not satisfied with just having enough to eat; we want to have everything we need!\" Comrade Li Shunda is also a model for implementing the Party's policies. In leading the entire village in production, in addition to influencing everyone with his own exemplary actions, he often patiently persuades the masses and solves their ideological and practical problems. After the Land Law Outline was issued, the masses were unsure of what to do, which once caused ideological confusion and affected production. Shunda quickly convened a meeting of Party members to explain the Party's policies. He said, \"We Party members must believe in the Party's policies and publicize them to the masses, explaining that the Land Law Outline only aims to eliminate feudalism and develop production, and it does not target middle peasants.\" He also said, \"We in Pingshun have already eliminated feudalism, and the poor peasants and hired laborers have turned over a new leaf. There will be no more struggle, so everyone should focus on production.\" After the Party members separately publicized this policy of the Party, they first stabilized the emotions of the middle peasants. Later, they also publicized the \"whoever sows, reaps\" announcement in the newspapers, boosting everyone's enthusiasm for production. In rectifying mutual aid, he led everyone to improve the past unreasonable phenomenon of exchanging labor between people and animals, disbanded the large mutual aid groups that were inconvenient to operate, and re-formed small groups under the principle of true democracy and voluntarism, which increased everyone's enthusiasm for mutual aid production. Now, no household in the entire village does not participate in mutual aid. Under the influence of his active engagement in production and continuous publicity and explanation of the Party's policies, the ideological confusion of the masses was quickly overcome, and the enthusiasm for production never slackened, enabling the entire village to sow on time this year, and also to reclaim twenty-one mu of wasteland, earning a lot of money from sideline production during the gaps in agricultural production. He is now leading the masses in hoeing seedlings and harvesting wheat.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行劳动英雄李顺达　坚信党的政策努力生产发家\n\n1948-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行劳动英雄李顺达\n    坚信党的政策努力生产发家\n    【太行讯】太行劳动英雄李顺达（平顺二区沙地栈支部书记，西沟自然村人），坚信党的发展生产政策不会变更，入春以来，许多群众思想动荡混乱，他仍非常坚定的贯彻执行党所提出的发家致富的口号，积极努力建设家务，使他的五年建设计划，经过两年半的努力，已大部完成。李顺达原是经过一九四二年减租减息翻了身，一九四四年大生产运动中发了家，过着比较富裕的生活，到四六年时，全家有窑二孔、土房三间、土地五十亩（平地二十亩，坡地三十亩），养驴一头，猪两头，羊四十只。为了把时光过的更好，当年他又订出了五年建设计划，准备在一九四六年要盖西平房三间，一九四七年盖东平房三间，一九四八年修厦棚两间，一九四九年修补窑三孔，一九五○年打水井一眼，建碾子一盘，在五年内每人缝新被子一条，有一身长余衣服，每一个炕上铺毡子一领，养羊八十只，再喂骡子一头、做手拉梭织布机两架，双轮纺车五辆。自订出计划后，即积极努力进行建设。据最近检查，二年半时间（一九四六年至四八年六月）已做出了很大成绩，计修起东楼二间，厦棚两间，碾子一盘，水井一眼，手拉梭机三架，双轮纺车九辆，新发展羊四十只，每人做新被子一条，长余衣服一身，毛毡六领，他的建设计划将近全部完成。在农业上由于他经常研究技术，全家已购置改良品种，进行深耕细作，多锄多上粪，结果每年总是超过应锄量几倍以上，一九四六年达到耕二余一，一九四七年则已达到耕一余一了。他除要继续完成五年计划外，现又订出了新的计划，准备再修场房三间，羊发展到一百只，扩大农业投资，多修边垒堰，更增加产量。顺达常常对人说：“我们不光闹的够吃就满足了，要闹的用甚有甚就好了”。李顺达同志又是执行党的政策的模范，他在领导全村生产上，除用自己的模范行动影响大家外，并经常耐心的说服群众，解决群众的思想与实际问题；土地法大纲下来后，群众不摸底，曾一度引起思想混乱，影响着生产，顺达便迅速召开了党员大会，说明党的政策。他说：“我们党员一定要相信党的政策，并向群众宣传党的政策，说明土地法大纲只是消灭封建，目的在于发展生产，是不斗争中农的。”他并说：“我们平顺早已消灭了封建，贫雇都已翻身，不会再来一个斗争，大家应安心生产。”党员分头宣传了党的这一政策后，首先稳定了中农的情绪。后来并宣传了报纸上的“谁种谁收”，发展生产的布告，更鼓起了大家的生产劲头。在整顿互助中，他领导大家改进了过去人畜变工的不合理现象，解散了活动不便的大互助组，在真正民主自愿原则下，又重新结合成小组，提高了大家互助生产的积极性，现在全村无一户不参加互助。在他积极经营生产及不断宣传解释党的政策的影响下，群众的思想混乱很快即被克服下去，生产劲头从未松懈，使全村今年按时下了种，并开荒廿一亩，在农业生产的空隙中搞副业生产赚钱很多。他现在正领导群众进行锄苗麦收。"

Before withdrawing from Kaifeng, the Political Department of the PLA Front Headquarters issued a proclamation to people from all walks of life in Kaifeng, thanking the people of Kaifeng for their enthusiastic support of the PLA's operations and for cooperating with the PLA in restoring order in the city, expressing condolences to the compatriots who were victimized by enemy bombing and looting, and explaining that the final victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war is not far away. This withdrawal is for the purpose of facilitating the search for opportunities to annihilate the enemy on a larger scale, so as to finally liberate Kaifeng.\n\n　　Note: One of the military principles of the People's Liberation Army proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China in his report last December is to take the annihilation of the enemy's effective strength as the main goal of operations. Conserving or capturing cities is the result of annihilating the enemy's effective strength, and it often takes repeated attempts to finally conserve or capture them. In the past, the PLA quickly and actively withdrew from major cities such as Luoyang and Yuncheng after the first liberation, and soon occupied them again.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 完成大量歼敌任务我军主动撤离开封\n\n1948-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　完成大量歼敌任务我军主动撤离开封\n    【新华社开封前线六月二十七日电】（迟到）人民解放军于六月二十六日主动撤离开封。解放军前线司令部政治部于撤离开封前曾发布告开封各界人士的文告，感谢热烈支援解放军作战及协同解放军恢复市内秩序的开封人民，慰问在敌人轰炸、焚掠下被难的同胞，并说明中国人民革命战争最后胜利已为期不远，此次撤离，是为了便于寻找战机，更大量地歼灭敌人，以便最后解放开封。\n    按：中共毛泽东主席在去年十二月报告中所提出的人民解放军军事原则之一，即为以歼灭敌有生力量为作战主要目标，保守或夺取城市，是歼灭敌人有生力量的结果，往往须要反复多次才能最后的保守或夺取之。解放军过去对于洛阳、运城等大城市，均曾于第一次解放后迅即主动撤离，而不久即再度占领。"

The personnel in charge of the Confucius Mansion were able to stay at their posts in peace, and all kinds of ancient objects and treasures were preserved intact. The troops attacking the city issued rules for entering the city several days before the attack; after entering the East Gate at midnight on the 11th, they repeatedly ordered all units to pay special attention to protecting ancient sites and cultural relics when advancing deeper into the city. After the remnants of the enemy entrenched in the Confucius Mansion were wiped out, the attacking troops immediately withdrew outside the city, and the garrison troops designated by the headquarters guarded the ancient sites separately. After the battle, the unit immediately sent a team to tidy up the gardens and clean up the bases, post stations, and other places in the Confucius Temple, and officially opened it for visitors. The personnel in charge of the Confucius Mansion said: \"The garrison troops issued a bulletin immediately after entering the city, which made us determined to stay at our posts and perform our duties with peace of mind.\" The Kong Family Cemetery (Kong Lin) north of the city had been severely damaged because several thousand people, including the KMT's \"Home Return Corps,\" had been living there.

Many doors and windows in the Yan Temple and Yan Mansion in the north gate of Qufu had been dismantled by the KMT troops for firewood.

According to the pond keeper, \"It will take at least five years for the pond lotus to recover from this destruction.\" The Confucius Temple in Qufu has magnificent architecture. The Dacheng Hall is eight zhang high and fourteen zhang wide.

The mutual aid team leaders were designated by village cadres, and the members were assigned to participate in each group. Mutual aid was just a formality; they were together during meetings, but each did their own work. Although some groups did work together, they were careless about equivalent exchange; some did not keep accounts, saying superficially that it was fine, as long as the work was done, but in reality, everyone was afraid of doing more. Some groups had wages that were too low, usually one and a half sheng of rice per work-day in normal times, and one sheng of rice in winter, so no one was interested in mutual aid. On June 12th, at the night school, the mutual aid organization was reorganized. The village cadres first explained: the past organization of mutual aid in Nanpo was not voluntary, which made the work difficult to carry out and the enthusiasm for production was not high. This reorganization will change the method, first allowing everyone to freely organize and combine, and then electing the team leader. After speaking, he let the masses form groups. The masses raised the opinion, \"To be asked to form groups today, everyone is not prepared, and we are afraid that we will not be able to form them well. It is better to go back and let everyone discuss it properly.\" At this time, the cadres also realized that they were still using an administrative order style, and immediately accepted the opinions of the masses. After two days of free discussion, everyone's opinions were prepared, and on the 14th, group formation was carried out again, with each group consisting of five or six families, and democratically elected those who usually worked well and were fair-minded as the group leader. This voluntary combination excluded some people who did not like to work. Lu Wudui said regretfully, \"In the past, I still had a group, but now with free combination, I don't even have a group.\" Everyone said, \"This is true democratic voluntarism!\" Wages were also increased to two and a half sheng of rice, regardless of meals. On the 16th, the new mutual aid team arranged the wheat harvesting work, and on the 17th, they began to cut wheat. Everyone's enthusiasm for production increased, and in four days, they completed the cutting of all 534 mu of wheat fields in the village (including threshing). They are now planting carrots and hoeing the second batch of millet seedlings.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 打破强迫组织的一套　南坡群众自由结组\n\n1948-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：民主自愿结合互助\n\n　　打破强迫组织的一套\n    南坡群众自由结组\n    【太岳讯】阳城三区西峪属南坡自然村的互助组，去年按照成份行政命令的组织起来，互助组长由村干部指定，组员听凭分配参加各组。互助只是个形式，开会时在一起，做活却各干各的。有的组虽然互助做活，但是等价交换很马虎，有的不记帐，表面上说没有啥，把活做完就好，实际上谁也怕多做了。有的组工资太低，平时一工一升半米，冬天一升米，谁对互助也不感兴趣。六月十二日夜校上，重新整顿互助组织，村干部先讲明：南坡过去组织互助不是自愿的，弄的工作不好进行，生产劲头不大。这次整顿要改变办法，先由大家自由组织结合，再选组长，说完就让群众编组。群众提出意见说：“今天一下叫结组，大家没有准备，怕还结不好，还是回去好好让大家自己商量着办。”这时干部也觉着自己仍是行政命令的作风，马上接受了群众意见。经过两天的自由商量，大家的意见准备好了，十四日又进行结组，每组五、六家，民主选出平时劳动好的为人公正的当组长。这次自愿结合，过去有些不爱劳动的人就被群众结合掉了。路五堆很后悔的说：“过去咱还有个组，现在自由结合，咱连个组也没有了。”大家却说：“这才是真正的民主自愿哩！”工资也提高到二升半米，不管吃。十六日新互助组布置收麦工作，十七日开始割麦，大家生产劲头提高了，四天工夫就把全村麦地五百三十四亩全部割完（连打场）。现正种红萝卜，锄二遍谷苗。"

The directly subordinate organs and troops of the Jinsui Military Region began to study the Party's policies in a planned and step-by-step manner last month. First, study Chairman Mao's \"Speech at the Cadre Conference in Shanxi-Suiyuan,\" in order to understand the Party's general line and general policy. Later, they will study Comrade Ren Bishi's report \"Several Issues in Land Reform,\" \"Two Documents of 1933,\" and urban policies, etc., and finally study the Central Committee's \"Instructions on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948,\" Chapter 2 of \"Left-Wing Infantilism.\" During the study, they will connect with the inspection of the work and thoughts of the agency and themselves. According to the person in charge of the Military Region's Political Department, the study of the Party's policies in the troops has been in a state of laissez-faire for a long time in the past, especially since the \"Three Check-ups.\" The atmosphere of policy study is weak, and whether to read the documents, or read more or less, depends entirely on personal interests. At the political work meeting held in May, representatives of various troops also reflected that when reading Party newspapers in the troops, they only read domestic and foreign military and political news, but rarely read news about land reform and party consolidation, believing that it had little to do with the troops. The result of this neglect of policy study and neglect of Party newspapers has led to serious ideological errors in some comrades on certain specific policies of the Party; some troops in the new areas have directly violated the Party's policies in their actions, damaging the interests of the people and the prestige of the Party. After severely criticizing this phenomenon, the military region leaders pointed out that this purely military viewpoint that does not understand the Party's policies directly violates the Party's army-building principles, and if it continues to exist and develop, it will inevitably cause greater danger. The organization of this study movement is to overcome the above-mentioned thoughts and actions that violate the Party's policies. In the study, two hours of study are guaranteed every day.

Libération wrote: \"France did not obtain the security guarantees it needed at the London Conference. France needs to change its foreign policy.\" Rome's Paese Sera wrote: \"Now, Britain and the US must bear full responsibility, and they must carefully weigh the entire situation.

The first society is in Hejian, the second is in Anguo, and the third is in Xinji. The tasks of the water conservancy promotion societies are: to systematically and uniformly purchase well-digging tools and materials, transport them to county promotion societies, and supply them to the masses for well digging; to lead, educate, and coordinate well-digging teams in various places, improve the skills and political awareness of well-digging workers, and do a good job in well-digging; and to focus on mobilizing and organizing the masses to dig wells in areas where there is no well-digging tradition.\n    　　　　Xiyang Fifth District Masses Seize the Time to Dig for Medicinal Herbs and Chop Wood on the Mountains\n    The Xiyang Fifth District United Cooperative seizes the slack farming season to organize the masses to dig for medicinal materials, chop wood on the mountains, and raise silkworms, obtaining huge profits and alleviating famine. The district suffered a poor harvest last year, and many households had nothing to eat this spring. The masses generally plan to engage in sideline production after sowing is completed to supplement their grain. According to this requirement and the local conditions, the District United Cooperative first sent people to Songjiazhuang, Xingtai, to negotiate medicinal material sales, and then organized the masses to dig for medicinal materials. From the 12th of the fourth lunar month to the end of the month, the District United Cooperative collected a total of 25,500 jin of Bupleurum, Polygala, etc., and the masses earned 3.83 million yuan (Jicha, the same below), not including sporadic sales by various villages. At the time, each dou of corn cost 3,400 yuan, which could buy 112 shi and 7 dou. Tea Village is the poorest village in the Fifth District, suffering the most severe famine, but it has successfully overcome the spring famine due to vigorous sideline production. Ninety-nine people in the village dug for medicinal materials, twenty-one people chopped mountain goods, and twenty people wove mountain goods, earning a total of 880,000 yuan. Women raised silkworms, producing forty-four mats, each of which can produce eight jin of cocoons. (Hao Bin Yuan, Qiao Fu Xi)\n    　　　　Changwan and Fangshan Launch Crash Summer Weeding Campaign\n    Changwan, Fangshan, and other counties are rushing to weed the large fields for the second time. In Fujiatai, Changwan, women, the elderly, and the weak actively participated in summer weeding during the branch-support period. Li Shuren, a woman, participated in the work assignment group and weeded her nine mu of land for the first time through work assignments. Rongjun Lu Zhi and Zhou Gui were allocated six mu of land and have already begun weeding for the third time. The first weeding has been mostly completed in fifty-nine villages in Changwan, and the second weeding has also begun. In the Longmentai sub-district of the First District of Fangshan, seven villages have a total of 7,362.1 mu of land. Local young and middle-aged people seize the time to finish the first weeding and organize themselves to dig for medicinal materials and engage in transportation and sales. When Feng Village was weeding for the first time, they were delivering grain, so they divided the work within the work assignment group, sending one or two people to drive several animals to deliver grain, while the others stayed to weed the fields. At the same time, fifteen women were recruited to participate, and as a result, the grain was delivered on time without delaying weeding.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 生产零讯\n\n1948-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　生产零讯\n  　　　　　冀中成立水利推进社\n    冀中行政公署为了发展水利，加强打井修井工作，决定成立三个水利推进社。第一社在河间，第二社在安国，第三社在辛集。水利推进社的任务是：有计划的统一购买打井用具、材料，调运给各县推进社，供给群众打井。领导教育和调剂各地打井班，提高打井工人的手艺和政治认识，好好做打井工作。在没有打井习惯的地方，有重点的动员和组织群众打井。\n    　　　　昔阳五区群众抓紧刨药砍山\n    昔阳五区联合社抓紧农事空隙，组织群众刨药材、砍山、养蚕，获得巨利，减轻灾荒。该区去年歉收，今春没吃户很多，群众一般都准备在下种完毕后搞副业生产，补充粮食。区联社根据群众这种要求与本地条件，先派人到邢台宋家庄某药栈接洽好药材销路，回去即组织群众刨药材。从阴历四月十二日到月底，区联社共收柴胡、远志等二万五千五百斤，群众赚洋三百八十三万元（冀钞，下同），各村零星出售的尚未计入。按当时每斗玉茭三千四百元，能买一百一十二石七斗。茶叶村是五区灾荒最严重的一个穷村，但因副业搞得起劲，也胜利渡过春荒。该村刨药材的九十九人，砍山货的二十一人，编作山货的二十人，总共赚洋八十八万元。妇女养蚕四十四席，每席可产八斤茧。（郝滨远、乔富喜）\n    　　　　昌宛房山突击夏锄\n    昌宛、房山等县赶锄二遍大田。昌宛傅家台在支前期，妇女老弱积极参加夏锄。妇女李淑仁参加了拨工组，九亩地靠拨工锄了头遍。荣军路之、周贵三分得了六亩地，现已开始锄三遍。昌宛五十九个村头遍大部锄完，二遍亦已开始。房山一区龙门台小区七个村，共有土地七千三百六十二亩一分，当地青壮年抓紧锄完头遍的空隙，组织起来刨药材搞运销。封村在锄头遍时正碰上运粮，他们即在拨工组内进行了分工，抽出一二人赶去几头牲口送粮，其他留下锄地。同时吸收十五个妇女参加，结果粮既按时送了，又没误了锄苗。"

    "content": "Having Established a New Attitude Towards Labor Through Land Reform\n\n　　Jingxing Women Work Hard in Production\n\n　　[This newspaper dispatch] Jingxing Chengguan women, having been emancipated through land reform, have established the idea of becoming rich through hard work and a new attitude towards labor, actively participating in various forms of production. Last winter, when weathering the famine, women were very common in transportation and sales.谷凤淑, the chairman of the women's association in Chengnai Village, often led thirty or so young women to Niangziguan to carry coal, averaging 70 jin per two people. Two people carried wooden rails, from Nanguan to Zhengshui Station, a round trip of 60 li, earning an average of 3,000 yuan per person per day (border currency, same below). They cooperated with men to transport coal to Pingshan, men driving and women pulling, six people taking turns on a cart, each time carrying a load of six to seven hundred jin. Women who could not travel far carried bricks at nearby small coal mines. The mother of Hei Gou carried 550 bricks a day, earning five and a half jin of rice. Many people actively sewed shoe soles and ran small businesses. Women in Beiguan Village sewed soles for shoe factories, forming groups freely, often sewing collectively, talking and laughing, making it easy to produce work. 李英娥 led five women to complete twenty pairs in less than four days. The chairman of the women's association - 杨玉英, a military dependent, cultivated the 1.7 mu of land she was newly allocated herself, and took time to pick wild tea, exchanged it for eggs, and took a bus to Shijiazhuang to sell. On the way back through Huolu, she bought rags and transported them to Niangziguan, making a trip every two and a half days, earning a net profit of more than 70,000 yuan. All eighty-two able-bodied women in Beiguan did not sit idle and eat. Women in Dongguan Village mostly used the windfall they were allocated as capital to run small businesses. 张凤英, 卢桃清, and 刘二迷 cooperated very well. They usually made shoes for sale, with a division of labor according to skills, some sewing the soles, some attaching the uppers, and some making paper cords and hemp ropes. Every market day, they would set up a small stall with the odds and ends collected from the three families and things people asked them to sell, with one person guarding the stall and two people going to the public-owned store to buy grain, earning 1,000 yuan per dou. 王花荣, 贾彦珍 and ten other families voluntarily pooled more than 800,000 yuan and opened a small coal shop, with three people taking turns managing it. Shares could be withdrawn and deposited at any time, with dividends distributed every half month. More people would operate the shop when business was good, and it might be closed for a few days when there was no business. All the women in Chengguan who had been allocated land participated in field labor. This year, forty-nine women in Chengnai Village have learned how to water gardens and hoe seedlings. The widow 高凤翔 has two children and was allocated two mu of land this year, and she does all the work herself, both in the fields and in the yard. Carrying water and delivering manure has become a very common activity for women. 谷凤淑 said: \"In the past, I was embarrassed to carry water, swaying from side to side. Now I am not afraid of the weight on my shoulders, and carrying such heavy coal is nothing.\" (Reporter Xing Jun)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 经过土改树立了新的劳动态度　井陉妇女努力生产\n行军\n1948-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　经过土改树立了新的劳动态度\n    井陉妇女努力生产\n    【本报讯】井陉城关妇女经过土改翻身，树立了发家致富的思想和新的劳动态度，积极参加各种生产。去冬渡荒时，妇女搞运销非常普遍，城内村妇会主席谷凤淑经常带领三十几个青年妇女，去娘子关抬煤炭，平均两人抬七十斤。运道木两人一抬，从南关送到征水车站，往返六十里，每人每天可赚三千元（边币，下同）。她们和男人合作往平山运煤，男的驾，女的拉，一辆车六个人轮流换班，每次载重六、七百斤。不能跑远道的妇女，在附近小煤窑上背砖，黑狗家娘一天背了五百五十块，挣米五斤半。许多人积极纳鞋底和跑小买卖。北关村妇女给鞋工厂纳底子，自由结成小组，经常集体纳，又说又笑，容易出活，李英娥带动五家妇女，不到四天完成了二十双。妇会主席——军属杨玉英，自己养种新分的一亩七分地，并抽暇采野茶、换成鸡蛋，乘车到石家庄去卖，回来经获鹿买破布，再运往娘子关，两天半跑一趟，净赚七万多元。北关八十二个有劳动力的妇女没有一个坐吃的。东关村的妇女，多用分得的浮财作本钱，跑腾小买卖。张凤英、卢桃清、刘二迷三家合作的很好，平时作鞋卖，按技术分工，有的纳底，有的上帮，有的打夹纸捻麻绳。每逢集日，便将三家凑的及给别人捎的零碎物品，摆个小货摊，由一人看守，两人到公营商店捣腾粮食，每斗可赚一千元。王花荣、贾彦珍等十家，自动集股八十余万，开了个小煤店，三个人轮班支应，股金随抽随入，红利半月一分，买卖多时多几个人经营，没买卖也许关几天门。全城关凡分得土地的妇女，都参加了田间劳动。城内村今年就有四十九个妇女学会了浇园锄苗；寡妇高凤翔有两个小孩，今年分了二亩地，上场下地都是自己干。担水送粪已成为妇女很平常的营生了。谷凤淑说：“过去挑个水，东摇西幌的怪羞哩，现在膀子也不怕压了，抬那么重的煤也不怎啦。”（记者行军）"

    "title": "The Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang's Rule is on the Verge of Collapse: Bureaucratic Capital from Various Areas in the Chiang-Controlled Region Flees to Hong Kong and Southern China in Large Quantities",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-05",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Comprehensive report:\n\n    Large amounts of floating capital and industrial capital from various areas in the Chiang-controlled region are increasingly fleeing to Hong Kong, Southern China, and other places. Those fleeing south are mainly bureaucratic capitalists. As the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's rule teeters on the brink of collapse, they are transferring the wealth they obtained by sucking the blood of the people, which is still in China, to Hong Kong and Southern China, which American imperialism is intensifying its control over, and gradually transferring it overseas. On the other hand, a small portion is national industrial capital that cannot withstand the oppression of the Chiang government and seeks a place to settle. The transfer activity is centered on Shanghai and Guangzhou, and the exodus extends to Changchun and Shenyang in the Northeast, Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao in North China, Nanjing and Hankou in Central China, and Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Kunming in the Northwest and Southwest, as well as other large and small cities. This southward flight of floating capital and industrial capital began on a large scale in the second half of last year and has recently reached an extremely intense level.\n\n    The trend of floating capital fleeing south is clearly reflected in the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Over the past year, the aforementioned exchange rate has increased nearly thirty-fold, about twice the rate of the Shanghai wholesale price index, which rose fifteen-fold during the same period. In the first four months of this year, the Hong Kong exchange rate has surged nearly five-fold, from 100,000 Chiang currency for HK$3.10 on January 5th to only HK$0.61 on May 4th (Beiping Pingming Daily, May 5th). Obviously, this is the result of a massive flow of funds from the Chiang-controlled region, especially Shanghai, to Hong Kong. According to an Associated Press report, in the second week of June alone, floating capital flowing into Shanghai from Beiping reached a staggering one trillion yuan per day. The Tianjin Dagong Daily also revealed on April 30th that the floating capital fleeing from various places to Guangzhou reached 500 to 600 billion yuan on April 16th and 17th alone. According to general estimates, no less than several trillion yuan flowed into Guangzhou in the first half of April. Gold and US dollars are important means of escaping for these floating capitals. Due to the inconvenience of exchange, privileged classes directly use airplanes, trains, and ships to transport large quantities of gold, foreign currencies, and cash. According to the Shanghai Economic Weekly, \"the owners of the northern floating capital that are fleeing are not ordinary people, but mainly civil and military bureaucratic capital.\" In November of last year, after the People's Liberation Army captured Shijiazhuang, a military stronghold in North China, northern floating capital \"surged south\" (Shanghai Economic Weekly). According to an Associated Press report, from the 10th to the 16th of that month, funds fleeing from the Northeast and North China to Shanghai exceeded five trillion yuan, while in the middle of that month, floating capital fleeing from Central China to Hong Kong reached 2 billion Hong Kong dollars (equivalent to approximately 29 trillion Chiang currency at the official exchange rate at that time, and more on the black market). The largest bureaucratic capitalists are transferring their assets to the Americas. The Hong Kong Free Tribune quoted Mr. Z.Y. Zau in the Canadian Forum Daily on October 1st of last year as saying: \"Whether it is Chiang Kai-shek or his ministers, they have lost confidence in their own strength and are transferring large amounts of US dollars to the Americas.\"\n\n    The southward flight of industrial equipment and capital includes dozens of light and heavy industries, such as steelmaking, machinery, hardware products, cotton textiles, woolen textiles, silk textiles, silk, shirts and socks, printing and dyeing, printing, cigarettes, carpets, woodwork, oil production, and kilns. According to incomplete statistics, since March of this year, the number of factories that have already moved or are preparing to move to Hong Kong and other places has reached 120 to 130. In April alone, the number of new factories registered with the Hong Kong Labour Department that have been approved or are under application has reached as many as 75 (Tianjin Xin Xing Daily, May 24th). According to Pingming Daily in early May, citing materials from Hong Kong economic publications, the industrial capital that has recently moved from the Chiang-controlled region to Hong Kong has reached approximately HK$50 million (approximately US$10 million). The textile industry, which has the most impact on people's livelihoods, accounts for the majority of industries fleeing to Hong Kong. According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily at the end of April, in Shanghai alone, more than ten yarn factories have already been opened or are preparing to be opened in Hong Kong, with a total of approximately 200,000 spindles. Among them, the capital of six yarn factories, including Nanguo, Peninsula, and Nanhai, amounts to HK$108 million. Among the total number of spindles in these more than ten yarn factories, based on existing materials, more than half are owned by the Song Ziwen Zhongfang Company and its affiliated Shenxin Yarn Factory. Among them, the Hong Kong, Kowloon, Weilen, and Nanyang factories have either partially started operations or are about to start operations. Pingming Daily revealed in early May that \"most of these factories moving to Hong Kong have capital backgrounds of wealthy families.\" The Tianjin Dagong Daily also stated on June 2nd that \"most of the southward transferred funds (referring to industrial funds) are special elements.\" The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government is colluding with American imperialism, preparing to move important industries in the Northeast and North China to South China, distributed in the so-called \"Xijiang Industrial Zone\" (Guangdong), \"Zhuzhou Industrial Zone\" (Central Hunan), \"Ma'anshan Industrial Zone\" (western suburbs of Nanjing), and Taiwan. According to the Qingdao Junmin Daily at the end of March, in Qingdao alone, there are 40 to 50 factories to be moved to Taiwan. The Tangshan Steel Plant received a secret order from the authorities last month to dismantle the machines, pack them into boxes, and transport them to Daye, southeast of Wuhan. According to reports from foreign news agencies such as Associated Press and Reuters, Ong Wenhao, the newly appointed Executive Yuan President of the Chiang regime, publicly announced at a Legislative Yuan meeting on June 7th that \"the government plans to move important factories in North China to South China and Central China, south of the Yangtze River.\"\n\n    In addition, some of the national industrial and commercial capital were forced to flee to Hong Kong. The Tianjin Renli Woolen Textile Company was forced to relocate its machines purchased from abroad to Hong Kong to set up a factory due to the Chiang bandit's control over imports and exports. An import and export merchant who moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong said: \"We came with tears in our eyes.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋家匪帮统治濒于崩溃　蒋区各地官僚资本大量逃向香港华南\n\n1948-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋家匪帮统治濒于崩溃\n    蒋区各地官僚资本大量逃向香港华南\n    【新华社陕北三日电】综合报导：\n    蒋区各地大量游资及工业资本正日益猛烈地逃向香港、华南等地。南逃者主要为官僚资本，蒋介石匪帮在其统治濒于崩溃之际，正在将其吮吸人民膏血得来的、还留在中国的财富，转移到香港与美帝国主义正在加紧进行控制的华南，并逐步转移到海外去。另一方面，也有一小部分是不堪蒋政府压迫而企图寻求栖身之所的民族工业资本。转移活动以上海、广州两地为中心，逃风遍及东北的长春、沈阳，华北的北平、天津、青岛，华中的南京、汉口，西北的西安、兰州，西南的成都、重庆、昆明等各大小城市。这种游资和工业资本的南逃，系自去年下半年大规模开始，最近已达于极猛烈程度。\n    游资南逃的趋势，显明地表现在香港对上海的汇兑关系上，去年一年中，上述汇率上涨约近卅倍，比同期内，上海批发物价指数上涨十五倍的速度约大一倍；今年头四个月中，港汇已从一月五日的蒋币十万元换港币三元一角涨到五月四日的仅换六角一分，即猛涨几达五倍（北平平明日报五月五日电）。显然这是由于蒋区特别是上海巨大资金流向香港的结果。据合众社消息，六月份第二周内，仅由北平一地涌入上海的游资每日达一万亿元之巨。天津大公报亦于四月卅日披露：仅四月十六、十七两日各地逃往广州游资即达五、六千亿元。据一般估计，四月上半月流入广州的资金不下数万亿元。黄金、美钞是这些游资逃避的重要手段。大批黄金、外币与现钞因不便汇兑，特权阶级便直接利用飞机、火车和轮船逃运。据沪经济周报披露：南逃的“北方游资的所有者不是普通人士，主要是文武官僚资本。”去年十一月间，人民解放军攻克华北军事重镇石家庄后，北方游资即“汹涌南下”（沪经济周报）。据美联社报导：该月十日至十六日，东北、华北逃往上海资金已超过五万亿元，而该月中旬，华中逃港游资则已达廿亿港币（即依当时官价汇率约合蒋币廿九万余亿元，黑市当不止此）。最大的官僚资本，则纷纷转至美洲。香港自由丛刊于去年十月一日引加拿大论坛日报载文幼章氏谈称：“无论是蒋介石也好，蒋的部长们也好，都已对自己的力量失去信心，正在把大批美金移藏到美洲。”\n    工业设备及资金的南逃，则包括炼钢、机器、五金制品、棉纺织、毛织、丝织、丝绸、衫袜、印染、印刷、卷烟、地毯、木器、制油、窑等轻重工业数十业。据不完全统计，今年三月以来，已经或正在准备迁往香港等地的工厂已达一百二、三十家，仅四月份一月内向香港劳工处注册的新工厂经获准及正申请中者即达七十五家之多（天津新星报五月二十四日）。又据平明日报五月初引香港经济刊物材料，最近由蒋区移往香港，已经到达的工业资金约达五千万港币（约折合美金一千万元）。逃港工业以与民生最有影响的纺织业占多数。据天津大公报四月底披露，仅上海一地已经或正在准备在港开设的纱厂已在十家以上，共有纱锭约达二十万枚左右。其中南国、半岛、南海等六家纱厂资本额即达一亿另八百万港币。此十家以上纱厂的纱锭总数中，仅据现有材料可说明其背景者，即有一半以上为宋子文中纺公司及与其有关的申新纱厂所有，其中香港、九龙、纬伦、南洋等厂则或已部分开工，或即将开工。平明日报五月初曾透露，迁港的“这些工厂大部以豪门资本为背景”。天津大公报六月二日亦称：“南调资金（指工业资金）以特殊分子居多”。蒋介石卖国政府正与美帝国主义勾结，准备把东北、华北的重要工业迁往华南，分布在所谓“西江工业区”（广东）、“株州工业区”（湘中）、“马鞍山工业区”（南京西郊）及台湾等地。据三月底青岛军民日报载：仅青岛一地，即有四、五十个工厂要迁往台湾。唐山炼钢厂已于上月接到当局密令拆卸机器装箱运往武汉东南之大冶。另据美联、路透等外国通讯社报导：蒋记新任行政院长翁文＠且于六月七日立法院会议上公开宣布“政府计划将华北的重要工厂迁移至长江以南的华南及华中”。\n    此外，被迫逃港的有一部分是民族工商业资本。天津仁立毛织公司即因蒋匪统制进出口，而被迫把购自国外的机器改运香港设厂。一位从上海迁港的进出口商人说：“我们是带着泪来的”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd: Qingdao News: Qingdao has now become a complete American colony. Most of the city is under the direct control of the US military: the Dagang Wharf in the west is entirely under US military control, guarded by US soldiers; the south bank of the Zhanqiao Pier and Tuandao Island are US military garrison areas, with US military arsenals and airports on Tuandao Island; in the east, several important mountains east of the original site of Shandong University (such as the entire Qingdao Mountain and Zhanshan Mountain) are completely off-limits to Chinese people; the Taitung Dengzhou Road area to the north is a US military semi-controlled area, and citizens must have US military passes to travel there; the Cangku Airport is controlled by the US Air Force; several large buildings in the city, such as the former Japanese naval club on Taiping Road, the Donghai Hotel on Nanhai Road, and the original site of Shandong University, are all occupied by the US military. Currently, only the Baisha River water source in the north of the city is not yet under US military control, but the US military has notified Chiang Kai-shek's side that if the situation becomes \"urgent,\" the US military will send sailors to defend it. The US military has stationed in Qingdao the Naval Base Command, Marine Corps, Marine Corps Military Police, Naval Patrol Team, and other eleven military units, as well as the Intelligence Office directly under the US Military Operations Department, the Intelligence Office of the Pacific Fleet, and the Intelligence Group of the Port Transportation Office, and eight intelligence agencies in total, in addition to the US Consulate, the American YMCA, and the US Military Officers' Club. US troops stationed in Qingdao frequently conduct live ammunition exercises in the city, wantonly abuse and kill Chinese residents, arbitrarily inspect Chinese shops and residences, rape Chinese women, force barmaids to submit photos to the US military, run over people with cars at will, shoot and kill people for no reason, arrest Chinese people and torture them with electricity for fun, and even detain Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers for forced labor, committing all kinds of evil. According to Chiang Kai-shek's official statistics, in the past year alone, there have been more than 260 incidents of atrocities committed by US troops stationed in Qingdao, resulting in more than 400 casualties among citizens. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities in Qingdao have adopted a policy of covering up US military atrocities and have allowed the US military to handle incidents caused by the US military unilaterally. However, the people of Qingdao are increasingly launching strong resistance to US military atrocities. After rickshaw puller Lian Mingcheng was stabbed to death by a US soldier on March 31 last year, rickshaw pullers went on strike for a day, and students from Shandong University also held a rally in support, demanding that the US military withdraw from China immediately. On April 1 this year, two US soldiers beat a small stallholder with sticks, arousing the anger of the stallholders, who rose up in resistance, resulting in a three-hour melee, resulting in minor casualties on the US side. On the same day, a US soldier shot and wounded a bar accountant for no reason, and all the staff in the counter came out and beat the US soldier severely. According to the Qingdao Military and Civilian Daily on June 9, on June 3 and 4, the US fleet conducted a landing exercise on the Shazikou sea off Qingdao, and the fishing grounds and fishing gear of the local villages were mostly destroyed, causing heavy losses to the fishermen. On May 25, five fishermen, including Xu Qianyi, were fishing in Qianwan (one and a half nautical miles east of Tuandao Island) when their boat was overturned by a US landing craft No. 12, injuring one person and causing losses of 850 million Chiang Kai-shek currency in materials. The fishermen were angry and negotiated with the US Military Police Command, but the US side ignored them.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, via TASS, Shanghai, 16th of last month, quoting news from the Kuomintang CC-affiliated newspaper Shen Bao, reported that American imperialism is preparing to occupy Qingdao indefinitely. The term of the \"lease contract\" for the houses used by the US military in Qingdao has been extended to July 1, 1950. The US military authorities stationed in Qingdao have purchased the Donghai Hotel for 700,000 US dollars and are still purchasing two other large houses to serve as dormitories for US military officers and their families. Not long ago, the American magazine \"World Report\" published an article revealing that the number of US troops stationed in Qingdao was 2,700 ground troops and 3,300 naval personnel. Truman signed a legislative bill on March 8, approving the indefinite extension of the term of stationing of US troops in Asia, China, and other places.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋贼媚美卖国政策下青岛成了美帝殖民地\n\n1948-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋贼媚美卖国政策下青岛成了美帝殖民地\n    【新华社山东三日电】青岛消息：青岛现已变成十足的美国殖民地。该市全市大部地区为美军直接控制：西边的大港码头全由美军管制，由美军站岗警戒；南岸栈桥和团岛为美军驻防区，团岛并设有美军火库和飞机场；东边从山东大学原址往东几个重要山地（如整个青岛山、湛山），根本不准中国人接近；往北台东登镇州路一带，为美军半控制区，市民来往该处，须持有美军通行证；沧口飞机场为美空军控制；市内几个大建筑物如太平路原日本人建筑的海军俱乐部、南海路的东海饭店及山东大学原处，皆为美军占据。目前仅市北白沙河水源地尚未为美军控制，但美军已向蒋方通知：情况一“紧急”，美军即派水兵防守。美军在青岛驻有海军基地司令部、海军陆战队、海军陆战宪兵队、海军巡逻队等十一军事单位，和美军作战部直属情报处、西太平洋舰队所属情报处、港口运输处情报组等八个情报机关，此外尚有美领事馆、美国青年会、美军官俱乐部等。驻青美军经常在市内举行实弹演习，恣意虐杀中国居民，任意检查中国商号、住宅，强奸中国妇女，强迫酒吧间女招待向美军呈缴照片，汽车随便撞死人，无故开枪打死人，将中国人捕去施以电刑取乐，甚至扣押蒋军士兵作苦工，无恶不作。据蒋官方统计，仅去年一年间，驻青美军暴行事件即达二百六十多件，伤亡市民四百多人。青市蒋当局对美军暴行皆采包庇态度，并允美军肇事由美方单方处理。但青市人民对美军暴行则日益掀起强烈反抗，去年三月卅一日人力车夫廉明诚被美军刺伤致死后，人力车夫曾全体罢工一天，山东大学学生亦举行集会声援，要求美军迅速退出中国去。今年四月一日，二美兵棒打小摊贩，激起摊贩众怒。群起反抗。造成三小时之混战，结果美方略有死伤。同日一美兵无故开枪打伤酒吧间帐房，柜内伙计全体出动，将该美兵痛打一顿。另据六月九日青岛军民日报透露：六月三、四两日，美舰队在青岛沙子口海面举行登陆演习，当地适村渔场，渔具、网绳多被毁坏，渔民损失惨重。五月二十五日有徐谦益等渔民五人，驾船捕鱼，在前湾（在团岛东一海里半）遭美十二号登陆艇一艘撞翻，一人受伤，物资损失达蒋币八万万五千万元，渔民愤激，向美宪兵司令部交涉，美方竟置之不理。\n    【新华社陕北电】据塔斯社上海上月十六日电引国民党ＣＣ系报纸申报的消息透露，美帝国主义是准备无限期地盘踞在青岛了。美军在青所用房屋的“租赁合同”的期限已延至一九五○年七月一日。驻青美国军事当局已以七十万美元购得东海大旅馆，且还在购买其他两幢大房子，作为美国军官和家属的宿舍。不久前美杂志“世界报导”曾载文披露美在青驻军数目为地面部队二千七百名，海军三千三百名。杜鲁门曾于三月八日签署一项立法案，核准将驻在亚洲、中国等地的美军驻扎期限无限期延长。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. Under the call of the Northwest Field Army Frontline Headquarters and Political Department, the Northwest Liberation Army units have enthusiastically launched a disaster relief campaign to conserve two liang of wheat per person per day. The movement is tentatively scheduled for one month. The conserved grain will be transported to the disaster area as quickly as possible. The political department of a certain unit said in its instructions on conserving and providing disaster relief: Our past victories have relied on the active support of the border area people; and the future will remain the same. \"The border area is our home, and the hunger and famine of the border area people is our hunger and famine.\" In addition to responding to the call, some troops have also taken the time to cultivate wasteland and plant vegetables in order to conserve more grain for disaster relief.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 1st. The people of Jiaocheng, Wenshui, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Qingyuan, Yangqu, Linxian, Lishi, Zhongyang and other counties enthusiastically support the Jinzhong Frontline Liberation War. As soon as the mobilization orders for participation in the war were issued in various counties, the militia and the masses responded enthusiastically. In Baijiashan Village, Fourth District, Lishi, the original plan was for only 30 people to participate in the war, but before the official notice was even issued, more than 80 people had already signed up. When Yan Shouen, a 50-year-old poor peasant in the village, learned of the news, his son had gone to a relative's house. Fearing that his son would be late in returning home and would not be able to participate, he instructed his wife to prepare clothes earlier and personally ran to find his son to sign him up. Liu Rongkui from Xiaduanduan Village was ginning cotton in Liulin when he heard the news about participating in the war. He ran 50 li overnight to return home to sign up; but his younger brother, Liu Yaokui, had already signed up first. The two then argued over who would go, and unable to resolve the matter, they both went in the end. Women and children in various places also actively participated in supporting the frontline work. Women in Yanjia Mountain and other villages in Linxian voluntarily made bullet bags, grenade bags, and rice bags for the militia participating in the war. As the militia did not have gun oil, the women in the village ground up the apricot kernels they had accumulated over the years, boiled them into oil, and sent them to the militia participating in the war. Women in Xiaoyi made a large number of military shoes to comfort the troops, and many women voluntarily went to the hospital to care for the wounded. Children in Yezihe, Jiaocheng, and other places collectively went up the mountains to collect firewood for the troops to burn. The militia and laborers participating in the war were very welcome by the masses along the way. For example, when the militia participating in the war from the Fourth District of Lishi passed through Xishuba Village, dozens of nearby villages jointly offered comfort. The Women's Committee and the Mao Zedong Youth League of Dawu Village donated eggs and cigarettes to comfort the militia participating in the war, and wrote a warm letter of condolence, which said: \"We personally made many flowers and sent them to you to wear, so that everyone knows the glory of your participation in the war. We hope that when you brothers arrive at the front, you will support the troops, win more victories, and liberate our fathers, brothers, sisters, and elders in the Jinzhong Plain as soon as possible. We must produce well to support the frontline; and we guarantee that your families will not feel any difficulties.\" Note: When the people of all regions are enthusiastically supporting the frontline, the frontline troops and the rear mobilization and service organs must use civilian labor very sparingly. Mobilization should be limited, and surplus laborers and coolies should be returned. Only by constantly paying attention to saving civilian labor can we maintain a high degree of popular enthusiasm for participation in the war. Otherwise, this enthusiasm will decline one day.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北我军节约救灾晋绥人民热烈支前\n\n1948-07-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北我军节约救灾晋绥人民热烈支前\n    【新华社西北二日电】在西北野战军前线司令部、政治部号召下，西北解放军各部已热烈展开每人每日节约麦子二两的救灾运动。该运动暂定期为一个月。节约之粮食将以最快方法运到灾区。某部政治部在节约救灾的指示中说：我军过去的胜利，是依靠边区人民的积极支援；今后也仍然如此。“边区是我们的家，边区人民的饥饿灾荒，就是我们的饥饿灾荒。”有些部队除响应号召外，并抽空开荒种菜，以便能更多节约粮食救灾。\n    【新华社晋绥一日电】交城、文水、汾阳、孝义、清源、阳曲、临县、离石、中阳等县人民热烈支援晋中前线解放战争。各县参战动员令刚一发出，民兵、群众即纷纷热烈响应。离石四区白家山村，原只计划三十人参战，但正式通知还未发出，报名参战者已达八十余人。该村五十多岁的贫农严守恩知道参战消息时，他的儿子正到亲戚家去了，他怕儿子回家迟了，轮不上参加，即一面吩咐婆姨早些准备衣裳，一面亲自跑去找儿回家报名。下段段村的刘荣奎正在柳林弹棉花，听到参战消息，连夜跑了五十里路赶回家报名；但他弟弟刘耀奎已先报了名，于是两人争着要去，不得解决，最后是两人都去了。各地妇女儿童也积极参加支援前线的工作。临县阎家山等村妇女，自动为参战民兵赶制子弹袋、手榴弹袋、米袋。民兵没有擦枪油，该村妇女即将历年积蓄下的杏仁子，磨碎熬成油，送给参战民兵。孝义妇女做好大批军鞋慰劳军队，许多妇女自动到医院看护伤员；交城野子河等地儿童则集体上山打柴，供部队烧用。参战民兵民工甚受沿途群众欢迎，如离石四区参战民兵，路经西属巴村时，附近数十村庄联合慰劳。大武村的妇女委员会及毛泽东青年团，捐出鸡蛋、纸烟慰劳参战民兵，并写了一封热烈的慰问信，信中说：“我们亲手做了许多花，送你们戴上，让人人都知道你们参战的光荣。希望兄弟们到了前方，支援部队，多打胜仗，早日解放咱们晋中平川的父老兄弟姐妹们。我们一定要好好生产，支援前线；并保证你们家中不会感到困难”。按：当各地人民踊跃地支援前线的时候，前方部队及后方动员机关与勤务机关，必须十分节省地使用民力。动员应有限度，超出需要的民工民夫应该退回。只有经常注意节省民力，才能经常保持人民参战的高度积极性。否则，这积极性就会有低落的一天。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-05",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The Party Rectification Movement in Xueta Village\n　　Xueta is a market town in the sixth district of Weixian County, Jinnan, with 430 households, 1,450 people, and 6,982 mu of land, equivalent to 8,607 mu of standard land. Our work began here in 1938, but it was devastated by the recalcitrant army of Shi Yousan. The enemy and puppets then occupied it as a stronghold for four years. After liberation in 1945, three major movements were carried out: anti-traitor liquidation, hiring tenants and poverty alleviation, and filling in gaps and making up deficiencies, resulting in the calculation of more than seven qing of land. The hired and poor peasants now cultivate more than three mu of land each, but the quality is poor. More than half of the landlords and rich peasants are families of soldiers and workers. The fruits of several movements were unfairly distributed. A large amount of windfall wealth and houses from last year's filling-in movement have not yet been distributed. In addition, some party members and cadres embezzled, wasted, stole, over-occupied, and sold things, and their work style was undemocratic. Therefore, it cannot be said that the masses have been completely turned over politically and economically.\n　　After the work team arrived in the village, it held separate branch meetings and mass meetings, stating its attitude and explaining the spirit of the land reform and party rectification policy. Initially, a preliminary understanding of the overall situation of the village was made from party members, cadres, and visits to the poor and hired laborers. It was found that the masses had concerns about the cadres, and a few cadres with major mistakes were secretly sabotaging the work. Then, two mass meetings were held, with the participation of party members and cadres. The policy of party rectification and supplementation was explained again, and the activities of individual cadres that had been understood were openly criticized in public. The list of party members was made public, and party members and cadres were called upon to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and to accept mass review. The spirit of party rectification was explained. On the other hand, the masses were called upon to rise up, express their opinions, help with party rectification, and conduct ideological struggle with erring party members by reasoning and clarifying the facts. After the meeting, a few party members with major mistakes began to lower their heads, and the morale of the masses also increased, saying, \"This time, the cadres are not like before.\" However, the ideological concerns of the masses were still not completely broken, such as fearing that \"it will be all thunder and no rain,\" and complaining that our investigation took too long, demanding quicker action. Based on the degree of ideological preparation of party members and the demands of the masses, it was decided to immediately begin party rectification and combine it with mobilizing the poor and hired laborers to promote each other's development.\n　　Thirty-seven new and old cadres and party members from the entire village participated in the party and cadre rectification, including nine party members. 70 percent were from poor peasant, new middle peasant, and worker backgrounds; none were landlords or rich peasants. Many cadres were newly promoted after joining the army last fall, and these people had few problems. At the beginning of the party rectification, it was clearly proposed that after the branch rectification, cadres would not be dismissed and militiamen would not hand over their guns. It was also publicly announced that there would be no beatings or deductions, and that democratic reasoning would be used.\n　　At the beginning of the party rectification, in addition to verbal appeals, blackboard newspapers were also issued, welcoming the masses to participate in branch meetings, speak freely, and leave the meeting freely. The next day when the branch held a meeting, many people came to participate automatically. As criticism and self-criticism unfolded, the masses became more and more interested in participating. Sometimes, before the party rectification meeting even started, some poor and hired laborers would be waiting there early. Branch party members conscientiously reviewed and carried out criticism and self-criticism. This quickly spread throughout the village, and the number of participants increased, from one or two dozen at the beginning to sixty or seventy. Some were mobilized by our work team, some raised opinions and questions face-to-face at the meeting, and some reflected after listening, returned to the poor peasant group to convey and deliberate, and raised new opinions, which they then raised at the branch meeting the next day. This helped and promoted the reflection of party members and cadres, and at the same time broke the concerns of the masses about party members and cadres, and boosted their morale. For example, Zhai Huaifang, after seeing party members reflect and admit their mistakes, said, \"They returned the house I wanted, and even if the house can't be returned, I feel happy in my heart that they admitted their mistakes at the meeting this time.\"\n　　This kind of branch meeting with mass participation gave party members a lot of enlightenment and education in examining themselves. It also made them truly understand the spirit of the party rectification of curing diseases and saving people, and the policy of distinguishing right from wrong and treating people differently. They realized that as long as they corrected their mistakes, they would have a bright future. Through these many issues, the awareness of party members and cadres was further improved. In the process, for their respective mistakes, the method of self-deliberation and democratic discussion was adopted, and reasoning struggle was carried out, developing criticism and self-criticism. In the deliberation, the cadres gradually differentiated, and a few with major mistakes began to be isolated, and the criticism struggle between cadres and cadres, and between the masses and cadres, was fiercely unfolded. At this time, the leadership advocated full reasoning, allowing the person being criticized to make a statement at any time. Even if an error has already been admitted, it can be re-submitted to be overturned if the person believes it is unjust. Some party members and cadres had true evidence of their mistakes, but they also tried to quibble or overturn the case, which only further exposed their mistakes. Secondly, after the masses rose up, they sometimes had some extreme retaliatory opinions about a small number of party members and cadres with more mistakes, making light matters heavy and exaggerating the mistakes of cadres and party members. The leadership paid attention to these opinions in a timely manner, pointing out that party rectification is to neither relax mistakes nor wrong good people, so that the movement can get on the right track. Third, when some party members and cadres reflected to a certain extent, but their thinking had not been further cleared, it was necessary to appropriately wait for their ideological consciousness, and not continue to pursue it. Temporarily put it aside for individual talks and investigate evidence, so that he could have room for ideological change. Fourth, party members or cadres who performed well were appropriately praised at any time, and individual talks or small-scale discussions were held with some activists after the meeting to improve their understanding and encourage them to play a backbone role at the meeting. These people were mostly party members or cadres with minor mistakes, and they played a large role in the party rectification.\n　　When party members and cadres reflected to a certain extent, the leadership had to raise many issues in this section to the height of ideology, conduct an education, and ask everyone to discuss and distinguish the nature, size, severity of the errors, and how to treat them differently. After self-reporting and public discussion, cadres and party members were divided into three categories: the first category included Zhai Chengyin and others, totaling twenty-one people, who had minor or no errors. The second category included nine people, who had some errors but not serious. The third category included seven people, who had more serious errors. There were also very fierce arguments during the self-reporting and public discussion. For example, Zhai Fuyin reported himself as the second category, and everyone said, \"You used to be a party member and village chief. You bit out many Communist Party members in front of the enemy. This is not just a mistake, it is a crime. You should be in the third category.\" Liu Xitong reported himself as the third category, and everyone said, \"You are responsible for safekeeping, so you are responsible for the fruits, but in fact you are not in charge, so you should be in the second category.\"\n　　The reflection of the first category of party members and cadres was repeatedly deliberated at the branch meeting and then assisted by the poor peasant congress in the poor peasant group. The reflection was better, and it was quickly passed in the branch and among the masses. Some immediately joined the poor peasant league.\n　　In the first stage of party rectification, while mobilizing the masses to participate, attention was also paid to discovering and cultivating some loyal, reliable, and capable poor and hired laborers, and they were used as the backbone to carry out chain connections, with people introducing and reviewing each other from street to street. The conditions for joining the league were agreed upon, from narrow to wide, and batches of people were absorbed into the league. After participating in the party rectification, they learned about many problems and further improved their confidence. At this time, it was the time when the old and new crops were not yet connected, and the masses urgently demanded a solution to the difficulty of eating and burning. At the same time, the poor peasant groups continued to expand, and some new middle peasants were also absorbed, with twelve male groups of one hundred and ten people and nine female groups of fifty people. Then, an education on uniting the middle peasants was carried out. The poor peasant congress elected ten representatives, and the middle and poor peasant congress elected five middle peasant representatives to jointly form a temporary agricultural representative conference to lead the masses in drawing grain from landlords and old rich peasants with large amounts of grain storage, taking out the existing fruit money from the old peasant associations, and calculating the rent from the two public-owned stores. These grains and money were quickly distributed to solve the urgent difficulties of the masses in eating and burning.\n　　The difficulties of eating and burning have been solved, the masses have a relatively sound organization, and they have been tempered by a struggle. The masses have been mobilized, and then the second and third categories of party members and cadres will be discussed, and the party rectification will enter the second stage. The leadership carried out education on reasoning struggle, and the masses said, \"Reasoning excludes gentlemen, and the law governs villains. Reasoning is a good method.\" Everyone was dissatisfied with the bad habit of beating people at the meeting in the past. At this time, a branch meeting was held (non-party cadres also participated). This branch meeting was fully prepared, and preliminary conclusions had been reached on party members and cadres. Mass representatives were invited to participate, and more than 20 temporary groups of middle and poor peasants were organized to sit around the branch in an organized and orderly manner. The meeting was presided over by the branch and the work team, and the cadres and the masses were mobilized again, explaining the purpose of inviting the masses to participate in the party rectification. Then, the party members spoke in turn. When it was mentioned that some mistakes should be the responsibility of the higher authorities, the work team immediately interrupted to explain, and fully assumed the responsibility that should be borne by the higher authorities. When it came to errors such as surrender and corruption, they immediately interjected to explain that our party's policy on dealing with errors such as corruption and surrender is to adhere to the principles of the party, distinguish between the severity of the errors, and deal with them accordingly. After a party member made a statement, the cadres, party members, and the masses immediately turned the meeting into a group meeting to deliberate and discuss, make suggestions to the speaker, and the speaker also reflected or defended according to the opinions of the masses, explaining any discrepancies with the facts, and asking others to testify. When it was considered that there were no more opinions, the general meeting became various group meetings again to discuss the handling of various errors. After deliberation, each group reported on the spot, and finally, based on the reports from inside and outside the party, the nature of the various errors was distinguished. According to the party constitution, the party members, branch members, and masses were re-educated, and conclusions were made on the spot through punishment. Those who were good were praised, and those who could not be concluded continued to deliberate.\n　　In this way, the party's internal solution and the masses' solution were combined, so that party members and cadres quickly put down their burdens and immediately felt happy. They quickly showed a positive role in the branch and among the masses. In the process of reflection, the leadership seized the opportunity to educate the masses on the spot, let the masses discuss the handling, punishment and other issues on the spot, and it was easy to understand and grasp the nature of the errors and the principles of punishment. In form, it was a branch meeting and also a middle and poor peasant meeting. The meeting was combined with group meetings at any time, which was lively, flexible, simple and labor-saving. Secondly, at such a meeting, party members were educated and the masses were educated, so that party education and non-party education were combined, and education and practical problem-solving were combined. Some party members returned the embezzled or over-occupied fruits to the masses on the spot, which greatly improved the party's prestige. Thirdly, the method of combining the general meeting with group deliberation allowed everyone to have ample opportunity to speak, and individual radical opinions could be corrected in time during deliberation. Party members could also defend inappropriate opinions at any time. The meeting was filled with the atmosphere of curing diseases and saving people and democratic reasoning.\n　　When the branch had been completely reorganized, the number of male and female poor peasant league members had grown to more than 230. At this time, the poor peasant league was formally established, and 19 members were elected to form a committee. Four party members who participated in the poor peasant league, three were elected as chairman and members, and the two people with the most votes were party members. Four other cadres were also elected as members. The reorganization of the party's ranks and the reorganization of the mass ranks, in the steps of appropriate cooperation, so that better party members and cadres can immediately play an active role in the mass ranks. This not only smoothly, but also quickly reorganized the party's ranks, and also reorganized the mass ranks, so that the party's prestige among the masses and the masses' understanding of the party were greatly improved.\n　　The democratic party rectification in Xueta officially lasted for about a month, and the next step is to prepare to classify classes and establish a new peasant association.\n\n　　Editor's note: The party rectification movement in Xueta Village was carried out by a work team of the Central Bureau. Its experience is generally successful. However, making conclusions, deciding on punishments and praises on the spot based on the opinions of inside and outside the party may cause problems if there is not sufficient preparation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 雪塔村的整党运动\n\n1948-07-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　雪塔村的整党运动\n    雪塔是冀南威县六区的一个集镇，有四三○户，一四五○口人，土地六九八二亩，折合标准地八六○七亩。一九三八年开始有我们的工作，后受石友三顽军摧残，敌伪又在这里按据点四年。四五年解放后进行过反奸清算、雇佃贫及填平补齐三大运动，共算出土地七顷多。雇贫农现耕地均在三亩以上，但质量差。地主富农半数以上是军工属。几次运动中果实分配不公，去年填补运动的大批浮财及房屋尚未分配，加以部分党员干部从中贪污浪费、偷窃、多占、变卖以及作风不民主等，因之群众在政治上经济上都不能说已经彻底翻透身。\n    工作组到村后分别召开支部会议及群众大会，表明态度，说明土改整党政策的精神。开始从党员干部及访问贫雇中对全村面貌作了初步了解，发现群众对干部有顾虑，个别错误较大的干部暗中破坏。接着召开二次群众大会，党员干部也参加，再次讲明整党抽补方针，并将了解的个别干部活动情况，当众作了公开的批评，公开党员名单，号召党员干部进行批评与自我批评，好好接受群众审查，说明整党精神。另一方面号召群众起来发表意见帮助整党，向犯错误的党员进行说理明事的思想斗争。会后，少数错误较大的党员开始低头，群众情绪也提高，说：“这一回干部可不象以前了。”但群众思想顾虑仍未完全打破，如怕“干打雷不下雨”，又嫌我们调查时间长，要求快些行动。根据党员思想准备的程度及群众要求决定立即开始整党，并与发动贫雇结合进行，使之互相推动发展。\n    全村参加整党整干的新老干部和党员三十七人，内有党员九人，成份有百分之七十是贫农、新中农、工人，没一个地主富农。不少干部都是去秋参军后新提拔的，这些人问题不大。整党开始明确提出经过支部整党：干部不赎职，民兵不缴枪，并公开宣传不打不扣，民主讲理。\n    整党开始，除口头号召外，还出了黑板报，欢迎群众参加支部会议，自由发言，并可以自由退会。支部第二天开会时，不少群众自动来参加，随着批评与自我批评的开展，群众参加越来越有兴趣，有时整党会还没开，有些贫雇很早就在那里等着。支部党员认真检讨进行批评和自我批评。这样就很快传开了全村，参加的群众也越来越多了，由开始的一二十人到六七十人。有些是我们工作组动员去的，有的在会上当面提出意见与质问，有的听了反省，回到贫农小组传达酝酿提出新的意见，第二天又到支部会上提出。这样帮助和促进了党员干部的反省，同时也打破了群众对党员干部的顾虑，鼓舞了他们的情绪，如翟怀芳见到党员反省认错后，说：“俺要的房子他们倒回去，这次能在会上认了错，就是房子退不了心里也痛快。”\n    这种群众参加的支部大会，给党员检讨自己以不少的启发教育，同时也使他们真正了解整党的治病救人的精神和分辨是非分别对待的方针。认识到只要改正错误就有光明前途的。通过这许多问题，进一步提高党员干部的觉悟程度。进行中对他们各人的错误，采取了由他们自己酝酿，民主讨论。说理斗争的办法，开展批评与自我批评。在酝酿中干部间逐渐分化，少数错误较大的开始孤立，干部与干部间，群众与干部间的批评斗争就激烈展开。这时领导上提倡充分说理，允许被批评的本人随时进行申辩，即使是已承认了的错误，如本人认为有冤枉时，还可重新提出推翻。有些党员干部错误有真凭实证，也企图狡辩或翻案，结果反更加暴露了自己错误。其次，当群众起来后，对少数错误较多的党员干部，有时会有些偏激报复的意见，以轻为重，夸大干部和党员的错误，领导上对这些意见及时加以注意说明，指出整党是既不放松错误也不冤枉好人，使运动走入正轨。第三、有些党员干部反省到一定程度，他本人思想还没进一步打通时，要适当等待他的思想自觉，不要一直追下去，暂搁一下进行个别谈话，调查证据，这样能使他思想有转变的余地。第四、对表现好的党员或干部，随时适当表扬，会后对有些积极分子进行个别谈话或小型座谈，提高他们的认识，鼓励他们在会上起骨干带头作用。这些人大部是错误较小的党员或干部，他们在整党中起了很大作用。\n    党员干部反省到一定程度，领导上要把这一段的许多问题，提到思想的高度，作一次教育，并要大家讨论，分别错误性质、大小、轻重，及如何进行不同对待，经过自报公议，干部党员分成了三类：计第一类有翟成印等二十一人，错误不大或没什么错误。第二类九人，有些错误但不严重。第三类七人，错误较严重。在自报公议分类时也有很激烈的争论，如翟福印自报是第二类，大家说：“从前你是党员，当过村长，你在敌人面前咬了好些共产党员，这不仅是错误简置是犯罪。应放第三类。”刘西同自报第三类，大家说：“你负责保管，对果实你是有责任的，不过实际你不当家，你在第二类吧。”\n    第一类党员干部的反省，在支部会上反复酝酿再经过贫农团小组中贫农大会给以帮助，反省较好，在支部内在群众中都很快被通过了，有些并立即参加了贫农团。\n    在这第一阶段整党中，一方面发动群众参加，同时也注意发现培养了一些忠实可靠有能力的贫雇农，由他们作骨干进行串连，人与人街与街，互相介绍审查，议定发展入团条件，由窄到宽，一批一批的吸收进团。他们经过参加整党了解到许多问题，更提高了信心。这时正是青黄不接之时，群众迫切要求解决吃烧困难，同时贫农组也不断扩大，有些新中农也吸收进来，已有男组十二个一百一十人，女组九个五十人。接着进行了团结中农的教育，由贫农大会选出十个代表，中贫农大会上选了五个中农代表，共同组成临时的农代会，领导群众向有大量存粮的地主旧富农进行抽粮，向旧农会拿出现存的果实款，又向两家公营商店算了房租，这些粮款很快分配下去，解决了群众吃烧的迫切困难。\n    解决了吃烧困难，群众已有了较健全的组织，且又经过了一次斗争锻炼，群众已发动了起来，接着讨论二三类党员干部，整党即进入第二阶段。领导上进行了说理斗争的教育，群众说“说理排君子，王法治小人，说理是好办法。”大家对过去一开会就打人的坏作风都不满。这时就召开支部大会（非党干部也参加），这次支部大会是经过充分准备，对党员和干部已有初步结论。并邀请群众代表都来参加，并组织了廿多个中贫农临时小组，有组织地有秩序地围坐在支部的周围。会议由支部、工作组主持，对干部群众又作了一次动员，说明邀请群众参加整党的目的；接着即由党员挨次发言，谈到有些错误应由上级负责时，工作组即时公开插话说明，把应由上级负责的东西，完全承担起来。当谈到自首、贪污等错误时，即插话说明我们党对贪污、自首等错误的处理政策是坚持党的原则，分别轻重，加以处理。在一个党员检讨发言后，干部党员与群众即当场将大会转为小组会酝酿讨论，对发言者提意见，本人也根据群众意见反省或申辩，与事实有出入的加以说明，也有请旁人作证的。直至认为没意见时，就又由大会变为各种小组会，讨论对各种错误的处理。酝酿后各组当场汇报，最后根据党内党外的汇报，对各种错误分别性质，根据党章，对犯错本人及支部党员与群众再进行教育，并通过处分，当场作出结论。对好的则加以表扬，不能作出结论者继续酝酿。\n    这样党内解决与群众解决结合进行，使党员干部很快放下包袱，马上感到愉快。他们在支部与群众中很快表现了积极作用。在反省过程中，领导上趁热打铁，当场插话教育了群众，让群众当场讨论处理、处分等问题，对错误的性质及处分原则也易认识掌握。形式上是支部大会也是中贫农大会。大会又随时与小组会相结合，活泼灵便，简捷省力。其次，在这样的会上教育了党员也教育了群众，使党内教育与党外教育相结合，教育与实际解决问题相结合。有些党员，当场将贪污或多占的果实退给群众，大大提高了党的威信。第三、大会通过与小组酝酿结合的办法，使每个人有充分发言的机会，有个别偏激的意见，在酝酿时可即时受到纠正，党员对不恰当的意见，也可随时申辩。会上充满治病救人和民主说理的空气。\n    当支部完全进行过整编后，男女贫农团员已发展到二百三十多人，这时即正式成立了贫农团，选出十九个委员成立委员会。参加贫农团的四个党员，三个被选为主席和委员，票数最多的头两名都是党员。其他干部也有四个被选为委员。整编党的队伍与整编群众队伍，在步骤上恰当的配合，使较好的党员和干部即刻能到群众队伍中起积极作用，这样不但顺利，而且迅速的整编了党的队伍，同时也整编了群众队伍，使党在群众中的威信以及群众对党的认识都大大提高。\n    雪塔民主整党正式进行约一月，下一步准备划阶级成立新农会。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    编者按：雪塔村的整党运动，是中央局的一个工作团作的。其经验一般是成功的。但根据党内外意见当场作出结论，决定处分和表扬，如无充分准备则会出毛病。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—TASS reports: The Bolshevik magazine in Moscow recently published an article stating that the dismemberment of India (i.e., the so-called \"partition\") has not and cannot solve any of the problems facing India. The two dominions of Hindustan and Pakistan are entirely artificial states in terms of their people's economy and national composition. Pakistan, with a population of 70 million, is entirely a backward agricultural region. All the industry within its borders accounts for only 10 percent of the total industry in India, and it does not have a large industrial center. This typical colonial economic characteristic is only to facilitate Britain's transformation of Pakistan into an agricultural appendage. Hindustan's economy is also a typical colonial economy. The banking system constitutes a powerful means of colonial exploitation in India; except for two, India's major banks are controlled by British monopoly capitalists. India's industry is entirely dependent on British bankers. One-third of Hindustan's steel industry, all of its mining and rubber plantations, and most of its jute and tea industries are in the hands of British capitalists. British-Indian joint ventures, in which British capital occupies a leading position, are one of the important tools for British rule in India. Britain's debt to India in pounds sterling also constitutes a special means of financially enslaving India. On the surface, the British government seems to have abandoned direct and open rule over the new \"dominions,\" but British imperialism's political position in India is still so strong that the \"autonomy\" of the new \"dominions\" is actually just a formality. Although all the ministers of the Indian Federation and Pakistan, and even the Governor-General of India, are Indians, the main positions in the state organs, police, and army of the two \"dominions\" are held by the British. Several provincial governors are also British. The vast majority of British officers who served in India are still serving in the Indian army as \"volunteers.\" Sixteen of the nineteen British major generals and two hundred and sixty of the two hundred and eighty brigadier generals remaining in India have \"agreed\" to serve in the Indian army. The Bolshevik magazine concludes that the dismemberment of India has resulted in British imperialism maintaining political and economic control over India.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “分治”为名“肢解”为实　英保持对印统治  苏联布尔什维克杂志评论\n\n1948-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“分治”为名“肢解”为实\n    英保持对印统治\n    苏联布尔什维克杂志评论\n    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：莫斯科布尔什维克杂志顷著论称，印度的肢解（按即所谓“分治”），未曾而且也不能解决印度所面临的任何问题。印度斯坦和巴基斯坦两个自治领，就其人民经济及民族成份而言，都是十足的人为国家。拥有七千万人口的巴基斯坦，全是落后的农业地区，境内所有的工业，仅占印度全境工业的百分之十，它没有一个很大的工业中心。这种典型殖民地经济特点，只是为了便利于英国把巴基斯坦变成农业附属国。印度斯坦的经济也是典型的殖民地经济。银行制度构成了印度殖民地开发的强有力手段；印度的大银行，除两家以外都为英国垄断资本家所掌握。印度的工业完全依靠英国的银行家。印度斯坦钢铁业的三分之一，炼矿业及橡胶园的全部，黄麻业及茶叶的大部分都在英国资本家手中。英国资本占领导地位的英印合股公司，是英国统治印度的重要工具之一。英国欠印度的英镑债务，也构成了在金融上奴役印度的特殊手段。在表面上，英国政府似乎已放弃了对新“自治领”的直接与公开的统治，但英帝国主义在印度的政治地位还是如此强大，以致新“自治领”的“自治”实际上徒具形式。虽然印度联邦及巴基斯坦的一切部长甚至印度总督都是印度人，但两个“自治领”的国家机关、警察及军队中的主要位置，都为英国人所把持。若干省长也还是英国人。曾在印度服役之英国军官的绝大多数，仍在印军中当“志愿兵”。留印的英军少将十九人中的十六人及准将二八零人中的二六零人，已“同意”在印军中服役。布尔什维克杂志结语称，印度肢解的结果，使英帝国主义保持了在政治上及经济上对印度的统治。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th. Huachi County (newly established county in the Yuelezhen area north of Qingyang) in the Longdong Sub-region of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has achieved remarkable results in resettling migrants and refugees, and has been commended by the Border Region Government. From last winter to May of this year, in just over half a year, the county resettled 892 migrant and refugee households, totaling 3,209 people. It has successively provided disaster-stricken refugees with 145 *shi* of grain for sustenance, 11 *shi* of seeds, 14,685 *mu* of land, and 48 head of cattle. In addition, it distributed 100 *shi* of relief grain, 240 million yuan in agricultural loans, and over 80 pieces of farm tools and cooking utensils. Among them, 834 migrant households (accounting for more than 96% of the disaster victims migrating to the county) have transitioned to production and are in high spirits. According to statistics from four townships in Baima District, migrant refugees have reclaimed a total of over 1,100 *mu* of wasteland. The reasons for the county's success in resettling migrants and refugees are, first of all, that responsible cadres at all levels personally took action. For example, Bai Wanjin, the district chief of Rouyuan District, and Cui Shengyun, the township chief of the second township of Baima District, and Cui Hongshan, the village chief, personally helped 25 migrant and refugee households with their own farming, cooperative planting, etc., to enable them to participate in production. Pan Junhui, the secretary of the Yuele District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others also personally went to various villages to find suitable jobs for the migrants and refugees. Secondly, cadres took the lead in helping to solve the difficulties of migrants and refugees, conducting extensive propaganda, and organizing mass mutual assistance. Yang Maoxing, the township chief of the first township of Rouyuan District, has helped refugees with a total of 2 *shi* and 2 *dou* of grain since last winter. Cui Shengyun, the township chief of the second township of Baima District, voluntarily provided 1 *shi* and 5 *dou*, and Cui Hongshan, the village chief, provided 1 *shi* and 2 *dou*. Influenced by the friendly spirit of cadres at all levels, the masses also actively helped. Li Changsheng, a farmer in the third township of Rouyuan, voluntarily donated 1 *shi* and 3 *dou* of grain to help Wang Zhangao and other four migrant households settle down. Cadres also held meetings of old residents and migrant refugees in the countryside, widely publicizing the suffering caused to the people by natural disasters and the principle that \"farmers all over the world are one family,\" which greatly strengthened the unity and mutual assistance among the working people. The county government also distributed the 240 million yuan in agricultural loans allocated by the special commissioner in a timely manner, and extracted 2.85 million yuan of agricultural loans from the Wentai, Yuele, and Rouyuan districts to establish eight blacksmith shops to manufacture farm tools, directly helping migrants and refugees solve the difficulties of farm tools.\n\nIn the letter of commendation from Lin Boqu, Yang Mingxuan, and Liu Jingfan, the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Border Region Government, to Zhang Jiantang, the county magistrate of the county, it said: \"Your county has achieved success in resettling migrants and refugees. The reason is that you have jumped out of the circle of empty talk (but indeed have not jumped out in some other areas) and have done the work in a down-to-earth and responsible manner. This responsible spirit of serving the people should be maintained and is worth promoting. It is hoped that you will continue to work hard and do all your work with the same spirit.\"\n\nHowever, there are still areas for improvement in the county's resettlement of migrants and refugees, such as the failure of some districts (such as Wentai and Yuele districts) to distribute agricultural loans in a timely manner or to assist immigrants in purchasing essential production materials with agricultural loans; and in some places, there is still a phenomenon of excessive adherence to procedures in resettling migrants and refugees.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华池安置移难民有成绩　陕甘宁边府予以表扬\n\n1948-07-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华池安置移难民有成绩\n    陕甘宁边府予以表扬\n    【新华社西北四日电】陕甘宁陇东分区华池县（庆阳以北悦乐镇地区新设县）安置移民难民工作，成绩卓著，获得边府之表扬。该县从去冬至今年五月半年多内，安置移难民八百九十二户，共三千二百零九人；先后共给灾难民调剂口粮一百四十五石，种子十一石，土地一万四千六百八十五亩，耕牛四十八头；此外并发放救济粮一百石，农贷二万万四千万元及农具、炊具八十余件。其中八百卅四户移民（占移往该县灾民户百分之九十六强）已转入生产，情绪很高。据白马区四个乡的统计，移民难民已开荒共一千一百余亩。该县安置移难民工作获得成绩之原因，首先是各级负责干部亲自动手。如柔远区区长白万金，白马区二乡乡长崔生云，该乡村长崔红山等人，亲自帮助廿五户移民难民自耕、伙种等，使他们参加生产。悦乐区中共区委书记潘均会等，也亲到各村为移难民找适当工作。其次是干部带头，帮助解决移民难民困难，进行广泛宣传与组织群众互助。柔远区一乡乡长杨茂兴，自去年冬至今共帮助难民粮食二石二斗。白马区二乡乡长崔生云自动救助一石五斗，该乡村长崔红山拿出了一石二斗。群众受各级干部此种友爱精神影响，也纷纷踊跃帮助。柔远三乡农民李长胜即自动捐粮一石三斗，帮助移民王占皋等四户安家。干部并在农村召开老户与移民难民会议，广泛宣传胡祸天灾给人民造成的痛苦和“天下农民是一家”的道理，大大加强了劳动人民间的团结互助。县府发放专署拨予之两万万四千万元农贷也很及时，并在温台、悦乐、柔远三区抽出农贷二百八十五万元，设铁匠炉八处制造农具，直接帮移民难民解决农具困难。\n    在边府正副主席林伯渠、杨明轩、刘景范给该县县长张建堂的表扬信中说：你县在安置移难民方面是有成绩。原因是由于你们已经跳出了说空话的圈子（但确实在其他好些地区未曾跳出），踏实负责的做了工作。这种为人民服务的负责精神，是应该保持并值得发扬的。尚望继续努力，用同一精神做好一切工作”。\n    但该县安置移难民工作尚有待改进之处，如有些区（如温台、悦乐两区）农贷尚未能及时发放或未以农贷协助移民购进生产必需品；有的地方安置移难民尚有过分拘泥手续的现象。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-06",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Tang County's Production Promotion Cooperative\n　　　　　I\n　　The Tang County Production Promotion Cooperative was established by merging the former County United Cooperative and the Industry and Commerce Section. It consists of the Production Guidance Department, the Credit Department, and the Business Department, with a total of thirty-two cadres. In addition to general cadres, the Production Guidance Department has also established some specialized cadres, including a well-digging and waterwheel installation team, two cadres specifically in charge of滩地 [滩地 are flat areas of land alongside a river, typically sandy or muddy and often used for farming] (i.e., the director and a member of the Tang River 滩地 Management Committee), a livestock team (specifically in charge of livestock breeding in the mountainous areas of the First, Second, and Third Districts), and a team leading textile production. There are plans to establish a forestry team as well. If the Diligent Service Cooperative and the Superior Resistance Cooperative develop, more specialized cadres will be added. In the future, these specialized cadres must be combined with mass production organizations such as the 滩地 Representatives' Meeting, the Textile Representatives' Meeting, and active afforestation members, and devote themselves specifically to these production endeavors.\n　　Branch cooperatives are established entirely based on the production needs of the masses. In order to solve the livelihood problems of disaster victims in the First and Second Districts, a branch cooperative was established in these districts. Its task is to combine grain loans with production to solve the livelihood difficulties of the disaster victims—currently, this mainly involves lending cloth to the masses for running and selling, establishing shoe factories, and organizing women to make shoes. In order to develop the textile industry in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Districts, a branch cooperative specializing in textile business was established there. The branch cooperatives are not established evenly across districts, nor do they operate behind closed doors without regard for the production of the masses, as some cooperatives did in the past. They are established entirely to develop specific production undertakings and solve the production demands of the masses.\n　　　　II\n　　Currently, the Tang County Production Promotion Cooperative and its branch cooperatives are engaged in the following businesses: First, directly organizing grain and loan provisions. At present, the Promotion Cooperative has directly organized loans of 9,627 catties of agricultural grain, and 1,277,000 yuan (边币 [border region currency], mainly used for well-digging, buying livestock, and buying small carts), to 54 poor peasant households and 23 middle peasant households in nine villages. Textile loans of 10,394 catties of grain and 14 catties of thread have been provided to 97 poor peasant households and 18 middle peasant households in seven villages. Marketing and sales loans of 427 catties of grain, 2,400,000 yuan, and 1,840 bolts of cloth have been provided to 155 poor peasant households in sixteen villages. Industrial workshop loans of 666 catties of grain and 30,000,000 yuan (for making small carts, weaving machines, and hatching chicks) have been provided to a total of 310 poor peasant households and 41 middle peasant households.\n　　Grain and loans are provided to the masses as conveniently as possible, giving rice to those who want it and money to those who prefer it. The cloth lent to the disaster areas in the First and Second Districts for marketing was purchased by the Promotion Cooperative with rice. According to their experience, it is best to lend the masses the supplies they need. The Promotion Cooperative collected thread in the Fourth District to lend to weaving households, and commissioned the wood factory of the United Cooperative in the Sixth District to make fifty small carts to lend to households in need, ensuring that the borrowers used the grain and money for the intended purposes. Second, in agriculture, the main task of the Promotion Cooperative is to help the masses dig wells, install waterwheels, buy livestock, buy farm implements, and regulate seeds through grain loans. Seeds have already been regulated, and two teams have been dispatched to install waterwheels. Third, in sideline occupations, the Promotion Cooperative plans to turn the First and Second Districts into general shoe-making and marketing areas. It has already lent out 1,840 bolts of cloth and is currently working to establish shoe factories in the First and Second Districts. Adding to the two existing factories in the Second District, this could solve the livelihood problems of six to eight hundred people.\n　　　　III\n　　To accomplish the above tasks, the Production Promotion Cooperative needs to set up a large number of specialized cadres. It has already exceeded its staffing quota by thirteen people, and may exceed it by twenty or thirty people in the future. How will their living expenses be resolved? The County Promotion Cooperative purchases native cloth in Tang County City and the Nan Diantou market, which not only develops the textile industry but also generates legitimate handling fees from its operations, with an annual net profit of over 60 million yuan. Solving the expenses of twenty to thirty cadres should not be a problem. (Editor's note: Is such a large organization necessary? It is worth considering.)\n　　　　IV\n　　The old County Cooperative was taken over by the Promotion Cooperative. The United Village Cooperatives in each district (except the Seventh District, which did not have one) used to operate supply and marketing, weaving factories, shoe factories, pharmacies, wood factories, and flower rooms. Some did quite well. The Promotion Cooperative did not uniformly withdraw shares, cancel, or take over these organizations. Instead, it preserved and supported those that were beneficial to the masses and eliminated those that were not. After research, it was decided to abolish all weaving factories (one in each of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Districts) and lend or sell the machines to the masses because it is more beneficial to treat weaving as a sideline occupation in rural areas. Running factories is prone to losses, and many have collapsed. The supply and marketing business was also generally terminated. In the past, when the enemy blockaded the area, it was beneficial for mountain areas to set up offices to purchase necessities from enemy-occupied areas and supply them to the village cooperatives. Now that transportation in the liberated areas is convenient, village cooperatives can freely go to the market to buy, so the supply and marketing function of the United Village Cooperatives is no longer necessary. Shoe factories, pharmacies, wood factories, and flower rooms are all preserved and developed, with the focus on improving management methods and overcoming bureaucratization. (Editor's note: Overcoming bureaucratization and improving management methods are both very necessary, but to achieve this, many incorrect views must be overcome, such as the relief viewpoint, egalitarianism, dispersing machines, and using people mainly based not on production needs but on abstract political qualifications and poor peasant composition, etc.) This will allow them to provide more benefits to the masses. After the United Village Cooperatives are closed, the funds will be used to solicit the opinions of the masses to decide whether to return them or use them for other production businesses that are beneficial to the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 唐县的生产推进社\n\n1948-07-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　唐县的生产推进社\n  　　　　　一\n    唐县生产推进社是由原县联社与实业科合并成立的，下设生产指导部、信用部及业务部，共有干部三十二人。生产指导部除一般干部外，又设立了一些专业干部，有一个打井按水车小组，两个专管滩地的干部（即唐河滩地管理委员会的主任及委员），一个畜牧小组（专管一、二、三区山地繁殖牲畜事业），一个领导纺织的小组，还计划再设一个造林组。如果勤务社、优抗社发展起来，再增专门干部。这些专业干部，以后得与群众性的生产组织如滩地代表会、纺织代表会、造林积极分子等相结合，专门致力于这些生产事业。\n    分社是完全根据群众生产的需要建立起来的。为了解决一、二区灾民的生活问题，他们在一、二区建立了一个分社，它的任务是结合贷粮，通过生产，解决灾民的生活困难，——目前主要是贷给群众布匹跑运销，与建立鞋厂，组织妇女做鞋。为了发展四、五、六、七区的纺织事业，在那里设立了一个专门经营纺织业务的分社。分社不是按区平均设立，也不象过去有些合作社关门经营而不问群众生产，它是完全为了发展一定的生产事业，解决群众生产上的要求建立的。\n    　　　　二\n    目前唐县生产推进社及其分社所经营的业务有以下几种：第一、直接举办贷粮贷款。目前经推进社直接组织出贷的，计有农业贷粮九六二七斤，贷款边币一、二七七、○○○元（主要用于打井、买牲口、买小车），贷给九个村的贫农五四户，中农二三户。纺织贷粮一○三九四斤，线子十四斤，贷给七个村贫农九十七户，中农十八户。运销贷粮四二七斤，款二、四○○、○○○元，布一八四○匹，贷给十六村贫农一五五户。工业作坊贷粮六六六斤，款三○、○○○、○○○元（作小车，织布机与孵小鸡），共贷给贫农三一○户，中农四一户。\n    贷粮贷款尽量给群众以便利，愿要米者给米，愿要款者给款。一、二区贷给灾区运销的布匹，是推进社了米买来的。根据他们的经验，以贷群众所需要的实物为最好。推进社在四区收了线贷给织布户，在六区联合社木工厂定作五十辆小车，贷给需车户，保证了借贷户把所贷粮款用于正途。第二、在农业上，推进社主要的任务是通过贷粮，帮助群众打井、置水车、买牲口、买农具、调剂种子。目前已调剂了种子，并派了两个组去做水车。第三、在副业上，推进社拟把一、二区变成普遍的做鞋区和运销区。现已贷出一八四○匹布，正着手在一、二区再建立鞋厂，加上二区原有的二个，可解决六百至八百人的生活问题。\n    　　　　三\n    为完成以上的任务，生产推进社要设大量专业干部，现已超过编制十三个人，将来再发展可能超过二、三十人，他们的生活如何解决？县推进社在唐县城内与南店头集上收买土布，既发展了纺织事业，又从经营中取得一部正当的手续费，每年约收入纯利六千余万元，解决二十至三十个干部的开支是不会成问题的。（编者按：机构是否需要如此庞大？值得考虑。）\n    　　　　四\n    旧县社由推进社接收了。各区的联村社（只七区没有）过去经营供销、织布工厂、鞋厂、药社、木工厂、花房等业务，有的作得不错。推进社对于他们不是一律退股取消或接收，而是保存并扶植对群众有利的，取消对群众没有好处的。经研究结果，把织布工厂（一、二、三、四区各一个）一律取消，机子贷卖给群众，因为在农村中，把织布作为副业比较更有利，搞成工厂容易赔钱，很多都垮了台。供销业务一般也结束了，过去敌人封锁，山区办处到敌区统一采买必需品供给村社，对群众是有利的；现解放区交通便利，各村社可自由到市场去买，联村社供销即不必要了。鞋厂、药社、木工厂、花房，全部保存并加以发展，中心是改进经营方式，克服机关化，（编者按：克服机关化和改善经营方式两点，十分必要，但要做到此点，就必须克服许多不正确的观点，如救济观点、平均主义、分散机器、用人主要不是按照生产需要而是按照抽象的政治资格、贫雇成份等。）使能对群众有更多好处。联村社结束后，其资金征求群众意见，决定退回或用于其他对群众有利的生产业务。"

    "content": "International Week\n    (June 26th to July 2nd)\n    　　　　European Front:\n    Following the reactionary London Six-Nation Conference, the Soviet Union and seven Eastern European New Democratic countries held an eight-nation foreign ministers' conference in Warsaw from June 23rd to 24th. This conference put forward a \"program for the German question that serves the interests of all countries and truly serves the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism\" (Molotov). The conference issued a solemn declaration stating the two basic attitudes of the eight countries on the German question. First, the eight governments firmly oppose the London secret agreement concluded by the six countries of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. This secret agreement aims to ultimately split Germany politically and economically, obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, resist the demilitarization and democratization of Germany, restore Germany's war potential, and make West Germany's economy subordinate to US-British capital, etc. These measures violate the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. Second, the eight governments are willing to follow the spirit of the Yalta and Potsdam agreements and, through the agreement of the four countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, finally demilitarize Germany, control the Ruhr heavy industry, establish a democratic provisional government for all of Germany, conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and resolve the issue of German reparations. The attitude of the Warsaw Conference on the German question has been widely sympathized with by the masses in countries such as France and Italy. The Roman Evening News stated: \"Western countries must accept the Warsaw proposal and immediately start four-country negotiations. This is the only path left for them.\"\n    In accordance with the London secret agreement, the US, British, and French authorities in Germany announced a so-called \"currency reform\" on June 18th. This order was implemented separately in West Germany starting on June 21st, replacing the Mark that originally circulated throughout Germany with a new \"Deutsche Mark.\" The purpose of this move is \"to ensure that large financial groups, especially those German monopolists who maintain close ties with US-British monopoly capital, profit; for the working people of western Germany, it is an extremely tyrannical exploitation\" (Warsaw Conference Declaration). Because as a result of this so-called \"currency reform,\" one new Mark is equivalent to ten old Marks, the value of the originally circulating Marks has been greatly reduced, and the material conditions of the working people in West Germany will inevitably deteriorate rapidly; it has also created new difficulties in economic relations with other countries. This \"currency reform\" has aroused strong protests from the German people. The German People's Committee, the German Socialist Unity Party, and the German Economic Commission, representing all strata, parties, and organizations in Germany, have successively issued declarations strongly protesting this divisive and reactionary behavior. In order to protect the interests of the German people in the Soviet occupation zone, the authorities in the Soviet occupation zone, in addition to expressing protests, had no choice but to announce that starting from the evening of June 18th, traffic between the eastern and western occupation zones would be suspended, and land and water freight could only pass after thorough inspection; and decided that starting from June 24th, currency reform would be implemented throughout the territory of the Soviet occupation zone in Germany and the entire Berlin area, ensuring that all wages and prices remain at their original levels in order to protect the interests of the working people.\n    In order to protest the Federation of Employers' refusal to re-determine wages, the Italian General Confederation of Labor issued an order on June 24th, calling on workers across the country to hold a half-day general strike on July 2nd. Following the Turin general strike on June 15th, another half-day general strike of 300,000 workers in Milan occurred on the 24th, as well as a one-day general strike of workers in the provinces of Pisa and Brescia, and a strike of 120,000 food workers nationwide on the 26th. The national one-hour general strike called for by the French General Confederation of Labor to protest the Clermont-Ferrand bloodshed took place on time on June 19th. Following an agreement with the factory, the general strike in the city of Clermont-Ferrand has ended. The general strike of 250,000 steelworkers in Belgium has also ended, and workers can receive a \"diligence bonus\" roughly equal to three percent of their original wages. The strike of 20,000 dockworkers in the Port of London, England, continues to persist despite various threats from the Labor Party government and labor traitors. 11,000 dockworkers in Liverpool and Birkenhead are now also holding sympathy strikes to support the dockworkers in London.\n    　　　　American Front:\n    The Second Session of the 80th US Congress adjourned on June 20th. Under the collusion of the reactionary factions of the Republican and Democratic parties, this session passed the $6.03 billion \"foreign aid\" appropriation bill (including $4 billion for the \"Marshall Plan\" and $400 million for the \"Aid to China (Chiang)\" plan) to support reactionary forces in Western Europe and the Far East, and also passed a conscription bill calling for American youth aged 19 to 25 to serve for 21 months, as well as a huge military budget of around $14 billion. The last few days of the US Congress meeting saw fierce struggles over the \"foreign aid\" appropriation bill. The House of Representatives passed it on June 4th, reducing the total amount of \"foreign aid\" appropriations from $6.533 billion for twelve months to $5.933 billion for fifteen months. Subsequently, the Senate passed a bill on the 16th for $6.125 billion for twelve months. The final compromise appropriation bill passed by the joint committee of the two houses was nominally $6.003 billion for fifteen months.\n    The US Republican National Convention, which opened in Philadelphia (Philadelphia) on June 21st, passed a reactionary platform on the 23rd that represents the interests of American financial capitalists. This platform advocates continuing to pursue an aggressive foreign policy and implementing labor repression domestically. Under the behind-the-scenes manipulation of financial tycoons and party bosses, reactionary figures New York Governor Dewey and California Governor Warren were \"elected\" as the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates in this year's election.\n    　　　　Far East Front:\n    Mass uprisings in Malaya against British oppressive policies and ethnic discrimination have been expanding in June. The occurrence of this incident is the result of the British Malayan ruling authorities adopting policies of economic plunder and anti-communist and anti-democratic policies; however, the British authorities continue to adopt high-handed policies and fabricate rumors that the Chinese Communist Party participated in the incident. After the riots occurred, the British authorities granted the military and police \"special emergency powers\" and implemented crazy suppression. As of June 22nd, 821 people had been arrested, and on June 24th alone, 22 people were expelled from Singapore and the Federation of Malaya.\n    The Siamese fascist war criminal Luang Phibunsongkhram government, in cooperation with the Kuomintang secret service, carried out a large-scale arrest of overseas Chinese in mid-June. Overseas Chinese schools and organizations were subjected to searches; the principal and faculty of Nanyang Middle School, the General Association for National Construction and Saving the Homeland of Overseas Chinese, the Education Association, and democratic figures such as the General Labor Union have been arrested. Siamese overseas Chinese democratic newspapers such as Quanmin Bao and Bangkok Shangbao have been monitored, and the Ministry of Interior of the Luang Phibunsongkhram government is plotting to expel a large number of overseas Chinese democratic figures.\n    The Viet Minh commemorated the \"1000th Day of Viet Minh Resistance\" on June 21st. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a statement condemning France's conspiracy to establish a puppet government, and announced: \"All agreements that the puppet government and any foreign country may conclude are invalid.\" At the same time, General Nguyen Binh, supreme commander of the Viet Minh army in South Vietnam, ordered the arrest and prosecution of Nguyen Van Xuan, chairman of the Vietnamese puppet \"Provisional Central Government.\"\n    On June 23rd, Japan broke out with a major strike at 24 universities and colleges. As of the 26th, 110 schools had been drawn into the strike wave, with striking students protesting the government's proposal to increase tuition fees.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国际一周\n\n1948-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：国际一周\n\n　　国际一周\n    （六月二十六日至七月二日）\n    　　　　欧洲方面：\n    在反动的伦敦六国会议之后，苏联及东欧七个新民主主义国家于六月二十三日至二十四日在华沙举行了八国外长会议。这个会议提出了“切合一切国家的利益而且真正为和平、民主和社会主义事业服务的对德问题方案”（莫洛托夫）。会议发表了严正的宣言，表明了八个国家在对德问题上的两个基本态度。第一，八国政府坚决反对美英法比荷卢六国缔结的伦敦密约，该密约旨在从政治上经济上最终分裂德国，阻挠对德和约的缔结，抗拒德国非军国主义化与民主化，恢复德国的战争潜力，使西德的经济附属于美英资本等等，这些破坏雅尔塔波茨顿协议的措施。第二，八国政府愿意遵照雅尔塔及波茨顿协议的精神，以苏美英法四国协议的办法，使德国最后非军国主义化，管制鲁尔重工业，建立全德民主临时政府，缔结对德和约以及解决德国赔偿问题。华沙会议对德国问题的态度，受到法意等国群众广泛的同情。罗马新闻晚报说：“西方国家必须接受华沙建议，并立即开始四国谈判，这是留给他们的唯一道路。”\n    按照伦敦密约，德境美、英、法当局六月十八日宣布了所谓“货币改革”，这个命令于六月二十一日起在西德单独实行，以新的“德意志马克”代替原来流通德国全境的马克。这一勾当的目的，“在于保证大财阀，首先是那些与美英独占资本维持密切联系的德国独占资本家获利；对于德国西部劳动人民，则是极端横暴的剥削”（华沙会议宣言）。因为这个所谓“货币改革”的结果，一个新马克等于十个旧马克，原来流通的马克价值大大地贬低了，西德劳动人民的物质条件，必然加速的恶化；对其他各国经济关系也造成了新的困难。这种“货币改革”，引起德国人民的强烈抗议。代表全德各阶层、各党派、各团体的德国人民委员会、德国统一社会党和德国经济委员会，都相继发表宣言，强烈抗议这种分裂的反动行为。为了保护苏占区德国人民的利益，苏占区当局除表示抗议外，亦不得已宣布自六月十八日晚起，停止东西占领区之间的交通，水陆货运也必须经过彻底检查后才许通过；并决定自六月二十四日起，在德境苏占区和大柏林区的整个领土内实行货币改革，保证一切工资物价维持原有水平，以保护劳动人民的利益。\n    为了反对厂主联合会拒绝重新厘定工资的要求，意大利总工会于六月二十四日发出命令，号召全国工人在七月二日举行总罢工半天。六月十五日都灵总罢工之后，二十四日又发生了三十万米兰工人的半天总罢工，彼萨及布里西亚省工人的一天总罢工，和廿六日全国十二万食品工人的罢工。法国总工会为抗议克勒蒙腓隆流血事件所号召的全国一小时总罢工，已于六月十九日按时举行。在与厂方获得协议以后，克勒蒙腓隆城的总罢工已告结束。比利时廿五万钢铁工人的总罢工亦已结束，工人可获得约等于原有工资的百分之三的“计勤酬金”。英国伦敦港两万码头工人的罢工，不顾工党政府和工贼们的各种威胁，仍在坚持中。利物浦及伯肯黑德的一万一千码头工人现亦举行同情罢工，以声援伦敦的码头工人。\n    　　　　美国方面：\n    美国第八十届国会第二次会议已于六月二十日闭幕。在共和与民主两党反动派的串演下，这次会议通过了扶植西欧与远东反动势力的六十亿三千万元的“援外”拨款法案（其中包括“马歇尔计划”四十亿元与“援华（蒋）计划”四亿元），又通过了征召十九岁至二十五岁美国青年服役二十一个月的征兵法案以及一百四十亿元左右的庞大军事预算。美国国会最后几天的会议，在“援外”拨款法案问题上展开了激烈的斗争。众院于六月四日通过。将“援外”拨款总数由为期十二个月的六十五亿三千三百万元，削减为十五个月的五十九亿三千三百万元。其后，参院又于十六日通过了为期十二个月、为数六十一亿二千五百万元的法案。最后在两院联席委员会上通过的，是名义上仍为十五个月的六十亿零三千万元的折衷拨款法案。\n    自六月二十一日起在费城（费拉得尔非亚）召开的美国共和党全国代表大会，于二十三日通过了代表美国金融资本家利益的反动政纲。这一政纲主张对外继续执行侵略外交，对内实行压迫劳工。在金融巨头与党魁们的幕后操纵之下，反动分子纽约州州长杜威与加利福尼亚州州长华伦，被“选”为该党今年大选中的正副总统候选人。\n    　　　　远东方面：\n    马来亚反抗英国压迫政策和民族歧视的群众暴动，在六月份内日益扩大。这次事件的发生，是英国马来亚统治当局采取经济掠夺及反共反民主政策的结果；但英国当局仍继续采取高压政策，并捏造中国共产党参与此次事件的谣言。暴动发生以后，英国当局授予军警“特别紧急权力”，实行疯狂的镇压。迄六月二十二日止，已有八百二十一人被捕，仅六月二十四日一天，自新加坡及马来亚联邦被逐出境者即达二十二人。\n    暹罗法西斯战犯銮披汶政府，在国民党特务机关合作之下，六月中旬对华侨大肆搜捕。华侨学校和社团横遭搜查；南洋中学校长、教职员、华侨建国救乡总会、教育协会及职工总会等民主人士已有四十一人横遭逮捕。暹罗华侨民主报纸如全民报、曼谷商报等均被监视，銮披汶政府内政部并蓄谋将大批华侨民主人士驱逐出境。\n    越盟于六月二十一日纪念“越盟抵抗千日纪念日”。越南民主共和国总统胡志明发表声明，斥责法国成立走狗政府的阴谋，并宣布：“走狗政府和任何外国可能缔结的一切协定概属无效”。同时，南越越盟军最高指挥官阮平将军，下令缉捕越南伪“临时中央政府主席”阮文春归案法办。\n    日本于六月二十三日爆发了二十四所大学及高等学校的大罢课。至二十六日止，已有一百一十所学校卷入罢课浪潮，罢课学生抗议政府增加学费的建议。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北三日电】"

Before their departure, a certain militia cadre unit specially set up a memorial altar to mourn the parents, brothers, and sisters who died under Yan's bandit \"self-confession and rebirth\" atrocities. Zhang Zhenji walked to his father's memorial tablet and only said one sentence: \"Father, you died so unjustly!\" Tears welled up in his eyes, and he couldn't stop crying. Fifty-two children of martyrs successively took the stage to denounce Yan's bandit crimes and held a solemn oath before the memorial tablet: \"Parents, brothers, and sisters! We will definitely fight Yan Xishan, the murderer, to the end! Eliminate Yan Xishan and avenge you!\" They also resolutely guaranteed to the Party: \"When we get to the front, we will work actively, fight bravely, and strive to earn merits.\" Li Chengren said: \"I applied to join the Party three times, and now it has been approved. I only have one thought now: to capture more prisoners and seize more guns on the battlefield.\" Some soldiers even bit their fingers to write blood oaths to show their determination. Gao Zhiyi, the platoon leader of the first company, swore: \"I will strive to earn merits on the front line and strive to be converted from a probationary party member to a full party member.\" The Jinzhong Eighth Sub-district issued a combat mobilization order. At the mobilization meeting, the commander and political commissar of the sub-district emphasized that all Party policies must be implemented in combat, and this would test the Party spirit of Party committees, branches, and members at all levels. After the meeting, a small number of cadres and soldiers reviewed their own erroneous thoughts of wanting to \"make a fortune\" in the plains and decided to resolutely correct them. A certain unit also established a discipline inspection team to resolutely ensure that the unit becomes a model for implementing policies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地武民兵出发宣誓　向阎锡山复仇\n\n1948-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　地武民兵出发宣誓\n    向阎锡山复仇\n    【新华社晋绥二日电】“向阎锡山复仇!”向阎占区进军的晋中地方武装中传遍了这一悲愤口号。某民兵干部队于出征之前，特设灵公祭死于阎匪“自白转生”暴行下的父母兄妹。张振基走到他的父亲灵前，只说了一句：“爹爹，你死得好冤呀！”他就眼泪直涌，哭不成声了。五十二位烈士子弟相继登台控诉阎匪罪恶，并举行灵前悲壮宣誓：“爹妈兄妹们！我们一定和凶手阎锡山拼到底！消灭阎锡山，为你们报仇！”他们并坚决向党保证：“我们到前方，积极工作，英勇作战，争取立功。”李成仁说：我三次要求入党，现在被批准了。我现在只有一个思想：上战场多捉俘虏多缴枪。”有的战士为表明决心，甚至咬破指头写血书。一连排长高志义宣誓：“我争取火线立功，争取候补党员转为正式党员。”晋中八分区颁布了作战动员令。在动员大会上，分区司令员及政委强调指出作战中必须执行党的各种政策，并以此考验各级党委、支部和党员的党性。会后，少数干部、战士检讨了自己还夹杂了想到平川“发洋财”的错误思想，决定坚决加以改正。某部并成立了纪律检查组，坚决保证本部成为执行政策的模范。"

    "content": "[Taihang News] Lingdong Village in the first district of Huguan County, where cadres actively lead production, and Xiguanbi Village, where cadres lie down and do nothing, and let production run wild. As a result, the production work in these two villages showed two different situations, one good and one bad.\n\nLingdong Village has 581 mu of autumn land, with a total labor force of 54 and a half people, both men and women, young and old. Each mu requires 4 workdays, requiring a total of 2,324 workdays. If all the labor force is mobilized, it will take 40 days to complete the sowing. However, the cadres led the masses, using precise calculation methods, and after organizing, used 1,706 workdays to successfully complete the sowing by the Xiaoman solar term. They also selected five people to engage in small businesses such as collecting eggs, earning 220,000 yuan (Jicha, same below). Forty-two women weave nets, earning 640,000 yuan. The collectively organized spinning, weaving, coal pulling, and credit cooperative earned 218,000 yuan, for a combined total of 1,078,000 yuan. The whole village benefited from both agriculture and sideline occupations. The main reason is that they were organized and the cadres actively led. The agricultural association chairman—labor hero Zhao Quan—led the Cui Tangbao mutual aid team, implementing the principle of democratic and voluntary leadership. During the rectification, if the men were unwilling to combine with weaving, they were allowed to separate voluntarily. The team had 80 mu of autumn land, with no livestock, only five male laborers and seven female laborers, which was not enough. The masses voluntarily raised 118,000 yuan and bought two oxen, which plowed all the autumn land in the team and also helped other teams plow, earning 420 jin of rice. After deducting the cost of cattle feed, the remaining 200 jin of rice were distributed as dividends according to shares. The shareholders benefited, and the whole team also solved the problem of livestock power. Everyone was very happy.\n\nThe cadres of Xiguanbi misunderstood the spirit of the democratic party rectification policy, lay down and did nothing, and did not lead production at all. They also said: \"If they don't help each other, the masses are very energetic, and sideline production can make a lot of money.\" The cadres do not work, waiting to \"pass the test\" in the future. The village's production runs wild. As a result, both agriculture and sideline occupations were not done well. When they were engaged in agriculture, everyone scrambled to sell red soil, so that the land was not sown well. Selling red soil is very profitable, but because it was not organized, they went to sell it separately. Everyone was afraid of not being able to sell it, and they topped each other, making the red soil worthless, and both agriculture and sideline occupations suffered.

Nanni, the party leader, delivered a speech to the congress on the 29th, stating that the policy of the People's Democratic Front is the logical consequence of the entire policy of proletarian unity followed by the Socialist Party since 1943. Nanni pointed out that the congress faced only two paths – either to be with the working class or to oppose the working class. He said that the policy of the International Socialist Conference (Note: This right-wing Socialist conference was held in Vienna last month) completely echoes the US policy of establishing an anti-Soviet Western European alliance, and the result will inevitably lead to war. Nanni emphasized that the Socialist Party must not have anything in common with this policy, because the Socialist Party knows that the existence and security of the Soviet Union is the main and most reliable guarantee of the interests of the working people and the cause of peace.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd. A certain unit of the Subei Corps of the People's Liberation Army has universally established an organization of health soldiers in its companies, establishing mass medical work. Each squad in the company has one health soldier, and each platoon has a health team leader (or health committee member). One of the team leaders also serves as the company headquarters' health worker. Health soldiers are also set up among the service personnel. Health soldiers are democratically elected by the squad and then approved by the entire company's soldiers' committee. Health soldiers participate in the study and discussion of various health knowledge; in peacetime, they promote and supervise the establishment of various health systems in each squad, understand and report on health conditions; in wartime, they promptly rescue and bandage the wounded without hindering combat. Under the leadership of Wu Wendao, a model health soldier in the seventh squad of the second battalion of a certain detachment, none of the soldiers in the squad suffered from scabies or lice. In addition, health soldiers of a certain detachment cooperate with medical personnel to carry out \"four checks\" before and after marching, that is, checking whether they have drunk enough water, whether their shoes fit, whether they have washed their feet after arriving at their destination, and whether there are any sick soldiers. This is of great help to the health of the troops. Liu Mang, the health team leader of a certain team, timely used a tourniquet to bandage the first squad leader whose artery was broken, and then carried him to the bandage station for surgery, saving the squad leader's life. In a certain company, more than ten people were wounded in battle, and except for one who was bandaged on the battlefield by medical personnel, the rest were rescued and bandaged by health soldiers. According to the statistics of the unit, the number of wounded rescued and bandaged by health soldiers on the battlefield has increased from 25% to 45%, and even to 70% in the past year. Health soldiers have become powerful assistants to medical work. The unit has now summarized the experience of organizing health soldiers: First, leaders at all levels should attach importance to this work; second, health work should also be regarded as one of the conditions for evaluating merit; third, the medical department should provide timely and specific help to health soldiers and try to help health soldiers establish prestige. The unit is now actively training and cultivating a large number of company health soldiers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平时保健战时救伤　华中部队设卫生战士　建立了群众性医务卫生工作\n\n1948-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平时保健战时救伤\n    华中部队设卫生战士\n    建立了群众性医务卫生工作\n    【新华社华东二日电】解放军苏北兵团某部在连队中普遍设立卫生战士的组织，建立了群众性的医务工作。连队中每班设卫生战士一人，每排设一个卫生组长（或称卫生委员），组长中一人兼任连部卫生工作。在勤杂人员中也同样设有卫生战士。卫生战士是由班内民主选出，再在全连士兵委员会上通过。卫生战士要参加各种卫生常识的学习和讨论；平时推动与督促各班建立各种卫生制度，了解与汇报保健情况；战时则在不妨碍战斗下及时抢救包扎伤员。该部某支队二营七班在该班模范卫生战士吴文道领导下全班没有一个战士生疥疮和虱子的。又某支队卫生战士在行军前后都配合医务人员进行“四查”工作，即查水喝足没有，鞋子合不合脚；到目的地后洗脚没有，以及有无病员。这对部队健康帮助很大。该队卫生组长刘茫及时用止血带将被打断动脉的一班长包扎起来，随后抬到包扎所开刀，救了班长的生命。某连在战斗中负伤十余名，除了其中一名由医务人员在战场上包扎外，其余都是卫生战士抢救包扎的。据该部统计，一年来卫生战士在战场上抢救包扎伤员数字，已由百分之二十五增至百分之四十五，有的甚至到百分之七十。卫生战士已成为医务工作的有力助手。现该部总结了组织卫生战士的经验：第一，各级领导上要重视这一工作；第二，应将保健工作也作为评功条件之一；第三，医务部门要给卫生战士及时与具体的帮助，设法帮助卫生战士建立威信。现该部正积极训练与培养大批连队卫生战士。"

On Drum Tower Street, countless citizens gathered in front of the announcements with melancholy expressions. To the left of the former Chiang Kai-shek's Central Bank, a group of citizens who were pushed to the back requested those standing in front of the announcements to read them aloud. Everywhere on the streets, PLA cadres and soldiers were saying goodbye to the citizens and asking for their opinions of the PLA. Everywhere, similar answers were heard: \"You are truly a good army. No one believes those past propagandas (referring to the Kuomintang's rumors and slanders) anymore. Who has ever seen an army retreat like you?\" More than a hundred students, staff members, and shop assistants, covered in sweat, carried their luggage and hurried towards the joint admissions office of various universities in the liberated areas, preparing to move with the People's Liberation Army. The headquarters' political department constantly received letters of thanks. A certain professor from Henan University sent a letter thanking the People's Liberation Army for its relief to him. Two other young people sent letters to Generals Chen Shiqu and Tang Liang, praising and expressing gratitude for the lenient policy adopted by the People's Liberation Army towards their father, who worked in a Kuomintang organization. The letter concluded with: \"We believe that the People's Liberation Army will soon return in triumph.\" With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the public order patrol team organized by the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce on the evening of the 25th maintained order in the streets. That night at ten o'clock, when a part of the People's Liberation Army began to withdraw, various colored lanterns were hung on Drum Tower Street, East Gate, and other places, and many shops set out tea in front of their houses. Citizens stood outside in groups cheering and seeing them off, continuously and enthusiastically shouting slogans supporting the People's Liberation Army.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng Front, June 28th (delayed dispatch): The People's Liberation Army voluntarily withdrew from Kaifeng on June 26th. The Front Headquarters Political Department also issued a proclamation, the full text of which is as follows:\n\nFollowing the liberation of Kaifeng, with the joint protection and efforts of our military and civilians, order in the urban area has been initially restored, and relief and reconstruction work is underway. However, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek's ambition has not died, and he attempts to gather bandit troops to re-invade Kaifeng, determined to subject Kaifeng to complete destruction. Our army, witnessing the tragedies caused by the destruction and indiscriminate bombing of Chiang's army and aircraft, could not bear to see the city's elders and brothers suffer the trauma of war again. Therefore, we had to make a temporary withdrawal from the urban area. We remember that the people of our city have long suffered oppression and devastation from Chiang's bandits. During the liberation of Kaifeng, Chiang's bandits occupied merchants' buildings and residences, resisting stubbornly street by street, and setting fires during their retreat, followed by a frenzy of indiscriminate bombing. This resulted in many prosperous urban areas being reduced to ashes, and many elders and brothers were tragically injured or killed. Nevertheless, people from all walks of life and the suburbs assisted our army in combat amidst gunfire and explosions, providing enthusiastic support, and helped our army maintain order and transport supplies after the battle. They also sincerely supported the various policies and principles of our Party and our army, which further strengthened the courage of the entire army to fight for the people. It is regrettable that we have not been able to properly comfort all the affected compatriots, and we have not been able to consult with our elders and brothers in detail on various construction projects, forcing us to make a temporary separation. We extend our deep gratitude to the people of the city and our sincere condolences to all the affected compatriots.\n\nAlthough all comrades of our army fought bravely for the liberation of Kaifeng, shedding their blood, and maintained the tradition of protecting the city and cherishing the people during the fighting, due to the short time, what we could contribute to the people of our city was still limited. Individual personnel also violated policies and discipline, and our army hereby expresses its sincere apology.\n\nWhat can be comforting to the elders and brothers of our city is that Kaifeng will ultimately belong to the people. Our army's temporary withdrawal is solely due to our love for the city and the people, so as to seek opportunities to annihilate the enemy in large numbers, thereby finally securing Kaifeng. Our army could capture Kaifeng this time, and we can liberate Kaifeng at any time in the future. The re-capture of Luoyang and its embarkation on the road to construction is proof of this. At present, our People's Liberation Army is launching a victorious offensive throughout the country. Chiang's bandits cannot reverse their irreversible defeat. Even in the Central Plains battlefield, where Chiang's bandits are piecing together all their forces to desperately contend, they are shrinking their forces and abandoning cities under the iron fists of our Liu-Deng, Chen-Su, and Chen-Xie armies. Not only can the People's Liberation Army capture Kaifeng, but it will also powerfully seize all major cities in the country. The victory of the people's revolutionary war is not far away. We would like to take this opportunity to wish the people of Kaifeng eternal liberation.\n\nThe enthusiastic love and care of the people of the city for our army will never be forgotten by our army, and we will strive to fight for the liberation of Kaifeng, the liberation of the Central Plains, and the liberation of all of China. We sincerely hope that the people of the city will temporarily endure the pain of Chiang's bandits' return, inherit the glory of resisting tyranny and striving for liberation in the past, and wage an unyielding struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique. If you cannot bear the devastation and cannot make a living, our Party and our army sincerely welcome people from all walks of life, including industry and commerce, education, social elites, and educated youth, to come to the liberated areas to find employment, study, and participate in various construction projects in the liberated areas, and work together to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and build a new China. As for the officials of the Kuomintang government and the responsible personnel of its affiliated economic, cultural, and other agencies, as well as all employees, we hope that they will not leave their posts without authorization when our army returns, so as not to cause unnecessary losses to these agencies due to lack of supervision. We especially hope that the broad masses of Chiang's army officers and soldiers will deeply understand the righteousness of the matter, stop risking their lives for the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique, and stop making futile resistance. They should also deeply repent of their past crimes of ravaging the people, understand the deep suffering and disasters of the people of Kaifeng, and arouse their patriotic and loving conscience to protect the people. If anyone dares to persist in evil and continue to persecute the people, our army will impose severe sanctions and treat their ringleaders as war criminals. This proclamation is hereby issued.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我军撤出开封布告\n\n1948-07-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我军撤出开封布告\n    【新华社开封前线六月廿八日电】（迟到）人民解放军于六月二十六日主动撤离开封。前线司令部政治部并发布文告，全文如下：查开封解放后，在我军民协力保护共同努力下，市区秩序已初告恢复，善后救济及各种建设工作，正在开始，乃蒋贼心犹未死，妄图纠集匪部，重犯开封，必欲置开封于全部毁灭而后快。本军目睹市民遭受蒋军破坏蒋机滥炸所遭致之惨祸，不忍全市父老兄弟于创巨痛深之余重受战争灾难之迫害，不得不自市区作暂时之撤退。念我全市人民长期受蒋匪压迫摧残，此次解放开封之役，复因蒋匪霸占商民建筑住宅，逐街顽抗，且由于退却时纵火焚烧，复加以疯狂滥炸，以致许多繁华市区化成灰尽，许多父老兄弟，惨受伤亡；然我各界各业及城郊人民，犹能在枪林火海中协助我军作战，热情支援，战后复协同本军维持秩序，帮助运输：对本党本军各项政策主张，更加以真挚之拥护，诚使全军上下愈益增强为人民而战之勇气。所惜被难同胞尚未能一一妥加抚恤，各项建设，尚未能与我父老同胞一一详作商量，又不能不作暂时之分离。我们谨向全市人民致以深切的感谢，谨向所有被难同胞致以亲切的慰问。本军全体同志，虽曾为解放开封英勇作战，流出了自己的鲜血，并能于作战期间保持了保护城市爱护人民的传统，但因时间短暂，所能贡献于我全市人民者还是不多，个别人员亦有违反政策纪律之处，本军对此谨表衷诚之歉仄。\n    所可告慰于我全市父老同胞者，即开封终究必然要属于人民所有。我军之暂时撤离，仅缘于爱护城市，爱护人民，以便寻找战机，大量歼敌，从而最后确保开封。我军此次可以攻克开封，今后即可随时解放开封，洛阳之再次收复，并走上建设道路，即为明证。目前我人民解放军正在全国范围内展开胜利进攻，蒋匪无法挽回其永远不能翻身之败局，即就蒋匪拼凑全力妄图争夺之中原战场，亦在我刘邓、陈粟、陈谢三路大军铁拳打击下，收缩兵力，放弃城市，并且洛阳开封此等大城市也无法确保，人民解放军不惟可以攻克开封，且将有力夺取全国一切大城市，人民革命战争胜利之期，已在不远。我们愿于此预祝开封人民之永远解放。\n    全市人民对本军之热情爱护，本军将永不忘记，并将为解放开封解放中原解放全中国而努力战斗。深愿全市人民暂时忍受蒋匪重来之痛苦，继承过去反抗暴政争取解放之光荣，对蒋介石统治集团作不屈不挠之斗争。设或不堪蹂躏，无法为生，则凡工商教育各界，社会贤达、知识青年，本党本军一律热诚欢迎来解放区就业就学，参加解放区各种建设工作，同为打倒蒋介石建设新中国而奋斗。对国民党政府官员及所属经济文化各种机关主管人员及一切职员，务望于我军重来时，切勿擅离职守，致使各该机关因无人看管而遭受不必要之损失，至广大蒋军官兵，尤望能深明大义，勿再为蒋介石统治集团拼死卖命，徒作无益之抵抗，并应痛悔过去摧残人民之罪恶，体念开封人民深重痛苦和灾难，激发爱国爱民之天良保护人民。倘敢怙恶不悛，继续迫害人民，则本军将加以严厉之制裁，并将其首要人员以战争罪犯论罪。此布。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Beiyue News: Dizhuang Village, Fourth District of Guangling, after conducting household-by-household investigations and exposing the village cadres' exaggeration of the disaster situation, overcame the ideological barrier of relying solely on government relief, and launched a mass movement of mutual lending and assistance, thus overcoming the famine. The village has a total of 203 households, with 5,436 mu of irrigated and dry sloping land and 20 head of livestock. Due to the poor harvest last year, a famine occurred, but compared with other disaster-stricken villages in the district, it was not particularly severe. Some cadres, such as the branch secretary, security officer, and brigade cadres, harbored the idea of solely relying on government relief. In order to obtain grain and loans, they led and organized more than 30 people to go to the district to request relief, exaggerating and fabricating the disaster situation, claiming that 50 to 60 households in the village were begging for food. The county sent a working group to the village, on the one hand, to show the government's attitude of being responsible for solving the famine, and on the other hand, to conduct in-depth investigations and register each household. It was found that among the 203 households in the village, 25 households had surplus grain (generally 10 to 15 large dou, and the most 20 to 25 large dou), 54 households had enough to eat, 94 households were short for one to two months (but they had the ability to solve it themselves), and 30 households were short of grain for more than three months. Based on this specific situation, the working group immediately conducted publicity and explanation among the village cadres, criticized their mistake of exaggerating the disaster situation and concealing it from the higher authorities, and decided to remove the brigade cadre who was mainly responsible for this matter from his post. The working group pointed out that to overcome the famine in the village, it should promote mutual assistance and lending, organize the masses to produce and conserve, overcome difficulties, and not simply rely on the government. After discussing these opinions, the cadres understood and said: \"We used to think that the government had a lot of things. When we saw that other villages had grain and loans but our village didn't, we were jealous, and we didn't think it was wrong!\" Later, after calculation, they unanimously believed that relying on their own village, they had the full strength to solve the famine. Then, a mass meeting of the whole village was held to mobilize production and conservation, mutual assistance and lending to overcome the famine. Slogans such as \"A little water flows long\" and \"Eat less, drink more porridge, mix bran and vegetables to replace grain\" were put forward, calling on everyone to help and lend to each other freely and voluntarily. On the spot, the grain and fodder committee member Tang Wen voluntarily took out five small dou of grain, and the squad leader and security officer each took out two small dou. Under the influence of the cadres taking the lead, Tang Yuan took out 60,500 border currency. He Qing said: \"I have salt brought back, and I am willing to give out 14 jin to help poor people eat vegetables.\" A total of 45 households lent out 57 small dou of miscellaneous grains, 14 jin of salt, 60 jin of yam, and 120,500 border currency, which were distributed to the 30 households that lacked grain after everyone's discussion. The masses reflected: \"Everyone is satisfied with this. If they don't have anything to eat in the future, everyone will find a way.\" After the meeting, women and children were mobilized to pick wild vegetables. An average of 160 people went out to pick vegetables every day, and 3,200 jin could be collected every day, which greatly solved the difficulty of grain shortage. Now the masses' emotions are stable, and they are actively producing. The land has been fully sown, and weeding work is in progress. (Du Fa)\n\nYanggao News: Zhao Shizhuang in Yanggao's Second District is a large village with 371 households and 130 qing of cultivated land. Last year, it suffered from both drought and insect plagues, resulting in a poor harvest. In addition, the bandits of Yan Chuan robbed the village twice, causing a serious disaster. According to statistics, 35 households are currently unable to make ends meet, and a total of 145 households lack food. This spring, after sowing, there was a heavy rain, and most of the sorghum and sesame seeds could not sprout, which made the masses extremely uneasy. After discovering the disaster situation, the government first loaned 768 jin of seeds and organized the masses to rush to replant 400 mu, stabilizing the masses' production emotions. Then, 40 bolts of cloth were loaned to the disaster victims for transportation and sales, and a mass mutual assistance and self-salvation movement was launched. The whole village donated a total of 1.8 shi of miscellaneous grains, 300 jin of yam, and 5 bolts of homemade cloth, which were distributed to the 13 poorest households, and everyone was organized to produce. At present, except for five disabled households who are still in difficulty, the lives of other disaster victims have been initially resolved.

In Yan Village, Guoxian County, more than 400 people have contracted typhoid fever, and more than 60 have died. In other areas, many have died from acute gastroenteritis. The investigation revealed that the causes were: long-term starvation caused by the famine, weakened bodies, and reduced resistance; or eating poisonous grass roots; or overeating after the summer harvest. To this end, the Jin-Sui Border Region Administrative Office and the Military Region Headquarters jointly issued an order on the 20th of last month to all commissioners, military sub-district commanders, political commissars, and health agencies, to immediately begin organizing the treatment of diseases among the disaster victims, in order to further improve the disaster relief and life-saving work. The order stipulates: (1) Each administrative office and military sub-district should immediately organize the health agencies, hospitals, midwifery clinics, and health departments of the stationed military units within their respective jurisdictions, and dispatch personnel to form mobile medical teams based on the work situation and the severity of the disaster in the local area, and carry medicines to the severely affected areas for treatment. (2) The health departments of each military sub-district, all hospitals, all sanatoriums, and the health departments of the stationed military units should treat the sick disaster victims passing through their areas with a high degree of responsibility to the people. In addition, they should try their best to dispatch personnel to participate in the treatment teams. In districts and towns with medical cooperatives, doctors and medicines should be organized to go to the countryside to serve the masses. (3) All medical and drug expenses for treating disaster victims shall be waived. The required medicines shall be paid by the health departments and reimbursed uniformly. (4) While providing treatment, various health knowledge should be promoted to the masses. Due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining medicines, all doctors going to the countryside should organize rural doctors to collect proven effective prescriptions from the masses and promote them.

TASS, Helsinki: On the eve of the Finnish parliamentary elections (scheduled for July 1st and 2nd), the People's Democratic League, led by the Communist Party, and the joint camp of bourgeois and right-wing Social Democrats are engaged in an election struggle. The People's Democratic League has put forward a joint election platform. In terms of foreign policy, this platform advocates defending national independence and opposing imperialist attempts to interfere in internal affairs; ensuring peace on all borders and preventing Finnish territory from becoming a place for military adventures again; and striving for friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. In terms of domestic policy, the platform advocates the complete democratization of state institutions and the suppression of reactionaries; a thorough reform of taxation and the nationalization of large factories, banks, and key sectors of foreign trade. Prime Minister Pekkala of Finland (belonging to the Social Unity Party within the People's Democratic League) stated in a speech that the importance of this election is greater than in the past. Because whether the policies pursued by the current government will change depends on the outcome of the election. Our current political situation is not the same as in the past. The peace treaty concluded with the Soviet Union has political significance not only internationally but also domestically. Every voter should consider this fact. I sincerely hope that workers will elect candidates who represent the political trends that have gained momentum after the war in the upcoming election.\" The election speeches of the People's Democratic League have been warmly welcomed by the people.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 2nd—The counties of Dongtai and Taipei (newly established county in northern Dongtai) in Subei have overcome the severe spring famine through three months of active production and self-salvation. These two counties suffered severe losses due to the Kuomintang army's brutal \"mopping-up\" operations, coupled with a poor harvest last autumn, resulting in a widespread and severe spring famine this year. According to March statistics, 200,000 people were short of food, 30 percent of whom were completely out of food and largely subsisted on wild vegetables and shallots, making spring plowing even more difficult. In addition to calling on the masses to work hard in production and self-salvation, the local democratic government issued loans totaling 427.7 million Hua Zhong currency units to help the masses with spring plowing and develop sideline production. It also issued fishery loans of more than 53 million yuan to solve the difficulties of fishermen. Due to the increased enthusiasm of the masses for production, Dongtai County immediately eliminated 18,500 mu of wasteland, built 24 new salt fields, and restored 64 oil mills. Taipei County widely developed the textile industry. In the cotton reclamation areas of Kennan, Kenbei, and Dazhong, the masses in various townships restored more than 6,000 spinning wheels and more than 1,500 looms. Within 40 days, they spun more than 60,000 catties of cotton yarn and wove more than 17,000 bolts of cloth, which were exchanged for more than 5,200 dan of grain (100 catties per dan by market weight), solving the livelihood of more than 30,000 people. With the help of loans, the masses in the salt reclamation area also repaired 70 salt stoves, producing more than 2,600 dan of salt in more than 20 days, earning 700 dan of grain. All districts also widely carried out mass mutual assistance; government agencies and troops also tightened their belts to relieve the disaster. Taipei alone transferred more than 1,600 dan of grain, solving the food problem for more than 20,000 disaster victims who were out of food. In addition, various localities also sorted out floating wealth and distributed it to disaster victims for production. The two counties sorted out a total of more than 2,200 dan of grain, more than 33.3 million Hua Zhong currency units, more than 18,000 catties of raw cotton, and 17 catties of silver. The government also provided work relief, organizing more than 10,000 people to participate in transportation, and distributing 260,000 catties of wages in grain. Through the above efforts, the lives of the disaster victims were maintained. At present, the wheat is being harvested, and the spring famine this year has basically been overcome.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏中东台、台北灾民　生产自救渡过春荒\n\n1948-07-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏中东台、台北灾民\n    生产自救渡过春荒\n    【新华社华东二日电】苏中东台、台北（东台北部新设县）两县经三个月积极生产自救，已克服严重春荒。该两县因连遭蒋军残酷“扫荡”，群众损失惨重，加之去秋歉收，故今年春荒普遍严重。据三月份统计，缺粮者达二十万人，其中断炊者占百分之三十，大部靠野菜、小蒜度日，春耕更为困难。当地民主政府除号召群众努力生产自救外，并发放贷款华中币四亿二千七百七十万元帮助群众春耕及发展副业生产；又发放渔贷五千三百余万元，解决渔民困难。由于群众生产热情提高，东台县当即消灭了荒田一万八千五百余亩，新建盐场二十四块，恢复油坊六十四家。台北县则普遍开展纺织业。垦南、垦北、大中等棉垦区各乡群众恢复了纺车六千余架，织布机一千五百余架，四十天内共纺棉纱六万余斤，织布一万七千余匹，换回粮食五千二百余担（每担市秤百斤），解决了三万余人的生活。盐垦区群众亦在贷款帮助下修好盐灶七十付，廿余天内烧盐二千六百余担，赚粮七百担。各区并广泛开展群众性的互助；机关、部队亦节衣缩食救灾。仅台北即调剂出粮食一千六百余担，解决了两万余断炊灾民的口粮。此外各地又整理浮财，分配灾民生产，两县共整理出粮食二千二百余担，华中币三千三百余万元，皮花一万八千余斤，白银十七斤。政府又以工代赈，组织万余群众参加运输，发下工资粮二十六万斤。经上述各方面的努力，灾民生活得以维持。目前麦子登场，今年春荒基本上已经渡过。"

    "content": "Reasonable Work Point System and Democratic Leadership\n    Mutual Aid Teams in Western Anshang Consolidate\n    [Taihang News] The mutual aid team in Western Anshang Village, Sixth District of Pingshun, has improved the production enthusiasm of the masses, with everyone benefiting and the organization becoming increasingly consolidated, by implementing democratic leadership, reasonable work point system, and integrating agriculture, sideline production, and war support. The team includes twenty-eight households, one hundred and sixty-five mu of land, sixteen full laborers, five half laborers, and five auxiliary laborers, and was organized last May in response to the call of higher authorities. At that time, the whole village formed nine teams. During the winter and spring rectification of the mutual aid groups, it was proposed that participation should be democratic and voluntary, and eight teams were automatically disbanded. After several rectifications, they have not yet been successfully re-established; only the Western Anshang team has been consistently consolidated. Team members said: \"Our combination is definitely inseparable.\" The team's work point calculation method is relatively reasonable: for agricultural labor, each laborer's standard work point is ten points. Laborers are of varying strengths, so a fixed point system with flexible adjustments is implemented (work points are set based on the specific task). The current wage is four jin of rice per ten points (regardless of meals). Livestock ploughing and harrowing two and a half mu of land or more per day is worth twenty points, or the household using the livestock provides fifteen jin of grass and five jin of feed. For sideline production operated with one's own funds, the team takes 5% of the earned profit, and this 5% is then divided among all team members (including the individual). The team will cultivate their land and earn their wages. If team funds are used for production, the team takes 15% of the profit (distribution method is the same as above). If team funds are used for commercial production, the profits are divided on a public-two-private-eight basis. Those going out to participate in the war and eating public meals are assigned five points per day, plus a bonus of two points, totaling seven points. Those on errands carrying sixty jin back and forth sixty li earn ten points, and a bonus of one point for each night spent away (distant errand) (because of large expenses), and more points for carrying more. When the team was first formed, it only had 17,000 yuan (Jicha, same below) of funds, bought four trees, sawed them into boards and sold them for a profit of four shi of rice. During the wheat planting season, the autumn seedlings were very bad, and it looked like there would be a disaster. Eight laborers and five livestock were dispatched to Lucheng and other areas to do short-term work ploughing wheat fields, earning more than seven shi of millet in more than twenty days. With such active production, by the end of April this year, a total of 650,000 yuan and 92 shi and 7 dou of rice had been earned. On average, each laborer earned 25,000 yuan and 1 shi and 1 dou and 4 sheng of rice. Sang Yucai's family of seven only harvested more than three shi of coarse grains last year, and had nothing to eat by winter. He earned 250 jin of rice doing earthwork outside, and more than 70 jin doing short-term work. The team took care of his family, and he only contributed 50 jin (no more work in winter), so he still has food to eat. His wife earned more than 300 work points in labor-capital cooperation, and the rice she earned from these 300 points has not been used yet. He said: \"I have benefited greatly from the triple combination! Otherwise, I would not be able to survive now!\" Zhang Jiahe did not do his job well in the team, and only picked on others' faults, and did not change after several criticisms. In order to educate him, everyone temporarily expelled him from the team to let him try it out. As a result, he could not take care of the family and could not take care of the outside, and it was very difficult. He said to people: \"I am determined to change!\" Finally, he admitted his mistakes to everyone and was absorbed back in. Because the work point system is reasonable, some weak laborers that other teams are unwilling to accept are welcomed into this team. One person in Eastern Anshang only earned seven points (poor labor), and no extra points were added for doing more work; later, when he came to this team, he earned eight points and nine points for doing more work, and he became more and more energetic. One of the main reasons why this team can be managed relatively rationally and perfectly is that the leadership method is democratic, and can absorb and concentrate everyone's opinions at any time, come up with solutions to problems, and improve work. For example, pulling wood planks in the first month of this year was calculated by the day, one day counted as one work day, and some people were loafing on the job (being lazy); the leadership then organized everyone to discuss and found out the problems, and changed it to setting work points according to the task, and as a result, everyone worked more vigorously. Before, one person could pull at most one zhang and two chi a day, and later they pulled one zhang and six chi. For sideline production using one's own funds, the team used to take 10% of the profit, and no one was willing to go out; later, after everyone's research, it was changed to 5%, and everyone scrambled to go out and earn a lot of money.

According to reports from various foreign news agencies, 12,000 tugboat and barge sailors in Shanghai began a strike on June 28th to demand wage increases. On the second day, dockworkers in the city also launched a strike in support. On that day, six ships had ceased operations, including at least two American ships, the \"Rogers Mountain\" and the \"Klondike.\" As the management was forced to agree to the workers' demands for wage increases, the sailors and dockworkers resumed work on the 2nd. The strike of 2,000 Jianghai Customs employees, which began on June 18th, still had half of the employees not returning to work by the fourth day. Their demands were to restore the \"Welfare Association\" formed by the employees that had been unreasonably dissolved and to improve their treatment. According to a special dispatch from Guangzhou in the Tianjin Republican Daily on June 3rd, workers in various industries in Guangzhou had also demanded \"payment in rice\" to increase their compensation due to soaring prices, and strike incidents occurred frequently. Labor disputes in the sewing, hotel, tea shop, flour, and rice milling industries have not yet been resolved.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to delayed Tianjin newspaper reports, disturbances and strikes broke out in Guangfeng, Yushan, and Shangrao in eastern Jiangxi to protest the rape of women by Chiang Kai-shek troops. In early May, a tragic incident occurred in Guangfeng County in which wounded Chiang Kai-shek soldiers gang-raped a female student from the Mi Jia Ling area, resulting in her death. After the atrocity, the local people were extremely angry. On the night of the 8th, more than a hundred enraged people gathered to attack the barracks of the \"Veterans' Recuperation Institute\" five miles from the city, capturing five Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, forcing the personnel of the institute to flee to the city in panic. When news of the Chiang Kai-shek troops' atrocities spread to the city, merchants and residents throughout the city also went on strike on the 10th to protest. An atrocity incident by Chiang Kai-shek troops also occurred near Zaotou Town in Shangrao County. On the morning of the 13th, six wounded Chiang Kai-shek soldiers raped a tea-picking girl until she was on the verge of death. Upon hearing the news, the villagers were greatly angered. With the sound of gongs, more than a dozen villagers chased and grabbed the wounded soldiers who had raped the girl and beat them. Afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek troops attempted to retaliate and committed atrocities everywhere. At 12:00 on the morning of the 17th, dozens of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, without asking any questions, beat three farmers working in the fields to death with clubs, further enraging the villagers. Furthermore, on May 17th, two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers broke into the Ping Shurong family's room in the Tianran Hotel in Yushan City and attempted rape. Upon hearing the news, Ping was extremely indignant and immediately gathered four armed guards to return to the hotel and fire warning shots at the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. At this time, all the wounded soldiers in the city gathered and surrounded the hotel, wielding weapons and beating anyone they saw, causing an uproar throughout the city. Merchants and residents immediately went on strike to protest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海万余水手罢工获胜　广丰等县商民罢市抗议蒋军强奸暴行\n\n1948-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海万余水手罢工获胜\n    广丰等县商民罢市抗议蒋军强奸暴行\n    【新华社陕北四日电】据各外国通讯社报导，上海拖船及驳船水手一万二千人，为要求增加工资，于六月廿八日起开始罢工。至第二日，该市码头工人亦已发动罢工，以为声援。当日已有六艘轮船停航，其中至少包括两艘美轮，即“罗吉尔斯山号”与“开采热潮号”。由于资方已被迫答应工人增资要求，水手及码头工人已于二日复工。江海关职员两千人于六月十八日开始的罢工，至第四日，仍有半数未复工。他们提出的要求是恢复已被无理解散的为职员所组成的“福利协会”和改善待遇。据天津民国日报六月三日广州专电：广州各业工人亦因物价飞涨，曾要求“以米折薪”提高待遇，罢工事件迭起，缝工、旅店、茶店、面粉、碾谷等业劳资纠纷迄未解决。\n    【新华社陕北六日电】据迟到的津报消息：江西东部的广丰、玉山、上饶相继爆发抗议蒋军强奸妇女暴行的骚动及罢市。广丰县于五月上旬发生蒋军伤兵轮奸该县米家岭女学生毙命惨案，暴行发生后，当地人民均愤怒万分。八日深夜，一百多个激怒的群众集合起来，袭击距城五里的“荣军教养院”营房，捉去蒋军五人，迫使该院人员狼狈逃往城内。蒋军暴行消息传至城内后，全城商民亦于十日全体罢市抗议。上饶县皂头镇附近亦发生蒋军暴行事件，十三日上午蒋军伤兵六人将一采茶少女强暴轮奸，直到该少女奄奄一息。村民闻讯大愤，锣声一响，十余村民追去扭住奸淫少女的伤兵就打。事后蒋军企图报复，四出行凶，十七日上午十二时，蒋军数十人，不问情由，即把在田里工作的三个农民用乱棍打死，乡民群情更为激愤。又蒋军二人于五月十七日闯入玉山城城内的天然旅馆老板平树荣眷属房内企图强奸，平闻讯愤极，当纠集枪丁四名返馆内向蒋军鸣枪警告，此时全市伤兵竟全体集合将该旅馆包围，手执凶器，见人即行殴砍，全城哗然。商民当即全体罢市抗议。"

Comprehensive foreign news agency reports: After the private primary school teachers in Shanghai sent about 200 representatives to the Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Council on June 26th to petition without result, the private secondary school teachers also joined this anti-hunger struggle. On the 28th, they jointly sent about 700 representatives (according to TASS) to surround the Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Government's Education Bureau to petition, demanding the immediate implementation of the reasonable demands of issuing 10 million yuan in relief money to each teacher and allocating three \"dou\" of rice per month according to the treatment of public school teachers. Because they did not receive a reply, they collectively slept in front of the Education Bureau that night, and they still did not disperse in the heavy rain on the 29th. According to Reuters: The struggle of private primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai has gained the support of teachers and students from many schools. The Student Union of Jiaotong University sent them a banner with the words \"Perseverance Will Surely Lead to Victory.\" The protesting teachers and the students who came to express their sympathy chanted slogans such as \"We want food!\" and sang patriotic and anti-hunger songs together. They also posted tragic anti-hunger slogans all over the Education Bureau's entrance, which was \"heavily guarded.\" Due to the resolute struggle of private primary and secondary school teachers in the city, the Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Government Education Bureau has been forced to agree to advance 5 million yuan to each person.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海私立中小学教师　反饥饿斗争扩大\n\n1948-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海私立中小学教师\n    反饥饿斗争扩大\n    【新华社陕北四日电】综合外国通讯社消息：上海全市私立小学教师曾于六月廿六日推派代表约二百人赴蒋记市参议会请愿未得结果后，各私立中学教员亦参加此一反饥饿斗争，于廿八日联合推派代表约七百人（据塔斯社），包围蒋记市府教育局请愿，要求立即实现每一教师发给一千万元之救济金，及每月按照公教人员待遇配给大米三斗的合理要求，因未获得答复，当夜他们就集体的露宿在教育局门口，二十九日大雨中他们仍不散去。据路透社报导：沪市私立中小学教师的斗争，获得许多学校师生的支持。交通大学学生自治会送给他们一幅写有“不屈不挠必获胜利”的旗帜，示威的教师和前往慰问的学生一起高呼“我们要饭吃”等口号，合唱爱国与反饥饿的歌曲，并在“警备森严”的教育局门口上贴满反饥饿的悲壮标语。由于全市私立中小学教师的坚决力争，上海蒋记市政府教育局已被迫答应预支每人五百万元。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-07",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: Although this report by Thorez is eight or nine months old, it remains an important material for understanding the current political situation in France, especially the political line and lessons of the French Communist Party since World War II. It is published for readers in various regions to study international issues and the tactics in the united front.\n\n　　　　The Communist Party is Still the Largest Party\nOur Party has every reason to be proud and to face the future with confidence, because despite de Gaulle's exemplary anti-communist movement, and the fact that all other parties, from the Socialist Party to the most despicable reactionaries, have included anti-communism in their platforms, and despite the arbitrary election laws that are unfavorable to us and allow the Socialist Party and the de Gaulle faction to collude in the appointment of municipal organs, we have still won the strong support of one-third of the men and women of France.\n\nOfficial statistics, as usual, distort the elections to favor the reactionaries, but the result is that we are still the largest party.\n\nIn towns with more than 9,000 people, the number of seats won is as follows:\n\tParty\t\t\t\tNumber of Seats\t\t\tPercentage\n\tCommunist Party\t\t\t3,993\t\t\t\t30.64\n\tSocialist Party\t\t\t2,107\t\t\t\t16.12\n\tRadical Party\t\t\t531\n\tPopular Republican Movement\t1,682\t\t\t\t12.91\n\tDe Gaulle faction\t\t3,762\t\t\t\t28.86\n\tRepublican Liberty Party\t257\n\nIn these towns, our vote rate reached 30 percent. In medium-sized areas, the rate is not low, and there has generally been some progress in these areas.\n\nSince the liberation of France, our progress has been continuous. 26 percent in October 1945; 26.2 percent in June 1946; 28.6 percent in October 1946; and 29.2 percent in November 1946.\n\nDe Gaulle boasted that he would give our Communist Party a major blow. This little dictator rightly sees our Party as the main obstacle to his establishment of personal power. But the election results show that the efforts of all our enemies have failed to weaken the strong position of our Communist Party. Our Party is deeply rooted in our country. There have been local setbacks, and we will examine the reasons for them, but in many places, we have made new gains. On a national scale, we have done more than just maintain our original position.\n\n　　　　Wall Street and France\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, recently said that it is necessary to intensify what he calls \"the struggle for France.\" American capitalists are trying to enslave our country, they want to end our economic and political independence, to end our national sovereignty, and they want to turn our country into a semi-colony, like Portugal or Chile.\n\nThe American plan to give priority to the restoration of German industry is completely contrary to the interests of France. The Brown report (Note: Advisor to General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Germany) aims to completely deprive us of coal from the Ruhr, which is the inevitable result of the surrender policies successively adopted by Léon Blum and Bidault on the issue of reparations and coal.\n\nIt is now clear that the British and American governments, which prevent us from obtaining German coal through reparations, have only one purpose: to make us dependent on them. They are hindering our recovery. They do not want a strong, prosperous France that can resist their pressure, either in the past or now. They do not tolerate a highly industrialized France with high steel production. These productions are the guarantee of our economic and political independence.\n\n　　　　The Colonialization of the French Economy\nWhat the United States needs is to eliminate some of our industries, or to control them to obtain profits.\n\nFord and General Motors are trying to gain control of our automobile industry. Through its connection with International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (another American trust), the American trust Thomson-Houston Alstom has become the boss of our production of electrical and telephone equipment. American banks have significant shares in many French enterprises.\n\nThe situation is the same in our overseas territories. American shares account for a significant portion of companies in Guinea, Togo (both on the Atlantic coast of French West Africa), Guyana (on the northeast Atlantic coast of South America), and Madagascar (in the Indian Ocean southeast of Africa).\n\nThe French aircraft manufacturing industry has been sacrificed. Contrary to the selfish assertions slandered by the reactionaries, all aircraft manufacturing companies in the country, except for one, have lost money. The French government has not repaid the 9 billion francs owed to them, which has put them in difficulty.\n\nAmerican financiers are naturally interested in French overseas territories. They are determined to seize the sources of those raw materials. They want to open up the markets of North Africa and Vietnam to increase their exports.\n\nAt our Party's Tenth National Congress, we formulated a plan to develop power, coal and electricity resources. The \"Monnet Plan\" specifically stipulates the necessary investment to renovate and modernize the machinery and equipment of our coal mines and to build large hydropower stations. The Americans are now about to invest the first 30 billion francs of capital in the Ruhr coal mines, thus eliminating the Monnet Plan.\n\nOur coal, electricity, and gas companies have to wait for the (American) capitalists to be happy before they can continue to operate.\n\nThe same is true for construction. While many people are waiting for houses to live in, land is left vacant, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. In September of this year, 27 medium-sized construction companies had to close down. The whole of France, from Dunkirk to Marseille, from Brest to Strasbourg, is a scene of ruins and rubble. \"French films are in trouble, they will soon be finished.\" Dr. Mabire-Barnor of the Institute warned. This is the sad result of the Blum-Byrnes agreement. L'Humanité published figures showing the re-destruction of our industry and the victory of American competitors: In the first half of 1946, 38 American films and 35 French films obtained permits, in the second half the figures were 145 and 46, and in the first half of 1947 they were 338 and 35.\n\nBut the problem is not just that the Americans are making a lot of money, and the poverty and unemployment of workers, musicians, and artists working in the French film industry. We must see another side to this fact, namely the ideological preparation that the United States is carrying out on the French people it is trying to enslave. This is a measure to disintegrate the French nation. This is a way for the United States to try to corrupt and seduce French youth through these films. Because in American films, it is either love or superstition, or robbers becoming emperors. These films cannot help cultivate a generation of French citizens who understand their responsibilities to France and the Republic, but can only cultivate a group of slaves who kowtow under oppression. How can the United States make good films when many of the best artists are oppressed for being accused of being communist sympathizers?\n\nAs for the essence of American expansionist economics, it is inevitably supplemented by the establishment of military and strategic bases in countries under the control of the Gold Standard imperialism. On September 9, 1947, Le Figaro (Note: de Gaulle's newspaper - editor) unreservedly admitted: \"Because France is at the tip of Western Europe, close to England, and because she owns land in Africa, she is within the American security zone.\"\n\n　　　　American Interference in Our Internal Affairs\nThe United States is fiercely interfering in our internal affairs. American rulers and other congressmen, all merchants and tourists who trade in corned beef and chewing gum, simply do not hide this point. They arrogantly give orders. American imperialism supports all the reactionary forces in France. The American New York Post wrote: \"De Gaulle is using our anti-communist fever, hoping to rely on this to get our help, just like we give help to the reactionaries in China and Greece. We have reached such a situation that only those who are furthest away from the interests of their own people welcome our interference.\"\n\nThe United States has spent millions of dollars trying to give the French General Confederation of Labor a blow. They have set up offices in Paris, specializing in organizing the struggle against the French General Confederation of Labor. In this regard, the United States is using some Socialist Party leaders, who have done their best to split the trade union organizations of the post office, the Paris transport industry, and other enterprises.\n\n　　　　Léon Blum is a Supporter of American Imperialism\nIt is obvious that the American plan to enslave our country would not have succeeded without the support of the Socialist Party leaders, especially Léon Blum and Ramadier. American imperialism and the \"Marshall Plan\": \"France has no better supporter than Léon Blum. He not only pushed France down this unfortunate road in negotiations with the United States and Britain in Washington and London, but he also tried his best to satisfy the cruel demands of American policy, which appeared generous and unambitious. He is the only person in France who dares to say that American capitalists do not need to export. This attitude did not prevent him from facilitating the screening of American films in France, nor did it prevent him from helping the United States to replace Ruhr coal with its expensive coal. And the Ruhr coal was precisely what he (Blum) gave up. We said at our Party's Eleventh National Congress: Blum \"idealizes the expansion policy of American monopoly capitalists, the result of which can only be to disarm the French working class and the people ideologically and politically, so that they cannot resist the infringement of international financial forces that endanger our national independence.\"\n\nLéon Blum believes that the term \"national sovereignty\" is a \"nationalist term,\" and that this concept is outdated. He put forward his theory of \"supranational international communes\" to oppose national sovereignty. He wants to blur the understanding of workers who believe in internationalism. He disguises his abandonment of independence and national sovereignty with democracy and progress, which only benefits American imperialism. However, workers will not confuse proletarian internationalism with the globalism of trusts.\n\n　　　　Blum and Mollet are Against the Soviet Union and Against Peace\nLéon Blum and Guy Mollet (Note: Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party - editor) have always been sophists who deceive the working class and those who truly love peace. Workers and peace-loving people criticize the aggressive aims of the imperialist camp and oppose the danger of war. They also believe that these are threats to the whole world. The Socialist Party leaders say that this is to agree to divide the world into two, to recognize that conflict is inevitable, and to accept war.\n\nThe Socialist Party leaders stubbornly say two blocs, the purpose of which is only to try to obscure the masses' correct understanding of the real situation. It should be noted that the imperialist camp has been formed under the guidance of the United States for the benefit of the United States. Blum and de Gaulle want to put France in this imperialist camp. As for the opposing camp, it is not a group of several countries, but a great unity of all the working-class democratic and anti-imperialist forces in the world, fighting for freedom and peace. This anti-imperialist camp has the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries as its strong foundation.\n\n　　　　\"The Third Force\" is to Split the Working Class\nThe Socialist Party leaders play the role of the \"third force.\" Some people may ask, isn't it important to unite all workers and all Republicans to prevent de Gaulleism, and to unite them into a single force against the reactionaries and imperialist war?\n\nIn reality, \"the third force\" means splitting the working class and helping the reactionaries. Isn't it noteworthy that the extreme left-wing Mollet, the ultra-left-wing Biver, this authentic Trotskyist agitator, has become the vanguard of the Socialist Party and the reactionaries' united activities against the towns dominated by the Communist Party? The Socialist Party leaders collude to support the de Gaulle faction. They are either elected by accepting the support of the reactionaries, or they help the reactionaries to be elected.\n\nObviously, we cannot unite all workers and Republicans to fight against imperialism and its running dogs and win victory unless we severely criticize the Socialist Party leaders. The Socialist Party leaders play the role of accomplices and executors in the US policy of enslaving our country. This policy as a whole is against the working masses and only benefits international reactionaries.\n\nOur sacred task of the French Communist Party is to hold high the banner of fighting for national independence and sovereignty more firmly than ever before.\n\nWe have shown that our Communist Party, this French political party, is indeed capable of uniting and organizing all the forces in France who are determined to defend national glory and independence to fight against the forces of oppression. (To be continued)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保卫共和——捍卫我们的民族独立（法共总书记多列士于一九四七年十月二十九日对法共中央委员会的报告节要）\n\n1948-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　保卫共和——捍卫我们的民族独立\n    （法共总书记多列士于一九四七年十月二十九日对法共中央委员会的报告节要）\n    新华社编者按：多烈士的这篇报告，时间距现在虽已有八九个月，但仍是了解法国目前政局特别是了解法共在第二次世界大战以来政治路线及其教训的重要材料，特为发表，以供各地读者研究国际问题和统一战线中的策略问题之参考。\n    　　　　共产党还是第一大政党\n    我们的党完全有理由可以自豪，并且可以充满着信心面向将来，因为尽管戴高乐以身作则进行了猛烈的反共运动，以及一切其他政党，从社会党到最卑劣的反动派，都把反共列入政纲，尽管独断的选举法对我们不利，而使社会党和戴高乐派在任命市政机关时，得以狼狈为奸，我们还是获得了全法国男女人民中三分之一的坚强支持。\n    官方统计照例对选举作对反动派有利的歪曲报导，但是结果我们还是第一大党。\n    在有九千人以上的市镇中，当选席数如下：政党　　　　　　　席数　　　　　　　　　　　　百分比共产党　　　　　三、九九三　　\n　　　　　　　三○点六四社会党　　　　　二、一○七　　　　　　\n　　　一六点一二急进党　　　　　五三一人民共和党　　　一、六八二　　　　　　　　一二点九一戴高乐派　　　三、七六二　　　　　\n　　　　二八点八六自由共和党　　二五七\n    在这些市镇，我们的选票比率达百分之三十。在中等地区，比率也不低，大体上在这些地区还有若干进步。\n    法国解放以来，我们的进步是不断的。一九四五年十月占百分之二十六；一九四六年六月百分之二十六点二；一九四六年十月百分之二十八点六；一九四六年十一月百分之二十九点二。\n    戴高乐吹牛说：他要给我们共产党一个重大打击，这位小独裁者把我们党看做他建立个人权力的主要障碍，是有道理的。但是选举的结果，表现我们的所有的敌人们的努力，都没有能够削弱我们共产党的坚强地位。我们的党在我国是根深蒂固的。地方性的挫折是有的，我们将检讨其原因，但是在许多地方，我们有了新的收获。以全国而论，我们不止维持了原有的地位而已。\n    　　　　华尔街和法国\n    前美国驻法大使布立特最近说，加紧他称为“争取法国的斗争”，是必要的，美国的大资本家正想奴役我国，他们要结束我们的经济和政治的独立，要结束我们国家的主权，他们要把我国变成半殖民地，象葡萄牙或智利一样。\n    美国计划优先恢复德国工业，这是和法国的利益完全相违背的。布朗（按为德境美军司令克莱的顾问）报告以完全剥夺我们从鲁尔取得煤为目的，这是莱翁·勃鲁姆和比道尔对赔偿和煤的问题先后采取了投降政策的必然结果。\n    现在很清楚，不使我们经过赔偿以获得德国煤的英美政府，其唯一的目的，就是叫我们依赖他们，他们阻碍了我们的复兴，他们在以前和现在都不要有一个能够抵抗他们压力的、强大的、繁荣的法国，他们不容忍一个高度工业化的、钢铁生产很高的法国，这些生产正是我们经济和政治上独立的保障。\n    　　　　法国经济的殖民地化\n    美国所需要的是消灭我们的若干工业，或加以控制获得利润。\n    福特和通用汽车公司正设法取得对我国汽车工业的控制，美国的托拉斯，汤姆生——胡斯顿·阿尔斯多姆通过国际电话电报公司（这是另一美国托拉斯）之联系，成了我国电机和电话设备的生产老板。美国银行在许多法国企业中有重要的股份。\n    在我国海外地区中，情形也一样，在几内亚、多哥（按上两地在法属西非大西洋岸）、圭亚那（按在南美东北大西洋岸）和马达加斯加（按在非洲东南印度洋）的若干公司中，美国股份占了重要部分。\n    法国飞机制造业是被牺牲了。和反动派所污蔑的、自私的断言相反，全国所有制造飞机的公司，除一家外，都赔了钱。法国政府不将所欠的九十亿法郎还给他们，使他们遇到了困难。\n    美国金融界自然对法国海外地区表示兴趣，他们决心攫取那些原料的来源，他们要北非和越南的市场开放，增加他们的输出。\n    在我们党第十次全国代表大会，我们拟定了发展动力、煤和电力资源的计划。“孟纳计划”具体规定了使我国煤矿的机器及设备革新与现代化，及建设大水电站的必要的投资数目。美国人却正要对鲁尔煤矿投入第一笔资本的三百亿法郎，这样他们就消除了孟纳计划。\n    我国煤矿电力和煤气公司，不得不等待（美国）资本家们高兴时才能工作下去。\n    建设事业也一样，当许多人都在等着房子住的时候，地皮却空在那里，失业的人一天天增加，今年九月，二十七家中等建筑公司不得不关门。整个法国从敦刻尔克到马赛、从布勒斯特到斯特拉斯堡，一片废墟瓦砾。“法国电影不得了，不久就要完蛋了。”研究院的马宾·巴诺尔博士这样警告着。这是勃鲁姆——贝纳斯协定的可悲结果。人道报发表数字，显示我国工业的再次破坏和美国竞争者们的胜利：一九四六年上半年，三十八部美国电影，三十五部法国电影取得检讫准演执照，下半年中数字是一百四十五部和四十六部，而一九四七年上半年则是三百三十八部和卅五部。\n    但是问题还不止是美国人赚了许多钱，而法国电影业中工作的工人、音乐师和艺术家的贫困和失业而已。我们必须在这件事实中，看到另一面，即美国对她企图奴役的法国人民所进行的思想准备。这是瓦解法兰西民族的一项措施，这是美国企图经过这些影片，来腐化和诱惑法国青年的一种办法。因为在美国电影中，不是恋爱就是迷信，再不就是强盗当皇帝。这些影片，不能帮助培养一代懂得自己对法国对共和国的责任的法国公民，而只能培养出一批在压迫之下叩头的奴隶。当许多最优秀的艺术家，被控为共产党的同情者而遭受压迫时，美国怎么制造得出好影片来呢？\n    论到美国扩张主义经济的实质，乃不可避免的辅之以在金元帝国主义控制下的国家中，实现建立起军事的和战略的基地。一九四七年九月九日费加罗报（按为戴高乐的报纸——编者）毫不掩饰地承认：“因为法国处在西欧的尖端，靠近英国，并因为她在非洲拥有土地，她就处在美国安全区域之内”。\n    　　　　美国干涉我们的内政\n    美国正凶猛的干涉我们的内政。美国统治者及其他国会议员、所有作腌牛肉和口香糖生意的商人和游客们，干脆毫不掩饰这点。他们傲慢地下命令。美帝国主义支持着法国的一切反动势力，美国的纽约邮报写道：“戴高乐利用我们的反共热，希望这样就靠得住得到我们对他的帮助，好象我们给中国和希腊反动派帮助一样。我们已经到了这样的情形，只有那些和他们本国人民的利益离得最远的人们才欢迎我们的干涉”。\n    美国花了千百万美元，企图借此给法国总工会一个打击。他们在巴黎设立了办事处，专门负责组织反对法国总工会的斗争。在这方面，美国正利用若干社会党领袖，他们已经尽力分裂邮政、巴黎运输业及其他企业的工会组织。\n    　　　　莱翁·勃鲁姆是美帝国主义的拥护者\n    如果不是社会党领袖，特别是莱翁·勃鲁姆和拉马第，给以支持，美国奴役我国的计划便没有成功的机会，这是明显的。美帝国主义和“马歇尔计划”“法国再没有比莱翁·勃鲁姆更好的拥护者了。他不仅在华盛顿和伦敦与美英办交涉中把法国推进这条倒霉的道路，并且他还尽力满足以慷慨、无野心姿态出现的美国政策的残酷要求。法国只有他一个人敢说美国资本家用不着输出。他的这种态度，却并没有阻止他不给美国影片在法国放映以方便，也没有阻止他帮助美国以其价格高昂的煤代替鲁尔的煤。而鲁尔的煤正是他（勃鲁姆）放弃了的。我们在我党十一次全国代表大会上说：勃鲁姆“把美国独占资本家的扩张政策理想化，其结果只能是在思想上和政治上，解除法国工人阶级及人民的武装，使其不能抵抗那种危害我们民族独立的国际金融势力之侵害”。\n    莱翁·勃鲁姆认为“国家主权”的名词是“国家主义的名词”，他认为这个概念已经过时了。他提出了他的“超主权的国际公社”的理论，来反对国家主权。他想模糊信仰国际主义的工人的认识，他以伪装的民主和进步，掩饰其放弃独立和国家主权，这只对美帝国主义有好处。然而，工人是不会把无产阶级的国际主义和托拉斯的全球主义混淆起来的。\n    　　　　勃鲁姆和摩勒是反对苏联、反对和平的\n    莱翁·勃鲁姆和盖·摩勒（按为法社会党总书记——编者）一向是欺骗工人阶级和真正爱好和平的人们的诡辩老手。工人和爱好和平的人们，抨击帝国主义营垒的侵略的目的，反对战争危险，他们又认为这些是对整个世界的威胁。社会党领袖却说，这就是同意把世界分裂为二，承认冲突不可避免，接受战争。\n    社会党领袖顽固地说两个集团，其目的只有企图模糊群众对真实情形的正确的认识。须知帝国主义营垒已经在美国的指导之下，为了美国的利益而形成了。勃鲁姆和戴高乐要把法国放在这个帝国主义营垒之内。至于与此相反的营垒，那不是若干国家的集团，而是全世界所有的工人阶级民主的反帝国主义的力量的大团结，是为自由与和平而奋斗的。这个反帝国主义的营垒，是以苏联和新民主主义国家为其强有力的基础的。\n    　　　　“第三种力量”就是分裂工人阶级\n    社会党领袖担任“第三种力量”的角色，有人会问为了阻止戴高乐主义而做到团结一切工人和一切共和分子，把他们团结成为一个单一的力量，反对反动派和帝国主义战争，难道不重要吗？\n    实际上，“第三种力量”意思就是分裂工人阶级和帮助反动派。极左派摩勒、超左派比佛，这种道地的托洛茨基派煽动家，成了社会党及反动派联合起来反对共产党占优势的市镇的活动的先锋，该是值得注意的吧？社会党的领袖而狼狈为奸地支持戴高乐派，他们不是接受反动派的支持而当选，就是帮助反动派当选。\n    显然的，我们若不严厉斥责社会党领袖，就不能团结一切工人和共和分子进行反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，并获得胜利。社会党领袖对美国奴役我国的政策起着共谋与执行者的作用。这政策整个是反对劳动群众而只是对国际反动派有利的。\n    我们法国共产党的神圣任务，是要比任何时候更坚定的、高举为民族独立和主权而斗争的旗帜。\n    我们已经表现出我们的共产党，这个法兰西政党，是的确能够团结、和组织领导法国一切决心保卫民族光荣独立的力量来与压迫势力进行斗争的。（未完）"

It pointed out: (1) Continue planting after wheat harvest, replant autumn seedlings, eliminate cultivated wasteland, and strive to plant more and harvest more. For farmers who do not seize the opportunity to plant despite timely rainfall, we should educate and urge them to plant quickly. For wheat fields that are left fallow, we should call on the masses to plow quickly to facilitate planting crops and wheat. For areas with mole crickets and semi-alkaline soil, continuous replanting should be carried out. For wasteland that has been barren for many years, we should organize the masses to cultivate it, or plant alfalfa, trees, etc., to increase production and improve the soil. (2) Call on the masses to practice intensive and careful farming to increase production. We should use agricultural proverbs such as \"One inch of weeding is better than fertilizer, and a good harvest fills the granary,\" \"Weed rice four times and get good rice, weed cotton eight times and get good clothes,\" and \"The hoe has water\" to educate the masses, increase their enthusiasm for production, and increase yields. (3) Call on the masses to accumulate fertilizer and apply top dressing: \"Compost several circles of fertilizer in the summer, and next year the wheat will fill the granary.\" We should mobilize the masses to seize the opportunity to accumulate night soil; and promote raising more livestock, breeding livestock, raising pigs, and extracting oil to greatly increase fertilizer production, which will immediately increase yields. Autumn seedlings that have not been fertilized or have received little fertilizer should be top-dressed in a timely manner to increase the autumn harvest. (4) Pay attention to pest prevention at all times: Recently, dense insects, locust nymphs, mole crickets, big-eyed bugs, etc., have occurred frequently in various places, causing great harm; cadres at all levels should work with the masses to study pest control methods and promote them well. In the future, if pests are found, immediately mobilize the masses to quickly capture and kill them. In order to complete the above calls and carry out the production movement, the following points must be noted: (1) Conscientiously implement the various policies of the higher levels, correct deviations, solve various difficulties in production, eliminate ideological obstacles in production, and improve the mood for production. (2) Widely publicize this year's burden method, explaining that whoever plants gets the harvest, cultivated wasteland is exempt from burden for one year, and barren wasteland is exempt from burden for three years; agricultural burdens are generally levied according to the standard yield per mu, without progressive increases. And we must do a good job in rationalizing wartime labor, reducing unnecessary burdens on the masses, and enabling the masses to invest heavily in production. (3) Vigorously organize mass production mutual aid to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power, but we must ensure democratic voluntarism and equivalent exchange, and prevent coercion, commandism, and formalism.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南行署指示夏季生产　灭荒防虫精耕细作\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南行署指示夏季生产\n    灭荒防虫精耕细作\n    【冀南讯】冀南行署发出夏季生产指示。指出：（一）继续种麦茬，补种秋苗，消灭熟荒，争取多种多收。对于雨水及时但不抓紧种地的农民，我们应教育督促其很快种上。对留麦地，应号召群众快耕，以利种地种麦。对有蝼蛄和半沙碱地，应连续的补种。对很多年的荒地，要组织群众耕种，或种苜蓿、树林等，以增加生产改良土壤。（二）号召群众精耕细作，增加生产。应以：“苗锄一寸顶上粪，粮食丰收满仓囤”，“谷锄四遍二八米，棉锄八遍好织褂”，“锄头有水”等农谚教育群众，提高生产积极性，增加收成。（三）号召群众积肥、上追肥，“伏里沤上几圈粪，明年麦子收满囤”。应发动群众抓紧时机多沤圊肥；并提倡多喂牲口，繁殖牲畜，养猪，打油，大量增加肥料，上即增收。没上粪或上的少的秋苗地，应及时上追肥，以增秋收。（四）随时注意防虫：近来各地不断发生密虫，蝗蝻，蝼蛄，大眼贼等，为害很大；各级干部应结合群众，很好研究灭虫办法，很好推广。今后如发现害虫，立即动员群众迅速捕灭。为了完成上述号召，开展生产运动，必须注意以下几点：（一）认真贯彻上级各项政策，纠正偏向，解决生产中的各种困难，消除生产中的思想障碍，提高生产情绪。（二）广泛宣传今年负担办法，说明谁种谁收，开熟荒一年不纳负担，生荒三年不纳负担；农业负担，一般按标准亩常年产量征收，不加累进。并且要很好做到战勤合理，减少群众不必要的负担，使群众大力投入生产。（三）大力组织群众生产互助，解决人畜力的困难，但必须做到民主自愿等价交换，防止强迫命令“轰轰烈烈”的形式主义。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 29th: Commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army are universally visiting the people of southwestern Shandong who have suffered deeply from Chiang's disasters. Each time they arrive at an encampment after marching, the soldiers investigate the enemy's atrocities and the enemy army's internal decadence and panic. The mass work team of the soldiers' committee of a certain unit often interviews until dawn without resting. A certain unit, in groups of squads, sends condolences to the suffering masses; and reports the materials obtained from the visits that day to everyone during the troop assembly, and then conducts informal discussions in each squad. All units hold large-scale accusation meetings, where the masses accuse the bandit troops of their atrocities to the troops. At these meetings, many newly enlisted soldiers also angrily stood up to accuse their families of the past suffering from Chiang's bandit persecution. This kind of accusation has become a very vivid and profound form of education and combat mobilization in the army, strengthening the soldiers' determination to avenge the people, and thus further consolidating the army. After listening to the accusations of the masses, many cadres and fighters were determined to abandon any personal plans and devote themselves to killing the enemy and making meritorious services to eliminate harm for the people. At the general meeting of the second battalion of a certain unit, the masses of a certain village were invited to accuse the bandit 5th Reorganized Army of its crimes. Sixty-eight of the seventy young men in the village were captured by the 5th Reorganized Army, and the men were killed. The women in the village were gathered together by the bandit army, and three were assigned to each squad for the bandit army to take turns raping. An old woman and her daughter-in-law talked about the tragic situation of their son and husband being killed by the bandit 5th Reorganized Army and their food being robbed. They covered their faces and cried, begging the People's Liberation Army to eliminate the bandit and avenge them. The soldiers were infuriated by this tragic scene. One soldier trembled with anger and stood up and shouted, \"Comrades! What are our guns for?!\" The whole audience immediately answered like thunder: \"Our guns are for avenging the people and eliminating harm!\" At this time, it was raining heavily, but the soldiers still stood still, completely soaked. Everyone vowed to eliminate the bandit 5th Reorganized Army and avenge the fathers and sisters of southwestern Shandong. After the meeting, many soldiers comforted the village cadres and the masses. Back in the company, everyone sharpened their knives and wiped their guns, preparing for battle. When a certain unit was gathering, the masses came to complain to the troops. An old woman cried without opening her mouth, and only said: \"We kowtow to you comrades, you must avenge us!\" It turned out that her only son was cut off his feet by the bandit 5th Army and then stabbed to death with bayonets, and everything in the family was robbed. She bought two packs of cigarettes to comfort them, she said: \"There is nothing left in our house, these two packs of cigarettes express our feelings, comrades, you must avenge us!\" The soldiers were saddened to tears, and the whole audience angrily shouted in unison: \"Resolutely eliminate the bandit 5th Army, avenge the people of southwestern Shandong and eliminate harm!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东我军访苦　鲁西南受灾人民控诉匪五军罪行\n\n1948-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华东我军访苦\n    鲁西南受灾人民控诉匪五军罪行\n    【新华社中原前线廿九日电】华东人民解放军某部指战员，普遍向深受蒋灾的鲁西南人民进行访苦。每次行军到达宿营地后，战士们就向群众调查敌军暴行和敌军内部颓丧恐慌情形。某部士兵委员会群众工作组，常常访问到天明还不休息。某部以班为单位，慰问受难群众；并在部队集合时向大家报告当天访苦所得的材料，再在各班展开漫谈讨论。各部都召开大型的控诉会，由群众向部队控诉匪军们的暴行。许多新参军战士在这种会上，也激愤地起而控诉自己家中过去遭受蒋匪残害的情形。这种控诉已成为部队中一种极生动深刻的教育方式与战斗动员方式、加强了战士为人民复仇的决心，并因此而更加巩固了部队。许多干部战士听了群众控诉后，决心放弃任何个人打算，全力杀敌立功，为民除害。某部第二营全体大会上，邀集某村群众控诉匪整五军罪行，该村七十个青壮年被整五军抓走了六十八名，男人被杀。村中妇女被匪军集中起来，每班分配三个供匪军轮奸。一位老大娘和她媳妇谈起她们的儿夫被匪整五军杀死，粮食被抢光的那种惨状时，掩面痛哭，泣求解放军消灭该匪为她们报仇除害。战士们为这种凄惨情景而激怒万分，一个战士气得浑身发抖站起来大叫道：“同志们！我们的枪是干什么的啊？！”全场立即雷动似的回答道：“我们的枪是为人民复仇除害的！”这时适下大雨，战士们虽全身湿透，但仍立着不动，大家发誓要消灭匪整五军，为鲁西南父老姐妹复仇。散会后，许多战士向村干部和群众进行安慰，回到连里大家纷纷磨刀擦枪，准备战斗。某部正集会时，群众来向部队诉苦，一位老大娘没开口就大哭，只是说：“咱给同志们拜一拜，你们要给咱报仇呀！”原来她的独生子被匪五军砍断两脚再用刺刀戳死了，家里什么都抢光了。她买了两包香烟来慰劳，她说：“咱家里啥也没有了，这两包烟表表咱的心意，同志们，要给咱们报仇啊！”战士们难过得流泪，全场一致愤怒的高呼：“坚决消灭匪五军，为鲁西南的人民复仇除害！”"

    "content": "【JiZhong News】 Shen County's Advancement Society convened a meeting of agricultural loan cadres and branch society directors on June 5th to review and summarize loan work, and discuss the focus of future loan inspection and usage. From March 25th to May 29th, the county issued a total of 1,140,590,000 yuan in loans (border region currency), reaching 207 impoverished villages, including 406 middle peasant households and 3,053 poor peasant households. Among these, agricultural loans amounted to 779,570,000 yuan, accounting for 68.35% of the total loans, driving private investment of 21,034,000 yuan. This facilitated the purchase of 382 head of livestock, 1,456 pieces of farm equipment (including plows, harrows, carts, hoes, etc.), as well as fertilizers and seeds. Sideline loans totaled 191,450,000 yuan, accounting for 16.8% of the total loans, driving private investment of 6,309,000 yuan, supporting 15 lumber mills, 13 cotton ginning groups, 3 oil mills, 3 paper mills, and 82 weaving groups. The oil pressing group in Nanshao Village, Fifth District, originally had 14 shares, each worth 200,000 yuan. The Advancement Society loaned them 6,000,000 yuan. The group, with women shelling peanuts and watching the millstones, and men doing heavy work, earned 7,000,000 yuan in 20 days. Water conservancy loans totaled 169,560,000 yuan, accounting for 14.85% of the total loans, driving private investment of 10,385,000 yuan, enabling the digging of 10 foreign-style wells, the purchase of 59 waterwheels, the repair of 4 old waterwheels, and the purchase of 224 water buckets. Loan inspection work has become more thorough than before, with inspections conducted concurrently with loans, extensive visits, physical verification, and mobilization of the masses for mutual inspection, yielding good results. While the county's loan work has achieved the above results, some deviations have also occurred. In some districts, the work was not thorough, vacillating back and forth, and the mass line was not well implemented; some borrowers took the opportunity to engage in mischief. Some villages had unclear procedures, incorrect deadlines, and failed to submit reports on time, making it difficult to monitor. To improve future loan work, the meeting proposed three suggestions: (1) The focus of future loans should be on vigorously developing water conservancy. Therefore, loans that have matured should be recovered in a timely manner and converted into water conservancy loans, ensuring continuous circulation. (2) Further implement production policies, conduct universal inspections, and urge the masses to truly use the funds for production. Loans should be resolutely recovered from those who waste funds, demand money, or engage in speculative transactions. (3) The accounting department should send special personnel to each society to inspect loan procedures and account management, to correct and prevent confusion in procedures and accounts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大力发展水利　深县确定贷款重点\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大力发展水利\n    深县确定贷款重点\n    【冀中讯】深县推进社于六月五日，召集农贷干部及各分社主任开会，检查总结贷款工作，讨论今后贷款的检查和使用的重点。自三月二十五日到五月二十九日，全县共贷款十一亿四千零五十九万余元（边币，下同），贷到二百零七个穷困的村庄，计中农四百零六户，贫农三千零五十三户。其中农业贷款七亿七千九百五十七万余元，占贷款总数的百分之六十八点三五，带起私资两亿一千零三十四万余元。买牲口三百八十二头，农具一千四百五十六件（包括犁、耙、大车、锄等），及肥料种子等。副业贷款共一亿九千一百四十五万余元，占贷款总数百分之十六点八，带动私资六千三百零九万余元，扶助了木厂十五座，轧花组十三组，油坊三组，造纸厂三组，纺织组八十二组。五区南邵庄的榨油组原有十四股，每股二十万，推进社贷给六百万元。该组由妇女搓花生、看碾子，男人干重活，二十天赚了七百万元。水利贷款一亿六千九百五十六万元，占贷款总数百分之十四点八五，带动私资一亿零三百八十五万元，打洋井十眼，买水车五十九辆，修理旧水车四辆，买水斗子二百二十四个。贷款的检查工作比以前深入了，随贷随检查，多方面访问，检查实物，并发动群众互相检查，效果甚好。该县贷款工作，虽有以上成绩，也发生了一些偏向。有的区工作不深入，左右摇摆，没很好贯彻群众路线，有的贷款人乘机捣了鬼。有的村办理手续不清，期限不对，报告表不按时作，很难掌握。为改进今后贷款工作，会上提出三个意见：（一）今后贷款重点，应是大力发展水利，因此贷款到期的，应及时收回来，转为水利贷款，作到周转不息。（二）进一步贯彻生产政策，普遍进行检查，督促群众把款真正用到生产上去。对浪费、要钱、作投机买卖的，应坚决将款收回。（三）会计部应派专人到各社检查贷款手续和帐目管理，纠正与防止手续与帐目混乱现象。"

    "content": "Ding County Promotes Cooperatives, Deepens Ties with the Masses\n　　Issuing Loans and Organizing Production\n　　[This Newspaper] Ding County Production Promotion Cooperative has issued a large number of production loans to support rural production, and has achieved significant results in the past four months. As of now, 1.7 billion yuan (border currency) has been issued in 505 villages in 16 districts of the county, helping farmers to purchase livestock and farm tools, and playing a certain guarantee role in the timely sowing of autumn fields. In order to develop water conservancy, the Promotion Cooperative specially organized five waterwheel factories and supported four waterwheel factories to manufacture and repair waterwheels for farmers. According to a survey of fifteen districts, the original 12,687 waterwheels in good and bad condition have now increased to 13,137, and 4,401 broken waterwheels have also been repaired. 859 new wells have been added, and 4,256 wells have been repaired. 2,895 new livestock have been added. In terms of loan recipients, in addition to solving the production difficulties of poor households, the needs of middle peasants have also been taken into account. Among the 53 households in Laihe Village, District 13, who received loans, there were three middle peasants; among the 44 households in District 6 who received loans, there were seven middle peasants. Three loans have been issued from March of this year to the present. The first loan was issued to eighty or so poor villages with little or no floating wealth, mainly to solve the difficulties of the masses in sideline production and sowing. At that time, due to a lack of experience, some detours were taken. In Huaide Village, District 6, 96 households received a loan of 29 million yuan, and 21 households received double shares. Farmer representative Yang Dabiao gambled with the loan, and some idlers did not produce after receiving the loan, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. When the leadership discovered this situation, they studied the reasons, mainly because they did not follow the mass line and did not rely on the masses to discuss; the village cadres also had incorrect ideas in their minds that they were afraid of publicizing and afraid that the masses would know that they would ask for more loans. The second loan corrected the above deviations. In Meng Village, District 12, the masses first reported and discussed publicly before the loan, and after repeated discussions, it was found that only 10 million yuan was needed from the 70 million yuan loan reported by the masses, which could drive 3.82 million yuan of private capital and repair all 40 broken waterwheels in the village. When Da Zhang Village, District 10, received loans, everyone felt that they had borrowed too little. Later, they were mobilized to make production plans, and the cadres then conducted in-depth investigations based on the plans, and found that some people demanded too much, so they helped them revise the plans, which not only solved their production difficulties, but also brought into play the role of the loans. Liu Yaba, one person, was planting six mu of land, and originally planned to borrow half the cost of a livestock animal (400,000 yuan). After detailed research, it was only necessary to borrow one-third of the cost of a livestock animal. Zhang Luoyang also planned to borrow 400,000 yuan. The village cadre helped him study the production plan and found that he had 200,000 yuan in savings and 100 jin of peanuts, so only 100,000 yuan was needed to solve all the problems. The masses in Da Chen Village, District 9, reported 19 broken waterwheels and 11 broken wells, and it would cost 17 million yuan to repair them. Everyone was mobilized to evaluate whether it was reasonable or not. At first, they couldn't break the emotional bond and thought that everyone should be able to borrow. The leadership organized ten or so people to go to each household for inspection and found that four waterwheels and two wells could still be used. Although some were broken, the original owners had the strength to repair them themselves and did not need loans. After the inspection, a mass meeting was held again to explain that the loan was to help, not to relieve, and that it must be repaid in the future. This village borrowed 8.98 million yuan this time, driving 5.63 million yuan of private capital, and repaired all the broken waterwheels and broken wells. The difficulty of irrigating the land for 170 households was solved, and the irrigated area was expanded by 590 mu. The loan focused on supporting poor villages with little land and thin land, while also trying to comprehensively solve the difficulties of all villages with water conservancy problems. Laihe Village, District 13, has a total of 126 households, with an average of 6.9 mu of land per person, but the land is thin, the yield is low, and there is a lack of fertilizer and tools. This time, a loan of more than 10 million yuan was given, driving 1.94 million yuan of private capital, and five livestock, 29 pigs, and 20 waterwheel buckets were added, and a flour mill was opened. Nan Zijin has little land, and the masses mostly rely on handicraft sidelines for their livelihoods. This time, a loan of 15.48 million yuan was given to help 63 households weave willow cans and help two flour mills and three carpenters get moving. Daqi Village, which is close to the Tang River, had most of its land washed away, and each person had an average of only a little more than three mu of land. This time, 37 weaving machines were loaned to solve the production difficulties of 60 households. In the past, the county's saltpeter industry was not developed. This time, the comrades of the Promotion Cooperative's saltpeter department discovered that 60 villages had saltpeter soil, so they vigorously organized saltpeter boiling. There were originally 16 saltpeter workers in the urban area, and now the number has increased to 34. In two months, the number of saltpeter workers in the county has increased by 107. The masses are accustomed to using urns to leach out less saltpeter, so the Promotion Cooperative personally built a saltpeter pool and taught the masses a new leaching method. In the past, Xiangzhuang Village in District 5 mainly used incense making as a sideline, but now the sales are not smooth. This time, the Promotion Cooperative loaned 11 million yuan to the village to help 16 households buy five livestock, 17 households repair two wells, and three incense makers buy two weaving machines and start weaving.\n\n(Reporter Zhao Wenzheng)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 定县推进社深入群众　发放贷款组织生产\n赵文正\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　定县推进社深入群众\n    发放贷款组织生产\n    【本报讯】定县生产推进社发放大批生产贷款，扶持农村生产，四个月来获得显著成绩。截至目前为止，全县十六个区，五○五个村庄，已发放贷款十七亿元（边币，下同），帮助农民添购牲口农具，对秋田按时下种，起了一定的保证作用。推进社为了发展水利，专门组织了五个水车厂，扶助了四个水车厂，为农民制修水车。据十五个区的调查，原有好坏水车一二六八七辆，现已增到一三一三七辆，有四、四○一辆坏水车也修好了。水井新增八五九眼，修补四二五六眼。新添牲畜二八九五头。在贷款对象上，除解决贫苦户的生产困难外，同时也照顾了中农的需要。十三区来合庄获得贷款的五十三户中，有三户中农；六区贷款户共四四户，其中有七户中农。从今年三月至现在发放了三次贷款。第一次发给八十来个没有浮财或浮财很少的贫村，主要是解决群众副业生产及下种中的困难。当时由于缺少经验，曾走了一些弯路。六区怀德村有九十六户，获得贷款二千九百万元，有二十一户得了双份。农民代表杨大彪用贷款赌博了，有些二流子贷了款不生产，引起群众很大不满。领导上发现这种情况，便研究原因，主要是没有走群众路线，没有依靠群众讨论；村干部思想中又存在着怕宣传，怕群众知道了要求多贷的不正确想法。第二次贷款时，纠正了以上的偏向。十二区孟庄在贷款前先由群众自报公议，反复讨论，结果从群众自报的七千万元贷款中，研究出只需一千万元，带动私资三百八十二万，就可以修补好全村四十辆坏水车。十区大张村贷款时，都嫌自己贷的少，后来动员大家作生产计划，干部再根据计划有重点的深入调查，发现有一些群众要求过多，便帮他修正计划，既解决了他们的生产困难，又发挥了贷款的作用。刘哑吧一口人种着六亩地，本计划贷半个牲口款（四十万元），经过详细研究后，只贷三分之一的牲口款就行了。张洛养也打算贷四十万元，村干帮他研究了生产计划，发现他家存着二十万元，还有花生一百斤，只贷十万即可解决全部问题。九区大陈村群众自报了十九辆坏水车，十一眼坏井，修好需款一千七百万元，发动大家评议，看合理不合理，起初打不破情面，认为谁也应该贷。领导上组织了十来个人，深入到各户检查，发现有四辆水车两眼井尚能使用，有些虽然坏了，原主自己有力量修，不需贷款，检查后又召开群众会，再一次说明贷款是帮助不是救济，需要者才贷，以后一定要还。该村这次贷款八百九十八万元，带动私资五百六十三万元，就把全部坏水车、坏水井修理好了。一百七十户的浇地困难得到解决，扩大浇地面积五百九十亩。贷款着重扶助地少和地薄的贫苦村庄，同时又尽量全面的解决一切水利困难的村庄。十三区来合庄共一百廿六户，每人平均地六亩九，但地薄产量少缺肥料又缺工具，此次就贷给一千多万元，带动了私资一百九十四万元，添买了五个牲口，二十九个猪，二十个水车斗子，又开了一户粉坊。南紫荆地少，群众大部靠手工副业生活，这次贷给一千五百四十八万元，帮助六十三户编柳罐，帮助两户粉坊、三个木匠活动起来。紧靠唐河的大奇村，土地大部被冲毁，每人只平均三分多地，这次贷给三十七张织布机，解决了六十户的生产困难。过去该县熬硝业不发达，这次推进社火硝部同志发现了六十个村庄有硝土，就大力组织熬硝。城关区原有硝民十六人，现增加到三十四人，两个月的时间，全县增加了硝民一百零七人。群众习惯的瓮淋出硝较少，推进社亲自建筑了一个硝池子，教给群众新式淋法。五区香庄村过去以作香为主要副业，现在销路很不畅，此次推进社贷给该村一千一百万元，帮助十六户买了五个牲口，十七户修了两眼井，三户香匠买了两张织布机，开始织布了。　　　　　　　　　　（记者赵文正）"

On the night of June 18th, when a certain unit's assault team bravely broke into the South Gate of Kaifeng first, its follow-up troops failed to keep up. The unit persisted in its captured position and fought alone for seven hours. After learning that a certain battalion of another brotherly unit that had broken in from Songmen, quickly decided to resolutely establish contact with the brotherly unit at all costs. On their way forward, the Huiji River blocked their path, and the bridge was already sealed off by the enemy's intensive artillery fire. But the battalion disregarded everything and forcibly crossed the Huiji River. After crossing the river, they were in a dangerous situation with their backs to the river and facing enemies on three sides. The enemy's fierce artillery fire destroyed their temporary fortifications, and the houses that provided cover were also set on fire. But the steel-like soldiers still rushed through numerous obstacles, risking their lives, to continue their attack forward. Meng Jiqing, the platoon deputy of the sixth company, led the troops at the forefront, holding a hand grenade in one hand and a whistle in the other, blowing the whistle while fighting, to contact the brotherly unit. They searched tirelessly for a long time, and finally heard a answering whistle near a Kuomintang army warehouse. At this time, the soldiers' excitement was beyond description. They pounced on the enemy even more bravely. Finally, the enemy was caught in a pincer attack and collapsed. The two brotherly units then merged together and continued to kill the enemy in the central area of ​​Kaifeng City shoulder to shoulder.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开封前线两支兄弟部队　相互应援打垮敌军\n\n1948-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开封前线两支兄弟部队\n    相互应援打垮敌军\n    【新华社开封前线四日电】前线记者报导：开封战役中，解放军某两支兄弟部队在战场上自动相互应援，发扬了协同动作、团结友爱的伟大精神。六月十八日夜，当某部突击队首先英勇突进开封南门时，其后续部队未能紧接跟进。该部坚持既得阵地，孤军奋战达七小时。由宋门突入的另一支兄弟部队某营得悉后，即迅速决定不惜用任何代价坚决与兄弟部队打通联系。在他们前进途中，惠济河挡住了去路，桥也早为敌人密集的炮火所封锁。但该营不顾一切强渡过惠济河。过河后他们又处于一面背河，三面临敌的危境。敌人猛烈的炮火把他们临时筑成的工事摧毁了，赖以隐蔽的房子也着了火。但钢铁般的战士们，仍然奋不顾身冲过重重障碍继续向前进攻。六连一排副孟纪清带领部队走在最前面，他一手握着手榴弹，一手拿着哨子，一面打一面吹，向兄弟部队进行联络。他们毫不灰心的寻找了很久，终于在蒋匪军用仓库附近听到了回答的哨音。这时战士们的兴奋是无法形容的。他们更勇猛的向敌人扑去。终于敌人遭受到两面夹击。纷纷溃退；两支兄弟部队随即汇合在一起，并肩向开封城中心区的敌人继续杀去。"

    "content": "【Taihang News】As the wheat harvest began in central Shanxi, our struggle to protect the wheat intensified. In the middle of this month, Yan's bandits began a large-scale invasion to seize wheat. On the 15th, the enemy used more than one regiment of troops to cover and coerce two thousand civilians to rob and cut wheat in villages on the edge of the mountains in the fourth district of Taigu, resulting in significant losses of wheat in five or six villages. On the 17th, the enemy transferred a large number of civilians from west of the road, covered by two or three regiments, and advanced to the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Taigu to seize wheat on a large scale, establishing a strict blockade. Yan's bandits in Yuci and Qi County also launched small-scale incursions to seize wheat. In response to the enemy's conspiracy, the militiamen of our border counties launched a heroic struggle to protect grain, covering the masses to rush harvest. On the 10th of this month, eight militiamen from Nan Jian'an in Qi County repelled a wheat-grabbing invasion by more than 100 Yan bandit police teams and puppet self-defense forces, killing and wounding three enemies. The defeated enemy abandoned the looted property and fled back to their lair in panic. At dawn on the 14th, more than 30 enemy police team members surrounded the village in an attempt to retaliate, but under the heroic cover of Comrade Guo Baoshan, director of our Armed Forces Committee, two enemies were killed or wounded, and the militiamen safely withdrew. On the 15th, more than 100 Yan bandits from the Eighth Column of Yuci and the puppet armed forces of Beitian Township invaded Nanliu and Futang villages in two routes, but were repelled by landmines pre-placed by our militiamen. On the 17th, more than 300 enemy from the Eighth Column of Yan's bandits in Taigu invaded Beiliu to seize wheat. The militiamen cleverly buried landmines in the places where they had previously been stationed, wounding one Yan bandit. The enemy carried the wounded soldier and fled in panic. In the sixth district of Taigu, under the leadership of cadres and the active cover of the militia rotation teams, the masses rushed to harvest day and night. The masses who had been evacuated also organized themselves to return in the night to harvest. 4,900 mu of wheat in 43 villages including Hui'an and Hexi have already harvested more than 1,100 mu. In the eastern and western suburbs of the third district of Yuci, the idea of ​​solely relying on the main force was broken, and seven mutual aid groups for rushing harvest were voluntarily formed. Each group had a militiaman specifically responsible for sentry duty. Under the slogan \"Rather have 60% harvested than 10% lost,\" more than 60 mu of wheat were harvested and threshed in one day. On the 19th, due to the active operations of a certain unit of our army, most of the wheat-grabbing Yan bandits had retreated from the mountainous areas of Taigu, and we are organizing the masses to fully launch a large-scale harvest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我榆太民兵英勇护麦　击退出犯抢麦阎匪\n\n1948-07-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　我榆太民兵英勇护麦\n    击退出犯抢麦阎匪\n    【太行讯】晋中进入麦收，我护麦斗争剧烈展开。本月中旬，阎匪开始大规模出犯抢麦，十五日敌以一个多团的兵力，掩护协迫的两千民夫，到我太谷四区山边各村抢割，有五六个村的麦子损失甚重。十七日，敌从路西协迫调来大批民夫，以两三个团掩护，进至我太谷五、六、七区大举抢麦，建立了严密的封锁线。榆次、祁县阎匪亦先后小股出犯抢麦。针对敌人阴谋，我边沿各县民兵展开英勇的护粮斗争，掩护群众抢收。本月十日，祁县南建安八个民兵击退阎匪保警队、伪自卫队百余人的抢麦进犯，打死打伤敌三名，败敌丢下抢劫到的财物，仓惶窜回老巢。十四日拂晓，敌保警队三十余名，将该村包围，企图报复，但在我武委会主任郭宝善同志等英勇掩护下，毙伤敌两名，民兵安全撤退。十五日榆次阎匪八纵队及北田乡伪武装百余，两路犯我南流、福堂村，被我民兵预置的地雷炸退。十七日，太谷敌八纵队三百余，进犯我北流抢麦，民兵机敏的将地雷埋到他们原先放哨的地方，炸伤阎匪一名，敌抬上伤兵慌忙窜回。太谷六区在干部带头、民兵轮战队积极掩护下，群众日夜抢收，转移出来的群众也有组织的连夜分散回去收割。惠安、河西等四十三村四千九百亩麦子，已割回一千一百多亩。榆次三区东西郊打破了单纯依靠主力的思想，自愿结合七个抢收互助组，每组均有民兵专负责放哨，在“宁叫六成收，不叫十成丢”的口号下，一天抢收抢打麦子六十多亩。十九日，由于我军某部积极活动，抢麦阎匪大部已由太谷山边退去，我正组织群众全力展开大抢收。"

    "content": "Government Loans Actively Support\n    Yuncheng Lu Salt Achieves Development\n    [Taiyue News] The Yuncheng Lu Salt Administration in Southern Shanxi is actively supporting the salt industry, implementing the principles of private production, private transportation, private sales, public assistance, mutual benefit for labor and capital, and consideration of both public and private interests. The salt industry has begun to see new development. Salt pond merchants such as Zhang Dunjing and Wu Xiufang, who had fled, have successively returned to resume their businesses. After the liberation of the salt ponds, the democratic government announced the above principles. The Lu Salt Administration compensated salt merchants for losses incurred due to public affairs, initially issuing 90 million yuan (Jicha currency, same below). Subsequently, it organized the restoration of the salt industry. On June 21st, it convened a meeting of all manufacturers, establishing the Hedong Lu Salt Manufacturing Plant Joint Association, democratically electing Wang Mingxian and four others as members, enabling manufacturers to develop production in an organized and planned manner. The democratic government simultaneously issued substantial loans to support manufacturers. Before June, 800 million yuan had been loaned, and in June, an additional 80 million yuan was loaned. In terms of organizing private transportation and sales, it formally announced the abolition of the monopolistic control methods of exclusive sales under the enemy, puppet, and Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan rule in the past, implementing a one-time tax collection at the site. Except for goods transported to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, which are subject to a 5% export tax, free transportation and sales are allowed in the liberated areas without further taxation. The Lu Salt Administration also organized transport and sales merchants in Yuncheng, Anyi, and Dongguo Town. Twelve were organized in Yuncheng, each receiving a loan of 5 million yuan. Currently, 19 firms, including Xiejii and Taiji, have begun transportation and sales. Three firms, including Yumin, were organized in Anyi, each receiving a loan of 1 million yuan, and another three firms were given 180,000 jin of salt to sell and repay the money. In June, the salt industry began to develop, producing 600-700 ming (equivalent to 2.5-2.6 million jin) of salt. This year's plan is to produce 2,000 ming of salt. If the plan is fully realized, the output will exceed three times the output during the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit rule. Some salt merchants who had closed down, or who had been deceived by Kuomintang propaganda and fled to Xi'an, have successively returned to resume their businesses. Ten people, including Zhang Dunjing and Wu Xiufang, have returned from Xi'an, and eight people, including Sun Zhongxian, have returned from their homes. According to salt merchants, many more are preparing to return. They said: \"This time we returned because the democratic government announced the principles of private operation, public assistance, and mutual benefit for labor and capital, and provided substantial loans to support manufacturers and develop the salt industry, so we returned.\" Some who had been closed for a long time also rushed to resume business after hearing about the democratic government's loans and support. Chen Jianzhong, the owner of the Yao Chengqiu Salt Plant, who is already seventy years old, rushed to the Lu Salt Administration on June 17th with crutches to discuss reopening the factory. He said: \"My salt plant closed down because during the internal war between Yan Xishan and Chiang Kai-shek in 1929, the capital was suppressed, and the salt was ruined by rain. Today, I know that the democratic government supports the salt industry, provides loans, and can achieve production and sales without suppressing capital, and the future is promising, so I want to resume business.\" He said with great confidence: \"I must work hard in the future.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 政府贷款积极扶植　运城潞盐获得发展\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　政府贷款积极扶植\n    运城潞盐获得发展\n    【太岳讯】晋南运城潞盐管理局积极扶植盐业，实行民产、民运、民销、公助、劳资两利、公私兼顾的方针，盐业开始得到新的发展。逃亡在外的盐池厂商张敦敬、武秀芳等陆续返回复业。盐池解放后，民主政府则宣布了以上各种方针，潞盐管理局对盐商因公所受损失作了赔偿，先发了九千万（冀钞，下同）元，接着组织恢复盐业；在六月二十一日召开全体厂商会议，成立河东潞盐制造厂联合会，民主选出王明贤等五人为委员，使厂商得以有组织有计划的发展生产。民主政府同时发出大量贷款扶植厂商；六月份以前贷出八万万元，六月份又贷出八千余万元。在组织民运民销方面，正式宣布废除过去敌伪及蒋阎统治时期包销专卖的统制办法，实行就场征税一次的办法，除运往蒋管区者须征收百分之五的出口税外，在解放区可以自由运销，再不征税。潞盐管理局又分别到运城、安邑、东郭镇组织运销商，运城组织了十二家，各贷款五百万元。现协记、泰记等十九家已开始运销。安邑组织了裕民等三家，各贷款一百万元，又给其他三家贷了十八万斤盐，卖完还钱。六月份盐业开始得到发展，出盐六、七百铭（合两千五、六百万斤），今年计划产盐两千铭。如果计划全部实现，当超过蒋阎匪统治时产量的三倍。有些已停业的盐商，或被国民党欺骗宣传跑到西安的盐商，陆续赶回，纷纷复业。从西安回来的有张敦敬、武秀芳等十人，从家里出来的有孙仲贤等八人。据盐商谈，还有不少人正准备回来。他们说：这次回来，因为民主政府宣布了民办、公助、劳资两利的方针，又大量贷　扶植厂商，发展盐业，所以我们就回来了。有些已停业很久的，也因听到民主政府贷款扶植，赶紧出来复业。姚成邱盐厂的东家陈建忠已七十岁了，六月十七日拄着拐杖赶到潞盐管理局，接洽重新开厂。他说：“我的盐厂是因为民国十八年阎锡山与蒋介石打内战，资本被压住，盐叫雨化了，就倒闭了。今天知道民主政府扶植盐业，发放贷款，能做到随产随销，不压资本，前途有利，所以要复业。”他很有信心的说：“以后可要好好干了。”"

Tang Yisheng, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit police force, in desperation, led over a hundred remnant soldiers and his chief of staff, Xue Dichou, in a blind breakout. As soon as they left the city, they were scattered. This 43-year-old, medium-sized, dark and thin \"general,\" gritting his teeth, ran for two \"li\" (Chinese mile), then could no longer hold on. He completely lost contact with his subordinates, and crawled into a sorghum field, half his head exposed, covered in mud, panting heavily. The second squad of the seventh company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army was chasing after them, and squad leader Lan Gongjian approached him with a bayonet, shouting, \"Surrender your weapon!\" Tang Yisheng immediately turned pale, trembled all over, and curled up on the ground, afraid to move. Squad leader Lan then asked, \"Where is your gun?\" Tang couldn't speak, and instinctively took out a brand-new American pistol from his waist, and handed it over with a trembling hand. Squad leader Lan, seeing that he didn't look like an ordinary officer, asked, \"What is your rank?\" Tang didn't answer. He saw that the insignia on his body had been thrown away, and mumbled vaguely, \"I am a quartermaster.\" At this time, the People's Liberation Army soldiers found a lot of silver dollars, opium, and valuable medicines on him, and returned them to him on the spot. Tang Yisheng had a flash of inspiration, and pretending to smile, said, \"I have a lot of money here, do you want it?\" Our soldiers gave him a stern refusal, and immediately escorted him away from the front line. Arriving at the temporary prisoner of war camp, this \"general\" was not like his soldiers. In the midst of shock, he didn't forget his status. He didn't sit with his soldiers, but sulked alone, sighing, his eyes red, and he even sadly shed tears. Our instructor, Yu Jinhai, cleverly asked this \"quartermaster,\" \"Why did you break out? Was it ordered by your superiors?\" Tang carelessly replied, \"It was requested by the subordinates. The breakout was a complete mess.\" As soon as he finished speaking, his face turned red, and he realized that he had revealed his true colors.

The original text is as follows: Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to prevent enemy agents and spies from infiltrating the Liberated Areas to carry out sabotage, a road pass system has been implemented for travelers. This played a significant role in ensuring the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and protecting the safety of the people at that time. Now, the armed enemies in the hinterland of our North China Liberated Areas have been basically eliminated, and the war has been directed towards the border areas or enemy-occupied areas. The vast hinterland has been completely connected into one piece. Continuing this road pass system is no longer necessary, but instead restricts people's travel and commercial activities, hindering economic development. For this reason, it is hereby ordered that the road pass system be abolished in all consolidated areas, and that merchants and people are free to move to and fro. No troops, organizations, or groups may obstruct them unless according to law. However, border areas should still pay close attention to preventing the activities of enemy agents and spies. Those leaving the Liberated Areas to go to enemy-occupied areas and those coming to the Liberated Areas from enemy-occupied areas must still be inspected according to law and complete entry and exit registration procedures and obtain entry and exit permits. All those who have already obtained exit or entry permits are allowed to freely exit or enter the country without further restrictions. Except for the Measures for the Administration of Entry and Exit of Civilians and Merchants, which shall be handled in accordance with the current system for the time being, and unified measures will be announced separately thereafter, this is hereby ordered to be followed uniformly throughout the region.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会颁发通令  取消巩固区内路条制度\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会颁发通令\n    取消巩固区内路条制度\n    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府暨晋察冀边区行政委员会于六月二十四日颁发通令，取消巩固区内路条制度，原文如下：抗战以来，为防止敌探奸细混入解放区进行破坏，曾对来往行人实行路条制度。这对当时保障抗日战争胜利和保障人民安全，都起了很大的作用。现在我华北解放区内地的武装敌人都已基本肃清，战争已引向边缘地区或敌占区，广大内地已完全联成一片，再继续这种路条制度已无必要，反使人民来往及商旅活动受到限制，妨碍经济发展。为此特通令在一切巩固区内取消路条制度，商旅人民迁徙往来，一律自由，任何部队、机关、团体非依法律，不得阻碍。但边缘地区仍应严密注意防止敌探奸细的活动。自解放区出境到敌占区及从敌占区来解放区者仍须依法受检查，并履行出入境登记手续，领取出入境证。凡一切已领有出境或入境证件者，均允许其自由出境或入境，不再加以限制。除民商出入境管理办法暂依现行制度办理，随后并即另行公布统一办法外，特通令全区一律遵行。"

    "content": "[Hebei-Central News] Deep County Party Committee, after inspection, found serious chaos in the rear wartime support work and proposed four improvement measures. In Fengjiaying Village, First District, over six months, there were more than 2,900 labor days for wartime support. After inspection, only more than 230 were reasonably mobilized, with illegal mobilization accounting for over 90% of the total. In Yuantou, Fourth District, when a civilian laborer performed wartime service, the village assigned him a large ox to plow the land, only plowing seven fen (a unit of area) a day, and also provided three meals, wasting manpower and resources. The provision of labor and the implementation of the \"Qi Gong\" (equal labor) system in many villages were unreasonable. Some households were sent four or five times a month, while others were never sent at all. In many villages, the burden of service was too narrow, and the exemption from service was too broad. In Daliu Village, Fourth District, all seventy or so village cadres were exempt from wartime service. Some masses, due to excessive wartime service, even exchanged good livestock for bad ones, and some simply sold them. The reasons for these chaotic and unreasonable phenomena are mainly that cadres did not pay attention to this work, there was no dedicated person in charge, and some even wanted to find advantages for themselves, allowing some people to exploit loopholes. In order to correct these chaotic phenomena and improve the wartime support burden, the County Party Committee has put forward four measures: (1) Expand the scope of service: All people of eligible age for service (except those exempted by the government) shall bear the rear service tasks in a reasonable manner. (2) Mobilize the masses to discuss democratically, determine grades, and bear wartime service, and establish a method for calculating work and achieving equal labor. If there is excessive or insufficient service, labor can be repaid with production or in-kind. (3) Strictly prohibit illegal mobilization of manpower and animal power. (4) Strengthen the leadership of wartime service work, establish a reporting system, and solve problems in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 深县战勤工作混乱　县委提出改进办法\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　深县战勤工作混乱\n    县委提出改进办法\n    【冀中讯】深县县委检查出后方战勤工作存在着严重的混乱现象，提出四项改进办法。一区冯家营村六个月出勤工二千九百多个，经过检查，其中合理动员出只有二百三十多个，非法动员的占总数的百分之九十强。四区院头一个民工出了战勤，村里给他派了一个大牛耕地，一天只耕七分，还管了三顿饭，浪费了人力物力。许多村庄出工、齐工不够合理，有的一户一月出四、五次，有的户一次没出过。不少村庄勤务负担面太窄，免勤面太宽。四区大流村七十多个村干部一律不出勤务。有些群众因出勤过多，竟把好牲口换成坏的，有的干脆卖了。造成这些混乱与不合理现象的原因，主要是干部没有重视这个工作，没有专人掌握，甚至自己也想找便宜，使某些人钻了空子。县委为了纠正这些混乱现象，改进战勤负担，特提出四项办法：（一）扩大出勤面：凡够出勤年龄的人（政府规定免勤者除外），一律按合理的办法负担后勤任务。（二）发动群众民主讨论，定出等级，负担战勤、建立计工齐工办法。如有出勤过多过少的，可用生产还工或实物还工。（三）严格禁止非法动员人力畜力。（四）加强勤务工作的领导，树立汇报制度，发现问题及时解决。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th. The Suide Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, due to frost damage to summer crops in some areas and serious bureaucratism on the part of the local leadership in disaster relief, saw the disaster situation worsen again in May. Starvation deaths and widespread edema occurred in some areas. Emergency relief efforts are now underway, along with a resolute struggle against bureaucratism. In late May, the Border Region Government dispatched Secretary-General and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Wang Ziyi, to the area to supervise production and disaster relief, and allocated 500 shi of grain for emergency relief. The Suide Sub-district Party Committee also conducted a review and convened a mobilization meeting of over 200 cadres on May 27th. In addition to launching a donation campaign within the sub-district organs, it also dispatched 16 responsible cadres, including the head of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee, the secretary of the Commissioner's Office, and the director of the sub-district Women's Federation, to various counties to assist in the rescue work. Secretary-General Wang, after inspecting the disaster relief work in the area, stated: The Suide Sub-district suffered extremely heavy damage from the Hu bandits and natural disasters last year. Since last winter, the disaster situation has been the most serious in the entire Border Region. Through the efforts of the Border Region Government in allocating 13,000 shi of grain from last winter to this spring, and the efforts of the cadres and masses in the area, the disaster situation had once been alleviated. However, due to the existence of a purely relief-oriented viewpoint and initial 麻痹 paralysis in the thinking and execution of the local leadership organs, the disaster situation has unfortunately worsened again today. Secretary-General Wang emphasized: In order to enhance the high sense of responsibility of every Party member and cadre for disaster relief, and to truly achieve the goal of saving lives, revolutionary discipline should be strengthened, and personnel who have committed serious mistakes must be severely punished, and if necessary, handed over to the court for trial. Zhang Bangying, Secretary of the Suide Sub-district Party Committee, also made the following review of the sub-district's past disaster relief work: First, there was a disregard for the disaster, with the assumption that the disaster situation would not be as serious as it is today, reflecting the irresponsibility of the sub-district's leadership at all levels and bureaucratism towards the people. For example, Zhenchuan County did not conduct in-depth and specific investigations, initially reporting to the Commissioner's Office that the county had 16,000 disaster victims, but later investigation revealed the actual number to be 40,000. Second, the organization for transporting relief grain was not strict, and it was not transported back in a timely manner, resulting in only 7,000 to 8,000 shi of the 13,000 shi of relief grain reaching the disaster victims, with the remainder being completely consumed and wasted. Third, there was average distribution without focus.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 绥德分区经过检讨现正全力进行急救\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　绥德分区经过检讨现正全力进行急救\n    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边区绥德分区，因部分地区夏田遭冻，以及该地领导机关在救灾中犯了严重的官僚主义，五月间灾情又趋恶化，个别地区并发生饿死人及大批饿肿人的现象，现正全力急救，并与官僚主义进行坚决斗争。边区政府于五月下旬即特派秘书长兼民政厅长王子宜亲赴该区督导生产救灾，并拨粮五百石急救。绥德分区中共地委亦作了检讨，并于五月二十七日召开了二百余干部的动员大会，除在分区机关中展开募捐运动外，又续派地委宣传部长、专署秘书、分区妇联主任等十六名负责干部分赴各县协助抢救工作。兹王秘书长检查该区救灾工作后称：绥德分区因去年遭受胡祸与天灾极重，自去冬开始，灾情即为全边区最严重者。经去冬今春边府拨粮一万三千石及该区干部群众之努力，灾情曾一度减轻；但由于该区领导机关在思想上与执行中存在单纯救济观点和初期漠视灾情的麻痹思想，以致又发生今天灾情转重的现象。王秘书长强调指出：为提高每个党员干部对救灾的高度责任心，真正达到救灾救死的目的，应加强革命纪律，对犯了严重错误的人员必须严厉惩办，必要时交法庭审判。中共地委书记张邦英对分区过去救灾工作亦作了如下检讨：第一、漠视灾荒，以为灾情不会象今天这样严重，表现了分区各级领导对人民不负责任的官僚主义。如镇川县即未作深入具体调查，开始向专署报告该县灾民为一万六千人，但以后一查，实数却是四万人。第二、运救济粮组织不严密，未能按时运回，致一万三千石救济粮只有七八千石分到灾民手中，其余完全被消耗浪费了。第三、无重点的平均发放。"

    "content": "Several Problems in Changzhi Production\n\nChangzhi's production campaign is currently at a critical juncture, with weeding, crop rotation after the wheat harvest, and fertilizer application for plowing. In order for the leadership to promptly address the current difficulties in the movement and advance the production campaign, the production situation and problems in the Fourth and Fifth Districts, which started spring plowing earlier this year, are written out for research.\n\n　　　　I. Current Production Difficulties\n\nMost villages in Changzhi's Fourth and Fifth Districts completed planting by early May. Very little wasteland was left uncultivated. According to a check of four villages in the Fourth District—Shibazhang, Shanhou, Pingjiazhuang, and Fengbeidi—the total did not exceed ten mu. However, the following difficulties exist in current production: (1) Some wrongly labeled households lack food and drink, and individual orphaned and widowed households cannot afford to pay wages. According to a report on June 15 from nine villages in the Fifth District, including Nan Song and Bei Song, although preliminary compensation was given to wrongly labeled households and landowning rich peasants were resettled during planting, difficulties have reemerged. In Beicanghe village, 20 out of 78 households cannot afford food and drink, and in Nan Song village, there are 26 households. Bei Song and Nan Song have already lent out some grain and loans to solve the difficulties for some people. Some villages have not yet resolved the issue due to limited conditions. Living difficulties directly affect production. Gejihai's family in Nan Song planted more than two mu of millet but, fearing they could not afford wages, told the mutual aid group, \"Whether you finish weeding or not, I'll only give five work points.\" Some households who were struggled against are preoccupied with finding food and drink, only superficially weeding their own land just enough to prevent it from becoming completely overgrown. (2) Spring plowing and planting were rough, and now weeding is delaying work. According to statistics from 26 main villages in the Fourth District (out of a total of 39 in the district), when planting corn in the spring, some masses had concerns, and labor and animal power were difficult, so the preparation was rough. There were more than 22,000 mu of hard land that was planted without plowing, of which more than 4,900 mu were planted with corn. Generally, the seedlings are not growing vigorously. Now, to remedy this, it is necessary to apply additional fertilizer and cultivate the land. Lao Han, a military family member in Nan Song, planted three mu of millet on hard land and spent fifteen work points from the mutual aid group just to weed the first time, twice as much as in the past. (3) The preparation of fertilizer for top dressing is generally insufficient. In Zhao Village, Fifth District, more than 1,200 mu of corn were planted, but only 10,400 loads of night soil and manure were prepared for fertilizer, enough for more than 600 mu of land, only half the area. A large portion of the 610 mu of corn land in Bei Song has no way to be top dressed.\n\n　　　　II. Reasons for the Above Difficulties\n\nIn addition to natural causes, the main reason for the leadership's problem is the spontaneous nature of production mutual aid. The numbers of those organized in the 26 main villages in the Fourth District are not small, but the actual situation is not like that: Shanhou village reported that most people were organized, but in reality, not a single group in the entire village was active. In Fengbeidi village, with more than 80 households, only six households formed a small group. In the Fifth District, in the four villages with relatively good base points—Taiyizhang, Dongzhang, etc.—out of more than 70 mutual aid groups, only 36 were actually active together. Others only had a group leader but no mutual aid, or had collapsed last year and had not been reorganized, effectively only existing on paper. Therefore, productivity cannot be improved, increasing production difficulties. The reason for the spontaneous nature of mutual aid is that cadres do not delve into practical leadership. For example, after the cadres of Fengbeidi village in the Fourth District returned from a base point meeting, they did not study the masses' thoughts or delve into mobilizing the masses, only calling a mass meeting and telling the masses about voluntary mutual aid and checking planting. No family in the masses participated in mutual aid. The cadres simply said that the masses were not moving themselves and that there was nothing they could do, so they didn't care. The Fifth District's Nan Zhang village party secretary has been bedridden since spring, and does not even attend meetings notified by the district, so production in the village is scattered and spontaneous. Some difficulties were originally caused by administrative orders and forced rushes in last year's mutual aid, without equivalent exchange or fairness. However, some cadres one-sidedly believe that mutual aid has no benefits at all. The masses are unwilling to engage in mutual aid. The common demand in rural areas now is to rest and recuperate. They fear pointless meetings called by cadres and also fear being forced to organize mutual aid that is unprofitable for them, which is a great burden on them. Failure to correct this will greatly harm production. The masses in Zhao village in the Fifth District said, \"Even without mutual aid this year, we can still weed the seedlings on time.\" The masses in Canghe said, \"When it rains, there is no need for the higher-ups to push us. We can work in the fields even without mutual aid.\" Some said, \"Mutual aid is just cadres being subjective and adding trouble to the masses.\" This is the masses' reaction to forced mutual aid. However, as long as the principles of equivalent exchange and voluntarism are implemented, the masses still welcome mutual aid and labor exchange. Cadres, because they do not understand this, lose their direction when they see the masses being scattered and dissatisfied, and they become discouraged and give up.\n\n　　　　III. Problems in Solving Difficulties and Strengthening Leadership\n\nFirst, disaster relief, compensating wrongly labeled households, and resettling landlords and rich peasants to solve specific difficulties in production have generally begun in the First, Second, and Third Districts and will soon begin in the Fourth and Fifth Districts. However, because there is too little wheat land (wheat land accounts for only about one-tenth of the total cultivated land in the Fourth and Fifth Districts), there are still many wrongly labeled households and landlords and rich peasants who do not have wheat land. How to solve their difficulties, organize their production, and lay the foundation for production before the autumn harvest is still an important issue.\n\nSecond, to improve village-level leadership, it is necessary to simultaneously solve the cadre problem. From the perspective of the Fourth District, there are several situations among village cadres: (1) In many villages, cadres have prestige among the masses, the leadership generally maintains a tight grip, the masses' emotions are stable, and production is active, such as in Nan Song and Taiyizhang in the Fifth District. (2) Some cadres have minor shortcomings, but after criticism, they are willing to discuss solutions with the masses and continue working. However, because the higher authorities have failed to provide specific leadership, they feel timid and insecure in their work. They want to conduct self-criticism and resolve the problems, but no one takes the lead. (3) There are also a few villages where the masses are seriously dissatisfied with certain cadres, but the cadres are still not aware of it, do not want to conduct self-criticism and correction to the masses, but want to delay and shirk the issue, and are passively indifferent to their work.\n\nThird, the issue of equivalent mutual benefit in mutual aid: One is the issue of feeding livestock together. For example, Gao Huai of Beipo sold his grain and jointly bought livestock with Youcai. Youcai fed the livestock and only used them for his own transportation, without Huai getting a penny. In Nan Zhang, one group broke up the livestock and cart into separate pieces because of conflicting interests. Other villages also have similar problems. Another issue is profit sharing and equivalent exchange. For example, the agricultural association chairman in Nan Song and his small group jointly bought livestock to engage in transportation, distributing profits based on 30% for labor and 70% for capital, regardless of how much labor was contributed. Households that contributed more labor suffered losses and were dissatisfied, while households that contributed less labor benefited for nothing. In Fengbeidi village in the Fourth District, workers earn one dou of rice (16 jin) per day for blacksmithing, while the mutual aid wage is only five jin of rice per day. The coordination between agriculture and industry is not working well. Workers have to stop the furnace if they want to farm, and they have to let the land go to waste if they want to blacksmith. Some farmers, seeing that the workers earn more and they cannot share in the profits, are unwilling to participate in mutual aid and only care about finishing their own land. Another issue is the problem of households in difficulty: Households who were struggled against and households in difficulty must be helped, but if the mutual aid group collectively provides labor without pay, or without meals, or with less pay, it will form a one-sided favor, which cannot be consolidated in the long term. In the past, the leadership often emphasized this kind of one-sided care, forming coercion and undermining the principle of equivalent exchange, which often became the reason for the collapse of mutual aid. However, if they are not taken care of, the problems cannot be solved. It is hoped that all localities will study and develop appropriate solutions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长治生产中的几个问题\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长治生产中的几个问题\n    长治生产运动，当前正处在锄苗、麦收改茬、追肥耧地的紧张关头。为了领导上能够及时的解决当前运动中存在的困难，使生产运动前进一步，特将今春领导春耕较早的四、五区的生产情况及问题写出，以供研究。\n    　　　　一、当前的生产困难\n    长治四、五区一般村庄在五月初就已全部完成下种。漏下的荒地很少。据四区十八掌、山后、平家庄、峰北底等四个村的检查，总共不超过十亩。但当前的生产中存在着以下几个困难：（一）部分被错斗户没吃喝，个别孤寡户无力出工资。根据六月十五号五区南宋、北宋等九个村汇报，错斗户在下种时经过初步补偿、被斗地富经过安置后，目前又有困难发生。北苍壑村七十八户，当下吃喝顾不住的有二十户，南宋村有二十六户。北宋、南宋已借出部分粮食和贷款，解决了一部分人的困难。有些村庄因条件限制，到现在还未解决。生活困难直接影响了生产。南宋圪挤孩家种着二亩多谷，因怕出不起工资，对互助组说：“锄完锄不完，反正只出五个工票。”有些被斗户光顾闹吃喝，自己地只是过过锄，勉强荒不了就行。（二）春耕下种粗糙，现在锄地误工。四区二十六个主村（全区共三十九个）统计，春季种玉茭时，因为某些群众思想有顾虑，劳畜力困难，准备粗糙，没有犁过就种上的硬地有二万二千多亩，其中玉茭有四千九百多亩。双岗村共种玉茭六百多亩，硬地种的就有五百多亩，小苗一般发育不旺。现在要想补救就得上追肥、加工。南宋军属保山老汉硬地种三亩谷，光锄头遍就用了互助组十五个工，比过去多用一倍。（三）追肥准备一般不足。五区赵村种玉茭一千二百多亩，追肥只准备了圊粪、圈粪一万零四百担，能上地六百多亩，只够一半。北宋玉茭地六百一十亩，一大部分没法上追肥。\n    　　　　二、造成以上困难的原因\n    除过天然原因外，领导上的原因主要是生产互助自流。四区二十六个主村，组织起来的数字不小，但实际情况不是这样：山后村汇报说大多数都组织起来了，实际上全村还没有一个组活动。峰北底村八十多户，只有六户组成的一个小组。五区南基点比较好的太义掌、东掌等四个村，互助组七十多个，实际在一起活动的只有三十六个。其它有的是光有组长没有互助，有的是去年垮了就没整理，实际上只顶着一个数字。因此生产力不能提高，增加了生产困难。互助自流的原因是干部不深入实际领导。如四区峰北底村干部从基点开会回来，不研究群众思想，也不深入发动群众，光是召集了个群众大会，给群众说了一下自愿互助，检查下种；群众没有一家互助，干部光是群众自己不动，没有办法，也就不管了。五区南掌村支书从春天躺倒，区上通知开会也不参加，村上生产散漫自流。有些困难，本来是去年互助中行政命令，强制突击，不等价、公平所造成的，有些干部却片面的认为互助根本就没有好处。群众不愿意互助，现在农村普遍要求，是休养生息，他们最怕干部开无益的会，同样怕强制他们组织对他们本人无利的互助，这对他们是个大负担，不纠正将大大损害生产。五区赵村群众说：“今年没有互助，小苗也拔的不迟。”苍壑群众说：“天下了雨，上边不用推动，不互助也能上地。”有的说：“互助就是干部主观，给群众添麻烦。”这是群众对强迫互助的反映。但只要实行等价自愿的原则，群众仍然是欢迎互助变工的。干部因为不了解这个，所以一看到群众散漫不满，自己就没了主意，打退堂鼓，也不干了。\n    　　　　三、解决困难、加强领导中的问题\n    第一、救灾与补偿错斗户和安置被斗户，解决生产中的具体困难，一、二、三区已普遍开始，四、五区也即将开始。但因麦地太少（四、五区麦地约占总耕地十分之一左右），部分错斗户及地主富农没有麦地的尚多，如何解决其困难，组织其生产，打下秋前生产的基础，还是一个重要问题。\n    第二、健全村级领导，要同时解决干部问题。从四区来看，村干部有几种情况：（一）不少村庄干部在群众中有威信，领导上一般抓的紧，群众情绪稳定，生产积极。如五区南宋、太义掌等。（二）干部有些小毛病，经过批评，愿意与群众商谈解决，愿意继续工作；但因上级未能具体领导，自己觉得胆子小，工作不安心。想检讨解决，可是没人作主。（三）也有少数村庄群众对某些干部严重不满，但干部至今不觉悟，不想向群众检讨改正，却想拖延推托过去，对工作是消极不管。\n    第三、互助中的等价互利问题：一个是伙喂牲口问题。如北坡高怀的卖了粮食与有才合买了个牲口，有才喂上光自己运输，怀的一个钱得不上。南掌有一个组因为利益不合，好几股把牲口车套零散分开了。其它村也有这类问题。另一个是分红，等价问题，如南宋农会主席小组合资买牲口头搞运输，按劳三资七分红，不管入工多少都是一样分，入工多的户吃亏不满意，入工少的户就白得了利。四区峰北底村工人打铁，一人一天能赚一斗米（十六斤），互助工资一天才五斤米。农业工业配合不上，工人要种地就得停炉，要打铁就得荒地。一部分农民看着工人赚的多，自己分不上，不愿意互助，只管自己地种完就算。再一个是困难户问题：被斗户和困难户必须帮助，但如果互助组集体送工不要工资，或不吃饭，或少要工资，就形成单方面照顾，绝不能长期巩固。过去领导上时常强调这种片面照顾，形成强制，破坏了等价原则，时常成为互助垮台的原因。但如果不照顾，问题又没法解决，希各地研究妥善办法。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is resolutely opposing bureaucracy in disaster relief in order to rapidly overcome the serious famine. In addition to commending Huachi County in the Longdong Sub-region for its outstanding achievements in resettling migrants and refugees, Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, and Vice-Chairmen Yang Mingxuan and Liu Jing, severely criticized the leading organs of Mizhi County on the 15th of last month for neglecting production-based disaster relief. They pointed out: \"Because you have not paid enough attention to production-based disaster relief work, some areas have only provided passive relief, while some areas have completely neglected disaster relief work. As a result, even non-disaster areas and lightly affected areas have experienced a large number of people suffering from hunger edema, and even some deaths from starvation have occurred. The leading organs have not paid serious attention to this and have not provided rescue, which proves the extent to which you have neglected production-based disaster relief work! This is a serious manifestation of being irresponsible to the people! All cadres should be educated with this painful lesson to make them clearly understand what kind of prudent and responsible attitude they should adopt towards disaster victims in the future; otherwise, it is a crime. Now, most of the county-level cadres in your county have gone to the countryside to carry out production and rescue work, which is completely necessary and correct. It is hoped that you will maintain regular contact with them and provide timely and specific guidance to them, relying on the masses to work hard to overcome these last difficult days.\"\n\n　　The Masses Daily also published an editorial on the 14th entitled \"Eliminate Bureaucracy, Rapidly Extinguish the Famine.\" The editorial pointed out that counties such as Huachi, Jiaxian, and Jingbian have implemented the instructions of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government on disaster relief, and have specifically solved the famine problem. However, the disaster situation in some areas is still extremely serious. The basic reason is that the leading organs in these areas have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the serious famine that is related to the lives of the people. This is manifested in the failure to seriously study the instructions of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government, and the failure to conduct in-depth investigations and specifically solve the difficulties of the disaster victims, resulting in the failure to combine general disaster relief calls with specific guidance. Secondly, the two policies of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government, \"combining disaster relief with production\" and \"mobilizing the masses to help each other,\" have not been well studied and implemented, resulting in a \"pure relief viewpoint,\" and being helpless after the relief grain is distributed. The editorial pointed out that the primary task of the current production and disaster relief work is to specifically carry out the struggle against bureaucracy. From the senior leading organs, all should strictly review, summarize experience, implement discipline, and improve the enthusiasm for serving the people in accordance with the policies and instructions of the Northwest Bureau and the Border Region Government. Those responsible persons who disobey instructions and prolong the suffering of the people should be removed and punished. Party and government leading organs at the border region, sub-region, and county levels should quickly send capable personnel to the heavily affected areas to take effective measures to solve the problems of famine and epidemic diseases.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁努力克服灾荒　纠正救灾中官僚主义\n\n1948-07-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁努力克服灾荒\n    纠正救灾中官僚主义\n    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边区坚决反对救灾中的官僚主义，以迅速克服严重灾荒。陕甘宁边区政府林伯渠主席、杨明轩、刘景副主席除对踏实负责安置移民难民成绩卓著之陇东分区华池县予以表扬外，上月十五日对米脂县领导机关忽视生产救灾提出了严正批评；指出：“由于你们对生产救灾工作不够重视，有些地区只做了消极救济，有些地区则根本忽视救灾工作，以致非灾区及轻灾区也发生了大量饿肿人甚至已有饿死人的现象。而领导机关对此竟未引起严重注意和抢救，证明你们对生产救灾工作的忽视已至何种程度！这是对人民太不负责的严重表现！应以此沉痛的教训，教育所有干部，使他们明确认识今后应以何种审慎负责的态度对待灾民，否则就是犯罪。现你县县上干部已大部下乡进行生产抢救工作，这是完全必要和正确的。望与他们经常联系，并及时具体指导他们，依靠群众，努力渡过此最后艰难的日月”。\n    此间群众日报亦于十四日发表题为“肃清官僚主义，迅速扑灭灾荒”之社论。指出华池、葭县、靖边等县执行西北局及边府救灾指示，均已具体解决灾荒问题，但部分地区灾情仍极严重，其基本原因就是各该地领导机关对人民生命所关的严重灾荒采取了官僚主义态度，表现在对西北局及边府的指示没有认真研究，又不进行深入调查与具体解决灾民的困难问题，致使一般救灾号召没有与具体指导相结合。其次是对西北局及边府“救灾和生产相结合”及“发动群众互助互济”两条方针未很好研究与执行，产生“单纯救济观点”，救济粮发完了便束手无策。社论指出目前生产救灾工作的首要任务就是具体的进行反官僚主义的斗争，从高级领导机关起，均应根据西北局和边府的方针指示严格检讨，总结经验，执行纪律，提高为人民服务的热情，撤换与制裁那些违抗指示使人民延长痛苦的负责人。边区、分区及县级党政领导机关均应迅速抽派得力人员到重灾区采取有效办法解决灾荒病疫问题。"

    "content": "Our shortcomings and mistakes\n    Nevertheless, we are not unaware of our own shortcomings and mistakes. As students of Lenin and Stalin, we engage in self-criticism of our work.\n    The Central Committee, at its last meeting, pointed out the shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party, its various departments, and the Party members who hold responsible positions with the trust of the masses.\n    The root of these errors lies in the fact that the Central Committee itself recognized the nature and scale of the sudden changes in the international situation too late, especially the nature and scale of the resurgence of imperialist and anti-democratic forces under the leadership of the United States and for the benefit of the United States, and its clear elucidation was also too late.\n    Therefore, we did not, from the outset, emphasize with all necessary force that our exclusion from the government was due to the orders of the American reactionaries, and our exposed weaknesses gave Blum and Ramadier an opportunity to exploit. They wanted people to believe that the differences between us were merely on the issue of wages and prices, and we enabled them to present the excuse of merely excluding us from the government as the most important issue.\n    On the other hand, we exposed that our exclusion from the government was contrary to the laws of parliamentary democracy (in fact, this is a new symbol of the crisis of bourgeois democracy. When the working class can utilize bourgeois democracy, the capitalists immediately abandon it). This approach was correct, but we gave the impression that it was just a more or less general cabinet crisis. In reality, it was the American imperialists interfering in France's internal affairs.\n    Following this initial mistake, we did not relentlessly expose the behavior of the Socialist Party leaders and other parties in the government from the outset, regarding it as a blatant and despicable act, a shameful betrayal of national interests.\n    As a result, our delegation in the National Assembly showed hesitation and wavering, which was criticized at the last meeting of the Central Committee. We abstained from voting, instead of firmly voting against, certain government proposals (such as measures for farmers and the status of Algeria). We did not sufficiently criticize the Debré-Barach election law for municipal authorities because we had illusions about certain individuals or certain groups, without considering the new situation in the world and in France.\n    There was a time when the Party seemed hesitant in opposing a government that was severely neglecting national interests. We seemed to be influenced by the laments of the Socialist Party and others who blamed us for \"undermining the opportunity to obtain American credit, thereby harming the country.\" In short, they blamed us for not taking actions that patriots should take. In fact, on this issue and others, only we took an attitude that was absolutely in line with the interests of France, and only we took actions that were filled with a patriot's love for our country.\n    The hesitation of the Central Committee and the parliamentary delegation, to a certain extent, hindered the rapid mobilization of the working masses and the democratic people to oppose the Ramadier government and its disastrous policies, and contributed to the opportunist tendencies that the Central Committee had criticized last month, which were manifested in underestimating the strength of the working class and fearing mass movements.\n    Our September resolution stated: The responsibility of communists \"is to firmly lead mass movements, to be bold, and to have a responsible spirit.\" The Communist Party has the mission of initiating, educating, and leading the movement of the working class and the laboring masses.\n    　　　　The experience of the Popular Front\n    Here, we should ask ourselves: Have we learned lessons from past experiences, thereby benefiting the Party and the working class, and earnestly educating our cadres? For example, have we fully and clearly pointed out to the Party and the masses the shortcomings of the Popular Front and the reasons for its eventual collapse, in order to avoid repeating them?\n    The Popular Front was initiated by us, and it was quite successful and had its positive achievements, but its main shortcoming was that it became a simple agreement between leaders. We proposed establishing democratically elected Popular Front committees in factories and regions, and we proposed convening a national congress, with representatives elected by people's councils at the grassroots level, and with the national congress electing a National Assembly and tasking it with supervising the implementation of the Popular Front program. In many factories and regions, Popular Front committees were elected, but we failed to curb the Socialist Party and our other collaborators from insisting on opposing democratically elected committees and the convening of a national congress with supreme power. The Socialist Party and the Radical Party gradually removed the content of the Popular Front's struggle for bread, freedom, and peace.\n    We absorbed certain individuals, such as Daladier and Flandin, into the Popular Front according to the sole formula of \"agreement between leaders.\" Their only purpose was to betray us at the first opportunity. This is why the Popular Front did not have the strength to oppose \"non-interventionism,\" this is why the Popular Front could not prevent the betrayal of Munich. \"Non-interventionism\" was precisely initiated by Blum and the Socialist Party, and the betrayal of Munich was done by Daladier with the approval of the Socialist Party leaders. This is also why the Popular Front slowly disintegrated and completely collapsed as the war approached.\n    　　　　The experience in the Resistance Movement\n    We said and repeated these things as early as before 1939. Did we apply these experiences when we organized and led the Resistance? It must be admitted that we did not do so.\n    We were the first to resist, and for a considerable period, we were the only ones resisting. As far as we are concerned, the Resistance did not begin on June 18, 1940 (note: the day after France surrendered to Germany in World War II). It began long ago when the working class and republicans (such as the General Confederation of Labor and the League for the Defense of Human Rights) opposed non-interventionism, and later opposed Munich. During the dark period of the \"Phony War\" (note: referring to the early stages of the European War, when the British and French reactionaries tried to get the German army to attack the Soviet Union to the east, so there were no actual military actions with Germany for a long time, while domestically, the French government declared the French Communist Party illegal.), when Daladier and Bonnet, with the help of the Socialist Party, attacked our Party, split the trade unions, and destroyed our fighters, clearing the way for Hitler's troops, we carried out the French Resistance movement. We were the first to conduct the struggle for the independence and revival of France domestically. At that time, all other parties collapsed in shame and confusion.\n    From the first few months of 1941, the French people, regardless of political opinions and beliefs, joined the National Front committees, which were organized in factories or on a regional basis, or on the basis of professional activities, in diverse and flexible forms. Later, they were organized into \"French Partisans\" and squads of Free Shooters. In the National Front committees or the squads of Partisans, Socialists, Catholics, and Communists did not represent their own parties or beliefs; they participated here as people who were firmly opposed to the German aggressors and the Vichy traitors. This approach was correct, and we can say that the National Front made a great contribution to the cause of liberation. Because the National Front took root among the people, it was the only resistance movement that stood its ground in the struggle.\n    Unfortunately, we later agreed to the organization of the \"National Council of Resistance,\" which was not formed from grassroots committees and military organizations, but by direct representation from various parties and groups, as was done in the past with the Popular Front. This was even more serious because all these parties, except our Party, should bear important responsibility for the disaster of France, and they actually did almost nothing in the Resistance. In fact, these parties and groups, and their representatives who participated in the \"National Council of Resistance,\" were more concerned about the situation in France when it was liberated than about organizing effective struggle against the aggressors. They obtained de Gaulle's approval and, under his guidance, busied themselves with planning their resistance plans, which were not aimed at opposing Germany and Vichy, but at opposing the wishes that the French people were sure to express when they were liberated.\n    We must admit that tolerating the same shortcomings that led to the collapse of the Popular Front in the organization of the Resistance was a serious mistake. This shortcoming proved to be equally harmful to the national liberation movement.\n    　　　　Our Party must be more oriented towards the masses\n    Our conclusion must be this: In order to unite all working people and republicans, to defend their direct interests and freedoms, to resist the new offensive of fascism and to defend the independence of France, we must rely more on the masses. We must remember: the united front is action. Consultations and agreements that can be reached between various parties and groups are only valuable if they can strengthen the actions against the enemies of the people's republic as a result.\n    The experience of the National Front can help us discover new forms of action to unite and organize the masses. In many factories in the Paris area, workers have elected committees to defend the Republic. Unite all republicans, communists, socialists, free thinkers, and Catholics on a regional basis to organize such committees to oppose the fascist danger and oppose petty dictators. It is also possible to defend the Constitution approved by the people. Workers and republicans understand that \"revising\" the Constitution means attacking social legislation and freedoms that benefit the working people and all poor people. De Gaulle wants to abolish various nationalizations and enterprise committees, abolish social insurance, monopolize trade unions, and deprive the working class of its rights, as well as the freedoms of the French people who sacrificed countless heroes to resist aggression.\n    The struggle against the American plan to enslave our country and eliminate our national enterprises has been launched well. Actors, musicians, and everyone in the film industry have established a \"League to Defend French Cinema.\" It is foreseeable that alliances based on broad committees will gradually be organized, such as a League to Defend the French Automobile Industry, or organize an alliance with the goal of developing a serious construction plan, uniting small construction companies, construction workers, technicians, residents, people who lost their homes in the bombing, and young couples looking for a place to live, etc.\n    The question is to unite all French people who are aware of the danger threatening the Republic and harming the economic and political independence of France. The unity of the working class, the unity between communist and socialist workers, must be the foundation of this broad unity of republicans. But this does not mean that the unity of republicans and patriots must be subordinate to pre-arranged agreements between Socialist Party leaders and Socialist Party groups. Recent events have made it clear to many working people the divisive policies of the Socialist Party leaders. The shameful cooperation between the Gaullists and the Socialist Party in the municipal elections made it clear to the people that the so-called left and right wings have only relative meaning for those who openly unite with the reactionaries.\n    　　　　The government our country needs\n    It can be seen from de Gaulle's recent declaration that the danger is great. This petty dictator, encouraged and supported by the Socialist Party leaders, has made demands and threatened greatly. It is at this time that Ramadier and Blum are carrying out the division of the working class. They pretend to be simultaneously opposing the Gaullist conspirators and the loyal workers who believe in communism. In reality, the Ramadier government, as it has been doing all along, will fuel the flames of Gaullism and adventurism.\n    Only a government that is firmly based on the working masses, a government in which the working class and its Communist Party play a decisive role, can defeat the coup and the imperialist warmongers.\n    This will be a government that implements a program that meets the demands of the masses.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—Reports from various sources: The reactionary U.S. Republican Party's convention was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from June 21st to 25th. The convention, as usual, adopted a platform formulated for the election and nominated the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates for this year's election. On the 23rd, the convention adopted a reactionary platform that \"reflects the views of Wall Street\" (TASS), advocating an aggressive foreign policy, \"regional defense\" between the United States and other countries (including the Western European bloc under U.S. direction and control), and continued \"foreign aid programs,\" etc.; domestically, in addition to many empty promises made to win votes, it stubbornly declared the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law a \"wise reform\" and indicated that it would further deprive workers of their rights. On the evening of the 24th, after three rounds of voting, the meeting elected New York Governor Dewey, who has a background in the Eastern financial tycoons and is closely related to the reactionary Hoover, as the party's presidential candidate for this year's election. On the 25th, the meeting adjourned after \"electing\" California Governor Warren, who is also related to Hoover, as the party's vice-presidential candidate.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to a TASS report from Philadelphia: Dewey, the protégé of Wall Street agent Dulles, was unanimously nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in the third round of voting after fierce competition with Taft, Stassen, and other candidates at the Republican convention. Dewey's opponents prevented Dewey from getting enough votes in the first two rounds, but when the convention resumed on the afternoon of the 24th, Taft, Warren, and Stassen all announced their withdrawal from the race. The American press, including Republican newspapers, admitted that Dewey's nomination as the presidential candidate came after multiple behind-the-scenes secret meetings. After the secret meetings, the major campaign delegations at the convention agreed to withdraw their own nominations in order to exchange them for high-ranking government positions once Dewey was victorious. U.S. journalist Lawrence wrote: The issue had already been decided after big business favored Dewey. The basic political views of the main competitors for the presidential nomination were the same. Their struggle was merely a personal struggle for power and profit, with no political significance. The Howard newspaper group mentioned widespread rumors that Pennsylvania Senator Martin, who followed the instructions of the Pennsylvania party boss to withdraw his candidacy and transfer it to Dewey, may be appointed Minister of Defense in the future. According to newspaper reports, in addition to Dulles, Dewey also had the support of other important figures on Wall Street. The Alsop brothers wrote in the New York Herald Tribune: Talbott, director of the Chrysler Motor Company, who funded Dewey in 1944, oil tycoon Rockefeller, Anaconda Copper Trust, Oklahoma oil magnate Hanz, and others have generously donated to Dewey's campaign this time.\n\nWallace, the presidential candidate of the American Third Party, commenting on the Republican convention on the 25th, scorned the party's nomination of Dewey. Wallace pointed out that the Republican's campaign in Philadelphia was like many horses coming out of a stable to race. He also said: The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are both parties that advocate a \"cold war.\" And Dewey's foreign policy advisor Dulles is one of the current \"planners of the Cold War policy.\" Wallace believes that the Republican's nomination of Dewey will help the Third Party.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 共和党一群战贩多次密议后　提名杜威候选总统\n\n1948-07-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　共和党一群战贩多次密议后\n    提名杜威候选总统\n    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：反动的美国共和党的代表大会，于六月二十一日至二十五日在宾州的费城举行。该大会照例通过为了竞选而制定的政纲，并提出该党在今年大选中的总统和副总统的候选人。大会于二十三日通过了“反映华尔街观点”（塔斯社）的反动政纲，即对外主张侵略外交，主张美国与他国实行“区域联防”（包括在美国指使与控制下的西欧集团），继续“援外计划”等；对内则除去为了争取选票而作的许多空泛的诺言外，竟顽固地声言塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法为“贤明的改革”，并表示将进一步剥夺工人的权利。二十四日晚，会议在三次投票之后，选出以美国东部金融财阀为背景、并与反动分子胡佛有密切关系的纽约州州长杜威为该党今年大选中的总统候选人。二十五日，会议在“选”出同样与胡佛有关系的加州州长华伦为该党副总统候选人后已闭幕。\n    美第三党总统候选人华莱士二十五日在评论共和党大会时，藐视该党之提名杜威。华氏指出，共和党人在费城的竞选，就象许多马从一个马厩中出来赛跑一样。他又说：共和党与民主党同是主张“冷战”的党。而杜威的外交顾问杜勒斯就是目前“冷战政策的策划人之一”。华氏相信，共和党之提名杜威，将帮助第三党。\n    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社自费城报导：华尔街代办杜勒斯的干儿子杜威，在共和党大会上与塔夫脱、史塔生等竞选人剧烈交锋之后，已于第三次投票中被一致通过提名为共和党总统的候选人。杜威的对手在头两次投票中，阻止了杜威得到足够的票数，但在二十四日下午大会复会时，塔夫脱、华伦和史塔生都宣布他们退出竞选。包括共和党报纸在内的美国报界承认：杜威之被通过提名为总统候选人，是在多次幕后密议之后。大会各主要竞选代表团在密议之后，同意撤消他们自己的提名，以便在杜威一旦胜利之时，换取政府中的高官厚爵。美记者劳伦斯写道：在大企业家们属意杜威之后，问题就已经决定了。总统候选人的主要竞争者们的基本政见都是相同的。他们的斗争仅仅是个人争权夺利的斗争，没有什么政治意义。霍华德系报纸提到盛传的流言说：听从宾州（宾夕凡尼亚）党老板吩咐而收回候选人资格以转让杜威的宾州参议员马丁，将来可能被任为国防部长。据报纸消息透露，除了杜勒斯之外，杜威还获有华尔街其他重要人物的支持。阿尔索甫兄弟在纽约先驱论坛报上写道：一九四四年曾资助杜威的克利斯勒汽车公司董事泰尔波特、石油大王洛克菲勒、安那康达铜托拉斯、俄克拉荷马石油巨商汉兹等，这次都曾为杜威的竞选慷慨解囊。"

    "title": "The livestock feeding method in Beianzhuang is good; Sovereignty belongs to oneself, and the method is discussed publicly.",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-08",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Hebei Central News] Beianzhuang Village, Shen County, distributed the livestock confiscated from landlords and requisitioned from wealthy farmers to ninety-eight poor and middle peasants lacking livestock, forming twenty-two groups, with each group jointly raising one animal. The peasants devised reasonable joint feeding methods, and the livestock are being raised very well. After distributing the livestock, the village convened a meeting of joint farming households on March 16th, inviting experienced farmers who had previously jointly raised livestock to introduce their methods. District cadres also raised some issues that should be paid attention to in joint livestock raising. In order to feed the livestock well and use them properly, a Tillage Livestock Department was established under the Production Committee to specifically guide the farmers in raising livestock, and a livestock inspection system was established. Group leaders of joint livestock groups hold a joint meeting once a month, also called the \"Livestock Comparison Conference,\" which has been held three times so far, to report on the joint feeding methods of each group, exchange experiences, and study problems. The joint feeding method in the village is mostly based on the amount of land (that is, the amount of work), with rotating shifts for feeding, and there are regulations on how much fodder to feed each day. For example, the Niu Kui group feeds two large sheng of feed every day when in use, and an unspecified amount when idle. When it is my turn to feed and your turn to use, I provide the grass and you provide the feed. The Niu Daxue group feeds in one place because none of the households have a feeding place. Whoever provides the grass gets the manure, and the feed is distributed according to the amount of land. The Xue Lao Rope group originally rotated feeding, but later changed to rotating when idle and whoever uses it feeds it when busy. Some groups lack grass, so they pull carts for trade to earn money to buy grass, or the children cut grass, or more alfalfa is planted. The methods of use are: (1) During busy farming season, the Xue Lao Rope group uses \"whoever has urgent work goes first, and those with less land go first for the same amount of work.\" (2) Grinding grain should take up idle time, and fieldwork takes precedence when busy. (3) The best method is for joint livestock households to allocate labor to help each other. Because there is a lot of work such as plowing, sowing, delivering manure, and hauling soil, it is difficult to coordinate use without mutual assistance, so everyone naturally formed various forms of mutual assistance. Some are group-wide mutual assistance; some are chain-like mutual assistance, such as the Xue family helping the Wang family, and the Wang family helping the Chen family; and some are wheel-like mutual assistance. There are also regulations for attendance: The Niu Kui group stipulates that Niu Kui and Lao Shuai go on long trips, and everyone shares the fodder and travel expenses according to the amount of land, with each person receiving one jin of rice, one jin of flour, and two thousand yuan (border currency) per day for expenses. Short trips (returning the same day) are taken by the children of Feng Dalou and Li Yintang. For short trips, whoever is feeding provides the fodder. The Lin Sijiu group stipulates that Lin Sijiu and Niu Lao Zhong go on long trips, and those who do not go share the fodder according to the amount of land, while those who go do not share; whoever is feeding goes on short trips. Since the livestock are jointly fed and used, the farm tools are also organized for joint use (mainly plows, harrows, vehicles, ropes, etc.), and if they are damaged, everyone jointly shares the cost of repair. Some groups take care of military personnel, workers, martyrs' families, and other people without labor when jointly raising livestock. For example, Li Widow was assigned a cow but no one to feed it, so she handed over the fodder she should have fed to Niu Kui and others, and the manure belonged to them. Now the livestock jointly raised in Beianzhuang are all well fed, and are generally used very well except for the Chen Guozheng and other two groups. Why are the livestock in Beianzhuang jointly raised so well? The group leaders said: \"This is because we have ownership, and the livestock belongs to us; secondly, we discussed the methods ourselves.\" The village production committee's attention to this work is also a reason for raising and using them well.

A total of 3,392 enemy regular troops and 2,382 local troops were disintegrated, totaling 5,774 people. Sixteen machine guns, fifteen American-style submachine guns, 428 rifles, twenty-two short guns, 15,335 rounds of ammunition, and one 60mm mortar were seized.\n[Chahar News] Liu Lianqi, the brave and resourceful captain of the Fourth District of Yangyuan County, Chahar Province, personally persuaded thirty-two scattered soldiers of Fu’s bandits to surrender to our side, seizing thirty guns. On March 23rd, when our army liberated Yangyuan County, a small group of Fu’s bandit troops, not understanding our policy towards prisoners of war, fled to Xinzhang Village in the Fourth District outside the city to hide. Upon hearing this, Comrade Liu Lianqi immediately rushed to the village, changed into civilian clothes, and went with the village cadres to persuade them. After chatting with them for a while, Comrade Liu said to them: \"Why haven't you handed over your guns yet? Can you still leave without handing them over?\" The scattered soldiers all said, \"We are afraid of being killed if we hand them over.\" At this time, Comrade Liu explained our army's policy towards prisoners of war, explaining that not only would prisoners not be killed, but they would also be treated preferentially, and those willing to work would stay and work, and those willing to return home would be sent home. The scattered soldiers were still dubious and said: \"We want to hand over our guns, but we are afraid of being killed. Without a cadre from above to vouch for us, we won't hand them over.\" Comrade Liu immediately put on his military cap, took out his pistol, explained that he was a district cadre, and firmly guaranteed that they would not be killed. Twenty-four scattered soldiers immediately handed over their guns. At this time, another villager reported that there were still eight scattered soldiers crawling on the river beach south of the village, and no amount of persuasion would make them hand over their guns. Comrade Liu mobilized the squad leader of the scattered soldiers to persuade them. Before long, all eight scattered soldiers came carrying their guns. In total, thirty-two enemy soldiers were captured this time, and thirty guns were seized.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Liang Qishun)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳三个分区十六个月中　瓦解蒋傅军五千余\n梁启顺\n1948-07-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳三个分区十六个月中\n    瓦解蒋傅军五千余\n    【察哈尔讯】北岳三、五、六分区从去年一月到今年四月，以政治攻势配合军事出击，广泛宣传我军宽大政策及俘虏政策，争取瓦解蒋傅匪军，成绩很大。计瓦解敌正规军三三九二人，地方军二三八二人，共五七七四人。缴机枪十六挺，美式冲锋枪十五挺，步枪四二八支，短枪廿二支，子弹一五三三五发，六○炮一门。\n    【察哈尔讯】察南阳原县四区大队长刘连起机智勇敢，亲口说服傅匪散兵三十二人向我投诚，缴枪三十支。三月二十三日我军解放阳原县城时，有小股傅匪军因不了解我俘虏政策，逃至城外四区辛杖村潜伏隐蔽。刘连起同志闻讯，立即赶往该村，改穿便衣，随同该村干部前去说服。刘同志和他们说了一阵闲话后，就向他们说：“你们为什么还不缴枪？不缴枪还能走吗？”散兵们都表示“缴了怕杀”。这时刘同志就给他们讲解我军的俘虏政策，说明对俘虏不但不杀，而且还优待，愿工作的留下工作，愿回家的遣送回家。散兵们还是半信半疑的说：“我们想缴枪，就是怕杀，没上边干部作保，我们不缴。”刘同志马上戴上军帽，拿出手枪，说明自己就是区干部，坚决保证不杀他们，当场二十四个散兵都缴了枪。这时又有老乡报告，说村南河滩上还爬着八个散兵，怎样劝说也不缴枪。刘同志动员散兵班长去说服，功夫不大，八个散兵都扛着枪来了。总计这次共俘敌三十二人，缴枪三十支。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（梁启顺）"

    "content": "【Taiyue News】In Kongzhuang Village, Ji'nan Fifth District, cadres led all classes to unite in production for self-salvation, overcoming severe natural disasters. Last year, due to spring drought, 411 mu of land in the village failed to sprout, and the planted crops only yielded 30-40% of the usual harvest. Out of the 138 households in the village, 35 households ran out of food in the autumn, and 34 households \"couldn't make ends meet\" around the 20th of the first lunar month this year. People were panicking. Kong Lingyuan said, \"This year is even more frightening than the famine of 1933!\" Kong Fansheng said, \"My family doesn't have a single grain of food, what should we do!\" Some were preparing to flee the famine, while others were waiting for relief. At this time, the county called on the masses to engage in production for self-salvation. Village Chief Kong Xiangyun convened a village meeting, mobilizing everyone to unite and work hard to solve their own difficulties. He specifically announced that it was forbidden to force loans of grain from middle peasants. The pessimistic mood in the village slowly turned around, and 15 middle peasant households and 56 poor peasant households pooled together a capital of 235,000 yuan (Jizhao currency, same below) to set up an oil pressing cooperative, organizing seven livestock to press oil. In addition to fodder, each livestock earned one jin of oil per day of pressing. One person carried the oil to other villages to exchange for flower seeds, earning three jin of flower seeds for every jin of oil exchanged. Kong Fanli and 12 other middle peasants jointly engaged in long-distance transportation. From February to March 15, Kong Fanli alone earned 300,000 yuan, and even bought a mule in Henan. The other 12 people each earned an average of 100,000 yuan. Many people had no capital for production, and could not sell firewood they gathered in the mountains. Kong Xiangyun thought that oak shells could be picked, and quickly ran to the city to negotiate with the people who collected oak shells, pre-paying 950,000 yuan and agreeing to deliver 7,000 jin within three days, at a price of 190 yuan per jin. Xiangyun returned to the village and organized everyone to pick oak shells. He mobilized landlords and rich peasants, saying, \"Whoever produces it owns it.\" He also said to the primary school students, \"You also go pick, so you can eat well and study.\" Some people were afraid that they would not be able to deliver the goods after spending the money first, and would suffer embarrassment. Xiangyun then mobilized, saying, \"Don't be afraid, as long as you work hard, if you can't deliver the goods on time, you can temporarily ask the cooperative to be responsible for paying for it.\" The whole village was mobilized, some picking and some going out to buy. On the first day, 2,300 jin were completed. At this time, the price of Xichengjin oak shells suddenly rose to 200 yuan per jin. Some people asked the village chief to refund the money, wanting to sell it at a higher price in Xichengjin. The village chief asked the instructor to negotiate in the city, while leading the masses to work hard. 7,500 jin were completed in three days. Coincidentally, at this time, the whole village had to send 30 people to deliver grain. Kong Xiangyun and everyone thought of a way to use ten livestock to replace manpower, freeing up labor to pick oak shells. The cooperative also lent out 50,000 yuan, so that the livestock could buy oak shells along the way when they returned from delivering grain. Both the task of delivering grain was completed and production was carried out. Within 25 days, the whole village picked a total of 27,000 jin of oak shells, earning 2.75 million yuan, equivalent to more than 30 shi of rice, solving the food shortage during the spring plowing and sowing period. The relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. The people said, \"The village cadres work day and night, aren't they doing it for us, the people?\" Others said, \"If it weren't for the responsible leadership of the cadres, we wouldn't have earned so much money.\" Slowly, the sales of oak shells deteriorated. The village chief then thought of peeling bark to sell gouqi, and went to Qinyang to inquire about the market price of gouqi bark, and pre-paid 300,000 yuan with a buyer. Returning, he organized everyone to peel it. At that time, some people felt that 200 yuan per jin was too little. The village chief patiently explained and calculated the accounts for everyone, which was more profitable than other productions. In order to help everyone, the cooperative purchased in large quantities, and also lent capital to those who were willing to go out to buy. The whole village peeled and bought a total of 14,000 jin, earning 1.12 million yuan. To sum up, during this period, the whole village earned a total of 6.49 million yuan from running errands, selling oak shells, selling gouqi bark, and pressing oil, which could buy 110 shi of rice, overcoming the severe spring famine.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孔庄村干领导全村各阶层　团结生产战胜灾荒\n\n1948-07-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孔庄村干领导全村各阶层\n    团结生产战胜灾荒\n    【太岳讯】济源五区孔庄村，干部领导各阶层团结生产自救，战胜了严重的灾荒。这村去年因春旱，有四百一十一亩地没按住苗，种上的也只收了三、四成。全村一百三十八户，有三十五户秋天就没吃的，有三十四户到今年正月二十左右就“揭不开锅了”。人心惶惶。孔令元说：“今年比三十三年灾荒还怕！”孔凡生说：“我家没一颗粮食，这怎办呀！”有的已准备逃荒，有的等待救济。这时县上号召群众生产自救，村长孔祥运同志召开全村村民大会，动员大家团结起来，好好生产，解决自己的困难。他特别宣布了不能强迫向中农借粮。全村的悲观情绪慢慢扭转过来，就有十五户中农，五十六户贫农凑合了资本二十三万五千元（冀钞，下同），搞起一个榨油合作社，组织了七个牲口榨油。牲口除草料以外，榨一天赚一斤油。一个人担油到外村换花籽，换一斤油赚花籽三斤。孔凡礼等十三家中农合伙出外担贩运输，从二月到三月十五，孔凡礼一个人就赚了三十万元，还在河南买下一个骡子。其他十二个人每人平均都赚了十万元。很多人没本钱生产，上山打下柴火卖不了，孔祥运想到可以拾橡壳，赶忙跑到城里和收橡壳的人商量好，先支定钱九十五万元，约定三天里交货七千斤，每斤价洋一百九十元。祥运回村就组织大家上山拾橡壳，他动员地主富农说：“谁生产下是谁的。”又对小学生们说：“你们也去拾，吃饱饭好念书”。有些人怕先使钱交不了货受难为，祥运又动员说：“不怕，只要好好干，到期交不了货，可暂请合作社负责垫钱”。全村都动起来了，有的拾，有的出去收买，头一天就完成了二千三百斤。这时西承晋橡壳忽然涨了价，每斤涨到二百元，有些人向村长要求退款，要到西承晋去卖大价钱，村长便叫指导员去城里交涉，同时领导群众一股劲干，七千五百斤，三天就完成了。碰巧这时全村要出三十个人送粮，孔祥运就和大家想办法，抽十个牲口去顶人差，誊出人力拾橡壳，合作社又借出五万元，让牲口送粮回来，沿路收买橡壳，既完成送粮任务，又搞了生产，二十五天内全村共拾了橡壳二万七千斤，赚洋二百七十五万元，合米三十多石，解决了春耕下种时期的食粮困难。干部和群众的关系密切了，老百姓说：“村干部白天黑夜干，他们还不是为了咱老百姓？”还有的说：“不是干部负责领导，光咱也赚不下这些钱。”慢慢的，橡壳销路不好了，村长又想起剥树皮卖枸，就到沁阳打听枸树皮的行情，和买客预支了三十万定钱，回来组织大家剥，当时有些人嫌每斤二百元太少，村长就耐心解释，给大家算了一下帐，比其他生产都赚钱。合作社为了帮助大家，大量收买，有人愿出去收买，合作社还借给本钱。全村连剥带买共一万四千斤，得利一百一十二万元。总结全村在这一时期，跑脚、卖橡壳、卖枸皮、榨油等共收入六百四十九万元，能买米一百一十石，战胜了严重的春荒。"

    "content": "[This Newspaper] General Branch Reporters' Comprehensive Report on Several Aspects of Production Mutual Aid in the Taihang Region This Year States: Since the Border Region Government's Proclamation Announced That Land in Our Region Has Been Basically Equally Distributed, Feudalism Has Been Eliminated, and in the Future Only Small-Scale Adjustments Will Be Made, the People's Production Enthusiasm Has Increased a Step; and Since the Regional Party Committee Summarized the Region-wide Work of Supplementing, Rectifying, and Democratizing the Party, Emphasizing That: Land Has Been Thoroughly Equally Distributed, Feudalism Has Been Thoroughly Eliminated, and Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers Have Obtained Land Equivalent to the Average Amount, the Future Tasks Are to Recuperate and Multiply, Maintain Stability and Unity, and Develop Production, Since the Wheat Harvest, Sowing, and Weeding, Various Regions Have Paid Attention to the Organization and Leadership of Production: Such as Adjusting and Lending Seeds, Farm Tools, and Food Grain, Which Has Resolved Many Difficulties for the Masses; Organizing People to Pull Plows and Seed Drills to Solve Labor Shortages; Mobilizing Women and Other Auxiliary Labor to Solve Manpower Shortages (Such as in Yuanshi and Neiqiu); In Terms of Leadership Style, Many Districts and Villages Have Reviewed and Corrected the Compulsory Commandist Style, Making Production Organization More Solid (Such as in Bazhen Town, Changzhi), and Some Have Begun to Pay Attention to Combining Technical Guidance with the Demands of the Masses (Such as in Pingshun). The Production Enthusiasm of the Masses Has Indeed Increased. These Are All Good Phenomena. However, According to the Production Materials from Various County Offices, There Are Still Some Issues That Need to Be Raised: First, Some Regions Still Focus on Plans and Calls Such As \"Complete Wheat Harvesting in Five Days,\" \"Complete Sowing in Six Days,\" and \"Complete Weeding in Ten Days,\" Etc.; As For How Well It Is Done, How the Masses React, and What Problems Exist, Little Attention Is Paid. Mutual Aid and Labor Exchange Organizations Only Say That Groups Have Been Re-established Voluntarily, How Many Have Been Organized, But Little Is Seen About What Problems Have Been Raised and Solved. Therefore, the Old Compulsory Commandist Style Still Exists in Many Places; For Example, The Issue of Households Without Labor Participating in Mutual Aid in the Issue of Equivalent Value Was Not Completely Resolved for a Long Time, Causing Many Mutual Aid Groups to Collapse. How Was It Resolved This Year? It Is Hardly Mentioned. Gaoyi Says That Households With Labor Were Persuaded To Accept Households Without Labor Into the Group. This One-Sided \"Persuasion\" Can Easily Lead to Coercion. Pingshun Beiliutan Village Cadres Recently Led the Masses in \"Democratic\" Discussion and Formulated Seventeen \"Democratic\" Rules, The First of Which Is: Anyone Who Goes Out to Visit Relatives, Do Odd Jobs, or Conduct Business, Etc., Although Not Using the Road Pass System (The Border Government Has Explicitly Ordered the Abolition of This System), Must Also Inform the Mutual Aid Group, and Violators Will Be Dealt With by All the Peasants in the Village. That Is To Say, If People Think the Money Is Too Little and Are Unwilling to Work in the Group, Want to Go Out to Do Odd Jobs and Earn High Wages, The Group and the Village Can Restrict Them. The Production Newsletter Issued by the Shahe Office Criticized the Leader of the Second Group of Pengnao Village, Saying: \"One of His Three Brothers Enlisted in the Army, and There Are Still Two Laborers and One Animal. He Didn't Give Anyone Mutual Aid for a Day.\" The Comrades in the Office Intentionally or Unintentionally Believe That Anyone With Animals and Labor Must \"Help\" Others. This Kind of Thinking Is Very Popular Among Many Cadres. The Licheng Office Newsletter Reported That Ren Zhuang, A Labor Hero, Saw an Old Man Without Labor Wasting More Than Four Mu of Land (The Old Man Was Running a Small Shop in the City), So He \"Organized a Mutual Aid Team to Plant It For Him.\" How the Wage Price Was, Not a Word Was Mentioned. Some Cadres Played an Exemplary Role, Afraid That Households Without Labor Would Not Be Able to Plant Their Land, So They Drove Their Own Animals to Plant For Households Without Labor First. The Wage Was Also Not Mentioned. Mutual Aid Has Become Relief, and Not for Relatives or Friends, How Can It Be Voluntary and Lasting? Therefore, In General, Those Who Are Willing to Help Each Other Are Households Without Labor; Those With Labor and Animals Are Unwilling to Help Each Other. How to Solve This Problem? No Successful Experience Has Been Seen This Year. Secondly, The Issue of the Order of Cultivation of Mutual Aid Groups Has Still Not Been Completely Resolved. Peasants in Bazhen Town, Changzhi, Reflect: \"The Group Is Too Big, It Can't Rotate, And They Can't Weed Their Own Land.\" Li Xianshun, A New Middle Peasant in Song Village, Lucheng, Said: \"Last Year, The Four Mu of Millet I Planted, I Weeded Half of It and Then Weeded For Others Every Day. The Millet Was Overgrown With Weeds, and No One Weeded For Me. I Moved Around in the Group For Half a Year, And I Couldn't Even Get an Animal; I Wanted To Drive Four Mu of Wheat, and I Told the Group Leader Several Times, But It Was Blindly Planted When the Ground Was Frozen. This Year, The Wheat Is Growing One Hugao (Thumb and Index Finger Open, About Three or Four Inches) High. I Will Never Help Each Other in My Life. This Year, Everyone Takes Care of Themselves, and The Land Was Planted Early.\" This Year, Some Villages Adopted the Method of Dividing Large Groups Into Small Groups, But Because the Organizational Method Was Not Good, Many People Still Felt That It Was Better to Take Care of Themselves. Some People Believe: \"In Those Years of Mutual Aid, The Land Was Not Planted Well, and It Was Not Planted in Time; This Year, Without Mutual Aid, The Land Was Planted Well, and It Was Also Planted In Time, And No Land Was Wasted.\" These Are Naturally Mostly Reflections of Households With Labor and Cannot Represent Everything. If Mutual Aid Production Is Organized Well, It Will Naturally Be Much More Efficient Than Individual Production. Taihang Has Had Many Villages That Have Proved This Point. However, How to Promote Past Experience, Further Improve and Popularize It, So That All Households Without Labor and With Labor Are Benefited, How Can All Peasants Not Miss the Farming Season, And Do Better and Faster Than Individual Production? Instead of Relying on Compulsory Orders to Maintain Mutual Aid, Experience in This Area Does Need to Be Explored by Various Regions. Finally, Regarding the Methods of \"Blitz\" and \"Competition,\" Various Regions Combined With Party Rectification This Year to Expose the Mistakes Made in Many Places Last Year. For Example, In Pingshun, a Core Area With No Enemy Concerns, Green Crops Were Harvested Last Year Due to a Blitz Harvest; In Order to Complete the Plan on Time, The Masses Were Forced to Harvest at Night, Wasting a Lot of Grain; Some Even Carried Out Two or Three Weeding Operations in Quick Succession in Order to Compete for Three Weeding Operations, Which Was Actually Equal to One Operation. After Digging Over the Stubble, The Stubble Was Still There; After Weeding, The Weeds Were Still There, All in Order to Let the Cadres Get锦旗(brocade banners). Last Year in Wu'an, In the Competition to Expand Wheat Planting, A Poor Peasant in Zhao Village Could Not Afford to Plant (Could Not Find Animals, And Also Felt That Planting Wheat Would Reduce the Autumn Harvest Next Year, Affecting His Livelihood), And He Did Not Dare Not to Plant, So He Blindly Sowed Some Wheat on Several Mu of Remote Slope Land, And Did Not Apply Manure, Barely Coping With the Cadres.

In the last pre-war election in 1935, the CPC received 850,000 votes, taking 30 seats in the 300-seat parliament, making it the fourth largest party in the country. Before Czechoslovakia was betrayed to Hitler, the CPC had only 60,000 members. Before the war, the CPC was the only party that firmly fought against the Munich policy (Note: In September 1938, the heads of state of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy met in Munich, southern Germany, and stipulated that the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia be ceded to Germany. This was the so-called \"appeasement\" policy of British and French imperialism, sacrificing Czechoslovakia to encourage Hitler to attack the Soviet Union); during the war, it was the leader and organizer of the people's liberation movement; after the war, it was the leader and organizer of the new democratic regime and construction. Therefore, it enjoys extremely high prestige among the people. During the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Hitler's Germany, the CPC worked entirely underground, and 25,000 outstanding party members gloriously sacrificed themselves for the independence and freedom of the motherland, including 42 members of the Central Committee. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia on May 9, 1945, the CPC's organization developed rapidly. In the three months after liberation, its membership increased to 500,000; a year later, the number of members exceeded one million. In May 1946, in the first post-war election, the CPC won 38 percent of the total votes, becoming the largest party in the parliament; CPC Chairman Klement Gottwald also formed a new government of the National Front. From the end of 1946 to the spring of 1947, the CPC carried out a comprehensive party consolidation: the work and style of each party member were checked, those who violated party discipline were expelled, and new party membership cards were issued. After the Czechoslovak people victoriously suppressed the reactionary traitorous incident in February this year, the CPC's political prestige increased unprecedentedly, and when the new constitution was announced on May 9, its total membership reached 2,048,000. In the May 30 election, the National Front led by the CPC won 89.2 percent of the votes, occupying 293 of the 300 seats in the parliament, of which the CPC occupied 160 seats. The Chairman of the Central Committee of the CPC is the current President Klement Gottwald, and the General Secretary is Rudolf Slánský.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 捷克共产党\n\n1948-07-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　捷克共产党\n    捷克共产党产生于一九二○年十二月全国总罢工之后，由当时社会民主党中的革命分子所组成。在一九三五年战前最后一次的选举中，捷共得票八十五万，在国会三百议席中占三十席，为全国第四大党。在捷克被出卖给希特勒之前，捷共只有党员六万人。在战前，捷共是始终坚决打击慕尼黑政策的唯一政党（按一九三八年九月英法德意四国首脑在德国南部慕尼黑开会，会上规定将捷克苏台德区割给德国，这是英法帝国主义牺牲捷克以鼓励希特勒进攻苏联的所谓“绥靖”政策）；在战争中，它是人民解放运动的领导者与组织者；在战后，它是新民主政权与建设的领导者和组织者。因此，它在人民群众中的威信极高。在希特勒德国占领捷克期间，捷共是完全在地下工作的，它曾为祖国的独立自由光荣地牺牲了二万五千名优秀党员，其中有四十二名是中央委员。一九四五年五月九日捷克解放以后，捷共的组织以飞跃的速度向前发展。解放后的三个月，它的党员增至五十万；一年以后，党员数目超过一百万。一九四六年五月，捷共在战后第一次选举中获得全部选票的百分之三十八，成为国会中最大的政党；捷共主席哥特瓦尔德亦出组人民民主阵线的新政府。一九四六年年底至一九四七年春，捷共曾经实行过一次全面的整党：每个党员的工作与作风都经过检查，开除了违犯党纪的分子，颁发了新党证。今年二月捷克人民胜利地镇压了反动派叛国事件以后，捷共的政治威信空前增涨，五月九日新宪法宣布时，它的党员总数已达二百零四万八千人。在五月三十日的选举中，捷共所领导的民族阵线得票百分之八十九点二，在国会三百议席中占二百九十三席，捷共在其中占一百六十席。捷共中央委员会主席为现任总统哥特瓦尔德，总书记为斯朗斯基。"

This played a significant role in ensuring the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and protecting the safety of the people at that time. Now, the armed enemies in the interior of our North China Liberated Area have been basically eliminated, and the war has been shifted to the border areas or enemy-occupied areas. The vast interior has been completely integrated, and it is no longer necessary to continue this travel permit system. On the contrary, it restricts the movement of people and commercial activities, hindering economic development. Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the travel permit system be abolished in all consolidated areas. Merchants and people are free to move and travel, and no troops, organizations, or groups may obstruct them unless required by law. However, border areas should still pay close attention to preventing the activities of enemy agents and spies. Those leaving the liberated areas for enemy-occupied areas and those coming to the liberated areas from enemy-occupied areas must still be inspected in accordance with the law, complete entry and exit registration procedures, and obtain entry and exit permits. All those who have already obtained exit or entry permits are allowed to leave or enter freely and will no longer be restricted.

Duclos pointed out: \"Due to hatred for the people of Paris, Thiers did not hesitate to transform himself into Bismarck's ally in 1871. Today, due to hatred for the French people, the leaders of the Third Force (referring to the political combination centered on the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and a portion of the Radical Socialist Party), in complete coordination with De Gaulle and under the protection of American imperialism, have become allies of the West German Nazis. \"Duclos expressed the Communist Party's determination to lead the struggle against 'despicable politicians who dare to sign shameful enslavement treaties' in order to defend France's independence.\" Duclos concluded: \"We will fight against the Marshall Plan and everything related to it, such as the Brussels Military Alliance, the London agreement on the German question, the Franco-American bilateral treaty (which will turn France into a colony of the United States), and so on.\" Note: Thiers was the head of the bourgeois traitorous government during the Paris working-class revolution in 1871. In September 1870, the French army was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War, and the French Emperor was captured. The Prussian army continued to advance towards Paris. The people of Paris rose up to overthrow the monarchy and declared a republic; the bourgeoisie seized the opportunity to usurp power, organize a government, and under the urging of the people, announced the continuation of the war of resistance against the Prussian army, and formed a militia of more than 200,000 people, mainly workers and the poor, to defend Paris. However, the bourgeoisie feared the growth of the working class's strength and conspired to compromise with the Prussian army. In March of the following year, the traitorous government signed a traitorous treaty with Prussia, ceding territory and paying indemnities. The people of Paris rose up to oppose Thiers' treacherous behavior. On March 18, the people of Paris, under the leadership of the working class, launched an uprising and established the first proletarian revolutionary regime in history—the Paris Commune. At this time, Thiers' traitorous government fled Paris, openly colluded with the enemy of the French nation—Prussian Prime Minister Bismarck—to attack Paris, and finally strangled the Paris Commune.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法共领袖杜克洛发表演说　坚决保卫法国独立  领导人民反对一切卖国条约\n\n1948-07-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法共领袖杜克洛发表演说\n    坚决保卫法国独立\n    领导人民反对一切卖国条约\n    【新华社陕北五日电】法新社巴黎讯：法共领袖杜克洛，六月廿七日在纪念一八七一年巴黎公社人员在文森涅斯城堡被杀的会上发表演说。杜克洛指出：“由于对巴黎人民的憎恨，梯也尔在一八七一年毫不犹豫地一变而为俾斯麦的盟友。今天，由于对法国人民的憎恨，第三种力量（按指以社会党为中心之社会党、人民共和党和一部分急进社会党分子的政治结合）的领袖们，与戴高乐完全协调一致，并在美帝国主义保护之下，变成西德纳粹分子的盟友。杜克洛表示共产党决心领导反对‘卑鄙的政客们胆敢签订可耻奴役条约’的斗争，以保卫法国的独立。”杜克洛结语称：“我们将对马歇尔计划以及一切与之有关的事情，如布鲁塞尔军事同盟、伦敦对德问题协议、法美双边条约（它要把法国变成美国的殖民地）等等作斗争。”按：梯也尔是一八七一年巴黎工人阶级革命时代资产阶级卖国政府的首领。一八七○年九月，法军在普（即以后的德国）法战争中覆败，法皇被俘，普鲁士军继续向巴黎进攻。巴黎人民奋起推翻帝制，宣告共和；资产阶级乘机篡夺政权，组织政府，在人民的督促下宣布继续对普军抗战，并组成以工人及贫民为主的民军二十余万，保卫巴黎。但资产阶级恐惧工人阶级力量的增长，阴谋与普军妥协。次年三月，卖国政府即与普鲁士签订割地赔款的卖国条约。巴黎人民群起反对梯也尔卖国行为。三月十八日，巴黎人民在工人阶级领导下举行起义，建立了历史上第一个无产阶级的革命政权——巴黎公社，此时梯也尔卖国政府逃出巴黎，公开勾结法国民族敌人——普鲁士首相俾士麦，向巴黎进攻，并最后扼杀了巴黎公社。"

The newspaper's editorial said: The obligations stipulated by the bilateral agreement coming from Washington have caused disappointment bordering on fear in London. The Red Star newspaper asked: What tasks have made this London financial journal stop praising the American \"aid\" plan? The answer is that American monopoly capital insists on being given the power to arbitrarily control the economies of various countries under the Marshall Plan and to impose its will on these countries. Therefore, the British newspaper reasonably concludes that the United States is now trying to make Britain permanently dependent on American aid. This is a most noteworthy admission, but it is now somewhat late. The United States has long since begun to seize one position after another from Britain. Trade between the British Dominions and colonies is gradually shifting from Britain to the United States. American exports to British Empire dependencies have increased more than five times compared to before the war, exceeding British exports by nearly one hundred percent. Britain has in fact ceded control of the Sterling Area to the United States, and at the Havana International Trade Conference, the United States forced Britain to make significant concessions on imperial preferences. Now, British merchants finally believe that the price they have paid for acting as the United States' accountant in Europe is too high.

Among the village cadres, nine are exempt from labor drafts, and those related to the village cadres are also exempt. Some who participate in cooperatives, stores, or theatrical troupes also avoid labor drafts. Honest people suffer greatly and are very dissatisfied, causing resentment every time there is a labor draft. On June 3rd, the work team led a cadre meeting, explaining the new regulations for labor drafts. Village cadres made self-criticisms regarding the past unreasonable labor draft practices. The meeting discussed future labor draft methods, followed by a mass meeting to encourage everyone to discuss and offer opinions. Then, all those of age to participate in labor drafts were registered, and the list was posted for the masses to examine. The registration results showed that there were 76 young and middle-aged people aged 18 to 50. Except for four village cadres who were too busy, nine militiamen (militiamen should also participate in labor drafts; too many village cadres are exempt – editor's note), three disabled or seriously ill people, and six military dependents who are exempt from long-term labor drafts, the remaining 54 people are able to participate in long-term labor drafts, which is twice as many as before. Ten people, including the elderly and young, and six military dependents are assigned to short-term labor drafts. The masses are satisfied, and their enthusiasm for production has increased.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th—Reports from various sources: Under pressure from the U.S. Congress to \"cut aid,\" the governments of Western European countries participating in the \"Marshall Plan\" have successively signed \"bilateral agreements\" with the United States that are humiliating and detrimental to their sovereignty. The \"bilateral agreements\" between the United States and France, Italy, and Ireland were signed in Paris, Rome, and Dublin on June 28th. The content of the U.S.-France agreement has not been made public, but according to a communiqué from the Economic Research Office of the French General Confederation of Labor, its provisions include France allowing the United States the privilege of obtaining strategic resources from France; transferring certain French industrial development plans (especially coal production) to the U.S. Marshall Plan Administration for approval; the U.S. government retaining the right to demand devaluation of the French franc; the French government establishing a franc fund equivalent to the value of the U.S. loan, controlled by the U.S. government; and the French government must implement the trade policies formulated at the Geneva and Havana conferences. In the protocol signed at the same time, France also recognized West Germany as its most-favored nation. The content of the U.S.-Italy bilateral agreement, which has not yet been made public, was described by the U.S. State Department as \"representative.\" In a special protocol, Italy and Ireland also recognized the condition of \"granting most-favored-nation treatment in trade to West Germany, Japan, and South Korea.\" On the 29th, the United States signed \"bilateral agreements\" with the United Kingdom and Norway. According to semi-official British sources, the United Kingdom guaranteed in the agreement to supply the United States with rare materials and extended the most-favored-nation clause to West Germany and the American-occupied zone of Trieste, with the issue of Japan being left for later discussion. During the negotiation of these \"bilateral agreements,\" the United States adopted blatant coercive measures to force Western European countries to quickly sign and pass the agreements. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch on the 28th, quoting a State Department spokesman, \"After July 3rd, any recipient country must sign a bilateral agreement before receiving assistance under the European Recovery Program.\" British officials also admitted on the 26th that \"U.S. material transportation will be interrupted from July 3rd until the British Parliament approves the treaty\" (Agence France-Presse). Therefore, although the authorities of Western European countries had expressed opposition to the U.S. draft agreement's \"tone being too dictatorial\"; \"some clauses are one-sided, for example, the term of the treaty's restrictions on recipient countries is four years, while the U.S. side decides annually\"; \"some places in the draft agreement even exceed the provisions of the Havana International Trade Organization Charter, which no country has signed\" (all according to Reuters dispatch on June 10th); and the United Kingdom was even afraid that \"the current draft agreement would give the United States the right to change the pound exchange rate without consulting with the United Kingdom in advance\" (London broadcast on June 10th); they still shamefully succumbed to the will of U.S. imperialism.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西欧各国反动政府丧权辱国　与美签订“双边协定”\n\n1948-07-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西欧各国反动政府丧权辱国\n    与美签订“双边协定”\n    【新华社陕北五日电】各方报导：在美国国会“削减援助”的压力下，参加“马歇尔计划”的西欧各国政府，已相继与美国签订了丧权辱国的“双边协定”，美国与法国、意大利、爱尔兰之间的“双边协定”于六月二十八日在巴黎、罗马与都柏林签字。在内容并未公布的美法协定中，据法国总工会经济研究处的公报指出，它的条款包括法国允许美国有自法国获取战略资源的特权；将法国某些工业发展计划（特别是煤的生产）交由美国马歇尔计划执行局批准；美政府保有要求法郎贬值的权利；法政府应设立相当于所得美贷价格之法郎基金，由美政府控制之；法政府必须执行日内瓦及哈瓦那会议所制订之贸易政策。在同时签订的议定书中，法国并承认了西德是它的最惠国。内容尚未公布的美意双边协定，被美国国务院形容为“具有代表性”。在特别议定书中，意爱两国并承认了“对西德、日本及南鲜在贸易上实行最惠国待遇”的条件，二十九日、美国与英国、挪威签订了“双边协定”。据英国半官方人士透露，英国在协定中曾保证以稀有物资供给美国，并将最惠国条款扩及西德与的里雅斯特的美国占领区，仅扩及日本问题留待以后讨论。在这次“双边协定”谈判的过程中，美国曾采取了露骨的高压手段，迫使西欧各国迅速签订与通过该项协定。据美新闻处二十八日电引国务院发言人谈话称，“在七月三日以后，任何受援国须待双边协定签字之后，才能获得欧洲复兴计划下之援助。”英官方人士亦于二十六日承认，“美国物资运输将自七月三日起中断，直至英国国会批准条约为止”（法新社）。因此，虽然西欧各国当局曾表示反对美国草约“语气太专横”；“若干条款只是单方面的，例如条约对受援国的约束期限是四年，而美国方面则每年决定”；“草约中有些地方甚至已超越了哈瓦那国际贸易机构宪章的规定，而这宪章还没有一国签字”（均据路透社六月十日电）；而英国更怕“现在的草约使美国有权在事先不与英国商量，便更改英镑兑换率”（伦敦六月十日广播）；但是他们还是在美帝国主义的意志下可耻地屈服了。"

In the past, the city's market mostly dealt in European and American woolens, gold and silver jewelry, lipsticks, and face powder, and had little commercial connection with the East Line (Liberated Area), mainly dealing with semi-colonial markets such as Xi'an, Luoyang, and Tianjin. This phenomenon continued for a period even after liberation. After several months of publicity, explanation, and concrete support from the democratic government, merchants such as Lin Rongwu, Wang Xingjiang, and Wang Chunheng were the first to go to Linqing, Handan, and other places to purchase necessities for the masses, and they made great profits upon their return, influencing more than 400 other merchants to go to Linfen, Jiyuan, Meng County, Luoyang, Handan, and other places to purchase goods. In addition, several businesses spontaneously organized a capital of 5 million yuan (Ji banknotes, same below) to purchase goods in the more distant Shijiazhuang. The trade company twice sold or lent nearly 20,000 jin of cotton to merchants at low prices, which were exchanged for machines, livestock, and other goods in Luoyang and other places. In addition, some merchants exchanged the remaining Chiang currency for tobacco leaves and necessities in Xi'an. The two major businesses, Fuxingchang and Xingxingyuan, which used to deal in foreign goods, have already begun to deal in products from the Liberated Areas. Many businesses are converting to new trades. There are now six private salt depots, and it is estimated that they will soon increase to twenty.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: The Headquarters of the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has scheduled the release of Mr. Crakes, a British technician captured on Chiang Kai-shek's icebreaker during the Yingkou Campaign, on July 7th. A spokesperson for the headquarters issued the following statement regarding the incident: On February 28th of this year, the second day after our army liberated Yingkou, an icebreaker suddenly entered the port of Yingkou from Huludao, which was occupied by the Kuomintang. Our army immediately boarded the ship for inspection and ordered the crew to go ashore to investigate its origin for further processing. The democratic government of our liberated area and the People's Liberation Army have consistently adopted a policy of protection for ordinary foreign ships and their ordinary Chinese and foreign personnel under normal circumstances; however, this icebreaker entered our port from the enemy side under direct war conditions, serving the enemy's military actions, and therefore the ship and its personnel had to be detained for inspection. After the crew disembarked, Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft flew in and bombed the ship, but the crew suffered no losses due to the protection of our army. Among the crew members, in addition to 23 Chinese, there was also a technician holding a British passport. All of them were sent to the rear of our army for interrogation. The British man stated his name was Crakes, 26 years old. On December 14th of last year, he went to Tanggu from Shanghai and served as a technician on the Kuomintang's \"Beiji (North Pole) No. 1\" icebreaker. After our army verified that the British technician was merely an ordinary employee seeking a living with his technical skills, it was decided to release the British man on July 7th and send him to Zhangwu Dian, 20 kilometers northwest of Xinmin County, on the Northwest Ninglu Road in Shenyang, so that he could take a plane to Tianjin and Shanghai to contact the British Consulate. Furthermore, it is reported that the released British technician, Crakes, issued a statement before leaving, stating: \"I am a British citizen, and my profession is seafarer, working as an engineer on ships. On November 20th, 1947, I was hired by Tanggu New Port and worked as the 'Chief Technician' on the 'Beiji No. 1' tugboat, guiding the personnel in the engine room to operate the ship. After the 'Beiji No. 1' arrived in Tanggu, it was responsible for icebreaking work. On December 14th of last year, the ship sailed to Huludao, and on February 27th, 1948, it left Huludao for Yingkou, arriving in Yingkou on the morning of the 28th, going up the river (referring to the Hun River), and was captured by the People's Liberation Army in that area. On the 29th, I left the ship and was detained. I passed through many towns from Yingkou and arrived in Harbin on May 13th. The government officials who escorted me and those I came into contact with treated me very well, and the treatment in Harbin was also very good. On the way to Harbin, I heard that the 'Beiji No. 1' was bombed by Kuomintang aircraft. During my stay in the liberated areas, I felt that the situation in the liberated areas was very different from what another person in the Kuomintang area wanted me to believe. The various behaviors and military discipline in the army were very good. Every soldier felt that he had the responsibility to establish a new democratic country for the Chinese people. The education that everyone in the liberated area received on the policies of the democratic government made it easier for them to understand their goals and gave them great confidence in the future. In the liberated areas, the democratic rights and freedoms of the people have been established, prices are very stable, and the living conditions of farmers have greatly improved since the implementation of land reform. All the people in the liberated areas have a sense of security. They automatically support the democratic government. I believe that the victory of the civil war will belong to the People's Liberation Army, and all the Chinese people will be liberated and will be able to enjoy a better life forever. Because I cannot speak Chinese and there is no suitable work to do here, I would be very grateful if the democratic government could find a way to send me back.\" Crakes.

Currently, towns like Rongcheng, Baxian, Xiongxian Zangang, Banjiawo north of the Daqing River, and the vast rural areas, including large fertile wheat-producing areas, are still under our control. The enemy is compressed into a few isolated strongholds such as Baoding and Xincheng. From late May to early June, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Pingjinbao held military conferences one after another, plotting to loot wheat extensively in the liberated areas. The 32nd Provisional Division of the New 2nd Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Baoding, and some local bandits, constantly harassed our border areas of Anxin and Qingyuan, attempting to establish wheat-looting strongholds on the periphery of Baoding. Wang Fenggang's 15th and 16th Regiments north of the Daqing River also continuously harassed and looted grain. In order to thwart the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conspiracy to loot wheat, our Central Hebei local armed forces and militia actively launched attacks. Our troops on the periphery of Baoding first ambushed Gao Zhuodong, the commander of the New Second Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, near Baitapu, Xushui, on May 20, annihilating 86 bandits. Gao was seriously injured in the head and fled back to Beiping in a panic. On the 22nd, our army again repelled four regiments of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who invaded from Xu (Shui) and Bao (Ding) in the Shili Pu and Nanchang Fort area between Bao and Xu, annihilating more than 300 bandits. On June 9, the local armed forces and militia on the periphery of Baoding, in Huangtuo, more than ten miles away from Baoding, attacked three strongholds of Weijiaying and Dongcaocun southwest of Xincheng on the east side of Pinghan, and all the defending enemies were wiped out. On the same day, in Xiaofu Village, Dafu Village, and other places, fierce village tunnel warfare was launched with the bandits, defeating the attacks of three regiments of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' 31st Provisional Division and annihilating more than 130 bandits. On the 16th, our army in northern Baoding ambushed five battalions of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were dispatched from Baoding to loot wheat at Caohe, annihilating 250 bandits. Under the continuous attacks of our army and people, the Chiang Kai-shek army's 32nd Provisional Division was compressed into Baoding City, and the grain looting plan was declared bankrupt. On the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and north of the Daqing River, a part of our local armed forces and militia captured Shengfang City, an important commercial town in western Tianjin, on May 31, and took advantage of the victory to advance to the east and north of Shengfang, sweeping away bandit strongholds such as Fuguan Camp and Anlitun between Shengfang and Duliu, and once captured Yangfen Port, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits ten miles northwest of Tianjin, annihilating more than 130 people, including Gao Zezhou, the puppet Wenan County magistrate. After suffering this blow, the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs hurriedly transferred their 22nd Division and 157th Division to reinforce western Tianjin. They attacked Shengfang on the 6th. After annihilating more than 70 enemies, our army took the initiative to withdraw from the city in order to carry out wheat protection operations in a mobile manner (it is noted that the city was recaptured by us on July 1). Starting from September, a part of our army, taking advantage of the bandits' unstable foothold, cooperated with our Bohai Army to launch an offensive on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, destroying nine bandit strongholds, 20 bunkers along the coast of Beicheng River east of Tangguantun and the section from Jinghai to Tangguantun, and destroying 20 miles of electric wires. On the 12th, more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the 155th Division who occupied Shengfang went to Tongzhuangzi, Nandai, and other places north of Shengfang to loot wheat. Our local militia rose up to resist and launched village warfare with the bandits, annihilating 81 bandits. A certain village militia fought fiercely with Chiang Kai-shek bandits who outnumbered them 21 to 1 for a whole day. The bandits used rocket launchers to cover three assaults, but they were all repelled by the militia's \"sniper\" tactics. Also, when the bandits attacked a certain village, they fired more than a hundred shells and charged the militia three times, but were still bravely repelled by the militia with hand grenades. At the same time, the local armed forces and militia in Anci, Yongqing, Xiongxian, Baxian and other places also continued to inflict severe blows on the enemy with small annihilation battles. On the 21st, Wang Bandit's 1st Brigade went south of Zangang to loot wheat and was surrounded by us, annihilating more than 290 bandits.\n    In total, from late May to the end of June, in forty days, a total of 3,061 officers and soldiers, including Gao Zhuodong (injured), commander of the New Second Army of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Gao Zezhou (killed), Wenan County magistrate, and Guo Ruixiang (killed), deputy battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 20th Regiment of the Bao were killed, wounded, or captured. One curved-shooting gun, 73 60mm mortars, 41 light and heavy machine guns, 5 submachine guns, 668 long and short guns, more than 49,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 trucks, and many other items were seized. The results of these forty days exceeded the total of four and a half months from January to mid-May this year (2,843 bandits were killed, wounded, or captured). This fully demonstrates that after the new-style military reorganization movement, the morale of our army in central Hebei has been raised a hundredfold, and the combat effectiveness has been greatly improved. The Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit army, under our severe blows, is increasingly demoralized, fleeing one after another, or defecting with their weapons. In the month of May alone, our 10th Military Sub-district accommodated 1,015 Chiang Kai-shek army members who surrendered. More than 100 people fled from the 6th Security Brigade of the Jinghai puppet regime in half a month.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中四十天护麦战　歼灭蒋匪三千　大块肥沃产麦区仍为我控制\n\n1948-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中四十天护麦战\n    歼灭蒋匪三千\n    大块肥沃产麦区仍为我控制\n    【冀中三日电】分社记者报导：最近四十天（五月下旬到六月底）我冀中地方兵团、地方武装结合民兵，在平、津、保三角地区普遍展开激烈的护麦战，歼匪三千余名，将匪抢麦阴谋全部粉碎。现大清河北容城、霸县、雄县昝岗、板家窝等城镇，及广大农村，包括大块肥沃之产麦区，仍在我控制中，敌人则被压缩于保定、新城等少数孤立据点内。五月下旬到六月初，平、津、保各地蒋匪，先后召开了军事会议，阴谋向解放区大肆抢麦。保定蒋匪新二军暂卅二师及土蒋一部，不时进扰我安新、清苑等边缘区，妄图在保定外围建立抢麦据点。大清河北王匪凤岗部十五、十六两团，也不断出扰抢粮。我冀中地武民兵，为粉碎蒋匪抢麦阴谋，纷纷主动出击。保定外围我军，首于五月二十日，在徐水白塔铺附近伏击蒋匪新二军军长高卓东，歼匪八十六名，高匪头部重伤，狼狈窜回北平。廿二日，我军又在保（定）徐（水）间之十里铺、南常堡一带，击退由徐、保出犯之蒋匪四个团并歼匪三百余。六月九保定外围我地武民兵，有距保定十余里之黄陀日晚，我军一部奔袭平汉东侧新城西南之魏家营、东曹村等三据点，守敌全部就歼。同日，小福村、大福村等地，与匪展开激烈的村落地道战，打垮蒋匪暂三十一师三个团的进攻，歼匪一百三十余名。十六日，保北我军在漕河伏击由保定出动抢麦的蒋匪五个营，歼匪二百五十名。在我军民连续打击下，蒋军暂卅二师即被压缩至保定市内，抢粮计划宣告破产。在津浦北段及大清河北，我地武民兵一部，于五月三十一日，一举攻克津西商业重镇胜芳市，并乘胜向胜芳以东以北地区推进，将胜芳、独流间之富官营、安里屯等匪据点一扫而光，并一度攻克天津西北十里之蒋匪重要据点杨汾港，歼伪文安县长高泽洲以下一百三十余。蒋傅匪帮遭此打击，慌忙抽调其二十二师、一五七师两个师增援津西。于六日进攻胜芳，我军于歼敌七十余名后，为机动进行护麦战，主动撤离该市（按该市于七月一日再度为我克复）。九月起我军一部趁匪立脚未稳，又配合渤海我军，向津浦北段发动攻势，摧毁唐官屯以东、北城河沿岸及静海到唐官屯段匪据点九处，碉堡二十座，破坏电线二十里。十二日，侵占胜芳之蒋匪一五五师千余人，到胜芳以北之佟庄子、南堤等地抢麦，我当地民兵奋起阻击，与匪展开村落战，歼匪八十一名。某村民兵与二十一倍于己的蒋匪激战一整天，匪用火箭炮掩护冲锋三次，都被民兵用“冷枪”战术打退。又当匪军向某村进攻时，曾发炮百余发，向民兵冲锋三次，但仍被民兵用手榴弹英勇击退。与此同时，安次、永清、雄县、霸县等地地武民兵，也不断用小歼灭战给敌严重打击，二十一日，王匪保一旅到昝岗以南抢麦，被我包围，歼匪二百九十余名。\n    总计五月下旬到六月底，四十天中，共毙伤俘匪新二军军长高卓东（伤）、文安县长高泽洲（毙）、保二十团三营副营长郭瑞祥（毙）以下官兵三千零六十一名。缴曲射炮一门，六○炮七三门，轻重机枪四一挺，冲锋枪五支，长短枪六六八支，子弹四万九千余发，卡车三辆，其他物品甚多。这四十天战绩，超过今年一月到五月中旬四个半月的总和（毙伤俘匪二八四三名）。充分说明冀中我军经过新式整军运动后，士气百倍昂扬，战斗力大大提高，而蒋傅匪军在我严重打击下，士气日益低落，纷纷逃亡，或携械投诚。在五月份一个月中，我十分区即收容投诚之蒋军一千零一十五人。静海伪保安第六大队，半月就逃亡一百多人。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-09",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, 6th Urgent Dispatch: After nine days and nights of fierce fighting in the Biao＠ area of eastern Henan, our Huadong People's Liberation Army has completely annihilated the reorganized 75th Division and the newly organized 21st Brigade under the command of the Jiang enemy's Qu Shounian Corps, capturing generals such as Qu Shounian and Shen Chengnian alive. We are now continuing to besiege and annihilate the reorganized 25th Division under the command of Huang Botao Corps, as well as the 3rd Rapid Column, the Second General Headquarters of the Traffic Police, and other units. The reorganized 5th Division, 70th Division, 83rd Division, and the reorganized 72nd Division, originally under the command of the Qu Shounian Corps, led by Qiu Qingquan Corps, have also been divided, besieged, and annihilated by our forces, suffering heavy casualties. In particular, the local Sichuan unit, the reorganized 72nd Division (which was annihilated once last year), is completely trapped in a situation where its ammunition and food are exhausted, awaiting annihilation. Commanders and Political Commissar Chen Yi and Deputy Commander and Deputy Political Commissar Su Yu of our Huadong Field Army, in view of the 72nd Division facing its second annihilation, issued an urgent proclamation to the officers and soldiers of the division, urging them to wake up as soon as possible, liberate themselves, and avoid unnecessary sacrifice. The full text of the proclamation is as follows:\n\n　　Chen and Su Issue an Urgent Proclamation\n　　To the Besieged and Trapped Reorganized 72nd Division\n　　Urging Them to Awaken Early and Liberate Themselves\n\nGeneral Yu Jinyuan, Commander of the Reorganized 72nd Division, and all officers and soldiers:\n\nYour division is currently besieged. Regardless of the distant causes, the immediate cause is entirely due to Chiang Kai-shek's command errors. After the fall of Kaifeng, Chiang Kai-shek mistakenly judged that our army would cross the Yellow Flood Area to join forces with Liu and Deng, and attack and annihilate the Hu Lian and Wu Shaohou Corps, rather than seek battle opportunities in eastern Henan to continue fighting your army. Under this erroneous judgment, he ordered the Qiu and Qu Corps to move south from the Kaifeng-Minquan line, attempting to relieve the imagined crisis of Hu and Wu being attacked. Unexpectedly, our army withdrew from the Kaifeng-Minquan line to the Tongxu, Qixian, and Suixian line, setting a trap to welcome your army, and your army fell completely into our trap. The 75th Division and the New 21st Brigade have now been completely eliminated, and Corps Commander Qu Shounian and Division Commander Shen Chengnian have been captured at the same time. At this point, Chiang Kai-shek became anxious and hastily dispatched the Huang Botao Corps from Tengxian to reinforce, but as soon as they arrived in the Suixian area, they were surrounded by our army. Yesterday, part of them was annihilated, and the rest are about to be completely annihilated. Your division is located at Tiefo Temple in northern Sui, only twenty or thirty miles away from Huang Botao. This situation must be completely clear. Qiu Qingquan, leading the 5th, 70th, and 83rd Divisions, has been besieged in the ＠xian area for nine days of fierce fighting, suffering heavy losses and unable to take care of themselves. How can they assist your division? Hu Lian and Wu Shaohou are being held back by our Liu and Deng armies in the Yellow Flood Area, and even if they want to provide northern support, it is impossible. Your division has been besieged for ten days, trapped in a situation where food and ammunition are exhausted, and is already facing its second annihilation. We remember that when your division was annihilated in Tai'an last year, your former division commander, General Yang Wen＠, once mentioned the pain of being discriminated against by Chiang Kai-shek in the local units, and deeply regretted not being liberated earlier. General Yang is now safe and sound in Harbin, and all the officers and soldiers of your division who were liberated in Tai'an have been treated favorably. You must know this. Politically speaking, Chiang Kai-shek's regime has no future and is universally recognized. And its military decline is even more deeply experienced by your division commander and all officers and soldiers. If your division wants to make unnecessary sacrifices for Chiang Kai-shek, the dictator, you will not only leave behind eternal shame, but also fail the expectations of the elders and family members in your hometown. Only our People's Liberation Army can liberate your division. Only our Communist Party of China can guide your division to serve the people. If your division commander and all officers and soldiers are willing to raise the banner of righteousness and join the anti-Chiang united front, our army will immediately express its welcome, turn enemies into friends, and guarantee that those who return with a division will be reorganized into a division, and those who return with a brigade or regiment will be reorganized into a brigade or regiment. If there are still people in your division who are stubborn and want to sacrifice the lives of all officers and soldiers to obtain the title of Chiang's lackey and fight to the end, then our army will resolutely annihilate your division. In the Sui＠ battlefield, your division is the weakest. The reason why our army first annihilated the Qu Shounian, Shen Chengnian, and Huang Botao units without focusing on your division is that your division is a local unit and we hope your division will realize this. Now that your division is at a critical juncture, a swift decision must be made as to what to do, which is our sincere hope.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　Chen Yi, Su Yu Personally Inscribed\n　　　　　　　　　　　July 6th, Eastern Henan Front\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东人民解放军豫东大捷　歼敌一个师一个旅  俘敌兵团长区寿年师长沈澄年　正围歼整二十五师及第三快速纵队\n\n1948-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华东人民解放军豫东大捷\n    歼敌一个师一个旅\n    俘敌兵团长区寿年师长沈澄年\n    正围歼整二十五师及第三快速纵队\n    【新华社豫东前线六日急电】我华东人民解放军在豫东睥＠地区，经九日夜激战，已全歼蒋敌区寿年兵团所属之整编七十五师及新编二十一旅，生俘区寿年、沈澄年等将级军官，现正继续围歼黄伯韬兵团所属之整编二十五，及第三快速纵队，交警第二总部等部，而邱清泉兵团所率之整编第五师，七十师，八十三师，及原属区寿年兵团之整编七十二师等部亦被我分割围歼，伤亡极大，其中尤以川籍地方系整编七十二师（该师曾于去年被歼一次）完全陷于弹尽粮绝被围待歼境地。我华东野战军司令员兼政委陈毅、副司令员兼副政委粟裕两将军，鉴于七十二师面临第二次被歼之命运，特向该师官兵发出紧急文告，劝其及早醒悟，自行解放，免除无谓之牺牲。文告全文如下：\n    　陈粟两将军发出紧急文告　告被围困整的七十二师　劝其及早觉悟自行解放整编七十二师师长余锦源将军暨全体官兵均鉴：贵师此次被围，远因不论，近因则完全由于蒋介石的指挥错误。蒋介石于开封失守后，错误地判断本军将越黄泛区与刘邓会合，攻歼胡琏、吴绍周两兵团，而不是在豫东寻求战机，继续打贵军，他在这种错误判断之下，乃以邱、区两兵团，由开封民权之线南下，企图解救幻想中的胡、吴被攻危机。不料本军由开封民权之线撤至通许、杞县、睢县之线，张网以迎贵军，贵军乃全部落我网中。七十五师及新二十一旅现已全部解决，区寿年兵团长、沈澄年师长同时被俘。这时蒋介石急了，仓卒调黄伯韬兵团由滕县赶来增援，但刚到睢县地区，即被本军包围，昨日已歼一部，其余即将全歼。贵师位于睢北铁佛寺，与黄伯韬相距不过二三十里，此种情形，当已完全明了。邱清泉率五师、七十师、八十三师被围于＠县地区，激战九日，损失惨重，自顾不暇，何能援助贵师。胡琏、吴绍周被我刘邓大军钳制于黄泛区，虽欲北援，亦不可能。贵师被围旬日，陷于粮尽弹绝境地，业已面临第二次被歼命运。我等念及贵师去年被歼于泰安时，贵师前师长杨文＠将军曾经言及地方系部队所受蒋介石歧视的痛苦，深以未能早获解放为憾。杨将军现在哈尔滨，安然无恙，泰安被解放之贵师一切官兵均受优待，诸位谅必是知道的。从政治上言，蒋介石政权绝无前途，已为举世所公认。而其军事的日趋崩溃，自更为贵师长及全体官兵所切身体验。贵师如欲为蒋介石独夫作无谓之牺牲，不仅将遗万世之羞，抑且有负故乡父老家人之望。能解放贵师者，唯我人民解放军。能引导贵师转入为人民服务之途者，唯我中国共产党。贵师长及全体官兵果肯高举义旗，加入反蒋统一战线，本军当立即表示欢迎，化敌为友，保证贵师以一师来归者编为一师，以一旅一团来归者编为一旅一团。如贵师中仍有人执迷不悟，必欲牺牲全师官兵之生命，换取蒋贼走狗之头衔，坚决作战到底，则本军必将坚决歼灭贵师。在睢＠战场中，贵师是一个最弱的师。本军之所以先歼区寿年、沈澄年、黄伯韬诸部而未及贵师者，诚以贵师是一个地方系部队，希望贵师有所觉悟。现当贵师紧急关头，何去何从，迅予决择，是所至盼。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　陈毅　粟裕手启　　七月六日于豫东前线"

    "date": "1948-07-09",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 6th: Soviet Academician Avarin published an article in the Soviet \"New Times\" magazine on April 7th this year, commenting on the economic collapse in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The article stated that the economic collapse in the Kuomintang-controlled areas serves as a tragic example of the consequences of pursuing American \"aid.\" This economic collapse has now reached an unprecedented scale, and the disasters and poverty suffered by the people due to the collapse of the national economy are indescribable. Avarin cited numerous facts to point out that more than four billion US dollars in \"aid\" has only brought about a monthly increase in industrial recession, disruption of the transportation system, and deterioration of agriculture. Inflation is spiraling out of control; the only industry in Kuomintang China that is still operating at full capacity is printing banknotes. The aim of the American financial oligarchy is to save their expenses by paying the Kuomintang reactionaries at the lowest cost, hoping to build an American colonial rule over China on the ruins of China's national economy and the graves of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people. Rockefeller, Mellon, and other American financial giants are intensifying their strangulation of China's national economy. The Rockefeller Group has long controlled many important enterprises in Shanghai, including Chase Bank, Radio Corporation, and Shanghai Power Company. The commentary concluded by pointing out that the Chinese people have awakened and are yearning for a new life. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is liberating provinces and cities, cutting off the imperialist tentacles that are trying to devour their country. From the ashes, disasters, and struggles, a new anti-imperialist and democratic China is growing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党区的经济崩溃　苏联大学士阿瓦林评论\n\n1948-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党区的经济崩溃\n    苏联大学士阿瓦林评论\n    【新华社陕北六日电】苏联大学士阿瓦林于今年四月七日苏联“新时代”杂志上撰文评论国民党统治区的经济崩溃。该文称：国民党统治区的经济崩溃是追求美国“援助”的悲惨后果的榜样。这个经济崩溃现在已达空前的规模，国家经济生活的崩溃所引起的人民的灾难与贫困是难以形容的。阿瓦林列宁各项事实指出：四十多亿美元的“援助”，只是逐月带来更甚的工业萎缩、运输系统的紊乱和农业的恶化。通货飞速地膨胀，在国民党中国唯一仍然在全力开动的工业就是印刷钞票。美国财政寡头的目的是节省他们的开支，以最低的代价付与国民党反动派，而希望在中国国民经济的废墟上和数十万中国人的坟墓上，建立起美国对中国的殖民地统治。洛克菲勒、梅隆及其他美国金融巨头正加紧绞杀中国的国民经济。洛克菲勒集团早已控制了上海许多重要企业，包括大通银行、无线电公司及上海电力公司。评论最后指出：但中国人民已经觉醒并响往新的生活，中国人民解放军正解放各省份各城市，斩掉力图吞噬他们国家的帝国主义触手；从灰烬、灾难和斗争中，一个反帝的民主新中国正生长起来。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: The Kuomintang's propaganda is confused and contradictory.\n\n    It once admitted to the fact of American support for Japan, but now slanders the student patriotic movement according to its master's orders.\n\n    Shortly before the Kuomintang Central Daily News, acting on the orders of its American masters, began constantly slandering and intimidating the student patriotic movement \"Opposing American Support for Japan,\" it published an article entitled \"How Does America Support Japan?\" on May 14th. The article began with a special note: \"America's unreserved support for Japan's recovery is not only a cause of anxiety and opposition for countries in the Far East, but also for many people in the United States who have expressed doubts. This article is a selective translation of reports from the recently published 'Newsweek' and 'World Report' regarding America's support for Japan. From these accounts, we can vaguely see a powerful Japan gradually taking shape, which is truly terrifying for the Chinese people!\" When the Central Daily News, in its editorial on June 2nd, wantonly slandered patriotic students and people's opposition to American support for Japan as \"hearsay\" and \"thoughtless,\" it forgot that only nineteen days earlier, its own newspaper had published such an article \"recording the facts of American support for Japan.\" The article published by the Central Daily News not only exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' vain and shameless slander of the student patriotic movement, but also exposed the vain and shameless denials of American support for Japan by American Ambassador Stuart and the American Consul General in Shanghai, Cabot, because \"Newsweek\" and \"World Report\" are both mouthpieces of Wall Street, but even they cannot deny the fact of American support for Japan. The article acknowledged the following facts: First, the United States wants to bring Japan's industry above pre-war levels. The article stated: \"The Overseas Affairs Advisory Group led by Straker has drafted a comprehensive report stating that Japan's industry must be raised above pre-war levels in several respects. The Drapers agree with this argument. Taking shipping as an example, Straker's advisory group believes that Japan should have at least four million tons of merchant ships, and should also build 400,000 tons of new ships each year as a supplement; Japan should be allowed to retain 27 shipyards from Hakone in the north to Shimonoseki in the west, and the Maizuru Naval Shipyard should be reserved for ship repair.\" The Central Daily News specifically marked this in its sub-headline: \"Who can guarantee that raising a tiger will not cause trouble?\" Second, the United States is prepared to provide Japan with large loans, \"According to precise estimates from Washington and Tokyo in recent weeks, the United States will use 1.5 billion US dollars to implement Japan's recovery plan. American officials try to avoid using the easily offensive name 'Japan Recovery Plan,' but the goal they are actually working towards is to support Japan and make it a stronghold in the Far East.\" Third, preserve the Japanese Zaibatsu organizations. \"On May 1st, MacArthur announced that 194 companies had been removed from the list of 325 companies (referring to Zaibatsu companies that should be dispersed according to the 'Economic Decentralization Law'), and others will be gradually removed. They demanded to amend this method (referring to the 'Economic Decentralization Law') because they believed that industrial decentralization would undermine Japan's production.\" Fourth, reduce Japanese reparations and retain Japanese war industry. \"In order to promote Japan's economic recovery, the reparations policy has been revised to some extent. The initial plan to transfer all military industries as reparations has now been greatly reduced. The work of dismantling Japanese factories has now largely stopped, and the American military strongly advocates retaining secondary military industries for 'peaceful production' under appropriate supervision... As a result, Japan has retained many light and heavy industries.\" Fifth, delay the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. \"The undeclared state of peace will be extended indefinitely. Japan is currently enjoying preferential treatment that other defeated countries cannot enjoy during the armistice. With American support, Japan is striding towards recovery.\" \"America's treatment of Japan is as if Japan had never been the main culprit in a war, and is still a defeated and occupied country.\" \"The convening of a peace conference with Japan is nowhere in sight, and the United States is in no hurry to sign a peace treaty with Japan and give up the power it now exercises in Japan. On the contrary, she hopes to maintain the current informal state of peace in order to 'transform' Japan into a reliable ally in troubled Asia.\" The Central Daily News specifically pointed out in its sub-headline: This \"delaying situation is extremely beneficial to Japan,\" \"Under this ridiculous situation, Japan receives a series of benefits.\" The article finally admitted that the \"main purpose\" of all these American measures is to \"regenerate Japan and make it stand up again.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党宣传上混乱矛盾　曾招认美国扶日事实  依照其主子命令又诬蔑学生爱国运动\n\n1948-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党宣传上混乱矛盾\n    曾招认美国扶日事实\n    依照其主子命令又诬蔑学生爱国运动\n    【新华社陕北七日电】国民党中央日报在这次依照其美国主子命令，以不断的诬蔑、恫吓来反对学生“反对美国扶日”的爱国运动前不久即五月十四日，会刊载一篇题为“美国怎样扶植日本？”的文章，文首并特别注明了：“美国不遗余力支助日本复兴，不仅为远东国家所焦虑与反对，即美国也有不少人表示怀疑的态度。本文是根据纽约最近出版的“新闻周刊”与“世界报告周刊”所载关于美国如何扶植日本的情形择要移译而成。从这些记述里，我们隐约可以看出一个强大的日本正在逐渐形成，对于中国人民真不胜惧栗之至！”当中央日报在其六月二日社论中，大肆诬蔑爱国的学生和人民反对美国扶日为“道听途说”和“不加思索”的时候，却忘记了仅仅在十九天之前，自己的报纸上就曾发表过这样一篇“记述美国扶植日本”的事实的文章。中央日报所载的这篇文章不但戳穿了国民党反动派诬蔑学生爱国运动的虚妄与无耻。而且同样戳穿了美国大使司徒雷登和美驻上海总领事卡波特否认美国扶日的虚妄与无耻，因为“新闻周刊”与“世界报告周刊”都是华尔街的喉舌，但它们也不能否认美国扶植日本的事实。该文承认下列各项事实：第一，美国要使日本工业超过战前水平。该文称：“斯揣克领导的海外事务咨询团曾拟定一个综合报告书，说明日本的工业在若干方面都必须提高到超过战前的水平。德雷柏们同意这种论调。以航业为例，斯揣克的咨询团相信日本至少应有四百万吨商船，并且每年尚应制造新船四十万吨以为补充；日本应获准保有北起箱根西迄下关的造船厂二十七所，舞鹤海军造船厂应保留专供修船之用”。中央日报对此特别在其小标题中标明：“谁能担保养虎不贻患？”第二，美国准备给日本以大量贷款，“依据华盛顿和东京方面数星期以来的精确估计，美国将以十五亿美元作为实施日本复兴计划之用。美国官方尽量避免采用“日本复兴计划”这一容易招致反感的名称，但他们实际上所努力的目标，却正是把日本扶植起来，使之成为远东的堡垒”。第三，保存日本财阀组织。“五月一日麦帅宣布，在三百廿五家公司（指按照“经济分散法”应予分散的财阀公司）名单中剔除一百九十四家，其他亦将陆续删除。他们之所以要求修改这种办法（指“经济分散法”），是因为他们认为工业分散足以打击日本的生产”。第四，减低日本赔偿，保留日本战争工业。“为促成日本经济复员故，赔偿政策已作若干修正。最初计划迁移全部军需工业作为赔偿，现在已打了很大的折扣。拆卸日本工厂的工作现已在大半停顿，美国军部力主保留次要的军需工业，在适当监督之下改作“和平生产”之用，……这一来日本保留下不少轻重工业。”第五，拖延对日和约的签订。“未经明白宣布的和平状态将无限期延长。日本刻正享受其他战败国在休战期间不能享受的优待。在美国扶植之下，日本正大步走向复兴之路。”“美国之对待日本，全未当日本曾经是一个战争的祸首，和现在尚是一个战败而被占领的国家。”“对日和会的召开乃遥遥无期，美国亦并不急于签订对日和约，放弃她现在日本行使的权力。相反地，她希望维持目前的非正式和平状态，以便“改造”日本成为她在多事的亚洲的可靠的友邦。”中央日报并特别在其小标题中指明：这种“拖的局面极有利于日本”，“在这种滑稽局面下，日本受到一连串好处”。该文最后承认：美国这一切措施的“主要目的，是使日本再生，重新站立起来”。"

The declaration stated: At a time when the entire country is opposing the U.S. support for Japan and rescuing the national crisis, the U.S. is intensifying its plunder of China's sovereignty, and the government, for the sake of U.S. aid, is sacrificing national interests by selling inland waterway rights. The declaration pointed out that this treasonous deal by the Chiang government has aroused \"opposition from the National Navigation Association and people in various regions.\" After refuting Wang Shijie's fallacy that \"opening inland waterway rights does not hinder China's sovereignty,\" the declaration firmly stated: In order to oppose the opening of inland waterway rights, to protect national industry and commerce, to rescue the national crisis, and to protect the integrity of sovereignty, we are determined to promote unity among all classes, overcome all difficulties, and brave all dangers to jointly defend the independence of the Chinese nation.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 3rd, 59 prominent figures in Hong Kong's cultural and educational circles signed a declaration protesting the Siamese fascist Luang Phibuns government's瘋狂狂狂 anti-Chinese atrocities and the Chiang government's shameful \"silent\" attitude towards this matter. The declaration described the Siamese government's order on May 5th to close more than 30 overseas Chinese schools, depriving 100,000 Chinese children of the opportunity to receive education, and the arrest of more than 50 overseas Chinese on June 12th (this arrest was carried out with the direct cooperation of Chiang Kai-shek's special service organs stationed in Siam), and questioned why the Chiang government \"remains silent\" about this.

Henan University, the highest institution of learning in Henan Province, was occupied by the enemy's 66th Division on the 17th, which converted the campus into defensive fortifications and artillery positions. Students were driven out of the school, and most of the school's books and equipment were destroyed, with students' clothing looted. After Chiang's bandit troops retreated to Longting on the 18th, they coordinated with U.S.-made Chiang aircraft to launch continuous and frenzied bombings against Henan University. The school's student dormitory, New East Study Hall, was reduced to ashes by incendiary bombs, and the medical school and auditorium also suffered extensive damage. Many students were killed and wounded in the bombings. Those who have been identified include Zhang Qin, a second-year student in the Economics Department, and Liu Shushan and Liu Shixie of the Education Department, who were killed in the bombing. Other injured students have received emergency treatment from the People's Liberation Army. When Chiang's troops retreated into the city from the South Gate on the 18th, they set fires everywhere in the South Gate. Coupled with the bombings by Chiang's aircraft, the main building of Zhenguang Middle School in the South Gate was left with only its frame, and China Middle School, adjacent to the South City, was completely destroyed. From the 20th to the 21st, when Chiang's bandits gathered at the pseudo-Henan Provincial Government to resist stubbornly, they set fire to Northwest Middle School, Lianghe Middle School, Kaifeng Women's Normal School, Provincial Fourth Elementary School, and Kaifeng Radio Station in the surrounding area. When Chiang's bandits set fire to the Women's Normal School, they neither notified the students in advance nor allowed them to leave the dormitory while the fire was raging. The cries for help from the female students in the raging flames were unbearable to hear. Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army arrived at this time and rushed into the school. The students of the Women's Normal School shouted, \"The students are downstairs!\" The People's Liberation Army pursued and annihilated the fleeing enemy while rescuing the students, and all the female students were saved from the disaster. In addition, the Kaifeng Museum was partially destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits stationed in Longting. The Central China Institute of Technology was also bombed by U.S.-made Chiang aircraft. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, it repaired a ambulance for the Henan University Hospital and subsidized the Catholic Church Hospital in the South Gate for the treatment of wounded students. The People's Liberation Army also allocated a large amount of rice and flour from Chiang's army warehouse to provide relief to students of various schools, and marked and protected various cultural and educational institutions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开封文教机关惨遭蒋匪洗劫我军在炮火中尽力营救保护\n\n1948-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开封文教机关惨遭蒋匪洗劫我军在炮火中尽力营救保护\n    【新华社开封前线七日电】此次开封战役中，城内各文化机关，惨遭蒋匪洗劫。河南最高学府河南大学校舍，十七日被敌六十六师侵占，改设防御工事及炮兵阵地，学生被驱逐出校，学校图书仪器大部被毁，学生衣物被抢劫一空。十八日蒋匪军退守龙亭后，即配合美制蒋机向河南大学连续疯狂轰击，该校学生宿舍新东斋被燃烧弹毁为灰烬，医学院及大礼堂亦毁损极巨。学生多人被炸死炸伤。据已查明者有经济系二年级学生张钦、教育系刘书善、刘士燮等被炸死，其他负伤学生均经解放军予以紧急治疗。蒋军于十八日自南关溃退城内时，曾在南关到处纵火，加以蒋机轰炸，南关之真光中学大楼仅存骨架，接南城的中国中学则荡然无存。二十日至二十一日蒋匪集结伪河南省政府顽抗时，即将周围的西北中学、两河中学、开封女师、省立四小与开封广播电台等纵火焚烧。蒋匪焚烧女师时，事先既不通知，放火时又不准女学生离开宿舍，在熊熊火焰中女学生哀号求救声，惨不忍闻。幸解放军于此时赶到，冲入该校，女师同学大呼“楼下是学生”，解放军乃一面追歼溃敌，一面营救学生，全部女同学始免于难。此外，开封博物馆被据守龙亭之蒋匪炮轰摧毁一部，中原工学院亦被美制蒋机轰炸。解放军入城后，当为河南大学医院修好救护车一辆，并补助南关天主堂医院治疗受伤同学之费用。解放军并由蒋军仓库中拨出大量米面，救济各校同学，并分别牌示保护各文化教育机关。"

The original statement reads as follows: \"The Soviet Chief of Staff of the Allied Staff believes it is no longer possible to attend the Allied Staff meetings. This is because since Colonel Howley, the US Commander, refused to discuss the Soviet proposal to improve the material treatment and legal status of workers and staff in Berlin's industry and transportation at the Commander's meeting on June 16, and made some insulting remarks to the Allied Command and left the meeting, the Berlin Allied Command has effectively ceased operations. This rude behavior by the US Commander undermined the work of the Berlin Allied Command. Importantly, the US Command did not respond to the Soviet protest against Howley's unreasonable actions. Subsequently, the US, British, and French Commanders in Berlin, disregarding the fact that Berlin is located within the Soviet occupation zone and is an economically integral part of the Soviet occupation zone, issued a joint illegal order in the Western occupation zones of Berlin, circulating new currency from the Western occupation zones in Berlin marked with the letter \"B\".

Comrade Leng Chu of the District Party Committee gave a report at the meeting, pointing out that under the leadership of the Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese revolution will soon achieve victory on a national scale. He briefly described the history of the Party's 27 years of development and growth, and pointed out that everyone should carefully study and accept the Party's historical experiences and lessons, and study the line and policies, to better ensure the victorious guidance of the Chinese revolution. He then gave a detailed explanation of the three specific tasks of war, production, and Party rectification. Regarding the continued implementation of Party rectification, he said: Comrades who have performed well after rectification must be commended, and those who have been improperly punished or whose conclusions are incorrect should be corrected; those who continue to develop their mistakes should be criticized. He particularly pointed out the necessity of strengthening organization and discipline at the present time. Finally, he called on everyone: In order to welcome the arrival of national victory and to better realize the Party's current tasks, all organizations should launch an in-depth policy study movement: (1) In the study, it is necessary to determine the plan and steps for achieving improved work from the perspective of clarifying the connection between the overall task and the specific tasks of one's own department. (2) Review the results of rectification, and consolidate and develop them, to better transform oneself ideologically, organizationally, attitudinally, and in terms of work attitude. (3) It is necessary to seek improvement in working methods and overcome the bureaucracy and narrow-minded empiricism that exist in current work.\n    [Another dispatch] Around \"July 1st,\" the streets of Shijiazhuang were extremely active.

In the same period, 1,794 state farms will be electrified, so that all state farms in the Soviet Union will be fully electrified at that time.

Electricity will be supplied by small-scale hydroelectric power plants, which will be built on local riverbanks or lakeshores. To this end, approximately 20,000 kilometers of rivers are being surveyed. Vocational schools will train 14,000 electrical engineering personnel to manage rural power plants. Universities and specialized schools will prepare thousands of experts for rural electrification. Since the beginning of this year, 600 power stations have been set up in collective farms. This year alone, 4,000 power stations will be built for collective farms. The power stations are built by the collective farm peasants themselves.

In its resumption statement, the strike committee called on workers to continue launching movements to oppose the unjust punishment imposed by the British government on eleven workers who refused to transport zinc oxide. This strike gave British reactionaries a great warning. Not only were the workers not deterred by their threats, but the strike in London expanded to the western British port of Liverpool on the 28th, greatly shaking the British government. The British King immediately declared a \"state of emergency in Britain\" that night, and the Attlee government invoked the Emergency Powers Act to suppress the strike. According to this act, Attlee could dispatch large numbers of soldiers to various ports to unload goods, and could forcibly requisition people's houses, vehicles, equipment, etc., to transport and store goods. This act had only been adopted once before, twenty-two years ago, by the Conservative government to suppress the national general strike, a move that made the Conservative government notorious at the time. This time, the Labour government's panic-stricken action made members of the British House of Commons \"feel astonished\" (Associated Press). In the House of Commons, this action was not only criticized by Communist MP Gallacher, \"but also strongly opposed by some Labour MPs\" (Agence France-Presse). Liverpool Labour MP Mrs. Braddock said: \"It is ominous for a Labour government to use emergency laws against strikers.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: TASS reported: Pravda published an article on the 3rd commenting on the British dockworkers' strike, stating: The dockworkers' strike shows that the British working people are now departing from the so-called \"time-tested\" trade union leadership (referring to the leadership of reactionary trade unions). The course of this strike greatly surprised the British bourgeoisie and its Labour Party servants. The workers have lost their trust in worker \"leaders\" like Deakin (General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union) and increasingly believe that the Labour Party leaders in the trade unions are defending the interests of the bourgeoisie rather than the interests of the working class. The emergency measures taken by the Labour government have not thwarted the fighting spirit of the workers. The strikers have indeed resumed work, but in an organized manner and in accordance with the resolutions of the strike committee they organized themselves. Although the Labour government is celebrating \"victory\" amid the cheers of the Conservative Party, their joy has been marred because they know that the struggle will continue and the state of emergency will remain in effect for another month.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英码头工人罢工委员会　号召工人继续斗争\n\n1948-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英码头工人罢工委员会\n    号召工人继续斗争\n    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报导：坚持了十六天之久的伦敦码头工人的罢工，已于六月三十日自动复工。罢工委员会在其复工声明中，号召工人们继续发动运动，以反对英政府加于十一个拒运氧化锌工人的不公正处罚。这次罢工给了英国反动分子一个很大的警告。工人们不但没有被他们的威胁所吓退，而且，伦敦的罢工于廿八日扩大到英国西部大港利物浦一带，这就大大的震动了英政府。英皇于当夜立即宣布“英国处于紧急状态”，艾德礼政府乃引用紧急权力法案来镇压罢工。根据这一法案，艾德礼可以派遣大批士兵去各港口卸货，可以强迫征用人民房屋、车辆、装备等去运输及存积货物这一法案只在廿二年以前曾一度为保守党政府所采取，用来镇压过全国总罢工，此种举措在当时曾使保守党政府声名狼籍。这次工党政府如此惊惶失措的行动，使得英国下院议员们也“觉得惊异”（合众社）。在下院中，这一行动不但受到英共议员加拉彻的抨击，“而且受到某些工党议员的强烈反对”（法新社）。利物浦工党议员布拉多克夫人说：“一个劳工政府使用紧急法案反对罢工者是不详的。”\n    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社讯：真理报于三日撰文评论英国码头工人的罢工称：码头工人的罢工表明，目前英国劳动人民正离开了所谓“久经考验”的工会领导（按指反动工会的领导）。这次罢工的经过，使英国资产阶级及其工党仆役大为吃惊。工人们已丧失了对狄金（运输及各业工人工会总书记）之流的工人“领袖”的信任，并日益相信，工会中工党领袖们是在卫护资产阶级的利益而不是卫护工人阶级的利益。工党政府所采取的紧急措施，没有挫折工人们的斗争精神，罢工者固然是复工了，但是是有组织的，而且是遵照自己所组织的罢工委员会的决议的。虽然工党政府正在保守党的欢呼中庆祝“胜利”，然而他们的欢乐却已受创，因为他们知道斗争将继续进行，紧急状态仍要保持一个月。"

    "content": "Column: Inquiries and Replies\n\n　　To help readers study and solve difficult problems in their work, this newspaper has opened an \"Inquiries and Replies\" column to facilitate joint research and promote work.\n    　　　　Refunds for Wrongfully Accused Industrial and Commercial Entities Should Be Handled According to Actual Circumstances.\n    Comrade Editor:\n    Regarding the matter of refunds and compensation for wrongly accused industrial and commercial entities mentioned in our newspaper, I have a question. I am Li Desheng from Lishui Village, Seventh District of Xingtai. In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), I rented a water mill from the landlord Zhang Linjian in Yingtou Village, paying an annual rent of forty yuan. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the river washed away nine sections of the mill shed, and the remaining thirteen sections were silted with over four feet of sand, rendering it unusable. I was going to return home and suffer! But when I went to inform the landlord Zhang Linjian, he told me not to leave yet, and that he would repair it after autumn. When I went to ask him to repair the house in the autumn, he was ill and had no money. He told me to repair it myself and he would pay for it after it was done. At the time, I was very worried. I had no money to repair it, but if I didn't, there would still be a debt. So I sold one and a third mu of land and borrowed money from all sides, spending over nine hundred workdays, using completely new lumber. When the water mill was repaired, I went to settle the account with him, but he had already died, and I received nothing. The water mill was unusable, and his son, Zhang Taiyuan, came to the mill, not mentioning the repair, and even wanted to increase the rent, resulting in another expenditure of seventeen hundred yuan. During the land reform the winter before last, the former Yingtou Village struggled against this mill without my involvement, but during the movement, after research by the district government, the water mill was allocated to me. Now the house is leaking a bit, and last winter I bought a beam and over two hundred jin of lime to repair it, but I heard that wrongly accused industrial and commercial entities are being refunded, so I haven't proceeded with the repairs. Should this be refunded or not? Please provide an answer.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　Asked by Li Desheng, written by teacher Shen Wanzhao\n    Comrade Shen Wanzhao, forwarded to Comrade Li Desheng: It is the Party's policy that wrongly accused industrial and commercial entities should be refunded. However, in the specific implementation, it is necessary to distinguish the specific circumstances, and not simply refund across the board. As you mentioned, the water mill you operate belongs to the landlord Zhang Linjian, but after it was damaged, you spent your own money to repair it, and the original owner did not pay you the repair costs as agreed. In principle, it should not be simply returned, but should be handled according to the actual situation. The repair costs you added, etc., converted into capital, should belong to you. We believe that the leading organs can work with both parties to resolve this through consultation.\n　　　　　　　　　\n　　Editor\n    　　　　Should the Masses Still Receive Dividends from Returned Factories?\n    Comrade Editor:\n    There is a Yuxing Iron Factory in Nanmenli, Handan City. During the land reform, because it had shares held by a traitor, it was confiscated jointly by the masses of Nanmenli in this city and Xidatun in Handan County. After the confiscation, it was simply converted into mass shares, without distribution, and continued to operate. After the correction work, we believe that this factory, except for the shares of the traitor which should be confiscated, should be returned to the original owners.\n    Xidatun heard the news and wants to distribute the factory's profits. Moreover, the militia captain of Xidatun, relying on his power, often borrows money from the factory for private transactions, and recently wanted to borrow money again. An accountant sent by his village was unwilling to lend it to him (because more than 40,000 yuan borrowed previously had not been returned), so he used the power of the peasant association to criticize the accountant, saying: \"I am a cadre, and also a poor peasant, how dare you not lend me money?!\" This frightened the accountant. The accountant said, \"I am just an ordinary person, and he is a cadre, I dare not argue with him in the future.\" Recently, the director of the peasant association was sent to settle accounts and distribute profits. There are also reports saying that the cadres of Xidatun are unwilling to return wrongly accused households, and the masses want to return them, but the militia captain insists on not returning them. The masses of Xidatun dare not speak up, for fear of trouble. In this situation, I feel that the militia captain of Xidatun should conduct a deep self-criticism, and the county leaders should pay attention to education and transformation. Furthermore, should the masses still receive dividends from merchants who are to be returned? Please answer this question from the newspaper (I don't think they should). Yue Qifeng, Handan City Bureau of Industry and Commerce.\n    Comrade Yue Qifeng: According to the instructions of the former Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region of the Chinese Communist Party on the industrial and commercial policy: \"Strictly prohibit the liquidation and struggle of industrial and commercial entities, and protect all industrial and commercial entities (including landlord and rich peasant industrial and commercial entities).\" Therefore, this Yuxing Iron Factory, except for the traitor's shares which should be confiscated by the government, the private shares of the factory should be returned to the original owners. The newly invested capital during the period of mass operation should be converted into capital and established as mass shares. As for the issue of profit distribution, we believe that the profits during the period of mass operation can be settled by the masses, according to the general labor-capital profit distribution ratio, the capital's share should be given to the original owners, and the labor's share should belong to the masses. If new shares have been added after the mass operation, the capital's share of the profits can be distributed according to the share ratio. The militia captain's act of borrowing money by virtue of his power is wrong regardless of who operates the factory, and his superiors should persuade, educate, and supervise him to correct it.\n　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n    　　　　If Furniture Deposited by Foreign Merchants is Sold, the Money Should Be Returned.\n    Comrade Editor:\n    I am currently working on the return of industrial and commercial entities in Pengcheng according to policy. I have encountered a difficult problem and would like you to answer it in the newspaper:\n    In the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), there was a businessman from Ji County in Pengcheng's Xinhua Street. He came to Pengcheng at the age of fifteen to learn business, working as a shop assistant. With the salary he earned, he bought some shelves and furniture, and partnered with another person to open a business. In the 29th year (1940), fearing harassment by the Japanese Gendarmerie, he closed down the business, consolidated and stored the furniture, and went elsewhere to work as a shop assistant to make a living. However, during the \"Three Checks\" and the clearing of village finances last July and August, the furniture he stored was cleared and sold for money, which was used as village financial income.\n    But the person came yesterday to ask for the return of his furniture, saying that he wanted to open a business again. Our opinion is that it should be returned to the original owner, but the furniture has already been sold, and the money is still stored in the cooperative. There are several other foreign merchants in the same situation. How should it be handled and compensated? Please reply. Li Fengtai, Pengcheng Market Administrator.\n    Comrade Li Fengtai: As you described the situation, the furniture and shelves of this merchant from Ji County should be returned. Although the furniture has been sold, the money is still stored in the cooperative, so the proceeds from the sale should be returned to him so that he can resume business. Other foreign merchants in the same situation should be treated the same way. What do you think? If there are any problems in the implementation, please raise them again for discussion.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 询问与答复\n\n1948-07-09\n第2版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　询问与答复\n    为帮助读者研究与解决工作中的疑难问题，本报特辟“询问与答复”一栏，以便共同研究，推进工作。\n    　　　　退还错斗工商业应按实际情形处理编辑同志：\n    咱报上说的过去斗争了工商业要退还补偿，我有个圪＠。我是邢台七区梨水村人，我叫李德生。民国二十五年赁下本区营头村地主张林建一座水磨，每年出赁价四十元。民国二十八年被河水冲了磨棚共九间，其余十三间也淤了四尺多深的沙，这样就不能干了。回家受苦吧！但去交代房主张林建时，他说叫我暂时不要走，等到秋后他给修盖。到秋后去找他修房时，他病了，也没钱。他叫我修吧，修起后，用多少他给拿。当时我很发愁，修吧没钱，不修吧还有笔帐，于是便卖了一亩三分地，东抓西借，修好共用了九百多工，完全是新买的木材。水磨修好了去找他算帐时他已死了，分文没给。水磨不能干了，他儿张太员找到磨上，修房的事一字没提，还要增加赁价，结果又花了一千七百元。前年冬土改，前营头村把这磨没我经手即斗争了，而到运动时，经区府研究，又把这座水磨批给我了。现在这房有些漏，去冬买下一架梁，二百多斤石灰，准备修补，但听说斗争了工商业退还哩，就不待修补了。象这还退不退，请解答。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　李德生问、教员申万兆代笔\n    申万兆同志转李德生同志：错斗工商业应予退还，这是党的政策。但具体执行起来，就要分别具体情况，不能笼统一声退还了事。如你所说，你所经营的水磨虽系地主张林建所有，但在损坏后，你自己曾经出钱修建，原主又未依约付给你修建用过的钱，按理这不应简单退回，应按实际情况处理。你所加进去的修建费等折成资本均应归你所有。我们认为可由领导机关协同你们双方以协商办法解决。　　　　　　　　　\n　　编者\n    　　　　应退还的工厂群众是否还应分红？编辑同志：\n    邯郸市南门里有个裕兴铁工厂，在土改中因有汉奸的股子，被本市南门里和邯郸县西大屯的群众共同没收啦，没收后仅仅转作群众股份，没有分配，继续营业。纠偏工作下来后，我们认为这个工厂除汉奸股子没收外，其他应退还原主。\n    西大屯听说这个消息，就要把这个工厂的红分了。并且西大屯的民兵队长仗着势力，在工厂经常借钱，作私人买卖，最近又要借钱，他本村派来的一个会计不愿借给他（因以前借的四万多元还没还），他就借用农会的势力，给这个会计提意见，说：我是个干部，也是贫雇，你敢不借给我！？这样一来把会计吓坏啦，会计说咱是个百姓，他是个干部，今后可不敢给人家上劲。最近又派农会主任来，叫结帐分红，并有反映说：西大屯的干部不愿退错斗户，群众思想愿退，但民兵队长主张不退。西大屯的群众不敢吭声，怕出差。象这样的情形，我觉着西大屯民兵队长应作深刻的检查，县的领导上应注意教育改造。再者，决定退的商户，群众是否还应分红？请报社答复一下（我觉着不应分）。邯市工商局岳歧峰。\n    岳歧峰同志：根据前中共晋冀鲁豫中央局关于工商业政策的指示中：“严格禁止清算斗争工商业，保护一切工商业（包括地主富农工商业在内）”的决定，这个裕兴铁工厂除了汉奸股份应由政府没收外，该工厂私人股份应该退还原主。而在群众经营期间所新投入的资本，则应转成资本，订成群众股本。至于分红问题，我们认为在群众经营时期的红利可由群众结算，按一般劳资分红比例，资方所得给原业主，劳方所得归群众，若群众经营后又增添新股，则可按股份比例分配资方所得红利。民兵队长仗势借钱问题，不管工厂由谁经营都是不对的，应由其上级说服教育监督改正。　　　　　　　　　　　——编者\n    　　　　外商寄存家具如被变卖，应将款项退回编者同志：\n    我现在彭城作依政策退还工商业工作，发现一件难事请在报上答一下：\n    在民国二十五年，彭城新华街有一个冀县商人，十五岁来到彭城学生意，当店员，以自己挣的薪津，买了些货架子与家具等，与另外一个人合伙开了一个生意，二十九年因日本宪兵队欺讹，害怕收拾停业了，把家具归并寄存起来，就到别处给人家当店员为生。但在去年七八月中三查与清理村财政时，就把他存的家具等清理变卖成钱了，作为村上财政收入。\n    但本人昨天来要求退还他的家具，并说他自己要开门再干。我们的意见是应该退还原主的，可是家具已经变卖了，钱还在合作社存着，象这样的外商还有好几户，究应如何处理和赔偿，请答复为盼。　　　　彭城市场管理员李凤台\n    李凤台同志：如你所说情况，这个冀县商人的家具货架是该退还的，家具虽已变卖，但钱仍存合作社，则应将变卖款项退回，以便他恢复营业。其他同样情况的外商也应同样处理，不知你们意见如何？执行中有什么问题，望再提出研究。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　编者"

Not long after the battle ended on the 22nd, more than 500 students went to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, requesting to be escorted to North China University to study. The PLA unit gave them a warm reception and held a get-together before their departure. At the meeting, the students all recounted the terrorist persecution by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and expressed their long-cherished desire to study and participate in revolutionary work in the liberated areas. A student from Kaifeng High School said that until the liberation, students at the school were still being arrested. Many of these students were forced onto the front lines as expendable victims by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and suffered persecution from Chiang Kai-shek's indiscriminate bombing. At the same time, they personally witnessed the People's Liberation Army's care for the students, thus strengthening their belief in going to the liberated areas. After the joint enrollment announcement of North China University and other schools in the liberated areas was posted on the 24th, the registration office in front of Drum Tower Street was crowded with young male and female students all day long. They came to register with suitcases and bedrolls on their backs. A water conservancy engineer sent his seventeen-year-old son to register; a civil servant tearfully insisted on sending his daughter, who had been injured in a bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, to the liberated area to study. Many students ran away from home to register. Two students left letters to their loved ones, saying that they were \"going to pursue the light\" and hoped that they would follow them. Many young professionals, such as post office clerks, shop assistants, engineers, and teachers, also came to register to participate in work and study in the liberated areas. Teachers and students from Luoyang Middle School, Luoyang Normal School, Qinyang Middle School, Yancheng Middle School, and Xuchang Middle School, who had been coerced into moving to Kaifeng, also returned to the western Henan liberated area in large numbers to study and teach. When the People's Liberation Army withdrew from Kaifeng, there were still more than a hundred young students carrying luggage, determined to follow the People's Liberation Army to the liberated areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 追求光明参加革命工作　开封千余学生到解放区  很多职员店员工程师教员也纷纷报名\n\n1948-07-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　追求光明参加革命工作\n    开封千余学生到解放区\n    很多职员店员工程师教员也纷纷报名\n    【新华社开封前线七日电】开封市区各大中学青年学生大批前往解放区后方求学，前后已达一千余人。二十二日战斗结束不久，即有学生五百余人到解放军某部，要求护送至华北大学求学。该部解放军当予热烈招待，临行前并举行联欢会。会上学生都倾诉蒋匪特务的恐怖迫害，和希望到解放区学习与参加革命工作的宿愿。开封高中一学生说，直到解放前，该校尚有学生被捕。这些学生中有不少是因这次亲历蒋匪强迫上火线作牺牲品和遭蒋机滥炸的迫害；同时又亲自看到解放军对学生的爱护，因而坚定了他们前往解放区的信念。二十四日解放区华北大学等校联合招生布告贴出后，鼓楼街报名处门前整日拥塞青年男女学生，他们提着箱子、背着被包，前来报名。有一个水利工程师把自己一个十七岁的儿子送来报名；一个公务员流着眼泪，坚决要把已被蒋机轰炸负伤的女儿送到解放区求学。很多学生瞒着家里跑来报名。有两个学生留信与爱人告别说自己“追求光明去了”，希望她们也跟上来。很多职业青年如邮局职员、店员、工程师、教员也纷纷前来报名，参加解放区工作和学习。被胁迫迁往开封之洛阳中学、洛阳师范、沁阳中学、郾城中学、许昌中学等各校师生，此次亦大批返回豫西解放区求学和任教。当解放军撤离开封时，尚有百余青年学生背负行李，坚随解放军来解放区。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army used on-the-spot Party admission in the battle of Lalatun, southeast of Changchun, to promote an army-wide upsurge in support of the Party, thereby creating a completely new atmosphere in the company.\n\n　　Before the Lalatun battle on May 24th, the political commissar of the regiment announced the higher authorities' call for on-the-spot Party admission. When the troops stopped pursuing and awaited orders on the front line, the company political instructor of the 10th Company immediately called on the platoon and squad cadres to report their battle achievements. It was discovered that Yin Wenxuan, a soldier of the 9th Squad of the 3rd Platoon who had previously requested to join the Party, had performed outstandingly in this battle. After working with the deputy squad leader and soldiers in his group to eliminate the enemy's bunker and capture twelve prisoners, he charged into the courtyard alone. After the branch and the commendation committee reviewed Yin Wenxuan's daily work and pre-battle determination, they believed that he met the requirements for Party membership and immediately announced the approval of his on-the-spot Party admission at a general meeting of soldiers of the entire company, which was unanimously supported by the soldiers. Other companies in the battalion were also very excited when they heard the news.\n\n　　Before the battalion carried out on-the-spot Party admission, the company branch had openly held Party Days (one day per week was designated for educating Party members or conducting group activities) during the military rectification movement, so that non-Party soldiers and Party member soldiers could attend Party lessons together. The branch also specifically assigned Party members to contact non-Party members and cultivate candidates for Party membership. The Party's prestige in the company was extremely high; non-Party members generally yearned to join the Party, but many were concerned that their own conditions were not sufficient and were unwilling to make a public expression. After Yin Wenxuan's on-the-spot Party admission, everyone's confidence immediately increased. For a time, a warm atmosphere of supporting the Party was created throughout the battalion. 174 people signed up to request on-the-spot Party admission, 68 people were determined to become combat heroes, and 38 people were determined to become solo heroes. Now, the soldiers are no longer satisfied with battlefield commendations, but regard being a Communist Party member on the front line as the supreme honor.\n\n　　After this movement was launched throughout the entire unit, it raised the consciousness of Party members, promoted a wave of competition among soldiers, and generally formed a conscious and spontaneous work style in the company. Alternate Party member Sun Xiangyi was determined to surpass Yin Wenxuan's battle achievements in the next battle. Jiang Xuefeng, a model Party member of the 8th Company, became the target of everyone's challenge, and everyone regarded him as the standard for on-the-spot Party admission. At the same time, the soldiers also realized that to be admitted to the Party on the front line, it was not only necessary to have courage in battle, but also to have skills and excellent work performance in peacetime. Therefore, during wartime, they automatically dug fortifications, built bunkers, came up with ideas, seized gaps to automatically train troops, and practiced siege warfare; in peacetime, they competed to stand guard, actively helped each other, and the relationship between officers and soldiers was closer than before, and the spirit of class friendship was greatly developed. Currently, the company is organizing on-the-spot Party members into groups, with the group leader responsible for individual education, conducting reviews every week, and specifically helping them to progress and meet the requirements for Party membership.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北解放军某部　用火线入党的方式推动全军拥党热潮\n\n1948-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北解放军某部\n    用火线入党的方式推动全军拥党热潮\n    【新华社东北八日电】解放军某部在长春东南之拉拉屯战斗中，以火线入党的方式推动了全军拥党的热潮，连队气象因而焕然一新。\n    该部某营于五月二十四日拉拉屯战斗前，由团政委宣布了上级关于火线入党的号召。当部队停止追击在火线待命时，十连连指导员即号召班排干部汇报战功，发现过去要求入党的三排九班战士尹文铉在这次战斗中，于协同副班长和本组战士解决敌人地堡、俘十二名后，又只身冲入大院，战绩优异。支部和评功委员检查了尹文铉平日的工作和战前决心，认为符合入党条件，当即在全连军人大会上宣布批准他火线入党，当获军人大会一致拥护。该营其他连队闻讯后，也都十分兴奋。\n    该营未进行火线入党前，在整军运动中连队支部即曾公开举行党日（每周规定一日，进行对党员的教育或小组活动等），使非党员战士和党员战士在一起上党课；支部并具体分配党员联系非党员，培养发展党员的对象。在连队里党的威信极高；非党员，一般都渴望入党，但多顾虑自身的条件不够，不愿作公开表示。尹文铉火线入党后，立即增加了大家的信心。一时全营造成了热烈的拥党空气，报名要求火线入党的有一百七十四人，决心做战斗英雄的有六十八人，做独胆英雄的有三十八人。现战士们已不满足于战场记功，而以能在火线上作一个共产党员为无上光荣。\n    这一运动在整个部队中开展后，提高了党员的自觉精神，推动了战士之间的竞赛热潮，普遍形成连队中自觉、自动的作风。候补党员孙相倚决心在下次战斗中超过尹文铉的战功；八连模范党员姜学风成为大家挑战的对象，大家都以他作为火线入党的标准。同时，战士们并认识到要火线入党，不仅凭着战时的勇敢，而且还要有技术以及平时优良的工作成绩。因此在战时自动挖工事，修地堡，想办法，抓住空隙自动练兵，演习攻坚战；在平时则互争站岗，积极互助，官兵关系亦较前密切，阶级友爱的精神大为发挥。目前连队对于火线入党的战士进行编组，由小组长负责个别教育，每星期进行检讨，具体帮助他们进步，达到入党的条件。"

Comrade Li Xuefeng of the Central Plains Bureau reported on the significance of the meeting. He briefly explained the birth and struggle of the Communist Party of China, pointing out that since the Chinese people could defeat Japanese imperialism, they would certainly be able to repel the aggression of American imperialism, overthrow the traitorous rule of Chiang Kai-shek, and achieve national victory. Finally, he announced that the Party Central Committee recently decided to strengthen the leadership of the Central Plains Bureau in order to continue to develop the People's Liberation War and completely liberate the Central Plains, increasing the members of the Central Plains Bureau and determining the candidates for the Standing Committee and Secretary. Subsequently, Comrade Deng Zihui, Deputy Political Commissar of the Central Plains Military Region, explained in detail the Party's general line and general policy, and emphasized that every Party member and revolutionary fighter must study and implement Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's entire line and policies.

    "content": "Several Problems in Yuanshi's Production and Disaster Relief Work\n    Zhan Chao\n\n    Except for the first and second districts in the west, most of Yuanshi County is newly liberated. Due to the long-term devastation by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, a severe spring famine was caused this year. In March of the solar calendar, the number of people without food in the county reached more than 25,000, accounting for about one-sixth of the total population. However, under the leadership of our Party and government, the county's masses launched a production self-salvation movement, and finally victoriously overcame the spring famine. Not only did they achieve the goal of \"no one starving to death, no land left uncultivated,\" but many people also bought production materials such as livestock and agricultural tools during the production self-salvation process.\n\n    What problems did the county encounter in its production and disaster relief work, and how were these problems solved? The following is a summary report of the initial investigation and research.\n\n    　　　　I. Why Do Cadres Disregard Production and Disaster Relief Work?\n\n    Initially, county and district cadres generally disregarded this work. Whoever was asked to do it was unhappy, saying, \"The higher-ups look down on us! First-class cadres engage in equal distribution, and they call us second-class cadres to engage in production!\" Some even said, \"Going home to be a civilian is not shameful!\" They focused their attention on the eight Party rectification and land reform experiment villages and were indifferent to the growing famine.\n\n    Why did this phenomenon occur? The main reason was that the leadership initially did not pay enough attention to this work. At the beginning of March, when county and district cadres completed their reorganization and were assigned tasks, the county Party committee announced the decisions of the district Party committee and the Central Bureau that before the spring plowing, the focus would be on supplementing Party rectification and promoting democracy, and once the spring plowing arrived, all efforts should be devoted to production, with production as the center. Although production and disaster relief were mentioned at the same time as the land reform key experiments, the actual tasks assigned were centered on the land reform key experiments. In terms of the allocation of forces, many key cadres were concentrated in a few land reform experiment villages, and those sent to investigate the disaster situation were mostly cadres who had not participated in the reorganization. They themselves had many ideological problems and naturally could not complete the investigation tasks well. Therefore, the county Party committee did not have a good understanding of the disaster situation below. This phenomenon continued until the poverty-stricken peasant training class in the Sixth District on March 15.\n\n    The initial purpose of running the training class was to attempt to unite the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village through the trained poor and lower-middle peasants, and strive to complete all the new district land reform work before the wheat harvest. However, this policy contradicted the masses' demand for production. Once it was proposed, it was resisted. The poor and lower-middle peasants generally reflected, \"Today we are here listening to the Land Law, and tomorrow there will be no rice to cook at home!\" After investigation, in the 23 villages of the entire Sixth District, with 4,817 households, 1,012 households were currently short of food (i.e., had nothing to eat), accounting for 21% of the total number of households in the district. In villages with severe disasters, the proportion was even greater, such as Dongfu Village, with a total of 83 households, 28 households were currently short of food, accounting for more than 34% of the total number of households in the village. At the same time, the poor and lower-middle peasant training class in the Chengguan District also raised this issue, which made the county Party committee deeply realize the seriousness of this year's spring famine and the importance of paying attention to the season when arranging work. Therefore, on the one hand, it sounded the alarm to cadres throughout the county, and on the other hand, it began to take the following measures: (1) Reduce the number of land reform experiment base villages (starting with eight, first reduced to seven, and then to four), and draw out some strong cadres to participate in the production and disaster relief work team; (2) Put forward the slogan: \"Whoever neglects production and disaster relief will commit a crime,\" demanding that all cadres mobilize and strive to achieve the goal of \"no one starving to death, no land left uncultivated.\"\n\n    　　　　II. Paternalistic Relief or Production Self-Salvation?\n\n    After solving the cadres' idea of ​​disregarding production and disaster relief, a new problem was immediately encountered, that is, whether to adopt a paternalistic relief policy or a production self-salvation policy? At the beginning, many cadres were afraid that the disaster-stricken households would not be able to control themselves, waste the grain and money at once, and have nothing to provide relief in the future, thus creating a paternalistic phenomenon. For example, the staff of the Huayuan in Chengguan District distributed five taels of rice per person per day to 14 poor peasant households; while Laixiang Village distributed relief grain equally according to the population and land area of the entire village, stipulating that those with an average of one mu of land or less per person would receive three he of rice, those with one to two mu would receive two he of rice, and those with more than two mu would receive one he of rice… The result of paternalistic relief was that relief grain and loans, which could have solved some problems, failed to play their due role. Contrary to paternalistic relief was mobilizing the masses for production self-salvation. For example, Zhang Laoheng, a middle peasant in Fucun Village, Sixth District, was blind and had no labor at home. When the enemy bandits were there, he sold all his furniture due to excessive burdens. After the New Year, the children picked locust beans and pulled soybeans to mix with bran for food. Later, when the locust beans were gone, the whole family went begging. This time, he was loaned 117 catties of grain and 10,000 Jichaos to help him with production self-salvation. His family was very enthusiastic and immediately carried out division of labor: Zhang Laoheng held the child, the older children hoed the ground and picked up firewood, and the two women spun cotton. They spun an average of one catty of cotton (market weight) per day, earning 500 yuan (Jichaos), and each market day they could measure \"a small dou of sorghum, enough for the family to eat and drink, and now they have even planted the land, and there is hope for the autumn harvest. Another example is poor peasant Zhang Hengtai, who has five people and three mu of land, with a spinning wheel and a weaving machine. In the past, he only had two bolts of cloth as capital and could not make it work. This time, he was loaned 30,000 Jichaos to use as capital for production self-salvation. Now he can produce three bolts of cloth every market day, earning 5,000 yuan. In addition to taking care of his family, he also has some surplus… The leadership immediately seized these vivid and concrete facts and widely educated the cadres and masses, overcoming the paternalistic views of the cadres and the psychology of waiting for relief among the masses, and launched a mass production self-salvation movement.\n\n    　　　　III. Who Says We Can't Overcome the Famine Without Moving the Middle Peasants?\n\n    Before the masses established a positive view of production self-salvation, one idea that coexisted with waiting for relief was the idea of ​​moving the middle peasants. Coupled with the cadres' one-sided views of the poor and lower-middle peasants and tailism, at the beginning of the production and disaster relief work, there was a strong trend that we could not overcome the famine without moving the middle peasants, and some biases arose from this. There are two specific manifestations: First, middle peasants are excluded when lending money; second, production materials such as livestock and vehicles of middle peasants are挪用随意 (arbitrarily used). For example, when poor peasants in Laixiang Village, Chengguan District, discussed loans, they not only did not allow middle peasants to participate, but also drove out the middle peasants who had already attended the meeting; Sizhuang Village, Fourth District, used the livestock carts of three well-off middle peasant households to transport grain, and all the money earned was given to the poor peasants (poor peasants who did not transport also received 6,000 Jichaos per person); Wang Chuangcheng, a militiaman in Gangwang Village, Sixth District, wanted to haul manure and asked the village chief to send livestock, and Li Qieshu, a member of the poor peasant group, also wanted to plow the land and also asked the village chief to send livestock. As a result, the village chief sent livestock to a middle peasant's home in a confused manner. The next day, the two went to pull the livestock and quarreled in front of the middle peasant's home. This middle peasant felt very embarrassed, felt that feeding the livestock and subsidizing the forage would not allow him to cultivate in time, and he had offended people… As a result, middle peasant households with difficulties did not have anything to produce to overcome the famine, and middle peasants who could maintain their lives were producing passively, affecting the development of the entire mass production self-salvation movement.\n\n    After discovering these biases, the county Party committee proposed \"Do not infringe on a single middle peasant household,\" requiring cadres throughout the county to correct their policy thinking, and uniting middle peasants in action by absorbing middle peasants to participate in production and disaster relief meetings, compensating middle peasants who have been damaged, and carry out production self-salvation together. Because the leadership was resolute and stipulated effective measures, such as dividing the enemy and puppet materials confiscated throughout the county at the time of liberation and the fruits of struggle preserved by the villages into two types: relief and loans (relief grain and money, focusing on giving to widowed and lonely disaster victims without labor, loaning grain and money focusing on people with production capacity but without living and production capital), adopting two methods of relief and distribution, and promoting and organizing the rational use of loans and grain loans in accordance with the spirit of production self-salvation. As a result, not only the negative phenomenon of restricting the middle peasants was curbed, but also social wealth was increased from a positive perspective. For example, seven villages in Chengguan District had 504 disasters and loaned a total of 11.41 million yuan (Jichaos, the same below), of which 158 households used 4,188,000 yuan to do small businesses; 158 households used 2,226,000 yuan for spinning and weaving; 83 households used 1,254,000 yuan to purchase agricultural tools; and 105 households used 3,742,000 yuan to buy livestock. The latter two items accounted for 43.6% of the total loans.\n\n    　　　　IV. How to Solve the Land Problem of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in the New Areas Where Land Reform Has Not Been Carried Out?\n\n    After breaking through the indifference to the famine, the leaders of Yuanshi vigorously organized the masses to carry out sideline production such as spinning, weaving, transportation, and small businesses, solving the urgent problem of the masses' food. However, in the early stage of the movement, not enough attention was paid to agricultural production, which made the mass production self-salvation movement unsustainable. When the spring plowing and planting came, this problem was raised. The new areas have not undergone land reform, and many poor and lower-middle peasants are still in a state of landlessness or land shortage. Therefore, how to properly solve the land problem of poor and lower-middle peasants in the production self-salvation movement became a central issue in Yuanshi's work at that time.\n\n    The methods they adopted at that time were two: One was to distribute the land initially mobilized last year to the poor and lower-middle peasants and the middle peasants lacking land for cultivation after a general evaluation, according to the average number, and finally determine the land ownership when it is equally divided in the future. One is to borrow land from landlords and rich peasants and distribute it to the poor and lower-middle peasants for temporary cultivation. In order to solve the particularly difficult problems of the poor and lower-middle peasants, when borrowing surplus land from landlords and rich peasants, a part of his wheat seedlings was borrowed as appropriate according to the situation, and the average number was taken care of during distribution, but only the right to use the land was determined, not the right to own it. A situation may occur here (and it actually happened), that is, the borrowed land may be large without going through the classification of classes; in this regard, the county Party committee emphasized \"borrowing the land of particularly obvious landlords and rich peasants first\" while proposing to borrow the surplus land of landlords and rich peasants, \"rather leak borrowing the land of ten landlords and rich peasants than mistakenly moving the land of one middle peasant,\" and in order to ensure the realization of this principle, specially organized cadres to study the classification of classes. As for whether the land ownership is determined or not, it is mainly a problem within the peasants and will be finally dealt with when it is officially divided in the future. For obvious landlords who have not been liquidated, it does not matter at all. While borrowing land from landlords and rich peasants, we widely carried out policy education among the masses, explaining that we would never move the middle peasants (if some places did, we would resolutely return and compensate), and called on everyone to devote all their efforts to production self-salvation and not wait for equal distribution. When determining the right to use the land, we announced \"whoever plants it will harvest it,\" stipulating that if middle and poor peasants cannot afford to raise seeds, they can find relatives and friends to help, or hire short-term workers. Those without labor can semi-plant or rent it out, and will never become a status because of this.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 元氏生产救灾工作中的几个问题\n展潮\n1948-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　元氏生产救灾工作中的几个问题\n    展潮\n    元氏县除西部一、二区外，大部是解放不久的新区。由于日寇和蒋家匪帮长期蹂躏，造成今年严重的春荒，阳历三月，全县断炊人数达二万五千余人，约占总人口六分之一。但经我党政领导全县群众展开生产自救运动，终于胜利渡过了春荒，不仅实现了“不饿死人，不荒地”的方针，许多群众还在生产自救过程中，买进牲口农具等生产资料。\n    该县生产救灾工作中遇到了一些什么问题，这些问题怎样解决的？就初步调查研究所得，摘要报导于后。\n    　　　　一、为啥干部轻视生产救灾工作？\n    最初县区干部普遍轻视这一工作，叫谁做谁就不高兴，说：“上级看不起咱！一等干部搞平分，叫咱二等干部来搞生产！”甚至说：“回家为民，不算丢人！”把眼光都集中在八个整党土改实验村上，对日益发展着的灾荒漠不关心。\n    为什么产生这种现象？主要原因是领导上开始对这个工作重视得不够，三月初县区干部整编结束布置工作时，县委虽宣布区党委和中央局的决定，春耕未到以抽补整党民主为中心，春耕一到，即应全力进行生产，以生产为中心；虽与土改重点试验同时提到生产救灾，而实际规定任务则以土改重点试验为中心。在力量的配备上，也是把很多主要干部集中在少数土改实验村里，派去调查灾情的多是未参加整编的干部，他们本身思想问题就很多，自然不能很好完成调查任务了。因此，县委对下面灾情不够了解。这种现象，一直继续到三月十五日六区贫雇训练班时才被打破。\n    当初开办训练班的目的，是企图经过受训练的贫雇回去串连村中贫雇团结中农，争取麦收前完成全部新区土改工作，但这个方针与群众要求生产相矛盾，一经提出，即遭到抵抗，贫雇普遍反映说：“今天在这里听土地法，明天家里还没有米下锅哩！”经过调查，全六区二十三个村，四千八百十七户，当下扣的（即没吃的）即达一千零十二户，占全区总户数百分之二十一，而灾情严重的村庄，比例更大，如东富村，共八十三户，当下扣者二十八户，占全村总户口百分之三十四强。与此同时，城关区贫雇训练班亦提出这一问题，这才使县委深刻认识到今年春荒的严重性以及布置工作必须注意季节重要性，于是一方面向全县干部敲起警钟，一方面开始采取下列措施：（一）减少土改实验基点村（开始八个，先减成七个，后减成四个），把若干强有力的干部抽出来参加生产救灾工作队；（二）提出：“谁要忽视生产救灾，就要造成罪恶”的口号，要求全体干部动员起来，为实现“不饿死人，不荒地”的方针而奋斗。\n    　　　　二、包办恩赐救济，还是生产自救？\n    解决了干部轻视生产救灾思想，马上又碰到一个新问题，就是采取包办恩赐救济方针，还是采取生产自救方针？开始，有不少干部怕受灾户掌握不住自己，把粮款一下子浪费了，将来没东西救济，因而产生包办恩赐现象，例如：城关区花园的工作人员，把救济粮每天每人按五两米发给十四户贫农；而来厢村更把救济粮按全村人口地亩平均分配，规定一口人平均一亩地以下的，发三合米，一亩至二亩的，发二合米，二亩以上的，发一合米………。包办恩赐的结果，使本来可以解决一些问题的救济粮、贷款发挥不到它应有的作用。与包办恩赐相反的，就是发动群众生产自救。例如六区富村中农张老恒，是个瞎子，家中没劳力，敌匪在时因负担过重，把家具全卖光了，过罢年，小孩拾槐拉豆，掺糠吃，以后槐豆也吃光了，全家就去要饭，这次一下贷给他一百十七斤粮，一万元冀钞，扶助他生产自救，他家情绪很高，立即进行分工：张老恒抱小孩，大孩、二孩锄地拾柴，两个妇女光管纺花，每天平均纺一斤花（市秤），赚五百元（冀钞），每集即可量“小斗高粱，够一家吃喝，现在连地也种上，秋粮也有着落了。又如贫农张恒太，五口人三亩地，有纺花车一辆，织布机一张，过去只有两匹布的本钱，干不开，这次贷给他冀钞三万元，依这来作资本进行生产自救，现在每集能出三匹布，赚五千元，顾住家口外，还有点长余……。领导上即抓取这些生动的具体事实，在干部群众中广泛进行教育，克服干部中的包办恩赐观点与群众中等待救济的心理，掀起了一个群众性的生产自救运动。\n    　　　　三、谁说非动中农才能渡荒？\n    在群众没有树立起生产自救的积极观点之前，与等待救济并存的一个思想，就是动中农的思想，加以干部中片面的贫雇观点、尾巴主义，在生产救灾工作初期，大有非动中农不能渡荒之势，并且由此产生了一些偏向，具体表现有二：一、贷款时排挤中农；二、随意挪用中农牲畜、车辆等生产资料，例如城关区来厢村贫雇讨论贷款时，不仅不叫中农参加，还把已到会的中农赶出来；四区使庄村用三户富裕中农的牲口大车去运粮，赚的钱全部归贫雇农（不去运的贫雇，每人也分到六千元冀钞）；六区岗汪村民兵王闯成想拉粪，叫村长派牲口，贫农团委员李怯树要犁地，也要村长派牲口，结果因马虎都派到一家中农家里，第二天天明二人去拉牲口，当面争吵起来，这户中农在旁感到很为难，觉得喂牲口、贴草料，不能及时耕种，还得罪了人……致使有困难的中农户没有东西生产渡荒，能维持生活的中农生产消极，影响整个群众性生产自救运动的开展。\n    发现了这些偏向后，县委提出“不要侵犯一户中农”，要求全县干部端正政策思想，并用吸收中农参加生产救灾会议、补偿受损害的中农，在行动中团结中农，一块进行生产自救。由于领导上坚决，并规定有效措施，例如将全县解放时缴获的敌伪物资，以及各村保存的斗争果实，分成救济与借贷两种（救济粮款，着重放给孤寡无劳力的灾民，贷粮款着重于有生产能力而无生活与生产资本的人），采取救济与发放两种方法，并且根据生产自救精神提倡与组织贷款贷粮的合理使用。结果不仅消极的制动中了农的现象，而且从积极方面增加社会财富。例如城关区七个村五○四灾，共贷款一一四一万元（冀钞，下同），用来做小买卖的一五八户，四一八八○○○元；用来纺织的一五八户，二二二六○○○元；用来购买农具的八三户，一二五四○○○元；用来买牲口的一○五户，三七四二○○○元。后两项，即占全部贷款百分之四三点六。\n    　　　　四、在未进行土改的新区，怎样解决贫雇土地问题？\n    元氏领导上打破了漠视灾荒之后，即大力组织群众进行纺织、运输、做小买卖等副业生产，解决了群众急不可待的吃饭问题。但在运动初期对农业生产注意是不够的，致使群众性的生产自救运动不能持久。待到春耕下种时，这问题便被提出来了。新区未经过土地改革，许多贫雇农仍处在无地少地的状态，因此，如何在生产自救运动中适当的解决贫雇农民的土地问题，便成为当时元氏工作中一个中心问题。\n    他们当时所采取的办法有二：一是将去年初步运动出来的土地，经过大体评议，按平均数分给贫雇及缺地的中农耕种，待将来平分时最后确定地权。一是从地主富农手中抽借土地，分发给贫雇暂时耕作。并且为了解决特别困难的贫雇困难，抽借地富多余土地时，酌量情况抽借他一部麦苗地，分配时照顾平均数，但只确定土地使用权，不确定所有权，这里可能发生（实际上也发生了）一种情况，就是未经过划分阶级，抽借地面可能大；对此，县委在提出抽借地富多余土地同时，就强调提出“先借特别明显的地主富农土地”，“宁漏借十户地富，不错动一户中农”，并为了保证这个原则实现，专门组织干部学习划阶级。至于地权的确定与否，主要是农民内部的问题，留待将来正式平分时最后处理。对于未被清算的明显的地主来说，是丝毫也没有什么关系的。与抽借地富土地同时，遂在群众中广泛进行政策教育，说明绝不动中农（有的地方动了，坚决退回与补偿），号召大家全力生产自救，不要等待平分。确定土地使用权时，宣布“谁种谁收”，规定中农贫农养种不过来的，可找亲戚朋友帮助，或雇短工，无劳力者可半种或出租，绝不因此而变成份。"

    "content": "Northern Yue Women's Expanded Cadre Meeting\n    Inspecting Production Leadership and Calling for Technical Learning\n\n    [Northern Yue News] The Northern Yue Women's Expanded Cadre Meeting revealed several production issues among women that urgently need to be addressed: 1. The voluntary nature of organization versus spontaneous drift. In previous years, the leadership called on the masses to organize and engage in labor exchange and mutual assistance, which indeed overcame many difficulties in individual production. However, many places committed the mistake of formalism. Some cadres subjectively prescribed complicated systems of work point recording, equal distribution, self-criticism, and reporting for the labor exchange groups, resulting in significant work-hour losses, which the masses saw as a burden. Some said, \"You mobilize for production every day, but you also cause a lot of trouble every day.\" Some people who actually participated in mutual assistance and labor exchange groups even kept it secret, fearing that cadres would come and impose rigid systems on them. Some comrades, failing to correctly recognize and correct their own commandism and formalism, mistakenly believed that all organization was necessarily formalistic and displeasing to the masses, and simply stopped advocating for organization altogether, allowing production to drift spontaneously. They did not understand that labor exchange and mutual assistance could solve many difficulties that individuals could not overcome in production and could improve production efficiency, etc. Therefore, overcoming formalism in production leadership on the one hand, and overcoming the idea of ​​spontaneous drift that rejects leadership on the other, has become an important issue in improving current production. 2. In the past, some places rigidly separated adult men from women and children to form labor exchange groups, causing some work that could have been done by women and children to be done by adults, wasting labor. 3. Women engaged in sideline production need loan support. Currently, the demand for women to develop sideline occupations in various places is very urgent, but many have stalled due to a lack of funds. When issuing loans, the care given to them is also very poor. If Hunyuan County can guarantee to exchange shoes for cloth, it can collect more than 20,000 pairs of shoes per month; but because this problem has not been resolved, shoes are made but cannot be sold, tying up capital, and most have stopped. 4. Among female cadres who are divorced from production, very few have production skills. Some who originally had experience have mostly forgotten it after coming out, or are unwilling to work again. It is difficult to achieve results by having people who do not understand production lead production; therefore, it is urgently necessary to educate female cadres to intensify their study of production knowledge and technology so that they can better lead the broad masses of women in production and avoid making mistakes of subjectivism and formalism.\n    (Pishan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳妇女扩干会　检查生产领导号召学习技术\n丕山\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳妇女扩干会\n    检查生产领导号召学习技术\n    【北岳讯】在北岳妇女扩干会上，发现妇女生产上有几个问题亟待解决：一、组织起来的自愿与自流。前几年领导上号召群众组织起来，拨工互助，确实克服了不少个体生产中的困难；但不少地方犯了形式主义的毛病。有些干部主观地给拨工组规定了复杂的记工、齐丁、检讨、汇报等制度，误工很多，群众视为负担。有的说：“你们天天动员生产，可是天天又给很多麻烦。”有些实际参加了互助拨工小组的人，因怕干部来给他们硬订制度，甚至保持着秘密。有些同志没有正确认识与纠正自己的强迫命令和形式主义，反错认为凡是组织起来，一定是形式的，群众不高兴的，就索性停止了对组织起来的倡导，一任生产自流。没弄清拨工互助可以解决个人生产中许多不能克服的困难，可以提高生产效率等等好处。因此，一方面克服生产领导上的形式主义。创造简单易行的组织办法，一方面克服不要领导的自流思想，就成为当前提高生产的一个重要问题。二、过去有些地方，硬把壮年男人和妇女儿童分开编组拨工，使一些本来可由妇女儿童做的工作也让壮年去做，浪费了劳力。三、妇女进行副业生产，须要贷款扶助，目前各地妇女开展副业的要求很迫切，多因缺乏资金而停顿着。贷款发放时，对她们照顾的也很差。浑源县如能保证以布换鞋，每月即可收鞋两万双以上；但因这个问题未解决，做了鞋卖不出，压住了本，大都停止了。四、脱离生产的妇女干部中，有生产技术的太少。原来有些经验的出来以后也多忘了，或不愿再劳动。以不懂生产的人来领导生产很难收效；所以急须教育女干部们加紧学习生产知识与技术，使能很好的在生产中领导广大妇女，不犯主观主义与形式主义的错误。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（丕山）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 7th. Shen Gongliang, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, has achieved outstanding results in uniting new soldiers and consolidating the troops. He was selected as a people's hero at the recent celebration meeting of the unit.\n\nHe served as a squad leader for more than a year. All the squads he led, some experienced fierce battles, and some were entirely composed of newly enlisted soldiers, but there were never any desertions.\n\nShen Gongliang's greatest characteristic in leading soldiers is his ability to understand the soldiers' psychology and to care for all his comrades from a true class feeling and a spirit of responsibility towards the revolution. He said, \"Our soldiers are the treasures of the revolution and should all be cherished.\" When the squad was about to be supplemented with newly liberated soldiers, Shen Gongliang took the initiative to discuss with the Party's group leader how to unite and educate them. He said, \"The new comrades do not know the nature of our revolutionary army, the Party must find ways to ensure patient education of the new comrades.\" Whenever he had time, he would convene group meetings to summarize the experience of consolidating the troops so that everyone could improve. He said to the old soldiers, \"The new comrades will all become old comrades in the future. Consolidating one more means adding one more point of revolutionary strength.\" He asked the old soldiers to automatically come up with ideas to unite the new soldiers. After the new soldiers came to the squad, he immediately convened a unity meeting, first having the old soldiers introduce their history to guide the new soldiers to introduce themselves. Then, based on the history of the new soldiers, different education was carried out. For example, the liberated soldier Miao Shilu had been a soldier in the Kuomintang army for more than ten years. Shen Gongliang asked him, \"What did the Kuomintang give you after ten years of being a soldier?\" Miao said, \"Empty hands.\" Then Shen Gongliang said, \"You see, you served the Kuomintang for more than ten years, and you were still hungry; but the People's Liberation Army soldiers, everyone defeats Chiang Kai-shek, and everyone divides the land to live a good life.\" He then introduced the situation in the liberated areas to Miao in detail. Miao Shilu said excitedly, \"Squad leader, don't worry, I am determined to work hard here and also be a good soldier of the People's Liberation Army.\" Liberated warrior Qi Bin was not used to eating millet and was in a bad mood. So the Party group discussed how to educate him, and then the deputy squad leader explained to him: \"The People's Liberation Army is the people's army, we eat what the people eat. If the people's lives have not been improved, we cannot eat and drink randomly, we must share the joys and sorrows with the people.\" Qi Bin understood this principle and quickly got used to it.\n\nUnder Shen Gongliang's exemplary leadership, the old soldiers were also able to care for the new soldiers in all aspects, such as helping the new soldiers carry backpacks and guns during marches. The new soldier Lin Zeru wore out his shoes halfway. Shen Gongliang immediately took out the shoes he usually saved and gave them to him to wear. During the march, everyone educated the new soldiers anytime and anywhere. For example, when living in the landlord's house, they explained to the new soldiers how the landlord exploited the peasants without working; when passing through the Yellow River flooded area caused by Chiang's army breaching the dikes, they explained Chiang Kai-shek's crime of flooding the people with water.\n\nWhen leading the newly enlisted soldiers, Shen Gongliang served as the education squad leader. He and the new soldier squad leader Ma Heshan were very united, did not put on airs, and discussed things with each other, so that Ma Heshan dared to take responsibility for doing things, and actively cultivated Ma Heshan's leadership ability. When the soldiers' families came to the army to visit the soldiers, he took care of them as if they were his own relatives. He said to the soldiers' relatives, \"You are like our parents, and your children are like brothers to us here.\" Four returning soldiers from other squads were assigned to Shen Gongliang's squad. Shen Gongliang was very kind to them; he first held a welcome meeting, inspiring and consolidating the revolutionary self-esteem of the returning soldiers. Under the principle and confidence that \"as long as they are educated, they can make progress,\" he transformed many soldiers and cultivated many backbones.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巩固部队模范　副排长沈公良\n\n1948-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巩固部队模范\n    副排长沈公良\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线七日电】华东解放军某部副排长沈公良，团结新战士和巩固部队成绩优异，在最近该部庆功大会上被选为人民英雄。\n    他曾担任班长一年多，凡他所领导过的班，有的经历过激烈战斗，有的全班都是新参军战士，但从来都没有发生过逃亡现象。\n    沈公良领导战士的最大特点，是能熟悉战士心理，并从真正阶级感情与对革命负责的精神出发去爱护全班同志。他说：“我们的战士是革命的宝贝，都应该爱护”。当班里要补充新解放战士时，沈公良就主动和党的小组长商量怎样团结教育他们，他说：“新同志不知道我们革命军队性质，党内要想办法保证对新同志耐心的教育”。有空他就召开小组会，总结巩固部队经验，使大家都能提高一步。他对老战士说：“新同志将来也都是老同志，多巩固一个，就多增加一分革命力量。”他要求老战士自动出主意团结新战士。新战士来班里后，他即召开团结会，先由老战士介绍自己历史，引导新战士作自我介绍。于是根据新战士历史，进行不同的教育。例如解放战士苗世禄，在国民党军里当了十多年兵，沈公良就问他道：“你当兵十年，国民党给了你什么？”苗说：“一只空手。”于是沈公良就说：“你看，你替国民党当兵十多年，还是要饿肚子；可是解放军战士，大家打垮蒋介石，大家分田地过好日子。”他随即把解放区的情形一一向苗介绍。苗世禄激动的说：“班长放心，我决心在这里好好干，也做解放军的一个好战士。”解放战争齐滨因不习惯吃小米饭，情绪不好。于是党的小组就讨论如何教育他，然后由副班长向他讲解：“人民解放军是人民的队伍，老百姓吃什么我们也吃什么。老百姓生活没有得到改善，我们就不能随意乱吃乱喝，要与人民共甘苦。”齐滨懂得了这个道理，从此就很快习惯起来了。\n    在沈公良以身作则推动下，老战士也都能从各方面关心新战士，如行军时帮新战士背背包、扛枪。新战士林泽如中途穿破了鞋子。沈公良马上把自己日常节余下的鞋子拿给他穿。行军中大家都随时随地向新战士进行教育。如住在地主家就向新战士讲解地主如何不劳动而剥削农民；行经蒋军决堤之黄泛区，就讲解蒋介石决堤水淹人民的罪行。\n    带领新参军战士时，沈公良任教育班长。他和新兵班长马合山非常团结，不摆老资格，有事互相商量，使马合山敢于负责做事，并积极培养了马合山的领导能力。战士家属到部队来看望战士时，他照顾得象自己亲人一样。他对战士亲属说：“你们就犹如咱的父母，你儿在这里和我们也象兄弟一样”。别班的四个归队战士编到了沈公良班上，沈公良对他们很和蔼；他先召开了个欢迎会，启发和巩固了归队战士的革命自尊心。在“只要教育都能进步”的方针和信心下，他改造了很多战士，培养了很多骨干。"

    "date": "1948-07-10",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 8th. On June 29th, the entire 39th Division of the Yan Army in Xin County advanced on Yancun (southwest of Xin County) and was decisively defeated by a unit of our local corps. More than 500 enemy soldiers were killed or captured, including enemy regiment commander Zhu Xuefan (killed). The amount of captured materials is still being inventoried.\n\n[This Newspaper Reports] Liang Peihuang, Xu Qichang, and other senior Yan army officers who were liberated, issued a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Jin Sui Army. The full text is as follows: Respected senior officers, old colleagues, old subordinates, and all officers and soldiers of the Jin Sui Army:\n\nWe were fortunate to escape disaster during the Linfen and Shouyang campaigns. After liberation, our daily life was sincerely and considerately cared for by the military and political leaders of the People's Liberation Army. After a short rest, we were sent to the PLA Officers' Education Corps to study Chinese issues. After arriving at the corps, we were treated as cadres, focusing on self-study with guidance. We could freely raise questions and discuss them to clarify right and wrong. Our personalities were not insulted in any way, so we were enlightened and felt happy. We are not made of wood or stone, how could we not be grateful? It was a blessing in disguise.\n\nRecalling our past, living in the mountains, we were ignorant and ill-informed. Mr. Yan (referring to Yan Xishan) rose in Jin Sui, initially advocating \"governing Jin by the people of Jin\", lingering in the era of the Northern Warlords. Later, he used the National Revolution as a banner to amass wealth from the people. Especially around the time of the July 7th Incident, he became arrogant and ignorant, unaware that there was a world outside of Shanxi. Therefore, he closed the door to build his own cart, advocating heresies, attempting to turn back the wheels of history and consolidate his bloody rule. Everything from \"material securities\" to \"distribution according to labor\", \"advocating fairness\", and \"integrating soldiers and farmers\" was nothing more than using pleasant words to cover up the counter-revolutionary essence of harming the people. Especially around the time of the December coup (i.e., December 1939), he fabricated the so-called slave philosophy of \"existence is truth, need is legitimate\", confusing the enemy and ourselves, deceiving the world, and even failing to distinguish between loyalty and treachery, killing meritorious people, colluding with Japanese invaders, and attacking the New Fourth Army. This was the epitome of outrageous and shameless behavior.\n\nNot only that, Mr. Yan's butcher knife was not only aimed at the people, but also at us, large and small military and political personnel, exhausting his brains to control us. Such as \"Iron Army\", \"Comrade Association\", \"Loyalty Guarantee\", all kinds of tricks and ugly performances, the intention is nothing more than knowing that his crimes are heinous, fearing that we will despise him, so a pair of bloody hands are pinching our throats. Everyone is in danger. In his eyes, there are no reliable subordinates, and among us, there are no trustworthy colleagues. Such a one-handed, self-disturbing behavior is only intended to make others bow their heads and be an earthen emperor opening a door from the roof.\n\nAlthough we have not yet seen the full picture of the specific implementation of the CCP's proposals and various policies in the liberated areas shortly after our liberation, the entire region, from the Party, government, military, and down to the people, are united as one. The military and civilians, officers and soldiers are united. The people have land to cultivate, food to eat, clothes to wear, work to do, and books to read. There are no thieves, no beggars, doors are not closed at night, and lost items are not picked up. The world of Yao and Shun has reappeared today! All landlords also receive the same share of land as farmers. Military and political cadres, veterans, and families of soldiers on expeditions are guaranteed their lives by law, without family concerns, without foreign privileges. Industry and commerce are developing upward. It is foreseeable that a poor and backward agricultural China will leap into a strong and wealthy industrialized country in the East.\n\nToday's situation in China is that the liberated areas, from Heilongjiang to the Yangtze River, are connected as one. The Chiang army in the Northeast only has isolated strongholds in Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou. Rehe only has the dead city of Chengde. Hebei and Shandong only maintain a few isolated islands in Pingjin, Jinan, and Qingdao. South of the Yangtze River, people's uprisings are springing up, and people's hearts are changing. Chiang Kai-shek's rule, which has always been proud of unifying China, is disintegrating and morale is low. After the failure of the \"consolidate points, connect lines, expand the surface\" defensive strategy, he is preparing to \"retreat to Liangguang\" and relies on Chennault's airlift as the only savior, relying on luck. Mr. Yan, who is about to die and is in a small place, is still reciting Chiang's myth of \"military occupation, people's consolidation, army defeat, people's elimination\" in Taiyuan shamelessly. His lack of self-knowledge is so great. Now that Linfen has fallen, what will happen to Taiyuan is self-evident to those who know the situation. Thus, it is self-evident to those who know the situation that the people will win and Chiang and Yan will lose.\n\nWe have received the cultivation of the people but do not know how to repay their kindness, instead helping Yan to do evil. Our hometown elders have been ravaged. Our towering crimes are countless. After liberation, we deeply realized that the present is right and the past is wrong. Looking back on the past, we feel ashamed. However, our old comrades are still lost and not awake. If we do not plan for them early, once the army approaches the city, there will be no complete eggs under the overturned nest. Every time we think about this, we can't help but feel sad. We offer our lessons and hopes to be able to turn back to good, make a decisive decision, and believe that the People's Liberation Army will certainly adhere to the broad policy and will not blame the past. We can be a lesson for the past, do not wait and see to mislead ourselves. The general trend is so, these words come from the heart. Where to go and what to do, choose wisely. Looking forward to your success!\n\nLiang Peihuang, former Lieutenant General Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Army Group, Xu Qichang, former Major General Division Commander of the 66th Division, Yi, former Lieutenant General Division Commander of the 49th Division, Liu Guangdou, former Lieutenant General Commander of the Jinan Garrison Area, Xi Anren, former Major General Senior Counselor of the 34th Army, Zhao Junyi, former Major General Deputy Division Commander of the 49th Division, Tang Jiamo, former Major General Deputy Division Commander of the 66th Division, Du Xuandao, former Colonel Chief of Staff of the 66th Division, Meng Changwei, former Colonel Political Director of the 66th Division, Su Fengji, former Colonel Branch Chief of the 37th Branch of the Supply Station, Gao Haifu, former Colonel Deputy Commander of the Linfen Garrison Area, Jia Zhengnai, former Director of the 12th Branch of the National Revolutionary Comrades Association, respectfully.\n\nJune 20th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 忻县西南我地方武装　击溃阎匪一个师  梁培璜等函促阎军官兵认清时局\n\n1948-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　忻县西南我地方武装\n    击溃阎匪一个师\n    梁培璜等函促阎军官兵认清时局\n    【新华社晋绥八日电】六月二十九日忻县阎军三十九师全部向我晏村（忻县西南）进犯，被我地方兵团某部击溃，毙俘敌团长朱学范（毙）以下五百余名，缴获正清查中。\n    【本报讯】被解放的阎军高级军官梁培璜、徐其昌等发出致晋绥军全体官兵书，全文如下：晋绥军老长官、老同僚、老部下与全体官兵钧鉴：\n    临汾与寿阳两次战役，我等幸免于难。解放以后，生活起居，均蒙人民解放军军政首长诚恳相待，关怀备至，稍事喘息。即先后送至解放军官教导团，从事研究中国问题。到团以后，生活按干部待遇，以自学为主，加以辅导，对疑难问题，均能自由提出讨论，辨明是非。对我等人格，丝毫未加侮辱，因而茅塞顿开，精神愉快，人非木石，能不感戴？因祸得福，此之谓也。\n    回忆我等过去居处山隅，孤陋寡闻，加以阎先生（指阎锡山）崛起晋绥，始则揭药晋人治晋，悠然于北洋之世，继以国民革命为标榜，囊括民脂民膏。而在七七事变前后，尤复夜郎自大，坐井观天，不知山西之外别有天地，因而闭门造车，倡为邪说，企图倒转历史车辆，巩固血腥统治。举凡“物产证券”也，“按劳分配”也，“主张公道”也，“兵农合一”也，无一不是以好听词句，掩盖其残民以误之反革命实质。特别在十二月政变（即一九三九年十二月）前后，捏造所谓“存在就是真理，需要就是合法”的奴隶哲学，敌我不分，玩世欺人，甚至不辨忠奸，残杀有功，勾结日寇，打击新军，此丧天害理，不知人间有羞耻事之尤者也。\n    不仅此也，阎先生之屠刀，不但砍在人民头上，而且对我等大小军政人员，亦绞尽脑汁，谋所以控制之道，如“铁军”也，“同志会”也，“忠贞保证”也，五花八门，丑态百出，揆其用心，无非自知罪大恶极，虑为我等所不齿，因而一双血手，捏着我等咽喉。谈虎色变，人人自危。在彼耳目中无一可靠之部属，而在我等相互间亦无一可信之同僚，似此一手遮天，庸人自扰之所为，不过企图别人俯首贴耳，做一个从房顶开门的土皇帝而已。\n    我等解放不久，对中共主张与解放区各种政策之具体实施，虽然尚未窥其全貌，但全区党政军上下团结一致，军民、官兵一致、人民有地耕、有饭吃、有衣穿、有工作、有书读，无盗贼、无乞丐，夜不闭户，道不拾遗，唐虞之世，复见于今日矣！所有地主亦分得农民同样一份土地，军政干部、荣誉军人、出征军人家属均有法律保证其生活，无家庭顾虑，无外国人特权，工商业向上发展，行见一个贫困落后的农业中国，将一跃而为东方工业化的强富之国。\n    今日中国局势，解放区由黑龙江到杨子江，连成一片。东北蒋军只剩沈、长、锦孤立据点。热河只有一个承德死城。河北、山东不过保持平、津、济、青几个孤岛。长江以南，民变蜂起，人心思变。素以统一中国自负的蒋贼统治尚且分崩离析、士气不振，在“固点、联线、扩面”的防御方针失败以后，又布置所谓“退守两广”的退却准备，而以陈纳德空运为唯一救星，靠天吃饭。行将就木、伏处弹丸的阎先生，还在太原大言不惭的背诵此人“军事占领、民众巩固、军队击溃、民众肃清”的神话，其不自量也如此。目前临汾已失，太原又将如何，不待识者而自知。如此，人民必胜，蒋阎必败亦不待识者而知之矣。\n    我等身受人民培养，不知怀德报本，反而助阎为恶，桑梓父老，蹂躏备至，滔天之罪，擢发难数。解放之后，深知今是而昨非，抚今思昔，惶愧莫名。然旧日袍泽，犹在沉迷不醒，倘不早为之图，一旦大军临城，复巢之下，必无完卵，每一念及，不禁惆然，爰本身受教训，略贡区区，望能回心向善，当机立断，相信人民解放军必然一本宽大政策，不咎既往，我等可为前车之鉴，勿再观望以自误。大势所趋，言出肺腑，何去何从，善为择之，临颖神驰，恭候勋祺！\n    前第六集团军中将副总司令梁培璜、前第六十六师少将师长徐其昌、前第四十九师中将师长翼、前晋南师管区中将司令刘光斗、前第三十四军少将高级参议席安仁、前第四十九师少将副师长赵俊义、前第六十六师少将副师长汤嘉谟，前第六十六师上校参谋长杜宣道、前第六十六师上校政治主任孟常威，前兵站三十七支部上校支部长苏逢吉、前临汾团管区上校副司令高海富、前民族革命同志会第十二分会主任贾正鼐合叩。\n　　　　\n　　　　　　　　　　　　六月二十日"

Since the beginning of spring, in order to prevent enemy disruption, the slogan \"Start early, rush to cultivate and plant\" has been put forward, and both young men and women have enthusiastically invested in agricultural production. Women activists like Qin Linzhuang, Sun Shuangxiu, Wang Efeng, and Zhao Yuting, who emerged during the land reform struggle, led 102 young women in participating in major labor tasks such as breaking up clods, hoeing field edges, spreading manure, sowing seeds, delivering manure, and carrying manure. Currently, they have taken up large hoes to weed the seedlings. Zhang Wuni, Gao Xiaomei, and Yang Guixiang have learned how to use seed drills and stone mills. They said, \"Now the women's minds have changed, and they know that labor is the way to succeed. In the past, Er You's wife suffered a lot in the fields, and others laughed at her, but now everyone wants to emulate her.\" Many women who used to only do light work such as spreading manure and pinching seeds have now taken on heavy work such as driving carts to deliver manure, carrying manure, and hoeing seedlings. Sun Sanxiu, Qin Linzhuang, Liu Fuyu, Liang Meifeng, Guo Wangyu, and more than 20 other women drove carts, delivering a total of 2,275 carts of manure, and 570 mu of land were cleared of clods and tree stumps through mutual aid and labor exchange, and 24 mu were planted with corn. Qin Linzhuang's family of three, with her husband away and her mother-in-law old, cultivated over ten mu of land entirely on her own. She used her labor to exchange for animal labor in the labor exchange group (one and a half units of human labor for one unit of animal labor) without relying on others, and planted all the land. Now, the weeding of the large fields is nearing completion. Sun Sanxiu has been working in the fields every day since the beginning of spring, and Zhang Lianmei leaves her child with her mother-in-law at home to work in the fields. All the land has been planted. When our army annihilated the Yan bandit Zhao Junyi's unit on May 1st, most of the men and livestock in the village followed the army to the front, and the women took on the task of taking care of the stationed troops. Under the active leadership of Qin Linzhuang and others, 64 young women and more than 30 children carried grain to the Zhonglan Village Grain Station, 12 li away, carrying 8,100 jin in three days, ensuring the supply of grain to the troops. Other women helped the troops sew and wash clothes. Many cadres and masses said, \"If it weren't for the women's active participation in production this year, the land would have been left barren. And if it weren't for the women's active carrying of grain this time, the troops' meals would have been affected.\" The village has a total of 41 hectares of land, and thanks to the women's active participation in agricultural production, the call to leave no land uncultivated has been realized.\n\n(Zhao Changcheng, Wang Fangming)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 担负农业主要劳动　郭村妇女积极生产\n赵长城　王方明\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　担负农业主要劳动\n    郭村妇女积极生产\n    【北岳讯】盂县郭村是个边缘区，入春以来，为了防止敌人扰乱，提出“提早下手，抢耕抢种”的口号，男女青壮年均热烈投入农业生产中。在土改斗争中的妇女积极分子秦林状、孙双秀、王俄凤、赵玉亭等，在生产运动中带领了一百零二名青壮妇女参加打圪垃、刨地边、散粪、撒种、送粪、担粪等主要劳动，目前已扛起大锄进行锄苗。张五妮、高小梅、杨贵香已学会了提耧踩磨。她们说：“现在妇女们心眼都转过来了，知道劳动就有办法。二有年老婆过去在地里受的强，别人都笑的不行，现在都想向她看齐了”。不少妇女过去只做散粪、捏种等轻活，今年已担负了赶车送粪、担粪锄苗等重活。孙三秀、秦林状、刘福鱼、梁梅凤、郭王鱼等二十多个妇女赶车，共送粪二千二百七十五车，互助变工打圪垃、刨楂子五百七十亩，种玉茭二十四亩。秦林状全家三口人，男人不在家，婆婆又老了，全家刨十几亩地，由她自己在变工组里以人工换畜工（一个半人工换一个畜工），没有用别人，全部种上，现锄大田已将结束。孙三秀从开春到现在，每天都在地里生产，张连梅把娃子给他婆婆留在家，也下地生产，地都种好了。当我军在五月一日围歼阎匪赵俊义部时，全村的男人和牲口大都随军上了前方，妇女们担负了招呼驻军的任务。在秦林状等积极带领下，六十四名青年妇女，三十多个儿童，到十二里远的中兰村粮站背粮，三天背了八千一百斤，保证了部队粮食的供给。其他妇女则帮助部队缝洗衣服。不少干部和群众说：“今年要不是妇女积极生产，地就得荒了，这次要不是妇女积极背粮，部队吃饭也会受点影响”。该村共有土地四十一顷，由于妇女积极的参加了农业生产，已实现了不荒一亩土地的号召。\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（赵长城、王方明）"

They also worked together to pull plows, roll the soil, and carry water to loosen the soil, helping the men sow seeds, planting 120 mu of rice in thirteen days. In Chen Huangfu and Yang Song villages in the First District, forty-seven women were organized, with twelve of them pulling plows and compacting the soil just like the men. With their efforts and assistance, the entire village completed the sowing of 617 mu of loosened soil in ten days. In Mengjiawu, in addition to participating in making bamboo mats, nets, and spinning thread in the groups, women also pulled seeders, plows, and provided rice seedlings. Relying on the participation of women, the entire village had completely finished sowing the 17 qing of loosened soil in May.\n\nPreviously, women in Xinji City, except for a small number who engaged in needlework due to financial difficulties, mostly did not participate in production. After the land reform, through the advocacy and education of the democratic government, women gradually began to work, participating in various productions such as spinning thread, spinning hemp, rolling cigarettes, and pasting boxes. Older women also inspected wool and cotton in felt workshops and mills. Currently, there are 1,700 people (including some outside the city) spinning thread by hand for the burlap bag factory, and more than thirty women working as net makers and bag sewers. More than 2,140 households (including some villages outside the city) are spinning thread for the Yonghe Towel Factory. In total, the number of women participating in labor in the city accounts for more than 80 percent of the female population. Song Duan, a woman from the First Street, earns a living for three people by spinning thread for the Yongsheng Factory. Li Da Ma from the Eighth Street supports her entire family of five by spinning thread.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 文新、辛集妇女大部参加耕作\n\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　文新、辛集妇女大部参加耕作\n    【冀中讯】文新、辛集市妇女积极参加农副业生产。文新有些村庄经常有水患，群众生活困难。大部要靠运销、捕鱼和其他副业来维持生活。今年水落后，为了突击水田，在政府的号召下，大部妇女都参加了耕作。五区张庄黄秀英等三家伙打了五个稻池，自己出秧自己栽，五天栽完十五亩；并合着拉耠子，挑耩水脱地，帮助男人下种，十三天种稻一百二十亩。一区陈黄甫、杨宋村组织起四十七个妇女，有十二人和男子一样的拉耠子砘地。在她们努力参加帮助下，十天种好全村水脱地六百一十七亩。孟家务的妇女除了参加组里打箔、网、纺线，并一样拉耧，拉耠子、出稻秧子。全村依靠妇女参加，在五月里已全部完成十七顷水脱地的下种。\n    辛集市妇女以前除一部分生活困难的做些针工外，大部不参加生产。土改后，经过民主政府的提倡和教育，妇女逐渐劳动起来，参加纺线、纺麻、卷烟、糊盒等各种生产。年纪大的也在毡坊、轧坊检毛检花。现在给麻袋工厂纺手工的就有一千七百人（内有市外一部），打络、缝袋的女工三十多人。给永和毛巾工厂纺线的有二千一百四十多户（包括市外村一部）。总计全市参加劳动的妇女占妇女人口百分之八十以上。一街妇女宋端给永生厂打线，能供养三个人。八街李大马靠打线养活全家五口。"

    "content": "Joint Appeal by the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee to Launch a Seedling Weeding and Fertilizer Application Campaign\n\n　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Currently, it is the good time for seedling weeding and fertilizer application. To increase grain production, the two regional governments have jointly issued a notice to all areas to carry out the campaign of weeding three times, applying supplementary fertilizer (milky green manure), and covering green manure. The summary is published as follows:\n\n　　(1) Although the weather was favorable in early spring this year, and the seedlings were growing vigorously, since the beginning of summer, there has been a drought. Because less fertilizer was applied, and most of it was quick-acting fertilizer, the fertilizer effect will have passed by the time of heading, which will affect the harvest and reduce production. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the campaign of weeding three times and applying supplementary fertilizer (milky green manure). This is the most effective way to increase production. All areas must seize the opportunity, make specific arrangements, and fully utilize various fertilizers. If necessary, agricultural loans can be issued to solve the difficulties of poor farmers in purchasing fertilizers.\n\n　　(2) Last year, due to drought and short grass, less green manure was covered in various areas, with many places reducing by about one-third. This year, the grass is thick, and all areas must do their utmost to mobilize and organize farmers to dig pits at the edge of fields, roadsides, and in pens to ferment manure. If some areas cannot dig pits, they can stack the various weeds into layers of grass and soil on sloping land to turn them into fertilizer. In mountainous areas with a foundation, the amount of green manure covered this year should exceed the achievements of 1944. In plain areas, the green grass used as fuel should be used for covering fertilizer to prepare fertilizer for wheat planting this autumn and next spring. Currently, it is the best season for covering fertilizer, and all areas must give this work an important position, organize and lead it, so as to achieve greater results. The masses should also be vigorously mobilized and organized to help military families who are poor and lack labor to cover fertilizer.\n\n　　(3) If there is any remaining uncultivated land in various areas, the masses should be mobilized to eliminate it under the principle of \"whoever plants it, harvests it.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会联合号召  开展锄苗补肥运动\n\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会联合号召\n    开展锄苗补肥运动\n    【本报讯】目前正是锄苗、压肥的好时候，两区政府为增产粮食，顷特联合通知各地开展锄三遍、上补肥、压绿肥运动，兹摘要刊载于下：\n    （一）今年虽春初风调雨顺，青苗茂盛，入夏以来，则感亢旱，普遍因施肥较少，且多为速效肥料，至抽穗时肥效已过，势将影响丰收，减低产量，故有开展锄三遍、上补肥（奶青）运动之必要。这是增加产量最有效的办法。各地须抓紧时机，具体组织，充分使用各种肥料。于必要时并可发放一部农贷，以解决贫苦农民购买肥料的困难。\n    （二）去年因天旱草短，各地压绿肥较少，有许多地方约减少了三分之一。今年草厚，各地要尽大力动员组织农民，于地头、道边、圈里挖坑沤粪。如有的地区不能挖坑，可以就坡地一层草一层土垛起来，使各种杂草变成肥料。山地有基础之地区，今年压绿肥数量要超过一九四四年之成绩；平原地区应将作燃料用之青草，用于压肥，准备好今秋种麦及明春之肥料。目前正是压肥最好的季节，各地须把这一工作提到重要地位，加以组织与领导，务使能获得较大之成绩。对贫苦无劳力之军属，并应大力动员与组织群众，帮助他们压肥。\n    （三）各地如尚有残存之熟荒，应在谁种谁收的原则下，发动群众消灭。"

This played a significant role in ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and protecting the safety of the people at that time. Now, the armed enemies in the interior of our North China Liberated Area have been basically eliminated, and the war has been led to the peripheral areas or enemy-occupied areas. The vast interior has been completely connected. It is no longer necessary to continue this pass system, but it restricts the movement of people and business activities, hindering economic development. For this reason, it is hereby ordered to abolish the pass system in all consolidated areas. Merchants and people are free to move and travel, and no troops, agencies, or organizations may obstruct them unless in accordance with the law. However, border areas should still pay close attention to preventing the activities of enemy spies and saboteurs. Those leaving the Liberated Area to go to enemy-occupied areas and those coming to the Liberated Area from enemy-occupied areas must still be inspected in accordance with the law and complete entry and exit registration procedures and obtain entry and exit permits. All those who have already obtained exit or entry permits are allowed to freely exit or enter the country without further restrictions.

The Loujiapuzi Village in Zhangzhuang District, Yiyuan (newly established county, northern Yishui), Shandong Province, which suffered the most from the Chiang Kai-shek disaster, organized women to participate in agricultural and sideline production, successfully overcoming the spring famine and completing the spring plowing, summer weeding, and summer planting work. The administrative village includes the three natural villages of Wazi, Longwo, and Tumenyu, with a total of 132 households. At the beginning of the spring plowing, 90 percent of the village had nothing to eat. The Party branch proposed: \"Rely on women to engage in sideline occupations to earn food, and men make a concentrated effort to cultivate.\" Thus, 162 women were mobilized to engage in spinning and making military shoes. In two months, they earned more than 10,500 catties of wage grain, solving the problem of food for most of the people. After the spring plowing, there was a gap between the old and new crops, and the disaster situation became serious again. At this time, there was an urgent need to transplant seedlings and weed, but the wages for making shoes and spinning fell, and the income was no longer sufficient to solve the problem of food. The branch convened a meeting of party members to study how to continue earning food without delaying weeding. Everyone believed that the only way was to squeeze out male labor for transportation and odd jobs. However, after calculation, all the male labor was not enough even for weeding. There was no other way but to mobilize women to go downhill to weed. After discussion, female Party member Lou Chengju proposed to guarantee that she would go downhill herself and replace her brother to engage in sideline occupations. After further deliberation after the meeting, Wang Shenghui's group of young women, Lou Cheng’gui, Lou Cheng’xin, and others, also organized themselves. Led by experienced old farmers, they went downhill to weed. They earned 30 catties of grain a day. This achievement influenced the women of Wazi, who also organized seven people under the leadership of village cadre Fang Guiying to go downhill. The whole village quickly developed to thirteen women participating in mutual aid. Most of the women in Longwo initially emphasized that they could not go downhill because they had children, but after seeing Fang Dongyu and other four people in the village go downhill, they also organized themselves to go downhill. In this way, a total of 43 young and middle-aged women in the entire administrative village participated in mutual aid teams. The women and children of Wang Shengde's and Yang Chenggong's groups weeded more than 70 mu of seedlings in three days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沂源娄家铺子　妇女下坡锄地\n\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沂源娄家铺子\n    妇女下坡锄地\n    【新华社华东六日电】鲁中沂源（新设县，沂水北部）张庄区遭蒋灾最重的娄家铺子村组织妇女参加农业和副业生产，胜利渡过春荒，并完成春耕、夏锄、夏种工作。该行政村包括洼子、龙窝、土门峪三个自然村，共一三二户。春耕开始时，全村百分之九十的人没有吃的，党的支部便提出：“靠妇女搞副业挣饭吃，男人突击耕种”。于是动员了一百六十二个妇女投入纺织和做军鞋，两月中共赚工资粮一万零五百余斤，解决了大部吃粮。春耕后，青黄不接，灾情又形严重。此时急需剜苗、锄草，而做鞋、纺织工价跌落，所得已不足解决口粮。支部就召开党员大会，研究如何能继续挣饭吃而又不耽误锄地，大家认为只有挤出男劳动力搞运输、打短工。但是经计算后，所有男劳力仅锄草还不够用。除动员妇女下坡锄地外别无办法。经讨论后当时妇女党员娄承菊便提出保证自己下坡，替出她的哥哥去搞副业。又经会后酝酿，王胜惠组青年妇女娄承桂、娄承馨等七人也组织起来，由有经验的老农带着下坡锄地。他们一天就挣了三十斤粮。这一成绩影响了洼子妇女也在村干部方桂英带头下组织了七人下坡，全村并很快就发展到十三个妇女参加变工。龙窝大部妇女起初强调有孩子没法下坡，看到该村方东玉等四人下坡后也都组织下坡。这样全行政村共有四十三个青壮妇女参加变工组。王胜德、杨成功两组妇女、儿童三天中即锄苗七十余亩。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th. The great project of rebuilding dikes and closing breaches in the Kailu section of the West Liao River in the northeastern part of Rehe Province, which lasted for half a year, was successfully completed on June 17th. The 100,000 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of farmland in that section, which was flooded last year, has now been restored to fertile land. The West Liao River originates in the mountainous area of Rehe. When the river flows to Sujiabao, 90 li west of Kailu City, it turns from northeast to due east. Because the river carries a lot of sand, there is a lot of silt accumulation. It also washed out a river channel to the northeast, flowing into the Xin'kai River. During the puppet Manchukuo period, an attempt was made to close the breach at Sujiabao, blocking the washed-out river channel. In August 1945, the Japanese invaders, in an attempt to use water to prevent the Soviet Red Army from advancing south, disregarded the lives and deaths of the Chinese people and dug open the blocked breach at Sujiabao. When the river rose sharply last year, the floodwaters overflowed through this breach, flooding an area of more than 500 li, covering Kailu, the northern part of Tongguo, and the southern part of the East Middle Banner, affecting 100,000 hectares of farmland. Last November, the democratic government mobilized civilian laborers to build a temporary breach closure and a 1,200-meter-long dam at the breach to prevent this year's spring floods. From February to April of this year, 60 li of river dikes were repaired, and temporary river dike breaches were urgently repaired four times, safely weathering the spring floods. In May, the construction of a 1,600-meter-long dam and diversion dam was officially started, and a solid bank protection project was built in front of the dam. In total, the entire project lasted 160 days, with 353,120 workdays. The puppet Manchukuo's Sujiabao breach closure project was only 800 meters long and took three years to complete, while this breach was half as large again as the puppet Manchukuo's breach closure, and the entire breach closure project was completed in less than half a year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 热省西辽河开鲁段　复堤堵口巨大工程历时半年胜利完成\n\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　热省西辽河开鲁段\n    复堤堵口巨大工程历时半年胜利完成\n    【新华社东北七日电】热河东北部的西辽河开鲁段复堤堵口的巨大工程，前后历时半年，已于六月十七日胜利竣工。该段去年遭受水淹的十万垧（每垧十亩）耕地从此又恢复成为良田。西边河起源于热河山地，流至开鲁城西九十里苏家堡处，河流自东北折向正东；因河水沙多，淤塞甚多，又向东北冲开一条河道，流入新开河。伪满时曾在苏家堡进行堵口，将冲开的河道堵塞。一九四五年八月，日寇企图用水阻止苏联红军南下，乃不顾中国人民生死，挖开苏家堡堵口。去年河水猛涨时，大水即经此决口泛滥，淹没开鲁、通过北部及东科中旗南部达五百余里，受灾耕地十万垧。去年十一月民主政府即动员民工在决口处修筑临时堵口及拦河坝一千二百米，以防止今年春汛。今年二月至四月，又修补河堤六十里，抢修临时河堤决口四次，安然渡过了春汛。五月正式修筑拦河坝及调水坝共一千六百米，并于坝前修筑巩固护岸工程。总计全部工程历时一百六十日；施工三十五万三千一百二十个，伪满时苏家堡堵口工程仅长八百米历时三年始完工，而此次决口较伪满堵口时增大一半，不到半年即全部完成堵口工程。"

    "content": "[Hebei South News] Many villages in Jing County have experienced cattle plagues. The county government convened a county-wide veterinary symposium on June 11 to study methods for treating and preventing cattle plagues. After three days of discussion, it was generally agreed that the main causes of cattle plagues were dry weather, malnutrition, and drinking cold water immediately after work, which would trap heat inside, leading to a damp-heat syndrome that would then develop into dysentery, making treatment difficult. Based on this etiology and practical treatment experience, the following treatment and prevention methods for cattle plagues are proposed:\n\n(1) Symptoms and Treatment of Cattle Plague\n\n1.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 8th: The Northeast Daily published an editorial on the 27th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party on July 1st, entitled \"Unified Will, Unified Action, Unified Discipline,\" stating: The recent instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on strengthening the unified will, unified action, and unified discipline of the entire party to strive for national victory are extremely timely and important for the Northeast Liberated Area. Today, East, West, South, and North Manchuria have been united into one, and are also united with Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning. We have 42 million people, control 230 cities, more than 8,000 miles of railways, and many modern light and heavy industries and mines. The enemy is divided and blockaded, with only 34 enemy-occupied cities remaining in the Northeast and Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning area. The combat methods of our army have also developed from relatively small-scale mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare to large-scale siege warfare and mobile warfare. At the same time, land reform has been basically completed in eight or nine tenths of the Northeast Liberated Area. The reactionary rule of landlords, rich peasants, and feudal forces has been overthrown, and their reactionary armed forces and various bandit groups within our basic areas have been eliminated. Various constructions in the Liberated Area have a preliminary foundation. Under this situation, the basic task of the entire Northeast in the future is to further organize all manpower and material resources into a unified force, vigorously develop agricultural and industrial production, increase our material strength, improve the lives of the people in the Liberated Area, and meet all the needs of large-scale troop concentration operations on the front lines. In the past, the various necessary decentralization and permission of more local autonomy to each unit that we had to implement. If we still stick to the old ways and remain unchanged, it will become something that hinders the development of the situation, weakening our own strength and benefiting the enemy.\n\nThe editorial pointed out: The Northeast Party, even in the past, was basically centralized and unified. Without this basic condition, it would not have been possible to have today's favorable situation in the Northeast. However, even in the past, there were still many places in the Northeast Party where centralization was lacking where it should have been, and unification was lacking where it should have been. This situation is particularly serious at present. In order to strengthen unified centralization in the future, the first requirement is that the entire party implement strict unification in various policies and strategies. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the centralized unification of organizations and systems. Thirdly, it is necessary to strengthen the concept of law-abiding. The editorial reviewed the various shortcomings that existed in the Northeast in the past based on these three aspects, pointing out that these states of non-centralization and non-unification caused extremely great damage to the interests of the revolution. The editorial proposed: At present, it is necessary to conduct extensive and profound education throughout the Party and the army in the Northeast. Every comrade should carefully and seriously study and learn based on the Central Committee's reprinting of Chapter 2 of \"Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder\" and the Propaganda Department's \"Preface,\" based on Chairman Mao's and the Central Committee's instructions on this aspect, and in connection with examining their own thinking and work style, resolutely struggle against localism, departmentalism, empiricism, and guerrillaism that hinder unification and centralization, and resolutely struggle against all disorganization, indiscipline, and anarchy.\n\nThe editorial also pointed out: Unifying thinking is still our main method for transforming the old ideas, old work styles, and old habits in many comrades. However, it is not enough to rely solely on the method of unifying thinking. We must also use the Party's discipline and the government's laws to guarantee the unity of will and unity of action of the entire Party and the entire army. Enforcing discipline and law is essentially a kind of education. Today, we must first cultivate a strict discipline and a spirit of public service and law-abiding within the Party. Without this, we will not be able to lead the people's revolution to final victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 统一意志，统一行动，统一纪律。\n\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：东北日报七一社论\n\n　　统一意志，统一行动，统一纪律。\n    【新华社东北八日电】东北日报于“七一”中共诞生二十七周年纪念，以“统一意志，统一行动，统一纪律”为题，发表社论称：中共中央最近关于加强全党统一意志，统一行动与统一纪律以争取全国胜利的指示，对东北解放区来说，极为及时，极为重要。今天，东西南北满已经联成一片，与冀察热辽也已联成一片。拥有四千二百万人口，掌握二百三十座城市，八千多里铁路与许多近代化的轻重工业和矿山。而敌人则被分割被封锁，东北与冀察热辽敌占城市仅剩三十四座。我军的作战方法亦由比较小规模的运动战、游击战发展到大规模的攻坚战、运动战。同时东北解放区十分之八九的地区土地改革已经基本完成，地主富农封建势力的反动统治已被打倒，他们在我基本地区内的反动武装，各色各样的土匪队伍已经肃清。解放区的各种建设已经有了初步的基础。在这一形势下，今后全东北的基本任务，就是把一切人力物力进一步组织为统一的力量，努力发展农业生产与工业生产，增加我们的物质力量，改善解放区人民的生活，与满足前线大兵团集中作战的一切需要。过去我们曾不能不实行的各种必要的分散，和允许各单位更多的地方自治权。现在如果仍然墨守成规，一成不变，就会变成阻碍形势发展的东西，以致削弱我们自己力量，有利于敌人。\n    社论指出：东北的党即使在过去基本上也是集中的与统一的，没有这个基本条件，就不可能出现有今天东北的有利局面。但东北党即使在过去，应集中而不集中，应统一而未统一的地方也还很多。这种情形到目前就尤其感到严重。今后为加强统一集中，首先就要求全党在各种政策与策略上实行严格的统一。其次要加强组织与制度的集中统一。再其次是加强守法观念。社论根据这三方面检讨了过去东北所存在的各种缺点，指出这些不集中不统一的状态，给予革命利益的损害极为巨大。社论提出：目前需要在东北全党全军进行广泛深刻的教育。每个同志都应根据中央重印“左派幼稚病”第二章和中宣部的“前言”，根据毛主席和中央关于这方面的指示文件，认真严肃地加以研究学习，并联系检查自己的思想作风，坚决与那些妨碍统一与集中的地方主义、本位主义、经验主义、游击主义等作斗争，并坚决与一切无组织、无纪律、无政府状态作斗争。\n    社论又指出：打通思想，这仍然是我们转变许多同志中的旧思想、旧作风、旧习惯的主要方法。但仅仅靠打通思想的办法，是不够的。我们还必须以党的纪律与政府的法律，来保证全党全军意志的统一和行动的统一。执行纪律与法律实质上就是一种教育。今天我们必须首先要在党内养成纪律严明的风气，奉公守法的精神。没有这，我们就无法领导人民革命达到最后胜利。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 8th: As Chiang Kai-shek's troops are constantly defeated on all fronts, anxious Americans' reprimands of Chiang Kai-shek have reappeared in American bourgeois newspapers. According to a Washington dispatch: American \"military commentator\" Major George F. Eliot published an article on June 29, carried by various American newspapers, commenting on the Kuomintang's military situation. He said dejectedly: Chiang's \"military situation is deteriorating.\" \"With each victory, the Communists strengthen in numbers, supplies, and morale; while with each defeat, the government forces lose a considerable amount of manpower, supplies, and morale.\" The article then went on to scold its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek, saying: \"Regarding the absolute incompetence of the current Chinese government and its military leaders in dealing with the Communists, what could be clearer than this performance?\" \"What is there to say about a military and political leadership that has squandered such an absolute military advantage to date?\" The commentary also reprimanded He Yingqin, saying: \"It should be pointed out that General He Yingqin himself, who once served as Chief of Staff and is now the Minister of National Defense, has greatly contributed to this incompetence.\" Although American imperialists understand very well how to reprimand their lackeys, they cannot find a way out for their lackeys. In the article, Eliot reiterated the old tune of asking Chiang to \"change his strategy,\" but immediately said without confidence: \"Even if the strategy is changed, it is doubtful at present whether the Chairman can still fully control the army and the Chinese people to help him salvage this situation.\" Note: In the past two years, Washington and the U.S. military advisory group in China have repeatedly asked Chiang Kai-shek to \"change his strategy,\" suggesting that Chiang take this or that method to deal with the People's Liberation Army, but all have failed to save Chiang Kai-shek's defeat, but instead have deepened Chiang Kai-shek's military confusion. What is there to say about American imperialism itself?\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军各战场连打败仗　美反动派又斥蒋介石无能\n\n1948-07-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军各战场连打败仗\n    美反动派又斥蒋介石无能\n    【新华社陕北八日电】由于蒋军不断地在各战场打败仗，心情焦灼的美国人对蒋介石的训斥，又出现在美国资产阶级的报纸上。据华盛顿讯：美“军事评论家”乔治·Ｆ·伊利奥特少校于六月二十九日发表了一篇为美国各报登载的评论国民党军事形势的文章，他沮丧地说：蒋的“军事形势每况愈下”，“共产党随着每一次胜利，即在人数、物资及士气上加强；而政府军则随着每次失败，丧失相当规模的人力、物资及士气”。该文继即呵责其走狗蒋介石道：“对于中国现政府及其军事领袖在对付共产党上，这般绝对无能，还能有什么比这表现得更明白的呢？”“对于迄今为止耗掉这般绝对军事优势的军事政治领导机构，还有什么可说的呢？”该评论也训斥了何应钦说：“应该指出：曾作参谋总长现又任国防部长的何应钦将军本人，曾大大助长了这一无能”。美国帝国主义者虽然很懂得如何训斥它的奴才，但是却并不能为其奴才找出一条出路。伊利奥特在该文中，又重弹要蒋“改变战略”的老调，但马上又毫无信心的说：“即使是改变战略，委员长是否仍能充分控制军队与中国人民，以帮助他挽救此一形势，在目前尚可怀疑”。按：在过去两年中，华盛顿及驻华美国军事顾问团曾屡次要蒋介石“改变战略”，向蒋建议采取这样或那样的对付人民解放军的方法，但皆未能挽救蒋介石的失败，反而加深蒋介石在军事上的混乱。这对美国帝国主义自己，又有什么可说的呢？"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th: The four major key levee projects on the south bank of the Yellow River along the Hebei-Shandong border, namely Gao Village and Liu Village in northeast Dongming, Zhukou in northwest Heze, and Linpuji west of Juancheng, have been repeatedly sabotaged since February this year by Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Juancheng, Heze, and Dongming, and by bandits and special agents under their direction. The construction materials collected by our Yellow River Conservancy Commission Repair and Defense Office along the river in preparation for repairs have also been repeatedly robbed and burned. Now that the Yellow River flood season has arrived, each key project faces a dangerous situation. Due to the destructive crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, millions of people in Henan and Shandong are facing the danger of a serious Yellow River flood. The situation of Chiang Kai-shek's troops destroying various important key projects is described as follows:\n\nThe Jiangsu Dam of the famous Linpuji key project was severely damaged three times on February 24-25, March 17, and April 15. The ice-protection piles (wooden piles placed in the water to protect the dike slope, 12 feet long, 8 piles per row) of the second, third, fourth, and fifth dams were cut down by 80 rows in the first instance, and another 150 rows were cut down the second time. Approximately 1.1 million catties of accumulated straw material was burned, and 40,000 catties of straw material, 510 hemp ropes, more than 8,000 catties of hemp skin, 18,000 wooden piles, and a large quantity of wood were robbed. 17.8 cubic meters of stone material was thrown into the river. Seventy large fishing piles (each weighing 30 catties) on the old second dam were also cut and thrown into the river, causing both the new and old second dams to sag. (The phenomenon of a dam or dike slope sinking is called sagging. After sagging, the dam or dike slope may be washed away, and the Yellow River water will directly strike the riverbank, causing a breach.) In the first half of April, Chiang Kai-shek's entire 68th Division and the puppet Juancheng Brigade attacked our repair workers four times in succession, forcing us to suspend work. Since May, Chiang Kai-shek's entire 55th Division has been harassing the dam daily with small units, and has also built bunkers on the old second dam, dismantling many wooden piles. On May 12, they also robbed 210,000 catties of straw material that we had stored in Juntun (north of Juancheng).\n\nThe Gao Village key project was also continuously sabotaged twice by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in late February. Twenty important iron ropes on the seventh dam were cut. After we repaired it, a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division invaded the area again on April 16, cutting ten iron ropes and throwing them into the river. On April 19, nine armed Chiang Kai-shek plainclothes men destroyed the willow piles of the fourth dam and threw them into the river, cutting all the iron ropes and hemp ropes of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh dams. The seventh dam immediately sagged, and the water overflowed the dam by three Chinese inches. While our Repair and Defense Office was preparing to repair it, the enemy from Dongming occupied Gao Village, making it impossible for us to start construction, resulting in 15 meters of the dike slope of the seventh dam being washed away. At the end of April, willow bundles more than a foot long from that dam were found washed downstream. On April 21, 60,000 catties of straw material stored in the village were robbed. On May 12, Chiang Kai-shek's 55th Division robbed another 40,000 catties of straw material from the dam of the key project. At the same time, on April 20, our material transport boat, the Laojuntang, upstream of Gao Village, was also burned by Chiang Kai-shek's troops.\n\nThe Zhukou and Liu Village key projects were sabotaged by the enemy in the first half of April, and all the iron ropes and hemp ropes on the dike slopes were cut and thrown into the river. On April 21, 4,000 catties of willow bundles stored in Liu Village were also burned. All the above four major key projects have been severely damaged, and Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been constantly bombing and strafing along the river, hindering our emergency repair work. Since the beginning of spring, according to incomplete statistics, 56 of our dike workers have been killed or injured in bombings and strafing. The key projects on the south bank have been damaged and are in an unrepairable state, with continuous sagging and dangerous situations occurring.\n\n[Ji Luyu Telegraph] The Dong'a and Hexi Armed Work Teams, Small Teams Two and Nine, covered the emergency repair and transport of stone boats, repelling multiple incursions by an enemy five times our size. At 8:00 AM on the 21st, our stone transport contingent arrived at Wangkoushan, Henan (belonging to Pingyin), from a certain location to transport stone. The armed work teams occupied the Liushantou area for vigilance. More than 250 men of the 5th Security Brigade of the enemy in Dong'a, Liuhequan, and other places, with six machine guns, suddenly launched an attack on us in four directions. Zhang, a cadre of the Dong'a Armed Forces Department, and Captain Jing led their teams in courageous resistance, resolutely blocking an enemy five times our size. Two enemy planes also intruded into the airspace above the stone transport ferry at this time, strafing wildly. Our Section Chiefs Xin and Gu braved the enemy's bullets and worked hard with the boatmen to sail the boats back to the north bank. After 40 minutes, the armed work teams, seeing that the transport boats had returned to shore, withdrew in separate directions. The enemy planes continued to bomb, harassing us up to nine times a day, but fortunately, our stone transport boats had been dispersed and hidden, and were not damaged.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军破坏黄河险工　千百万人民正面临黄灾危险东阿等县武工队掩护抢险击退敌进犯\n\n1948-07-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军破坏黄河险工\n    千百万人民正面临黄灾危险东阿等县武工队掩护抢险击退敌进犯\n    【新华社华北六日电】黄河南岸冀鲁界上的四大河堤险工，即东明东北的高村、刘庄，菏泽西北的朱口及鄄城以西的临濮集，自今年二月以来即迭遭盘踞鄄城、菏泽、东明的蒋军及其指使的匪特破坏。我黄委会修防处运集沿河一带准备修险之工料亦迭遭抢劫、焚毁。现黄河大汛期已届，各险工险象环生。由于蒋军的破坏罪行，豫、鲁千百万人民正面临严重黄灾的危险。现将蒋军破坏各重要险工情形，分述如下：临濮集著名险工的江苏坝，于二月二十四日至二十五日，三月十七日、四月十五日被连续三次大破坏。该处第二、三、四、五坝的凌排桩（下于水中掩护堤埽的木桩。长丈二，八根一排）第一次被砍去八十多排，第二次又被砍去一百五十排。积存秸料被焚毁约一百一十万斤，被抢去秸料四万斤、麻绳五百一十条、麻皮八千多斤、木桩一万八千根及大批木料。石料十七·八方被抛入河内。老二坝上的大捞桩七十条（每条重三十斤）亦被割抛入河内。致新、老二坝均掉垫。（坝或埽发生下坠现象为掉垫。掉垫后，坝埽可能被冲走，黄水就会直扑河堤，发生决口。）四月上半月，蒋军整六十八师及伪鄄城大队先后袭击我抢修员工四次，使我被迫停工。五月以来，蒋军整五十五师逐日以小部队至坝上骚扰，又在老二坝上筑碉，拆去木桩甚多。五月十二日又抢去我积存于军屯（鄄城以北）的秸料廿一万斤。高村险工于二月下旬亦被蒋特连续破坏两次，第七坝重要铁绳被割断二十根。经我修复后，四月十六日蒋军六十八师一部又侵至该地，将铁绳割断十根，抛入河内。四月十九日蒋军便衣武装九人，又将第四坝柳桩破坏投入河内，第四、五、六、七各坝所有铁绳、麻绳全部割断。第七坝当即掉垫，坝上漫水三公寸。我修防处正拟修复，东明敌即窜踞高村，使我无法兴工；致第七坝的埽被冲走十五公尺。四月底下游又发现该坝丈多长的柳把子被水冲下。四月廿一日该村所存秸料六万斤被抢走。五月十二日蒋军五十五师又将该险工坝上的秸料抢走四万斤。同时，四月二十日高村上游老君堂我运料船一只亦遭蒋军焚毁。朱口、刘庄两险工于四月上半月被敌破坏，坝埽上的铁绳、麻绳被全部割断抛入河内。四月二十一日刘庄所存柳把四千斤又遭焚毁。上述四大险工均遭严重破坏，蒋机则不断沿河轰炸、扫射，阻我抢险工程。入春以来我堤上员工在轰炸、扫射下，据不完全统计死伤达五十六人。南岸险工被破坏，处于无法修复状态，不断发生掉垫出险。\n    【冀鲁豫电】东阿、河西武工队二、九小队掩护抢险运石船只，击退五倍于我之敌的多路进犯。二十一日上午八时，我运石大队由某地到河南望口山（平阴属）运石，武工队占据刘山头一带警戒。东阿、柳河圈等地之敌保安五旅二百五十余人，机枪六挺，突分四路向我进攻，东阿武装部张干事、靖队长率队奋勇抵抗，坚决阻击五倍于我之敌。敌机两架亦于此时窜入运石渡口上空，疯狂扫射，我辛、顾二股长冒敌弹雨，与水手努力将船驶回北岸。四十分钟后，武工队以运输船已回岸，遂分路撤退。敌机仍继续轰炸，一天袭扰达九次之多，幸我运石船只已分散隐蔽，未受损失。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th: The Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on \"July 1st\" regarding the study of on-the-job cadres, instructing Party committees at all levels to conscientiously organize on-the-job cadres to study and master Mao Zedong Thought, study the Party Central Committee's lines and policies, summarize work experience, and improve cadres' awareness and work quality. The aim is to resolutely eliminate blindness in work and certain serious undisciplined and anarchic malpractices, in order to adapt to the victorious development of the Liberation War nationwide. The instructions pointed out: \"In the actual work of war, land reform, and production for disaster relief, it has been revealed that a considerable number of our cadres, and even some leading cadres, have a very low theoretical level, a poor grasp of policy, lack a sense of new things, and lack analysis and research on actual movements, simply and isolatedly implementing policies, with serious blindness, thus causing considerable losses in work.\" The instructions criticized the phenomenon of leading cadres neglecting the leadership of study, saying: \"Even now, many leading comrades do not pay enough attention to leading and organizing the study of on-the-job cadres, fail to regularly pay attention to leading cadres' research on policies, summarizing work, and solving the ideological and work problems of their subordinate cadres, but rather emphasize what is less important and neglect what is more important, placing the most important leadership of study, namely ideological leadership, in a secondary and incidental position, pushing it to the支部 [zhī bù - branch] or general cadres, and becoming mired in the quagmire of事務主義 [shì wù zhǔ yì - bureaucraticism] from which they cannot extricate themselves.\" Therefore, the instructions require that \"every leading comrade should regard leading and organizing cadres' study as their important responsibility, putting it in the first place of leadership work. Only in this way can they continuously improve cadres' awareness, solve the difficulties in leadership work, improve work quality, overcome the shortcomings of bureaucraticism, and make their work departments like a good clock, coordinated and accurate.\" Regarding the method of study, the instructions said: \"Combining theory with practice is the only correct study policy. The erroneous phenomenon of neglecting theoretical study, not paying attention to reading Chairman Mao's works, not reading the Party's directives and documents, and not reading newspapers must be changed. All designated study documents must be read in detail to understand their spirit and essence. At the same time, the weapon of criticism and self-criticism must be used to examine ideology, work, and work style, and to prevent the tendency to deviate from reality.\" The instructions stipulate: According to the existing on-the-job cadres' cultural level, comprehension ability, and needs, study is divided into three categories: A. Cadres with general cultural level and work experience should focus on studying policies, with the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification work in 1948, the two documents analyzing classes in 1933, and Comrade Ren Bishi's report on several issues in land reform as the center, in connection with the relevant documents of the Northwest Bureau. The study will be conducted by the leading cadres of each department. B.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, July 9th: Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar of the Central Plains Military Region, and Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar, have repeatedly called on the troops to conscientiously implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention to strengthen the mass perspective of the troops. Political Commissar Deng recently emphasized at a meeting of cadres of a certain column: This is a matter of implementing the Party's line and policies. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention are what everyone in the entire army can and must do in order to implement the Party's line and policies. These were stipulated by Chairman Mao at the very beginning of the establishment of the People's Liberation Army; they are the basic conditions for being a revolutionary soldier. Chairman Mao concentrated the three major tasks of the people's army into the Three Main Rules of Discipline. He concentrated fighting into obeying all commands. He concentrated on doing mass work into not taking a single needle or thread from the masses. He concentrated fundraising into turning in all spoils. The Eight Points for Attention are the concretization of our policies and tasks. For example, speaking politely and not beating or scolding people is to oppose warlordism. Fair trade is to protect the policy of industry and commerce. Not mistreating prisoners and not searching prisoners' pockets are the prisoner policy. Therefore, we must not think that this is just a simple regulation from the superiors. Political Commissar Deng then called on the company soldiers' committees to have someone specifically responsible for supervising and inspecting the implementation of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. He said, \"If this is done well, our army's strength will be infinite.\" He gave an example: \"There was an area in Dabie Mountain ruled by local tyrants, which had long opposed us for 20 years. This time, when we first went there, all the people ran away. But our discipline was very good, and we didn't touch any of the people's things, and we cleaned up the station very well. The second time we went, the people didn't run away. They said, 'If we had known you were so good, why would we have run away?'\"\n\nAt the political work conference of the Central Plains Field Army, Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun emphatically criticized the phenomenon of some troops violating the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. He pointed out that the main reasons are: leaders at all levels have not provided sufficient and serious education and inspection, and have not mobilized the vast numbers of cadres and soldiers to jointly supervise; a few responsible cadres have even adopted a laissez-faire attitude of indifference and abandonment of leadership. He said, \"If we want to resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's policy of winning over the masses in the new areas, we must strictly implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Otherwise, all so-called mass work is empty talk.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, July 9th: In a certain unit of the Central Plains Field Army, the mass perspective has been generally improved during the troop consolidation, and they have consciously abided by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. According to the statistics of the Second Battalion of a certain unit in May, they helped the people carry more than 17,000 loads of water, plowed, hoed, and watered a total of 184 mu of land, and did many other odd jobs. The First Company of the unit held 21 mass meetings in one month to publicize the People's Liberation Army's propositions and policies. The soldiers' committee of another company saw that the company did not pay much attention to discipline towards the masses. After discussion and research, it immediately called on everyone to carry forward the glorious tradition and hard-working style of the People's Army and do a good job in the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. During marches, they tried their best to mobilize fewer livestock and vehicles to reduce the burden on the masses; whenever they arrived at a place, they immediately carried out the movement to fill the water tanks and fill the landlords' water tanks. The soldiers' committee conducted daily inspections and summaries, and recorded and commended the good squads and individuals. As a result, the company's mass discipline was continuously improved.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中原邓张正副政委号召　加强部队群众观念  某部普遍自觉遵守三大纪律八项注意\n\n1948-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中原邓张正副政委号召\n    加强部队群众观念\n    某部普遍自觉遵守三大纪律八项注意\n    【新华社中原前线九日电】中原军区政委邓小平、副政委张际春最近一再号召部队，好好实行三大纪律、八项注意，加强部队群众观念。邓政委近在某纵队干部会上，强调指出：这是贯彻党的路线和政策的问题。党的路线和政策，在全军中人人能办到和必需办到的就是三大纪律、八项注意。这是毛主席开始建立人民解放军就规定下来的；是做一个革命军人的起码条件。毛主席把人民军队的三大任务集中为三大纪律。把打仗，集中为一切行动听指挥。把做群众工作，集中为不拿群众一针一线。把筹款，集中为一切缴获交公。八项注意，则是我们的政策和任务的具体化。如说话和气，不打人骂人，是反对军阀主义。买卖公平，是保护工商业政策。不虐待俘虏，不搜俘虏腰包，是俘虏政策。因此，不能以为这是上级的简单规定。接着邓政委号召连队士兵委员会要有专人来负责督促和检查三大纪律和八项注意的执行，他说：“这件事办好了，我们军队的力量就是无穷的。”他举了一个例子说：“大别山有个土顽统治的地区，廿年来长期反对我们，这回我们第一次去，老百姓都跑光了。但是我们的纪律很好，老百姓的东西一点也没动，又把驻地打扫得干干净净。第二次我们去，老百姓就不跑了。他们说：‘早知道你们这样好，我们还跑什么？’”\n    张副政委在中原野战军政工会议上，着重批评了某些部队违犯三大纪律、八项注意的现象。他指出主要原因是：各级领导上没有足够认真的教育和检查，没有发动广大干部和战士起来共同监督；少数负责干部，甚至采取漠不关心的放弃领导的自由主义态度。他说：“我们要坚决执行党中央争取新区群众的政策，就要严格执行三大纪律、八项注意。不然一切所谓群众工作都是空话。”\n    【新华社中原前线九日电】中原野战军某部，在整军中，群众观念普遍提高，做到自觉遵守三大纪律八项注意。某部二大队五月份的统计，即帮助人民担水一万七千多担，犁地、锄地、浇地共一百八十四亩及其他许多零活。该部一中队一个月内召开了二十一次群众会，宣传解放军的主张和政策。另部某连士兵委员会看到该连对群众纪律不大注意，经讨论研究后立即号召大家发扬人民军队的光荣传统和艰苦作风，做好三大纪律八项注意。在行军中尽量作到少动员牲口和车辆，减轻群众负担；每到一地即进行满缸运动、替房东担满水缸。士兵委员会每天进行检查总结，对好的班排和个人记功表扬。该连的群众纪律因而不断改进。"

One of them, named Luo Chengxiang, couldn't endure the hardships when he first arrived and didn't want to work hard. Su would often explain and educate him, clarifying the noble essence and glorious tradition of our army, and clearly pointing out that the Kuomintang had reached its end. At the same time, he showed concern for his life in many ways. Luo said with emotion, \"If I don't work hard now, I'll really be letting down Lao Su.\" Comrade Su Zhenxuan also used this method to transform Liu Peixing, who had attempted to escape, into an activist. After his class leader, Du Furong, fell ill after fighting in Tianzhen, he also had to march. In order to take care of him, Su ran back and forth along the road and stayed up all night, finding doctors and stretchers. Once, he even carried the class leader for two or three li on his back.

Recently, there has been no thorough rain in various areas, and the crops in most dryland areas are showing signs of withering, especially in thin slopes and sandy land, where the drought is becoming serious. Some areas have also suffered from insect, wind, and hail disasters. Apart from the wheat-harvesting areas, the food shortage is still very serious. In order to overcome the current natural disasters, the Prefectural Committee specifically instructs: (1) Intensify seedling thinning. The agricultural proverb says, \"A hoe can bring three points of rain.\" More hoeing can withstand drought. All areas should vigorously organize the masses to quickly finish the first and second rounds of hoeing. The food shortage problem of disaster-stricken households should be solved by mobilizing the masses to help each other, and the government should also quickly issue loans to solve production difficulties. (2) Utilize all possible water conservancy facilities, quickly repair all possible large and small canals, and build water ponds, ensuring that every possible acre is irrigated and every possible plant is watered. (3) Prepare seeds for late-planting crops (buckwheat, sixty-day corn, millet, rapeseed, etc.) to be replanted and rushed after rainfall. (4) Actively develop sideline occupations to increase people's income. Seize the gaps in hoeing to organize women and children to dig medicinal herbs, engage in textile and other sideline production. The leadership should solve the supply of raw materials and the sales of finished products. (5) Practice strict economy, starting with government agencies, organizations, and troops. Call on all staff and commanders and fighters to promote the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the masses, save food to relieve disasters; at the same time, widely publicize among the masses and carry out mass-based economy campaigns. (6) Once there is thorough rain, immediately organize all forces to rush to hoe seedlings and replant. (7) Eliminate insect pests: Drought is prone to insect pests. Currently, insect pests have been found in fruit trees in Laiyuan and Zhuozhou, and in valleys in Wanping. All counties, districts, and villages should conduct thorough inspections and eliminate them immediately upon discovery. (8) After a severe drought, there is bound to be a severe flood. All agricultural gaps must be used to build embankments, repair dams, and dredge ditches to prevent rain from damaging fields and autumn seedlings.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳三地委指示  加紧锄苗准备晚种厉行节约消灭害虫\n\n1948-07-11\n第1版()\n专栏：紧急动员抗旱备荒！\n\n　　北岳三地委指示\n    加紧锄苗准备晚种厉行节约消灭害虫\n    【察哈尔讯】北岳中共三地委于六月二十五日发出关于抗旱渡荒的紧急指示。近日各地未落透雨，大部地区的旱地庄稼多呈枯萎状态，薄坡地及沙土地尤为严重，旱象已将形成。部分地区又遭虫、风、雹灾，除麦收地区外，粮荒现象仍很严重。为克服当前天灾，地委特指示：（一）加紧锄苗。农谚云：“锄头能带三分雨”，多锄可以耐旱，各地应以大力组织群众，赶快锄完头遍锄二遍。灾户的缺粮问题，应发动群众互助互济，政府也应迅速发放贷粮解决生产困难。（二）利用一切可能利用的水利，迅速修竣一切可能利用的大小水渠，挡修水汪，做到能浇一亩算一亩，能浇一棵算一棵。（三）准备晚种作物种子（荞麦，六十还仓玉米，黍子，菜籽等），准备落雨后补种、抢种之用。（四）积极发展副业，增加人民收入，抓紧锄地空隙，组织妇女儿童刨药村、纺织等副业生产，领导上应解决原料供给及成品的销路问题。（五）厉行节约，首先由机关、团体、部队做起，号召全体工作人员和指战员发扬与群众共患难的精神，节省粮食救灾；同时要在群众中广泛宣传，开展群众性的节约运动。（六）一旦落了透雨，应立即组织全力突击锄苗，补种。（七）消灭虫灾：天旱容易发生虫灾，目前涞涿果木树、宛平谷地已发现虫害，各县区村应切实检查，发现了立即扑灭。（八）大旱之后必有大涝，须利用一切农隙，垒埝，修坝、疏通渠沟，以防天雨冲坏田地秋苗。"

    "content": "Political Work of Beiyue Laborers on the Expedition to Chahar, Suiyuan, and Northern Shanxi\n　　　　Jie Bing, Yu Fu\n　　[Beiyue News] During the Chahar South, Suiyuan East, and Northern Shanxi campaigns this spring, cadres from various counties in the Beiyue District leading the laborers, carried out propaganda, mobilization, and education work at all times. Coupled with the exemplary role of Communist Party members, they successfully consolidated the troops and completed the enormous task of supporting the front.\n　　　　Mobilization Work Before Departure\n　　After the laborers from various counties were assembled, the county and district cadres conducted political mobilization, explaining the current situation and tasks, departure time, and matters requiring attention. They also guaranteed that the villages would ensure production and cultivation on behalf of the laborers, and fairly and reasonably distribute land and the fruits of victory. This dispelled the laborers' concerns ideologically and consolidated the troops. After the Baobei Campaign, Tang County laborers established a echelon organization, equipped with personnel for rotation expeditions. Every stretcher team had a Communist Party member as a backbone. The establishment of branch organizations ensured the consolidation of the support-the-front teams. Before departure, the masses of Tang County and the departing laborers held a joint celebration, where the support-the-front laborers proposed: 1. No desertion, no returning home without completing the task; 2. Guarantee mutual assistance and friendship, and unity of purpose after departure; 3. No violation of mass discipline; 4. Deserters are willing to be punished by the masses and compensate for cultivation work. Subsequently, the masses also proposed: Guarantee to cultivate the land well for the support-the-front laborers, deliver manure, and solve all family difficulties, dispelling the laborers' ideological concerns and enhancing their confidence in completing the task. However, the leadership of Pingshan lacked ideological preparation for the support-the-front work, lacked pre-organization education for the laborers, and lacked in-depth political mobilization when the task arrived. They were temporarily assembled, neither sending strong cadres to lead nor establishing sound branch organizations, resulting in desertions among the laborers.\n　　　　Political Work During the March\n　　This time, the laborers' expedition covered more than two thousand li. It went through the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. They crossed grasslands, rivers, climbed high mountains, coupled with enemy aircraft harassment, the laborers were very arduous. However, the vast majority of laborers' marching order was always in order, emotions often full, the reason is that there is a strong political work and party members' backbone guarantee. When the main force advanced to Tianzhen, they climbed a very high mountain, the cold wind made breathing difficult. Zhang Chun, a Pingshan stretcher team member, was frozen because of his thin clothes. The fifth company commander and deputy company commander immediately took action, carrying him on a stretcher; and mobilized everyone to say: \"Grit your teeth, through the coldest place, the bottom of the hill is the campsite.\" The brigade cadres also encouraged: \"Walking on the snow mountain is really hard. Talking about hardship after suffering is also a person\" (person means happy). When crossing the Sanggan River, the river was not long after the thaw, the water was turbulent. Thirty-five laborers from Lingshou and Lingqiu counties fell into the water due to the damage of the pontoon bridge. The leadership immediately mobilized to rescue them, proposing: \"Crossing the Sanggan River is like fighting a battle, saving a person is a merit.\" Comrades such as Kang Sheng, Kang Er'ao, Liu Bu Lai, Zhao Tangji, Zhao Zhengfa... and others bravely rescued the drowning people. On the night of March 28, the Pingshan militia marched from Machishi to Shuang Gucheng, it began to rain as soon as they set off, the wind was cold and the sky was dark, the gullies were deep and the road was slippery, and some team members were in low spirits. At this time, the leadership proposed: \"Today's heavy rain, enjoy peace in the future.\" After arriving at the village, they told everyone stories of heroes suffering, stabilizing everyone's emotions. Some laborers did not want to march at night, complaining: \"Why not walk during the day.\" At that time, they explained: \"Airplanes bomb during the day, the target is small at night, and it is easy to keep military secrets.\" After the laborers understood, the complaints decreased. During the march, the slogan of promoting mutual assistance and friendship was put forward, many cadres carried luggage for the laborers (such as the Huolu Labor Brigade Captain, Political Commissar, etc.), and the laborers also took things for each other, improving the laborers' emotions. During enemy air raids, An Xiyun, the squad leader of Huolu, who made great contributions, immediately shouted to his class: \"Disperse and lie down on the spot, running around is a big loss, running away and losing contact is even more dangerous, we came out together, go back together.\" In this way, they were not bombed several times.\n　　　　Political Work in Camps\n　　Before the camp, it is necessary to explain the situation of the house every time, explain that when the distribution is not good, do not go in casually, explain that respect the local customs, resolutely implement the three major disciplines and eight points for attention. Make the laborers ideologically prepared. Once, due to housing difficulties, 60 Pingshan laborers lived in three rooms. Everyone not only had no complaints, but also proposed three major guarantees for the camp: 1. Don't let the landlord say no after leaving; 2. Guarantee that the landlord's things will not be lost; 3. Guarantee that the landlord has water to drink. Huolu laborers cleaned the yards and streets wherever they went, and fetched water for the landlords. Many laborers also publicized the policies of the liberated areas to the masses, the land reform of farmers turning over, and the democratic life of the people. When leaving, they proposed \"Three Clean\" (house clean, yard clean, street clean), \"Three Full\" (water tank full, landlord satisfied, village cadres satisfied), \"Three Checks\" (check whether the team members have taken things, check whether the landlord has lost things, check whether the quartermaster has settled accounts with the village). When the third company of Jingxing was camping in Shizhangfang, west of Ying County City, a landlord poured water on the kang, unwilling to let the laborers live, after the laborers lived in, they helped him produce and fetch water, and talked to them about the life of the people in the liberated areas, the relationship gradually improved. When leaving, the landlord sent them out and said: \"Come to my house again in the future; you are really good!\" Sure enough, the second time they went, the landlord pulled them in. In combat situations, it is often necessary to camp in the open, at this time, it is necessary to make timely mobilization work. When the first and second troops of Lingqiu laborers were camping in Lige Pagoda area of Fengzhen, the weather was very cold, and the emotions of the team members fluctuated slightly. The leadership immediately explained: \"Distributed housing may be lost, collective camping suffers a little, but it will not be lost, you see, the troop leaders are not camping like us?\" After the explanation, the team members' emotions stabilized. When the Lingqiu laborers were camping in Tuanbao, there were many people and few houses, many cadres and party members were willing to camp outside, letting the laborers live in the house, which moved many laborers. When the Tang County laborers were camping in Dongwafang, they proposed the slogan of \"mutual assistance and friendship\", some in the house gave their leather jackets to the laborers camping outside, and the second row automatically let the first row live in the house, and they lived in the yard.\n　　　　Rescuing the Wounded Under Fire\n　　After our army engaged the enemy, many laborers often rushed to the front line to rescue the wounded. The Tang County Labor Corps convened a meeting of activists before the war, organized the backbone to take the lead. At the beginning of the battle, it loudly proposed: \"The army is fighting in front, we are following behind, the wounded must be rescued.\" The Lingshou laborers were surrounded by the enemy on three sides in Ying County. The squad leader Xin Quanlai carried a wounded soldier and never let go, and told the wounded soldier: \"If I am here, you are here.\" When the enemy approached, he took the wounded soldier's gun and retreated while fighting, finally escaping. Their heroic and courageous spirit won the commendation and praise of the troop leaders.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳民工远征察绥晋北的政治工作\n捷兵　玉夫\n1948-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳民工远征察绥晋北的政治工作\n    捷兵　玉夫\n    【北岳讯】今春察南绥东晋北战役队，北岳区各县领导民工的干部，随时展开宣传鼓动教育工作，再加上共产党员的模范作用，胜利的巩固了部队，完成了支前的巨大任务。\n    　　　　出发前的动员工作\n    各县民工集中后，县区干部都进行了政治动员，说明目前形势和任务，出征时间及应注意的事项。并提出村里保证生产代耕，公平合理的分配土地和胜利果实。从思想上解除了民工的顾虑，巩固了部队。唐县民工在保北战役后，就建立了梯队组织配备人员，轮流出征。每付担架都有党员作骨干。建立了支部组织，保证了支前队伍的巩固。出发前，唐县群众和出征民工召开联欢大会，支前民工提出：一、不开小差，不完成任务不回家；二、出发后，保证互助友爱，团结一心；三、不违犯群众纪律；四、开小差愿受群众处分，并补还代耕工。接着群众也提出：保证给支前民工种好地，送上粪，并解决家庭的一切困难，解除了民工的思想顾虑，提高了民工完成任务的信心。但平山领导上对支前工作思想准备不够，对民工事前没有组织教育，任务到来又缺乏深入的政治动员，临时调凑，既未派出坚强干部领导，又未建立健全的支部组织，于是出现了民工逃亡的现象。\n    　　　　行军中的政治工作\n    此次民工远征，行程两千多里。历经冀、晋、察、绥四省。过草原，渡大河，爬高山，再加上敌机的骚扰，民工是很艰苦的。但绝大多数民工的行军秩序始终不乱，情绪经常饱满，原因就是有坚强的政治工作和党员的骨干保证。主力进军天镇的时候，爬过一个很高的山，冷风吹得呼吸都很困难。平山担架队张春因衣服单薄冻坏了，五连正副连长，立即亲自动手，用担架抬着走；并动员大家说：“咬紧牙关，通过最冷的地方，下岭就是宿营地。”大队干部也鼓动说：“走雪山，真是苦。苦后谈苦也是人”（人是愉快的意思）。渡桑乾河时，解冻不久，水势凶猛，灵寿，灵邱两县民工三十五名因浮桥损坏，失足落水。领导上立即动员下水抢救，提出：“过桑乾河好比打一仗，救下人的记一功”。康生、康二熬、刘簿来、赵堂吉、赵正发……等同志奋不顾身，将落水者救起。三月二十八日黑夜，平山民兵从马池石向双古城进军，一出发就下起大雨来，风寒天黑，沟深路滑，有些队员情绪很低。这时领导上提出：“今天大雨淋，今后享太平”。到村之后，又给大家讲英雄受苦的故事，安定了大家的情绪。有些民工不愿夜行军，埋怨：“为什么白天不走”。当时又给解释：“白天飞机炸，黑夜目标小，又容易保守军事秘密”。民工们闹清后，怨言减少了。行军中提出发扬互助友爱的口号，不少干部替民工背行李（如获鹿民工大队长、政委等），民工也互相拿东西，提高了民工的情绪。在敌机袭扰的时候，获鹿立了大功的班长安喜云，立即向他班的人喊出：“就地分散卧倒，乱跑要吃大亏，跑散失掉连系更危险，咱们一块出来，一块回。”这样几次都没被炸着。\n    　　　　宿营中的政治工作\n    宿营前，每次都要说明房子的情况，说明没有分配好的时候，不要随便进去，说明要尊重当地的民情风俗，坚决执行三大纪律八项注意。使民工思想上有所准备。一次因房子困难，平山民工六十人住了三间，大家不但毫无怨言，并提出宿营的三大保证：一、走后不让房东说不是；二、保证房东东西不受损失；三、保证房东有水吃。获鹿民工每到一处，即打扫院子和街道，给房东挑水。不少的民工并向群众宣传解放区的政策，土地改革农民翻身及老百姓的民主生活等。临走时提出“三净”（屋净、院净、街道净），“三满”（水缸挑满、房东满意、村干部满意），“三查”（查队员是否拿了东西、查房东是否丢了东西、查司务长是否和村里算清帐）。井陉三连在应县城西师长坊宿营时，一家房东在炕上泼了水，不愿叫民工住，民工们住下后，帮他生产挑水，和他们谈解放区人民的生活，关系逐渐搞好了。走时房东送出门来说：“以后来了还到咱家住；你们真好！”果然第二次一去，房东便把他们拉进去了。在战斗情况下常常需要露营，这时又须要及时作动员工作。灵邱民工一二部队在丰镇里圪塔一带露营时，天气很冷，队员情绪稍有波动。领导上立即解释：“分散有房住，可能受损失，集体露营受点罪，但是不会受损失，你们看，部队首长不是和咱一样露营吗？”解释后队员情绪安定了。灵邱民工在团堡宿营时，人多房少，不少干部、党员情愿在外面露营，让民工们住在家里，感动了好多民工。唐县民工在东瓦房宿营时，提出了“互助友爱”的口号，有些在房子里的，便将皮袄给外面露营的民工穿，二排自动让一排住在房里，自己住在院里。\n    　　　　炮火下抢救伤员\n    当我军和敌人接火后，不少民工往往冲到最前线抢救伤员。唐县的民工团在战前就召开了积极分子会，组织骨干起带头作用。在战斗一开始又响亮的提出：“军队前面打，咱们后面跟，伤员一定要抢下来”。灵寿民工在应县曾被敌人三面包围，班长辛全来背着一个伤员始终不放，并告伤员说：“有我就有你。”当敌人迫近时，他拿了伤员的枪边打边退，终于脱险了。他们这种英勇果敢的精神，获得了部队首长的嘉奖和表扬。"

    "content": "Emergency Mobilization to Combat Drought and Prepare for Famine!\n\n　　Governments at All Levels Actively Organize Leadership\n    Ji Zhong Peasants Dig Canals and Wells\n    [Ji Zhong News] Peasants in various parts of Ji Zhong are actively engaged in water conservancy construction. In terms of canal construction: Jin藁 County originally planned to complete fourteen branch canals throughout the year, and one-half has been completed this spring, with a total length of 62 *hua li*. Two-fifths of the small branch canals have also been completed. The main canal project has basically been completed. The county also dug a diversion river more than 420 meters long to divert water from the Hutuo River for irrigation. The wheat fields in the villages along the canals, about 4,700 *mu*, have all been irrigated once. The peasants in the villages through which the twenty-two branch canals flow have voluntarily provided more than 20,000 bricks and built forty-nine small sluice gates, expanding the original irrigated area by two-thirds, capable of irrigating 8,000 *mu*. Anxin County has now completed more than 120 *li* of new canals. According to statistics from sixty-nine villages, a total of 100,700 *mu* of land have been irrigated; and six sluice gates have been built. The government has provided 70,000 *jin* of grain to support the peasants in the county to dig canals. The Ji Zhong Public Works Bureau has begun to open a 70-*li* irrigation canal in Ningjin, Ji Zhong, and Ningnan, Ji Nan (the wheat-producing area around ＠kou and Chengbei), diverting water from the Fuyang River and the Xinsha River, which can irrigate more than 58,000 *mu* of land. In terms of well digging: The Ji Zhong Administrative Office organized well-digging work teams to go to the countryside and established water conservancy promotion societies in Anguo, Hejian, and Xinji to fully lead the peasants in digging wells. In coordination with the promotion societies in various counties, well-digging equipment is purchased uniformly and sold to well-digging households for use. Local democratic governments also issue a large number of loans to support them. As of June 10, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-nine counties and cities, 2,659 new wells have been dug and 1,675 broken wells have been repaired. Shulu organized a water conservancy work team, which is leading the masses to launch the \"Thousand Wells Movement.\" Raoyang County plans to complete 500 new wells throughout the year. In some counties where there is no habit of digging wells, the government has organized well-digging work groups to find key areas and villages, and gradually promote it universally. For example, Renqiu has never had the habit of digging wells and suffers from drought every year. Although the government has repeatedly called for digging wells in the past, it has often resulted in perfunctory responses because the leadership did not pay close attention and the masses did not sufficiently understand the benefits of digging wells. This year, the government decided to focus on the third district as the key area and Shicun as the key village, to provide specific assistance, gain experience, and promote it throughout the county. After the well-digging team arrived in Shicun, after propaganda visits, they found that the masses had many concerns about digging wells. Some felt that they did not have money or materials and could not afford to dig, and that government loans could not solve all the problems. Some suspected that if they borrowed public funds, their land would be confiscated if they could not repay them in the future. Some believed that digging wells in this area would not work and that irrigating would make the land \"roll\" (meaning bad). Some were afraid that digging wells would damage the crops when walking back and forth in the fields. Some were afraid that digging wells would lead to more taxes. Therefore, no one came forward to lead and organize. The well-digging team grasped these situations and used methods such as large and small meetings and individual talks to publicize the benefits of digging wells, the loan regulations, the intentions of the well-digging team, and the collection methods, etc., gradually dispelling the masses' ideological concerns. Then, a group of backbone activists were discovered, who influenced others, forming a well-digging craze in the village. Currently, nine new and repaired wells have been completed, and four waterwheels have been purchased. Under the influence of the village, nearby villages have also begun to dig wells. As of now, thirty-eight new and repaired old wells have been completed in the third district. As the well-digging work achieved results, peasants in various places purchased a large number of waterwheels. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-nine counties and cities, 2,131 new waterwheels have been added and 3,090 old waterwheels have been repaired. Xinle County alone purchased and repaired more than 990 vehicles. Xiangqu Village in the fourth district of the county converted the undistributed floating wealth into funds and combined it with some private capital to buy forty-one waterwheels. Currently, peasants in various places are seizing the favorable season for digging wells after the wheat harvest and continuing to carry out the well-digging movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各级政府积极组织领导　冀中农民开渠打井\n\n1948-07-11\n第1版()\n专栏：紧急动员抗旱备荒！\n\n　　各级政府积极组织领导\n    冀中农民开渠打井\n    【冀中讯】冀中各地农民积极进行水利建设。在开渠方面：晋藁县原计划全年完成十四道支渠，今春已完成二分之一，全长六十二华里。小支渠也完成了五分之二。干渠工程基本上已经完成。该县并挖掘长四百二十多米的引河一道，引滹沱河水浇地。渠道所属村庄的麦田约四千七百余亩，都普遍浇过一遍。二十二个支渠流经的村庄，农民自动出砖二万多块，建立了四十九个小闸，扩大原有浇地面积三分之二，能浇地八千亩。安新县现已完成新渠一百二十余里，据六十九个村庄统计，共浇地十万零七百余亩；并修成水闸六个。政府曾贷粮七万斤，扶植该县农民开渠。冀中工务局已着手在冀中宁晋及冀南宁南地区（＠口、城北一带之产麦区），开一道七十余里的灌溉渠，引滏阳河、新沙河水，可灌溉五万八千余亩土地。在打井方面：冀中行居组织了打井工作队下乡，并在安国、河间、辛集成立了水利推进社，全力领导农民打井。配合各县推进社统一购买打井器材，卖给各打井户使用。各地民主政府也大量发放贷款扶植。截至六月十日，据二十九个县、市不完全统计，已打新井二千六百五十九眼，修理坏井一千六百七十五眼。束鹿组织了水利工作队，正领导群众开展千眼井运动。饶阳全县计划全年完成五百眼新井。在若干没有打井习惯的县份，政府组织了打井工作组，找出重点区村，逐渐普遍推广。如任邱向来没有打井习惯，每年都闹荒旱，过去政府虽不断号召打井，但由于领导上抓的不紧，群众对打井的好处又认识不足，往往形成应付。今年政府决定以三区为重点区，以史村为重点村，具体帮助，取得经验，推广全县。打井组到了史村，经过宣传访问，发现群众对打井顾虑很多，有的觉得没钱没材料，打不起，政府贷款不一定能全部解决问题。有的怀疑贷了公家款，将来给不了就没收地。有的认为这个地区打井不行，浇来浇去会把地浇滚了（坏的意思）。有的怕打了井，来往在地里走，糟蹋了庄稼。有的怕打了井征收多。因此没有人出头领导与组织。打井组掌握了这些情况，便以大小会议和个别谈话等方式宣传打井的好处，贷款的条例，打井组的来意和征收办法等等，逐步打通了群众的思想顾虑。接着发现了一批骨干积极分子，由他们影响别人，在该村形成打井热潮，现已新开和修理了九眼井，买了四辆水车。在该村影响下，附近各村也开始打井，截至目前，三区已打成新井与修好旧井三十八眼。打井工作获得成绩，各地农民即大量购买水车，据二十九个县、市不完全统计，已添新水车二千一百三十一辆，修理旧水车三千零九十辆。只新乐一县，就购买和修理了九百九十多辆。该县四区庠曲村，将未分的浮财变款，结合一部私资，买了四十一辆水车。现各地农民正抓紧麦收后打井的有利季节，继续开展打井运动。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 9th.\n\n    International Week\n    Eastern Europe: In the Soviet Union, major industrial centers reported successes in late June, having completed the first six months of the third year of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Moscow, Leningrad (except for one district), Kharkov, Kiev, Tallinn, Riga, Voronezh, the Donets Basin, the Urals, and other famous industrial centers have all completed or exceeded their production plans for the first half of the year. Completing the third year's production plan by the anniversary of the October Revolution has now become the goal to be realized by Soviet workers. A new rural electrification plan has begun to be implemented, expected to be completed within three years, at which time all state farms (excluding collective farms) in the Soviet Union will be fully electrified.\n    In Czechoslovakia, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party officially merged on June 27 to form the Czechoslovak Unified Communist Party. After the merger, the party holds 237 seats in the 300-seat parliament.\n    Western Europe: The half-day general strike called by the Italian General Confederation of Labor began across Italy on July 2. The purpose of this strike is to achieve universal wage increases and to oppose the Gasperi government's policy of dismissing workers and closing factories. This is a general strike held in stages. The July 2 strike was centered on transport workers, with \"an estimated three million\" workers from various industries participating (Associated Press). Subsequently, there will be national strikes of chemical, electricity, steel, and gas workers over the four days from July 6 to 9. The strike of London dockworkers in Britain ended automatically on June 30 after persisting for sixteen days. This strike in Britain shows that British workers are \"leaving\" the reactionary unions that \"defend the interests of the bourgeoisie rather than the interests of the working class\" (Pravda). The Soviet military commander of Greater Berlin sent a letter to the three Allied commanders of the United States, Britain, and France on the 2nd, condemning them for being responsible for disrupting the work of the Berlin Allied Command and declaring that the Soviet Chief of Staff of the Allied Staff would no longer be able to attend Allied Staff meetings.\n    The sixteen Western European countries participating in the \"Marshall Plan\" have successively signed so-called \"bilateral agreements\" with the United States, putting on the \"dollar shackles.\" As of July 3, the United States had signed agreements with fourteen countries, including France, Italy, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Luxembourg, and the Chiang Kai-shek government. In the negotiation process of these agreements, the United States initially issued draft agreements to various countries in \"a domineering tone,\" and then threatened them with \"suspension of aid,\" forcing the recipient countries to quickly accept the conditions that enslave them. The rulers of Britain, France, and other countries, although they had expressed dissatisfaction with these harsh conditions, finally succumbed shamefully under the pressure of the United States. However, people in these countries have issued strong calls for resistance to this \"shameful treaty of servitude.\" French Communist leader Duclos announced that the French Communist Party \"will fight against the Marshall Plan and everything related to it.\" Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti has also announced that the 2.5 million members of the Italian Communist Party will do everything in their power to oppose the \"Marshall Plan.\"\n    Americas: A new anti-imperialist party, the People's Party, was recently established in the Central American country of Mexico. Despite various obstructions by the reactionary authorities, the party now has 360,000 members. The first chairman of the People's Party, the famous Mexican labor movement leader Toledano, declared at the party's founding congress that the new party would fight for a free, sovereign, and independent Mexico. The new party's manifesto opposes American expansion, which endangers the independence of Latin American countries.\n    Far East: The Japanese Communist Party and progressive forces have achieved new victories in the elections of trade union leadership organizations. In the provisional national congress of the All-Japan National Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union (with 400,000 members), the Japanese Communist Party members and leftists accounted for 56 percent of the 44 newly elected central committee members, while the right-wingers accounted for only 11 percent. Ikkichi Tokura, leader of the Left-Wing Youth People's League, was re-elected as the chairman of the union. Two of the three vice-chairmen are members of the Japanese Communist Party.\n    Vietnamese Democratic Republic Minister of National Defense Vo Nguyen Giap issued a statement saying: Viet Minh's arms production is increasing day by day, enough to continuously supply the armed forces, and capable of manufacturing various types of modern weapons.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国际一周\n\n1948-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：国际一周\n\n　　国际一周\n    东欧方面：在苏联，各大工业中心在六月下旬纷纷传出先期完成五年计划第三年头六个月工业生产计划的捷音。莫斯科、列宁格勒（一个区除外）、哈尔科夫、基辅、塔林、里加、沃罗涅兹、顿尼兹盆地、乌拉尔等著名工业中心，都完成或超过了前半年的生产计划。在十月革命纪念节日完成第三年生产计划，现已成为苏联工人将要实现的目标。新的农村电气化计划已开始实施，预计在三年内完成，届时，全苏联的国家农场（不包括集体农场）将全部电气化。\n    在捷克，共产党与社会民主党已于六月二十七日正式合并为捷克斯洛伐克统一共产党，合并以后，该党在议会的三百议席中拥有二百三十七席。\n    西欧方面：意大利总工会号召的半日总罢工，已于七月二日在全意开始举行。这次罢工的目的，是为了普遍增资并反对加斯贝利政府解雇工人和关闭工厂的政策。这是一次分期举行的总罢工。七月二日的罢工以运输业工人为中心，参加这次罢工的各业工人，“估计有三百万人”（合众社）。此后，在自七月六日至九日的四天内，还有化学、电力、钢铁、煤气等各业工人的全国罢工。英国伦敦码头工人的罢工，在坚持十六天之后，已于六月三十日自动结束。英伦的这次罢工，表明了英国工人正在“离开”“维护资产阶级利益而不是维护工人阶级利益”的反动工会的领导（真理报）。德国大柏林区苏军司令于二日致函美英法三方司令，谴责他们应对破坏柏林盟军司令部的工作负责，并声明盟军参谋部苏方参谋长不可能再出席盟军参谋部会议。\n    参加“马歇尔计划”的西欧十六国，已相继与美国签订了所谓“双边协定”，套上了“美元的枷锁”。截至七月三日为止，美国已与法国、意大利、爱尔兰、英国、挪威、比利时、荷兰、奥地利、丹麦、卢森堡、蒋介石政府等十四国签字。在这些协定的谈判过程中，美国始则向各国发出“语气专横”的草约，继则以“中断援助”相威胁，迫使受国家迅速承认奴役它们的条件。英、法等国的统治者，虽曾对这些苛刻条件表示不满，但它们终于在美国压力下可耻地屈服了。但是，这些国家的人员，对于这“可耻的奴役条约”，却发出了强烈的抵制呼声。法共领袖杜克宣布：法共“将对马歇尔计划以及一切与之有关的事情作斗争”。意共总书记托格里亚蒂亦已宣布：意共二百五十万党员，将以全力进行反对“马歇尔计划”的斗争。\n    美洲方面：一个新的反帝政党——人民党，最近在中美洲国家墨西哥成立。尽管反动当局曾多方阻挠，但该党现已拥有党员三十六万人。人民党首任主席、墨西哥著名工运领袖托列达诺，在该党成立大会上宣称：新党将为自由、主权与独立的墨西哥而奋斗。新党宣言反对危害拉丁美洲国家独立的美国扩张。\n    远东方面：日共及进步势力在工会领导机构的选举中又获新胜利。在全日国营递信（交通）工人工会（拥有会员四十万人）临时全国代表大会新选出的四十四名中央委员中，日共党员及左翼分子占百分之五十六，右派仅占百分之十一。青年人民左翼联盟领袖土侨一吉连任该工会主席。三名副主席中，有两名系日共党员。\n    越南民主共和国国防部长武元甲发表声明说：越盟之军火生产正日益增加中，足够不间断的供应武装部队，并能制造各种式样的现代化武器。\n    　　　　　　　　　　（新华社陕北九日电）"

    "content": "Taihang Fourth District Restores Embankments and Controls Rivers\nIncreasing Paddy Fields by 20,000 Mu\nAn'yang's Nanbeiguxian Villages Cooperate to Build Canals\n\n[Taihang News] The Taihang Fourth District completed its spring embankment restoration and river control work before the wheat harvest, achieving an increase of 20,000 mu of paddy fields, a reduction of flood-affected area of 50,000 mu, and an increase in grain production of 45,000 shi. The flood season was the most distressing issue for local farmers, especially in recent years, as the enemy and puppets continuously destroyed and devastated the area, causing the riverbeds to be unmaintained and severely silted up. Last year, Qin (Yang) and Wen (County) suffered from floods, submerging over 100,000 mu of autumn crops. This spring, in addition to providing relief and organizing production locally, the democratic government, based on the urgent needs of the masses, led the people in Wen (County), Qin (Yang), Bo (Ai), and Wu (Zhi) counties to restore embankments and control rivers, completing the original plan in three months. In the Qin River, 34 dangerous sections were repaired, with a total length of 4,727 zhang, using 13,852 cubic meters of earth. 55 new retaining structures were built, 60 retaining structures were added or repaired, and 12 earth oxen were erected, totaling 31,885 workdays, using 2.27 million jin of materials, 855 straw ropes and reed ropes, 4,668 small wooden stakes, 285 large sign stakes (3.2 zhang long), and 497 jin of ramie and hemp thread (the above figures are statistics from Qin, Wen, and Wu counties). In the Dan River, a major dangerous project was built at Jiangling Fort, including a 48-zhang-long large stone dam, using 39,844 earthworkers, stoneworkers, and craftsmen, 9 million jin of stones, 2.25 million jin of lime, 250,000 jin of coal, and 220,000 jin of firewood. The Guangji River was also completed at this time, increasing paddy fields by 20,000 mu (see page one of this newspaper on June 20). In addition, 3,810 zhang of the Hehe River (small main river) were dredged, using 15,169 workdays. 25,390 zhang of the Menhe River (small tributary) were dredged, using 38,169 workdays. 720 zhang of the Da Gan River were dredged, using over 9,000 workdays. This year, Wen and Qin counties jointly dredged six large flood rivers (hanging water channels), ranging from 50 to 120 li in length. The flood rivers had been silted up for many years, and the banks had become waterlogged wasteland. Last year, approximately 100,000 mu of autumn fields were flooded. After this year's organized repairs, approximately 56,914 workdays were used. It is estimated that this year, the flood-affected autumn fields can be reduced by more than 50,000 mu.\n\nThe construction of the above four rivers cost a total of 172,050 jin of grain and 193,541 workdays, increasing paddy land by 20,000 mu (which could not be planted in the past due to lack of water). At one shi per mu, production can be increased by 20,000 shi; reducing flooded land by 50,000 mu, with each mu producing five dou more than last year, a total increase of 25,000 shi can be achieved. In total, this year's production can be increased by 45,000 shi. After the embankment restoration and river control, the masses said, \"This year, the democratic government has grasped our heart's worries.\"\n                                        (Taihang Fourth District Cooperation Section Hao Shengyun)\n\n[Taihang News] An'yang Sixth District Nanbeiguxian Villages, with the support of the democratic government, cooperated to build canals, expanding irrigated land by more than 2,000 mu, and resolved the famine problems of some of the masses with grain loans. Nanbeiguxian are two villages in the Sixth District with relatively more dry land, totaling 4,131 mu, with 1,108 mu of irrigated land. The 328 mu of irrigated land in Beiguxian often could not be watered, and in reality, only the 700-plus mu of land in Nanguxian could be irrigated. The initial wells were four or five zhang deep, and five people could not irrigate even one mu per day on average, costing a lot of labor. Later, the canal wells were dug from the Datong Canal in the northeast of the village, and the wells were 1.5 zhang deep. Five people could irrigate two to three mu per day, saving much more labor than before. However, the soil of the Datong Canal was not good and collapsed every year, and the masses had a request to renovate the canal. This spring, the cadres of the two villages met and invited several old men who had worked on water conservancy in the past to discuss and make plans together. Nanguxian Village advocated that the canal should flow to the east of the village this time, while Beiguxian advocated that it should flow to the west of the village. After repeated discussions, both parties agreed to set up a water diversion point in the south of Nanguxian Village, with one stream flowing to the northeast of Nanguxian Village and one stream flowing due north, which was suitable for irrigating land in both villages. The masses said, \"It's good, but we really have difficulty with food.\" Upon hearing this, the leaders sent Section Chief Ma of the County Government Cooperation Section to personally help the masses measure the canal, organize laborers, and solve various specific difficulties. The government approved an allocation of 20,000 jin of canal construction loan grain, and rice was immediately distributed, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the masses to build the canal. At this time, a canal construction committee was established to be responsible for leading the canal construction. In order to accelerate work efficiency, a contracting method was studied in advance, and different wage rates were determined according to the different depths of the wells. When repairing, priority was given to disaster victims, refugees, and the poor who had no way to live, and there were no village restrictions. People from other villages could also participate, thus solving the famine problems of some people. Starting from March 26, in less than a month, a canal of 1,129 zhang long was dug, expanding irrigated land by 2,000 mu.\n                                        (Correspondent Team Li Shang, Chen Donghai, Wan Niuxian)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行四分区复堤治河　增加水田两万亩　安阳南北固现村合力修渠\n\n1948-07-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行四分区复堤治河\n    增加水田两万亩\n    安阳南北固现村合力修渠\n    【太行讯】太行四分区今春复堤治河工作，在麦收前全部完成，获得增加水田两万亩，减少水患五万亩，增加产粮四万五千市石的成绩。河水汛期为当地农民最感苦恼的一件事，特别是近年以来，敌顽不断破坏摧残，河身失修，淤塞厉害，去年沁（阳）温（县）两县遭受水灾，淹没秋禾达十万余亩。民主政府今春除在当地设法救济和组织生产外，特根据群众迫切需要，在温（县）、沁（阳）、博（爱）、武（陟）四县领导群众复堤治河，三个月完成原定计划。计在沁河修筑险工三十四处，长四、七二七丈，用土方一三、八五二方。新筑埽台五十五个，加厢埽台（修补）六十个，屯土牛十二个，共用工三一、八八五个，用料二二七万斤，草绳、苇绳八五五条，小木桩四、六六八根，大签桩（三丈二尺长）二八五根，菁麻线麻四九七斤（以上数字是沁温武三县的统计）。丹河修筑江陵堡大险工一处，长四十八丈的大石坝一段，用土工、石工、匠工等三九、八四四个，石头九百万斤，石灰二二五万斤，煤炭二五万斤，木柴二二万斤。广济河亦于此时兴修完竣，增加水田两万亩（见六月二十日本报一版）。此外并挑和河（小干河）三、八一○丈，用工一五、一六九个。挑门河（小支河）二五、三九○丈，用工三八、一六九个。挑大干河七二○丈，用工九千余个。温、沁两县今年共同疏通六条大涝河（挂水渠），长五○里至一二○里不等，涝河多年淤塞，两岸尽成水淹荒田，去年约淹秋田十万余亩，经过今年组织开修，约用工五六、九一四个。估计今年可减少水淹秋田五万余亩。\n    修筑以上四河，共开支粮一七二、○五○斤，用工一九三、五四一个，增加水地两万亩（过去无水不能种），每亩以一市石计，可增产两万石；减少淹地五万亩，每亩比去年多产五市斗，共可增产两万五千市石，总共今年能增产四万五千市石。修堤治河以后，群众说：“民主政府今年抓住了咱们的心病”。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（太行四专合作科郝升云）\n    【太行讯】安阳六区南北固现村在民主政府扶持下合力修渠，扩大水地两千余亩，并以贷粮解决了部分群众的灾荒问题。南北固现是六区旱地较多的两个村，共地四一三一亩，有一一○八亩水地。北固现的三二八亩水地经常浇不到水，实际只南固现的七百余亩地能浇水。起初的水井都有四、五丈深，五个人一天平均浇不了一亩，费工很多。后来从村东北大同渠挖透渠井，井深一丈五尺，五个人一天能浇二亩至三亩，比过去省工多了。但大同渠土质不好，年年倒塌，群众都有改修渠道的要求。今年春天，两村干部碰了头，找来过去搞过水利的几个老汉，共同商量，作了计划。南固现村主张这次修渠要往村东流水，北固现则主张往村西头流。经过反复酝酿圪扯，双方同意在南固现村南设一分水口，一股水向南固现村东北流，一股水向正北流，两村浇地都很合适。群众说：“好倒是好，就是吃食实在困难。”领导上听到这个意见，便派县府合作科马科长亲自帮助群众测量水渠，组织民工，解决各种具体困难。政府批准拨给二万斤修渠贷粮，立刻发下米来，群众修渠劲头越大了。这时成立了修渠委员会，负责领导修渠。为了加速工作效率，事先研究了包工办法，按照井的不同深度，决定不同的工资米。修时先尽生活无办法的灾民、难民和贫民来修，不为村限制，别村的人也可参加，这样就解决了一部分人的灾荒问题。从三月二十六日起，不到一月，已将长一一二九丈的水渠挖成，扩大了水地两千亩。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（通讯组李尚、陈东海、万牛先）"

    "content": "Circular of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee (Gong Zi No. 1)\nConcerning the abolition of the road pass system in the consolidated areas, this order is issued to all levels of government agencies.\n\n　　Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to prevent enemy agents and spies from infiltrating the liberated areas to carry out sabotage, a road pass system has been implemented for traveling pedestrians. This played a significant role in ensuring the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and protecting the safety of the people at that time. Now, the armed enemies in the interior of our North China liberated areas have been basically eliminated, and the war has been directed to the border areas or enemy-occupied areas. The vast interior has been completely united, and it is no longer necessary to continue this road pass system. On the contrary, it restricts the movement of people and business activities and hinders economic development. For this reason, it is hereby ordered that the road pass system be abolished in all consolidated areas. Merchants and people are free to migrate and travel. No troops, agencies, or organizations may obstruct them unless required by law. However, border areas should still pay close attention to preventing the activities of enemy agents and spies.

    "content": "Western European Countries are Shackled by the US Dollar!\n    Izvestia Comments on \"Bilateral Agreements\"\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th] TASS, February: The Soviet newspaper Izvestia published an article titled \"The Dollar Shackles of Western European Countries,\" stating that the United States is currently signing so-called bilateral agreements on the conditions of \"aid\" with each of the sixteen Western European countries individually. (Note: In addition to the previously reported bilateral agreements between the United States and Britain, France, Italy, Ireland, and Norway that have already been signed, bilateral agreements between the United States and Belgium, the Netherlands, and Austria were also signed on the 2nd). These agreements are nothing more than dollar shackles, aimed at reducing the economic independence of those countries that pin their hopes on American \"aid.\" To prevent any collective opposition from the sixteen countries to the conditions of \"aid,\" the United States prefers to negotiate with each country individually, as this makes these countries more docile and easier to impose harsh enslavement conditions upon. The Western European \"recipient\" countries are bound by specific obligations during the four-year term of the agreement, while the United States is not bound by the same obligations (Note: The US foreign aid plan is now stipulated to be decided annually by Congress). As a result, Western European countries will not be able to plan their economic lives, and their economies will depend on the policies of the United States and the economic changes that may occur at any time. This has already been proven by the recent decision of the US Congress to reduce foreign aid appropriations. Therefore, the so-called \"bilateral agreements\" are actually unilateral and unequal enslavement treaties. The content of the \"bilateral agreements\" will surely open the eyes of many people, allowing them to finally see the consequences of the rulers of the sixteen Western European countries participating in the Marshall Plan against the will of the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西欧各国套上了美元枷锁！　消息报评“双边协定”\n\n1948-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西欧各国套上了美元枷锁！\n    消息报评“双边协定”\n    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社二月讯：苏联消息报以“西欧各国的美元枷锁”为题撰文称：美国目前正与西欧十六国个个国家分别签订关于“援助”条件的所谓双边协定（按：除前已报导的美国与英、法、意、爱尔兰、挪威五国的双边协定业已签字外，美国与比、荷、奥的双边协定亦已于二日签字）。这些协定不过是一种美元枷锁，目的在于消减那些把命运寄托于美“援”的国家之经济独立。美国为了防止十六国对“援助”条件的任何集体反对，宁愿个别地与各国谈判，因为这样可使这些国家更驯服，更易于强加以严厉的奴役条件。西欧受“援”国在协定的四年期内，均负有确定的义务，而美国则不受同样义务的约束（按：美国“援”外计划，现规定由国会逐年决定），其结果，西欧各国将不能计划其经济生活，它们的经济将取决于美国政策和经济随时可能发生的变化，这已为美国会最近削减“援外”拨款的决定所证明。因此，所谓“双边协定”实际上是片面的不平等的奴役条约。“双边协定”的内容定将打开许多人的眼界，使他们最后地看到了西欧十六国统治者违反人民意志参加马歇尔计划的后果。"

    "content": "[Taihang News] After the Party rectification and democratic supplementation campaign in Shili Village, Guan San District, the land problem has been resolved and a democratic system has been initially established. At the beginning of last month, the village concentrated all its efforts on shifting to a production campaign. The steps and processes of the village's transition to production are reported as follows:\n\nAfter the Party rectification and supplementation, the masses' emotions generally tended to stabilize, and all classes tended to unite. However, many people did not know what to do or how to do it in the future. Branch Secretary Xiang You Shun and Deputy Branch Secretary Xiang Ti Shui (a labor hero) first explained to the masses that the Party's policy is to mobilize everyone to engage in production properly and become prosperous. The current requirements are to hoe the seedlings well (general hoeing three times) and apply topdressing to achieve an increase of three *sheng* of refined grain per *mu*. Agriculture and sideline occupations should be closely integrated to achieve sufficient food and clothing. At the same time, it was explained that feudalism had been thoroughly eliminated, the poor and hired peasants had been liberated, and there would be no more struggles in the future. Landlords and rich peasants will also be guaranteed if they develop their families through labor. The branch secretary also reviewed the forced and unreasonable phenomena in the past combination of agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support, and announced that re-establishing voluntary cooperation: who wants to help whom is entirely up to them. Everyone had a clear understanding of the direction and practices for the future, and their emotions became more stable, and they were all prepared to wholeheartedly engage in production.\n\nNext, the leftover problems in the past mutual assistance were reviewed and resolved, and the mutual assistance was rectified. First, the masses were allowed to think freely, to say whatever they wanted, and to say it however they wanted. The masses raised many opinions, some of which were opinions on the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, and some expressed dissatisfaction with unfairness in mutual assistance. For example, farmer Xiang Fu Ze said, \"The agricultural wage is four *jin* of rice a day, but when the dividends are distributed, I can't even get two *jin*. There is no shortage of labor in agriculture, and sideline occupations also make a lot of money, but I just can't get dividends.\" De Zhen said, \"Livestock earn an average of 400 yuan per work-day, but only 300 yuan are distributed as dividends.\" Xiang Ti Shui said, \"My team has the most dividends, with livestock earning 400 yuan per work-day, but it costs 360 yuan to eat two *sheng* of feed a day, so those who raise livestock will have to sell them.\" Zhao Yang Fu said, \"We do agricultural work for others, and we do it all at once; if we stop for a period, and they spin some cotton, they use that to offset what they owe us.\" (His meaning was that he should be paid wages immediately after work.) Ma You's wife said, \"We weave good cloth, but we can't get good cloth as dividends, so we don't weave good cloth anymore. We just want to be fast. Anyway, one *zhang* of cloth counts as one work-day, so we just weave enough.\" Ti Guo said, \"When good cloth is woven, the small cooperative sells it, and the bad cloth is used for dividends. We wear bad cloth and pay a high price. I have a surplus of 154 work-days and only got one *zhang* and seven *chi* of cloth and 500 yuan.\" Someone pointed out, \"The agricultural wage is four *jin* of rice, worth 800 yuan. Spinning half a *jin* of cotton is equivalent to one agricultural work-day, but it only earns more than 400 yuan. Weaving one *zhang* of cloth is also equivalent to one agricultural work-day, but it only earns 500 yuan. Agriculture is seasonal, while spinning and weaving are long-term. Prices fluctuate, making it difficult to calculate accounts, so men can't get dividends and women can't wear cloth.\" Some people criticized the unfair and unreasonable reward and dividend distribution in the past. For example, poor peasant Quan Xing didn't do a single work-day in agriculture but spun only one *jin* of cotton in sideline occupations, and he was awarded 10,000 yuan. Middle peasant Yu Ze earned 50 work-days in agriculture and 140 work-days in spinning and weaving, but he didn't get a single penny in awards. When evaluating thread, middle peasant Xin Quan and An Gen's wife spun first-class thread but were rated as third-class. Poor peasants Quan Xing and You Fu's wife spun thread that was not even as good as second-class, but they were rated as first-class. Poor peasant Xian Ying once said, \"Even if I close my eyes and draw [a thread], I don't have to worry about getting a first-class rating!\" Middle peasant Huai Fu's wife scolded her daughter, saying, \"Spin faster! No matter how well you spin, it's still third-class!\" Quan Xing's wife, a poor peasant, got a reward for spinning one *jin* of cotton, while Huai Fu's wife, a middle peasant, didn't get a reward for spinning eleven *jin*, and the masses felt it was unreasonable. Even the people who got the awards didn't feel honored. Regarding the merger of spinning and weaving, most of the masses believed that \"three families rely on each other and overturn the stove.\" \"It's like working for others.\" Before the merger, Ti Guo's group of nine people spun 80 *jin* of cotton and wove 45 *zhang* of cloth in three months, averaging more than eight *jin* of spinning and more than five *zhang* of weaving per person. After the merger, 29 people spun 110 *jin* and wove 130 *zhang* of cloth in three months, averaging only more than three *jin* of spinning and more than four *zhang* of weaving per person. Before the merger, one *jin* of thread could weave nine *chi* and five *cun* to one *zhang* of cloth, which was fine, smooth, and white. After the merger, one *jin* of thread wove eight *chi* of cloth, which was thick, black, and bumpy. In addition, the middle peasants' shares in the cooperative, including 90,000 yuan and more than 900 *jin* of grain, were \"squeezed\" to give to the poor and hired peasants, which also affected the production mood.\n\n    　　　　Raise Opinions, Discuss, and Reasonably Solve Leftover Problems\n\nThe masses raised so many opinions, and after three days of group deliberation, they were finally discussed and resolved at a village-wide mass meeting. Issues that could be resolved immediately, such as the \"squeezed\" shares and grain of middle peasants, which were still in the cooperative, should be returned in full immediately. For methods that were inappropriate in the past, the masses discussed and changed them. For example, since spinning and weaving did not combine well with agriculture, and everyone wanted to separate, they were divided into groups according to everyone's opinions, spinning and weaving on their own. The women said that they would definitely be able to wear good cloth if they were separated and that nothing would be wasted. Some men were afraid that separation would be inconvenient for agriculture, so they also discussed a solution: during the busy farming season, women could stop spinning and weaving and participate in agricultural production, offsetting agricultural work based on labor, and sharing agricultural dividends. Some problems that could not be solved now, such as the unfair and unreasonable awards and thread evaluations in the past, were, first, because the money had been spent and the grain had been eaten and could not be recovered; second, it was also impossible to re-evaluate each household and each time, so the cadres reviewed their past wrong viewpoints and practices, explained that some people had indeed suffered losses, admitted that what people had said was correct, and apologized. Although material compensation could not be made, the masses felt much better than before. Regarding the problem of equivalent labor for agricultural and sideline occupations, there had not been any major unfairness in the past except for spinning and weaving. For example, no one paid a grain wage in agriculture, and each work-day earned an average of 150 yuan. If they were not organized, they would not be able to squeeze out labor, and even that 150 yuan would not be earned. As long as labor is equivalent in the future, there will be no problems. He said, \"If we don't implement the three-way combination, what will happen when we are assigned tasks during weeding? Not to mention not being able to engage in sideline occupations, the land will also be deserted.\" Xiang Fu Shu said, \"Don't just say that we earn more and get less dividends, don't you think about how many work-days were missed due to participation in the war?\"\n\nAfter solving the old problems, everyone discussed future practices and agreed to continue the combination, but advocated that agriculture, sideline occupations, and war support should all use work tickets, and finally the accounts should be settled according to the work tickets, which is simple and convenient. It was also determined that agriculture should be the main focus in the future, squeezing out a portion of the labor force to engage in full-group sideline occupations. The remaining scattered sideline occupations should be carried out by each person individually. Then everyone broke up the original teams and groups and re-established voluntary cooperation. The masses all discussed with each other, \"We must get it right this time with those who didn't agree with us before.\" Some encouraged each other, \"We must freely help each other in production, but don't voluntarily lie down and voluntarily break up.\" After clarifying the purpose of mutual assistance, everyone went home to consider and find partners. After a day of activity, the village's five teams became eight teams, and the sixteen groups became eighteen groups, some of which were reduced and some of which were expanded. The original third team automatically divided into three teams, and each team divided into three groups, becoming small-scale mutual assistance, and everyone was energetic. In the past, it was impossible to call everyone together to work, but now there is no need to call them, and everyone is standing in the field as soon as it gets light. The first team was originally five groups, but everyone thought it was difficult to adjust with so few people, so they discussed merging into three groups, and they are also working very energetically. The San Fu group is planning to hoe the seedlings and also split up four people to pull coal and one person to transport. The He Si team used to not have anyone pulling coal properly, but now there are often six carts pulling. One group in the original fourth team had ideological problems and wanted to break up, so they were allowed to break up, and they can combine again when they are willing in the future. This way everyone is happy.\n\nAfter rectifying the mutual assistance, several responsible cadres first put forward preliminary opinions on the production plan based on the demands of the masses and actual conditions, and then the entire cadre and group leader discussed it, and finally the masses discussed and formulated a detailed and specific production plan. The Party members also helped to lead and promote in different areas. Of the 22 Party members, 13 were elected as cadres to lead production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解决遗留问题团结互助生产　十里村贯彻自愿等价  说明封建彻底消灭以后再不进行斗争  重新自愿结合互助全村团结计划生产\n\n1948-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解决遗留问题团结互助生产\n    十里村贯彻自愿等价\n    说明封建彻底消灭以后再不进行斗争\n    重新自愿结合互助全村团结计划生产\n    【太行讯】＠关三区十里村经过整党民主填补运动，土地问题已经解决，民主制度初步建立，即于上月初集中全力，转入生产运动。现将该村转入生产的步骤与经过情形报导如下：\n    整党填补后，群众情绪一般趋于安定了，各阶层趋于团结。但有许多人不知以后要干什么，怎样干。支书向有顺与副支书向提水（劳动英雄）二同志便首先向群众讲明：我党的政策，是发动大家好好生产，发家致富。当前要求好好锄苗（普锄三遍），上追肥，达到每亩增产细粮三升。农副业紧密结合起来，做到足衣足食。同时说明封建已经彻底消灭，贫雇都已翻身，以后再不斗争。地主富农以后劳动发家，也一样保障。支书并对过去农业、副业、战勤三大结合中的强制与不合理现象作了检讨，宣布重新自愿结合，谁愿和谁一块互助，完全听便。大家对今后的方向和做法明确了，情绪更加安定，都准备一心一意闹生产。\n    接着就检讨与解决过去互助中遗留的问题，整顿互助。先是让群众自由思想，有什么话都说，想怎么说就怎么说。群众提出好多意见，其中有的是对农副业结合上的意见，有的是对互助中的不公道表示不满。如农民向富则说：“农业工资是一天四斤米，分红时连二斤也分不上；农业上并不缺工，副业上也不少赚钱，就是分不上红”。得珍说：“牲口每工平均赚四百元，分红时只分三百元。”向提水说：“我这队分红最多，牲口每工分四百元，可是一天吃二升料，就得花三百六，这样喂牲口的非卖不行。”赵羊付说：“咱给人家做农业生活，是一下就做了；停了一个时期，人家纺了些花，就给咱顶了。”（他的意思是做了工马上使工资。）马有媳妇说：“咱织上好布分不上好布，后来就不织好布啦。光图快。反正一丈布顶一个工，织够数就行。”提果说：“织上好布，小型社就卖了，下坏布合才分红。穿的是坏布，出的是大价钱，我余下一百五十四晌工，只分了丈七布，五百元钱。”有人提出：“农业工资四斤米，值八百元，纺半斤花顶一个农业工，但只赚四百多元，织一丈布也顶一个农业工，但只赚五百元。农业是应时的，纺织是长期的；物价涨落不定，很难算帐，弄得男人分不上红，女人穿不上布。”有人批评过去提奖分红不公平合理，比如：贫农全兴农业上没出一工，副业上只纺了一斤花，却奖了一万元；中农雨则农业赚下五十个工，纺织赚下一百四十晌，却没得上一个钱的奖。评议线子时，中农新全和安根媳妇纺的是头等线，评的是三等；贫农全兴与有付媳妇纺的连二等线也比不上，却评的是头等。贫农仙英曾说：“咱圪挤（闭）住眼抽出来也不愁评个头等线！”中农怀付媳妇骂着闺女说：“你快点纺吧！纺的怎好也是个三等！”贫农全兴妻纺了一斤花得了奖，中农怀付妻纺了十一斤也没得奖，群众觉得不合理，得奖人自己也觉得不光荣。对于纺织合并，大部群众认为是“三家相靠，倒了锅灶。”“是给旁人干哩。”提果组在未合并前，九个人三个月纺八十斤花，织四十五丈布，每人平均纺八斤多，织五丈多；合并后，二十九人三个月纺一百一十斤，织一百三十丈，每人平均只纺三斤多，织四丈多。未合并前一斤线能织九尺五到一丈布，又细又平又白；合并后一斤线织八尺布，又粗又黑又有圪塔。此外，中农在合作社入的股金，有九万元钱与九百多斤粮食“挤”给贫雇，也影响了生产情绪。\n    　　　　提出意见大家讨论合理解决遗留问题\n    群众提出这许多意见，经过三天小组酝酿，最后在全村群众大会上讨论解决。能够马上解决的，如“挤”了中农股金与粮食，还在合作社，应即全部退还。过去办法不合适的，由群众讨论改变：如纺织与农业不好结合，大家愿意分开，便依照大家意见，分成小组，自纺自织。妇女们说分开一定能穿好布，也浪费不了东西。有些男人怕分开对农业不方便，也讨论出解决办法：农忙时妇女们可停止纺织，参加农业生产，按活顶农业工，分农业红。有些现在无法解决的问题，如过去提奖与评议线子不公平、不合理，一来是钱花了粮吃了，无法追回；二来是重新一户户、一次次的评议也不可能，就由干部检讨自己过去错误的观点与做法，说明某些人的确吃了亏，承认人家提的正确，赔个不是，虽然不能进行物质补偿，群众却觉得比以前痛快多了。农副业等价变工问题，过去除了纺织，还没有大的不公。比如农业上谁也没出一粒工资米，每工平均就赚来一百五十元，要不组织起来，就挤不出劳力去，连这一百五也赚不上。今后只要劳力等价，就没有问题了。何的说：“要不实行三结合，正锄地时候派下差来怎么办？不用说不能搞副业，地也要荒了。”向付书说：“不能光说赚的多分的少，就不想想参战误了多少工？”\n    解决了旧问题后，大家便讨论以后的作法，都同意继续结合，但主张农业、副业、战勤都用工票，最后按工票算帐，简单方便。又确定以后以农业为主，挤出一部分劳力搞全组的副业。其余零碎副业，各人单独搞各人的。接着大家就打乱原来的队与组，来了个重新自愿结合。群众都互相议论：“以前心思不投的，这回一定要弄对劲。”有的互相劝勉：“咱们要自由互助生产，可不要自愿躺倒自愿散。”弄清楚互助的目的，大家都回家考虑，自找对象。经过一天的活动，全村五个队变成了八个队，十六组变成了十八组，其中有的缩小，有的扩大。原第三队自动分成了三个队，每队又分了三组，成了小型互助，大家都起劲。以前做活叫也叫不到一堆，现在不用叫，天刚明就都站在地头上了。第一队原来是五个小组，大家嫌人少不好调剂，就商量着并成三组，干得也很起劲。三付组一面计划锄苗，一面即分出四人去拉煤，一人去运输。河四队以前谁都不好好拉煤，现在经常有六辆车拉。原第四队有一组思想不通，要散伙，就让它散了，以后愿意了再结合。这样大家都痛快。\n    整顿好互助，便由几个负责干部先根据群众要求与实际条件提出关于生产计划的初步意见，又经全体干部、组长讨论，最后由群众讨论，订定了详细具体的生产计划。党员也都分片帮助领导推动。二十二个党员，有十三个当选为领导生产的干部。"

Although the early autumn crops have been planted, replanting wheat fields with late autumn crops has become very difficult. This year, there are more replanted wheat fields (for example, in Yangcheng's first district, wheat fields account for six-tenths of all cultivated land).

It stated: \"As the saying goes: 'If the autumn harvest is not good, just look at the 26th,' today (July 5th) is already the 29th day of the fifth lunar month, and there has been no thorough rain. Many people are still waiting for rain to plant late autumn crops. If they miss the farming season, they will suffer great losses.\" The short article called on the masses in various regions to organize themselves to prevent drought, to carry water to plant if they can, and to open canals if they can, and not to delay matters by waiting for rain. It also pointed out: \"The masses in our region have rich experience in fighting against disasters in the past. We must carry forward past experiences and fight against the disasters that have occurred, and prevent the formation of new famines.\" Many villages in Jincheng and Yangcheng have put forward the slogan \"Defeat drought and prevent drought disaster,\" with men and women, old and young, working together to carry water and plant late autumn crops. Lichuan Village in Jincheng mobilized 858 full and semi-laborers to carry water to rush planting. In seven days, they planted 185 mu of corn, applying an average of 40 loads of manure per mu. In Yangcheng's Jiangli, Yangyi, and Liuchang villages, they started carrying water to plant on the 13th day of the fifth lunar month. According to statistics, about 1,000 men, women, and children participated. Men carried manure and water, while women and children dug holes and planted seeds. In more than ten days, they planted more than 2,000 mu of corn.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阳城晋城群众担水点种晚秋\n\n1948-07-11\n第1版()\n专栏：紧急动员抗旱备荒！\n\n　　阳城晋城群众担水点种晚秋\n    【太岳讯】入夏以来，太岳很多地方未落透雨，早秋虽已种上，但回茬麦地赶种晚秋，已发生了很大困难。今年回茬麦地又多（如阳城一区麦地占全耕地十分之六），因此防旱抢种，成为当前农业生产中的迫切任务。太岳新华日报于七月五日发表短论，号召各地农民进一步和灾害作斗争。据称：“常言道：‘秋收不收秋，单看二十六’，今天（七月五日）已是旧历五月二十九了，还没下透雨，不少群众还在等雨下种晚秋，如果错过农时，将会受到很大损失”。短论号召各地群众组织起来防旱，能担水点种的就点种，能开渠的就开渠，不要等雨误事。并指出：“我区群众和灾害作斗争，过去已有丰富的经验，要发扬过去经验和已发生的灾害作斗争，并预防新的灾荒的形成。”晋城、阳城不少村庄，已提出“战胜天旱，防止旱灾”的口号，男女老少一齐动手，担水点种晚秋。晋城犁川村动员了全半劳力八百五十八人担水抢种，七天点种玉茭一百八十五亩，每亩平均上到四十担粪。阳城匠礼、阳邑、留昌等村从阴历五月十三开始担水点种，统计有男人妇女儿童约一千多人参加，男人担粪担水，妇女儿童挖坑点籽，十多天功夫点种玉茭二千多亩。"

After each battle, political workers immediately conducted investigations and comforted the prisoners of war, tracking down anything they had lost. Political Commissar Gao Lin often personally talked with the prisoners of war to examine the implementation of the policy. For the wounded soldiers, he instructed the medical staff to apply medicine carefully. He especially told the troops guarding the prisoners of war to be kind in their attitude and to provide good food and drink. Due to the importance attached by the leadership, everyone automatically implemented the policy. The machine gun and artillery company took care of the prisoners of war, providing the same food, drink, and sleeping arrangements as their own, and actively promoted and explained the Party's policy and the current situation to the prisoners of war. Zhao Lian (currently a military instructor), who was liberated from Yangshanji, educated the prisoners of war with his own experience of the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army, which had a great impact. Warrior Wen Gan of the Seventh Company took two Gold Star pens from a wounded enemy squad leader at Liulizhuang. Realizing that this violated the policy, he put the pens back into the squad leader's pocket. Among the ninety-two prisoners of war reviewed by the regimental political office, none were subjected to insults, and nine wounded prisoners were well cared for.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黄河南岸一分区某团　认真执行俘虏政策\n\n1948-07-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黄河南岸一分区某团\n    认真执行俘虏政策\n    【冀鲁豫七日电】黄河南岸一分区某团，上月初旬，配合主力向津浦线出击战中，认真执行俘虏政策。每次战斗后，政工人员立即调查。慰问俘虏，丢了东西的马上追查。政委高林常亲自和俘虏谈话，考查政策执行情形。对伤兵，则嘱咐卫生员好好上药。对看管俘虏部队，特别告诉他们态度要和气，搞好吃喝。由于领导上的重视，大家都自动执行政策。机炮连照顾俘虏，吃、喝、睡全和自己一样，还积极向俘虏宣传解释党的政策和目前形势。羊山集解放过来的赵链（现任军事教员），并以对解放军宽大政策的亲身体验教育俘虏，影响很大。七连战士文干，在六里庄拿了敌负伤班长两支金星笔，他想到这是违犯政策的，于是又将笔插进该班长的口袋里。在团政所审查过的九十二个俘虏中，无一受到侮辱。并有九个伤俘被很好救护。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Combined foreign news agency reports: The Chiang and Fu gangs in Beiping are frantically massacring Northeast students in Beiping who are protesting persecution and hunger. Over a hundred students have been killed and wounded, and thirty-seven have been arrested, creating the biggest massacre of students in Beiping in over twenty years since the \"March 18th\" incident in 1926 when the Northern Warlords massacred students.\n\nUnder the threats and deception of the Chiang government, students who arrived in Beiping from the Shenyang area of the Northeast Chiang-controlled area were completely ignored by the Chiang government in terms of their lives and studies. \"Without clothes, food, housing, or books to read\" (according to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao). They were already filled with indignation towards the Chiang government. In addition, the Chiang-controlled Municipal Council unexpectedly passed a proposal to concentrate them for military training and \"stipulate the conscription of all Northeast students into the army\" (according to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 6th), preparing to drive them to serve as cannon fodder for the Four Families' anti-people civil war, and \"expel them from the Municipal Council Hall where they were temporarily residing\" (according to the same source). This aroused even greater anger among the Northeast students. On the morning of the 5th of this month, several thousand students (the Associated Press reported 5,000, and the United Press reported 3,000 to 4,000) from nine universities and one middle school in the Northeast marched to the Municipal Council to protest this absurd resolution. That afternoon, students gathered at the residence of Xu Huidong, the speaker of the Municipal Council, in Dongjiaomin Lane, demanding that Xu cancel the proposal to persecute students. The Chiang bandit military police were on high alert, deployed around Xu's residence, not allowing students to approach, and attacked students with stones, but the students remained unmoved. They persisted until evening, when the police authorities pretended to allow the matter to be handled the next day. As the students began to disperse and return home, the Chiang bandit garrison commander suddenly ordered the police, military police, and troops to open fire on the unarmed students, and a massacre of inhumane proportions began. According to a United Press reporter in Beiping, \"As the shooting suddenly and unexpectedly began, the reporter was standing at the forefront of a group of students. A boy next to me was shot in the abdomen and bled to death. Three students next to him were also injured and fell on the sidewalk.\" \"Students were crawling on the ground, and some students in the east began to run wildly. The reporter clearly saw the soldiers loading bullets and shooting at the fleeing students at the speed of fire.\" According to statistics released by the Northeast Student Federation cited by the Associated Press in Beiping on the 8th, over a hundred students were killed and wounded, including thirteen who were killed on the spot and died in the hospital after being seriously injured, and eighteen others were in critical condition. A total of one hundred people were injured, and thirty-seven were arrested. Another ten-year-old bystander was also shot dead.\n\nAfter committing this atrocity, the Chiang Kai-shek gang hastily buried the bodies of the murdered students, attempting to destroy the evidence, and locked the Northeast students in the various dilapidated temples where they were temporarily residing, depriving them of their freedom of movement and contact with the outside world. From the 6th, a city-wide curfew was declared, and the Chiang bandit Central News Agency, with blood in its mouth, slandered the unarmed students as \"rioters,\" claiming that the students fired first, and fabricated that \"military police casualties numbered over twenty, 'rioters' died three and were injured over ten\" (Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th). But shameless lies cannot cover up the facts of blood. The Associated Press dispatches on the 6th and 7th pointed out: \"According to the reporter's investigation in shops, restaurants, and other places, people from all walks of life believe that the official Central News Agency's report on this incident is completely distorted.\" \"After careful inquiry, six foreigners who witnessed the shooting said that none of them had seen any students firing a gun, or any military police casualties due to so-called student shootings.\" One witness said: \"The records in the local newspapers (referring to 'officially approved Central News Agency news') are all lies.\" Another United Press report on the 7th reported: \"The official Central News Agency reported only three student deaths, but Chinese reporters, a French reporter, and I saw five corpses last night, and the authorities had verified that these corpses were all students who had been beaten to death.\" The ugly and shamelessness of the rumor factory, Central News Agency, has once again been exposed before the people of the world.\n\n\tWidespread Student Anger and Support; Demand Immediate Execution of Murderers\n\tEight Universities Establish \"July 5th Incident\" Support Association\n\nThis crime of the Chiang and Fu gangs' brutal massacre of Northeast students is arousing the indignation of students everywhere. According to Associated Press reports from Beiping on the 7th and 8th: Students from eight universities in Beiping, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Beijing Normal University, Chaoyang College, Railway Management College, North China College, and Sino-French University, have established the \"Beiping Eight Universities July 5th Incident Support Association.\" Each of the eight universities sent one representative to form an eight-person committee to write to the Chiang government authorities, condemning this crime, and put forward solemn demands, including the immediate release of the arrested students, the execution of the murderers, and compensation for the funeral expenses, support funds, and medical expenses of the dead and injured students. The association has also sent letters to the World Student Association, calling for the righteous support of students from all countries, and issued a \"Letter to Compatriots Across the Country,\" which specifically pointed out that the killed students were killed with \"American-made bullets.\" According to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 7th: \"Observers generally expect that this shooting will cause a series of reactions from other student groups here.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北平发生廿年来最大惨案　蒋傅匪帮屠杀学生  反迫害的东北籍学生死伤百余人\n\n1948-07-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北平发生廿年来最大惨案\n    蒋傅匪帮屠杀学生\n    反迫害的东北籍学生死伤百余人\n    【新华社陕北十日电】综合外国通讯社消息：北平蒋、傅匪帮疯狂屠杀反迫害、反饥饿的东北来平学生，学生死伤一百余人，被逮捕三十七人，造成自一九二六年北洋军阀屠杀学生的“三一八”事件之后二十余年来北平最大一次屠杀学生的惨案。\n    在蒋政府威胁与欺骗下，由东北蒋管区沈阳一带抵达北平的学生，因蒋政府对他们的生活学业根本不管，“无衣无食，无处住，更无书读”（津大公报语）。他们对蒋政府本已满胸愤慨，再加上蒋记市参议会竟通过将他们集中军训、“规定征召全部东北学生当兵”的议案（据合众社北平六日电），准备驱迫他们充当四大家族反人民内战的炮灰，并“将他们从借住的参议会大厅驱逐外出”（据同上），这就引起了东北籍学生更大的愤怒。本月五日晨，东北九个大学及一个中学学生数千人（美联社报导为五千人，合众社报导为三、四千人），列队前往市参议会，抗议此一荒谬决议。当日下午，学生群集东交民巷该市参议会议长许惠东住宅，要求许将迫害学生的议案取消，蒋匪军警如临大敌，在许宅附近布岗，不许学生近前，并以石子袭击学生，但学生不为所动。坚持至傍晚，警察当局佯为允许明日再作处理，当学生开始散队回家时，蒋匪警备司令突命令警察、宪兵及军队向赤手空拳的学生开枪，一场灭绝人性的大屠杀即告开始。据合众社驻北平记者报导称：“当射击意外地突然开始时，记者正站在一群学生的前列，我身边的一个男孩子腹部中弹冒血毙命，他旁边的三个学生也受伤倒在人行道上”，“学生匍匐在地上，东面有一些学生开始狂奔，记者很清楚地看见士兵以上好子弹就开枪的速度，追着射击逃跑的学生”。据美联社北平八日电引据东北学联发表统计，学生死伤一百余人，其中当场被击毙和重伤入医院后毙命者十三人，且尚有十八人生命危险，受伤者共达一百人，被捕者三十七名，另一仅十岁的旁观小孩亦被击毙。\n    蒋介石匪帮制造此一惨案后，竟草草将死难学生尸首埋葬，妄图毁灭罪证，并将东北学生关闭在他们临时栖宿的各破庙中，剥夺其行动及与外界接触的自由。复自六日起宣布全市戒严，而蒋匪中央社则含血喷人，诬蔑赤手空拳的学生为“暴徒”，谓学生首先开枪射击，又无中生有谓“计军警死伤二十余人，‘暴徒’死三人，受伤十余人”（中央社北平五日电）。但无耻的谎言掩盖不了血的事实，美联社六、七两日电指出：“据记者赴商店、饭店及其他地方调查，各行各业的人都认为官方中央社关于这一事件的报导全部都是歪曲事实。”“记者缜密询问六位目击枪杀事件的外国人，没有一个人曾看见任何学生开枪，或由于所谓学生开枪而使军警有任何伤亡。”一位目击者称：“此间报上的记载（指‘官方批准的中央社消息’）全是谎话一篇。”另据合众社七日电报导：“官方的中央社报导仅死学生三人，但中国记者，一法国记者及我，昨晚曾看到五个尸首，而当局曾验出这些尸首全部是被打死的学生。”谣言工厂中央社的丑恶无耻又一次在全世界人民面前暴露。\n    　　　　广大学生愤慨声援　要求立即枪决凶手\n    　　八大学成立“七五事件”后援会\n    蒋傅匪帮此一残酷屠杀东北学生的罪行，正激起各地广大学生的愤慨。据美联社北平七、八日电报导：平市北大、清华、燕京、北平师范学院、朝阳学院、铁道管理学院、华北学院及中法大学等八个大学的学生，已成立“北平八大学七五事件后援会”，八大学各派代表一人组成八人委员会致函蒋政府当局，谴责此一罪行，并提出立即释放被捕学生，枪决凶手，赔偿死伤学生葬殓费，扶衅费及医药费等严正要求。该会并已致函世界学联，呼吁各国学生的正义声援，另发表“告全国同胞书”，书中特别指出，被杀死的学生是用“美制子弹”杀死的。据合众社北平七日电指出：“观察家大都预料这次射击将会引起此间其他学生团体一连串的反应。”"

According to a Central News Agency Beiping dispatch on the 6th, more than 8,000 Northeastern students from the KMT-controlled areas, deceived by the Chiang government, have arrived in Beiping. In Tianjin, according to the Dagong Bao on the 17th of last month, there are \"at least five or six hundred people.\" They have endured hardships to enter the interior for more than three months, but the Chiang government's promise to set up \"Temporary Northeastern University\" and \"Temporary Northeastern Middle School\" to accommodate them has not been fulfilled. A reporter from the Tianjin Yishi Bao reported on June 8th that the students who arrived in Tianjin, hungry and full of hope, first went to the Counseling Office (an agency established by the KMT Ministry of Education in name to \"relieve\" students) to register, but the Counseling Office said that the registration forms and relief funds were all used up, and told them to go to the Education Bureau to find a solution. So they went to the Education Bureau collectively, but neither the director nor the section chief was there. An employee said: \"The Education Bureau is powerless. Go to the Counseling Office!\" They were extremely saddened by this runaround. They waited in front of the Education Bureau with disappointment and anxiety. When the reporter left them at 6:00 p.m., they still had not eaten a grain of rice or a drop of water. Everyone's face was yellow and thin, and they spoke weakly. The situation for students in Beiping was even worse. The Dagong Bao said on the 17th of last month: \"Taking Beiping as an example, some large houses are left idle, while many Northeastern students sleep under the eaves of guild halls and live in the holes of city walls.\"\n\nIn contrast to the cold treatment of the Chiang government, the students, teachers, and workers of major middle schools in Beiping and Tianjin are enthusiastically helping them with brotherly affection and are actively raising donations for them. In Tianjin, students from Nankai University, Beiyang University, Hebei Institute of Technology, and Women's Normal College had raised more than 164 million KMT currency (hereinafter the same) for them by June 6th, which was first distributed to more than 150 students with the most economic difficulties, and they continued to expand fundraising for them. Many school teachers also donated money to them despite their own difficult living conditions. Teachers and students of Tianjin Municipal Normal School cut back on food and donated money for them. Twenty-five workers from Beiyang University donated more than 4 million. Workers from Renli Factory donated more than 2 million. Students from Women's Normal College, Nankai Girls' High School, and other schools gave them blankets, clothes, shoes, socks, stationery, and newspapers, and prepared to tutor middle school students. In addition to launching fundraising campaigns, students from Hebei Institute of Technology also fasted for one meal to help Northeastern students, and sent the remaining 500 steamed buns through four representatives to the Education Bureau to distribute to the dozens of students staying there. Several representatives also spoke to the Northeastern students, advising them to \"Don't be sad, don't be disappointed, show the appearance of young people.\" Students from the Institute of Physical Education, in addition to donating money and clothing, also sent representatives with letters to express their condolences and encourage them to \"Don't be pessimistic because of this. On the contrary, stand up more bravely and strongly!\" When batches of items saved or raised by the students of various schools were sent, \"These precious friendships moved the wanderers to tears.\" (The above information is from the Tianjin Yishi Bao from June 5th to 8th and the Tianjin Minguo Daily on June 6th)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 在平津的东北籍学生过着悲惨非人的生活  平津学生教师工友节食捐款援助慰问\n\n1948-07-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　在平津的东北籍学生\n    过着悲惨非人的生活\n    平津学生教师工友节食捐款援助慰问\n    【新华社华北十日电】据各方消息：流落平津的东北学生在过着非人的生活。受蒋政府欺骗抵达北平的东北蒋管区学生，据六日中央社北平电称已达八千余人，在天津的据上月十七日大公报说“至少也有五六百人”。他们千辛万苦进入关内三个多月，蒋政府所谓要筹办“东北临大”、“东北临中”收容他们的诺言一项也没有实现。六月八日天津益世报记者报导，抵达天津的学生饿着肚皮，满怀着希望，先去辅导处（按系蒋记教育部所设的挂名为“救济”学生的机关）登记，但辅导处说登记表和救济金都已用完了，叫他们到教育局去想办法。于是他们又集体前往教育局，找局长和科长都不在。某职员说：“教育局无能为力，你们到辅导处去吧！”戏弄得他们伤心之极。他们怀着失望而焦急的心情候在教育局门前，直到下午六时记者离开他们时，仍未进粒米滴水，每个人的脸色既黄且瘦，说话也是有气无力。到北平的学生情况更惨。上月十七日大公报说：“以北平为例，若干大房子让它空闲着，而许多东北学生却睡会馆檐下，住城墙洞中。”\n    与蒋政府的冷酷对待相反的是平津各大中学学生，教师及工友，他们以兄弟般的情谊热烈的援助他们，纷纷为他们进行募捐。在天津方面，南开、北洋、冀工、女师学院四校学生，至六月六日已为他们募得一亿六千四百多万元蒋币（下同），先分配给经济最困难的一百五十多个同学，并继续为他们扩大募捐。许多学校的教师在生活困难中还捐款给他们。天津市立师范师生，为他们而节食捐款。北洋二十五位工友捐了四百多万。仁立工厂的工友们捐了二百多万。女师学院、南开女中等校学生纷纷以毯子、衣服、鞋袜、纸笔、书报等物品送给他们，并准备为中学生补习功课。河北工学院的学生为援助东北同学，除发动募捐外，且曾断食一餐，把剩下的五百个馒头，由四个代表送到教育局，分发给停留在那里的几十个学生，几个代表还向东北学生讲话，劝他们“不要伤心，不要失望，拿出青年人的样子来”。体专学生除捐赠款项衣物外，也派代表持函前往慰问鼓励他们“千万别因此消极悲观，相反的，要更勇敢、更坚强的站起来！”当各校同学把节约或募集得来的物品一批一批送来时，“这些珍贵的友情，使那些流浪者都感动得流下了眼泪”。（以上见六月五日至八日天津益世报及六月六日天津民国日报）"

The details of the meeting are as follows:\n    The meeting was jointly convened by Bo Yibo, Speaker of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly, and Cheng Fangwu, Speaker of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly. It officially opened on June 26th at the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government Office. The councilors present included Bo Yibo, Cheng Fangwu, Xing Zhaotang, Yu Li, Chao Zhefu, Wang Naitang, Yan Lixuan, Yang Gengtian, Pei Yuming, An Zairen, Zhao Mingfu, Zhang Huayi, Liu Junde, and Guo Dongchen, totaling fourteen people. This exceeded two-thirds of the total number of resident councilors from both regions, meeting the legal quorum. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, and Song Shaowen, Chairman of the Administrative Committee of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region, were invited to attend. Cheng Fangwu, Speaker of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly, was elected chairman of the meeting. In the harmonious atmosphere of the venue, Speaker Cheng announced the opening of the meeting and delivered a speech, stating: \"Due to the development of the liberation war, the two major liberated areas of Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan have been completely integrated. The division caused by the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek in the past no longer exists. In order to meet the political and economic demands of the people and further strengthen the various constructions in the North China Liberated Area, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's suggestion to merge the two major liberated areas in the north and south into the North China Liberated Area is timely and appropriate. The governments of the two regions should also be unified and merged into a unified government of North China. Therefore, the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China suggested that the resident organs of our two major liberated area assemblies discuss the appropriate steps for convening the North China Provisional People's Congress and establishing the North China United Government. After several discussions between Speaker Bo and myself, and joint research with Vice Speaker Xing, Vice Speaker Chao, and Vice Speaker Yu, it was decided to jointly convene a joint meeting of resident councilors from both regions to discuss the merger steps. I believe that the 45 million people of North China are looking forward to the rapid birth of a unified North China Democratic United Government, and today's meeting will be the starting point for realizing this requirement.\" After Speaker Cheng's speech, Mr. Xing Zhaotang, Vice Speaker of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Assembly, stood up and spoke first. He said: \"The merger of the two liberated areas and the merger of the two border region governments are very necessary. After the Japanese surrender, especially after our People's Liberation Army liberated Shijiazhuang, maintaining the artificial boundaries separated by the Zhengtai and Deshi Railways is unreasonable. This makes it extremely difficult for merchants and others to travel back and forth, and mutual blockades and taxation have reached an intolerable level. The proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is a measure that conforms to the will of heaven and responds to the people.\" He continued, \"Now the two border region governments are already working together, but this can only be said to be a transitional step towards the complete merger of the two border region governments and the establishment of a formal North China government. We must realize the complete unified North China government that the people of North China are longing for. Therefore, I fully agree with and support the proposal of the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China to convene the North China Provisional People's Congress to produce the North China government.\" Then, Mr. Yu Li, Vice Speaker of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly, spoke: \"Convening the North China Provisional People's Congress to produce the North China government is in line with democratic principles, because these two major liberated areas have expanded even more since the Japanese surrender, doubling in size compared to the Anti-Japanese War period. The two border region assemblies were both produced during the Anti-Japanese War period, and they do not adequately represent the current 45 million people in the North China Liberated Area. At the same time, there have been significant personnel changes among the councilors over the years. Therefore, it is appropriate to convene a provisional people's congress. I propose that the preparatory work for the provisional people's congress should be handled by the two border region governments that are already working together.\" Councilor Liu Junde said: \"In order to gather the strength of the people of North China and more powerfully support the front lines in order to win the victory of the People's Liberation War, it is very necessary to merge the two governments; the method of convening a provisional representative assembly to produce the North China United Government is also good.\" Councilor Guo Dongchen said: \"The people have long hoped for unification. During the Anti-Japanese War, separation was a last resort. Now, in order to facilitate commerce and benefit the people and the exchange of materials, I fully agree with everyone's opinions.\" Councilor An Zairen said: \"The democratic substance of the liberated areas has always existed, but the democratic form was very rudimentary in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. The election of the assembly was already much more complete. This decision to convene a provisional people's congress makes the democratic form even more complete. I think it is necessary and indispensable to build a new country.\" The elderly Councilor Yan Lixuan said: \"The merger of the two regions is very important. The Communist Party proposed convening a political consultative conference to establish a national democratic united government, and we are the first to respond.\" Councilor Wang Naitang said: \"I agree with the opinions of Mr. Xing and Mr. Yu. The unification of the two regional governments is not a requirement that only exists today; this need existed during the Anti-Japanese War. If the currency is not unified, the postal service is not unified, and materials cannot be exchanged, the people have long felt inconvenienced. However, this requirement is now even more urgent.\" Vice Speaker Chao Zhefu said: \"The merger of the two regions and the establishment of a unified government meet the needs of the people; convening a provisional representative assembly is a more complete democratic form than convening the two regional assemblies.\" Councilor Yang Gengtian said: \"When the provisional representative assembly is convened, the two regional governments should report to the assembly.\" Councilor Pei Yuming said: \"I agree with everyone's opinions. The provisional representative assembly should be prepared and convened quickly; according to legal procedures, the government should be responsible for the preparatory work.\" After three hours of enthusiastic discussion, everyone's opinions were completely consistent. Finally, Speaker Bo Yibo stood up and said: \"Today, all the councilors unanimously agree with the suggestion of the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China. I would like to thank everyone on behalf of the North China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China.\" Then he said: \"The merger of the two liberated areas into the North China Liberated Area and the merger of the two border region governments into the North China government are necessary for the people's lives and are completely permitted by objective circumstances. The past division was forced and unavoidable. Today, there is no basis to continue this artificial division.\" He continued, \"The North China Provisional People's Congress should be convened on the basis of an extremely broad anti-Chiang national united front. It should represent and unite all workers, peasants, independent laborers, intellectuals, the free bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, ethnic minorities, and all anti-American imperialist and anti-Chiang democratic forces in North China in order to produce the North China Democratic United Government.\" After he explained in detail the tasks and nature of the North China Provisional People's Congress and the future North China Democratic United Government, as well as the wishes of the Communist Party, he then highly praised the past work of the two regional assemblies. He said: \"During the Anti-Japanese War, the ten major policies proposed by the Communist Party were successively adopted by the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area Assemblies. For example, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei promulgated the Double Ten Program in 1940, and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan promulgated the Border Region Governance Program in 1941, as well as various policies and regulations such as rent reduction and interest reduction, streamlining troops and simplifying administration, developing production, and uniting people from all walks of life to resist Japan. All of these concentrated the opinions of the broad masses of the people, were proposed by our party, and were passed and adopted by the assembly, becoming the basis for the two liberated areas to persist in resisting Japan and defeat Japan, and also the basis for defeating Chiang's army's attacks and achieving continuous victories. The people of the two liberated areas are glorious, and the assemblies of the two liberated areas are also glorious.\" Speaker Bo finally emphasized: \"For eleven years, our party's unchanging policy has been to closely unite people from all walks of life to jointly defeat the enemies of the people, and to advocate the general policy of a New Democratic New China. In the future, we will continue to implement this general policy, organize the strength of the 45 million people in North China, and implement the call of our party Central Committee and the people's leader Mao Zedong to improve industrial and agricultural production by an inch in order to more powerfully strive for the liberation of all of North China and even all of China.\" After Speaker Bo's speech, the entire venue was extremely excited. Finally, Chairman Cheng, as the speaker, summarized the discussion results into two resolutions and submitted them to everyone for voting: (1) Agree to merge the two liberated areas into the North China Liberated Area, and merge the two border region governments into the North China Government. The two border region governments that are already working together are a transitional form of government transitioning to a completely unified North China Government. (2) The two border region governments that have already joined forces will immediately prepare for and quickly convene the North China Provisional People's Congress in order to produce the North China Unified Democratic United Government. It was unanimously approved by all resident councilors. The meeting lasted three hours and closed in an atmosphere of unity, harmony, and joy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫晋察冀边区参议会联席会议决议  召开华北临时人民代表大会  讨论产生统一的华北民主联合政府等问题\n\n1948-07-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫晋察冀边区参议会联席会议决议\n    召开华北临时人民代表大会\n    讨论产生统一的华北民主联合政府等问题\n    【本报特讯】华北广大解放区，已因人民解放军把战争引向蒋管区，而完全联成一片。为适应此种新形势及华北人民的要求，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两解放区参议会驻会参议员，于六月二十六日在石家庄举行联席会议。通过召开华北临时人民代表大会，产生统一的华北民主联合政府的重要决议。兹志会议经过如下：\n    会议由晋冀鲁豫边区参议会薄议长一波、晋察冀边区参议会成议长仿吾，联名邀集。于六月二十六日假石家庄市府办公厅，正式开会。计到会参议员薄一波、成仿吾、邢肇棠、于力、晁哲甫、王乃堂、阎力宣、杨耕田、裴毓明、安宅仁、赵明甫、张化夷、刘俊德、郭栋臣等十四人，超过两边区驻会参议员全额三分之二，达到法定开会人数。会议并邀请晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰、晋察冀边区行政委员会主任委员宋劭文列席。公推晋察冀边区参议会议长成仿吾主席，成议长在会场和谐的气氛中，即席宣布开会，并致词，略称：“由于解放战争形势的发展，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两大解放区已经完全联成一体，过去由日伪及蒋介石所造成的分割局面已不复存在。为适应人民政治经济上的要求，进一步加强华北解放区的各种建设，中共中央合并南北两大解放区为华北解放区的建议，切合时宜。两边区政府自亦应统一合并而为华北统一的政府。因而中共华北中央局又建议我两大解放区参议会驻会机关，商讨召开华北临时人民代表大会，成立华北联合政府的适当步骤。经薄议长与本人数度商讨，并与邢副议长、晁副议长、于副议长共同研究结果，乃确定联名召开两区驻会参议员联席会议，讨论合并的步骤。本人相信，华北四千五百万人民，正盼望着一个统一的华北民主联合政府的迅速诞生，今天这个会议将成为实现这个要求的起点。”成议长致词毕，晋冀鲁豫边区参议会副议长邢肇棠先生，首先起立发言，他说：“两解放区合并，两边区政府合并，十分必要。日本投降后，特别是我人民解放军解放石家庄后，仍然保持着为正太德石两路所隔开的人为界限，是不合理的，这使商民人等来往备受阻碍，相互封锁征税，已达到不能忍耐的程度，中共中央的提议是顺乎天而应乎人的举措。”继称：“现在两边区政府已经联合办公，但是这只能说是两边区政府完全合并，成立正式的华北政府的过渡步骤。必须实现华北人民所渴望的完全统一的华北政府。因此，我完全同意并拥护中共华北中央局召开华北临时人民代表大会产生华北政府的建议。”继由晋察冀边区参议会副议长于力先生发言：“召开华北临时人民代表大会以产生华北政府是适合民主原则的，因这两大解放区自日本投降后，地区更为扩大，较之抗战期间扩大两倍，而两边区参议会则均在抗战期间产生，代表现在华北解放区四千五百万人口，甚感不够。同时，多年来参议员人事变动亦很大。故以召开临时人民代表大会为宜。临时代表大会的筹备工作，我提议应由已经联合办公的两边区政府办理。”刘参议员俊德发言：“为了集合华北人民的力量，更有力的支援前线，以争取人民解放战争的胜利，两个政府合并很必要；召开临时代表大会产生华北联合政府的办法也是好的。”郭参议员栋臣说：“人民是早就希望统一的。在抗战时期，分开是不得已的。现在为了便商利民，交流物资，我完全同意大家的意见。”安参议员宅仁说：“解放区的民主实质从来就有，但民主形式在抗战初期，是很简陋的，到参议会的选举，就已经比较完备多了。这次决定召开临时人民代表大会，民主形式就更加完备。我认为建设一个新的国家，这是必要的，不可或缺的。”年高须白的阎参议员力宣说：“两区合并很重要。共产党提议召开政治协商会议，成立全国民主联合政府，我们就首先响应。”王参议员乃堂说：“同意邢、于两先生意见。两区政府的统一，不只今天，才有这个要求；抗日时期即有此需要。如货币不统一、邮政不统一、物资不能交流，人民早已感受不便。不过，现在这个要求更加迫切了。”晁副议长哲甫说：“两区合并，建立统一的政府，合乎人民需要；召开临时代表大会，比召开两区参议会的民主形式更完备些。”杨参议员耕田说：“临时代表大会召开时，两区政府应向大会作报告。”裴参议员毓明说：“同意大家意见。临时代表大会应迅速筹备召开；筹备工作按法定手续应由政府负责。”会议经过三小时的热烈讨论，大家意见完全一致。最后薄议长一波起立发言，他说：“今天全体参议员先生一致同意中共华北中央局的建议，我谨代表中共华北中央局向大家致谢。”接着又说：“两解放区合并为华北解放区，两边区政府合并为华北政府，是为人民生活所必须，且为客观情况所完全许可。过去分割是被迫的，不得已的，今天再把这种人为的分割继续下去，已没有任何根据。”他继说：“华北临时人民代表大会应该在极其广泛的反蒋民族统一战线的基础上召开，应该代表并团结全华北的工人、农民、独立劳动者、知识分子、自由资产阶级、开明绅士、少数民族及一切反美帝反蒋民主力量，以产生华北的民主联合政府。”在他详细地阐明了华北临时人民代表大会及将来产生的华北民主联合政府的任务、性质和共产党的愿望后，接着又对两区参议会过去的工作，作了很高的评价。他说：“在抗战期间，共产党所提出的十大政策，晋察冀与晋冀鲁豫两解放区参议会均先后予以通过采纳，如晋察冀一九四○年颁布双十纲领，晋冀鲁豫一九四一年颁布边区施政纲领，以及各项政策法令，如减租减息、精兵简政、发展生产、团结各阶层人民抗战等等，都是集中了广大人民的意见，为我党所提出，为参议会所通过所采纳，成为两解放区坚持抗战，打败日本的依据，也是打败蒋军进攻，取得不断胜利的依据。两解放区人民是光荣的，两解放区参议会也是光荣的。”薄议长最后着重说明：“十一年来我党一条不变的方针，就是紧密团结各阶层人民共同击败人民的敌人，建议新民主主义新中国的总政策。今后仍然要贯彻这一条总政策，组织华北四千五百万人民的力量，执行我党中央和人民领袖毛泽东的号召，把工业农业生产提高一寸，以便更有力地为解放全华北以至全中国而奋斗。”薄议长发言后，全场均极兴奋。最后由主席成议长归纳讨论结果为两项决议，提请大家表决：（一）同意两解放区合并为华北解放区，两边区政府合并为华北政府。现在业已联合办公的两边区政府为过渡到完全统一的华北政府的过渡政府形式。（二）由业经联合办公的两边区政府立即筹备，并迅速召开华北临时人民代表大会，以便产生华北的统一的民主联合政府。当经全体驻会参议员一致通过。会议历时三小时于团结、和谐、愉快的空气中闭幕。"

    "title": "The Truth About US Imperialism Supporting Japan",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-12",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The Truth About US Imperialism Supporting Japan\n　　On July 26, 1945, the United States, Britain, and China issued the Potsdam Declaration to Japan. After the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan, it also signed the declaration. The various clauses concerning Japan's unconditional surrender stipulated in this declaration are the highest principles that the Allied countries should follow in implementing their policies towards Japan. The declaration stipulates:\n　　\"The authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated forever, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice is impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.\n　　………Until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed, Japanese territory, as designated by the Allies, must be occupied to ensure that the basic purposes we state herein are accomplished.\n　　………Japanese troops, after complete disarmament, will be allowed to return to their homes and have the opportunity for a peaceful and productive life.\n　　………War criminals shall be brought to justice. The Japanese government must remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, religion and thought, and respect for fundamental human rights must be established.\n　　Japan will be allowed to maintain the industries necessary for its economy and to pay reparations in kind, but not those industries that can rearm it for war.\"\n　　In simple terms, these principles are: war criminals must be severely punished; aggressive forces and militarism must be permanently eliminated; the Japanese government must implement democratic reforms; the Japanese people must obtain democratic freedoms; Japan will only be allowed to maintain industries necessary for its economy and to pay reparations; war industries and war-making capabilities must be destroyed; armaments must be completely dismantled; and the purpose of the Allied occupation of Japan is to achieve the above principles.\n　　In December 1945, the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the consent of the Chinese government, decided to establish the Far Eastern Commission (composed of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, China, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, India, the Philippines, and New Zealand) as the decision-making body for implementing the Potsdam terms, with the power to review the instructions and measures of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces occupying Japan; at the same time, it was decided to establish the Allied Council for Japan (composed of representatives from the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, as well as joint representatives from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and India), stipulating that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces must consult and confer with the Council before issuing orders on major matters. This council is commonly known as the Allied Control Council.\n　　MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, was stationed in Japan, and his mission was to thoroughly implement the Potsdam terms; all his control measures over Japan should be subject to the constraints of the Far Eastern Commission; and he was subject to a certain degree of constraint by the Allied Control Council on issues of \"fundamental reorganization of the Japanese constitutional structure\" or \"overall reorganization of the Japanese government.\" (According to the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference resolution, on the above issues, if \"one member of the Allied Control Council disagrees with the Supreme Commander, the Supreme Commander should temporarily suspend the issuance of orders on such issues until the Far Eastern Commission has reached an agreement on the matter.\")\n　　However, the actions of the US government and MacArthur in Japan for nearly three years have completely contradicted the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, and disregarded the power of the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Control Council, ignoring their numerous protests, consistently taking unilateral actions, and implementing a policy of supporting the revival of Japanese militarist aggressive forces.\n　　Let us see what the US government and MacArthur have done in Japan.\n　　　　I. Sheltering War Criminals and Releasing War Criminals\n　　Delaying the Judgment of War Criminals\n　　Regarding the trial of Japanese fascist leaders such as Tojo and twenty-four other war criminals, the US occupation authorities not only allowed these war criminals to use the court as a platform to promote the fascist theory that Japan's war of aggression \"was for self-defense,\" but also specially hired American lawyers to shamelessly defend the war criminals. The trial work has been going on for more than two years, and the final judgment has not yet been issued.\n　　Another batch of twenty Class A war criminals who have not been tried, including former Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army, Neiji Okamura, former Commander of the South China Expeditionary Army, Ando Kisaburo, former Commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, Tada Shun, former head of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Intelligence Agency, Kodama Yoshio, and five members of the Tojo Cabinet, were proposed for release by Keenan, the US Chief Prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal, to the US Army Department War Crimes Group at the end of last year. Due to the pressure of international public opinion, the US military occupation authorities have now released news that they will be tried, but their crimes will be minimized as much as possible, and they will be changed from Class A war criminals to Class B and C war criminals. (According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo on June 10)\n　　Many important war criminals were released by US reactionaries. For example, Ikeda Seihin, Gogu Kiyoshi, Furuta Toshiyuki, Fujiwara Ginjiro, the top planners of the Japanese war economy, and Ogura Masatsune, the economic advisor to the puppet Wang Jingwei government, were released shortly after being arrested at the end of 1945. Another batch of Class A war criminals, including Ayukawa Yoshisuke, the military industrial magnate who invaded Northeast China, Nakajima Chikuhei, the aircraft king, Kiso Kobayashi, the former Governor-General of Taiwan and president of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and Masaki Jinzaburo, an extreme fascist, were \"acquitted\" on August 30 last year. The next day, Iinosuke Furuno, president of Domei News Agency, and Raisuke Arima, advisor to the Greater Japan Political Association, were also released.\n　　Purge work, granting leniency on all sides\n　　The so-called \"purge\" work of war criminals is a farce of \"fascists clearing out fascists\" (in the words of American journalist David Arnold). MacArthur's headquarters recently announced that the purge work has been completed. But what is its actual content? The blacklist listed 212,846 people, and after the \"review,\" \"consideration,\" and \"judgment\" of the War Crimes Committee members, only 107 people were deemed \"undemocratic.\" On May 22, MacArthur's headquarters approved the reinstatement of 129 accused war criminals to public office, including Kaname Abeshiro, the chief secretary of the Shidehara Cabinet, Tatsujiro Yunomura, the advisor to the former Oriental Development Corporation (i.e., the joint-stock company) who plundered Chinese resources, Uichiro Yamaike, a former member of the North China Development Corporation, Tsunekichi Ishida, the former assistant manager of the Mengjiang Bank, and Arata Sugihara, the former director-general of the Greater East Asia Ministry and counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing and Shanghai. (According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo)\n　　The main culprits of the invasion of China are still invading China\n　　Okamura Neji, one of the main culprits of the invasion of China and former commander of the China Expeditionary Army, is still serving as an advisor to Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing. In Japan, Japanese war criminals who invaded China, such as Kagesa Teizo, the Japanese secret service chief behind the puppet Wang regime, are also allowed to remain at large by the US military occupation authorities, without arrest or extradition. American imperialists are not only actively sheltering war criminals who invaded China, but also actively using their experience in invading China to serve as accomplices in American aggression against China. In early July of last year, the United States brought two ships of Japanese \"special immigrants\" to Taiwan, including Hasegawa Kiyoshi, the former Governor-General of Taiwan and a Japanese war criminal, Ayukawa Yoshisuke, the former president of the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Corporation, and other Japanese military, political, and cultural personnel. They were hired by American imperialists to build military bases in Taiwan, develop Taiwan's resources, and assist the United States in training Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. In March of this year, MacArthur introduced Horiuchi Kaneki, a Japanese war criminal who invaded China and former minister to the puppet Nanjing government, and Yamada Tadashi, another financial magnate, as advisors to Song Ziwen, the director of the Pacification Headquarters in South China under the Chiang government.\n　　　　II. Supporting Militarism\n　　Preserving the Emperor System\n　　The Japanese Emperor system is a militarist aggressive organization. During the war, the Emperor used methods such as issuing edicts and making radio speeches to encourage the war of aggression. He was the supreme commander of the Japanese army, and he issued the declaration of war against the United States in the Pacific War. He is directly responsible for the war and should be treated as a war criminal. But MacArthur not only did not treat him as a war criminal or destroy his reactionary influence among the Japanese people, but also respectfully called him \"His Majesty,\" maintaining his prestige among the Japanese people. The new Japanese constitution drafted by MacArthur's headquarters stipulates that \"the Emperor, based on the supreme will of the Japanese people, is the symbol of Japan and the unity of the people,\" and that \"the Emperor retains the right of veto over the administrative power of the cabinet.\" These provisions actually preserve the reactionary Emperor system.\n　　Preserving the Monopoly Zaibatsu\n　　MacArthur's abstract instructions for \"democratic reform\" are implemented through the old Japanese reactionary rulers, so it cannot be expected that they will produce truly democratic results. Seven of the nine members of the committee to dissolve the Zaibatsu are either the Zaibatsu themselves or their henchmen. Under their direction, the Zaibatsu's concerns are only divided into several formally \"independent\" companies, which have no impact on their actual monopoly power. In November of last year, the Japanese Diet formally passed the \"Law on the Exclusion of Economic Power Concentration,\" but in January of this year, the Ashida Cabinet, with MacArthur's consent, decided that the banks of the four major Zaibatsu, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda, would not be \"excluded.\" On May 2, Tokyo newspapers published MacArthur's statement that 194 of the 325 companies listed for dissolution would be removed from the list.\n　　Under the protection of the US occupation authorities, the Japanese Zaibatsu who launched the war of aggression not only escaped due punishment, but also bought off political parties, bureaucrats, and politicians, placing their loyal servants and henchmen in the reactionary Japanese Diet and government agencies to protect their interests. In 1946, these Zaibatsu received from the government 45 billion yen in compensation for \"wartime losses\" from military industries, and another 50 billion yen in compensation for losses of overseas assets.\n　　Preserving Fascist Groups\n　　The leaders of many well-known fascist groups in pre-war Japan, such as Nissho Inoue, Kozo Tachibana, Tatsuo Amano, Sakichi Mitsui, and Tamao Hishinuma, are still active after the war. During the first post-war general election in Japan in April 1946, Japanese fascists organized 30 to 40 political parties to openly participate in the election. Such as the Japan National Party of the Yoshio Kodama faction, the National Laborers' Alliance and the Constitutional Youth Party of the Ryoichi Isaka faction, as well as the Autonomous Imperial Subjects Association and the Imperial Subjects Front Council. During the period of the planned general strike by Japanese workers in February 1947, members of the New Speech Mass Party led by Yasutomo Maki openly attacked union offices, beat union leaders, and stabbed Katsumi Kikitani, chairman of Japan's most powerful union, the National Congress of Industrial Organizations. These atrocities have not been punished in any way. At the end of 1947, various reactionary fascist groups in Japan, led by the Save the Nation Righteousness Party, organized the National Anti-Communist Groups Council. According to a survey by the Japanese National Police Agency this spring, there are 250 such \"right-wing groups\" in Tokyo alone, and 1,260 nationwide.\n　　Preserving Landlord Power\n　　In August 1946, MacArthur, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and other Allied countries, unilaterally approved the \"land reform plan\" proposed by the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet. According to this plan, the scale of land ownership can only be reduced, and the ownership of the head of the household is transferred to family ownership, but the feudal land ownership relationship cannot be abolished. But even this reform plan has not been seriously implemented. The so-called \"Agricultural Land Committee\" is actually controlled by the landlords. According to the regulations, 5 million acres of landlord land should have been requisitioned by the end of May last year, but only 900,000 acres were requisitioned by July last year, and all of it fell into the hands of the landlords' relatives. Until this spring, according to a report by the Allied Control Council for Japan, real farmers have not received a single piece of land.\n　　　III. Supporting Reactionary Governments in Suppressing Democratic Movements\n　　Under MacArthur's \"control,\" the old ruling structure—the Emperor system—was not destroyed, the social and economic system that produced militarism—the Zaibatsu's monopoly and feudal land ownership—was not seriously reformed, and the old reactionary ruling group in Japan has always been in power. The Zaibatsu, bureaucrats, and politicians who cooperated with the military during the war, supported the war, or promoted the war, and even the warlords who launched the war and directly commanded the operations, either hid behind the scenes to manipulate politics, or openly engaged in the so-called \"democratic\" political arena after the war.\n　　The Higashikuni Cabinet, which carried out the surrender, was a purely war criminal cabinet. Higashikuni himself was the commander of the army that captured Wuhan in 1938. During the six weeks that this cabinet was in power, it destroyed and modified the archives of the army and navy, covered up war criminals, concealed crimes, hid huge amounts of military supplies (some of which were later sold on the black market), and enabled various fascist militarist groups to change their faces and preserve themselves.\n　　The subsequent four cabinets were all reactionary bureaucratic Zaibatsu cabinets, and none of the cabinet members did not include several war criminal ministers. The Shidehara Cabinet included former Commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, Shimonura Tei, former Commander of the North China Fleet and later Commander of the Combined Fleet, Toyoda Soemu, Secretary-General of the Greater Japan Political Association, Matsumura Kenzo, and Kozo Iwata, advisor to the Koiso Cabinet. The Yoshida Cabinet included Tanzan Ishibashi, a member of the Wartime Planning Board and a member of the Ministry of Finance. The Katayama Cabinet included Rikizo Hirano and Suehiro Nishio (the current Deputy Prime Minister of the Ashida Cabinet), social fascists who deceived Japanese workers and peasants, calling on them to actively produce and support the war. Ashida himself, the current Prime Minister, was the president of the English-language \"Japan Times,\" which published 84 special issues, enthusiastically praising the \"Anti-Comintern Pact\" and promoting friendship with fascist Germany and Italy, as well as Japan's \"new order\" in Northeast China.\n　　Under such reactionary rule, the Japanese people's democratic movement, which is developing increasingly after the war, has naturally suffered severe oppression. The US military occupation authorities have not only not alleviated this oppression, but have also condoned and encouraged the anti-democratic measures of the Japanese reactionary government, and even directly participated in the suppression of the Japanese people and democratic forces. MacArthur approved the Japanese government to organize secret police to infiltrate trade union organizations to carry out sabotage work in July of the year before last. Demonstrations by Japanese workers or the masses of the people are often interfered with by American military police and troops. MacArthur issued three decrees banning strikes. The first was on May 20 of the year before last, banning the anti-hunger demonstration in Tokyo; the second was on January 31 of last year, banning the general strike of six million people nationwide on February 1; and the third was in March of this year, banning various forms of regional strikes in addition to the general strike. The US Draper economic delegation, which came to Japan in March of this year, even wanted the Ashida government to imitate the US \"Taft-Hartley Act,\" formulate anti-labor laws, ban all strikes, and deprive workers of the right to join unions.\n　　Regarding the only party that firmly opposed the Japanese war of aggression during the war—the Japanese Communist Party—MacArthur has condoned the Japanese government in taking various measures of exclusion and restriction, such as expelling JCP members from government agencies. The JCP's \"Red Flag\" newspaper is often deliberately harassed and restricted by the US military headquarters' censorship personnel. The US military headquarters often spreads rumors and slanders against the JCP, such as propaganda that the JCP wants to \"confiscate property by violence.\" This is just one example of spreading rumors.\n　　The Potsdam Declaration stipulates that obstacles to the development of democratic trends among the Japanese people must be removed. Then, the first thing to do is to remove MacArthur's control over Japan.\n　　　　IV. Canceling the Reparations Plan\n　　Regarding Japan's reparations, the United States has put forward many plans, trying its best to reduce them. The Pauley Plan, published in November of the year before last, allowed Japanese industry to retain the level of 1930-34, stipulating that Japan could produce 2.5 million tons of steel per year; maintain 1.5 million tons of ships, and build 150,000 tons of new ships and repair 3 million tons per year; retain 2,188,000 spindles and 133,000 looms, and may add 3 million spindles and 150,000 looms in the future. Although the Pauley Plan was excessively lenient, it still advocated the demolition of 4,236,600,000 yen (1939 value) of industrial equipment as compensation.\n　　The Far Eastern Commission passed a resolution based on the Pauley Plan, specifically pointing out which types of factories should be demolished as compensation and which types of factories could be retained. According to this resolution, MacArthur's headquarters designated 1,090 factories as compensation in August of the year before last. But in December of the year before last, these factories that should have been used as compensation were removed by MacArthur, leaving only 934. The factories that were removed included 113 aircraft factories.\n　　Last year, MacArthur put forward a compromise plan, reducing Pauley's compensation amount to 2,466,600,000 yen, which is almost a 40% reduction. As a result, 500 factories were removed from the compensation list, including 24 underground aircraft factories. At the beginning of this year, MacArthur cancelled another 83 factories, followed by another 125 factories shortly after.\n　　The Strike Plan, announced in March of this year, further reduced the compensation amount stipulated in MacArthur's compromise plan by 33%. The Draper Plan, announced on May 19, further reduced the compensation to 662,200,000 yen, a 59% reduction compared to the Strike Plan and an 85% reduction compared to the Pauley Plan. This plan also proposed that Japan's overseas assets looted in China and Taiwan should also be used as compensation and offset from the compensation amount of the countries from which they were obtained. In this way, it is equivalent to completely canceling the compensation plan. George Kennan, chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Committee, openly advocated that the United States take unilateral action to stop future compensation. (United Press International, Washington, April 3)\n　　Therefore, the \"temporary compensation\" work decided by MacArthur in April of last year was stopped. At that time, it was stipulated that 30% of the factories on the compensation list would be distributed to China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines first. Due to the deliberate delay of MacArthur's headquarters, the total equipment delivered as the first batch of compensation is still only 80,000 to 100,000 tons. But the United States itself secretly shipped away a large amount of gold, platinum, silver, and precious works of art, hundreds of thousands of tons of rubber, tin, and other materials, as well as hundreds of thousands of tons of raw silk and technical equipment that Japan looted from Eastern countries during the war.\n　　　　V. Restoring Economic Aggression\n　　The \"East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" is revived\n　　The Japanese government's \"Five-Year Economic Reconstruction Plan\" (published on May 17), drafted according to Draper's principles, plans to increase exports to US$1,646,600,000 by 1952, which is nine times the current export amount, or about three and a half times the export amount in 1937 (the year of the July 7th Incident).\n　　Regarding the number of spindles, the Japanese government requested the Draper delegation to restore it to 8 million spindles, but it is rumored that the US government is preparing to restore it to 10 million spindles, which is the level before the \"July 7th\" war.\n　　How much difference is there between this number of 8 million spindles or 10 million spindles and the number of spindles necessary for the lives of the Japanese people? According to the principle of the Allied countries controlling Germany, the living standard of the German people cannot exceed the general living standard of the people in European countries (excluding Britain and the Soviet Union), then the living standard of the Japanese people after the war cannot exceed the living standard of the people in various Far Eastern countries. Among the Far Eastern countries, India has the most developed textile industry, with an average of one spindle for every 33 people. Taking India as an example, the recent population of Japan is 78 million (official statistics), so there can only be 2.4 million spindles. Calculated on the basis of an average consumption of 9.5 yards of cotton per person per year, then the 741 million yards of cloth required by Japan for the whole year (approximately equivalent to Japan's total consumption in 1935) only requires 1.06 million spindles. If there are 1.5 million spindles, there will be enough cotton textiles to export in exchange for the cotton it needs.\n　　As for the food problem of the Japanese people, according to Paul, the Australian representative of the Allied Control Council for Japan, in his \"Impressions of Japan\" published in the March issue of \"Pacific\" magazine, Japanese farmers are now minimizing their reported harvests in order to avoid paying taxes; and the Japanese government is also underestimating domestic production in order to obtain large amounts of imports. His conclusion is: the Japanese government's food production figures are not credible. \"The solution to the Japanese food problem depends on the government and party organizations. In 1946, Japan's domestic food production was quite sufficient, and if it could be properly concentrated and evenly distributed, then famine could be avoided.\" (June 8, Tianjin Dagong Bao) This passage tells us that making the Japanese people free from hunger is not a matter of expanding exports, but a matter of government organization, in other words, a matter of the democratization of the Japanese government.\n　　The purpose of the United States in restoring Japan's export industry is to make Japan its \"Asian factory.\" Jacob, chairman of the American Textile Manufacturers Association, who led the Japanese textile industry survey team, declared after \"inspecting\" Japan in March of this year: \"The United States will help Japan revive its economy and textile industry, and restore its pre-war Asian market and colonial market, no matter what obstacles other Asian countries may create, the United States is determined to do so.\" One of his entourage even bluntly said: \"American raw cotton, capital, and management, Japanese labor, and the Chinese market will be merged into an excellent plan.\"\n　　In order to realize this plan, the United States is preparing to lend Japan 765 million US dollars this year, of which 60 million is a US cotton loan, which has been approved by MacArthur on June 8. With the assistance of MacArthur's headquarters, the Japanese government is preparing to export 100,000 tons of copper products to various Far Eastern countries this year, and more than 4 million yards of clothing made of American cotton will also be exported by Japan, flooding the markets of China and Southeast Asia.\n　　In order to transport and sell Japanese goods, in addition to allowing Japan to retain 4 million tons of ships and build 400,000 tons of new ships per year, the Draper delegation also allowed the Japanese Minister of Transportation, Okada Seichi, to meet his demands as much as possible, that is, to lease 30 remaining 10,000-ton Liberty ships to Japan.\n　　Making Japan an appendage of the United States under the slogan of \"self-sufficiency\"\n　　The excuse for the United States to help Japan restore its economic aggression is to make the Japanese economy \"self-sufficient.\" So, let's take a look at Japan's foreign trade in the past two years.\n　　According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, in Japan's trade last year, the United States accounted for 86% of imports, and the percentage of exports to other countries was 66.8% to East Asian countries and 16.9% to the United States. In the previous year, the United States accounted for 60% of Japan's exports and 100% of imports from the United States. The Japanese market is wide open to the United States, while the US market is closed to Japan. The United States wants to monopolize the Japanese market and contract Japan's imports, for example, in the case of cotton, it is stipulated that 60% of American cotton must be purchased. The United States inputs capital, technology, and some raw materials into Japan, and after manufacturing by cheap Japanese labor, Japan then exports to various East Asian countries.\n　　Another excuse for the United States to help Japan is to save the Japanese people from hunger. But according to the Tokyo correspondent of the American \"Christian Science Monitor,\" \"the lives and labor of most Japanese workers after the surrender are simply the same as 200 years ago.\" The reporter pointed out that, as before, Japanese factories and workshops widely used female workers and child laborers. For example, more than 60,000 of the 75,000 workers in the \"Kanebo\" yarn factory in Osaka are female workers and children aged 12 to 16. Although they work 12 hours like adult male workers, their wages are only 25% to 50% of those of male workers. The feudal contracting system still exists. For example, nearly 140,000 day laborers in Kanagawa Prefecture are still controlled by Matsui, a munitions contractor. More than half of the workers' wages fall into the pockets of the contractor and his accomplices under the name of \"commission.\" If Japan does not have political democracy, the lives of the Japanese people will never be improved. American imperialism, on the one hand, is reviving Japan's fascist forces, and on the other hand, is aiding Japan, obviously not to improve the lives of the Japanese people, but to cultivate Japanese fascist forces.\n　　　　VI. Preserving Military Industry\n　　The Japanese ships and shipbuilding capabilities that the United States wants to preserve have been mentioned above. As for steelmaking capacity, the Draper Plan allows for 8.5 million tons (the number approved by the Far Eastern Commission is 3.5 million tons), which is 500,000 tons more than Japan's peak wartime production capacity. The levels of other industries, since the full text of the Draper Plan has not been seen, can only be listed according to the Strike Plan, which was published in late February and is more \"strict\" than the Draper Plan:\n　　Thermal power generation:　　　　　　Entirely retained　600,000 kilowatts (according to \"World Knowledge\" on April 10)\n　　Thermal power generation:　　　　　　Entirely retained　220,000 kilowatts\n　　Aluminum production:　　　　　　　Retain half　43,000 metric tons\n　　Aluminum rolling:　　　　　　　Entirely retained　48,000 metric tons\n　　Copper refining:　　　　　　　Entirely retained　70,000 metric tons\n　　Copper fabrication:　　　　　　　Entirely retained　135,000 metric tons\n　　Machine tool manufacturing (including aircraft factories and armories):\n　　　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　(approximately 750,000 machine tools)\n　　Bearings:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained\n　　Sulfuric acid:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　4,756,000 metric tons\n　　Nitric acid:　　　　　　　　Retain 20%　30,000 metric tons\n　　Soda ash:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　493,000 metric tons\n　　Caustic soda (electrolytic):　　　　Entirely retained　129,000 metric tons\n　　Synthetic oil:　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 110,000 kiloliters\n　　Alcohol:　　　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 210,000 kiloliters\n　　Petroleum refining:　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 1,630,000 kiloliters\n　　Oil storage facilities:　　　　　　Entirely retained　approximately 1,210,000 kiloliters\n　　(The above is translated from the Japanese \"Diamond\" magazine published in the May 1st issue of \"Time and Tide\")\n　　After the Strike Plan was submitted, the US government, through General Eichelberger, commander of the US Eighth Army and commander of ground forces stationed in Japan, secretly notified companies with direct interests that 125 factories originally listed on the compensation list (including 20 joint manufacturing plants of the steel industry company that manufactured tanks during the war and 45 other enterprises, including a large-scale aircraft manufacturing plant formerly belonging to the Nakajima Zaibatsu) had been exempted from dismantling for compensation by MacArthur and ordered them to formulate technical plans for renovation based on standards that exceeded wartime production by two times. The financial assistance and technical guidance required for the renovation will be provided and supervised by the United States.\n　　　　VII. Rearming Japan\n　　The Secrets of the \"Pioneer Corps\"\n　　With the tacit approval of MacArthur's headquarters, thousands of former Japanese army, navy, and air force officers took off their uniforms and mixed into the Repatriation Bureau to smoothly disguise a large number of military cadres as \"Pioneer Corps,\" \"Fishermen's Associations,\" or \"Cooperative Farms.\" The American \"Baltimore Sun\" revealed the fact that an artillery school had become a \"cooperative farm.\" The farm is located in Chiba Prefecture and covers 6,000 acres. The farm staff includes three generals, 17 colonels, 12 lieutenant colonels, 39 majors, 48 captains, 15 commanders, 107 non-commissioned officers, and 231 soldiers. These military organizations under the banners of \"farms,\" \"pioneer corps,\" etc., are obtaining weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food from the so-called \"US surplus military supplies\" and storing them. At the same time, they are also accumulating funds, waiting for the opportunity to restore the army. Repatriated soldiers have been thoroughly investigated and registered by the Japanese police, and a team can be formed immediately with a simple summons.\n　　Expanding the Police Force and Establishing an Army\n　　The Japanese police force, which numbered only 65,000 before the war, has been expanded several times. The Japanese government has now admitted that it has 125,000 people. But in fact, it is rumored that there are 300,000 (according to the declaration of 291 celebrities from all walks of life in China and the declaration of 437 professors in Peiping this June). According to Volume 17, Issue 12 of World Knowledge, most of the current police are demobilized soldiers. The highest agency commanding the police, the so-called \"National Security Committee\" directly under the Prime Minister, is actually a disguised Ministry of the Army. The \"police districts\" in various places are disguised \"military districts.\" The Police University, established on May 1 this year, is a disguised officers' school or army university.\n　　According to a telegram from our agency in Shandong on June 29, a certain expert who recently returned from Japan to our liberated area said that MacArthur recently established an organization in Japan similar to the military department in the past, abbreviated as \"ZEB,\" under the pretext of organizing the police, but secretly assumes the task of recruiting, training, and arming the Japanese army. The Japanese who enlist in the army under the name of police are required to serve for five years and are trained in units of battalions, with 700 to 900 people per battalion. It is expected that 300 battalions will be completed by the end of 1949. In the future, five Japanese battalions and one American battalion will be formed into an \"American-Japanese mixed brigade,\" which will be equipped with artillery, tanks, and other special forces staffed exclusively by American troops.\n　　Rebuilding the Navy Under the Pretext of Combating Smuggling\n　　On the naval front, MacArthur, under the pretext of preventing\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝扶日真相\n\n1948-07-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝扶日真相\n    一九四五年七月二十六日美英中三国向日本发出了波茨顿宣言。苏联参加对日作战后，也在这个宣言上签了字。这个宣言上面所规定的关于日本无条件投降的各项条款，是盟国实施对日政策所应遵循的最高原则。宣言中规定：\n    “欺骗及错误领导日本人民，使其妄欲征服世界者之权威及势力，必须永久铲除，因此我们坚持非将负责的军国主义驱出世界，则和平安全及正义的新秩序势不可能。\n    ………直至日本制造战争的力量业已毁灭有确实可信的证据时，日本领土，经盟国之指定，必须占领，俾我们在这里陈述的基本目的得以完成。\n    ………日本军队在完全解除武装以后，将被允许返其家乡，得有和平及生产生活的机会。\n    ………对于战罪人犯，将处以法律的裁判。日本政府必须将阻止日本人民民主趋势的复兴及增强之所有障碍，予以消除。言论、宗教及思想自由以及对于基本人权的重视必须成立。\n    日本将被允许维持其经济所必需及可以偿付货物赔款的工业，但可以使其重新武装作战的工业不在其内。”\n    这些原则，说得简单些，便是：战犯必须严惩；侵略势力和军国主义，必须永久铲除；日本政府必须实行民主改革；日本人民必须获得民主自由；日本仅允许维持其经济及偿付赔款所必须的工业；战争工业与制造战争的力量必须摧毁；军备武装必须彻底解除；而盟国占领日本的目的，也就是要实现上述许多原则。\n    一九四五年十二月莫斯科英美苏三国外长会议，经中国政府同意，决定设立远东委员会（由苏、英、美、中、法、荷、澳、加、印、菲、新西兰参加），为执行波茨顿条款之决策机关，并有权考核占领日本之盟军统帅之指令及各种措施；同时，并决定成立盟国对日委员会（由美、苏、中三国代表及英、澳、新西兰、印度之联合代表参加），规定盟军统帅在颁发重大事项之命令前，须先与该委员会商讨及咨询。该会通称盟国管制委员会。\n    麦克阿瑟以盟军最高统帅的身份进驻日本，他的任务，就是彻底实现波茨顿条款；他的对日管制的一切措施应受远东委员会的约束；在“日本宪政结构之基本改组”或“日本政府整个改组”问题上，并受盟国管制委员会一定程度的约束。（据莫斯科三外长会议决议，在上述问题上，如盟国对日管制委员会“委员一人与最高统帅表示异议，最高统帅在远东委员会关于此事未有协议前，应暂绥颁发关于此等问题之命令。”）\n    可是，美国政府与麦克阿瑟在日本将近三年的作为，完全与波茨顿宣言的精神背道而驰，并且无视远东委员会与盟国对日管制委员会的权力，无视它们的多次抗议，一贯采取片面行动，实行了扶植日本军国主义侵略势力复兴的政策。\n    我们且看美国政府与麦克阿瑟在日本干了些什么。\n    　　　　一、庇护战争罪犯释放战争罪犯\n    拖延战犯的判决\n    对于日本法西斯头子东条等二十五名战犯的审判，美国占领当局不仅听任这些战犯以法庭为讲坛，宣传日本侵略战争“系出于自卫”的法西斯理论，而且特地雇用美籍律师，无耻地替战犯们辩护。审判工作进行了两年有余，最后判决还没有下文。\n    其他未予审讯的另外一批二十名一级战犯，包括前中国派遣军总司令西尾寿造、前华南派遣军司令安藤纪三郎、前华北派遣军司令多田骏、前上海日海军特务机关长儿玉誉志夫及东条内阁阁员五名在内，去年底曾由远东国际军事法庭美国首席检查官季南向美陆军部战犯组提议释放。由于国际舆论的压力，现美军占领当局又放出要审讯他们的消息，但他们的罪行将尽量缩小，由一级战犯变成二级三级战犯。（据中央社东京六月十日专电）\n    许多重要战犯被美反动派开释。如组织日本战争经济的最高策划者池田成彬、乡古洁、古田俊之助、藤原银次郎以及伪汪精卫政府的经济顾问小仓正恒，一九四五年末拘捕后不久即行释放。而另一批一级战犯，包括侵我东北的军需财阀鲇川义介、飞机大王中岛知久平、前台湾总督和翼赞政治会总裁小林跻造、极端法西斯分子真崎甚三郎等二十三名，竟于去年八月三十日“无罪”释放。次日，同盟社社长古野伊之助和大日本政治会顾问有马赖宁二人也被开释。\n    清洗工作，网开三面\n    对于战犯的所谓“整肃”工作，是“叫法西斯分子去清除法西斯分子”（美记者大卫·阿诺德语）的滑稽剧。麦克阿瑟总部最近宣布清洗工作已经完成。但其实际内容如何呢？黑名单上开列了廿一万二千八百四十六人，经过战犯委员们的“审查”、“考虑”、“判断”的结果，只剩下一百零七名是“不民主”的了。五月二十二日麦克阿瑟总部即批准了一百二十九名被检举的战犯恢复公职，其中包括币原内阁的书记官长＠桥渡和掠夺中国资源的前东方开发株式会社（即股份公司）顾问汤村达次郎、前华北开发株式会社要员山池卯一郎、前伪蒙疆银行襄理石田恒吉、前大东亚省总务司长兼日驻京沪大使馆参赞杉原荒太等人在内。（据中央社东京专电）\n    侵华罪魁，仍在侵华\n    侵华罪魁之一前中国派遣军司令网村宁次，仍在南京当蒋介石的顾问。在日本本国侵华战犯，如汪伪政府幕后的日本特务头子影佐桢昭等人，美军占领当局亦任其逍遥法外，不加逮捕和引渡。美国帝国主义者不仅积极地庇护侵华战犯，而且还积极地利用他们侵华的经验，充当美国侵华的帮手。去年七月初，美国便替台湾招来了两船日本“特别移民”，其中包括日战犯前台湾总督长谷川清和前满洲重工业会社总裁鲇川义介与其他日本军政文化人员。他们被美国帝国主义者聘请前来建造台湾的军事基地，开发台湾的资源，并协助美国来训练蒋匪军队。今年三月，麦克阿瑟又介绍日本侵华要犯、前驻伪宁公使堀内干城及另一名财阀要员山田忠充当蒋政府华南绥靖主任宋子文的顾问。\n    　　　　二、扶植军国主义\n    保存天皇制度\n    日本的天皇制，就是军国主义的侵略机构。天皇在战争期间，用发布诏书、作广播演说等方法，作过许多鼓励侵略战争的活动。他是日本军队的最高统帅，太平洋战争对美国的宣战诏书就是他颁布的，他对战争负有直接责任。应该作为战犯处理。但麦克阿瑟不仅没有把他当作战犯，摧毁他在日本人民中的反动影响，而且还尊称他作“陛下”，保持他在日本人民中的威信。麦克阿瑟总部，草拟的日本新宪法，规定“天皇根据日本国民之最高总意，为日本及国民统一之象征”，“天皇对内阁的行政大权，保留否决之权”。这些规定，实际上保存了反动的天皇制。\n    保存独占财阀\n    麦克阿瑟的“民主改革”的抽象指令，是通过旧日本的反动统治者去执行的，这就不能期待他们作出真正民主化的结果。解散财阀委员会中的九个委员，其中七个就是财阀自己或财阀的爪牙。在他们主持之下，财阀们的康采仑，仅分散为若干形式上“独立”经营的公司，对其实际的独占权，并无影响。去年十一月日议会形式上通过了“经济力集中排除法”，但今年一月芦田内阁又经麦克阿瑟的同意，决定三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀的银行不在“排除”之列，五月二日东京报纸发表了麦克阿瑟的声明，将列入分散名单中之三百二十五家公司，勾消了一百九十四家。\n    在美国占领当局的庇护之下，发动侵略战争的日本财阀，不仅逃避了应有的惩罚，而且收买政党、官僚、政客，在反动的日本议会和政府机构中，布置了他们的忠仆和爪牙，保护着他们的利益。在一九四六年，这些财阀就由政府得到了对于军需工业的四百五十亿日圆“战时损失”的补偿费，和另一个对于国外资产损失的五百余亿日圆的补偿费。\n    保存法西斯团体\n    日本战前许多有名的法西斯团体领导人，如井上日召、橘孝三郎、天野辰夫、满井佐吉、菱沼玉郎等，战后依然在活动。一九四六年四月日本战后第一次大选时，日本法西斯分子组织了卅至四十个政党公开参加竞选。如儿玉誉志夫系的日本国民党、＠川良一系的全国勤劳者同盟和立宪青年党、以及自治皇民会、皇民战线协议会。天皇制奉护同盟等便是。一九四七年二月日本工人准备大罢工的期间，真木康年领导下的新说大众党党员公开袭击工会办公处，殴打工会领袖，并刺伤日本最强大的工会——全国产业别劳动组合协议会——主席听涛克已。这些暴行，并未受到任何惩罚。一九四七年底，日本各反动法西斯团体，由救国立正党领导，组织了全国反共团体协议会。据今春日本警察厅的调查，这种“右翼团体”，仅在东京一地即有二百五十个，在全国则有一千二百六十个。\n    保存地主势力\n    一九四六年八月，麦克阿瑟不顾苏联和其他盟国的反对，擅自批准了反动的吉田内阁所提出的“土地改革方案”。根据这一方案，只能缩小土地所有的规模，由家长所有转为家族所有，并不能取消封建的土地所有关系。但即使这种改革方案，仍未被认真执行。所谓“农地委员会”，其实权仍操纵于地主之手。按规定至去年五月底应征购之地主土地为五百万英亩，但到去年七月仅征购九十万英亩，且全部落入地主亲属之手。直至今年春天，据盟国对日管制委员会的报告，真正的农民还没有得到一块土地。\n    　　　三、支持反动政府镇压民主运动\n    在麦克阿瑟的“管制”之下，旧的统治机构——天皇制——没有摧毁，产生军国主义的社会经济制度——财阀的垄断与封建的土地所有——没有认真的改革，日本旧有的反动统治集团仍然一直掌握着政权。就是战时与军部合作、支持战争或鼓吹战争的财阀、官僚、政客，甚至发动战争和直接指挥作战的军阀或则藏于幕后操纵政治，或则公然活动于战后所谓“民主”的政治舞台。\n    执行投降的东久迩内阁，是一个纯粹的由战犯组成的内阁，东久迩自己便是一九三八年指挥日军攻陷我武汉的军团长。这个内阁当政的六个星期之内，消灭了和修改了陆海军的档案，掩护了战犯，隐蔽了罪行，藏匿了巨量军火物资（后来有一部分在黑市抛售），并使各种法西斯军国主义集体改头换面，保存下来。\n    其后的四届内阁，都是反动的官僚财阀内阁，内阁人员中，没有一届不包含若干战犯大臣。币原内阁中有前华北派遣军司令下村定、前华北舰队司令及其后的联合舰队司令丰田副武、大日本政治会干事长松村谦三、小矶内阁顾问岩田宙造等。吉田内阁中有战时企划院委员及大藏省委员石桥湛三等。片山内阁中有欺骗日本工农，叫他们积极生产支持战争的社会法西斯分子平野力三和西尾末广（现芦田内阁副首相）等。现内阁首相芦田本人，曾是英文“日本时报”社社长，出版过八十四种特辑，热烈赞扬“反共协定”，宣传对法西斯德国和意大利的亲善，以及日本在我东北的“新秩序”。\n    在这样的反动统治之下，战后日益发展的日本人民民主运动，自然遭受到严重的压迫。美军占领当局不仅没有减轻这种压迫，而且纵容鼓励日本反动政府的反民主措施，甚至自己也直接参加了对日本人民与民主力量的镇压。麦克阿瑟前年七月曾经批准日政府组织秘密警察打入工会组织中去作破坏工作。日本工人或人民群众的示威，常常受到美国宪兵和军队的干涉。麦克阿瑟颁布过三次禁止罢工的法令，第一次是前年五月二十日，禁止东京的反饥饿示威；第二次是去年一月三十一日，禁止二月一日全国六百万人的总罢工；第三次是今年三月，除总罢工外，又禁止各种形式的地域性罢工。今年三月间到日本的美国德莱柏经济代表团，甚至要芦田政府做效美国的“塔夫脱——哈特莱法案”，制订反劳工法，取缔一切罢工，剥夺工人参加工会的权利。\n    对于在战时唯一坚决反对日本侵略战争的政党——日本共产党，麦克阿瑟纵容日本政府采取各种排斥和限制的措施，如自政府机关中开除日共党员等。日共“红旗报”经常受到美军总部新闻检查人员的故意刁难和限制。美军总部时常造谣诬蔑日共，如宣传日共要以“暴力没收财产”。就是造谣之一例。\n    波茨顿宣言规定，日本人民民主趋势发展的障碍，必须清除。那么，首先就应当清除麦克阿瑟的对日管制。\n    　　　　四、取消赔偿计划\n    关于日本的赔偿，美国提出过好些方案，竭力设法把它减少。前年十一月发表的鲍莱计划，允许日本工业可保留一九三○——三四年的水准，规定日本每年可生产钢铁二百五十万吨；保有船舶一百五十万吨，每年可造新船十五万吨，修理三百万吨；保存现有纱锭二百十八万八千枚，织机十三万三千架，将来可能再增加纱锭三百万枚，织机十五万架，虽然鲍莱此案已过分宽大，但毕竟还主张拆迁四十二亿三千六百万日圆（一九三九年的价值）的工业设备，充作赔偿。\n    远东委员会根据鲍莱计划通过了一个决议，具体指出那些种类的工厂应该拆毁，充作赔偿，那些种类的工厂才能保留。根据这个决议，前年八月麦克阿瑟总部指定了一千另九十座工厂充作赔偿。可是到了前年十二月，这些应当充作赔偿的工厂就被麦克阿瑟删掉了一批，只剩下九百三十四所。被删去的工厂中包括一百十三所飞机工厂。\n    去年麦克阿瑟又提出了折衷的方案，将鲍莱的赔偿额削减至二十四亿六千六百万日圆，即几乎削减了百分之四十。于是，赔偿名单中又被删掉了五百家工厂，其中包括二十四所地下飞机工厂。今年初，麦克阿瑟再勾消了八十三家工厂，接着不久又勾掉了一百二十五家工厂。\n    今年三月公布的斯揣克计划，又将麦克阿瑟的折衷方案所规定的赔偿额再减低了百分之三十三。而五月十九日发表的德莱柏计划，则又把赔偿削减为六亿六千二百万日圆，比斯揣克计划减少百分之五十九，比鲍莱计划减少百分之八十五。这个计划并且提出日本前在中国、台湾所掠夺的国外资产，亦应充作赔偿品，并自所得国家之赔偿额中抵消。这样一来，就等于完全取消了赔偿计划。美国国务院政策设计委员会主席凯南，就公开主张美国采取片面行动，停止今后的赔偿。（合众社华盛顿四月三日电）\n    因此，去年四月麦克阿瑟所决定的“临时赔偿”工作，便告停止。当时规定从列入赔偿名单的工厂中提出百分之卅，先行分配与中、英、荷、菲四国。这个工作由于麦克阿瑟总部的故意拖延，迄今已交付第一批作赔偿品的设备，总共还不过八万吨到十万吨。但美国自己却在占领初期私自运走日本战时自东方各国掠夺得来的大量黄金、白金、银子和珍贵的艺术品、数十万吨橡皮、锡和其他物资，以及数十万吨生丝和技术装备。\n    　　　　五、恢复经济侵略\n    “东亚共荣圈”借尸还魂\n    根据德莱柏的原则所草拟的日本政府“经济复兴五年计划”（五月十七日发表），拟于一九五二年将输出提高到十六亿四千六百万美元，为目前输出额之九倍，亦即约为一九三七年（七七事变的一年）输出额之三倍半。\n    纺锤锭数，日政府曾向德莱柏代表团要求恢复到八百万锭，但近传美国政府准备给它恢复到一千万锭，即“七七”战前之水平。\n    这个八百万锭或一千万锭的数目，和日本人民生活所必需的锭数，相差有多大呢？按照盟国管制德国的原则，德国人民生活水准不能超过欧洲（英、苏除外）国家一般人民生活之上，那么，战后日本人民生活水准亦不能超过远东各国人民生活水准。远东各国，以印度纺织业最发达，平均每三十三人有一个纺锭。如以印度为例，日本人口最近为七千八百万（官方统计），则只能有二百四十万锭。如以每人每年平均消费棉花九码半计算，则日本全年所需之七亿四千一百万码布匹（约相当于日本一九三五年之总消费量），只需一百另六万锭便够了。如果有一百五十万锭，则有足够的棉织品输出，以换回其所需之棉花。\n    至于日本人民的粮食问题，据盟国对日委员会澳洲代表鲍尔在“太平洋”杂志三月号发表的“日本杂感”称，现在日本农民尽量少报收获量，以逃避缴出；而日本政府也尽量低估国内生产量，以获得大量输入。他的结论是：日本政府的粮食生产数字是不可信的。“日本粮食问题的解决，当依政府党政机构而定。一九四六年日本国内粮食的生产相当充足，如能予以适当的集中而作平均的分配，那么，饥荒是可以避免的。”（六月八日津大公报）这段话就告诉我们：使日本人民免于饥饿，不是扩大输出的问题，而是政府机构问题，换句话说，就是日本政府民主化的问题。\n    美国恢复日本输出工业的目的，就在把日本作成其“亚洲工厂”，美国纺织业联合会主席杰可勃领导的日本纺织业调查团，于今年三月间“视察”日本后宣称：“美国协助日本复兴经济及纺织工业，并恢复其战前的亚洲市场及殖民地市场，不论其他亚洲国家将造成何种障碍，美国志在必行。”他的一个随员甚至露骨地说：“美国的原棉、资本及管理，日本的广大劳力，再加上中国的市场，将合并为一极好的计划。”\n    为实现这个计划，美国准备在今年内贷与日本七亿六千五百万美元，其中六千万为美棉贷款，已于六月八日由麦克阿瑟批准，在麦克阿瑟总部援助之下，日本政府本年内准备以十万吨铜制品输往远东各国，而四百余万码由美棉制成的服装，亦将由日本输出，充斥于中国和南洋的市场。\n    为着运销日货，德莱柏代表团除允许日本保有船舶四百万吨并年造新船四十万吨外，并允许尽量满足日运输大臣冈田势一所提的要求。即租予日本剩余的万吨自由轮三十艘。\n    在“自给自足”口号下，使日本成为美国的附庸\n    美国扶助日本恢复经济侵略的借口，是使日本经济“自给自足”。那么，我们且看过去两年日本对外贸易的情况。\n    据日本政府商工省调查，去年日本全年贸易，输入中美国占百分之八十六，输出别国所占百分比，计东亚各国占百分之六十六点八，美国占百分之十六点九。而前年日本输出，美国占百分之六十，输入美国占百分之百。日本市场对美国大开其门，而美国市场却对日关门。美国要独占日本市场，包办日本的输入，例如棉花一项，规定必须购用美棉百分之六十。美国以资本、技术兼以一部原料输入日本，经过日本低廉劳力的制造，由日本再输出东亚各国。\n    美国扶助日本的另一个借口，是为了使日本人民免于饥饿。但据美国“基督教科学箴言报”驻东京记者报导，“投降后多数日本工人的生活与劳动，简直同二百年前一样。”该记者指出，和从前一样，日本的工厂与工场广泛地利用了女工和童工。例如大阪“钟纺”纱厂七万五千工人中有六万以上是女工和十二岁至十六岁未成年的童工。虽然他们和男子成年工人一样工作十二小时，但他们的工资只有男工的百分之二十五到百分之五十。封建性的包工制仍然存在。例如神奈川县近十四万名的日庸工人，照旧由一个军火包工者松井控制着。工人半数以上的工资，在所谓“佣金”的名义下，落入了包工者及其同伙的口袋里。如果日本没有政治的民主，日本人民的生活永远无法改善。美国帝国主义一面复活日本的法西斯势力，一面援助日本，显然不是为了改善日本人民的生活，而是为了培养日本法西斯势力。\n    　　　　六、保存军事工业\n    美国所欲保存的日本船舶和造船能力，上面已经说过。至于炼钢能力，德莱柏计划中所允许的为八百五十万吨（远东委员会通过之数目为三百五十万吨），较日本战时最高生产能力还超过了五十万吨。其他工业水平，因未见德莱柏计划的全文，只能根据二月下旬发表的，比德莱柏计划较为“严格”的斯揣克计划，列举如下：火力发电　　　　　　全部保留　六十万千瓦时（据四月十日\"世界知识\"）火力发电　　　　　　全部保留　二十二万千瓦时铝生产　　　　　　　保留一半　四万三千公吨铝压延　　　　　　　全部保留　四万八千公吨铜精炼　　　　　　　全部保留　七万公吨铜精制　　　　　　　全部保留　十三万五千公吨工作机械制造（包括飞机工厂兵工厂在内）\n　　　　　　　　　　全部保留　（约有工作母机七十五万架）轴承　　　　　　　　全部保留硫酸　　　　　　　　全部保留　四百七十五万六千公吨硝酸　　　　　　　　保留百分之廿　三万公吨灰咸　　　　　　　　全部保留　四十九万三千公吨烧咸（电解）　　　　全部保留　十二万九千公吨人造石油　　　　　　全部保留　约十一万＠（千公升）酒精　　　　　　　　全部保留　约二十一万＠石油精炼　　　　　　全部保留　约一百六十三万＠储油设备　　　　　　全部保留　约一百二十一万＠\n　　（以上据五月一日“时与潮”所载日本“金钢钻”杂志的译文）\n    斯揣克计划书提出之后，美国政府即经由美第八军军长、驻日地面部队总司令艾契柏秘密向有直接利益关系的公司通知：原被列入赔偿名单之一百二十五个工厂（包括战时担任制造坦克的钢铁产业公司的二十个联合制造厂和其他四十五个企业，其中又包括前属×岛财阀的大规模飞机制造厂），已经麦克阿瑟决定免予拆卸作赔偿之用，并令其根据超过战时生产量两倍的标准，拟订改装的技术方案。改装所需要的财政援助与技术指导，都将由美国供给和督率。\n    　　　　七、重新武装日本\n    “开拓团”的秘密\n    在麦克阿瑟总部默许之下，数千名前日本陆、海、空军将校脱下了军装，混入复员局工作，顺利地将大量军事干部用“开拓团”、“渔民协会”、或“合作农场”等伪装掩蔽起来。美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”揭露了一所炮兵学校变成“合作农场”的事实。该农场在千叶县，占地六千英亩。农场职员中计有三名将军、十七名大佐、十二名中佐、卅九名少佐、四十八名大尉、十五名队长、一百零七名下士、二百卅一名士兵。在这些“农场”、“开拓团”等等招牌之下的军事组织，正在从所谓“美国剩余军需物资”中取得武器、弹药、燃料和食品等，并将这些东西储存起来。同时也在积存经费，等待着恢复军队的时机到来。复员军人均经日本警察的详细调查与登记，只要一下召集令，立刻就可以组成一支队伍。\n    扩充警察，建立陆军\n    战前仅有六万五千人之日本警察，屡经扩大，现日本政府已承认有十二万五千人。但实际据传已有三十万（据今年六月中国各界名流二百九十一人宣言及北平教授四百三十七人的宣言）。据世界知识十七卷十二期载称，现有警察大部分系复原军人。而指挥警察的最高机构，即直辖首相的所谓“国家保安委员会”，实为变相的陆军省。各地“警管区”，则为变相的“军管区”。本年五月一日成立的警政大学，乃是变相的士官学校或陆军大学。\n    另据本社山东六月二十九日电，最近由日本归国抵达我解放区之某专家谈，麦克阿瑟近在日本成立一类似过去军部之机构，简称“ＺＥＢ”，借口组织警察，实则密任征召、编训与武装日本陆军的任务。现在以警察名义入伍的日人，规定服役期为五年，以营为单位进行训练，每营七百至九百人，预期一九四九年底将完成三百个营。将来以五个日本营及一个美国营编成“美日混成旅”，并将配备以专由美军担任的炮兵、战车、及其他特种部队。\n    借口缉私，重建海军\n    海军方面，麦克阿瑟借口防止海上走私，本年初已将指定赔偿盟国之驱逐舰、潜水艇二十八艘交与日警使用。四月麦克阿瑟又不顾盟国舆论的反对，擅自准许日寇成立“海上保安厅”，拨予巡逻舰三十八艘，武装警员八千名。据四月五日东京新亚社电称：为避免国际舆论之攻击，该厅暂设于运输省编制之内，将来再谋扩大改组，而直隶于内阁。此种海上武装，拥有特级舰等一百二十五艘，共五万余吨。另据“世界知识”十七卷十二期载道：五月一日日政府成立“中央海上保安委员会”和“海上保安厅”，就是变相的海军省。各港口所设的“地方保安委员会”“海上保安部”以至“海上保安分部”，则类似过去的“镇守府”和“要港部”。加之日本造船炼钢水准，已为美国提高，重建舰队，并非难事。\n    至于海军基地，横须贺、佐世保、吴港等日本三大军港完好如昔，而且还加以扩充，增添了美国的新式技术装备。其他所有海军基地，据说三年内即将完全修复。\n    训练空军，建筑机场\n    空军方面，日本神风队的自杀航空队员，去年早有运至美国受训的消息，空军地面勤务人员及无线电员，亦由美占领军招募训练。关于建筑机场的报导更多。美国正在日本本土实现一个庞大的空军基地网计划。最新式的机场及其相应的兵营、军火仓库、军用公路等正在到处修建，原有的机场，有的已加扩充，有的已加修整，已经辟作农场的机场现又重新修建。例如最近美军占领当局所承认在日本本州北部青森建立之具大机场，有九千五百英尺长的跑道（其中八千五百英尺系用钢骨水泥筑的），可供现在美国建造中之最大巨型机使用。此飞机场已动工年余，有数千日人从事建筑，需费用一千三百万美元。现已完成工程的百分之六十，预期在年底方能竣工。占日本预算百分之四十到五十的所谓“占领军费”，实际上就是建筑基地的费用。据去年十一月六日日本经济安定本部长官和田博雄告日众院预算委员会称：日本重要建筑原料百分之三十已为占领军所征用。（未完）"

The entire army launched a \"Welcome New Soldiers Movement Week,\" and the military and political organs organized welcome committees to travel far and wide to extend greetings. On June 12th, the welcome committee arrived at ×× Village. Under the personal guidance of Director Zhang and Deputy Chief of Staff Liu, they swiftly completed various preparations. The streets and alleys were thoroughly cleaned, brand new archways were erected at each intersection, and colorful slogans were posted everywhere. Each dormitory in the reception center was marked with a number and bed assignment (how many people per room). The rooms were thoroughly cleaned, and the kang (sleeping platform) was neatly covered with mats and straw. The kitchen pots, bowls, ladles, and basins had long been put in place, and the water vats were filled to the brim. Supply personnel had prepared grain, firewood, oil, salt, and vegetables. The cultural troupe organized a propaganda shed and a costumed welcome team, and the Children's Corps of ×× Village also joined this welcome movement. At 2:00 PM on the 13th, the first group of new soldiers appeared at the village entrance. The whole village was immediately in an uproar, with gongs and drums, slogans, cheers... all blending into one. People enthusiastically twisted, danced, sang, and shouted. The old people in the village said, \"Even during the Spring Festival, it's not as lively as this!\" After an eight or nine-day long march, the new comrades, under such a warm welcome, were all so excited that they forgot their fatigue. Several new comrades in the ranks couldn't help but start twisting with the yangge dance team. Some new comrades, upon hearing slogans such as \"Defend our homes and fields\" and \"Avenge the people,\" couldn't help but shout, \"Yes! We must resolutely carry it through to the end!\" The next afternoon, a warm welcome meeting was held under the auspices of the welcome committee. Many new comrades voluntarily went on stage to speak. In the evening, the cultural troupe performed newly rehearsed programs such as \"Welcome New Soldiers.\"\n    [Further News] On June 11th, a certain commander of the department, at an enlarged cadre meeting, called on all veteran soldiers in the army to help the new soldiers well, to quickly understand and get used to the life in the company. He said: Every veteran soldier should care about and help the new comrades to progress. They should earnestly lead the new comrades to actively learn various military techniques and use opportunities during casual conversations to tell them about the organization and system within the company, the military and political discipline that should be observed, and what should be done every morning after waking up and after eating (daily schedule); they should tell the new comrades how to organize their personal belongings, how to place their clothes after taking them off at night, how to carry things, how to take care of weapons, and how to move quickly... He said: These problems should not only be told once or twice how to do them, but also explain in detail, little by little, why they should be done this way. Only when everyone understands these reasons will they be more motivated and easier to become familiar with.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东海部组织欢迎团  热烈欢迎新战士入伍  某司令员号召老战士帮助新战士\n\n1948-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东海部组织欢迎团\n    热烈欢迎新战士入伍\n    某司令员号召老战士帮助新战士\n    【北岳讯】东海部在北线战役结束后，欢迎大批翻身农民入伍，全军开展了欢迎新战士运动周，并由军政机关组织欢迎团远出欢迎。六月十二日，欢迎团到达××村，在张主任、刘副参谋长的亲自指导下，迅速的完成了各种准备工作。大街小巷进行了彻底的打扫，各个街口扎了崭新的牌楼，到处张贴了彩色标语。招待所的每一个宿舍门口，标明着号码与床位（住几个人），屋里打扫的很干净，炕上平平整整的铺好了席子和铺草。伙房里的锅、碗、瓢、盆早就安置好了，水缸里都挑满了水。供给人员们准备好了粮食、柴火、油盐蔬菜。文工团组织了鼓动棚与化装欢迎队，××村的儿童团也卷入这一欢迎运动。十三号下午两点钟，第一队新战士在村头出现了，村里村外顿时闹翻了天，锣鼓声，口号声，欢呼声，……混成一片。人们热情地扭着、跳着、唱着、呼喊着，该村老人们说：“过大年也没有这样烘火过！”经过八九天长途行军的新同志们，在这样热烈的欢迎下，一个个都兴奋的忘去了疲劳，有几个新同志在行列里，也情不自禁地随着秧歌队扭起来了。有的新同志听到“保家保田”、“为老百姓报仇”等口号时，不由的喊出：“对！我们一定要坚决干到底！”第二天下午，在欢迎团主持下，举行了热烈的欢迎大会。好多新同志自动到台上去讲了话，晚上文工团演出了新赶排的“欢迎新战士”等节目。\n    【又讯】六月十一日，该部某司令员在扩大干部会上，号召全军的老战士要好好帮助新战士，迅速了解与习惯连队的生活。他说：每个老战士应该关心、帮助新同志的进步。应该认真带领新同志积极学习各种军事技术，并利用平时闲谈的机会，告诉他们连里面的组织和制度，应该遵守的军事纪律与政治纪律，每天早晨起来和吃了饭应干的事情（作息时间）；要告诉新同志们怎样整理内务，晚上脱下衣服应该怎样放置，东西怎样背法，武器怎样保管，怎样动作才能迅速……。他说：这些问题不仅要一次一次告诉人们怎样做，还要详细地、一点一滴的说明为什么要这样做。只有叫大家都明白了这些道理，做起来才会更有劲，更容易熟悉。"

    "author": "Chai Fu",
    "date": "1948-07-13",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Strengthen Village-Level Water Conservancy Organizations\n    Lingzheng Canal Improves Water Usage Methods\n\n    [Our Dispatch] The Ling (Shou) Zheng (Ding) Canal Water Conservancy Committee has guided the masses in improving the water release system, overcoming waste, and enabling the universal irrigation of 600 hectares of land. The canal stretches from west of Niucheng Village in Lingshou County to the vicinity of Kou Village and Fengjia Village in Zhengding County, with a total length of 86 li including branch canals. In the past, village-level water conservancy organizations were not established and strengthened, making it impossible to implement water agreements, resulting in significant waste and frequent disputes. For example, whoever needed to irrigate would open the sluice gate; if those downstream were irrigating, those upstream would block the water supply when they wanted to irrigate, and some would even neglect to close the gate after irrigating, causing water overflow, which not only wasted water but also flooded land. The branch canals were eroded with holes everywhere. The third branch canal irrigated for more than 20 days, with some at the headwaters irrigated several times, while Sankou Village, the farthest from the canal entrance, was never irrigated. Currently, due to prolonged drought and no rain, the river water level has dropped, with the canal water depth only 6 *cun* (approximately 20 cm). If it is not used rationally, much of the irrigated land will turn into dry land. To correct the above deviations and ensure that all 600 hectares of land are irrigated, the Canal Water Conservancy Committee decided to reorganize village-level water conservancy organizations, increase water sources and reduce water consumption to combat the drought. After investigation and measurement, it organized the masses to dig a 1,000-meter canal westward along the Hutuo River to divert the discharge water from the Shuinian Tan of Pingshan and the Yongsheng Canal into the canal. Special personnel were assigned to patrol the canal entrance and the river dam, repairing any damage immediately. In addition, capable cadres were sent deep into the villages to specifically assist the masses in establishing and strengthening village water conservancy committees and dividing water usage groups, mobilizing the masses to irrigate the land in a planned and organized manner on a rotational basis. After the water conservancy organization in Qiantta Village was strengthened, the masses formulated water usage discipline: the land farthest from the canal entrance should be irrigated first, and then gradually rotate upwards, with those upstream not allowed to arbitrarily block the water of others. Irrigation households were grouped by section, and groups took turns inspecting the canals and blocking breaches. With the improvement of the water usage system, the irrigated area increased significantly. In the past, the village irrigated less than 700 *mu* of land in several water releases. This time, within three days, all 2,000 *mu* of land within Lingshou County were completely irrigated. Party members in Gaoping Village held their own meetings before water release to discuss leading the masses in irrigating the land, resolving to influence others through their exemplary role in abiding by water usage agreements. After reorganization, the 13 villages of the Third Branch Canal saved a lot of labor and irrigated the land quickly and well. Only Donghe and Gangtou villages still have some waste.

    "content": "(Hebei-Shandong-Henan News) In order to implement the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee on restoring and developing communication work, the Propaganda Departments of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Ninth District Party Committees have issued notices, instructing all counties and districts to conscientiously carry out communication and reporting work. The Propaganda Department of the Fourth District Party Committee stated in its instructions: Some cadres lack a correct understanding of opposing \"false reports\" raised during the Party rectification, and therefore adopt a passive attitude towards communication work. Fearing the examination of \"false reports,\" they simply don't write articles, thinking, \"If I don't write, I can't make mistakes.\" Two decisions were made: (1) The heads of the propaganda departments of each county must take practical responsibility and regard communication and reporting as a regular and primary task of their department, starting with promoting the already determined correspondents. In counties where a head of the propaganda department has not yet been appointed, a Party committee member should be designated to truly and effectively serve as the head of the propaganda department. Each county committee, district committee, and correspondent should immediately start writing. In the future, the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee will directly conduct inspections. (2) Reports should promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and on this basis, correct policies so that work does not deviate, or deviates less, overcoming the past \"empty talk\" style of emphasizing praise and not criticism, and one-sided exaggeration. The Propaganda Departments of the First, Second, Third, and Ninth District Party Committees have also recently issued instructions to various counties on restoring and developing communication work. The instructions from the First, Second, and Ninth District Party Committees stated: In the past, communication work was not considered important. From now on, its importance should be recognized from a political perspective, and communication and reporting work should be regarded as an important weapon in leadership. The instructions from the Ninth District Party Committee emphasized: County and district committees are required to take the initiative to take responsibility seriously and do a good job in communication work, and to earnestly arrange inspections. Each District Party Committee has instructed each county to appoint communication officers, requiring that communication work must be successful. The Ninth District Party Committee also proposed: For the convenience of the communication officer's work, they can work in the county office and organize the work reports and letters from each district into manuscripts. It is best to make two copies, one to be sent to the district committee branch and one to the newspaper office. After the original manuscript is revised, opinions are put forward and returned to the individual. This method of returning the manuscript can help the writer improve. If no one is making copies, the original manuscript can be sent to the branch, which will forward it to the newspaper office. The Propaganda Department of the First District Party Committee also decided that the communication officer, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, should regularly convene meetings to study, inspect, and summarize communication work. The Ninth District Party Committee emphasized: Write more; write about whatever you are doing; write as you speak, without being formal; one manuscript explains one thing; the original old correspondents should start writing first. The work of the county communication notices, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the Regional Party Committee, in addition to frequently contacting correspondents, carefully reviewing, registering, and forwarding manuscripts, must also regularly report the county's work situation and important issues in current work to the branch.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫各地委发出指示　加强通讯报导工作\n\n1948-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫各地委发出指示\n    加强通讯报导工作\n    【冀鲁豫讯】为执行区党委宣传部对恢复与开展通讯工作的指示，一、二、三、四、九各地委宣传部特发出通知，指示各县、区认真搞好通讯报导工作。四地委宣传部指示中说：有些干部对于整党中提出的反对“假报告”缺乏正确认识，因此对通讯工作抱消极态度，怕检查“假报告”，就干脆不写稿了，认为“我不写可不犯错了”。并作出两条决定：（一）各县宣传部长要切实负责，把通讯报导作为本部门经常的主要工作，首先从已确定的通讯员推动起。在尚没有配备宣传部长的县，应确定一个党委，名符其实的担任宣传部长。各县委、区委及通讯员，应立即动起笔来。今后地委宣传部要直接检查。（二）报导要发扬批评与自我批评的精神，在这个基础上端正政策，使工作不出偏向，或少出偏向，克服过去重表扬不批评，片面夸大的“客里空”作风。一、二、三、九等地委宣传部也在最近先后向各县发出恢复与发展通讯工作的指示，一、二、九地委指示中说：过去对通讯工作看得不重要，今后应从政治上来认识其重要性，应把通讯报导工作认为是领导上的重要武器。九地委指示中强调指出：县委、区委要求自动手认真负责，把通讯工作搞好，切实布置检查。各地委均指示各县配备通讯干事，要求务必把通讯工作作出成绩。九地委并提出：通讯干事为工作方便，可和县办公室一块办公，将各区工作报告、信件整理成稿件，最好复写两份，一份送地委支社，一份送报社。原稿经修改后，提出意见退回本人，这种退稿法能够帮助写稿人提高，如没人复写，可将原稿寄支社，由支社转报社。一地委宣传部并决定通讯干事在党委统一领导下，要经常的召集开会，研究、检查、总结通讯工作。九地委强调指出：要多写；作啥写啥；话怎样说就怎样写，不拘形式；一个稿说明一件事；原来的老通讯员要首先写起来。各县通讯启事的工作，按照区党委宣传部指示的精神，除去经常和通讯员连系，认真审阅、登记、转达稿件外，并要经常向分社汇报本县工作情况和当前工作中的重要问题。"

    "content": "Jilu Yu Administrative Office Calls for Drought Resistance\n    Seize the Time to Plant and Water Seedlings\n\n    [Jilu Yu News] In order to prevent and overcome the drought, the Jilu Yu Administrative Office has issued an emergency notice to all counties and districts, calling on them to seize the time to plant and water seedlings. It is said that there are only ten days left before the \"beginning of Fu,\" which is a crucial moment for sowing autumn seedlings. Due to the drought, a significant portion of wheat stubble fields in some areas of the Sixth and Eighth Special Districts have not been planted. Some of the seedlings that have emerged are also at risk of dying from drought. Some areas also need to be replanted due to severe hail (Sixth Special District) and insect plagues (First Special District). We should learn from the lessons of previous years; if we don't plant at this time, even if it rains heavily in ten days, yields will be reduced. To avoid waiting for disaster, all special districts, counties, districts, and villages are called upon to seize the current planting season and organize the masses to transport water for planting, replanting, and watering seedlings in an organized and led manner to minimize the threat of drought. (1) Overcome the masses' mentality of relying on the heavens for food and waiting for rain. Overcome the cadres' attitude of waiting and dealing with things passively, as well as tailism. Explain that such attitudes will cause a serious famine. If the planting season is missed, even if it rains later, planting will still reduce the autumn grain harvest, resulting in a semi-famine year. Planting early is always better than planting late; the harvest will be different even if the seedlings are only a day apart. (2) Fighting against drought, planting, and watering seedlings are our current important tasks, and also an active way to break the masses' superstitious and backward mentality and stabilize people's hearts. Therefore, we must have the perseverance to persuade the masses and help them, not be swayed by the emotions of backward elements, and resolutely organize the active and enthusiastic members of the peasantry with labor experience to take the lead in planting, promote the general, and focus leadership on planting. The current planting is mainly sweet potatoes, corn, and mung beans, especially major crops such as sweet potatoes. All localities should seize the time, based on the masses' experience, requirements, and different geological conditions, and call on and organize the masses to plant, and not miss the opportunity. Animal power, manpower, especially male and female semi-labor forces, should be organized to use carts, vats, buckets, jars, pots, etc., to transport pit water, well water, and ditch water for planting and watering seedlings. (3) Regarding the method of watering seedlings, the masses in the Fourth and Sixth Special Districts created a method last year, which is to insert wooden pegs diagonally next to the seedlings down to the roots, then water with a pot, and then bury the opening level; this can keep them from drying out for seven or eight days. If it still does not rain after seven or eight days, this method can be used again to water from the other side. According to the experience of the Fourth Special District last year, those who planted before the rain, even though the rain was past the proper time, could still harvest four to six dou per mu; those who planted after the rain could only harvest two dou per mu, a difference of more than double. Moreover, early planting leads to early maturity and early harvest, which avoids the loss of early frost and allows for earlier wheat planting. Therefore, in relatively large drought areas, we should widely call on and mobilize every household in every village to organize every labor force and semi-labor force to participate in planting and watering seedlings. Each person should plant half a mu to one mu to prevent drought. In areas where the masses lack planting experience, more attention should be paid to in-depth mobilization, organizing activists to take the lead in demonstration to influence the general public.机关 cadres stationed in the villages should help the masses plant and water seedlings in a planned and organized manner, and take the initiative to influence and promote the masses. We should recognize that helping the masses plant and water seedlings is of greater significance than helping with the wheat harvest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫行署号召抗旱　抓紧时间点种浇苗\n\n1948-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫行署号召抗旱\n    抓紧时间点种浇苗\n    【冀鲁豫讯】为了防止与战胜旱灾，冀鲁豫行署顷特向各县区发出紧急通知，号召抓紧时间，点种浇苗。据称：现在离“头伏”只有十几天了，正是播种秋苗的紧急关头。因天旱不雨，致六、八专区一部地区，很多麦茬地均未耩上。已经出土的小苗，有的也将旱死。有些地区因雹灾（六专区）、虫灾（一专区）严重，也需补种。应该接受往年教训，在这个时候如不点种，十天后即使大雨下了也会减收。为避免等待成灾，特号召各专、县、区、村，抓紧目前播种季节，有组织有领导的组织群众进行运水点种、补种和浇苗工作，以缩小旱灾威胁。（一）克办法服群众靠天吃饭、等待下雨的侥幸心理。克服干部等待应付的态度及尾巴主义。说明那种会造成严重灾荒。如果错过播种季节，即使以后下雨种上，也将使秋粮减收，形成半灾荒年景。早种总比晚种强，苗差一天收成就不一样。（二）与旱灾作斗争，点种、浇苗是我们当前的重要任务，也是打破群众迷信落后心理、安定人心的积极办法。因此，要有毅力的说服群众，帮助群众，不要为落后方面的情绪所动摇，坚决组织农民中积极的、有劳动热情、劳动经验的分子，首先带头点种，推动一般，领导重点应以点种为主。目前点种主要是红薯、玉蜀黍、绿豆，特别是红薯等主要作物。各地应根据群众经验、要求和地质的不同，抓紧时间，号召与组织群众点种，不得错过时机。应组织畜力、人力，特别是男女半劳动力，用大车、缸、桶、罐、壶等，灌运坑水、井水、沟水，进行点种浇苗。（三）浇苗方法，去年四、六专区群众曾有创造，即用木橛在苗旁斜插到根下，用壶灌水，然后埋平上口；这样可保持七、八天不旱，如七、八天后仍不下雨，可再用此法从另一边灌水。根据去年四专区经验，在雨前点种者，虽下雨已经过时，每亩仍能收四斗至六斗；雨后耩种者，每亩不过二斗，相差一倍之多。并且早种早熟早收，既避免早霜的损失，又可早日种麦。因此，在比较大的旱区，应广泛号召，动员每村每户，组织起每一劳动力和半劳动力，参加点种浇苗。每人要点种半亩至一亩，以防旱灾。在群众缺乏点种经验的地区，应更多注意深入动员，组织积极分子，带头示范影响一般。住村的机关干部，要有计划有组织的帮助群众点种浇苗，亲自动手影响推动群众。我们应认识帮助群众点种浇苗，比帮助麦收的意义更为重大。"

    "content": "Segmented Responsibility, Piecework by the Foot\n    Xingtang Completes the Shahe River Embankment\n\n    [This newspaper’s report] Xingtang repaired the Shahe River embankment, adopting a method of segmented responsibility and piecework by the foot, which was simple, fair, and improved work efficiency. Villages such as Bei@@ completed the embankment ahead of schedule and won a prize banner. Along the Shahe River in the county, from Hecun Village to Beigaolei, there was an original embankment fifteen li long, protecting fifteen villages and more than 15,300 mu of cultivated land. The lower section of this embankment was very low, and it was in danger of breaching whenever there was a major flood. In order to prevent floods and prepare for disasters, the county leadership sent a special person to be responsible for leading the construction, and each village established a river embankment committee to divide the work and responsibilities. The plan was to use 71,445 cubic feet of earth to raise the embankment by one or two feet to four or five feet. Construction officially began on May 11th. On the 13th, county and district cadres went to the county for a meeting, and the project automatically stopped. On the 24th, comrades Cui Shixian and Jia Lanhua from the county's Industry and Commerce Bureau conducted an investigation into the reason for the work stoppage. The masses said, \"It's not that we don't want to repair it, it's that the method is unfair and we can't afford to waste time.\" \"This embankment is repaired every year, but the superiors don't pay attention, and the slick people don't do a good job, which affects the good people who are also unwilling to do it.\" \"Five people can't do the work of one person, a lot of effort is wasted, and the results are not great.\" \"This is a wasteful canal.\" Comrades Cui and Jia discussed a proper solution with the embankment committee and decided to adopt the experience of Dong@@@@@@, stipulating the amount of soil each person should carry per day, assigning responsibility by segment according to the amount of labor in each village, and paying by the foot. First, it was divided to the village, and then from the village to the individual. It was stipulated that work would begin on May 25th and be completed by June 3rd. Whoever completed the plan first could stop working. The embankment committee also made a prize banner to award to the model village recognized by everyone. Everyone unanimously agreed with this fair method, and work efficiency quickly improved. The three villages of Bei@@, Dong, and Xi@@ completed the task two days ahead of schedule, and the four villages of Beigaolei, Jia Village, Huantong, and Nan@@ also completed it one day ahead of schedule. In the entire embankment repair process, many model figures emerged. For example, Wei Laoyuan and Jiang Jinyu of Jia Village carried 615 cubic feet of earth in one day. The old men Fan Luotao and Fan Luoyu in Bei@@, who were more than sixty years old, also carried an average of 110 cubic feet per day. Party member Jin Fu not only completed his own task but also helped others carry. Sun Qinghai, the industrial committee member and river embankment committee member of Bei@@, personally led the work and persevered to the end. Although he delayed a lot of work, he did not complain. The village was assigned 11,532 cubic feet of soil according to labor, and not only completed it ahead of schedule, but also exceeded the original plan. In the final assessment, each village recognized Bei@@ as a model village for embankment repair and won a red prize banner.\n\n　　　　　　        　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Shao Min)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 分段负责按尺计工　行唐完成沙河大堤\n邵民\n1948-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　分段负责按尺计工\n    行唐完成沙河大堤\n    【本报讯】行唐补修沙河大堤，采取分段负责按尺计工的办法，简易公平，提高了工作效率。北＠＠等村在修堤中提前完工，荣获奖旗。该县沙河沿岸由河合村至北高垒，原有十五里长的大堤一道，保护着十五个村庄及一万五千三百余亩耕地。该堤下段很低，一遇较大洪汛，即有决口的危险。该县领导为了防洪备灾，特派专人负责领导修筑，各村成立了河堤委员会，分工负责。计划以七万一千四百四十五立方尺土，将该堤埂加高一、二尺到四、五尺。五月十一日正式动工。十三日县区干部到县里开会，工程便自动停止了。二十四日县实业科派崔士贤、贾兰虎二同志考查停工原因，群众说：“不是不愿修，是办法不公平，误不起工。”“这堤每年补修，上级不注意，滑头人不好好干，影响好人也不愿干了。”“五个人干不了一个人的活，工夫耗的不少，成绩不大。”“这是道耗工渠”。崔、贾二同志和堤委会研究了妥善的办法，决定采用东＠＠＠＠的经验，规定每人每天抬土数量，按各村劳力多少，分段负责，按尺计工。先分到村，再由村分配到个人。规定五月二十五日开工，六月三日一律完工。谁先完成计划即可歇工。堤委会并作奖旗一面，奖给大家所公认的模范村。大家一致同意这个公平的办法，工作效率很快提高起来，北＠＠、东、西＠＠三村提前两天完成任务，北高垒、贾庄、欢同、南＠＠四村也提前完成一天。在整个修堤过程中，涌现了不少模范人物。如贾庄魏老远、蒋金玉二人，一天抬土六百十五立方尺，北＠＠六十多岁的老汉范洛涛、范洛雨每天平均也抬一百一十立方尺，党员金福除完成自己任务外，还帮助别人抬。北＠＠实业委员兼河堤委员孙清海亲自领工，坚持到底，虽耽误了不少工夫，但没一句怨言。该村按劳力分配一万一千五百三十二立方尺土，不仅提前完成，而且还超过原来计划，最后评工，各村公认北＠＠为修堤模范村，荣获红色奖旗一面。\n    　　　　　　        　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（邵民）"

In the past twenty days, over 600 enemies have been annihilated. On June 26th, enemy units from the Reorganized 4th Division, the Reorganized 23rd Division, and local bandits, totaling more than three regiments, invaded Huangqiao (northeast of Taixing) with hundreds of carts to loot grain. They were immediately routed by our local armed forces, with over 200 enemies killed or wounded. On the same day, we also annihilated over 80 members of the puppet security team, including the battalion commander, who had sallied forth from Taixing city. The local armed forces of the 6th Military Sub-district (governing Huaiyin, Shuyang, Lianshui counties, etc.) captured Nanjian, a central stronghold of the enemy north of Suqian, in mid-June, largely eliminating the local bandits in the Maling Mountain area and controlling the fertile grain-producing area north of Luoma Lake. The local armed forces of the 5th Military Sub-district (governing Yeting, Funing counties, etc.) routed an enemy company that was looting grain near Sujiazu, east of Huaian, on the 18th of last month, annihilating over 70 of them, including the company commander. On the 24th, the local armed forces of Haian (Haian town, newly established as a county) in the 1st Military Sub-district (governing Taixing, Rugao, Dongtai counties, etc.) intercepted three military speedboats and wooden boats of the Reorganized 4th Division sailing south from Dongtai, capturing over 40 of the division's quartermasters and others alive, and seizing a quantity of wheat and cotton. The local armed forces of the Huai-Bao Military Sub-district (newly established county between Huaian and Baoying) of the Jianghuai Military Region fought 54 battles in twenty days, thwarting the grain-grabbing conspiracy of the enemy's Provisional 35th Division and four battalions of the Reorganized 51st Division, annihilating over 200 enemies. In all the above battles, a total of nine machine guns and over 340 rifles and pistols were seized.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华中保麦战告捷连歼蒋匪六百余\n\n1948-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华中保麦战告捷连歼蒋匪六百余\n    【新华社华东十一日电】华中各地保麦战纷传捷音，近二十天歼敌六百多人。六月二十六日黄桥（泰兴东北）敌整四师、整二十三师各一部及土顽等共三个团以上兵力，携小车数百辆出犯抢粮，当被我地方武装击溃，杀伤敌二百余名。同日，我又歼自泰兴城出犯之伪保安队大队长以下八十余人。六分区（辖淮阴、沭阳、涟水等县）地方武装，上月中旬攻克宿（迁）北敌中心据点南涧，将马陵山地区土顽大部肃清，控制骆马湖以北丰饶之产麦区。五分区（辖叶挺、阜宁等县）地方武装，上月十八日在淮安东苏家咀一带击溃抢麦之敌一个连，歼其连长以下七十余名，二十四日一分区（辖泰兴、如皋、东台等县）海安（海安镇改设县治）地方武装，截获自东台南驶之整四师军用汽艇及木船三只，生俘该师军需等四十余名，缴获小麦、棉花各一部。江淮军区淮宝（淮安、宝应间新设县）地方武装二十天内作战五十四次，粉碎敌暂三十五师与整五十一师四个营的抢粮阴谋，歼敌二百余名。以上各次战斗共缴获机枪九挺，长短枪三百四十余支。"

    "content": "North China Military Column\n    Directs Development of Military Democracy\n    Emphasizing the Principle of Democratic Centralism to Harness Mass Wisdom and Enhance Combat Effectiveness\n    [Frontline News] The North China People's Liberation Army Military Column recently issued instructions on developing military democracy, emphasizing its role as a guiding ideology and principle for army building. The instructions clearly state the purpose of developing military democracy: to fully leverage the genius of the masses, concentrate the wisdom of millions of soldiers, and remedy the shortcomings in combat command, military training, and administrative management that commanders may overlook, thereby enhancing the correctness of leadership. To stimulate the initiative and creativity of the entire army, continuously improving tactics and techniques, and further harmonizing and uniting officer-soldier relations. To further regularize the troops and consolidate and enhance combat effectiveness. To this end, first, it is necessary to eliminate ideological obstacles among commanders and fighters and establish a correct understanding of military democracy. It is necessary to correct the erroneous thinking among some commanders who believe that implementing military democracy will lead to the development of extreme democracy, making management difficult, affecting personal prestige, and making it impossible to maintain discipline. At the same time, it is necessary to correct the thinking among some commanders and fighters who believe that military democracy allows them to disregard discipline, disobey orders, or use the shortcomings of superiors as an excuse to cover up their own mistakes. Second, it is imperative to correctly grasp the principle of democratic centralism. Third, under the unified leadership of the Party, military and political organs must strive for ideological and volitional unity, closely coordinate their work, and fully recognize this as an important long-term task in army building. It must be integrated with the combat and work tasks of each period. Regarding the steps and methods of development, the instructions decided: First, cadres should earnestly study the editorial of the East China People's Frontline Newspaper \"Several Principles for Developing Military Democracy\" and the part on army-building principles in \"On the Liberated Area Battlefield\" to understand its spirit, implement these instructions, and promptly discover and correct various erroneous understandings. Soldiers should be educated using methods such as class discussions, and then cadres and soldiers should all engage in self-reflection, especially cadres should conduct self-criticism, connecting with reality to clarify their thinking. Second, with the degree of ideological development, attention should be paid to cultivating and discovering typical examples, summarizing experiences, and promoting overall progress.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Du Daozheng)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北我军纵横部　指示开展军事民主  要在民主集中制的原则下发挥群众智慧提高战斗力\n杜导正\n1948-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华北我军纵横部\n    指示开展军事民主\n    要在民主集中制的原则下发挥群众智慧提高战斗力\n    【前线讯】华北解放军纵横部顷发布开展军事民主的指示，强调开展军事民主，作为建军的思想与方针。指示明确提出开展军事民主的目的是：充分发挥群众天才，使千百万战士群众的智慧集中起来，补救战斗指挥上，军事训练上，行政管理上指挥员看不到想不到的缺陷，增强领导的正确性。发挥全军的积极性，创造性，使战术与技术不断的改进与提高，官兵关系进一步融洽与团结。使部队更加正规化，使战斗力更加巩固与提高。为此，第一要扫除指战员中思想上的障碍，树立起正确的军事民主思想。要纠正某些指挥员中认为实行军事民主，就会发展极端民主，不好管理，影响个人威信，纪律无法维持等错误思想；同时纠正某些指战员中认为军事民主就可忽视纪律，不服从指挥，或借口上级某些缺点，掩盖自己的错误。第二，必须正确掌握民主集中制的原则。第三、必须在党的统一领导下，军政机关求得思想、意志上的一致，工作步调密切协同，并充分认识这是长期建军的重要任务。要和每个时期的战斗任务与工作任务渗透结合起来去进行。关于开展的步骤及方法，指示决定：第一步，干部中认真学习华东人民前线报社论“开展军事民主的几个原则”、“论解放区战场”的建军原则部分等基本文件，以领会其精神，贯彻这一指示，随时发现与纠正各种错误认识。战士中用上课讨论等方法进行教育，然后干部战士都要展开自我反省，尤其干部要有自我批评，联系实际打通思想。第二步，随着思想发展程度，随时注意培养和发现典型，总结经验，推动全盘。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（杜导正）"

    "content": "(Taihang News) The Taihang wheat harvest this year is quite good, with the general yield averaging over 60% to 70%. The summer wheat in the vast areas along the Pinghan and Daoqing lines has now been harvested and stored. The counties in eastern Jin, where the wheat matured latest, are also harvesting. Due to the heavy snowfall last winter and the even distribution of rainfall this spring, the counties in northern Henan, the wheat-producing area, mostly had yields of 70% to 80% this year, with an average yield of over 1.3 shi (market units) per mu, nearly double that of last year. According to a survey in the fourth special district of Qin, the area planted more wheat this year, and the harvest is good, so there should be no problem eating until autumn, alleviating the threat of hunger to the masses. The masses in Xiaozuo Village are even using wheat to buy livestock. They have bought four head in the past month and plan to buy five or six more. In some places in Ci County, the average yield per mu reached 1.6 shi (market units); although the geological conditions near Wu'an City are not good, the average yield per mu was still 7 to 8 dou. In Xiangyuan, Licheng, She County and other places where wheat production has historically been low, the wheat also grew very well this year, with an average yield of about 1 shi per mu. Li Shuangkui of Dongga Village, in the third district of She County, said: \"Listening to the government is never wrong. Last year, we were called upon to plant more, and this year we were told to hoe early. I planted 5.3 mu of wheat on my 6 mu of land, and I deep-hoed it early. Each ear has as many as fifty grains, and one mu yielded four big dou (each dou equals two market dou).\" The masses were all overjoyed, praising the wheat harvest as one of the \"three great things\" in production this year (the others being good cotton seedlings and good spring vegetables). Last year, the Taihang area suffered from drought, hail, and other disasters, and the summer and autumn harvests were generally poor. In order to make up for this loss and help the masses tide over this year's spring famine, leading organs at all levels repeatedly called on the masses to expand wheat fields and tried every means (such as loans, adjusting seeds, and organizing the masses to plant in series and early planting, etc.) to organize the masses to plant wheat. Shahe, Xingtai, Wu'an, Lin County and more than a dozen other counties expanded their wheat fields by 20% to 30% compared with the year before, accounting for 50% to 70% of the total land area. Zuoquan, Yushe, Wuxiang and other ten counties expanded their wheat fields by 200,000 mu, an increase of 33% compared with the year before, accounting for 30% to 40% of the total land area. Xiyang County, which has always rarely planted wheat, also expanded its wheat area by three and a half times compared with last year, with an average of 0.5 mu of wheat land per person.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行小麦收成尚好\n\n1948-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行小麦收成尚好\n    【太行讯】太行今年小麦收成尚好，一般收成平均在六、七成以上。现平汉、道清沿线广大地区夏麦已收好入仓。成熟最迟的晋东各县亦在收割。因去年冬雪较多，今春雨水调匀，产麦区豫北的诸县，今年多是七、八成收，每亩平均打一石三斗（市斗）以上，比去年超过将近一倍。据四专区沁调查，该地今年麦子种的多，收成又好，吃到秋天不成问题，解除了饥饿对群众的威胁。肖作村群众并拿上麦子买牲口。最近一月内已买了四头，还计划买五、六头。磁县有些地方每亩平均收到一石六斗（市斗）；武安城附近地质虽然不好，每亩也平均收七、八斗。产麦历来较少的襄垣、黎城、涉县等地，今年麦子长的也很好，每亩收到一石左右。涉县三区东戛村李双魁说：“听政府话就是没错。去年号召多种，今年让早锄，我六亩地种了五亩三分麦子，早早深锄了一遍，每个穗子足有五十多颗，一亩就打了四大斗（每斗合二市斗）。”群众都喜形于色，将麦收誉为今年生产上的“三大好”之一（余为棉苗好，春菜好）。按去年太行区因旱雹等灾，夏秋普遍歉收，各级领导机关为弥补这一损失，帮助群众渡过今年春荒，曾多次号召群众扩大麦田；并想尽各种办法（如借贷、调剂种子，组织群众串种、早种等）组织群众种麦。沙河、邢台、武安、林县等十余县，比前年扩大麦田百分之二十至三十，占土地总面积百分之五十至七十。左权、榆社、武乡等十县扩大麦田二十万亩，较前年增加百分之三十三，占总土地面积百分之三十到四十。向来很少种麦的昔阳县，也比去年扩大了三倍半，平均每人有五分麦地。"

However, we must pay close attention to the fact that we are still in a war environment, and we must pay attention to the threat of famine. In order to strive to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, we have a huge task of supporting the front lines. The enemy in the border areas of our region is still trying to seize grain at all times, which requires serious attention. Currently, various places are already experiencing a lack of rain. Some areas have not yet been sown after the wheat harvest, and in some areas, although they have been sown, the autumn seedlings are already suffering from drought. Our region experiences drought nine years out of ten, and the possibility of drought is very high.

    "content": "Taihang News: Parts of Lucheng, Heshun, Pingshun, and Zhangnan counties were recently struck by hailstorms around the 20th of last month, causing heavy damage to wheat and autumn seedlings. Local democratic governments are dispatching personnel to comfort the affected masses, issue loans to solve seed shortages, and organize the rescue and replanting of seedlings. Statistics from 14 villages in the fourth and fifth districts of Lucheng show that more than 7,100 mu of wheat and more than 15,600 mu of autumn seedlings were destroyed. The wheat harvest was greatly reduced, with severely affected areas yielding only 20% of the crop. In the first and seventh districts of Heshun, 13 villages suffered hailstorms across more than 3,200 mu. Parts of the fifth and sixth districts were also affected. Twelve administrative villages in the second district of Pingshun suffered damage. In Nansai, Chidi and other four villages alone, 226 mu of wheat fields were affected, reducing yields by four-fifths. More than ten villages in the seventh district of Zhangnan suffered hailstorms at noon on the 21st. The next morning, County Head Bai personally went to the affected areas to comfort the masses, and allocated loans of 1.6 million yuan (Jizhao currency, same below) and more than 1,000 jin of jade, water caltrop and bean seeds to solve the difficulties of replanting for the masses. Heshun has sent special personnel to issue loans of 2 million yuan to solve the seed difficulties for the masses and seize the opportunity to carry out replanting. After comforting the masses to understand the disaster situation, the head of the Lucheng County Government Cooperative Section immediately convened a mass meeting to discuss the situation. Everyone came up with methods such as supporting seedlings and replanting. The seed problem was solved by mutual borrowing among the masses and the cooperative section taking responsibility for coordination. Now the masses are actively replanting autumn seedlings and harvesting the damaged wheat. Wang Keze, deputy district head of the second district of Pingshun, went to the villages to comfort the masses, and organized sideline production and replanting as soon as the hailstorm had just stopped. Village cadres in Nansai took the initiative to clearly divide the work and lead the masses to formulate a production and saving plan to overcome the famine, replant autumn fields, eliminate cooked wasteland, plant naked oats, open up wasteland to plant late vegetables, collect wild vegetables, and organize transportation, weaving, and medicinal herb digging to save and overcome the famine.\n\nThis newspaper reports: Locust nymphs were discovered in Anyang, Linxian, Shahe, Cixian and other counties in Taihang in late June, damaging more than 7,000 mu of green seedlings. In Xigang Village and Xiaobeigou in the first district of Anyang, the affected area exceeded 100 mu; a single area in the south of Shuiye had more than 600 mu affected; the villages of Beima, Nantongye and others in the second district, the area around Donghuiying in the fourth district, Qugou in the fifth district, Shijian and Fucheng in the sixth district, and Dongxi Shangzhuang and other villages in the eighth district were also successively discovered to be affected. More than 3,000 mu of grain seedlings have been eaten away in Matoujian, Lishigejian, Fen'ao, Baitou and other villages in the ninth district. More than 900 mu of nineteen villages in the seventh district have been eaten up. At the junction of Xinsizhuang, Xizuo Village, Niu'erzhuang, Shangguanzhuang and other villages in the eighth district of Cixian, locust nymphs were discovered and have damaged more than ten qing of green seedlings. Grasshoppers were discovered in the eighth and ninth districts of Linxian, and the ninth district ate more than 1,000 mu of autumn seedlings. Locust nymphs were also discovered in Dalianzhen in the sixth district of Shahe, damaging up to more than 900 mu of small seedlings. According to veteran farmers, the reason for the occurrence of locust nymphs this year is that the wheat fields were not plowed after intercropping last year, and there was no shortage of rain this spring, and the land was wet and the weather was hot, which is suitable for the development of locust nymphs. The counties where locust nymphs have been discovered are actively organizing capture and eradication. The special commissioner's office has also notified the counties to quickly inspect and organize the masses to eliminate the locust plague in the nymph stage. The seventh district of Anyang has organized a locust eradication headquarters, and the joint defense has established a branch headquarters to lead women and children in capture and eradication. More than 1,100 people from thirteen villages in the seventh district of Cixian participated in locust fighting. Since the 23rd of last month, 60% of the locust nymphs have been eliminated in two days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行部分地区遭受雹灾  政府积极领导补种　安阳林县等地发现蝗蝻\n\n1948-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行部分地区遭受雹灾\n    政府积极领导补种\n    安阳林县等地发现蝗蝻\n    【太行讯】上月二十日前后，潞城、和顺、平顺、漳南等县部分地区突遭雹灾，麦子秋苗损失甚重，各地民主政府正派员安慰受灾群众，发放贷款，解决种子困难，组织救苗补种。潞城四、五两区十四个村统计，打毁麦子七千一百多亩，秋苗一万五千六百多亩，麦子收成大减，灾重者只收十分之二。和顺一、七两区十三个村，被雹灾面积三千二百多亩。五、六两区也有部分村庄受害。平顺二区十二个行政村遭灾。仅南赛、池底等四村被灾麦田二百二十六亩，减收五分之四。漳南七区十余村于二十一日中午遭雹灾，次日上午白县长亲自到受灾区安慰群众，并拨贷款一百六十万元（冀钞，下同），玉菱、豆种千余斤，解决群众补种的困难。和顺已派专人发放二百万元贷款，解决群众种子困难，抓紧时机进行补种。潞城县府合作科长于慰问了解群众的受灾情况后，马上召开群众大会讨论，大家想出扶苗、补种等办法。种子问题，采取群众互借和合作科负责调剂的办法解决。现群众正积极补种秋苗，收割被打毁的麦子。平顺二区副区长王科则等在冰雹刚下罢了，就涉水下乡，到被灾各村去安慰群众，组织副业与补种。南赛村干部亲自动手，明确分工，带领群众订出生产节约渡荒计划，补种秋地，消灭熟荒，种莜麦，开荒种晚菜，采野菜，组织运输、纺织、刨药材等生产，节约渡荒。\n    【本报讯】太行安（阳）、林（县）、沙（河）、磁（县）等县在六月下旬发现蝗蝻，吃坏青苗七千余亩。安阳一区西岗村、小背沟受灾面积有百多亩；水冶南关一片即有六百余亩；二区北马、南铜冶等村，四区东灰营一带，五区曲沟，六区石涧、阜城等村，八区东西上庄等村也先后发现。九区马投涧、李史葛涧、坟凹、白塔等村已被吃坏谷苗三千多亩。七区十九个村被吃光的有九百多亩。磁县八区辛寺庄、西佐村、牛二庄、上官庄等村交界处发现蝗蝻，已吃坏青苗十顷多。林县八、九两区发现蚂蚱，九区吃了秋苗一千多亩。沙河六区褡裢镇亦发现蝗蝻，吃坏小苗达九百多亩。据老农谈：今年发生蝗蝻原因，系因去年麦地串种没有犁地，今春雨水不缺，地湿天热，适合蝗蝻发展。发现蝗蝻县份，正积极组织捕打，专署亦通报各县，迅速检查，组织群众把蝗灾消灭在蝗蝻阶段。安阳七区已组织剿蝗指挥部，联防成立分指挥部，领导妇女儿童进行捕打。磁县七区十三个村参加打蝗者有一千一百多人，上月二十三日开始，两天已消灭蝗蝻百分之六十。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 10th: The Information Bureau Conference, attended by representatives of the Communist Parties of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and Italy, was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, in the second half of June. The representatives present were: Bulgaria—Kostov, Chervenkov; Romania—Pauker, Dej, Luca; Hungary—Rákosi, Gerő; Poland—Bierut, Zambrowski; Soviet Union—Zhdanov, Malenkov, Suslov; France—Duclos, Fajon; Czechoslovakia—Slánský, Široký, Geminder, Ďuriš; Italy—Togliatti, Secchia. The conference discussed the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and adopted and published a resolution on this issue. We hereby publish the following translation of the resolution, based on the Russian-language broadcast of Pravda in Moscow on June 29th, which has been preliminarily proofread:\n\n\t\tCominform Resolution on the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia\n\nThe Information Bureau Conference, attended by representatives of the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist), the Romanian Workers' Party, the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Polish Workers' Party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolshevik), the French Communist Party, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and the Italian Communist Party, having discussed the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and noting that the representatives of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have refused to attend this Information Bureau Conference, unanimously adopts the following resolution:\n\n\t\tI.\nThe Information Bureau points out that the leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have recently been pursuing an incorrect line in their domestic and foreign policies that deviates from Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Information Bureau approves the initiative of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) in exposing the incorrect policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, especially Comrades Tito, Kardelj, Djilas, and Ranković.\n\n\t\tII.\nThe Information Bureau confirms that the leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia are pursuing an unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union and the CPSU(B). In Yugoslavia, a shameful policy of slander against Soviet military experts and distrust of the Soviet Army is permitted. A special system was established in Yugoslavia to deal with Soviet non-military personnel, under which they were placed under surveillance by the Yugoslav state security organs, and their movements were followed. Yudin, the representative of the CPSU(B) to the Information Bureau, and many Soviet official representatives stationed in Yugoslavia were subjected to the same surveillance and shadowing by the Yugoslav state security organs.\n\nThese and similar facts prove that the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia hold a position that is unbecoming of a communist, and because of this position, they have begun to equate the foreign policy of the Soviet Union with the foreign policy of imperialism and treat the Soviet Union with the same attitude they treat bourgeois countries. It is precisely because of the anti-Soviet stance of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia that slanderous propaganda about the degeneration of the CPSU(B), the degeneration of the Soviet Union, and similar fabrications, stolen from the anti-revolutionary Trotskyist arsenal, have been disseminated within the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Information Bureau believes that this anti-Soviet stance is incompatible with Marxism-Leninism and is only suitable for a nationalist position.\n\n\t\tIII.\nIn its domestic policy, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have departed from the standpoint of the working class and deviated from the Marxist theory of classes and class struggle. They deny the growth of capitalist elements in the country and the resulting intensification of class struggle in the Yugoslav countryside. This denial stems from an opportunist viewpoint, as if the transition from capitalism to socialism is not a sharpening of the class struggle, as Marxism-Leninism teaches us, but a gradual weakening of the class struggle, as the Bukharinist opportunists advocate in their \"theory\" of the peaceful growth of capitalism into socialism.\n\nThe Yugoslav leaders are also pursuing an incorrect policy in the countryside, ignoring the class differentiation in the countryside and viewing the individual economy as a whole. Contrary to Marx, Lenin's theory of classes and class struggle, in violation of Lenin's famous argument, Lenin said: small individual economy \"daily, hourly, constantly, spontaneously, and on a mass scale gives rise to capitalism and the bourgeoisie.\" However, there is no basis for self-satisfaction and complacency regarding the political situation in the Yugoslav countryside. When individual peasant economy dominates in Yugoslavia, the land has not been nationalized, private ownership of land and the buying and selling of land exist, and most of the land in the country is still concentrated in the hands of rich peasants and wage labor is employed, etc., the party cannot disarm itself in the face of the difficulties of socialist construction by educating the party in the spirit of blurring the class struggle and reconciling class contradictions.\n\nThe leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have departed from Marxism-Leninism on the issue of the leading role of the working class and have moved towards the path of the Narodnik kulak party, believing that \"the peasantry is the most solid foundation of the Yugoslav state.\" Lenin taught us: \"The proletariat is the only class in modern society that is revolutionary to the end. In the struggle of the entire people for a thorough democratic revolution, in the struggle of all laborers, the exploited, and those who oppose the oppressors and exploiters, it should become the leader and guide.\"\n\nThe leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have undermined this Marxist-Leninist argument.\n\nAs for the peasants, the majority of them, namely the poor and middle peasants, can and have formed an alliance with the working class, but the leading role in this alliance still belongs to the working class.\n\nThe above-mentioned position of the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia is a violation of the principles of Marxism-Leninism.\n\nIt is obvious that the views expressed in this position are suitable for a petty-bourgeois democratic view, not a Marxist-Leninist view.\n\n\t\tIV.\nThe Information Bureau believes that the leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have revised the Marxist-Leninist theory of the Party. According to Marxist-Leninist theory, the Party is the basic leading and guiding force in the country, with its own special program, and is not dissolved in non-Party mass organizations. The Party is the highest organizational form and the most important weapon of the working class. But in Yugoslavia, it is believed that the basic leading force in the country is not the Communist Party, but the People's Front. The leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia are reducing the role of the Communist Party, actually dissolving the Party in the non-Party People's Front, which includes various elements with very complex class relations (workers, laboring peasants engaged in individual economy, rich peasants, merchants, small business owners, bourgeois intellectuals, etc.), and also includes various political factions, including bourgeois political parties. The Yugoslav leaders stubbornly refuse to admit the errors of their position, believing that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia cannot have and should not have its own special program, but should be satisfied with the program of the People's Front. The fact that only the People's Front is active on the Yugoslav political stage, and that the Communist Party and its organizations do not openly operate in front of the people in their own name, not only reduces the role of the Party in the domestic political life, but also causes the Party to lose its status as an independent political force. The mission of the Party is to gain greater trust from the people and further expand its influence on the broad masses of working people through open political activities and through open propaganda of its views and its program. The leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia are repeating the mistakes of the Russian Mensheviks, namely the error of dissolving the Marxist Party in non-Party mass organizations. All this proves that there is a liquidationist tendency within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Information Bureau believes that this policy endangers the very survival of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and ultimately contains the danger of a degeneration of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n\t\tV.\nThe Information Bureau believes that the bureaucratic system created by the Yugoslav leaders within the Party is a fatal danger to the survival and development of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. There is no democracy, no elections, no criticism and self-criticism within the Party. Contrary to the statements of Comrades Tito and Kardelj, the majority of the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia are not elected, but recommended. The Communist Party is actually in a semi-legal position. The Party does not convene Party meetings or convenes them in secret, which cannot but harm the Party's influence among the masses. This organizational form of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia can only be called a sectarian bureaucratic form. This form leads to the elimination of the Party as an active and independent organization and fosters methods of military leadership within the Party, just like the methods of leadership formerly used by Trotsky.\n\nWithin the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, even the most basic rights of Party members are deprived, and even a slight criticism of incorrect things within the Party is met with cruel suppression. This phenomenon is completely intolerable. The Information Bureau believes that the fact that Comrades Jujović and Hebrang, members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, were expelled from the Party and arrested for daring to criticize the anti-Soviet stance of the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and advocating friendship between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, is shameful.\n\nThe Information Bureau believes that such a shameful, Turkish-style system of terror should never be allowed in the Communist Party. The interests of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia's own existence and development require the elimination of this system.\n\n\t\tVI.\nThe Information Bureau believes that the criticism of the errors committed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Central Committees of other Communist Parties is a form of fraternal assistance. These criticisms provide the leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia with all the necessary conditions to correct the errors they have committed as quickly as possible. However, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, who are infected with extreme arrogance, complacency, and self-importance, do not sincerely accept these criticisms, do not correct the errors they have committed in a Bolshevik manner, but instead adopt a hostile attitude of armed confrontation towards criticism, embarking on an anti-Party road of denying their own errors altogether, undermining the Marxist-Leninist theory of the Party's attitude towards its own errors, and thus further aggravating their anti-Party errors.\n\nAfter the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia revealed their bankruptcy in the face of the criticisms of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Central Committees of other fraternal Communist Parties, they began to directly deceive their own Party and people, concealing this criticism of the incorrect policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia from the Party, and concealing the true reasons for punishing Comrades Jujović and Hebrang from the Party and the people.\n\nRecently, after the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia were criticized by the Central Committee of the CPSU and other fraternal parties, they attempted to announce a series of new left-wing measures. The leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia hastily promulgated a new resolution on the nationalization of small industrial and commercial enterprises. The implementation of this resolution was unprepared, and due to this haste, the implementation of this resolution can only cause difficulties for the livelihood of the people of Yugoslavia. They hastily promulgated a new law on the collection of grain taxes from peasants, which was also unprepared. Therefore, the new law can only cause chaos in the grain supply to urban residents. Finally, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia recently declared their love and loyalty to the Soviet Union, although everyone knows that they are still implementing an unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union.\n\nBut not only that, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have recently confidently announced a policy of eradicating capitalist elements in Yugoslavia. In a letter to the Central Committee of the CPSU on April 13th of this year, Tito and Kardelj wrote: \"The enlarged meeting of the Central Committee approved the plan proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee to eliminate the remnants of capitalism in the country.\"\n\nAccording to this view, Kardelj declared in his speech to the Federal National Assembly of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia on April 25th: \"All the remnants of human exploitation in our country have only a few days left.\"\n\nThe view of the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia that capitalist elements should be eliminated under the existing conditions in Yugoslavia, that is, the elimination of the rich peasant class, can only be adventurous and non-Marxist, and nothing else. Because, when individual peasant economy, which inevitably produces capitalism, dominates in the country, when the conditions for large-scale collectivization of the rural economy are not yet available, and when the majority of working people have not yet been convinced of the superiority of the collective methods of agricultural operation, it is absolutely impossible to accomplish this task. The experience of the CPSU proves that it is only possible to eliminate the last and most numerous exploiting class, the rich peasant class, on the basis of large-scale collectivization of the rural economy; and the elimination of the rich peasant as a class is an organic component of the collectivization of the rural economy.\n\nIn order to successfully eliminate the rich peasant as a class, and thus eliminate capitalist elements in the countryside, it is required that the Party conduct preliminary long-term preparations to limit capitalist elements in the countryside, consolidate the alliance of the working class and the peasantry under the leadership of the working class, and develop socialist large-scale industry capable of organizing mechanized agricultural operations. Impatience in this work can only bring irreparable damage.\n\nIt is only possible to move from limiting capitalist factors in the countryside to eliminating them on the basis of careful preparation and thorough implementation of these measures.\n\nAll attempts by the leaders of Yugoslavia to solve this task by hasty means and government decrees are merely doomed adventures and merely arrogant and empty declarations to incite the people.\n\nThe Information Bureau believes that the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia want to use similar hypocritical and demagogic tactics to show that they not only stand on the position of class struggle, but also greatly exceed those requirements that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia can do in limiting capitalism from the perspective of realistic possibilities.\n\nThe Information Bureau believes that all these laws and declarations of the leaders of Yugoslavia are inflammatory to the people, and are currently impossible to achieve. They can only tarnish the banner of socialist construction in Yugoslavia.\n\nTherefore, the Information Bureau believes that these adventurous policies are base tactics and unacceptable political gambling.\n\nObviously, the above-mentioned left-leaning demagogic measures and declarations of the Yugoslav leaders are attempts to cover up their refusal to admit errors and their refusal to sincerely correct their errors.\n\n\t\tVII.\nConsidering the situation created within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and in order to give the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia a way out, the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Central Committees of other fraternal parties proposed that the issue of the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia should be reviewed in the same way as the general Party principles for reviewing the activities of other Communist Parties at the First Information Bureau Conference. However, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia have repeatedly rejected the proposals of other fraternal parties to discuss the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia at the Information Bureau Conference. In order to evade the legitimate criticism of fraternal parties at the Information Bureau Conference, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia fabricated the claim that they were \"in an unequal position\". It should be pointed out that this claim is completely untrue. Everyone knows that when the Information Bureau was organized, the Communist Parties proceeded precisely from the principle that any Party should report on its work to the Information Bureau, and any Party has the right to criticize other Parties. At the first conference of the nine Communist Parties, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia widely exercised the right to criticize other Parties. But the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia refused to report on their work to the Information Bureau and refused to listen to the criticisms of other Communist Parties. This shows that the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia are truly undermining the principle of equality among the Communist Parties, which is equivalent to demanding that a special status be established for the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the Information Bureau.\n\n\t\tVIII.\nConsidering all the above-mentioned facts, the Information Bureau approves the assessment of the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia by the Central Committee of the CPSU, the criticism of the errors of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and the political analysis of these errors in the letters from the Central Committee of the CPSU to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia from March to May 1948.\n\nThe Information Bureau unanimously concludes that the anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Party, and anti-Soviet views and all actions of the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, as well as their refusal to attend the Information Bureau Conference, are placing themselves in opposition to the Communist Parties of all countries participating in the Information Bureau, embarking on the path of splitting the unified anti-imperialist socialist front, betraying the international solidarity of the workers, and turning to a nationalist position.\n\nThe Information Bureau condemns this anti-Party policy and actions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Information Bureau believes that, in this way, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia has placed itself and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia outside the family of its fraternal parties, outside the unified communist front, and therefore outside the ranks of the Information Bureau.\n\nThe Information Bureau believes that the root cause of these errors of the leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia is an undeniable fact, namely: in the leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, in the recent five or six months, nationalist elements who had previously been hidden have openly gained the upper hand, causing the leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to deviate from the internationalist traditions of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and move towards the path of nationalism.\n\nThe leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia overestimate the internal national strength and potential capacity of Yugoslavia. They believe that without the support of the Communist Parties of the world, without the support of the people's democratic countries, and without the support of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia can maintain its independence and build socialism. They believe that without the assistance of revolutionary forces, the new Yugoslavia can also survive.\n\nThe leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia do not understand the international situation and the scare tactics of the imperialists, believing that making certain concessions to the imperialist countries can win their favor and negotiate with these countries to maintain the independence of Yugoslavia, thus gradually prompting the various nationalities of Yugoslavia to tend towards the imperialist countries, that is, towards capitalism. On this point, the leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia are obviously proceeding from the well-known bourgeois nationalist program, which believes that: \"The danger of capitalist countries to Yugoslavia is less than the danger of the Soviet Union to Yugoslavia.\"\n\nThe leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia obviously do not understand, or may be pretending not to understand, that this nationalist position may cause Yugoslavia to degenerate into a general bourgeois republic, lose the independence of Yugoslavia, and turn Yugoslavia into a colony of imperialist countries.\n\nThe Information Bureau does not doubt that within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia there are full forces loyal to Marxism-Leninism, loyal to the internationalist traditions of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and loyal to the unified socialist front.\n\nThe task of these sound forces of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia is to force today's leaders to openly and sincerely admit their errors, correct these errors, depart from nationalism, return to internationalism, and consolidate the unified anti-imperialist socialist front by all means; or, if the current leaders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia prove to be incapable of this, then replace them and elect new internationalist leading organs of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Information Bureau does not doubt that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia is capable of accomplishing this glorious task.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 情报局关于南共的决议\n\n1948-07-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　情报局关于南共的决议\n    【新华社陕北十日电】保、罗、匈、波、苏、法、捷、意各国共产党代表参加的情报局会议，六月下半月在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特举行。到会各国代表为：保——科斯托夫，捷尔文科夫；罗——波克，德治，卢基；匈——拉西科，杰尔斯；波——培尔曼，萨拉克斯基；苏——日丹诺夫，马林科夫，苏斯洛夫；法——杜克洛，法戎；捷——斯朗斯基，西罗基，詹明德，奥莱士；意——托格里亚蒂，谢杰。会议讨论了南斯拉夫共产党状况问题，并作出了和公布了关于这个问题的决议。本社兹根据莫斯科俄语广播真理报六月廿九日所载该项决议录音译出，并经过初步校正，发表如下：\n    　　　　情报局关于南斯拉夫共产党状况的决议\n    保加利亚工人党（共产党）、罗马尼亚工人党、匈牙利劳动人民党、波兰工人党、苏联共产党（布尔塞维克）、法国共产党、捷克斯拉夫共产党及意大利共产党之代表所参加之情报局会议，在讨论了南斯拉夫共产党的状况问题，并认为南斯拉夫共产党代表已拒绝出席此次情报局会议之后，一致通过下列决议：\n    　　一、\n    情报局指出：南共领导机关最近时期，在对内和对外政策之基本问题上，进行着一种脱离马克思主义——列宁主义的不正确的路线。因此，情报局赞同联共党（布）中央之主动揭露南斯拉夫共产党中央，首先是铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇等同志的不正确的政策。\n    　　二、\n    情报局确认：南共领导机关对苏联和对联共党（布）进行着非友好的政策。在南斯拉夫，允许对苏联军事专家的诬蔑及对苏军不信任的可耻的政策。为对付苏联非军事人员，在南斯拉夫曾创立了一种专门制度，由于这种制度，他们曾被置于南斯拉夫国家保卫机关监视之下，他们的行动并受到钉梢。驻情报局之联共党（布）代表尤金及驻南斯拉夫之苏联许多官方代表，都遭受了南斯拉夫国家保卫机关这种同样的监视和钉梢。\n    这些事实及其同类事实证明：南共领导者抱着一种共产党员不应有的立场，由于这种立场，南共领导者开始把苏联的对外政策和帝国主义的对外政策混为一谈，并把它对待资产阶级国家的同样态度对待苏联。正是由于南共中央的反苏立场，从反革命的托洛茨基武库中窃用来的关于联共党（布）蜕化、苏联蜕化及其类似的诽谤宣传，在南共中央中才得到了散布。\n    情报局认为：这种反苏立场，是与马克思主义——列宁主义不相容的，只是适合于民族主义的立场。\n    　　三、\n    在对内政策上，南共领导者离开了工人阶级的立场，脱离了马克思主义关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论。他们否认国内资本主义成份的增长，和由此而产生的阶级斗争在南斯拉夫农村中的加剧。这种否认是从机会主义的观点出发，似乎从资本主义到社会主义的过渡阶段，不是阶级斗争的尖锐化，如象马列主义所教导我们的那样；而是阶级斗争的逐渐削弱，如象布哈林式的机会主义者所鼓吹的资本主义和平长为社会主义的“理论”一样。\n    南斯拉夫领导者在农村中也进行一种不正确的政策，忽视了农村的阶级分化，把个体经济看成是一个整体。违背马克思、列宁关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说，违反列宁的著名论证。列宁说：小的个体经济“每日、每时、不断地、自发地、大量地产生资本主义和资产阶级”。可是，南斯拉夫农村中的政治状况，并没有任何能令人自安自慰和高枕无忧的根据。当在南斯拉夫个体农民经济占着优势，土地未实行国有化，存在着土地私有制及土地买卖制，全国大部分土地还集中在富农手中及采取雇佣劳动等等的条件下，不能以模糊阶级斗争和调和阶级矛盾的精神教育党，这样，才能使党在社会主义建设的困难面前，不致解除武装。\n    南共领导者在关于工人阶级领导作用的问题上，离开了马克思主义——列宁主义，而走向民粹主义富农党的道路上去，认为“农民是南斯拉夫国家的最坚固的基础”。列宁教导我们说：“无产阶级是近代社会唯一的革命到底的阶级，在全体人民争取彻底的民主革命斗争中，在一切劳动者、被剥削者、反压迫者与剥削者的斗争中，应当成为领导者和领袖。”\n    南共领导者破坏了这种马克思主义——列宁主义的论点。\n    至于谈到农民，那么农民的大多数，也就是贫农和中农，能够和工人阶级结成联盟，或者已结成联盟，而这个联盟中的领导作用仍属于工人阶级。\n    上述的南共领导者的立场，是破坏了马克思主义——列宁主义的原则的。\n    很明显的，这个立场表现出来的观点是适合于小资产阶级民主主义的观点，而不是马列主义的观点。\n    　　四、\n    情报局认为南共领导机关修改马克思主义——列宁主义关于党的学说。根据马列主义理论，党是国内基本领导力量和指导力量，有自己的特别政纲，而不是溶化在非党群众组织中。党是工人阶级之最高组织形式和最重要的武器。可是在南斯拉夫，认为国内基本领导力量不是共产党，而是人民阵线。南共领导者降低共产党的作用，实际上是使党溶化在非党的人民阵线中，这个非党人民阵线包括着在阶级关系上非常复杂的各种分子、工人、从事个体经济的劳动农民、富农、商人、小企业主、资产阶级知识分子等），而且同样还包括形形色色的政治派别，也包括着资产阶级的政党。南斯拉夫领导者固执地不愿承认自己立场的错误，认为南共不能有和似乎不应有自己的特别政纲，而应以人民阵线的政纲为满足。在南斯拉夫政治舞台上活动的只是人民阵线，而共产党及其组织不是以自己的名义在人民面前公开活动，这一事实不仅降低着党在国内政治生活上的作用，而且使党丧失其成为独立的政治力量。党的使命，在于经过公开的政治活动，经过公开宣传自己的观点和自己的政纲，日益取得人民更大的信任，并更加扩大自己对广大劳动群众的影响。南共领导者重复着俄国孟什维主义者的主张，即马克思主义党溶化于非党群众组织中的错误。这一切证明着在南斯拉夫的共产党内存在着取消派的倾向。\n    情报局认为这种政策危害到南共本身的生存，而结果包含一种使南斯拉夫人民共和国蜕化的危险。\n    　　五、\n    情报局认为南斯拉夫领导者制造成的党内的官僚主义制度是南共生存和发展的致命危险。党内没有民主，没有选举，没有批评与自我批评。与铁托同志和卡德尔同志之声明相反，南斯拉夫共产党中央的多数委员不是选举的，而是推荐的，共产党实际上处于半合法的地位。党不召集党的会议或者是采取秘密方式召集，这不能不损害党在群众中的影响。南共的这种组织形式，只能称之为宗派主义式的官僚主义式的形式。这种形式走向消灭党之成为一个积极的独立的组织，在党内养成军事领导的方法，就象从前托洛茨基所用的领导方法一样。\n    在南共党内，党员之最起码的权利都被剥夺了，对党内不正确的事情稍加批评，即遭受到残酷的镇压。这种现象是令人完全不能容忍的。情报局认为：南共中央委员尤约维奇和海德朗两同志，因为敢于批评南共领导者的反苏立场，和主张南斯拉夫与苏联友好，而被开除党籍并被逮捕的事实，是可耻的。（⑴⑵）\n    情报局认为在共产党内决不允准这种可耻的、土耳其式的恐怖制度。南共本身存在和发展的利益，要求消灭此种制度。\n    　　六、\n    情报局认为：联共中央及其他各国共产党中央对南共中央所犯错误之批评，乃是一种兄弟的帮助，这些批评给予南共领导机关造成一切必要条件，以便最迅速地改正他们所犯的错误。但是，染上了极端高傲、自满、目空一切等毛病的南共领导者，不去诚恳地接受这些批评，不去布尔塞维克式地改正所犯的错误，却以对批评兵刃相加的敌视态度，走上了一概否认自己错误的反党道路，破坏了马列主义关于政党对待自己错误态度的学说，因此更加重了自己的反党的错误。\n    南共领导者，在联共中央及其他兄弟共产党中央方面的批评面前，表示了自己的破产之后，即开始直接欺骗自己的党和人民，把这种对南共中央不正确政策的批评向党隐瞒，并且对党和人民掩盖惩罚尤约维奇及德朗两同志之真实原因。\n    最近以来，在联共中央以及其他各兄弟党方面对南共领导者进行了批评之后，南共领导者乃图宣布一系列新的左的措施。南共领导者慌忙颁布了关于小工商业国有化的新决议，这一决议之施行是毫无准备的，并由于这种匆忙的原因，这一决议的施行只能使南国人民的生计发生困难。他们慌忙颁布了征收农民粮食税的新法案，这一法案也是无准备的，因此新法案也只能使城市居民的粮食供给发生混乱。最后南共领导者在不久前宣布自己对苏联的爱戴和忠实，虽然谁都知道他们至今还在实行对苏联的不友好政策。\n    但不仅如此，最近期间南共领导者十分自信地宣布在南斯拉夫铲除资本主义成份的政策。在铁托和卡德尔于今年四月十三日致联共中央的信中写道：“中央扩大会议同意了中央政治局所提出之在国内肃清资本主义残余的方案”。\n    按照这一观点，四月二十五日卡德尔在南斯拉夫人民共和国联邦国民议会上的演辞中宣称：“人剥削人的一切残余，在我国存留的时间已屈指可数了。”\n    南共领导者之在南斯拉夫现存条件下消灭资本主义成份，也就是消灭富农阶级的观点只能是冒险的，非马克思主义的，而绝不能是别的东西。因为，当不可避免地产生资本主义的个体农民经济在国内占着优势，当农村经济大规模集体化的条件尚未具备，当多数劳动人民还未相信农业经营的集体方法的优越性时，是绝不能解决这一任务的。联共的经验证明：只有在农村经济大规模集体化的基础上，消灭最后的数目最多的剥削阶级——富农阶级，才有可能；而消灭富农之为阶级，乃是农村经济集体化的有机的构成部分。\n    为了顺利进行消灭富农之为阶级，因而消灭农村中的资本主义成份，要求党进行初步的长期的准备工作来限制农村中的资本主义成份，巩固在工人阶级领导下的工人阶级与农民的联盟，发展能够组织集体经营农业的机器生产的社会主义大工业，在这一工作中的急性病只能带来不可挽救的损害。\n    只有在周密准备及彻底实行这些措施的基础上，由限制农村中的资本主义因素而转到消灭它们，那才是可能的。\n    南斯拉夫的领导者以慌张手段和官府法令来解决此一任务的一切企图，只是早已注定了的失败的冒险，只是自傲和空洞的煽惑人民的宣言而已。\n    情报局认为：南共领导者想以类似的虚伪和煽惑的策略，来表示他们不仅站在阶级斗争的立场上，而且大大超出了那些由现实可能性观点来看南共在限制资本主义方面所能作到的那些要求。\n    情报局认为：南斯拉夫的领导者的所有这些法令和宣言，都是煽动民心的，和目前不能实现的，它们只能污辱南斯拉夫社会主义建设的旗帜。\n    所以情报局认为这些冒险政策乃是卑鄙的手腕，和不能允许的政治赌博。\n    显然，上述南斯拉夫领导者的左倾的煽惑的措施和宣言，乃是企图掩盖其拒绝承认错误和掩盖其拒绝诚恳改正自己的错误的。\n    　　七、\n    估计到南共党内造成的情况，和为给南共领导者以出路起见，联共中央和其他兄弟党中央曾提议根据在第一次情报局会议上审查其他共产党活动的一般的党的原则，同样来审查南共状况的问题。可是南共领导者对其他兄弟党在情报局上讨论南共状况问题的数次提议，均加以拒绝。为了逃避在情报局会议上兄弟党的正当批评，南共领导者杜撰出似乎他们是“处于不平等地位”的说法。应该指出：这种说法完全不是事实。大家都知道，在组织情报局的时候，共产党正是由这样的一个原则出发的，即任何一个党应该向情报局报告工作，同样任何一个党有权批评其他的党。在九国共产党第一次会议上，南共曾广泛地使用了批评其他的党的权利。但是南共领导者却拒绝向情报局报告工作，拒绝倾听其他共产党的批评意见。这就是说明南共领导者真正破坏了各国共产党平等的原则，这就等于要求给南共在情报局里建立特殊的地位。\n    　　八、\n    估计到上述一切事实，情报局赞同联共（布）中央对南共状况的估计，对南共中央错误的批评，以及联共（布）中央于一九四八年三月至五月致南共中央信中对这些错误的政治分析。\n    情报局一致得出结论：认为南共领导者之反马列主义的、反党的、反苏的观点，其一切行为，以及其拒绝出席情报局会议，这就是使自己与参加情报局的各国共产党对立起来，走上了分裂统一的反帝国主义的社会主义阵线的道路，走上了叛变劳动者的国际团结事业及转向民族主义立场的道路。\n    情报局斥责南共中央的这种反党的政策和行动。\n    情报局认为：这样，南共中央便使自己及南共处于自己兄弟党的大家庭之外，处于统一的共产主义阵线之外，因此处于情报局队伍之外。\n    情报局认为南共领导机关这些错误的根源，乃是一种无可怀疑的事实，即：在南共领导机关里，于最近五、六个月以来，那些以前曾隐藏着的民族主义分子又公开地取得了优势，而使南共的领导机关脱离了南共国际主义的传统，走向了民族主义的道路。\n    南共领导者过高估计了南斯拉夫内部的民族力量及潜在能力。他们以为没有全世界共产党的支援，没有人民民主国家的支援，没有苏联的支援，就可以保持得住南斯拉夫的独立，就可以建成社会主义。他们以为没有革命力量的援助，新南斯拉夫也可以生存下去。\n    南共的领导人不了解国际情况及帝国主义者们的吓诈威胁的技俩，以为向帝国主义国家作某些让步，他们就可以博得这些国家的欢心，就可以与这些国家谈好保持南国的独立，这样便逐渐促使南斯拉夫各民族倾向于帝国主义国家，也就是说倾向于资本主义。在这一点上，南共的领导者显然是由著名的资产阶级民族主义的纲领出发的，即认为：“资本主义国家对南斯拉夫的危险，比苏联对南斯拉夫的危险还要少一些”。\n    南共领导者显然是不了解，也可能是假装不了解，这种民族主义的立场，可能使南斯拉夫蜕化为一般的资产阶级的共和国，丧失南斯拉夫的独立，变南斯拉夫为帝国主义国家的殖民地。\n    情报局并不怀疑在南共内部是具有忠实于马列主义的，忠实于南共国际主义传统的，忠实于统一的社会主义阵线的充分的力量的。\n    南共这些健全的力量的任务，就是要强迫今天的领导者公开地诚恳地承认自己的错误，改正这些错误。脱离民族主义，回到国际主义方面来，并以一切办法巩固统一的反帝国主义的社会主义阵线；或者，如果南共现在的领导者表现得没有这种能力，那就换掉他们，并推选新的南共国际主义的领导机关。\n    情报局不怀疑南斯拉夫共产党是能够完成这一光荣的任务的。"

The masses, upon receiving the wage rice, were in high spirits. Women also actively participated. According to statistics, the masses in the sixteen villages contributed a total of 18,690 workdays, dredging 4,362 zhang of the Zhulong River channel, protecting 5,000 mu of crops on both banks, no longer fearing flooding from the river.

    "content": "[Frontline News] The Machine Gun Squad of the Fifth Company of the Australian Unit has made significant progress through the Four-Comparison (comparing bravery, comparing skills, comparing discipline, comparing hardship) movement. Since advancing into Chahar South, in the past three months, the squad has been supplemented with three new soldiers and three liberated soldiers, and has participated in three battles without any desertions or casualties. The squad leader, Zhang Shazi (Zhang the Fool), used to have serious remnants of warlordism; he would glare when he spoke, and the soldiers in the squad never dared to offer opinions. The deputy squad leader, Geng Gouba, was consistently lax and indifferent to the problems in the squad. When the Four-Comparison movement was launched, everyone offered them many opinions, and the squad leader and deputy squad leader immediately resolved to overcome their past shortcomings. At the same time, everyone also conducted a deep self-examination and resolved to correct their shortcomings. They found comparison targets for each other and handed the comparison conditions to the squad leader for safekeeping. When problems arose, the squad would raise them for examination of their resolve. After the Four-Comparison, Squad Leader Zhang never lost his temper and always led by example. In one battle, the liberated soldier Sun Caixiao's clothes were soaked by the rain, and Zhang Shazi exchanged his own clothes and bedding for him, moving Sun to the point of speechlessness. In the later stages of the march, Zhang also carried seven shells for the small artillery group in addition to his machine gun. Deputy Squad Leader Geng Gouba's feet were blistered and ulcerated, but he did not fall behind, influencing soldier Zhang Lengxiao to persevere as well. Problems that the squad could solve on its own were resolved in squad meetings. Once, when the soldiers were too tired during a march, soldier Zhang Jinfu cursed in the street. After arriving at the encampment, the squad leader conducted kind criticism at the squad meeting, and after the meeting, he solicited opinions from the soldiers on whether he had any problems in his attitude. The liberated soldier Zhang Lengxiao thought about escaping after entering Chahar South, but with the active help and patient education of the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and the entire squad, he has transformed into an activist. Currently, five people in the squad have been credited with minor merits.

    "content": "The Truth About US Imperialism Supporting Japan (Continued One)\n  　　　　　8. Delaying the Peace Treaty with Japan; Secret US-Japan Treaty Agreement\n    Last October, the American \"World Report\" weekly published a memorandum from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the peace treaty with Japan. Its main points were: (1) Japan requests to attend the peace conference to conclude a \"negotiated peace treaty,\" rather than a peace treaty based on unconditional surrender. (2) After the peace treaty is signed, the supervision by the Allied powers should be limited to the ambassadors of the four major powers, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, and should be conducted through diplomatic means, without directly interfering in Japanese politics. (3) Japan should retain the Kuril Islands; at least the southern Kuril Islands and the Habomai Islands, which are assigned to the Soviet Union, must remain Japanese territory. The Ryukyu Islands, southwestern Pacific islands, the Ogasawara Islands, and the islands near the Japanese mainland should, as far as possible, not be ceded and should belong to Japan. However, if certain Allied countries actively request these islands for military purposes, they can be leased for a certain period, but compensation must be paid. (4) Except for military factories, Japanese production should not be restricted. (5) Japanese foreign trade should not be subject to any restrictions. (6) Japan should retain 4 million tons of merchant ships and should possess aircraft. (7) Japan should have more armed police. (8) Japanese assets in neutral countries should not be used as reparations. (9) Japan will not compensate for losses suffered by the Allied powers in Japanese-occupied areas and Japan's occupation costs.\n    According to a TASS report from Rome on March 1 this year, the Roman newspaper \"La Repubblica\" revealed a secret agreement between the United States and Japan regarding the peace treaty. The newspaper pointed out that, according to the agreement reached by the US and Japanese representatives, after the peace treaty comes into effect, the Japanese government will (1) first lease the Ryukyu Islands and Tsushima Island to the United States for a period of 66 years, and allow the United States to establish land and naval bases in Kyushu and Hokkaido, Japan. (2) The United States has investment privileges in Japan's major and secondary industries. (3) Japan abandons its property in Latin America and transfers it to the United States. In return, the United States will support Japan's following proposals in the peace conference: (1) Maintain Japan's existing industrial equipment and allow it to be expanded subsequently. (2) Allow the import of raw materials needed by Japanese industry. (3) Abolish any restrictions on Japanese industry and its foreign trade. (4) Exempt reparations from Japan's foreign assets in neutral countries and current industrial production. (5) Japan has the right to postpone payment of goods to China. (6) Exempt Japan from compensation for Allied assets in Japanese-occupied areas and compensation for occupation costs in these areas. On the recommendation of MacArthur's headquarters, Japan has submitted its counter-proposal for the peace treaty (referring to the aforementioned secret memorandum) to observe the reaction of the Allied powers. In addition to this, the Japanese government has also submitted other proposals to MacArthur's headquarters regarding the military, industry, war potential, merchant ships, and part of the navy. The United States has already approved the above additional proposals.\n    　　　　The conspiracy to achieve long-term occupation by delaying the peace treaty\n    On the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, the United States violated the provision that the foreign ministers' conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom should first discuss the peace treaty. On July 11 last year, without the consent of the three major powers, China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, the United States unilaterally sent a note to the other ten countries in the Far East, inviting them to participate in the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, and arbitrarily advocated the method of voting by a two-thirds majority to abolish the principle of unanimous agreement of the four powers. The United States insists on this unreasonable proposition, its purpose is to \"deliberately obstruct the holding of a peace conference\" in order to \"handle Japan alone, and after all its plans are completed, convene a peace conference, at which time the United States can put forward Japan's situation as a fait accompli.\" (United Press, Washington, May 23)\n    According to a United Press report from Washington on May 30, US Undersecretary of State Lovett told Dening, Assistant Undersecretary of the British Foreign Office in charge of Far Eastern affairs, that \"the United States does not intend to take the initiative to try to open the deadlock between China, the Soviet Union, and the British United Nations regarding the procedures for convening the Japanese Peace Conference.\" The United States' refusal to initiate the opening of the deadlock in the Japanese Peace Conference has made Britain quite apprehensive. Denning's talks with Lovett and others have so far led to the belief that there is little possibility of convening the Japanese Peace Conference in the foreseeable future.\n    On June 14, the Central News Agency rebroadcast a United Press message from Washington, saying that \"official beliefs here about the expectation of concluding a peace treaty with Japan have changed, and this issue has been shelved.\"\n    Even the Chiang Kai-shek's Central Daily News revealed the US's purpose in delaying the peace treaty on May 14. On that day, it published an article entitled \"How the United States Supports Japan.\" This article was translated and compiled based on materials from the American \"Newsweek\" and \"World Report Weekly.\" After listing various facts about the US's support for Japan, the translator wrote under the subheading \"The situation of delay is extremely beneficial to Japan\": \"The convening of the peace conference with Japan is still far away. The United States is not in a hurry to sign a peace treaty with Japan and give up the power it is currently exercising in Japan. On the contrary, it hopes to maintain the current informal state of peace in order to 'transform' Japan into a reliable ally in troubled Asia.\"\n    On January 21 this year, Xinhua News Agency exposed the US's conspiracy to occupy Japan for a long time. Xinhua News Agency reported:\n    Shanghai News: In November last year, MacArthur's headquarters and Japanese government officials successively announced a \"shocking news,\" saying that there was a \"secret government\" in Japan, and that the US occupying forces and its so-called \"Japan reform plan\" were being \"severely threatened\" by the \"extensive underground movement\" of this so-called \"secret government.\" The real intention of MacArthur's trick is to deliberately create a chaotic situation and a tense atmosphere, so as to prove that the US imperialists must occupy Japan indefinitely. This point has now been exposed by commentators in Shanghai. According to the news of the so-called Japanese \"secret government,\" it was officially reported by MacArthur's headquarters in November last year. Colonel Cadwell, deputy director of the US military government, declared in a statement: The current basic political struggle is being carried out \"between the supremacy of law and the secret rule of gangsters, the latter is using people from all camps such as former diplomats, members of parliament, and industrialists.\" At the same time, the confidants of Japanese Prime Minister Katayama explained that these underground lurking elements were former army and navy officers who were unwilling to accept defeat, so they organized an underground government. The Japanese government spokesman explained that this fact was a \"natural product of the failure to restore economic stability after the war.\" In order to resist this situation, \"some Japanese leaders even advocated that the US occupying forces should not withdraw even after the peace treaty is signed.\"\n    Commentators in Shanghai believe that this remark by the Japanese spokesman, who was described by Reuters' Tokyo correspondent at the time as \"closest to Prime Minister Katayama,\" has completely revealed the conspiracy of the reactionary factions of the United States and Japan. The person pointed out that the entire conspiracy of the US imperialists is to occupy Japan for a long time as a base for aggression against the nations of the East. This conspiracy is not only manifested in the propaganda of the so-called Japanese \"secret government,\" but also in MacArthur's entire policy of deliberately creating a domestic political and economic crisis in Japan. The so-called Japanese army and navy officers, former diplomats, members of parliament, industrialists, etc., who are related to the secret government and accused of being used by gangsters, are not used by any gangsters, but are precisely used by MacArthur, the number one gangster. MacArthur not only indulges but also actively uses this group of war criminals, making them and his other group of lackeys, Katayama and others, play a puppet show of mutual fighting, so that the United States can extend the occupation period as much as possible in the chaos, which is no longer a secret.\n    The person further pointed out that MacArthur's strategy is consistent with MacArthur's suggestion to Marshall. MacArthur suggested that the time for the occupation of Japan must be extended, and for this reason, the signing of the peace treaty with Japan must be delayed under various pretexts. MacArthur believes that the United States must maintain US troops and US naval and air bases in Japan, China, and Korea, and even after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, the US military power should still be retained in order to completely consolidate the US position in the Far East. MacArthur also believes that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to continue to deepen the deterioration of Japan's political and economic situation and strengthen the propaganda of Japan's tense situation, so that public opinion feels that the US long-term occupation of Japan is forced and justified. Commentators in Shanghai especially remind the Chinese people to pay attention to the fact that MacArthur's conspiracy is now being actively carried out, and the US government's unreasonable behavior of deliberately canceling the four-power veto and convening the so-called eleven-nation conference to replace the four-nation conference on the peace conference with Japan, making the peace conference with Japan impossible to start, is completely in line with this conspiracy. The US policy of delaying the peace conference with Japan is obviously serving the same purpose as its policy of occupying Japan, that is, occupying Japan indefinitely to invade the nations of the East.\n\n　　　　　　　(To be continued)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝扶日真相（续一）\n\n1948-07-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝扶日真相（续一）\n  　　　　　八、拖延对日和约　美日秘密和约协议\n    去年十月美国“世界报导”周刊发表了日本外务省关于对日和约的备忘录，其要点为：（一）日本要求出席和会，以缔结一个“谈判的和约”，而非以无条件投降为基础的和约。（二）和约签字后，盟国的监督仅限于美、苏、英、中四强大使，并须以外交方式为之，不得直接干涉日本政治。（三）日本应保持千岛群岛，至少划归苏联之南千岛群岛及色列群岛必须仍属于日本；琉球、西南太平洋群岛、小笠原群岛及日本本土附近之岛屿，应尽量不使之割让而属于日本，但如若干盟国积极要求此等岛屿供作军事之用时，可以租借一定时期，但须付给报酬。（四）除军事工厂外，日本生产应不受限制。（五）日本对外贸易应不受任何限制。（六）日本应保有商船四百万吨，并应拥有飞机。（七）日本应有较多之武装警察。（八）日本在中立国之资产不得作为赔款。（九）日本不偿还盟国前在日占区所受之损失及日本之占领费。\n    又据塔斯社罗马今年三月一日电，罗马“共和报”曾揭露美日间关于和约之秘密协定。该报指出：按照美日代表所获之协议，日本政府于和约生效后（一）首先将琉球群岛及对马岛租与美国，为期六十六年，并准许美国在日本九州及北海道建立陆海军基地。（二）美国对日本主要工业及二等工业有投资特权。（三）日本放弃其在拉丁美洲之财产并转移于美国。而美国则允在和会中支持日本之下列建议：（一）保持日本现有之工业设备，并可随后加以扩张。（二）准许输入日本工业所需要之原料。（三）废弃对日本工业及其对外贸易之任何限制。（四）免除自日本在中立国之国外资产及现行工业生产中缴纳赔偿。（五）日本有权向中国延期缴纳商品。（六）免除日本对日占区盟国资产之赔偿及其对此等地区占领费之偿还。在麦克阿瑟总部建议之下，日本已提出其和约对案（即指前述秘密备忘录），以观盟国之反应。除此以外，日政府并曾向麦克阿瑟总部提出关于军队、工业、战争潜力、商船及部分海军之其他建议。美国业已批准上述附加建议。\n    　　　　用拖延和约来实现长期占领的阴谋\n    在对日和约问题上，美国破坏了由美苏中英四国外长会议首先讨论和约的规定。去年七月十一日，美国未经中英苏三强同意，擅自向远东其他十国发出照会，邀请他们参加对日和约的预备会，擅自主张以三分之二多数表决通过的办法，取消四强一致同意的原则。美国坚持这种无理的主张，其目的是“故意阻挠举行和会”，以便“单独处理日本，待其一切计划完成后，再召集和会，那时美国便可就日本之情形作为既成事实而提出了”。　　　　　　　（合众社华盛顿五月二十三日电）\n    据合众社华盛顿五月三十日电，美副国务卿罗维特曾告英外务部掌理远东事务之助理次官丹宁称：“美国不拟采取主动以求打开中苏及不列颠联合国之间对于召开日本和会程序问题所造成之僵局。”美国拒绝发动打开对日和会之僵局，使英国颇感惶惑。丹氏与罗维特及其他人士会谈，迄今认为在可见及之未来时期内，对日和会殊少召开之可能。\n    六月十四日中央社转播华盛顿合众社消息，谓“此间官方对期望订立对日和约所怀之信念已发生转变，此问题已告置诸高阁”。\n    即蒋党中央日报也于五月十四日泄露了美国拖延和约的目的。这天它刊载了题为“美国怎样扶植日本”的一篇文章，这篇文章是根据美国“新闻周刊”和“世界报告周刊”的材料移译而成的，该文译者列举了美国扶植日本的各种事实之后，在“拖的局面极有利于日本”的小标题下写道：“对日和会的召开仍遥遥无期。美国并不急于签订对日和约，放弃他现在日本行使的权力。相反地，她希维持目前的非正式和平状态，以便‘改造’日本成为她在多事的亚洲的可靠友邦”。\n    今年一月二十一日新华社就揭露过美国企图长期占领日本的阴谋，新华社报导说：\n    上海讯：去年十一月间，麦克阿瑟总部与日本政府官员曾先后宣布一项“惊人消息”，说日本存在着一个“秘密政府”，而美国占领军及其所谓“对日改革方案”则正受着这个所谓“秘密政府”的“广泛地下运动”的“严重威胁”。麦克阿瑟这个把戏的真实企图，乃是故意制造混乱的形势与紧张的空气，借以证明美国帝国主义者必须无限期地占领日本，此点现已为上海评论界人士所揭破。按所谓日本“秘密政府”的消息，系于去年十一月由麦克阿瑟总部正式报导，美国军政府副长官卡道上校于声明中宣称：目前的基本政治斗争是进行在“法律至上与匪徒的秘密统治之间，后者正利用过去的外交官、议会议员及工业家等各阵营人物”。同时，日本首相片山的亲信们则解释称：这些地下潜伏分子乃是过去的陆海军官，他们不愿接受战败，所以组织地下政府。日本政府发言人解释这个事实是“战争之后未恢复经济稳定前所有的自然产物”，为了抵抗这个情势，“若干日本领袖甚至主张签订和约后，美国占领军也不能撤退”。\n    上海评论界人士认为此一被路透社驻东京记者当时描写为“最为片山首相接近的”日本发言人的谈话，实已将美日两国反动派的阴谋和盘托出。该人士指出：美国帝国主义者的全部阴谋就是长期占领日本作为侵略东方各民族的基地，这个阴谋不仅表现于所谓日本“秘密政府”的宣传，并且表现于麦克阿瑟故意制造日本国内政治经济危机的全部政策。而所谓与秘密政府有关并被指为受匪徒利用的日本陆海军官，前外交官，议会议员，工业家等，并不是被任何旁的匪徒所利用，恰恰就是被麦克阿瑟这个头号匪徒所利用。麦克阿瑟不但放纵并且积极利用这批战犯，使他们与他的另一批走狗片山等人扮演互相混战的傀儡戏，以便美国在混乱之中尽量延长占领期，这早已不是秘密了。\n    该人士进一步指出：麦克阿瑟的这个策略，与外传麦氏对马歇尔的建议是相符合的。麦氏建议必须延长占领日本的时间，为此，并须在各种借口下拖延签订对日和约。麦氏认为美国在日本、中国和朝鲜必须保有美国军队与美国海空军基地，甚至即在签订对日和约以后仍应保留美国的军事力量，这样才能完全巩固美国在远东的地位。麦氏又认为：为达此项目的，就必须继续加深日本政治经济情况的恶化，并加强宣传日本紧张形势，使舆论觉得美国长期占领日本是被迫的和正当的。上海评论界人士特别提醒中国人民注意：麦克阿瑟的这一阴谋现正积极展开，而美国政府关于对日和会故意借取消四强否决权与召开所谓十一国会议以代替四国会议的无理取闹行动，使对日和会无从开起，正与这一阴谋完全合拍。美国关于拖延对日和会的政策，显然与其占领日本的政策服务于同一目的，即无限期占领日本以侵略东方各民族。　　　　　　　\n　　　　　　　（未完）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th.\n\n　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China\n    Resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Problem\n    (July 10, 1948)\n    (1) The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China fully agrees with the resolution passed by the Information Bureau Conference attended by the Communist Parties of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and Italy regarding the problem of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Holding this conference and passing this resolution is the duty that international communists must fulfill to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism, to defend the revolutionary cause of the working class and the people of all countries, and is the duty they must fulfill to defend the cause of world peace and democracy, and to protect the people of Yugoslavia from being fooled and invaded by American imperialism.\n    (2) The leading group of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, represented by Tito, Kardelj, Djilas, and Ranković, violated the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism in their treacherous and erroneous actions both domestically and externally, such as the principled distinction between socialist and capitalist countries, the necessity and importance of international assistance for revolutionary movements in various countries, the class struggle and the leading role of the proletariat in the people's revolutionary cause, the Party as the highest organizational form of the class, the Party's democratic centralism, the role of intra-Party criticism and self-criticism, etc., thereby falling into the quagmire of bourgeois nationalism and bourgeois political parties. Because the Tito group implemented anti-Marxist-Leninist domestic and foreign policies, because it adopted an anti-Soviet stance, suppressed intra-Party criticism, rejected the fraternal criticism of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other communist parties, refused to participate in the Information Bureau Conference, and continued to suppress correct opinions inside and outside the Yugoslav party and continued to be hostile to international communism after the publication of the Information Bureau Conference's resolution, it has seriously damaged the cause of the Yugoslav people and made the enemies of Yugoslavia cheer. The Communist Party of China warmly hopes that the internationalist elements within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia will resolutely rise up to correct the mistakes of the Tito group, so that the Communist Party of Yugoslavia can return to the path of Marxism-Leninism and the path of proletarian internationalism.\n    (3) The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the events that have occurred within the Yugoslav party are not accidental and isolated phenomena, but a reflection of the class struggle within the ranks of the proletarian revolution. As long as there are countries with classes, opportunists with bourgeois counter-revolutionary views will always attempt to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat, infiltrate the Communist Party, and attempt to use opportunities to undermine the revolutionary cause from within. This situation has occurred many times in the international communist movement; within the Communist Party of China, it has been manifested as Chen Duxiuism and Zhang Guotaoism. This situation requires communists to strive to raise their awareness and strengthen the education of Marxist-Leninist theory, in order to timely identify and oppose these bourgeois elements, protect the cause of the proletariat and the people from destruction and loss, and protect the ideological and political purity of the Communist Party. To this end, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that all party cadres should earnestly study the resolution of the Communist Information Bureau Conference on the problem of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, in order to strengthen the education within the party regarding class, the party, internationalism, the spirit of self-criticism, and discipline.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中央委员会  关于南共问题的决议\n\n1948-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中央委员会\n    关于南共问题的决议\n    （一九四八年七月十日）\n    （一）中国共产党中央委员会完全同意由保、罗、匈、波、苏、法、捷、意各国共产党所参加的情报局会议关于南斯拉夫共产党问题所通过的决议。举行这个会议并通过这个决议，乃是国际共产主义者为保卫马克思列宁主义的原则，保卫世界工人阶级和各国人民的革命事业，所应尽的职责；乃是他们为保卫世界和平民主事业，保卫南斯拉夫人民免受美帝国主义的愚弄和侵略，所应尽的职责。\n    （二）以铁托、卡德尔、德热拉斯、兰科维奇为代表的南斯拉夫共产党的领导集团，在其对内对外的背叛性的和错误的行动中，违反了马克思列宁主义的基本观点，例如社会主义国家与资本主义国家的原则区别，国际援助对于各国革命运动的必要性和重要性，阶级斗争和无产阶级对于人民革命事业的领导作用，党是阶级的最高组织形式，党的民主集中制，党内批评和自我批评的作用等，从而陷入资产阶级民族主义和资产阶级政党的泥坑。铁托集团因为它执行反马克思列宁主义的内外政策，因为它采取反苏立场，压制党内批评，拒绝苏联共产党和其他共产党的兄弟批评，拒绝参加情报局会议，并在情报局会议的决议公布以后，继续压制南斯拉夫党内外的正确意见，继续敌视国际共产主义，已经严重地损害了南斯拉夫的人民事业，并使南斯拉夫的敌人欢呼。中国共产党热烈希望南斯拉夫共产党内的国际主义分子能够坚决地起来纠正铁托集团的错误，使南斯拉夫共产党从新走上马克思列宁主义的轨道，走上无产阶级国际主义的轨道。\n    （三）中国共产党中央委员会认为：南斯拉夫党内所发生的事件，不是偶然的和孤立的现象，这是阶级斗争在无产阶级革命队伍中的反映。只要是阶级存在的国家，带着资产阶级反革命观点的投机分子，总是企图混入无产阶级的革命队伍，混入共产党，企图利用机会从内部来破坏革命事业。这种情况，曾经在国际共产主义运动中多次发生；在中国共产党内则曾经表现为陈独秀主义和张国焘主义。这种情况，要求共产党人努力提高觉悟，加强马克思列宁主义理论的教育，以便及时地识别和反对这些资产阶级分子，保卫无产阶级和人民的事业不受破坏和损失，保卫共产党在思想上和政治上的纯洁。为此目的，中国共产党中央委员会决定：全党干部都应当认真研究共产党情报局会议关于南斯拉夫共产党问题的决议，借以加强党内关于阶级的、党的、国际主义的、自我批评精神和纪律性的教育。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北十一日电】"

All seventeen coal mines owned by the Pittsburgh Coal Company have been closed, and coal production in all mines in western Pennsylvania has sharply decreased by 70 percent in the first day of the strike. The reason for the strike is that the capitalists demanded the cancellation of the provision in the contract that \"workers must join the union within a certain period of time after being hired,\" while the miners insisted on defending this right of the union, otherwise they would refuse to work.

    "title": "Another Large-Scale Treasonous and Criminal Transaction: Chiang and the U.S. Sign \"Bilateral Agreement\"; U.S. Imperialism Seizes Supervisory and Monopoly Power Over Chiang's Financial Economy",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-14",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 10th: Another large-scale treasonous and criminal transaction, involving the auctioning of China's sovereignty, has been completed between U.S. imperialism and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government. This transaction is the \"Bilateral Agreement\" signed in Nanjing on July 3rd by U.S. Ambassador Stuart and Wang Shijie on behalf of the U.S.-Chiang governments, regarding the so-called $275 million \"economic aid\" portion of the $400 million in U.S. \"aid\". For a mere $275 million, U.S. imperialists, through the hands of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, have seized supervisory and monopoly power over the financial economy of the Chiang-controlled areas and expanded extraterritorial rights. The U.S.-Chiang agreement includes the following criminal transactions:\n\tFirst, the United States has supreme supervisory and decision-making power over U.S. aid funds, materials, and \"Chinese currency\" (i.e., Chiang currency) equivalent to the value of the U.S. aid goods, thereby supervising and controlling the Chiang side's finances, currency, foreign exchange, trade, and industrial and agricultural production. The agreement stipulates that the Chiang government's \"various programs, plans, and measures formulated or adopted to implement the provisions of this agreement\" must be decided upon in \"consultation\" with the U.S. government; the Chiang government must report the usage of U.S. aid to the U.S. government every quarter; the Chiang government must establish a \"special account\" in the Central Bank and deposit into that \"account\" an amount of \"Chinese currency\" equal to the \"dollar expenses specified for goods, services, and technical information (including any expenses for processing, storage, transportation, repair, or other services performed as a result)\", as well as the net balance after the end of the \"relief\" funds allocated by the U.S. Congress last October. This currency \"may only be disposed of for purposes agreed upon with the government of the United States of America from time to time\", thereby controlling the Chiang side's \"construction programs or plans\", \"development\" of resources, and \"currency and finance\"; the \"exchange rate\" between Chinese currency and the U.S. dollar is to be \"agreed upon by the Chinese government and the government of the United States of America\" (a U.S. State Department spokesman admitted that this is \"a joint decision by China and the United States on the exchange rate\"); the \"prices\" at which U.S. aid goods are sold in the United States must also be \"agreed upon\" with the U.S. government; even the allocation and price controls of \"similar goods purchased and transported to China or produced locally with other funds\" are subject to U.S. supervision; the Chiang government must provide the U.S. government with \"information on China's economic situation\" and \"other relevant information required\" by the United States government on a regular basis.\n\tSecond, the United States monopolizes and plunders China's industrial and strategic resources with aggressive privileges. \"The Chinese government shall facilitate the transfer to the United States of America of materials produced in China which the United States of America requires because of lack or possible lack in its own resources, whether for storage or other purposes\"; the Chiang government must also provide the U.S. government with \"necessary information\" regarding these materials on a regular basis; in order to encourage the \"production activities\" and \"development of new resources\" of these materials, it is stipulated that Chinese currency under the \"special account\" can be used.\n\tThird, in order to further facilitate the large-scale dumping and blood-sucking of commodities from the United States and various U.S.-occupied areas, as well as South American countries controlled by U.S. capital, the agreement completely deprives China of its tariff sovereignty. The Chiang government \"undertakes to exert all practicable efforts to improve commercial relations with other countries\" and \"reduce public and private barriers to trade with other countries\". At the time of the signing of the agreement, a U.S. State Department spokesman blatantly stated: \"China must abolish commercial restrictions that American merchants in China are not satisfied with.\" In another U.S.-Chiang \"exchange of letters\" published simultaneously with the bilateral agreement, it was specifically stipulated that the Chiang government must grant West Germany and the U.S.-occupied area of Trieste \"most-favored-nation treatment\" in accordance with the Havana \"International Tariff and Trade Agreement\". Although the U.S. proposed during the negotiations that the Chiang government should also grant Japan and South Korea \"most-favored-nation treatment\", it was not explicitly included in the agreement. However, according to a Central News Agency report from Washington on the 3rd, a U.S. State Department spokesman has clearly announced: \"China allows the U.S.-occupied areas and Uruguay to receive most-favored-nation treatment,\" and China's \"abolition of commercial restrictions\" on the U.S. \"also applies\" to other countries that have commercial relations with China. From this, it seems that a secret resolution has been reached between the U.S. and Chiang on this matter.\n\tFourth, the scope of the U.S. extraterritorial rights in China is further expanded, and China's judicial administration or any other measures are made subservient to the interests of the Americans. The agreement stipulates that the special mission of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration stationed in China, which carries out direct supervision, and its staff members, shall be \"deemed to be a part of the Embassy of the United States of America in China and shall enjoy the same privileges and immunities (i.e., inviolability of person and property, tax exemption, and extraterritoriality, etc.) as are enjoyed by the Embassy and its equivalent staff members\"; the members and staff of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation of the U.S. Congress shall also enjoy \"corresponding courtesies\". There is no limit to the number of such American personnel directly engaged in the invasion of China in the agreement. In addition, it is further stipulated that if any future \"measures\" by the Chinese side affect the \"property or interests\" of the American \"people\", the Americans have the right to submit them to the \"International Court of Justice\" (established in The Hague, Netherlands in 1922 in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations, now under the United Nations, but actually controlled by the United States) or \"any arbitral tribunal agreed upon by both parties (the 'China-U.S. Commercial Arbitration Association', which infringes upon China's judicial sovereignty and serves the interests of American merchants in China, is being actively prepared for establishment)\" for adjudication or resolution.\n\tThe \"Bilateral Agreement\" is valid until June 30, 1950, and the \"exchange of letters\" is valid until January 1, 1951, both of which far exceed the one-year term of U.S. aid to Chiang. The above facts fully prove that this is an aggressive treaty by U.S. imperialists attempting to enslave China economically for a long time.\n\tSince Bei Zuyi went to the United States in January this year to conduct \"U.S. Aid\" negotiations, the Chinese sovereignty expended by the Chiang bandit gang in order to obtain assistance from its American master far exceeds the contents stipulated in the agreement. Chiang Kai-shek has sold China's inland navigation rights, tariff sovereignty, and all industrial, mining, transportation, and port sovereignty in South China to U.S. imperialism. The United States has also acquired increasingly more rights in training the Chiang army and controlling the Chiang navy and air force, as well as the right to arbitrarily send American \"advisers\" to any department of the Chiang government.\n\tIn addition, negotiations on the establishment of the \"China-U.S. Rural Reconstruction Commission\" to comprehensively control China's agriculture, and negotiations on the 125 million so-called \"military aid\" portion, are also underway.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 又一项大规模卖国罪恶交易　蒋美签订“双边协定”  美帝攫取了蒋区财政经济监督垄断权\n\n1948-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　又一项大规模卖国罪恶交易\n    蒋美签订“双边协定”\n    美帝攫取了蒋区财政经济监督垄断权\n    【新华社陕北十日电】美帝国主义与卖国贼蒋介石政府之间又完成了一项大规模拍卖中国主权的罪恶交易。这项买卖，即是七月三日在南京山司徒雷登与王世杰代表美蒋政府签订了的，关于美“援”四亿美元中所谓二亿七千五百万美元的“经济援助”部分的“双边协定”。美帝国主义者以区区二亿七千五百万美元的代价，经卖国贼蒋介石之手攫取了蒋管区财政经济的监督垄断权，扩大了治外法权。美蒋协定包括下列各项罪恶买卖条款：第一、美国对于美援款项、物资以及与该项美援货物价值相等之“中国货币”（即蒋币）有最高监督权和决定权，并借以监督和控制蒋方财政、金融、外汇、贸易以及工农业生产。协定规定蒋政府“为实施本协定之规定所拟定或采取之各项方案、计划及措施”须与美政府“协商”决定之；蒋政府须将美援运用情形每季向美政府报告一次；蒋政府须在中央银行立一“特别帐户”，将等于美援“货物、服务及技术情报（包括加工、储藏、运输、修理或因此所为其他服务之任何费用）所指明之美元费用同等数额”之“中国货币”、以及去年十月美国会所拨“救济”款项结束后之纯净结余存入该“帐户”内，该项货币“仅得依其与美利坚合众国政府随时商定之目的予以处置”，借以控制蒋方“建设方案或计划”、资源之“开发”和“币制及财政”；中国货币与美元之“折合率由中国政府与美利坚合众国政府商定之”（美国务院发言人承认这就是“中美双方共同决定外汇率”）；美援货物在美出售之“价格”亦须与美政府“商定”之；甚至对“以其他款项购运中国或当地生产之类似货物”的分配和物价管制，美国亦有参与监督之权利；蒋政府须将“关于中国经济状况之情报”以及美国“所需要之其他有关情报”按时提供美国政府。第二、美国垄断和掠夺中国工业和战略资源的侵略特权。“中国政府对美利坚合众国因其本国资源中缺乏或可能缺乏而需要之中国所产物资移转于美利坚合众国，无论系为储蓄或其他目的，将予以便利”；蒋政府并须按时向美政府提供关于此项物资“所必要之情报”；为鼓励此项物资之“生产活动”及“开发新富源”，规定可动用“特别帐户”下之中国货币。第三、为更便于美国和各美占领区，以及美国资本控制下之南美各国商品大规模来华倾销吸血，协定完全剥夺了中国的关税主权。蒋政府“承允从事一切可行之努力以改善与他国间之商务关系”，“减少与他国间贸易之公私障碍”。协定签订时，美国务院发言人更露骨声称：“在华美商人所不满意之商务限制，中国须予废止”。与双边协定同时发表之另一蒋美“换文”中，特别规定蒋政府须按照哈瓦那“国际关税及贸易协定”给西德和的里雅斯特尔美占区以“最惠国待遇”。美国在谈判中提出之蒋政府对日本及南韩亦须给以“最惠国待遇”一点，虽未明白列入条文中，但据中央社华盛顿三日讯：美国务院发言人已明白宣布：“中国允许予美各占区及乌拉圭以最惠国待遇”，中国对美“商务限制之废止”“亦适用”于与中国有商务关系之其他国家。由此看来，美蒋之间对此似已秘密解决。第四、将美国人在华所享“治外法权”的侵华特权范围更予扩大，并使中国司法行政或任何其他措施都服从于美国人的利益。协定规定驻华执行直接监督的美国经济合作局特别代表团及所属职员须“视为美利坚合众国驻中国大使馆之一部分，俾得享受该大使馆及其同等职员所享受之优例及豁免（按即身体财产不可侵权，免税权及治外法权等）”；美国国会对外经济合作联合委员会之委员及职员，亦享受“相当的礼遇”。而此类直接从事侵略中国的美国人员，协定中并无人数限制。此外，更规定中国方面今后任何“措施”影响美国“人民”之“财产或利益”时，美人有权提交“国际法院”（一九二二年依据国际联盟规约成立于荷兰海牙，现转属联合国，实际上由美国控制）或“经双方相互约定之任何公断法庭（按侵害中国司法主权的服务于在华美国商人利益的‘中美商务公断会’正积极筹建中）裁判或解决”。\n    “双边协定”所规定之有效时间为至一九五○年六月三十日止，“换文”之有效时间则系至一九五一年一月一为止，皆远超过美国对蒋援助之一年期限。根据上述事实充分证明：这是美帝国主义者企图在经济上长期奴役中国的一个侵略条约。\n    按自今年一月贝祖诒赴美进行“美援”谈判以来，蒋匪帮为了获得美国主子的援助，所支出的中国主权，已远不止于该协定所规定的内容。蒋介石已将中国的内河航行权、关税主权、和华南全部工矿、交通、港口主权出卖给了美帝国主义。美国并已在训练蒋军和控制蒋记海、空军方面取得了日益增多的权利，以及向蒋政府任何部门任意派遣美国“顾问”的权利。\n    此外，关于设立用以全面控制中国农业的“中美农村复兴委员会”的谈判，和关于一亿二千五百万所谓“军事援助”部分的谈判，亦在进行中。"

    "content": "[Chahar News] In Wanquan, Huailai, Fangshan, Liangxiang and other places in the third special district of Beiyue, many dependents of military personnel, workers, and revolutionary martyrs have organized themselves to participate in production, reducing the burden of labor on the masses. Han Jingzhen's work exchange group in Yanjia Terrace, Wanquan First District, consists of sixteen people, only three of whom are not dependents of military personnel or workers. They organized in February, carrying coal and manure themselves. During the spring plowing and sowing season, they plowed fifteen acres of land. They have a total of ninety-six acres of land, ninety percent of which they cultivate themselves. In previous years, each household used no less than twenty preferential labor days; this year, only a few households used a few woodcutters. After the military, worker, and martyr dependents in Jinjitai Village, Fourth District, participated in production, they saved a total of one thousand substitute labor days. The six military dependents' households in Zhangjia Village, who were most lacking in labor, organized a work exchange group led by Liang Shirun. Starting from the twenty-sixth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, they collected manure, sending all six hundred baskets of manure to the fields. From spring plowing to weeding, they only used five male laborers to help and planted all the land and completed weeding. Liang Shirun herself also planted one hundred and twenty catties of yam and two catties of cloud beans (seeds). She said, \"As long as we work hard and produce more, we won't go hungry ourselves, and it will save the village from taking care of us.\" After reviewing the shortcomings of some people being irresponsible when providing preferential labor and some military, worker, and martyr dependents being able to produce but not doing so, simply relying on preferential treatment, Luyepo Village in the Second District of Huailai determined that in the future, preferential labor days would be recorded according to work done, and it must be guaranteed that the work is done well. At the same time, they educated and persuaded military, worker, and martyr dependents to actively participate in production. They organized work exchange groups based on the spirit of voluntarism; the village was responsible for helping the seven households that were truly lacking in labor. The entire village of forty-four military, worker, and martyr households used an average of more than four hundred preferential labor days each year in the past. This year, after rectification and organization, they only used eighteen livestock labor days and more than twenty human labor days to plant the land well. The originally decided substitute farming households also tried their best to participate in production. Su Congzhen, who is already sixty-four years old this year, also voluntarily asked to join the work exchange group; Zhang Guimei and Du Wenyuan both brought their children and organized together to carry out production, weeding the land and collecting firewood. One military dependent household, which used to use fifty or sixty preferential labor days every year, only used a few labor days this year under everyone's influence. Qianshimen Village in the Second District of Fangshan has a total of ten military, worker, and martyr households, including four households with seventeen people, without any full labor force. The village originally planned to help them with seventy labor days throughout the year, but with their active participation in labor, from the beginning of spring to the first weeding, they only used twelve labor days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平西军工烈属积极参加生产\n\n1948-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平西军工烈属积极参加生产\n    【察哈尔讯】北岳三专区宛平、怀来、房山、良乡等地，不少军、工、烈属组织起来参加生产，减轻群众劳力负担。宛平一区燕家台妇女韩景珍的拨工组，共十六个人，只有三个人不是军、工属。她们从二月组织起来，自己背煤、背粪，在春耕播种时期曾拉犁耕地十五亩。她们共有土地九十六亩，百分之九十都是自己耕种的。往年她们每户所用的优待工都不下二十个，今年只个别户用了几个打柴工。四区金鸡台村的军、工、烈属参加生产以后，共节省了一千个代耕工。张家村六户最缺劳力的军属在梁士润带领下，组织了一个拨工组，由正月二十六开始搞粪，把六家的六百多篓粪全送到地里，从春耕到锄苗，她们只用了五个男工帮助，就把所有的土地全种上了，锄完了苗。梁士润本人还单独种了一百二十斤山药二斤云豆（种），她说：“只要好好劳动，多生产，自己挨不了饿，也省的让村中照顾。”怀来二区鹿业坡村检讨了以前有些人出优待工时不负责任，及某些军、工、烈属能生产而不生产，单纯依靠优待等缺点后，即确定了今后出优待工时按活记工，一定保证把活作好，同时教育说服军、工、烈属积极生产。她们根据自愿精神组织了拨工组；七户实在缺乏劳动力的，由村中负责帮助。全村四十四户军、工、烈属，过去每年平均用优待工四百多个，今年经过整顿组织，只用十八个牲口工和二十多个人工就把地种好了。原来决定的代耕户也都尽力参加生产，苏从真今年已经六十四岁了，也自动要求参加拨工组；张桂梅、杜文苑二人都带着小孩，也组织到一起进行生产，锄了地还拾了柴。过去每年都得用优待工五、六十个的一户军属，在大家的影响下，今年只用了几个工。房山二区前石门村共有十户军、工、烈属，其中有四户十七口人，没有整劳动力，村中原计划全年帮他们七十个工，但在他们积极参加劳动之下，从开春到锄头遍，只用了十二个工。"

The meeting, chaired by Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, announced that this commemorative meeting was also a study mobilization rally, calling on all Party members and cadres to intensify their studies, master policies, resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's line, and welcome the victory of liberating the Great Northwest. Comrade Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Border Region Government, Comrade He Long, Commander of the Northwest Joint Defense Army, and Comrade Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Bureau, each gave important reports on studying Mao Zedong's thought methods, implementing the Central Committee's line and policies, and overcoming the serious state of anarchy and lack of discipline that still existed in various Party, government, and military departments in the Northwest.\n\n　　Chairman Lin, after briefly reporting on the history of the Party and its lessons, especially emphasized that some cadres in the Northwest still lacked the spirit of consciously abiding by discipline, criticism, and self-criticism. Some local cadres were unwilling to work in new areas; some outside cadres were not content to work in the border area; some technical cadres emphasized their own particularity and neglected political study; in supporting the front and war service and production and disaster relief work, there were serious compulsory orders and formalism and bureaucraticism; in land reform and rectification, some areas also showed insufficient speed and resolution in implementing policies. These are all manifestations of disobedience to discipline, failure to implement policies, impure Party spirit, and irresponsibility to the people. Chairman Lin called on all Party members and cadres to strictly examine themselves in future studies according to the spirit of the documents, learn as long as they live, and continuously improve themselves politically, ideologically, and culturally, to better serve the people. Chairman Lin further emphasized that the key to the success or failure of the future study movement lies in whether leading comrades at all levels earnestly study themselves and whether they regard leading study as an important task of their own work. Therefore, he called on leading comrades at all levels to truly lead by example and become good organizers and leaders of the entire study movement.\n\n　　Commander He, based on the spirit of the two documents, the \"Preface to the Second Chapter of 'Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disorder' Reprinted\" and the \"Notice on Commemorating 'July 1st' and 'July 7th'\" of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, reminded all Party members and cadres to review the following erroneous tendencies in this study: (1) localism of each doing things in his own way and acting as he pleases; (2) failure to carefully study and earnestly implement the Central Committee's lines and policies; (3) dealing with issues of principle and policy without authorization, without asking for instructions beforehand and without reporting afterwards; (4) lack of mass viewpoint, failure to reflect the real situation of the masses to the higher authorities, exaggeration of achievements, concealment of errors; (5) deciding whether to implement the instructions of higher authorities according to personal or unit preferences; (6) choosing jobs not according to the needs of the Party but according to their own interests, and working passively in jobs they dislike; (7) work is sluggish and delayed, not abiding by the system, irresponsible, disregarding the overall situation, and not paying attention to efficiency; (8) liberalism, spreading gossip, not talking or talking little about work when meeting, but talking more about trivial matters of life. Commander He demanded that all Party members and cadres seriously treat their mistakes and launch a struggle against the lack of Party spirit and undisciplined phenomena. In order to achieve the unity of will, action, style, and discipline of the whole Party, establish centralized leadership, and strive to thoroughly implement the line and policies of the Party Central Committee.\n\n　　Comrade Ma Mingfang specifically analyzed the various undesirable ideological tendencies such as individualism, liberalism, and commandism that exist in some Party members and cadres, and demanded that they be thoroughly corrected in the study, so that all Party members and cadres can improve a step and welcome victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延安学习动员大会号召　加紧学习掌握政策\n\n1948-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延安学习动员大会号召\n    加紧学习掌握政策\n    【新华社西北十二日电】七月一日，中共西北中央局特于延安边府礼堂召开千余人的干部大会，纪念中国共产党诞生二十七周年。大会由西北局书记习仲勋同志主席，宣布此一纪念大会亦为学习动员大会，号召所有党员、干部加紧学习，掌握政策，坚决执行党中央的路线，迎接解放大西北的胜利。边府主席林伯渠同志、西北联防军司令员贺龙同志及西北局副书记马明芳同志，均就学习毛泽东思想方法、执行中央路线、政策，克服西北党政军各部门还存在着的某一严重的无政府无纪律状态，分别作重要报告。\n    林主席在简要报告党的历史及其教训后，特别强调指出西北某些干部至今还缺乏自觉遵守纪律、批评与自我批评的精神。有些本地干部不愿到新区工作；有些外来干部不安心在边区工作；有些技术干部强调本身的特殊性，忽视政治学习；在支前战勤及生产救灾工作中，存在着严重的强迫命令与形式主义、官僚主义的作风；在土改纠编中，某些地区也有执行政策不够迅速坚决的表现。这些都是不服从纪律、不执行政策、党性不纯、对人民不负责任的表现。林主席号召全体党员、干部，在今后学习中，根据文件的精神，严格检查自己，活到老，学到老，在政治上、思想上、文化上不断提高自己，更好地为人民服务。林主席更着重指出今后学习运动成败的关键，在于各级领导同志自己是否认真学习与是否把领导学习当作是自己工作的重要任务。因此他号召各级领导同志真正以身作则，并成为整个学习运动的好的组织者与领导者。\n    贺司令员根据中共中央宣传部“重印‘左派幼稚病’第二章前言”与“关于纪念‘七一’和‘七七’通知”两个文件的精神，提醒全体党员、干部要在这次学习中检讨下述各种错误倾向：（一）各自为政和各行其是的地方主义；（二）对中央的路线和政策，不细心研究和认真执行；（三）对待原则性、政策性的问题，擅自处理，事前不请示，事后不报告；（四）缺乏群众观点，不向上级反映群众的真实情况，夸大成绩，隐瞒错误；（五）对上级指示，按照个人或本单位的好恶，决定执行或不执行；（六）不根据党的需要而是根据自己的兴趣来选择工作岗位，对自己不喜欢的工作消极怠工；（七）工作疲塌拖延，不守制度，不负责任，不顾全局，不讲效率；（八）自由主义、小广播，见面不谈或少谈工作，对生活琐事却讲的多。贺司令员要求全体党员、干部严肃地对待自己的错误，与缺乏党性、没有纪律的现象展开斗争。以求达到全党意志、行动、作风和纪律的统一，树立集中领导，为彻底实现党中央的路线和政策而奋斗。\n    马明芳同志具体分析了某些党员、干部中存在着的个人主义、自由主义、命令主义等各种不良思想倾向，并要求在学习中彻底纠正，以使全体党员、干部提高一步，迎接胜利。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jinzhong, 11th.\n\n　　“Savior, you've come!”\n    “Wheat, wheat, grow slowly, wait for the life-saving troops to come before you turn yellow!” This folk song expresses the feelings of the people of Jinzhong, who feared that Yan's troops would steal their wheat and eagerly awaited the arrival of the People's Liberation Army to protect it. Now, our army has penetrated deep into Jinzhong to fight, and in every village we pass or are stationed in, groups of men, women, and children surround our soldiers, weeping and recounting the atrocities of Yan's bandits. When the masses of Changze Village in Pingyao stopped our army, they began by saying, \"Savior, you've come!\" and then choked up, unable to speak. An old woman hugged Wang Dingguo, the commander of a certain regiment of our army, and cried loudly, \"Child, I recognize you. You led troops here last year. You have finally come back!\" In a certain village, an old woman heard someone knocking on the door in the middle of the night and thought it was the \"Gouzi Army\" (as the people of Jinzhong called Yan's bandits), so she ignored it. The next day, when she opened the door, she saw PLA soldiers sleeping outside her door, and she couldn't help but burst into tears.\n\n    Since Yan's bandits reoccupied Wenxi, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, and Pingyao last spring, the local people have been subjected to slaughter and endless plunder, resulting in ruined families, separated wives and children, and abandoned fields. The once-rich Jinzhong plain has been transformed into a living hell.\n\n    Changze Village in Pingyao has 105 households, a population of over 680, and 3,400 mu of land. Last year, they only harvested 680 shi of various grains, equivalent to 1,326 shi of mixed grains. Who knew that these few grains would become the source of disaster? After the wheat harvest last year, Yan's bandits began to \"levy\" grain. In October, 50 villagers were forced to flee due to unbearable oppression. Yan's bandits burned down more than 40 houses of the fleeing households to threaten the farmers. Then, they came to \"levy\" grain again and again, beating, binding, and dispatching police teams to search every household, digging cellars, overturning chests and cabinets, and openly plundering. On one occasion, the bandits slammed a large guillotine on the table and said, \"Whoever doesn't hand over grain will see this!\" On another occasion, they stripped the clothes off the peasants who could not hand over the grain and froze them to death. From August of last year to March of this year, the village was forced to provide grain under dozens of names, including \"regular grain,\" \"provincial public grain,\" \"county public grain,\" \"military purchase grain,\" \"village grain,\" \"food ration grain,\" \"grain for comforting wounded soldiers,\" \"cooperative shareholding grain,\" \"militia training grain,\" \"construction project grain,\" as well as grain demanded privately by the puppet township chiefs and captains to redeem captured villagers, totaling 1,043.5 shi of coarse grain, accounting for six-fifths of the village's total annual harvest. This spring, the people of the village generally filled their stomachs with wild vegetables, bran, and tree bark. Farmers Zhao Juhai, Wen Ying, Wen Qinyuan, and others starved to death.\n\n    The people of Jinzhong not only went hungry but also suffered the massacre by Yan's bandits. Last winter, Yan's bandits gathered local despots and hooligans for \"three self-training\" (self-examination, self-defense, self-governance), requiring each person to \"suddenly report\" (meaning secretly report) three \"camouflage elements\" (a false accusation against those who opposed Yan's bandits' tyranny), and then arrested people on a large scale based on the list. On the evening of December 2nd, over 700 people were arrested in Pingyao County alone. On the 3rd, they were distributed to various villages and executed. In Xiang Le Town alone, more than 30 people were killed. At the same time, Yan's bandits launched a so-called \"self-confession and rebirth movement\" in various villages, forcing every villager to \"confess\" \"their relationship with the Eighth Route Army.\" Those who did not \"confess\" were not released. Yan's bandits used the following brutal and absurd scenes to intimidate the people: coffins and clubs were placed on the field, and slogans of \"beat to death with乱棍\" were posted everywhere. Everyone was required to cry and slap themselves in the face with their own hands. Yan's bandits asked, \"Have you been reborn?\" The answer had to be, \"I have been reborn.\" They asked, \"How old are you?\" The answer had to be, \"One year old.\" If the masses did not hit themselves or cry, Yan's bandits would grab them, put them in coffins, and beat them severely. Finally, they threatened the masses, saying that if they approached the Eighth Route Army again, they would be \"beaten to death with乱棍.\" In Taoyuan Fort, Pingyao, a widow was forced to \"confess\" that she had boiled water for the Liberation Army. Yan's bandits then forced her whole family to pronounce her guilty of death, then hanged her, and announced, \"This is what her family all agree she deserves!\"\n\n    Many masses who had been subjected to torture told these tragic stories while taking off their clothes to show the soldiers their scars, and the soldiers and civilians were filled with grief and indignation. The troops immediately composed a song: \"Yan's bandits kill without blinking an eye, self-confession and rebirth are cruel, on the small ground of Pingyao, seven hundred and three were killed in one night.\" The masses who heard it quietly shed tears. Inspired by the people's tragic experience, the soldiers wrote to their leaders one after another, requesting to be given the main attack task, to eliminate Yan's bandits as soon as possible, and to avenge the people of Jinzhong.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “救命恩人，你来啦！”\n\n1948-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“救命恩人，你来啦！”\n    “麦子，麦子，你慢慢长，救命的队伍来了你再黄!”这首歌谣，是晋中人民害怕阎匪抢麦，热盼解放军前往护麦的心情的流露。现在，我军已深入晋中作战，路过或驻宿每一个村庄，成群的男女老少都围住战士们哭诉阎匪暴行。平遥长则村群众拦住我军刚开口说：“救命恩人，你来啦！”以后便哽咽不能成声。一位老太太抱住我军某营长王定国同志号啕大哭的说：“孩儿，我认识你，你去年带队伍住过这里，你们到底回来啦！”某村一位老太太半夜听见有人叫门，以为是“勾子军”（晋中人民以此称呼阎匪），她不理睬；第二天开门一看，解放军战士睡在她的门外，她情不自禁地痛哭起来。\n    自去春阎匪再度侵踞文水、汾阳、孝义、平遥一带后，当地人民便在屠杀和无止境的掠夺下，家败人亡，妻离子散，田园荒芜，富足的晋中平川，变成了人间地狱。\n    平遥长则村有一百零五户，人口六百八十余，土地三千四百亩，去年只打了各种粮六百八十石，折合杂粮一千三百二十六石。谁知这几颗粮食竟成了祸根。去年麦收后，阎匪便开始“征”粮，十月间，五十户村民因不堪压榨被迫逃亡，阎匪竟将逃亡户的房子烧毁了四十多间，以此威胁农民。接着便一次又一次的来“征”粮吊打捆绑并派保警队挨户搜查，掘地窖，翻箱柜，进行公开的抢掠。有一次，匪徒们拿了一把大铡刀在桌上一拍说：“谁不交，就看这个！”另一次，则将交不出粮的老百姓剥光了衣服活活冻死。从去年八月到今年三月该村被迫出粮的名目有“正粮”、“省公粮”、“县公粮”、“军购粮”、“乡村粮”、“派饭粮”、“慰劳伤兵粮”、“合作社入股粮”、“民卫军整训粮”、“修工事粮”及伪乡长队长私人要粮和赎回被抓村民粮等几十种，折合粗粮一千零四十三石五斗，占该村农民全年收获物的六分之五。今春该村人民普遍以野菜、糠秕和树皮充饥，农民赵巨孩、温英、温钦元等都活活饿死。\n    晋中人民不仅挨饿，更惨遭阎匪的屠杀，去年冬季，阎匪集训恶霸流氓分子进行“三自传训”（自清、自卫、自治），要每人（突击）（密报之意）三个“伪装分子”（对反对阎匪暴政者的诬称），然后根据名单大肆捕人，十二月二日晚，平遥一县逮捕了七百多人，三日分发到各村处死，仅香乐镇殉难人民即达三十余人。与此同时，阎匪更在各村举行所谓“自白转生运动”，强迫每个村民“自白”“和八路军的关系”。不“自白”就不放回去。阎匪以下面这些残暴荒诞的场面来慑服人民：场上摆了棺材和棍棒，到处贴着“乱棍打死”的标语。要每个人哭着用自己的手打自己的耳光，阎匪问：“转生没有？”必须答：“转生了。”又问：“几岁了？”必答：“一岁了。”如果群众不打不哭，阎匪就抓过去放在棺材里痛打。最后并威胁群众说，以后再接近八路军，就“乱棍打死”。平遥桃园堡一个寡妇被迫“自白”了曾给解放军烧过开水，阎匪于是强迫她全家给她定为死罪，然后绞死；并宣传说：“这是她一家人公认该杀的！”\n    许多曾遭酷刑的群众一边诉说这些悲痛的故事，一面脱了衣服把伤痕给战士们看，军民悲愤交集。部队上当场就编了一首歌：“阎贼杀人不眨眼，自白转生闹得惨，平遥一块小地面，一夜杀了七百三”。听到的群众悄悄流下了眼泪。为人民的惨痛经历所激动的战士们纷纷上书首长，要求给予主攻任务，早日消灭阎匪，为晋中人民复仇。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社晋中十一日电】"

    "content": "[Hebei Central News] In the land reform in Hejian, more than half of the villages infringed upon the interests of some middle peasants to varying degrees, causing panic among other middle peasants and affecting their production morale. Since the end of March, when the county party committee convened a county-wide representative joint meeting, clarified the standards for class division, and implemented the policy of resolutely not infringing upon the interests of middle peasants, most villages have corrected or are in the process of correcting these errors.\n\nAccording to statistics, there were incidents of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants in a total of 160 villages, involving 656 households. Among them, 325 households had their class status raised because people wanted to seize their property; some were wrongly classified because the class determination was traced back too far (about 20 years) from the establishment of the democratic government; some were raised because of slight exploitation; and 98 households had their property seized due to confusion between political and economic factors. The circumstances and extent of the infringements also varied. The doors of 199 households were wrongly sealed, and most or part of their property was seized. 169 households had not their doors sealed, but were forced to hand over part of their property or land. 181 households had their doors sealed but no property seized. 107 households were detained. At the beginning of the land reform, the poor peasant leagues in many villages also seriously excluded middle peasants, such as restricting middle peasants' activities in buying and selling, and only allowing middle peasants to perform wartime service, which caused panic and dissatisfaction among middle peasants. Some middle peasants were afraid of being struggled against and gave gifts to the representatives of the poor peasant leagues. Some, fearing the seizure of their property, fortified their homes. Others ate and drank lavishly, thinking they were getting their money's worth. During the spring plowing season, some middle peasants did not cultivate the land or apply fertilizer, fearing that if they did, it would be distributed to others, expressing great doubt about our party's policy of uniting with middle peasants.\n\nThe main reasons for infringing upon the interests of middle peasants were: on the one hand, the standards for class division were not clear at the time, and some leading cadres had \"leftist\" ideas, or catered to the tailism of the masses, or held purely pro-poor peasant views; on the other hand, some poor peasants and farm laborers harbored the idea of \"getting a piece of the pie,\" and a few hooligans wanted to \"get rich by taking advantage of the situation,\" deliberately raising the class status of middle peasants; some poor peasant league organizations were impure and controlled by landlords and bad elements, diverting the focus of struggle and harming the interests of middle peasants.\n\nAt the county-wide representative joint meeting, the central government's documents on class division and class determination were first studied, and then the situation in each village was reviewed in light of the documents. After the county party committee's explanation and guidance, most people understood the ideology and discussed the methods for correction. After the meeting, various localities seized the opportunity to implement policies and correct deviations. In terms of correction methods, most villages clarified the standards for class determination through agricultural association (or poor peasant league) group meetings, re-discussing and reviewing wrongly determined class status; after the majority of the masses agreed, they corrected the wrongly determined class status, and returned all or part of the property according to the actual situation of the infringement. They convened meetings with wrongly struggled households to explain the reasons and explain that they should no longer harbor doubts and dissatisfaction. If some property could not actually be returned in full, they apologized to the wrongly struggled households, and if the person concerned agreed, it would not be returned; if not returning it would affect the wrongly struggled households' lives and production, they tried every means to return it. At present, 123 villages in the county have been corrected, and 480 households have been thoroughly corrected. However, some problems have also occurred in the correction of deviations. Some villages only sent a few representatives and group leaders to study and then returned the property, while others were handled by district cadres who took over the responsibility without persuading the representatives and the masses, adopting the simple method of forced orders such as \"returning it, whether you want to or not,\" which caused dissatisfaction among poor peasants and farm laborers and greatly affected the work. The county party committee has pointed out that in future production movements, it is necessary to continue to vigorously implement the policy of correctly treating middle peasants, thoroughly correct deviations, and further unite middle and poor peasants in production.\n\nAfter correcting the deviations that infringed upon the interests of middle peasants, most middle peasants clarified our party's policies, stabilized their morale, and improved their production enthusiasm. Middle peasant Sun Shouxin said, \"Everyone's eyes are really bright! Everyone knows who is who, and we can't make mistakes.\" After Cui Zhengyan, a middle peasant in Beidong Village, Fourth District, was wrongly struggled against, his family stopped working, and the weaving machine was also stopped. After the correction of deviations, his family's enthusiasm for work was revived.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 河间纠正错斗偏向中农生产情绪提高\n\n1948-07-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　河间纠正错斗偏向中农生产情绪提高\n    【冀中讯】河间在土地改革中，有半数以上的村庄，或轻或重的侵犯了一些中农利益，引起其他中农的恐慌，影响了他们的生产情绪。自三月底县委召开全县代表联席会，明确研究了划阶级的标准，贯彻了坚决不侵犯中农利益的政策后，一般村庄已经纠正或正在纠正中。\n    根据统计：全县有侵犯中农利益的现象共一百六十个村，侵犯了六百五十六户。其中有三百二十五户是因为想弄东西提高了成份；有的因为定成份时从民主政府成立往前追的太远（追二十年左右）而定错了；有的是因为有点轻微剥削而提高的；因政治、经济分不清而动了东西的有九十八户。侵犯的情形和程度也不一样，有一百九十九户错封了门，弄了大部或一部东西。有一百六十九户未封门而强迫弄了部分东西或土地。有一百八十一户封了门没弄东西。被扣押的有一百零七户。在土改开始时，许多村庄的贫农团排斥中农也很严重，如限制中农活动买卖，光让中农出战勤等，引起中农的恐慌不满。有的中农怕斗，给贫农团代表送礼，有的怕弄东西而坚壁起来，有的大吃大喝，认为吃了是赚头。春耕时有些中农不种地不上粪，怕种上再分给别人，对我党团结中农政策表示了很大的怀疑。\n    侵犯中农的主要原因：一方面是当时划阶级的标准不明确，有些领导干部存在着“拔尖思想”，或是迁就群众的尾巴主义，或存在着单纯的贫雇农观点；一方面是有一部分贫雇农抱着“吃肉疙瘩”的想头，还有少数流氓分子想“乘机发财”，故意提高中农成份；有的是贫农团组织不纯，被地主坏分子掌握，转移了斗争目标，损害了中农利益。\n    在全县代表联席会上，先学习了中央关于划阶级定成份的文件，接着联系本村情况进行检讨，经过县委解释、诱导，一般的搞通了思想，并讨论了纠正的办法。会后各地抓紧贯彻政策、纠正偏向。在纠正的方法上，一般村庄都通过农会（或贫农团）小组会，反复讲明定成份的标准，重新讨论审查错定的成份；经过多数群众同意后，即改正错定成份，并根据被侵犯的实际情况，退回全部或一部东西。召开错斗户讲明道理，说明他们不该再怀疑和不满。有些东西实际上不能全部退回的，即向错斗户道歉，他本人同意了可不退；如不退而会影响错斗户的、生活和生产的，则想尽一切办法退回。现全县已纠正了一百二十三个村，彻底纠正了四百八十户。但纠偏中也发生了些毛病，有的村仅出少数代表和组长研究一下就退了，有的是区干部包办代替，不说服代表和群众，采取了“退也退、不退也得退”的强迫命令的简单方法，因此引起了贫雇农的不满，使工作受到很大影响。县委已指出在今后生产运动中，继续大力贯彻端正对中农的政策，彻底纠偏，使中贫农更进一步的团结生产。\n    经过纠正侵犯中农的偏向后，一般中农都明确了我党的政策，情绪稳定，生产情绪提高，中农孙守信说：“大伙眼光真亮！谁是什么主儿都知道，不能错了。”四区北冬村中农崔正严被错斗后，一家子活也不干，织布机也停了。经过纠偏，一家子干活又起了劲。"

    "content": "IX. Helping the Japanese Bandits Re-Invade China\n\nAll the above-mentioned measures taken by the United States to support Japan have resulted, in part, in Japan re-invading China. In fact, the re-invasion of China by Japanese aggressors with the help of the United States is not just a possibility; in many respects, it is already happening.\n\nUnder MacArthur's orders, the Chiang government decided on August 1st of last year to formally resume Sino-Japanese trade, agreeing to supply Japan with raw materials such as salt, iron, coal, soybeans, and tung oil. In January of this year, the Chiang government's delegation to Japan signed a contract with the Japanese government to export 20,000 tons of soybeans to Japan. At the same time, another batch of 30,000 tons is being negotiated. The number of Chinese salt exports to Japan was 500,000 tons the year before last, 200,000 tons last year, and is planned to be 500,000 tons this year. The amount of ore was 200,000 tons the year before last, the number for last year is unknown, but 250,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island, which was ordered at the end of last year, is currently being shipped. Relying mainly on Hainan Island's iron ore, the production volume of Japan's largest steel factory – Yawata Steel Works – is increasing monthly, and its second rolling mill has now reopened. Fearing that the supply of Hainan Island iron ore would be insufficient, MacArthur introduced Takeda Kengo, president of Asahi Industries, and Keiichi Iriye and Genkura Okada, key members of Taihei Industries, to Song Ziwen in April this year to expand iron ore mining on Hainan Island. In the same month, a delegation led by North, director of the Civil Affairs Division of the US Army Department, passed through Tokyo to Nanjing and Shanghai to draft plans on how to expand Sino-Japanese trade and implement the plan of \"American capital, Japanese industry, and Chinese raw materials.\"\n\nAs for goods imported from Japan, in addition to machinery, sleepers, locomotives, vehicles, rails, explosives, and other war-related materials needed by Chiang's bandits for the civil war, there are also cotton textiles, rayon, paper, dyes, bicycles, and seafood. According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily on July 22nd of last year, \"Japan's planned exports this year are primarily yarn and textiles, accounting for slightly less than half of the total. Raw silk and rayon account for about a quarter. Machinery accounts for one-tenth. The rest are ceramics, glass, aquatic products, and medicines. Looking at these tables, it is an epitome of Japan's export items before the war. It is a weapon for a light industrial country to carry out economic aggression against colonies and semi-colonies. … (China) will still be bound in this typical colonial trade network, at a loss.\"\n\nReports on the smuggling of Japanese goods are occasionally published in the Chiang-controlled areas. South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have become three transshipment points for Japanese goods, flowing into North China from South Korea and into Guangzhou and Shanghai from Hong Kong and Taiwan, dumping goods in central and southern China. Japanese-made daily necessities and cotton textiles often imitate American trademarks. Genuine and fake American goods flood the major coastal cities of our country.\n\nIn May 1946, after MacArthur allowed Japan to hunt whales in the Antarctic, he also ordered Chiang Kai-shek to conclude an agreement with the US occupation headquarters, allowing 40 Japanese fishing vessels to enter the high seas between China and Japan to fish. As a result, Japanese fishing boats further intruded into our territorial waters. In recent years, such acts of aggression have occurred frequently. In just one recent instance in late May, nearly 20 fishing vessels were discovered by the Chiang government's warship Zhongjian, penetrating 150 nautical miles into our territorial waters. According to the \"Record of Japanese Fishing Vessels Fishing Beyond the Border\" written by Harada Seiichi, a Japanese fishing boat crew member, translated by the Tianjin Xin Xing Daily on May 3rd, and the Central News Agency's Shanghai report on June 1st about the Chiang government seizing Japanese fishing boats, these fishing boats were converted from gunboats, equipped with weapons or even gun emplacements, and the crew members were former Japanese naval personnel, not only wearing military uniforms but also bearing \"China Incident\" commemorative badges. However, the Chiang government's Ministry of Navy stipulates that fishing vessels caught intruding into our territorial waters will only have their fishing gear confiscated, and the personnel will be returned to the Allied Headquarters for handling, but the Allied Headquarters has never handled a single case. The Beiping Xinmin Daily stated on May 26th: \"If we hand over the Japanese who specialize in undermining China's territorial sovereignty to the Allied Headquarters, and the Allied Headquarters give them special training, these Japanese will be able to easily become vanguards for coastal landings with real weapons.\"\n\nAs for our compatriots residing in Japan, they still do not have the status of citizens of a victorious nation and are regarded as \"third-country people.\" Under US indulgence, the reactionary Japanese government has canceled the same food rations that our overseas Chinese should enjoy as British, American, and other foreign overseas Chinese, closed 3,000 overseas Chinese restaurants, and frozen 2 billion Japanese yen in pre-war deposits of overseas Chinese, making it impossible for unemployed overseas Chinese to return to China. Japanese police arbitrarily search the homes and shops of overseas Chinese and confiscate goods. All these heartbreaking facts have received the support of the American authorities. In July 1946, police officers from the Shibuya Japanese Police Station in Tokyo unreasonably drove out Taiwanese overseas Chinese vendors in the area and massacred them with machine guns, causing dozens of casualties. The US occupation authorities not only refused to punish the perpetrators but ordered the Taiwanese to be deported. Afterward, the Japanese government expressed gratitude to MacArthur's headquarters for supporting the illegal atrocities of the Japanese bandits and decided to strengthen the \"crackdown\" on \"non-Japanese.\"\n\nAs the arrogance of the Japanese bandits' re-invasion of China is constantly encouraged, Japanese parliamentarians have openly demanded in parliament that referendums be held in the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and Northeast China to determine their status; Ashida has demanded that the United States return the Ryukyu Islands and requested special immigration rights for Taiwan. On May 11th, the Chinese-language \"China-Japan Daily\" in Tokyo even clamored for \"the merger of China and Japan,\" and the Japanese who retreated from the Northeast also repeatedly shouted: \"We will be back in twenty years.\" If the United States' actions to support Japan are not stopped, the Japanese bandits will eventually launch another war of aggression against China.\n\nThe policy of US imperialism to support the Japanese bandits at the expense of China did not begin today. At the time of the September 18th Incident, US Secretary of State Stimson touted the so-called \"non-recognition doctrine,\" but in fact, secret documents released by the US State Department the year before last proved that the US policy at the time was to \"prevent international action against Japan from being too extreme\" and to \"oppose the use of economic sanctions.\" (According to the Dagong Daily on June 26th of the year before last) Throughout the period from the September 18th Incident to shortly before the Pacific War, the United States supplied Japan with large quantities of materials. During the July 7th War of Aggression against China, Japanese planes used American gasoline and American scrap iron to make bombs and bombed peaceful Chinese cities and residents.\n\n　　　　　X. Preparing for a New War of Aggression\n\nIn addition to turning Japan into an \"Asian factory\" for American monopoly capital, the above-mentioned US support for Japan is also preparing to use Japan as a base for a new war of aggression. In order to realize its expansionist policy of dominating the world, American imperialists are rebuilding two reactionary strongholds of aggression in the eastern and western hemispheres, one is Germany, and the other is Japan. Just as they did in Germany, they are preserving and preparing to expand Japan's war industry, rebuild Japan's armed forces, and build Japanese military bases, all in preparation for when they launch their envisioned future Third World War, \"the Japanese will put on American uniforms and fight alongside the American army.\" (Quoted from US Congressman Short)\n\nMcGowan, the so-called Far East problem authority appointed by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee to investigate the economic situation in the Far East, pointed out in his report on February 29th that Japan is today the fortress of American sympathy and thought in the Far East, and if Japan continues to maintain \"reasonable prosperity,\" it will naturally be a \"fortress against communism.\" Recently, George Kennan, chairman of the US State Department's Policy Planning Committee, openly declared that the United States wants to \"build Japan into an anti-Soviet industrial and military base\" (according to the March 22nd issue of US Newsweek). This is not a new thing. As early as a year after Japan's surrender, the six members of the US House Military Committee inspection team, \"influenced by the soldiers under MacArthur\" (according to US Democratic Congressman Sabath), deliberately spread the rumor of a \"second Pearl Harbor incident imminent\" in Tokyo as an excuse for the United States to make military preparations in the Pacific again. Shortly thereafter, in his speech on September 2nd commemorating the first anniversary of Japan's surrender, MacArthur clamored that \"the conflict between Western democracy and 'Soviet imperialism' currently underway in various parts of Asia will directly lead to a new and open undeclared war in Asia,\" and he hinted that this conflict was intensifying in Japan, China, Korea, as well as the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Singapore, Burma, Vietnam, India, and other parts of Asia. Therefore, he paid special attention to \"Japan's strategic position in this conflict.\"\n\nJapan has become the vanguard of American reactionaries in suppressing the national democratic movements of Eastern countries and preparing to launch a new world war. The Chinese people remember that, based on fifty years of experience, the first target of Japan's war of aggression was China. American imperialists currently have this intention: to arm and command the Japanese army to come to China to participate in the Chinese civil war, assist Chiang Kai-shek, oppose the People's Liberation Army, and attempt to prevent the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. To keep China in a semi-colonial state of American imperialism, and to become a semi-colony of Japanese imperialism again. Precisely because of this, the American imperialist's reactionary policy of supporting Japan has been strongly opposed by peace-loving people all over the world and has isolated itself; our people, in this just movement against the American policy of supporting Japan, stand at the forefront of the people of the world. (The End)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝扶日真相（续完）\n\n1948-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝扶日真相（续完）\n  　　　　　九、扶助日寇重新侵华\n    上述一切美国扶日的措施，其主要结果之一，就是使日本从新侵略中国。事实上日本侵略者在美国帮助下从新侵略中国，已经不仅是一种可能性，在许多方面，是已经见诸行动了。\n    在麦克阿瑟的命令之下，蒋政府去年八月一日决定正式恢复中日贸易，允将盐、铁、煤、大豆、桐油等原料供给日本。今年一月间蒋政府驻日代表团与日政府签订了二万吨大豆输日的合同。同时，另一批三万吨的合同也正在商订。我国食盐输日的数字，前年为五十万吨，去年为二十万吨，今年则计划为五十万吨。矿砂的数字，前年为二十万吨，去年数字不明，但去年年底所订之二十五万吨海南岛铁砂，现正在赶运中。依靠着海南岛铁砂为主要原料，日本全国最大的钢铁工厂——八幡钢铁厂——的生产量，逐月提高，而且现在又重开了其第二辗钢厂。麦克阿瑟惟恐海南岛铁砂供应不够，今年四月又给宋子文介绍了朝日工业社社长竹田建吾和太平工业社要员进来要一和冈田源仓，前往海南岛去扩大铁矿的开采。同月，美陆军部民政司长诺斯率领的代表团，经过东京到南京和上海，来拟订如何扩大中日贸易，如何实行“资本美国、工业日本、原料中国”的计划。\n    至于由日本的进口货物，除了蒋匪需要的机器、枕木、火车头、车辆、铁轨、炸药等供作内战的与军事有关的物资外，便是棉毛织物、人造丝、纸张、染料、脚踏车、海味等物。据去年七月二十二日天津大公报披露：“日本今年计划输出的第一位纱布及纤维品，占全数之半弱。其次生丝及人造丝，约占四分之一。机器占十分之一。其余便是些陶瓷、玻璃、水产物及药品等。看这些表，正是战前日本输出项目的缩影。是一个轻工业国家对殖民地半殖民地实施经济侵略的武器。……（中国）今后仍将被捆在这个殖民地典型的贸易网里，一筹莫展。”\n    关于日货走私的报导，蒋区报纸时有登载，南鲜、台湾、及香港已成为日货走私的三个转运地，由南鲜流入华北，由香港、台湾流入广州、上海，倾销华中、华南各地。日造日用品及棉毛织物多假冒美货商标。真假美货，一同泛滥于我国沿海各大城市。\n    一九四六年五月，麦克阿瑟继允许日本南极捕鲸之后，又叫蒋介石与美占领军总部缔结协定，准许日本渔轮四十艘进入中日间的公海捕鱼；于是日本渔船就进一步侵入我领海，年来此种侵略行为层出不穷，仅在最近五月下旬，被蒋政府兵舰中建号发现的一次即有渔轮近二十艘，其深入我领海已有一百五十海里。据五月三日天津新星报译载日本渔船船员原田清一所写的“日本渔船越界捕鱼记”和中央社上海六月一日报导蒋政府缉获日渔轮的消息透露，该项渔轮系炮艇改装，且拥有武器或甚至有炮位，船员则有前日本海军人员，不仅身着军服，且配有“支那事变”的纪念章。但蒋政府的海军部规定，捕获侵入我领海的渔轮仅没收其渔具，人员送还盟总办理，而盟总则从未办理过一次。五月二十六日北平新民报说道：“我们若把专门破坏中国领土主权的日人交给盟总，盟总加以特殊训练，未来这批日人正可以驾轻就熟，成为真刀真枪的海岸登陆先锋。”\n    至于我国留日侨胞，仍然没有战胜国国民的地位，被看作是“第三国人”。美国骄纵之下，日本反动政府，取消了我国侨民所应享有的与英美以及其他外国侨民同等的食粮配量给，封闭了三千华侨餐馆，冻结了华侨战前二十亿日圆的存款，使失业侨胞无法回国。日警随意搜查华侨家宅和商店，没收货物之事，且有所闻。所有这一切令人痛心的事实，都得到了美国当局的支持。一九四六年七月，东京涩谷日本警察署的警察，无理驱逐该地台湾侨胞摊贩，并以机枪屠杀，伤亡台胞数十人。美国占领当局不但拒绝惩凶，反令驱逐台胞出境。事后日政府曾对麦克阿瑟总部支持日寇非法暴行的态度，表示谢忱，并决定要加强“非日本人”之“取缔”。\n    由于日寇从新侵华的气焰不断受到鼓励，日本议员曾在议会公开要求在琉球、台湾和东北举行公民投票，以决定它们的地位；芦田除向美国要求收回琉球外，并要求台湾之特别移民权。五月十一日东京华文“中日日报”竟然叫嚣“中日两国应当合并”，而自东北撤退之日侨，亦曾口口声声喊道：“二十年后再来”。如果美国扶助日本的行为不被制止，则日寇终有一天将重新发动侵华战争。\n    美国帝国主义者扶助日寇牺牲中国的政策，并非自今日始。九一八事变当时美国国务卿史汀生曾标榜所谓“不承认主义”，但事实上，前年美国国务院发表的秘密文件证明，当时美国的政策是“阻止国际对日行动切勿操之过激”，是“反对施用经济制裁”。（据前年六月二十六日大公报）从九一八到太平洋战争前不久的整个时期，美国都以大量物资供给了日本。七七侵华战争中，日本飞机就用美国的汽油和美国废铁制成炸弹，轰炸了中国和平的城市居民。\n    　　　　十、准备新的侵略战争\n    上述美国扶助日本的种种作为，除了把日本变成美国独占资本的“亚洲工厂”之外，就是准备用日本作为新的侵略战争的基地。为着实现其独霸世界的扩张政策，美国帝国主义者正在东西两半球重建两个侵略的反动堡垒，一是德国，另一个就是日本。象他们在德国所作的一样，他们保存并准备扩大日本的战争工业，重建日本的武装，修建日本的军事基地，为的就是准备当他们发动其心目中的未来第三次世界大战的时候，“日本人将穿起美国军装，与美军并肩作战”。（美众议员萧特语）\n    美众院外交委员会所任命的调查远东经济情况之所谓远东问题权威人士麦克格文，二月二十九日在其报告中指出：日本为今日美国在远东之同情心及思想之堡垒，若日本继续保持“合理之繁荣”，则当然为“对抗共产主义之堡垒”。最近美国国务院政策设计委员会主席凯南公然声称美国要“把日本建成反苏的工业和军事基地”（据三月二十二日美国新闻周刊）。这并不是新鲜的事情，早在日本投降还不过一年的时候，美国众院军事委员会考察团的六位委员，因“受麦克阿瑟麾下军人之影响”（美民主党议员萨巴斯语），便故意在东京发出了“第二珍珠港事变一触即发”的谣言，以为美国在太平洋重作军事准备的借口。接着不久，麦克阿瑟在九月二日纪念日本投降一周年的演说中，就叫嚣“目前亚洲各地已在进行中的西方民主主义及‘苏联帝国主义’的冲突，将直接引致亚洲新而公开的未宣布的战争”，并且暗示这种冲突在日本、中国、朝鲜、以及菲律宾、印尼、马来亚、新加坡、缅甸、越南、印度以及亚洲其他地方正在日益加剧，因而他特别提起注意“在此冲突中之日本战略地位”。\n    日本是变成美国反动派镇压东方各国民族民主运动和准备发动新的世界大战的先锋了。中国人民都记得，五十年来的经验，日本侵略战争的第一个目标，就是中国。美国帝国主义者目前即已有这种打算，就是武装并指挥日本军队到中国来参加中国内战，援助蒋介石，反对人民解放军，企图阻止中国人民革命战争的胜利。使中国继续保持为美国帝国主义的半殖民地状态，并从新成为日本帝国主义的半殖民地。正因为如此，美国帝国主义的反动的扶日政策，遭到全世界爱好和平的人民的强烈反对而把自己孤立起来；我国人民，在这个反对美国扶日政策的正义运动中，则站在世界人民的前列。（完）"

Dade, the former head of the Textile Group at the US military headquarters in Japan, flew to Shanghai on May 27th to take up the post of advisor to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee of the Kuomintang's Ministry of Economic Affairs. An American named Colonel Ike has become an advisor to the Police General Administration of the Kuomintang's Ministry of Interior. Ike accompanied the head of the administration, the Kuomintang secret service chief Tang Zong, to Fuzhou and Xiamen in the middle of last month for inspection. An American named Bailey has become an advisor to the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Communications. Furthermore, according to a Taiwan dispatch published in the Qingdao Civilian Daily on April 14th, \"all departments of the Kuomintang-run 'Taiwan Sugar Factory' have American advisors.\" American advisors have great power in the Chiang Kai-shek government, can move around at will, and enjoy the highest待遇. A man named Pond, who is currently an advisor to the Kuomintang's Ministry of Judicial Administration, led a judicial inspection group from the Chiang Kai-shek government to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places for investigation last month. As revealed by the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on June 15th, Pond's monthly salary is 2,500 US dollars (equivalent to approximately 11.75 billion Chiang Kai-shek currency at the current black market exchange rate for the US dollar), equal to the total salary of 200 Chinese judges or 400 Chinese judicial police officers. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, Dade's monthly salary also reaches 1,500 US dollars. Their待遇 is higher than the salary income of the US Vice President and cabinet ministers.

On the evening of the 3rd, a unit of the Liberation Army cleared out the outposts around the city and launched an attack. The defending enemy broke through in a northwest direction but was completely annihilated by our forces. Lianshui County, which had been occupied for a year and a half, was thus recovered. According to preliminary statistics, the battle resulted in the annihilation of the entire 486th Regiment of the 162nd Brigade of the Regular 44th Division, most of the Lianshui Security Regiment, and a portion of the local armed forces. Over 1,800 enemy troops were captured, including Lu Ce-san, the commander of the 486th Regiment and concurrently the commander of the Huai-Lian Anti-Bandit Command, as well as over 1,000 local armed forces. Over 200 were killed or wounded. The spoils included two anti-tank guns, eleven 82mm mortars, twenty 60mm mortars, twenty-five heavy machine guns, over one hundred and twenty light machine guns, over seven hundred rifles and carbines, over ten thousand rounds of machine gun and rifle ammunition, and three radio transmitters. It should be noted that Shuyang County, northwest of Lianshui, and Funing County, east of Lianshui, which had been occupied by the enemy in late May, were recovered in early June.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 11th. The Jianghan Liberation Army annihilated over two thousand one hundred enemy troops in the area west of Yingcheng.

When they advanced to the Longwangji area west of Yingcheng, they were met with a devastating blow by our powerful forces. Except for a small number who escaped, the majority were annihilated. According to preliminary statistics: 2009 enemy soldiers were killed, 352 were wounded, and 1565 officers and soldiers, including the deputy commander of the 97th Regiment, were captured.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th: Comprehensive reports: Since June 11th, the situation in Palestine during the four weeks of the armistice has further revealed that British and American imperialism, after making compromises, are trying to abolish Israel's independence in order to maintain their rule over Palestine. During this period, they have engaged in two conspiracies: First, through the so-called United Nations \"mediator\" Bernadotte, during \"peace negotiations\" with the Arabs and Israelis, they set a trap of a so-called \"federation\" plan to undermine the UN General Assembly's decision on the partition of Palestine and forcibly incorporate Israel into the system of British and American puppet states in the Middle East. According to Agence France-Presse: On the 3rd of this month, Bernadotte announced his \"peace proposal\" submitted to both the Arab and Israeli sides on June 28th, which stipulated that the Palestinian Arab area in the UN General Assembly's partition decision, the Negev area belonging to Israel, and Jerusalem and other places that should be under UN trusteeship should be incorporated into Transjordan; the port of Haifa in Israel and the Lydda Airport near the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv should be set up as free ports and free air stations; and that Transjordan, after expanding its territory, and Israel, which had been stripped of its independence, should jointly form a \"federation\" under the jurisdiction of a so-called \"Central Committee.\" Behind this so-called \"federation\" plan, according to former Haganah commander Sneh: \"The British and Americans may have divided the real control as follows: Britain continues to rule Transjordan, while the United States rules Israel.\" Second, Britain and the United States used the so-called \"armistice\" to give the Arab armies a respite and enable them to invade convenient and strategically important positions in preparation for continuing to indulge the Arab armies in the war of conquest against the State of Israel once the conspiracy to abolish Israel's independence through \"peace\" failed, using threats to achieve their imperialist goals. Throughout the armistice period, Arab armies have continuously attacked Israeli-occupied areas. On June 12th, Arab armies attacked villages near the important airbase of Lydda; on the 24th, Arab armies attacked the village of El-Burj near the northern stronghold of Yakir; on the 25th, Egyptian aircraft not only bombed Israeli territory, but also openly shot at United Nations inspection aircraft; on the 3rd of this month, Arab armies in Jerusalem and many other places opened fire on Israelis. Despite facing these conspiracies and threats by American and British imperialism, Israel's determination to fight for national independence has not wavered. The Israeli government officially rejected Bernadotte's \"federation\" plan on the 6th. A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said: \"The Israeli government cannot accept any encroachment on its territory or restrictions on its sovereignty\" (Agence France-Presse). Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion also declared when British troops withdrew from Haifa at the end of June: \"We are stronger on land, sea, and air than we were on the day we declared independence. Although we desire peace, if our enemies choose the path of war, we are prepared for war\" (TASS).\n    \nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th: TASS, June 6th: British Communist Member of Parliament Piratin told a reporter from the Czech Telegraph Agency in London that the main purpose of the plan proposed by Bernadotte, the United Nations mediator in Palestine, to establish an Arab and Jewish federation is to divide the Middle East for British and American imperialists. The plan, on the one hand, aims to make Transjordan stronger than Israel, and on the other hand, places both Israel and Transjordan under permanent British and American rule. As a result, it neither conforms to the interests of the Jewish people nor to the interests of the Arab people, but only reflects the interests of British and American oil companies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英美阴谋取消以国独立　以色列拒绝“联邦”计划\n\n1948-07-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英美阴谋取消以国独立\n    以色列拒绝“联邦”计划\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：自六月十一日迄今，停战四周期间的巴勒斯坦局势，已更加显示英、美帝国主义在作了妥协之后，正力图取消以色列的独立，以保持他们对巴勒斯坦的统治。在此期间，他们玩弄了两种阴谋：第一、他们经由所谓联合国“调停人”伯纳杜特在与阿拉伯、以色列进行“和平谈判”时，布置一个所谓“联邦”计划的陷阱，以破坏联大对巴勒斯坦分治的决定，并强使以色列并入英、美在中东傀儡国家的体系中。据法新社消息：本月三日，伯纳杜特公布其在六月二十八日送交阿以双方的“和平建议”，其中规定：将联大分治决定中的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人区域、属于以色列的内革布区域，以及应由联合国托管的耶路撒冷等地并入外约旦；将以色列的海法港及以色列首都特拉维夫附近的里达机场，设为自由港及自由航空站；又将扩大领土以后的外约旦和被取消了独立的以色列合组“联邦”，由一个所谓“中央委员会”管辖。在这个所谓“联邦”计划的背后，据前犹太自卫军总司令斯奈说：“英、美或许曾将真正的控制权划分如下：英国继续统治外约旦，而美国则统治以色列。”第二，英美利用所谓“停战”给阿拉伯军队以喘息机会，并使他们能够侵入便利而有战略意义的阵地以准备一旦“和平”取消以色列独立的阴谋失败后，继续放纵阿拉伯军实行对以色列国的战争征服，借威胁手法以实现其帝国主义的目的。在整个停战期间，阿拉伯军队曾不断地进袭以色列占领地区。六月十二日，阿军进攻重要航空基地里达附近的村庄；二十四日，阿军进攻北部要地亚克附近的埃尔伯村；二十五日，埃及飞机不仅轰炸以色列领土，而且公然射击联合国的视察飞机；本月三日，耶路撒冷及其他许多地方的阿军，均开枪射击以色列人。虽然面对着美英帝国主义所玩弄的这些阴谋与威胁，但是，以色列争取民族独立的意志并未动摇。以色列政府已于六日正式拒绝了伯纳杜特的“联邦”方案，该国外交部发表的公报称：“以色列政府不能接受任何对其领土的蚕食或对其主权的限制”（法新社）。以色列总理本古利安于六月底英军撤出海法之时亦宣称：“我们在陆上、海上和空中，都比宣布独立之日更为强大了。虽然我们愿望和平，但是如果我们的敌人选择战争的途径，我们就准备战争”（塔斯社）。\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社六日讯：英共下院议员皮拉丁于接见捷克电报通讯社驻伦敦记者时称：联合国巴勒斯坦调停人伯纳杜特所提成立阿拉伯及犹太联邦的计划，其主要目的是为英美帝国主义者分割中东。该计划一方面要使外约旦比以色列更强，另一方面将以色列及外约旦均置于英美永久统治之下。其结果，既不符合于犹太人民的利益，也不符合于阿拉伯人民的利益，只是特别反映了英美石油公司的利益。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to various sources, the price surge in the Chiang-controlled areas, after reaching its peak on June 26th, only paused for a week before a new wave began. The short-term, slight price decline at the end of June and the beginning of July was due to the banks' mid-year closing of accounts and tight monetary conditions. According to Associated Press and United Press reports, on the 3rd of this month, the price of rice in Shanghai set a new record of 26 million (Chiang currency - hereinafter the same), an increase of 2 million compared to the highest price of the previous wave, and 2.6 million times the price of rice before the War of Resistance. The black market exchange rate for US dollars has also rebounded, with sellers asking 4.7 million Chiang currency per US dollar. Other commodities have also uniformly increased in price. Laundries have announced a doubling of prices, hotel room rates have increased by 90 percent, and public utilities and transportation have increased sharply. Shanghai water, electricity and other public utilities, after announcing a price increase of 29 to 35 percent on the 14th of last month, announced another price increase of 80 to 190 percent on the 4th of this month, an increase of one to three times compared to 20 days ago. Chiang's \"state-run\" transportation services such as aviation, shipping, and postal services have also successively announced price increases (according to this, it is the second price increase in less than a month since June 7th). It is estimated that \"China\" and \"Central\" airlines have increased by 100 to 220 percent since July 2nd, the post office increased by 200 percent, and passenger and freight shipping increased by 80 percent of the original price since June 29th. It is expected that the price increase of public utilities and transportation will stimulate a more violent rise in prices.

The Ministry of Interior of the Chiang government announced that the newspaper was ordered to be \"permanently suspended\" on the grounds of \"spreading rumors, inciting people, and demoralizing morale.\" The facts it cited were due to the newspaper's past fragmentary disclosure in news reports of some truths about Chiang Kai-shek's military defeats and the brutal massacre of peaceful people. For example, the article \"Looking at the Northwest War Situation\" published on April 14 reported that Chiang's army was short of troops and \"controlled by others.\" The June 26 issue carried a conversation with students in Kaifeng, saying that \"large and small buildings in the commercial district of Kaifeng were bombed by the air force, and 60,000 to 70,000 people were killed or injured.\" The newspaper has five editions in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Chongqing, and Chengdu. Its general manager is Chen Mingde, a member of the Kuomintang, and the manager of its Nanjing edition is Chen Mingde's wife and a legislator of the puppet government, Deng Jixing. It is widely believed that the Chiang government's closure of Xinmin Daily at this time, in addition to generally maintaining its rule of rumors and reactionary propaganda, is related to its exaggerating the fabricated Yudong victory and prohibiting the disclosure of the truth about the Yudong fiasco.

Men Donggui is 69 years old this year. He started as a worker on a track maintenance team in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign. Despite his hard work, he was still beaten and bullied, and there was no hope of getting ahead. During the Japanese occupation, he was falsely accused of being a \"Eighth Route Army\" member, suffered severe torture, and was imprisoned. After the Kuomintang \"took over,\" they said he was \"too old to be hired\" and dismissed him under that pretext. He received no retirement pension, and his family relied entirely on selling clothes to make a living. After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, he actively led workers in construction based on his many years of experience and overcame many difficulties. The workers elected him as the engineering team leader and affectionately called him \"Leader Men.\" On the 18th of last month, the Railway Bureau decided to promote him to section chief. When he returned to the bureau from his work location to report on his work, the reporter paid him a special visit. He was chatting with a comrade from the United University about his decades of hardship and his current happiness. He said: \"I couldn't get promoted before! Without money to 'lobby,' you don't stand a chance!\" Then he said with a smile: \"Now it is very different from before.

    "content": "[Hebei Central News] The Xin Yuan Iron Factory in the old city of Shulu was founded in June 1946 by six ironworkers. At that time, they were empty-handed, without houses or furniture. Later, with the help of friends, they raised 1 million yuan (border currency, same below) in shares, rented eight rooms in the most remote area, bought some scrap iron, borrowed furniture from colleagues, and made tools such as hammers, anvils, pliers, and benches for the furnace, and began to operate as a partnership. The workers worked hard and diligently, using scrap iron to build a lathe in more than two months. Because the capital was too small, they constantly encountered various difficulties during construction. When they didn't have money to buy iron and coal, they赊 (shē: buy on credit), sold the finished products, and then paid in cash. But everyone never lost heart and continued to work hard. Later, with the support of the bank, they made more than 100 kinds of tools necessary for the factory. By September, the textile industry was active, and there was a great shortage of parts for 풍궁 (punggong: a type of bow-shaped tool) and rolling machines. Merchants from Xinji and Botou came to the factory to order goods, and business slowly began to flourish, further boosting everyone's production enthusiasm. After four months of painstaking operation, at the end of the year, the accounting showed that they had earned a set of factory furniture (worth 5 million yuan), and the workers also received a dividend of 1 million yuan. In the spring of the second year, in order to further expand operations, the workers pooled their dividends and borrowed another 2 million yuan from the Dazhong Bank to buy more than a dozen houses with storefronts on East Street. They also recruited several workers, increasing the total number of workers in the factory to eleven.\n    The iron industry operated by the factory was seasonal, with March to July being the slack season. At that time, the factory was in the stage of business development and needed a lot of funds. Therefore, new difficulties arose. By May, the coal and iron raw materials had been used up, and they still owed the bank 10 million yuan, and 3,000 catties of wages and rice could not be paid. The factory and the workers were very worried, and the factory was on the verge of closing down. In order to save the factory, the workers voluntarily requested to be exempted from three months' wages. At that time, the factory appropriately reduced the wages of workers without shares, while all workers with shares were exempted from wages. The entire factory shared weal and woe for three months, and in the autumn and winter seasons, business flourished again. At the end of the year, the net profit was 12 million yuan. At this time, the factory paid the workers five months' wages and rice (100 catties for workers, 60-70 catties for trainees), and the profits were divided equally between labor and capital. The highest-paid worker received 1,280 catties, and the trainees also received 600 catties. This year, the factory has added two new apprentices and made a planer, which can now produce轧花轴 (zhá huā zhóu: ginning shafts) and other small parts. They are now actively preparing to add a casting department. This year is also experiencing a slack season, but the factory is not afraid. With capital and experience, some workers have invested last year's wages into factory re-production, and the Bianqu (Border Region) Bank's business department is also preparing to vigorously support them. Now they have saved a lot of raw materials, and are producing finished products according to the season and the needs of the people, while also mass-producing various 풍궁 (punggong: a type of bow-shaped tool) parts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 信源铁工厂是怎样发展起来的？\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　信源铁工厂是怎样发展起来的？\n    【冀中讯】束鹿旧城信源铁工厂，是在民国三十五年六月由六个铁业工人创办的。当时他们赤手空拳，房子家具都没有，后来得到朋友的帮助，集了一百万元（边币，下同）的股，在最偏僻的地方租了八间房，收买了一部分废铁，借用同事的家具，制成了烘炉上用的锤、案、钳、班子等工具，开始合伙经营起来。工人们热心的苦干硬干，利用废铁，花费了两个多月的时间，造成了一架旋床。本钱太小，在建设当中不断遇到各种困难。买铁买煤没有钱，就凭着信用先赊了来，卖出成品再交付现款。但是大家从不灰心，仍继续努力。后来得到了银号的扶植，制成了工厂所必需的一百多种工具。到了九月，纺织业活跃了，风弓轧车的零件非常缺，辛集、泊头的商人都到工厂来订货，生意才慢慢烘火起来，大家生产热情更高了。经过四个月的苦心经营，到年底结帐时，赚了一套工厂的家具（合五百万元），工人们还批了一百万的红利。第二年春天，工人们为了更进一步的扩大经营，把分得的红利集结起来，又从大众银号贷款二百万元，在东大街上买了十多间有门面的房子，又招收了几个工人，全厂增加到十一个人。\n    工厂经营的铁业带有季节性，每年三月到七月是淡月；当时工厂正处在经营发展的阶段，需用大量的资金；于是产生了新的困难，到了五月，煤铁原料已经用完，还欠下银号一千万元，工资米三千斤无法偿付。厂方和工人都很着急，眼看着工厂要倒闭了。工人为了挽救工厂，自动要求免除三个月的工资。当时厂方对没有股金的工人，适当的减低了工资，有股金的工人则全部免除了工资。全厂患难与共三个月，到了秋冬两季，生意又烘火起来。年底结帐，净赚一千二百万元。厂方这时补发给工人五个月的工资米（工人百斤，学员六、七十斤），并将盈利按劳资折半分红，最高的工人批了一千二百八十斤，学员也分得了六百斤。今年该厂又新添了两个学徒，制成了一架刨床，已可出产轧花轴及其他小的机件。现在正积极筹备添设翻砂部。今年同样有淡月，但是工厂不怕了，有了资本，有了经验，有些工人把去年的工资投入工厂再生产，边区银行营业部也准备大力的扶植他们。现在他们存下了不少的原料，一面根据季节和人民的需要出产成品，一面在大量的赶制各种风弓零件。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Jizhong News: With the rainy season approaching and the flood season imminent, the Jizhong Administrative Office convened a flood prevention meeting on June 13th to review last year's flood prevention work and study future flood prevention measures. Director Hao of the Public Works Bureau gave a report at the meeting, pointing out that last year, in addition to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits breaching the dikes of the Daqing River and the Grand Canal to create floods, no other rivers breached. Cadres and the masses worked day and night to intensify flood prevention. Commissioners of the eighth, ninth, and tenth districts and county magistrates of Raoyang and other counties personally went to the dikes to inspect and check, leading the flood prevention work. The county magistrate of Jiaocheng County, the county party committee personally went into the water, leading the workers to rush to plug the breach in the Grand Canal overnight. Strong cadres were assigned to all flood prevention command organizations. Flood prevention preparations were also relatively thorough and serious. Generally, work such as signing tests, finding water seepage points, blocking road openings, repairing defects, and building earth levees was carried out. In the marginal areas, armed forces actively operated to protect the dikes and foiled the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conspiracy to breach the dikes and release water on a large scale. There were still many shortcomings in last year's flood prevention work, such as the publicity work was not widespread and in-depth enough, and many people did not realize the importance of flood prevention, and thus failed to consciously defend; the permanent flood workers were not all in place until the end of July; the work of the permanent flood workers during the defense period lacked organized arrangements, supervision, and inspection; and the integration of flood prevention and production was also very poor. Because there were no major floods last year, some cadres developed a sense of complacency. If this sense of complacency is not completely eliminated, it will affect this year's flood prevention work and even suffer unnecessary losses. He said: This year, after the land reform, the crops are better than last year. The Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits are constantly plotting to breach the dikes and release water, and the hidden reactionaries in the interior may also carry out various sabotage activities. In order to protect the interests of the people, we must never paralyze ourselves with last year's situation. In certain areas and at certain times, flood prevention work should become the most important work. This year, the dikes of the rivers in the central area have not undergone major projects, so we must make strong defenses during the flood season. Due to the disturbance of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, some river works in the marginal areas have not been repaired at all or have not been repaired well. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits have been constantly breaching the dikes and releasing water. In places such as Mazhuang in Qing County, they closed the Jiuxuan Sluice of the Grand Canal and built dams across the river in an attempt to flood our upstream villages. In the Yibao area of Jinghai, they breached the Ziya River fort and closed the Babao (Jinghai) Sluice, plotting to flood the Maikouwa and Taifengwa areas. These all show that this year's flood prevention work, in addition to fighting against nature, must also fight against the floods created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Therefore, all localities must mobilize the masses and actively carry out flood prevention work. The main thing is to mobilize cadres and the masses to jointly defend, and strictly enforce organization and discipline, emphasize responsibility at each level, and hold those who neglect flood prevention and cause disasters accountable. During the flood season, upstream and downstream, left bank and right bank are most likely to have conflicts of interest. We must educate the masses to proceed from the overall situation, with small interests subordinate to large interests, immediate interests subordinate to long-term interests, and partial interests subordinate to the whole. We must correct departmentalism and minimize the disaster area as much as possible. For the convenience of command, a flood prevention headquarters will be set up for each river system to be responsible for leading the flood prevention work of the river system; a county flood prevention headquarters and office will be set up below, and a village will organize a rescue team. During the defense period, we must organize the flood workers and dike patrolmen well, constantly carry out signing tests, inspections, earthwork reinforcement, and repair tools at any time. While not affecting the defense work, we must also organize flood workers to produce themselves and the masses to produce. In the future, we must carry out the flood prevention and field protection campaign, regularly evaluate merits, record merits, and reward those who actively defend and criticize or punish those who neglect defense.\n\nJizhong News: After the closing of the Jizhong flood prevention meeting, the eighth district convened a flood prevention meeting on the 26th to study the instructions of the Jizhong flood prevention meeting. It was proposed that the marginal areas should focus on armed dike protection, carry out political offensive, expose the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in destroying the dikes, and mobilize the masses to arm themselves for flood prevention. It was also decided to establish flood prevention headquarters in the Ziya River, the Grand Canal, and the Daqing River, with offices set up in each district along the river, and five to six dike patrol posts set up below. In addition to the local armed forces being equipped for dike protection, a large number of militiamen were also organized to prepare for armed dike protection.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服侥幸心理严防蒋匪破坏  冀中布置防汛护堤\n\n1948-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　克服侥幸心理严防蒋匪破坏\n    冀中布置防汛护堤\n    【冀中讯】雨季将到，伏汛即来，冀中行署特于六月十三日召开防汛会议，检讨去年防汛工作，研究今后防汛办法。工务局郝局长在会上作了报告，指出：去年除蒋匪在大清河、运河决堤制造水灾外，其他各河都没决口干部群众曾日夜加紧防汛、八、九、十等区专员及饶阳等县县长，亲自上堤巡视检查，领导防汛工作。交河县长，县委亲自下水，领导民工星夜抢堵运河决口。各防汛指挥机构中，都配备了坚强干部。防汛准备也较确实认真，一般的均进行了签试、水眼、填堵道口、修补残缺、增筑土牛等工作。在边缘地区，武装积极活动，保护堤防，粉碎了蒋匪大举决堤放水的阴谋。在去年防汛工作上，仍有不少缺点，如宣传工作不够普遍深入，不少群众没认识到防汛的重要，因而未能自觉的防守；常备汛工直到七月底还没上齐；对常备汛工防守期间的工作，缺乏有组织的布置、督促与检查；防汛与生产结合也很差。由于去年未发大水，某些干部发生了侥幸心理，这种侥幸心理如不彻底去掉，将影响今年的防汛工作，甚至遭到不应有的损失。他说：今年土改后，庄稼比去年好，蒋傅匪时刻阴谋扒堤放水，内地潜藏的反动分子也可能进行各种破坏。为保护人民利益，绝不能拿去年情况麻痹自己。在一定地区，一定时间，防汛工作应成为第一件重要工作。今年中心区各河堤防都未做大的工程，因此必须在汛期做有力的防守。边缘区河工因蒋匪扰乱，有的根本未修或修的不好。蒋匪不断决堤放水，在青县马庄等地，关闭了运河的九宣闸，并拦河打坝，企图泛滥我上游村庄。在静海一堡一带扒开子牙河堡、关闭八堡（静海）闸，阴谋水淹买口洼、台凤洼等地。这些都说明今年的防汛工作，除与自然斗争外，还要与蒋匪制造的泛滥作斗争。因此，各地必须发动群众，积极进行防汛工作。主要的还是发动干部、群众共同防守，并严格组织性、纪律性、强调逐级负责，对因忽视防汛发生灾害者，要追究责任。防汛期间，上游与下游，左岸与右岸最易发生利害矛盾，必须教育群众，从整体出发，小利服从大利，目前利益服从长远利益，局部服从全体。要纠正本位主义思想，尽量缩小受灾面积。为便于指挥，各河系设防汛期指挥部，负责领导本河系的防汛工作；下设县防汛指挥部、办事处，村组织抢险队。防守期间，要很好把汛工及巡堤员组织起来，不断的进行签试、检查、、培土牛等工作，并随时修理工具。在不影响防守工作下，还要组织汛工自己生产及群众生产，今后要开展防汛保田立功运动，定期评功、记功，对积极防守者予以奖励，对疏忽防守者予以批评或处分。\n    【又讯】冀中防汛会议闭幕后，八分区于二十六日召开防汛会议，研究冀中防汛会议上的指示。提出：边缘区应以武装护堤为主，开展政攻，揭露蒋匪破坏堤防罪行，发动群众武装防汛。并决定在子牙河、运河、大清河建立防汛指挥部，沿河各区设办事处，下设五个至六个看堤巡铺。除地方武装配备护堤外，并组织了大批民兵准备武装护堤。"

The experimental factory, which was converted from the former puppet Manchurian gas factory, resumed operations in July last year. Currently, the number of employees has increased nearly sevenfold compared to the start of operations, and gas production has increased by a quarter compared to the puppet Manchurian period. The scope of gas transmission and the number of factory and civilian users are also increasing daily. The factory has also added chemical and machinery departments, and plans to establish five fractionation departments in the gas partial distillation plant. The first fractionation department has already begun to extract heavy oil, light oil, medium oil, and asphalt from the gas by-product coal tar. The remaining four fractionation departments are being actively installed and are expected to start operations in September. The chemical department was established this spring and can now produce large quantities of raw materials for sulfur dyes every month. The machinery department was established in September last year and created a mining drill, which has been adopted by various departments. In the past, Harbin's rubber products were all supplied by South Manchuria. Over the past two years, through continuous construction and improvement, the rubber industry has been able to produce large quantities of rubber shoes. The cost has gradually decreased compared to the initial stage. In January last year, Rubber Shoe Factory No. 1 required 3.5 square feet of cloth per pair of shoes, but now only requires 2.95 square feet, and the quality has also improved. Since the rubber shoe factory affiliated to the Chemical Industry Cooperative started manufacturing rubber shoe soles in April this year, the daily output has increased fourfold compared to the initial stage. Technicians Tong Duofu, Jiang Shijiang, and others have also researched and successfully trial-produced regenerated rubber materials using the alkali method, which can be produced in large quantities soon. In addition, the wire factory and chemical bowl factory have also been producing large quantities of products since they started operations half a year ago, supplying military and civilian needs.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服原料技术困难　哈市新兴企业发展\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　克服原料技术困难\n    哈市新兴企业发展\n    【新华社东北十一日电】哈尔滨市新兴的瓦斯（煤气）、胶皮鞋、电线、及化学碗（电木碗）制造厂等公营企业，半年来克服原料和技术上的困难，已建立初步规模，由原伪满瓦斯工厂改成的实验工厂，去年七月复工后，目前职工已较开工时增加近七倍，瓦斯产量较伪满时期增加四分之一。瓦斯输送范围与工厂市民用户也逐日增加。该厂并增设化学、机器两部，另在瓦斯部分馏厂计划设立五个分馏部。第一分馏部已开始从瓦斯副产品煤焦油中提炼重油、轻油、中油、沥青等。其余四个分馏部正在积极装置，九月间即可开工。化学部于今春成立，现每月可出产大量硫化染料原料。机器部于去年九月成立，曾创制采矿钻，已为各部采用。哈市过去胶皮产品皆由南满供给。两年来胶皮工业，经过不断的建设和改进，已可制出大批胶皮鞋，成本较初创时逐渐减低，胶鞋一厂去年一月每双鞋需布三点五方尺，现仅需二点九五方尺，质量亦较前提高。化学工业社所属胶鞋厂自今年四月开工制造胶皮鞋掌以来，日产量较初期已增加四倍。该厂技师佟多福、姜世骧等并研究以碱法自制更生胶皮料子，已试制成功，即可大量制造。此外，电线工厂、化学碗制造厂自半年前开工以来，亦已大量出品，供给军需民用。"

    "content": "Jiluyu News: The Eighth Administrative Office of Jiluyu has decided to take advantage of the slack season between the completion of hoeing large seedlings and before the planting of small seedlings to intensify river dredging and prevent disasters. The region has rivers such as the Majia River, Wei River, Zhulong River, and Nei Xiao River, which have historically been prone to flooding. Last year, in order to expand the wheat planting area, river dredging and water diversion were carried out, but due to the vastness of the project, it could not be completed in the short term. Only [unclear code] had 1,000 hectares of land flooded and unable to be planted with wheat. This year, the masses unanimously requested to dredge and repair the rivers. The Construction Section of our Eighth Administrative Office specially convened a meeting of the construction sections of relevant counties to discuss and resolve: (1) This year's river dredging will basically still adopt the dredging method. Due to the limitation of manpower, materials, and time, it is not appropriate to engage in large-scale efforts. There is also no uniform regulation on when to start construction together or a deadline for completion. Instead, it should be combined with other work. Whichever place is ready first will start construction first, and it is best to seize the gap before the rainy season to complete it. (2) It is determined to first focus on the main streams, namely the Majia River and Zhulong River. As for the tributaries of each county, they can be tackled in the second step. (3) The distribution of the mainstream project is determined according to the size of the project in each county and the burden of strength. The area where the county borders with the county should be excavated first, to avoid the recurrence of the two counties relying on each other, failing to excavate properly, and thus causing disasters. (4) Food issue: The mainstream will be subsidized by the government. The tributaries will in principle be raised by the village itself. However, if the masses are truly in difficulty, the government can also subsidize a part. (5) Combine river dredging with other work. In villages where the masses urgently request river dredging, reduce or suspend unnecessary mass meetings during wheat requisition work in order to strive for an early start of construction.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫八专署决定办法  利用农隙浚河防灾\n\n1948-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫八专署决定办法\n    利用农隙浚河防灾\n    【冀鲁豫讯】八专署决定趁大苗已锄完、小苗尚未下种的空隙，加紧疏浚河道，以防灾患。该区共有马颊河、卫河、潴龙河、内硝河等河，历年常闹水灾。去年为扩大种麦面积，曾挖河疏水，但因工程浩大，短期无法完工。只××（电码不清）即有一千顷地被水淹没，未能种上麦子。今年群众一致要求浚修河流。我八专署建设科特召集有关各县建设科开会商讨，议决：（一）今年挖河基本上仍是采用浚修办法，由于人力物力及时间的限制，不宜轰轰烈烈大搞，在时间上也不统一规定一齐动工，或限期完成，而是结合其他工作，那里先准备好那里先动工，最好在雨季前抓紧空隙完成。（二）确定首先搞主流即马颊河和潴龙河。至于各县之支河可以第二步搞。（三）主流工程分配，根据各县工程大小，力量负担的轻重来确定。应先将县与县交界地方挖好，免蹈两县互相依赖，都挖不好，因而成灾的复辙。（四）粮食问题：主流由政府补助一部。支流原则上由村自筹。但群众真正困难者，政府也可补助一部。（五）挖河与其他工作结合，在群众迫切要求挖河的村庄，麦征工作中要少开或停开不必要的群众会，以便争取早日动工。"

    "content": "North Yue Agricultural and Forestry Department Proposes:\nPay Attention to Protecting Livestock\n\n[This newspaper reported] The North Yue Agricultural and Forestry Department pointed out that in some areas of North Yue, the number of draught cattle is declining rapidly, which should be taken seriously. Livestock is very scarce in various parts of North Yue, and in order to increase production, a large number of purchases need to be added. However, in many areas, the number of livestock has not only not increased, but has decreased instead. There are several reasons for this: (1) During the land reform, some draught animals were transferred from the hands of landlords and rich peasants to the hands of peasants, and peasants bought some more with extra income. Some of these draught animals were not distributed in time and were raised collectively by farmers' associations or draught animal cooperatives. Because individual ownership was not finally determined, some people did not care for and cherish the livestock very much, only caring about using them and not feeding them. Many livestock became thin and sick. Many died as well. According to incomplete statistics, in Changzhen Village, Wutai, one cow, one mule, and eight donkeys died in this way. As for the sick and thin ones, there were still more. In Youzhai, Yujiazhai, Jiren, and Emao villages in Yanggao, one mule, one horse, two cows, and two donkeys also died. (2) In Dingxiang in recent years, the leadership has emphasized large-scale water and dry land mutual aid (villages with water fields plant early and use the livestock from dry lands to help with planting, and when it is time to plant in dry lands, the livestock from water fields come to help). Because the wages for draught animals fixed by the public are very low, the livestock owners are not satisfied and have little interest in raising livestock. Some people rely solely on large-scale water and dry land mutual aid to solve the livestock problem and do not try to add to the numbers by buying (all those that do not adhere to the principles of equal exchange and voluntary combination will inevitably fail – Editor). At the production conference in Lingqiu this April, when discussing the issue of regulating animal power, it was advocated to use the method of “borrowing in spring and returning in autumn” to \"mobilize\" middle peasants to sell their labor, and if necessary, to use the method of assigning chores to help households solve the problem of spring plowing. In Liujia Village, Yu County, during the spring plowing, middle peasants were forced to organize their livestock into groups, causing some middle peasants to say: \"Whoever has grass and fodder can take them to use.\" (3) Some cooperatives are established by the masses through pooled shares to buy some draught animals, which are hired by poor households and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who are poor and lack labor (the price may be lower). Poor management also affects the preservation and increase of livestock. The Gengniu (耕牛) cooperative in Shanyao Village, Hunyuan County, uses the method of selling cattle to feed cattle (that is, using the money from selling livestock to pay for the food for people and animals), and out of a total of twenty-eight livestock, less than ten are left. The Agricultural and Forestry Department pointed out that the above-mentioned phenomena deserve serious attention and hopes to attract the attention of all parties, immediately take effective steps, and study ways to overcome and solve the problems.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳农林厅提出  注意保护牲口\n\n1948-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳农林厅提出\n    注意保护牲口\n    【本报讯】北岳农林厅提出：北岳有些地区，耕牛在迅速灭退，应引起严重注意。北岳各地牲畜很缺，为了增加生产，需要大批增添购买。但不少地区的牲口不但没增加，反而减少了，考察原因有几个：（一）在土改中，有一部耕畜从地主富农手中转移到农民手中，农民们用浮财又购买了一部分。这些耕畜有些没有及时分配，由农会或耕畜合作社集体喂起来。因为个人的所有权没有最后确定，有些人对牲口关心爱护很差，只管使用，不管喂养。有不少牲口瘦了，病了。死的也不少，据不完全的统计，五台长畛村就这样死了牛一头，骡一头，驴八头。至于病的瘦的还有。阳高尤宅、于家寨、集仁、鹅毛等村，也死了骡一头，马一匹，牛两头，驴两头。（二）定襄几年来，领导上强调水旱大变工（水地村庄种的早，把旱地的牲口拉去帮助下种，到旱地下种时，水地的牲口又来帮助），因公定的耕畜工资很低，畜主便不满意，对养牲畜兴趣不大。有些人专靠水旱大变工来解放牲畜问题，也不设法添买（凡属不遵守等价交换，自愿结合原则的，没有不失败的——编者）。灵今年四月生产会议上，谈到调剂畜力的问题，主张用春借秋还的办法“动员”中农出卖畜工，必要时可用派勤务的办法帮管户解决春耕问题。盂县刘家村春耕时，强制中农的牲畜编组，使得有些中农说：“谁有草料谁拉去使吧”。（三）有些社的性质，由群众集股设立，买一部耕畜，由贫苦户及贫苦无劳力军工烈属雇用，价钱可能低些。）管理不善，也影响了牲口的保存与增加。浑源山尧村耕牛社靠卖牛喂牛（就是以卖牲口的款，开支人畜的食用）的办法开支，总共二十八头牲口现已卖的不到十头了。农林厅提出上述这些值得严重注意的现象，希望引起各方面的注意，立即采取有效步骤，研究克服解决的办法。"

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's crime of selling Hainan Island's sovereignty to the United States has aroused strong protests from the people of Hainan Island. According to an Agence France-Presse report from Hong Kong: Two hundred Hainan Islanders in Hong Kong issued a declaration on the 9th, protesting \"American attempts to gain control of Hainan Island.\" The declaration revealed: The United States recently suggested to the Chinese government that they jointly manage and develop Hainan Island, turning it into a major air and naval base. The declaration stated: Apart from North China (Agence France-Presse note: possibly referring to the Communist-controlled areas), Central China under the government's control, especially Qingdao and Taiwan, have already been taken over by the United States. The declaration firmly stated: \"We will fight to the end against ceding any inch of Taiwan or Hainan Island to the United States.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on June 5th, a special dispatch from Nanjing revealed: American imperialism has \"informally\" proposed to the Chiang government to use Hainan Island as an American naval base. The dispatch stated: \"Reliable information has been obtained here: Hainan Island will become the main focus of American military aid to China. A senior military official revealed that the American side has proposed to our government that we jointly use Hainan Island as a naval base for both sides,\" and stated: \"It is said that the construction of Hainan Island has always been of concern to the United States.\" Because \"strategically speaking, the island, along with the Philippines and Taiwan, forms a triangle, and if used properly, it can control the entire Nanyang.\" Since Weidmeier's visit to China last July, Yulin Port on Hainan Island has been sold by Chiang Kai-shek to American imperialism. The fishing and iron ore rights of Hainan Island have also been successively controlled by the United States. In March and April of this year, Japanese war criminals who invaded China, such as Horiuchi Kansei, Japanese financial magnate Yamada Tadashi, and Japanese nationals Takeuchi Kengo, Kinrai Yoichi, and Okada Genzo, were successively sent to Hainan Island to assist the United States in developing the island. In mid-April of this year, US Ambassador Stuart and the head of the US military advisory group, Badavi, went to Hainan Island to \"inspect the military and political situation,\" further confirming the plan to use Hainan Island as an American naval base and Chiang army training base.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对出卖海南岛　旅港海南岛人士发表宣言\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对出卖海南岛\n    旅港海南岛人士发表宣言\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋介石匪帮向美国出卖海南岛主权的罪行，已引起海南岛人民的强烈抗议。据法新社香港讯：旅港海南岛人士二百人于九日发表宣言，抗议“美国企图取得海南岛控制权”。宣言揭露：美国最近曾向中国政府建议共同管理海南岛，并开发海南岛，使之成为一个空军和海军大基地。宣言说：除了华北（法新社按可能指共产党地区）之外，政府控制下的华中，特别是青岛和台湾，已为美国接管。宣言坚决表示：“我们将为反对割让台湾或海南岛任何一寸土地给美国而奋斗到底”。\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】据六月五日天津益世报载该报南京专电披露：美帝国主义已向蒋政府“非正式”提出以海南岛作为美国海军根据地。该电称：“此间顷获得确息：海南岛将成为美国军事援华中之主要着眼点。军方某高级人士透露，美方已向我国政府提出将共同使用海南岛为双方之海军根据地”，并称：“闻海南岛建设始终为美国所注意”。因为“在战略上看来，该岛与菲律宾台湾恰为一三角形，如运用适宜，实能控制整个南洋”。按自去年七月魏德迈来华后，海南岛的榆林港即被蒋介石出卖给美帝国主义，海南岛之渔业和铁矿权也相继由美国控制，今年三、四月间日本侵华战犯崛内干城，日财阀山田忠及日人竹内健吾、进来要一、冈田源仓等相继被派到海南岛协助美国开发该岛。今年四月中旬，美大使司徒雷登与美国军事顾问团团长巴大维赴海南岛“视察军事与政治情况”，更进一步确定了以海南岛作为美国海军根据地和蒋军训练基地的计划。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. The Harbin Railway Bureau's Locomotive Depot is currently conducting focused inspections of its operations to rectify labor organization and production management. Preliminary inspections have revealed that the past emphasis on completing crash tasks has severely affected regular production efficiency. First, the division of labor among cadres is unclear, leading to lax work by foremen in various departments, while the主任 (zhǔrèn - director/chief) is constantly busy, bogged down in事务主义 (shìwùzhǔyì -事務主義; routinism/engrossed in administrative trifles), unable to understand the situation below, and unable to achieve results despite their busyness. The Transportation Office of the depot has eleven locomotive engineers and instructor drivers. The tasks of the locomotive engineers and instructor drivers are not clearly defined. When problems arise, they are pushed upwards, or everyone is busy together, \"busy without producing results.\" Second, labor organization and utilization are inappropriate. For example, the repair factory has seven teams for A, B, and C level overhaul, with too many teams and too few locomotives. Sometimes there are no locomotives to \"inspect,\" and the workload is uneven. A total of 330 people are directly involved in overhaul. If each person works 25 days per month, they should produce a total of 8,250 work-days. However, according to March statistics, only 4,010 work-days were completed. Third, there is no strict inspection of product quality. In early June, two locomotives developed problems during trial runs. One malfunctioned due to careless installation of the axle, and the other had incorrectly installed parts. An inspection of the mechanical equipment revealed that 21 out of 51 large machines had problems, and five were damaged. Given the depot's existing conditions, the vast majority of these 26 machines could be repaired. These problems are the result of the工务室 (gōngwùshì - engineering office) not inspecting finished products, with even defective products being used. Fourth, the statistical and registration system is unsound. In the factory's work-hour records, there are many omissions and errors. There are no detailed records of how much material the warehouse issues or how many finished products the factory produces. The reporting system is unsound, affecting the inaccurate statistics of train mileage. Other shortcomings exist in technical leadership. For example, the technical office has not truly functioned as the technical assistant to the depot chief. After discovering these problems, the locomotive depot is further conducting in-depth inspections and organizing employee tour groups to visit other depots. It is also organizing grassroots cadres, activists, and heroes to lead and motivate all employees to develop improvement plans based on the identified shortcomings.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哈市铁路局机务段　检查业务改进管理  过去偏重突击损害经常生产工日浪费成品缺乏严格检查\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哈市铁路局机务段\n    检查业务改进管理\n    过去偏重突击损害经常生产工日浪费成品缺乏严格检查\n    【新华社东北九日电】哈尔滨铁路局机务段为整顿劳动组织与生产管理工作，现正有重点的检查业务。在初步检查中，已发现由于过去偏重完成突击任务，严重地影响了经常的生产效率。第一是干部分工不明确，因此各部门工长的工作松懈，而主任则整日忙碌不堪，陷于事务主义，不了解下情，忙不出成绩来。该段运转室有机务员与指导司机十一人。机务员与指导司机的任务都不明确，遇事往上推，或者大家乱忙一起，“忙不出活来”，第二是劳动力组织与使用上不恰当。如修理工厂有甲、乙、丙三种检组修共七个组，组多车少，有时无车可“检”，工作也忙闲不一致。全厂用于直接检修的共三百三十人，如每人每月以工作二十五日计，应共作八千二百五十个工日，但据三月份统计，只作了四千零十个工日。第三是成品质量没有严格的检查。六月初有两辆机车在试验行驶中出了毛病，一辆是因车轴安装得不够仔细而发生故障，一辆把车上的零件安装错了。在检查机械装置中发现五十一部大型机器中有毛病的就占了二十一部，破损了的有五部。根据该机务段的现有条件，这二十六部机器绝大部分是可以修好的。这些都是由于工务室对成品没有检查的结果，甚至有些坏的成品也照样拿去使用。第四是统计、登记制度不健全。工厂的工时登记中，漏记和误写的不少。仓库发出多少材料，交工厂做出多少成品也没有详细帐目。报告制度不健全，影响火车行驶里程统计不精确。其他如技术领导上，也有若干缺点。如技术室没有真正发挥作为段长的技术助手的作用。该机务段发现这些问题后，正进一步作深入检查，并组织员工参观团到其他段参观；组织基层干部、积极分子、功臣等带领推动全体员工，根据已检查出的缺点订出改进计划。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that the fishing and aggressive activities of Japanese fishing boats in China's territorial waters are becoming increasingly rampant. According to Central News Agency dispatches: From May 19th to mid-June of this year, in less than a month, more than 20 Japanese fishing vessels were discovered in Chinese waters. The intrusion of Japanese fishing boats into Chinese territorial waters for fishing is a planned action by the Japanese authorities and is directly instigated by MacArthur. According to the Tianjin Yishibao: Crew members of the Japanese fishing vessels \"Unzen Maru\" No. 21 and No. 22, belonging to the Japanese \"Kawaminami Fisheries Industry Co., Ltd.,\" which were fishing in Zhejiang waters on May 19th, confessed: \"The fishing boats came to China under the orders of Kawaminami Co., Ltd., and will report the longitude, latitude, and measured seawater depth to the Japanese authorities every so often.\" Furthermore, on May 3rd, the Tianjin Xin Xing Daily translated and published an article from the Japanese press openly recounting the story of a Japanese fishing boat, the \"Akashi Maru,\" crossing the border to fish a year earlier. The article wrote: \"April 7, 1947, was the eve of our maiden voyage. Captain Ko-han presided over a gathering ceremony for all crew members. He announced that our ship would sail directly to China tomorrow, because the fishing work in that sea area has been permitted by headquarters (referring to MacArthur's headquarters).\"\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that many of the Japanese fishing vessels that come to China for fishing are converted from Japanese naval ships. For example, the aforementioned Japanese fishing vessel \"Akashi Maru\" was repaired and converted from a small Japanese warship that was damaged during the war of aggression against China. The Xin Xing Daily translation stated: After a detailed inspection by American inspectors, they \"believed that this was simply a gunboat, with thickened steel plates in the engine room, and the seven torpedo guns were considered military ordnance for combat,\" but MacArthur's headquarters \"finally signed a permit\" for the ship. Furthermore, according to a Central News Agency dispatch, the 25 crew members of the two Japanese fishing boats fishing in Zhejiang waters on May 19th stated: \"The Japanese crew members are all wearing military uniforms, are skilled in military movements, and a commemorative badge was found on their bodies, with the words 'Japan-China Incident Commemoration 1937 Ishimatsu Team'. Unzen Maru No. 22 may have been converted from a gunboat.\" The Beiping News reported on May 26th: \"In the future, this group of people can easily become the vanguard of a real-gun, real-knife landing.\"\n\nThe Jiang government, with the breath of MacArthur, does everything possible to cover up and give preferential treatment to the Japanese aggressors. The Beiping Xinmin Daily revealed: The Jiang government's policy towards Japanese fishing boats that intrude into our territorial waters is \"only to confiscate their fishing gear, and the personnel are sent to MacArthur's headquarters for handling. What is the value of the fishing gear? Can it compensate for the loss of a country's sovereignty?\" A Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on June 3rd even admitted: The Jiang government authorities adopt a so-called \"lenient treatment\" attitude towards Japanese fishing boats that violate Chinese sovereignty. In fact, in May 1946, the Jiang government and MacArthur reached an agreement to sell China's fishing rights to Japan, allowing 40 Japanese fishing boats to fish in the so-called \"high seas\" (the waters beyond three nautical miles from the coast are called \"high seas\", so it is actually the Chinese coast) between China and Japan for one year, which has already opened up a \"legal\" path for Japanese fishing boats to invade China.\n\nMany signs indicate that Japan's aggression against China's fishing rights will intensify in the future. At the Shanghai \"Japan Issues\" symposium convened by the Shanghai Dagongbao on June 10th, Lu Yanghao of the Southeast Fisheries Company pointed out: \"Before the war, Japanese fishing boats had squeezed the Chinese fishing industry to the point of suffocation.\" \"MacArthur has recently allowed Japan to retain more than 150,000 tons of fishing boats and has ordered a fishing industry plan from 1948 to 1952, preparing to build another 2.7 million tons of motorized fishing boats. Won't so many ships all come to China to fish in the future?!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 在美帝包庇指使下　日本渔船猖狂侵华\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　在美帝包庇指使下\n    日本渔船猖狂侵华\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合各方消息：日本渔船在中国领海的捕鱼侵略活动日益猖獗。据中央社电讯连续披露：从今年五月十九日至六月中旬不到一个月的时间中，在中国海面发现之日本渔轮即达二十余艘。日本渔船侵越中国领海捕鱼系日本当局有计划之行动，且为麦克阿瑟所直接指使。据天津益世报载：五月十九日在浙江海面捕鱼的属于日本“川南水产工业株式会社”之“云仙丸”第二十一号和第二十二号两日本渔轮船员供认：“渔轮来华系奉川南株式会社之命，每行若干时即将经纬度和所测海水深度报告日当局”。另五月三日天津新星报曾从日本报刊译载过一篇公开记述一年以前一只日本渔船“明石丸”号越界捕鱼故事的文章，该文写道：一九四七年“四月七日，是我们举行处女航的前夕，船长小藩先生主持了全体船员的集会典礼，他在席上宣布明天我们的船将直驶中国。因为该处海面的捕鱼工作已经得总部（指麦克阿瑟总部）的许可”。\n    尤可注意者，来华捕鱼之日本渔轮不少且系日本海军舰只改装而成，例如上述日渔轮“明石丸”即系侵华战争期间被炸伤的一艘小型日本军舰修装而成的。新星报译文记载：美国检验官详细勘查之后亦“认为这简直是一艘炮舰，机关室加厚着钢板，七门鱼炮被认为是作战用的军械”，但麦克阿瑟总部对该船却“终于签署了许可证”。另据中央社电讯描述五月十九日在浙江海面捕鱼之两日本渔船二十五名船员称：“日船员均着军服，娴习军事动作，自彼等身上搜出一纪念章，有‘日支事变纪念一九三七石松队’字样，云仙丸第二十二号可能为炮艇所改装。”五月二十六日北平新闻报载文指出：“未来这批人正可以驾轻就熟，成为真枪真刀的登陆先锋。”\n    蒋政府对于日人之侵略行动，则仰承麦克阿瑟鼻息，极尽包庇优容之能事。北平新民报揭露：蒋政府对侵入我领海的日本渔船，“只是没收它的渔具，人员则解送麦克阿瑟总部办理。渔具所值几何？是不是能抵偿一国主权的损失？”中央社上海六月三日电更承认：蒋政府当局对侵犯中国主权的日渔船皆采所谓“宽大待遇”的优容态度。事实上，一九四六年五月间蒋政府与麦克阿瑟成立协定，将中国渔权出卖给日本允许日本渔船四十艘在中日间所谓“公海”（海岸三海里以外即称“公海”，故实即中国沿海）捕渔一年，即已为日本渔船打开了“合法”侵华的路子。\n    不少迹象表明日本对中国渔权之侵略，今后将会变本加厉。六月十日上海大公报召开之上海各界人士“日本问题”座谈会中，东南渔业公司陆养浩指出：“战前日本渔船曾把中国渔业压得透不过气来”。“麦帅最近更许日本保留渔轮十五万多顿，并订一九四八年至一九五二年渔业计划，准备再造二百七十万吨机器渔轮。那么多的船，将来还不是都开来中国捕鱼吗！？”"

    "content": "Taihang News: In recent months, all state-owned factories in Taihang have been striving to improve various policies in response to the call from the Central Bureau to increase production by even an inch. First and foremost, they are improving factory management and operations, and rectifying labor and wage policies. The outlook of all state-owned factories has undergone a transformation. To commemorate \"July 1st,\" all employees of a certain state-owned coal mine company in Taihang enthusiastically launched a production increase campaign. The slogan was put forward after the mine implemented a piece-rate wage system with the principle of \"more work, more pay\" on June 1st. The workers' enthusiasm and creativity have been universally enhanced, and output has generally increased. The implementation of the new standard in the ×× well yielded significant results within the first three days. The total output of coal miners increased by 14.2% above the standard output from the first day to the third day. Some even exceeded the standard output by 100%, creating the highest coal mining record since the company was founded. The new wage standard stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of Chen Chengli, a miner from Well No. 12. He exceeded the standard output, and his wage increased to 17.5 jin of millet per shift (previously, the fixed wage was 16 jin and 10 liang). He said, \"In the past, the evaluation was unfair. It didn't matter how much you mined, it was always the same amount. The current method is very good.\" The car worker Wang Lin pulled 7 tons of coal in one shift, ranking first in the entire field. In one field, Yang Shungui, Pei Jizhi, Yang Jucai, and other four miners all exceeded the standard output by 50% to 70% due to their correct work attitude and careful study of technology. Pei Jizhi was originally a carpenter, but he was transferred to coal mining due to work needs. Initially, he could only reach 70% of the standard output, but he did not lose heart. He was determined to study and improve his skills. Now, he has increased his daily production to 114% of the standard output, and it has even reached 168% at the highest. Inspired by the new wage policy, the workers in various departments of the power plant also completed their tasks ahead of schedule and strived to save raw materials. The mechanical workers manufactured a certain machine part, which originally required 167 work hours, but now only requires 137. The First Branch Plant repaired Machine No. 1, promoting democracy, and held discussions in advance, removing the past problem of simply pursuing speed but not repairing it well, which prevented the work from being completed smoothly and on time. As a result, from dismantling and hoisting to repairing and installing, it was completed four days ahead of schedule. The boiler department's firemen tried everything possible to save raw materials and reduce costs. After work every day, comrades like Wang Laishan went to the Engineering Section to inquire about their own and others' coal consumption and power generation, and recorded it in their notebooks, checking their own savings achievements day by day. The workers launched a competition to save raw materials and created many methods. For example, when coal dust leaked into the furnace, it would run out of the chimney before it could burn, resulting in high coal consumption and low power generation. Later, they developed a method of sprinkling water before burning, which not only saved coal but also maintained the pressure at 90 to 100 degrees. The improvement of firing technology greatly saved raw materials. The coal ash that was dug out has changed from gray to white, and there are very few coal slags. After education, the stonemasons have generally changed their old habit of \"dragging their feet\" and launched a production increase campaign to improve work efficiency and strive to exceed the standard. Within 20 days, the average output of stonemasons has increased from two square feet to four square feet, and 14 production models such as Wang Huaide have emerged.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行某煤矿按件计资　产量提高成本降低\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行某煤矿按件计资\n    产量提高成本降低\n    【太行讯】数月来，太行各公营工厂，为响应中央局所提把生产提高一寸的号召，努力端正各种政策，首先改善工厂管理经营方法，端正工运工资政策，各公营工厂面貌，均为之改观。公营某煤矿公司全体职工为纪念“七一”，热烈展开增产竞赛运动。该矿自六月一日实行了按件计资、多劳多得的工资标准后，即提出这个口号。工人生产积极性与创造性普遍提高，产量普遍增加。××井在实行新标准的头三天，即收到很大效果。挖煤工人总产量从第一天到第三天，提高标准产量百分之十四点二，有的甚至已超过标准产量的一倍，创造了公司开办以来挖煤的最高纪录。新工资标准启发了十二号井矿工陈成礼的积极性和创造性，他超过了标准产量，工资增加到每班十七斤半小米（过去固定工资十六斤十两）。他说：“过去评分不公，不管挖多挖少都是那么多，现在的办法很好”。车工王林作到一班拉煤七吨，为全场第一。一场杨双贵、裴计只、杨聚财等四个矿工，由于劳动态度正确，细心研究技术，均超过标准产量百分之五十至七十。裴计只原是个木工，后因工作需要调他挖煤，开始只能达到标准数的百分之七十，但他不灰心，决心研究改进技术，现在已提高到每天生产标准产量百分之一百一十四，最高时曾达到百分之一百六十八。发电厂各部工人也在新工资政策鼓舞下，提前完成任务，并努力节省原料。机务工人制造某种机器零件，原需一百六十七个工，现只用一百三十七个。一分厂修理一号机器，发扬了民主，事先作了讨论，去掉了过去单纯图快而修不好，使工作不能顺利按时完成的毛病。结果从拆吊到修理按装，提前四天完成。锅炉部烧火工人想尽一切方法节省原料，减低成本。王来善等同志每天下班后就到工务股打听自己和别人的烧煤数与发电量，并把他记到本子上，逐日检查自己的节约成绩。工人们为了节省原料展开竞赛，创造了许多办法，如煤面漏入炉内，来不及燃烧便从烟筒跑了，烧的多而发电量少，后来便研究出先洒上水再烧，不但节省煤，而且保持气压经常在九十度至一百度。烧火技术的改进大大节省了原料，挖出的煤灰已由过去的灰色变成白色，炭渣也就很少见到了。石工经过教育后，已普遍改变了过去“磨洋工”的旧习气，展开了提高工作效率，为超过标准而努力的增产运动，在二十天内，琢石料工人平均已由二方尺增至四方尺，涌现出王怀德等十四位生产模范。"

The inspection of the Harbin Railway Bureau's locomotive depot shows us that sound labor organization and enterprise management can bring order to factories, properly allocate employees and machines, and greatly improve work efficiency during continuous production. Conversely, if the leadership lacks unified planning for overall operations and the responsibilities of staff members are unclear, the factory will not operate as precisely as a clock. These problems are not unique to this locomotive depot; they are common, to varying degrees, in other enterprise departments as well, because the scientific management of enterprises is still new to us, and a flexible and precise mechanism is still in the initial stages of exploration and establishment.\n\n深入业务整顿劳动组织是一件不容易的事，但又是必须要做的工作。如哈市铁路局机务段那样，数一数工时，算一算材料，查一查成品，出了问题找根源，抽丝剥茧，逐渐清理，即可找出改进业务的头绪来。一套企业化的科学管理必须从小处下手，并且长久坚持下去。精密计算同样是有困难的。目前工厂的生产材料有些不爽手。但如果拿这个理由来做为“不能精密计算”的借口，那就错了。因为材料不爽手所造成的耗费究竟有多么大也还是可以计算出来的。\n\nDeeply understanding operations and rectifying labor organization is not an easy task, but it is a necessary one. Like the Harbin Railway Bureau's locomotive depot, count work hours, calculate materials, check finished products, find the root cause of problems, unravel them layer by layer, and gradually clean up, so that you can find clues to improve operations. A set of enterprise-based scientific management must start with small things and persist for a long time. Precise calculations are also difficult. Currently, some of the factory's production materials are not readily available. However, it is wrong to use this reason as an excuse for \"not being able to calculate precisely.\" Because the cost caused by the unavailability of materials can still be calculated.\n\n哈尔滨铁路局机务段所提出的问题，就是我们的企业部门在管理上应当前进一步的问题。希望各企业部门的领导机关吸取这一经验，在各单位里深入检查和改进业务，职工会对于这一工作，应该起积极保证作用。\n\nThe problems raised by the Harbin Railway Bureau's locomotive depot are the problems that our enterprise departments should take a step forward in management. It is hoped that the leading organs of various enterprise departments will learn from this experience, conduct in-depth inspections and improve operations in each unit, and that the trade unions should play an active guaranteeing role in this work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 工时材料成品都要精密核计　东北日报号召改进企业管理\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　工时材料成品都要精密核计\n    东北日报号召改进企业管理\n    【新华社东北九日电】东北日报顷以“在企业管理上前进一步”为题，对此次哈尔滨铁路局机务段检查机务中所发现的问题发表短评称：不深入业务便无法掌握现代企业，不健全劳动组织与企业管理就不会发挥更高的生产效率。没有精密核计，不做长远打算，就将阻碍国家企业的进步，以致造成损失。哈尔滨铁路局机务段的检查中告诉我们，劳动组织与企业管理的健全就能使工厂中秩序井然，员工和机器配置得当，就能在不断生产中大大提高工作效率。反之，如领导上对全盘业务缺乏统一的筹划，工作人员的任务不明确，就会使工厂不能象钟表一样准确的动作。这些问题不只是该机务段如此，在其他企业部门中也是普遍的或多或少存在着，因为企业的科学管理对我们还是新的事物，一套灵活的精密机构还在初步摸索和建立之中。\n    深入业务整顿劳动组织是一件不容易的事，但又是必须要做的工作。如哈市铁路局机务段那样，数一数工时，算一算材料，查一查成品，出了问题找根源，抽丝剥，逐渐清理，即可找出改进业务的头绪来。一套企业化的科学管理必须从小处下手，并且长久坚持下去。精密计算同样是有困难的。目前工厂的生产材料有些不爽手。但如果拿这个理由来做为“不能精密计算”的借口，那就错了。因为材料不爽手所造成的耗费究竟有多么大也还是可以计算出来的。\n    哈尔滨铁路局机务段所提出的问题，就是我们的企业部门在管理上应当前进一步的问题。希望各企业部门的领导机关吸取这一经验，在各单位里深入检查和改进业务，职工会对于这一工作，应该起积极保证作用。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee introduce experiences in drought-resistant planting and seedling protection.\n\n　　The dog days are coming, and planting has reached its final stage. Some areas have not yet been planted in wheat stubble fields due to drought. Most areas have already been planted due to sufficient spring rain, but small seedlings are showing signs of drought, and some are even dying in severely affected areas. Therefore, we should vigorously protect seedlings and organize emergency planting. Here are some experiences in fighting drought over the years for your reference.\n\n　　Technical experience:\n\n　　I. Drought-Resistant Planting\n\n　　(1) Carrying water for spot planting: First, use a harrow to fine the soil (without large clods), use a hoe to dig holes at certain plant and row spacing, pour water into them, and wait for the water to seep in. When it doesn't form a mud ball when you pinch it by hand, put the seeds in. In this way, the water is deep and the covering soil can be firm and dry slowly. The seeds should be soaked in warm water two days before spot planting, which will make them germinate and emerge twice as fast as dry planting. After spot planting, harrow again once the next night to make it more drought-resistant. (2) Dry land planting: If the distance from the water source is too far and there is really no way to carry water for spot planting, dry land planting can be used. Shallowly sow the seeds in dry land, and they can germinate after a light rain, which is much more reliable than turning the land after a light rain and then sowing. Even if there is a thorough rain, the seedlings will emerge several days earlier than sowing after the rain. \"A day's difference in spring is a ten-day difference in autumn,\" and the yield in autumn will also be very different. (3) Planting by furrow: Predict what crops to plant, and use a plow or drill to sow ditches according to the plant and row spacing of the crop, or use a hoe to dig holes. If there is a light rain, put the seeds in and level them with a harrow. Even if the rain is light, the seeds will be in wet soil above and below, ensuring germination. A light rain can be as good as a heavy rain. (4) Soil Moisture Preservation: If it rains lightly and there is no time to rush to plant, you can harrow the land that you are unable to plant at the moment to keep the humidity for a longer time. Another way to preserve moisture is to soak two-inch-long sorghum or corn stalks in water, put two or three roots in each hole when spot planting, and then water and put in the seeds to keep them from drying out for a longer time. (5) Finding moisture for planting: If the land is not deeply dry, but cannot be plowed, you can use a hoe to dig deep holes, turn out the wet soil, cover the seeds with wet soil above and below, and then level it with a harrow.\n\n　　II. Launching a Seedling Protection Campaign\n\n　　(1) The most common and easy way is to hoe more. As the saying goes, \"Hoeing in dry weather,\" \"The hoe has water.\" More hoeing makes the soil finer, and moisture does not evaporate easily, which can resist drought. Pay attention to the hoeing method: shallow hoeing is suitable for small seedlings to avoid hurting the roots. More roots are easier to absorb moisture. Hoe in the morning and evening, and do not hoe at noon, so as not to evaporate a lot of moisture when hoeing. (2) If the drought is more severe, the only way is to water. In order to use less water and get greater results, you can use a two-foot-long wooden stick with a diameter of about one inch, sharpened to a point, to insert a six- or seven-inch-deep hole next to the small seedlings (about two inches away), and pour water into it with a teapot. After the water seeps in, bury it with soil. Generally, 20 loads of water per mu can water the entire corn field. (3) After a light rain, rush to hoe the seedlings and cover the roots of the seedlings with a little soil, which can withstand the drought for a few more days. (4) Prevention and control of aphids (spider mites): Cotton and beans are prone to aphids in dry weather. The prevention and control method is also very simple: use one pound of white flour, five pounds of water, and mix it into a paste, then add seventy-five pounds of water, stir evenly, and sprinkle it on the leaves on a sunny day; or put a large bowl of slurry, bend the crops over and brush them, which saves slurry and is thorough.\n\n　　We should use the greatest strength to rationally organize spot planting, seedling protection, and drought resistance. There are also many experiences in organizational methods in various places:\n\n　　(1) The most important thing is that the leadership should pay attention and be vigilant, seize the urgent needs of the masses for drought resistance and seedling protection, overcome the paralysis and fluke mentality of relying on the sky for food and waiting for rain, and mobilize all labor (male and female, main and auxiliary labor) to participate in this struggle. It is necessary to rationally organize and use labor. Last year, in Neiqiu Chengguan, 95% of the men, women, old and young participated in spot planting; Wucun organized 21 mutual aid groups to dig wells during the day and spot planting under the moonlight. People were free, but the wells were not. The elderly dug holes, the young and middle-aged carried water, women poured water into the holes, and children put in seeds. In order to save labor, various types of labor should be properly allocated according to life needs, and the mutual free adjustment between groups should be promoted to maximize labor. (2) Rationally solve the problem of water use, which is more important in water-scarce areas. First, dig wells and springs to increase water sources. Second, in order to avoid wasting water, each group can separate water wells or pools according to the situation (it must be democratically decided fairly and reasonably), or agree on which groups will use water in the morning and which groups will use water in the afternoon to avoid everyone using water at the same time, so that the water is not enough and labor is wasted. (3) Rationally use tools. Last year, the 120 water buckets in Bao Huang Dahe Road Village were not enough. Six oil baskets, three wine baskets, and twelve large pots were all used, and more water buckets were purchased. Mutual adjustments were also made between groups.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会农林厅介绍  抗旱播种和保苗经验\n\n1948-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会农林厅介绍\n    抗旱播种和保苗经验\n    伏天将到，播种已达最后关头，有些地区因天旱不雨，麦茬地尚未播种。大部地区因春雨不缺，已经下种。但小苗已呈旱象，严重地区且有枯死现象。因此应该大力保苗，并组织抢种。兹介绍几点历年来和旱灾斗争的经验，供大家参考。\n    关于技术方面的经验：\n            一、抗旱下种\n    （１）担水点种：先用耙把地耙细（没有大坷垃），按一定的株距行距用＠头刨窝，倒进水去，等水渗完，到用手去捏不至成为泥块时，将种子投入。这样水阴的深，覆土亦可结实，干燥较慢。种子要在点种前两天用温水浸过，比干种发芽出土要快一倍时间。点种后过一夜再用耢（也有叫擦子的）耢一次，更加耐旱。（２）干地寄种：距水源太远，实在没法担水点种时，可以干地寄种。把种子浅浅的干耩上，如过小雨即可发芽，比小雨后翻一下地再耩有把握的多。就是下了透雨，也比雨后下种早出苗数日。“春差一日秋差十日”，秋后产量亦会相差很大。（３）接垧下种：预计种什么作物，皆按照这种作物的株行距距，用犁或耧耩下壕子，或用＠头刨下窝子。如遇小雨把种子投入，用耢耢平，雨虽小种子上下都是湿土，保险可以出苗，小雨可顶大雨用。（４）保垧：天下了小雨，一时又抢种不完时，可一面突击下种，一面把当下无力播种的地耢一下，湿度可多保持些时间。另一种保垧办法，是点种时把二寸长的高粱或玉茭杆用水浸透，每窝放二三根，然后浇水投入种子，可保持较长时间不旱。（５）找垧下种：如地干的还不深，但用犁耧耩不出来，可用＠头刨成深窝子，将湿土翻出，种子上下均复以湿土，再用耢耢平。\n            二、开展保苗斗争\n    （１）最普通易行的是多锄。俗话说：“天旱锄田”、“锄头有水”。多锄使土变细，湿气不易挥发，可以而旱。锄法上要注意：小苗宜浅锄，不要伤了根，根多易吸收潮气；要早晚锄，中午不要锄，免得锄的时候湿气大量挥发掉。（２）如旱的更历害了，唯一的办法是用水浇。为了用水少而收效大，可以二尺长直径约一寸的木棍，削成尖头，在小苗旁（约二寸许）插一个六七寸深的窟窿，用茶壶把水灌入。待水阴下去后，用土埋住。一般玉蜀黍每亩有二十担水即可浇完。（３）天下了小雨后，要突击锄苗，苗根覆点土，可多耐几天旱。（４）防除火龙（火蜘蛛）：天一旱棉花和豆子就要生火龙。防除办法也很简单：用白面一斤、水五斤，打成浆糊，再兑入七十五斤水，搅拌均匀，晴天时洒在叶上；或把浆糊汤盛上一大碗，把庄稼弯过来刷一刷，又省浆糊又周到。\n    应该以最大力量合理的组织点种保苗抗旱工作。组织办法各地也有不少经验：\n    （一）最主要的是领导上重视起来，警觉起来，抓紧群众抗旱保苗的迫切要求，克服靠天吃饭、等待落雨的麻痹侥幸心理，动员一切劳动力（男女主辅劳力）投入这个斗争，要合理的组织使用劳力，去年抗旱点种，内邱城关男女老少整半劳力百分之九十五参加点花；吴村组织了二十一个互助组，白天掏井，月下点花，人闲井不闲。老头刨窝，青壮年担水，妇女往窝里倒水，儿童投子。为节省劳力，要使各种不同劳力根据生活需要恰当的配备，发扬组和组互相自由调剂，把劳动力发挥到最高度。（二）合理的解决用水问题，缺水的地区更为重要。第一、掏井、掏泉，增加水源。第二、为避免浪费水，各组可根据情况把水井或水池分开（须民主决定公平合理），或议定那些组上午使水，那些组下午使水以免大家都同时使水，水又不够而浪费劳力。（三）合理的使用工具，去年宝皇大河道全村一百二十付水桶不够用，把油篓六付、酒篓三付，大锅十二口都用起来，并添购水桶。各组之间，又作了互相调剂。"

Excerpt: Hebei region has not yet received a thorough rain, sowing has not been completed, and seedlings are about to die from drought. In addition to agreeing with the Administrative Office's work arrangements for governments at all levels, in order to more effectively overcome the disaster, forces should be organized to implement the following: (1) Mobilize the masses to sow and protect seedlings, and actively prepare seeds for early-maturing, short-term crops, such as buckwheat and vegetables, for replanting after late rains. (2) When mobilizing the masses, extensively involve all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women, as well as animal power. In areas with a foundation and conditions, organize mutual aid teams, rationally dividing labor based on labor conditions, to maximize effectiveness. (3) In the sowing, seedling protection, and drought resistance movement, pay attention to the creation of mass experience, and mobilize the masses to create experience, promptly exchange experiences, and learn from each other, to quickly extinguish the disaster.\n    [Taihang News] Since the beginning of summer, many places in Taihang have not had rain for a long time, and the crops in the fields are showing signs of drought. Especially in the areas along the Pinghan Railway, crops such as millet and Chinese yam are either withering with rolled leaves or already yellow leaves. In some areas, sowing has not yet started after the wheat harvest due to drought. In Baidi, Huixian County, there are 70,000 mu, in Linxian County, there are 30,000 mu, and in Dong'anju Village, Shexian County, out of more than 1,800 mu of wheat fields, only more than 100 mu have been sown after harvesting, and the rest have not been sown. The Taihang Administrative Office recently telegraphed the First, Fifth, and Sixth Administrative Offices, urging them to closely monitor the development of the drought situation and immediately organize the masses to plant and water seedlings. The Shexian and Neiqiu County Committees of the Communist Party of China successively issued emergency calls at the beginning of this month, urging all cadres, party members, and the masses to immediately take action to fully protect seedlings, plant seeds, and fight against the drought. It was pointed out that Communist Party members must immediately lead and organize the masses to break the farmers' wait-and-see mentality, recall and summarize the experience of drought resistance and famine preparedness in previous years, build and restore canals, and use wells and cellars to plant. On the south bank of the Zhang River, the masses should be organized to irrigate the land and protect the seedlings. Dry land should be hoed more, and small seedlings should be covered with branches. And organize the masses to save and prepare for famine, collect wild vegetables, and promote careful use of water. Every village and household must formulate a production and savings plan. According to different regions, give play to the role of cooperatives, organize the masses to engage in various sideline productions, earn money to buy bran and grain, purchase seeds of early-maturing crops, and prepare to replant late crops.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会指示冀鲁豫  组织力量战胜灾荒  太行各地积极抗旱备荒\n\n1948-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会指示冀鲁豫\n    组织力量战胜灾荒\n    太行各地积极抗旱备荒\n    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会联合紧急指示冀鲁豫行署，严重注视和灾害斗争。略称：河北地区现在尚未落过透雨，播种尚未完成，小苗亦将旱死。除同意行署对各级政府之工作布置外，为了更有效的战胜灾荒，应该组织力量，加以贯彻：（一）发动群众播种保苗，并积极准备早熟短期作物，如荞麦、蔬菜等种子，以便在晚雨之后，进行补种。（二）发动群众时要广泛的把男女全半劳力及畜力都卷入运动。在有基础有条件地区，可组织变工互助，依据劳力情况合理分工，以发挥更大效能。（三）在播种保苗抗旱运动中，要注意群众经验的创造，并发动群众创造经验，及时的交流经验，互相学习，以便迅速扑灭灾荒。\n    【太行讯】太行很多地方入夏以来久未落雨之，田禾已呈旱象。特别是平汉沿线地区，谷子、山药等作物有的旱得卷了叶，有的叶子已经黄了。部分地区麦收后因天旱尚未下种。辉县白地有七万亩，林县有三万亩，涉县东安居全村一千八百多亩麦地，收割后除一百多亩下种外，其余都未下种。太行行署于日前电告一、五、六专署，严密注视旱象的发展，立即组织群众点种浇苗，中共涉县、内邱县委于本月初先后紧急号召所有干部党员群众，立即行动起来，全力保苗点种，向天旱作斗争。指出共产党员必须立即带领与组织群众打破农民等待思想，回忆总结历年抗旱备荒经验，开筑与恢复水渠，利用水井、水窑点种。尚河南岸要组织群众浇地保苗。旱地要多锄，用树枝遮盖小苗。并组织群众节约备荒，采集野菜，提倡细水长流。村村户户要订出生产节约计划。按照不同地区，发挥合作社作用，组织群众各种副业生产，赚钱买糠买粮，购买早熟作物的种子，准备补种晚庄稼。"

    "content": "[Hebei Central News] The oil pressing industry in Old Shulu City was well-known before the Incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War). The city had a total of 13 oil mills, 115 empty oil presses, 11 oil vats, 78 oil rollers, 5 diesel engines, and 4 electric rollers, employing 150 oil workers. Calculating for 10 months of work per year, it could press 3 million jin of soybean oil, cottonseed oil, and peanut oil, and around 22 million jin of oil cake. The products were sold as far as Tianjin, Beijing, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Shandong. The self-made sanitary oil (made from cottonseed oil) was sold to Guangdong and Guangxi, and Yunnan and Guizhou through Tianjin. Oil cakes were supplied to nearby counties for fertilizer or for feeding pigs and cattle. After the Incident, the oil industry was devastated by the Japanese invaders and completely collapsed. After liberation, with the support of our democratic government, it gradually recovered. Oil mills such as Guangcheng and Huaxing have started operations one after another. When industrial and commercial taxes were collected last year, in-depth investigation and research were lacking, and some burdens were unfairly distributed. Most oil mills had small capital and a shortage of raw materials. When the review was conducted last year, the manager of the Sihe Oil Mill was detained. Some other industrial and commercial sectors were encroached upon during this land reform, which affected the peace of mind of some oil mill managers or employees. These subjective and objective reasons greatly affected the development of the oil industry. Since the correction of errors began this year, the manager of Sihe Oil Mill was first released to help him resume business. The bank established overdraft transactions with the oil mills to solve their capital difficulties. Many oil mills have resumed operations one after another. In order to expand operations, eight oil mills recently discussed organizing themselves to go out to purchase raw materials and sell finished products in a unified manner to open up sales channels. The bank also provided 100 million yuan (border currency) to help them purchase raw materials. With the support of the government and the strengthening of the leadership of the trade union over the employees, the labor-capital relationship was properly resolved, and the workers' production enthusiasm was greatly improved. According to the general practice, each person processed 4 shi and 4 dou of raw materials per day. Workers in factories such as Jugong and Huaxing increased it to 5 shi and 4 dou per person per day. Now, 12 oil mills have been restored in the town, with 45 empty oil presses, 8 oil vats, 48 oil rollers, 2 diesel engines, and 1 electric roller. The daily output is 4,500 jin of oil and nearly 50,000 jin of oil cake. The oil production has recovered to 40% of the pre-war level.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 束鹿旧城油业逐渐恢复　每日产油四千余斤\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　束鹿旧城油业逐渐恢复\n    每日产油四千余斤\n    【冀中讯】束鹿旧城的榨油业，事变前就很有名。全市共十三家油坊，有一百一十五空油榨，十一个油槽，七十八盘油碾，并有五部柴油机，四个电滚子，打油工人有一百五十人。一年以工作十个月计算，能榨豆油、棉花籽油、花生油三百万斤，油饼二千二百万斤上下。产品远销于平津、开封、太原、山东等地。自制的卫生油（棉子油制），经过天津，销到两广和云贵。油饼供销附近各县，做肥料或喂猪、喂牛。事变后，油业遭日寇摧残，完全倒闭。解放后在我民主政府扶植下逐渐恢复，先后有广成、华兴等油坊开工。去年征收工商税时，未能深入调查研究，有的负担不公；大部油坊资本小、原料缺；去年复查时，四合油坊经理被扣，此次土改中侵犯了一些其他工商业，因此影响了一些油坊经理或职员不安心经营；这些主观客观的原因使油业发展受到很大影响。自今年开始纠偏后，首先将四合油坊的经理放回，帮助他恢复营业。银行与油坊建立了透支来往，解决他们的资本困难。许多油坊先后复业。为了扩大经营，最近八座油坊商议着组织起来外出统一购买原料，推销成品，开辟销路；银行并以一亿元（边币）扶助他们采购原料。油坊得到政府的扶植，职工会加强了对职工的领导，正确解决了劳资关系，工人生产情绪大大提高了。一般旧例每日每人打四石四斗原料，聚公、华兴等厂工人增到每人每日打五石四斗。现全镇已恢复油坊十二座，油榨四十五空，油槽八个。油碾四十八盘，柴油机两个，电滚子一个；每天出油四千五百斤，油饼近五万斤，产油量已恢复到战前百分之四十。"

In order to support the masses in developing the saltpeter industry, the Nitre and Sulphur Bureau invited a group of experienced workers from Ji County to Wuyi in December last year to start leaching. The leaching was abundant and of high quality, generating considerable income. Seeing the clear profitability of saltpeter leaching, the masses began to engage in it themselves. Cao Lanling and Zhang Menggeng from South Street organized six people, producing over a hundred catties of saltpeter per month, earning 84,000 yuan (Hebei-Henan currency). This concrete fact further solidified the masses' confidence in saltpeter leaching. In just a few days, forty households in East Street started leaching. Women in North Street also organized themselves to learn leaching. They were highly motivated, often scraping soil all night and preparing the pools early in the morning. During the busy farming season, men did the heavy work of pushing soil, filling pools, and draining water early in the morning and late at night, while women and children scraped soil, watched the pools, and added water at home. All social strata participated in this beneficial sideline. The landlord Li Shigen from North Street, with his entire family of ten, leached a total of 350 catties of saltpeter and 1,200 catties of salt from December last year to the present, earning 77,000 yuan and over 600 catties of wheat, enabling the whole family to have enough to eat and wear. The rich peasant Yang Yuting from East Street earned 1,200 catties of wheat and 52,800 yuan in fifty days, equivalent to the harvest of more than ten mu of wheat fields. Small merchant Xu Guozheng said, \"I truly regret not leaching saltpeter earlier. Now, after leaching two pots, I have yielded more than forty catties, which can earn more than 200 catties of wheat, equivalent to a spring's worth of trading.\" The lazy men Zhang Zhentao and Wei Peifen (female) also participated in saltpeter leaching and earned a lot of money. According to incomplete statistics, out of 482 households in ChengGuan, 282 households were leaching saltpeter. According to the Nitre and Sulphur Bureau's statistics from January to May, a total of over 27,300 catties of saltpeter were collected, expending over 62,000 catties of wheat and over 21 million yuan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武邑城关各阶层熬盐淋硝赚大钱\n\n1948-07-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武邑城关各阶层熬盐淋硝赚大钱\n    【冀南讯】武邑城关各阶层熬盐淋硝，获利很大。硝磺局为了扶植群众开展硝业，在去年十二月间，从冀县邀请一班有经验的把式到武邑开淋，淋的又多又好，赚钱很多。群众看到淋硝的确有利，也开始淋起来。南街曹兰铃、张孟庚组织起六个人，一个月产硝百多斤，赚了八万四千元（冀钞，下同）。这个具体的事实更加巩固了群众淋硝的信心，不到几天，东街四十来户都淋起来了。北街妇女也组织起来学淋。他们情绪很高，往往晚上刮一夜土，一早起就装好了池子。农忙时，男人一早一晚把推土、装池、排水等重活作了，妇女、儿童在家里刮土、看池子、添水。各阶层都参加了这种有益的副业，北街地主李世根全家十口淋硝，从去年十二月到现在，共淋三百五十斤硝，一千二百斤盐，赚了七万七千元和六百多斤麦子，全家作到有吃有穿。东街富农杨玉廷，在五十天内赚麦一千二百斤，钱五万二千八百元，顶十多亩麦田的收成。小商徐国正说：“我真后悔以前没淋硝，现时淋了两锅，就出了四十多斤，能赚麦子二百多斤，顶做一春的买卖。”懒汉张振涛、魏佩芬（女）也参加淋硝，赚了很多钱。据不完全的统计，城关四百八十二户中，有二百八十二户淋硝，据硝磺局一月至五月统计，共收硝二万七千三百多斤，支出麦子六万二千余斤，款二千一百余万元。"

In the Tahe, Huangta, and other eight villages of Wanping District alone, there are more than 100 patients (11 deaths), and in the Qiulinpu village of the Fourth District, 160 people have fallen ill. More than 30 students at a Laishui elementary school are sick. The Beiyue Third Administrative Office has issued an urgent instruction to all counties, calling for the rapid adoption of effective measures to prevent and eradicate the diseases, so as not to affect production and ensure \"prosperity for both people and wealth.\" It pointed out: (1) Organize doctors to diagnose and treat patients in disease-stricken villages, and increase research and innovation in disease symptoms and medicines. Call on doctors to spread secret recipes to improve their diagnostic and treatment skills and effectiveness. (2) Strengthen publicity and education among the masses. Seek treatment quickly when sick, and do not engage in superstition or seek witch doctors. Witch doctors should be reformed, and the government can punish them. (3) Strengthen disease prevention and carry out sanitation campaigns, such as sprinkling lime on the ground, putting white chess pieces in water tanks, eating less raw and cold food, and isolating the sick. (4) Provide special relief to poor households who are sick. The Administrative Office has allocated 45 million yuan (border currency) in medical loans to be distributed to various counties for the treatment of diseases.\n    [Further News] After receiving notification of a disease disaster in the Tahe District, the Wanping County Medical Association immediately held a forum for doctors in the entire district in Tahe Village on June 21 to study ways to eradicate the disease disaster. Doctors Du Yantian and Cui Shi proposed: Everyone should contribute what they have and use all their strength to eliminate the disease disaster. Think of more folk remedies and use cheap medicines instead of expensive ones as much as possible to reduce the financial burden on the masses. Everyone expressed great agreement with their opinions. After the meeting, they were divided into two groups to visit the sick in various households in Tahe Village. During the visits, a consultation method was adopted, with doctors taking turns to examine patients, followed by a discussion of what folk remedies to use and whether medication was needed. This approach not only provided a thorough understanding of the disease but also allowed for mutual learning of techniques and exchange of experience. The masses gratefully said, \"The higher authorities are truly concerned about us. As soon as they saw that we were sick, they sent doctors to us.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 涞水、宛平等地  组织医生扑灭病灾\n\n1948-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　涞水、宛平等地\n    组织医生扑灭病灾\n    【察哈尔讯】据涞水、宛平等地报告，各地近发现天花、瘟疹、疟痢等流行病，仅宛平一区塔河、黄塔等八村，即有一百多病人（死亡了十一名），四区秋林铺一村即病倒一百六十人；涞水一个高小即有三十多人闹病。北岳三专署特为此紧急指示各县，迅速采取有效措施，预防扑灭，以免影响生产保证“人财两旺”。指出：（一）组织医生到病灾村诊治，对病症、医药，多加研究创造，号召医生流传秘方，以提高医生诊治技术和效果。（二）加强对群众宣传教育，有病要赶快治，不要闹迷信求巫婆，对巫婆要改造，可由政府予以制裁。（三）加强疾病预防，开展清洁卫生运动，如地上洒石灰，水缸着白棋，少吃生冷，有病人就隔离。（四）对有病穷苦户，特予救济。专署拨出医药贷款四千五百万元（边币）分发各县，以为救治疾病之用。\n    【又讯】宛平县医联会接到塔河小区发生病灾的通知后，立即于六月二十一日，在塔河村召开全区医生座谈会，研究扑灭病灾的办法。杜砚田、璀石二医生提出：大家应该有什么就献出什么，以全部力量朴灭病灾，要多想一些偏方，要尽可能的用贱药代替贵药，使群众少花钱。大家对于他们的意见都表示非常同意。会后，即分成两个小组，到塔河村各病户中去看病。在看病时，都采用了会诊办法，轮流看过病人后，大家讨论用什么偏方治，是否需要吃药。这样作法，不地病症看的透彻，而且可以互相学习技术，交流经验。群众感激的说：“上级对咱们真关心，一见咱们有病，就给请了医生来了。”"

Gan, a poor military serviceman's family member and martyr's family member, organized with the help of the disaster relief agency to overcome the famine. Twenty-one people were divided into three groups. Two groups stayed at home, spinning yarn and managing household affairs, while the other group of seven specialized in textile production. They received cotton from the disaster relief agency and bought a batch of wool with a loan to actively engage in spinning. Soon, using the profits and some private funds, they bought a sock knitting machine. Initially, no one knew how to operate it, so one person was selected from the group to learn sock knitting techniques at the disaster relief agency. After mastering the skills, everyone provided yarn, and he knitted socks. In the past three months, they have made significant profits.

All manpower and animal power were divided into two groups: an agricultural group of three people and two donkeys, and a transportation group of two people and three donkeys, engaged in agriculture and transportation respectively. After the agricultural group finished sowing all 74 mu of land for the whole group, they all combined to engage in transportation. Using the original 1 million yuan (border currency) loan as capital, starting from April 12th, they bought 300 jin of oat flour in Tai and sold it in Nieying, earning a net profit of 480,000 yuan. After Ying County was captured by us, they went there to transport salt, and it is estimated that they can earn a profit of 1 million yuan in a month.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th. The severe famine in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, caused by the devastation and destruction of the Jiang-Hu bandit troops and affecting hundreds of thousands of people in fifteen counties, has gradually eased after more than eight months of arduous rescue and mutual assistance by the Party, government, army, and people of the entire region, from September of last year to May of this year, coupled with the summer harvest. Only in the Suide sub-region, in counties such as Mizhi, Jiaxian, Zhenchuan, and Hengshan, and in some areas of other sub-regions, are approximately 30,000 people still not completely free from the disaster because summer fields were not planted or were planted sparsely. Party and government organs are providing emergency relief.\n\nAs early as September of last year, when the Hu bandits began to collapse from the northern line after suffering heavy losses, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC and the Border Region Government established the Border Region Production and Disaster Relief Committee to uniformly lead the entire region's production and disaster relief work, implement the policy of combining production with disaster relief, prioritize disaster relief, and adopt various measures to vigorously rescue the situation. Chairman Lin Boqu, Secretary Xi Zhongxun, and others also personally went to the Suide sub-region, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, to conduct specific inspections and provide assistance. At the same time, a large amount of grain was transported from Taiyue and Longdong to provide relief. A summary of the production and disaster relief work over the past eight months is as follows:\n\nFirst, mobilize the masses for self-rescue and mutual assistance, reward the masses with interest-free or low-interest loans, organize adjustments between neighboring districts and townships, launch relief fundraising, and correctly utilize the fruits of struggle. The above methods have adjusted a total of 23,000 *shi* of grain. At the same time, the government allocated more than 18,000 *shi* of grain and mobilized disaster victims and people in non-disaster areas to transport it for emergency relief.\n\nSecond, vigorously organize and lead the masses in production, combining production with disaster relief. The following measures were adopted in agriculture: the government issued agricultural loans of 4 billion agricultural currency, and adjusted 2,900 *shi* of seeds; public and private sectors adjusted more than 13,000 pieces of agricultural implements; a large number of women, children, and other semi-labor forces were organized to participate in production; 500,000 *mu* of land left behind by migrants were quickly planted; and some small-scale water conservancy projects were built. In total, the region (excluding the Huanglong sub-region) planted 4.5 million *mu* of summer fields this year, which can yield 650,000 to 700,000 *shi* of grain (300 *jin* per *shi*), and 10.4 million *mu* of autumn fields. If there are no unexpected disasters, the harvest can reach the level of normal years. A total of 1.5 million *mu* of uncultivated wasteland, mostly in remote and poor areas, accounts for about 12% of the total cultivated area before the war; this is a significant reduction compared to the 3.65 million *mu* of wasteland last year.\n\nIn terms of sideline production: the democratic government sent more than 100 cadres to the countryside to organize and lead, and invested 2.8 billion agricultural currency and loaned 100,000 *jin* of cotton. Together with the military shoe cotton issued by the Border Region Finance Department and the cotton purchased by the masses themselves, the total amount of cotton invested in rural textile production was about 1 million *jin*, which can produce about 320,000 *pi* of cloth. Folk weaving industry can recover to 50% to 60% of the pre-war level. In addition, the masses were mobilized to boil saltpeter (now 40,000 *jin* of saltpeter have been collected), organize the transportation of grain, and support the production of salt, charcoal, and porcelain. The income from the above-mentioned sideline production is estimated to be equivalent to moving 41,000 people to reclaim wasteland in non-disaster areas and the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, and mobilizing local people to help resettle the refugees and adjust accommodation. The Longdong sub-region government alone allocated 240 million agricultural currency and 500 *shi* of grain to solve the problem of agricultural tools, seeds, and food for the immigrants.\n\nIn this disaster relief campaign, the most important lesson is that: in some areas, due to the failure to earnestly implement the policy of mobilizing the masses to adjust mutually and organizing production for self-rescue, as well as the existence of bureaucratic style in organization and leadership, the masses in some areas (such as the Suide sub-region) suffered some losses that could have been avoided or mitigated. Conversely, in areas where the policy of production for self-rescue was better implemented and concrete leadership was carried out (such as An塞, Qing润, and the four townships of Xiangshi District in Jiaxian County), the famine was overcome or mitigated earlier. The bureaucratic style in disaster relief was first manifested in the lack of sufficient understanding of the disaster situation below, or the failure to attach importance to it in a timely manner; they neither reported it to the higher levels nor actively tried to solve it. Second, there was a lack of concrete organization and inspection, especially in the early stage of transporting relief grain. Many counties and districts did not mobilize well in advance, and there were no cadres to lead, resulting in loose organization and slow work. Third, there was simple relief with average distribution. For example, in the seventh township of the Fen德 forty-li-pu district, the first time relief grain was distributed, it was not based on the specific situation of each disaster-stricken family, but uniformly one *sheng* per person. In the second township of Yanchuan Yongping District, the first time relief grain was distributed, it was used effectively for production, creating a situation where they were helpless after the relief grain was used up. Conversely, the four townships of Xiangshi District in Jiaxian County adopted democratic appraisal in coordination with production, giving preferential treatment to those who actively labored to reclaim wasteland, resulting in very little wasteland, no starvation deaths, and becoming a model for production and disaster relief.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 经各界奋力互助抢救  陕甘宁灾情已趋和缓\n\n1948-07-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　经各界奋力互助抢救\n    陕甘宁灾情已趋和缓\n    【新华社西北十二日电】陕甘宁边区遭蒋胡匪军蹂躏破坏，蔓延十五县数十万人口的严重灾荒，经全区党政军民自去年九月至今年五月八个多月的奋力抢救互助，接上夏收，现灾情已趋和缓，仅绥德分区之米脂、葭县、镇川、横山等县及其他分区一部分地区，因夏田未种或种得少，尚有三万人左右未完全免除灾害。党政机关正作紧急救济。\n    早在去年九月当胡匪受创开始由北线溃退时，中共西北局、边区政府即成立边区生产救灾委员会，统一领导全区生产救灾工作，贯彻生产结合救灾方针，将救灾列为首要工作，采取多种办法，大力抢救。林伯渠主席、习仲勋书记等亦先后亲赴灾荒最重的绥德分区具体检查帮助，同时并由太岳及陇东赶运大批粮食救济。兹将八个多月生产救灾工作综述如下：\n    首先发动群众自救互济，奖励群众以无利或低利借贷，组织邻近区乡间的调剂，发动救济募捐，并正确利用斗争果实。上述各面办法共调剂粮食二万三千石。同时，由政府拨粮一万八千余石，发动灾民及非灾区人民运输救急。\n    其次，大力组织领导群众生产，使生产与救灾结合。农业方面采取了下列办法：政府曾发放农贷四十亿农币，调剂子种二千九百余石；公私调剂农具一万三千余件；大量组织妇女儿童等半劳力参加生产；抢种移民留下的土地五十万亩；并兴修了部分小型水利。总计全区（黄龙分区除外）今年共种夏田四百五十万亩，可收粮六十五至七十万石（每石三百斤），种秋田一千零四十万亩，如无意外灾害可达平年收成。未种熟荒共一百五十万亩，多属远地、坏地，约占战前全部耕地面积的百分之十二；较去年荒芜三百六十五万亩，已大见减少。\n    副业生产方面：民主政府曾派出百余名干部下乡进行组织领导，并投资农币二十八亿元，贷棉花十万斤。连同边府财政厅所发军鞋花及群众自购花等，投入农村纺织生产的棉花共约有百万斤，约可产布三十二万疋。民间编织业可恢复到战前水平的百分之五十到六十。此外并发动群众熬硝（现已收硝四万斤），组织贩运粮食，扶助盐、炭、瓷业生产等。上述副业生产收入估计折员四万一千人移垦非灾区及晋绥解放区，发动当地人民帮助移来难民调剂住宿，政府亦拨放粮款协助。仅陇东分区政府即拨农币二亿四千万元，粮食五百石作解决移民农具子种口粮之用。\n    在这次救灾运动中，最主要的教训是：部分地区由于未认真执行发动群众互相调剂，组织生产自救的方针，以及组织领导上官僚主义作风的存在，使某些地区（如绥德分区）群众遭受了某些本可避免或可减轻的损失。反之，执行生产自救方针较好，又进行了具体领导的地区（如安塞、清润及葭县响石区四乡），灾荒即能及早克服或减轻。救灾中的官僚主义作风，首先表现在对下面受灾情况不十分了解，或者未能及时重视；既不向上反映，又不积极设法解放。其次是缺乏具体组织检查，特别表现在初期运救济粮工作上，许多县区事先未很好动员，又无干部领导，致组织松懈，工作迟缓。再次是单纯救济平均发放，如纷德四十里铺区第七乡第一次发救济粮时不按灾民各家具体情况，而一律平均每人一升。延川永坪区二乡第一次发救济粮食有效的用于生产，形成救济粮发完便束手无策的现象。反之，葭县响石区四乡采取民主评议配合生产，从优照顾了积极劳动抢种荒地者，结果荒地很少，也未饿死人，并成为生产救灾模范。"

    "content": "Nanzhang Promotion Society in Wucheng\n    Mobilizes and Persuades the Masses to Carry Out Soil Cloth Rectification\n    [This News] In the vast area north of the Hutuo River in Wucheng County, there is a traditional base for weaving. However, the quality of cloth produced varies. Some people are accustomed to weaving bad cloth, known as \"top peeling and bottom ring\" (bad overlaps, good front), selling it to deceive people. Users often go to many markets without buying good cloth, wasting a lot of work back and forth. Weavers also feel that it is difficult to sell finished products. According to the needs of the masses, the Nanzhang Branch of the County Promotion Society decided to use Bird Brand and Tiger Brand as standards to carry out rectification, and was responsible for selling finished products. At the beginning, they publicized the benefits of rectification in the market, explained the standard size and weight, and the society bought the qualified cloths at a higher price. Seeing the benefits, weavers gradually increased the number of people who changed their cloths, and users would not be fooled. The society can collect more than 8,600 pieces of cloth per market. The local habit is to weave more water-line cloth, which must be dried before it can be branded. Bundling and weighing take a lot of time and are prone to mildew. Therefore, experiments were carried out to change the collection of dry-line cloth. After two markets of brewing, the masses were still afraid of being hurt. The society appropriately increased the price of dry cloth, and for those who handed in wet cloth, they were gently persuaded to dry it before handing it in. For dry cloth that was slightly wet, it was accepted and dried by the society itself. While collecting cloth, they publicized it at the same time, and the rectification work has been remarkable in two months. The old habit of weaving bad cloth for decades has gradually changed. The Promotion Society listened to the opinions of the masses and set up stalls in Zhao Village, Nandong, and Xiaoguozhuang to collect cloth, which further reduced the round-trip journey for the masses and was well received. They all said, \"In this way, you can sell cloth early and late, which saves more work than going to the market.\" In the past six months, the society has collected more than 200,000 pieces of soil cloth, and the masses have benefited more than 450,000,000 yuan (border currency). (Reporters Huai Yu, Yao Fu)\n    (Soil Cloth Rectification - Many counties in Beiyue and Central Hebei take weaving soil cloth as the main household sideline.

Based on the spirit of the May district committee joint conference, the conference studied and reviewed the history of women's work in Taihang, and determined the new direction for future women's work. The conference conducted detailed discussions on mobilizing women to participate in various productions during land reform, the allocation and training of leading cadres in women's work, and the resolution of women's special issues. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Zhao Shizhen of the District Party Committee delivered a concluding speech. He first pointed out: \"The women of Taihang have been considerably mobilized. In the double reduction of 1942 and the production campaign to overcome famine in 1943, the broad masses of women actively participated and improved their social and family status through production, greatly enhancing their awareness. By the time of the land reform in 1946, the guidance was even clearer in mobilizing women to participate, mobilizing and liberating women from the entire peasant liberation movement, thus significantly improving women's class and political consciousness. After the reorganization meeting, to further strengthen women's work, we reallocated forces, equipped institutions, and improved women's organizations, elevating women's work to a more important position. The women in the land reform experimental villages have also gained further mobilization and improvement.\" Talking about the future direction of women's work, he said: \"After the basic completion of land reform work in Taihang, women's work should be valued by the entire party, giving full play to the productive forces of the broad masses of women, participating in large-scale agricultural, industrial, and sideline production, and fully utilizing women's strength to enhance support for the war. And, separately and step by step, with a long-term perspective, achieve family harmony, gender equality, and freedom of marriage, establishing a democratic, free, and happy life for the masses to promote the full development of productive forces, improve women's cultural and political level, and train women cadres. The main criteria for examining women's work in the future are whether the productive forces of women have been fully utilized. If they have been utilized, then there are achievements; otherwise, there are no achievements or the achievements are not significant. Women's work revolves around developing production and promoting democracy. Because the purpose of land reform is to develop productive forces. Solving women's special problems also aims at harmonious families and developing production. As for what production is the main focus, it should be determined according to local conditions and women's own conditions. At the same time, in production, publicize production policies, make plans according to households, and gradually implement family division of labor (not too high), the purpose of which is also to fully utilize women's productive forces, increase family wealth, improve women's status, and improve women's lives. Regarding textiles, the current focus is not on development but on improvement. If it is not improved, the finished products will be difficult to sell. The resolution of women's special problems must be done separately and step by step, and cannot be separated from production. Regarding the leadership of women's work, we should always pay attention to arranging women's work in various tasks. When discussing the allocation and training of cadres, we should pay close attention to the allocation and training of women cadres. The Women's Committee should improve its institutions, strengthen guidance, establish a meeting reporting system, regularly provide information to the Party Committee, raise questions, research and discuss them at various Party meetings, make decisions, and implement them throughout the Party.\" Comrade Zhao Shizhen repeatedly emphasized that the current center of women's work is to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in the large-scale production movement. The meeting requested that every woman cadre be at ease with her own work, improve her political level, and pay attention to training a large number of women cadres. He called on the participants to study and master the Party's policies well, and study the Party's documents.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 发动妇女参加大生产　太行区党委召开妇女工作会议\n\n1948-07-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　发动妇女参加大生产\n    太行区党委召开妇女工作会议\n    【太行讯】太行区党委于六月十七日至二十八日召开各地委妇委联席会议，根据五月地委联席会议的精神，研究检查太行妇女工作的历史，确定今后新的妇女工作方针。会议对土改中发动妇女参加各种生产、妇女工作领导干部的配备与培养，及妇女特殊问题的解决等，均作了详细讨论。会终，区党委赵时真同志作了总结发言，他首先指出：“太行妇女是有相当发动的；一九四二年的双减及一九四三年的生产渡荒，广大妇女都积极参加了，并从生产中提高了自己的社会地位及家庭地位，大大锻炼了妇女的觉悟。至一九四六年土地改革，指导上更明确发动妇女参加，从整个农民解放运动中发动与解放妇女，因而使妇女的阶级觉悟与政治觉悟有了显著提高。整编会议后，为进一步加强妇女工作，重新调动力量，配备机构，健全了妇女组织，将妇女工作更提到重要位置上来。在土改实验村的妇女群众，也获得进一步的发动与提高。”谈到今后妇女工作的方针，他说：“在太行土改工作基本上完成之后，妇女工作更应该为全党所重视，充分发挥广大妇女的生产力，参加大生产运动的农工副业生产；充分发挥妇女力量，增强支援战争。并有分别地、有步骤地从长期着眼，实现家庭和睦，男女平等，婚姻自由，建立群众的民主自由幸福生活，以促进生产力的充分发展，提高妇女的文化政治水平，培养妇女干部。今后考查妇女工作的主要标准，即看是否充分发挥了妇女的生产力，发挥了，即是有成绩，否则即是没有成绩或成绩不大。妇女工作一切围绕发展生产，发扬民主。因为土改目的是为了发展生产力。解决妇女特殊问题，也是以和睦家庭、发展生产为归宿。至于以什么生产为主，应依当地条件与妇女本身条件而定。同时在生产中宣传生产政策，作按家计划，逐步实行家庭分工（不要太高），其目的亦在把妇女生产力充分发挥起来，增加家庭财富，提高妇女地位，改善妇女生活。关于纺织，目前不是发展而是提高，如不提高，则成品难销。对妇女特殊问题的解决，必须有分别、有步骤，且不能离开生产去解决。关于妇女工作的领导，应在各种工作中经常注意布置妇女工作。在讨论干部配备与培养时，应很好注意妇女干部的配备与培养，妇委应健全机构，加强指导，建立会议汇报制，经常向党委提供情况，提出问题，在党的各种会议上研究讨论，做出决定，贯彻全党。”赵时真同志一再强调指出：目前妇女工作的中心是发动广大妇女参加大生产运动。会议要求每个妇女干部安心于自己的工作，提高自己政治水平，并注意培养大批妇女干部。他号召与会者要很好的学习掌握党的政策，研究党的文件。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th.\n\n　　Despite the fact that the Soviet Zone of Germany suffered far greater war damage than the western occupation zones, and the restoration of industry and agriculture faced serious difficulties, the current level of industrial production in the area has reached 56.9 percent of the 1936 level. At the end of last year, coal production was 90 percent of pre-war levels; in 1947, the agricultural cultivated area increased to 94 percent of 1938 levels. On the other hand, the industrial production level in the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany is only 38.6 percent of the pre-war level. Coal production in the Ruhr is 50 to 60 percent of pre-war levels; agricultural cultivated area is 50 percent of pre-war levels.\n\n　　The economic achievements of the Soviet occupation zone are primarily due to the cleansing of Nazi elements from all administrative institutions with the help of the Soviet military government, replaced by democratic elements. Now, the economic restoration work in eastern Germany is guided by people's representatives, anti-fascists, and democratic people. For example, Müller, a former metal worker from Chemnitz who was imprisoned in concentration camps for many years, is now the mayor of the city. Ligel, a former prisoner of the Buchenwald concentration camp and a printing worker, is now the police chief of the city.\n\n　　The nationalization of industry has brought fundamental changes to the economy of the Soviet occupation zone. According to official figures released, at the end of 1947, the percentages of nationalized industries in the Soviet occupation zone were: mining 97.3 percent, metallurgical industry 52.7 percent, power industry 60 percent, and machinery manufacturing 42.5 percent. Three thousand enterprises that have been nationalized exceeded the total production plan by 9 percent last year, surpassing private enterprises.\n\n　　The Soviet military government provides constant assistance to enterprises in its occupation zone. In this regard, Marshal Sokolovsky's order on \"methods to increase labor productivity and further improve the material conditions of workers in industry and transportation\" played an important role. The democratic newspapers praised this order as \"a program for labor to overcome poverty and chaos.\" Industrial workers in the Soviet occupation zone receive extra hot meals, paid vacation wages, and consumer goods. Marshal Sokolovsky also issued a special order restricting the working hours of young people. Equal pay for equal work for men and women is also expressly stipulated.\n\n　　The land reform implemented in the Soviet occupation zone also has a very important impact. As a result of the liquidation of landlord estates, the number of farms owning 5 to 20 hectares (16 Chinese acres per hectare) has doubled. The peasant mutual aid committees generated during the land reform process are carrying out the basic work of democratizing the German countryside. Seventy percent of the farmers in eastern Germany participate in these committees. The peasant mutual aid committees hold about 4,000 machine and tractor stations, 2,000 repair shops, and 4,800 agricultural raw material processing enterprises.\n\n　　People's Control Committees play a significant organizational role in various economic sectors of the Soviet occupation zone. The People's Control Committees are composed of representatives of the working people's democratic strata, who supervise the correct use of raw materials, production, and distribution. In the province of Thuringia, there are 700 such committees. Last year, they confiscated goods worth 8 million marks that had been hoarded through speculation and concealment. (Excerpt from the Soviet Labor Daily)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 德境苏占区的经济建设\n\n1948-07-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　德境苏占区的经济建设\n    尽管德境苏占区的战争损害远较西部占领区为大，工农业之复原有着严重的困难，但是，该区现在的工业生产水平已达一九三六年水平的百分之五十六点九。去年年底，煤的生产为战前产量的百分之九十；一九四七年内，农业耕种面积提高到一九三八年的百分之九十四。另一方面，西德联合占领区的工业生产水平，却只有战前水平的百分之三十八点六。鲁尔的煤产为战前水平的百分之五十至六十；农业耕种面积为战前水平的百分之五十。\n    苏联占领区的经济成就，首先是由于在苏联军政府帮助下，将纳粹分子清洗出一切行政机构，而代以民主分子的结果。现在，德国东部的经济复原工作，是由人民的代表，反法西斯与民主人士来指导的。例如开姆尼斯以前的金属工人缪勒，曾被监禁在集中营中多年，现在，他已成为该市的市长。前布根威尔集中营的囚徒、印刷工人李格尔，现在是该市的警察局长。\n    工业的国有化给苏联占领区的经济带来了根本的变化。根据已发表的官方数字，一九四七年底苏占领区实行了国有化的工业：矿业为全部的百分之九十七点三；冶金工业为百分之五十二点七；动力工业为百分之六十；机器制造业为百分之四十二点五。三千个已经国有化了的企业，去年超过总生产计划百分之九，驾凌于私营企业之上。\n    苏联军政府给予其占领区内的企业以经常的帮助。在这一方面，索柯洛夫斯基元帅“增加劳动生产力及进一步改善工业与运输业职工物质条件办法”的命令，起了重要的作用。民主报纸称颂这一命令为“劳工战胜贫困与紊乱的纲领”。苏联占领区的产业工人有额外的热食，假期工资照付，还得到消费品的供给。索柯洛夫斯基元帅又颁布特别命令，限制青年人的工作时间。男女同工同酬也明令规定。\n    苏联占领区所贯彻的土地改革，也有很重要的影响。由于清算了地主庄园的结果，拥有五公顷至二十公顷（每公顷合十六华亩）之农庄的数目，已经增加一倍。在土地改革过程中产生的农民互助委员会，正进行德国乡村民主化的基本工作。德国东部的农民，百分之七十参加了这种委员会。农民互助委员会握有约四千所机器与拖拉机站、二千所修理厂、四千八百个农业原料加工企业。\n    人民管制委员会在苏占区各经济部门中起了重大的组织作用。人民管制委员会由劳动人民民主阶层的代表组成，他们监督原料的正确使用，生产与分配。在绍林吉亚省，就有七百个这种委员会。它们在去年没收了用投机与隐藏等手段而囤积起来的货物，价值八百万马克。（摘自苏联劳动报）\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北十四日电】"

    "content": "Break the Idea of Relying on Heaven for Food: Organize to Conquer Drought\n  　　　　　Yuanzhao, Weixian County, Jinnan: Temporary Mutual Aid to Plant Late Seedlings\n    [Jinnan News] The Weixian County Party Committee in Yuanzhao called on the masses to mobilize urgently to dig earth wells in large numbers, carry water to plant late seedlings, develop sideline production such as leaching salt and weaving, and practice strict economy to prevent famine. After various forms of publicity and mobilization, the masses in various villages gradually turned the call of the County Party Committee into action. Li Xinzhen, an activist from Li Maling Village in the Fifth District, introduced the specific experience of his group in planting sweet potatoes at the production team leaders' joint meeting, which increased the confidence of each group in planting. He said, \"You can't be impatient when planting sweet potatoes in dry weather. Water them more, and they won't die from drought even in twenty days. If you want to plant quickly, you must mobilize both men and women, and assign specific tasks: men carry water, and women, children, and old men water, spread seedlings, and seal soil mounds. Our group rushed for seven days and planted twenty-one mu.” Under the practical influence of his group and the active leadership of village cadres and party members, the masses in the village planted a total of ninety-one mu of sweet potatoes in five days. Thirteen households in Dongtianzhuang in the Seventh District organized a temporary mutual aid group and carried water to plant eleven and a half mu. In order to save the fast-ripening pumpkins, party members and the masses in Huazhuang Village launched a pumpkin-watering competition. Some dug earth wells, and some carried water. In two days, they watered thirty-nine mu. The masses of Yangcun Temple put forward the slogan of \"saving for famine\" and \"saving the bottom of the granary rather than the top.\" Eighty households completely switched from eating wheat to coarse grains.\n    [Another News] Wang Gaozhai Village in the Second District of Weixian County failed to seize the opportunity to plant late seedlings and sweet potatoes after the last thorough rain. Many people had the idea of relying on heaven for food and were unwilling to carry water for planting; some middle peasants were afraid of being drawn on again if they had too much land and were unwilling to produce actively. Middle peasant Wang Jinshan didn't put manure on his land, and two people had already eaten more than a bag of newly harvested wheat. Xin Zhongnong Wang Jinshan had more land and felt uneasy because he was afraid of being drawn on. In view of this situation, the work team convened a mass meeting, clarifying that the land problem in the village had been resolved, and that individual households with less than the average amount could be filled in with temple land and land accumulated by the farmers' association. It called on everyone to plant late seedlings, accumulate fertilizer, and save with peace of mind. The masses felt relieved and began to discuss production. Some said, \"If you plant sweet potatoes late, they will only grow hairy roots!\" Others said, \"It will be too late to plant after entering the dog days. You can't just wait for rain.\" Breaking the idea of relying on heaven for food, the entire village voluntarily formed nine temporary mutual aid groups. Strong young men carried water, and children and women watered and built mounds. In five days, they planted more than eighty mu of sweet potatoes. In order to plant more and harvest more, every household actively accumulated fertilizer. Middle peasant Wang Laoying plans to plant seven mu of wheat this year, and each mu needs three large carts of fertilizer. At present, he has mixed soil wheat, chaff, and green grass together and composted seven or eight large carts of fertilizer. Wang Laofeng applied a lot of fertilizer last year, and the wheat harvest was good. Now he has dug a large manure pit and is preparing to compost six or seven more carts than last year. The masses said, \"Prevent drought every year, and prevent thieves every night. You can't just eat wheat!\" At present, many households have begun to eat coarse grains instead of just wheat.\n    　　　　Yangcheng and Other Counties Carry Water to Plant\n    [Taiyue News] Yangcheng, Jincheng, Gaoping, and Qinshui counties have not had rain for a long time, and most of the stubble land has not been planted yet. The leaders of the counties have respectively called on the masses to carry water for planting, speed up weeding, and overcome the disaster. In most areas of the four counties, people have begun to carry water for planting. Dianyao in Yangcheng is a small village that accepted the experience of \"preventing drought every year.\" It dug thirty thatched ponds on the edge of the fields and roads early on, which can store rainwater and compost fertilizer, and this time they were used for planting. During planting, forces were closely organized, and both men and women were assigned specific tasks. Some plowed the land, some dug pits, and some scooped fertilizer for planting. Everyone was busy. People had been at the village well for seven or eight consecutive days. The entire village planted more than seven hundred mu in ten days and weeded the millet twice. Hotels, Yiyi, Liuchang, Yuezhuang, Nandie, Yinjiagou and other villages carried more than 40,000 dan of water, plus composted fertilizer, and planted more than 2,000 mu. In Jincheng's Seventh District, carrying water and fertilizer for planting late autumn crops has resulted in over 3,000 mu of planted corn, according to incomplete statistics. Lilichuan Village had the best labor organization, with more than 800 people working in the fields. They planted 200 mu in seven days. Zhongcun and other twenty villages in Qinshui also organized all their forces and invested in carrying water for planting. However, individual villages in the above four counties are still waiting and praying for rain, and are not actively fighting the drought. On June 28th, cadres and masses in Dingyan Village, Yangcheng, set up an altar to chant scriptures and pray for rain for seven days, wasting 171,000 yuan (Jibi currency), 29 jin of white flour, and 12 jin of lamp oil.\n    　　　　Breakthrough Key Points to Promote Overall Progress: Suning's Sixth District Actively Digs Wells\n    [Jizhong News] Suning's Sixth District used the method of breaking through key points to promote overall progress, changing the masses' habit of being unwilling to dig wells. At the beginning of this year, the Hebei-Central Water Conservancy Work Team arrived in Suning's Sixth District and determined that Dawangzhuang was the key village for well digging. At the beginning of the work, the masses were read newspapers and enlightened, saying, \"Land reform is for developing production and living a good life. How can we live a good life?\" At that time, Zhang Guangyi said, \"To live a good life, we must dig wells.\" (In 1942, when there was a drought, Zhang Guangyi harvested three bags of corn per mu because he dug a well and watered the land. Others who did not have wells to water the land only harvested one or two dou. Therefore, he had great confidence in digging wells.) The leadership found several activists through him, and each person then colluded with six or seven households, and convened a meeting to discuss how to dig wells. Each household reported how much private money they could contribute, and the insufficient part was helped with loans. Through the leading influence of these backbone members and the continuous publicity of the benefits of digging wells, the masses' concerns about digging wells were gradually broken, and a well-digging movement was launched. Six wells have now been dug, two have been repaired, and five new wells and two old wells are starting to be built. After Dawangzhuang created a fever, the relatives and friends of the well-digging households in the village were used to publicize the benefits of digging wells in many ways. Sun Yanchi from Licun came to the well-digging team and asked for a loan to dig a well, and the work team seized him to organize and promote well-digging in Licun. Later, Licun and Wobei were organized to dig wells together. On this basis, the leadership called on the entire district to carry out the well-digging movement. However, deviations occurred in the mastery, such as squeezing the masses to take private money, and failing to issue the loans that should have been issued in a timely manner, so some farmers who wanted to dig wells were still unwilling to do so. After the review and correction, the enthusiasm of the masses increased again. Dawangzhuang established a \"Water Conservancy Section\" under the village production committee to specifically lead well digging. Dawangzhuang and Songzhuang lent the bricks from the fruits of the village struggle to the masses at a combined price. Through these efforts, Dawangzhuang formed eight new large wells and three old large wells in one day, and some started construction the next day. The village plans to dig 20 wells. As of the end of June, 14 new wells had been dug and 7 old wells had been repaired in 15 villages in the district; 41 new and old wells were under construction or about to begin construction. The capital used included 34.25 million yuan (border currency), 3,800 yuan of floating property, 79.9 million yuan in loans, and 450 jin of loaned grain.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 打破靠天吃饭思想组织起来战胜旱灾\n\n1948-07-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　打破靠天吃饭思想组织起来战胜旱灾\n  　　　　　冀南元朝威县　临时互助点种晚苗\n    【冀南讯】元朝县委号召群众紧急动员起来，大量挖土井、挑水点种晚苗；开展淋盐、编织等副业生产；并厉行节约防备灾荒。各村群众经过各种形式的宣传动员，逐步把县委号召变成行动。五区李马陵村积极分子李新贞在生产组长联席会上，介绍了本组栽红薯的具体经验，提高了各组点种的信心。他说：“旱天种红薯不能心急，多浇点水，二十天也旱不死。要想种的快，必须把男女都动员起来，具体分工，男子挑水，妇女儿童老头浇水、散秧、封土堆。俺组这样突击了七天，种上二十一亩。”该村群众在他这个组的实际影响和村干、党员的积极领导下，五天内共栽红薯九十一亩。七区东田庄十三户组织了临时互助组，挑水栽了十一亩半。化庄党员群众为了把快熟的南瓜救住，全村掀起了浇瓜竞赛，有的挖土井，有的挑水，两天内浇了三十九亩。杨村寺群众提出“节约备荒”“能省囤尖不省囤底”的口号，有八十户由光吃麦子完全换上粗粮。\n    【又讯】威县二区王高砦村，在上次落透雨后，没抓紧抢种晚苗和红薯，不少群众存在靠天吃饭思想，不愿担水点种；有些中农怕地多了再抽，不愿积极生产。中农王金善有粪不往地里拉，新收的麦子两口人已经吃了一布袋多。新中农王金山土地多一点，怕抽他的，心里不安。根据这种情况，工作组便召开群众大会，讲明这村土地问题已经解决，个别户不足平均数，可由庙地和农会积存的土地填平。号召大家安心点种晚苗，积肥，节约。群众安下心来酝酿生产，有的说：“种红薯种晚了光长毛根！”有的说：“等入了伏再种就晚了，光等雨可不行。”打破了靠天吃饭的思想，全村自愿结合了九个临时互助组，青壮年担水，儿童妇女点水、培墩，五天内种红薯八十余亩。群众为了多种多收，家家积极积肥，中农王老营今年计划种麦七亩，每亩要上粪三大车。现时他把土麦、糠和青草拌在一起，已沤成了七八大车粪。王老凤去年上粪多，麦子收的好。现在他又挖了一个大粪坑，准备比去年再多沤粪六、七车。群众说：“年年防旱，夜夜防贼，不能光吃麦子！”现时已有不少户从光吃麦子开始吃粗粮。\n    　　　　阳城等县担水点种\n    【太岳讯】阳城、晋城、高平、沁水四县久未落雨，大部茬地还没种上。各县领导上分别号召群众担水点种，加紧锄苗，战胜灾荒。四县大部地区，纷纷开始担水点种。阳城殿腰是个小村，接受过去“年年防旱”的经验，早在地边路边挖了三十个茅池，既可存储雨水，又可沤粪，这次点种就用上了。点种时严密的组织了力量，男女全半劳力具体分工，有的犁地，有的挖坑，有的舀粪点种，人人不闲。村里水井上一连七、八天没断过人。全村十天点种了七百多亩，又把谷子赶锄了二遍。酒店、阳邑、留昌、岳庄、南底、尹家沟等村担水四万多担，加上沤粪，共点种了二千多亩。晋城七区担水担粪点种晚秋，据不完全统计，已点种玉茭三千亩。犁川村组织劳力最好，全村有八百多人上地，七天就点种了二百亩。沁水中村等二十村也组织了全部力量，投入担水点。但以上四县仍有个别村庄还在等雨求雨，没有积极的与旱灾作斗争。阳城町岩村干部和群众在六月二十八日设坛念经，求神求雨，闹了七天，浪费了十七万一千元（冀钞），白面二十九斤，灯油十二斤。\n    　　　　突破重点推动全面　肃宁六区积极打井\n    【冀中讯】肃宁六区运用突破重点、推动全面的方法，转变了群众不愿打井的习惯。今年一开春，冀中水利工作组到了肃宁六区，确定以大王庄为打井重点村。工作开始首先给群众念报，启发群众说：“土改是为了发展生产，过好日子，怎么才能过好日子呢？”当时张广义说：“要过好日子就得打井。”（民国三十一年天旱时，因张广义打了井浇了地，每亩棒子收了三口袋，别人没井浇地，只收了一、二斗。因此，他对打井信心很大。）领导上便通过他找了几个积极分子，每人再串通六、七户，召开会议，讨论如何打井的办法。每户都自报了能出多少私资，不足部分就用贷款帮助。经过这些骨干分子的带头影响，和不断宣传打井的好处，逐渐打破了群众对打井的顾虑，掀起了打井运动，现在已打成六眼，修成了两眼，还有五个新井两个旧井正在开始动工。大王庄造成热潮后又通过，该村打井户的亲戚朋友，多方宣传打井的好处。李村孙砚池便来找打井组，要求贷款打井，工作组就抓紧他在李村组织推动。后来又组织李村、窝北合伙打井。在这个基础上，领导上便号召全区开展打井运动。但在掌握上发生了挤着群众拿私资，该发的贷款没有及时发下去等偏向，有些要求打井的农民仍不愿打了。检讨纠正后，群众情绪再次提高。大王庄在村生产委员会下面设了“水利股”，专门领导打井。大王庄、宋庄把村里斗争果实中的砖合成价贷给群众。经这些努力，大王庄一天就组成了八眼新大井，三眼旧大井，有的第二天就动起工来。该村计划可打井二十眼。截至六月底，该区十五个村已打成新井十四眼，修理旧井七眼；正在动工和即将动工的有新旧井四十一眼。动用的资本包括私资三千四百二十五万元（边币，下同），浮财三千八百元，贷款七千九百九十万元和贷粮四百五十斤。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Comprehensive reports from various sources: Students in Peiping bravely broke through the Chiang government's martial law to hold a solemn demonstration and a memorial service to accuse and protest the monstrous crime of the Chiang and Fu cliques in creating the \"July 5th Massacre,\" which resulted in the deaths and injuries of over a hundred students. On the morning of the 9th of this month, over ten thousand students (according to the Associated Press report) from seventeen universities and middle schools in Peiping and those who had come to Peiping from the Northeast, held \"the largest demonstration ever seen here\" (United Press). The marching crowd carried wreaths, sang the mournful elegy of the \"July 5th\" martyrs, and shouted just slogans along the way such as \"Arrest and execute the murderer Fu Tso-yi,\" \"Execute Chen Jicheng\" (note: Chen is the Peiping Garrison Commander, one of the main culprits in this massacre), \"The Bandit Suppression Headquarters is the People Suppression Headquarters,\" \"Oppose the government's policy of suppressing the people,\" and \"Give us back the blood of the fourteen martyrs.\" The students wrote anti-massacre slogans and cartoons in chalk on the shops and vehicles along the street. The students claimed that the number of students killed in the \"July 5th Massacre\" had increased to fourteen and pointed out that \"the July 5th incident was the result of Fu Tso-yi ordering the army to open fire when necessary\" (Associated Press).\n\nAt about 9:00 AM, the student march gathered at the residence of the pseudo-Vice President Li Zongren on North Chang Street and sent representatives to petition, putting forward several solemn demands: \"Severely punish Fu Tso-yi,\" \"Unconditionally release the students arrested in the July 5th Massacre,\" \"Lift martial law,\" \"Immediately establish Northeastern Provisional University and Northeastern Provisional Middle School to accommodate all Northeastern students in public and private universities and middle schools in Peiping and provide them with public funding,\" and \"Give generous compensation to the families of the deceased students, be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured, and the funeral expenses of the deceased.\" Li Zongren prevaricated in every possible way, \"but did not agree to do anything\" (United Press).\n\nAfter the petition yielded no results, the marching crowd, disregarding the Chiang government's re-implementation of emergency martial law and the encirclement of them by thousands of military police and armored vehicles, marched in formation through the main streets, and accused the Chiang and Fu cliques with slogans, songs, and mutual question-and-answer sessions.\n\nAt 5:00 PM, the marching crowd returned to the Democracy Square of Peking University and, regardless of the encirclement by a large number of fully armed military police, held the \"Northeast and North China Students' Protest Against the July 5th Massacre Memorial and Accusation Meeting.\" The entire audience was filled with grief and anger. \"One student's speech targeted the Kuomintang authorities.

The guerrillas organized by the Albanian people during the war numbered in the tens of thousands. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they stubbornly resisted the enemy and finally drove the invading troops out of the entire territory at the end of 1944.

Martial law has been declared, and open terror is rampant in Malaya, with approximately a thousand people arrested in the past week. The agency continued: After the war, Malaya is particularly important to Britain, and Malaya is creating a large amount of wealth for Britain. However, the United States has recently intervened in Malaya and is taking over control of Malayan rubber and tin resources. British tin and rubber companies are caught between two millstones – on one side is American control over prices, and on the other side is the struggle of the working masses to increase wages and living standards and to gain recognition of trade unions. Therefore, Britain is losing its hope of restoring its pre-war position; before the war, Britain was able to colonize Malaya as it pleased.

    "content": "From the front line in Yudu, Xinhua News Agency, 14th: A front-line reporter reports the story of the capture of Qu Shounian, the Chiang Kai-shek army's Sixth Pacification Deputy Commander and Corps Commander, during the Yudu campaign: On the evening of July 1st, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack on Longwangdian, 20 li northwest of Suixian County, where the Chiang army's Qu Shounian Corps headquarters was located. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's resistance gradually ceased after 3:00 AM on the 2nd, and Chiang's soldiers laid down their weapons one after another. At this time, a tank behind the Corps headquarters still tried to break through and escape. The People's Liberation Army soldiers immediately destroyed the tank's tracks, and the tank could no longer move, but its engine had not stopped, so the soldiers rushed onto the tank. At this moment, an officer with a pale face and dressed in American clothing crawled out of the tank. In a trembling voice, he shouted, \"Please don't shoot, I am Corps Commander Qu Shounian.\" That noon, he was escorted to the front-line headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. On the 4th, the reporter saw Qu Shounian at the reception center for liberated Chiang army officers, at which point he had returned to normal. Qu praised the People's Liberation Army's high morale and fierce artillery fire to the reporter, saying it was completely beyond his expectations. Qu said, \"In general, senior Chiang army generals are very pessimistic about the current war situation. Because of Chiang Kai-shek's erroneous strategic guidance and interference in the command of subordinates, many senior generals feel disappointed and distressed. For example, this time Chiang Kai-shek believed that the People's Liberation Army would not be able to fight continuously after the Battle of Kaifeng. Facts have proven that his judgment was wrong. Secondly, the Kuomintang army's troops only seek self-preservation, and rarely attack during combat; without attack, there is naturally no victory. For example, this time when I was besieged in Longwangmiao, I ordered the 72nd Division in Tiefosi, 15 li away from me, to launch a full-scale attack five times, but they did not move a single step. Moreover, there are contradictions between the troops, and they cannot coordinate with each other during combat. The main reason why Qiu Qingquan's Corps could not provide eastern aid this time was, of course, due to the strong resistance of the People's Liberation Army, but I believe that the contradiction between Qiu and Shen Chengnian also had a great influence. The fact that I was able to become Corps Commander this time is also related to the contradictions between Qiu and Shen. During the Southwest Shandong campaign, Qiu reported to the high command that Shen had disobeyed orders and 'left the battlefield without authorization.' The two have been incompatible ever since. In late June, in order to relieve the siege of Kaifeng, the high command hurriedly ordered me to form this corps. However, I had only been in office for two days, and other subordinates and directly affiliated corps were still in Shangqiu undergoing organization. I and my subordinate generals had not even met each other before we were suddenly surrounded by the People's Liberation Army.\" Shen Chengnian's 75th Division originally belonged to Qiu Qingquan's Corps, and was incorporated into Qu Shounian's Corps this time. It has been completely annihilated by our forces, and Shen himself has also been captured.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军兵团长绥靖副司令　区寿年被俘前后\n\n1948-07-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军兵团长绥靖副司令\n    区寿年被俘前后\n    【新华社豫东前线十四日电】前线记者报导蒋军第六绥副司令兼兵团司令区寿年在豫东大战中被俘经过称：七月一日晚，解放军对蒋军区寿年兵团司令部驻地睢县西北二十里之龙王店发动总攻。经数小时激战，至二日晨三时后，敌人的抵抗逐渐停止，蒋军士兵纷纷放下武器。这时，在兵团司令部后面，有一辆坦克还想突围逃命。解放军战士当即炸毁了坦克的履带，坦克已不能行动，但它的发动机仍没有停止，战士们乃蜂拥登上坦克。这时，从坦克里面钻出来一个面色惨白、全身穿着美式服装的军官，他用发抖的声音呼叫：“请不要打了，我就是兵团司令区寿年。”当天中午，他即被护送到了解放军前线司令部。四日，记者在解放蒋军军官招待处看见了区寿年，这时他已恢复了常态。区向记者盛赞解放军的士气高昂和炮火猛烈，认为完全出于他的意料之外。区说：“一般蒋军高级将领对目前战局的看法都很悲观。因为蒋介石错误的战略指导，和干涉下级指挥，使得许多高级将领感到失望和苦恼。譬如这次蒋介石就认为解放军经过开封之战不能连续作战。事实证明他的判断错了。其次，国民党军的各部队都是只求自保，作战中很少攻击；没有攻击当然就没有胜利可言了。比如这次当我在龙王庙被国时，我曾五次命令离我十五里的铁佛寺七十二师全力出击，但他们一步也不动。而在部队间又互有矛盾，作战时不能协同一致。这次邱清泉兵团不能东援，主要原因当然是由于解放军强有力的阻击，但我认为邱和沈澄年之间的矛盾也很有影响。我这次能当上兵团司令，也是与邱、沈的矛盾有关的。在鲁西南作战时，邱曾呈报统帅部说沈不服从命令，‘擅自脱离战场’。两人从此就不能相容。六月下旬，为了解开封之围，统帅部就很仓促的命我来组成这个兵团。但我到职不过两天，其他僚属和直属各兵团都还留在商邱进行编制中，我和我的所属将领也还没有一一见过面，就突遭解放军包围了。”按沈澄年七十五师原属邱清泉兵团，此次划入区寿年兵团建制，已被我全部歼灭，沈本人亦被俘。"

You said: Chiang Kai-shek had ordered Liu Maoen, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, and Li Zhongxin, Commander of the 66th Division, to \"spare no sacrifice\" to defend Kaifeng to the end, and then immediately sent a large number of American-made aircraft to bomb indiscriminately and aimlessly, even killing and wounding many Kuomintang troops. The 18th Regiment of the 13th Brigade, which was guarding the south city, suffered heavy casualties from the bombing. Cheng Kaijun, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Chiang regime's Henan Air Defense Command, said: \"Our planes (referring to Chiang's planes), in order to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing, recklessly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs in places such as the South Gate and East Gate, causing a large fire. Even the officers and soldiers of our anti-aircraft artillery battalion in the southwest of the city were killed and wounded by the bombing.\" Wang Zhongfu, Deputy Brigade Commander of the First Security Brigade of Henan Province under Chiang's regime, pointed out that Chiang's planes were bombing indiscriminately without any target, saying: \"When I led my troops to fight on Freedom Road, the planes were bombing nearby; the area around Xiaonanmen and Nanguan was bombed into a sea of fire, a tragic sight. Xiangguo Temple had no fighting at the time and no People's Liberation Army, but it was also bombed and caught fire.\" Sun Xitang, Deputy Brigade Commander of the Second Security Brigade of Henan Province, also said: \"As a result of the indiscriminate bombing by the planes, many civilians were killed near the provincial government, and even the provincial government building, which was still being defended by us (referring to the Chiang army) at the time, was hit by two large bombs.\" Zhang Jie, Brigade Commander of the 13th Brigade of the 66th Division, confessed that the large-scale arson and burning of civilian houses by the unit was also one of the causes of the major fire in Kaifeng.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 被俘高级蒋军官供认　蒋军轰炸开封惨状\n\n1948-07-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　被俘高级蒋军官供认\n    蒋军轰炸开封惨状\n    【新华社开封前线十二日电】开封战役被俘的蒋军高级军官六十六师参谋长游凌云等，供认此次蒋军狂炸及破坏开封之种种残暴事实，有力地揭穿了蒋匪连日对于这一罪行的掩饰。游说：蒋介石曾命令河南省府主席刘茂恩及六十六师师长李仲辛，对开封应“不惜一切牺牲”，坚守到底，并随即派来大批美造飞机，毫无目的地乱肆轰炸，连国民党部队也被炸死伤很多，守南城十三旅十八团就被炸伤亡很大。蒋记河南防空指挥部少将副指挥官程开俊说：“我机（指蒋机）为阻挡解放军前进，不顾一切在南门及东门等地乱投炸弹及燃烧弹，引起了大火。连我们在城西南的高射炮营官兵也有被炸死炸伤的。”蒋记河南省保安第一旅副旅长王忠辅指明蒋机漫无目标的滥炸时称：“我带部队在自由路作战时，飞机就在附近轰炸；小南门及南关一带炸成一片火海，惨不忍睹。相国寺当时并无战事，也无解放军，亦被炸起火。”河南保安二旅副旅长孙喜堂亦称：“由于飞机乱炸的结果，在省府附近炸死了许多平民，连当时尚为我们（指蒋军）据守的省府大楼也中了两颗大炸弹。”六十六师十三旅旅长张洁供认：该部大肆纵火燃烧民房，亦为酿成开封城大火原因之一。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-17",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Taihang News] Xiaoxi Village, Fourth District, Neiqiu, reviewed and summarized its agricultural and sideline production for the first half of the year in late June. Based on voluntary organization, the village has completed wheat harvesting, sowing, and weeding according to plan. The original plan was to cultivate 74 mu of wasteland, but the result was 98.7 mu. The number of livestock increased by 47 compared to last winter. Transportation, herb digging, weaving, silkworm rearing, and firewood gathering earned a total of more than 450,000 yuan (Jibi currency, same below). According to the villagers' research, the reasons why the villagers actively cultivate and develop production are, in addition to continuously carrying out policy propaganda and stabilizing the production mood of all strata, mainly: First, problems in mutual aid for labor can be solved in a timely manner. The village formed a unified large work team under truly democratic and voluntary combination, divided into two teams and six groups, under the unified leadership of the village's production committee (whether this unified large work team can fully guarantee the principle of equal value and voluntariness is questionable. And recent experiences in various places have proven that this kind of large-scale mutual aid is rarely successful, and the masses greatly welcome small-scale mutual aid - editor). Labor hero An Jiuren and other village cadres participated in each group to provide specific leadership and assistance. A major dispute once occurred in the Anquanlai group, and someone left the group, threatening the collapse of mutual aid. Comrade An Jiuren immediately went to the group to talk to the members, and also convened a group meeting to review the situation face to face, and found that the main reason for the dispute was Anquanlai's own mistakes: An Zhendong and other three group members were originally qualified for seven points of labor, but they were given five points. The whole group used the same water, and others only watered three times, while Quanlai watered seven times. When watering the families of soldiers, he went to water his own after only a short while. The group members raised their opinions to him face to face, but he did not accept them. Jiuren did not directly criticize Quanlai at the time, but first reviewed his own lack of help to the Quanlai group, which led to Quanlai's problems. Under Jiuren's influence, Quanlai also apologized to the group members face to face. After everyone's discussion, An Zhendong and others were all raised to seven points. An Shengyuan and other two people who had withdrawn from the group due to dissatisfaction saw that the problems were solved and returned to the group. Another time, in the Lao Zhang group, because the education committee member Li Kuixiao was originally seven points of labor, but he insisted on raising it to eight points, which caused many opinions among the group members. After timely review and correction, people's emotions were revitalized. Second, labor is used appropriately, and accounts are cleared in a timely manner. When encountering tasks such as sowing, reclaiming wasteland, harvesting wheat, and weeding, labor is uniformly and centrally used; after the task is completed, it is immediately dispersed into group activities, and the whole village uses unified work tickets. When going to the field to work, the group members carry their work tickets with them. After the work is completed, they democratically evaluate each person's labor and skills, the speed and quality of the work, and clear the work tickets on the spot. Once a task (such as sowing) is completed, the accounts are settled immediately, wages are paid to long-term workers, and debts are settled without delay. Everyone is very satisfied. Third, life is well arranged, and labor and time can be squeezed out to engage in sideline occupations. After completing the sowing with a drill in the spring, they immediately turned to accumulating fertilizer, threshing, and weeding wheat. After calculating, each group had spare labor. An Jiuren suggested that each laborer cultivate one mu of wasteland to subsidize the annual burden; nine people were drawn to Shanxi to dig herbs, and five people went to Zhao County to sell used clothes. Everyone agreed and did so, earning 48,000 yuan from herb digging, exceeding the wasteland reclamation plan; although selling used clothes did not make money, it helped the masses to change seasons. Later, when the spring seedlings should be weeded, they immediately concentrated their efforts on weeding. After a thorough rain, they quickly organized replanting. Every season, they ensure that labor is not wasted and agricultural work is not delayed. Fourth, the village's various organizations can play their due role. When the middle peasants were panicked and uneasy due to misunderstanding the Land Law, the Culture and Education Committee used civil schools, mutual aid groups, and weaving groups to organize discussions everywhere on the policies towards the middle peasants stipulated by Chairman Mao, which played a significant role. During a certain period, several \"sharp heads\" (people who like to take advantage) in the village deliberately found fault and engaged in extreme democracy. They resisted things that the masses should do. The Culture and Education Committee organized everyone to discuss what democracy is and whether democracy should not have centralized leadership. The peasants all said, \"In the past ten years of the War of Resistance, nothing bad has ever happened in our village; if we mess around like this (referring to extreme democracy), I don't know what will happen!\" The \"sharp heads\" were criticized by everyone and dared not make trouble. There was a time when there was no cotton, and the spinning wheels were idle; at another time, women had disputes due to the uneven quality of the yarn and cloth they handed in, and the mediation committee was responsible for resolving them well. Some women did not know how to repair spinning wheels and looms, and the thread broke while weaving, and the four experts from the technical guidance group went to the various groups to help, solving the difficulties and promoting weaving.\n    The summary also criticized some shortcomings in the work in the past six months, such as not praising some good examples, not checking and urging enough after assigning work to some groups, and not actively educating and improving the unenthusiastic members of some groups, only saying that they were backward.... It was decided that these would be worked hard to overcome in future production.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Neiqiu Joint Office)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 健全领导适当安排生活勤算工帐随时解决问题  小西村总结半年生产经验\n\n1948-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　健全领导适当安排生活勤算工帐随时解决问题\n    小西村总结半年生产经验\n    【太行讯】内邱四区小西村在六月下旬检讨总结前半年农副业生产。该村在自愿组织起来的基础上，麦收、下种与锄苗等都已按计划完成。原计划开荒七十四亩，结果开了九十八亩七。牲口较去冬增加四十七头。运输、刨药、纺织、养蚕、打柴等共赚洋四十五万余元（冀钞，下同）。该村农民积极耕作、发展生产的原因，据大家研究，除不断进行政策宣传、稳定各阶层生产情绪外；主要是：第一、拨工互助中有问题能及时解决。该村在真正民主自愿结合下，全村组成一个统一的大拨工队，下分两个中队，六个小组，由村的生产委员会统一领导（全村组织一个统一的大拨工队，其中能否完全保证等价自愿的原则？运用起来是否方便？均可怀疑。而最近各地经验均在证明这种大型互助搞好的很少，群众则十分欢迎小型互助——编者）。劳动英雄安九仁及其他村干分头参加各组，具体领导帮助。安全来组有一次发生大纠纷，有人退了组，互助眼看要垮台，安九仁同志马上跑到组里找组员们谈话，又召集组员会当面检讨，发现纠纷的主要原因是安全来自己有错误：安振德等三个组员本来够上七分劳力，却给人家评成五分。全组伙用一道水，别人才浇了三水，全来就浇了七水。给军属浇水时，浇了不多一会，他就又去浇自己的了。组员们当面给他提出意见，他不接受。九仁当时没有直接批评全来，先检讨自己对全来组帮助不够，以致全来发生了毛病。全来在九仁影响下，也当面向组员认了错。经过大家讨论，把安振德等都提到七分。因不满而退了组的安生元等二人，看见问题都解决了，又重新回到组里。又一次，老张组因为教育委员李奎小本来是七分劳力，他自己硬要提到八分，组员们发生了许多意见。经过及时检讨改正，人们的情绪又重新活跃起来。第二，使用劳力适当，清帐及时。遇到下种、开荒、麦收、锄苗等任务，就统一集中使用劳力；完成任务后，马上分散为小组活动，全村使用统一工票。去地做活时，组员都随身带着工票，做完了即民主评议各人的劳力、技术，做的快慢好坏，当场开清工票。一次任务（如下种）完成，马上算帐，长工的使工资，欠工的出工资，毫不拖拉。大家都很满意。第三，生活安排的好，能挤出劳力与时间搞副业。春季完成耧地下种，马上转向积肥、打＠、锄麦。各组计算了一下，都剩出了劳力。安九仁便提议每个劳力开生荒一亩，补助全年负担；抽九人到山西刨药，五人到赵县贩估衣。大家同意，照着做了，刨药赚洋四万八，开荒超过计划；估衣虽未赚钱，却帮助了群众换季。以后春苗该锄了，立刻集中力量锄苗。下了透雨，很快又组织了补种。每个季节都做到不浪费劳力，不耽误农活。第四，村里各个组织能发挥自己应有的作用。文教委员会当着中农因不了解土地法而恐慌不安时，就利用民校、互助组、纺织组到处组织讨论毛主席所规定的对中农的政策，起了不小作用。有个时期村里几个“尖头”（好占便宜的人）故意挑毛病，搞极端民主，应该群众做的事他偏抵抗，文教委员会就组织大家讨论什么是民主，民主是否不要集中的领导。农民们都说：“抗战十来年了，咱村什么事也没闹坏过；要这样乱捣蛋（指极端民主），不知道要闹成什么样哩！”“尖头”受到大家批评，不敢闹了。有一时期没了棉花，纺车都闲起来了；又一时期妇女们因交的线和布好坏不等闹纠纷，调解委员会都负责很好的解决了。有的妇女不会修理纺车和织机，织布断了线没办法，技术指导组的四个能手便分头到各组帮助，解决了困难，推进了纺织。\n    总结时也批判了半年来工作上一些缺点，如有些好的榜样没有表扬，有的组布置工作后检查督促不够，有的组对不积极的组员没主动教育提高，光说人家落后……。这些都决定在今后生产中努力克服。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（内邱联合办公室）"

The notice pointed out: The reason why our Jilu Yu Region has seen the emergence of \"leftist\" adventurist deviations during land reform is mainly due to unclear leadership thinking and undefined policy boundaries. In implementing certain specific Party policies, the overall line and general policies of the Party are sometimes forgotten. In order to resolutely, correctly, and unreservedly implement all the lines and policies of our Party Central Committee, and to raise awareness and improve work, organizing and leading Party cadres in study should become one of the current political tasks. In the future, work reports from higher and lower levels should include information on cadre study, and the quality of each cadre's study should be listed as one of the criteria for evaluating work performance. It is stipulated that the following four documents should be the central documents for study by cadres at all levels: \"Central Committee's 1948 Instructions on Land Reform and Party Rectification,\" the *North China People's Daily* editorial \"The Current Tasks of the North China Liberated Area,\" \"Preface to the Reprint of *Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder*,\" and \"*Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder*, Chapter Two,\" and \"Lenin on How Soviet Officials Should Work.\" The study period will be one month to one and a half months. The study method mainly involves understanding the spirit and essence of the documents, connecting with reality, connecting with oneself, and conducting work and ideological self-criticism. The Hebei Construction Region will adhere to and restore the two-hour study system, with most studying collectively. Henan and border regions will adopt a study day system or a rotating study system, where part of the staff works and part studies. Cadres above the district level will focus on self-study, while those below the district level will adopt the method of large lectures. Village-level and individual small-area cadres will undergo short-term rotational training, organized by the county. Responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels and administrative heads of all departments must lead by example and take the lead personally. Party committees' directly affiliated organs will establish study committees based on general branches or branches, and study groups will be combined with Party life groups.

    "content": "Opposing Empiricism\n    Ai Siqi\n  　　　　　(I)\n    The CPC Central Committee's \"Instructions on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948\" proposed opposing empiricist work methods. The Central Propaganda Department reprinted the preface to Chapter 2 of \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder, calling on all party cadres to \"quickly overcome certain serious states of indiscipline or anarchism, localism or empiricism in their work.\" The two documents identify empiricism as a major incorrect way of thinking among our cadres, pointing out that this way of thinking has caused many serious errors in practical work and has caused losses to the Chinese people in their cause of striving for the victory of the national democratic revolution. Therefore, our cadres must take opposing empiricism as one of the main subjects in their current studies.\n    Empiricism is a kind of subjectivism, and it is completely contrary to the Marxist dialectical materialism. If a Communist Party member's way of thinking is dominated by subjectivism, he cannot maintain a strong party spirit, and he cannot become a truly Marxist revolutionary. In order to oppose subjectivism, in May 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong gave a speech on \"Reform Our Study,\" and in January 1942, he gave another speech on \"Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing,\" and led the whole party in a rectification movement. In the speech \"Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing,\" Chairman Mao emphasized that \"opposing subjectivism to rectify the style of study\" was put forward as the \"first very important issue\" of the rectification movement.\n    Chairman Mao said: \"There are two kinds of subjectivism in our party, one is dogmatism, and the other is empiricism.\" To oppose subjectivism, we must oppose dogmatism on the one hand, and empiricism on the other hand, that is, to correctly grasp Marxism. The so-called correct grasp of Marxism, according to Comrade Mao Zedong, is \"the combination of the universal truth of Marxism and the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution,\" that is, the combination of Marxist theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Subjectivism does not have such a combination. Subjectivism is the separation of the universal truth of Marxism from the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the separation of theoretical knowledge from practical experience. The split of dogmatism lies in the fact that it is only satisfied with the theoretical knowledge in books and makes the theoretical knowledge in books absolute. Regardless of time, place, purpose, object, and other specific conditions, it uses simple book knowledge as a magic weapon to conquer everything, blindly and mechanically uses this magic weapon everywhere to solve various different specific problems, and completely despises all the valuable experience in the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and the theory summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong from this experience. It completely does not understand that theory itself is also a summary of practical experience, and the general theoretical knowledge learned in books can only serve as a guide to help us summarize our own experience. The split of empiricism lies in the fact that it is only satisfied with the local experience within its own narrow scope of work, and it is unwilling to learn the experience of all aspects, and it will not concentrate and adhere to the universal experience, and will not summarize these experiences under the guidance of general theory. Therefore, it cannot understand the theory summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong from the actual experience of the Chinese revolution. Whether it is dogmatism or empiricism, it can only possess partial revolutionary knowledge, and cannot grasp comprehensive Marxist knowledge; and if it cannot grasp comprehensive Marxist knowledge, it cannot have true Marxist knowledge. Such a person who lacks Marxist knowledge is often very proud and self-righteous subjectively, thinking that he is a perfect revolutionary, but in actual work, he often makes many wrong behaviors that are beneficial to the enemy and harmful to the people.\n    Chairman Mao said: \"We oppose subjectivism, we must make the above two kinds of people develop in the direction they lack, we must make the two kinds of people combine with each other. People with book knowledge should develop towards the practical aspect, so that they can not stop at book knowledge, and can not commit the error of dogmatism. People with work experience should study towards the theoretical aspect, should read books seriously, so that experience can be brought with orderliness, comprehensiveness, and rise to theory, so that the local experience can not be mistaken for the universal truth, and can not commit the error of empiricism. Dogmatism and empiricism are both subjectivism, which originate from different extremes.\" (Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing)\n    　　　　(II)\n    The rectification movement after 1942 achieved great results. Under the call of the rectification, many comrades with book knowledge went to practice, or engaged in practical research work, and many cadres with practical experience also began to work hard to improve their cultural level and theoretical knowledge. The two kinds of people and the two kinds of partial knowledge began to turn from separation to combination, and the ideological level of many cadres was improved as a result. A group of cadres and leaders who have both rich revolutionary experience and can grasp theoretical guidance was produced in the party, which has become one of the main factors for the development of the Chinese revolutionary war and various revolutionary movements to national victory today. Regarding such a fact, Chairman Mao made a summary in his speech \"The Current Situation and Our Tasks\" on December 25 last year: \"The rectification movement has generally achieved results. The main achievement is that it has enabled our leading organs and many cadres to further grasp the unity of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, such a basic direction.\"\n    However, it must be noted that Chairman Mao only said here that the rectification movement has \"generally achieved results,\" not that, after the rectification movement, the thinking of the party cadres has been completely free of problems, or that subjectivism has been completely eliminated. No, that's not the case. The problem of subjectivism must continue to be worked hard to completely overcome; the remnants of dogmatism still play a bad role in the thinking of some cadres; especially empiricism, is still the main danger that must be overcome in the way of thinking of many comrades in practical work today.\n    The rectification movement in 1942 especially emphasized opposing dogmatism, because at that time, the main danger in the way of thinking in the party was dogmatism. Among the two kinds of subjectivism, dogmatism occupied the main position. Chairman Mao said about the situation at that time: \"At present, the most dangerous thing in our party is still dogmatism. Because dogmatism is most likely to pretend to be Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, scare the worker and peasant cadres, capture the bumpkins, and use them as their own servants, and the worker and peasant cadres are not easy to see through their faces. It can also scare innocent and romantic young people and use them as prisoners.\" Therefore, since the rectification movement, the focus of the struggle against the two kinds of subjectivism has been on opposing dogmatism, and the results achieved in this regard are relatively large. The anti-Marxist face of dogmatism has been recognized more clearly by the general cadres, and it has lost its power and no longer has the power to scare worker and peasant cadres and capture young people. Of course, dogmatism still has many remnants today. For example, when many cadres implement the party's policies, they still do not know how to combine general calls with individual solutions, and they still do not pay attention to understanding the specific environment and conditions at the time and place. They do not know how to adopt different steps to realize these policies according to various different specific environmental conditions. Many cadres still cannot get rid of the bad habits of commandism and bureaucratism, and bring general calls and general policies rigidly into various working environments; they often adopt coercive methods to force the masses to accept these calls and policies, and will not gradually guide the masses to raise their level of consciousness and voluntarily accept them. These are concrete forms of dogmatism manifested in current practical work. However, on the whole, dogmatism is no longer in the main position as it was in those years.\n    The situation of empiricism is somewhat different. In the rectification movement, empiricism was also criticized, but because the focus at that time was on opposing dogmatism, many comrades did not recognize the anti-Marxist nature of empiricism very thoroughly, and they did not have sufficient estimation and attention to the harm it caused. This is the first. Secondly, the guerrilla warfare over the years and the scattered environment in which the revolutionary base areas were divided into many independent units, made the thinking of many comrades bound by the narrow scope of work, and made them accustomed to considering and solving problems from the conditions and experience of individual places, and were not good at considering and solving problems from the perspective of the overall situation of the revolution, and were not good at linking the problems of local areas with the party's general line and policies. Due to the above two subjective and objective reasons, empiricism has become an important wrong way of thinking in the work of many of our cadres today. After focusing on opposing dogmatism, opposing empiricism has become the main aspect of opposing the subjective ideological method. Under the current situation of the development of the Chinese revolution, striving to overcome empiricism has become our urgent task. In the \"Preface\" to Chapter 2 of \"Left-Wing\" Communism, reprinted by the Central Propaganda Department, the current revolutionary situation is described as follows: \"Due to the victory of the People's Liberation Army, our Chinese Communist Party (⑴⑵) is in power in an area with a population of 160 million and is connected to some extent. There is no doubt that, with the victory of the revolution, our party will become the leading party of the unified national people's democratic regime.\" The task given to our party by this situation is: \"The revolutionary situation in the country requires that our entire party and army be completely unified in all political, military, and economic policies, and the administrative system and administrative organs also require that the necessary and possible unification be gradually implemented. It is necessary to appropriately reduce the autonomy of various places and corps, and unify all powers that can be unified and must be unified in the country under the leadership of the central government, in order to concentrate forces to carry out the national-scale liberation war and start various new constructions in politics, economy, and culture.\" Obviously, such a situation and task require the cadres in various places and departments to transcend the shackles of the narrow scope of work in their thinking, and learn to consider and solve various important issues in connection with the overall trend of the current Chinese revolution, and learn to combine the concrete individual problems under a certain scope or certain conditions with the party's general line and policies. However, if the cadres in various places and departments still maintain the empiricist way of thinking, if their thinking is still only stopped in the circle of individual local conditions and local experience, and forget the party's general line and policies, then this way of thinking will undoubtedly conflict with the party's requirements for unified leadership under the current situation, and there will be a tendency to localism and indiscipline, which will hinder the realization of the correct line and policies.\n    　　　　(III)\n    The \"Preface\" of the Central Propaganda Department says: \"In the past, due to the long-term guerrilla warfare and the scattered environment in which the revolutionary base areas were divided into many independent units, in each unit, there were various differences in the enemy situation, terrain, and political and economic conditions. Therefore, we had to highly develop locality and highly develop the local autonomy of each unit, and thus highly develop the local enthusiasm and creativity of each unit, overcome the extremely complicated difficulties at that time, and push the Chinese revolution towards the victory of the national scale. This was a completely necessary and correct policy at that time. However, precisely because of this, a habit of decentralism or localism has been created in many of our comrades, and some serious states of indiscipline or anarchism have been created in the party, which are wrong and harmful.\" It is necessary to pay attention to the characteristics of a certain place and a certain department. This is one aspect. But on the other hand, many comrades in their work often excessively emphasize the \"specialness\" of a certain place and a certain department; or, with the thinking of tailism, they believe uncritically that \"whatever the masses want to do, do it\"; and use these as excuses to violate the principles of Marxism-Leninism, refuse to implement the instructions of the superiors, and refuse to implement the party's general line and policies in a step-by-step manner. This has undermined the party's leadership and discipline, and has formed an ideological obstacle to the party's requirements for national unified leadership. This shows that empiricism has become the ideological basis of localism or decentralism, indiscipline or anarchism, and the habit of certain localism or decentralism, certain states of indiscipline or anarchism has become a condition for the stubborn existence of empiricism. Therefore, in the struggle to overcome localism or decentralism, indiscipline or anarchism, we must simultaneously fight against empiricism ideologically.\n    Opposing empiricism is certainly not to admit or return to dogmatism in any sense, nor is it to deny the value of all practical revolutionary work experience. On the contrary, Marxists attach great importance to all beneficial revolutionary experiences, and the various theories of Marxism are precisely the summary of various aspects of revolutionary experience. Marxist theory is by no means an accidental discovery of the mysterious genius brain, but the centralization and systematization of the struggle experience of the proletariat and all the people. Therefore, the problem is not in the experience itself, but in whether we can analyze the experience, summarize the experience, and find out the knowledge of the laws of the development of events and the solution of problems from the experience. The problem of empiricism lies in stopping in the circle of scattered and fragmented experiences, and not raising the experience to theory to guide our revolutionary struggle. People with empiricist problems are often short-sighted, cannot see the overall situation, and cannot see the past, present, and future of the development of events. Therefore, it is impossible to do theoretical, guiding, foresighted, and planned work.\n    The empiricist way of thinking and working method are quite common in many of our cadres. For example: First, they are only satisfied with the local experience within the narrow scope of work, and are unwilling to learn new experiences in all aspects with an open mind. The disadvantage is that they cannot flexibly change the work methods under the circumstances where the time, place, and conditions have changed, and they stubbornly move unsuitable or old experiences to apply them. For example, transplanting the methods of anti-feudal struggle in rural areas to cities, and transplanting the experience of scattered and independent work during the long-term guerrilla warfare to the current situation where the liberated areas have been largely connected into one piece. Second, their eyes are full of various scattered and fragmented experiences, swaying left and right with different experiences, and they cannot maintain initiative in thinking and work. They cannot use scientific minds to analyze and summarize the diverse and complex experiences. For example, the tailism in the mass movement emphasizes that everything should listen to the opinions of the masses, and abandons the necessary leadership and education of the proletariat party to the masses. Another example is the empiricist meeting method pointed out in the \"Instructions on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948\": \"Without any preparation beforehand, no questions are raised, no questions are analyzed, and no meticulously prepared content and words are reported to the cadres, allowing the attendees to make aimless, chaotic discussions, resulting in prolonged meeting time and no thorough conclusions.\" In addition, the one-sided and isolated reports popular in our current news communication work are also one of the reflections of this empiricism; this kind of report fills our newspapers with individual details of a person or an event at a time and place (of course, there is no doubt that there are many valuable and necessary things to be published in these detailed reports), but it cannot tell us the overall trend, dynamics, progress of the movement, and contradictions in the movement (on the one hand, there are achievements and correct things, and on the other hand, there are difficulties and wrong things) of any important issue within any vast scope, the crux of the production of these contradictions and the key to solving them. The reason why all these methods are called empiricist is precisely because they only see the trees and not the forest, only see the individual and not the general, and are dominated by scattered and fragmented experiences, and cannot summarize them and raise them to theory. This empiricism in the way of thinking becomes clericalism in the way of working. Third, some comrades adopt a more junior and completely unprincipled position. They seem to regard themselves as a treasure trove of experience, storing various different and even contradictory experiences in it, and do not distinguish the correctness and error of these experiences. They only look at what you want and take out what you want. This empiricism is often a supplement to the leadership of dogmatic bureaucratism. With the help of these empiricists, dogmatists and bureaucrats can be high above and find \"empirical\" proof for any of their claims and any \"instructions.\" The reason why empiricism becomes a prisoner of dogmatism is precisely because it has such a blindness.\n    　　(IV)\n    To oppose empiricism, we must learn to summarize experience and raise scattered and fragmented perceptual knowledge to theoretical knowledge with comprehensiveness and orderliness.\n    To be able to summarize experience, we must first learn the experience of all aspects, and do not only satisfy the narrow experience. Listening to the opinions of various masses can help us learn the experience of all aspects. Therefore, learning from the masses is very important. However, summarizing experience is not equal to the simple accumulation of various experiences, but must go through analysis and research. Analysis and research also require the guidance of correct methods. Therefore, we must first learn the methods of summarizing experience and analyzing and researching various phenomena. That is, we must learn Marxist dialectical materialism and its theory of social development and class analysis. Empiricism lacks this kind of analysis and research under the guidance of Marxist theory. Our experience, in general, is nothing more than the experience of the proletariat party leading the people to fight against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. The masses of the people contain many classes—workers, peasants, intellectuals, small and medium-sized bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, etc. The Chinese Communist Party unites these classes through its various programs and policies to oppose the landlord class and bureaucratic bourgeoisie that represent imperialism and feudal forces. To analyze experience, we must identify the faces of all classes in the revolutionary struggle, their various demands, trends, and whether our policies can guide them to play an active role in the revolutionary movement. To conduct such analysis and research, it is impossible without the guidance of Marxist class theory. The same class can have various demands in the struggle. These demands play different and even opposite roles in the revolution. For example, peasants demand the equal distribution of land and feudal property, and the overthrow of the feudal landlord class. This demand has a revolutionary progressive effect, which we should approve. However, among the peasants, there is also a kind of absolute egalitarian distribution of thought; this absolute egalitarianism not only destroys the feudal land and property relations, but also uses egalitarian methods to destroy the land and property relations of middle peasants and new rich peasants, and uses egalitarian methods to destroy urban and rural capitalist industry and commerce. This is a kind of agricultural socialist thought, a backward and reactionary thought, which we must oppose. To analyze experience, we must distinguish the different demands of these classes and their different roles, and how to determine appropriate policies to guide the masses to play their progressive revolutionary demands and roles, and prevent and correct their wrong demands and roles. Without the class analysis method as a guide, it is impossible to do such research. Empiricists replace the led mass line with tailism, believing that all the opinions of the masses are correct. One of the sources of this error is the lack of class analysis methods.\n    To learn to summarize experience, we must also be able to analyze the conditions on which various experiences are based. If experience tells us that a certain policy has been very effective when implemented in a certain place and at a certain time, but has not been very effective or even has many bad results in another place and at another time, then we must understand the reasons why these different results occur, and we must analyze the various subjective and objective conditions at that time and place. After such analysis, we may draw a conclusion and determine that a certain policy must be implemented under certain conditions. The \"Instructions on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948\" determined that land reform must be implemented in places where the three conditions are fully met (stable environment, the majority of the basic masses already have land reform requirements, and cadres can definitely master the land reform work in quantity and quality), and in places where these conditions are not fully met, they should not be included in the scope of land reform work. Such a decision is the result of analyzing the experience of all aspects of land reform work.\n    Since the Party Central Committee issued the decision on investigation and research in July 1941, many organizations of the Party have generally recognized the importance of investigation, research, and summarizing experience, and have done a lot of work and accumulated a lot of materials in this regard. However, many comrades still do not know how to correctly investigate, research, and summarize experience. Many of our comrades still lack analytical methods, so they often accumulate a large amount of materials, but still cannot raise questions, solve problems, and even attribute the reason to the lack of materials. Chairman Mao once used the metaphor of killing pigs to ask these comrades: Does the pig killer have to kill all kinds of pigs in the world, kill all big pigs, small pigs, male pigs, female pigs, black pigs, white pigs, fancy pigs, Chinese pigs, foreign pigs, and then summarize the experience of killing pigs? No, an ordinary pig can represent all ordinary pigs. The age, gender, color, and nationality of the pig are meaningless to the method of killing pigs. Similarly, leaving aside all meaningless superficial phenomena, a truly typical thing can also represent general similar things. If a truly scientific analysis is made of this typical thing, it is completely possible to discover the necessary problems and propose the correct solutions. Of course, the differences between social things are more complicated than the differences between pigs, and this raises the task of selecting typical things, the task of selecting several typical things to represent several situations, the task of judging whether certain things have universality and essentiality, and all of this is called analysis. Seeing only the trees and not the forest is a manifestation of the empiricist method; but in order to see the forest, counting the trees one by one is still a manifestation of the empiricist method, and still does not achieve the purpose of seeing the forest. In order to understand the forest, it is necessary to observe the whole picture of the forest and study one or several trees that make up the forest. Similarly, in order to understand a social thing, it is also necessary to observe its whole picture and study one or several of its typical things. In this way, we can propose general instructions for solving problems, and we do not need to wait until all the experiences are collected, to \"wait for a few months, or half a year, or even longer, before the lower level makes a summary report to the upper level, and the upper level makes a general instruction to the lower level,\" as the method popular in many organizations of the Party today. This method is also a wrong and must be corrected empiricist method. In addition, due to the lack of analytical methods, when our comrades summarize their experiences, they often, as Chairman Mao said in his speech \"Oppose Party Stereotypes,\" \"do not think about the essence of the problem, but are satisfied with the enumeration of the phenomena of A, B, C, and D,\" \"do not raise questions, do not analyze questions, do not solve questions, do not express what they agree with, what they oppose, and what they say is still a Chinese medicine shop, with no real content.\" In this way, even if summary reports and general instructions are made, they are still not helpful to the work, and the problems are still not solved. From this, it can be seen that although the work of investigation, research, and summarizing experience has been done, if we do not get rid of the shackles of empiricism and do not learn analytical methods, then we still cannot improve our work, still cannot grasp the dynamics in time, solve problems, and exchange experiences, correct errors, and promote achievements. That is to say, we still cannot get rid of the error of subjectivism.\n    　　(V)\n    What should our leading cadres do in order to oppose empiricism?\n    The first thing that should be advocated is to use all possible means to study Marxist-Leninist theory, to study philosophy (dialectical materialism, especially historical materialism) and political economy. Comrades with practical work experience must make further efforts to seize the time to study Marxist-Leninist books. In many of our comrades, there is still a lack of a strong atmosphere of \"reading seriously.\" Since the rectification, some comrades have also produced a wrong idea, thinking that all reading and translation are \"dogmatism,\" and denying the value of all book theoretical knowledge. This wrong idea is enough to hinder the progress and improvement of the party's theoretical level. Drilling into the horns of the books, not knowing how to combine certain knowledge in the books with practice, to help summarize practical experience and solve practical problems, this is dogmatism. Opposing dogmatism is not opposing reading books, but opposing the separation of this book theoretical knowledge from practical experience. Marxist-Leninist books are the summary of the international experience of the proletariat leading the revolutionary movement. From these books, we can learn many universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, learn the theory of socio-economic development and the theory of class analysis, learn the specific application of the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method, that is, learn how Marx and Lenin solved various specific problems. The rectification movement is to ask us to study the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, that is, to ask us to learn to use these universal truths as guidance to summarize the experience of the Chinese revolution and raise it to the correct theory to guide the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, we must follow the instructions given by Comrade Mao Zedong in the report of the rectification movement. In the possible fixed time, \"read books seriously.\" We should especially seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works. It should be said that Comrade Mao Zedong's works are also a summary of the international experience of the proletariat leading the revolutionary movement in a certain sense, and are a part of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong's works especially summarize the experiences of various periods and aspects of the Chinese revolutionary movement, and are therefore the best model for us to learn to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.\n    Second, we must seriously study the party's program, line, and policies. One of the characteristics of empiricism is that it does not pay attention to the study of these programs, lines, and policies. Therefore, they are often forgotten in practical actions, or only remember some individual specific lines and policies, and forget the general lines and policies. This makes many comrades constantly sway left and right when implementing policies. The so-called serious study is naturally not to recite the documents word for word, or to copy the documents word for word regardless of the circumstances. It should be pointed out that, contrary to the methods of dogmatists and empiricists, the central instructions and documents always carefully distinguish different situations and propose different work tasks and work methods, and repeatedly educate cadres to implement them according to specific situations. The central government stipulates that if the party organizations in various places find that \"if there are parts of these documents that are not suitable for the local situation, they can and should put forward opinions for revision, but they must obtain the consent of the central government before they can implement the revision.\" Today's serious situation is mainly not in reciting or copying the central documents word for word (which is undoubtedly wrong), but in that many cadres do not seriously study and strictly implement the central documents at all. Instead, they arbitrarily use the excuse of the specialness of the situation, and arbitrarily revise the policies of the central government or the superiors, and implement wrong policies that they think are correct. They neither ask for instructions in advance nor report afterwards. This forms some serious states of indiscipline or anarchism. Therefore, opposing the neglect of the central instructions and documents, and requiring cadres to conduct serious and detailed study of the central documents in order to thoroughly understand the central line and policies and deeply understand the central way of thinking, is a necessary condition for overcoming empiricism.\n    Third, in addition to the above two methods, in order to overcome empiricism, we must also advocate all party cadres to learn to correctly investigate and study in their own work, analyze situations, analyze experiences, and cultivate the habit of concretely analyzing concrete problems anytime and anywhere. Marxist-Leninist works, Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and central instructions and documents, after all, cannot give specific answers to every problem we encounter in our daily work. On the contrary, all these works and documents resolutely require us to think independently and resolutely oppose those lazy people who seek ready-made ideas. Chairman Mao said: \"Although some people have the advantage of contacting the masses, they are not good at thinking, and are unwilling to use their brains to think hard, and as a result, they still cannot accomplish anything. Lenin often advised people to be good at thinking, and we should also advise people in this way.\" As mentioned earlier, the general habit of investigation, research, and summarizing experience is now in the party, but what is lacking is the method of analysis; and the main purpose of advocating the study of Marxist-Leninist works, Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and central instructions and documents is to learn this method of analysis. This study requires not only serious reading but also practical application. Concretely analyzing concrete problems is the soul of Marxism-Leninism, the key to correctly implementing the central line and policies, and the weapon that all our party cadres cannot leave for a moment in their daily work. If we learn to use this weapon, we will be able to get rid of both dogmatism and empiricism.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对经验主义\n艾思奇\n1948-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对经验主义\n    艾思奇\n  　　　　　（一）\n    中共中央“关于一九四八年土地改革和整党工作的指示”里，提出要反对经验主义的工作方法。中央宣传部重印左派幼稚病第二章的前言，号召全党干部“迅速克服工作中的某些严重的无纪律状态或无政府状态，地方主义或经验主义。”两个文件把经验主义作为目前我们干部中一种主要的不正确的思想方法，指出这种思想方法在实际工作中曾经造成了许多严重的错误，并使中国人民在争取全国民主革命胜利的事业中遭受了损失。因此，我们的干部必须把反对经验主义作为目前学习中的主要课题之一。\n    经验主义是主观主义的一种，它和马克思主义的辩证法唯物论是完全背道而驰的。一个共产党员的思想方法如果为主观主义所支配，他就不可能保持坚强的党性，就不可能成为真正马克思主义的革命者。为着反对主观主义，一九四一年五月，毛泽东同志作了“改造我们的学习”的演讲，一九四二年一月，又作了“整顿学风党风文风”的演讲，并领导全党进行了整风运动。在“整顿学风党风文风”的演讲里，毛主席很强调地把“反对主观主义以整顿学风”当作整风运动的“第一个非常重要的问题”提了出来。\n    毛主席说：“我们党中的主观主义有两种，一种是教条主义，一种是经验主义。”反对主观主义，就是一方面要反对教条主义，而另一方面又要反对经验主义，就是要正确地掌握马克思主义。所谓正确地掌握马克思主义，按照毛泽东同志的说法，就是“马克思主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践的结合”，就是马克思主义的理论知识与实际经验的结合。主观主义却没有这样的一种结合。主观主义就是马克思主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践的分裂，就是理论知识与实际经验的分裂。教条主义的分裂，就在于它仅仅满足于书本的理论知识，并使书本的理论知识绝对化，不问时间、地点、目的、对象以及其他具体条件如何，把单纯的书本知识做为征服一切的法宝，盲目地机械地到处使用这一个法宝，去解决各种不同的具体问题，而完全轻视了中国革命的具体实践中的一切有价值的经验和已由毛泽东同志从这种经验所概括出来的理论，完全不懂得理论本身也就是实际经验的总结，书本中所学得的一般理论知识只能作为帮助我们总结自己经验的指针。经验主义的分裂，则在于仅仅满足于自己狭小工作范围内的局部经验，而不肯学习各方面的经验，不会集中和坚持有普遍性的经验，不会在一般的理论指导之下来总结这些经验，因此，也就不能领会毛泽东同志从中国革命实际经验中所概括出来的理论。不论教条主义或经验主义，都只能具备片面的革命知识，不能掌握全面的马克思主义知识；而如果不能掌握全面的马克思主义知识，就不可能有真正的马克思主义知识。这种缺少马克思主义知识的人，在主观上往往还是很骄傲地自以为是完美的革命者，但在实际工作中却常常做出许多于敌人有利而于人民有损的错误行为。\n    毛主席说：“我们反对主观主义，必须使上述两种人各向自己缺乏的方面发展，必须使两种人互相结合。有书本知识的人向实际方面发展，然后才可以不停止在书本知识上，才可以不犯教条主义的错误。有工作经验的人要向理论方面学习，要认真读书，然后才可以使经验带上条理性、综合性，上升到理论，然后才可以不把局部的经验误认为即是普遍的真理，才可以不犯经验主义的错误。教条主义，经验主义，两者都是主观主义，是从不同的两极发生的东西。”（整顿学风党风文风）\n    　　　　（二）\n    一九四二年以后的整风运动，收到了很大的成效。在整风的号召之下，许多有书本知识的同志纷纷走到实际中去，或从事实际的研究工作，许多有实际经验的干部也开始努力提高自己的文化程度和理论知识。两种人和两种片面知识，开始由分裂转向结合，许多干部的思想水平因之提高了一步，在党内产生了一批既有丰富的革命经验，又能掌握理论指导的干部和领导者，这就成为今天中国革命战争和各方面革命运动向全国胜利发展的主要因素之一。对于这样的事实，毛主席在去年十二月二十五日的“目前形势和我们的任务”的演讲里作了总结说：“整风运动，是一般地收到了成效，这种成效，主要地是在于使我们的领导机关及许多干部进一步地掌握了马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践之统一这样一个基本的方向。”\n    但是必须注意，毛主席在这里只说整风运动是“一般地收到了成效”，并不是说，经过了整风运动，党的干部思想就已经完全没有问题，或者说主观主义已经完全肃清了。不是的，事实并不是这样的。主观主义的毛病，还必须继续努力，才能完全克服；教条主义的残余在某些干部思想中还起着坏作用；特别是经验主义，还是今天很多实际工作同志的思想方法上所必须克服的主要危险。\n    一九四二年的整风运动，特别强调反对教条主义，因为那时在思想方法上成为党内主要危险的东西，正是教条主义。在两种主观主义之中，教条主义是居于主要的地位。毛主席对当时的情形这样说：“现在我们党内主要的还是教条主义最为危险。因为教条主义最容易装出马恩列斯的面孔，吓唬工农干部，把土包子俘虏起来，充作自己的用人，而工农干部不易识破他们的面孔。也可以吓唬天真烂漫的青年，把他们充当俘虏。”因此，自整风运动以来，对于两种主观主义的斗争，着重点是反对教条主义，在这方面所收的成效也比较大。教条主义的反马克思主义的面孔，在一般干部中被认识得比较清楚，它已失去了当年的威风，不再有吓唬工农干部和俘虏青年的力量了。自然，教条主义就在今天也还有不少的残余，例如，许多干部在执行党的政策时，还不懂得使一般的号召和个别的解决相结合，还不注意去了解当时当地的具体环境和条件，不懂得依照各种不同的具体环境条件而采用不同的步骤来实现这些政策。不少干部还不能脱离命令主义官僚主义的恶劣习惯，把一般的号召和一般的政策生硬地带到各种工作环境里去；他们常常采取强迫命令的方法要群众接受这些号召和政策，而不会逐步引导群众提高觉悟程度来自愿地加以接受。这些就是教条主义表现在目前实际工作中的一种具体形态。但是，从整个说来，教条主义已经不是象当年那样居于主要地位了。\n    经验主义的情形却有些不同。在整风运动中，经验主义也受到批判，但因为当时的重点是反对教条主义，许多同志对于经验主义的反马克思主义的性质还没有认识得很透彻，对于它所产生的危害性还没有足够的估计和重视。这是第一。其次，多年来的游击战争与革命根据地被分割为许多独立单位的分散环境，使很多同志的思想被束缚于狭小的工作范围，使他们习惯于从个别地方的条件和个别地方的经验来考虑和解决问题，而不善于从革命全局的观点上来考虑和解决问题，不善于把地方上的问题联系于党的总的路线和政策。由于以上主观的和客观的两个原因，就使经验主义在目前还成为我们很多干部在工作中的一种重要的错误的思想方法。在着重地反对了教条主义之后，反对经验主义就成为当前反对主观　主义思想方法之主要的方面了。在目前中国革命的发展形势之下，努力克服经验主义，已成为我们迫切的课题。中央宣传部重印“左派幼稚病”第二章的“前言”里，关于目前的革命形势这样说：“由于人民解放军的胜利，我们中国共产党（⑴⑵）已在拥有一万六千万人口并在某种程度上联成一片的地区当政。没有疑问，随着革命的胜利，我们党行将成为统一的全国人民民主政权的领导政党。”这种情势所提给我们党的任务是：“全国的革命形势，要求我们全党全军在一切政治上、军事上、经济上的政策完全统一，而行政制度与行政机构也要求逐渐实行必要的与可能的统一，要适当地缩小各个地方和各个兵团的自治权，要将全国一切可能统一与必须统一的权力统一于中央的领导之下，以便集中力量进行全国规模的解放战争和着手政治、经济与文化的各种新建设。”很明显的，这样的形势和任务，就需要我们各地和各工作部门的干部，在思想上超脱出狭小工作范围的束缚，学习在各种重要问题上联系着目前中国革命的全局趋势来加以考虑和解决，学习把一定范围或一定条件之下的具体的个别问题和党的总路线和政策联系起来。而如果我们各地方和各部门的干部，还保持着经验主义的思想方法，如果他们的思想还只停止在个别的地方条件和局部经验的圈子里，而忘记了党的总的路线和政策，那么，这种思想方法无疑地就要与党在目前形势下的统一领导的要求发生矛盾，就要发生地方主义和无纪律的倾向，就要阻碍正确的路线和政策之实现。\n

中央宣传部的“前言”这样说：“过去由于长期游击战争与革命根据地被分割为许多独立单位的分散环境，在各个单位中，又有各种不同的敌情、地形和政治经济条件的差异，因此我们就不能不高度地发展地方性，不能不高度地发展各个单位的地方自治权，因而也就高度地发展了各个单位的地方积极性与创造性，克服了当时的极为复杂的困难，把中国革命推向了全国规模的胜利。这在当时是完全必要的和正确的方针。但是，正由于这样，也就在我们不少的同志中造成了一种分散主义或地方主义的习惯，造成了党内的某些严重的无纪律状态或无政府状态，这些，则是错误的与有害的。”必须注意一定地方一定部门的特点，这是一方面。但另一方面，有许多同志在工作中常常过分地强调一定地方一定部门的“特殊”；或带着尾巴主义的思想，不加分析地认为“群众要怎么办就怎么办”；并以这些为借口，违反马列主义的原则，拒绝实行上级的指示，拒绝党的总的路线和政策之有步骤的实施。这就破坏了党的领导和纪律，这就对于党的全国统一领导之要求形成了思想的障碍。这就表示，经验主义已成为地方主义或分散主义、无纪律状态或无政府状态之思想基础，而某些地方主义或分散主义、某些无纪律状态或无政府状态之成为习惯，又成了经验主义顽固地存在的条件。因此，在克服地方主义或分散主义、无纪律状态或无政府状态的斗争中，必须同时在思想上与经验主义作斗争。\n    反对经验主义，当然决不是在任何意义上承认或回到教条主义，也决不是否定一切实际革命工作经验的价值。相反地，马克思主义者十分重视一切有益的革命经验，而马克思主义的各方面的理论，正是革命的各方面经验之总结。马克思主义的理论决不是什么神秘的天才脑筋之偶然发现，而是无产阶级及一切人民群众的斗争经验之集中化、条理化。因之，问题并不在于经验本身，而是在于是否会分析经验，总结经验，从经验中找出关于事变的发展和问题的解决的规律知识。而经验主义的毛病，正是在于停止在分散，零碎的经验圈子里，而不会把经验提高到理论，来指导我们的革命斗争。有经验主义毛病的人，常常是眼光短浅，看不到全面，看不清事变发展的过去，现在和将来，因此也就不可能作有理论指导性的、有预见和有通盘计划的工作。\n    经验主义的思想方法与工作方法，在我们不少的干部中是表现得相当普遍的，例如：第一，仅仅满足于狭小工作范围内的局部经验，而不肯虚心学习各方面的新经验。其弊害是不能够在时间、地点、条件变化了的情形之下灵活地改变工作方法，硬把不适合的或旧的经验搬来应用。如把农村中反封建斗争的方法硬搬到城市里去，把长期游击战争时期分散独立工作的经验硬搬到目前解放区已经大块地联成一片的局面里去。第二，眼睛里充满了各种各样分散零碎的经验，跟着不同的经验左右摇摆，而不能保持思想上和工作上的主动性，不能用科学头脑对纷纭繁杂的经验加以分析和总结。如群众运动中的尾巴主义，强调一切要听群众意见，而放弃了无产阶级政党对于群众所必须的领导和教育。又如一九四八年土改和整党工作的指示里指出的一种经验主义的开会方法：“事前毫无准备，不提出问题，不分析问题，不向干部作精心准备好了的内容文字都有斟酌的报告，而听凭到会人无目的杂乱无章的议论，致使会议时间延长，得不到周密的结论。”此外，在我们今天的新闻通讯工作中流行的片面性、孤立性的报导，也是这种经验主义的反映之一；这种报导把一时一地一人一事的个别细节充满了我们的报纸（当然，毫无疑问的，在这些细节报告中，是有许多极有价值的和必须发表的东西），但是不能告诉我们任何广大范围内任何重要问题的全般动向，动态，运动的进度，运动中的矛盾（一方面是成绩和正确的东西，另一方面是困难和错误的东西），产生这些矛盾的症结和解决它们的关键。所有这类方法之所以叫做经验主义的，也正是在于只见树木，不见森林，只见个别，不见一般，任随分散零碎的经验之支配，而不能予以概括，使之上升到理论。这种思想方法上的经验主义，表现在工作方法上就成为事务主义。第三，有些同志采取一种更低级的完全无原则的立场，他们似乎自居为经验的百宝箱，在里面贮藏着各种不同的甚至于互相矛盾的经验，而对于这些经验的正确与错误，并不加以分辨，只看你要什么，就拿出什么来。这种经验主义，常常是教条主义官僚主义的领导之一种补充。教条主义者和官僚主义者有了这种经验主义者的帮忙，就可以高高在上，而为自己的任何主张和任何“指示”找到“经验”的证明。经验主义之所以成为教条主义的俘虏，正是由于它有着这样一种盲目性的缘故。\n    　　（四）\n    反对经验主义，就是要学习总结经验，把分散零碎的感性知识，提高到有综合性、条理性的理论知识。\n    要能总结经验，首先自然要学习各方面的经验，而不要仅只满足于狭小的经验。倾听各种群众的意见，可以帮助我们学到各方面的经验，因此，向群众学习，是很重要的。但是，总结经验，并不等于各种经验的简单积累，而须经过一番分析、研究。分析、研究，又需要有正确的方法指导，因此，必须首先学会总结经验的方法，分析、研究各种现象的方法。即是要学会马克思主义的辩证法唯物论，及其关于社会发展和阶级分析的理论。而经验主义，就是缺少这种马克思主义理论指导下的分析研究。我们的经验，一般来说，不外就是无产阶级政党领导人民大众反帝反封建反官僚资本的斗争经验。人民大众中包含着许多阶级——工人、农民、知识分子、中小资产阶级、开明士绅等等，中国共产党是通过自己的各种纲领政策来团结这些阶级，去反对代表帝国主义及封建势力的地主阶级和官僚资产阶级。我们分析经验，就是要从许多经验中，认清革命斗争中各阶级的面目，他们的各种要求，趋向，以及我们的政策是否能引导他们对革命运动发挥积极的作用。要进行这样的分析研究，没有马克思主义的阶级理论的指导，是不可能的。同一个阶级在斗争中可以有各方面的要求，这些要求对于革命起着不同的甚至相反的作用。例如农民要求平分土地及封建财产，推翻封建地主阶级，这种要求是有革命的进步作用的，是我们应该赞成的。但农民中间，又有一种绝对平均主义的分配思想；这种绝对平均主义，不但要破坏封建的土地和财产关系，而且要用平均主义的方法破坏中农、新式富农的土地和财产关系，并要用平均主义的方法破坏城乡资本主义的工商业。这就是一种农业社会主义的思想，是一种落后的反动的思想，是我们所必须反对的。分析经验，就是要分清这些阶级的不同要求及其不同的作用，以及如何确定适当的政策，以便引导群众发挥他们的进步的革命的要求和作用，防止和纠正他们的错误的要求和作用。没有阶级分析方法作为指导，要作到这样的研究，是不可能的。经验主义者，把尾巴主义代替了有领导的群众路线，认为群众的意见一切都是对的，这种错误的来源之一，就是没有阶级分析的方法。  　要学会总结经验，还要能够分析各种经验所依据的条件。如果经验告诉我们，某一政策在一定的地方和一定的时间实施起来有很大成效，而在另外的地方和另外的时间却没有很大成效甚至发生了许多恶果，那么，就要了解这种不同的结果所以产生的原因，就要分析当地当时的各种主观和客观的条件。经过了这样的分析，我们就可能得出结论，确定某一种政策必须要在什么样的条件之下才能实施。“关于一九四八年土地改革和整党工作的指示”里，确定土地改革必须在三种条件完全具备的地方（环境安定，基本群众大多数已有土地改革要求，干部在数量和质量上确能掌握土改工作）才能实行，而在这些条件不完全具备的地方，即不应列入土改工作范围。这样的决定，就是分析了土改工作各方面经验的结果。\n    自从一九四一年七月党中央发布调查研究决定以来，党的许多组织一般都已认识调查研究总结经验的重要，并且在这方面也已做了许多工作，积累了许多材料。但是许多同志还不懂得怎样去正确地调查研究和总结经验。我们的许多同志，还缺乏分析的方法，因此常常积累了大批材料，还是不能提出问题，解决问题，甚至把原因归之于材料还不够。毛主席曾经用过杀猪的比喻，反问这些同志道：杀猪的人难道是要把世界上的各种猪都杀过，把一切大猪、小猪、公猪、母猪、黑猪、白猪、花猪、中国猪、外国猪都杀过，然后才能总结杀猪的经验吗？不是的，一只通常的猪，就可以代表一切通常的猪。猪的年龄、性别、毛色、国籍，对于杀猪的方法是无意义的。同样，撇开一切无意义的表面现象不论，一个真正典型的事物，也可以代表一般同类的事物。如果对这个典型的事物，加以真正科学的分析，那么就完全可以发现必要的问题，并且提出正确的解决的方法。当然，社会性的事物彼此之间的差异，是要比猪与猪之间的差异复杂些，这里就发生了选择典型的任务，就发生了选择几种典型以代表几种情况的任务，就发生了判断某些事物是否具有普遍性和本质性的任务，而所有这一切，就叫做分析。只见树木，不见森林，是经验主义方法的表现；但是为了见森林，而去数一棵一棵的树木，仍然是经验主义方法的表现，仍然达不到见森林的目的。为了了解森林，需要观察森林的全貌并研究构成这个森林的一种或几种树木。同样，为了了解一种社会性的事物，也需要观察它的全貌并研究它的一种或几种典型。如此，就使得我们有可能提出一般解决问题的指示，而决不需要等候全部经验都收集齐备，要“等候几个月，或半年，甚至更长时间，下面才向上面作总结性的报告，上面才向下面作一般性的指示”，象今天在党的许多组织内流行的办法那样。这种办法，也是一种错误的、必须改正的经验主义的办法。此外，由于缺乏分析的方法，在我们同志总结经验的时候，还常常如同毛主席在“反对党八股”的讲演中所说，“不去思考问题的本质，而满足于甲乙丙丁的现象罗列”，“不提出问题，不分析问题，不解决问题，不表示赞成什么，反对什么，说来说去，还是一个中药铺，没有什么真切的内容”。这样，即使作出了总结性的报告和一般性的指示，对于工作也还是没有帮助，问题还是不能解决。由此可见，虽然作了调查研究总结经验的工夫，但如果不解脱经验主义的束缚，不学会分析的方法，那么我们就仍然不能提高我们的工作，仍然不能及时地掌握动态，解决问题，并交流经验，纠正错误，发扬成绩。也就是说，仍然不能解脱主观主义的错误。\n    　　　　（五）\n    为了反对经验主义，我们的领导干部应当作些什么呢？\n    第一件应当提倡的事情，就是利用各种可能，学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习哲学（辩证唯物论，特别是历史唯物论）和政治经济学。有实际工作经验的同志，必须进一步努力争取时间，研究马克思列宁主义的书籍。在我们许多同志中，目前还很缺乏“认真读书”的热烈空气。整风以来，在某些同志中还产生了一种错误的思想，以为凡读书翻译之类，都是“教条主义”，而否定了一切书本理论知识的价值。这种错误思想，足以阻碍党的理论水平之进步和提高。死钻在书本的牛角尖里，不知道把书本中的一定的知识结合于实际，用以帮助总结实际经验和解决实际问题，这才是教条主义。反对教条主义，并不是反对阅读书本，而是反对把这种书本理论知识与实际经验相分裂。马克思列宁主义的书籍，是无产阶级领导革命运动的国际经验之总结。从这些书籍里面，我们可以学到马克思列宁主义的许多普遍真理，学到关于社会经济发展的理论和阶级分析的理论，学到马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法之具体应用，即学到马克思和列宁怎样去解决各种具体问题。整风运动，是要我们学习马克思列宁主义的普遍真理结合于中国革命的具体实践，也就是要我们学会把这些普遍真理作为指导，来总结中国革命的经验，使之上升为指导中国革命具体实践的正确理论。因此，我们必须依照毛泽东同志在整风运动的报告里所给与的指示。在可能的一定时间来“认真读书”。我们尤其要认真研读毛泽东同志的著作。应该说：毛泽东同志的著作，在一定意义上也是无产阶级领导革命运动的国际经验的一种总结，是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理的一部分。毛泽东同志的著作，是特别总结了中国革命运动的各时期和各方面的经验，因此也就是我们学习把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合之最好的模范。\n    第二，要认真研究党的纲领、路线和政策。经验主义的特征之一，就是不重视这些纲领、路线和政策的研究，因此在实际行动中常常把它们忘记了，或者只记得某些个别的具体的路线和政策，而忘记了总的路线和政策。这样就使得许多同志在执行政策的时候，不断发生左右摇摆。所谓认真研究，自然不是说要一字不漏地死背文件，或是不管具备情况如何，一字不改地死搬文件。应当指出：与教条主义者和经验主义者的方法相反，中央的指示文件总是谨慎地区别着不同的情况而提出不同的工作任务和工作方法，并且反复地教育干部按照具体情况来执行的。中央规定：各地党的组织发现这些文件“如有不适合当地情况的部分，可以和应当提出修改的意见，但必须取得中央同意，方能实行修改。”今天的严重情形，主要地并不在于死背或死搬中央的文件（这无疑是错误的），而在于许多干部根本不认真研究和严格执行中央的文件，反而任意借口情况特殊，擅自修改中央的或上级的政策，执行自以为是的错误的政策，事前既不请示，事后也不报告，这就形成某些严重的无纪律状态或无政府状态。因此，反对忽视中央的指示文件，要求干部对于中央文件实行认真的详细的研究，以便透彻了解中央的路线、政策，深刻领会中央的思想方法，乃是克服经验主义的必要条件。\n    第三，除了以上两个办法以外，为了克服经验主义，还要提倡全党干部在自己的工作中学习正确地调查研究，分析情况，分析经验，随时随地养成具体地分析具体问题的习惯。马克思列宁的著作也好，毛泽东同志的著作也好，中央的指示文件也好，究竟不可能把我们每天工作中所遇到的每个问题都给以具体的解答。相反地，所有这些著作和文件，都是坚决要求我们多多独立地思想，而坚决反对那些一切希图现成的思想上的懒汉的。毛主席说：“有些人虽然有联系群众的长处，但是不善于思索，不愿用脑筋多想苦想，结果仍然做不成事业。列宁经常劝人要善于思索，我们也要这样劝人。”如前所说，现在党内调查研究总结经验的一般习惯是有了，所缺乏的乃是分析的方法；而提倡学习马克思列宁主义的著作，毛泽东同志的著作，和中央的指示文件，其主要目的之一，也就是要学习这个分析的方法。这个学习，一方面需要认真读书，一方面尤其需要实际应用。具体地分析具体问题，这是马克思列宁主义的灵魂，这是正确执行中央路线政策的关键，这是我们全党干部在每天工作中不可以片刻离开的武器。我们学会了使用这个武器，就会使我们既能解脱教条主义，也能解脱经验主义。\n

    "content": "[Hebei Central News]\n\n　　Dawei Village Corrects Deviations in Party Rectification\n    New and Veteran Cadres Unite for Work\n    [Jizhong News] The CPC Shen County Committee, on the 19th of last month, circulated to the entire county the experience and process of the Dawei Village, Tenth District of the county, in rectifying the Party and resolving the relationship between new and veteran cadres, stating in essence: During the Party rectification, due to a lack of investigation and research, Party members were treated indiscriminately, and two cadres, Zheng Yuzeng and Qi Zhengzhong, who had engaged in minor corruption, confessed at mass meetings. Branch Secretary Zhang Laoyue, security officer Zhang Yiwang, and industrial committee member Zhu Ping, who were active and responsible in their work but had a coercive style, were mistakenly labeled as \"stones\" and had their Party membership suspended and were detained for over a month. Forty-six Party members and non-Party cadres were dismissed from their positions; two middle-peasant Party members were wrongly classified as rich peasants and had their Party membership suspended; fifteen poor-peasant Party members were wrongly classified as middle peasants and were not allowed to join the Poor Peasants' League. As a result, Party members and cadres were resentful, some fell ill, and others spoke out on behalf of those who had been confessed and detained. Veteran cadres generally felt demoralized, and a divide arose between new and veteran cadres, creating difficulties in the work. After discovering this situation, the leadership promptly took steps to resolve it.\n    First, they corrected the wrongly determined class statuses. The Poor Peasants' League held a meeting to discuss this. Initially, poor peasant Qi Erbang mentioned that veteran cadre Zhu Ping was a poor man, and that Ren Laocun had been a beggar for two generations and should join the Poor Peasants' League. Many people disagreed. After the district cadre provided guidance, discussion was initiated, and Qi Xiaoniu said, \"We cannot classify his entire family as middle peasants just because someone is critical of him; they are all poor people, and if we do that, everyone will feel embarrassed.\" Gradually, everyone's opinions became unified, and they exclaimed, \"A mistake is a mistake, and what should be done should be done; don't change their class status.\" At the meeting, the class statuses were re-examined, and twenty-four poor peasant households were found among the middle peasants and were absorbed into the Poor Peasants' League, including fifteen veteran cadres.\n    After the new branch was established, it immediately corrected the punishments of the Party members. Huai Yunfang and Gao Dajie, who had been classified as rich peasants from middle peasants, had their class statuses corrected and their Party membership restored. Zhang Laoyue and Zhu Ping, whose Party membership had been suspended pending investigation, had their punishment changed to a warning and dismissal, and Zhang Wanming's punishment was changed to a recommendation for dismissal. After the branch discussed and decided and the district committee approved, a mass meeting was convened. The branch secretary and committee members explained the importance of unity between new and veteran cadres and the reasons for promptly correcting their punishments. The district cadre made a profound self-criticism from the perspective of leadership, highlighted the achievements of the veteran cadres, and also pointed out their shortcomings, such as selfishness, commandism, and detachment from the masses, and explained the harm they caused to the Party and the people, and clarified the future of the Party members. Seeing that their contributions had not been erased and realizing their own shortcomings, the veteran cadres became calm. After these two meetings, the new cadres had a comprehensive understanding of the veteran cadres and saw their work achievements. When Zhang Wanming was transferred to another location, cadres and masses went to see him off. The relationship between new and veteran cadres, Party members, and the masses became closer.\n    The branch meeting to discuss the admission of new Party members, attended by representatives of the new cadres, naturally formed a heart-to-heart meeting between new and veteran cadres or a meeting to review work style. Zhang Laoyue, the former branch secretary who had been detained for more than a month, said, \"Moving my 'stone' was the opinion of a few people with prejudices, not the mass line.\" Veteran cadre Wang Kai and new cadre Qi Bei said in unison, \"Your work style is not very good, but your intentions are not bad, but it is easy to cause dissatisfaction among the masses, and shortcomings in work style should not be there.\" Veteran cadre Qi Rong said, \"Party members who are gold are gold, and those who are soil are soil, must be able to withstand scrutiny... The work style of the new cadres is better than that of the veteran cadres, fair and democratic, and not for their own benefit.\" At this time, the topic turned to the achievements of the Party rectification, and everyone agreed that the Party rectification was correct, otherwise the masses could not be mobilized. As far as the Party members themselves are concerned, if bad habits cannot be changed, they will become incurable if they develop. Veteran village chief Sun Cangxi said, \"I used to be very timid, afraid of making mistakes, and I didn't work hard. Later, I saw that the work style of the new cadres was much stronger than that of the veteran cadres, and we discussed things together, and we understood each other before doing things. We didn't treat the old cadres as outsiders. If there was anything, we would consult with me and have a discussion at the meeting. Even if there was a small gap, it would be opened up. Now I am not so pessimistic and discouraged by the new cadres taking the lead.\" New cadre Liu Lanzhi said, \"I feel that I have little experience and cannot bear the responsibility. If I have something to do, I will discuss it with Yunfang and Dajie, they have experience. New cadres are anxious and cannot find a clue, and veteran cadres should teach them more. Being together all day long, even small opinions will be resolved.\" Everyone spoke their minds, exchanged ideas, and the meeting was very happy. Gao Dajie said, \"If this meeting had been held earlier, people would have been clearer in their minds.\" At the meeting, it was decided that new cadre activists Qi Bei and Liu Lanzhi would join the Party. They both had high prestige among the masses, which made the relationship between the Party and the masses and between new and veteran cadres closer. After the meeting, Zhang Laoyue and Zhu Ping, who had been detained, also took the initiative to work and actively provided opinions on preferential treatment for military families and militia management. Most of the good veteran cadres were restored to their positions through mass elections and with the consent of the masses, and production work was carried out smoothly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大位村纠正整党偏差后　新老干部团结工作\n\n1948-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大位村纠正整党偏差后\n    新老干部团结工作\n    【冀中讯】中共深县县委于上月十九日，将该县十区大位村整党与解决新老干部关系的经过与经验通报全县，大意称：整党时由于缺乏调查研究，对党员“北瓜茄子”（不分好坏）一齐数，两个有点小贪污的干部郑玉增、齐正中在群众会上坦白了。支部书记张老月、治安员张义旺、实业委员朱平工作积极负责，作风上强迫命令，也误当做“石头”停止了党籍，并扣押了一个多月。党员与非党干部四十六人被撤职；两个中农党员错划成富农，停止了党籍；十五个贫农党员错划成中农，没让加入贫农团。因此，党员与干部都发了＠，有的病了，有的替被坦白被扣押的抱不平。老干部一般是情绪低落，新老干部产生了隔膜，造成工作中的困难。领导上发现这种情况后，便抓紧解决。\n    首先改正错订成份。贫农团先开会讨论。起初贫农齐二邦提到老干部朱平是穷人，任老存两辈要饭，应该参加贫农团。许多人不同意。后经区干部进行启发，引起讨论，齐小牛说：“咱不能因为人家挑皮，就把人家大人孩子都划成中农；都是穷人，这么办，大伙脸上都不好看。”大家意见逐渐统一起来，乱嚷道：“错是错，该怎么办怎么办，别给人家变了阶级”。会上重新审查了阶级，从中农里又找出了二十四家贫农，吸收参加了贫农团，其中有十五个是老干部。\n    新支部建立后，即修正了党员的处分。由中农划为富农的怀运芳、高大捷，改正了成份，恢复了党籍。停止党籍听候审查的张老月、朱平改为警告撤职，张万明改为劝告撤职。支部讨论决定、区委批准后即召开群众大会，支书支委们说明了新老干部团结的重要与及时改正他们处分的道理，区干部从领导上作了深刻的检讨，提出了老干部的成绩，也提出了他们的缺点，如自私自利，强迫命令，脱离群众等给予党和人民的危害，并说明了党员的前途。老干部看见自己的功劳没有被抹煞，又认识到了自己的毛病，便心平气和了。在这两个会后，新干部对老干部有了全面的认识，看到了他们的工作成绩。在张万明外调时，干部和群众都去给他送行。新老干部、党员与群众的关系密切起来了。\n    有新干部派代表参加的讨论新党员入党问题的支部会，很自然的形成了新老干部的谈心会或叫作风检讨会。曾被扣过一个多月的前支书张老月说：“搬我的石头，是几个有成见的人的意见，不是群众路线”。老干部王凯和新干部齐辈同声说：“你在作风上不大好，出心不差，可是容易惹的群众不满，作风上的缺点也不该有”。老干部齐荣说：“党员金就是金，土就是土，要经得住事……新干部作风比老干部好，公正民主，又不为己。”这时话题转到整党的成绩，一致认为整党是对的，不然发动不起群众来，就党员本身来讲，如果坏作风改不了，发展下去，就不可救药了。老村长孙藏玺说：“以前我可胆小了，光怕有了错，工作不上劲。后来看见新干部比老干部作风强多了，有事大伙商量，心通意通了再去做，对旧干部不当外人，有什么事找我商量，在会上扯扯思想，就是有点小隔子，可也就开了，现在叫新干部挂拉的我不那么悲观泄劲了”。新干部刘兰芝说：“我自觉着材料小，负不起责任来，有事就和运芳、大捷他们商量商量，他们有经验。新干部着急，摸不着头，老干部就得多教教。一天价在一块，有点小意见也就磨化了”。大家你一言，我一语，都说了自己心里的话，还互相交换了意见，会开的很高兴。高大捷说：“这个会要早开些日子，人们心里更亮快了”。会上通过新干部积极分子齐辈、刘兰芝参加了党，他们在群众中都很有威信，使党与群众、新老干部的关系更加密切了。会后，被扣过的张老月、朱平也主动的做工作，积极的提供优军和民兵管理上的意见。好的老干部大部分在群众选举和群众同意下恢复了工作，生产工作顺利的开展起来。"

It stated:\n\n　　Li Shunda's five-year plan for prosperity and construction, established in 1946, is almost fully completed after two and a half years of labor, and some parts have even exceeded the original plan. Now, the granaries are full of grain, with no shortage of food and clothing; wearing new clothes and living in new houses; covered with new quilts and spread with new felt mats; cattle, mules, and donkeys are thriving in the stalls; sheep are in flocks, and wealth fills the pens; this is the Party's production policy. The Party calls on all Party members and masses in the region to implement this production policy of getting rich, and Comrade Shunda carefully plans, works diligently, and resolutely believes in and implements this policy. Under the leadership and influence of Comrade Shunda, the lives of the masses in the whole village have gradually become prosperous. This is why Comrade Shunda is called a model and why everyone needs to learn from him. Comrade Xiang Tishui correctly understands the Party's policy of Party rectification and adheres to the Party's policy of Party rectification. He always believes: \"Party rectification is because the Party has problems, and there is a gap between the Party and the masses. If the Party is not rectified, it will fail; Party rectification is for the sake of improvement, and for the sake of improving the relationship between the Party and the masses.\" When he encounters opinions that are inconsistent with the facts, he also has troubles, but he does not complain or give up, but seeks correct solutions, and quickly understands: \"Party rectification is the Party cultivating and educating me, and if I have bad work styles and mistakes, I should correct them. Sometimes when we do work, we make mistakes, just like weeding seedlings, if we are not careful, we will damage the seedlings. We should be careful in the future. It is not right to be afraid of damaging the seedlings and not do anything. It is the same with doing work.\" He also always believes: \"The revolution is to make us rich, not to make us poor.\" He has these correct thoughts and understandings, and often explains them to cadres and the masses, which turns into the thoughts and understandings of cadres and the masses. Therefore, he can smoothly carry out Party rectification work, and in the land reform and Party rectification, the whole village adheres to active production and achieves great results. Comrade Li Shunda has the same correct understanding in this regard. Comrades Li Shunda and Xiang Tishui can understand and implement the Party's production policy and Party rectification policy in this way, and as a result, they have made great achievements for the Party, the masses, and themselves. We believe that there are also model Party members like Comrades Li and Xiang in each village. As long as they work hard, they will surely be able to prosper themselves, and at the same time lead the masses to prosper, and transform themselves well, and at the same time lead all Party members and cadres to transform well.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行三地委　表扬李顺达向提水　号召学习他们执行生产、整党政策\n\n1948-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行三地委\n    表扬李顺达向提水\n    号召学习他们执行生产、整党政策\n    【太行讯】中共太行三地委在“七一”发出通报，表扬模范党员李顺达（平顺西沟）、向提水（壶关十里村）二同志的正确思想、模范行动与工作中的优秀成绩。内称：\n    李顺达同志在一九四六年订的五年发家建设计划，经过二年半的劳动，已快全部完成，部分并超过了原来计划。如今粮食满囤，不缺吃穿；穿新衣住新房；盖新被铺新毡；牛骡毛驴，槽头兴旺；羊子成群，活财满圈；这就是党的生产政策。党号召全区党员，群众实行这个发家致富的生产政策，顺达同志即精心计划、勤劳动弹，坚决的相信与执行这个政策。在顺达同志领导与影响下，全村群众的生活都慢慢富裕起来。这就是顺达同志所以称为模范和大家需要向他学习的地方。向提水同志正确了解党的整党政策，坚持党的整党政策。他始终认为：“整党是党有了毛病，党与群众有了隔膜，不整好党要失败；整党是为整好，是为改善党与群众的关系。”他遇到有些与事实不符的意见时，也有苦恼，但他不瞒怨不躺倒，寻求正确的解决办法，很快就想通了：“整党是党培养教育我，自己作风不好有错误，应该改正。咱做工作有时犯了错误，和上地锄苗一样，一不小心就要把苗锄坏，以后小心就对啦，要是怕锄坏不去动弹也不对，做工作也是一样。”他也始终认为：“革命是叫咱富哩，不是革的叫咱穷。”他有这些正确的思想与认识，又经常向干部、群众解释，变成了干部、群众的思想与认识，因此能够顺利的进行整党工作，并在土改、整党中，全村坚持积极生产，成绩很好。李顺达同志在这方面，也是同样的认识正确。李顺达与向提水二同志，能这样了解与执行党的生产政策与整党政策，结果对党对群众对自己都作出了很大的成绩。我们相信各村也有象李、向二同志的模范党员，只要努力，一定都能自己发家，同时领导群众发家，自己改造好，同时领导全体党员干部改造好。"

The heroic Israeli army, acting in self-defense, is in a superior position, and has achieved several major victories in the main battlefield—the center. On the 10th, the Israeli army recaptured the important airport of Lydda (southeast of Tel Aviv) and Wilhelma, which were occupied by the Arab army in the early stages of the war. On the 12th, the Israeli army also occupied Ramle, a key location southwest of Lydda Sea, and its northeastern twin cities, thereby opening a road to the southeast towards Latrun. (Note: Latrun is the center of the Arab blockade of the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway.)

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS reports: The Presidium of the German People's Committee sent a letter on the 8th to the Allied Control Council and the commanders of the occupying forces in Germany, requesting the enactment of laws clearly stipulating the German unification demanded by the national movement, or the promulgation of instructions to hold a national referendum on this issue. The letter points out that among the names in the national signature campaign to strive for German unification, fifteen million are German citizens with the right to vote, accounting for 37% of all German voters, which has reached the statutory quota (Note: The German Weimar Constitution stipulates that if 10% of the voters request a national referendum on certain bills, it must be held). The German People's Committee also requested that the national referendum be held on a Sunday in September this year. Representatives of the German Socialist Unity Party reported to the German People's Congress at the beginning of the month on the results of the nationwide popular referendum, stating that approximately 25 million Germans voted in favor of unification, which is strong evidence in favor of maintaining German national unity.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS reports: U.S. imperialism and its British and French partners are intensifying the creation of a West German puppet state. The international observer of the Soviet newspaper Pravda wrote on the 5th: \"Important negotiations have been held in Frankfurt (Note: located in the northwestern part of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, the headquarters of the U.S. occupying forces). The military governors of the western occupation zones held a secret meeting on June 30. The next day, they held a meeting with the prime ministers of the West German states. The U.S. representatives played the leading role in these talks. The issues discussed included: revising the borders of the West German states, establishing a 'Ruhr State,' establishing the so-called 'Rhine Federal State,' abolishing the Hesse State Constitution (which contains clauses on industrial socialization) and the rights of the industrial committee, which have long been dissatisfied with the U.S. occupying authorities. The American 'protectors,' with the help of their British and French partners, are repeatedly cutting Germany according to their own tastes.\" According to information obtained by the Pravda reporter in Berlin: At the secret meeting in Frankfurt, Clay announced that Saar was \"no longer German territory\"; Robertson added that the state borders would be revised \"in accordance with tradition.\" In order to reward Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg for their obedience to the United States, the London Conference decided to cede the Selfkant, Borkum Island, the mouth of the Ems River, and the Venlo area from West Germany to the Netherlands, and Belgium and Luxembourg also received several pieces of land. After the Frankfurt meeting, the prime ministers of the eleven West German states were ordered to discuss in Koblenz the plan submitted by the U.S., British, and French authorities to establish a \"West German state.\"\n　　The conspiracy to create a West German puppet state has been strongly opposed by the West German people. The Central Committee of the Socialist People's Party of Germany (West German Communist Party) issued a statement saying: Germany does not need a \"West German state,\" does not need a forced federal system, and does not need occupation laws, but only desires a unified Germany, self-determination, a just peace treaty, and an end to the occupation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 德国人民委员会　要求公决德国统一　西德人民反对美帝制造傀儡\n\n1948-07-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　德国人民委员会\n    要求公决德国统一\n    西德人民反对美帝制造傀儡\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社报导：德国人民委员会主席团于八日致函盟国管制委员会和德境占领军司令，请求颁布法律，明确规定全国运动所要求的德国统一，或颁布训令，举行关于这一问题的全民公决。该函指出：在争取德国统一的全国签名运动的名单中，有一千五百万人是有选举权的德国公民，即占全德选民的百分之三十七，这已到达法定的名额（按：德国威玛宪法规定：如百分之十的选民要求对某些法案举行全民公决，则必须举行之）。德国人民委员会并要求在今年九月择一星期日举行全民公决。德国统一社会党代表于月初向德国人民会议报告全德范围人民复决投票的结果称：投票赞成统一的德国人约二千五百万，这是赞成保持德国全国统一的有力证明。\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社报导：美帝国主义及其英法伙伴，正在加紧制造西德傀儡国家。苏联真理报国际观察家于五日著文称：“重要谈判已在法兰克福（按在德国美占区西北部，美占领军总部所在地）举行。西部占领区军事总督于六月三十日曾举行秘密会议。次日，他们与西德各州总理进行会议。美代表在这些会谈中担任主角。讨论的问题有：修改西德各州边界，设立‘鲁尔州’，建立所谓‘莱茵联邦州’，取消黑森州宪法（这一宪法载有工业社会化的条款）和很久以来就为美占领当局所不满的工业委员会的权利。美国‘保护人’在英法伙伴帮助之下，一再按照他们自己的胃口来切割德国”。又据真理报驻柏林记者获息：在这次法兰克福的秘密会议上，克莱宣布萨尔已“再不是德国的领土”；罗伯逊补充说：州的边界将“依照传统”加以修改。为了酬偿比、荷、卢对美国的顺从，伦敦会议曾决定把德荷交界处的磐史因、伯肯姆岛、埃姆斯河口和文洛城地区自西德割给荷兰，比利时和卢森堡也都得到几块土地。法兰克福会议之后，西德十一州总理奉命在科不林士商讨美英法当局提交的建立“西德国家”的方案。\n    制造西德傀儡国家的阴谋，已遭到西德人民的强烈反对。德国社会主义人民党（西德共产党）中央特为此发表声明说：德国不需要“西德国家”，不需要强迫的联邦制，也不需要占领法规，只愿望统一的德国，自决权，公正的和约和结束占领。"

On June 23rd, the US, British, and French authorities in Germany implemented the West German \"Kreditmark\" in West Berlin, prohibiting people from exchanging currency or trading with the Soviet zone. This severed the connection between the West Berlin occupation zone and other areas using the Soviet zone Mark, not only plunging the 2.5 million residents of West Berlin into severe shortages of food, coal, and electricity, but also backfiring on the US, British, and French occupation forces, causing difficulties in supplying food and coal. According to a US official spokesperson, West Berlin's food reserves can only sustain rations until September 1st, and coal supplies can only last for 28 days. As for electricity, usage was reduced by a quarter two weeks ago, and now it can only be supplied for four hours a day. Under these circumstances, more than a hundred enterprises in West Berlin have been unable to operate for a full week, with many only working 24 hours per week; the number of unemployed workers has now exceeded 100,000. To oppose the use of the disastrous \"Kreditmark,\" delegations from major factories in Berlin went to the city hall to petition, demanding the use of the same currency as the Soviet zone in West Berlin. The chairman of the Berlin City Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, Ma Tun, also called for unifying the currencies of Berlin and the Soviet zone. Due to the pressure of the situation, some leaders of the Berlin city government, who are colluding with the US, British, and French, have had to change their attitude. Therefore, on the 7th, the city government unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Mark circulating in the Soviet zone be used as the legal currency generally used in the greater Berlin area.\n　　Under these unfavorable circumstances, the commanders-in-chief of the US, British, and French occupation forces visited Marshal Sokolovsky, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces, on the 3rd, seeking to open up land transportation between Berlin and the western occupation zones. Marshal Sokolovsky replied that the railway lines from Berlin to West Germany were still under repair. Marshal Sokolovsky emphatically stated that in view of the western occupying authorities' implementation of separate currency reforms and other measures aimed at undermining the economy of the Soviet zone, the Soviet military authorities consider it their sacred duty to protect the 20 million German residents of the Soviet zone and the economy of the Soviet zone.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 德境苏占区经济巩固　美英法破坏计划碰壁  柏林西部粮煤困难企业生产受阻大工厂请愿要求使用苏占区货币\n\n1948-07-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　德境苏占区经济巩固\n    美英法破坏计划碰壁\n    柏林西部粮煤困难企业生产受阻大工厂请愿要求使用苏占区货币\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：美英法反动派破坏柏林经济体系的行动正步步碰壁。六月二十三日，德境美英法当局在柏林西部实施西德实行的“克莱马克”，禁止人民向苏占区兑换货币或进行贸易。这样，便使柏林西部占区与使用苏占区马克的其他地方的联系断绝，不仅柏林西部二百五十万居民陷入粮食与煤电奇缺的苦境中，甚至美英法占领军亦作茧自缚，致粮煤供应发生困难。据美国官方发言人称：柏林西部占区存粮仅可维持配给至九月一日，煤的供应则仅能维待二十八天。至于电力使用，在两周前已减少四分之一，现则每日仅能供应四小时。在这种情形下，柏林西部占区已有一百多个企业不能整周开工，其中许多企业每周只能工作二十四小时；失业工人现已超过十万人。为反对使用带来灾难的“克莱马克”，柏林各大工厂代表团曾赴市政府请愿，要求在柏林西部占区使用与苏占区同一的货币。统一社会党柏林市委会主席马吞，也呼吁统一柏林与苏占区的货币。由于情势所迫，与美英法勾结的柏林市政府的某些首领们，也不得不改变态度。因此，市政府于七日一致通过决议，要求以苏占区流通的马克作为大柏林市区通用的合法货币。\n    在这种不利形势下，美英法占领军总司令乃于三日同往谒见苏军总司令索柯洛夫斯基元帅，企求打开柏林与西部占领区之间的陆上交通。索帅答称：从柏林通往西德的铁路线尚在修理中。索帅着重声明：在西部占领当局实行单独货币改革并采取其他旨在破坏苏占区经济措施的情况下，苏军当局认为保护苏占区二千万德国居民以及苏占区经济，乃是苏军当局的神圣职责。"

Some sheep and pigs were killed or injured, some houses were damaged with holes, and many trees were knocked down or uprooted. The county government has sent special personnel to the disaster areas to inspect and express condolences, distribute relief grain, and loan out seeds for replanting, vigorously mobilizing and organizing the masses to support the seedlings and replant late millet and small corn to make up for the losses.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(North Yue Fourth Branch)\n    [South Hebei News] Fifty-one villages in Julu suffered a hailstorm on the afternoon of June 30th. In the most severely affected villages, such as Nanhakou, Qiaojiazhuang, Da Xia Ma Fang, and Dong Xi Tongmazhen, cotton, sesame, sorghum, and beans were mostly beaten into bare stalks or mud. The affected area was about 40 li long and ranged from 7 or 8 li to 12 or 13 li wide, totaling about 280 square li (each square li is 5 qing 40 mu), equivalent to 1,512 qing of land. After the hailstorm, the county's democratic government immediately sent people to the affected villages to investigate the disaster, comfort the masses, and plan for tax reductions, exemptions, and relief based on the specific disaster situation. At present, they are mobilizing and organizing the masses to actively replant late seedlings.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 行唐钜鹿遭雹灾群众正补种晚苗\n\n1948-07-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　行唐钜鹿遭雹灾群众正补种晚苗\n    【北岳讯】行唐于上月三十日下午突降冰雹，五个区约八十村受害颇重。雹块大者如人头、饭碗，小者如核桃、枣儿。降雹时间最长的地方约达一点多钟。一区被灾最重，庙沟等二十村的禾苗，被打的全无复活希望。有些羊猪被砸死砸伤，有些房子被砸成洞，树木被砸倒、刮倒的也不少。该县政府已派专人往灾区验看、慰问，发放救济粮，贷出补种种子，大力发动与组织群众扶苗，重种晚谷、小棒子等，以补救这一损失。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（北岳四支社）\n    【冀南讯】钜鹿五十一个村庄，于六月三十日下午遭受雹灾，灾情最严重的南哈口、乔家庄、大小马坊、东西铜马镇等十余村，棉花、芝麻、高粱、豆子多被砸成光杆或砸成烂泥。受灾面积长约四十里，宽约七、八里到十二、三里不等，约合二百八十平方里（每平方里为五顷四十亩），共折地一千五百一十二顷。雹灾发生后，该县民主政府立即派人到受灾村调查灾情，安慰群众，并根据具体灾情，计划减征、免征和救济，目下正动员组织群众，积极补种晚苗。"

Most of the old women, women, and children are also going to the fields to carry water to plant sweet potatoes. The village head, Zhang Fanjiang's, mother is eighty-three years old but is still vying to go to the fields, not willing to be idle for a moment. In four days, the whole village carried water to plant thirty-seven and a half mu of sweet potatoes. Based on the Administrative Office's urgent call for planting and fighting drought, the comrades stationed in the village convened a mass meeting on the evening of the 7th of this month, mobilizing everyone to carry water to plant corn. After everyone discussed it, Zeng Zhong said: \"My sweet potatoes are all planted, I will plant corn first thing tomorrow. If it doesn't rain, we still have to eat, relying on heaven is not as good as relying on ourselves.\" After a long discussion, most people agreed to speed up planting and started to take action the next day. The Liuzhuang work team convened a meeting of party members of the branch in groups on the 8th of this month to discuss ways to fight drought, water, and plant. They discussed several specific suggestions: (1) Plant more sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes are drought-resistant and have a high yield. One load of water can water ten sweet potato plants, and they don't need to be watered again for half a month. (2) Sow radishes, which have a high yield and ensure a harvest. (3) Plant corn. Rake the land, dig a pit, pour some water in it, and plant it. When the seedlings come out, dig a ditch and water it again, and it won't matter if it doesn't rain for twenty days. Everyone agreed with these methods and said: Go back and mobilize the neighbors to water and plant, start immediately, and we can't rely on heaven for food.\n    [Ji'nan News] The masses in many villages in Yuanchao, Qiu County, and Linzhang are fighting drought and preventing disasters by carrying water to plant seedlings. At a meeting of village cadres in the Shalu sub-district of the Fourth District of Yuanchao, the methods of fighting drought and preparing for famine were specifically discussed. Qian Shalu Village is preparing to mobilize the masses to dig a large number of earth wells; Cao Kun Village is preparing to repair the broken wells and use the pit water to water melons, seedlings, and plant sweet potatoes. After the meeting, Bei Wangfeng Village immediately took action, carrying water to plant eighteen and a half mu of corn in two days. Wang Guo'an, the production director of Menggu in the Third District of Qiu County, said at the production committee meeting: \"Dog days are coming soon, and now is the time to plant sweet potatoes. It may be too late to wait for the rain.\" At the meeting of production team leaders, he called on the masses to carry water to plant, and the whole village has already started. The men in Wang Yuewang's family carry water, three children water the ground, and two women plant seedlings, planting two mu in one morning. The whole village carried two thousand two hundred loads of water in three days, planting a total of forty-six mu of sweet potatoes. Wang Yuecong, the village head of Gutian Village in Linzhang, immediately held a meeting of cadres above the team leader level after returning to the village from the sub-district meeting to study the \"organizational leadership for drought resistance and famine preparedness.\" Under the leadership of all village cadres and team leaders, nine waterwheels were erected and repaired within five or six days, which can water twenty-seven mu of land every day. Many women also participated in weeding. Li Xiaogen's mother is over forty years old and hoes more than one mu of land a day; Zhao Xiaoqing also led his wife to hoe the ground. The whole village has now weeded three times, and the wheat stubble has also been hoeed twice.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不等雨不靠天　南峰元朝等县点种浇苗\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　不等雨不靠天\n    南峰元朝等县点种浇苗\n    【冀鲁豫讯】南峰二区孔庄等村群众打破等雨思想，男女老幼下手灌水栽苗。多数老婆婆、妇女、小孩也都下地担水抬水栽种红薯。村长张繁江的母亲八十三岁了，还争着上地，一会不肯闲着。四天工夫，全村担水栽红薯三十七亩半。驻村工作同志根据行署点种抗旱的紧急号召，又于本月七日晚间，召开群众大会，动员大家担水种棒子，大家酝酿起来，曾仲说：“我的红薯栽完啦，明天一早就点种玉蜀黍去，天不下雨也不能不吃饭，靠天吃饭不如靠自己。”讨论了很长时间，多数人都同意加紧点种，第二天就行动起来。刘庄工作组于本月八日召集支部党员分组开会，商量抗旱浇地点种办法，讨论出几个具体意见：（一）多栽红薯。红薯耐旱，收成又多。种红薯一挑水能浇十棵，可以半月不再浇。（二）撒萝卜，收的多，还保险收。（三）点棒子。耙好地，挖个坑，浇点水点下去，出了苗再挖个沟浇一下，二十天不下雨也不碍事。大家同意这些办法，都说：回去动员邻居都浇地栽种，马上干，不能靠天吃饭。\n    【冀南讯】元朝、邱县、临漳不少村庄群众抗旱防灾，担水点苗。元朝四区沙路小区村干联席会上，专门讨论抗旱备荒办法。前沙路村准备发动群众大量挖土井；曹坤村准备把坏井修理好，并利用坑水浇瓜、浇苗、点种红薯。北王奉村会后立即行动，两天内担水点种玉茭十八亩半。邱县三区孟固生产主任王国安，在召开生产委员会时说：“伏天快到，现在正是栽红薯的时候，等着天下雨再栽恐怕晚了。”在开生产小组长会时，又号召群众担水栽种，现全村已经开始。王月望家男的担水，三个小孩浇地，两个妇女插种，一晌栽了二亩。全村在三天内担了二千二百担水，共栽红薯四十六亩。临漳谷天村村长王月从，在小区开会回村后，立即开组长以上干部会，研究“抗早备荒的组织领导。”在全村干部组长领导下，五六天内按起和修理好水车九辆，每天能浇田二十七亩。锄苗中很多妇女也参加了，李小根娘四十多岁，一天锄地一亩多；赵小庆也领着他媳妇去锄地。现全村锄苗已过三遍，麦茬也锄了两遍。"

After receiving the wheat protection mission, the unit, under the slogan of \"strike first,\" combined with fraternal units on May 27 to attack the Zhu Village stronghold north of Bo'ai County for the first time. On May 29, it also defeated over a thousand Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were looting grain in Nie Village, Wuzhi County, disrupting the enemy's grain-looting deployment. Later, it repelled the grain-looting enemy twice in Xiaoshang and Shaqiupu, forcing the enemy back to its stronghold, preventing them from coming out, and enabling the masses of Bo'ai to successfully complete the wheat harvest. Recently, the unit summarized its achievements from May 27 to June 26, capturing six regular enemy soldiers, wounding seventy bandits, killing thirty-two bandits below the rank of staff officer and company commander, and seizing one radio.

At the same time, they launched a political offensive, writing slogans everywhere, distributing leaflets, holding mass meetings and small-scale forums for the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas, disintegrating thirty-one returned enemy puppet soldiers, and enabling fleeing households to return to their villages one after another. An old man selling coal in Lifeng said: \"The Eighth Route Army's slogans and leaflets were posted at the gate of the Lifeng puppet county government, and the stubborn army dared not call out or in for three days.\" The masses were extremely excited, and the landlords in the Chiang-controlled areas also said: \"When the Eighth Route Army was here, we only had to pay grain once a year, and there was always a way; when the stubborn army comes, there is no limit to what they want.

    "content": "[Chahar News] The Party, government, army, and people of Wei County have launched a vigorous assault, eliminating more than 11,000 mu of wasteland. Wei County is a relatively wealthy county in southern Chahar. After more than a year of cruel rule by the bandit Fu, over 16,541 mu of land in the county was deserted (figures for one district missing). One-third of the families in the county had nothing to eat, and there was a severe shortage of manpower, animal power, and seeds. After our army advanced into southern Chahar, it immediately cooperated with the government to reclaim the wasteland. The government issued agricultural loans of 280 million yuan (border currency), and the army also contributed manpower and animal power to help with planting, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for production. A certain artillery company of a certain unit helped the people cultivate 90 mu of land in three days; a certain logistics department had 144 animals help the villagers deliver 500 loads of manure and cultivate more than 200 mu of land in four days; convalescents Wang Zhong, Feng Tianxi, and others helped the masses weed 17 mu of seedlings despite their illness, and the civilian laborers accompanying the army also seized the opportunity to help the villagers stationed in the villages with production. At present, more than 11,281 mu of wasteland has been eliminated in the county, and the small seedlings have been hoed once. Recently, the government has again urgently called for the complete elimination of wasteland, and the masses in various places are continuing their assault.\n\n[Jizhong 10th Dispatch] Jianguo and other counties continue to launch an assault to eliminate wasteland and sow seeds. Jianguo County has found 1,228 mu of wasteland in 96 villages; some of this wasteland is land confiscated or requisitioned from landlords and rich peasants that has not been fully distributed; some is land left behind by fleeing households; some is land that peasants have abandoned due to a lack of livestock and inability to cultivate; and some is honorary soldiers’ land left in the villages with no one to cultivate it. On June 23, the county had rainfall, and the leadership immediately called for seizing the time to eliminate wasteland. However, the masses had many concerns in their minds. Some were afraid that if they planted wasteland now, they would have to pay more public grain during the autumn harvest; some village cadres were afraid that if they planted more land, others would say they were taking too much fruit and were unwilling to take the lead in planting more; and some were afraid of “struggle” if they had more land. The leadership conducted extensive publicity through various meetings, repeatedly explaining that land reform was for the purpose of developing production and getting rich; villages where land reform had been thoroughly carried out would no longer implement land reform; future burdens would be paid according to the normal annual output, and those who increased yields through intensive farming and good management would never have their burdens increased. They also used accounting methods to explain that planting wasteland was not only not a loss but also of great benefit to themselves. After publicity and explanation, the masses' concerns were gradually eliminated. In five days, 5,135 mu of wasteland were eliminated, and another 1,093 mu were being continued to be eliminated. In 98 villages in Hejian County, 2,882 mu of wasteland were found. The main reasons for the wasteland were that there was a lot of saline-alkali land, the peasants were unwilling to plant it, and they were afraid of heavy burdens. In order to eliminate the wasteland, the county's Tuotuo Society went to various districts in groups to cooperate with local cadres and lead the masses to eliminate the wasteland as they investigated. By the end of June, more than 1,900 mu had been eliminated in the county.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 党政军民奋力突击　蔚县消灭荒地万亩  建国宣传负担政策动员群众灭荒\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　党政军民奋力突击\n    蔚县消灭荒地万亩\n    建国宣传负担政策动员群众灭荒\n    【察哈尔讯】蔚县党政军民奋力突击，消灭荒地一万一千多亩。该县是察南较富县份，经傅匪一年多残酷统治，全县荒芜土地一万六千五百四十一亩（缺一个区数字），全县有三分之一的人家没吃的，人力畜力及种子都很缺乏。我军挺进察南后，当即协同政府抢救荒地，政府发放农贷二亿八千万元（边币），军队也抽出人畜力帮助抢种，群众生产情绪大大提高。×部炮兵连三天助民耕地九十亩；×后勤部四天中有一百四十四头牲口帮老乡送粪五百担，耕地二百多亩；休养员王仲、冯天喜等带病帮群众拔苗十七亩，随军民工也抓紧空隙帮助驻村群众生产。现全县已消灭荒地一万一千二百八十一亩，小苗已锄过头遍。最近政府又紧急号召彻底消灭荒地，各地群众正继续突击中。\n    【冀中十日电】建国等县继续突击灭荒播种。建国九十六个村查出荒地一千二百二十八亩；这些荒地一部分是没收与征收地富的土地，没完全分配下去；一部分是逃亡户留下的地；一部分是农民因缺乏牲口、无法耕种荒了的；还有一部分是村中所留无人耕种的荣军田。六月二十三日该县降雨，领导上立即号召抓紧时间消灭荒地。但群众思想上存在很多顾虑，有的怕现在种了荒地，秋征时出公粮多；有的村干部怕多种了地，别人说多占果实，不愿带头多种；还有些人怕地多了“斗争”。领导上通过各种会议，进行了广泛宣传，反复说明土改就是为了发展生产，发家致富；土改已经彻底的村，就不再实行土改了；今后负担按照常年应产量交纳，凡因精耕细作，善于经营而增加收成者绝不增加负担。并用算帐方法，说明种荒地不仅不吃亏，对自己好处很大。经过宣传解释，逐渐消除了群众的顾虑。在五天中，即消灭荒地五千一百三十五亩，还有一千零九十三亩正继续消灭中。河间九十八个村中，查出二千八百八十二亩荒地，荒了的主要原因是硷薄地多，农民不愿种，又怕负担重。该县推拖社为消灭荒地，便分头到各区配合当地干部，领导群众随查随消灭。到六月底，全县消灭一千九百多亩。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-18",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Jizhong News] The Jizhong Eighth Sub-district issued a large number of loans to support mass agricultural and sideline production. As of the end of May, a total of 4,066,600,000 yuan (border currency, same below) had been loaned, driving 813,300,000 yuan in private capital. Among them, agricultural loans amounted to 2,190,000,000 yuan, sideline loans amounted to 1,089,000,000 yuan, and water conservancy loans amounted to 884,000,000 yuan. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Jinghai, Qingcangjiao, Wenxin, Dacheng, Renhe, Jiaohe, and Qingxian: the masses used loans combined with private capital to purchase 289 head of livestock. In Qingcangjiao, 55 poor peasant households and 2 middle peasant households in ten villages used 34,400,000 yuan in loans, driving 4,500,000 yuan in private capital, and bought 22 head of livestock, solving the difficulties of spring plowing and sowing for them and others. Wenxin purchased livestock through loans to rush plant waterlogged land, and the urban area rushed to plant 6,061 mu in eight days. Wenxin and Jinghai counties are close to the Wen'an Depression and often suffer from floods, making them relatively poor. The government issued more than 420 million yuan in loans to support the masses in building 29,644 rice ponds, which can grow 73,000 mu of rice, enabling 4,456 poor peasant households and 678 middle peasant households to plant an average of 7 mu of rice per household. Loans supported the rush planting of spring wheat in 31 villages, lending to 5,130 households, enabling each household to plant an average of 24 mu of spring wheat. The masses in the Eighth Sub-district were not accustomed to building wells. After repeated publicity, explanation, and key demonstrations, the masses' concerns were gradually broken. According to statistics from eight counties including Hejian, Xianjiao, Renqiu, and Renhe: 102 wells have been completed, and 106 are under construction or will be started. Seventy-seven villages in Qingxian alone dug 1,154 earthen wells. In order to solve the difficulty of using bricks for well construction, loans supported the establishment of 16 brick kilns, laying a solid foundation for the development of water conservancy in the Eighth Sub-district. Many villages in Jinghai suffered from enemy and water disasters, and the masses' lives were very difficult. Loans of 36,475,000 yuan, driving 4,500,000 yuan in private capital, organized the masses to restore mat weaving. Each person can weave two or three mats a day, and each mat can earn several thousand yuan. The lives of most poor peasants in about twenty villages have been resolved, improving everyone's production enthusiasm. Ren Pang Linhe Village was very poor. Using a loan of 13 million yuan, it organized 108 households to spin and weave. When the accounts were settled after a month, the entire village earned a total of 29,760,000 yuan from weaving, and the production efficiency exceeded the previous three-fifths. The above figures show that the loan work in the Eighth Sub-district has made great achievements, but on the other hand, there are still the following main shortcomings: In some places, loans rely solely on village cadres and poor peasant associations. They are granted loans based on their introduction letters without in-depth investigation and mobilizing the masses. Tai Yancheng and Song Tiande, representatives of Qianchang in the Sixth District before the founding of the country, borrowed 10,030,000 yuan themselves, and no one else knew about it. At the same time, there is a lack of a clear production perspective. In the issuance of loans in various counties, there is still a phenomenon of only issuing loans without organizing production, and there is also a lack of production education for the masses. Some people do not engage in production after receiving loans and waste them. Some places simply follow the \"poor and hired peasant line\", and in the issuance, regardless of whether there are production conditions, they lend to poor and hired peasants, ignoring helping middle peasants in production. In terms of leadership, some places lack in-depth inspection and research, and problems cannot be corrected in time, and experiences and lessons cannot be summarized and promoted in time.\n    In the future, when issuing loans, we must establish a long-term construction thinking, and everything must start from restoring and developing production. We must vigorously develop water conservancy and issue water conservancy loans in a planned and focused manner. In terms of methods, we should mobilize the masses, self-report and publicly discuss, and organize the masses through loans. In terms of loan recipients, loans should be given to hardworking farmers and other people in need according to production needs, but the difficulties of poor and hired peasants should be taken care of first. Strengthen inspection work, start from organizing production, widely carry out production education, adopt democratic methods, exchange experiences, establish models, educate the backward, and further improve production work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中八分区　发放贷款四十亿　扶助群众农副业生产\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中八分区\n    发放贷款四十亿\n    扶助群众农副业生产\n    【冀中讯】冀中八分区发放大批贷款，扶助群众农副业生产，截至五月底，共贷出四十万万六千六百余万元（边币，下同），并带动私资八万万一千三百余万元。其中农业贷款二十一万万九千余万元，副业贷款十万万八千九百余万元，水利贷款八万万八千四百余万元。根据静海、青沧交、文新、大城、任河、交河、青县等七个县的不完整统计：群众利用贷款结合私资，已经买到牲口二百八十九头。青沧交十个村五十五户贫农，两户中农，用贷款三千四百四十万元，带动私资四百五十万元，买牲口二十二头，解决了他们及另外一些人春耕播种的困难。文新通过贷款购买牲口，抢种水脱地，城厢区八天中抢种六千零六十一亩。文新、静海两县靠近文安洼，常年受水灾，比较贫苦，政府发放贷款四万万二千多万元，扶植群众打稻池子二万九千六百四十四个，能种稻子七万三千亩，使四千四百五十六户贫农，六百七十八户中农，平均每户能种上七亩稻子。贷款扶植了三十一个村的春麦抢种，贷给五千一百三十户，使每户平均能种上二十四亩春麦。八分区群众不习惯造井，经过反复宣传解释和重点示范，逐渐打破了群众的顾虑。据河间、献交、任邱、任河等八个县的统计：已打成水井一百零二眼，已动工和将动工的有一百零六眼。青县七十七个村就打了一千一百五十四眼土井。为了解决扶井用砖的困难，贷款百植了十六座砖窑，对八分区开展水利，打下了有力的基础。静海有不少村庄遭受敌灾水灾，群众生活非常困难。贷款三千六百四十七万五千元，带动私资四百五十万元，组织群众恢复席业，每天一人能织两三领席，一领席能赚几千元。二十来个村庄大部分贫农的生活得到了解决，提高了大家的生产情绪。任庞临河村很穷，用贷款一千三百万元，组织了一百零八户纺织，一个月结帐时，全村织布共赚二千九百七十六万元，生产效率超过以往五分之三。以上数字说明八分区的贷款工作有很大成绩，但在另一方面，还存在着以下几个主要缺点：有些地方贷款时光依靠村干部和贫农团，看到他们的介绍信就贷给，不去深入调查和发动群众，建国六区前厂代表台彦成、宋天德等自己贷款一千零三十万元，别人都不知道。同时缺乏明确的生产观点，在各县发放贷款中还存在着只管发放，不管组织生产的现象，对群众也缺乏生产教育。有些人贷到款不去生产，浪费掉了。有些地方单纯的走“贫雇农路线”，在发放时不管是不是有生产条件，只要是贫雇农就贷，忽视了帮助中农生产。在领导上有些地方缺乏深入的检查研究，有了毛病不能及时纠正，经验教训不能及时总结推广。\n    今后发放贷款，必须树立长期的建设思想，一切从恢复和发展生产出发。必须大力开展水利，有计划有重点的发放水利贷款。在方式上应该发动群众，自报公议，通过贷款把群众组织起来。在贷款对象上，应按照生产需要，贷给劳苦农民及其他需要的人民，但首先应照顾贫雇农的困难。加强检查工作，从组织生产着手，广泛进行生产教育，采取民主方式，交流经验，树立模范，教育落后，把生产工作再提高一步。"

The local armed forces of the entire sub-district have fought 579 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 6,880 officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet forces, including the puppet regiment commander Zhai Zongzhou (killed), deputy regiment commander Niu Buyun (captured), and the puppet county magistrate of Wen'an, Gao Zezhou (killed); seizing 7 artillery pieces, 93 light and heavy machine guns, 2,020 rifles and carbines, 20 grenade launchers, and 136,650 rounds of ammunition. From January to June this year, the militia of the entire sub-district fought 488 battles in half a year, killing, wounding, and capturing 724 enemies. The morale of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in various parts of the Daqing River North is declining daily under the continuous attacks of our army, and the number of deserters and surrenders is increasing day by day. According to statistics for June alone, the \"Chiang Army Retiree Reception Center\" in the Tenth Military Sub-district received more than 1,700 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet officers and soldiers who had deserted or surrendered, an increase of one-third compared to May, and more than double the total number received in January, February, March, and April (more than 700).\n　　【Another Dispatch】 A certain unit of the local armed forces of the Tenth Military Sub-district bravely advanced into the Daxing area, north of the Yongding River, and actively attacked the enemy behind enemy lines. On June 23, they drove away the puppet troops stationed in Xiaocixiang, seizing two rifles. On June 24, they attacked the troops of the local Chiang Kai-shek bandit Liu Cuiran, who were dispatched to seize wheat in Beiwangli Village, killing ten enemies, wounding one enemy, and seizing two rifles. On June 25, they attacked the Chiang bandit stronghold in Nangezhuang, and the defending enemy fled in panic, and the stronghold was completely destroyed by us.\n　　【Jizhong Electric】 The cadres and militia of our Qingyuan County repelled an invasion by Chiang bandits thirty times their number, killing and wounding forty-two bandits, demonstrating a high degree of tenacity and bravery. On the 4th of this month, two regiments of the 32nd Provisional Division and two battalions of the 33rd Provisional Division of the Chiang bandits in Baoding, combined with more than 3,000 local Chiang bandits, with more than 200 carts, invaded Dabaotuan Village, Lang Village, and Biyangcheng area in the Fourth District of Qingyuan County in three routes to plunder grain. Our local cadres and militia rose up to resist and launched fierce village battles with the enemy. The enemy concentrated its forces and launched three assaults on our positions under the cover of machine guns and artillery, but were all repelled. Liu Zhi, the captain of a certain district, killed or wounded seven enemies alone. Zhi, the head of a certain district, led the militia in bravely resisting, killing or wounding more than twenty enemies. The local people braved the enemy's fierce artillery fire to actively support the combat militia, delivering water and food and helping to observe the enemy's situation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中十分区地武民兵　活跃平津近郊一年歼敌六千\n\n1948-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中十分区地武民兵\n    活跃平津近郊一年歼敌六千\n    【冀中电】冀中十分区地方武装及民兵、武工队，积极活动于平、津近郊，一年来获得很大战绩。全分区地方武装共作战五百七十九次，毙伤俘蒋伪团长翟宗洲（毙）、副团长牛步云（俘）、文安伪县长高泽洲（毙）以下官兵六千八百八十名；缴各种炮七门，轻重机枪九十三挺，步马枪二千零二十支，掷弹筒二十个，各种子弹十三万六千六百五十发。全分区民兵从今年一月到六月，半年中作战四百八十八次，毙伤俘敌七百二十四名。大清河北各地蒋伪军，在我军连续打击下，士气日益颓丧，逃亡、投诚者日益增多，据六月份一个月统计，十分区“蒋军退伍招待所”共收容逃亡及投诚之蒋伪官兵一千七百余人，比五月份增加三分之一，比一、二、三、四几个月收容的总数（七百余名）多一倍以上。\n    【又讯】十分区地武某部，英勇挺进永定河北大兴地区，在敌后积极打击敌人。六月二十三日，打跑驻小茨乡之伪军，缴枪二支。二十四日，在北王里村打击出动抢麦的土蒋刘翠然部，毙敌十名，伤敌一名，缴步枪二支。二十五日，袭击南各庄蒋匪据点，守敌狼狈逃窜，该点被我全部摧毁。\n    【冀中电】我清苑县干部，民兵，击退三十倍于己的蒋匪进犯，并毙伤匪四十二名，表现了高度的顽强勇敢。本月四日保定蒋匪暂卅二师两个团、暂卅三师两个营，结合土蒋共三千余人，带大车二百余辆，分三路向我清苑县大白团村、郎村及四区壁阳城一带进犯抢粮，我当地干部、民兵奋起抗击，与敌展开激烈的村落战。敌人曾集中兵力，在机枪大炮掩护下向我阵地发动三次冲锋，都被打退。某区大队长刘志，一人杀伤敌人七名。某区智区长领导民兵英勇抗击，杀伤敌人二十多名。当地群众冒着敌人的猛烈炮火积极支援作战民兵，送水送饭并帮助察看敌情。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th. The East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the Headquarters and Political Department of the East China Military Region, and the Shandong Provincial Government jointly sent a letter of condolence to all honored soldiers in East China on the \"July 7th\" anniversary. The original letter stated in brief: At the time of preparing to welcome the national revolutionary victory, it makes us more deeply aware of the meritorious servants of the Chinese people—the honored soldiers who, with selfless spirit, shed blood and sacrificed for the people in the cause of people's liberation, and created immortal feats. Although you have suffered physical damage, your achievements are great and your thoughts are healthy. Therefore, after returning to the local areas, you actively participated in production, supporting the front, land reform, and other constructive work, and always stood on the revolutionary front to fight tirelessly. This spirit is worthy of our admiration. Here, we warmly extend our cordial greetings and respect to you. The letter finally encouraged the honored soldiers to say: We should listen to Chairman Mao's words, further play a core exemplary role in production, supporting the front, and other work, organize the masses, raise the awareness of the masses, highly develop revolutionary heroism, and happily complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Chinese people, do a good job, and welcome victory.\n\n　　　　Dazhong Daily Editorial Calls For\n　　Party, Government, Army and People Should All Do a Good Job in Honored Soldiers Work　Honored Soldiers Should Strengthen Discipline, Production and Learning\n[Also News] Shandong Dazhong Daily published an editorial on \"July 7th\" entitled \"Salute to Honored Soldiers,\" pointing out that the work for honored soldiers in the past has been successful, with achievements in guaranteeing the lives of honored soldiers, political and cultural education, placement, and mobilizing them to return to the team. There are also many model deeds among the honored soldiers, such as saving money on food and clothing and donating disability funds to support the front. Many comrades work despite illness. In the past year, nearly 20,000 honored soldiers recovered from their injuries and returned to the front to kill the enemy. This all demonstrates the revolutionary heroism of the honored soldiers. The editorial continued to point out: There are still some shortcomings and errors in the work. For example, some places do not care about the lives of honored soldiers, and individual honored soldiers do not abide by government laws and disciplines, etc., and these errors must be corrected in a timely manner. The editorial put forward two requirements: (1) Party, government, military, and civilian organizations at all levels, Ronggong (Honored Workers) organs, and responsible comrades at all levels should attach importance to this work ideologically and realize that the quality of this work is directly related to the combat effectiveness and morale of the front. It is absolutely impossible to take an attitude of disgust, alienation, or even confrontation toward the honored soldiers because of the temporary poor performance of individual honored soldiers. We should review the work of honored soldiers in the past year, commend the good ones, overcome the bad phenomena, and even criticize and punish them when necessary. (2) Honored soldiers must abide by government laws, love the people, and must not think that they have contributed to the revolution and can destroy government laws and military-civilian relations. You must know that if the people's heroes are separated from the people, or even stand against the people, they will be opposed by the people. I hope that the honored soldiers will manage their bodies despite their glorious injuries and disabilities, but they must maintain ideological health. Always maintain the noble quality of serving the people, and become a model of discipline, learning, production, and all construction work, and always be respected by the people.\n\n　　　　Honored Soldier Comrade Yao Jie\nComrade Yao Jie is a specially honored soldier who is blind in both eyes and is now the political commissar of the Honored Soldiers Rehabilitation Institute. Although he has lost his sight, he has always maintained a high degree of work enthusiasm and a spirit of responsibility for the revolution. In 1944, he asked someone to read him the book \"How Steel Was Made?\" (Note: This book is a famous work by the Soviet writer Ostrovsky, in which the protagonist Paul is a young worker who contributes all his energy to arduous revolutionary work, resulting in injury and disability. Later, only his ears, mouth, and one hand can be used, but he still insists on working for the party to the end). He was greatly encouraged. He asked someone to read the entire book to him three times, and paragraph 17 was read more than seven times. He most admired the main character Paul's tenacious and unyielding spirit and his selfless work for the party, and asked himself to try his best to learn from Paul. Therefore, whenever he encountered difficulties, he used Paul's work spirit to encourage himself.\nHis only assistants in his work are a clerk and a literate correspondent. He often asks the clerk to read the instructions of the superiors to him, and then grasp the spirit of the documents, combine them with the actual situation, and then formulate a work plan. To make a summary report, he dictates it and the clerk records it. He used these methods to overcome the difficulties in his work.\nThe hospital headquarters is about a mile away from the nearest squadron, and three or four miles away from the farthest. Political Commissar Yao asked the correspondent to help him go to the squadrons to understand the situation no matter how far or near; he also went for a walk on rainy days. Many comrades said: \"Political Commissar Yao knows the situation more clearly than people with eyes.\" During the Three Check-Ups, he went to the class to participate in meetings every day, and corrected the bias in the class immediately when he discovered it. He often enlightened everyone with examples of how the work was done well in other teams, and gave instructions to everyone in a patient and persuasive manner.\nIn July last year, twenty deaf honored soldiers came to the Rehabilitation Institute. There was not enough time to arrange the beds. Political Commissar Yao gave up his bed and slept on the ground. So the comrades in the hospital department voluntarily gave up their beds. Once, two deaf honored soldiers had problems with their lives and were emotionally unstable. He asked someone to lead them to see his living conditions. After seeing it, the two comrades were very moved and rested in the hospital with peace of mind. There are six classes in the whole hospital, and some of the squad leaders are specially disabled. The first time the squad leader meeting was held, it happened to be raining at night, and it was very difficult for the squad leaders to go back. Political Commissar Yao regretted calling them to come. After that, he always went to the bottom to facilitate everyone. No matter whose ideology fluctuated, he patiently persuaded and educated them. Sun Chenglin, a specially honored soldier, was also blind in both eyes and hard of hearing. He went to chat with him every two or three days to comfort him, so that he could recognize a bright and optimistic future, and his emotions turned to stability and happiness. So some comrades said: \"Political Commissar Yao is really a mental doctor!\" [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 14th]\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东中央局、军区、山东省府　联函慰问华东荣军  勉励荣军努力生产支前迎接胜利\n\n1948-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华东中央局、军区、山东省府\n    联函慰问华东荣军\n    勉励荣军努力生产支前迎接胜利\n    【新华社华东十四日电】中共华东中央局、华东军区司令部、政治部、山东省政府，于“七七”联合致函慰问华东全体荣誉军人同志。原函略称：在准备迎接全国革命胜利的时候，使我们更深切地想到中国人民的功臣——荣誉军人在人民解放事业中，以忘我的精神，流血牺牲，为人民创立了不朽的功绩。你们虽然在肉体上遭受了损伤，但你们的功绩是伟大的，思想是健康的。因此当你们回到地方后，又积极地参加了生产、支前、土改及其他建设性的工作，始终站在革命战线上奋斗不息，这种精神是值得我们钦佩的。我们在这里热烈地向你们致亲切的慰问和敬意。该函最后勉励荣誉军人同志们称：应该听毛主席的话，在生产、支前等工作中进一步地起核心模范作用，组织群众，提高群众的觉悟程度，高度的发扬革命英雄主义，愉快地去完成当前中国人民交给我们的光荣任务，做好工作，迎接胜利。\n    　　　　大众日报社论号召\n    　　党政军民都要作好荣军工作　荣军应强加遵纪生产学习\n    【又讯】山东大众日报于“七七”发表题为“向荣誉军人同志们致敬”的社论，指出过去对于荣誉军人的工作是有成绩的，在荣誉军人生活的保证上，政治文化教育上，安插及动员归队上，都有成就。而荣誉军人中也有很多模范的事迹，如自己省吃节用，将残废金等献出支援前线，许多同志抱病工作，一年来有将近两万个荣军伤愈重返前线杀敌。这都表现出荣誉军人的革命英雄主义气概。社论继又指出：在工作中也还存在着一些缺点、错误。如某些地方对荣誉军人同志生活不关心，个别荣誉军人同志不遵守政府法令及纪律等，必须及时纠正这些错误。社论提出两点要求：（一）各级党政军民团体，各荣工机关，各级负责同志，应从思想上重视这一工作，认识到这一工作的好坏，是直接关系着前方战斗力与部队情绪的。切不可以个别荣誉军人的一时的不良表现，而对荣誉军人采取厌恶、疏远、甚至对抗态度。应该检讨过去一年的荣军工作，对好的予以表扬，对不良的现象加以克服，甚至必要时予以批评处分。（二）荣誉军人要遵守政府法令，爱护人民，切不可自以为对革命有功，便可以破坏政府法令及军民关系。要知道人民功臣如果脱离了人民，甚至与人民对立，那就要被人民反对的。希望荣誉军人管身体因光荣负伤而残废了，但要保持思想上的健康。永远保持为人民服务的高贵品质，成为遵纪、学习、生产及一切建设工作的模范，永远受到人民的尊敬。\n    　　　　荣誉军人姚杰同志\n    姚杰同志是个双目失明的特等荣誉军人，现在是荣军教养院的政治委员。他虽然已丧失视觉，但是始终保持高度的工作积极性和对革命负责的精神。在一九四四年时，他请人把“钢铁是怎样炼成的？”一书读给他听（按：该书是苏联作家奥斯特洛夫斯基名著，其中主角保尔是一个青年工人，贡献其全部精力于艰巨的革命工作，致因伤残废，后来四肢五官只有两耳一口一手能用，但他仍坚持为党工作到底），受到了很大的鼓励。他共请人把全书向他读了三遍，其中第十七段读了七遍之多。他最钦佩该书主要人物保尔那种顽强不屈及忘我的为党工作的精神，要求自己竭力向保尔学习。因此，每当遇到困难的时候，他就拿保尔的工作精神来勉励自己。\n    在他工作中唯一的助手是文书和一个识字的通讯员。他时常叫文书把上级的指示读给他听，然后掌握文件的精神，结合实际情况，再订出工作计划。要做总结报告便由他口述由文书笔录。就用这些办法，他克服了工作中的困难。\n    教养院院部离各中队近的有一里路，远的有三、四里。姚政委无论远近都叫通讯员搀扶着他到各中队去了解情况；下雨天也要去走一走。许多同志说：“姚政委比有眼睛的人了解的情况还要清楚。”在三查中，他每天都到班里去参加会议，发现班里有偏向时就即时纠正。他常常把别的队里工作是怎样做好的例子启发大家，循循善诱地给大家指示。\n    去年七月里，教养院来了二十个耳聋的荣军同志，一时搞床铺不及，姚政委便让出自己的床位，睡到地上去，于是院部的同志都把床铺自动让了出来。有一次两个耳聋的荣军同志闹生活问题，情绪不安，他便叫人领他们来看看自己的生活状况。这两个同志看后便很受感动地安心院里休养。全院共有六班，有的班长是特等残废。第一次开班长会议时，碰巧晚上下雨，班长们回去都很困难。姚政委很懊悔叫他们来，以后开会他总是到下边去就大家的便。无论那个同志思想发生波动，他都很耐心地进行说服教育，有一个特等荣军孙呈麟也是双目失明，两耳重听。他便三天两头地去和他闲谈，安慰他，使他认识光明乐观的前途，情绪转为安定愉快。所以有的同志说：“姚政委实在是精神医师！”【新华社华东十四日电】"

    "content": "The Purely Relief-Oriented Viewpoint Lacks Investigation and Research\n　　Problems Arise with Loans in the Pingxi Area\n[Chahar News] This spring, Pingxi issued a large number of agricultural loans to solve the various difficulties faced by the masses in spring plowing and sowing, to support the masses in developing sideline production, and to overcome the spring famine, which played a significant role. When the masses in Baoshui Village, Fangshan, were worried about having nothing to eat and no way to cultivate the land, the government issued 5,000 catties of loan grain to the village, organized manpower and livestock, and planted all the land in the village in 20 days. In the severely disaster-stricken first district of Liangxiang, 81 head of livestock were purchased with loan grain to support spring plowing and sowing. However, in the issuance of loans, considerable deviations occurred in many places: some propaganda for agricultural loans was too exaggerated, and many people relied solely on agricultural loans, complaining about the government for lending too little. For example, some district cadres in Changwan promoted to the masses that \"you can borrow as much as you want, and you can borrow whatever you want.\" One small village requested loans of four to five million yuan. Because the number was too large, they were asked to reinvestigate several times, which caused resentment and dissatisfaction among the masses. Later, the county only allowed a loan of 4 million yuan, which the masses considered too little. After explanation, they finally took the loan. In Laishui, some district cadres promoted to the masses that \"those who did not overturn themselves in the land reform can use more loans.\" The masses mistakenly believed that borrowing grain and money was a form of relief, and Pingtingshan Village, with more than 50 households, requested a loan of 100 million yuan. Before the issuance of agricultural loans, due to a lack of investigation and research and insufficient understanding of the situation, the focus was determined subjectively, which was inconsistent with the actual situation. Muzigang Village in Huailai was the poorest and only received a loan of 2 million yuan and 3 large stones of grain, while Zhuanggou Village, which was very wealthy, received a loan of 5 million yuan and 6 large stones of grain. In some places, the issuance of loans was not taken seriously. The agricultural loans in two districts of Fangshan were directly controlled and issued by the county without any review by the districts. They were introduced to the county without district screening, and the county lent the money without review, resulting in loans being given to many who should not have received them. Many places distributed the money evenly. Huangta Village in Wanping divided the loaned grain at a rate of 11.5 jin per person. Cadres in the second and third districts of Laizhou were afraid of being criticized for lending incorrectly, so they delayed issuing the loaned grain. The second district had not distributed the agricultural loans for more than a month. Some areas did not check after issuing loan grain and money and did not organize production, so the loans did not play their due role. Anjiagai Village in the first district of Huailai used the loans to engage in transportation and sales, and the director of the new peasant association even said, \"This loan is given by the government to the cadres because the cadres delay production.\" The masses were very dissatisfied.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 单纯救济观点缺乏调查研究　平西贷款出了毛病\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　单纯救济观点缺乏调查研究\n    平西贷款出了毛病\n    【察哈尔讯】今春平西发放大批农贷，解决群众春耕播种中的各种困难，扶助群众开展副业生产，渡过春荒，曾起了不少作用。房山宝水庄群众正发愁没吃的、没法种地时，政府发给该村五千斤贷粮，把人畜力组织起来，在廿天中将全村的土地全部种上。良乡灾惨重的一区各村，用贷粮购买八十一头牲畜，支持了春耕下种。但在发放贷款中，不少地方发生了相当的偏向：有的对农贷的宣传太夸大，好多群众单纯依靠农贷，嫌农贷少而埋怨政府。如昌宛有的区干部向群众宣传说：“贷多少给多少，贷什么给什么”，有一个小村就要求贷四、五千万元。因为数字太大，让他们重新调查了好几次，结果引起群众的厌烦和不满，后来县里只允许贷给四百万元，群众嫌少，经过解释后，才贷了去。涞水有的区干部向群众宣传说：“在土改中没翻了身的，可多使贷款。”群众误认为贷粮贷款是一笔救济，五十多户的平顶山村就要求贷一亿元。在农贷发放前，由于缺乏调查研究，对情况了解不够，主观的确定重点，和实际情况不符。怀来木子港村最穷、只贷到款二百万元，贷粮三大石；很富裕的庄户村却贷款五百万元，贷粮六大石。有的地方对贷款发放不认真。房山有两个区的农贷，是由县直接掌握发放，区里不加审查。就往县里介绍，县里也不审查就贷给，结果好多不应贷的都贷了。不少地方是平均分配，宛平黄塔村按每人十一斤半分了贷粮。涞涿二、三区干部怕贷错了受批评，将贷粮搁着不放，二区把农贷放了一个多月还没有发放下去。有的地区发下贷粮贷款不检查，不组织生产，致使农贷未起到应有的作用。怀来一区安家碍村领回贷，村干部就用贷款搞起运销来，新农会主任还说：“这款是政府贷给干部的，因为干部耽误生产。”群众很不满意。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. American Ambassador John Leighton Stuart has publicly admitted the bankruptcy of his \"credibility,\" saying, \"I thought I could use my credibility to make the Chinese people believe that the United States was not supporting Japan, but the Chinese people do not believe it.\" This is Stuart's confession to representatives of students from North China on June 26th, after the entire Chinese public severely condemned his absurd statement on June 4th. According to a report from Peiping in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on June 27th: The \"United Association Against the United States Supporting Japan and Rescuing the National Crisis,\" composed of students from 13 universities and colleges in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan, sent representatives to meet with John Leighton Stuart on June 26th, and directly condemned his statement on June 4th as \"damaging to the dignity of the Chinese people,\" expressing that Chinese students' opposition to the United States supporting Japan is not opposition to the American people, nor is it opposition to the improvement of the living standards of the Japanese people, but opposition to the United States' support for the resurgence of Japanese fascism to threaten China. The representatives also elaborated that the Chinese student movement since the May Fourth Movement has been constructive, and the students' love for the country and the nation, and the patriotic movement against the United States supporting Japan, is a continuation of this glorious tradition. Although the Chinese student movement has been subjected to high-pressure persecution by those in power since the May Fourth Movement, it is still advancing heroically. The student representatives submitted a memorandum compiled by the association on the facts of North China students' opposition to the United States supporting Japan to Stuart, asking him to forward it to the US State Department.

Before the distribution, village branch committees, Party member meetings, and village cadre meetings were held separately to discuss the distribution targets and methods. Many people revealed dependent thoughts, complaining that the agricultural loans were too small, and exhibited a \"component-only\" viewpoint. When discussing Zhang Fuquan and Zhang Fuxing, some people suggested, \"They were originally landlords and rich peasants, and although they have difficulties, they should not be given loans.\" Some people raised different opinions: \"Zhang Fuxing was indeed a landlord and rich peasant, but after the land reform, he has actively engaged in production and has done a good job in supporting corvee labor and standing guard. Now that he does have difficulties, we should help him solve them, or he will be a burden to our village.\" Others said: \"The purpose of loans is to promote production. If they can produce well, they should be given loans.\" As a result, the latter opinion was adopted. The question of whether lazy man Du Bao should be given a loan caused heated debate. Finally, it was decided to lend to him in the spirit of transforming and educating him on the one hand, and solving his difficulties on the other. At the village cadre meeting, Production Committee member Fu Jingwen suggested that the amount of grain loans was not much, and he himself could forgo the loan. Everyone knew that he was the most impoverished household in the village and repeatedly persuaded and explained, but it was still decided to give him a loan. At these meetings, eighteen borrowing households were initially decided upon. Then, a mass meeting was held to review and decide on each household. Wang Chaohuan still had more than one shi of grain in storage, and he was not a very impoverished household, so everyone removed him from the list. Someone suggested adding Wang Yongqing and Wang Ji, and everyone approved. After the meeting, cadres summoned the grain-borrowing households to discuss production methods and immediately helped Cheng Jingchao, Zhang Fuxing, and Han Jufu formulate production plans. Other grain-borrowing households will also make plans one after another to make the most effective use of the grain loans. The masses have commented, \"This time the grain loan is truly fair and reasonable, with no favoritism.\" \"Although the grain loan is not much, it solves many problems.\" Everyone is very satisfied.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 塔河村民主发放贷款　解决各阶层生产困难\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　塔河村民主发放贷款\n    解决各阶层生产困难\n    【察哈尔讯】宛平一区塔河村发放农贷时，充分发扬民主，召开各种会议反复研究，发动群众逐户审查，并具体帮助借贷户订生产计划，效果良好，群众满意。在发放以前，分别召开村支部委员会、党员大会、村干部会，讨论发放的对象与办法，不少人暴露出嫌农贷太少的依赖思想和唯成份论的观点，讨论到张甫全和张甫兴时，有人提出：“他们原来是地主富农，虽有困难，也不应贷给他们。”有人提出不同意见：“张甫兴原来确系地富，但土改后他也积极搞生产，支差站岗也挺好，现在确是有困难，就应给他解决，要不也是咱村的累赘。”还有的说：“贷款为的是促进生产，他们能够好好生产，就该贷给他们。”结果后面的意见被通过。懒汉杜宝是否该贷款的问题引起热烈的争论，最后确定本着一面改造教育，一面解决困难的精神贷给他。在村干部会上，生产委员傅景文提出贷粮贷款数量不多，自己可以不贷。大家知道他是本村最困难的一户，一再劝说解释，还是决定要贷给他。在这些会上，初步决定了十八户借贷对象。接着召开群众会议，逐户审查决定。王朝焕还存着一石多粮食，他不是很困难户，大家把他从名单里减下来，有人提出添上王永庆和王继两户，大家都通过了。会后干部召集贷粮户讨论生产办法，当场先帮助程景朝、张甫兴、韩巨福三户作了生产计划，其他贷粮户也将陆续作出，以便最有效的使用贷粮。群众纷纷反映说：“这回贷粮可真公平合理，一点私情也没有。”“贷粮虽不多，解决的问题可不少。”大家都很满意。"

Currently, it has been discovered in 25 districts of eight counties, including Tangyin, Anyang, Ci County, Lin County, Zhangnan, She County, Shahe, and Neiqiu. The types of insect pests include mole crickets, locusts, darkling beetles, cutworms, grubs, wireworms, walnut weevils, underground worms, and dermestid beetles. Statistics from 76 villages in 16 districts of seven counties show that 22,000 mu of field crops have been damaged. The most severely affected area, Zhangnan, has suffered insect plagues in one-third of its villages. Mole crickets have been widely found in ten districts of Anyang. In seven districts and twenty villages alone, 4,834 mu of autumn seedlings have been destroyed. These pests were first discovered in various locations in early June, with mole crickets being the most numerous, followed by locusts and darkling beetles. In the densest areas, one could step on five or six with each footstep, and in less dense areas, there were a dozen or more with each step. After the insect plague occurred, the Fifth Administrative Office dispatched special personnel to the affected areas to assist local governments in leading the masses to eradicate the pests. It was also stipulated that each county should report the local insect plague situation and eradication efforts to the local Party committee and the administrative office daily. The Sixth Administrative Office designated the secretaries of the county governments to be responsible for grasping the situation, taking the initiative in leadership, and mobilizing forces in a timely manner to eradicate the pests based on the development of the situation. After mobilization meetings for insect eradication were held by county, district, and village cadres and the masses, insect eradication headquarters at the county, district, and joint defense levels were formed from top to bottom. Anyang has now launched a widespread mass insect eradication campaign. In the Seventh District, 103 out of 106 natural villages, with 5,679 people, have been involved in the movement within two days. Twenty-five villages have already eliminated 6,880 cartloads of mole crickets, and the entire district will be able to eliminate them all within three more days. In the five villages of Madian, Liuma, and others in the Eighth District of Lin County, which was the most severely affected by insect pests, mole crickets have been basically eliminated. In the four villages of Beiliang, Fengtang, and others in Ci County, 1,136 jin of darkling beetles were captured in one and a half days, saving 400 mu of autumn seedlings. According to statistics from 59 villages in Anyang, Lin County, and Neiqiu counties, 16,122 mu of autumn seedlings have been saved.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行八县发生虫害　群众正加紧扑灭\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行八县发生虫害\n    群众正加紧扑灭\n    【太行讯】太行入夏以来久未落雨，近复发生虫害，损伤秋禾，尤以平汉沿线为甚。目下已发现者，计有汤阴、安阳、磁县、林县、漳南、涉县、沙河、内邱等八县的二十五个区。虫害种类，计有土蚂蚱、蝗虫、黑婆婆、蝼蛄、蛴螬、铁绒虫、核桃虫、地下虫、皮牛等。七个县十六个区七十六个村统计，受害田禾已有二万二千亩。最严重的漳南有三分之一村庄遭虫灾。安阳十个区普遍发现土蚂蚱，仅七区二十个村，即有四千八百三十四亩秋苗被咬毁。各地害虫于六月上旬先后发现，以土蚂蚱为最多，蝗虫、黑婆婆次之，其最密处一脚可踏五、六个，稀处每步有十几个。虫害发生后，五专署已派专人赴各灾区，协助当地政府领导群众灭除。并规定各县每天向地委、专署汇报当地虫害及扑灭情况。六专署指定各县府秘书负责掌握情况，主动领导，根据情况发展，及时调动力量扑灭。各地经过县区村干部与群众除虫动员大会，自上而下的组成县、区、联防各级除虫指挥部。安阳现已掀起广泛的群众性的除虫运动。七区一百零六个自然村，两天内有一百零三村、五千六百七十九人卷入运动。有二十五村已消灭了六千八百八十车蚂蚱，全区再有三天即可全部消灭。林县虫害最严重的八区马店、刘马等五个村，土蚂蚱已基本上消灭。磁县北良、冯唐等四村，一天半捉了一千一百三十六斤黑婆婆，救活了四百亩秋苗。据安阳、林县、内邱三县五十九个村统计，已救活的秋苗达一万六千一百二十二亩。"

The national chemical workers' strike was on the 6th, the national electricity workers' strike was on the 7th, the national steel workers' strike was on the 8th, the national glass, pottery, and sugar workers' strike was on the 9th, and the national gas workers' strike was on the 12th. A total of approximately three million people participated in the staged general strike from the 6th to the 12th, with the largest being the steel workers' strike, involving 850,000 people. The direct purpose of the strike is to demand wage increases, but it also has significant political implications. The Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour issued a public statement on the 7th stating that if the employers (Federation of Industrialists) remain stubborn, the Executive Committee will consider a national general strike if necessary. The public statement of the Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour also stated that the trade union committees of the northern Italian states are scheduled to meet in Milan on the 11th, and the trade union committees of the central and southern states will also hold consultations in Naples. The General Confederation of Labour will base its further actions on the opinions of these state trade unions.\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS reports: The Italian government has taken a series of reactionary measures to suppress the strike movement that has surged in Italy in recent weeks. According to \"The People's Paper,\" the organ of Gasperi, the Council of Ministers has reiterated its intention to enact legislation restricting the right of the working people to strike. Interior Minister Scelba has drafted a plan to immediately militarize the railways, post offices, telecommunications, and many other departments when workers in these departments demand wage increases and call for strikes. In addition to military and political measures, the government is planning to establish strike-breaking teams to counter trade unions and the strike movement. The Italian government has decided to adopt the so-called \"Fanfani (Minister of Labour) Plan,\" attempting to place the entire burden of the crisis and the resumption of work in the country on the shoulders of the working people. The Italian government has also promulgated another \"Labor Service\" decree drafted by Fanfani regarding the establishment of the obligations of the unemployed, as a means of organized strike-breaking. These measures of the Italian government have aroused widespread anger among the working people. Various democratic newspapers have strongly protested the \"Fanfani Plan,\" which is only supported by the Christian Democratic Party, and the newspapers demand that this plan be amended during parliamentary debate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意各业工人行动一致　分期罢工按期举行　反动政府阴谋进行破坏\n\n1948-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　意各业工人行动一致\n    分期罢工按期举行\n    反动政府阴谋进行破坏\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：具有“象征示威”性质的意大利总工会所领导的全国各业工人分期总罢工，继二日之后，已于六日至十二日按期陆续举行。六日为全国化学工人的罢工，七日为全国电力工人的罢工，八日为全国钢铁工人的罢工，九日为全国玻璃、陶器和制糖工人的罢工，十二日为全国煤气工人的罢工。总计约有三百万人参加自六日至十二日的分期总罢工，其中最大的一次是钢铁工人的罢工，计有八十五万人参加。罢工的直接目的是要求增资，同时亦具有重大的政治意义。总工会执委会于七日发表公报称，如雇主们（工业家联合会）的态度顽固不变，在必要时，执委会将考虑全国总罢工。总工会执委会之公报又称，意北之各州之工会委员会定于十一日在米兰集会，中部及南部各州之工会委员会亦于那不勒斯举行会商。总工会将根据这些州工会的意见，以决定其进一步的行动。\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社报导：意大利政府已采取一连串反动措施，以镇压最近数周在意大利风起云涌的罢工运动。据加斯贝利的机关报“人民报”称，部长会议已再度表明欲制定限制劳动人民罢工权利的立法。内政部长谢尔巴已拟就当铁路、邮局、电讯及其他许多部门之工人要求增资而号召罢工时立即将这些部门军事化的计划。除军事和政治的措施外，政府正计划建立罢工破坏队，以对付职工会和罢工运动。意政府已决定采取所谓“法凡尼（劳工部长）计划”，企图将危机及国内恢复工作的全部负担，放在劳动人民的肩上。意政府又颁布由法凡尼起草的另一关于确立失业者义务的“劳动服务”法令，作为有组织的破坏罢工的手段。意政府的这些措施，已激起劳动人民的普遍愤怒。各民主报纸严重抗议只受到基督教民主党支持的“法凡尼计划”，各报要求在国会辩论中修改这一计划。"

    "content": "(North Yue News) Lingshou has not had rain for a long time and is showing signs of drought. The County Party Committee issued emergency instructions a few days ago, calling on all cadres to lead the masses in repairing water conservancy and fighting the drought. The instructions stated: In our county's Lingzheng Canal, there is a chaotic situation of opening the gates to steal water, with the upstream not caring about the downstream, and agreements are not being enforced; the Tanzhuang Canal Water Committee is just a formality, lacking leadership, the canal body has not been repaired in a timely manner, and water use is not fair or reasonable. Other canals also have varying degrees of undisciplined, unscientific, and unreasonable phenomena. Wells also exist in an unled and unorganized state, with some people able to water every day while others are anxiously waiting. The instructions pointed out: Water committees of each canal should be immediately organized and rectified, with division of responsibilities, and immediate repairs should be made. Each district should send special personnel to lead. A representative meeting of villages benefiting from the canals should be convened to formulate scientific and reasonable management methods and disciplines and systems that everyone should abide by in the future. Leaders should be fully prepared in advance and submit a relatively complete draft for discussion at the representative meeting, and should not endlessly argue at the meeting, so that the problem cannot be resolved perfectly. The Party Committee and the government should cooperate with the Water Committee to lead the meeting. Organize wells: In Shangshao Village, District Four, each well should have one person as the well head, and the whole village should set up a well committee to solve the problem of water use separately. Make sure the windlass is never away from the well, and use it in shifts day and night. This method can be used as a reference.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 整修水利抗旱　灵寿县委紧急指示\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　整修水利抗旱\n    灵寿县委紧急指示\n    【北岳讯】灵寿久未落雨，已呈旱象。县委在日前发出紧急指示，号召全体干部，领导群众整修水利，与旱象作斗争。指示称：我县灵正渠存在开闸盗水，上游不管下游，订出公约不执行的混乱状态；谭庄渠道水委会形同虚设，漫无领导，渠身没有及时兴修，用水也欠公平合理。其他渠道也都有程度不同的无纪律、不科学，不合理的现象。水井同样存在无领导无组织状态，有人能天天浇，有人则干着急。指示指出：应立即组织与整顿各渠道的水委会，分工负责，立即兴修，各区要派专人去领导。召开渠道受益村的代表会，制定今后科学合理的管理办法和全体遵守的纪律与制度。领导者事先要有充分准备，提出较完备之草案交代表会讨论，不应漫无休止的在会上争吵，使问题不得完善解决。党委与政府应协同水委会去领导会议。组织水井：四区上邵村每井设一人为井头，全村设水井委员会，分别解决使水问题。作到辘辘不离井，日夜分班使用，这种办法可供参考。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th: The most extensive project in the second phase of the Bohai Yellow River spring repairs, the dangerous sections of the Huang Dam and Qian Embankment in Mawan, Putai County, were completed in early June. The dam is 22 li long, employing a total of 241,192 workers and using 361,920 cubic meters of earth. In 1937, due to the corruption and neglect of the Kuomintang River Affairs Bureau, a severe flood occurred in the area. The people of Guangrao, Boxing, and Putai counties suffered immense losses, with 300 square li of fertile land submerged under a 1.2-meter-thick layer of gravel. Last year, after the Kuomintang government violated the agreement and blocked the mouth of the Yellow River at Huayuankou in a plot to flood the liberated areas and their military and civilians, the area once again faced the serious threat of the Yellow River's disasters. Therefore, the local people were extremely excited and actively participated in this dam repair led by the democratic government. People from Wuqiao, Zhenhua (formerly Ningjin), Dongguang, Wudi, and Yangxin counties also formed a Yellow River Control Expeditionary Force of more than 16,000 people to participate in the project. During the construction of the river project, a widespread campaign to earn merit was launched, with thousands of river workers receiving recognition, and eleven model companies emerging. The entire project saved more than 71,500 workdays compared to the original plan. Currently, all the river workers in this section have returned to their homes. Local farmers are actively going to the fields to produce and reclaim wasteland.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 渤海人民奋力抢修蒲台麻湾险工竣工\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　渤海人民奋力抢修蒲台麻湾险工竣工\n    【新华社华东十五日电】渤海黄河二期春修中工程最浩大的蒲台县麻湾皇坝和前堤险工，已于六月初竣工。该坝全长廿二里，共用工廿四万一千一百九十二个，用土三十六万一千九百二十方。该地于一九三七年时因国民党河务局腐败失修，造成严重水灾。广饶、博兴、蒲台三县人民损失浩大，三百方里良田为一·二公尺厚的砂砾淹没，去年国民党政府阴谋水淹解放区军民而在花园口违约堵口后，该地即又面临黄祸的严重威胁。因此当地人民对此次民主政府领导修堤，异常兴奋，积极参加。吴桥、振华（原宁津）、东光、无棣、阳信等五县人民并组成一万六千余人的治黄远征军参加工程。河工在修筑中广泛掀起了立功运动，成千河工立了功，并涌现十一个模范连。全部工程较原计划省工七万一千五百余个。现该段治黄民工已全部复员。当地农民正积极上地生产，开垦荒地。"

    "content": "[Taiyue Telegraph] The Yangcheng County government recently sent people to various villages to inspect the spring plowing and crop conditions, and found that the drought was very serious. 180,000 mu of replanted land in the county has not yet been sown. On the 12th, it dispatched cadres to six districts to organize the masses to carry out spot sowing, dry sowing, and rush sowing. When they arrived in the villages, they first patiently mobilized the cadres and the masses ideologically, and promoted the valuable experience of overcoming drought last year. Those who have not yet spot sown should seize the time to spot sow, and those who have already spot sown should continue to spot sow more. In places with rivers, canals, and wells, irrigate and sow underground. Where water is scarce, organize to carry water for spot sowing and dry sowing. Last year, the county spot sowed a total of 5,393 mu of corn, with an average yield of eight dou and eight sheng of corn per mu. Those who waited for rain to replant only harvested an average of two dou and three sheng per mu. Those who waited for rain suffered losses, while those who rushed to plant in advance benefited. Educating the masses with last year's practical examples has achieved great results.\n[Taiyue Telegraph] On the 10th, the Fifth District of Yangcheng convened a meeting of production committee members from twelve villages including Mazhai to discuss the repair of canals, the diversion of water for irrigation, and the fight against drought. These twelve villages have 1,800 mu of dry land that can be turned into paddy fields, but because many problems have not been resolved, water conservancy has not been well utilized: (1) There is no leadership or organization during canal repairs. Some people go, some people don't, and everyone is not of one mind. (2) In the past, after canals were repaired, water was used unfairly for irrigation. Those upstream watered two or three times, while those downstream could not water even once. Everyone was afraid of getting angry and fighting, and no one wanted to repair the canal and divert water. (3) In the past, every canal repair lacked a unified plan. People only started repairing when the seedlings were about to die from drought. After the repairs, no one kept track of how much labor was wasted, and whoever took the lead would suffer. After discussing the above problems, everyone agreed that to overcome the drought, canals should be repaired and water diverted immediately. The following methods were decided on the spot: (1) Unified leadership. Villages with 50 mu of water land should establish a water conservancy committee, with the production committee member primarily responsible. Solve various problems that arise during canal repair. (2) The labor used for canal repair should be shared equally according to the number of mu of water land. Households with water land cannot provide labor but can pay wages. (3) When irrigating, the upstream and downstream should take turns, watering each place once before starting over from the beginning, overcoming the past unfair phenomenon. At present, except for Mazhai, Beitoumiao and other villages where the project is relatively difficult and work has not started, most of the other villages have started work. Dingdian Village has repaired a section, which can irrigate more than 200 mu of land. The district base point work team has extracted cadres to various villages to conduct inspections and supervision, and to help various villages solve problems.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 组织群众修渠点种阳城抓紧领导抗旱\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　组织群众修渠点种阳城抓紧领导抗旱\n    【太岳电】阳城县政府最近派人到各村检查春耕与青苗情形，发现荒旱十分严重，全县回茬地尚有十八万亩未曾下种。即于十二日派出干部，分赴六个区组织群众进行点种、干种、抢种。他们到了村里，首先从思想上耐心动员干部和群众，发扬去年战胜旱灾的各种宝贵经验，没点种的抓紧点种，已点种的继续多点，有河、有渠、有井的地方灌地下种，水缺的地方组织起来担水点种及干种。去年全县共点种玉茭五千三百九十三亩，每亩平均收玉茭八斗八升，等雨回茬的每亩平均只收了二斗三升。等雨的吃了亏，预先抢种的沾了光，用去年的现实例子教育群众，收到很大效果。\n    【太岳电】阳城五区于十日召开马寨等十二村的生产委员开会，讨论修理水渠，引水浇地，战胜旱灾问题。这十二个村有一千八百亩旱地可以变成水田，因为有许多问题没解决，水利就没有很好的利用起来：（一）修渠时没人领导，没有组织。这个去那个不去，大家不齐心。（二）过去修了渠，浇地使水不公，在上水的两遍三遍的浇，在下水的一遍也浇不上。大家怕生气打架，谁也不想修渠引水。（三）过去每次修渠都没有统一计划，苗子快旱死了才去修，修了以后，谁误了多少工也不上帐，谁出头谁吃亏。讨论了上面这些问题，大家都认为要战胜旱灾，应该立刻修渠引水。当场决定了以下几个办法：（一）统一领导，凡有水地五十亩的村子，都成立水利委员会，由生产委员负主要责任。解决修渠中发生的各种问题。（二）修渠用的工，按水地亩数平均负担，水地户不能出工，可以出工资。（三）浇地时上下水轮流浇，都浇过一遍以后，再从头轮，克服过去不公现象。现在除马寨，北头庙等村因工程比较困难没有动工外，其余村大部已开了工。町店村已修通一段，能浇地二百多亩。区基点工作组抽出干部，到各村进行检查督促，帮助各村解决问题。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: According to comprehensive reports from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, in late June, major cities under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, except for Shanghai, continued to be shaken by the violent surge in prices, with the rate of increase exceeding that of Shanghai. In Tianjin, on June 26th, a bag of \"Warship Brand\" flour cost 16 million Jiao coins, an increase of more than threefold compared to 3.65 million Jiao coins on the 1st of the month; rice cost 360,000 Jiao coins per jin, an increase of 3.3 times compared to 84,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st of the month (and higher than the rice price in Shanghai on the same day by 50%); millet cost 250,000 Jiao coins per jin, an increase of threefold compared to 63,000 Jiao coins on the 1st; corn flour cost 170,000 Jiao coins per jin, an increase of 2.4 times compared to 50,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st; and \"Red Flag Five Blessings\" cloth cost 31 million Jiao coins per bolt, 3.68 times the 8.45 million Jiao coins on the 1st.\n\nOn June 20th, \"Warship Brand\" flour in Beiping was already selling for 8.2 million Jiao coins per bag (still 3.4 million Jiao coins per bag on the 1st), and Xiaozhan rice cost 260,000 Jiao coins per jin, about three times the rice price of 85,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st; corn flour cost 120,000 Jiao coins per jin, also nearly three times the price of 47,000 Jiao coins per jin on the 1st. Many cigarette and sesame cake stalls in the market have voluntarily closed down.\n\nFrom the 15th to the 25th of last month, in just ten days, \"Warship Brand\" flour in Qingdao increased from 4.5 million Jiao coins per bag to 6.5 million Jiao coins, raw oil increased from 37 million Jiao coins per dan to 50 million Jiao coins, and \"Double Dragon\" fine cloth increased from 11.8 million Jiao coins per bolt to 23.5 million Jiao coins.\n\nThe price increase in Jinan \"is like a hurricane, surpassing any place in the country in just a few days\" (see Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, June 24th). The price increase in Xi'an is also fierce. According to a Tianjin Ta Kung Pao dispatch from Xi'an on the 21st, in one week, \"flour has risen directly from 1.8 million to 2.3 million per bag, and when people wake up after a night's sleep, it's another 3.3 million, and there is a price but no market, and the black market has already broken through the 4 million mark.\"\n\nThe malignant surge in prices in Taiyuan has seen increases three or four times within an hour. As of the 20th of last month, \"Double Elephant Brand\" flour was selling for 26 million Jiao coins per bag, a small piece of laundry soap cost 400,000 Jiao coins, a small package of coffee cigarettes cost 700,000 Jiao coins, sorghum flour cost 370,000 Jiao coins per jin, and an egg cost 60,000 Jiao coins. Dozens of \"cooperatives\" and \"rationing departments\" throughout the city did not open for business on the 19th and 20th.\n\nIn Shenyang, on the 25th of last month, prices \"rose three times a day.\" Sorghum rice had risen to 690,000 Jiao coins per jin, and \"Warship Brand\" flour had risen to 46 million Jiao coins per bag, nearly twice the price of flour in Tianjin, and \"grain has disappeared from the market, and people are extremely panicked.\"\n\nUnder the violent rule and plunder of the Kuomintang, grain prices in Changchun continue to rise, and the grain shortage is becoming increasingly serious, with 500,000 residents generally trapped in starvation. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 1st of this month, citing the Xin Sheng Bao, only 20% of the city's residents can still afford to eat rice, 21% eat porridge, 23% eat bean cakes (usually used as animal feed), 17% eat tree bark, and 19% beg on the streets.\n\nAccording to the Tianjin Min Guo Daily, on the 24th of last month, two anti-hunger demonstrations occurred in the city in one day, one by railway workers demanding that their supervising officials' stockpiled grain be \"taken out and shared,\" and the other by citizens demanding that \"the grain stored by wealthy households in the city be exposed.\"\n\nAnother report: Rice prices in Wuhan had already risen to 10.8 million Jiao coins per dan as early as June 17th, higher than the then rice price in Shanghai (10 million Jiao coins).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区各大城市物价六月下旬暴涨情况\n\n1948-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区各大城市物价六月下旬暴涨情况\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：六月下旬，蒋介石统治下的除上海以外的各大城市均继续为暴烈的六月物价大涨风所震撼，其上涨速度较之上海有过之而无不及。天津的物价，上月二十六日兵船粉每袋蒋币一千六百万元，较一日的每袋三百六十五万，上涨三倍多；大米每斤三十六万元，较一日的每斤八万四千元，上涨三点三倍（并高于同日上海米价百分之五十）；小米每斤二十五万元，较一日的六万三千上涨三倍；玉米面每斤十七万元，较一日的每斤五万元上涨二点四倍；红牌五福布每匹三千一百万元，为一日八百四十五万元的三点六八倍。上月二十日北平兵船面粉已卖到每袋八百二十万元（一日尚为每袋三百四十万元），小站稻米每斤二十六万元，约为一日米价每斤八万五千的三倍，玉米面每斤十二万，亦为一日每斤四万七千元之价的三倍弱。现市面的香烟摊、烧饼摊很多已自动歇业。从上月十五日至二十五日十天中，青岛兵船牌面粉每袋由四百五十万元，涨至六百五十万元，生油每担由三千七百万元涨至五千万元，双龙细布每匹由一千一百八十万元，涨至二千三百五十万元。济南物价“更如狂风暴雨，不旬日即高出全国任何地方之上”（见六月二十四日天津大公报）。西安物价涨风亦猛，据天津大公报载二十一日西安通讯称：一周中，“面粉已由一百八十万一袋，直升到二百三十万，人们睡一夜起来，又是三百三十万了，而且有价无市，黑市早已突破四百万元大关”。太原物价的恶性猛涨，有在一小时内提升三、四次者，截至上月二十日止，双象牌面粉已卖到每袋二千六百万元，一小块洗衣肥皂要四十万元，一小包咖啡烟要七十万元，高粱面每斤三十七万，一个鸡蛋要六万元。全城数十处“合作社”及“配给部”于十九、二十两日竟日没有开门营业。沈阳物价上月二十五日更是“一日三涨”，高粱米已涨至每斤卖蒋币六十九万元，兵船粉已涨至每袋四千六百万元，几高出天津面粉价格两倍，且“粮已绝市，人心极为恐慌”。国民党暴力统治掠夺下的长春，粮价不断上涨，粮荒日益严重，五十万居民普遍陷于饥饿绝境。据美联社本月一日电引新生报载称：全市居民还吃得到饭的仅占百分之二十，其余百分之二十一吃粥，百分之二十三吃豆饼（平常为牲口饲料），百分之十七吃树皮，百分之十九行乞街头。据天津民国日报消息：上月二十四日一日内，该市即发生两起反饥饿示威，一为铁路工人要求将其主管官员所囤积的粮食，“拿出来分吃”，另一则为市民要求“检举市内富户的存粮”。另息：武汉米价早在六月十七日即已涨至每担一千零八十万元，而高出于当时的上海米价（一千万元）。"

The journal published a lengthy article by Sharpanchyev entitled \"The Leading Organs of the Yugoslav Communist Party's Revision of Marxist-Leninist Theory on the Party.\" The author writes: The leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party have revised the foundations of Marxist-Leninist theory on the Party, and the invincible strength of the Party has been proven by the experience of the international workers' movement throughout history. The consistent line of the YCP leaders is to diminish the role of the Communist Party, dissolving it into the extremely broad non-Party organization of the National Front, which includes members of all classes. This is undermining the foundation of the Party and endangering its very survival, rendering it incapable of being an independent political force, the highest form of organization of the working class, and the most important weapon in the struggle for socialism. The article points out: The Yugoslav National Front undoubtedly played a significant role during the Yugoslav people's anti-fascist war of liberation, and there is no doubt that the National Front can and should be an important tool for cooperation among all democratic forces domestically at present. However, the National Front cannot replace the Communist Party, and it can only play its proper role under the leadership of the Communist Party. The article severely criticizes the opportunist line of the current leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party, pointing out that it is causing the Yugoslav Communist Party to gradually lose its status as an independent political force. Sharpanchyev writes: Eliminating the system of terror within the Party, eradicating bureaucracy in Party organizations and their activities, making the Party's existence fully open, strengthening Party life, regularly convening Party congresses and delegate conferences, developing the active and independent creative work of Party members, developing inner-Party democracy, and developing criticism and self-criticism—these are the primary tasks that real life presents to the Yugoslav Communist Party at present. The author concludes by writing: There can be no doubt that the Yugoslav Communist Party, with its glorious fighting tradition, will be able to find sufficient strength to eradicate the existing system of terror within the Party, eliminate the incorrect line of the current leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party—a line that deviates from Marxism-Leninism—and, under the great banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, with the support of the Communist Parties of other countries, lead the Yugoslav working masses to fight for the victory of socialism.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 论南共领导机关修改马列关于党的学说\n\n1948-07-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　论南共领导机关修改马列关于党的学说\n    （情报局机关刊）\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科八日广播：共产党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平与人民民主”第十三期于七月一日在罗京布加勒斯特出版。该刊登载沙尔盘奇耶题为“南斯拉夫共产党领导机关修改马克思、列宁关于党的学说”的长篇论文。作者写道：南斯拉夫共产党领导者修改了马克思、列宁关于党的学说的基础，而党的不可战胜的力量，已由历来的国际工人运动的经验所证明。南共领导者一贯路线是降低共产党的作用，使党溶化在包含各阶层分子的极广泛的非党组织民族阵线中，这是破坏党的基础和危及党本身的生存，使其不能成为独立的政治力量，不能成为工人阶级最高的组织形式，和不能成为争取社会主义的最重要的武器。论文指出：南斯拉夫民族阵线在南斯拉夫人民反法西斯匪帮进行解放战争时期中，无疑曾起了很大的作用，并且毫无疑义的，民族阵线在现时也能够和应该成为国内一切民主力量合作的重要工具。可是，民族阵线不能代替共产党，而且他只有在共产党领导之下，才能起自己的相当作用。论文严厉批评南斯拉夫共产党现在领导机关的机会主义路线，指出它使南斯拉夫共产党逐渐丧失其成为独立的政治力量。沙尔盘奇耶写道：消灭党内的恐怖制度，铲除对党组织及其活动的官僚主义，使党完全公开存在，健全党的生活，经常召开党的大会和代表会议，发展党员积极的独立的创造工作，开展党内民主，发展批评和自我批评，这就是现时实际生活向南斯拉夫共产党提出的首要任务。作者最后写道：可以无容怀疑：有己光荣战斗传统的南斯拉夫共产党，能够找到充分力量来铲除党内现存的恐怖制度，消灭南斯拉夫共产党现在领导机关的不正确的路线——离开马克思主义、列宁主义的路线，能够在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大旗帜下，在其他国家共产党的支持下，引导南斯拉夫劳动群众为社会主义胜利而奋斗。"

    "content": "Explaining Policies to Solve Difficulties\n    Checking and Eliminating Wasteland in Various Parts of Southern Hebei\n    [Southern Hebei News] According to statistics from some villages in Yongzhi, Xiazhen, Jingxian, and Yuanchao counties, there are a total of 29,680 mu of green and white wasteland. The reasons for the wasteland are roughly as follows: (1) Many villages have not distributed the land cleared during the land reform in a timely and reasonable manner. In villages where land has been distributed, many small pieces of land or alkaline depressions remain. Some people are unwilling to cultivate the land because it is poor, thus leaving the land uncultivated. (2) The land of some landlords and rich peasants has not been distributed, and the instruction of \"whoever cultivates it, harvests it\" has not been earnestly implemented. They are taking a wait-and-see attitude and are not actively engaged in production. Landlords and rich peasants who have been thoroughly liquidated face production difficulties, which have not been properly resolved in a timely manner, and therefore cannot cultivate the land well even if they have it. (3) For the land of elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled individuals, as well as the families of military personnel, workers, and martyrs who lack labor, necessary substitute farming or assistance has not been provided in some cases. (4) The land of famine refugees, or the land reserved for them, has not been distributed to farmers for cultivation in accordance with the principle of \"whoever cultivates it, harvests it.\" Wasteland is also caused by enemy disasters and natural disasters. (5) There is bureaucracy among leaders who thought the masses would produce on their own, relaxing organizational leadership and failing to promptly detect and effectively address various problems in production. After discovering this problem, the leading organs in various regions have now begun to check and eliminate wasteland. According to incomplete statistics from Chengci, Yongzhi, and Linzhang counties, 5,000 mu of wasteland have been eliminated and seedlings have been planted. Yongzhi's third and fifth districts have adopted three methods for eliminating wasteland: (1) After group discussions among the masses, it was proposed that \"whoever is willing to cultivate it, whoever can cultivate it, should cultivate it.\" It was determined that land ownership would remain with the original owner, but in order to rush planting and prevent wasteland, it was stipulated that those with more labor should cultivate more land. Using this method, more than 3 qing of wasteland were distributed in two days. (2) Some villages with fewer livestock divided the wasteland among the farmers' association's groups for collective cultivation and harvesting. Twelve-li Village had a total of 38 mu of wasteland, which was divided and cultivated by the thirtieth group. (3) For individual villages with a large amount of wasteland and difficulty in reclaiming it, the land was collectively cultivated by the farmers' association. The Farmers' Association has collectively reclaimed 30 mu of wasteland in Zhao Fang Village, which had 90 mu of wasteland. The Gucheng County Committee proposed conducting a village-by-village and household-by-household inspection of wasteland, mobilizing the masses to help wasteland households cultivate land through mutual aid and exchange of labor, or using leasing and sub-planting methods to solve the difficulties in eliminating wasteland. The Wuben Village of the sixth district of Linzhang County stipulated methods for eliminating wasteland, mutual assistance, and exchanging land at the meetings of the Farmers' Association members and organization: If you plow one mu of land for me, I will weed two mu of seedlings for you; for plowing wasteland for the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled, the livestock providing households will receive all the grass for the year (the method of equivalent exchange of labor should be determined voluntarily by both parties, and it is inappropriate for the Farmers' Association members and group leaders alone to decide – Editor). In order to quickly and thoroughly eliminate wasteland, the Southern Hebei Daily published a short commentary based on the above situation, calling on \"Earnestly Check and Eliminate Wasteland!\" It pointed out that it is not too late to sow before the hot weather arrives, and all regions should earnestly check and eliminate wasteland. All land cleared during the land reform that has not yet been distributed should be distributed quickly, fairly, and reasonably. The land reserved for famine refugees should be distributed to farmers for cultivation according to the principle of only paying the burden and not the rental price. With the approval of the district, the burden on sandy alkaline land can be reduced or waived. The policy of \"no burden for one year of cultivated wasteland, no burden for three years of raw wasteland, and no inclusion of raw wasteland in equal distribution and supplementary allocation\" should be widely publicized to eliminate ideological obstacles among the masses. Village cadres and Party members should take the lead in production and implement exchange of labor and mutual assistance under the principles of voluntary association and equivalent exchange to solve the difficulties of labor and livestock. Appropriate care should be given to the families of military personnel, workers, martyrs, and poor elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled. Mobilize, persuade, and compel landlords and lazy people to participate in labor.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 说明政策解决困难　冀南各地查荒灭荒\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　说明政策解决困难\n    冀南各地查荒灭荒\n    【冀南讯】据永智、夏津、景县、元朝等县一部分村庄统计，共有青、白荒地二万九千六百八十亩。荒地原因大约有以下几个：（一）不少村庄清算出的土地未及时合理分配，已经分配的村庄，也剩下许多小块地或硷洼地，有些人嫌地坏不愿种，因而把地荒了。（二）有些地主富农土地，未被分配，亦未认真执行“谁种谁收”指示，而心从观望，不积极生产。已彻底清算的地主富农，因生产有困难，未及时适当解决，有地也不能好好耕种。（三）对缺乏劳力的老弱孤寡及军、工、烈属的地，有的没有进行必要的代耕或帮助。（四）逃荒户的土地，或给逃荒户保留的土地，没有按照“谁种谁收”的原则，分配给农民耕种。也有是因为敌灾、天灾而荒的。（五）领导上存在着官僚作风，以为群众自己会生产，而放松了组织领导，对生产中的各种问题，没有及时发觉和有效的处理。各地领导机关发觉了这个问题后，现已开始着手进行查荒灭荒。据成磁、永智、临漳等县不完全统计，已消灭荒地五千亩，并种上苗。永智三、五区灭荒采取三种方法：（１）经群众分组讨论，提出“谁愿种谁能种谁就种”，确定地权仍归原主，但为了抢种不荒地，规定按劳力多的多种。用这种方法，在两天内分配荒地三顷多。（２）有的村牲口少，便把荒地分到农会各小组伙种伙收。十二里屯共有荒地三十八亩，由第三十组分种起来。（３）个别荒地多而开荒困难的村子，就归农会集体耕种。赵坊村九十亩荒地，农会已集体开荒三十亩。故城县委会提出挨村挨户进行查荒，发动群众以互助换工帮助荒地户种地，或用出租分种的办法，解决灭荒困难。临漳六区务本村在农会委员、组织会议上，定出灭荒互助换地办法，你给我犁一亩地，我给你锄二亩苗；给老弱孤寡犁荒地，出牲口户得全年的草（应由双方自愿定出等价换工办法，光是农会委员和小组长决定不妥当——编者）。为迅速彻底消灭荒地，冀南日报特根据上述情况发表短论，号召“认真查荒灭荒！”指出：伏天未到，播种尚不为晚，各地应认真检查与消灭荒地。凡清算出来尚未分配的土地，应迅速公平合理的分配。给逃荒户留的土地，应按照只交负担，不出租价的原则，有计划的分给农民耕种。沙硷地经区批准可减少负担或不负担。并应普遍宣传“开熟荒一年不负担，生荒三年不负担，开生荒不在平分抽补之列”的政策，消除群众思想障碍。号召村干、党员带头生产，在自愿结合与等价交换的原则下，实行换工互助，以解决劳力畜力困难。对军工烈属及贫苦老弱孤寡，要给以适当照顾。动员说服与强制地主、懒汉参加劳动。"

The head of the 14th dam was washed away. The democratic government swiftly led the masses in emergency repairs. Before the project was completed, the head of the 13th dam was washed away on the 6th. The danger of a breach at the Gao Village project reached an extremely serious stage. All our river management staff, local government, and the masses worked day and night to intensify repairs. On July 7th, American-made Chiang planes suddenly appeared over the project and took turns bombing and strafing the workers. The workers and material transport personnel risked their lives, fought bravely, and persisted in their work. On the 9th, the entire 13th dam project was finally completed. On the 10th, the upper mouth of the 14th dam dropped another seven meters. Our river management staff and people along the river continued to repair despite the Chiang plane attacks. As of the morning of the 11th, 101 of our workers, material transport personnel, and residents of nearby villages had been killed or injured by Chiang planes. The emergency repair project was forced to stop on the 11th. The Gao Village project is in danger of breaching at any time. The local government is actively mobilizing the masses to continue repairs. If a breach occurs due to insufficient repairs, the Chiang bandits should be fully responsible for the monstrous crime of flooding the people along the river.\n    [Ji Lu Yu Telegram] The Gao Village project in Dongming is the largest dangerous project on the south bank of the Yellow River. When we recovered the area, the 7th dam had already lost its foundation, and the 10th dam was in danger. All the iron wire ropes had been cut by the Chiang bandits. The democratic government began to repair the dangerous project on June 19th, mobilizing 45,606 workers, 8,138 livestock, 302,244 jin of straw, and 267,700 bricks, repairing a total of nine dams, each raised one to one and a half meters above the water surface. The area had just been recovered, and everything was waiting to be done, with numerous difficulties. The democratic government overcame difficulties, led the masses, mobilized a large amount of manpower and materials, and completed the arduous task in just seven days. The personnel participating in the emergency repair project were very extensive. Old women in their sixties and seventies, and little girls in their teens also competed to participate. Cadres at all levels worked diligently day and night, rushing around to lead, and were self-disciplined and devoted to public service. Finally, they overcame various obstacles such as bombing and strafing by Chiang planes, and successfully completed this great project.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黄河如果决口蒋匪应负全责！  蒋机狂炸高村大险工  我抢修员工死伤百余工程被迫停止\n\n1948-07-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黄河如果决口蒋匪应负全责！\n    蒋机狂炸高村大险工\n    我抢修员工死伤百余工程被迫停止\n    【冀鲁豫电】东明高村抢险工程胜利竣工后，本月四日，河势突然发生变化，大溜下移，直冲十三、十四两坝。十四的镶头坝当被冲跑，民主政府火速领导群众紧急抢修，工程未完，十三坝的镶头坝复于六日被水冲跑。高村险工决口危险，至此乃达于极端严重阶段。我全体治河员工及当地政府、群众，昼夜不停加紧抢修。美制蒋机忽于七月七日窜抵险工上空，对抢险民工轮番轰炸扫射；抢险员工及运料群众冒生命危险，英勇奋斗，坚持工作，至九日卒使十三坝工程全部完成。十日，十四坝上口又掉蛰七公尺，我治河员工及沿河群众冒蒋机袭击，继续抢修；截至十一日晨，我抢险员工、运料民工及附近村庄群众，伤亡在蒋机轰炸扫射下者已达一百零一人。抢险工程，被迫于十一日停止。高村险工随时均有决口之虞。现当地政府正积极动员群众继续抢修，如因抢修不及而决口，则淹没沿河人民的滔天大罪，蒋匪应完全负责。\n    【冀鲁豫电】东明高村险工是黄河南岸第一大险工，我收复该地时，第七坝已掉垫，第十坝已出险，所有铁丝绳索都被蒋匪割光。民主政府于六月十九日领导群众开始抢修该处险工，动员民工四万五千六百零六人，牲口八千一百三十八头，秸料三○二二四四斤，砖料二六七七○○块，共抢修九个坝，每坝都修出水面一公尺到一公尺半。该地甫经收复，诸废待举，困难重重，民主政府排除困难，领导群众，动员广大人力物力，在短短的七天内即完成艰巨任务。参加抢修险工的人员非常广泛，六、七十岁的老太婆，十几岁的小女孩也争先恐后的参加。各级干部更是昼夜辛勤，奔波领导，克己奉公。终于排除蒋机轰炸扫射等各种阻挠，胜利完成此伟大工程。"

    "content": "The Battle of Beiying Village\n\nOn June 21st, after the entire 72nd Division of Yan Xishan's \"Personally Trained Division\" was annihilated by the People's Liberation Army between Pingyao and Jiexiu, the Yan bandit 19th Army headquarters, the 40th Division headquarters and its entire 2nd Regiment, and two companies of the 3rd Regiment, stationed in Pingyao, fearing annihilation by our forces, hurriedly departed from Pingyao and fled towards Qixian along the west side of the Tongpu Railway in three columns. However, as they entered the area seven miles northwest of Hongshan Station, they were fiercely intercepted by a unit of our People's Liberation Army, which quickly drove a wedge into the ranks of the Yan bandits. The Yan bandit ranks were thrown into chaos and turned to flee west. We immediately pursued them closely, and with the exception of a small number of enemies who escaped at the front and rear, the main force of the enemy, more than 3,000 men, was completely compressed and surrounded in Beiying Village. At dawn on the 24th, our army launched a general offensive against the surrounded enemy. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, our assault team first broke into the village from the southeast corner. The \"Zhao Shiping Class,\" which had made great contributions in the Linfen Campaign and won the glorious title, discovered that the enemy was fleeing north as they rushed to the edge of the village. They quickly charged towards the enemy, scattering them in all directions, capturing over a hundred enemies including a company commander. Liu Qinhe, a newly liberated soldier of a certain unit, whose rifle was broken, threw a grenade into a pile of enemies, instantly killing five and wounding more than ten. He then fired five shots in succession with a captured rifle, killing six more enemies. The remaining enemies prostrated themselves and begged for mercy, laying down their weapons.\n\nThe enemy within the village, under the bombardment of our artillery fire and the heroic assaults of our assault teams, suffered heavy casualties and had long since collapsed. A group of enemies broke out of the village to the southwest, but were met head-on by our ambushing troops as soon as they left the village, and had to retreat back into the village. At this time, most of the houses in the village had been occupied by our forces. A group of enemies poured out of the village and fled west. Zhao Yuzhen, a newly liberated soldier of a certain unit of our army, set up a short, thick infantry gun and aimed at the fleeing enemy, firing seven rounds in succession, each round landing in the midst of the chaotic enemy ranks. Forty or fifty enemies were seen lying on the ground in disorder. Our light and heavy machine guns also opened fire at the same time, and no matter how fast the enemy ran, they could not escape the pursuit of our bullets. Countless enemies died for Yan Xishan, the bloodsucker of the people of Shanxi, in the wheat fields, on the roads, and by the ridges.\n\nFollowing this, our infantry assault teams closely pursued them. The panicked enemies completely lost their combat effectiveness. Niu Longxi, the squad leader of the sixth squad of a certain unit of our army, saw the enemy dragging a mountain gun during the pursuit. Having run out of grenades and overheated his gun barrel, he temporarily picked up a clod of earth and threw it at the enemy. The panicked enemy immediately lay on the ground, not daring to move. Niu Longxi thus captured a mountain gun. Finally, the Yan bandits who were fortunate enough not to be killed by our firepower were all taken prisoner. At approximately 9:00 AM, the battle was completely resolved.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北营村歼灭战\n\n1948-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北营村歼灭战\n    六月二十一日，阎匪“亲训师”七十二师，在平遥、介休间被解放军全部歼灭后，盘踞平遥之阎匪十九军军部，四十师师部及其二团全部、三团两个连，深恐被我歼灭，慌忙由平遥出发，分三路纵队沿同蒲路西侧向祁县方面逃窜。但当进入洪善车站西北七里地区时，即遭我解放军某部猛烈钳击，迅速楔入阎匪行列。阎匪行列大乱，扭头西逃。我即跟踪猛追，除前后两头之敌逃脱一小部外，敌之主力三千余人，全部被我压缩包围于北营村内。二十四日拂晓，我军对被包围之敌发起总攻，在猛烈的炮火掩护下，我突击队首先从村东南角突入村内。在临汾战役中立过大功，获得光荣称号之“赵世平班”突进村边时，发现敌人向北逃窜，他们即迅速向敌人冲去，一下就把敌人打得七零八散，俘敌连长以下百余人。某部新解放战士刘秦河，他的步枪打坏了，就用一个炸弹向一伙敌人堆里扔过去，当场炸死敌五名，伤十余名，跟着他又用缴获的步枪连发五枪，打死敌人六名。其余敌人纷纷叩头求饶，放下武器。\n    村内敌人在我炮火轰击与突击队英勇冲杀下，死伤惨重，早已溃不成军。一股敌人向村西南突围逃跑，刚出村，又遭我预伏部队迎头痛击，只好又缩回村内。此时村内房屋已大部为我占领，一股敌人拥出村庄向西逃窜，我某部新解放战士赵玉珍，架起又短又粗的步重炮，瞄准逃跑的敌人连发七弹，弹弹落在混乱的敌人堆里，眼看着四五十个敌人横七竖八的倒在地上。我轻重机枪也于此时一齐开火，敌人跑得再快也跑不出我们的子弹的追击。数不清的敌人就在我军猛烈的火力下，为山西人民的吸血鬼阎锡山冤死在麦田里、大路上、地坎边。\n    接着，我步兵突击队就紧紧追赶上去。惊慌的敌人完全失掉战斗力。我某部六班长牛龙喜在追击中，看见敌人拖着一门山炮。他的炸弹打完了，枪筒打热了，就临时捡起一块土圪＠向敌人投去。惊慌的敌人赶紧爬在地下不敢动。牛龙喜就这样缴了一门山炮。最后，侥幸未被我火力杀伤的阎匪，全部当了俘虏。约九时许，即全部解决了战斗。"

    "content": "Resolutely Protect Industry and Commerce\n    Changzhi City Returns Yi Ji Pharmacy\n    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Yi Ji Pharmacy in Changzhi has been in operation for over fifty years, with capital exceeding 20 million (Ji banknotes), making it one of the larger industrial and commercial enterprises in Changzhi City. During the \"investigation and squeezing\" campaign last July, rural struggle methods were mistakenly applied, and Yi Ji Pharmacy was also subjected to struggle. It was then transformed into the \"Workers and Citizens Pharmacy,\" a cooperative production venture.\n\n    After studying the city policies and the industrial and commercial policies, the work team resolutely corrected the deviation. Initially, the proposal to return Yi Ji Pharmacy met with resistance from some cadres and activists who had participated in the struggle, as well as workers and shop assistants who had received shares. They argued, \"We dared to struggle because the higher authorities told us to. If the higher authorities tell us to return it, then we will return it.\" Addressing this mindset, the leadership first offered self-criticism, explaining that they had failed to distinguish between feudalism and capitalism in the past and did not understand the Party's industrial and commercial policies, resulting in the wrong struggle last year. They emphasized that now that they understood the policies, they should resolutely correct the mistake. Subsequently, through meetings and individual talks, they repeatedly conducted policy and ideological education, enlightening everyone about the benefits of developing industry and commerce for their own personal interests. At this point, correct and positive opinions emerged among the masses. Some said, \"Returning it is the right thing to do. If it's not returned, no one will dare to develop. The more industry and commerce develops in Changzhi City, the more benefits we workers and shop assistants will have.\" The leadership paid attention to guiding and elevating this thinking, linking the Party's policies with the people's immediate interests. Most people gradually came to understand. Xu Qihuai, an activist in the struggle who initially resisted the return, said, \"I am a blacksmith worker. If Yi Ji is returned, other businesses will dare to develop, which will also benefit me as a blacksmith.\" With the masses' thinking straightened out, the return process began, totaling more than 26.8 million. Seeing that Yi Ji Pharmacy was genuinely being returned, the masses in the city said, \"If Yi Ji, worth over 20 million, is being returned to its original owner, what are we afraid of with our small businesses!\" Many people dug out silver dollars and assets to expand their businesses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 坚决保护工商业　长治市退还义记药房\n\n1948-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　坚决保护工商业\n    长治市退还义记药房\n    【本报讯】长治义记药房有五十多年的经营历史，资本达两千万以上（冀钞），为长市较大工商业之一。去年七月查挤运动时，错误的搬用了农村的斗争方式，把义记药房也斗了。改为群众合作生产的“职工市民药房”。\n    工作组学习城市政策及工商业政策后，即坚决纠偏。最初提出要退还义记药房，有些过去斗争中的干部积极分子及分了股的工人店员想不通，说：“斗是上级叫斗，俺才敢斗，退也是上级叫退，退吧。”领导上针对着这种思想，首先作自我批评，说明过去没有把封建与资本界限分开，不懂得党的工商业政策，于去年斗争错了；今天了解了政策，就该坚决纠正。接着以会议及个别谈话等形式，反复进行政策思想教育，启发大家认识发展工商业对自己的切身利益。这时群众中产生了正确、积极的意见，有人说：“退是对的，不退谁也不敢发展。长治市工商业发展大了多了，咱们工人店员用的也多了”。领导上注意诱导提高这种思想，使党的政策和群众的切身利益连系起来。大部分人慢慢想通了。曾经不愿退的斗争中积极分子徐起怀说：“我是个铁匠工人，把义记退还了，别的买卖都敢发展，对我这铁匠也有好处。”群众思想打通，即着手退还，总共退还二千六百八十余万元。市内群众看见真的退还了义记药房，都说：“义记两千多万还退给原主了，何况这小买卖，怕甚哩”！许多人都刨出银洋、资财扩展营业了。"

The people of Caocun village complained that they were not living like human beings, and could be killed at any time. Cao Baoyu from his village went to Pingyao city to buy medicine for his sick mother. He was checked by the Yan bandits, and because he did not have the three certificates (namely, a travel permit, a national ID card, and a unified organization certificate), he was brutally murdered. Later, his younger brother, Xiao Bao, went to claim the body, and was falsely accused of scouting for information and detained as a conscript. His mother died of grief, and his father hanged himself.

A folk song is popular in the area: \"Yan Xishan is a killing fiend, making it impossible for the people to live, making women without men.\" The puppet county government robbed 150 shi of wheat from Jia Village, and the people complained bitterly. The puppet government said, \"We will no longer ask Jia Village for grain.\" Then the \"Love the Homeland Corps\" and \"Security Police Team\" came to demand grain, grass, fodder, and flour. What they took was never enough to satisfy them. Once, when the enemy came to demand grain, villager Zhao Shili was in the vegetable garden.

This demonstrated the high level of political consciousness and the spirit of hard struggle of the people in the liberated areas. In addition to completing the logistical tasks at the front lines, they also helped the masses in the border areas with weeding and harvesting during lulls in the fighting.

Farmer Zhang Niuxiao, who was helped, said, \"We are truly all one family under heaven.\" In completing the logistical tasks, the civilian laborers were even more brave and determined, and many heroes and role models have emerged. The first batch of civilian laborers from Xiangyuan had just returned from participating in the Linfen campaign, and the second batch went to Jinzhong. Civilian labor cadres Su Zhagou and Zhao Haiman voluntarily carried 50 jin of grain, influencing other civilian laborers to also carry more. During breaks, the civilian laborers also carried water and helped with work for the masses, publicizing various policies of the liberated areas. Many people were commended and awarded in the merit-awarding movement. When the civilian laborers set out, weeding and the summer harvest were in full swing. The villages fully organized the semi-able-bodied labor force to complete the farm work on time, eliminating the family concerns of the participating civilian laborers and directly ensuring the successful completion of the participation task. In Heiyan Village, Qi District, Zuoquan, 40 male laborers participated in the war, and 123 women, children, and elderly men in the village participated in weeding and harvesting, undertaking the same glorious major production task as the young and strong who went to the front to participate in the war. In seven days, they weeded all 1,563 mu of seedlings in the entire village. They wrote to the participants, saying: \"The seedlings in our village have all been weeded. We hope you don't worry and focus on cooperating with the army to fight Yan Xishan.\" In Shimen and Shangbeizhang in the Second District of Wuxiang, and Podi and other villages in the Sixth District, they all first did the work for the participating civilian laborers. When the civilian laborers in Podi Village set out, they mutually guaranteed to do the work in their fields well. The civilian laborers guaranteed not to desert, not to violate mass discipline, and to obey orders.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 打到太原去，活捉阎锡山！　太行群众踊跃参战\n\n1948-07-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　打到太原去，活捉阎锡山！\n    太行群众踊跃参战\n    【太行电】“打到太原去，活捉阎锡山”。太行二分区及一分区十数县广大群众在此次晋中战役中，自动组织起来，担负担架、运输、救护等工作，热情帮助解放军，表现了解放区人民高度的政治觉悟与艰苦奋斗精神。他们除完成前线的战勤任务外，并在战争空隙帮助边地群众锄苗抢收。昔阳担架一营一连于六月二十一日到达许村，一夜即为群众割麦五十一亩。二、四、五连亦在驻村帮助群众锄苗，得到边地群众热情拥护，密切了前后方群众的关系。被帮助的农民张牛小说：“真是天下农民一家人了。”在完成战勤任务上，民工们更是勇敢坚决，现已涌现出许多英雄模范。襄垣第一批民工由临汾参战归来不久，第二批又到了晋中。民工干部粟扎苟、赵海蛮自动扛粮五十斤，影响其他民工也自动多扛。在休息时间，民工们还给群众担水帮工，宣传解放区各种政策。在评功记功运动中，许多人都立了功。民工出发时，锄苗夏收正忙，村里充分组织半辅劳力，按时作完农活，消除了参战民工的家庭顾虑，直接保证了参战任务的胜利完成。左权七区壑岩村有四十个男劳力参战，全村妇女儿童老汉一百二十三人参加锄苗割麦，担负起与青壮年到前方参战同等光荣的大生产任务。七天时间就把全村一千五百六十三亩小苗全部锄完。她们给参战的人写信说：“咱村苗已全部锄完，希望你们不要挂念，安心配合军队打阎锡山。”武乡二区石门、上北漳，六区坡底等村，都是先给参战的民工做活。坡底村群众在参战民工出发时，互相保证把他们地里活做好，民工们保证不开小差、不违犯群众纪律、服从指挥。"

It closed down in May of this year, and the workers lost their jobs. Worker Li Qinglian was unwilling to let the factory continue to collapse, so he and the board of directors studied and reviewed the reasons for the previous failure: (1) The distribution of employees was unreasonable. Out of a total of twelve people, four were staff members, five were apprentices, and only three were technical workers. There were too many people detached from production, and expenses were high. Wages, food, and miscellaneous expenses accounted for half of the cost. (2) Out of a total capital of 2.5 million yuan, furniture accounted for half. Especially in the summer, the sales of finished products were not good, and the funds became stagnant and could not be turned over. (3) The factory's general manager and deputy manager both held concurrent positions (the general manager was the manager of Shenyuanhao Grocery Store, and the deputy manager was the director of the Citizens' Association), and they did their duties for free. They were unwilling in their hearts and felt it was delaying their own business. Sometimes, when citizens made suggestions to them, they could not accept them, and their emotions became even more depressed, and they just wanted to withdraw their heads to do their own business. In response to the above shortcomings, it was decided to reorganize and open again based on the principle of benefiting both labor and management. The entire factory was reduced to six people, with Li Qinglian as the manager, one accountant, two technical workers, and two apprentices. Three machines were opened, and outside workers were used when busy. This could reduce expenses by half. Worker Lao He said, \"This time, there is not a single idle person in the entire factory, and the manager also participates in labor. This time, making money is a certainty!\" (Dian Chen)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 改善经营方法利群工厂复业\n殿臣\n1948-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　改善经营方法利群工厂复业\n    【冀南讯】邯郸南关街利群织工厂，从去年八月成立，一直没有赚钱，到今年五月关了门，工人也失了业。工人李青莲不愿让工厂一直垮下去，就和董事会研究检讨了以前垮台的原因：（一）职工分配不合理，一共十二人，光职员就占四人，学徒五人，技术工人只有三人，脱离生产的人多、开支大，光工资伙食杂花等开支就占成本一半。（二）一共二百五十万元本钱、家具就占一半，特别到了夏季，成品销路不广，资金成了死的，周转不开。（三）工厂正副经理都是兼差（正经理是慎源号杂货铺的经理，副总理是市民会主任），白尽义务，心里不愿意，嫌耽误自己生意。有时市民对他们提些意见，接受不了，情绪更加低落，光想抽了头去作自己的买卖。针对着上面缺点，就决定本着劳两利的办法，重新组织开张，全厂减为六人，由李青莲任经理，会计一人，技术工人二人，学徒二人，开三台机，忙时用外工，这样可以减去一半开支。工人老贺说：“这回全厂没有一个闲人，经理也参加劳动，这下赚钱说啥！”（殿臣）"

    "content": "(Taihang Electric) Since the Xu Corps of our North China Field Army launched a powerful offensive against the Chiang army in Jinzhong, the Chiang-Yan bandits have been extremely panicked. Yan bandits in Taiyuan, Yuci, Taigu, and other places along the Tongpu Railway are everywhere forcibly seizing residents to build fortifications. Inside and outside Taiyuan city, organizations and schools, both male and female students, are being forced into service. The Taiyuan Yan Bandit's \"People's Daily\" successively published editorials, exclaiming, \"Urgently defend Jinzhong.\" The Taiyuan Yan bandits are implementing strict inspections of merchants entering the city, who must have a guarantor personally holding a letter of guarantee, which must be inspected and stamped by the police station in the residence and at the city gate before they can enter the city. The Yan Bandit \"People's Defense Army\" held a mobilization meeting in the People's Park under the pretext of \"Defending Taiyuan,\" and forcibly ordered women in the city to carry out \"training\" with guns. Merchants in Yuci Chengguan were also forced to undergo \"collective training.\" The Taiyuan Waterworks Bureau began restricting water use as early as June 5th. The Northwest Industrial Construction Company's Electricity Department issued regulations restricting the use of electric lights: all public and private business door lights, horizontal signboard lights, window display lights, office buildings of organizations, and civilian lights were placed under control without exception. To prepare for Taiyuan being besieged, the Yan bandits forcibly ordered merchants and residents in the city to merge their residences, demolish houses, and rush to repair the airport inside the city. According to the People's Daily, the Yan bandits personally issued a handwritten order stating: \"If anyone only seeks personal convenience and disregards overall safety, and intentionally fails to merge when they should, they should be struggled against, and the military police and constitution should assist the housing management committee in enforcing it.\" Taiyuan City presents a scene of chaos. After our army recovered Qixian County, prices rose several times a day. According to Luo Jinlin, a merchant from Taiyuan, in late June, white flour was selling for 320,000 to 330,000 yuan per catty, and millet for 370,000 to 380,000 yuan. A sesame seed cake weighing only one tael has risen from 30,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan each. Food is extremely scarce, and the people's lives are extremely difficult, hoping for our army to liberate Taiyuan like a great drought hoping for rain.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋中我军强大攻势下　太原阎匪极度恐慌\n\n1948-07-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋中我军强大攻势下\n    太原阎匪极度恐慌\n    【太行电】自我华北野战军徐兵团向晋中蒋军强大攻势展开后，蒋阎匪恐慌异常。同蒲沿线太原、榆次、太谷等地阎匪，到处强抓居民加修工事。太原市内外机关团体及学校男女学生，均被迫征用。阎匪太原民众日报先后发表社论，惊呼：“紧急保卫晋中”。太原阎匪对入城商民实行严格检查，必须由保人亲持保证书，到驻地及城门口警察派出所检验后，加盖戳记，始得进城。该市阎匪“民卫军”曾假民众公园举行“保卫太原”的动员大会，并强令市内妇女实行持枪“训练”。榆次城关商贩亦被迫“集训”。太原自来水管理局，早于六月五日起，即限制用水。西北实业建设公司电业处颁发电灯限制使用办法：凡公私商号门灯、横式招牌灯、窗橱灯、机关团体办公处及市民用灯，均毫无例外置于管制之列。为防备太原被困，阎匪更强令城内商民合并居住，拆毁民房，赶修城内飞机场。据民众日报载：阎匪曾亲颁手令称：“如有只图个人便利，不顾整体安危，该合并而故意不合并者，应予斗争，由军警宪协助房管会强制执行。”太原市呈现一片混乱。我军收复祁县后，物价更一日数涨。据来自太原的商民罗锦林谈：六月下旬，白面每斤已卖到三十二、三万元，小米三十七、八万元。重仅一两的烧饼，每个已由三万元涨到五万元。食粮奇缺，市民生活极度困难，祈盼我军解放太原如大旱望雨。"

Yan's bandits in Taiyuan have been completely isolated, and their final annihilation is just around the corner. Our army's important victories in the past few days are as follows:\n\n(1) The headquarters of Yan's 34th Army and its subordinate 73rd Division, Provisional 44th Division, and part of the 10th Column, were completely annihilated by our army after three days and nights of fierce fighting on the 12th in the Dachangzhen and Nanzhuang area southeast of Xugou. The headquarters of Yan's 33rd Army and its subordinate 71st Division, Provisional 46th Division, and the remaining part of the 10th Column, have been surrounded by our army in the Xiaochang and Xifancun area southeast of Xugou and are being annihilated.\n\n(2) Yan's 9th Column in Taigu fled towards Yuci on the 12th, but were surrounded by us in the Jiacun area northeast of Taigu.

The 33rd Army headquarters, 71st Division, Provisional 46th Division, 68th Division, three divisions and half a column are still being encircled and annihilated. Yan's bandits have a total of five army headquarters, all of which have now been annihilated or are being annihilated; they have a total of fifteen divisions and three columns. In addition to the above-mentioned ten divisions and two columns that have been annihilated or are being annihilated, their 66th Division was annihilated in Linfen in May, and the Provisional 49th Division also suffered a devastating blow in Shouyang in May. The Provisional 45th Division, which fled from Xugou to the vicinity of Taiyuan, has only two regiments left (another regiment was annihilated southwest of Qingyuan this time), and the Provisional 39th Division in Xinxian has suffered repeated losses. Including the Provisional 38th Division that is about to be left in Datong, Yan's bandits now only have about three divisions and one column left. Yan's bandits originally controlled fifteen county towns in Jinzhong, and now they are only besieged in the four cities of Taiyuan Provincial Capital (Yangqu), Taiyuan County Town (renamed Jinyuan), Yuci, and Xinxian.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, 17th: According to Tianjin newspapers, at the end of last month, a violent incident occurred in Beiping where Kuomintang troops and police obstructed a student petition, assaulting and arresting students, which has provoked joint protests from students at seven universities in Beiping. Over a thousand students from Beiping Teachers College, in order to demand that Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education fulfill its promise to allow the college to be restored to university status, set off for Nanjing on the morning of June 29th to petition. They were driven back to the college by police, pre-arranged by the Chiang government, and eleven students were injured by thrown stones. A student from the Journalism Department of Yenching University, who entered the college to report on the incident, was also arrested. The student unions of Beiping University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Chaoyang University, and other seven universities jointly issued a declaration on June 30th, protesting the persecution by the Chiang government and expressing full support for the Teachers College's \"Restore University Movement.\"\n\nIt is reported that the predecessor of Beiping Teachers College was Beiping Normal University, which was the highest normal education institution in the country before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1937, the university moved to southern Shaanxi due to the war. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education reduced the scale of the university and renamed it Teachers College. The following year, it was renamed Northwest Teachers College and moved to Lanzhou. After the Japanese surrender, the Chiang government attempted to abolish the university, but after the students and faculty of the college strongly protested, it was forced to establish Beiping Teachers College in Beiping to accommodate the returning faculty and students. Last year, during the student movement against hunger and civil war in the Chiang-controlled areas in May and June, the students of the college put forward the demand for \"restoring the university.\" Zhu Jiahua, then Minister of Education of Chiang Kai-shek, promised in Beiping at the time that the college would be allowed to restore its university status after one year, and that the college would first establish three departments: Literature, Science, and Education (according to the Chiang government's \"University Law,\" only institutions with three or more colleges can be called a university, otherwise they can only be called independent colleges). Now the college has completed the establishment of the university on schedule, but Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Education has broken its promise and delayed its recognition. Yuan Dunli, the president of the college, has been negotiating in Nanjing for more than two months without any results. The students of the college therefore began a strike on June 20th and decided to go to Nanjing to petition.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: After the Chiang and Fu bandit gangs created the \"July 5th Massacre\" in Beiping, they surrounded various schools for days, arbitrarily beating and threatening teachers and students. According to continuous reports from the Associated Press, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Yenching University have been surrounded by police and \"anti-communist vanguards,\" groups recognized by students as official puppets, since the 12th. All pedestrians entering and leaving were subjected to unreasonable inspections. On the same day, two Yenching University students and a Tsinghua University student and a physical education teacher were beaten while riding bicycles out of Tsinghua. On the 13th, five or six hundred \"anti-communist vanguards\" broke into Tsinghua University and wantonly made trouble for several hours before leaving. The students of the university have asked President Mei Yiqi to take steps to protect the safety of teachers and students.\n\nAccording to a dispatch from the Associated Press in Beiping: The Northeast Students' Federation issued a written statement on the 12th, condemning the Central News Agency for spreading rumors. It stated that it was \"extremely angry\" at the Central News Agency's Beiping dispatch on the 9th, which falsely claimed in the name of Northeast student representatives that the thousands of Northeast students who participated in the July 9th anti-slaughter demonstration \"had no intention of participating in the parade,\" and denounced it as a conspiracy to split student unity, and stated that it would file a lawsuit against it.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪军警殴捕师院请愿学生　平七校学生愤激抗议  东北学生联合会斥责中央社造谣\n\n1948-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪军警殴捕师院请愿学生\n    平七校学生愤激抗议\n    东北学生联合会斥责中央社造谣\n    【新华社华北十七日电】据天津报纸消息：上月底北平曾发生国民党军警阻挠学生请愿殴捕学生的暴行，并已激起平市七校学生联合抗议。缘北平师范学院学生千余人，为要求蒋记教育部实践诺言，允许该院恢复为大学建制，乃于六月二十九日晨出发前往南京请愿，被蒋政府预先布置的警察驱回校内，并以石子击伤学生十一人。燕大新闻系学生一人进入该院采访，亦横遭逮捕。平市北大、清华、燕京、朝阳等七校学生自治会为此于六月三十日联合发表宣言，抗议蒋政府迫害，并表示全力支援师院“复大运动”。\n    按：北平师院前身为北平师范大学，系抗战前全国最高师范教育机构。一九三七年该校因战事迁陕南，三八年蒋记教育部缩小该校规模，并改名为师范学院，次年又改称为西北师范学院迁往兰州。日本投降后，蒋政府企图取消该大学，后在该院师生力争下，始被迫在平设立北平师院，收容该校返平师生。去年五六月间蒋区学生掀起反饥饿、反内战运动时，该校学生提出“复大”要求，蒋记教育部长朱家骅当时在平答应一年后准予该校复大，先由该院成立文学、理学、教育三部（按蒋政府“大学法”规定，具备三个学院以上者始得称为大学，否则仅得称为独立学院）。现该院已按期完成大学建制，而蒋记教育部竟自食诺言，拖延不予承认，该院院长袁敦礼为此在南京交涉两月余亦无结果。该校学生因此于六月二十日开始罢课，并决定赴南京请愿。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋、傅匪帮在北平制造“七、五惨案”后，复连日包围各校随意殴打、威胁各校师生。据美联社连日报导：北大、清华、燕京三校校内，从十二日起即被警察及被学生公认为官方御用团体的“反共先锋队”所包围，一切行人出入均被无理检查。当日燕大学生二人，清华学生及体育教员各一人乘自行车出清华时即横遭殴打。十三日“反共先锋队”五、六百人竟冲入清华校内，肆意捣乱数小时始离去。该校学生已要求校长梅贻琦采取步骤保障师生安全。\n    另据美联社北平讯：东北学生联合会于十二日发表书面声明斥责中央社造谣，对中央社北平九日电中假冒东北学生代表名义诬蔑参加七·九反屠杀示威的数千东北学生“原无参加游行之意图”一节，表示“极为愤怒”，斥之为分裂学生团结的阴谋，并表示将对此提出诉讼。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th. A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army is conducting political study and ideological review. On the basis of raising the political consciousness of the soldiers, a movement to examine cadres, evaluate merits, and record demerits is also being carried out. At the beginning of the movement, the soldiers were afraid of losing face by revealing their bad thoughts. Therefore, the leading organs adopted the approach of first examining good examples and using these to educate the soldiers, raise their class consciousness, and then launch a general review. Wang Huiwa, a liberated soldier, was active and brave in the Jingwei battle. During the capture of Baoji, he did not even visit his brother, who had lived in the city for many years, in order to focus on his work. In analyzing his own thoughts, he said: \"I am a poor man. I suffered enough oppression in the Kuomintang. When I came to the People's Liberation Army, it was like finding a home. To help the poor people to turn over, it is only in difficult environments that we are truly serving the people.\" Among the good examples, the leading organs encouraged the soldiers to compare the good examples with their own thoughts and conduct self-examination. As a result, those with shortcomings requested to examine themselves first, and a general review naturally unfolded. In the general review, the examination of cadres, evaluation of merits, and recording of demerits were further carried out. Xue Yingcai, a combat hero of the Tenth Company, became arrogant and conceited after being promoted to platoon leader due to his own lack of political progress. He showed timidity and fear of death in the battle of @邑. After everyone exposed and criticized his mistakes, Xue sincerely accepted everyone's opinions and expressed his determination to atone for his sins by performing meritorious service in future battles. Li Zhensheng, the squad leader of the Fourth Squad of the Ninth Company, was demoted from platoon leader to squad leader last year due to weak fighting will during the \"three checks\" campaign. He then resolved to correct his mistakes. During pre-war training, he led the best ideological study performance. After that, he personally observed the terrain and selected firepower points in every battle. In one mission to resist the enemy, he used only 330 rounds of ammunition to complete the cover mission. In continuous combat marches, he set an example by doing extra public service and was very concerned about the lives of all the soldiers in the squad. Everyone unanimously believed that he had made great contributions and proposed that the higher authorities restore his original position. The higher authorities then restored his original position based on everyone's opinions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北某部进行查思想政治学习　有功的受到表扬有过的决心改过\n\n1948-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北某部进行查思想政治学习\n  　有功的受到表扬有过的决心改过\n    【新华社西北十六日电】西北解放军某部进行查思想的政治学习。并在战士提高政治觉悟的基础上，进行查干部评功记过运动。运动开始时，战士们怕讲出坏思想丢人。因此领导机关便采取先查好的典型，并由此教育战士，提高其阶级觉悟，再展开普查。解放战士王辉娃在泾渭战斗中积极勇敢；克宝鸡时，为了工作，连分别多年住在城里的哥哥都没有去探望一下。在分析他自己的思想时，他说：“我是穷人，在国民党里受压迫受够了，到了解放军，如同找到了家，为穷人翻身，在艰苦环境下才是真正替人民办事的时候。”查好的典型中，领导机关启发战士们将好的典型和自己的思想对比，进行检讨。于是有缺点的人都要求先查自己，因而很自然的展开了普查。在普查中进一步进行查干部评功记过。十连战斗英雄薛英才，自升为排长后，由于自己政治上不进步，便骄傲自大；在＠邑战斗中表现畏缩怕死。经大家对他的错误揭露并批评后，薛诚恳接受了大家意见，并表示决心在以后战斗中立功赎罪。九中队四班长李振声，去年三查因战斗意志薄弱，由排长降为班长后，即决心改正错误。战前练兵时，他领导的思想学习成绩最佳。以后每次战斗他都亲自观察地形，选择火力点。某次执行抗击任务时，只用了三百卅发子弹，完成了掩护任务。在连续战斗行军中，以身作则多出公差，并非常关心全班战士的生活。大家一致认为他功劳大，提议要求上级恢复他的原职。上级当根据大家意见恢复他的原职。"

In order to improve the commanding ability of cadres, the leaders of the 5th Detachment of this unit personally led a company in an exercise simulating a battle in a village on the plains, and selected company and platoon cadres from various battalions to observe. During the actual exercise, the 1st Company studied and discussed the assessment of the enemy's situation, reconnaissance of the terrain, the issuance of decisions, and the deployment of forces in segments. During the exercise, Li Chunchu, the company commander of the 1st Company, continued to attack the village after clearing the enemy's forward guard. He decided to eliminate the enemy guarding the village, ordering the 2nd and 3rd Platoons to attack the enemy from the left and right sides, and the 1st Platoon to serve as the second echelon, going to whichever side needed it depending on the situation. After everyone's discussion, it was determined that although the movement route on the left side had a stretch of open ground, it had trees, ridgelines, and earthen embankments that could be utilized, and it was easy to bypass the enemy's rear and surround them. Therefore, forces should be concentrated to attack from the left side; there was no need to keep an entire platoon in the rear, and only a small number of troops should be left on the right side to confuse and contain the enemy. Only in this way could the goal of completely annihilating the defending enemy be achieved; if the forces were dispersed to attack, at most the enemy could only be defeated.

Our Party has grown from a small group of dozens of people at the beginning to a national mass party with more than three million members today; our army has grown from a few thousand people in 1927 to tens of thousands in 1937 to millions now; the Liberated Areas have grown from tens of thousands of people in the past to more than 160 million people today. This shows that as long as it is in line with the truth, even if it seems small at first, it will become infinitely strong in no time.\" Deputy Commander Peng recalled the situation in the Northwest theater over the past sixteen months, saying: \"We have eliminated 116,000 enemy troops, changing the numerical ratio between the enemy and us from one to thirteen, to the point where the enemy does not have much more than us in number today. This is a major victory. Regionally speaking, in August and September of last year, all the county towns in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region had fallen into enemy hands one after another. Now, except for Qingyang, Dingbian, and other five cities still in enemy hands, not only has the entire Border Region been liberated, but dozens of new cities and vast new liberated areas have also been liberated. Hu Zongnan's capital is getting smaller and smaller. His recent clamoring about the 'Huanglong Mountain Area decisive battle,' etc., is just a bluff. If he really dares to come to the Huanglong Mountain Area, then his doomsday will come even faster.\" Deputy Commander Peng finally told everyone with excitement: The national victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution is not far off, and the day of attacking Xi'an and capturing Hu Zongnan alive is even closer. Faced with this favorable situation, all comrades of the Northwest Field Army must abandon personal plans and continue to work harder and fight better. He called for continuing to deepen the mass line rectification movement within the Party, examine and approve the large number of Party members and cadres recommended by the masses, so that new forces can grow continuously, and strive for the final victory of the people's revolutionary war to come sooner. Deputy Commander Peng's speech gave great encouragement to the soldiers and civilians present, and the entire venue shouted slogans such as \"Down with Hu Zongnan, liberate the Great Northwest!\" Finally, the Northwest Art Troupe performed the famous Northwest revolutionary historical drama \"Zhou Zishan,\" and the meeting did not end until late at night.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北野战军驻地纪念“七七”  彭副总司令发表讲演  号召全军作好工作打好仗争取胜利更早到来\n\n1948-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北野战军驻地纪念“七七”\n    彭副总司令发表讲演\n    号召全军作好工作打好仗争取胜利更早到来\n    【新华社西北十七日电】西北野战军与驻地民主政府及群众于七月七日联合举行盛大的“七七”抗战十一周年纪念大会。人民解放军副总司令兼西北野战军司令员彭德怀将军于会中发表讲演称：“八年抗战，没有中国共产党和八路军、新四军，日本帝国主义就打不出去，中国就会亡国！”他在简单叙述我党及我军的发展历史后，说：“二十七年的时间并不算长，但我们的力量是千百倍地增涨了。我党由开始时的几十个人的小组发展成为现在的三百万人以上的全国的群众性的大党；我们的军队由一九二七年的几千人到一九三七年的几万人发展到现在的几百万人；解放区由过去的几十万人发展到现在的一亿六千余万人。由此可见，只要是合乎真理的，那怕最初看来很小，但时间不会多久，就将无比壮大起来。”彭副总司令回述十六个月来的西北战局说：“我们消灭了敌人十一万六千人，使敌我在数量上由一与十三之比，达到今天敌人在数量上并不比我们多了多少，这是一件重大的胜利。就地区说，去年八、九月时，陕甘宁边区的所有县城，均曾先后沦陷敌手，现在除庆阳、定边等五城尚在敌手外，不仅全边区光复了，且解放了几十个新城市和广大新解放区。胡宗南的本钱是越来越小了，他前些时候吵叫什么‘黄龙山区大会战’等等，那仅是虚张声势而已。如果他真的敢来黄龙山区，那么他的末日就更快了。”彭副总司令最后满怀兴奋的告诉大家：中国人民民主革命的全国胜利，已为期不远，打到西安活捉胡宗南的日子已更迫近。面临这种有利形势，西北野战军全体同志们必须抛弃个人打算，继续努力把工作做得更好，把仗打得更好。他号召继续深入开展群众路线的整党运动，把群众推荐出来的大批党员、干部加以审查批准，使新的力量源源增长，争取人民革命战争的最后胜利更早到来。彭副总司令的讲演给到会军民以极大鼓舞，全场高呼“打倒胡宗南，解放大西北”等口号，末由西北文工团演出西北革命历史名剧“周子山”，直到深夜始散。"

Yicheng North Pass is a distribution center for goods traded between the mountainous areas of southern Shanxi and the plains, known as \"Yicheng Pass that can't be filled, Yicheng Pass that can't be carried away.\" The city's industry and commerce had long been devastated by the plundering and destruction of the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan. It is gradually recovering and developing after liberation. During the mass movement last autumn, 31 businesses were mistakenly struggled against (15 were struggled against by locals, and 16 were struggled against by masses from Fushan and Qinshui), affecting merchants' willingness to do business boldly, and many large shops became small stalls. Wang Meixuan separated his company name. Ren Shouyi said, \"Last winter, I only displayed a few flints and pigments, and I dared not sell yellow silk, let alone put it out. Someone said I was 'capable,' which scared me for days.\" The North Pass work team resolutely implemented the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce. On the 15th, they first returned Jia Liyan's mountain goods shop (worth more than 3 million Jicha), which was changed in name but not in substance. On the 16th, they returned the struggled items to Yongji Store and Dongxinglong Tobacco Shop. The merchants were all smiles when they saw the goods being carried back through the streets. They witnessed 54 barrels of pigments (worth more than 2.9 million yuan) being returned to Yongji and other stores. Zhang Mingrui said, \"In the past, I dared not put out my inventory, and I only dared to take out one or two dozen out of ten dozen towels, for fear that people would say I had too much; now I want to borrow goods from others to display, only fearing that there are too few goods to attract customers.\" Now the North Pass market has begun to be active, and the shelves of that store are full of various goods. Nineteen stores are repairing and building houses and tidying up their storefronts, and more than 30 public-owned commercial firms are clearing up organ production and transferring them to private operation according to instructions.

The factory was originally a small soap factory organized by several technicians, including Shang Ruke and Ping Menglin, with a total capital of 2,275,000 yuan (冀钞, Ji currency) and ten workers. In addition to making soap, they carefully selected high-quality raw materials and used scientific methods. After half a month of painstaking research, they produced glycerin, machine oil, gasoline, and kerosene on June 19th. The raw materials are agricultural products, and the cost is very low. They supply the needs of industry and the vast rural areas, and sales are wide. After testing, the quality is very good. Customers reflected: \"The kerosene is very clear, the lamp wick is very bright, there is no black smoke, and it can compare with American kerosene.\" Currently, one pot produces 100 jin per day, and there are plans to gradually expand to add five more pots and an oil press by the end of the year, which will further reduce costs. The government, to reward this kind of industrial creation, has issued loans to support and encourage its continued development.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长治华兴工厂试制煤油成功\n\n1948-07-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长治华兴工厂试制煤油成功\n    【太行讯】长治市华兴工厂以农产品试制甘油机器油及煤油、汽油，已获成功。该厂原来是尚如科、平孟林等几个技术工人组织的小型肥皂厂，集有资本二百二十七万五千元（冀钞），共有工人十人。除了制造肥皂外，并精选上等原料，用科学方法，经半月的苦心研究，在六月十九日制出甘油、机器油、汽油、煤油等四种产品。原料是农产物，成本甚低。供给工业与广大农村需用，销路很广。经过试验质量很好。顾客反映：“煤油汤很清，灯花很明亮，没黑烟，能比上美国煤油。”现在一口锅日产百斤，计划逐渐扩大，到年底增加五口锅和榨油机一架，当更能减低成本。政府为奖励此种工业创造，特发贷款扶植，鼓励其继续发展。"

    "content": "The Annihilation of Yan's Bandit Elite Training Division\n　　Bo Zhuang, Jian Guang\n　　On June 21st, Yan Xishan's \"Elite Training Division\" 72nd Division in Xishan, along with the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the \"Elite Training\" Mountain Artillery Regiment, personally led by Division Commander Chen Zhendong, advanced from Zhujiabao in Jiexiu along the Tongpu Railway towards Caocun in Pingyao. They were constantly on edge, fearing annihilation by the People's Liberation Army. \"Each regiment advanced in three columns abreast, with intervals of 200 to 300 meters between columns, and each column had to contact its superior every half hour, stipulating that the left, right, and directly subordinate central columns should all take the north side of the railway as the standard.\" (Chen Zhendong's diary from the front) Finally, they were as careful as could be.\n\n　　This \"Elite Training Division\" was a so-called elite division that Yan Xishan had carefully selected from his various subordinate units. Compared to Yan's other troops, it was particularly well-manned and equipped. In addition to being personally trained by Yan Xishan, it had also been trained for a long time by Japanese prisoners of war retained by him. Since its official formation in July of last year, the division had been stationed in Taiyuan without being deployed. Ten days ago, it was dispatched from Taiyuan for the first time, heading to Jiexiu, supposedly to \"defend\" central Shanxi and \"defend\" Taiyuan. But as soon as it arrived in Jiexiu, it encountered the People's Liberation Army launching a powerful offensive towards central Shanxi, and quickly recovered Lingshi City, making Chen Zhendong uneasy, and he hurriedly ordered the entire division to retreat towards Pingyao, attempting to escape annihilation by the People's Liberation Army.\n\n　　Things did not go smoothly. As soon as Yan's bandits departed from Dafu Village, they discovered a unit of the People's Liberation Army. Yan's mountain artillery hurriedly opened fire, but the People's Liberation Army ignored them and retreated. Yan's bandits breathed a sigh of relief and continued to move forward, steeling themselves. But not far ahead, an unknown number of People's Liberation Army troops suddenly appeared on the left side of Yan's bandits. Shells rained down on the ranks of Yan's bandits, creating deafening explosions. Yan's bandits fled forward in panic, only to encounter another unit of the People's Liberation Army head-on, blocking their way. Those who turned to flee west were also surrounded and annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, crying out in vain. At this point, Yan's bandits finally awoke as if from a dream, realizing that they had fallen into the dragnet set by the People's Liberation Army.\n\n　　The cannons and machine guns of the People's Liberation Army roared non-stop, and the formation of Yan's bandits had long been disrupted. Some scattered and fled, while others shrank into a ball like foul mud. Before the sound of the bugle call for the charge had faded, the courageous People's Liberation Army had already stormed into the positions of Yan's bandits from all directions. Sun Shiliu, a special-class merit recipient of a certain unit, killed an enemy with a single bayonet thrust. He Guisheng, the squad leader of the Third Squad, who was wounded, even grappled with an enemy, and Zhang Mingkuan, another soldier, seeing this, raised his gun and shot the enemy down. The machine gunner of the First Platoon, holding his machine gun, swept towards the enemy like a whirlwind. More than a dozen enemies fled into a wheat field, but a burst of machine-gun fire brought them all down. Zhu Zuocheng, the squad leader of the Ninth Squad of the Sixth Company of a certain unit, closely followed and rushed into the wheat field. Four enemies rose from the ground and engaged him in bayonet fighting. He had no bayonet, so he raised his gun and shot one enemy dead. While ejecting the cartridge, the second enemy rushed up, and he used the muzzle of his gun to push the enemy down again. The third enemy stabbed him in the arm with a knife. He retreated backward, and with a bang, shot the enemy down again. The fourth enemy had not yet approached when he was shot in the back and fell to the ground, unable to move. The brave soldiers of the Fourth Company of a certain unit charged towards an enemy artillery position, and more than thirty enemy artillerymen were so frightened that they automatically gathered and surrendered their cannons.\n\n　　Under the repeated assaults of the People's Liberation Army, Yan's bandits, like a swarm of bees, were driven by the People's Liberation Army from east to north, and from north to south, on the open ground along the Fen River, less than five li long from Dafu to Caocun; after fighting in the south, they fled to the north again; hiding in the trenches, they were driven out by cannons; scurrying onto the flat ground, they were shot by machine guns and could not raise their heads. In this way, thousands upon thousands of Yan's bandits were captured. A group of Yan's bandits tried to cross the Fen River to escape, but as soon as they reached the riverbank or the center of the river, they were all annihilated. In just three hours, this Yan's \"Elite Training Division\" and \"Elite Training Mountain Artillery Regiment,\" having engaged the People's Liberation Army for the first time, were completely annihilated.\n\n　　In July of last year, Yan Xishan said at the founding ceremony of the \"Elite Training Division\": \"The Elite Training Division must coexist and succeed with me. Where there is the Elite Training Division, there is me; where there is the Elite Training Division, there is Taiyuan.\" Now that this \"Elite Training Division\" has reached its final resting place, one wonders if Yan Xishan will \"co-exist\" and \"achieve benevolence\" with it?!

Attendees included representatives from the South Korean Democratic People's Front, the South Korean Workers' Party, the People's Republican Party, the Democratic Independence Party, the Labor People's Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Korean Independence Party, the Korean Labor Federation, the Korean Farmers' Alliance, and the North Korean Democratic People's United Front, the Labor Party (i.e., the Communist Party), the Democratic Party, the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions, and other organizations. The conference discussed the Korean political situation after the South Korean sham election and further strategies for striving for Korean reunification. The conference passed a resolution summarizing the struggle of the country's democratic forces against the South Korean sham election and politically analyzed this sham election. The resolution pointed out that the vast majority of the Korean people had conducted widespread demonstrations, worker strikes, and popular uprisings in areas such as Jeju Island to oppose the measures taken by the US military authorities to force the implementation of the sham election through terror and violence. The resolution emphasized that the Korean people refuse to recognize the \"National Assembly\" formed by violence (which includes eighty-four large landlords, thirty-two capitalists, twenty-three pro-Japanese officials, and the leaders of the most reactionary right-wing parties, with not a single worker or farmer) and the reactionary, anti-democratic \"draft constitution\" it passed. The resolution called on all democratic parties in Korea to fight for the establishment of a truly democratic and unified legislative body and a unified national government. To this end, the conference decided to establish a Supreme People's Assembly of Korea elected by election and a single Korean government composed of representatives from North and South Korea. The conference reiterated the Korean people's firm support for the Soviet proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and called on the Korean people to fight for the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state.\n    Note: Representatives of various parties and organizations from North and South Korea held their first joint conference in Pyongyang from April 19th to 27th, resolving to launch a nationwide boycott movement against the May 10th election unilaterally implemented by the US occupying authorities in South Korea; and adopted a statement to the Soviet and American governments, announcing their approval of and request for the implementation of the Soviet proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea. The Soviet Union replied expressing its agreement with this request, but the United States refused.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Seoul dispatch: US imperialism is intensifying the creation of a divided puppet government in South Korea, according to its pre-planned conspiracy. The South Korean pseudo-National Assembly, held in Seoul on May 31st, passed an extremely reactionary and anti-democratic \"constitution\" on July 11th and \"scheduled to start organizing a new government on the 14th\" (Associated Press). A Central News Agency dispatch from Seoul on June 30th revealed the overall process and purpose of the US imperialists in creating a puppet government in South Korea; according to this procedure, the pseudo-\"National Assembly\" is scheduled to formulate a \"constitution\" on August 14th and establish a government on September 15th, so as to \"establish a de facto government before the UN General Assembly convenes in Paris on September 21st,\" attempting to obtain recognition from the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 争取建立全国统一的人民政府　南北鲜领袖二次集议  美在南鲜加紧制造傀儡政府\n\n1948-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　争取建立全国统一的人民政府\n    南北鲜领袖二次集议\n    美在南鲜加紧制造傀儡政府\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社平壤十日电，南北鲜各政党及公共团体领袖，六月二十九至七月五日在平壤举行第二次联席会议。出席会议者有南鲜的民主人民阵线、南鲜劳工党、人民共和党、民主独立党、劳动人民党、社会民主党、朝鲜独立党、朝鲜劳工联合会、朝鲜农民同盟及北鲜的民主人民统一阵线、劳动党（按即共产党）。民主党、北鲜职工联合会等团体的代表多人。会议讨论了南鲜伪选后的朝鲜政治情势及争取朝鲜统一斗争的进一步方策。大会通过决议一件，总结了该国民主力量反对南鲜伪选的斗争，并从政治上分析了这一伪选。决议指出，绝大多数朝鲜人民曾进行广泛示威、工人罢工与济州岛等地的人民起义，以反对美军当局以恐怖与暴力强迫实行伪选的措施。决议着重声明，朝鲜人民拒绝承认以暴力组成的“国民议会”（它包括八十四个大地主，三十二个资本家，二十三个亲日官员和最反动的右翼党派领袖，没有一个工人或农民）及其所通过的反动的反民主的“宪法草案”。决议呼吁朝鲜一切民主党派为建立真正民主的统一立法机关及统一的全国政府而斗争。为此，大会决定设立由选举产生的朝鲜最高人民议会及由南北鲜代表组成的单一朝鲜政府。会议重申朝鲜人民坚主苏联所提外国军队同时撤离朝鲜的建议，并号召朝鲜人民为建立统一、独立与民主的朝鲜国家而斗争。\n    按：南北鲜各党派各团体的代表，曾于四月十九至二十七日在平壤举行第一次联席会议，决议对美占领当局在南鲜片面实行的五月十日选举，进行全国性抵制运动；并通过致苏美两国政府的声明，宣布赞同并要求实行苏联所提关于外国军队同时撤离朝鲜的建议。苏联曾复文表示同意此一要求，但美国则表拒绝。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】汉城消息：美帝国主义正按照其预定阴谋，加紧在南鲜制造分裂的傀儡政府。五月三十一日在汉城举行的南鲜伪国会，已于七月十一日通过极反动的反民主“宪法”，并“订于十四日开始筹组新政府”（合众社）。中央社六月三十日的汉城电讯，透露出美帝在南鲜制造傀儡政府的全国程序及其目的；按照此一程序，伪“国会”订于八月十四日制订“宪法”，于九月十五日成立政府，以便“九月二十一日联大在巴黎开会之前成立一事实上之政府”，企图获得联大之认可。"

    "content": "Exchanging Experience in Protecting Wheat with Explosives\n    Taihang Opens Border Area Explosives Conference\n    Yubei Fourth Military Sub-district Kills and Wounds Over 100 Enemies in One Month\n    [Taihang Electric] In order to better carry out the explosive movement to protect grain, Taihang Border Area successively convened explosives conferences in late June. The Yubei Fourth Military Sub-district's Military Commission convened cadres with explosive experience to exchange explosive experiences in the wheat protection battle, conduct landmine exhibitions, and collectively observe and critique. They unanimously recommended the \"three-sound mine\" and \"three-strand fuse mine\" as the best. Detailed research and discussion were conducted on various types of mines (pressure mine, surface mine, trip mine, kick mine, three-strand fuse mine, pull mine, winnowing fan mine, drop mine, three-sound mine, etc.) regarding organization, division of labor, required tools, suitable terrain, digging, ignition, and camouflage. After the discussion, tactical exercises were conducted, yielding significant results. Finally, everyone examined that past explosives work was not good enough, mainly due to poor technology and insufficient integration with tactics. The explosives expert meeting held in Yuci County, Jinzhong, examined the obstacles to the failure to universally carry out the explosives movement in the first half of the year: (1) Labor and military were not combined; some militiamen were busy with production and abandoned the struggle against the enemy. (2) Deviations occurred in party rectification, which also produced extreme democratic tendencies; some militiamen and self-defense forces did not obey leadership. (3) Mine-laying technology was not studied and improved, resulting in some losses. (4) Some places were complacent and negligent, intelligence work was unsound, and the development of landmine warfare was abandoned. Finally, it was decided to clear the obstacles and launch a \"thousand mine\" movement. Taigu County also held an 80-person explosives training class to cultivate explosive talent and carry out the explosives movement.\n    [Taihang Electric] The Yubei Fourth Military Sub-district launched a mass explosive movement in the struggle to protect wheat. In one month, a total of 132 enemies were killed and wounded. After the Military Sub-district's wheat protection conference in early May proposed launching a \"ten thousand mine\" movement, the Military Commission actively rushed to manufacture a large number of landmines and distributed them to various counties. The counties also convened mobilization meetings at all levels, settled accounts with the complacent and negligent thinking of some cadres, and separately opened explosives training classes to train a large number of explosives experts. Jiaozuo, Bo'ai, and other counties also specifically organized forces, delineated minefields, and responsible cadres personally led the mine-laying. At the same time, propaganda was conducted about our army's victory, exposing the enemy's desperate atrocities, and arousing the fighting spirit of the masses. Xiuwu First District launched a \"each household x number of watchdog\" movement. After seven days of concentrated effort, all villages had stone mines. Thousands of stone mines were manufactured in two or three days. Women in Dongzhuang and Da Xiaozhai in Jiaozuo also learned to assemble stone mines and make explosive tubes. Now every household is making stone mines. On May 27th, the Xiuwu Second District rotation team, in coordination with the district cadre team, used landmine warfare combined with sniper warfare to repel the enemy's invasion of over 700 people to seize wheat, killing and wounding six enemies. On May 6th, the Bo'ai Eighth District West Joint Defense militia also used landmines combined with sparrow warfare to repel the invasion of 500+ Chiang bandits, killing and wounding over 20 bandits. On June 2nd, when the enemy invaded Dong Wanzhen Village in Xiuwu First District, they stepped on a landmine at the ditch in the northwest corner of the village, killing one person; when they pushed open a gate to enter the village, there was a loud bang, wounding two enemies; when they entered the house door, another person was wounded. When three Chiang bandits went to grab the wheat placed in a winnowing fan in the courtyard, the mine buried underneath went off with a loud bang, and all three Chiang bandits were wounded. Since then, the enemy dared not enter the gate, dared not touch anything, and dared not rummage around. On June 3rd, the enemy's 40th Division, 318th Regiment, in coordination with miscellaneous diehards, a total of more than 3,000, invaded the Beiguanzhuang area of Wuzhi to seize wheat. Most of our masses were transferred, leaving the task of guarding the threshing ground and house doors to the landmines. When the enemy came, the three villages of Beiguanzhuang, Da Li Village, and Ma Village detonated 27 landmines, killing 20 enemy company commanders and platoon leaders. In total, from May 10th to June 10th, in one month, according to incomplete statistics, landmines killed and wounded 132 enemies, including Hou Deqing, the deputy head of the puppet Special Commissioner's Office Security Regiment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 交流保麦爆炸经验　太行开边沿区爆炸会议  豫北四分区一月炸死炸伤敌百余\n\n1948-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　交流保麦爆炸经验\n    太行开边沿区爆炸会议\n    豫北四分区一月炸死炸伤敌百余\n    【太行电】太行边地为更好开展护粮爆炸运动，曾于六月下旬先后召开爆炸会议。豫北四分区武委会召集有爆炸经验的干部开会，交流保麦战中的爆炸经验，进行地雷展览，集体参观、批评，一致推荐三响雷、三股弦雷等为最好。并把各种雷雷（踏雷、地皮雷、拌雷、踢雷、三股弦雷、拉雷、簸箕雷、坠雷、三响雷等）从组织分工、需用工具、适用地形，及挖洞、接火、伪装，都做了细密的研究讨论。讨论后，又进行战术实习，收效甚大。最后大家检查过去爆炸还不够好，主要是技术太差，和战术结合不够。晋中榆次县召开的爆炸能手会议上，检查了前半年爆炸运动未能普遍开展的障碍是：（一）劳武没结合，有些民兵忙于生产，放弃对敌斗争。（二）整党发生偏差，同时产生极端民主的偏向，有些民兵自卫队不服从领导。（三）埋雷技术不研究，提不高，以致遭受部分损失。（四）有的地方轻敌麻痹，情报工作不健全，放弃开展地雷战。最后决定扫清障碍，开展千雷运动。太谷县并举办八十人的爆炸训练班，培养爆炸人才，开展爆炸运动。\n    【太行电】豫北四分区在护麦斗争中，开展了群众性的爆炸运动。一个月中，共炸死炸伤敌一百三十二名。五月初分区保麦会议上提出开展万雷运动后，该分区武委会就积极赶造了大量地雷发与各县，各县也召开了各级动员会，清算了某些干部思想上的轻敌麻痹，分别开办爆炸训练班，训练出大批爆炸手。焦作、博爱等县并具体组织力量，划定雷区，负责干部亲自领导埋设。同时宣传我军胜利，揭发敌人垂死挣扎的暴行，激发了群众斗志。修武一区开展每家×个看门狗运动，经七天突击，各村都有了石雷。两三天内制造石雷×千个。焦作东庄、大小寨妇女也都学会装石雷，造爆炸管，现家家都造了石雷。五月二十七日，修武二区轮战队配合区干队，用地雷战结合冷枪战，击退敌七百余人的抢麦进犯，并毙伤敌六名。五月六日，博爱八区西联防民兵，也以地雷结合麻雀战，击退五百余蒋匪的进犯，毙伤匪二十余名。六月二号，敌人进犯修武一区东万斟村，经村西北角路沟，踏响一个地雷，炸死一名；进村一推大门，轰的一声，炸伤敌二名；进屋门时又炸伤一名。当三个蒋匪去抢放在当院簸箕里的麦子时，底下埋的雷又是轰的一声，三个蒋匪均被炸伤。从此敌人见门不敢进，见物不敢动，更不敢乱刨乱找了。六月三日，焦作敌四十师三一八团配合杂顽共三千余，进犯我武陟北官庄一带抢麦，我群众大部转移，把看守场和家门的任务交给地雷。敌人来时，北官庄、大李村、马村等三个村，爆炸地雷二十七个，炸死敌中队长、分队长以下二十名。总计五月十日至六月十日一个月中，据不完全统计，地雷毙伤敌伪专署保安副团长侯德清以下一百三十二名。"

    "content": "(Jilu Yu Electric) Under the leadership and assistance of the working group of the prefectural committee, Chalu Village in the Fourth District of Nanfeng has launched a surge of planting. Initially, the Chalu working group did not adopt the method of first having a few households set an example, gain experience, and then promote it throughout the village, but only made general calls for planting and watering seedlings, which resulted in failure. The comrades of the working group were very anxious and conducted self-criticism, deciding to start with the branch. They held a branch meeting, educating and calling on party members to take the lead in guiding the masses to plant and water seedlings. Party members recognized the importance and benefits of planting and responded unanimously to the call to \"work at the forefront.\" The next day, Wu Mingyun and Wu Qiyun started working. Wu Mingyun dug holes and spread fertilizer while planting seedlings, with one person digging holes and two people carrying water, planting 400 sweet potato seedlings in half a day. That evening, a farmers' meeting was held, using Wu Mingyun's example to publicize to the masses, and the masses calculated the benefits in groups: one mu of sweet potatoes can produce 1,000 jin, which can replace two mu of grain. As long as the sweet potatoes are harvested, there will be no fear in the second half of the year. Through this typical demonstration and accounting method, the masses' thinking was cleared, and they all felt that it would be impossible to plant if it was too late. The next day, the old village chief Wu Dongyun also carried water and planted seedlings. Activist Bai Junqi and his seventh uncle helped each other to plant. His ten-year-old son scattered seedlings and watered them, and his fifteen-year-old daughter spread fertilizer. He and his seventh uncle dug holes. The whole family, young and old, planted 500 seedlings in one day. In the evening, the couple sealed the soil one by one while it was cool, which greatly influenced the masses. The next day, they continued to plant 800 seedlings, which had a great impact on the masses. In the evening, the Junqi couple was praised by the loudspeaker, explaining how much they had planted and what the benefits were, which enlightened the masses throughout the village. By June 5th, a planting boom had formed throughout the village. Ma Jifu planted 1,400 seedlings in two nights. Some people regretted and said, \"It would have been so good to plant a few days earlier!\" Others said, \"It's not too late to start now, it won't work if it's any later.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 党员带头推动全村岔楼积极抗旱点种\n\n1948-07-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　党员带头推动全村岔楼积极抗旱点种\n    【冀鲁豫电】南峰四区岔楼村在地委工作组的领导帮助下，掀起点种热潮。最初岔楼工作组没有采用先由几户作出样子，取得经验，推动全村的办法，只是一般的号召点种浇苗，结果落了空。工作组同志很着急，自己作了检讨，决定先从支部作起。开了支部大会，教育、号召党员先作起来，带头引导群众点种浇苗。党员认识到点种的重要和好处，一致响应“干到头里”的号召。第二天吴明云、吴其云就下了手，吴明云一面挖坑撒粪，一面栽秧，一个人捣坑，两个人担水，一晌就栽了四百棵红薯。当晚召开农民大会，用吴明云的事实当样子向群众宣传，群众分伙算起帐来：一亩红薯能出一千斤，能顶二亩粮食吃，只要收了红薯，下半年就不怕了。经过这种典型示范和算帐的方法，打通了群众的思想，都感觉再晚了想栽也栽不成了。第二天，老村长吴东云也挑水栽起来。积极分子白俊起和他七叔互助栽，十岁的儿子散秧浇水，十五岁的女儿撒粪，他和七叔捣坑，一家男女老少，一天栽了五百棵，晚上，俩口子又趁凉一棵一棵封上土。第二天接着又栽了八百棵，影响群众很大。晚上用广播筒表扬了俊起夫妇，说明他们栽了多少，有啥好处，启发了全村群众。到六月五日，全村形成了栽种热潮。马吉服两晚上就栽了一千四百棵。有的人后悔说：“早几天栽了有多好？”有的说：“这时下手还不晚，再晚就不行了。”"

The Prefectural Committee summarized the experience of Chalu Village in leading point planting, stating: Educate Party members and activists, make a breakthrough at one point, set an example while expanding propaganda, use facts to persuade the masses, and break the old habit of relying on the heavens for food; cadres should conduct in-depth leadership, personally take action, provide specific help, develop from a few to a majority, and develop the point planting movement into a upsurge. The Prefectural Committee also pointed out that many comrades always want a call to be made and the masses to respond, are unwilling to start from the smallest things, look down on a load of water and a sweet potato seedling, and are unwilling to work hard and go deep, starting by uniting a few activists, and as a result, the call will inevitably fail. The circular called on everyone to start with planting sweet potatoes, and further point-plant major crops such as beans and corn, from point planting to watering seedlings, from nearby land to distant land. Each step should implement typical demonstrations, make a breakthrough in one or several households, set an example, use facts to educate the masses, and gradually improve the masses' awareness and confidence, turning point planting, watering seedlings, drought resistance, and preparedness against famine into a conscious movement of the masses.\n    [Another dispatch] The Nanfeng Tanzhuang work team leads the masses in point planting and watering seedlings. When the work team first mobilized the masses, they met with resistance. Tan Xi Jiu said: \"Comrades, I am not as good as you at doing work, but you are not as good as me at planting crops. I have thought of everything, and the method you said is not right!\" At the same time, others said: \"People are busy but the heavens are not, and when the heavens are busy, it's only one rain, ... a downpour will plant everything.\" The work team studied the masses' thinking of \"waiting\" and \"relying on the heavens,\" and believed that if they really wanted to mobilize the masses, they must take action themselves and first help a few households. So, they repeatedly propagated to Tan Kezun and got through to him. He decided to first plant the seven or eight fen of land in the northeast corner of the village near the well, and the work team helped him carry water, dig ditches, and cover the soil to plant the seeds. When the masses saw this, their thinking began to change, and Zhong Henian, the vice chairman of the farmers' association, also agreed to plant seeds as soon as possible, saying: \"Crops cannot be delayed, planting one day earlier makes a difference.\" Tan Datu and his brother planted six or seven fen of corn and wanted to plant another two fen of carrots. He said: \"Planting these carrots and mixing them with corn, in case of disaster, it will be enough for a family of six or seven to eat for a month.\" Erdahei's land is in the south, far from the well. He used a trailer to carry three water tanks, and used three small oxen to pull the water to the field. He pulled thirty-six loads of water in four trips and quickly planted the seeds. They mostly use the furrow planting method, turning the land into furrows, putting the seeds down, sweeping it with a broom from the furrow, covering it with a layer of floating soil, and then watering it until the water reaches the height of the furrow ridge. Some people dig the furrows first, then water them before sowing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫九地委号召学习岔楼点种经验\n\n1948-07-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫九地委号召学习岔楼点种经验\n    【又讯】冀鲁豫九地委发出通报，号召各级干部学习南峰四区岔楼村工作组领导群众抗旱点种的经验，把点种浇苗造成群众运动。地委总结岔楼村领导点种的经验称：教育党员和积极分子，突破一点，一边作出样子，一边扩大宣传，用事实说服群众，打破群众靠天吃饭的老习惯；干部深入领导，亲自下手，具体帮助，由少数发展为多数，把点种运动发展成热潮。地委同时指出，许多同志总想一声号召，群众响应，不肯从点滴作起，看不起一担水一棵红薯，不肯艰苦深入，由团结少数积极分子作起，结果号召必然落空。通报中号召大家由栽红薯作起，进一步点种大庄稼如豆子、棒子等，由点种引到浇苗，由近地引到远地。每一步都要贯彻典型示范，突破一户或几户，作出样子，用事实教育群众，步步提高群众觉悟如信心，把点种、浇苗、抗旱备荒，造成群众自觉的运动。\n    【又电】南峰谭庄工作组，领导群众点种浇苗。工作组刚向群众动员时碰了钉子，谭西九说：“同志：干工作俺不如您，种庄稼您不如俺。俺啥都想到了，您说的法不中！”同时还有的说：“人忙天不忙，天忙只一场，………哗啦一场啥都中了。”工作组研究了群众这种“等待”、“靠天”的思想情况，认为要想真正把群众动员起来，必须亲自动手，首先帮助几户。于是向谭可尊反复宣传，打通了他的思想。他确定先点种村东北角靠井近的那七八分地，工作组就动手帮他挑水、挖沟、盖土，把种点上。群众看见，思想开始转变，副农会主席钟合年也赞同及早点种了，他说：“庄稼不让晚，早种一天一个样”。谭大突和他弟弟种了六、七分玉蜀黍，还要再种二分红萝卜。他说：“种这点红萝卜，掺点棒子，遇着灾荒一家六七口可以够吃一个月”。二大黑的地在南头，距井远，他用拖车载上三个水缸，用三个小牛把水拉到地里，四趟拉了三十六挑水，很快把种点上了。他们多用批沟点种法，将地批成沟，把种放下去，用笤帚从沟中扫一遍，盖上一层浮上，再浇水，水浇到沟背齐。也有先把沟批好，先浇水后下种的。"

During this period, Fu Zuoyi implemented his so-called \"new strategy\" of using main forces against main forces and concentration against concentration, wanting to engage in \"mobile warfare\" with the People's Liberation Army. Now, facts have proven that Fu Zuoyi's so-called \"new strategy\" has created insurmountable new contradictions for himself. His concentration of forces resulted in the isolated points and lines losing defensive strength, while the so-called mobile forces were insufficient to cope with the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army. In this Eastern Hebei front campaign, the People's Liberation Army first carried out destruction on the Ping-Gu line, attracting nearly four corps of Fu Zuoyi's forces, including the 94th, 16th, 92nd, and Provisional 3rd Corps. At this time, the People's Liberation Army took advantage of the situation to launch an offensive on the northern side of Tang (shan) Luan (xian), achieving the victory of recovering Fengrun and eliminating more than 6,000 enemies. When Fu's enemy dragged the 16th Corps, 92nd Corps, and Provisional 3rd Corps to reinforce Fengrun, the People's Liberation Army rapidly launched a major destruction on the Ping-Gu line, occupied Shixia and Xiaoying, eliminated more than 2,000 enemies, and advanced directly to Gubeikou. Fu's enemy then turned back to the west to reinforce Ping-Gu overnight, and just as they arrived in Miyun and Shunyi, the People's Liberation Army launched a destruction of the Luan-Yu section and achieved the victory of occupying Changli, eliminating 4,000 enemies, and capturing Lieutenant General Tang Yisheng, the chief of the traffic police. In these 20-plus days of combat, in the face of the offensive of our People's Liberation Army, Fu's enemy was unable to attend to both the head and the tail, was beaten everywhere, and was exhausted from running around.

    "title": "Eastern China Military Observer Comments on Our Army's Victory in the Kaifeng-Eastern Henan Campaign",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-20",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, July 17th: A military observer from the East China People's Liberation Army commented on the great victory in Kaifeng and the Eastern Henan Campaign. He pointed out that the PLA's capture of Kaifeng, annihilating 39,000 enemy troops, and the annihilation of over 50,000 troops from the Kuomintang bandit Qu Shounian, Huang Botao, and Qiu Qingquan corps in the Sui County area of Eastern Henan, capturing corps commander Qu Shounian and the 75th Division Commander Shen Chengnian alive, will play a significant role in continuing to eliminate the enemy's active forces in the Central Plains in large numbers, changing the Central Plains war situation, and further consolidating the construction of the Central Plains Liberated Area. The enemy, having suffered a painful blow, and facing the PLA's future, even more powerful offensive, will inevitably continue to abandon certain points and lines, and use the method of \"patching up the east wall to mend the west,\" sending troops wherever there is an emergency, to barely support themselves. However, strategically, they will become even more passive, and their troop strength will inevitably be even more insufficient. Their attempt to concentrate a portion of their troops for a strategic defense-based tactical offensive, to engage in a seesaw struggle with us in the Central Plains, will also gradually decrease, and they will eventually be exhausted and unable to cope, leading to a fundamental change in the Central Plains war situation. At the same time, as a result of the enemy being forced to transfer troops from the Central China and Shandong battlefields to reinforce the Central Plains, it will be even more convenient for the PLA to conduct offensives smoothly on those battlefields. The observer went on to analyze the great significance of the PLA's capture of Kaifeng, which is not only military but also political, especially a great victory in policy. The observer stated: As the capital of Henan Province, a major military stronghold and the reactionary ruling nerve center of the Kuomintang bandits in the Central Plains, Kaifeng is a city that has been fortified for a long time. Chiang Kai-shek himself personally guaranteed to the puppet National Assembly representatives of Henan during his \"Piglet National Congress\" that it could not be lost. However, just as the Kuomintang bandits were gathering their large forces in southwestern Shandong, boasting about their so-called \"mobile warfare,\" the PLA suddenly appeared under the walls of Kaifeng and captured it in one fell swoop, proving that no city heavily fortified by the Kuomintang bandits is impregnable. And the PLA's strategic initiative completely disrupted the Kuomintang bandits' troop deployment, forcing them to hastily transfer troops from various places to reinforce it. In addition to mobilizing almost all of the Kuomintang bandits' mobile forces in the Central Plains, even the 83rd Division, 72nd Division, 25th Division, and 63rd Division from central Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, Huainan, and Shandong were scraped together; however, they were all hundreds of miles away and were subjected to effective interception and annihilation by the PLA's fraternal corps. By the time they arrived under the walls of Kaifeng, it was already too late. On the contrary, they formed a posture of being beaten, creating a good opportunity for the PLA to continue to annihilate the Qu Shounian corps in the Sui County area of Eastern Henan.\n\nThe observer continued: The capture of Kaifeng most vividly demonstrated the political support of the people: on the one hand, due to the Kuomintang bandits' criminal dictatorial rule, especially the wanton bombing and looting of the Kaifeng urban area, disregarding the lives and property of millions of people, it aroused the people of Kaifeng's hatred for the Kuomintang bandits. On the other hand, the PLA's lenient policy, the policy of protecting national industry and commerce, the cultural and educational policy, the religious policy, and strict urban discipline were wholeheartedly and warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people of Kaifeng. Although the PLA only stayed in Kaifeng for a short four days, the PLA's political views and various democratic policies have taken root in the hearts of the people. Many university professors and thousands of young students participated in work and study in the liberated areas, and many people from all walks of life voluntarily cooperated with the PLA to jointly maintain social order. The PLA has brought unlimited courage to the suffering people of Kaifeng, and the PLA has become a symbol of future happiness in the hearts of the people of Kaifeng. The people of Kaifeng's clear political support is something the Kuomintang bandits can no longer reverse. The Kuomintang bandits not only cannot defeat the PLA militarily, but also cannot defeat the PLA politically. The Kuomintang bandits have alienated themselves from the people of Kaifeng, and from now on, Kaifeng will forever become a city of the people. When the PLA temporarily withdrew from Kaifeng in order to continue to annihilate the enemy's active forces, the people of Kaifeng were deeply convinced that the PLA would soon return in triumph. The great victory in Sui County, Eastern Henan, will undoubtedly give the people of Kaifeng the greatest excitement first. They will count the days, and the PLA's re-liberation of Kaifeng will not be too long.\n\nThe observer then pointed out: The PLA's swift launch of an offensive operation against the Kuomintang bandit Qu Shounian corps in the Sui County area of Eastern Henan immediately after the victory in Kaifeng was completely unexpected by the Kuomintang bandits. Chiang Kai-shek mistakenly estimated that the PLA had been wounded after the Kaifeng campaign and had to carry out rest and replenishment. He never expected that the PLA would have such a surprising and winning move. The observer stated: The PLA's continuous offensive in the Sui County area came suddenly and was fought fiercely, causing the Qu Shounian corps, which had entered the Sui County area, to have no time to shrink back, and could not wait for the \"east-west pincer movement\" rescue, and was quickly surrounded, divided, and annihilated. Huang Botao's corps was willing to disregard the encirclement of Yanzhou and rushed from the Jinpu Railway line at a long distance. Not only could it not save Qu's corps, but it also lost half of itself.\n\nThe observer praised the PLA's continuous fighting as the main reason for winning this victory in Eastern Henan, and an important symbol of the PLA's unprecedented strength after the new-style reorganization and training. All commanders and fighters of the PLA unanimously demonstrated a high degree of conscious spirit of fighting for the people in this campaign, overcoming sweltering heat, hunger, fatigue, and all difficulties, and fought continuously and tenaciously. Thanks to the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the guarantee of political work, and also making a large number of Kuomintang soldiers just liberated from Kaifeng immediately join the PLA in combat; a large number of weapons and ammunition newly captured from Kaifeng were immediately used to fight back against the enemy; one task after another was successfully completed. The PLA's tactical and technical level has also greatly improved, and the fraternal units closely coordinated in combat. The firepower was unprecedentedly fierce. From siege, field battles to blocking battles, they all demonstrated countless examples of the combination of bravery and resourcefulness. Especially in the battle to block the Kuomintang bandit's elite Fifth Army, the PLA used fewer troops to fight more, and stubbornly defended its position with strong counterattacks, repelling the enemy's fierce attacks with aircraft, tanks, and so-called \"human bomb\" tactics. In the blocking battle, they also captured guns and prisoners. For the past ten days, they have kept tens of thousands of Kuomintang bandits from the Fifth Division, the Seventieth Division, and the Eighty-third Division stagnant in the vicinity of Sui County, unable to move forward, watching as they were only twenty miles away from Qu's corps, and finally unable to save its fate of being annihilated. The PLA not only thoroughly and cleanly annihilated the three reorganized brigades of Qu's corps and nearly half of Huang Botao's corps, but also subjected every Kuomintang bandit invading our Sui County area to devastating blows.\n\nAccording to Shen Chengnian, the captured commander of the Kuomintang bandit's 75th Division, they have completely failed in the first round of the \"Eastern Henan Decisive Battle.\" This is something that no amount of deceptive propaganda by the Kuomintang bandits can cover up. If the so-called \"Eastern Henan War has achieved a decisive victory\" recently boasted by the Kuomintang bandits is indeed a little bit true, then may I ask where their corps commander Qu Shounian and division commander Shen Chengnian and all of his 75th Division, all of the New 21st Brigade, and a part of Huang Botao's corps have gone? Can you please ask him to come out and talk about the specific situation of the \"victory\"? Originally, the Kuomintang bandits' so-called \"great victory\" is nothing more than saying that some of their troops temporarily escaped the fate of being completely annihilated, and can Chiang Kai-shek, who is now in his twilight years, still not issue an extra \"celebratory\" edition for this?\n\nThe observer finally pointed out: The victories in Kaifeng and Eastern Henan have caused the Kuomintang bandits to lose a total of 100,000 men in one month (including the annihilation of the enemy by various fraternal corps in blocking actions). Therefore, it has caused extreme chaos and anxiety within the Kuomintang bandits' reactionary ruling camp, and will to a large extent cause the Kuomintang bandits' reactionary rule in the Central Plains to collapse. Especially the remaining local Kuomintang bandits in Henan, because Kaifeng cannot be secured, will lose their last bit of confidence. It is no wonder that Chiang Kai-shek himself had to fly to the skies over Eastern Henan again and again to personally direct; but it is precisely this personal direction that demonstrates the greatest incompetence, and it is destined that the Kuomintang bandits will inevitably suffer the fate of being completely annihilated. In order to try to rescue his failure, Chiang Kai-shek wantonly bombed the urban area of Kaifeng and the countryside with a large number of American-made aircraft, turning the beautiful ancient capital and the lives and property of millions of people into ashes. Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, should bear full responsibility for this inhumane fascist bloody crime, and they will suffer even more severe punishment from the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东军事观察家　评我军开封豫东之捷\n\n1948-07-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华东军事观察家　评我军开封豫东之捷\n    【新华社豫东前线十七日电】华东人民解放军军事观察家评论开封及豫东大捷。指出解放军攻克开封，歼敌三万九千人及在豫东睢＠地区歼灭蒋匪区寿年、黄伯韬、邱清泉三兵团各一部共五万余人，活捉兵团司令区寿年整七十五师师长沈澄年的伟大胜利，对于今后继续在中原大量歼灭敌人有生力量，改变中原战局及进一步巩固中原解放区的建设，将起重大作用。遭受惨痛打击的敌人，而对着解放军未来更加强大的攻势，势将继续以放弃某些点线，并用拆东补西，那里告急那里去兵的办法，来勉强支持。但在战略上将更加被动，兵力亦必更为不足，其企图集中一部分部队作战略防御下的战役进攻，以与我对中原进行拉锯争夺的可能也将逐渐减少，终必穷于应付而使中原战局将发生根本的变化。同时，由于敌被迫自华中与山东等战场抽调兵力增援中原的结果，也就更加便利于各该战场解放军顺利的进行进攻。观察家继分析解放军攻克开封的重大意义，不仅是军事上的、而且是在政治上的，特别是在政策上打了一个大胜仗。观察家称：作为蒋匪中原军事重镇和反动统治神经中枢的河南省会开封，是一个长期设防的城市，蒋贼在其猪仔国大上，曾亲自向河南伪国大代表保证不能丢失了的。可是正当蒋匪纠集其大量兵力于鲁西南吹嘘着所谓“机动作战”的时候，解放军突然兵临开封城下，并一举攻克之，这证明任何蒋匪紧固设防的城市都不是不可攻破的。而解放军的这种战略上的主动，就完全错乱了蒋匪的兵力部署，迫使其不得不仓惶自各地抽兵增援，除调动了几乎是全部中原蒋匪的机动兵力而外，连在苏中、苏北、淮南、山东的八十三师、七十二师、二十五师、六十三师也都拼凑来了；但都远在百里和数百里路以外，便遭到解放军各兄弟兵团有力的阻击与歼灭性打击，待其赶到开封城下，已经为时太晚了。相反，却摆成了一个挨打的态势，为解放军继续在豫东睢＠县地区歼灭区寿年兵团，创造了良好的战机。\n    观察家继称：开封的攻克，最鲜明的显现了政治上人心的向背：一方面由于蒋匪罪恶的独裁统治，特别是对开封市区的滥肆轰炸，与纵火抢掠，置千万人民的生命财产于不顾，因而激起了开封人民对蒋匪的千仇万恨。另一方面则是解放军的宽大政策，保护民族工商业政策，文化教育政策，宗教政策与严明的城市纪律，受到开封广大人民衷心热烈的欢迎。解放军在开封虽只短短的停留了四天，但解放军的政治主张及各项民主政策已深入人心，许多大学教授及成千的青年学生参加解放区工作和学习，许多社会人士自动起来与解放军合作，共同维持社会秩序，解放军已为苦难的开封人民带来了无限斗争的勇气，解放军在开封人民的心目中，已成为未来的幸福的象征。开封人民在政治上这种明白的向背，是蒋匪再也无法挽回的了。蒋匪不仅在军事上打不过解放军，而且在政治上更打不过解放军，蒋匪已自绝于开封人民，从此开封将永远成为人民的城市。当解放军为着继续歼灭敌人有生力量而暂时撤离开封时，开封人民已深信解放军不久就会凯旋。豫东睢ｚｈī＠①大捷无疑的将首先给开封人民以最大的兴奋，他们会屈指计算，解放军之再度解放开封并不会为时过久的。\n    观察家接着指出：解放军继开封大捷迅即在豫东睢＠地区又发起对蒋匪区寿年兵团的攻势作战，是完全出于蒋匪的意料以外的，蒋贼错误的估计，以为解放军经过开封战役后已经打伤了，必须进行休整补充，万万也料想不到解放军会有这么出奇制胜的一着棋。观察家称：解放军在睢＠地区的连续攻势来得突然，打得勇猛，使进到睢＠地区的区寿年兵团来不及收缩，也等不及“东西对进”的援救，便迅速被包围分割而歼灭了。黄伯韬兵团宁愿置兖州的被围于不顾，从津浦线上远程赶来，不但救不了区兵团，连自己也赔上了一半。\n    观察家至此盛赞解放军的连续战斗乃是赢得此次豫东大捷的主要原因，是解放军经过新式整训后空前强大的重要标志。解放军全体指战员在此次战役中均一致表现了为人民而战的高度自觉精神，克服溽暑，饥饿、疲困和一切困难，连续顽强作战。由于共产党的坚强的领导和政治工作的保证，并使大批刚自开封解放的国民党军士兵立即加入解放军作战；大量甫山开封缴获的武器、弹药，立即又被用来打回敌人方面去，一个任务紧接着一个任务，均胜利的完成。解放军的战术技术水平也大为提高，各兄弟部队密切协同作战，炮火空前猛烈，从攻坚、野战到阻击战斗，均表现了无数英勇与机智结合的范例。特别是在阻击蒋匪精锐第五军的战斗中，解放军以少敌众，以强力的反击固守阵地，打退敌人飞机坦克和所谓“肉弹”战术猛烈的进攻。在阻击战斗中，同样缴枪捉俘虏，十天以来使蒋匪第五师、七十师、八十三师等数万之众，始终停滞于＠县近郊，未能前进一步，眼看着与区兵团相距不过二十余里，终于无法挽救其被歼的命运。解放军不仅彻底干净的歼灭了区兵团的三个整旅，和黄伯韬兵团的几乎近半的兵力，而且使进犯我睢＠地区的每一个蒋匪都遭到歼灭性的打击。\n    据被俘的蒋匪整七十五师师长沈澄年承认在“豫东决战”的第一回合中，他们已完全失败，这是蒋匪任何欺骗宣传都无法掩饰的。如果蒋匪近来吹嘘的所谓“豫东大战已获决定性胜利”果然是有一点点真实性，那么请问他们的兵团司令区寿年和师长沈澄年及其所属的七十五师全部、新二十一旅全部和黄伯韬兵团的一部又到哪里去了呢？能不能请他出来说一说“胜利”的具体情形呢？原来蒋匪的所谓“伟大胜利”，不是别的，只是说他还有一些部队暂时逃脱了完全被歼灭的下场罢了，而这一点对于今天的风烛残年的蒋介石，难道还能不大出其“庆祝”的号外吗？\n    观察家最后指出：开封和豫东大捷使蒋匪在一个月之内足足损失了十万之众（连各兄弟兵团阻击歼敌在内）。因此已引起蒋匪反动统治阵营内部极度的混乱与不安，在很大程度上将使蒋匪在中原的反动统治陷于土崩瓦解。尤以目前在河南尚残存的一些土著蒋匪，由于开封也无法确保，将丧失其最后的一点信心，这也就难怪蒋贼自己不得不惊慌万状的一再飞临豫东上空亲自指挥；但正是这种亲自指挥，才表现了最大的无能，才注定了蒋匪不可避免的要遭到全部被歼的命运。蒋贼为了企图援救其失败，曾以大批美制飞机向开封市区及乡村滥肆轰炸，使美丽的古都和千万人民的生命财产化成灰尽，对于这种灭绝人性的法西斯血腥罪行，蒋贼及其主子美国帝国主义应负完全责任，他们将遭受到人民更严重惩罚。"

    "content": "International Week\n  　　　　　(I)\n　　Representatives of the Communist Parties of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and Italy attended a Cominform meeting held in Bucharest in the second half of June. The meeting discussed the situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party and adopted a resolution. The Cominform resolution pointed out that the Yugoslav Communist leadership group, represented by Tito, Kardelj, Djilas, and Rankovic, has recently violated the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism on fundamental issues of domestic and foreign policy, such as the principled distinctions between socialist and capitalist countries, the necessity and importance of international aid for revolutionary movements in various countries, the theory of class struggle and the leading role of the proletariat in the people's revolutionary cause, the party as the highest form of class organization, democratic centralism in the party, and the role of criticism and self-criticism within the party. They have implemented a treacherous and erroneous policy, thereby falling into the quagmire of bourgeois nationalism and bourgeois political parties. The Cominform called on the healthy elements of the Yugoslav Communist Party to compel the current leaders to openly and sincerely admit their mistakes and correct them. If they are not capable of doing so, then they should be replaced, and a new internationalist leadership organ of the Yugoslav Communist Party should be elected. The Cominform resolution has been approved by the central committees of the Communist Parties that sent representatives to the meeting and has been supported by the CPC, the CPUSA, the CPGB, the CPB, the CPÖ, the Albanian Communist Party, and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. However, the Yugoslav Communist leadership group continues to pursue its erroneous policies and refuses to accept the Cominform resolution.\n    　　　　(II)\n　　Finland held its second parliamentary election after the war on July 1st and 2nd. The final results of the election are as follows: Agrarian League 56 seats; Social Democratic Party 54 seats; Finnish People's Democratic League 38 seats; Conservative Party 33 seats; Swedish People's Party 14 seats; Progressive Party 5 seats. During the election, \"the anti-people parties used all possible means to slander the People's Democratic Front and deceive voters; their representatives abused the electoral law on several occasions\" (Soviet Red Fleet News). At the same time, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party also tried their best to obstruct the unity of the working class and refused to form an electoral alliance with the People's Democratic League. This is one of the main reasons why the reactionaries gained the upper hand in this election. However, the results of the election show that \"despite the fierce attacks by the combined forces of the reactionaries, the democratic camp has maintained its important position\" (Moscow Bolshevik Magazine). But in order to overcome the anti-Soviet and anti-democratic influence that the reactionaries have spread among the people for more than 20 years, it still needs a long struggle.\n    　　　　(III)\n　　As a result of the divisive policies implemented by the occupying authorities of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany, the western occupation zones of Berlin have been cut off from economic ties with the surrounding Soviet occupation zone, and the 2.5 million residents of the area have been plunged into a dire shortage of food, coal, and electricity. The occupying authorities of the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany held a secret meeting in Frankfurt on June 30th; and on July 1st, they held a meeting with the prime ministers of the West German states. A puppet \"West German state\" is being manufactured in accordance with the London Agreements. To oppose the division of Germany, the German People's Council sent a letter to the Allied Control Council and the commanders of the occupying forces on the 8th, requesting a referendum on the issue of German unification in September. The two-year economic plan for the Soviet occupation zone, proposed by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, has been approved by the Soviet military administration and has been supported by the Congress of Representatives of State-Owned Enterprises and the Federation of Free German Trade Unions.\n    　　　　(IV)\n　　The phased general strike of workers in all industries across the country, led by the Italian General Confederation of Labor, which was of a \"symbolic demonstration\" nature, was completed on schedule from July 2nd to 12th. About six million workers participated in this strike demanding wage increases. The Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labor issued a communique on the 7th, stating that if the attitude of the Industrialists' Association remains stubborn, the General Confederation will consider the possibility of a national general strike when necessary. In order to suppress the burgeoning strike movement in Italy in recent weeks, the Italian government is taking a series of reactionary measures, which have aroused widespread anger among the country's working people. After fierce struggles between the left and right wings, the Italian Socialist Party Congress has adopted a new policy of the so-called \"middle road\" and elected a new executive committee composed entirely of \"centrists.\" However, when the Socialist Party parliamentary group elected its chairman, the Socialist Party parliamentarians, ignoring the opposition of the executive committee, elected the left-wing leader Nenni as chairman by an overwhelming majority.\n    　　　　(V)\n　　After half a month of fierce fighting, the Greek Democratic Army has blocked the largest offensive since the civil war launched by the Royal Fascist Army in the Grammos Mountains in the northern Pindus Mountains. In the regions of Macedonia, Epirus, and Roumeli, the Democratic Army has also launched its own fierce offensives. In June, the Democratic Army killed, wounded, and captured more than 5,000 enemy soldiers.\n    　　　　(VI)\n　　On July 9th, the four-week \"truce\" period in Palestine expired. During the \"truce\" period, the United States and British imperialists instructed the United Nations \"mediator\" Bernadotte to put forward a so-called \"federal\" plan on June 28th, attempting to force the State of Israel to cancel its independence by \"peaceful\" means. The Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out in the Security Council on the 7th that this plan \"is completely incompatible with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 29th last year to divide Palestine into two states, Jewish and Arab.\" The provisional parliament of the State of Israel strongly opposed this plan, and the Israeli government also formally rejected it. Taking advantage of the respite provided by the truce opportunity given by Britain and the United States, the Arab invading forces launched a full-scale offensive against the State of Israel again from July 5th, and the war has been raging throughout Palestine. The main battlefield is in the central area, and the heroic self-defense Israeli army is currently in a superior position and has achieved some major victories.

    "content": "Taihang Xinhua Daily Editorial Calls for\n    Emergency Drought Resistance and Famine Preparation\n    [Taihang Dispatch] The Xinhua Daily here published an editorial entitled \"Take Urgent Action to Launch a Struggle Against Drought and Prepare for Famine,\" which stated: Since the beginning of summer, there has been a prolonged drought with no rain. Throughout the region, except for some areas in the second and third special districts, drought conditions have already formed. In some areas, autumn crops have not been completely sown after the wheat harvest, and in other areas, although they have been sown, the autumn seedlings are obviously suffering from drought and may even wither. Many counties have also discovered locusts and various insect pests. Initially, the masses were anxious and waited for rain, and then actively took action to carry out drought resistance activities. However, some are still waiting. It continued: Our region had a poor harvest last year, and 700,000 people were plunged into famine this spring. Although the spring famine has passed, the summer famine has not completely passed in areas with low wheat production. If drought causes a poor harvest, these areas will fall into continuous famine. We should not passively wait for rain, nor should we rely on heaven for food. We must take active action to fight to overcome the drought. We have already passed Xiaoshu (the 11th solar term), and the season does not allow us to wait. The editorial stated: In areas where drought has already formed, drought resistance and famine preparation should be immediately regarded as the most central work of the great production movement, and the main strength of cadres should be focused on leading the masses to carry out the struggle against drought and famine preparation. In places where locusts are serious, locust control should be treated as the current central work in the same way as drought resistance and famine preparation. We must oppose complacency and waiting in the face of the fight against drought and locusts. The leadership in Shexian, Neiqiu and other places in the first, fifth and sixth special districts has already made such arrangements. This is a correct, timely and appropriate measure. We call on leading cadres at all levels, all party members, and labor heroes to actively lead and promote the masses with their infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, and to complete this urgent and important task. In the specific work of drought resistance and famine preparation, various places have made some achievements. We must draw on our rich historical experience based on the current situation. We must build small-scale water conservancy projects, repair canals and dig wells, and use all possible water to irrigate and protect seedlings. We must carry water to plant seeds, especially to water melons. Our slogan is \"Water as many acres as you can, and keep every plant alive.\" In areas where the above conditions do not exist, dry planting should be advocated, and late seeds such as sorghum, millet, buckwheat, and rapeseed should be prepared. At the same time, wells, kilns, ponds, and dry canals should be repaired to prepare for water storage after rain. We must advocate more hoeing and shallow hoeing to maintain small seedlings. After rain in various places, we must seize the opportunity to plant seeds in a concentrated manner. In places where locusts or other insect pests are found, they must be immediately eliminated. We must carry forward the experience of Shahe and Cixian: \"Come quickly, destroy quickly.\" In these tasks, mutual aid teams and cooperatives should actively participate and give full play to the power of organization. We must call on women, children, and old men to work together to make up for the shortage of main labor. Especially in the first special district, the two tasks of drought resistance and participation in the war are very urgent, and it is even more necessary to give full play to the power of organization. The border areas should unify the struggle against drought, famine preparation, and locust control with the struggle against the enemy. In the process of drought resistance and famine preparation in various places, it is necessary to develop textiles, transportation, and various kinds of sideline production according to the specific circumstances, to earn money to buy food and bran, and to make up for possible poor harvests. All departments of the Party, government, army, and people, and all the masses, must advocate thrift and oppose waste, and resolutely correct the phenomenon of excessive eating and drinking after the wheat harvest.

    "content": "[Taihang Electric] The masses in more than ten counties in the first and second districts of Taihang are heroically and enthusiastically helping the Jinzhong People's Liberation Army in the battle. The number of civilian laborers participating in the war from Wuxiang and Zuoquan counties alone reached 25,000. At the July 1st commemorative meeting in Chengnan Street, Zanhuang, cadres, militiamen, and the masses eagerly signed up to go to the Jinzhong front to participate in the war. Li Kezhi, the leader of the fourth squad of the second battalion of the Wuxiang stretcher team, led his stretcher bearers and, in the battle of Baishen Village, braved the intense strafing of enemy aircraft. Everyone was exceptionally calm and rescued the wounded in a very orderly manner. Battalion Commander Li Youtang and communication soldier Zhang Bohai looked after the wounded all day, feeding them soup and rice. Team member Hao Caiming took out 1,000 yuan (Jicha) to buy eggs for the wounded. Li Wentang, a member of the third squad of the first battalion, braved the rain of bullets on the battlefield to rescue an injured instructor, carrying him to a safe area three miles away. Wang Wenxiu, the leader of the fourth squad of the second battalion of the Zuoquan stretcher team, personally led a platoon back and forth on the front line in the battle of Dongxilang Village, rescuing many wounded soldiers. The troops awarded them fifteen catties of white flour and two packs of cigarettes. War participation model Li Erniu covered the wounded with his own quilt. The civilian laborers accompanying the army from Xiangyuan, Heshun, and Yushe completed the task of transporting the wounded seventy or eighty miles in one go, regardless of fatigue. Cadres of a certain battalion of the Wuxiang Transportation Team took the lead in launching a mutual aid movement, overcoming mountains and valleys, and successfully completed the transportation of grain overnight. The second battalion of the Zuoquan accompanying army stretcher team, in order to save civilian labor, transported ammunition for more than a hundred miles, with an average of four people completing the tasks of five. While civilian laborers accompanying a certain column were transporting ammunition, they encountered rain. The civilian laborers took off their clothes and straw hats to cover the ammunition, ensuring that the ammunition was not damaged in the slightest. Han Zhigui, the leader of the fifth squad of the second battalion of the Wuxiang Transportation Team, and the deputy leader of the sixth squad remained calm and delivered bullets to the soldiers during the intense battle. Li Ergui delivered boxes of artillery shells to the artillerymen until the final victory of the battle. Civilian laborers implemented merit recording and evaluation. The fifth squad of the second battalion of the Wuxiang stretcher team recently conducted a summary. All 169 members of the squad rescued and transported the wounded day and night, without a single person slacking off or running away, and thirty-two models emerged.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 15th: \"If we eliminate Yan Xishan, everything will be ours; if we don't eliminate Yan Xishan, everything will be Yan Xishan's.\" This is the slogan of the people of Jinzhong who have regained liberation to support the People's Liberation Army. The local people are helping the People's Liberation Army solve difficulties with unparalleled enthusiasm and initiative. On the first day that a certain unit entered the Pingchuan area of Jinzhong, supplies were not delivered in time. The masses in nearby villages immediately gathered grain and lent it to the troops. When a certain unit was transferred to accept a combat mission, there was a temporary shortage of grain for dry rations. When the villagers heard about this, they immediately ground flour and made pancakes overnight. A certain village made 1,000 catties of dry rations in the middle of the night and lent them to the troops. An old lady had not yet harvested her wheat, but she immediately told her old man to cut it back, rush to grind it, and make pancakes. She said, \"If we can't supply the troops, we can't eliminate the Gouzi army (referring to the Yan bandits), and the wheat won't be ours either.\" A certain village in Pingyao organized all the people and livestock in the village to push mills, thresh grain, and transport goods day and night, non-stop, and supplied the troops with 2,000 catties of dry rations and flour in one and a half days. Many farmers would rather eat coarse noodles themselves and lend good noodles to the troops, and they automatically supplied the troops with firewood, grass, and animal feed, and organized stretcher teams to transport the wounded. They said, \"Our troops came to fight with food and stretchers, liberating us from the feet of the Gouzi army. If we don't help them a bit, we'll be letting the comrades down!\" The masses were extremely caring for the wounded. After the troops were transferred, the masses in a certain village in Jiexiu automatically hid two wounded soldiers who had fallen behind and carried them back to their original unit. If the troops accidentally forgot something, the masses would immediately find a way to send it back. When the masses in various places heard that the People's Liberation Army was about to pass through, every household prepared relief supplies and boiled mung bean soup to wait for them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行武乡、左权等十余县群众　争赴晋中前线助战  冒弹雨救伤员捎运弹药节省民力\n\n1948-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行武乡、左权等十余县群众\n    争赴晋中前线助战\n    冒弹雨救伤员捎运弹药节省民力\n    【太行电】太行一、二分区十余县群众，英勇热情的帮助晋中人民解放军作战。仅武乡、左权两县参战民工即达两万五千人。赞皇城北街于纪念七一大会上，干部民兵群众争相报名，赶赴晋中前线参战。武乡担架二营四连连长李克志带着担架，在白申村战斗中，冒着敌机猛烈扫射的危险，大家异常镇定，很有秩序的抢救彩号。营长李有堂和通信员张勃孩，整整一天看护着伤员，喂汤喂饭。队员郝才明拿出一千块钱（冀钞，下同）买鸡蛋给彩号吃。一营三连队员李文堂，在战场上冒弹雨抢救一个挂了彩的指导员，一直背到三里以外的安全地带。左权担架二营四连连长王文秀在东西郎村战斗中，亲自带着一排人往返于火线上，抢救了很多彩号，部队特奖给他们十五斤白面，两条纸烟。参战模范李二牛把自己的被子给彩号盖上。襄垣、和顺、榆社的随军民工不顾疲劳，一股劲完成七八十里地转运伤员的任务。武乡运输队某营干部们带头掀起互助运动，爬山越岭，连夜胜利完成运粮。左权随军担架队二营为节省民力，捎运弹药百余里，平均四个人完成五个人的任务。随着某纵队的民工在运弹药途中遇雨，民工纷纷脱下自己的衣服草帽盖住弹药，使弹药未受一点损失。武乡运输队二营五连连长韩指贵和六连副连长在战斗激烈时，仍沉着的往战士跟前送子弹，李二贵把炮弹一箱一箱的送到炮手跟前，直至最后胜利结束战斗。民工们实行了记功评功。武乡担架二营五连于日前进行总结，全连一百六十九人，不分昼夜抢救运送彩号，没有一个人偷懒偷跑，涌现出三十二个模范。\n    【新华社晋绥十五日电】“消灭了阎锡山，什么都是我们的；不消灭阎锡山，什么都是阎锡山的。”这是重获解放的晋中人民支援解放军的口号。当地人民都以无比热情自动的帮助解放军解决困难。某部进入晋中平川的第一天，给养未及时运上，附近各村群众立即凑集粮食借给部队。某部在接受战斗任务转移时，一时缺乏粮食作干粮，村民听到这一情况，立即连夜磨面做饼。某村半夜即做好一千斤干粮借给部队。一位老太太的麦子尚未收回，她立即叫她的老汉去割回赶磨做饼。她说：“供给不了部队，就消灭不了勾子军（指阎匪），麦子也就不是咱们的。”平遥某村把全村人畜力组织起来，推磨、碾场、运输，昼夜不息，一天半即供给部队二千斤干粮和面粉。许多农民宁愿自己吃粗面，把好面借给部队，并自动供给部队柴草畜料及组织担架队转运伤员，他们说：“咱们队伍带着粮食和担架来打仗，把咱们从勾子军脚下解放出来。不帮助些，就对不起同志们啊！”群众对伤员极为爱护。介休某村群众在部队转移后，自动把两个掉队的负伤战士掩蔽起来，抬回原部。部队如偶有遗忘的东西，群众亦立即设法送回。各地群众听见解放军要经过，家家户户都准备慰劳品，烧绿豆汤等候。"

One was destroyed, and the other was still intact. There were also three bunkers on the city tower, and rows of bunkers stretching from the city tower to the southwest corner. The enemy's firepower was intensely blockading the area, and the People's Liberation Army had to climb up the city walls from here to annihilate the enemy.\n    When combat team leader Zhang Minghu was wounded, Li Yuji immediately took over his duties. Carrying six grenades and a rifle, he was the first to climb onto the city wall. Liu Yongfu followed Li Yuji, but as soon as he stepped onto the fourth rung of the ladder, it slipped down the city wall. The enemy concentrated their fire on Li Yuji, who used grenades to repel the enemy in the bunker on the right. He then took cover behind a low wall built by the enemy, using grenades to retaliate against a group of enemies rushing towards him.\n    As Li Yuji threw his fifth grenade, Liu Yongfu also climbed onto the city wall. Huang Benrang was the third to ascend. When he was four or five feet away from the parapet, the ladder slipped again. He held a grenade in his left hand and grabbed the city wall with his right, thinking that he was about to get onto the wall and could not give up even if he died. He hung there for a quarter of an hour before the ladder was set up again and he could climb onto the wall. After Huang Benrang got onto the wall, the ladder slipped down and could not be erected again. Thus, only three soldiers made it onto the west wall of Changli. Grenades were exploding non-stop on the wall. Squad leader Li Zhihe looked at the ladder and then at the sloping outer moat, realizing that there was no way to rely on the ladder. Liu Yongfu picked up the grenades left by the retreating enemy and combined them with his own, totaling nine. Huang Benrang brought eleven more. They relied on these twenty grenades and three rifles to stubbornly repel the enemy's second fierce attack. At this time, the enemy realized the number of PLA soldiers on the wall and launched a third frenzied attack, with a group of enemies also flanking from the right, attempting to attack from both sides. The heroes calmly resisted, and when the enemy advanced into the ditch, a volley of grenades was thrown, and the enemy fell into the ditch and did not move. At this point, the heroes had only two grenades left, one of which was a dynamite grenade. After discussing it, they decided to keep it to use in the most critical moment.\n    Half an hour later, a loud \"boom\" was heard from below the city. The heroes knew it was the sound of explosives, indicating that the city gate had been blown open and the main force was about to come up. Their fighting will became even stronger. Li Yuji fired twenty shots in one breath, blocking the enemy and preventing them from taking another step out of the bunker. They held the breakthrough point as firmly as nails.\n    Soon, figures suddenly appeared on the wall to their left. The main force of the People's Liberation Army had climbed onto the city.

The striking factions include the General Confederation of Labor led by the Communist Party, the \"Workers' Force\" led by the Socialist Party, and the unions affiliated with the Christian Workers' League. \"The strike has cut off all air transport in France, strangled the government's finances, closed the courts in Paris, suspended the national lottery, and threatens to paralyze traffic\" (Associated Press). The strike has also \"affected the Ministries of Interior, Justice, Public Health, and Veterans Affairs, as well as employees in all counties and districts throughout France\" (Associated Press). When the strike began, it was limited to the Ministry of Finance, banks, and tax authorities, but subsequently expanded to other administrative departments. On the 10th, employees of the Ministry of Economy and the Central Administration of National Construction went on strike. That evening, customs officials also went on strike, initially partially, and then completely. After meteorological and telecommunications employees at airports began striking on the evening of the 11th, \"air transport between Paris and other European cities was almost completely cut off\" (Associated Press). The next day, the Ministry of National Economy and central administrative departments also joined the strike. By the evening of the 13th, after employees in all county governments and the Ministries of Interior and Justice throughout France joined the strike, the number of striking employees surged to 1.5 million.

    "content": "A Small Story of Our Army's Mass Discipline in Jinzhong\nAi Chun\n\nThe wheat in Jinzhong was turning yellow, and the people under Yan Xishan's rule saw that the ripe wheat would soon be out of their reach. At this time, a large contingent of the People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared in the vast plains of Jinzhong. A certain unit was assigned to stay in Xujiazhuang, Gaobei, Second District, Qixian County, which had just been liberated.\n\nOn June 19th, the unit received orders from its superiors to depart. Comrades living in the west of the village were boarding up doors, sweeping courtyards, tidying up houses, and returning borrowed items to the people, explaining everything clearly to the masses. Then, they gathered the troops and set off.\n\nThe orderly ranks had just reached the edge of the village when they heard someone chasing after them, crying and shouting. Everyone thought something had happened and stood there stunned. It turned out that the person chasing them was the old landlord in whose house the unit had stayed. The instructor hurried forward to inquire. \"You took more than a foot of my foreign cloth...\" the old man stammered, crying as he spoke. The instructor said, \"Don't cry, fellow villager. If we took it, we guarantee it won't disappear. Sit down, and I'll ask around.\" So he immediately ordered the row of people who had stayed in the old man's house to stop, and one by one, they opened their clothes and backpacks, allowing the old man to personally inspect them. At this time, it started to rain. Seeing that the foreign cloth could not be found, the old man helplessly said, \"Don't check anymore, you hurry up and leave!\" The instructor and the soldiers thought to themselves, this is really strange, how could such a thing happen? The disciplinary education of \"not taking a single needle or thread from the masses\" comrades would not forget! Everyone was uneasy, feeling that this matter concerned the reputation of the People's Liberation Army, and they were all willing to get to the bottom of it. The instructor first ordered the troops to leave, and then said to the old man, \"Fellow villager! Let's go back to your house and search carefully. If we can't find it, we'll compensate you at the price!\" Saying that, the two of them went into the village together, heading towards the old man's residence. They conducted a careful inspection in the room where the soldiers had stayed, but the \"foreign cloth\" was still not found. The old man started crying again. The instructor felt that this place had been severely devastated by Yan Xishan's bandits, the people were very poor, and more than a foot of foreign cloth was a big deal to the old man. He had to get to the bottom of it. Finally, they went to the old man's own north room to search. When the old man personally opened the cabinet, he saw that more than a foot of foreign cloth was lying flat and stable inside. The old man was stunned when he saw the foreign cloth, and became frightened, thinking that he had caused trouble. He was ashamed and afraid, and repeatedly said, \"This is my fault. When you came, I was afraid you would take it, so I hid it here, then forgot, and only said that you took it. This is my mistake...\" At this time, the instructor was not angry at all, but instead smiled and comforted him, saying, \"Fellow villager, don't be afraid, it's good that the thing is found. If it couldn't be found, we would have compensated you. You must know that our People's Liberation Army will not take a single needle or thread from the people...\"\n\nAfterwards, the old man praised the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army everywhere. He constantly told the story of \"the foreign cloth being found\" to the people he knew.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “洋布”找着了　晋中我军群众纪律小故事\n艾纯\n1948-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“洋布”找着了\n    晋中我军群众纪律小故事\n    艾纯\n    晋中的小麦黄了，阎匪统治下的老百姓眼看熟了的麦子将要吃不到了。在这时候解放军大队人马突然出现在晋中广大平川地带，某部被分配住在新解放了的祁县二区郜北徐家庄上。\n    六月十九号，部队接到上级的命令要出发了，住在村西头的同志们有的上门板，有的扫院子，有的收拾屋子，还有的归还借用老百姓的东西，并向群众交代清楚；然后把队伍集合起来，就出发了。\n    整齐的队伍刚走到了村外，只听见后边有人连哭带喊的赶着来了，大家以为出了什么事，都楞在那里。原来追来的就是部队住过的那个房东老汉，指导员忙迎上去向老汉问讯。“你们把我一丈多洋布给拿走了……”老汉吞吞吐吐，边哭边说。指导员说：“老乡不要哭了，要是我们拿了保证没不了你的，你坐下我给你问讯问讯。”于是马上叫在老汉家住的那排人停下来，一个一个的解开衣服背包，叫老汉在跟前亲自来清查验看。这时天下起雨来了，老汉见洋布找不着，没奈何的说：“不要检查了，你们快走吧！”指导员和战士们心里想着，事情真奇怪，怎么会有这样的事情发生？“不拿群众一针一线”的纪律教育同志们不会忘记的啊！大家都不放心，觉得这事情关系到解放军的名誉问题，都愿意闹个清楚明白。指导员先叫队伍走了，然后对老汉说：“老乡！咱再到你家里好好找着，如果找不着我们照价赔给你钱好了！”说着两人一齐进了村，向老汉住的地方走去。他俩在战士住的屋子里进行了仔细的检查，但是“洋布”仍然没有找见，老汉又哭起来。指导员感到这地方被阎匪糟踏的十分厉害，老百姓很穷苦，一丈多洋布对老汉来说能顶大事，一定要弄清楚，最后他们又到老汉自己住的北屋去找，当老汉亲手掀开柜一看，一丈多洋布平平稳稳的在柜里放着。老汉一见洋布也就楞住了，并且害怕起来，心想这可惹出祸事来了。他又羞又怕的连说：“这是我不对，你们来时我怕你们给拿走就藏在这里，后来忘了，只说你们给拿走，这是我的错，……”指导员这时不但毫没动气，反而笑嘻嘻的安慰他说：“老乡，你不要害怕，东西找到就是了，如果找不见的话，咱还要赔偿你的，要知道咱人民解放军是不会拿老百姓一针一线的……。”\n    事后，老汉到处称赞解放军严明的纪律，他不断的把“洋布找着了”的故事，说给他熟识的人们听。"

Li was wounded in the head and cheek during the Kaifeng campaign, but when the company commander was killed and the deputy company commander was wounded, he took over the leadership of the entire company. After the battle ended, he immediately cleaned up weapons on the battlefield, reorganized the unit, and held meetings to prepare for continued combat. During the continuous and urgent marches, his cheek was swollen, but he continued to carry out mobilization and explanation work. He also used the suffering of the common people under the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to educate the soldiers, so the company always maintained high morale. Immediately following the Kaifeng campaign, the company was thrown into the blocking action in Sui (County) and Qi (County) in Eastern Henan, to block the enemy's Qiu Qingquan Corps from reinforcing the Qu Shounian Corps. Li Changcong's wound became inflamed and festered, and he could not eat. However, he only rested in the rear for half a day before rushing back to the front line. On July 1st, the newly appointed company commander was killed in battle. Li Changcong immediately ran around the position, reading party newspapers to the soldiers in the trenches, conveying the Party Committee's call to commemorate \"July 1st.\" He said, \"The Communist Party is born to fight for the people. The bloodshed and sacrifice of revolutionary soldiers are all for the people.\" He called on all party members in the company to commemorate the Party's birthday with a spirit of tenacity, indomitable courage, and heroic fighting, and to avenge the company commander and the sacrificed soldiers. On July 2nd, the enemy's 5th Corps, eager to provide eastern reinforcements, launched an attack on the company's position with superior forces. The company's soldiers continuously inflicted casualties on the enemy. In the heat of battle, by dusk, only a few soldiers remained in the first squad, and six soldiers remained in the second squad. Li Changcong merged the two squads on the battlefield, appointing Wang Jichun, the original second squad leader, as the squad leader, and continued to fight the enemy. He said to Wang Jichun in a serious and passionate tone, \"Remember, you are a Communist Party member. In the most urgent moments of battle, you must resolutely complete the task.\" When the soldiers of the whole company were running out of bullets, Li Changcong immediately ordered: \"Take down the machine guns without bullets, everyone fix bayonets, and annihilate the enemy in front of the position!\" Inspired by his heroic and fearless spirit, the soldiers responded enthusiastically and unanimously, saying, \"Yes! We must hold the position and never retreat a step.\" They persisted until they received the order from their superiors to transfer to rest. After receiving the order, the first squad of the company immediately convened a squad meeting, requesting that they be given the task of continuing to fight.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫东我军某部　嘉奖模范政指李昌从\n\n1948-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫东我军某部\n    嘉奖模范政指李昌从\n    【新华社豫东前线十七日电】解放军某部顷嘉奖在开封、豫东两次战役中模范政工干部四连政治指导员李昌从。李在开封战役中头部及腮部负伤，但当该连连长牺牲、副连长负伤时，他即担任领导全连的工作。战斗告一段落，立即在战地清理武器，整理组织，召开会议，准备继续战斗。在紧急连续的行军中，他的腮已肿起来了，但仍不断地进行动员解释工作。并以眼前所见老百姓遭受蒋匪军的灾害教育战士，所以该连始终保持着高涨的战斗情绪。紧接着开封战役该连又投入豫东睢（县）杞（县）阻击战阻击敌邱清泉兵团东援区寿年兵团时，李昌从的伤口发炎流脓，不能吃饭。但他仅在后方休息了半天，就又奔上火线。七月一日，该连新任连长在战斗中又牺牲了，李昌从即跑遍阵地，在工事里念党报给战士们听，传达党委纪念“七一”的号召，他说：“共产党生来就是为人民战斗的。革命战士们的流血牺牲，都是为了人民。”他号召全连党员，要以顽强不屈、英勇作战的精神来纪念党的生日，为连长及牺牲战士复仇。七月二日，敌整五军为急于东援，以优势兵力向该连阵地进攻，该连战士不断予敌杀伤。激战至黄昏，一班只剩下几个战士，二班剩下六个战士，李昌从就在战地上把两个班合并起来，以原二班长王季春任班长，继续与敌作战。他对王季春严肃而热情的说：“记着，你是共产党员，在战斗最紧急的时候，必须坚决完成任务。”当全连战士们的子弹快打完的时候，李昌从即下令：“把没有子弹的机枪拉下去，每个人上好刺刀，把敌人消灭在阵地前沿！”战士们在他的英勇不怕牺牲的感召下，都热烈的一致响应说：“对！我们要坚守阵地，决不后退一步。”他们一致坚持到接到上级调防休息的命令时止。该连一班在接到命令后立即召开班务会，要求给与继续战斗的任务。"

It had three divisions: the 6th Division, the 13th Division, and the Provisional 4th Division. Later, the 13th Division was exchanged with the 16th Division and belonged to the Sixth War Area under Chen Cheng. In 1943, Liu Jimin served as the army commander, and Shen Chengnian and Wang Zhongzhu served as deputy army commanders. In October 1944, it was reorganized into two divisions, and the Provisional 4th Division was reorganized into a brigade. After Japan's surrender, it was transferred to the Anlu and Yingshan areas to besiege our Central Plains Military Region. After the failure, Liu Jimin was dismissed, and Shen Chengnian was promoted to army commander. In July 1946, it was reorganized into a division, still led by Shen as the division commander, with the 6th Brigade and the 16th Brigade, totaling four regiments. In October 1947, in the Battle of Northern Bo (County), most of its 16th Brigade was annihilated by the Liu-Deng army. After reorganization and the supplementation of a large number of new recruits, each brigade was restored to a three-regiment system (the 6th Brigade had the 16th, 17th, and 18th Regiments, and the 16th Brigade had the 46th, 47th, and 48th Regiments). It frequently collaborated with Chiang Kai-shek's 5th Army to invade our liberated areas of Southwestern Shandong, East China, and Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu. Later, it was under the command of the 5th Army. Recently, it formed the 7th Army Corps with the 72nd Reorganized Division and the New 21st Brigade. The commander of this army corps was concurrently held by Qu Shounian, the deputy commander of the Sixth Pacification Zone, who was captured this time. (2) The New 21st Brigade was originally the New 21st Division of the Sichuan Army. In 1946, it was reorganized into a brigade, with the 61st and 63rd Regiments under its command, and belonged to the 88th Division. In the Battle of Yutai and Jinxiang last year, our Liu-Deng army completely annihilated its 63rd Regiment. Later, it was supplemented by two battalions of new recruits from the local security forces and changed its designation to the 147th Brigade. In mid-April of this year, the 88th Division was reorganized into a garrison division, and the New 21st Brigade was changed to an independent brigade, placed under the command of the 75th Division, and restored to a three-regiment system, with the 61st, 62nd, and 63rd Regiments under its command.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫东被歼敌军介绍　整七十五师及新廿一旅\n\n1948-07-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫东被歼敌军介绍\n    整七十五师及新廿一旅\n    【新华社豫东前线十六日电】此次在豫东睢杞战役中被全歼的蒋军整七十五师及新二十一旅介绍：（一）七十五师在整编前为七十五军，首任军长周＠。辖六师、十三师、预四师三个师。后十三师与十六师对调，属六战区陈诚序列。一九四三年柳际明任军长，沈澄年、王中柱任副军长。一九四四年十月整编为两个师，预四师编为旅。日本投降后调至安陆、应山一带围攻我中原军区。失败后，柳际明被撤职，沈澄年升任军长。一九四六年七月整编为师，仍由沈任师长，辖六旅、十六旅共四个团。一九四七年十月在亳（县）北战役中，其十六旅大部被刘邓大军歼灭。经休整并补充大量新兵后，各旅恢复为三团制（六旅辖十六、十七、十八团，十六旅辖四十六、四十七、四十八团），经常协同蒋匪第五军进犯我鲁西南、华东及豫皖苏等解放区。后属第五军建制。最近与整七十二师、新二十一旅组成第七兵团，该兵团由此次被俘的第六绥区副司令区寿年兼任兵团司令。（二）新二十一旅为原川军新二十一师。一九四六年整编为旅，辖六十一、六十三两个团，属八十八师建制。去年鱼台、金乡一战，我刘邓大军全歼其六十三团，后以新兵地方保安队两个大队补充，变更番号为一四七旅。今年四月中旬，八十八师改编为警备师，新二十一旅被改为独立旅，归七十五师指挥，并恢复为三团制，辖六十一团、六十二团、六十三团。"

It is surrounded by gullies on three sides and leans against a mountain on one side. It directly controls the important town of Zihong, the Changyuan River, and the Baijin Road below the ridge. It is located at the throat of Shangdang entering central Shanxi, with a strategically important position. It was the barrier for the Yan bandit [Yan Xishan] to control Tai(yuan) and Qi(xian). The Yan bandits built two large \"plum blossom\" blockhouses, each over three zhang high, and three \"plum blossom\" large bunkers on the mountain, surrounded by dense small bunkers, all made of steel and concrete. There were three outer trenches outside the large blockhouses: the first was a five-meter-high sloping cut (i.e., trench) with obstacles like chevaux de frise set up on the trench; the second was a widened communication trench made of accumulated soil; and the third was a seven-meter-wide outer trench. The firepower between the bunkers intersected to form a fire network. The Yan bandits themselves called this White Lion Ridge the impregnable \"King Kong Ridge.\" On the evening of June 30, a unit of the People's Liberation Army attacked White Lion Ridge. The troops were moving tensely day and night, and the artillerymen were carefully correcting their artillery positions on the position. The phone in the command post was busy all night. At five o'clock the next morning, the order to attack was issued from the phone at the command post. One after another, cannonballs heavily hit the Yan bandit's blockhouse complex on the top of the ridge, with bricks, tiles, and wood rising into the air, and obstacles and dust flying everywhere. Two hours passed, and almost all the large and small blockhouses made of steel and concrete had been destroyed, revealing many gaps in the communication trenches. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the infantry immediately began to charge. Wang Wanshun, the squad leader of the fifth squad of the eighth company of a certain unit, led his assault team, using grenades to defeat the enemy's resistance, broke through the obstacles in six minutes, and occupied the first blockhouse. Comrade Ren Guowang of the second echelon of the squad followed up, and one person set up a ladder weighing more than ninety pounds that required two people to carry. Our subsequent troops continued to charge up and launched a fierce battle for the blockhouses. The sound of artillery fire shook the banks of the Changyuan River, and the smoke of gunpowder covered White Lion Ridge. Despite the enemy's planes constantly circling overhead, dropping bombs, and strafing, under the heroic attack and coordinated actions of our infantry and artillery, after six and a half hours of fierce fighting, the Yan bandits finally could not save the destruction of their \"King Kong Ridge.\" The defending enemy, the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the Thirty-seventh Division of the Yan bandits, perished with it.

    "content": "【Taihang Electric】After the liberation of Yuantai沟(Gou) and Liang Village in the second district of Qixian County, the masses have successively complained to our army about the暴行(Baoxing - brutal acts) of the阎(Yan) bandits, who made it impossible for the people to survive with the \"integration of soldiers and farmers\" and苛捐杂税(Kejuanzashui - exorbitant taxes and levies). In May of last year, when the阎(Yan) bandits扎(Zha - stationed) a stronghold in Yuantai沟(Gou), the disaster of苛捐杂税(Kejuanzashui - exorbitant taxes and levies) and extortion immediately descended upon the masses in these villages. Liang Village has nearly 300 households. Within a few months of the bandits' occupation, in addition to temporary apportionments, the formal grain and silver burden alone amounted to 98,800斤(Jin - a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 500 grams) of rice and wheat. The conversion method stipulated by the阎(Yan) bandits was based on wheat as the standard: one stone of wheat was equivalent to 1.3 stone of rice, 2.9 stone of sorghum, 2.3 stone of corn, and 2.19斗(Dou - a Chinese unit of dry volume) of beans. After the farmers handed over all their harvests as public grain, very little was left; plus the temporary apportionments for grass and fodder, village office expenses, the allowances for the village head, secretary,乡地(Xiangdi - village police), and ten other people (more than six stone of rice per month), and the numerous苛捐杂税(Kejuanzashui - exorbitant taxes and levies), all the grain was paid and it was still not enough. Many people therefore fled to other villages. The burden on the people was too heavy, and most of the land was barren. Even if they could not harvest grain, they still had to bear the burden, making it even more difficult for the farmers to survive. Zhao福元(Fuyuan), a farmer in the village, had a family of nine, with two members participating in our army, and planted more than 50 acres of land (including 20 acres planted with others). Last year, he harvested more than 50 stone of coarse grain, but was forced to pay a burden of 3,700斤(Jin - a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 500 grams), plus more than three stone of \"preferential treatment against the enemy\" extorted from the families of the Liberation Army. Other sporadic payments are not included. Old man 福光(Fuguang) said: \"If our Eighth Route Army hadn't saved some grain, the whole family would have starved to death.\" Once, the enemy, under the pretext of going to Taiyuan to repair roads, ordered the conscription of laborers, each of whom had to bring 40 days' worth of grain. When the masses went, all the grain they brought was confiscated, the roads were not repaired, and the people were all driven back. The 19th Army of the阎(Yan) bandits robbed everywhere: an old man in Yuantai沟(Gou) hid his only one斗(Dou - a Chinese unit of dry volume) of rice in more than a dozen places, but it was found and robbed by the enemy. Old man Zhao培天(Peitian) in Liang Village said: The enemy's burden rises every month and is demanded every day. Any delay is considered a \"装分子(Weizhuang fenzi - disguised element)\" and punished with \"乱棍打死(Luan gun da si - beaten to death with random sticks).\" Zhao福光(Fuguang) said: \"Grain and money are征(Zheng - requisitioned) at every turn. It costs 30,000 yuan to get a pass from the village office, and later it was raised to 50,000.\" After the閻(Yan) bandits implemented the so-called \"patriotic and people-loving\" \"integration of soldiers and farmers\" and \"distribution according to labor\" in December last year, the masses complained even more. Men aged 16 to 48 in the village were all organized into groups of three, each person was allocated a share of land, ranging from 30 to 40 acres (depending on the average number of laborers and land in the village). In Liang Village, each share was 32 acres, one of whom was a regular soldier, detached from production, and the other two were National soldiers and militia, farming at home. With few people and much land, they could not cultivate it, and most of the land was barren, with grass growing three or four尺(Chi - a Chinese unit of length, approximately 1/3 of a meter) high. The grain harvested throughout the year had to yield 3.75 stone of wheat for every two silver coins of grain (four silver coins of grain per share of land), and the regular soldier had to be given 7.5 stone. Women, children, and old men who were not of age were not allocated land at all. If there were no men of age in the family, the land was confiscated and distributed, and the family could only maintain their livelihood by borrowing land from others, but the burden still had to be paid in full. In Yuantai沟(Gou), more than half of the 60 households in the village had no land. A folk song is widely circulating among the masses: \"The 'treasure bowl' of combined soldiers and farmers, gathering and gathering, but no one left.\" Before the liberation of this area, the enemy ordered the征(Zheng - requisition) of wheat just before the wheat harvest. Liang Village planted more than 270 acres of wheat, and each acre could only harvest an average of six or seven斗(Dou - a Chinese unit of dry volume), but the閻(Yan) bandits sent more than 300 stone at once. Yuantai沟(Gou) had 80 to 90 acres of wheat, which could harvest at most 80 to 90 stone, but the閻(Yan) bandits actually sent 200 stone. The masses felt that even if they harvested all the wheat, it would not be enough to pay the grain, and were forced to ask to hand over all the wheat to the enemy to harvest. Fortunately, our army liberated the area at this time, and immediately abolished all the slave systems of the閻(Yan) bandits. Now the masses are rejoicing in the wheat harvest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 兵农合一“聚宝盆”，聚来聚去没有人！　祁县农民控诉阎匪\n\n1948-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　兵农合一“聚宝盆”，聚来聚去没有人！\n  　祁县农民控诉阎匪\n    【太行电】祁县二区元台沟、梁村一带解放后，群众纷纷向我军控诉阎匪以“兵农合一”和苛捐杂税，害得人民无法生存的暴行。去年五月阎匪在元台沟扎下据点，苛捐杂税及勒索掠夺的灾害，随即降临到这些村庄群众的头上。梁地将近三百户，匪占后数月内，除临时各种摊派外，仅正式粮银负担即达米麦九万八千八百斤。阎匪规定的折合办法系以小麦为标准，石麦折米石三，折高粱两石九，折玉茭两石三，折豆子两石一斗九。农民全部收获缴了公粮，所余已经无几；加上临时摊派的草料费、村公所办公费、村长、书记、乡地（村警）等十个人的津贴费（每月六石多米），以及名目繁多的苛捐杂税，全部粮食扫数缴了还不够。很多人因此逃往外村。民力担负过重，土地大部荒芜，打不上粮食也得出负担，农民更加难以过活。该村农民赵福元家九口人，两个参加我军，种着五十多亩地（内伴种别人廿亩），去年打了五十多石粗粮，即被迫缴纳负担三千七百斤，还有三石多向解放军家属额外勒索的“抗优待”。其他零星派款还不在内。福光老汉说：“如果不是咱八路军在时积存下些粮食，全家人都会饿死。”有一次敌以到太原修路为名，下令召集民工，每人须带四十天粮食。群众去了，带的粮食全被没收，路也不修，把人全赶回来。阎匪十九军到处乱抢：元台沟一个老汉把仅有的一斗米分散放在十几个地方，也被敌找见抢走了。梁村赵培天老汉说：敌人的负担是月月起，天天要，稍有迟慢，就以“伪装分子”论罪，“乱棍打死”。赵福光说：“动不动就征粮款，到村公所开个路条还要三万元，后来又涨成五万”。去年腊月阎匪实行所谓“爱国爱民”的“兵农合一”、“按劳分配”后，群众更叫苦连天。村里十六至四十八岁男人都编成三人一组，每人分一份土地，每份三、四十亩不等（根据全村劳力与土地数平均而定）。梁村每份卅二亩，其中一人为常备兵，脱离生产，两人为国民兵与民卫军，在家种地。人少地多，种不过来，土地大部荒芜，草长三、四尺。全年所收粮食，每两银粮得出三石七斗五的麦子（每一份地四两银粮），还得给常备兵七石五。妇女儿童与不在年龄的老汉根本不分土地。家里没有在年龄的男人，土地即被没收分配，全家生活只能借种别人土地维持，但负担仍得如数交纳。元台沟全村六十多户，有二分之一都没有土地。群众普遍流行着一个民谣：“兵农合一聚宝盆，聚来聚去没有人。”该地解放前，麦收将至，敌即下令征收。梁村共种二百七十多亩麦，每亩平均只能收六、七斗，阎匪一次就派了三百多石。元台沟八九十亩麦，最多打八九十石，阎匪竟派了二百石。群众感到全部收下也不够交粮，被迫要求把全部麦子一根不动的交给敌人去收。适于此时我大军解放该地，立即废除了阎匪一切奴隶制度，现群众正欢欣麦收中。"

According to telephone and written reports received by the Fourth Administrative Office, as of the evening of the 13th of this month, among the nine counties in the entire special district, except for some areas of Quyang County where there was penetrating rain, the northwestern mountainous areas of Jianping County, and Fuping County where there were two or three finger-lengths of rain, the remaining counties had not received rain for more than a month. (At the time of publication, Fuping had heavy rain, details unknown.) In Jianping, the willows on the river beaches west of Hongzidian were so dry that many were losing their leaves. Many places have also suffered from wind, hail, and insect disasters, with hail being the most severe. According to preliminary statistics from Jingxing, Lingshou, Xingtang, Fuping, and Zhengding counties, the number of villages affected by the disaster reached 202. In Xingtang County, 80 out of 306 villages were hit by hail, accounting for a quarter of all villages. According to the county magistrate's report, the hail that fell on the 30th of last month caused severe damage to crops. In Zhengding, the hail disaster on the 30th of last month left the cotton plants bare and the melons and vegetables completely destroyed in more than a dozen villages such as Luojiazhuang in the Fifth District. Jianping and Xingtang suffered wind disasters, and the losses are temporarily uncalculated. The areas known to be affected by locusts include a small part of the Second District of Huolu, twelve villages in the Seventh District, three villages in the Eighth District, and parts of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts of Pingshan. In Sanchang area of Xingtang, a kind of pest called \"black helmet\" was found, which is very harmful to crops. The above areas have basically been wiped out after mobilizing the masses to catch and kill locusts. However, the locust eggs have not been completely eliminated, and the locust plague may still rise again, which should arouse the vigilance of all localities. According to people familiar with agricultural affairs, even if it rains now, most of the drought-stricken corn will not be harvested and must be uprooted and replanted with other late autumn crops. In the face of the serious drought, the Fourth District Committee and the Fourth Administrative Office of the CCP North Yue have issued an emergency drought resistance and famine preparedness instruction a few days ago, and have distributed the several thousand dan of production and disaster relief loan grain re-issued by the North Yue Administrative Office to the districts and villages that are more severely affected, and have drawn important cadres, led by Commissioner Cui Minsheng himself, to go to Zhengding, Xingtang, Jingxing and other counties to specifically lead the drought resistance and disaster relief work.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Zhan Chao)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳四专员　下乡领导抗旱救灾\n展潮\n1948-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳四专员\n  　下乡领导抗旱救灾\n    【本报讯】入夏以来，北岳四专区苦旱之余，又遭风、雹、虫灾，情况相当严重。据四专署所获电话与书面报告，截至本月十三日晚全专区九个县，除曲阳县一部地区下透雨、建屏县西北部山地及阜平县下二三指雨外，其余县份一个多月均未落雨。（发稿时阜平已降大雨，详情未悉。）建屏洪子店河西滩杨柳，很多都旱得落叶了。许多地方又发生风灾、雹灾与虫灾，其中尤以雹灾为重。据井陉、灵寿、行唐、阜平、正定五县初步统计，受灾村庄达二○二个。行唐全县三○六村，有八十村遭雹灾，占全部村庄四分之一。据该县县长报告：上月卅日所下冰雹，使庄稼受损害甚重。正定上月三十日一次雹灾，把五区罗家庄等十几个村庄的棉花都打成光棍，瓜菜也全部砸烂。建屏、行唐遭受风灾，损失一时尚无统计。蝗虫为害地区，已知者有获鹿二区小部、七区十二个村、八区三个村，平山三区、四区、五区各一部。行唐四常一带，发现一种叫黑宝盖的害虫，吃庄稼很厉害。以上地区经发动群众捕打蝗虫基本已被扑灭。但蝗卵尚未肃清，虫患仍有复起可能，亟应引起各地警惕。据熟悉农事者谈：现在即使下了雨，受旱之玉蜀黍大部已无收成，须拔去补种其他晚秋作物。面临着严重的旱灾，中共北岳四地委、四专署已于日前发出紧急抗旱备荒指示，将北岳行署补发的几千石生产救灾贷粮，有重点地分配到受灾较重的区村，并抽出重要干部，由崔民生专员亲自带领，分赴正定、行唐、井陉等县具体领导抗旱救灾工作。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（展潮）"

The textiles loaned to disaster victims in the first and second districts for transportation and sales were bought with rice by the county promotion cooperative. According to their experience, it is best to lend the masses the physical goods they need.\" However, according to another report I received: \"Tang County's first and second districts have suffered from consecutive years of drought and are the key areas for loans. The county promotion cooperative turned grain loans into textiles, loaning them to the masses for transportation and sales in Chahar and Yanbei, and organized the loan households into groups of six. As a result, Wangzhen Village lost money. Some borrowers even took the textiles to Zhuanlu (a market town not far from Tang County) to sell. Because they exchanged grain for textiles, the price of grain rose, and the county production promotion cooperative lost more than 10 million border currency.\"\n\n　　Although the principles and experiences of providing grain loans and loans, organizing the masses to produce and overcome famine, making things as convenient as possible for the masses, and lending the masses the physical goods they need are all correct. However, judging from the facts reported by the two sides, the discrepancies are very large. I am writing to request that you continue to investigate and clarify the truth.

According to a report in the Tianjin New Star newspaper on the 9th of last month, describing the miserable lives of people in the Chiang-controlled areas around Haizhou, northern Jiangsu: In and out of Haizhou and Guanyun cities, starving people are collapsing on the roads every day; even more are starving to death at home. A teacher surnamed Wu in Haizhou, along with his family of six, committed suicide by taking poison because they could not bear the hunger. Selling children is happening everywhere, especially in Xinpu. A child around ten years old is priced at 100,000 to 150,000 Chiang currency, which is equivalent to the price of a few pounds of corn (at that time, corn sold for 5 million per shi), with straw markers stuck in their hair, led by their parents while crying and shouting, but there are many sellers and very few buyers. It is also learned that since shortly after the autumn harvest last year, riots of rice looting have continuously broken out in Xinpu, Haizhou, Guanyun, and Lianyungang and other places. According to the newspaper: Dozens or hundreds of starving people have repeatedly robbed grain shops in Xinpu; in Banpu and other places, starving people are grabbing food on the streets and alleys every day, saying, \"If we don't rob, we will starve to death anyway!\" Even the Chiang's police are helpless. According to the newspaper, the Chiang bandit gang, in its narrow-controlled area, has stationed an entire 44th Division, a salt affairs tax police regiment of about 6,000 people, and the Home Return Corps and other local troops, demanding grain and grass from the starving people on their last breath. \"As soon as the township and village chiefs' apportionment list comes out, men and women cry, and even if they don't have money, they have to pay.\" The burden is heavy, and the area planted with wheat is less than half. Now that the new wheat has not yet come on the market, the Chiang government has already decided on the first wheat levy, uniformly collecting 14 catties per mu.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Brief News on Industry and Commerce in the Chiang Area:\n    △ Tianjin Dagongbao reported: Tianjin's private machine industry originally had over a thousand firms, but due to poor business, by April of this year, only about a hundred remained, and most of them were in a state of shutdown. The city's private rubber industry had a total of sixty-two factories, and production generally declined sharply. Taking the larger Yuhua and Zhenzhong factories as examples, the two factories had a total of four hundred workers and could each produce 1,200 sets of inner and outer tires per day, not to mention other rubber shoes, etc., and had an attached iron factory. However, from the summer of last year to May of this year, the two factories, due to business difficulties, successively reduced their business scope and merged into one factory, with only one hundred workers left. The daily output plummeted to 300-400 sets of inner and outer tires each, and the attached iron factory was completely shut down.\n    △ According to Jinan's \"North China News\" on May 16th: In Jinan, more than 300 businesses closed down voluntarily in April due to heavy taxes and poor business, including more than 100 grain businesses, more than 100 oil businesses, and more than 100 flour businesses.\n    △ Shanghai Dagongbao reported on May 24th: Under the assault of the economic storm, Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company declared bankruptcy on May 24th due to sluggish business. It is reported that the company is one of the top ten shipping companies in the Chiang area, with more than 10,000 tons of ocean-going vessels.\n    △ Tianjin Xin Xing Bao continuously disclosed on June 10th and 11th: The Tianjin East Railway Station authorities recently used the excuse of \"unified inspection\" to force all transported goods to pay a \"transfer fee\" starting from the 8th. It is calculated that each item of goods weighing 60 kilograms or less would be charged 25,000 yuan, and the amount would increase up to 100,000 yuan. The city's contracting and transportation industry, unable to withstand the exploitation, has protested to the Chiang authorities for days. The railway bureau was forced to slightly reduce the amount to be paid. The industry is still continuing to protest, demanding the complete cancellation of this unreasonable exploitation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 天津民营机器工业破产过去千多家现仅存百余　蒋区工商业简讯\n\n1948-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　天津民营机器工业破产过去千多家现仅存百余\n  　蒋区工商业简讯\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】蒋区工商业简讯：\n    △天津大公报载：天津民营机器工业原有一千余家，因营业不振，至本年四月间已仅剩百余家，且其中多陷停工状态。该市民营橡胶业共有六十二家工厂，产量亦普遍锐减，以较大的钰华、震中为例，两厂共有工人四百人，每天各能生产内外胎各一千二百付，其他胶鞋等尚不计在内，并附设有一铁工厂；但自去年夏季直到今年五月间，该二厂即因营业困难，先后缩减业务范围，合并为一厂，工人只剩一百人，每天产量激降至内外胎各三、四百付，附设之铁工厂则完全停业。\n    △据济南“华北新闻”五月十六日披露：济南商号于四月份因苛捐繁重，营业不振而自动歇业者达三百余家之多，内包括粮业、油业各百余家，面粉等百余家。\n    △沪大公报五月二十四日讯：在经济风暴袭击下，上海华商轮船公司因营业清淡，已于五月二十四日宣告倒闭。按该公司为蒋区十大轮船公司之一，拥有海轮万余吨。\n    △天津新星报六月十、十一日连续披露：天津东火车站当局近假借“统一检查”借口，于八日起，强迫所有运输货物缴纳“转搬费”，计每件货物六十公斤以下者勒收二万五千元，以次增加至十万元不等。该市承揽运输业以不堪榨取，连日向蒋记当局提出抗议，将记铁路局被迫将缴额稍稍减低，该业现仍继续抗争，要求完全取消此项无理剥削。"

In January, over 2,500 shi of millet were transported to Yangcheng. Because the leadership did not inspect the work on a regular basis, they did not know which warehouses had grain or not, nor the quality of the grain. During the grain transport, they were unable to grasp the warehouse situation, and all the transported grain was bad, unable to be eaten or preserved. The long-distance transport of hundreds of miles wasted a lot of people's labor. Recently, grain was again transported to × county, allocating 23 large carts. Upon arrival at × village, there was no grain in the warehouse. A chaotic search ensued, wasting two days and a great deal of people's labor, with 46 workers alone. Therefore, the Taiyue Administrative Office, in its circular, criticized the Tunliu County Government for managing the people's property with a careless and bureaucratic attitude, wasting people's labor, and damaging the people's interests. It called on every finance and grain cadre to cherish revolutionary property and people's labor, and to stand firmly at their posts, serving the people wholeheartedly.\n    [Taihang News] The Finance Section of the Sixth Special District of Taihang, when reviewing the June final accounts, discovered that the Sixth Joint Middle School had falsely reported 88 days of vacation for publicly funded students, and over-reported 3,818 jin of grain and vegetable money converted to rice. The cadre training class attached to the school also over-reported 1,608 jin of wheat in June. The Special District Finance Section, upon discovering this problem, immediately sent people to the school to check the accounts. They found that the school had consistently been reporting expenses based on the established number of personnel, not according to the actual number of people, falsely reporting and creating fictitious publicly funded positions. After the reorganization, opposing false reporting and fictitious reporting was proposed, and the school only calculated according to the actual number of people and days from January to May of this year. In June, they began to undermine the system again, damaging the interests of the public and satisfying the selfish interests of the small collective. This kind of undisciplined behavior should be resolutely opposed, and the person in charge of the school should conduct a strict self-examination.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Zhihua, Qishu, Finance Section of the Sixth Special District of Taihang Area)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 官僚主义浪费民力　屯留财政科受到严厉批评　太行第六联中　虚报人数受检举\n\n1948-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　官僚主义浪费民力\n  　屯留财政科受到严厉批评\n  　太行第六联中\n  　虚报人数受检举\n    【太岳电】太岳行署于本月十二日通令各专署县府，指责屯留县政府财政科因官僚主义作风，造成两次运粮浪费民力的现象。一月份往阳城送小米两千五百余石，因领导上平日对工作不加检查，不知道哪个仓库有粮无粮，也不知道粮食好坏。运粮时无法掌握仓库情况，运去的都是坏粮，既不能吃，更不能保存，数百里长途运输浪费了很多民力。最近又往×县运粮，拨去二十三辆大车，到了×村，仓库里都没有粮食，到处乱找，误了两天时间，浪费民力甚多，只工人就有四十六个。因此太岳行署在通令中指责屯留县府用马虎从事、官僚主义的态度管理人民财产，浪费民力，损害人民利益的现象。并号召每个财粮干部，必须很好的爱护革命财产，爱惜民力，很好的站在自己的岗位上，全心全意为人民服务。\n    【太行讯】太行六专署财政科在审查六月份决算时，发现第六联中虚报公费生假期天数八十八天，多报食粮、菜金折米三千八百十八斤。在该校附设的干训班六月份亦多报销麦子一千六百零八斤。专署财政科发现了这个问题，立即派人前赴该校检查帐目，发现该校去年一贯是按编制人数报销，不按实有人数计算，虚报、空报公费名额。自整编后，提出反对虚报、空报，该校今年一月至五月份才依实有人数天数计算。到六月份，又开始破坏制度，损害大公家利益，满足小公家的私利。这种目无纪律的行为应当坚决反对，该校负责人应作严格检查。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（太行区第六专财政科志华、其恕）"

    "content": "Pingshan Relaxes Production Leadership, Drought Relief Work Falls into Drift\n    [This newspaper dispatch] Our reporter's exclusive interview: Pingshan County, which suffered a poor harvest last year, has experienced a month without rain since a heavy rain in early June this year. The drought is gradually forming and becoming more serious. According to Yu Conglong, a 72-year-old man working in the Industry Department of the Pingshan County Government, who has lived such a long life and repaired canals for most of his life, he has never seen the Ye River run out of water. The ten canals along the river always maintain a full water supply. The situation has changed this year. The water level in the Heguangtan and Gongsuntan canals has dropped by two-thirds. Sixty-one hectares of land in the ten villages along the river are difficult to irrigate, and 36 hectares of paddy fields are even more threatened. The Hutuo River, which runs sixty miles across the county, still had one or two feet of water at its driest last year, but this year there is only residual water in some places. Before the water rose on the 6th and 7th of this month (due to rain in other counties), some rice seedlings in Zhuhe Village, Sixth District, which is adjacent to the river, had already died from drought. In Tianxing Village, Second District, more than 30 mu of land were left unplanted after the wheat harvest due to lack of water. Of the 132,200 mu of paddy fields in the county, about one-tenth are irrigated by wells. This year, the water level in the wells has plummeted, and watering has often been forced to stop. The masses are extremely anxious and at a loss.\n    In order to understand the overall situation, the reporter recently visited County Magistrate Zhang and asked about the county's measures for drought resistance and famine preparation. According to County Magistrate Zhang, they initially underestimated the severity of the drought. It was not until he went to the Hutuo River to resolve water disputes and personally saw the severity of the drought that he issued instructions for an \"emergency mobilization to resist drought and prepare for famine.\" He also sent special personnel to the Hutuo River and Ye River canals to help the masses adjust water volume, which was quite effective. In order to urgently save the 36 hectares of paddy fields in the Gongsuntan and Heguangtan basins, the county government's Industry Department and Production Promotion Society twice sent people to convene the canal affairs committee members of Yuanquan, Minsheng, Shimen, Xingsheng and other canals to discuss water volume adjustment. After mobilization and persuasion, the above canals agreed to release 20% of their water volume to the Gongshun and Heguang canals, and the 36 hectares of paddy fields were finally saved. He said that there are no specific measures for drought resistance in the dry land, which accounts for more than 72% of the county's cultivated land. He said that the main difficulty is the lack of personnel (at present, all county, district and work team cadres, except for a very small number of secretaries, assistants and other cadres who are left to handle wheat requisition and other matters, are concentrated in the county to engage in ideology and have been in meetings for more than a month, and are currently still in the leadership inspection stage), which has caused the entire drought resistance and production work to fall into a state of drift. The masses are very anxious and cannot get strong leadership. Many villages and townships have to ask the \"Dragon King\" for rain, and some are waiting for relief. County Magistrate Zhang said that he has proposed to the relevant responsible parties more than once to send cadres to the countryside to engage in production and drought resistance work, but there have been no results for half a month. Some cadres are sporadically dispatched to the countryside during the study, and the focus is only on summer requisition. The reporter also visited Comrade Zhang Shilin, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee. Comrade Zhang said that he had studied it a few days ago, issued an instruction, and planned to study this work specifically in a few days. The reporter also visited Comrade Hu Kaiming, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee. Comrade Hu said that he had mentioned it to the County Party Committee, but there was not much improvement. The reporter believes that facing such a serious drought, the Pingshan County Party Committee's initial lack of attention to drought resistance has caused some losses. Although some work was later done (such as adjusting water conservancy, issuing drought prevention and famine preparation instructions, etc.), there was a lack of strong leadership and organizational guarantees. The main reason is that some comrades in the County Party Committee have subjectively relaxed production leadership, believing that the masses will engage in production themselves. Therefore, under the circumstances that the drought is developing more and more, the masses are ideologically confused, and they universally demand leadership in drought resistance and famine preparation, they are still divorced from the masses' current biggest demand and concentrate cadres to hold meetings to engage in ideology. This is a practice divorced from the masses. If this continues, it will cause the disaster to spread further and cause greater difficulties in people's lives. It is recommended that the Pingshan County Party Committee and the government quickly organize all forces to lead the masses to vigorously resist drought and prepare for famine.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Zhan Chao)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平山放松生产领导抗旱工作陷于自流\n展潮\n1948-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平山放松生产领导抗旱工作陷于自流\n    【本报讯】总分社记者专访：去年曾是歉年的平山县，今年自六月初旬下过一次大雨后，一月无雨，旱象逐渐形成，日趋严重。据平山县政府实业科工作的一位七二老人于从龙谈他活了这么大岁数，修了多半辈子渠，从未见冶河缺过水，沿河十条渠总是经常保持饱满水。今年的情况变了。和公滩与公顺滩两渠现下水位降落三分之二，沿河十个村庄有六十一顷地已难灌溉，其中三十六顷稻田更受威胁。横贯县境六十里的滹沱河，去年最旱时仍有一、二尺水，今年最旱时有些地方已仅余碛水。本月六、七日水涨（其他县份得雨）前，挨着河的六区朱河村，有些稻苗已旱死。二区田兴村麦收后，因缺水未种的白地有三十多亩。全县十三万二千余亩水地中，约有十分之一是井浇地，今年井水水位暴降，浇地时常常被迫中止。群众异常焦急，束手无策。\n    记者日前为了解全面情况，走访该县张县长，询问县上对于抗旱备荒的措施。据张县长谈：他们开始对旱情严重程度估计不足，直到日前他去滹沱河边解决水利纠纷，亲自看到旱象十分严重，方才发出“紧急动员起来抗旱备荒”的指示。并派专人至滹沱河、冶河各渠，帮助群众调剂水量，颇获成效。为急救公顺滩与和公滩流域三十六顷稻田，县府实业科、生产推进社曾两次派人召集源泉、民生、石门、兴胜等渠的渠务委员，商讨调剂水量。经过动员说服，以上几渠同意各让十分之二的水量给公顺、和公两渠，三十六顷稻田终得救活。他说：占全县可耕地面积百分之七十二还多的旱地如何抗旱，尚无具体措施。他说：主要的困难是没有人（现各区除留极少数秘书、助理员等干部处理麦征等事外，全体县区及工作团干部都集中在县里搞思想，开会已经月余，目前仍停留在检查领导阶段），致使整个抗旱生产工作陷于自流。群众很急焦又得不到有力的领导，不少村乡只好向“龙王”去求雨，有的人则等待救济。张县长说：他曾不止一次向有关负责方面提议：抽派干部下乡搞生产抗旱工作，至今半月尚无结果，在学习中零星抽派一些干部下乡，重点也只是为了夏征。记者又访问该县县委副书记张士林同志，张同志说：几天前研究过，发了个指示，准备过几天专门研究这个工作。记者又走访地委副书记胡开明同志，胡同志说：他曾向县委提过，但也没有多少改进。记者认为面临这么严重的旱灾，平山县委会开始对抗旱重视不足，已造成某些损失，后来虽然作了部分工作（如调剂水利、发出防旱备荒指示等），但缺乏强有力领导和组织保证。主要原因是县委会中某些同志，主观上放松了生产领导，认为群众自己会搞生产，因而在旱灾日益发展、群众思想迷惘、普遍要求领导抗旱备荒的情况下，仍然脱离群众当前最大要求，集中干部开会去搞思想，这是一种脱离群众的做法，长此下去，将使灾害更加蔓延，造成人民生活中更大的困难。建议平山县委和政府迅速组织一切力量领导群众大力抗旱备荒。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（展潮）"

    "content": "Huabei Frontline, 17th Telegraph: A unit of the People's Liberation Army in North China is currently conducting a widespread \"Soldier Acting as Soldier\" movement. Under the planned organization of the leadership, soldiers themselves are arranging and performing, to achieve self-education, self-improvement. This has become one of the working methods of the mass line in military and political work, creating a new direction for mass literary and artistic activities in the troops.\n\nAround the time of the Qingfengdian Campaign last year, individual companies spontaneously adapted and performed the model deeds of their company. These performances were realistic, concise, and lively, and were very popular among the soldiers. However, they were limited to praising models. During the troop training at the end of the year, a unit began to perform \"Soldier Acting as Soldier\" in close coordination with the central work, which had a significant effect on troop education and the completion of the central work at that time.\n\nIn February, the unit's leadership summarized this situation and clearly pointed out that it is a very good form of mass political work, as well as mass self-education, political and cultural education, and literary and artistic activities. Over the past four months, through the attention and advocacy of leaders at all levels, summarizing experiences, publicizing commendations, conducting grand competitions, and organizing visits, most companies have now launched \"Soldier Acting as Soldier,\" and are continuously improving it in terms of content and form. It has progressed from simply praising models and transforming the backward to promoting work and enlivening the troops, and now to completing policy and tactical education and completing the central work through \"Soldier Acting as Soldier.\" When a unit studied policies in May, some companies performed \"Fair Trade\" and \"Mutual Aid Teams\" (policy study mutual aid), which greatly helped policy education. When a unit conducted training on Chairman Mao's Ten Military Principles, they turned the situation of various battles over the past year into a large sand table. Everyone participated and performed in the form of \"Soldier Acting as Soldier\" for everyone to learn, which was very easy for everyone to understand. Because the soldiers themselves adapted and performed their own real events in their own words and in the form they liked best, it was particularly realistic, skillful, easy to perform, and enjoyable to perform. Everyone also found it particularly easy to understand and enjoy watching.\n\nAt one evening event, soldiers performed sixteen programs. In May, a unit performed fifty-four programs, with more than two hundred soldiers serving as actors. When a unit conducted grievance education last winter, a company adapted and performed the history and model deeds of Luo Kunhua, a great meritorious person in their company, who suffered from childhood in the landlord's family, was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek army to serve as a soldier, and bravely killed enemies and made great contributions after being liberated into our army. Many people cried after watching it. Many people said, \"This is better than class. I understand the two classes of the poor and the rich!\" The liberated soldiers Guo Yongde and others cried the most. They said, \"The deep hatred of blood can only be avenged in the People's Liberation Army. We swear not to go home until we capture Chiang Kai-shek!\" This sparked a wave of \"learning from Luo Kunhua.\" Luo Kunhua was commended and worked even harder himself. During troop training last winter, after the soldiers of the seventh squad of a unit watched the performance of \"Tian Jiachen's meritorious service in throwing grenades,\" Shi Zhuzi went to throw grenades outside the village whenever he had time. He said, \"I must surpass Tian Jiachen and have myself adapted into a play!\" In a certain operation, a unit had once developed a mood of complaining about hardships and fearing fatigue, and discipline was lax in individual units. Of the twenty-five programs performed by the unit at that time, ten were aimed at promoting a hard-working style. This played a great role in overcoming the then-existing bad tendencies. After a company performed \"Hardship Model Zhang Dexiang,\" many soldiers challenged Zhang Dexiang to compete in hardship. Companies learned from Zhang Dexiang one after another. Now, such public opinion is popular among the soldiers: \"Whoever has made a contribution, we will put on a play for him and learn from him; whoever has made a mistake and refuses to correct it, we will put on a play for him and let him correct it!\" It is felt to be very convenient to mobilize the masses through \"Soldier Acting as Soldier\" after the leadership has deployed a task and issued a call.\n\nAs a result of \"Soldier Acting as Soldier,\" the soldiers play games and rehearse programs with gongs and drums during their spare time. The obscene and vulgar tunes that individual soldiers brought into the army from the old society have been replaced by this new form of recreational activities. It has also promoted cultural learning in the troops. Many soldiers have learned culture during rehearsals. The actors in the fifth company of a unit who rehearsed \"Zhang Lengxiao Believes in the Party Newspaper\" took the initiative to study culture because they were interested in the clapper talk.\n\n(Zhang Ping, Ma Ying, Wang Deguang, Ma Xiukun, Wang Daping, Gu Ping, Rong Lu)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 提倡群众性的政治文化自我教育　解放军某部开展兵演兵\n\n1948-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　提倡群众性的政治文化自我教育\n  　解放军某部开展兵演兵\n    【华北前线十七日电】华北解放军某部，现正普遍开展一种兵演兵运动，由领导上有计划的组织战士自己编排，自己演出，达到自己教育自己、提高自己，并已成为军政工作走群众路线的工作方法之一，创造了部队群众性文艺活动的新方向。\n    去年清风店战役前后，该部个别连队自发的把本连的模范事迹自编自演，真实、简短、活泼，很受战士欢迎。但还只限于表扬模范。年底练兵时，某部开始以兵演兵密切配合中心工作演出，对部队教育和完成当时中心工作，收到很大效果。\n    二月，该部领导上总结了这种情况，明确指出：它是群众性政治工作，也是群众性自我教育、政治文化教育、文艺活动很好的一种形式。四个月来，经各级领导的重视提倡，总结经验，通报表扬，大竞赛，参观，现在大部分连队都已开展了兵演兵，并在内容与形式上使它日益提高。开始只是从表扬模范，转变落后，以推动工作，活跃部队，现已进到以兵演兵完成政策、战术教育，完成中心工作。某部五月间学习政策时，有的连队演出“买卖公平”、“互助组”（政策学习互助），对政策教育帮助很大；某部进行毛主席十大军事原则训练时，又把我军一年来各战役情况成大砂盘，大家都参加，以兵演兵形式表演出来让大家学习，大家很易明白。由于战士自己把自己的实事，以自己的话，自己最喜爱的形式编演成剧，所以特别逼真、熟练，特别易演、爱演，大家也特别易懂爱看。\n    某部在一次晚会上，战士一下演出十六个节目。某部五月份演出五十四个节目，有二百多战士担任演员。某部去冬进行诉苦教育时，某连把他连里的大功臣罗坤华自小在财主家受苦，被蒋军抓去当兵，解放到我军后，英勇杀敌立大功的历史及模范事迹编剧演出，许多人都看哭了，不少人说：“这比上课还强，我闹清穷富两阶级了！”解放战士郭永德等哭得最厉害，他们说：“血海深仇，只有在解放军里才能报，捉不住蒋介石誓不回家！”因此掀起“学习罗坤华”的热潮。罗坤华受到表扬，自己更努力了。去冬练兵时，某部二连演出“田介臣投弹立功”，七班战士石柱子看后，每天有空都到村外投弹，他说：“我一定要超过田介臣，把我也编成剧！”某部在××作战，一度滋长了叫苦怕累情绪，个别单位纪律松懈，该部当时演出的二十五个节目中，就有十个是发扬艰苦作风的。对克服当时不良倾向，起了很大的作用。某连演出“艰苦模范张德祥”后，许多战士就和张德祥挑战比艰苦。各连纷纷向张德祥学习。现在战士中流行着这样的舆论：“谁立了功就给人家上上戏，学习人家；谁犯了错误老不改，就给谁演一演，让他改正！”领导上布置一个工作，发出一个号召，经过兵演兵去发动群众，感到很大的方便。\n    由于兵演兵的结果，该部平时课余游戏时，就锣鼓喧天，排演节目。个别战士从旧社会里带来部队的淫词滥调，已为这种新的文娱活动所代替了。并且推动了部队的文化学习，许多战士都在排演中学习了文化。某部五连排演“张楞小相信了党报”的演员们，因对快板感到兴趣，而主动的学习文化。\n    　　　　　　（张平、马英、王德光、马秀昆、王达萍、谷平、熔炉）"

    "date": "1948-07-21",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The branch party members led the masses in production and self-salvation.\nWanping Fourth District Overcomes Disaster\n[Chahar News] Wanping Fourth District consists of twenty-four villages, all of which are very poor. The amount of land is small, and the quality is also poor. The average per capita landholding in the entire district is less than two mu. The relatively wealthy Qiulinzhen Village has an average of only 2.5 mu per person. Zhongshan Village has only about 0.7 mu per person. In normal years, the grain harvested in the district, plus mountain products such as walnuts, peppercorns, and almonds, is not enough to sustain a year's life. The shortfall is mainly made up by income from cutting firewood and burning charcoal in winter, and working in kilns in Mentougou. The lives of the masses are very difficult. The harvest was bad last year. In Qingtujian Village, with 124 households, more than 20 households had nothing to eat after the autumn harvest, and this year's spring famine was very serious.\n\nThe masses in the district adopted the following methods to finally overcome the spring famine, plant all the spring seedlings, and complete the first hoeing. (1) Actively develop production such as transporting and selling medicinal materials and digging them. After the autumn harvest last year, the masses in the district foresaw that this spring's disaster would be serious, so they actively carried out winter production, transporting and selling persimmons in large quantities. In Qingtujian Village, even the old men in their sixties, children of fifteen or sixteen, and women participated in transportation and sales, carrying persimmons back from Liangxiang Hetaogou, sixty or seventy li away, and then going to Zhuolu to exchange them for grain. Until the beginning of this year, in addition to eating, the village earned a total of 300 shi of corn from selling persimmons, which could solve the village's grain problem for at least two months. In order to solve the difficulties of the masses in the district, the store used grain to collect medicinal materials in large quantities this spring. The masses all lived on Baihua Mountain digging medicinal materials. Jinjitai Village earned 3,000 jin of millet from digging medicinal materials. Yu Laobai alone dug more than 100 jin in seven or eight days, earning more than 80 jin of millet. Other villages also earned a lot from digging medicinal materials, selling peppercorns, and selling toon. (2) The government focuses on issuing agricultural loans to support production. Two loans of 84,000 jin of grain, one loan of 62 million yuan (border currency, same below), and 11,000 jin of militia battle grain originally in the district, were also selectively loaned out, appropriately solving the difficulties of disaster-stricken villages and households in spring plowing, sowing, and the first hoeing. Now the sowing and first hoeing in the entire district have been completed ahead of schedule, and the second hoeing is being organized. (3) Organize military dependents, workers, and families of martyrs for production, reducing the labor burden on the masses, so that the masses have time to engage in more production and increase income. From spring plowing to the first hoeing, Jinjitai Village used 1,000 fewer preferential workdays than in the same period last year, allowing the masses to free up more time to dig medicinal materials and engage in transportation and sales. (4) A mountain vegetable campaign was launched, saving a lot of grain. Taian Mountain Village has already collected 20,000 jin of dried elm leaves, which can save more than 10,000 jin of grain.\n\nThe district's organization and leadership of the masses to overcome the famine grasped several key points: (1) Strengthen publicity and education to the masses and cadres, so that everyone recognizes the severity of the disaster and the need for production and self-salvation. And pay attention to overcoming the idea of ​​some people simply relying on agricultural loans for \"relief.\" Liu Juchen, a poor peasant in Xiyuan Village, had an attitude of not engaging in production, thinking that he would be given more food when he ran out, so he ate and drank extravagantly the four shi of corn and one shi of grain he had been allocated during the land reform. Later, after the cadres explained and educated him, he realized his mistake of waste, and from then on he actively engaged in transportation and sales, and ate vegetables to overcome the famine. (2) Branch party members played a leading role in production and overcoming the famine. In response to the district party committee's call for \"party members to lead the masses to overcome the famine,\" the Jinjitai Village branch immediately convened a branch mobilization meeting to discuss methods and decided that party members should participate in various production organizations. Zhang Guangyi led the entire village in picking mountain vegetables, and also led Yu Congqi and Tan Wentian to Baihua Mountain to dig medicinal materials. The most recent time they went for three days, each person brought back more than 50 jin, which could be exchanged for 40 jin of millet.\n\nThe following shortcomings still exist in the district's production and famine relief work, some of which have been corrected and some of which are being resolved: (1) Not all grain and loans were used for production, and some villages still have the phenomenon of average use. For example, the first grain loan in Jinlintai was available to every poor peasant household, and it was not rationally distributed based on needs. Zhang Chengxian used the loan to pay off his smoking debt, but some middle peasants who had nothing to eat did not receive a loan. (2) Cadre transfers are frequent, and some individuals do not work with peace of mind, and do not pay enough attention to leading production and overcoming the famine. They think that once the spring seedlings are planted, the production work is almost done, and there is no need to lead it anymore. Later, this idea was reversed. (3) The work has not been thoroughly checked among the masses. Many villages have experienced diseases and disasters, and the leaders have not quickly organized doctors to treat them, and many witches have taken the opportunity to become active, affecting production and overcoming the famine.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 支部党员领导群众生产自救　宛平四区渡过灾荒\n\n1948-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　支部党员领导群众生产自救\n  　宛平四区渡过灾荒\n    【察哈尔讯】宛平四区共有二十四个村庄，全很穷。土地数量少，质量也坏。全区每人平均不到二亩。较富的秋林镇村，每人平均才二亩五分。中山村每人平均才有七分左右。该区平常年景，打的粮食加上核桃、花椒、杏仁等山货，也不足维持一年的生活。缺额主要依靠冬季砍柴烧炭，和到门头沟走窑等收入弥补，群众生活非常苦寒。去年收成不好，一百二十四户的青土涧村，收秋后就有二十多户没有吃的，今年春荒非常严重。\n    该区群众采用以下办法，终于胜利的渡过春荒，种上全部春苗，并已锄完头遍。（一）积极开展运销刨药材等生产。去年秋收以后，该区群众预见到今春灾荒一定严重，因而积极的进行了冬季生产，大量的贩柿子，搞运销。青土涧村连六十多岁的老头，十五六的儿童及妇女都参加运销，到六、七十里地远的良乡河套沟去背回柿子，再到涿鹿去换粮食，直至今年开春，除去吃用外，全村贩柿子总共挣了棒子三百石，最少能解决全村两个月的吃粮。商店为了解救该区群众的困难，今春用粮食大量收药材。群众全到百花山上住着刨掘，金鸡台一村，刨药材收入达小米三千斤。该村于老百一个人七八天刨了一百来斤，得小米八十多斤。其他村庄刨药材、卖花椒、卖香椿的收入也都不少。（二）政府有重点的发放农贷扶助生产。两次贷粮八万四千斤，一次贷款六千二百万元（边币，下同），区里原有的民兵战粮等一万一千斤，也有重点的贷出，适当的解决了灾村灾户春耕播种和锄头遍当中的困难，现全区播种和锄头遍已提前完成，正组织锄二遍中。（三）组织军、工、烈属生产，减轻群众劳力负担，使群众有时间从事更多的生产，增加收入。金鸡台村从春耕到锄头遍，比去年同时期少用了一千个优待工，使群众能誊出更多的时间去刨药材、作运销。（四）开展了打山菜运动，节省下不少粮食。太安山村已打下干榆叶两万斤，能节省粮食一万来斤。\n    该区组织领导群众渡荒，掌握了几个关键：（一）加强对群众、干部的宣传教育，使大家认识到灾荒严重，必须生产自救。并注意了克服某些人单纯依靠农贷“救济”的思想。西苑村贫农刘巨臣，有一种不事生产的思想，认为没吃的还会再分给他，就把土改中分得的四石玉米一石谷，大吃二喝起来。后来干部对他解释教育，他认识到自己浪费的错误，从此就积极的搞运销，吃菜渡荒。（二）支部党员在生产渡荒中起了带头作用。金鸡台村支部响应区委“党员领导群众渡荒”的号召，立即召开支部动员大会，商讨办法，决定党员都参加到各种生产组织中去。张广义领导全村打山菜，还领着于从起、谭文田到百花山刨药材，最近一次去了三天，每人刨回来五十多斤，能换小米四十斤。\n    该区生产渡荒工作中，还存有以下缺点，有的已经纠正，有的正在解决：（一）贷粮贷款未全部用到生产中去，某些村还有平均使用的现象。如金林台的第一次贷粮是每户贫农都有，并未从需要出发合理分配。张成贤把贷款还了抽烟帐，但某些中农没有吃的，却未贷到粮食。（二）干部调动频繁，个别人工作不安心，对生产渡荒的领导不够重视。认为种出春苗来，生产工作就差不多了，用不着再领导了，后来才把这种思想扭转过来。（三）没有很好的深入群众中检查工作。不少村庄发生病灾，领导上没有很快组织医生救治，许多巫婆趁机活动起来，影响了生产渡荒。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, July 17th: The People's Liberation Army, with unparalleled heroism, tenacity, and proactive attacks, fiercely struck at the Chiang bandit Fifth Army and the 83rd Division, which attempted to reinforce the besieged Qu Shounian army group between ＠ (county) and Sui (county). They killed, wounded, and captured over 5,000 men from the Fifth Army and 3,000 men from the 83rd Division, totaling over 8,000 men, ensuring the glorious victory of annihilating the entire enemy Qu Shounian army group headquarters, the 75th Division, the entire New 21st Brigade, and part of the 25th Division. The course of the interception battle is as follows: When the enemy Qu Shounian army group was divided and surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, the enemy Fifth Army and 83rd Division hastily moved east from ＠ county to reinforce. From June 27th to July 6th, the enemy used aircraft, heavy artillery, and tanks to cover their eastward advance, but they were consistently blocked by the iron walls of the People's Liberation Army at predetermined positions such as Banzhuang, Xugang, Taolinggang, and Gaoyangji between ＠ county and Sui county. In those ten days, the enemy's furthest advance did not exceed ten *li*. On June 29th, the enemy Fifth Army's 96th Brigade and 139th Brigade launched a fierce attack on the positions around Gaoyangji and Sunzhai. The 415th Regiment of their 139th Brigade attempted to seize Chenzhuang, east of Gaoyangji, with superior forces. The 2nd Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, which was defending Chenzhuang, repelled six enemy attacks in eight hours, killing and wounding two companies of enemy troops. They held their position firmly and remained immovable, preventing the enemy from seizing a springboard for attacking Gaoyangji. From June 30th, the enemy Fifth Army again attempted to break through eastward in the Taolinggang area. Our army first killed and wounded over 200 enemies at Chengzhai, west of Taolinggang, and then launched counterattacks in villages such as Tu (west of Taolinggang). When the enemy approached our army's position with a battalion-sized force, combat hero Dai Xianyun led a platoon to leap out of the fortifications and attack the enemy fiercely. At the same time, the 5th Company inserted itself into the enemy's left rear flank in several directions, causing the enemy to fall like paper horses in the wind. The next day, the enemy used its elite 600th Regiment of the 200th Brigade, under the cover of aircraft, heavy artillery, and tanks, to attack our Taolinggang position. When the attacking enemy was still 300 meters away from our position, artilleryman A Sheng had already destroyed two enemy tanks in succession, and groups of enemies were killed. Then, they repelled the enemy's second attack and damaged two more of their tanks. At this point, our army took advantage of the victory to launch counterattacks on Zhangge, Quzhai, and other places near Taolinggang, capturing Quzhai and routing an enemy battalion headquarters and a company of the 599th Regiment, killing the enemy battalion commander Wu Fuen. On the third day, they tried their best to attack Taolinggang, using aircraft and heavy artillery for destructive bombardment. A battalion of the enemy's 600th Regiment was forced to launch a human-wave assault under the muzzles of supervising officers. We then launched a flanking counterattack, annihilating all of their second company. The enemy collapsed in disarray. In these three days alone, we killed and wounded over 2,000 enemy troops.\n\n　　The enemy's 83rd Division, on the north bank of the Huiji River, attempted to seize our Xugang position, suffered heavy casualties, and was surrounded by us in Banzhuang and other places. Finally, they abandoned over 200 bodies and fled. Our army then pursued them, capturing over 20 alive. On the morning of July 3rd, the enemy Fifth Army replaced the enemy 83rd Division, throwing in all of its 45th Brigade and some attached tanks, and launched another fierce attack on Xugang, using twelve howitzers and more than ten aircraft to frantically bombard and strafe our positions. The commanders and fighters of a certain battalion of our army leaped out of the smoke-filled fortifications and engaged the enemy in fierce hand-to-hand combat, refusing to yield an inch of ground and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the same day, the enemy Qu Shounian army group headquarters and the 75th Division were completely annihilated at Yuxiangpu, more than ten *li* east of Xugang. The enemy Fifth Army and 83rd Division, in addition to losing 8,000 men, gained nothing. A certain unit of our army successfully completed the interception mission.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 无比英勇主动出击胜利完成阻击任务　豫东阻击战经过\n\n1948-07-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　无比英勇主动出击胜利完成阻击任务\n  　豫东阻击战经过\n    【新华社豫东前线十七日电】解放军在＠（县）睢（县）之间，以无比的英勇顽强与主动出击，痛击企图东援区寿年兵团的蒋匪第五军及八十三师，毙伤俘第五军五千余人，八十三师三千人共八千余人，保证了歼灭敌区寿年兵团部、七十五师及新二十一旅全部与二十五师一部的光辉胜利。阻击战经过如下：当敌区寿年兵团被解放军分割包围时，敌第五军及八十三师即仓惶自＠县东援。六月二十七日至七月六日，敌以飞机、重炮、战车掩护东犯，但始终被解放军的铜墙铁壁阻截于＠县、睢县间的班庄、许岗、桃林岗、高阳集等预定阵地之前，十天中敌人前进最远的不超过十里左右。六月二十九日，敌第五军九十六旅及一三九旅向高阳集、孙砦一带阵地猛扑，其一三九旅之四一五团妄图以优势兵力夺取高阳集以东之陈庄。坚守陈庄的解放军某部二连，在八小时内击退敌六次进攻，毙伤敌两个连的兵力。坚持阵地，屹然不动，使敌无法夺取进犯高阳集的跳板。六月三十日起，敌第五军又企图在桃林岗一带夺路东窜，我军首先在桃林岗以西之程砦杀伤敌二百余名，复于土（桃林岗西）等村展开反击。当敌人以一个营的兵力逼近我军阵地时，战斗英雄戴先运率一排跃出工事向敌人猛击，同时五连又突分数路插入敌左后侧，敌当如风吹纸马，纷纷倒地。次日，敌以其精锐的二百旅第六百团，在飞机、重炮与坦克掩护下，向我桃林岗阵地进犯。当进攻的敌人距我阵地尚有三百米时，炮手阿声已连续击毁敌两辆坦克，成群的敌人被击毙。接着又击溃敌第二次的进攻，并击伤其坦克两辆。至此我军乃乘胜对桃林岗附近之张阁、屈砦等地展开反击，并夺下屈砦，击溃敌五九九团一个营部及一个连，毙敌营长吴福恩。第三天又拼全力进犯桃林岗，并以飞机重炮作毁灭性轰击，敌六百团一营在督战枪口下，被迫作肉弹冲锋。我乃迂回反击，歼其二连全部，敌狼狈溃退，仅这三日之中我即毙伤敌二千余名。\n    在惠济河北岸之敌八十三师企图夺我许岗阵地，遭受了重大杀伤后，被我包围于班庄等地，最后遗尸二百余具夺路逃窜。我军乃跟踪追击，生俘二十余名。七月三日上午，敌第五军接替敌八十三师，倾其四十五旅全部及配属战车一部，又向许岗猛犯，以十二门榴弹炮及十余架飞机向我疯狂轰击扫射。我军某营指战员自烟硝弥漫的工事里跃出与敌撕杀，寸土不让，予敌以重大杀伤。当日，敌区寿年兵团部及七十五师，即在许岗以东十余里的榆厢铺被全部歼灭。敌第五军及八十三师除损失八千人外，毫无所获。我某部胜利完成阻击任务。"

The \"National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions\" has decided to lead a joint struggle with the civil servant unions and municipal worker unions, proving that there is a tendency in Japan to establish a united front of working people. The coal miners' union, which recently protested the coal mine accident, has warned that unless labor safety facilities are improved, countermeasures will be taken. The Federation of Silk Workers' Unions, with 80,000 members, has requested the \"Central Labor Problem Committee\" to mediate on the issue of wage increase demands. Railway workers in Aomori Prefecture are now preparing for a strike. The \"Tokyo Minpo\" predicts that the upcoming \"workers' offensive will be a broad, powerful, and lasting one.\" The Jiji Shinpo was also forced to admit that trade unions are now much stronger than they were in March. According to Kyodo News: Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida recently threatened that the government will take \"forceful measures\" to deal with the trade union offensive. Note: At the time of Japan's surrender, there were only 450,000 trade union members in Japan, which increased to more than 2 million at the beginning of 1946, and suddenly increased to 4.45 million at the end of the same year. In May 1947, there were 19,000 trade unions in Japan, uniting 5.5 million workers, half of whom were members of the left-wing trade union organization - the National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions. According to a survey by MacArthur Headquarters on June 28: At present, the number of Japanese labor groups, including local unions, has reached 30,000, with a total of 6.5 million members.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. Tokyo News: Two thousand members of the \"National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions\" and Korean youths marched and demonstrated in Osaka on the 13th, protesting against the police's oppression of the people, and held a mass rally, demanding the immediate dissolution of the parliament. Teachers and staff in various schools in Hokkaido went on a 24-hour strike on the 13th, demanding a salary increase. Japanese newspaper reports pointed out that this was the prelude to the \"All-Japan Teachers' Union's\" nationwide 24-hour strike on July 15th.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. TASS Tokyo News: Since the 11th, the Ashida government has increased the prices of the people's main foods, such as rice, wheat, barley, potatoes, and soybeans, by an average of 50% to 100%. According to the \"Japan Economy\": The Japanese working class is deeply angered by the rise in the prices of necessities. Kokumi Kikitani, chairman of the \"National Federation of Industrial Labor Unions\" of Japan, criticized the government for formulating a plan to revise prices with some businessmen before an agreement was reached on the budget issue, and for raising prices without submitting the issue to the parliament.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日本工运进展迅速　三万劳工团体拥有六百余万会员大坂工人示威北海道教师罢教\n\n1948-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日本工运进展迅速\n  　三万劳工团体拥有六百余万会员大坂工人示威北海道教师罢教\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】据塔斯社十二日电引东京报纸消息称：日本的劳工运动正急速前进中。“全国产业劳动组合联合会”决定领导与公务员工会及市政人员工会共同进行的联合斗争，证明在日本已存在建立劳动人民统一战线的趋势。最近曾抗议煤矿出事的矿工工会已发出警告称：除非劳工安全设施得到改善，否则即将采取对策。拥有会员八万的丝业工人工会联合会，要求“中央劳工问题委员会”进行调解关于增资要求的问题。青森县的铁道工人，现正准备罢工。“东京民报”预言：即将到来的“工人攻势，将是一个广泛的、有力的及持久的攻势。”时事新报也被迫承认，职工会现均较三月份时强大得多。据协同社讯：日首相芦田均最近扬言，政府将采取“有力措施”以对付职工会的攻势。按：在日本投降时，全日职工会会员只有四十五万人，至一九四六年初增至二百余万人，同年年底突增至四百四十五万人。一九四七年五月，日本已有一万九千个职工会，团结了五百五十万工人，其中半数是左翼职工组织——全国产业劳动组合联合会的会员。又据麦克阿瑟总部于六月二十八日统计：在目前包括地方工会在内之日本劳工团体数达三万，共拥有六百五十万名会员。\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京消息：“全国产业劳动组合联合会”属下之两千会员及朝鲜青年，于十三日在大坂游行示威，抗议警察对人民之压迫，并举行群众大会，提出立即解散议会的要求。北海道各校的教职员，曾于十三日进行二十四小时罢教，要求增薪。日本报纸消息指出：这是“全日教师联盟”七月十五日举行全国性二十四小时罢教之序幕。\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社东京讯：自十一日起，芦田政府已将人民主要食物如大米、小麦、大麦、洋芋及大豆等之价格，平均提高百分之五十至一百。据“日本经济”称：日本工人阶级对必需品价格之上涨深表愤怒。日本“全国产业劳动组合联合会”主席听涛克已抨击政府在预算问题达成协议以前，即与若干商人制定改订物价的计划，并且未将此问题提交议会即行提高物价。"

Comrade Zhang Guixing, a cook in our school, is from Nanxiaohe Village, Second District, Changzi County, Taiyue. The village asked him to contribute corvée labor grain. Our school has issued a certificate for him, but it was ineffective. This March, the Third Special District Office sent an official letter, but the Changzi County government still has not corrected this, resulting in him having to pay 120 jin of millet. On May 10th, this comrade took leave to go home.

    "content": "[Frontline News] A certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army recently conducted a comprehensive inspection of the comparison and appraisal movement over twenty days, and summarized four basic experiences:\n\n    First, the comparison and appraisal movement took the new-style military consolidation movement of \"Three Check-ups,\" \"Three Rectifications,\" and \"Speaking Bitterness\" a step further, making it a collective progress movement on the basis of increased class consciousness. Since the comparison and appraisal movement, the unit's ideological leadership and work style have made considerable progress. The vast majority of cadres have enhanced their political responsibility, can promptly discover and solve problems in their work, focus on their work, and strengthen their concept of cherishing soldiers. A generally widespread hard-working style has been established in the troops, with cadres setting an example, working together with soldiers to overcome difficulties. Policy thinking and discipline have also been greatly strengthened, and violations of policies and discipline have been greatly reduced. The concentrated manifestation of achievements is that righteousness is high in the troops, the atmosphere of learning and the enterprising spirit of revolutionary heroism are gradually rising in the troops, solving some problems that were not solved during the \"Three Check-ups\" and \"Speaking Bitterness,\" and ensuring and accelerating the smooth completion of various tasks. A large number of comrades were commended for meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal. In a certain unit, more than 400 people were awarded meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal, accounting for 18% of the unit's total number. In a certain combat company, as many as 50% of the people were awarded meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal. Relatively backward comrades have also undergone changes in the collective progress.\n\n    Second, in the revolutionary competition of three comparisons and four comparisons, it is necessary to grasp the three basic principles of seeking truth from facts, being conscious and voluntary, and uniting and helping each other to achieve the goal of common progress, and to oppose forced comparisons and hard comparisons, otherwise, tendencies such as formalism, coercion, individual heroism, and trophy-ism will arise. In the process, emphasize self-comparison (better than the present in the future, better than the past in the present) to realize individual progress plans. And advocate comparisons between units with the same establishment to stimulate the collective progress thinking of each mutually comparing unit and each comrade.\n\n    Third, combine the evaluation of merits and demerits, timely comparison and appraisal, and summarize segment by segment. However, it is necessary to grasp the two principles of democracy and merit-reward education as the main focus to achieve fairness and reasonableness, and clear rewards and punishments. In summarizing the mountain march, a certain company focused on merit-reward education, and after democratic evaluation, summarized the results of comparing two soldiers, and the two soldiers were very satisfied. This also had a good impact on other soldiers. After this summary, the number of people comparing increased from 15 pairs of 30 people to 30 pairs of 60 people, ensuring and accelerating the smooth completion of the company's mountain march task.\n\n    Fourth, in the comparison and appraisal movement, the promotion of new heroism must be combined with serious self-criticism, and encouragement and commendation must be more than criticism, and meritorious service must be more than punishment. Criticism and punishment are aimed at educating and transforming them to consciously participate in the competition for meritorious service. Some units mistakenly regarded self-criticism as a negative thing, and regarded strict discipline as pure punishment, comparing too much about shortcomings and faults, recording too many demerits and punishments, which made everyone feel low and unwilling to compare again. Some units also erroneously opposed multiple commendations and multiple meritorious records to strict self-criticism in promoting revolutionary heroism, making the comrades and units who won meritorious service in the comparison and appraisal proud, complacent, and divorced from the masses. The reason why the heroes, models, and typicals in these units often fail to persevere is this reason.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Dù Dǎozhèng)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 某部比评运动经验\n杜导正\n1948-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　某部比评运动经验\n    【前线讯】华北解放军某部近对比评运动作了二十天的普遍检查，研究总结出四项基本经验：\n    第一、比评运动把“三查”、“三整”、“诉苦”的新式整军运动向前更进了一步，使之成为阶级觉悟提高基础上的集体进步运动。自比评运动以来，该部思想领导与工作作风均有较大进步。极多数干部提高了政治责任心，在工作中能及时发现与解决问题，安心工作，并加强了爱兵观念。部队中相当普遍的树立了艰苦作风，干部以身作则，与战士同策同力，克服困难。政策思想、纪律观念也大大加强，违犯政策、纪律的现象大为减少。成绩的集中表现，是部队中正气昂扬，学习空气与革命英雄主义的进取心在部队中逐步上升，解决了一些“三查”及“诉苦”时都没有解决的问题，保证和加速了各项任务的顺利完成。比评中大批同志立功受奖。某单位在比评中立功者四百余人，占该单位总人数百分之十八。某战斗连比评中立功者竟达百分之五十。较落后的同志在集体进步中也都有了转变。\n    第二、在三比、四比的革命竞赛中，必须掌握实事求是、自觉自愿、团结互助三个基本原则，以达到共同进步的目的，反对强比硬比，否则便会产生形式、强迫、个人英雄主义、锦标主义等偏向。在进行中强调自比（今后要比现在好，现在要比过去好），实现个人进步计划。并提倡同一建制的单位比，激发各互比单位及各个同志的集体进步思想。\n    第三、结合评功论过，及时比评，逐段总结。但必须掌握民主及功赏教育为主的两个原则，达到公平合理，赏罚严明。某连在总结山地行军中，以功赏教育为主，经过民主评判，总结两个战士相比的结果，这两个战士非常满意，在其它战士中也发生了很好的影响，这次总结后，比的人数由十五对三十人增到三十对六十人，保证和加速了这个连队山地行军任务的顺利完成。\n    第四、在比评运动中发扬新英雄主义，必须与严肃的自我批评相结合，鼓励表扬必须多于批评，立功必须多于惩罚，批评与惩罚又是以教育改造使其自觉参加竞赛立功为目的。某些单位错误的把自我批评当做消极的东西，把严格纪律当成单纯的惩罚，过多的比缺点、比过失，多记过、多惩罚，弄得大家情绪不高，不愿再比。也有某些单位在发扬革命英雄主义中，把多表扬、多记功，错误的与严格自我批评对立起来，使得比评中立功获胜的同志与单位骄傲自满，脱离群众。这些单位中的功臣、模范、典型常常坚持不下来，就是这个原因。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（杜导正）"

Therefore, the proclamation stated \"whoever sows, reaps,\" and all localities must resolutely implement it.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th:\n\n    The French imperialists are attempting to restore colonial rule in Vietnam. Not only French troops but also Nazi bandits are fighting in the colonial war against the Vietnamese people. The recruitment of German officers and soldiers to form foreign legions was carried out in prisoner-of-war camps in the French-occupied zone of Germany. This legion was later transferred to Vietnam, and it contained 15,000 German soldiers, almost all of whom were young Nazis fostered by Hitler. Most of the French colonial administrative officials in Vietnam are former traitorous Vichy elements. Many Vichy elements have found refuge in Saigon and other cities in Vietnam.\n\n    Military force is not enough to crush a nation fighting for its independence, so the imperialists are plotting to divide its ranks. They are doing this with the help of local feudal aristocrats and reactionary religious leaders who collaborated with the Japanese during the war. They have established puppet governments in Cambodia and Laos. The main political tool used by the French imperialists against Vietnam and its democratic government headed by Ho Chi Minh is the so-called \"Vietnam National United Front\" (established in Nanjing in 1947, its leader being Lê Văn Hoạch, now a minister without portfolio in Nguyễn Văn Xuân's puppet \"Provisional Central Government of Vietnam\"). This group claims to oppose the \"danger of communism\" and is agitating for the return of former Annam King Bảo Đại to Vietnam.\n\n    The colonial war launched by the French ruling clique in Vietnam is not supported by the French people. Even among the French officers and soldiers in Vietnam, many oppose this war fought for the interests of the French two hundred families. Thirty Frenchmen (some of whom were French colonial military officers) wrote a letter to the former French High Commissioner to Vietnam, D'Argenlieu, appealing for peace and freedom for the Vietnamese, and stating that the only way to solve the Vietnam problem is to recognize its independence within the French Union and to stop the war.\n\n    The French colonists in Vietnam, like the Dutch in Indonesia, cannot carry out aggression without the political, military, and financial support of the United States. The aid is not limited to supplying the French colonial army with American weapons. Some time ago, U.S. expansionist envoy Bullitt held talks with Bảo Đại and the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Pignon. Bullitt advocated a more vigorous war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and accelerated negotiations between the French government and Bảo Đại for the restoration of the Annam puppet empire. Military operations have been strengthened. In February and March, the French army launched new large-scale offensives on all fronts in Vietnam, but still made no progress.\n\n    Guerrilla warfare is unfolding throughout Vietnam. Not only in Annam and Tonkin, but even in the Saigon area in the pseudo-Cochinchina Republic (the heartland of French rule), the people's forces are participating in the fight against the aggressors. On March 11, the National Liberation Committee was established in Laos to direct actions against the French army. In a telegram to the Ho Chi Minh government, the committee declared its solidarity with the people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On April 16, the Vietnam News Agency reported President Ho Chi Minh's interview with foreign journalists on the war issue. Ho Chi Minh said: \"The French army has suffered 60,000 casualties, while thanks to the success of guerrilla tactics, the Viet Minh army has suffered only minor casualties. The French army can only occupy and control some large cities, while all the rest of the territory is mostly occupied by the Viet Minh army and controlled by the democratic government... The Vietnamese people believe in their victory and are prepared to make any sacrifices, and are determined to achieve the complete independence and unity of Vietnam.\"\n\n(Excerpt from the Soviet magazine New Times, April 21 of this year)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 越南近况\n\n1948-07-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　越南近况\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】\n    法帝国主义者企图在越南恢复殖民地统治。不仅法国军队而且纳粹匪徒也在反对越南人民的殖民战争中作战。征募德军官兵成立外国军团是在德境法占区战俘营中实行的，该军团后来被调到越南，在该团中有一万五千名德兵，他们几乎都是希特勒豢养的青年纳粹分子。在越南的法国殖民地行政官员，大部分是从前的卖国贼维希分子，许多维希分子在西贡和越南其他城市中找到了避难所。\n    武力不足以粉碎一个为其独立而战的民族，帝国主义者遂立图分裂其队伍。他们借助于当地封建贵族及战时与日寇合作的反动宗教领袖们的帮助。他们在柬埔寨与老挝建立了傀儡政府。法帝国主义用以反对越南及其以胡志明为首的民主政府的主要政治工具，便是所谓“越南民族联盟阵线”（按于一九四七年成立于南京，其首魁黎文划，现任阮文春伪“越南临时中央政府”之不管部阁员）。这一集团声言反对“共产主义危险”，并为前安南王保大重返越南而进行煽动。\n    法国统治集团在越南发动的殖民地战争，法国人民并不赞成。甚至在越南的法国官兵中，也有许多人反对这一为法国二百家的利益而进行的战争。三十名法国人（其中有一些法国殖民地军官）曾为给越南前高级专员达根留一封信，替越南人呼吁和平和自由，并谓解决越南问题的唯一办法，便是承认它在法国联盟内的独立及停止战争。\n    在越南的法国殖民者们，如在印尼的荷兰人一样，没有美国的政治、军事与财政上的支援是不能够进行侵略的。援助并不限于供给法国殖民军以美国武器。若干时以前，美国扩张主义者的特使布立特，与保大及法驻越高级专员波拉埃进行商谈。布立特主张更猛烈地对越南民主共和国作战，并加速法政府与保大间恢复安南傀儡帝国的谈判。军事行动加强了。二三月间，在所有越南各前线上，法军发动了新的大规模攻势，但仍然无任何进展。\n    游击战争在全越展开。不仅在安南与东京，甚至在伪交趾支那共和国领土上的西贡地区（按系法国统治的心脏地区），人民的力量都参加了反对侵略者的战斗。三月十一日，在老挝成立了民族解放委员会，以指挥反对法军的行动。在致胡志明政府的电文中，该委员会宣称它与越南民主共和国的人民团结一致。四月十六日，越南民主共和国通讯社报导胡志明总统对外国记者关于战争问题的谈话。胡志明说：“法军死伤六万人，而由于游击战术的成功，越盟军死伤轻微。法军仅仅只能占领与控制若干大城市，而所有其余的领土大都为越盟军据有并为民主政府所控制。……越南人民相信自己的胜利并准备作任何牺牲，且决心实现越南的完全独立与统一。”\n    　　　　　　　　　　（摘自今年四月二十一日苏联新时代杂志）"

In the Red River Delta area of ​​Tonkin, Viet Minh forces attacked isolated French outposts. A train traveling from Hanoi to Haiphong was struck by a mine planted on the tracks by Viet Minh forces between Hanoi and Gia Lam (the first station on the Hanoi-Haiphong railway line), causing a locomotive and five train cars to derail. At the same time, Hanoi was also attacked by two small teams of Viet Minh forces. In Cochinchina, Viet Minh forces attacked a French military \"defense post\" in Saigon and burned part of a Saigon rubber warehouse, with French officials estimating French losses at $1 million. Small-scale battles took place between French and Vietnamese troops in four areas around Saigon, including Bien Hoa. In Annam, fierce clashes occurred outside Hue, and the enemy garrison at Dong Hoi was attacked by Viet Minh forces.

    "title": "One Year of Veteran Affairs Work in East China",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-22",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th\n\n　　Since the East China Party, government, and military organs issued the \"Decision on Strengthening the Work of Giving Preferential Treatment to Veterans\" and the \"Decision on Unifying and Strengthening the Work of Honoring Military Personnel in East China\" in April last year, the work of veteran affairs has achieved great success in the past year.\n\n　　First, the East China General Administration of Honoring Military Personnel, the East China General School of Honoring Military Personnel, and ten branch bureaus and offices of honoring military personnel, nineteen schools, sanatoriums, reformatories, training regiments, and preferential treatment sections for honoring military personnel in some areas, as well as veteran affairs work groups in various places, were established. In the work, the method of letting veterans manage and educate themselves as much as possible was implemented. At present, 90% of the staff are veterans.\n\n　　Second, veterans have received good recuperation and security after recovering from their injuries. When the Chiang army launched a key offensive against Shandong last year, the schools for honoring military personnel took the initiative to transfer on a large scale to safe areas, and implemented \"relying on the masses, persisting on the spot and dispersed\" in the most difficult times. Although they had difficulty moving and their languages were not very compatible, they suffered no damage in the enemy's offensive because of the good relationship between the military and the people. During the decentralized preparations for war, they helped the masses with production, covered the transfer of the masses, coached the militia, stood guard, participated in battles, uncovered secret agents, conducted propaganda, and persisted in learning.\n\n　　Third, veterans who had recovered their health were mobilized to return to the front line, replenish the troops, or participate in rear work. In one year, there were 15,000 people. Many of them were veteran fighters and cadres who had been tested in battle and learning, and played a backbone role in the troops. For example, Wang Jingtang, who was originally a clerk at a school for honoring military personnel, became a company commander when he went to the front and became a combat hero in the Haiyang battle.\n\n　　Fourth, the three major programs of streamlining, saving, and clearing up materials were implemented. They voluntarily lowered their living standards and enthusiastically donated money and materials to support the front. Some schools and organs also implemented self-transport of grain and grass, self-milling of grain, and production savings. The Eighth School for Honoring Military Personnel gathered more than 630,000 catties of firewood in one march. The first brigade of the Seventh School for Honoring Military Personnel spun thread and earned more than 3.8 million yuan, and cleared out a large number of organ assets.\n\n　　Fifth, the unity between the military and the people was strengthened, and the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers serving the people was maintained and developed. Under the slogans of \"Help with whatever you can do\" and \"Help with whatever the masses need,\" they helped the masses with production. The nine schools for honoring military personnel harvested a total of 14,600 mu, carried 667,000 dan of water, and provided 457,800 dan and 52,000 carts of manure. Comrade Jiang Xuewen, who was deaf in both ears, helped the masses sharpen 1,911 pairs of scissors. The four schools for honoring military personnel plastered 14,923 houses for the masses. At the same time, they saved civilian manpower, compensated for the losses of the masses, and strengthened the connection between the military and the people. The Fifth School for Honoring Military Personnel originally used 185 civilian workers as cooks, but last year all were taken over by veteran comrades. The Seventh School for Honoring Military Personnel publicized 224 times through speeches and meetings, with a total of 80,000 people participating.\n\n　　Sixth, the learning enthusiasm and political and cultural level of the veterans were improved. The pessimistic, disappointed, arrogant, and hedonistic views of a few veterans were overcome, and their class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm were improved. Illiteracy was generally eliminated. In the first squadron of the Fourth School for Honoring Military Personnel, only 5% of the people were illiterate. Among the 1,098 veterans who were originally illiterate in the Third School for Honoring Military Personnel, 127 people can now recognize 700 to 2,800 characters, and 971 people can write practical documents and notes. The veterans all used most of their disability pensions to buy books and pens.\n\n　　The East China veteran affairs work has achieved many of the above achievements in the past year due to the implementation of the correct policy of centralized management and education, and the separate use of talents. However, because it has been in a tense war situation and transfer actions for the past year, and because veteran affairs work is still a new job with insufficient experience, and some cadres have insufficient understanding of veteran affairs work, there are still some shortcomings in the work. Therefore, there are still areas that need to be improved urgently in veteran affairs work. At present, the war situation is developing rapidly, and most of the schools for honoring military personnel have concentrated and summarized the work of the past year, and have gained more experience. The work of veteran affairs is more urgently needed to be strengthened. The East China Bureau and the East China Veterans Affairs Committee have now decided to strengthen veteran education and train veterans to become various construction talents. The East China General School for Honoring Military Personnel is also holding the first East China Veterans Congress to discuss how to implement the decisions of the East China Bureau and the Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一年来华东的荣军工作\n\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一年来华东的荣军工作\n    华东党、政、军机关去年四月发出“加强优待荣军工作的决定”及“统一和加强华东荣誉军人工作决定”后，一年来荣军工作获得很大成绩。\n    第一、建立了华东荣誉军人管理总局、华东荣誉军人总校及十个荣管分局、办事处，十九个荣校、休养院、教养院、教导团及部分地区的政府的荣誉军人优待科和各地荣誉军人小组等荣军工作组织。在工作中，贯彻了尽量由荣誉军人自己管理。教育自己的办法。目前工作人员中，百分之九十是荣誉军人。\n    第二、使荣誉军人在伤愈后获得很好的休养和保障。去年蒋军向山东进行重点进攻时，各荣校主动地大规模地转移至安全地带，在最困难时则实行“依靠群众，就地分散坚持”。他们虽然行动不便，语言不很相通，但因军民关系好，故在敌人进攻中毫无损伤。在分散备战中，他们帮助群众生产，掩护群众转移，教练民兵，站岗放哨，参加战斗，破获特务，进行宣传和坚持学习。\n    第三、动员身体已恢复健康的荣誉军人重上前线，充实部队或参加后方工作，在一年中有一万五千人。其中有许多经过战斗考验和学习的老战士和干部在部队中起了骨干作用。例如王京堂原在荣校任事务长，到了前方当了连长，并在海阳战斗中当了战斗英雄。\n    第四、执行精简、节约、清理资材三大方案，自动降低生活水平，热烈献金、献物支援前线，部分学校机关并实行自运粮草、自磨粮食和生产节约。八荣校在一次行军中即打柴六十三万余斤。七荣校一大队纺线赚钱三百八十余万元，并清理出大批机关资财。\n    第五、加强军民团结，保持和发挥了革命军人为人民服务的光荣传统。他们在“会什么的帮什么”及“群众要什么帮什么”的口号下，帮助群众生产，九个荣校共收割一万四千六百亩，挑水六十六万七千担，出粪、倒粪四十五万七千八百担又五万二千车。两耳失聪的姜学文同志帮助群众磨剪刀一九一把，四个荣校为群众泥房子一四、九二三间。同时，他们又节约民力，赔偿群众损失和加强军民联系。五荣校原用民工一八五人当炊事员，去年全部由荣军同志担任。七荣校用演讲、开会方式宣传了二二四次，总计有八万群众参加。\n    第六、提高了荣军的学习情绪和政治、文化水平。克服了少数荣誉军人的悲观失望、自高自大和享乐观点，提高了他们的阶级觉悟和革命积极性。一般地消灭了文盲，四荣校一中队文盲只剩百分之五，三荣校一、○九八个原不识字的荣军，现能认字七百至二千八百的有一二七人，能写应用文、便条的有九七一人。荣誉军人都把大部分的残废金用之于买书买笔等上面。\n    一年来的华东荣军工作由于执行了集中管理教育，分别量才使用的正确方针，因而获得以上的许多成绩。但是由于一年来经常处于战局紧张转移行动中；又因为荣军工作还是一个新的工作，经验不足，有些干部对荣军工作的认识不足，工作上还有些缺点，因此荣军工作还有急待改进的地方。目前战争形势迅速开展，大部荣校已集中和检查总结了过去一年的工作，获得了更多的经验。荣军工作更迫切需要加强。华东局和华东荣委会现已决定加强荣军教育，培养荣军成为各种建设人材。华东荣军总校并正举行华东第一次荣军大会，讨论如何贯彻华东局和荣委会的决定。　　　　　　　　　　【新华社华东十八日电】"

After 20 days, over 10,000 hectares of good farmland seedlings can be saved. The unit also expects to complete the four main lines in the area, requiring a total of 600,000 workdays, which will enable 60,000 hectares of good farmland to avoid waterlogging disasters for several years. The Nenjiang Military Region Party Committee also issued instructions, mobilizing troops to go to the countryside to help the people rush to weed and plow. A certain unit of the military region has now set off to a certain area to help military families and the poor weed. A company of a certain cavalry regiment, led by the company commander, helped Dagang Village rush to plant more than 300 hectares of flooded land. From the 21st of last month, all units of the Hegang Military Region suspended training and went to the countryside for a week to help the people with summer weeding. A unit of over a thousand people from the military region went to Sujia'an and other areas of Huachuan County, which were severely hit by hail, to help the people weed.

    "content": "Overcoming the Tendency to Pursue Form\n  　Taihang Improves Agricultural Technical Guidance\n    [Taihang Telegram] Taihang agricultural and forestry work overcomes the formalism of being divorced from the masses. Combining farmers' experience and adapting to local conditions, it strengthens technical guidance for agriculture. Since late spring and early summer, local agricultural and forestry bureaus, as well as county, district, and village technical experts, have held technical research meetings to examine, from top to bottom and from bottom to top, the formalism in past work of disregarding specific situations and conditions, mechanically or even forcibly promoting special crops and agricultural technologies to farmers. For example, the \"Golden Queen\" corn, which has been extensively promoted throughout the region since 1944, requires good geological conditions, abundant manure, sparse seedlings, and diligent weeding to yield one to three times more than ordinary local corn. However, some places with poor geological conditions and a lack of manure were also forced to promote it, resulting in lower yields than local corn. The \"169\" wheat, which was promoted at the same time as Golden Queen, yielded high outputs in most areas and was welcomed by farmers. However, some areas were unsuitable for planting due to climate, and jaundice occurred year after year, resulting in very poor harvests. This year, Licheng's wheat generally yielded more than one stone per mu, while the \"169\" wheat suffered severely from jaundice, with some ten mu yielding only a little over one stone. In addition, warm water seed soaking often failed to work or even damaged the seeds because the masses had difficulty grasping the exact time and temperature. Many of the pesticides promoted to control insect pests were simply unknown to the masses or were too expensive or unavailable for them to purchase. These phenomena were not corrected in time, and the masses often sacrificed their own interests and felt dissatisfied because they were \"responding to the call\" and \"taking the lead,\" but they dared not boldly raise the issue. Although the cadres also saw this phenomenon with their own eyes, they often attributed it to the masses' lack of technical expertise and ideological resistance. After this general review, the harm of formalism was deeply recognized, and it was decided to gradually and truly combine improved varieties and improved technologies with farmers' experience to achieve the goal of increasing production. Cadres of local agricultural and forestry bureaus have gone to various counties in the second and third districts to conduct field inspections, overcome past biases, and humbly study and improve farmers' experience. When cadres of the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau assisted in wheat seed selection, they no longer forcibly promoted \"169\" wheat, but rather selected excellent varieties suitable for local conditions after discussion and agreement with the masses. The Shexian Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has universally promoted \"Tu Mai\" (bald wheat) suitable for local conditions and has organized the masses to exchange 380 shi of seeds, which can be planted on 100,000 mu. Linxian has universally promoted \"Shaogu Dan\" wheat, which has a 20-year history and is known as the \"Scholar Wheat.\" It usually yields one or two dou more per mu than other wheat and is very suitable for the dry and rain-scarce natural conditions of the Linxian area. The masses like it very much. This year, Huangniuti and other villages in Lucheng generally selected \"Mao Mai\" (hairy wheat) seeds. This type of wheat matures early, and when jaundice occurs, it immediately produces barren ears, so the disease occurs very rarely. After repeated research and experiments, the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau created a particularly effective, money-saving, and simple method for treating oil drought (cotton seedling pests): Grind one liang of quicklime and two liang of tobacco leaves into a fine powder and put it into 25 jin of clean water. After soaking for half a day, pour out the water, remove the lime residue, and wet the cotton seedlings one by one. The oil drought will die after one day. The masses are very satisfied with this method.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服追求形式偏向　太行改进农业技术指导\n\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　克服追求形式偏向\n  　太行改进农业技术指导\n    【太行电】太行农林工作克服脱离群众的形式主义作风，结合农民经验，适合各地条件，加强对农业的技术指导。春末夏初以来，各地农林局及县区村技术能手，分别召开技术研究会，自上而下和自下而上检查过去工作中不看具体情况与条件，机械甚至强迫农民推广特种作物与农业技术的形式主义。如一九四四年以来即在全区大量推广的“金皇后”玉茭，种植条件必须地质好、粪土大、留苗稀、勤锄，可比一般土玉茭多收一至三倍；但有些地方地质既坏、粪土又缺，也非强迫推广不可，结果反而不如土玉茭打得多。与金皇后同时推广的“一六九”小麦，在大多数地区产量大，农民欢迎。但亦有些地区因气候关系不宜种植，连年发生黄疸，收成很坏。黎城今年小麦普遍收成每亩一石以上，而“一六九”小麦因黄疸病严重，竟有十亩地才收一石多的。另外如温汤浸种，亦因群众很难掌握准确的时间和温度，浸后很少顶事甚至把种籽闹坏了。推广治除虫害的药剂，有很多是群众根本不懂或无钱无处购买的。这些现象没有及时纠正，群众常因“响应号召”、“起带头作用”牺牲了自己利益心里不满，又不敢大胆提出。干部虽也亲眼看到这种现象，但往往推之于群众不会讲究技术、思想抵抗等原因。经过此次普遍检讨，深刻认识了形式主义作风的危害，决定逐步确实作到把改良品种、提高技术与农民的经验相结合，达到增产的目的。各地农林局干部已分别到二、三分区各县实地检查，克服过去偏向，虚心研究与提高农民的经验。长治农林局干部协助小麦选种时，不再强迫推广“一六九”小麦，而是经过群众讨论同意，选择适合当地的优良品种。涉县农林局普遍推广适合当地条件的“秃麦”，已组织群众调换种籽三百八十石，可种十万亩。林县普遍推广有廿年历史，被称为状元麦子的“稍谷旦”小麦，通常比其他小麦每亩多打一、二斗。并很适合林县一带少雨多旱的自然条件。群众非常喜欢。潞城黄牛蹄等村今年多普遍选择“毛麦”种籽，这种小麦成熟期早，到生黄疸病时即莠穗，病害发生很少。邢台农林局经过多次研究实验，创造出效力特大、省钱简便的治油旱（吃棉苗害虫）办法：用一两生石灰、二两烟叶研成细末，放进二十五斤清水。泡大半天，把水倒出，去掉石灰渣，一棵棵浸湿棉苗，一天后油旱即死。这办法群众非常满意。"

    "content": "Ji-Jin Farm\n\n　　Preliminary Experiences in Agricultural Extension\n\n　　Over the past year, the Ji-Jin Farm has gained some preliminary experience in carrying out agricultural extension work: First, it must proceed from reality; the scientific technologies promoted must possess four conditions: simple methods, significant effectiveness, cheap price, and easy-to-find materials, in order to be welcomed by farmers. For example, petroleum emulsion to control aphids and \"PPF\" to kill pear weevils have been very effective. However, they cost too much and the materials are not easy to buy, so the masses do not welcome them. Last year, the farm promoted the use of concentrated tobacco water and lime water to control aphids, diluted flour paste to control spider mites, and red alum, stone alkali noodles, and lime water to control pear weevils. The masses welcomed these methods because these things are easy to find and the price is cheap. Second, the promotion of technology must be carried out in coordination with cadres and the masses, and should not be done solely by farm personnel. The farm sent two or three people to Xizhao Factory in Quyang to spray ten pear trees with medicine to control weevils. The method was simple and the effect was very good, so the masses welcomed it. The county work team immediately mobilized the masses to imitate the spraying, and sprayed 10,000 trees in just a few days, saving a lot of labor for the villagers. The farm also sent seven or eight technical workers to Zhongguantou Village. They did not work with cadres and the masses, and sprayed for nearly sixty days on their own, but the masses did not move, and the technology was not popularized. Third, select key points, use bridges, and gradually promote. Key points should be selected based on: (A) the technical problems that local people most need to solve in agricultural production; (B) villages with model heroes; (C) marketplaces on main traffic routes with high traffic and faster dissemination are the most suitable. At the same time, labor heroes, primary school teachers, experienced old farmers, and village cadres with prestige among the masses should be selected as promotion bridges, provided they are willing. All good varieties and new technologies should first be used by these people as examples, and then the masses should be mobilized to learn, which is easier to accept. Last year, five key villages were identified in Quyang, and each key village focused on promoting only one new technology. Demonstration households were found in each village, and after significant results were achieved, promotion was gradually carried out from one household, one area, and one village. A successful initial effort makes promotion easier. Fourth, calculate accounts and make comparisons to get through ideological barriers. \"It's good, but we can't afford to spend the money,\" said the masses in Anxia Village after seeing the promotion team spraying pear weevils with medicine. At that time, in response to the psychology of the masses, a general meeting was convened to calculate the number of workers and the amount of money spent on beating the weevils, and the amount of money spent on red alum, stone alkali noodles, and lime water to control the weevils, and a comparison was made. Everyone understood that the new method was still cheaper, and the next day ten farmers and village cadres organized and started to take action. Fifth, convene informal, unspecified numbers of old farmers' forums to first learn from their rich experience, and then bring out the new methods or good seeds that we plan to promote for everyone to discuss. Let them express their opinions as much as possible. After research, those that can be promoted locally become their opinions, and those that are not suitable can be modified or abandoned. This is much more effective than rigid and simple top-down communication and deployment. Sixth, last year, the Ji-Jin Farm recruited eleven agricultural technology trainees. During the slack season, they collectively learned general agricultural knowledge in the field. After the spring plowing began, they were divided into groups to go to the countryside to help the masses solve problems such as seed soaking, pear insect control, and weevils. The methods in the notebook were transformed into their true knowledge through personal experience. At the same time, it also powerfully helped the promotion work.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Yang Qingzheng)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀晋农场　农业推广初步经验\n杨清政\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀晋农场\n  　农业推广初步经验\n    冀晋农场一年来举办农业推广工作，开始摸到了几点初步经验：一、必须从现实出发；推行的科学技术必须具备方法简单、效力显著、价钱便宜、材料好找等四个条件，始能得到农民欢迎。如石油乳剂治蚜虫，“ＰＰＦ”杀梨步曲，都收效很大。但花钱太多，材料不易买到，结果群众不欢迎。去年农场所推广的大叶烟水、石灰水治蚜虫，稀面糊水治红蜘蛛，红矾、石咸面、石灰水治梨步曲等办法，群众都很欢迎，因这些东西很容易找，价钱也便宜。二、推广技术必须与干部群众协同一致，不能由农场人员单独去搞。农场派了两三个人到曲阳西赵厂，以药水喷治了十棵梨树的步曲，办法简单，效力很好，群众欢迎。县工作组马上发动群众仿效喷治，在短短的几天内就喷了一万棵，比老乡们打步曲节省了很多劳动力。农场也派了七、八个技术工作者到了中管头村，他们没有协同干部群众一起进行，自己喷治了将近六十天，群众还是不动，技术没有推广开。三、选择重点，通过桥梁，逐步推广。重点选择：（甲）当地群众在农业生产上最需要解决技术问题；（乙）有英模的村庄；（丙）交通要路来往人多，传播较快的集市为最宜。同时应选择群众中有威望的劳动英雄、小学教师、有丰富生产经验的老农和村干部，在其本人自愿的条件下，作为推广桥梁。一切好的品种和新的技术，先发动这些人作个样子，再发动群众学习，较易接受。去年在曲阳确定了五个重点村，一个重点村只着重推广一种新技术。每村找了示范户，作出显著成绩后，再由一户、一片、一村的逐步推广。一炮打响，推广就容易了。四、算帐比较，打通思想。“沾是沾，就是花不起钱”，岸下村群众看了推广小组药杀梨步曲的情形以后这么说。当时便针对着群众这种心理，召开大会，把打步曲用工花钱的数目和红矾、石咸面、石灰水治步曲花钱的数目，算了一笔帐，作了一个对比，大家明白了用新办法还是便宜，第二天就有十个农民和村干部组织起来，开始行动。五、召开不拘形式、不定人数的老农座谈会，先向他们学习丰富的经验，再把我们打算推广的新方法或好种籽拿出来和大家商量。尽量让他们多发表意见，经过研究，可以在当地推行的就变成了他们的意见，不合适的可以修改或放弃，这比生硬简单、由上而下的传达布置要有效的多。六、去年冀晋农场，招收了十一名农业技术练习生，农闲时在场内集体学习一般的农业知识，春耕开始后分组下乡，给群众解决浸种、治梨虫、步曲等问题。把笔记本上的办法经过亲身的体验，变为他们的真知识。同时也有力的帮助了推广工作。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（杨清政）"

Forty-six puppet soldiers and personnel were won over through disintegration. During the wheat protection battle, due to the correct implementation of policies and the combination of military offensives and political offensives, the enemy and puppets were shaken. The puppet self-defense corps of villages such as Moumou sent people to inquire: \"Should we carry the guns issued by the Chiang bandits or not? Can we wear the small floral hats or not?\" And said, \"We will listen to whatever you say.\" The puppet self-defense corps of a certain village even helped us transport public grain. After a family that had fled from Nanzhang Village returned home and was properly resettled by us, they voluntarily returned to the enemy-occupied area to mobilize twenty more fleeing households to return. Many people and puppet personnel in the enemy-occupied area voluntarily requested to pay public grain to our side and did their best to support us. The fighting will of our cadres and the masses has been greatly enhanced. At the same time, due to the leadership of the cadres and the combination of labor and military affairs, the entire county's 25,000 mu of wheat were harvested in seven days, and the planting of 7,100 mu of autumn crops was completed in three days, and all grain storage work was completed within three days.

    "content": "[Northern Yue News] Since the 19th, the entire Northern Yue District has received welcome rain, which has not stopped as of the evening of the 20th. The soil is thoroughly soaked. The peasants are overjoyed and are preparing to replant and rush-plant late autumn crops. According to experienced old farmers: this rain is very even and gentle. He said: This area has been severely dry, and this rain will guarantee the planting of late autumn crops. He also said: There is a lot of rain in the dog days of summer, and the leadership must not become complacent because of this one rain, thinking that everything is fine. They should seize the time to lead the masses to rush-plant and help solve various difficulties, such as adjusting late autumn crop seeds. \"Planting one day earlier means harvesting one day earlier,\" and time cannot be delayed any longer.\n　　[Chahar Electric] From June 29th to July 10th, rain fell successively in various parts of Western Hebei, and most areas have been thoroughly soaked. The drought-stricken seedlings in areas that were not soaked have also recovered. From the 11th, the five special districts of Northern Yue also received widespread and thorough rain.\n　　[Our Newspaper News] Exclusive interview with the General Branch: \"People are worried when it doesn't rain!\" A reporter recently visited the Pingshan First District Government, hoping to get some good news to relieve the worries of the masses. The district party secretary and district head, along with other responsible cadres, went to the county for a meeting to summarize land reform and rectify their thinking, and have not returned for a month. The district committee is empty, and the industrial assistant of the district government has gone to the countryside to supervise the summer grain requisition. Besides the financial assistant organizing accounts, only Secretary Hao is left in the district to be responsible for everything. Secretary Hao said that he is so busy with \"affairs\" that he cannot even take a nap at noon. Indeed, during the one hour that the reporter spoke with him, the courtyard was filled with people waiting to solve problems—land disputes, food and lodging for passing soldiers, approving medical expenses for cadres, water conservancy conflicts, marriages, and divorces... During the conversation, Secretary Hao expressed his hardship due to the lack of cadres. He said: After the land conference last October, the cadres went to the countryside to engage in land reform. On the 18th of last month, they did not return to the district and went to the county for a meeting. Production has not been done well. The position of industrial assistant was only established half a month ago, and the organization is very unsound. Regarding the county government's leadership of production, at first he only thought about the numbers the county wanted—sown area, tree planting and afforestation figures, labor force figures, livestock increase and decrease figures, etc. He said: I can't go down there alone, and I can't get the numbers from the villages, so I haven't completely compiled them. I asked Secretary Hao to find the county's instructions on production. Although there was nothing about drought resistance and famine preparedness (it was heard that the county government's drought resistance instructions had been issued when this article was being written, but they had not been seen), from the county government's instructions on April 12, it seems that the county was paying attention to leading production. After reviewing the inadequacy of production leadership, the instructions pointed out: \"At present, the leadership should seize this busy farming season and quickly turn to production, putting in full effort, especially the district heads should focus on leading production and put most of their energy into leading production work.\" Regarding the content of production work, it briefly stated: \"In-depth education on policies to stabilize and improve the masses' production enthusiasm.\" The method is to \"grasp the key points and drive the general.\" A month later, the county government issued another notice to check production, with the main items being to check whether substitute farming, grain loans, and land reform floating wealth were used for production. Mutual aid and labor allocation should be organized for households lacking labor, and whether land certificates have been issued, etc. On June 7, another emergency notice was issued to concentrate efforts on wheat harvesting, sowing, weeding, and not leaving an inch of land uncultivated. Based on these instructions, the reporter planned to go to key villages to understand the implementation. Secretary Hao said that all villages are the same, with nothing good or bad. The reporter still visited several villages and found that the problem of substitute farming had been preliminarily resolved. When planting in the spring, the fruits of land reform—grain was lent to poor peasants and landlords and rich peasants who had no seeds, which was well done. However, on the other hand, a serious distance was also found between instructions and reality. For example, a lot of irrigated land was abandoned, more than 20 mu in Mengling, 30 mu in Yongle, and 20 mu in Yiyang. Due to the drought, how much dry land was abandoned could not be calculated for a while. According to village cadres: these were all taken away from landlords and rich peasants, and some middle and poor peasants also abandoned them because there was no one at home or a lack of labor. The masses in waterless areas automatically requested to plant the abandoned irrigated land. Two households in Dongjiao planted 4 mu of the Yanbao village, willing to pay the burden themselves. There are still 4 mu in this village that no one has planted. The masses in Yanbao planted 20 mu of irrigated land in Mengling and Qudi. In order to stabilize and improve production enthusiasm, it is urgently necessary to determine land rights. The county government's May production inspection notice listed the issuance of land certificates as an item, but a village branch secretary said: The superiors always say to issue land certificates, they have said it three times, but they have not been issued, and they don't know why. The issue of organizing the masses for mutual aid in production seems to be still in the debate stage. The county government's instructions on April 12 did not mention this at all. Secretary Hao of the district government said: Irrigated land has a lot of scattered occupations, and it is often busy, so mutual aid is inconvenient. The county government has instructed to organize mutual aid and labor allocation for households lacking labor. The reporter asked village cadres in many ways, and the answers were either that the masses naturally helped each other solve the problem, or that the land of households lacking labor was not much and there was no problem. The reporter felt that although some problems had been solved in rural production in Pingshan First District, it had not formed an organized mass movement. Drought resistance and famine preparedness have not created a mass upsurge. Although the county's leadership has a policy for production, there is no specific organization for implementation, and there are instructions, but no inspection or supervision. As a result, the policies and instructions cannot be well realized. The masses in a certain village said that to resist drought and prepare for famine, they should now plant more vegetables, yams, radishes, and turnips, which can be harvested a lot and can last for half a year. If it rains in the second heat, they can plant buckwheat, but they can't buy buckwheat seeds. Some of the masses have dry land sandwiched in the middle of irrigated land and demand to irrigate it like last year; some poor peasants lack fertilizer too much... Regarding these demands, the leadership has not yet timely organized the masses to help them realize them to the greatest extent possible within the limits of possibility. Some cadres have relaxed their leadership of production in their thinking. Secretary Hao of the district government said: \"The masses' production enthusiasm is still high, and they can do it without leadership.\" This is a laissez-faire attitude towards production leadership, and this idea must be overcome, and the leadership should earnestly check it.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳区喜雨赶快抢种　平山一区生产自流应立即改变\n\n1948-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳区喜雨赶快抢种\n  　平山一区生产自流应立即改变\n    【北岳讯】北岳全区从十九日起降喜雨，迄二十日晚未停。地里都已下透。农民们喜形于色，纷纷准备补种和抢种晚秋。据有经验的老农民谈：这雨阴的甚匀，下的很缓，他说：这一带旱的太厉害了，有这一场雨，能保证种上晚秋。又说：伏天用雨很多，领导上绝不能因为下了这一场雨，思想上就麻痹起来，认为已经万事大吉。应该抓紧时间，领导群众抢种，帮助解决各种困难问题，如调剂晚秋作物种子等。“早种一天早收一天”，时间已经不能再拖延了。\n    【察哈尔电】自上月二十九号至本月十号，平西各地相继落雨，大部地区已下透，未透地区受旱禾苗也已转缓过来。北岳五专各地从十一日起亦普降透雨。\n    【本报讯】总分社专访：“不下雨人们可愁了！”记者日前走访平山一区区政府，希望得到一些为群众解愁的好消息。该区区委书记及区长等负责干部到县里开会总结土改、整顿思想，为时一月尚未归来。区委会空无一人，区政府实业助理员下乡督促夏征，区上除财政助理员在整理帐目外，只留郝秘书一人负责一切。郝秘书说光“事务”就忙得连午睡都不能歇。真的，记者与他谈话的一点钟内，院里挤满群众，等候解决问题——土地纠纷，过路军人的食宿问题，批干部医药费，水利矛盾，结婚离婚…………。谈话中间，郝秘书表示很以干部缺乏为苦。他说：从去年十月土地会议后，干部都下乡搞土改，上月十八日他们没有回区，就都到县上开会去了。生产没有好好搞，实业助理员这个职位才确定了半个月，机构很不健全。关于县政府对生产的领导，开始他只想到县上要数目字的事——播种面积，植树造林数字，劳动力数字，牲畜增减数字等等。他说：我一个人也下不去，往村里要不上来，我也没有完全统计好。我请郝秘书找出县上有关生产的指示，其中虽然没有关于抗旱备荒的东西（写稿时闻县府抗旱指示下来了，但未见到），但从四月十二日县政府的指示看来，县上是注意领导生产的。该指示在检讨生产领导不够之后，即指出：“目前领导上应抓紧这一农忙季节，很快转入生产，把劲头使足，尤其是各区长应以领导生产为主，把绝大部分力量放在生产工作领导上”。关于生产工作的内容，略称：“深入政策的教育，稳定与提高群众生产情绪”。方法是“抓紧重点，带动一般。”隔了一个月，县政府又发出一个检查生产的通告，主要项目为检查代耕、贷粮贷款及土改浮财是否用于生产。缺乏劳力户应组织互助拨工，并问发下土地证没有等。六月七日，又发了集中力量进行麦收、播种、锄苗、不荒一分地的紧急通告。根据这些指示，记者打算到重点村了解一下执行情形。郝秘书说各村都一样，没有什么好坏。记者还是访问了几个村庄，发现代耕问题已获得初步解决。春季下种时，土改果实——粮食借给无种子的贫农及地主富农，办的也不错。但是另一方面，也发现指示与实际中间存在着严重的距离。譬如水浇地荒芜了不少，孟岭有二十余亩，永乐三十来亩，义羊二十余亩，旱地因为天旱，究竟荒了多少，一时统计不出来。据村干部谈：这些都是抽换给地主富农的，也有个别中贫农因家里没人或缺乏劳力而荒的。无水地的群众，自动要求种荒芜的水地，东焦两户群众就种了烟堡村四亩，自己情愿出负担。该村还有四亩尚无人种。烟堡群众则种了孟岭、曲堤二十来亩水地。为稳定与提高生产情绪，目前亟需应该确定地权。县府五月生产检查通告曾把发土地证列为一项，但是某村支部书记说：上边老说发土地证，说了三次了，还没有发下来，不知道为什么？关于组织群众生产互助问题，似乎还停留在争论阶段，县政府四月十二日的指示根本未提此事，区政府郝秘书说：水地零碎营生多，经常忙，互助起来倒不方便。县府曾指示对缺乏劳力户要组织互助拨工，记者多方问村干部，所得回答不是说群众自然的就互相帮忙解决了，就是说缺乏劳力户的地都为数不多，没有问题。记者觉得平山一区农村生产中虽有若干问题已经解决，但还没有形成有组织的群众运动。抗旱备荒也没有造成群众热潮。县的领导上对于生产虽有方针，但没有具体组织执行，有指示，没有检查督促。结果方针指示都不能很好实现。某村群众说要抗旱备荒，现在就要多种菜、山药、萝卜、蔓菁。收的很多，可顶半年粮。二伏下了雨，可以种荞麦，但是买不到荞麦种子。有的群众有夹在水地中间的旱地，要求象去年一样浇水；有的贫农肥料太缺乏………对于这些要求，还未见领导上及时的组织群众，在可能范围内，以最大的努力助其实现。有些干部思想上放松了生产领导，区政府郝秘书说：“群众生产情绪还高，不用领导，也一样的干得起来”。这就是对生产领导的放任自流思想，这种思想必须加以克服，领导上应切实加以检查。"

In 1930, he served as the captain of the \"Bandit Suppression\" propaganda team in Gu Zhutong's bandit troops. The following year, the team was reorganized into the notorious Special Operations Unit, with Kang continuing as the commander until the unit was disbanded after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1932, he participated in initiating the core organization of the China Military Fascist organization, the Renaissance Society, and presided over its Cultural Department, one of the six major departments. He also served as the secretary of the Renaissance Society, leading all of its secret service work. He was one of the famous so-called \"Four King Kongs\" and \"Thirteen Taibao\" of the society. In order to train secret service personnel, Kang Ze organized the so-called \"Xingzi Special Training Class\" in Xingzi Town, Jiangxi, and from 1933 to 1939, he served as the director of the \"Jiangling Central Military Academy Special Training Class\" in Jiangling, Hubei, which was of the same nature. In 1935, he and He Guoguang guided Chiang Kai-shek's forces into Sichuan, and concurrently served as the so-called \"Director of the Political Training Department of the Sichuan Headquarters,\" where he carried out large-scale anti-communism and massacred many revolutionary patriots in the province. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in 1938, he served as the director of the Second Department of the Political Department of the Military Commission in Wuhan, specializing in developing his criminal anti-communist secret service work in the Kuomintang army. After the establishment of the semi-fascist so-called Three People's Principles Youth League in 1939, he served as the central standing director and director of the organization department of the league until 1945, further spreading the fascist poison among some young people. In the spring of 1940, a rice-snatching incident occurred in Chengdu, and he took the opportunity to go there to arrest communists and revolutionary youth. In 1945, he was elected as a member of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and served as a member of the \"Special Committee of the Central Party Headquarters,\" the party's highest anti-communist organization. This year, after Chiang Kai-shek suffered disastrous defeats everywhere, he attempted to resist the People's Liberation Army's offensive by implementing the so-called \"pacification system\" of total war, and established the Fifteenth Pacification Zone in Xiangyang, northern Hubei, with Kang Ze as the commander. Earlier this month, in battles with the People's Liberation Army, Kang instructed his troops to release large amounts of poison gas.

    "content": "\"Drink a Little Cabbage Soup and Surrender at the First Shot\"\n　　Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Local Teams Not Worth a Single Blow from Our Army\n　　[Jidong Telegraph] Frontline reporter Zhang Fan reports: After Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandits implemented the strategy of \"using main forces against main forces,\" they had to hand over the defense of their points and lines to their local teams. However, these teams were extremely weak in combat and could not withstand a single blow. In the Jidong campaign, from June 2nd to June 25th, in 24 days, our army annihilated the entire 21st, 27th, and 37th regiments of the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit local security forces, as well as the entire 7th Regiment of the bandit Hebei Provincial Guard, and the 2nd Battalion of the 28th Security Regiment. Huang Re, the Education Director of the Chiang Kai-shek Central Training Corps, held a meeting in June to review the local teams in various regions, with the participation of various departments of the bandit Ministry of National Defense. The meeting concluded that the lack of combat effectiveness of the security teams was due to: \"Too few personnel, too poor treatment, disturbing the people even more than the 'National Army,' openly selling guns, and the 'Central Government' not issuing weapons.\" (Guo Yimin's letter to Zhu Fawu, the head of the bandit 7th Guard Regiment) In response, the bandit Ministry of National Defense did allow improvements, but lacked confidence: \"Provincial funds are too difficult, so the organization (referring to local teams) is smaller, coupled with embezzlement and desertion, the actual count is only about 500 (referring to the general case). Although this year's organization has been increased, it still feels like there are too few people.\" (Ibid.) Facts have proven that no matter whether the Chiang Kai-shek bandit local teams have the same weapons and treatment as the bandit regular army, and no matter whether their personnel are increased, their fate of being annihilated is sealed. The bandit Hebei Guard 7th Regiment, which guarded Shixia, received eleven machine guns, three mortars, and some rifles on June 18th, and was completely captured by the People's Liberation Army, along with its personnel and weapons, after only two hours of combat the next day. The entire 8th Traffic Police Brigade and most of the 5th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's Tang Zong special agent system, despite their good weapons and equipment, could not avoid being annihilated. Today, the insurmountable difficulties of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's insufficient troops and low morale are even more obvious. In the battle to capture Xiaoying on the Pinggu Road, as soon as contact was made, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the bandit Hebei Security 28th Regiment ordered his troops to surrender. A song full of defeatism is now circulating among the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi troops: \"Eat rice and charge, stand guard and look at the terrain, half-full of dry rice, no energy, drink a little cabbage soup, and surrender at the first shot.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “喝点白菜汤一打就缴枪”　蒋匪地方团队不值我军一击\n张帆\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“喝点白菜汤一打就缴枪”\n  　蒋匪地方团队不值我军一击\n    【冀东电】前线记者张帆报导：蒋傅匪实行“以主力对主力”后，其点线不得不交给其地方团队守备，但此等团队战斗力极弱，不堪一击。我军在冀东作战，从六月二日到二十五日二十四天中，即歼灭了蒋傅匪地方保安团第二十一、二十七、三十七团全部，及匪河北省守护第七团全部，保安二十八团二营。蒋匪中央训练团教育长黄热曾于六月间开会检讨各地地方团队，匪国防部各厅处均参加。会中认为各保安团队之没有战斗力，其原因是：“人数过少，待遇太差，扰民情形，比‘国军’尤甚，公开卖枪，‘中央’不发武器。”（郭一民给匪守护第七团团长朱法武的信）对此，匪国防部虽曾允许改善，但却缺乏信心：“省费太困难，故编制（指地方团队）较小，再加吃空逃亡，实计不过五百左右（系指一般者）。虽本年编制已增大，但仍感人少。”（同上）事实证明，不管蒋匪地方团队武器待遇与匪正规军相同也好，不管其人员增加也好，其被歼的命运是注定了的。守石匣的匪河北守护第七团，于六月十八日接到运来的十一挺机关枪，和三门迫击炮及一部步枪，第二天经过两小时的战斗，便被人民解放军连人带武器全部俘获了。蒋匪唐纵特务系统的交警第八总队全部及第五总队大部，武器装备虽好，但也不能避免被歼。今天蒋傅匪兵力不足，士气低落的不可克服的困难是更加明显了。在平古路攻克小营的战斗中，刚一接触，匪河北保安二十八团二营营长，便下令缴枪投降。现蒋傅匪军中，流行着一首充满失败情绪的歌谣：“吃饭打冲锋，站岗看地形，半饱干饭干的没有劲，喝点白菜汤，一打就缴枪。”"

    "content": "Forty Taels of Gold\n    Yang Shuo\n    On June 14th, the People's Liberation Army launched a surprise attack on Zhenzi Town, located on the side of the Beining Railway north of Tangshan in eastern Hebei, annihilating the entire First Battalion of the 451st Regiment of the 151st Division of the enemy's 62nd Army. When the People's Liberation Army was inspecting the captured weapons, they felt something hard and bulky wrapped around the waist of Wang Shangbin, the enemy's Major Battalion Commander. Wang Shangbin's face immediately turned pale, and he stammered, \"This is a little gold.\" It wasn't a little, but a full forty taels: gold bars, gold ingots, and gold leaves of various types. This was a private fortune he had painstakingly accumulated during his five years as battalion commander. Actually, it wasn't surprising; according to prisoners, Tao Xiangfu, the commander of the 451st Regiment, had likely amassed four or five hundred taels of gold. These Jiang family officers valued gold as much as their lives. When the artillery fire intensified, Wang Shangbin hadn't forgotten to quickly take out his treasure from the bottom of the box and strap it to his stomach, not expecting that at this moment, he would helplessly watch the People's Liberation Army soldier who was inspecting him find his gold. His heart felt as if it were being cut out, and he assumed that everything was over. However, after the People's Liberation Army soldier finished inspecting, he calmly handed it back to him, saying, \"Keep it with you, no one will touch it!\" He simply couldn't believe it was true. How could the People's Liberation Army be so indifferent to the gold that Jiang family soldiers coveted? Harboring ulterior motives, he was transferred from the front lines to the rear, but no one ever touched his gold. In early July, just as he had come, he was safely released by the People's Liberation Army with his forty taels of gold, not a bit missing. Only then did he realize with great emotion that while gold was valuable, there was something even more noble than gold in the People's Liberation Army: this was the solemn revolutionary discipline, which included the discipline of treating prisoners of war with leniency, and within the discipline of treating prisoners of war with leniency, there was a rule that \"private property of prisoners will not be confiscated.\"\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　[Jidong Dispatch]\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四十两金子\n杨朔\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　四十两金子\n    杨朔\n    六月十四日，解放军奇袭冀东唐山北面北宁路侧的榛子镇，守敌六十二军一五一师四五一团一营全部被歼。解放军动手检查俘获的武器时，一摸摸到敌少校营长王尚斌的腰下缠着些硬绑梆的东西，王尚斌立时脸色苍白，嗫嚅着说：“这是一点金子。”不是一点，而是足足有四十两重：金条、金锭、金叶子各色齐全。这是他当五年营长期间用尽心机捞的一笔私财。其实也不稀奇，据俘虏说，四五一团团长陶相甫搜刮的金子怕有四五百两。这些蒋家军官，把金子看得和命一样重。当王尚斌在炮火紧时，还没有忘记从箱子底层赶快拿出他的宝藏，贴身绑到肚皮上，不想此刻竟眼睁睁地望着那个检查他的解放军战士搜出了他的金子，一颗心就象叫人剜去似的伤痛，料定什么都完了。可是那个解放军战士检查完后，神色不动的重新递给他说：“你带着吧，没人动你的！”他简直不敢相信这是真的，怎么蒋家官兵看得眼红的金子，解放军会看得那样淡漠？怀着鬼胎从前线被转送到后方，但始终没人动他的金子。七月初，他象来时一样，带着四十两金子，分毫不缺，安安全全地被解放军释放了，他这才大大感动地看清一件事实：金子虽然值钱，但在解放军里却有比金子更加高贵的东西，这就是庄严的革命纪律，这里包括优待俘虏的纪律，而在优待俘虏纪律里，正有一条是“不没收俘虏的私人财产”。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【冀东电】"

    "content": "Support the Wheat Protection Struggle in the Border Areas of Bo'ai and Other Places\n  　Lingchuan Militia Returns Home Victoriously\n    [Taihang Electric] The Lingchuan militia, who supported the struggle to protect wheat in the border areas of Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, and Wuzhi, have gloriously completed their mission and returned home victoriously after forty days of arduous combat assistance and harvesting. They engaged in a total of 53 battles, large and small, killing, wounding, and capturing 60 enemy bandits. They assisted the masses in production, contributing a total of 18,960 workdays. During the battles, they constantly received praise from the local masses and rewards from the government. The Xue Huaifu team, at Beiguanzhuang in Wuzhi, repelled grain-grabbing enemies who outnumbered them several times, killing two and wounding one, while covering the safe transfer of the masses. The county headquarters specially awarded them a bonus of 35,000 yuan in local currency (冀钞, Jì chāo, hereinafter the same). The Zhao Xiyin team, operating in the Shangtun area of Bo'ai, was known for its bravery and skill in battle, and was praised by the masses as the \"Second Regiment\" (the \"Second Regiment\" refers to the 772nd Regiment of the 386th Brigade of the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army, which fought in the Taihang Mountains at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. This regiment fought against the Japanese invaders and was invincible; everyone in the Taihang Mountains knew of it). They held a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other, helping the masses harvest and transport wheat on 356 mu during combat breaks, threshing 63 shi of wheat, and planting autumn crops on 37 mu. The Xue Huaifu team, operating in the Xiaozhuang area of Wuzhi, often assigned a squad to combat duty while the majority of the force helped the masses with quick harvesting, threshing, and storage. When they left, the masses were reluctant to part with them. In addition to combat and production, the Han Rantu team vigorously promoted the Outline Land Law, persuading many fugitive households to return home; eight families returned to Yangzhuang, Jiaozuo, in just one day. After forty days of training in the wheat protection struggle, the militia's combat effectiveness has improved. When the Zhao Xiyin team cooperated with the main force in attacking Beizhu Village, they independently blocked the enemy reinforcements from the east and west of Fengfeng, completing the task. When attacking Xifengfeng, the militiamen cooperated with the troops to enter the village and shouted to the enemy. The militia's fighting spirit remained high until they returned home victoriously.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 支援博爱等边地护麦斗争　陵川民兵胜利还乡\n\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　支援博爱等边地护麦斗争\n  　陵川民兵胜利还乡\n    【太行电】支援博爱、焦作、武陟边地保麦斗争的陵川民兵，经过四十天艰苦的作战助收，现已光荣完成任务，胜利返乡。总共大小战斗五十三次，毙伤俘敌匪六十名。帮助群众生产，共用一万八千九百六十个工。在战斗中他们不断得到当地群众的赞扬和政府的奖励。薛怀富队于武陟北官庄阻击数倍于自己的抢粮敌人，毙敌二名，伤敌一名，掩护群众安全转移。该县指挥部特发给奖金洋三万五千元（冀钞，下同）。活动于博爱上屯一带之赵希印队以勇敢善战，群众誉之为“老二团”（老二团系指抗战开始时转战太行山的八路军一二九师三八六旅七七二团。该团与日寇作战，战无不胜，攻无不克，太行妇孺皆知）。他们一手拿枪，一手拿镰，在战斗空隙里帮助群众收麦运麦三百五十六亩，打麦六十三石，种秋三十七亩。薛怀富队在武陟小庄一带活动，以一个班经常担任战斗勤务，大部力量帮助群众快收、快打、快藏。他们走时，群众依依不舍。韩软土队除战斗生产外，并大力宣传土地法大纲，争取许多逃亡户回家，焦作杨庄一天即回来八家。经过四十天保麦斗争的锻炼，民兵的战斗力提高了一步。赵希印队配合主力打北朱村时，曾独挡一面阻击东、西冯封敌之援兵，完成了任务。打西冯封时，民兵们配合部队打进村内，并向敌喊话。民兵战斗情绪一直饱满，直到胜利返乡。"

Before being liberated, the officers and soldiers of this Guangdong unit, like other Kuomintang officers and soldiers, were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda, and many of them doubted the People's Liberation Army's policy towards prisoners. But now, from their own personal experience, they have understood the true situation. Guo Jiesheng, the company commander of the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 151st Division, recalled happily: \"As soon as I laid down my weapon, the People's Liberation Army brothers said to me: 'If you lay down your weapon, we are friends. Don't worry, don't be afraid.' Their attitude was very kind, which immediately changed my impression of the People's Liberation Army. But I still had 19 million in legal tender and a watch on me, and I thought: the People's Liberation Army will definitely take these, and I will never be able to keep them. So I gave my watch to a People's Liberation Army brother, but that brother immediately shook his head and said, 'That's not allowed. The discipline of our People's Liberation Army does not allow this.'\" Wu Hua, the company commander of the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 451st Regiment, used to be skeptical about the People's Liberation Army's lenient policy. When he was about to be liberated, he thought: the People's Liberation Army would probably be unkind to captured officers, so he changed his clothes, threw away the American herringbone wool hat he was wearing, put on a hat from a logistics soldier, and also threw away his clothes and blankets. Now he says regretfully: \"What a pity! If I had known that the People's Liberation Army would treat us who laid down our weapons so well, I would have brought everything with me.\" He Chunbin, the battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 471st Regiment, knew a little about the People's Liberation Army's lenient policy, so he was not very afraid after laying down his weapon, and brought his clothes, quilt, blanket, and rucksack, and even brought a thermos. And he continued to write a diary along the way. In his diary, he wrote: \"The People's Liberation Army prepared cars to carry the luggage that we couldn't carry and the officers and soldiers who couldn't walk. What was most unexpected was that when we were tired and couldn't carry our luggage, the People's Liberation Army soldiers would carry it for us. This is absolutely impossible in our army (referring to the Kuomintang army).\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 放下武器就是朋友\n\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　放下武器就是朋友\n    【冀东电】今年六月间，蒋军六十二军一五七师和一五一师各一部，在滦县榛子镇，唐山野鸡坨、任各庄一带，被人民解放军解放了。这个广东部队的官兵在被解放以前，也和其他蒋军官兵一样，因受蒋介石的宣传欺骗，很多人怀疑解放军的俘虏政策，但是现在从他们自己亲身的经验中，使他们明白了真实的情形。一五一师二营六连连长郭杰生很愉快的回忆说：“我一放下武器，解放军弟兄们就对我说：‘你放下了武器，我们就是朋友了，放心吧，不要怕。’他们的态度很和好，使我对解放军的印象马上不同。不过我身上还有一千九百万法币和一只手表，我心想：这些一定被解放军拿去，我再也保不住它们了。我就把我的手表送给一个解放军弟兄，那弟兄马上摇头说：‘这可不行，我们解放军的纪律不允许这样。’”四五一团一营三连长伍花以前对解放军的宽大政策半信半疑，在快被解放的时候，心想：解放军捉住当官的大概不客气，于是他就换了装，把头上戴的美国人字呢帽扔掉，拿勤务兵的一顶帽子戴上，同时还把衣服毯子都扔掉。现在他懊悔地说：“真可惜！早知解放军对我们放下武器的人这样好，我什么也会带着。”四七一团三营营长何淳斌因为略微知道一点解放军的宽大政策，所以放下武器后并不很害怕，把自己的衣服、被子、毛毯图囊都带着，连暖水瓶也拿来了。并且一路上还照常写日记。在他的日记上写着：“在行进中我们背不动的行李及走不得的官兵，解放军都预备着车子载运。最出人意料的是，当我们累了背不动行李时，解放军战士们还替我们背。我们部队里（即指蒋军里）是绝对做不到的。”"

    "content": "Li Chungou Overcomes Spontaneous Mutual Aid, Strengthens Leadership in Agriculture and Sideline Occupations\n　　[Taihang News] Li Chungou in the Fifth District of Lucheng strengthens production leadership and overcomes the spontaneous phenomenon of mutual aid groups, going all out for agricultural and sideline production. This spring, the masses were not enthusiastic when reorganizing the mutual aid groups. Later, after a forced reorganization, a plan was drawn up to complete sowing by the fifth day of the fourth lunar month, but some group leaders still did not dare to lead boldly and actively. Spontaneous production occurred within the groups, with democracy being mistaken for doing whatever one wanted. As a result, sowing was not completed until the fifteenth day of the fourth month, delayed by ten days. At the mass production meeting on the sixth of this month to review spring plowing and sowing, Hao Facheng, chairman of the farmers' association, first reviewed the lack of leadership in production work, because cadres had not been democratic enough in the past, made many mistakes, and were now afraid of making mistakes and dared not lead. After group discussions, the reasons for the poor performance of the mutual aid groups were identified: First, there was a misunderstanding of democracy, with no leadership needed. For example, Hao Tianfu said: \"This year's mutual aid group is spontaneous, and the land can be cultivated well!\" He did not consider that there was no participation in the war this year, and the grain transport tasks. If there were these tasks, the spring plowing and sowing would not be completed. Second, in the past, mutual aid relied on administrative orders, divorced from the masses. During the \"three搶 (qiang)\" campaign last year, the higher authorities called for completing the autumn harvest and autumn plowing tasks in twenty days. Small groups challenged each other in competitions, harvesting crops at night, and wasting beans on the ground. Some even cut green crops, reducing yields, which affected the masses' willingness to engage in mutual aid. After a heated discussion, everyone agreed that: a lone bird cannot form a flock, and a lone tree cannot form a forest, only by organizing can the land be cultivated well. Liang Madou, the branch secretary, said: \"Everyone mentioned that when organizing mutual aid groups last year, the cadres subjectively issued administrative orders, which caused losses to the masses during the three搶 campaign. These are all the mistakes of the cadres and should be self-examined.\" Then, using the accounting method, it was pointed out that since the village's liberation, twenty-eight livestock and twenty-five carts had been added, all of which were bought by saving labor and earning money from transportation after organizing. This account enlightened the masses to further realize that doing a good job in mutual aid is a good way to get rich. Then, the whole village made a plan to organize weeding, combined with transportation. A total of one hundred and fifty-five full, half, and auxiliary laborers were converted into labor force, only one hundred and thirty were needed to complete weeding, and the other twenty-five laborers drove twenty-five carts for transportation.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Jing Tang, Liu @, Shao Shun)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李村沟克服互助自流现象　加强领导农副业\n景堂　骝＠　绍舜\n1948-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李村沟克服互助自流现象\n  　加强领导农副业\n    【太行讯】潞城五区李村沟加强生产领导，克服互助组自流现象，全力进行农副业生产。今春整顿互助组时，群众就不热心。以后勉强整顿了，订出计划要在阴历四月初五日全部完成下种，但有的组长仍不敢大胆积极去领导，组内自流生产，把民主当成想干啥就干啥，结果四月十五日才下完种，拖长时间十天。本月六号群众生产大会上检查春耕下种，农会主席郝发成，首先检讨生产工作缺乏领导，是因为干部过去不够民主，犯了好多错误，现在怕犯错误，不敢领导了。后分组酝酿，找出互助组搞不好的原因：第一是误解民主，不要领导，如郝天福说：“今年互助组自流，地可种好啦”！他没有想到今年没有参战，运粮任务，如有这些任务，就完成不了春耕下种。第二、过去互助行政命令，脱离了群众，去年三抢运动，上级号召二十天完成秋收秋耕任务，小组里挑战竞赛，黑夜收割庄稼，把豆粒都糟踏在地里；还有的割了青庄稼，收成减少，影响群众不愿互助。经过热烈的讨论，大家一致认为：孤鸟不成群，孤树不成林，只有组织起来才能把地种好。支部书记梁马斗说：“大家提的去年组织互助组时，干部主观行政命令，在三抢运动中使群众受了损失，这都是干部的错误，应作自我检查”。接着即用算帐方法，指出该村解放到现在，增加了二十八个牲口、大车二十五辆，都是组织起来省下工、搞运输赚了钱买下的。这笔帐启发群众进一步认识了搞好互助是发家致富的好办法。接着全村便订下计划，组织起来锄苗，并结合运输进行。男女全半劳力及辅助劳力共折合劳力一百五十五个，只用一百三十个就能完成锄苗，另二十五个劳力赶上二十五辆大车运输。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（景堂、骝＠、绍舜）"

    "content": "Checking the Implementation of Resolutions is a Basic Method of Bolshevik Leadership\n    *Pravda* Editorial\n  　It is common knowledge that a correct policy is the source of victory. However, this does not equal victory itself. Victory does not come on its own; it must be organized and fought for.\n    Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of the relationship between policy lines and organizational work. He said: \"After a correct line has been formulated, and a correct resolution has been made on the problem, the success or failure of the matter depends on the organizational work, the correct selection of personnel, and the inspection of the degree of implementation by various leading organs. Otherwise, the party's correct line and resolutions will suffer serious damage. Not only that, after a correct policy line has been formulated, organizational work will determine everything, even the fate of the policy line itself—success or failure.\"\n    The reason why Bolshevik policies can achieve continuous victories is that the party constantly uses all its strength to carry out organizational work to ensure the realization of its policy line. Our party is carrying out arduous work—mobilizing the broad masses of people to complete the historical task of communist construction.\n    Lenin and Stalin taught us: The most important thing in organizational work is to select cadres and check on implementation. As long as the party organization follows this instruction, it can make Bolshevik leadership methods gain benefits in all aspects of our great construction.\n    The current party representative meetings point out that in order to improve the economy and culture in the post-war period, the party organization is carrying out enthusiastic and comprehensive work, giving play to the great strength of the Soviet people, their enthusiasm, and their firm spirit in overcoming difficulties. The party organization initiated a socialist competition among the people to strive to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. After the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on literature and art issues was promulgated, organizations in various places paid more attention to ideological education work. Many party organizations have accumulated rich experience in mass propaganda and mobilization. Party cadres firmly grasp the art of Bolshevik leadership and improve their ideological and theoretical level.\n    However, many representative meetings also pointed out the serious shortcomings in the leadership methods of party organizations. There are still such staff who only pay attention to meetings, preparing resolutions, and making resolutions. After the resolution is made, they often forget these resolutions completely. What will happen to the made resolutions in practice, to what extent can they be realized, whether all agencies have taken action, what difficulties have been encountered; what supplementary measures need to be taken to ensure the smooth progress of the matter—not enough attention is paid to all of these. For example, the party representative meeting of the Chkalov Oblast pointed out that the Oblast Party Committee and some District Party Committees weakened the inspection of the implementation of their resolutions. The Oblast Party Committee and the District Party Committee relied only on the activities of their small groups for the implementation of resolutions, and failed to mobilize party cadres and Soviet cadres and the broad masses of workers to actively participate in the work. The method of dispatching plenipotentiaries in desperation has become the main means of leadership here. Daily meticulous mass work and guidance to cadres are often replaced by the transmission of countless resolutions and the sending of telegrams.\n    Such a leadership method can create an illusion, that is: If the Party Committee can make a large number of resolutions and send many telegrams to various places, it seems to indicate that it is indeed working hard enough. But in fact, it is precisely because the party organs are busy with these tasks that they cannot widely and comprehensively promote the progress of things. In this way, it is not possible to give full play to the existing possibilities for improving all work.\n    The Bolshevik leadership principle requires that after a resolution is made, a plan and strategy must be made to ensure the implementation of this resolution. In one case, it is necessary to send one or a group of experienced staff to the site. In another case, it is necessary to give assistance in materials, technology, and equipment. In short, organizing the implementation of resolutions means mobilizing countless cadres of the Party and the Soviets to work actively, leading the broad masses of people to overcome difficulties, and ensuring the completion of the country's current tasks at the Bolshevik work speed. Working with cadres, giving them practical help, and guiding them are the main aspects of inspection. The responsibility of the Party Committee is to make the staff understand the essence of the tasks they are performing, to make them understand how they can better implement the resolutions, and what organizational form is best to increase the Party's power to mobilize the masses and ensure the resolution of the current tasks of the Party organization.\n    Checking the implementation is the most effective weapon of the party organization. However, the following points must be strictly observed:\n    First, the inspection of the degree of implementation must be systematic, not episodic. That is to say, after the resolution is made, immediately urge the implementation of the resolution without hesitation or waiting. The Party Committee must understand the daily life of the organization. Only in this way can it intervene at any time and correct the work when necessary. In this way, the inspection of the degree of implementation can discover the chaos in a certain paragraph of the work at any time and find out the person responsible for the chaos in time. Only by inspecting the degree of implementation at any time and systematically can errors and shortcomings be prevented, and only in this way can the Party Committee help its local organizations in a timely manner. Checking the implementation is a powerful weapon for party organizations to educate cadres with Bolshevik responsibility and discipline.\n    Second, the inspection of the degree of implementation should not be the responsibility of minor staff, but should be done by the leaders themselves. Lenin demanded that the leaders of all organizations and agencies must \"control in their own hands\" experienced and capable staff under their leadership \"to check the progress of actual work\" and entrust \"someone to go there, inspect, check, and hold you responsible if something goes wrong.\" Comrade Stalin once instructed: The leader's personal inspection of the work is one of the most important conditions that can make the work inspection effective.\n    Third, the inspection of the degree of implementation should not be based solely on formal reports, but should first be inspected at the workplace based on the actual results of the work.\n    Fourth, the inspection of the degree of implementation must be objective and strict. Only by unfolding Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism can shortcomings be exposed in time and methods for correcting shortcomings be formulated. There must be no fraud or favoritism in solving all problems when inspecting the degree of implementation. Where this non-Bolshevik atmosphere develops, irresponsibility will arise, followed by indifference and disloyalty to the interests of the country. Covering up shortcomings should not be done, sharp Bolshevik criticism should be unfolded, and a very strict attitude should be taken towards it, not tolerance—this is an important condition for making the inspection of the degree of implementation effective.\n    Checking the implementation is a basic method of Bolshevik leadership. The results of checking the implementation can reflect the Party Committee's entire leadership style and its ability to organize Party activists, all Party members, and the broad masses of workers to participate in the work. If we want to strengthen the supervision and inspection of work, we must improve all leadership methods.\n    Comrade Stalin taught us: \"If the inspection of work can be well organized, it will be like a searchlight, illuminating the work of a department at any time and anywhere, exposing the bureaucrats and formalists to their original form. It can be said with certainty that nine-tenths of the defects and loopholes in our work are due to the lack of well-organized work inspection. There is no doubt that if there is a correct work inspection, most of the defects and loopholes in the work can be avoided.\"\n    The responsibility of the party organization is to actively improve the inspection of the implementation of resolutions. And the resolutions themselves should indeed meet the requirements of the great tasks undertaken by the Soviet people. This is the premise for new victories in all aspects of our economic, cultural life, and the construction of the communist cause. (Chang Yanqing translated from the Soviet *Pravda*, April 17, 1948)\n　　　　　　　\n　　　　　(Xinhua News Agency)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 检查决议的执行程度是布尔塞维克领导的基本方法\n\n1948-07-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　检查决议的执行程度是布尔塞维克领导的基本方法\n    苏联真理报社论\n  　正确的政策是胜利的源泉，这是人所共知的。但是，这并不等于胜利的本身。胜利不是自己会来到的，必须加以组织，加以争取。\n    斯大林同志对于政策路线与组织工作的相互关系，作出了典型的定义。他说：“在制定正确的路线之后，对问题已作出正确的决议之后，事情的成败即决定于组织工作、人员的正确选择以及对各个领导机关执行程度的检查。否则，党的正确路线与决议即会遭受严重的损害。不仅如此，在制定正确的政策路线之后，组织工作即将决定一切，就是政策路线本身的命运——成功或失败——亦不例外。”\n    布尔塞维克政策之所以能获得连续的胜利，是因为党经常以全部力量进行组织工作，以保证自己政策路线之实现。我们的党正在进行着艰巨的工作——动员广大人民群众完成共产主义建设的历史任务。\n    列宁与斯大林教导我们：在组织工作中最主要的是选择干部与检查执行程度。党的组织只要遵循这一指示，就可以使布尔塞维克的领导方法在我国伟大建设的各方面都获得进益。\n    目前所进行的党的代表会议指出：党的组织为了提高战后时期的经济与文化，正在进行着热烈的与全面的工作，发挥苏维埃人民的伟大力量，他们的积极性与克服困难的坚定精神。党的组织在全国人民中发起社会主义竞赛，争取五年计划在四年内完成。在联共党中央对文学与艺术问题的决议颁布后，各地组织即更加注意于思想教育工作。许多党组织都积累了对群众宣传鼓动的丰富的经验。党的干部强固的掌握着布尔塞维克的领导艺术，提高自己的思想理论水平。\n    但是，许多次的代表会议也指出了党组织在领导工作方法上存在的严重的缺点。仍然有这样的工作人员，他们只注意于开会，准备决议与制成决议。而在决议一经制成之后，他们往往就会把这些决议忘得一干二净。制成的决议在实践中会怎样，所能实现的程度如何，是否所有的机构都已行动起来，遇到何种困难；需要采取何种补充措施以保证事情的顺利进行——对于所有这些都不给以应有的注意。例如，乞卡洛夫州的党代表会议指出：州党委与某些区党委减弱了对自己决议的执行程度的检查。州党委与区党委对于决议的执行只倚靠着自己小团体的活动，未能发动党的干部与苏维埃干部以及广大劳动群众积极参加工作。在万不得已时方派遣全权代表的办法，在这里已成为领导上的主要手段。日常的细密的群众工作、对干部的指导等时常是被无数决议的传达与电报的拍发取而代之。\n    这样的领导方法会造成一种错觉，即是：党委会如能制成大量的决议，向各地发出许多电报，就似乎能表明它在工作中确实有足够的紧张。但实际上，党的机关正是因为忙于这些工作而使自己不能广泛并全面的推动事情的进程。这样，也就不能充分发挥现有的提高全部工作的可能性。\n    布尔塞维克的领导原则要求：在制成决议之后即须计划并制定方策以保证这一决议的执行。在一种情形下，需要派出一个或一组有经验的工作人员至现地去。在另种情形下，则必须给以物资技术器材的援助。总而言之，组织决议的执行，这就是说要发动党与苏维埃的无数干部积极工作，由他们领导广大人民克服困难，保证以布尔塞维克的工作速度完成国家当前的任务。与干部们一起工作，给他们实际的帮助，指导他们，这是检查的主要方面。党委会的责任在于使工作人员们明白他们所执行的任务的实质，使他们了解用何种方法可以更好的执行决议，最好是选择何种组织形式方能增加党发动群众的力量，保证党组织当前任务的解决。\n    检查执行程度是党组织手段中最有效的武器。但必须严格遵守下述数点：\n    第一、对执行程度的检查必须是有系统的，而不是插曲式的。就是说，在制成决议之后，不迟疑，不等待，立即督促决议的执行。党委会必须了解该组织的日常生活，惟有如此，它才能随时随地过问并在必要时纠正工作。这样，对执行程度的检查方能随时发现工作中某一段落的混乱并及时找出造成混乱的责任者。只有随时并有系统的检查执行程度，方能预防错误和缺点，也只有如此，党委会方能适时的帮助自己的地方组织。检查执行程度乃是党组织以布尔塞维克责任心与纪律性教育干部的有力武器。\n    第二、检查执行程度不应该由次要的工作人员负责，而应该由领导人亲自动手。列宁曾要求各组织，各机关的领导人必须将自己领导下的有经验的，得力的工作人员“控制在自己手内，用以检查实际工作之进行”，委托“某某人，到那里去，视察，检查，如果事情出漏洞就要你负责”。斯大林同志曾指示过：领导人亲自检查工作是能够使工作检查发生效力的最重要条件之一。\n    第三、检查执行程度应该不只是根据形式的报告，而首先应在工作地点，根据工作的实际效果检查之。\n    第四、检查执行程度必须是客观的，严格的。惟有展开布尔塞维克的批评与自我批评方能及时揭露缺点并制定纠正缺点的方法。检查执行程度时对一切问题的解决不能舞弊徇私。哪里发展这种非布尔塞维克的风气，哪里就会产生不负责任的情形，跟踪而来的就是对国家利益的漠不关心与不忠实。对着缺点应该不是掩饰，要展开尖锐的布尔塞维克的批评，不是宽容，要用非常严格的态度对待它——这是使检查执行程度收效的一个重要条件。\n    检查执行程度是布尔塞维克领导的基本方法。检查执行程度的结果可以反映出党委会的全部领导作风，组织党的积极分子、全体共产党员、广大劳动群众参加工作的能力。如果要加强对工作的督促与检查，就必须改进全部的领导工作方法。\n    斯大林同志教导我们：“工作的检查如能组织良好，就会象探照灯似的，随时随地照明一个部门的工作情况，使官僚主义者与事务主义者暴露自己的原形。可以肯定的说：我们工作中十分之九的缺陷与漏洞都是由于缺乏组织良好的工作检查而来。无疑问的，如果有正确的工作检查，工作中的缺陷和漏洞大都可以避免的。”\n    党组织的责任是对于决议执行程度的检查工作加以积极的改进。而决议的本身则应确实符合苏维埃人民为执行其所担负的伟大任务的要求。这就是我国经济、文化生活与共产主义事业建设各方面的新的胜利的前提。（常彦卿译自一九四八年四月十七日苏联真理报）　　　　　　　\n　　　　　（新华社电）"

Some middle peasants, landlords, and rich peasants who had fled to other villages in the past have returned one after another. Juancheng launched a publicity campaign in early April, using markets, various gatherings, and individual conversations to explain policies. As of now, 900 people, including former puppet soldiers and fugitive households, have returned. After returning home, landlord Lü Qinxiu from Lü Miao made a self-criticism to the masses, saying that he should not have fled, and the Farmers' Association provided him with good resettlement. After landlord Li Mengtang from Lizhuang returned home, the masses also distributed land to him and resettled him. Yanjin is a marginal area in the southwest of the Fourth District. During the extensive re-examination movement last summer, it committed serious errors of left-leaning adventurism. Some landlords, rich peasants, and some middle peasants who did not understand the policies fled. Since the implementation of production and disaster relief in April, fugitive households have gradually recognized our Party's policies and have returned home one after another. Thirteen fugitive households have returned to Xichen Village in the county, and all have received appropriate compensation and resettlement, obtaining the same amount of land as the masses. Rich peasant Zhao Jian'san is a doctor. His pharmacy was confiscated during the land reform. After he returned, all the tools of the pharmacy were returned to him, and a sum of cash was loaned to him to help him purchase medicinal materials and open for business.\n\n(Another dispatch) After Taixi recovered large areas, it held mass meetings, puppet family meetings, and individual propaganda to explain our Party's land policy and lenient policy, dispelling the concerns of puppet families, who called on their husbands, sons, relatives, and friends to return home. After the head of Dayu Village, Fifth District, held a meeting, he called back 21 members of the security team. From May 30th to June 15th, in half a month, the entire county persuaded a total of 625 people to return, bringing with them six machine guns, 175 rifles, more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and four telephones.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鄄城延津深入宣传党的政策　逃亡户纷纷归来\n\n1948-07-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鄄城延津深入宣传党的政策\n  　逃亡户纷纷归来\n    【冀鲁豫讯】冀鲁豫各地两三个月以来，在实际工作中，做到了纠正左偏，端正政策，广泛宣传我党土地政策及生产政策，过去逃亡外乡的某些中农及地主富农纷纷归来。鄄城自四月初展开宣传运动，利用集市、各种集会和个别谈话等方式讲解政策，截至目前，已有伪军人员及逃亡户九百人归来。吕庙地主吕钦修回家后，向群众检讨过去不该外逃，农会很好的安置了他。李庄地主李梦堂回家后，群众也给他分了地，安置了他。延津为四分区西南部的边沿区，去夏大复查运动中，犯了严重的左倾冒险主义错误。有些地主富农和一部分不了解政策的中农逃亡了。自四月份进行生产救灾以来，逃亡户逐渐认识我党政策，陆续回家。该县西陈村逃亡户已回来十三户，均得到适当补偿和安置，获得和群众同样数量的土地。富农赵建三是个医生，土改中把他的药铺没收了，他回来后，药铺的一切工具都还了他，并贷给一部现款，帮助他置买药材开张营业。\n    【又讯】泰西收复大块地区后，召开群众会、伪属会及个别宣传，讲解我党土地政策及宽大政策，解除了伪属顾虑，纷纷叫丈夫、儿子、亲友回家。五区大虞村保长开罢会，就叫回保队人员二十一名。由五月三十日起、到六月十五日止，半月中全县共争取回来六百二十五人，带来机枪六挺，长短枪一百七十五支，子弹一万余发，电话机四部。"

    "content": "[News from Central Hebei] Comrade Tian Xiujuan, Director of the Women's Federation of Central Hebei, reported on women's work since the land reform movement at a meeting of women cadres from six counties and cities in the 8th, 9th, and 11th districts of Central Hebei on June 28th. She pointed out that since the land reform movement, women's work has achieved unprecedented depth and development due to the implementation of the Party's policy on women's work by Party committees at all levels and all comrades. The proportion of women who have been mobilized and organized (referring to women who have joined the farmers' association and youth league organizations) generally accounts for about 50% of the total number of women who should be mobilized (referring to poor peasants, farm laborers, middle peasants, and other laboring women who meet the conditions to join the farmers' association and youth league). In better villages, this reaches 80% of the total number of women in the village. According to statistics from 3,606 villages in 15 counties and cities in the 8th and 11th districts, there are 276,647 male members and 277,902 female members in the poor peasant leagues. Women account for more than 50% of the total membership. There are 482,940 male members and 453,588 female members in the new farmers' associations, with women accounting for more than 48% of the total membership. In Shen County, a total of 95,304 women have been mobilized, accounting for approximately 71% of the total number of women who should be mobilized. Through the tempering of struggle, a large number of female activists have been elected as cadres. According to statistics from 19 counties including Xian County, Ding County, and Shen County, there are 26,185 male representatives and 12,818 female representatives in the poor peasant leagues, with women accounting for slightly more than 32% of the total number of representatives. There are 25,582 male representatives and 9,811 female representatives in the new farmers' associations, with women accounting for 27% of the total number of representatives. Women's political awareness has greatly improved and has played a significant role in the military service movement. In six counties and 618 villages in the 11th district, there were 216 glorious mothers, glorious wives, and glorious sisters who sent their children and husbands to join the army. The broad masses of women have changed or are changing their old view that \"labor is a shame\" and are establishing a new view that labor is glorious. Especially since the land reform, women have been allocated a share of land, and their enthusiasm for production has increased even more. According to a survey in Nanbei Xusima, Raoyang, 60 households have women participating in major labor. In Xinji City and Gaoyang Chengguan, women rarely participated in labor in the past. Now, according to incomplete statistics, more than 5,000 women are participating in labor. After the democratic government's promotion and education, 80% of the women in Xinji City have gradually participated in various handicraft productions. Shi Ruixiang, a woman in Erjie, earns more than 200 jin of rice per month by reeling thread for a factory. Song Rui Duan supports a family of three by reeling thread. Li Dama's family of five completely relies on her to reel thread to maintain their livelihood. This year, women in various regions universally participated in the wheat harvest. In general villages in Lixian County, more than 50% of the women went to the fields to harvest wheat, while in Linbao, the figure was 70%. Women cadres themselves have also been tempered and improved in the land reform, and have made progress in their thinking and work style, and are more united than before. Comrade Tian further pointed out that it is necessary to further mobilize women to produce, and for women's production, specific slogans should be put forward based on the actual local conditions. For example, in the 9th and 11th districts, women already have the habit and foundation of field labor, and agricultural production technology should be improved. In areas with developed sideline industries (such as the Hejian shoe industry), it is necessary to propose strengthening product quality.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中妇女觉悟提高　积极参加农副业生产\n\n1948-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中妇女觉悟提高\n  　积极参加农副业生产\n    【冀中讯】冀中妇联会主任田秀娟同志在六月二十八日召开的冀中八、九、十一分区六个县市的妇女干部会议上，报告土改运动以来的妇女工作。指出：土改运动以来，由于各级党委和全体同志贯彻了全党作妇女工作的方针，使妇女工作得到了空前的深入和发展。已经发动和组织起来的妇女（指已参加农会及青年团组织的妇女），一般的占应发动妇女（指全村贫雇中农及其他够参加农会及青年团条件之劳动妇女）总数的百分之五十左右。较好的村则达到全村妇女总数的百分之八十。据八、十一分区十五个县市、三千六百零六个村的统计，贫农团男团员二十七万六千六百四十七人，女团员二十七万七千九百零二人。妇女占团员总数的百分之五十以上。新农会男会员四十八万二千九百四十人，女会员四十五万三千五百八十八人，妇女占会员总数百分之四十八以上。深县发动起来的妇女共九万五千三百零四人，约占应发动妇女总数百分之七十一。经过斗争的锻炼，大批妇女积极分子当选了干部；据献县、定县、深县等十九县的统计，贫农团男代表有二万六千一百八十五人，女代表有一万二千八百一十八人，妇女占代表总数的百分之三十二强。新农会男代表二万五千五百八十二人，女代表九千八百一十一人，妇女占代表总数百分之二十七。妇女们的政治觉悟大大提高，在参军运动中起了很大作用。十一分区六个县、六百一十八个村庄，出现了送自己子弟丈夫参军的光荣娘、光荣妻、光荣姐妹等二百一十六人。广大妇女在思想上转变了或正在转变着“劳动为耻辱”的旧观点树立着劳动光荣的新观点，特别自土改以后，妇女分得了一份土地，生产情绪更加高涨。据饶阳南北许司马的调查，有六十户妇女参加主要劳动。辛集市、高阳城关过去妇女很少参加劳动，现在据不完全统计，参加劳动的妇女达五千余人。辛集市经过民主政府的提倡教育，百分之八十的妇女逐渐参加了各种手工业生产。二街妇女石瑞祥给工厂打线，每月赚米二百多斤。宋瑞端靠打线养活了三口人。李大妈全家五口，完全依靠她打线维持生活。今年各地妇女普遍参加麦收，蠡县一般村百分之五十以上的妇女下地收麦。林堡间占百分之七十。妇女干部本身在土改中，也得到了锻炼和提高，在思想作风上前进了一步，比以前团结得多了。田同志继指出：今后要进一步发动妇女生产，而对于妇女生产，要根据当地实际情况，提出具体口号，如在九、十一分区，妇女已有田间劳动的习惯和基础，应提高农业生产技术；在副业发达的地区（如河间鞋业）应提出加强产品质量。"

In Jingxing's eight districts, 2,151 women participated in wheat harvesting, sowing, and weeding. Zhao Su'e from Dongfangling, who is eighteen years old, is as capable as men in harvesting wheat and weeding; Zhang Rongni from Touquan Village did not have livestock, so she and Zhao Lianni exchanged labor, with the men plowing the land and the two of them sowing seeds, planting seven or eight mu in one morning. Ma Yu'ai and Liang Chou'ni, women from Wujiazhuang, each led a mutual aid team; Chou'ni's team had ten people, and they threshed five fields of wheat in one afternoon. Influenced by them, 103 women participated in mutual aid production. In Jianping's fifth district, more than 500 women from 36 villages made 1,300 pairs of shoes for the public, earning 28,600 chi of cloth in wages. They happily said, \"This solves the clothing problem.\" More than 50 women in Jiajiakou, Quyang, sewed soles for a shoe factory, earning more than 14 million border currency in half a year. In Beigaoying Village, Zhengding, most of the men went out to work as boatmen, and the women took charge of watering the gardens and pulling water carts at home. Women were responsible for nearly half of the village's agricultural production. The family members of laborers going to the front and military dependents were also actively engaged in production. Wu Yulian, a female party member from Beiliangdu, Jingxing, organized seven military dependents to help each other in production, weeding two mu of sorghum in half an afternoon. As a result of women's active participation in production, family relationships were harmonized, and their social status was also improved. Liang Chou'ni's mother-in-law said, \"My Chou'ni works really hard in the fields; our family relies entirely on her.\" Therefore, the mother-in-law cooks breakfast every morning to let Chou'ni rest. Wu Deshan, who is about sixty years old from Wujiazhuang, said, \"In the past, we only said that women could not do anything, but now that they have added their efforts to the fields, we don't have to worry about not having enough to eat!\" Many people said, \"No wonder the government said it would improve the status of women; they are indeed doing it!\"\n　　　　　(Lǐ Yīxīn, Zhāng Zhìpíng, Xù, Dù Yùjīn, Zhào Jǐngfú, Lǐ Chūnfú)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳四分区妇女积极生产　社会地位提高家庭关系和睦\n\n1948-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳四分区妇女积极生产\n  　社会地位提高家庭关系和睦\n    【北岳讯】四分区许多县份的妇女积极参加生产，和睦了家庭，提高了自己的社会地位。井陉八个区，有两千一百五十一个妇女参加麦收、下种、锄苗。东方岭十八岁的赵素娥，割麦、锄苗都能顶上男子；头泉村张荣妮没有牲口，她和赵连妮变工，男人耕地，她们两个下种，一上午种了七八亩。武家庄妇女马玉爱、梁丑妮，每人领导一个互助组，丑妮组十个人，一后晌打了五场麦。在她们影响下，有一百零三个妇女参加了互助生产。建屏五区三十六个村有五百多个妇女给公家做鞋一千三百双，得工资布二万八千六百尺，她们高兴的说：“这可解决了穿衣问题。”曲阳贾家口五十多个妇女给鞋厂纳鞋底，半年共得边币一千四百多万元。正定北高营村男人大部外出撑船生产，妇女们在家浇园、拉水车，全村农业生产近一半由妇女担负。出征民工家属和军属妇女，同样积极生产，井陉北良都女党员吴玉莲，串通七个军属互助生产，半个后晌锄了二亩高粱。妇女们积极生产的结果，家庭关系和睦了，自己的社会地位也提高了。梁丑妮的婆婆说：“俺丑妮上地真苦啦，俺家全凭她哩”。婆婆因此每天早上做饭，叫丑妮休息。武家庄六十来岁的武德山说：“以前咱只说娘儿们能干个啥，现在地里添上她们这把手，还愁没吃的吗？”许多人说：“怪不得政府说要提高妇女，人家果然是行！”\n    　　　　　（李一新、张治平、续、杜玉金、赵景福、李春福）"

    "content": "South Hebei Solves Mass Production Difficulties\n  　Establishing In-Kind Credit Cooperative\n    [Our Newspaper] The Nanhe Village, the Ninth District of Wu'an, began a pilot in-kind credit cooperative last winter. Based on the principle of depositing and lending actual goods and benefiting both depositors and borrowers, it aimed to solve the difficulties faced by the masses in production capital and help mass production. In the past six months, 66 households have deposited goods, totaling 7,197 catties of grain and 53 catties of cotton. Forty-nine households borrowed goods, circulating a total of 13,085 catties of miscellaneous grains. The credit cooperative earned a total of 703 catties in dividends within six months. In the first three months, the borrowing households used the borrowed grain and cotton for production, earning an average net profit of 45,000 yuan per household. In the latter three months, mass sideline production was slightly affected due to land redistribution and the arrival of the wheat harvest. According to complete statistics from three households, they borrowed a total of 950 catties of millet for transportation, earning a net profit of 210,000 yuan.\n    The in-kind credit cooperative was initiated and organized last winter by Comrade Zhang Xigui and Wu Dongsheng, the director of the village cooperative. At that time, commodity prices fluctuated, and the masses who had grain dared not easily use it for production, turning the grain into dead assets. Some people wanted to engage in transportation but lacked capital and had no place to borrow, which was very difficult. In response to this situation, Comrades Zhang and Wu decided to pilot an in-kind credit cooperative that would benefit both depositors and borrowers.\n    In order to facilitate borrowing for the masses, the in-kind credit cooperative stipulated extremely flexible deposit and loan methods: Regardless of depositing or borrowing grain, there were no time limits or quantity restrictions. Depositors received dividends on a regular basis, and borrowers paid a monthly interest of three catties per hundred catties (two and a half catties for shoulder-pole traders). Depositors could deposit more if they had more, less if they had less, deposit whenever they had it, and withdraw whenever they needed it, which not only avoided waste and damage but also increased profits, and dividends were distributed regularly. Borrowers could borrow more if they needed more, less if they needed less, borrow whenever they needed it, and repay whenever they had it. The in-kind credit cooperative lent, sold, bought, and transported actual goods, which not only solved the difficulty of borrowing for the masses but also obtained appropriate profits, benefiting depositors. Over the past six months, depositors have profited and borrowers have earned money in the cooperative, which has won the support of the entire village. For example, Liu Da'wu, a poor peasant in the village, had no grain at home last winter, and his family was starving. Later, he borrowed 200 catties of millet. After half a year of transportation, he solved the livelihood of his family of six. After clearing his account this time, he still had more than 50,000 yuan left. After the wheat harvest, the masses are brewing plans to invest a large amount of wheat that they cannot eat for the time being. Director Zhang Xigui said confidently: \"In the great production movement, we must make the credit cooperative even better.\" (Shang Kai)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南河底解决群众生产困难　创办实物信用合作社\n商恺\n1948-07-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　南河底解决群众生产困难\n  　创办实物信用合作社\n    【本报讯】武安九区南河底村于去冬开始试办实物信用社，根据存实物贷实物、存贷两利的原则，解决群众生产资本的困难，帮助群众生产。半年来，存物者有六十六户，共存粮七千一百九十七斤，存棉五十三斤。贷物者四十九户，共周转杂粮一万三千八十五斤。信用社在六个月内共得红利七百零三斤，贷户前三个月用所贷粮棉投入生产，平均每户净赚四万五千元。后三个月因抽补土地与进入麦收，群众副业生产稍受影响。根据三户完整统计，共贷小米九百五十斤搞运输，净赚二十一万元。\n    实物信用社在去冬由该村合作社长张西贵、吴东生二同志发起组织。当时物价涨落不定，群众有存粮者不敢轻易动用经营生产，把粮食变为死物。有人想搞运输却缺少资本，无处借贷，非常困难。根据这一情况，张、吴两同志便决定试办有利于存、贷双方的实物信用社。\n    为了群众借贷方便，实物信用社规定了极灵活的存贷办法：不管存粮、贷粮，时间不限，数目不拘，存粮者按期分红，贷粮者每百斤出月利三斤（肩挑贸易者二斤半），存粮者，有多存多，有少存少，随有随存，随用随抽，既可避免浪费损坏，又能增加利润，按期分红。贷粮者，用多贷多，用少贷少，随用随贷，随有随还。实物信用社贷实物、卖实物、买实物、运实物，既解决了群众借贷的困难，又能获得适当利润，有利于存户。六个月来，在该社存粮者得利，贷粮者赚钱，已经获得全村群众的拥护。如该村贫农刘大吴，去冬家中无粮，全家断炊，后来贷了二百斤小米，经过半年的运输经营，已经解决了全家六口人的生活，这次结帐本利还清后，尚余五万多元。麦收后群众纷纷酝酿，把暂时吃不着的麦子大量入股。社长张西贵很有信心的说：“在大生产运动中，一定把信用社搞得更好。”（商恺）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 19th: Following the news of the \"July 5th\" tragedy in Beiping, students in Harbin were filled with grief and indignation at the Chiang Kai-shek-Fu Zuoyi bandit gang's massacre of their fellow students from the Northeast. The city's Student Union and the Mao Zedong Youth League jointly held a city-wide youth student meeting on the 13th to denounce the Chiang bandits' crimes of slaughtering students from the Northeast. More than 8,000 students from six middle schools in Harbin, as well as Worker's Middle School, Northeast Academy of Sciences, Xingzhi Normal School, Youth Cadre School, Finance and Economics Cadre School, and Postal and Telecommunications School, as well as young workers and staff from various factories, attended the meeting.范桂奇, a student representative from Harbin No. 1 Middle School and chairman of the meeting, reported on the events of the \"July 5th\" incident, and then proposed that all students in Harbin should intensify their work and study, vowing to avenge the students who died in the \"July 5th\" tragedy. The meeting then invited Mayor Zhu Qiwen to speak. He emphasized that the disasters suffered by the people of the Northeast for the past 20 years were inseparable from Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek had always treated the people of the Northeast as \"uncivilized people,\" discriminating against, excluding, selling out, and even slaughtering them. The history of 20 years proves that as long as Chiang Kai-shek's rule exists, there will be no democratic, free, and happy life for young people. This time, thousands of students from the Northeast, deceived and coerced by Chiang Kai-shek, traveled from Changchun and Jilin to Shenyang, from Shenyang to Beiping, wandering around and being persecuted everywhere, and finally suffering massacre. This is a loss for the people of the Northeast, and the youth of the Northeast should avenge them and demand blood debts from Chiang Kai-shek. The liberated areas of the Northeast welcome students from the Chiang-controlled areas to come to the liberated areas to study and work, and jointly overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and build a new Northeast. After Mayor Zhu's speech, Chen Guangrui and Liu Guozeng, students who had just escaped from the Chiang-controlled areas to Harbin and are now studying at the Northeast Academy of Sciences and the Youth Cadre School, reported on their personal experiences of being deceived and persecuted by the Northeast Chiang government authorities against young students, arousing uncontrollable anger among the students at the meeting. Slogans such as \"Fight to Nanjing! Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!\" and \"Down with Chiang Kai-shek! Establish a New China!\" resounded for a long time. The meeting finally sent a telegram to youth and students across the country, declaring: \"The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has made the people of the Northeast suffer 14 years of colonial life, and now it is colluding with U.S. imperialism, using American bullets to massacre students from the Northeast. We must resolutely rise up and fight the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to the end. The fresh blood of the 'July 5th' tragedy cannot be shed in vain, and this blood debt must be repaid by the executioners Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi. We, the students in the liberated areas of the Northeast, vow to take practical actions to resolutely support your struggle against persecution until the final victory is achieved.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 17th: People from all walks of life in Harbin have launched a movement against U.S. imperialism's support for Japan. On the morning of the 9th, representatives from 106 industries in Harbin's business community held a special current affairs forum in the auditorium of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to discuss the issue of U.S. imperialism supporting Japan. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely激昂 (激昂: impassioned/aroused). Liu Peizhi, chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: \"Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance caused the people of the Northeast to suffer 14 years of national subjugation. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is again colluding with U.S. imperialism to support Japan's resurgence, attempting to plunge the people of the Northeast and China into a deep abyss of suffering again. We vow to oppose it to the death.\" Wang Ming, manager of Taihe Company, said: \"We cannot forget the bloody facts of the Japanese invaders' massacre of the people of the Northeast after the September 18th Incident. It has been less than three years since Chairman Mao led us to defeat the Japanese invaders, and now the U.S. and Chiang are supporting Japan's armed resurgence. The Chinese people will never tolerate it.\" Wu Baizhen, a giant in Harbin's business community, said: \"Today, under the leadership of the democratic government, we must improve the quality of our products to resist the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism.\" The meeting also passed a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters in the liberated areas across the country to express their respect. Large and small schools throughout the city, the Harbin Mao Zedong Youth League, and factory workers also held meetings around the \"July 7th\" anniversary to oppose the U.S. plot to support Japan's resurgence. More than 50 primary schools in Harbin sent a telegram to children across the country on the \"July 7th\" memorial day, saying: \"We must not, after defeating the evil Japanese imperialism and the puppet Puyi, endure all the oppression and insults imposed on the children of our new China by the U.S. and Chiang. We firmly believe that the power of the people will surely defeat any reactionaries and establish an independent, free, and happy new China under the leadership of the Communist Party!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哈市学生集会　声讨蒋匪屠杀学生　各界掀起反对美帝扶日运动\n\n1948-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哈市学生集会\n  　声讨蒋匪屠杀学生\n  　各界掀起反对美帝扶日运动\n    【新华社东北十九日电】北平“七、五”惨案消息传来后，哈尔滨全市大中学生对蒋傅匪帮屠杀东北同学的暴行无不悲愤填胸。该市学联与毛泽东青年团于十三日联合召开全市青年学生大会，声讨蒋匪屠杀东北学生罪行。到会有哈市六个中学及工人中学、东北科学院、行知师范、青年干部学校、财经干部学校、邮电学校等校学生及各工厂青年工人职员等共八千余人。大会主席哈市第一中学学生代表范桂奇报告“七、五”事件经过后，提出全哈学生应加紧工作、学习，誓为“七、五”死难同学复仇。大会继邀请朱其文市长讲话。他着重指出：二十年来东北人民的灾难与蒋介石是分不开的。蒋介石一贯对待东北人民如“化外之民”，歧视、排斥、出卖以至屠杀。二十年的历史证明：有蒋介石统治存在，就不会有青年的民主、自由、幸福的生活。此次数千东北学生在蒋介石欺骗胁迫下，由长吉而沈阳，由沈阳而北平，辗转流离，到处受迫害，最后竟遭受残杀。这是东北人民的损失，东北青年应为他们复仇，向蒋介石讨还血债。东北解放区欢迎蒋区同学来解放区学习和工作，共同打倒蒋介石，建设新东北。朱市长讲话后，继由新自蒋区逃来哈市，现在东北科学院与青年干部学校学习的陈光瑞、刘国增等同学报告，他们痛诉亲身遭受东北蒋政府当局对青年学生欺骗、迫害的实际情况，引起会场学生不可遏止的愤怒，“打到南京去！活捉蒋介石！”“打倒蒋介石！建立新中国！”的口号声经久不息。大会最后通电全国青年学生，宣称：“蒋介石匪帮曾使东北同胞遭受了十四年的殖民地生活，现在又勾结美帝国主义，以美国子弹屠杀东北学生。我们要坚决起来，和蒋介石匪帮抗争到底。“七、五”惨案的鲜血不能白流，这血债一定要刽子手蒋介石、傅作义来偿还。我们东北解放区的同学，誓以实际行动，坚决支持你们的反迫害斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。”\n    【新华社东北十七日电】哈市各界人民展开反对美帝扶日运动。九日上午哈尔滨市工商界一百零六个行业代表假工商联合会礼堂特举行时事座谈会，座谈美帝扶日问题，会场空气极为激昂。工商联合会主任委员刘佩芝说：“蒋介石的不抵抗政策，使东北同胞遭受十四年亡国的痛苦。今天蒋介石又和美帝国主义扶日再起，企图再陷东北及中国人民于痛苦深渊。我们誓死反对。”泰和公司经理王鸣说：“九一八以后日寇残杀东北同胞血迹斑斑的事实，我们不能忘掉。毛主席领导我们战胜日寇还不到三年，现在美蒋又扶植日本武装再起。中国人民决不能容忍。”哈市工商界巨子武百祯说：“今天我们在民主政府领导下，我们要提高生产品质，对抗美帝国主义的经济侵略。”会议并通过致电毛主席朱总司令及全国各解放区指战员致敬。全市大中小学、哈市毛泽东青年团及工厂工友等亦均于“七七”前后，纷纷举行集会，反对美扶日再起的阴谋。哈市五十余小学校在“七七”纪念日通电全国儿童说：“我们决不能在打倒万恶的日本帝国主义和傀儡溥仪之后，又忍受美蒋给我们新中国儿童一切的压迫与侮辱。我们坚信人民的力量一定能打垮任何反动派，在共产党领导下建立独立自由幸福的新中国！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 12th: In various parts of Northeast China, rural branches and members of the Chinese Communist Party are using their exemplary actions and leading roles to ensure the successful completion of spring plowing and actively carry out summer hoeing. In Jining County, Mudanjiang Province, under the leadership of Party members, in addition to planting more than 43,000 hectares of cultivated land, more than 5,400 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed, expanding the cultivated area by 12 percent. In the eighth district of Longjiang County, Nenjiang Province, a large number of production activists emerged during the spring plowing. The Party branch absorbed them into the Party and, through them, united and led the masses in production, thus completing the planting of all 25,000 hectares of land in the district and reclaiming nearly 600 hectares of wasteland. Currently, more than 18,000 hectares have been weeded. At the beginning of the spring plowing, the Party branch of the first administrative village in the district convened a branch meeting and passed a resolution for Party members to widely mobilize production. Party members divided their work, each uniting more than ten households of people, collecting opinions, concentrating on research, and caring for the masses in every way, solving difficulties for them. For example, when planting large fields, the village lacked corn seeds, so Party member Guan Suohuan raised funds and personally went to a distant place to buy seeds, and did not ask everyone to repay the labor even though he missed work, solving the planting difficulties of 40 hectares of land. Ten loafers in the whole village who did not work have gradually changed under the education and help of Party members. When the fourth district of Nenjiang County proposed mobilizing women to go to the fields, female Party members in each branch set an example and took the lead in demonstrating. In Hejiang Province, the slogan \"One Party member leads a production team well\" received an enthusiastic response from all over the province.

In Rongcheng, Xie Kou Island and other seven villages, there were originally 80 salt flats, and now 12 new ones have been added. The monthly salt production reached 76,772 dan, exceeding the total output of last year by 26.17 percent.

    "content": "[Chahar News] Organizing the masses to engage in production based on local specific conditions and starting from the needs of the masses will win the support of the masses, and one's own business can gradually develop. Conversely, it will certainly cause dissatisfaction and opposition from the masses. The two cooperatives in Ma'an Village, Fangshan, most clearly prove this principle. Ma'an Village is the most scattered village in the Second District, consisting of six natural villages. There are two cooperatives in the village: Wolonghu and Ma'an Village. When the Wolonghu Cooperative was established last year, it faced many difficulties. It had no capital, no houses, and no furniture, and the confidence of cadres and the masses was not high. After slow research, it was decided that without capital, the masses could be absorbed to invest in kind, such as peppercorns, persimmons, chicken eggs, etc. All physical objects would be converted at market prices, ensuring that the common people would not suffer losses; if they could not build houses, they would call on everyone to invest in labor shares, with each work day calculated as 10,000 yuan (border currency, same below) in shares; the poorest households who had nothing could also cut mountain grass for covering persimmons and convert it into shares. Using these methods, the Wolonghu Cooperative began to be established. At that time, there were a total of 72 members, with 127 shares (each share worth 50,000 yuan). At this time, the shares were all in kind and labor, with no cash at all, making it difficult to operate. In order to support them, the state-owned store invested 4 million yuan in the cooperative. In addition, the government-issued loan of 2 million yuan was also placed in the cooperative as shares (it is not clear what kind of loan this 2 million yuan was, or to whom it was lent. If it was lent to the masses, it would be inappropriate to put it all in the cooperative. It should be lent to households in difficulty, allowing them to dispose of it freely, either to invest in shares or to engage in other production—Editor), totaling 6 million yuan. With money, business started. At first, the method of bartering was adopted, exchanging the peppercorns, persimmons, walnuts, cashmere, and wool invested by the masses for coal and jujube branches, and then transporting the coal and jujube branches out of the mountains to exchange for the daily necessities needed by the masses. After earning money, they went to Yi County to buy some cloth and daily necessities, and called on the masses to dig up medicinal materials for exchange, and the prices of these daily necessities were set cheaper than in other places. The collected Bupleurum, Platycodon, Polygala, Saposhnikovia and other medicinal materials were uniformly handed over to the store for consignment sales. From October last year to May this year, a total profit of 10,051,600 yuan was obtained. The cooperative not only supplied the daily necessities of the masses, but more importantly, it drove the production of the masses and solved most of the famine problems. This spring, the income from jujube branches and Bupleurum alone was 25,650,000 yuan, enabling the masses to buy about 90 dan of corn. Gong Defu and Gong Fulin, poor peasants in Dachunhu, could not even afford cotton clothes every winter. After the establishment of this cooperative, they seized every opportunity, getting up early and going to bed late to dig up medicinal materials. Not only did they wear cotton clothes last year, but also solved all the problems of summer clothes this year. Jin Guoquan had no money to invest in shares. When the cooperative built houses, he invested ten work days in labor shares, worth 50,000 ocean, and another 150,000 yuan in persimmons, totaling 200,000 yuan. When dividends were distributed at the end of March, he received a total of 210,000 yuan and bought one dan of corn. He planned to add some wheat of his own and dig up some medicinal materials to solve the living problems of his family of six for two months. Xin Derong, a military dependent, under the promotion of the cooperative, chopped more than 100 catties of firewood every day, and also dug up medicinal materials and weaved baskets for carrying when herding sheep, and automatically declined preferential treatment. Because this cooperative helped everyone solve their living problems, the masses supported it very much. The masses in Dongxi Taiping, Ma'an and Luzishui, Tang'er Shang, Bao'er Shui, Yihe Village, Wuhe Village and other places in the First District all came to this cooperative to buy things, and many masses who had not invested in shares in the past came to invest in shares. There are three main reasons why this cooperative can win the support of the masses: (1) It can organize the masses to engage in production according to actual conditions, solve the difficulties of the masses, and help the masses overcome the famine. (2) The leadership fully promoted democracy, and everyone studied how to conduct business. Since October last year, four shareholders' meetings have been held, and non-shareholding masses have been invited to participate and listen to their opinions. What business should be carried out in each season, and the prices of goods, are all decided at the shareholders' meeting. (3) Dividends are distributed in a timely manner to dispel the ideological concerns of the masses. From October last year to March this year, many people went to the cooperative to borrow salt and cloth. Some people were not sure whether the cooperative would make money, and they doubted the cooperative, asking to withdraw their shares, and some asked to withdraw their shares to pay off debts. At this time, the cooperative promptly settled the accounts and distributed dividends, with each 10,000 yuan earning a dividend of 10,500 yuan. The concerns of the masses were dispelled. Some used the dividends to pay off their debts, and some reinvested the principal and interest. The masses all said that this cooperative is \"a cooperative that truly does good things for the people!\"\n\nThe cooperative in Ma'an Village was set up to cope with the higher authorities by forcibly collecting 5.6 million yuan in physical shares. In addition to selling some cloth, mats, wine, cigarettes and other things, there was no other business. When the accounts were settled this year, 7,000 yuan was also earned for every 10,000 yuan, but the cooperative was afraid that the masses would freely dispose of the dividends, so it ordered that no dividends should be withdrawn. In the spring, the masses were very difficult and needed money most, but they could not withdraw money from the cooperative. The cooperative did not care about the living problems of the masses, nor did it try to organize the masses to engage in production. There are four non-working cadres working in the cooperative, and the masses feel that they can't do much work, and they don't go to work, and they are very dissatisfied that they are divided into three shares when they make money. Many masses asked to withdraw their shares and disband this cooperative.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 根据群众需要组织群众生产　卧龙湖合作社受到群众拥护　大家自愿入股劳力实物都行　民主讨论营业及时分批红利\n\n1948-07-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　根据群众需要组织群众生产\n  　卧龙湖合作社受到群众拥护\n  　大家自愿入股劳力实物都行\n  　民主讨论营业及时分批红利\n    【察哈尔讯】根据当地具体情况，从群众需要出发，组织群众进行生产，就能获得群众拥护，自己的业务也可逐步发展。反之一定引起群众的不满和反对。房山马安村的两个合作社，最明显的证实了这一原则。马安村是二区最分散的一个村庄，由六个自然村组成。村里有卧龙湖马安村两个合作社。去年卧龙湖合作社成立时困难挺多。既没股本又没房屋更没家具，干部群众的信心也不高。经过慢慢的研究，决定没有本钱可以吸收群众以实物如花椒、柿子、鸡子等入股，所有实物统按市价折算，一定不叫老百姓吃了亏；盖不起房则号召大家入劳力股，每个工算一万元（边币、下同）股金，没有劳动力的入些木料也折成股金；个别最穷的户什么也没有，也可割盖柿子用的山草折成股金。用了这些办法，卧龙湖合作社开始成立起来。当时共有社员七十二人，股金一百二十七股（每股合五万元）。这时的股金都是些实物和劳力，没有一个现钱，倒腾不开。公营商店为了扶植他们，向该社投资四百万元。另外还把政府发给的贷款二百万元也放在社里作了股金（这二百万元是什么贷款，贷给谁的，都未说清楚。如系贷给群众的，一律放在合作社就不妥当。应该贷给困难户，由他们自由处理，或入股，或搞其他生产——编者），共达六百万元。有了钱，生意就作开了。开始采用了以货换货的办法，把群众入股的花椒、柿子、核桃、羊绒、羊毛等物换成煤和荆条再把煤和荆条运到山外，换回群众日常必需的物品。赚了钱，又到易县买了一部分布和日用品，号召群众刨药材来掉换，这些日用必需品的价钱都比其他地方定得便宜些。收来的柴胡、桔梗、远志、防风等药材，则统一交商店代销。从去年十月到今年五月，共获利一千○五十一万六千元。合作社不仅供给了群众的日用品，更重要的是带动了群众的生产，解决了大部灾荒问题。今年春天仅条子、柴胡两项，就收了二千五百六十五万元，使群众能买玉米九十大石左右。大春湖贫农宫德甫、宫甫林，每年冬天连棉衣都穿不上，这个合作社成立以后，他们就抓紧一切空隙，起早睡晚的刨药材，不但去年穿上了棉衣，今年的夏服也全解决了。晋国全没钱入股，合作社盖房时入了十个工的劳力股，合洋五万元，另外又入了十五万元的柿子，共凑成二十万元。到三月底分红时，共分得了二十一万元，买了一石玉米，他计划再加上自己的一点小麦和刨些药材，全家六口人两个月的生活问题就解决了。军属辛德荣，在合作社推动下，每天打柴一百多斤，放羊时还刨药材编笼驮，自动谢绝了优待工。因为这个合作社帮助大家解决了生活问题，所以群众对他非常拥护。东西太平、马安和一区芦子水、堂儿上、宝儿水、义合村、五合村等地群众，都到这个合作社来购买东西，许多过去没有入股的群众都纷纷来入股了。这个合作社所以能得到群众的拥护，主要有三个原因：（一）能根据实际情况，组织群众生产，解除群众困难，帮助群众渡过了灾荒。（二）领导上充分的发扬了民主，由大家来研究如何进行营业。从去年十月以来，曾开过四次股东大会，并邀请没有入股的群众参加，听取他们的意见。每一季节应该进行什么业务，以及货物的价格，全是股东大会上讨论决定的。（三）及时分红，解除群众思想顾虑。去年十月到今年三月，群众到合作社赊盐赊布的很多，有的群众摸不清合作社是否会赚钱，对合作社发生了怀疑，要求退股，有的要求抽出股本来还帐。这时合作社及时的算了帐，发了红利，每一万元分得红利一万零五百元，群众的顾虑打破了，有的用红利还了帐，有的连本带利又入了股。群众都说这个合作社是“真正给人民办好事的合作社！”\n    马安村的合作社是为了应付上级，硬凑了五百六十万元实物股金办起来的。除了卖些布、席、酒、烟等物外，别的营业什么也没有。今年算帐时一万元也赚了七千元，但合作社怕群众自由处理了红利，就下命令一律不许抽红利。春天群众非常困难，最需要钱，眼看着合作社里有钱抽不出来。合作社对于群众的生活问题并不关心，也不设法组织群众进行生产。该社共有四个免勤干部在里面工作，群众觉得他们干不了多少事，又不出勤务，赚了钱还按三股分，非常不满，许多群众要求抽股，解散这个合作社。"

    "content": "Check Mutual Aid, Promote Good Experiences\n  　Production at the Baojiajiao Base Point Gains Momentum\n    [Taihang News] Recently, the Baojiajiao base point in the Second District of Licheng checked the mutual aid in various villages, promoted good practices, corrected bad practices, and made progress in mutual aid production. In the past, Gao Bancao's group in this village only looked at the size of people when assigning work points, and did not consider the quality of work, which was very unfair. Some people worked quickly and well, while others did not work well, but both received ten work points per day, which dissatisfied the skilled workers. Two oxen plowing land for one day were calculated as three mu, earning 12.5 jin of fodder and 72 jin of grass, with labor costs separate; but two good donkeys delivering manure for one day could only earn 8.12 jin of rice, also without grass (and labor costs separate). The mutual aid group determined that oxen should only plow the land and donkeys should only deliver manure. Generally, donkeys were stronger than oxen in this village, so the households raising donkeys were very dissatisfied. Liu Qingren's group's method was the opposite: labor points were assigned according to the quality and speed of work each day, with good and fast workers receiving more points, and bad and slow workers receiving fewer points; livestock points were assigned with oxen plowing land earning 15 points per day, and delivering manure earning 12 points (because oxen were more suitable for plowing land), and donkeys earning 15 points per day for both plowing and delivering manure (because donkeys did both well), and points were assigned flexibly according to the quality and speed of the livestock. In this way, the whole group was satisfied and production was very energetic. After inspection, Baojiajiao village found that there were three problems hindering mutual aid: first, the work accounts from the previous two years had not been settled; second, good and bad laborers were all assigned ten points per day; and third, there were conflicts among cadres: in one group, there were four main cadres, including the branch secretary, village head, militia committee director, and instructor, as well as a former farmers' association chairman, who not only did not actively lead and promote the group, but often caused friction, which affected the entire group and made it worse and worse. The problem in Yushuping village was that they only made calls to action but did not inspect: some time ago, when they called for sowing, a man named Xing Tianxi planted millet without plowing the land because he was afraid of paying the mutual aid equivalent of rice. The cadres did not inspect and praised him greatly that night, saying that he responded to the call and sowed early, and was active in production. The masses were very dissatisfied when they heard this, saying, \"The higher-ups called for deep plowing and careful cultivation, but he didn't even plow the land. If that's the case, we can plow earlier than him.\" Therefore, even criticism and praise had no effect in this village. Songjiazhuang, Hong＠he and other villages only made calls to action but did not make plans and produced blindly; Yan'jing village did not praise good examples or summarize and promote good methods, causing production to fall into spontaneous flow. After the inspection, everyone discussed and decided to use good examples and good methods to promote everyone, and each cadre should lead a good group in production, make short-term plans regularly, check on time, praise achievements in time, and summarize and promote good experiences. Baojiajiao village promoted Liu Qingren's group's method of assigning points according to work, and changed to assigning work flexibly according to fixed points, which quickly improved production enthusiasm. It was originally planned to weed the corn in eight days (each person weeding six points per day), but it was completed in seven days. Wang Jinfa's group originally planned to complete seedling pulling in five days, but because they absorbed three children and five women, and started early and ate breakfast in the fields, each laborer pulled an average of one more point per day, and it was completed in four days. The auxiliary labor of Gao Bancao's group was also paid according to the work, and some women did not rest at noon to prepare dinner in order to do more work. Men went to the fields early in the morning, and women prepared meals and brought them to the fields, so that each person did an average of two more work points per day. The village also paid attention to cultivating women and children: when going to the fields, they first showed them how to do it, let them learn, and then checked after they were done, pointed out the shortcomings, and corrected them immediately. The whole village absorbed twenty-seven women and twenty-two children to participate in seedling pulling, and the women were able to do the same amount of work as full laborers, saving a lot of male labor. Wang Jinfa's group has already extracted two people to open an oil mill, preparing to topdress the corn of the whole group.\n    　　　　　　　　　(Jin Song, San Suo, Fuxing)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 检查互助发扬好经验　暴家脚基点生产有了劲\n金松　三锁　富兴\n1948-07-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　检查互助发扬好经验\n  　暴家脚基点生产有了劲\n    【太行讯】黎城二区暴家脚基点最近检查各村互助，发扬好的做法，改正坏的做法，互助生产有了进步。该村高半曹组以前订分光看人的个子大小，不看做活好坏，订的很不公道。有些人做活又快又好，有些人做得很不好，都是每天十分工，好把式都不满意。两头牛耕一天地，按三亩计算，可赚料十二斤半，赚草七十二斤，人工在外；但两头好驴送一天粪只能赚八斤十二两米，还不管草（人工也在外）。互助组确定牛驴分工：牛光耕地，驴光送粪。该村一般是驴比牛强，所以喂驴户很不满意。刘清任组的办法和这些相反：劳力订分，是按每天做活好坏快慢来订，好的快的多订，坏的慢的少订；牲口订分，牛耕地一天十五分，送粪十二分（因牛适于耕地），驴耕地送粪每天都是十五分（因驴两样都干得好），并按牲口好坏快慢死分活计。这样全组都满意，生产很有劲。暴家脚村经过检查，发现有三种问题障碍互助：一是前二年工帐没算清，二是好坏劳力每天一律订十分，三是干部闹矛盾：有一个组里就有支书、村长、武委会主任、指导员等四个主要干部，和一个旧农会主席，在组里不仅不积极领导推动，反而时常闹磨擦，影响整个组越闹越坏。榆树坪村生产上的毛病是光号召，不检查：前些时号召下种，有一个叫邢天喜的，因怕出互助等价米，没耕地就把谷子硬种上了。干部没检查，当晚就大大表扬一顿，说他响应号召，提前下种，生产积极。群众听到非常不满，说“上级叫深耕细作，他连耕也不耕，要这样，咱比他耕能早。”因此该村连批评表扬都不起作用。宋家庄、洪＠河等村是光号召，不做计划，盲目生产；岩井村是有好榜样不表扬，有好办法不总结推广，使生产陷于自流。检查以后，大家讨论确定要用好的例子、好的办法推动大家，每个干部在生产中要领导好一个小组，经常做短期计划，按时检查，有成绩及时表扬，总结推广好的经验。暴家脚村发扬刘清任组按活订分的办法，都改成死分活订，生产情绪很快提高了。玉茭原计划八天锄完（每人每天锄六分），结果七天就锄完了。王金法组原计划五天完成拔苗，因为吸收了三个儿童、五个妇女，又起早吃饭上地，每个劳力一天平均多拔一分，四天就拔完了。高半曹组的辅助劳力也按活计工，有些妇女为了多做活，午间不休息就做好夜饭。男人起早上地，妇女做好饭，去地时把饭捎上，这样每人一天平均多做二分工。该村并注意培养妇女儿童：上地时先给她们做个样子，让她们学着做，做罢就检查，指出缺点，马上改正。全村吸收了二十七个妇女和二十二个儿童参加拔苗，妇女都能顶全劳力，省了不少男工。王金法组已抽出二人开油坊，准备全组玉茭的追肥。\n    　　　　　　　　　（金松、三锁、富兴）"

    "content": "[North Yue News] Extreme democracy occurred in Youpen Village, Lingshou Second District, delaying production. Everyone is satisfied after the correction. When the work team led the land reform in the village, they emphasized and publicized to the cadres and the masses that \"things should be discussed with the masses, and the masses should do what they want, and no one can monopolize it\"; they did not make it clear that \"the minority obeys the majority, the lower level obeys the upper level, and there must be centralization after democracy.\" In the third month of the lunar calendar, the village was preparing stretchers for supporting the front. The village cadres remembered that \"things should be discussed with the masses, and the masses should do what they want, and no one can monopolize it,\" so they did not dare to discuss methods in advance, but just called everyone to discuss without leadership. Every time a meeting was held, it was not early in the day when the masses from the subordinate villages thirteen or fourteen li away arrived. They chattered and argued for a while, but each time they couldn't figure out what to do. Once everyone had just reached a consensus, several people from the Zhao family disagreed and argued, and still couldn't make a decision, so they dispersed without results. At this time, it was the time for the masses to dig hillside land. Six mass meetings were held in half a month, and the people who would provide two stretchers were not determined, wasting five or six hundred workdays in vain, delaying the timely sowing of three hundred mu of corn land. (Leading comrades at all levels should learn how to hold meetings. It is right to \"discuss things with the masses, and no one can monopolize it.\" But \"the masses should do what they want\" is abandoning leadership and tailism. And holding meetings without preparing opinions in advance and just calling people to attend, chattering and arguing, and failing to make a decision, this is an empirical leadership method that must be corrected. – Editor) Later, Comrade Lao Chen from the county party committee arrived at Youpen and convened a meeting of party members, cadres, and some emancipated peasants to specifically study this issue. Everyone understood that when discussing things, if more than half of the people agree, it can be passed and executed, which is implementing democracy; those who disagree can reserve their own opinions, but they must also act according to everyone's opinions, and a few people cannot destroy and overturn everyone's resolutions, which is destroying democracy. There are many tasks in the village, and mass meetings cannot be held to discuss everything, big and small. When work comes, the cadres should discuss it first. Major events can be discussed in a representative meeting or mass meeting (try not to delay production), and minor events can be handled after the cadres discuss them. This does not mean that democracy is not being implemented. The village cadres are all elected by everyone, and everyone can raise opinions to them. After discussion, the thinking of the cadres and the masses began to be clarified. After the meeting, the two stretchers for supporting the front were quickly prepared, the cadres began to work boldly, and the masses also worked hard to produce peacefully.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 油盆村纠正极端民主　干部大胆工作群众安心生产\n友人\n1948-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　油盆村纠正极端民主\n  　干部大胆工作群众安心生产\n    【北岳讯】灵寿二区油盆村发生极端民主现象，耽误了生产，纠正后大家满意。工作组在该村领导土改时，向干部群众强调宣传“有事和群众商量，群众要怎么办就怎么办，谁也不能包办”；并没有把“少数服从多数，下级服从上级，有了民主还要有集中”说明白。阴历三月间，村中准备支前担架，村干部记住了“有事就要和群众商量，群众要怎么办就怎么办，谁也不能包办”，因此不敢事先讨论办法，只是无领导的叫大伙去商量。每次开会等十三、四里外的属村群众赶到，天气便不早了。七嘴八舌的吵一顿，每次都嚷不出个眉眼来。一次大家刚刚商量的意见一致了，赵家几个人不同意，吵一顿，还决议不了，无结果而散。这时正当群众刨坡地的时候，半月开了六次群众大会，出两付担架的人也没有确定出来，白白浪费了五、六百个工。耽误了三百亩玉茭地的及时播种。（各级领导同志，都应该学会如何开会，“有事和群众商量，谁也不能包办”，是对的。但“群众要怎么办就怎么办”，则是放弃领导的尾巴主义，而开会不事先准备好意见，就随便叫人来开会，七觜八舌，作不出个决定来，这是经验主义的领导方法，必须纠正。——编者）后来县委老陈同志到了油盆，召集党员、干部及部分翻身农民开了个会，专门研究这个问题。大家懂得了大伙讨论事情，半数以上同意了，就可以通过执行，这就是实行了民主；不同意的人可以保留自己意见，但也要按大家意见去办，不能几个人破坏和推翻大家的决议，就是破坏民主。村中工作很多，不能大小事都开群众大会商量。工作来了干部先讨论一下，大事开个代表会或群众会（尽量不要耽误生产）商量一下，小事干部讨论一下就可以办了。这并不是不实行民主。村干部都是大家选的，大家有意见可以向他们提。经过讨论，干部群众思想开始搞通了。会后，支前的两付担架很快的准备出来，干部开始大胆的作工作，群众也安心的努力生产。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（友人）"

Workers at the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company's lighterage department, protesting that their June salary index only doubled, demanded a two-and-a-half-fold increase in accordance with the price index, and when this was not met, began a slowdown at the end of June.

According to representatives from the cinema workers, the workers' lives had reached the point of unsustainability.

Bare-backed villagers, with their pants rolled up, are in the fields next to the pools, some applying fertilizer, some hoeing seedlings. The seedlings are chopstick-high, tender green, and in rows. This is the indigo that the farmers of Zhidu Village rely on to get rich.\n\n    Zhidu Village has been growing indigo continuously for four years. In the first year, when they started experimenting, people were afraid of wasting their efforts. Only Qin Luo Fatty and his younger brother Qin Zhaolin and eight other households planted fifteen or sixteen mu. When Qin Luo Fatty pulled up the wheat to plant indigo, his wife disagreed, saying, \"If you don't plant yams or beans, what will you eat?\" Luo Fatty didn't listen to her, thinking, \"Let's give it a try.\" So he and Zhaolin planted one and a half mu together. When the indigo was harvested at the beginning of autumn, it wasn't sold right away, and his wife complained, \"You eat indigo!\" The villagers also ridiculed him, saying, \"If you can't sell the indigo, it's good for whitewashing walls.\" Some called them the \"Embrace Poverty Team.\" But in less than a few days, the indigo was sold out, which was unexpected. The price was very high. The production from one and a half mu of indigo could buy ten shi of millet. He and his brother bought a waterwheel and a donkey together, and immediately planted another crop of vegetables. People who hadn't planted indigo saw them getting rich. The second year, when the cadres came to the village to mobilize people to plant indigo, the village naturally increased by seventeen households, planting more than fifty mu. Luo Fatty planted skillfully. In the first year, he harvested one shi and two dou of wheat from 1.2 mu, and sold the indigo for 1.6 million yuan. In the third season, he harvested six cartloads of cabbage, selling them for one million yuan, leaving two carts for the whole family to eat all winter. He bought another donkey. The amount of fertilizer in the fields also increased unprecedentedly, with 1,440 jin of sesame cake fertilizer applied to his 8.5 mu of land. Xin Zhongnong Wang Liang, a farming household who used to irrigate and roll the fields, also bought a waterwheel with Qin Gouzi last autumn, and bought a donkey himself this spring. Qin Xiaohei also bought an ox. Qin Luoxiu, who was the most in difficulty, also increased the amount of fertilizer in his fields, and his production was enough to eat. This year, the whole village has developed to more than fifty households planting indigo, with more than one hundred mu planted. Last year there were only three pools, this year they have increased to ten. Qin Luo Fatty and his brother have become indigo-making technicians in the village. Because they worked very meticulously, the dye houses came to buy from them, saying their goods were strong. Some merchants even asked Luo Fatty to buy on their behalf, effectively becoming an agent for selling indigo to the outside. Now the influence of Zhidu Village getting rich by growing indigo has spread to nearby villages, and five or six villages around it have begun to learn how to grow and make indigo.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 秦洛胖弟兄种靛发了家\n药夫　槐玉\n1948-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　秦洛胖弟兄种靛发了家\n    药夫、槐玉\n    一走到藁城只都村北，便看见路旁有几个长方形的大灰池子，洁白光亮。赤着背的老乡们卷起裤子，在池旁的地里，有的上粪，有的锄苗。苗子有筷子高、嫩绿成行，这便是只都村农民们赖以发财致富的蓝靛。\n    只都村连续种靛已经四年。第一年开头试验时，人们都怕白闹了，只有秦洛胖和他弟弟秦兆林等八户种了十五六亩。秦洛胖拔了麦子要种靛时，他媳妇不同意，说：“不栽山药不种豆你吃啥？”洛胖没听她的话，心想：“试试看。”便和兆林伙种了一亩半。立秋打下靛暂时没有卖出去，他媳妇埋怨说：“你吃靛吧！”村里的老乡也讽刺他说：“卖不了靛刷灰墙倒不错”。有的叫他们“抱穷队”。但是不到几天把靛卖完了，出乎别人意料之外，价钱很贵，一亩半靛的生产能够买十大石小米。他弟兄两个合买了一架水车和一头毛驴，立刻又种了一季菜。没种靛的人们看着他们发了财，第二年干部来村上动员种靛时，村里自然而然又增加了十七户，种了五十余亩。洛胖因种的得法，第一年一亩二分地打麦一石二，卖靛一百六十万元，第三季又收下白菜六大车，卖了一百万元，剩下两车全家吃了一冬。他又买了一头毛驴。地里的粪也空前增加，八亩半地上了一千四百四十斤麻饼。种靛户新中农王亮向来浇地打辘辘，去年过秋也与秦狗子合买了一辆水车，今春自己又买了一头驴。秦小黑也买了一头牛，最困难的秦洛休，地里也增加了肥料，生产的也够吃了。今年全村种靛已发展到五十余户，种靛百余亩。去年仅三个池子，今年增加到十个。秦洛胖弟兄成了村里打靛的技师。因为他们作的很细致，染坊里都找上门来买，并说数他们的货强。有的商人还托洛胖代买，实际上成了对外销靛的经记人。现在只都村种靛发财的影响，已传遍了附近村庄，在它周围已经有五、六个村庄开始学习种靛打靛了。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-23",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th. The famous Northeast forestry industry, devastated by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, suffered enormous losses. In recent years, under the vigorous leadership of the democratic government, it has rapidly recovered and gradually developed. After the establishment of the Northeast Forestry General Bureau this April, it has moved towards a path of unified planning and enterprise-based management. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the Northeast Liberated Area currently has a total forest area of 85 million hectares, accounting for about three-quarters of the country's forest area and 20 percent of the total area of ​​the Northeast. The forest area is 21.84 million hectares, with a reserve of 3.55 billion cubic meters. Among them, coniferous trees such as Pinus tabulaeformis and Pinus koraiensis, which have a wide range of uses, account for 46 percent. The forestry area is divided into eight regions according to natural conditions: the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, the Wanda Mountains, the Mudanjiang River Basin, the Tumen River Basin, the right bank of the Yalu River and the Hun River Basin, and Rehe. In the past year, the democratic government has repaired more than 1,100 kilometers of forest railways, which can transport more than one million cubic meters of timber annually, and rebuilt more than 30 state-owned electric sawmills. In addition, water gates, locomotives, ropeways, power plants and affiliated factories are also under active construction. According to statistics from six provinces, there are currently six forestry bureaus, twelve sub-bureaus, and a total of 69 other forestry stations and forest farms, with more than 20,000 employees. It is estimated that 1.45 million cubic meters of timber can be produced this year. Next year, the number of employees will increase to 60,000, with 50,000 livestock, and the timber output will reach more than 3 million cubic meters, which can fully meet military and civilian needs. By then, the forestry by-products such as tannin acid from wood distillation, various oils and fats, papermaking raw materials, medicinal materials, food and poultry will also have greater development. The person in charge continued: The rapid recovery of forestry in the Northeast is mainly due to the hard work of all employees under the leadership of the government. Under extremely difficult conditions with equipment, the employees devised various methods to restore the huge projects of railway bridges, water gates, and electric sawmills. At the same time, the government has also gone through an exploratory process and gained experience in managing and developing forestry. When the Northeast was first liberated, a large number of forestry facilities were destroyed by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Due to the lack of unified management, various regions only sought to solve the current \"needs\" without making long-term plans, which greatly affected the recovery and development of forestry. Last autumn, under the leadership of the Political Committee, forestry bureaus were successively established in various provinces to strengthen the management and operation of forestry. At the same time, the Political Committee also promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Forest Management, stipulating that the forests in the Liberated Area are state-owned and province-operated. It has formulated a number of measures to develop forestry, protect forests, and reward forest protection and afforestation. In April, the Northeast Forestry General Bureau was established to implement unified state operation. In addition to allocating large amounts of funds to operate forestry, the government also dispatched a large number of new and old cadres to engage in forestry work to strengthen operating organizations. It has also decided to widely mobilize the masses this winter, based on the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, to develop cooperative undertakings in logging and transportation; and resolutely correct the past practice of a few localities adopting the method of war-time mobilization for logging. The local financial tasks borne by the forestry bureaus of various provinces in the past have also been decided to be cancelled. Finally, the person in charge said that the current development of forestry in the Northeast is based first on the economic construction plan, saving and accumulating timber, developing forestry and improving forestry facilities, and actively conducting investigation and research, and implementing planned periodic logging and cultivation, in order to achieve inexhaustible supply and use.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 统一计划加强管理东北林业迅速恢复\n\n1948-07-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　统一计划加强管理东北林业迅速恢复\n    【新华社东北十八日电】著名的东北森林业，遭受日寇及蒋匪摧残，损失极大，近年来在民主政府大力领导下，已迅速恢复并逐渐获得发展。今年四月东北林务总局成立后，更走向统一计划与经营企业化的途径。顷据该局负责人告记者称：东北解放区现有林野总面积八千五百万垧，约占全国林区四分之三，占东北总面积百分之二十。森林面积为二千一百八十四万垧，蓄积量卅五亿五千万立方米。其中用途广阔的黄花松、白花松等针叶树占百分之四十六。林业区按自然形势划分为大兴安岭、小兴安岭、完达山脉、牡丹江流域、图们江流域、鸭绿江右岸及浑河流域、热河等八个地区。一年来民主政府已修复森林铁道达一千一百余公里，每年可运输木材百余万立方米，重建公营电力锯木厂卅余所。此外水闸、机车、绳条、发电所及附属工厂等均在积极修建中。据六个省统计：现有林务局六所，分局十二所，其他林务所、林场等共六十九处，有职工两万余人。预计本年度可出材一百四十五万立方米。明年则将增加职工至六万人，牲口五万匹，出材三百余万立方米，可足供军需民用。届时森林之副业生产如木材干馏之单宁酸、各种油脂、造纸原料、药材、食料及禽兽等亦将有更大的发展。该负责人继称：东北林业的迅速恢复，主要是由于全体职工在政府领导下艰辛努力的结果。职工们曾在器材极端困难的条件下，想各种办法恢复了铁路桥梁、水闸及电力锯、木厂等巨大工程。同时，政府亦经过了摸索过程，取得了管理与发展林业的经验。当东北初解放时，各地林业设备大量遭受日寇及蒋匪破坏，又因无统一管理，各地只求解决目前“需要”，不作长期打算，大大影响林业的恢复与发展。去年秋天各省乃在政委会领导下先后成立林务局，加强了林业的管理与经营。同时政委会并颁布森林管理暂行条例，确定解放区森林为国有省营。订出发展林业，保护森林及奖励护林造林多项办法。四月间更成立东北林务总局以实行统一国营。政府除拨大量资金经营林业外，并派遣大批新老干部从事林业工作，加强经营机构。并决定今冬广泛发动群众，根据公私两利原则，发展采伐与运输的合作事业；坚决纠正过去少数地方采取战勤动员方式采伐的办法。过去各省林务局负担之地方财政任务，亦决定取消。最后该负责人称，目前发展东北林业，首先是根据经济建设计划，节用与积存木材，发展林业与健全林业设备，并积极进行调查研究，实行有计划的定期开采与培植，以期达到取之不尽，用之不竭。"

The district is located close to the Anyang River, which is three to four zhang wide. There is a section of embankment, about half a li long, which has been eroded by the river water over the years, and is now two zhang and five chi lower than the original embankment. Under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn elements Wang Ziquan and Cheng Daosheng, the local people had neither the leadership nor the will to repair it. Every year when the rainy season came, the river water would surge over the banks, causing serious flooding. In Qicun, Wadian, and other eighteen villages, tens of thousands of acres (a quarter of the total cultivated land) of autumn crops were often flooded, some turning into water pits, some becoming river channels, leading to years of famine. In view of this, our Fifth District Government took advantage of the gap between sowing and weeding this year to convene a meeting of village cadres to mobilize and arrange embankment repairs. Comrade Chen Lianbin, the deputy district chief, personally went to the river embankment to observe and, according to the size of the project and the amount of labor available in each village, divided the project into several sections and assigned them to each village.

Some villages organized women's mutual aid groups, but because no one led them, the organizations collapsed after being formed. (2) Failure to combine women's demands with family demands. Some women are still restricted in their labor. Parents and husbands do not sympathize with their daughters-in-law going to the fields to work. If they participate in mutual aid, they are bullied by their families. The money earned by women from production is all handed over to the family. They can't even afford to buy a handkerchief, and they are not motivated to work. (3) The phenomenon of non-voluntary and unequal exchange also exists in women's mutual aid. The mutual aid group has become a muddled group, which greatly affects women's participation in mutual aid. In response to the above shortcomings, the Women's Federation determined: (1) Women's mutual aid must implement the three major principles of voluntary combination, equivalent exchange, and democratic leadership. (2) Women's earned wages can be distributed between the women and the family according to the actual situation. Some places have adopted an 20/80 split (family gets 80%, women get 20%), which greatly encourages women's labor. (3) Systematically cultivate key personnel and establish a leadership core. (4) In terms of organizational form, don't demand too much at once. It should develop gradually from small to large.

    "content": "[Urgent telegram from the Jiluyu (combination of Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces) region on the 19th] The flood season has arrived, and the Yellow River's water level is critically high. The lives and property of millions of people in Henan are in grave danger due to the Chiang bandits' frenzied sabotage of our repair and defense work. In addition to U.S.- Chiang aircraft bombing our river defense works, villages, and repair personnel day and night, the Chiang bandits' 5th and 68th Divisions, in conjunction with local bandits, invaded all river defense works along a 300-mile stretch from Gaocun (under the jurisdiction of Dongming) in the west to Kunshan in the east on the 17th and 18th. They set fire to over 400,000 catties of straw materials for river management in Kunshan, and also looted straw from Jiangsu Dam. All repair workers were dispersed by the enemy, forcing the suspension of emergency repair projects. The water situation is now extremely critical, and if a breach occurs, dozens of counties in Henan will be turned into a watery realm. In order to prevent the Yellow River from breaching, the Jiluyu Yellow River Commission began to fully repair famous dangerous projects on the south bank of the Yellow River, such as Gaocun, Zhukou, Liuzhuang, and Jiangsu Dam, in late June. The dangerous projects above the twelve dams of Gaocun had already been repaired by us. On July 4, dangers arose at the 13th and 14th dams, and U.S.- Chiang aircraft took advantage of the situation to bomb these dangerous projects day and night, starting on the 7th, as many as fifteen times each night, killing and wounding a total of more than 150 repair workers and local people. Three of our large repair ships were also sunk. However, our Yellow River Commission's repair and defense office still led the workers to bravely repair day and night, risking enemy aircraft bombing and strafing, investing 400,000 bricks and 600,000-700,000 catties of willow branches. The 13th dam project was largely completed, and the 14th dam project was also completed to a basic height of 6.3 meters, making the dam 1.5 meters above the water surface, only about 1 meter away from completion.

Recently, the enemy transported approximately 1 billion yuan of fake 1000-yuan Southern Hebei currency from Beiping to Baoding. On May 28th, a shop in Anyang discovered 10 million yuan in fake 1000-yuan Southern Hebei currency. Large quantities of counterfeit currency have been discovered in the Taihang Third and Fifth Sub-districts and the Taiyue area. In Jinzhuang Village, Huguan, the masses captured nine counterfeit currency peddlers within ten days, seizing 2.95 million yuan in fake currency and a large sheet of fake tobacco tax stamps. The local armed forces in Zhangnan, northern Henan, captured a counterfeit currency criminal – Li Jinxiu, the uncle of the stubborn puppet leader Wang Ziquan – and found over 100,000 yuan in fake currency. According to Li's confession, he was specifically responsible for selling fake currency in the Guangping, Feixiang, and Daming areas. He also stated that the stubborn bandit leaders Wang Ziquan and Liu Lexian had established six or seven counterfeit currency printing locations in the urban area of Anyang, issuing them in large quantities. Various types of counterfeit currency have been discovered, including the 1000-yuan red edition, the 500-yuan green edition, the single-numbered 500-yuan yellow background green edition, the large 500-yuan blue edition, the light pink edition, and six types of 200-yuan currency. Their method of promotion involves using armed force to coerce exchanges, utilizing border merchants, hooligans, spies, and ordinary women and children to sell the currency in our interior. They mix new and old currency, real and fake currency, and large and small denominations, or use large denomination fake currency to buy small items and exchange for real currency. Or, when buying something, they first give a fake note to see if you can recognize it; if you can't, they use a large amount of fake currency to purchase goods. The Taihang Branch of the Southern Hebei Bank has specifically instructed all localities to quickly organize a mass anti-counterfeit currency campaign, teach the masses to identify real and fake currency, and widely publicize the issue to the masses, urging everyone to pay attention, everyone to inspect, not to let go of a single counterfeit currency criminal, and not to let a single grain of food or a single thread of material fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 严查假票　蒋匪阴谋捣乱金融无耻制造假冀南票\n\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　严查假票\n  　蒋匪阴谋捣乱金融无耻制造假冀南票\n    【太行电】冀南银行太行区行月来接获各地报告，安阳与平津等地蒋匪为盗取我区物资，捣乱我区金融贸易，现正伪造百元、五百元与一千元票额冀钞，大量向我区渗入。最近敌由北平运往保定假冀钞千元券约十亿元。五月二十八日，安阳商店查获假冀钞千元券千万元。太行三、五分区及太岳区均发现大批假票。壶关晋庄群众十天内查获假票贩九名，带假票二百九十五万元，并有假烟税印花一大张。豫北漳南地方武装捕获假票犯——顽伪头子王自全的舅父李金秀，查出假票十余万元。据李供称：彼专门负责往广平、肥乡、大名一带推销假票。并称：顽匪头子王自全、刘乐先在安阳城关设立印假票所六、七处，大量印发。各种假票已发现千元券大红版、五百元券绿版、单号码五百元券黄底绿版、大五百元券蓝版、浅粉红版及二百元券六种。其推行办法，系用武装力量强迫兑换，利用边地商人、流氓、特务及一般妇女、小孩，带往我内地推销。以新旧票、真假票、大小票混合使用，或以大额假票买零星东西，换回真票。或在买东西时先给一张假票，看你是否认得出，如认不出，即用大批假票购货。冀南银行太行区行特指示各地，迅速组织一个群众性的反假票运动，教会群众辨认真假票，广泛向群众宣传，大家注意，人人检查，不放过一个假票犯，不让一颗粮食、一丝物资落入敌手。"

    "content": "In the appendix of the eleventh issue of the magazine \"World Economy and World Politics,\" which was published not long ago, was published a stenographic record of a debate on F. Varga's book \"Changes in the Capitalist Economy Caused by the Second World War.\" This debate was held at a joint meeting of the Political Economy Department of the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Political Economy Department of Moscow State Lomonosov University.\n\nThe goal of the discussion was to determine the correctness of the various issues concerning modern capitalism and its development prospects as expounded in Comrade Varga's book.\n\nDuring the debate, Comrade Varga said in his address: \"If you ask me whether I think it is necessary to correct some theoretical viewpoints one and a half years later (referring to the time after the publication of Varga's book – translator's note), (apart from the issue of the characteristics of people's democracy) I should answer, comrades, no need.\"\n\nMany speeches by well-known economists correctly criticized many basic arguments in Comrade Varga's book, exposing the serious political and theoretical errors contained in the book. However, some speeches attempted to defend the obvious non-Marxist viewpoints in Comrade Varga's book. It should be noted that Comrade Varga still believed that it was unnecessary to criticize these fundamental errors when the discussion record was published half a year later.\n\nWhat conclusions did Comrade Varga draw when examining the current stage of the general crisis of capitalism? According to his opinion, what is the most essential change in the capitalist economy after the Second World War?\n\nComrade Varga's book unexpectedly starts from the question of the role of the state in the economies of capitalist countries. It is unexpected because readers reasonably believe that it is first necessary to analyze the wartime economy of capitalist countries, the laws of its development, the internal contradictions of monopoly capitalism and their forms of expression. Only after this can we understand the role of the bourgeois state in the economy.\n\nMarxists do not deny the reactive effect of the bourgeois state on the economy. Marxists believe that the capitalist economy does not rely on the state, but develops according to spontaneous laws. Under no circumstances can the bourgeois state play a decisive role in the development of the capitalist economy.\n\nComrade Varga, however, draws a different conclusion: \"One of the main phenomena of the Second World War is that in all bourgeois countries—belligerent and neutral—the state acquired a decisive significance in the wartime economy.\" (Page 15)\n\nDuring the debate, Comrade Varga not only insisted on this view, but also gave a broader explanation. He said: \"My statement about the reduction of the state's role after the war may not be entirely correct.\" From his speech, it can be interpreted that the bourgeois state acquired a decisive significance not only in the wartime economy, but also in the post-war economy.\n\nFor any Marxist, as long as he is a true Marxist, he will understand that the theory of the decisive role of the bourgeois state (i.e., only in terms of the wartime economy) is equivalent to denying the role of the spontaneous economic development laws of capitalism; it is equivalent to saying that the capitalist wartime economy does not develop according to this law, but according to the omnipotent will of the state, and will continue to develop in this way for a long time to come. Starting from this point, one can reach the following conclusion: the bourgeois state can overcome the spontaneous action of the law of value, the general law of capital accumulation, the law of proletarian impoverishment, crises and unemployment, and may even become planned.\n\nComrade Varga stated in his address that the theory that economic planning under capitalist conditions is impossible is outdated, and attempted to prove the opposite argument. He said: \"Let me discuss the issue of planning under capitalist conditions. On this issue, we are often dominated by old theories: believing that we can achieve a planned economy, but in capitalism, the anarchy of production permanently and indiscriminately dominates everything. I think this way of looking at the problem is wrong.\" According to Comrade Varga, the economy of capitalist countries is advancing on some kind of \"planned basis,\" and organizations similar to our unique \"State Planning Commission\" have also appeared in some capitalist countries.\n\nThe fundamental error that Comrade Varga made in estimating the role of the bourgeois state in the economy lies in the fact that he observes this issue by separating it from monopoly capitalism, and even opposes the state to the monopoly. Comrade Varga wrote: \"The bourgeois state represents the interests of the entire bourgeoisie. Its goal is to try to properly utilize the state's entire resources for the purpose of war, and therefore it is constantly in conflict with the partial interests of individual capital enterprises and their pursuit of high profits.\" (Page 10)\n\nThe book repeatedly emphasizes the existence of contradictions between the state and the monopoly during the war. The debate correctly pointed out that this view would lead to the conclusion of recognizing the supra-class nature of the bourgeois state.\n\nThe modern state in imperialist countries manifests as the dictatorship of capitalists—monopolists and financial oligarchies. When examining state-controlled economies, one must not forget that it is for the purpose of maximizing profits, realized by monopolists through the state. Comrade Stalin said: \"Although there is a 'democratic' parliament, many capitalist governments are ruled by big banks. Parliament wants to make people believe that they supervise the government, but in fact, the government officials themselves and their actions are ruled by big financial groups.\" (Collected Works of Leninism, 10th edition, page 174)\n\nThe essential characteristic of monopoly capitalism is manifested in the integration of state institutions and capital monopolies, giants of finance capital, and the plunderers of monopoly capital using state institutions to obtain high extra profits.\n\nThe essence of the economic changes in capitalist countries during the Second World War is manifested in the extremely increased role of capitalist monopolies using state institutions to seize new sales markets and raw materials to divide the world. The main driving force of the wartime economy is capitalist monopolies, and the policies of the bourgeois state are subordinate to its interests, and the latter has no ability to slightly oppose the interests of capitalist monopolies and financial oligarchies. If the bourgeois state slightly exceeds the scope of monopoly interests when formulating plans, it will inevitably be doomed to failure.\n\nComrade Varga explained during the debate: \"The state had to try to impose some restrictions on profits during the war\" and the state's regulation of prices \"was not for the benefit of the monopoly.\" These statements are inconsistent with the facts. In fact, the profits of capitalist monopolies during the war were far greater than usual. What kind of state restrictions on capitalists are there when American monopoly capitalists increased their profits from 6.4 billion US dollars in 1939 to 24.5 billion US dollars in 1943, and earned 87 billion US dollars under the counteraction of the government during the four years of the war!\n\nFurthermore, the leaders of the American wartime economy themselves denied the \"decisive role of the state in the economy.\" The debate cited a section from the book \"Arsenal of Democracy: The History of U.S. Munitions Production\" by Donald Nelson, the head of the U.S. War Production Board. Nelson wrote: \"Industry tells us its needs and when it needs them. We can only formulate the kind of regulations that industry wants. This proposition is the decisive factor.\"\n\n　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×\nThe speeches in the debate concerning the role of the state under monopoly capitalism cannot be ignored. The speech by Tuolaha Tianbeierge (脱拉哈·天培尔戈) was completely wrong. He had previously overestimated the role of the bourgeois state in the economy. In this debate, he supported Comrade Varga's erroneous arguments. For example, he said: \"It must be admitted the principle of state intervention in the economy.\" In fact, Tuolaha Tianbeierge (脱拉哈·天培尔戈) fell into the position of bourgeois apologist with this view, deviating from the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the role of the bourgeois state.\n\nWhen Evuntov (埃闻托夫) participated in the debate to defend Varga's views, he completely fell into extremely obvious bourgeois theories. He believes that \"the state does not directly interfere in the issue of exploitation of the proletariat.\" His understanding is unconditional. He repeated this view, which is completely supported by the servants of the bourgeoisie—reformists, twice during his speech. With this view, Evuntov (埃闻托夫) distorted the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the bourgeois state. As is well known, the bourgeois state is a tool for exploiters to oppress the laboring masses.\n\nWhen Smid (斯米德) talked about the combination process of huge monopoly capital and the state, he believed that this process means that a certain movement is constantly being completed that is moving towards a new stage or a new stage of development. Is a new stage of monopoly capitalism possible? This is not a new question. Lenin gave a very detailed answer in the struggle against Kautsky's theory of ultra-imperialism. Monopoly capitalism is the latest and final stage of capitalist development, the eve of the socialist revolution. The trend of creating state monopoly capitalism and military state monopoly capitalism forms between wars is the manifestation of the basic contradictions and essence of monopoly capitalism. It does not form a special new stage of capitalist development.\n\nMonopoly capitalism in this form is the highest stage of production socialization that can be achieved under capitalist conditions. Lenin wrote: \"The imperialist war is the eve of the socialist revolution. This is not only because the disasters caused by the war produce proletarian uprisings—if socialism is not economically mature, then no uprising will create socialism—but because state monopoly capitalism is the most perfect material preparation for socialism, the threshold for entering socialism, a stage on the historical ladder such that there are no intermediate stages between this stage and the one called socialism.\" (Collected Works of Lenin, Vol. 21, p. 187) Capitalism has reached a mature stage in the time of the general crisis of capitalism.\n\n　　　　　　　　　(To be continued)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于一个经济学问题的论战\n依·拉甫捷夫\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于一个经济学问题的论战\n    依·拉甫捷夫\n    不久以前出版的“世界经济与世界政治”杂志第十一期的附录，曾发表了争论Ｆ·瓦尔加的著书“第二次世界大战所引起的资本主义经济的变化”的速记记录。这个争论是在苏联科学院经济研究院政治经济部、和莫斯科国立罗姆诺索夫大学的政治经济系的联席会上举行的。\n    讨论的目标是为了判明瓦尔加同志书中所阐述的现代资本主义及其发展前途的各种问题之正确程度如何。\n    争论时瓦尔加同志在致辞中曾说：“如果你们问我在一年半以后（指瓦氏著书出版后——译者注）是否认为必须改正某种理论上的观点，（除了论述人民民主特质的问题以外）我应该答道，同志们，不需要。”\n    许多著名的经济学者的发言都对瓦尔加同志书中的很多基本论点加以正确的批判，揭露了该书中含有的政治上理论上的严重错误。但是一部分的发言却企图辩护瓦尔加同志书中的明显的非马克思主义的观点。应当注意：瓦尔加同志在半年后出版讨论记录时，仍然认为批评这些原则上的错误是不必要的。\n    瓦尔加同志检讨资本主义总危机的现阶段时曾得出何种结论呢？按照他的意见，第二次世界大战后资本主义经济变化中最本质的又是什么呢？\n    瓦尔加同志的著书完全出乎意料地从国家在资本主义各国经济中的作用的问题出发。它是出乎意料的。因为读者合理的认为首先需要分析资本主义国家的战时经济、它的发展的规律，独占资本主义的内在矛盾及其表现的形式。只有如此之后，才能了解资产阶级国家在经济中的作用。\n    马克思主义者不否认资产阶级国家对经济的反作用。马克思主义者认为资本主义经济并不依靠国家，乃是根据自发法则而发展的。资产阶级国家在任何条件下也不能在资本主义经济发展上起决定的意义。\n    瓦尔加同志却得出另外的结论：“第二次世界大战的主要现象之一，便是在一切资产阶级国家内——交战国与屯立国，国家在战时经济上获得了决定的意义。”（一五页）\n    在争论时瓦尔加同志不仅坚持这个主张，而且加以更广泛的解释。他说：“我的关于战争结束后国家的作用将会减少的论述或者不完全正确。”从他的发言可以解释为：资产阶级国家不但在战时经济里，而且在战后经济里也获得了决定的意义。\n    对于任何马克思主义者，只要他是真正的马克思主义者，便会了解资产阶级国家的决定作用的理论（即仅就战时经济而言）就等于否认资本主义自发经济发展规律的作用；等于说资本主义战时经济不根据这规律，而是按照万能的国家意志而发展的，并且今后也要长久如此地发展。从这点出发，便能够到达了如下的结论：资产阶级国家可以克服价值法则的自发作用、资本蓄积的总法则、无产阶级贫困化的法则、危机和失业，甚至可能变成计划性。\n    瓦尔加同志在致辞中说明资本主义经济计划化不可能的理论业已陈旧，并企图证明相反的论据。他说：“让我来讨论在资本主义条件下计划性的问题。关于这问题，我们时常被旧理论所支配：认为我们能实现计划经济，但在资本主义则生产的无政府状态永久而无差别的支配一切。我认为这样看问题是不对的。”照瓦尔加同志的意见，资本主义国家的经济正在某种“计划性的基础上”前进着，在若干资本主义国家，类似我们独特的“国家计划委员会”的组织也出现了。\n    瓦尔加同志在估计资产阶级国家在经济中的作用时所犯的基本错误，在于他离开资本主义独占而观察这一问题，甚至把国家和独占对立起来。瓦尔加同志写道：“资产阶级国家代表整个资产阶级的利益。他的目标是在战争目的之下，尽力适当地利用国家的全资源，因此便不断地与个别资本企业的局部利益，和他们追求高额利润的利害关系相冲突。”（一○页）\n    书中更屡次强调在战时国家与独占间存在着矛盾。论战的发言中正确地指出这种见解会得出承认资产阶级国家的超阶级性的结论。\n    现代国家在帝国主义的国度里表现为资本家——独占者和金融寡头制的专政。检讨国家统制经济时，不可忘记它是为了尽可能地追求高额利润，被独占者通过国家而实现的。斯大林同志说：“虽然存在着‘民主的’国会，但很多的资本主义政府被大银行统治。国会想使人们相信他们监督政府，而实际上政府的官员本身及其行动却被大的金融集团所统治。”（列宁主义问题第十版一七四页）\n    独占资本主义的本质的特征表现于国家机构和资本独占，金融资本巨头的一体化，独占资本的掠夺者利用国家机构去获得高度额外利润。\n    第二次世界大战资本主义国家的经济变化的本质，表现于为了攫取新销售市场和原料以分割世界，利用国家机构的资本主义独占的作用极为增大。战时经济的主要动力乃是资本主义独占，资产阶级国家的政策服从于它的利益，后者没有任何能力去稍有抵触于资本主义独占与金融寡头的利益。资产阶级国家在拟定计划时若稍微越过独占利益的范围，它就不可避免的要注定失败。\n    瓦尔加同志在争论时说明：“国家在战时不得不设法对利润加以某种限制”及国家调节物价“不是为了独占的利益”。这些说法皆与事实不符。实际上，资本主义独占在战时的利润较之平时远为增大。当美国独占资本家增大其利润，从一九三九年的六十四亿美金到一九四三年的二百四十五亿美金，当四年战争之间在政府的反作用一下赚了八百七十亿美金的时候，还有什么国家对资本家的限制！\n    并且，美国战时经济的领导者们本身就否认了“国家在经济上的决定作用”。论战时引用了美国军需生产管理局的负责人道纳尔·纳尔逊的“民主国家的兵工厂——美国军需生产的历史”书中的一节。纳尔逊写道：“工业告诉我们它的需要及其需要的时期。我们只能制定使工业所欲的那种法规。这个命题乃是决定的因素。”\n    　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×\n    不可忽视在论战里论及独占资本主义下国家的作用问题的发言。脱拉哈天培尔戈的发言完全是错误的。他以前就过高估计资产阶级国家在经济上的作用。这次论战他又支持了瓦尔加同志的错误论点。例如他说：“必须承认国家干涉经济的原则。”实际上脱拉哈天培尔戈就以这种观点堕落到资产阶级辩护人的立场，脱离了马列主义关于资产阶级国家作用的学说。\n    参加论战的埃闻托夫辩护瓦尔加的观点时，完全陷于极其明显的资产阶级的理论。他认为“国家不直接干涉对无产阶级的剥削问题”。他这种认识是无条件的。发言时他又二次的重述这种完全为资产阶级的奴仆——改良主义者所拥护的观点。埃闻托夫以其这种观点曲解了马列主义关于资产阶级国家的学说。如众所周知，资产阶级国家乃是剥削者压迫劳动大众的工具。\n    斯米德谈及巨大独占资本与国家的结合过程时，认为这过程意味着时刻在完成着趋向于新阶段或发展的新阶段的某种运动。独占资本主义发展的新阶段是否可能？这不是新问题。列宁在反对考茨基的超帝国主义理论的斗争里曾给以极为详尽的回答。独占资本主义是资本主义发展的最新而最后的阶段，是社会主义革命的前夜。在战争之间创设国家独占资本主义和军事国家独占资本主义形式的趋势，是独占资本主义的基本矛盾与本质的表现。它并不形成资本主义发展的特别新阶段。\n    独占资本主义在这形式内，是在资本主义条件下所可能达到的生产社会化的最高阶段。列宁写道：“帝国主义战争是社会主义革命的前夜。这不只是因为战争所造成的惨祸产生出无产阶级的起义，——如果社会主义在经济上尚未成熟，那么任何起义也不会创造出社会主义，——而是因为国家垄断资本主义是社会主义最完满的物质准备，是进到社会主义的门阶，是历史梯子上这样的一级，即从这一级到称为社会主义的那一级之间是没有任何中间阶段的。”（列宁全集二十一卷一八七页）资本主义在资本主义总危机的时候已经到达了成熟的阶段。\n    　　　　　　　　　（未完待续）"

The conference reviewed past educational work and discussed future middle school education guidelines, school systems, curriculum standards, and other issues. Currently, Jizhong has five middle schools with 2,477 male and female students. Over the past decade, middle schools and equivalent training classes run by agencies above the district level alone have trained over 15,000 cadres of various types. During the war, there was an urgent need for a large number of cadres, and students were recruited and transferred at any time, with the longest study period being no more than a year and a half. Therefore, it was difficult to achieve the goal of cultivating a certain level of cultural literacy and scientific knowledge. In his concluding remarks, Liu @, Director of the Education Department of the Administrative Office, pointed out that in the past, middle school education had to adopt short-term training courses to meet the needs of the war. Currently, based on the development of the North China situation, under the principle of necessary and possible construction, some wartime facilities should be changed and gradually move towards regularization. The current guideline for middle school education should be to cultivate young people with a certain level of cultural literacy and scientific knowledge, who can participate in various construction tasks after a certain amount of professional training. The nature of middle school education is general education, and its task is to improve culture, with cultural education as the primary focus. The school system is temporarily set at three years, and no easy transfer is allowed if the semester is not completed; in order to meet the current needs of work, each middle school is still allowed to run short-term classes at the same time, with a minimum study period of one year. Enrollment requires a primary school graduation or equivalent education, and the entrance examination must be strict. Graduation is only allowed after passing the examination after three years of study. Each middle school is directly managed by the Administrative Office. All matters related to changes in educational plans, school administration, the appointment and removal of main cadres and teachers, and the assignment of students after graduation are directly decided by the Administrative Office. Each special district has the responsibility to supervise the specific implementation of the school.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中召开中学教育会议　规定教育方针任务\n\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中召开中学教育会议\n  　规定教育方针任务\n    【冀中讯】冀中行署召开的中学教育会议，于六月二十四日结束。会上检讨了过去的教育工作，讨论了今后中学教育方针、学制、课程标准等问题。目前冀中共有五个中学，男女学生二四七七人。十年来，仅分区以上机关主办的中学及相当中学的训练班，培养各种干部一万五千余人。战时迫切需要大量干部，学生随招随调，学习时间最长的不过一年半，因此很难达到培养一定文化程度和科学知识的目的。作结论时，行署教育厅柳＠厅长指出：过去中学教育为了适应战争需要，不得不采取短期训练班的办法。目前根据华北形势的发展，在必要和可能建设的方针下，应改变过去某些战时设施，逐渐走向正规化。目前中学教育的方针，应为培养有一定文化程度和科学知识的青年，毕业后经过一定的专业训练，即能参加各项建设工作。中学教育的性质是普通教育，其任务在于提高文化，应以文化教育为主。学制暂定为三年，凡学期未满不准轻易调动；为解决目前工作之需要，仍允各中学同时开办短期班，学习时间最少一年。入学程度必须具有高小毕业或同等学力者，入学考试必须严格，修学三年考试及格始得毕业。各中学由行署直接管理，凡有关改变教育计划、学校行政、主要干部及教员的任免，以及学生毕业后分配工作等，统由行署直接决定。各专署有督导学校具体执行之责。"

    "content": "Reporter of the North China General Branch\n  　Summarizes this Year's Wheat Collection Work\n  　Some Areas Still Show Disguised Forced Order Phenomena\n    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] A reporter from the North China General Branch summarized problems existing in certain areas regarding this year's wheat collection, stating: \"This year's wheat collection quota is very light,\" and \"This year's wheat collection is relatively reasonable.\" From reports from various locations, this seems to be the general reflection of the masses. Party and government leading organs in various places have held meetings to explain the rationale behind abolishing the unified progressive tax and the spirit of the new tax regulations, and reviewed and corrected various problems in wheat collection. In many places, wheat collection has become a conscious movement among the masses, implementing self-reporting and public discussion. The past style of simply completing tasks through forced orders has been greatly reduced, which is good. However, there are still some problems worth considering amidst the progress: (1) Party members and cadres taking the lead by over-reporting: \"In Bei Wuhe Village, Lingshou, at the summer grain collection conference, eight Party members voluntarily paid an extra two dou and eight sheng. This influenced eleven liberated peasant households to actively self-report, and they paid an extra three dou, seven sheng, and four he. Shi Lianfu harvested three dou of wheat, should have paid five sheng and four ge, but he paid an extra four sheng and six ge, totaling one dou.\" This method of Party members and cadres taking the lead by over-reporting seems good at first glance, but the result is that the masses, who were originally unwilling to over-report, were forced to follow suit. Shi Lianfu harvested three dou and paid one dou, which is obviously excessive and not voluntary. In Xiaobi Village, Third District, Huolu, after the summer grain collection issues were explained at the meeting, many cadres challenged the masses, saying: \"We will pay everything before breakfast tomorrow and guarantee the cleanliness of the wheat.\" Wang Tongxuan immediately followed, saying: \"You are early? I will be even earlier than you. The conditions are the same for all of us. We will all prepare winnowing fans and see who can clean it the most?\" More than ten people, including Wang Mingxuan and Luo Rong, accepted the challenge. Finally, Wang Zhixuan said: \"We will see the results tomorrow, no empty talk.\" As soon as Wang Zhixuan finished speaking, many people murmured unofficially, \"Who doesn't want to pay?...\" From the masses' \"unofficial murmurs,\" it seems that this type of challenge can lead to two negative consequences. On the one hand, it can create a disguised forced order for the masses. In some areas, the masses under-reported the acreage and yield of wheat. Instead of patiently enlightening and educating the masses and launching fair discussions among them, cadres personally intervened. For example, cadres from the Yinzhuang work group in Chiping, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, personally measured the land of the masses because the self-reports were untrue, resulting in a \"standoff\" between the leaders and the masses and a stalemate. This is still an act of forced order that is divorced from the masses. On the other hand, it can make ordinary Party members feel that they \"cannot set an example\" or \"cannot take the lead.\" We believe that it is necessary for Communist Party members to set an example and take the lead, but it must take care of the majority and consider economic conditions. Excessive measures will lead to detachment from the masses and loss of the role of setting an example. All of these phenomena will have a very negative impact on the relationship between the masses and the government and the Party. (2) Many places emphasize a fast pace in order to be the first to complete the task. For example, in Gengjiazhuang, Boye, Central Hebei, when allocating quotas, cadres, in order to simplify matters and strive for a model, a few cadres discussed it and allocated quotas based on the combination of good and bad land, resulting in unfair and unreasonable phenomena. One household, Lao Heng, had a total of twelve mu of wheat land, harvested 1,152 jin, and paid 200 jin, accounting for 17.4% of the total wheat harvest; while another household, Gao Jixiu, planted three mu of wheat, harvested 144 jin, and paid 55 jin, accounting for 38% of the total wheat harvest. As a result, some were overburdened, and some were lightly burdened. Rushing for speed resulted in unfairness and unreasonableness, and of course, disregarded the mass line of self-reporting and public discussion. (3) In some individual areas, cadres still have illegal private apportionment of grain and money during wheat collection. Some village cadres in the Fifth District of Guangling, under the pretext of disaster relief and preferential treatment for resistance, arbitrarily and illegally apportioned grain and money, taking the opportunity to embezzle from it. Yulin Village apportioned 20 large shi at once, and Liujiagou apportioned 12 small shi and ten bolts of white cloth. Gaojiawa (a small natural village) has a total of nine households, of which four have a better life (middle peasants). These four households should have been responsible for one shi and two dou, but this time they were assigned one shi and three dou. The Wang family should have been responsible for one dou of public grain, but this time they were assigned three dou (millet). The village chief said, \"Whether you have it or not, you have to give it.\" In addition, in Lühan, Raoyang, Central Hebei, a poor peasant league representative harvested four shi of wheat, but he falsely reported it as one shi and five dou, and the masses did not dare to mention it. These phenomena are very serious and must be resolutely corrected. Embezzlement and illegal apportionment should be distinguished by severity and given legal sanctions accordingly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北总分社记者　综述今年麦征工作　某些地区仍有变象强迫命令现象\n\n1948-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华北总分社记者\n  　综述今年麦征工作\n  　某些地区仍有变象强迫命令现象\n    【本报特讯】华北总分社记者综述今年麦征中某些地区存在的问题称：“今年麦征数很轻”，“今年麦征比较合理”，从各地的报导中看来，这是群众普遍的反映。各地党政领导机关都开会解释了废除统一累进税的道理和新税则精神，检讨纠正了麦征中的各种毛病，麦征在很多地方形成群众自觉的运动，实行了自报公议，过去单纯为交任务而强迫命令的作风已经大大减少，这是好的。但在进步中还有些问题值得提出研究：（一）党员干部打先锋多报：“灵寿北五河村，在夏征大会上，有八个党员自愿多缴二斗八升，这样就影响了十一户翻身农民积极自报，又多缴出三斗七升四合，时连福打了三斗麦，应该缴五升四，他又多缴了四升六，共缴一斗。”这种党员干部打先锋多报的办法，猛一看去很好，但其结果，群众本不愿多报也只好被迫着跟多报起来，时连福打了三斗就缴了一斗，这显然是过重，不会出于自愿。获鹿三区小毕村，当开会说明了夏征问题后，不少干部向群众挑战说：“我们明天早饭以前，就要缴齐，并保证麦子干净。”王通选立刻接着说：“你们早？我比你们还要早，条件和你们一样，咱们都准备好扇车，看谁扇得净？”王明选、洛荣等十余人都应了战。最后王只选说：“明天见实的，不是说漂亮话。”王只选的话刚说完，便有不少的群众咕咕哝哝的非正式的说：“人家谁不愿意缴？……”。这里从群众“非正式的咕哝”看来，这种挑战方式会发生两种恶果，一方面对群众，可以造成变象的强迫命令。在有些地区，群众少报了种麦亩数和产量，这时不是耐心启发教育群众，使在群众中展开公平评议，却是干部亲自下手，如冀鲁豫茌平尹庄工作组干部，因为群众自报不实，就亲自下去丈量群众的土地，结果造成了领导和群众的“顶牛”，弄成僵局，这依然是强迫命令脱离群众的行动。另一方面，会使一般党员感到“模范不起”，“带头不起”。我们认为共产党员起模范带头作用是必须的，但须照顾多数，照顾经济条件，过火就会脱离群众失去模范带头作用。以上这些现象，都会造成群众对政府和党的关系以极不好的影响。（二）很多地方为抢先缴任务，强调快的作风。如冀中博野耿家庄，干部在分配数字时，为了简单省事，争取模范，少数干部商量了一下，就按好坏地搭配了一下分配下去，结果造成了不公平不合理的现象。一户叫老衡的，共十二亩麦地，打了一千一百五十二斤，缴了二百斤，负担占总麦收量的百分之十七点四；而另一户叫高济修的，种麦三亩，打了一百四十四斤，就缴了五十五斤，负担占总收麦量百分之三十八。这样一来，有的过重，有的过轻，抢快的结果是不公平不合理，当然也不顾走自报公议的群众路线了。（三）麦征中有个别地区的干部仍有非法私摊粮款的现象。广灵五区有的村干部假借救灾优抗之名，任意非法摊派粮款，趁机从中贪污。榆林村一次即摊廿大石，刘家沟摊十二小石、白布十匹。高家洼（一个小自然村）共九家，其中有四户生活较好（中农），该四家共应负担一石二斗，可是这次派了一石三斗，王家居应负担公粮一斗，这次就给他派了三斗（小米）。村长说：“有没有也得给。”此外，在冀中饶阳吕汉有一个贫农团代表打了四石麦子，他自己虚报成一石五斗，群众都不敢提。这些现象很严重，必须坚决纠正。贪污与非法摊派，应分轻重，分别给以法律制裁。"

The village originally planned to weed more than 1,380 mu of millet in twelve days, but it was completed in nine and a half days. One hundred women and children participated in weeding (compared to the usual 45 people), helping to weed a total of 547 mu of fields. They also took on all the miscellaneous tasks such as pushing the mill, grinding grain, and carrying water, saving a lot of male labor. In weeding, fixed labor was separated from flexible distribution, and equal value exchange was implemented, which improved labor efficiency. When the elderly were carrying manure and sowing seeds, they generally counted as half a labor force; but when weeding, because of their high skills and good weeding, they were upgraded to the same work-point value as a full labor force. The work-point method was determined through democratic discussion, on-the-spot inspection, and decisions on increasing or decreasing points. The work-point system was very strict: tickets were issued three times a day—early morning, late morning, and afternoon. Settlements were made immediately after the work was completed. Everyone was satisfied and worked hard. The production committee implemented collective leadership for weeding, with responsibility assigned by street, daily inspections, reports, exchanges of experience, and problem-solving. After party rectification, the awareness of branch party members has been raised, and they are now able to promote the masses through their own exemplary leading role. Party members Zhang Hu, Xingxi, and others took the lead in calling people early and leading the weeding in the mutual aid group, and helped the group leader plan work and solve problems, which promoted the entire group and changed some of the past dissatisfaction of the masses with party members, and strengthened the relationship between party members and the masses. During weeding, the production enthusiasm of the groups with party members participating was particularly high.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 发动辅助劳力参加耕作　后山村锄苗省工\n\n1948-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　发动辅助劳力参加耕作\n  　后山村锄苗省工\n    【太行电】陵川附城区后山村在干部与党员积极领导推动下，组织半辅劳力参加耕作，严格实行工票制度，锄苗中省工七百二十四个。该村原计划十二天锄谷一千三百八十余亩，结果九天半就完成了。参加锄苗的妇女儿童有一百人（较经常四十五人），合计帮助锄田五百四十七亩。且把推碾磨、担水等杂活全部担负起来，节省出许多男工。锄苗中实行死工活分，等价交换，提高了劳动效率。老年人在担粪下种时，一般顶半个劳力；但在锄苗时，因为技术高、锄的好，即提高到和全劳力一样记分。记分办法是经过民主讨论，就地检查，决定分数的增减。工票制度很严格：清早、前晌、后晌，一天三开票。生活做完即结算存欠。大家满意，干得有劲。生产委员会对锄苗实行集体领导，分街负责，每日检查汇报交流经验，解决问题。支部党员经过整党，觉悟提高，已能用自己的模范带头作用推动群众。党员张虎、兴喜等，在互助组内起早叫人，领头锄苗，并帮助小组长计划活计，解决问题，推动了全组，转变了过去群众对党员某些不满，密切了党员与群众的关系。锄苗中，凡有党员参加的小组，生产情绪即表现得分外高。"

    "content": "【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】On the 18th, 19th, and 23rd, various regions welcomed the first heavy rain since the summer, which continued until the 21st. Prior to this, rain had fallen successively in all areas of central Hebei, many counties in the Taihang and Taiyue regions, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, and areas such as Fuping in the North Yue region. However, a large portion of the entire region suffered from drought or had not received sufficient rain. This heavy rain raises hopes for the autumn harvest, and farmers are visibly delighted. In many areas, farmers are rushing to plant sweet potato seedlings in the rain, eagerly forming teams to inspect the crops in the rain, and preparing to rush to hoe. Party and government leading organs in various regions, without prior consultation, immediately inquired about the rainfall in various areas on the same day, calling on leading organs at all levels to immediately organize the masses to rush to hoe, replant, and diligently investigate the difficulties and demands of the people after the rain. It is reported that many regions, due to the severity of the drought, had prepared early on, with preparations such as seeds and labor mutual aid already in place, waiting for the good rain to fall before taking action. However, some Party and government organs have abandoned production leadership, and the preparations for replanting after the rain were not sufficiently made in advance. Currently, in areas where planting has not yet been completed (in the first district of Nanle, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, unplanted land accounts for 70% of the entire area), adjusting seed supplies has become a major problem. For example, some people want to plant buckwheat, but there is nowhere to buy seeds. Some areas have suffered successive years of poor harvests and are unable to replant. In the severely drought-stricken areas of the entire ninth district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and parts of the sixth and eighth districts, most of the autumn seedlings have died from drought. In Shanghe County alone, autumn seedlings killed by drought account for 30% of the entire county. Replanting has become the most urgent requirement. Furthermore, in many areas, due to excessive troop deployments and heavy corvee labor, there is insufficient manpower to rush to plant. This is most severe in the counties along the Yellow River. All of these require strong government support to specifically solve the difficulties. In areas where planting has already been completed, once the weather clears and the ground dries, efforts should be made to rush to hoe. The Party and government should provide planned leadership, such as adjusting labor, setting wages, providing substitute cultivation for military dependents, arranging land for migrant workers engaged in war service, and appropriately resolving the difficulties of households without labor. All of these should be reasonably resolved during the weeding campaign. In any region, it is necessary to combine this production with a large-scale ideological mobilization for production among all classes, eliminating the pessimistic sentiments that have grown due to the drought (such as the belief that \"even if it rains, the harvest will not be good\"), and encouraging everyone to actively struggle for a better harvest year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各地喜降透雨　应大力领导抢锄抢种\n\n1948-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各地喜降透雨\n  　应大力领导抢锄抢种\n    【本报特讯】十八、十九、二十三日各地喜降入夏以来的第一次大雨，至二十一日未停。在这以前，曾先后落雨者有冀中全部地区，太行太岳不少县份，冀鲁豫河南地区，以及北岳阜平等地，但全区有很大一部分地区苦旱或未落透雨，这次大雨，秋收有望，农民喜形于色，许多地区农民雨中赶插红薯秧，争相结队，冒雨看望田禾，准备抢锄。各地党政领导机关，均不约而同的于当日急询各地雨情，号召各级领导机关，立即组织群众在雨后抢锄，补种，抢锄，以及认真调查人民的困难和要求。据息：不少地区由于旱灾严重，党政领导机关，早有准备，诸如种子、劳力互助等已经准备好，只待好雨一降，就一齐动手，但也有些党和政府放弃生产领导，雨后抢种的准备工作事先均做得不够充分。目前在未种上的地方（冀鲁豫南乐一区未种土地占全区百分之七十），调剂种子已成一个很大的问题，如有人要求种荞麦，但种子没处去买；有的地方连遭歉年已无力补种；冀鲁豫九分区全部和六、八分区各一部旱灾严重地区，秋苗大部旱死，只尚和县全县旱死秋苗竟占百分之三十。补种成为最急切的要求。还有不少地区由于出兵过多及支差繁忙，人力不足用，抢种不过来。这以沿黄河各县最为严重。这些均需要政府大力扶助，具体解决困难。在已种上的地区，天晴地干就要全力抢锄，党和政府应有计划的领导，譬如劳力的调剂，工资的制定，军干属的代耕，在外担负战勤的民工土地的安排，无劳力户困难的适当解决……均要在锄苗运动中得到合理解决。无论在任何地区，都需要结合这次生产向各阶层进行大生产的思想动员，扫除曾因天旱而滋长的悲观情绪（譬如以为“下了雨也收不好”等说法），鼓励大家积极斗争，争取一个较好年成。"

    "content": "Taiyue Rewards More Livestock Feeding\n　　Jiyuan Increases Livestock by More Than 2,000 Head in Half a Year\n    [Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue Democratic Government rewards and helps the masses increase livestock and develop rural productivity. The Administrative Office promulgated measures on June 1st to reward livestock feeding, stipulating that for livestock purchased before bearing burdens this year, one-third of the purchase price will be deducted when bearing burdens. A portion of the animal feed will also be deducted. Many counties stipulate that if working livestock suffer losses, the government will provide compensation and treatment. The government has also issued large loans to help farmers purchase and breed. Many villages have compensated the losses of middle peasants who were wrongly struggled against, and they have begun to purchase livestock and engage in business with peace of mind. In Xiajiao Village, Er District, Yicheng, the day after compensating the losses of wrongly struggled against middle peasants, someone bought three head of livestock. After compensating the losses of middle peasants in Pang Village, Gaoping, middle peasant Wu Jizhou said: \"Now there's nothing to be afraid of, we must engage in production well in the future!\" and immediately went to buy an ox. Tan Renyan and others from Yang Village, Jiang County, after receiving grain from the government as compensation for livestock losses in the war effort, said: \"Now we don't have to be afraid, if livestock are requisitioned and something goes wrong, the government will still compensate!\" and immediately partnered with others to buy livestock. Jiyuan County has increased its livestock by more than 2,000 head this year, and Qin County has increased by more than 1,000 head. Jincheng Sixth District alone increased by 119 head, seven villages in Gaoping First District increased by 220 head, and sixteen villages in Fushan Third District increased by 215 head. Currently, the leadership in various regions is also promptly emphasizing that in mutual aid teams, labor exchange must be carried out at equal value, overcoming the past mistakes of unilaterally taking care of households without livestock and not implementing the principle of equal value exchange. This further encourages households with livestock to feed and breed with peace of mind.\n　　[Taiyue News] The Jiyuan Democratic Government has promoted the raising of more livestock in various ways, and the county has increased its livestock by more than 2,000 head in the past six months. In order to reward livestock breeding, the regulations on exemption from labor service for breeding male animals, pregnant female animals, and young animals with two pairs of teeth are resolutely implemented in war service, and compensation and medical treatment are given for those injured or killed in service. In March, the government spent 2.07 million (Ji banknotes) on medical and compensation expenses, thereby dispelling the masses' concerns about being afraid of labor service and unwilling to raise more livestock. After the outbreak of livestock plague this spring, a forum of veterinarians was immediately convened, and ten veterinarians were organized to go to the countryside to treat livestock, saving more than 500 sick livestock from death. The method of encouraging veterinarians to take on more apprentices was promoted to develop the business. In addition, a forum of livestock breeding experts from the county was convened to overcome the misconception that breeding is an \"ugly thing\" and the neglect of breeding, and a banner was awarded to breeding expert Huang Cunkai. Currently, there are four or five people in the county who specialize in this business, which greatly facilitates livestock breeding. In the mutual aid production movement, the county party committee and government repeatedly emphasized to cadres at all levels that \"livestock mutual aid must be equal and voluntary,\" overcoming the erroneous view of cadres unilaterally \"taking care of households without livestock,\" and gradually dispelling the masses' concerns about suffering losses from mutual aid in raising livestock. The government's stipulated deduction of one-third of the purchase price and reward measures are resolutely implemented in terms of burdens. After the masses' various concerns were eliminated, they all tried to add to the purchase of livestock. In the Seventh District, there were 3,840 head of livestock last winter, and by the end of June this year, there were 4,345 head, an increase of 505 head. In Taixing Village, First District, more than 20 new livestock were bought, and 13 good ones were exchanged. Now, the entire village of 250 households has an average of one head of livestock per household. Wu Yan and Huang Zhuang villages in the Seventh District worked hard on transportation this spring and bought 30 head of livestock with the money they earned. The county has increased its livestock by a total of 2,114 head in the past six months. Last year, each livestock in the county had to cultivate an average of 49 mu, 5 fen and 7 li of land. This year, it has been reduced to 33 mu, which is a considerable guarantee for intensive cultivation.\n　　[Another Dispatch] The Shiqiu Donkey Breeding Cooperative in Yicheng has bred 54 donkeys in the past six months. During the production conference held in the county last December, it was discovered that the shortage of livestock was a major difficulty in production in various places. According to calculations in the Second and Third Districts, if each livestock could cultivate 35 mu of land, there would be a shortage of 2,005 head of livestock. At that time, Manager Ma of the Cooperative Committee called on everyone to organize the masses to establish donkey breeding cooperatives and develop livestock breeding on a large scale. The democratic government stipulated that donkeys and those in charge of breeding could be exempted from labor service, and loans were provided to help. The cadres of Shiqiu returned to the village and studied with all the cadres, borrowed 210,000 yuan (Ji banknotes), bought a donkey, established a breeding cooperative, and welcomed everyone to join. More than four months have passed and 54 breeds have been bred, guaranteeing that 40 small donkeys can be born. The county government commended this cooperative.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳奖励多喂牲口　济源半年增畜两千余头\n\n1948-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳奖励多喂牲口\n  　济源半年增畜两千余头\n    【太岳电】太岳民主政府奖励与帮助群众增加牲畜，发展农村生产力。行署于六月一日颁布奖励喂牲口的办法，规定凡在本年出负担以前买上的牲口，出负担时扣除买价三分之一。并扣除畜料一部分。许多县份规定服勤牲口受到损失时，政府给以赔偿和治疗。政府又发放大批贷款，帮助农民购买与繁殖。不少村庄补偿了错斗中农的损失，他们开始购买牲口，安心经营。翼城二区下交村头一天补偿错斗中农的损失，第二天就有人买了三头牲口。高平庞村补偿中农损失后，中农吴继周说：“这可不害怕了，以后要好好闹生产哩！”马上去买了一条牛。绛县杨村谭人彦等在政府领了参战损失牲口的赔偿麦子后说：“这可不怕了，牲口支差出了岔子，政府还管赔呢！”立刻和别人合伙买了牲口。济源全县今年增加牲口两千多头，沁县增加一千多头。晋城只六区就增加了一百一十九头，高平一区七个村增加了二百二十头，浮山三区十六个村增加了二百十五头。现各地领导上又及时强调提出在互助组里变工，必须进行等价交换，克服过去片面的照顾没牲口户、不执行等价交换原则的错误。更鼓励了有牲口户安心喂养与繁殖。\n    【太岳讯】济源民主政府从各方面提倡群众多养牲口，半年来全县增加牲口两千多头。为了奖励牲口繁殖，在战勤上坚决执行配种公畜、怀胎母畜、二对牙小畜免勤的规定，并对服勤伤亡的给予赔偿和医药治疗，三月份政府支出医药费与赔偿费二百零七万（冀钞），因此解除了群众怕支差不愿多养牲口的顾虑。在今春发现牲口瘟疫后，立即召集了兽医座谈会，组织十个兽医下乡给牲口看病，使五百多个得病牲口免于死亡。在兽医中提倡多带徒弟的办法，发展业务。另外又召集了全县牲口配种能手座谈会，克服了一般人认为配种是“丑事”，轻视配种的错误看法，并奖励配种能手黄存凯一面锦旗。现全县已有四五个人专门经营这种业务，大大便利了牲口的繁殖。在互助生产运动中，县委与政府向各级干部反复强调“牲口互助，必须等价自愿”，克服了干部片面的“照顾没牲口户”的错误观点，逐渐解除了群众养牲口怕互助吃亏的顾虑。在负担上坚决执行政府所规定扣除买价的三分之一，奖励办法。群众的各种顾虑消除以后，都设法添买牲口。七区去冬有牲口三千八百四十头，迄今年六月底，已有四千三百四十五头，增加了五百零五头。一区太行村新买牲口二十多个，又换了十三个好的，现在全村二百五十户，已平均到每户有一头牲口。七区吴彦、黄庄两村，今春努力搞运输，用赚的钱买了牲口三十头。全县半年来共增加了牲口二千一百十四头。去年全县每个牲口平均要耕地四十九亩五分七。今年已减为三十三亩，相当的保证了精耕细作。\n    【又讯】翼城石丘牡驴配种合作社，半年来配种五十四个。去年十二月全县开生产会议时，各地发现牲口缺少是生产上的大困难。据二、三两区计算，如能作到每个牲口耕种三十五亩地，就短少二千零五头牲口。当时合作委员会马经理，号召大家组织群众成立牡驴配种合作社，大量配种发展牲口。民主政府规定牡驴和管配种的人可以免差，并予贷款帮助。石丘干部回村和全体干部研究，贷款二十一万元（冀钞），买了一个牡驴，成立配种合作社，并欢迎大家入股，四个多月已配了五十四个种，保证可下四十个小驴。县政府表扬了这个合作社。"

    "content": "Taihang Administrative Office Education Conference\n  　Corrects Blindly Shouting \"Vocationalization,\" Determines Future Focus on Improving Culture\n    [Taihang Electric] The Administrative Office here convened an education conference from June 26th to July 10th. Participants included principals of various secondary schools, education section chiefs of various special districts, etc. The conference first criticized and liquidated the guerrilla habits and impractical, blindly shouted \"vocationalization\" policy that had been developed in education work for many years, emphasizing production, political classes, and integration with central work, even proposing absurd theories that teachers do not need to be literate, as long as their class background is good; students do not need to attend classes, as long as they can labor, no classes, no learning, etc., fundamentally ignoring basic cultural education. For example, Yu Bei Middle School only had eight months of cultural classes in three years, resulting in students not improving their culture and not mastering technology. Therefore, employment is difficult. Based on the abnormal, ununified, and free-flowing state of school education, it was clearly stipulated that the future education policy is to implement a new democratic regular education, focusing on improving cultural level and cultivating various construction talents. In specific practices, it is stipulated that: (1) In terms of cultivation viewpoints, it must be for today's needs (employment) and also for future preparation (advanced studies). (2) Rapidly restore and rectify primary school education, and then move towards regular construction. (3) Combine theory with practice, focusing on learning and combining with practice, focusing on schools and combining with society. The purpose of combining is to enrich learning. (4) Implement new democratic ideological education in various subjects and school life. The nature, tasks, and years of various levels of different schools have been specifically studied. Secondly, the conference examined and criticized all organizational forms and methods of transferring rural class struggle to schools, as well as the so-called slogans of \"culture returning to agriculture\" and \"filling in gaps,\" and the childish behavior of investigating class, ideology, and work style among seven or eight-year-old primary school students. For teachers and students who were squeezed out during the past investigation of class and squeezing out of feudalism, it was determined that as long as there is no evidence of being a traitor or having serious crimes of sabotage in the land reform, they should all be mobilized to resume their positions and studies on the principle of voluntariness, continue education and transformation, so that they can serve the people. For existing teachers, regardless of new or old, they will all be universally screened once according to the following four conditions: cultural level, career spirit, mass relations, and political thought. Those who are qualified will be retained, otherwise they will be advised to change careers or sent to school for study and training. The so-called political thought is also limited to not opposing the democratic government, and cannot demand too much. In addition, in order to strengthen school leadership, it was determined that middle schools belong to the Administrative Office, simple normal schools belong to the Special District, and senior primary schools belong to the county; and it is stipulated that students shall not be arbitrarily appointed or transferred before the graduation year without the approval of the higher authorities, so as to ensure regular learning.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行行署教育会议　纠正盲目喊叫“职业化”确定今后提高文化为主\n\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行行署教育会议\n  　纠正盲目喊叫“职业化”确定今后提高文化为主\n    【太行电】此间行署于六月二十六日至本月十日召开教育会议。参加者有各中等学校校长，各专署教育科长等。会议首先批判与清算了教育工作上多年来所养成的游击习气与不切合实际的盲目喊叫的“职业化”方针，强调生产，政治课，及与中心工作结合，甚至提出教员不必识字，只要成份好就行；学生不必上课，能劳动就好，不要班次不要学习等荒唐理论，根本忽视了基本的文化教育。如豫北中学三年内只上了八个月文化课，结果学生文化没提高，技术未学通。因而就业困难。根据学校教育上不正常，不统一和自流状态，明确规定今后的教育方针是实行新民主主义的正规教育，以提高文化水平为主，培养各种建设人材。在具体作法上规定：（一）在培养观点上，必须是为今天需要（就业），也为将来作准备（深造）。（二）迅速恢复与整顿小学教育，然后走向正规建设。（三）理论与实际结合、以学习为主结合实际，以学校为主结合社会。结合目的是充实学习。（四）在各种学课与学校生活中贯彻新民主主义的思想教育。对各级不同学校的性质、任务与年限，都具体作了研究。其次，检查与批判了学校中搬运农村阶级斗争的一切组织形式与方法，以及所谓“文化还农”、“填平补齐”的口号、在七八岁小学生中查阶级查思想查作风的儿戏行为。对过去查阶级、挤封建时被挤走的教职员与学生，确定只要不是奸特有据，或有严重的破坏土改罪行者，在其自愿原则下，一律动员复职复学，继续教育改造，使其为人民服务。对现有教员，不论新旧，一律以下列四个条件普遍甄别一次；文化水平，事业精神，群众关系，政治思想。合格者留任，否则劝其转业，或送学校学习培养。所谓政治思想亦只限于不反对民主政府即可，而不能要求过高。另外为加强学校领导，确定中级学校归行署，简师归专署，高小归县；并规定不到毕业年限，不经上级批准，不得随意任用与调动学生，以保证正规学习。"

On the 5th, it ordered all subordinate regional offices to organize forces, collect materials, and first formulate a plan for the region based on the situation. The order stated: \"Based on the CCP Central Committee's 1948 instructions on land reform and party consolidation work, the People's Daily inaugural editorial, and the actual situation in our region, fully restoring and developing production has become the central task for our region in the future. To ensure the realization of this task, it is necessary to formulate a relatively precise, scientific, and long-term production and construction plan as a basis for guiding future work and as a goal to strive for. Now, to make the plan precise, each commissioner must be responsible for organizing a certain force, specifically responsible for convening various forums, collecting and researching materials, supervising and inspecting, and submitting them to the Administrative Office before August 24th. They must also propose opinions on the construction plan based on local conditions. The focus of the collected information includes two major parts: agriculture and industry. The agricultural part includes forests, water conservancy, animal husbandry, transportation, special products, cooperation, household sideline occupations (including textiles), historical conditions, and future construction conditions, etc. The industrial part includes the coal industry, iron industry, porcelain industry, bamboo industry, tool manufacturing industry (iron and wood factories, tool factories), stationery manufacturing industry (pens, ink, slates, slate pencils, chalk, ink, etc.), paper making industry (including Qinyang straw paper), cotton textile industry (including knitting industry), silk weaving industry, wool weaving industry, chemical industry, soap, tooth powder, tanned leather industry, straw hat braiding, saltpeter and sulfur industry, medicine manufacturing, and soil pigment improvement. It is encouraged to study the historical development and current production and management situation, as well as policy implementation. Regarding the production situation, it is necessary to understand the distribution area and production volume, the source of raw materials, the size of capital, the number of workers, technical conditions, the sales area and sales volume, the organizational form of production and sales, and their advantages and disadvantages. Regarding policy implementation, the situation of wrong struggles and correction of deviations, wage and burden policies, the relationship between public and private economies, the relationship between industry and agriculture, what ideological obstacles and production requirements exist between cadres and the masses, workers and capitalists, the economic relationship between the government and trade unions and cooperatives, the division of industrial and commercial areas, and what favorable and unfavorable conditions exist in the future.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 恢复与发展生产　太行行署令各专区制订三年建设计划\n\n1948-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　恢复与发展生产\n  　太行行署令各专区制订三年建设计划\n    【太行电】太行行署为恢复与发展生产，制订全区三年（一九四九至一九五一）建设计划，特于五日命令所属各专署，组织力量，搜集材料，先根据情况订出专区的计划。命令称：根据中共中央一九四八年土改整党工作指示，人民日报创刊号社论及本区实际情况，全力恢复发展生产，已成为本区今后中心任务。为保证这一任务实现，就必须订定一个较精确科学的较长期的生产建设计划，以作为今后工作指导的依据与奋斗目标。现为使计划精确，各专员必须负责组织一定力量，专门负责召开各种座谈会，搜集研究材料，督促检查，于八月二十四日前送达行署。并根据当地情况，提出建设计划的意见。搜集的重点，包括农业、工业两大部分。农业部分，包括森林、水利、牧畜、交通、特产、合作、家庭副业（纺织在内）及历史情况与今后建设条件等。工业部分，包括煤业、铁业、磁业、竹业、工具制造业（铁木工厂、工具厂），文具制造业（笔、墨、石板、石笔、粉笔、墨水等）、造纸业（包括沁阳草纸）、棉织业（包括针织业）、丝织业、毛织业、化学工业、肥皂、牙粉，熟皮制革业、草帽辫、硝磺业，药品制造与土颜料改良。提倡研究历史发展情况与目前生产经营情况，及政策执行情况。在生产情况方面，要了解其生产分布区域及生产量、原料来源、资本大小、工人多少、技术条件、行销区及销售量、生产与推销组织形式，及其优缺点。在政策执行方面，错斗与纠偏执行情况，工资、负担政策，公私经济关系，工农业关系，干部与群众、工人与资本家存在什么思想阻碍与生产要求，政府与职工会、合作社经济关系，工商业区域划分，今后存在那些有利与不利条件等。"

    "content": "Taiyue Telegram: Nanyicheng Village in the Second District of Jincheng, corrected the past deviation of relying solely on mutual aid teams to bear the task of substitute farming, achieving a rational burden for the entire village. The village has 169 households, with 53 military family households. In the past, regardless of whether the military family members had labor power or how much land they owned, they were all required to have substitute farming done by mutual aid teams, and those who did not participate in the mutual aid teams were not responsible. This placed the task of substitute farming on a small number of people, and the masses said, \"The light ones are too light, and the heavy ones are too heavy!\" Because there were few people doing substitute farming, the land was not well cultivated. The military families were also dissatisfied, saying, \"Further preferential treatment will exhaust us.\" Recently, during the rectification of mutual aid, according to the opinions of the masses, the past method was changed, and fair and reasonable substitute farming methods were stipulated. First, all 137 full and semi-laborers in the village who were capable of production were registered, and substitute farming duties were assigned according to each person's labor situation. At the same time, military families were persuaded and mobilized to produce for self-sufficiency, instead of waiting for preferential treatment. It was stipulated that families with one full laborer would not receive preferential treatment, and families with half a laborer would receive half the preferential treatment. In this way, 28 out of the 53 households were exempted from preferential treatment. The number of households requiring substitute farming was reduced by one-half, but the number of people doing substitute farming increased by two times compared to the past. The specific substitute farming methods stipulated were: (1) For military families who should receive preferential treatment, families with one person will have three mu of land substitute-farmed, two people will have five mu, three people will have six mu, and four people will have seven mu, adopting a progressive reduction method to provide basic guarantees for the lives of lonely, widowed, and powerless military families. (2) Each mu of land is given substitute farming with eight man-days and two and a half animal-days, and preferential treatment tickets are issued to military families. If the labor exceeds this amount, the military families pay wages to the mutual aid teams. If less labor is used due to their own labor, the village compensates with wages to encourage military families to be self-reliant and engage in production. (3) General military families use preferential labor, provide meals but do not pay wages, while poor military families do not provide meals. Animal-power substitute farming provides fodder for the military families' livestock. After this method was implemented, each of the 124 laborers in the village only had to bear five workdays per year; and each of the 49 livestock only had to bear four workdays. The masses all said, \"With so few workdays per person, we must do a good job for them even if we don't get meals.\" The military families were also very satisfied. Li Detu was allocated 42 preferential workdays this time, but her two daughters-in-law exchanged work with others, cultivated the land completely well, and did not use preferential treatment tickets.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 扩大代耕面组织军属生产　南义城合理代耕\n\n1948-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　扩大代耕面组织军属生产\n  　南义城合理代耕\n    【太岳电】晋城二区南义城村，改正过去单靠互助组负担代耕任务的偏向，做到全村合理负担。全村有一百六十九户，有五十三户军属，过去不管军属有无劳力和土地多少，一律叫互助组代耕，不参加互助组的就不负担。把代耕任务放在少数人身上，群众说：“轻的轻死了，重的重死了！”因为代耕的人少，代耕的地也种不好。军属也不满的说：“再优待就把俺优待干了。”最近整顿互助时，根据群众意见，改变了过去的办法，规定了公平合理的代耕办法。先把全村能生产的一百三十七个全半劳力登记起来，按各人劳力情形分担代耕勤务，同时说服与发动军属生产自给，不要坐等优待。规定家有一个全劳力的就不优待，有半个劳力的优待一半。这样五十三户中有二十八户免去了优待。需代耕的户数减少了二分之一，代耕人数却比过去增加了二倍。具体代耕办法，规定：（一）应优待的军属，家有一口人的给代耕三亩，两口人的代耕五亩，三口者六亩，四口者七亩，采取累进递减办法，使孤寡无力军属，生活上有了基本保证。（二）每亩地按八个人工两个半畜工给以代耕，发给军属优待票。超过的工，军属给互助组出工资，因自己劳动而少用了工，村中补给工资，以鼓励军属自力更生，进行生产。（三）一般军属使用优待工，管饭不出工资，贫苦军属不管饭。畜力代耕军属畜料。这办法实行以后，全村一百二十四个劳力，每人全年只负担五个工；四十九个牲口，每个负担四个工。群众都说：“每人这么几个工，不管饭也要给人家做好”。军属们也很满意，李德土这次分了四十二个优待工，但她两个媳妇和别人换工，把地完全种好，没有用优待票。"

It helped the entire village earn enough to acquire three 46-yarn spinning machines, wind bow frames, two iron weaving machines, two towel machines, one sock machine, and 35 spinning wheels, resolving the difficulties of many poor households and earning the support of the entire village. During the land reform last year, the widespread practice of \"moving stones\" caused the cooperative's cadres to cease their work. Last year's severe drought resulted in crop failure in the village, and this year, 103 out of the village's 976 people went hungry. Poor households repeatedly requested the restoration of the cooperative, but the cooperative cadres were concerned about \"moving stones\" and did not dare to lead. Seeing this situation, the village branch immediately led a Party group meeting to resolve the issue. Both past and present Party cadres made self-criticisms. The branch leadership first criticized the \"moving stones\" that had occurred in the village in the past, admitting that some were done incorrectly, and apologized to the comrades who had been wronged, hoping they would continue to work well. The Party cadres of the cooperative also criticized their own shortcomings, clarifying right and wrong. Once the problem was resolved, everyone's spirits lifted, and the cooperative was restored. They began by organizing 17 people to spin yarn, producing 70 jin in a month, earning a profit of 1.68 million yuan (border region currency, same below). At the same time, they wove 11 bolts of cloth and two dozen towels. The cooperative also organized two households that raised donkeys to engage in transportation and sales, earning 120,000 yuan per day. To expand weaving, they organized two carpenters to make spinning wheels, already earning 660,000 yuan.

This is mainly manifested in the village cadres' passive unwillingness to act and certain phenomena of extreme democratization. The management of substitute farming for military dependents is not good; it is not regular or there is no one to manage it, resulting in the cultivation of military dependents' land being rough and not timely, with very little fertilization, or even no fertilizer available. If we do not overcome these shortcomings immediately, the yield of military dependents' land this year will inevitably be reduced, which will not only be a great loss to production, but also extremely detrimental to solving the livelihood of military dependents and stabilizing the morale of the soldiers at the front. Therefore, we require leading cadres at all levels to conduct in-depth self-criticism and immediately carry out the following tasks:\n\n    1. Strengthen the leadership of military dependents' production work, and specifically organize all possible labor forces of military dependents to fully invest in the production front. If it is still insufficient and they are unable to hire people to cultivate, good substitute farming should be provided. The production problems of poor military dependents who need loans should be solved first, under the same conditions as ordinary farmers, and attention should be paid to organizing semi-able-bodied military dependents to engage in sideline production to increase their income.\n\n    2. In order to ensure that the yield of military dependents' land is not lower than the production level of ordinary farmers in the area, all localities should immediately use various methods to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer for military dependents. For land where autumn crops have been planted but fertilization is too little or has not been applied, topdressing should be applied immediately, and fertilizer should be stored to solve the needs for wheat planting after autumn.\n\n    3. Introduce and exchange experiences in organizing military dependents' production and substitute farming. Each region should, in a planned and focused manner, collect and study methods for organizing military dependents' production and solving substitute farming problems in their own region, and conduct preliminary research and analysis (explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each method, which types of regions or villages are suitable, and suggestions for improvement, etc.). Introduce them to each village for reference and adoption. This material (especially the methods for substitute farming problems) must be sorted out and reported to the government for research, introduction, and promotion.\n\n    Leading cadres at all levels must attach importance to this work in ideological leadership, solve the difficulties in military dependents' production from various aspects, and increase the income of military dependents so that the lives of military dependents in rural areas can reach the living standards of ordinary farmers in the area. This is one of the important contents of our this year's great production movement, implementing the policy of preferential treatment for military personnel, and consolidating the support of the troops for the war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府  晋察冀边区行政委员会联合指示　加强对军属代耕并组织军属生产\n\n1948-07-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府\n    晋察冀边区行政委员会联合指示\n  　加强对军属代耕并组织军属生产\n    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府暨晋察冀边区行政委员会于十六日联合指示各级政府：“加强对军属的代耕与组织军属生产工作”，内称：\n    据各地材料反映，目前对军属代耕与组织军属生产工作上，虽有个别地区或村庄作得较好，但普遍的说来是很差的，这主要的是表现在村干部的消极不敢做与某些极端民主化现象。对军属代耕管理不好，不经常或无人管理，以致使军属的土地耕作，粗糙不及时、施肥量很少，甚至无肥可施。这些缺点我们如不马上克服，今年军属土地的产量势必减收，不但对生产是一个很大的损失，而且对于解决军属生活安定前方战士情绪，也有极大的不利，因此要求各级领导干部应深刻检讨，并立即进行下列几项工作：\n    一、加强军属生产工作的领导，具体组织军属可能组织的劳动力完全投入生产战线上去。如仍不足而又无力雇人耕种的，应很好的给予代耕。贫苦军属之需要贷款者，在与一般农民同样条件下，应注意先解决军属的生产问题，并注意组织军属半劳动力搞副业生产，增加其收入。\n    二、为保证军属土地产量不低于当地一般农民的产量水平，各地应即利用各种办法，解决军属肥料不足问题。对已种的秋禾施肥太少或没有施肥的土地，应立即施用追肥，并应开始储备肥料以解决秋后种麦所需问题。\n    三、介绍交流组织军属生产及代耕经验，各地区应有计划有重点的搜集研究本地区组织军属生产、解决军属代耕问题的办法，加以初步的研究分析（说明每一种办法的优点和缺点，各适合于那一类的地区或村庄改进意见等），介绍各村参考采用，此项材料（特别是代耕问题的办法）并须整理后汇报本府，以便研究介绍推广。\n    各级领导干部必须在思想领导上，重视这一工作，从多方面的解决军属生产中的困难，增加军属的收入，使农村的军属生活能够达到当地一般农民的生活水平，这是我们今年结合大生产运动，贯彻优军政策，巩固部队支援战争的重要内容之一。"

    "content": "Beiyue News: The Beijiao Village Cooperative in Liangxiang was organized in March of last year with a share capital of one million yuan (border currency). It sold oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, paper, soap, grain, and other items, only able to supply the masses with some daily necessities. After the autumn of last year, due to the enemy's blockade, a large number of walnuts and apricot kernels in the village could not be sold, and the autumn harvest was poor, making life very difficult for the masses. The cooperative then changed its business policy, buying a large quantity of walnuts and apricot kernels to extract oil. Many women participated in labor such as cracking kernels and grinding. The masses' accumulated 30 shi (one dou is 20 jin) of apricot kernels and 200,000 walnuts were sold. Selling oil externally earned a transportation fee of 1.42 million yuan, and women earned wages of 5.42 million yuan. The masses' living difficulties were solved, and the cooperative also earned more than 8 million yuan. In winter, the cooperative organized more than 60 women to carry out spinning, receiving one jin of cotton to deliver half a jin of yarn (earnings could be exchanged for grain). A total of 300 jin of yarn was spun in winter, solving the living problems of many people and also supplying some cloth to the village. This spring, the masses were very short of grain. The cooperative bought 5,000 jin of grain from Zhangfang and organized the masses to transport grain, earning transportation fees. Two iron furnaces were organized to make farm tools, and the cooperative was responsible for selling them externally. A loan of more than 200 jin of grain was also provided to support seven people, including Wei Yongliang, to make shoe nails, earning an average of 70 jin of rice per day, which solved the living problems of 34 people in seven households, including Wei. Organizing the masses to weave baskets, make hemp ropes, and make military shoes also earned a lot of money. In the process of organizing mass production, the cooperative itself has earned 22.16 million yuan from last winter to now, equivalent to 9,634 jin of rice. The reason why the cooperative has achieved these results is mainly because the village and cooperative cadres are actively responsible, thinking of ways to solve the difficulties of the masses according to their needs, and thus winning the support of the masses. The cooperative can actively contact stores and develop with the support of the stores. For goods needed by the masses, the cooperative can directly wholesale from the stores at a lower price, and the fruits and handicrafts that the cooperative needs to sell are all handed over to the stores for consignment sales.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Beiyue Agricultural and Forestry Department)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 根据群众需要经营　北窖合作社得到拥护\n\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　根据群众需要经营\n  　北窖合作社得到拥护\n    【北岳讯】良乡北窖村合作社，从去年三月间组织起来，当时有股金一百万元（边币，下同），售卖油、盐、酱、醋、纸张、肥皂、食粮等物。只能供给群众一些日常用品。去年秋后，由于敌人的封锁，村中大批核桃、杏核销不出去，加上秋田歉收，群众生活非常困难。合作社于是改变了业务方针，大量收买核桃、杏核熬油。不少妇女参加了砸瓤子，推碾等劳动。群众积存的杏核三十石（每斗廿斤），核桃廿万个都有了销路，向外卖油时还赚了运输脚价一百四十二万元，妇女得工资五百四十二万元。群众生活困难解决了，合作社也赚洋八百余万元。冬季，该社又组织妇女六十余人开展纺织，领花一斤交线半斤（赚头愿换粮食也行），总计冬季纺线三百斤，解决了很多人的生活问题，也供给了村中一部分布匹。今春群众缺粮很多，合作社从张坊买到粮食五千斤，组织群众盘粮赚脚。组织铁炉二盘打制农具，由合作社负责向外出售。又贷粮二百余斤，扶助隗永亮等七人打鞋钉，平均每天可赚米七十斤，使隗等七户三十四口人生活问题获得解决。组织群众编筐打麻绳、做军鞋，也赚了不少钱。在组织群众生产的过程中，合作社本身从去冬到现在，也赚了二千二百一十六万元，折米九千六百三十四斤。该社取得这些成绩的原因，主要是由于村社干部积极负责，根据群众需要多想办法，解决群众困难，因而取得群众拥护。该社能主动与商店联系，并在商店扶植下得到发展。凡群众需要的货物，合作社可以直接向商店去批，价钱较贱，合作社需要推销的果子、手工业产品等，也全部交给商店代销。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（北岳农林厅）"

The focus of the loan is to support small-scale cooperative operations, small handicraft industrialists, and poor citizens engaged in production. In the past three months, it has played a certain role in supporting mass production, but there are also some problems that need to be improved urgently: (1) Some loan households (especially poor citizens and small handicraft industrialists) are unable to use loans to develop production well due to poor management and lack of guidance, resulting in losses. (2) Due to the cooperative's failure to tightly control the collection work, some loan households failed to pay on time during price increases, hoarding goods, which slowed down the cooperative's capital turnover. A few people profited from speculation, and most people wanted to borrow but could not. (3) Due to poor understanding of the situation, the objects were not well examined when issuing loans. Ma Guangtian (from Xingtai) of 14th Street borrowed 400,000 and ran away. The cooperative studied the above problems and decided on the following solutions: (1) It is necessary to clarify the policy, conduct in-depth investigations, distinguish objects, grasp key points, and oppose the gracious view of responding to all requests and the bureaucratic role of being aloof. (2) Help loan households make plans, specifically organize and guide production. (3) The street government and the Promotion Cooperative should be closely integrated, establish a certain leadership and organizational mass production meeting system, facilitate the grasping of the situation, exchange experience, and overcome certain disconnections in the past.\n\n　　Workers of Factory 320 Contract Construction and Save Expenses\n    △ When Factory 320 was building an important project, the workers of the factory automatically contracted it. After careful calculation, the project was completed ahead of schedule, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of the working class. Before the start of work, the foremen were gathered to study in detail, make plans, and properly arrange the required tools and raw materials. Then, the construction was carried out with specific division of labor. In the work, opinions of the masses were constantly absorbed, and inappropriate parts of the original plan were revised. As a result, the project was completed ahead of schedule. If the project were contracted out, it would cost tens of millions of yuan. Now that the workers have contracted it themselves, it only cost 3,624,000 yuan, greatly saving public expenditure.\n\n　　An Fengqing Rewarded 200,000 Yuan for Transforming Knife Grinding Factory\n    △ An Fengqing, a bed washing worker at Factory 306, has been dedicated to research and has successfully used wind steel to transform a special washing knife, which has been successfully tested. When the factory was making a pulp filter, it lacked very thin washing knives. Methods such as using surface strips to make washing knives had been tried successively, but all failed. Now, because An Fengqing's transformation of a special washing knife was successful, twelve pulp filters were quickly made. The factory awarded him 200,000 border currency to commend this important creation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石家庄零讯\n\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石家庄零讯\n  　石市二区推进社改进贷款工作\n    △石市二区生产推进社，近三月来发放信用贷款八亿二千九百一十四万余元，扶植一千七百八十六户从事各种生产。贷款重点为扶植小型合作经营、小手工业者及贫苦市民从事生产。三个月来，在扶植群众生产上曾起了一定作用，但也有一些问题急待改进：（一）有些贷款户（特别是贫苦市民与小手工业者）因不善经营，又缺乏指导，不能很好使用贷款发展生产，以至亏了本。（二）由于该社收款工作掌握不紧，在物价上涨时，部分贷款户到期不交，囤积货物，使该社资金周转慢，少数人投机得利，多数人想贷款贷不到。（三）由于对情况了解差，在发放贷款时，未能很好审查对象，十四街马光田（邢台人）贷到四十万逃跑了。该社研究了以上的问题，决定如下克服办法：（１）必须明确方针，深入调查，区别对象，掌握重点，反对有求必应的恩赐观点及高高在上的官僚作用。（２）帮助贷款户作计划，具体组织和指导生产。（３）街政府与推进社应紧密结合，建立一定的领导与组织群众生产的会议制度，便利掌握情况，交流经验，克服过去某些脱节现象。\n    三二○厂工人承包建筑节约开支\n    △三二○厂在建筑某重要工程时，由该厂工人自动承包，经过精密计算，工程提早完成，充分表现出工人阶级的积极性。开工前，先召集各领班详细研究，作出计划，并将所需工具原料妥贴安排。接着就具体分工进行建筑。工作中又不断吸收群众意见，修改原计划不合适的地方，结果工程提早完成。该工程如果包出去，需用数千万元，现由工人自包，合计只用三百六十二万四千元，大大节省了公家开支。\n    安凤清改造洗刀工厂特奖廿万元\n    △三○六厂洗床工人安凤清专心研究，利用风钢改造专用洗刀，已试用成功。该厂制作滤浆机时，缺乏很薄的洗刀，曾先后试用表条制作洗刀等办法，均未成功。现因安凤清改造专用洗刀成功，很快制成十二块滤浆机。工厂特奖他边币二十万元，表扬这一重要创造。"

Resolutions: (1) Send a telegram to the World Student Association to accuse the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs of their atrocities and to support the heroic Northeast students fighting in Beiping. (2) Expand propaganda. Starting from the 25th of this month, hold an exhibition of historical serial comics depicting the massacres of students by warlords and fascist bandits since the \"March 18th Incident\" at the People's Education Center. On the evening of the 17th, various units went to entertainment venues to conduct propaganda, and promotional cards were added to cinemas. The full text of the telegram is now disclosed as follows:\n    (1) Accusation by the educational circles and youths of Shijiazhuang City to the World Student Association regarding the \"July 5th\" Massacre.\n    World Student Association: Under the dual oppression of feudalism and imperialism, Chinese students have consistently fought, even at the cost of bloodshed and sacrifice, to realize a new China that is independent, peaceful, and democratic since the May Fourth Movement. Precisely because of this, every patriotic and democratic movement has paid a heavy price in hot blood. On July 5th, in Beiping, under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, students from the Northeast who had been threatened and deceived into coming to Beiping by Chiang Kai-shek, because they resisted Chiang Kai-shek's policy of oppression and starvation, and his plot to drive them to become cannon fodder for the Four Big Families' anti-people civil war, were subjected to a great massacre by the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs using American-made bullets to destroy humanity, resulting in over a hundred deaths and injuries and thirty-seven arrests, creating the largest massacre of students since the \"March 18th Incident\" in 1926. The educational circles and youths of Shijiazhuang City express boundless indignation at the July 5th bloodbath, have a clearer understanding of the ferocious face of Chiang Kai-shek, the historically great butcher and traitor, and vow to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, the great butcher and traitor, as an action to protest the bloodbath. We hope that all peace-loving, democratic, and just youths around the world will unite to oppose American imperialism's support of Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, and give just assistance to the students who died and the people who are fighting unyieldingly in the Chiang-controlled areas.\n    　　　　Shijiazhuang Middle School Teachers' Union Preparatory Committee\n    　　　　　　　　Elementary School Teachers' Union\n    　　　　　　　　Youth Preparatory Committee\n    (2) Letter of Condolence to Northeast Students in Beiping\n    Dear Northeast Students in Beiping:\n    First of all, we express our condolences with infinite grief to the students who were killed and extend our brotherly sympathy to those who were injured and are still imprisoned.\n    According to reports from various sources: those crazy bandits \"used good bullets and the speed of gunfire to pursue you,\" resulting in over a hundred deaths and injuries on the spot. Afterwards, they falsely accused you, who were unarmed, of being the \"violent thugs\" who opened fire first! We, and the people of the entire liberated area, will never believe such vile lies. Bloody experience has repeatedly told us: for twenty years, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has had no better treatment for patriotic students in China than deception, threats, beatings, massacres, and spewing blood and making rumors.\n    Dear Northeast students in Beiping, we all grow up on the same Chinese land, but we have different destinies: on one side is the reactionary rule of American imperialist aggressors and the Chiang bandit gang, and on the other side is the democratic and happy life of the people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This contrast becomes especially clear to us every time we hear that students in the Chiang-controlled areas are being persecuted again.\n    Today, although we cannot provide you with the loving material assistance that the students in Beiping and Tianjin can, given the inhuman treatment and urgent economic difficulties you are suffering in the Chiang-controlled areas, we will launch an effective support movement here, and telegraph the World Student Association to accuse the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs of their atrocities in massacring you with American-made bullets to all mankind. We must also step up production, work, and study to support the people's revolutionary war, in order to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit gangs as soon as possible and avenge you.\n    Dear Northeast students in Beiping, stand up even stronger! The destruction of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is not far away, and the realization of a new China is just around the corner. Democracy, freedom, and happiness ultimately belong to us, to all the Chinese people.\n    Finally, on behalf of all educational figures and youths in Shijiazhuang, we extend our highest respect to your heroic struggle against persecution and famine.\n    　　　　　　Shijiazhuang Middle School Teachers' Union Preparatory Committee\n    　　　　　　Shijiazhuang Elementary School Teachers' Union\n    　　　　　　Shijiazhuang City Youth Preparatory Committee\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　July 15th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石市教师暨青年　抗议“七五”惨案声援东北同学\n\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石市教师暨青年\n  　抗议“七五”惨案声援东北同学\n    【石家庄讯】十五日上午十时，石市青年筹委会，中学教联筹备会及小学教联等单位代表十七人，在女中举行座谈会，抗议蒋傅匪帮制造“七五惨案”的滔天罪行，声援北平东北受难同学。决议：（一）通电世界学联，控诉蒋傅匪帮的暴行，声援在平英勇奋斗的东北同学。（二）扩大宣传。自本月二十五日起，在民教馆举行自“三·一八”以来，军阀及法西斯匪徒屠杀学生的历史连环漫画展览。十七日晚各单位分赴各娱乐场所进行宣传，并在影院加放宣传卡片。现将通电原文披露如下：\n    （一）石家庄市教育界及各界青年为“七五”惨案给世界学联的控诉书。\n    世界学联：中国学生在封建、帝国主义的双重迫害下，从五四以来，始终不惜流血牺牲坚决为实现独立和平民主的新中国而奋斗。正因为如此，每次爱国民主运动莫不付出大量赤热的鲜血。七月五日在蒋介石匪帮统治下的北平，从东北被蒋介石威胁欺骗到平的学生，因为反抗蒋介石的压迫和饥饿政策和进而驱迫他们充当四大家族反人民内战的炮灰的阴谋，受到蒋傅匪帮用美制子弹毁灭人性的大屠杀，死伤百余人被捕三十七人，造成自一九二六年“三、一八事件”之后最大一次屠杀学生的惨案。石家庄教育界及各界青年对七五血案表示无比的愤慨，更清楚的认识了历史上大刽子手大卖国贼蒋介石的穷凶面目，而且誓以消灭大刽子手大卖国贼蒋介石作为抗议血案的行动，我们希望全世界爱好和平民主正义的青年，一致起来反对美帝扶日援蒋，给蒋区死难同学及坚强斗争不屈的人民以正义的援助。\n    　　　　石家庄市中学教联筹委会\n    　　　　　　　　小学教师联合会\n    　　　　　　　　青年筹委会\n    （二）致北平东北籍同学的慰问信\n    亲爱的北平东北籍的同学们：\n    首先，我们谨以无限的沉痛，对被难的同学表示悼念，并向受伤的，仍被禁闭的你们遥寄我们兄弟的慰意。\n    据各方报导：那些疯狂的匪徒们：“以上好子弹就开枪的速度追击你们，”当场死伤百余人。事后，反污蔑赤手空拳的你们为先开枪的“暴徒”！这种卑劣的谎言，我们，和全解放区的人民，是永远不会相信的。血的经验一再告诉我们：二十年来蒋介石匪帮对中国的爱国学生，除了欺骗，威胁毒打，屠杀和含血喷人的造谣外，是再没有其他更好的待遇了。\n    亲爱的北平东北籍同学们，我们都是生长在同一块中国的土地上，可是我们却有着不同的命运：一方面是美帝侵略者与蒋匪的反动统治，另一方面是中国共产党领导下人民大众民主幸福的生活。这一个对比，每当我们听到蒋管区同学们又一次被迫害时，就分外地看得明显了。\n    今天，你们在蒋管区所遭受到非人的待遇和迫切的经济困难，我们虽不能象平津同学那样给你们以友爱的物质援助，但我们将在这里展开有效的声援运动，并电告世界学联向全人类控诉蒋傅匪帮以美制子弹残杀你们的暴行。我们更要加紧生产、工作和学习，支援人民革命战争，以期早日消灭蒋傅匪帮为你们报仇雪恨。\n    亲爱的北平东北籍同学们，更坚强地站立起来吧！蒋介石匪帮的毁灭已为期不远，新中国的实现就在眼前。民主自由与幸福终归是属于我们，属于全中国人民的。\n    最后，我们谨代表全石家庄教育界人士及各界青年，对你们英勇的反迫害反饥饿斗争，谨致崇高的敬意。\n    　　　　　　石家庄中学教联筹备会\n    　　　　　　石家庄小学教联会\n    　　　　　　石家庄市青筹委会\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　七月十五日"

    "content": "Organizing Mass Production by Changing Wages to Dividends\n　　Guo Su Cooperative's Business Development\n\n　　[North Yue News] The Pingshan Guo Su Town People's Cooperative was established in March 1947. It was organized by Comrade Han Shaobai, the current head of the Industrial Section of the North Yue Fourth Special District Office, at the request of the masses. Initially, more than ninety shareholders voluntarily raised 2,687,000 yuan (border currency, same below). Later, with substantial investment and support from public stores and other sources, the capital grew to 44,940,000 yuan. Gradually, it developed to employ twenty-six workers and nine cadres and purchasing agents. The cooperative has agricultural tools, blacksmithing, felt-making, sheep-raising, ironware, and dyeing sections.\n\n　　The People's Cooperative has broken out of the circle of ordinary stores. In fourteen months, it manufactured 858 items such as single-wheeled carts, bellows, spinning wheels, and harrows; more than 4,200 pieces of ironware such as pot lids, hoes, sickles, iron shovels, kitchen knives, and weaving knives; felted 1,178 pieces of felt; and made 11,372.5 jin of hemp rope, but it still could not meet the demand. The masses are willing to \"patronize\" the People's Cooperative, mainly because the materials are good and the prices are low. The prices of the People's Cooperative are generally 10 to 20 percent lower than market prices. Purchasing raw materials from afar is naturally one of the reasons for the low prices; but without the business philosophy of Director Han Qingming, who said, \"We don't seek anything else, only to solve the difficulties of the masses,\" it would not be possible. The People's Cooperative not only produces itself, but also promotes household sideline production and organ production. The hemp rope section organized 18 households to spin hemp in batches of more than 5,400 jin, earning wages of 4,996,000 yuan. A portion of the shares were used to collect sheep, and a sheep-raising section was established. In fourteen months, the sheep fertilized 229 mu of land in nearby villages. The fertilization was free, only requiring feeding. Since its establishment, the cooperative's total turnover has been 618,930,000 yuan, with a total profit of more than 86,060,000 yuan, accounting for 13.8 percent of the turnover.\n\n　　The development of the People's Cooperative was not smooth sailing in the past nine or ten months. It went from failure to success. The key lies in \"changing the wage system to a dividend system.\" At the beginning of its establishment, the cooperative used a \"guaranteed wage\" system for workers. Skilled workers earned 100 to 120 jin of millet per month, and semi-skilled workers earned 70 jin. Food and clothing were provided by the cooperative. Although it was said at the time that \"if the cooperative earns more, there will be additional dividends,\" the workers lost confidence in the cooperative's ability to make money because they emphasized that the prices should be lower than those of private businesses. The \"guaranteed wage\" system actually became a \"wage system.\" The workers believed that the wages were the same whether they worked hard or not, so they were unwilling to work hard. It usually took eight workdays to make a single-wheeled cart, but they would take nine or even ten workdays. Some of the bellows made were completely immovable, and some could not be pushed back after being pulled out. Zhao Laozi of the agricultural tools section had better skills, but he complained that 120 jin of rice was too little, and he argued with the cooperative and made strange remarks: \"The cooperative is for the people, not for making money, so we'll just wait to work for nothing!\" He brought his wife and children to the cooperative, and they stayed for ten or twenty days at a time. The masses reflected: \"The price is not high, but the goods are not good.\" Therefore, the cooperative almost collapsed. Xu Tingzhang invested two shi of rice and wheat, and requested \"give me half in kind and be done with it.\" Based on the above situation, after joint research by the cooperative's cadres and Comrade Han Shaobai, they found that the reason for the workers' low morale was the guaranteed wage issue, and they immediately convened everyone for review and discussion. At the meeting, some said: \"Working like this, we can't even withstand one-third of the effort. We're watching and working, but we're not putting in the effort.\" Some said: \"We don't earn more by working harder, so there's no motivation.\" Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to change to a dividend system. All profits: skilled workers receive 40 percent (the dividend ratio between skilled and semi-skilled workers is two to one), and the remaining 60 percent is the total profit. Cadres are all on a supply system and are paid from the total profit. Another 15 percent of the total profit is allocated to the public welfare fund. In this way, everyone's morale was high. Only Zhao Kaozi still believed that \"selling too cheaply doesn't make money.\" Under his influence, four workers in the agricultural tools section voluntarily left the cooperative. However, through hard work, the number of workers slowly increased. A cart now only takes seven workdays; the materials that used to make three cart handles can now make four. Han Jiji of the blacksmithing section and Zhang Ruyi of the hemp rope section, as well as Jia Menghu and You Shangwu of the agricultural tools section, all voluntarily processed more when there was a lot of work. Han Jiji, the blacksmith, used to earn 100 jin of millet per month. In the second five-month period, he received a dividend of 996,100 yuan, which was equivalent to more than 660 jin of rice at that time. Zhang Ruyi of the hemp rope section received a dividend of 1,550,000 yuan in the third five-month period, equivalent to 620 jin of rice. The workers' incomes increased, and in addition, a study system was established (reading newspapers and learning to read for one hour every night). The cadres also took time to plant half a mu of vegetable garden, which improved the food. Everyone's morale was very high, and the four people who left the cooperative wanted to come back. Shu Shu said: \"We can work and understand national affairs, which is better than working for private individuals.\" The masses came to inquire whether they could invest shares. Currently, the agricultural tools section and the blacksmithing section of the cooperative are preparing to expand. Only the dyeing workshop was cancelled in the end because the technology was not strong, the masses were not satisfied, and there were already two or three dyeing workshops in the town.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(He Jianping)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 组织群众生产工资改为分红　郭苏合作社营业发展\n何建平\n1948-07-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　组织群众生产工资改为分红\n  　郭苏合作社营业发展\n    【北岳讯】平山郭苏镇人民合作社成立于一九四七年三月，是现任北岳四专署实业科长韩少白同志在群众要求下组织起来的。开始由九十多个股东自愿集资二百六十八万七千元（边币，下同），后经公营商店等大量投资扶植，资金发展到四千四百九十四万。逐渐发展工人二十六人，干部、采买等九人；合作社设有农具、铁匠、毡坊、养羊、铁货、染坊等股。\n    人民合作社跳出了一般商店性质的圈子。十四个月来，制造了单轮小车、风箱、纺车、耠子等八百五十八件；锅头、锄、镰、铁锹、菜刀、织布刀等铁货四千二百余件；赶毡一千一百七十八条；打麻绳一万一千三百七十二斤半，但仍供不应求。群众愿意“照顾”人民合作社，主要原因是材料好，价钱少。人民合作社的物价，一般低于市价百分之十至二十。采购原料走的远，自然是物价低的原因之一；但如果没有主任韩庆明所说：“不图别的，只为给群众解决困难”的经营方针，也不可能。人民合作社不但自己生产，还带动家庭副业与机关生产。麻绳股组织群众十八家纺麻批五千四百余斤，赚工资四百九十九万六千元。股金内集了一部分羊，设了养羊股，十四个月卧地，解决了附近村二百二十九亩地的肥料，卧地不要钱，只吃饭。该社成立以来，总营业额六亿一千八百九十三万元，共得红利八千六百零六万余，占营业额的百分之十三点八。\n    人民合作社的发展过去用九个、十个工作，并不是一帆风顺的，它是从挫败走上成功。关键在“改工资制为分红制”。该社成立之初，对工人是用“保证金”制。每月技术工人赚小米一百至一百二十斤，半技术工人七十斤，吃穿由社内供给，虽然当时也说“社里多赚了，另外还要分红”，但因当时强调了货价要比私人低，工人对社里赚钱便没了信心。“保证金”制实际上成了“工资制”。工人们认为干好干坏工资是一样多，因此不肯好好干。打一个单轮车，一般需要八个工，他们就得九个甚至十个工。做出的风箱，有的根本拉不动，有的拉出来又推不回去。农具股赵老子技术较好，但嫌一百二十斤米少，和社里闹意见、说怪话：“社里是为人民，不为赚钱，咱就等着白干吧！”把老婆孩子接到社里，一住就是一二十天。群众反映：“价钱不大，就是货不好。”因此该社几乎垮了台。许亭章入了两石米麦的股，要求“按实物给我一半完事”。根据以上情形，经社里干部与韩少白同志共同研究，找到了工人情绪不高的原因在保证金问题上，随即召集大家检讨研究。会上有的说：“这样做工三下也顶不住一下。看着也干哩，就是不使劲”。有的说：“多干不多赚，干着没有劲”。最后一致同意改为分红制。全部红利，技工分百分之四十（技工与半技工分红为二比一），其余百分之六十为总红利。干部均为供给制，从总红利中开支。另在总红利中抽百分之十五公益金。这样，大家情绪都高了。只有赵考子仍认为“卖贱了不赚钱”，在他影响下，农具股的四个工人自愿出了社。但经努力经营，工人就慢慢加多了，一辆小车，现在只用七个工；过去三辆车把的材料，现在能作四辆。铁匠股与麻绳股全体，农具股的贾猛虎、尤尚武，都在活多时自动加工。铁匠韩吉吉过去月赚小米百斤，第二期五个月分红九十九万六千一百元，当时折米六百六十多斤。麻绳股张如一第三期五个月分红一百五十五万，折米六百二十斤。工人们收入增多，再加上建立了学习制度（每晚读报、识字一小时），干部又抽暇种了半亩菜园地，改善了伙食，大家情绪很高，出社的四个人又想回来。书书说：“作了活又能明白国家大事，比给私人干强”。群众纷纷来询问是否吸收股金。现该社农具股、铁匠股都准备扩大。只有染坊因技术不强，群众不满意，同时本镇已有两三家染坊，所以最后取消了。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（何建平）"

They attacked activists, stopped branch activities, made veteran village cadres passive, forced middle peasants to borrow grain, and carried out indiscriminate confiscations, undermining the unity of the masses. Although the branch work, which had been suspended, was later restored, the relationship between the branch and the Poor Peasants League remained very poor. This time, Zhang Zhucheng (a Party member), the vice-chairman of the Poor Peasants League, returned from the county wheat procurement conference and conveyed the spirit of the wheat procurement at the branch committee meeting. The branch decided to convene a general meeting of Party members to mobilize. The Party members (especially the veteran cadres) mistakenly thought that this was the work of the Poor Peasants League and were very unhappy. When Li Hexian, the former village chief, received the meeting notice, he questioned the branch secretary: \"Who is this being assigned to? If it is assigned to the Party, we will do it; if it is assigned to the Poor Peasants League, we will not care.\" At the general meeting of Party members, some veteran cadres expressed unwillingness to cooperate with the new cadres, and even advocated separating into different groups to collect grain and see who had the higher prestige. In the end, the branch secretary and the vice-chairman of the Poor Peasants League insisted on the correct position: new and old cadres help each other, and the branch leads the Poor Peasants League to do it together. At that time, it was also decided that the branch and the Poor Peasants League would each send fifteen people to form a collection committee, and Party members would guarantee completion. In addition, it was decided to hire some impartial farmers to participate in the evaluation. Although the principles were determined in this way, there were still twists and turns in the implementation. First of all, the Poor Peasants League did not have enough prestige, so the chairman, Li Jifu (newly elected, non-Party member), only had one or two people attend the first meeting he convened. At this time, the branch patiently persuaded the Party members and the masses to fully support the Poor Peasants League to complete the collection work. As a result, the meeting was held, and it was decided to proceed in three steps: first, post preliminary notices based on the equal land distribution register to solicit opinions. Second, evaluation, passed by the village meeting. Third, enter collection. After the meeting, new and old cadres, branch members, and Poor Peasants League members were mixed and divided into three groups to start work. The propaganda team immediately broadcast the news to the entire village. The collection committee members worked very actively. The next day, land notices were posted on the street, detailing the name and output of each plot of land for each household, as well as how much wheat was planted, and who the neighbors were, so that comparisons could be made. The person writing in front of the notice registered the opinions of the households, and the village deputy was responsible for explaining to the masses. In this way, in two days, more than fifty households (accounting for a quarter of the total number of households in the village) submitted more than seventy opinions. The collection committee made an assessment based on these opinions and determined the households to be reduced or exempted, and then announced them to everyone for comments. During the discussion of who should be reduced or exempted, there were many disputes among the masses. In order to explain that the collection should take into account and reward intensive cultivation and more grain production, the collection committee specifically cited the example of Li Shuangxi to guide everyone; Li Shuangxi is twenty-two years old, and the four acres of land he cultivates has a rated yield of 1.2 shi (石) per mu (亩) according to the land quality, but he is very lazy, does not apply fertilizer, and does not fill in pits, so the actual yield is only 0.8 shi (石). In such a situation, the collection should be based on the normal yield, that is, the rated yield according to the land quality, rather than the actual yield. Everyone strongly agreed with this approach. Because the evaluation was relatively fair and reasonable, the masses in the entire village were extremely enthusiastic about paying grain.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    Editor's note: There are some problems with Xiaofeng Village's approach that need to be considered. First, wheat procurement is a part of the government's work and should be led by the village political committee. The branch and the Poor Peasants League should ensure fairness and reasonableness in self-reporting and public discussion, but they must not take over and replace the government, creating a situation where the Party and the government are not separated, and the government and the people are not separated, increasing the anarchy of village-level work. Second, according to the report, the village did not involve middle peasants in the leadership of wheat procurement, but simply relied on the Poor Peasants League to carry out wheat procurement. This cannot guarantee the implementation of a fair policy for the burden on middle peasants. As for the poor relationship between the village branch and the Poor Peasants League, the low prestige of the Poor Peasants League, etc., further investigation and research are still needed.

It pointed out: (1) The biggest ideological concerns of laborers at present are family production, revising class status, and distributing confiscated property. Districts and villages should be responsible for resolving these issues in a timely and appropriate manner, and assistance should be provided according to the specific difficulties of each family. Those lacking labor should be given help with farming. The number of workdays for helping each departing laborer's family should not exceed 20 workdays per month. (2) All noteworthy happy events resolved for the departing laborers by the village (such as rain after a severe drought, revision of class status, distribution of confiscated property, etc.) should be promptly communicated to the front lines through letters. Districts and counties should also maintain regular contact with the front lines to exchange information, encourage, and offer condolences. (3) Labor support for the front is a regular combat task. Leaders at the county and district levels must strengthen their war consciousness and treat this work with caution. Regular work on people's armed forces should be strengthened, grassroots organizations for laborers should be improved, regular political education should be enhanced, a spirit of long-distance expedition should be cultivated, and the task of supporting the front should be completed.

He himself answers this question as follows: \"It may or may not be possible. But all in all, the question is limited to the name and not its essence.\" Wrong, Comrade Varga! Whether there may be a new stage of imperialism is not a matter of name but one of the basic and major issues in the socialist Leninist-Stalinist revolutionary theory. This question is one that has long been thoroughly considered and has long been resolved. As for the theory of the decisive significance of the bourgeois state in capitalist economics, eliminating capitalist anarchy, the basis of planned capitalist economy, etc., it is essentially a restoration of the opportunist theory of \"organized capitalism.\"\n    　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n    Comrade Varga writes at the beginning of his book: \"Analyzing the political changes caused by the war is not the purpose of this book.\" He plans to explore political changes in another work. The debate correctly pointed out the error of this book's separation of economic issues from political issues. How serious errors can occur under this erroneous way of thinking! For example, Comrade Varga regards the establishment of New Democratic countries merely as political changes. In fact, this is not only political but should first of all be a major socio-economic change in the world capitalist structure, one of the most important events in the sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism.\n\n    The most important result of the First World War was the breaking of the unified imperialist front; the victory of the October Socialist Revolution enabled Russia to break away from the world capitalist system. One of the most important results of the Second World War, which defeated fascism, was the liberation of the countries of Central Europe and Southeastern Europe from the imperialist system.\n\n    Comrade Varga does not understand and does not correctly explain the significant socio-economic changes in these countries. When discussing the economy of the New Democratic countries, he believes that \"state capitalism is dominant,\" and he further writes: \"The emergence of this new type of economy (an economy that can no longer be called capitalism as understood in the old sense), no matter how important it is in these countries, and no matter how much significance it has, the proportion of these countries in the entire capitalist world economy is relatively small and has not fundamentally changed the general prospects of capitalist development.\" (Page 291) This is equivalent to him believing that the economies of these countries are capitalist (although no longer in the \"old sense\"), are a form of state capitalism, and are part of the overall capitalist economy. According to the author, the emergence of New Democratic countries is not of great significance for the future of capitalist development.\n\n    Obviously, these errors of Comrade Varga are not of a local nature. It is closely related to the author's incorrect assessment of the general crisis of capitalism and the balance of power between the two camps of capitalism and socialism—democracy and imperialism.\n\n    In reality, a new form of state—people's republic—has been created in the People's Democratic countries, where power belongs to the people, and the alliance of the working class and all working people, led by the working class, is the dominant force. The nationalization of large industries and banks implemented in these countries means the creation of state ownership by the whole people. These countries have liberated the masses from imperialist enslavement.\n\n    As a result of agricultural reforms, land belongs to the peasants, which eliminates the landlord class. The working people of the New Democratic countries have laid the foundation for the transition to socialist development.\n\n    Comrade Varga said during the debate: \"I admit that the wording 'state capitalism is dominant' on page 291 is incorrect.\" As mentioned above, this is not just an incorrect wording; the assessment of the general crisis of capitalism is also incorrect. During the debate, several speakers correctly criticized Comrade Varga's underestimation of the role played by planned economy in the New Democratic countries, his incorrect understanding of the significance of land reform, and his non-Marxist assessment of the processes occurring between the suzerain states and the colonies.\n    　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n    During the debate, everyone paid close attention to criticizing Comrade Varga's peculiar theory of the impoverishment of capitalist belligerent countries. Of course, the destruction of productive forces by war, the inability of tax revenues to cover war expenditures, and the reduction of national wealth (except for the United States, which became rich in the war), etc., are undeniable facts. As the criticism pointed out, Varga failed to treat this issue from a class analysis. Therefore, he failed to point out that in capitalist countries, the main burden of the war was shifted to the poor masses, while the bourgeoisie, especially certain classes, became rich because of the war. Therefore, it is strange that Comrade Varga believes that extending working hours and increasing labor intensity, etc., are a counter-trend to resist the process of national impoverishment. Comrade Varga's theory of impoverishment has other meanings. It is well known that in his book \"The Exhaustion of Economic Resources of Fascist Germany,\" it was pointed out that the process of Germany's impoverishment and the continuous consumption of its economic resources had in fact begun in 1941, which was primarily the reason for Germany's demise.\n\n    Although this obviously incorrect argument has been criticized in our publications, Comrade Varga stubbornly sticks to his views during the debate. In fact, the theory of universal impoverishment of capitalist belligerent countries cannot be equated with the law of uneven development of capitalism. Germany, in the period when it began to wage war against the Soviet Union and in 1942-1943, expanded its economic resources by plundering its enslaved European vassal states and exploiting the working class.\n\n    Hitler's Germany failed because the Soviet Union's military, political, and economic strength surpassed it. The Soviet army, commanded by the great Stalin, not only accelerated the economic depletion of Fascist Germany, but was also the cause and the fundamental force for destroying the enemy's economic foundation. Therefore, the theory of attempting to explain Germany's demise through \"impoverishment\" is not only weak and powerless but also laughable.\n\n    Comrade Varga divides the changes in the capitalist world economy during the war into two categories: temporary and long-term. Temporary changes will mainly determine the development of capitalism in the next ten years; long-term changes will only fully appear after the pre-war production level is fully reached, which, according to Comrade Varga, will take at least ten years. \"In the first period, the unevenness of economic development that occurred during the war will have a decisive impact on the capitalist economic process.\" In the second period, when the \"thorough\" changes in capitalism caused by the war fully appear, it will manifest itself as \"the intensification of the basic contradictions of capitalist society, the opposition between social production and individual ownership, and will first appear in the problem of realizing value, in other words, the market problem.\" (Page 12)\n\n    These views of Comrade Varga on the future of capitalist development completely incorrectly oppose and separate the law of uneven capitalist development from the basic contradictions of capitalism. In reality, they are taking place simultaneously.\n\n    The claim that the market problem will only occur ten years after the economic recovery of Europe is a serious error.\n\n    For example, the market problem became more serious in the United States after the end of the war. Capitalist monopolies are trying to maintain the foreign markets where they sold their products during the war, because the purchasing power of many countries has declined due to the war, and they are trying to obtain new markets. American monopoly capital is attempting to politically and economically enslave the countries it is expanding into. This is the purpose of the infamous Marshall-Truman Plan.\n\n    The market problem has become more acute as a result of the increasing impoverishment of the working class in capitalist countries after the war. Generally speaking, the growing crisis of overproduction in the United States, while also believing that the basic contradictions of capitalism will only fully occur ten years after the end of the war (as Comrade Varga has done), completely confuses the issue of the future of capitalist development.\n\n    During the debate, it was correctly pointed out that Comrade Varga made the mistake of neglecting the characteristics of the New Democratic countries on the issue of restoring the economies of European countries to pre-war levels after ten years. These countries have already deviated from the normal course of capitalism, and economic revival is proceeding at a high speed and will be basically completed by their own efforts.\n\n    Comrade Varga's views on the future of the class struggle have also been correctly criticized. He wrote in his book: \"The role of the state will be more important in the future than before the war. More or less participating in the management of state affairs will become the main content of the political struggle between the two basic classes of capitalist society—the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The increasing polarization of capitalist society, the division between the two basic opposing classes, will further increase the proportion of the proletariat.\" (Page 318)\n\n    These words sound very strange in modern times when all roads lead to communism. At the same time, when the socialist state of the Soviet Union has existed for thirty years, many European countries have established people's republics, and a higher form of state power has emerged than any democratic bourgeois republic, to say that the main content of the political struggle of the proletariat in capitalist society is to participate in the management of state affairs more or less! Marxists have always considered this limitation of the tasks of the proletariat to be a form of reformism.\n\n    The Second World War caused great changes in the capitalist system and in the balance of power between capitalism and socialism. The most important results of the Second World War were the defeat of Germany and Japan; the detachment of several European countries from the world capitalist system, the establishment of people's republics, and the laying of the foundation for the transition to socialism; the socialist state—the Soviet Union—achieved victory and grew stronger in the war, and two camps were formed—imperialism led by the United States and democracy led by the Soviet Union. The struggle between these two camps is taking place in an environment of increasing aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism, the weakening of imperialist forces, and the strengthening of socialist democratic forces.\n\n    Important changes have taken place in the balance of class forces within capitalist countries. For example, it can be clearly seen that the role of the Communist Party is increasing, and the leftward shift of the broad masses of working people is expanding. One of the important manifestations of the general crisis of capitalism is the upsurge of the colonial national liberation movement. Obviously, any analysis of capitalist economic changes that is detached from the above facts is destined to fail. Comrade Stalin's pointed out the essence of the general crisis of capitalism, the new balance of international forces between socialism and capitalism, is the only correct and truly scientific basis for understanding the changes in the capitalist economy after the Second World War.\n\n    The task of our economists is to deeply study the practical problems of Soviet economic life and capitalist economic life based on the Leninist-Stalinist doctrine, and to expose with Bolshevik partisanship those anti-Marxist-Leninist views that, unfortunately, are still prevalent in our economics.\n\n    There are enough cadres in the science of Soviet economics to complete the tasks facing the Party and the state.\n    (Originally published in Pravda, January 26, 1948) (To be continued)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 关于一个经济学问题的论战\n依·拉甫捷夫\n1948-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　关于一个经济学问题的论战\n    依·拉甫捷夫\n    关于帝国主义新阶段可能性的问题，瓦尔加说：“资本主义发展的新阶段问题尚未考虑成熟。”（？！）他自己答复这问题如下：“可能有，可能没有。但是总而言之，问题仅限于名称而非其本质。”不对，瓦尔加同志！是否可能有帝国主义新阶段的问题，不是名称问题而是社会主义列宁、斯大林革命理论中基本的主要的问题之一。这一问题乃是一个早已被考虑成熟，而且早经解决的了。至于谈到资本主义经济学中的资产阶级国家的决定意义，消除资本主义无政府状态、资本主义经济的计划性的基础等等理论，在本质上是复辟了的机会主义的“组织的资本主义”理论。\n    　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n    瓦尔加同志在书中的开头写道：“分析为战争所引起的政治上的变化并不是本书的目的。”他准备在另外的著作里探讨政治上的变化。论战时正确地指出了本书著作将经济问题脱离政治问题的错误。在这种错误的思想方法之下，会发生多么严重的错误！例如瓦尔加同志将新民主国家的成立仅当作政治上的变化。实际上这不仅是政治，而首先应当是世界资本主义构成中重大的社会经济变化，是资本主义总危机尖锐化中头等事件之一。\n    第一次世界大战的最重要的结果是统一的帝国主义战线的被冲破；十月社会主义革命的胜利使俄国脱离了世界资本主义的体系。击溃法西斯的第二次世界大战的最重要的结果之一，是中欧和南东欧各国从帝国主义体系的解放。\n    瓦尔加同志不了解，并且不正确的阐明这些国家的重大社会经济变化。他在论述新民主国家经济时，认为“国家资本主义占优势”，他更写道：“这种新型经济的出现（这种经济已不能称之为旧语意中被了解的那种资本主义），在这些国度中无论如何重要，也无论其具有多少重大的意义，在整个资本主义世界经济中，这些国家的比重比较不大，并且基本上尚未变更整个资本主义发展的一般前途。”（二九一页）这等于他认为这些国家的经济是资本主义的（虽然已不是“旧语义”），是国家资本主义的形式，是整个资本主义经济的构成部分。按照著者的意见，新民主国家的出现对于资本主义的发展前途并无重大意义。\n    显然，瓦尔加同志的这些错误并不是局部的性质。它与著者对资本主义总危机、资本主义与社会主义两个阵营——民主与帝国主义的力量对比之不正确估计密切相连。\n    实际上，在人民民主国家里创造了新的国家形态——人民的共和国，在那里政权属于民众，以工人阶级为首的人民各劳动阶级的联盟乃是主导的力量。在这些国家里所实行的大工业与银行的国有化，意味着创造了国家的全民的所有制。这些国家把群众从帝国主义的奴役下解放出来。\n    由于农业改革的结果，土地归于农民，这就消灭了地主阶级。新民主国家的勤劳人民奠定了过渡到社会主义发展的基础。\n    瓦尔加同志在论战时说：“我承认在二九一页里‘国家资本主义占优势’的用语不正确。”正如上述，这并不仅是用语的不正确；关于资本主义总危机的估计也不正确。争论时若干发言正确的批判了瓦尔加同志对于在新民主主义国家计划经济所起的作用的过低的评价，对于土地改革意义不正确的认识，以及对于宗主国与殖民地之间发生着的过程之非马克思主义的估计。\n    　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n    在论战中，大家很注意对瓦尔加同志的资本主义交战国家贫穷化的奇特的理论加以批判。当然战争使生产力破坏、岁入不足支应战争耗费、使国富减少（除去在战争中致富的美国）等等，皆是不容置辩的事实。正如批判所指摘，瓦尔加未从阶级分析上去对待这一问题。因此他未能指出在资本主义国家，战争的主要负担被转嫁给贫苦大众，同时资产阶级，特别是某些阶层却因战争致富。因此，瓦尔加同志认为延长工作时间，增加劳动强度等乃是抵抗国家贫穷化过程的一种反趋势之这一论点，便成为奇怪的事了。瓦尔加同志的贫穷化理论还另有其他意义。众所周知，在其所编纂的“法西斯德国经济资源的枯竭”一书里，曾指出德国贫穷化过程及其经济资源的不断的消耗，在事实上从一九四一年已经开始，这首先是德国破灭的原因。\n    虽然在我们的刊物中曾批判了这种显然不正确的论点，但瓦尔加同志在论战时却固执己见。实际，资本主义交战国家普遍贫穷化的理论与资本主义不平衡发展的法则是不能同日而语的。德国在开始对苏联作战及一九四二至一九四三的期间，曾用掠夺被其奴役的欧洲属国和剥削工人阶级的手段扩大了其经济资源。\n    希特勒德国是因为苏联的军事政治经济各方面的力量超越了他而失败。为伟大的斯大林所指挥的苏联军队，不但加速了法西斯德国的经济枯竭，而且又是破坏敌人经济基础的原因和基本力量。因此企图说明德国之败灭于“贫穷化”的理论，不但是贫乏无力而且是可笑的。\n    瓦尔加同志将战时资本主义世界经济的变化分为暂时的和长期的二类。暂时的变化将主要地决定今后十年间的资本主义的发展；长期的变化将在完全达到战前生产水平之后才能整个的出现，按照瓦尔加同志的意见，这至少须在十年以后。“在第一期，战时发生的经济发展的不平均性将对资本主义经济过程给以决定的影响。”在第二期，当战争所产生的资本主义的“彻底”的变化完全出现时，它就表现为“资本主义社会基本矛盾的尖锐化，社会的生产与个人的所有间的对立，并且首先出现于实现价值的问题，换句话说就是市场问题上面。”（一二页）\n    瓦尔加同志的这些关于资本主义发展前途的见解，完全不正确地把资本主义不平均发展法则和资本主义基本矛盾对立与分割起来。实际上它们是同时进行的。\n    市场问题在十年后欧洲经济恢复完成之后才能发生的主张，是严重的错误。\n    例如战争结束后市场问题在美国就更严重的发生了资本主义独占设法保持在战时销售其生产品的国外市场，因为战争，许多国家的购买力业已低下，并要设法获得新的市场。美国的独占资本企图在政治上经济上奴役其扩张对象的国家。这就是恶名昭著的马歇尔——杜鲁门计划的目的。\n    市场问题因战后资本主义国家日益增长着的工人阶级贫困的结果，更为尖锐化起来。一般地说明美国生产过剩危机的日益增大，同时又认为资本主义基本矛盾将在战争结束十年后才全部发生（正象瓦尔加同志所作的），这就是资本主义发展前途的问题完全混乱。\n    论战时正确地指出关于在经过十年后才能恢复欧洲诸国经济到战前水平问题上，瓦尔加同志犯了忽视了新民主国家特质的错误。这些国家业已逸出资本主义的常轨，经济复兴正以高度的速度进行并将基本上以自己的力量完成它。\n    瓦尔加同志关于阶级斗争前途的观点也受到正确的批判。他在书中写道：“国家的作用将来会比战前更为重要。或多或少的参加管理国家问题，将成为资本主义社会两基本阶级——资产阶级和无产阶级——间政治斗争的主要内容。资本主义社会两极分化的日益增剧，两个基本对立的阶级分裂，会更为增大无产阶级的比重。”（三一八页）\n    当一切道路走向共产主义时，这些话在现代听来是很奇怪的。同时，当苏联社会主义国家业已存在三十年，许多欧洲国家成立了人民的共和国，并出现了较之任何民主的资产阶级共和国更为高度形式的国家政权时，却说什么资本主义社会无产阶级政治斗争的主要内容是或多或少的参加管理国家！马克思主义者从来都认为这种对无产阶级任务的限制乃是一种改良主义。\n    第二次世界大战在资本主义体系上、在资本主义和社会主义力量对比上引起了很大的变化。第二次世界大战的最重要结果是德国与日本的败北；从世界资本主义体系里脱落了几个欧洲国家，成立了人民的共和国并奠定了过渡到社会主义的基础；社会主义国家——苏联——获得胜利并在战争中壮大起来，成立了两个阵营——以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联为首的民主国家。这两个阵营的斗争是在资本主义总危机的日益尖锐化，帝国主义力量的削弱和社会主义民主力量的加强的环境下进行者。\n    资本主义国家内部阶级力量的对比业已发生了重要的变化。例如明显的可以看出共产党的作用的增大、扩大劳动群众的左倾。资本主义总危机的重要表现之一就是殖民地民族解放运动的高潮。显然，一切资本主义经济变化的分析如果脱离上述事实便命定地要遭受失败。斯大林同志所指出的资本主义总危机的本质，社会主义和资本主义在国际间新的力量的对比，乃是了解第二次世界大战后资本主义经济变化的惟一正确的真正科学的基础。\n    我们经济学者的任务乃是根据列宁——斯大林的学说深入地研究苏联经济生活与资本主义经济生活的实际问题，用布尔塞维克的党性去揭发那些可惜尚流布于我们经济学中的敌对马列主义的观点。\n    苏联的经济学这一科学部门中，是有足够干部以完成摆在党和国家面前的任务的。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　（原文载一九四八、一、二六真理报）（续完）"

    "content": "【Jizhong Electric】A spokesperson for the Jizhong Military Region Command recently issued a stern warning regarding the criminal acts of the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs in breaching dikes and releasing water, inundating peaceful residents in the Jizhong Liberated Area. The spokesperson stated: Since the beginning of spring, in the wake of disastrous defeats, the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs have continuously breached dikes on the Grand Canal, Daqing River, and Ziya River, releasing water to harm peaceful residents in the Liberated Area. On February 8th this year, Jiang's bandits breached the Grand Canal dike south of Wangjiaying Village, north of Jinghai City. The democratic government fully led the people in rushing to plug the breach, but due to continuous sabotage by Jiang's bandits, it has not been plugged to this day. On March 4th, Jiang's bandits dug several breaches, five zhang wide and eight chi deep, near villages such as Lijiawanzi, Erbao, and Sanbao on the banks of the Ziya River, plotting to inundate over eighty villages in the Jiakouwa area (this area is located south of Duliu, east of the Ziya River, west of the Grand Canal, and north of Zhouzhuangzi and Jiakou in Jinghai). Our democratic government and the People's Liberation Army led and assisted the people in rushing to plug the breaches day and night, finally plugging the breaches in Erbao, Sanbao, and other villages. The breach in Lijiawanzi has not been properly plugged to this day due to constant obstruction by Jiang's bandits. In February of this year, the Jiang and Fu bandits built two water barriers on the Daqing River north of Taitou Village, causing the river water to flow backward, flooding and destroying three thousand qing of wheat fields in Taitou and Huangcha. On April 3rd, Jiang's bandits breached the dike of the Ge Dian (separating the river from a depression) in three locations between @li (south bank of the Daqing River) and Tongshigou (north bank of the Daqing River). In early February, Jiang's bandits breached the Shuishui River mouth in Wen'anwa (this river mouth belongs to Jinghai and was built by the democratic government in 1945; it can divert water from Wen'anwa into the Ziya River). The democratic government led the local people in rushing to repair it three times, but all were sabotaged by Jiang's bandits. As a result, the water in Wen'anwa rose sharply, most of the spring wheat was flooded, and 210,000 mu of land that had been drained could not be cultivated for a time. The democratic government, in coordination with the People's Liberation Army, led the people in rushing to repair it again, and it was finally completed on June 8th.\n\n    The spokesperson stated: The Jiang bandits' conspiracy to breach dikes and release water did not begin this year. On August 6th of last year, under the unified command of Jiang's bandit chief Shangguan Yunxiang, they breached the south dike of the Grand Canal in the village of Liuhezhen (south of Jinghai) with a breach twelve zhang wide and one zhang six chi deep. The river water poured into Jiakouwa, and eighty-three villages and 498,000 mu of autumn fields in that area were flooded. The democratic government led the local masses in rushing to plug the breach four times, but all were sabotaged by Jiang's bandits. Our army liberated Liuhezhen in December of last year and finally repaired the breach. After that, Jiang's bandits blocked the downstream Babao sluice gate, preventing the river water from being discharged, and fifty-two villages in the area continued to suffer from flooding.\n\n    The spokesperson stated: The rainy season is approaching early, and the flood season has arrived. The Jiang and Fu bandit gangs are preparing to breach dikes and release water on a large scale again, flooding hundreds of thousands of people in Jinghai, Wenxin, and other counties. Our army has a responsibility to protect the people, and we issue a stern warning to the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs: \"If the Jiang and Fu bandit armies dare to continue breaching dikes and releasing water, harming the people, the Jiang and Fu bandits shall be responsible for the consequences.\" The spokesperson called on Party, government, military, and civilians in the border areas to be highly vigilant against the Jiang and Fu bandit gangs' conspiracy to breach dikes and release water. Armed forces in various areas should actively operate and strike at the Jiang and Fu bandit armies who dare to invade and breach dikes. All the people should unite to save themselves and wage a resolute struggle against the dike-breaching Jiang bandits.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中军区发言人　严重警告蒋傅匪帮再敢扒堤定予严惩\n\n1948-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中军区发言人\n  　严重警告蒋傅匪帮再敢扒堤定予严惩\n    【冀中电】冀中军区司令部发言人，顷对蒋、傅匪帮决堤放水，淹没冀中解放区和平居民之阴谋罪行，提出严重警告。发言人称：入春以来，蒋、傅匪帮于惨败之余，竟连续在运河、大清河、子牙河扒堤放水，淹害解放区和平居民。今年二月八日，蒋匪将静海城北王家营村南之运河堤扒开，民主政府全力领导人民抢堵，因蒋匪继续破坏，至今仍未堵住。三月四日，蒋匪在子牙河岸之李家湾子、二堡、三堡等村附近，掘开五丈宽、八尺深的决口数处，阴谋淹没贾口洼（该洼位于独流以南、子牙河以东、运河以西、静海之周庄子、贾口以北）八十余村。我民主政府和解放军领导与帮助人民日夜抢堵，始将二堡、三堡等村决口堵住，李家湾子决口由于蒋匪不断阻扰，迄今仍未堵好。今年二月间，蒋、傅匪在台头村北大清河上修拦水坝两道，使河水倒流，淹毁台头、黄岔麦田三千顷。四月三日，蒋匪又在＠里（大清河南岸）通石沟（大清河北岸）之隔淀堤决口三处。二月初，蒋匪将文安洼之泄水河口（该河口为静海属，为民主政府在民国三十四年所修，可引文安洼水入子牙河。）扒开，民主政府领导当地人民三次抢修，均被蒋匪破坏。结果文安洼水猛涨，春麦大都淹没，已脱水的二十一万亩土地一时亦不能耕种。民主政府配合解放军领导人民再次抢修，在六月八日始告竣工。\n    发言人称：蒋匪扒堤放水之阴谋罪行并非自今年始，去年八月六日，蒋匪在罪魁上官云相统一指挥下，将流河镇（静海以南）村南之运河南堤扒开宽十二丈，深丈六的决口，河水灌入贾口洼，该洼八十三个村庄、四十九万八千亩秋田均被淹没。民主政府领导当地群众四次抢堵，均被蒋匪破坏。我军在去年十二月解放流河镇，始将决口修好，其后蒋匪又将下游八堡闸口堵塞，河水不能排泄，该洼五十二个村庄继续遭受水灾。\n    发言人称：现雨季早临，汛期已到，蒋傅匪帮又准备大肆决堤放水，淹我静海、文新等县数十万人民。本军卫民有责，特严重警告蒋傅匪帮：“如蒋傅匪军胆敢继续扒堤放水，淹害人民，其后果均应由蒋傅匪负责。”发言人号召边缘区党政军民高度警惕蒋傅匪帮决堤放水之阴谋，各地武装应积极活动，打击胆敢出犯扒堤之蒋傅匪军。全体人民应团结自救，与扒堤蒋匪作坚决斗争。"

    "title": "Improved Mail Delivery in Liberated Areas and Party Newspaper Distribution; Strengthening of Taihang Postal Service Construction",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-25",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "【Taihang Electric】 Since the implementation of enterprise management in the Taihang postal service in the autumn of 1946, business has gradually become standardized and developed, and technology has been newly improved through the labor emulation campaign and technical grand competition of last year. The region now has a total of 38 county bureaus, 7 branches and simple bureaus, and 12 postal stations. In addition, 203 agency offices and stamp sales offices have been established in major villages and towns, as well as 35 district postal offices, directly handling mail, parcels, remittances, subscription to newspapers and magazines, and other businesses. The postal trunk lines, branch lines, and county-district lines connecting all parts of the region have reached more than 11,000 li. In order to develop postal services to remote mountain villages and small villages, and to make postal services serve the broad masses of people, a widespread campaign to build rural postal services has been launched this year. In the past few months, with the assistance of the Party, government, and people, more than 65,000 li of rural postal routes have been established, and villagers can directly mail letters in their villages, greatly facilitating farmers' mailing of letters. In order to train specialized postal personnel, a postal vocational school was established, and nearly 400 students have enrolled in the past three years. With the development of transportation, postal tools are also gradually being improved. More than 4,000 li of postal trunk and branch lines are delivered by train, horse-drawn carriage, bicycle, etc., except for a part that is transported by human labor. In handling mail, parcels, remittances, and other businesses, gradually achieve speed, accuracy, and insurance. Recently, in order to adapt to the gradually prosperous industrial and commercial requirements and meet social needs, the remittance limit has been increased to 150,000 yuan to 1,000,000 yuan, and the weight of parcels has been expanded to 40 jin. In terms of postal and remittance services with other liberated areas, in addition to the exchange of remittances and mutual mailing of letters and parcels with the Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji'nan, Taiyue, Beiyue, and Ji'zhong areas last year, registered mail can now also be mutually mailed with the Jin-Sui, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and Ji-Cha-Re areas. Ordinary mail delivery is available in the Northeast, North China, East China, Northwest, and Central Plains regions, except for the liberated areas south of the Yangtze River.\n\n【Another dispatch】Due to the progress of rural postal construction, the distribution of Party newspapers in the rural areas of Taihang has also been improved and developed. In the past, rural postal services in the Taihang area were generally handled by three or five people hired by the district office, and the wages of the postal workers were borne by the masses. Because there was no fixed system, they did not run to the villages regularly. Although the villages subscribed to Party newspapers, they could not see them regularly. Sometimes they received several issues at once, and sometimes they did not receive one for several days. In the past few months, through the efforts of all postal workers and the assistance of the Party, government, and people, the method of hiring people in the district has been abolished, and a number of rural postal routes from the district to the village have been established, and rural postal workers who do not break away from production have been fixed. Each 60 li run earns 5 jin to 6 jin of rice in wages. Each village hires a postal worker to be responsible for receiving, sending, and registering all letters in the village. The establishment and improvement of rural postal routes that run through large and small villages in the region not only greatly saves manpower and reduces the burden on the people, but also speeds up the time by one time compared with before. Books and newspapers from the county to the district in Wu'an can reach the villages on the same day. Rural postal workers are mostly turned-over farmers who voluntarily take on the job. These comrades have high political enthusiasm, automatically expand the distribution of Party newspapers, ensure that every village has newspapers, and ensure that they are distributed as soon as they arrive, without loss or damage, and regularly receive feedback from the masses to improve their work, so that they do not stop in wind or rain. Comrade Song Shousi, a rural postal worker in Huixian, expanded the number of subscribers to the Xinhua Daily and Dazhong Daily by more than 100 in May alone. Some postal workers, in order to overcome the difficulties of illiteracy and fear of sending the wrong items, created a method of stringing and bundling the mail in the order of the delivery villages with a long rope, and unbinding one village at a time. This reduces a lot of errors, and as a result, the distribution volume has greatly increased. In April, more than 39,800 copies of various newspapers were distributed, more than 50% more than in January. The broad masses of people reflected: \"It is more convenient than before.

    "content": "Prevention and Treatment of Summer Epidemics\n    Wang Gang\n    The weather is now hot, and mosquitoes and flies are at their peak, leading to widespread prevalence of various epidemics such as malaria and bacillary dysentery. Although our environmental sanitation is not yet modern, if everyone pays attention to personal hygiene, we can reduce the incidence of disease. Here is a brief overview of several common summer diseases:\n    (1) Malaria: Commonly known as \"da bai zi\" or \"fa nue zi,\" it is caused by a type of mosquito that bites a person with malaria, sucks blood containing malaria parasites, and then bites other healthy people, indirectly transmitting the disease.\n    Prevention methods: A. Eliminate mosquitoes by removing stagnant water pits to prevent larval breeding. B. Use mosquito nets to avoid mosquito bites. C. Isolate malaria patients to prevent them from being bitten by mosquitoes. Treatment: Patients who have already experienced an attack do not need treatment during the attack. After the attack subsides, take quinine orally, 0.5 each time, three times a day for five consecutive days, or use yellow malaria pyrimidine tablets, two tablets three times a day for three consecutive days. Injection method: Inject saline quinine solution intravenously two hours before the attack.\n    (2) Bacillary Dysentery: Commonly known as dysentery, it is divided into bacterial and amoebic types. Bacterial dysentery is more common in the summer. It is caused by flies that contaminate food with bacillary dysentery bacteria, which attach to the food and are ingested, leading to the disease. Prevention methods: Eliminate flies, use bamboo curtains and oiled cloth to prevent flies from entering the kitchen or dining room, cover cooked food with cloth, wrap tableware to prevent flies from crawling on it, do not drink raw cold water, and do not eat raw vegetables or cold food. Thoroughly disinfect the feces of dysentery patients, or cover them with lime and dry soil to prevent flies from crawling on them. Treatment: First, use saline laxatives to clear the intestinal contents, abstain from food for 24 hours, drink plenty of water, take bone charcoal kaolin orally, or use 50% magnesium sulfate (or 33% sodium sulfate solution) every four hours in doses of 2000 until cured. Sulfaguanidine is also effective.\n    (3) Cholera: It is caused by cholera bacteria that contaminate food and drink, leading to the disease. It is a terrible infectious disease that can cause death in a few hours. Symptoms: Sudden vomiting and diarrhea, cold limbs, rice-water stool, sunken eye sockets and abdomen, dry skin, weak pulse, dehydration, collapse, and painful cramps in the calf muscles. Prevention methods: Same as for bacillary dysentery. Preventive vaccines can be injected. Treatment: Rest, use cardiac stimulants, keep warm, and inject physiological saline.\n    (4) Enteritis: Commonly known as diarrhea, it is caused by unclean food, food poisoning, or abdominal cold. Symptoms: Diarrhea, loose or watery stools, containing mucus, abdominal pain, two to three or even ten or more bowel movements per day. Prevention methods: Do not eat raw or cold food, cover well with blankets at night to prevent abdominal cold. Treatment: Abstain from food for 24 hours, take a laxative to cleanse the intestines. If diarrhea persists, take astringents such as tincture of opium.\n    [Attached] Infantile Indigestion: Often occurs in summer, caused by bacterial infection or dietary imbalance. Symptoms include diarrhea with foamy mucus discharge, abdominal distension, vomiting, fever, and green stools and milk curds in infants. Prevention methods: Do not give children raw, cold, or unclean food, and do not drink cold water. Treatment: Breastfeed every four hours, reducing the amount each time. In severe cases, abstain from food for one day and drink plenty of water. First use a laxative to cleanse the intestines, then use S.T. and other antiseptic disinfectants. Do not use astringents.\n    (5) Heatstroke: People working in high heat and humidity, or marching in hot weather, can develop heatstroke. Symptoms can be divided into the following two types:\n    A. Heat Exhaustion: Symptoms include general weakness, dizziness, confusion, pale complexion, profuse sweating, little urine, difficulty breathing, rapid pulse, low blood pressure, sometimes spasmodic pain in the abdomen and limbs, cold and clammy skin, but elevated rectal temperature. Most patients with this condition can recover, but some may die from heart failure. B. Heatstroke: Caused by excessive dysfunction of the body's temperature regulation mechanism. Patients develop the condition suddenly and may die immediately. Most patients first experience headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, and nausea. Later, they become unconscious, with a flushed face, dry skin, and fever. In severe cases, the body temperature rises to 42-43 degrees Celsius. If they can survive until the second day, they can be cured. Prevention methods: In hot summer weather, wear a straw hat or cover your head with a towel soaked in cold water when walking, and drink plenty of water. If you feel uncomfortable, find a shady place to rest. Treatment: (1) Patients with heat exhaustion should be quickly moved to a shady place, loosen clothing, and rest slightly to recover. In severe cases, stimulant cardiac agents should be injected. (2) For heatstroke, treatment should be given immediately with a cold water bath or cold water enema until the body temperature reaches below 39 degrees Celsius. The heart should be carefully monitored, and cardiac stimulants should be given immediately if there are signs of heart failure. If there are symptoms of pulmonary congestion, phlebotomy may be performed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 夏季流行病的预防法和治疗法\n王钢\n1948-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：卫生常识\n\n　　夏季流行病的预防法和治疗法\n    王钢\n    现在天气炎热，蚊蝇最多，因此各种流行病，如疟疾、赤立肠炎等流行甚广。我们环境卫生不能现代化，但如果大家能注意个人卫生，疾病也能减少。兹将夏季流行的数种疾病简述如下：\n    （一）疟疾：俗名打摆子或发疟子，原因是一种疟蚊咬了患疟疾病的人吸了含有疟原虫的血液，又咬了其他健康人，间接传染疾病。\n    预防方法：Ａ、灭蚊，将死水坑除掉不使幼虫繁殖。Ｂ、挂蚊帐以免蚊咬。Ｃ、隔离患疟疾病人不被蚊咬。治疗法：已发作之病人不必治疗，待发作过去后内服奎宁每次０．５，一日三次连服五天，或用黄色疟涤平片，每日三次每服二片，连服三天。注射法：于发作前两小时用盐奎注射液静脉注射。\n    （二）赤痢：俗名痢疾，分细菌性和阿米巴性两种，夏季流行多为细菌性，原因是饮食被污染赤痢杆菌之苍蝇爬过将病菌附着于食物上，吞下后引起之疾病。预防法：灭蝇，用竹帘糊冷布以防蝇侵入厨房或饭厅，做好饭用布盖好，食器包好不使蝇爬，不饮生冷水不吃生菜冷饭。赤痢病人大便严密消毒，或用石灰干土盖好避免蝇爬。治疗法：先用盐类泻药清除肠内容，绝食廿四小时，多饮水，内服骨炭白陶土，或用５０％硫酸镁（或３３％硫酸钠水）间四小时服２０００到治愈为止，磺胺胍亦有确效。\n    （三）霍乱：原因是一种霍乱菌由蝇污染饮食物使人发病，为一种可怕的传染病，数小时死亡。症状：突然上吐下泻四肢发冷，排泄米汤样便，眼窝及腹部塌陷，皮肤干燥，脉搏细小，呈脱水状况，陷于虚脱腓肠肌痛疼痉挛。预防法：同赤痢，可以注射预防疫苗。治疗法：安静用强心剂，保温，注射生理食盐水。\n    （四）肠炎：俗名泻肚，原因为饮食不洁，食物中毒，腹部寒冷。症状：腹泻大便稀软或为水样液体，含有粘液，有腹痛者，每日大便二三次至十数次。预防法：不吃生冷食物，夜晚盖好被子，不使腹部受凉。治疗法：绝食二十四小时，服泻剂清肠，如果腹泻不止，可服收敛剂阿片酊等。\n    【附】小儿消化不良：多发生于夏季由细菌感染或食量失调所引起。症状为下痢排泄物有泡沫粘液，腹胀，呕吐，发热，乳儿有绿便及奶瓣。预防法：不给小儿生冷不洁食物，不饮冷水。治疗法：每间四小时哺乳一次减量，重症绝食一日，多饮水。先用泻剂清肠，然后用Ｓ·Ｔ·等防腐消毒剂，不可用收敛剂。\n    （五）中暑：在高热及湿度过高之空气中工作之人，暑天行军走路皆可发生中暑，症状可分下列二种。\n    Ａ热竭：症状为全身无力、头晕，神识不清、面色苍白、大汗尿少，呼吸困难、脉搏频、血压下降，有时腹部及四肢有痉挛性痛疼，皮肤冷湿，但直肠温度增高。患此病者大多数可以恢复，但亦有因心力衰竭而死亡者。Ｂ中暑：因病人体温调节机能过度失调所致。病人突然发病有立即死亡者。多数病人先觉头痛头晕眼花作呕。以后昏迷不醒，面色发红，皮肤干燥，发热。病重时体温至四十二三度。如能延至第二日可以治愈。预防法：夏季正炎热，走路带草帽或用手巾沾冷水盖头部，多饮水。自觉不舒服时，找荫凉处休息。治疗法：（一）患热竭者速移至荫凉处松开衣服稍加休息即可复原，重者须注射兴奋强心剂。（二）中暑，应速治疗立即给以冷水浴或用冷水灌肠，直至体温至三十九度以下。心脏最应注意，如有心力衰竭时，立予强心剂，如有肺充血症状时，可行静脉放血术。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "【Taihang Telegram】Under the leadership of Shi Cunjin, a top-level labor hero in the Taihang area, the production movement in Huo Jiayao Village, Licheng, has achieved significant results this year, with some areas exceeding previous years. 1945 was the best year for the production movement in the village in the decade from the end of the war against Japan to 1947, but the entire village only had sixteen head of livestock, and major agricultural tools were also lacking. This year, the number of livestock has increased to thirty-five, and the number of major agricultural tools has tripled. At the beginning of the spring plowing season this year, the masses had some misunderstandings about the Land Law, and their thinking was very confused, and their enthusiasm for production was not high. Shi Cunjin knew that everyone was afraid of disrupting the equal distribution, so he bought more than five mu of land, exchanged his donkey for two good mules, and repaired agricultural tools to motivate the masses. At the same time, he actively publicized and explained the party's policy to the masses, saying: \"The district party committee has announced that land reform in our district has been basically completed and will no longer be equally distributed. From now on, the focus of work should be shifted from land reform to production.\" This eliminated the masses' ideological concerns, and they all said, \"Let's produce well! Would the old hero still be willing to buy land if we were dividing it equally?\" The spring plowing movement then began. More than thirty loads of fertilizer were applied per mu of autumn land. The land was plowed and harrowed once each, and the land for planting Jin Huanghou (a crop variety) was plowed and harrowed twice each, with up to forty loads of manure applied per mu. Both the amount of fertilizer and the number of plowing and harrowing times exceeded previous years. The village is always prepared to support the front line and prevent spring drought. Shi Cunjin proposed: \"After the intercalary month, we will farm as soon as the race is over, plant as quickly as possible, and guard against spring drought.\" He took the lead in promoting the entire village to plant early, and also led everyone to reclaim wasteland and plant sixteen mu of hemp. As of the beginning of this month, all the village's valley land has been weeded twice, cotton has been weeded three times, and corn has been weeded twice, with topdressing fertilizer applied. During seedling pulling and weeding, the village implemented technical guidance. At the beginning, Shi Cunjin convened a technical committee to study weeding techniques, showed everyone the seedlings he had pulled from his 811 valley, and experimented with using Yangtao root and tobacco stems to boil water to treat cotton oil drought (pests), promoting the entire village to treat oil drought. When weeding seedlings, the experienced farmers and semi-skilled farmers were interspersed, helping each other to observe and inspect each other at any time. After the second weeding was completed, a bottom-up summary was conducted. The masses unanimously affirmed that \"If you want to harvest more grain, you must weed more and apply more fertilizer.\" Shi Cunjin seized on everyone's understanding, raised it, and made a half-year production plan: autumn crops are required to increase the yield of fine grains by three sheng per mu. Valley land should be weeded three times, corn should be weeded three times, with one application of topdressing fertilizer, Jin Huanghou should be weeded four times, with two applications of topdressing fertilizer, and cotton should be weeded five times, and all should be stripped, branched, and have the oil bars removed. After the rain, 70 mu of wasteland should be reclaimed and vegetables should be sown, drought-resistant canals should be repaired, and seedlings should be watered to protect them and fight against drought. Wheat fields should be expanded, Artemisia collected, and fertilizer should be collected to ensure that each mu of wheat field is fertilized with thirty-five loads. Sideline production, from the beginning of spring plowing, has been paid attention to in conjunction with agriculture and implemented throughout the year. Thirty head of livestock and fourteen people went out to transport goods, earning 1,513,000 yuan (Ji currency) in two and a half months; making saltpeter earned more than 36,000 jin of rice. Now thirty head of livestock and fourteen people continue to transport, and sixty-nine people make saltpeter. The village has one hundred and thirty spinning women and twenty-one weaving women, with a half-month plan to spin 274 jin of cotton and weave 183 zhang of cloth, so as not to buy cloth when the seasons change, and strive to sell some.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行头等劳英石寸金积极领导　霍家窑生产超过往年\n\n1948-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行头等劳英石寸金积极领导\n  　霍家窑生产超过往年\n    【太行电】黎城霍家窑村今年的生产运动，在太行区头等劳动英雄石寸金领导下，目前已获显著成绩。有些部分已超过往年。一九四五年是该村抗战以后到一九四七年十年间生产运动最好的一年，但全村只有牲口十六头，主要农具也很缺乏；今年牲口增至三十五头，主要农具增加三倍。今年春耕开始，群众因对土地法有若干误解，思想很乱，生产劲头不大；石寸金知道大家是怕打乱平分，一面买了五亩多地，又把驴子换成两条好骡，修理农具，以此推动群众；一面积极向群众宣传解释党的政策说：“区党委已经公布，我区土改已经基本完成不再平分了，今后应把工作重心从土改转到生产方面去。”消除了群众思想顾虑，都说：“好好生产吧！要是平分，老英雄还肯买地哩？”春耕运动便开展起来。秋地施肥每亩都在三十驮以上。犁耙各一次，种金皇后的地犁耙各两遍，每亩上粪达四十驮。施肥与耙犁次数都超过往年。该村时刻准备支援前线及预防春旱，石寸金提出：“过了闰月年，跑马就种田，赶垧下种，防备春旱”，自己带头，推动全村提前下了种，又领导大家开荒，种了十六亩大麻。截至本月初，该村全部谷地已普锄两遍，棉花普锄三遍，玉茭锄过两遍，并上了追肥。拔苗锄苗中，该村贯彻了技术指导。一开始石寸金即召开技术委员会，研究锄苗技术，把自己八一一谷拔过的苗让大家看，并试验出用杨桃根和烟筋熬水治棉花油旱（害虫）的办法，推动全村治油旱。锄苗时，把全把式和半把式夹开，随时互助观摩，互相检查。二锄完成后，随即进行了自下而上的总结。群众一致肯定了“要想多打粮，就得多锄多上肥。”石寸金抓住大家这个认识，提高起来，制出半年生产计划：秋禾要求每亩地增产细粮三升。谷地普锄三次，土玉茭锄三次，上一次追肥，金皇后锄四次，上两次追肥，棉花锄五次，并全部脱裤、打杈打油条。雨后要开荒撒菜七十亩，修理旱水渠，浇苗保苗，与旱灾作斗争。要扩大麦田，割蒿集肥，保证每亩麦田施肥三十五驮。副业生产，从春耕开始即注意与农业结合，贯彻全年。三十头牲口和十四个人出外运输，两月半赚洋一百五十一万三千元（冀钞）；熬硝赚米三万六千多斤。现三十头牲口和十四个人继续运输，六十九人熬硝。全村一百三十个纺妇，二十一个织妇，半月计划纺花二百七十四斤，织布一百八十三丈，做到换季不买布，争取卖一部。"

    "content": "Forced Organization of Waterwheel Production Results in Losses\nMistakes in the Practices of Guanshang and Xixiu Villages in Xiyang County\n\n[This Newspaper] News: The organization of waterwheels for irrigation in Xixiu Village, Xingtang County, and Guanshang Village, Xinle County, infringed on the ownership and usage rights of waterwheel owners, harmed the interests of middle peasants, and had an adverse impact on the production enthusiasm of other farmers. This deviation is a very noteworthy issue in areas with irrigated land. Xixiu Village originally had fifty-four waterwheels and seventy-three wells, with all 2,245 mu of land in the village irrigated by waterwheels. Since \"organizing\" in 1946, only eighteen good waterwheels remain; the rest are incomplete, and two of the damaged ones don't even equal one functioning one. In the past, each waterwheel could irrigate four to six mu per day; now it only irrigates one and a half to three mu. The vast majority of waterwheel owners (out of the village’s 197 households, 132 own waterwheels, of which 104 are middle peasants, the others being poor peasants, landlords and rich peasants) are very dissatisfied with this \"organized\" approach. Originally, the village's \"organization\" of waterwheels was based on the condition of the waterwheel and the depth of the well. A few cadres forced the past privately owned waterwheels to be fixed at a well, defining the scope of irrigation, and not allowing them to be moved at will. For example, the waterwheel of the new middle peasant Zhao Luorui was fixed in the south of the village the year before last. With only people using it and no one repairing it, it broke down last year. Luorui spent his own money to repair it, but village cadres Lu Yuanwen and others ordered him to fix the waterwheel in the north of the village. Luorui was unwilling to do so, so Lu Yuanwen and others threatened him with the label of \"special agent sabotaging production.\" He had no choice but to swallow his anger and obey. Many waterwheel owners had their good waterwheels fixed to irrigate other people's land, while their own wells were fixed with other people's bad waterwheels. The waterwheel of middle peasant Lu Lai was fixed in the south of the village, unable to irrigate any of his own land; Li Baisui's waterwheel was fixed in the east of the village as soon as it was repaired, and his land in the northeast of the village was damaged by drought. When fixing waterwheels, the scope of irrigation and the number of mu to be irrigated by each waterwheel were not discussed by the masses based on the actual situation, and the decisions were very unreasonable. In the northeast and east of the village, each fixed waterwheel had to irrigate sixty or seventy mu of land. When there was a drought, they could not keep up, and could only plant one season, which was equivalent to turning irrigated land into dry land. Some fixed waterwheels in the west of the village only irrigated thirty or so mu. The uneven workload affected production. In the past, when waterwheels were not \"organized,\" many households without waterwheels tried to borrow from others. If they couldn't irrigate during the day, they could find time to irrigate at night, and all the land in the village could be irrigated. Since the waterwheels were \"organized,\" households without waterwheels thought, \"The waterwheels are now public property, and we have the right to use them.\" Some were even tougher than the waterwheel owners, vying to irrigate during the day. The waterwheel owners said, \"Fine! The waterwheels have become official property, we don't care anymore!\" Households without waterwheels felt that the waterwheels were not their own, so they didn't take care to maintain them and were unwilling to spend money on repairs. Therefore, many waterwheels in the village have been damaged in the past two years. Sometimes, the original owner's waterwheel was not broken, but they had to contribute money to repair other people's broken waterwheels. As a result, not only were the broken waterwheels not managed, but those who planned to buy waterwheels no longer bought them. Many people reflected, \"If we weren't organized, we would sell our pants to buy a coat and repair the waterwheel, and we could even add a few new ones.\" Households like middle peasant Lu Luoshan had bought all the wood and other materials to repair the waterwheel, but when they heard that they would still be \"organized\" as before, they returned the purchased items. The reporter interviewed several main cadres of the village and asked, \"With your method of organizing, who would be willing to buy a waterwheel?\" One village cadre replied, \"We can use this method: whoever buys a new waterwheel will be rewarded by not being ‘organized’ for two years.\"\n\nThis year, a similar deviation occurred in Guanshang Village, Xinyao. The village has a total of twenty-one waterwheels, of which eight and a half were confiscated during the anti-black earth campaign and not distributed (originally belonging to landlords, rich peasants, and wealthy downgraded middle peasants), and thirteen and a half belonged to middle peasants (including twenty-three middle peasant households, with varying shares). Regarding these waterwheels, the cadres stipulated, \"The whole village will repair and use them uniformly.\" \"In order to prevent the 'selfishness' of the original waterwheel owners,\" it was stipulated: \"No one's waterwheel can be placed in their own irrigation area; they must be deliberately separated.\" This year, the repair of waterwheels used approximately 30 million yuan worth of undistributed floating wealth, and another three shi and six dou of wages in rice were allocated to middle peasants and above, regardless of whether they owned waterwheels, according to a unified progressive tax scale. The waterwheel owners' ownership and usage rights were restricted and deprived. Nominally, whoever owned the waterwheel still owned it, but in reality, it had become the village's public property. Middle peasant Qiu Luo, who cultivated more than ten mu of land and originally owned a waterwheel independently, told the reporter at this time, \"Now what's yours and what's mine! As long as we can irrigate the land! Sooner or later everything belongs to the collective, right?!\" His words represented the thinking of the general middle peasants. Therefore, \"Everyone is very poor at looking after and caring for the waterwheels,\" \"Although there are rules, damage still occurs frequently.\"\n\nIn late June of this year, Xingtang County used Xixiu Village as a model to rectify the waterwheel organization, proposing to \"clearly guarantee the ownership of the waterwheel owners,\" and preparing to solicit the opinions of the waterwheel owners after the autumn harvest to appropriately adjust the position of the waterwheels and the scope of irrigation. The government has provided loans to assist in repairing waterwheels. From the end of June to the beginning of July, thirty waterwheels have been repaired, of which seven were completely unusable in the past, but are now functional. These measures prove that the local leadership is also attempting to solve the waterwheel problem, which is good. However, the past methods of harming the interests of waterwheel owners (the vast majority of whom are middle peasants) have not been fundamentally changed, such as \"organizing a 'Waterwheel Management Committee,' with a group leader for every ten waterwheels,\" with small groups evaluating irrigation and the group leader in control, implementing \"rotational irrigation.\" During repairs, the owners of eighteen waterwheels independently repaired their own, and still had to allocate repair costs to others. This is still a method of infringing on the waterwheel owners' ownership and usage rights. It must be recognized that organization is good, but the principle of voluntary equivalence must be truly implemented. Departing from this principle, no matter what the motivation, the result will only lead to mistakes.\n\n(Shao Min, Bai Yufeng)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 强制组织水车生产受到损失　西秀贯上两村做法错误\n邵民　白玉峰\n1948-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　强制组织水车生产受到损失\n  　西秀贯上两村做法错误\n    【本报讯】行唐县西秀村、新乐县贯上村组织水车浇地，侵犯水车主的所有权与使用权，侵害中农的利益，对其他农民的生产积极性也产生了不利的影响。这在水浇地地区是一件十分值得注意的偏向。西秀村原有五十四架水车，七十三眼井，全村二二四五亩土地，全是用水车浇。自一九四六年“组织起来”，至今只剩下十八架好水车，其余都残缺不全，两架也顶不上一架用。过去每架水车一天可浇四亩至六亩，现在只浇一亩半至三亩。绝大部分水车主（该村共一九七户，有水车户共一三二户，其中中农占一○四户，其他是贫农与地富的）对这种“组织起来”的办法非常不满意。原来该村“组织”水车是根据水车好坏，水井深浅，由少数干部强迫把过去私人的水车，固定在一个井上，划定浇地范围，不能随便移动。例如新中农赵落瑞一架水车，前年被固定在村南，光有人使，没有人修，去年坏了，洛瑞自己花钱刚修好，村干部卢元文等又命令他把水车固定在村北，洛瑞不愿这么办，卢元文等以“特务破坏生产”的帽子威胁他，他只好忍气吞声的服从了。有许多水车主，自家的好水车被固定出去浇别人的地，自己井上却固定着别人的坏水车。中农卢来的一架水车被固定在村南，浇不上自家一分地；李白岁一架水车刚修好，就被固定在村东，他村东北的地便旱坏了。固定水车时，每个水车的浇地范围及浇地亩数又未根据实际情形由群众讨论，定的很不合理。该村东北和村东，每个固定水车要浇六七十亩地，旱时忙不过来，只能种一季，等于把水地变成旱地。村西固定水车有的才浇三十余亩。忙闲不匀，影响了生产。过去水车未“组织起来”时，许多没有水车户设法借别人的用，白天不能浇，晚上可抽空浇，全村的地都能浇了。自从水车“组织起来”，没有水车的户以为“水车归公了，使水车有权”；有的甚至比水车主还来得硬气，抢着要白天浇，水车主们说：“得了！水车成了官的了，咱不管了！”没水车户觉着水车不是自己的，使用上也不加意爱护，更不愿出钱修理。因此，该村两年来损坏水车甚多，有时原主的水车并没有坏，但得摊款修理别人的坏水车。这么一来，不但坏的无人管理，打算购买水车的也不再购买了。不少群众反映：“要是不组织起来，卖裤子当袄也要修理水车，并且还能增加几架新的。”中农卢洛善等户把修理水车的木料等都买妥了，听说还要照旧“组织”起来，又把买好的东西退回去了。记者曾访问过该村几个主要干部，问：“照你们这种组织起来的办法，谁还肯买水车？”一个村干回答说：“可以用这个办法：谁再买上新水车，两年内不‘组织’来奖励他。”\n    新药贯上村今年也发生了类似的偏向。该村共有二十一辆水车，其中八架半是在反黑地时斗出来未分配的（原是地主富农及富降中农的水车），十三架半是中农的（包括二十三户中农，股份多少不等）。对于这些水车，干部规定“全村统一修理，统一使用。”“为了防止原水车主的‘自私性’”，规定：“谁的水车不能按在谁的浇地区，故意插划开。”今年修理水车动用了未分配的约值三千万元的浮财，另由中农以上成份，不论有无水车一律按统一累进税分数摊派了三石六斗工资米。水车主的水车所有权和使用权都被限制和剥夺了，名义上谁的水车还是谁的，实际上已变为村公有了。中农邱洛乐种着十余亩地，原来独自有一架水车，这时他对记者说：“现在什么你的我的呀！咱能浇上地就行了！东西谁的是谁的，早晚还不是归伙？！”他的话代表着一般中农的思想，于是“大家对水车爱护看管上，就很差了”，“虽有纪律，损坏的现象还是时常发生。”\n    行唐县今年六月下旬，以西秀村作典型，整顿水车组织，提出“明确保证水车主的所有权”，准备秋后征求水车主的意见，适当调整水车位置与浇地范围。政府曾贷款协助修理水车，自六月底至七月初，已修了三十架，其中七架过去根本不能用，现在能用了。这些措施证明当地领导上也在企图解决水车问题，这是好的。但是过去损害水车主（绝大多数为中农）利益的办法并没有根本的改变，如“组织了‘水车管理委员会’，十架水车一个大组长”，浇地时小组评议，组长掌握，实行“轮浇”。修理时，有十八架水车的车主独立修理了自己的，还给别人的摊了修理费。这还是侵犯水车主所有权与使用权的办法。必须认识：组织起来是好的，但必须真正贯彻自愿等价的原则，离开这个原则，不管从什么动机出发，结果都只会造成错误。　　　　　　　　\n　　　（邵民、白玉峰）"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The People's Congress of Gengle Village, Shexian County\nHow to Conduct Democratic Leadership\n\tWang Chaojin\n\tThe People's Congress of Gengle Village, Shexian County, was established in January of this year. Over the past few months, it has established a system of democratic centralism and implemented a new style of leadership, achieving preliminary results and experience. The following is an introduction:\n\t1. Everyone Cares About the People's Congress\n\tMajor issues concerning all strata of the village's population must be discussed and resolved by the People's Congress before they can be implemented. The resolutions of each People's Congress are of great concern to the masses of all strata. During the rectification campaign, poor peasants paid close attention to how the People's Congress would decide on compensating middle peasants who had been wrongly labeled, whether they would have to return the fruits entirely from their own pockets, or whether other methods would be considered. When re-examining and correcting class designations, many households that had been struggled against sought out middle and poor peasant representatives with whom they had connections, asking, \"You must bring it up at the People's Congress, no matter what. My class status really doesn't qualify me as a landlord or rich peasant.\" When allocating land, middle peasant Zhang Fubang told the representative in his alley, \"I don't know how the People's Congress will decide on the land allocation method! Will it involve moving middle peasant land? When you representatives go to the meeting, suggest to everyone that we shouldn't use the old rigid method of dividing it equally based on the number of people in each household and whether they have enough grain and land. This time, it should be more flexible, and taking land should be truly voluntary.\" On issues such as resolving production difficulties, issuing loans, providing relief from spring famine, rectifying corvée labor, substitute cultivation, and organizing rectification mutual aid teams, the masses of all strata had many opinions, asking representatives to bring them up for discussion at the People's Congress. The resolutions of the People's Congress are based on policies and the opinions of the masses, and are made through everyone's discussion, so the masses implement them very conscientiously. They said, \"The People's Congress is truly a place where we, the masses, are the masters,\" and \"Many of the resolutions made by the People's Congress are the same as what we were thinking.\" Village cadres feel that they have a basis to rely on when dealing with problems. They said, \"For all the major issues in the village concerning all strata of the population, we convene a representative meeting for democratic consultation, and the resolutions made must be followed. We just handle problems based on the resolutions, which is much more thorough than having just a few cadres decide on the problems. It's true that with more people, there are more ideas, and everything can be taken care of. It's much easier for us to handle. We don't need to order the masses; the masses themselves implement their own resolutions. We just need to take the lead and guide them.\"\n\t2. How Does the People's Congress Conduct Correct Democratic Leadership?\n\tThe People's Congress should not be convened lightly. Only when there are principled and universal issues affecting the entire village should the representative meeting be convened for discussion and resolution, which is then handed over to the village government for implementation. Daily individual problems are resolved by the village government, which reports to the People's Congress periodically.\n\tBefore convening the People's Congress, the Party branch first convenes a meeting to discuss major issues arising among the masses and the tasks for each period, making resolutions that the branch committee suggests to the presidium of the People's Congress. After accepting the suggestions, the presidium then discusses how to convene the representative meeting in light of the actual situation in the village, what issues need to be resolved, and how to resolve these issues, making preliminary plans. The agricultural association committee members and People's Congress representatives then carry out activities among the agricultural association members and the masses, soliciting opinions from the masses, listening to the voices of the masses, and convening agricultural association groups for extensive deliberation, so that the representatives can collect the opinions of the broad masses and bring them to the representative meeting for discussion. If the presidium of the People's Congress does not accept the branch's suggestions, all Party members must implement the decisions of the People's Congress and must not engage in coercion or divisive actions, but may continue to strive to persuade the masses to agree.\n\tWhen the People's Congress is formally convened, the presidium reports to all the representatives on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous People's Congress, and proposes the issues that need to be resolved by this representative meeting. The village government also reports on the work of the government to the representative meeting. All the representatives deliberate and discuss in groups based on alleys, and then convene a general meeting to review the implementation of the resolutions of the previous People's Congress and the work of the government, and to discuss the principles and methods for resolving the newly raised issues. After debate, a resolution is made, and finally it is voted on and passed.\n\tDuring the representatives' discussion, democracy is fully promoted. There are criticisms and debates; sometimes the opinions of the poor peasant representatives and the middle peasant representatives are inconsistent, and sometimes the opinions of the Party member representatives and the mass representatives are inconsistent, but everyone is allowed to state their reasons. The leadership encourages correct opinions based on the spirit of the policies, explains the advantages and disadvantages, gradually opens up thinking, and finally uses the principle of the minority submitting to the majority to vote and pass a formal resolution.\n\tAfter the People's Congress adjourns, the presidium is responsible for promoting and inspecting the implementation of the People's Congress resolutions by the village government and the masses, studying whether the resolutions themselves are correct, what the reactions are among the masses, and accepting temporary opinions and issues raised by the masses. When it is not necessary to convene a representative meeting, the presidium convenes a meeting to make temporary resolutions and hand them over to the village government for implementation, but must report to the next representative meeting to obtain ratification.\n\tAfter the People's Congress adjourns, the representatives are responsible for conveying the resolutions in an organized manner. They also use various methods such as writing, mass blackboards, radio stations, and oral publicity to inform the masses of the entire village so that the masses can discuss and consciously implement them. Party members and cadres use various opportunities to explain the People's Congress resolutions to the masses and widely collect opinions from the masses. If there are inappropriate parts of the resolutions, or if the majority of the masses are dissatisfied, they are promptly reported to the presidium of the People's Congress for research and discussion, or the People's Congress is convened again to discuss and revise them.\n\tEach representative meeting reviews the presidium's and the village government's reports on the implementation of the resolutions, makes criticisms of those that have not been implemented, and makes commendations and criticisms of the village cadres. At the Fifth People's Congress, the representatives criticized Wang Donglin, the chairman of the alley agricultural association, for being irresponsible in his work, only finding it troublesome when the masses asked him to solve problems. He also made a personal self-criticism, and now he is very responsible in his work. He said, \"I must do my work well, otherwise, how can I be worthy of the masses?\" At each representative meeting, the implementation of the People's Congress resolutions and the work of the village government must be reviewed.\n\tIn the implementation of the People's Congress resolutions, we often encounter individual extremely bad democratic elements who have no regard for discipline and defy the People's Congress resolutions without good reason. The village government puts forward criticisms of these people and orders them to implement the resolutions.\n[Taihang Branch News]\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 涉县更乐村人代会　怎样进行民主领导\n王朝进\n1948-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　涉县更乐村人代会\n  　怎样进行民主领导\n    王朝进\n    涉县更乐村人民代表会是今年一月成立的。几个月来，建立民主集中制，实行新的领导作风，获得初步成绩与经验，现介绍于下：\n    一、人人关心人代会\n    有关全村各阶层群众的大事，都要经过人民代表会讨论，作出决议才能执行。每次人代会的决议，各阶层群众都很关心。在纠偏时，贫农很注意人代会怎样决定补偿错斗中农，是不是要完全从自己身上往出退果实，还是另外想些办法。在重新审查订正成份时，许多被斗户找与他们有联系的中贫农代表，要求“你去代表会无论如何给咱提一下，我的成份实在够不上地主富农。”在抽补土地时，中农张福邦给他同巷的代表说：“不知道人代会怎么决定抽补办法呀！是不是要动中农土地？你们代表去开会时，给大家提个意见，不要象以前按每户人数、粮齐地齐的死办法打乱平分。这次应活便一些，拿地要让大家真正自愿。”在解决生产困难、发放贷款、救济春荒、整顿差务、代耕、组织整顿互助组等问题上，各阶层群众都有许多意见，要求代表替自己提到人代会去讨论。人代会的决议是根据政策与群众的意见经过大家讨论做出来的，群众都很认真执行。他们说：“人代会真是咱群众当家做主的地方”，“人代会作的决议有许多与咱想的意见是一个样”。村干部处理问题，这时感到有了依靠。他们说：“全村有关各阶层群众的大事，召开代表会民主商讨，作出决议都得照办，咱就根据决议处理问题，这比过去几个干部决定问题周到得多。真是人多意见广，处处都能照顾到，咱这就好办的多了。不用咱去命令群众，群众自己去执行自己的决议，咱只带头领领就行了。”\n    二、人代会怎样进行正确的民主领导？\n    人代会不能轻易召开。全村带有原则性的、普遍性的问题，才召开代表会讨论。作出解决问题的决议，交村政府执行。日常的个别的问题，则由村政府解决，并定期向人代会做报告。\n    在开人代会之前，党的支部即召开会议，讨论群众中发生的重大问题，与各时期的工作任务，作出决议，由支委会建议人代会主席团，主席团接受建议后，即结合村中实际情况讨论代表会如何召开，要解决那些问题，及如何解决这些问题，作出初步方案，由农会委员、人代会代表分别在农会会员中及群众中活动，征求群众意见，倾听群众呼声，召开农会小组广泛酝酿，使代表能收集广大群众的意见带到代表会上讨论，如果人代会主席团不接受支部建议时，支部党员皆须执行人代会决定，不得有强迫或分裂行动，但可继续争取说服群众同意。\n    正式召开人代会时，主席团向全体代表报告前届人代会决议执行情况，提出这次代表会需要解决的问题。村政府也向代表会报告政府工作。全体代表以巷为单位，分小组酝酿讨论，然后召开大会，检查前届人代会决议的执行情形与政府的工作，讨论解决新提问题的原则与办法。经过争论作出决议，最后表决通过。\n    在代表讨论中，充分发扬民主。有批评有争论；有时贫农代表与中农代表意见不一致，有时党员代表与群众代表意见不一致，但允许各说各的理由。领导上以政策的精神鼓励正确的意见，说明厉害，逐步打通思想，最后用少数服从多数的原则表决通过，作出正式决议。\n    人代会闭会后，主席团负责推动检查村政府与群众对人代会决议的执行，研究决议本身正确与否，在群众中有何反映，接受群众临时性的意见及提出的问题。不需召开代表会时，即召开主席团会议，作出临时决议，交村政府执行，但须向下届代表会作报告，取得追认。\n    人代会闭会后，代表负责把决议有组织的传达下去。并用文字、大众黑板、广播台、口头宣传等各种方式，告给全村群众，让群众讨论自觉执行。党员、干部运用各种机会向群众讲解人代会决议，广泛搜集群众意见。如决议有不妥当处，或大多数群众不满意，就及时反映给人代会主席团研究讨论，或召开人代会重新讨论修改。\n    每次代表会都检查主席团与村政府所作决议执行情况的报告，对执行不到的提出批评，对村干部提出表扬和批评。在第五次人代会上，代表批评巷农会主席王东林工作不负责，群众找他解决问题只嫌麻烦，他个人也作了检讨，现在工作很负责。他说：“工作可得好好干才行，不然，怎能对得起群众？”在每次代表会上，要检查人代会决议执行与村政府工作。\n    在执行人代会决议中，常遇到个别目无纪律的极坏民主分子，无正当理由，违抗人代会决议。村政府对这些人即提出批评意见，令其执行。\n    【太行分社电】"

    "content": "[Chahar News] Through the vigorous leadership and education of county and district cadres, the masses in the Fourth District of Laishui have broken with certain conservative habits in agricultural production and have gradually improved their techniques. The district has thirty villages, with a total of 18,538 mu of land. In the past, due to a lack of attention to improving agricultural techniques, the production volume was very low. Generally, dry land only yielded six or seven dou per mu annually (each dou being eighteen jin). The farming methods of the local farmers had the following shortcomings: (1) They were not accustomed to autumn plowing, fearing that the soil would be blown away by the wind if the land was plowed in the autumn, and they also disliked that autumn plowing would mean they had to plow again in the spring, which they found troublesome and laborious. (2) They were unwilling to plow and sow early in the spring, often sowing without plowing, or plowing and sowing at the same time. (3) Except for planting millet on flat land, corn, beans, and other crops were mostly sown randomly, scattering the seeds on the ground, plowing it once, and considering it finished. (4) They had no habit of accumulating fertilizer. Households did not have toilets, did not cut artemisia, or press green manure. Pigs were not kept in pens, and cow and sheep pens were not lined with soil, so the land could not be fertilized much. (5) Stubble was left in the fields after the autumn harvest. Last winter and this spring, through vigorous education and leadership, some old habits have been initially improved. Half of the villages in the district implemented autumn plowing, accounting for about 20 percent of the total land. This spring, during plowing and sowing, the leadership again emphasized early plowing, drilling, or dibbling, calling for no planting on stubble land and no random sowing. Around the Qingming Festival, they promptly organized livestock teams and manpower to pull plows, mobilizing men, women, and children to complete plowing and sowing in half a month. According to incomplete statistics for the district, 2,930 mu of corn were drilled and 5,805 mu were dibbled, accounting for about 40 percent of the total land. Currently, the first weeding has been completed in the entire district, and the second weeding in most villages is one-sixth complete. According to the masses, drilling and dibbling are easier to weed and save labor, but some new shortcomings have also emerged, namely, the seedlings from drilling are too dense, and some people who dibble do not know how to thin the seedlings. There has also been considerable progress in accumulating fertilizer. According to incomplete statistics, 931 toilets have been dug in the entire district. Currently, during the artemisia cutting season, a vigorous green manure pressing campaign has been launched to lay the foundation for fertilization next year. In the autumn harvest, they also plan to vigorously lead autumn plowing to transform the conservative farming habits of the local masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 涞水四区群众逐渐打破旧习　农业技术初步提高\n\n1948-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　涞水四区群众逐渐打破旧习\n  　农业技术初步提高\n    【察哈尔讯】经县区干部大力领导教育，涞水四区群众打破农业生产上某些保守习惯，逐步提高了技术。该区三十个村，共有地一万八千五百三十八亩，过去因不注意改进农业技术，致生产量很低，一般旱地每亩常年产量仅六、七斗（每斗十八斤）。当地农民的耕作方法有以下几个缺点：（一）不习惯秋耕地，怕秋天耕了地被风刮去了土，并嫌秋耕了春天还要耕，麻烦费事。（二）春天不愿早耕早种，常常不耕就种，或现种现耕。（三）除平地谷耩种外，棒子豆类大都是乱撒种，把籽乱撒到地里，一耕就算完事。（四）没有积肥习惯，住户没有厕所，不打蒿不压绿肥，养猪没有圈，牛羊圈里不垫土，地里不能多上粪。（五）秋收时地里留禾楂。去冬与今春，经过领导上大力教育与领导，当地某些旧习惯已有初步改进。全区有半数村庄实行了秋耕，约占总土地的百分之二十。今年春耕播种时，领导上又有重点的提倡早耕、耩种或点种，号召不种楂地、不乱撒田。在清明前后，就抓紧组织牲口犋及人拉犁，动员男女老少，在半月中完成耕种。据全区不完全的统计，玉米耩种二千九百三十亩、点种五千八百零五亩，约占总土地百分之四十。现全区已锄完头遍，大部村庄的二遍已锄完了六分之一。据群众反映，点种和耩种的又好锄又省工，但又产生了些新缺点，即耩种的苗儿留的密，还有点种的不知间苗。积肥也有相当成绩，据不完全统计，全区已挖厕所九百三十一个。目前正在打蒿期间，大力开展了压绿肥运动，打下明年施肥的基础。到秋收时还准备大力领导秋耕，改造当地群众保守的农作习惯。"

By the second half of May, the situation had seriously developed in eleven villages in the first, fourth, third, fifth, and seventh districts. Statistics from ten villages showed that 630 people suffered from smallpox and chickenpox, and 296 people suffered from measles. In order to extinguish the disease disasters, the county leadership issued a call to organize doctors from various districts to rush to the villages for emergency treatment. As a result, only a little less than 3% of the 926 patients died, and the disease disasters have now been basically extinguished.\n    [Another dispatch] In order to unite medical personnel, the Fourth District of Wanping specially convened a symposium of doctors from the entire district, which determined: (1) To restore the Medical Association, divided into four groups, to organize all the doctors in the district. (2) Doctors should elect representatives to participate in the People's Representative Conference and boldly put forward their opinions. (3) Put aside the past airs of doctors and be available whenever needed for consultations. (4) Use more folk remedies and less herbal medicine to reduce the expenses of the masses. (5) Conduct health education for the masses. After the meeting, all the doctors actively returned to their villages to treat the masses.\n    [Another dispatch] In order to strengthen medical work and protect the health of the people, the Wanxian Medical Research Association opened the first medical training class on the 17th of last month. Twenty-eight trainees graduated from the school on the 3rd of this month. Five of them from the fifth and sixth districts have already rushed to the front lines with stretcher teams. The remaining trainees from various districts have also gone to the countryside for internships or are awaiting orders to support the front.\n    [Another dispatch] Some villages in Yangyuan have discovered a rash disease. In the Shoushan Village of the First District, fourteen people were ill, and seven died within three days. After the government discovered this, it organized doctors to carry out treatment. The disease disaster has now been relatively alleviated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 涞水等地　组织医生扑灭病灾\n\n1948-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：卫生常识\n\n　　涞水等地\n  　组织医生扑灭病灾\n    【察哈尔电】涞水组织医生救治病灾。今年开春以来，涞水各区即有个别村庄小孩发生流鼻血、天花、麻疹等病，至五月后半月，一、四、三、五、七区有十一个村严重发展。十个村统计，患天花、水痘的六百三十人，患麻疹的二百九十六人。县领导上为扑灭病灾，特号召组织各区医生赴各村急治。使九百二十六个病人只死亡百分之三弱，目前病灾已基本扑灭。\n    【又讯】宛平四区为团结医务人材，特召开全区医生座谈会，确定：（一）恢复医联会，分四个小组，把全区所有医生都组织起来。（二）医生选代表参加人民代表会，有意见大胆提出。（三）放下过去医生的架子，有病随请随到。（四）多用偏方、少吃草药，减少群众开支。（五）对群众进行卫生教育。会后各医生都积极回村给群众治病。\n    【又讯】完县为加强医务工作，保障人民健康，县医务研究会于上月十七日开办了第一期医训班。受训者二十八名，本月三日毕业出校后，五六区已有五人随担架队赶赴前线。其余各区学员也分头下乡实习或待命支前。\n    【又讯】阳原有些村发现疹子病，一区兽山村就病了十四人，三天内死七人。政府发现后，组织医生进行治疗，现病灾已较减轻。"

    "content": "【Taiyue Telegram】 The mutual aid group led by Wang Canghai in Yangshu Village, Sixth District of Yangcheng, has persisted for more than four years, from 1944 to the present, and is very solid. This group is so solid because it has four advantages: (1) Voluntary participation and free withdrawal. Every year, a few people leave and join the group, but everyone always chooses Wang Canghai as the leader. During this year's mutual aid rectification, five new families joined. They all said: We have long been interested in your group; you, old man, treat people so well. This year, the group has a total of thirteen families. Their crops are always planted first in every season, and everyone says it is good. (2) The leader consults with everyone on matters, and after a decision is made, the group leader supervises the execution, without coercion or drifting along. For example, when weeding seedlings, everyone discussed the method of allocating labor. It was decided that Wang Dehua's plot was large, so ten people were assigned; Zhang Xiaomeng only had three mu, so three people were assigned. The group leader executed accordingly, and no one had any objections. (3) Work is recorded based on the type of task, and accounts are settled by season. There are two methods for recording work: one is to fix work points based on the length of labor time; the other is to flexibly calculate work points based on the amount of work done. Generally, harvesting wheat, sowing seeds, weeding seedlings, etc., are all fixed work points based on time. One day is divided into three shifts: from early morning to mealtime is one shift, from after breakfast to before lunch is one shift, and from after lunch to dark is one shift, with three shifts totaling one work point. Heavy work such as carrying manure and wheat is recorded based on the type of work. First, the distance of the land is calculated, and the number of trips that can be carried in a day is determined. Only those who carry enough trips can get full work points; those who do not carry enough cannot get full work points. Work accounts are settled every year according to the seasons of spring plowing, weeding, and wheat harvesting. On July 6, after the wheat harvesting and sowing were completed, the work accounts were immediately settled. (4) The group leader can think of everything for the members, and everyone deeply recognizes that the mutual aid group is to seek benefits for themselves. Zhang Guocai's family had difficulty eating grain, but he was embarrassed to ask. Wang Canghai saw his thoughts and said: \"Our group will solve it for you.\" He managed to borrow four dou of grain for him. At the same time, he solved the difficulty of not having food for two other families. He himself is a military dependent and never allows the village to allocate labor to give him preferential treatment. In addition to doing his own work, he also works extra. Group member Zhang Guoxian said: \"Old man Canghai, as the group leader, is diligent in speaking, diligent in walking, unselfish, and treats people well.\" The group members all feel that mutual aid is for themselves, and mutual aid is gradually consolidated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 真正实行自愿等价　王仓海组坚持四年\n\n1948-07-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　真正实行自愿等价\n  　王仓海组坚持四年\n    【太岳电】阳城六区杨恕村王仓海领导的互助小组，从一九四四年到现在，坚持了四年多，非常巩固。这个组能够这么巩固，是因为有四个好处：（一）自愿参加，自由退出。每年有三三两两的人出组进组，但大家总是选王仓海当组长。今年整顿互助时，有五家又新参加了。他们都说：我们早就看中你这个组，你老汉待人就是好。该组今年共有十三家，庄稼做得季季在先，人人说好。（二）领导上有事和大家商量，决定了就由组长监督去做，不强迫命令，也不自流。如锄苗时大家讨论拨工办法，决定王德华的地块大，拨十个人；张小孟只有三亩，拨三个人；组长照着执行，谁也没有意见。（三）按活计工，按季算帐。记工办法有两种：一种按劳动时间长短固定计工；一种是按活做的多少灵活计工。一般的割麦、点种、锄苗等都是按时固定计工，一天分为三晌，清早到饭时顶一晌，早饭后到午饭前顶一晌，午饭后到天黑顶一晌，三晌共顶一工。作担粪担麦等重活是按活记工，先按地的远近，计算一天能担几回，担够回数才能顶全工，不够就不能顶全工。每年按春耕、锄苗、割麦等季节清算工帐。七月六日割麦点种完了，马上就清算了工帐。（四）组长能为组员处处设想，大家都深刻认了互助组就是为自己谋利益。张国才家里吃粮困难，但不好意思张口，王仓海看出他的心思，就说：“咱组里给你解决”。设法给他借了四斗谷子。同时解决了另外两家没吃的困难。他本人是个军属，从来不让村里拨工优待，除干了自己的活，还要长工。组员张国贤说：“仓海老汉当组长就是嘴勤、腿勤、不自私，待人好”。组员们都感到互助是为了自己，互助逐步巩固了。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Eastern Henan Front, 22nd: Frontline reporters report the following account of the victory in the Eastern Henan Campaign: The day after the People's Liberation Army proactively withdrew from Kaifeng in search of battle opportunities—on the night of June 27th—it launched a large-scale attack on the District Shou Nian Corps, which was reinforcing Kaifeng from southwestern Shandong, with lightning speed along the Sui County-Qi County line. By dusk on the 28th, the corps headquarters and the entire 75th Division were surrounded in the Longwangdian, Changlangtun, Yuxiangpu, Hezhentun, Yangguai, Qiutun and other areas northwest of Sui County. The enemy's New 21st Brigade was surrounded in Lulunji and Chenxiaolou north of Sui County, and the enemy's entire 72nd Division was surrounded in and around Tiefo Temple (north of Sui County), completing the entire encirclement of the corps. The enemy panicked and dug fortifications, attempting to resist stubbornly. The all-out annihilation battle began on the 28th. By July 1st, the entire 6th Brigade of the 75th Division and the entire New 21st Brigade had been annihilated. On the evening of the 1st, the heroic People's Liberation Army offered the most brilliant gift for the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party—a joint assault on the District Shou Nian Corps headquarters, where the 75th Division headquarters was located, in Longwangdian. Amid the deafening roar of artillery, the PLA assault troops bravely broke through the enemy's barricades, trenches, walls, and fortifications, rushing into the enemy's positions, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, destroying the enemy's tanks and flamethrowers, and resolutely completing the task of crushing the enemy's multiple counterattacks. After eight hours of fierce fighting, the battle was resolved by dawn on the 2nd, and the entire District Shou Nian Corps headquarters and the 75th Division headquarters were annihilated, capturing over 5,000 officers and soldiers, including District Shou Nian and Shen Chengnian. On the night of the 3rd, the PLA again attacked the 16th Brigade of the 75th Division, which remained in Yuxiangpu and other places. By the 4th, all the enemies in that area were eliminated. By this point, excluding the 72nd Division, approximately 20,000 troops of the District Shou Nian Corps had been completely annihilated. The PLA had achieved a decisive victory in this campaign. On the afternoon of the 1st, the Nationalist army's eastern route reinforcements, the Huang Botao Corps' entire 25th Division and the 3rd Rapid Column, and the 2nd Traffic Police Corps arrived in the northeastern area of Sui County, only a dozen miles away from the besieged 71st Division at Tiefo Temple. The PLA, moving with great speed, surrounded the entire Huang Corps in Changqiudian (over 20 miles northeast of Sui County) and the surrounding villages from the evening of the 2nd to dawn on the 3rd, and launched an offensive against the area with thunderous force. By the 5th, four regiments, one company, and part of the Traffic Police Corps had been annihilated, with over 3,500 enemy troops captured.\n    From the first day of this campaign, another powerful unit of the PLA was blocking the Nationalist army's western route reinforcements, the Qiu Qingquan Corps' entire 5th Army and the entire 83rd Division, in the Qi County area, killing and wounding over 8,000 enemy soldiers in ten days. By the afternoon of the 6th, when the PLA proactively withdrew from the battle, the enemy reinforcements were still blocked along the Xugang-Sumugang line east, west, and south of Qi County, over 40 miles away from Tiefo Temple, the besieged location of the enemy's entire 72nd Division.\n    During this campaign, in addition to the aforementioned enemy reinforcements from the east and west, Chiang Kai-shek also transferred the 41st Division of the 47th Army and the 1st Cavalry Brigade of the Sun Zhen Corps from Zhengzhou to the east, and transferred the entire 18th Army, the entire 11th Division, the entire 3rd Division, the entire 28th Division, and the entire 20th Division of the Hu Lian Corps from southern Henan, crossing the Sha River via Shangcai and other places to reinforce the north. The enemy's eastern, western, and southern route reinforcements totaled over 270,000 troops, but all were subjected to annihilation and severe casualties by the PLA blocking forces. Although Chiang Kai-shek dispatched a large number of aircraft to bomb and strafe day and night, and personally flew over the eastern Shandong battlefield to supervise the battle, the result was a loss of over 50,000 troops within ten days. From the PLA's commencement of the offensive on Kaifeng on June 16th to the end of the Eastern Henan Campaign, in just half a month, approximately 90,000 Nationalist troops were annihilated, creating an unprecedented victory since the PLA entered the Central Plains.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫东大捷经过\n\n1948-07-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫东大捷经过\n    【新华社豫东前线二十二日电】前线记者报导豫东大捷经过称：解放军为寻求战机主动撤出开封的次日——六月二十七日夜，即以迅雷不及掩耳的行动，在睢县祀县一线，向自鲁西南增援开封的区寿年兵团大举出击。二十八日黄昏，即将区兵团部与整七十五师分别包围于睢县西北龙王店、常郎屯、榆厢铺、何祯屯、杨拐、邱屯等地区，将敌新二十一旅包围于睢县北卤仑集、陈小楼，将敌整七十二师包围于铁佛寺（睢县北）及其周围地区，完成了对该兵团的全部大包围，敌人慌做一团，挖掘工事，企图顽抗。二十八日大歼灭战即宣告展开，至七月一日止，先后歼灭七十五师第六旅全部，及新二十一旅全部。一日晚英勇的人民解放军，给中国共产党的生日贡献了最精采的礼物——会攻敌区寿年兵团部，即七十五师师部所在地的龙王店。在震耳欲聋的大炮怒吼声中，解放军攻击部队奋勇突破敌人鹿砦、壕沟、围墙、工事，冲入敌人阵地，展开白刃肉搏，摧毁敌坦克、火焰喷射器的顽抗，坚决完成打垮敌人多次反冲锋，经八小时激战，至二日拂晓解决战斗，全部歼灭区寿年兵团司令部及整七十五师师部，生俘区寿年、沈澄年等以下官兵五千余人。三日夜，解放军又对残存在榆厢铺等地的七十五师十六旅进行攻击，四日将该地之敌全部解决，至此区寿年兵团所部除七十二师外，约二万人均被干净彻底消灭，解放军已取得这一战役中的决定性胜利。一日下午，蒋军东路援兵黄伯韬兵团之整二十五师、第三快速纵队，交通警察第二总队到达睢县东北地区，与被围铁佛寺之整七十一师相距只十余里。运动神速的解放军，乃于二日晚到三日拂晓，又将黄兵团全部包围于常邱店（睢县东北二十余里）及其附近各村，并以雷霆之势，进攻该地。至五日止，先后歼其四个团一个连及交警总队一部，共生俘敌三千五百余人。\n    此次战役从开始第一天起，解放军另部强大部队就在祀县地区阻击蒋军西路援兵邱清泉兵团之整五军与整八十三师，十日内毙伤该敌八千余名。至六日下午，解放军主动撤出战斗时，援敌仍被阻于祀县东西及南面许岗苏木岗一线，距敌整七十二师被围攻地点铁佛寺尚有四十余里。\n    在此次战役中，除上述蒋敌东西两路援兵外，蒋介石还从郑州抽调孙震兵团之四十七军第四十一师及骑一旅东援，自豫南抽调胡琏兵团之整十八军、整十一师、整三师、及整二十八师、整二十师等部经上蔡等地渡沙河北援。敌东、西、南各路援兵，共达二十七万余众，但均遭解放军阻击部队的歼灭与严重杀伤。蒋介石虽派大批飞机日夜轰炸扫射，并亲自乘机飞鲁东战场上空督战，结果十天内损兵折将达五万余人。自解放军六月十六日开始进攻开封至豫东战役结束，前后仅半个月，即共歼蒋军约九万人，造成解放军进入中原地区作战以来的空前最大胜利。"

    "content": "\"They Can Blockade, We Can Create!\"\n    ——A Visit to the Tongcheng Iron Factory in Xingtai City\n    Dong Ke\n    The Land Law Outline promulgated a policy protecting industry and commerce—the instructions of the Central Bureau of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu to return and compensate wrongly struggled industry and commerce were specifically implemented in Xingtai. The industrialists and businessmen in Xingtai City have recently completely stabilized their mood for running industry and commerce. Managers have begun to busy themselves with repairing their storefronts and restoring and expanding their businesses. Naliang Garden and Liping Market have built rows of brand-new market houses, becoming two bustling markets. People walking through every commercial street in Nanguan can feel a sense of new life. My visit to the Tongcheng Iron Factory deepened this fresh feeling.\n    Tongcheng was a private iron factory opened in 1943. At that time, due to various restrictions imposed by the Japanese, the factory could not develop. After liberation, with the assistance of the democratic government and bank loans, the number of workers increased from seventeen during the enemy occupation to twenty-one, and the capital increased from 30,000 yuan to 1.6 million yuan (by the end of last year). In the past, it could only manufacture waterwheels and cotton gin bows, but now it can manufacture more complex machines such as lathes and planers.\n    The manager is called Liu Wenduo. He became an apprentice blacksmith at the age of sixteen and is now over fifty years old. When I asked how the workers manufactured lathes and planers, he immediately showed a victorious smile and pulled me to the workshop to see the planer. He explained the motivation and role of manufacturing this machine, saying: \"In the second half of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang implemented strict control over hardware, prohibiting the import of various machines and parts into the Liberated Areas. The local source of flower shafts (an important part of the cotton gin) was cut off. I, along with Meng Pengzeng, Wang Xuechen, and other technical workers, began to research and manufacture the machine for making flower shafts—the planer. After the hard work of all the workers in the factory, overcoming various difficulties, we made the current planer. The effect is very good, and it can produce twenty-five flower shafts a day.\" Regarding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's blockade and control, he said: \"Chiang Kai-shek can control the iron industry in the KMT-controlled areas, but the workers in our Liberated Areas can create.\" Then he led me to another workshop to see the newly assembled lathe. Indeed, their technology is very good. The machine's small parts and body are made very exquisitely, meticulously, and smoothly. If one weren't an \"old hand,\" it would be difficult to tell that it was a \"local product.\" He holds an unshakable belief in the construction and development prospects of various industries in the Liberated Areas. He said: \"The Liberated Areas are expanding day by day, and various industrial and commercial constructions are developing day by day, requiring the manufacture of large quantities of lathes, planers, and other machines to supply industrial needs. In the future, I am willing to devote more energy to research in this area.\" He told me that he is now preparing to find raw materials for manufacturing suction beds (also a type of planer). According to him, if suction beds can be successfully manufactured, parts for various heavy industrial machines can be manufactured. He has sent people to Shijiazhuang to buy tinplate, preparing to improve and enhance the quality of the lathe.\n    He told me that he had opened the Longji Iron Factory in Xingjiawan. In 1938, the factory's buildings were burned by the Japanese, and the furniture was looted by the Xu Tieying bandit gang. He said, \"I will never forget this disaster and hatred.\" Then he frankly said that during the great movement the year before last, he saw the masses struggle against the evil gentry and feudal elements, and some industrial and commercial enterprises were also confiscated or had shares withdrawn by the masses. The three waterwheels he had deposited in Yangshi Street were also seized by the masses. At that time, he doubted and was dissatisfied with the policy, and his production mood was depressed. However, government staff constantly came to his shop to comfort and encourage him, helping him solve difficulties. The bank gave him a long-term loan of more than one million yuan to help him develop production. The government also sent people to return his three waterwheels to him. He settled down and managed the business with a free hand.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “他能封锁，咱能创造！”——邢台市同诚铁工厂访问记\n董克\n1948-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“他能封锁，咱能创造！”\n    ——邢台市同诚铁工厂访问记\n    董克\n    土地法大纲颁布了保护工商业的政策——晋冀鲁豫中央局退还与补偿错斗工商业的指示在邢台具体执行了。邢台市的工商业者们，经营工商业的情绪近来已经完全稳定起来了。经理们开始忙着修理自己的门面，恢复和扩大自己的营业。纳凉园和黎屏市场建筑了一排排崭新的市房，成为两个繁华的市场。人们走过南关每条商业街，都会感觉到一种新生的气象。我在访问同诚铁工厂时，更加深了这种新鲜的感觉。\n    同诚是民国三十二年由私人资本开办的铁工厂，当时由于日人多方限制，工厂不能发展。解放后经过民主政府与银行贷款扶助，工人由敌占时的十七人增至二十一人，资本从三万元增至一百六十万元（至去年年底），过去只能制造水车和弹花弓，现在已能自造旋床、刨床等较复杂的机器了。\n    经理叫刘闻多。他在十六岁时就当打铁学徒，现在已五十多岁了。当我问到工人们是怎样制造旋床和刨床时，他立即露出胜利的微笑，拉我到工作间去参观那张刨床。他解释制造这部机器的动机和作用说：“去年下半年，蒋匪对五金未施行严密管制，禁止各种机器及零件输入解放区。本地进花轴（弹花机重要零件）来源断绝。我和孟朋增、王学臣等技术工人便开始研究制造进花轴的机器——刨床。经过全厂工人辛苦劳作，克服了各种困难，制成了现在的刨床。效果很好，一天能出二十五根进花轴”。对蒋匪的封锁管制，他说：“蒋介石能管制蒋管区的铁工业，可是咱们解放区的工人能够创造”。接着他又领我到另一工作间去参观那张刚装配好的旋床。的确，他们的技术是很好的。机器的大小零件和机身，都做得很精巧、细致而光滑。如果不是“老在行”，真不容易看出它是一部“土产”。他对解放区各种工业的建设与发展前途，抱着一种坚定不移的信念。他说：“解放区日益扩大，各种工商业建设正日益发展，需要制造大批旋床、刨床等机器，供给工业需要。今后我愿意在这方面多费些精力来研究”。他告诉我，他现在正准备寻找制造吸床（也是一种刨床）的原料。据他说，如果吸床能制造成功，各种重工业机器的零件都可以制造出来。他已派人到石家庄去买洋铁，准备改良与提高旋床的质量。\n    他告诉我，他曾在邢家湾开办过隆记铁工厂，民国二十七年，工厂房子被日人烧了，家具被许铁英匪帮抢去了。他说：“我永远忘不了这种灾难和仇恨”。接着他又坦白的说，他在前年大运动时，看到群众斗争奸霸和封建，有些工商业也被群众没收或抽走股金，他寄存在羊市街的三辆水车也被群众扣封了，当时他对政策怀疑不满，生产情绪消沉；但政府工作人员却不断到他柜上安慰鼓励他，帮助他解决困难，银行贷给他一百多万元长期贷款，扶助他发展生产，三辆水车也由政府派人给他送回来，他安心放手的经营起来了。"

    "content": "Jizhong Electric: Since the rectification of cadres in Jizhong's agricultural experiment stations and promotion work in the first half of the year, the work enthusiasm has increased. Breaking the confines of the farms and gradually going into the countryside to combine with the masses, has achieved many successes. The various farms often use one-third or one-half of their strength to mobilize the masses outside to plant trees, control pests, soak seeds, select seeds, and hold exhibitions and symposiums, which has begun to expand the influence of the farms and take root among the masses. The Xinji Farm used eight cadres to mobilize the masses in seventeen villages, including Dadongping in Zhao County, to control pests. In more than fifty days, they treated 9,714 mu of pear orchards, so that more than 2,300 pear trees that could not produce pears this year can be expected to bear fruit next year (if not treated, they will not bear fruit for three years). Other orchards with more serious insect pests can also harvest 70% this year; those with less severe pests can expect a bumper harvest. The Yunbaishan Farm promoted 7,186 jin of various improved cotton seeds, 15,949 jin of various grain seeds, 235,000 strains of various yam seedlings, and 189 jin of indigo in 118 villages in nine counties. They personally soaked seeds for 78 households, leading 32 households to soak 589 jin of seeds. They selected wheat seeds for 430 households, leading 34 households to select 2,220 shi (equivalent to 2,410 jin). They treated 9,736 mu of pear orchards for pear insects, 12,264 plants for jujube curculio oil insects; planted 35,776 trees, removed 134,800 diseased wheat plants (220 jin) of various kinds, treated 43 mu of wheat armyworms, 4 mu of wheat fire beetles, 29.5 mu of persimmon aphids, and treated 63 head of livestock. When the Jizhong Administrative Office's Agricultural and Forestry Department held a farm meeting in the last ten days of last month, in addition to summarizing the above achievements, it also examined many shortcomings in the work: such as some farms lacking investigation and research and a long-term implementation spirit in the promotion process, considering the seeds promoted to be the end of the matter, lacking inspection and follow-up, etc. At the same time, it was determined to combine indigenous methods with foreign methods, technology with the masses, and farms with administration. Those promoted must be inspected; the five major insect pests must be prevented and controlled in an organized and focused manner (cotton aphids and fire spiders in the 9th and 11th districts, grain armyworms in the 8th district, vegetable worms and pear insects in the 9th district, etc.). Secondly, seed selection for grains, corn, sorghum, etc. should be carried out during the autumn harvest, and seed soaking should be carried out when planting wheat. The promotion of technical work should focus on using organized mutual aid and cooperative societies, and organizing the masses through technology. Without experimentation and without 100% certainty, random promotion is not allowed, and the crops of the masses cannot be used for experimentation at will.\n    [Another News] The 26 members of the Jizhong Administrative Office's Promotion Team departed on the 4th of this month for Jin County in the 11th District and Li County in the 9th District, etc., to promote pest control work in the cotton-growing areas. They plan to draw one person from each promotion station in the counties of the 9th and 11th districts to work and train cadres at the same time. After learning the treatment methods, they will return to their original stations to mobilize local pest control.\n    [Another News] As the rainy season is approaching, in order to test afforestation in the rainy season, a team from the afforestation team went to Bieying, Hejian, to test afforestation in saline-alkali land. Another team went to Ningjin to cooperate with the local government and Xinji Farm to carry out afforestation work in the rainy season based on existing habits.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中农林工作与群众相结合\n\n1948-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中农林工作与群众相结合\n    【冀中电】冀中上半年的农事试验场及推广工作，由于农场干部整党后工作情绪提高，打破了农场的圈子，逐步深入农村与群众结合，已获得不少成绩。各场经常以三分之一或二分之一的力量在外发动群众植树、治虫、浸种、选种、开展览会、座谈会，开始扩大了农场影响，在群众中扎下了根。辛集农场以八个干部在赵县大东平等十七村发动群众治虫，五十多天治了九千七百一十四亩地的梨虫，使今年不能收梨的二千三百多株梨树，明年可望结果（如不治，三年不结果），其他虫灾较重的，今年也能收七成；灾轻的可望丰收。云白山农场，在九个县一一八村推广各种优良棉籽七千一百八十六斤，各种谷种一万五千九百四十九斤，各种山药秧二十三万五千株，蓝靛一百八十九斤。亲自给群众浸种七十八户，带动三十二户，浸种五百八十九斤。给群众选小麦种四三○户，带动三十四户，选了二二二○石（合二四一○斤）。治梨虫九千七百三十六亩，枣步曲油虫一二二六四株；植树三五七七六株，拔除小麦各种病株十三万四千八百株（二百二十斤），麦黏虫四十三亩，麦火蚶子四亩，柿蚜二十九亩半，医治牲口六十三头。上月下旬冀中行署农林厅召开农场会议时，除总结上述成绩外，并检查了工作中不少缺点：如有些场在推广中缺乏调查研究和长期贯彻的精神，种子推出去就算完事，缺乏检查跟进等。同时确定要将土法与洋法相结合，技术与群众相结合，农场与行政相结合。对推广出去的要检查；要有组织有重点的防除五大虫害（九、十一分区的棉蚜、火蛛子，八专区的谷黏虫，九分区的菜虫、梨虫等）。其次是在大秋时应进行谷、玉米、高粱等选种，种麦时浸种。技术工作的推广，要着重运用组织起来的互助合作社，通过技术把群众组织起来。没试验过，没十成把握的，不准随便推广，不能拿着群众的庄稼随便作试验。\n    【又讯】冀中行署推广队二十六人，于本月四日分赴十一专区晋县、九专蠡县等棉区推广除虫工作。他们计划从九、十一专区各县推广场各抽一人，一面工作，一面训练干部，把治法学会后各回原场，在当地发动治虫。\n    【又讯】雨季将到，为试雨季造林，造林队一组赴河间行别营试行碱地造林。另一组到宁晋配合当地政府及辛集农场在旧有习惯上开展雨季造林工作。"

First, add three jin of water and soak for half a day. Then, remove the residue and add another fifty jin of clean water to spray on the trees.\n\n(2) Mix four liang of lime with two jin of water to make lime water. Then, add four liang of sulfur and simmer over a fire for about an hour until it turns yellowish-brown. Remove the residue and add two hundred jin of water to spray on the trees. Note that a steel pot should not be used for simmering. Stir constantly while simmering to prevent sedimentation.\n\n(3) There is a kind of herbal medicine, commonly known as Baibuzi. Crush its tubers, mix with water, and spray on the trees.\n\n(4) Pile soil more than one chi high around the base of the tree, and use an iron hoe to smooth it, making it as steep as possible. Before dawn, while the insects are weakened from the overnight dew and their adhesion is poor, use a large wooden stick to knock on the roots of the tree. The insects will be shaken off, and then killed. For those that are not completely removed, they will be unable to climb back up the tree due to the smooth soil pile around the roots.\n\nThe above methods have all been successfully tested.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫八专署介绍杀枣树虫法\n\n1948-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫八专署介绍杀枣树虫法\n    冀鲁豫区清丰、内黄一带产枣区，近来枣树上多生“射虹”虫（俗名“八角”），对枣树为害很大。八专署建设科常流等同志经过研究，介绍了除虫办法如下：（一）用十两生石灰、四两烟粉混在一起，先加水三斤，泡半天以后，取出渣子，再加净水五十斤，喷在树上。（二）用石灰四两，加水二斤，制成石灰水，再加硫磺四两，用火熬一小时许，等成黄土色时，取出渣子，加水二百斤喷射树上，但注意熬时不要用钢锅，随熬随搅，不要使之沉淀。（三）有一种草药，俗名白埠子，将它的块根弄碎，用水调和，喷在树上。（四）围着树根堆一尺多高的土，用铁铣拍光，越陡越好，天明以前，趁虫子受一夜露水打，伸缩和胶涩力不强的时候，用大木棍敲打树根，虫子便可震下，然后打死，打不净的，因树根有光土堆，它也无力再爬上树去。以上几种方法都是经过试验成功的。"

    "content": "[Special Dispatch] According to a comrade from the Civil Affairs and Production Section of the North China Bureau who spoke to our reporter: The main characteristic of the recent period in agricultural production in various regions is the end of severe drought and the entry into the rainy season, striving for replanting and rush planting. Although rain has now fallen thoroughly and universally, it is late in the season, and coupled with other disasters, the situation is still not optimistic. Party and government leading organs must still pay serious and close attention. Southern Chahar and Northern Shanxi suffered severe hailstorms, with a considerable area affected. Locusts have been found in northern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Hebei, some of which have been eradicated, while others are still developing. In areas such as the Northern Heng Mountains and the Taihang Mountains, there have been four consecutive days of overcast weather, turning from drought to flooding. In Laishui, much land has been washed away by water, and some rivers in central Hebei have overflowed, with the flood-affected area gradually expanding. Other problems such as insect pests and human and animal epidemics are quite prevalent. These situations are of greatest concern to people of all levels, and the Party and government have been and are taking measures to provide emergency relief with all their might, so as not to affect the autumn harvest. However, whether the expected results can be achieved depends on the degree to which leading organs at all levels implement and carry out these measures. The Party committees of various districts under the North China Central Bureau are rapidly understanding the agricultural situation in various regions and sending special personnel to inspect and investigate in various places, strengthening leadership over production. Southern Hebei and other places use telephones to collect information from the prefectural committees, and the Taiyue District Party Committee collects weekly information from various places, using news agencies to report to the Central Bureau in a timely manner. These are all very good and necessary measures, worthy of promotion in various places.\n\nPaying attention to grasping the constantly changing agricultural situation by party and government leading organs is the most important link in leading production. In Shulu, which suffered from hailstorms, thanks to the timely leadership of the Party and government, 20,000 mu of land have now been replanted. After the hailstorm in Hunyuan, all cadres went to the countryside to form work teams to lead the masses in emergency rescue, and preliminary success has now been achieved. In Anyang, northern Henan, locust nymphs caused damage, and the Party and government led the people to quickly exterminate them, saving ten thousand mu of farmland. In this way, the serious disaster was finally overcome with the efforts of all the people. Conversely, there are also individual Party and government leading organs that only put forward empty slogans or plans for \"great production,\" without checking the degree of implementation, without truly helping the masses to actually fight. They even think that \"farmers know how to produce and do not need leadership.\" Therefore, after the plan, they put the leadership of production aside, and as for what new situations have occurred in the people's production and what countermeasures should be taken to adapt to these situations, they do not ask or care. This is the worst form of bureaucratic leadership.\n\nFor example, this year, when hoeing seedlings in the summer, barren land was found in the Northern Heng Mountains and southern Shanxi, but the reasons for the barren land were unknown, when it became barren, and how to eliminate it. The wheat harvest in the Taiyue District this year was better than in previous years, but many counties suffered from yellow jaundice and black jaundice, resulting in a large reduction in harvest. Yicheng County alone reduced production by 40%. Why did jaundice disease spread so much in this county this year? Why didn't they shout loudly in time and try every means to eliminate it with all their might? What are the countermeasures for next year...? These have not been thoroughly checked and seriously reviewed to this day. This year, the most jujube trees in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area are infested with insects. The reason is that those that produced a lot last year produce a lot this year, and those that did not produce last year have also spread this year, which shows that the jujube tree insect infestation last year did not attract the attention of the leadership. There were reports of jujube tree insect pests in this area as early as January this year, but it was not until now that the administrative office sent people to assist in the treatment, resulting in a loss of jujubes worth more than 10,000 shi of millet.\n\nNow, although the drought has been swept away in various places, the drought in some areas cannot be completely saved, and many new problems are occurring again. For example, after continuous heavy rains, what is the flood situation in various places? Has effective prevention been paid attention to? Summer epidemics are prevalent in various places, and many people and animals are suffering from diseases. Have efforts been concentrated to eliminate them? After the heavy rain, many canals and field roads were washed away. How to repair them? Farmers urgently demand autumn planting. How should the leadership try to coordinate, organize markets, and mobilize cooperative stores to help agricultural production? How should relief be carried out in severely affected areas? Many new problems urgently need the Party and government to lead and solve them, and they cannot be allowed to develop on their own. It is necessary to break the bureaucratic method of sitting in a room waiting for the weather to clear before holding a meeting to deploy production. Because, in the blink of an eye, the Beginning of Autumn is only half a month away, and time is very tight. It is necessary to immediately mobilize, go deep into the countryside to discover various situations, and seriously solve problems. A slight delay will cause irreparable losses to this year's autumn harvest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 及时检查了解农业状况　不失时机克服灾荒\n\n1948-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　及时检查了解农业状况\n  　不失时机克服灾荒\n    【本报特讯】据华北局民运生产科某同志告记者称：最近一时期，各地农业生产状况主要特点是结束苦旱进入雨季，争取补种抢种。现虽已普遍落透雨，但时间已晚，加之其他灾害，仍不可乐观。党政领导机关仍必须严重密切注意。察南雁北曾遭严重雹灾，受灾面相当宽。豫北冀南冀西先后发现蝗虫，有的已经扑灭，有的尚在发展。北岳太行等地连阴四日，由旱转涝，涞水不少土地被水冲走，冀中有些河水已经出漕，水灾区逐渐扩张。其他如虫害，人畜瘟疫颇为流行。这些情况为各阶层人民所最为关心，党和政府已经并正在设法全力急救，使其不致影响秋季收成。但是否能达到预期的效果，还需看各级领导机关执行和贯彻的程度如何来决定。华北中央局所属各区党委都在迅速了解各地农业情况，派专人在各地巡视考察。加强对生产领导。冀南等地用电话搜集地委情况，太岳区党委搜集各地每周情况，利用通讯社向中央局及时汇报。这些都是很好的十分必要的措施，值得各地推广。党政领导机关注意掌握经常在变化的农业状况，是领导生产的最重要一环。束鹿遭雹灾，由于党和政府及时领导，现在有两万亩地重新播种；浑源雹灾后，干部全体下乡组成工作队领导群众紧急抢救，现已初步获得成功。豫北安阳蝗蝻为害，党和政府领导人民迅速扑灭，救活田禾万亩。这样，使严重灾情，终于在全体人民努力之下得以战胜；相反的，还有个别的党和政府领导机关，只是空洞的提出了“大生产”的口号或计划，不去检查执行的程度，不去真正帮助群众实际起来进行斗争。甚至以为“生产农民会干，不必领导”。因而在计划之后，便把生产领导搁在一旁，至于人民生产中发生了些什么新的情况以及适应这些情况应该采取一些什么对策，更是不闻不问，这是领导生产的最坏的官僚主义。例如，今年在夏季锄苗的时候，北岳翼南等地均发现了荒地，但不知道荒地的原因，何时荒的以及如何消灭荒地。太岳区今年麦收比往年好，可是有不少县苦于黄疸黑疸而收成大减，只翼城一县即减产百分之四十，该县今年疸病为什么如此蔓延？为什么没有及时大声疾呼，想尽一切办法全力扑灭？明年的对策为何………这些至今都没有详细检查和认真检讨。冀鲁豫今年枣树生虫最多，推其原因凡是去年生得多的今年都多，去年没生的今年也普遍蔓延，这说明去年枣树虫害并没有引起领导上注意。该区今年枣树虫害，在一月以前即有消息报导，可是至今才见到行署派人去协助救治，结果已经损失相当万余石小米价值的枣子。现在，各地旱象虽已扫除，但有些地区的旱灾已经不能完全挽救，且有很多新的问题又在发生，譬如在连绵大雨后各地汛情如何？是否已经注意了有效的防范？各地夏疫流行，人畜害病很多，是否集中力量予以扑灭？大雨后，水渠及田地道路被冲坏很多，如何补修？农民迫切要求秋种，领导上应如何设法调剂，组织集市，动员合作社商店帮助农业生产？受灾严重地区应如何进行救济？许多新问题急待党和政府努力领导解决，不可任其自流，必须打破坐在屋子里等待天晴后再开会布置生产的官僚主义的方法。因为，眼看还有半个月就是立秋，时间十分紧迫。必须立即动员，深入乡村去发现各种情况，认真解决问题。稍有遗误，便会造成今年秋收不可挽救的损失。"

    "content": "【Taiyue Telegraph】On the first day of our march into Jinzhong, we saw streets in a certain town in ×× County filled with rows of lacquered chests, cabinets, and furniture, stretching continuously for more than eighty li to Songshudian. A landlord in Mianshang Village told me that these pieces of furniture were brought by refugees who had fled from Pingyao and Jiexiu in the past. They were forced to flee into the mountains by Yan Xishan, using chests to exchange for food. There were over two hundred refugees living here, and they had been waiting for our troops for a long time. During a night march to a ridge thirty li away from Pingyao, in the clear moonlight, we could clearly see groups of villagers around us, carrying pots, leading donkeys, and pulling their children, happily following the troops home. They shouted along the way, \"Make way, let our troops pass first!\" They also comforted their children, saying, \"Our troops are here, they will drive away the Gouzi troops (referring to Yan's bandits), and we can eat noodles when we go home.\"\n　　When the troops arrived at a large courtyard in Caozigou, two old men came out to complain, saying, \"The Gouzi (Yan's bandits) came this morning to rob grain and cotton. Look at what they have done to our homes! It's so good that our troops have arrived.\" When the troops arrived at Liangjiatan, an old lady, upon seeing the troops, immediately said, \"You've finally come! The people have been thinking about the troops so much that they're almost going crazy. The wheat isn't even fully ripe, but the Gouzi township government has already assigned grain quotas. My family can harvest three shi, but the Gouzi has assigned three shi and five.\" She eagerly wanted the troops to go to her house. Before even entering the gate, she anxiously told her daughter-in-law, \"Prepare to harvest the wheat tomorrow, our troops are here!\" She then muttered to herself, \"We still have to steal to harvest our own wheat, the Gouzi are really killing people.\" Yan's bandits had issued an order here that anyone who harvested wheat privately would be beheaded. An old man in Yanjinggou was beheaded for harvesting wheat on his own land, and his head was displayed as a warning.\n　　When the troops attacked the Duling stronghold, there were four to five hundred villagers inside who had been captured by Yan's bandits. Yan's bandits forced them to be the vanguard, but they risked life and limb to run over to our side. They were all sallow and emaciated, and said to the soldiers as if seeing their own family, \"If you had attacked a few days later, we would have starved to death!\" After the battle was resolved, the rooms and courtyards were filled with people, all vying to see that \"Major General Commander Xu Ziliang.\" Several old men requested the soldiers, \"Give us more victories to vent our hatred!\" Villagers from Xialing said, \"These guys (Yan's army) have raped all our young women, beaten people, robbed grain, and conscripted soldiers. They have really made people suffer.\" They insisted on taking the prisoners, but the soldiers explained to them that they should be treated according to the policy on prisoners of war. Only then did they give up.\n　　As the troops advanced towards Jiexiu, the roadside was filled with yellow wheat fields as far as the eye could see. Many people are now harvesting wheat in the fields, and they smiled happily as they watched the troops pass.\n　　【Beiyue News】On July 9th, the Yan bandit security police brigade stationed in Donghuangshui, Yangqu Third District, was routed by our main force. The bandit battalion commander led fifty men and attempted to flee to Fanzhuang. They were intercepted by our local militia, who wounded two enemies, seized three light cannons, four rifles, and twenty-one grenades. The enemy scattered in a panic.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Xing Shuxing, Chen Guihuai).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 多打胜仗出出恨气！　晋中群众热爱我军\n\n1948-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　多打胜仗出出恨气！\n  　晋中群众热爱我军\n    【太岳电】我们向晋中进军的头一天，看见××县某镇街上摆满了一列列的油漆箱柜家具，一直到松树店八十多里的路上，连绵不断。绵上村一位房东告诉我说：这些家具都是过去从平遥、介休逃来的难民带来的。他们叫阎锡山逼得没法，跑上山来拿箱子换粮食，这里就住着二百多难民，他们已经等咱队伍好长时间了。夜行军到离平遥三十里的一个山岭上，清亮的月光下清晰的可以看到我们行列的前后左右都是三五成群的老乡，他们担着锅子，赶着毛驴，拉着孩子，高兴的跟着队伍回家。他们一路上叫喊着：“让开路，让咱的队伍先走。”还不时的安慰自己的孩子道：“咱的队伍来了，把勾子军（指阎匪）打走了，咱回家就能吃面啦”。\n    队伍到了草子沟一所大院里，两个老汉出来诉苦，他说：“勾子（阎匪）今天清早还来抢粮食棉花，你看家里被翻腾成个啥啦！咱队伍来的可好。”队伍到了梁家滩，一位老太太见了部队，头一句就说：“你们可来了，老百姓想着队伍都快想疯了。麦子还没黄透，勾子乡公所就派下粮来，我家能收三石，勾子就派了三石五。”她争着要队伍到她家去，还没进大门，她就着急的告诉她媳妇说：“明天准备割麦吧，咱的队伍来啦！”她又自言自语道：“自家的麦还得偷着割，勾子真把人害死啦。”阎匪在这里下过命令，谁家要私自割麦，就要杀头。阎井沟就有个老汉因为上自己地割麦子被砍了头，还号令示众。\n    队伍打都岭据点时，里面有被阎匪抓去的四五百老乡，阎匪强迫他们当头阵，但他们却冒着枪林弹雨跑过来了。他们一个个都是面黄饥瘦，象见了亲人似的对战士们说：“你们再迟打几天，我们就饿死了！”战斗解决以后，房里院里都挤满了人，争着要那位“少将司令徐子良”，有几个老汉向战士们要求：“给我们多打几个胜仗，出出恨气！”下岭老乡说：“这些家伙（阎军）把我们年轻女人都强奸遍了，打人、抢粮、抓兵，真把人害苦了。”他们一定要求把俘虏交给他们，但战士们给他们解释了应当按俘虏政策对待。他们才不要了。\n    队伍向介休挺进时，沿路上一片黄麦田，一眼看不到边，现在很多人正在地里割麦，他们看着队伍走过，都高兴的笑了。\n    【北岳讯】七月九日，驻阳曲三区东黄水之阎匪保警大队。经我主力击溃后，匪营长带领五十余人，企图往范庄逃跑。中途被我当地民兵阻击，计伤敌二名，缴获轻炮三门，步枪四支，手榴弹二十一个，敌仓慌四散。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（邢书兴，陈贵槐）。"

    "content": "[Chahar Electric Dispatch] Heavy hail disasters have struck various parts of Southern Chahar. In Wei County, the crops in the mountain areas of the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth districts have suffered considerable losses. According to statistics from nine villages, including Qiangfengya and Caozhuangzi in the thirteenth district, a total of 3,910 mu of beans, buckwheat, hemp, and special crops were lost. In Qiangfengya, losses of special crops accounted for seven-tenths of the village's total, and hemp accounted for four-tenths. All miscellaneous grains in Caozhuangzi were destroyed. Zhuolu's ninth, tenth, thirteenth, and fourteenth districts also suffered hail and flood disasters. In Xuanhua, the first, eleventh, and twelfth districts south of the Sanggan River experienced extremely severe hail disasters. According to preliminary investigations, about 5,000 mu of millet, beans, and sorghum were destroyed in thirty-three villages of varying sizes within an area more than ten li wide and sixty li long. In the east-west Jian villages of the first district alone, more than 2,000 mu were destroyed, accounting for one-half of the total land area. The Sixth Special Commissioner's Office of Northern Yue urgently allocated 1,000 shi of grain to relieve the disaster-stricken people. The Xuanhua County convened county and district cadres to study replanting measures, and dispatched special personnel to purchase a large quantity of buckwheat seeds, which were distributed to the disaster areas with a focus. A group of strong county and district cadres personally went to the disaster villages to organize the masses to rush to replant.\n\n[Another Electric Dispatch] Parts of Western Hebei have suffered hail, flood, and wind disasters. According to extremely incomplete statistics, 98 mu of land in five villages, including Tiejiao in Laishui's fourth district, were washed away on the 3rd. In the third district, 400 mu of land were washed away and 300 mu were silted up. In the Damo Ridge area of Wanping, hail fell for more than an hour on the 29th of last month, and had not completely melted by the 30th, and many crops were smashed. In Huailai's second district, hailstones damaged more than 1,000 mu of seedlings in two villages. Liangxiang suffered a hail disaster on the afternoon of the 3rd, with approximately 3,000 mu affected. In Liujiayu Village, Wanping's second district, a wind disaster on the 30th broke 635 cabbage trees, and crops were also damaged significantly. Many areas in Laishui's seventh district were also badly damaged. The masses in the disaster areas are now actively rushing to replant.\n\n[Northern Yue News] Insect and hail damage are very serious in the First Special District of Northern Yue. Recently, a kind of pest has been discovered in Lingqiu, Fanshi, Hunyuan, and Guangling. They are bright green in color, about seven or eight fen long, and specialize in eating leaves and more tender crops. The affected seedlings wither and die within five to seven days. There are more of these insects on special crops, and the damage is even worse. After this type of insect was discovered in the urban area of Fanshi, 914 people from the surrounding masses were immediately organized, under the leadership of 54 cadres, to catch them, and 563 pests were eliminated in one day. The pests near the urban area have been completely eliminated. Other parts of Northern Yanbei are also actively organizing the masses to capture them.\n\nOn June 30th, wind and hail disasters struck six counties including Guangling, Fanshi, Hunyuan, Datong, Yingxian, and Lingqiu. According to preliminary statistics, more than 150 villages were affected, and crops were severely damaged. More than 90% of special crops were destroyed, and there is little hope for most of the autumn crops. Leaders at all levels urgently instructed their subordinates to organize the masses to rush to plant and provide disaster relief, distribute loan grain and relief grain, solve seed difficulties, carry out replanting and alternative planting, and mobilize unaffected villages and households to carry out mutual assistance. After the hail disaster occurred in Hunyuan, the county immediately organized working teams to conduct in-depth investigations in the villages with serious disasters. The government provided 1,500 jin of buckwheat as replanting seeds from loan grain, and loaned 10 million yuan to solve the problem of food and bedding for the masses. Livestock was drawn from unaffected villages and organs to assist the masses in rushing to plant.\n\n(Industrial Section of the First Special Commissioner's Office)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 察南雁北风雹成重灾　政府领导群众补种\n\n1948-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　察南雁北风雹成重灾\n  　政府领导群众补种\n    【察哈尔电】察南各地遭受严重雹灾。蔚县山上十二、十三、十四三个区禾苗损失相当严重，据十三区抢风崖、曹庄子等九个村的统计，共损失豆类、荞麦、麻及特种作物三千九百一十亩。抢风崖损失特种作物占全村总数十分之七，麻占十分之四。曹庄子所有杂禾全被打毁。涿鹿九、十、十三、十四等区也遭受雹灾与水灾。宣化桑乾河以南的一、十一、十二三个区雹灾极重，据初步调查，在宽十余里、长六十余里的三十三个大小村庄内，约有五千亩谷、豆、高粱被打毁。仅一区东西间两个村，即被毁二千余亩，占总土地面积二分之一。北岳六专署急拨粮食千石，救济被灾难民。宣化县召集县区干部研究改种办法，并派专人购买大批荞麦种子，有重点的到灾区发放。并由一部坚强县区干部，亲自到灾村组织群众抢救改种。\n    【又电】平西部分地区遭受雹、水、风灾。据极不完整的统计，涞水四区铁角等五村于三号被冲毁地九十八亩。三区被冲地四百亩，被淤地三百亩。宛平达摩岭一带，上月二十九日降雹一个多钟头，至三十号尚未化完，庄禾被砸毁很多。怀来二区两个村被冰雹打坏苗子一千多亩。良乡于三日午后遭雹灾，被灾地区约三千多亩。宛平二区刘家峪村三十号被风灾，折花菜树六百三十五棵，庄稼也刮坏很多。涞水七区刮坏的也很多，现各被灾地区群众正积极突击补种。\n    【北岳讯】北岳一专虫雹为灾甚重。灵邱、繁峙、浑源、广灵各地，近日发现一种害虫，颜色鲜绿，约七八分长，专吃叶子及较柔嫩的庄稼，被害禾苗五、七日后即干枯而死。特种作物上此种虫更多，被害尤甚。繁峙城关发现这种害虫后，当即组织周围群众九百一十四人，在干部五十四人领导下进行捕捉，一天消灭害虫五百六十三个。城关附近的害虫已完全扑灭。雁北其他各地也积极组织群众捕捉中。\n    六月三十日，广灵、繁峙、浑源、大同、应县，灵邱等六县风、雹成灾。据初步统计，受灾村庄有一百五十余个，作物受害甚重，特种作物被打毁百分之九十以上，大秋作物，大部无望。各级领导上火速指示所属，组织群众抢种救灾。发放贷粮与救济粮，解决种子困难，进行补种改种，发动未受灾村未受灾户，进行互济互助。浑源于雹灾发生后，县里立即组织工作队，分赴灾情严重村庄进行深入调查，由政府拿出贷粮一千五百斤荞麦，做为改种种子，又贷款一千万元，以解决群众口粮垫铺问题。并由未受灾村及机关商号抽出牲口，协助群众进行抢种。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（一专署实业科）"

    "content": "Briefs on Industry and Commerce\n    △Handan City is located between Yuzhou and Qizhou (Anguo), the nationally renowned centers of the medicinal herb industry, and is surrounded by medicinal herb-producing areas. It serves as a hub for exchange and distribution. The democratic government has provided multifaceted support to the city's industry and commerce. In March of this year, it initiated and held a medicinal herb conference, which further developed the city's medicinal herb industry. According to June statistics, six new wholesale establishments for Chinese medicine were added, bringing the total to forty-eight (including mountain produce and medicinal herb warehouses). On average, over fifty merchants from Jiang-occupied areas such as Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Hankou, Jinan, and Anyang come to Handan to purchase medicinal herbs daily. The number of merchants coming from various liberated areas is even greater. In June, over 663,000 jin of various medicinal herbs were put on the market, with a total transaction value of over 70 million yuan (J冀钞 currency). The income of each medicinal herb merchant in June increased fivefold compared to the average of previous months before April. Since the trade relations with Sichuan and Guangdong for medicinal herbs were opened, large quantities of outside herbs have arrived, and the export volume of yams has been quite large. The previous phenomenon of incomplete medicinal herbs has been overcome. In order to accelerate the large-scale export of mountain produce and medicinal herbs, drugstores such as Dasheng and Qingsheng are preparing to establish pharmaceutical societies and research departments to process local herbs into medicinal powders and ointments for easy transportation and consumption.\n    △During the review in Feicheng last year, the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce was violated. The Xiangji Tea House was struggled against, causing panic among all industrial and commercial households in the city. During this correction, various mass and industrial and commercial household meetings were held to repeatedly conduct education on industrial and commercial policies, persuading the masses to return all of the confiscated house of Xiangji Tea House, tea worth 1.2 million J冀钞 currency, and furniture. The industrial and commercial households in the city gradually stabilized. On the first market day after the return, eight more grain shops were added. More than 180 shi were transacted, more than double the past.\n    △After returning the wrongly struggled industrial and commercial entities in Chengci Town, the government issued loans to support the development of industry and commerce. In just over two months, thirty-five new shops have been added: including four sundry goods shops, one cigarette factory, as well as oil shops, dyeing shops, pharmacies, and flour mills. Some businesses are also repairing storefronts and purchasing furniture, preparing to open and expand their business.\n    △Since the correction of deviations in Jincheng Chengguan's industry and commerce, it has gradually moved towards prosperity. The total number of established businesses and street vendors in the city has increased from 995 to 1,041. The newly added businesses are mostly small handicraft factories and workshops such as iron factories, clothing bureaus, and shoe shops. The thirty-one public and joint public-private workshops and stores have been transferred to private operation one after another. Many handicraftsmen and small factory owners are preparing to resume or expand their business.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 工商简讯\n\n1948-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　工商简讯\n    △邯郸市位于驰名全国的药业中心禹州、祁州（安国）之间，周围都是产药区，多由该市交流集散。民主政府对该市工商业多方扶植，于今年三月间倡开药材大会，会后该市药业更有发展。据六月份统计，中药业新增批发庄六家，连前共达四十八家（山货药材栈在内）。由蒋占区新乡、郑州、汉口、济南、安阳等地来邯买办药材的商人，每日平均有五十余人。由各解放区来此的商人为数更多。六月份上市的各种药材达六十六万三千余斤，交易总额在七万万元（冀钞）以上；各药商六月份的收入。比四月份以前各月平均数增加五倍。自打通川广药材贸易关系后，外面药材大批到来，山药出口为数颇大。过去药材不全的现象已经克服。为了加速山货药材大批出口，大生、庆生等药庄正筹备设制药社研究部，把土药制成药粉、药膏，便于运输服用。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（蔡光庭）\n    △肥城在去年复查时，违反了保护与发展工商业的政策，斗争了祥记茶庄，引起全城工商户的恐慌。这次纠偏时，召开各种群众和工商户会议，反复进行工商业政策教育，说服群众将没收祥记茶庄的房子，价值冀钞一百二十万元的茶叶及家具全部退回。全城工商户逐渐稳定，退还后的第一个集上，粮行就增加了八座。成交一百八十多石，超过过去一倍以上。\n    △成磁城内，退还错斗工商业后，政府又发贷款，扶植工商业发展。两个多月内，新添铺户三十五家：计有杂货铺四家，卷烟厂一家及油店、染坊、药铺、磨面坊等。还有一些商号正在修理门面，置买家具，准备开张和扩大营业。\n    △晋城城关工商业自纠偏以来，逐渐走向繁荣，全城坐商摊贩已由九百九十五家增至一千零四十一家。新增商号多为铁工厂、成衣局、鞋铺等手工业小工厂和作坊。公营和公私合营的三十一座作坊商店已先后转让给私人经营。还有不少手工业者和小工厂主都在准备复业或扩大营业。"

    "content": "[Report from Central Hebei] Xinle County has made great achievements in developing waterwheels and water conservancy since the February production conference. From February to June, according to incomplete statistics, 615 new waterwheels have been added, 330 old waterwheels have been repaired, 105 new wells have been dug, and 228 old wells have been repaired. This has greatly saved labor and increased the area of irrigated land. The reasons for these achievements are mainly the leadership's attention and the cadres' active organization and leadership. At the February production conference, the leadership emphasized the large-scale development of waterwheels and water conservancy. After the meeting, county and district cadres actively publicized and mobilized in various villages, issued large amounts of loans, and drove private capital to organize well-digging and the purchase and repair of waterwheels. The cooperative promoted loans to help iron factories build waterwheels, lending out 89 and selling 216, and also lending out more than 400 million yuan for water conservancy. Gangtou Village used floating wealth to buy 44 waterwheels, and also used confiscated trees to make some water buckets and frames. However, in the use and management of waterwheels, some villages in the county have developed serious shortcomings and biases. Some villages forcibly unified the distribution and average use of all waterwheels in the village, thus infringing on the interests of middle peasants and greatly affecting production. Last year, Song Village bought back waterwheel iron wheels and asked middle peasants to provide buckets; it was stipulated that the original waterwheels in the village would be used collectively, which caused great dissatisfaction among households with waterwheels (mainly middle peasants). Up to now, only five have been installed, and more than 30 wheels and 60 buckets are still lying in the street, unattended. After the old waterwheels were collectivized, no one repaired them, and the buckets all leaked. This kind of commandism, violating the principle of mutual assistance and voluntariness for the benefit of both, and infringing on the ownership and use rights of waterwheel owners, also exists in other villages (Zhu Village is correcting it). If this is not corrected quickly, it will inevitably affect water conservancy construction and increased production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新乐发展水车成绩大　侵犯中农利益亟须纠正\n臧成耀\n1948-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新乐发展水车成绩大\n  　侵犯中农利益亟须纠正\n    【冀中讯】新乐县自二月生产会议以来，在发展水车、开展水利上已有很大成绩。从二月至六月间，据不完全统计，已增加新水车六百一十五辆，修理旧水车三百三十辆，打新井一百零五眼，修理旧井二百二十八眼。大大节省了劳力，增加了水利面积。获到这些成绩的原因，主要是领导上的重视和干部的积极组织领导。在二月生产会议上，领导上强调提出大量发展水车，开展水利；会后县区干部又到各村积极宣传动员发放大批贷款，带动浮财私资，组织打井和购买、修理水车。推进社贷款扶助铁工厂造水车，先后贷出八十九辆，卖出二百一十六辆，另贷出水利款四万万多元。岗头村用浮财买水车四十四辆，还用没收的树木打一些水斗子和车架子。在水车的使用和管理上，该县某些村庄则产生了严重的缺点和偏向。有些村庄强制全村水车统一分配和平均使用，因而侵犯了中农的利益，使生产受到不少影响。宋村去年买回水车铁轮、让中农出斗子；规定村中原有水车归伙使用，引起有水车户（主要是中农）很不满意。到现在只按上了五辆，还有三十多辆车、六十多个斗子在街上扔着没人管。旧水车归伙后，因没人修理，斗子都漏了水。这种强迫命令、违犯互助自愿等两利的原则、侵犯水车主的所有权与使用权的现象别村也有（朱村正纠正中），如不很快纠正，势必影响水利建设和增加生产。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（臧成耀）"

On June 5th, a hail disaster occurred in 17 villages including Nanzhi Qiu, completely destroying 8,534 mu of crops and partially destroying 26,942 mu of crops. Many of the men in this area are away doing business, and there are many livestock, but there is a lack of manpower, and there are many difficulties in planting, and people's morale is very low. In order to solve the difficulty of planting in the disaster area and quickly complete planting, the Prefectural Committee transferred 120 people and 85 livestock from various organs and groups at the district level to assist county and district cadres in assisting the masses in planting. They convened village cadres and veteran farmers for discussions to discuss planting methods, and instructed the village production committee to investigate and register, plan for livestock and seeds, organize manpower, and devote all efforts to replanting. Due to the leadership and problem-solving of the district and county cadres, the masses are now actively engaged in production. Geng Lao Ji, a production model from Nanzhi Qiu, took the lead in organizing with others to help each other in planting. Heng Qiu Village organized 22 mutual aid groups, including 162 households. On the 11th, they planted 400 mu in one day. On the 12th, all 193 households in the village participated in mutual aid to rush planting. Yangjia Zhuang Village, which lacked manpower and livestock, temporarily implemented a method of exchanging labor for labor and returning labor in the future to carry out planting. In order to regulate seeds, Yuhua and Hengxing stores and the Shukou Promotion Agency transported more than 7,400 jin of various seeds such as late corn, mobilized the masses to exchange them for wheat, or loaned them to the masses. After such a crash effort, more than 20,000 mu of replanting had been completed in the three days from the 11th to the 13th. By the 15th, the earliest planted seedlings had already emerged from the ground.

    "content": "Small Stories of Eliminating the \"Pro-Training Teachers\"\n\n(I) The artillery fire had already disrupted the marching order of the pro-training teachers. Combat team leader Qiao Lianke led Qin Yulin and Wang Changfa in charging towards the enemy at the forefront. Three enemies rushed towards Lianke with bayonets. Lianke first stabbed and killed the first enemy in front. At this moment, the second enemy's bayonet had already injured Comrade Qiao Lianke's head, but he immediately turned his gun and shot down the second enemy. Seeing the situation was bad, the third enemy was about to turn tail and run when he was shot down by another shot. At this time, Comrades Wang Changxu and Qin Yulin caught up and annihilated all the enemies who rushed over. At the end of the battle, they seized two pistols and six rifles. Although Qiao Lianke was injured, he carried two guns and a telephone set back victoriously.\n\n(II) In the battle to eliminate the pro-training teachers, the sixth squad of the seventh company was tasked with attacking the enemy. The warriors of the sixth squad rushed towards the enemy with swift and courageous combat actions. Second Platoon Leader and Wang Shengde, a disabled soldier of the sixth squad with only one arm, threw two hand grenades at the enemy crowd, scaring more than a hundred enemies into not daring to move. The deputy leader of the second platoon rushed forward fearlessly and took a machine gun from the enemy. Holding an unlit hand grenade in his left hand, he shouted: Brothers, those who surrender will not be killed, come over and we are one family. Comrade Wang Shengde also went up and seized five rifles from the enemy. At this time, the enemies, terrified out of their wits, quickly kowtowed and said: We surrender, we surrender. The deputy leader of the second platoon wanted to continue the pursuit mission, so he had Wang Shengde guard these prisoners with a machine gun. More than ten minutes later, the follow-up troops arrived, and Wang Shengde carried five rifles and two walkie-talkies to follow the troops.\n\n(III) The bandits of Yan's pro-training teachers were scattered by our brave and ferocious People's Liberation Army. A group of bandits of about a hundred people drilled around everywhere, running west when attacked from the east, and running east when attacked from the west. It happened to run to the aid station of the second company of our sixth detachment. Comrade Yao Taibao, the deputy political instructor of the sixth company, was unarmed at the time, but this was meat delivered to his mouth, so he couldn't miss the opportunity. He picked up a colored signal gun and shouted that those who surrender would not be killed. The enemy saw that he was alone and refused to surrender. Comrade Taibao became angry and shot one enemy dead. At this time, Huang Xingcai and three other comrades also arrived. The enemy became frightened and respectfully surrendered their weapons, capturing a total of fifty-six enemies, seizing two small cannons, one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, six rifles, and one eight-tone box.\n\n(Taiyue Telegram)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 消灭“亲训师”的小故事\n\n1948-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　消灭“亲训师”的小故事\n    （一）炮火已经把亲训师的行军序列打乱了，战斗小组长乔连科带着秦玉林、王昌发在最前边向敌展开冲锋，迎面三个敌人端着刺刀向连科扑来，连科便先将前边第一个敌人刺死，这时，第二个敌人的刺刀已刺伤乔连科同志的脑部，但他一下扭转枪口，就把第二个敌人打倒了。第三个敌人见势不妙，正想调转屁股逃命时，被他又一枪也干倒了。这时王昌许、秦玉林两同志赶上来又把冲过来的一股敌人全部歼灭，战斗结束时，他们组织获了手枪两支，步枪六支。乔连科虽然负伤，还扛着两支枪一架电话机子胜利而归。\n    （二）消灭亲训师战斗中，七连六班担任了突击敌人的任务，六班勇士们以神速勇猛的战斗动作向敌扑去，二排长和六班一只胳膊的残废战士王生德，向着敌人群中扔了两颗手榴弹，吓得一百多个敌人再也不敢动了。二排副奋不顾身的上前从敌人手中拿过一挺机枪，左手举着一颗未拉火的手榴弹，喊着：弟兄们，缴枪不杀，过来是一家人。王生德同志也上去夺过敌人五支步枪来，这时被吓掉了魂的敌人，连忙磕头捣蒜说：我们缴枪缴枪。二排副要继续完成追击任务，就让王生德拿着一挺机枪看管这些俘虏。十几分钟后续部队来了，王生德才背着五支步枪两个报话机追随部队去了。\n    （三）阎匪亲训师的匪徒们，被我勇猛如虎的解放军冲得七零八散了，一股匪徒约百余人到处乱钻，东面打来住西面跑，西面打来又往东面窜，恰巧窜到我六分队二中队的救护所，六连副政指姚太保同志，当时手无寸铁，但是这是送到嘴边的肉，可不能错过机会，就随手拿起彩号的一支枪，喊着缴枪不杀，敌人见他是一个人，就不缴枪，太保同志愤怒了，“叭”的一枪一个敌人送了命，这时黄兴才等三个同志也赶来了，敌人害了怕，就恭恭敬敬地缴了枪，共俘敌五十六名，缴小炮两门，重机枪一挺，轻机枪一挺，步枪六支，八音一支。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（太岳电）"

    "content": "Towering Crimes, Heroic Resistance\n  　Eyewitness Account from the Southern Bank of the Yellow River in the Ji-Lu-Yu Region\n    In the Henan region of Ji-Lu-Yu, the Chiang bandits are carrying out inhuman acts of rape, murder, arson, and looting against the people. To defend their lives, property, and the happiness of future generations, the broad masses of people have launched a tenacious and unyielding struggle.\n    \"Anything that belongs to the common people, they will rob it.\" This is the conclusion of the people of Henan regarding the Chiang bandits' looting atrocities. This spring, the 87th Regiment of the 68th Division of the Chiang bandits looted forty cartloads of timber from the Xiniu Lou Village in Linze. On the sixteenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar, the Chiang-sponsored Security Brigade, in collaboration with the puppet Second District of Cao County, robbed 160 bags of grain, 200 catties of cotton thread, more than 300 sacks, 30 sheep, 7 cattle, and 1 cart from Xiaoma Village in the Fifth District of Kaocheng. Five cattle and 7,000 catties of grain were robbed from Qianlu Temple in the Shijun District of Qibin County. The door panels in the southern half of Yuncheng County have been almost completely looted, with 120 pairs taken from Dawang Village alone. A total of fifteen households in Tawanji, Fifth District of Kaocheng County, were robbed, and according to the statistics of eleven households, the enemy robbed them of 30,065 catties of grain, 21 head of cattle and donkeys, 9 large and small carts, and 632 feet of white cloth. Jinan County lost as many as 700 head of draught cattle.\n    The Chiang Kai-shek gang desperately arrests young people to use them as cannon fodder. More than 500 young men were arrested by the enemy in the First District of Linze, with villages losing as many as 30 to 40 people each, and as few as two or three. One day, the enemy in Heze suddenly rushed into the villages of Dongmagai and Ximagai in Linze, forcibly assembled the masses for a meeting, and forced 146 young and middle-aged men to Heze at gunpoint. The whole village was filled with crying and cursing of the Chiang bandits' heinous crimes. Later, the Chiang bandits extorted 100 million yuan in Chiang currency from Dongmagai before releasing some of the captured men. A total of 400 young men were arrested by the enemy in Jinan County. Fifty people were arrested in Chengwu County. From the first to the fourth month of the lunar calendar, 16,500 young men were arrested by the Chiang bandits' Fifth and Eighty-fourth Divisions in Qibin County.\n    On April 11th, the puppet Second District of Cao County, in collaboration with the puppet Security Brigade, ransacked 73 households in Hou Dai Village, Fifth District of Kaocheng County, burning down 58 houses and smashing 70 pots. The village had 56 households who made a living by carpentry. All of their carpentry furniture was burned. On the sixteenth day of the second month of the lunar calendar, the puppet Second District of Cao County, in collaboration with a part of the Chiang bandits' Eighty-fourth Division Security Brigade, bloodbathed Xiaoma Village in Kaocheng County (a small village of 50 households), burning down 25 houses. A 79-year-old woman was burned to death, and all eight rooms of the village chief, Ma Xingfeng, were burned down. Village chief Ma Xingfeng, self-defense captain Ma Jingao, village office secretary Ma Huixuan, and nine other cadres and people were brutally murdered. In Changliu Village, Shan-Yu County (a new county), all the houses of 200 households were burned down. Most of the iron pots in Xiaoma Village were destroyed, and the people were forced to take turns cooking meals.\n    When the Chiang bandits' Fifth and Sixty-eighth Divisions and the 143rd Brigade passed through Qibin County, they gathered all the women in Guofenglou Village and raped them in turn. A fourteen-year-old girl in Dacao Village, Dingtao County, was gang-raped by a platoon of the Chiang bandits' Fifth Division. When her elderly grandfather stepped forward to try to stop them, he was beaten away with belts by the beasts. A young woman in Luji Village, Chengwu County, committed suicide out of shame and indignation after being raped by the Chiang bandits' Fifth Division. There are too many such incidents, and I, the reporter, cannot bear to write them down.\n    The people of Henan have not succumbed. They understand that the only way to deal with man-eating beasts is with swords and knives. A heroic and magnificent struggle is unfolding vigorously.\n    Ma Sicun, the village chief of Xima Village, Linze County, was captured by the Heze Chiang bandits on March 30th. The bandits beat him in every way possible, asking where the village's public grain was hidden. He remained unyielding until his death, without uttering a single word. After his heroic sacrifice, the villagers raised money to bury him and held a public memorial service. On the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, the Chiang bandits' Sixty-eighth Division and 143rd Brigade, in collaboration with local bandits, sneaked into Qianlu Temple Village, Qibin County, and forced all the villagers to gather in a field, demanding to know where the public grain was buried. All 160 people in the village were as strong as steel, and no one revealed any clues. The enemy used bayonets, rifle butts, belts, and wooden sticks, beating more than 100 people, regardless of gender or age. Four elderly people over the age of sixty, Lu Yuming, Lu Liuqing, Lu Xinzai, and Lu Fubin, were beaten half to death and covered in blood. The elderly Lu Yuming still keeps a bloody sock. When the reporter went to interview him, the old woman Lu pointed to the bloody sock and said, \"I will never forget the hatred of this bloody sock!\" The son of the village chief of Sun Village, Qibin County, was killed by the enemy. The father immediately went to the democratic district office to request arms and organized a revenge team of seven or eight people, who fought bravely against the enemy. One evening, Mr. Yan, an old gentleman from a village in Yuncheng County, invited two officers from the Chiang bandits' Fifth Division for a drink. After the enemy got drunk, the whole family took out the pre-prepared iron shovels and grappling hooks and secretly buried the enemy alive in the ground. A certain village militia relied on the tunnels in their village to persist in the struggle in the enemy's rear. On the twenty-second day of the third month of the lunar calendar, 300 men of the local bandit Zhang Shengtai's force attacked the village, determined to burn down the houses and destroy the tunnels. The bandit Zhang personally directed the charge toward the central street five or six times, but was bravely repelled by the militia. The enemy suffered more than 70 casualties and fled in disarray. During the wheat harvest, the villagers, under the protection of the militia, safely brought the wheat home without suffering any losses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 滔天的罪行英勇的反抗　冀鲁豫黄河南岸见闻记\n\n1948-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　滔天的罪行英勇的反抗\n  　冀鲁豫黄河南岸见闻记\n    在冀鲁豫河南地区，蒋匪正对人民实行灭绝人性的奸淫、烧杀和抢掠。广大人民为了保卫自己的生命、财产和后代子孙的幸福，展开顽强的英勇不屈的斗争。\n    “只要是老百姓的东西，他没有不抢的”。这是河南人民对蒋匪抢掠暴行的结论。今春蒋匪六十八师八七团在临泽西牛楼村抢去木材四十大车。旧历二月十六日，蒋记保安旅配合曹县伪二区所，到考城五区小马庄抢去一百六十布袋粮食、二百斤棉线、三百多条布袋、三十只羊、七头牛、一辆车。齐滨县石钧区前逯庙被抢去五头牛、七千斤粮食。郓城南半部的门板快被抢光了，仅大王庄一村就被抢去一百二十合。考城五区塔湾集共十五户，据十一户的统计，被敌抢去粮食三万零六十五斤，牛驴二十一头，大小车九辆，白布六百三十二尺。钜南损失耕牛达七百头。\n    蒋家匪帮拼命的抓捕青年替他当炮灰。临泽一区被敌抓去壮丁五百多人，每村多者三四十人，少者两三人。有一天菏泽敌人突然窜进临泽东西马垓村，强迫群众集合开会，将一百四十六个青壮年用枪逼住押往菏泽。全村哭声震天，咒骂蒋匪滔天罪行。后来蒋匪在东马垓敲榨了一万万元蒋币，才把抓去的壮丁放回一部。钜南全县被敌抓去青壮年四百人。城武则被抓去五十人。齐滨县从正月到四月，被蒋匪整五师八十四师抓去壮丁一万六千五百人。\n    四月十一日，曹县伪二区部配合伪保安旅，洗劫考城五区七十三户的后戴庄，烧毁五十八间房，打碎七十口锅。该村有户五十六，靠做木匠活为生，所有木匠家具都被烧毁了。旧历二月十六日，曹县伪二区部配合蒋匪八十四师保安旅一部，血洗考城小马庄（这是个五十户的小村），烧毁房屋二十五间，一个七十九岁的老太太被烧死了，村长马兴逢的八间屋子全烧光了。村长马兴逢、自卫队长马近诰、村公所书记马会轩等十二个干部群众，被残杀了。单虞县（新县）常刘村二百户人家，房屋全被烧光。小马庄的铁锅大部被毁，群众被迫轮流煮饭吃。\n    蒋匪整五师和六八师一四三旅从齐滨过境时，到国冯楼把全村妇女集中起来，施行轮奸。定陶大曹庄一个十四岁的女孩子，遭蒋匪整五师一个班轮奸，年老的祖父上前企图劝阻，竟被野兽们用皮带打出去。城武陆集一个青年妇女遭蒋匪整五师强奸后，羞愤自杀。这种事情太多，记者不忍写下去了。\n    河南人民并没有屈服。他们懂得对于吃人的野兽，只能用刀剑来对待它。英勇壮烈的战斗如火如荼的展开了。\n    临泽西马海村长马思存，在三月三十日被菏泽蒋匪捉住，匪徒们百般毒打，追问该村公粮放在哪里？他至死不屈，没有吐露一个字。壮烈牺牲之后，全村群众集资安葬，并实行公祭。旧历四月初八，蒋匪六八师一四三旅结合土顽窜入齐滨前逯庙村，强迫全村群众集合在一个场里追问公粮埋在什么地方，全村一百六十口人，都象钢铁一样的坚强，没有一个人说出任何的线索，敌人用刺刀、枪托、皮带、木棍，不分男女老少打了一百多个人，年过花甲逯玉明、逯留卿、逯新在、逯福彬等四人被打得死去活来，满身是血。逯玉明老人至今还保存着一只血袜，当记者去访问他时，逯老太太指着血袜说：“我啥时候也忘不了这血袜的仇！”齐滨孙庄村长的儿子被敌人打死了，父亲立即到民主区公所要求武装，组织了七、八个人的复仇队，和敌人英勇的战斗起来。郓城某村颜老先生，在一天晚上请蒋匪整五师两个军官喝酒，等敌人喝醉后，全家把预先准备好的铁铣抓钩拿出来，偷偷的把敌人活埋在地里。某村民兵依靠本村地道，坚持腹地斗争，旧历三月二十二日，土顽张盛泰部三百人进攻该村，决心烧掉房子，破坏地道。张匪亲自指挥向中心街冲锋五六次，都被民兵英勇击退，敌伤七十多人狼狈逃窜。麦收中该村群众在民兵保护下，安全把麦收到家里，没受一点损失。"

It is combined with the labor union organization. The director of the cooperative is also the director of the labor union, and the leader of the cooperative member group is also the leader of the labor union group. In the beginning, there was no capital. It was only organized by a group of wood and tile workers to contract projects. After more than five months, the number of members has grown to more than 150, gathering capital of 3.84 million yuan (border currency). The organization has enabled them to overcome the difficulties of small and scattered groups, insufficient funds, and incomplete manpower. They can contract for larger construction projects, ensure that all members have regular work, and drive more than 50 outside workers to produce. When there is a construction project, the cooperative will contract for it uniformly. First, the director technician will conduct an on-site survey, and then a meeting of group leaders will be held to decide whether to contract. If it is decided, the members will submit their own small subcontracting plans, which will be discussed at the meeting, and the most cost-effective one will be contracted. The contractor is responsible for freely organizing a group of members and recruiting a group of outside workers for construction (if there are not enough workers in the cooperative, outside workers can also be contacted). After the project is completed, a meeting is held to review the reasons for profit and loss. The cooperative stipulates that in addition to earning wages, the cooperative will distribute 35 percent of the profits as dividends for shares, 35 percent as labor dividends (based on the labor days of the members), and 30 percent as dividends for staff. The savings in labor and materials in the small subcontract are equally divided by the contracting members, and the saved working hours can be used to work elsewhere, and the wages earned are owned by the individual. All members fully exerted their enthusiasm. In April, the first phase of settlement yielded a net profit of 17 million yuan. In addition to contracting for larger projects, they are now beginning to operate in other areas. There are several points in the current system and methods of the cooperative that are worth studying and improving: (1) Wages and bonuses are all evenly distributed, which will certainly not be completely reasonable. If a certain reward system can be established, it will certainly be able to give better play to the enthusiasm of technicians and workers; (2) We should advocate bringing apprentices, especially leading some small workers to learn skills; (3) We should advocate small workers joining the cooperative and implement labor dividends for small workers, which can also improve the labor efficiency of small workers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石市土木合作社业务日益发展\n\n1948-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石市土木合作社业务日益发展\n    【石家庄讯】石家庄四区三街木瓦工人组织的土木建筑合作社，系木瓦工人集体互助的生产合作社，它与工会组织结合，合作社主任即工会主任，社员小组长亦即工会小组长。开始时并无资金，仅由一伙木瓦工人组织起来包工；经过五个多月到现在，社员已发展至一百五十多人，集结资金三百八十四万元（边币，下同）。组织起来使他们克服了小伙分散、资金不足、人手不齐的困难，能够包揽较大的建筑工程，保证全体社员经常有工做，并带动社外五十多名小工生产。遇有建筑工程，由合作社统一承包，先由主任技工实地勘察，再召开小组长会议决定是否承包；如果决定了，即由社员提出自己的小包工计划，经会议讨论，由最省钱的承包，负责自由组织一伙社员，招一伙社外小工进行建筑（社内工人不够时，亦可联络社外工人。）工程结束后，举行会议检讨赔赚原因。该社规定社员职员除赚工资外，合作社以百分之三十五作为股金分红，百分之三十五作为劳动分红（按社员劳动日分），以百分之三十为职员分红。小包工中节省的工料由承包社员均分，节省的工时可到别处做工，所挣工资归个人。全体社员充分发挥了积极性，四月份第一期结帐得纯利一千七百万元。他们现在除了承包较大工程，并开始至外埠活动。该社目前的制度与办法中，有几点值得研究改进：（一）工资与分红全是一律匀分，一定不会完全合理，如能建立一定的奖励制度，必可更加发挥技工与工人的积极性；（二）应提倡带学徒，特别是带领一些小工学手艺；（三）提倡小工入合作社，实行小工的劳动分红，亦可提高小工劳动效率。"

    "content": "Shijiazhuang News: A certain weaving factory is tentatively implementing a three-calculation wage system, resulting in a doubling of output compared to when production started, with a significant improvement in quality. Based on surveys and experimental calculations, and according to specific circumstances, the factory stipulated a three-calculation wage system (i.e., calculation by yardage, quality, and work attitude). After discussion by workers in each group of the trade union and approval by the factory leadership, it was implemented on May 1st. The specific measures are as follows: (1) Machine weavers have a fixed basic monthly wage. Each person oversees one loom, receiving the equivalent of 60 to 80 jin of millet; overseeing two looms earns 70 to 100 jin of millet. At the end of the month, the specific amount of the basic wage is determined based on the individual's production quantity, quality, and work attitude (such as protecting public property), after evaluation by the group and approval by the factory. (2) In addition to the basic wage, weavers overseeing one loom receive 1.7 liang of rice per yard of cloth woven, and those overseeing two looms receive 1.4 liang of rice per yard of cloth woven. (3) At the beginning of each month, looms are reassigned once according to the individual's production performance in the previous month. Workers overseeing two looms with the worst performance are reassigned to oversee one loom, while workers overseeing one loom with the best performance are reassigned to oversee two or even three looms. (4) Machine weavers, finishing workers, and general workers inside and outside the workshop are evaluated and rated within a certain period, based on their production performance and work attitude, within the established maximum wage limit. Since the implementation of this method, the previous problem of weavers only focusing on quantity and neglecting quality under the piece-rate wage system has been overcome. Not only has the quality improved, but the output has also increased. At the end of May, statistics showed that the highest daily output per loom had reached 48 yards (each bolt of cotton cloth being 40 yards). By the end of June, the output per loom had doubled compared to when production started.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石市某织厂实行三计工资　产量质量同时提高\n\n1948-07-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　石市某织厂实行三计工资\n  　产量质量同时提高\n    【石家庄讯】某织布厂，暂行三计工资，产量较开工时增加一倍，质量也有显著提高，该厂根据调查和实验计算，按照具体情况，规定三计工资（即计码、计质量、计劳动态度），经职工分会各小组工人讨论及厂部批准，于五月一日开始实行，具体办法为：（一）机织工每月有固定的基本工资，每人看一台布机，六十斤至八十斤小米，看二台布机七十斤至一百斤小米。以上基本工资数于月终时，根据本人本月生产数量、质量及劳动态度（如爱护公物等），经小组评议，厂部审核批准发给。（二）除基本工资外，看一台布机的每织一码布得米一两七钱，看二台布机的每织一码布，得米一两四钱。（三）每月初按照上月个人生产成绩好坏调机一次。看二台布机的工人成绩最差的调看一台布机，看一台布机成绩最好的调看二台或至三台布机。（四）机织工、整理工以及车间内外的杂工，在既定的最高额工资内，根据本人生产成绩及劳动态度，在一定期内评定。这一办法实行以来，克服了过去按件工资制时织布工人只顾数量不顾质量的毛病，不但提高了质量，也同时提高了产量。五月终统计每日每台布机产量最高的已达到四十八码（每匹棉布为四十码），六月终每台布机产量已比开工时增加一倍。"

    "content": "[Taiyue Dispatch] Jide Village, Yangcheng, held a joint meeting on the 9th of this month, including 78 village cadres and mutual aid team leaders, to review the two reasons for the loose organization of mutual aid teams: First, after the cadres corrected deviations, they thought that \"serving the masses\" and \"promoting democracy and freedom\" meant \"the masses can do whatever they want\" and \"do whatever the masses tell them to do,\" making them feel constrained and afraid to lead boldly. Liu Wang originally didn't participate in mutual aid with anyone. This year, when planting corn, he asked the team leader to send people to help. When everyone didn't go, the team leader and squad leader, in order to \"serve the masses,\" took the lead in helping, which caused dissatisfaction among the whole team. Second, a few people thought they had \"democracy and freedom\" and could \"do whatever they want\" in the team and didn't obey leadership. Cadre Li Huaiquan said: \"When we went to inspect mutual aid, we saw everyone doing their own thing, and when we asked a question, someone immediately retorted: This is 'freedom,' can you force me? We dare not say anything afterward, dare not lead.\" Based on these situations, everyone discussed in groups and decided on the following methods to overcome this laissez-faire tendency in the future. First, everyone has the freedom to participate in the mutual aid team. Joining or leaving the team is at each person's discretion, but once participating, they should abide by the team's rules, equal exchange, reasonable exchange of labor, democratic discussion, and joint implementation. Second, the difficulties of team members should be solved together, but they must be solved reasonably, exchanging labor for labor, and not harming the interests of others, to \"serve\" a few people. That night, each team held a meeting and re-established voluntary combinations. A total of 59 small mutual aid teams were reorganized in the village. Everyone freely joined or left the teams, and some opportunistic people were \"isolated\" by everyone. After the rectification, it happened to rain. The next morning, when they went to the fields, all 546 mu of stubble soybeans in the village were planted before lunch. The masses said: If we hadn't rectified the mutual aid, the replanting would have been delayed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 纠正无政府和反对领导的偏向　阳城吉德村整顿互助\n\n1948-07-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　纠正无政府和反对领导的偏向\n  　阳城吉德村整顿互助\n    【太岳电】阳城吉德村在本月九日召开包括七十八个村干部和互助组小组长的联席会上，检讨互助组散漫的两个原因：第一是干部纠偏以后，思想上认为“为群众服务”“发扬民主自由”就是“群众想干啥就干啥”“群众叫干啥就干啥”，弄的束手束脚，不敢大胆领导。刘旺本来就不和人互助，今年种玉茭时，要求组长派人帮助，大家不去，组长和分队长为了“为群众服务”，就带头去帮助，引起了全组不满。第二、有少数人以为“民主自由”，在组内“想怎样就怎样”，不服从领导。干部李怀全说：“咱去检查互助，看见大家各干各的，就问了一句，立刻有人顶嘴说：这是‘自由’，你还能强迫？咱以后就不敢吭气，不敢领导。”根据这些情况，大家分组讨论决定了今后克服这种散漫自流的办法。一、参加互助组，人人有自由，入组退组由各人自便，但参加了就应遵守组里的制度，等价交换，合理变工，民主讨论，共同执行。二、组员的困难共同设法解决，但须合理解决，变工还工，不能损害别人的利益，为少数人“服务”。当天夜里，各组都开了会，重新自愿结合。全村计重新结合了五十九个小型互助组。大家自由出组进组，有些讨巧的人被大家“孤立”出去了。整顿后刚巧下了雨，第二天一早上地，赶午饭时全村五百四十六亩回茬豆子就全部种完了。群众说：要不整顿互助，回茬还要误事哩。"

    "content": "Hengshui and Dezhou\n    [Shijiazhuang News] This reporter recently visited Hengshui City and Dezhou City. I arrived in Hengshui on the 9th, just in time for market day. The West Gate was very lively.\n\n    Hengshui's industry and commerce had a \"leftist\" deviation during the land reform last year. Seventy-four businesses were struggled against because they were related to the exploitation of landlords, rich peasants, and feudal elements in the countryside (some only had individual shareholders who were struggled against). In order to implement the policy of resolutely protecting industry and commerce, the county government re-investigated from the end of May. Among them, those that should not have been confiscated were returned after persuading the masses. Forty-one households have now been returned, with very detailed procedures. The items to be returned were discussed in advance, and then a meeting of the business owners, shareholders, and managers was convened. Representatives elected by the masses explained in detail, government cadres participated, and documents after the struggle were burned on the spot, hoping that the original owners would work hard to run the business. Jia Fusen, a representative of the poor people's association in Hexi Street, said when returning the Jujihao grocery store: \"We respond to Chairman Mao's call to resolutely protect industry and commerce. Take it back and work hard!\" The manager of the store was also very happy and said: \"The army is fighting old Chiang at the front, and we will run industry and commerce well in the rear.\" The returned businesses resumed operation as usual, and Hengshui City's industry and commerce completely returned to normal and became increasingly prosperous. By the end of May, there were 639 industrial and commercial households, with 1,858 employees.\n\n    When I arrived in Dezhou City, it was another scene. Boats were parked on the canal in the west of the city. Some boats were more than ten yards long and could carry 200,000 catties. The bedrooms and kitchens in the boats were very exquisite. Three rows of small boats continuously crossed the pedestrians and vehicles. On the streets of Dezhou City, newly hung plaques and bright doors and windows of shops were everywhere. There are two situations for newly opened shops: industrial and commercial households who were struggled against in last year's land reform are now being returned (83 out of 113 households have been returned to their original owners). Inside and outside the South Gate, there are more than 20 connected shops that were all built and opened since the beginning of this spring. Various red and green congratulatory plaques for \"New Opening Celebration\" are still hung with colored silk. The Huabei Shoe and Hat Shop, right outside the city gate, only opened on the 21st of the fourth lunar month. At the beginning, it could sell 40,000 to 50,000 North Sea currency per day, but now it sells 120,000 to 130,000 per day (the exchange rate between North currency and Border currency is one to ten). Shopkeeper Li said that he is planning to expand his current bedroom into a storefront and build another bedroom in the back. When asked about the construction of this row of new houses, he said: \"When the city was liberated two years ago, the enemy in the city—the Kuomintang vanguard army reorganized from Wang Jixiang's unit of puppet troops—burned the houses of civilians and merchants at the base of the city wall for fear that the People's Liberation Army would enter the city. These are only being built now.\"\n\n    Dezhou City was originally a commercial center for water and land transportation. Now, there are more than 1,600 businesses in 69 industries. Among them, there are 53 industrial enterprises such as textiles and iron, and four private silver firms. The freight business is particularly developed, and recently some merchants from the Chiang area have invested in operations.

On the evening of the 7th, they completely surrounded both locations. On the 9th, the People's Liberation Army captured Fancheng and, braving the intense heat and poison gas bombs released by the Chiang bandits, successively removed commanding heights such as Pipa Mountain, Fenghuang Mountain, Zhenwu Mountain, and Hei Hu Yan south of Xiangyang city. The Chiang bandits' 15th Pacification Zone Command, 104th Brigade, and local Chiang forces, totaling 16,000 men, retreated and gathered inside the city to resist stubbornly. At 20:30 on the 15th, our army began to attack the city, first destroying all the city wall fortifications. Within five minutes, the assault team crossed three small moats and layers of barbed wire obstacles, and climbed onto the city wall. At this time, the enemy counterattacked several times, but were repelled by us. Our army then advanced deeper. After fierce street-by-street and house-by-house fighting, most of the defending enemies were annihilated, leaving only the Chiang bandit Pacification Zone Command and more than one regiment holding the Zhonggulou (Bell and Drum Tower) two strongholds, struggling desperately.

    "content": "Taihang Telegram: After rectification, the Communist Party branch of Dongchan Village in the Fifth District of Ping Shun has undergone significant changes in its style, fully promoting the leading role of the Party, taking the lead in promoting the production movement, and making great achievements. Many party members have been selected as model party members within the branch, and model cadres among the masses. The relationship between the Party and the masses has been improved unprecedentedly. The prestige of the branch among the masses has been greatly enhanced. Since sowing, the village branch first led the masses to reorganize mutual aid teams under the principle of democratic, voluntary, and equivalent exchange, combining 42 groups (373 households, 573 full and semi-laborers of both sexes). The village’s 1,799 mu of grain land, 916 mu of corn, and 740+ mu of miscellaneous fields were all sown according to plan. After sowing, comrades Lu Laixing, a party member, and Huang Huazhang, the deputy village head, organized 15 male full laborers to engage in transportation during the slack farming season, earning 115,000 yuan (Jichao, same below), and personally led 20 laborers to work short-term jobs outside, earning 270,000 yuan. Semi-laborers and women were responsible for weeding (corn, cotton), ensuring that both agricultural and sideline production were not neglected. In late June, weeding and summer harvesting came at the same time. The branch promptly proposed to arrange life well and organized a large number of auxiliary laborers and semi-laborers to participate in weeding and summer harvesting, mobilizing 219 women to work in the fields. Party members took the lead, and summer harvesting and weeding were completed in about 20 days. The masses said: \"This year is better and faster than in previous years.\" One of the reasons for the improvement in speed and quality is that mutual aid is truly based on voluntary association and equivalent exchange, and particularly because after the Party rectification, the whole village is harmonious and united, and everyone is motivated and willing to produce. In the past, the village did not have the habit of going to the fields before dawn, but this year they went to the fields before dawn. Party member cadres and labor heroes led the way more vigorously than in previous years, and women who had never worked in the fields before began to participate in labor. On the 10th of this month, the branch held a summary meeting to summarize this stage of production work and elected model party members. On the 11th, the whole village was divided into five regions to conduct mass summary of experiences, checking of shortcomings, and election of models. Many party members were elected as various models and heroes. Branch Secretary Cheng Baoyu and two other party members were elected as model cadres, Cheng Jiangze and six other party members were elected as labor heroes, Cheng Zhaocai (party member) and 12 others were elected as propaganda models, Niu Huaichun and 80 others were elected as production activists, and Niu Jushui and two other teams were elected as model teams, Guo Fujing and four other groups were elected as model groups. Party members and cadres truly played an exemplary and leading role in this production movement. The mutual aid team of Ma Buren (party member), the director of the production committee, had a total of 17 households, eight of which were poor people and bachelors, and three of which were wrongly criticized households. These people were either poor laborers or lacked agricultural implements and food. No one wanted to join their group when they combined for mutual aid. Comrade Buren organized them, helped them borrow food, and solved the difficulties with agricultural implements. During mutual aid, he gradually educated and transformed the poor people. Not only did they complete the summer harvest and weeding work, but they also took the time to work short-term jobs, earning 75,000 yuan. They are now elected as a model mutual aid team in the whole village. In addition to being responsible for leading the overall work, Branch Secretary Cheng Baoyu constantly and patiently educated in the group, transforming Cheng Shuanghai, Chen Jinshui, and four others who had not worked for many years and loved to eat and be lazy. Chen Jinshui was also elected as a production activist. Cheng Xiurong, a wrongly criticized household, actively led production and enthusiastically did propaganda work after correcting his status. In June, he submitted 10 articles to the newspaper and was elected as a propaganda model. Niu Fquan's team, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, had a Niu Huaifu, who felt that mutual aid was not free and voluntarily withdrew from the team. All those who participated in the mutual aid team weeded their seedlings well, but his seedlings were one foot high and could not be weeded. At this time, Fuquan went to talk to him about his thoughts, using the facts before him as an example, and persuaded him to join the mutual aid team again. At the summary election, labor hero Guo Xinnian (prosperous middle peasant) happily said: \"In the past, I was uneasy and afraid of equal division, but now I am not afraid. I must boldly lead everyone to become rich under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and live a good life.\" Subsequently, the production committee rewarded the heroes and models respectively and reported the good news and merits to their families. The masses loved and supported the cadres and party members even more, and in the actual movement, they believed more in the Party's production and wealth-creation policies, breaking various concerns.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东禅支部党员带动全村　各阶层和谐团结生产\n\n1948-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东禅支部党员带动全村\n  　各阶层和谐团结生产\n    【太行电】平顺五区东禅村中共支部经过整党后，作风已有显著转变，充分发扬了党的领导作用，带头推进生产运动，做出很大成绩。许多党员在支部内被选为模范党员，在群众中被选为模范干部，党与群众关系空前改善。支部在群众中的威信大大提高。下种以来，该村支部首先领导群众在民主自愿等价交换的原则下重新整顿了互助组，结合起四十二个小组，（三百七十三户，男女全半劳力五百七十三个）全村一千七百九十九亩谷地、九百一十六亩玉茭、七百四十余亩杂田，按计划全部完成下种。下种后，党员卢来兴和副村长黄花掌二同志，在农忙空隙中又有计划的组织了十五个男全劳力搞运输，赚洋十一万五千元（冀钞，下同），又亲自带领二十个劳力出外打短工，赚洋廿七万元。半劳力和妇女则负责锄杂苗（玉茭、棉花），做到农副生产两不误。六月下旬锄苗夏收一齐挤来，支部及时提出要很好安排生活，并组织大量辅助劳力与半劳力参加锄苗夏收，发动起二百一十九个妇女上地劳作，党员带头领导，二十天左右将夏收拔苗全部完成。群众说：“今年比往年都完成的好，完成的快。”好和快的原因之一，是因为互助真正作到自愿结合，等价交换，特别是由于整党以后，全村空气和谐团结，都有劲有心意生产了。过去该村没有起五更上地的习惯，今年天不明就上地了；党员干部和劳动英雄，比往年领导的都起劲，从来不登地边的妇女也开始参加了劳动。本月十日，支部召开总结会，总结这一段生产工作，选举了模范党员。十一日，全村分五个地区进行群众性的总结经验检查缺点和选举模范，许多党员被选为各种模范和英雄。支书程保玉等三个党员被选为模范干部，程江则等六个党员被选为劳动英雄，程招才（党员）等十二人被选为宣教模范，牛怀春等八十人被选为生产积极分子，牛聚水等两队被选为模范队，郭福景等四组被选为模范组。党员和干部在这段生产运动中，真正起了模范带头与骨干作用。生产委员会主任马布仁同志（党员）的互助组共十七户，其中八户是尖薄人和光棍，还有三户是错斗户。这些人不是劳动差，就是缺少农具吃喝。结合互助时谁也不愿和他们碰组。布仁同志把他们组织起来，帮助借粮食、解决农具困难。在互助中逐渐教育改造了尖薄人，不但完成了夏收锄苗工作，并抽空打短工，赚洋七万五千元，现在被选为全村模范互助组。支书程保玉除负责领导全盘工作外，在组内不断耐心教育，将长年不劳动爱吃懒做的程双孩、陈金水等四人改造过来，陈金水并被选为生产积极分子。错斗户程秀荣订正成份后，积极领导生产，热心作宣传工作，六月份给报上投稿十次，被选为宣教模范。武委会主任牛富全的组里有个牛怀富，觉得互助不自由，自动退了组，参加互助组的都把苗锄好了，他的苗子有一尺高，还锄不出来。富全这时去和他谈心思，以眼前的事实作例子，说服他又参加了互助组。总结选举时，劳动英雄郭辛年（富裕中农）高兴的说：“过去情绪不安，怕平分，现在可不怕了，一定要大胆领导大家发家致富，在共产党毛主席领导下过好时光。”随后，生产委员会即分别奖励各位英雄模范，并向他们的家庭报喜报功。群众对干部党员更加爱戴与拥护，且在实际运动中更加相信党的生产发家政策，打破了各种顾虑。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st – According to various sources, Yu Hongjun, president of Chiang Kai-shek's Central Bank, announced on the 18th that four new denominations of large-value Gold Standard Notes would be issued from the 19th: namely 10,000 yuan, 25,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 250,000 yuan. The exchange rate between the Gold Standard Notes and the \"Legal Tender\" is 20 to 1, so Chiang Kai-shek's \"Legal Tender\" is equivalent to 200,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, 1 million yuan, and 5 million yuan. The highest denomination of the new banknote (5 million yuan) is 50 times higher than the previous highest denomination of Chiang Kai-shek's currency (100,000 yuan). Previously, the Chiang government issued Gold Standard Notes in denominations of 1,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan on December 9th last year, equivalent to 20,000 yuan, 40,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's \"Legal Tender.\" It is widely believed that the issuance of such huge banknotes will inevitably lead to a surge in prices. On the eve of the issuance of the large banknotes, Shanghai's financial and commodity prices had already begun to rise sharply. On the 17th alone, milk prices soared 4.8 times, gasoline rose by 40 percent, and hotel room rents increased by 60 percent. On the same day, the U.S. dollar exchange rate broke through the 7 million yuan mark, reaching 7.2 million yuan per U.S. dollar, an increase of 1.2 million yuan compared to the 10th; gold had risen to 350 million yuan per tael, an increase of 50 million yuan compared to the 9th; and rice, after a brief decline, has now rebounded to 35 million yuan per dan.

On July 7th, the \"East China Front\" newspaper of the Shandong Corps Political Department published an editorial calling on all units attacking Yanzhou to \"be brave and resourceful, integrate military and political affairs, resolutely annihilate the enemy, and capture Yanzhou.\" The leaders of a certain unit issued a letter to all commanders and fighters, calling on everyone to strive for the glorious titles of \"Yanzhou Battle Merit Company\" and \"Yanzhou Hero.\" On the 8th, a certain division held a determination meeting of cadres at the battalion level and above, pointing out that all conditions for the liberation of Yanzhou had been met. The division commander also expressed his determination at the meeting. The regimental and battalion commanders of the division personally went to the main attack troops to mobilize, discuss, and guide the siege operations. Many companies asked their superiors to give them the main attack or commando mission, and launched mutual challenges. The Second Company of a certain regiment proposed competition conditions to the Seventh Company, including \"Mass discipline should achieve four nos: no wandering thoughts, no wandering eyes, no itchy hands, no greedy mouths,\" etc. The Seventh Company's letter of challenge added the \"four fasts\" conditions for military actions, namely: \"Fast continuous blasting. Fast bridge and ladder erection. Fast ladder climbing to the city, and fast development upon city entry.\" In addition, various units and arms scheduled to perform different tasks held joint meetings, or wrote letters and visited each other to ensure coordinated actions. Director Jiang of a certain artillery unit led more than ten cadres to visit the infantry units undertaking the main attack, held a step-artillery coordination meeting, introduced the experience of step-artillery coordination during the liberation of Weixian, the performance and power of various cannons, and how to cooperate with infantry actions, greatly enhancing the infantry's confidence in attacking strongholds. Many commanders and fighters have made personal plans, and cooks and health workers are no exception. Subsequently, various units launched a wave of military learning. The Second Battalion headquarters of a certain unit made a large sand table operation on a 100-square-meter site, and convened various shooters and combat squad leaders and above of the entire battalion to conduct research. Then, each platoon also conducted sand table operations to study tactics. Xie Yucheng, a liberated fighter who had worked on fortifications in Yanzhou, specially introduced to everyone everything he was familiar with. When discussing, the Third Platoon of the Sixth Company first mobilized everyone to raise concerns and difficulties, and then studied ways to overcome them. The entire Eighth Company learned to climb soft ladders and build bridges, and the speed was three times faster than before.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 军政结合深入动员　攻兖战斗前准备充分\n\n1948-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　军政结合深入动员\n  　攻兖战斗前准备充分\n    【新华社津浦前线二十一日电】进攻兖州的解放军在战前曾作充分准备。七月七日，山东兵团政治部“华东前线”报即发表社论，号召攻兖各部“勇敢机智，军政结合，坚决歼灭敌人，打下兖州”。某部首长发布了告全体指战员书，号召大家争取“兖州战功连”，“兖州英雄”等光荣称号。某师于八日召开营以上干部的决心大会，指出解放兖州已具备一切条件。师长并在会上表达了自己的决心。该师各团营长则亲自到主攻部队去动员、讨论、指导攻城作业。许多连队都要求上级给予主攻或突击任务，并展开互相挑战。某团二连向七连提出竞赛条件有“群众纪律做到四不：心不想、眼不花、手不痒、嘴不馋”等条。七连的应战书又加上军事动作的“四快”条件，即：“连续爆破快。架桥架梯快。爬梯登城快，登城发展快”。此外，预定担任不同任务的各单位，各兵种又举行联合会议，或互相写信、访问，保证协同动作。某炮兵部队姜主任率领十余干部访问担任主攻的各步兵部队，举行步炮协同会议，介绍了解放潍县时步炮协同的经验，各种炮的性能威力及如何配合步兵动作，大大增强了步兵攻坚的信心。许多指战员都纷纷订出个人计划，炊事员、保健员也无例外。各部接着展开了军事学习热潮。某部二营营部在一百平方公尺的场地上做了一个大沙盘作业，召集全营各种射击手和战斗小组长以上干部进行研究。然后各排也进行了沙盘作业，研究战术。过去曾在兖州做过工事的解放战士谢玉成并专门向大家介绍了他所熟悉的一切情况。六连三排在讨论时，首先发动大家提顾虑、提困难，再研究克服办法。八连全连都学会爬软梯、架桥、速度比过去快三倍。"

A total of thirty representatives attended: fifteen representatives from various districts, ten representatives from county-level party, government, and people's organizations, one doctor representative, one student representative, one teacher representative, and two shop employee and merchant representatives. Zhao Lorang, a respected local figure hired by the government, also attended. The election was conducted using a secret, multiple-name ballot. Zhao Lorang and two others were publicly selected as ballot supervisors. The election results: Comrade Chen Ze San, a representative of the Communist Party in Tang County, was elected as a regional representative with twenty-seven votes; Song Shaowen, the former Director of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, was elected as a representative of senior revolutionary cadres with twenty-nine votes; Yan Yiqing, a respected local figure from Tang County (currently working in the Border Region Government's Agriculture and Forestry Department), was also elected as a representative with twenty-seven votes. Attendees presented many proposals to the elected representatives, hoping they would bring them to the North China People's Representative Conference. Summarized, these include the following: 1. The government should vigorously support production. Now that many poor and hired peasants have been allocated land, they cannot produce well because they lack floating capital to buy tools. Technical improvements are also needed, such as eliminating pests and diseases. In particular, organizing labor is even more important, and the government should provide strong leadership. 2. Support-the-frontline services should be vigorously reorganized, organizational leadership strengthened, and civilian labor conserved. Formal regulations should be established for the care of families of militiamen on long expeditions. Grain tax burdens should be promptly promulgated, made fair and reasonable, to encourage production and stabilize production morale. 3. The Communist Party has achieved brilliant results in leading the masses in the People's Revolutionary War and land reform. After party rectification, the relationship between the Party and the people has become even closer, and the Party's popularization has been further enhanced. It is hoped that the Communist Party will continue to implement the spirit of party rectification and transform certain branch members to make the Party more pure and strong. 4. A unified village government organization should be established quickly, a democratic style cultivated, democratic education strengthened, and extreme democratic phenomena overcome. 5. Orphans, widows, and households without labor cannot engage in production and face the greatest difficulties in life, and a solution should be found.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 唐县召开人民代表会　宋劭文等当选代表\n\n1948-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　唐县召开人民代表会\n  　宋劭文等当选代表\n    【察哈尔电】唐县于本月十七日召开全县人民代表大会，选举华北临时人民代表大会的代表。共到会代表三十人：计各区代表十五人，县级党政民各机关职员代表十人，医生代表一人，学生代表一人，教师代表一人，商店职员和商人代表二人，政府聘请的社会贤达赵洛让也出席参加。选举采取无记名连记法进行。公推赵洛让等三人监票。选举结果：唐县共产党代表陈泽三同志以二十七票当选为区域代表；原晋察冀边区行政委员会主任宋劭文以二十九票当选为高级革命职员代表；唐县社会贤达阎翼清（现在边府农林处工作）亦以二十七票当选为代表。到会者向当选代表提出许多提案，希望他们带到华北人民代表大会上去。归纳起来，有以下数项：一、政府应用大力扶植生产。现在不少贫雇农分地后，因浮财少，买不上工具，不能很好的生产；在技术上也需要提高，如消除病虫害等；特别是组织劳力更为重要，政府应以大力领导。二、支前勤务应用大力整顿，加强组织领导，节省民力。对远征民兵家属的照顾，应有正式规定。公粮负担应迅速颁布办法，作到公平合理，以奖励生产，稳定生产情绪。三、共产党领导群众进行人民革命战争和土地改革，获得光辉成绩。整党后党和人民的关系，更密切了，党的群众化更提高了一步，希望共产党继续贯彻整党精神，改造某些支部党员，使党内更加纯洁坚强。四、应迅速建立统一的村政权组织，树立民主作风，加强民主教育，克服极端民主现象。五、孤寡无劳力户不能进行生产，生活最困难，应设法解决。"

Six weeks have passed, but the Athens government, which has sold itself to the Americans, has interpreted our statement as a sign of weakness of the Democratic Army and, following the orders of its American masters, has rejected our proposal. The Royalist Fascist army thought that, together with their American masters, a resolute offensive would defeat the Democratic Army. Since June 14th, we have launched fierce offensives many times in the northern Pindus Mountains; the developments of the past month have demonstrated the invincible strength of the Democratic Army and the weakness of the Royalist Fascist army.

After the village was liberated last year, 22 households voluntarily started leaching salt. Later, due to repeated intrusions by Chiang Kai-shek bandits into Zhengding City, people became anxious, and the industry fell into a state of self-flow. This spring, after research at the production meeting, a total of 31 groups were organized, including the 22 households from last year. Nine new leaching ponds were opened, and there are now 62 drying ponds. Each group is under the unified leadership of the production director; special personnel are responsible for soil preparation, water leaching, and salt drying. Some people wanted to participate, but could not expand due to a lack of tools and food. Later, the government provided a loan of 4,000 jin of millet, and 13 more groups were organized. Currently, the entire village has 45 groups, 44 leaching ponds, and 88 drying ponds. On average, they can produce 2,200 jin of salt per day, earning 3.66 million Border Region currency. The living problems of many people have been solved as a result. The elderly Cheng Qun couple and their two daughters happily said, \"Last year we produced 3,000 jin of salt. If we work harder this year, we can exceed half of last year's output, and life will be better.\" Many others said, \"In the old society, officials wouldn't allow us to leach salt. If we secretly leached a little, we would be punished if caught. Now the government lends us grain to help us leach salt, so we should work hard.\" Now each leaching pond can support fifteen people. Small salt production has solved the problem of food shortages for poor farmers in the village before the wheat harvest.

The labor unions in northern Kyushu, Japan, decided on the 20th to hold a one-hour general protest strike, declaring that the Ashida government should be held responsible for this crime. Major factories in the Tokyo and Osaka areas have organized protest rallies. Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party on the 20th, stating: \"The Central Committee of the CPSU is deeply indignant at the despicable accomplices of the enemies of the Japanese people for attempting to assassinate our comrade Tokuda—an outstanding leader of the Japanese working class. The Central Committee of the CPSU hereby expresses its deep sympathy to the Central Committee of the JCP, and hopes that Comrade Tokuda will quickly resume his fruitful activities for building a democratic and peace-loving new Japan.\" The Italian Communist Party's newspaper \"L'Unità\" pointed out that this new crime was also instigated by American imperialism and stated: In Japan, just as in Italy, the instigators of war are trying to eliminate democratic forces in order to drag these countries into war. However, the counterattack they have encountered in Italy and will encounter in Japan will certainly be a serious warning to them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日本九州北部工人决定总罢工　抗议反动派谋刺德田\n\n1948-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日本九州北部工人决定总罢工\n  　抗议反动派谋刺德田\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方报导：日本反动派谋刺日共领袖德田球一的卑鄙罪行，已激起日本国内外的义愤的风暴。日本九州北部各职工会，已于二十日决定举行一小时的抗议总罢工，并宣称芦田政府应对这一罪行负责。东京与大坂地区的各大工厂，均已组织了抗议集会。苏联共产党中央委员会书记马林科夫二十日致电日本共产党中央委员会称：”联共中央对日本人民的敌人可鄙的走卒谋刺我们的德田同志——日本工人阶级杰出的领袖——甚为愤慨。联共中央兹向日共中央表示深切的同情，并望德田同志将迅速恢复他的为建设民主的爱好和平的新日本而进行的有成果的活动。”意共机关报“团结报”于是重指出这一新罪行同样是由美帝国主义策动后称：在日本，正象在意大利一样，战争的煽动者正在试图纹杀民主力量，以便将这些国家卷入战争。然而，他们在意大利所已遭遇的和将在日本遭遇的反击，对他们一定会是一个严重的警告。"

    "content": "Reviewing Past \"Bureaucratic\" and \"Militarized\" Work Styles\n　　Northeast Unifies Military Supplies Production\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: In order to adapt to the development of the war situation, the Northeast People's Liberation Army Military Region Headquarters established a Military Supplies Production Department in May to uniformly lead the military supplies production of the entire army and be responsible for supplying all military needs of the Northeast troops. The military supplies production units established by various troops and organizations in the past have been abolished. The department held a joint meeting of bureau chiefs and factory directors in the middle of last month to discuss issues such as improving production organization, factory management, and wages. The meeting reviewed the \"bureaucratic\" and \"militarized\" management styles of the military supplies factories in the past. In the past, too many personnel in most factories received supply system treatment; in some factories, non-production personnel accounted for more than 35%. As a result, costs were higher than those of private factories. The management of some factories was completely militarized, with workers going to work, and attending meetings after work, and the management of workers was too restrictive. In terms of production, due to decentralized operations, the styles and quality of products were not uniform, and operations were unplanned, resulting in staggering waste. After careful research by the bureau chiefs, factory directors, and technicians, various production standards were determined. For example, clothing, shoes, hats, etc., were all subject to unified style standards and quality standards based on the principles of durability, practicality, and economy. According to the new clothing standards, 2.3 square feet of cloth can be saved for each set of cotton clothes. After the quality of the shoes is improved, one pair of shoes per person can also be saved each year. Comrade Li Fuchun of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC called on logistics staff at the meeting to always pay attention to saving people's resources, and at the same time, to have a high degree of spirit to complete tasks and obey discipline. He particularly pointed out that in the past, not only was there great waste due to decentralized production, poor planning, and poor management, but also great waste due to poor warehouse management and transportation organization. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen business and improve business, and strive to eliminate waste in production, storage and transportation.\nAccording to the department: Military supplies production in various places has begun to show a new atmosphere after the meeting. Factories have generally begun to move towards enterprise. Personnel who originally received supply system treatment have been changed to a salary system after evaluation, and non-production personnel have been greatly streamlined. For example, the non-production personnel of the Third Clothing Factory have been reduced to 6%. In terms of management methods, the undemocratic phenomena of military management, command-style management, and simple punishment in the past have been corrected. In the past, units without trade unions have generally established trade unions, and outstanding workers have been selected to study in trade union cadre training classes.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 检讨过去“机关化”“军事化”作风　东北统一军需生产\n\n1948-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　检讨过去“机关化”“军事化”作风\n  　东北统一军需生产\n    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北解放军军区司令部为适应战争形势的发展，特于五月间成立军需生产部，统一领导全军军需生产，负责供应东北所有部队军需。过去各部队、机关所设之军需生产单位则一律取消。该部于上月中旬曾召开局长、厂长联席会议，讨论改进生产组织、工厂管理及工资等问题。会议检讨了过去各军需工厂“机关化”、“军事化”的管理作风。过去大部工厂按供给制待遇的人员过多；有的工厂非生产人员竟占百分之三十五以上。因此成本比私营工厂高。某些工厂管理完全军事化，上班做工，下班开会，对工人的管理上限制过严。在生产上，由于分散经营，出品式样和质量不统一，经营无计划，造成惊人的浪费。经各局长、厂长与技工的精密研究，确定了各种生产标准。如衣服、鞋、帽等都按结实、适用、节约的原则划定统一的式样标准与质量标准。按着新的服装标准，每套棉衣即可节省布二点三方尺。鞋的质量提高后，每人每年亦可节省一双鞋。中共东北局李富春同志在会上号召后勤工作人员要时刻注意节省人民资材，同时要有高度完成任务，服从纪律的精神。他特别指出过去不仅因生产分散及计划不精、管理不良有很大浪费，而且由于仓库管理、运输组织不好也有很大浪费。今后必须加强业务提高业务，为消灭生产中、保管中及运输中的浪费现象而斗争。\n    据该部称：各地军需生产在会议后已开始呈现新的气象。工厂普遍开始走向企业化。原按供给制待遇的人员一律经过评定改为工薪制，非生产人员大量精简，如第三被服厂非生产人员已减到百分之六。在管理方法上，纠正了过去军事管理，命令包办，单纯惩罚的不民主现象。过去没有工会的单位，普遍成立工会，并选派优秀职工到工会干部训练班学习。"

Social order stabilized, various classes tended towards harmony and unity, the party's policies were clarified, and ideological concerns were dispelled, leading to a shift towards active production. The entire village has 45.5 hectares of land. Except for wheat fields, 35 hectares of seedlings have been hoed twice for 90% of the area, and 27 hectares have been universally topdressed. Middle peasant Li Shuanhong said, \"When the land law came down in the spring, everyone said it would be equally divided, so I didn't dare use manure, fearing that I wouldn't be able to harvest what I planted. If I had known it wouldn't be equally divided, I would have used more.\" Now, in addition to applying his family's manure, he has also bought 650 jin of sesame cakes and topdressed all 8.2 acres of his seedlings. Zhao Quanshui said, \"In the spring, others said I was a rich peasant. I didn't understand the policies well, and I thought I should take a break early, not knowing when I would be struggled against. This time, after reclassifying, I was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant, and I felt relieved. My family's 31 acres of seedlings have been universally topdressed, with a total of 280 dan of farm manure, 950 dan of sheep manure, and 67 dan of farm manure, an average of 45 dan per acre.\" Bao Zhongfu is a new middle peasant, and his family didn't have enough manure. He searched and bought everywhere, using three dou of rice to buy the farm manure from three toilets in the district office to fully supplement his needs. Middle peasant Qin Haifu was wrongly struggled against last year and was gloomy all day long. This time, he was compensated during the correction. He happily said, \"As long as you take off my landlord hat, I don't need compensation.

According to an article \"Speaking of the Tears of Silkworm Farmers\" published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao in early last month: In the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area of Zhejiang, a famous silkworm production area, silkworm farmers are suffering from the exploitation of the Kuomintang authorities and local despots. Half of the income of farmers in this area depends on silkworm raising every year. This year, as the cocoon harvest just came on the market, the Chiang government's \"National Economic Commission\" has already lowered the price of cocoon collection to 20 million yuan per dan (note: this figure is based on Central News Agency reports), and stipulated that \"the purchase price of green cocoons will not be changed during the purchase period.\" However, the cost of silkworm farmers, just for mulberry leaves, requires 45 million yuan for each dan of silkworm cocoons produced (calculated as 15 dan of mulberry leaves required per dan of silkworm cocoons, with each dan priced at 3 million yuan), not including labor costs. The officially set price is already less than half of the cost. Bureaucratic capital colludes with local despots to form cocoon firms, forcibly purchasing cocoons at a low price of 15 million to 18 million yuan by relying on their power. They also specially made large scales, with each 100 jin weighing 2 jin more than ordinary scales. When silkworm farmers are unwilling to sell, they are threatened with armed violence. The provincial Department of Field Grain is also stepping up the collection of field taxes while the people are facing a shortage of food, ordering them to pay with silkworm cocoons. Under layers of plunder, the silkworm cocoons of many farmers are all looted, and they immediately fall into poverty and hunger.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 浙江蚕农的血泪\n\n1948-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　浙江蚕农的血泪\n    【新华社华中二十一日电】据上月上旬沪大公报刊载“挥泪话蚕农”一文报导：著名蚕丝出产地的浙江杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）地区，蚕农正惨受国民党当局及地方土劣的剥夺。该地农民每年收入的一半系依靠养蚕，今年茧花刚刚上市，蒋政府“全国经济委员会”即已将收茧价格低压至每担二千万元（按：此数字系根据中央社报导），并规定“青茧收购期内不再更动”，而蚕农血本，仅桑叶一项每生产一担蚕茧即需付出四千五百万元（计每担蚕茧需桑叶十五担，每担价格为三百万元），人工劳力尚未计算在内。官定价格本已不及成本之半，官僚资本又与地方土劣勾结，合组茧行，以一千五百万至一千八百万的低价，仗势强行收购，并特制大秤，每百斤又较普通秤大出二斤，当蚕农不愿出售时，即以武装暴力相威胁。该省田粮处亦趁民间粮食青黄不接，加紧催收田赋，勒令以蚕茧抵偿，不少农民在层层掠夺下，蚕茧全被搜刮，而立即陷于贫困与饥饿中。"

    "title": "Chiang Kai-shek's Ruling Crisis Intensifies: People in Chiang-Controlled Areas Refuse to Use Chiang Currency; Hyperinflation Reaches Collapse Stage, Silver Dollars, Foreign Currency, or Bartering Used Everywhere",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-27",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st – Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that due to the intensifying ruling crisis of Chiang Kai-shek and hyperinflation, the Chiang-issued “legal tender” is increasingly losing credibility among the people. The phenomenon of people in Chiang-controlled areas refusing to use Chiang currency has spread from the vast rural areas to major cities since this spring. Chiang currency is increasingly being replaced by silver dollars, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, which have relatively fixed value or credibility. The phenomenon of rejecting Chiang currency and engaging in barter trade in rural areas is also becoming increasingly common. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishibao on June 27th, the buying and selling of silver dollars has been prevalent in Nanjing, the capital of Chiang Kai-shek's government, for three months, especially recently. The Central News Agency also admitted: \"Nanjing merchants have openly set up stalls to buy silver dollars at high prices\" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, June 21st). In Peiping (now Beijing), according to the aforementioned newspaper on June 1st, since Chiang Kai-shek announced the adoption of \"legal tender\" in 1935, silver dollars, which had been \"retired\" for more than ten years, have now \"resumed their official duties, performing the work of exchange media.\" Everywhere you can see \"people carrying silver dollars\" and hear \"the sound of silver dollars.\" \"Silver dollars buried in the ground and hidden in the walls are pouring out.\" Xiaoshi in Deshengmen, Mashi Bridge in Fuchengmen, Xiaoshi in Xuanwumen, Xiaoshi in Andingmen, Xiaoshi in Dongdan Market, and Wupailou outside Qianmen have now become famous silver dollar markets in Peiping. In addition, peddlers who buy cameras, antique shops, and jewelry stores also engage in silver dollar transactions. As soon as people get Chiang currency, they quickly exchange it for silver dollars to avoid being deprived in the face of soaring prices. Besides Peiping, the buying and selling of silver dollars is becoming increasingly common in cities such as Qingdao, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, and Taiyuan. As for inland cities, silver dollars are already directly in circulation. According to a report by the Tianjin Yishibao's traveling reporter on June 27th: From Anqing via Wuhan, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, to Liuzhou, \"silver dollars have replaced legal tender and circulate without hindrance\" all the way. Whether it is a restaurant, a gold store, or a hotel, everywhere you hear \"the crisp sound of silver dollars.\" In addition to buying and selling \"ordinary silver coins,\" deposits, gifts, and gatherings are generally made in \"silver dollar units,\" and interest is also \"calculated in silver dollars.\" In some areas, such as Changsha, Hengyang, and Xiangtan, \"legal tender\" has \"almost completely retreated to the status of 'subsidiary currency.'\"\n\nIn major cities, the price of silver dollars rises along with the prices of goods and foreign exchange rates. On the 25th and 26th of last month, each silver dollar could be exchanged for 2.25 million Chiang currency in Qingdao, 2.6 million in Nanjing, and 2.7 million in Taiyuan. The exchange rate between silver dollars and US dollars is approximately one dollar for seven or eight jiao. In Hunan cities, the exchange rate between silver dollars and Hong Kong dollars is approximately one to three.\n\nIn the rural areas of Chiang-controlled areas, the phenomenon of people refusing to use Chiang currency has long been widespread. Yu Hongjun, the president of Chiang's Central Bank, also had to admit that as a result of the widespread spontaneous use of silver coins by the people, a serious phenomenon of \"paper money (referring to Chiang currency) concentrating in cities\" has been created (according to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on June 19th). According to a report in the Shanghai Economic Weekly on April 29th, citing Xinmin Bao news: The Chiang authorities planned to build a 500-kilometer-long Milening (from Mile to Ninglang) highway in Yunnan. Because the local area uses \"silver dollars as the unit and legal tender does not work,\" Chiang's Yunnan Provincial Government has been forced to allocate 200,000 silver dollars for construction costs. According to a report in the Shanghai Economic Weekly on September 25th of last year: As early as the autumn of last year, rural areas in Jiangnan had generally used specific objects as price calculation units instead of Chiang currency. The most common was rice, and in yarn-producing areas, it was yarn. All loans, operations, and payments were calculated in yarn or rice, and Chiang currency was only used for sporadic payments or when both parties agreed.\n\nIn Shanghai and Guangzhou, the international trade centers of China, the market has gradually excluded Chiang currency and switched to using the more stable US dollars and Hong Kong dollars as the standard for calculating commodity prices. In Shanghai, initially only renting houses and leasing shops were directly calculated in gold bars and US dollars, but since this spring, \"some retailers have also started asking for US dollars\" (according to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on May 27th). By the end of last month, when the economic storm in June reached its peak, Shanghai stores sold goods \"demanding US dollars whenever possible\" (according to an Associated Press report on June 25th). In Guangzhou, according to a report in the Shanghai Economic Weekly on April 29th, citing the Dagong Bao: Since the price increase in April, most of the units of account for all transactions have been Hong Kong dollars. Guangzhou newspapers also report commercial conditions in Hong Kong dollars. All imported and non-imported goods are priced in Hong Kong dollars, and then the selling price in Chiang currency is calculated based on the current price of Hong Kong dollars. The report also stated: \"Not only in Guangzhou, but even in county towns and villages, Western paper (i.e., Hong Kong dollars) is universally accepted. Corrupt officials naturally use Western paper as the unit for discussing cases, and robbers and bandits also use Western paper as the unit for kidnapping and extortion.\"\n\nThe increasingly significant loss of credibility of Chiang currency marks a new stage in Chiang Kai-shek's inflation crisis—the beginning of the complete collapse stage of currency. It also marks the further monopolization of the economic lifeline of Chiang-controlled areas by American and British imperialism through the deep circulation of US dollars and Hong Kong dollars in China. Because the rural areas of Chiang-controlled areas have universally established \"bastions to prevent the intrusion of legal tender\" (Shanghai Economic Weekly), returning to barter trade or automatically switching to silver dollars; in cities, not only is the role of Chiang currency as a price standard and means of payment disappearing, but its last function, that is, its role as a means of circulation, is also increasingly being replaced by silver dollars and US dollars and Hong Kong dollars. As a result, \"the scope of legal tender circulation has been greatly reduced\" (ibid.); on the other hand, because of the prevalence of gold, US dollar, and Hong Kong dollar trading, people are unwilling to store Chiang currency and are competing to dump Chiang currency, which greatly increases the speed of Chiang currency circulation, and prices calculated in Chiang currency rise even faster. Both of these aspects are promoting the more rapid collapse of Chiang currency's credibility.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋贼统治危机加剧　蒋区人民不花蒋币　恶性通货膨胀已到崩溃阶段到处用银元外币或以实物交易\n\n1948-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋贼统治危机加剧\n  　蒋区人民不花蒋币\n  　恶性通货膨胀已到崩溃阶段到处用银元外币或以实物交易\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合各方消息：由于蒋介石统治危机与恶性通货膨胀的加剧，蒋记“法币”在人民中已日益失去信用。蒋区人民拒用蒋币的现象，自今春以来，已由广大农村扩展至各大城市。蒋币已日益被较有固定价值或信用的银元、美钞、港币所代替，而农村中排拒蒋币，进行物物交换的现象也日见普遍。据天津益世报六月二十七日披露：蒋介石政府首都南京，三个月以来，已盛行银元的买卖，尤以最近为烈。中央社亦承认：“南京商人已公开设摊高价收买银元”（该社南京六月二十一日电）。在北平，据前引报纸六月一日载：从民国二十四年蒋介石宣布改用“法币”起“退位”了十几年的银元，现又“官复旧职，执行它交换媒介的工作”，到处可以看到“带银元的人”和听到“银元的声音”。“埋在地里和藏在墙里的银元都涌出来”了。德胜门晓市、阜城门里的马市桥、宣武门小市、安定门小市、东单市场小市及前门外五牌楼等处，现在都成了北平著名的银元市场。此外，如收买照相机的小贩、古玩店、金珠店等也都经营银元交易。人们一拿到蒋币，就赶快把它换成银元，以避免在物价飞涨中被剥夺。除了北平以外，青岛、徐州、开封、太原等城市，银元的买卖均日见普遍。至于内地各城市，银元则已直接通行。据六月二十七日天津益世报所登载之该报旅行记者通讯报导：从安庆经武汉、长沙、衡阳、桂林，到柳州，一路上“银元已代替法币而通行无阻”。无论饭店、金店或旅社，在在都闻“银元的清脆响声”，除买卖“普通用银币”之外，普遍存放款、送礼和集会，也完全用“银元作单位”，而利息也随着“按银元计算”；在若干地区，如长沙、衡阳、湘潭一带，“法币”且“几乎已完全退至‘辅币’的地位”。\n    在各大城市中，银元均随着物价、外汇的上涨而上涨，上月二十五及二十六两日，每个银元在青岛可兑蒋币二百二十五万元，在南京是二百六十万元，在太原是二百七十万元。银元与美钞之间，大约维持着一元七、八角合一美元的比值。而在湖南各城市，银元与港币大约维持着一与三之比。\n    在蒋区农村中，人民拒用蒋币的现象早已遍见各地。蒋记中央银行总裁俞鸿钧亦不得不承认：由于各地人民普遍自动使用银币的结果，已造成“纸币（指蒋币）向都市集中”的严重现象（据中央社六月十九日南京电）。据四月二十九日上海经济周报缓引新民报消息：蒋当局拟在云南修一条五百公里长的弥宁（从弥勒至宁蒗）公路，因当地使用“银元作单位，法币行不通”，蒋记云南省府已被迫拨给银元二十万元作为兴建费用。另据去年九月二十五日上海经济周报披露：江南农村早在去年秋天，即已普遍以特定的实物作为价格的计算单位，代替蒋币，最普通的是稻米，产纱区则为纱，一切借贷、经营、支付都以纱或米来计算，只在零星支付或双方同意时，才用蒋币。\n    在中国的国际贸易中心的上海及广州，市场上亦已逐渐排除蒋币，而改用比较稳定的美钞及港币作为计算商品价格的标准。上海最初只是租房子、顶铺子系以金条美元直接计算，而自今春以来，“一些零售商也开始索取美元”了（据美联社上海五月二十七日电）。至上月底，当六月经济风暴达到顶点时，上海商店出售货物“只要可能就索取美元”（据该社六月二十五日电）。在广州，据今年四月二十九日上海经济周报援引大公报消息称：自四月涨风后，一切交易的计算单位，大部分都是用港币了，广州各报亦均以港币为单位报导商情，一切舶来品非舶来品，均以港币标价，再以港币时价伸算出蒋币售价来。该报又称：“不独广州，连县城、乡下，西纸（即港币）亦无所不通。贪官污吏之讲案件，固然以西纸为单位，强盗绑匪之掳人勒索，亦均以西纸为单位。”\n    蒋币日益显著地丧失信用，标志着蒋介石通货膨胀危机的新阶段——则通货完全崩溃阶段的开始。同时也标志着美英帝国主义利用美钞港币的深入中国流通而进一步垄断蒋区经济命脉。而由于蒋区农村普遍树立起“阻遏法币侵入的堡垒”（上海经济周报语），回复到物物交换或自动改用银元；在城市中蒋币不仅作为价格标准和支付手段的作用正在消失，而且它的最后的一个机能，即作为流通手段的作用亦日益为银元及美元、港币所代替。其结果，是使“法币流通范围大为缩小”（同前）；另一方面因为黄金、美钞、港币买卖的盛行，人们不愿收存蒋币，竞将蒋币抛出，又使蒋币流通的速度大为增加，以蒋币计算的物价更涨得快。这两方面都在推动蒋币信用更加迅速崩溃。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Reliable news from the Jinzhong front: Chiang Kai-shek is rushing to produce a tear gas hand grenade, which will soon be used on all front lines of the bandit army in an attempt to stop the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army. This grenade does not explode. Five seconds after ignition, it releases a gas that is lighter than air, which can last for about fifty seconds. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the front lines must pay close attention to this despicable trick of the Chiang bandits. Due to repeated military failures and the declining morale of the army, Chiang Kai-shek is trying to use this heinous method to save his dying fate. Chiang's bandits have used poison gas on various battlefields. According to incomplete statistics, there have been five incidents in the past six months: (1) On February 13th of this year, in the battle near Shifo Temple, north of Shenyang, the New 1st Army, New 3rd Army, and New 6th Army used asphyxiating poison gas shells once. (2) On March 31st, in the battle of Yilin, west of Funing, the 113th Brigade of the reorganized 51st Division continuously used poison gas shells three times. (3) During the Linfen battle in April and May, Liang Peihuang, the lieutenant general deputy commander-in-chief of the 7th Army Group of the Chiang-Yan bandit army and the highest commander in Linfen, repeatedly used tear gas, sneezing gas, and asphyxiating gas against our army. Chiang's planes also transported poison gas and poison gas shells to the city for Liang's use. During our army's siege of the city, Liang ordered Duan Liqing, a physics and chemistry teacher at Linfen Normal School, to manufacture 60 bottles of tear gas. Liang and Duan have now been captured, and the evidence is complete. They will be handed over to the military court and punished as war criminals according to the law. (4) On June 25th, the enemy defending Xiguan, Yanzhou, fired poison gas shells at our army. (5) In early July, in the battle in the Hei Hu Yan area on the outskirts of Xiangyang, Kang Ze, Chiang Kai-shek's head of intelligence, ordered the 104th Brigade to release a large amount of poison gas against our army. It is worth noting the propaganda coordination of the bandit's rumor-mongering agency, the Central News Agency, regarding this crime. Whenever the bandit army is in military crisis and preparing to use poison gas, it first fabricates the myth that the People's Liberation Army used \"poison gas\" as a public opinion preparation for its actual actions. On April 29th of this year, when we were besieging the defenders of Ying County most tightly, the Central News Agency did this, which was actually the Yan bandits using poison gas in Linfen. Now, as our Jinzhong army approaches Taiyuan, the Central News Agency's Taiyuan dispatch on the 13th is spreading the same rumors, and its conspiracy is worthy of vigilance. Military sources say: As early as June 1925, countries around the world jointly stipulated \"prohibiting the use of poison gas or other gas or germ warfare methods.\" We now once again warn those Chiang-Yan officers who command the release of poison gas and those who manufacture poison gas to repent as soon as possible and immediately stop this criminal behavior that violates international law. Otherwise, the People's Liberation Army will treat such culprits as war criminals and will not be lenient.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋阎匪军垂死挣扎准备大批使用毒气　放毒制毒人员如不悔悟决按战犯处理\n\n1948-07-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋阎匪军垂死挣扎准备大批使用毒气\n  　放毒制毒人员如不悔悟决按战犯处理\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】晋中前线确息：蒋介石正在赶制一种催泪性毒气手榴弹，即将在匪军各个前线使用，以图阻挡人民解放军的胜利进攻。该弹并不爆炸，拉火后五秒钟即放射一种较空气为轻的毒气，可以持续约五十秒钟。人民解放军前方将士必须严密注意蒋匪军此种卑鄙手段。由于军事节节失利，军队士气日益低落，蒋介石正企图用此种罪恶手段挽救其垂死命运。蒋匪在各个战场，施放毒气，据不完全统计，半年内已有五次。（一）今年二月十三日沈阳以北之石佛寺附近战斗，新一军、新三军、新六军等部使用窒息性毒气炮弹一次。（二）三月三十一日阜宁西之益林战斗，整五十一师一一三旅连续使用毒气弹三次。（三）四、五月临汾战斗，蒋阎匪军第七集团军中将副总司令兼临汾最高指挥官梁培璜曾一再向我军施放催泪、喷嚏、窒息等毒气，蒋机并向该城输送毒气与毒气弹，供梁使用。在我军攻城期间，梁下令临汾师范理化教员段利清制造催泪性毒气六十瓶。现梁段均已生俘，人物证件俱在，即将交付军事法庭，按战犯依法治罪。（四）六月二十五日兖州西关守敌向我军发射毒气炮弹。（五）七月上旬襄阳外围黑虎堰地区战斗，蒋介石的特务头子康泽下令一○四旅向我军施放大量毒气。值得注意的是匪方造谣机关中央社对此种罪行在宣传上的配合。凡属匪方军事危急准备施放毒气时，它就事先捏造所谓解放军使用“毒气”的神话，作其实际行动的舆论准备。今年四月二十九日我围攻应县守敌最紧之际，中央社即曾这样做过，实则是阎匪在临汾施放毒气。现在，我晋中大军逼近太原，中央社十三日太原电，又在散播同样的谣言，其阴谋值得警惕。军方人士称：早在一九二五年六月，世界各国就曾共同规定“禁止运用毒气，或其他瓦斯、微菌战争方法”我们现在再一次警告那些指挥施放毒气的蒋阎军官和制造毒气的人员，应及早悔悟，立即停止这种违犯国际公法的罪恶行为。否则人民解放军对此等祸首决按战犯处理，不稍宽容。"

    "content": "Taiyue Electric: The Taiyue Yujin Match Factory, after correcting the \"leftist\" deviation in worker relations during this year's May Day celebrations, put forward the slogan \"Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices.\" The relationship between masters and apprentices throughout the factory has improved, and both production quantity and quality have significantly increased. The old concept of \"keeping a secret when teaching apprentices\" has begun to change in the minds of most veteran workers. Zhang Guanwu, the chairman of the labor union, said: In the past, due to a lack of understanding of the correct policy of worker movements, many \"leftist\" deviations occurred in the relationship between masters and apprentices. Some apprentices demanded extreme democracy. If the master said a few words to the apprentice, the apprentice would not speak to the master for several days, and some would say negative things behind his back, deliberately lowering the master's prestige. Masters were therefore dissatisfied with apprentices and unwilling to teach them their skills, which affected the unity of veteran workers and apprentices and the improvement of production. The labor union and the factory once mistakenly selected apprentices as group leaders on the machines in each department, further causing unrest and dissatisfaction among the veteran workers. This was clearly agricultural socialism, which undermined productivity. After \"Respect Teachers and Love Apprentices\" was proposed this year on May Day, the relationship between masters and apprentices has improved. Apprentices have begun to respect the master's teachings, and the master has also paid attention to explaining techniques to apprentices and carefully guiding their work. Therefore, both skills and output have improved. In the past, the matchsticks produced by the peeling machines and cutting machines were of poor quality, resulting in a lot of waste. Now most of them can be used. The factory and the labor union have accepted this experience and further clarified that improving the relationship between masters and apprentices is the key to improving production.\n\nThe Yujin Match Factory is a relatively large match factory in the Taiyue Liberated Area, with 160 employees, a 15-horsepower gas engine, a 5-kilowatt generator, and small machines such as log peelers, splint peelers, and stick cutting machines. From December of last year to the present, production efficiency has increased from three boxes per day to ten boxes per day. This match factory, like other industrial constructions in the liberated areas, has gradually developed from small to large. Manager Hao said: \"The workers demonstrated extraordinary creativity and amazing efforts in building this factory. The factory's 15-horsepower gas engine was originally a gasoline engine, which required one barrel of gasoline (27 catties) per day, worth 200,000 yuan (Jicha, the currency of the time). Worker Hao Dehai painstakingly researched and transformed it into the current gas engine, which burns a maximum of 300 catties of coal per day, costing less than 2,000 yuan, more than 100 times cheaper than before. Worker Yuan Xueli created a small blade machine on the splint peeling machine, which can replace the function of a marking machine. Initially, there was no stick cutting machine, so Zhao Futang came up with a way to replace it with something else. After a lot of repairs and modifications, he finally built this match factory.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 裕晋火柴厂“尊师爱徒”　效率提高质量改进\n\n1948-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　裕晋火柴厂“尊师爱徒”\n  　效率提高质量改进\n    【太岳电】太岳裕晋火柴厂，在今年“五一”节纠正职工关系上的左倾偏向，提出“尊师爱徒”的口号后，全厂师徒关系已有改善，生产数量和质量也有显著提高；“教学徒要留一手”的旧观念，在一般老工人的思想上已经有了改变。工会主任张官武说：过去由于没有掌握正确的职工运动的方针，在师徒关系上曾发生过不少左倾偏向，有些学徒要求极端民主，师傅说学徒几句，学徒就几天不和师傅说话，有的背地说些二话，故意降低师傅威信。师傅因此不满学徒，不愿再教给学徒技术，影响到老工人与学徒的团结和生产的提高。工会和厂方曾经错误的把各部机器上的小组长都选给学徒当，更加引起老工人的不安和不满，这明明是农业社会主义，破坏生产力。今年“五一”节提出“尊师爱徒”以后，师徒关系已有改善，学徒开始尊重师傅的教导，师傅也注意给学徒讲解技术，并细心指导学徒工作，困此技术和产量都提高了。过去剥杆机、切杆机制造的火柴杆，因为质量不好，浪费很多，现在大部能够使用了。厂方和工会接受了这一段经验，更加明确了目前改善师徒关系是提高生产的关键。\n    裕晋火柴厂是太岳解放区较大的一个火柴厂，全厂有一百六十个职工，有一部十五马力的煤气机和一部五个启罗的发电机，及轴木剥机，盒片剥机，切杆机，盒片切机等小型机。从去年十二月到现在，生产效率已由日出三箱增加到日出十箱。这个火柴厂和解放区的其他工业建设一样，是从小到大，逐步发展起来的。郝经理说：“工友们创建这个工厂，曾经发挥了卓越的创造和惊人的努力。该厂十五马力的煤气机原是一部汽油机，每日需一筒汽油（二十七斤），价值二十万元（冀钞，下同）。工友郝德海苦心研究改造，改成了现在的煤气机，每日最多烧三百斤煤，所费不足两千元，与前相较，价低一百多倍。工友袁学礼在盒片剥机上创造一部小刀机，可以代替一部划印机的功用。起初没有切杆机，赵福堂就想出用别的东西来代替；经过很多的修理改造，终于建设成了这个火柴厂。"

Considering that the 12th Division was originally a Northeast Army unit, the People's Liberation Army was reluctant to see them sacrifice their lives for Chiang Kai-shek and repeatedly explained the righteousness to them, urging them to recognize the general trend and turn to the people's side. Unexpectedly, the enemy Huo Shouyi stubbornly refused to come to his senses. The People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the night of the 24th, first occupying Liulichang in the northeast of the city that night. On the 25th, they captured Xiguan. The defending enemy even fired poison gas shells at this time. Fortunately, we were well prepared and suffered no damage. On the 1st of this month, our army continued to capture Zhao Village outside Xiguan. On the 3rd, they captured Doufu (tofu) shop and the outposts of Qianyao and Houyao outside Nanguan.

Under the coercion of the \"督战队 (督战队: Dūzhàn duì, literally \"supervising battle team\", referring to units assigned to ensure troops followed orders during combat, often associated with strict discipline and potential punishment for retreat or failure)\" , the defending enemy launched desperate counterattacks against the outposts we occupied, but were all defeated by us. By the 8th, all the important outposts around Yanzhou had fallen into our hands. At 8 p.m. on the 12th, our army launched a fierce attack on the city. Under the cover of powerful and accurate artillery fire, the infantry first crossed several rows of chevaux-de-frise, barbed wire, and outer moats on the western wall, bravely climbed the city walls, and eliminated all enemy resistance. Immediately afterwards, they crossed the inner moat and entered fierce fighting. Other sections of the city walls were also successively breached by us at the same time. Our attacking troops quickly joined forces, smashing the enemy into pieces, and a large part of them were annihilated by us; a part that fled to the vicinity of the southeast of the city was also completely annihilated by us. The battle ended victoriously at dusk on the 13th, only a day and night after the start of the city attack.

The article continued by stating that the Italian reactionaries' murder of Togliatti's life and their current actions are proof of their weakness, not proof of their strength. The unparalleled and sweeping momentum of the Italian people's movement in recent days proves how absurd the ruling parties' excited cries of victory after the April elections were.

The Italian working people, who are rising to defend their democratic rights, will unite more closely under the banner of the Communist Party and the People's Democratic Front and fight for their freedom, independence, and against the dark forces of reaction.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 谋害托氏罪行激起世界公愤　亿万人的心充满着愤怒！　真理报评世界人民抗议谋害托氏罪行\n\n1948-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　谋害托氏罪行激起世界公愤\n  　亿万人的心充满着愤怒！\n  　真理报评世界人民抗议谋害托氏罪行\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联真理报于十八日发表题为“亿万人的愤怒”的论文。论文首称，整个民主世界都在抗议谋害托格里亚蒂的邪恶阴谋；亿万人的心里充满着愤怒；表示工人团结一致和热爱反法西斯主义战士的函电，从世界上的每一个角落送往罗马；抗议恶毒罪行的罢工和游行示威浪潮席卷了全意大利；下院和上院已经提出要对政府投不信任票和要求其辞职的议案。论文继称，意大利反动派对托格里亚蒂生命的谋害及目前的作为，是他们软弱的明证，不是他们强大的明证。近日来意大利人民运动的无与伦比的横扫一切的声势，证明了四月选举后统治政党们那样兴奋高呼的胜利是何等荒诞无稽。论文末称，对意大利劳动人民领袖生命的凶恶谋害，证明了国际反动派在其反民主运动中不惜采取最令人痛恨的手段。全世界民主势力必须进一步团结，对反动派作顽强的不可调和的斗争，以回答罗马的暗杀。全世界的民主人民不能允许这种恐怖行动再行发生。正在奋起保卫其民主权利的意大利劳动人民，将在共产党和人民民主阵线的旗帜下，更密切的联合起来，为他们的自由、独立和反对反动的黑暗势力而斗争。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS reports: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued an appeal to the Italian people on July 16th, stating that the heinous plot to assassinate Togliatti has aroused a wave of anger and protest throughout Italy and the world. This wave has forced the politicians responsible for the current political situation in Italy and the assassination plot to feign regret. However, the united work stoppage of all sectors and all working people across the country, as well as the angry protest demonstrations—which are anti-government in nature—reflect the general belief that the responsibility for this despicable act ultimately lies with the reactionary forces' policy of conflict and provocation. The Italian General Confederation of Labor, which received the immediate, full, and heartfelt support of the People's Democratic Front, organized and led a massive mass movement, comparable only to the victorious uprisings of our country's working class in past years. Although the government threatened to use force, millions of working people—workers, office workers, farmers, and shopkeepers—rose up to warn the war-mongers, to warn those who would stop at nothing and at any cost to prevent the realization of new principles of people's democracy. Now, these destructive and brutal forces have heard the strong voice of working Italy, a voice that has been clearly expressed since the liberation of Italy: how great is the power of working Italy. The statement continued that, at this critical moment, the position taken by the government of church reactionaries, and its blatant desire to act with retaliation and assassination—as a result of which the people's blood has flowed in the streets and squares—has proven to the world more clearly than ever the correctness of the Communist Party's position, and because of this position, the Communist Party intends to intensify preparations to defend democratic freedom, the laws of the republic, and the rights of working people. The statement emphasized that all sincere democrats are convinced of the need for greater unity in order to meet the demands of the people across the country for a new political direction in our country, in order to prevent and thwart any attempts by the government to further incite any provocative and retaliatory actions due to the instigation of its reactionary plans. The statement concluded by saying that the Communist Party leadership extends its fraternal condolences to Comrade Togliatti, the leader of the Italian Communist Party, and we sincerely hope for his speedy recovery.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 谋害托氏罪行激起世界公愤　意共领导机关号召人民　坚决保卫民主自由\n\n1948-07-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　谋害托氏罪行激起世界公愤\n  　意共领导机关号召人民\n  　坚决保卫民主自由\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社报导：意共领导机关于七月十六日发表告意大利人民书称：谋害托格里亚蒂的罪恶阴谋，在全意大利和全世界激起了愤怒与抗议的浪潮。这一浪潮，使得那些应对意大利目前政治形势及谋害阴谋负责的政治家们，不得不伪装遗憾。但是，全国一切部门所有劳动人民的一致停止工作以及愤怒的抗议示威游行——它具有反政府性质——，反映了总的信念，即这一卑鄙行为的责任，归根在于反动派冲突与挑衅的政策。受到人民民主阵线立即、全部和衷心支持的意大利总工会，组织并领导了巨大的群众运动，这种情形只有我国劳动阶级在过去年代中胜利的起义堪与伦比。虽然政府威胁着要采用武力，但是成百万的劳动人民——工人、职员、农民和店主——都起来警告战争挑拨者，警告那些不惜采用一切办法和不惜任何代价以阻止新的人民民主原则之实现的人们。现在，这些破坏性的凶残的势力，已经听到了劳动的意大利底强有力的声音，这一声音自意大利解放之日起就十分明晰地表现了：劳动的意大利的力量是多么伟大。该文告继称，在这一严重的时刻，教会反动派的政府所采取的立场以及它借报复和暗杀以行动的露骨欲望——其结果，人民的血液已流在街头和广场——已向全世界较任何时候更清晰地证明了共产党立场的正确，而由于这一立场，共产党打算加紧准备活动，以保卫民主自由、共和国法律和劳动人民的权利。该文告着重指出，一切真诚的民主分子确信有更大的团结的必要，以便适应全国人民对我国新的政治方向的要求，以便防止并阻遏政府因其反动计划的鼓动而可能进一步发动的任何挑拨与报复行动的企图。该文告结语称，共产党领导机关对意共领袖托格里亚蒂同志致以兄弟的慰问，我们衷心祈望他早日康复。"

Friends and enemies of Italy, both at home and abroad, heard Togliatti's voice. The enemies wanted to stifle this voice.

Four bullets opened the eyes of many people. Today, millions more Italians realize that their country's peace, freedom, and independence are in danger.

The general strike marked the beginning of a new great battle, and millions of Italians are filled with the determination to defend peace, freedom, and national independence.

The local leading bodies in the areas where the disease has occurred must, in the spirit of \"life first,\" quickly organize Chinese and Western doctors to carry out emergency treatment and implement joint diagnosis and treatment. In areas where the disease has not occurred, medical associations should be the center for absorbing experienced Chinese and Western medical personnel to hold seminars, strengthen research on diseases and medicine, improve technology, and pass on prescriptions for treating diseases.

    "content": "[Taihang News] In Dongaikou, the third district of Zuoquan, party members and cadres lead the masses to precisely arrange their lives, absorb semi-able-bodied laborers to participate in weeding seedlings, complete agricultural work ahead of schedule, and also seize the remaining labor force to develop sideline occupations. Before weeding, the production committee made a precise calculation: the whole village has a total of 661.7 mu of small seedlings, with 60 male full laborers. Calculated at an average of 0.8 mu of weeding and millet pulling per work day, it will take half a month to complete. In order to complete the weeding ahead of schedule and free up time for supporting the front, the production committee asked village cadres to go to various mutual aid groups to carry out propaganda and mobilization, and organized 35 women and 42 children to participate in temporary mutual aid to start weeding. Some group members had the idea of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture. When the group leader asked Liu Jinkui to weed, he said: \"Weeding is important, but you can't stop the livestock and tie them to the trough without earning a living.\" He only wanted to go out and transport coal. The group leader said to him: \"Our main way to get rich is through agriculture. If we don't weed the seedlings now and can't harvest grain, it won't work to just rely on sideline production to earn a few dollars. Farming has seasons, transportation doesn't. If you farm the land well, you can do sideline occupations at any time.\" Liu Jinkui thought it made sense, so he went to the field. This good point of his was praised, and his enthusiasm for production was increased. Other groups also had the idea of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture. Village chief Zhang Tong and branch secretary Huangfu Ji convened a meeting to explain the importance of weeding, \"Raising crops is the lifeblood. If you don't weed the seedlings, the land will be barren and you won't be able to harvest grain, which won't work no matter what.\" At the meeting, everyone discussed the method of combining weeding and sideline occupations, and decided to implement a collective coal carrying system of \"no barren land, no idle donkeys,\" with good livestock handlers concentrating on driving the livestock. Huangfu Zhen could drive four animals alone. Huangfu Shan was 63 years old, and could only earn 7 points working in the fields, but driving livestock was his specialty. The group let him drive two mules and he could earn 10 points a day. He happily said: \"Don't worry! I guarantee I will drive the livestock well and have fewer illnesses.\" Some livestock-raising households reflected that they didn't have fodder. Huangfu Zhen quickly bought back two dan of black beans, 500 jin of wheat bran, and more than 1,000 jin of dry grass for everyone, solving everyone's difficulties. Huangfu Mishan happily said: \"When everyone works together, you don't have to worry too much. Just do what you can!\" With the sideline occupation problem solved, everyone went to the fields with peace of mind, starting early and working late. The weeding, which was originally estimated to take half a month, was completed in seven days. During this period of production, many activists emerged. Cao Jinxiang, an old woman of 77, actively participated when she heard that the mutual aid group was mobilizing women to weed in the fields. Her group had a total of seven male and female members, and they pulled six mu of millet a day, earning her nine points. The old woman's actions influenced others, and Jia Yuying, who never went to the fields, also joined the weeding group. Zhao Guihua, a military family member, earned 93 points in the mutual aid group after weeding her own land. Branch Secretary Huangfu Ji, who was chronically ill, also led six children and pulled two mu of millet in one day.\n    After weeding the first time, they used three days to pull the wheat and planted autumn seedlings. Now, the groups are applying top dressing to increase production. Huangfu Lanzhu said: \"My seedlings are growing better this year than in previous years, but there is too little fertilizer. I only applied 15 loads per mu.\" He and his second child, Huangfu Qingheng, swept sheep manure with woolen bags on Wolingyan, sweeping eight bags a day, adding five dan of sheep manure per mu. Huo Yinchang led the whole group to grow milk pumpkins and corn, and has already grown more than 100 mu.

    "content": "[Chahar Telegram] Pingxi (Western Hebei) and other places have overcome various difficulties and are rushing to hoe for the second time. The fifth district of Wanping is very close to Mentougou, a stronghold of the Chiang bandits. At the end of May, it suffered from bandit burning, killing, and looting, and the masses faced many difficulties, which greatly affected their production enthusiasm. The democratic government immediately allocated 20,000 jin of millet to help more than 460 disaster-stricken households, and the emotions of the masses began to stabilize. It also rectified the militia joint defense to provide armed cover for the masses' summer hoeing. Now, villages such as Dongxiaoqu and Nanxiaoqu have completed the second hoeing in fifteen or sixteen days, and some are hoeing for the third time. Households lacking food in Xixiaoqu are combining sales and transportation with weeding to solve their difficulties. Zhuanghu Village sends five or six people out for transportation and sales every day, with old men, children, and women hoeing the land. In the second district, five households including Li Zhenghou from Huangtutai Village organized a medicinal material collection team to transport and sell to Changwan (Changping and Wanping), generating a total income of more than 2.1 million yuan for the village, solving the summer hoeing grain and salt problems for households lacking food. In Liulinshui Village in the fourth district, more than 300 men and women in the village were organized to support the front, and the labor allocation team hoed the land for those who went to support the front, and the war service workers recorded work points for the allocated workers. Ninety percent of the village's land has been hoeed. In Gougezhuang, the fifth district of Laishui, military dependent Ma Xiuying and men exchanged labor, overcoming the difficulty of lacking labor, and the first two hoeings were completed through labor exchange, saving a lot of substitute labor. In Shipian Village, the second district of Huailai, labor allocation for weeding has been implemented, and production efficiency has doubled. In the past, one person hoeed one mu to one and a half mu of seedlings a day, but after labor allocation, everyone exceeded one and a half mu per day, so labor allocation production is very enthusiastic. The village militia is also divided into seven labor allocation teams, responsible for weeding and guarding at the same time, hoeing 260 mu of land in four days. In Shangshipu Village, Fangshan, most of the male laborers went out to sell labor, and the second hoeing was done by people at home and women and children, and now more than half of the village's land has been hoeed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服各种困难平西普锄二遍\n\n1948-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　克服各种困难平西普锄二遍\n    【察哈尔电】平西各地克服种种困难，突击锄二遍。宛平五区距蒋匪据点门头沟很近，五月底遭匪烧杀抢掠，群众困难重重，生产情绪受到很大影响。民主政府当即拨出二万斤小米，救济受灾户四百六十多家，群众情绪开始安定。又整顿了民兵联防，武装掩护群众夏锄。现东小区、南小区等村，在十五、六天当中，都把二遍锄完，有的正在锄三遍。西小区缺吃户在锄苗中结合运销解决困难。庄户村每天都出去五、六个人作运销，由老头、小孩、妇女锄地。二区黄土台村李正厚等五户，组织了收药材小组，往昌宛运销出口，全村共收入二百一十多万元，解决了缺吃户的夏锄粮食和吃盐问题。四区柳林水村，在支前中组织起全村男女三百多人，由拨工组给出去支前的人锄地，再由战勤工内给拨工人记工，全村土地已锄完了百分之九十。涞水五区勾各庄军属马秀英，和男子变工，克服了缺乏劳力的困难，变工锄完头二遍，节省下不少代耕工。怀来二区石片村实行拨工锄苗，生产效率提高一倍。过去一人一天锄苗一亩到亩半，拨工后每天每人都超过一亩半，因此拨工生产很热烈。该村民兵也分成七个拨工组，一面拨工锄地，一面负责警戒，四天内锄地二百六十亩。房山上石铺村大部分男劳动力都出去卖工，即由在家的人和妇女儿童们锄二遍，现在已锄了全村土地的一半以上。"

    "content": "[Jizhong Electric] Bafang Village is a poor village in Anguo County. The whole village has 272 households, 1,252 people, and 3,346 mu of land (more than 1,001 mu of irrigated land, more than 1,044 mu of dry land, and 1,300 mu of alkaline land), averaging 2.66 mu per person. The whole village has 249.5 male laborers (including 81 semi-laborers), averaging 13.14 mu of land per person. There are 70 head of draught animals, averaging 47.8 mu of land per head. There are 20 waterwheels and 107 wells. With a large population and little land, and poor soil quality, the annual output is far from sufficient. Last year, the village harvested more than 3,526 shi of grain; the village needs at least 3,467 shi of grain annually. After paying public grain, there is still a shortage of 359 shi. In the past, except for four landlord households, fourteen rich peasant households, and thirteen well-to-do middle peasant households, no one in the village had enough to eat. The whole village averages a shortage of six months of firewood.\n\nDue to the correction of \"leftist\" deviations, such as the idea of struggling against the rich among the middle peasants, the burden policy that only considers the actual output of the current year regardless of diligence or laziness, with more burden for more harvest and less burden for less harvest, and the parasitic ideas of relying on struggle and relief, the masses' production enthusiasm in the village began to rise, and sideline occupations also began to develop. Two hundred people in the village know how to use a saw, and there are thirteen bricklayers and kiln workers. Jointly operated businesses include 23 lumber mills, four cotton ginning houses, two households pulling carts for hire, and those engaged in transportation and sales. Women are very active in production. The whole village has 331 female laborers, 290 spinning wheels, and 70 looms. Many families' pocket money and clothing are mostly solved by women's spinning and weaving. According to imprecise calculations, sideline income accounts for half of the village's total income.\n\nHow were these production achievements obtained?\n\nThis is because the branch began to attach importance to production leadership after correcting deviations, and party members and cadres actively took the lead. After the land reform in the village, the branch took leading large-scale production as the central task. A village production committee was established. The district cadre stationed in the village, in coordination with the branch, convened a meeting of all party members and cadres, calling on party members and cadres to organize themselves and take the lead in production. First, they should do a good job in their own production, and then each person should find some targets to specifically help and organize. A relatively detailed study was made at the meeting, where everyone raised their difficulties and came up with solutions. After the party's internal thinking was unified, a meeting of peasant association members and the entire village masses was convened, and individual masses were talked to, promoting that they should be organized to produce: \"We, the emancipated peasants, have land and production tools, so we should actively produce to get rich. Only by developing production can we ensure thorough emancipation. Otherwise, we will still inevitably suffer from poverty.\" While publicizing, they began to organize. Liu Fenglin, the director of the peasant association, Liu Laodui, the organization committee member of the branch, and ten other households took the lead in organizing. In the past, there was a shortage of labor, and agriculture and sideline occupations could not be taken care of. Organization saved labor. Not only did they do a good job in the fields, but they also had five surplus laborers to open lumber mills, saw wood, go to kilns, and engage in transportation and sales, earning a lot of money. They took out 3.3 million yuan (border currency, same below) from their earnings to buy a waterwheel; opening a lumber mill solved the firewood problem. When the peasants saw this living fact, they all envied and said: \"Look how convenient it is to be organized, the crops are not delayed, and they also make money. One person always takes care of this and can't take care of that! Let's organize ourselves too!\" The leadership seized this demand of the masses, widely publicized the situation of the Liu Fenglin group, and mobilized everyone to organize. Of the 62 party members in the village, 46 participated in mutual aid teams. Many masses also organized.\n\nWhen the branch found the correct direction to organize production, many masses had many ideological concerns. This was due to the \"leftist\" deviations in past work, mainly struggling against middle peasants, not paying attention to policies in all work, especially the burden policy, and the style of coercion and command. For example, some middle peasants were afraid of \"large-scale collectivization\" after the land reform, some were afraid of being struggled against after living a good life and becoming prosperous, and some were afraid of the burden increasing if the crops grew well. Some poor peasants relied on government loans and did not actively think about production on their own. The branch wanted to carry out production, but it immediately encountered this major obstacle, so it vigorously publicized that it would resolutely not infringe on the interests of middle peasants, and persuaded the masses to return the things of the three middle peasant households that were obviously wrongly struggled against. When the middle peasants saw that the wrongly struggled things were really returned, they began to feel at ease. This year's wheat requisition was also collected according to the border government's instructions, that is, according to the long-term expected yield, which further stabilized and improved everyone's production enthusiasm. The villagers said: \"It is more dignified to be diligent and thrifty. If you harvest more grain, you don't have to pay more burden. Laziness is both embarrassing and conspicuous.\" In order to reward and inspire labor mutual aid, the poor peasant association used 16 million yuan of floating wealth to buy seven large cattle, plus five mules and nine large carts that were struggled out, and lent them to the mutual aid teams for use. Whoever organized would be helped. For those who were really in difficulty, the government provided loan assistance. The whole village issued 5.2 million yuan in water conservancy loans, combined with some private capital, repaired five waterwheels, bought a new waterwheel, and repaired two wells. This broke the masses' misconception that the superiors \"only talked but did not solve practical difficulties.\"\n\nThe village used high-pitched loudspeakers, blackboards, and schools to introduce production methods from other places, commend production models, and good mutual aid teams; and urged and educated lazy people, which received good results. The lazy man Cheng Zhaoshuan loved to eat, gamble, and whore. After he was broadcasted on the radio station without naming him, he immediately said: \"I must change in the future.\" Now Cheng Zhaoshuan has joined the mutual aid team and is actively producing.\n\nThe mutual aid team adopted the practice of the masses freely forming teams and setting their own rules. Entry and exit from the team are completely free and never forced; the mutual aid methods and regulations are determined by the masses themselves and are not required to be uniform. In this way, the masses rushed to find partners to form teams. Liu Laowen said: \"Those who organized earlier have benefited.\" Some said: \"Whoever cannot get mutual aid has no popularity.\"\n\nAt present, there are 23 teams in the village, with 116 households, accounting for 42.6% of the total number of households in the village. The 589 people participating in the mutual aid teams account for 40% of the total population of the village (including organized full male laborers, accounting for 57% of the total number of full male laborers in the village). The 1,314 mu of land that has been organized accounts for 39% of the total land in the village. The 26 livestock that have been organized account for 37% of the total livestock.\n\nAfter being organized, in addition to agricultural mutual aid, sideline production was also carried out. Opening a lumber mill solved 141,300 jin of firewood (calculated at the current market price, equivalent to 70.65 million yuan), obtaining 4,730 jin of rice and a profit of 54.43 million yuan.\n\nThe situation of Bafang's organization illustrates several issues: (1) To carry out production, we must first correct deviations (if there are deviations). Correcting deviations is active, not passive. Only when the masses truly grasp the party's correct policies can the society be stable, all classes be united, and everyone be willing to carry out production. Many places advocate production, but production is always not energetic. One of the main reasons is that deviations are not corrected, and even intentionally covered up. (2) For poor villages to organize production, agriculture and sideline occupations must be combined so that labor can be fully utilized, income can be increased, and the masses' living difficulties can be appropriately resolved, so that agriculture and sideline occupations are not delayed. (3) Labor mutual aid must follow the principles of voluntariness and equal value and mutual benefit, otherwise it will not be consolidated and will collapse. However, equal value must be suitable for the masses' psychology and can only work if discussed by the masses themselves. It must be gradually improved on the basis of the masses' emotional combination and natural equal value, so that no one suffers losses. (4) To organize mutual aid, labor, livestock, capital, and technology must be combined to achieve multi-party combination, so that it can be consolidated and developed smoothly.\n\nEditor's note: After the land reform, the Bafang Village branch immediately shifted its work direction to large-scale production and found that correcting \"leftist\" deviations, straightening out various policies, stabilizing social order, and improving the masses' production enthusiasm were prerequisites for carrying out the large-scale production movement. These are all correct. However, the remnants of \"leftist\" deviations still exist. For example, without any procedures, the poor peasant association arbitrarily distributed the fruits of the whole village's collective wealth to mutual aid teams that did not include all the peasants, and only helped those who organized, which of course means that there was no voluntariness or equal value. The Bafang Village branch is expected to make efforts to correct such things.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 八方村纠正左偏解除农民顾虑　党员干部作出样子推动全村组织生产\n\n1948-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　八方村纠正左偏解除农民顾虑\n  　党员干部作出样子推动全村组织生产\n    【冀中电】八方村是安国的一个穷村，全村共有二百七十二户，一千二百五十二口人，三千三百四十六亩地（水地一千零一亩多，旱地一千零四十四亩多，碱地一千三百亩），每人平均二·六六亩。全村男劳动力二百四十九个半（内有半劳力八十一个），平均每人种地十三·一四亩。耕畜七○头，平均每头耕地四十七亩八分。水车二十辆，水井一○七眼。人多地少，地质又坏，每年产量远不够用。去年全村共收获粮食三千五百二十六石多；全村每年最少需粮三千四百六十七石，出了公粮负担，尚缺三五九石。过去村里除四户地主、十四户富农、十三户富裕中农外，没有一户够吃的。全村平均缺六个月的烧柴。\n    由于纠正了左倾偏向，如斗争中农的斗富思想，不管勤懒只按当年实际产量，收多负担多、收少负担少的负担政策，以及靠斗争靠救济吃饭的二流子思想等，该村群众生产情绪开始高起来，副业也开始发达起来。全村会拉锯的有二百人，泥瓦工、窑工十三人。合伙经营的买卖计有二十三座木厂，四个轧花房，两户拉脚的，还有跑运销的。妇女生产很积极，全村女劳动力三百三十一个，纺车二百九十辆，织布机七十张，许多人家的零花穿衣，多从妇女纺织中解决，据不精确的计算，副业收入占全村总收入的一半。\n    这些生产成绩是怎样得来的呢？\n    这是由于支部在纠偏以后，开始重视生产领导，党员干部积极带头。该村土改后，支部就以领导大生产为中心工作。成立了村生产委员会。住村的区干部协同支部召开了全体党员干部会议，号召党员干部组织起来带头生产。首先把自己的生产搞好，每个人再找一些对象，具体帮助与组织。会上作了比较精细的研究，由大家提出各自的困难，想出了解决的办法。党内思想统一了，接着召开了农会会员和全村群众大会，又和个别群众漫谈，宣传应该组织起来生产：“我们翻身农民有了土地、生产工具，就应该积极生产发家致富，只有发展生产，才能保证彻底翻身。否则还是免不了受穷。”一面宣传，一面着手组织。农会主任刘凤林、支部组织委员刘老对等十户先组织起来。过去劳力缺乏，农副业不能兼顾。组织起来省了工，不但把地里活作好，还节余了五个劳动力开木厂、拉锯、上窑、跑运销，赚钱很多。他们把赚的钱抽出三百三十万元（边币，下同）买了一辆水车；开木厂解决了烧柴问题。农民们看见这个活生生的事实，都羡慕的说：“看人家组织起来多方便，庄稼误不了，又赚了钱。一个人总是顾了这照顾不了那呀！咱们也组织起来吧！”领导上抓住群众这种要求，广泛宣传刘凤林小组的情况，动员大家组织起来，全村六十二个党员，有四十六个参加了互助组。许多群众也组织起来了。\n    当支部找到了正确方向组织生产的开始，不少群众存在着不少的思想顾虑，这是历年来工作中的左倾偏向，主要是斗中农，一切工作不讲求政策，特别是负担政策，以及强迫命令的作风所致。比如有些中农怕土改后“大合伙”，有的怕过好了日子即生活富裕后再被斗，有的怕庄稼长好了负担加多。有些贫农依赖政府贷款，自己不积极想法生产。支部要进行生产，但拍头就碰见了这一大障碍，便大力宣传，坚决不侵犯中农利益，并说服群众，将显然是错斗的三户中农的东西退了回去。中农看见错斗的真退回去了，心里才开始有了底子。今年的麦征又按照边府指示，即按长年应产量征收，更稳定与提高了大家的生产情绪，老乡们都说：“看勤俭了多体面，多打了粮食，不多拿负担，懒了既丢人又显眼。”为了奖励与启发劳动互助，贫农团用浮财一千六百万元，买了七头大牛，再加上斗争出来的五个骡子、九辆大车，也借给了互助组使用。谁组织起来就帮助谁。对真正困难的，政府予以贷款帮助，全村共发放水利贷款五百二十万元，结合一部私资，修理了五辆水车，买了一辆新水车，修理了两眼井。打破了群众认为上级“光动嘴不解决实际困难”的错觉。\n    该村利用高房广播、黑板报和学校，介绍别处生产办法，表扬生产模范，和好的互助组；对懒汉懒婆进行督促教育，收到了很好的效果。懒汉程造拴爱吃爱赌爱嫖，在广播台上不指名的广播了他以后，他立刻表示：“今后一定要改了。”现在程造拴已参加了互助组，积极生产起来。\n    互助组采用了群众自由结组，自定制度的作法。出入组完全自由，绝不强迫；互助办法章程由群众自己规定，不强求一致。这样一来，群众便纷纷找对象结组，刘老温说：“先组织起来的沾光了”。有的说：“谁互助不起来就是没有人缘。”\n    目前全村共有二十三组，一百一十六户。占全村总户数的百分之四二·六。参加互助组的五百八十九人，占全村总人口的百分之四十（内有组织起来的整男劳力，占全村男整劳力的百分之五十七）。组织起来的土地共一三一四亩，占全村总地数百分之三十九。组织起来的牲口二十六个，占总牲口数的百分之三十七。\n    组织起来后，除农业互助外，还开展副业生产，开木厂解决烧柴十四万一千三百斤（按当前市价，折款为七千零六十五万元），得米四千七百三十斤，获利五千四百四十三万元。\n    八方组织起来的情况说明了几个问题：（一）要想进行生产，首先必须进行纠偏（如果有偏的话），纠偏是积极的不是消极的，让群众真正掌握了党的正确政策后，才能使社会安定，各阶层团结，大家才愿意进行生产。许多地方提倡生产，但总是生产不起劲，主要原因之一就是有偏不纠，甚至有意的掩盖偏。（二）穷村组织生产必须农副业相结合，劳动力才能得到高度的发挥，增加收入，群众生活困难才能得到适当解决，才能做到农副两不误。（三）劳动互助，必须依照自愿和等价两利的原则，否则就不会巩固而会垮台。但等价必须适合群众的心理，由群众自己讨论才能行得通。必须在群众感情结合和自然等价的基础上逐步提高，作到互不吃亏。（四）组织互助，必须人畜力相结合，资本与技术相结合，作到多方结合，才能巩固和顺利的发展。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    编者按：八方村支部在土改后就立即把工作方向转入大生产，并找到了纠正左倾偏向，端正各种政策，安定社会秩序，提高群众生产情绪，为开展大生产运动的先决条件，这都是正确的。但左倾偏向的残余依然存在，如未经任何手续，贫农团便独断专行的把全村共有的果实浮财分给了并不包括全体农民的互助组使用，而且是谁组织起来才帮助谁，这当然也就谈不到自愿等价了。诸如此类，望八方村支部努力予以纠正。"

Most areas of the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 9th districts have been thoroughly soaked. Although some areas have not been completely soaked, they are wet to a depth of one plow, allowing for planting. All localities are actively carrying out crash planting after the rain. In Fanxian and Yanggu counties, after the rain fell, a mobilization was carried out during the ongoing conference for electing representatives to the North China People's Congress, requiring the representatives to return and participate in and lead the crash planting effort. The county committee also called on all cadres to go deep into the villages, patiently understand and help the masses solve difficulties such as livestock, farm tools, and seeds. In Puyang County, after the heavy rain, the entire county immediately shifted from spot planting and watering seedlings to crash planting. As soon as the rain stopped, the county committee convened a meeting of cadres from all county-level agencies, mobilizing them to lead and organize the masses to crash plant. It was stipulated that: (1) All county-level agencies, except for a few cadres who remain to maintain work, should be assigned to villages to lead the masses in crash planting; (2) For families of military personnel and martyrs who lack labor, the masses should be mobilized to help them plant together, ensuring that not an acre of land is left uncultivated. On the same afternoon, the cadres of the county agencies went to various districts. On the second day after the rain began (the 19th), the Guancheng County Committee instructed all districts to concentrate all efforts on crash planting. In areas where labor is scarce, people should be organized to pull seed drills, and all semi-laborers, women, children, the elderly, and the weak should be mobilized to plant sweet potatoes and corn, ensuring that no one is idle and striving to complete all planting within three to five days. In the few villages where it did not rain or where the rain was light, and where seed drills cannot be used, the masses should continue to be organized to spot plant, overcoming the phenomenon of waiting and doing nothing until it rains. The village cadre and party member training class (more than 200 people), originally scheduled to begin gathering on the afternoon of the 19th, decided to postpone the start of classes for three days, so that they could lead the masses in taking advantage of the post-rain period for crash planting.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫河北地区透雨　干部大力领导抢种\n\n1948-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫河北地区透雨\n  　干部大力领导抢种\n    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫黄河以北地区自十八日下午开始降雨，迄二十一日始晴。四、六、八、九分区均大部地区下透了，小部地区虽未下透，也有一犁深，可以下种。各地都在积极进行雨后抢种。范（县）阳（谷）两县落雨后，在正开着的选举华北人民代表的会议上作了动员，要求代表们回去即参加与领导突击抢种。县委会并号召所有干部深入到村，耐心了解和帮助群众解决牲口、耕具、种籽等困难。濮县下了透雨，全县即从点种浇苗工作转为抢种。刚住了雨，县委会即召开县一级各机关干部大会，动员领导与组织群众抢种，并规定：（１）县一级机关除留几个干部坚持工作外，一律分到村去领导群众抢种；（２）对无劳力的军工烈属发动群众帮助他们一块种，保证不荒一亩地。当日下午县机关干部即分头到各区去。观城县委会在开始下雨的第二天（十九日），就指示各区，集中全力进行抢种。在劳力缺乏的地方应组织人拉耧，动员一切半劳力，妇女儿童老弱都下手栽红薯、点棒子，作到不闲一人，争取三五天内全部完成抢种。少部分没下雨或雨小的村庄，不能耧地的，则继续组织群众点种，克服等雨不下手的现象。原计划十九日下午开始集合的村干党员训练班（二百余人）决定延期三天开课，使他们能够领导群众，乘雨后突击抢种。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, July 24th: Recently, North China University, expanded from the merger of North China United University and Northern University, with over two thousand teachers and students, telegraphed the All-China Student Federation, cultural circles, and compatriots from all walks of life, protesting the Jiang-Fu bandit gang's crime of shooting and killing students from Northeast China in Beiping. They also welcomed students and educators from cultural circles across Beiping, Tianjin, and the entire country oppressed by the Jiang bandits to come to the Liberated Areas to study and participate in the various tasks of building a new China. The telegram was led by Principal Wu Yuzhang, Vice Principals Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, and Dean of Studies Qian Junrui. The telegram stated: The \"July 5th\" massacre most fully and typically demonstrated how the reactionary ruling group of Chiang Kai-shek, under the instigation and support of American imperialism, hung the sheep's head of democratic constitutionalism while selling the dog meat of bloody fascist terror rule. History tells people that any reactionary ruler's brutal suppression of the masses can only demonstrate that their rule is on the verge of destruction. The \"March 18th\" massacre twenty-two years ago was a prelude to the total collapse of the Northern Warlords a year later, and the \"July 5th\" massacre is also a prediction of the rapid demise of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Today, China already has 160 million people, who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are diligently and selflessly carrying out the construction of new democratic politics, economy, and cultural education. Contrary to the KMT-controlled areas, in the Liberated Areas, young students and comrades in cultural and educational circles not only have food to eat, clothes to wear, and houses to live in, but also have books to read and books to teach. Thousands upon thousands of students from the KMT-controlled areas have been and are pouring into the Liberated Areas. The democratic government guarantees them sufficient food and clothing with public funds and grain. At the same time, due to the vigorous development of various constructions in the Liberated Areas, it is also guaranteed that everyone has a job and a career after finishing their studies in school. We warmly welcome a large number of young students and colleagues in cultural, educational, and scientific circles to come to the Liberated Areas to participate in teaching, learning, and various construction works. The doors of North China University are open to you. We first extend our cordial fraternal hand to you.\n\nXinhua News Agency, North China, July 22nd: According to Tianjin newspapers, four hundred and four professors from universities in Beiping, including Tsinghua, Peking University, and Yenching University, jointly issued a declaration protesting the Jiang-Fu bandit gang's crime of manufacturing the \"July 5th blood case\" and massacring students from Northeast China. The declaration began by stating: \"We, the professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and teachers of various universities in Beiping, unanimously lodge the most solemn and serious protest to the government for the 'July 5th blood case.'\" The declaration pointed out: \"The (Chiang) government announced the establishment of Temporary Universities and Temporary Middle Schools without any prior preparation. School buildings, funding, teachers, and equipment were all castles in the air. Afterwards, they repeatedly shirked and perfunctorily dealt with the matter, failing to provide reasonable treatment and comfort, causing thousands of young people to wander the streets, enduring hunger all day long, with a painful situation beyond description, arousing public outrage; and the Beiping Municipal Council further stimulated the situation on the 4th by passing a proposal forcing students to join the army, causing the youth who had suffered greatly to petition the speaker.\" The declaration put forward six demands to the Jiang government: \"1. Thoroughly investigate responsibility. 2. Immediately hand over all the bodies of the dead for burial, treat and compensate the injured, and bear the living expenses of the disabled for life. 3. Immediately release the arrested Northeast students and lift the siege and blockade of their residences. 4. Revoke the Beiping Municipal Council's proposal on Northeast students. 5. Expedite relief to Northeast students. 6. Ensure that the same bloody case will not happen again in the future.\" Those who signed the declaration included Zuo Zonglun, Zhu Ziqing, Li Guangtian, Huang Guozhang, Ma Jian, Lu Bao'che, Li Changzhi, Yuan Hanqing, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Xiruo, Zhang Boju, Liang Sicheng, Deng Yizhe, Fu Hansi (foreigner), Xu Deheng, Fei Qing, Fu Jun, Wu Han, and others, totaling four hundred and four people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北大学通电全国抗议“七五”大惨案  平四百教授发表沉痛宣言\n\n1948-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华北大学通电全国抗议“七五”大惨案\n    平四百教授发表沉痛宣言\n    【新华社华北二十四日电】最近由华北联合大学与北方大学合并扩大而成的华北大学，全体师生二千余人通电全国学联、文化界及各界同胞，抗议蒋、傅匪帮枪杀东北来平学生罪行，并欢迎平津及全国受蒋匪压迫的学生和教育界文化界人士，到解放区来学习，参加建设新中国的各项工作。通电由校长吴玉章、副校长范文澜、成仿吾、教务长钱俊瑞等领衔。电文略称：“七五”大惨案最充分和最典型地表现了蒋介石反动统治集团，如何在美帝国主义的指使和支持下，挂着民主宪政的羊头，卖着血腥的法西斯恐怖统治的狗肉。历史昭示人们，任何反动统治者，对人民大众的凶残镇压，都只能表现其统治濒于复灭的边缘。二十二年前“三一八”惨案是一年以后北洋军阀总崩溃的预告，“七五”大惨案也正是预告蒋介石集团的迅速败亡。今天中国已经有了一万万六千万人民，在中国共产党的领导下，勤勤恳恳，和奋不顾身地进行着新民主主义的政治、经济、和文化教育的建设。和蒋管区相反，解放区的青年学生和文化教育界同志，不但人人有饭吃、有衣穿、有房住，而且人人有书可读，有书可教。成千成万的蒋管区学生，曾经和正在涌入解放区。他们由民主政府用公款公粮保证其足衣足食。同时因为解放区各项建设的猛烈开展，又保证他们在学校学习终了以后，人人有工作，人人有职业。我们热烈地欢迎大批青年同学和文化界教育界科学界的同人，来到解放区，参加教、学和各项建设工作。华北大学的门，是为你们开着的，我们首先向你们伸出亲切的同胞兄弟姊妹之手。\n    【新华社华北二十二日电】据天津报纸登载：北平清华、北大、燕京等大学教授四百零四人联名发表抗议蒋傅匪帮制造“七、五血案”屠杀东北学生罪行的宣言，宣言首称：“我们北平各大学教授、讲师、助教、教员同人一致为‘七、五血案’向政府提出最沉痛、最严重的抗议”。宣言指出：“（蒋）政府宣布成立临大、临中，事先毫无准备，校舍、经费、师资、设备一切都是空中楼阁。事后多方推托敷衍，未能予以合理待遇和安抚，致使数千青年飘泊街头，忍饿终日，痛苦情况不堪言状，群情愤激，舆论哗然；而平市参议会又于四日加以刺激，通过议案强迫学生从军，致使饱经痛苦的青年向议长请愿。”该宣言向蒋政府提出六项要求：“一、彻底追究责任。二、立即交出所有死者尸体安葬、伤者治疗抚恤、负担残废者终身生活费用。三、立即释放被捕东北学生，取消对其住处的包围及封锁。四、撤消平市参议会对东北学生的议案。五、从速救济东北学生。六、确保今后不再发生同样血案。”签署该宣言者计有左宗纶、朱自清、李广田、黄国璋、马坚、鲁宝车、李长之、袁翰青、张东荪、张奚若、张伯驹、梁思成、邓以蛰、傅汉思（外籍）、许德珩、费青、傅钧、吴晗等共四百零四人。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Ninth Sub-district Branch of the Border Region Bank has achieved great success in issuing agricultural loans over the past four months. As of the end of June, a total of 8,254,150,000 yuan (border currency) has been issued, along with over 630,000 catties of grain. This has supported the masses in digging 3,920 new wells, repairing 14,300 old wells, purchasing 1,498 waterwheels, repairing 1,404 waterwheels, and purchasing 1,571 head of livestock (the above figures do not include purchases and repairs made independently using floating assets). 6,292 various production teams have been organized. This round of agricultural loans has the following characteristics: (1) It implemented the spirit of prioritizing water conservancy. Water conservancy loans accounted for 47% of the total agricultural loans, agriculture accounted for 29.5%, and sideline production accounted for 23.5%. In counties where water conservancy work was carried out relatively well (such as Anguo), the water conservancy portion accounted for 80.5%. Xinle, Anping, and Shenze were all around 50% or 60%. (2) When issuing agricultural loans, attention was paid to organizing private capital and floating assets. In April, 311,340,000 yuan of private capital and floating assets were organized, and in May, 1,139,450,000 yuan were organized. In June, Anguo issued a total of 1,946,610,000 yuan in loans and organized 2,798,120,000 yuan in private capital and floating assets, exceeding the loan amount. (3) There was a shift away from the simple perspective of only lending to poor peasants and hired laborers without lending to middle peasants and other classes, instead of focusing on non-productive relief, with the goal of lending to help peasants of all classes with production. In Anguo in April and May, there were 3,496 loan recipients, of which 2,476 were poor peasants (accounting for over 70% of the total), and 1,020 were middle peasants (over 29%); loans to poor peasants accounted for 76%, and loans to middle peasants accounted for 24%. (4) The spirit of lending actual goods at actual value was implemented. In sideline production, loans were provided for cotton and saltpeter pots; in agriculture, loans were provided for grain; in water conservancy, the Anguo Promotion Society lent out 60 waterwheels. The Shenze Promotion Society supported the establishment of eight kilns, which produced more than 300,000 bricks in May, solving the problem of bricks for well digging. Since the district party committee called for loans to be based on actual value in May, by the end of June, according to statistics from four counties, over 900 million yuan had been converted to actual value, and 299,909 catties of grain. The sub-district also faces some urgent problems in its lending work. In the issuance of loans, some cadres still hold non-productive relief views and have not fully grasped that loans are for the development of production and should mainly be given to poor and middle peasants who are actively producing but have more difficulties, while also lending to landlords and rich peasants who are willing to engage in production. In Anguo's Fourth District, water conservancy loans were not given to middle peasants; in a well-digging team in the Fifth District, two members were originally rich peasants, and the entire team was therefore unable to obtain a loan. Many agricultural loan cadres have not distinguished between loans and relief, and have the idea of using loans to \"fill poverty pits.\" Some villages have few floating assets, so they use loans to fill the gap, and agricultural loans cannot truly play a role in supporting production. Some cadres do not understand that loans should be continuous and frequently rotated in order to play their due role in supporting production, and do not pay enough attention to the inspection and recovery of agricultural loans; some people have used water conservancy loans to build houses, and a few have even used loans for gambling. Regarding the development of mass credit cooperation, many agricultural loan cadres are still unclear. They do not understand that the fundamental way to truly and universally solve the financial difficulties of the masses is to use loans to help establish new borrowing and lending relationships among the masses and to carry out mass credit cooperation movements. They only complain that the agricultural loans distributed from above are too few, and do not pay attention to organizing village cooperatives, or to trying out mass credit cooperative organizations in a planned and focused manner.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 发展水利扶植农副业　冀中九分区银行农贷有成绩\n\n1948-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　发展水利扶植农副业\n  　冀中九分区银行农贷有成绩\n    【冀中电】边区银行冀中九分区支行，四个月来发放农贷收到很大成绩。截至六月底，共发出八十二亿五千四百一十五万元（边币，下同）。贷出粮食六十三万余斤。扶植群众打新井三千九百二十眼，修旧井一万四千三百眼；买水车一千四百九十八辆，修理水车一千四百零四辆，买牲口一千五百七十一头。（以上未包括单独用浮财购买及修理数），组织各种生产小组六千二百九十二个。这次发放农贷有以下几个特点：（一）贯彻了以水利为重点的精神。水利贷款占农贷总数百分之四十七，农业占百分之二十九点五，副业占百分之二三点五。水利工作开展较好的县份（如安国），水利部分占百分之八十点五。新乐、安平、深泽均在百分之五、六十左右。（二）发放农贷时，注意了组织私资与浮财。四月份组织私资浮财三亿一千一百三十四万元，五月份组织私资浮财达十一亿三千九百四十五万元。六月份安国共贷款十九亿四千六百六十一万元，组织私资浮财二十七亿九千八百一十二万元，超过了贷款数。（三）开始转变了单纯贫雇观点，只贷款给贫雇不贷给中农及其他阶层的非生产的救济，作到贷款帮助各阶层农民生产。安国四、五月份贷款户为三四九六户，其中贫农二四七六户（占总户数百分之七十强），中农一零二零户（百分之二十九强）；贫农贷款占百分之七十六，中农贷款占百分之二十四。（四）贯彻了贷实折实的精神。在副业上贷棉、贷硝锅，在农业上贷粮食；在水利上，安国推进社贷出水车六十辆。深泽推进社扶植起八个窑，五月份制成三十余万砖，解决了打井用砖的问题。贷款自五月份区党委号召贷款折实后，至六月底，据四个县统计，已折实九亿余元，折粮二九九九零九斤。该分区在贷款工作上，同时还存在一些急待解决的问题。发放贷款中，某些干部仍然存在非生产的救济观点，没有很好掌握贷款是为了发展生产，主要是贷给积极生产困难较多的贫雇中农，同时也贷给愿意生产的地主富农的原则。安国四区在水利贷款时不贷给中农；五区一村打井组，其中有两个原富农成份，全组因此未贷到款。有许多农贷干部未分清贷款和救济的区别，存在着用贷款“填穷坑”的想法。有些村庄浮财少，就以贷款填补，农贷不能真正发挥扶持生产的作用。有些干部不懂得贷款应川流不息，经常周转，才能起扶值生产的应有作用，对农贷的检查与收回工作重视不够，有人借了水利贷款盖了房子，少数人甚至以贷款赌钱。关于开展群众信用合作问题，许多农贷干部还认识不清。不懂得真正普遍解决群众资金的困难，基本方法是以贷款帮助建立群众新的借贷关系，开展群众信用合作运动，只是抱怨上面分下来的农贷太少，对村社却不注意整理，或有计划，有重点的试办群众信用合作组织。"

In the six villages of Muzi Port, Longmen Gully, and Huangtuzui in the first district, there is a large amount of mountainous land and little cultivated land, with an average of only 1.6 mu per person. There is a large output of mountain products and medicinal materials. In this area, it is required to greatly develop animal husbandry, reclaim wasteland to grow vegetables, expand the cultivated land area, and make extensive use of slack seasons to cut mountain products (such as hoe handles, wolfberries, mountain willow, medicinal materials, and mountain walnuts), and systematically plant trees and afforest. In the western half of the first district, in the fifteen villages such as Huangluotuo and Luqingling, there is plenty of land but a lack of fertilizer, fuel, and water. The twenty-five villages in the second district have plenty of land, but the output is not high, and there is a shortage of fuel; grapes and fruits are abundant. In these two regions, intensive cultivation and careful farming are required, as well as the construction of flood discharge canals, in order to increase output; fruit trees and grapes should be planted, and the transportation industry should be developed. In the fourth and fifth districts, the front-line area, the environment is relatively turbulent, and the enemy frequently comes out to harass. This area produces a large number of fruits (such as the famous Huailai apples), and the general public can weave baskets. In this area, it is required to continue to eliminate fruit insects (this year's insect infestation is serious), develop sideline occupations, implement the combination of labor and military affairs, and breed fruit forests. In the ten villages of Zhuanghu and the southern five villages of the third district, red dates and vitex are abundant, and most people can weave baskets. In this area, it is required to develop weaving and promote the planting of dates and grapes. The current specific work that the county party committee has decided on is: (1) Mobilize all the masses to weed twice to ensure that they weed three times this year, and in some areas, they can weed four times. Those who lack seedlings should immediately plant them. (2) Eliminate wasteland and universally plant vegetables, buckwheat, and other late-maturing crops. (3) Truly grasp the disaster situation, establish the masses' ideology of overcoming famine through production, and make full use of grain and loan assistance to help the masses overcome the famine through production. (4) Carry out the green manure pressing movement to solve next year's fertilizer difficulties. Seize the gaps to build flood discharge canals. (5) Go deep into the guerrilla areas and marginal areas to understand the demands of the masses, help the masses produce, implement the combination of labor and military affairs, and protect the masses in production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 根据不同地区确定不同重点　怀来县委具体领导生产\n\n1948-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　根据不同地区确定不同重点\n  　怀来县委具体领导生产\n    【察哈尔电】怀来县委按照县里四种不同地区的具体情况，规定领导生产的不同重点。一区木子港、龙门沟、黄土嘴等六村，山大地少，每人只平均一亩六分地，山货药材出产很多。在这种地区要求大量发展牧畜业、开荒种菜，扩大耕地面积，利用农闲大量砍山货（如镐柄、杞子、山柳、药材、山核桃），并有计划的植树造林。一区西半区黄骆驼、芦青岭等十五个村，地多缺肥、缺燃料、缺水。二区的二十五个村庄，地多而产量不高，缺燃料，盛产葡萄、果子。在这两种地区要求精耕细作，开修洪水渠，以提高产量；种植果树和葡萄，并发展运输事业。四、五区前方区一带，环境比较动荡，敌人经常出扰。该地出产大批水果（如驰名的怀来苹果），一般群众都会编筐。在这种地区要求继续消灭果虫（今年虫灾严重），发展副业，实行劳武结合，繁殖果林。一区庄户一带和三区南五村共十个村，盛产红枣、荆条，大部分人都会编筐。在这种地区要求发展编织，提倡种枣和葡萄。当前的具体工作，县委决定：（一）动员全体群众锄二遍，保证今年锄三遍，在部分地区还可锄四遍，缺苗者应立即点种。（二）消灭荒地，普遍种菜、荞麦等晚熟作物。（三）切实掌握灾情，树立群众的生产渡荒思想，充分利用贷粮贷款，帮助群众生产渡荒。（四）开展压绿肥运动，解决明年的肥料困难。抓住空隙开修洪水渠。（五）游击区与边缘区要深入下去，了解群众要求，帮助群众生产，实行劳武结合，掩护群众生产。"

Deliberative hearings were held for three days from the 6th to the 8th, presided over by a collegiate bench composed of Presiding Judge Wang Feiran and Judges Xu Yunhui and Zhang Jingshan. Both sessions were held from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM. During the trial, 35 people, including Chinese and foreign clergy and nuns from the Zhangjia Village Catholic Church in Xianxian County, as well as representatives from various regions, were present to observe. The debate concluded at 7:00 PM on the 8th. Because the evidence of the crimes committed by the criminals was conclusive, they all confessed to the crimes. At 5:30 PM on July 15th, Presiding Judge Wang Feiran formally announced the verdict. The original text of the main verdict is as follows: \"Shang Jianxun (French), Pan Rulin (French), Li Shitang (Belgian), and Mu Qihua (French) privately established a radio station to provide intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S.; moreover, Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, and Mu Qihua colluded with the Chiang bandit army to attack the liberated areas, all are expelled from China. Jia Shushan (from Renqiu, Jizhong) incited soldiers and young adults to desert and provided intelligence to Pan Rulin, sentenced to one year of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for two years. Liao Ya'er, She Yuren, Shen Zitian, Wu Huaichi, and Du Ande and other accomplices will be investigated separately. A Haller shortwave transmitter and a shortwave receiver, as well as multiple U.S.-made radio parts and seven batteries, are all confiscated.\" The verdict also stipulates that if the criminals are not satisfied, they may appeal. If no appeal is filed within the deadline, our democratic government will execute the judgment in accordance with the verdict.\n    Attached is the original indictment filed by Lu Zhiguo, Deputy Director and Prosecutor of the Jizhong Public Security Bureau, to the Jizhong Branch of the Jin-Cha-Ji Higher Court:\n    Indictment by the Deputy Director and Prosecutor of the Public Security Bureau of the Jizhong Administrative Office.\n    Defendant Shang Jianxun, male, 69 years old, French national, Jesuit President and Deputy Bishop Acting Bishop of the Xianxian Diocese of the Catholic Church, in custody.

The above defendants, on the grounds of acting as spies for Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S., colluding with the Chiang bandit army, and endangering the liberated areas, have been investigated by this prosecutor, who believes that a public prosecution should be filed. The criminal facts and evidence are listed below:\n    Criminal Facts:\n    The defendant Shang Jianxun and others have long been under the protection of our democratic government, engaging in religious activities. However, they have harbored deep hostility and animosity towards the military and civilians of our liberated areas, willingly acting as spies and special agents for Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S., colluding with the Chiang bandit army to endanger the liberated areas. They have also used the guise of propagating religion to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities, determined to destroy our liberated areas before they would be satisfied. The crimes committed by the defendants are listed below:\n    (1) Secretly establishing a radio station and using various methods to supply intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. intelligence personnel stationed in Peiping and Tianjin: Since the Japanese surrender, and the arrival of Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. troops in Peiping and Tianjin, the defendant Shen Zitian first established a relationship with U.S. military intelligence personnel stationed in Tianjin in the autumn of 1945. Later, the defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua and others also accepted the intelligence mission of Mao De, a U.S. liaison officer stationed in Tianjin in January 1946. The defendant She Yuren established a relationship with Chiang Kai-shek's special agent Lei Minggeng (also known as Er Lei) in May 1946, and passed the obtained intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek through Er Lei. The defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua, and Li Shitang secretly established a transceiver in December 1945 and January 1946, which was installed and used by Li Shitang, using the call sign \"MS\" and wavelengths of 40 and 80 meters to communicate with the \"GD\" call sign of the Tianjin radio station. All intelligence was then transferred by the defendant Liao Ya'er, who was stationed in Peiping and Tianjin, to U.S. intelligence personnel stationed in Peiping and Tianjin (sometimes through U.S. military priests). Since the installation of the radio station, the military and political situation of the liberated areas has been continuously reported. For example, before each battle, the movements of our troops and stretchers, the participation of the people in the army and troop training, as well as the location and direction of the rear agencies, were all telegraphed in a timely manner. When the Jizhong Bank Printing Factory moved its location in November 1946, the defendants immediately telegraphed the report.\n    In addition to providing intelligence via radio station, the defendants also continuously provided reports orally or in writing. For example, the defendant Shang Jianxun made several reports to Mao De in person in February of that year after accepting the intelligence mission in January 1946. He also recommended She Yuren, whom he considered to be the most knowledgeable about the liberated areas and the Chinese Communist Party, to Mao De. As a result, the defendant She Yuren went to Tianjin every two or three months under the pretext of buying medicine to give reports in person. In June 1946, Shang Jianxun went to Europe on business, and Pan Rulin was responsible for the intelligence work. After Pan Rulin discussed and strengthened the intelligence work with Liao Ya'er, it was stipulated that intelligence would be sent to Tianjin every half month. In addition to oral intelligence, Shang Jianxun, She Yuren, Shen Zitian, Du Ande, Pan Rulin and others also provided written intelligence. The above intelligence was highly valued by Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. In particular, the intelligence written by Shen Zitian on the location, number, and equipment of the People's Liberation Army was rewarded with 20 U.S. dollars. She Yuren's intelligence written to Chiang Kai-shek also received praise in a reply from Lei Minggeng. The intelligence written by the defendant Pan Rulin, which was more than 30 pages long, was even more detailed and was described by himself as an \"encyclopedia of the liberated areas.\" In addition, the defendant Wu Huaichi wrote a manuscript on the party, government, military, and economic aspects of the liberated areas, which was extremely slanderous and disparaging. The material was written from the winter of 1946 and was completed in the spring of the following year with the help of She Yuren, Jia Shushan, and Pan Rulin. Except for a part that was seized by us, the remaining part was taken to Tianjin by She Yuren.\n    (2) Colluding with the Chiang bandit army to harass the liberated areas and inciting soldiers and young people to desert: The defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Mu Qihua, and Liao Ya'er held a meeting on January 4, 1946, and decided that Liao Ya'er would go to Peiping in the name of Zhao Zhensheng, the bishop of the Xianxian Diocese, to invite Sun Lianzhong, commander of the 11th War Zone of the Chiang bandit army, to attack the liberated areas, hoping that they would occupy Xianxian and that the defendants would act as internal respondents. Sun replied: \"Units have been dispatched to pursue and suppress.\" In addition, the defendant Jia Shushan once said to eight new soldiers: \"You have a good opportunity to escape.\" He also gave two soldiers who were instigated by him to escape a note to Tianjin to withdraw money, and advised them to find work there. He also gave a new soldier a letter of introduction so that someone would take care of him in Tianjin after he deserted. In total, the defendants directly or indirectly incited more than 80 soldiers and young people to desert.\n    The Xianxian Public Security Bureau discovered the crimes committed by the defendants endangering the liberated areas in October 1947, and then arrested Shang Jianxun and others and sent them to this bureau for investigation.\n    Evidence:\n    The defendants Shang Jianxun, Pan Rulin, Li Shitang, Mu Qihua, and Jia Shushan not only confessed to the above circumstances without denying them, but also had the following seized: Pan Rulin's letter to She Yuren admitting that his intelligence must be praised by the Americans, She Yuren's letter to Er Lei requesting aerial propaganda, Er Lei's letter to She Yuren acknowledging receipt of his intelligence, Mei Huaiyi's notice to Li Shitang to establish contact with Peiping and Tianjin radio stations, with an attached wavelength call sign schedule, and Sun Lianzhong's Xiangzhi No. 322 telegram. In addition, the second half of Wu Huaichi's manuscript slandering the liberated areas is also attached to the file. In addition, a Haller shortwave transmitter and a shortwave receiver, as well as various U.S.-made radio parts and seven batteries, were also seized. This is sufficient proof that the above facts are indeed true.\n    In summary, the actions of the defendants are not only a violation of the laws and regulations of our democratic government, but also prohibited by the laws of any country, and a public prosecution should be filed immediately, and a judgment should be made according to law. Furthermore, the five defendants in custody, Shang Jianxun and others, were relatively candid in their confessions during the interrogation and have provided explanations.\n    　Respectfully submitted to\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Lu Zhiguo, Deputy Director and Prosecutor of the Public Security Bureau of the Jizhong Administrative Office\n    　Jizhong Branch of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Higher Court\n    　　　　　　　　　　Republic of China, 29th day of June, 37th year\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 献县国际间谍案正式宣判　尚建动潘汝霖等驱逐出中国\n\n1948-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　献县国际间谍案正式宣判\n  　尚建动潘汝霖等驱逐出中国\n    【新华社华北二十五日电】我冀中区公安机关去年十月二十一日在献县张家庄天主教堂破获之危害解放区的国际间谍案（详情见本社今年五月七日电讯），刻已审判完毕，于七月十五日正式宣判。该案主犯尚建勋、潘汝霖、李诗堂、穆启华被判处驱逐出中国，贾书善被判徒刑一年，褫夺公民权二年。该犯等去年经我公安机关执行逮捕后，即由冀中公安局将全部人犯、证件解送晋察冀边区高等法院冀中分院。经检查官陆治国缜密侦查后，于六月二十九日正式提起公诉。七月一日，该院正式开庭审理。一日至四日开调查庭四天，由受命推事徐蕴辉审问。六日至八日又开辩论庭三天，由审判长王斐然、推事徐蕴辉、张静山组织合议庭审问。两次开庭时间均为上午八时至十二时及下午三时至七时。开庭时有献县张家庄天主堂中外教士、修女，及各地人民代表三十五人到庭旁听。八日下午七时辩论终结。该犯等因犯罪证据确凿，对所犯罪行均供认不讳。七月十五日下午五时三十分，审判长王斐然正式宣示判决。判决主文原文如下：“尚建勋（法籍）潘汝霖（法籍）、李诗堂（比籍），穆启华（法籍），私设电台供给蒋美情报；又尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华勾结蒋匪军进攻解放区，均驱逐出中国。贾书善（冀中任邱人）煽惑士兵及青壮年逃亡，及供给潘汝霖情报，判处徒刑一年，褫夺公民权二年。廖迓迩、佘裕仁、申自天、吴怀赤、杜安德等犯获案另究。哈特来氏发报机及短波收报机各一部，美制无线电零件多件，电池七块均予没收”。判决书并规定该犯等如有不服，可提出上诉。如逾期不上诉，我民主政府即将按照判决执行。\n    附冀中公安局副局长兼检察官陆治国，向晋察冀高等法院冀中分院提起公诉之起诉书原文如下：\n    冀中行政公署公安局副局长兼检察官起诉书。\n    被告尚建勋，男，六十九岁，法国人，天主教献县教区耶苏会长兼副主教代理主教，在押。潘汝霖，男，卅五岁，法国人，天主教献县教区耶苏会理家神甫，在押。李诗堂，男，四十二岁，比国人，天主教献县教区耶苏会神甫兼圣若瑟医院医生，在押。穆启华，男，四十六岁，法国人，天主教献县教区耶苏会神甫，在押。贾书善，男，卅二岁，河北任邱人，天主教献县教区主教府理家神甫，在押。佘裕仁，男，五十三岁，法国人，天主教献县教区深县、武强、安平、饶阳传教区总本堂神甫，在逃。廖迓迩，男，四十四岁，法国人，天主教献县区耶苏会副会长，在逃。申自天，男，四十八岁，法国人，天主教献县教区河间传教区神甫，在逃。杜安德，男，四十五岁，法国人，天主教献县教区河间传教区神甫，在逃。吴怀赤，男，四十二岁，河北河间人，天主教献县教区主教府神甫，在逃。右被告等因担任蒋美间谍，勾结蒋匪军等情，危害解放区一案，业经本检察官侦查终结，认为应提起公诉。兹将其犯罪事实及证据开列于左：\n    犯罪事实：\n    被告尚建勋等，久在我民主政府保护之下，从事宗教事业。但夙对我解放区军民，深抱敌对仇视态度，竟甘当蒋美间谍特务，勾结蒋匪军，危害解放区。并假宣传宗教之名，而实施种种阴谋破坏活动，必欲摧毁我解放区而后甘心。兹将被告等所为罪行，择要列述于后：\n    （一）秘密设立电台，并用各种方法以情报供给蒋匪及驻平津美情报人员：自日本投降，蒋美军到达平、津后，被告申自天，于一九四五年秋，首与驻津美军情报人员发生关系。后被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华等亦于一九四六年一月接受了驻津美联络人员毛德之情报任务。被告佘裕仁，于一九四六年五月，又与蒋匪特务雷鸣庚（又名二雷）发生关系；将所得情报，通过二雷转交蒋匪。被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华、李诗堂，于一九四五年十二月与一九四六年一月间起，密设收发报机一部，由李诗堂负责装置使用；以“ＭＳ”呼号，四○及八○米的波长，与天津“ＧＤ”呼号之电台，进行联络。所有情报，即由常驻平津之被告廖迓迩转给驻平津之美情报人员（有时通过美随军神甫）。自该电台安设后，即不断报告解放区的军事与政治情况。如历次战役前，我部队与担架之动向，人民参军与部队训练情形，以及后方机关之住地与转移方向等，无不及时电告。冀中银行印刷厂，于一九四六年十一月转移住地时，该被告等亦即去电报告。\n    该被告等，除以电台供给情报外，还不断以口头或书面作报告。如被告尚建勋，自一九四六年一月接受情报任务后，曾于当年二月，数度向毛德面作报告。并将他认为最明了解放区及中国共产党情形之佘裕仁，推荐给毛德。于是该被告佘裕仁，每隔两三月，即以买药为名，赴津面作报告。至一九四六年六月，尚建勋因事赴欧，关于情报工作由潘汝霖负责。经潘汝霖与廖迓迩商议，加强情报工作后，规定每半月送津情报一次。该被告等，除口头情报外，尚建勋、佘裕仁、申自天、杜安德、潘汝霖等，更为有书面情报。以上情报，颇受蒋美之重视。尤以申自天所写的关于解放军驻地，数目及装备之情报，曾得二十元美金之奖励。佘裕仁写给蒋匪之情报，亦得雷鸣庚回信之赞扬。被告潘汝霖所写长三十余页之情报更为详尽，曾自称为“解放区百科全书”。此外被告吴怀赤，曾写关于解放区党政军以及经济各方面之稿件一份，极尽诋毁诬蔑之能事。该材料自一九四六年冬写起，经佘裕仁、贾书善、潘汝霖之帮助，于次年春季，始行完成。除一部被我卡获外，其余部分，由佘裕仁带往天津。\n    （二）勾结蒋匪军窜扰解放区，并煽惑战士及青年逃亡：被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、穆启华、廖迓迩，于一九四六年一月四日开会，决定由廖迓迩赴平，以献县教区主教赵振声名义邀请蒋匪军第十一战区司令长官孙连仲进攻解放区，冀其窜踞献县，被告等予以内应。孙匪复称：“已酌派部队前往径剿矣”。又被告贾书善，曾对八个新战士说：“你们有相当机会要逃跑”。又给两个被他鼓动逃跑的战士开给到天津支钱的兑条，并劝他们在那边参加工作。又给一个新战士开介绍信，以便开小差后，到天津有人照顾。总计被告等，前后直接间接煽惑战士及青年逃亡者，共计八十余人。\n    被告等危害解放区之罪行，经献县公安局于一九四七年十月察觉后，当将尚建勋等逮捕到案，送由本局进行侦查。\n    证据：\n    被告尚建勋、潘汝霖、李诗堂、穆启华、贾书善，关于上述等情，不惟供认不讳；且经查获有：潘汝霖致佘裕仁自认其情报必为美国人赞许之信，佘裕仁致二雷请求作空中宣传信，二雷复佘裕仁收到其情报之信，梅怀义通知李诗堂建立与平津电台联络之信，并附波长呼号时间表，及孙连仲相智字第三二二号代电等多件。又吴怀赤诋毁诬蔑解放区之稿件后半部一本均附卷。此外并获有哈特来氏发报机及短波收报机各一部，美制无线电零件多种，电池七块。足证上开事实确属实在。\n    总核被告等之所为，实不仅违犯我民主政府之法令，亦为任何国家法令所不许，应即提起公诉，请依法审判。另：在押被告尚建勋等五人，在侦讯中，供述尚属坦白，并予说明。\n    　此致\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　冀中行政公署公安局副局长兼检察官陆治国\n    　晋察冀边区高等法院冀中分院\n    　　　　　　　　　　中华民国三十七年六月二十九日"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 25th: Reports from various sources: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement on the 20th, announcing that CPUSA Chairman Foster, General Secretary Dennis, and several other party leaders and prominent members have been arrested. These include Williamson, National Labor Secretary of the CPUSA; Winston, Organizational Secretary; Stachel, Propaganda and Education Secretary; Davis, New York City Councilor; and Winter, Chairman of the Michigan State Committee. On the 21st, the above seven leaders were released on bail of $5,000 each, pending trial, after the Human Rights Congress paid their bonds. It is reported that in this grand conspiracy, the Truman government ordered the arrest of as many as twelve members of the CPUSA Central Committee on charges of so-called \"sedition.\" In addition to the above seven, Gates, editor of the Worker’s Daily, was arrested on the 21st, and four others are to be arrested as well. This barbaric persecution by the US government has provoked fierce protests from the CPUSA Central Committee and progressive individuals. CPUSA Chairman Foster, after being released on bail on the 21st, told reporters: \"This conspiracy is an attack on the Communist Party, trade unions, the New Party, and every democratic procedure in the United States. The government's action is intended to force the United States into fascism and war.\" CPUSA General Secretary Dennis denounced the action as \"an arrogant and desperate attempt by the government to win the election. Every progressive American will see, in this conspiracy, which is similar to the Nazi Reichstag fire, an attack on the American Bill of Rights, and that trade unions, the New Party, and black people are in danger.\" Davis, another CPUSA leader, said: \"My arrest proves that Truman's claims about civil rights are pure deception. Since Truman began touting his civil rights program, I and other black people have lost our freedom in the United States.\"\n　　Wallace's National Campaign Committee Director Baldwin, also at a press conference on the 22nd, denounced the arrests as an attack on democratic rights, believing that it was a clear attempt to outlaw the Communist Party. Baldwin continued, \"It is noteworthy that the government's action is occurring in the same week as the New Party is holding its national convention.\" Baldwin pointed out that the suppression of the Communist Party by any country is always accompanied by attacks on other parties, especially the labor movement and civil liberties. Baldwin called on the American people to be vigilant against threats to their democratic rights.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美政府妄图镇压民主控制选举　阴谋迫害美共领袖　美共中央及进步人士猛烈抗议\n\n1948-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美政府妄图镇压民主控制选举\n  　阴谋迫害美共领袖\n  　美共中央及进步人士猛烈抗议\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：美国共产党中央委员会于二十日发表声明，宣布美共主席福斯特、总书记但尼斯及若干其他党的领袖与著名党员已被逮捕，其中包括美共全国职工运动书记威廉逊、组织书记温斯顿、宣传教育书记史塔彻、纽约市议会议员戴维斯、密执安州委主席温特尔。二十一日，上述七位领袖，在人权保障大会为每人付出五千美元保证金后，已恢复开审前的自由。据悉，杜鲁门政府在这次大阴谋中，以所谓“谋叛”罪而下令拘捕的美共中委，共达十二人之多。除上述七人外，工人日报总编盖兹已于二十一日被捕，另有四人亦将被捕。美国政府的这种野蛮迫害行为，已引起美共中央及进步人士的猛烈抗议。美共主席福斯特于二十一日在保释后招待记者称：“这次阴谋乃是对共产党、职工会、新党和美国每一民主程序的进攻。政府采取这一行动，是要迫使美国进入法西斯主义与战争”。美共总书记但尼斯斥责这一行动是“政府想赢得选举的狂妄与绝望的行为。每一个进步的美国人，均将从这次和纳粹国会纵火案一样的阴谋中，看到美国的权利法案受到进攻，看到职工会、新党和黑人处在危险之中。”美共另一领袖戴维斯称：“我的被捕，证明杜鲁门关于公民权利的主张纯是欺人之谈。自从杜鲁门开始高谈他的公民权利纲领以来，我和其他的黑人就在美国失去了自由。”\n    华莱士竞选全国委员会主任鲍尔温，二十二日亦在招待记者会上斥责这次逮捕是对民主权利的进攻，认为这显系企图将共产党置于非法地位。鲍尔温继称：“值得注意的，是政府这一行动正与新党之召开全国代表大会发生于同一星期。”鲍氏指出任何国家对共产党的镇压，总是伴以对其他党派，尤其是对劳工运动与公民自由的进攻。鲍尔温号召美国人民警惕对他们民主权利的威胁。"

However, on the 19th, the parliament finally passed the Socialist Party's amendment (i.e., a reduction of 12 billion francs) by 297 votes to 214. The 297 votes in favor of the amendment included 183 from the Communist Party, 101 from the Socialist Party, and 13 from the Democratic Socialist Union. Approximately 100 people abstained, including all members of the Liberal Republican Party, who are active supporters of de Gaulle. After the amendment was passed, Schuman resigned on behalf of the cabinet to President Auriol, which was approved by Auriol.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 舒曼内阁倒台　法共领袖号召建立人民政府\n\n1948-07-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　舒曼内阁倒台\n  　法共领袖号召建立人民政府\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社报导：法共领袖多列士于十六日在三万劳动人民参加的巴黎群众大会上演说，号召在法国建立真正法国人的政府。多列士指出：“我们共产党人将和社会党人、天主教党人、一切劳动人民以及真诚的共和人士携手，沿着这条唯一正确的道路前进，以便尽快地在我国建立真正的法国人的政府——民主团结的政府。在这个政府中，工人阶级及其共产党将起他们应起的作用。”群众大会结束时，一致通过决议，要求终止戴高乐法国人民同盟内战挑拨者武装团体的活动。\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：以人民共和运动党为首的法国舒曼政府已于十九日倒台。舒曼系于其提交议会的军事预算被削减后提出辞职，该预算原定总额为三千亿法郎，社会党则要求削减一百二十亿法郎（合四千万美元）。舒曼政府事前曾强调宣布不能接受任何超过八十五亿法郎（内阁已决定削减者）以外之削减，并于十七日要求对政府投信任票。但十九日议会终以二九七票对二一四票通过社会党的修正案（即削减一百二十亿法郎）。在上项修正案通过后，舒曼即代表内阁向总统阿里奥尔辞职，并已由阿里奥尔批准。在表决上项修正案之二九七票中，包括共产党一八三票，社会党一○一票，民主社会同盟十三票。弃权者约共一百票，包括戴高乐的积极拥护者——自由共和党的全部议员。"

    "content": "(Jizhong Electric) After correcting leftist deviations in Hanjiawa Village, Gaocheng Tenth District, the production enthusiasm of all classes has greatly increased. The village has 230 households with 1,443 people and over 29 hectares of land, which has been basically leveled. At the beginning of the land reform, the poor peasant team was impure, and they mobilized the masses to struggle against 38 middle peasant families, borrowing more than 20,000 jin of grain. After the district discovered this, although it was stopped, the borrowed grain was not immediately returned. In addition, the assets of five well-to-do middle peasant households wrongly classified as rich peasants were confiscated, causing the middle peasants to panic and lose motivation for production. The middle peasant Liu Luojing secretly buried the waterwheel buckets for fear of being struggled against. When planting in the spring, the middle peasants dared not apply fertilizer. County and district cadres held several meetings in the village, explaining the Party's land reform and production policies, but the peasants remained unmoved until they persuaded the masses to remove the labels from the five wrongly classified well-to-do middle peasants and returned the borrowed grain. The peasants, especially the middle peasants, observe how you \"implement\" the policies; simply \"propagating\" the policies without actual implementation cannot move their hearts. After this, the well-to-do middle peasant Liu Wenzeng, who previously dared not work with peace of mind, applied five pieces of peanut cake fertilizer to each mu of his millet field after the wheat harvest. The poor peasant and military family member Zhang Luoyu applied 105 jin of soybean cake to his four mu of millet. The middle peasants Liu Luocang and Liu Fake are neighbors and have the same soil quality. Fake invested more and harvested seven \"da dou\" of wheat. Luocang invested less and only harvested four \"da dou\". This year, the wheat levy was implemented based on the acreage of wheat fields and the normal yield, so their families contributed the same amount. Luocang regretfully said to Fake, \"The land is the same, you harvested more, and I harvested less, but we both contributed the same. I regret it.\" In order to harvest more grain, he rushed to weave several pieces of cloth to sell and applied two \"dou\" of black beans and five pieces of soybean cake to his three mu of millet land. The village's sideline occupations are also very developed, with 86 weaving machines, mostly operated by men weaving and women spinning. More than 20 households are engaged in milling flour and making noodles. Their sideline occupations and agriculture are combined, ensuring that neither is neglected. In the recent days of drought, the village's waterwheels have been running day and night, with one set of livestock and one set of people, so that idle livestock do not idle the waterwheels. The middle peasant Liu Luojing also dug out the waterwheel buckets he had buried for fear of being struggled against and discussed with the military family member Chen Luozhao about jointly building a waterwheel. After the wheat harvest, the village dug a new well and added four waterwheels. Under the influence of everyone's active production, the lazy people Liu Wanzi and Liu Jigong have also started to work. Two rich peasant households and one landlord household in the village have also started working.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 藁城韩家洼纠正左倾偏向后　水车昼夜不停转地主富农也干活\n\n1948-07-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　藁城韩家洼纠正左倾偏向后\n  　水车昼夜不停转地主富农也干活\n    【冀中电】藁城十区韩家洼纠偏后，各阶层生产情绪大大提高。该村共二百三十户，一千四百四十三口人，地廿九顷多，土地基本上已经填平了。土改开始时，贫农团队伍不纯，曾发动群众斗争了三十八家中农，借出粮食二万多斤。区上发觉后，虽然制止了，但是借的粮食并未立时退回，又加上五户富裕中农被错订成富农查封了家产，因此中农很恐慌，生产没有劲。中农刘洛景因怕斗争，把水车斗子偷着埋了起来。春天种地时，中农们不敢施肥。县区干部到该村连续开了几次会，说明了党的土改与生产政策，但农民仍不动，直至说服群众给五户错订的富裕中农揭了封。退回了借粮。中农们才安了心。农民特别是中农是看你“做”的政策如何，你只“宣传”政策而不实际做是不能打动他的心的，这以后，富裕中农刘文增过去不敢安心做活，麦收后，他每亩谷子拦上了五块花生仁饼。贫农军属张洛玉四亩谷子就拦了一百零五斤豆饼。中农刘洛藏和刘法科是地邻，一样的地质。法科下的本大，收七大斗麦。洛藏下的本小，只收四大斗。今年麦征实行了按麦田亩数及常年应产量的负担办法，他俩家出的一样。洛藏后悔的对法科说：“一样的地，你打的多，我打的少，可是咱俩一样的拿差，我可后悔了。”他为了多打粮食，赶着织出几块布折卖了，在三亩谷地里，施上了二斗黑豆，五块豆饼。该村副业也很发达，八十六张织布机，大部是男织女纺。经营磨面和作挂面的有廿多家。他们的副业和农业都是结合着作，作到两不耽误。前些天天旱，这村的水车昼夜不停。牲口一套人一套，闲牲口不闲水车。中农刘洛景因怕斗埋起来的水车斗子也刨出来，还和军属陈洛昭商量好伙制一辆水车。麦收后，该村打了一眼新井，添了四辆水车。在大家积极生产的影响下，懒汉刘碗子、刘计功也生产起来了。村里两户富农，一户地主，也干起活来。"

In addition to presenting ten solemn demands to the pseudo-Vice President Li Zongren, including \"severely punish Fu Zuoyi\" and \"unconditionally release the students arrested in the July 5th massacre,\" they also demanded the return of the bodies of the killed students. In the afternoon, during the \"Northeast and North China Students Protest the July 5th Massacre Mourning and Accusation Rally\" held by the demonstrating students at Peking University, representatives of the Northeast students tearfully recounted how they were deceived into coming to Peiping, only to be met with machine gun fire, corpses exposed in the streets, tears shed in desolate temples in the wilderness, and even food and lodging problems left unresolved. Amidst grief and indignation, the assembly announced the establishment of the \"Northeast and North China Students Joint Support Association to Protest the July 5th Massacre,\" issued a declaration and a telegram to compatriots nationwide, exposing the truth of the \"July 5th Massacre\" distorted by the Central News Agency, and denouncing the Chiang government's crimes of massacring Northeast students.

    "title": "CCP Central Spokesperson Calls on All Parties for Emergency Assistance in Yellow River Flood Control; Kuomintang Government Troops Will Bear Full Responsibility for All Disaster Consequences If They Do Not Stop Sabotage",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-29",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th) The spokesperson of the CCP Central Committee recently issued an urgent appeal regarding the Yellow River issue, stating:\n\n　　The revetment works on the Yellow River's southern bank in the Dongming to Juancheng section at the junction of Hebei and Shandong provinces are facing the danger of breaching due to the sabotage by Kuomintang troops of the local residents' flood control efforts during the current flood season. If emergency action is not taken to immediately repair them, the risk of breaching is extremely serious. Once a breach occurs, millions of people in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and parts of Hebei provinces south of the lower reaches of the Yellow River will suffer a disaster even more severe than the Yellow River breach in 1938. Since the Yellow River returned to its original course, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government has established a special Yellow River Committee to guide local governments along the river to be responsible for annual dike repairs and flood prevention. Last year, in order to repair the revetment works on the north bank, we mobilized local people to contribute more than 86,000 cubic meters of stone, and despite the shooting and bombing by the Kuomintang army and air force, the project was completed. This year, although the dike repair work on the north bank has been hampered even more severely by the bombing of the Kuomintang army and air force, resulting in many civilian casualties, it was completed in May thanks to the concerted efforts and arduous struggle of the people. However, the situation on the south bank is far more dangerous due to frequent intrusions by Kuomintang troops. In particular, the four major revetment works in Gaocun, Liuzhuang, Zhukou, and Linpuji between Dongming and Juancheng have been repeatedly damaged since February of this year. Wooden stakes were removed to build bunkers, and iron ropes were cut and thrown into the river, causing many dams to experience slippage and water overflow. Large quantities of materials for repairing the revetment works have been burned, looted, and thrown into the river. Most seriously, the civilians repairing the revetment works have not only been bombed and strafed by Kuomintang aircraft, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, but have also been directly attacked by Kuomintang troops, causing the project to be frequently interrupted. On June 16th, after our troops recovered Dongming, the Yellow River Committee and the local democratic government mobilized more than 45,000 civilians and more than 8,000 head of livestock to start repairing the major hazard at Gaocun, and within seven days, nine dams were raised to one to one and a half meters above the water surface. However, on the 4th and 6th of this month, the river's flow suddenly changed, and the facing dams of the 13th and 14th dams were washed away. Since the 7th of this month, Kuomintang aircraft have taken advantage of the situation to bomb wildly, and by the 11th, the number of our staff casualties had reached more than 100, causing the work to be interrupted, which is extremely regrettable. Subsequently, the Kuomintang Reorganized 55th Division, the 81st Brigade of the Reorganized 68th Division, and the Reorganized 47th Army, Reorganized 5th Army and other units reoccupied various points along the river from Dongming to Juancheng, making it even more impossible for us to continue the repairs. Therefore, the risk of a breach on the south bank of the Yellow River has reached an extremely critical juncture. The CCP Central Committee deeply feels that this matter concerns the lives and property of millions of people. If the Yellow River breaches and changes its course to the southeast into the sea, not only will the people in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu liberated areas bear the brunt, but the military and civilians in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially the Kuomintang troops on the south bank of the Yellow River, will be hard pressed to escape calamity. Therefore, we make the following urgent appeals to all parties concerned: (1) It is hoped that the Kuomintang troops on the south bank of the Yellow River will immediately stop obstructing the local residents from continuing to repair the river dikes and stop the acts of burning, looting, and sabotage. (2) It is hoped that the Kuomintang Air Force will immediately stop bombing and strafing the dike repair workers. (3) It is hoped that the Kuomintang water conservancy agencies will provide emergency assistance to the dike repair workers in terms of materials and technology. (4) It is hoped that all domestic and foreign relief, charity, and engineering organizations will provide emergency assistance to the dike repair workers in terms of materials and technology. (5) Whether now or in the future, the liberated area government will sincerely cooperate with any party that is sincerely willing to cooperate with the liberated area government in repairing the Yellow River dikes and jointly plan for progress. We believe that, due to the concerns for the lives and property of millions of people, our sincere appeals should be able to expect a good response. If the Kuomintang government and its troops treat the lives of millions of people as child's play and continue to sabotage the last efforts of the local people to seek survival, then the Kuomintang government shall bear full responsibility for all the disastrous consequences of the Yellow River breach.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中央发言人呼吁各方　紧急援助黄河抢险　国民党政府军队如不停止破坏将对一切灾难后果负完全责任\n\n1948-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中央发言人呼吁各方\n  　紧急援助黄河抢险\n  　国民党政府军队如不停止破坏将对一切灾难后果负完全责任\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】中共中央发言人，顷为黄河问题，发表紧急呼吁称：\n    黄河南岸冀鲁两省交界处之东明至鄄城段险工，因当地居民的抢修工作，被国民党军队所破坏，在目前的伏泛中已面临决口的危险。如不采取紧急行动，立即抢修，则决口危险，极为严重。一旦决口，黄河下游以南之山东、河南、安徽、江苏各省及河北省一部的千百万人民，即将遭受较一九三八年黄河决口惨剧更严重的灾难。自黄河归故以后，我晋冀鲁豫边区政府即专设黄河委员会，指导沿岸地方政府负责每年修堤护堤，实行防汛。去年为修复北岸险工，曾动员当地人民献石八万六千余方，不顾国民党陆空军射击轰炸，卒告竣工。今年北岸修堤工作，虽因国民党陆空军轰击更甚，致民工死伤甚多，惟赖上下同心协力，艰苦奋斗，也已于五月间完成。独南岸则因国民党军队经常侵扰，情况远较险恶。尤以东明至鄄城间之高村、刘庄、朱口、临濮集四大险工，自今年二月以来，即迭遭破坏，木桩被拆去筑碉，铁绳被割断投河，致各坝多发生掉蛰漫水险象。人民修险工料，已被大批焚掠投河。其最严重者，则为修险民工，不但遭国民党飞机轰炸扫射，死伤累累，而且时遭国民党军队直接奔袭，致工程经常被迫停顿。上月十六日我军收复东明，黄河委员会及当地民主政府即动员民工四万五千余人，牲口八千余头，首先动工抢修高村大险，并已于七天内将九个坝修出水面一公尺至一公尺半。乃本月四日及六日河势突变，该处十三、十四两坝的镶头坝均被冲走；而本月七日以后，国民党飞机竟乘危狂炸，至十一日我员工伤亡人数已达一百余人，致工作顿告中断，极堪痛惜。其后，国民党整编五十五师，整编六十八师之八十一旅，及整编四十七军、整编五军等部，先后分别重占东明至鄄城沿河各点，我方继续抢修，更为势所难能。因此黄河南岸决口危险，已至异常严重关头。中共中央深感此事关系千百万人民生命财产；如果黄水奔决，改道向东南入海，则不独我冀鲁豫皖苏解放区人民首当其冲，即国民党统治区军民，首先是黄河南岸的国民党军队，亦绝难幸免。为此，特向有关各方作如下紧急呼吁：（一）希望黄河南岸国民党军队立即停止阻挠当地居民继续抢修河堤险工，并停止焚掠破坏行为。（二）希望国民党空军立即停止对修堤民工的轰炸扫射。（三）希望国民党水利机关在物质上、技术上对修堤民工予以紧急援助。（四）希望中外一切救济、慈善和工程团体在物质上、技术上对修堤民工予以紧急援助。（五）不论在目前或今后，凡任何方面诚意与解放区政府合作修复黄河堤岸者，解放区政府当必推诚合作，共策进行。我们相信：由于千百万人民生命财产所关，我们这些恳切的呼吁，应当可以期待良好的反应。如果国民党政府及其军队视千百万人命为儿戏，仍旧破坏当地人民的救死求生的最后努力，则黄河决口的一切灾难后果，应由国民党政府负其全责。"

Under the general principle of resolutely protecting private industrial and commercial enterprises, and the public sector supporting the private sector, so as to enable the joint development of both, it made clear and specific resolutions.\n\nFirst, the meeting decided that, with the exception of the munitions industry, all industries are permitted to be privately operated or jointly operated by public and private entities. State-owned industries should concentrate on heavy industry, munitions industry, machine manufacturing industry, and the manufacturing of important industrial raw materials. In light industry, the state will only operate businesses that private capital cannot afford and are urgently needed for the people's livelihood. Many existing handicraft workshops and small machine industries within state-owned industries are all prepared to be transferred to cooperatives, institutional production, and private operation. A clear division of labor between the public and private sectors is to be made, so that private industry has a broad space for development. Businessmen from the Kuomintang-controlled areas are welcome to invest in industry and commerce in the liberated areas, and various assistance and conveniences will be provided.\n\nSecond, the meeting pointed out that state-owned commerce should serve the liberation war and people's production, not for profit. The government does not specifically assign financial tasks to state-owned commerce. The task of state-owned commerce is to control and stabilize the prices of major materials related to the people's livelihood, promote the sales of industrial, agricultural, and sideline products, and supply the people with necessary means of production and living. In terms of price policy, state-owned commerce should work with private merchants to stabilize prices and support production. State-owned stores should not exercise control and monopoly, and at the same time, any private commercial hoarding and speculation should be opposed.\n\nThird, the government has granted some privileges to state-owned enterprises, such as the monopoly operation of the munitions industry, the unified procurement of military supplies, the management of the banking industry by the National Bank through the issuance of currency, the management of gold and silver and KMT currency and exchange rates, the monopoly of liquor production, and the unified purchase of saltpeter and sulfur. The meeting unanimously agreed that granting these privileges to state-owned enterprises is reasonable and necessary in terms of the requirements of the war and the economic struggle against the enemy, which in turn is also beneficial to private enterprises. However, apart from these privileges granted by law, state-owned enterprises and institutional production no longer have any other privileges.\n\nFourth, state-owned enterprises should actively provide assistance to private industrial and commercial enterprises. The meeting decided that banks should provide loans to industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and provide support. They should appropriately provide foreign exchange to private industrial and commercial enterprises to purchase necessary raw materials and tools. State-owned stores should establish material adjustment agencies in major cities to help solve the raw material difficulties of private industry, and establish retail departments in major cities to sell parts of the unified procurement of military supplies that are needed by private industry. Public and private transportation businesses should set freight rates that are conducive to the development of industry, agriculture, and commerce.\n\nMany private industrial and commercial representatives were extremely excited about the discussion of the relationship between public and private sectors at this conference. A Shijiazhuang representative who attended the conference said: \"This regulation makes private industrialists and businessmen dare to develop boldly.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 会议明确规定公营私营关系　公营扶助私营  共同发展繁荣\n\n1948-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　会议明确规定公营私营关系\n  　公营扶助私营  共同发展繁荣\n    【本报讯】华北工商业会议对于公营私营工商业间的关系问题，在坚决保护私营工商业，公营扶助私营，以便使公私工商业共同发展的总精神下，进行讨论，作出了明确而具体的决议。\n    第一，会议决定除军火工业外，一切工业均准许私人经营或公私合营。公营工业应集中力量举办重工业、军火工业、机器制造工业、重要工业原料材料制造工业等，在轻工业方面，国家则仅经营私人财力所不及而又为国民生计所迫切需要的事业。公营工业中现有的许多手工业作坊与小的机器工业全部准备转让给合作社、机关生产与私人经营。把公营与私营做出明确分工，以便使私营工业有广阔发展的地盘。欢迎蒋管区工商业家到解放区投资于工商业，并给以各种帮助与便利。\n    第二，会议指出公营商业应为解放战争与人民生产服务，不以赢利为目的。政府不特别赋予公营商业以财政任务。公营商业的任务在于掌握与稳定与国民生计有关的主要物资的价格，推销工业、农业与副业生产品，供给人民必需的生产资料与生活资料。在物价政策上，公营商业应与私商共同来稳定物价与扶助生产。公营商店不应统制垄断，同时也要反对任何私人商业囤积居奇，投机操纵。\n    第三，政府曾给予公营企业以一些特权，如军火工业的垄断经营，军用品的统一采购，国家银行发行货币管理银钱业，管理金银与蒋币蒋汇，酒专烧，硝磺统购等。会议一致认为这些特权授予公营企业，就战争与对敌经济斗争的要求来说，是合理的，必要的，这反回来对私营企业也是有利的。但除了法律授与的这些特权以外，公营企业与机关生产不再有其他任何特权。\n    第四，公营企业应对私营工商业积极的给以帮助。会议决定银行应对有利于国计民生的工商业举办贷款，加以扶助，应适当的供给外汇给私营工商业以购买必须的原料与工具，公营商店在各主要城镇设立物资调剂机构以协助解决私营工业的原料困难，在主要城镇设立门市部出售统一采购的军用品中为私营工业所需要的部分，公私交通事业规定运价应有利于工农商业之发展等。\n    此次大会讨论公私关系问题，许多私营工商业代表极为兴奋。参加大会的一位石家庄代表说：“这样规定，使私人工商业者敢于大胆发展”。"

    "content": "Overcoming Serious Waste and Disorganization\n    Improving the Operation and Management of Public Enterprises\n  　Comrade Bo Yibo Calls for Correcting All Production-Detrimental Tendencies\n    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China Industry and Commerce Conference appropriately assessed the significant achievements of public factories in the North China region in supporting military and civilian needs, but also sharply criticized the serious phenomenon of poor operation and management in current public enterprises, believing that improving operation and management is the most urgent problem to be solved for public enterprises to further improve production.\n    The conference pointed out that the first serious shortcoming in current operation and management is serious waste and a state of anarchy and indiscipline. For example, the Taihang Industrial Company decided to mine coal in a certain area without any detailed survey by engineers and without knowing whether there was a coal seam in the area or how thick the coal seam was. It did not seek approval from the border region government in advance, and it blindly started work without considering its own technical conditions. It was not until a large amount of manpower and materials were consumed and two hundred million yuan were wasted that it was discovered that the coal seam in the area was very shallow and mining could not be successful at all. The Beiyue Administrative Office formulated a huge ×× coal mine mining plan without engineer surveys and signatures and without approval from higher authorities. It has already invested 320 million yuan and is requesting continued investment of 1.8 billion yuan. According to expert research, this mine will not have much of a future due to the shallow coal seam. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Industry Department did not realistically solicit the opinions of engineers and did not pay attention to geological conditions, and rashly proceeded to build air-raid shelters, resulting in many collapses and a waste of 400 to 500 million yuan. Phenomena like this were very common in public enterprises in the past. The conference pointed out that this kind of irresponsible bureaucracy and anarchy and indiscipline must be resolutely corrected in the future, and strict disciplinary sanctions must be enforced if it happens again. It also proposed that in the future, the establishment of factories, the relocation of factories, and the implementation of projects must be subject to detailed investigation, research, and design, and must be implemented only after being signed by certain technicians and engineers and approved by higher authorities. A request has been made to the North China government to formulate regulations and discipline for this.\n    The second serious shortcoming in operation and management is the serious phenomenon of destruction in many factories taken over by public enterprises. For example, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Industry Department destroyed seven air compressors in order to use cylinders; many factories destroyed entire complete machines in order to use the parts of the machines; some factories, when handing over machines to other factories, retained some machine parts that were useful to them, causing all the machines to be damaged; some departments, after taking over factories, did not start work on the spot, but dismantled the machines and moved them away separately. The conference severely criticized this behavior of destroying industry and destroying production, and stipulated that all factories and mines in newly liberated cities must be strictly prohibited from being transferred or destroyed, and must be preserved in their original state and started on the spot. Even if the city is to be withdrawn by our army shortly after its occupation due to strategic reasons, no destruction is allowed at all, because these factories are the wealth of the people and will soon return to the people. The conference decided to properly protect all private factories and mines and help them start production. In the future, except for those that are absolutely necessary for military purposes, no other destruction will be allowed.\n    The third serious shortcoming in operation and management is the \"bureaucratization\" and \"militarization\" of factories in terms of organization and style. There are too many non-production personnel in factories, the establishment is too large, no attention is paid to cost accounting, no importance is attached to profits and losses, and the standard for using cadres is not technical and work ability, but \"qualifications\" and so-called \"political conditions\"; or it does not proceed from enterprise production, but from the point of view of relief. The conference stipulated that all factories must be industrialized in the future, must implement a strict economic accounting system, strengthen production organization, dismiss all unnecessary non-production personnel, and abolish the system of orderlies and special agents brought from the army and organs. In the future, the employment of personnel and administration must be based on technology as the standard, and everything must proceed from technology. Except for special agents and saboteurs, all technical personnel must be given a free hand. The conference pointed out that politics in the factory is to develop production, and there is no abstract politics other than production. Many cadres in the factory who do not understand technology must work hard to learn technology, otherwise he cannot continue to do a good job in the factory, and finally he will have to leave the factory and let others who have technology and can do a good job in production replace him.\n    The conference passed a draft of economic discipline for public factories and sent it to the two border region governments for approval and implementation. The draft stipulates that a resolute struggle must be launched ideologically and organizationally against the current state of indiscipline and disorganization in production, operation, and management of public factories, and the serious waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources caused by departmentalism, liberalism, and bureaucracy. The strengths must be promoted, and the shortcomings must be corrected, and our public enterprises must be pushed forward with a high degree of loyalty to the country and the people. In the draft of economic discipline, specific measures are stipulated to establish a commendation system, a performance appraisal system, and incentives to reward inventions, technological improvements, and all individuals and units that improve production; specific methods are stipulated to resolutely eliminate all wasteful phenomena, practice strict economy, and hold accountable and punish those who manage improperly, neglect their duties, privately transfer property, or dismantle and sell machines without approval. The draft discipline stipulates the establishment of a strong, unified, and centralized leadership concept, and opposes localism and liberalism. In the future, all production plans, production tasks, and financial revenue tasks of all public factories shall be uniformly stipulated and executed by the highest-level government, and no factory leading organ shall be allowed to change them without authorization.\n    In the conclusion of the conference, Comrade Bo Yibo emphasized this issue: The biggest shortcoming of our public enterprises now is that they do not know how to operate and manage, so in order to build industry, we must learn how to manage enterprises. This is a task for the Party and all those engaged in public enterprise work. He also proposed: Who should we learn from? It is obviously wrong to learn from our own tradition of managing factories, because the small factories we established in the long-term decentralized rural guerrilla warfare environment, like our army, adopted the supply system. All the operation and management methods of the factories followed the tradition of the supply system. This system played a positive role in the past and was completely correct, but it is no longer feasible to use this system to manage factories now. It has already produced great harm, \"whether you work or not, it's the same pay.\" It can no longer develop productive forces. The old technicians and expert engineers, however, oppose our supply system and are unwilling to work in our factories. Therefore, we must change the \"tradition of the supply system\" and replace it with operation and management methods that can develop production. Since we have no such legacy to inherit and it is impossible to go to distant overseas countries to learn, we have no choice but to learn from the existing Chinese bourgeoisie. They have decades of technology and experience in managing factories. We must learn all the scientific and rational parts of their production management, economic accounting, and labor organization, and only modify some of the excessively outdated parts that suppress workers and are harmful to production development. Comrade Bo Yibo finally called on all comrades engaged in public industry to fight against all tendencies unfavorable to production. The first is to oppose agricultural socialism in industry, such as egalitarianism in wage policies, decentralization that adapts to local backwardness, and the \"poor peasant perspective,\" \"relief perspective,\" and \"humanitarianism\" in the employment of personnel and administration that do not proceed from the point of view of production and revolution. All abstract \"political conditions\" and \"seniority\" in factories that do not focus on developing productive forces and deviate from developing productive forces should be quickly corrected, and technology and scientific operation and management should be learned.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服严重浪费和无组织状态  改善公营企业经营管理　薄一波同志号召纠正一切不利生产偏向\n\n1948-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　克服严重浪费和无组织状态\n    改善公营企业经营管理\n  　薄一波同志号召纠正一切不利生产偏向\n    【本报讯】华北工商业会议适当的估计了华北区公营工厂支持军需民用之重大成绩，但也尖锐地批评了目前公营企业经营管理不善的严重现象，认为改善经营管理，是目前公营企业进一步提高生产最迫切需要解决的问题。\n    会议指出目前经营管理中第一个严重的缺点是严重的浪费和无政府无纪律状态。如太行实业公司决定在某地开采煤矿，根本没有经过工程师的详细勘察，并不知道该地有无煤层，煤层多厚，事前亦未经过边区政府批准，又不根据自己的技术条件，就盲目地动起工来，直至消耗了大量的人力物力，浪费了两亿元之后，才发觉该地煤层很浅，开采根本不能成功。北岳行署未经工程师勘察和签字未经上级批准就制定了庞大的××煤矿开采计划，现已投资三亿二千万元，还要求继续投资十八亿元。根据专家研究，此矿亦因煤层很浅，不会有多大前途。晋冀鲁豫军工部不切实征询工程师的意见，不注意地质条件，即冒然进行打防空洞，结果坍了很多，浪费至四五亿元之巨。象这类现象，过去在公营企业中是很普遍的。大会指出这种对人民不负责任的官僚主义和无政府无纪律的现象，今后必须坚决纠正，如果再犯，必须严格执行纪律制裁。并提出今后设厂移厂举办工程必须经过详细调查研究设计，经过一定的技师工程师签字和上级核准，始准实行。对此已请求华北政府制定规程和纪律。\n    经营管理的第二个严重的缺点就是在由公营企业所接收的许多工厂中，存在着严重的破坏现象。如晋冀鲁豫军工部为了使用汽缸，破坏了七个空气压缩机；许多工厂为了使用机器的零件而破坏了整个完整的机器，有些工厂在交出机器给其他工厂时，保留下一部分对他们自己有用的机器零件而使全部机器损毁；有的部门在接收工厂后，不去就地开工，而把机器拆卸分散搬走。会议严厉的指摘了这种破坏工业、破坏生产的行为，规定以后新解放城市的一切工矿，一律严禁转移，严禁破坏，必须保存原状，就地开工。即使由于战略关系，我军在占领后不久又要退出的城市也不许丝毫破坏，因为这些工厂都是人民的财富，不久又将重归人民所有。会议决定对于一切私人工矿都要妥为保护，帮助开工生产。今后除了军事上十分必要者外，其他任何破坏，都不允许。\n    经营管理第三个严重的缺点就是工厂在组织上，作风上的“机关化”，“军队化”。工厂中非生产人员太多，编制太庞大，不注意成本计算，不重视盈亏，使用干部不以技术及工作能力为标准，而以“资格”、及所谓“政治条件”为标准；或者不从企业生产出发，而是从救济观点出发。会议规定今后一切工厂必须企业化，必须实行严格的经济核算制度，加强生产组织，解雇一切无必要的非生产人员，取消由军队中机关上带来的勤务员、特务员等制度，今后用人行政，一定要以技术为标准，一切从技术出发，除了特务分子破坏分子以外，一切有技术的人员都要放手使用。大会指出在工厂中的政治就是发展生产，除了生产以外，没有什么抽象的政治。现在工厂中许多不懂技术的干部，都必须努力学习技术，否则他就不能在工厂中继续做好工作，最后只好让他离开工厂，让别的有技术的能做好生产工作的人来代替他。\n    会议通过了公营工厂经济纪律草案送请两个边区政府核准实施。草案规定对目前公营工厂在生产、经营、管理上的无纪律无组织状态，及由于本位主义、自由主义、官僚主义所造成的严重的人力、物力、财力的浪费，必须从思想上、组织上展开坚决的斗争，发扬长处，改正缺点，以高度的对国家对人民的忠诚，把我们的公营企业推向前进。在经济纪律草案中，具体规定了建立褒奖制度，考功考勤制度，奖励创造发明，奖励提高技术，提高生产的一切个人与单位；规定了坚决消灭一切浪费现象的具体办法，厉行节约，凡管理不当，玩忽职守，私相授受，不经批准自行拆毁变卖机器者，一律追究责任，加以惩处。纪律草案规定树立强有力的统一集中的领导观念，反对地方主义与自由主义。今后所有公营工厂之一切生产计划、生产任务及财政收益任务，均由最高级政府统一规定执行，任何工厂领导机关不得擅自更改。\n    在大会结论中，薄一波同志曾就此问题强调指出：现在我们公营企业的最大缺点，就是不会经营，不会管理，因此为了建设工业，就必须学习如何管理企业，这是党和所有从事公营企业工作者的一个任务。他又提出：我们应该向谁学习呢？向我们自己管理工厂的传统学习吧，显而易见是不对的，因为我们在长期的分散的农村游击战争环境下所建立的小型工厂，都如同我们的军队一样是采取的供给制度，工厂的一切经营管理方法，都是随着供给制度的传统而来，这个制度在过去曾经起过积极作用，曾经是完全正确的，但现在再用这个制度来管理工厂就不行了，它已经产生很大弊害，“干不干二斤半”，它已经不能发展生产力了。而旧的技术工人和专家工程师，却都反对我们的供给制而不愿在我们工厂中工作。因此，必须改变“供给制传统”，代之以能够发展生产的经营管理方法。我们既没有此种遗产可以继承，又不可能到遥远的海外去学习，这就使我们不得不向现有的中国的资产阶级学习，他们已经有了几十年管理工厂的技术与经验，我们要学习他们在生产管理、经济核算、劳动组织上的一切科学的合理的部分，而仅仅修改一些过份陈旧的、压制工人的、对生产发展有害的部分。薄一波同志最后号召全体从事公营工业的同志们要与一切不利于生产的偏向作斗争，首先就是反对工业中的农业社会主义，如工资政策中的平均主义，适应地方落后性把机器分散的分散主义，用人行政不从生产观点、革命观点出发的“贫雇观点”“救济观点”“人道主义”，以及在工厂中一切不讲求发展生产力离开发展生产力的抽象的“政治条件”“老资格”等，均应迅速的加以纠正学习技术，学会科学的经营管理。"

A system of mutual assistance and freight forwarding has been established between the military transport system and the government's finance department and the industrial and commercial bureau's transportation department, reducing the waste of transport capacity caused by empty return trips and improving transport efficiency. Strengthening education on mass discipline for transport personnel, with unified management and command by local military stations upon arrival at any location, has greatly reduced violations of mass discipline. Visiting wounded soldiers, sick personnel, cadres, and military personnel are also uniformly received and transferred by the military station, overcoming the past phenomenon of visiting personnel arbitrarily mobilizing the labor of the masses, animal power, and food. Between Xing County and Lin County, a distance of 160 li, this has saved the manpower of six reception stations for the masses, as well as the monthly consumption of wages, oil, salt, firewood, and rice. The military station also constantly checks the stretchers and livestock needed by visiting personnel. Under conditions that do not hinder health, those sitting on stretchers are persuaded to ride livestock, and those riding livestock are persuaded to walk.

    "content": "[Jilu Yu Electric] Reporter Jun Qian's comprehensive report on the Yellow River levee restoration and flood relief project and the crimes of sabotage committed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the management of the Yellow River stated: This year's Yellow River levee restoration and flood relief project could have been fully completed according to plan with the concerted efforts of the Party, government, army, and people of Jilu Yu, but due to the crazy sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, some parts can only be completed by 70% to 90%. Especially during this flood season, after Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied various dangerous sections along the 300-mile stretch from Gaocun in Dongming to ＠shan on the 17th of this month, they are carrying out large-scale sabotage, putting millions of people on the south bank of the Yellow River in danger. The reporter recounted the Yellow River Committee's levee restoration situation this year, stating: The Linhuang levee stretches over 620 li from Dacheji in Changyuan County to Shuiniu Zhao dangerous section in Qiyu County. According to the levee's height, width, and last year's highest water level, this year it is necessary to raise it to 2.5 meters above last year's highest water level and 1.2 meters above the highest water level in 1925, with the levee top widened to 7 to 9 meters. Except for a section near Dawangzhuang in Fan County and a section from Qiyu Shuiniu Zhao to Suozhuang that will be completed after the wheat harvest, all the remaining sections that need to be repaired were completed before the wheat harvest, and the northern section of the Guanmeng levee in Quhe County was also completed. It was planned to complete the southern section of the Guanmeng levee after the wheat harvest. If this section is completed, it can be ensured this year without any worries if there is no sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek's troops and the puppet Wang San's division suddenly occupied Changyuan City on the 17th of this month and carried out large-scale sabotage. The southern section of our Guanmeng levee project was forced to stop, posing a great threat to the consolidated levee defense hundreds of miles below Changyuan. The focus of this year's Yellow River management project is to make the height and width of the renovated dangerous sections the same as those on the north bank. The levee restoration projects in Juancheng, Yun (cheng) North, and ＠shan counties focused on the Shou (zhang) South section of Yun (cheng) North County. The levee restoration projects in these three counties had already started before the wheat harvest but were stopped due to the harassment and sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. After the wheat harvest, with the protection of the People's Liberation Army, more than 27,000 laborers were mobilized and completed the levee restoration plan from June 14th to July 3rd. However, due to the threat of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, a section of nearly 40 li from Mazhuang to Chenhai only increased the height during this levee restoration but failed to widen it, with a top width of only 5 meters, which was not solid enough. Therefore, 12,000 laborers were mobilized again on July 13th to start the project of thickening it by 2 meters. However, Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who were sabotaging the river management, invaded Juancheng on the 15th, Danbei and ＠shan on the 16th, causing this levee restoration project to be forced to stop after only one-third of it was completed. Regarding the dangerous sections and the current situation of Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage, the reporter reported that the Shou Zhang Sunkou dangerous section on the north bank often had accidents under the sabotage of Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the opposite bank last year, with two breaches. Now, due to changes in the river's course, it is stable and safe. The north bank has the most dangerous sections in the four county sections of Xuyi, Dongjia, Hexi, and Qiyu under the Fourth Repair and Defense Office, from Niutun in the Xuyi section to Shuiniu Zhao in Qiyu, all the way to Qihe City, there are 53 large and small dangerous sections including Yuanzhuang, Suozhuang, Wulipu, Guzhuang, and Nanfang. Last year, the above counties completed the great project of more than 86,000 cubic meters of stone, and this year they completed the stone transportation project of more than 23,000 cubic meters of stone in Xuyi section, Dong'e section, Hexi section, and Qiyu section. This stone, except for some used for repairing dangerous sections, is mostly stored in levee construction. The stone materials prepared for the flood season are extremely alarming. What is very alarming is the Guantai dangerous section in Quhe County. After Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops breached the levee near this dangerous section last year, although it was blocked under the cover of our army, it has not been repaired to this day due to the occupation of the bandit puppet troops. Especially after being occupied by the bandit puppet troops on the 17th of this month, the dangerous section is even more worrying. As for the dangerous sections on the south bank, although they are not as many as those on the north bank, most of them are the largest and most dangerous projects, such as Gaocun in Dongming County, Zhukou and Liuzhuang in Nanhua County (northwest of Heze), Linpu in Juancheng County, and the four major dangerous sections of 7,820 meters long from Lujia to Shilipu in ＠shan County. The next are Zhong＠dui in the Yunbei section, Yangji and Wangzhuang in the Shounan section. Due to changes in the river's course, after our half-year flood relief work last year, these two dangerous sections were fortunately able to survive the flood season last year. However, recently, Yangji has shown a tightening situation again, and S阁 upstream of Zhong＠dui and Wanglaojun in the Shounan section have shown signs of danger.\n\nAs for the Gaocun dangerous section, after the liberation of Dongming City in mid-June, our Yellow River Committee immediately led the First Defense Office to carry out emergency repairs, transporting 600 cubic meters of stone, 500,000 catties of willow branches, and more than 60,000 bricks, working day and night. By July 3rd, all dams above the 12th dam had been repaired. On the 4th, the river's course suddenly changed, and the main current rushed straight, washing away the head dam of the 14th dam and continuing to expand the dangerous situation. By the 6th, the head dam of the 13th dam was also washed away. All our river management staff and local people implemented emergency repairs, working day and night. Under the heavy bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft, the repairs were completed by the 9th, and the 13th dam was turned from danger to safety. From the 10th to the 11th, the upstream dam of the 14th dam was washed away by 9 meters. If this dam was lost, the main current could rush fiercely into the levee, causing the levee to breach. In this emergency situation, the 68th Division and 241st Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's army invaded the dangerous section on the 17th, and our emergency repair project was forced to stop. The Liuzhuang dangerous section began to be repaired on June 18th, transporting 600,000 bricks and more than 400,000 catties of willow branches. It was also forced to stop due to Chiang Kai-shek's troops' northward invasion this time. The Linpu dangerous section originally had more than 1,100 cubic meters of stone, and more than 900 cubic meters were transported, as well as more than 400,000 catties of straw and stone materials. In addition to those already used, more than 1,000 cubic meters are still stored for flood prevention. However, the Chiang Kai-shek's troops who invaded northward this time burned more than 1 million catties of straw, doing everything possible to destroy it. Finally, the reporter stated: Under such crazy sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek, not only does the possibility of a breach on the south bank seriously exist, but also Quhe and Changyuan on the north bank are facing the danger of the Yellow River disaster due to the occupation and sabotage by the bandit puppet troops.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 千百万人民在抢险中——记我治黄工程及蒋匪乘危破坏罪行\n君谦\n1948-07-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　千百万人民在抢险中\n    ——记我治黄工程及蒋匪乘危破坏罪行\n    【冀鲁豫电】记者君谦综合报导黄河复堤抢险工程及蒋匪军破坏治黄罪行称：黄河今年的复堤和抢险工程，在冀鲁豫党政军民一致努力下，本可全部按计划完成，但由于蒋匪的疯狂破坏，有的只能完成百分之七十到九十，特别是当此大汛期间，蒋匪军本月十七日侵占东明高村至＠山三百里长的各处险工后，正大肆破坏，使黄河南岸数百万人民，已面临危境。记者历述我黄委会今年复堤情形称：临黄堤从长垣县的大车集至齐禹县的水牛赵险工，全长六百二十余华里。根据堤的高、宽程度和去年最高水位的情形，今年要加高到高出去年的最高水位二公尺半，高出民国十四年的最高水位一点二公尺，堤顶加宽七公尺至九公尺。除了范县大王庄附近一段及齐禹水牛赵至索庄一段延至麦后完成外，共余需要加修的，全部在麦前竣工，并完成了曲河县贯孟堤的北段工程。在麦后计划再完成贯孟堤南段，如该段完成，无蒋匪破坏，今年便可确保无虞。不料蒋匪军与伪王三视部，于本月十七日突然侵占长垣城，大肆破坏。我贯孟堤南段工程，被迫停工。给我长垣以下数百里巩固堤防以极大威胁。今年治黄工程的重点是整险堤的高、宽度要求与北岸同。而鄄城、郓（城）北、＠山三县的复堤工程，是以郓（城）北县的寿（张）南段为重点，这三县的复堤工程，在麦前本已动工，后因蒋匪军的窜扰破坏而停工。麦后在人民解放军掩护下，动员了二万七千余名民工，于六月十四日至七月三日完成了复堤计划。但由于蒋匪军的威胁，从马庄至陈海近四十里的一段，此次复堤只加了高度，未能加宽，顶宽只五公尺，尚不够巩固，遂又动员了一万二千民工于七月十三日开始了培厚二公尺的工程，而破坏治河的蒋匪军，竟又于十五日侵占了鄄城，十六日侵占了郸北和＠山等地，致使此次复堤工程，只完成三分之一就被迫停工了。关于各地险工及现状蒋匪破坏情形，记者报导称：北岸之寿张孙口险工，去年在对岸蒋匪军破坏之下，经常出险，曾两次跑埽，现因河势变化，已平稳无事。北岸以第四修防处的徐翼、东佳、河西、齐禹等四个县段险工最多，从徐翼段的牛屯至齐禹的水牛赵，一直到齐河城一段，尚有袁庄、索庄、五里铺、顾庄、南妨等大小险工共五十三处，去年上述各县完成了八万六千余方石的伟大工程，今年又完成了徐翼段、东阿段、河西段及齐禹段共二万三千余方石的运石工程，此石除整险用了一部外，大部存在堤坝工作。大汛期的备防石料。极可警惕的，是曲河县的贯台险工，去年被蒋匪伪军在该险工附近决口后，虽在我军掩护下堵住，但后来由于匪伪军的盘踞，至今未能进行整修，尤其是本月十七日被匪伪军侵占后，该处险工更可忧虑。至于南岸险工虽不似北岸多但大部为最大最险的工程，如东明县的高村，南华县（菏泽西北）的朱口、刘庄，鄄城县的临濮和＠山县从路家至十里铺七千八百二十公尺长的四大险工。其次为郓北段的仲＠堆，寿南段的杨集、汪庄，由于河势变化，去年经我半年抢险工作，该两险工，去年幸能度过大汛期。但最近杨集又有再度吃紧的形势，仲＠堆上游的苏阁及寿南段的王老君，又有出险趋势。\n    至于高村险工，六月中旬解放东明城后，我黄委会即率领第一条防处进行抢修，抢运石料六百方，柳枝五十万斤，砖六万余块，日夜抢修，至七月三日，十二坝以上各坝都已修好。四日河势突变，大溜直冲，将十四坝里头埽冲跑，并继续扩大险象，至六日，十三坝之里头埽亦被冲跑，我全体治河员工及当地群众，实行紧急抢修，日夜赶工，在蒋匪机大肆轰炸下，抢修至九日，十三坝才得转危为安，十日至十一日，十四坝之上口埽掉蛰九公尺，如此坝失守，大溜即可猛扑大堤，使大堤决口，在此紧急情况下，蒋匪军六十八师、二四一团，于十七日侵入险工，我抢修工程即被迫停工。刘庄险工从六月十八日开始抢修，运到六十万块砖，四十余万斤柳枝，亦因蒋匪军此次北犯而被迫停工。临濮险工原有一千一百余方石，又运来九百余方，并运来四十多万斤秸料、石料，除已用者外，尚存千余方备防石。而北犯的蒋匪军此次侵至险工后，烧毁百余万斤秸料，极尽破坏之能事。最后记者称：在蒋匪如此疯狂破坏下，不但南岸决口的可能性严重存在，即北岸曲河和长垣，于匪伪军的盘踞破坏下，也同样面临着黄灾的危险。"

Although a plane ticket from Jinan to Nanjing costs more than 300 million (蒋币, Jiang currency, hereinafter the same), it is still extremely crowded.

Everyone believes that the current serious situation in Jinan will be the darkness before dawn.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 22nd: Many merchants and civilians in Zhengzhou have fled to the Liberated Areas due to the unbearable exploitation by the Chiang government. According to news from the Henan-West front: Merchants who have just escaped from Zhengzhou say that the Chiang government authorities in the city are deeply fearful of the People's Liberation Army's offensive. Recently, they have been stepping up the construction of fortifications day and night, and demolishing civilian houses on a large scale. The merchant said that he originally had seven houses, all of which have been razed to the ground by the Chiang army. Dozens of fruit trees have also been cut down, and more than 20 acres of garden land have been turned into trenches, making it impossible for the whole family to live. Another example is a photo studio in the west entrance of West Guan Street. Recently, it was assigned more than eight stones of wheat, more than one hundred and sixty sacks, and 4.3 million yuan (蒋币, Jiang currency, hereinafter the same). It also had to send two workers every day to build fortifications, which made the store manager unable to cope and flee Zhengzhou. His old mother and guarantor are still being held in the town office. Now, larger stores are being assigned more than one hundred stones of military wheat at a time. Many stores have to hang up signs saying \"Clearing accounts, suspending business.\" In the west section of Datong Road alone, more than 50 stores have declared bankruptcy, including Hua Da Foreign Goods Store, Fuyuan Foreign Goods Store, Lifeng Tea Store, and Central Tobacco Company. All that remains are some small food stalls. Now prices in the city are soaring.

The order instructed all military regions that in addition to earnestly studying and implementing the Northwest Bureau's instructions, they must also pay attention to the following points: (1) In terms of linking with reality, emphasis should be placed on summarizing the rich experience in combat; reviewing the policy thinking and policy implementation of the cadres in the troops; and focusing on disrespect for the Party's organization, failure to resolutely implement orders, failure to report important situations of the troops to higher levels; acting independently, violating the unified system, concealing seized materials, undermining discipline, alienating the masses, and desertion. Criticism and self-criticism should be carried out in the study, examining the causes and responsibilities, and discussing improvement measures. (2) In terms of method, the experience of the \"Three Check-ups\" movement should be studied and adopted, with the focus on promoting democracy, clearing up thinking, and raising the class consciousness of cadres and soldiers; avoid simple accusations and routine introspection. Do not hold study meetings without preparation. (3) Cadres at the military region level should, as far as possible, organize studies jointly with the main local Party and government cadres, so as to promote democratic criticism under the unified leadership of the Party committee, earnestly examine and improve work, and further consolidate the unity between the local authorities and the troops, and close the relationship between the army and the people.

    "content": "(Jilu Yu News) The Pingyin recovered area has correctly implemented a lenient policy and carried out a political offensive, attracting 1,873 fugitive households to return home, accounting for one-half of the total number of fugitives. The returnees also brought back 119 rifles and 26 pistols.\n    (Taihang Telegraph) Since July, the democratic governments and local armed forces of various counties in northern Henan have launched political offensives against the isolated strongholds of the enemy in Xiuwu, Jiaozuo, and other places. Local bullies and soldiers have surrendered to us one after another, and fleeing masses have returned home in an endless stream. After the political offensive meeting in Xiuwu on June 26, a political offensive blitz week was launched, during which 26 die-hard soldiers were won over to surrender to us within seven days. Under the influence of our military victories and political offensives, the Chiang Kai-shek clique was in chaos and unease, filled with pessimistic and wavering sentiments. Many villages in the Chiang-occupied areas that were forced to organize suicide squads were automatically disbanded under the influence of our political offensives. Fugitive households returned one after another. According to statistics from 13 villages in 4 districts, 116 people returned within 7 days, bringing back 23 head of livestock. The returning fugitive households were given relief and resettlement by the government, and the villagers helped by lending food and distributing land.

    "content": "Restoring and Developing Industrial Production in Liberated Areas\n  　The North China Industrial and Commercial Conference Achieves Great Success\n  　Formulating Specific Measures to Protect and Develop Industry and Commerce\n    [Reported by Our Newspaper] The North China Liberated Area Industrial and Commercial Conference concluded on June 27th. Based on the guiding principles of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, the conference formulated specific measures to implement the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, and reviewed shortcomings in past work. This laid the foundation for the rapid development of industry and commerce in the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji liberated areas under unified policies and specific measures. The resolutions passed by the conference have been submitted to the merged Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Governments for approval and implementation.\n\n    The conference opened in Shijiazhuang on May 17th and lasted for forty-two days. A total of 320 delegates attended, including administrative personnel and staff from government, trade unions, and state-owned enterprises, as well as representatives from cooperatives and private industrial and commercial capitalists and laborers. Among them, there were 36 representatives from private industrial and commercial capitalists and 31 representatives from laborers. The conference was presided over by Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, and Yao Yilin, Deputy Director of the Jin-Cha-Ji Finance Office, appointed by the North China Central Bureau. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Comrade Dong Biwu, Comrade Luo Mai, Comrade Teng Daiyuan, and others all attended the conference to provide guidance. Comrade Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party gave a concluding speech. He believed that such a grand conference dedicated to discussing the restoration and development of industry and commerce was the first of its kind in both border regions, and that the conference achieved great success under the guidance of Chairman Mao's and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's correct policy of protecting industry and commerce. He believed that this conference was the starting point for building industry in the North China Liberated Area.\n\n    The conference discussed the relationship between public and private industry and commerce, labor-capital relations, industrial and commercial burdens, industrial and commercial administrative work, and correcting certain deviations in land reform that infringed upon industry and commerce. The conference also specifically discussed issues such as business management, wage systems, and worker welfare in state-owned enterprises. On these issues, the conference established correct guidelines and specific implementation measures.\n\n    Regarding the relationship between public and private industry and commerce, the conference pointed out that both public and private industries need to be greatly developed. Except for the munitions industry, all industries can be freely operated by private individuals. State-owned industries should systematically supply private industries with machinery, raw materials, and power to help them develop. The conference stipulated that the task of state-owned commerce is to support production, stabilize prices, and ensure that private commerce and cooperatives are profitable through correct pricing policies, while opposing speculation and manipulation. Regarding labor-capital relations, the conference criticized the errors in some areas in the past, which failed to deeply understand the overall guideline of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, and set excessively high labor conditions with a short-sighted and one-sided pursuit of so-called worker welfare. It was determined that in the future, labor and capital should have freedom of contract, recognize the original wage and working hour systems, and the original labor-capital, employer-employee, and master-apprentice relationships. Based on the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, the existing work systems and management methods should be recognized, but some necessary improvements should be made, which are indispensable. Regarding the burden on industry and commerce, the conference pointed out that industrial and commercial taxes must not hinder the development of industry and commerce, and revenue should be generated under this premise to support the war. It was stipulated that the maximum progressive rate of industrial and commercial income tax should not exceed 25% of net profit, and necessary reductions and exemptions should be made for industrial taxes to encourage industrial development. Regarding industrial and commercial administrative work, the conference stipulated that private industry and commerce, except for businesses prohibited by law, should be recognized as legal operations and protected by law as long as they are registered with the government, and no one should infringe upon them except in accordance with the law. The conference also decided to abolish the road pass system within the liberated area, abolish the privileges of exchanges to monopolize transactions, allow private individuals to establish warehouses, protect trademark rights, and simplify import and export trade procedures, in order to ensure free domestic trade and improve foreign trade management.\n\n    Regarding the issue of state-owned enterprises, the conference sharply pointed out that the most serious shortcomings at present are poor management, the traditional supply system, the attitude of \"doing the same amount of work regardless of effort,\" and the use of \"politics,\" \"seniority,\" and \"poor peasant\" status as criteria for personnel administration instead of technology and production development, which has resulted in production remaining at a very low level and unable to move forward. It was emphasized that management should be improved, planning and discipline strengthened, cost accounting and economic responsibility systems implemented, and enterprises should be run like enterprises. The conference severely criticized the state of disorganization and lack of discipline, and stipulated economic discipline for state-owned enterprises. The conference pointed out that the main errors in the current wage system of state-owned enterprises are egalitarianism, vulgar \"mass viewpoints,\" and relief viewpoints. Trainee workers and unskilled workers are treated too highly, and the wage difference between technical workers and trainees and unskilled workers is too small (the highest wage for technical workers is only three to four times the lowest wage). Wage standards are not based on the workers' skills and labor enthusiasm, but \"benevolently\" based on the number of family members they support. The number of employees in each state-owned factory has expanded, but the wages of technical workers have been reduced. The delegates unanimously agreed that this egalitarianism is contrary to the principle of developing production, is a way to reduce production and destroy productivity, is a relief viewpoint, not a production viewpoint, is humanitarianism, not revolutionaryism, and must be resolutely corrected. It was believed that the only criterion for determining wage levels should be the degree of labor skill, that is, the degree of mastery of production technology. There is no other criterion, and wages must be clearly separated from social relief. The conference stipulated that in state-owned enterprises in newly liberated cities, the original base salary and grade of employees should be maintained. In wartime, wages should be paid according to a certain multiple of the base salary based on the cost of living index, and subsidies should be provided in the form of rations to make up for the shortfall. In the original factories in the liberated areas, preparations are also being made to gradually move towards this wage system. The conference adopted a draft wartime wage system for state-owned factories as a temporary transitional wage system for the existing factories in the North China Liberated Area. The conference also passed important resolutions such as implementing a salary system for state-owned factory staff, implementing a ten-hour workday, requiring factories to contribute 1.5% of the total wage bill as a cultural and educational fund for employees, and 2.5% of the total wage bill as an insurance fund for employees.\n\n    Throughout the entire conference, the discussions were filled with the spirit of actively supporting the war and developing production. Representatives from all parties actively expressed their opinions. The representatives of private industrialists and businessmen were particularly active. They further understood the Chinese Communist Party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce at the conference. They raised many opinions and requests to the government and state-owned enterprises, most of which were satisfactorily resolved. The convening of this conference in Shijiazhuang also provided considerable assistance to all the delegates who attended, because they all saw the prosperity of Shijiazhuang with their own eyes, and the increasing development of production and transportation. They recognized the great role of Chairman Mao's correct industrial and commercial policies in building the liberated areas and building a new China, and strengthened their determination and confidence in implementing the resolutions of the Industrial and Commercial Conference.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 恢复与发展解放区工业生产　华北工商会议获巨大成功　订出保护发展工商业的各项具体办法\n\n1948-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　恢复与发展解放区工业生产\n  　华北工商会议获巨大成功\n  　订出保护发展工商业的各项具体办法\n    【本报讯】华北解放区工商业会议已于六月二十七日闭幕。会议根据发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的指导方针，订出了实行中共中央保护与发展工商业政策的各项具体办法，并检查了过去工作中的缺点。使原晋冀鲁豫及原晋察冀两解放区的工商业获得在统一的政策与具体办法下迅速发展的基础。会议所订出的各项决议，已送呈业已合并办公的晋冀鲁豫及晋察冀两边区政府批准执行。\n    会议于五月十七日在石家庄揭幕，前后历时四十二天，出席代表共三百二十人，政府、工会、公营企业的行政人员及职工、合作社和私营工商业资方和劳方都派有代表出席，其中私营工商业资方代表共三十六人，劳方代表共三十一人。会议由华北中央局指派晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰及晋察冀财办副主任姚依林主持，朱总司令、董必武同志、罗迈同志、滕代远同志等皆先后到会指导。会议最后由中共中央华北局薄一波同志作总结。他认为象这样隆重盛大的、专门讨论工商业恢复和发展问题的会议，在两边区都是第一次，会议在毛主席和中共中央正确保护工商业政策昭示下获得极大成功。他认为这次会议乃是建设华北解放区工业的起点。\n    会议讨论了工商业政策中的公营私营工商业关系、劳资关系、工商业负担、工商行政工作及纠正土地改革中某些侵犯工商业的偏向等问题。会议并专门讨论了公营企业中的经营管理、工资制度及工人福利问题。在这些问题上，会议都规定了正确的方针与具体的实施办法。\n    在公营私营工商业关系中，会议指出了公营与私营工业，都需要大大发展，除军火工业外，一切工业私人都可以自由经营，公营工业应当有计划的供给私营工业以机器原料和动力，帮助私营工业发展。会议规定了公营商业的任务，是扶助生产，稳定物价，并通过正确的物价政策，使私人商业、合作社都有利可图，反对投机操纵。在劳资关系中，会议指摘了过去有些地区，未能深刻体会发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的总方针，以近视的片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标，规定过高的劳动条件的错误。确定今后劳资双方契约自由，承认过去原有的工资、工时制度与原有的劳资、东伙与师徒关系，并根据劳资两利原则，承认旧有的工作制度和经营方法，但须加以若干的必要的改进，这是不可缺少的。对于工商业负担，会议指出工商业税必须不妨碍工商业之发展，在此前提下争取收入，支援战争。规定工商业所得税最高累进率不超过纯利的百分之二十五，并为奖励工业发展，对工业税作必要的减免。对于工商行政工作，会议规定除法律禁止之营业外，私人工商业只要向政府登记，即确认为合法经营，受法律之保护，任何人非依法律不得侵犯。会议并决定取消解放区境内路条制度，废除交易所垄断交易的特权，准许私人设立行栈，保护商标专用权，简化出入境贸易手续等具体办法，以保障内地贸易自由，改进对外贸易管理。\n    关于公营企业问题，会议尖锐地指出了目前最严重的缺点是经营管理不善，供给制传统，“干不干二斤半”，用人行政不是以技术和发展生产为标准，而是以“政治”“老资格”“贫雇”等为标准等，以致生产停留在很低水准，不能前进。强调提出改善经营管理，加强计划性，纪律性，成本会计，经济责成制，实行企业化。会议严厉的批评了无组织无纪律状态，规定了公营企业经济纪律。会议指出了公营企业的现行工资制度中主要的错误是平均主义，庸俗的“群众观点”和救济观点。学徒工人与非熟练工人待遇太高，技术工人与学徒及非熟练工人之间工资的差别太小（技术工人最高工资只合最低工资的三倍到四倍），工资标准不是以工人的技术和劳动热忱为标准，而是“仁慈”的以养活其全家几口人为标准，每个公营工厂人数都扩大了，技术工人工资却减低了。到会代表一致认为这种平均主义是与发展生产的原则相违背的，这是降低生产毁灭生产力的办法，是救济观点，不是生产观点，是人道主义，不是革命主义，必须坚决改正。认为应以劳动的熟练程度，亦即掌握生产技术的熟练程度为决定工资等级的唯一标准，除此之外，再没有其他任何标准，必须把工资与社会救济截然分开。会议规定了在新解放城市公营企业中，保持职工原来的底薪，及其原来的等级，在战时，根据生活指数按底薪的一定倍数发给工资，并以配给办法补助其不足。在解放区原有的工厂中，也准备逐渐向这种工资制度看齐。会议通过了公营工厂战时工资制度草案，作为华北解放区原有的工厂目前暂行的过渡的工资制度。会议并通过了公营工厂职员实行薪金制，实行十小时工作制，工厂每月需提出相当于工资总额百分之一·五作为职工文化教育基金，相当于工资总额百分之二·五作为职工保险金等重要决议。\n    在整个会议的讨论中，充满了积极支援战争和发展生产的精神。各方面的代表都积极的发表了自己的意见。其中私人工商业家的代表格外积极，他们在会议中进一步了解了中国共产党保护与发展工商业的政策，他们提出了对于政府和公营企业的许多意见和要求，大部都得到了满意的解决。此次会议在石家庄召开，对到会全体代表也有不小的帮助，因为他们都亲眼看见石家庄的繁荣，和生产与交通的日益发展，认识了毛主席的正确的工商业政策之执行，对于建设解放区，建设新中国的伟大作用，加强了他们执行工商业会议决议的决心与信心。"

    "content": "Carrying out Lenient Policies on Mass Discipline During Suppression\n　　Most of the Local Chiang Kai-shek Forces in Western Henan Eliminated\nXinhua News Agency, Western Henan, 26th – Our base area armed forces in a certain district of Western Henan, during the suppression of local Chiang Kai-shek forces in the Fu-Ban mountainous area, correctly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, resulting in significant achievements in the suppression. Over the past two months, they have annihilated more than 3,000 bandits from the local Chiang Kai-shek forces, including Li Hanwen, Li Hansan, Xiao Chengwei, and Xiao Chengbo of the \"Funiu Mountain Anti-Tyranny General Corps,\" as well as the Kuomintang militia from Luoning, Songxian, Yiyang, and Yiyang counties. Most of the local Chiang Kai-shek forces in the above counties have now been eliminated.\n\n　　Each member of our troops entering the mountains for suppression carried five days' worth of rations on their backs. At the same time, grain transportation stations were set up throughout the mountainous areas, from the eastern foot of the Funiu Mountains to the interior. Ten percent of the grain transported was paid to the masses who helped our army transport grain, ensuring the troops' supply and solving the spring famine difficulties of the mountainous masses. Under any difficult circumstances, the troops resolutely abided by mass discipline. For example, when the troops entered the Checun area, the grain had not arrived, and although the soldiers endured hunger and braved wind and rain to continue fighting, they still did not take anything from the masses, which made the local masses deeply aware of the strict discipline of our army. The masses who had been intimidated and deceived by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and had fled as a result, returned home reassured. Some small groups of local Chiang Kai-shek forces, influenced by our army's lenient policy of \"those who surrender their weapons will not be killed, and their livelihoods will be guaranteed,\" and with the assistance of the local masses, surrendered their weapons and returned home to production. In Checun and Huangcun villages alone, more than 170 people returned.\n　\n    Xinhua News Agency, Western Henan, 22nd – Over the past five months, Yiyang County has persuaded more than 1,000 local Chiang Kai-shek forces to return, and all local Chiang Kai-shek forces in the county have been eliminated, making the county even more peaceful. Last November, when Hu Zongnan's troops invaded Ziya Mountain, Chen Dan, the bandit leader of Yiyang, gathered local bandits and hooligans, and coerced some villagers to join the rebellion, totaling more than 1,300 people. Wherever these bandits went, they committed rape, robbery, arson, and murder, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and the masses hated them to the bone. After three suppressions by the county's local armed forces, which inflicted heavy blows on them, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 70 bandits, the coerced elements began to flee. The democratic government then universally called for them to return home and settle down, and at a memorial meeting for the martyred victims in a certain place, released two coerced elements, Li Huaying and others, who had repented to the masses. As a result, the general bandits came back one after another. Ji Dehe and Li Sicong, the captains of the local Chiang Kai-shek forces, led more than 50 of their men and weapons to surrender to the Xicun Village Government. Before the lunar new year, the democratic government put forward the slogan of handing in guns and returning home to have a good year. At the same time, a unit of our army used a small force to defeat Chen Dan's bandit troops of more than 600 people in one fell swoop, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 180 of them, and Chen Dan was wounded and fled. The scattered bandits repented and surrendered their weapons in large numbers, totaling more than 600 people. After the victory of Luoyang, our democratic government widely launched propaganda work, achieved the goal of isolating the bandit leaders, and won over the remaining local Chiang Kai-shek forces to hand over their hidden weapons and repent. By this time, all the local Chiang Kai-shek forces in the county had been eliminated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 清剿中执行群众纪律宽大政策　豫西土蒋大部肃清\n\n1948-07-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　清剿中执行群众纪律宽大政策\n  　豫西土蒋大部肃清\n    【新华社豫西二十六日电】豫西我某分区基干武装，于清剿伏半山区土蒋中，正确执行三大纪律八项注意，使清剿获得重大成果。两月来共歼土蒋“伏牛山除暴总团”李汉文、李汉三、萧成为、萧澄波等匪，及洛宁、嵩县、伊阳、宜阳等县还乡团三千余人。以上各县土蒋，现已大部肃清。\n    我入山清剿部队，每人均自背五日食粮。同时从伏牛山东麓各县到山区复地，遍设粮食运输站。以所运粮食百分之十偿付帮助我军运粮的群众，使部队供给无虞，并解决了山区群众春荒困难。在任何困难情况下，部队都坚决遵守群众纪律，如部于进入车村地区时，粮食没有运到，战士们虽忍受饥饿，冒着风雨，继续作战，仍不动群众一点东西，使该地群众深刻认识我军纪律严明。曾受蒋匪恐吓、欺骗而出走的群众，因而纷纷安心回家。若干小股土蒋亦在我军“缴枪不杀，保证安业”的宽大政策影响下，并在当地群众协助争取下，纷纷缴械，回家生产，仅车村、黄村两村，来归者即达一百七十余人。\n    【新华社豫西二十二日电】伊阳县五个月来争取土蒋一千余人来归，县境土蒋全部肃清，全县更加安谧。去年十一月，胡宗南部窜扰子牙山时，伊阳匪首陈旦纠集当地土匪、流氓，并胁迫部分的乡民参加变乱，全部共一千三百余人。该匪所到之处，奸淫掳掠烧杀，无恶不作，群众恨之入骨。经该县地方兵团三次清剿，予以痛击，毙伤俘匪七十余名后，胁从分子即开始逃跑，民主政府乃普遍号召归家安业，并在某地追悼受害烈士的大会上，释放向群众悔过的胁从分子李华英等两名，于是一般土匪皆纷纷来归。土蒋中队长吉德和李思聪两人并率领所属人枪五十多人向西村村公所缴枪自新。阳历年前，民主政府又提出了缴枪回家过好年的口号。同时我军某部并以少数兵力，一举击溃陈旦亲率之匪部六百余人，毙伤俘其一百八十余人，陈旦负伤逃跑。溃散土蒋乃大批悔过缴枪，前后共达六百余人。洛阳大捷后，我民主政府又广泛展开宣传工作，达到了孤立匪首的目的，争取了残余土蒋缴出埋藏武器，悔过自新。至此该县土蒋乃全部肃清。"

When the attack began, under the cover of our fierce artillery fire, the three groups of the demolition squad of the fourth company of the unit, which won the glorious title of \"Red Flag Explosion Squad\" in the great training exercise, charged fiercely in small groups on the open ground outside the east gate and lay down in front of the enemy's deer village. A demolition man from the first group sneaked up and blew a large gap in the first deer village with a loud noise. A minute later, a demolition man from the second group had rushed to the second deer village, dodging the enemy's fire, sent the explosives to the predetermined demolition point, and blew open the second deer village as well. At this time, a demolition man from the third group quickly jumped in, passed through the deer village, and摸摸摸到 the enemy's main bunker, threw the explosives into the gun hole, blasting the enemy to shout for help!

The ninth company demolition squad also carried out four consecutive demolitions, clearing six obstacles of the enemy. They started demolition at 10 p.m. After blasting open two deer villages, the second group leader rushed straight to the enemy's sub-mother bunker despite the hail of bullets. Using a blind spot, he crossed the sub-bunker and blew up the middle mother bunker. Most of the enemies were stunned. He then threw a burst of grenades, eliminating an enemy platoon. At this time, demolition man Xu Cheng of the third group was carrying a long-handled explosive to blow up the outer moat. Who knew that a deer village was lying across the front of the outer moat, and a traffic trench stretched out from the deer village. Suddenly, an enemy in the trench grabbed his long-handled explosive. Xu Cheng stubbornly fought with the enemy. The two demolition men behind him came up to help and finally夺回 the explosive. But because the enemy on the围子 was throwing grenade launchers at them, Xu Cheng was hit by a bullet and sacrificed. Another demolition man was injured, and group leader Sun Yuanji was also hit by four shrapnel. He thought, \"I can still move, so I should continue to complete the mission!\" So he slipped to the back, took a Thompson gun and fired two bursts of bullets at the enemy, then sent the bomb up and blew open the deer village. Behind the deer village were two bunkers. A demolition man from the fourth group threw a hand grenade at a bunker. The enemy in the bunker was so frightened that they fled into the 围子. He took the opportunity to blow open the 围子 gate. But the assault team had not yet caught up. The squad leader with flowers on his legs and the two demolition men from the third and fourth groups consolidated the demolition opening with grenades and hand-thrown explosives. The second group leader went to the bombed bunker, dragged out a Canadian machine gun, and fired fiercely at the enemy in the 围子. The deputy squad leader came back and forth five times to contact the troops. Finally, the entire ninth company came up and broke into the 围子, smoothly developing in depth until the final annihilation of the enemy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 爆破龙王店\n\n1948-07-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　爆破龙王店\n    【新华社豫东前线二十三日电】前线记者报导：豫东战役中，解放军某部爆破员，在七月一日夜攻克敌兵团司令部所在地的龙王店战斗中，扫除层层鹿砦、外壕、围墙、地堡等障碍，开辟了冲锋道路。当攻击开始时，在我猛烈炮火掩护下，大练兵中荣获“红旗爆炸班”光荣称号的该部四连爆破班三个组，在东门外开阔地上，以小群动作猛冲到敌人鹿砦前卧到，第一组一个爆破员偷偷冲上去，一声巨响把第一道鹿砦炸开一个大决口。一分钟之后，第二组一个爆破员已冲到第二道鹿砦前，闪过敌人的射击，将炸药送到预定的爆破点，把第二道鹿砦也炸开了。这时第三组一个爆破员迅速跃进，穿过鹿砦，摸到敌人的母堡前面，将炸药投入枪眼，炸得敌人大喊救命！接着他又转向右面的地堡；摸到枪眼里有挺机枪架在那里，就将炸药放在地堡顶上，把地堡炸塌了。全班完成四次连续爆炸任务，只花了十五分钟。该部九连爆破班也进行四次连续爆破，扫除敌人六道障碍。他们在晚上十时开始爆破，在炸开两道鹿砦后，二组长冒着弹雨直冲到敌人的子母堡前，利用死角越过子堡，炸塌了中间的母堡，敌人大部震昏，他又打了一阵手榴弹，解决敌人一个排。这时三组爆破员许成带着长柄炸药准备上去炸外壕。谁知在外壕前面横着一道鹿砦，鹿砦里又伸出一道交通沟。突然沟里有个敌人抓住了他的长柄炸药。许成顽强的和敌人争夺，后面的两个爆破员上来协助，才把炸药夺回。但因围子上敌人向他们打掷弹筒，许成中弹牺牲，另一爆破员负伤，组长孙元吉身上也中了四处弹片。他想：“我还能动就应当继续完成任务！”便溜到后面拿了一支汤姆枪向敌人连扫两梭子弹，再把炸弹送上去，炸开了鹿砦。鹿砦后面是两个地堡。四组一个爆破员向地堡投了一个手掷炸药，地堡里的敌人吓得逃进围子，他趁机炸开了围子门。但突击队还没赶上来，腿上带花的班长和三、四组的两个爆破员，就用手榴弹和手掷炸药巩固住爆破口，二组长又到炸塌了的地堡里，拖出一挺加拿大机枪，猛烈扫射围子里的敌人。副班长五次来回联络部队。最后九连全部上来突进了围子，顺利的向纵深发展，直至最后完全歼灭敌人。"

    "content": "Correcting Overly High Labor Condition Guarantees and Labor-Management Freedom of Contract\n    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Industry and Commerce Conference, regarding the issues of labor-management, owner-employee, and master-apprentice relationships in private industry and commerce, launched discussions based on the principle of mutual benefit for both labor and capital. Addressing past shortcomings and existing problems, the following principles were established: First, guarantee the freedom of contract for both labor-management, owner-employee, and master-apprentice parties. Create new contracts based on the equality of both parties in personality and mutual benefit, replacing old contracts that created inequality in personality for workers and shop assistants. Upon the expiration of the contract, either party has the right to terminate the contract in accordance with the law. Correct the phenomenon of violating freedom of contract that has occurred in some places in the past, such as prohibiting dismissal according to contract, forcing employment, and unilaterally stipulating wages by any party. Second, basically recognize the old wage system and labor-capital profit-sharing system, but make appropriate and necessary modifications to correct errors such as excessively high wages, excessively high labor profit-sharing, and excessively high labor conditions implemented in some places in the past. Third, recognize the old working hour system, but the working hours of workers employed by some private industrial and mining enterprises are too long, and those whose regular working hours exceed twelve hours should be corrected. Correct the phenomenon in some places of stipulating too many holidays, and workers and shop assistants attending meetings occupying production time and delaying production and business. However, factories should provide workers, shop assistants, and apprentices with necessary rest and sleep time to recover from fatigue and maintain health. Factories should agree that workers, shop assistants, and apprentices use their spare time to participate in various meetings and extracurricular studies organized by the trade union. Fourth, recognize the old master-apprentice relationship and improve it. Abolish the system of corporal punishment for apprentices. The apprenticeship period is generally still three years, but if the apprentice's technical ability has reached the level of a craftsman or shop assistant before the term expires, the term should be shortened. The original system of compensating the master in handicrafts is allowed to be preserved, and its term should be appropriately shortened. Fifth, in larger factories, it is encouraged to establish a factory affairs committee under the leadership of the manager (subject to the factory's consent), and absorb representatives of workers, staff, and technicians to participate, and democratically discuss various issues related to production plans and labor treatment, work, and living systems, and absorb their correct opinions, but the final decision-making power on production plans rests with the manager. Workers and shop assistants should abide by factory and shop rules and respect the manager's leadership in business.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 纠正过高劳动条件保障劳资契约自由\n\n1948-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　纠正过高劳动条件保障劳资契约自由\n    【本报讯】华北工商业会议，对于私营工商业中劳资、东伙、师徒关系问题，根据劳资两利的方针，展开讨论，针对着过去的缺点及现存的问题，确定了以下几条原则。第一、保障劳资、东伙、师徒双方的契约自由，制造旧的对工人店员在人格上不平等的契约，实行在双方人格平等与两利基础之上的新的契约。契约期满，任何一方皆有依法解约之权。纠正过去某些地方曾经发生过的禁止依约解雇、强迫雇佣、及任何方面片面规定工资等违反契约自由的现象。第二、基本上承认旧有的工资制度与劳资分红制度，但作适当的必要的修改，纠正过去某些地方实行过高工资，过高的劳力分红与过高的劳动条件等错误。第三、承认旧有的工时制度，但有些民营工矿雇用工人工时过长，经常劳动时间超过十二小时以上者，应予纠正。纠正某些地方曾规定过多的假日，工人店员开会侵占生产时间，耽误生产与营业的现象。但厂方应给工人、店员、学徒以必要的休息睡眠时间，使能恢复疲劳，保持健康。厂方应同意工人店员学徒利用业余时间参加工会组织的各种会议与业余学习。第四、承认旧有的师徒关系，并加以改进。废除对学徒的体罚制度。学徒期限一般仍为三年，但年限未满，其技术能力已到达工匠或店员水平者，年限应当缩短。在手工业中原有的酬师制度准予保存，其年限应适当缩短。第五、在较大工厂中，提倡在经理领导下成立厂务委员会（须经厂方同意），吸收工人、职员、技师代表参加，民主讨论有关生产计划及劳动待遇、工作、生活制度的各项问题，吸收他们的正确意见，但关于生产计划之最后决定权在经理。工人与店员应当遵守厂规铺规，尊重经理在业务上的领导。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Comrade Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association, issued an urgent appeal to Mr. Hoskins, President of the American Friends Service Committee China Service Unit, and Mr. Jernudd, representative of the American Red Cross in China, regarding the Yellow River flood control problem. The original telegram is as follows:\n\nMr. Hoskins, President of the American Friends Service Committee China Service Unit, and to Mr. Jernudd of the American Red Cross: I am now representing the China Liberated Areas Relief Association to make an urgent appeal to you regarding the danger of breaches on the southern bank of the Yellow River due to the obstruction of the People's efforts to repair the dangerous sections of the Yellow River embankment by the Kuomintang army. Since the Yellow River returned to its old course last year, our liberated area governments and people have continued to repair the river堤 works, expending enormous manpower and material resources. Consequently, the embankment works on the northern bank have been largely completed. However, the section from Dongming to Juancheng, at the junction of Hebei and Shandong provinces, and the section near Jinan, on the southern bank of the Yellow River, have been repeatedly damaged and cannot be completed due to frequent incursions by the Kuomintang army. Now that the summer flood season has arrived, the Kuomintang army has again concentrated five divisions and thirteen brigades, lingering along the Dongming, Juancheng, and Yuncheng line, controlling the Yellow River embankment, and destroying the river works, making it impossible for the nearby residents to carry out any flood control work even with tens of thousands of people mobilized. The Kuomintang air force is also carrying out wanton acts of destruction, and recently, more than one hundred people have been injured or killed due to bombing and strafing, forcing the flood control work to be interrupted. Currently, the water level continues to rise, and the southern bank is on the verge of breaching. Once the embankment collapses and the water rushes out, not only will the people in several provinces of our liberated areas bear the brunt, but also the residents in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially the Kuomintang army now on the southern bank of the Yellow River, will hardly escape. You, gentlemen, and the organizations you represent, have always regarded disaster relief as your responsibility for issues concerning the lives and properties of millions of Chinese people, and I believe you must be concerned. Therefore, I specifically request you to convey our appeal to all international and Chinese relief and charitable organizations, requesting the Kuomintang army and air force to cease obstructing the local residents' flood control and embankment repair work, and requesting the Kuomintang water conservancy authorities and international relief organizations to provide the local residents with urgent technical and material assistance to facilitate the river works. If you, gentlemen, are willing to come to the liberated areas to discuss specific relief issues, we will sincerely welcome you. However, the water situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and we have no convenient means of communication with you, so we are specifically using radio broadcast to express our appeal and request, hoping that foreign news agencies can forward it to Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Jernudd after listening to this broadcast, in order to save the lives of millions of people. We will be extremely grateful.\n\n　　　　　　　　　Dong Biwu, Chairman of the China Liberated Areas Relief Association\n　　　　　　　　　　　　July 25, 1948\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 董必武同志为黄河问题向世界呼吁请求援助\n\n1948-07-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　董必武同志为黄河问题向世界呼吁请求援助\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中国解放区救济总会主任委员董必武氏，为黄河抢险问题向世界公谊会中国服务会会长郝思金斯氏，及美国红十字会驻华代表朱诺德氏发出紧急呼吁，原电如下：\n    世界公谊会中国服务会会长郝思金斯先生并转美国红十字会朱诺德先生：我现在代表中国解放区救济总会，为国民党军队阻挠人民抢修黄河险工致黄河南岸已有决口危险一事，特向你们提出紧急呼吁。黄河自去年归故以来，我解放区政府和人民即继续修复河堤工作，所费人力物力极大，因之北岸堤工大体完成。惟独黄河南岸河北、山东两省交界处之东明至鄄城一段，及济南附近一段，则因国民党军队常往侵挠，致修复工作迭遭破坏，无法完工。现夏泛已至，而国民党军队复集五个师十三个旅之众，徘徊于东明、鄄城、郓城之线，控制黄河堤，破坏河工，致使附近居民虽集中数万人力图抢险亦无从下手。国民党空军更从而肆虐，最近期内因遭轰炸扫射致伤亡者竟达一百余人，抢险工作遂被迫中断。目前水势继长，南岸已濒决口危险。一旦堤溃水奔，不但我解放区数省人民首当其冲，即国民党统治区居民，首先是现在黄河南岸之国民党军队亦难幸免。对于此等关系千百万中国人民生命财产问题，两先生及两先生所代表的团体，素以救灾济难为己任者，想必关怀。因之我特请两先生向国际和中国一切救济慈善团体，传达我们的呼吁，要求国民党军队及空军停止阻挠当地居民的抢险修堤工作，要求国民党水利机关及国际救济团体给当地居民以技术上物资上的紧急援助，以利河工的进行。倘蒙两先生慨允，并愿来解放区一商救济的具体问题，我们当竭诚欢迎。惟水势日迫，我们与两先生又无通航之便，故特借无线电广播表达我们的呼吁和请求，希望各外国通讯社于收听此广播后能代为送达郝思金斯与朱诺德两先生，以援救千百万人民的生命，我们将不胜感激之至。\n    　　　　　　　　　中国解放区救济总会主任委员董必武\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四八年七月二十五日"

During the blocking action at Xugang on the 3rd, Guo Jisheng, the battalion commander of the unit, suddenly fainted on the battlefield due to the hot weather and days of excessive combat fatigue. When he woke up, he found himself being carried to the rear, but his high sense of revolutionary responsibility made him completely forget his fatigue, and he returned to the front line to direct the battle the next morning. Kong Xiangtan, a combat hero and battalion commander of a certain battalion, was wounded in the Kaifeng Campaign. Although his wound had not yet healed, upon hearing that there was another combat mission, he rushed from the rear hospital to the front, requesting to return to the battalion to direct the battle. The higher authorities repeatedly tried to dissuade him, but he firmly refused. On July 2, when the 189th Regiment of the 83rd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army fiercely attacked our army's position near Guanzhuang, Battalion Commander Kong Xiangtan braved intense artillery fire and returned to his combat command post. During the most intense fighting in the Xugang battle, Wang, the division commander of our certain division, personally went to the forefront to direct the troops, separated from the enemy only by a dry river. Such examples were extremely common throughout the entire campaign. Since the Kaifeng Campaign, although the unit had been marching and fighting continuously for more than 20 days, it was still able to overcome difficulties and fatigue, and its combat morale remained as high as ever.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch: The families of workers in mines and factories in Northeast China, as well as urban women, are actively participating in various production efforts. Over 2,100 women in the Second Coal Mine area, under the leadership of the mine's women's association, have taken on the primary responsibility of cultivating 1,150 hectares of land within the mining area. Every morning, after preparing meals for their husbands to go to work, they gather in the fields to work. In addition to the above-mentioned cultivation tasks, women at the First Mine have also reclaimed more than 20 mu of wasteland. They have also organized a textile factory with dozens of people, with the women of each mine spinning thread for weaving. Profits for April and May reached 3.99 million yuan. Some strong women in the Second Mine also participated in various odd jobs at the mine, replacing male laborers. In order to leverage the labor of women in workers' families and increase family income, the Harbin Tram Factory's trade union, through its welfare and women's departments, jointly organized production by workers' family members. They introduced more than 70 young women to work in toothbrush and match factories, provided production materials, and organized family members to sew shoe soles and spin yarn. The factory also recruited female workers from workers' families, training 32 female workers in the electrical materials, coil winding, and artificial mica departments. The Qiqihar district and street governments actively support and organize women's production. In the Fifth Street of the Second District, there are nearly 200 women spinners who can spin about 1,100 jin of thread each month. Women in the Seventh Street of the Fourth District have also voluntarily gathered 16 sewing machines to establish a small factory, recruiting women to participate in making military uniforms. To facilitate the participation of housewives in production, the street has also established a kindergarten that can accommodate more than 160 children. With the help of the government, women in other streets are also heavily involved in sideline production such as sewing shoe soles, spinning thread, and weaving mats, improving family life. After the Second Street of Jiamusi City mobilized women to spin thread, the number of spinners has increased to more than 2,000. The enthusiasm for production among the spinners is extremely high, and they are now working to improve quality and eliminate third-grade thread. In Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, under the active spinning and weaving of more than 13,500 women, the textile industry has achieved great development. There were originally four textile factories during the puppet Manchurian regime, and now there are nine weaving factories. Forty thousand jin of cotton are often distributed to spinners in various places. In recent years, a total of 140,000 jin of thread have been spun and more than 20,000 bolts of cloth have been woven, solving and improving the living difficulties of the urban poor.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北职工眷属城市妇女积极参加各项生产\n\n1948-07-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北职工眷属城市妇女积极参加各项生产\n    【新华社东北电】东北各矿山、工厂职工眷属及城市妇女，纷纷投入各种生产工作。第二煤矿区二千一百余妇女在该矿妇女的领导下担负了矿区内一千一百五十垧土地耕种的主要任务。每天清晨她们照料丈夫吃过饭上工后，就集合到地里工作。第一矿妇女于参加上述耕种任务之外，并增开荒地二十多亩。另外还组织一个拥有数十人的纺织厂，由各矿妇女纺线供给织布。四、五两月赢利达三百九十九万元。第二矿若干强壮妇女并参加矿上一些杂工工作，代替了男子杂工。哈尔滨电车厂职工会为了发挥工人家庭中妇女的劳动力和增加工人家庭收入，特由福利部与妇女部共同组织职工家属生产，介绍了七十余年轻妇女参加牙刷、洋火等工厂工作，并供给生产材料，组织家属纳鞋底，纺纱等。厂方亦招收工人家属妇女，培养电材部、卷线部、人造云母部等女工三十二名。齐齐哈尔各区街政府积极扶助与组织妇女生产。二区五街已有纺妇近二百名，每月能纺线一千一百斤左右。四区七街妇女并自动集中十六架缝纫机，成立一个小工厂，吸收妇女参加做军衣。该街为便利家庭妇女参加生产，并成立幼稚园一所，可容纳儿童一百六十余名。其他各街妇女亦均在政府帮助下，大批卷入纳鞋底、纺线、编席等副业生产，改善家庭生活。佳木斯市二街动员妇女纺线后，纺妇已增至两千余名。纺妇生产情绪极为高涨，现正为提高质量，消灭第三等线而努力。松江省双城县在一万三千五百余妇女积极纺织下，纺织业已获得极大发展，伪满时原有纺织厂四家，现已有织布厂九家。经常有四万斤棉花分散于各地纺妇手中。年来共纺线十四万斤，织布两万余匹。解决与改善了城区贫民的生活困难。"

In Linzhang County of the Third District, the Zhang River breached at Santaicun in the Sixth District and Qianwangzhuang in the Fifth District, inundating crops in more than ten villages. Within Chengci, the @Niu River flows directly into the Fuyang River, forming a \"T\" shape. The Fuyang River water has overflowed from the riverbanks, affecting over ten villages. On the 21st, another heavy rain fell in Ci County, and the Fuyang River water flowed torrentially through Handan, Chengci, and Yongnian. According to the masses, the water was more fierce than in the sixth year of the Republic of China. In the first district of Yongnian, the Fuyang River breached at Qutun, but it has now been plugged. Many crops in the upstream areas of Chengci, Handan, and Quzhou (Qi Zhi) were flooded. On the evening of the 21st, mountain water poured into the Fuyang River from the @River. Due to the excessive water flow, it reached the urban area of Handan, causing nearly 3,000 houses to collapse. The municipal government is currently coordinating housing, distributing relief grain, and resettling disaster victims. In Wei County, the Zhang River breached in seven places, and small breaches in four places have been plugged. In Daming, the Zhang River breached in three places; the breach at Nan Shangcun alone inundated more than 20 villages. Huilong in Zhangnan County is surrounded by water, flooding more than 30 villages to the north. In Ningnan County of the Fourth District, the Sha River breached at places such as Zhao Zhuang, north of Suqiu and south of Zhao Zhuang, flooding nearly a hundred hectares of land. Ren County town has been surrounded by water, and the water has crossed the bridge three li north of the city. Details are unclear. In Nanhe County, the Sha River and @River have breached in several places. Longyao town is surrounded by a vast expanse of water, six or seven feet deep in deep areas and two or three feet deep in shallow areas, with twenty to thirty villages flooded. Cadres and the masses in the disaster-stricken counties are making every effort to plug the breaches and overcome the flood. County party secretaries and county heads personally went to the river embankment to lead the masses to plug the breaches. Each county has organized a flood prevention headquarters to rush to plug the breaches and patrol day and night. The downstream counties of the Fuyang River have all made flood prevention arrangements.\n　　[Jizhong News] The Tenth Special Commissioner's Office and the Tenth Military Sub-district's Administrative and Political Departments jointly issued flood prevention instructions, pointing out that due to continuous rain in various places, river water may flood; in addition, the Wang Bandit Fenggang is attempting to breach dikes to flood and harm the people, making this year's flood prevention work particularly important. Militiamen and people's militia should take guns in one hand and shovels in the other, implement a combination of armed work, and carry out repairs. Important dike sections should be given armed protection during the most dangerous times of repair. The serious waste of manpower and material resources in past river works should be strictly corrected, old stockpiles should be quickly cleared, and a strict income and expenditure management system should be established. It is also necessary to strengthen water situation reporting and flood prevention reporting.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南三四分区洪水成灾　政府领导群众全力抢堵决口\n\n1948-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南三四分区洪水成灾\n  　政府领导群众全力抢堵决口\n    【冀南电】近日阴雨连绵，山洪暴发，冀南三分区邯郸、成磁、临漳、魏县、大名，四分区宁南、隆尧、任县等县所属河系均泛滥成灾。三分区临漳县境的漳河在六区三台村及五区前王庄决口，十余村的田禾被淹。成磁境内＠牛河直灌滏阳河，成“丁”字形，滏阳河水已从河岸漫出，有十数村被灾。二十一日磁县又落大雨，滏阳河水经邯郸、成磁、永年汹涌而下，据群众谈：水势比民国六年还猛。永年一区滏阳河曲屯开口，现已堵住。上游成磁、邯郸、曲周（企之）被淹田禾甚多。二十一日晚山水由＠河注滏阳河，因水势过大，流至邯郸市区，房子倒塌近三千间。市府正调剂房子，发放救济粮，安置灾民。魏县境内漳河决口七处，现已堵住小口四处。大名境内漳河决口三处，仅南上村一处决口即淹及二十多村。漳南县回隆周围皆水，向北淹了三十多村。四分区宁南境内沙河在素邱以北赵庄以南等处决口，淹地近百顷。任县城已被水围住，水势从城北三里桥越桥而过，详情不明。南河境内沙河、＠河决口数处，隆尧城周围已成一片汪洋，深处六七尺，浅处二三尺，被淹村庄二三十个。被灾各县干部群众正全力抢堵决口，克服水患。县委书记、县长亲临河堤，领导群众堵口，各县都已组织了防汛指挥部，抢堵决口，昼夜巡逻。滏阳河下流各县皆已作了防汛布置。\n    【冀中讯】十专署及十分区司政两部联合发出防汛指示。指出：因各地阴雨连绵，河水可能汛滥；加以王匪风岗企图扒堤放水淹害人民，使今年防汛工作特别重要。民工和民兵应一手拿枪一手拿锨，实行武工结合，进行修护。重要堤段在最危险时，应武装掩护抢修。对过去河工人力物力严重浪费现象应严加纠正，旧存物资应很快清理，建立严格的收支保管制度。并且要加强水情报告与防汛报导。"

    "content": "Beiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office\n\n　　Emphasize Seizing the Time for Replanting and Disaster Relief\n\n　　Issue Urgent Instructions and Provide Specific On-the-Ground Leadership\n\n[Beiyue News] The Jianping and Pingshan counties along the Hutuo River suffered particularly severe flooding. According to the masses, the river swelled dramatically on the 22nd and 23rd of this month, the worst since 1939. Much of the wasteland along the river in Jianping was washed away. In Hongzidian, only one out of twenty households outside the two attics remained. In Pingshan, the Dading Weir of the Dachuan Canal was destroyed, many canals were silted up, and much of the land along the small rivers was washed away; more than 200 mu were washed away in Donghuishe, and more than 100 mu were silted up in Nanwanglou. In the first district of Pingshan, 9,658 mu of crops were flooded, with some fields submerged in two to three feet of water for three or four days. The flooded land urgently needs to be replanted or supplemented. Almost all of the cotton on more than one qing of land in Dongwanglou needs to be replanted. After the Beiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee repeatedly sounded the alarm in the People's Daily, pointing out the dangers of Pingshan's laissez-faire attitude towards production, it immediately grasped the above situation and issued urgent instructions, pointing out that it is imperative for all counties to vigorously plant late autumn crops. \"Seize the time to plant,\" \"seize the time to reclaim wasteland,\" and \"prevent floods and rush to rescue\" to properly resettle the disaster-stricken people. The Beginning of Autumn (solar calendar) on August 7th is less than half a month away. If we do not seize the time to replant, we will miss the agricultural season and there will be no way to remedy the situation. (1) If the masses have difficulty obtaining seeds for late planting, they should be urged to find ways to purchase them themselves, or to help each other; the production promotion cooperatives should immediately purchase seeds to assist in coordination. (2) To solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power, mutual aid should be promoted. In areas where labor is particularly scarce, the masses should be organized to carry out \"assaults\" in the form of large-scale labor. Due to the large number of livestock working in Jingxing, Pingshan, and Jianping counties, it is necessary to effectively coordinate solutions. Villages with more livestock can send some to help villages with less livestock, trading labor for work, with fodder provided by the users. (3) Organize as many personnel from government agencies and schools as possible, as well as pack mules and horses, to vigorously help the masses replant. The instructions also pointed out that in the process of replanting and supplementing, special attention should be paid to investigating and reclaiming wasteland, clearly identifying the amount of wasteland, the reasons for it, and providing concrete solutions. For the land abandoned by military families and revolutionary martyrs due to lack of labor, it is necessary to resolutely organize people to cultivate it on their behalf. Landlords and old rich peasants who abandon land because they dislike its poor quality can be forced to plant it; wasteland abandoned due to undetermined land rights (such as military land or land not yet distributed) should be reclaimed by mobilizing the masses. The wasteland reclaimed during this planting will be exempt from burdens this year. When reclaiming wasteland, households affected by the floods this time should have priority. Regarding flood prevention and emergency rescue, the flood control projects that have been destroyed should be supervised for repair, and those that have not been destroyed but are in danger should be inspected and prevented. Those that need to be added should be added as soon as possible. For particularly large projects, the Commissioner's Office can subsidize part of the river management costs. For low-lying, damp land, drainage methods should be studied with the masses, and tree planting during the rainy season should be combined with flood prevention. Regarding the resettlement of disaster-stricken households, the village should be responsible for helping those without housing to find temporary accommodation. Those who have suffered serious losses due to the collapse of houses and have problems with their livelihoods should be given appropriate relief from the existing production loan grains in each county. At present, the Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office have formed two shock work groups, led by Deputy Commissioner Wang and Section Chief Han of the Industry Section, to go to Jingxing, which suffered from severe drought in the past, and the disaster-stricken villages along the Hutuo River to carry out shock reclamation and emergency rescue. At the same time, personnel from all departments at the district level have been prepared to help the masses in the villages with replanting in an organized manner.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Wang Feng, Feng Yunting, He Jianping)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳四地委暨专署　重视抢种救灾　一面发出紧急指示同时下乡具体领导\n王峰　封云亭　何建平\n1948-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳四地委暨专署\n  　重视抢种救灾\n  　一面发出紧急指示同时下乡具体领导\n    【北岳讯】滹沱河畔的建屏、平山两县，水灾异常严重，据群众谈：本月二十二、三日河水暴涨，为一九三九年以来最大的一次。建屏沿河荒滩大部冲光，洪子店两阁外二十来户，冲得只剩了一家。平山大川渠的大顶堰被冲毁，不少水渠淤塞，许多沿小河的土地亦被冲毁不少；东回舍冲坏二百多亩，南望楼百多亩被淤。平山一区被淹坏的田禾达九千六百五十八亩，好些田地积水二、三尺，三四天未退，被灾土地极需改种或补种，东望楼一顷多地的棉花，几乎需要全部改种。北狱四地委在人民日报数次敲警钟即指出平山生产自流的警惕下，随即抓紧了上述情况，特发出紧急指示，指出各县全力种植晚秋作物，刻不容缓。“抢种”“抢荒”“防洪、抢险”切实安置受灾群众。现立秋（阳历）八月七日已不距到半月，如不抓紧抢种，就会错过农时，无法补救。（一）群众进行晚种，种籽困难，应督促群众自己想法购买，或互助周济；生产推进社要立即购买，协助调剂。（二）为解决人力畜力的困难，应提倡拨工互助，在劳力特别缺乏地区，应组织群众用大拨工的形式进行“突击”。井陉、平山、建屏三县因牲口大量出勤，更需切实设法调剂解决，牲口较多村庄可抽调一部前往牲口缺乏村庄帮助，顶战勤工，草料由使用户供给。（三）尽量组织机关学校人员及驮骡马匹，大力帮助群众抢种。指示并指出：抢种补种中要特别注意查荒抢荒，切实查明荒地数量多少，什么原因，要具体解决。军工烈属因无劳力荒的土地，要坚决组织代耕种好。地主旧富农嫌地坏而荒了的可强制他种；因地权未确定（如军田或暂未分出的地）而荒了的则应发动群众抢荒，此次抢种的荒地，今年一律不出负担。抢荒时，此次遭水灾户应有优先权。关于防洪抢险，已被冲毁的防洪工程要督促修筑，未被冲而有危险的应该检查防止，需增修的赶快增修，工程特大的，专署可补助一部治河费。下洼阴湿土地，应与群众研究泄水办法，雨季植树应与防洪结合进行。关于安置受灾户，没房住的应由村里负责帮助筹划借住。因房屋倒塌受到严重损失，生活发生问题的，由各县现存生产贷粮中酌情救济。现地委、专署已组成两个突击工作组，由王副专员及实业科韩科长率领，分赴过去旱灾较重的井陉及滹沱河两岸受灾村进行突击抢荒，与抢险。同时分区一级各机关人员，已准备有组织地帮助驻村群众抢种。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王峰、封云亭、何建平）"

According to TASS, Philadelphia, July 22nd: Wallace, the presidential candidate of the US Third Party, recently issued a statement to the press condemning the government's persecution of American Communist leaders, declaring, \"Defending the civil rights of Communists is the first line of defense in defending the freedom of democratic people.\" He continued: \"The histories of Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain have taught us that suppressing the Communist Party is only the first step in attacking the democratic rights of labor and national, racial, and political minorities.\" Wallace, in exposing the US government's purpose in persecuting the American Communist Party, stated: The government and members of both parties in Congress use arbitrary words to create headlines, use headlines to create terror, and use terror to maintain power. Their purpose is to prevent the opposition party from speaking out against the two parties' unanimous \"tough\" foreign policy. However, millions of Americans have expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's refusal to negotiate with the Soviet Union for a peaceful resolution of the current differences. Wallace predicted that under various fabricated pretexts, the US government would carry out further white terror and attacks on other minorities, as well as continuous attacks on the New Party.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th.\n\n　　The Florence Nightingales of the East China Field Army\n\n    The female medical and health personnel of the East China Field Army have made remarkable achievements in medical work during the Liberation War in the past two years. They constitute the majority of the East China Field Army's hospital staff. According to recent statistics, they account for 80% to 90% of the staff in the rear health education organs, field and rear hospitals. Even in the battlefield medical organs, they account for more than 30%. Among them, there are not only many skilled female doctors and medical personnel, but also female health department chiefs, hospital directors, and medical team leaders who bear important leadership responsibilities; there are also very young female \"little devils\" (nurses) and older laundry workers. They work without distinction from their male comrades, and sometimes even do better.\n    In order to adapt to large-scale mobile warfare, the General Health Department of the Military Region proposed the policy of \"high mobility, large-scale admission\" and \"where there is fighting, there is admission.\" In order to actively implement this policy, they underwent rigorous training. They practiced running, climbing obstacles, crossing single-plank bridges, and jumping over ditches. Administratively, it was stipulated that they should run fifteen li per hour with full equipment (backpack and work tools), but some of them actually ran eighteen li. They trained themselves to be like Liberation Army soldiers, able to run with the army on the battlefield, often braving enemy bombing, going in and out of gunfire to rescue the wounded, and persisting in their work. In the Menglianggu campaign to annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's elite 74th Division, a certain hospital rushed to the battlefield overnight. After arriving, they formed a wounded transfer station to receive and transfer the wounded. Due to the small number of staff, they mobilized and organized local rural women, and led them to help with the reception and transfer work. After the wounded arrived at the station, they needed to be registered, medicated, bandaged, and fed, and then transferred to the medical team. Because they organized a large number of liberated women and children to participate, and because of scientific division of labor and skilled movements, it took an average of only about two minutes to receive and transfer a wounded person. The surgical teams, including many female doctors and medical personnel, also had extremely high work efficiency. On average, it took only eight or nine minutes to perform a surgery (from small surgeries such as incisions to large surgeries such as laparotomy and leg amputation). They all worked hard to master their skills. Now, female medical personnel can independently perform general suturing, bullet removal, and other surgeries.\n    Under the call of Rao Shushi, Political Commissar of the East China Field Army, to \"serve the wounded wholeheartedly,\" they demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary spirit of selflessness and altruism. Here, we can cite the story of female medical team leader Li Landing as a representative of this spirit. Li Landing and her medical team were jokingly called \"Nightingale\" and \"Nightingale Team\" by the East China Field Army, that is, comparing her to the British Florence Nightingale, the founder of battlefield nursing work. This comparison is not wrong. As early as seven years ago, when she was only seventeen years old, Li Landing took on the medical work of the New Fourth Army in the dangerous environment of Japanese and puppet strongholds along the Yangtze River, and has never left the front line since then. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, she often led a dozen or so wounded soldiers to deal with the enemy. On stormy nights, she often crossed the blockade line to move and bury medicine boxes, or groped through dozens of miles of dark roads to supply medicines to the wounded and sick. Long-term fatigue caused her to cough up blood, but she was still unwilling to rest. In the winter of 1944, she transferred several seriously wounded soldiers. When crossing the river, the boat leaked and was about to sink. She immediately took the lead in jumping into the cold, deep water to push the boat ashore, rescuing the wounded and freezing so much that she coughed up blood again. In the autumn of 1946, when our army took the initiative to withdraw from Huaibei, her medical team accommodated more than 500 wounded and sick soldiers at the rear of the troops. At that time, not only were there no medicines, but because the masses had mostly scattered, even stretchers and food were difficult to find. In addition, there were enemy planes bombing overhead, enemy troops chasing behind, and two consecutive days of heavy rain, with water knee-deep, the situation was extremely critical. At this time, she resolutely led the entire team to mobilize local women to carry stretchers, and endured the unbearable fatigue to personally take the lead in carrying them. When she was carrying a heavy stretcher across the river, she lost her footing in the middle of the river due to weak legs and dizziness, and broke her second rib on the left chest. But she still insisted on bringing more than 500 wounded and sick soldiers to southern Shandong without losing a single one.\n    There are many such heroines who can be counted in the East China Field Army. Female doctor Jiang Jie, in a major battle, in order to reduce the fatigue of other medical personnel, she changed the dressings of 260 wounds by herself, without resting for a day and a night. Female health worker Jiang Nanping volunteered to carry stretchers and carry the wounded in a certain battle. She had not slept for two days and nights, but she still insisted on going to the front line to rescue people. Under the enemy planes' frantic strafing, her right arm was injured. But disregarding the severe pain of her own wound, she ran into the burning first-aid station and rescued two wounded soldiers. Dressing squad leader Yu Lanxiang, due to poisoning in her work, had undergone six operations, and her arms were covered with scars; her whole body had also suffered from toxic sores. But as soon as she had an operation, she immediately volunteered to help others sort out dressings.\n    It is in this way that they have been trained in the war, under the education of the Party, to become capable and loyal quartermasters for the wounded, so that the vast majority of the wounded can quickly return to the troops. In the eight months of cruel war from July 1946 to March 1947, the vast majority of the wounded admitted to the hospital recovered and returned to the team, and only 3.3% died. According to the treatment statistics of the Menglianggu campaign for 45 days, the death rate was only 1.6%. The outstanding contributions of the East China Field Army's medical work to the Liberation War are inseparable from their efforts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华野的南丁格尔们\n\n1948-07-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华野的南丁格尔们\n    华东野战军的女医务卫生人员，两年来在解放战争中的医疗工作上功绩卓著。她们占华东野战军医院工作人员的大部分。据最近统计，在后方的卫生教育机关，野战及后方医院工作人员中，她们占百分之八十到九十。就是在战地的部队医疗机关中，她们也占百分之三十以上。她们中间不仅有许多技术熟练的女医生，女医务员，也有负重要领导责任的纵队卫生部长、院长和医疗队长；有很年轻的女小鬼（护理员）和年岁较大的洗衣员。她们和男同志毫无分别的进行工作，甚至有时还作得更好。\n    为适应大规模运动战，军区总卫生部各院都提出：“高度运动，大量收容”、“哪里打仗、哪里收容”方针。她们为积极执行此方针，曾经过了严格的锻炼。她们练习跑路，爬障碍，过独木桥，跳水沟等。行政上规定全副武装（背上背包，带着工作用具）每小时要跑十五里，但是她们竟有的跑到了十八里。她们把自己锻炼得和解放军战士一样，能随军奔驰于战场，经常冒着敌机的轰炸，出入枪林弹雨中抢救伤员，坚持工作。歼灭蒋匪精锐七十四师的孟良崮战役中，某医院连夜赶到战地。到达后就组成伤员转运总站收转伤员。由于工作人员少，她们就动员组织当地农村妇女，并带领她们帮助进行收转工作。伤员到站后，均需经过登记，并分别进行用药、包扎、吃饭等，然后转送医疗队。由于她们组织了大批翻身妇女、儿童参加，由于分工科学、动作熟练，故平均收转一个伤员只用约两分钟的时间。包括许多女医生、女医务员的手术队，工作效率亦极高。平均作一个手术（从切开等小手术到剖腹锯腿等大手术）只用八九分钟。她们都努力于掌握技术。现在一般缝合、取子弹等手术，女医务员们都能单独进行。\n    她们在华东野战军饶漱石政委“全心全意为伤员服务”的号召下，表现了高度的舍己为群的革命精神。在这里，我们可以举出女医疗队长李蓝丁的故事作为她们的这种精神的一个代表，李蓝丁和她的医疗队被华野部队双关地称为“南丁”和“南丁队”，就是说，把她比做那个战地护士工作的创始者英国的南丁格尔女士。这个比方是没有错的。早在七年前，还在十七岁的时候，李蓝丁就在长江边日伪据点林立的危险环境中担任了新四军的医疗工作，以后就一直没有离开过前线。在抗日战争时期，她曾经常常带着十几个伤员与敌周旋，在风雨的夜间，她常常穿过封锁线搬移和埋藏药箱，或者摸索几十里的黑路供应伤病员的药品。长期的劳累使她吐了血，但是她仍然不愿意休息。一九四四年冬，她转运几个重伤员，在过河时船漏得快沉了，她立即带头跳入寒冷的深水中推船靠岸，救出伤员而冻得再次吐血。一九四六年秋，我军主动撤离淮北时，她的医疗队在部队最后面收容了五百多伤病员。当时不但没有药品，因为群众大都跑散了，连担架和饮食都很难找，加以上有敌机轰炸，后有敌军追赶，又有两天连下大雨，水深及膝，情况异常危急。这时她毅然率领全队人员动员当地妇女来抬担架，并忍受无比的疲劳亲自领头抬。当她抬着沉重的担架过河时，因腿软头晕，在河心站立不稳而扭断了左胸第二条肋骨。但是她仍然坚持把五百多伤病员带到了鲁南，没有失掉一个。\n    象这样的女英雄，在华野部队里还可以数出很多。女医生姜洁，在一次大战役中，为了减轻其他医务人员的疲劳，她一个人一连换完二百六十个伤口的药，一天一夜没有休息。女卫生员蒋南屏在某次战斗中，自告奋勇抬担架背伤员，已经两昼夜没有睡觉了，但是她仍然坚持去火线抢救。在敌机疯狂扫射下，她的右臂负了伤。但是她不顾自己伤口的剧痛，跑进着火的急救所抢出两个伤员。敷料班长于兰香，因工作中中毒，开过六次刀，手膀上满是疤痕；全身亦曾因之害毒疮。但是她刚开过刀，立即又自动去帮助别人整理敷料。\n    她们就是这样在战争中，在党的教育下，把自己锻炼成伤员的能干而忠诚的勤务员，而使绝大部分的伤员能迅速的重返部队。一九四六年七月至一九四七年三月八个月残酷的战争中，入院的伤员绝大部分伤愈归队，死亡的则仅百分之三点三。据孟良崮战役四十五天治疗统计，死亡的仅及百分之一点六。华野医务工作对解放战争的这种卓越功绩是和她们的努力分不开的。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北二十四日电】"

    "content": "Saluting the Female Cadres Working on the Front Lines of the East China Field Army\n　　Deng Yingchao\n　　Recently, I met Li Landing, a young female comrade who is serving as a medical team leader among you, and heard about your various situations on the front lines, especially the many admirable and heroic deeds in medical rescue work. These deeds deeply moved and encouraged us!\n　　You account for 30% of all medical personnel on the front lines of the East China Field Army, and 80% to 90% in the rear. Among you, some hold positions such as Deputy Minister of the Army Health Department, Hospital President, Medical Team Leader, Director of Medical Affairs, Section Chief, Instructor, Medical Officer, Company Medical Officer, and Head of the Transfer Station. You often work in the wilderness, mountains, and along the Yellow River, about thirty to fifty miles away from the war front. Amidst the rumbling of artillery fire and the bombing of Chiang Kai-shek's and the U.S.'s planes, you accept one arduous task of receiving the wounded after another without fear or fatigue. During the famous Battle of Menglianggu, some of you worked tirelessly, day and night, without hunger or sleep, continuously and methodically for four days and four nights, resulting in more than six hundred heroes, including yourselves. What heroic and touching deeds!\n　　You often move with the troops, maintaining a marching speed of fifteen miles per hour with the soldiers, learning to climb walls and houses, overcome obstacles, and cross ditches. Sometimes you continue marching urgently for one to two hundred miles to reach the designated place to accept the task, and then immediately begin your work. As a result of your joint efforts with other medical personnel, 60% to 70% of the commanders and fighters of the East China Field Army, who were gloriously wounded in the People's Liberation War over the past two years, have recovered and returned to the front lines. What a great achievement and contribution!\n　　Among you emerged the female hero Jiang Nanping. She participated in six battles in more than a year. Once, she volunteered to carry a stretcher for fifty to sixty miles. After being awake for two days and nights, she was ordered to set off again, marching for another night. At dawn, the battle began, and she immediately started emergency rescue work. At this moment, a bullet fired by enemy planes swept down from the sky and hit her right arm. She was wounded. As soon as she was bandaged, she heard that two wounded soldiers' residences had caught fire due to enemy strikes. Disregarding her pain, she selflessly and fearlessly rushed into the raging fire and rescued two wounded soldiers. Among you, there were Ding Huiqing and Li Landing, who broke their ribs while climbing mountains and wading through rivers to urgently rescue and transport the wounded; Yao Jian, who was poisoned and thrown into a lake by local bandits and secret agents in the middle of the night while inquiring about the wounded; and many other model workers and brave soldiers who were wounded, disabled, or sacrificed. You who are alive, the scars on your bodies will forever be your glorious medals. The heroic names of those female martyrs who sacrificed themselves will forever live in the hearts of the people. You are the outstanding daughters of the Chinese people, you are good cadres of the Party and the People's Liberation Army, and you are the glory of Chinese women!\n　　Among you are female workers from factories in big cities, housewives from rural areas, and more often female student intellectuals. Except for a very few, most of you have not studied medicine. Under the education of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, and under the education of the military, political, medical and health leadership organs of the East China Field Army, you have worked hard to learn medical skills and techniques in a short period of time, overcome various difficulties, and shoulder important tasks. You are loved by the wounded and respected by the entire army and the people. I believe that you will not become arrogant or complacent because of all this. I hope that you will continue to persevere tenaciously, develop your strengths, overcome some of the shortcomings that still exist in your diagnosis and care, strengthen your spirit of high affection for the wounded, and improve the efficiency of your technical and medical work, so as to strive to cure more wounded soldiers and send them back to the front lines.\n　　Your heroic work, hard struggle, self-sacrifice, and spirit of wholeheartedly serving the wounded, serving the war, and serving the people are worthy of learning by all female comrades in the Party. Female comrades in all regions and on all fronts should learn from you, spur themselves on, concentrate on their work, do their jobs well, overcome individualistic thoughts, abandon petty calculations in life, and serve the people better!\n　　Your work achievements prove that the East China Field Army's leadership organs' policy of cultivating a large number of female cadres and boldly using female cadres is correct and effective. This policy should also be adopted by other leadership organs. In particular, the construction work in the old liberated areas and the departments of various rear institutions that are suitable for female comrades to work in should employ more female cadres boldly, so as to free up more male cadres to go to the front lines and develop work in the new areas. Cultivating and employing female cadres in large numbers to do all possible work, like organizing women to work in rural areas is the central issue of the current women's movement.\n　　Female comrades who are fighting on the front lines of the East China Field Army! All female comrades who are fighting in the army, in the organs, in the government administrative departments, in rural work, and in various production organizations! Your work has already constituted an important part of the people's liberation cause, and will constitute an even more important part in the future. You attract my deeply moved and inspired heart, longing for the front, longing for you, I extend my cordial greetings and regards to you from afar with enthusiasm and sincerity!

    "content": "U.S. Imperialism Resorts to Despicable Terrorist Tactics in a Futile Attempt to Suppress Democratic Forces in Various Countries\n\nIn Italy, Japan, and the United States, a series of conspiracies to assassinate or arrest prominent Communist leaders have occurred recently. On the 14th, there was a shooting of Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti; on the 19th, Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Tokuda Kyuichi was injured in a bombing; and on the 20th, the U.S. government arrested seven Communist leaders. The Czech government also announced on the 17th that it had uncovered a foreign spy's assassination plot. International democratic public opinion believes that all these conspiracies and terrorist incidents, whether occurring in the United States or other countries, are instigated by U.S. imperialist elements. U.S. Communist leaders Foster and Dennis, in their telegram to the Italian Communist Party, said that the assassination in Rome was the result of American policy, and in their telegram to the Japanese Communist Party, they pointed out that U.S. imperialism was the real instigator of the crime against Tokuda. In addition, according to leaks from American magazines, American reactionaries have a so-called \"Bridge Project\" engaged in espionage in various countries, and its projects include \"assassinating the lives of Communist leaders.\" This heinous conspiracy of the U.S., Italian, and Japanese reactionaries has aroused great indignation among the people of those countries. In particular, the protest against the assassination of Togliatti has turned into a mass movement of worldwide condemnation of the reactionaries.\n\nOther more important international events recently include: (1) The French Schuman government fell on the 19th; French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez called for the establishment of a truly French government at a mass rally in Paris on the 16th; the strike of French government employees has expanded to 1.5 million people on the 13th, and workers from unions affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, \"Workers' Force,\" and the Christian Workers' League have formed a mass united front in the struggle for wage increases. (2) The World Peace Conference organized by the British Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, opened in London on the 17th.

    "content": "Pingshan First District Faces Difficulties in Replanting\n  District and Township Cadres Seek Solutions\n    [Special Dispatch] Our correspondent reports: The first district of Pingshan County, being low-lying with crisscrossing canals, has suffered serious damage from three days of continuous heavy rain. The Yongle Village protective embankment was destroyed by mountain floods. According to preliminary reports, over a thousand mu of land have been flooded. Underground dwelling houses, pigsties, toilets, and weaving cellars have all collapsed. In Sizhuang and Mengbao, the water accumulation in the low-lying areas reaches several feet deep, flooding approximately three hundred mu of crops in the two villages. The seven villages along the Hutuo River in the district have been hit hardest. In Shuinian Village, out of more than 360 households, 874 rooms have collapsed, and 103 households have lost their homes. Over a thousand mu of seedlings have been flooded. According to incomplete statistics from fifteen villages in the district (out of a total of thirty-one), over 3,700 mu of crops have been damaged, including over 700 mu of washed-away beach and upland areas. 3,600 rooms have collapsed, and 370 households have lost their homes. According to experienced farmers, it is estimated that each mu of corn will yield at least six dou less grain (because very little sorghum is planted). Based on this calculation, the fifteen villages will suffer a reduction of around two thousand dan of grain. It is said that corn will die after being submerged in water for three days. If drainage ditches are quickly dug, it may be possible to salvage over a thousand dan of grain (half of which is already beyond saving). The masses in the flooded areas are anxious to drain the water, but struggle to dig ditches without leadership. Military dependents, families of revolutionary martyrs, and disaster victims who have lost their homes are constantly asking village cadres to solve their housing problems. Meanwhile, many upland areas should be quickly sown with buckwheat within two or three days after the rain. Therefore, a series of serious problems are facing the countryside, demanding immediate attention. The lack of buckwheat seeds has become a major issue in replanting. At the Pingshan City market on the 23rd, an old farmer selling buckwheat seeds said that there was only one portion of buckwheat seeds available, costing 200,000 yuan per dou. Many who came to buy buckwheat seeds found it too expensive and returned empty-handed. The village chief of Sizhuang searched for buckwheat for a long time in Lizhuang but couldn't find any, saying, \"I would pay 300,000 yuan if there were buckwheat seeds.\" According to a report from Wangzi Village, the village needs three dan of buckwheat seeds, but can only provide one dan themselves. Mengling Village plans to plant buckwheat on over five qing of drought land needing replanting, requiring ten dan of seeds, but the masses cannot buy them regardless of the price. It is said that planting buckwheat will be too late in three or four days (from July 23rd). Therefore, the masses are very anxious. On the 23rd, the weather cleared up, and villages flocked to the district to ask for solutions and report the disaster situation. However, at this time, only Secretary Hao of the district office and Secretary Zhao of the county government, along with four or five other people, were at home, busy collecting the remaining public grain. Before and after the rain, until the 23rd, the county committee had not given any instructions and even sent a letter requesting that the few cadres remaining in the district be transferred to the county to hear the land reform summary report. Secretary Hao and other comrades then notified the village chiefs and township government chairmen to hold meetings, organize district and village cadres to fully lead the rescue of crops and the resettlement of disaster victims, temporarily suspend collection, and report the disaster situation to the county committee for instructions and request buckwheat seeds. However, due to the lack of prior preparation in the county, the reply was only: \"The county does not have buckwheat seeds.\" \"Let's think of a way now!\" On the morning of July 24th, two members of the district committee returned from the county and immediately organized the existing ten or so cadres from the county, district, and township to go to the villages to lead disaster relief and production. At the village chief joint meeting, they divided into groups to study and arrange the following three urgent tasks: First, dig ditches to drain water. The landowners who benefit from the drainage will compensate the losers with grain. If necessary, the village military land will be used to compensate part of the land in the future. Those who still obstruct mobilization will be forced to comply. Every effort will be made to prevent the loss of a single mu of crops in the flooded areas by mobilizing all manpower to dig ditches and rescue them. Second, smash the entrances to underground tunnels (a major cause of house collapses). Mobilize the entire village to conduct thorough inspections and reinforce them to prevent further house collapses during future rains. Third, resettle disaster-stricken households, especially military dependents and families of revolutionary martyrs, and help them borrow houses to live in. On the morning of the 24th, the work teams went completely to the villages. The village chiefs came along for consultation and then left. On the same day, the East City Street mobilized the masses to smash the tunnel entrances. The water in Mengbao, Sizhuang, Mengling, and other villages receded by several inches or more, and the river water was receding. The reporter inspected Shengfo Village in the afternoon and saw Village Chief Wang Qiuqiu smashing his own tunnel entrance. When asked about the disaster relief situation in his village, he said that the township head came this morning to ask for some figures and then left. The village has not held a meeting to arrange what to do.\n\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Sun Zhen)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平山一区补种有困难　区乡干部正设法解决\n孙震\n1948-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平山一区补种有困难\n  　区乡干部正设法解决\n    【本报特讯】总分社记者报导：平山县一区地势底凹，河渠交错，经三日连绵大雨，现已造成严重灾害。永乐村护村堤被山洪冲毁，据初步报告：淹地千余亩，有地道之房屋及猪圈、厕所、织布窖子，全部塌毁。泗庄、孟堡凹地积雨水深达数尺，两村淹庄稼约三百亩。该区沿滹沱河七个村庄受灾最重，水碾村三百六十多户，塌房八百七十四间，一百零三户失去住所，被水淹毁禾苗达千余亩。现据全区十五个村不完全的统计（全区共三十一个村），淹坏庄稼三千七百余亩，其中被冲毁的滩地、岗地即有七百余亩，房屋倒塌三千六百余间，丧失住所者达三百七十余户。据老农谈：估计毁一亩玉茭少打六大斗粮（因种高梁很少），如此计算，十五个村就要减产两千大石上下。据说玉茭在水里泡三天后就要死了。当前如很快挖沟泄水，则可能抢救一千多大石粮食（有一半已不能抢救）。被水淹地的群众着急泄水，苦于无人领导不易挖沟，无房住的军烈干属、灾民，不断找村干要求解决住处，同时雨后很多岗地两三天后即应赶紧播种荞麦。所以农村里摆着一连串的严重问题，急不可待。在补种中荞麦籽的缺乏成为一大问题，二十三日平山城集，据一买荞麦种老农谈，只有一份荞麦种，一斗要二十万元，不少买荞麦种的都嫌太贵，空袋而回。泗庄村长到里庄找了半天找不到荞麦，他说：“要有荞麦种三十万元我也要。”据王子村报告：该村需要三石荞麦种，本村只能解决一石，孟岭村补种缺苗旱地，准备种荞麦五顷多，需十石籽，群众贵贱买不到手，据说再过三四天（从七月二十三说）种荞麦就晚了。因此群众非常着急。二十三日天气初晴，各村纷纷找区里来要求想办法，报告灾情，可是区里这时只有区公所郝秘书及县政府赵秘书等四五个人在家，正忙于征收公粮尾欠。雨前雨后至二十三日县委尚无任何指示，并来信要将留在区里的几个干部也调到县去听土地改革总结报告，郝秘书等同志遂一面通知村长乡政府主席开会，组织区村干部全力领导抢救庄稼安置灾民，暂时停止征收，一面向县委报告灾情，请示办法，要求荞麦种。但由于县里事前毫无准备，仅答复：“荞麦种县里没有。”“现在想法吧！”七月二十四日上午区委从县里回来两人，立即组织了县、区、乡现有十余干部，下乡领导救灾生产，在村长联席会上，分片研究后布置下列三项紧急工作：一、挖沟泄水，占地由受益户赔他粮食损失，必要时以后由村中军田补给其一部土地，对动员仍阻碍者，强制执行，凡能泄出水的淹地争取不毁一亩庄稼，动员全体人力挖沟抢救。二、砸地道口（这是塌屋的一大原因），动员全村严密检查，砸结实以防再雨时倒房。三、安置灾户，尤其军烈干属，帮助他们借房子住。二十四日午前工作组即完全下乡，各村长随来研究好即随走，当日城东街已动员群众砸地道，孟堡、泗庄、孟岭等村水撤了数寸或尺余，河水已在降落。记者于下午到胜佛村巡视，见村长王秋秋正砸自己的地道口，问到他全村的救灾情况，他说今天早上乡长来要了几个数目字就走了，村里也没开会布置要怎样办。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（孙震）"

    "content": "Masses' Voice\n\n　　By Whose Decree Was I Driven Out?\n　　To the Editor,\n　　I am a poor peasant from Monan Village, Sixth District, Xian County, Jizhong. There is a matter I want to complain about to you. I have a brother, Li Xuewen, who was originally a soldier in the People's Liberation Army. He took leave to return home last year, and after the leave expired, he did not return. This May, the conscription work in our village began. The way of conscription was nominally called \"self-reporting and public discussion,\" but in reality, it was cadres leading everyone to denounce people. My brother, being a soldier who overstayed his leave, naturally became the primary target of conscription. However, my brother's mind was not clear at the time. After hearing that someone had voted for him to return to the army, he became agitated and cursed a few times. Who knew that this cursing would cause a great deal of trouble for our whole family? The village cadres, on one hand, detained my mother and my brother, and on the other hand, ran to the district to discuss, saying, \"If we don't severely strike at his family, the conscription work cannot be done.\" After they discussed this and returned, they paraded my brother through the streets and forced me to join the army as well. I did not accept this approach at the time. The village cadres became angry out of embarrassment, sent my brother to the county People's Court, sealed off our entire house, confiscated all our grain and farm tools, and even announced that the land allocated to us during the land reform would be taken back and given to others. In this way, our whole family was driven out of the village amidst tears and cries.\n　　We reported this matter to the county. Comrade Liu, the county party secretary, instructed the district, \"Let Li Xuewen return to the army and apologize and admit his mistakes to all the villagers.\" I felt that this handling was fair, because naturally one should return to the army if the superiors called for it after one had left the ranks. At the same time, one should apologize and admit one's mistakes if one's mouth was unclean and one cursed others. But who knew that such an instruction from the county party secretary would be ignored by the district? The district committee said, \"It's not worth burning a coat for a louse!\" As a result, our whole family had no choice but to wander around outside, watching helplessly as the land became barren and the farm tools were lost piece by piece, and half of our five or six mu of wheat was harvested by others. Later, Comrade Han, the deputy county party secretary, personally went to the village to resolve this issue, but he also ran into a snag. The village cadres said, \"If we solve it this way, we will all move out of the village and stop working.\" \"This is what the district committee told us to do, we are not responsible, you go and talk to the masses yourself!\" Afterwards, we went to the county party committee several times. The county party committee's attitude was very firm. At the end of June, they wrote a letter to the village cadres saying, \"If the village cadres have any opinions, they can come to the county to discuss them. If they don't implement it any further, they will be punished!\" After receiving the letter, the village cadres ran to the county for a while, spending a lot of time, and finally reluctantly agreed to the county's handling method in words. But what was the actual result? The village cadres became even angrier when they returned from the county. Not only did they not implement the county's instructions, but they also took the confiscated grain of mine and sold it. To this day, the door has not been unsealed. Editor, my brother made a mistake during the conscription, and we are willing to admit our mistake. The county party committee's method of handling this issue is fair, and we sincerely support it. But now we don't understand, the county party committee has decided that our property should not be confiscated, but the district committee and village cadres insist on their own opinions, driving us out of the house, and it has been two or three months now without unsealing the door. Whose decree are they executing after all?\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 把我扫地出门是谁的法令？\n李学忠\n1948-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：群众呼声\n\n　　把我扫地出门是谁的法令？\n    献县陌南村  李学忠编辑同志：\n    我是冀中献县六区陌南村的一个贫农，现在有一件事情要向你们控诉。我有一个兄弟李学文原来在解放军当战士，去年请假回家，以后期满也没回去。今年阳历五月我村扩军工作开始，扩的方式名义上叫作“自报公议”，实际上是干部领头大家检举，我兄弟是逾期不归的战士，当然首先成为扩军的对象。但是我兄弟的脑筋当时没有转开，背后听说有人投票要他归队，于是激动起来骂了几句。谁知道这一骂可不要紧，给我们全家把天大的乱子闯下来了。村干部一方面扣了俺娘和俺兄弟，一方面跑到区里商量说：“不重重的打击他家，扩军工作就做不了。”他们从这里商量好了回来，把我兄弟拉着游街，逼着我也去参军。我当时没有接受这种做法，村干部们羞恼成怒，把我兄弟送到县人民法庭，把我们全家也封了门，所有的粮食农具被没收了，连土改中间分给俺的一份土地也宣布要收回去，另外分给别人。就这样，我们全家哭哭啼啼的被赶出村。\n    这件事情我们曾经告到县上，县委书记刘同志给区里的指示是：“让李学文归队，并向全村群众道歉认错。”我觉得这样处理是公平的，因为从队伍上下来上级叫归队自然要归队，同时嘴不干净骂了人家自然应该道歉认错。但谁知道县委书记的这样一个指示到了区里没人理睬，区委说：“搞不通，不能为一个虱子烧了袄！”结果我们全家没有办法，整天流浪在外，眼巴巴的看着土地荒芜，农具家伙一件件的遗失，五六亩麦子被别人割去一半。后来县委副书记韩同志曾经到村里亲自去解决过这个问题，但是也碰了钉子，村干部说：“要这么解决我们就都搬出村去不干工作了。”“这是区委叫干的，俺们不负责任，你自己去给群众说吧！”以后我们又找过县委几回，县委的态度很坚决，六月底，给村干部写了一封信说：“村干部有意见可到县上来谈，再不执行就受制裁！”村干部接到信到县上跑了一回，费了半天时间，总算口头上勉强答应了县上的处理办法。但是实际结果怎样了呢？村干部从县里回来气更大了，不仅没有执行县上的指示，并且把没收的我的粮食拿去粜了，至今门也不启封。编者同志，在扩军中我兄弟是犯了错误的，我们愿意承认错误。县委在处理这个问题的办法上是公平的，我们诚心拥护。但是现在我们不了解，县委决定了不准没收我们的财产，但是区委和村干部一个劲坚持他们自己的意见，把我们扫地出了门，现在两三个月了也不给启封，他们执行的到底是谁的法令？"

    "content": "International Weekly\n\n　　Sharp Struggle Over Berlin Question, US Imperialist Military Intimidation Bankrupt\n    Recently, a sharp struggle has been waged between the world's democratic forces and anti-democratic forces over the German question, primarily the Berlin question. The American reactionaries vainly attempted to intimidate the Soviet Union with military force. At the same time, the American reactionaries and the reactionaries of other countries they support are using a series of despicable terror tactics in an attempt to overwhelm the democratic forces of various countries.\n    Since the United States, Britain, and France issued new currencies in West Germany and their occupation zones in Berlin, the struggle over the German question has intensified. In order to prevent the new West German currency from flowing into East Germany and the Soviet occupation zone of Berlin and affecting the economic life of the German people in the Soviet occupation zone, the Soviet Union blocked land traffic between the Soviet occupation zone and West Germany. The US government and its British and French partners sent notes to the Soviet Union demanding the lifting of the blockade and instigated their mouthpieces to intimidate the Soviet Union on a large scale. The Associated Press reported on the 12th that Britain had dispatched a large number of troops to West Germany and would reinforce Berlin. However, the Soviet Union's reply on the 14th was extremely firm and tough, pointing out that the current situation in Berlin was the result of the US, British, and French governments violating the four-power decision, and stating that the Soviet Union did not object to negotiations, but the Berlin issue could not be separated from the entire German issue. The Soviet Union's reply gave the unreasonable demands of the United States, Britain, and France a head-on blow. In the face of the Soviet Union's firm attitude, the American reactionaries became anxious and played a series of \"war of nerves\" tricks. On the 16th, the US government officially announced the dispatch of sixty Superfortress bombers (which they called \"atomic bombers\") to Britain; on the 17th, former Director of the US Strategic Services (the US foreign espionage agency) Donovan said: he \"suggested imposing economic sanctions on the Soviet Union and blocking the Panama, Suez, and Kiel Canals, and the Dardanelles Strait\"; on the 18th, United Press reported that the US was initiating \"a plan to send armored trains or armored vehicles to transport food supplies to besieged Berlin\"; on the 19th, US Interior Secretary Krug said that Western countries \"will eventually have a war with the Soviet Union.\" However, none of these measures intimidated the Soviet Union. On the contrary, the Soviet Union strengthened its ground and air inspection and protection measures and allocated 100,000 tons of wheat and an equal amount of other food on the 20th to supply the entire Berlin \"in its own way,\" winning the heartfelt gratitude of the German people. Moreover, the war atmosphere created by the American reactionaries was too tense, which instead alarmed its partners. Originally, Britain was not very active in this incident. The Associated Press report on Britain's troop increase in Berlin was dismissed by three British officials as \"nonsense\" on the same day. According to a United Press report from The Hague on the 20th, when the \"Western European Union\" Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in The Hague, \"on the Berlin issue, British Foreign Secretary Bevin opposed a showdown with the Soviet Union. French Foreign Minister Bidault and the Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg especially opposed any grandiose plan to break the Berlin blockade by force, and they urged the restoration of four-power negotiations by all possible means.\" Under these circumstances, Marshall declared on the 21st that \"the United States will use diplomatic and negotiation methods to achieve a possibly acceptable solution to the Berlin situation,\" revealing the true colors of a \"paper tiger.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 柏林问题尖锐斗争美帝武力恫吓破产\n\n1948-07-30\n第2版()\n专栏：国际一周\n\n　　柏林问题尖锐斗争美帝武力恫吓破产\n    最近时期中，世界民主力量与反民主力量在德国问题首先在柏林问题上进行了尖锐的斗争。美国反动派妄图以武力恫吓苏联。与此同时，美国反动派及其所支持的其他国家的反动派，正在使用一连串的卑鄙的恐怖手段，企图压倒各国的民主力量。\n    自美、英、法在西德及其在柏林占领区发行新货币以来，德国问题的斗争就尖锐了起来。苏联为防止西德新货币流入东德及柏林苏占区，影响苏占区德国人民的经济生活，乃封锁苏占区与西德间的陆上交通。美国政府及其英、法伙伴照会苏联，要求撤消上述封锁，同时策动其喉舌，苏联大肆恫吓。美联社十二日传出英国已派大量军队至西德并将增兵柏林的消息。然而，苏联于十四日复文的立场是极其坚定而强硬，指出柏林现势是美英法政府违反四国决定的结果，又表明苏联并不反对谈判，但不能把柏林问题与整个德国问题分开来谈。苏联的复文予美、英、法的无理要求以当头一喝。在苏联坚定态度的前面，美国反动派着了急，于是就玩了一连串的“神经战”把戏。十六日，美国官方宣布派遣六十架超级空中堡垒（他们把它叫做“原子弹轰炸机”）赴英；十七日，美前战略服务局（美国在外间谍机关）局长杜诺万扬言：他“建议对苏施行经济制裁，并封锁巴拿马、苏彝士、基尔三运河和达达尼尔海峡”；十八日，合众社称，美方发起“派遣装甲火车或装甲汽车运送粮食供应品至被包围之柏林的计划”；十九日，美内长克鲁格说西方国家“终将发生与苏联的战争”。但是，所有这些措施，并没有吓倒苏联，相反，苏联倒是加强了它在地面及空中的检查与保护措施，并于二十日拨发十万吨小麦和同等数量的其他食粮，“按照自己的方法”供应整个柏林，博得了德国人民的衷心感激。而且，美国反动派所制造的战争空气太紧张了，倒反而使得它的伙伴们惶恐起来。本来，在这次事件中，英国就不大积极。美联社关于英国增兵柏林的消息当天就为三位英国官员斥为“无稽”。据合众社海牙二十日电称，当海牙举行“西欧联盟”五国外长会议时，“在柏林问题上，英外相贝文反对与苏联摊牌，法外长比道尔及荷比卢外长，特别反对以武力打通柏林封锁的任何堂皇计划，他们并教促以一切可能的方法恢复四强谈判。”在这种情况下，马歇尔于二十一日宣称“美国将运用外交与谈判的方法使柏林局势获得可能接受之解决”，这就现出了“纸老虎”的原形。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editorial\n\n　　Celebrating the Five-Route Great Victory\n    Amid a series of exciting victories, the People's Liberation Army is marching forward victoriously into the third year of the Liberation War. Our army has won great victories in the Central Plains, North China, and East China battlefields.\n    The Kaifeng and Suiqi victories in Henan, Central Plains, are strategically significant victories for our army in the Central Plains Liberated Area in recent times. These two campaigns lasted a month, eliminating nearly 100,000 enemy troops, briefly liberating Kaifeng, the capital of Henan Province, and capturing alive Chiang Kai-shek's army corps commander Qu Shounian and Shen Chengnian, commander of the reorganized 75th Division.\n    The Xiangfan victory eliminated more than 20,000 enemy troops, captured alive the notorious special agent bandit leader Kang Ze, commander of the 15th Pacification Zone, and deputy commander Guo Xunqi, and controlled the central section of the Han River. This is another brilliant victory for our army in the Central Plains recently.\n    In the Jinzhong area, our North China People's Liberation Army attacked the Taiyuan area. Over the past month, it has annihilated a group army headquarters, five army headquarters, more than nine divisions, and two brigades of Yan Xishan's bandit army, liberating all areas outside Taiyuan, and capturing alive group army commander Zhao Chengshou, 33rd Army commander Shen Rui, and many division commanders. Our army's progress is as swift as autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Now the remnants of Yan's bandits have shrunk to the isolated city of Taiyuan, and the liberation of Shanxi's capital and the complete annihilation of Yan Xishan's bandit army are not far away.\n    In the areas surrounding Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding, another corps of our North China People's Liberation Army and a part of the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol-Liaoning People's Liberation Army have conducted continuous operations for fifty days. First, in the eastern Hebei area, they attacked and occupied Fengrun, destroyed the Pinggu line, captured Changli, and annihilated the 8th and 5th Brigades of the traffic police, totaling 13,000 enemy troops. Then another part of our army fought between Beiping and Baoding, annihilating the Provisional 31st Division, sweeping away the bandit Wang Fenggang's lair, and cutting off the transportation between Beiping and Baoding, isolating Baoding, the capital of Hebei Province.\n    Our East China army, starting from the Changtan campaign, carried out continuous operations on the Jiaoji and Jinpu lines and in northern Jiangsu for more than two months, eliminating over 100,000 enemy troops and liberating eighteen cities. In the battle to capture the strategic location of Yanzhou, Huo Shouyi, commander of Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 12th Army, was captured alive, and the reorganized 84th Division of the traitor Wu Huawen's army was largely annihilated in the Dawenkou battle. Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, has been completely isolated. Xuzhou, one of Chiang Kai-shek's important military bases, has become one of the foremost front-line cities.\n    This series of great victories has undoubtedly dealt another extremely serious blow to the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang, further placing its overall strategy in a passive position and creating more favorable conditions for the People's Liberation Army's future victories on all battlefields.\n    This series of great victories tells us that Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic guidance is completely correct and the only victorious strategic policy. All reactionaries, whether it is Chiang Kai-shek's \"overall offensive\" or \"key offensive,\" or his \"overall defense\" or \"key defense,\" whether it is Fu Zuoyi's \"main force against main force,\" \"penetrating tactics,\" or Bai Chongxi's \"offensive defense,\" are inevitably doomed to failure. After suffering multiple defeats, the Kuomintang reactionaries' last trump card to deal with the People's Liberation Army is to rely on their solid defense zones and fortified cities to protect themselves, believing that the People's Liberation Army could not possibly capture their solid defense zones and cities. However, after the People's Liberation Army seized thousands of enemy cannons in the war, it established a powerful people's artillery force. From then on, the People's Liberation Army is not only invincible in mobile field warfare, but also invincible in positional warfare. Over the past year, we have captured solid defense zones and fortified cities such as Shijiazhuang, Yuncheng, Linfen, Baoji, Weixian, Yanzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xiangyang, Liaoyang, Anshan, and Sipingjie. This shows that the People's Liberation Army's tactics, especially siege tactics, have made significant progress. Therefore, there are no more Kuomintang fortified cities that cannot be opened. This will naturally shock American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang, because their last trump card for self-preservation is also completely useless. However, this new situation only emerged after American imperialism supplied the People's Liberation Army with a large number of cannons. Now, American imperialism is still supplying the Kuomintang reactionaries with guns and cannons in large quantities, showing that it is willing to continue to serve as our army's transportation team.\n    Our army has not only won great victories militarily, but also continued to win great victories politically. That is, the correct policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have been truly implemented consistently from top to bottom in the People's Liberation Army. The excellent discipline and correct policy implementation demonstrated by our army in Kaifeng this time is one example. This shows that the political quality of our army has further improved. Our army has deeply won the hearts of the people and received the sincere support of all anti-American and anti-Chiang people. Chiang's bandits have lost the hearts of the people and are hated by all the people. This is the fundamental reason why Chiang's army is bound to be defeated and our army is bound to win. It is of extreme importance to correctly continue carrying out the new-style military rectification, and to constantly improve the political consciousness of our army's officers and soldiers, rectify discipline, and implement policy education.\n    As the Liberation War enters its third year, north of the Yellow River, the enemy has only a few scattered strongholds besides the PingSui and PingJin railways and the towns on these two lines, such as Shenyang, Changchun, Chengde, Baoding, Taiyuan, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Jiaozuo. In this vast and rich area, the day of completely and thoroughly eliminating the Kuomintang bandit army is not far away. The situation in which the four major liberated areas of Northeast, North China, Northwest, and East China are completely connected will be realized. South of the Yellow River, the strength of the People's Liberation Army has grown greatly in the past year. The Shandong and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Areas have exceeded their pre-war scale; the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, Western Henan, Southern Shaanxi, Tongbai, Jianghan, Northern Jiangsu, and Central Jiangsu Liberated Areas are all developing or recovering; the Jianghuai Military Region has been established, and the Dabie Mountain guerrilla warfare is persisting. The situation on the Central Plains battlefield has long been unfavorable to Chiang Kai-shek.\n    In this battle of Henan, Chiang Kai-shek guaranteed to the puppet Legislative Yuan that Kaifeng would never be lost and personally directed the battle in the skies over Kaifeng. However, Kaifeng was liberated by our army. When Chiang's bandit troops rushed to Kaifeng, before they could catch their breath, our army captured his corps commander alive in the Sui County and Qi County area, captured Yanzhou in the east, and captured Xiangyang in the south. Now, Jinan and Xuzhou are again in critical condition. Two days before Chiang Kai-shek became the puppet president, on April 9th, he made a promise to his group of lackeys, the so-called National Assembly representatives, saying that he would definitely be able to eliminate the Central Plains People's Liberation Army within three to six months. Three months have already passed, and we see that those who have been eliminated are Chiang Kai-shek's beloved special agent bandit leader Kang Ze, his corps commander Qu Shounian, and so on. There are less than three months left until the six months are up, and we will see who eliminates whom.\n    The great victory at the beginning of the third year of the war and its heavy blow to the Kuomintang reactionary rule and American imperialism have led the American imperialists to once again address Chiang Kai-shek, this slave, by name, reprimanding him and threatening to kick him out; they are even willing to risk having Chiang Kai-shek step down and go abroad, allowing other military politicians who pretend to be anti-Chiang, anti-civil war, and anti-dictatorship to carry out a sham peace conspiracy, in order to gain a chance to breathe, reorganize their forces, and make a comeback. But the People's Liberation Army is advancing victoriously, and the Chinese people have realized that without thoroughly overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary rule and driving out the aggressive forces of American imperialism, there will be no real and lasting peace in China. Those who do not truly oppose American imperialism's aggression against China will not truly oppose Chiang, oppose the civil war, or oppose dictatorship, and there will be no true democracy or true peace. Therefore, the conspiracy of American imperialism will still not be able to save the precarious fate of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Now, the Kuomintang reactionaries inside are like a group of pirates on a sinking ship, cursing each other, fighting each other, and desperately grabbing what they think can save their lives. In the Henan campaign, Chiang Kai-shek fabricated so-called \"great victory\" news to his master and subordinates in an attempt to deceive them. Chiang Kai-shek has always talked about the \"joint responsibility system.\" This time in the Henan campaign, Chiang Kai-shek personally directed the battle, losing 100,000 troops, failing to defend Kaifeng, and causing the fall of Yanzhou and Xiangyang. The person directly responsible is Chiang Kai-shek himself, so he can only talk about \"victory\" and can only call the 75th Division, which was completely and thoroughly annihilated, the most meritorious unit. He cannot talk about the \"joint responsibility system.\" Chiang Kai-shek has to adopt such deceptive means towards his master and subordinates, which shows that Chiang Kai-shek's evil rule has reached the brink of final collapse.\n    The People's Liberation Army has unveiled the prelude to the third year of the Liberation War with a great victory. We warmly celebrate these victories and wish for even greater victories in the future. All anti-communist and anti-people reactionary forces are bound to fail, and the people's power is bound to win. Let the American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries know that China will be China of the Chinese people and will never allow any aggressors and reactionaries to hide filth and commit crimes on this land.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 祝五路大捷\n\n1948-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社社论\n\n　　祝五路大捷\n    在一连串兴奋人心的大捷声中，人民解放军迈着雄壮的步伐，胜利地跨进解放战争的第三年。在中原、华北和华东战场上，我军都打了大胜仗。\n    豫东开封、睢杞两次大捷，是最近时期我军在中原解放区内的具有战略意义的大胜利。这两个战役经过一个月，歼灭敌人有生力量近十万人，一度解放河南省会开封，活捉蒋匪兵团司令区寿年及整编七十五师师长沈澄年。\n    襄樊之捷，歼敌两万余人，活捉著名的特务匪首第十五绥靖区司令康泽及副司令郭勋祺，控制了汉水中段。这是中原我军最近又一辉煌的胜利。\n    晋中地区我华北人民解放军进攻太原区，一个多月来，歼灭阎锡山匪军一个集团军司令部、五个军司令部、九个多师、两个总队，解放了太原以外的一切地方，活捉集团军总司令赵承绶、第三十三军军长沈瑞及许多师长，我军进展之速，有如秋风扫落叶。现阎匪残余，已缩守太原孤城，山西省会的解放，与阎锡山匪军的彻底消灭，已经不远了。\n    在平津保周围地区，我华北人民解放军另一兵团与冀察热辽人民解放军一部，五十天来进行了连续的作战，先在冀东地区，袭占丰润，破击平古线，攻克昌黎，歼敌交警第八总队第五总队等部一万三千人，然后我另一部又在北平保定之间作战，歼敌暂编三十一师，扫荡土匪王凤岗的巢穴，切断了北平与保定间的交通，使河北省会保定陷于孤立。\n    华东我军，从昌滩战役起，在胶济津浦两线及在苏北进行了两个多月的连续作战，歼敌十万以上，解放城市十八座。在攻克战略要地兖州之战中，活捉蒋匪整编第十二军军长霍守义，并在大汶口战斗中大部歼灭汉奸吴化文部整编八十四师，山东省会济南城已经完全孤立。蒋匪重要军事基地之一的徐州，则已变为最前线的城市之一。\n    这一连串的大胜利，无疑的，又给了美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党的反动统治以极为严重的打击，使它的全盘战略更加陷于被动，并为人民解放军今后在一切战场上的胜利创造了更有利的条件。\n    这一连串的大胜利，告诉我们：毛泽东同志的战略指导，是完全正确的，是唯一的胜利的战略方针。一切反动派，不论是蒋介石的“全面进攻”或“重点进攻”，也不论是他的“全面防御”或“重点防御”，不论是傅作义的“主力对主力”、“穿心战术”，不论是白崇禧的“攻势防御”，都是不可避免地要失败的。国民党反动派在受到多次的失败之后，赖以对付人民解放军的最后一张王牌，就是依靠他们坚固的设防地带与设防城市以自保，他们以为人民解放军无论如何也不能攻克他们坚固的设防地带和城市。然而，人民解放军在战争中夺取了敌人成千门的大炮之后，就建立了具有强大威力的人民的炮兵，从此，人民解放军不独在运动的野战中是无敌的，就是在阵地战中也是无敌的了。一年来我们攻克了石家庄、运城、临汾、宝鸡、潍县、兖州、洛阳、开封、襄阳、辽阳、鞍山、四平街等坚固的设防地带与设防城市。这就表现了人民解放军的战术，特别是攻坚战术，有了长足的进步。因此，已经没有什么国民党的设防城市打不开的了。这自然要使美国帝国主义及国民党匪帮震惊失色，因为他们最后赖以自保的一张王牌也完全无用了。然而，这只是美国帝国主义及国民党反动派供给了人民解放军大批大炮之后，才出现了这一新的情况的。现在，美帝国主义仍在大批供给国民党反动派以枪炮，可见它是愿意继续担任我军运输队的任务了。\n    我军不仅在军事上打了大胜仗，并且在政治上也继续地打了大胜仗，这就是，中共中央的正确政策，真正在人民解放军中上下一致地贯彻执行了。此次我军在开封所表现的优良纪律与正确的政策实施，就是一个例子。这说明了我军政治质量有更进一步的提高。我军深得民心，受到一切反美反蒋人民的衷心拥护，蒋匪失了民心，受到所有人民的痛恨，这是蒋军必败我军必胜的根本原因。正确地继续进行新式整军，时刻不懈地提高我军将士的政治觉悟，整饬纪律，贯彻政策教育，是有极重要意义的工作。\n    解放战争进入第三年的时候，敌人在黄河以北，除了平绥、平锦两条铁路及在这两条路上的城镇外，只有沈阳、长春、承德、保定、太原、安阳、新乡、焦作等稀稀落落的几个据点了。在这个广大而富庶的地区内，干净彻底全部消灭国民党匪军的日子，已经不远。东北、华北、西北、华东四个大解放区之间完全打成一片的局面，将要实现了。黄河以南，人民解放军的力量一年来有很大的生长。山东和陕甘宁解放区超过了战前的规模；豫皖苏、豫西、陕南、桐柏、江汉、苏北、苏中各解放区都在发展或恢复之中；江淮军区已经建立，大别山游击战争正在坚持。中原战场上的形势，早已不利于蒋介石了。\n    此次豫东大战，蒋介石对伪立法院保证开封决不会丢，亲自到开封上空指挥作战，然而开封竟被我军解放。蒋匪军队赶到开封，喘息未定，我军又在睢县杞县地区活捉他的兵团司令，在东边打下兖州，在南边打下襄阳，现在，济南与徐州又在告急。蒋介石充当伪总统的前两天即四月九日，曾经对他的一群猪仔所谓国大代表发出诺言，说他一定可以在三个月到六个月的时间内肃清中原人民解放军。三个月早已过去了，我们看见被肃清的是蒋介石所宠爱的特务匪首康泽，是他的兵团司令区寿年等等。还有不到三个月的时间就要满六个月，我们倒要看一看究竟谁肃清谁。\n    战争第三年开始时的巨大胜利及其对于国民党反动统治与美国帝国主义的沉重打击，使美国帝国主义者，对于蒋介石这个奴才，再次直呼其名，加以呵斥，并威吓着要他滚蛋；甚至不惜冒险地准备要蒋介石下野出洋，让其他伪装反蒋反内战反独裁的军人政客，来进行假和平的阴谋，以图能取得喘息机会，重整兵力，卷土重来。但人民解放军正在胜利前进，中国人民已经觉悟到不彻底推翻国民党反动统治，不赶走美帝国主义的侵略势力，中国是没有真正的永久的和平可言的。凡不真正反对美帝国主义侵略中国的，就不会真正反蒋，反内战反独裁，也不会有真民主，真和平。故美帝国主义的阴谋，仍将不能挽救国民党反动统治垂危的命运。现在国民党反动派内部，好象一群海盗，在将要沉没的破船上，互相咒骂，互相厮打，穷凶极恶地抢夺他们认为可以救命的东西。豫东之战，蒋介石对他的主子和部下，伪造所谓“大捷”的消息，以图欺骗。蒋介石是向来讲什么“连坐法”的，这次豫东作战，蒋介石亲自指挥，丧师十万，开封不保，并使兖州襄阳失陷，直接负责者就是蒋介石自己，所以他只能讲“胜利”，只能把被全部干净彻底歼灭的七十五师，称为最有功劳的部队，不能讲“连坐法”了。蒋介石对其主子和部下，不能不采取这样的欺骗手段，这就表示，蒋介石的万恶统治，已经到了最后崩溃的边沿了。\n    人民解放军以伟大的胜利，揭开了解放战争第三年的序幕。我们热烈庆祝这些胜利，并预祝今后更大的胜利。一切反共反人民的反动势力必定失败，人民的力量必定胜利。让美国帝国主义者和国民党反动派知道，中国将是中国人民的中国，将永远不允许任何侵略者与反动派在这块土地上藏垢纳污，为非作歹。"

    "content": "US Democratic Party Presidential Election\n  　Truman Nominated Reluctantly\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] Reports from various sources: The Democratic Party, another major bourgeois party in the United States, following the Republican Party convention last month, convened a representative assembly in Philadelphia on the 12th of this month to formulate the party's election platform for this year and to nominate candidates for president and vice president. On the 14th, the conference adopted a reactionary platform basically identical to that of the Republican Party, advocating so-called regional collective defense and the abolition of the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter, boasting of its notorious Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, and maintaining a strong military force. In order to win the votes of blacks and laborers, the party platform listed deceptive promises of so-called civil rights clauses and the abolition of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, promises that stand in ironic contrast to the current ruling Democratic government's anti-communist, anti-labor, and anti-civil rights behavior. Sharp struggles occurred at the conference over the issue of nominating presidential candidates. Some groups within the party that originally supported Truman, such as the Americans for Democratic Action and Senator Pepper, turned against Truman before the conference and, together with reactionary Southern Democrats, demanded that Truman withdraw from the election and nominate the non-partisan Eisenhower as the party's presidential candidate in an attempt to salvage the Democratic Party's decline. However, this activity failed because Eisenhower refused to run as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate on July 6. In a situation where \"everyone is unwilling to elect Truman\" but also \"cannot find anyone who can compete with him\" (Associated Press), the conference passed the nominations of Truman and Kentucky Senator Barkley as the party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates for this year on the evening of the 14th and the morning of the 15th. The conference closed on the 15th. However, a portion of Southern Democrats representing the interests of slave-owning landowners, due to conflicts with Truman over the so-called civil rights platform, withdrew from the conference on the 14th and held a Southern Democratic conference in Birmingham, Alabama, on the 17th, putting forward separate presidential and vice-presidential candidates. A serious split has formed among the Democratic reactionaries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美民主党竞选总统　勉强提名杜鲁门\n\n1948-07-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美民主党竞选总统\n  　勉强提名杜鲁门\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方报导：美国另一个大资产阶级政党——民主党，继上月共和党大会之后，于本月十二日在费城召开代表大会，以制定该党今年的竞选政纲及提出正副总统候选人。大会于十四日通过与共和党基本上相同的反动政纲，即主张所谓区域联防与废除联合国宪章中所规定的否决权，吹嘘其臭名远扬的杜鲁门主义与马歇尔计划，以及维持强大的兵力。为了争取黑人与劳工的选票，该党政纲列举了所谓民权条款及废除塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法的欺骗诺言，这一诺言与目前执政的民主党政府的反共、反劳工、反民权的行为，适成富于讽刺的对照。大会在提出总统候选人问题上，曾发生了激烈的斗争。党内原来拥护杜鲁门的某些集团，如美国民主行动社及参议员泼贝尔等，于会前转而反对杜鲁门，并与反动的南方民主党人共同要求杜鲁门退出竞选，另提无党派的艾森豪威尔为该党总统候选人，以图挽救民主党的颓势。但是，他们这一活动因艾氏在七月六日拒绝出任民主党总统候选人而落空。大会在“大家不情愿选杜鲁门”、但也“找不出一个能和他对抗的人”（合众社）的局势下，于十四日晚及十五日晨先后通过提名杜鲁门与肯特基州参议员巴克莱为该党今年的正副总统候选人。大会于十五日闭幕。但代表蓄奴大地主利益的一部分南方民主党人，因在所谓民权政纲上与杜鲁门发生矛盾，于十四日退出大会并于十七日在阿拉巴马州之北明翰城举行南方民主党会议，提出了另外的正副总统候选人。民主党反动派之间，已形成了严重的分裂。"

Various locations are seizing the opportunity to rush-plant and replant late seedlings to make up for the losses caused by the drought. Cadres in Yuanchao First District went to villages to call for rush-planting even before the rain stopped. Party members and village cadres in Tumentou and two other villages took the lead in a day and a half of intensive work, rush-planting 498 mu of sweet potatoes, corn, late millet, and replanting mung beans. All the unplanted land in the villages has been sown. Party members in Zhao Jiahe Village called on men and women to work together in the rain to plant sweet potatoes, planting 217 mu of sweet potatoes and corn in a day and a half, completing the planting of all unplanted land and now moving on to weeding and thinning. The Dishang sub-district of the Sixth District, having plowed the wheat stubble fields before the rain, immediately began sowing after the rain. In Huazhuang in the Seventh District, those with livestock and those without voluntarily helped each other to rush-plant and replant. Yang Liu, a widow, watched melons for others, guarding the melon vines and looking after chicks, in exchange for others rush-planting five and a half mu of late seedlings for her. Huang Chaoliang, who had no livestock, cooperated with Huang Chaoying, who did, using grass cutting and weeding to pay for the use of the ox. The whole village finished planting the wheat stubble fields in two days, totaling 1,181 mu of sweet potatoes, corn, and radishes. During the rush-planting, most villages found a shortage of farm implements, especially rollers. In the Sixth District and Baifenggu Village in the Fifth District, small carts were used as substitutes. After the rain, a total of 239,891 mu of late seedlings were rush-planted. Wu'yi County rush-planted late seedlings after the rain and also planted alfalfa to increase the fodder for cattle. After the widespread soaking rains on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, the First, Second, and Fourth District Committees immediately instructed the counties by telephone to seize the opportunity to rush-plant.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 雨未停就作准备抓紧时机不拖延　冀南元朝雨后全力抢种\n\n1948-07-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　雨未停就作准备抓紧时机不拖延\n  　冀南元朝雨后全力抢种\n    【冀南电】冀南区于七月十一、十二两日获喜雨，面积约占全区五分之二。十九日至二十一日，又连续阴雨三天，除三分区情况不明外，全境均已落透。各地正抓紧时机，抢种补种晚苗，补救旱灾的损失。元朝一区干部在阴雨未停时，即分头到村号召抢种。土门头等三村党员村干带头突击一天半，抢栽红薯、玉米、晚谷、补种绿豆共四百九十八亩，全村所有白茬地已全部播种。赵夹河村党员在雨中号召男女一齐动手栽种红薯，一天半栽种红薯、玉米二百一十七亩，白茬地全部种完，现已转入锄草间苗。六区堤上小区因雨前抓紧了犁麦茬地，雨后随即下种。七区化庄有牲口的和无牲口的自愿互助，抓紧抢种补种。孤寡杨刘氏给别人看瓜、押瓜秧、看小鸡、换取别人给抢种上五亩半晚苗。黄朝良没牲口，和有牲口的黄朝营互助，以割草和锄地还牛工。全村两天种完麦茬地，共计红薯、玉米、萝卜一千一百八十一亩。抢种中多数村庄发现农具缺乏，特别是砘子少。六区及五区白封固等村用小车轧来代替。雨后共抢种晚苗二十三万九千八百九十一亩。武邑县于雨后抢种晚苗，并栽种苜蓿，以增加耕牛饲料。十九日、二十日、二十一日三天普落透雨后，一、二、四等地委即以电话指示各县抓紧突击抢种。"

Comrade Li Jirong, the squad leader of the second squad of the fifth company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, was leading a grenade throwing team, searching forward along the main street when he suddenly noticed a dark figure ahead. He asked, \"Which unit are you from?\" The dark figure remained still and asked in return, \"Which unit are you from?\" \"One-zero-nine.\" The fellow vaguely heard \"Two-one-nine\" and mistakenly thought they were his own people, replying, \"I am also from the 'Two-one-nine' unit.\" Squad Leader Li knew he had misheard, so he ordered him to come over, clapping his hands. When he approached, Comrade Zhang Wenqing saw that he was wearing a hat with a red circle and secretly told the squad leader, \"It's the enemy!\" Squad Leader Li quickly signaled him not to shoot, and at the same time, noticing that he was carrying a backpack, knew that he was trying to escape. Squad Leader Li immediately devised a plan, pretending to say to him, \"Are there any more people? Go back and make contact. We are all on the same side and should leave together.\" The enemy completely believed him. \"Okay! I'll go back and make contact. Don't misunderstand, we are on the same side!\" He turned around and went back. Squad Leader Li and the others followed closely behind, watching him enter a gate. They ambushed themselves on both sides of the gate, and the others in the squad rushed up and hid behind the wheat stack opposite the gate. After a short pause, the enemy suddenly came out. Squad Leader Li and the others used bayonets to force them to surrender. However, the enemy was still dreaming, complaining, \"Giving my gun to my own people, what will happen if I encounter the enemy?\" \"Hurry up and surrender your gun! They are the enemy over there.\" As he said this, they dragged them one by one to the back. The enemy inside, still in groups of three or five, continued to pour out. As soon as they reached the gate, Squad Leader Li unexpectedly snatched their weapons, grabbed their necks, and dragged them behind the wheat stack. In this way, they captured forty or fifty people silently without the enemy noticing. Later, when more than a dozen enemies came out, they realized that there was an ambush at the gate, but those in front had already rushed to the gate, still confused and self-persuading, \"What time is it? You haven't given your gun to them yet.\" They also automatically surrendered their guns. Those in the back saw that something was wrong and ran back. Squad Leader Li, holding the machine gun he had just seized, chased into the courtyard and eliminated more than a dozen fellows who were trying to escape. At this time, comrades from one platoon all squeezed into the courtyard. Squad Leader Li and the others handed over the prisoners to them, took them to the back, and then led the comrades of the second squad into the house. They saw that there were still more than twenty enemies sleeping soundly. Everyone guarded the door and shouted, \"Wake up! Others have already surrendered, and you are still sleeping. Get up!\" A room full of enemies, without saying a word, were taken prisoner in a daze.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一个哑叭仗\n\n1948-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一个哑叭仗\n  　晋中前线通讯\n    七月十二日夜两点钟，总攻太谷大常镇阎匪赵承绶部的战斗中，天下着小雨，阴得黑洞洞的。人民解放军某部五连二班长李集荣同志，带着投弹组，正顺着大街向前搜索，突然发现前面有个黑影，便问道“那一部分？”对面的黑影不动了，反问“你是那一部分？”“一零九。”这家伙模模糊糊的听象“二一九”，竟以为是自己人，又答道：“我也是‘二一九’部”，李班长知道他听错了，就命他拍着手过来，走到身边时，张文庆同志看见他戴着红圈帽子，就偷偷的告诉班长说：“是敌人！”李班长忙示意他不要打，同时，发现他背着背包，知道他是想要逃跑。李班长马上计上心来，故意对他说：“还有什么人，回去联络一下，咱们都是自己人，要走一块走。”敌人竟完全相信。“好！我回去联络去，自己人可不要误会呀！”说着，转身就回去了。李班长等，紧跟在后面，看他进了一个大门，他们几个就埋伏在大门两侧，班里的其他人忙赶上来，藏在大门对面的麦垛后面，稍停，忽然敌人从里面出来，李班长等就用刺刀逼住缴枪。可是，敌人还在做梦一样，埋怨着说：“自己人枪缴给你，碰见敌人看怎么办？”“赶快缴枪吧！那里是敌人。”说着，一个个都拖到后面去了。里面的敌人，还是三五成群的向外涌，一到门口，李班长就冷不防的夺过敌人武器，抓着脖子，拖到麦垛后面，这样不声不响的接连捉了四五十个，敌人都没发觉。后来，又出来十几个敌人时，才知道门口埋伏有人，但前面的已经闯到大门跟前，还迷迷糊糊的自行劝告的说：“到什么时候了，枪还不给人家。”也自动缴了枪，后面看了不对头，就朝回跑。李班长端着刚缴来的机枪，追到院子里，又把十几个想逃跑的家伙解决了。这时，一排同志都挤进院子来了。李班长等把俘虏交给他们，往后面带走后，又带着二班同志，冲进房子里一看，还有二十多个敌人在睡大觉呢。大家把住门，就大呼起来：“醒醒吧！人家都缴了枪，你们还睡觉哩。起来！”一屋子敌人，连话都没说，糊里糊涂的都作了俘虏。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-07-31",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【Taihang News】After more than a month of rectifying mutual aid since mid-June, Xiawen Village in She County has gained preliminary experience. Since the Great Production Movement in 1944, each street in the village has had mutual aid groups and labor exchange teams. Each street also has a production team leader to uniformly lead the entire street. The village has a production director who uniformly leads the entire village. On the surface, the mutual aid organization and production leadership seem complete and sound, but after careful inspection, it was found that most of them were organized under administrative orders in pursuit of form, which violated the voluntary, equal, and democratic mutual aid policy. This time, under the leadership of the work team in the village, rectification was carried out in accordance with the principles of voluntarism, equality, and democracy.\n\nDuring the rectification, the work team paid attention to studying the demands of the masses, resolutely changed the complex and troublesome organizational forms that were difficult for the masses to accept in the past, as well as the commanding style of forcing the masses to accept such forms, and criticized the erroneous understanding of some comrades who believed that mutual aid based on kinship was feudal relations. In this way, the masses were truly relied upon for their voluntarism and needs, and they were led to carry out rectification. As a result, the majority of the masses voluntarily joined or withdrew based on the original groups, and thus various forms of mutual aid appeared: there were regular agricultural mutual aid groups; there were temporary mutual aid groups of several people combined for labor exchange; some were combined with certain people during wheat harvesting, and then combined with other people for tobacco and indigo planting in temporary mobile labor exchanges; there were a few more advanced mutual aid groups combining agriculture and sideline occupations, these groups worked the hardest, saving labor in all aspects, squeezing out surplus labor, and collectively renting and planting tobacco and indigo, pressing oil, milling flour, contracting work, etc., so the labor efficiency was the highest, the labor achievements were the greatest, and the masses also felt that \"others have methods, they can make money.\" Some were combined with livestock as the center, mostly poor and newly emerging middle peasants, but also some old middle peasants. Some were a combination of households with labor and livestock, mainly old and newly emerging middle peasants, but also some poor peasants. From the perspective of mutual aid relations, most of the above various forms were formed on the basis of kinship and friendship. Some of them have been exchanging labor since before the War of Resistance against Japan. Under the production mutual aid policy of \"organizing\" by our party after the war, they have consciously made many improvements and enhancements. Now they also have democratic discussions, arrange life, generally implement equal exchange, have elected team leaders, and are no longer the more primitive mutual aid forms of each minding their own business. The work team and the masses treated the above various forms with the principle that all those organized on the basis of voluntarism and equality, which are conducive to everyone's joint production, are considered good. At the same time, special respect was given to the spontaneous small-scale temporary labor exchange mutual aid organizations of the masses.\n\nRegarding the issues of labor scoring and conversion, equal exchange, and rational organization of labor, judging from the twelve mutual aid groups and labor exchange teams in Xiawen Village, the vast majority of the masses demanded labor mutual aid, labor exchange for labor, and labor repayment for labor; wage exchange was to facilitate the exchange and settlement of labor. Therefore, the masses paid special attention to the scoring of labor. In this regard, in the past, they were afraid of trouble, talked about generosity, did not pay attention to precise calculation, and generally stipulated that male laborers would be worth ten points, and half laborers would be worth five points, which resulted in those with strong labor and good skills suffering losses, reduced labor efficiency, and made it difficult for mutual aid groups to last. However, the conversion methods stipulated by individual groups were too complex and detailed, and the masses disliked the trouble, so they could not last. In general, the masses' demand for conversion is both fair and simple. In terms of labor accounting, the masses also demanded flexibility and rationality; for example, when pulling seedlings, the morning was counted as three \"xiangs\" (a unit of time), and the afternoon was counted as two \"xiangs\"; when harvesting wheat, in order to squeeze time to thresh in the morning, some groups changed it to one \"xiang\" in the early morning, two \"xiangs\" in the morning, two \"xiangs\" in the afternoon, and threshing wheat at noon. In terms of democratic leadership and arrangement of life and labor, Zhao Dahuan's group: Li Xiaosan brought two laborers from his family, pulled small seedlings in his own field in the morning, and everyone helped him plant indigo in the afternoon. Li Hanggeng threshed his own grain in the morning and helped plant indigo in the afternoon. The village chief also helped plant indigo in the afternoon after finishing his official business in the morning. Team leaders, Lai Suo, Lan Geng and others, brought the team leader's donkey, the village chief's donkey, Lai Suo's donkey, Lan Geng's donkey, and Xiao San's ox, pulled three plows together, helped plow the land in the morning, and helped Xiao San plant indigo in the afternoon. Such an arrangement of labor and life allowed individuals' small plots of land and scattered work to be completed on time, without delaying collective indigo planting. It was both labor-saving, convenient, and fast, and everyone was satisfied. This kind of practice of combining unified leadership, decentralization, and collective activities according to terrain, labor, living conditions, etc., is the best. Blindly thinking that the more collective activities the better, using many laborers in a small plot of land, wasting labor and not doing a good job of living, is what the masses oppose most. After the rectification, a small number of people did not participate in the mutual aid group; some had already joined the group but then withdrew. They were willing to occasionally exchange labor, feeling that it was easier this way, and that regular mutual aid was too heavy and they couldn't bear it (most of these people were weak in labor); there were also a few households with labor and livestock who were afraid of suffering losses in mutual aid; and there were also some orphans without labor and people who were too selfish and self-interested that everyone was unwilling to accept. The work team followed the principle of voluntarism for these people and allowed them to find their own production methods. The work team believes that in the future, with the correct mutual aid policy and the gradual combination of sideline occupations, those who are afraid of suffering losses and those who are weak in labor may gradually voluntarily join the mutual aid with conditions.\n\nThe work team experienced in this period of work that the important issue in rectifying mutual aid in the old liberated areas is to earnestly understand the demands of the masses and grasp the mutual aid policy of voluntarism, equality, and democracy. If one blindly overestimates the organizational foundation of the old liberated areas and attempts to fully establish mutual aid groups all at once, one will inevitably repeat the mistake of coercive orders, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and harming the production enthusiasm of the masses. But it is not to abandon leadership and let it flow freely, but to be good at promoting the benefits of mutual aid in the past in the old liberated areas, and to carry out rectification and even improve mutual aid groups through the farmers' own experience, retaining the good and removing unreasonable methods and rules.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 下温村整顿互助获经验　取消强迫命令也不放弃领导不拘形式按自愿需要相结合\n\n1948-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　下温村整顿互助获经验\n  　取消强迫命令也不放弃领导不拘形式按自愿需要相结合\n    【太行讯】涉县下温村经过六月中旬以来一月多的整顿互助，已取得初步经验。该村自一九四四年大生产运动以来，各街均有互助组变工队的组织。每街并设有生产大组长，统一领导全街。村内有生产主任，统一领导全村。表面看来，互助组织与生产领导很完整健全，但经细密检查，发现大部分是在追求形式下用行政命令组织的，是违反自愿等价民主的互助政策的。此次在该村工作组领导下，按照自愿、等价、民主的原则进行了整顿。\n    整顿中，工作组注意研究群众要求，坚决改变过去为群众所难于接受的复杂麻烦的组织形式，以及强迫群众接受这种形式的命令作风，并批判了某些同志认为以亲朋关系为基础的互助就是封建关系的错误认识。这样真正依照了群众的自愿与需要，领导群众来进行整顿。结果，群众大多数以原组为基础，纷纷自愿加入或退出，这样互助出现了多种形式：有经常的农业互助组；有临时几个人结合变工的互助组；有的是在割麦时与某些人结合，栽烟栽蓝时又和其他人结合的临时流动变工的互助组；有少数农副业结合的较高级的互助组，这类组起早搭黑干得最有劲，从各方面省工，挤出剩余劳力，集体租栽烟、栽蓝、榨油、磨面、包工做活等，所以劳动效率最高，劳动成绩最大，群众也觉得“人家有办法，能赚钱”。有以牲口为中心结合的，这以贫雇与新中农为多，也有部分老中农。有的是有劳力牲口户互相结合，这以老中农及新中农为主，也有部分贫雇农。从互助关系上看，上述各种形式，大部是以亲戚朋友关系为基础组成的。其中还有从抗战前就变工一直变到现在的。这些组在战后我党“组织起来”的生产互助政策下，已自觉的有了很多改进与提高，现在也民主讨论，安排生活，一般的执行了等价交换，有选举的组长，已经不是各顾各的较原始的互助形式了。工作组和群众对待上述各种形式的方针，是凡按自愿等价组织的，有利大家共同生产的，就都认为是好的。同时特别尊重了群众自发的小型的临时变工性的互助组织。\n    关于计工折工、等价交换、合理组织劳力等问题，从下温村十二个互助组、变工队来看，群众绝大部分要求劳力互助，工变工，工还工；工资交换是为便利劳力的交换与结算。因此群众对劳力的评分特别注意。在这方面，过去怕麻烦，讲涵厚，不注意精确计算，笼统的规定男劳力一律顶十分，半劳力顶五分，结果使劳力强、技术好的人吃亏，降低了劳动效率，互助组也难于持久。但有个别组规定的折工办法又太复杂细致，群众都嫌麻烦，结果也不能持久。总的说，群众对折工的要求是既公道，又简便。计工方面，群众也要求灵活又合理；例如拔苗是上午算三晌，下午算二晌；割麦时为要上午挤时间打场，有些组便改为早上一晌，上午二晌，下午二晌，正午碾麦。在民主领导与按排生活劳力上，赵大换组是：李小三带家内两个劳力，上午拔自己地里小苗，下午大家给他互助栽蓝。李恒庚上午自己打场，下午互助种蓝。村长上午办完公，下午也互助种蓝。组长、来锁、兰庚等三人，带上组长驴、村长驴、来锁驴、兰庚驴、和小三牛，合拉三张犁，上午互助突击犁地，下午互助给小三栽蓝。这样的安排劳力与生活，使个人的小块地和零星活均可按时做完，而又不误集体栽蓝。既省工，又方便，又轮的快，大家都满意。这种按照地形、劳力、生活等条件，统一领导，分散与集体活动相结合的做法是最好的。盲目地以为越集体活动越好，一块小地内用上许多劳力，既浪费了劳力，又做不好生活，是群众最反对的。整顿后，有少部分人未参加互助组；有的是已经参加了组而又退出的。他们愿意偶尔变工，觉着这样轻松些，嫌经常互助生活重，受不了（这些人大部是劳力弱）；还有少数是有劳力牲口的户，怕互助起来吃亏；还有一些是无劳力的孤寡和大家不愿要的太自私自利的人。工作组对这些人，均本自愿原则，听其自找生产方式。工作组认为今后在端正互助政策和逐渐结合副业的情况下，怕吃亏的，劳力弱的，都可能有条件的逐渐自愿加入互助。\n    工作组在这段工作中体验到，在老区整顿互助的重要问题，是要认真体会群众的要求，掌握自愿等价民主的互助政策。如果盲目的过高估计老区的组织基础，企图一来就全面地把互助组搞起来，必然重复强迫命令的错误，引起群众不满，损害群众的生产情绪。但也不是放弃领导，任其自流，而是要善于发扬老区过去互助的好处，通过农民自身经验，保留好的，去掉不合理的办法规矩，来进行整顿以至提高互助组。"

On the battlefield, the People's Liberation Army saw enemy soldiers' corpses with ropes tied to their backs. These soldiers were probably unable to withstand the PLA's artillery fire and were \"court-martialed\" by Yan's \"iron-blooded core troops.\" But what use was that? Soldiers (and even many field-grade officers) still surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in large numbers. Wang Linxiang himself died, arms outstretched, in the rubble of Dachangzhen. This proves that if you don't surrender, you only face death. Wang Linxiang could only guarantee that he himself faithfully executed Duan's order. The soldiers were not willing to walk the path to death. Moreover, when they were liberated, they would turn their guns and fire at those who had oppressed them. A soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army personally witnessed a Yan army soldier, after being liberated by us in Xifan Village, immediately ask us for a rifle and shoot down more than a dozen of his commanders who were still resisting. This soldier said that these guys had beheaded many soldiers, and they deserved revenge even in death. Originally, after Xifan Village was surrounded by us, soldiers complained about not having enough to eat, and they were labeled as \"fake elements\" by the officers and \"beheaded and displayed to the public.\"\n　　Yan Xishan's most severe bloody rule cannot save him from death.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Delhi, 9th: Indian newspapers publish details of the Malayan people's uprising. The core of the insurgents is composed of the Malayan People's Army guerrillas, who formerly fought against the Japanese aggressors for the freedom of Malaya. The Hindustan Times writes that the causes of the uprising include: corruption of the administrative authorities, shortage of consumer goods, persecution of workers who participated in the anti-Japanese movement during the war, etc. The \"government reform\" implemented in February 1948 restored the rights of the feudal princes, which was opposed by Chinese and Malayan merchants, and this opposition was supported by democratic parties and democratic groups. Low wages (especially in industry and mining) and high living expenses have further deteriorated the political situation in Malaya. The political influence of the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions in Malaya has been increasing. Despite the police ban, mass demonstrations were held in Singapore on May 1, and the people's uprising began in mid-May. \"The Statesman\" reported on July 8 that the Malayan authorities are brutally suppressing the people's uprising. The Pakistan Times reported that the British Navy and Air Force are also fighting against the rebels. In the past three weeks, more than a thousand people have been arrested.\n　　\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, London, 9th: The British Communist Party's organ, the \"Daily Worker,\" strongly condemned MacDonald, the British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia, for threatening participants in the Malayan liberation movement in a broadcast. The \"Daily Worker\" wrote that MacDonald and the rubber planters he represents are calling their political enemies—all those who criticize the dictatorship and colonial regime, all those who organize themselves in trade unions and dare to strike for higher wages—\"terrorists.\" The Malayan people are fighting for democracy, trade union rights, and a decent standard of living. It is the Malayan rubber planters who are turning Malaya into a police state and implementing a reign of terror.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Moscow, 17th: News reports commenting on the situation in Malaya stated that a broad people's movement is developing in Malaya, and the myth spread by the British press about \"foreign communists\" is only used to divert people's attention from the exploitation of the colonial regime. The cause of the people's uprising should be found in the British colonial policy, which has squeezed the Malayan residents into poverty, without legal protection, and into slave labor in rubber plantations and tin mines. During the Japanese occupation, the British nonchalantly promised the Malayan people autonomy; but countless promises have so far been empty talk. What is worse is that British monopoly capitalists, faced with the American war situation, are further suppressing the wages of the already miserable Malayan workers, thereby sacrificing the interests of the Malayan working people to make up for the loss of their profits. The actions of the British authorities have once again convinced the colonial people that the situation of poverty and lack of rights cannot be eliminated without a struggle for national independence. This struggle is part of the democratic countries' movement for peace and international security, while the unlimited greed of capitalist monopoly giants is threatening peace and international security.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不顾英帝及其走狗凶残镇压　马来亚人民运动益发展\n\n1948-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　不顾英帝及其走狗凶残镇压\n  　马来亚人民运动益发展\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社德里九日讯：印度报纸刊载马来亚人民起义的详情。起义者的核心，是由昔日为争取马来亚自由而抗击日本侵略者的马来亚人民军游击队所组成。印度斯坦时报写道，起义的原因包括：行政当局的腐化、消费品的奇缺、对战争时期参加抗日运动的工人之迫害等等。一九四八年二月所施行的“政府改革”，又恢复了封建王公的权利，这种改革为华籍及马来亚籍商人所反对，这种反对得到民主政党及民主团体的支持。工资低微（特别是在工矿业中）而生活费用高涨，使马来亚的政治情势更趋恶化。新加坡工会联合会在马来亚的政治影响已日益增大。尽管警察加以禁止，群众示威仍于五月一日在新加坡举行，而人民起义则在五月中旬开始。“政治家”报于七月八日报导称：马来亚当局正在凶残地镇压人民起义。巴基斯坦时报载称，英海军及空军也在对反抗者作战。过去三星期内，已有千余人被捕。\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社伦敦九日讯：英共机关报“工人日报”，用最强烈的言词痛斥英驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳，他在广播中对马来亚解放运动的参加者施行威吓。“工人日报”写道，麦克唐纳及其所代表的树胶园主，正在称他们的政敌——所有批评独裁及殖民地政权的人，所有在工会中组织自己并敢于为争取较高工资而罢工的人——为“恐怖主义者”。马来亚人民正在为争取民主及工会权利以及适当的生活水准而斗争。把马来亚变成警察国家，并实施恐怖统治的，正是马来亚的树胶园主。\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：消息报评论马来亚的局势称：广大人民运动正在马来亚发展中，而英国报界所散布的关于“外国共产党分子”的神话，只是用以转移人民对于殖民政权剥削的注意。人民起义的原因，应在英国殖民政策中去寻找，这种政策已将马来亚居民压榨到穷苦不堪，没有法律保障以及在树胶园和锡矿中作奴隶劳动的地步。日军占领期间英国曾满不在乎地答应给马来亚人民以自治；但无数次的诺言至今只是纸上空谈。更甚于此的是：英国垄断资本家在面临着美国战争的情况下，正更进一步抑灭已经如此悲惨的马来亚工人的工资，借此牺牲马来亚劳苦人民的利益，以弥补其利润的损失。英国当局的行动，已再一次使殖民地人民深信：穷困与无权利的景况，若不经过为争取民族独立的斗争。是不能消除的。这种斗争乃是民主国家争取和平及国际安全运动的一部分，而资本主义垄断巨头的无限贪欲，正在威胁着和平及国际安全。"

The congress was attended by 3,000 delegates from various states of the United States, and together with guests from all walks of life, the opening meeting was attended by more than 10,000 people. The congress was held in the same venue where the Republican and Democratic parties held their congresses not long ago. Despite the fact that the reactionary press and radio had copied Hitler's old tricks, launching a \"red scare\" campaign to slander the new party, the enthusiastic atmosphere in the venue was completely different from the previous congresses of the Democratic and Republican parties. Every seat in the delegate section was filled. The first day of the congress was devoted to listening to speeches by the main leaders of the new party movement, and their speeches were often interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience. Wallace, a candidate for chairman of the national committee, and former Minnesota Governor Benson declared in their speeches that the new party would stop the rule of the two parties, which had become servants of the wealthy, and return the government to the people. Baldwin, the director of Wallace's campaign, campaigned for the success of the new party movement in his speech. Baldwin said that there were already various organizations belonging to the new party in all states of the United States. The new party can run in at least 44 states. Baldwin finally suggested that the new party be named the Progressive Party. The congress then listened to the central speaker, the famous black leader Howard. In his speech, which fiercely criticized the current foreign policy of the American reactionaries, Howard said that American foreign policy was the product of banker diplomats and banker militarists. American cannons are currently slaughtering innocent civilians in at least three places in the world. Howard emphasized that the new party would fight for peace and Soviet-American friendship, and condemned the United States for using the threat of the Soviet Union as an excuse to establish a huge military program; condemned the Truman government for twice \"slamming the door on the peace plan\" after the exchange of letters between the United States and the Soviet Union and Stalin's reply to Wallace's letter, and is now \"reaping the bitter fruit it has sown\" on the Berlin issue. Howard continued to point out that the two parties have strangled civil rights and price controls in their domestic policies, and have formulated the reactionary Taft-Hartley Labor Act. Howard advocated the abolition of the conscription law and the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, and stipulated that the minimum wage for workers should be one U.S. dollar per hour. Howard's speech won enthusiastic cheers from the delegates. Following Howard's speech, there were 11 other leaders of the new party. The speakers all attacked the Republican and Democratic parties in unison. At the end of the day, the congress officially passed the permanent name of the new party as the \"Progressive Party.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为和平与美苏友谊而斗争　美第三党召开代表大会　讨论政纲通过永久名称为“进步党”\n\n1948-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　为和平与美苏友谊而斗争\n  　美第三党召开代表大会\n  　讨论政纲通过永久名称为“进步党”\n    【新华社陕北二十八日电】各方报导：美第三党第一次全国代表大会，二十三日于热烈兴奋情绪中在费城揭幕。大会到有美国各州代表三千名，连同各界来宾在内，参加大会开幕会议者，共达万人以上。大会系于不久前共和与民主两党举行大会之同一会场中举行。尽管反动报界及广播曾抄袭希特勒故技，发动“赤色妖魔”运动以诬蔑新党，但会场中的热烈情形，则与上两次民主共和两党的大会，迥然不同。代表席中，座无虚位。大会第一日为听取新党运动各主要负责人的演说，他们的演说不时为会场中热烈的掌声所打断。华莱士竞选全国委员会主席及前明尼苏达州州长宾生在其演说中宣称：新党将阻止被已变成富豪奴仆的两党统治，并将政府交还给人民。华莱士竞选运动主任鲍尔温于其演说中竞选新党运动的成功。鲍氏称，美国所有各州中均已有属于新党的各种组织。新党至少在四十四州内可以进行竞选。鲍氏最后建议新党定名为进步党。大会继即听取中心发言人，著名黑人领袖郝瓦德的演说。郝氏在其猛烈抨击美国反动派现行对外政策的演说中称：美国外交政策乃是银行团外交家与银行团军国主义者的产儿。美国大炮目前至少正在世界上三个地方，屠杀无辜平民。郝氏强调新党将为和平与美苏友谊而斗争，并斥责美国借口苏联的威胁以建立庞大的军备计划；斥责杜鲁门政府在美苏换文及斯大林答复华莱士信件以后，两度“砰然关上和平计划之门”，而现在则正在柏林问题上，“自食其所种下的苦果”。郝氏继指出：两党在对内政策上绞杀了公民权利与物价管制，并制定了反动的塔夫脱——哈特莱劳工法。郝氏主张废除征兵法与塔夫脱——哈特莱劳工法，并规定工人每小时的最低工资为美金一元。郝氏演说赢得了代表们的热烈喝彩。继郝氏演说者，尚有新党其他领袖十一人。演说者均异口同声地攻击共和与民主两党。当天大会最后正式通过新党的永久名称为“进步党”。"

At the meeting, representatives of more than twenty national organizations in the United States spoke out one after another, sharply criticizing American foreign policy and demanding that their suggestions be included in the New Party's platform. Ms. Rossol, representative of the \"Democratic Far East Policy Committee,\" demanded in her speech that economic and military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial regime be stopped immediately. She said: The United States' aid in dollars and arms to a reactionary regime that oppresses the people cannot bring stability and revival, but can only arouse the Chinese people's resentment towards the United States. A representative of the \"Association to Prevent a Third World War\" demanded an end to the policy of rebuilding Germany and Japan's military potential, and criticized the United States' policy towards Germany as a violation of the Potsdam Agreement and a threat to world peace. Mr. Pillinski, representative of the \"Slavic-American Congress,\" also strongly advocated that the United States stop the dangerous trick of rearming Germany as an anti-Soviet weapon in his speech.\n\nAccording to a TASS report on the 23rd, the Independent Entrepreneurs' Conference (i.e., small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, to distinguish them from monopoly entrepreneurs), chaired by a number of entrepreneurs supporting Wallace's Third Party, also passed a resolution condemning the current bipartisan foreign policy of the United States as a threat to world peace and independent enterprises. The conference, attended by 300 independent entrepreneurs from 20 states, declared in its resolution that the government's expanding war economy for the benefit of monopoly capital deprives independent entrepreneurs of much-needed supplies and loans, while reducing employers' purchasing power. The conference submitted several proposals to the Third Party Platform Committee, including the nationalization of major industries, anti-inflation measures, tax reductions for small businesses, government efforts to ensure that independent enterprises can obtain sufficient raw materials at fair prices, and the abolition of cartels. At the meeting, entrepreneur Ruhi used his twelve years of experience in doing business with the Soviet Union to illustrate that trading with the Soviet Union is not only entirely possible, but also consistently satisfactory.

    "content": "Column: Letters from Readers\n\n　　Quyang County Government Sends Letter to This Newspaper Explaining the Reasons for Wasteland\n　　To the Editor:\n\n　　Upon receiving your letter inquiring about the reasons for wasteland in Quyang this year, we have conducted investigations, research, analysis, and gathered feedback from the masses. The reasons are as follows:\n\n　　1. Land re-verified was not fully distributed to households. The remaining, poorer land was left uncultivated. For example, more than 90 mu in Shangzhuang, District 1; more than 150 mu in Shanghe, District 2; 98 mu in Nanxiaomu; and 4 mu of gardens in Tianjiakan were all re-verified land that remained undistributed.\n\n　　2. Farmers with little or no land who were allocated land preferred to cultivate the good land and were unwilling to cultivate the poor land (for example, in Nanguan, one household was allocated 7 mu of land but only cultivated 2 mu of paddy fields, leaving the remaining 5 mu of dry land uncultivated). In Zhanli Village, District 2, more than 80 mu were left uncultivated because the land was considered \"gagu\" (unfavorable) (for three or four years).\n\n　　3. Due to continuous years of natural disasters, there is a shortage of grain and grass, and livestock are not fed adequately. Furthermore, the unfair distribution of labor service burdens in the villages has led to a reduction in livestock, making cultivation difficult.\n\n　　4. Last year, rainfall was too late, and most of the planted buckwheat was affected by early frost, resulting in no grain harvest. In addition, there was a shortage of labor (human and animal power), making it impossible to cultivate all the land.\n\n　　5. In the past, some villages had excessively high tax quotas on land, resulting in heavy burdens. Moreover, the distribution of village burdens was unfair (in the past, some grain levies were based on harvest conditions; more labor and fertilizer resulted in stronger growth and higher taxes, which actually discouraged productive farmers). The masses felt that after paying taxes on the harvested grain, nothing was left. At the same time, the late rainfall led the masses to believe that even if they planted, they would not harvest much, so they were reluctant to plant (such as in Nanxiaomu).\n\n　　6. Land belonging to households with no descendants is not cultivated—for example, in Yangjiasha Hou, District 5, Yang Qiuhai died alone. The head of the family does not care, the cadres do not care, and all 7 mu of land have been left uncultivated.\n\n　　7. Due to continuous years of natural disasters, people are unable to maintain their livelihoods, and they flee to other places or engage in trade, only returning after rainfall. As a result, the land dries up and cannot be planted, such as in Zhuangzi and Niuluodou, where 10 mu have been left uncultivated.\n\n　　8. Some villages divided land equally this year, taking back large amounts of land from landlords and former rich peasants, \"and even mobilized some of the middle peasants.\" During the land distribution, there was blind allocation without considering the farmers' own needs and labor capacity. Even if they had enough land to cultivate, they were forced to cultivate more, which was actually impossible, resulting in both situations being delayed and the land being left uncultivated.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Quyang County Government)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 曲阳县府致函本报　说明荒地原因\n\n1948-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：读者来信\n\n　　曲阳县府致函本报\n  　说明荒地原因编者同志：\n    接读来函询问曲阳今年荒地原因，兹经调查研究分析及群众反映，原因有下面几种：\n    一、复查出之土地没有全部分配到户。余下的较坏些没人种荒了，一区尚庄九十余亩，二区上河一百五十余亩，南孝墓九十八亩，田家坎园子四亩等，都是复查出的土地没分配完余下的。\n    二、分给无地少地的农民的土地，他们只愿种好地，不愿种坏地（如南关分给一户七亩地，只种了二亩水地，其余五亩旱地荒了）。二区占里村，嫌地嘎咕（不好），荒了八十余亩（有三四年）。\n    三、由于连年灾荒，谷草缺乏，牲口没有喂的，再加上村里劳役负担不公平，以致影响牲口减少，耕种困难。\n    四、去年落雨太迟，大部种的荞麦，降霜更早，没打粮食，再加上劳力缺乏（人力畜力）种不及。\n    五、过去有些村地里统累税产量订的高，负担重，再加上村负担不公平（过去有些征粮根据收成情况，费工多、上粪多、长的强，多纳税，实际上打击了生产积极的农民）。群众感到种上所得之粮食纳了税不剩东西；同时雨下的太晚了，群众看到种上亦打不了什么东西，故懒种了（如南孝墓）。\n    六、绝户地无人耕种——如五区杨家砂侯，杨秋海一人死了。当家子不管，干部不管，将七亩地全荒了。\n    七、连年灾荒，无法维持生活，出外逃荒，或作买卖，下雨后才回来，结果地干了，种不上，如庄子，牛洛斗这样荒十亩。\n    八、有些村今年平分土地，由地主旧富农手里拿回大量土地，“还动员了中农一部”。在分配土地时，盲目的分配，没有根据农民自己的要求和劳动力的强弱，本来够种了，硬要叫多种，实际种不过来，结果两耽误未种上荒了。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（曲阳县政府）"

At five o'clock on the morning of the 16th, the street fighting in Xiangyang City developed to the core fortress of the Kang bandit headquarters on the city wall. When the People's Liberation Army's artillery shells destroyed a bunker, the soldiers broke into the courtyard, and after fighting for more than ten minutes in the yard, the enemy surrendered. Then, the entire army began to search for the special agent leader Kang Ze.\n\n　　In the first layer of the middle bunker, the soldiers captured a large fat man and asked him if he was Kang Ze. He replied: Commander Kang just ran away, I am Deputy Commander Guo Xunqi.\n\n　　It was already afternoon, and Kang Ze had not been found yet, everyone was very anxious. A certain regiment commander ordered Deputy Instructor An Bingren to take a few communications soldiers, led by Fu Qirong, a captured lieutenant follower of Kang Ze, to search again. Fu Qirong led them to a tunnel below the entrance of the Kang bandit headquarters. It was damp and narrow, and nothing could be seen; the stuffy and bloody smell made people nauseous. Corpses were lying horizontally and vertically. They turned on flashlights and groped forward step by step. Following the tunnel, they turned to the right, and it was still full of dead bodies. They walked further and felt strange. There was no fierce battle here, so why were there so many dead bodies!\n\n　　Walking forward, there was a stone staircase. Climbing up the stone staircase, they went down into a very deep pit. Everyone bent over and continued to move forward. The cave was so suffocating that they could not breathe. At this time, they suddenly saw a hole, with a dead body stuffed in the opening, and brains and blood were still dripping. They dragged the corpse away and saw five dead bodies inside. Suddenly, one of the corpses stood up, and everyone was startled. Kang Ze's follower turned around and ran out, but the communication soldier grabbed him. He gasped and said, \"I dare not see him, that is Kang Ze.\" An Bingren shone a flashlight on him, and the guy fell down again, motionless. An Bingren asked, \"Quick, tell me if you are Kang Ze?\" After waiting for a long time, he uttered a weak voice: \"I am an officer, take me out first!\" The communication soldier dragged him out. As soon as he came out of the tunnel, some of the captives were saying, \"The commander is captured.\" As soon as this guy heard this, he lay down again and refused to get up. The soldiers gathered around, some said: \"You big special agent leader, how many people have you killed? You must pay back the blood debt.\" Some said: \"You released poison gas and poisoned people to death, you must pay for your life.\" Everyone looked at the appearance of this big special agent in the twilight. His face, head, hands, and feet were covered with mud, and some dead people's blood was smeared on him. The grass-green American military uniform was covered with blood and mud and no longer looked like anything. Lying on the ground, he looked like a dead pig. No matter how everyone dragged him, he remained motionless. Everyone was extremely angry, and one soldier said: \"Don't play dead, if you don't get up, I will beat you!\" The dead Kang Ze heard that he was going to be beaten, and obediently got up. The soldiers escorted him to the front-line headquarters, changed his clothes, and washed his face. Everyone could see his ugly appearance with a high forehead, thick eyebrows, square face, and big ears. A little skin was scratched on both arms by shrapnel, and the injury was not serious, but his first sentence was: \"Does your department have a doctor? Will my arms be disabled?\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 活捉康泽详情\n\n1948-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　活捉康泽详情\n    【新华社襄阳前线二十八日电】前线记者报导：活捉康泽的详细经过。十六日上午五点钟，襄阳城的巷战发展到城墙康匪司令部的核心堡垒。当解放军的炮弹摧毁了一个碉堡，战士们突入围墙，在院子里打了十几分钟，敌人就缴了械。于是，全军开始搜捕特务头子康泽。\n    在中间大碉堡的第一层，战士们捉住了一个大胖子，问他是不是康泽？他回答说：康司令刚跑不久，我是副司令郭勋祺。\n    时间已是下午，康泽还没找到，大家都很着急。某团团长命令副教导员安秉仁带几个通讯员，由被俘的康泽的少尉随从傅起戎作向导再去搜索。傅起戎领着他们在康匪司令部门口下面，找到一条地道，阴湿而狭窄，什么也看不见；闷热和血腥臭味，使人发呕。尸体横一个竖一个的躺着，他们打着电筒一步一步摸索前进。顺着地道向右侧一拐，死尸还是堆的满满的，他们越走越奇怪，这地方并没有激烈的战斗，为什么有这么多死尸呢！\n    再向前走有一个石梯，爬上石梯，接着又往下走到一个很深的大坑里，大家弯着腰继续前进，洞里窒息得他们都透不过气来。这时他们忽然看见一洞，洞口上塞着一个死尸，脑浆和血水还在一滴一滴地流着。他们把尸体拖开，看见里面有五具死尸，猛的有一具尸体爬了起来，大家都吓了一跳，康泽的那个随从，却转身就往外跑，通讯员一把抓住他，他喘喘的说：“我不敢见他，那就是康泽。”安秉仁用电筒一照，那家伙又猛地倒下去，一动也不动了。安秉仁问：“快说你是不是康泽？”等了许久，他才发出微弱的声音来：“我是一个军官，把我弄出去再说吧！”通讯员把他拖出来，刚出地道，俘虏中就有人在说：“司令捉住了。”这家伙一听，又猛地躺下，死也不起来了。战士们围拢起来，有的说：“你这个大特务头子，你杀死了多少老百姓，要你还血债。”有的说：“你放毒气，毒死的人你要偿命。”大家在黄昏中看了看这个大特务的样子，满脸满头满手满脚都用污泥抹遍了，还抹了些死人的血，草绿色的美国军衣，被血和污泥涂得已不象样子，躺在地下活象一条死猪，大家怎样拖他也始终不动。大家气极了，有一个战士说：“不要装死，再不起来老子就揍你！”装死的康泽听说要揍，乖乖的爬了起来。战士们把他押到前线司令部，给他换了衣服，洗了脸，大家才看清他那高额头，粗眉毛，方脸大耳那副丑样。两膀被炮弹片檫破了一点皮，本来伤得并不厉害，但他第一句话就问：“贵部有医生没有？我的膀子该不会残废吧。”"

    "content": "Frontline reporters Song Chengzhen and Gang Yi reported that Yan bandit's Provisional 37th Division commander and deputy commander, Lei Yangtang and Zhao Heng, laid down their weapons, stating: When the People's Liberation Army approached the city of Qixian, the Yan bandit's Provisional 37th Division's Lieutenant General Commander Lei Yangtang and Major General Deputy Commander Zhao Heng, who were trapped in the city, repeatedly received orders from Yan bandit Xishan, ordering them to \"coexist with the position,\" and ordered them to behead and display the battalion commander of the third battalion of a regiment who lost Zihongkou Shangbai Lion Ridge (which the Yan bandits called \"King Kong Ridge\"), meaning to show them the consequences of not \"coexisting with the position.\" But when the People's Liberation Army shelled the city of Qixian on the 7th, they still did not make up their minds to coexist with the position. At 7:30, the People's Liberation Army broke into the city, and they were wounded. They ordered their guards to carry them into a cave in the northeast corner of the city, attempting to hide and escape, but before they had time to change into plain clothes, a soldier from their division headquarters guided the People's Liberation Army to track them down. At this time, they came out directly and shouted to our army: \"Please don't shoot, I surrender, I order everyone to surrender.\" They came out of the cave with their hands raised and asked our army's instructor to guarantee their safety. Then, they immediately ordered his surrendered special service company commander to lead our army to the northwest corner of the city to collect the mountain guns, and ordered his bugler to sound the surrender call, so that their remnants could quickly surrender their guns. He said that half an hour before our army's general attack on the city, Yan bandits repeatedly ordered them on the telegram to coexist with the county seat, but they did not listen to this nonsense. They said that Yan bandits have always been good at using nice-sounding terms like \"coexisting with the position\" to deceive people, but in practice, it is against the subordinates and not against the superiors, against others and not against themselves. After they laid down their weapons, the People's Liberation Army's medical staff immediately applied medicine to their wounds and found all the personal belongings they had left in the division headquarters and returned them. They said with admiration: \"The People's Liberation Army is too lenient to us, nothing is missing from our personal belongings, it is truly a benevolent and righteous army.\" They also said: \"Working over there (referring to the Chiang-Yan bandit side), sooner or later you can't escape being captured or killed, you should choose your path as soon as possible.\"\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【Jinzhou Frontline Communications】\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 活捉雷仰汤\n宋成祯　刚毅\n1948-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　活捉雷仰汤\n    前线记者宋成祯、刚毅报导阎匪暂三十七师正副师长雷仰汤赵珩放下武器经过称：当人民解放军直逼祁县城下，困守在该城的阎匪暂三十七师中将师长雷仰汤和少将副师长赵珩，曾接二连三的奉到阎匪锡山的命令，要他们“与阵地共存亡”，并命令他们把失守子洪口上白狮岭（阎匪称之为“金钢岭”）的一团三营营长枭首示众，意思就是让他们看看，没有“与阵地共存亡”的下场。但当七号解放军炮轰祁县城时，他们还是没有下定与阵地共存亡的决心，七点半钟，解放军破城而入，他们负了伤，叫卫士把他们架进城东北角的一个地洞里，企图隐藏逃跑，但还没有来得及换便衣，他们师部里的一个战士即引导解放军跟踪追上来了，这时他们就直接出来，向我军喊道：“请不要打了，我缴枪，我命令全部缴枪。”出洞时高举着手，并要求我军指导员保证他们的生命安全。接着，他们马上命令他已缴枪的特务连长，引我军到城西北角去收缴山炮，又命令他的司号长吹投降号，让他们的残部赶快交枪。他说在我军总攻该城的前半个钟头，阎匪在电报上还再三命令他们与县城共存亡，但他们没听这一套鬼话，他们说阎匪是一贯好用与阵地共存亡的好听名词欺骗人的，但在执行上，是对下不对上，对人不对己的，他们放下武器之后，解放军的卫生员，即马上给他们的伤口上药，并将他们丢在师部的私人东西，悉数找来归还。他们感佩的说：“解放军对我们太宽大了，私人东西一点不短，真是仁义之师。”又说：“在那边（指蒋阎匪方面）干事，迟早也逃不过被俘或打死，应该及早选择道路。”\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【晋中前线通讯】"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Xiangyang Front, July 27th: A frontline reporter reports on the capture of the Kuomintang secret service chief Kang Ze during the liberation of Xiangyang. After the People's Liberation Army entered the Jianghan and Tongbai areas earlier this year, Chiang Kai-shek immediately established a Pacification Headquarters in Xiangyang, a transportation hub for the four provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei, and appointed the notorious secret service chief Kang Ze as the commander. Among all eighteen Pacification Zones of Chiang's bandits, this was the first time such a secret service chief was appointed as commander. This not only demonstrates the important military significance of Xiangyang but also illustrates that Chiang Kai-shek, having suffered repeated defeats on the Central Plains front, directly adopted a secret service military rule in a vain attempt to sustain his failing situation.\n\nXiangyang faces the Han River to the northeast and directly east, and is surrounded by mountains such as Pipa, Zhenwu, and Fenghuang to the southwest and south, making its terrain very dangerous. The bandit Kang relied on the mountains to construct a strong defense system, and inherited the Japanese invaders' \"Three Alls Policy,\" demolishing all the houses of the people in the urban areas and the suburbs, attempting to prevent the Liberation Army from approaching the city walls. Deep trenches up to ten feet deep were dug outside the city, and landmines were laid throughout the barbed wire and obstacles. When the People's Liberation Army launched the Xiangfan Campaign, the bandit Kang ordered the local Chiang troops and two regular brigades from Fancheng and other places to retreat to Xiangyang, thinking that the deep trenches and high walls, combined with concentrated forces, would ensure a solid defense. Unexpectedly, the Liberation Army, with a force equal in number to the enemy, adopted a back-to-the-river strategy and captured Xiangyang in one fell swoop.\n\nWhen the People's Liberation Army attacked the Black Tiger Weir high ground outside Xiangyang, the inhuman bandit Kang released a large amount of poison gas and hung white cloths more than ten feet high on the roads of the Liberation Army's advance, writing, \"Those who invade will die!\" He attempted to use poison gas and incantations to hinder the offensive of the Liberation Army. But this only aroused the unparalleled anger of the Liberation Army soldiers. \"Take Xiangyang and capture Kang Ze alive\" became the unanimous action slogan of the entire army. Ninety percent of the soldiers in the sixth company of a certain unit volunteered to join the assault. After the general offensive began, the assault team climbed the city wall in just five minutes. The company commander of the first company of the assault team gloriously sacrificed himself, and the platoon leader automatically led the charge. When the platoon leader was wounded or killed, the squad leaders and soldiers continued to charge forward. The heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, one after another, finally overwhelmed the enemy, broke into the city, and captured Kang Ze alive, fulfilling the goal set by the slogan and the wishes of the soldiers.\n\nWhen the battle had clearly become hopeless, the bandit Kang even threatened his soldiers, saying, \"Die in battle or commit suicide; do not become a prisoner of the Communist bandits.\" But the Kuomintang officers and soldiers no longer listened to his commands and surrendered to the Liberation Army in batches. Finally, the Liberation Army entered the city, and Kang Ze personally led a regiment of troops to guard the Bell and Drum Tower, making a desperate struggle in an attempt to gain an opportunity to escape in disguise. However, this unit he led was the 104th Brigade, which had been annihilated in the Hua (County) Jun (County) campaign in northern Henan in November 1946. The Liberation Army soldiers who had been liberated from the Hua-Jun campaign actively used loudspeakers to call on those at the Bell and Drum Tower to surrender, and this regiment quickly abandoned the bandit Kang and surrendered completely. The secret service chief Kang Ze, who had neither \"sacrificed heroically\" in combat as Deng Wenyi had said, nor committed \"suicide\" according to his own slogan, obediently became a prisoner. This ruthless secret service chief, who usually rode roughshod over unarmed people and framed countless young people, has finally reached the time when his evil deeds are full and he will receive the final judgment of the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 背水作战下襄阳钟鼓楼中擒康泽\n\n1948-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　背水作战下襄阳钟鼓楼中擒康泽\n    【新华社襄阳前线二十七日电】前线记者报导此次解放襄阳，活捉法西斯特务头子康泽的经过称：今年年初人民解放军进入江汉、桐柏地区后，蒋介石立刻在川陕豫鄂四省交通总枢纽的襄阳设置了一个绥靖区司令部，而以臭名远播的特务头子康泽为司令官。在蒋匪所有的十八个绥靖区之中，以这样的特务头子来当司令官的，还是第一个。这不仅说明了襄阳在军事上的重要意义，更说明了在中原前线连吃败仗的蒋介石曾直接采取特务军事统治来妄图撑持其败局。\n    襄阳东北和正东面临汉水，西南和南面有琵琶、真武、凤凰等山耸立，形势十分险要。康匪依山构筑了强固防御体系，并继承日寇的三光政策，把城关和四郊老百姓的房屋全部拆毁，企图这样隔绝解放军接近城垣。城下又筑有深达三丈徐的三道外壕，在铁丝网和障碍物内满布着地雷。当解放军发起襄樊战役时，康匪便命令樊城等地土蒋军及两个正规旅退守襄阳城，满以为深沟高垒，集中兵力，可以固守。不料解放军仅以总数与敌人相等的兵力，并采用背水作战，一举而下襄阳。\n    当解放军攻击襄阳城外黑虎堰制高点时，灭绝人性的康匪即大量施放毒气，并在解放军前进的道上，挂起丈多高的白布，上写：“来犯者送死！”他企图利用毒气和符咒来阻遏解放军的攻势。但是这样只更加激起了解放军将士无比的愤怒，“打下襄阳，活捉康泽”，成为全军一致的行动口号。某部六连百分之九十的战士报名参加突击。总攻开始后，突击队仅五分钟就登上城头。突击队的第一连连长光荣牺牲了，排长就自动率领冲锋；排长伤亡了，班长、战士们继续冲上去。解放军战士们前仆后继的英勇作战终于压倒敌人，突入城内，活捉康泽，实现了口号规定的目的和战士们的愿望。\n    当战事发展已显然无望时，康匪还对他的士兵威胁说：“不战死就自杀，不当共匪俘虏。”但国民党官兵这时已不再听他的指挥了，一批批地向解放军缴械投降。最后解放军攻入城内，康泽亲率一团兵力把守钟鼓楼，作绝望的挣扎，企图赢得一个化装逃命的机会。但他所率领的这支部队就是曾在一九四六年十一月豫北滑（县）浚（县）战役被歼灭过的一零四旅。解放军从滑浚战役解放过来的解放战士，便纷纷对钟鼓楼进行火线喊话，这一团人也很快就抛弃康匪，全部投降了。而特务头子康泽，这时既没有象邓文仪所说的在作战中“壮烈牺牲”，也没有照他自己的口号实行“自杀”，而是服服贴贴地当了俘虏。这个杀人不眨眼的特务头子，平时压在手无寸铁的老百姓头上横行霸道，陷害无数青年，现在终于到了他恶贯满盈受人民最后审判的时候。"

    "content": "Soviet Labor Daily Commentary\n　　U.S. Aid to Chiang Exchanges Privileges and Threatens the Survival of the Chinese Nation\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: TASS Moscow, 18th: The Soviet Labor Daily recently published a commentary on U.S. aid to Chiang Kai-shek. The article stated: The recent new loan granted by the United States to the Kuomintang, like the Marshall Plan for Europe, is attached with conditions that genuinely threaten the survival of Chinese national independence. The first demand made by the United States to Nanjing is to implement \"freedom of foreign trade.\" China has already reduced the tariff rates on some American imports and allowed low tax rates to be maintained on many important imports. The quantity of imports must also be determined according to the opinions of American merchants; goods imported from the United States now account for nearly 80 percent of China's total imports. China's tariff revenue has become one of the means of guaranteeing American loans and is entirely controlled by American officials. Chinese production, trade, and distribution are also entirely controlled by American officials. South China—China's rich region, the world's largest deposit of antimony, tungsten, and lead, has long been coveted by American monopoly capitalists. Since the end of the Pacific War, the United States has almost completely squeezed Britain out of China, especially South China. The defeats of the Kuomintang army in Manchuria, North China, and Central China have forced the United States to concentrate its efforts on accelerating the colonization of South China and Southwest China. The Guangdong authorities have drafted special \"regulations\" regarding foreign investment, which allow American capitalists to establish many large enterprises in Guangdong, including the construction of Huangpu Port. According to the American plan, the role of the port will be similar to the role that Hong Kong has played in the past. Two hundred American companies have been approved to establish industrial factories in Guangdong. The article emphasized that the United States provides military assistance to the Kuomintang on the condition that all Chinese military institutions below the Ministry of National Defense are controlled by the United States. The so-called American military advisory group not only has the power to organize and train the Kuomintang army but is also responsible for performing the duties of the General Staff. This advisory group has 5,000 people, which is equivalent to a brigade in terms of quantity. In addition, the U.S. Navy also controls the Kuomintang fleet established with U.S. funding. The American economic plan in South China is also inseparable from its military plan. American military activities in South China follow three major guidelines: suppressing the national liberation movement in the provinces of South China; establishing military training centers and supply bases in South China for the Kuomintang to conduct the civil war; and carrying out strategic construction needed by the United States. In granting new loans to the Kuomintang, the United States has obtained new privileges to establish army, navy, and air force bases, a large part of which are already under construction in South China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏劳动报评论　美帝援蒋换取特权威胁中国民族生存\n\n1948-07-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏劳动报评论\n  　美帝援蒋换取特权威胁中国民族生存\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日电：苏联劳动报顷载文评论美国对蒋介石的援助。该文称：美国最近给予国民党的新贷款，象马歇尔对欧计划一样，附有真正威胁中国民族独立生存的条件。美国向南京提出的第一个要求就是实施“对外贸易自由”。中国已将一些美国进口货的关税率减低，并允许对许多重要进口货都保持低税率。进口数量也得遵照美国商人的意见决定；现在由美国输入的货物几占中国全部进口的百分之八十。中国的关税收入已变成担保美国贷款的手段之一，全部都为美官员控制。中国生产、贸易与分配也统统为美官员所控制。华南——中国的富庶地区，是世界上最大的锑、钨、铅蕴藏地，久已为美国垄断资本家垂涎。自太平洋战争结束以来，美国几乎已将英国完全排出中国，特别是华南。国民党军在满洲、华北与华中的败仗，使美国只能集中力量使华南和西南加速殖民地化。广东当局已拟出关于外人投资的特别“规章”，这些规章准许美国资本家在广东建立许多个大企业，并包括修建黄埔港。按照美国计划，该港作用将与香港过去所起过的作用相类似。两百家美国公司已获准在广东成立工业厂坊。该文着重指出：美国给国民党以军事援助是以自国防部以下的中国一切军事机构概由美国控制为条件的。所谓美国军事顾问团不仅有组织与训练国民党军队之权，而且负有行使参谋总部职务之责。这个顾问团有五千人，就数量言，等于一个旅。此外美国海军并控制了由美国资助建立起来的国民党舰队。美国在华南的经济计划也是与其军事计划分不开的。美国在华南的军事活动遵循下列三大方针：镇压华南各省的民族解放运动；在华南建立军事训练中心与供应基地以便国民党进行内战；进行美国所需要的战略建设。在给国民党以新贷款时，美国已取得了建立陆海空军基地的新特权，这些基地有很大一部分已在华南建筑中。"

When the 14th dam surface of the critical point was repaired by us to be two and a half meters above the water surface, it was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's army.

    "content": "[Ji Lu Yu Telegraph] On July 4th, when this reporter arrived two li away from the Kunshan Yellow River perilous project, I could see from afar on the top of the perilous project's embankment and the top of the dam many tall, orderly, and square things resembling tile-roofed houses. Those were the straw material piles and stone material piles that the masses of Kunshan, Dongping, and Nanwang had transported to repair the dam and bank revetment. The encircled embankments in that area were even more densely packed with stone piles, resembling a stone city in the mountains.\n\nThese stones for repairing the perilous project were transported during every war-time lull after safely weathering last year's flood season. Last winter, 2,200 cubic meters of stone were transported, and before this year's wheat harvest, the enormous achievement of 4,910 cubic meters of stone was completed. After the wheat harvest, because the major flood season was approaching, Kunshan County concentrated all its efforts, with the responsible comrades of the county and district personally participating in the leadership. In the scorching heat, they completed 4,000 cubic meters of stone in a seven-day blitz, totaling 11,770 cubic meters of stone.\n\nThe Kunshan perilous project starts from Lujiakou, passes through Hongchang, Jinnali, Guonali, Sunlou, Shiya, Qianxinzhuang, and Houxinzhuang, and ends at Shilipu, with a total length of nearly sixteen li, or 7,820 meters. It originally had forty-four dams. Based on the needs of the water flow, two new dams were added to the encircling embankment at Guonali last year, and this year four new dams were added between the tenth and fourteenth dams. White fish-scale dams are also being added at Guonali. When I arrived at the perilous project, the seventy-odd members of the Kunshan engineering team and the three shifts of the engineering team transferred from the Shounan flood control section were leading 350 laborers, regardless of the scorching sun, and were intensely battling the Yellow River. On each dam, they were busy carrying sorghum stalks, carrying stones, lifting stones, carrying earth, carrying willow branches, driving piles, and pulling ropes. They were shouting, challenging each other, and encouraging each other to do more.\n\nOn the new thirteenth dam, eight strong engineering team members were using rammers to tamp the foundation of the flood control house. Each of them was pulling on a rammer rope. The eighty-odd jin stone rammer, in the midst of the majestic and resonant rammer song, was frequently thrown about one zhang high, and then heavily slammed to the ground, venting their hatred for the Chiang bandits! Building the Great Wall on the banks of the Yellow River.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黄河岸上的长城\n君谦\n1948-07-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黄河岸上的长城\n    君谦\n    【冀鲁豫电】七月四日，记者行抵距昆山黄河险工二里远的时候，遥望险工堤顶上和坝顶上，有许多高大、整齐、方正象瓦屋形的东西。那便是昆山、东平和南旺群众运来修坝埽用的秸料垛和石料垛，国那里一带的圈堤上，更是石垛密集，俨如山区的一座石城。\n    这些修险的石料，是在安然渡过了去年的大汛期后，抓紧一切战争空隙赶运的。去年冬，运了二二○○方石，今年麦收前，又完成了四九一○方石的巨大成绩。麦收后因为大汛期迫近，昆山县就集中一切力量，县区负责同志都亲身参加领导，在酷热的天气里，以七天的突击，完成了四○○○方石，合计为一一七七○方石。\n    昆山险工从路家口起，经过红厂、靳那里、国那里、孙楼、石崖、前辛庄、后辛庄等七个庄，止于十里铺，全长近十六华里，七千八百二十公尺，原有四十四道坝，根据水势的需要，去年在国那里圈堤，又加修了两道新坝，今年又在第十道至十四坝之间，加修新坝四道，还正在国那里，加修白鱼鳞坝。当我到该险工时，昆山的七十余名工程队和从寿南修防段调来助工的三班工程队，正领导着三百五十名民工，不顾炎烈太阳的曝晒，紧张的在和黄河搏斗着，各坝上忙着扛秫秸、扛石、抬石、挑土、扛柳枝、打桩、拉绳等工程。他们呼着，互相挑战，互相鼓励着多干。\n    在新十三坝上，八名精壮的工程队员，在用硪打防汛屋的墙基，他们每人扯着一条硪辫子，八十余斤的石硪，在雄壮浑厚的硪歌声中，频频的被甩到一丈左右高，又重重的砸在地上，吐泄对蒋匪的仇恨！修筑着黄河岸上的长城。"
