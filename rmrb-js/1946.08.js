It is understood that their preliminary plan is to plunder two million shi of wheat from our area. Their method of plunder is mainly to exchange sea salt for grain from our area. In Shijiazhuang, every large dou of wheat is exchanged for 120 jin of salt; in Yuanshi, the enemy has coal and salt factories to plunder wheat, exchanging every jin of wheat for 7 jin of salt. Recently, the price of salt has risen sharply. In early July, 40 jin cost 1,000 yuan, but around July 20, it rose to 15 jin per 1,000 yuan. The reason for the price increase is an attempt to exchange sea salt for grain, cotton, and furs from our area.\n    Currently, our border areas are stepping up strict management of imports and exports, strengthening anti-smuggling efforts, preventing hoarding and speculation, and prohibiting grain smuggling.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 严禁粮食走私  国民党以高价海盐吸我粮食\n\n1946-08-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　严禁粮食走私\n    国民党以高价海盐吸我粮食\n    【本报讯】国民党统治区因发生严重粮荒，欲加紧掠夺我解放区粮食。据悉：其初步计划，要在我区掠夺二百万石小麦；其掠夺办法主要是以海盐换取我区粮食。在石门，每大斗麦子换盐一百二十斤；在元氏，敌人设有掠夺麦子之煤盐厂，每斤麦子换盐七斤。最近盐价大涨，七月初每千元四十斤，至七月二十日左右则涨至每千元十五斤。其涨价原因乃是企图以海盐换取我区粮食、棉花和皮毛。\n    现我边沿地区正加紧严格管理出入口，加强缉私，制止囤积投机，禁止粮食走私。"

Using the Guo Ziqi incident as a pretext (Note: This incident occurred on June 18th, entirely due to a misunderstanding, and the matter has not been resolved.), they refused to guarantee the safety of the CCP representatives, including Major General Huang Zhen, and forcibly: (1) Restricted Major General Huang Zhen and others from moving freely, confining them to the group's compound at all times and forbidding them from going out. (2) Moved Huang and others to the headquarters of the 31st Army Group, effectively placing them under surveillance. The CCP representatives in the Beiping Executive Headquarters, upon receiving the above information, lodged a protest, arguing that the Kuomintang's manipulation of the Guo Ziqi incident and its threat to the safety of the CCP representatives in the Xinxiang Group were preparations for its planned attack on Jiaozuo and the Liberated Areas of northern Henan, attempting to prevent the group from monitoring and stopping such acts of aggression.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 严重抗议！ 国民党反动派图进攻焦作威胁新乡小组我代表安全\n\n1946-08-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　严重抗议！\n    国民党反动派图进攻焦作  威胁新乡小组我代表安全\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】本月中旬，新乡国民党当局及新乡小组国民党代表，突对该小组中共代表施行无理恫吓，于借口郭子祺事件（按该事件发生于六月十八日，完全出于误会，且此事件未解决。）对中共代表黄镇少将等之安全拒绝保证，并强迫：（一）黄镇少将等不得自由行动，任何时间皆限于小组院内，不得外出。（二）将黄等移至三十一集团军总司令部，实行变相的看守。北平执行部中共代表接获上述消息，提出抗议，认为国民党玩弄郭子祺事件，威胁新乡小组中共代表安全，乃为其谁攻焦作及豫北解放区的准备，企图使该小组无法监视及制止此种侵犯行动。"

It is reported that the town was liberated by the Eighth Route Army in October last year, but was subsequently seized by the Kuomintang army in collaboration with puppet troops. On June 11th of this year, it was recovered again, but on the 15th, it was once more occupied by the Bai Xiaowu unit and Zhang Shiming's battalion of the Wuqing puppet army's security regiment, who continued to advance to Xishizi Village, attempting to seize Dakoutun (an important town northeast of Cuihuangkou). The long-term occupation of the town by the Chiang and puppet troops turned more than one hundred square miles from Yingjiashan to Dabai Village and west of Cuihuangkou into a \"no-man's land.\" Of the six districts in Wuqing County, a total of 131 villages and towns were occupied by the puppet troops in the town. In April alone, 35 cadres from the liberated areas were captured and killed by them, more than 200 people were killed or wounded, and hundreds of thousands of catties of grain were looted.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-01",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: According to delayed news from Tokyo: Japanese Communist Party member Okano Susumu, in a Diet interpellation on June 28th, stated: The Communist Party has consistently demanded that the constitution be drafted after being discussed by the majority of the people, with full consideration of the people's opinions, and then submitted to the Diet. Why is the government so eager to complete the constitution? We must correct the undemocratic nature of the constitution's submission to the Diet. The Prime Minister claims that the current constitution possesses democracy and anti-militarism. If the current constitution is a democratic constitution, why is it necessary to enact a new constitution? If the new constitution, as Prime Minister Yoshida says, is a continuation of the current constitution, this is tantamount to admitting that the new constitution is an undemocratic constitution. Regarding the discussion of the constitution, it has not yet been determined whether sovereignty resides in the people or in the Emperor. The Prime Minister says \"the people including the Emperor.\" If the Emperor is a member of the people, then there should be the provision in Article 13 of the draft, which states that the people are equal and should not be discriminated against. If the Emperor is a member of the people, he should be elected by the people. The government says that the Emperor's position comes from the people's feelings. There is no monarchy in the world based solely on the people's feelings. This is nothing more than a new kind of theocracy. Furthermore, there are some differences between the Japanese and English versions of the constitutional draft. If one reads the English version, it seems quite democratic, but if one reads the Japanese version, it is quite ambiguous. Is this not the Japanese constitution's democracy deceiving foreign countries? The Communist Party absolutely opposes leaving any political privileges in the hands of the Emperor and demands the enactment of a thoroughly democratic constitution. The House of Councillors is a new kind of aristocratic house that reduces the powers of the House of Representatives. The Communist Party opposes the House of Councillors and advocates a unicameral system. It also opposes the separation of powers; the executive body should be appointed by the Diet. The draft also stipulates the basic rights of the people. In the current situation, most government agencies are in the hands of capitalists, so their freedom is only the freedom of capitalists. We advocate that the constitution stipulates plans for the poor to fully utilize their freedom and demand that the constitution stipulates various clauses guaranteeing the people's stable and improving lives. The draft also stipulates the abandonment of general war. However, there are two kinds of war: just war and unjust war. The so-called unjust war is a war of aggression. A war fought to defend oneself against unjust aggression is a just war. Our constitution should clearly state the abandonment of wars of aggression and should not only say the abandonment of general war. From this, it can be seen that the government's intention is only to use the smoke screen of democracy to cover up the undemocratic nature of the new constitutional draft, to use the pretense of sovereignty residing in the people to cover up the essence of sovereignty residing in the monarch, in an attempt to continue the dominance of capitalists, bureaucrats, and landlords.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冈野进议会质问政府  揭露宪草非民主性 反对天皇保留丝毫政治特权\n\n1946-08-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冈野进议会质问政府\n    揭露宪草非民主性\n    反对天皇保留丝毫政治特权\n    【新华社延安廿八日电】据东京迟到消息：日共产党议员冈野进，六月廿八日在议会质问政府称：共产党一向要求宪法经大多数人民加以讨论，充分采纳人民之意见后始行起草，然后提出议会，政府何以如此急欲完成宪法？吾人须纠正宪法提出议会之非民主性。首相谓现行宪法具有民主主义性和反军国主义性，现行宪法倘系民主宪法，何须制定新宪法？新宪法倘如吉田首相所言系现行宪法之继续，这无异自白新宪法系非民主宪法。关于宪法之讨论，迄今未确定主权在国民之手抑在天皇之手，首相谓“包含天皇之国民”，倘天皇系国民，则有该草案第十三条所谓国民系平等，并不加以差别之规定；倘天皇系国民，应由人民选举。政府谓天皇之地位出自国民之感情，世界并无仅以国民之感情为基础之君主制，此不外系一种新式神权而已。又宪草之日文与英文间有若干差异，倘看英文颇有民主性，然看日文则颇含糊，此非向外国欺骗之日本宪法之民主性乎？共产党绝对反对留丝毫政治特权于天皇手中，并要求制定彻底民主之宪法。参议院乃缩小众议院权限之新式贵族院，共产党反对参议院，而主张一院制，又反对三权分立，执行机关应由议会任命。草案又规定国民之基本权利。如目前情形政府机关大部分握于资本家手中，则其自由仅系资本家之自由而已。吾人主张宪法规定得有穷人充分利用自由之计划，并要求宪法规定保证人民生活安定向上之各种条款。宪草又规定放弃一般战争，然战争有正当之战争及不正当之战争两种，所谓不正当之战争即侵略战争，对不正当之侵略战争为防卫自己而战之战争，乃正义之战争。吾人之宪草应明言放弃侵略战争，不应只谓放弃一般战争。由是观之，政府用意仅在以民主烟幕掩蔽新宪草之非民主性，以主权在民之假装，掩蔽新宪草主权在君之本质，以图延续资本家、官僚、地主之支配。"

    "content": "Taiyue Mining Industry is Developing\n    With the support of the democratic government, industrial construction in the Taiyue region has been recovering and developing over the past year. Among them, the construction of coal, iron, and magnetic industries has been the most successful. Coal mines are abundant treasures in the Taiyue region, extending from Pingyao, Jiexiu, Qinyuan, Anze, Lingshi, Huoxian, Zhaocheng, Fushan, Yicheng, Changzi, Gaoping, Linfen, Qinshui, Yangcheng, and Jincheng in the north, to Yuanqu, Pinglu, and Jiyuan in the south, covering an area of approximately 560,000 mu. The highest quality coal is the anthracite from Jinpushan and Lishugou in Jincheng, which has been tested by experts and praised as the world's top-grade coal, containing 95% carbon and a heating value of over 20,000 calories. Iron ore is most abundant in Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Gaoping counties. According to incomplete statistics from these three counties, there were 3,297 iron furnaces (square, stir-fry, pot, bar, plow iron furnaces, etc.) before the war, employing 21,304 workers. Currently, 462 iron furnaces have been restored, employing 3,820 workers, with a total daily output of 228,130 jin, accounting for 22% of the pre-war total output. The development of the coal industry is inseparable from the development of the iron industry. Statistics from Jin, Gao, and Yang counties show that there were 417 well kilns and step kilns before the war, including three small machine kilns and one large machine kiln. Most of them ceased operation during the enemy and puppet occupation. After the war, our democratic government deeply understood that the mining of coal is directly related to the lives of the masses, so it invested a large amount of loans into the coal industry to support private mining. In just one year, it invested 31 million yuan. Currently, 249 well kilns and step kilns, and nine machine kilns have been restored, accounting for over 60% of the pre-war level. There are two types of business models: cooperative operation and private operation. Cooperative operation mainly involves workers with labor power who jointly raise funds and work together, distributing profits according to shares. For example, the Kuiji Furnace Factory in Xiyu Village, Jincheng, produced 65 furnaces of goods from November 26th last year to April 20th this year. After deducting costs, the thirteen workers earned a total of 223,795 yuan in wages and dividends. The thirteen workers and their 35 family members could each buy 4.745 shi of millet at the market price at the time. In private operation, such as Ji Zhende, the owner of Jin Yi Xi Huo Iron Factory, was granted a loan of 50,000 yuan by the government as capital last year. In half a year, after deducting raw material costs and consumption, he earned a net profit of 85,844 yuan and developed another square furnace. He said happily: \"Many people say that private furnaces cannot operate in our liberated areas, but this is a complete lack of understanding of the government's policies. Now I understand that engaging in production in the democratic liberated areas is completely profitable, and the government will also support your development.\" The lives of workers have also improved, with monthly wages of about 4,000 yuan. Workers at the Jin Yi Xi Huo Iron Factory can also use their spare time and holidays to do sand turning for other factories, breaking the old rules that restricted workers in the past. The furnace factory also has worker bath facilities, and workers can freely go to take a bath after work every afternoon, paying considerable attention to workers' health. Due to the improvement of labor-management relations and the improvement of workers' production technology, significant results have also been seen. Worker Wang Bufang invented a method of combining square furnaces and pot furnaces for production after several days of research. In the past, square furnaces were dedicated to smelting ore, and then pot furnaces were used to melt and cast pots. However, after Wang Bufang's painstaking research, adding coal slag to the iron ore during smelting allows for direct pot casting, saving both raw materials and time. The Jin Yi Xi Huo Iron Factory adopted this method, saving 260 yuan in raw material costs per furnace, resulting in a profit of 100,384 yuan in four months.\n     (Xinhua News Agency Taiyue Branch)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳矿业在发展中\n\n1946-08-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳矿业在发展中\n    太岳区工业建设，一年来，在民主政府的扶持下恢复和发展着，其中尤以煤铁业磁业建设成绩最大。煤矿为太岳区丰富的宝藏，北从平遥、介休、沁源、安泽、灵石、霍县、赵城、浮山、翼城、长子、高平、临汾、沁水、阳城、晋城，直到南面的垣曲、平陆、济源等十八县，矿区面积约达五十六万余亩，质量最高者为晋城金普山、黎树沟的无烟炭，曾经专家化验，誉为世界高等煤炭，含炭素百分之九十五，热度为二万余卡。铁矿以晋城、阳城、高平三县为最多，据晋、阳、高三县不完全统计，战前有铁炉（方、炒、锅、条、犁铁炉等）三千二百九十七座，拥有工人两万一千三百零四人。现已恢复铁炉四百六十二座，工人三千八百二十个，每日总产量为二十二万八千一百三十斤，为战前总产量的百分之二十二。煤炭业的发展是与铁业发展分不开的，晋、高、阳三县统计，战前共有井窑步窑四百一十七座，有小机器窑三座，大机器窑一座，敌伪占领期间大部停止开采。战后我民主政府深知煤炭之开采直接关系于群众生活，故以大批贷款投入煤业中，扶植私人开采。仅一年时间，即投入资金达三千一百万元。现已恢复井窑步窑二百四十九座·机器窑九座，计达战前的百分之六十强。在经营方式上有合作经营、私人经营两种，合作经营大部为有劳动力之工人，共同集资共同劳动，按股分红。如晋城西峪村魁记炉厂，从去年十一月二十六日，截至今年四月二十日，共出六十五炉货，除成本外，十三个工人共赚工资洋及红利洋廿二万三千七百九十五元，十三个工人及其家属共卅五人，每人按当时市价可买入小米四石七斗四五。私人经营，如晋义西货铁厂厂主姬振德，去年政府贷给五万元作资本，半年中除原料成本及消耗外，净赚红利八万五千八百四十四元，又发展了一个方炉，他高兴的说：“许多人说咱解放区私人不能行炉，这全是对政府政策认识不够，现在我明白了，在民主解放区闹生产完全有利可图，政府还要扶植你发展”。至于工人生活也已改善，每月工资约四千元，晋义西货铁厂工人，并可利用闲暇、假期给别厂翻砂，打破过去束缚工人的旧行规。炉厂并有工人澡塘设备，工人每日下午下工可自由去洗澡，相当注意了工人健康。由于劳资关系的改善，工人生产技术的改良，亦见显著成效。工人王补方在数日研究中，发明了方炉与锅炉结合生产办法，过去方炉专司炼矿，再经锅炉溶化铸锅，但经王补方的苦心研究，在铁矿中和以煤渣溶炼，即可直接铸锅，既省原料又省时间，晋义西货铁厂采用此种办法，每炉可省原料费二百六十元，四个月中盈利十万零三千八百八十四元。\n     （新华社太岳分社）"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Overview of Production in the Taihang Region for the First Half of the Year\n\n    This year's large-scale production movement in the Taihang Region has gradually unfolded on the basis of the large-scale production movements of the past two years and the anti-traitor rent reduction (in new areas) and investigation and reduction (in old areas) this year, overcoming several difficulties. It has provided many new experiences and problems. The Taihang Xinhua Branch recently reported on the \"Overview of the Organized Movement in the First Half of the Year\" in the region. Excerpts are introduced below:    ——Editor\n\n    This year, the popularization and improvement of organized effort in the old areas of Taihang have made significant progress. In terms of popularization: in the Xingxi area of the First District, 90% of the main labor force regularly participates in mutual aid; in the Ping Shun area of the Second District, the population organized accounts for 76.4% of the county's population, while in Licheng it accounts for more than 60% of the total population (including women involved in spinning); Shexian County in the Third District, which is a relatively poorly organized county in the old area, has organized villages accounting for 85%, totaling more than 9,600 households, which also exceeds any previous year. In terms of improvement: since last winter and this spring, small-scale cooperatives have developed significantly. Xingxi County alone has 356 small cooperatives, of which Dushu Village has six, with a capital of one million yuan. Licheng has 975 small cooperatives. Only three of the thirty administrative villages in Pingshun do not have them. The First District alone has 123. The production and development of these small-scale cooperatives are new creations of the masses based on their own needs and are a sign of the further improvement of mutual aid and cooperation. The value of small-scale cooperatives in the entire organized movement lies in the fact that they combine mutual aid groups of simple labor cooperation with general cooperatives of simple capital cooperation. It is a labor cooperation combined with capital cooperation, and it is the most flexible organizational form that combines agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year. Although general labor mutual aid societies (such as Yue Wanshou's type, Zhang Xigui's type) have the content of small-scale cooperatives, they cannot be universally developed because of their large scale. Therefore, small-scale cooperatives have a broad path for development. The second budding creation in terms of improvement is the \"Production and Construction Joint Cooperative\" in Shangmatian, Zuoquan. The cooperative has five departments: agriculture, sideline occupations, business, health, and propaganda and education. The agriculture department has four production teams and twenty-three groups, with 156 full laborers and 110 half laborers, and also organizes temporary groups to study agricultural technology. The sideline occupations department leads textile, ironwork, transportation, and workshop units. The business department takes serving agriculture and sideline occupations as its basic task, and its business is to purchase raw materials and tools, and promote finished products. The health department leads a pharmacy, with two doctors. The propaganda and education department leads a private primary school and a bookstore. Yao Chengzhao, a bookstore employee, sells books and manages rural postal services in the morning, and serves as a volunteer teacher in the afternoon and evening, and is responsible for exchanging production information and experience. This comprehensive cooperative is an improvement in business and organizational form compared to Yue Wanshou's and Zhang Xigui's labor mutual aid societies, and is similar to Liu Jianzhang's comprehensive cooperative in Yan'an (Liu's comprehensive cooperative includes four types of business: production, consumption, transportation, and credit cooperation). Such comprehensive cooperatives can be referenced in large villages with a certain working foundation and cadre conditions; otherwise, it is not necessary to rigidly follow this pattern.\n\n    After the masses in the new areas carried out the anti-traitor rent reduction, they have great enthusiasm for production, and they have made great achievements in getting organized. In Lincheng of the First District, all but six villages have mutual aid organizations, which have played a considerable role in the wheat harvest. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 1,200 mutual aid groups in 124 villages in Xingtai, with more than 9,000 men and women participating. In Heshi Village, Lucheng, 500 households have 500 full laborers participating in mutual aid, forming 24 plow-pulling groups, combining 40 livestock (there were more than 200 before the war), and completing the sowing of 50 hectares of land. In the five districts of Changzhi, more than 74,000 people participated in mutual aid, pulling plows to sow more than 230,000 mu of land, accounting for 69% of the total land sown in the five districts. After eight years of destruction by the enemy and puppet regimes, the new areas generally lack animal power. Without getting organized, it would be simply impossible to complete the sowing successfully. The examples of Changzhi and Lucheng are sufficient to illustrate the achievements and strength of getting organized in the new areas. This year is the first year for getting organized in the new areas. The focus is on mass development. It is a bit too early to talk about improvement today, and it is impossible to require everything to conform to the principles of getting organized. Attention should be paid to rectification, consolidation, and improvement on the basis of mass development. The opinion put forward by the First Special Commissioner's Office that \"even if it is organized through administrative orders, it should not be canceled immediately with administrative orders\" is also reasonable.\n\n    The characteristic of getting organized in the border areas is to promote the experience of combining labor and military affairs for eight years. For example, Yucheng County, this spring, under the unified leadership of the Party, government, army, and people, mobilized 400 livestock in the third and fourth districts. Under the cover of the garrison soldiers and militia, it took five days of assault to complete the sowing of 40 li long, 15 villages, and 160 hectares of land in the border area. This large-scale experience of combining labor and military affairs is very valuable. However, this approach has a suddenness to it. Small-scale combinations of labor and military affairs in this village are still the regular and basic form. The main shortcomings of getting organized in Taihang in the first half of the year are: first, the development is uneven. Even in the old areas, there is unevenness between counties and counties, districts and villages, and in terms of quantity and quality. Among the 3,117 mutual aid groups in Licheng County, 1,037 are model groups, 1,526 are general groups, and 554 are temporary groups. Also, among the 1,230 groups in Zuoquan, 167 are model groups, 820 are general groups, and 243 are formal groups. Of the 128 villages in Shexian, 106 villages are organized, and there are still more than 20 villages (15%) that are blank. Changzhi and Heshun are better in the new areas, and other counties are worse. Secondly, not enough attention is paid to ideological education for getting organized. Many people in the new areas still think that participating in mutual aid is doing \"official business.\" The old areas have a history of mutual aid for two or three years, but some groups are still based on a kind of \"honor,\" and the blank areas do not even understand the mutual aid policy at all. Secondly, many mutual aid groups have outstanding problems, mainly the unfairness of equivalent value and insufficient democratic consultation to solve problems. This is due to insufficient publicity and education on the basic principles of \"mutual assistance and mutual benefit\" and democratic leadership. These will affect the popularization and improvement of getting organized. Third, the organizational leadership cannot keep up with the actual development of the movement. Some areas feel that getting organized cannot be improved, and the guiding principles are not clear. The main reason is that there is not enough research and summary. The development of small-scale cooperatives has been around for more than half a year, but some areas have not regarded it as a sign of the improvement of mutual aid and cooperation, which is one example.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行区半年生产概况\n\n1946-08-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行区半年生产概况\n    太行区今年的大生产运动，是在过去两年大生产运动和今年反奸减租（新区）查减（老区）的基础上，克服了若干困难，逐步开展起来的。其中提供了许多新的经验和问题。太行新华分社顷报导该区“上半年组织起来运动概况”。兹摘要介绍于后：    ——编者\n    今年太行老区组织起来的普及和提高，均有显著的进步。普及方面：一分区邢西主要劳力经常参加互助的达百分之九十，二分区平顺组织起来的人口，占全县人口百分之七十六·四，黎城则占全人口百分之六十以上（纺妇在内），三分区涉县是老区中组织起来比较差的一个县，今年组织起来的村庄也达百分之八十五，共九千六百多户，也超过以往任何一年。提高方面：去冬今春以来，小型合作社有大量发展。邢西一县有三百五十六个小型合作社，其中杜树一村，就有六个，资本百万元。黎城有小型合作社九百七十五个。平顺三十个行政村只有三个村没有。仅一区就有一百二十三个。这种小型合作社的生产和发展，是群众根据自己需要的新创造，是互组合作提高一步的标帜。小型合作社在整个组织起来运动中的价值，在于它将单纯劳力合作社的互助小组，与单纯资本合作的一般合作社合而为一，它是劳力合作兼资本合作，又是农副业结合贯彻全年最灵活的组织形式。一般劳动互助社（如岳万寿式的，张喜贵式的）虽具有小型合作社的内容，但因为它规模较大，不可能普遍发展，因之小型合作社就有它宽广发展的道路。提高方面第二个萌芽创造，就是左权上麻田的“生产建设联合社”。该社共设农业，副业，营业，卫生，宣教等五部。农业部下设四个生产大队，二十三个组，拥有全劳力一百五十六个，半劳力一百一十个，还组织临时小组，研究农业技术。副业部领导纺织、铁工、运输、作坊等单位。营业部以服务于农业、副业为基本任务，它的业务为购买原料工具，推销成品等。卫生部领导药铺一座，有医生二人。宣教部领导民办小学一所，书店一所，书店职员姚成兆，上午卖书兼理乡村邮务，下午晚间即担任义务教员，并负责交流生产情况与经验，这种综合性合作社，在业务和组织形式上，较之岳万寿、张喜贵的劳动互助社，已经提高一步，与延安刘建章的综合合作社已相近似（刘之综合合作社包括生产，消费、运输、信用合作四种业务）。这种综合性合作社，凡有一定工作基础和干部条件的大村可以参考，否则不必硬照这个样子搞。\n    新区群众反奸减租后生产劲头很大，组织起来已有很大成绩。一分区临城除六个村外，均有互助组织，麦收时已起了相当作用。邢台一百二十四个村据不完全统计，已有一千二百多互助组，参加男女劳力九千余人。潞城合室村五百户中有五百个全劳力参加互助，组成二十四个拉犁组，结合四十头牲口（战前有二百多头），完成五十顷地下种。长治五个区有七万四千多人参加互助，人拉犁下种二十三万余亩，占五个区全部下种土地百分之六十九。经过敌伪八年摧残，新区普遍缺乏畜力，没有组织起来，想胜利完成下种，简直是不可能的。长治潞城的例子，已足说明新区组织起来的成绩和力量。新区组织起来今年是头一年，其重点是大量发展，今天说提高还有点过早，要求它一切适合于组织起来的原则也不可能。应该注意在大量发展的基础上加以整顿，巩固与提高。一专署所提“即使是经过行政命令搞起来的，也不应该再用行政命令一下取消”的意见，也是有道理的。\n    边沿区组织起来的特点，是发扬八年劳武结合的经验。例如榆次县，今春在党政军民统一领导下，动员三四两区四百头牲口。在营兵，民兵的掩护下，经五天突击，完成了边地四十里长、十五个村庄、一百六十顷地的下种。这种大规模劳武结合的经验是很可宝贵的。但这种做法带有一种突击性，本村的小型劳武结合，还是经常的、基本的形式，太行上半年组织起来的主要缺点，第一是发展不平衡，即以老区而言，县与县、区村与区村、数量上质量上，都是不平衡的。黎城全县三一一七个互助组中，模范的一○三七个，一般的一五二六个，临时的五五四个。又左权一二三○个组中，模范的一六七，一般的八二○，形式的二四三。涉县一二八村中组织起来的村庄一百○六个，尚有二十多个村庄（百分之十五）还是空白。新区以长治、和顺较好，其他县较差。其次是对组织起来的思想教育，注意不够，新区还有不少人认为参加互助是办“公事”，老区互助已有二三年历史，但有的组还是建立在一种“荣誉”上，空白区甚至还根本不了解互助政策。其次不少互助组中都有遗留问题，主要是等价不公，民主协商解决问题不够，这是由于对“互助互利”、民主领导的基本原则宣传教育不够，这些都会影响组织起来的普及和提高。第三，组织领导赶不上实际运动发展。若干地区感觉组织起来提不高，指导方针不明确，其主要原因是研究不够，总结不够。小型合作社的发展，已有多半年历史，然而若干地区并未把它当作互助合作的提高标帜来看，即是一例。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Reports from various sources: The 21-nation peace conference is scheduled to begin today in Paris. The day before the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes stated that he hoped the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland could be signed immediately after the Paris Peace Conference, and that the U.S. position on the treaties was to support the results negotiated by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Byrnes also said: \"The U.S. Government reserves the right to consider any supplementary or new proposals on their own merits.\" He also declared: \"The U.S. Government reserves the right to change its position on matters where the Four Powers have not reached agreement.\" Byrnes summarized his views on the peace conference, saying: \"The method of drafting treaties is not as I had hoped in London, but it is still far superior to the method after the last World War.\" British Foreign Secretary Bevin, suffering from a minor illness, has been advised by doctors to rest completely for at least a week, so the British delegation will be led by Prime Minister Attlee. The French government has announced the list of its delegation to the peace conference, headed by Bidault, with representatives including Deputy Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour, Ambassador to the Soviet Union Catroux, Ambassador to Spain Massigli, Ambassador to the United States Bonnet, senior Foreign Ministry officials Lévi, Alphand, Seydoux, and thirteen technical advisors. Additionally, representatives of the foreign ministers of the four powers (Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union) met in the Luxembourg Palace on the 27th to discuss the issue of publishing the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and decided to publish the agreed-upon clauses on the 28th.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: The task of the 21-nation peace conference is to consider the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers and to make recommendations. The final formulation of the treaties is the responsibility of the four powers: the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. The issue of signing treaties with the five countries was first raised at the Soviet-American-British Potsdam Conference held last July, and the heads of state of the three countries instructed the Council of Foreign Ministers, established according to the Potsdam Conference, to resolve this issue as its \"current important task.\"\n　　Since then, the foreign ministers have held four meetings to discuss the issue. The first meeting was held in London from September 11th to October 2nd last year, convening 30 times and achieving considerable progress. Although the Soviet Union proposed signing agreements on the issues that had been agreed upon, it was not accepted by Britain and the United States, and the meeting adjourned without result. The second meeting was held in Moscow from December 16th to 26th last year, and an agreement was reached on the procedure for signing the five-nation treaties, but it did not involve specific issues. The third meeting was held in Paris from April 25th to May 16th this year. This meeting was the most contentious, and the differences of opinion among the governments on the draft treaties became more apparent. The fourth meeting was held in Paris from June 15th to July 12th this year. This meeting reached agreement on the important issues in the draft treaties of the five countries and determined the date of the 21-nation peace conference. The 21 countries participating in the peace conference are as follows: the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, France, China, Australia, Belgium, Byelorussia, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, Greece, India, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Union of South Africa, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Moscow News: The Soviet Cabinet Committee appointed the members of the Soviet delegation to the Paris Peace Conference on the 26th. The head of the delegation is Molotov, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Soviet Cabinet Committee, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Gusev, Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Nikolai Novikov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic Rotovskis, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic Valéskalns, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic Rooks, and member of the Soviet Foreign Ministry Committee Perilnovikov.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes issued a statement on the 27th, outlining the U.S. plan for the Paris Peace Conference. Byrnes stated: The main task of the four foreign ministers in the peace conference will be to explain the various treaties that have been drafted to the other seventeen governments. Byrnes stated: After the peace conference submits suggestions on amendments and additions to the treaties, the four foreign ministers must meet to consider these suggestions and agree on the final content of the treaties. The rules of procedure of the conference stipulate that each government sends one representative, and Byrnes will serve as the U.S. representative. There are two subcommittees in the conference dedicated to studying the economic issues in the treaties. Byrnes will send Clayton and Thorp to attend the two subcommittees. Dunn will represent Nabes at the political subcommittee considering the treaty with Italy. Harriman, Smith, and Caffery will individually represent Byrnes at the subcommittees. Pauley will also assist in handling the compensation issues in the treaties. Byrnes stated that Senators Connally and Vandenberg will not attend the opening of the conference with him, but when the conference considers the final draft, they will be in Paris to provide Byrnes with advice. State Department Counselor Cohen will accompany Byrnes to Paris.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Associated Press, Paris: UN Secretary-General Lie has arrived here from Moscow. Lie said that Stalin and Molotov were very optimistic about protecting future peace. He continued, saying that he had talked with Stalin for an hour and had several meetings with Molotov, discussing issues related to the organization of the United Nations and political issues.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎和会开始举行  贝纳斯表示希望会后和约即能签字联合国秘书长莱氏由莫斯科抵巴黎\n\n1946-08-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎和会开始举行\n    贝纳斯表示希望会后和约即能签字         \n    联合国秘书长莱氏由莫斯科抵巴黎\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】各方报导：二十一国和平会议，定今日起在巴黎开始举行，在开会的前一天，美国务卿贝纳斯表示，希望对意、罗、保、匈、芬的五国和约能在巴黎和会之后即行签字，美国对和约之立场，为支持外长会议所协商的结果。贝氏又谓：“美国政府保留对任何补充建议或新建议考虑其本身价值的权利。”同时宣称：“四强未获协议事项，美政府保有改变其立场的权利。”贝纳斯归纳其对于和会之观感称：“制订和约的方式虽不如我在伦敦所希望者，但犹远胜于上次大战后的方式。”英外相贝文因患微恙，医生嘱其至少须完全休息一周，因此英代表团由首相艾德礼率领出席。法政府已宣布其出席和会之代表团名单，团长为比道尔，代表为外交部次长薄尔特，驻苏大使贾德鲁，驻西大使马西格里，驻美大使庞纳，外交部高级官员梁维尔、艾尔蓬、赛都等，尚有十三名技术顾问。又息：英美法苏四国外长之代表，于二十七日在卢森堡宫开会，讨论公布对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案问题，决定于二十八日公布所已同意之条文。\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】二十一国和会的任务，为考虑四外长会议所提对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国的和约草案，并提出建议。和约的最后制定，由苏、美、英、法四国负责。去年七月举行的苏、美、英波茨顿会议上，首次提出了对五国签定和约的问题，三国元首并授命根据波茨顿会议设立的外长会议，解决这一问题作为它的“当前重要任务”。\n    此后各外长先后举行四次会议，进行讨论。第一次会议于去年九月十一日至十月二日在伦敦举行，集会三十次，曾达到相当成就，苏联虽提议在已同意的问题上签字，未被英美接受，这次会议遂无结果而散。第二次会议于去年十二月十六日至二十六日在莫斯科举行，曾就签订五国和约的程序问题达到协议，但未牵涉具体问题。第三次于今年四月二十五日至五月十六日在巴黎举行，这次会议争论最多，各国政府对和草中的意见分歧也更形明确。第四次会于今年六月十五日至七月十二日在巴黎举行，这次会议曾就五国和约草案中的各重要问题达到协议，并确定了二十一国和会的召开日期，参加和会的二十一国如下：苏联、英国、美国、法国、中国、澳大利亚、比利时、白俄罗斯、巴西、加拿大、捷克、阿比西尼亚、希腊、印度、新西兰、挪威、波兰、南菲联邦、南斯拉夫、乌克兰等。\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联内阁委员会于二十六日任命苏联出席巴黎和平会议代表团成员，代表团团长苏联内阁委员会外委会委员长莫洛托夫，副外长维辛斯基，苏联驻英大使古赛夫，苏联驻法大使鲍哥莫洛夫，苏联驻美大使尼古拉·诺维科夫，立陶宛苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长罗托夫斯基，拉脱维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长瓦莱斯卡鲁，爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部长鲁克斯，苏维埃外交部委员会委员培里尔诺维科夫。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】华府讯：美国务卿贝纳斯于二十七日发表声明，概述美国对巴黎和会之计划。贝氏称：和平会议中四外长之主要任务，将为向其他十七国政府解释已经拟定之各种条约。贝氏称：和平会议提出关于各条约修正案及附加案之建议后，四国外长必须集合考虑此等建议，并协议各条约之最后内容。会议章程规定每一政府各派代表一人，贝氏将任美国之代表。会议中有两个小组会，专为研究条约中之经济问题，贝氏将派克莱敦及陶尔普出席该两小组会。邓恩将代表纳贝斯出席考虑对意条约政治小组会，哈立曼、史密斯、卡佛利将个别代表贝氏出席各小组会，鲍莱亦将在会中协助处理条约中之赔偿问题。贝氏称：参议员康纳利与范登堡在会议开幕时，将不随他出席，但当会议考虑最后草案时，彼等将在巴黎向贝氏提供意见。国务院参事柯恩将陪同贝氏联袂赴巴黎。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】美联社巴黎讯：联合国秘书长莱氏已自莫斯科抵此。莱氏称：斯大林与莫洛托夫对于保护未来之和平问题，甚为乐观。继称：曾与斯大林谈话一小时，并与莫洛托夫会谈数次，所谈者，系有关联合国之组织问题及政治问题。"

The CCP Yan'an Headquarters has entrusted Zhou Zijian, Director of the Eighth Route Army Xi'an Office, to represent General Li Xiannian in negotiations with the Executive Headquarters' 32nd Group, which recently arrived in Xi'an. The negotiations aim to demand that the Kuomintang army cease its attacks on the CCP Central Plains Military Region's break-out troops and to adopt all effective measures to quickly resolve the issue of food supply for the CCP troops. After the Kuomintang army launched an attack on the CCP Central Plains troops on the 26th of last month, General Li Xiannian issued a statement demanding a ceasefire and prompt mediation. Although the Kuomintang side had to send a mediation group, it actually mobilized more troops and insisted on \"annihilating\" our break-out troops, making mediation impossible. The 32nd Executive Group, which recently arrived in the Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei triangle area, also sent a letter by airplane to Li Xiannian's troops, requesting him to send representatives to Longjuzhai, west of Shangnan County in southern Shaanxi, for talks before the 26th. However, Li's troops were under heavy siege by the Kuomintang army, and their location was far from Longjuzhai. Furthermore, there were no necessary means of transportation at the time, meaning that even if representatives were sent immediately upon receipt of the letter under normal conditions, it would be impossible for them to reach Longjuzhai on time.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: The Yan'an community held a grand memorial service for Comrade Guan Xiangying, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the auditorium of the Central Party School yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. Over a thousand mourners reverently viewed the portrait and silently recited Chairman Mao's eulogy: \"Utterly loyal to the Party and the country.\" Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Comrade Liu Shaoqi presided over the ceremony, with Comrades Ren Bishi and Lin Boqu among those offering sacrifices. After the sacrificial address was respectfully read, Comrade Ren Bishi reported on Comrade Xiangying's deeds during his lifetime. He first pointed out Comrade Xiangying's spirit of selflessly dedicating himself to the revolution, saying: In 1940, when he first contracted lung disease and came to Yan'an, it could have been cured if he had paid attention to rest early on. However, because he was concerned about the battles on the front lines, he resolutely requested to return to work in northwestern Shanxi, which eventually led to his being bedridden. He continued, saying that when the Red Army in the Hunan-Hubei-West Sichuan region was forced to withdraw under the encirclement of the Kuomintang reactionaries, it was due to his and Comrade He Long's correct leadership that the Red Army's strength was preserved. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the development of the 120th Division and the establishment of the Shanxi-Suiyuan liberated area were also due to their efforts. He obeyed the Party's discipline, valued internal Party unity, and even in his illness, he often exhorted everyone: \"As long as we are always united around the Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, the Party's unity will surely be victorious.\" Finally, Comrade Bishi emphasized that in the current situation of severe internal war crisis, we need even more to inherit his legacy, unite the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country to break the reactionaries' offensive in order to compensate for the loss of Comrade Xiangying's passing.\n\n　　Commander-in-Chief Zhu De delivered a eulogy, saying: \"Comrade Xiangying fought loyally for the revolution throughout his life, as if it were a single day. His death is a major loss to our Party and the people of the whole country.\" He continued: \"Comrade Xiangying was an outstanding proletarian fighter and a model Bolshevik of the entire Party. He had a firm belief in communism and the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. He was not arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat. He had a proper style and never cared about personal gain.\" At this point, Commander-in-Chief Zhu quoted a passage from Comrade Xiangying's last words during his illness: \"Comrades from petty-bourgeois origins often have their thoughts entangled because of personal interests. If they think about the revolution, their confused thoughts can be cleared up.\" The Commander-in-Chief called on the entire Party and the entire army to learn from his excellent qualities of sacrificing himself and his thinking of serving the people wholeheartedly.\n\n　　Comrade Lin Boqu delivered a eulogy, saying: \"Comrade Guan Xiangying's life was guided by Mao Zedong Thought. To commemorate him, we must study Mao Zedong Thought well and put the interests of the people first in everything.\" He then pointed out: \"Some Party members and cadres in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region still have complacency, self-satisfaction, and some serious liberalistic thoughts. We must examine ourselves in the study of the Party Constitution, transform our thinking, and further strengthen the border region Party ideologically to better defend the border region.\"\n\n　　Yan Kuiyao, Deputy Commander of the Joint Defense Army, represented all the commanders and fighters in mourning their beloved Political Commissar Guan and vowed: \"We will complete Political Commissar Guan's legacy and his unfinished work with a thousandfold and a hundredfold effort!\" The meeting lasted for two hours before adjourning.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延安追悼关向应同志  千余哀悼者默诵毛主席挽词弼时同志报告死者生前事迹\n\n1946-08-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延安追悼关向应同志\n    千余哀悼者默诵毛主席挽词\n    弼时同志报告死者生前事迹\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】延安各界追悼中共中委关向应同志大会，于昨日下午四时在中央党校大礼堂隆重举行，千余哀悼者静肃地瞻仰遗像，默诵毛主席的挽词：“忠心耿耿，为党为国”。朱总司令、刘少奇同志主祭，任弼时、林伯渠等同志陪祭，恭读祭文后，任弼时同志即报告向应同志生前事迹，他首先指出向应同志为革命奋不顾身的精神说：四○年他初患肺病到延安，如及早注意休养或可治好，但因他关怀前方战事，坚决要求回晋西北工作，以致后来卧病不起。继谓当湘鄂西红军在国民党反动派围攻下被迫退出时，由于他和贺龙同志的正确领导，得以保存了红军的力量。抗战中，一二○师的发展和晋绥解放区的创立，也是他们的功劳。他服从党的纪律，重视党内团结，病中亦常谆诫大家：“只要我们时刻团结在毛主席所领导的中央周围，党的团结一定会得到胜利”。最后弼时同志着重说明在当前内战危机严重的情况下，我们更需要秉承他的遗志，团结全党全军和全国人民，打破反动派的进攻，才能补偿向应同志逝世的损失。\n    朱总司令致哀词说：“向应同志忠诚为革命奋斗一生，犹如一日，他死了，是我党和全国人民的重大损失。”继称：“向应同志是全党优秀的无产阶级战士，模范的布尔什维克，他对于共产主义及中国人民解放事业具有坚强的信心，胜不骄，败不馁，作风正派，从不计较个人利益”。至此朱总司令引述向应同志在病中的一段遗言——“小资产阶级出身的同志，往往为了个人利益而使思想纠缠不清，若是为革命着想，纷乱的思想当可澄清”。总司令号召全党全军学习他这种牺牲个人的优良品质和全心全意为人民服务的思想。\n    林伯渠同志致哀词说：“关向应同志的一生是以毛主席的思想为准绳，我们纪念他就要好好学习毛主席的思想，一切以人民利益为前提。”继即指出：“陕甘宁边区一些党员干部中，尚存在着自足自满和某些严重的自由主义思想，我们要在学习党章中来检查自己，改造思想，使边区党在思想上进一步的加强起来，更好的保卫边区。”\n    联防军副司令员阎揆要同志代表全体指战员哀悼他们所爱戴的关政委，并誓言：“我们将以千百倍的努力，来完成关政委的遗志和他未竟的事业！”大会历时二小时始散会。"

Managers, workers, and apprentices are all very happy. The \"Dawn Silk Weaving Factory\" was prepared in March of last year and started work in May. At that time, there were five skilled workers and five apprentices. In addition to the factory preparing some of the tools, many were brought by the workers themselves as equity investments. The factory was responsible for repairing any damage, and the tools remained the property of the original owner. Everyone was very satisfied with this. However, the skilled workers were unwilling to teach their skills to the apprentices, resulting in low work efficiency and poor products. They worked until the end of the year without earning a penny. After reviewing and improving their ideology, they proposed \"Apprentices are everyone's apprentices, and masters are everyone's masters,\" calling on apprentices to respect their masters, learn the strengths of each master, and pay attention to timely praising the advantages of each skilled worker. Recently, a New Heroism movement has been launched, and the reward method is that, in addition to the amount of silk reeled, the quality of reeling, the amount of weaving, and the uniformity of the lines, the skilled workers are also judged on how actively they help the apprentices. Apprentices are judged not only on the quality of their winding but also on their efforts to learn and help others. They are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D, and awarded prizes monthly. This has greatly improved the relationship between skilled workers and apprentices, and greatly increased production efficiency and production technology. Therefore, the factory could only produce some small handkerchiefs and mosquito netting bottoms last year, but now it can weave all kinds of beautiful patterned silk fabrics, and is also trying to weave some semi-cotton, semi-silk socks, vests, and other daily necessities. It is said that the sales are very good, and there is a large demand. In the first half of this year alone, from January to June, they earned 200,000 yuan (the factory's capital is also only 200,000 yuan). The living standards of workers and apprentices have also been improved as a result. Usually, they have three meals a day, but when reeling silk, they increase to five meals. The factory provides apprentices with clothes, shoes, and socks, and skilled workers receive a monthly wage of one *shi* of rice at market price in addition to their meals.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 打通思想改善师徒关系  曙光丝织厂质量俱增  美丽绸缎供不应求\n\n1946-08-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　打通思想改善师徒关系\n    曙光丝织厂质量俱增       \n    美丽绸缎供不应求\n    【本报阳城讯：】阳城“曙光丝织厂”自改善师徒关系后，生产效率大为提高，产品质量好、卖的快，大家生活改善了，经理、工人、学徒都很高兴。“曙光丝织厂”是去年三月间筹备，五月里开工的，当时共有五个技术工人和五个学徒，工具除工厂等筹备一部分外，很多都是工人自己带来作价入股的，损坏了由工厂负责修理，工具仍归原主所有，在这上面大家都很满意。只是技术工人不愿把自己的技术教给学徒，致使工作效率提不高，产品又很差，一直干到年底也没有赚一个钱。经检讨打通思想后，提出“徒弟是大家的徒弟，师傅是大家的师傅”，号召学徒要尊重师傅，学习每个师傅的长处，并注意及时表扬各个技术工人的优点。最近又开展了新英雄主义运动，订出的奖励办法是，技工除丝打得多、打得好、织得多、线条匀外，还要看帮助徒弟积极不积极作标准，学徒除轮线好坏外并以努力学习帮助别人为标准，分甲乙丙丁四等，一月一评奖，这样便大大的改善了技术工人与学徒的关系；也大大地提高了生产效率与生产技术，故该厂去年只能出一些小手绢、小网罗底等，现在却已能织出各式美丽花格的绸缎了、并且正在试织一些半棉半丝袜子、背心等日用品，据说销路很广，大有供不求之势，仅今年正月至六月半年内便赚了廿万元（该厂资本也只有二十万元）。工人学徒生活待遇也因而提高了，平常三顿饭，打丝时便增至五顿饭，学徒衣服鞋袜均由工厂供给，技术工人除吃外，每月还按市价发一石米的工钱。"

    "content": "[This report from our newspaper in Taihang]:\n\n　　Government and People Jointly Form Water Conservancy Management Committee\n    Preliminary Resolution of Long-Standing Water Dispute on the Dan River\n    Four Provisional Agreements Reached Based on the Spirit of Unity and Mutual Benefit\n    [This newspaper, Taihang News] The democratic government, adhering to the principle of unity and mutual benefit, has mediated the water disputes between the two banks of the Dan River, achieving a satisfactory preliminary resolution to this major issue that has remained unresolved for many years.\n    The Dan River is over 230 li long, originating in Gaoping County, Shanxi, and converging into the Qin River at the border of Qinyang and Bo'ai counties, ten li east of Qinyang county seat. The crisscrossing ditches and canals along the lower reaches of both banks constitute a rice and bamboo growing region of forty to fifty li in Qinyang and Bo'ai counties, known as \"the Jiangnan of Northern Henan.\" However, the water disputes between the people on both banks have remained unresolved for many years. Near Chenzhuang Village in Bo'ai County, where the Dan River flows into the plain, a \"herringbone\" weir was constructed, dividing the water in a ratio of six to the east and four to the west. Due to riverbed changes over time, the actual water usage had long become a ratio of 6.8 to the east bank and 3.2 to the west bank, leading to many years of litigation and countless expenses, even resulting in loss of life. However, due to the greater influence of the feudal groups on the east bank, the west bank was never able to reclaim its water rights. During the enemy occupation, a reservoir was built near Chenzhuang to irrigate the rice fields seized from Chinese farmers, and a top dam was also constructed to divert water eastward, further reducing the water volume on the west bank. This year, in order to consolidate this water distribution status, the villages on the east bank built a barrage dam near the water diversion point in Chenzhuang, leaving only one gate opening for the west bank, causing even greater dissatisfaction among the people on the west bank. After mobilizing the masses this year, the villages on the west bank immediately demanded a redistribution of water, requesting at the very least a return to the six-to-four ratio of east to west, and pointed out that the historical reason for the six-to-four distribution during the Qing Dynasty was that the east bank was responsible for transporting grain for the imperial court. Since there is no longer a grain transport burden, water resources should be equally distributed. The Fourth Administrative Office sent personnel to mediate for the first time, but without a resolution, and then in June engaged Mr. Fan Lunwu, Administrative Member of the Border Region Government, and Chief Liu, a water conservancy expert from Xinhua Corporation, along with a staff member from the Construction Section of the Administrative Office, to conduct on-site investigations and mediation. However, since it is currently the irrigation season, destroying the east bank's construction to redistribute water, and restoring the old canals and weirs on the west bank, would not be easy, and neither east nor west banks would be able to irrigate, which would be detrimental to production. Furthermore, the east bank's water conservancy projects are more developed and advanced, and destroying them would be a pity. Under the principle that \"the people of the liberated areas are one family,\" the losses of the people on the west bank can be compensated for through other means. Based on this spirit, the three-person team consulted with representatives from both banks and, on the basis of increased awareness and unity among the people on both sides, reached four provisional agreements at the end of June, while continuing to conduct on-site investigations for a final resolution in the autumn. The agreements are as follows: 1. Maintain the current status of water conservancy construction on both the east and west banks, and no additions or demolitions are allowed. 2. An additional water discharge gate will be built at the eastern end of the east bank's barrage dam. If this gate is damaged by floods, the leakage should be maintained at more than twice the current leakage. 3. The water source for the Shangqin River (the canal on both banks) is stipulated to be three zhang and shall not be changed. 4. The agreement is valid for three months, pending a thorough and reasonable resolution in the autumn. To supervise the implementation of the agreement and manage water use on both sides, the Dan River Water Conservancy Management Committee will be formed, consisting of one person from the Construction Section of the Administrative Office and one representative from each bank after the meeting. This long-standing water dispute has thus achieved a preliminary resolution under the principle of unity and mutual assistance. (Hao Shengrong)\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Jining, 23rd] This spring in the Liangcheng and Helin liberated areas of Southern Sui, the government and the people jointly undertook water conservancy projects, building a total of thirty-five canals (including ten repaired old canals and twenty-five newly built canals). Twenty-nine have been completed and six are still under construction, employing over 20,000 workdays. This has enabled the irrigation of over 53,000 mu of land, of which over 20,000 mu can increase grain production by over 3,100 shi this year (30,000 mu are silted fields for cultivation next year). This is a major agricultural project in the Southern Sui area. For this purpose, Sui Meng issued 3.2 million yuan in water conservancy loans, and county and district cadres personally went to the countryside to actively lead the canal construction. Water conservancy committees have been established in various places, and representatives have been democratically elected to be responsible for leadership. Cadres and representatives played a major role in the successful completion of the project. In Chen Lianyaozi, Lin Zhao District, the proposal to build a canal was made this spring, but construction did not begin until the end of April. After investigation by the cadres, it was found that the village's big landlord, because he had too much land to cultivate, feared that small households would do more work and he would have to pay more wages. He therefore used the excuse of being busy with cultivation to refuse to start construction. As a result, the big households did not start work, and the small households did not act. The cadres immediately convened the masses for discussion and, after deciding on wages, immediately started construction.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 政府人民共组水利管理委员会  丹河远年水争初步解决  本团结互利精神获临时协议四项\n郝生荣　\n1946-08-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　政府人民共组水利管理委员会\n    丹河远年水争初步解决\n    本团结互利精神获临时协议四项\n    【本报太行讯】民主政府以团结互利的原则调解丹河两岸的水利纠纷，使这一历史上久悬未决的重大问题已圆满获得初步解决。\n    丹河全长二百卅余里，源出山西高平县，在沁阳县城东十里，沁、博两县界上会合入沁河。下游两岸沟渠纵横，构成沁、博两县纵横四、五十里的水稻竹园区，人称“豫北江南”但两岸人民之争水事件则多年未决。丹河在流入平原之博爱陈庄村附近，筑有“人字”堰一道，分水为东六西四。后因河道变迁，实际用水量早变成东岸六分八，西岸三分二的比例，因此争讼多年，耗资无算，且闹出人命，但因东岸封建集团较有势力，西岸水利终未争回。敌寇占领时曾在陈庄附近筑蓄水池，为灌溉其夺自中国农民的稻田，又筑有顶坝驱水东流，西岸水量更见减少。今年东岸各村为巩固此种分水现状，又在陈庄附近分水处，筑拦河堰一条，仅给西岸留闸口一个，引起西岸人民更大不满。今年发动群众后，西岸各村即要求重新分水，最低限度要求恢复东六西四状态，且提出前清时代分水为东六西四根源，系东岸负担为皇家运粮，现在既无运粮一项负担，水利即应平均分配。四专署第一次派员前往调解，未获解决，即于六月聘请边府行政委员范纶五先生，新华公司水利专家刘科长协同专署建设科一人前往勘查调解。但因目前正值灌溉季节，若破坏东岸建筑重新分水，而西岸恢复旧日渠堰等亦非易事，东西两岸均不能灌溉，结果对生产不利。且东岸水利事业较发达建筑进步，破坏亦属可惜，在“解放区人民是一家”的原则下，西岸人民损失，可设法以他法弥补之。三人小组本此精神与两岸代表商洽结果，在两岸人民认识提高与团结的基础上，于六月底获得临时协议四条，余特继续勘查，秋后解决。其协议为：一、维持东西两岸水利建筑现状，不得丝毫添筑或折除。二、东岸拦河堰东端增建放水闸口一处，此闸若被洪水破坏，其漏水量亦维持在现在漏水量的两倍以上。三、上秦河（两岸渠）水源规定为三丈，不得更改。四、协议有效期为三个月，待秋后彻底合理解决。为监督协议执行，管理东西用水，专署建设科一人两岸代表各一人持于会后组成丹河水利管理委员会，此一多年争水纠纷而在团结互助原则下获得初步之解决。（郝生荣）\n    【新华社集宁二十三日电】今春绥南凉城和林解放区，政府与人民合力兴办水利，共修渠三十五条（其中补修旧渠十条，新开渠二十五条多），现二十九条已全部竣工，六条尚在修筑中，共用两万余工。使五万三千余亩土地得到灌溉，其中两万余亩今年可增产粮食三千一百余石（三万亩为淤田，明年耕种）。这是绥南区农业上的一个大工程，为此，绥蒙曾发放水利贷款三百二十万元，县区干部均亲自下乡，积极领导修渠，各地并成立水利委员会，民主选出代表，负责领导。干部和代表们，对于这次顺利完成工程起了很大作用。林兆区陈连窑子今春就提议修渠，但迟至四月底不见动工，经干部调查后，发现该村大地主因地多种不完，怕小户多做工自己多出工钱，故借口忙于耕种不愿动工，结果大户不开工，小户不动手。干部当即召集群众讨论，决定工资后，即刻兴工建筑。"

Before the War of Resistance, a few households raised silkworms, but this stopped after the war. This year, after the government called for the development of sideline production, all sixty households in the village raised a surprising eighty-five silkworm beds, greatly exceeding the pre-war number. In the first half of this year, they harvested a total of 5,500 jin of cocoons, which were spun into silk and sold for 900,000 yuan in foreign currency. After deducting labor costs (650 yuan per worker), each household had an average income of 15,000 yuan. Now, the newly added thirty-five piglets, five donkeys, and one cow in Xianling Village were all bought with only a portion of the profits from silkworm rearing. This fact has greatly encouraged cadres and the masses throughout the district to have confidence in developing sideline production such as silkworm rearing.\n    [Report from Heze by this newspaper] Zhai Chongru, a villager of Wangqing Village in Juancheng County, relied on raising pigs to survive several years of famine and became wealthy. Zhai Chongru's family of seven had only 2.7 mu of land. During the famine of 1943, they did not have enough to eat, so he began experimenting with raising pigs. That year, two sows gave birth to twenty-five piglets, earning him a total of 25,000 yuan. Since then, he has had several litters of piglets every year and has also accumulated fifteen or sixteen large cartloads of pig manure. To date, in four years, he has earned more than 152,000 yuan just from selling piglets. He now has 42.7 mu of land. Besides the 11.7 mu he mortgaged in, the remaining 27.3 mu were bought with half of the money from selling piglets—74,800 yuan. His life has improved, and he tells everyone about the democratic government's policy of preventing disasters, preparing for famine, developing sideline occupations, and saving themselves through production.

Before the \"tax exemption\" order reached He County, the county government had already exacted 100,000 shi of grain from the people in advance, which was far more than the land tax itself. After the order arrived, they implemented a disguised grain levy under the name of \"requisition.\" In March, they forcibly bought grain at the officially stipulated price of 3,000 yuan per shi, and only disbursed the payments when the rice price rose to around 30,000 yuan. Moreover, the township chiefs, bao chiefs, and even the township people's representatives engaged in corruption at every level, and levied additional taxes on the people due to uneven distribution of the spoils. The people of He County suffered greatly from the ravages of the enemy and puppet troops and the Kuomintang army's searches and plunder. However, they considered the actions of the New Fourth Army when it was stationed there as a miracle and expressed a longing for them. Ordinary citizens and farmers said, \"The New Fourth Army never loved money, paid for what they bought, never took or borrowed by force, returned what they borrowed, compensated for what they damaged, filled the water jar before leaving after using the water, and swept the residential houses clean when they departed; they engaged in production to reduce the burden on the people, helped the people with farming, implemented rent and interest reduction, and recalled all the Dajiang notes (currency used by the New Fourth Army) before withdrawing, so as not to let the common people suffer.\" The people said, \"Only the New Fourth Army is the real people's army.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪文汇报载称  不堪蒋政权横征暴敛和县人民怀念新四军\n\n1946-08-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪文汇报载称\n    不堪蒋政权横征暴敛和县人民怀念新四军\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】沪文汇报载通讯称：国民党当局接收和县（皖省属）后，尽情横征暴敛，县政府于“免征田赋”政令到达和县以前，就预先向人民苛征十万石，单这项就比田赋多得多，及至政令到达以后，又在“征购”名义下，实行变相的征粮。在三月间用官方规定每石三千元的价格强买，直至米价涨到三万元上下时，才拨付款项，且乡长保长甚至乡民代表，层层舞弊，因分赃不均，又向老百姓加征。和县人民饱受敌伪军的蹂躏与国民党军的搜刮掳掠，但对新四军驻扎该地时的所作所为认为是奇迹，流露追恋之情。一般市民和农民都说：“新四军从不爱钱，买东西给钱，不强拿强借，借东西还原，弄坏了照赔，用了水临走挑满一缸，住民宅开拔时打扫干净；自己生产减轻人民负担，还帮人民耕种，实行减租减息，撤退前就将大江票（新四军所用之票）全部收回，以免老百姓吃亏”。老百姓说：“只有新四军才是真正的人民军队。”"

Although a layer of dry heat arose not long ago, it has now been completely eradicated by the incessant rains, to the delight of the cotton farmers. Under the specific leadership and organization of all county-level cadres dispatched by the county committee and county government, the county's 394 mutual aid teams and 104 work teams are gradually transitioning into piece-rate mutual aid work teams. The eleven mutual aid work teams in the two townships of the urban area have all transitioned to piece-rate. Currently, men, women, and children can be seen everywhere in the cotton fields. Zhao Shangming from the Sixth Township of the urban area, leads his wife in piece-rate work under the scorching midday sun. When passersby advise them to work later in the day, he enthusiastically says, \"No, the cotton grows better when we work piece-rate in the morning.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: The Zhongliu large sluice gate on the Yalu River, irrigating more than 30,000 mu of paddy fields, suffered damage after \"August 15th\" liberation.

The Andong government allocated 100,000 yuan and sent personnel to assist in the repair. After two months of effort, it was completed last month, to the jubilation of the local people.

The main targets of these loans are rural handicrafts, industry, and the coal, iron, porcelain, and water conservancy industries. The specific allocation figures for the Taihang, Taiyue, Ji'nan, and Ji-Lu-Yu regions are currently being discussed with the administrative offices of each region. Furthermore, in order to improve and expand the Pengcheng porcelain industry, the Border Region Government has decided to lend 20 million yuan, which will be discussed and distributed democratically by Pengcheng potters and workers to industrialists and the porcelain industry sales cooperative. The interest rate on this porcelain industry loan is extremely low. It is reported that the most pressing problem for the Pengcheng porcelain industry is opening up sales channels. In order to prevent private manipulation and affect industrial development, the government has organized a public-private joint venture sales cooperative to transport goods in a timely manner and ensure that industrialists are profitable. (Agricultural)\n    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng News] Industry in Jincheng, Yangcheng and other counties in the Taiyue region is developing actively under the support of the democratic government. In the past six months, the Ji'nan Bank has issued more than 7,111,900 yuan in loans in Jincheng County alone. As of now, a total of 15 new factories have been built in the county, and the Yongyu Iron Industry Company, which has been in preparation for more than a month, has also started construction recently. The potassium nitrate (saltpeter) industry in Xizhi, Yangcheng County, which was severely damaged by the enemy, has now exceeded three times its pre-war production with the strong help of the democratic government. In addition, the egg industry has also seen new developments. Recently, a large-scale egg factory, initiated and prepared by Mr. Chen Ruitang of Jincheng and others, is actively building houses and will be able to start construction in the autumn. The chicken farm attached to the factory has already produced 150,000 chicks.\n    [Weixian News] The leather and hat industry in Daying Town, Zaoqiang County, Ji'nan, which was once prosperous, almost completely collapsed after the enemy's invasion. Although the democratic government has made every effort to promote it after the victory, most of the owners of the industry have adopted a wait-and-see attitude because they failed to understand the development of industry and commerce policies in the liberated areas for a while. After repeated explanations and practical support, 39 new leather workshops and 34 hat workshops have been established in the villages around Daying Town. Both workshops have more than 100 workers and have received a total of 2.37 million yuan in low-interest industrial loans from the government. In addition, there are now more than 20 leather workshops in Daying Town alone. In addition, supporting industries and commerce have also emerged, including 54 grocery stores, grain stores, and bicycle shops, all of which have received various low-interest industrial and commercial loans from the government and have made substantial profits.

When Mr. Tao was dying, Shen Junru, Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League and leader of the National Salvation Association, and several old friends of Mr. Tao were at his side. Upon hearing the news, CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao immediately drove to his residence at 11:00 a.m. that day (the 25th). However, Mr. Tao had already stopped breathing, though his palms were still warm. Because of the sudden onset of the illness, he did not have time to leave a single word of testament. Zhou and Deng mourned deeply, and in the afternoon, they accompanied the body back to Nanjing. Overwhelmed by grief, they were unable to meet with General Marshall that day. Mr. Tao struggled throughout his life for the cause of people's democratic education, which had already damaged his health. Furthermore, the recent Lower Guan tragedy and the political assassinations of Li and Wen in Kunming occurred one after another, causing him excessive stimulation. In the days before his death, KMT secret agents suddenly went to his home to investigate his whereabouts, forcing him to live in a friend's house. On the eve of his death, he still disregarded his fatigue and talked to friends about the current situation. He eventually died of cerebral hemorrhage on the 25th due to excessive stimulation and fatigue.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th.

On another occasion when Chen Cheng was giving instructions, the same professor recited as before.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Moscow, 27th broadcast: Commentator Masinu, discussing the traditional friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, stated: On July 25, 1919, the young Soviet Russian government issued a declaration to the Chinese people proposing the abolition of all unequal treaties concluded between the Tsar and China. On September 27, 1920, the Soviet Russian government again proposed to the Chinese government the establishment of Sino-Soviet relations on the principles of complete equality and mutual respect. This aroused a sincere welcome from the Chinese people, and the revolutionary government led by Sun Yat-sen established relations with the Soviet Union. \"Alliance with Russia\" was one of Sun Yat-sen's three major policies. The Soviet Union has consistently been faithful to its policy of friendship towards the Chinese people. From 1925 to 1927, the Soviet Union provided spiritual and political assistance to the Chinese people. When Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China, the Soviet Union was the first to assist China, and it was the first country to conclude a treaty of friendship and alliance with China.\n    However, reactionaries inside and outside China did not want to see China become an independent, strong, happy, and free China. With the help of international imperialism, the Chinese reactionaries prepared to occupy the government for a long time. Negotiations with the Soviet Union were conducted under the pressure of democrats and agreements were signed with the Soviet Union out of necessity. From that time on, two lines appeared in China: one was the line advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, namely, the line of expanding Sino-Soviet friendly relations; the other was the line of the reactionaries, the line of Kuomintang warlords destroying Sino-Soviet friendly relations. The line implemented by the Chinese reactionaries was not to inherit the unfinished cause of Sun Yat-sen, but to complete the unfinished business of Japanese imperialism. The Chinese reactionaries attempted to use the anti-Soviet movement to cover up their conspiracy to undermine the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and provoke civil war in China. On the other hand, they also attempted to use the anti-Soviet movement to cover up their traitorous acts. They knew very well that they could not destroy China's broad democratic movement by relying on their own strength. Therefore, the Chinese reactionaries often relied on foreign reactionary forces, and one of their most important foreign pillars was Japanese imperialism. After Japan was defeated, the Chinese reactionaries lost an important pillar, so they tried to find a new international pillar. In order to obtain such support, the Chinese reactionaries did not hesitate to sell out all of China's territories, territorial waters, territorial airspace, and various privileges, and carried out anti-Soviet activities. In order to realize this determination, the Chinese reactionaries wantonly fabricated rumors and slandered the Soviet Union. For example, a certain newspaper of the Kuomintang reactionaries openly clamored for invading Siberia. What deserves the attention of the Chinese people is that the anti-Soviet conspiracy and the constant instigation of civil war by the Chinese reactionaries are carried out simultaneously.\n    The attitude towards the Soviet Union is the touchstone of who is a democrat, who is a reactionary, who is a follower of Sun Yat-sen, and who is a traitor to the Three People's Principles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努论中苏传统友谊\n\n1946-08-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努论中苏传统友谊\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】莫斯科二十七日广播：评论员马西努论中苏传统的友好关系称：一九一九年七月二十五日，年青的苏俄政府，向中国人民宣言提议取消沙皇与中国缔结的一切不平等条约。一九二○年九月二十七日，苏俄政府重新向中国政府提议在完全平等与相互尊重的原则上，建立中苏关系，这引起了中国人民的诚恳欢迎，孙中山领导的革命政府，便和苏联建立了关系。“联俄”是孙中山三大政策之一，苏联一贯忠实于对中国人民的亲善政策，一九二五——二七年，苏联曾在精神上与政治上援助中国人民；当日本大举进攻中国时，苏联首先援助中国，苏联并且是第一个与中国缔结友好同盟条约的国家。\n    但是，中国国内外的反动派，不愿看见中国成为独立强大幸福自由的中国，中国反动派在国际帝国主义帮助之下，准备长期盘据政府，与苏联进行谈判是在民主人士压迫之下进行的，迫不得已与苏联签订了协定。从那时起，在中国出现了两条路线，一条是孙中山先生赞成的路线，即扩大中苏友谊关系的路线；另一条是反动派的路线，是国民党军阀破坏中苏友谊关系的路线。中国反动派所实行的路线，不是继承孙中山未竟的事业，而是在完成日本帝国主义所未完成的勾当。中国反动派曾企图利用反苏运动掩盖其破坏政协决议，挑拨中国内战的阴谋，另一方面亦企图以反苏运动掩盖其卖国行为。他们深知依赖其本身力量不能摧毁中国广大的民主运动，因此中国反动派经常依靠外国的反动势力，其最重要的外国支柱之一，即日本帝国主义。在日本被击溃之后，中国反动派便丧失了一重要支柱，因此它力图找到新的国际支柱。为获得此种支援，中国反动派不惜出卖一切中国的领土、领海、领空等各种特权，并进行反苏。中国反动派为实现这种决心，又大肆造谣诽谤苏联，如国民党反动派的某机关报，曾公开狂言侵入西伯利亚。值得引起中国人民注意的，是反苏勾当与中国反动派的经常挑拨内战是同时进行的。\n    对苏态度，是谁是民主主义者、谁是反动派、谁是孙中山的信徒、谁是三民主义的叛徒之试金石。"

This conference is of great significance. Although consensus has been reached on the majority of issues, some issues remain to be resolved.

The twenty-one countries participating in the conference have every possibility to complete the second stage of the preparatory treaties, and to overcome newly encountered difficulties. Parisian newspapers are paying great attention to the conference, pointing out that disagreements seem likely to occur between large and small powers regarding the formulation of the final provisions of the treaties.

Following the Taihang Third Middle School in Zuoquan, the people of Xiangyuan County have also launched a fundraising campaign. When villagers, schools, and reading groups in the first and third districts discussed this issue, the masses said, \"We are one family in the liberated areas. If the reactionaries want to eliminate them, they also want to eliminate us. We cannot ignore them.\" The donation campaign immediately spread throughout the county. An old woman in a village in the morning said, \"We are all people who have turned over and stood up. If they are in trouble, we must help them. I will donate a斗 (dǒu - a unit of dry measure, about 10 liters) of millet.\" Currently, in the first and third districts alone, more than 259,000 yuan and more than 5,500 jin of grain have been donated. Soon, the donations from the entire county will be collected and sent to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Relief Branch.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: On the 10th of this month, twenty-one civilian boats fully loaded with relief medicines, weighing 140 tons, dispatched by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), were detained by a crowd of so-called \"Northern Jiangsu refugees\" instigated by the Kuomintang, and were not allowed to pass.\n    Heze, 30th: Our reporter recently made a special visit to Mr. Ma Chongmin, head of the general affairs group, and Mr. Li Zuyuan, head of the business group of the CRRRA office in Heze, regarding the Central News Agency's Xuzhou dispatch that 6,000 bags of relief flour stored in Heze by the CRRRA were looted by the Communist army. According to them: \"The Henan branch transported 9,200 large bags and 169,516 small bags of flour to Heze. Except for 3,946 large bags and 129,510 small bags that have been issued as wages for river management workers, all the rest are stored in the warehouse.\" Mr. Ma and Mr. Li solemnly told the reporter: \"We can completely confirm that there was no looting incident, and this office has never reported such a thing to the branch.\" It should be noted that the Kuomintang authorities have repeatedly delayed the supply guaranteed in the Nanjing Agreement. For the engineering wages alone, the liberated area's first phase of the project has consumed 8,800 tons, while the Kuomintang side has only transported 4,145 tons, less than 50%. The gap is even greater for other materials and construction funds. The Central News Agency is fabricating rumors out of thin air, clearly attempting to cover up its crime of reneging on the Nanjing Agreement and hindering river management.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行捐款救济  冀鲁豫河道灾胞 国民党扣留救资中央社凭空造谣\n\n1946-08-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行捐款救济\n    冀鲁豫河道灾胞\n    国民党扣留救资中央社凭空造谣\n    【本报讯】太行人民对国民党反动派破坏南京协议迟不救济黄河故道沿岸人民咸表愤慨，并纷纷自动捐款，救济冀鲁豫沿河同胞。继左权太行第三中学之后，襄垣全县人民亦展开募捐运动。在一、三两区各村民校读报讨论这一问题时，群众说：“咱解放区是一家，反动派要消灭他们，也就是要消灭我们，咱不能不管”。捐募运动立即普及全县。上午村一个老太太说：“咱们都是翻了身的人，他们遇了难，咱们要招呼，咱捐一斗小米”。现仅一三两区，已捐款二十五万九千余元，粮食五千五百余斤，不日即将会集全县捐款，汇往冀鲁豫救济分会。\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】行总本月十日下午，派往淮阴满载救济药品之民船二十一只，重一百四十吨，为国民党嗾使之所谓“苏北难民”聚众扣留，不予放行。\n    【荷泽三十日电】本社记者顷特就中央社徐州电所谓行总存荷泽救济面粉被共军抢去六千袋一事，往访行总驻荷办事处总务组长马重民、业务组长李祖原二先生，据称：“河南分署运抵荷泽面粉九千二百大袋、十六万九千五百一十六小袋，除已发出治河工粮三千九百四十六大袋、十二万九千五百一十小袋外，余均全数存仓。”马李二先生郑重告记者：“我们完全可以证实绝无所谓抢劫事件发生，且本处亦从未向分署作过此类报告”。按国民党当局对南京协议中所保证之供给一再拖延，仅工粮一项，解放区第一期工程已耗去八千八百吨，而国民党方面仅运来四千一百四十五吨，不及百分之五十，他如器材工款等相差更甚，中央社凭空捏造谣言，显图掩饰其背弃南京协议，阻碍治河之罪行。"

Comrade Muhan comes from a prominent family in southern Chahar and is currently 45 years old. In his early years, he graduated from the潞河中学 (Luhe Middle School) in Tongzhou. Witnessing the poverty and bankruptcy of farmers in his hometown, he left in anger to study in Japan, hoping to find a way to save the country from danger. After returning to China in 1931, he served as a professor at universities such as Peking, Northeast, and Franco-Chinese University. At that time, he deeply felt that the CCP's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary cause was in line with justice, and he resolutely participated in revolutionary work, regardless of danger. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, he has felt even more deeply the extreme suffering and enormous contributions of the peasants, and he sincerely supports Chairman Mao's land reform policy proposed in the Report on the Coalition Government. Since this spring, he has repeatedly written to his friend, Mr. Ruan Baozhen, to discuss the donation of land. Mr. Baozhen, deeply understanding the great righteousness, is willing to contribute to this righteous cause. Comrade Muhan then went to his hometown in the latter half of this month and, together with his uncle, convened a mass meeting in Chaigoubu on July 23rd. At the meeting, he generously announced that, in addition to retaining a small portion for self-cultivation, he was willing to distribute all of his land to poor farmers for cultivation without compensation, and earnestly urged the villagers to step up production and live frugally. The farmers in the audience burst into thunderous applause, warmly welcoming this righteous act. The enlightened gentry present at the meeting were also moved and expressed their willingness to follow suit. After the meeting, Comrade Muhan immediately reported his land to the Sixth Commissioner's Office for distribution in conjunction with the local farmers' association. After receiving the report from the local Party committee, the CCP Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau sent a letter to Comrade Ruan Muhan to congratulate him, stating: \"This further proves your revolutionary personality of serving the people wholeheartedly and sacrificing everything for the people since you dedicated yourself to the revolution and joined our Party. We will call on this part of the Party members who have moved from the landlord class to the proletarian position to learn from you.\" The Border Region Farmers' Association also issued instructions, representing the 30 million farmers in the entire Border Region, expressing warm support for this exemplary action, and calling on farmers to provide more economic care to political and civilian cadres and enlightened landlords who voluntarily donate land, so that the people of the Border Region can be more closely united and work together to develop the economy of the liberated areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 察哈尔高等法院院长  阮慕韩献田三千余亩  中共晋察冀中央局号召出身地主阶级的党员向阮学习\n\n1946-08-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　察哈尔高等法院院长\n    阮慕韩献田三千余亩         \n    中共晋察冀中央局号召出身地主阶级的党员向阮学习\n    【新华社宣化二十九日电】察哈尔省高等法院院长中共党员阮慕韩同志，顷自动将怀安原籍田产三千二百余亩，献交贫苦农民耕种。慕韩同志出身察南望族，现年四十五岁，早年曾毕业于通州潞河中学，因目睹家乡农民贫困破产的苦况，愤然出走赴日本留学，期望专求挽救祖国危亡的道路。一九三一年回国后，历任北平东北中法等大学教授，因当时深切体验中共反帝反封建革命事业合于正义，不避危难毅然参加革命工作。抗战以来，更深感农民所受痛苦至剧，所做贡献至巨，对毛主席论联合政府报告中提出的土地改革政策，更竭诚拥护。今春以来，曾屡函乃友阮葆忱先生商议献田之事，葆忱先生深明大义，愿共襄义举。慕韩同志遂于本月下旬到乡，协同叔父于七月二十三日在柴沟堡召集群众大会，当场慷慨宣布除留少部自耕外，愿将全部土地无代价分给贫苦农民耕种，且殷切嘱咐乡亲们加紧生产，勤俭持家。全场农民掌声雷动，热烈欢迎这一义举。与会各开明士绅亦受感动，表示愿追随其后。会后幕韩同志即将其土地报请第六专员公署会同当地农会分配。中共晋察冀中央局接获当地党委报告后，即致函阮慕韩同志奖贺内称：“这是进一步证明了你献身革命加入我党以来一贯为人民服务不惜牺牲自己一切的革命人格，我们将号召由地主阶级转到无产阶级立场上的这一部分党员向你学习”。边区农会也发表指示，代表全边区三千万农民对这一模范行动表示热烈拥护，并号召农民对自动献田的政民干部、开明地主等，应在经济上多加照顾，使边区人民更臻于亲密团结，合力发展解放区经济。"

At the end of June, the county held a county-wide meeting of activists and made a deep self-criticism, explicitly proposing the policy of uniting the entire peasant class to attack the feudal groups, and a large-scale liquidation movement was re-launched. In just fifteen days to mid-July, a total of 69 villages had been mobilized, and 102 villages were in the process of taking action or brewing. Because the issue of unity between middle and poor peasants was resolved, the broad middle peasants participated in the movement, and in many villages, more than 80% of households participated in the struggle, involving more than 100,000 people. In Fucheng, 840 out of 932 households participated in complaining and liquidation. The peasant associations have been universally expanded in the movement, and the broad middle peasants have actively participated. According to statistics from 32 villages, the peasant association members have newly developed 3,377 households, and 943 new activists have emerged. Under the powerful strength of the unity of middle and poor peasants, the feudal groups that were not completely crushed in the previous movement were crushed, and many traitors, secret agents, and landlord bullies bowed their heads and admitted their past exploitation crimes in the face of the mighty peasant masses, saying that they were \"dark-hearted\" and \"enriched themselves by killing poor people.\" In Fucheng, seven or eight hundred people demanded all 16,000 shi of grain that should be returned in two days and one night.

Many important market towns and villages have been recovered, and the invading troops' ferocious advance has been halted. They have now retreated to a narrow area along the railway. In southern Shanxi: On the 21st, a regiment of the Chiang army's 78th Division, which had occupied Songdian Station southwest of Wenxi, attacked the Eighth Route Army in Songcun village south of Wenxi under the cover of five aircraft. The 47th Division, stationed at Guodian Station, also attacked the Eighth Route Army defenses in Zhongjin and Xijin southwest of Wenxi. After fierce fighting, both attacking forces were completely defeated. On the 22nd, the Yan army, which had occupied Dongcheng in Quwo, continued to advance southwest, attempting to capture Gaoxian Station. They were repelled by the Eighth Route Army, which then seized the opportunity to recover Dongcheng and the surrounding areas of Bei＠ and Anding to the southeast.

The Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense and completely defeated them, and Baohe, Wangguo and other places were subsequently recovered. On the 23rd, the defeated Yan army's 44th Division, after receiving reinforcements, launched a fierce attack on Hongshan, Liujiashan, Songbi and other places (all northeast of Jiexiu). The Eighth Route Army counterattacked village by village, inflicting heavy losses on the Yan army. That night, they fled back to Jiexiu city in a panic. At the same time, the Yan army occupying Dongquan Town and Yuebi in Pingyao were also repelled by the local masses and the Eighth Route Army in self-defense, and these areas have also been recovered.

    "author": "Siyuan",
    "date": "1946-08-02",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "(This dispatch from Yangcheng) Jincheng has recently gained some urban work experience, which is introduced below: (1) Some time ago, merchants in Jincheng had \"three fears\" in their minds: First, they feared that the farmers' struggle would damage the interests of their shops and workshops. Second, they feared that state-owned shops would squeeze them out of business. Third, they feared that shop assistants and clerks would settle old scores. These thoughts hindered commercial development. Shop assistants and clerks were also afraid of bankrupting their employers and losing their jobs. To this end, the Chengguan District Office convened a symposium with representatives of more than 260 shops in the city to discuss the matter. At the meeting, encouraged by the government, merchants put forward these concerns, and the government immediately put forward three guarantees and requirements: First, it guaranteed that the peasant movement would not harm the interests of industrialists and businessmen except for rent and interest reduction. At the same time, merchants were required to automatically resolve the issue of rent and interest with farmers. Second, it guaranteed the abolition of the special rights of state-owned shops, and at the same time required private shops to change their practices of \"harming others to benefit oneself, hoarding and speculating\" to \"benefiting oneself and others, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, and taking profit with benevolence.\" Third, it guaranteed that shop assistants and apprentices would not settle old scores, and at the same time required shopkeepers not to illegally treat or fire shop assistants and apprentices. After discussion, it was decided to establish a chamber of commerce to resolve disputes between merchants and farmers through mediation. (2) What to do after the urban masses were liberated was a very troubling issue for the leadership in the past. The city had no land to organize mutual aid in production, and the industries of the poor people were complex and scattered. Because they could not find a direction for a while, some people developed the phenomenon of idleness, heavy eating and drinking, and wasting the fruits of struggle. Recently, after discussions among the masses in various streets, they found a way to develop small-scale cooperative handicraft workshops, organizing former millers, musicians, wet nurses, etc., to form various small workshops or groups for spinning, wool spinning, saltpeter boiling, flour milling, etc., which have now begun to operate. (3) Because landlords in the city compensated farmers for losses with houses, citizens who originally lived in landlords' houses had housing problems. In West Street, out of 500 households, 200 households were facing housing panic. After consultation with the Farmers' Association, it was decided to temporarily handle the matter according to the following two principles: A. If the houses originally belonged to local tyrants, landlords, temples, or communities and had been inhabited by poor people or small merchants for more than 30 years, they would be distributed to the residents without compensation and become private property. B. If the houses originally belonged to general landlords and had been inhabited by ordinary citizens for less than 30 years, the residents could buy them at a low price.

    "content": "News Bulletin Observer\n    Criticizes US Policy Toward Japan\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th] TASS, Moscow, 28th: The News Bulletin's diplomatic observer criticized US policy toward Japan, stating: The Potsdam Declaration, regarding the section on Japan, stipulated that the Allied powers should provide all assistance to Japanese organizations attempting to democratize the country. Based on this promise, the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan proposed the implementation of labor legislation in Japan (which advocated for the basic rights of Japanese laborers). The US representative, Acheson, completely illogically stated that there was \"communist propaganda\" in the Soviet proposal. To prove Acheson's shallowness, the Soviet delegation to the Allied Council for Japan held a press conference to explain the Soviet proposal on labor legislation in detail to Allied and Japanese journalists in order to eliminate any attempts to distort the proposal, which was an absolutely legitimate attitude. However, according to the Tokyo correspondent of the New York Times, General MacArthur was extremely angry about the recent reception held by the Soviet mission because the occupation authorities' policies regarding labor legislation were criticized at the meeting. It is strange that MacArthur's anger was only directed at the representative of an Allied power with equal control rights, while certain other facts that clearly violate the Potsdam Declaration and the terms of Japan's surrender did not arouse the anger of the US occupation authorities. The meeting of the Allied Council on July 10th elicited lively commentary from Japanese newspapers under US control, such as the Yomiuri Shimbun, which even suggested that the rights of members of the Allied Council might be discussed. It also pointed out that Prime Minister Yoshida and his colleagues were using this session of the Japanese Diet to attempt to revise the basic principles of Japan's surrender. It is strange that the Japanese militarists did not arouse the anger of the US occupation authorities. Furthermore, at the Allied Council on July 24th, the Soviet Union urged that fascist books, especially Hitler's \"Mein Kampf,\" should be banned, but the US occupation authorities came out to protect the so-called \"freedom of thought and speech\" of Japanese reactionaries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 消息报观察家  抨击美国对日政策\n\n1946-08-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　消息报观察家\n    抨击美国对日政策\n    【新华社延安二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：消息报外交观察家抨击美国对日政策称：波茨顿宣言关于日本部分，曾规定盟国关于企图使日本民主化的该国社团予以一切援助，盟国对日委员会苏联代表曾根据这种诺言，提出在日本实行劳工立法的提案（该提案主张规定日本劳工的基本权利），美国代表艾契森完全违反逻辑，说在苏联的提案中“有共产主义的宣传”。为了证明艾契森的浅薄，盟国对日委员会苏联代表曾举行记者招待会，向盟国及日本记者详细解释苏联关于劳工立法的提案，以便消除一切对该提案曲解的企图，这是绝对正当的态度。但是，据纽约时报东京记者称：麦克阿瑟将军对于苏联使团最近举行的招待会，极为愤怒，因为在这次会上，占领当局关于劳工立法方面的政策，曾受到批评。很奇怪的是麦氏的这种愤怒，仅仅是针对着与美国有同等管制权的盟国代表而发，然而另外某些显然违反波茨顿宣言及日本投降条款的事实，却没有激起美国占领当局的愤怒。盟国委员会七月十日的会议，引起了美国控制下的日本报纸的生动评论，如读卖新闻甚至认为可能要讨论对日委员会委员的权利，同时也指出首相吉田以及他的同僚，正利用这一届日本议会，企图修改日本投降的基本原则。很奇怪的，是日本的军阀们并没有引起美国占领当局的愤怒。此外，在七月二十四日的盟国委员会上，苏联曾敦促法西斯书籍、特别是希特勒的“我的奋斗”应加禁绝，而美国占领当局却又出来保护日本反动分子的所谓“思想与言论自由”了。"

After the plaintiff, Jin Zuo, presented conclusive evidence and the masses conducted lengthy questioning and verification, the two traitors confessed to all their criminal activities. Xu Bingwen was from the South Gate of the county and had served the enemy as a military policeman and secret agent, framing many anti-Japanese masses and cadres. After Cixian County was liberated last year, he fled to Anyang, colluded with the special agent leader Wu Jinren, and organized the \"Vanguard of Revenge,\" sneaking back to Cixian County to carry out activities. He once impersonated the Eighth Route Army, robbing and kidnapping, and capturing our personnel. However, his main conspiracy was to threaten villages with rumors of a change of regime, demanding \"connections\" and \"maintenance,\" and extorting money from them. Last month, he extorted 8,000 yuan (customs gold) in Wanzi Village. Zhang Risheng, the former puppet township chief of the village, also assisted in the activities. In addition to being the first to pay Wanzi's \"maintenance fee,\" he also assigned 10,000 yuan each to villages such as Nanguan, Moli, Shitougou, and Balizhong. Xu and his gang of traitors stayed at Zhang's house every time they came to collect the money. Sometimes, Zhang would bring in \"connections\" from other villages to urge payment. These criminal activities were captured by us on the 17th of last month.\n　　At the end of the public trial, the secretary of the county government called on the masses to organize, be highly vigilant, and smash the encroachment and secret maintenance activities of the traitors and National Party special agents, and defend the liberated area of Cixian County. After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration. Xu and Zhang were executed by firing squad on the outskirts of Nanguan when the demonstrating masses arrived, amidst the thunderous slogans of \"Eliminate special agents!\"\n　　(Xie Tongguan, Jiang Feng, Wang Dazhi)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 磁县国特许丙文潜入活动暗维持  经群众公审后枪决\n谢童关　江风　王大知\n1946-08-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　磁县国特许丙文潜入活动暗维持\n    经群众公审后枪决\n    【本报讯】磁县群众六千人于上月二十一日上午集会县文庙内，公审活动暗维持、破坏解放区的汉奸特务许丙文、张日生。大会经过原告由金佐证据确凿的起诉与群众长时间的质问与对证，二逆乃承认其全部罪恶活动，许丙文是该县南关人，曾给敌人当过宪兵、密探，陷害过许多抗日群众与干部，去年磁县解放后，逃到安阳，与特务头子武金仁勾结，组织“雪耻先锋队”，潜回磁县活动。曾冒充八路军，劫路绑票，捕捉我工作人员。但其主要阴谋计划，则是以变天谣言威胁各村“接头”、“维持”，给他们出款，上月份即在湾子村勒索八千元（关金）。该村前伪乡长张日生也帮助活动，除首先出清湾子的“维持款”外，并向南关、磨里、石头沟、八里冢等村各派一万元。许逆与其奸群每次来催款，都住在张家。有时由张将外村特务“关系”找来催索，这些罪恶活动于上月十七日为我捕获。\n    公审大会结束时，县政府秘书号召群众组织起来，严重警惕并击碎汉奸国特的蚕食与暗维持活动，保卫磁县解放区。会后，群众举行示威游行。许、张二逆在示威群众到达南关郊外时，被枪决于震天的“肃清特务”口号声中。\n    （谢童关、江风、王大知）"

    "title": "Magnetic County Mass Movement Experience",
    "author": "Ci County Joint Office",
    "date": "1946-08-02",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Magnetic County Mass Movement Experience\n    Ci County Joint Office\n    Magnetic County has gained a lot of experience in the mass movement of the past six months. It is introduced below for reference by various regions.\n    I. The Direction of the Movement\n\n    The main characteristics of the new district are that feudal landlords, combined with remnants of enemy puppets, cruelly rule and exploit the masses. Therefore, anti-traitorism and rent reduction are equally urgent demands of the masses. However, experience has proven that starting with rent reduction often fails to mobilize the broad masses. Starting with anti-traitorism and combining it with rent reduction and wage increases mobilizes the most widely, the fastest, and the most powerfully. It can strike at the main leaders of traitors, local bullies, and landlords at once, and also makes it easy to thoroughly carry out the rent reduction movement. However, three points need to be grasped: First, the target of struggle should preferably be the main figures who combine traitorism, bullying, and feudal landlordism to rule a village or several villages. Second, win over the running dogs to expand and organize the mass camp; but this must be combined with striking at the landlords; isolated efforts are ineffective. Third, always pay attention to cultivating poor and hired peasant backbones. A major lesson is that many villages were seized by hooligans, running dogs, or puppet personnel who strangled the movement because of the lack of such backbones.\n    II. Leadership Support, Mass Support, and Joint Struggle\n\n    Leading cadres should boldly support the demands of the masses and encourage them to rise up and struggle; at the same time, advanced masses help backward masses, and advanced villages help backward villages. In particular, the assistance of armed militia often plays a significant role. This is mass support. Many backward villages have launched struggles in this way.\n    Based on the peasants' class integrity—the ideological awareness that \"all peasants under heaven are one family\"—and the understanding that \"unity is strength,\" they automatically collude and jointly organize several villages or even the entire district to struggle against a common target in a certain village. The struggle method is often very intense. We should not be afraid or restrict it, but should actively lead and help, because this method can quickly make the masses realize their own strength and strengthen their fighting spirit and confidence in victory. At the same time, it is a powerful suppression of the sabotage activities of landlords and special agents. The landlord in Beilai Village had already prepared a riot, but it was stopped by the news of the joint struggle of the entire district against ×××. However, this kind of joint struggle should rely on the masses' voluntary and automatic collusion, and should not be monopolized or ordered by the masses to unite.\n    III. Arming Up and Overcoming the \"Change of Sky\" Mentality\n\n    From secret collusion and complaining to arming oneself and then to open struggle action is the process of the Magnetic County peasants' awakening, and arming oneself is an important key. Due to the black gun threats of traitors, special agents, bullies, and landlords, and being close to the ruling areas of the Jiang puppet army, the masses generally demanded to confiscate the landlords' weapons and arm themselves after secret collusion and complaining. The leadership resolutely helped the masses realize this demand, which greatly enhanced the masses' fighting spirit and promoted the development of the movement from secret to open, overcoming the \"change of sky\" mentality of fearing the return of the Jiang puppet army and fearing black guns, which once existed seriously.\n    The mass armed forces do not necessarily have to be called militia at the beginning, because the masses are not used to it or have misunderstandings. As long as the masses voluntarily take up weapons to defend themselves, and after several organized actions, they gradually become militia, and they are very consolidated.\n    IV. Activists and Leading Backbone\n\n    The movement can only move forward rapidly, and the leadership can only let go, if there is a group of activists who truly serve the people and leading backbones generated from the masses. When we first arrive in an area to work, those who are most likely to approach us are mostly fugitive soldiers, veterans, or people who have some relationship with us during the Anti-Japanese War. These people do not necessarily have connections with the masses, and some have hooliganism and are slippery. Their work is mostly an official attitude. These need to be transformed in the mass movement. The leadership is determined to go deep into the masses to discover and cultivate backbones who truly connect with the masses. General experience has proven that the activists who are the most oppressed, poor, hardworking, and dare to speak and act, discovered in complaining, are the best activists and can be quickly cultivated into leading backbones.\n    V. Ideological Leadership and Internal Problems of Peasants\n\n    Ideological leadership can generally be divided into two issues: mobilizing the masses to rise up and struggle, and grasping the ideological situation and conducting education at any time during the action. Experience has proven that it is necessary to understand the most specific pains and sorrows (regardless of big or small) of each mass in deep contact with the masses, accurately grasp the motivation and stimulation, and guide them to complain, settle accounts, and find the root of poverty, in order to make the masses distinguish class boundaries and resolutely rise up to struggle. Only the arousal of \"anger\" can truly make the masses fight regardless of life and death. At this point, the \"change of sky\" mentality is completely resolved.\n    After the movement rises, pay attention to anti-internal traitors and the swaying of individual cadres, so that they do not affect the entire camp. The Second District held a large-scale meeting of activists, launched the anti-Zhu Weixin struggle, exposed his crimes of accepting bribes and letting go of the bully landlord Wang Hongxun, and launched the \"Zhu Weixin Thought\" inspection movement, which played a major role in consolidating the camp.\n    After the climax of the movement, it is necessary to prevent the landlords from counterattacking and internal disputes. The Second District proposed \"Everyone joins hands, villages jointly defend, dig out all rotten meat, and eliminate bad seeds\" to prevent counterattacks. During the deep movement, it proposed \"Three no remainings\" (one does not leave a person suffering, two does not leave a problem, three does not leave a backward mass), which all played a role in consolidating the peasant camp.\n    The internal problems of peasants are mainly the unity of middle and poor peasants and the distribution of the fruits of struggle.\n    At the beginning of the Ci County mass movement, poor peasants and hired peasants first joined the peasant association, without middle peasants, thinking that they had a relationship with the landlords, so they only absorbed middle peasants to participate in the movement during large movements, but were unwilling to absorb them to participate in the peasant association. In some areas, middle peasants joined the peasant association, but poor and hired peasants held their own secret peasant associations, and they were still not united. This has created an unfavorable situation where landlords win over middle peasants and counterattack poor peasants. Generally, middle peasants dare not rely on landlords and rich peasants (fear of struggle), and they also cannot rely on the peasant association, feeling distressed. Each district has accumulated some experience in solving this problem. In summary, it is to improve the peasants' class integrity and the awareness of the consistency of interests, so that poor peasants realize that their fate is the same as that of middle peasants, and the truth that they cannot win without uniting middle peasants. Then, \"dig out the heart disease\" and \"untie the knot\" for the middle peasants, tell them that middle peasants are also basic masses, explain our policy of never infringing on the interests of middle peasants, and appropriately give benefits. Absorbing them to participate in the struggle, participate in the peasant association, and select resolute elements to participate in leadership and become cadres are all effective methods.\n    The issue of distributing the fruits of struggle should grasp the principles of \"democracy and speed.\" As long as it is discussed by the masses and everyone's opinions are generally consistent, it can be distributed immediately, without being too particular about \"scientific\" methods: such as detailed grading, etc., the masses are not used to it, and it is not rewarding. The Second District first generally discussed it with cadres and activists, then decided by the masses, and immediately distributed it, generally grasping the principle of \"masses first, cadres later,\" and proposed four essentials (to be fast, to be thorough, to be democratic, and to be fair); corrected the phenomenon of misusing the fruits and treating the fruits as foreign wealth. When the Third District distributed, it proposed \"comparing merits,\" recognizing that the victory of the struggle was the merit of the masses, not the merit of a certain person, but attention should be paid to taking care of the militia and anti-family members, and inspiring the masses to automatically care for them.\n    VI. Raiding Backward Villages\n\n    Most of the backward villages after the climax of the movement are feudal bully or special agent fortresses. The rulers have counter-revolutionary experience, use running dogs and hooligans, or buy off activists who originally had relations with us, and implement the \"security leader policy\": using our organizational forms, they place the leaders they control in each department, such as the chairman of the peasant association. The rulers implement false enlightenment, \"support\" the land to some poor people, buy people's hearts, and suppress the struggle; or struggle against one or two bad people who are not in harmony with them, so that the masses gain some benefits, and then promote \"there is no problem in our village anymore.\" Some incite middle peasants and poor peasants to struggle indiscriminately, actually to divert attention and suppress the peasants. In addition, some villages simply do not move. To open up the situation in these villages, the only key is to destroy the ruling group's \"security leader policy.\" Implement mass review and cleaning, remove bad elements, clear obstacles to the movement, and organize the masses to struggle against the rulers.\n    When opening up, it is necessary to use the masses of advanced villages to support, and some need to use armed cover to ensure the safety of working comrades and the masses who have just emerged. At any time, expose the rulers' conspiracies to isolate cadres from the masses, incite mutual struggles between the masses of this village and other villages, and spread rumors and threats to the masses, so that the masses of this village, the masses of other villages, and the leading cadres can be combined into a three-in-one whole, so that the situation can be opened up smoothly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 磁县群运经验\n磁县联合办公室\n1946-08-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　磁县群运经验\n    磁县联合办公室\n    磁县在最近半年的群众运动中，取得不少经验。特介绍于下，供各地参考。\n    一、运动的方向问题\n    新区主要特点是封建地主结合敌伪残余，残酷的统治压榨群众，所以反奸与减租同样是群众的迫切要求。但经验证明，先搞减租多半发动不了广大群众；先搞反奸并与减租增资结合进行，发动的最广泛，最快，最有力量，能一下打击到汉奸恶霸地主身上，也容易使减租运动搞得彻底。但需要掌握三点：第一、斗争对象，最好选择汉奸、恶霸与封建地主结合一体统治一村或数村的主要头子。第二、争取走狗，扩大与整齐群众阵营；但必须与打击地主结合；孤立争取则无效。第三、时刻注意培养贫雇农骨干，好些村因无此骨干而被流氓、走狗或伪人员窃取了领导，绞杀了运动，是一个很大的教训。\n    二、领导上的支援、群众的支援、联合斗争\n    领导干部要大胆支持群众的要求，鼓舞群众起来斗争；同时，先进群众帮助落后群众，先进村帮助落后村，特别是武装民兵的帮助，也经常起着很大作用，这就是群众的支援。许多落后村曾这样掀起斗争。\n    基于农民的阶级整体性——“天下农民是一家”的思想觉悟，以及“联合起来力量大”的认识，他们自动串通，自动联合若干村以至全区到某一村去斗争一个共同的对象时，斗争方式时常是很剧烈的，我们不应该害怕或限制，而应该积极去领导、帮助，因为这种方式能使群众很快认识自身力量，坚定斗志与胜利信心。同时也是对地主特务们的破坏活动，有力的镇压。北来村地主已经准备好了的暴动，是被全区群众对×××联合斗争的消息吓得停止了的。但这种联合斗争，应该依靠群众的自愿与自动串通，不能包办或命令群众联合。\n    三、武装起来与变天思想的克服\n    由秘密串通、诉苦到武装自己、再到公开斗争行动，是磁县农民觉悟的过程，而武装自己是一个重要的关键。由于汉奸特务恶霸地主们的黑枪威胁与靠近蒋伪军统治区，群众在秘密串通诉苦后，一般都要求收缴地主武器，武装自己。领导上坚决帮助群众实现了这一要求，曾大大增强了群众斗志，推动了运动由秘密到公开的发展，克服了曾经严重存在的怕蒋伪军再来与怕黑枪的变天思想。\n    群众武装，一开始不一定叫民兵，因为群众不习惯，或有误解。只要群众自愿的拿起武器保卫自己，并经过几次有组织的行动，逐渐都变成了民兵，而且很巩固。\n    四、积极分子与领导骨干\n    必须有一批真正为人民服务的积极分子与群众中产生的领导骨干，运动才能迅速前进，领导上也才能放得开手。我们初到一个地区工作时，首先容易与我们接近的，多是逃亡战士，退伍军人，或与我们在抗战时期有点关系的人，这些人不一定与群众有联系，有些有流氓性，滑头，工作多是办公事态度，这些需在群运中加以改造，领导上决心深入群众，发现与培养真正联系群众的骨干。一般经验证明：在诉苦中发现的最受压迫、贫苦勤劳、敢说敢干的积极分子，是最好的积极分子，可以很快培养成领导骨干。\n    五、思想领导与农民内部问题\n    思想领导，一般可分为鼓动群众起来斗争，和在行动中掌握思想情况并随时进行教育等两个问题。经验证明，必须在与群众深刻的接触中了解各个群众最具体的痛苦与伤心事（不管大事小事），抓准进行鼓动激发，引导其诉苦、算账、找穷根，才能使群众分清阶级界线，坚决起来斗争。也只有“愤火”的激起，才能真正使群众不顾生死去斗争。到了这步田地，变天思想也就彻底解决了。\n    运动起来以后，要注意反内奸与个别干部的摇摆，使其不影致响整个阵营。二区召开大规模的积极分子会议，展开反朱维新斗争，揭发其受贿放跑恶霸地主王鸿勋的罪恶，并展开“朱维新思想”检查运动，曾在巩固阵营上起了很大作用。\n    运动高潮过后，要防止地主反攻与内部纠纷。二区为防止反攻而提出“人人联手，村村联防、挖尽烂肉，肃清坏种”，深入运动时提出“三不留”（一不留一个受痛苦的人，二不留一个问题，三不留一个落后群众），这些都曾起了巩固农民阵营的作用。\n    农民内部问题，主要是中贫农团结与分配斗争果实两个问题。\n    磁县群运开始，贫农与雇农先参加了农会，不要中农，认为他们和地主有关系，所以只在大运动时吸收中农参加运动，而不肯吸收参加农会。有些地区中农参加了农会，但贫雇农另外自己召开秘密农会，还是团结不好。曾造成地主拉拢中农、反攻贫农的不利形势，一般中农不敢靠地主富农（怕斗），同样靠不上农会，感到苦闷。各区在解决这问题上，一般都积累了一些经验。概括说来，则是提高农民阶级整体性，利害一致性的自觉，使贫农认识自己与中农的命运是相同的，以及不团结中农不能胜利的道理。然后给中农“挖心病”，“解疙瘩”，告诉他们中农也是基本群众，解释我们决不侵犯中农利益的政策，并适当给予利益。吸收其参加斗争，参加农会，选其中坚决分子参加领导，当干部，都是有效办法。\n    分配斗争果实问题，要掌握“民主、迅速”的原则，只要经过群众讨论，大家意见大体一致，就可以马上分，不必过于讲究“科学的”办法：如详细的分等分级等，群众也不习惯，出力不讨好。二区是先经干部积极分子大体讨论好，再经群众决定，马上就分，一般掌握了“先群众、后干部”的原则，并提出了四要（要快、要尽，要民主，要公平）；纠正了乱用果实，把果实当外财的现象。三区分配时，提出“比功劳”，认识斗争胜利是群众的功劳，不是某个人的功劳，但应注意照顾民兵与抗属，启发群众自动爱护他们。\n    六、突击落后村\n    运动高潮过后的落后村，大部是封建恶霸或特务堡垒，统治者有反革命经验，利用走狗、流氓或收买原来与我们有关系的积极分子，实行了“安头政策”：利用我们的组织形式，每部门都安置了他们掌握的头目，如农会主席等。统治者实行假开明，“拥护”土地给部分穷人，收买人心，抑制斗争；或斗争一两个与他们不睦的坏人，使群众获得一点利益，即宣传“我村再没问题了”。有的是鼓动中农贫农乱斗争，实际是转移视线、镇压农民。另外有些村，则干脆一动不动，要想打开这些村的局面，唯一关键是摧毁统治集团的安头政策。实行群众性的审查清洗，去掉坏分子，扫除运动障碍，组织群众向统治者斗争。\n    开辟时要用先进村群众去支援，有的要用武装掩护，使工作同志与刚抬头的群众获得安全。随时揭发统治者隔绝干部与群众，挑拨本村与外村群众互斗，以及对群众造谣威胁等阴谋，使本村群众、外村群众、领导干部能三位一体结合起来，才能顺利打开局面。"

They even assassinated leaders of the intellectual community. Those participating in democratic organizations and advocating democratic movements have been subjected to their destruction. Now the warmongers are launching a larger civil war. Swin continued: If a coalition government is not formed with the Communist Party and other political parties, a larger civil war will brew. He advocated that once a formal civil war breaks out, US troops must immediately leave China. Swin concluded: The CCP has gained the approval of the broad masses of the people, and the CCP will surely win.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 30th. Mr. Ya Fu (pseudonym), a famous lawyer from Beiping, recently traveled to the Hebei-Shanxi Liberated Area. Before leaving, he specially wrote an article for the Hebei-Shanxi Daily to express his impressions: What is absolutely unseen and has disappeared in the liberated area are \"corrupt officials, local bullies,\" \"escaped traitors,\" \"foreign goods filling the market,\" \"idle loafers,\" \"prostitutes, gamblers,\" \"illiterate people under the age of thirty,\" \"barren fields,\" \"torture and abuse,\" \"adulterous daughters-in-law, beggars,\" \"wandering monks and heretical religions,\" \"people in strange costumes parading the streets,\" and more than a dozen other items. What exists can be summarized as \"politics being simple, convenient, and fair, promoting civil rights,\" \"officials and soldiers being gentle and considerate to people,\" \"daily necessities being manufactured locally,\" \"nothing being picked up from the road, doors not being closed at night,\" \"newspapers being popular, freedom of speech,\" \"men plowing and women weaving, having work to do,\" \"the military and the people being one, officials and the people joining hands, truly becoming one,\" \"every village having primary schools and cooperatives,\" and \"publicizing finances from top to bottom,\" etc. Mr. \"Ya Fu\" used the example of Xiaoxiguan Village in Fuping, which he inspected, to prove this. Although the more than one hundred farm households in the village suffered heavy losses in the war, they have all risen to the level of middle peasants. Last winter, during the Lunar New Year, the whole village slaughtered a total of fifty to sixty large pigs, an average of one for every two households. Besides paying a small unified tax once a year, there are no other expenses. Men, women, old and young are dressed neatly. After organizing themselves every day, they go to the people's school together to study, and there are also musical instruments for performing operas and singing. In this village, the word \"poverty\" in the Kangxi Dictionary has been deleted.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美评论家敦促美军离华  盛赞中共深得民心  北平名律师赞扬解放区民生生活\n\n1946-08-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美评论家敦促美军离华\n    盛赞中共深得民心\n    北平名律师赞扬解放区民生生活\n    【新华社延安三十日电】旧金山广播：美评论家史温称：中国反动派的抬头，惹起了许多风波，他们甚至暗杀知识界领袖，参加民主组织及主张民主运动的人都遭受过他们的摧残，现在好战派展开更大的内战。史温继称：如果不与共产党及其他政党组成联合政府，就要酿成更大内战。渠主张一旦正式内战，美军须马上离开中国。史温结语称：中共取得了广大人民的赞同，中共一定能胜利。\n    【新华社阜平三十日电】北平名律师亚夫（化名）先生日前来冀晋解放区游历，临离去时，特为冀晋日报撰文畅谈观感称：解放区绝对见不到和已绝迹的是“贪官、劣绅”、“漏网汉奸”、“充塞市场的外来品”、“游手好闲的二流子”、“娼妓、赌徒”、“三十岁以下不识字的人”、“荒芜的田园”、“非刑打骂”、“奸媳、乞丐”、“游僧邪教”、“奇装异服招摇过市者”等十几项，而有的可简括为“政治简便公允，发挥民权”、“官吏军人对人温和体贴”，“凡属日用品均可自造”，“路不失遗，夜不闭户”，“报纸风行，言论自由”，“男耕女织有工作”，“军民一体，官民携手，切实打成一片”，“各乡村皆有小学和合作社”，“上下财政公开”等。“亚夫”先生并以其所考察的阜平小西管村为例，予以证明，该村一百多户农家，虽在战争中遭受惨重损失，却都已上升为中农。去冬旧历年节，全村共宰了五六十口大猪，平均两家一口。负担除一年纳一次少许的统一税外，其余无丝毫花费。男女老幼穿着整洁，每日组织完毕相偕入民校学习，并有演戏歌唱等器乐。在此村，康熙字典中之“穷”字已被删除。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-02",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 30th: Chiang Kai-shek has deployed 71 of his 91 army corps (78% of his total military force) to the front lines of the civil war. The civil war has expanded from the Central Plains to Jiangsu, Anhui, and the entirety of North China. Additionally, Chiang's troops in the Northeast are poised to take action. The Chinese civil war has begun to take on a national scale. In July alone, Chiang's troops successively occupied 14 county towns and over 300 villages in the liberated areas. These 14 county towns are Rugao, Tianchang, Xiaoxian, Lingbi, and Sixian in Jiangsu and Anhui; Wenxi in Shanxi; and Jimo, Jiaoxian, Yidu, Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, Zouping, and Jiyang in Shandong. Who is attacking whom is plainly evident. However, in the one month of offensives, Chiang Kai-shek has paid the price of 53,000 casualties, at least one-fiftieth of his total army strength. It is generally accepted that towns and cities can change hands, but the massive attrition of manpower, the most crucial factor in war, is a loss that is difficult to replenish. The more Chiang Kai-shek expands his offensives against the liberated areas, the more his forces will be stretched thin. Under the strong counter-attacks of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, Chiang's troops will continue to lose more of their manpower, and their morale will inevitably decline. The forces defending Chiang's rear in fifteen provinces have been reduced to twenty corps a month ago, and recently, three more corps have been drawn into the civil war. Insufficient troop strength and low morale will be an insurmountable difficulty for Chiang Kai-shek in the military aspect. The war situation of the past ten days is summarized by region as follows:\n\n\t(1) Jiangsu and Anhui Front: Chiang's troops besieging the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas total 500,000, of which 250,000 have launched offensives from the south, west, and north. The fighting began on the southern front, launched under the command of Tang Enbo, extending over a hundred miles from Laian to Nantong along the Yangtze River and deep into the liberated areas. Chiang's troops suffered a devastating blow from the New Fourth Army in the Rugao and Taixing areas, losing over 20,000 men. He urgently transferred the 65th and 3rd Corps from Hangzhou and other places as reinforcements. Tianchang, Rugao, and Jiangyan town east of Taizhou have been captured, and offensives continue in an attempt to seize Xuyi, Shaobo, Qutang, and Haian. Chiang's troops, deployed along the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, from Xuzhou to Bengbu over a 500-li stretch, are launching offensives east and west of the railway, extending 50 to 100 li in each direction. The main force of the offensive against Huaibei east of the railway, consisting of the 7th, 48th, and 58th Corps, captured Lingbi City on the 22nd and continued their attacks, occupying Sixian City, the seat of the Seventh Administrative Region of Jiangsu and Anhui, on the 28th. Chiang's troops, attacking Huaibei west of the railway, captured Xiaoxian again on the 18th and Suixikou on the 19th, with one target being Yongcheng in the easternmost part of Henan Province. Chiang's troops, advancing southeast from Xuzhou along the coastal highway, after capturing Shuanggou and Chulan on the Ban Gu line, are attempting to invade Suining City. Simultaneously with the land offensive, Chiang's troops have seven U.S.-supplied warships and over 50 aircraft from the Sixth Air Force Group cooperating in the operation. In this offensive operation, Chiang Kai-shek has staked all the troops from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. Kuomintang propaganda organs have clamored about the \"Communist threat to Nanjing and Shanghai\" and even fabricated rumors of attempted riots, but the 74th Corps, which attacked Tianchang, was originally the guard force of Nanjing under Tang Enbo, and the 11th Corps, stationed in Chongming and Kunshan, was originally responsible for the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line's defense but has now been used as a mobile corps to attack central Jiangsu. Even so, Chiang's front-line commanders still feel that this battle is not very promising, especially since the main force of the 49th Corps was annihilated in the Rugao area, which has greatly affected the morale of Chiang's troops.\n\n\t(2) Central Plains Front: After the breakout of the Central Plains Communist troops, one unit personally led by Li Xiannian west of the Pinghan Railway has crossed the Dan River and entered the Shangnan and Shanyang areas of southern Shaanxi. Chiang Kai-shek dispatched six divisions to pursue them for thousands of miles and transferred four divisions of Hu Zongnan's troops to block them in Jingziguan and Mancheng Pass. On the 17th, he telegraphed all armies three times, ordering them to encircle and annihilate Li's unit south of Jingziguan, making the fighting exceptionally fierce. From the 19th to the 21st, Chiang's troops formed five encirclements, but Li Xiannian's unit broke through them one by one, successfully breaking out of the encirclement. Ironically, Chiang Kai-shek offered a reward of three million to capture Li Xiannian, while simultaneously requesting Commander Li to attend a meeting in Longjuzhai to discuss mediation. Another unit led by Wang Shusheng, breaking out to the west, has advanced to the Wudang Mountain area on the border of Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi. Chiang's troops are pursuing with three divisions and transferring Sichuan troops from northeastern Sichuan to block them. In a battle north of Baokang on the 22nd, over 400 enemy soldiers were annihilated. As for the units breaking out to the east, one unit has entered a safe zone, while two other units are engaged in counter-\"encirclement and suppression\" operations with Chiang's troops in the Guangshan and Xuanhuaidian areas of eastern Henan and the Taihu and Qianshan areas of western Anhui. It is reported that Chiang's troops are transferring two divisions of the Fourth Corps under Wu Qisheng from Jiangxi to reinforce the north, and a fierce battle is expected. In this pursuit and blockade of the Central Plains breakout troops, Chiang's troops are in a state of confusion. Not only do middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers feel weary, but a certain high-ranking officer also believes that the failure to \"encircle and annihilate\" the Central Plains troops is a major failure. However, Chiang Kai-shek is still punishing \"ineffective\" subordinates and strictly ordering them to continue the pursuit and blockade.\n\n\t(3) Shanxi Front: In the Fen River Delta of southern Shanxi, since the reinforcement of Hu Zongnan's First and Twenty-seventh Corps, the fighting has intensified again, with fierce battles unfolding simultaneously along the Tongpu Railway. After capturing the Zhang (dian)-Mao (jin) Highway, they also captured Wenxi City. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, successively annihilating five regiments of Chiang-Yan troops in the area west of Wenxi. Currently, the Chiang-Yan troops are continuing their offensive, attempting to clear the railway line between Wenxi and Linfen to the north. Qinxian City, the midpoint of the second railway in southern Shanxi, the Baijin Line, is a small knife inserted into the southeastern Shanxi liberated area by Duan Bingchang's puppet troops incorporated by Yan Xishan. Local people, with the support of the Eighth Route Army, disarmed the puppet troops on the evening of the 21st and liberated Qinxian City and several puppet military strongholds to the north. Currently, the entire Baijin Line south of Nanguan is controlled by the Eighth Route Army, and the Qinxian and Wuxiang areas have been liberated. In central Shanxi, after Yan Xishan, in conjunction with Japanese and puppet troops, invaded large areas of plains in Fenyang, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng, they continued their offensive towards the Lüliang Mountains. At the same time, Yan Xishan's troops in Datong also ventured south and east along the Tongpu and PingSui Railways in response. The JinSui and JiJin Eighth Route Armies took defensive actions, successively disarming Yan's and puppet troops in Shuoxian, Ningwu, Shanyin, Fanshi, Daixian, Guoxian, Wutai, Dingxiang, Yuanping, and Xinkou. By this point, there were no traces of puppet troops on the 500-li section of the northern Tongpu Railway, and the Wutai and Lüliang Mountains were connected as one.\n\n\t(4) Shandong Front: The Shandong war is continuing along the Jiaoji Railway. Chiang Kai-shek has concentrated five corps, with Jinan, Weixian, and Qingdao as bases, supporting each other and launching fierce attacks in separate directions. After invading Zouping, Zhangqiu, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Zichuan, Boshan, and Jiaoxian, they reoccupied Yidu on the 23rd and will attack Gaomi City and other stations still defended by the New Fourth Army, in an attempt to clear the entire Jiaoji line. At the same time, a fierce battle is also unfolding for Jiyang City northeast of Jinan.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-02",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Strange Drama in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East\n　　Liberation Daily Editorial, 30th\n　　Yesterday's newspaper reported on the trial of Doihara in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Doihara was an expert in the Japanese invasion of China, serving as the head of Japanese intelligence agencies in the Northeast and North China. He was one of the main instigators of the September 18th Incident, the North China Incident, and the Lugouqiao Incident. When mentioning this heinous war criminal, the Chinese people gnash their teeth in hatred. Logically, our representative in the tribunal for judging Japanese warlords should righteously accuse the Japanese of their atrocities, enumerate the war crimes, seek justice for our millions of victims, and urge the court to impose severe sentences as a clear warning. However, the representative of the Kuomintang government, Vice Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun, who testified in court, not only failed to present a powerful accusation but was intimidated by Doihara's arrogance, turning the war criminal trial into a strange drama of a witness being cowed by the accused. China is a victorious nation, Japan is a defeated nation, yet the representative of the victorious nation showed timidity and incompetence before a war criminal of the defeated nation who was already bound and awaiting sentencing. This is truly a shameful phenomenon unprecedented in history!\n　　However, the strange drama in the Tokyo Tribunal is not accidental. The appearance of this strange drama reflects, on the one hand, the attitude of the American authorities today, which is not to severely punish Japanese fascist war criminals but to adopt an attitude of appeasement and indulgence; on the other hand, it also illustrates how corrupt and incompetent the Kuomintang government is. Among the bureaucratic warlords of the Kuomintang government, Qin Dechun is not the most typical figure. Qin Dechun's disgrace in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is a minor case compared to the power-grabbing, humiliating, corrupt, incompetent, and people-harming behavior of the main leaders of the Kuomintang government. It is well known that before the \"July 7th\" Incident, the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a policy of non-resistance, abandoning the Northeast, signing the Shanghai, Tanggu, and He-Ume agreements, and conspiring with figures like Doihara to suppress the Chinese people's anti-Japanese national salvation movement. During the War of Resistance, the reactionaries were passive in resisting Japan on the one hand, and maintained constant contact with Japanese emissaries on the other, and implemented the so-called \"curved-line national salvation theory,\" dispatching a large number of generals to surrender to the Japanese, colluding with the enemy to carry out the conspiracy to eliminate the Liberated Areas. After the victory of the War of Resistance, in his speech on August 15th, Chiang Kai-shek declared: \"We must be able to love the enemy\" and \"not dwell on old grievances.\" Under this absurd policy, Chiang Kai-shek used Japanese troops, incorporated puppet troops, and alongside the American-equipped Kuomintang army, attacked the Liberated Areas, slaughtering their own compatriots. Even today, the top war criminal Okamura Neiji still resides in Nanjing, unpunished. Based solely on these facts, it is not difficult to understand why Japanese warlords do not take the representatives of the Kuomintang government seriously at all. In the past, the Chiang Kai-shek government had bowed down to the Japanese warlords countless times, and the Japanese warlords had manipulated the Chiang Kai-shek government at will. Today, the Chinese fascist reactionaries still maintain contact with the remnants of Japanese fascism, colluding with each other. Precisely because of this, when several ordinary Chinese citizens testified about the atrocities of the Japanese army in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, war criminals such as Tojo and Doihara \"looked down and remained silent,\" but when the official representative of the Chinese government, the Kuomintang government, came out to testify, the war criminals became animated, and the chief war criminal Tojo even \"laughed heartily.\"\n　　The strange drama in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East symbolizes the Kuomintang government's loss of sovereignty and humiliation, and its corruption. On the international stage, it not only cannot represent the will of the Chinese people, but is constantly losing the dignity of our country. If this situation continues, the glorious status of being one of the four great powers, which the Chinese people won through blood and sacrifice, is in danger of being completely lost.\n　　The Chinese people suffered the most from the Japanese invasion and sacrificed the most in the anti-Japanese war. The democratization of Japan after the war is closely related to China's independence, peace, and democratic cause. Therefore, the Chinese people are extremely concerned about the Allied powers' control of Japan. The Chinese people cannot allow the American authorities to continue their policy of condoning war criminals, and especially cannot allow the Kuomintang government authorities to be indifferent to this policy, so that Japanese fascist war criminals still dare to show contempt for the Chinese nation today. As one of the major countries that defeated Japan, China has the right and the obligation to actively participate in the work of controlling Japan. The current Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government has repeatedly proven its incompetence in fulfilling this historical task. In order to guarantee China's prestige in the international community, the Chinese people can no longer allow the Chiang Kai-shek government to send representatives to international conferences alone. In order to enable the true representatives of the Chinese people to actively participate in the work of controlling Japan, and to ensure the thorough elimination of Japanese war criminals and militarism and the democratization of the Japanese state, so as to guarantee lasting peace in the Far East, we believe that the Allied Council for Japan, the Far Eastern Commission, and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East should not only have representatives of the Kuomintang government participating, but should also allow the Chinese people, especially the representatives of the Liberated Areas who fought most heroically and contributed the most to the anti-Japanese war, to participate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 远东国际法庭上的怪剧  解放日报三十日社论\n\n1946-08-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　远东国际法庭上的怪剧\n    解放日报三十日社论\n    昨天报上登载远东国际法庭审判土肥原的消息，土肥原是日寇侵华阴谋专家，历任日寇在东北和华北的特务机关长，为九一八事变、华北事变、芦沟桥事变的主要策动者之一，一提起这一罪恶滔天的战犯，我们中国人民莫不切齿痕恨。照理，我国代表在审判日本军阀的法庭上，自应理直气壮控告日寇暴行，列数战犯罪恶，为我千百万被难同胞伸冤，督促法庭严加判决，明证典刑。可是出庭作证的国民党政府代表国防部次长秦德纯，既不能提出有力的控诉，反而慑于土肥原狂妄的气焰，演成战犯审判证人的怪剧。中国是战胜国，日本是战败国，战胜国的代表竟然在已经束手就缚等待判罪的战败国战犯的前面表现畏缩无能，这真是古今中外未有的可耻现象！\n    但是，东京法庭上的怪剧，并不是偶然的。这一怪剧的出现，一方面反映美国当局今天对日本法西斯战犯不是给以严厉的惩罚，而是采取姑息和纵容的态度；另一方面，又说明国民党政府当局是如何腐朽无能。在国民党政府的官僚军阀中间，秦德纯并不是最典型的人物，秦德纯在远东国际法庭出丑，较诸国民党政府的主要负责人丧权辱国，腐朽无能，残害人民的行为，可以说是小巫见大巫。尽人皆知，“七七”以前，国民党反动派实行不抵抗主义，抛送东北，签订上海、塘沽、何梅等协定，并与土肥原之流，同谋镇压中国人民的抗日救国运动。在抗战中，反动派一方面消极抗战，另方面与日寇密使不断往来，并实行所谓“曲线救国论”，派遣大批将领投降日寇，勾结敌人进行消灭解放区的阴谋。在抗战胜利以后，蒋介石八月十五日演讲中，即宣称：“要能爱敌”，要“不念旧恶”。在这种荒谬方针之下，蒋介石就使用日军，收编伪军，与美械化的国民党军队并肩进攻解放区，屠杀本国同胞。直到今天，头号战犯冈村宁次还是安居南京，没有受到审判。仅仅根据以上这些事实，就不难了解为什么日本军阀对国民党政府的代表根本不放在眼内。在过去，蒋介石政府曾对日本军阀作无数次的屈膝，日本军阀曾把蒋介石政府玩弄于掌股之上。在今天，中国法西斯反动派也还和日本法西斯残余保持联系，狼狈为奸。正因为如此，当几个中国普通公民在远东国际法庭上证明日军暴行时，东条、土肥原等战争罪犯，都“眼睛望下，沉默不语”，而当中国政府国民党政府的正式代表出来作证时，战犯们反而眉飞色舞，战犯首条甚至“哈哈大笑”。\n    远东国际法庭上的怪剧，象征着蒋介石政府的丧权辱国和腐朽，它在国际舞台上，不但不能代表中国人民的意志，反而在天天丧失我们国家的尊严，这种情况如果继续下去，中国人民流血牺牲所争来的四强之一的光荣地位，有被完全丧失的危险。\n    中国人民受日寇侵略的祸害最为深重，在反日战争中牺牲最大，而战后日本的民主化，对于中国的独立、和平与民主事业有密切的关系，因此中国人民对盟国管制日本的工作，是异常关切的，中国人民不能允许美国当局继续纵容战犯的政策，尤其不能允许国民党政府当局对这种政策的漠不关心，以致使得日本法西斯战犯到今天还敢于对中华民族表示轻侮。中国作为战胜日本的主要国家之一，有权利也有义务积极参加管制日本的工作，今天的蒋介石独裁政府对于这一历史任务，已再三证明其不能胜任。为了保证中国在国际上的威信，中国人民再不能允许蒋介石政府独自派遣代表出席国际会议，为了使中国人民的真正代表积极参加管制日本的工作，并保证日本战犯与军国主义的彻底肃清与日本国家的民主化，以保证远东的持久和平，我们认为盟国对日本委员会、远东委员会和远东国际法庭，决不应仅仅有国民党政府的代表参加，而应当允许中国人民，特别是对日抗战最英勇、贡献特大的解放区人民代表参加。"

    "content": "Preliminary Breakthrough in Mass Movement in the Suburbs of Linzhang\n　　Combining Rent Reduction with Anti-Traitor Activities; Middle Peasants Participate in the Struggle, Expanding the Mass Ranks\n　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Linzhang] The second rent reduction movement by farmers in the suburbs of Linzhang County is being carried out in conjunction with the anti-traitor liquidation campaign by the poor in the urban area, and has achieved a preliminary breakthrough. This spring, more than a hundred tenant farmers in villages around the city, such as Luocun, launched a struggle against the big landlord Wang Guide, recovering a season's worth of grain. However, because they did not vent the pain inflicted on them by the local tyrant who relied on enemy power, their thinking was not conscious enough, and some tenant farmers secretly returned the grain to the landlord afterwards, causing the movement to decline. Recently, the masses in the urban area launched an anti-traitor complaint movement. Influenced by this, tenant farmers in Luocun contacted more than a hundred tenant farmers in three villages and petitioned the government, demanding to settle accounts with the local tyrant Wang Guide and the traitor Wang Laobuzi. The leadership combined the anti-traitor campaign with rent reduction, and the masses' fighting spirit suddenly surged. In late last month, more than 6,000 tenant farmers from five villages around the city, united with poor people from nine villages in the urban area, launched a struggle against Wang Laobuzi, the first traitor in Linzhang to surrender to the enemy, and the big landlord Wang Guide. At the meeting, more than 20 people accused the traitor Wang Laobuzi of offering the silver and grain ledgers to the enemy with both hands after the Japanese occupied Linzhang, betraying the people of the entire county, and conspiring with the local tyrant Wang Guide to allocate money and grain specifically meant for the poor. Impartial gentry from the urban area questioned Wang Laobuzi,责备责备 criticizing him for handing over the silver and grain stubs to the enemy.\n　　The masses were even more resentful of the local tyrant Wang Guide. An old lady, holding a medicine pot, complained in public, scolding Wang Guide for seizing eighteen mu of her family's good land through high-interest loans, making her family live in misery, and even now she still needs her medicine pot. The masses complained one after another. Faced with the masses' righteous accusations, the traitor and local tyrant bowed their heads and confessed their guilt. A liquidation committee was formed at the meeting, and according to law, it liquidated 720 mu of land, 18 cotton gins, 42 poplar trees, 110,000 yuan of flower business money, and two courtyards.\n　　[Another Report] After the liberation of Linzhang, there was a rent reduction and grain recovery movement in the urban area. Only about 20 tenant farmer families in the entire city achieved victory. The vast majority of urban poor people were excluded from the tenant farmer movement, and the traitors and local tyrants remained at large, not having been eliminated. In order to break through this narrow circle of the tenant farmer movement, the leadership paid attention to taking care of the interests of the middle peasants in the recent liquidation struggle against the local tyrant Yang Zaitian in the southeast corner of the city. One middle peasant who had served as a 保长 (baozhang) and running dog was willing to repent to the masses. The leadership immediately mobilized the masses to discuss the matter. After he thoroughly confessed, not only was he not punished, but he was also greatly encouraged. Seeing this situation, some middle peasants' morale suddenly soared. When complaining about the local tyrant Yang Zaitian, 16 middle peasant households immediately participated. Out of more than 60 households in the entire street, 40 to 50 households spoke. The ranks of the masses grew, and the local tyrant had no choice but to bow his head to the masses. This time, a total of 1,200 jin of cotton batting and 250,000 yuan were seized from Yang Zaitian's embezzlement. The victory of the struggle in the southeast corner of the city prompted the masses in the four gates and nine villages to rise up and complain, accusing the traitor 保长 (baozhang) of forcing the masses to tear off their cotton batting during the famine years to supply the enemy, forming a mass anti-traitor liquidation movement.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st - Moscow Radio reports: During the first day of the Paris Peace Conference, when discussing the establishment of a committee on rules of procedure for the conference, the Australian representative, Evatt, made an unfavorable statement attempting to overturn the resolution on rules of procedure prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers. Evatt's statement created a bad impression because he was playing rude tricks and was close to the main representatives of the Anglo-American group. (Note: Evatt, appearing as a representative of \"small countries,\" demanded that the seventeen countries \"should have the same rights as the four powers to finally decide on the treaty,\" and argued that this was a matter of principle of \"great importance.\") According to a United Press report: \"Some other small countries' delegations take a not very important attitude towards the Australian representative's efforts. People close to Canadian Prime Minister King say that King is indifferent to Evatt's tactics. The Rules of Procedure Committee adopted at the first meeting consisted of one representative from each of the twenty-one countries. When discussing the committee's work on the 29th, Benes suggested that its first meeting should determine its own working procedures and meeting times. This suggestion was adopted. Benes has decided to send a representative to the first meeting of the Rules of Procedure Committee on the morning of the 30th. It is heard that Benes believes that the principle should be that motions in the peace conference should be passed by a two-thirds vote, but he also stated that he could change his mind at any time if the Rules of Procedure Committee could come up with a better suggestion. Evatt is still trying hard to win the principle of majority vote, rather than a two-thirds vote.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st - Various reports: On the second day of the Paris Peace Conference, the chief representatives of the United States, Britain, and China successively delivered speeches. In his speech, Benes particularly emphasized two points: first, the victors must strictly abide by the principles of guarantees and declarations they gave during the war. For example, when dealing with disputes over territorial claims, they must not forget the wording of the Atlantic Charter or try to limit their application; second, the victors should not impose such clauses that would only give reactionary elements in the defeated countries an opportunity to raise their heads, while depriving democratic forces of any opportunity to exist or consolidate. Benes also elaborated on the views of the US delegation on the military, territorial, political, and economic clauses of the draft treaty submitted to the conference for deliberation, as well as the issue of Italian colonies. British Prime Minister Attlee then spoke, stating: \"Most of the tasks before you have been completed by the four powers. They have reached the greatest degree of agreement. We will voluntarily support them at this meeting.\" After Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's speech, the meeting approved the work of the Credentials Committee, reporting that all delegates' credentials were qualified. The meeting on the 31st will continue to discuss general issues, with speeches by representatives from Evatt, Brazil, and Belarus.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎和会第一天  讨论建立程序委员会  澳代表声明企图推翻外长会议决议\n\n1946-08-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎和会第一天\n    讨论建立程序委员会\n    澳代表声明企图推翻外长会议决议\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】莫斯科广播称：当巴黎和会在第一天讨论关于建立会议程序规则委员会时，澳代表伊瓦特曾发表不好的声明，企图推翻外长会议所准备的会议程序规则决议。伊瓦特的声明发生了不好的印象，因为他在玩弄粗鲁的把戏，而是亲近依赖英美集团的主要代表（按伊瓦特以代表“小国”的面貌，要求十七国“应与四强同样权利以最后决定和约”，并辩称这是一个原则问题，有“极大重要性”。）据合众社报导：“其他一些小国的代表团，对于澳洲代表之努力，持不很重要的态度。接近加总理金氏之人士称：金氏对伊瓦特的策略冷淡。首次大会所通过之程序规则委员会，系由二十一国各派代表一人组成，当二十九日讨论该委员会工作时，贝纳斯建议其首次会议应决定其本身之工作程序及会议时间，此一建议获得通过，贝纳斯已决定于三十日晨派代表出席程序规则委员会的第一次会议。闻贝氏认为和会中议案应以三分之二的票数通过为原则，但是又表示程序规则委员会如能有更好之建议，他随时可以改变意见。伊瓦特则仍在极力争取大多数通过之原则，而非以三分之二通过为原则。\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】各方报导：巴黎和会第二日，美英中首席代表相继发表演说。贝纳斯在演说时，特别强调两点：即第一、胜利者必须严格遵守战时他们给予的保证和声明的原则，譬如在处理领土要求的纠纷时，必须不能忘记大西洋宪章的辞句，或是设法限制他们的应用；第二，胜利者不应强加诸此种条款，即仅仅给予战败国家反动分子以抬头机会，而剥夺民主力量以任何存在或巩固之机会。贝纳斯并就提交大会研讨之和约草案的军事条款、领土、政治及经济条款及意大利殖民地问题，阐述美国代表团的意见。英首相艾德礼继起发言，艾氏声称：“诸位面前的大部任务已由四强完成了，他们已达到了最大程度的协议，我们在这一会议上将自愿地支持他们。”在中国外长王世杰演说之后，会议通过了代表资格审查委员会的工作，报告全体代表证书皆属合格。三十一日的会议，仍将讨论一般问题，将由伊瓦特，巴西与白俄罗斯的代表讲演。"

Findlay Davidson and Others Arrive in Bohai Region to Investigate Disaster Situation\n    [Linyi, 31st dispatch] The Shandong Liberated Area Provincial Assembly, the Provincial Government, and the Shandong Branch of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee, representing 29 million people in the liberated area, sent a letter to the UNRRA China Office and forwarded it to UNRRA, stating: \"We believe that the China Relief Headquarters must be thoroughly reorganized, and representatives of the people from the liberated areas and democratic人士 from all parties should participate in order to achieve fair distribution of materials and effective disaster relief. The proposal made by the CCP representative General Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, the chief person in charge of the relief committee in the liberated areas, that the liberated areas directly send representatives to the UNRRA headquarters in Washington to prevent the Kuomintang's one-party government from engaging in private gain and corruption, is fully supported by us, representing 29 million people in the Shandong Liberated Area. The statement by the Kuomintang government spokesperson that 'the Chinese government's policy of distributing relief supplies is based on need, and the government has absolutely no other considerations' is completely inconsistent with the facts. The vast area north of the Longhai Railway, south of Tianjin, and east of the Jinpu Railway in the Shandong Liberated Area has been devastated by the violent Japanese for eight years. According to incomplete statistics, the losses have reached over 220 million yuan, and more than 30% of the total population is in urgent need of relief. If based on need, this area is the most in need. However, the relief supplies received in the past five months were only 1,300 tons, and the average per person was less than two taels on the market scale. The Kuomintang government and the China Relief Headquarters have repeatedly used transportation difficulties as an excuse. In fact, most areas of the Shandong Liberated Area can use wooden boats, sailing boats, and steamships... (code unclear) The Kuomintang military police stationed in Qingdao surrounded and detained them. In order to facilitate highway transportation, the liberated area mobilized 70,000 people to rush to repair more than 500 li of the Jiao (county) Lin (yi) highway. After the first batch of supplies arrived, more than 10,000 li of highway were repaired one after another. However, due to the Kuomintang authorities withholding gasoline, the highway could not be used, and a large number of relief supplies were transported by car to the areas ruled by the Kuomintang and puppet troops, resulting in the areas ruled by the Kuomintang and puppet troops in Shandong, with a population of less than two million, receiving several times more supplies than the liberated area with a population of 29 million.\" The letter continued: \"The Shandong Liberated Area has always adopted a spirit of cooperation and provided convenience for the transportation of materials. All the meager supplies that have been transported have been completely and directly distributed to those in need, and the relief agencies are very sound. If reasonably allocated relief supplies can be obtained, the relief effect will definitely be brought into play.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 必须彻底改组中国行总机构  山东解放区致函联总  联总顾希伯等抵渤海区调查灾情\n\n1946-08-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　必须彻底改组中国行总机构\n    山东解放区致函联总   \n    联总顾希伯等抵渤海区调查灾情\n    【临沂三十一日电】山东解放区省参议会，省政府及中国解放区救济委员会山东分会等，代表该解放区二千九百万人民致函联总中国分署并转联总称：“我们认为必须彻底改组中国行总机构，应有解放区人民代表及各方民主人士参加，以求得物资的公平分配与有效的救济灾民，中共代表周恩来将军与解放区善后救济委员会总负责人董必武所提，由解放区直接派遣代表参加华盛顿善后救济总署，以免国民党一党政府营私舞弊的主张，我们代表山东解放区二千九百万人民全力拥护。国民党政府发言人所谓“中国政府分配救济物资之政策，系以需要为基础，政府方面绝无其他之考虑”一说，与事实完全不符。山东解放区陇海路以北，天津以南，津浦路以东，这一广大地区，八年来横遭暴日摧残，所受损失据不完全统计，达二万二千万万元以上，急需救济者占总人口的百分之三十以上，如以需要为基础，则此处需要最为迫切。然过去五个月中所获救济物资，仅一千三百吨，每人平均所得尚不及市秤二两，国民党政府及行总方面一再借口交通困难，事实上山东解放区大部地区均可利用木船，帆船及汽船……（电码不明）驻青之国民党军警包围和扣留。解放区为便利公路运输曾以七万人力赶修胶（县）临（沂）公路五百余华里，在首批物资到达后，先后修补公路一万余华里，然而由于国民党当局扣留汽油，以致公路无法利用，而大批救济物资却以汽车运往国民党及伪军统治地区，结果使不满二百万人口之山东国民党与伪军统治区，反较二千九百万人口的解放区，所得物资超过数倍。”该函继称：“山东解放区始终采取合作精神，对物资运输绝予方便，所有运来之微少物资，均完全直接发挥需要者之手，且救济机构均甚健全，如能得到合理分配的救济物资，定可发挥救济效果。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 31st -- After the liberation of Ningwu, the democratic government, accepting the demands of the masses, confiscated all of the more than 10,000 mu of land and 2,500 rooms of housing belonging to the extremely wicked traitors Nan Guixin, Zhao Tingying, and Yang Dayi, and distributed them without compensation to poor peasants for cultivation and residence. Nan Guixin was the economic manager for the Japanese in Shanxi, Zhao was the director of the puppet Shanxi Police Department, and Yang was the former puppet Ningwu County Chief, all of whom were famous traitors in Shanxi. This time, the families of martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, the families of cadres, those who made contributions to the War of Resistance, the masses who suffered the most, and tenant farmers enjoy priority in the distribution, which will enable twenty poor peasant households in Ningwu to turn over from poverty. In the seven villages of Mi Cha Zui, Zhou Jia Bao, Jiang Zhuang Zi, and Shi Ji in Ningwu, more than seventy-eight of the one hundred and seventy households have already received land. During the distribution of the traitorous property, the masses in each village conducted democratic discussions and decided on specific distribution methods. Zhao Maoquan, a tenant farmer in Mi Cha Zui, received 15 *qing* of traitorous land and five houses. The county government immediately issued land certificates and written contracts, making him so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. After Shan Yin Si Fen got five *qing* of good land, he said to everyone he met: \"This time, we have bones with meat on them! As long as we increase production, we will definitely be able to turn ourselves over next year!\" The families of martyrs in Shi Ji and other villages, such as Zhou Fushou and twenty-six other households, received more than one hundred *qing* of land. They actively organized labor exchange teams to weed and plow the land, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. They all said: \"Those who have made contributions are rewarded, and those who have done evil are punished. This is how the world is turned around!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥宁武没收汉奸田产  分给贫苦农民耕种\n\n1946-08-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥宁武没收汉奸田产\n    分给贫苦农民耕种\n    【新华社兴县卅一日电】宁武解放后，民主政府即接受群众要求，已将罪大恶极之卖国贼南桂馨、赵庭英、杨达一，土地一万余亩、房院二千五百余间全部没收，并无代价的分配给贫苦农民耕种与居住。按南桂馨为日本在山西之经济经理人，赵为伪山西警察所长，杨为前伪宁武县长，均属山西著名汉奸。此次分配贫困之抗属、干属死难烈士家属，抗战有功及受害最大之群众，以及雇佃贫农享有分配优先权，这将使宁武廿户贫苦农民从贫困中翻身。宁武之麋查咀、周家堡、姜庄子、石级等七个村庄一百七十户余居民中，已有七十八户贫苦佃户得到土地。分配逆产时，各村群众都进行了民主讨论，并决定具体分配办法。麋查咀佃户赵毛铨分得逆产地十五垧，房屋五间，县政府立即发给地证和文约，喜得它合不拢嘴。山银四分得了五垧好地以后，逢人便说：“这一下有了带肉的骨头，只要加油生产，明年就一定能翻身过来！”石级等村抗属，周福寿等二十六户，得地一百余垧，均积极组织变工、锄草、翻地，生产情绪大为提高，都说：“有功的得奖，恶害的得罚，这才把世界变过来啊！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st. Mr. Li Furen, one of the persons in charge of the China Democratic League Northwest Headquarters, recently cabled Mr. Luo Longji of the China Democratic League in Nanjing, recounting his ordeal and escape. The original cable is as follows:\n\nTo Mr. Luo Longji of the China Democratic League in Nanjing, and forwarded to the Standing Committee of the League:\n\n　　On May 1st, I was kidnapped and assassinated by special agents in Xianyang. On July 17th, I escaped danger and arrived in Yan'an. The details are as follows:\n\n　　At about 9 a.m. on May 1st, I was returning from visiting a friend at the Qinfeng Industrial and Commercial Daily. I was walking along the South Courtyard towards my residence at the People's Education Center. On the way, I reached the entrance of the Provincial Library (located at a narrow intersection), where I saw three large sedans parked on the left side (facing south) with their doors open. Suddenly, four special agents rushed out, seized me from both sides, and forced me into a car. Inside the car, there were already four special agents (a driver, a commander of the kidnapping who sat next to the driver, and two others who took over). The two agents who took over pulled out a blood-stained towel from inside the car, blindfolded me, and tightened a leather belt around my throat. Then, they turned me to face the back of the car, pressed my head against the sofa, and held me down in the middle of the seat. The two agents who took over sat on either side. The car then sped away. After forty minutes, the car broke down and stopped. One of the agents said angrily, \"Damn it! Call for another one.\" After several minutes of repair, it continued driving. About half an hour later, it stopped again beside a transportation ditch. Three agents dragged me out of the car, held me up from both sides, and one agent followed with a gun. They dragged me into the transportation ditch. At this time, the agents bound my hands behind my back, contorting my body into a stooped, arched shape. Suddenly, I heard the click of a gun being cocked. The first shot grazed my head, and then the second shot entered my back. I immediately fainted. When I woke up from the coma, I used my left hand to pull off the blindfold and realized that I was on the land of my familiar hometown of Xianyang. The place was a transportation ditch, eight feet deep, extending from Xingping to Dali, built during the War of Resistance. A moment later, a farmer called his son for dinner and discovered someone knocked down in the ditch. He went to the village to call for people, who came and asked me who I was and why I was in this situation. I immediately told them the truth. At this moment, the weather suddenly changed, and a storm began. The farmer reported to my family while helping me out of the ditch and carrying me home. I then learned that the assassination site was Sujiazhuang, located fifteen miles northwest of Xianyang City, near the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway. During the transport, Xianyang County government officials and gentry rushed to express their condolences, some with tears of indignation. After being carried home, farmers came to visit incessantly. The next day, four special agents rode bicycles from Xianyang to search the village. Fortunately, with the protection of the farmers, I escaped their grasp. From then on, special agents searched everywhere. Thanks to the farmers' protection, not a word leaked out. Every time I moved, they secretly guarded me during the day and patrolled with guns at night. Therefore, despite the special agents' best efforts in their repeated \"encirclements,\" they were ultimately unable to find me. However, after more than a month of wandering, it was the farmers who took care of me, treated my wounds, and provided medical care. The medicine and techniques used were rudimentary, and the bullet was never removed. The Kuomintang special agents still refused to let go and intensified their search. The people, fearing that I would fall into the hands of the enemy again, insisted on sending me to the safe Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for refuge. With my consent, they took a roundabout route through seven counties before finally arriving. Initially, because the bullet was lodged in my head, I was in constant pain. Fortunately, the local hospital of the Chinese Communist Party performed an operation to remove the bullet. After a short period of recovery, my health has been restored to a preliminary state. Knowing your concern, I am reporting this via cable. I am deeply grateful for your serious protest to the government authorities regarding my assassination. I can now list four points to prove who the perpetrators were: (1) Before my assassination on May 1st, the special agent terror had already permeated Xi'an. On March 1st, the Qinfeng Industrial and Commercial Daily was burned down by special agents, who then beat the newspaper vendors, tore up newspapers, and set fire to the newspaper office a total of three times. The famous lawyer Mr. Wang Ren, who righteously served as the legal advisor to the newspaper, was arrested by the Xi'an authorities on April 23rd on the charge of being a smoker and was illegally executed. Six days before my assassination, the Kuomintang Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters' Investigation and Statistics Office sent someone to warn the publisher of the \"People's Guide,\" proving that my assassination was part of a series of planned and purposeful acts of violence by the authorities across the country to suppress and assassinate news professionals after the Political Consultative Conference (such as the tragic death of Mr. Yang Zao in a Hangzhou prison and the secret murder of Mr. Sun Pingtian in Nantong). (2) May 1st was the second day of Chairman Chiang's visit to Xi'an. The city was decorated with national flags, and the military police were everywhere. Under such heavily guarded conditions, who would dare to openly kill and set fire except the Kuomintang special agents themselves? I was forced into a car at the entrance of the Provincial Library, and the car openly displayed the words \"Vehicle of the Xi'an Municipal Government.\" Who else would be so reckless? (3) After I was shot but not killed and rescued by the local farmers, four special agents rushed from Xianyang the next morning, carrying business cards from the \"Central Military Academy Special Agent Training Class,\" and searched the village everywhere. Local farmers can testify to this. (4) On May 1st, at Sujiazhuang, fifteen miles northwest of Xianyang City, special agents shot me. The bullet entered the right side of the fifth thoracic vertebra in my back, passed through my chest, and lodged between the right-side carotid artery and jugular vein. The vertebra was damaged, and there is a .38 caliber revolver bullet as evidence. The above four points of evidence conclusively prove that the Xi'an Kuomintang authorities were responsible, leaving no room for denial. I hope the League will protest vigorously based on these facts, send personnel to cooperate with all parties to continue investigating the truth, and have the authorities cooperate with legal experts from various parties to participate in the trial of the main culprits and instigators of the massacre to uphold justice. I also hope that you will vehemently appeal to the authorities and call on democratic people across the country to rise up and stop special agent terror! With respect, and wishing you well! Li Furen, July 29th.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李敷仁致电罗隆基陈述被难脱险经过\n\n1946-08-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李敷仁致电罗隆基陈述被难脱险经过\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】民盟西北总支部负责之一的李敷仁先生，顷致电南京中国民主同盟罗隆基先生，陈述被难脱险经过，原电如下：\n    南京中国民主同盟罗隆基先生，并转本盟中常会钧鉴：\n    我于五月一日被特务绑架暗杀于咸阳，七月十七日脱险抵延，其经过详情如下：\n    五月一日上午九时许，我从秦风工商日报馆访友归来，路经南院，徒步行到民众教育馆寓所，途中走至省立图书馆门首（地处狭路口），即见三辆大卧车停驻在那里左侧（向南），车门敞开，突遇特务四名，蜂踊袭来，将我左右架起，投入汽车，车内早有特务四名（一司机、一指挥绑架者，并座于司机旁，另两名接手），由两名特务接手从车箱内抽出一块染满血迹的毛巾，将我两眼蒙住，并用一条皮带绑紧勒到咽喉，然后将我背向车头，头抵沙发，按纳于车箱座垫中间，接手的两名特务分座两侧，汽车即疾驶而去，四十分钟后，汽车发生故障，停驶下来，一特务气愤的说：“妈的！打电话另叫一部来。”经过数分钟的修理，又继续驶行，约半点钟，复停驻于一交通沟旁，三个特务将我拖出汽车，左右架起，一名持枪随后，拖至交通沟内。此时特务将我绑架，两手抄于背后，体成伛偻弓形，忽闻枪机扳动，第一枪从头际擦过，接着第二枪从背脊射入，当即昏倒，等到从昏迷中苏醒，我用左手揭开蒙眼的毛巾一看，方知我在地形如此熟悉的家乡咸阳的土地上。该处系一交通沟，纵深八尺，自兴平迄大荔，为抗战中所筑。片刻，一农民唤其子吃饭，发现濠沟内有一人被击倒，即到村内呼人，来此问我系何人，因何事如此，我当即以实相告。此时突然天变，风雨大作，农民一边向我家里报信，一边将我扶上沟濠，抬送家中，我始知被暗杀地为苏家庄，位于咸阳城西北十五里处，当西兰公路近旁。在抬送途中，咸阳县府职员及士绅纷纷奔来慰问，有感愤落泪者。既抬送家中，农民纷纷探视，一夜人群来往无间断。翌日从咸阳骑脚踏车赶来四名特务，至村中搜捕，幸赖农民掩护，躲过虎口。从此特务到处搜捕，赖农民保护，不让走露一丝风声，每移一地，他们就为我白天暗中放哨，夜晚持枪守卫，因此使特务们费尽心机，层层“围剿”，终于不能发现。但流亡月余，护痛养伤看护医治者为农民，敷药施术者系土法，弹终未取出；而国民党特务依然毫不松手，且搜捕日严，老百姓怕我再落虎口，定要送入到安全的陕甘宁边区来避难，经我同意，始绕经七县，辗转抵达。初因弹藏头部，时时作痛，幸蒙中共地方医院施行手术，将弹取出，经过短期疗养，健康已算初步恢复。知关锦注，特电奉告！诸公为我被杀事，向政府当局提严重抗议，深为感荷！今敷仁可列举证明四点，以证明行凶者究系何人：（一）在五月一日敷仁被暗杀之前，特务恐怖早已弥漫西安，三月一日秦风工商日报被特务焚毁，旋殴打该报报贩，撕毁报纸，并纵火焚烧该报社先后达三次。名律师王任先生，仗义担任该报法律顾问，竟于四月二十三日被西安当局以烟犯为名捕去，非法枪决。在我被暗杀前六日，国民党陕西省党部调统室曾派人当面警告过“民众导报”发行人，这证明我之被杀，是政协会后当局在全国压制与暗杀新闻从业员（羊枣先生之惨死于杭州狱中，孙平天先生之被暗害于南通等）之一连串有计划和有目的的行凶。（二）五月一日适值蒋主席莅临西安之第二天，全市遍悬国旗，军警林立，在此戒备森严的情况下，试问除了国民党特务自己外，谁敢公开杀人放火？我到省立图书馆门首被架上汽车，该车内公开贴有“西安市政府用车”字样，试问这又是谁在横行无忌呢？（三）我被枪杀未死，得当地农民救护后，翌晨早饭时即有四名特务从咸阳赶来，手持“中央军校特务训练班”名片，在村内到处搜捕，有当地农民为证。（四）五月一日，在咸阳城西北十五里处苏家庄，特务将我枪杀，弹从背部脊椎第五胸椎右侧射入，通胸部后留于颈部右侧动静脉之间，现该脊椎被击损折，并有二号左轮手枪枪弹为证。以上四点证据确凿为西安国民党当局所为，无可抵赖，望本盟据理抗议，派员协同各方续查真象，由当局协同各党派法律专家参加惨案正凶及主使者之审判，以彰公论。并望痛陈当局，呼吁全国民主人士，奋起制止特务恐怖为荷！肃此，并颂时祺！李敷仁，七月二十九日。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-03",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th. Shanghai People's Representative, Director of Shangyuan Enterprise Company, and Chairman of Kaimeike Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhang Gangbo, recently published an article in a Shanghai newspaper entitled \"National Wealth Concentrated in the Hands of a Few People,\" pointing out that bureaucratic warlords concentrated wealth in three steps after the \"July 7th\" Incident: \"After the July 7th Incident, Chinese bureaucratic warlords used their power to dominate transportation agencies, monopolize commerce, and manipulate the market. They used the name of unified control to fill their own pockets with the people's manpower and material resources. This was the first step in transforming national wealth into private property.\" \"The second step was that the Japanese invaders in the occupied areas robbed all materials from the people at the lowest prices and by coercive means, concentrating them in several large cities. In Shanghai alone, there were thousands of warehouses, each piled high like a mountain.\" Zhang also pointed out that the third part of the concentration was after the victory. He said: \"Last September, when the Japanese invaders surrendered, the receiving personnel who came from all over the place saw warehouses full of materials in Shanghai, as well as high-rise buildings, factories, commercial banks, and automobiles and furniture transferred by the enemy and puppets. Everyone's eyes turned red, like hungry tigers pouncing on sheep. They robbed and stole openly and secretly, regardless of reputation or law, taking the initiative as the best strategy. This muddled account has been going on for almost a year, and the government has never made a public announcement. The large amount of wealth concentrated by the Japanese invaders was easily obtained by bureaucratic warlords. The people watched with cold eyes and called it 'plunderous seizure.'\"\n\nZhang continued: \"Bureaucratic capital has already formed its development route. First, it takes over private public opinion organs, cultural organs, stock exchanges, etc., which have a deep foundation in commerce, under the beautiful name of 'increasing shares,' but in reality, it is 'usurping the nest of the magpie.' Then, it classifies the enemy and puppet companies, commercial factories, and financial institutions with substantial content as 'state-owned,' and sells the dilapidated ones to merchants and civilians, luring people to take the bait. The war efforts of the factories in the rear were written off with one stroke and were not given relief. Even in order to find a way out, they did not hesitate to collude with imperialist financial capital, such as opening up inland river navigation rights and revising the Company Law, regardless of losing national sovereignty. As a result, cheap and high-quality American goods came like a landslide. This is how bureaucratic capital transforms into comprador capital, acting as the vanguard of imperialist economic aggression.\"\n\nZhang stated: \"In short, national wealth has been concentrated in a few large cities, and the wealth in the cities is undoubtedly concentrated in the hands of a few bureaucratic warlords. Corruption, embezzlement, and malfeasance have reached the point of decay and collapse in every corner of the administrative and military institutions, just like the blood in the human body is drying up and concentrated in the head, turning into cerebral congestion. Is it dangerous or not?\" Finally, Zhang believed: \"The situation of wealth distribution in China can be said to be unparalleled in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The issue of redistribution is imminent.\" Regarding the distribution of wealth, he proposed three paths: \"First, those who made a fortune from national disasters and the victory should quickly realize their mistakes and voluntarily take out 80% of their ill-gotten gains to relieve the refugees. This is the best policy, but it is also wishful thinking. Second, the government should promptly promulgate a heavy wealth tax policy to impose legal sanctions on them and force them to spit out all their illegal gains. This is a moderate policy, but with political power in their hands, it is like asking a tiger for its skin and will not become a reality. Therefore, it is inevitable to take the last path, which is when the people can no longer endure it, they will rise up in revolt and shed blood in revolution.

More than 200 cadres in Licheng District started on the 12th and spent three days, combining it with current work and ideological inspections, to launch discussions and discover complacency. There was a general lack of understanding of the collusion between Chinese reactionaries and American imperialist elements, and the long-term twists and turns of the Chinese revolution. For example, Wang Zhide, director of the Fifth District Military Committee, said: \"After Japan surrendered, I always thought in my mind that there would be peace, and armament was no longer important. After reflection, everyone recognized the reactionaries' conspiracy and also recognized that the Chinese people, especially the people in the liberated areas, who have undergone eight years of resistance, have the strength to crush the reactionaries' offensive. [We are] determined to do a better job in production and mass work, strengthen the people's strength, strengthen current affairs education, prepare for self-defense, and strive for peace.\" He Si, a farmer cadre at an enlarged cadre meeting in Changzhi County, said: \"Chiang Kai-shek colludes with bad Americans to bully our old folks. I must do my job well and mobilize the folks to not be bullied by them.\" Finally, it was decided that in July all cadres would study and publicize the \"July 7th\" declaration, launch current affairs education, and mobilize the county's masses to defend their hometown and defend the fruits of victory. Cadres of the Third Special District also launched current affairs studies from the 4th to the 10th of this month, and conducted group discussions on the \"July 7th\" declaration, boldly exposing and solving individual thoughts based on the current situation, and recognizing current work tasks.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 清醒头脑加强自卫准备  太行展开时事学习\n\n1946-08-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　清醒头脑加强自卫准备\n    太行展开时事学习\n    【长治三十日电】为研究时事清醒头脑加强自卫准备，太行全区部队机关地方干部，均展开了时事学习，研究中共“七七”宣言。黎城区干部二百余人十二日开始用了三天时间，结合当前的工作和思想检查，展开讨论发现麻痹思想，普遍存在对中国反动派和美帝国主义分子的勾结和中国革命的长期曲折认识不够，如五区武委会主任王志德说：“日本投降后，我思想中总认为和平了，武装不重要了。经过反省，大家认识了反动派阴谋，也认识了经过八年抗战的中国人民，特别是解放区人民是有力量粉碎反动派的进攻，决心更好的作好生产与群众工作，壮大人民力量，加强时事教育，准备自卫，争取和平。长治县扩大干部会议上农民干部何四则说：“蒋介石勾搭美国的坏人来欺负咱老百姓，我一定好好把工作干好，把老百姓动员起来不受他们的欺负。”最后决定七月份全体干部学习与宣传“七七”宣言，展开时事教育，把全县群众动员起来，保卫家乡，保卫胜利果实。三专署干部亦于本月四日到十日，展开了时事学习，分组讨论“七七”宣言，根据目前的时局大胆暴露与解决个人思想，认识当前的工作任务。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 31st: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on an editorial in the New York Times on the 24th, titled \"Our Task in China,\" stating: The author of the article not only openly defends the current US authorities' policy of assisting Chiang in the civil war, but also reveals the author's prejudice and confused ideas. The Xinhua News Agency reporter pointed out: (1) The editorial writer of the New York Times attempts to obliterate the fact that the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government launched the civil war by saying that \"war is inevitable.\" However, the facts cannot be obliterated. On the same day that the New York Times published the editorial, the New York Herald Tribune also published an editorial saying: \"We can hardly ignore or deny the fact that the reactionaries in China, as stated by Ms. Soong (referring to Ms. Soong Ching-ling), are attempting to launch a civil war.\" In recent days, Congressmen DeLacy and many American democrats have been clamoring for an end to aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. It can be seen that the attempt of the New York Times editorial writer is futile. In fact, anyone with a little common sense can see the absurdity of that editorial. According to its statement, both Japan and the United States were \"two sides of the war\" in the Pacific War, and there was no such thing as a culprit at all, and the US war against Japan became superfluous. (2) The New York Times editorial says: \"Chiang Kai-shek's National Government is the only recognized Chinese government and has been guaranteed American assistance as a wartime ally.\" We only need to ask the editorial writer, is the Nationalist government recognized by the United States the only one? Besides the United States, which other country is aiding Chiang in the civil war and interfering in China's internal affairs? The US government recognizes more than just the Chiang Kai-shek government in various countries. May I ask which other government of another country has been given the same \"assistance\" as the Chiang government by the US government? The editorial writer of the New York Times only knows that the National Government of China is recognized by various countries, but he does not know (or perhaps he is \"forgetful\") that the Moscow Conference Declaration of the Foreign Ministers of the Three Powers signed by the US Secretary of State stipulates that this government needs to be reorganized, and President Truman's statement also admitted that this government is a one-party government and that it needs to be reorganized. Obviously, the US authorities' \"assistance\" to Chiang is illegal, and the \"only recognized Chinese government\" cannot change this truth in the slightest. (3) The New York Times editorial's statement that \"any protest should not be directed at the government and its supporters, but should severely condemn those who oppose the government\" is even more outrageous and completely inconsistent with the democratic traditions of the American people. According to this formula, protests should not be \"directed at\" the dictatorial government of murderers, but should be \"directed at\" democratic figures such as Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu who were shot by this government.\n    The Xinhua News Agency reporter finally stated: It is worthy of deep attention from American democrats that the New York Times, which often reflects the opinions of the US authorities, has published such absurd remarks.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美纽约时报言论荒谬新华社记者予以驳斥\n\n1946-08-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美纽约时报言论荒谬新华社记者予以驳斥\n    【新华社延安三十一日电】新华社记者评纽约时报二十四日社论“吾人在中国之任务”一文称：该文作者不仅公开为目前美国当局的援蒋内战政策辩护，而且流露了作者的偏见和糊涂观念。新华社记者指出：（１）纽约时报的社论作者企图以“战争非有的方面不可”的说法，来抹煞蒋介石独裁政府发动内战的事实。但是事实是抹煞不了的，在纽约时报发表社论的同一天，纽约先驱论坛报也发表了一篇社论说：“我们也难忽视或否认宋氏（按指宋庆龄女士）所称中国反动派企图发动内战的事实。”最近几天，德拉西等议员及许多美国民主人士都在大声疾呼，要求停止援助蒋介石内战。可见纽约时报社论作者的企图是徒劳无功的，其实稍有常识的人都可看出那篇社论的荒谬可笑。按照它的说法，太平洋战争中日本与美国都是“战争的两方面”，根本无所谓祸首，而美国的对日作战也成为多余的了。（２）纽约时报社论说：“蒋介石之国民政府为唯一被承认之中国政府，而以战时盟国资格获得美国协助之保证。”我们只要问一问社论作者，承认国民党的政府不只美国政府，除了美国以外，还有那一个国家援蒋内战干涉中国内政呢？美国所承认的各国政府也不只一个蒋介石政府，试问美国政府对于那一个其他国家的政府也给了像给蒋政府那样的“协助”呢？纽约时报的社论作者，只知道中国的国民党政府被各国所承认，但他不知道（也许是“健忘”）美国务卿所签字的三国外长莫斯科会议宣言规定了这个政府有改组之必要，杜鲁门总统的声明也曾承认这一政府是一党政府的事实与其改组之必要。显而易见的，美国当局对蒋的“协助”是不合法的，“唯一被承认之中国政府”并不能丝毫改变这一真理。（３）纽约时报社论所说“任何抗议不应指向该政府及其拥护者，而应痛斥反对该政府者”，更是太不像话，完全不合美国人民的民主传统。按照这种公式，抗议不应“指向”杀人犯的独裁政府，而应“指向”被这种政府枪杀的闻一多、李公朴等民主人士了。\n    新华社记者最后称：常常反映美国当局的意见的纽约时报，竟然发表这样荒谬的言论，值得美国民主人士的深切注意。"

In the forced self-defense, the Eighth Route Army discovered more than 30 American soldiers, cooperating with more than 80 Chiang troops in the battle. As a result of the fighting, both sides suffered casualties. In the afternoon, a part of the U.S. military rushed from Tianjin to reinforce. In order to promote the U.S. military's awareness, the Eighth Route Army immediately withdrew from the battle. This is the truth of the so-called \"Communist army attacking the U.S. military\" by the Central News Agency. According to Brigadier General Whorton, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, the U.S. military that clashed with the Eighth Route Army was a \"patrol team\" from Tianjin to Ping. Mr. Wa did not explain why the U.S. military sent a \"patrol team\" to \"patrol\" to the Liberated Areas, and fought alongside Chiang's troops to attack the Eighth Route Army. In the past two months, the U.S. military has continued to provoke and disturb the Jidong Liberated Area, and now openly cooperates with Chiang's troops to directly fight against the people's army, so that American soldiers who could have returned home to live and work in peace after the end of the war against Japan are making unnecessary sacrifices in China. The Jidong Military Region Headquarters has asked the Beiping Executive Headquarters to investigate the Anping conflict and lodged a strong protest with the U.S. for its illegal act of armed interference in China's internal affairs.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: TASS, Washington, 30th: Several progressive US representatives have demanded the withdrawal of US troops stationed in China and the cessation of aid to the Kuomintang. Democratic Representative DeLacy of Washington State, speaking in the House of Representatives, declared: \"The United States must withdraw its troops, materials, and ships from China to stop the spread of the civil war and prevent other powers from being drawn into the vortex.\" DeLacy stated that the main result of General Marshall's efforts was merely to buy time for the Chiang Kai-shek group to concentrate materials and transport its troops by American ships to the front lines for further combat. According to DeLacy, since the victory over the Japanese invaders, the US government has provided Chiang Kai-shek's army with $600.2 million in lend-lease materials, compared to only $600.31 million before that. DeLacy stated that the policy of unilaterally aiding one side must stop, allowing the various Chinese political parties to find their natural level of political strength. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek will be forced to honestly negotiate with his political enemies, and he will be forced to yield to the Chinese people's universal demands for freedom and economic fairness. DeLacy stated that in this way, there could be hope for a representative government – a government friendly to both the US and the Soviet Union. DeLacy cited an unpublished document prepared by the US State Department's Interim Research and Intelligence Service, considering it to be an \"objective assessment of the main differences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.\" The document stated that the CCP's program – rent reduction, progressive taxation, etc. – aims to meet the needs of the peasants and involve them in solving their own problems. DeLacy pointed out that not only does the CCP oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial politics, but he said that on one side are \"educators, intellectuals, people in business, industry and commerce, and liberal figures among landlords, peasants, and Communists demanding freedom, land reform, a coalition government, hoping for a basic constitution through a government of law,\" and on the other side is \"a powerful, oppressive group of landlords, corrupt officials, relying on terror, military force, and cunning reactionary diplomacy to maintain their position.\"\n    Democratic Representative Patterson of California (a New Deal supporter), in a statement entered into the Congressional Record, declared: \"Marshall can only complete his mission and satisfy the interests of both China and the United States by announcing his failure and packing up and returning home.\" Patterson stated that the time has come to notify the Chinese government that unless it fundamentally changes its own nature, it should not expect to receive further US aid. Recalling Marshall, withdrawing US troops, and ceasing military and economic aid to the central government should be included in this notification. In reviewing Truman's statement on China policy when Marshall went abroad and subsequent developments, Patterson stated that the Chiang Kai-shek government used Marshall's ceasefire agreement to reconfigure and expand its army in order to launch new offensives against the CCP and other democratic forces in Nanjing, while some people in the United States used these ceasefire periods to increase and improve the quantity and quality of US aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government. Patterson stated that the Nanjing army, once it had taken advantage of the ceasefire period, immediately turned to a more violent and brutal civil war.\n    Democratic Representative Savage of Washington State (a New Deal supporter) also had a statement entered into the Congressional Record, in which he pointed out that the ceasefire agreement had already been broken when Marshall requested more funds to be loaned to the Chiang Kai-shek government on March 20th. Savage stated that the purpose of the US extending the lend-lease act to China and giving the Chinese government credit loans was not to encourage the people of China and the United States and the people of all countries to \"believe in the wisdom of the United States or the integrity of its diplomacy.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美进步众议员数人要求撤退驻华美军主停止援助国民党\n\n1946-08-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美进步众议员数人要求撤退驻华美军主停止援助国民党\n    【新华社延安卅一日电】塔斯社华盛顿三十日电：美进步众议员数人，要求撤退驻华美军，停止援助国民党。民主党华盛顿州众议员德拉西在众院发言时宣称：“美国必须撤退在华军队、物资、船只，以停止内战的蔓延，并防止其他列强卷入漩涡。”德拉西称：马歇尔将军努力之主要的结果，只是替蒋介石集团赢得了集中物资、由美国舰船将其军队运送至前线，以便进一步作战之时间。据德拉西宣称：自战胜日寇以来，美国政府已给予蒋介石军队六万万零二百万美元租借物资，而在此次以前，亦不过六万万三十一百万美元而已。德拉西称：片面援助单方的政策必须停止，让中国各政党发现其政治力量自然的水平，如此则蒋介石将被迫与其政敌老老实实地商谈，如此则蒋介石才会被迫对中国人民普遍的要求自由、要求经济公允的呼声屈膝让步。德拉西称：这样才能希望有一个代议制的政府——一个对美对苏均友善的政府。德拉西引证美国国务院临时调查情报处所编制之未公布的文件，认为该文件系对“国共两党主要分歧的客观估价”。该文件称：中共政纲——减租、累进税等之目的，在于满足农民的需要，并使他们参与他们自己问题的解决。德拉西指出不仅中共反对蒋介石之独裁政治，他说一方面是“教育家、知识界人士、实业界、工商界和地主当中的自由主义人士、农民及共产党要求自由、土地改革、联合政府，希望通过一个有法治政府的基本宪法”，另一方面则是“有权势的压迫人民的大地主贪污集团，依靠恐怖手段、军事力量及其诡诈的反动外交以维持其地位”。\n    加利福尼亚州民主党众议员柏德逊（新政拥护者）在其录入国会记录的声明中宣称：“马歇尔只有公布其失败并收拾回国，才能完成其使命，并满足中美两国之利益。”柏氏称：通知中国政府，除非基本上改变其本身之性质，不用想望再得到美国援助之时机已经来到了。召回马歇尔，撤退美军，停止给中央政府以军事经济援助，应当成为这一通知的内容。柏德逊在检讨马歇尔出国时杜鲁门的对华政策声明以及后来的发展时，声称：蒋介石政府利用马歇尔的停战协定来重新配置并扩充其军队，以便对中共、对南京及其他民主势力作新的进攻，同时美国某些人士则利用这些停战期间增加并改善美国对蒋介石政府援助的数量与质量。柏德逊称：南京的军队一旦在利用了停战期间的好处之后，立即转而进行更猛烈更残酷的内战。\n    民主党华盛顿州众议员沙瓦治（新政拥护者）亦有声明录入国会记录，其中指出当马歇尔于三月二十日要求以更多资金借给蒋介石政府时，停战协定早已破坏。沙氏称：美国对华延长租借法案，给中国政府信用贷款，其目的并不在于鼓励中美两国人民及世界各国人民“相信美国的智慧或外交的完整无缺”。"

This is the third victory after annihilating more than 20,000 Chiang Army soldiers in the Taixing and Rugao areas on the southern front. The Chiang Army's 99th Corps, advancing from Jiagou Station on the Jinpu Railway, 80 miles south of Xuzhou, eastward to the Huaibei Liberated Area, continued to invade Yugou and Chaoyangji (both more than 100 miles east of Jiagou) on the 24th, and continued to attack eastward, attempting to coordinate with the Chiang Army attacking southeast of Xuzhou to jointly attack Juining. The New Fourth Army launched a counterattack on the 26th. After fierce fighting until the afternoon of the 27th, it had completely resolved the 92nd Division of the invading army at Yugou. Except for more than 500 people who made futile sacrifices, more than 3,000 officers and soldiers below the deputy division commander, Shen Shengkai, all laid down their weapons. The 60th Division of the same corps, which invaded Chaoyangji, was also partially annihilated by the New Fourth Army, and the remnants fled back to Shuanggou Town under the cover of Chiang's aircraft. At this point, Yugou and Chaoyangji were restored. In this battle, six mountain guns, two rocket launchers, one anti-tank gun, and other spoils of war were seized and are currently being inventoried. This corps is a direct line unit of Chiang Kai-shek, fully equipped with American weaponry.

    "content": "Preventing Damping Enthusiasm\n    Our newspaper correspondent Comrade Song Zhuqin reported: In Beidongfang Village, Linzhang, the land reform movement of the poor peasants has been repeatedly hindered from developing rapidly due to the leadership's failure to meet the demands of the masses. Instead, they have been too timid, so that the masses have not yet seen any improvement. The specific situation is as follows:\n    In April of this year, the masses in Beidongfang Village (mainly poor peasants), in order to oppose the unfair distribution of corvée labor—always assigned to small households and not to large households—initiated a struggle to reform the corvée labor system, with the slogan \"Corvée labor should be assigned according to land acreage: those with more land should contribute more, and if manpower is insufficient, hire people. Organize a peasant association to resist large households.\" At one point, more than 130 households joined the peasant association, nearly half of the village's total households, forming a broad mass movement. However, the leadership did not meet this demand of the masses, neither actively reforming the current corvée labor system nor leading the masses to calculate the past expenses of corvée labor. The masses' enthusiasm immediately waned, saying, \"Anyway, large households can get away with anything! Poor people couldn't turn over in the past, and they still can't now!\"\n    In May, the district allowed the redemption of land that had been taken away at low prices during the famine years. The poor peasants became excited again, thinking, \"This is to let us turn over!\" At that time, eighty or ninety households signed up to redeem their land. But just as two or three families had redeemed their land, the leadership, without investigation, easily believed the report of a few individuals, thinking that those wanting to redeem land were all middle peasants, and issued an order saying, \"Now is the time for planting cotton and harvesting wheat. Redeeming land will affect production and harm the interests of the middle peasants.\" Some middle peasants had bought the land of poor peasants at low prices in the past, but that was only a part of it; much of the land had been seized by landlords and rich peasants. As a result, this part was not allowed to be redeemed either, thus giving the poor peasants a cold shower once again.\n    In July, the land reform work team came to Beidongfang Village. The masses first raised the issue of redeeming land. More than forty people signed up and were willing to do it, and held meetings to pour out their grievances, forming a land redemption committee, deciding not to redeem from middle peasants, but only from landlords and rich peasants. This was completely correct. However, just as the masses were enthusiastically proceeding, a written order from the district came flying in, saying that \"Land redemption requires a government order. Redeeming land arbitrarily is sabotaging the work and will be arrested!\" And they wanted to arrest people at that time. Although this was dissuaded by the land reform work team, the masses' enthusiasm was greatly affected. The masses said, \"Turning over is like a millstone (large stone); half of it is fear of the sky changing and being shot in the dark, and half of it is fear that the district will just talk and not let us do anything!\" \"Turning over is so difficult!\"\n    (Editor's note: If this report is consistent with the actual situation, the leadership has indeed given no small blow to the enthusiasm of the masses and the land reform movement. Although this may be just an isolated phenomenon, it is also worth noting. It is hoped that the relevant parties will study the lessons learned and quickly reverse this situation.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 防止泼冷水\n\n1946-08-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　防止泼冷水\n    本报通讯员宋祝勤同志报导：临漳北东坊村贫农的翻身运动，曾数次因领导上未能根据群众要求，推动运动迅速展开；却因束手束脚，使群众至今未见抬头。其具体情形是：\n    今年四月，北东坊群众（主要是贫农）为反对历来的派差不公——光派小户，不派大户——，酝酿起改造派差制度的斗争，口号是“按地亩派差：地多的多派，人不够就雇人，组织农会抗大户。”一时涌入农会的达到一百三十多户，几占全村户数之半，形成了广大群众性的运动。但领导上对群众这一要求，没有予以满足，既不积极改革现在的派差制度，也不领导群众算过去的支差账，群众情绪马上消沉了下去，说：“反正是大户吃得开！穷人过去不能翻身，现在还是不能翻身！”\n    五月，区里让赎灾荒年被廉价夺去的土地。贫农又兴奋起来，认为“就是叫咱翻身哩！”当时报名赎地的有八九十户。但刚有两三家赎了地，领导上又未经调查，轻易相信了个别人的报告，以为要赎的都是中农的地，下令说：“现在正种棉花，快收麦子，赎地影响生产，损害中农利益。”中农过去有贱价买了贫农土地的，但只是一部分；许多地都是地主富农掠夺去了。这样一来，这一部分也不准赎了，于是又一次给贫农泼了冷水。\n    七月，翻身队到北东坊工作，群众首先就提出赎地问题，有四十多人报名愿干，并纷纷开会诉苦，组成赎地委员会，决定不向中农赎，只向地主富农赎。这是完全正确的。但是，群众正在热烈进行之际，区上的书面命令又飞来了，说是“赎地要有政令才行。随便赎地就是破坏工作，就得扣起来！”并且当时就要扣人。这事虽经翻身队劝阻了，但群众情绪受了很大影响，群众说：“翻身一盘磨（大石）；一半是怕变天打黑枪，一半是怕区里光说不叫干！”“翻身有多难呀！”\n    （编者按：这一报导，如果与实际情形无出入，领导上，对群众热情与翻身运动确是曾已给了不小的打击。虽说这可能只是个别的现象，但也值得注意，希望有关方面研究其中教训，把这一情形迅速转变过来。）"

On May 28th and June 13th, the U.S. and Chiang held two farces in the city at Pier No. 3 of the Grand Harbor, called \"Ship Donation Ceremonies,\" with the U.S. military transferring fifteen U.S. ships to Chiang's side. The second \"ship donation\" involved a total of eight ships, including two tank landing ships, the Zhongjian and Zhongye, two medium landing ships, the Meile and Meisong, and four infantry landing ships, the Lianzhen, Lianbi, Lianguang, and Lianhua.

This reporter visited Mr. Gu and Mr. Lai. According to them, this trip was to transport UNRRA materials, establish contact between UNRRA and the Bohai region, and investigate agriculture and disaster conditions. The materials they carried included 2,500 tons of white flour, 27 boxes of medicine, 20 barrels of gasoline, 50 iron shovels, and 227 sacks. A portion has already been transported to Yangjiaolu (under the jurisdiction of Shouguang County) for unloading. These materials are specifically for Yellow River conservancy relief. Mr. Gu expressed deep dissatisfaction with the poor organization of UNRRA's distribution of materials. He cited an example: \"I saw twelve starving disaster victims on a highway in Guangxi, while the warehouses there were filled with UNRRA flour that had not been distributed.\" Mr. Gu believes that UNRRA's allocation of materials to the Liberated Areas is extremely unfair. He said, \"In the Communist areas of Shandong, the population accounts for 80 to 85 percent of the province, while the Kuomintang areas account for 15 to 20 percent, but the distribution of materials is in inverse proportion. UNRRA has protested to the Kuomintang authorities several times regarding this unreasonable distribution.\" Mr. Lai continued, saying that the main reason why materials cannot be transported to the Liberated Areas is the military blockade by the Kuomintang authorities. Mr. Gu and Mr. Lai were greatly impressed by the active and diligent production of men and women along the way during their trip to the Liberated Areas, and the harmonious and close relationship between the government and the people.

    "date": "1946-08-03",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Yutai New District Mass Movement Experience\n\n    Since the work shift in Yutai New District in early May, in one month, 90% of the villages in the county's five new districts have launched a vigorous mass movement to oppose traitors, settle accounts, and overturn grain and interest debts. More than 50% of the population in over a hundred villages have been organized into farmers' associations, women's associations, children's corps, and rifle squads. Struggles and reasoning are taking place everywhere, and songs and shouting exercises are heard all around. It is a vibrant, earth-shattering, and newly emerging atmosphere.\n\n    How was the movement launched on such a large scale?\n\n    I. Letting Go\n\n    In the past, the leadership and cadres were not sufficiently open-handed. They encouraged the masses to \"move,\" but when the masses wanted to take action, the cadres immediately instructed them: \"This is good,\" \"That is not good\"... Their thinking was that it was better to move \"slowly\" than to move \"steadily.\" The masses said, \"They (referring to the cadres) want the horse to give birth to a foal, but they are afraid of killing the horse by squeezing it,\" \"How can we ever turn ourselves over?\" The leadership discovered this problem and decided to let go, starting first with the leadership and cadres. The Yaotun District cadre meeting resolved this problem well. The leading comrades told the cadres: \"1. Our only purpose is to get the masses to take action. Don't be afraid of making mistakes. The biggest mistake is when the masses don't take action. 2. Don't mechanically execute the old liberated area's pattern of anti-treason, grievance telling, rent reduction, and debt clearing. Don't try to fit the masses into our mold. Inspire them to do whatever they want.\" He didn't talk too much about policy, but only emphasized: Let go and do it, as long as it doesn't violate the interests of the middle peasants. The cadres grasped the new spirit and were all excited. They propagated and inspired the masses, and the masses changed from suspicion to closeness to us. The cadres were overwhelmed, and problems were discovered one after another. The dull atmosphere was broken.\n\n    II. Vigorously Supporting the Masses\n\n    Only by vigorously supporting the masses and resolutely suppressing evil can the long-oppressed masses dare to act boldly and quickly. Combining with the propaganda offensive, the government arrested the hidden enemy and puppet remnants, let them reflect collectively, removed the heavy pressure on the masses' heads, released those with minor crimes after \"washing their faces,\" and handed over those with serious crimes to the masses for meetings and struggles. This top-down support prepared excellent conditions for the development of the movement.\n\n    III. Joint Struggle - Village-by-Village Brewing, Lighting Fires Everywhere\n\n    When Li Ge District turned to the liquidation movement, many cadres subjectively felt that the masses were not sufficiently awakened and lacked experience in struggle. They insisted on fighting a few small battles first to train themselves, so they did not dare to lead the struggle against the big traitor – Li Huaiyang, the puppet county self-defense regiment leader. However, the suffering that Li had inflicted on the masses was too great. The people were very angry and irritated when they saw the more than 50 tall buildings he had built with their own blood and sweat. They said, \"To catch a thief, first catch the king,\" \"If you take down one big bad guy, the little bad guys will cry without being beaten,\" advocating fighting Li first. The leadership accepted this opinion. After five days of brewing, they organized a struggle meeting of more than 15,000 people against Li. Li was overthrown. At the meeting, the masses truly saw their own strength, and the meeting itself played a role in supporting each other. They all said, \"Li Huaiyang has been struggled against, what else is there to be afraid of?\" After the meeting, the cadres took advantage of the heat and went down to assist the activists, brewing village by village, lighting fires everywhere. Large and small struggles were widely launched. Out of the 130 villages in the district, 129 were involved in the movement.\n\n    Joint struggle requires strong leadership, otherwise it is easy to form factional struggles. Paying attention to handling the fruits of struggle can overcome this possible tendency. The leadership has proposed the spirit of \"big villages giving way to small villages, poor villages dividing more, rich villages dividing less. Small villages dividing more, big villages dividing less.\" After the masses discussed and brewed it, it was quickly distributed and handled. At the same time, in joint actions, it is also necessary to carry out timely education on \"poor people all over the world are one family\" and \"unity is strength.\"\n\n    Fast, hot, and chaotic are the characteristics of the initial launch of the mass movement in the new district. The leadership should have the attitude of not being afraid of chaos, but only of not being able to move; not seeking to move well, but only seeking to move. But when the situation is opened up and the masses move, the leadership should grasp the phenomenon of \"inter-village struggle\" in some villages that are focused on purely seizing the fruits, and promptly emphasize the division of village struggles, mobilize the masses in the village to struggle and reason with the rulers in the village, and strengthen class education and policy education, so that the movement can be deepened and improved.\n\n    IV. \"Drill Through Every Crack\", Move Whenever Possible, Organize in Time, Struggle in Time\n\n    The work base in the new district is relatively poor. In the early stage of the movement, the majority of the masses are often willing to turn themselves over, but they are hesitant and watching the movement, unwilling to take the lead. A few bold and daring poor people are eager to turn themselves over and struggle. At this time, the old liberated area's experience of \"incubating ideas until mature, waiting for the majority to consciously think before acting\" cannot be mechanically applied. This will delay time, which is not in line with the new district's law of the masses' urgent demand to turn themselves over. It will also give the enemy and puppet feudal forces time to organize defenses and sabotage, and the activists will feel suppressed and their morale will drop. The correct leadership should be to move whenever possible, drill through every crack, on the one hand not relaxing the education of the few activists on \"there is strength in numbers,\" so that they can more \"connect\" with other masses, on the other hand letting go and letting the masses take action, using living struggle materials to educate the majority, and constantly expanding mass organizations and raising mass awareness. Dazhuang Village in Luotun District is the home of the big traitor Guo Kunchi, a famous village of \"plucking feathers from passing geese,\" and the ruling power is strong. In the beginning, a few people actively participated and struggled against the puppet Baochang (village head) - landlord Guo Fengming. At that time, all the villagers participated. After the victory, the leadership immediately summarized this struggle and educated everyone. The morale of the masses was extremely high. They were willing to actively participate in future struggles. On the same day, the farmers expanded by more than 30 people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鱼台新区群运经验\n\n1946-08-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鱼台新区群运经验\n    鱼台新区自五月初工作转变后，一个月的时间，全县五个新区中有百分之九十的村庄，开展了轰轰烈烈的反奸清算、倒粮倒息的大规模群众运动。一百多个村庄组织了百分之五十以上的人口到农会、妇会、儿童团和钢枪班中。到处都在斗争说理，遍地是歌声和喊操声。轰轰烈烈，天翻地覆，一片新生的气象。\n    运动是怎样大规模开展起来的呢？\n    一、放手\n    在过去，领导上和干部们曾经是不够放手的。他们鼓动群众“动起来”，但是群众要行动了，干部们又马上向群众嘱咐：“这样才好”、“那样不好”……他们的思想是宁可动得“慢”，也要动的“稳”。群众说：“他们（指干部）又要马生驹，又怕蹙死马”，“咱到底怎样翻身呀？”领导上发现了这个问题，决定要放手，并且首先要从领导上、干部中作起。腰屯区的干部会很好的解决了这个问题。领导同志向干部说：“一、我们的唯一目的是让群众行动起来，不要怕犯错误，只有群众行动不起来才是最大的错误。二、不要机械执行老区反奸诉苦——减租清债的规律，不要以我们的圈子去套群众，群众愿作什么就启发他作什么。”他没有过多的谈政策，只是强调提出：放手去作，只要不违犯中农利益就行了。干部们掌握了新的精神个个兴高彩烈，他们向群众宣传启发，群众也一变怀疑为亲近我们了。干部迎接不暇，问题陆续发现。沉闷的空气打破了。\n    二、大力给群众撑腰\n    只有大力给群众撑腰，坚决镇压邪气，久受压迫的群众才能大胆迅速的行动起来。政府结合着宣传攻势，逮捕了隐匿的敌伪残余分子，让他们集中反省，去掉群众头上的重压，罪轻的“洗脸”后释放，罪重的交给群众开会斗争。这种从上而下的撑腰，给运动的开展准备了优良的条件。\n    三、联合斗争——村村酝酿、到处点火\n    李阁区转向清算运动时，许多干部主观上感觉群众觉悟不够，斗争经验缺乏，坚持先打几个小仗锻炼一下，因此不敢领导斗争大汉奸——伪县自卫团长李怀阳。但是，李逆给群众的痛苦太大了，老百姓看到他以自己的血汗建造的五十多间高大楼房，就非常气愤刺眼，他们说：“擒贼先擒王”、“一整大坏蛋，小坏蛋不打自叫唤”，主张先斗李逆。领导上接受了这个意见，经过五天的酝酿，便组织了个一万五千余人的斗争李逆大会。把李逆斗倒了。群众在会上真正看见了自己的力量，会的本身就起了互相撑腰的作用。都说：“李怀阳都斗争了，还怕啥？”会后干部乘热钻下去，协助积极分子，村村酝酿，到处点火，大的小的斗争普遍开展起来，全区一百三十个村，一百二十九个卷入了运动。\n    联合斗争需要强力的领导，否则容易形成宗派斗争。注意处理斗争果实，可克服这种可能的倾向。领导上曾提出“大村让小村，穷庄多分富庄少分。小庄多分大庄少分”的精神。通过群众酝酿讨论后迅速分配处理。同时在联合行动中还要及时进行“天下穷人是一家”、“团结起来力量大”的教育。\n    快、热、乱是新区群运初发动时的特点。领导上应有的态度是不怕动的乱，只怕动不起来；不求动的好，只求动起来。但当局面打开，群众动起来以后，领导上就应掌握部分村庄眼睛向外，为单纯夺取果实而产生的“隔村斗争”现象，及时强调分村斗争，发动本村群众向本村统治者斗争与说理，并加强阶级教育与政策教育，使运动得到深入和提高。\n    四、“有缝就钻”、能动就动，及时组织，及时斗争\n    新区工作基础较差，运动初期往往是大部群众愿意翻身，但对运动又犹豫观望，不愿先出头行动。少数大胆敢干的贫民则急于要求翻身斗争。这时不能机械运用老区“思想酝酿成熟，等待多数思想自觉后再行动”的经验，这样会拖延时间，不合新区群众迫切要求翻身的规律，也会予敌伪封建势力以组织防御时间和破坏机会，积极分子也会感到压抑，情绪低落下来。正确的领导应该是能动就动，见缝就钻，一方面不放松对少数积极分子“人多力量大”的教育，使其更多的“串连”其他群众，另方面放手让群众行动，用活的斗争材料教育大多数，不断的扩大群众组织，提高群众觉悟。罗屯区大×庄是大汉奸郭昆池的家，有名的“雁过拔毛”的村子，统治势力较强。开头是几个人积极活动，斗争了伪保长——地主郭凤明，当时全村群众都参加了，领导上在胜利后马上总结这个斗争，向大家进行教育，群众情绪极高，他们愿意积极参加今后的斗争，当天农民便扩大了三十多个人。"

    "content": "[Heze, 31st Dispatch] Chiang's army's deployment for a large-scale offensive against the Feng (County) Pei (County) liberated area north of the Longhai Railway has been fully completed as of the 30th. Our frontline reporter reports: This offensive is under the unified command of the Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and is divided into three routes: one directly attacks our Pei County from Xuzhou, one attacks our Feng County from Huangkou west of Xuzhou, and the third attacks Weiji, west of Feng County town, from Dangshan on the Longhai Railway. The advancing troops are deployed with local teams as the vanguard, followed by Chiang's army, attempting to use local teams to contain and exhaust our army, and then Chiang's army takes the opportunity to drive straight in. At the same time, Chiang's army is also collecting puppet troops and puppet organization personnel in Dangshan to organize a \"Refugee Homecoming Corps\" of more than 2,000 people, nominally organized into three groups: armed, stretcher-bearing, and transport. In reality, part of them are used as a source of replenishment for the army, and part of them are armed and infiltrate the liberated area to carry out assassinations and espionage. On the 27th, Wu Dongyi, Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Jiangsu Provincial Security Command, personally inspected the above-mentioned civil war deployment in Dangshan and expressed great satisfaction afterward.\n    [Heze, 30th Dispatch] The Kuomintang army in northern Jiangsu is actively deploying to attack our Feng (County) Pei (County) liberated area in southwestern Shandong. On the morning of the 22nd, Feng Ziguo, Commissioner of the Ninth Special District of the Kuomintang in northern Jiangsu, arrived in Dangshan from Xuzhou and convened a meeting of the heads of the security teams of nearby provinces and counties to conduct civil war mobilization, proposing the slogan of \"Northward Advance\". The next day, more than 100 people from the \"Xuzhou Refugee Homecoming Corps\" organized by the Kuomintang also arrived at Jing'anji in southern Pei (County) from Xu, preparing to serve as the civil war vanguard for Chiang's army, which is about to invade Feng (County) Pei (County). In order to facilitate combat transportation, the Kuomintang army in northern Jiangsu began to build a highway between Xu (Zhou) and Jing (Anji) on the 22nd. All the summer crops, such as sorghum, on both sides of the highway were destroyed, resulting in a vast area of more than fifty miles from north to south and one mile from east to west, with no greenery at all. On the 23rd, the 88th Division of Chiang's army marched along the newly built highway to Jing'anji, Daxuzhuang, Xinweizi, and other places in the Feng (County) Pei (County) civil war battlefield. Wu Pinshan's unit of the First Column of the Pseudo-Jiangsu Advance Army was also transferred from Xinweizi to Chenzhuang, west of Xu. The Fourth Regiment of Geng Panxun's Fifth Sub-district Command of the Kuomintang Northern Jiangsu Suppression is also transferred from Chenzhuang to the Sanzilou area in the southeast of Feng County. The situation in Feng and Pei areas of northern Jiangsu is becoming increasingly tense.\n    [Jiaozuo, 30th Dispatch] According to information obtained by our reporter: In the past few days, Chiang's army has increased its P47 air force units to 14 in Xinxiang and established an air force base in the suburbs of Xinxiang. A large number of aircraft bombs have also been gathered at the Xinxiang arsenal. The air force has been carrying out demonstrations and exercises for days, preparing to cooperate with ground troops to wait for an opportunity to attack our northern Henan liberated area. According to people from Xinxiang: Eight days ago, they witnessed Chiang's army using countless vehicles to rush through the streets to the arsenal. At that time, American personnel from the Xinxiang team happened to pass by the vehicles and immediately followed them to the gunpowder depot to check. They found that a large number of American-made bombs had been stored inside, and vehicles were loading bombs to the airport. Chiang's army's blatant violation of the Executive Headquarters' ceasefire order has been confirmed once again. The American personnel expressed great dissatisfaction, and Chiang's army could no longer quibble. According to other information: Chiang's army has transported a large amount of military supplies to Xinxiang from various places. Military vehicles transporting ammunition are frequent. Now, a large number of civilians are being forcibly conscripted. It is estimated that this is a new symbol of the offensive against our northern Henan liberated area.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鲁西南战机一触即发蒋军图犯丰沛解放区\n\n1946-08-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鲁西南战机一触即发蒋军图犯丰沛解放区\n    【荷泽三十一日电】大举进攻陇海线北丰（县）沛（县）解放区的蒋军部署，已于三十日全部完成。本社前线记者报导称：此次进攻，系由国民党江苏省保安司令部统一指挥，共分三路：一由徐州直攻我沛县，一由徐州以西之黄口攻我丰县，第三路由陇海线上之砀山攻我丰县城西之未集。进犯军兵力配署以地方团队作先头部队，蒋军尾随其后，企图以地方团队牵制疲惫我军，然后蒋军始乘机长驱直入。同时蒋军又于砀山大肆收集伪军伪组织人员，组织两千余人的“难民还乡团”，名义上编为武装、担架、运输等三组，实则一部除作为兵源补充外，一部则武装潜入解放区进行暗杀侦探。二十七日，国民党江苏省保安副司令吴东义亲至砀山检阅上述内战部署，事后并表示十分满意。\n    【荷泽卅日电】苏北国民党军，正积极部署向我鲁西南之丰（县）沛（县）解放区进攻。二十二日上午，国民党苏北第九专区专员冯子固由徐州抵达砀山，召开附近省县保安团队长会议，进行内战动员，提出“北进”口号。次日国民党组织的“徐州难民还乡团”百余人，亦由徐到达沛（县）南敬安集，准备作为即将北犯丰（县）沛（县）蒋军的内战先导。苏北蒋军为便利作战运输，已于二十二日开始修筑徐（州）敬（安集）之间的公路，公路沿线两侧之高粱等夏苗全部被毁，致南北五十余里东西一里的广大土地上，已无一点绿色。二十三日，蒋军八十八师即沿新修公路，北开丰（县）沛（县）内战战场之敬安集，大徐庄、新围子等地，伪江苏挺进第一纵队吴品山部，亦由新围子调至徐西之陈庄。国民党苏北清剿第五分区指挥部耿盘勋之第四团，亦由陈庄调至丰县东南的三字楼一带，现苏北丰、沛一带形势已日趋紧张。\n    【焦作卅日电】据本社记者获息：几日以来蒋军又增至新乡十四架Ｐ４７型空军部队，并在新乡城郊建立空军基地，新乡军火库亦结集大量飞机炸弹。空军连日示威演习，准备配合地面部队待机进攻我豫北解放区。另据新乡来人谈：前八天曾目睹蒋军以无数汽车，经大街驰往军火库，当时新乡小组美方人员适在汽车旁经过，立即跟踪追至火药库查看，发现里边已贮有大量美国制造之炸弹，并有汽车正装运炸弹至飞机场。蒋军如此公然违犯执行部停战命令之行动，再一次被证实。美方人员表示非常不满，蒋军亦无法再诡辩。另据信息：蒋军由各地运集新乡军火甚多，装运弹药之军用车，往来频繁，现又强征大批民夫。据估计：此乃对我豫北解放区进攻的新象征。"

In order to prevent Yan's troops from continuing to reinforce and invade along the railway, the local Eighth Route Army resolutely counterattacked and captured Nanguan Station and Yangjiashan, two important locations on the Lingshi-Tongpu Railway, which our army liberated from the enemy and puppet forces on October 28th last year and were occupied by Yan's troops in December. Wangzhuang, an important town north of Huoxian City, was also liberated at the same time, and the Linghuo line has been cut off by our army.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 14th: Xinji, a well-known leather distribution center in North China, has been rebuilt from decline and bankruptcy. Before the War of Resistance, at its peak, Xinji's leather industry had 394 leather merchants and semi-finished product factories, employing over 30,000 leather merchants and workers. More than 20 foreign firms from the United States, Japan, and other countries had offices there, specializing in purchasing and exporting raw hides and furs. Large quantities of hides and furs from the provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Shanxi, and Henan gathered here, underwent some processing, and were then exported through seaports such as Tianjin. During the Japanese occupation, the leather industry suffered damage, eventually leaving only 21 seated merchants. Since Xinji's liberation last August, the local leather industry has transformed from simply supplying raw leather materials to imperialists to manufacturing leather goods needed by the people. Among the 70-plus newly recovered leather merchants, manufacturing plants and leather workshops are the most active. Before the War of Resistance, there were fewer than ten manufacturing plants; now, there are 27. Leather that was previously 80% or more for export is now absorbed by factories and workshops to manufacture leather bags, belts, shoes, and leather whips and ropes for daily use by farmers. Before the War of Resistance, there were 123 leather firms specializing in transshipment and wholesale; now, fewer than 23 have recovered. The reason for this is that the reactionaries have disrupted transportation and freedom of trade, preventing this type of transportation and sales business from developing smoothly. When hides and furs came on the market this spring, each market day (every five days) averaged 17,000 sheepskins, 3,000 miscellaneous hides, and 6,000 cowhides. Industries directly related to the leather industry, such as alkali and oil production, have also largely recovered. Loans from the city's banks and the Border Region Bank branch to the leather industry amounted to over 50 million yuan. Recently, the local government is planning to open a leather-making technology training class to cultivate and improve leather industry personnel and plans to raise 15 million yuan to establish a large leather factory with Japanese machinery and equipment to further prosper the city's leather market.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大量制造人民需用皮货  辛集皮毛业发达\n\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大量制造人民需用皮货\n    辛集皮毛业发达\n    【新华社河间十四日电】华北著名的皮毛松散地束鹿辛集，现已从凋落破产中重建起来。抗战前辛集皮毛业最盛时，有皮毛商及半制品工厂等三百九十四家，经常毛皮商人工人三万余，美日等外商设有洋行二十余家，专门吸收毛运出口，大量的皮毛从绥、察、晋、豫各省，汇集于此，略事加工，即经天津等海港出口。日寇统治时，皮毛业遭受破坏，最后仅剩下坐商二十一家；去秋八月辛苦解放以来，该地皮毛业已由过去只供给帝国主义皮毛原料，转变为制造人民需用皮货。在新恢复之七十余家皮毛商中，以制造厂、皮毛作坊等最为活跃，抗战前制造厂不满十家，现已发展至二十七家。占百分之八十以上运销出口的皮革，现已为工厂作坊吸收，用以制造皮包、皮带、鞋以及农民日常使用的皮鞭绳索等。抗战前专营转运批发的皮庄有一百二十三家，现在恢复的不到二十三家，其原因是反动派破坏交通及贸易自由，此种专事运输皮毛的运销业，不能顺畅发展。今春皮毛上市时，每集（五日）平均有羊皮一万七千张，杂皮三千张，牛皮六千张，直接与皮毛业有关的碱行制油等业，亦大量恢复，该市银行及边区银行支行，对皮革业之贷款即有五千余万元，最近该地政府正筹划开办制革技术讲习班，培养改进皮革业人材，并拟招股一千五百万元，自办具有日本机器设备的大制革厂，以进一步繁荣该市皮毛业市场。"

    "content": "Taiyue's various regions have achieved significant success in indigo planting. This year, Yangcheng's planting area reached over 860 mu, exceeding twenty times the pre-war levels. Currently, various regions are actively extracting indigo dye, estimated to yield at least 70,000 jin of pure indigo. After meeting the county's own needs, approximately 20,000 jin can be exported. Nanguan Village planted 194 mu of indigo, which is expected to produce over 17,000 jin of indigo, with this income accounting for approximately 79% of the village's total actual income. The widespread indigo planting in Yangcheng this year is a result of the government's precise calculations and successful mobilization of the masses during a meeting of local experts in March, illustrating the benefits of indigo planting. In the past, indigo planting was prevalent in the garden areas of Qinshui Chengguan, but almost all of it was abandoned during the enemy's invasion. Last year, after our army liberated Yangcheng, the government called on the masses to restore their old industry. All of the more than 500 mu of garden land were planted with indigo, and it is estimated that 30 million yuan will be harvested this year.\n\n　　[Changzhi News] Under the vigorous promotion of the Lin County government, more than 2,000 mu of indigo were planted this year, resulting in a rich harvest. This will enable the county to be self-sufficient in dyes. Lin County was originally an indigo-producing county, with a large output before the Republic of China era. Later, with the dumping of foreign indigo, it became increasingly unprofitable to plant local indigo, and it gradually disappeared. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the source of foreign indigo has been difficult to obtain, and dyes have been in severe shortage. Last winter, the dyeing price of one chi of cloth even exceeded the price of the cloth itself. Therefore, this year, the county government has vigorously promoted indigo planting, and all places with water-retaining land that could potentially be used for indigo planting have been cultivated as much as possible. As a result, indigo production has been restored.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳种蓝成绩巨大林县染料足以自给  阳城蓝田八百余亩超过战前廿倍\n\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳种蓝成绩巨大林县染料足以自给\n    阳城蓝田八百余亩超过战前廿倍\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳各地种蓝，已获巨大成绩。阳城今年种植面积达八百六十余亩，超过战前二十倍。日前各地正积极打靛，估计至少可出净靛七万斤，除去本县自给外，尚可输出两万斤。南关村种蓝一百九十四亩，可产靛一万七千余斤，此项收入约占全村实收入的百分之七十九。阳城今年普遍种蓝，是三月间全县各行能手座谈会上，政府以精确计算，打通群众思想，说明种蓝有利的结果。沁水城关园地，过去盛行种蓝，在敌寇侵犯期间几乎全部荒芜，去年我军解放阳城，政府号召群众恢复旧业，五百多亩园地全数种蓝，估计今年可收获三千万元。\n    【长治讯】林县经县府极力提倡，今年种靛二千余亩，收获颇丰。可使全县染料自给自足。林县原为产靛县份，民国以前产量甚大。后洋靛倾销，种土靛日益无利，遂告绝迹。抗战以来洋靛来源困难，染料奇缺，去冬染布一尺染价竟超过布价，故今年县府提倡种靛甚力，凡有水地可能种靛地方，都尽量设法栽培，因此靛产又形恢复。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st - Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered his first speech at the third plenary session of the Peace Conference yesterday, accusing the representatives of Australia and the Netherlands of attempting to replace the Foreign Ministers' Conference's two-thirds vote decision with a simple majority vote plan. Molotov revealed that the Australian and Dutch representatives were indeed playing tricks, attempting to achieve a group combination between voting countries. Molotov also cited articles from the Labour Party's Socialist newspaper and the People's Daily to support their argument, which stated: \"A simple majority voting plan will allow the US and Britain to rule everything with twelve votes.\" Molotov stated that the change to the voting rules of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was not based on the interests of peace, but on the interests of the bloc.\n\nThe Program and Rules Committee held its first meeting on the morning of the 30th of last month, with Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj elected as Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee. During the initial discussion, Evatt and Wang Shijie proposed Spaak as a candidate for Chairman of the Committee, and the British and Dutch representatives seconded the motion. Molotov then proposed Kardelj as a candidate, seconded by the Ukrainian and Polish representatives. The conference passed the establishment of one Chairman and one Vice-Chairman each. Molotov also strongly urged the Program and Rules Committee to pass the proposal put forward by Yugoslavia that all conference resolutions require a two-thirds majority vote for passage. Yugoslav representative Pijade believed that the two-thirds rule would be the minimum measure to reach an agreement. He said: \"Justice and lasting peace can only be maintained by the support of the conference's unity, which can guarantee the success of the conference and create a solid foundation for lasting peace.\" However, the Australian and Dutch representatives raised an opposing motion, arguing that a simple majority should be sufficient. No decision was made on this dispute. Pijade also proposed that Albania should become the 22nd country to attend the conference because it had been invaded and destroyed by Italy. The Yugoslav representative also suggested passing a rule giving Albania the right to veto any monitoring of Trieste. The Program and Rules Committee also made no decision on these two points.\n\nIt is also reported that the full text of the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland was published in Paris on the evening of the 30th by the Council of Foreign Ministers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎和会三次大会  莫洛托夫首次演说  斥责澳荷企图推翻原表决方案\n\n1946-08-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎和会三次大会\n    莫洛托夫首次演说\n    斥责澳荷企图推翻原表决方案\n    【新华社延安一日电】苏外长莫洛托夫于昨日在和会的第三次大会上，首次发表演说，斥责澳、荷代表企图以半数票表决方案，代替外长会议三分之二票表决方案的决定。莫氏揭露澳、荷代表确实在玩弄诡计，企图达成投票国家间之集团结合。莫洛托夫并引工党社会党会报、人民报之论文来支持他们的论点，该报称：“过半数票表决方案，将使美英能以十二票统治一切”。莫洛托夫表示对外长会议投票规则之改变，不是从和平利益出发，而是从集团的利益出发。\n    上月卅日晨程序规则委员会举行第一次会议，比外长斯巴克及南斯拉夫副总理卡德尔当选为该委员会之正副主席，最初讨论时，伊瓦特与王世杰提出斯巴克为该委员会主席候选人，英荷代表附议。莫洛托夫则提出卡德尔为候选人，乌克兰及波兰代表附议。大会上通过设立正副主席各一人，莫洛托夫又力促程序规则委员会通过南斯拉夫提出的所有大会决议，皆需要三分之二票数通过的提案，南代表皮雅德认为三分之二的规则，将成为达到协议最低限度的措施。他说：“正义与持久的和平，只有和会一致性的拥护，才能维系，也才能保证大会的成功，并为持久的和平造成强固的基础”。但澳、荷代表提出反对案，主张只需过半数就够了。此一争论未作决定，皮雅德又提议阿尔巴尼亚应成为出席和会的第二十二国，因为该国曾受意大利侵略，并遭受破坏。南代表又建议通过规则，给与该国对的里亚斯特任何监察之否决权。关于该两点，程序规则委员会亦未作出决定。\n    另悉：外长会议对于意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案的全文，已于三十日晚在巴黎公布。"

    "content": "[Changzhi News] Zhang Yaozhong, a cadre of the Fifth District Cooperative of Pingshun, and Zhang Tingfang, a silversmith, have successfully imitated double-strand steel heddles by hand. These heddles can replace foreign steel heddles (a type of steel needle used on looms to separate warp threads into upper and lower layers, about six or seven inches long, with a hole in the middle, each threaded with a warp thread), and are more suitable for native yarn than imported products, being durable, rust-resistant, and cheaper. They have been widely adopted throughout Pingshun County. Under conditions where purchasing steel heddles is difficult, they have greatly helped the development of the local textile industry. The Administrative Office has specially issued a certificate of merit and a reward of 10,000 yuan, and called on other regions to imitate them. Last winter, due to the difficulty in purchasing steel heddles, Zhang Yaozhong approached Zhang Tingxiu to imitate them. Initially, Tingxiu used four liang of iron and manually drew it into iron wire to try to make them, but failed because the iron wire was too hard and there was no welding lathe. Later, copper wire was used to solve the welding problem, but because the copper wire was difficult to make the same length and not straight, it was difficult to keep the middle hole straight. After many studies, single-strand heddles were made, with a price only a little more than one-third of that of foreign steel heddles. After successful trial use, they were welcomed by the masses and sales were brisk, which further encouraged their determination to make double-strand heddles. After another fifty days of research and a loss of more than 3,700 yuan, not only was the double-strand heddle successfully trial-produced, but a complete set of heddle-making tools was created, including a wire drawing lathe, a welding lathe, a drilling machine, and a heading machine. The technology has also gradually improved, and the middle hole of the heddle is smooth and will never snag the yarn. A small factory has now been set up to manufacture them, producing 1,500 heddles per day. The manufacturing process is as follows: first, thick steel wire or iron wire is drawn into thin wire, and after being burned three or four times, it is immersed in yellow alum liquid to remove rust. Then, the two strands of wire are joined and wound on a welding lathe wheel, and the two wires are tinned and welded at the hole to complete the process.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平顺张耀中张廷秀  仿制钢＠成功  行署特发万元奖励\n长治讯\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平顺张耀中张廷秀  仿制钢＠成功\n    行署特发万元奖励\n    【长治讯】平顺五区区联社干部张耀中及银匠张廷芳，手工仿制之双股＠已告成功。此＠可代替外来钢＠（织布机上用以分经线为上下两层之一种钢针，约六、七寸长，中有孔，每根绾经线一条），用于土纱且较舶来品为宜，耐用不锈，价钱便宜，平顺全县已普遍采用。在购买钢＠困难的条件下，对本区纺织业发展帮助很大。行署特颁发奖状及奖金万元，并号召各地仿制。去冬因钢＠购买困难，张耀中即约同张廷秀仿制，最初廷秀以四两铁用手工拔成铁丝试造，结果因铁丝太硬与没有焊车而失败。后改用铜丝，解决了焊结问题，但因铜丝长短难齐和不直。中孔很难留正，又经多次研究始造成单股＠，价格仅及外来钢＠的三分之一强。经试用成功，群众欢迎，销路畅旺，这更鼓励了他们造双股＠的决心。又经五十天的研究，赔本三千七百余元，不仅双股＠试造成功，并创造了一全套造＠工具，包括拔丝车、焊丝车、钻孔机、上头机等，技术亦逐渐提高，＠中孔光滑，绝不挂纱。现已设有小型工厂制造，日出一千五百根。制造过程为：先将粗钢丝或铁丝拔成细丝，经火烧三、四次后浸入黄矾液中去锈，然后将两股丝并缠于焊车轮上将两丝留孔上锡焊好即成。"

To date, there are a total of 67 secondary and higher education institutions in the entire border region, with more than 13,000 students; universities and specialized schools have reached 14, with 3,840 students; vocational schools number 5, with 913 students; middle schools number 30, with 6,225 students; and normal schools number 18, with 2,123 students. Advanced schools such as North China United University, Bethune Medical University (established by merging Bethune School and China Medical University), Military Region Military and Political Cadre School, Border Region Administrative Cadre School, Railway College, Inner Mongolia College, Border Region Institute of Technology, Agricultural College, Commercial College, Jin-Dong National Construction College, Rehe Inner Mongolia College, Military and Political Cadre School, etc., mostly absorb various cadres with rich practical experience for further study. At the same time, young students from the Kuomintang-controlled areas such as Tianjin, Chongqing, and Shanghai are also very enthusiastic to enroll. Secondary education is generally divided into two types: cadre training and preparatory schooling. In addition to the government providing all expenses for the children of anti-Japanese soldiers and martyrs whose families are poor, or for young students from outside the liberated areas, a large number of self-funded students are also recruited. Normal education is generally divided into simple normal schools and ordinary normal schools. The former is run by each county to specialize in training primary school teachers; the latter is run by special commissioner's offices and above to train senior elementary school teachers and lower-level educational administrative cadres. In addition, each county uses teacher holidays to conduct short-term teacher training courses. In the Jin-Ji area, more than 5,500 teachers have been trained in half a year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋察冀教育发展  中等及专科以上学校共一百三十四所\n\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋察冀教育发展\n    中等及专科以上学校共一百三十四所\n    【新华社张家口二十七日电】晋察冀边区学校教育有长足发展，现有中等及专科以上学校一百三十四所，学生二万六千一百人。抗战中边区曾缔造华北联大，抗战建国学院，白求恩卫生学校及二十余处中学，培养和供给了军事、行政、经济、文艺、教育等战线上的四万六千余名优秀干部。抗战胜利后，为适应民主建设要求，各级民主政府更兴办中等、专科以上学校，迄今全边区中等以上学校共计六十七处，学生一万三千余人；大学及专门学校已达十四处，学生三千八百四十名；职业学校五处，学生九百一十三名；中学三十处，学生六千二百二十五名；师范学校十八处，学生二千一百二十三名。高级学校如华北联大、白求恩医大（系白校与中国医大合并设立）、军区军政干校、边区行政干部学校、铁路学院、内蒙学院、边区工专、农专、商专、晋东建国学院、热河内蒙学院、军政干部学校等，大部吸收具有丰富实际经验的各种干部予以深造，同时平津渝沪等国民党统治区前来入学的青年学生亦极踊跃。中等教育一般分训练干部及预备升学两种，除抗属子弟家境贫寒或解放区以外入学之青年学生由政府供给全部费用外，并大量招收自费生。师范教育一般分为简师与普通师范两种，前者由各县主办，专门训练初小教员；后者由专署以上主办，训练高小及下级教育行政干部。此外各县并利用教师假期，进行短期师资轮训班，冀晋区半年训练教师五千五百余名。"

There are now more than thirty kinds of democratic newspapers. Northern Korea has trade unions in various industries. In Pyongyang alone, there are eighteen central trade union committees, and the \"Workers' Newspaper\" is published. Workers have the freedom to express their opinions in the newspaper. The political line of the trade unions completely supports the decision of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers on Korea. They are fighting for the establishment of a democratic and independent Korea so that the democracy of Northern Korea can be extended to all parts of Korea. The trade unions have carried out tremendous mass work, publicizing the resolution of the Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers on the Korean issue and exposing the activities of reactionaries such as Kim Koo.

Before the War of Resistance, the area produced 160,000 \"kuai\" (each kuai weighing 40 taels) of silk annually, worth approximately 4 million taels of silver. After the area fell under enemy occupation, silk cocoons could not be exported, Northeast cocoon seeds could not be purchased, and silk producers faced extremely heavy burdens. By the spring of 1933, the silk industry had come to a complete standstill. In the autumn of 1943, after the Eighth Route Army liberated the area, annual silk production jumped to over 10,000 \"kuai\" that same year. In the spring of 1945, the government provided loans and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce took responsibility for resolving difficulties for silkworm farmers and purchasing cocoons and silk. That year, silk production surged again to over 36,000 \"kuai\". This spring, a Sericulture Guidance Center was established, setting up breeding farms and reeling and weaving factories, along with a group of technicians, extension workers, and trainees. The breeding farms specialize in providing silkworm farmers with high-quality silkworm eggs and researching silkworm rearing methods and preventing diseases. The reeling and weaving factories are improving reeling and weaving methods, increasing silk production quality, and researching the weaving of serge and twill. Extension workers provide demonstrations and guidance, organize production and sales cooperatives, and oversee loan matters. This spring, the center has already issued 500,000 yuan in loans. If the oak leaves are not damaged by pests this autumn, it is possible that 160,000 \"kuai\" of silk will be produced. With each \"kuai\" valued at 700 yuan, it is estimated that income may exceed 100 million yuan. Currently, the silk reeling factory is busy increasing its machinery to welcome the arrival of autumn cocoons.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 滨海诸城莒县一带  柞蚕业恢复战前水平\n\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　滨海诸城莒县一带\n    柞蚕业恢复战前水平\n    【新华社临沂三十一日电】滨海解放区诸城、莒县、日照一带著名的榨蚕丝业，在民主政府扶助下已迅速恢复战前水平。该区在抗战前年产丝十六万块（每块四十两），价值约四百余万两银子。自沦陷以后，丝茧不能出口，东北茧种无法购运，丝户负担奇重。二十二年春，丝业即完全陷入停顿状态。三十二年秋，八路军解放该区后，当年产丝量即一跃上升至一万余块。三十四年春政府予以贷款，并由工商管理局负责替蚕民解决困难，收买茧丝，是年丝产量复激增至三万六千余块。今春复成立蚕业指导所，设置育种场与缫织场，及一批技术员推广员与练习生。育种场专供蚕民以优良蚕种，并研究育蚕法及预防病害等事宜。缫织场则改良缫织方法，提高丝产质量，研究织哔叽与斜纹呢。推广员作示范指导，组织产销合作社，主持贷款事宜。该所今春已发放贷款五十万元，今秋如红叶不遭虫害，即可能产丝十六万块，每块以七百元计算，预计可收入一万万余元。现缫丝场正忙着增加机件，迎接秋茧上市。"

After the dumping of American cigarettes, 80% of the local cigarette factories have closed down. With the arrival of daily-use cosmetics, the chemical industry has also collapsed one after another. Due to the large number of glass and silk products shipped from Shanghai, the silk and cloth industry is in a state of panic. According to the statistics of the Chongqing Direct Taxation Bureau, 137 private factories and 107 large companies and firms closed down in May and June. Market transactions of more than 100 million yuan in May and June were very rare. From Qingnian Road to Xiaoshizi Road, 13 foreign sundry goods and clothing companies announced their closure or transfer in the second half of June alone. Tax revenue decreased by two-fifths, reflecting the extremely serious depression of industry and commerce. Furthermore, it is reported that Peiping (now Beijing), the ancient capital, has begun to be attacked by American goods. Cheap goods such as American Cream of Wheat have appeared in Bao'an Market and Wangfudajie. The windows of department stores are full of glass products, called \"Glass World.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: It is reported that Mr. Lu Zuofu, General Manager of Minsheng Company, rushed to Nanjing on July 9th to make an urgent appeal to all parties for relief. This is because the company has been operating on the Yichang-Chongqing section recently, with very little transportation of local goods, all dispatched by the Kuomintang authorities. On July 7th, Chiang Kai-shek sent another urgent telegram to Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Kuomintang military and political organs stationed in Chongqing, \"ordering Minsheng Company to stop all commercial cargo and passenger transportation and to devote all its efforts to transporting Sichuan grain out of Sichuan.\" The company has already lost more than 3 billion yuan due to military service in the five months from January to June this year. If this appeal does not receive concrete relief measures, it will inevitably close down and suspend business.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Kaifeng News: The Kuomintang garrison in Henan Province numbers 870,000, with extensive requisitions. The Kuomintang Central Government only allocated military grain for 380,000 people, leaving the remaining 490,000 to disturb the people on their own, placing a heavy burden on military grain. According to a public report by the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs in early July, supplementary food expenses and horse fodder expenses alone amounted to more than 630,000 yuan per month. In addition to the salaries and grain of the provincial and county teams, the people of Henan, suffering from wind, rain, hail, insects, fog, water, and locust plagues, could not bear it. Some provincial assembly members organized a crying delegation in late June to petition the authorities in Nanjing to reduce the burden on the people, but no results have been seen so far.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Shanghai News: More than 500 civil servants from over ten units directly under the Kuomintang Central Government, including the Cargo Direct Depot and the Tax Bureau, have repeatedly telegraphed the authorities to improve their living conditions due to high living pressure, but have not received a reply. They are preparing to start a general leave of absence and will hold a press conference on the 12th to report on their difficult living conditions. Furthermore, it is reported that accounting personnel from various units under the Xiamen Municipal Government jointly signed a petition to the mayor on the 10th, requesting ten days of leave in order to beg from door to door due to rising prices.

London dispatch: The Manchester Guardian, the organ of the British Liberal Party, commented on the Chinese situation and American policy on the 24th, stating that the Chinese civil war and economic situation are \"distressing.\" Regarding the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the report stated that the CCP refused to withdraw its troops from the occupied areas or abolish local governments until it was convinced that Chiang Kai-shek was sincere in organizing a coalition government and ending one-party dictatorship; while Chiang Kai-shek was unwilling to take such steps before the main rivers and railways were decisively placed under the control of the central government. The report pointed out: \"Most observers believe that the Communist Party's suspicions are more justified.\" The report continued: \"There are many liberal and progressive figures in the Kuomintang who genuinely admire democracy, but behind them are powerful forces, especially in the army and police, who do not hide their hatred of the Communist Party. These people incite Chiang Kai-shek (Editor's note: In fact, Chiang Kai-shek is the leader of such people) to annihilate the Communist Party while the Kuomintang army can still rely on American support. These people include large landowners and corrupt officials in various provinces. For them, the destruction of China is not a big deal as long as it does not harm their interests.\" Regarding the US policy towards China, the report stated: \"In this situation in China, the United States has a major responsibility. In any case, the US government has supported the central government with military force during and after the war. The Kuomintang army is trained and equipped by the US military, and American weapons are often transported by US ships and planes. Marshall cannot hide the fact that the existence of the central government depends on American economic assistance. The US policy could be justified if it promoted some progress towards peace and democracy between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but it has not achieved this. In the areas controlled by the Communist Party, it is sufficient to prove that their administration is more effective and more popular than what the Kuomintang has done.\" The report concluded: \"If after the US military has been stationed in China for a year, there is no good sign other than continuing the civil war and economic chaos, then it will be even more difficult to justify the US military's presence in China.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英自由党机关报著文称  中国内战美应负责  指责蒋介石无理固执独裁\n\n1946-08-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英自由党机关报著文称\n    中国内战美应负责         \n    指责蒋介石无理固执独裁\n    【新华社延安一日电】伦敦讯：英自由党机关报曼彻斯特导报于二十四日评论中国形势与美国政策称：中国的内战与经济局势“令人痛心”。关于国共之谈判，该报称：中共在未确信蒋介石对组织联合政府、结束一党专政确具诚意前，拒绝撤退其占领区之军队或撤销地方政权；而蒋介石在主要的河流与铁路未决定地置于中央政府管制之前，或不愿采取这种步骤。该报指出：“多数观察家以为共产党的怀疑比较有理由”。该报继称：“国民党中有不少自由进步的人物，他们真心真意地崇尚民主，但是在他们背后是强大的势力，尤其是陆军与警察方面，他们并不愿隐藏其对中共的仇视，这种人煽动蒋介石（编者按：实际上蒋介石正是上述这种人之首脑），在国民党军队依然能够依赖美国支持的时候，歼灭共产党。这些人包括各省的大地主、腐败官吏等。对于他们，只要不损害他们的利益，中国的毁灭也没有多大关系”。该报关于美国对华政策称：“在中国这种局势下，美国负有重大责任，不论如何，美国政府在战时及战后以兵力支持了中央政府，国民党军队是由美军训练配备，美国武器时常由美轮与飞机运送。马歇尔不能隐藏这个事实，即中央政府的存在，依赖美国的经济协助。美国的政策，如为促进国共间和平民主的若干进步，则即可说明它的正当，但是它没有这种成就。在共产党管制的区域内，足以证明他们的行政比国民党所做到的更为有效，更得民心”。该报结语称：“如果美军在中国驻了一年之后，除继续内战与经济混乱之外，别无好现象，那么要证明美军驻华的正当，更是困难了”。"

    "content": "[Heze News] A rally of over 20,000 citizens in Heze City to accuse the German and Dutch war criminals of the Japanese寇 Fifth Column, Gao Tianda and ten others, of their crimes, lasting three days, has concluded with initial success. Around the 15th of last month, the Municipal Government successively received over a hundred indictments from the masses accusing eleven German and Dutch war criminals, including He Fangji, Gao Tianda, Tao He, Majialuo, Nai Tianzhen, and Dabaier, of using the guise of priests to help the Japanese寇 attack the Chinese mainland and massacre Chinese compatriots. After careful investigation, the Municipal Government obtained conclusive and sufficient evidence and arrested them at the request of the people. The indictment began on the 15th, and people from over a hundred miles away got up in the middle of the night, carrying lanterns and torches to testify. The conference was held in the scorching sun of July for three days, and the emotions of the masses remained extremely angry. The loudspeaker first broadcast the excited voice of citizen Shi Xiuzhong, who accused Majialuo of manufacturing batteries for the traitor Wang Xian to supply the enemy's communication. The masses of Li Balao Village, sixty miles away from Heze City, accused the German priest Xue with unparalleled anger, that on September 13th of the 32nd year of the Republic, he led the Japanese寇 to the village and killed twelve civilians and thirteen Eighth Route Army soldiers, and looted more than a hundred rifles from the Eighth Route Army and militiamen, and smashed 130 cooking pots of the masses, making it impossible for the masses to cook. Then, twenty-three people successively listed facts accusing them of directly harming the masses in collusion with the Japanese寇 and traitors. Wang Wenbao accused them of relying on the Japanese寇 to plunder two million catties of lime, 1.7 million bricks, and 2,000 tons of timber, which were public building materials stored in the Catholic Church; the materials were originally donated by twelve counties near Heze City before the July 7th Incident to build a model prison in Heze. When Li Zhankui, Wang Kaichen and others accused the criminals of unreasonably occupying their houses and converting them into foreign-style buildings, leaving them with nowhere to live, the whole audience shouted slogans, their voices piercing the sky. Businessman Wang Qu accused them of colluding with the Japanese寇 to rob and divide all the things that the merchants had stored in the Catholic Church. Zhang Hongliang angrily accused priest Ge of raping female parishioners under the guise of kneeling to scriptures. Ge once called two girls from the Zhangjia Mountain to his private room to kneel to scriptures and raped them for three days before releasing them. Many white-haired old women and young girls accused these war criminals of killing more than seventy of their relatives under the pretext of treating diseases as priests. Only 122 people had the opportunity to accuse at the meeting, and many who did not have time to speak submitted indictments. More than 20,000 people unanimously demanded that the government handle the matter according to law. Mayor Zhao of Heze City stated that the consistent policy of the liberated areas is to protect law-abiding foreign nationals, but war criminals who, under false pretenses and using various disguises, infiltrate the Chinese mainland and collaborate with the Japanese寇 to persecute the people will be given due sanctions according to law. The government, based on these specific facts of crimes and the opinions of the masses, has decided to deal with them according to law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 荷泽两万余人集会  控诉德荷籍战犯罪行   解放区保护守法外侨，但对配合日寇残害人民的战犯决予以应得之制裁\n\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　荷泽两万余人集会\n    控诉德荷籍战犯罪行\n    解放区保护守法外侨，但对配合日寇\n    残害人民的战犯决予以应得之制裁\n    【本报荷泽讯】荷市市民两万余人集会控诉日寇第五纵队德荷籍战争罪犯高天达等十一人之罪行，历时三日，已初步胜利结束。上月十五日前后，市府陆续收到群众控诉德荷籍战争罪犯何方济、高天达、陶贺、马加罗、奈天真、达柏尔等十一人的控诉状百余件，揭露彼等以神甫外衣为掩护，帮助日寇进攻中国本土，残杀中国同胞的罪行。市府经详密调查，获得确凿充分的证据后，即应人民之请将彼等逮捕。十五日开始控诉，百里外群众亦半夜起身，打着灯笼火把纷纷赶来作证。大会在七月的烈日中进行三日，群众情绪始终愤激异常。播音机首先传出市民史秀中激动的声音，他控告马加罗为汉奸王宪制造电池，供给敌人的电讯联系。距荷市六十里的李八老庄群众，以无比的愤怒控诉德籍薛神甫于民国三十二年九月十三日，领着日寇到该村杀死老百姓十二人和八路军战士十三人，并劫去八路军和民兵步枪百余枝，打碎群众作饭锅一百三十口，使群众无法举炊。接着有二十三人先后列举事实，控诉他们伙同日寇、汉奸直接残害群众的罪行。王文保控诉彼等依仗日寇，抢掠存放天主堂之公共建筑材料——石灰二百万斤，砖百七十万块，木料二千吨；该项材料原系七七事变前荷市附近十二县捐募来荷建造模范监狱者。当李占魁、王开臣等控诉该犯等将他们的房子无理占去改筑洋楼，使他无处栖身时，全场怒呼口号，声澈云霄。商人王区控诉彼等伙同日寇，把商人们存放在天主堂的东西统统抢掠分了赃。张洪亮义愤填胸地控诉葛神甫假借跪经强奸教女之罪行，葛曾把张家山两个姑娘叫到他私室去跪经，强奸三天后才放出来。许多白发老婆婆和年轻的姑娘控诉这些战犯以神甫治病为名，害死了自己七十多口亲人。会上获得控诉机会的仅一百二十二人，许多未及发言的，都递了控诉书。两万余人一致要求政府依法处理，荷市赵市长声称：解放区保护守法外侨，原为一贯实行的政策，但对于假借名目，利用各种伪装，潜入中国内地，配合日寇残害人民的战争罪犯，则依法予以应得之制裁。政府根据这些具体罪恶事实及群众意见，决依法进行处理。"

He also said, \"I am deeply moved by Chairman Chiang's generous statement.\" According to the Central News Agency, \"Yoshida regrets that Japan lacks diplomatic relations to formally thank the Chinese National Government, expresses his apologies, and hopes to find a way to express his gratitude.\" People in Yan'an feel that Yoshida Shigeru's \"gratitude\" to Chiang Kai-shek is not without reason. In his speech on August 15th last year, Chiang Kai-shek declared that \"we must love our enemies\" and \"not dwell on past grievances.\" Under this policy, in addition to incorporating Japanese puppet troops and condoning the top war criminal Yasuji Okamura's residence in Nanjing without trial, the Chiang Kai-shek government, under MacArthur's direction, also sold out China's rights, such as allowing Japanese fishing boats to fish along the Chinese coast, damaging China's fishing industry and infringing on China's territorial waters.\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Tokyo dispatch: The Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers notified the Japanese government on the 29th of last month that the Supreme Commander did not oppose the Japanese government's plan to collect taxes from non-Japanese residents in Japan, except for personnel of the occupation forces and the Supreme Commander's headquarters. Note: This statement by the Allied Headquarters is in response to the fact that Japanese police shot Taiwanese people for not being able to pay the high taxes stipulated by the Japanese side. Japanese financial cliques then instructed the police to forcibly evict them from their stalls.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石有辱国体  吉田茂对蒋宽容战犯，表示“感激”！\n\n1946-08-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋介石有辱国体\n    吉田茂对蒋宽容战犯，表示“感激”！\n    【新华社延安一日电】据中央社七月三十日东京专电称：日首相吉田茂在众院预算会上答复进步党议员质问时，对蒋主席在日本投降后加诸在华日侨之宽大为怀，“表示感激”。并称：“蒋主席之宽大声明，本人极为感动”。据中央社称：“吉田惜日本外交关系现尚缺乏，无法向中国国民政府申谢，表示歉意，希望设法致谢”。延安人士咸感吉田茂对蒋介石之“感激”，不是没有原因的。蒋介石在去年八月十五日演讲中，即曾宣称“要爱敌人”，要“不念旧恶”，在这一方针之下，除了收编日伪军，纵容头号战犯冈村＠次安居南京迟迟不加审判外，蒋介石政府还在麦克阿瑟指使之下，出卖中国的权利，例如议日本渔船在中国沿海捉鱼，损害了中国的渔业，侵犯了中国的领海主权。\n    【新华社延安一日电】东京讯：盟军最高统帅部上月二十九日通知日本政府，该统帅部不反对日政府征收日本境内非日本侨民赋税的计划，但占领军与该统帅部的人员例外。按：盟军总部此一声明，系针对日警枪杀台人因无钱缴纳日方规定的高度赋税，日财阀即指使警察以暴力驱逐出搭火摊之地。"

    "content": "【Heze, 30th Dispatch】 The Kuomintang authorities in Northern Jiangsu, in collaboration with puppet troops, fraudulently obtained relief flour and used it as military rations for the civil war. Wu Pinshan's puppet troops, entrenched in Jing'anji (50 li northwest of Xuzhou) in Northern Jiangsu, have ravaged the area bordering Pei County and Yutai in Jiangsu and Shandong for many years, causing severe famine. After Wu, a traitor, was incorporated into the Chiang Kai-shek army, he actively engaged in the civil war. Recently, he attacked Feng County and Pei County in Northern Jiangsu. In order to cooperate with the Chiang Kai-shek army, this traitor shamelessly defrauded relief flour by falsely claiming the famine he himself had created and applying to the relief administration for aid. The Kuomintang authorities simultaneously carried out deception, and the relief administration approved a large amount of supplies to relieve the refugees in Northern Jiangsu. On the 11th, 14th, and 15th of this month, 9,000 bags of flour were transported from Xuzhou to Jing'anji on the front lines of the civil war. Wu and Kuomintang officials temporarily drove tens of thousands of civilians within dozens of li around the area who were building fortifications, pretending that they were refugees to receive the relief flour, which was then moved into military granaries. Furthermore, they selected fleeing local bullies from the \"Refugee Repatriation Corps\" organized by special agents, posing them as refugee representatives to deceive foreign personnel from UNRRA distributing relief supplies with flowery words. After this shameful farce of defrauding grain was staged, the vast disaster-stricken people in the local area who were crying out for food were extremely indignant.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋伪骗取救济面粉充作内战军粮\n\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋伪骗取救济面粉充作内战军粮\n    【荷泽三十日电】苏北国民党当局协同伪军骗取救济面粉充作内战军粮。盘据苏北敬安集（徐州西北五十里）之伪军吴品山部，蹂躏苏鲁边沛县鱼台一带多年，造成严重灾荒。吴逆自被蒋军收编后，积极从事内战，最近，进攻我苏北丰县沛县。该逆竟为配合蒋军，无耻骗取救济面粉，乃以其一手造成之灾荒，向救济总署声请救济。国民党当局同时进行瞒哄，救济总署乃批准大量物资救济苏北难民，于本月十一、十四、十五三日由徐州运送面粉九千袋至内战前线的敬安集，吴逆及国民党官员临时驱使周围数十里内正在修筑工事之数万民夫，冒充难民领取救济面粉，旋即搬入军粮仓库，又由特务组织的“难民还乡团”中抽选逃亡恶霸，冒充难民代表，以花言巧语蒙蔽发放救济粮之联总外籍人员。在此项骗粮丑剧演出后，当地嗷嗷待哺之广大灾民愤恨异常。"

    "date": "1946-08-04",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "On the Anping Town Incident\n　　*Liberation Daily* Editorial\n　　A patrol team of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, China, along with units of the Kuomintang army, suddenly patrolled near Anping Town, about 70 kilometers northeast of Tianjin, on the morning of the 29th. They intruded into the defense area of the Eighth Route Army in eastern Hebei and attacked the local garrison. The garrison was forced to defend itself, resulting in casualties on both sides. Not only did the U.S. military fail to admit their mistake, but they also reinforced their troops and deployed U.S. Air Force to cooperate. A certain \"high-ranking military officer\" of the Kuomintang in Beiping regarded the foreign troops' slaughter of Chinese people on Chinese territory as supreme glory and expressed utmost gratitude. However, he described the Chinese people's legitimate self-defense against the foreign troops' invasion as \"a barbaric act, whether planned by the CCP itself or instigated by others.\" The Kuomintang reactionaries are clearly trying to drag the U.S. military into the vortex of the Chinese civil war, and the aggressors within the U.S. military are also deliberately throwing themselves into this vortex, desperately challenging the Chinese people.\n\n　　The landing of U.S. troops in China after Japan's surrender was, in itself, a mistake, violating the will of the peace-loving American people and the American soldiers who wanted to return home. The continued stationing of U.S. troops in North China after the so-called task of repatriating prisoners of war in North China had ended, delaying their withdrawal, was an even greater mistake. The CCP and the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas openly opposed these mistakes by the U.S. authorities. However, in order to preserve the friendship between the Chinese and American people, the CCP and the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas have never taken hostile actions against the U.S. military. Yet the U.S. military has not only openly sided with the Kuomintang, guarding ports and railways for the Kuomintang army, but has also frequently provoked the Liberated Areas. Not to mention anything else, in eastern Hebei alone, according to the Eighth Route Army's eastern Hebei military region, there were incidents such as four U.S. troops from Linxi entering the Liberated Area of Luan County for reconnaissance and photography on June 10; four U.S. troops from Tangshan harassing Songjiaying and other places in the Liberated Area on June 16; more than ten U.S. troops from the 52nd bridge of the Beining Railway demonstrating in Sanhezhuangzi, Luan County, in three tanks on July 11; and seven U.S. troops from Liushouying of the Beining Railway invading Xihe and Nancun in Changli, opening fire on local militia and being detained by the militia on July 13. In particular, regarding the Liushouying incident, the U.S. representative and the U.S. troops involved had formally admitted the mistake of the U.S. military invading the Liberated Area. Who knew that only half a month later, the same eastern Hebei suffered an even more serious attack by the U.S. military. This situation cannot but arouse our great vigilance.\n\n　　Standing on the position of the Chinese people, we first demand that the U.S. Marine Corps in Tianjin apologize for the Anping Town incident, pay compensation, punish the directly responsible officers, and publicly guarantee that they will no longer invade the Liberated Areas. However, this is only a temporary solution. In order to solve the root cause, we reiterate our demand that all U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel stationed in China immediately withdraw to their country. We believe that the majority of officers and soldiers of the U.S. troops stationed in China do not want to be stationed in China inexplicably and unwelcomely, and we also believe that they have no ill will towards the Chinese people and the Chinese Liberated Areas. However, they are stationed in China, where the civil war is increasingly expanding, stationed among Kuomintang strongholds surrounded by the Liberated Areas, and cooperating so closely with the Kuomintang army. Then it is difficult for them to avoid being involved in intrusions and attacks on the Liberated Areas, and these intrusions and attacks will naturally cause legitimate self-defensive resistance. If the situation were reversed and these American officers and soldiers were in the position of the Chinese people, they would have already carried out this self-defensive resistance. The military and civilians in the Liberated Areas have tolerated the actions of the U.S. military for a long time, but no matter how tolerant we are, there is a limit. We are patriots with national self-esteem, and we also love the friendship between the two great nations of China and the the United States. Precisely to prevent this friendship from being harmed, and to prevent U.S. military officers and soldiers from being involved in the instigation and deception of Chinese reactionaries and American reactionaries, becoming their meaningless sacrifices, we demand that all U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel stationed in China immediately withdraw to their country.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 论安平镇事件  解放日报社论\n\n1946-08-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　论安平镇事件\n    解放日报社论\n    驻中国天津美海军陆战队巡逻队以及国民党军各一部，二十九日上午忽然巡逻到天津东北约七十公里的安平镇附近，侵入冀东八路军防地，并向当地守军攻击，守军被迫自卫，双方都有死伤；美军不但没有认错，反而实行增援，并有美空军出动配合。而国民党北平“某高级军事长官”对于外国军队在中国领土上屠杀中国人民，竟引为无上光荣，表示无上感激；对中国人民向外国军队侵略行动所实行的正当自卫，却说是“无论此事系由中共自行计划或由他人授意，同系野蛮行动”。国民党反动派显然是在竭力把美军牵入中国内战漩涡，而美军中的侵略分子也在故意投入这个漩涡，竭力向中国人民挑战。\n    美军在日本投降以后在中国登陆，这件事本身已经是一个错误，已经违反要求和平的美国人民和要求回国的美国士兵的意志；美军在所谓华北遣俘任务已经结束以后，仍然留驻华北，迟迟不退，这更加是一个错误。中共和解放区的军民，公开反对美国当局的这些错误。但是为了顾全中美人民的友谊，中共和解放区军民从没有对美军采取敌对行动，而美军方面却不但露骨的和国民党站在一起，为国民党军看守港口铁路，而且往往向解放区挑衅。远的不要说，只在最近冀东一地，据八路军冀东军区发表，就有六月十日林西美军四名，进入滦县解放区侦察摄影；六月十六日，唐山美军四名到解放区宋家营等地滋扰；七月十一日，北宁路五十二号桥美军十余名，乘坦克三辆，在滦县三河庄子示威；七月十三日，北宁路留守营美军七名侵入昌黎西河、南村，向当地民兵开枪射击，被民兵扣留等事件。特别是关于留守营事件，美方代表和肇事美军本人，都曾正式承认美军侵入解放区的错误。谁知事情才过去半个月，同一个冀东，又遭受了美军更严重的进攻，这种情形不能不唤起我们的重大警惕。\n    我们站在中国人民的立场上，对于安平镇事件，首先要求天津美国海军陆战队的道歉、赔偿，处分直接负责的军官，并公开保证不再向解放区侵扰。但是这只是治标的办法，为了治本，我们重申要求美国驻华一切海陆空军立即撤退回国。我们相信，驻华美军的大多数官兵并不愿意莫明其妙的、不受欢迎的驻在中国，我们也相信他们对于中国人民和中国解放区并无恶感，但是他们驻在内战正在日趋扩大的中国，驻在被解放区所包围的国民党据点中间，又和国民党军如此密切合作，那么他们是很难避免牵入对于解放区的侵扰和进攻，而这种侵扰和进攻会自然引起正当的自卫性抵抗的。如果易地而处，这些美国官兵处在中国人民的地位，他们早就进行这种自卫的抵抗了。解放区军民曾经对美军的行动容忍得很久，但是无论怎样容忍，总有个限度，我们是有民族自尊心的爱国者，我们同时也爱中美两大民族的友谊，正是为了这种友谊不被伤害，为了美军官兵不致牵入中国反动派和美国反动派的挑拨诡计，成为他们的无意义的牺牲品，我们要求驻华美国一切海陆空军立即撤退回国。"

According to Zhuang Yanfeng, a clerk in the Intelligence Section of the Staff Department of the puppet army under traitor Zhao Baoyuan, captured by the Shandong Eighth Route Army in the campaign to suppress the traitors: Xin was unreasonably detained by Zhao's troops at Caijia Village on May 20th while traveling by car from Gaomi back to the residence of the Fifth Brigade of the Eighth Route Army. He was taken to Zhao Jilian, the major operations staff officer of the Operations Section of Zhao's Staff Department, where he was subjected to all kinds of insults. At about 10 p.m., Zhao suddenly sent a squad of more than ten men from the Special Service Company to forcibly tie up Xin. At that time, Xin sternly condemned and resisted vigorously, but Zhao Jilian and others were extremely brutal and violently beat him, leaving him covered in injuries, and finally strangled him to death with a rope. The above facts were all witnessed by Zhuang Yanfeng himself. Afterwards, Zhao ordered: \"Whoever leaks this will be arrested and shot.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Beiping dispatch: The illegal detention and inspection by the Kuomintang secret service in Ping of the CCP personnel and luggage from Zhangjiakou to Ping on the 16th of last month has been investigated by the Special Group of the Military Mediation Department and resolved on the 19th. Since the incident occurred, after the CCP representatives of the Military Mediation Department lodged a protest, the department formed a special group composed of representatives from the US side (Fu Rao Men), the Kuomintang (Jia Chunyun), and the CCP (Lei Yingfu) on the 17th. At 3:30 p.m. that afternoon, they went directly to the Kuomintang secret service on Jingshan East Street to conduct an investigation. The US representative pointed out on the spot that the Military Mediation Department is a diplomatic organ and should enjoy immunity from inspection, and Command Order No. 4 has clear provisions, and the truck and luggage should be returned to the Military Mediation Department for disposal. However, Li Yuanren, the person in charge of the secret service, brazenly refused on the pretext of \"maintaining local security\" and according to the \"defense zone\" laws. The investigation did not yield results that day. On the morning of the 18th, the special group met again, and the Kuomintang representative announced that \"General Jiang Wenzhi, the chief of staff of the government, has ordered the local authorities to carry out compulsory inspections, so the meeting is no longer necessary,\" almost bringing the negotiations to a stalemate. The CCP insisted that Command Order No. 4 should not be violated, but in order to demonstrate its openness and uprightness, it voluntarily opened the luggage and invited representatives of the group to inspect it, but sternly rejected the participation of the Kuomintang secret service and police. On the 19th, the three members of the Executive Headquarters held a meeting and unanimously agreed that the illegal organ (i.e., the Kuomintang secret service on Jingshan East Street) had no right to inspect the luggage and trucks of the Executive Headquarters. After further efforts by the special group, Li Yuanren unreasonably resisted, and the trucks and luggage were released at 6 p.m. that day and driven back to the Military Mediation Department. At 7 p.m., the CCP side of the Military Mediation Department opened the detained luggage itself and invited representatives of the special group to inspect it. All items were clothing, bedding, money, newspapers, etc., and there were no so-called contraband items inside. Thus, the illegal detention and inspection incident by the Kuomintang secret service was declared over after dragging on for three full days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 高密小组中共代理人  辛冠五氏惨遭杀害  赵逆保元罪无可＠\n\n1946-08-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　高密小组中共代理人\n    辛冠五氏惨遭杀害           \n    赵逆保元罪无可＠\n    【新华社莱阳一日电】军调部高密第二十一交通小组中共代理人辛冠五氏失踪事件，现经目睹者证明，已惨遭杀害。据山东八路军在讨逆战役中俘获之伪军赵逆保元部参谋处谍报科勤务庄严风供称：辛氏于五月二十日由高密乘车返八路军五旅驻地，途经蔡家庄时，突被赵部无理扣押至赵逆参谋处作战科少校作战参谋赵吉廉处，即遭百般侮辱。至下午十时许，赵逆突派来特务连一个班十余人，强行捆绑辛氏，当时辛氏曾严词指责，奋力抗拒，但赵吉廉等蛮横异常，凶加毒打，遍体鳞伤，终被用绳子勒死。以上事实经过，均系庄严风亲目所睹，事后赵逆曾下令：“谁泄露就捉来枪毙”。\n    【新华社延安一日电】北平讯：上月十六日，平市国民党特务机关非法扣检由张家口抵平之军调部中共人员及行李事件，业经军调部特别小组调查，于十九日获得解决。自该事件发生，军调部中共代表提出抗议后，十七日该部即由富饶门（美方）、贾春云（国民党）、雷英夫（中共）三方代表组成特别小组，于是日下午三时半，迳赴景山东大街国民党特务机关进行调查。美方代表当场指出军调部为外交性机关，应享有免检之权利，和字四号命令已有明文规定，应当将卡车行李交还军调部自行处理，乃遭该特务机关负责人李远仁借口“维持地方治安”，根据“防区”法令，悍然拒绝，至当日调查未获结果。十八日晨，特别小组再度集议，国民党代表竟宣布“政府方面参谋长蒋文治将军，已命令地方当局执行强制检查，故会议已无必要”，几陷谈判于僵局。中共方面则坚持和字四号命令不容破坏，但为表明该方面光明正大态度，自愿将行李打开，邀请小组代表参观，然严正拒绝国民党特务及警宪机关之参与。十九日，执行部三委员举行会议，一致认为该非法机关（即景山东大街国民党特务机关）无权检查执行部行李及卡车，复经特别小组力争，李远仁无理抗拒，遂于当日下午六时将卡车及行李放行，驶回军调部。七时军调部中共方面将被扣行李自行打开，邀特别小组代表参观，均系衣物被服金钱报纸等物，并无任何所谓违禁品在内。于是此时国民党特务机关非法扣检事件，在拖延整整三日之后，宣告结束。"

    "content": "Gaoyang's Textile Industry\n    Chu Yuan\n    The nationally renowned Gaoyang textile industry has revived from its difficulties amidst the wave of peaceful construction by the people of central Hebei. Walking through each village, one hears the clatter of looms. Cloth, thread, and cotton ceaselessly flow from the countryside towards the towns. Large groups of bicycles whiz by from the fields – these are the mobile merchants selling cloth. Even more numerous are the elderly and young women, wearing indigo-dyed Gaoyang cloth, carrying baskets to the market to sell their products. Approaching the suburbs, one sees many large chimneys emitting black smoke. Factory whistles sound constantly, and the roar of motors and machines can be faintly heard from afar. Since leaving Zhangjiakou, we have once again witnessed the unique prosperity of a liberated area city.\n\n    The recovery and development of Gaoyang's textile industry in the six to seven months since liberation has exceeded ten times that of the enemy-occupied period, and the prosperity of the markets has surpassed even that. According to the county Federation of Industry and Commerce, less than one hundred bolts of cloth and three to four hundred jin of thread were traded at each market in Gaoyang city during the enemy occupation. However, by late April, each market traded eight to ten thousand bolts of cloth and over twelve thousand jin of thread. The number of people trading at the large market held every five days was over twenty thousand. Currently, there are more than thirty markets scattered in various townships throughout the county, with five or six markets operating every day. The largest commodity is the wide Gaoyang cloth, actively sold by mobile merchants to various towns and cities in the central Hebei, southern Hebei, western Hebei, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan liberated areas.\n\n    The prosperity of the markets demonstrates the rapid development of rural handicrafts. According to materials from the Farmers' Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, in late April, over seventy percent of the county's 108 villages saw most farmers and women participating extensively in mutual aid groups and cooperatives for spinning, weaving, and selling cloth. They have been universally organized in the integration of agricultural production and textile marketing. Already, twenty thousand women are engaged in spinning, each spinning one jin of thread every five days, producing 120,000 jin of thread per month. The number of looms has doubled from three thousand after liberation to six thousand, and the number of weavers has reached over eighteen thousand. They weave three thousand bolts of \"foreign warp and native weft\" (native thread) wide cloth, eighty feet long, per day, producing ninety thousand bolts per month. Currently, with Gaoyang as the center, extending to Qingyuan, Li County, Renqiu, Anxin, and other neighboring areas, a vast rural textile boom has swept across the area, with every household spinning and every village weaving, forming the largest textile center on the central Hebei plain.\n\n    During the period of Japanese occupation, cotton became a military supply. Of the county's sixty thousand looms, some were destroyed and others were seized, leaving only three thousand. Besides weaving for the \"combination\" in the city, no one in the countryside wove cloth anymore. The people lost their source of wealth and lived the most difficult lives. It wasn't until liberation last year that both people and machines came back to life. To recover the vitality lost in eight years, the village chief of Weijiazhuang Village, fifteen li east of Gaoyang city, told us that his village had sixty machines before the war of resistance. After eight years of Japanese occupation, only two remained. After liberation, three more were added, and this April, the number had increased to nine. Now they are organized to buy twenty more, and they plan to strive to restore the pre-war level by the end of this year.\n\n    Before the war of resistance, Gaoyang's textile industry was once extremely prosperous. During its peak in the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China (1917-1918), it had sixty thousand iron looms and fourteen modern machine dyeing and rolling factories, producing 1.7 million bolts annually, which were sold in Gansu, Suiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, the Northeast, Shanxi, Henan, and major cities in China. Hong Kong, Yangon, and Singapore also saw its presence. However, its development was extremely incomplete. As a result of the enemy's rule, the supply of yarn completely depended on enemy yarn factories in Shanghai and Tianjin. The production of cloth came from farmers' household handicrafts, while the machine production in factories was only the processing part of bleaching, rolling, dyeing, and calendering the finished products. Farmers grew cotton only to produce raw materials for Japanese yarn factories. They had to rely on enemy yarn factories for the thread they used to weave cloth themselves. They engaged in individual, backward manual production in their earthen houses and had actually become the cheapest labor force scattered in the Chinese countryside by Japanese imperialism, sharing the same fate as the workers concentrated in the factories. Industrial capitalists were squeezed and suppressed and could not control the entire production process, only grasping at the tail end and competing for profits from the cloth woven by the farmers. For decades, they had not shaken off their status as economic vassals of Japan. In 1927, with the rise of Japanese rayon, Gaoyang cotton products plummeted, and farmers reorganized over seventy percent of their business to produce hemp and silk products to eke out a living. In 1937-38, with the large-scale dumping of Japanese silk fabrics, Gaoyang's textile industry was once again severely hit, and many large cloth and thread shops closed down. With the fall of Gaoyang city after the war of resistance, it died a complete death.\n\n    However, today, although the Gaoyang textile industry rebuilt by the people themselves is still far from the pre-war level, it has undergone fundamental changes. The shackles of imperialist economic constraints have been completely shattered, and feudal exploitation after rent and interest reduction has also been greatly weakened. The productive forces of farmers have been organized and are developing forward at an unprecedented speed, which is the main reason for the rapid development of handicrafts today. A large number of handcrafted products have poured out of the countryside. They need dyeing and processing, and merchants are needed to promote sales. Because the hand-spun thread cannot keep up with the needs of weaving, they still rely on the import of more than half of the foreign yarn from Tianjin and Beijing. They not only need capital and looms, but also spinning machines, and need technical guidance and improvement. Here, it provides the most favorable political and economic conditions for industrial and commercial capitalists to develop their enterprises.\n\n    We visited the relatively large private Heji Electric Dyeing and Rolling Factory, which was one of the first to start operations after liberation and has therefore profited greatly. Manager Mr. Zhang Xiangting was hired as a county councilor. He described the current business situation, saying: in April, they could dye five hundred bolts and roll three hundred bolts of cloth per market (five days). The charge for dyeing one bolt is three thousand yuan, and the charge for rolling one bolt is three hundred yuan, totaling an income of 1.59 million yuan. After deducting labor, coal, and pigment costs of 600,000 yuan, the net profit is over 980,000 yuan. Manager Zhang announced in January that he wanted to make a profit of six million yuan this year, and the income from the current four months has already completed this plan. Therefore, he said happily: \"Making money is a small matter. I am willing to work together with the democratic government to develop Gaoyang's textile industry.\"\n\n    Here, there is no monopoly of bureaucratic capital to compete with the people for profits. For factories that were severely damaged by the Japanese invaders and unable to resume operations, the democratic government supported them with huge loans. The Jizhong Bank specially allocated 11 million yuan, of which 7 million has been loaned out, to reward private management, but also promoted public-private joint ventures. Hongji Dyeing and Rolling Factory, Yuanfeng Flour Company, Sanyi Electric Light Company, and Tonghe Dyeing and Pressing Factory are all partnerships between private capitalists and the democratic government. Because of the eight years of loss, their vitality was greatly damaged, and private capital was difficult to operate independently. However, the democratic government still aimed to support private development of industry and commerce. Manager Chen of Hongji Dyeing and Rolling Factory cooperated with the Seventh Military Sub-district and was very satisfied with the 20 percent dividend on machinery: \"The public sector is needed to help with the eight years of losses. The public sector is really not working with us to make money, but to develop the people's cause.\"\n\n    Due to the support of the democratic government and the favorable economic conditions in the liberated area, industry and commerce in Gaoyang city are booming. Heji, Enji, Tonghe, and Hongji, the four large dyeing and rolling factories, have already started operations. Yuanfeng's flour mill has produced flour. Sanyi Electric Light Company has installed bright electric lights throughout the city. Fifteen small weaving factories, such as Democratic, Happiness, and Tongju, have sprung up. In April, the number of printing factories increased sharply from one or two to ten. Nine handicraft dyeing shops have resumed operations. Thirty-one shops operating in the cloth business have also opened. Surrounding the development of the textile industry, more than one hundred shops and stalls, workshops of various industries such as daily necessities, food, drink, bicycles, iron shops, and pharmacies, have obtained development opportunities in this emerging city that they have not had in the past eight years.\n\n    However, urban industry and commerce are still not catching up with the development of markets and handicrafts, mainly because they are affected by the Kuomintang's destruction of peaceful transportation and freedom of trade. Merchants buying cloth from Beiping and Tianjin were unreasonably detained and confiscated, and the transportation of cloth on trains was prohibited. Heavy taxes were levied on machinery and foreign yarn imported into our area, and their value was increased without limit, imposing a strict blockade on us. All these measures will actually further drive the people of Beiping and Tianjin, who urgently expect the assistance of materials from the liberated areas, to a more painful and impoverished life. Today, the people of the liberated areas have unanimously risen up and poured into peaceful construction. They have the confidence to overcome the new difficulties given by the reactionaries, and they are determined to persist in the struggle for defending the liberated areas and building the liberated areas until complete victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 高阳的纺织业\n初原\n1946-08-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　高阳的纺织业\n    初原\n    驰名全国的高阳纺织业，在冀中人民和平建设的浪潮中，已从艰难中复兴了。走过每一个村庄，都听到轧轧的织布机声，从四乡通往城镇的路上，布、线、棉花络绎不绝的向集市拥进。大群的自行车从田野里疾驰而过，那是推销布匹的流动商人，更有许许多多年老和年青的妇女，穿着阴丹士林色的高阳布，提着篮子赶集，出卖她们的生产品。一到城郊，就可见到好多大烟囱冒着黑烟，工厂的汽笛，不断叫着，马达和机器的轰鸣声更远远的隐约可闻。从离开张家口以后，我们又一次看到解放区城市及特有的繁荣气象了。\n    高阳纺织业从解放后六、七个月的恢复发展，已超过敌占期间十倍以上，集市的繁荣超过更远，据县工商联合会谈：高阳城内敌占时每集上布不到一百匹，上线三、四百斤，而在四月下旬每集上布已达八千到一万匹，上线一万二千余斤，每五天一大集的交易人数，均在两万以上，目前全县分散在各乡镇共有三十多个集市，每天总有五、六个集。最大宗的物品，就是宽面的高阳布，经过活跃的流动商人推销于冀中、冀南、冀西、张家口、承德、热、察、绥解放区各大小城镇。\n    集市的繁荣，表现了农村手工业的飞速发展，根据农会与工商联合会的材料，全县一○八个村庄中，在四月下旬已有百分之七十以上的村庄，大部分的农民与妇女都普遍的参加了纺线、织布和卖布的互助组与合作社。在农业生产与纺织运销结合中已普遍的组织起来了，已有两万妇女投入纺织，每人五天纺出一斤线，一月出线十二万斤。织布机解放后三千张，现已六千张，剧增一倍，织布人数已到一万八千以上，每天织成“经洋纬柴”（柴即土线）八十尺长的宽面布三千匹，月产九万匹。目前以高阳为中心，推及清苑，蠡县、任邱、安新等邻边地区，广大农村已卷入纺织热潮中，家家纺线，村村织布，形成了冀中平原上规模最大的纺织中心。\n    日寇统治时期，棉花成了军用品，全县六万张织布机毁的毁抢的抢，只剩下三千张了，除了城内替“组合”织布外，乡村里再没人织布了，人民失掉了富源，过着最苦的日子，直到去年解放以后人和机子都复活起来，要恢复八年损失的元气，高阳城东十五里魏家庄村长告诉我们说：抗战前他村里有六十张机子，鬼子占了八年只剩下两张了，解放后增加了三张，今年四月已增至九张，现在又组织起来买二十张，计划今年底争取恢复战前水平。\n    抗战前高阳纺织业曾盛极一时，民国六、七年鼎盛时代，拥有铁机六万张，近代机器染轧工厂十四家，年产一百七十万匹，畅销于甘肃、绥远、张家口、外蒙、新疆、东北、山西、河南及国内各大城市；香港、仰光、新嘉坡亦有其踪迹。但是，它的发展，是异常残缺不全的，敌寇统治的结果，线纱的供给，完全依赖于沪、津敌人纱厂，布的生产则出于农民家庭手工业，而工厂的机器生产，仅是织成品的漂白、轧宽、染色、轧光等加工部分；农民种植棉花，只是为了东洋纱厂生产原料，自己织布用线，反求敌人纱厂供给，他们坐在土屋里进行个人落后的手工生产，实际上已变成日本帝国主义分散在中国农村中最廉价的劳动力，和集中在工厂里的工人是同样命运的。工业资本家们受到排挤和打击，不能掌握全部生产过程，只是抓住了一条尾巴，从农民织成的布匹上争求利润，数十年来他们没有摆脱掉日寇经济上的附庸地位，民国十六年，日本人造丝兴起，高阳棉品一落千丈，农民遂改组百分之七十以上的麻丝品，以苟延挣扎，民国二十六、七年日寇丝织品大倾销，高阳纺织业又一次被惨重打击，许多大布线庄纷纷倒闭，抗战后随着高阳城的陷落，也就一命鸣呼了。\n    可是今天为人民亲手重建的高阳纺织业虽离战前水平相距尚远，但在根本上已起了新的变化，帝国主义经济束缚的枷锁，已被彻底粉碎，减租减息后封建剥削也大大剥弱，农民生产力已组织起来，并以空前未有的速度向前发展，这就是目前手工业飞速发展的主要原因。大量的手工生产品从农村中涌出来了，它们需要染色加工，需要商人推销，因为手工纺线赶不上织布的需要，仍依赖平、津输入一半以上的洋纱，他们不但需要资本和织布机，更需要纺纱机，需要技术上指导和改进，在这里，它给工商业资本家准备下了发展企业最有利的政治和经济条件。\n    我们参观此间规模较大的私营合记电力染轧工厂，它是解放后开工最早的一个，因此获利很大，经理张香亭先生被聘为县议员，他述及目前营业情况说：四月份每集（五天）已能染五百匹，轧三百匹布，染一匹收费三千元，轧一匹三百元。共收入一百五十九万元，除了人力、煤、颜料成本消耗六十万元外，可获净利九十八万余元，张经理在一月份曾宣布今年要求获利六百万元，仅目前四个月的收入，已经完成这个计划了。因此他很高兴的说：“挣钱还是小事，愿与民主政府共同努力，发展高阳纺织业”。\n    这里没有官僚资本的垄断，来与民争利，对于被日寇破坏很重无力复业的工厂，民主政府以巨大贷款扶植之，冀中银行特拨一千一百万元，现已贷下七百万，奖励私人经营，但也提倡公私合营。鸿记染轧工厂，元丰面粉公司，三益电灯公司，同合染压工厂均系私人资本家与民主政府合作，因为八年的损失，元气大伤，私人资本很难独力经营，但是民主政府仍以扶植私人发展工商业为目的。鸿记染轧工厂陈经理与七分区合作，他对机器分红百分之二十很觉满意：“八年的损失，需要公家帮助，公家真不是为赚钱而是为发展人民事业来和我们合作的。”\n    由于民主政府的扶植与解放区有利的经济条件，高阳城内工商业日益蓬勃发展，合记、恩记、同合、鸿记四家大的染轧工厂已经开工了，元丰的火磨已出产面粉，三益电灯公司为全城按上明亮的电灯，民主、幸福、同聚等小型织布工厂兴起了十五家，四月内印花厂从一、两家剧增至十家，有九家手工业染房复业了，三十一家经营布业的店也开张了，围绕着纺织业的发达，从日用品吃、喝、自行车、铁铺、药房一百余家的各业店铺摊贩，作坊都在这新兴的城市里获得了八年来未有的发展机会。\n    但是，城市工商业仍赶不上集市与手工业的发展，主要原因是受了国民党破坏和平交通与贸易自由的影响，从北平、天津出来买布的商人，被无理的扣押没收，火车上禁止贩运布匹，对输入我区的机器与洋线，抽以重税，无限制提高价值，对我实行严格的封锁，这一切措施，实际上将更驱使迫切期待解放区物资援助的平津人民走向更加痛苦和贫困的生活。今天解放区人民已一致奋起涌入和平建设，他们有信心克服反动派所给予的新困难，他们已决心为着保卫解放区与建设解放区坚持斗争到彻底胜利。"

    "content": "Snippets of Shanghai Women Workers' Activities\n\nNearly 200,000 women workers in Shanghai play an extremely important role in the labor movement. In industrial trade unions with women workers, women workers serve as members of the council and supervisors. Taking the trade unions in the three districts as an example, women workers account for seven-tenths of the council and supervisors in the textile industry trade union, one-fifth in the dyeing and weaving industry trade union, one-sixth in the wool textile industry trade union, and one-tenth in the silk weaving industry trade union. Due to the increasing awareness and activities of women workers, outstanding women worker leaders have emerged in the trade unions. For example, in the Hudong District, the well-known ones include Lu Jingfen, Chairperson of the Trade Union of Shenxin Factory No. 6; Gu Lianying, Chairperson of the Trade Union of Weitong Yarn Factory (automatically elected as a National Assembly representative by Shanghai women); Tang Shiying (National Assembly representative), Standing Committee Member of the Trade Union of China Textile Factory No. 14; Xu Weifang (National Assembly representative), Standing Committee Member of the Trade Union of Yizhong Factory No. 3; He Xiufeng, Standing Committee Member of the Trade Union of Dakang Yarn Factory; Fan Cuiyun, Council Member of the Shenxin Trade Union; and Xu Xujun, Council Member of the Armed Pharmaceutical Factory Trade Union. In addition, Pan Yueying, a woman worker from Huxi who was elected as a National Assembly representative with the second-highest number of votes, and Tang Guifen (a woman worker from a yarn factory), also a National Assembly representative, are also famous women worker leaders in Shanghai. Their work in the trade unions often surpasses that of male workers, earning the support and love of the majority of workers.\n\nIn order to improve their cultural level, they squeeze time out of their heavy housework of washing clothes, cooking, and taking care of children, and from their sleep time, to attend night schools and literacy classes after twelve or thirteen hours of work every day. For example, in Shenxin Factory No. 9 and Shen Erzhong Factory…the majority or all of the students in the night schools are women workers. Many female employees serve as their teachers. Women workers from chemical and pharmaceutical factories with higher cultural levels, and female telephone operators from telephone companies, actively participate in cultural activities such as dramas, singing, and wall newspapers. The women workers also raised funds through \"flower selling\" and other means to establish maternity clinics, organize nurseries, and build civilian obstetrical hospitals. This spring, under the unified action of the \"Lianyi Association,\" they resolutely elected their own National Assembly representatives (a total of five women workers were elected, as mentioned earlier) and bravely participated in the recent 100,000-person anti-civil war parade. In an undemocratic tradition and a discriminatory environment against women, and in the face of insults and enticements from labor scabs and secret agents, they still strive to continuously raise their awareness, unite their strength, and fight together with male workers and the people of the whole country for China's peace and democracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海女工活动片断\n\n1946-08-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海女工活动片断\n    上海将近二十万的女工，在工运中起着极重要的作用。在有女工的产业工会中，都有女工担任理监事，以三区各工会来说，纺织业产业工会理监事女工占十分之七，染织业工会占五分之一，毛织业工会占六分之一，丝织业工会占十分之一。由于女工觉悟的提高和活动的增加，在工会中产生了出色的女工领袖，如在沪东区著名的有申新六厂工会理事长陆静芬，纬通纱厂工会理事长顾莲英（上海妇女界自动选出的国大代表），中纺十四厂工会常务理事汤世英（国大代表）颐中三厂工会常务理事徐伟芳（国大代表），大康纱厂工会常务理事何秀凤，申新工会理事范翠云及武装药厂工会理事徐蓄君等，此外以第二位最多票数当选国大代表的沪西女工潘月英，国大代表汤桂芬（纱厂女工）等，也都是上海的著名女工领袖，她们在工会工作，成绩往往超过男工，得到广大工友的拥护和爱戴。\n    为了提高文化，她们每天在十二三小时的工作之外，从洗衣烧饭带孩子的繁重家务和睡眠时间里，挤出时间进夜校识字班，如申新九厂和申二中厂……夜校，求学的大部或全部是女工。许多女职员担任他们的教员，文化较高的化学厂药厂的女工和电话公司的女接线生，都积极参加戏剧歌咏壁报等文化活动。女工们并以“卖花”等款创办产妇诊疗所，筹办托儿所，和平民产科医院。今年春天在“联谊会”的统一行动下，毅然选出了自己的国大代表（女工共选出五名见前），和勇敢地参加最近一次的十万人反内战大游行。她们在不民主的传统和歧视女性的环境下，在工贼特务的侮辱和利诱的困难条件中，仍努力不断的提高觉悟，团结力量，与男工及全国人民一起为中国的和平民主而奋斗。"

In the newly liberated Xidaiwang Village, the total amount of burden is 152,200 jin less than the amount of grain requisitioned by the stubborn puppet army last year. Moreover, because the village administration has been reformed, the assessment and distribution are fair and serious. The masses are very satisfied and paid all of it on the 17th and 18th of this month. The general reaction is: \"It's not even as much as the temporary meals that the Central Team used to dispatch in the village!\" The rich peasant Cheng Huirong said: \"My family paid seventeen dan last year, but only one dan and three dou this year; the Eighth Route Army worked hard to protect us in harvesting wheat, and I am willing to support another dan!\" Middle peasant Fan Chenggong also automatically paid fifty jin more, his reason being \"to let our Eighth Route Army eat their fill and beat the bad troops attacking the liberated areas far away!\" Everyone feels that since the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, the common people have enjoyed happiness, so the wheat is delivered quickly and well. When the leadership called on them to oppose the civil war, the masses said: \"Whoever wants to fight a civil war will be eliminated!\" \"With strong soldiers and sufficient grain, we will surely be victorious!\"\n    [Another dispatch] Xiatun in the Second District of Anyang completed it very quickly. In Lijia Village in the district, the grain was all delivered in just two days. A folk song is circulating in the village saying: \"The public grain is light, and the assessment is fair and serious. We have all been liberated, and paying a little public grain expresses our gratitude!\"\n    [Changzhi, 28th dispatch] Zhang Taixiao, a labor hero from Sanjiaohe Village, Xiyang, has actively helped the masses become prosperous in this year's great production movement, and is even more loved by the masses in the village. The labor exchange team led by Zhang Taixiao is united and consolidated, and is a model labor exchange team in the county. Every farmer who participates can recognize the benefits of organizing mutual assistance and actively engages in production. The labor exchange team has become everyone's reliance. The team has forty-four households and one hundred and eighty-two people. Before planting this spring, Zhang Taixiao led everyone to cut trees on the mountain for three days and transported them to Nanzuo Town, Yuanshi, to exchange for 2,000 jin of salt, which solved the problem of salt consumption for the whole team this year. Over the past two years, most of the team has become prosperous. There are only six poor households left in the team. Zhang Taixiao immediately mobilized the whole team to help them become prosperous, ensuring that they will all completely rise to the level of middle peasants this year. They reclaimed five mu of wasteland for Zheng Cungui, and helped Sui Chengxi cut and transport mountain goods together, earning 5,000 yuan to buy eight mu of hillside land. Zhang Taixiao also lent out 6,000 yuan earned from selling cattle this spring to help the remaining households buy land, and also helped them raise pigs. The masses in the village said: \"We were liberated thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, but Zhang Taixiao is the one who directly led us to liberation.\"\n   (Xin Ying)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人人高兴抢缴公粮  修武新区民负大减  张太小拨工队成绩好\n新颖\n1946-08-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　人人高兴抢缴公粮\n    修武新区民负大减\n    张太小拨工队成绩好\n    【本报长治讯】修武县今年夏季人民负担大大减轻。新解放的西待王村，全部负担数目比去年顽伪军统治时的派粮一项还少十五万二千二百斤，且因村政得到改革，评议分派都很公道认真。群众非常满意，在本月十七、十八两日内就全部交齐了。一般的反映是：“还没有中央队到村上临时派饭吃的多哩！”富农程会荣老汉说：“我家去年出十七石，今年才一石三；八路军辛辛苦苦保卫咱收麦，我情愿多拥护一石！”中农范承功也自动多交五十斤，他的理由是“叫咱八路军吃得饱饱的，把进攻解放区的坏军队打得远远的！”大家都觉得共产党、八路军来了以后，老百姓享了福，所以交的麦子又快又好。当领导上号召反内战时，群众说：“谁要打内战就把他消灭！”“兵又强，粮又足，一定能够胜利！”\n    【又讯】安阳二区夏屯完成得很快。该区李家岗，只两天就交齐了。村里流传着一只歌谣说：“公粮公粮轻，评议又公又认真。咱们大家翻了身，交点公粮表表心！”\n    【长治二十八日电】昔阳三教河村劳动英雄张太小，在今年大生产运动中，积极帮助群众发家，更为该村群众所爱戴。张太小所领导的拨工大队，团结巩固，是该县的模范拨工队，参加的每一农户均能认识组织互助的好处，积极生产。拨工队成为大家的依靠。该队四十四户，一百八十二人，今春下种前，张太小领导大家每人上山砍树把三天，运往元氏南佐镇即换回食盐二千斤，解决了全队今年吃盐的问题。两年来该队大部生产发家，全队仅余六户贫农，张太小今年即发动全队帮助他们发家，保证在今年内使他们完全上升为中农。他们为郑存贵开荒五亩，为眭成喜互助砍山货，运输赚洋五千元买坡地八亩，张太小并将今春贩牛所赚六千元借出为其余几户买地，另外还帮助他们养猪。该村群众说：“咱们翻身是有了共产党和毛主席，但直接领导咱翻身的是张太小。”\n   （新颖）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 2nd. The industry and commerce of the Huaihai area in the Suwan Border Region has developed greatly in recent years, which is due to the democratic government's excellent industrial and commercial policies and the rapid recovery and prosperity of the rural economy. In the past winter and spring, the Huaihai Prefectural Commissioner's Office successively issued huge amounts of agricultural loans, including various loans such as plowing cattle, fertilizers, and green seedlings, totaling 9.3 million Central China currency (nearly 300 million legal tender), and 500,000 jin of grain, benefiting 17,000 people. In addition, a separate allocation of 10,000 yuan and 300 jin of cotton was provided to support the rural household textile industry throughout the region. \"Cotton Shop Cloth Exchange Stations\" were widely established to exchange cloth, so that private textile funds could circulate and new difficulties in textiles could be overcome more quickly. It was also clearly stipulated that all troops and agencies in the region must purchase local cloth to solve the problem of local cloth sales. The textile industry in the region has developed from 103,077 spinning wheels and 1,066 looms last winter to 163,210 spinning wheels and 144,500 looms at present. The development of Huainan Town in Puyang City, which was newly liberated, is the fastest. The town had 40 looms last year, and now has 117, an increase of three times. In terms of industry and commerce, the First Branch of the Central China Bank issued industrial loans of 20 million yuan (the same below for 600 million legal tender), commercial credit loans of more than 1 million yuan, commercial wholesale loans of more than 1.3 million yuan, and small loans of 300,000 yuan. This spring, the Sixth Prefectural Commissioner's Office also clearly ordered the loan bureau to postpone the collection of spring and summer production and sales taxes. At present, there are more than 1,000 public and private factories in the region, including textiles, cigarettes, cotton ginning, leather, papermaking, and soap industries, with a total capital of 2.63 million yuan, of which private capital accounts for three-fifths. Now public factories have turned to public-private joint ventures to fully absorb private capital and develop private capital. The state-owned \"Hua Xin Tobacco Company\" has also begun to increase capital to raise shares to expand its capital to 30 million yuan, and has purchased cigarette machines and installed motors in large quantities, which will become the first machine factory in the region. In terms of operation, state-owned stores focus on taking care of and supporting small businesses. During the spring famine this year, state-run stores in various places wholesaled 2 million square feet of local cloth, 50,000 taels of silkworm cocoons, and a large number of Huaizi, mats, etc. to small and medium-sized merchants, which greatly benefited them. For example, cloth merchant Zhao Zihe only had capital of two bolts of cloth, but after obtaining loans and support from state-owned stores, his capital has expanded tenfold. Now Shuyang City produces more than 2,000 square feet of local cloth every day, which is not enough for sales in the city. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office is allocating 80 million yuan in Mucheng and collecting private shares to establish a local product consignment office and the \"Yimin Cooperative\" to further develop the local product business in the region.\n\n(This newspaper Changzhi dispatch) The implementation of \"labor-capital cooperation\" in the city's Huaqiang Textile Factory has increased the productivity of workers by more than one time. The factory has been operated by the agency since March 20th. Before and after April 20th, due to the withdrawal of some funds by the agency, wages were not stipulated, and the business policy was not clear, which caused the productivity of workers to decline. On May 10, the factory held a meeting to review and determined that the factory would implement \"labor-capital cooperation\" in the future. The public contributes capital, the workers contribute labor, and the labor-capital profit-sharing method is implemented. The workers manage the factory themselves. Since then, the workers have established a sense of ownership, and their lives have gradually improved. The production mood and quality have doubled compared with the past. In the past, three or four workers weaved a bolt of cloth, and in May, each worker weaved one bolt (28 feet). On June 10, when the factory summarized the production achievements in January, 12 workers and 3 machines weaved a total of 71 bolts of cloth, earning 500 yuan per bolt, for a total of 35,500 yuan. After deducting food and miscellaneous expenses, the net remaining profit was 20,000 yuan. According to the \"capital 2, labor 8 profit sharing\", the workers benefited 16,000 yuan. In order to help the factory develop rapidly, the government specially loaned 30,000 yuan. Under this rising production mood, a one-month production plan from June 10 to July 10 was drawn up, and it is estimated that a net surplus of 44,000 yuan can be obtained after deducting food and miscellaneous expenses, and the workers' income will be doubled by a 3-7 profit sharing (capital 3, labor 7).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 公私合营开展工商建设  淮海区纺织日渐发达  长治华强纺织厂产率提高\n\n1946-08-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　公私合营开展工商建设\n    淮海区纺织日渐发达\n    长治华强纺织厂产率提高\n    【新华社淮阴二日电】苏皖边区淮海地区工商业数年来有很大发展，这是由于民主政府优良的工商政策及农村经济的迅速恢复与繁荣的结果。去冬今春两季淮海专署曾先后发放巨大数字的农业贷款，计有耕牛、肥料、青苗等各种贷款华中币九百三十万元（合法币近三万万元），粮食五十万斤，受益者一万七千人。并另拨款一万元，棉花三百斤，扶助全区农村家庭纺织业。普遍建立“花店布交换所”换布，使民间纺织资金周转，加速克服纺织新的困难。并明令规定全区部队机关一律采购土布，以解决土布销路问题。全区纺织业自去年冬一○三、○七七架纺车，一、○六六架织布机发展到目前一六三、二一○架纺车，一四四、五○○架织布机，尤以新解放的濮阳城之淮南镇发展最速，该地去年织机四十架，现已有一百一十七架，增加三倍。工商业方面，华中银行第一分行在全区发放工业贷款二千万元（合法币六万万元以下同此），商业信用贷款一百余万元，商业批采贷款一百三十余万元，小本贷款三十万元。今春六专署并明令贷款局缓征春夏季产销税收。现全区有公私营工厂千余家，包括纺织、香烟、弹花、皮革、造纸、肥皂等业，资金共二百六十三万元，其中私资占五分之三。现公营工厂已转向公私合营方式，充分吸收民资，发展私人资本。公营“华新烟草公司”，亦开始增资招股扩大资金到三千万元，并添购卷烟机大量装置马达，将成为全区第一家机器工厂。公营商店在经营的方式上，以照顾扶助小商人为主。在今年春荒期中，各地工营商店将收购的土布二百万方尺，蚕茧丝五万两，及大量华子、席子等，批发给中小商人，使中小商人获益甚大。如布商赵子和只有两匹布资本，自获得贷款及公营商店扶植后，资金已扩大十倍。现沭阳城一地日产土布二千余方丈，在本市销售尚嫌不够，专署正在沐城拨款八千万元并收集私股创办土产代销所与“益民合作社”，以进一步发展全区土产事业。\n    【本报长治讯】本市华强纺织厂实行“劳资合营”，工人生产率飞速提高一倍余，该厂自三月廿日开始由机关经营。四月廿日前后，由于机关抽走部份资金，工资又未规定，营业方针也不明确，致使工人生产率降低。五月十日，全厂开会检讨，确定今后工厂“劳资合营”，公家入资本，工人入劳力，实行劳资分红办法，由工人自己管理工厂，从此，工人树立了主人翁思想，生活也渐渐改善，生产情绪和质量比过去提高一倍。过去三四个工织一匹布，五月每工就织一匹（市尺二丈八尺）。六月十日该厂总结一月生产成绩时，十二个工人，三架机子，共织布七十一匹，每匹布赚洋五百元，共计赚洋三万五千五百元，除伙食杂支消费外，净余红利二万元，按“资二劳八分红”，工人得利一万六千元。政府为帮助工厂迅速发展，特贷款三万元。在这高涨的生产情绪下，又订出六月十日至七月十日一月生产计划，预计除伙食杂支消费可净余四万四千元，以三七分红（资三劳七），工人收入较前增加一倍。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd - The weaving industry is extremely prosperous in the cotton-producing areas of western Hebei. According to incomplete statistics, the number of wooden and iron looms in Tangxian, Quyang, Wangdu, Yixian, and Dingxian counties has increased to more than 16,000. During the slack farming seasons of spring and winter, it can produce more than 576,000 bolts of cloth. Even during the busy farming season, a large number of rural women are engaged in textile work. The development of the textile industry has gradually eliminated the disparity between the prices of industrial and agricultural products, stimulated a sharp increase in agricultural production funds, and farmers have purchased land to expand production. This has stimulated higher land prices. For example, in the Daxihe Village, a prosperous weaving area, the price of land per mu has risen to more than 60,000 yuan this spring, while in the neighboring Zhuanlu Village, which is not a cloth-producing area, it is only more than 20,000 yuan per mu. In Hongzhen, the center of the Quyang textile industry, the price of land per mu is as high as 20,000 yuan, while in the adjacent Daqiqiu it is only more than 12,000 yuan.\n　　\nXinhua News Agency, Hejian, 2nd - In Shizhuang Township, in the liberated area east of Dingxian city on the Pinghan Railway, all young and middle-aged women have participated in textile production. There is almost one loom per household and one spinning wheel per person. A reporter recently passed through the town and conducted a survey of three alleys. There were a total of 51 households with 49 looms and 108 spinning wheels, with more than 100 women engaged in spinning and weaving. In several farm households visited, many of the heads of the household were young women. A young woman named Meishu told reporters: \"If women wait for men to bring food like in the old society, then they shouldn't even think about truly raising their status. But like us today, able to spin, weave, and work in the fields, men not only don't look down on us, but they also have to respect us!\" Her income from weaving cloth in the spring was more than 20,000 yuan and more than ten bags of grain, which is equal to half of her husband's annual agricultural production income. Jin Guihe, the head of another happy farming family, and his wife and three children all wore new socks and trousers made of fine white cloth. Jin Guihe said that the reason for the rise in his family's economy was largely due to his wife's hard work in textile production. Last year, the family's cotton clothing, rations, and this summer's single clothing were all earned from textile work, and they also bought some new farm tools. Many of the local government and cooperative staff are now women.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀西棉区一片机杼声  纺织业刺激地价高涨  市庄镇纺织改变家庭妇女地位\n\n1946-08-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀西棉区一片机杼声\n    纺织业刺激地价高涨         \n    市庄镇纺织改变家庭妇女地位\n    【新华社张家口二日电】河北西部产棉区织布业极盛。据不完全统计：唐县、曲阳、望都、易县、定县六县铁木布机，现已增至一万六千余张，春冬两季农闲可产布五十七万六千余匹，即是农忙季节亦有大批农妇专事纺织。由于纺织业发达，使工农业产品价格之悬殊形势逐渐消除，促使农业生产资金剧增，农民纷纷购置土地扩大生产。因此，刺激地价提高，如织布繁盛区大西河村，今春每亩地价已涨至六万余元，而邻近非产布区砖路村每亩只二万余元。曲阳纺织业中心洪镇每亩地价达二万余元，相接壤的大起邱只有一万二千余元。\n    【新华社河间二日电】平汉路定县城东解放区的市庄镇，青壮年妇女已全部参加纺织，几达每户一张织机，每人一辆纺车。记者日前路经该镇进行了三条胡同的调查，共计有五十一家有织机四十九张，纺车一百零八辆，纺织妇女达百余人。在所访问的几家农户中，发现不少当家者均为青年妇女。一个名梅树的青年妇女告诉记者：“妇女们要是像在旧社会等着男人拿吃的来，那就不要想真正提高自己的地位，可是像我们今天，能纺、能织、能下地，那男人们不用说轻视，还得敬着点呢！”她春季织布已收入二万多元和十来口袋粮食，等于她丈夫全年农业生产收入的一半。另一家美满的农民家庭主人金贵和，及他老婆三个孩子，都穿着白细布的新袜裤，金贵和说：他家经济上升的原因，大半均得力于他媳妇的辛勤纺织，去年全家的棉衣、口粮和今夏的单衣，都是靠纺织赚来的，另外还置了一些新农具。该地政民干部合作社人员，很多已由妇女担任起来。"

In Guangzong's Fifth District, the villages of Hegu and Jiudian, among others, are actively engaged in production. According to reports, they have already leached 7,718 catties of salt, stored 320 carts of salt-rich soil, stored 191 loads of salt water, and added 10 new salt ponds. Women have earned 29,800 yuan from spinning and weaving. Recent rains have been thorough in each village, and they are actively rushing to plant red millet, rapeseed, yams, and radishes, as well as intensifying soil turning and hoeing the seedlings four times. Xinhe County held a meeting to discuss thrift and dispatched cadres to the countryside to help the masses make household plans. They called for collecting tree leaves and wild vegetables, adding more melons, fruits, beans, and the like to meals, and put forward thrift slogans such as \"eat one less handful of rice a day,\" \"a small stream flows steadily,\" and \"go home for meals after going to the market.\" Each village also held \"thinking meetings\" to recall the famine of 1943. On the part of government cadres, they called for collecting firewood to save fuel, adding vegetables to meals, saving one or two taels of rice per day, not smoking cigarettes, and not eating in restaurants. Government organs have stipulated a system of storing bran and husks when milling rice and flour, and launched a signature campaign for cadres to save.\n    [Report from this newspaper in Weixian] Due to continuous rains, the Wei River surged, and on the 26th, it suddenly breached the dike at Lizhuang, east of Linqing City, and the floodwaters flowed directly into Xiajin, threatening Wu cheng, Enxian, Pingyuan and Laoling with inundation.

The entire national economy faces a total collapse. Merchants in the liberated areas, recognizing this situation, have launched a movement to advocate the use of local goods for self-reliance. In Wu'an city, 24 streets, and across more than 2,700 large and small businesses and vendors in the eight major towns and villages of the county, as well as citizens in the city, are launching a patriotic campaign to buy and sell domestic goods with high patriotic enthusiasm. Under the leadership of the Commercial Association, merchants gathered to discuss how to purify the market, strengthen the exchange of various products from the liberated areas, and restrict the import of foreign goods. They unanimously resolved to establish a Foreign Goods Registration Committee to register existing foreign goods on the market and set a deadline for their sale. Any unsold goods after August 15th will be centrally sold. In the future, they guarantee they will never smuggle in prohibited foreign goods. The government sympathizes with the patriotic enthusiasm of the merchants and firmly supports and approves it, guaranteeing to provide merchants with various conveniences to increase their profits. Currently, shops are enthusiastically registering. On July 29th and 30th alone, more than 340 businesses, including silk shops, porcelain shops, foreign cloth shops, and various cosmetics shops, registered. Many shops are planning to change their business. The silk shop on Nanguan Street will be reorganized into a small textile factory, purchasing various cotton gins, spinning machines, weaving machines, and sock knitting machines. Other foreign porcelain shops will switch to selling local porcelain, and luxury goods shops will switch to selling daily necessities and agricultural tools made of iron that are needed by the masses. This patriotic movement has now spread to major towns and villages such as Yangyi, Hecun, Jicheng, and Paihuai. Wu'an women, who used to be very particular about clothing, are now mostly wearing homespun cloth and not using cosmetics. The People's Education Center is also putting up blackboards on various streets and calling on the people of the city to oppose the dumping of American goods and use domestic goods on the radio. (Yi Fan)\n    [Our Newspaper Reports] The Kuomintang reactionaries are plotting to disrupt our area's finances and undermine the credibility of the Hebei currency. Recently, they have printed a large number of counterfeit notes and dispatched special agents to infiltrate the markets in various parts of northern Henan. A large number of counterfeit notes printed by the puppet Wang Ziquan in Anyang have now been discovered, including five types: green-backed 1,000-yuan notes, 500-yuan notes, blue-backed 500-yuan notes, vertical 500-yuan notes, and Pingyuan blue-backed 500-yuan notes. The Third Branch of the Jinnan Bank has urgently instructed county branches to immediately organize a mass anti-counterfeit currency campaign. The Wu'an County Branch has specifically convened the Commercial Association to study how to identify counterfeit notes and will distribute notices, propaganda materials, and identification methods to various places. The county government plans to issue instructions to the militia in each district to strictly investigate special agents and unscrupulous merchants who carry counterfeit currency into our liberated areas, calling on the masses to defend the Hebei currency and formulate reward measures for catching them.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-05",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd. Shanghai dispatch: Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching Ling, issued a statement on July 22nd regarding her proposals for the current situation. The original text is as follows:\n\n　　In recent years, I have been fully dedicated to wartime relief work, strengthening China's resistance against Japan. I have avoided political disputes to prevent hindering this work. I preferred to remain silent, so that the whole country could focus on winning the war.\n\n　　Now, there is no foreign enemy threatening our territory. We only have internal threats. We are suffering from internal threats. Reactionaries hope to involve the United States, thereby dragging the entire world into war. This civil war, though undeclared, has actually begun.\n\n　　This disaster must be stopped from the beginning. Everyone with human feelings should speak out. Although I still wish to devote all my efforts to relief work, and I do not want my work to be hindered in any way, I feel that I must speak at this time.\n\n　　The current crisis is not a question of who wins or loses between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. It is a question of the Chinese people and their unity, liberation, and survival. This cannot be resolved by maintaining the balance of military power or bargaining over a city or a piece of land. What should be weighed is not the rights of the parties, but the rights of the people.\n\n　　The people are anxiously hoping that the continuous negotiations will yield some results, but whenever a ceasefire agreement is barely reached, a new conflict immediately arises. Negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot make the final decision. The final decision must belong to the Chinese people. The solution, even if difficult, is very clear: that is, a correct understanding of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People—nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood—and their correct implementation today.\n\n　　The meaning of nationalism today is that China does not belong to the Kuomintang, nor does it belong to the Communist Party. China is a country, a nation, but within this country, there are many political opinions. We must have a government that encompasses all the various opinions contributed by all the people.\n\n　　The meaning of democracy today is that the Kuomintang's period of political tutelage has passed, and the constitutional era must begin. Our people have endured hardships to reach this stage, and they have proven that they should have the right to self-government.\n\n　　A coalition government must be established immediately. The formation of this coalition government must not be solely based on the Kuomintang appointing candidates. All parties must elect their own representatives. The Kuomintang's representatives must also be elected by party members, and not appointed by a ruling clique from above. There are many factions within the Kuomintang, and progressive party members have never had the opportunity to speak. Now is the time to practice democracy and establish democracy.\n\n　　Representatives elected in a democratic manner can then proceed to formulate a constitution, which will be recognized and approved by the people. The representatives must write into the constitution the essential basic freedoms that the Chinese people should have, not leaving them to the whims of a few who try to control them, but entrusting them entirely to the people themselves.\n\n　　The meaning of people's livelihood today is that the people can no longer suffer from hunger, while corrupt officials accumulate wealth and honest officials have no way to voice their grievances. The land problem must be resolved reasonably. This is not incited by the Communist Party or external forces; it is the inevitable result of our own historical development. A hundred years ago, the peasants' disturbances led to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising. The people have the right to rise up against feudalism and colonialism, which is an undeniable fact; today, the people have this right, and it cannot be denied.\n\n　　\"Land to the tiller\" is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition, which was adopted by the Kuomintang's First National Congress. This is the basic solution to China's famine. Did not the head of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration recently say that there is no famine in the Communist areas? Why? Because they followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan and distributed the land to the tillers. Such consideration for the people's livelihood should be considered in all regions of the country.\n\n　　The Kuomintang must fulfill its historical mission, leading the people to a complete solution through a coalition government, democratic politics, and land reform. If this mission can be accomplished, the Kuomintang will undoubtedly be the leading party in any coalition government, and it will be supported by many people belonging to other parties, including those parties that have no military force and therefore no power to speak in negotiations. We must let freedom replace corruption, tyranny, terror, suppression, and political assassinations. Unless the Kuomintang immediately completes these tasks, it should bear the responsibility for causing the civil war.\n\n　　Civil war cannot bring us unity, liberation, and stability of the people's livelihood. Civil war brings chaos, hunger, and destruction to the Chinese people.\n\n　　We will see cities and peasants isolated. Peasants will support the Communist Party, which gives them land and reduces taxes. In that case, how will the Kuomintang's cities get raw materials, exports, and even food? Bayonets cannot be used for harvesting. The inflation that has already swallowed many cities will be a hundred times more terrible than it is today. The Kuomintang cannot win in such a war. These are well-known facts. Then, why do the reactionaries want to launch a war that they cannot win? Because they hope that China's internal strife will cause a war between the United States and the Soviet Union, thereby ultimately destroying the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n　　The American people are the Chinese people's allies and long-time friends. They must know the truth about this road to disaster. They must know the fact that the American reactionaries and the Chinese reactionaries are colluding and encouraging each other. They must know that the presence of American troops on Chinese soil cannot promote peace and order among the Chinese people. They must be warned that loans should only be given to a reorganized and truly representative Chinese government. They must know that if the United States can frankly state that it will no longer supply military supplies and military assistance, the Chinese civil war will not expand and develop.\n\n　　Today, the first spark of world war is burning on our land again! It must be extinguished, otherwise the flames will destroy the whole world! I call on the leaders of the two major parties, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as the leaders of other parties and factions in China, to immediately form a coalition government. I call on our American friends to facilitate this action by stopping all arms supplies and only allowing aid to be given to a government belonging to the Chinese people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孙夫人对目前时局主张\n\n1946-08-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孙夫人对目前时局主张\n    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：孙夫人宋庆龄女士于七月二十二日发表对目前时局主张，其原文如下：\n    近年来我完全致力于战时救济工作外，增强中国的抗战力量，我避开政治的论争。以免妨碍这项工作，我宁守缄默，使全国能集中注意以赢取战争的胜利。\n    现在没有外敌在威胁我们的国土了，我们有的只是内部的威胁，我们正受着内部的威胁，反动者希望把美国卷入，从而把全世界拖入战争中。这一内战虽未经宣布，而实际上已开始。\n    这一灾难，必须从头就加以制止，每一具有人类感情的人，应当说话了，虽然我仍愿以全力从事救济工作，并且我不愿我的工作受到任何阻碍，然而，我觉得这时候非说话不可了。\n    目前的危机不是在国共之间谁胜谁败的问题，这是中国人民以及他们的团结解放和生存的问题，这不能从保持军事力量的对比或者在一城一地的讨价还价上求取解决的，应该权衡的不是党派的权利，而是人民的权利。\n    人民对于不断继续的谈判，焦切盼望其能有若干结果，但每当一个停战协议勉强达成以后，新的冲突即随之而起。国共之间的谈判不能作最后之决定，最后决定必须属于中国的人民。解决的方案纵使困难，却非常明白，那就是对于中山先生的三民主义——民族、民权、民生——加以正确的了解，及其在今日的正确实施。\n    民族主义在今日的意义，是指中国不属于国民党，也不属于共产党，中国是一个国家一个民族，但在这个国家内有许多政治的意见，我们必须有一个政府包容全部人民所贡献的各种意见。\n    民权主义在今日的意义，是指国民党的训政时期已经过去了，宪政时期必须开始，我国人民含辛茹苦才达到这一阶段，他们已证明应该有自治的权利。\n    联合政府必须立即成立，这个联合政府的产生，必不能单由国民党指派人选，各党派必须选出他们自己的代表，国民党的代表也必须由党员选出，而不能由上面一个统治集团加以指派。国民党内有许多派别，而进步的党员一直没有机会发言，现在是实践民主建立民主的时候了。\n    代表从民主方式选出，他们则可进行制定宪法，这宪法将会得到人民的承认和批准。代表们必须在宪法中写上中国人民应有其不可缺少的基本自由，不要任凭那少数企图控制者反复无常，而要完全交托在人民自己的手中。\n    民生主义在今日是指人民不能再受饥饿，一方面让贪官污吏厚积财富，另方面使忠良官吏诉苦无门。土地问题必须合理解决，这并不是共产党或外力的煽动，这是我们本身历史发展的必然结果。一百年前农民的骚动，造成了太平天国的起事，人民有权利起来反抗封建主义与殖民地主义，这已是无可否认的事；今天人民有这种权利，也不容被否认。\n    “耕者有其田”是中山先生的主张，这曾经获取国民党第一次全国代表大会的通过，这是救治中国饥荒的基本方案。行总的署长最近不是说过在中共区内没有灾荒吗，为什么？因为他们遵从中山先生的方案，把土地分配给耕者。这样为民生的打算，在全国各地区应予以考虑。\n    国民党必须执行它的历史任务，领导人民，经由联合政府民权政治及土地改革，达到完全解决。这一个使命如能完成，国民党在任何联合政府中，无疑的都会是领导的政党，他将得到许多属于其他党派的人民的拥护，包括那些没有军队因而在谈判中也无力发言的政党。我们必须让自由的××代替贪污暴政恐怖镇压与政治暗杀，除非国民党立即完成这些任务，他就应担负造成内战的责任。\n    内战不能带给我们以团结解放和民生的安定，内战带给中国人民以混乱饥饿与破坏。\n    我们将见到城市和农民被隔绝，农民会拥护给他们土地和减低租税的共产党，这样，国民党的城市怎样得到原料输出品以至粮食？枪刺不能用以收获，已经吞灭了许多城市的通货膨胀，将千百倍可怕于今日，国民党不能在这样的战争中取得胜利，这些已是众所周知的事，那么，何以反动者还要发动一个他们所不能取胜的战争呢？因为他们希望中国的内争会引起美苏战争，从而在最后摧毁中国的共产党。\n    美国人民是中国人民的同盟者和长久的友人，他们必须知道这条走向灾祸之路的真相，他们必须知道美国的反动者与中国的反动者狼狈为奸相互鼓励的事实，他们必须知道美军的驻在中国土地上，并不能增进中国人民间的和平与秩序，他们必须被警告借款只应给与一个改组了的真正具有代表性的中国政府，他们必须知道若使美国能够坦白表示将不再供给军需品与军事援助，中国的内战就不会扩大发展。\n    今日世界战争的第一个烽火，又在我们的土地上燃烧起来了！它必须扑灭，否则那火焰将毁灭全世界！我要求中国国共两大党以及其他各党各派的领袖，立即组成一个联合政府；我要求我们的美国友人，以停止一切军火供应只允许把援助给予一个属于中国人民的政府，来促成这一行动。"

Those that haven't closed have transformed from merchants with fixed locations to traveling merchants, traveling merchants to small stalls, and small stalls to peddlers, all concentrated in the less than two-acre Gao Ge Temple. This has formed a distorted prosperity. In this single location, the Kuomintang collects 1.6 million yuan in land rent from the stallholders in a single day, which is imaginable. Public opinion says, \"The desolation on the main streets is unprecedented, and the prosperity of Gao Ge Market is unprecedented.\" Rents have soared, and generally, the poor have been driven out.\n\nThe die-hard troops borrow things and don't return them, and when they borrow doors, they take one leaf from each door, so that every family can't close their doors, making it easy to wander around and rape women. The masses deeply hate this. When the die-hard troops go to the Bao Public Office, they demand good food; if they don't eat, they demand money instead, and then they go to other villages to demand again. The masses feel they are just like the \"puppet troops\" and dare to be angry but dare not speak out.\n\nThe students in Anyang's middle schools have a very bad life; they can't get enough congee and steamed buns, and there are no vegetables. Students generally lean towards peace and democracy and are not interested in the Three People's Principles Youth League. They can read newspapers like *Ta Kung Pao*, and when they see reports of the Red Army capturing a certain place, they go outside and cheer: \"Welcome the Eighth Route Army!\" A thought test for students in various schools: \"Is it better to strive for peace through cultural democracy or through military force?\" More than 90% answered the former.

The city was invaded twice by the Chiang Kai-shek army's 12th Army New 36th Division, which attacked from Jinan on the 5th and 18th of last month. After invading Jiyang, the division demolished civilian houses to build fortifications, attempting to occupy it for a long period. It also cooperated with special agents and thugs dispatched by the Kuomintang authorities in Jinan to sabotage the Yellow River repair project in the Bohai Liberated Area, assassinating 27 river workers and civilians, and threatening the masses, saying, \"Whoever goes to repair the river, we will kill their entire family,\" causing the levee repair project below Qingcheng to be forced to stop. With the cooperation of the broad masses of the militia, the Eighth Route Army launched a heroic counterattack on the night of the 24th of last month and recovered the city at dawn on the 25th, with the invading army fleeing towards Jinan.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 1st: As the Chiang army invades Jiangsu and Anhui, the masses in the liberated areas, in coordination with the main force, rose up to defend themselves. The militia in the Suzhong Jing (Jiang) Tai (Xing) Nan (Tong) Ru (Gao) area, from the 15th to the 23rd, successively recovered Xiaohai Town, Daxiaopiegang (both 20 miles southeast of Nantong), Baimuqiao (10 miles east of Jingjiang), Mianshan Town (10 miles northeast of Jingjiang), and other places. The Jiangjing local militia severely damaged the invading Chiang army, capturing 35 Chiang soldiers including regimental adjutants, battalion commanders, and battalion adjutants, as well as one Japanese soldier. They also killed and wounded over 30 Chiang soldiers including battalion commanders. They once stormed into Jijiashi, a major town northeast of Jingjiang, and rescued over 1,000 civilians kidnapped and imprisoned there by the Chiang army.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: On July 27th, the Jidong Eighth Route Army recovered Yanjiao, Maqifa, Banbidian, Baigedian and other villages and towns (all belonging to Sanhe) on the Tang (Shan) Tong (County) highway, more than 40 miles east of Beiping, capturing 150 puppet soldiers of the traitor Jiang Ziting's unit and wounding 40. Yanjiao and Maqifa were liberated by the Eighth Route Army after the Japanese surrendered last year. On January 14th this year, they were invaded and occupied by the traitor Jiang Ziting's unit of the former puppet Sanhe County Garrison, who then encroached upon 72 square li of land in 35 villages and towns including Banbidian, Daliuzhuang, and Zhongxinzhuang. They also rounded up traitors and special agents to establish a puppet Sanhe government-in-exile, with Liu Jianxun, a former translator from Sanhe, as the county magistrate, and Liu Peiya, the special agent group leader, as the head of the political group. The local people suffered from massacres and extortion. Recently, the Chiang army in Tongxian City transported a large amount of munitions, preparing to support the puppet army in launching a large-scale invasion. The local Eighth Route Army launched a counterattack against the puppet army on the 27th, removing the above four puppet military strongholds, allowing the people of dozens of villages and towns in the area to see the light of day again.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东我军恢复济阳城  苏中民兵积极配合主力作战  毙伤俘蒋军团附以下六十余名\n\n1946-08-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东我军恢复济阳城\n    苏中民兵积极配合主力作战\n    毙伤俘蒋军团附以下六十余名\n    【新华社惠民二日电】济南东北六十里的济阳城，经激战后已重为八路军恢复。该城曾于上月五日及十八两度遭由济南出犯之蒋军第十二军新三十六师侵占。该师于侵陷济阳后，即在城内拆毁民房修筑工事，企图长期盘居，并配合由济南国民党当局派出之特务暴徒，破坏渤海解放区的修黄工程，暗杀河工人员及群众二十七人，并威胁群众说：“谁去修河，杀他全家”，致青城以下之修堤工程被迫停顿。八路军在广大民兵配合下，于上月二十四日夜间展开英勇反击，于二十五日拂晓恢复该城，进犯军向济南逃窜。\n    【新华社淮阴一日电】蒋军侵犯苏皖，所到之处，解放区群众配合主力奋起自卫，苏中靖（江）泰（兴）南（通）如（皋）地区民兵，自十五日至二十三日间，曾先后收复小海镇、大小撇港（均在南通东南二十里）、柏木桥（靖江东十里）、面山镇（靖江东北十里）等地，江靖地方民兵曾重创出犯蒋军，生俘蒋军团附、营长、营附以下三十五名及日兵一名，毙伤蒋军营长以下三十余名，并曾一度攻入靖江东北重镇季家市，救出被蒋军绑架囚禁该市之群众千余人。\n    【新华社延安二日电】冀东八路军于七月二十七日恢复北平东四十余里唐（山）通（县）公路上之燕郊、马起垡、半壁店、白各店等村镇（均三河属），俘伪军姜逆子廷部一百五十名，伤四十名。按燕郊及马起垡。去年日寇投降后即为八路军解放，今年一月十四日被原伪三河县警备队姜逆子廷部侵占后，又将半壁店、大刘庄、中心庄等卅五个村镇面积七十二平方华里土地蚕食，并收罗汉奸特务成立伪三河流亡县政府，由原三河的翻译官刘建勋任县长，特务组长刘赔亚任政治组长，当地人民备遭屠杀勒索之苦。最近通县城蒋军更运来大批军火，准备支援伪军大举出犯，当地八路军乃于二十七日向该伪实行反击，拔除上述四个伪军据点后，该地数十村镇人民得以重见天日。"

In light of this situation, in addition to organizing the teachers to examine the leadership and exchange experiences, the leadership immediately called on everyone to settle down and work, serving the masses' cultural and educational endeavors, and resoundingly proposed launching the county-wide Red Star Primary School (i.e., model primary school) movement. The standards at the time were: 1. Strive for an enrollment rate of 80% of children both inside and outside the school. 2. Closely integrate with society, production, family, and war. 3. Create experiences and exchange experiences. The leadership clearly announced that whoever achieved these standards would be a model; teachers who became Red Star Primary School teachers would receive a merit citation.\n\n　　The majority of teachers expressed enthusiastic support for this movement. It encouraged a new heroism among the teachers, stabilized their wavering emotions, and every teacher was swept up in the Red Star Primary School movement.\n\n　　(II) The Teachers' Determination\n\n　　After the meeting, the teachers had great enthusiasm, but the masses' understanding of the school still had a distance to go. At this time, the teachers held parent-teacher conferences to conduct ideological mobilization, ensuring that children would learn skills and periodically inviting parents to the school for face-to-face examinations, initially smoothing out the masses' thinking. Another difficulty was that the busy farming season affected children's enrollment. At this time, the teachers tried their best to combine learning with production. For example, they mobilized children to work with mutual aid teams, organizing children to contract work, exchange labor, and cut firewood. Because the teachers actively came up with solutions, the number of students in each school surged, which gave the teachers even more enthusiasm and allowed them to display creativity, laying a preliminary foundation for the development of cultural and educational work in Zuoquan.\n\n　　(III) The Key to the Movement\n\n　　During the Mid-Autumn Festival, each school held an achievement exhibition and a forum for parents, reporting on the school's work and allowing parents to see their children's achievements firsthand. At the meeting, they proposed an educational policy of \"learn whatever you want to learn, teach whatever you want to be taught.\" Many people who visited the exhibition understood that the students' achievements were the result of the teachers' hard work, and at the forum, they all reflected on how their past assistance to the teachers had been insufficient, and that they would pay attention in the future. Some villages even automatically raised the teachers' salaries by one level, and some were even willing to sell land to let their children study.\n\n　　At the same time, the leadership launched a county-wide movement to support teachers. Each village sent many fruits, mooncakes, and other gifts to the teachers, which greatly encouraged the teachers' morale. Some \"sojourner teachers\" who wanted to leave the education profession also settled down to work.\n\n　　After the exhibition, the parent-teacher conference, and the movement to support teachers, the Red Star Primary School movement was universally launched, penetrating into every village, child, and mass.\n\n　　(IV) Preliminary Selection\n\n　　After the Mid-Autumn Festival's movement to support teachers, the goals of stabilizing teachers' emotions and developing cultural and educational work had been initially achieved. In October, a county-wide primary school teacher conference was held to conduct a preliminary selection of Red Star Primary Schools, exchange experiences, and study experiences. At this time, in addition to the nineteen candidate Red Star Primary Schools selected by the administrative district, there were also three primary schools that voluntarily participated in the election, and the leadership also encouraged this spirit. After democratic discussion, the ten Red Star Primary Schools of Pan'nao, Tongtan, Jianmiao, Xiazhuang, Donghuangzhang, Sipingqian, Shilidian, Shangzhuang, and Liangyu were finally selected through anonymous voting combined with the discussion of the evaluation committee. All teachers and principals of the Red Star Primary Schools were given a merit citation by the county government, and these ten primary schools were named the first batch of Red Star Primary Schools in ×× village. This spirit of doing what was said established the leadership's prestige; this practice of timely summarizing and studying experiences enlightened the teachers' work direction. At the same time, after research, the standards of the Red Star Primary School were raised again, calling on everyone to continue their efforts to conduct a re-election in the county during the April 4th Children's Day this year. The standards are: 1. Regular enrollment of 80% of children, with significant achievements in organizing out-of-school children and teaching management. 2. Good implementation of the new education policy and integration with all aspects. 3. Integration with social education, enabling winter schools and primary schools to promote each other. 4. Close relationship between teachers and the masses (including cadres) in educating the masses.\n\n　　After this preliminary selection, various types of model villages were established. For example, Pan'nao is a dispersed village with more than two hundred households in thirteen small mountain villages scattered over forty-five miles, with distances of more than ten miles between them. Tongtan, Siping, and Xiazhuang are larger towns with enrollment rates of over 85%. Shilidian was just liberated from the enemy's iron hooves. Qiancun is a typical example of a model winter school transformed into a private primary school. Jianmiao crawled out of the famine, achieving a situation where only one of the village's thirty-nine children was out of school. Donghuangzhang and Liangyu are representatives of general villages. The villages that were selected as Red Star Primary Schools all held victory celebrations. The teachers' morale was raised, and the masses' morale was also high. The Red Star Primary School movement was widely and deeply developed throughout the county.\n\n　　Because there were new goals to strive for, significant achievements were made in integrating with social education and mass relations during the winter and around the Spring Festival. For example, the characters on the literacy boards in Shilidian were the same as the farmers' literacy lessons, allowing students to go home and teach adults, achieving mutual promotion between winter schools and primary schools. During the busy spring season, Lianbi organized children to deliver manure, help the village deliver letters, and carry water for the families of soldiers to sow seeds, which was supported by the masses and aroused the concern of cadres and the masses for the school.\n\n　　Because there were achievements that the masses could see and things were truly done for the masses, the masses actively took action to pay attention to and care about the school. This spring, 80% of the villages in Zuoquan repaired classrooms. Labor hero Liu Xirong of Matian and political commissar Ma of the Fourth District actively promoted the establishment of private complete primary schools. New shops, Xiazhuang, and other places, under the active promotion of district chiefs, political commissars, village cadres, and the masses, developed three private senior classes. This shows that the masses recognize the benefits of \"the school is their own and should be run by themselves.\" This is a concrete manifestation of the masses' demand to be liberated culturally after being economically and politically liberated, and it is also the achievement of half a year of the Red Star Primary School movement.\n\n　　(V) A Victorious Summary\n\n　　To coincide with this year's \"April 4th\" Children's Day, the county loudly proposed the \"Love Children\" movement, mobilizing teachers and parents to care for children, especially helping poor children solve difficulties such as books, stationery, and clothing. This call was immediately met with enthusiastic response. Some donated money, some donated grain, some shops and cooperatives offered large discounts for children for three days, and some teachers even donated foreign currency to have a feast for the children. This raised the social status and learning enthusiasm of children, making the relationship between children and teachers, the masses, and the school closer, and pushing the county's education work a step further.\n\n　　As the county was about to summarize the Red Star Primary School, it used great efforts to prepare for the cultural and educational conference, creating public opinion throughout the county, so that everyone paid attention to summarizing the work of the Red Star Primary School. Therefore, when the county cultural and educational conference was held on June 1st, as soon as you entered Zuoquan, if you asked any of the masses, they would all know that the county was holding a cultural and educational conference.\n\n　　During the meeting, County Chief Huang and the Minister of Propaganda of the County Party Committee personally participated in the group and presided over the entire process of the conference. After listening to the reports of the model teachers and the opinions of the representatives of the Red Star Primary Schools, the presidium and the education assistant jointly selected nineteen Red Star Primary Schools. The first prize included Qiancun, Xiazhuang, Jianmiao, and Pan'nao; the second prize included Shilidian, Tongtan, Xiguan, Lianbi, Zhuangshang, Xihetou, Donghuangzhang, Siping, and Shangwu; the third prize included Matian, Baiyu, Hanwang, Majiu, Changcheng, and Sucheng. All first and second prize primary schools were given a beautifully crafted wooden plaque by the county's cultural and educational conference, with the inscription \"Presented to ×× Village Red Star Primary School.\" From then on, the masses saw the importance of education work. At this point, the Red Star Primary School movement, which had been developing for a year, came to an end.\n\n　　In order to consolidate existing achievements and bring the Red Star Primary School movement into a new stage of improvement and balance, after everyone's brewing and discussion, new standards were formulated: (1) Organize more than 90% of children to attend school, and make significant achievements for children outside the school. (2) Achieve mass self-management and mass management, establish school housekeeping, and reduce the burden on the people. (3) Implement democratic management methods, closely connect teacher-student relationships, cultivate activists, and transform naughty children. (4) Create experiences, spread experiences, and assist nearby primary schools in balanced development. (5) The school is closely integrated with social education, promoting each other.\n\n　　(VI) A Few Experiences\n\n　　The Zuoquan Red Star Primary School movement was a victory, and the main reason was the leadership's responsibility and implementation of the spirit. The leaders attached importance to this work ideologically, placing it in a primary position, issuing timely calls (supporting teachers, exhibitions, loving children), clearly putting forward goals, and conducting timely inspections and summaries. Through the work of each period, the Red Star Primary School movement penetrated into every teacher, every child, and every mass and cadre. Moreover, the leadership was able to correctly inspire the teachers' new heroism, so that primary school education in the past year made significant achievements, and the teachers' dedication was developed. On this basis, the enthusiasm of the masses to run schools themselves was inspired, and some budding but very valuable experiences in mass self-run schools were created. And able to run schools according to the opinions of the masses, implement the new education policy of \"what to learn and what to do.\"\n\n　　After the Red Star Primary School movement, education work has made new progress and promoted the cultural and educational work of the entire county.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 左权红星小学运动\n\n1946-08-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　左权红星小学运动\n    （一）运动的提出\n    去年五月县里集训教员时，发现教员们对领导上有许多意见，如认为自己是“没媳孩”，“当教员没有前途”等。加之形势发展干部纷纷外调，更使教员情绪动荡。根据这种情况，领导上除组织教员们对领导进行检查交流经验外，随即号召大家安心工作，为群众文教工作服务，响亮提出开展全县范围的红星小学（即模范小学）运动。当时的标准是：一、争取校内外百分之八十儿童就学。二、和社会、生产、家庭、战争密切结合。三、创造经验交流经验。领导上明确的宣布，谁争取到这个标准就是模范；成为红星小学的教员，一律记功一次。\n    对于这一运动，大部份教员表示热烈响应。它鼓励了教员的新英雄主义，安定了教员的动荡情绪，每个教员都卷入红星小学运动的浪潮里。\n    （二）教员的决心\n    会议后，教员劲头很大，但群众对学校的认识还有一个距离。这时教员们召开家长会进行思想动员，保证儿童学会本事，定期请家长来校当面考试，初步疏通了群众思想。另一个困难是农忙时节影响儿童入学。这时教员们想尽办法，使学习与生产结合。如动员儿童与互助组结合，组织儿童包工、换工、割柴等。由于教员们积极想办法，各校学生激增，因之，教员劲头更大，且能发挥创造性，初步打下了开展左权文教工作的基础。\n    （三）运动的关键\n    中秋节，各校举行了成绩展览会，和家长座谈会，报告学校工作，使家长们亲眼看到自己子女的成绩，且在会上提出想怎念就怎念，要学啥就教啥的教育方针。许多群众参观展览会都知道学生的成绩是教员们努力辛苦得来的，且在座谈会上都检讨过去对教员的帮助不够，今后要注意，且有些村自动把教员的待遇提高一级，有的还愿卖地让孩子念书。\n    同时领导上发动了全县的拥师运动，各村给教员送了许多水果、月饼等礼物，对教员情绪鼓舞很大，有些想脱离教育工作的“作客教员”，也安心了工作。\n    经过展览会，家长会和拥师运动，红星小学运动普遍开展起来，它深入到每个村庄的儿童和群众中。\n    （四）初选\n    经过中秋节的拥师运动，已初步达到安定教员情绪与开展文教工作的目的。十月间召开全县小学教员会议，进行红星小学初选，彼此交流经验，研究经验。这时除由行政区选出的十九个候选红星小学外，还有三个小学自动参加竞选，领导上也鼓励了这种精神。经过民主讨论，最后以不记名投票配合评委会的讨论，选出了盘垴、桐滩、尖庙、下庄、东黄漳、寺坪前＠、十里店、上庄、梁峪十个红星小学。凡是红星小学的教员与校长，由县府各记功一次，并将这十个小学命名为××村初选红星小学。这种说到做到的精神，树立了领导上的威信；这种及时总结和研究经验的作法，启示了教员的工作方向。同时经过研究，又提高了红星小学的标准，号召大家继续努力，于今年四四节在县进行复选，其标准是：一、经常有百分之八十儿童入学，适当的组织校外儿童，教学管理上有显著成绩者。二、贯彻新教育方针，与各方面结合的好者。三、与社会教育结合，能使冬学与小学相互影响下共同推进者。四、在教育群众中，教员与群众（包括干部）关系密切者。\n    经过这次初选，树立了各种类型的模范村，如盘垴，是一个周围四十五里，相距十余里，十三个小山庄共二百余户的分散村庄；桐滩、寺坪、下庄系较大村镇，入学儿童均在百分之八十五以上；十里店为刚从敌人铁蹄下解放出来的；前＠村为模范冬学转成民办小学的典型；尖庙是从灾荒中爬出来，做到全村三十九个儿童，只有一人失学的村子；东黄漳和梁峪为一般村的代表。当选红星小学的村庄，都召开了祝捷大会，教员情绪提高了，群众情绪也高了，红星小学运动便在全县范围内广泛深入的开展起来。\n    因为有了新的奋斗目标，在冬季和年关前后对结合社会教育及群众关系上，就做出了显著成绩。如十里店识字牌上的字与农民的识字课相同，让学生回家教大人，做到了冬学与小学互相推进；连壁在春忙时，组织儿童送粪，帮村上送信，给抗属抬水下种等，得到群众拥护，引起了干部与群众对学校的关心。\n    因为有了群众看得见的成绩，又真正为群众办了事情，群众就积极行动起来，注意和关心学校，今春左权有百分之八十的村子修教室。麻田劳动英雄刘锡荣和四区马政委积极推动民办完小的成立；新店、下庄等都在区长政委村干部和群众的积极推动下，发展了三个民办高级班。这说明群众认识到了“学校是自己的，应该自己来办”的好处。这是群众在经济上政治上翻身后，又要求在文化上翻身的具体表现，也是半年红星小学运动的成绩。\n    （五）胜利的总结\n    配合今年“四四”儿童节，县里又响亮的提出“爱儿”运动，发动教员与家长爱护儿童，特别是帮助贫苦儿童解决书籍文具衣服等困难。这号召马上得到了热烈的响应，有的献钱，有的献粮，有的商店及合作社为儿童大减价三天，有的教员还捐洋为儿童会餐，这样提高了儿童的社会地位和学习情绪，使儿童与教员、群众与学校的关系更密切，把全县教育工作又推进了一步。\n    快到总结全县红星小学时，县里用了很大力量准备文教大会，造成全县舆论，使大家都注意总结红星小学这一工作，所以在六月一日举行县文教大会时，一入左权境，随便问到一个群众，他都知道县里正开文教大会。\n    在开会时，黄县长和县委宣传部长亲自参加小组，主持了大会的全部过程，听取了模范教员的报告与红星小学代表的意见后，主席团和教育助理员等共同评选了十九个红星小学。计一等有前＠、下庄、尖庙，盘垴；二等有十里店、桐滩、西关、连壁、庄上、西河头、东黄漳、寺坪、上武；三等有麻田、柏峪、寒王、马厩、长城、粟城。所有一二等小学，统由县文教大会名义，各赠给精制木匾一块，上书“赠给××村红星小学”。从此群众看到了教育工作的重要。至此，一年来发展的红星小学运动告一段落。\n    为巩固已有成绩，使红星小学运动进入提高与平衡的新阶段，经过大家的酝酿讨论，又订出了新的标准：（一）组织百分之九十以上的儿童就学，对校外的儿童做出显著的成绩。（二）做到群众自办，群众管理，建立学校家务，减轻人民负担。（三）贯彻民主管理方式，密切师生关系，培养积极份子，改造顽皮儿童。（四）创造经验，传播经验，辅助附近的小学平衡发展。（五）学校与社会教育密切结合，互相推动。\n    （六）几点经验\n    左权红星小学运动胜利了，其主要原因是由于领导上的负责和贯彻精神。领导者在思想上重视了这一工作，把这个工作放在首要的位置，适时提出号召（拥师、展览、爱儿），明确提出奋斗目标，及时进行检查与总结，通过各个时期的工作，使红星小学运动深入到每个教员每个儿童以后每个群众与干部中去。且领导上能正确的启发教员们的新英雄主义，使一年来的小学教育有了显著的成绩，教员们的事业精神得到了发扬。在这样的基础上，启发了群众自己办学的积极性，且创造了一些萌芽的却十分宝贵的群众自办学校的经验。而且能够根据群众意见办学校，实行“要学啥就做啥”的新教育方针。\n    经过红星小学运动，教育工作有了新的开展，且推动了全县的文教工作。"

    "title": "General Teng Daiyuan Speaks: Tensely Unite, Rely on the Masses, Self-Defense Will Surely Be Victorious",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-05",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 2nd: General Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Eighteenth Group Army, recently passed through the Suwan Border Region and made a statement to this agency's reporter, saying: The reactionaries have recently launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas, especially against the Central Plains and Central China Military Regions. However, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, Wang Shusheng, and others led their troops to break through and inflicted great blows on the invading army together with the military and civilians of Central China, which has frustrated the military conspiracy of the reactionaries. General Teng expressed his appreciation for the firm and heroic self-defense of the military and civilians of Suwan, who have repeatedly annihilated the main force of the invading army. He believes that a large amount of annihilation of the enemy's living forces is an important factor in determining the final victory or defeat, and the temporary advance or retreat of a city or place is not important. In this Suzhong self-defense war, not only were 25,000 invading troops annihilated, but also the number of weapons seized was unprecedented, which will help to further strengthen the Central China People's Liberation Army and the people's armed forces. What is especially important is that this strong self-defense fully proves that we have the strength to defend the liberated areas, defend peace and democracy, and defeat all the offensives of the reactionaries. He said: As long as we are tensely united and rely on the masses, without arrogance or complacency, self-defense will surely be victorious. General Teng was extremely indignant at the crimes of the Kuomintang's planes indiscriminately bombing everywhere, causing serious damage to the lives and property of innocent people; he highly praised the democratic government's work in providing relief and assistance. General Teng solemnly stated in conclusion: If the reactionaries do not stop their offensive for a single day, the military and civilians of the liberated areas cannot stop their self-defense and resistance for a single day. If the reactionaries continue to act recklessly, their strength will become increasingly dispersed, and they will be enemies everywhere they go deep into our liberated areas, and they will inevitably suffer a more powerful blow from our army. At the same time as attacking the liberated areas, the reactionaries are brutally suppressing the democratic movement throughout the country, and assassinating Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. This perverse act will undoubtedly arouse a more enthusiastic and widespread movement to defend peace and democracy throughout the country. The reactionaries' use of such barbaric and despicable means does not indicate that they have strength, but rather shows their increasing decline. General Teng finally solemnly stated: We do not hope for war; we, like the people of the whole country, are eagerly looking forward to the realization of peace and democracy. We are forced to resolutely defend ourselves in order to defend peace and democracy, so as long as the reactionaries stop their offensive actions and withdraw from the occupied areas, peace negotiations can be realized.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 滕代远将军谈话  紧张团结依靠群众自卫一定能够胜利\n\n1946-08-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　滕代远将军谈话\n    紧张团结依靠群众自卫一定能够胜利\n    【新华社淮阴二日电】十八集团军副参谋长滕代远将军，日前路过苏皖边区，对本社记者发表谈话称：反动派最近全面进攻解放区，尤以对中原、华中两军区最为猛烈，但中原李先念、王震、王树声等率部突破，与华中军民予进犯军以极大打击，已使反动派之军事阴谋遭到挫折。滕将军于对苏皖军民坚决英勇自卫，数次歼灭进犯军主力，表示嘉许。渠认为大量消灭对方有生力量，为决定最后胜负之重要因素，一城一地之暂时进退，无关重要。此次苏中自卫战中，不但消灭进犯军两万五千之众，而且缴获武器之多，在此可称为空前未有，此对进一步加强华中子弟兵与人民武装力量不无帮助。尤其重要的是此次坚强自卫，充分证明了我们有力量保卫解放区，保卫和平民主，战胜一切反动派的进攻。他说：只要我们紧张团结依靠群众，不骄不馁，自卫一定能够胜利。滕将军对蒋方飞机到处滥肆轰炸，使无辜人民生命财产遭受严重损害之罪行，极为愤恨；对民主政府之安抚与救济工作颇加赞扬。滕将军最后郑重表示：反动派一日不停止进攻，解放区军民便一日不能停止自卫抵抗，反动派如一味蛮干下去，则由于其力量之日益分散，深入我解放区处处与之为敌，势必遭受我军更有力的打击。与进攻解放区同时，反动派在全国范围内残酷镇压民主运动，暗杀民盟中委李公朴、闻一多两先生，这种倒行逆施无疑将引起全国更热烈更广泛的保卫和平民主运动，反动派出此野蛮卑劣手段，不是表示他们有力量，而是说明他们的日渐衰落。滕将军最后郑重表示：我们并不希望战争，我们和全国人民一样切盼和平民主的实现，我们被迫坚决自卫，也是为了保卫和平民主，所以只要反动派停止进攻行动，退出侵占区，则和平谈判可以实现。"

Representatives of various countries continued to make general speeches at the Plenary Session. Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Pötzel, Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Mr. Kardelj, Representative of New Zealand, Mr. Nashan, and Representative of Norway, Mr. Lange, all delivered speeches on the day. The Program Rules Committee continued its debate on the 1st. The issue of the number of votes required to pass resolutions in the Plenary Session and various subcommittees remains unresolved. According to American participants: Mr. Byrnes is prepared to propose a compromise between the two opinions, namely, important proposals that fail to obtain a two-thirds vote may still be submitted to the Four Powers for consideration, but can only be sent as \"proposals\" without the full force of formal \"recommendations\" from the meeting. According to a United Press reporter's analysis: Judging from the current situation, nine countries are certain to support a two-thirds majority vote: the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. Abyssinia, New Zealand, Norway, and Brazil may also vote in favor. The confirmed opponents are currently Australia, the Netherlands, and Greece. When the Program Rules Committee met yesterday, the Greek representative, Mr. Sindaris, suggested that provisions should be made to allow free discussion of any issue \"concerning a just and lasting peace.\" The Yugoslavian representative opposed the Greek representative's amendment, arguing that this would cause the meeting to fall into lengthy debates beyond the time allotted for the issue of drafting the Five-Power peace treaty. If the Greek proposal is adopted, any delegation will effectively be able to place any item on the agenda. Mr. Molotov put forward a compromise proposal, suggesting that the rules of procedure of the meeting could be amended to add the following sentence: \"On any issue concerning the draft peace treaty, the Plenary Session may include it in the meeting agenda upon the application of any delegation.\" Mr. ×× Dovate advised all small countries to accept this proposal, and it was declared passed. Afterwards, the committee encountered difficulties again. The Dutch representative demanded that all twenty-one countries should be represented not only on the Steering Committee but also on all committees, while the original decision of the Four Powers was that all committees except the Steering Committee should be handed over to the countries that had actually acted against each relevant defeated country. Mr. Molotov put forward a new compromise proposal, namely, to allow all twenty-one countries to attend any committee meeting, but other countries would have no voting rights except for those that had actually fought against the respective defeated countries. The outcome of the discussion is unknown.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 程序规则委员会继续辩论通过决议票数问题未解决\n\n1946-08-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　程序规则委员会继续辩论通过决议票数问题未解决\n    【新华社延安二日电】巴黎讯：和会之大会与程序规则委员会于一日仍在分别举行，各国代表继续在大会上作一般发言，荷外长波茨雷、南副总理卡德尔、新西兰代表纳森、挪威代表兰吉均于是日发表演说。程序规则委员会于一日继续辩论，会中关于大会与各小组委员会通过决议所需票数问题仍未解决。据美国与会人士宣称：贝纳斯准备在两种意见之间提出一种妥协办法，即未能获得三分之二票数之重要提案仍可提交四强考虑，但仅能当作“提议”送交，而无会议正式“建议”的充分力量。据合众社记者分析：就现势看来，有九个国家一定赞成三分之二多数表决的，有美、英、苏、法、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、南斯拉夫与捷克，而阿比西尼亚、新西兰、挪威及巴西亦可能投赞成票，确定反对者，现为澳洲、荷兰及希腊。程序规则委员会于昨日开会时，希腊代表新达利斯建议应规定允许对任何“有关公正持久和平”的问题进行自由的讨论，南代表反对希代表的修正案，认为此将使会议陷于超过制定五国和约问题时间之外的长时争论，如果希腊之建议通过，则任何代表团实际上均将能在议事日程上安置任何项目。莫洛托夫提出妥协案，建议会议规则程序可以修改，其中增加下述语句：“关于和约草案之任何问题，倘经任何代表团之申请时，大会得将其列入会议程序”。××多瓦特劝告所有小国接受此一提议，于是宣告通过。此后委员会又遇到困难，荷代表要求二十一国不仅在指导委员会而且在一切委员会应有代表参加，而四强原来的决定是除指导委员会之外，一切委员会均应交诸对每个有关战败国实际作用的国家。莫洛托夫又提出新的妥协案，即准许所有二十一国参加任何委员会的会议，但除了对各该战败国实际作战之国家外，其他国家无表决权。讨论结果未悉。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 2nd: Paris dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered his first speech at the Peace Conference on the 31st. The summary is as follows:\n　　This peace conference will play an important role in establishing peace and security. The conference will express its opinions and make its own suggestions on the draft treaties of peace with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. We declare: Failure to punish the satellite states of the German alliance for the acts of aggression committed by their governing authorities and the responsibilities they bear, and refusal to uphold the rights of countries that have suffered from aggression, have nothing in common with the interests of just peace. This can only be exploited by those who hold the goals of hegemonic, predatory imperialism to engage in new aggression. In the past, the Soviet government has fulfilled certain provisions stipulated in the armistice agreement, which demonstrates its willingness to help these countries' general post-war economic recovery. In the draft treaties of the five countries, it is specifically stated that the revival of fascism must be restricted and the democratic foundations of Germany's former satellite states must be consolidated. In this respect, the current draft treaties are very different from the treaties after the First World War. The several draft treaties submitted to this conference were prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers. The Council of Foreign Ministers was established at the Berlin Conference last year. This resolution was proposed by the United States, and the Soviet government agreed with this proposal from the beginning and has consistently and unflinchingly implemented these resolutions accurately. The issue of establishing the Council of Foreign Ministers lies in formulating common resolutions and resolving issues through consultation, rather than forcing certain countries to accept one's own will. The example of formulating draft treaties shows that the Council of Foreign Ministers has achieved certain good results. However, it cannot be denied that certain reactionary elements intentionally holding anti-Soviet aims are attacking the resolutions of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and they intend to undermine the cooperation of the great powers. The draft treaties submitted to the conference are a new blow to these gentlemen. As long as the conference recognizes that the democratic countries are working here in the interests of consolidating universal peace and the security of all countries, large and small, the conference has the possibility of broadly discussing all issues of the treaty. The plenipotentiary delegations representing twenty-one countries at our conference may freely express their opinions, expressing agreement or disagreement with any part of any treaty. Any such opinion will receive due respect and attention, and will provide a lot of help for the final review of the treaty. Here we also listen to the opinions of Germany's former satellite states. The Soviet delegation believes that we will estimate the voices of these countries with due attention. All of this gives us reason to hope that the work of the conference will achieve practical success and benefit all peace-loving people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫洛托夫和会演说  和约草案与第一次大战后和约有别望和会工作切实成功造福和平人民\n\n1946-08-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　莫洛托夫和会演说\n    和约草案与第一次大战后和约有别望和会工作切实成功造福和平人民\n    【新华社延安二日电】巴黎讯：苏外长莫洛托夫于三十一日在和会首次发表演说，摘要如下：\n    此次和会，在树立和平与安全事业上将起着重要的作用，和会对于意、罗、保、匈、芬的和约草案发表意见，提出自己的建议。我们声明：与德国联盟的附庸国对于自己执行当局所干的侵略行为并担负的责任，如不加以惩罚，与拒绝拥护遭受侵略灾害的国家的权利，是与正义和平利益毫无共同点的，这只能为那些持恶霸强盗帝国主义目的人们从事新的侵略所利用。在过去时期，苏联政府履行了停战协定所规定的某些条款，这就表明了愿意帮助这些国家战后经济一般的复兴。在五国和约草案中，特别说必须限制法西斯主义的复活，必须巩固德国以前附庸国的民主基础。在这点上，现在的和约草案与第一次世界大战之后的和约有很大的分别，本次和会提出的几个和约草案是外长委员会准备好的。外长委员会是在去年柏林会议上设立的，这一决议是由美国提议的，苏联政府一开始就赞同这种提议，并且经常不屈不挠的准确实行这些决议。设立外长委员会的问题，就是在于制定共同的决议，以协商的方式解决问题，而不是在于强迫某些国家接受自己的意志。制定和约草案的例子，就可以看到外长委员会已达到一定的良好成绩。然而，也不能否认这样的事实：某些有意的抱着反苏目的的反动分子在攻击外长委员会的决议，他们打算破坏列强的合作，提交和会的和约草案对于这些老爷们是一个新的打击。只要大会认识一下，就可以知道各民主国家在这里进行工作，就是本着力图巩固普遍和平与各国人民安全的大小国家的利益。和会有可能广泛讨论和约的一切问题，在我们和会上代表二十一个国家的全权代表团，都可能自由发表自己的意见，对于任何和约的某一部份表示同意或不同意，任何此种意见会受到应有的尊重与注意，并且对于最终审查和约将给予不少的帮助。在这里同样倾听德国以前附庸国的意见，苏联代表团相信我们将会以应有的注意力估计到这些国家的呼声，这一切使我们有根据指望和会工作将得到切实的成功，为一切爱好和平的人民谋利益。"

Immediately afterwards, they flew to a place about 500 meters away from the Wangjiaping Yan'an headquarters and dropped 11 bombs. Fragments of bombs and shell casings were found, and it was confirmed that the bombs were American-made deep-penetration bombs, and the bullets were American-made \"BM43\" machine gun bullets of about half an inch in diameter. Captain Liu Shanben, who flew a \"B24\" aircraft to Yan'an against the civil war, was also hit and burned. After the incident, U.S. military observers Lieutenant Colonel Yang and Major Boertuo drove to the bombed and strafed area for inspection. Yan'an City was first bombed by Japanese aircraft on December 20, 1938, and was bombed many times until the last bombing in 1941. It has not been attacked by air since then.

Starting from Lujiaqiao, more than 30 miles north of Huangtu County (formerly Xinhua County), the flood rolled southward, with a water volume of about 50 miles and a length of more than 100 miles. Within two days, 54 villages in Cangxian and Huanghua counties in the liberated area were turned into swamps. More than 1,000 hectares of fertile land were flooded, houses collapsed, livestock were washed away, and the autumn crops that the people had worked hard to plant, which were about to be harvested, were now all in vain.

In addition, the masses have gone to the front lines to participate in the war. In the Fifth District, out of the entire district's 100,000 mu of crops, more than 10,000 mu of cotton still needs weeding. At the production committee symposium on the 22nd of this month, everyone unanimously agreed that if the land cannot be weeded, and each mu yields one dou less, then more than 10,000 shi of grain will be lost; if each mu yields one jin less of cotton, then more than 10,000 jin will be lost. The district headquarters committee believes that this work is not simply a production task, but a concrete mission to support the front lines against the civil war. It specifically calls on all district cadres, male and female labor heroes, mutual aid group members, students, teachers, workers, merchants, and all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women to urgently mobilize and participate in the production front line of emergency weeding, implementing challenge competitions between villages, neighborhoods, groups, and individuals, and launching a large-scale emergency weeding campaign throughout the district. The district headquarters organized inspection teams to help mobilize in various villages. In order to boost production morale, they proposed: whichever village first completes weeding, guarantees no idle land, and punches the card, the district headquarters will present a large plaque of \"Production Model Village,\" publish praise in the newspaper, and request the county government to issue a commendation. Their slogan is \"Not an acre idle, not a person unoccupied, not a moment wasted, weeding one more seedling is better than weeding none.\" The production committee members of each village, after hearing this call, studied organizational mobilization methods and urgently returned to their villages to organize. Cadres in the Fifth District punched the card for weeding three mu of cotton during their lunch break. The masses in Liu Village said: \"District cadres are not even resting at noon, so we should work even harder. We must respond to the call of the district headquarters and get the land weeded well in a short period of time.\" All villages are enthusiastically organizing and carrying out this work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不荒一亩地不闲一个人  阳城五区突击锄苗\n\n1946-08-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　不荒一亩地不闲一个人\n    阳城五区突击锄苗\n    【本报阳城讯】阳城今夏雨水连绵，加以群众到前方参战，五区全区十万亩庄稼，一万多亩棉花尚有一部未锄。本月二十二日生产委员座谈会上大家都一致认为，如果不能把地锄了，以每亩地少收一斗计，就要少收一万多石粮食；一亩少收一斤花，就要少收一万多斤。区指挥部委员会认为这一工作不是单纯的生产工作，是支援前线反内战的具体任务。特号召全区干部、男女劳动英雄、互助组组员、学生教员、工人、商人、男女全半劳力，紧急动员起来一致参加到突击锄苗的生产战线上，实行村与村、闾与闾、组与组、人与人的挑战竞赛，掀起全区大规模的突击锄苗运动。并由区指挥部组织检查组，到各村帮助动员。为了提高生产情绪，提出：如那个村首先完成锄苗打卡保证一亩不荒者，区指挥部赠给“生产模范村”大匾一面，并登报表扬，呈请县府传令嘉奖。他们的口号是“不荒一亩地，不闲一个人，不误一点钟，多锄一苗顶一苗。”各村生产委员听了这个号召，研究了组织动员等办法，紧急的回村去组织。五区各干部在午睡时打卡棉花三亩。刘村群众说：“区干部都不歇晌午，咱们更要好好干。一定要响应区指挥部号召，在短期内把地锄好。”各村都在热烈组织进行这一工作。"

    "author": "Liu Zhao",
    "date": "1946-08-06",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Labor Model Zhang Jinsheng\n    ——Communication from Limin Coal Mine\n    Liu Zhao\n    Zhang Jinsheng, with a coal-blackened, rectangular face and a bushy beard, was a tall, forty-something-year-old who, four months ago, was the living committee member of the fourth joint branch of miners in the Tongshun well of the Limin Coal Mine Company. At that time, the fourth joint branch was a very poor branch. In addition to the administrator (the old foreman), the union chairman, the production committee member, the “dagulou” (the small boss of the coal basket), and he himself, as the living committee member, still had the exploitative consciousness that was left over from being infected by the bourgeoisie. They didn't want to move themselves, didn't participate in production, and even wanted the workers to carry them, acting as parasites. Therefore, they didn't care about the organization and distribution of labor or the lives of the workers. When they went down the pit, they just wandered around and finished with a grunt or two. In the words of the production committee member, their minds were twisted, thinking, \"Whether I produce more or less, I'll split a chicken leg, and I'm not afraid of not getting my share!\" Although Zhang Jinsheng had worked in the Modeng coal kiln in Wuxiang in the old liberated area and knew a little about the wrongness of exploiting people, he always felt that it was an ancient rule for workers to carry the leaders, so he just followed along. Moreover, not moving and eating other people's labor made him happy. With the cadres like this, the workers below were burdened too heavily, felt uncomfortable, and lacked energy to work, so they all became passively resistant. The small boss said, \"If you don't want to move, who else wants to move? We can't carry this much, we earn less, and he won't earn much more.\" Sometimes they would deliberately break the basket and ask the big boss to repair it for him so he could secretly loaf around.\n\n    Those who were mining would stop if they saw hard coal, and sometimes deliberately hacked at the hard coal, breaking the pickaxe tip in a couple of strokes. This was good: \"You rest, let's rest too!\"\n\n    Those pushing the carts would rest even if there were no carts to push and wouldn't look for them. If you didn't urge him, he wouldn't come down after going up to find a cart.\n\n    Therefore, in April, both coal production and wages lagged far behind other branches.\n\n    At the beginning of April, the trade union started a training class in preparation for the Red May Great Production Campaign. Zhang Jinsheng was also transferred to receive training. After studying for more than ten days, Zhang Jinsheng came back with a new mindset. He understood that the poverty and suffering of workers and peasants were due to the bad system of the old society, with the oppression and exploitation of landlords and capitalists. He no longer believed in \"poverty and wealth are determined by fate, if you have fate, you will have good fortune.” He completely agreed with, \"Only labor can provide food; no labor, no food.” In particular, the speech of the union’s director Duo reminded him: \"Chairman Mao's slogan is 'Serve the people,' and the trade union is to serve the workers, to be a logistics worker for the workers.\"\n\n    At the same time, the school also proposed to ensure the Great Production Campaign in May and play a leading role in the Great Production Campaign. This touched him deeply, and he decided to transform himself, work hard on production when he returned, and strive to become a model.\n\n    As soon as he came back, he stopped asking the workers to carry him and participated in production himself. He also automatically returned the fire fee that he had misappropriated. This influenced the other cadres. Seeing that he was different from before, everyone supported him. During the branch re-election, he was elected as the director of the fourth joint branch. He was a \"white collar\" and afraid that others would look down on him, thinking he couldn't push. Therefore, he decided to unite with the workers, humbly learn from the \"black collars,\" and lead everyone to work. First, he talked to the cadres individually: \"To respond to the company's call and do a good job in the Great Production Campaign in May, the cadres must play a model role, participate in labor, and not ask the workers to carry them in order to make everyone have the energy to work.\" Then he held a cadres' meeting to review and deploy the Great Production Campaign in Red May. They reviewed that the main reasons for the poor production in the past were: First, the cadres were irresponsible and did not participate in labor themselves, only asking the workers to carry them, which greatly affected the workers' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, it was decided that all cadres should participate in labor and not allow carrying. Second, the labor allocation was inappropriate, and a lot of manpower was wasted in many places, such as the hauling of coal baskets. In the past, they were not distributed according to needs, with as many people hauling as needed. Therefore, they decided to allocate them according to the labor intensity of coal mining and the distance. For example, for distances as far as sixty or seventy meters, strong laborers could be equipped with one and a half coal baskets per person. For distances as close as twenty or thirty meters, two people could be equipped with one basket. The loading of the carts originally required two people, plus one person to handle the dustpan. They studied the possibility of pouring the coal baskets directly into the carts without using the dustpan, which would save one person to mine coal. Originally, there were three people pushing the carts. It was decided to have the pusher coordinate well with the cart carrier and the hooker to reduce one pusher and increase coal production. After this opinion was conveyed to all members of the joint branch, everyone was enthusiastic after seeing that the cadres did not ask to be carried and were willing to work in the same way, and they unanimously passed the plan and discipline for the Great Production Campaign in May: \"Everyone must improve, and anyone who slacks off will be fined one day's work. The coal miners, coal haulers, loaders, and pushers must all ensure the coal is extracted.\"\n\n    Some people in the third branch still held the old idea that \"whether you move or not, you still earn the same two coins.\" At the same time, they were afraid of change. Some were afraid that if production was increased, the Eighth Route Army would keep asking for that much and not lower it, and they would suffer. This thinking hindered production. Zhang Jinsheng seized on this harmful idea and timely explained and persuaded everyone. He used the workers' own eyes on the Ping-Han Campaign as an analogy to make everyone believe in the strength of the Eighth Route Army and the people, that the situation would only get better, not worse. He also contrasted the lives of workers under the rule of the Kuomintang and the enemy with the lives of workers in the liberated areas now. In the past, they were beaten and scolded every day, and they couldn't even eat their fill of soybean cakes. Now, they eat white flour every day, showing that the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government truly work for the people and for the interests of the working class. If the Kuomintang comes to attack, we can only work harder to help the army defend the liberated areas, which is also defending ourselves. In this way, he eliminated doubts and boosted everyone's enthusiasm for production. Later, it was discovered that the person spreading such bad words was You Junde, who was secretly working hard at coal mining, and his output was much higher than in April. Zhang Jinsheng asked him well, and he said, \"I was afraid that others would mine too much, and I wouldn't become a model, so I wanted others to mine less!\" Zhang Jinsheng immediately told him: \"If everyone produces more coal, the company earns money, and everyone's lives will improve. If everyone produces less coal, the company loses money, and everyone will have no food to eat. If everyone is doing badly, one person can't do well. What good is it for you to produce a few more tons of coal alone?!\" In this way, he cleared You Junde's thinking and made everyone's production enthusiasm fiery.\n\n    But then he encountered another unpleasant incident: Cao Luo, the production committee member who had been voted out, had not yet changed his mind. He didn't want to work himself, and he wasn't willing to participate in coal mining. He was always lazy and sleeping, affecting others. Zhang Jinsheng talked to him and criticized him, but he ignored him. Finally, he held a branch meeting to review, and everyone said, \"According to the discipline, fine him one day's work.\" But Zhang Jinsheng disagreed. He believed that to encourage labor, there should only be \"more work, more pay, less work, less pay.\" He tried his best to persuade everyone that as long as he accepted his mistakes and changed, that would be enough. In the future, it should be implemented that whoever works more gets more, and whoever works less gets less. From this, he came up with the method of scoring labor every day.\n\n    Every shift records the amount of coal mined by each miner, as well as the performance of hauling coal baskets, pushing carts, and the carpenter using wood. It is settled every half month, and the wages are combined and scored according to the average amount of coal produced by each person. In this way, everyone is willing to produce more coal and get more points and wages. No one wants to slack off and delay coal production, and everyone supervises each other, which invisibly improves the enthusiasm for production competition.\n\n    Zhang Jinsheng goes down to the pit half an hour early every day to check the location, allocate labor, and supervise at any time. He also directly leads the third branch and participates in labor himself. Although he is a \"white collar,\" he mines one to one and a half carts every day, no less than the average \"black collar,\" and he goes to work wherever there is a shortage of people. Half an hour before the end of work, he tells the coal miners to repair the mined tunnels in preparation for handing over the shift. When work is over, he gathers everyone together below to calculate the scores. First, he calculates how much coal has been loaded (one cart per ton), then the coal baskets, and then the coal miners, to get the total amount of coal produced, and then goes up to the wellhead to reconcile the accounts.\n\n    Because Zhang Jinsheng changed his own mind, promoted the transformation of general cadres, appropriately organized labor, created a scoring method, improved production enthusiasm, grasped and solved the ideological problems of the masses, and completed the Great Production Campaign in May, he was elected as a special-class labor model at the Heroes Conference of the entire Limin mining area in June. The fourth joint branch he led became the model joint branch of Tongshun Well.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 劳动模范张金生——利民煤矿通讯\n刘昭\n1946-08-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　劳动模范张金生\n    ——利民煤矿通讯\n    刘昭\n    煤黑的长方脸上长着络腮胡子，四十来岁，高个儿的张金生，四月前是利民煤矿公司通顺井矿工第四联合支部的生活委员，那时候，四联支是很不好的支部，除了管理员（旧的包工头）外，当干部的工会主任、生产委员、大鼓篓（拉煤篓的小头），以及当生活委员的他自己，受资产阶级传染的剥削意识，还残留在他们脑子里作怪，自己不想动，不参加生产，还要工人给他们抬工，当寄生虫，因此对劳力的组织分配和工友的生活不关心，下坑去只是游逛游逛，唔叫唔叫就完了。照生产委员的话，他们的脑子是扭着一股筋“出多出少我劈一个鸡腿，还怕没有我一份？”张金生虽然曾在老解放区武乡的墨灯煤窑里干过，多少知道点剥削人有些不对，但总觉得工人给当领头的抬工是古来的规矩，跟着走就得了；而且不动弹，吃别人，心里也是乐意的。干部是这样，下面工友们背工太大，心里不痛快，干活没劲头，都消极怠工起来。小鼓篓说：“你不想动弹，谁还想动弹？背这样多工，咱背不起，咱赚少了，他也多不了”，有时故意把鼓篓弄坏，要大鼓篓给他修理，他好在一旁偷偷懒。\n    刨镢看的到煤硬便不想刨，有时故意在硬煤上乱掘，一两下把镐尖给你搞断了，这就好：“你歇着，咱也歇歇吧！”\n    推罐的没罐也歇着不去找，你唔叫他，他上去找罐就不再下来。\n    因此在四月份出炭和工资都远远的落在别的支部后面。\n    四月头上，工会因为准备红五月大生产，开办了训练班。张金生也被调去受训，学习了十多天，张金生回来就换了一个新脑筋。他明白了工人农人受穷受苦是旧社会的制度不好，有地主资本家的压迫和剥削，他再不相信什么“穷富由命，有命就有福”，他完全赞成：“劳动才有饭吃，不劳动就没饭吃”，特别是职工会多主任的讲话提醒了他：“毛主席的口号是‘为群众服务’，工会就是为工人服务的，要给工人当勤务员”。\n    同时，学校还提出要保证五月大生产，在大生产中起领头作用，这很打动了他，他决心转变，回来好好搞生产，争取模范。\n    他一回来就不教工人抬工，自己下窑参加生产，还把分吞的火夫费，自动退出来，这影响到其它的干部。大家看到他和以前不同了，都赞成他，在分会改选时，他被选为第四联合支部的主任。他是个“白脖”怕别人瞧不起，推不动，于是决心团结工友，向“黑脖”虚心学习，领着大家干。首先他找干部个别谈：“要响应公司号召，把五月大生产搞好，干部就得起模范作用，参加劳动，不教工人抬工，才能使大伙有劲头干活”，然后开干部会来检讨布置红五月的大生产。他们检讨出：过去生产搞不好的原因主要的是：第一、干部不负责任，不亲自参加劳动，只教工人抬工，大大地影响了工友们的生产热忱；于是决定干部全体参加劳动，不许抬工。第二、劳动配备不适当，好多地方浪费了劳力，如像拉鼓篓的以前不按需要分配，下几个就拉几个；于是他们决定要按刨煤的劳动强度和距离远近来分配，如像远到六七十米达，劳动力强的就可以一个＠配上一个到一个半鼓篓；近到二三十米达的，两个＠配一个鼓篓就行了。装罐的原来是两个人，还有一个拨落簸箕的；他们研究出可以将拉煤的鼓篓直接向罐里倒，不用簸箕，就可以节省一人去创煤，推罐的原来三人，决定让推罐带罐与登钩的很好联系互助，减少一个推罐的去刨＠，增加出煤，这个意见传给了全联支的成员之后，大家看到干部不教抬工，要一样劳动，还提出了好办法，都热烈赞成，并一致通过了五月大生产的计划和纪律：“大家都要变好，谁要偷懒，罚一个工，刨＠的刨多少，拉鼓篓，装推罐的保证都要拉出来。”\n    三支部有些人还抱着，“动弹不动弹还不是一样的赚你这两个钱”的旧脑筋，同时，还怕变天，有些怕提高了生产，八路军就一直向你要这样多，降不下来，自己吃亏，这思想障碍了生产。张金生抓紧这种有害的想法，及时向大家解释说服，拿工人亲眼看到的平汉战役来比喻，让大家相信八路军和人民的力量，天只有变好，不会变坏，又把国民党与敌人统治时的工人生活和解放区工人现在的生活来对比，以前每天挨打挨骂，吃豆饼吃不饱，现在每天吃白面，说明共产党八路军与民主政府真正是一切为着人民，也为着工人阶级谋利益，国民党要来进攻，我们只有更努力生产来帮助军队保卫解放区，也就是保卫自己。这样才消除怀疑鼓起了大家的生产热情。以后发现说这样坏话的正是背地努力刨煤，产量比四月份增高很多的犹俊德。张金生很好地问他，他才说：“怕别人刨多了自己当不成模范，所以我要别人少刨！”张金生马上告诉他：“大家出煤多，公司赚了钱，大家生活改善才有办法；大家出煤少，公司赔了本，大家也会没饭吃，大家坏了，一人好不了，光你一人多出几吨煤顶啥用！？”这样打通了犹俊德的思想，把大家的生产情绪也搞得火热起来。\n    可是又遇到了一件不顺当的事：被选掉了的生产委员曹珞脑筋还没转过来，要自己劳动，心里不愿意，参加刨＠，总是不好好刨，偷懒睡睡觉，影响别人，张金生和他谈，批评他，都不理会，最后开支部大会检讨，大家说：“按照纪律，罚他一个工”。但是张金生不同意，他认为，要鼓励劳动只有“多劳多得，少劳少得”，他尽力说服大家，只要他接受错误转变就行了。今后应该实行谁劳动得多多得，谁劳动得少少得，从这里他就想出了每天按劳动记分的办法。\n    每一班都记上各个老＠的创煤数，以及拉鼓篓，推罐和木匠使木头的成绩，每半月结算一次，按每个人出煤的平均数计分合工资，这样谁也愿意多出煤，多得分，多得工资，谁偷懒耽误了出煤，大伙儿都不愿意，互相督促，无形中就提高了生产竞赛的热忱。\n    张金生每天早半点下坑看地点，分配劳力，随时检查督促，还直接领导三支部，亲自参加劳动。他虽是个“白脖”但他每天刨一罐到一罐半，并不比一般“黑脖”少，还要那儿紧缺人，就那儿干，到收工前半点就告刨＠的修好刨的坑道，准备交班，收工时就在下面集合大家在一起算分，先算装罐多少（一罐一吨），后算鼓篓，再算刨＠的，得出出煤总数，上来再到井口对赈。\n    因为张金生自己换了脑筋，推动了一般干部的转变，适当的组织了劳动，创造了记分的办法，提高了生产热情，掌握与解决了群众的思想问题，完成了五月大生产任务，六月在利民全矿区的群英大会上被选为特等劳动模范，他领导的第四联合支部成了通顺井的模范联合支部。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 3rd: Comprehensive news: The Kuomintang authorities have recently intensified the collection of actual grain and extortion of military grain in Sichuan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Shaanxi provinces to meet the urgent needs of the civil war. In Sichuan, regardless of the protests of the people of the province, Chiang Kai-shek insisted on implementing the collection of actual grain, demanding 10.35 million shi (a unit of dry measure) of grain from the people of Sichuan, of which the Kuomintang central government was stipulated to receive 5.85 million shi. Due to this harsh policy, in addition to the Sichuan Provincial Assembly and the county assemblies repeatedly sending telegrams of opposition since May, the China Economic Development Association held a symposium on July 12, believing that the authorities' breach of faith would starve the poor people suffering from disaster and famine. In Anhui, despite the Anhui Provincial Assembly sending a petition to Beijing in opposition, the authorities still decided to collect 4.4 million shi of grain in the province. In Tianjin and Beijing, the collection of actual grain, borrowing, and even the assigned collection of public grain are all based on wheat as the standard, which is one to two times more expensive than miscellaneous grains. Moreover, it has been a month since the wheat harvest, and there is very little wheat in storage. Forcing the collection of wheat is met with opposition from the people who are unprepared. The Jiangxi Provincial Kuomintang authorities' collection of \"surplus grain\" has not eased up even after the tragic death of the former director of the Land and Grain Department, Cheng Maoxing, who was forced to death. According to a person in charge of the Land and Grain Department: 250,000 shi have already been \"purchased,\" and 300,000 shi are still needed. The provincial government authorities ordered all grain administration personnel to go to various places to urge the collection. Due to transportation difficulties, even requisitioning fishing boats from Poyang Lake and other places cannot meet the urgent needs. Therefore, civilian labor is forcibly requisitioned. Now, in the Xinjiang, Ganjiang, and Raohe areas, all the people have been mobilized to undertake transportation, and several people die of starvation by the roadside every day. As a result, in more than ten counties including Ande, more than 75% of the fields are barren, and the disaster victims are using tree bark, grass roots, and wild vegetables to fill their hunger. Because the area for seedling transplantation is only one-third of last year, it is estimated that the autumn harvest is already unthinkable. In Shaanxi, in early June, wheat disasters occurred in more than ten counties including Xianyang, Wugong, Huayin, @ County, E County, Taiyang, Shang County, Jingyang, Zhen'an, Zhashui, Yaoxian, Fuping, and Shiquan; the average harvest was only 30-40%, but the provincial government still ordered the county magistrates and deputy directors of the Land and Grain Department to go to the countryside to accelerate the collection of accumulated land taxes, requiring them to be collected within 20 days.\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 3rd: Guilin News: A wave of rice looting has been universally triggered in various parts of Guangxi. Military vehicles sent to Yishan, Nandan, Hechi and other places to buy rice, even though they were carrying armed escorts of military police, were often looted by hungry people at the sound of a whistle. The reason is that the disaster in Guangxi is serious, and the price of rice has broken the 100,000 yuan mark, which is the highest record in the country. It is extremely difficult for ordinary people to maintain their lives even with tree bark and grass roots. Not only can they not see relief agencies such as the Relief Administration, but it is reported that even the Guilin merchants once jointly requested a loan of 10 million yuan from the Farmers Bank to go to Guizhou to purchase rice and provide relief to Guilin, but this was rejected by the provincial government authorities. Many local people are taking risks.\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 3rd: Shanghai Wenhui Daily published on July 13: According to a person from Dushan, Guizhou, regarding the victory of the local people in resisting the Kuomintang army, a Kuomintang army artillery battalion passed through Dushan in 17 cars and violently beat the ordinary people when buying rice in the city. At that time, it aroused the resistance of more than a thousand people who were at the market, and the sound of shouting and beating shook the whole city. Even the police said: \"It is unacceptable for the army to beat the ordinary people arbitrarily.\" The perpetrators immediately fled into the car, and more than a thousand people surrounded the car, including some people holding hand grenades. Seeing this, the county magistrate of the county urgently negotiated with the battalion commander, handed over the perpetrators to the county for punishment, and the battalion commander apologized to the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 勒索内战军粮急如星火  国民党区人民倒悬  广西粮价飞腾老百姓多挺而走险\n\n1946-08-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　勒索内战军粮急如星火\n    国民党区人民倒悬\n    广西粮价飞腾老百姓多挺而走险\n    【新华社延安三日电】综合消息：国民党当局近在川皖赣冀陕各省加紧征实及勒索军粮，以应内战急需。在四川，蒋介石不顾该省人民的抗议，坚持实行征实，向川省人民索取粮食一千零三十五万市石，其中规定国民党中央政府得五百八十五万市石。由于这一苛政，除四川省参议会及各县参议会五月以来即纷纷一再通电反对外，中国经济事业协进会并于七月十二日举行座谈会，认为当局这一失信行动，势将饿死灾荒下贫苦老百姓。在安徽，虽经皖省参议会赴京请愿反对，当局仍定在该省征粮四百四十万石。在平津，征实征借，以至带征公粮等，一律以小麦为标准，比缴杂粮贵一倍至二倍，且收麦已过一月，存麦无几，强迫征麦，人民没有准备，莫不反对。江西省国民党当局征收“余粮”，并不因前任田粮处长程懋型氏惨遭逼死而稍趋缓和。据田粮处某负责人谈：已“采购”二十五万石，尚差三十万石，省府当局令粮政全体人员分赴各地全力督促。由于运输困难，征用鄱阳湖等地渔船犹不能应付急需，遂强征民力，现信江、赣江、饶河一带，人民悉数被调担任运输，饿死路旁者日有数起，因此安德等十余县，田地荒芜现已有百分之七十五以上、灾民以树皮草根野菜充饥，因抽苗之地仅及去年三分之一，预计秋收已不堪设想。在陕西，六月初旬，咸阳、武功、华阴、＠县、鄂县、邰阳、商县、泾阳、镇安、柞水、耀县、富平、石泉等十多县发生麦灾；平均收成只三四成，但省政府仍令各县县长及田粮副处长下乡加紧督征，积欠田赋，限二十日内征齐。\n    【新华社延安三日电】桂林讯：广西各地普遍激起抢米的怒潮，派往宜山、南丹、河池等地买米的军车，虽然车上坐有武装押运的宪兵，也常被饥民在一声呼哨下抢了去。缘广西灾荒严重，米价竟突破十万元大关，为全国最高纪录。老百姓连以树皮草根来维持生命也极感困难，不但见不到救济分署之类的救济机关，据闻连桂林商民曾联名呈请向农民银行借一千万万元赴黔购米来桂救济，亦遭省政当局拒绝。许多地方民众，乃挺而走险。\n    【新华社延安三日电】沪文汇报七月十三日载：据贵州独山来人谈及目击该地人民反抗国民党军获得胜利之经过，国民党军炮兵营乘十七辆汽车，路过独山，在该城买米竟凶殴老百姓，当时激起赶集的人民千余人反抗，喊打之声震动全城，连警察也说：“军队任意打老百姓这不得了”。肇事者即逃匿车内，千余人民将该车包围，其中并有持手榴弹的人民。该县县长见状，急向营长交涉，将肇事者交县惩办，并由营长向人民道歉。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. The key points of the draft peace treaties regarding Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland from the Foreign Ministers' Meeting have been published as follows:\n\n    Draft Peace Treaty with Italy\n\n    Regarding the borders between Italy and Trieste, it is stipulated that Italy should cede to Yugoslavia all territories east of the French-proposed line, as well as several islands in the Trieste region of the Adriatic coast. The Free Territory of Trieste should continue within the Italian borders of the French-proposed line (note: incomplete here). France will obtain five small pieces of territory currently within Italy along the French-Italian border; however, Italy can obtain access to hydroelectric plants in the Alps region it lost. Italy must cede all sovereignty over the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, and it is stipulated that these islands must remain demilitarized forever. The transfer of the islands will be determined by the Anglo-Greek Agreement. British troops on the islands will withdraw within ninety days after the treaty comes into effect.\n\n    Italy relinquishes all rights to its African possessions (including Libya, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland). These possessions should temporarily maintain their original status until the four powers jointly make a final decision. Italy respects the sovereignty of Albania and Abyssinia and renounces its special interests or influence in both countries. Italy relinquishes all its interests and privileges in China under the 1901 Peking Treaty, and it is stipulated that Italy abolishes the treaty of the Italian concession in Tianjin and renounces its rights in the Shanghai and Xiamen International Settlements. Italy must deliver goods worth 100 million US dollars to the Soviet Union within six years, but existing industrial production can be delivered in the first two years. The treaty includes notes on the compensation claims of France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania, and Abyssinia, which will be considered by the peace conference currently held in Paris. The treaty stipulates that the quantity and type of compensation goods must be limited by the Italo-Soviet agreement. The method of selection should be based on the principle of not hindering Italy's economic reconstruction and avoiding increasing debts to other countries.\n\n    The size of the Italian army is limited to 185,000 men, and the gendarmerie to 65,000 men. The Italian navy should be 67,500 tons, plus the old battleships Doria and Duilio. Submarines are not allowed. The air force is limited to 200 fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and 150 transport and training aircraft. Before Italy concludes a commercial treaty or agreement with the United Nations, it should grant each United Nation the following treatment for eighteen months after the establishment of the peace treaty, and each United Nation should also grant Italy reciprocal treatment. That is, regarding tariffs on imports and exports and domestic taxation on imported goods, Italy should grant each United Nation unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. In all other respects, Italy shall not discriminate against the entry or exit of goods from any territory of any United Nation compared to other United Nations or other foreign countries. Nationals of any United Nation should be granted national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment.\n\n    Draft Peace Treaty with Romania\n\n    The borders of Romania should be based on the borders as of January 1, 1941. The Romanian-Hungarian border as of January 1, 1938, should be restored. The Soviet-Romanian border should be determined according to the Soviet-Romanian agreement of June 28, 1940, and the Soviet-Czech agreement of August 29, 1945. In accordance with the armistice agreement, Romania has taken measures to release all people imprisoned due to engaging in activities supporting the United Nations or sympathizing with the United Nations or for other racial reasons, regardless of nationality or ethnicity, and to abolish all discriminatory laws, ensure the completion of these measures, and refrain from taking any similar actions in the future. Like Italy, Romania should also guarantee to capture those accused of wartime treason or collaboration with the enemy and should provide evidence. Romania guarantees to recognize the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, as well as the agreements or measures reached in the past and future with Germany, Austria, and Japan to restore peace, which have full effect. The maintenance of land, sea, and air force armaments and defenses should be strictly limited to addressing domestic incidents and border defense tasks. Romania may have an army with a total strength of 120,000 men (including border guards), and 5,000 anti-aircraft guns and cannons. The navy is allowed 5,000 men, and warships are allowed 15,000 tons. The air force (including the air force belonging to the navy) is allowed 150 aircraft, with a total of 8,000 personnel. Romania must not possess or acquire aircraft whose design is primarily for bombing. All Allied forces should withdraw from Romania within ninety days after the treaty comes into effect, but the Soviet Union has the right to retain part of its troops in Romanian territory to maintain the transportation lines of the Red Army in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria. Due to Romania's military actions and the damage suffered by the Soviet Union due to the Romanian occupation of Soviet territory, Romania should pay compensation. However, in view of Romania's war against Germany, it is agreed to make only partial compensation, that is, reparations of 300 million US dollars, to be paid off in eight years.\n\n    Draft Peace Treaty with Bulgaria\n\n    The borders of Bulgaria should be based on its borders as of January 1, 1941. The part of this document concerning the Greek-Bulgarian border is temporary until Greece submits its opinions to the peace conference or the Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Bulgaria may have an army with a total of 55,000 men (including border guards), 1,800 anti-aircraft guns, and 7,250 tons of warships. The air force (including naval aircraft) may have 90 aircraft, of which no more than 70 should be fighter-type aircraft, and the air force personnel should be 5,200. Bulgaria must not possess aircraft whose design is primarily for bombing. The damages suffered by Yugoslavia and Greece will be compensated by Bulgaria, but in view of Bulgaria's war against Germany, only partial compensation will be made.\n\n    Draft Peace Treaty with Hungary\n\n    The borders of Hungary with Austria and Yugoslavia should be based on the borders as of January 1, 1938. The Vienna Decision of August 30, 1940, is declared null and void, and the Hungarian-Romanian border of January 1, 1938, is restored. The border between Hungary and the Soviet Union, starting from the common intersection point of the two countries and Czechoslovakia, is established along the former Hungarian-Czech border of January 1, 1938. Hungary may have an army (including border guards and inland river fleet personnel) with a total of 65,000 men, and an air force of 90 aircraft, of which no more than 70 should be combat aircraft, and an air force personnel of 5,000. Hungary must not have aircraft designed primarily for bombing. The damages it caused to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia will be compensated by Hungary, but in view of Hungary's war against Germany, only partial compensation will be made, that is, reparations of 300 million US dollars, of which two-thirds goes to the Soviet Union.\n\n    Draft Peace Treaty with Finland\n\n    The borders of Finland should be based on its borders as of January 1, 1941, except that Finland recognizes the return of the Petsamo province to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union recognizes the relinquishment of its right to lease the Hanko Peninsula as stipulated in the Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty of March 22, 1940. Finland recognizes the Soviet Union's right to use territory and territorial waters in the Porkkala-Udd area to establish a Soviet naval base for a term of 50 years, with an annual rent of 5 million Finnish marks. Finland may have an army of 34,400 men, a navy of 4,500 men, warships of 10,000 tons, and an air force (including naval aircraft) of 60 aircraft, with a total personnel of 3,000. Finland must not have aircraft designed primarily for bombing. The damages caused to the Soviet Union should be compensated by Finland, but in view of Finland's declaration of war against Germany and its assistance in expelling German troops from Finland, only partial compensation will be made, that is, compensation totaling 300 million US dollars, to be paid in goods over eight years. Finland recognizes the Soviet Union's right to confiscate all German property within Finnish territory, to be transferred to the Soviet Union by the German Property Control Committee.\n\n    All treaties contain the following clauses: the countries concerned will guarantee that all people under their jurisdiction, regardless of race, gender, language, or religion, enjoy human rights and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, publication, religious belief, political belief, and assembly.\n\n    All treaties have provisions stipulating that within eighteen months after the treaty comes into effect, the ambassadors, ministers, or heads of missions of the relevant powers will represent the Allied and United Nations to manage all matters concerning the implementation and interpretation of the treaty.\n\n    All treaties include provisions similar to Article 13 of the Peace Treaty with Italy, namely regarding the handling of war criminals and supporters of fascism, the demobilization of troops exceeding the recognized military strength, the control of standing and war materials, and general economic clauses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四国外长会议关于意罗保匈芬五国和约草案要点\n\n1946-08-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　四国外长会议关于意罗保匈芬五国和约草案要点\n    【新华社延安三日电】外长会议关于意罗保匈芬五国的和约草案已经公布，其要点如下：\n    对意和约草案\n    意大利与的里雅斯特之疆界，规定意大利应将法国建议线以东之一切领土，以及亚德里亚海岸的里雅斯特区域中之若干岛屿割让予南斯拉夫，的里雅斯特自由区则赓续在法国建议线的意疆界以内（按此处不全），法国将获得法意边境现在意大利境内之领土五小块，然意大利可获得通往其丧失之阿尔比斯区域中水电厂之通路，意大利须将多得喀尼斯群岛之全部主权割让予希腊，并规定此等岛屿必须永远为非军事地区。群岛之移让事宜，将由英希协定决定之。该岛英军于条约生效后之九十天内撤退。\n    意大利放弃全非洲属地（包括里比亚厄、立特里亚及意属索马利兰）之一切权利。此等属地应暂时维持原状，直至四强联合作成最后之决定为止。意大利尊重阿尔巴尼亚与阿比西尼亚两国之主权，并放弃其在两国内之特别利益或势力。意大利放弃根据一九○一年北京条约在中国所享之一切利益与特权，并规定意大利废除天津意大利租界条约，并放弃上海与厦门公共租界内之权利。意大利须在六年内以其价值一亿美元之物资交付苏联，但现有工业生产在最初两年内可以交付。条约内附注法国、南斯拉夫、希腊、阿尔巴尼亚及阿比西尼亚之赔偿要求，将由现在巴黎举行之和平会议加以考虑。条约规定赔偿物资之数量与种类，须受意苏协定之限制其选择之方法，以不妨碍意大利之经济重建及避免对其他国家之增加负债为原则。\n    限制意大利之陆军为十八万五千人，宪兵六万五千人。意海军应为六万七千五百吨，另有旧战斗舰多里亚号及杜里奥号，不许拥有潜艇。空军限于战斗机、侦察机二百架，运输机及教练机一五○架。意大利在未与联合国缔结商约或协定前，在和约成立以后之十八个月中，应予各联合国以下之待遇，而各联合国亦予意大利以互惠之待遇，即对进出口之关税及对进口货物之国内课税，意大利应予各联合国以无条件之最惠国待遇。在其他一切方面，意大利对任何联合国任何领土货物之进出，均不得较之对其他联合国或其他外国擅作歧视之待遇。对任何联合国之国民，均应予以本国国民之待遇及最惠国之待遇。\n    对罗和约草案\n    对罗尼亚之疆界，应以一九四一年一月一日时之疆界为标准，唯一九三八年一月一日时之罗匈疆界，应予以恢复，苏罗疆界应根据一九四○年六月二十八日的苏罗协定及一九四五年八月二十九日的苏捷协定规定之。遵照休战协定，罗马尼亚已采取措施，不分国籍与种族，释放一切由于从事赞成联合国的活动或同情联合国或因其他种族原因而被囚禁的人民，并废除一切歧视之法律，保证完成这措施，并在今后不再采取任何类似的行动。罗巴尼亚亦应如意大利，应保证捉拿被控为战时叛国或通敌者，并应提供证据。罗马尼亚保证承认对意、匈、保、芬的和约，以及为恢复和平在过去和今后与德国、奥地利、日本所达到之协议或措置，具有完全的效力。陆海空军军备与防务之维持，应严格限于应付国内之事件与边境防卫的任务。罗马尼亚得有一支总兵力十二万人的陆军（包括边防军），五千门高射炮及大炮。海军准许有五千人，军舰吨位准许有一万五千吨。空军（包括海军所属之空军）准有一百五十架飞机，总人数八千名。罗马尼亚不得拥有或取得其设计偏重轰炸机型式的飞机。所有盟军均应于条约生效后九十天以内撤离罗马尼亚，唯苏联有权保留一部分军队在罗马尼亚领土，以维持奥地利苏联占领区红军之交通线。由于罗马尼亚军事行动及罗国占领苏联领土使苏联遭受的损失；均应由罗马尼亚赔偿，但鉴于罗马尼亚曾对德作战，故同意只作部分赔偿，即赔款三万万美金，在八年内付清。\n    对保和约草案\n    保加利亚之疆界，应依其一九四一年一月一日之疆界为标准。本文有关希保边界部分，在希保将其意见向和会或外长会议提出前，系属暂时性质。保加利亚得有一支总数五万五千人的陆军（包括边防军），一千八百门高射炮，七千二百五十吨军舰。空军（包括海军飞机在内）得有飞机九十架，其中战斗型式之飞机不得超过七十架，空军人员为五千二百人。保加利亚不得拥有其设计偏重轰炸机型式的飞机。南斯拉夫与希腊所蒙受之损失，将由保加利亚赔偿，但鉴于保加利亚曾经对德作战，故将仅作部分赔偿。\n    对匈和约草案\n    匈牙利与奥地利及南斯拉夫之疆界，应以一九三八年一月一日之疆界为标准。一九四○年八月三十日之维也纳决议宣布作废，一九三八年一月一日匈罗边界仍予恢复，匈牙利与苏联之疆界自该二国及捷克斯拉夫的共同交界点起，沿一九三八年一月一日之前之匈捷边界确立之。匈牙利得有一支陆军（包括边防军与内河舰队人员），总数六万五千人，得有九十架飞机的空军，其中作战飞机不得超过七十架，空军人员五千人。匈牙利不得有其设计以轰炸为主之飞机。其对苏联、捷克斯拉夫与南斯拉夫所造成的损失，将由匈牙利赔偿，但鉴于匈牙利曾对德作战，将只作部分赔偿，即赔款三万万美金，其中苏联得三分之二。\n    对芬和约草案\n    芬兰之疆界应以其在一九四一年一月一日之疆界为标准，唯芬兰承认归还苏联之贝柴摩省在外。苏联承认放弃其于一九四○年三月二十二日苏芬和约中所规定之租借汉科半岛权利，芬兰承认了苏联在波兰卡拉——乌德地区使用领土与领海建立苏联海军基地，期限五十年，每年租金五百万芬兰马克。芬兰得有总额三万四千四百人之陆军，四千五百人海军，军舰一万吨，空军（包括海军飞机在内）有飞机六十架，总人数为三千人。芬兰不得有其设计以轰炸为主之飞机。对苏联造成之损失应由芬兰赔偿，但鉴于芬兰曾对德宣战，并协助驱逐德军出芬兰，故将只作部分赔偿，即赔偿总额为三万万美金，分八年以货物付清。芬兰承认苏联有权没收芬境一切德国财产，由德境管制委员会移交苏联。\n    所有和约，均包含下列条款，有关国家将保证在其管辖下的一切人民不因种族、性别、语言或宗教之区别，得享有人权与各基本自由，包括言论、出版、宗教信仰、政治信仰与集会自由。\n    所有和约，均有条文规定，在条约生效后十八个月以内，有关各强国之大使、公使或使团团长，将代表盟国与联合国管理一切关于条约之执行与解释事宜。\n    所有和约均包括类似对意和约第十三款的条文，即关于处理战犯与法西斯主义的支持者，解除超过被认可军额的军队，管制常备与战争原料及一般性质之经济条款。"

Polish representative Zymierski criticized those countries who, while claiming to emphasize the handling of the German question, were attempting to diminish the importance of the conference. He said, \"We lost six million people, and we understand the importance of the German question better than any other country, but the time to deal with this issue is not yet ripe.\" The head of the Abyssinian delegation, Akililu Habte-Wold, then spoke, emphasizing Abyssinia's territorial claims against Italy. Belarusian representative Kiselev, in his speech, disagreed with the proposal of the Four Powers that Italian colonies be temporarily occupied by Britain until a final decision is reached. He said, \"The continued occupation of any colony by Britain is interpreted by public opinion as Britain attempting to illegally influence these territories.\" At the plenary session on the 1st, Yugoslavian delegation leader Kardelj delivered a speech in which he praised the work of the Council of Foreign Ministers but disagreed with certain clauses of the draft peace treaty prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers, namely the decision regarding the fate of Trieste and the articles determining the Italo-Yugoslav border. The head of the Norwegian delegation, Lange, delivered a speech, pointing out the great work of the Council of Foreign Ministers and saying that the cooperation of the great powers is a guarantee of stable peace and security for the people of all countries.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: TASS reported: At the meeting of the Rules of Procedure Committee held on August 1st, Dutch representative Boetzelaer opposed Article 3 of the rules of procedure for the peace conference formulated by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which stipulated that it should only be composed of all countries that were at war with Germany. The Dutch representative argued that it should be composed of eleven countries. Molotov opposed the Dutch representative's proposal. In the vote, the Dutch representative's proposal was rejected, opposed by eleven countries. US representative Byrnes did not participate in the vote. The TASS reporter pointed out: The US representative's abstention from voting indicated doubt. A sentence often heard at the meeting was: Representatives believe that Byrnes would also indirectly support those who want to undermine the resolutions of the Council of Foreign Ministers, even though he participated when the Council of Foreign Ministers' resolutions were passed. At the morning meeting of the Rules Committee on the 2nd, Polish representative Giżycki requested that Poland have the right to vote in the committee participating in the formulation of the peace treaties with Italy and Hungary. Molotov supported Poland's request, but the representatives of the United States, Britain, Australia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand opposed it, and Poland withdrew its request. Subsequently, the representatives of New Zealand and the Netherlands put forward a motion to designate Bidault as the permanent chairman, but the Soviet Union insisted that the chairmanship be held by the Four Powers in rotation, changing every three days. The outcome of this dispute is unknown.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎和会第五天  各国代表继续发言\n\n1946-08-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎和会第五天\n    各国代表继续发言\n    【新华社延安三日电】各方报导：巴黎和会的第五天（二日），大会仍举行一般发言。波兰代表兹莫夫斯基抨击那些声言强调处理德国问题的国家，试图减弱和会的重要性，他说：“我们丧失六百万人民，我们比其他任何国家更了解德国问题的重要，但处理此问题的时间还没有成熟”。阿比西尼亚代表团长阿克利伦继起发言，强调阿国对意的领土要求。白俄罗斯代表基什列夫演说时，不同意四强下列的建议，即在达到最后决定之前，意大利殖民地暂时由英国占领。他说：“英国之继续占领任何殖民地，都被舆论解释为英国企图非法影响这些领土”。在一日的全体会议上，南斯拉夫代表团长卡德尔发表演说，他赞成外长会议的工作，但不同意外长会议准备的和约草案的某些条文，即关于的里亚斯特命运的决定，以及确定意南边界的条文。挪威代表团长兰吉发表演说，指出外长会议的巨大工作，并谓各列强合作是各国人民稳定和平与安全的保证。\n    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社报导：八月一日举行的程序规则委员会会议上，荷代表波次雷反对外长会议所制订之和会程序规则的第三条，该条规定只能由一切曾与德国处于战争状态的各国组成之，而荷代表则主张由十一国组成之，莫洛托夫反对荷代表提议。在表决时，荷代表的提议被否决，反对者由十一国，美代表贝纳斯未参加表决。塔斯社记者指出：美代表不参加表决，表示怀疑，会议上常听见这样的一句话：代表们认为贝纳斯也会间接拥护那些想破坏外长会议决议的人，但外长会议的决议在通过时是有他参加的。程委会二日晨的会议上，波代表著名钢吉琴家吉尔生，要求波兰在参加制定对意匈和约委员会中有表决权，莫洛托夫支持波兰的要求，但美、英、澳、荷、新西兰代表反对，波兰遂撤回其要求。其后新西兰、荷兰代表又提出一议案，指定比道尔为永久主席，但苏联坚持由四强轮流担任主席，三天一换。此争论结果不悉。"

    "date": "1946-08-06",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "[This dispatch comes from Changzhi] The production movement in Chuandi Village, Pingshun, is currently developing in depth. After the village cadres and masses clarified their thinking on getting rich, they then discussed \"how to get rich.\" The leadership summarized the typical example of Guo Yu'en's efforts to get rich through precise production planning, mobilized everyone to discuss it, and after clearing their minds, the villagers formulated prosperity plans from household to the entire village. Thus, the Chuandi production movement was launched in depth.\n\n　　Guo Yu'en was originally very poor. He only bought four mu and eight fen of land during the rent reduction in 1942. In 1943, he harvested eleven shi of grain including hillside land, but after paying off his debts, he had only five shi left, which was not enough to eat. Yu'en responded to the government's call to organize for production in order to survive the famine. He first organized a mutual aid team, tried to survive the famine, worked actively, the whole group opened up eighteen mu of wasteland, fertilized each mu with one hundred dan of manure, and cultivated and weeded twice. Under the encouragement of his group, the whole village was organized. Yu'en opened up five mu of wasteland through mutual aid, and harvested eighteen shi of grain in 1944, which was enough to eat. In 1945, he paid special attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation, harvesting twenty-eight shi of grain, and achieved \"cultivate two, reserve one.\" In these two years, he was selected as the second-ranked labor hero in the entire county. This year, in agriculture, he is implementing warm water seed soaking, fertilizing each mu with 101 dan of manure (and applying top dressing to two mu), plowing, harrowing, and weeding three times each, planted one mu of cotton and two and a half mu of Golden Queen corn. He plans to harvest thirty shi of grain, and after eating, have half left over. In sideline occupations, he wants to weave cloth for clothing self-sufficiency, plant five mu of medicinal materials, seven mu of tree seedlings, extensively raise cattle, pigs, chickens, and sheep, invest two thousand yuan in cooperative shares, and plans to buy a weaving machine. Yu'en became rich gradually through rent reduction and organized production, and through household planning. He himself became rich, and he tried his best to help the poor, winning the support of the entire village.\n\n　　The leadership helped Yu'en summarize his prosperity plan and methods, invited him to report at the people's school, and widely publicized and discussed it among the masses. People said: \"Yu'en is the best off in our village. He responded to the government's call, organized mutual aid, and became successful through deep plowing and careful cultivation.\" \"The old saying goes: eating doesn't make you poor, dressing doesn't make you poor, but without planning, you'll be poor for life. Yu'en's planning is good, he has plans every year, but we do whatever comes our way, we don't prepare early, and we delay everything.\" Finally, it was unanimously agreed that: to get rich, we must think of various ways to produce.\n\n　　When the masses had the need to accurately calculate their own family affairs, the cadres then specifically divided the work, determined the targets, and helped everyone to order them separately. Every household in the village made their plans, and the production direction of the entire village was also clarified. The village cadres then checked the village plan made in the first month according to these plans, looked at what had been done and what had not been done in agriculture, sideline occupations, and all aspects, and what were the reasons? Mobilized all households in the village to discuss how to ensure \"cultivate two, reserve one.\" Finally, with reference to the plans of each household, the village's plan was revised and reordered: in agriculture: 3,245 mu of hillside land, which can produce 1,000 bags of potatoes, 48,000 jin of vegetables, and 67 shi and 3 dou of miscellaneous grains; 683 mu of flat land, which can produce 1,475 shi and 6 dou of grain and 480 jin of cotton after top dressing. In sideline occupations, raising chickens can produce more than 24,000 eggs, raising silkworms can produce 18 jin of cocoons, spinning 1,495 jin of yarn, weaving 800 jin of cloth, plus beekeeping, weaving straw hats, mountain goods, and cooperative income can earn a total of 464,985 yuan. Including agricultural income, it is equivalent to 2,333 shi and 7 dou of grain (large dou). The village has 344 people, large and small, and needs a total of 1,559 shi of grain for food, clothing, expenses, public grain, public funds, and livestock feed. After deducting expenses, there is a net surplus of 774 shi and 8 dou. Together with the surplus grain next year, \"cultivate two, reserve one\" can be achieved.\n\n　　After revising the plan, the masses' production enthusiasm was extremely high, and they unanimously wanted to fight for \"cultivate two, reserve one.\" The mutual aid teams challenged each other, and after discussion by the masses, four conditions were created for Chuandi to be a model village: 1. Guarantee that the village plan is at least 80% completed. 2. Organize comprehensively, carry out comprehensive production, exceeding any previous year. 3.

If they were all one-yuan legal tender notes, then its measures would be as follows:\n    1. Length: If all the one-yuan banknotes were connected, they would be 60,000,000 kilometers long, enough to pave all the railways and highways in our country (highways calculated at 5 meters wide) into railways and highways paved with banknotes. If they were stacked up, they would be 400,000 kilometers high, requiring 13,333 airplanes to hold a relay ascending flight, and only the highest plane could exceed their height.\n    2. Volume: Every 500,000 yuan in banknotes occupies one cubic meter of space, so 600,000,000,000 yuan would occupy 1,200,000 cubic meters; to store them in a building, it would take thirteen large rooms to hold them.\n    3. Weight: At one kilogram per thousand yuan, the total weight is 600,000,000 kilograms. If the world's most heavily loaded four-ton trucks were used to transport them, it would take 133,333 trucks to move them all. If people were to carry them, it would take 13,333,333 young and strong people. (calculated at 45 kilograms per person)\n    Furthermore, if a single person were dedicated to counting the number of bills, it would take 317,091 years, and they would have to work non-stop 24 hours a day. If all the young bank employees in China (all young men around twenty years old), a total of 17,838 people, were mobilized to work eight hours a day (but during the extraordinary period of counting banknotes, of course, even commemorative days, holidays, and any vacations, sick leave... would all be waived), counting the banknotes one by one, by the time this amount was counted, these twenty thousand young men would all have become old men over sixty years old.\n    Not far from here, in Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi, the famine is now severe. The number of famine victims in Henan has increased from 8.2 million in May to over 14.2 million recently; the total number of disaster victims in Hunan Province has reached 30 million; Jiangxi has 13 million disaster victims; out of the 14 million people in Guangxi Province, 13 million have no food to eat! The Kuomintang reactionaries have not used a single yuan of their deposits in the United States to relieve these people who have endured eight years of war against Japan, let alone that, but now, on the contrary, they are stepping up the collection of grain and money in these areas, using the grain that the people have exchanged for selling their children to support the army fighting the civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 度量衡\n老田\n1946-08-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　度量衡\n    老田\n    如果把国民党反动派的几个头子存在美国银行的三万万美金提回来，共值法币六○○、○○○、○○○、○○○元（这里暂以每元美金折合国币二千元计，现在已不止这个数目）。倘若都是一元法币的话，那么它的度量衡是这样的：\n    一、度：将全部一元钞票连接起来，可长达六○、○○○、○○○公里，可以将我国所有的铁路和公路（公路以五公尺宽计算）都铺成钞票铺起来的铁路和公路。如果把它叠起来，可高达四○○、○○○公里，这样就需要一万三千三百三十三架飞机，举行接力升高飞行，到最高一架，才可以超过它们的高度呢。\n    二、量：每五○○、○○○元钞票可占一立方公尺的面积，六○○、○○○、○○○、○○○元则共占一、二○○、○○○立方公尺；要往大楼里装，要十三大间才可以装得下。\n    三、衡：以每千元一公斤计，全重是六○○、○○○、○○○公斤，假如用世界上最能载重的四吨载重汽车来运，要一三三、三三三辆车才能把它运走。倘若用人去担，那非要动员年轻力壮的一三、三三三，三三三人不行。（以每人能担九十斤算）\n    再呢，假如专门用一个人去点清他的数目，那么要花三一七、○九一年，而且还得每天不停的工作二十四小时。如果动员全中国各银行的青年行员（都是二十岁左右的年轻小伙子）共一七、八三八人，每日工作八小时（但当点数钞票的非常时期，当然连纪念日，例假以及什么休假，病假……也一概从免），一元一元的数去，等到点清这个数目时，这两万个年轻小伙子都已变成六十岁以上的老头儿了。\n    离我们这里不远的河南、江西、湖南、广西这些地方，如今灾荒正严重。河南的饥民数目，已经从五月间的八百二十万，增加到最近的一千四百二十多万；湖南全省灾民，到了三千万；江西灾民一千三百万；广西全省人口一千四百万当中，就有一千三百万人没有饭吃！国民党反动派没有动用一元在美国的存款，来救济这些抗战八年的老百姓，这且不讲，现在，反转在这些地方，加紧催粮催款，拿老百姓卖儿卖女换来的粮食，供养打内战的军队。"

    "content": "Protest Against Chiang's Aircraft Raids on Yan'an\n    *Liberation Daily* Commentary\n    Yesterday, Yan'an City suffered its first bombing and strafing by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft. The War of Resistance against Japan has been won for almost a year, and the Liberated Areas and the people of the whole country are earnestly hoping for peace. However, Chiang Kai-shek has brazenly sent aircraft to wreak havoc on Yan'an. Not only are people from all walks of life in Yan'an indignant, but the people of the whole country will become clearer and more vigilant about Chiang Kai-shek's acts of war.\n    Chiang's aircraft's attack on Yan'an is another ironclad proof of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a civil war. It exposes Chiang Kai-shek's various deceptive propaganda. Chiang Kai-shek once told Mr. Kui Yanfang and other representatives of the peace petition group that \"I will not even fight back if the Communists come to attack.\" Yan'an is the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the center of the Liberated Areas' peaceful and democratic construction. Why must Chiang Kai-shek adopt the same means as the Japanese to invade Yan'an? This proves that the dictator's lies must be understood from the opposite perspective. The actual content of \"political solution\" is \"military solution\"; the actual content of \"I will not even fight back if the Communists come to attack\" is \"Regardless of the Communist Party's continuous struggle for peace, I will still fight it.\" In his acts of launching a civil war, Chiang Kai-shek not only tried his best to deceive the Chinese people, but also tried every means to deceive foreigners. Currently, he has instructed his ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, to declare that \"there is no civil war in China.\" Today, while Chiang's troops are frantically attacking the Liberated Areas in the Central Plains, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, Chiang's aircraft are shamelessly bombing Yan'an, the \"center of democratic China\" (according to the American Far East expert, Bisheng). This is a signal that Chiang Kai-shek is more frantically carrying out a nationwide civil war, and it is also a shameless provocation to the entire Chinese peaceful and democratic movement. The people of the whole country and the world will see this fact more clearly. No matter how hard Chiang Kai-shek tries to deceive, the eyes and ears of the world cannot be blinded.\n    The people of Yan'an and the people of the Liberated Areas have grown stronger in the eight years of arduous War of Resistance and nearly a year of self-defense struggles against the reactionaries. The people of the Liberated Areas have full confidence in their own strength and the cause of national independence, peace, and democracy. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to use the eight American bombs that bombed Yan'an and all the aid that American imperialism gave him to scare the people of the Liberated Areas is simply a dream! The result of the bombing of Yan'an can only further increase our hatred for domestic fascist dictators and foreign armed interventionists.\n    The bombing of Yan'an is a satire on the so-called \"mediating role\" of the United States in China. While the Nanjing negotiations are intermittent, the planes given by the Americans are actually bombing and strafing the center of the CCP, one side being mediated. This event alone is enough to show how serious the extent of the US authorities' interference in China's internal affairs has developed! It is time for the American people to unite and stop this interference with practical actions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抗议蒋机袭延  解放日报时评\n\n1946-08-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　抗议蒋机袭延\n    解放日报时评\n    昨天延安市第一次遭受了蒋介石飞机的轰炸扫射。抗战胜利已将一年，解放区与全国人民莫不殷切希望和平，而蒋介石竟悍然派飞机来延安肆虐，不但延市各界人士愤懑万分，全国人民对蒋介石的内战暴行，也会更加清楚，更加警惕。\n    蒋机袭击延安，是蒋介石发动内战的又一铁证，它揭破了蒋介石的种种欺骗宣传，蒋介石曾对篑延芳先生等和平请愿团代表说过，“甚至共产党来打也不还手”。延安是中共中央所在地，是解放区人民和平民主建设的中心，为什么蒋介石必欲采取和日本人一样的手段来侵犯延安呢？这可证明对独裁者的鬼话，必须从反面去了解，“政治解决”的实际内容，就是“武力解决”；“甚至共产党来打也不还手”的实际内容，就是“不管共产党始终为和平奋斗，我还是要打它”。蒋介石在其发动内战的行径中，不仅尽力欺骗国人，而且千方百计欺骗外国人，目前他曾命驻美大使顾维钧氏宣称“中国没有内战”。今天在中原、苏皖、山东、山西、河北等地蒋军都在疯狂地向解放区进攻之时，蒋机竟无耻向“民主中国中心”（美远东专家毕生语）的延安滥施轰炸，这是蒋介石更疯狂地进行全国规模内战的信号，也就是对全中国和平民主运动的无耻挑衅，全国人民和全世界将更清楚地看清这一事实。不管蒋介石怎样费尽心计，天下人的耳目是无法蒙蔽的。\n    延安的人民和解放区的人民，是在八年艰苦抗战和将近一年来对反动派进行自卫斗争中壮大起来的，解放区人民对于自己的力量和全国人民独立和平民主事业，具有充分的信心。蒋介石想拿轰炸延安的八枚美国炸弹和美国帝国主义给他的全部援助来吓唬解放区人民，那简直是梦想！轰炸延安的结果，只能更加增加我们对国内法西斯独裁者的仇恨与外国武装干涉者的仇恨。\n    延安的被炸，是对美国在中国的所谓“调停地位”的一种讽刺，在南京谈判若断若续之时，美国人给的飞机竟在被调停的一方面——中共中心地区投弹扫射。只这一事件，就足以表现美国当局干涉中国内政的程度已发展到怎样严重的程度！美国人民一致起来制止这一干涉，是实际行动的时候了。"

After weeding the first and second crops, the people of She County and Wuxi (now merged with Wu'an) formed groups and went to the new Wu'an district to help with weeding, receiving a warm welcome from the local people. They said, \"It's still good under the leadership of the Eighth Route Army; who would have cared about this in the past!\" When the Fifth District of Wuxi merged with the Second District of Wu'an, the cadres of the new district asked the comrades of the old district to provide more help in their work. The comrades of the old district said, \"This is our duty. The new district lacks labor, and we will also help you with production.\" After returning, villages such as Hedi, Baiguan, Shierzhuang, and Tanling drew some militiamen and self-defense forces to help weed in villages such as Yuquanling, Shangbaishi, Xiabaishi, Yuanloubaishi, and Shangquan. They were divided into squads and platoons, led by buglers, with established discipline, and acted very consistently. They all weeded patiently and actively, and even slight carelessness would be criticized by the squad. The people of the new district also treated them with enthusiasm. In the past, workers lived in temples, but now they live in the homes of those they help. In the past, those who didn't work a full day because of rain were not given food or full wages, but today everyone eats the same, and the food is good. During breaks, they talked very intimately, with the masses of the old district talking about their experience of becoming rich through mutual aid in production, and the new district talking about their deeds of emancipation struggle. A team of fewer than a hundred people weeded more than one qing of land clean every day. When they left a week later, the villagers sent them off as if they were saying goodbye to relatives, sending them a long way and paying them wages. They refused, but the newly emancipated people felt bad and insisted on giving everyone between one hundred, two hundred, and three hundred yuan per day. An old self-defense team member told the reporter: \"This is different from those two years. In the past, we worked for the landlords, and it was terrible in the fields. Whoever went ahead would be hit with clods of earth, and whoever weeded deeply would be said to have 'silver underneath'? Now we are helping our newly emancipated people, and if we don't weed well, we feel bad.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武涉老区人民支援新区锄苗\n\n1946-08-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武涉老区人民支援新区锄苗\n    【本报讯】经八九年革命洗礼具有互助习惯的老解放区人民，发扬“劳动人民是一家”的互助精神，到新区支援生产。涉县、武西（已与武安合并）人民，于锄完头二遍苗后，便成群结队的开赴武安新区帮助锄苗，受到当地人民热烈欢迎。他们说：“还是八路军领导的好，过去谁管这事呢！”武西五区与武安二区合并时，新区干部要求老区同志在工作上多帮助，老区同志说：“这是我们的义务。新区劳力缺，我们还要帮助你们生产。”回去后，河底、白官、史儿庄、坦岭等村便抽了些民兵与自卫队，到玉泉岭、上白石、下白石、园楼白石、上泉等村帮助锄苗。他们分班排队，带着号兵，订有纪律，行动非常一致，都是耐心又积极的赶锄，稍马虎些就会受到班里批评。新区人民也以热诚相待，以前工人住庙，现在给谁家帮助就在谁家住，过去破工（因雨不够全工者）不给饭吃，不给全工钱，今日吃饭完全一样，吃得也好。休息时，他们便很亲热的交谈着，老区群众谈他互助生产由穷变富的经验，新区则谈他们的翻身斗争事迹，不到一百人的队伍，每天有一顷多地锄的精光。当他们在一礼拜以后离开的时候，村里人如别亲人一样，送的很远，并付给他们工资，他们推辞不要，新翻身了的人民过意不去，硬给了每个人每天一百、二百、三百元不等。有一老自卫队员语记者：“这和那二年不同，以前是给地主受，在地里可糟蛋来，谁往头里上，就拿土疙瘩打他，谁锄的深了，就说他‘底下有银子’？现在是帮助咱们刚翻转身的人，锄的不好，心里就过意不去”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: A Kuling dispatch reports that the *Lihsing Daily* here published an editorial entitled \"Correcting the Cowardly, Selfish Mentality and Absurd Arguments of *Ta Kung Pao*,\" publicly announcing that the Kuomintang government \"has no intention of recognizing\" the communique of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference last December. This demonstrates its determination to disregard opposition from domestic and international public opinion, persist in the civil war dictatorship, and defend Chiang Kai-shek, saying he is not Franco. The *Lihsing Daily* editorial claimed: \"China did not participate in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference last December, and is therefore not bound by the communique of this conference. After the communique of this conference was published, China had neither the intention of accepting it nor the intention of recognizing it.\" It slandered the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference communique as \"international interference,\" \"power politics,\" and \"aggression,\" indicating its unwillingness to abide by the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference communique to stop the civil war and reorganize government institutions, so that China could become an independent, peaceful, and democratic country. Chiang Kai-shek, fearing sanctions from the United Nations and international public opinion, used the *Lihsing Daily* to repeatedly say: \"Since the establishment of the National Government, international interference has followed one after another, but the National Government has no fear.\" But at the same time, he allows American imperialists to interfere in China's internal affairs and tortuously defends the continued presence of American troops in China, saying that this is \"based on the treaty of 1942,\" is \"repaying kindness with kindness,\" and is \"a righteous act of Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the China war zone,\" willingly selling China's territorial sovereignty to American imperialism.\n\nAfter Chiang Kai-shek read *Ta Kung Pao*'s warning not to become the second Spain, he immediately thought that he was the second Franco, and deeply feared falling into Franco's fate in diplomacy. Therefore, he ordered the *Lihsing Daily* to quickly issue a statement denying the obvious, saying, \"You regard the anti-aggression and anti-hegemony National Government as the aggressive Franco, which only proves that there is no justice in your mind.\"\n\nFinally, Chiang Kai-shek instructed the *Lihsing Daily* to warn *Ta Kung Pao* that \"those who fear punishment will inevitably be washed away by the tide of revolutionary China.\" This is because Chiang Kai-shek and others are very afraid that *Ta Kung Pao*'s article will affect his camp and make many people lose confidence in the civil war.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: In order to coordinate the launch of a nationwide civil war, Chiang Kai-shek recently personally presided over a national propaganda conference of the Kuomintang in Kuling to carry out anti-people and anti-communist deception and mobilization. According to a Central News Agency dispatch: The conference opened in Kuling on the morning of the 1st, convened by Deng Wenyi, director of the News Bureau of Chiang Kai-shek's government's Ministry of National Defense and one of the \"Thirteen Taibao of Revival.\" Chiang Kai-shek personally presided over the meeting and gave a one-hour \"instruction.\" Participants included more than 60 senior political officers from various headquarters (formerly known as \"Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters,\" now renamed \"Chairman's Headquarters\" after the establishment of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense), various Pacification Commissioner's Offices, and various armies and divisions. Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang, and foreign propaganda advisors to the Kuomintang government, Bell and Lu Qixin, also rushed to Kuling from Nanjing on the same day to participate. The conference is scheduled to close on the 5th. The Central News Agency stated: \"This conference will summarize and review the army's political work system and its achievements over the past 20 years, and determine a new style for future cultural and educational work in the military.\" Since Chiang Kai-shek abandoned the Nanjing peace talks and stepped onto this historically famous civil war command post—Mount Lu—he has convened a series of military and political conferences to carry out comprehensive civil war deployment and mobilization. On the 24th, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech at the Lushan Summer Camp, openly reviewing the history of the Ten-Year Civil War and examining the role of the Lushan Training Corps in 1933 during the tense military suppression of the Communists. He urged officers and students of the Summer Camp to recognize the \"great importance of the current mission\" and to engage in a \"final showdown\" with all democratic forces. At the same time, he used the official propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, and the newly established Kuling edition of the *Central Daily News* to widely fabricate rumors. In addition to issuing fabricated war reports every day, he repeatedly \"denied\" the facts that Division Commander Pan Shuoduan and Air Force Captain Liu Shanben resolutely withdrew from the civil war, as well as the loss of 20,000 people in northern Jiangsu, in order to stabilize the wavering and war-weary morale within the Chiang army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 牯岭力行日报著文  辩护蒋介石不是佛朗哥  却又公开表示坚持内战独裁，诋毁莫斯科三国外长决议。\n\n1946-08-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　牯岭力行日报著文\n    辩护蒋介石不是佛朗哥\n    却又公开表示坚持内战独裁，诋毁莫斯科三国外长决议。\n    【新华社延安三日电】牯岭讯：此间力行日报以“纠正大公报卑怯自私心理与荒唐论调”为题，发表社论，公开宣布国民党政府对去年十二月莫斯科三外长会议公报“没有承认的意思”，表明决心不顾国内外舆论的反对，坚持内战独裁，并替蒋介石辩获，说他不是佛朗哥。力行日报社论声称：“中国没有参加去年十二月莫斯科外长会议，当然不受这个会议公报的拘束，中国于这个会议公报发表之后，既没有接受的意思，也没有承认的意思”。污蔑三外长会议公报为“国际干涉”、“强权政治”与“侵略主义”，表明不愿遵照三外长会议公报停止内战与改组政府机构，使中国成为一独立和平民主的国家。蒋介石害怕联合国和国际舆论制裁，通过力行日报，口口声声说：“自国民政府成立后，国际干涉接踵而来，国民政府毫无畏惧”。但同时却又让美帝国主义者干涉中国内政，并曲意为美军留驻中国辩护，说这是“根据一九四二年的条约”，是“以德报德”，是“中国战区统帅蒋委员长义所予的”，甘心情愿把中国的领土主权出卖给美帝国主义。\n    蒋介石看了大公报警告不要做西班牙第二之后，立刻想到自己就是佛朗哥第二，并深惧在外交上会陷于佛朗哥的命运，于是命令力行日报赶快声明此地无银三百两，“你把反侵略强权的国民政府看做侵略主义的佛朗哥，这只是证明你的心目里面没有正义”。\n    最后蒋介石授意力行日报警告大公报说：“畏罪之徒是必为革命中国的潮流所冲洗”。这是因为蒋介石等十分害怕大公报那篇文章会影响他的营垒，使许多人失去内战的信心。\n    【新华社延安三日电】为配合全国规模内战之展开，蒋介石顷在牯岭亲自主持国民党全国性宣传会议，以进行反人民反共的欺骗和动员。据中央社讯：该会议一日晨在牯岭开幕，由蒋介石政府国防部新闻局长、复兴十三太保之一邓文仪召集，名称为“业务检讨会”，蒋介石亲临主持，并作一小时之“训话”，参加者有各行辕（按即前之“委员长行营”，蒋介石国防部成立后，现已改称“主席行辕”、各绥靖公署、各军师之高级政工人员等六十余人。国民党中宣部长彭学沛，国民党政府外人宣传顾问贝尔及卢祺新等，亦于是日由京赶到牯岭参加，会议定五日闭幕。中央社称：“此会将对二十余年来之军队政工制度及其成果作一总结检讨。并确定今后军中文化教育工作之新的作风”。自蒋介石抛开南京和平谈判，踏上这座历史上有名的内战司令台——庐山后，即召开一连串的军事政治会议，进行全面内战的布置和动员。二十四日，蒋在庐山夏令营训话，公然回溯十年内战历史，检讨民国二十二年剿共军事紧张时庐山训练团之作用，要夏令营官长、学生认识当前“使命的重大”，与一切民主势力“总决斗”。同时，即通过御用宣传机关中央社与新近特办之牯岭版中央日报，广泛制造谣言，除每日颁布捏造的战报外，并一再“否认”潘朔端师长和刘善本空军上尉毅然退出内战，以及苏北丧失二万人的事实，以安定蒋军内部动摇厌战的军心。"

Progressive members of the US House of Representatives have also risen up to oppose the US's policy of military aid to China. Representative Savage, a Democrat from Washington state (a supporter of the New Deal), strongly stated that the US government continues to supply military goods to China after the end of the Lend-Lease Act, without informing the American people. He pointed out that the surplus materials on Okinawa and other islands in the Pacific are enough to equip one million American troops. The US government is currently negotiating to sell these weapons to the Kuomintang government, as part of a new plan to lend China $500 million. He further pointed out that during the war, Chinese officials had deposits of $1 billion to $2 billion in the United States. He questioned why the Chinese government did not use these private deposits before the new plan to lend money to China was implemented. Savage accused some people of being responsible for the crime of helping China's civil war and threatening peace and security. Savage demanded that the US authorities stop this hypocritical policy. Mrs. Roosevelt agreed with Soong Ching Ling's statement, believing that giving up military intervention to promote peace is welcomed by the American people. Washington Post reporter Barnaby said: The United States speaks of peace, but it helps the Kuomintang government with economy and weapons.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国广大进步人士谴责当局军事援华\n\n1946-08-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国广大进步人士谴责当局军事援华\n    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社纽约二日电：不久前宋庆龄夫人反对美国干涉中国内政的声明，获得美国广大进步人士的赞成，美国进步的众议员亦纷起反对美国军事援华政策。华盛顿州民主党众议员沙瓦治（按系新政拥护者）力称：美政府在租借法案完结后，仍继续供应中国军事物品，而并没有将此事通知美国人民。他指出在冲绳岛及太平洋其他岛屿上的剩余物资，足以装备一百万美军，美国政府现时正进行谈判，将这些武器出卖给国民党政府，为作借予中国五亿美元的新计划。他继指出：在战时，中国官场要人在美的存款达十亿至二十亿美元，他质向在美国予中国贷款的新计划实现前，中国政府为什样不利用这些私人存款？沙氏指责某些人说，它们应对帮助中国内战，威胁和平与安全的罪恶负责。沙氏要求美国当局停止这一虚伪的政策。罗斯福夫人赞成宋庆龄夫人的声明，认为为促进和平，放弃军事干涉，这是美国人民所欢迎的。华盛顿邮报记者巴纳威说：美国在口头上讲和平，可是在经济与武器上帮助国民党政府。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: London News: British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt, in a speech in Newcastle on the 28th, pointed out that during the entire period of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' meeting preparing for the Paris Peace Conference, the United States had been striving to perfect its atomic bombs. The purpose of these experiments was to remind Britain and the Soviet Union: \"We have succeeded, and you have not.\" This is clearly an American policy of intimidation that is consistent with that country's attitude towards its own working class and its pursuit of aggressive imperialist goals. The Paris Conference needs to remember the power of the working class, and ask American businessmen like Byrnes to remember. In the final analysis, only the working class has the deciding voice on the question of peace or war, and the workers' answer will undoubtedly be peace. If the Labour government's foreign policy were determined by socialist principles rather than imperialist principles, if our country had truly tried to cooperate with the Soviet Union and the new Europe, and truly cooperate with labor and democratic forces, then the current serious international situation would not have arisen. It would have reached a point where Byrnes could not implement his current policy.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: New York News: Soviet representative Gromyko declared at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission on the 1st that the Soviet Union believes that the international inspection system proposed by the United States to determine whether any country is attempting to use atomic bombs for war would be an \"infringement on national independence.\" Gromyko explained in detail that the Soviet Union believes that this phenomenon cannot guarantee peace and security. Gromyko said: The Soviet Union proposed that it would support international action against any country being destroyed by an atomic energy convention, but the Soviet Union believes that the success or failure of any convention prohibiting atomic warfare will depend on the sincerity and willingness of the countries concerned to cooperate. Gromyko then reiterated that the United States should destroy all existing atomic bombs, without waiting for an international decision on control measures.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英共书记波立特  斥美国原子弹试验  苏重申美应破坏现存原子弹\n\n1946-08-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英共书记波立特\n    斥美国原子弹试验\n    苏重申美应破坏现存原子弹\n    【新华社延安二日电】伦敦讯：英共总书记波立特，于二十八日在新堡演说，提示在四强外长集会准备巴黎和会的整个期间美国曾竭力使其原子炸弹更臻完备，这些实验的目的，在新提醒英国和苏联说：“我们已经得手了而你们还没有”。这很清楚是美国的恫吓政策是与该国对其本国的工人阶级的态度与其对侵略的帝国主义目标的追求的传统符合一致的。巴黎会议需要记取工人阶级的力量，请贝纳斯之流的美国商人记取。归根说来，关于和平还是战争问题，只有工人阶级才有决定的发言权，工人的回答将是和平，这一点是毫无疑问的。如果工党政府的外交政策是由社会主义原则而非以帝国主义原则所决定的话，如果我国真正曾试图与苏联及新的欧洲真正合作，与劳工和民主势力真正合作的话，那么目前严重的国际形势不可能发生的。这样就会达到这样的地步，即贝纳斯不可能执行其现行政策。\n    【新华社延安二日电】纽约讯：苏代表葛罗米柯于一日在联合国原子能委员会上宣称：苏联认为美国所建议之国际视察制度以决是否有任何国家企图利用原子弹进行战争一点，将是“侵犯国家之独立”。葛氏详细解释称：苏联认为这种现象不能保障和平与安全。葛氏说：苏联提出它将支持反对任何国家被破坏原子能公约之国际行动，但苏联认为禁止原子战争任何公约之成败，将决于有关各国合作之诚意与愿望。葛氏继即重申美国应毁坏一切现存原子弹，而不要等待国际关于管制办法之决定。"

    "content": "Visiting Director Zhu of the Health Bureau\n    Acupuncture Treatment Shows Good Results\n    Director Zhu Continues Research\n    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On the 3rd, this reporter visited Comrade Zhu Lian, Director of the Border Region Health Bureau. She was busy diagnosing patients in a spacious and quiet courtyard, inquiring about their symptoms, and performing her famous acupuncture. She had been diligently and continuously working for seven or eight days in this lush green village during the muggy mid-summer season, having come from Handan. Sometimes, she meticulously diagnosed twelve or thirteen patients in one go. According to medical practice, a doctor's energy is usually not sufficient to meticulously diagnose ten people at once. The day before yesterday, she went to a neighboring village to see patients, working all day and rushing back at dusk. She caught a cold after getting drenched in a sudden rain shower while covered in sweat. After resting for half a day, she started busily receiving patients again. Clearly, she was somewhat thin and tired, but she was cheerfully persevering.\n    The Health Bureau was established in the first month of the lunar year, and at that time, there was only Director Zhu. There were no doctors, pharmacists, or nurses. After many efforts, they managed to recruit seven or eight doctors, but the pharmacists and nurses were all trained in-house. They adopted a \"little teacher\" system, where doctors taught nurses, and nurses who learned the skills taught new nurses. Within half a year, they trained many cadres, and now they have four pharmacists and more than thirty nurses. Director Zhu said modestly: We haven't treated many patients. In half a year, we treated 5,787 people. This includes personnel from Party, government, and military organizations, as well as ordinary people, with the latter accounting for one-third of the total. Currently, medicines are very expensive. The Health Bureau provides free preferential treatment to many people. The actual drug fees collected were only 170,000 yuan, while the free medical care amounted to more than 610,000 yuan.\n    \"Prevention is more important than treatment.\" The Health Bureau has taken some active and effective steps. In the spring, they provided free smallpox vaccinations, vaccinating 4,500 people in April alone. Now, they are vaccinating people against cholera and typhoid. In July, 20,000 people were vaccinated in Handan City. Regarding other urban sanitation work, they are actively promoting it in cooperation with relevant departments. When the land reform teams went to the countryside, the Health Bureau sent two epidemic prevention and medical teams to work in Handan and Linzhang, and another one in Handan City. There are many patients in the countryside, and poor patients cannot afford medicine. Hearing that the medical teams provided free medical care, they brought the old and the young to seek treatment. A seventy-year-old woman said, \"I have lived for seventy years and have never seen anything like this.\" Many grateful words reached the ears of the medical team comrades. \"Serving the people\" brought them the greatest comfort. Although the medical team comrades' lives were hard, their work was busy, and medicines were scarce, they were very excited in their busy work. Although they were small in number, they had treated 806 people in three weeks. A large part of them were cured by acupuncture.\n    \"What is the scientific basis of acupuncture?\" Director Zhu said: \"It is scientific, using stimulation of nerves to produce a kind of electrotherapy effect.\" She said: Acupuncture has a very fast effect and can cure many diseases that are difficult to cure with drugs. At the same time, it can considerably solve the difficulty of drug shortages. An old farmer in Linzhang suffered from esophageal stricture and vomited up food immediately after eating. He could not be cured for many years. The comrades of the medical team performed four acupuncture treatments, and he was able to eat, move, and work in the fields. Another old lady suffering from hemiplegia was also cured by the medical team with two acupuncture treatments. Director Zhu has accumulated considerable experience in experimenting with acupuncture for more than a year, and has also trained more than ten cadres who can perform acupuncture independently. She plans to continue her research and write articles on the theory and experience of acupuncture in the near future to promote this scientific Chinese ancient medical method.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 访问卫生局朱局长  针灸治疗效果良好  朱局长正继续研究\n\n1946-08-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　访问卫生局朱局长\n    针灸治疗效果良好\n    朱局长正继续研究\n    【本报特讯】三日，记者往访边区卫生局局长朱琏同志，她正在一个宽敞寂静的院子里忙着诊断，询问病人的症状，进行其有名的针灸。他在这溽热的中伏季节，由邯郸来到这个绿树荫浓的乡村中，已经紧张而持续的忙了七八天了。有时候精细的一口气诊断十二三个病人，按照医界惯例，一个医生的精力是不能一次精细的诊断十个人的。前天她去邻近一个村子看病，忙了整整一天，黄昏时匆匆赶回，出了满身大汗的身子淋了急雨，病了，休息半天，又开始忙碌的接待病人。显然她有些消瘦和疲倦，但是她在愉快的支持着。\n    卫生局是正月成立的，当时只有朱局长一个人。医生、司药、护士都没有。经过多方努力，总算网罗邀聘了七八位医生，司药和护士却都是自己培养的。他们采取“小先生”制，医生教护士，学会了的护士教新来的护士，半年之间培养了不少干部，到现在已有四个司药，三十多个护士了。朱局长很谦逊的说：我们治的病不算多，半年的时间治了五千七百八十七个人。这里面包括党政军各机关和老百姓，后者占了总数的三分之一。现在药品很贵，卫生局把免费的优待给予很多人，实收的药费不过十七万，而免费的则达六十一万余元。\n    “预防重于治疗”，卫生局采取了一些积极有效的步骤。在春天，他们为人免费种牛痘，只四月份就种了四千五百人，现在又在为人们注射霍乱、伤寒疫苗，七月份邯郸市注射了两万人。关于其他城市卫生工作，他们正协同有关方面积极推行。翻身队下乡的时候，卫生局派了两个防疫医疗队分到邯郸、临漳工作，还有一个在邯郸市。乡村病人很多，贫苦的病患者无力吃药，听说医疗队看病不要钱，都扶老携幼的跑去求医，七十岁的老婆婆说：“我活了七十岁没看见过。”许多感激的语言传到医疗队同志的耳朵里，“为群众服务”得到最大的安慰，医疗队的同志们生活虽苦、工作虽忙、药品虽然缺乏，但在忙碌中却非常兴奋，他们人数不多，在三个星期时间内却已经治疗了八百零六个人。其中有很大一部分是针灸治愈的。\n    “针灸的科学性究竟怎么样呢？”朱局长说：“它是科学的，利用刺激神经，起一种电疗作用。”她说：针灸的效果极快，能治许多药物所难治愈的病，同时可以相当解决一些药品缺乏的困难。临漳有一老农，患食道窄狭病，吃了饭就原封吐出来，经年累月不能治好。医疗队的同志施行了四次针灸，他就能吃饭，能行动，而且能上地了。另有一位老太太患半身不遂，也由医疗队施行两次针灸治好了。朱局长在实验针灸一年多的时间中，曾积累了相当的经验，也培养了十多个干部，都能单独进行针灸了。她准备继续研究，并在最近写一些关于针灸的理论与经验的文章，以提倡这种科学化了的中国古医法。"

The venue was arranged with extreme solemnity and tranquility. Passing through a filial archway made of cypress branches, alongside the green, shaded path, long white banners filled the scene, bearing elegies and memorial couplets. On the stage were placed the memorial tablets of the martyrs, draped with purplish-red and grayish-blue curtains. Below the stage, various wreaths, handmade by organizations, schools, and the faculty and students of Beida, were displayed, alongside various \"wall newspapers\" specially published in memory of the two martyrs, as well as \"newspaper clippings\" reflecting the current democratic and anti-democratic struggle. All these items dedicated to mourning the dead fully represented everyone's inner grief and anger!\n\nThe meeting commenced at 8:30 AM, attended by representatives from the Municipal Government, district offices, the Federation of Commerce, Xinhua Bookstore, Xingtai Normal School, Agricultural Vocational School, Yide Middle School, the Elementary and Middle School Teachers' Weekly Training Class, the Catholic Church, the Christian Church, as well as faculty and students of Beida staying on campus during the summer vacation, numbering five to six hundred people. Also present were Ms. Feng Wei and Mr. Wu Jinglüe, representatives of the China Democratic League, who were recently passing through from Beiping.\n\nChairman Luo Qing's few simple and mournful opening remarks struck a chord in the heart of every attendee. Indeed, \"This is a memorial meeting, but also a revenge meeting, a self-defense meeting! Revenge against whom? Self-defense against whom? Revenge against the fascist Chiang Kai-shek who murdered our democratic comrades and attacked our liberated areas, and a self-defense!\" Under the fiery July sun, everyone sweated, but also burned with grief and revenge, commemorating the dead with a dual sentiment.\n\nFollowing the solemn public memorial ceremony, Peking University President Fan Wenlan first pointed out that the assassination of the two martyrs was, on the one hand, our loss, but on the other hand, we must also see that Chiang Kai-shek is at his wit's end, and has had to resort to gangster assassination tactics. Now, in various places, Kuomintang troops are constantly rebelling and withdrawing from the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek has reached the point of the Xinhai Revolution, the Wuchang Uprising, the responses from various places, and the collapse of the Manchu Qing Dynasty.\n\nChina Democratic League representative Mr. Wu, after narrating the biographies of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen, said: \"Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were both leaders of the China Democratic League. We are also preparing to hold a memorial meeting in Beiping, but there we cannot find a public place to hold the memorial meeting, because there is no freedom for us there. Mr. Wen Yiduo was assassinated when he was walking out of Mr. Li Gongpu's memorial meeting venue. Those of us who are preparing to hold the memorial meeting must be prepared to take the third bullet...\"\n\nMs. Feng Wei said very excitedly: \"The Kuomintang killed our leaders, and they don't even allow us to cry there, don't allow us to mourn. Is there any country in the world that is so reactionary?\" \"All of our cultural workers are living half-starved lives. All of our China Democratic League workers are included in the secret agents' blacklist. Young students are being arrested everywhere. Everyone is in danger of being murdered and imprisoned in concentration camps. How can we be like you, freely breathing, freely studying, working, and researching in a free paradise?\" \"The Kuomintang keeps saying that no party in any country has an army, and that if the CCP does not lay down its arms, it must be eliminated. The facts are most obvious. Our China Democratic League is not armed. We demand peace and democracy. Isn't that very reasonable? However, we have suffered massacres. If the Communist Party lays down its weapons today, I dare to guarantee that the Communist Party would not be able to exist for long, and you would never get such a peaceful, democratic, and free paradise. This is an iron fact, this is a lesson learned from blood!\" When Ms. Feng said this, applause thundered throughout the venue. The shouts of \"We must repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive! We must help the people in the Kuomintang areas!\" echoed through the clouds. Finally, Mr. Feng Wei firmly said: \"We have resolute confidence that Chiang Kai-shek cannot kill all of the millions of peace-loving and democratic people in the country! The cause of peace and democracy will surely be victorious.\"\n\nFinally, after speeches by Xingtai Normal School Principal Wang Yonglie, Federation of Commerce Chairman Zhang, and other representatives, the meeting passed two telegrams: one protesting the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary secret agent group, and one expressing condolences to the families of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen.\n\n(Kang Zhi)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 七月炎阳下燃起复仇烈火  邢市学校机关悼李闻  民盟代表冯吴二氏激愤致词\n康志\n1946-08-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　七月炎阳下燃起复仇烈火\n    邢市学校机关悼李闻\n    民盟代表冯吴二氏激愤致词\n    【本报北方大学讯】以北大为主的邢市各学校机关团体追悼李闻二烈士大会于三十日上午八时在北大操场举行，会场布置极为庄严静穆，通过柏枝搭成的孝坊，绿树荫翳的甬道旁，张满了长幅的白布标语，与挽词挽联，台上置着烈士的灵位，绛紫和青灰色的幔幕垂挂着，台下更陈列着各机关学校及北大师生亲手制备的各种形状的花圈，以及专为追悼两烈士而刊出的多种《壁报》、反映目前民主与反民主斗争情况的《剪报》，这许许多多祭挽死者的东西，充分的代表着大家内心的悲痛与怒火！\n    八时半开会，到会有市政府、各区署、商联会、新华书店、邢台师范、农职学校、义德中学、中小教员星期讲习班、天主堂、基督教会等代表与北大暑假留校师生五六百人，另有最近从北平路过此地的民盟代表冯伟女士与吴景略先生。\n    主席罗青先生几句简短沉痛的开幕词，打中在每个与会者的心坎上。是的，“这是追悼大会，也是复仇大会，自卫大会！对谁复仇？对谁自卫？对杀死我们的民主战友和进攻我们解放区的法西斯蒋介石复仇和举行自卫！”大家在七月的烈日下，挥着汗，也燃着悲痛与复仇的烈火，以双重的心情来祭奠死者。\n    隆重的公祭礼成，北大校长范文澜先生，首先指出二烈士的被暗杀，一方面是我们的损失，另一方面我们也要看到蒋介石已经毫无办法，不得不用流氓暗杀政策。现在各处国民党的部队不断起义退出内战，蒋介石已经到了辛亥革命、武昌起义、各地响应、满清垮台时的地步。\n    民盟代表吴先生叙述了李闻二先生简历之后说：“李闻二先生都是民盟的领导人，我们在北平也正筹备开追悼会，但是在那里我们找不到一个能开追悼会的公共场所，因为那里没有我们的自由，闻一多先生就是在走出李公朴先生追悼会会场时被暗杀的，我们准备开追悼会的人，都必须抱着吃第三颗子弹的决心……”\n    冯伟女士非常激动的说：“国民党杀了我们的领导者，在他们那里还不许我们哭，不许我们追悼，世界上还有没有像这样反动的国家？”“我们所有的文化工作者，没有不是过着半饥饿的生活，我们所有的民盟工作者，都列入了特务的黑名单，青年学生普遍的被捕，人人都有遭残杀被关入集中营去的危险，那能像你们这样在自由的乐园里，自由呼吸，自由研究学习和工作？”“国民党口口声声说任何国家的党派都没有军队，中共若不放下武器非消灭中共不可。事实最明显，我们民盟是没有武装的，我们要求和平与民主，这不是很合理的吗？但是，我们却遭受了屠杀，假如今天共产党放下了武器，我敢保证共产党早也存在不住，你们也绝得不到这样和平民主自由的乐园，这是铁的事实，这是血的教训！”冯女士讲至此，全场的掌声雷动，“我们要击退蒋介石的进攻！我们要援助国民党区的老百姓。”的口号声响彻了云霄，最后冯伟先生坚决的说：“我们有坚决的自信，全国千千万万的和平民主人士，蒋介石是杀不完的！和平民主事业一定能得到胜利。”\n    最后在邢师校长王永烈先生、商联会张主席等代表陆续讲话之后，大会通过抗议蒋介石反动特务集团罪行与慰问李闻二先生家属的两个通电。\n    （康志）"

The purpose is to obstruct the progress of the group's work and create an excuse to restrict the freedom of our group members in the Nationalist area.

Because the CCP representatives were unaware that he was going to Anyang so hastily, they hoped to learn about the situation in Yongnian from him and help the group's work. Therefore, they notified the border guards to ask him to return. Major Dai returned to the group on July 18th, and the CCP side received him and gave him the same daily treatment as other group members.

Ji has always colluded with the government to oppress the common people. After the incident, he intensified his actions, relying on the pseudo-county chief Zhao Wentao and the pseudo-captain Luan Ziyu to rape women, seize people's wealth, and kill a total of fifteen people, extorting and seizing countless farmers' land and property. At the meeting, the victims competed to accuse him of his inhuman crimes. Han Yushi cried and said: \"My daughter was forced to sell to Ji Xiaofan as a maid when she was eleven years old. She was raped by him when she was fifteen. At seventeen, she was pregnant and driven out. Her father went to the yamen to sue, but he was falsely accused of selling white flour and shot dead by the yamen. My daughter was so ashamed and angry that she hanged herself!\" She gritted her teeth and shouted: \"Now I want to avenge my daughter and my old man!\" Ji bought a seventeen-year-old maid from Ni Zhuang. She was raped as soon as she entered the door. After Ji raped her, he watched his wife beat her violently and used a burning opium stick to pierce her to death from her vagina. A total of five people were raped to death by the tyrant Ji Xiaofan in this way, all of them girls aged eleven to seventeen. When a fellow villager ×× accused Ji of残害(cánhài: brutally killing or harming) all five members of the family of his clansman Liu Dianchen, he burst into tears and fainted. He indignantly stated that Ji Xiaofan seized Liu's wife and then seized his three daughters, and finally seized all of his family's forty-odd acres of good land. Liu saw that his wife, daughters, and property had been robbed, and he was so angry that he could not seek justice anywhere, and he died of anger. Liu's wife also died of shame and hatred because she herself had been defiled and all three of her daughters had been raped. The masses shouted angrily: \"Down with this inhuman beast!\" and raised their fists to pull Ji Xiaofan down and beat him to death to vent their anger. Finally, they unanimously decided to hand him over to the government for punishment according to the law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 临清市数千市民愤怒集会  斗争恶霸地主冀筱帆  这畜牲奸杀诬害惨绝人寰\n\n1946-08-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　临清市数千市民愤怒集会\n    斗争恶霸地主冀筱帆\n    这畜牲奸杀诬害惨绝人寰\n    【本报威县讯】上月十六日临清市二千余市民集会，以愤怒的情绪斗争大恶霸地主冀筱帆。冀历来就勾结官府欺压平民，事变后更变本加厉，依仗伪县长赵文涛、伪大队长栾子玉，强奸民女，霸占民财，共害死人命十五条，讹、霸农民土地财产无算。会上苦主们纷纷争着控诉他的非人罪行，韩于氏痛哭流涕的说：“俺闺女十一岁上被迫卖给冀筱帆当侍女，十五岁就被他强奸了，十七岁身怀有孕被赶出来，她爹去衙门告状，反被衙门诬为私卖白面把他枪毙了，俺闺女又羞又气上吊死了！”她咬牙切齿的狂喊：“如今我要给俺闺女、老汉报仇雪恨啊！”冀从倪庄买来一个十七岁的侍女，进门就被强奸，冀强奸后眼看着他老婆将她毒打一顿，用烧大烟的签子从阴户里把她活活通死。像这样被恶霸冀筱帆奸死的共五个人，都是十一到十七岁的姑娘。××老乡替全家五口被冀残害的本家刘殿臣控诉时，哭不成声，晕倒在地。他愤激地诉说冀小帆霸占了刘的老婆后，又霸占他的三个女儿，最后把他家四十几亩好地也全部霸占了。刘见妻女财产被劫一空，愤激不过，无处伸冤，活活气死了，刘妻亦因自身被污及三个女儿全部被奸，羞恨而死。群众怒呼：“打倒这不是人的畜类！”并高举拳头要将冀小帆拉下来揍死以泄公愤，最后一致决议交政府依法惩办。"

    "content": "Suppressing the Black Market to Benefit the People\n    Handan Currency Exchange Opens\n    Transactions Totaling Over 18 Million Yuan in Three Days\n    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 30th] The Handan Currency Exchange held its opening ceremony yesterday (29th) at 9:00 AM, officially opening for business at No. 122, west end of Heping Road, east of the main street (the former site of the Jinnan Bank). The venue was filled with representatives from various industry associations and banks, as well as brokers. Citizens were also densely packed outside the counter. After the opening, Director Ma Yourong of the Exchange explained, \"Under the leadership of the democratic government, all trade that benefits the broad masses of the people is free. Under the government's policy of controlling foreign exchange, gold, silver, Customs Gold Units, and French currency, through brokers, prices are made transparent at the Currency Exchange. Trading currencies is completely free in the Currency Exchange. You can sell for whatever price you want, as long as someone buys it. The Exchange does not restrict prices.\" When Vice Mayor Feng of Handan was invited to speak, he emphasized, \"The establishment of the Exchange is to eliminate the black market. The black market is illegal and not transparent. This kind of black market not only affects merchants but also affects the lives of the broad masses of the people. For example, in the black market, those who want to buy cannot buy, and those who want to sell cannot sell. Through those rogue 'runners,' buyers pay high prices, and sellers get low prices, with significant exploitation in between, which leads to high prices and affects the lives of the broad masses of the people. To take care of the interests of all merchants and the lives of the broad masses of the people, the Currency Exchange was established. In the Currency Exchange, currencies can be freely traded, and the government will never restrict it. If you do not trade in the Exchange and engage in the black market, you are violating policy, and the government will severely crack down on it.\" After Chairman Wang Jingran of the Exchange reported on the establishment process following Vice Mayor Feng's speech, he explained the rules of the Currency Exchange: \"The Exchange also posts prices, but not in advance. There is a morning session and an afternoon session. The prices of transactions in the morning are posted at 12:00 PM, and the prices of transactions in the afternoon are posted the next morning, indicating the highest and lowest amounts. Brokers usually operate, but do not set prices privately below. At the opening of the session, prices can be raised or lowered according to the market. Transactions are made in the Exchange market. The Exchange welcomes transactions, welcomes visitors, and welcomes listening to market prices. If the market is right, sell; if not, don't. Brokers are only allowed to charge a 1% commission, with 30% of that 1% going to the public and 70% going to private. Those who do not want to be named in the transaction can entrust it to a broker. Brokers must implement policies and must not engage in secret market deals. If they do, they will be dealt with according to the law.\" Chairman Wang finally hoped that the people of the city would supervise the brokers, and the brokers would supervise each other, to ensure the benefit of all merchants and citizens. After the representative of the Commercial Federation spoke, trading began immediately. People inside and outside the counter stopped their fans and listened to the announced prices. Some made deals on the spot if the prices matched, and some didn't if they didn't match. As a result, each broker completed at least one transaction. Even after the time was up, everyone was still competing to make deals. (Farmer)\n    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 1st] Since its establishment, the total transaction value of the Handan Currency Exchange has been increasing day by day. The total value of the past three days is announced as follows: The first day (29th), the total value at the end of the morning and afternoon sessions was 2,901,048 Jicha Yuan. The second day (30th), the morning session was extended from the stopping time of 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and the afternoon session was extended from the stopping time of 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM, with a total value of 9,251,909 Jicha Yuan. The third day, the morning session was the same as the first day. In the afternoon, to take care of the staff's energy, it was only extended to 7:30 PM, but it still reached a total of 7,849,930 Yuan.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. Paris dispatch: The Rules Committee of the Peace Conference continued its meeting on the 3rd to discuss the candidates for the Chairman of the General Assembly. At the meeting, the Dutch representative withdrew his proposal to appoint Beel as the permanent chairman of the General Assembly, but put forward a new plan to select the chairman of the General Assembly from the chief representatives of the twenty-one countries, instead of just having the four powers rotate. Molotov warned the Netherlands against this move, saying that small countries should not attempt to overturn the decisions of the four powers, as this would inevitably cause panic and confusion in world opinion. Molotov stated that he would clearly oppose any attempt to change the decisions already passed by the four countries, especially the new plan of the Netherlands, and insisted that the committee pass the four-power recommendation, that is, Molotov, Byrnes, Attlee, and Beel should take turns as chairman. The Czechoslovak delegation requested the committee to accept the four-power decision to speed up the work, and said, \"If we cannot agree on such a simple issue, then how will we solve bigger problems?\" Beel also notified the Dutch representative on the evening of the 2nd that he would not accept the position of permanent chairman unless there was a unanimous vote. But he also proposed a method, that is, \"the conference elects the chairman,\" so that the vast majority can control the election. After debate, the Dutch new plan was rejected by twelve votes (including the four powers, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Byelorussia and Ukraine, etc.) to eight votes (one abstention). Supporters of the Netherlands included Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Belgium.\n    Furthermore, the plenary session of the Peace Conference also continued on the 3rd, with representatives continuing to deliver speeches. The Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, delivered a speech, warning against repeating the mistakes of 1919.

    "content": "Thoroughly Smash Feudal Rule\n    Wu'an Conducts a Thorough Overhaul Examination\n    Uniting Ninety Percent of Farmers to Thoroughly Turn Themselves Over\n    \"Unity is Strength, Help Those Who Can't Stand Up\"\n    [Reported by this newspaper] More than a thousand land reform heroes, activists, and model cadres from 109 villages in Wu'an County's seven new districts gathered in late July in the county town and various districts to hold meetings. Based on Chairman Mao's spirit in \"On Coalition Government\" regarding land reform and Sun Yat-sen's \"Land to the Tiller\" ideal, they conducted a county-wide thorough overhaul examination. Since the beginning of summer, mass movements throughout the county have achieved significant results in the comprehensive and in-depth movement. However, due to insufficient leadership in guiding activists to lead the masses, and in enabling intermediate and backward elements to consciously take action, a complacent attitude of \"good enough\" arose, believing that no further large-scale struggles were possible. Furthermore, the county was preparing for self-defense, leading to the stagnation or interruption of mass movements in many villages. In the ten villages of Boyan, Tonghui, and Longquan in the Third District, which were said to have deep movements, the farmers' accounting and struggle against 48 large and medium landlords were not thorough. The large landlord in Tonghui still possessed a lot of land, while more than 40 poor farmers had not yet obtained any. In Cuilu Village in the Tenth District, more than 90 farmer households had only an average of one or two mu of land per household. In Wuji Village in the Second District, the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association who led the farmers to turn themselves over had not yet fully expressed his suffering or received any land. Many masses groaning under the oppression of landlords, bullies, and traitorous spies had not yet been fully mobilized. In Yuquanling Village, which was holding a meeting to discuss turning themselves over, farmer Wang Kaitai, whose house collapsed due to heavy rain, anxiously ran home after being called by his children. These facts reminded many activists that after eight months of the land reform movement, they still did not have a house or were living in dilapidated houses. Meanwhile, landlords like Wang Damaizi, a large landlord in Chengguan First Street, still possessed more than two hundred or hundreds of good houses. After the examination, everyone became clear-headed and began to investigate why they hadn't thoroughly turned themselves over. They then discovered that many village cadres and masses had the idea of \"not wanting land,\" mistakenly believing the rumors spread by spies: fearing that they would be struggled against again if they had land, not understanding the democratic government's burden policies, fearing burdens, fearing a change of regime, and even developing lazy thoughts, saying, \"The Communist Party won't let anyone starve to death, what do we need land for,\" waiting for grain after the autumn harvest. Some cadres were threatened, lured, and deceived by spies and landlords, and protected landlords. The militia captain of Chewangkou in the Third District was controlled by the landlord, and the militiamen he developed were all small landlords. When the Farmers' Association held meetings, he would lead the militia to disband the association. Due to inappropriate distribution of the fruits of struggle, troublemakers and bad elements provoked disunity among cadres and the masses, among cadres themselves, and among various organizational systems. The funds from the struggle in Longquan are still piled up in the Farmers' Association. All these stumbling blocks hindering the land reform were examined. Immediately, a heated discussion was held on how to thoroughly turn themselves over. Liu Ronghe, the more than fifty-year-old chairman of the Farmers' Association in Nanyingjing in the Fifth District, recalled his years of suffering as a hired laborer, saying: \"We shouldn't forget the pain once the knife is put away. We worked hard all our lives in the past, wasn't it all for two mu of land? But I suffered for one or two decades, sweating and crying, year after year, from the fields to carrying water and sweeping the yard, suffering to death and still being a pauper! Now that the Communist Party is leading us to turn ourselves over, if we don't want to thoroughly turn ourselves over, if we don't want to farm, we'll still end up with nothing in the end. The land is clean but the clothes are torn, and we'll still be hungry after working as a day laborer!\" These words stirred up the more than three hundred people present, who resolved to go back and thoroughly turn themselves over. A primary school teacher from Shangzhuang in the Fourth District, who actively helped farmers to turn themselves over, said: \"The landlords in our village all say they have been overthrown, but they are still running coal mines, secretly inviting bad cadres to eat eggs and drink wine at night, spreading rumors about a change of regime, and preparing to counterattack. We must thoroughly settle accounts with them, and after overturning the 'stone slab,' we must smash it, otherwise it will press down on us again!\" Each district proposed that the standard for turning themselves over was: \"Having a house and land, having food and clothing, everything from head to toe belonging to oneself.\" To expand the Farmers' Association organization, leaving no backward villages or backward people, they proposed: \"Hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants are one family. We have neither horses nor sedans to ride. Unity is strength for turning ourselves over.\" \"Help the backward villages, and help those who can't stand up.\" Truly \"everyone opens their mouths, and everyone benefits.\" The distribution of the fruits of struggle should take into account various different situations, help orphans, widows, and the helpless poor to establish cooperatives and build homes, and cadres and the masses should unite well and support and love each other. \"Don't stab yourselves in the leg with a knife,\" help cadres change their work style, and \"share blessings and gain both fame and fortune,\" clearly recognizing: \"Corruption, bribery, and being deceived leads to losing face, wealth, and power.\" \"Exploitation and getting rich is not a long-term solution, but the poor turning themselves over will last for ten thousand years.\" Land reform is a life-and-death struggle, and should be \"merciless towards the enemy, and treating diseases and saving people internally.\" Go back to each village and launch a thorough overhaul examination, immediately expand the farmers' camp and launch a fierce and comprehensive advance against the feudal rulers, launch a land reform competition, unite ninety percent of the farmers to thoroughly turn themselves over, and follow Chairman Mao! They also proposed four things to not be afraid of: first, not being afraid of being sorry to the landlords; second, not being afraid of landlords pretending to be poor and scolding; third, not being afraid of a change of regime and being struggled against again; and fourth, not being afraid of middle peasants lagging behind. The meeting successfully concluded on the afternoon of the first of this month. Encouraged by the unity and victory, everyone braved the torrential rain and embarked on their journey home. When parting, everyone cheered, \"The sooner we do it thoroughly, the sooner we benefit, land reform and self-defense is a good time!\" (Yifan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 彻底粉碎封建统治  武安进行翻身大检查  团结百分之九十农民把身翻透  “团结起来力量大站不起来扶扶他”\n一帆\n1946-08-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　彻底粉碎封建统治\n    武安进行翻身大检查\n    团结百分之九十农民把身翻透\n    “团结起来力量大站不起来扶扶他”\n    【本报讯】武安县七个新区一百零九村的翻身英雄、积极分子与模范干部等千余人，七月下旬分别在县城及各区举行集会，根据毛主席“论联合政府”中土地改革及孙中山先生“耕者有其田”的精神，进行全县翻身大检查。入夏以来，全县群运在全面深入运动中，虽然获得显著成绩，但由于领导上对于积极分子领导群众运动到中间分子与落后分子自觉起来行动认识不足，认为不可能再有更大规模的斗争，产生了“差不多”的自满思想，加以全县准备自卫，不少村庄群运消沉或中断。三区伯延、同会、龙泉等十个号称运动深入的村庄，农民对四十八个大、中地主的算账斗争亦并不彻底。同会大地主仍拥有很多土地，而未获得土地的贫苦农民，则仍有四十多户。十区崔炉村有九十余户农民，平均每户只有一、二亩地。二区午汲村领导农民翻身的农会副主席，自己还没有诉尽痛苦，没有得到土地。许多呻吟在地主恶霸与汉奸特务压抑下的群众，还未充分发动起来。正在开会讨论翻身的玉泉岭村，农民王开太，因大雨淋塌房子被孩子召唤非常不安的跑回家去，这些事实引起许多积极分子回忆起自己翻身运动了八个月，连房子还没有，或住的破房子。而城关一街大地主王大麻子等拥有二百多间或百数十间好房子的地主，还到处存在着。经过检查，大家清醒了，纷纷追究为什么没有翻透身，于是发现不少村干部和群众存在“不愿要土地”的思想，误信特务造谣：怕有了土地再挨斗，不了解民主政府的负担政策，怕负担，怕变天，甚至产生懒汉思想，说“共产党不让饿死一个人，要土地干啥”，等着秋后要粮食。有的干部被特务地主威胁、利诱、欺骗，包庇地主。三区车辋口民兵队长被地主掌握在手里，发展民兵都是小地主，农会开会，他即带领民兵解散农会。由于分配果实不适当而被特务坏蛋挑拨，引起干部群众间、干部相互间、各组织系统间的不团结现象。龙泉斗争出来的款，现在还堆在农会里。凡此种种阻碍翻身的绊脚石，都被检讨出来。随即热烈进行如何才能翻透身的大讨论。五区南营井五十多岁的老农会主席刘荣和回忆自己多年当长工的痛苦说：“咱不要拔了刀子忘了痛，过去辛辛苦苦受一辈子，还不是为了二亩土，可是俺受了一二十年，汗一把、泪一把，一年到头，秋收冬藏，地里回来担水扫院，受死也还是一个穷光蛋！如今共产党领导咱翻身，还不想翻透，不想种地，赶后还是一场空，地净衣衫破，打罢短工还挨饿！”这一席话把三百多到会的人激动起来，决心回去翻个透身。四区上庄积极帮助农民翻身的小学教员说：“俺村地主，都说斗垮了，可是人家还开着大煤窑，黑夜偷请坏干部吃鸡蛋、喝酒，造谣变天，准备反攻，咱一定要和他彻底算账，掀了“石板”还要打碎它，不然会再压到头上来！”各区都纷纷提出翻身标准是：“有房有地，有吃有穿，头顶脚蹬都是自己。”要扩大农会组织，不留落后村，不留落后人，提出：“雇贫中农是一家，骑马坐轿都没有咱，团结翻身力量大。”“落后村帮一把，站不起来的，扶扶他。”真正“要大家张嘴，大家得利”。分配斗争果实要照顾各种不同情况，帮助孤寡无劳力的穷人成立合作社，建立家务，干部和群众团结好、拥干爱民，“不要拿起刀子往自己腿上扎”，帮助干部转变作风，要“有福同享，名利双全”，明确认识：“贪污受贿受欺骗，丢脸丢财又丢权。”“剥削发财不长远，穷人翻身万万年。”翻身是个生死斗争，应该是“对外你死我活，对内治病救人”，回去各村展开一个翻身大检查，立即扩大农民阵营猛烈地向封建统治者全面进军，发动翻身竞赛，团结百分之九十农民翻身翻透，跟上毛主席走！又提出四不怕：一不怕对不起地主，二不怕地主装穷叫骂，三不怕变天、再挨斗，四不怕中农落后。本月一日下午会议胜利结束，在团结胜利信心鼓舞下，大家冒着倾盆大雨，踏上归途，分别时，大家欢呼着“早搞彻底早沾光，翻身自卫好时光！”（一帆）"

    "content": "Eulogy to Martyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo\nFan Wenlan\nMartyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were brutally murdered by the traitorous and country-selling bandit Chiang Kai-shek. The blood of the two martyrs has been poured into the raging fire of the Chinese people's anti-American and anti-traitorous struggle, and the flames are even higher. Rest in peace, martyrs! Your righteous blood will definitely not be shed in vain.\n\nFor the past hundred years, the landlord and comprador classes have produced major traitors and country sellers, the most famous being Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, Yuan Shikai, and Duan Qirui, who sold out almost all of China. But compared to Chiang Kai-shek's straightforward and thorough betrayal, they are insignificant and cannot be considered major traitors and bandits. The only one comparable is Wang Jingwei, a true pair of villainous brothers among the traitors!\n\nChiang Kai-shek attempted to seize all the fruits of the War of Resistance against Japan, to maintain his fascist dictatorship forever, and brazenly sold out everything in China to seek aid from American imperialism. He sold the sky, the sea, the inland rivers, and the customs. He sold everything he could sell. He still felt it was not enough, and he even sold the so-called \"final decision-making power.\" In other words, he sold out the entire Chinese government, turning China into an American Philippines and the Chinese people into American black slaves, so that he could \"honorably serve\" as American imperialism's puppet emperor. This major traitor and bandit, who embodies the culmination of evil, thought he had succeeded and妄图迫促 attempted to force the CCP delegation to agree to his \"honorable service.\" After running into a brick wall, he took out a so-called Marshal Ma trump card to scare people. This is truly a specimen of \"not knowing the meaning of shame.\" If one were to try to find the word \"shame\" in his mind, it would be harder than撈月 retrieving the moon from the bottom of the sea, because he doesn't even have a shadow of shame, despite constantly shouting \"propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.\"\n\nThe Americans and Chiang Kai-shek engaged in a transaction where neither side put up any capital. American imperialism sold surplus munitions that were about to be dumped into the sea, and Chiang Kai-shek sold the people's China and the Chinese people. After the deal was completed, American imperialism bought a loyal and filial puppet emperor, and Chiang Kai-shek bought a large number of killing weapons to suppress the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, especially to attack the peaceful and democratic liberated areas, attempting to bind 450 million people as slaves. Everyone knows that a transaction with no capital involved will definitely continue and will not stop automatically. That is to say, today's China is once again facing a \"July 7th\" crisis. If the people of the whole country do not summon the national spirit of resisting Japanese imperialism to resist American imperialism, and do not summon the strong force of punishing Wang Jingwei to punish Chiang Jingwei, then the blood shed in the eight years of the War of Resistance will have been shed in vain, and the souls of the millions of martyrs will become ghosts without offerings.\n\nAt such a critical moment, shouldn't every person save the country?\n\nThe Communist Party of China and the China Democratic League, representing the people of all classes, have taken on the great task of saving the country from peril. Chiang Kai-shek has not yet been able to fully carry out his treacherous schemes and do as he pleases, precisely because of the combined efforts of the CCP and the Democratic League to stop him.\n\nMartyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were important leaders of the Democratic League and important representatives of the people. They had every right to speak for the people. Chiang Kai-shek acted as an accomplice, betrayed the country completely, and they walked out of their studies to call for saving the country. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war and massacred soldiers and civilians. They advocated justice and strove for peace. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek practiced dictatorial rule and enslaved the people. They insisted on democracy and opposed dictatorship. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek destroyed the national economic lifeline and let American imperialism seize the lives of the Chinese people. They refused to be enslaved and demanded economic construction and the development of capitalism. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? Chiang Kai-shek forced and lured innocent youths to take the wrong path, to engage in the despicable profession of secret agents and become fascist lackeys. They could not bear to sit idly by, and they cried out loudly, pointing out the path to enlightenment and saving countless youths in thought. Was this something that deserved to be killed for? What the two martyrs did was a thousand times over undeserving of being killed. There is no doubt about that. Then, Chiang Kai-shek, who killed the two martyrs, deserves to be killed a thousand times over, also without a doubt.\n\nOh, two martyrs! Rest assured! The Chinese people will avenge you! The time for Chiang Kai-shek's self-destruction is not far off. He fans the flames of poison, and we will overcome him with righteousness; he employs tricks and schemes, and we will break him with truth; he surrenders to American imperialism, and we will defeat him with the vast people; he finally launches a war of national betrayal, seeking a slim chance of survival, and we will stop him with a war of national salvation. Our democratic forces are surging and more than sufficient. Chiang Kai-shek's schemes are exhausted, and he is taking risks, only able to make a desperate struggle. Who will be the final victor? Does it still need to be explained?\n\nSleep peacefully, two martyrs! You are democratic warriors, your reputations will be immortal, and at your graves, the people will erect monuments to the martyrs who died for their country, to commemorate you forever. Look! In the distance, there is a large pile of dung, with a stinking bone buried inside. In front of the dung heap, there is a stubborn stone, on which is written \"Shanghai gangster, leader of the assassination squad, stock exchange speculator, special-grade warlord, number one traitor and country seller, head of the secret service, public enemy and tyrant, Chiang Kai-shek, puppet emperor of American imperialism, buried here.\" Not far away, another pile of dung buries Wang Jingwei, the puppet emperor of Japanese imperialism. These two piles of dung forever represent the crimes of the landlord and comprador classes. Sleep peacefully, two martyrs! You are forever worthy of pride!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李公朴闻一多两烈士哀辞\n范文澜\n1946-08-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李公朴闻一多两烈士哀辞\n    范文澜\n    李公朴闻一多两烈士被汉奸卖国贼蒋介石惨杀了。两烈士的鲜血，灌注到中国人民反美帝反奸贼的猛火堆里，光焰更是万丈高了。两烈士瞑目吧！你们正义的鲜血，决不会白流的。\n    近百年来，地主买办阶级里产生大汉奸卖国贼，最著名的如曾国藩、李鸿章、袁世凯、段祺瑞之流，把中国卖得差不多，但比之蒋介石那样干脆而彻底的出卖，却是小巫见大巫，反而算不得大奸大贼了。可以相比的只有汪精卫，好一对奸贼群中的难兄难弟！\n    蒋介石企图掠夺抗日战争的全部果实，永远保持其法西斯独裁，悍然出卖中国的一切，向美帝求援。他把天空也卖了，把海面也卖了，把内河也卖了，把海关也卖了，凡可以卖的都卖了。他还觉得不够，还出卖所谓“最后决定权”。换句话说，就是出卖中国的全部政权，使中国变成美帝的菲律滨，使中国人民变成美帝的黑奴，他自己因此“荣任”美帝的儿皇帝。这个集罪恶之大成的大奸大贼，自以为得计，妄图迫促中共代表团同意他的“荣任”，碰了大钉子以后，拿出一张所谓马帅的王牌来吓人。这真是“不知人间有羞耻事”的标本，如果想在他的头脑里找出一个耻字，那比水底捞月还难，因为耻的影子他也没有，不管他经常大叫特叫“礼义廉耻”。\n    美蒋进行买卖，双方都不掏本钱。美帝出卖的是准备投海的剩余军火，蒋介石出卖的是人民的中国和中国的人民。买卖成交以后，美帝买得忠孝双全的儿皇帝一个，蒋介石买得大批杀人凶器，用来镇压蒋家统治区的人民，特别是进攻和平民主的解放区，企图捆缚一万万四千万人民做奴隶。谁也知道，不掏本钱的买卖，一定要继续下去，不会自动停止的。那就是说，今天的中国，又一次面临“七七”危机，全国人民不拿出反抗日帝的民族精神来反抗美帝，不拿出膺惩汪精卫的坚强力量来膺惩蒋精卫，那么，八年抗日的鲜血将成空流，千百万殉国英魂将成不血食之鬼。\n    在这样严重的关头，每一个人民是不是应该救国呢？\n    中国共产党、中国民主同盟代表全国各阶层人民，担当起挽救危亡的大任。蒋介石至今还不能售其奸计，为所欲为，就是依靠中共、民盟的合力阻止。\n    李公朴闻一多两烈士是民盟重要负责人，也是人民的重要代表人，他们有完全权利替人民讲话。蒋介石为虎作伥，彻底卖国，他们走出书房，号呼救国，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石发动内战，屠杀军民，他们主张正义，力争和平，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石独夫专政，奴役人民，他们坚持民主，反对独裁，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石断送全国经济命脉，让美帝抓住中国人民的生命，他们拒绝奴化，要求经济建设，发展资本主义，这是该杀的事么？蒋介石迫诱无辜青年，走入邪路，执行特务贱业，充当法西斯走狗，他们不忍坐视，大声疾呼，指示光明大道，在思想上拯救了无数青年，这是该杀的事么？两烈士所做所为，千不该杀万不该杀，是毫无疑问的，那么，杀两烈士的蒋介石，千该杀万该杀，也是毫无疑问的了。\n    两烈士呵！你们安心吧！中国人民会替你们报仇雪恨的！蒋介石自毙的时期不远了。他煽毒焰，我们以正义克之，他施鬼蜮，我们以真理破之；他投美帝，我们以广大人民胜之；他最后发动卖国战，寻求万一的活路，我们以救国战制止之。我们民主力量声势蓬勃，沛然有余，蒋介石计穷智竭，挺而走险，只能作绝望的挣扎，谁是最后胜利者，难道还要说明么？\n    两烈士安睡吧！你们是民主战士，你们的名誉将永垂不朽，你们的墓前，人民要树立殉国烈士之碑，永远纪念你们。看吧！你们的遥远处，有一大堆粪土，里面埋着一副臭骨头，粪土堆前一块顽石，上面写着“上海青皮、暗杀队队长、交易所投机商人、特等军阀、头号汉奸卖国贼、特务总头子、民贼独夫、美帝儿皇帝蒋介石埋尸处”。相距不远，另一粪土堆埋着日帝儿皇帝汪精卫。这两堆粪土，永远表示地主买办阶级的罪恶。两烈士安睡吧！你们是永远值得骄傲的！"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 4th: The Rehe People's Special Court publicly tried the three major traitorous war criminals on the 23rd of last month: Sun Baifang, the puppet governor of Rehe Province, Li Baohua, the puppet director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Xu Mingzhe, the chief of the Security Section of the puppet Police Department. They were sentenced to death in court and escorted to the \"Tomb of Ten Thousand People,\" where anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians were massacred by the enemy and puppets in the past, to be executed by firing squad. During the fourteen years of Japanese and puppet Manchukuo rule, Sun and the other two traitors not only faithfully implemented the Japanese policy of destroying China, but also confessed to being accomplices who offered advice. Sun rose from a puppet county magistrate to the puppet governor of Sanjiang Province with the rank of Fifth Class Medal. He suppressed and bloodily washed the anti-Japanese allied forces of Generals Zhou Baozhong and Zhao Shangzhi, helping the enemy complete the construction of the \"Northeast Defense Line,\" – the Japanese immigration plan of 206,000 people and the looting of 600,000 mu of land from the people; 151.2 million catties of grain and 100 million yuan were forcibly collected in two and a half years; 250,000 \"Manchukuo soldiers\" and 108,000 laborers were conscripted; and he advised the Japanese to use \"appeasement\" to strangle the underground movement of the Sanjiang base area of the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces. The \"Tonghe Incident\" in 1944 was Sun's most vicious \"masterpiece.\" At that time, the 300 people who were arrested broke out of prison and armed themselves by breaking into the enemy's armory. The enemy \"suppressed\" the mountains several times to no avail. Sun went to the mountains to deceive the anti-Japanese righteous people to return home, causing the 300 armed people to fall back into prison. Last year, when the Eighth Route Army marched into Rehe West and Rehe South, and the enemy's \"Southwest Defense First Line\" rule was shaken, Sun was transferred to the post of puppet governor of Rehe Province to suppress the local people. Li Baohua had close ties with Lin Yixiu Xiong, the chief of the Japanese Qiqihar Special Service Agency, and Feng Yi, the chief of the General Affairs Department of Heilongjiang, before and after the \"September 18th Incident.\" Since 1932, he had served as the chief of the Department of Civil Affairs of the puppet Longjiang Province, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs of the puppet Tonghua Province, the Counselor of the General Affairs Department of the puppet State Council, and the director of the Department of Industry of the puppet Jinzhou Province. In 1944, while serving as the puppet director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Rehe Province in the \"Southwest Defense First Line,\" he personally planned the so-called \"Down the Mountain Movement.\" At that time, the people of Rehe West and Rehe South opposed the enemy's policy of gathering families and villages into human circles and fled into the mountains. Li personally went to puppet Beijing to raise thousands of old clothes to lure some people back into the tribes, completing the enemy's conspiracy to gather families that could not be achieved by force, facilitating the enemy's rule and exploitation, and increasing the difficulty of the Eighth Route Army's anti-Japanese activities. In 1944, Li forcibly conscripted 130,000 laborers for the enemy in Rehe. In the past, the enemy could only forcibly levy 4 million taels of opium in Rehe. After Li offered the advice of \"forcibly levying according to mu of land,\" it suddenly increased to 6 million taels. Xu Mingzhe served as a Japanese spy for 21 years. He had been active in Lushun, Dalian, Gongzhuling and other places since 1925. After the \"September 18th Incident,\" he worked in the puppet Shenyang Police Department collecting anti-Japanese intelligence. Later, he entered the enemy's \"Central Police School\" and the Japanese Ministry of Interior Police Station for \"advanced studies.\" In 1940, he went to Rehe to deal with the Eighth Route Army's Jireliao Advance Army. He personally went to Fengtian and Chiryu to serve as puppet county magistrate and direct the internal special service work. In mid-March 1941, he reported and arrested more than 200 good people. He was deeply trusted by the Japanese and was promoted to the chief of the Security Section of the puppet Rehe Police Department in June last year. After the liberation of Rehe, Sun, Li, and other traitors were arrested by our democratic government in November. After ten months of investigation and interrogation, the evidence was conclusive. Sun and the other three traitors also confessed that they deserved to die ten thousand times. The democratic government immediately executed the three criminals. The people throughout Rehe Province clapped their hands and cheered upon hearing the news.\n\nZhangjiakou, 2nd: Feng Yu Yan, a judge of the puppet Mengjiang Supreme Court, and Huang Shouli, the puppet president of the Zhangjiakou Municipal District Court, were tried by the Higher Court of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. On the 28th of last month, the Higher Court announced that, according to the revised regulations for punishing traitors, Feng and Huang were sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. Their traitorous property was confiscated according to law. Feng Yuyan was originally from Fangshan, Hebei. He was originally the president of the Nationalist Party's Zhangbei and Wanquan District Courts. After the Anti-Japanese War, he defected to the enemy and presided over puppet judicial and administrative affairs, successively serving as the president of the puppet courts in Zhangyuan and Zhangbei, the chief of the Higher Procuratorate of puppet Mengjiang, the director of the puppet Judicial Training Institute, and a judge of the puppet Supreme Court. He was deeply trusted by the Japanese and was once hailed as the \"only qualified judge\" in the puppet Mengjiang judicial circle. Huang Shouli was from Jian'ou, Fujian. Before the war, he was a judge of the Nationalist Party's Suiyuan District Court. After the Anti-Japanese War, he defected to the enemy and served as a judge of the Judicial Bureau of the puppet Suiyuan Maintenance Association, the president and judge of the puppet courts in Datong and other places, and the president of the puppet Zhangjiakou Municipal District Court. He was rewarded by the enemy with medals such as \"Establishing\" and \"Judiciary.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 热河人民公审战犯  巨奸孙柏芳等被枪决  伪蒙疆最高法院推事被处徒刑  认贼作父狞笑几时卖国求荣难逃法网\n\n1946-08-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　热河人民公审战犯\n    巨奸孙柏芳等被枪决\n    伪蒙疆最高法院推事被处徒刑\n    认贼作父狞笑几时卖国求荣难逃法网\n    【新华社承德四日电】热河人民特别法庭于上月二十三日公审伪热河省长孙柏芳、伪民生厅长李葆华、伪警务厅保安科长徐明遮等三大汉奸战犯，当庭判处死刑，押赴昔日敌伪屠杀抗战军民的万人墓前执行枪决。孙等三逆在日寇与伪满统治十四年中，不但忠实执行日寇灭华政策，而且自供是献计帮凶者。孙逆从伪县长等职调升为五级勋爵的伪三江省长，曾镇压与血洗周保中、赵尚志等将军之抗日联军，帮助敌人完成了“东北国防线”的建筑，——日寇廿万六千人的移民与掠夺民间六十万亩土地计划；二年半中强征粮食十五万一千二百万斤，款一万万元；“满洲抽兵”二十五万名与劳工十万八千名；并献计日寇以“宣抚怀柔”绞杀抗日联军三江根据地的地下运动。一九四四年的“通河事件”便是孙逆最恶毒的“杰作”。当时被捕的三百人民越狱起义打破敌寇军械库武装了自己，敌寇数次进山“讨伐”无效，孙逆竟亲赴山林欺骗抗日义民回家，使三百武装人民重陷囹圄。去年八路军挺进热西热南，敌“西南国防第一线”统治动摇时，孙逆又调任伪热河省长，镇压当地人民。李逆葆华，在“九一八”前后与敌齐齐哈尔特务机关长林逸秀雄、黑龙江总务厅长峰一等交往甚密，从一九三二年起历任伪龙江省民生厅科长、伪通化省民生厅长、伪国务院总务厅参事官、伪锦州省实业厅长等职。一九四四年，在“西南国防第一线”任伪热河省民生厅长期间，即亲自策划所谓“下山运动”。当时，热西热南人民反对敌人集家并村的人圈政策逃入深山，李逆即亲赴伪京募集数千旧衣诱骗一部分人民回入部落，完成日寇武力所不能达到的集家阴谋，便利日寇统治榨取，增加八路军抗日活动的困难。一九四四年，李逆在热河为敌寇强征了十三万劳工。敌寇往年在热河只能强征四百万两大烟，经李逆献计“以配给按亩强征”后，竟突增至六百万两。徐明遮当了二十一年日本特务，他从民国十四年起即在旅顺、大连、公主岭等地活动。“九一八”后，在伪沈阳警察厅任搜集抗日情报工作，后入敌寇“中央警察学校”及日本内务警察所“深造”，一九四○年到热河，对付八路军冀热辽挺进军，曾亲到丰田、雏龙当伪县长指挥内线特务工作；一九四一年三月中旬，即检举逮捕二百余善良人民；深得日寇信任，于去年六月升伪热河警察厅保安科长。热河解放后，孙李等逆于十一月为我民主政府逮捕，经十个月的调查审讯，证据确凿，孙等三逆亦自认罪该万死，民主政府即将该三犯明正典刑。热省全境人民闻讯莫不拍手称快。\n    【张家口二日电】伪蒙疆最高法院推事驾逆毓颜，伪张市地方法院院长黄逆守理，经晋察冀边区高等法院开庭审判后，上月二十八日由高等法院宣布，根据修正汉奸惩治条例判处冯黄二逆各有期徒刑十五年，褫夺公权十年，逆产依法没收。按冯逆毓颜系河北房山人，原为国民党张北、万全等地方法院院长，抗战后投敌主持伪司法行政事宜，先后充任张垣、张北等伪法院院长，伪蒙疆高等检查厅厅长，伪司法养成所所长，伪最高法院推事等职，深得日寇信任，曾被誉为伪蒙疆司法界“唯一合格的法官”。黄逆守理系福建建瓯人，战前任国民党绥远地方法院推事，抗战后投敌，任伪绥远维持会司法局推事和大同等地伪法院院长、推事，伪张市地方法院院长等职，曾被敌奖励“肇建”“司法”等奖章。"

    "content": "U.S. Troops Should Not Occupy China\n    Zeng Yanxiu\n\n    Recently, the U.S. authorities have made several responsible statements regarding the U.S. mission in China, which is the official response to the demands made by Comrade Mao Zedong and Mr. Song Qingling on behalf of the Chinese people over the past month, calling for the U.S. to cease all military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and withdraw all U.S. troops stationed in China. Regarding the former, according to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Washington on June 25th: \"A U.S. State Department spokesman reiterated that the stationing of U.S. troops in China is at the request of the Chinese government for the purpose of repatriating Japanese troops in China. The sole purpose of the U.S. military in China is to achieve this.\" Regarding the latter, according to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from Washington on July 23rd, a State Department spokesman commented on Mr. Song Qingling's recent statement, saying: \"The purpose of the U.S. military in China is solely to assist China in completing the withdrawal of Japanese troops from its territory.\" As is well known, Mr. Truman made a similar statement in his China policy statement last December and in the agreement of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. In the Three Foreign Ministers' agreement, the U.S. side stated: \"The important task of the U.S. military is to implement the terms of the Japanese surrender, that is, to disarm the Japanese army and withdraw the Japanese army. When these tasks are completed, or when the Chinese government is able to carry out these tasks without U.S. military assistance, the U.S. military will withdraw from China.\" However, the actions of the U.S. military in China over the past fourteen months have been inconsistent with and contrary to these statements, because: First, more Japanese prisoners are concentrated in Central and Southern China, but not a single U.S. combat troop has landed there. According to the final announcement by the U.S. military headquarters in Shanghai on the 15th of this month, only 550,000 Japanese prisoners of war (including Japanese nationals) were concentrated at ports in North China for repatriation. The North American army stationed in China has 53,000 troops, and it has been repatriating for ten months, with an average of only one Japanese person repatriated per person per month. Isn't this a huge joke?! Second, the repatriation work, according to the U.S. announcement, has long been handed over to the Kuomintang government and the Japanese side for self-management. On July 19th, Brigadier General Wharton, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, publicly announced that \"the U.S. Marine Corps has transferred the matter of repatriating Japanese troops to their home country to the Chinese government for handling.\" On February 9th, the U.S. military authorities in Shanghai announced that from the end of February, \"all ships sending Japanese back to their country will be driven by the Japanese themselves.\" Most of the ships are also Japanese ships, and the U.S. only has \"tank landing ships participating in the same work.\" These simple points are enough to illustrate the true picture of the U.S. military presence in China.\n    No matter how the U.S. authorities delay the repatriation work, according to a dispatch from United Press Shanghai on the 15th: \"The U.S. military announced that the work of sending Japanese people back to their country from mainland China has been completed, including 2.2 million Japanese...all of whom have been sent back to their country.\" Therefore, the situation has now undergone a fundamental change. Although the U.S. has not mentioned a word about leaving tens of thousands of Japanese prisoners to engage in civil war, all the pretexts for the U.S. military's presence in China have finally been lost. If the U.S. military does not immediately withdraw from China, the Chinese people will have sufficient reason not to call this army an allied army, but only an occupying army like MacArthur's stationed in Tokyo. If it is wrong to say so, then the U.S. authorities must declare that all the previous solemn statements of the U.S. side are invalid, or transport the Japanese army from Japan to China again. The fact is that the U.S. occupation of Japan is relaxing day by day, while the occupation of China, which is not called occupation, is intensifying day by day! The U.S. has only 200,000 occupation troops stationed in Japan, and MacArthur has stated that he will reduce it by another 50,000, leaving only 150,000. And how many are the occupation troops in China that are not called occupation troops? The Marine Corps in North China alone has more than 53,000 troops. According to the Associated Press report in the Tianjin English Evening News on July 1st, there are 90,000 troops (plus two huge fleets, a huge air force, a huge U.S. military headquarters, a huge U.S. military advisory group...etc.). Adding these together, is it more or less than 150,000? Only the U.S. authorities themselves know. Judging from their actions, the two armies are not without similarities. For example, the U.S. military in Tokyo prevents mass demonstrations, armed guards the Japanese Emperor's palace and the Prime Minister's residence, and does not allow people to petition, claiming to protect \"order,\" etc. In China, doesn't the U.S. military also occupy Chinese ports, fortresses, railways, and airports, and feel interested in the \"security\" of Chinese cities (such as Qingdao)? The fleet removes its gun covers and aims at the chests of the Chinese people, practicing fortress assault battles, etc., all the way to the Anpingzhen Incident in eastern Hebei on July 29th, in which dozens of U.S. troops launched an armed attack on our liberated areas. In Japan, they \"protect order,\" and in China, they \"maintain security.\" What are the other differences besides this? The current situation is that the United States has not only reduced China to the status of its Latin American colony, but has also reduced China to the status of Iceland, which has a population of only 100,000 and no national defense, because in these two places, the United States has openly violated its contracts and continued to station troops, and has disregarded the sovereignty of these two countries in the same way.\n    Originally, before Japan surrendered, we never opposed the landing of U.S. troops in China, and we very much welcomed this landing, joining hands with the Chinese army and people to drive out the Japanese invaders. At that time, the Chinese people were eagerly waiting, but as a result, not a single U.S. troop landed. After Japan surrendered for more than a month, the U.S. military, in the posture of victors, massively descended on China, using the excuse of \"repatriation\" to station in China for ten months. Now that the repatriation has been completed, the U.S. military has lost the reason to stay in China for even a minute longer. If the U.S. authorities still want to maintain a little diplomatic credibility, if they still want to maintain a little friendship with the 450 million Chinese people, they should fulfill this promise and immediately withdraw all U.S. troops in China.\n    We would like to solemnly tell the U.S. authorities that the international reputation that the late President Roosevelt established for the United States has now plummeted. On May 20th, United Press reported that several New York newspapers published editorials that day, saying: \"Our country (the United States) is the richest, best-fed, and most disliked country in the world today.\" With the U.S. authorities' current behavior in China, the Chinese people really cannot \"like\" it. If the Chinese people \"liked\" the U.S. authorities' current behavior in China, they would have \"liked\" the Japanese invaders' behavior in China long ago, and there would have been no need for the War of Resistance. People with clear heads in the U.S. authorities should deeply understand this and reflect it in their China policy.\n    Finally, let us shout to the people of China and the United States: We are not a defeated country! We are not Iceland! U.S. troops should not occupy China!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美军不应占领中国\n曾彦修\n1946-08-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美军不应占领中国\n    曾彦修\n    最近美国当局对于美国驻华任务，有几次负责的声明，也即对于毛泽东同志和宋庆龄先生月来代表全国人民要求美国停止一切军事援蒋撤退美国在华一切驻军声明的正式回答。对于前者，据中央社华盛顿六月二十五日的专电说：“美国务院发言人重申在华美军之驻扎，系应中国政府之请求，用以遣送在华日军者。美军在华之唯一目的即在于此。”对于后者，据美新闻处华盛顿七月二十三日电，国务院发言人当日评论宋庆龄先生日前的声明时称：“美军驻华的目的，也仅仅限于协助中国完成其领土上日军之撤退。”如众所周知，杜鲁门氏在其去年十二月对华政策声明与美苏英三外长会议协议上，也曾作过同样性质的声明。在三外长协议上美方声称：“美军的重要任务是执行日本投降条件，即是解除日军武装与撤退日军的责任。这些任务一旦完结时，或在中国政府没有美军援助能够执行这些任务时，美军即撤离中国。”但是过去的十四月以来，在华美军的行为就是一直与这些声明不符与违背的。因为：第一，华中华南同样集中有更多的日俘，但并未有一个作战美军登陆。其集中在华北港口遣送的日俘（日侨也在内），据本月十五日美军总部在上海最后宣布的也只有五十五万人。而驻华北美军则有五万三千，到现在已经遣送了十个月，每人每月平均只遣送了一个日本人。这不是天大的笑话吗？！第二，遣俘工作，据美方宣布，早已移交国民党政府和日人方面自行办理。今年七月十九日，美驻华陆战队参谋长华顿准将已公开宣布“美陆战队已将日军遣返本国之事项移交中国政府办理”。二月九日，美军当局又在上海宣布：自二月底起，“所有遣送日人返国之船只，一律改由日人自行驾驶”。船舶也绝大部分是日本船，美方只有“坦克登陆轮艘参加进行同样工作”。这简单的几点，已经足够说明美军驻华的事实真象了。\n    不管美方当局把遣俘工作如何拖延，据合众社上海十五日电：“美军宣布自中国本部遣送日人返国工作已完成，其中包括二百二十万日本人……皆已遣送归国。”因此，现在的情况已发生根本的变化了，虽然美方对于留下××万余日俘从事内战一字未提，现在美军驻华的一切借口，已最后失去了。如果美军再不立即从中国撤退，中国人民将有充分理由不把这种军队叫做盟军，而只能叫做和麦克阿瑟驻在东京一样的占领军了。如果这样说是错的，那么美国当局就必须声明上属美方历次庄严的声明全部不作数，或者把日军再从日本运到中国来。事实是：美国对日本的占领是在一天天地放松，而对中国的不被称为占领的占领，则是一天天的加紧了！美国派驻日本的占领军，只有二十万，麦克阿瑟已声明还要减少五万，就只剩十五万。而在中国的不叫做占领军的占领军又是多少呢？单在华北的海军陆战队，就有五万三千余人，据天津英文晚报七月一日美联社消息，则有九万名（还有两个庞大的舰队，庞大的空军，庞大的美军总部，庞大的美国军事顾问团……等等）。把这些加在一起，究竟比十五万多还是少？就只有美国当局自己知道。再从他们的行动上看，两军也不是没有相同之点。例如：美军在东京阻止群众示威，武装保卫日皇皇宫和首相官邸，不准人民前去请愿，声称保卫“秩序”等等，在中国美军不是也同样的占领中国的港口要塞、铁道、机场，对中国城市（如青岛）的“治安”感觉兴趣？舰队脱下炮衣，对准中国人民的胸膛，演习堡垒攻击战等等，一直到酿成七月二十九日的冀东安平镇事件，美军数十人向我解放区武装进攻，在日本“保卫秩序”，在中国“维持治安”，除此以外，其他的区别在那里？现在的情形是：美国已不但把中国降到它的殖民地的拉丁美洲的地位，而且也已把中国降到只有十万人口的没有国防的冰岛的地位了，因为在这两个地方，美国如出一辙地公开违约继续驻军，如出一辙地蔑视这两个国家的主权。\n    本来，在日本投降之前，我们从没有反对过美军在华登陆，而且十分欢迎这种登陆，与中国军民并肩驱逐日寇。那时中国人民望眼欲穿，结果，美军却一个也没有登陆。等到日本投降了一个多月以后，美军反以胜利者的姿态，大量君临中国，借口“遣俘”在中国驻了十个月，现在遣俘已经完成，美军即使再在中国留驻一分钟的理由也失去了。美国当局如果还愿意维持一点外交信誉，如果还愿保持一点与四万万五千万中国人民的友谊，就应当实践这个诺言，立即撤退一切在华美军。\n    我们愿意正告美国当局，故罗斯福总统为美国所建立起的国际声誉，现在是已经一落千丈了。今年五月二十日合众社报导当天纽约若干报纸的社论说：“我国（美国）是今天世界上最富的、吃得最好的、人家最不喜欢的国家。”像美国当局现在在华的行为，中国人民实在无法“喜欢”。如果中国人民“喜欢”了美国当局现在在华的行为，他们老早便“喜欢”了日本侵略者在华的行为，用不着抗战了。这一点，美国当局中头脑清醒的人，是应当深深了解并反映到它的对华政策中去的。\n    最后，让我们向全中国和全美国人民高呼：我们不是战败国！我们不是冰岛！美军不应当占领中国！"

While Jiang Jieshi was sitting in Guling directing the nationwide civil war, his Minister of Propaganda, Peng Xuepei, made a brief statement at a press banquet in Guling on the 2nd, asking the Chinese people to \"give him (referring to Jiang Jieshi) a little time.\" (Central News Agency, 2nd). The reporter commented that Peng Xuepei's statement indicated that Jiang Jieshi had encountered insurmountable difficulties in conducting a large-scale civil war, and was unable to realize his dream of \"victory.\" Jiang Jieshi had expected to eliminate the Central Plains troops of the Chinese Communist Party in a short period of time and achieve a \"stunning victory.\" However, what was stunning was not only the breakthrough of Jiang's encirclement and annihilation troops, but also the fact that in just over a month, Jiang's army had lost more than 70,000 people and a lot of American weapons, which is also a stunning figure. Under these circumstances, Peng Xuepei could not help but shout, \"No one is more anxious than the government, no one is more anxious than Chairman Jiang.\" However, since Jiang Jieshi and his followers are so \"anxious,\" do they have any remorse? Peng Xuepei's remarks gave a negative answer: \"But it always takes a little time,\" \"Chinese affairs have to be slower due to conditional relations.\" The \"little time\" Jiang Jieshi needs is not for peace negotiations, but for a military solution, that is to say: \"It won't work to fight quickly, let me have more time to fight slowly!\" The Chinese people will undoubtedly give the most accurate answer to such a request from the Jiang Jieshi ruling clique: The Chinese people have given you too much time! Your perverse acts over the past nineteen years have only increased, and your dark rule far exceeds that of Empress Dowager Cixi and Yuan Shikai, unprecedented in Chinese history. The truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference have given you opportunities to repent and reform, but you have torn them up. The Chinese people have given you too much time, and today, whether you fight quickly or slowly, the Chinese people will absolutely not allow it! You should immediately pull back from the brink!

    "content": "[By Our Correspondent in Yangcheng] Since February, Yicheng County has undergone an earth-shaking peasant emancipation movement. Except for eighteen small mountain villages accounting for 0.5% of the population, the entire county has launched struggles against traitors and bullies or rent reduction and debt liquidation campaigns, destroying the feudal landlord and tyrant rule. The class composition of the rural areas has undergone drastic changes. According to statistics from early June, peasant households that have gained the fruits of struggle account for more than 83% of the total number of households in the second and fourth districts. Although the third district is an old liberated area, it also accounts for 50.2%. In total, 12,493 households in the county have gained from the struggle. All extreme poverty has been eliminated in the second district, with 315 of the 494 tenant farmers rising to the level of middle peasants, and 120 rising to the level of poor peasants. 944 poor peasant households have risen to the level of middle peasants, and 36 have risen to the level of rich peasants. 51 middle peasant households have also risen to the level of rich peasants. In Shangwu Village in the district, out of 37 tenant farmer households, 15 have risen to poor peasants, 20 have risen to middle peasants, and 1 has risen to rich peasants; only 1 household remained unchanged. The original 95 poor peasant households saw 42 rise to middle peasants and 6 rise to rich peasants. The number of rich peasants has surged from 16 to 42. In the third district, of the original 201 tenant farmer households, 105 have now obtained land, and 96 are farming public land, no longer subject to exploitation by landlords. Of the 7,546 poor peasant households, 1,809 have risen in status. The number of middle peasants has surged from the original 6,534 to 10,163. All 67 extremely poor households in Pengsi Village in the district have been eliminated: 51 have risen to poor peasants, and 16 have risen to middle peasants. The number of middle peasants has increased from 43 to 100. In the fourth district, of the original 1,523 extremely poor households, only 83 now remain. This change has brought infinite joy to the vast number of peasants. Everyone says, \"The world has changed!\" The masses in Shangwu Village often recall the tragic history of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" and \"Eight Great Vajras\" (referring to the village's ruling clique) and their bloody rule, during which 55 people died unnaturally, and most peasant families suffered from cold, hunger, or fled from famine. They unanimously celebrated today's new life, saying, \"I never thought we could have this day!\" \"This is truly emancipation!\" The village has now established a strong peasant association of more than 1,300 people, and held a grand demonstration parade during its founding.\n    [By Our Correspondent in Yangcheng] The movement of speaking out about suffering and seeking revenge, and of rent reduction and debt liquidation, in Fushan County, has been widely developed to all administrative villages and 85% of natural villages. Among them, 20% of the villages have already shifted to production. This movement began after clearing up the unfavorable situation since mid-March, in which the direction was unclear, the style of monopolizing everything and not letting go was apparent, resulting in the stagnation of the movement, the isolation of a few advanced masses, and the landlords taking the opportunity to counterattack. At that time, it was clearly proposed to vigorously carry out speaking out about suffering and seeking revenge, and quickly transition to rent and interest reduction. It is necessary to let go and mobilize the majority of the masses and strike at the worst rulers. This has made cadres and the masses active from being depressed. The county-wide, vigorous struggle quickly unfolded. The phenomenon of indiscriminate struggle against all objects in the past has been automatically stopped by the masses. The vast number of middle peasants have consciously joined the wave of struggle and played an active role, many of whom have already joined the peasant association, accounting for more than a quarter of the new members of the peasant association. One-third of middle peasant families (approximately 3,340 households) have received one-tenth of all the fruits of struggle: totaling 2,600 mu of land, 4,100 shi of grain, 155 head of cattle and donkeys, etc. This has greatly improved the mood of the vast number of middle peasants, who have realized the truth that \"working peasants are one family.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 万二千余户农民获得斗争果实  翼城贫中农生活上升  浮山中农卷入斗争群运迅速开展\n\n1946-08-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　万二千余户农民获得斗争果实\n    翼城贫中农生活上升\n    浮山中农卷入斗争群运迅速开展\n    【本报阳城讯】翼城经过二月份以来翻天覆地的农民翻身运动，全县除了占人口百分之○·五的十八个小山庄外，全部掀起反奸霸或减租清债斗争，摧垮了封建地主恶霸统治，农村的阶级成份已起了急剧变化。据六月初统计，获得斗争果实的农家，在二、四区各占总户数百分之八十三以上。三区虽为老区，也占百分之五十点二，全县合计获得斗争者共有一万二千四百九十三户。二区赤贫全部消灭，四百九十四户佃农有三百一十五户上升为中农，一百二十户上升为贫农。贫农有九百四十四户升为中农，三十六户升为富农。中农也有五十一户升为富农。该区上吴村三十七户佃农，十五户升为贫农，二十户升为中农，一户升为富农，只有一户没动。贫农原有九十五户，四十二户升为中农，六户升为富农。富农由十六户激增到四十二户。三区原有佃农二百零一户，现在一百零五户获得土地，九十六户种着公田，都不再受地主的盘剥了。贫农七千五百四十六户，有一千八百零九户上升。中农由原来的六千五百三十四户激增至一万零一百六十三户。该区蓬司村原有六十七户赤贫全部消灭：五十一户升为贫农，十六户升为中农。中农由四十三户增至一百户。四区原有赤贫一千五百二十三户，现亦只剩八十三户了。这个变化给广大农民带来无穷的欢喜。人人都说：“世界变了样。”上吴村群众常常回忆着以前“四大天王”、“八大金刚”（均为该村统治集团）的血手魔刀统治时代，五十五人死于非命，大部农家冻饿或逃荒的悲惨史实，异口同声庆祝着今天的新生说：“真想不到能有今天！”“这可真是翻身了！”该村现已成立了一千三百余人的强大农会，并在成立时举行盛大示威游行。\n    【本报阳城讯】浮山县的诉苦复仇与减租清债运动，已经普遍发展到所有行政村与百分之八十五的自然村。其中有十分之二的村庄已转入生产。这次运动，是从三月中旬清算了过去的方向不明确、包办代替不放手作风，以及由此造成的运动停滞，少数先进群众孤立，地主趁机反攻的不利形势以后开始的。当时明确提出大力开展诉苦复仇，并很快转入减租减息。要放手发动群众的大多数，打击最坏的统治者。这使干部与群众都由苦闷而活跃起来。全县规模的轰轰烈烈的斗争，很快就展开了。过去的不择对象乱斗争现象，群众自动停止了。广大中农都自觉地卷入斗争浪潮，并起了积极作用，其中有很多已经加入农会，占农会新会员四分之一以上。有三分之一的中农家庭（约三三四○户），分得全部斗争果实的十分之一：计土地二千六百亩，粮食四千一百石，牛驴一百五十五头等。这使广大中农的情绪大大提高，都认识到“劳动农民是一家”的真理。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 5th. The CCP Central Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau Senior Cadre Meeting successfully concluded a few days ago. The central task of the meeting was to review mass movements, troop work, and financial work. During the discussion, Shuoxian County's report on boldly mobilizing the masses and Linxian County's report on the leadership style of the mass line served as typical examples. Zhang Chuyuan, the creator of the Jin-Sui Border Region's combination of labor and military affairs, reported on his work in one village, providing the conference with a highly educational demonstration. After analyzing the current international and domestic situation, Comrade He Long clearly pointed out two central tasks: First, to mobilize the masses to thoroughly reduce rent and interest rates, so that farmers can become masters of their own destiny, have land to cultivate, expand production, and increase grain and cloth production to solve the clothing and food problems of five million people. Second, to build a people's army, protect the fruits of victory, defend the border region, stop the civil war, and safeguard peace and democracy. In the discussion on mobilizing the masses, the meeting believed that the rent and interest reduction movement in the border region over the past nine years, especially since 1943, had achieved great results. After the great counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders last year, the newly recovered areas had largely carried out the work of anti-traitor liquidation, and some areas had launched rent reduction movements. Comrade Zhang Jiafu pointed out in his report that there were and still are many shortcomings in the work. In the interior, the main problem was the lack of clarity in policy and ideology, which damaged the interests of some middle peasants and excessively damaged the interests of some rich peasants, thus affecting the development of production. Another problem was the work style of taking over and forcing orders, which still seriously existed in some areas, also hindering the masses' genuine conscious movement. In the new areas, the main problem was the failure to seize the opportunity and lead the mass movement according to the needs of the masses, so that the development of the movement was not rapid, continuous, and universal enough.\n\nComrades He Long and Zhu Jingquan pointed out when reviewing the relationship between the army and the masses that the army violated the interests of the masses and should admit its mistakes to the masses and compensate for the losses suffered. When reviewing financial work, they criticized the purely financial viewpoint as a viewpoint of the old regime that was divorced from the masses. The conference especially pointed out that the correct financial work policy should be to develop production, first of all to develop the production of five million people, and at the same time to develop the production of organs, troops, and personnel. The conference decided to recommend to the government that the public grain for national construction must be reduced to at least one-third of the amount collected last year, and all old public grain debts that the poor are unable to pay should be completely exempted. Loaned grain and loans that cannot be repaid should also be reduced or exempted as appropriate, and agricultural loans, seedling loans, and textile loans should be issued in large quantities, using all methods and the greatest efforts to help the broad masses of people develop production and improve their lives. In terms of organs and troops, equal emphasis should be placed on production and thrift, advocating that everyone does their best, developing production in both aspects, carrying forward the tradition of hard work and arduous struggle, opposing speculation and taking shortcuts, and opposing corruption and waste, practicing strict economy, and cherishing manpower and materials. Comrade He Long especially called on all comrades to fight against all corrupt and wasteful elements, work hard to produce, practice thrift, and reduce the burden on the people.\n\nRegarding the issue of army work, Comrade Gan Siqi emphasized in his report the opposition to purely military viewpoints, and proposed that at present, the training of the army should be strengthened, the army should universally participate in mass movements, the construction of the militia should be strengthened, and preferential treatment for military dependents should be strengthened so that families can obtain land. He also called on local comrades in various places to take the same responsibility for this work. All the reports and discussions of the conference were permeated with the idea of serving the people, the style of the mass line, and the spirit of self-criticism. Many comrades conducted profound introspection. The conference especially called on the spirit of the senior cadre meeting to be brought to all parts of the country. Comrade He Long finally earnestly urged everyone to go deep into the rural areas and companies, carry out meticulous and arduous work, and truly mobilize the five million people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中央晋绥分局高干会议  检讨群运部队财经工作  贺龙同志谆谆叮嘱深入农村与连队艰苦工作\n\n1946-08-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中央晋绥分局高干会议\n    检讨群运部队财经工作\n    贺龙同志谆谆叮嘱深入农村与连队艰苦工作\n    【新华社兴县五日电】中共中央晋绥分局高级干部会议已于日前胜利闭幕，会议的中心任务为检讨群众运动、部队工作与财经工作。在讨论中，朔县关于大胆放手发动群众、临县关于群众路线的领导作风，曾作了典型报告，晋绥边区劳武结合的创造者张初元，报告了自己所做的一个村的工作。给大会以极富教育意义的示范。贺龙同志于分析国际国内目前形势后，即明确的指出两个中心工作：一是发动群众彻底减租减息，使农民翻身，有田可种，扩大生产增产粮食布匹，解决五百万人民的穿衣吃饭问题。二是建设人民的军队，保卫胜利果实，保卫边区，制止内战，保卫和平民主。在关于发动群众的讨论中，会议认为九年来特别是从四三年以来边区减租减息运动获得了很大成绩，在去年对日寇大反攻后，新收复的地区，大部分已经普遍进行了反奸清算工作，其中一部分地区已展开了减租运动。张稼夫同志在报告中指出工作中存在过而且尚存在着不少缺点，在内地则主要为政策思想不明确，损伤了一部分中农的利益，与过分的损伤了有些富农利益，因此影响了生产的发展。另一为包办代替强迫命令的作风，在某些地区尚严重存在，这也阻碍了群众真正的自觉运动。在新区主要是没有掌握时机，没按群众需要领导群众运动，使运动的发展不够迅速、连续与普遍。\n    贺龙同志和朱井泉同志在检讨军队与群众关系时，指出军队违犯了群众利益，应向群众承认错误及赔偿其所受损失。于检讨财经工作时，批评了单纯的财政观点是脱离群众的旧政权的观点。大会特别指出正确的财政工作的方针，应为发展生产，首先是发展五百万人民的生产，同时亦要发展机关部队人员的生产。大会决定向政府建议，建国公粮至少须减低至去年征收的三分之一，所有贫苦无力完纳的旧欠公粮，应一律豁免。旧欠而无力偿还之贷粮贷款亦应酌情免收，并大量发放农贷、青苗与纺织贷款，以一切方法用最大力量帮助广大人民发展生产，改善生活。在机关部队方面，以生产节约并重，提倡各尽其能，发展双方面的生产，发挥吃苦耐劳艰苦奋斗的传统，反对投机取巧，和借口生产侵犯群众利益，反对贪污浪费，厉行节约爱惜人力物力。贺龙同志特别号召所有同志与一切贪污浪费分子作斗争，努力生产节衣缩食，减轻人民负担。\n    关于军队工作问题，甘泗淇同志在报告中强调的反对了单纯的军事观点，并提出目前应加强军队的训练，军队普遍参加群众运动，加强民兵建设，加强优抗工作，使家属获得土地。并号召各地地方同志对这一工作必须同样负起责任来。大会全部报告和讨论是贯穿着为人民服务的思想、与群众路线的作风、与自我批评的精神，许多同志都进行了深刻的反省，大会特别号召把高干会的精神带到各地去。贺龙同志最后更谆谆叮嘱深入农村与连队，进行细密的艰苦工作，把五百万人民真正发动起来。"

    "content": "Peking University Summer留校员 Students Strengthen Current Affairs and Political Studies\n　　[News from Xingtai by our newspaper] Since Mr. Fan Wenlan, the president of Northern University, arrived at the school, and after classifying students by their level, implementing class assignments by department, and formally starting classes, the two months of education from May to July have yielded remarkable results from all aspects. The main manifestations are the rapid improvement of students' cultural level and the significant progress in theoretical understanding. Almost everyone's outlook has been renewed.\n　　Recently, most of the school's faculty, staff, and students, except for a portion who voluntarily participated in land reform teams to go to the countryside to help mobilize the masses, and those who took leave to return to their hometowns to visit relatives and retrieve belongings, are conducting summer remedial education. At a time when the situation is tense, and the Kuomintang fascists and the dictator Chiang Kai-shek are colluding with American imperialism, selling out the country, and launching a large-scale civil war, the school authorities discovered a tendency among students to emphasize culture and neglect the study of current affairs and politics. Therefore, the school's Secretary-General Luo Qing, Dean of Academic Affairs Wang Zhenhua, Deputy Director of Academic Affairs Guo Qianheng, Deputy Director of the School of Engineering Liu Danian, and the head teacher of the attached classes, Zhang Jinan, and four other teachers formed a five-person committee to rectify and promote summer learning. On July 23rd, a meeting of faculty and staff cadres was held to discuss this matter. At the meeting, the faculty and staff spoke enthusiastically. Mr. Yin Da, the deputy director of the library and a historian and archaeologist, pointed out that the continuous assassinations of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo by Chiang's fascists are a bloody suppression by the Jiang-US reactionaries against the Chinese people, coordinating with their signal to launch a large-scale civil war against the liberated areas nationwide. This bloody fact proves that we cannot calmly bury ourselves in long-term academic research. If there is no independent, peaceful, and democratic China, who will academic research serve in the future? In order to defend the liberated areas and aid the peace and democracy movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and to make everyone vigilant about the current situation, prepare and take action to resolutely respond to and support the call of President Fan and the five-person committee, he advocated immediately launching school-wide current affairs education and strengthening combat-oriented life. Mr. Yin Da's speech immediately aroused enthusiastic approval from the audience, especially from scholars Wang Jindi and Guan Taili, who had just arrived from Beiping. On the spot, they discussed and passed several resolutions on summer teaching and life rectification.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 5th: The East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, in view of the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries are launching a nationwide civil war and expanding their offensive against the Su-Wan and Shandong liberated areas, issued the \"Letter to Compatriots and Comrades on Thoroughly Crushing the Offensive of the Kuomintang Reactionaries and Striving for Victory in the Second Self-Defense War\" on August 1st, calling on the military and civilians in the entire East China liberated area to mobilize and crush the reactionaries' offensive. The document first pointed out that in order to achieve the happiness of the people in the liberated areas, the survival of compatriots in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, and to defend China's independence, peace, and democracy, it is necessary to resolutely defend ourselves and crush the reactionaries' offensive. It then put forward the current urgent tasks to the military and civilians in the entire East China liberated area: (1) Expand the patriotic united front, unite all peace-loving and democratic friendly army officers and soldiers, democratic figures, and compatriots across the country to fight against Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and traitorous policies! (2) Call on the vast number of officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang army to refuse internal war orders and stand on the side of the people; learn from the example of Generals Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, Liu Shanben and others! (3) All commanders and fighters of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army! Fight bravely, create combat heroes, and seize the Chiang army's American-equipped equipment to arm yourselves. Treat Kuomintang officers and soldiers who lay down their weapons with leniency, and warmly welcome and assist friendly troops who revolt. (4) Local armed forces should assist the main force in combat, and the main force should lead the militia to launch extensive guerrilla warfare. (5) All 1.5 million militiamen in East China should go to the front line to cooperate with the regular army in combat, and go to areas occupied by the Chiang army to help the people launch guerrilla warfare and sparrow warfare, capture armed Kuomintang secret agents, crack down on Chiang army troops who rob grain, protect the people's lives and property, protect the fruits of the people's liberation, and cooperate with the army to recapture towns, villages, railways, and mines occupied by the Chiang army. Those remaining in the rear should help self-defense forces stand guard, arrest spies, and consolidate the rear. (6) All the masses, working cadres, members of workers', peasants', youth, and women's organizations, and staff members of governments at all levels should help the people in the newly liberated areas quickly turn over, carry out large-scale production movements, further improve the people's lives, and ensure support for the front lines; personnel working in the war zone should organize the people to assist the army in a planned way.

    "content": "The Agony of Atomic Bomb Diplomacy\n　　Dù Bō\n\nAccording to the decision of the Potsdam Big Three to cooperate after the war to guarantee world peace and security, the United States had the obligation to publicly announce the secret of the atomic bomb to the world, in order to show its sincerity in guaranteeing world peace after the war. But unfortunately, the rulers of the gold-standard empire, after the end of the war, violated the friendly cooperation of the allied countries during the war, and disregarded the great contribution of the Red Army to the anti-fascist war of aggression. Before the Soviet Union had mastered atomic energy, they not only refused to place atomic energy under international control, but instead used it as a \"magic weapon\" in diplomacy, using it as a tool to bargain with the Soviet Union in international negotiations.\n\nOn August 7 last year, a U.S. aircraft dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. At that time, the United States mobilized almost all newspapers and radio stations across the country, and even President Truman personally issued a statement to publicize the power of the atomic bomb. At that time, some reactionary elements in the United States, such as Vandenberg and the Hearst newspapers, took the opportunity to hype up the invention and practical application of the atomic bomb, describing it as the arrival of \"the end of the world\" and the \"only reason\" for forcing Japan to surrender. They deliberately exaggerated its power and erased the iron fact that the Red Army's defeat of the Kwantung Army was the decisive factor in forcing Japan to surrender quickly, vainly attempting to create atomic bomb terror to threaten the Soviet Union to make concessions on various post-war issues.\n\nPrecisely because of this, over the past year, in coordination with the international situation of alternating tension and relaxation, the United States has conducted two atomic bomb tests, one after the United Nations General Assembly last year, which was dropped in New Mexico in the southern United States, and the other on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands on the first of last month. This test was held during the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, not long before the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy is that for this test, the United States mobilized more publicity personnel to visit. A month before the test, news was released and hyped up, such as \"the atomic bomb to be dropped this time will emit the heat and light of a thousand suns\" and \"Bikini will sink,\" which was sensationalizing. However, the results of the July 1 test not only failed to achieve the expected results, but on the contrary, gave people the feeling that the atomic bomb was \"nothing more than that.\" Bikini did not \"sink,\" and even the seventy-seven ships that served as the target of the atomic bomb were not destroyed. Goats were still chewing grass on the bombed warships, and fish were still swimming in the water. Commander Brandt, the commander-in-chief of the atomic bomb test, had to admit: \"The atomic bomb test was not as moving as the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. The loss of ships was far less than expected, and some of the pigs and sheep used for the experiment did not die.\" This test failed beyond the expectations of the U.S. authorities.\n\n42,000 people participated in this test, including naval personnel, scientists, technicians, and journalists, at a cost of more than 500 million US dollars. Although the test failed, U.S. officials have vowed to conduct another deep-water test soon. It can be seen that the American imperialists have not only not given up the sincerity of atomic bomb manufacturing, but are seeking to further improve it. When the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, President Truman once stated: \"We have engaged in this unprecedented scientific gamble with Germany, spending 2 billion US dollars and employing 120,000 people to engage in this work.\" But today, when German and Japanese fascism has collapsed, the US gamble has not stopped, and the \"bet\" seems to be even more generous. What is it for? As British Communist Party Secretary Pollitt said, this is still the United States' \"intimidation policy\" in diplomacy. This \"intimidation policy\" is consistent with the \"World Base Network Plan\" and \"Dollar Diplomacy\" that the United States is gradually implementing, and is an attempt to realize its ambition to dominate the world. However, the \"World Base Network Plan\" and \"Dollar Diplomacy\" are used to deal with the whole world, while the main target of the atomic bomb \"intimidation policy\" is the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviet Union has always maintained a calm and rational attitude towards the United States' \"intimidation policy\" of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union sincerely and firmly believes that the post-war world should be guided towards peace and security by the major powers, rather than towards mutual suspicion and war. Therefore, after this large-scale US test, Izakov, an observer for Pravda, only said with a regretful tone: \"Although the atomic bomb test did not bring the world to the end, the things it destroyed are more important than one or two old ships, namely, our trust.\" Obviously, the Soviet Union did not feel uneasy because of the United States' \"intimidation policy.\"\n\nIn order to safeguard world peace and security, the Soviet Union put forward a proposal in the Atomic Energy Joint Control Committee of the United Nations organization this spring, advocating that the United States make the secret of atomic energy public, jointly controlled by the United Nations, and destroy existing atomic bombs in order to end international competition for atomic energy and effectively prevent atomic weapons from being used in war. However, the U.S. authorities only agreed to announce the principles of atomic bomb manufacturing, but were unwilling to publish some engineering details of the manufacturing. The American reactionaries openly stated that the atomic bomb has \"such a huge destructive power that it cannot but become a factor in our foreign policy.\" Therefore, the Atomic Energy Commission held several negotiations, but to no avail. In June and July, the Atomic Energy Commission held several meetings in succession, and the Soviet representative Koromyko put forward more specific proposals. The proposal is divided into two parts. The first is to prohibit the use, production and storage of atomic energy weapons under any circumstances, and to destroy all atomic energy weapons that have been manufactured or partially manufactured within three months. The second is to establish two committees under the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Committee to exchange scientific knowledge and information on atomic energy research in various countries, have the right to prevent countries from using atomic energy weapons to harm human beings without authorization, and maintain the veto power of various countries in the Atomic Energy Committee. Under duress, the U.S. representative Baruch also put forward a joint control plan, that is, to establish a committee in the Atomic Energy Control Committee, which not only has full power to control the manufacture and storage of atomic bombs in all countries, but also considers it illegal to use atomic energy for industrial production purposes, and cancels the veto power of various countries in the committee. These two proposals are far apart. According to the U.S. proposal, as long as it is under the supervision of the Atomic Energy Committee, it can continue to be manufactured, and there is no need to destroy the existing ones. Its advocacy of canceling the veto power of various countries in the Atomic Energy Committee is tantamount to saying, \"I want to use it, and you can't control me.\" As a result, the United Nations' decision to guarantee world peace and security after the war has become a dead letter, and the Atomic Energy Control Committee has become a figurehead organization that does not play any role. Therefore, only the implementation of the Soviet proposal can effectively prohibit the use of atomic energy weapons in war, which is in line with the interests of mankind in the world and is also what the American people hope for.\n\nAs far as the Soviet Union itself is concerned, it has strong power, and atomic energy weapons are not terrible. Although the Soviet Union has not yet invented effective weapons to defend against atomic bombs, it has a vast territory in Eurasia, with mountains crisscrossing the country, industry is relatively dispersed, and the population is mainly not concentrated in a few large cities, so the effectiveness of atomic bombs cannot be fully exerted in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet Union has a very strong aviation industry and technology. At present, the most effective method of defending against atomic bomb attacks is to actively send aircraft to find the opponent's aircraft carrying atomic bombs to fight to the death, or to find the base where atomic bombs are stored and completely destroy it. The number of atomic bombs manufactured is limited, so it has no decisive effect on the war at all, which is already unanimously recognized by strategists from various countries. Moreover, the Soviet Union is a country that advocates science and has countless outstanding scientists, as well as rich mineral deposits indispensable for manufacturing atomic bombs. Take uranium (a rare metal in the world) used to split atoms as an example. As far as we know now, the main producing areas of uranium mines in the world are only the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Belgium and Canada. Other countries either have very low output or have none at all. Another favorable condition for the Soviet Union is that it has made new important discoveries in the study of atomic energy. According to the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet scientists have achieved achievements that exceed those of any other country in the study of \"cosmic rays\" in the Caucasus Mountains, and they use \"cosmic rays\" to split atoms, which is much more effective than uranium. Once the research is successful, it will be the most outstanding development in the contribution of atomic energy science. Even American scientists admit that, with the Soviet Union's current scientific level, it will be able to manufacture atomic bombs within two to five years, and they will be better than the existing atomic bombs. The famous French scientist Levy estimates that the Soviet Union will master atomic energy weapons within two years. These scientists' estimates are by no means without basis.\n\nSince the United States is unwilling to make the secret of atomic energy public, of course it has no right to prevent other countries from conducting atomic bomb research and manufacturing for national defense security. The United States is the country with the most concentrated population and economy and industry, and it cannot withstand atomic bomb attacks. Therefore, those American reactionaries who continue to advocate keeping the secret of atomic bombs are increasingly feeling the terror of this threat, advocating dispersing the population and industry of major American cities, but the dispersion of industry will cause serious economic dislocations and economic chaos in the country, which is actually impossible in the United States. Far-sighted people in the United States, such as Wallace, advocate making the secret of atomic bombs public and placing them under the joint control of the United Nations. The scientists who study atomic bombs in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, believe that only by seeking an international control method can the world avoid going down the road of suicide, and condemn those who advocate keeping the secret of atomic bombs for misleading the American people.\n\nIn addition, regarding the issue of atomic energy, the U.S. monopoly capitalists have another \"unspeakable\" distress.\n\nThe United States invented atomic energy, the United States used atomic bombs as diplomatic weapons, and the United States is most afraid of atomic energy. why? Because the invention of atomic energy is a leap in the development of human social productivity. Once applied to production, its productivity will be much greater than steam and electricity, and it will produce more goods for human society. However, to fully utilize the productivity of atomic energy, there is a major premise, that is, the change of social relations of production, which requires the complete collectivization and nationalization of the social economy of various countries. This is \"not what I want\" in capitalist countries, especially in the United States under the dictatorship of financial oligarchs, because that will completely disintegrate the private economic system of the existing capitalist society in the United States. And the only country in the world that has the conditions to use atomic energy for social construction is still the Soviet Union today. The Soviet Union is currently studying atomic energy and has made important achievements. Once the Soviet Union masters atomic energy, it will of course be applied to production first, which is a major super-war threat to the bosses on Wall Street.\n\nThis is the reason why the U.S. representative on the Atomic Energy Commission proposed that \"the use of atomic energy for industrial production purposes is also illegal.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 原子弹外交的苦恼\n杜波\n1946-08-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　原子弹外交的苦恼\n    杜波\n    根据波茨顿三大强国战后合作保证世界和平安全的决定，美国有义务将原子弹秘密公开向世人宣布，以表示其对战后世界和平保证的诚意。但是可惜得很，金元帝国的统治者们，在战争结束以后，却违背了同盟国家在战争中的和谐合作的友谊，不顾红军对反法西斯侵略战争的伟大贡献，乘苏联还没有掌握原子能以前，不仅不愿把原子能置于国际共管之下，反而当做外交上的“法宝”，在国际谈判中作为向苏联讨价还价的工具。\n    去年八月七日，美机在日本濑户内海的广岛，投掷了第一颗原子弹，当时美国几乎动员了全国所有报纸与广播电台，甚至杜鲁门总统也亲自发表声明，扩大宣传原子弹的威力。当时美国一部份反动派，如范登堡之流及赫斯特系报纸，更借此大事吹嘘，把原子弹的发明与实际运用，描写为“世界末日”降临和迫使日本投降的“唯一原因”，故意夸大其威力，而抹煞红军击败关东军为迫使日本迅速投降之决定因素的这一铁的事实，妄图造成原子弹的恐怖，威胁苏联对战后各种问题的让步。\n    正因为如此，一年来，配合着国际间一张一弛的情势，美国曾举行了两次原子弹的试验，一次是在去年联合国大会以后，投掷在美国南部的新墨西哥州，另一次就是上月一日在马群岛中的比基尼珊瑚礁。这次试验举行这巴黎四国外长会议期间，二十一国和会之前不久。\n    特别值得注意的，是这次试验，美国动员了更多的宣传人员去参观。在试验之前一个月就发出消息，大事吹嘘，什么“这次所投掷的原子弹，将发出一千个太阳之热与光”呀，“比基尼将陆沉”呀，耸人听闻，不一而足。但是七月一日试验的结果，不仅未达到预期的效果，相反的却给人们以原子弹“不过如此”的感觉，比基尼并未“陆沉”，即作为原子弹鹄的的七十七艘船舰，也未能摧毁；炸后的军舰上，山羊还在站着嚼草，鱼儿依然悠游在水中。原子弹试验总指挥官勃兰第海军中将也只得承认：“原子弹试验，并不如日军偷袭珍珠港一幕之动人，船舶之损失，远不如预期之大，供实验之猪羊，亦有未死者”。这次试验是出乎美国当局的意料而失败了。\n    参加这次试验的有四万二千人，其中包括海军、科学家、技术人员及新闻记者，耗资在五万万美元以上。试验虽然失败了，美国官方却扬言在不久将再作一次深水试验。可见美国帝国主义者不仅没有放弃原子弹制造的诚意，却正在企求进一步的加以改良。当第一颗原子弹在广岛投下时，杜鲁门总统就曾经声明：“吾人曾与德国进行此史无前例的科学上的赌博，用费达二十万万元，十二万人从事此项工作”。但在德日法西斯业已垮台的今天，美国这种赌博并未停止，所下的“赌注”似乎更加豪爽了，究竟是为的什么呢？诚如英共书记波立特所说，这仍然是美国在外交上的“恫吓政策”。这种“恫吓政策”，是与美国正在逐步推行的“世界基地网计划”、“金元外交”相一致的，是企图实现其独霸世界的野心。不过“世界基地网计划”及“金元外交”，是用以对付全世界的，而原子弹“恫吓政策”的主要对象却是苏联。\n    苏联对于美国这种原子武器的“恫吓政策”，一直保持着冷静与理智的态度。苏联诚恳而坚定的认为战后的世界，各大强国应导向和平安全，而不应导向互相猜疑和战争。因此，在这次美国大规模试验之后，真理报观察家伊萨科夫仅带着惋惜的口吻说：“原子弹试验虽未使世界临于末日，但所破坏之事物，有较一二艘旧舰更为重要者，即吾人之信任心是也”。很显然的，苏联并未因美国这种“恫吓政策”而感觉不安。\n    苏联为了保卫世界的和平与安全，在今年春天，曾在联合国组织机构中的原子能共同管制委员会提出建议，主张美国把原子能秘密公开，由联合国共同管制，并破坏现存的原子弹，以结束国际间原子能的竞争，有效制止原子武器用于战争。但是美国当局仅答应宣布原子弹制造的原理，对制造上的若干工程细则却不愿公布，美国反动派并公开声言，原子弹具有“如此巨大的毁灭性，不能不成为我们外交政策中的一个因素”，因此原子能委员会几经谈判，终无结果。六七月间，原子能委员会又曾连续举行了几次会谈，苏联代表柯罗米科提出了更具体的建议，这个建议共分两部份，一是在任何情况下，禁止使用、生产及保存原子能武器，在三个月内将一切已经制成或制成一部份的原子能武器全部予以破坏；二是在联合国原子能管制委员会之下设立两个委员会，以交换有关各国原子能研究的科学知识和情报，有权防止各国擅自利用原子能武器伤害人类，并保持原子能委员会中各国的否决权。美国代表巴鲁区在被迫的情况下，也提出了一个共同管制的方案，就是在原子能管制委员会中设立一个委员会，不仅有全权管制一切国家之原子弹的制造与保藏，而且认为利用原子能为工业生产上的用途亦为违法，并在该委员会中，取消各国的否决权。这两个提案是相距很远的，根据美国的提案，只要在原子能委员会监督之下，还是可以继续制造，现存的也不必破坏，而其所主张取消原子能委员会中各国的否决权，又无异是“我要使用，你管不着我”的说法，结果还是使联合国保证战后世界和平安全的决定，成为一纸空文，原子能管制委员会成为不起任何作用的空头机关。因此，只有实行苏联的提案，才能有效的禁止原子能武器用于战争，才是合乎世界人类利益的，也是美国人民所希望的。\n    对于苏联本身来讲，它具有强大力量，原子能武器并不是可怕的东西。苏联虽然还没发明有效防御原子弹的武器，但它却有广袤欧亚大陆的领土，国内山脉纵横，工业比较分散，人口主要不是集中在几个大城市里，原子弹的效能在苏联并不能充分发挥。同时，苏联有很强大的航空工业和技术，目前最有效的防御原子弹袭击的方法，便是主动派遣飞机寻找对方载有原子弹的飞机作战而同归于尽，或者寻找保藏原子弹的基地予以彻底摧毁。原子弹制造的数量是有限的，因此对战争完全没有什么决定作用，这已经是各国战略家所一致公认的。况且，苏联是一个科学倡明的国家，拥有无数优秀的科学家，也有丰富的制造原子弹不可缺少的矿藏。就拿用以分裂原子的铀（世界上稀有的金属）来说，就目前所知，世界铀矿的主要产地仅有苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、比利时和加拿大，其他各国不是产量很少，就是完全没有。苏联的另外一个有利条件，是它在研究原子能上，已经有了新的重要的发现。据苏联科学院宣布，苏联科学家在高加索山中研究“宇宙线”，已经获得超过任何国家的成就，并且用“宇宙线”来分裂原子，比铀的效能大得多，一旦研究成功，在原子能科学的贡献上，将是最卓越的发展。即使美国的科学家们也承认，以苏联今天的科学水平，在二年到五年的期间，必能制造原子弹，且将较现有的原子弹更为优良。而法国的著名科学家李维估计，苏联在两年之内，便将掌握原子能武器。这些科学家的估计决不是没有根据的。\n    美国既然不愿将原子能秘密公开，当然它没有权力阻止别的国家为了国防安全而进行原子弹的研究与制造。美国是一个人口和经济工业最集中的国家，最经受不起原子弹的袭击。因此，目前那些继续主张保守原子弹秘密的美国反动派们，正日益感受这种威胁的可怕，主张将美国各大城市的人口与工业分散，但工业分散，又将引起国内严重的经济脱节与经济紊乱，事实上在美国是办不到的。美国有远见的人士如华莱士等，便主张把原子弹秘密公开，置于联合国共同管制之下。在美国田纳西州象岭研究原子弹的科学家们，更认为只有寻求一个国际管制的方法，才能避免世界走上自杀的道路，并谴责那些主张保持原子弹秘密的人，是把美国人民导入歧途。\n    此外，关于原子能的问题，美国独占资本的大亨们还有一个“难言之隐”的苦恼。\n    发明原子能的是美国，利用原子弹为外交武器的是美国，对原子能最为恐惧的也是美国。为什么？因为原子能的发明，是人类社会生产力的一个飞跃的发展，一旦应用到生产上去，它的生产力将较蒸气和电力大得多，将给人类社会生产更多的物品。但是，要充分利用原子能的生产力，有一个重大的前提，那便是社会生产关系的变革，要求各国社会经济完全集体化和国家化，而这在资本主义国家，尤其是金融寡头专政的美国，是“非吾所愿”的，因为那将使美国现存的资本主义社会的私有经济制度完全解体。而世界唯一具备以原子能用于社会建设事业之条件的国家，在今天还只有苏联。苏联目前正在研究原子能，并且获得了重要的成就，苏联一旦掌握了原子能，当然会首先应用到生产上去，这对于华尔街的老板们是一个重大的超战争的威胁。\n    在原子能委员会上，美国代表之所以提出“利用原子能为工业生产上的用途亦为违法”，原因就在这里。"

    "content": "[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] A spokesman for the Yan'an Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the bombing of Yan'an Headquarters by eight Kuomintang planes (Note by the reporter: the previous report of seven planes was an error, it was eight planes): While representatives of the Kuomintang, the United States, and the Chinese Communist Party are still negotiating for peace, the Kuomintang suddenly dispatched B-24 bombers on the 2nd of this month to bomb our headquarters, and used machine guns to fire approximately 10,000 bullets in the vicinity of our headquarters. The Kuomintang Air Force has bombed and strafed liberated areas countless times in the past six months, causing many deaths and injuries to our peaceful residents and significant losses. Now, they have even bombed and strafed Yan'an, which is an extremely serious and intolerable incident. Our headquarters has now telegraphed the CCP representatives in Nanjing and Beiping to lodge a serious protest, demanding not only an apology and compensation from the Kuomintang side, but also a complete ban on the use of any air force in the civil war. We believe that if the Kuomintang authorities have even a little bit of sincerity for peace and a sense of humanity, they cannot reject our just demands. The US government, standing on the position of mediating the Chinese civil war, should of course support this minimal method of reducing the cruelty of the civil war. Moreover, it should be solemnly pointed out that the planes, bombs, machine guns, machine gun bullets, and gasoline used by the Kuomintang in this bombing and strafing of Yan'an and previous bombings and strafings of various liberated areas were all manufactured and supplied by the United States and the US government. The personnel of the Kuomintang Air Force were also trained by American officers in China and in the United States. The US government, merely to demonstrate the necessary impartial attitude of continuing to participate in mediating the Chinese civil war, merely to express that it does not participate in or support the bombing and strafing of Yan'an and other liberated areas, cannot escape the political and moral responsibility of stopping the Kuomintang from using American air force weapons to massacre the Chinese people.\n\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th] Tokyo Dispatch: Yesterday, all Tokyo newspapers published the Xinhua News Agency's broadcast of the news of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang planes bombing Yan'an in prominent positions. \"Minpo,\" the organ of the Japan Socialist Party (edited by Hitoshi Yamakawa), featured the news of the bombing of Yan'an as the lead story, with the headline \"The Most Important Stage of the Kuomintang-Communist War.\" \"Miyako Shimbun,\" which has a wide circulation, also published the news in a similarly prominent position. Minpo also published an editorial stating: The current situation in China may even provoke international joint intervention. The newspaper suggested: First, Chiang Kai-shek must abandon the idea of eliminating the Chinese Communist army within two or three months; second, the Chinese people's anti-civil war movement must be strengthened; and third, foreign public opinion must listen to the opinions of the Chinese people.\n\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] Reuters, New York, 4th: New York Broadcasting announced tonight that Marshall, after receiving the CCP's protest against the bombing of the CCP capital Yan'an, had further discussions with Chiang Kai-shek.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 5th: The Paris Peace Conference has concluded its first week of work. During this week, representatives from 21 nations have delivered speeches at the general assembly, generally outlining their respective countries' policies toward the Paris Peace Conference. The plenary session must be temporarily adjourned pending the completion of work by the Rules of Procedure Committee, which will then submit a report on the rules of procedure to the assembly. The meetings of the Rules of Procedure Committee play a crucial role at the beginning of the conference. In their general resolutions, the Council of Foreign Ministers presented six recommendations regarding the rules of procedure to the conference. The discussions of the Rules of Procedure Committee last week were based on these recommendations. Five points have been passed, three of which are relatively important: firstly, the procedure for establishing a motion. The decision was: \"Regarding any issue related to the draft treaty, the General Assembly may include it in the agenda upon the request of any delegation.\" Secondly, the organizational law of the political and economic committees for reviewing the draft treaties. The decision was: \"Representatives from the 21 nations can participate in the review committee of the five-nation treaties. However, countries that did not declare war on the respective countries will not have the right to vote.\" Thirdly, the chairman of the General Assembly. The decision was: \"The four powers will take turns chairing.\" An important point in the rules of procedure that has not yet been decided is the number of votes required to pass a motion. This is the most debated issue in the Rules of Procedure Committee. The crux of this issue lies in the opposition of the Australian and Dutch representatives to the Foreign Ministers' decision to pass a motion with a two-thirds vote, and their insistence on a simple majority. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes made a special statement the day before the meeting: the U.S. position at the conference would be to support the results negotiated by the Council of Foreign Ministers. However, in the specific discussion, Byrnes abstained from voting on the aforementioned second issue (i.e., the organizational law of the political and economic committees for reviewing the draft treaties). This is why he did not take a consistent step with the four powers on this issue. TASS Paris reported: \"Although some members of the Council of Foreign Ministers have a two-faced attitude at the conference, the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers cannot be shaken.\" Moscow Radio commentator Heffman also pointed out at the same time: \"The consistency of the four powers is extremely important for the success or failure of the conference.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 5th: The Paris Peace Conference adjourned yesterday. Observers of the conference expect that the committees of the assembly will discuss the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland one by one. The only remaining issue in the Rules of Procedure Committee, namely the number of votes required to pass a motion, may be decided in one or two days. Bidault will issue formal invitations in the name of the 21 nations to the five smaller countries, inviting them to send representatives to Paris to state their opinions on the draft treaties. The conference has not yet determined the requests of Albania, Egypt, Luxembourg, Mexico, and Cuba that \"they have the right to attend the conference.\" In addition, British Prime Minister Attlee returned to London during the adjournment. The British government announced on the evening of the 4th: After Attlee's meeting with Bevin, it was decided that the British delegation to the conference would be led by First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander. It is reported that Bevin may go to Paris in a few days to lead the British delegation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴黎和会暂时休会  大会表决票数问题悬而未决\n\n1946-08-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴黎和会暂时休会\n    大会表决票数问题悬而未决\n    【新华社延安五日电】巴黎和会已结束其第一周的工作。在第一周中，二十一国代表已在大会先后发表演说，一般的阐述各该国对巴黎和会的政策。全体大会须暂时休会，以待程序规则委员会完成其工作，届时程委会将向大会提出程序规则报告。程委会的集会，在和会初开时，起最重要的作用。巴黎外长会议在其一般的决议中，曾对和会提出六点关于程序规则的建议。上周程委会所讨论者，即根据此种建议。目前已通过五点，其中三点比较重要：其一为议案的成立手续。其决定为：“关于和约草案之任何问题，倘经任何代表团之申请时，大会得将其列入会议程序”。其二为审查和约草案之政治经济委员会的组织法。其决定为：“二十一国的代表均可以参加五国和约的审查委员会。但除对各该国宣战的国家外，其余国家无表决权”。其三为大会的主席。其决定为：“由四强轮流担任”。程序规则中重要的一点尚未作出决定，即关于通过议案时所需要的票数。这是程委会中争论最烈的问题。这一问题的症结，在于澳荷代表反对外长会议三分之二票通过议案的决定，并坚持过半数即可。美国务卿贝纳斯在开会的前一天，曾特别声明：美国在和会中的立场，将为支持外长会议所协商的结果。但在具体讨论时，贝纳斯曾在上述第二个问题（即审查和约草案之政治经济委员会的组织法）进行表决中弃权。这就是他在这个问题上没有采取四强一致的步骤。塔斯社巴黎电讯曾称：“虽然外长委员会的某些委员在和会上带着两面派的态度，但外长委员会的决定是不能动摇的。”莫斯科广播评论员赫夫曼亦同时指出：“四强之一致性，对于和会之成功与否极为重要。”\n    【新华社延安五日电】巴黎和会昨日休会。和会观察家预料大会各委员会将逐一研讨对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案。程委会中留下的唯一问题，即通过议案时所需之票数问题，可能有一二日内即行决定。比道尔将以二十一国名义向前五小国发出正式请柬，请其派代表赴巴黎申述他们对和约草案的意见。对阿尔巴尼亚、埃及、卢森堡、墨西哥与古巴之“他们有权出席和会”的要求，和会尚未确定。此外英首相艾德礼于休会时返回伦敦，英政府于四日晚宣布：艾德礼在与贝文会谈之后，决定英国出席和会的代表团，由海相亚历山大率领。据悉，贝文或将于数日内赴巴黎领导英国代表团。"

    "content": "Cadres Frankly Confess Mistakes and Make Self-Criticisms\n    Congzhong Town Mass Movement Restarted\n    [This Newspaper, Handan News] Recently, Congzhong Town in this county resolved the issue of unity between cadres and the masses, and restarted the mass movement. The village had undergone struggle sessions this spring, but they were extremely incomplete. Illegal landlords and usurers were only fined, and that was the end of it. Many problems were not resolved, and the fines were reduced privately by the cadres. The distribution of the remaining portion was also extremely inappropriate. Apart from a small amount given to the \"victims,\" the majority was taken by the cadres, and the masses received very little. In addition, the cadres also received land from the landlords as \"support,\" which led to their gradual degeneration and disregard for the masses. All of this caused dissatisfaction among the masses towards the cadres, leading to the stagnation of the movement. After the Reversal Team × Group from the Military and Political University arrived in the village, they quickly understood the situation. They allowed the masses to offer suggestions to the cadres, and worked with the cadres to settle the accounts of the struggle sessions, enlightening the cadres to frankly reflect on their mistakes to the masses. After three days of fermentation and three days of mass meetings, the grievances in the masses' hearts were all vented, and the cadres also frankly confessed their mistakes and made self-criticisms to the masses. At this time, the leadership also explained to the masses the past contributions of the cadres. The masses also unanimously recognized that the cadres were all poor people and were on their side. As long as they corrected their mistakes, they should be forgiven. Therefore, the excess fruits that the cadres had taken and the land they had received as \"support\" from the landlords were forgiven by the masses, and they were not asked to return them. The cadres also expressed that they would resolutely correct their mistakes in the future. Following this, the peasant association was rectified, and peasant association members were re-elected. The new members publicly swore that they would resolutely lead the masses to thoroughly stand up, not be greedy, not be corrupt, not be bought or exploited by the landlords, unite with each other, etc., and led all the peasant association members to swear: \"Cadres and the masses must unite together!\" After this resolution, the masses' enthusiasm for struggle was greatly enhanced, and a new struggle is brewing.

    "content": "(Changzhi News) The Chengguan District of Wuan is actively preparing to comprehensively and deeply launch the anti-traitor revenge and rent reduction liquidation struggle. On July 28th and 29th, the district leaders went deep into the area to conduct inspections. Although the 24 streets of Chengguan have undergone many vigorous joint struggles, the development of the movement is still very unbalanced and incomplete. The following serious problems still exist: First, in the streets with poor or newly initiated movements, all kinds of complex and unclear bad elements take the opportunity to infiltrate the leading groups of each street. Among the government cadres of the Eighth Street, the deputy street chief, the anti-conscription committee member, and the secretary are all landlords owning more than 80 to 150 mu of land. The father of the chairman of the People's Federation served as a secretary for the great traitor Li Maozhai. The landlord secretly retorted to him: \"You, the leader, are fighting me, who will fight your father?\" Therefore, he never dared to raise his head. The street held meetings with guards, blocking the work personnel. Anyone who leaked information would face confession, punishment, and beatings. The Sixteenth Street, which was pseudo-ized and poisoned in the past, was the old nest of great traitors and drug dealers such as Han Leran, Bai Huan, Dong Laowu, and Qi Zhanmei. The cadres of this street shielded landlords by pretending to be enlightened and engaging in false struggles. Other streets, such as the Fifteenth, Eleventh, Fourth, and Fifth Streets, also belong to this type. The masses do not believe that they can lead the turning over, saying that they are \"welcoming to anyone.\" Secondly, in the better mobilized streets, such as the Thirteenth and First Streets, although a group of reliable cadres and activists have emerged, and some mass organizations have been improved, and the masses have gained considerable benefits, they are also very incomplete. For example, in the First Street, out of 150 households, 18 households have obtained fruits, and 15 households have not turned over. The landlords in the 24 streets generally still control a large number of houses and retain a large amount of land, and have not yet been liquidated. After such an inspection, it was decided that the mass movement in Chengguan still needs to be further deepened and comprehensively and vigorously launched. The leadership concentrated its efforts and focused on backward streets to help backward people. First, break through the blockade circle of bad cadres, resolutely eliminate special agents and landlords from the leading groups, and mobilize a wider range of the masses from the continued telling of grievances to discover problems. By solving individual problems, we will then organize large-scale joint struggles to completely defeat feudal rule. Transform hooligans, smokers, prostitutes, and lower-level personnel and families of puppet troops and puppet organizations, and carry out the \"hat removal movement,\" proposing: \"The poor are one family, and they should be treated the same after removing their hats,\" so that 80% of the masses can obtain fruits and achieve the elimination of extreme poverty.\n\nOn the 30th and 31st, a meeting of active cadres and activists in the entire Chengguan turning-over process was held to conduct specific inspections and discussions. It was unanimously agreed that in order to thoroughly turn over, it is necessary to achieve \"having the capital to do business, and daring to make decisions when speaking as masters.\" Now, all streets have launched mass turning-over inspections, and turning-over committees have been established in the four cardinal points of east, west, north, and south. People with real turning-over experience and supported by the masses are elected as members to uniformly mobilize forces and solve disputes between streets. Turning-over assault groups will also be formed to help backward streets launch a vigorous turning-over movement.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Chongqing Dispatch: Mr. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, authored an article in Chengdu on July 21st, clarifying the League's position and condemning the Kuomintang authorities' destructive activities against the League. Mr. Zhang stated first: \"From the beginning, the Democratic League has advocated that China needs democracy, needs peaceful unification, and does not want the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to engage in civil war. Advocating democracy naturally requires the Kuomintang to abandon one-party dictatorship and personal autocracy. Because advocating peaceful unification naturally requires both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to cease military conflict and resolve disputed issues through political consultation. Coincidentally, the Communist Party's demands are the same as the Democratic League's, also opposing one-party dictatorship, demanding that all parties establish a coalition government, and demanding a long-term truce to resolve military and political issues through consultation, which is inherently extremely correct. The Kuomintang people do not realize their mistakes, but instead hate the Democratic League as the Communist Party's tail. The Kuomintang authorities, insisting that one-party dictatorship is a right they cannot lose, and the pro-war faction, insisting on obtaining American aid to attempt to eliminate the Communist Party by force in the short term, therefore oppose democracy, oppose peace, oppose the Communist Party, and always want to undermine the Democratic League and strike at the Democratic League.\"\n\nMr. Zhang continued: \"Since last September, the Democratic League has been subjected to either enticement for division or threats for suppression. For example, a certain government official told Mr. Huang Renzi that the government was helping a certain party with tens of millions of yuan in funding, allowing it to expand its membership, in order to encourage Mr. Huang Renzi, but Huang was unmoved. Also, a certain government official advised Mr. Zhang Junli, saying: The government will fully assist and specialize in helping a certain party group; Mr. Junli was also unmoved. These are examples of using enticement to try to divide the Democratic League. Furthermore, during the Political Consultative Conference, military police and secret agents in the capital suddenly went to search Mr. Renzi's bedroom, and at the celebration of the Political Consultative Conference at Jiaochangkou, secret agents and hooligans went to beat Mr. Li Gongpu and others. At the end of last month, Mr. Zhang Zhi＠'s residence here was placed under surveillance by secret agents, who claimed that once the punitive order was issued, the heterodox parties would be completely cleared away, giving the Democratic League a major blow. Especially in the current two months, secret agents have successively murdered comrades Wang Ren and Li Furen (Note: Mr. Li has been rescued and escaped danger) in Xi'an. This month, Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo in Kunming were also successively assassinated by secret agents. These are all examples of using threats to suppress the Democratic League.\"\n\nFinally, Mr. Zhang solemnly stated: \"Standing in the position of the Democratic League, we are still firmly neutral towards the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; standing in the position of the state, we must clearly distinguish right from wrong in the actions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. No matter how they entice or threaten, in order to realize the aspirations of the Republic of China for democracy, unity, peaceful unification, we only adhere to eight characters: \"persevere and be indomitable!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民盟主席张澜氏著文  谴责蒋方破坏民盟  重申该盟和平民主一贯愿望\n\n1946-08-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民盟主席张澜氏著文\n    谴责蒋方破坏民盟\n    重申该盟和平民主一贯愿望\n    【新华社延安五日电】渝讯：中国民主同盟主席张澜氏七月二十一日在蓉著文阐明民盟立场，并谴责国民党当局对民盟的破坏活动。张氏首称：“民盟自始即主张中国需要民主，需要和平统一，不愿国共两党发生内战。主张民主，当然要求国民党放弃一党专政和个人独裁。因为主张和平统一，当然要求国民党、共产党双方停止军事冲突，以政治协商来解决所争执的问题。恰恰共产党的要求与民盟主张一样，也反对一党专政，要求各党派成立联合政府，并要求长期停战，用协商来解决军事政治各问题，这本是极正确的。国民党人不自觉悟其非，反恨民盟是共产党尾巴。国民党当权派既坚持一党专政为他们不可损失的权利，主战派坚持获得美国援助，企图在短期内以武力消灭共产党，于是反民主反和平反共产党，并总想破坏民盟，打击民盟。”张氏继称：“从去年九月以来，对于民盟不是用利诱来分化，便是用威胁来打击。例如政府某要人告黄任之先生称：政府帮助某党经费数千万元，任它扩大其党员，以之鼓励黄任之先生，而黄不为所动。又政府某某要人劝张君励先生谓：政府一切协助，专以帮助某党团；君励先生亦不为之动。这是用利诱以图分化民盟的事证。又如在政协会议期中，陪都军警特务突去搜查任之先生的卧室，较场口庆祝政协会上，特务流氓又去打李公朴先生等。前月底，此间张志＠先生住宅之被特务监视，并称一俟讨伐令下，即荡然清除异党，予民盟以重大打击。尤其是目前两月，特务已在西安前后杀害了本盟同志王任、李敷仁（按：李氏已获救脱险）。本月昆明李公朴、闻一多两先生亦相继被特务暗杀，这都是用威胁打击民盟的事证。”最后张氏严正表示：“我们站在民盟立场，对于国共两党仍然是确定中立；站在国家立场，对于国共两党的行动，即必须明辩是非。任他如何利诱，如何威胁，我们为了中华民国的民主团结和平统一之志能实现，只坚守八个字：“再接再厉，不屈不挠”！"

Before the war, annual production exceeded one million piculs, valued at seven million yuan. However, they never received assistance from the Kuomintang government. During the war, they suffered planned destruction by the Japanese invaders. The four major fishing areas of Anxi, Lianjiang, Dongshan, and Pingtan are currently in the fishing season, but the 210,000 fishermen directly engaged in fishing and the 800,000 people involved in fish curing and equipment are living extremely difficult lives under the \"official harassment\" of pirates, puppet troops, and the Kuomintang's harsh government.\n\n　　The pirates and puppet troops turned into pirates, scattered soldiers, and vagrants are a major disaster for the fishermen. From November of last year to March of this year, fishermen hardly went a day without encountering pirates. There was even a week when 23 robbery cases occurred. Kunshan in Zhenpu Road and Dongyong in Lianjiang County are havens for bandits.\n\n　　The Kuomintang's military police treat fishermen as ignorant people, demanding \"dry goods\" and \"grease money\" from them in the name of inspection. There was a time when the journey of less than 100 li from the mouth of the Min River to the Taijiang district required passing through 18 \"inspections.\"\n\n　　Another form of \"official harassment\" is tax on tax (or fee), which has become a disguised form of customs duty. In late June, fishing boats passing through Qianjiang were detained because of a handling fee, which involved fish worth ten million yuan. The handling fee is a blessing bestowed on the fishermen by the Kuomintang's loyal organ—the Senate. It is said to be used as a \"national education fund.\"\n\n　　There is a \"fish broker\" between the fishermen and the market. Fujian's \"fish brokers\" come in two types: market \"fish brokers\" and island \"fish brokers.\" Market \"fish brokers\" are fishing brokers, while island \"fish brokers\" are even more unreasonable exploiters, relying on a scale to extract an additional 10%. Now, they are using the beautiful name of cooperatives to carry out this exploitation, and fishermen cannot escape this circle of exploitation whether they enter the market or trade in the district.\n\n　　Under these layers of extraction, fishermen have no way to develop. In the past, they had 10,800 fishing boats, but now they only have 6,000, and all of them are small. As for the larger \"diao boats,\" they have now disappeared.\n　　　　　　　　　　(Yan'an Xinhua News Agency)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 福建的渔民\n\n1946-08-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　福建的渔民\n    长约一千八百余里的福建沿海为我国重要渔场之一，依之为生者不下百万人。战前每年生产在一百万市担以上，获值七百万元，但从来没有得到国民党政府的帮助。战时又遭受日寇有计划的破坏。安×、连江、东山、平潭四大渔区正是渔汛期，但直接捕鱼的二十一万渔民和从事腌制渔具的八十万人，却在海盗、伪军、国民党苛政的“官扰”之下，度着极艰难的日子。\n    原来的海盗、伪军变成的海盗、散兵、游勇是渔民的大灾星。自去年十一月至今年三月，渔民几乎没有一天不遇到海盗的光顾，曾经有一个星期发生了二十三件劫案。阵浦路的昆山与连江县的东勇，更是匪盗之汇。\n    国民党的军警把渔民看作愚民，以检查之名向渔民要“干子”“油水”。曾有一个时期，自闽江口至台江区，这未及百里的归程竟要经过十八次“检查”。\n    另一种“官扰”是税上加税（或费），成为变相的关卡厘金。六月下旬，渔船路过前江，曾发生因手续费而要扣押价值千万元的渔货的事。手续费乃是国民党御用机关——参议会所通过的对渔民的恩赐。据说作为“国教基金”。\n    渔民与市场之间有一种“鱼牙”。福建的“鱼牙”，有市场“鱼牙”与岛屿“鱼牙”两种。市场“鱼牙”是渔的掮客，而岛屿“鱼牙”则是更无理的剥削者，他们凭一根秤加一成的抽用。现在更用了合作社的美名干这压榨的勾当，渔民进市场或在区成交都逃不出这一剥削圈子。\n    在这层层的榨取下，渔民没有办法发展，过去他们有一万八百艘渔船，现在只剩了六千艘，而且都是小型的。至于较大型的“吊船”现在绝迹了。\n                          （延安新华社）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: United Press, London, July 22nd: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 27th a lengthy article from \"New Times\" magazine reviewing American policy toward China, stating: The United States is fostering civil war in China in order to ensure its economic and political dominance in the Far East. The Soviet Republic cannot remain indifferent to such a policy of the United States in China. The United States regards its economic advantages in China as legitimate compensation for its war effort and views China as its new economic frontier. The main factor causing the Chinese civil war is the United States' assistance to reactionary figures within the Kuomintang in fighting the democratic movement. This is even more evident when observing the situation in China. The current American policy in China is drastically different from that adopted by the Roosevelt administration, which during the war, strived to promote Chinese unity. Now, the efforts of the United States are aimed at strengthening Chiang Kai-shek's power to counter the Communist forces. As a result, thousands of American soldiers are being forced to engage in an undeclared war for a reactionary and oppressive regime. Judging by the actions of the American military in China, it appears that the army is engaged in large-scale operations. The U.S. Seventh Fleet has concentrated in Qingdao, where military clashes are expected to occur. The commander of the U.S. Marines in Qingdao has even announced his intention to assist the Chinese government forces. A squadron of American warships in South China travels back and forth along the Yangtze River, using the pretext of maintaining order to assist the Chinese government in reinforcement efforts. This leads one to conclude that the United States has no intention of changing its policy of interfering in China's internal affairs. The ultimate goal of this policy is to promote American ambitions to not only establish economic and political bases in China but also to create strategic bases so that the United States can dominate the Far East. There is no doubt about this. The unanimous opinion of the Soviet Republic is that it is time to earnestly implement the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference on China. These decisions established the minimum prerequisites for a satisfactory resolution of China's internal problems and the safeguarding of lasting peace in the Far East. Editor's note: This broadcast from Moscow Radio has attracted great attention in Chinese public opinion circles. On July 29th, the Dagongbao published an editorial entitled \"The Harm of International Interference,\" which stated: \"If the Chinese civil war does not stop, then another foreign ministers conference or similar international conference to discuss the China question and prevent American interference in China is not impossible.\" The editorial called for \"quickly laying down the guns of civil war.\" Unexpectedly, this editorial in the Dagongbao incurred the displeasure of the Kuomintang authorities. Under the personal guidance of Chiang Kai-shek, the Guling Lixing Daily, in its third-day editorial, vehemently attacked the Dagongbao as \"fugitives from justice\" who needed to be \"cleansed\" and expressed its rejection of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference's decision on China's realization of peace and democracy, while also welcoming the presence of American troops in China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国继续干涉中国内政  苏联表示不能漠视  中国问题应依莫斯科三国外长会议决定解决\n\n1946-08-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国继续干涉中国内政\n    苏联表示不能漠视\n    中国问题应依莫斯科三国外长会议决定解决\n    【新华社延安五日电】联合社伦敦七月二十二日电：莫斯科电台廿七日广播“新时代”杂志检讨美国对华政策之长文称：美国正在培植中国之内战，俾确保其远东之经济及政治支配权。苏维埃共和国对于美国此种在华政策，殊不能漠然视之。美国已视在华经济优势为其作战之合法报酬，更视中国为其新的经济边陲。引起中国内战之主要因素，乃为美国协助国民党中反动人物与民主运动交战，此点就中国之事态观之，更为明显。美国现行在华政策，实与罗斯福政府所采行者迥然不同，盖在战时曾努力促成中国团结，现在美国之努力乃在加强蒋介石实力对抗中共军。其结果，美军盈千被迫为反动压迫政权从事不宣而战之战争。就在华美军之行动判断，若军正在大举行动，美国第七舰队已集中青岛，该区将发生军事冲突，青岛美陆战队司令且已宣布其协助中国政府军之意向。华南美舰一队往返长江，借口维持治安，协助中国政府增援事宜，令人不得不推断美国无意改变其干涉中国内政之政策。而此种政策之远大目的，乃为促进美国野心，在华不但建立经济与政治根据地，更拟造成战略根据地，以便美国得以支配远东，实无疑问。苏维埃共和国之一致意见，认为切实实现莫斯科外长会议对华各项决议，此其时也。盖是项决议曾有圆满解决中国国内问题及保障远东持久和平之最低限度先决条件。编者按：莫斯科电台这一广播，引起了中国舆论界的极大注意。七月二十九日，大公报曾为此发表社论，题为“国际干涉之害”，内称：“若中国内战不停，则再来外长会议或类似的国际会议讨论中国问题，阻止美国干涉中国问题也不是不可能的”。该社论呼吁“快放下内战的枪”。不料大公报这篇社论竟遭了国民党当局之忌，在蒋介石亲自指导之下，牯岭力行日报于其三日社论中，大骂大公报为“畏罪之徒”，有“冲洗”之必要，并表示不承认莫斯科三外长会议关于中国实现和平民主的决定，和表示欢迎美军驻华。"

    "date": "1946-08-08",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Comrade Chen Visits the Wise\n    ——How were the masses of Hulaozhuang, Huai'an mobilized?\n    Hulaozhuang was a \"blank village\"\n    Hulaozhuang is a small village in Yuezhuang Village, Eqian Township, Shitou District, Huai'an. All fourteen families in the village were tenant farmers who suffered cruel exploitation by feudal forces year-round, living worse than animals. When the work team first organized the masses in Eqian Township to fight against traitors, Hulaozhuang also organized a farmers' association and a women's association, but all the participants from each family were children, old men, and old women. Not a single young person participated, and the two female leaders in their forties and fifties did not manage things. When the work team summarized its work, it found that although this village had the framework of mass organizations, it was a \"blank village.\" The second time the work team went to Eqian Township, all the villages in the township were very active, but Hulaozhuang remained like a stagnant pond, and the village and township cadres felt helpless.\n    Comrade Chen's first \"visit to the wise\"\n    Later, Hulaozhuang was assigned to Dongzhuang Village. Comrade Chen of Dongzhuang Village carefully studied the situation in Hulaozhuang and found that the reason for not mobilizing the masses was mainly \"no one taking the lead.\" Therefore, he decided to first find activists to enlighten and organize the masses.\n    Hu Lianhai was a young man who had suffered in the past, so Comrade Chen decided to target him. One day, Comrade Chen met Hu Lianhai, talked to him about his past suffering, and mobilized him to work for the people. When he heard this, he blushed and was about to leave, saying, \"I don't have time to do it.\" Comrade Chen asked him who in the village could work for the people because he was eager to get away. He said, \"We are uneducated people and cannot handle things. You can talk to Third Master in the west and Erquan in my family.\" Then he left.\n    The search for Hu Lianhai failed in this way. Comrade Chen reviewed the reasons for the failure and concluded that he was too impatient, mobilizing him to work for the people at the first meeting, which made things awkward.\n    Comrade Chen's second \"visit to the wise\"\n    What kind of person was Third Master? After inquiring from all sides, he learned that he was an old man named Hu Biyou, over sixty years old, skilled in farming, and had prestige in the village. The farmers in the village all trusted him, so Comrade Chen decided to find him.\n    The first time Comrade Chen went to Hu Biyou's house for a casual chat, Hu Biyou was very restrained. Comrade Chen thought that if he immediately talked about the exploitation of landlords, he would definitely not be willing to talk about it, so he started with \"Er Huang.\" Comrade Chen said, \"In the past, how did the 'Er Huang' treat the people here?\" Hu Biyou replied, \"Alas! We suffered a lot!\" The conversation started in this way, from \"Er Huang\" to the old Central Government, from the old Central Government to the New Fourth Army, gradually shaking Hu Biyou's \"changing the world\" ideology. But Hu Biyou was still just evasively responding without expressing his attitude, so Comrade Chen bid farewell and left. Before leaving, he encouraged him, saying, \"You are the senior elder in this village. Whether the village is doing well or not depends on you, old man, taking the lead!\"\n    Enlightening the masses from all aspects\n    The day after the conversation, Comrade Chen went to Hulaozhuang again to convene a village meeting, but did not raise the issue of calculating rent accounts. Instead, he generally unblocked ideas and talked about many examples of other villages actively calculating rent accounts. After this, activists in Huzhuang, such as Shen Yuzhen, also came over to discuss with the tenant farmers during their free time in the morning and evening. Shen Yuzhen asked, \"Isn't this strange? You farm Liu Hetai's land, and I also farm Liu Hetai's land. You don't pay pre-borrowed wheat, soy sauce wheat, or puppet fees, but we suffer. Does he treat you especially well?\" The people of Hulaozhuang were all silent and didn't speak, but they gradually became active inside. Two or three days later, he met Hu Biyou again. Hu Biyou was much more polite than last time, inviting Comrade Chen to sit in a house. He talked freely about the suffering under \"Er Huang,\" saying, \"When repairing the ghost dike, our village provided more labor than others, and the puppet fees were also more than others. We poor people provided money and labor, and they still scolded us as stubborn fools!\" Seeing that the conversation was gradually becoming congenial, Comrade Chen explained to him the government's rules (referring to policies and laws) and the fact that the democratic government worked for the people, and further inspired him to come out and take the lead, saying, \"In the past, you suffered from others. Now you have something to say and a reason to speak. You won't be bullied anymore.\" After talking for a long time, Comrade Chen remembered that he believed in Township Head Zhao Biwen and Zhao Zeng, and said to Hu, \"Third Master! You have to take the lead in calculating the rent accounts in your village!\" He first used Township Head Zhao's words as a lead to talk to him, linking it to the rent accounts of Hulaozhuang. However, he did not immediately mobilize them to take action. Instead, he changed the subject and cited many examples of calculating rent accounts, such as the land of Shen Yuzhen's family in Houhuzhuang, which had been forcibly taken away by the village head, but now it has been calculated back! He talked while watching his reaction.\n    Breaking concerns, Hu Biyou dares to come forward\n    At this time, Hu Biyou did not mention that there was no account to calculate, and his heart was gradually moving. But at the same time, new doubts arose. Liu Hetai has fields in Qiudong Township and Bodian Township. It's not worth leading the trouble in one village. If he can mobilize three townships, this village can also be counted. On the one hand, he thought that Liu Hetai's village head, Yu Bingrong, was good at speaking and writing, and he couldn't outtalk him. Seeing this, Comrade Chen immediately told him in response to these two points: (1) Whichever township can calculate first and take advantage of it, calculate it first. If you are afraid of offending people, he is also afraid of offending people. Who will come forward first? (2) Only with reason can you win people over. Relying solely on being able to speak is useless.\n    Considering that their concerns could not be eliminated for a while, Comrade Chen bid farewell and left again. After this conversation, Hu Biyou was invited to participate in several village and township meetings related to calculating rent accounts. At these meetings, Hu Biyou saw many practical examples and gained a lot of knowledge, which greatly changed his thinking, abandoning his concerns about \"not worth it\" and \"offending people.\" In particular, other villages had already calculated their accounts in a lively manner, and no one was willing to lag behind, which greatly changed his \"changing the world\" ideology.\n    The third time, Comrade Chen found Hu Biyou again and directly raised the issue of calculating rent accounts in Hulaozhuang. Comrade Chen said, \"Whether the accounts in this village are calculated well or not depends entirely on you, old man, taking the lead!\" At this time, Hu Biyou's thinking on calculating accounts was almost mature. Remembering the suffering he had endured from the owner in the past, he patted his chest and resolutely said, \"Our village has also decided to calculate!\"\n    The masses act\n    During the transformation of their thinking, the farmers in the village often chatted with the activists in the village, and Shen Yuzhen of Huzhuang often went to the village to resolutely enlighten them, so their thinking had changed. The accumulated hatred over the years aroused the urgent demand to calculate rent accounts with the owner. Several activists were discovered among the farmers in the village, such as Hu Dianyang, Hu Diancui, and Hu Dianbang.\n    After Hu Biyou made his decision, he immediately acted and convened a village meeting of all villagers. Hu Biyou asked, \"The whole Houzhuang has calculated their accounts. What should we do in our village?\" Then he pressed, \"Regardless of whether you calculate or not, I'm going to calculate!\" At this time, Hu Dianyang and Hu Diancui then said, \"When will we have to suffer? My family has also decided to calculate.\" So all the tenant farmers in the village demanded to calculate accounts with the owner. In the afternoon of the meeting, Comrade Chen went to Hulaozhuang again. The people in the village all gathered around and asked, \"Comrade Chen! How should we calculate the rent accounts in our village? Other families have already calculated them.\" Comrade Chen said, \"That depends on yourselves; do you have accounts to calculate?\" Everyone said in a hubbub, \"How can there be no accounts to calculate!

The clothing section workers actively responded to the call of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region to \"implement joint public-private management, 20-80 profit sharing, and launch a conservation campaign.\" They carefully studied clothing cutting techniques and put forward the slogan \"Don't waste a single scrap of cloth.\" Initially, the goal of making large clothes while saving cloth was achieved. Each set of clothing saves more than one square foot of cloth, totaling 33,000 square feet of cloth (including 20,000 square feet of foreign cloth) saved in the first half of the year. Calculating based on the August market price of 50 yuan per square foot of plain coarse cloth, a total of 1.65 million yuan was saved. The public share was 1.48 million yuan, and the workers' share was 170,000 yuan. If calculated based on the saved foreign cloth, the amount would be even higher.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: The peasants of Bin County, Songjiang Province, have created new methods for the reasonable distribution of enemy and puppet land. Taking Zhongchunling Village in Chang'an District as an example, the 171 landless peasant households in the village have been allocated 513 *xiang* of land (1 *xiang* equals 10 *mu*). Among them, 116 households were poor peasants, totaling 440 people, with an average of 7.2 *mu* per person. Fifty-eight tenant middle-peasant households, with 251 people, received an average of 4.4 *mu* per person. Seventeen tenant rich-peasant households, with 253 people, received an average of 4 *mu* per person. In the process of land distribution, the masses of the whole village were divided into four classes. The first class consisted of agricultural workers with no home or any property. It was stipulated that in addition to half a *xiang* of land per person, single individuals would receive an additional *xiang* of land, and families of two or more would receive an additional half *xiang* per family. This was to be used for purchasing the minimum amount of household necessities and long-term expenses for getting married. They were also allocated one or half a room, without having to find land elsewhere. The second class consisted of those who rented half a room and had a few of the most basic utensils. It was stipulated that in addition to half a *xiang* of land per person, each family would receive an additional *xiang* of land for settling down, and 2.5 *mu* would be deducted for each room allocated. The third class consisted of those who owned a house and a small number of landless people who did not rent land to cultivate. Each person was allocated half a *xiang* of land, but half a *xiang* of land would be deducted for each room allocated. The fourth class consisted of tenant rich peasants with carts and horses. Each person could be allocated half a *xiang* of land, and 3 *mu* of land would be deducted for each room and each head of livestock (the deduction would be reduced for old or sick livestock). This method was supported by all classes. Although the tenant rich peasants transferred some of the land they rented to others, they were happy that they had also been allocated land and that they had ample labor and means of production. As long as they worked diligently, each *xiang* of land could yield one and a half times the harvest of previous years, and their lives would still improve. After reasonably distributing the land, the peasants of the county went to work on their own land with redoubled efforts. Sun Kuangang, who had worked hard all his life, personally went to see the land immediately after it was allocated and began weeding in the field. Song Xifa worked as a laborer under the puppet Manchukuo regime and had his shoulder broken. Since he didn't have any land, he was worried about how he would survive the rest of his life. The government allocated him three *xiang* of land. Holding the land deed he saved, he said to the reporter, \"If it weren't for the Communist Party leading the people to turn over a new leaf, I, Song Xifa, would have starved to death soon, and I would never have been able to afford land in my next life.\" He immediately went back and bought paper, personally wrote a contract, and sent it to the Trade Union for forwarding to the county government.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 合理分配敌伪土地  宾县农民创造新办法\n\n1946-08-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　合理分配敌伪土地\n    宾县农民创造新办法\n    【新华社哈尔滨六日电】松江省宾县农民创造了合理分配敌伪土地的新办法。以常安区中春岭村为例，该村一百七十一户无地农民，已分到土地五百一十三垧（每垧十亩）。其中一百一十六户为贫农，共四百四十人，平均每人分得七亩二分。五十八户佃中农，二百五十一人，平均每人分得四亩四分。十七户佃富农，二百五十三人，平均每人得四亩。在分地过程中，把全村分地的群众分为四等，一等户是没有家、没有一点房屋财产的农业工人，规定除每人分半垧地外，单身者另给地一垧，二人以上者，每家另给一半地，做为购置最低限度的家庭日用品、及娶妻子的长期打算费用，并另分给一间或半间房子，不另找地。二等户本租住半间房，少有一些最简单的用具者，规定每人除分半垧地外，每家另给一垧安家地，每分一间房扣二亩五分地。三等户是自己有房、和少数无地房非租地种的，每人分地半垧，但分房一间需扣半垧地。四等户是有车马的佃富农，每人可分半垧地，一间房子，一个牲口扣三亩地（牲口老病者酌情减扣）。此办法得到各阶层的拥护，佃富农虽然把一部分租来的地转分给别人，但想到自己也分得了土地，自己有充分的劳动力和生产工具，只要勤劳耕种，每垧能抵往年一垧半的收成，生活还是向上的。该县农民在合理的分得土地后，到自己分得土地上去做活，加倍努力。一辈子苦活的孙宽刚，在刚分了土地后，亲自去看地，并马上开始在地里拔草。宋喜发在伪满时当劳工，被打断了肩膊，自己又没有一分地，正想着后半辈没法过活，政府给他分得三垧地。他拿着自己存的地约向记者说：“要不是共产党领导人民翻身，我宋喜发不多会儿就要饿死，再辈子也买不起地”。他马上又回去买了纸，亲手写契约送至职工联合会，转送县政府。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: The Chiang Kai-shek government's financial crisis is deepening with the continuation and expansion of the civil war. According to Shanghai newspapers, the actual expenditure for the first five months of this year, ending in May, has already exceeded the 250 million yuan that the authorities publicly announced as the entire year's budget. With prices continuing to rise, it is estimated that the average expenditure for the remaining seven months of this year will be at least double the average for the first five months. The total expenditure for the year will be at least 800 million *wan* yuan (three *wan* characters). The massive expenditure is caused by the civil war. Military expenses accounted for 60 percent of the total expenditure in the first five months of this year, and it is estimated that it will increase significantly in the second half of the year. However, in terms of the Chiang government's revenue, tax revenue calculated in currency can only offset 8 percent of the total expenditure. Even with the addition of enemy and puppet extortion and business income, the figure is still extremely large. According to Yu Hongjun's remarks quoted in the August 6th issue of the Shanghai *China Weekly Review*, the revenue for the first five months only offset 15 percent of the expenditure, and the remaining 85 percent had to rely on issuing currency. It is also learned that by the end of last year, the number of banknotes issued by the Kuomintang was 100.3 million *wan* yuan (more than 7,000 times the 140,000 *wan* yuan before the war). According to a special article in the Shanghai *Democracy* weekly on July 6th, it is estimated that by the end of this year, the number of issues will approach the astonishing figure of 200 million *wan* yuan (three *wan* characters).\n\nXinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: Shanghai News: Kuomintang comprador bureaucratic capital is monopolizing import businesses and serving the economic aggression of American imperialism. The vast majority of enemy and puppet industries have not yet resumed operations under their monopolistic takeover. In Shanghai alone, as of the end of May, after ten months, only 73 of the \"state-owned\" factories taken over had started operations, accounting for only 11 percent of the number of factories taken over. However, since the implementation of the controlled foreign exchange policy in early March, many large monopoly import companies have been organized by the descendants of bureaucrats. Kong Xiangxi's son, Kong Lingjue, organized the Yangtze Construction Company, with a capital of 500 million US dollars, which is equivalent to the amount of the Sino-US loan. Another company of Kong Xiangxi's is the Yangtze River Company. Currently, Kong Xiangxi has ordered a large number of warehouses from the United States in the name of the company, and recently ordered another batch of goods from the United States. The Yangtze River Company is the protagonist of the recent grain loan fraud case in Shanghai, which has been exposed by the inspector Cheng Zhongxing. Song Ziwen's brother, Song Ziliang, also organized a China Import and Export Trading Company. There is also a company with close ties to bureaucratic capital, the Fuzhong Company, which is run by the son of Yu Qiaqing and also engages in the import \"business.\" The Kong and Song financial groups have extremely close ties with the reactionary monopoly capital of the United States. They have a large amount of foreign exchange deposited in the United States, and can obtain foreign exchange supply from the Central Bank at will, and can also use the transportation tools of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Recently, a transport brigade including 230,000 tons of ships was established under the Relief Administration of the Executive Yuan as a tool to transport American goods to the interior for dumping. Shanghai democrats believe that the result of the Kong and Song comprador bureaucratic capital serving the dumping of American imperialist goods with all their strength will strangle national industry and lead to the collapse of the national economy.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Nanjing News: Wang Yunwu stated in an economic report at the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week yesterday that the Ministry of Economic Affairs received a total of 2,411 factory and mine units in Northeast China, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan, of which only 852 units have resumed operations, accounting for only 37 percent of the total received; in addition, 210 units that were not resumed by the Ministry also accounted for only 8 percent of the total received. And there are still 951 units of the received enterprises in various regions of the country that have not been processed.

    "title": "Persist in Guerrilla Warfare in Areas Occupied by the Kuomintang Reactionaries - Editorial of the Huazhong Xinhua Daily",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-09",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 6th: The Huazhong Xinhua Daily recently published an editorial entitled \"Persist in Guerrilla Warfare in Areas Occupied by the Kuomintang Reactionaries,\" pointing out that the occupation of some towns and villages in the Suwan Liberated Area by the reactionaries can only be a temporary phenomenon. The military and civilians of Suwan have won democracy and freedom in the life-and-death struggle against the enemy, puppets, and all evil forces, and will never tolerate the barbaric rule, enslavement, and plunder of the reactionaries. We will continue to use the old magic weapon that we used to defeat the Japanese invaders in the past, that is, to persist in and expand guerrilla warfare until the reactionaries are eliminated or driven out.\n\nThe editorial then listed many favorable conditions for carrying out guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas:\n\nFirst, the reactionaries are isolated and helpless among the people. They are in an antagonistic position with the broad masses of the people. The troops of the reactionaries, who are divorced from the masses, almost 100% of the soldiers and many middle and lower-level officers are disgusted with the civil war. Because the reactionaries have limited troops, they cannot be used in a dispersed manner, thus weakening their control over the occupied areas. This is an objective favorable condition for persisting in guerrilla warfare.\n\nSecond, the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan have tempered the people of the Liberated Areas. In the struggle against the Japanese invaders and improving their own lives, they have raised their awareness, strengthened their organization, and accumulated experience, and have the confidence, strength, and methods to deal with their enemies. This is the social foundation for persisting in guerrilla warfare.\n\nThird, in most of the occupied areas, we have county and district backbone armed forces, and a relatively widespread militia organization. These people's armed forces grew up during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. This is the armed foundation for us to persist in guerrilla warfare.\n\nFourth, we have local cadres who were born and raised here, who not only have years of struggle experience, but also have an inseparable connection with the masses. This is the organizational foundation for us to persist in guerrilla warfare.\n\nFifth, this kind of guerrilla warfare is not isolated and helpless. It has a vast area without enemies to rely on, and a strong main force fighting on the main battlefield, playing a decisive role in coordination. This is the surrounding environment for us to persist in guerrilla warfare.\n\nAfter listing these favorable conditions, the editorial believes that the following efforts should also be added subjectively:\n\nFirst, we must further rely on the masses and use the path of the masses. Everything should proceed from the interests of the masses, universally arouse the hatred of the masses, oppose \"left\" and right deviations, and unite local mass leaders, militias, and the broad masses of the people like family and sons.\n\nSecond, prevent a purely military point of view. The armed forces in the occupied areas must become armed political work teams, and use various methods to win over all peace-loving and democratic troops and people from all walks of life to the anti-civil war front, and launch the Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, and Liu Shanben movements everywhere. Even if he is a soldier, a \"member of the armed home return group,\" regardless of his past, as long as he opposes the civil war today, we will sincerely welcome him.\n\nThird, strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and guerrilla tactics, flexibly apply them to actual struggles, and launch a mass \"unpredictable\" guerrilla war: sometimes attacking the enemy in front, sometimes attacking the enemy in the rear, sometimes concentrating on attacking the enemy at one point, and sometimes dispersing and harassing everywhere, making the other side feel that there are enemies everywhere and unable to figure out the real situation, in order to achieve the purpose of confusing, containing, exhausting, and consuming the invaders. On the one hand, the reactionary occupation areas cannot expand further, and the landlords and gentry cannot collect grain and wealth, the people are still ours, and the villages are still ours. On the other hand, it gives great convenience to the main force's combat. Only when the guerrilla warfare of the local armed forces is coordinated with the mobile warfare of the main force can we carry out large-scale self-defense wars more powerfully.\n\nThe editorial finally emphasized: The reactionaries are not stronger than the Japanese invaders, and the people's strength is much stronger than during the War of Resistance Against Japan. As long as we are good at using various favorable conditions, relying on the masses, and extensively launching and persisting in guerrilla warfare, we can not only drive the reactionaries out of the occupied areas, but it will not take too long. Oh! I hope we can cleverly use all kinds of favorable conditions to rely on the masses and extensively launch and persist in guerrilla warfare, not only can we drive the reactionaries out of the occupied areas, but it will not take too long.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 坚持被国民党反动派侵占地区的游击战争  华中新华日报社论\n\n1946-08-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　坚持被国民党反动派侵占地区的游击战争\n    华中新华日报社论\n    【新华社淮阴六日电】华中新华日报顷以“坚持被国民党反动派侵占地区的游击战争”为题，发表社论，指出苏皖解放区若干城镇村庄之被反动派侵占，只能是暂时的现象。苏皖军民在与敌伪及一切恶势力的生死斗争中，获得了民主自由，决不能再容忍反动派的野蛮统治奴役和掠夺。我们将继续使用过去曾用于战胜日寇的老法宝，即坚持与扩大游击战争，直到把反动派消灭或赶出为止。\n    该社论继列举在被侵占地区进行游击战争的许多有利条件：\n    第一，反动派在人民中间是孤立寡助的。他们和广大人民处于敌对地位。脱离群众的反动派的部队，几乎百分之百的战士和许多中下级军官都厌恶内战。反动派因为兵力有限，势不能分散使用，因此便减弱对于侵占地区的控制力。这是坚持游击战争的客观有利条件。\n    第二，八年抗战锻炼了解放区的人民。在对日寇战斗与改善自己生活的斗争中，提高了觉悟，加强了组织，积累了经验，有信心，有力量，有办法对付他们的敌人。这是坚持游击战争的社会基础。\n    第三，在被侵占的绝大部分地区，我们都有县、区的基干武装部队，有比较普遍的民兵组织，这些人民武装，是在八年抗战中生长起来的，这就是我们坚持游击战争的武装基础。\n    第四，我们有土生土长的地方干部，不但有多年的斗争经验，而且与群众有血肉不可分离的联系。这就是我们坚持游击战争的组织基础。\n    第五，这种游击战不是孤立无援的，有广大的没有敌人的地区可以依托，有坚强的主力在主要战场作战，起着决定性的配合作用。这就是我们坚持游击战的周围环境。\n    该社论列举这些有利条件之后，认为主观上还应加上如下的努力：\n    第一，要进一步的依靠群众与运用群众的路。一切从群众的利益出发，普遍的发动群众同仇敌忾心理，反对“左”右偏向，团结当地群众领袖、民兵和广大人民，像家人父子一样。\n    第二，防止单纯的军事观点。被侵占区的武装要成为武装政治工作队，要用各种办法争取一切爱好和平民主的部队和各阶层人士到反内战的战线上来，到处掀起反内战的高树勋、潘朔端、刘善本运动。那怕他是一个战士，一个“武装还乡团员”，不问其过去如何，只要他今天反对内战，我们就要竭诚欢迎。\n    第三，加强学习毛主席的战略思想与游击战术，把它灵活地运用到实际斗争中去，展开群众性的“神出鬼没”的游击战争：时而击敌前，时而击敌后，时而集中打敌一点，时而分散四处扰乱，使对方感觉到处都是敌人，到处摸不清真实情况，以达到迷惑、牵制、疲惫与消耗侵犯者。一方面使反动派占领地区不能更大的扩张，也能使地主绅士们的政权不能收到粮食资财，人民还是我们的，乡村还是我们的。另方面给主力作战以极大的便利。只有地方武装的游击战与主力军的运动战配合起来，才能更强有力地进行大规模的自卫战争。\n    该社论最后着重指出：反动派并不比日寇强大，而人民的力量则比抗战时期更强大得多。只要我们善于运用各种有利条件，依靠群众，广泛地展开与坚持游击战争，不但可以把反动派从被侵占地区赶出去，而且为时不会太长。唷Ｖ灰?颐巧朴谠擞酶髦钟欣?跫??揽咳褐冢?惴旱卣箍?爰?持游击战争，不但可以把反动派从被侵占地区赶出去，而且为时不会太长。"

    "content": "Confessing Mistakes Franky Still Makes You a Good Person\nCongcun Village Puppet Personnel Voluntarily Request Removal of the Label\n[This newspaper, Handan News] Under the leadership and education of the government, former puppet army personnel in Congcun Village have confessed their mistakes to the Farmers' Association one after another, and have recently participated in the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. There were 160 puppet army members in the village in the past (out of just over 500 households in the entire village). Except for a very few who were running dogs of traitors and local bullies, who had acted tyrannically and oppressed the masses, the majority were poor peasants who were oppressed and exploited. They were forced to become puppet soldiers due to the enemy's and puppets' \"selling soldiers,\" dispatching soldiers, and conscripting soldiers. Because these people had worn the shameful hat of \"puppet soldier,\" the masses hated them when they were mentioned. Therefore, all of them were excluded from the mass emancipation movement. Recently, when the Farmers' Association was rectified in the village and a new struggle was brewing, they confessed to the Farmers' Association and requested to participate in the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. At the grievance-airing meeting for puppet army personnel, Jiang Tianguang said sadly: \"I sold myself as a soldier three times, all because there was nothing to eat. My father said: 'It's better to sell yourself as a soldier so everyone can find a way to survive than to starve to death together at home.' But the last time the selling price was 30,000 yuan, the Bao chief kept delaying payment.” Zhao Bangchen said sadly: \"The township head Zhao Zhenxiang, Bao chief Wang Qin, etc., forced me to pay grain. Because I couldn't afford it, they punched and kicked my father. I had no choice but to become a puppet soldier to pay off the debt.\" Li Shangzhi tearfully angrily said that his family had no house or land, and could not stand the extortion of traitors, so he became a puppet soldier. Because he heard that the Eighth Route Army worked for the poor, he contacted the Eighth Route Army staff. Later, he was discovered by the company commander, who beat him to a bloody pulp. These complaints reminded everyone of the sad things that happened in the past when they were bullied by traitors and local bullies at home; forced to become puppet soldiers; and bullied by Japanese devils and puppet officials. They realized that they were also oppressed and exploited people, and only by airing grievances with the masses and overthrowing traitors and local bullies could they wash away the bad name of \"puppet soldier\" and be emancipated. The masses also felt that these were their own class brothers who should be united, \"take off their hats\" and be emancipated together. Those who had done some bad things felt even more sorry for the masses and voluntarily confessed their mistakes. Now, more than 50 people have been approved to join the Farmers' Association, and Jiang Tianguang has been elected as the leader of the Farmers' Association group. A number of activists have also emerged in the recent anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement. The confession movement of puppet army personnel in the village is now developing along with the anti-traitor movement.

The District Party Committee Office and the Research Office are busy summarizing the mass emancipation movement of the first half of the year. Based on this summary, they are clarifying achievements and shortcomings, and are making every effort to guide the even more ambitious emancipation movement in the next half year. It is reported that the Taihang emancipation movement in the first half of the year has achieved great results, but this summary shows that it is still far from meeting the demands of the masses for emancipation. Of the 37 new district counties and cities in the region, only Wu'an, Anyang, Changzhi, Lucheng, Cixian, Heshun, Xiyang, Xiangyuan, Shahe, and Xingtai have resolved most of the land issues when settling accounts for the blood and tears of various forms of exploitation. The remaining counties are much worse, and some counties have not even resolved the land issue at all, so the masses are basically still not emancipated. Based on these circumstances, the District Party Committee is calling on cadres to clear their minds and resolutely strive to complete the great cause of mass emancipation in the next half year.\n\n    The Taihang Xinhua Daily specifically titled an article \"In the Face of Intense Self-Defense Warfare, It Is Necessary to More Boldly Implement Mass Movements in the New District,\" calling for a thorough settlement of accounts for emancipation and resolving the land demands of farmers. It also pointed out that the development of the mass movement in this district, except for a portion that has already realized \"land to the tiller\" and transitioned to production movements, is mostly in the stage of in-depth movement. In some areas, the masses have been mobilized and some problems have been solved, but feudal tenant relations still exist in 40 percent [of cases], and the resolved land issues (excluding non-landlord relations of orphans and widows) only account for 38.5 percent. Some small and medium landlords have not yet reduced rent and interest, and cunning landlords are attempting to preserve feudal exploitation... Therefore, it is necessary to settle accounts for rent reduction and resolve the land issue, so that the masses can be thoroughly emancipated.\n\n    The Administrative Office and the Political Department of the Military Region, in order to accomplish this great historical mission, jointly formed an \"emancipation team\" of more than 30 people, who are reportedly heading to the Fourth Military Sub-district within two or three days to help the masses emancipate themselves. The Second Military Sub-district formed an \"emancipation team\" of more than 400 people from students of the Taihang Second and Third Middle Schools and trainees from the Prefectural Party Committee Rectification Class. They completed their training at the end of last month and immediately went to Taigu, Yuci, and other counties to mobilize the masses to emancipate themselves. After returning from studying at the District Party Committee, the county party committees are holding cadre meetings and running emancipation training classes, summarizing the situation and problems of the first half-year movement, and preparing to set off a great emancipation upsurge in the entire district in the second half of the year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行总结半年群运  决即贯彻耕者有其田  各级领导机关纷组翻身队下乡\n\n1946-08-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行总结半年群运\n    决即贯彻耕者有其田\n    各级领导机关纷组翻身队下乡\n    【本报讯】为了群众翻身伟业迅速彻底胜利，太行全区党政军民各级干部在炎热的伏天里紧张的奔忙着。区党委办公室与调查研究室，正忙着总结前半年的群众翻身运动，从总结的基础上，明确成绩与缺点，全力指导今后半年内更宏伟的翻身运动。据悉：太行前半年翻身运动是有很大成绩的，但从这次总结中看出距群众的翻身要求还很远，全区新区三十七个县市中，只有武安、安阳、长治、潞城、磁县、和顺、昔阳、襄垣、沙河、邢台等十余县在清算各种剥削之血泪帐时，解决了大部土地问题，其余各县就差得很，有些县甚至根本没有解决土地问题，群众基本上仍未翻身。区党委根据这些情况，号召干部清醒头脑，坚决在今后半年内努力完成群众翻身伟业。\n    太行新华日报顷特以“紧张的自卫战争面前必需更加放手贯彻新区群众运动”为题，号召彻底进行清算翻身，解决农民土地要求。并指出本区群运的开展，除一部分已实现了耕者有其田转入生产运动者外，大部处于深入运动的阶段。有些地区群众发动了，也解决了一些问题，但封建租佃关系尚存在百分之四十，被解决的土地问题（除孤寡户非地主关系者外），仅占百分之三八·五。若干中小地主尚没减租息，狡猾的地主企图保存封建剥削…………因此必需清算减租解决土地问题，使群众彻底翻身。\n    行署与军区政治部，为完成这一伟大历史任务，合组翻身队三十余人，闻两三日内即赶赴四分区帮助群众翻身。二分区由太行二、三中学校学生及地委整风班学员共四百余人组成翻身队，已于上月底集训完毕，当即分赴太谷、榆次等县发动群众翻身。各县县委在区党委学习完毕回去后，正召开干部会与开办翻身训练班，总结前半年运动情况与问题，准备着掀起全区后半年的大翻身浪潮。"

    "content": "The Story of Little Shandong's Transformation\n    ——An Example of Reforming Prisoners at Zhangjiakou Prison\n\n    Twenty-two-year-old Zhu Yuancai had already been a thief for thirteen years. He was from Penglai, Shandong. He lost his father at six and his mother at seven, leaving this orphan without any affection in the world, drifting into beggary. At the age of nine, he stole two silver dollars from a paternal relative and secretly jumped onto a sailboat crossing the Bohai Bay, escaping to Dalian, thus beginning his thieving career. Here, he found a group of companions. During the day, they stole things to fill their bellies; at night, they slept on the streets, hunger forcing them to steal even more. During his first winter in Dalian, they began stealing from the courtyards of wealthy people. Although young, Zhu Yuancai was bold. He would always sneak deep into the inner rooms late at night, carrying out large packages from the window and handing them to his companions. However, he didn’t demand a larger share of the loot despite doing the most dangerous work. Therefore, his companions respected him and gave him a friendly nickname, \"Little Shandong.\"\n\n    When \"Little Shandong\" was eleven years old, he became addicted to opium. It quickly ruined his health. His sworn brother, Ma Bikan, advised him to quit. He agreed and asked his friends to tie him to a tree, not allowing anyone to untie him for three whole days, thus breaking his opium addiction. At fourteen, he was imprisoned in Dalian once. Afterwards, he fled to Beijing and then to Datong. At seventeen, he escaped to Zhangjiakou and stayed between there and Beijing, making a living as a thief.\n\n    Shortly after the liberation of Zhangjiakou, Zhu Yuancai was reported and sentenced to one year of imprisonment. As in the past, he thought that as long as he spent some money in prison and stayed for a few months, he could get out and resume his \"divine hand\" career. But this time, Zhu Yuancai encountered new problems. First, no one put shackles or handcuffs on him; no one beat or scolded him; and no one asked him for money. The millet he ate was clean and fragrant. The prison cells were painted snow-white, much cleaner than the places he had lived outside. Many prisoners happily went to work after eating. They were given lessons every day, discussing national affairs, the darkness of the old society, and the benefits of labor. The prison had loudspeakers broadcasting news all day long… All of this confused Zhu Yuancai. What was going on? A few days later, Director Liu of the prison guards had a long talk with him, telling him that the democratic government's prison was a place to heal and save people. He explained that being a thief was mainly caused by the oppression of the old society, and that as long as he could reform, he could still be a good person… Zhu Yuancai listened very carefully. Director Liu's sincere and caring attitude deeply moved him. He felt that since his parents died, no one had cared for him so warmly. He felt that these words were all for his own good. He didn't sleep all night, thinking that it was indeed time for him to reform.\n\n    When Zhu Yuancai arrived at the construction team, Director Liu saw that his shoes were almost worn out and immediately issued him a new pair. The captain of the construction team was Director Liu himself. He often talked to Zhu Yuancai, caring about his life. Zhu Yuancai felt that Director Liu was like a relative to him. He told him everything about his past deeds. Director Liu also told him many stories about the liberated areas. Zhu Yuancai then resolved to change.\n\n    When carrying white soil, others carried one basket, but he discussed with his partner to carry two baskets. While others returned with empty baskets, Zhu Yuancai carried yellow soil back to \"mix the mud.\" Later, others followed Zhu Yuancai and carried two baskets, but he added another basket, running out and running back. Zhu Yuancai developed a large boil on his arm and his hands were blistered. Director Liu advised him to rest, but he said, \"It's okay, it will be fine in a few days.\" Sure enough, it was all healed in half a month. His arm didn't hurt anymore, a layer of calluses grew on his hands, and he felt particularly strong. Everyone in the construction team admired him and elected him as the group leader. This spring, Zhu Yuancai led a construction team of nearly twenty people to work on Xuanhua Avenue, Yi'an Street, and other places. These places were six *li* away from the prison, and no one from the prison followed them. They went out in the morning and returned in the evening, and no one ever ran away. Because Zhu Yuancai reformed well, the local court decided to release him early, but Zhu Yuancai did not want to leave. He asked the government for a job. Thus, Zhu Yuancai officially became a prison guard in May of this year. Zhu Yuancai's work involved mainly dealing with petty thieves, and of course, all the tricks of the trade could not be hidden from him. Now, many of the petty thieves in Zhangjiakou Prison are Zhu Yuancai's former companions. Recently, in order to more effectively reform petty thieves, the prison specially established a transformation team, led by Zhu Yuancai. This transformation team lives in a separate room with freedom of movement.

    "content": "Paying Back Debts of Blood and Settling Grievances\n    The Unfolding of the Liquidation Movement in Jiang County\n    [This newspaper's Yangcheng News] Before the liberation of Jiang County seat, the people of Jiang County had engaged in a long and arduous struggle against the enemy, puppets, traitors, bullies and landlords. After the county seat was liberated, the mass movement unfolded like a raging fire. When the Japanese bandits surrendered last year, the traitor Chen Ziwen refused to surrender his weapons and intensified his espionage activities, dispatching armed plainclothes agents in groups of two or three every night to carry out assassinations everywhere. At that time, our leading comrades, in this difficult environment, organized the masses to persist in the struggle and assured the masses, \"We will share life and death, and we will never retreat!\" The morale of the masses was consolidated, and they expressed their determination to fight to the death. In the past year of struggle, they created many self-defense methods, such as: 1. Defending the fortresses: Militiamen and activists would gather in sturdy, good courtyards at night, and weapons would be prepared before sleep. If anything happened, they would go to the roof and throw grenades down. Chen's armed agents were repelled by the masses in this way many times. 2. Repairing walls: Many villages automatically repaired and strengthened their walls, making it impossible for agents to sneak in at night. 3. Organizing joint village defense and combining with the troops to carry out tenacious armed battles. This greatly strengthened the masses' will to fight and confidence in victory, and at the same time gave the cadres great encouragement. On June 20th, we liberated Jiang County seat. The leadership then put forward the slogan \"Sow seeds everywhere, grow crops everywhere,\" \"Pay back debts of blood, settle grievances,\" so that the masses' anger of revenge immediately burned fiercely on a county-wide scale. On the 5th of last month, a mass meeting of ten thousand people in the urban area denounced the heinous crimes of five major traitors, including Cao Tianxiang, and executed them by firing squad on the spot. In the half month since then, ninety villages (half of all the villages in the county) have quickly launched struggles against traitors and bullies, and for rent reduction and debt liquidation. Many village-level regimes controlled by traitors and bullies have been transformed. The land that landlords and local tyrants had mortgaged to farmers at low prices during the enemy and puppet period in order to transfer burdens, with the intention of taking it back at any time, has now been re-established with lease terms of more than five years. For those who farmed to pay grain (ostensibly renting, but in reality all the grain collected was plundered in the name of burden), in addition to some tenants calculating their wages with the landlords as hired laborers, most adopted the method of \"rent calculated as rent (according to rent reduction standards), grain payments calculated as grain payments,\" and settled accounts separately. In villages where the issue of rent and interest has been resolved, the lives of farmers have been improved, their class status is rapidly rising, extreme poverty is tending to be eliminated, the number of poor peasants is decreasing, and the number of middle peasants is rapidly increasing. In Zhengchai, Chaquan, and Fancun villages, the original thirty-one extremely poor households have been reduced to only one; the original ten tenant farmer households have become self-cultivating farmers. The number of middle peasants has increased from the original one hundred and sixty-two to two hundred and thirty-five. The county-wide mass movement is now developing in a comprehensive and in-depth manner.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 有仇报仇有冤报冤  绛县清算运动展开\n\n1946-08-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　有仇报仇有冤报冤\n    绛县清算运动展开\n    【本报阳城讯】绛县人民在县城解放之前，曾与敌伪奸霸地主进行了长期的苦斗，县城解放后，群运即如烈火一般的展开。去年日寇投降，汉奸陈子文不肯缴枪，并加紧特务活动，每黑夜三三两两派出武装便衣，到处进行暗杀活动。当时我领导同志在这艰苦环境里组织群众坚持斗争，并向群众保证“同生死、共患难，决不退走！”群众情绪巩固了，表示要誓死奋斗到底。在一年来的斗争中，创造了很多自卫办法，如：一、守堡子：民兵与积极分子晚间集中睡在坚固的好院里，武器都在睡前准备好。一有事就上房往下打手榴弹。陈逆的武装特务，曾多次被群众这样打退。二、修围墙：不少村庄自动把围墙修好，修结实，使特务无法夜间窜入。三、组织联村联防，与部队结合，进行了顽强的武装战斗。大大坚定了群众的斗争意志与胜利信心，同时给了干部以极大鼓舞。六月二十日我解放了绛县城，领导上即提出“到处撒种子、到处长庄稼”、“有仇报仇、有冤报冤”的口号，使群众复仇的怒火立即以全县的规模猛烈燃烧起来。上月五日城关万人大会控诉曹天祥等五个大汉奸的滔天罪行，并当场执行枪决后，半月多来，很快即有九十个村庄（占全县村庄之半）掀起反汉奸、反恶霸与减租清债的斗争。许多汉奸恶霸把持的村级政权被改造了。敌伪时期地主豪绅们为转嫁负担而低价当给农民准备随时夺回的土地，现在都重订了五年以上的典期。以前种地顶粮（表面是租种，实际所收粮食全被以负担名义掠去）的，除部分佃户作为雇工向地主算回工价外，大部采取“租算租（按减租标准）、粮款算粮款”的办法，分头算了账。租息问题已获解决的村庄，农民生活都得到改善，成分在很快上升，赤贫趋向消灭，贫农在减少，中农在迅速增加。郑柴、槎泉、范村等三村，原来三十一户赤贫，现在只剩了一户；原来十户佃农，现在成了自耕农。中农由原来的一百六十二户增至二百三十五户。全县群运，现正向普遍与深入发展中。"

    "content": "The main task of propaganda work in carrying out the movement is to ignite the fire and create a large-scale mass emancipation movement. Wu'an has gained the following three experiences in this regard:\n\nI. Concentrate the wisdom of the masses and use their own words to awaken them.\n\n1. Use the vivid words of the masses to break down their ideas of conscience, fate, and sentiment. For example, an old farmhand from Yunjialing said: \"I built a house for the shopkeeper and went blind. Not only did he not give me wages, but he didn't even give me food and kicked me out. I suffered in his house for many years. Is this conscience?\" Tenant farmers in Chengbei Township discussed fate and said: \"If we seize the grain and don't hand it over to the landlord, let's see if he gets poor. If he can get poor too, then it's not good fate.\" They also said: \"In the past, poor people were not as valuable as a handful of wheat straw to the rich. The landlords squeezed us like they were trying to get four ounces of oil out of buckwheat husks. What sentiment is there?\" Regarding who depends on whom for a living, a landlord from Boyan said: \"Everything you stand on and everything above you is mine.\" The tenant farmers retorted: \"If it weren't for us outside households, the landlord wouldn't even have cool water to drink.\" In the joint urban-rural struggle, the landlord Chang Xinghan admitted: \"I overcharged for food and tea money and bought land.\" The tenant farmers said: \"No wonder the landlords can get rich, they overcharge us and buy land to exploit us again.\" Regarding the idea of changing the world, activists said: \"If we turn ourselves around and buy guns, we will shoot anyone who comes to sabotage us. If we fight, the Eighth Route Army will come to help us.\" \"Our hatred is the government's hatred, and the government will definitely stand up for us.\" \"There are many of us poor people, if we organize the militia well, what are we afraid of if the reactionaries attack?\"\n\n2. Turn the words of the masses into slogans for mass action. \"Rent reduction is reducing your own [burden],\" \"Overthrowing rent is overthrowing resentment,\" \"Accounts must be settled clearly, and reasons must be explained fully,\" \"If we want something, we all go together, so they have no way to retaliate,\" \"Don't be afraid of being fanned with a fan even if your head is broken, don't be afraid of floods when crossing the river,\" \"Reason is spoken by everyone, accounts are calculated by everyone, and getting things done requires everyone's effort.\"\n\n3. Promote the masses' simple policy ideas and educate them through action. Regarding the landlord's side: \"The bigger the tree, the more land it takes up, and the big landlords exploit more poor people,\" \"Walnuts and dates cannot be counted the same way, there is a difference between big and small landlords,\" \"Tit for tat, softness for softness,\" \"The more enlightened, the more concessions,\" \"Struggle against those who are stubborn,\" \"Concede when you are in the right,\" \"Gold at home needs to be weighed, pretending to be stupid is useless.\"\n\nRegarding the unity of the peasants: \"People who are not relatives are relatives by occupation, people who pick up manure see people carrying baskets as relatives,\" \"The Farmers' Association is our time, if the Farmers' Association is disbanded, there will be no time,\" \"If the special agents sabotage our Farmers' Association, they are kicking away our rice bowls,\" \"Point the guns outward, don't stab yourself in the leg,\" \"If we organize, we can be masters of our own house,\" \"If the cadres are not united, the masses are like doing business without capital,\" \"The cadres are leading the work, but everyone has to do the hoeing,\" \"After the cadres turn themselves around, they must not forget the poor people,\" \"Turning oneself around is not just about getting things, poor people don't fight for profit.\"\n\nII. The masses encourage each other and praise themselves:\n\nIn the joint urban-rural struggle in Wu'an, activists from the People's Association said to their members: \"People are not afraid of changing the world and don't talk about sentiment. What are we afraid of?\" Then the People's Association moved completely. After the struggle in Xiaowang, the activists encouraged each other and said: \"The landlords are unreasonable, we are reasonable, truth overcomes unreasonableness.\" The tenant farmer activists in Nantian Village encouraged the masses and said: \"My problem has been solved, why don't you speak up about your big grievances?\" The workers' leader in Shaozhuang encouraged the workers and said: \"We kiln workers wear felt hats and blue clothes, carry flat axes and lanterns, although we cannot go to heaven to see the Jade Emperor, we can also go underground to dig out five metals.\" After the rent reduction victory, the masses' enthusiasm for turning themselves around was overflowing everywhere, and they praised each other: \"In previous years, the twelfth lunar month was like burning oil in the heart, this year we had a good autumn in the twelfth lunar month.\" Women from the same association said: \"I have traveled east and west, and gone to the Cizhou market, but I have never participated in such a good struggle meeting.\" The peasants said: \"As long as I can remember, I have never been as happy as this year for the New Year.\" When the masses elected Song Er from the same association as a county councilor, he said excitedly: \"I have been farming in Xiaozhang Village for seventeen years, and I was a top hand, but I ended up begging with my wife and children. When the Eighth Route Army came, I became a councilor. I have really turned myself around.\"\n\nIII. Create a new public opinion of turning oneself around and leave a deep impression of turning oneself around.\n\nWhen the masses take action in rent reduction, there will be new public opinion: \"Chairman Mao is calling for turning oneself around,\" \"The Communist Party and the people are of one heart,\" \"When the Communist Party comes, good times come, with the Eighth Route Army, there are saviors,\" Intermediate figures also said: \"The government is protecting the business, not the people,\" \"The Eighth Route Army first appeases the people wherever they go, the Central Army first enjoys themselves wherever they go,\" \"It is right for our Eighth Route Army to succeed, in the past people could never be united, now people are united.\" During the New Year's entertainment, the masses in each village enthusiastically held celebrations of turning themselves around. The masses carried out costume performances, exhibitions of struggle fruits, and rent reduction commemorative badges, all of which left a deep impression. In the \"New Wu'an Rent Reduction Song,\" the masses sang: \"Unite, our strength is great, rent reduction depends on ourselves, be bold, don't be afraid of anything.\" These all played a profound role in mobilizing the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武安新区发动群众鼓动工作的经验\n王庭栋\n1946-08-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武安新区发动群众鼓动工作的经验\n    在开展运动中，鼓动工作的主要任务，是点起火来，造成大规模的群众翻身运动。这点武安已获如下三点经验：\n    一、集中群众的聪明，用群众自己的话，点醒群众。\n    １、用群众生动的话打破群众良心命运情面思想。如云驾岭老雇工说：“我给掌柜家盖房子，弄瞎眼，不但不给工资，连饭也不给吃，就撵出我来了，我在他家受苦多年，这就是良心？”城北乡佃户们讨论命运说：“咱打下粮食不交给地主，看他穷了穷不了，如果也能穷，就不是好命。”他们又说：“过去穷人不如老财一把麦秸值钱，地主对咱是荞麦皮还榨四两油，有什么情面？”关于谁靠谁过活，伯延地主说：“你头顶足踏都是我的”，佃户们反驳说：“没有咱外来户，地主凉水也喝不上。”城乡联合斗争中，地主常兴韩承认说：“我多要了饭茶钱，又买成了地”，佃户说：“怪不得地主能发财，多要了咱的钱，买成地再剥削咱。”对变天思想，积极分子说：“咱翻了身买下枪，谁来破坏就打谁，咱打起来，八路军就来帮助了”。“咱的仇恨，就是政府的仇恨，政府一定给咱作主”，“咱穷人多，组织好民兵，反动派打来，还怕什么？”\n    ２、把群众的话，变成群众行动的口号。“减租是减自己的”，“倒租倒仇气”，“算帐要清，理要说尽”，“要上一齐上，叫他想报仇也没办法”，“打破头不怕扇子扇，过河不怕大水淹”，“理是大家说，帐是大家算，要东西还得大家干。”\n    ３、发扬群众中朴素的政策思想，在行动中教育群众，对地主方面：“树大拔地多，大地主剥削的穷人多”，“核桃枣不能一律数，大小地主有分别”，“硬对硬，软对软”，“越开明越让步”，“谁顽固再斗”，“得理让步”，“家有黄金外有称，装蒜捣鬼不中用”。\n    对农民团结方面：“人不亲行亲，拾大粪的看见拿箩头的亲”，“农会是咱的时光，农会解散了就没时光”，“特务破坏咱农会，就是踢咱们的饭碗”，“枪口对外，刀子不往自己腿上插”，“组织起来就会当家”，“干部不团结，群众就是作买卖没本钱”，“干部是领工的，锄地还得大家干”，“干部翻了身，不能忘穷人”，“翻身不光要东西，穷人一家不争利”。\n    二、群众互相打气，自己歌颂：\n    武安城乡联合斗争中，平民会的积极分子向自己的会员说：“人家就不怕变天，不讲情面，咱还怕什么？”于是平民会全动起来。小汪斗争后，积极分子打气说：“地主是横理，咱们是真理，真理说倒了横理。”南田村佃户积极分子鼓励群众说：“我的问题解决了，你们这大冤枉还不说吗”？邵庄工人领袖鼓励工人说：咱们窑工是头戴毡帽身穿青，腰压扁斧手提灯，虽不能上天朝玉皇，也能下地刨五金。减租胜利后，群众翻身情绪，倒处洋溢，互相歌颂：“往年过腊月滚油烧心，今年腊月里过了一个好秋”。同会妇女说：“走过东到过西，赶过磁州集，没参加过这么好的斗争会。”农民们说：“从我记事起，就没今年过年高兴。”同会宋二的当翻身群众把他选成县参议员时，他兴奋的说：“我在小章村种地十七年，头等把式，结果领老婆孩子要饭出来，八路军来了，我当了参议员，真翻身了”。\n    三、创造翻身新舆论，留下翻身深印象。\n    群众在减租中行动起来，就有了新的舆论：“毛主席叫翻身”，共产党老百姓一条心”，“来了共产党，来了好时光，有了八路军，有了救命人”，中间人士也说：“政府是护理不护人”，“八路军到那先安民，中央军到那先享福”，“就该咱们八路军成事哩，过去人心总不能齐，如今人都齐心了”。年关娱乐中，各村群众都热烈的举行着翻身庆祝大会，群众们都进行化装表演，斗争果实展览会，减租纪念章等都留下了深刻的印象，在“新武安减租歌”中，群众这样唱着：团结起来力量大，减租减息靠自家，大胆起来吧，什么也不怕。这些都在群众中，起了深刻的鼓动作用。"

According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 21st, senior U.S. officials are considering completely ceasing the shipment of military supplies and arms to the Chinese government. The Associated Press stated: According to news from Washington, the majority of weapons under the U.S. Lend-Lease Act have made the Kuomintang extremists even more arrogant, which will transform the scattered battles in various places into a full-scale civil war in China, and U.S. policy will inevitably fail as a result. Washington officials are generally considering the issue of prohibiting the shipment of military supplies and arms to China in a situation of despair. The value of the U.S. Lend-Lease materials, including military supplies, received by the Kuomintang government is more than $1.5 billion. \"Certain authorities in Washington firmly believe that if the Kuomintang army were not so well-equipped, it might be more amenable to calls for cooperation with the Communist Party.\" The dispatch concluded: \"A full-scale civil war in China will raise some extremely delicate issues for U.S. foreign policy, namely, if the U.S. aids Chiang, will the Soviet Union aid the Communists? Can the UN organization do anything about a civil war in one of the five major powers?\" A United Press report on July 24th stated: \"As news of escalating military actions between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party floods in, some authoritative officials have begun to discuss: If the Chinese side publicly announces a civil war, what actions can the United States take? The discussion seems to follow two main lines: First, if the situation is beyond repair, can the United States continue to aid Chiang? And should the United States adopt other attitudes? Such as possibly recognizing the CCP as a legitimate belligerent party.\" The dispatch also stated: \"Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching Ling's declaration that reactionary elements in China and the United States seem eager for war and calling on the United States to stop aiding the Kuomintang government seems to have further agitated the situation in Washington.\"\n    \n    Another dispatch from the Ta Kung Pao's New York correspondent on July 24th stated: \"The reporter spoke with a senior U.S. official on the 23rd, who said: 'Hoping for a peaceful, democratic, and unified China is not only beneficial to the United States politically and economically, but also beneficial to the entire Far East and the world. It is impossible for the United States to help one party in China eliminate another party.'\"\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th.

    "content": "Xu \"Tiger\" Returns to Village to Confess Mistakes\n    Masses Cheer: \"The Eighth Route Army Has Educated the Bad Guys Well!\"\n    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] As the mass movement deepens, in the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district, soldiers who had previously eaten the enemy's or puppet's grain, and who had harmed the interests of the masses in the past, have been actively asking for leave to return to their villages to confess their wrongdoings to the masses. Through concessions by the masses and mediation by cadres, many outstanding issues in the villages have been resolved. The progress of this work has further united the military and the people, and further consolidated the troops. The report regarding Xu \"Tiger,\" a soldier in the Xiuwu Independent Battalion, returning to his village to confess is as follows: Xu is from Henghe Bian Village in Xiuwu. Due to difficult living conditions, he joined the puppet bandit Liu Mingde's unit and participated in several acts of plunder and murder against the village. This spring, during the \"anti-奸\" (anti-traitor) and \"speak bitterness\" campaign in the village, his problem was also raised. After hearing about this, Xu felt deeply uneasy. However, he had also received education for a long time, his awareness had increased, and he believed that as long as he confessed his mistakes, he would definitely be forgiven. Therefore, he voluntarily asked for leave to return to his village to resolve the issue. After discussing with the village cadres, he requested a meeting to confess. When the meeting was announced by the cadres, the atmosphere was silent, and the masses did not raise any opinions. Xu then handed over his weapon to the cadres and declared to the masses: In the past, because I was in the bandit troops, I did things that wronged the masses, but now I have joined the Eighth Route Army and have received education. The weapon I am carrying now is to protect the masses, and I hope everyone will not be afraid. Only then did the masses raise their opinions about him. Xu then thoroughly confessed one by one, admitting his mistakes and denouncing Liu Mingde's many crimes. Seeing that he confessed thoroughly, the village cadres stepped forward to mediate, explaining that after joining the Eighth Route Army, he had abandoned evil and returned to good, and was determined to serve the people wholeheartedly. The meeting immediately broke into discussions: The Eighth Route Army is good; it educates the bad guys into good people. The masses then shouted: \"Forgive him, forgive him!\" Cui Changjing (Cui Changgong's younger brother), the victim, jumped up and said: \"Xu 'Tiger,' it's nothing. You killed my brother, but I know you were forced by others. We are now one family; whatever is said is over.\" At this time, Xu \"Tiger,\" the cadres, and the masses were all moved to tears. Xu repeatedly saluted and apologized to Cui. Finally, a unanimous decision was made: Forgive Xu \"Tiger\" and let him work hard in the army in the future.

UNRRA personnel were not invited to participate in the \"discussion\" of the distribution of relief supplies. The Baojia chiefs submitted a list of those who should be \"relieved.\" On the first day of distributing relief supplies, many people wearing fine clothes and gold jewelry came and hired laborers to carry the flour. The first was a woman, particularly beautifully dressed, who said she had left Northern Jiangsu a year ago and had lived in Huaiyin. She is now married to a patrol officer and wants to collect relief grain for her family of seven. The second woman, wearing silk clothes and gold jewelry, is the mistress of a businessman in Zhenjiang.

Soong Ching-ling recently issued a statement pointing out that the path of establishing a coalition government, implementing a democratic system and land reform is the path to the liberation of the Chinese people, and it is also the path to implementing Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Soong Ching-ling compared the situation in the Communist areas with that in the Kuomintang areas, pointing out that the reason why there is no famine in the Communist areas is because the Communists have implemented the political program of Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, which was the foundation of the Kuomintang-Communist alliance. Therefore, foreign observers have praised the great achievements made by the CPC due to the implementation of this system. July 24th Reuters: The Manchester Guardian published an article pointing out many facts proving that credible administrative organs have been established in the CPC areas, which are much better than the organs established in the Kuomintang areas. July 26th Reuters reported: Anyone who has been to the CPC areas points out that these areas are the opposite of the Kuomintang areas. The Kuomintang's corruption and violence have reached such a point that the UNRRA recently stopped supplying materials because these materials were pocketed by senior Kuomintang officials. Chinese democrats have realized that the liberated areas are the basic base for implementing Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Therefore, they call the reactionaries' attack on these areas an attack on Sun Yat-sen's democracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努谈话：  国民党反动派进攻解放区是进攻孙中山的三民主义\n\n1946-08-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努谈话：\n    国民党反动派进攻解放区是进攻孙中山的三民主义\n    【新华社延安六日电】莫斯科五日广播评论员马西努时事谈话，指出国民党反动派向解放区进攻是消灭孙中山三民主义正义主张，使三民主义不能在中国全国内实行。宋庆龄不久前发表声明，指出成立联合政府实行民主制度与土地改革的道路，是中国人民解放的道路，也就是实行孙中山三民主义的道路。宋庆龄以共产党区域的情形与国民党区域相比较，指出共产党的区域没有饥荒现象的原因，由于共产党人实行了孙中山先生在世时的政纲，这曾是国共联盟的基础。因此外国观察家无不称道中共由于实行这种制度而达到的巨大成绩。七月二十四日路透社讯：曼彻斯特导报发表论文指出许多事实，证明在中共区域内已建立了有威信的行政机关，比起国民党区域内所建立的机关要好的多。七月二十六日路透社报导：凡到过中共各地区的人，都指出这些地区与国民党区域相反。而国民党腐败与强暴的手段已达到如此地步，以致联总于不久前停止供给物资。因为这些物资都被国民党大官装入私囊。中国民主人士已认识到解放区是实行孙中山三民主义的基本根据地。因此，他们把反动派向这些区域的进攻叫做反对孙中山民主主义的进攻。"

This is the general opinion of progressive public opinion circles here. Mr. Pi Qiang said: \"Many people, even some of the Kuomintang reactionaries, can see that the Kuomintang will collapse in the civil war, but the Communist Party will not, because the Kuomintang today is an almost completely rotten, top-down empty shell.\" Mr. Li Keming said: \"The Kuomintang itself already has too many problems. Is it possible to face such a profound crisis with such an unbearable institution and fight for a long time?\" Mr. Li Nanshan said: \"The troops are so bad, the famine is so serious, the economy is so panicked, and the people are so tired of war. Even if the warmongers are keen on war, if the other side is not weak and the people's hearts are with them, how can this civil war be fought?\" Ai Hansong said: \"As a result of the war, the people will be poor and their wealth exhausted, the people will have no means of livelihood, the people's grievances will boil, and the people's uprisings will arise. At that time, the whole country may be in chaos. Although the party suppressing the chaos has 'American equipment,' what can it do if its soldiers are unwilling to fight and the people are tired of war?\" The Democratic National Construction Association specifically pointed out that for the sake of the civil war, monthly military spending of more than 200 billion yuan cannot be reduced, but can only increase, and inflation will naturally fall into an uncontrollable situation. On the other hand, in addition to destroying a large amount of materials, military operations also shrink industrial and agricultural production and disrupt transportation. Under the double attack of daily inflation and daily elimination of materials, how can the economy not collapse? The collapse of the economy may also be the collapse of the entire political and military system at the same time. Moreover, the disaster has spread across the country, tens of millions of famine victims are waiting to be fed, and the tide of strikes and work slowdowns has spread to public school teachers. The situation can be said to be extremely serious. Can we still fight? Can we still delay because of the war? Therefore, the association believes that war is equal to delay, and delay is still a dead end. There is only one way out, which is to stop the war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海进步舆论指出：  内战继续打下去  国民党将总崩溃\n\n1946-08-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海进步舆论指出：\n    内战继续打下去\n    国民党将总崩溃\n    【新华社延安七日电】沪汛：内战打下去，将引起国民党的总崩溃，这是此间进步舆论界的一般意见。丕强氏称：“许多人就连国民党反动派中的一部分，都看得出国民党在内战中会自趋崩溃，共产党则不会，因为国民党今天是一个几乎将要完全腐烂的、自上而下的空架子。”李克明氏说：“国民党本身问题已经多得不能再多，以如此不堪的机构面临如此深刻的危机，长期打下去，将是可能的吗？”李南山氏说：“部队如此不行，饥荒这样严重，经济这样恐慌，民心这样厌战，好战分子纵使好战，如果对方并不弱，而且民心归之，这个内战如何打法？”艾寒松氏称：“战争结果，民穷财尽，民不聊生，民怨沸腾，民变蜂起，到那时候就可能弄得全国大乱。制乱的一方虽然拥有‘美式配备’，其奈士不用命，人民厌战何？”民主建国会更具体指出：为着内战，每月二千亿元以上的军费不但无法减少，而且只有增加，通货膨胀自然就更要陷于无法收拾的地步。另一面，军事行动除了大量毁灭物资以外，还使工农生产萎缩，交通停顿，在通货逐日膨胀和物资逐日消灭的面面夹攻之下，经济那得不崩溃？！经济的崩溃，可能同时就是整个政治军事的崩溃。且看灾荒已经遍满全国，数千万的饥民嗷嗷待哺，罢工怠工的风潮已经蔓延到公教人员，形势也可说是严重到极点了，还能战吗？还能因战而拖吗？因此该会认为战就等于拖，拖依然是死路，活路只有一条，就是停战。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Regarding the bombing of the CCP's Yan'an headquarters by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft on the 2nd, this reporter specifically visited Captain Liu Shanben and others who recently flew to Yan'an to withdraw from the civil war to inquire about their opinions. Captain Liu stated: \"This time, the government authorities sent aircraft to bomb the CCP headquarters in Yan'an, which indicates that they have no sincerity for peaceful negotiation. Yesterday, the Central News Agency's telegram stated: The Ministry of National Defense spokesman said that the bombers did not fly over Yan'an, attempting to drop bombs around Wangjiaping, the CCP's Yan'an headquarters, trying to deny this fact that everyone witnessed. This is a very ridiculous sophistry.\" He said: \"We oppose the government authorities using American aircraft for combat. Chinese Air Force friends should quickly take action to oppose the civil war and maintain the glory of the anti-Japanese patriotic war.\"\n\n　　Captain Zhang Shouyi was reading the Central News Agency's telegram when the reporter asked for his opinion. He said indignantly: \"The Central News Agency said that the bombing of Yan'an was only to destroy a 'liberation' style aircraft parked at the airport here. This is purely a cover-up. The 'B24' No. 530 aircraft parked at Yan'an Airport was flown from Chengdu to Yan'an by us on June 26th to withdraw from the civil war. The aircraft had already unloaded its bomb racks, bomb sights, bullets, and other armaments in Shanghai. When coming to Yan'an, the CCP also guaranteed that the aircraft would never be used in the civil war. Captain Liu Shanben also made this statement in his conversation on July 4th. We originally intended to properly keep the aircraft and return it to the Ministry of National Defense for use after the establishment of a joint government. But the government did not hesitate to strafe and burn it. Can this really 'prevent the CCP from using the aircraft to oppose the government'?\" Captain Zhang said: \"The Central News Agency attempts to deny the bombing of the CCP's Yan'an headquarters, but I personally witnessed the following facts that day: First, the bombs dropped by the government bombers all landed within 500 yards of the CCP headquarters, which is clearly that the bombing aiming point was the Yan'an headquarters, not the airport. At the same time, the 'B24' No. 530 aircraft parked at the airport is about two miles away from the Wangjiaping headquarters, and it is by no means due to a throwing error. Second, the aircraft parked at the airport was repeatedly strafed by 'P47' fighter planes, causing a fire, and black smoke rose into the air before the government bombers entered to drop bombs. Third, when the government bombers bombed Yan'an, the final bombing route was along the line from south to north along the Yan River, passing the CCP Party School and Wangjiaping, and did not pass over the airport. This is what I personally saw, and it is also what all the citizens of Yan'an saw, and the Central News Agency cannot cover it up or deny it.\"\n\n　　Air Force personnel Mr. Tang Shiyao said: \"The 'B24' aircraft of the Eighth Squadron was ordered in 1944 under the Lend-Lease Act. When these aircraft were handed over to the Chinese government by the United States, it was stated that they were not allowed to be used in the civil war. The Eighth Squadron still has U.S. Air Force personnel serving as advisors, but on the 2nd of this month, it came to bomb the CCP headquarters in Yan'an. This proves that the U.S. authorities have violated the initial agreement and are helping the Chinese government authorities to carry out the civil war.\" Mr. Tang solemnly pointed out: \"We demand that the U.S. government immediately freeze the aircraft leased to the Kuomintang under the Lend-Lease Act and stop the continued lending of military weapons until a joint government and joint command are established in China.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刘善本上尉等发表谈话  斥蒋机轰炸延安总部  号召空军朋友速用行动反对内战\n\n1946-08-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刘善本上尉等发表谈话\n    斥蒋机轰炸延安总部\n    号召空军朋友速用行动反对内战\n    【新华社延安七日电】为蒋机二日轰炸中共延安总部事，记者特走访日前驾机来延退出内战的刘善本上尉等叩询意见，刘上尉称：“此次政府当局派机轰炸中共首脑部延安，乃表示他们对于和平协商毫无诚意。昨日中央社电中称：国防部发言人说，轰炸机并未飞临延安上空想把炸弹掷于中共延安总部王家坪周围，把这件人人目击的事实一笔抹掉，这是一种非常可笑的诡辩。”他说：“我们反对政府当局利用美机作战，中国空军朋友应迅速用行动来反对内战，保持抗日爱国战争中的光荣”。\n    张受益上尉正阅完中央社的电讯，记者向其征求意见，他愤慨的说：“中央社说轰炸延安只是为了要毁去这儿机场上停留的一架解放式飞机，这纯粹是一种掩饰。停留在延安机场上的‘Ｂ２４’式五三○号飞机，是我们为退出内战于六月二十六日由成都飞来延安的。该机在上海即卸去机弹钩、轰炸瞄准具、子弹等武装；来延安，中共亦曾保证该机绝不用于内战，七月四日刘善本上尉谈话中，亦曾作此种声明。我们原拟将该机予以妥善保管，待联合政府成立后，仍供国防部使用。但政府竟不惜予以扫射焚毁，原来这就可做“阻止中共用该机以反对政府么？”张上尉说：“中央社企图否认轰炸中共延安总部，但当天我亲眼看到以下事实：第一、政府轰炸机所投炸弹，均落于中共总部周围不及五百码处，这显然是轰炸瞄准点为延安总部，并非机场。同时，机场上停留之‘Ｂ２４’五三○号机距王家坪总部约二英里，也绝非投掷偏差所致。第二、机场上停留之飞机遭‘Ｐ４７’驱逐机数次低飞扫射，已起火燃烧，黑烟腾空，政府轰炸机始进入投弹。第三、政府轰炸机轰炸延安时，最后进入轰炸航路，系沿延河两侧中共党校与王家坪自南至北一线，并未通过机场上空，这是我亲眼所见，也是延市全体市民所亲见，中央社是无法掩饰和抵赖的。”\n    空军人员唐世耀先生说：“第八大队的‘Ｂ２４’式机，系一九四四年以租借法案定购，这些飞机由美国交给中国政府时，曾声明不准用于内战。现在八大队尚留有美空军人员担任顾问，而本月二日竟来轰炸中共延安总部，这证明美国当局已违背了当初的约言，帮助中国政府当局进行内战。”唐先生郑重指出：“我们要求美政府立即冻结由租借法案中租给国民党的飞机，并停止军火武器的继续借给，直到中国成立联合政府与联合统帅部之后。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. TASS reports: The Paris Peace Conference's Procedural Committee held two meetings on the 5th, with fierce debate over the rules of voting on proposals. At the morning meeting, the British delegation proposed an amendment to the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Judging from the British representative's amendment, they are in favor of the majority vote rule. The speeches of representatives from Brazil, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and other countries showed an organized joint opposition to the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The Yugoslav representative, Kardelj, spoke criticizing the proposals opposing the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and the Polish representative also supported the passage of the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers in his speech. At the afternoon meeting, Molotov, the chief representative of the Soviet delegation, delivered a speech stating that the British representative's amendment was unacceptable because it would nullify the decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers, which the British representative had participated in and passed. Secondly, he pointed out that public opinion in various countries believes that the reason why representatives of certain countries are striving for the principle of simple majority voting and opposing the principle of passing resolutions by a two-thirds vote is that a certain group of countries wants to gain an advantage at the peace conference. Molotov particularly pointed out that the trick of playing with votes is not allowed. He declared: In such a situation, the nine countries most severely invaded and ravaged by the enemy countries (three Soviet Republics, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Abyssinia) may become a minority when the peace conference resolves issues closely related to them. Finally, Molotov insisted on the original decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers, that is, if a country's proposal is supported by a two-thirds vote, such a proposal can be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for review. However, he also proposed a supplementary method, that is, those opinions that have not been passed by a two-thirds vote can, but only in the name of the respective countries, make suggestions to the Council of Foreign Ministers themselves. It is reported that the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Poland, France, Norway, and other countries will decide to support a two-thirds majority. Other countries, including the United States and the representatives of the Kuomintang government who echoed the United States' views, will support the British proposal.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Paris dispatch: The Peace Conference's Procedural Committee continued to debate the issue of voting rules on the 6th. The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States had a dispute at the meeting. Molotov condemned the United States and Britain for contradicting themselves by not respecting the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers and proposing amendments. Molotov also cited the minutes of the Council of Foreign Ministers as evidence. Byrnes said: \"The Soviet Union is trying to monopolize the peace conference through the Four Powers.\" Molotov replied: \"The so-called Four Powers is an American idea.\" The debate remained inconclusive.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Moscow dispatch: The Soviet magazine \"New Times\" recently published an article discussing the Paris Peace Conference, stating that the Soviet people hope that the conference will be completely successful and express their trust in the conference's wise resolution of issues. The construction of the peace conference can only achieve the provisions for lasting peace in the world by respecting the sovereignty of all large and small democratic countries. The complete guarantee of international relations lies in recognizing cooperation based on equality. All depend on defeating all conspirators and agitators who attempt to stir up new conflicts and wars.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 和会议案表决规则分歧益甚  英美违背四外长决定  莫洛托夫演说严词拒斥\n\n1946-08-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　和会议案表决规则分歧益甚\n    英美违背四外长决定\n    莫洛托夫演说严词拒斥\n    【新华社延安七日电】塔斯社报道：巴黎和会程序委员会于五日举行两次会议，关于议案表决规则发生激烈争辩。上午会议上，英国代表团提出对外长委员会决议的修正案。从英国代表的修正案看来，他们是赞成过半数表决规则的。巴西、荷兰、新西兰等国代表的发言，有组织的共同反对外长委员会的决议。南斯拉夫代表卡德尔发言批评反对外长委员会决议的提议，波兰代表在发言中也赞成通过外长委员会的决议。午后会议上，苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫发表演说，声称英国代表的修正案是不能容纳的，因为它会取消由英国代表参加而通过的外长委员会的决议。其次，他指出各国社会舆论认为某几国代表争取简单多数的表决原则、反对以三分之二票通过决议的原则，是因为某几国集团想在和会上占优势。莫洛托夫特别指出，不容许玩弄票数的把戏，他宣称：在这样的情形下，受敌国侵犯与蹂躏最惨重的九个国家（三个苏维埃共和国、捷、法、波、南、希、阿比西尼亚）在和会解决它们切身有关的问题时，可能成为少数。最后莫洛托夫坚持外长委员会的原来决议，即某国的建议有三分之二投票赞成时，这种建议可以转交外长委员会，由外长委员会审查之。但他又提出一种补充办法，即那些未满三分之二票通过的意见，可以但只能以各该国的名义自行向外长委员会提出建议。据悉，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、南、波、法、挪等国将决定支持三分之二多数了。另外一些国家包括美国以及附和美国意见的国民党政府的代表在内，将支持英国的建议。\n    【新华社延安七日电】巴黎讯：和会程委会于六日继续辩论表决规则问题，苏美两国外长在会上发生争执，莫洛托夫谴责美英两国不尊守外长会议决议而提出修正案意见，前后矛盾。莫氏并引征外长会议的记录作证。贝纳斯则说：“苏联是经过四巨头来垄断和会”。莫氏回答说：“所谓四巨头是一种美国人的想法”。争辩仍无结果。\n    【新华社延安七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联《新时代》杂志顷撰文论述巴黎和会称：苏联人民对会议希望其完全成功，并对会议之贤明解决问题表示信赖。和会之建设，惟有尊重一切大小民主国家之主权，始能获致全世界永久和平之规定。国际完全之保障，乃在认识以平等为基础之合作。均有赖于战胜一切图谋掀起新冲突及战争之阴谋煽动分子。"

    "content": "Eyewitness Account of the Bombing of Yan'an\n　　By Ms. Anna Louise Strong\n　　Editor's Note: Ms. Strong is a well-known columnist for various American newspapers and the author of several reportage works. Among them, \"One-Fifth of Mankind,\" a book about the Chinese War of Resistance, has been particularly well-received. This time, she arrived in Shanghai in mid-July as a reporter for the Associated Press and eight newspapers, and flew to Yan'an from Ping on August 1st for an interview. This article was written specifically for the Associated Press. The author states that any Associated Press reporter can broadcast this article, and any Associated Press newspaper can reprint it.\n　　At approximately 11:30 AM on August 2nd, the thunderous sound of explosions led us outside. The translator came to urge us to immediately run into the air-raid shelter. Hurrying over under the blazing sun, he repeatedly apologized for the late warning, as no one had anticipated an air raid. In the clear sunlight, I saw an airplane flying towards me in a seemingly annoying manner, at an altitude of about 2,000 meters. The Yan River divides Yan'an into two parts, and I was on the west bank of the river at the time. The plane turned to fly towards the eastern part of Yan'an, which is where the military headquarters and the residences of important officials are located. Near me, riflemen in the knee-deep grass were aiming with their rifles, but the plane was too high to reach. Soon, we reached the air-raid shelter, a sturdy sandstone shelter with a movable wooden door. Yan'an has many excellent air-raid shelters because it was often bombed by Japanese aircraft in the past. In fact, the city was almost completely destroyed! Most people live in cave dwellings on the mountains on both sides of the small river. Our shelter was crowded with people, including women and infants, but there was no panic. I spent most of the time standing outside the cave watching. The bombs exploded about a mile away on the east bank of the river, in the area of the military headquarters and the airfield. Finally, thick black smoke rose! Later, the all-clear signal sounded, and people went home to eat.\n　　Investigations conducted jointly with U.S. military observers, along with Chinese testimonies, indicate that eight fighter planes first flew over Yan'an, using machine guns and incendiary bombs to concentrate fire on a \"B-24\" aircraft parked on the ground. This aircraft had flown from Chengdu to Yan'an on June 26th in a magnificent event and had been parked about a mile from the city. The fighter planes flew very low because Yan'an has no anti-aircraft guns. The \"B-24\" aircraft was completely destroyed by the accurate impact of the incendiary bombs.\n　　Later, another bomber followed, dropping eleven bombs, estimated to be approximately 500-pound bombs based on the size of the craters. Nine of them landed in a straight line between the military headquarters and the airfield, but closer to the military headquarters. The other two landed on the mountainside. The forty farmers who were mowing grass there scattered, and no one was hit. The bomber flew southwest, presumably returning to Xi'an, which has been the source of harassment for Yan'an for ten years. Local Chinese believe the bomber's target was to bomb the military headquarters and the forty farmers because the \"B-24\" aircraft had already been destroyed. In any case, the bombing was extremely inaccurate and hit nothing but the foothills, which is not surprising because most of Yan'an is foothills and cave dwellings, making it difficult to hit anything. Except for the \"B-24\" aircraft, which is now scrap metal, nothing was damaged. This aircraft had dramatically flown from Chengdu to Yan'an six weeks earlier. The guards at Yan'an airfield, thinking it was an enemy plane, aimed their rifles at it. The door of the plane opened, and the pilot, Liu Shanben, came out, raised his hand in salute, and shouted, \"Down with the Civil War!\" When Liu explained that he did not want to fight the Communists either, only hoped for a united China, and was willing to preserve the plane for the future joint government's Ministry of National Defense, everyone cheered. The Yan'an Communists agreed with Captain Liu's desire not to use the plane for civil war. Moreover, due to the central government's long-term blockade, there was a severe shortage of gasoline, parts, and equipment, making it difficult to use the plane anyway. The idea that the Communists had an air force was simply a joke. For six weeks, Captain Liu and his \"B-24\" were the \"Yan'an Air Force.\" The crude airfield here was only set up for American planes to connect with the U.S. military observer group every ten days. Some Communists proposed dismantling the plane's equipment because metal was extremely scarce here due to the central government's long-term blockade, and the parts and hardware from the plane were urgently needed. However, most opposed this suggestion for emotional reasons, because the plane was very new, valuable, and would one day be returned to China's joint government in a graceful manner, along with Captain Liu. So it was decided to exhibit the plane so that the people of the border region, who had often been bombed by Japanese aircraft but had never seen a bomber up close, could see what it actually looked like. The exhibition was originally scheduled to take place next week during the agricultural off-season, but it is now impossible to hold it. The \"B-24\" will now have to be used as scrap metal for Yan'an's factories.\n　　Yan'an people view this bombing as a formal declaration of civil war. They also said, \"Look at how an American plane destroyed another American plane!\" They find it very ridiculous. When we came out of the air-raid shelter and went down the mountain, I saw the Chinese flag—what was once considered the Kuomintang flag, the Blue Sky with a White Sun—flying high on the flagpole. The same flag is flying over Nanjing. I pointed to the flag and raised what I thought was a very doubtful question: \"Are you still hanging Chiang Kai-shek's portrait together with those of Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill, as you did during the War of Resistance?\" \"Of course,\" the unexpected answer was: \"We have never declared that we want to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek.\" This was a clear answer about fifteen minutes after the bombing.

    "content": "Chairman Yang of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Discusses Peaceful Construction in the Border Region Over the Past Year\n\nThe anniversary of the Japanese surrender is approaching. The reporter interviewed Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government about the peaceful construction of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region in the past year. Chairman Yang responded as follows:\n\nOn August 8th of last year, we launched a counteroffensive in coordination with the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan. During this period, due to the Red Army's invincibility and the active operations of our Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and South China Column and other anti-Japanese forces, the Japanese fascists were forced to announce their unconditional surrender on the 10th. Thereupon, the people of the entire border region immediately took action, cooperating with their sons and brothers in the Eighth Route Army to launch a larger-scale counteroffensive. Able-bodied men directly participated in carrying the wounded, transporting ammunition, and transporting military grain, while the elderly, women, and children maintained law and order in the rear and completed various production and construction tasks. Therefore, we were able to quickly complete the counteroffensive, connecting the four regions of Taihang, Taiyue, Jinnan, and Ji-Lu-Yu into one, increasing the original eighty-two county towns to one hundred and fourteen, with a total of one hundred and seventy-five counties including those without county towns but with county-level political power.\n\nSimultaneous with the start of the counteroffensive, peaceful construction began throughout the border region. Since the ceasefire order came into effect on January 13th, the border region has further carried out peaceful construction with all its strength in a planned and step-by-step manner.\n\nFirst, on democratic reform, we continued the work during the War of Resistance. After the people's emancipation movement, over 90% of the village administrations in the old liberated areas had undergone general elections, and the village administrations in the newly liberated areas had also been largely transformed. After eight years of training and transformation during the War of Resistance, the democratic political power in the border region, from villages to districts to counties, has become very sound and powerful. After a year of peaceful construction, the political power at all levels has become more sound and stronger.\n\nIn this year, the people of the entire border region have conducted universal representative elections for National Assembly representatives. Farmers, workers, merchants, students, soldiers, and women have all elected their own representatives to participate in the election, electing a total of fifty National Assembly representatives. If the Kuomintang completely implements the Three Major Agreements without modification, we are prepared to participate in the National Assembly.\n\nIn order to thoroughly implement the Three Major Agreements, our border region convened the largest-scale参议会 (Consultative Assembly) in March, with over 470参议员 (Consultative Assembly members) attending. These参议员 (Consultative Assembly members) had all undergone general elections before the meeting. At this参议会 (Consultative Assembly), peaceful construction plans for the entire border region, including 整军复员 (military reorganization and demobilization), finance, economy, education, and mobilizing the people to consolidate peace, were passed. After the meeting, they were gradually implemented. The 整军复员 (military reorganization and demobilization) has reached 70,500 people.\n\nThe support of the people's self-initiated emancipation movement has made the greatest progress since peaceful construction. Almost two-thirds of the cadres of political organs participated in supporting the people's 反奸清算 (anti-traitor liquidation) and rent and interest reduction work. In the old liberated areas, over 90% of the rent reduction work has been completed, and 60% to 70% of this work has been carried out in the newly liberated areas. On average, farmers throughout the border region have received almost two to three acres of land, and in most areas of our border region, the elimination of extreme poverty has been achieved, gradually realizing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of \"land to the tillers.\"\n\nAnother important task in peaceful construction is disaster relief. Aside from the Yellow River diversion relief, which is national in scope, relief for the disaster caused by the enemy and puppets in Mafang, Qin County, water disasters in Daming and other places, and relief funds for recovered towns and mines have amounted to 9 million catties of millet and 50,000,000冀钞 (Ji banknotes) to date. In order to solve the diseases of the people in the entire border region, the Border Government has established five large-scale peace hospitals in Xingtai, Linqing, Puyang, Changzhi, and Handan to carry out extensive medical work.\n\nHowever, because our border region has suffered severely from the devastation of the enemy and puppets for eight years, the loss of manpower, material resources, and financial resources is extremely heavy (our Border Region Government Relief Association has reported detailed statistical materials on various specific losses to the Executive Headquarters), and relief is urgently needed at present. However, we have received very few relief materials from the Executive Headquarters in the past. A batch sent by the Executive Headquarters from Taiyuan was not only seized by Yan Xishan's troops under the command of puppet army Duan Bingchang in Qin County, but also resulted in the killing of many old people in Qin County and the arrest of more than 600 people. Recently, Jiang Tingfu of the Executive Headquarters even said, \"The liberated areas do not need grain relief,\" which is completely unreasonable denial. We want to make a solemn appeal to the whole country and the world.\n\nSecondly, on production and construction: (1) Agricultural production: Although after the counteroffensive began last year, we were faced with serious difficulties created by the enemy and puppets, our entire border region still carried out the vigorous wheat planting movement and various productions in a more orderly and planned manner than in any previous year. According to the investigation, the autumn wheat planting last year in Ji-Lu-Yu and Jinnan generally accounted for 70% to 80% of the total land. Some reached 90%. Because of the cold weather in Taihang and Taiyue, many areas also planted 70%, and generally planted 30% to 50%.\n\nOver the past year, 70% to 90% of the total labor force in the old liberated areas of the border region have participated in mutual aid groups and cooperatives. In the newly liberated areas where the people's emancipation movement has been more thorough, such as Changzhi, Changzi, and Jincheng, the participation rate in mutual aid groups and cooperatives has also reached 50% to 70%.\n\nIn this year's agricultural production, the entire border region has made efforts to 多耕多锄 (plow and hoe more), 精耕细作 (cultivate intensively). In some areas of Taihang and Taiyue, 耕三余一 (plowing three times and leaving one) has been achieved. Taking the meticulous cotton planting as an example, the Taihang region, which was not accustomed to planting cotton in the past, planned to plant one million mu this spring, but planted 1.5 million mu. This year, the entire Taiyue region also planted over 700,000 mu of cotton. Ji-Lu-Yu, especially Jinnan, has an even larger number. According to preliminary statistics, the cotton planting area in the entire border region has reached over 8 million mu.\n\n(2) Industry and Mining: After the end of the War of Resistance, due to the puppet and stubborn elements inheriting the enemy's blockade policy and continuing to implement a blockade against our border region, the Border Government led the people to be self-sufficient and further developed self-reliant handicrafts in the entire border region. Woolen textiles, cloth, papermaking, oil pressing, etc., have not only reached self-sufficiency, but also have some exports. According to the investigation, only 土布 (homespun cloth) has 50 million catties for export each year, and there is also a large amount of oil for export. Other industries such as leather, flour, and matches are also gradually recovering.\n\nAll the large mines and factories before the War of Resistance were fully restored shortly after the counteroffensive. Small coal mines, iron industries, and porcelain industries have also largely resumed operation.\n\nBecause of inconvenient transportation, small factories and mines have developed very commonly in various places. Moreover, small factories and mines make the most money.\n\nDue to the development of industry and mining and the prosperity of commerce, two large-scale transportation companies have been formed.\n\nThe lives of workers have also been improved. The highest wage is equivalent to 400 catties of millet per month, and the lowest is 200 catties per month, which is a great improvement compared to the life before the War of Resistance.\n\n(3) Commerce: Since the beginning of the counteroffensive and the recovery of towns, we have proposed \"developing the economy and prospering the market\" according to the inland trade freedom policy. Therefore, every town has prospered immediately after being recovered. Over the past year, every market in the border region has been greatly developed. Taking Handan City as an example, according to the recent talk of the 商联筹委会 (Commercial Federation Preparatory Committee): the number of seated merchants and stall vendors in the city has increased to 2,500 to 2,600 (of which small stall vendors account for slightly less than half). The import and export tax rates are also not high. In the past six months, although market prices have fluctuated twice due to misjudgment of peace and poor management of import and export goods, the prices in various markets have fallen back and gradually stabilized after emergency measures.\n\n(4) Transportation Construction: In order to facilitate the exchange of goods and economic information in various places, the border region started to restore transportation since the beginning of the counteroffensive. Over the past year, not only have the roads within the entire border region been restored, but the roads leading to neighboring areas such as Linyi, Kaifeng, Anyang, and Shijiazhuang have also been repaired. In order to rationally manage these roads, a Highway Administration Bureau has been established. We have also started planning railways. Since the end of February, we have established a Railway Administration Bureau to carry out restoration preparations. Not only have various railway projects been surveyed and measured long ago, and several sections of the roadbed have been completed, but because the Kuomintang has no sincerity in restoring transportation and wants to use it as a means to attack the border region, the railway has not been fully completed so far.\n\nAnother important task in transportation construction is the universal adjustment and expansion of post offices and postal routes. Over the past year, the postal routes in the entire border region have become more rationalized, and the delivery time has been greatly shortened. Recently, the border region has also negotiated with the Kuomintang authorities through Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party of China, to prepare to open up with the national postal service.\n\n(5) Water Conservancy Construction: Ji-Lu-Yu launched a large-scale Yellow River management project on an unprecedented scale, with 230,000 civilian laborers regularly engaged in levee restoration work along the 400-mile-long Yellow River. We are preparing to complete the Yellow River management project that has not been completed for decades. In Jinnan, the river management project this year has also achieved significant results.\n\nIn order to ensure this year's production and construction, 150 million yuan of production loans have been announced from January to July in the first half of the year, and 50 million yuan has been issued but not announced, totaling 200 million yuan.\n\nThird, education construction can be divided into social education and school cadre education.\n\nIn school cadre education, the border region has established Northern University in the past year, with Mr. Fan Wenlan, a famous professor and scholar from Beiping before the War of Resistance, as the president. There are now more than 1,500 staff and students. The number of secondary schools in the entire border region has increased from more than 20 during the War of Resistance to 47. The number of students has also more than doubled.\n\nDuring the War of Resistance, there were more than 60 高小校 (higher primary schools) with 8,760 students in Taihang, and now there are 134 with the number of students increasing to 13,400; during the War of Resistance, there were 129 in Jinnan with more than 20,000 students, and now there are 164 with 32,800 students; during the War of Resistance, there were 82 in Ji-Lu-Yu with 26,000 students, and now there are 160 with 39,000 students; during the War of Resistance, there were 80 in Taiyue, and now there are 138 with 13,277 students.\n\nThe number of 初小校 (junior primary schools) in the entire border region: there were 4,680 in Taihang before the counteroffensive, and now there are 6,201; the number of students is only a partial statistic of 122,579; there were 4,185 in Jinnan before the counteroffensive, and now there are 9,099 with 6,100,000 students; there were 5,887 in Ji-Lu-Yu before the counteroffensive, and now there are 23,000 with 1,250,000 students; there were 300 in Taiyue before the counteroffensive, and now there are 5,120 with 230,000 students.\n\nAmong them, there are 15,000 public-funded students in the universities, middle schools, 高小校 (higher primary schools), and 初小校 (junior primary schools).\n\nIn many counties in the border region, the number of enrolled children accounts for more than 80% of school-age children. According to the survey in Zuoquan: there are 11,993 school-age children, and 10,111 children are enrolled. The national education in the entire border region is moving in the direction of 民办公助 (people-run schools with government assistance). Taihang has increased from one-third before the counteroffensive to the current one-half.\n\nWhether in universities, middle schools, 高小校 (higher primary schools), or 初小校 (junior primary schools), the new democratic education is implemented to inspire students' free thinking. From educational practice, it has been explored that running schools must be combined with practice and serve the people and production. Therefore, schools throughout the border region call on students to participate in practical work whenever there is an opportunity. For example, during the production season, they take production leave to help the people produce, and participate in helping the masses in the people's rent and interest reduction movement. From this learning combined with practice, they cultivate talents who serve the people.\n\nSocial education: On average, every administrative village in the entire border region has one to one and a half people's schools, and some administrative villages have two or three. According to statistics from 40 counties in Taihang, there are 15,000 people's schools with 1,050,000 male and female students. Almost all the masses of men and women in the entire border region have generally entered schools. In the people's schools, three kinds of education are carried out: current affairs, production, and literacy. After studying in the people's schools, the people's political and cultural level has been greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for production has also been developed. Any ordinary people can correctly discuss current affairs issues, and the people's thinking has been completely liberated. And some areas have achieved the elimination of illiteracy.\n\nIn addition to this, in social education, every village in the entire border region has a public blackboard, and many towns have public education centers and public broadcasting stations. Every town and many villages also have rural theater troupes; according to statistics from ten counties in Taihang, there are 998 rural theater troupes. No matter which village you walk into, you will feel an atmosphere of peace, tension, and joy.\n\nFourth, financial construction: First, after the realization of peace, we started to reduce the people's burden by 350 million yuan and implemented the method of calculating the price of supporting labor, which greatly reduced the people's labor force.\n\nOn rural burdens, a unified progressive tax and fair burden are implemented, and an industrial and commercial business tax is implemented in cities. Necessary industries are rewarded with tax exemption or reduction, and industry is reduced by one-quarter to one-third compared to commerce. More than 120 kinds of extortionate taxes and levies before the War of Resistance and during the enemy's rule have been completely abolished.\n\nAt the same time, the military, government, and civilian personnel of the entire border region have practiced frugality and used their own hands to produce themselves to make up for the shortage of funds and living expenses for organs and troops.\n\nThe entire border region has implemented free remittance, and people can freely remit their money.\n\nIn short, in the entire financial and economic construction, we not only focus on developing new sources of income, but also pay attention to节流 (reducing expenditure) in order to quickly restore the people's vitality.\n\nFifth, judicial work: In this year, the entire border region summarized and improved the experience of judicial work in the past eight years of the War of Resistance. For civil cases, the emphasis is on mediation. In this year, 80% of civil cases were resolved through mediation.\n\nFor criminal cases, the policy of education is adopted, and the perpetrators are required to focus on confession and self-reflection.\n\nIn litigation procedures, oral statements are mostly adopted to reduce troublesome procedures such as writing petitions.\n\nSince ancient times, the laws of reactionary forces have been shackles to suppress the common people. And today, the laws of the democratic government are powerful weapons for the common people to suppress reactionary forces, maintain social order, and protect the people's production. Therefore, the current social order in the border region has reached an extraordinarily good state.\n\nThe above is only an overview of the peaceful construction in the border region in the past year. Many more specific and rich materials are still to be investigated and statistically analyzed. In a word, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region has been carrying out universal peaceful construction at all times since the Japanese surrender. After this year's efforts, the strength of the people in the border region has been many times greater than when they defeated the Japanese invaders. More than 30 million people in the entire border region have deeply realized their responsibility to defend peace, making the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region a strong fortress for defending the cause of independent, peaceful, and democratic construction. It is simply impossible for the reactionaries to divide us like the Japanese invaders.\n\nFrom this year's peaceful construction, a general experience of the past few years has been further proved, that is, first of all, a united three-thirds democratic government should be established from top to bottom to lead the people, so that politics can serve the people at all times and in all matters, and first of all, politically, the people should be thoroughly liberated, allowing the people to fully enjoy their freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and residence, and carrying out 反奸清算 (anti-traitor liquidation) and thoroughly implementing rent and interest reduction, so that the traitors can be eliminated and the feudal reactionary rule can be overthrown, and then the improvement of the people's lives can be achieved satisfactorily.\n\nIn the current situation, the direction of future efforts should be to mobilize all forces to defend peace, defend the border region, repel the attacks of the Kuomintang fascist reactionaries, and implement the 反奸清算 (anti-traitor liquidation) and rent and interest reduction policies, thoroughly mobilize the masses, and then launch a large-scale production movement. Around this central task, the various peaceful constructions in the border region should be carried out even better. (Rong Yinong)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府杨主席谈  边区一年来的和平建设\n荣一农\n1946-08-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府杨主席谈\n    边区一年来的和平建设\n    日寇投降周年已届，记者以晋冀鲁豫边区一年来和平建设的情形，叩访边府杨主席。承杨主席答复如下：\n    去年八月八日，我们配合着苏联对日寇的宣战，开始了反攻。这期间，由于红军之不可敌御，以及我八路军、新四军、华南纵队等抗日部队的积极行动，迫使日本法西斯在十日宣布了无条件投降。于此，全边区人民立刻行动起来，配合子弟兵八路军进入更大规模的反攻。壮年人直接参加抬伤兵、运子弹、运军粮，老年和妇女儿童在后方维持治安，并完成各种生产建设任务。因此，我们能很快的完成反攻，使太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫四个地区连成一片，使原来八十二座县城，增加到一百一十四座，连没有县城而有县政权的共达一百七十五县。\n    与反攻开始同时，全边区就开始了和平建设。自停战命令于一月十三日生效后，边区更以全力有计划有步骤的进一步和平建设。\n    首先在民主改革上，继续抗战中的工作。经过人民翻身运动，在老解放区的村政权已有百分之九十以上经过了普选，新解放区的村政权，也都大部经过改造。县政权经过普选的已有二十四县。边区的民主政权经过抗战八年的锻炼改造，自村而区而县已经很健全而有力了，经过一年来的和平建设，各级政权益加健全和坚强了。\n    在这一年中，全边区人民已进行了普遍的代议性的国大代表选举，农、工、商、学、兵及妇女都推选了自己的代表参加选举，一共选出国大代表五十人。如果国民党毫无修改的彻底执行三大协议，我们是准备参加国民大会的。\n    我们边区为了彻底执行三大协议，于三月间，召开了最大规模的一次参议会，到会参议员四百七十余人。这些参议员，在会前都经过了普选。在这次参议会上，通过了全边区的整军复员、财政、经济、教育、发动人民巩固和平等和平建设计划。会后均逐步付诸实施。整军复员已达七万零五百人。\n    扶植人民自下而上的翻身运动，和平建设以来进步最大。政权机关几乎以三分之二的干部参加了扶持人民反奸清算、减租减息工作。在老解放区已有百分之九十以上完成了减租工作，新解放区也有百分之六十到七十进行了这一工作。全边区的农民平均差不多得到二三亩土地，在我们边区大部地区已经作到消灭赤贫，逐渐实现孙中山先生“耕者有其田”的主张。\n    在和平建设中，另一个重要工作——就是救济灾荒。黄河改道救济因带有全国性的除外，仅救济沁县马坊等地敌伪灾，大名等地的水灾及收复各城镇矿山等救济费，截至目前统计，已用小米九百万斤，冀钞五万万元。为了解决全边区人民的疾病，边府在邢台、临清、濮阳、长治、邯郸等地设立了五个大规模的和平医院，开展广泛的医疗工作。\n    但是由于我们边区八年来受敌伪的摧残，人力、物力、财力损失奇重（我们边区政府救济分会已将各种具体损失统计材料报告行总），目前急需救济。可是我们过去接到行总的救济物资很少。行总从太原发来的一批，不仅为阎锡山部指使伪军段炳昌部在沁县扣去，而且因此事杀死沁县武乡很多老百姓，并捕去六百多人。近来行总蒋廷黻竟说：“解放区不需要粮食救济”，这完全是无理的抵赖。我们要向全国与全世界提出郑重声诉。\n    其次在生产建设上：（一）农业生产：去年反攻开始后虽然在敌伪造成的严重困难下，我们全边区仍然是较过去任何一年更有秩序有计划的进行了蓬蓬勃勃的种麦运动和各种生产。据调查去年秋季种麦，冀鲁豫、冀南一般占全土地的百分之七十到八十。有的达到百分之九十。太行太岳因为天气寒冷，很多地区也种到百分之七十，一般都种到百分之三十到五十。\n    一年来，边区老解放区参加互助组与合作社的占全劳力的百分之七十到九十。而新解放区人民翻身运动较彻底的地区，如长治、长子、晋城等地，参加互助组合作社的亦达百分之五十到七十。\n    在这一年的农业生产中，全边区都作到多耕多锄，精耕细作。在太行、太岳某些地区已作到耕三余一。就以耕作细致的种棉来说，过去种棉不习惯的太行全区，今春计划种一百万亩，结果种到一百五十万亩。太岳全区今年也种棉七十余万亩。冀鲁豫特别是冀南为数更大。据初步材料统计，全边区种棉业达八百余万亩。\n    （二）工矿业：抗战结束后，由于伪顽承继了敌寇的封锁政策，继续对我边区实行封锁，边府领导人民自给自足，在全边区进一步普遍的展开了自力更生的手工业。毛织品、布匹、造纸、榨油等，不仅达到了可以自给自足，而且还有一部分可以出口。据调查仅土布每年有五千万斤可以出口，油类也有很大数量出口，其他皮革、面粉、火柴诸业亦逐渐恢复。\n    抗战前的大矿厂均于反攻后不久全部恢复。小煤窑、铁业、磁业等均大部复业。\n    因为交通不方便，所以各地小型工厂、矿厂发展的很普遍。而且也以小型工厂、矿厂赚钱最多。\n    由于工业、矿业的发展，商业的繁荣，已有两个大规模的运输公司组成。\n    工人生活也得到改善，工资最高者每月合小米四百斤，最低者每月也有二百斤，较抗战前的生活是大大的改善了。\n    （三）商业：自反攻开始，城镇收复，我们根据内地贸易自由政策，提出“发展经济，繁荣市场”，所以各个城镇一收复，马上就繁荣起来。一年来，边区每一个市场都得到很大的发展，就以邯郸市来说，据商联筹委会最近谈：现在全市坐商与摊贩已增加到二千五六百座（其中小摊贩占二分之一弱）。出入口税率也不高。近半年来，虽然由于对和平估计有错，对出入口货管理较差，市场物价有两度波动，但近经紧急措施，各市场物价均已回落，逐渐走向平稳。\n    （四）交通建设：为了便利各地商品的交流和经济情报的交换，边区自反攻开始，就着手恢复交通。一年来不仅全边区内的公路都已恢复，且已把通邻区临沂、开封、安阳、石家庄等公路均已修复。为了合理管理这些公路，并成立了公路管理局。铁路我们也着手筹划，自二月底起，我们就成立了铁路管理局，进行修复筹备工作。不仅铁路上各种工程早已勘察测量完竣，路基已有几段修成，只因国民党对修复交通毫无诚意，且欲以为进攻边区之手段，致使铁路迄今没有全部修成。\n    在交通建设上另一个重要工作就是邮政局、邮路的普遍调整扩充。一年来全边区邮路更加合理化，邮递时间大大缩短。最近边区又通过中共代表周恩来将军与国民党当局交涉，准备与全国邮政打通。\n    （五）水利建设：冀鲁豫以空前巨大的规模展开了治黄河工程，经常有二十三万民力，在四百多里长的黄河沿岸从事复堤工作。准备完成数十年来没有完成的治黄工程。而在冀南这一年的治河工程亦有显著成绩。\n    为了保证今年的生产建设，上半年一月到七月发放生产贷款已宣布的有十五万万元，已发放尚未宣布的五万万元，共计二十万万元。\n    第三、教育建设，可分社会教育和学校干部教育两方面。\n    在学校干部教育上，一年来，边区创立了北方大学，由抗战前北平名教授、学者范文澜先生任校长，现在职员学生已达一千五百余人。中学教育全边区由抗战中已有的二十几处增加到四十七处。学生亦较前增加一倍以上。\n    高小学校在抗战期间太行是六○余处，学生八七六○人，现在是一三四处，学生增加到一三、四○○人；冀南抗战期间一二九处，学生二○、○○○余人，现在一六四处，学生三二、八○○人；冀鲁豫抗战期间八二处，学生二六、○○○人，现在是一六○处，学生三九、○○○人；太岳抗战期间八十处，现有一三八处，现有学生已达一三、二七七人。\n    全边区的初小校：太行在反攻前是四六八○处，现在是六、二○一处；学生仅一小部分统计是一二二、五七九人；冀南反攻前四、一八五处，现在九、○九九处，学生六一○、○○○万；冀鲁豫反攻前五、八八七处，现在是二三、○○○处，学生一、二五○、○○○人；太岳初小反攻前三○○处，现有五、一二○处，学生已达二三○、○○○人。\n    其中干属在大学、中学、高小校、初小校的公费生有一五、○○○人。\n    在边区内，很多县份入学儿童占到学龄儿童的百分之八十以上，如左权的调查：学龄儿童一一、九九三人，入学儿童即达一○、一一一人。全边区的国民教育正走向民办公助的方向，太行已由反攻前的三分之一，达到现在的二分之一。\n    不论在大学、中学、高小、初小，都施行的是新民主主义的教育，启发学生的自由思想。从教育实践中摸索到办学校必须与实际结合，为人民为生产服务。因此全边区的学校，一有机会，就叫学生参加实际工作。例如在生产季节，放生产假帮助人民生产，在人民减租减息运动中，参加帮助群众翻身工作。从这种与实际结合的学习中，培养为人民服务的人材。\n    社会教育方面：全边区平均每一个行政村都有一个到一个半民众学校，有的行政村有两三个。据太行四十个县的统计，共有民众学校一五、○○○处，男女学生一百零五万人。全边区男女群众几乎都已普遍入校。在民众学校里进行时事、生产、识字三种教育。人民经过在民众学校里学习，政治文化水准大大提高后，生产情绪也发扬起来。任何一个老百姓都可以正确谈论时事问题，人民的思想已获得彻底解放。并有部分地区，已作到消灭文盲。\n    除此而外，在社会教育上，全边区村村有大众黑板，很多城镇都有民教馆、大众广播台。每个城镇和很多乡村还有农村剧团；据太行十个县的统计就有农村剧团九九八个。不管走进那个乡村，你都会感到一种和平、紧张、愉快的空气。\n    第四、财政建设：首先在和平实现后，着手减轻人民负担三十五万万元，实行了支差计价办法，减轻了民力很多。\n    在农村负担上，实行统一累进税与公平负担，在城市又实行了工商营业税。奖励必需的工业免税或减税，工业比商业减轻四分之一到三分之一。彻底废除了抗战前与敌寇统治时期的苛捐杂税一百二十多种。\n    同时，全边区的军政民学工作人员实行了节衣缩食，从亲自动手自己生产，来弥补机关部队经费及生活费用之不足。\n    全边区已实行自由通汇，人民可以自由汇兑自己的金钱。\n    总之我们在整个财政经济建设上，不仅要着手开源，而且还注意节流，以迅速恢复人民的元气。\n    第五、司法工作：在这一年间，全边区总结和提高了过去抗战八年中司法工作的经验，对民事案件，着重于调解。这一年中，百分之八十的民事案件，是以调解方式解决的。\n    对刑事案件，则采取以教育为主，令犯罪者着重坦白自省。\n    在诉讼手续上，多采取口诉方式，减少写状子等麻烦手续。\n    自古以来，反动势力的法律都是压制老百姓的锁镣。而今天民主政府的法律则是老百姓用以镇压反动势力，维持社会治安，保护人民生产的有力武器。因之目前边区的社会秩序已达到异常良好的境地。\n    以上这只是边区一年来和平建设的一个概况。许多更具体丰富的材料，尚待调查统计。总之一句话，晋冀鲁豫边区自日本投降以来，时时刻刻都在进行着普遍的和平建设。经过这一年的努力，边区人民的力量已较战胜日寇时，壮大了许多倍。全边区三千多万人民已深刻认识到自己保卫和平的责任，使晋冀鲁豫边区成了保卫独立和平民主建设事业的一个坚强堡垒，反动派要再像日寇一样的来分割我们，简直是不可能的。\n    从这一年的和平建设中，更证明了几年来一个总的经验，这就是自上而下的首先成立一个联合的三三制的民主政府，领导人民，使政治时时刻刻、随事随地为人民服务，首先政治上使人民彻底解放，叫人民充分享受自己的言论、出版、集会、居住等自由，展开反奸清算，彻底实行减租减息，才能把汉奸肃清，把封建反动统治推翻，然后始能达到圆满的改善人民生活。\n    在目前形势下，今后努力的方向，应该是动员一切力量保卫和平，保卫边区，打退国民党法西斯反动派的进攻，并贯彻反奸清算减租减息政策，彻底发动群众，进而展开大生产运动。围绕着这一中心任务，把边区各种和平建设开展的更好。（荣一农）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th: Shanghai report: \"Soviet New Life,\" a Russian-language newspaper run by Soviet citizens in this city, published an editorial on July 25th entitled \"Not What, But How,\" commenting on the U.S. State Department's reaction to Madame Sun Yat-sen's recent statement on the current situation. The editorial stated: The U.S. State Department used the formula of U.S. policy toward China to oppose Madame Sun's opinion, saying, \"Our policy toward China, as we have always said, is to seek China's unity.\" However, the issue is not about flaunting abstract principles and good intentions, but about seeking the best paths and methods to realize good principles and good intentions. Naturally, no one has ever hoped or does hope that the U.S. State Department would issue a statement saying that the U.S. wants to divide China, to make the conflicting parties more contentious, and to incite a greater civil war. First, in any case, the American people do not and will not have such intentions; second, even if some ruling figures in the U.S. have such a desire, they would never openly and shamelessly express this meaning in our era of striving for democracy and opposing fascism. However, the State Department's repetition of this bare, abstract formula in response to Madame Sun's statement, which earnestly requests the concrete realization of America's good intentions, is even more perplexing. The editorial continued: The natural response of the United States to Madame Sun's statement should be to re-examine the actual U.S. policy toward China. This policy has been in place for almost a year, and it has neither established a democratic government in China, nor been able to reconcile the hostile parties, nor has it weakened the danger of a long-term, bloody civil war. Chinese newspapers often point out in alarm the decline of American prestige in China. This decline in prestige is due to Marshall's failure to complete and resolve his mission, because the U.S. military is not withdrawing from China, and the U.S. only provides unilateral assistance. U.S. State Department officials should really pay more attention to the opinions expressed by Madame Sun, because, as the United Press said, they at least reflect the opinions of ninety-nine percent of the Chinese people. It is not possible to unilaterally announce good-sounding intentions without changing concrete political actions, actions that have caused the Chinese people to suffer for many months and have lowered American prestige.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪苏联新生活报著文  批评美固执助蒋政策  美国务院应更多的注意孙夫人声明\n\n1946-08-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪苏联新生活报著文\n    批评美固执助蒋政策\n    美国务院应更多的注意孙夫人声明\n    【新华社南京七日电】沪讯：本市苏联公民主办之俄文新生活报，于七月二十五日发表社论，题为“不是什么而是怎样”，评美国国务院对宋庆龄女士最近所发表对当前时局意见的反映。该社论称：美国务院用美国对华政策的公式来反对孙夫人的意见说，“我们对华政策正如我们一向所说的那样，是求中国的团结”，但是问题不在于标榜抽象的原则，善良的打算，而在寻求最好的道路和方法实现良好的原则和善良的打算。自然，谁也没有盼望过也并不盼望着美国务院发出这样声明说美国是要分裂中国，是要使争执的双方更加争执，并煽起更大的内战。第一、无论如何，美国的人民没有并且也不会有这样的意图；第二、即使美国某些统治人物有这样的意愿，他也无论如何不会在我们争民主和反法西斯的时代公开的不知羞愧的把这意思说出来。但是，国务院重述这赤裸裸抽象的公式来答复孙夫人坚请具体实现美国善良打算的声明，那就更加的百思不解了。该社论继称：美国对孙夫人声明的自然反映，应该重新审查美国对华的实际政策，这政策已快一年了，既没有在华建立民主政府，也没有能够使敌对的双方和解，更没有削弱长期流血内战的危险。中国报纸时常惊慌地指出美国在华威信的降低，此威信的降低，是由于马歇尔未能完成和解决的使命失败的原因，是因为美国武装不运出中国，美国只对单方协助。美国的国务院人士实在应多多注意孙夫人所表示的意见，因为他正如联合社所说，至少反映出中国人民百分之九十九的意见。不能单方面宣布善良的好听的打算，同时又不改变具体的政治行动，由于那种行动，中国人民已身受了好多个月的痛苦，降低了美国的威信。"

It solemnly pointed out that if the US-Chiang troops do not withdraw from the occupied areas, the soldiers and civilians of the Liberated Area will be forced to carry out righteous self-defense, and the US-Chiang side will be responsible for all consequences arising therefrom. The telegram stated: The area of over a hundred li between Tongzhou and Hexiwu on the Pingjin Highway was liberated by our sub-district's Eighth Route Army when the Japanese bandits surrendered. The US military requested to pass through, and in March of this year, it was permitted according to the instructions of the CCP member of the Executive Headquarters, Ye Jianying, and it was stipulated that a US flag should be used as a sign. Unexpectedly, the US side took advantage of this passage to make unreasonable provocations against our Liberated Area many times. On March 21, two of our scouts were shot and killed by four US soldiers traveling east from Tongzhou in a car while passing through the Pingjin Highway. On April 11, when the 21st Division of the Kuomintang 92nd Army invaded Liangji in the Tongxian Liberated Area, two cars full of US soldiers cooperated in the attack. The next day, the US troops of the division, under the pretext of \"bird shooting,\" fired at our stationed troops. In early July, the Kuomintang army built bunkers in Hexiwu, Wuqing, and the transport vehicles were all marked with US flags. Our army has always exercised the greatest tolerance in all the above unreasonable acts of aggression, avoiding direct conflict with them and urging them to realize their mistakes. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 a.m. on July 29, seventeen cars suddenly came from Tianjin, fully loaded with armed US soldiers, with no markings on the cars, and opened fire on our troops stationed in Anping Town. When we realized that they were US troops, we avoided conflict and automatically withdrew. However, the US troops threatened with automatic weapons, forcing our troops to be unable to withdraw and forced to implement self-defense, resulting in casualties on both sides. At 3:00 p.m., another twenty cars full of Kuomintang troops came from Tianjin to reinforce, and four US planes were sent from Ping to support the attack, coordinating land and air forces to attack us fiercely. Our army reluctantly dispersed and withdrew. However, the US-Chiang troops continued to fire at the surrounding villages for as long as five hours, causing heavy damage to residents' houses. After the US-Chiang troops occupied Anping Town, they added a unit of US troops, accompanied by three tanks and more than sixty cars, cooperating with the Kuomintang 92nd Army, to invade the Xianghe Liberated Area in three routes from Anping, Matou, and Hexiwu, thus making the situation serious. Regarding the settlement of the Anping incident, the telegram demanded that the US-Chiang troops immediately withdraw from all occupied areas, apologize and compensate the Liberated Area, punish the directly responsible officers, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美蒋合作三路进犯香河县  我冀东当局提出严重抗议  要求美蒋军立即退出侵占地区\n\n1946-08-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美蒋合作三路进犯香河县\n    我冀东当局提出严重抗议\n    要求美蒋军立即退出侵占地区\n    【新华社张家口七日电】军息：美蒋军联合侵占安平镇后，继续增兵，三路向解放区香河县进攻，冀东西线形势异常紧张。冀东军区第十四分区为此特电晋察冀军区司令聂荣臻将军，转北平执行部表示抗议，并严正指出美蒋军如不从侵占地区撤退，解放区军民将被迫进行正义自卫，由此引起的一切后果，当由美蒋方面负责。该电称：平津公路通州至河西务间百余里地区，日寇投降时即为我分区八路军解放。美军曾要求通过，今年三月经执行部中共叶剑英委员指示，予以允许，并规定需有美旗为标志，不意美方竟利用此通过之便，屡次向我解放区无理挑衅。三月二十一日，我侦察员二名通过平津公路时，突遭由通州乘汽车东开之美军四人击毙。四月十一日，国民党九十二军二十一师向通县解放区两集进犯时，有满载美军之汽车两辆配合进攻，次日，该部美军又借“打鸟”为名，向我驻扎部队射击。七月初，国民党军在武清河西务修筑碉堡，而运输汽车皆插有美旗。所有上述无理侵略事件，我军始终尽最大容忍，避免与其直接冲突，促其觉悟。讵料七月二十九日上午十一时，突有自天津开来汽车十七辆，满载武装美军，车上并无任何标志，向我安平镇驻军开枪射击。当我发现为美军时，即避免冲突自动撤退。但美军竟以自动火器威胁，逼使我军无法撤退，被迫实行自卫，双方均有伤亡。至下午三时，又有自津满载国民党军之汽车二十辆增援，并自平增援美机四架，陆空配合，向我猛犯，我军忍痛分散撤出。但美军与国民党军仍继续向周围村庄射击达五小时之久，居民房屋损失甚重。美蒋军占领安平镇后，复增加美军一部，附有坦克三辆，汽车六十余辆，配合国民党九十二军，由安平、马头、河西务分三路进犯香河解放区，事态因而严重。关于安平事件之解决，该电要求美蒋军立即撤出一切侵占地区，并向解放区赔偿道歉，处分直接负责军官，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。"

    "content": "Victory Belongs to the People\n　　Sun Dingguo\n　　On this day last year, the entire military and civilians of the Taiyue Region, like other liberated areas, responded to the call and orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. With unparalleled courage, they used the strength prepared over the past eight years for the sacred task of accepting the enemy's surrender and launching counterattacks. On August 14th, they approached the Yuncheng Salt Pond, forcing the Japanese Kou, Shao Jiubao, to issue a plea for surrender; on the 17th, they recovered the two cities of Xiaxian and Pinglu, completely severing the Tongpu southern section of the railway and clearing the large and small strongholds along both sides of the river. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek's Sixteenth Army, Yan Xishan's Thirty-fourth Army, Nineteenth Army, and Sixty-first Army, cooperated with the enemy and colluded with the puppets to support the enemy. They joined the enemy who wanted to surrender and Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan in launching an offensive and massacre against the people. The common people said it well: \"When the Japanese came, Lao Jiang and Lao Yan left, and they didn't want the common people; when the Eighth Route Army fought until the Japanese surrendered, Lao Jiang and Lao Yan came again, and they came to kill the common people.\" The Eighth Route Army and the common people are not afraid of being killed. If you want to kill them, they know how to deal with the killers. Therefore, under duress, the Eighth Route Army and the common people had to engage in five months of self-defense war, repelling countless enemy attacks, and finally, in coordination with the military and civilians of Taihang, recovered the famous city of Changzhi, which had always been surrounded by the Eighth Route Army, and achieved victory. It was thought that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan would clear their heads, and after the pain, retreat in the face of difficulty. Especially for the sake of the Chinese people, to get out of the sea of war and embark on peaceful construction, our party and the national democrats made concerted efforts, and Chairman Mao went to Chongqing with great wisdom and courage; finally, after all the efforts of the Political Consultative Conference and the major concessions of our party, the famous truce, military reorganization, and Political Consultative Conference resolutions were established. Chiang Kai-shek hypocritically issued four promises, and it was time to put down the butcher knife. But the result was the opposite. After our army resolutely implemented the ceasefire order and painfully withdrew from Quwo, what we got in return was further attacks and massacres by Chiang and Yan. To this day, the vast liberated areas of southern Shanxi along the Tongpu line and the Yellow River coast have been ignited by the flames of war by warmongers, and the democratic and free life of the liberated areas is about to return to darkness. Chiang Kai-shek's ambition to fear that the world will not be in chaos, that China will not perish, and that the people will not die is becoming more and more obvious; his murderous face is becoming clearer and clearer; and his traitorous and country-selling behavior is becoming more and more unprecedentedly cruel and vicious; especially with the support of American imperialist elements, he is becoming more and more energetic. The military and civilians of the Taiyue Region, like the military and civilians of other liberated areas, are military and civilians who have been tempered by eight years of anti-Japanese war and nearly a year of self-defense war. Japanese imperialism cannot eliminate us, American imperialist elements cannot scare us, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot defeat us. We are military and civilians under the leadership of the Communist Party, military and civilians supported by the forces of peace and democracy throughout the world and China, and military and civilians who have been cultivated and educated for many years by Chairman Mao's guiding ideology of not surrendering. We resolutely support peace. For the sake of peace, we have been so painfully patient in the past, but there is a limit to concessions. At the same time, we are most resolutely opposed to civil war. For the sake of peace, we also understand how to carry out the most resolute struggle. Comrades fighting in the entire region! Comrades of the militia and self-defense forces! We are the people's own soldiers, we are the protectors of the people's interests, we should be very resolutely with the people, and in order to defend the motherland, defend victory, and defend peace and democracy, give Chiang Kai-shek's offensive the punishment it deserves! Let us raise six million iron fists to give those attackers a severe blow! We welcome the people in the rear to fight with us; we welcome Chiang and Yan's officers and soldiers to oppose the civil war for the sake of the motherland and the people, and also for their own sake, and to learn from General Gao Shuxun, Captain Liu Shanben, General Lei Wenqing, and all the anti-civil war soldiers of the Lei Department. We welcome the American people and democrats to join us in stopping American imperialist elements from helping Chiang Kai-shek. The great August 10th Victory Day belongs to the people, and the victory of peace and democracy must also belong to the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 胜利是人民的\n孙定国\n1946-08-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　胜利是人民的\n    孙定国\n    太岳区全体军民在去年的今日，和其他解放区一样响应了毛主席朱总司令的号召与命令，以英勇无比的姿态，把八年来准备的力量使用在接受敌人投降与反攻的神圣任务上，八月十四日接近了运城盐池，迫使日寇少久保发出了乞降的哀鸣；十七日收复了夏县、平陆两城，整个打断同蒲南段铁路，以及肃清沿河两侧的大小据点。就在这个时候蒋介石的十六军，阎锡山的三十四军，十九军、六十一军，用与敌合作、与伪合流的方式来给敌人撑了腰。使要投降的敌人与蒋介石阎锡山在一起，开始了对人民的进攻和大屠杀。老百姓讲的好：“日本人来了，老蒋老阎就走了，走了是不要老百姓；八路军打得日本人投降了，老蒋老阎又来了，来了是杀老百姓。”八路军和老百姓是不怕杀的，你要杀他，他知道怎样对付杀人者。因之，在被迫的情况下，八路军和老百姓就不得不进行了五个月的自卫战争，打退了敌人无数次的进攻，终于与太行军民配合，收复了始终在八路军包围中的长治名城，取得胜利。方以为蒋介石、阎锡山会清醒一下头脑，创痛之余，知难而退，特别是为了中国老百姓，脱离战争苦海走上和平建设，我党与全国民主人士一致努力，毛主席大智大勇，亲到重庆；最后经过政协一切努力与我党重大让步，成立了有名的停战、整军与政协决议。蒋介石假惺惺的发布了四项诺言，应是放下杀人刀的时候了。而其结果又相反，在我军坚决执行停战命令忍痛退出曲沃之后，换得来的又是蒋阎的进一步的进攻和大屠杀。时至今日，同蒲沿线，黄河沿岸我晋南的广大解放区，已由好战分子的手燃起了大战的烽火，要解放区的民主自由生活再回到黑暗中去。蒋介石唯恐天下不乱，中国不亡，人民不死的野心是暴露得愈来愈明显了；他这一付杀人的狰狞面目，愈来愈清楚了；汉奸卖国的行为，也愈来愈加空前残酷与毒辣了；特别是在美帝国主义分子支持之下，更是愈来愈有劲头了。太岳区军民和其它解放区军民一样，是经过八年抗日锻炼的军民，是将近一年来自卫战争的军民了，日本帝国主义消灭不了我们，美帝国主义分子就吓不倒我们，蒋介石就打不败我们，我们是在共产党领导之下的军民，是在全世界全中国和平民主势力拥护与支持下的军民，是在毛主席没有屈服两个字的指导思想陶冶与教育多年的军民。我们坚决拥护和平，为了和平我们过去如何的忍痛的，但是有限度的让步，同时我们又最坚决反对内战，为了和平我们又了解如何的进行最坚决的斗争。全区作战的同志们！民兵自卫队同志们！我们是人民的子弟兵，我们是人民利益的保卫者，我们应十分坚决的和人民在一起，为了保卫祖国、保卫胜利、保卫和平民主，给蒋介石的进攻以应有的惩罚吧！让我们举起六百万只铁拳给那些进攻者以严重打击！我们欢迎大后方的人民和我们一起来斗争；我们欢迎蒋阎军官兵为祖国为人民计，同时也是为自己计，反对内战，学习高树勋将军、刘善本上尉、雷文清将军与雷部全体反内战的士兵同志。我们欢迎美国人民民主人士和我们一起制止美国帝国主义分子对蒋介石的帮助。伟大的八月十日的胜利日，是属于人民的，和平、民主的胜利，也一定是人民的。"

    "content": "[Weixian, 6th Dispatch] The entire Gaotang region joyously celebrates its liberation, with all puppet troops stationed outside the city disarmed. Beginning June 29th, our troops launched a punitive expedition against the puppet bandits in various areas outside the city. That very night, the entire puppet force of Luo Zhaorong, entrenched in villages around Xingjia Temple in the county, was routed. Our troops pressed southward, directly assaulting the old lair of the traitor Pang Changshen, encircling the strongholds of Xuguantun, Niuguantun, Wulipu, and others, and capturing them all on July 4th and 6th. Simultaneously, another unit of our troops swept away the puppet force of Wu Chunyang from the strongholds of Yuanzhuang and Zhuzhuang in the third district of Gaotang. The southern Gaotang campaign concluded victoriously. On the 9th, our troops marched north, immediately capturing the strongholds of Sanguanmiao, Yangguantun, Xiaoli, and Liuzhuang, defended by the puppet bandits Yang Jingzhai, Chen Songling, Deng Xiezhen, and others north of the city. On the 12th, we decisively captured Yunzhuang, the old lair of the puppet bandit Yun Maocai east of the city, completely isolating the puppet bandit Chen Shengtang's force entrenched in the seventh and eighth districts of Gaotang. This puppet force was annihilated by us by the end of July. The entire Gaotang region is now free of bandits. This campaign liberated over 500 villages of all sizes, and over 15,000 puppet bandits were disarmed. The 200,000 people of Gaotang have regained a democratic and free life.\n　　[Jiaozuo, 7th Urgent Dispatch] According to information obtained by our reporter: Bai Chongxi, again acting on instructions from Chiang Kai-shek, \"preliminarily reviewed\" the Kuomintang troops in northern Henan on July 30th. It is also reported that Chiang Kai-shek himself will soon personally inspect the troops on various battlefields, urging them to attack the Communist troops. Bai Chongxi, accompanied by Liu Zhi, arrived in Xin on July 30th by special train from Zhengzhou. It is understood that Bai and Liu carry a secret mission from Chiang Kai-shek, to convene military conferences of important officers above the battalion level, and redeploy attacks on our liberated areas in northern and eastern Henan, in coordination with their new offensives against Jinpu, northern Henan, and southern Shanxi. The troops already inspected include one division each from the 85th and 32nd Armies.\n　　[Our Newspaper, Yangcheng, 7th Dispatch] In early July, the Kuomintang 47th Division, which had crossed the river to invade the Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) highway in southern Shanxi, was forced to retreat in disarray into Wenxi city on the 28th under the self-defense counterattacks of our local army and civilians. Zhangdian and Maojindu have been recovered by us. Thus, the entire Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) highway has been liberated again. Over a hundred Chiang soldiers were killed by our militia, and twenty-three laid down their arms. We seized four machine guns, one grenade launcher, over forty rifles, and over ten thousand catties of grain.\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 7th Dispatch] The Yan puppet troops entrenched in Huairen and Kouquan (fifteen kilometers southwest of Datong) fled the cities on the 2nd. The Eighth Route Army in northern Yanbei, at the request of the people, has entered the above two cities separately, and social order in both places is rapidly being restored. Huairen is an important town in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway and the southern gateway to Datong. Kouquan is a nationally renowned mining area. The 2nd and 3rd Regiments of the 38th Division of the Yan army entrenched in these two places were entirely reorganized from puppet police and enemy special agent teams. Regiment commanders Li Baocai and Zhang Zonghan were both special envoys sent by Yan Xishan to Taiyuan and Datong to liaise with the enemy before the Japanese surrender. After the Japanese surrender, Yan Xishan used these puppet troops as vanguards in attacking the liberated areas. They forcibly occupied dozens of villages, carrying out wanton burning, killing, and raping, harming the people. The people of both places are overjoyed at their liberation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 运东高唐全境解放  我解散伪军万五千  晋南张茅公路全线重入我手  雁北我军进驻怀仁口泉\n\n1946-08-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　运东高唐全境解放\n    我解散伪军万五千\n    晋南张茅公路全线重入我手\n    雁北我军进驻怀仁口泉\n    【威县六日电】高唐全境庆获解放，盘踞城外的伪军全部解除武装。六月二十九日起我军即向城外伪匪各部展开讨逆战役，当夜即将盘踞该县邢家寺一带村庄的伪罗兆荣部全部击溃，我军乘胜向南扩展，直捣庞逆长申老窠，将徐官屯、牛官屯、五里铺等据点层层包围，于七月四、六两日即全部攻克。同时，我军另部，又将高唐三区袁庄、祝庄等据点的伪军吴春阳部一扫而光，高唐城南战役胜利结束。九日，我军挥师北上，当即攻克城北伪匪杨静斋、陈松龄、邓协忱等部踞守之三官庙、杨官屯、小李、六庄等据点。十二日，复将城东伪匪云茂才老窠云庄一举攻克，盘踞高唐七八区之伪匪陈盛棠部遂完全孤立，该部伪匪至七月底为我歼灭，高唐全境已无匪踪，此役共解放大小村庄五百余处，伪匪一万五千余人被解除武装。高唐二十万人民重新获得民主自由生活。\n    【焦作七日急电】据记者获息：白崇禧再度奉蒋介石指示，于七月三十日“预行检阅”豫北国民党各部队，并闻蒋介石亦将于最近亲赴各战场检阅部队，督促向中共军进攻。白崇禧于三十日上午偕刘峙自郑州乘专车抵新。据悉，白、刘此行，携有蒋介石机密任务，召开营以上重要军官军事会议，重新布置进攻我豫北豫东解放区，以配合其对津浦豫北晋南新的攻势。已受阅部队有八十五军、三十二军各一个师。\n    【本报阳城七日电】七月上旬，渡河侵占晋南张（店）茅（津）公路之国民党四十七师，在我当地军民自卫反击下于二十八日狼狈退入闻喜城，张店、茅津渡，遂被我收复，至此张（店）茅（津）公路全线重获解放。蒋军百余人为我民兵击毙，二十三人放下武器，缴机枪四挺，掷弹筒一个，步枪四十余枝，粮食万余斤。\n    【新华社兴县七日电】盘据于怀仁及口泉（大同西南十五公里）之阎伪军，于二日弃城逃窜，雁北八路军应人民之请，已分别进驻上述两城，现两地社会秩序正迅速恢复中。怀仁为同蒲线北段重镇，大同之南面门户。口泉为全国闻名之矿区，该两地盘踞之阎军三十八师二三两团，全系伪警及敌之特务队改编而成，团长李保才、张踪汉都是在日寇投降前阎锡山派赴太原、大同与敌联络之专使。日寇投降后，阎锡山利用该伪军作进攻解放区之先锋，先后被其强占村庄数十处，大肆烧杀奸淫，为害人民。此次两地人民获得解放，莫不欢欣若狂。"

    "content": "[This article transmitted from] Yangcheng, August 5th: The Taiyue Military Region summarized the situation of the self-defense war in the region since July, stating that the Southern Shanxi Self-Defense War has achieved preliminary victory. After Dong Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the 38th Group Army of the Kuomintang, and Luo Lie, Commander of the First Army, went to Nanjing for a meeting in late June, they mobilized a total of seven divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops. At the beginning of July, they fiercely attacked our Southern Shanxi Liberated Area. By the 11th, the Chiang Kai-shek troops successively occupied Maojin Ferry, Zhangdian, and the entire Yuncheng-Maojin Highway, and continued northward along the Anyi-Yuncheng-Datong Railway, successively occupying towns such as Shuitou, Yanzhang, Huzhang, Guodian, and Wenxi, as well as more than 460 large and small villages. In the occupied areas, Chiang Kai-shek's troops universally forced \"maintenance\" and carried out rape, massacre, and terror. The vast military and civilians in Southern Shanxi were forced to rise up in self-defense. It is reported that hundreds of thousands of militiamen in Xia County bravely cooperated with the Eighth Route Army in continuously annihilating most of the 31st Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, as well as parts of the 167th Division and the 78th Division, totaling more than 3,500 people, in the several days of the 13th and 16th, capturing 38 various cannons, more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 1,000 rifles. The vast occupied areas east of the Wenxi-Shuitou line were completely restored. On the 28th, after Zhangdian and Maojin were recovered, the entire Zhangdian-Maojin Highway was also liberated. The Chiang Kai-shek troops' attempt to open the Datong Railway between Yuncheng and Linfen has not yet been realized. South of Taiyuan, Yan Xishan's troops on the northern Datong line, in order to echo the Chiang Kai-shek troops' attack on Southern Shanxi, also concentrated superior forces and carried out key advances towards Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, and Huoxian, launching a total of 57 attacks on us, invading more than a dozen important villages and towns such as Dongquan, Jingdao, Baohe, and Jinbi. The local Eighth Route Army resolutely counterattacked, and all the occupied villages and towns were immediately restored. On the 19th, more than 900 Yan Xishan troops who invaded Shangguan, south of Quwo, were largely annihilated by us. The puppet troops of Duan Bingchang in Qin County, in the Baijin area, echoing the attack of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's troops, were disarmed on the 21st under the siege of local military and civilians, and Qin County and Wuxiang were completely liberated. At this point, the Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, and puppet troops who invaded this area have all been compressed into a narrow area along the Zhengtai and Datong lines. However, the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan troops, whose ambitions have not died, are now preparing for a second offensive. According to reports, the area south of Linfen (some say south of Hanxinling in Lingshi) has been assigned to the Chiang Kai-shek troops for takeover, while the area north and the Zhengtai line have been assigned to the Yan Xishan troops, in order to concentrate forces and launch a coordinated offensive from the north and south. It is now reported that four divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops (47th, 78th, 167th, and New 1st) have been assembled between Wenxi and Shuitou. The 53rd Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, originally stationed in Meng County, has also been increased to Anyi, preparing to move out at any time. On the southern section of the Datong Railway, most of the 39th Division and 66th Division of Yan Xishan's troops stationed in Linfen have been transferred to Hongdong and Zhaocheng, and the headquarters of the 61st Army has moved to Huoxian. The 69th Division was transferred to Huoxian on the 29th, and the 72nd Division originally stationed in Xinjiang is also continuing to move north. Fierce battles are currently taking place in the Lingshi and Huoxian areas.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, August 8th: Huairen and Kouquan in northern Shanxi were liberated on the 2nd.

    "content": "[This newspaper Yangcheng news] On the afternoon of the 3rd, over 2,000 people from all walks of life in Taiyue gathered in Yangcheng to mourn Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, as well as the comrades who sacrificed themselves in the direct organs over the past year. Director Niu solemnly narrated the life and death of the martyred comrades, pointing out that they all sacrificed themselves for the independence, peace, and democracy of the country. Comrade Gui Shaobin, representative of the District Party Committee, said: \"Chiang Kai-shek is launching a nationwide civil war. In addition to military offensives, he is also stepping up his secret service policies. Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were shot to death in broad daylight by armed secret agents. Our comrades from the Administrative Office Cadre School, Zhang Yaobu and others, were assassinated by secret agents while leading the masses to stand up. We must avenge these martyred comrades.\" Deputy Commander Sun said with great grief and indignation: \"Today is a memorial service, and also a rally against civil war and against secret agents. These forty-one comrades sacrificed themselves for the people. Some are Communist Party members, and some, though not Communist Party members, are also good students of Chairman Mao and good children of the people. They did their best and sacrificed themselves for the people. We resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's secret service policy and eliminate armed secret agents.\" Mr. Gao Yanliu, an old gentleman from the Henan Democratic National Construction Association, shouted with grief and indignation: \"The sacrifice of these martyrs was caused by secret agents. Under Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship, even a professor, writer, or scholar cannot survive. His brutality exceeds that of the worst tyrants in history, and it is a collection of all the abuses and atrocities of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. However, Chiang Kai-shek's arrogance is just a dying struggle, outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Relying on the assistance of his foreign ancestors to attack the people of all of China will surely be submerged by the democratic tide of the world.\" Yangcheng Councilor Wang Yuan said with a simple peasant demeanor and in a solemn voice: \"Chiang Kai-shek wants to harm the country and the people and sell out the country. This is impossible. Because our farmers have been mobilized and united, and this is an invincible force forever.\" Mr. Zhang Wenxuan, a family member of a martyr, said very sadly: \"My child, Zhang Zhanyun, was a student at the Administrative Office Cadre School. He went to Jiang County to mobilize the masses and was surrounded by armed secret agents at night. His hand was cut three times, but he did not throw away the gun he was carrying, but fought desperately with the secret agents until he was killed. It is glorious to die for the people, and everyone will avenge him.\" The conference also telegraphed the whole country, opposing civil war and opposing secret agents, stating:\n　　Our Taiyue Liberated Area is one of the front lines of the civil war, and also an area where Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's secret agents are rampant. Since the beginning of July, 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan troops have frantically attacked our Southern Fen Liberated Area, occupying Wenxi City and more than 400 large and small villages and towns within ten days. Wherever the iron hooves go, houses are turned into ruins. And the activities of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan secret agents and bandits are even more ubiquitous, poisoning and assassinating, doing everything possible to inflict human misery. In the Wufujian tragedy in Yuanqu, 57 militiamen died at one time, and recently a shocking incident of poisoning by secret agents occurred in Jiyuan, with more than 300 people poisoned at one time, and more than 40 people died without rescue. What crime have the people committed to suffer such poisonous hands? This is tolerable, what is intolerable? The telegram continued: The people of our Taiyue District deeply know from their own experience that only self-defense and only struggle can protect the lives of the people and protect China's independence, peace, and democracy.\n　　[This newspaper Changzhi news] Over a thousand cadres from the Taihang Military Region and the same level of Party, government, military, and civilian organs held a \"Commemoration of August 1st, Mourning Martyrs, Anti-Civil War, and Anti-Secret Agent Rally\" on August 1st. The meeting place was decorated with huge banners that read \"Commemorate the Birthday of the Eighth Route Army and Always Maintain the Glorious Tradition of the People's Army\" and \"To Live for the People and Die for the People is the True Color of a Hero, Forever Immortal.\" At the beginning of the meeting, everyone bowed to pay tribute to Comrades Guan Xiangying and Luo Binghui, who died for the cause of people's democracy, and Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. Director Yuan Ziqin of the Military Region's Political Department pointed out in his speech: Our troops still have remnants of warlordism. Comrades in the troops should pay special attention to overcoming this bad style. Party, government, and civilian comrades should provide more help and supervision to the troops. He called on everyone to learn from the spirit of Comrades Guan and Luo, who were loyal to the Party and the country and wholeheartedly served the people. Political Commissar Li Xuefeng took the stage amidst applause. After elaborating on the experience of building the army, he called on everyone to cherish the masses, help the masses to stand up, and guard against arrogance and impatience to unite well, defeat the attacks of the Kuomintang fascists, and fight for the independence, peace, and democracy of the whole country.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳太行热烈集会纪念“八一”  追悼先烈反对内战  通电全国揭露蒋特暴行\n\n1946-08-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳太行热烈集会纪念“八一”            \n    追悼先烈反对内战 \n    通电全国揭露蒋特暴行\n    【本报阳城讯】三日下午，太岳各界二千余人在阳城集会，追悼李公朴、闻一多先生暨直属机关一年来牺牲的同志。牛主任首先沉痛叙述了死难烈士的生平和遇害的经过，指出他们都是为求国家之独立、和平、民主而牺牲的。区党委代表桂绍彬同志说：“蒋介石正在发动全国规模的内战，他除了军事进攻外，又加紧特务政策，李、闻二先生是在光天化日下被武装特务用乱枪打死的。我们行署干校张耀步等同志，是在领导群众翻身时被特务暗杀的。我们要为这些死难烈士复仇”。孙副司令员满怀悲愤的说：“今天是追悼会，同时也是反内战反特务大会。我们这四十一位同志是为人民牺牲的，有的是共产党员，有的虽不是共产党员，也是毛主席的好学生，人民的好子弟。他们鞠躬尽瘁，为人民牺牲了，我们坚决反对蒋介石的特务政策，消灭武装特务。”河南民主建国协会高延柳老先生发出了悲愤的喊声：“这些烈士的牺牲是被特务打死的，在蒋介石的专政下，就是一个教授文人学者也无法生存，其残暴超过历史上最坏的暴君，集古今中外虐政暴行之大成，但是蒋介石这样横行霸道不过是没落的挣扎，外强中干。仗凭他洋祖宗的援助来向全中国的人民开刀，必为世界的民主潮流所淹没。”阳城参议员王源以朴实的农民姿态，悲壮地说：“蒋介石要祸国殃民，出卖国家，这是办不到的。因为我们农民已经发动起来了，团结起来了，这便是永远打不垮的力量”。烈士家属张文选老先生很沉痛的说：“我的孩子张占云是行署干校的学生，到绛县发动群众，晚上被武装特务包围，手上被砍了三刀，但他没有把他带的枪扔了，还是和特务拚命，最后才被杀了。为人民而死是光荣的，大家会给他报仇的。”大会并通电全国，反对内战、反对特务，略称：\n    我太岳解放区是内战前线之一，也是蒋阎特务逞凶活动的一个地区，自七月初开始，蒋阎军两万之众疯狂向我汾南解放区进攻，十日之内占我闻喜城及大小村镇四百余处，铁蹄所至，庐舍为墟。而蒋阎特务土匪的活动更无孔不入，放毒暗杀。极尽人间之惨毒。垣曲五福涧惨案一次死民兵五十七人，而最近济源更发生特务放毒的惊人事件，一次中毒者三百余人，四十余人不救而死，人民何辜遭此毒手？此而可忍，孰不可忍？继称：我太岳区人民从切身经历中，深知只有自卫、只有奋斗、才能保卫人民的生命，保卫中国的独立和平与民主。\n    【本报长治讯】太行军区暨同级党政军民机关干部千余人，于八月一日举行“纪念八一追悼先烈反内战反特务大会”。会场张挂“纪念八路军生日始终保持人民军队光荣传统”、“为人民而生，为人民而死，是英雄本色，永垂不朽”的巨幅标语。会议开始，首向为人民民主事业而死的关向应、罗炳辉二同志，李公朴、闻一多两先生鞠躬致哀。军区政治部袁主任子钦讲话时指出：我区部队目前还有着军阀主义作风的残余，部队同志要特别注意克服此种不良的作风，党政民同志要更多帮助监督部队。他号召大家学习关罗二同志忠心党国、全心全意为人民服务的精神。李政委雪峰在掌声中登台讲话，在详述建军经验之后，他号召爱护群众，帮助群众翻身，并戒骄戒燥好好团结，击退国民党法西斯派的进攻，为全国的独立和平民主而奋斗。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: Due to opposition from democratic individuals and groups in Pan-American countries, the Pan-American Conference, promoted by the United States, has been forced to postpone its meeting repeatedly. The conference was originally scheduled for July but failed to take place. Later, Brazil (the host country) suggested holding it in November, but Benes stated in Paris on the 7th that the timing was \"not yet ripe.\" The purpose of this conference was to discuss how to implement the Chapultepec Act, which was passed in Chapultepec, Mexico. This act stipulates that the Western Hemisphere will implement joint defense under the control of the United States. The people of Latin American countries unanimously oppose the plan of American imperialists to control the military and defense of Pan-American countries under the guise of joint defense. U.S. congressmen, also mindful of the upcoming elections, have not dared to rashly pass the Pan-American countries' extensive military cooperation plan (i.e., arming and training the armies of these countries to suit U.S. standards for easy control). These reasons have forced the Pan-American Conference to be postponed again and again. However, it is worth noting that U.S. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower has arrived in Brazil to engage in activities.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: TASS, Washington dispatch: Mexico's \"El Demócrata\" newspaper reported that Latin American protests against the U.S. plan to \"defend\" the Western Hemisphere are growing. The Peruvian Communist Party's newspaper \"La Voz del Trabajo\" stated that accepting this plan would subordinate Latin American countries to the U.S. military, thereby strangling their sovereignty. The United States, under the guise of modernizing the armaments of the republican nations, is concealing its imperialist monopolistic conspiracy to sell us weapons and increase their profits, and these weapons can be used to incite civil war when it is in their interests. \"La Voz del Trabajo\" condemned the United States for continuing to occupy the Peruvian base of Iquitos.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 泛美会议被迫延期  秘共机关报指责美国阴谋\n\n1946-08-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　泛美会议被迫延期  \n    秘共机关报指责美国阴谋\n　　【新华社延安八日电】在泛美各国民主人士与团体的反对下，美国主催的泛美会议被迫一再延期举行，此一会议之会期曾定为七月，然未能举行，后巴西（东道口）建议十一月举行，而贝纳斯于七日在巴黎表示，认为时机“尚未成熟”。按此次会议之目的，为讨论如何实行曾在墨西哥洽普特匹克城通过之洽普特匹克法案，此一法案，规定西半球在美国支配下实行共同防卫。对于美国帝国主义分子企图借共同防卫之名以行控制泛美各国军事与国防之实的计划，拉丁美洲各国人民一致反对。美国会议员对于泛美各国广泛军事合作计划（即武装与训练各该国军队以适合美国标准便于控制），亦鉴于改选在即，未敢贸然通过。这些原因遂使泛美会议一再被迫延期。惟美陆军参谋总长艾森豪威尔已抵巴西活动，值得注意。\n    【新华社延安八日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：墨西哥“拉开的密斯”报报导：拉丁美洲对美国“防御”西半球计划的抗议，正日益增长。秘鲁共产党机关报“劳工”报称：接受此计划，即将使拉丁美洲各国从属于美国军队，因而绞死他们的主权。美国借使共和国家武装近代化的名义，掩盖自己帝国主义垄断的阴谋，以售给我们武器，增强他们的利润，而此种武器在有利于他们的利益时，可以作为煽起内战之用。“劳工”报谴责美国继续占领秘鲁基地伊巴托。"

During the recent Suzhong Self-Defense War, there were many heroic and moving deeds that demonstrated the high degree of mutual love and self-sacrifice among the military and civilians in the liberated areas. One day, on the southern front of Rugao, when two Chiang Kai-shek planes suddenly emerged from the clouds, their sharp engines roaring overhead, Wang Debiao, a soldier of a certain New Fourth Army unit, quickly directed the masses to take cover. A logistics team member lay down on the nearby low ground. Wang Debiao plucked a large handful of weeds to cover him up as camouflage, and repeatedly advised him not to be afraid. However, Wang Debiao himself did not have time to hide and was shot and killed. After the planes flew away, the logistics team member climbed up from the low ground and saw that Wang had fallen in a pool of blood. He threw himself on Wang's body, wanting to cry out loud, but at that moment, the Chiang Kai-shek planes flew back again.

The No. 1 Army of Wang Kangde under the command of the puppet Zhang Lanfeng, one of the main forces participating in the Yudong \"suppression\", moved from Zhecheng area to the Longhai line east of Lanfeng at the end of last month. The 81st Division of the Chiang Kai-shek's army has also been transferred from Qi County, the central area of eastern Henan, to Chenliu, southwest of Lanfeng. The remaining defense tasks are carried out with key deployments. On the one hand, small groups of troops are sent out to harass us daily, and on the other hand, fortifications are being built to continue their \"suppression\" of eastern Henan. On the 23rd, Liu Maoen, Chairman of Henan Province, personally went to Lanfeng to mobilize the Chiang Kai-shek's troops concentrated in the area for a civil war. He also gave secret instructions to a certain Hu, the administrative commissioner of the Kuomintang in the area, urging him to quickly supervise the local military and civilians to rush to repair the fortifications along the line, and put forward slogans such as \"recovering\" lost land from us. Currently, there are four ammunition depots storing ammunition in Lanfeng city. At present, the Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the area are seizing laborers to rush to repair the two supply lines of grain, forage, and ammunition from Lanfeng to Kaocheng and from Lanfeng to Liuhezhen (north of Zhongling). The situation on the Longhai Railway is now suddenly becoming tense.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, August 8th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops entrenched in Qingyangdian, 35 miles west of Zouping City, frequently harassed us.

On the morning of the 2nd, the 96th Army of the Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who had invaded Zouping, Zhangqiu, and other places, rushed to reinforce them, but were troubled by the militia's minefields and then defeated by the Eighth Route Army.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, August 7th] Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the Jinzhou-Gubeikou line have begun attacking the Rehe liberated area. On the 30th of last month, two regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops stationed in Yebaishou advanced along the Chifeng-Yebaishou Railway. As of the 2nd of this month, they have successively occupied the two towns of Tianyi and Nailin. A regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's troops stationed in Lingyuan advanced north, echoing the Chiang Kai-shek's troops on both sides of the Chifeng-Yebaishou line, and successively occupied Reshuitang, over a hundred miles northeast of Lingyuan, and Banjaying and Haizhongnao and other places northwest of Lingyuan on the 1st. As of the 5th, the war is still expanding. Duan Suquan, Major General and the Communist Party representative of the Central Group of the Chengde Executive Headquarters, has submitted a memorandum to the Beiping Executive Headquarters regarding the provocation of the Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacking the Rehe liberated area, recounting the Kuomintang's violation of the agreement reached between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the 26th Group in Chaoyang before July 25 to hold a chiefs' meeting, demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek's troops' offensive actions be stopped, otherwise the Kuomintang will be responsible for all the consequences.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋伪军大量集中兰封  陇海线形势突趋紧张  蒋军破坏协议开始进攻热河解放区\n\n1946-08-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋伪军大量集中兰封  \n    陇海线形势突趋紧张  \n    蒋军破坏协议开始进攻热河解放区\n　　【本报荷泽一日电】“清剿”豫东解放区的蒋伪军，现正向陇海线上之兰封大量集中，企图向我突然进犯。参加豫东“清剿”主力之一的伪张岚峰部第一军王康德部，已于上月底自柘城一带开至兰封以东的陇海沿线，蒋军八十一师亦自豫东中心区的杞县，调至兰封西南的陈留，其遗留防务则采取重点配备，一面每日派出小股部队出扰，一面则大修碉堡工事，以继续其对豫东的“清剿”。二十三日，河南省主席刘茂恩更亲至兰封向集中于该县一带的蒋伪军进行内战动员，并向该地区国民党行政专员胡某面授机密，嘱其迅速督促该地军民赶修沿线碉堡工事，提出向我“收复”失地等口号。现兰封城内，已有四处军火库储备弹药，目前该地蒋伪军正大抓民夫赶修兰封至考城兰封至柳河镇（中陵北）的两条粮秣弹药供应线。现陇海线形势突趋紧张。\n    【新华社惠民八日电】盘据邹平城西三十五里青阳店蒋军不时出扰，当地民兵配合八路军于一日夜间进行反击，计毙伤蒋军百余，生擒三十余，缴获机枪七挺。二日晨侵占邹平、章邱等地之蒋军九十六军驰来增援，则遭民兵地雷阵的困扰后，为八路军击溃。\n    【新华社承德七日电】锦古线蒋军开始进攻热河解放区，上月三十日驻叶柏寿蒋军两个团，沿赤叶铁路进犯，截至本月二日止，已先后侵占天义、乃林两镇。驻凌源蒋军一个团，向北进犯，与赤叶线两侧之蒋军相呼应，于一日先后侵占凌源东北百余里之热水汤，与凌源西北之板家营、孩众脑等地，截至五日止，战事仍在扩大中。驻承德执行组中心小组中共代表段苏权少将对于蒋军进攻热河解放区之挑衅，已以备忘录呈交北平执行部，历述国民党方面破坏七月二十五日以前朝阳第二十六小组国共双方商定召开长官会议之协议，要求制止蒋军进攻行为，否则所生一切后果应由国民党方面负责。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 6th: Militias in various parts of the Shandong Liberated Area are cooperating with the main forces to block the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops in order to defend their peaceful and democratic happy life. In the Lucentral District, tens of thousands of militias in Boshan and Shou Counties, more than 1,800 miners in the Zibo mining area, and more than 700 employees of the Shentou Electric Power Company are actively展开ing activities near the mining area. The Zhangqiu County militia Li Yuquan explosives team has killed and wounded more than 130 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in several explosions. On the 16th of last month, Li Yuquan led his team to set up a minefield on the road where Chiang Kai-shek's troops were advancing north of Shilipu Village (west of Longzhuang Station on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway). When a company of the 12th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops passed nearby that day, the militia immediately used firepower to force the Chiang Kai-shek troops into the minefield. Suddenly, a series of mines exploded, killing all 30-plus Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. In the Qiunan District, when Chiang Kai-shek's ×× Army attacked Yixian and other places in the Liberated Area on the 19th of last month, the militia formed a self-defense joint defense team and carried out elusive guerrilla warfare day and night, fighting 12 times in three days. On the 21st of last month, when a company of the 37th Division of the said army invaded Zhangzhuang, more than ten li north of ××, the Zhangzhuang militia laid mines on one side and fired volleys suddenly, and then blocked the enemy separately, forcing the invading army to flee back. The militias in various places said with great confidence: \"This time we have the opportunity to go to the front line to exchange for better guns.\"\nXinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 5th: Militias in the Central Jiangsu and Northern Anhui Liberated Areas are bravely participating in the self-defense war. On July 17, the Jingjiang militia in the First Sub-district attacked Qianjiashi, an important town northeast of Jingcheng occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and rescued more than 1,000 citizens detained by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Four thousand militias on the Yang (zhou) Tai (zhou) line in the Second Sub-district launched assaults on the Yi (Zhou northeast fifty li) to Zhutou (Zhou northeast sixty-five li) line, destroying 25 li of roads, two bridgeheads, and one blockhouse, delaying the advance of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. On the 15th of last month, the Kuomintang township chiefs of Sunjiazhuang, Qianjiazhuang and other places in Qintong County of the district led \"self-defense teams\" to harass the edge of the Liberated Area. They were severely attacked by the local militia. After 20 minutes of fierce fighting, four rifles were seized, two of which were American-made. The militia in the Shitou District of Binghui County (renamed from Tianchang) in the Third Sub-district organized combat platoons to the front line, and defended the three Litou more than ten li south of Binghui, blocking the fierce attack of Chiang Kai-shek's troops for a whole day and night. Since Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied the entire Liberated Area west of the Huainan Road in the Fourth Sub-district, the local militia has persisted in the self-defense struggle, and has recovered Hongxinfu, Xiaoxihe Station in Fengyang County, and Caojiadian and other places in Dingyuan County, seizing dozens of guns and eliminating more than 70 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. The Central China Military Region specially issued an order to commend the heroic self-defense actions of the people in various places.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阻敌扰敌地雷爆炸  山东华中民兵英勇自卫  章邱县民兵爆炸队毙伤蒋军百余\n\n1946-08-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阻敌扰敌地雷爆炸            \n    山东华中民兵英勇自卫         \n    章邱县民兵爆炸队毙伤蒋军百余\n    【新华社临沂六日电】山东解放区各地民兵，为保卫和平民主的幸福生活，正配合主力阻击进犯蒋军。在鲁中区博山寿县万余民兵，淄博矿区一千八百余矿工，神头电力公司等七百余职工，在矿区附近积极展开活动。章邱县民兵李玉泉爆炸队，在几次爆炸中曾毙伤蒋军一百卅余。上月十六日，李玉泉率队在十里铺村（胶济路西段龙庄车站西）北面蒋军出犯路上布置一地雷阵，当日蒋军十二军一个连经过附近，民兵即以火力迫使蒋军进入地雷阵地，顿时群雷轰炸，蒋军三十余人全部毙命。在邱南区，当蒋军××军于上月十九日进攻解放区峄县等地时，民兵组成自卫联防队，日夜进行神出鬼没的麻雀战，三天内作战十二次。上月二十一日，该军三十七师一个连，向××北方十余里张庄进犯时，张庄民兵一面布置地雷，一面忽而集中打排枪，忽而分头阻击，进犯军被迫窜回。各地民兵极有信心地说：“这回可有上火线换好枪的机会了。”\n    【新华社淮阴五日电】苏中淮南解放区民兵英勇参加自卫战争。一分区靖江民兵于七月十七日袭入靖城东北被蒋军侵占的重镇嵌家市，解救了被蒋军拘押的市民千余人。二分区扬（州）泰（州）线上四千民兵在宜诙（扬州东北五十里）至柱头（扬州东北六十五里）一线进行突击，破路二十五里，拆毁桥头二座，炮楼一座，迟滞了蒋军的进犯。上月十五日，该区溱潼县孙家庄、千家庄等处之国民党乡长，率领“自卫队”至解放区边缘地带骚扰，遭当地民兵痛击，经二十分钟激战，缴获步枪四支，其中两支为美造。三分区炳辉县（天长改名）石头区民兵，组织战斗排至前线，曾坚守炳辉南十余里处之三个里头，挡住蒋军猛攻达一天一夜之久。四分区自蒋军侵占整个淮南路西解放区后，当地民兵坚持自卫斗争，曾收复凤阳县之红心辅、小溪河车站及定远县之曹家店等地，缴获枪支数十，消灭蒋军七十余。华中军区对各地人民此种英勇自卫行动，特予传令嘉奖。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Commentator Massey of Moscow Radio commented on the Chinese situation today, pointing out that Chinese reactionaries have launched a nationwide civil war. He said: On August 2nd, the Kuomintang used eight planes obtained from the United States to bomb Yan'an. It is known that the bombs landed near the headquarters of General Zhu De, commander-in-chief of the People's Revolutionary Army, which was the target of the pilots' bombing.\n    Chinese democrats point out that this move by the Kuomintang reactionaries attempts to shatter the Chinese people's hope of establishing peace and preventing civil war in various places. Massey listed facts to prove that this act was premeditated. He pointed out that in the days before the bombing of Yan'an, newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai spread news about the construction of new concentration camps and the implementation of peaceful control. In Shanghai, the state of emergency has been restored and activities against democratic newspapers have begun. In Nanjing, reactionary newspapers launched a frenzied campaign demanding the complete suppression of Communists throughout the country. Under these circumstances, Peng Xuepei, the Kuomintang Minister of Propaganda, directly declared in a speech on July 28th that the country is currently facing a long-term civil war, and the civil war is unfolding very rapidly. On July 30th, Ta Kung Pao reported that a meeting of generals was convened in Guling, attended by Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, and other military leaders. On August 1st, an order for air defense and light control in Nanjing was announced, but the next day (August 2nd), Kuomintang planes bombed Yan'an. Massey continued: Chinese democrats believe that this incident is a stage in the reactionary forces' widespread offensive against democratic forces.\n    Now the Chinese reactionaries have ignited a nationwide civil war. Chinese democrats point out that this is not only a war against the Chinese Communist Party, but also a war against all democratic forces, against Sun Yat-sen's thought and Sun Yat-senism. Massey pointed out: Chinese democrats believe that the bombing of Yan'an and the expansion of the civil war are encouraged and aided by American reactionaries. Chinese democrats believe that the continued presence of U.S. troops in China can only be seen as directly helping the Chinese civil war by standing on the side of Chinese reaction. Massey finally quoted Soong Ching-ling's warning that the Kuomintang cannot win in such a war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努评论中国时局  指出反动派发动全国内战\n\n1946-08-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努评论中国时局  \n    指出反动派发动全国内战\n　　【新华社延安八日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努评论中国时局，指出中国反动分子已发动全国的内战。他说：八月二日国民党以从美国得到的八架飞机轰炸了延安，据悉炸弹落于人民革命军总司令朱德将军总部附近的地方，这就是飞行员轰炸的目标。\n    中国民主人士指出，国民党反动分子此举企图打破中国人民想树立和平与阻止各地内战的希望。马西努列举事实证明这一勾当是预先准备了的。他指出在轰炸延安前几天，南京上海报纸传出关于建筑新的集中营，实施和平控制等消息，在上海已恢复了非常的情况，开始反对民主报纸的活动。在南京反动报纸展开疯狂的运动，要求完全压迫全国各地的共产党员。在这种情况下，国民党宣传部长彭学沛在七月二十八日的演说中，直接宣称目前是处在长期内战的前面，内战已非常迅速的展开了。七月三十日大公报传出在牯岭召集将领会议，有白崇禧、陈诚，及其他军事首领参加。八月一日公布在南京防空与灯火管制的命令，可是第二天（八月二日），国民党飞机就轰炸了延安。马氏继称：中国民主人士认为这个事件是反动势力向民主力量实行广泛的进攻的阶段。\n    现在中国反动分子已燃烧起全国的内战，中国民主人士指出这不仅是反对中国共产党的战争，而且是反对一切的民主力量反对孙中山思想与孙中山主义的战争。马氏指出：中国民主人士认为轰炸延安与内战的扩大乃是美国反动派所鼓励与助长的。中国民主人士认为美军继续驻在中国，只能认为站在中国反动方面直接帮助中国内战。马氏最后引证宋庆龄的警告说：国民党在这种战争中，是不能取得胜利的。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "(With Picture)\n　　How MacArthur Controlled Japan\n    Mo Ye\n\n　　It has been a full year since the Soviet Union declared war, and the Japanese bandits surrendered. The signing ceremony of Japan's surrender was held on the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2 last year. This \"Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof\" empire can be said to have reached \"the setting sun.\" However, international democrats concerned with peace have proposed that they must be vigilant and prevent its \"Fusang resurgence.\" The Potsdam Proclamation and the decisions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference regarding the basic principles for dealing with the Japanese issue are: it is essential to permanently eradicate the militarism that deceives and misleads the Japanese people into their desire to conquer the world, and to establish a responsible and democratic government that is inclined towards peace based on the freely expressed will of the Japanese people.\n\n    Based on this basic principle, examining MacArthur's policies and measures for controlling Japan over the past year, it is evident that they distort and violate the basic principles of the Potsdam Declaration and the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference decisions. To put it more solemnly, it is a kind of sabotage and betrayal. MacArthur not only did not devote himself to thoroughly destroying Japanese militarism and supporting the democratic movement of the Japanese people, but on the contrary, consciously protected and even condoned the revival of Japanese fascist militarism, while suppressing and destroying the democratic movement of the Japanese people to a high degree.\n\n    Facts are the most eloquent witness.\n\n    First, let's take a look at how MacArthur supported the Japanese sham election in April this year. When the Far Eastern Commission discussed the Japanese general election at the end of March, New Zealand representative Berendsen advocated postponing it, arguing that \"in order for left-wing parties to have the opportunity to educate the Japanese people in a democratic spirit, the election should be postponed for at least six months. Democrats are completely unprepared for the campaign, while parties representing the old system are well-organized, financially well-off, and supported by the current government.\" The Soviet representative also agreed with this view, but in the end, due to MacArthur's insistence on opposition and the passage by a majority of the attending representatives, this \"dissent\" was virtually eliminated. In the April election, politicians from the Progressive Party, the Liberal Party, and the Socialist Party used more than 30 million yuan in activity funds provided by the zaibatsu to conduct large-scale bribery, create a large number of puppet organizations, form an anti-democratic front, and launch an anti-communist and anti-democratic movement throughout the country, using threats and inducements, with heavy shadows. MacArthur, who had the power to stop it, turned a blind eye and allowed Japanese monopoly capital and its agents to do whatever they wanted. When Japanese democratic forces and international public opinion condemned and opposed this sham election, MacArthur even issued a statement saying that \"such condemnations will not be allowed.\" Under his vigorous support, about a hundred notoriously fascist militarists became members of parliament, and the reactionary Shidehara government was legalized.\n\n    Although Shidehara has been forced out, his successor, Yoshida, is still a war criminal cabinet representing the interests of the zaibatsu. He had helped the Japanese warlord group invade China, and he had participated in the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Yoshida came to power due to Shidehara's recommendation and with MacArthur's approval, but the broad masses of the Japanese people did not approve of him. In order to demand the establishment of a democratic government and solve the serious food problem, the Japanese people held a mass rally of 250,000 people in front of the Imperial Palace on May 19 and marched in demonstration. At that time, the US military mechanized units near the Imperial Palace removed their gun covers and were ready for battle, suppressing the demonstrators. How \"distinct\" is MacArthur's \"love and hate\" for the reactionary rulers of Japan and the Japanese people who demand democracy and bread!\n\n    Emperor-centrism is the \"unique theory\" of the Japanese fascist movement. The so-called \"clarification of the national polity\" has been the basis of the political programs of many fascist groups. That is to say, the Emperor once existed as the \"living god\" of Japanese militarism, which carried out aggression. Understanding this, it is not difficult to understand why the Japanese bandits still \"attached the condition of maintaining the Emperor as the supreme ruler\" when they finally surrendered; on the other hand, it can be seen how important the insistence of the Japanese Communist Party on abolishing the Emperor system is to completely eradicate the future resurgence of Japanese militarism.\n\n    The American National Lawyers Association once sent a letter to Truman, advocating the arrest of Emperor Hirohito and his trial as a war criminal. The righteousness was awe-inspiring and attracted worldwide attention. However, the chief prosecutor of the Far East International Tribunal publicly stated that the Emperor need not be considered a war criminal and brought to trial. MacArthur's \"care\" for the Emperor can be described as \"meticulous\"!\n\n    This is not inconceivable. MacArthur's intention is to control Japan \"through the Emperor,\" and the Japanese reactionary ruling clique, whose ambition has not died and is plotting a comeback, must preserve the Emperor as a banner for enslaving the people and rebuilding the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\" Therefore, at this moment when the Emperor system is at stake, they unanimously need to affirm the Emperor's position. This common requirement is embodied in the new Japanese constitution drafted by Shidehara and approved by MacArthur. In the Japanese constitution, which is modeled on the Prussian constitution, the Emperor's power is extremely broad. The Emperor is of an unbroken line and is supreme. The political privileges of the Emperor stipulated by the constitution are basically untouched in the new constitution, stipulating that the Emperor is hereditary and considering him \"the symbol of Japanese integration.\" The House of Peers was renamed the House of Councillors, but it is still the same old wine in a new bottle. The so-called House of Councillors is just a new type of House of Peers that reduces the authority of the House of Representatives. Despite the use of some ambiguous and flickering words, it ultimately cannot conceal the reactionary essence of the new constitution, which is to preserve the dictatorship of the zaibatsu landlords and bureaucrats. The Far Eastern Commission issued a statement in May: \"The implementation of the new Japanese constitution must guarantee that the finally promulgated constitution is indeed an expression of the free will of the Japanese people.\" Regarding the issue of reforming the Japanese constitution, MacArthur neither consulted with the Far Eastern Commission nor discussed it with representatives of the Allied powers. Such a unilateral action is completely contrary to the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference.\n\n    Regarding the handling of Japanese war criminals, MacArthur also tried his best to be lenient, repeatedly postponing the trial. The director of the \"Greater East Asia Holy War\" - war criminal Tojo - was even able to eat delicacies and read pictorials sent by air from San Francisco in prison. War criminal Doihara, who is well-known to Chinese women and children, was able to rant and quibble in the Far East International Tribunal, turning the war criminal trial court into a forum for propagating Japanese fascist militarism. Moreover, several zaibatsu who had been included in the list of war criminals, such as Mitsui's Ikeda, Fujiwara, and textile and shipping tycoons Ida, have all been removed from the list of war criminals.\n\n    In addition to supporting the reactionary ruling clique of Japan politically, MacArthur also made every effort to help the revival of the old forces economically. For example, American investment in the textile industry, the supply of American cotton, assistance in silk exports, handing over the merchant fleet to private companies, opposing the Soviet representative's suggestion to revise the Japanese labor law, rejecting the workers' demand for production management rights, and allowing Japanese fishing boats to fish in Chinese territorial waters, all indicate that he is planning for the Japanese zaibatsu. According to a report by a Chicago Sun reporter: \"Professor Edward, during his visit to Japan, drafted a plan advocating the dissolution of the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Yasuda zaibatsu, as well as the monopolistic industries of other zaibatsu, and preventing them from rising again after the end of the United Nations occupation. MacArthur submitted a report to Washington in early July, criticizing Edward's opinion of dissolving the zaibatsu, opposing any drastic measures against the zaibatsu at present, because any directive to deal with the zaibatsu would put the Yoshida cabinet in a difficult situation.\" (⑴⑵)\n\n    At present, the situation of land concentration in Japan remains the same. Taking the Emperor alone, he has 54,000 cho of cultivated land and 1.3 million cho of forest (1 cho is equivalent to more than 10 Chinese mu). Land reform is an indispensable part of the democratization process, which is one of the most important terms of the Allied powers' acceptance of Japan's unconditional surrender. Without land reform, it would not be possible to solve the serious food problem well. When the Allied Council for Japan discussed the issue of Japanese land reform in June, the Soviet representative suggested that the Japanese government confiscate the land of \"absentee landlords\" (that is, parasitic landlords who live in cities indulging in pleasure) and establish a land fund to provide loans to farmers to purchase land from local landlords, stipulating that landlords should not own more than 3 cho of land, and the remaining land should be transferred to farmers with compensation. This fair and reasonable proposal was rejected by the US representative Acheson as \"violating the sacred right to private property\" (?). As a result, the compromise plan of the British representative was adopted - stipulating that the state should buy tenant-cultivated land and sell it to farmers. This plan is just \"drawing cakes to satisfy hunger.\" It is more difficult to implement land reform with it than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.\n\n    Regarding the work of eradicating Japanese fascist militarist ideology, MacArthur also feigned compliance. Although he once issued an order to abolish Shintoism in a seemingly serious manner, when the Soviet representative proposed at the Allied Council for Japan to ban fascist books (especially Hitler's *Mein Kampf*), the US occupation authorities came out to protect the \"freedom of thought and speech\" of Japanese reactionary elements. US Communist leader Foster once said: \"MacArthur is a reactionary with fascist tendencies.\"\n\n    Since the reactionary ruling clique of Japan is so protected, accommodated, supported, and promoted, then the broad masses of the Japanese people who demand democracy must inevitably and in fact have been intimidated, suppressed, attacked, and destroyed. The American army protects the Imperial Palace and the Prime Minister's official residence, not allowing the masses to petition; when the masses carry out hunger marches, the American army will threaten and interfere, with tanks and cavalry dispatched together, removing their gun covers as if facing a formidable enemy. Three days after the large demonstration of 250,000 people in Tokyo on May 18, MacArthur issued a reactionary statement: \"The overt threats now being employed by lawless elements (?) will not be allowed to continue for long. If a minority (?) in Japanese society no longer exercises self-restraint and self-respect, I will have no choice but to take necessary steps to control them.\" On June 18, the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Yoshida Cabinet issued an imperial order saying: \"According to the directive of MacArthur Headquarters on rectifying bad organizations, all political organizations that have not registered with the relevant government agencies will be dissolved.\" The mutual use and collusion between MacArthur and the Emperor can be seen from this.\n\n    Why, after the Japanese bandits attacked Pearl Harbor, did the United States \"share the same hatred\" against Japan, determined to \"destroy this enemy,\" but now that MacArthur has firmly occupied the three islands of Sakura, he can \"not remember the old grievances\" and be so \"magnanimous\" to Japanese war criminals and the entire reactionary ruling clique? The answer to this question is very simple. MacArthur's personal inclinations cannot completely determine the US policy towards Japan. All of MacArthur's measures to control Japan are the concrete manifestations of the US reactionary imperialist group's policy towards Japan. What is the current policy of the American imperialist group towards Japan? In simple terms, it is: to control Japan through the Emperor, to support a comprador government, to suppress the democratic movement of the people, to turn Japan into a US vassal, and to use it as a vanguard and base for anti-Sovietism. According to Brigadier General Thorpe, head of the counterintelligence group at MacArthur Headquarters: \"The Allied occupation must last for up to 20 years to achieve the expected results.\" Its far-sightedness is not difficult to imagine. Only by clearly understanding the strategic intention of the American imperialists can all of MacArthur's measures to control Japan be answered.\n\n    However, subjective wishes are often ridiculed and shattered by developing objective facts. After the First World War, reactionary British rulers such as Chamberlain insisted on the reactionary policy of supporting Germany and suppressing France to oppose the Soviet Union. Later, with the addition of Daladier, they jointly directed a tragedy of Munich, which ultimately led to the defeat of Dunkirk and the fall of France. If it were not for the heroic Soviet Red Army giving the Hitler bandits a powerful blow, the British Isles would probably have raised the \"＠①\" flag long ago. Not only have the reactionary \"appeasers\" reaped their own evil consequences, but also countless millions of peaceful people in Europe and even the world have suffered the scourge of war! Under the \"appeasement policy,\" Germany could produce Hitler. Under MacArthur's policy towards Japan, is it impossible to produce a second Tojo? The American authorities should remember this painful historical lesson.\n\n    Although the inevitable collapse of Japanese fascist imperialism is a historical destiny, it announced its surrender only two days after the Soviet Union sent troops, and did not make every effort to make a \"last-ditch fight\" to prolong its life. This originally contained a huge conspiracy. This conspiracy is to retain some strength and prepare to take the opportunity to rise again. The reactionary forces in Japan were indeed panicked at the beginning of the surrender because they did not know what kind of fate they would suffer under American control. After seeing the intentions of the United States, they calmed down and increased their confidence. Konoe has contributed greatly to this transformation. From Shidehara to Yoshida, they all adopted Konoe's political line, which is to \"falsely cooperate\" with MacArthur, deliberately showing obedience, using MacArthur's use of them while using MacArthur; on the other hand, \"disintegrating into parts\" and \"secretly advancing troops from Chencang.\" This war did not reach the Japanese mainland, and the damage to Japanese production institutions and industrial equipment is far less than what the newspapers and magazines publicized and exaggerated. American Pauley recently went to Japan for inspection. According to his statistics, the Japanese textile industry can now start operating immediately and can reach one-fifth of its pre-war level. All other industrial equipment can have a production volume of one-quarter of its pre-war level. It is already considerable to have recovered to such an extent in less than a year, not to mention that a large amount of wealth, munitions, and means of production must have been hidden. As for the various underground conspiracy activities of the Japanese fascist militarist forces, it is also an open secret. At the Allied Council for Japan, US officials had to admit that \"this is a fact.\" Under the guise of democracy, many \"extremely patriotic\" political parties and social groups have been established one after another. Recently, Omura, the Minister of Home Affairs of the Yoshida Cabinet, declared in the parliament: \"15 million yuan will be used in the government budget to expand the police force and improve the treatment of the police.\" Omura admitted that the current number of police is greater than that of the occupation forces, but he still insisted that the police organization must be expanded. At the same time, it has recently been discovered in various parts of Japan that some schools are implementing compulsory military training. The ambition of Japanese fascist militarism to \"make a comeback\" is as clear as fire.\n\n    The greater the pressure, the greater the resistance. Despite the fact that MacArthur and the reactionary ruling clique of Japan are working together to put high pressure on the Japanese democratic movement, the broad masses of the Japanese people who are fighting for democracy and food, under the leadership of the democratic front with the Japanese Communist Party as the backbone, are fighting unyieldingly. Since May, a series of marches and demonstrations have fully demonstrated the strength and growth of the democratic forces of the Japanese people. The labor group organized by the Japanese Socialist Party - the General Federation of Labor - has recently expanded into a national organization with a total membership of 855,000 people due to the participation and leadership of the party's left-wing leader Kanji Kato and others, accepting the Japanese Communist Party's proposal to establish a unified labor front. This is not only a new milestone in the history of the Japanese labor movement, but also a signal that the current Japanese democratic movement will therefore become increasingly high! In the future, the struggle between democracy and anti-democracy in Japan will inevitably become increasingly acute, and the struggle tasks of the Japanese people are very complex and arduous. But it is certain that those who will ultimately determine the fate of Japan will not be the reactionary MacArthur, Hirohito, Shidehara, and Yoshida, but the Japanese people themselves!\n\n

漠野\n　　苏联宣战，日寇投降，转眼是整整一年了。去年九月二日在东京湾的密苏里旗舰上举行了日本投降的签字典礼，这个“八弦一宇”的帝国可谓“日落崦嵫”了，然而，关心和平的国际民主人士们却曾提出必须警惕与防范其“扶桑再起”。波茨顿会议的公告，莫斯科三强外长会议的决议，关于处理日本问题的基本原则，就是：必须永久铲除欺骗及错误领导日本人民使其妄欲征服世界的军国主义，依据日本人民自由表示的意志成立一个倾向和平的负责的民主政府。\n    根据这个基本原则，来检验一下麦克阿瑟一年来的对日管制政策及其措施，显而易见的是歪曲与违反了波茨顿宣言与莫斯科外长会议决定的基本原则，说得更郑重一点，就是一种破坏与背叛。麦克阿瑟不但没有致力于彻底摧毁日本军国主义，赞助日本人民的民主运动，相反的是意识的地庇护甚至纵容着日本法西斯军国主义的复活，而对于日本人民的民主运动却加以高度的抑制与摧残。\n    事实是最雄辩的见证者。\n    首先，看一看麦克阿瑟是怎样支持了今年四月间的日本伪选。在三月底远东委员会讨论日本大选问题的时候，纽西兰代表贝伦特逊曾主张从缓举行，他认为：“为使左翼各党得有机会以民主精神教育日本人民起见，选举至少须展期六个月。民主份子对于竞选毫无准备，而代表旧制度的政党则组织良好，经济充足，并得现政府之支持”，苏联代表也同意这个意见，但结果终于因麦克阿瑟的坚持反对和出席代表多数的通过，这个“异议”无形打消了。在四月的大选中，进步党、自由党、与社会党的政客们，借财阀供给的三千多万元活动费，大规模进行贿选，大批制造御用团体，结成反民主阵线，在全国各地展开反共反民主运动，威胁利诱，黑幕重重；而具有权力予以制止的麦帅竟熟视无睹，放任日本独占资本及其代理人为所欲为。当日本民主力量与国际舆论纷纷谴责与反对这个伪选的时候，麦克阿瑟竟然发表谈话，说“决不允许发生这种谴责”。在他这样的大力支持之下，一百个左右的劣迹昭著的法西斯军国主义分子当了议员，而反动的币原政府也就得以合法化了。\n    币原虽然已经被迫滚蛋了，但继之而起的吉田，却仍然是一个代表财阀利益的战犯内阁。他曾帮助过日本军阀集团侵略中国，他曾参加了反共公约的签订。吉田登台是由于币原的推荐，经过了麦克阿瑟的批准，可是，广大的日本人民是并没有批准他的。日本人民为了要求建立民主政府和解决严重的粮食问题，于五月十九日在日皇宫前举行了二十五万人的群众大会，并游行示威，当时皇宫附近的美军机械化部队，卸去炮衣，如临大敌，对示威群众予以镇压。麦帅对于日本反动的统治者和要求民主与面包的日本人民，是多么“爱憎分明”呵！\n    天皇中心主义，是日本法西斯运动的“独特的理论”，所谓“国体明征”，曾为许多法西斯团体政治纲领的基本。这就是说，天皇是曾经作为侵略的日本军国主义之“活的神灵”而存在的。明乎此，就不难了解为什么日寇当最后乞降的时候还要“附有保持天皇为最高统治者之条件”；另一方面，也就可以看出日本共产党之所以坚持主张废除天皇制，是如何重大地攸关着彻底根绝日本军国主义今后的再起。\n    美国全国律师协会曾经致函杜鲁门，主张逮捕日皇裕仁，并以战犯付审。义正词严，举世瞩目。可是，远东国际法庭首席检查官却公开声明，天皇不必视同战犯到庭受审。麦帅之于天皇，可谓“爱护备至”矣！\n    这是并非不可思议的，麦克阿瑟的意图是“通过天皇”控制日本，而野心未死图谋卷土重来的日本反动统治集团，更须保存天皇作为奴役人民与再建“大东亚帝国”的旗帜，从而，在目前这个天皇制度安危所系的当儿，他们便一致地需要将天皇的地位予以肯定，这个共同的要求，在币原起草业经麦克阿瑟批准的日本新宪法中体现出来了。在以普鲁士宪法为蓝本的日本宪法中，天皇的权力是极为广大的，天皇是万世一系的，是至尊无上的。被宪法所规定的天皇的政治特权，在新宪法中基本上是原封未动，明定天皇世袭，并认为“日本统合的象征”。贵族院改名为参议院，换汤不换药，所谓参议院只不过是缩小众议院权限的新式贵族院而已。尽管运用一些暧昧闪烁的词句，但终于掩盖不了新宪法之反动的实质，它的实质就是保存财阀地主和官僚的专政。远东委员会于五月间曾发表声明：“规定日本新宪法之施行，必须能保证最后颁布之宪法确系日本人民自由意志的表现。”关于改革日本宪法的问题，麦克阿瑟既未同远东委员会磋商，也没有与盟国代表研讨，这样一意孤行，是完全违背了莫斯科外长会议之决议的。\n    关于日本战犯的处理，麦克阿瑟亦系尽优容之能事，一再延期审判。“大东亚圣战”的导演者--战犯东条，在监狱中居然得能饱食珍馐，阅览的画报都是由旧金山航寄来的。中国妇孺皆知的战犯土肥原，竟能在远东国际法庭格猖狂狡辩，将审讯战犯的法庭当作了宣传大和法西斯军国主义的讲坛。并且，若干已被列入战犯名单中的财阀如三井的池田、藤原，纺织业航业的巨子井田等等，均已从战犯名单中被剔出来了。\n    麦克阿瑟除了在政治上支持日本反动的统治集团以外，在经济方面亦复竭力帮助着旧势力的复活。例如对纺织业的美国投资，美棉的供给，生丝出口的协助，将商船队交给私营公司，反对苏联代表修改日本劳工法的建议，否决工人生产管理权的要求，还有让日本渔船在中国领海捕鱼等等，无一不是表示他在为日本的财阀们打算。顷据芝加哥太阳报记者报导：“爱德华教授于访问日本的期间，曾草拟了一个计划，主张解散三井、三菱、住友、安田四大财阀，以及其他财阀的独占性工业，并防其在联合国占领工作结束之后再行抬头。麦克阿瑟于七月初向华盛顿提出一个报告，批评爱德华解散财阀的意见，反对在目前对财阀采取任何激烈之措施，因任何对付财阀之指令，将使吉田内阁处于困境。”（⑴⑵）\n    目前日本土地集中的情形，依然如故，单拿天皇一个人来说，他就有熟田五万四千町，森林一百卅万町（一町合华亩十亩多）。土地改革是盟国接受日本无条件投降的最重要条款之一的民主化程序中不可缺少的一部份，而且没有土地改革，也就不可能很好的解决严重的粮食问题。盟国对日委员会于六月间讨论日本土地改革问题的时候，苏联代表建议要日本政府没收“不在地主”（即住在都市纵欲享乐的寄生地主）的土地。和建立土地基金，以便贷款给农民购置在乡地主的土地。规定地主拥有土地不得超过三町步，其余土地有代价的交给农民。这个公平合理的建议，竟被美代表艾契森认为是“侵犯神圣的私有财产权”（？）而被否决了。结果是通过了英代表的折衷方案--规定由国家收买佃耕的土地，并卖给农民。这个方案只不过是“画饼充饥”而已，以之实行土地改革，那是比骆驼穿过针眼还要难的。\n    关于肃清日本法西斯军国主义思想的工作，麦克阿瑟也是阳奉阴违，他虽然也曾像煞有介事的下令废除神道教，但当苏联代表在盟国对日委员会上提议禁绝法西斯书籍（特别是希特勒的《我的奋斗》）的时候，美国占领当局便出来要保护日本反动分子的“思想与言论自由”了。美共领袖福斯特曾经说过：“麦克阿瑟是有法西斯倾向的反动分子”呵。\n    对于日本的反动统治集团既然是如此的庇护、优容、支持、与助长，那么，对于要求民主的日本广大人民，也就必然而且事实上已经是加以恫吓、镇压、打击，与摧残，美国军队保卫着日皇皇宫及首相官邸，不让群众前去请愿；当群众作饥饿游行的时候，美军便予以威胁干涉，坦克骑兵一齐出动，卸去炮衣如临大敌。五月十八日东京二十五万人大示威以后的第三天，麦克阿瑟就发表一个反动的声明：“目无法纪分子（？）现在开始采用之有形威胁行为，不许其长此继续。如果日本社会少数分子（？）不再自制自重，我将不得不采必要步骤加以管制。”吉田内阁内务省于六月十八日颁布日皇命令说：“根据麦克阿瑟总部关于整顿不良组织的指令，凡一切未在相当政府机关登记的政治组织将被解散。”麦帅与天皇之相互利用，狼狈为奸，于此可见一斑。\n    为什么在日寇偷袭珍珠港以后，美国对日“同仇敌忾”，势必“灭此朝食”，而当麦克阿瑟已然雄踞了樱花三岛的今天，却能“不念旧恶”对日本战犯以及整个的反动统治集团如此的“宽大”呢？这个问题的解答，是非常简单的。麦克阿瑟个人的倾向，并不能完全决定美国的对日政策，麦克阿瑟管制日本的一切措施，也就是美国反动的帝国主义集团之对日政策的具体表现。当前美国帝国主义集团的对日政策是什么呢？简单一句话就是：通过天皇控制日本，扶植一个买办性的政府、压制人民的民主运动，变日本为美国的附庸，并以之作为反苏的先锋与基地。据麦克阿瑟总部反间组组长索普准将的估计：“盟军占领时日得持续至二十年始能获得预期的收获。”其深谋远虑，是不难想见的。也只有明确地洞悉了美国帝国主义者这个战略的意图，麦克阿瑟对日管制的一切措施才能够得到解答。\n    然而，主观的愿望，往往为发展着的客观事实所嘲弄与粉碎。在第一次大战以后，反动的英国统治者如张伯伦之流，坚持扶德抑法以反苏的反动政策，后来加上了一个达拉第，共同导演了一幕慕尼黑的悲剧，到头来是顿克尔刻的溃败，法国的沦亡，倘使没有英勇的苏联红军予希特勒匪徒以强有力的打击，则英伦三岛恐亦早已悬起“＠①”字旗了。不仅是反动的“绥靖主义”者们已自食其恶果，而且使欧洲乃至全世界无数千万的和平人民遭受了战争的浩劫！在“绥靖政策”之下，德国既可产生希特勒，在麦克阿瑟的对日政策之下，难道就不可能产生东条第二吗？这个苦痛的历史教训，美国当局是应当记取的。\n    虽然日本法西斯帝国主义之必然溃灭是一个历史的宿命，但是，苏联出兵两天，它就宣布投降，并未尽最后一切努力以作“困兽之斗”而苟延时日，这其间原来是包含着一个巨大阴谋的。这个阴谋就是保留一点力量，准备乘机而再起。日本的反动势力在投降之初，确曾一度恐慌，因为不晓得在美国管制下将遭受到怎样的命运。后来看出了美国的用心，方才安定了下来，并且提高了自信。这一转变，近卫与有力焉。自币原以至吉田都是采取近卫的政治路线，就是一方面对麦克阿瑟“虚与委蛇”，故示恭顺，利用麦克阿瑟对他们的利用而利用麦克阿瑟；一方面“化整为零”，“陈仓暗渡”。这次的战争并没有打到日本本土，日本生产机构工业设备之破坏远不如报章杂志宣传渲染之甚。美国鲍莱最近赴日考察，据他统计日本纺织工业现在立刻可开工的可及战前的五分之一，一切其他工业设备可有战前四分之一的生产量，不到一年已恢复到如此程度，已属可观，更何况一定还有大量的资财、军火、与生产手段被隐藏起来了呢。至于日本法西斯军国主义力量之各种地下的阴谋活动，也是公开的秘密，在盟国对日委员会上，美方官员也不得不承认“有此事实”。在民主的伪装之下，许多“极端爱国主义”的政党与社团都相继成立起来了。最近吉田内阁内务大臣大村在议会中宣称：“政府预算中，有一千五百万元将用来扩充警察和改善警察的待遇。”大村承认目前警察数目大于占领军，但他仍主张非扩充警察组织不可。同时，在日本各地最近发现有若干学校实行强迫军训。日本法西斯军国主义之“卷土重来”的野心，是了如观火呵。\n    压力大反抗力愈大。尽管麦克阿瑟与日本的反动统治集团协同地予日本民主运动以高压，然而，为民主与粮食而斗争的日本广大人民，在以日共为主干的民主阵线的领导之下，不屈不挠地战斗着自五月以来，一连串的游行示威，充分地显示了日本人民之民主力量的强大与生长。日本社会党所组织的职工团体--劳动总同盟，最近由于该党左翼领袖加藤勘十等参加领导，接受了日共建立职工统一战线的建议，扩大为全国性的组织，会员总数已增至八十五万五千人了。这不但是日本职工运动史上的一个新的里程碑，同时，也是目前日本民主运动之行将因此而愈益高涨的信号！今后日本民主与反民主的斗争必然会日趋尖锐，日本人民的斗争任务是非常复杂而艰巨的。但可确信，最后决定日本命运的将不是反动的麦克阿瑟、裕仁、币原、吉田之流，而是日本人民自己！\n

    "content": "【Linzhang News from this newspaper】Coordinating with the Kuomintang reactionaries' military offensive, the Anyang National Special Agents, combined with the traitor Guo Qing, Wang Ziquan and other plainclothes special agent bandits, frequently crossed the Zhang River, lurking in the border areas of Linzhang, carrying out sabotage activities such as looting, assassination, kidnapping, and extortion. Under the slogan of \"Preventing Bandits and Defending Themselves\" issued by our democratic government, the masses in various districts of the Third and Fifth Districts have organized militia to arm themselves for self-defense. In the riverine areas, the militia actively operated to protect the masses' wheat harvest and oppose the plainclothes teams' demands for payment and extortion, which won the support of the masses. In various areas of the First and Third Districts, mobilizing the masses was closely integrated with armed struggle against the enemy, directly protecting the fruits of the masses' emancipation. The local militia joint defense and joint security system has begun to be established, restricting the activities of plainclothes bandits.\n    However, in some villages, the armed forces were divorced from the mass struggle, and the militia was controlled by local bullies and landlords and a few hooligans. Special agents used threats and inducements to buy off militia cadres, disintegrate the militia, and surrender to the enemy. In the riverine villages of the Fifth District, traitorous landlords colluded with Guo Qing's plainclothes agents, staging a militia rebellion conspiracy, which has aroused serious vigilance among our military and civilians. On July 4th and 5th, the plainclothes teams were repeatedly intercepted by our militia joint defense teams when they crossed the river. The struggle against the enemy in the border areas is becoming increasingly tense. The county headquarters is drawing up a joint defense force of the militia, establishing unified command, and taking advantage of the rising water of the Zhang River to actively eliminate and combat plainclothes special agent activities.\n    According to what this reporter has learned: the people of Linzhang are brave and have experience in the struggle against Guo Qing. In the future, in the struggle against stubborn and puppet special agents, we should further grasp the universal demand of the masses to oppose traitors and enemies and oppose extortion, and mobilize the masses to arm themselves for self-defense. We should combine the mobilization of the masses with the armed self-defense struggle, and transform the armed forces in the struggle, and strengthen the unified command of the Party, government, army and people, so as to achieve the goal of protecting the masses' emancipation and supporting the front.\n    (Bing Ru)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 临漳边地斗争紧张群众武装保卫翻身\n冰如\n1946-08-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　临漳边地斗争紧张群众武装保卫翻身\n　　【本报临漳讯】配合国民党反动派的军事进攻，安阳国特结合汉奸郭清、王自全等部便衣特务土匪，经常偷渡漳河，潜伏临漳边地，进行抢劫、暗杀绑、票勒索等破坏活动，三五区各地群众在我民主政府“防匪自卫”口号下，纷纷组织民兵武装自卫。在沿河地区，民兵积极活动，保卫群众麦收，反对便衣队催款勒索，得到了群众的拥护。一三区各地，发动群众与武装对敌斗争紧密结合，直接保护了群众翻身成果。各地民兵联防和联环保制度开始成立，限制了便衣土匪活动。\n    但有的村庄，武装与发动群众斗争脱节，民兵为恶霸地主与少数流氓分子掌握。特务分子以威胁利诱方式，收买民兵干部，瓦解民兵投敌。五区沿河村庄汉奸地主勾结郭清便衣，串演民兵叛变阴谋，已引起我军民严重警惕。七月四五两日便衣队渡河时，曾接连遭我民兵联防队阻击，边沿地区对敌斗争，日趋紧张。县指挥部正抽组民兵联防武装，建立统一指挥，乘漳河水涨之际，积极清剿打击便衣特务活动。\n    据记者所悉：临漳民性强悍，具有反郭清斗争经验，今后在对顽伪特务斗争中，应更抓紧群众反资敌反勒索的普遍要求，发动群众武装自卫。把发动群众与武装自卫斗争结合起来，并在斗争中改造武装，加强党政军民的统一指挥，以便达成保卫群众翻身，支援前线之目的。  \n    （冰如）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th: Beiping Dispatch: The 25th Special Group dispatched by the Beiping Executive Headquarters to Anping to investigate the clash between American and Chiang's troops and the Communist troops, departed yesterday (8th) at 2:30 PM. Due to the continuous provocations by the U.S. Marines, the U.S. side, which had always been in a mediating position, is now standing on the side of the Chiang faction, becoming the initiator, or at least a party involved, in the military conflict. The 25th Special Group experienced unbelievable chaos. Despite the U.S. Marines in Tianjin issuing various anti-Communist propaganda and receiving all possible assistance from the Kuomintang side, strangely, these self-proclaimed \"attacked victims\" were all delaying the departure of the Special Group. Only the Communists actively demanded a prompt investigation. The Kuomintang's Central News Agency declared as early as the 3rd that the group had already departed, but in reality, until the 5th, the Kuomintang representative still demanded, without any reason, the replacement of the Communist representative, until even the U.S. representative, who was conspiring to delay, could not agree with the Kuomintang representative's absurd attitude. However, in any case, the Kuomintang representative thus achieved the purpose of delaying for an entire day. On the 6th, the U.S. side again took the place of the Kuomintang to demand continued delay. The U.S. side demanded that the group depart on the 8th. General Ye Jianying, the Communist member of the Executive Headquarters, submitted a memorandum to the U.S. and Kuomintang sides, believing that the 8th was too late and demanding an earlier departure. The U.S. representative, who was deliberately delaying, refused General Ye's protest and openly refused, in the meeting on the 7th, the group's investigation of the Tianjin U.S. military headquarters, the perpetrator of the incident, attempting to force the group to listen to reports from witnesses designated by the U.S. side itself. By the 8th, the U.S. representative of the group continued to argue with the Communist representative, even demanding the replacement of the representative in order to continue delaying the investigation. The group finally departed at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, which was already the tenth day after the Anping incident. The three members of the Executive Headquarters decided that the Kuomintang, the U.S., and the Communist sides would each send two reporters to accompany the group and be allowed to attend group meetings as observers. At the same time, it was decided to send a group to the Anping-Xianghe area to investigate the new offensive by the U.S. and Chiang's troops against the Communists. The public opinion in Beiping and Tianjin paid attention to the delay by the U.S. and Chiang's sides, which was related to their military actions of occupying the incident site and expanding the occupied area after the conflict occurred. It is generally believed that the first purpose of the delay was to gain time to eliminate and fabricate evidence. Public opinion expressed great surprise at the U.S. side's complete abandonment of its neutral position and the Kuomintang side's complete abandonment of its national stance.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀东安平镇事件发生后  美蒋合谋拖延调处  平津舆论界咸表惊异\n\n1946-08-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀东安平镇事件发生后            \n    美蒋合谋拖延调处         \n    平津舆论界咸表惊异\n    【新华社张家口九日电】北平讯：北平执行部派往安平调查美蒋军进攻中共军冲突经过的第二十五特别小组，昨日（八日）下午二时半已出发。由于美国海军陆战队的不断挑衅，已经使向来处在调解地位的美方，现在与蒋方站在一边，成为军事冲突的发起人，至少是军事冲突的当事人。二十五特别小组发生了难以相信的混乱，尽管天津美国海军陆战队方面发出各种反对中共的宣传，并得到了国民党方面的一切可能的援助，但奇异的是这些自称的“被袭击者”，都尽是拖延特别小组的出发，积极要求迅速调查的只有中共。国民党的中央社，在三日就宣称小组已经出发，但实际上直到五日，国民党代表还毫无理由的要求撤换中共代表，直至同谋拖延的美方代表也不能同意国民党代表的荒谬态度。但无论如何，国民党代表因此达到了拖延一整天的目的。六日，美方又代替国民党的地位要求继续拖延，美方要求小组八日出发，执行部中共委员叶剑英将军则向美方与国民党方面提出备忘录，认为八日太迟，要求提早，有计划拖延的美国代表拒绝叶将军的抗议，并在七日的会议中公然拒绝小组向肇事者的天津美军司令部调查，企图强制小组听美方自行指定的见证人报告。到了八日，小组美方代表继续与中共代表争吵，甚至也要求撤换代表，以便继续拖延调查。小组延至八日下午二时半终于出发，这已是安平事件发生后的第十天，执行部三委员决定国民党方面、美国方面和中共方面各派两个记者随同小组出发，并得列席小组会议旁听，同时决定派一分组到安平香河地区调查美军和蒋军对于中共的新进攻。平津舆论界注意美方和蒋方的拖延，是与他们在冲突发生后占领出事地点，并扩张占领区的军事行动相关联的。一般相信拖延的第一个目的，是赢得消灭证据和伪造证据的时间。舆论界对美方完全抛弃中立立场，和国民党方面完全抛弃民族立场，表示极大的惊奇。"

    "content": "A Bird's-Eye View of Taiyue Culture and Education\n　　With the development of the Taiyue area and the deepening of the mass emancipation movement, the cultural movement in the Taiyue area has greatly developed in the past year. The emerging culture of the masses themselves has begun and is seizing the position of feudal culture, and the face of the countryside has gradually changed.\n    (1) Newspapers: The circulation of the Taiyue Xinhua Daily has increased from 7,000 to 11,000 copies in the past year, of which nearly 60% are distributed to districts and villages. There are 3,200 administrative villages in the entire district, with an average of two copies of the Xinhua Daily per village. There are 2,100 newspaper reading groups in the district, and they adopt the method of mutual teaching and learning to collectively study the newspapers. Because the newspaper is more closely integrated with reality and promotes work (such as the newsletter about the emancipation of Tianshuiling, which has been discussed throughout the district and promoted the further development of the mass movement), the masses also cherish their own newspaper more. At the same time, small newspapers throughout the district have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain in the past year. Almost every county has a regular or irregular small newspaper. These are popular newspapers that reflect the struggle life of the masses, so they can gradually take root among village cadres and the masses.\n    In addition, a total of 1,759 blackboards have been established in the district (that is, more than half of the administrative villages have blackboards). It is not only a \"red list\" for commending models and a \"command platform\" for promoting work, but also a question and answer office for the masses and a learning garden for the masses.\n    (2) Publishing Industry: In the past year, the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore has published and distributed a total of 324,526 copies of various books and magazines, with an average of one new book for every ten people in the district. Among them, 210,000 copies are mass reading materials, accounting for two-thirds of the total publications, and \"Rural Applied Writing,\" \"Daily Magazine,\" and \"Literacy Textbook\" sell best, with each selling 10,000 to 20,000 copies. Among the cadres' reading materials, \"On the Coalition Government\" is the most widely sold.\n    Regular publications include the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Monthly, New Literature and Art Monthly, New Education Monthly, Digest Monthly, Economic Monthly, and Taiyue Political Report, each with a circulation of 3,000 to 7,000 copies. In addition, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sub-districts all have small lithographic printing factories. The 1st and 2nd sub-districts can each print 5,000 books per month, and the 4th sub-district can print 20,000 books per month.\n    However, due to the increasing needs of the masses, the publishing industry is still in short supply. We are now trying to continue to expand it.\n    (3) School Education: School education has greatly developed in the past year. There are currently 5,120 elementary schools, with an average of 1.6 per administrative village, an increase of 66% compared with 3,000 a year ago. The number of children enrolled in school is 200,000, an increase of 66% compared with 120,000 a year ago. There are currently 138 higher elementary schools, an increase of 70% compared with 80 a year ago. There are currently 13,277 students, an increase of 160% compared with 500 a year ago. There are a total of 300,000 school-age children in the district, and the number of children enrolled in school accounts for two-thirds of all school-age children.\n    There are currently six middle schools in the district, an increase of two compared with a year ago. There are currently 900 students, an increase of nearly one time compared with 480 a year ago.\n    The development of school education in the past year has the following characteristics:\n    First, it is gradually developing in the direction of public assistance through private management. There are currently 441 private elementary schools in the district. Due to the urgent demand for children to attend school after the masses have been emancipated, or through parent meetings, or promoted by labor heroes, or promoted by model teachers, they are moving in the direction of public assistance through private management. Especially in sparsely populated areas, privately run schools are increasing day by day.\n    Second, the new education policy has been implemented, the content of teaching has been changed, and whatever the masses need is taught. Generally, schools have added courses such as abacus calculation, bookkeeping, writing contracts, and opening road passes.\n    Third, learning is combined with production, so a large number of out-of-school children are organized to study, and many cowherds and other poor children are organized to work and study part-time. Flexible production leave and half-day or every-other-day systems are also implemented for children in school to take care of children's family production.\n    Fourth, cooperate with the central work to serve the society. For example, Li Guangjian, a model teacher in Hongtong, used the school as the center to promote production, preferential treatment for resistance against Japan, and returning to school, and transformed a backward village into a model village.\n    Fifth, the number of women enrolled in school has increased. Generally, girls in schools account for one-third to one-half. There are also eight part-time women's textile schools in the district.\n    (4) Rural Drama Movement Under the slogan of \"mass emancipation, self-entertainment and self-singing,\" the rural drama movement in the Taiyue area has been unprecedentedly universally launched, and many drama troupes that are famous throughout the district have emerged. There are currently 722 rural drama troupes in the district, with 13,719 actors, 2,191 Yangko teams with 100,000 actors, and 19 drum book teams, with almost every administrative village having a mass entertainment organization. These drama troupes were mostly established during the mass emancipation movement, and they have powerfully cooperated in promoting the mass movement against traitors, evil gentry, rent reduction and debt clearing. Therefore, the rural drama movement has played an unparalleled role in promoting the peasant emancipation movement, and the vivid facts of the mass emancipation movement have provided unlimited valuable materials for the drama movement.\n    The above is a bird's-eye view of the cultural movement in the Taiyue area in the past year. It has now been decided to hold a district-wide cultural work conference on August 15 to summarize past experience, determine future tasks, and establish a leading organization of the cultural circles in the district, preparing to launch a large-scale mass cultural movement this winter.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳文教鸟瞰\n\n1946-08-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳文教鸟瞰\n　　随着太岳区局面的开展，群众翻身运动的深入，一年来太岳区的文化运动已大大发展，新兴的群众自己的文化已开始并正在夺取封建文化的阵地，农村的面貌已逐渐改观。\n    （一）报纸：太岳新华日报一年来由七千份增至一万一千份，其中将近百分之六十发行到区村。全区三千二百个行政村。每村平均有两份新华日报。全区有二千一百个读报组，他们采取互教互学的办法集体学习报纸。由于报纸更加结合实际，推动了工作（如天水岭翻身记的通讯，已在全区范围内展开讨论，推动了群众运动进一步深入开展）。因之群众也更加爱护自己的报纸。同时全区的小型报纸，一年来如雨后春笋般的产生，差不多每个县都有一个定期的或不定期的小报。这些都是反映群众斗争生活的通俗报，故能在村干部及群众中逐渐生根。\n    另外全区共建立了一七五九块黑板报（即过半数的行政村有黑板报），它不仅是表扬模范的“红榜”，是推动工作的“点将台”，而且是群众的问事处，是群众的学习园地。\n    （二）出版事业：太岳新华书店一年来出版及发行各种图书杂志共三十二万四千五百二十六册，平均全区每十个人有一本新书。其中群众读物二十一万册，占全部出版量三分之二，而以“农村应用文”“日用杂志”“识字课本”销路最好，每种销行一万至二万份。干部读物中以“论联合政府”为销行最广者。\n    定期刊物现有工农兵月刊、新文艺月刊、新教育月刊、文摘月刊、经济月刊、太岳政报等种，每种发行三千至七千份。另外一、二、三、四分区都有小型的石印工厂，一、二分区每月各能印书五千册，四分区每月能印二万册。\n    但由于群众需要增加，目前出版事业还是供不应求。现正设法继续扩大之。\n    （三）学校教育：一年来的学校教育有很大发展，现有初小五一二○处，每个行政村平均有一·六处，较一年前的三千处增加百分之六十六。入学儿童二十万，较一年前的十二万亦增加百分之六十六。高小现有一三八所，较一年前的八十所增加百分之七十。学生现有一三二七七人，较一年前的五百人增加百分之一百六十。全区共有学龄儿童三十万，入学儿童占全部学龄儿童的三分之二。\n    全区现有中学六所，较一年前增加两所。现有学生九百人，较一年前的四百八十人增加将近一倍。\n    一年来学校教育的发展有这样几个特点：\n    第一是逐渐向民办公助方向发展。现全区已有民办小学四百四十一处。由于群众翻身后要求子弟入学的迫切，或通过家长会议，或由劳动英雄的提倡，或由模范教员的推动而走向民办公助的方向。尤其是在人烟稀少的地区民办的学校正日益增加。\n    第二是执行了新的教育方针，改变了教学的内容，作到群众需要啥就教啥。一般学校都增加了珠算、记账、写契约、开路条等课程。\n    第三是学习与生产结合，从而组织了广大的校外儿童读书，将许多放牛娃及其他贫苦儿童组织起来半工半读。对校内儿童亦灵活实解放生产假，半日内隔日制，以照顾儿童家庭生产。\n    第四是配合中心工作为社会服务。如洪洞模范教员李光艰以学校为中心，推动了生产、优抗、回学等工作，变落后村为模范村。\n    第五是妇女入学的增多。一般学校的女生占三分之一到二分之一。全区还有八个半工半读的妇女纺织学校。\n    （四）农村剧运在“群众翻身，自乐自唱”的口号下，太岳区的农村戏剧运动空前普遍开展，并已出现许多誉满全区的剧团。现全区共有农村剧团七二二个，演员一三七一九人，有秧歌队二一九一队，演员达十万人，有鼓书队十九队，将近每一个行政村有一个群众的娱乐组织。这些剧团大都是在群众翻身运动中建立的，它有力的配合推动了反奸反恶霸及减租清债的群众运动。因之农村剧运对农民翻身运动起了不可比拟的推动作用，而群众翻身运动生动的事实，又给剧运提供了无限的宝贵材料。\n    以上便是太岳区一年来文化运动的鸟瞰。现已决定于八月十五日开全区文化工作会议，总结过去经验，确定今后的任务，并建立全区的文化界领导机构，准备展开今冬大规模的群众文化运动。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. \"The Red Army has made a great contribution to accelerating Japan's surrender and defeat.\" This was the comment made by Soviet Colonel Voronin on Moscow Radio on the eighth, the first anniversary of the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan. Voronin first stated: Without the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan, it would be difficult to predict when the Pacific War would end. At that time, it was estimated that the Pacific War would continue until 1946, and according to the US military command's plan, it was not intended to capture the Japanese mainland until the autumn of 1946. Even if Japan lost its overseas island bases and the Japanese naval fleet, Japan could still continue to fight in its own country and could still maintain its powerful bases in Manchuria and Korea, where it could continue to counterattack. To defeat this strong resistance would require great efforts and a long struggle from the British and Americans. At the same time, the main forces of the British and Americans were still in Europe, and only after these troops were transported to the East could they participate in the struggle for Manchuria and Korea. After the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan, it crushed the Japanese Kwantung Army and liberated the people of Manchuria and Korea who had suffered so much. The Red Army's continued offensive provided direct assistance to the Chinese people who had suffered so much in the war. Voronin pointed out that during the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, the Soviet Union had contained a million elite Japanese troops in Manchuria and Korea, making it impossible for Japan to transport these troops to fight against the Chinese people and against the United States and Britain. The Red Army crushed this powerful army, causing Japanese imperialism to continue to collapse, thus greatly accelerating Japan's surrender. Voronin concluded by saying: In this way, the Red Army's powerful offensive against Japan's strategic defense supplemented the British, American, and Chinese strikes against the Japanese army and navy, and became the final and decisive blow. This major blow changed the military and political situation in the Pacific, accelerated the elimination of the source of war in the Far East, and thus created the possibility of universal peace.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太平洋战争能迅速结束红军参战具有决定意义  莫斯科广播评苏联对日宣战一周年\n\n1946-08-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太平洋战争能迅速结束红军参战具有决定意义     \n    莫斯科广播评苏联对日宣战一周年\n    【新华社延安九日电】“红军对加速日本投降与失败有重大的功勋”，这是莫斯科广播苏联渥伦尼上校八日在苏联对日宣战一年周年时发表的评论。渥氏首称：如果没有苏联参加对日战争，太平洋战争究竟什么时候结束，是困难预料的。当时估计太平洋战争要继续到一九四六年，而且按照美军指挥部的计划，在一九四六年秋始打算攻克日本本岛。纵使日本丧失了海外的岛屿根据地及日本海军舰队，但日本还能在本国继续战斗，而且仍能保持其强大的满洲与朝鲜根据地，在那里继续反攻。要击破这种坚强的反抗，需要英美很大的努力与长期的斗争。同时，英美的主力仍在欧洲，只有这些军队运到东方之后，始能参加争夺满洲与朝鲜的斗争。苏联加入反日战争后，粉碎了日本关东军，解放了受尽痛苦的满洲与朝鲜的人民。红军的继续进攻，给予在战争中受尽痛苦的中国人民以直接帮助。渥氏指出：中日战争及太平洋战争时期内，苏联曾牵制了在鲜满的百万精锐的日军，使日本没有可能把这些军队运去反对中国人民及对美英作战。红军粉碎了这一强大兵团，使日本帝国主义继续崩溃下去，因此大大加快了日本的投降。渥氏，结语力称：这样看来，红军对于日本战略防御之强大进攻，补充了英美中对于日本陆海军的打击，而且成为最终有决定意义的打击。这一重大打击，改变了太平洋军事政治情况，加快消灭了远东的战争源地，因而造成普遍和平的可能。"

    "title": "Who is Destroying Transportation in North China?",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-12",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "(With Picture)\nWho is Destroying Transportation in North China?\n\nThe third article of the January 10th Ceasefire Order stipulates: \"Actions that damage and obstruct all transportation lines must cease, and all obstacles obstructing these transportation lines should be immediately removed.\" The so-called obstacles here primarily refer to pillboxes (碉堡). Regarding the leveling of pillboxes, the No. 4 Order of Reconciliation, issued by the Peiping (Beiping) Executive Headquarters on February 21st, contained even clearer regulations. This order was signed not only by the three members of the Executive Headquarters but also by General Zhou Enlai, General Zhang Zhizhong, and Marshal George Marshall of the Chongqing Three-Person Conference. Order No. 4 of Reconciliation requires \"the immediate removal and demolition of all landmines, pillboxes, and fortifications along transportation lines, and the cancellation and prohibition of compulsory inspections, illegal and unreasonable damage to people's travel, cargo transportation, and postal and telegraph services.\" However, Chiang Kai-shek neither changed the compulsory inspections and illegal and unreasonable damage to travel, transportation, postal and telegraph services, nor did he level pillboxes and other blockade fortifications. The pillbox policy was already extensively used by the Kuomintang army during the ten-year civil war from 1927 to 1937 as strongholds for military offensives and to blockade and cut off transportation to the then Red Army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders learned from the Kuomintang army's old tricks and built even more pillboxes. After Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang army retained the Japanese pillboxes and added many new ones. Therefore, all major transportation routes around the Liberated Areas, wherever the Japanese and Kuomintang armies had passed, were riddled with pillboxes. Since the issuance of the Ceasefire Order, the release of Order No. 4 of Reconciliation was achieved through the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party. Subsequently, the Executive Headquarters dispatched transportation teams to supervise the implementation of this order along various railway lines. However, due to the Kuomintang's fundamental lack of sincerity in compliance, this order remains a dead letter to this day. The fundamental reason for the failure to restore transportation in North China is naturally the Kuomintang's insistence on civil war, but one of the direct causes is also the Kuomintang's preservation and expansion of a large number of pillboxes on various transportation lines for the purpose of civil war. The Kuomintang deliberately misinterpreted the content of Order No. 4 of Reconciliation, saying that \"the pillboxes referred to in the order to be demolished are only those built on the railway lines, and not generally those on the side of the transportation lines or general pillboxes,\" and that \"the pillboxes that must be demolished are specifically those that 'hinder' transportation, and those that do not hinder transportation and have the effect of protecting transportation are exceptions,\" and also said that \"demolishing pillboxes is a secondary issue, and repairing railways is the top priority,\" and finally simply said \"pillboxes are national defense fortifications and cannot be demolished,\" and \"demolishing pillboxes only refers to the CCP-controlled areas and not the Kuomintang-controlled areas,\" etc., using this as an excuse to refuse demolition \"and attempting to have the CCP unilaterally comply with the order (in fact, there are no pillboxes to demolish in the Liberated Areas), while they remain at large.\" This attitude of the Kuomintang is not surprising. As early as after the issuance of the Ceasefire Order, their highest authorities secretly ordered the war zones to actively build pillbox fortifications, stating: \"Important points north of the Yangtze River, including Peiping, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Liaozhong, Tieling, Cangzhou, Baoding, Qingdao, Jiaozhou, Southern Hebei, Xuzhou, Haimen, Shijiazhuang, Nantong, etc., as well as the major railway lines in North China—the Tianjin-Cangzhou section of the Jinpu Railway, the Xuzhou-Pukou section, the Peiping-Yuanshi section of the Pinghan Railway, the Xinyang-Xinxiang section, the Datong-Taiyuan section of the Tongpu Railway, and the Xuzhou-Kaifeng section of the Longhai Railway—should immediately construct pillbox fortifications, to be completed by the end of April this year, and store enough food and ammunition for two months in each important point.\" In addition, according to the CCP's seizure of the No. 26706 telegram from the Eleventh War Zone on February 8th, relayed by Chiang Kai-shek, \"Unnecessary pillbox fortifications in various places can be decided by the commanders of each war zone to be built or demolished, but the pillbox fortifications along the railway lines cannot be demolished.\" The Kuomintang's firm refusal to demolish pillboxes can also be fully demonstrated by the following example: In March, the CCP in the Gaomi team proposed that the Kuomintang demolish pillboxes within 300 meters on both sides of the railway. They disagreed, openly saying, \"Following Chairman Chiang's order, pillboxes are not allowed to be demolished.\" The CCP retreated a step, only asking them to demolish pillboxes along the railway line within 100 meters. They still refused. Finally, the CCP even asked them to demolish a portion at random to show sincerity. When implementing the order, the other party still insisted on not demolishing.\n\nSecondly, the large-scale expansion of new pillboxes further undermined the order to restore transportation. According to incomplete statistics from the short three months from the issuance of the order to May, the number of newly built pillboxes is:\n\n(1) The Tongpu Railway originally had 2,066 pillboxes, with 491 newly built in violation of the order, totaling 2,597. The number of new constructions accounted for 19% of the original number of pillboxes. The center of construction was along the railway line in the southern Shanxi triangle area and between Datong and Taiyuan (there are 1,250 new and old pillboxes between Datong and Taiyuan, one every mile). The Tongpu Railway was the earliest to build pillboxes, and its \"achievements are particularly great.\"\n\n(2) The Pinghan Railway originally had 904, with 120 newly built, totaling 1,024. The new construction accounted for 12% of the existing pillboxes. The center was in the Anyang-Xinxiang section (96 pillboxes in 210 miles) and the Queshan-Xiaogan section, with the aim of isolating the connection between the east and west sides of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army. In addition, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and Xincheng were also the focus of their pillbox construction. In Shijiazhuang, new pillboxes were built in all important city streets and entertainment venues, one every five steps. There are four blockade lines in the suburbs, connected by communication trenches, and the trenches are densely covered with booby traps. There are 610 in total.\n\n(3) The Jinpu Railway originally had 457, with 168 newly built, totaling 625. The new construction accounted for 27% of the existing pillboxes. The center was in the Xuzhou-Pukou section (190 on both sides of the line between Xuzhou and Suxian, five every two miles from Suxian to Caocun). The connection between Huaibei and Subei and between Huainan and Subei has now been cut off. The areas around Cangzhou, Jinan, Yanzhou, and Lincheng are also the focus of their pillbox construction. In Lincheng, Chen Daqing ordered his subordinates to cut down more than a hundred trees and demolish more than twenty civilian houses to build pillboxes. There are now 230 new and old ones, with an average of one pillbox every 0.4 miles on the entire line.\n\n(4) The Jiaoji Railway originally had 88, with 48 newly built, totaling 136. The new construction accounted for 35% of the existing pillboxes. The focus was around Gaomi, in addition to the railway line, they occupied our villages and towns on both sides. There are 83 from Qingdao to Weixian, and it is planned to build one every mile. Ditches more than a zhang deep and wide were dug on the side of the road, and wire mesh was set up. There is an average of one every 1.2 miles on the entire line.\n\n(5) The Daoqing Railway originally had 127, with 122 newly built, totaling 247, accounting for 47% of the existing pillboxes. The focus was around Xiuwu, with an average of one every 1.2 miles.\n\n(6) The Zhengtai Railway originally had 183, with 25 newly built, totaling 208, accounting for 12% of the original number. There are 120 new and old ones from Niangziguan to Yangquan, an average of one every 1.4 miles.\n\n(7) The Baijin Railway originally had 81, with 12 newly built, totaling 93, accounting for 13% of the existing pillboxes. There is an average of one every 1.1 miles. Since there were already many old pillboxes on this line, there was no need for major expansion.\n\n(8) The Beining Railway originally had 32, with 13 newly built, totaling 45, accounting for 29% of the existing pillboxes. Most of this line is guarded by the U.S. military, so there is no need to build many pillboxes.\n\n(9) The Pingsui Railway originally had 27, with 30 newly built, totaling 57, accounting for 52% of the existing pillboxes. The focus was on the Nankou-Qinglongqiao section and the Qixiaying-Taobuqi section, which greatly threatened our Zhangjiakou.\n\n(10) The Beikou Railway originally had 5, with 5 newly built, totaling 10, accounting for 50% of the existing pillboxes. The center was along the line between Shunyi and Miyun. There were fewer pillboxes built because it was very close to the Peiping Executive Headquarters, for fear of criticism.\n\nThe total number of pillboxes on all railway lines was originally 3,880, with 1,032 newly built, totaling 4,912. The construction time was 104 before February, the most in March, reaching 558, and 370 in April, less than in March, because the pillbox construction plan had been largely completed. The Kuomintang's highest authorities ordered completion by the end of April (an average of 344 pillboxes were built per month, more than eight times faster than the Japanese invaders. The Japanese invaders began building pillboxes in 1939, averaging only 46 per month). In addition to building new pillboxes, the Kuomintang army also renovated many old pillboxes. For example, in the Xinxiang area, several layers were added to the one-story pillboxes built by the enemy for the purpose of expanding the civil war. This is also where they are \"bluer than blue.\" During the Nanjing negotiations in early June, CCP representative Zhou Enlai and Kuomintang Minister of Communications Yu Dajun reached an agreement on the issue of restoring transportation. However, due to the Kuomintang's unreasonable demand that our army withdraw from Subei, Rehe, and other places, and insisting that other issues would not be resolved until this issue was resolved, the talks on restoring transportation failed to yield any results.

The telegram stated: \"The wise policies of the late President Roosevelt and President Truman's statements on China have now been openly abandoned by the reactionaries in your country. Due to the unbridled participation of US troops stationed in China in China's civil war, especially now that they have further torn off the mask of neutrality and directly assisted Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops in attacking Sanhe, Xianghe, and other places in the Jidong Liberated Area, the independence and peace that the Chinese people have fought for with blood for a long time have now been severely undermined by the Chinese and American reactionaries. This erroneous policy of American imperialist elements, which endangers world peace, is also contrary to the wishes and interests of American workers. We urgently appeal: (1) Demand that American workers rise up to correct the erroneous policies of the US government, withdraw the US army, navy, and air force stationed in China, cease military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and withdraw from China's civil war vortex. (2) Stop any material assistance and the transportation of troops and equipment to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary clique, and demand that American railway workers and dockworkers unanimously refuse to transport any materials that could promote China's civil war.\" The telegram concluded: \"If the United States only implements the above two points, China will move towards peace and democracy, and China and the United States can have friendly cooperation and enhance friendship and economic development between the two countries.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋察冀工会呼吁美国工人  纠正美当局侵华政策  撤退驻华美军停止军事援蒋\n\n1946-08-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋察冀工会呼吁美国工人            \n    纠正美当局侵华政策     \n    撤退驻华美军停止军事援蒋\n    【新华社张家口九日电】驻中国北宁路美军陆战队，公开协助蒋军向冀东解放区香河、三河大举进攻。晋察冀边区各职工团体领袖、晋察冀总工会主任马辉之、冀中总工会主任陈宝玉、冀晋总工会主任顾守真、冀东总工会主任丁一、热河总工会主任郝占元、察哈尔省总工会主任李痴、张家口总工会主任萧明、电业总工会主任陈儒仁、矿山总工会主任孙玉惠、邮务总工会主任冯树章、平绥铁路总工会主任徐平等，顷代表边区四十万工人急电美国产业工会联合会主席莫莱、劳工联合会主席格林等，呼吁美国工人兄弟迅速起来制止美反动派此种对华侵略干涉政策。该电称：“故罗斯福总统明智的政策及杜鲁门总统对华声明，现已被贵国反动派公开抛弃，由于驻华美军肆无忌惮的参与中国内战，特别目前已进一步撕毁中立的面目，直接协助蒋介石反动军队进攻冀东解放区三河、香河等地，中国人民长期浴血抗战所争取的独立和平，现已遭到中美反动派极其严重的破坏。美帝国主义分子此种危害世界和平的错误政策，同样是违背美国工人愿望和利益的。我们紧急呼吁：（１）要求美国工人起来纠正美国政府的错误政策，撤退驻华的海陆空军，停止军事援蒋，退出中国的内战漩涡。（２）停止对蒋介石反动派任何物资援助与运兵运械，并要求美国铁路工人与码头工人一致拒运任何足以促成中国内战的物资。该电最后称：只要求美国实行以上两条，中国就能走向和平民主，中美两国就可以友好合作，并增进两国友谊及经济发展。"

More than 20 representatives from the Border Region Government Education Department, Handan Education Section, Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, Handan Middle School, People's Education Center and other units attended. Directors Chao and Cui from the Education Department both participated. At the meeting, Principal Zhang of Handan Middle School reported on the school's development process, the ideological trends of students, and preliminary opinions on the school's vocationalization.\n\nIn the afternoon, Director Chao expressed his opinions. He first described the development of education in our border region, saying: Primary schools are the closest to the masses, and the masses have risen up to transform schools after their liberation. The number of schools and students has increased sharply, and the results are the best. Higher primary schools are farther away from the masses, and the transformation is worse. Middle schools are the farthest away from the masses, and most of them still retain the old set of college-oriented education that is divorced from practical needs. Since the \"middle school education cultivates cadres\" policy was promulgated, those who transformed according to this policy have also created a \"dual task\" approach, that is, training older and less intelligent students to become cadres, while still allowing younger and more intelligent students to go to college. Today, the transformation of middle schools should be aimed at the practical needs of our border region's backward rural areas and underdeveloped industries, cultivating \"production cadres\" and \"small and medium-sized entrepreneurs\" for production and construction, that is, small and medium-sized cadres with \"a specific skill,\" so that each student must possess: \"production technology; production knowledge; and the spirit of serving the masses.\" He said: \"In order to achieve this quickly and thoroughly, we must clear our minds and attach farms and factories to schools so that teachers and students have the opportunity to practice. At the same time, we can also engage in production for profit to supplement the school's insufficient funding and solve the difficulties of teachers and students.\"\n\nIn order to enable everyone to further study this new policy and its implementation methods, it is specifically stipulated that discussions and work inspections should be carried out in groups by school. In addition to using this report as the center for discussing documents, the \"Base Area Education Reform Plan,\" \"On the Construction of Chinese Normal Education,\" \"Middle School Education Policy of Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region,\" and \"Provisional Program for Secondary School Education in Taihang\" are designated as required reference documents. Finally, it was decided to hold a general symposium on the tenth of this month.

According to a US News Agency report from Washington on the 7th: The University of Chicago organized a round table conference on the 4th of this month to discuss the Chinese situation. Participants included Far East news correspondent Stein (author of \"Another China\"), former Far East news correspondent and current New York Times reporter Smith, and University of Chicago Far East history professor McNair (chairman of the round table conference). Stein accused the Kuomintang of not implementing Sun Yat-sen's plan and of not fulfilling its promises in the peace plan. Stein demanded the withdrawal of US troops stationed in China and the cessation of aid to Chiang. At the same time, the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation's \"People's Forum\" (a special current affairs discussion program) also discussed this issue. Forman (author of \"Report on the Liberated Areas of China\") and Colbert (who chaired the discussion) participated in the discussion. Forman demanded the immediate withdrawal of US troops stationed in China. CBS commentator Seed declared regarding the CCP-KMT issue: \"Unite together and stop shooting. The American people do not want to be involved in the vortex of China's civil war. We only want the Chinese people to freely choose any government they need.\" The Chinese people fought alone for nearly seven years before gaining independence. Please provide the Chinese people with food, not cannons.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: American journalist Anna Louise Strong advocates that China must establish a genuine coalition government and opposes US aid to Chiang Kai-shek. On July 17th, when a reporter from the Shanghai English-language China Daily Mail asked if there was hope for peace negotiations in China, Strong replied: \"Regarding this point, it is hoped that the Chinese government will take wise measures to establish a genuine coalition government that represents public opinion from the bottom up, which is especially necessary in China today. The die-hards may lose power as a result, but only in this way can the Kuomintang be saved.\" Regarding American aid, she said: \"If a coalition government is not established, aid to China at this time is tantamount to sending bullets to the conservatives.\" Strong believes that \"the United States uses its huge capital to implement a dumping policy in the Chinese market, which not only destroys China's national industry, but also drives China down the path of suicide, becoming an economically dependent country that will never be able to recover.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 8th: We have just received the latest issue of the New China Review magazine published in Manila, which criticizes the US reactionary group's policy of military aid to Chiang. The article stated: If Chiang Kai-shek were not to receive the assistance of American imperialism, the irresistible demands of the Chinese people to end the Kuomintang's fascist one-party rule or to establish a democratic coalition government of all parties and factions would have been achieved long ago. The article continued: The main responsibility for the Chinese civil war and the destruction of peace in the Far East and the entire world should be borne by American imperialism. If the American people do not want to become sharers of this responsibility, just as the German people allowed themselves to become sharers of the crimes of Hitlerism, they must defeat the conspiracies of American imperialists. At this time, they should ensure the withdrawal of US troops from North China. We, the progressive intellectuals of the Philippines, must more loudly and unequivocally condemn Chiang Kai-shek's fascist regime and the assistance given to him by American imperialists.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美菲舆论大声疾呼  美军应即撤离中国  美国人民不欲卷入中国内战漩涡！\n\n1946-08-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　  美菲舆论大声疾呼            \n    美军应即撤离中国            \n    美国人民不欲卷入中国内战漩涡！\n    【新华社延安九日电】美国舆论群起要求撤退驻华美军及停止以武器援蒋。据美新闻处华府七日电：本月四日芝加哥大学布置一圆桌会议，讨论中国局势，参加讨论者有远东新闻特派员史坦因（“另一个中国”一书作者），前远东新闻通讯员现任纽约时报记者史密斯，及芝加哥大学远东历史教授麦克奈纳（任圆桌会议主席）。史坦因指责国民党未实行孙中山之计划，且不履行和平方案中之诺言。史坦因要求撤退驻华美军及中止援蒋，同时哥伦比亚广播公司之“群众论坛”（按系特设时事讨论节目）亦讨论此一问题，福尔曼（“中国解放区印象记”一书作者）及柯尔堡（他任主席）参加讨论，福尔曼要求立即撤退驻华美军。交换广播公司之评论员希德，关于国共问题宣称：“团结一致停止射击，美国人民不欲卷入中国内战之漩涡，我们仅欲中国人民自由选择其所需要之任何政府。”中国人民单独作战近七年之久，方获得独立，请以粮食供给中国人民，而勿以大炮予之。\n    【新华社延安九日电】美名记者史特朗女士主张中国必须成立真正的联合政府，并反对美国援助蒋介石。七月十七日，上海英文大陆晚报记者询以中国和平谈判是否有望时，史特朗女士答称：“关于此点，惟望中国政府有英明之措置，自下而上建立真正代表民意之联合政府，在今日之中国尤为必要。顽固派或将因之失势，但惟有如此，国民党始能获救。”谈及美国之援助，她说：“联合政府若不成立，此时对华之援助，不啻为保守派送子弹。”史特朗女士认为“美国运用其庞大资本，对中国市场施行倾销政策，其结果不惟破坏中国之民族工业，而且驱中国走上自杀之途，成为经济上附庸之国家，永世不得翻身。\n    【新华社张家口八日电】此间顷收到马尼拉出版的最近一期新中国评论杂志，著文斥责美反动集团军事援蒋政策。该文称：假若不让蒋介石获得美帝国主义的援助，则中国人民势不可当的关于结束国民党法西斯一党统治或成立各党各派的民主联合政府之要求早已达成了。该文继称：中国内战以及远东与整个世界和平的破坏，其主要责任应由美国帝国主义负责。美国人民如不要成为这种责任的分担者，如像德国人民允许他们自己成为希特勒主义罪行的分担者一样，他们就必须击败美帝国主义者的阴谋。在这时候，他们应保证美军由华北撤退，我们菲律滨进步知识分子必须更响亮的毫不含糊地谴责蒋介石法西斯政体及美帝国主义者给他的援助。"

After the Wangcun militia and village cadres discovered that their houses were surrounded by the enemy (the sentry on the roof was leading the enemy in, by a local traitor, Yao Jinrui), Military Committee Director Yao Lianchun immediately led everyone to fight bravely against the enemy amidst the dense grenades and bullets, holding out for a long time, and then fought their way out of the encirclement with great effort. The enemy was trapped and never dared to enter the house. The enemy invading Nansu originally planned to capture Han Zhilu alive, but as soon as the enemy entered the village, the militia who were sleeping collectively were awakened by the sentry's horn. They immediately rushed out in two directions. The group led by Han Zhilu ran head-on into the enemy. When Han heard the enemy calling out his name, he immediately turned around and broke through the enemy's weak side. When Comrade Han Zhilu saw his family members being brutally murdered, he was not frightened or pessimistic, but became even more determined. Looking at the blood-stained corpses, he said sadly: \"Kill! The more fiercely the reactionaries kill, the more resolute I will be!

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 8th: The Suwan Border Region Temporary Council, in order to expose the truth about the Kuomintang reactionaries' creation of the so-called \"Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group\" to coordinate with military offensives, and to call on those who have been deceived and exploited to awaken and return, has issued a letter to compatriots from Northern Jiangsu living in Southern Jiangsu. It first pointed out: \"Recently, the Kuomintang reactionaries have used the so-called 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group's' return to their hometowns, which they themselves orchestrated, as an excuse to attack the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area, attempting to cover up their crime of launching a civil war. The Kuomintang reactionaries constantly shout about 'refugees returning home' and 'relieving refugees,' but in fact, they have seized vehicles and ships across the country to transport troops, ammunition, and military supplies to carry out a civil war. Tens of thousands of homeless refugees wandering in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places are unable to return home because they have no vehicles or ships. In Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and other provinces, there are more than 40 million disaster victims. What is the reactionary faction's relief situation? Even in our Northern Jiangsu area, due to the continuous mopping-up and 'clearing the villages' by the enemy and puppets in the past, coupled with the floods and insect plagues last year, a serious famine occurred this spring. Apart from the local democratic government's efforts to rescue, the Kuomintang authorities not only provided no relief but also tried to swallow and withhold the UNRRA relief supplies that should have been allocated to the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area. This is the reactionary faction's true attitude towards refugees across the country and refugees in Northern Jiangsu.\"\n\nThe letter then analyzes the composition of those who control the so-called \"Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group\": \"The first are the big and small traitors who surrendered to the Japanese devils in the past, and the secret service agents who committed crimes. Some of them, knowing that they cannot be tolerated by the law of the country, fled to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, willingly acting as pawns of the reactionaries. Isn't Tao Guanxian, the director of the 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Reception Center' in Yangzhou, the former councilor of Sun Gencheng, the traitor of the puppet Fifth Army? Among those received, aren't there also Xu Ganchen, the former adjutant director of the puppet 33rd Division, Yuan Tieshi, the puppet brigade commander, and many puppet officials and soldiers? Isn't Yuan Jiehou, the director of the 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Reception Center' in Zhenjiang, the former war criminal who partnered with a puppet division commander Ding in Yangzhou to open a money shop and make a fortune from the national crisis? Second, some people have been deceived by the reactionary faction's propaganda and shameless rumors, and dare not return to their hometowns, and are being used. Third, some are genuine refugees who originally came from Northern Jiangsu but have lost their jobs and educational opportunities under the dark rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, with no way out. Apart from a very few, most of these three groups are kind compatriots who have been temporarily deceived and exploited by the reactionary faction. Although they have unfortunately been dragged into the quagmire, their lives and their circumstances deserve our infinite sympathy.\" The letter pointed out: \"The army and people in the Suwan Liberated Area have sufficient self-defense forces to smash the reactionary faction's offensive. We hope that they will not become the reactionary faction's senseless sacrifices, and sincerely call on those who have been deceived and exploited to awaken and return: 'You should jump out of the cage and return to your hometowns as soon as possible. We dare to guarantee with our lives that you will receive the same legal protection from the democratic government. Similarly, the democratic government will provide relief and help you settle down and produce, and solve various difficulties in your life. For those who have done some wrong to society and the people in the past but are not guilty of heinous crimes, as long as you repent and start anew, and are no longer used by the reactionary faction, the democratic government will be magnanimous and not hold the past against you. You can also return to your hometowns and live and work in peace and contentment.'\" Finally, it shouted: \"Compatriots in Suwan, unite to oppose the civil war! Oppose the reactionary faction's deception of Northern Jiangsu compatriots to participate in the civil war! Welcome the 'Northern Jiangsu Refugee Group' to turn around and defend the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area! Defend national peace!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖边区参议会  致书江南苏北同胞  揭发国民党苏北难民团真象号召被骗利用分子觉醒来归\n\n1946-08-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　  苏皖边区参议会            \n    致书江南苏北同胞            \n    揭发国民党苏北难民团真象号召被骗利用分子觉醒来归\n    【新华社延安八日电】苏皖边区临参会为揭发国民党反动派配合军事进攻制造所谓“苏北难民团”的真象，并号召被欺骗利用者的觉悟来归，特发表告旅江南的苏北同胞书。首先指出：“最近国民党反动派利用他们一手导演的所谓‘苏北难民团’的还乡，把这作为进攻苏北解放区的借口，企图以此掩盖他们发动内战的罪恶。国民党反动派口里成天喊着：“难民还乡”和“救济难民”，事实上他们强占了全国的车辆和船只，运兵运军火和军用物资以进行内战。而流浪在重庆成都昆明等地若干万无家可归的难胞，则因为没有车船而无法还乡。四川、湖南、江西、广西等省灾胞在四千万以上，反动派救济的情形究竟怎样呢？就是在我苏北地区由于过去敌伪不断扫荡清乡又加上去年的水灾和虫灾，以致今年春天发生了严重的灾荒现象。除了这里的民主政府尽力抢救外，国民党当局不但没有什么救济，反而对苏北解放区应该分得的联总救济物资亦多方加以吞没扣留，这就是反动派对全国难民与苏北难民的真实态度。”\n    该书继分析所谓“苏北难民团”操纵者的成份：第一个是过去投降日本鬼子的大小汉奸，和为非作恶的特务分子，他们有的自知不容于国法，逃到国民党统治地区，甘心做反动派的爪牙。最近在扬州作“苏北难民收容所”所长的陶管贤不就是曾经干过伪第五军孙逆艮诚的参议吗？所收容的不是还有伪三十三师副官主任徐逆干臣和伪旅长袁逆铁石以及许多伪官伪兵吗？在镇江任“苏北难民收容所”所长的袁介侯，不就是过去和伪师长丁某在扬州合伙开设钱庄发了国难财的汉奸战犯吗？第二、有一部分人是受了反动派的欺骗宣传和无耻造谣的影响，不敢回到家乡，而被利用的。第三、一部分原籍苏北，因在国民党反动派黑暗统治下失业失学，毫无出路的真正难胞。以上三部分人，除了极少数外，大多数是一时受反动派欺骗利用的善良同胞，他们虽不幸被拖进了泥坑，而他们的生活，他们的境遇，是值得我们寄予无限同情的”。该书指出：“苏皖解放区军民有充分的自卫力量，足以粉碎反动派的进攻。希望他们不要做反动派的无谓牺牲品，并诚恳地号召被欺骗被利用的人们觉悟来归：“你们赶快跳出牢笼回到自己的家乡来，我们敢以身家性命担保你们能同样受到民主政府的法律保障。同样的，民主政府会救济帮助你们安家生产，解决生活上的各种困难。对于那些过去曾经有一些对不起社会和人民而并非罪大恶极的人们，只要你们悔过自新，不再受反动派利用，民主政府是宽大为怀不咎既往的。你们同样可以回到家乡安居乐业。”最后，高呼：“苏皖同胞团结起来反对内战！反对反动派欺骗苏北同胞参加内战！欢迎“苏北难民团”回转头来保卫苏北解放区！保卫全国和平！”"

    "date": "1946-08-12",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "(Attached Photo)\n　　The Soviet Union Shifts to Peaceful Production\n    By William Mandel, USA\n    During the war, Soviet doctors had to develop a sixth sense—a sense of temperature—because there were absolutely no thermometers outside of military hospitals. Now doctors can rely on science instead of instinct again. In the last three months of 1945, Soviet aircraft factories manufactured two million clinical thermometers. They also manufactured the same number of spoons, four million plates, 30,000 meat grinders, 30,000 children's sleds, 25,000 bicycles, 40,000 metal beds, 40,000 door locks, 25,000 teapots and coffee pots, and 200 cooking stoves—for housewives in cities without gas.\n\n    If the Soviet Union's aircraft industry is smaller than that of the United States—although not as much smaller as generally believed—then their tank industry is much larger than that of the United States. The United States produced 17,000 tanks in 1944. The Soviet Union has not yet revealed its production figures, but one factory alone, moved to the Urals in the early years of the war, manufactured 18,000 sixty-ton tanks during the four years of the war. The United States did not produce this type of tank until the war was almost over. Another factory manufactured 35,000 medium tanks. Now it is manufacturing wheels and axles for railway cars. While the aircraft industry will continue to manufacture military and civilian aircraft, the tank industry has completely converted, even changing its name. It is now called the People's Commissariat of Transport Equipment. One large factory only produces passenger cars, while others will produce 250,000 freight cars this year.\n\n    After the Five-Year Plan, when the factory in Gorky (on the Volga River) reaches 90,000 workers, it will then produce 300,000 vehicles per year, mainly trucks, 10% more than the total output of all Soviet factories in 1937.\n\n    No industry is easy to convert, but textile factories only need to adjust from military to civilian requirements. But in southern Ukraine, the Soviet Union faces another major problem—reconstruction. The areas occupied by the German army, comprising 88 million people, had half of their power plants. In addition to carrying away about 14,000 furnaces, 1,400 turbines, and 11,300 generators, the Germans set fire to what remained. Finally, they effectively destroyed the Dnieper Dam, so that it will not be able to generate electricity until 1946, and it will take another three years to reach full production.\n\n    Most of the equipment for the Dnieper Dam was made in the United States, but the power plant's output only reaches one-tenth of what was destroyed. What about the rest? During the war years, the Soviet Union installed new generating capacity equal to that of the entire Five-Year Plan period.\n\n    Most of this energy comes from a factory called \"Elektrosila.\" Its recovery represents the characteristic spirit of the Soviet Union today. It is a generator factory in Leningrad. For thirty months, from August 1941 to January 1944, its huge building, visible from the front lines, mocked the German besiegers in the trenches around the city. They knew it was being used for military production and repeatedly bombed and shelled it every day. Official reports indicated that the factory had been hit by hundreds of bombs and \"thousands\" of shells. It has only been two years since it was last shelled, but in 1945, it produced generating equipment with energy equal to the entire Dnieper Dam—the largest in Europe.\n\n    Other factories in Leningrad also created similar miracles. The microscope is one of the most precise instruments. Its lenses, focus, and micrometers cannot have the slightest deviation. Its manufacturing requires the highest technical standards and precision. In 1945—one year after liberation from the siege—Leningrad manufactured 12,000 microscopes, enough to re-equip dozens of destroyed universities, and 1,500 movie projectors to bring a little entertainment to the lives of people in the devastated areas. Leningrad also has equipment for manufacturing radar, which was even a first for the Soviet Union.\n\n    The manufacture of linotype machines is another of the most complex and sophisticated industries, including 6,500 parts, and requiring 20 special tools. One factory in Leningrad planned to manufacture 230 linotype machines in 1946, several times the equipment needed for the world's largest newspapers.\n\n    Leningrad endured hunger and bombardment for two and a half years and was never actually occupied. Ukraine, however, was occupied. A small area of Ukraine, the Soviet Ruhr region, is a solid fortress of coal mines, steel mills, and factories. This is the Donbas. A large part of it is within the Stalin Oblast, which, with one-sixtieth of the Soviet population, produces 40% of the Soviet Union's coking coal, 40% of its salt, 30% of its coal and pig iron, and 23% of its steel. German demolition teams paid special attention to leaving nothing that could be used, and this area bore the brunt of it. When Soviet industrial experts followed the advancing troops into this area in September 1943 to conduct a survey, they were shocked. Ninety-nine and a half percent of the region's productive capacity had been destroyed or rendered inoperable.\n\n    In July 1945—22 months after the region was liberated—the Soviet Union conducted another survey in Stalin Oblast. Machines were running all day, workers were pushing handcarts between the continuing bomb craters, and total production had reached 57% of pre-war levels. Heavy industry, requiring huge equipment, had not yet reached this level, but was also recovering. The production of pig iron and steel was slightly more than a quarter of normal levels. Factory engineers had accomplished an unprecedented feat: they raised entire blast furnaces and put them back on their foundations. Work in the coal mines was even better. Daily excavation was already two-fifths of pre-war levels because the Soviets knew how to drain the mines without using pumps.\n\n    The full figures for Donbas coal mine production in the second half of 1945 are not yet available, but we know that from 1933 to 1937, over those five years, Soviet heavy machinery factories manufactured 64 mining cranes, giant heavy-tonnage elevators, and equipment with excavators capable of digging thousands of feet deep. And in 1945, in one hundred days—from August to November—23 were built.\n\n    This accelerated work in the heavy machinery industry is not limited to coal mining equipment. Everyone, from Stalin to railway workers, recognizes that the faster they help the country recover, the sooner they will benefit themselves. To a Soviet person, a new record is not just a number, it means a better life. He is willing to use all his energy to make production faster. He knows that if agriculture is given more machines, there will be more bread on his table.\n\n    The most massive of the steel rolling equipment is the steel rolling mill, which requires the output of two large blast furnaces and thirty open-hearth furnaces to supply it. Before the war, the United States took ten years to build thirteen, while now the Soviet Union is building six or seven in three years.\n\n    The reconstruction record to date—mainly while the country was still at war—clearly shows that the Soviet Union is capable of self-reliance when necessary.

At dawn on July 18th, the traitor Wei Yonghe, under the direction of the traitor Hou Ruyong, personally led more than 500 puppet troops from Yuanshi, combined with over 1,000 special agents and returning landlords, who were led by special agents from Wuzhuang and Wangcun, to surround fifteen villages and towns including Wuzhuang and Nansu in Yuanshi, which our army liberated last summer. They carried out wanton burning and killing, resulting in the sacrifice of seventeen cadres, masses, and militiamen, with three wounded and forty-eight cadres and militiamen captured. According to incomplete statistics, nine militiamen's rifles, sixty-four cattle, donkeys, and mules, eighty sheep, seventy-eight carts, and six carts of cloth and clothing were looted. Most of the pots, pans, furniture, and other items in the villages that were inconvenient to carry away were destroyed. In the Nansu militia captain Han Zhilu's family, six out of nine members were brutally killed. Han's wife was injured by a cart but survived. Han's younger sisters were terrified and collapsed in the pool of blood, Han's father hid upon hearing the sound, and was able to prevent his entire family from being harmed.\n\nThe traitor Wei Yonghe surrendered to the enemy in 1940, committing numerous evils. After the Japanese surrender, he was commissioned by Hu Zongnan as the 7th Brigade of the 1st Vanguard Column of the First War Area. He was commended by Chiang Kai-shek in February for his merits in the civil war's burning and killing. After the ceasefire agreement, he received ample ammunition supplies from Chiang Kai-shek and became even more intensified in his attacks, invading more than 200 times and occupying more than ten of our villages and towns. Recently, under the command of the traitor Hou Ruyong, he carried out this shocking massacre.\n\nThis heinous crime has aroused unparalleled anger among the military and civilians in the entire Taihang region. The First Sub-district of Taihang has issued an urgent call to the militiamen and masses of the sub-district, urging them to mobilize and resolutely oppose the massacre's perpetrator, Wei Yonghe, and avenge the dead fathers and brothers. They are also calling on the military and civilians of the entire region to express condolences and provide relief to the affected villages with cloth, cotton, and grain. The Taihang District Party Committee has also sent letters of condolence to the victimized people, pointing out that the massacre committed by the traitors Hou and Wei is closely linked to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war. At the same time, it pointed out that this is a sign of the last days of the fascist reactionaries, who, in the face of their doom, can only use special agent policies and fascist armed forces to brutally kill the people and suppress the patriotic movement of the people across the country to maintain their traitorous and dictatorial rule. The District Party Committee further called on the people of the entire region to turn grief and indignation into courage, raise vigilance, strictly investigate special agents and traitors, organize to defend the border areas, and avenge the dead.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋伪侯如墉魏永和血腥劫掠  屠杀我元氏和平居民  太行区党委号召：  把悲愤变成勇敢为死者复仇\n\n1946-08-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋伪侯如墉魏永和血腥劫掠            \n    屠杀我元氏和平居民   \n    太行区党委号召：\n    把悲愤变成勇敢为死者复仇\n    【本报长治讯】（迟到）继武乡青修惨案之后，七月十八日蒋伪军侯如墉、魏永和两逆又在元氏南苏、武庄一带十五村镇制造了惊人的血腥屠杀疯狂掠夺的巨大惨案。七月十八日拂晓魏逆永和在侯逆如墉指使下，亲率元氏伪军五百余，结合特务还乡团共千余人，由武庄、王村特务带路，将我军于去夏解放之元氏武庄、南苏等十五村镇包围，大肆烧杀，干部群众民兵牺牲十七人，负伤三人，被俘去干部及民兵四十八人；据不完全统计，并被劫去民兵步枪九支，牛驴骡六十四头，羊八十只，大车七十八辆，布匹衣服六大车，各村不便拉走之锅碗家具等件大部被捣毁。南苏民兵队长韩之禄家九口人即被惨杀六口，韩妻负车伤未死，韩之小姊妹被吓倒在血泊中，韩父闻声秘藏，始免于全家被害。\n    按魏逆永和系一九四○年投敌，作恶多端，日寇投降后，被胡宗南委编为第一战区先遣第一纵队第七旅，曾因内战烧杀有功，于二月间博得蒋介石传令嘉奖。停战协定后得到蒋介石充分的枪弹补给，乃更变本加厉，进犯益猛，先后出犯二百多次，占我村镇十余处，近更在侯逆如墉指挥下制造了此次惊人惨案。\n    这一滔天罪行已引起我太行全区军民的无比愤怒。太行一分区特向该分区民兵、群众发出紧急号召，号召他们动员起来，坚决反对制造惨案刽子手魏永和，为死难父兄报仇；号召全区军民以布匹、棉花、粮食等慰问及救济被难村庄。太行区党委亦致函慰问被害人民；并指出侯、魏两奸制造此次惨案是与蒋介石卖国内战紧密联系着的，同时，指出这是法西斯反动派末日的表征，他们在死的厄运面前，只有用特务政策、法西斯武装残杀人民镇压全国人民的爱国运动，维持他们卖国独裁的统治。区党委继号召全区人民把悲愤变成勇敢，提高警惕性，严密清查特务奸细，有组织的保卫边地，为死者复仇。"

Amidst the applause of the masses, Jiao said, \"These 65 mu of land were seized by warlords Shang Zhen and Huang Guanghua (Note by the reporter: Shang Zhen was then the commander of the Kuomintang 32nd Army, and Huang Guanghua was the commander of the division) before the War of Resistance, and turned into a large parade ground. When the Japanese devils came, they also used it as a parade ground and warehouse. After the democratic government came, it cleaned up the enemy's occupation of the people's property, and returned it to whom it belonged, returning these 65 mu to me. I can't farm so much land now, and many villagers have no land to farm, so I donate it to the City People's Association to be distributed to the villagers who have no land to farm forever. I also have some surplus houses, and if anyone has no place to live, I can give them some.\" Mr. Jiao also handed over all the land deeds to the City People's Association on the spot to show his sincerity. (Agricultural)\n\n　　[Another Dispatch] In order to further mobilize and organize the broad masses to carry out the anti-traitor liquidation and emancipation movement, the City Salvation Association, after investigating and studying several villages, specially formulated the \"Citizens' Anti-Traitor Liquidation Struggle Program\" on August 1st, and sent it to various villages for detailed discussion and study in order to thoroughly implement it. The program is divided into seven articles, the contents of which are as follows:\n\n　　1. Thoroughly liquidate the crimes of traitors and compensate for the loss of life and property of the people. Petty traitors should confess their guilt to everyone and start anew.\n\n　　2. Liquidate the corruption and waste of the puppet township governments, indiscriminate spending, sheltering large households, and unfair apportionment. The grain, money, and corvee labor that large households rely on their power to evade or pay less should be investigated and compensated to us.\n\n　　3. Oppose local bullies relying on their power to bully others, and force them to return the houses and land they have seized.\n\n　　4. Oppose false mortgages and false sales, concealing unregistered land, evading burdens, and shifting burdens, where one person benefits and everyone suffers. The grain and money that should be paid should be investigated and compensated to us.\n\n　　5. Thoroughly liquidate high rents, high interest rates, and illegal exploitation without pay, compensate us for our losses, and solve our housing and land difficulties.\n\n　　6. Organize to solve our difficulties with capital and furniture. Use democratic evaluation to reasonably allocate loans, develop factories and handicrafts, and organize cooperatives.\n\n　　7. Brothers who are oppressed and exploited should unite, oppose special agents spreading rumors and scaring us with \"changing the sky.\" Whoever sabotages our emancipation, we will resolutely fight them. Develop membership, organize militias, strengthen our forces, and defend our emancipation. (Xiao Fang)\n\n　　[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi] The Taihang District Committee of the Communist Party of China highly commended Comrade Zhai Shixian, a teacher at Peking University, for voluntarily donating land for distribution to poor peasants for cultivation, which is conducive to the development of \"land to the tiller.\" It sent separate letters to Comrade Zhai and the Wu'an County Party Committee to express encouragement and called on all party members in the district to learn from Zhai. The original letters are as follows:\n\n　　(1) Comrade Zhai Shixian: In the spirit of a communist, you have modeled yourself by donating your private property to peasants with little or no land, promoting the emancipation movement led by the Party, and setting an example for Taihang party members and cadres to dedicate land to realize the Party's proposition. This is of great help to the implementation of the Party's land policy. We extend our condolences to you for this exemplary behavior of a party member. Taihang District Committee (August 7th)\n\n　　(2) Comrades of the Wu'an County Party Committee: Comrade Zhai Shixian has earnestly promoted the Party's land policy and implemented the exemplary land donation and distributed his property. You should conduct a general discussion of this exemplary action among party members and cadres: how to sacrifice personal interests and obey the interests of the Party. Call on everyone to learn from Comrade Zhai Shixian. At the same time, after Comrade Shixian's land donation, attention should be paid to the necessary production expenses for his family's livelihood, so as not to suffer from hunger and cold due to the land donation.

Since the beginning of last month, Yan's army has been forcibly collecting the fourth batch of military grain after the wheat harvest. Countless farmers have been forced to flee or even commit suicide. Zhang Kuifu, a farmer in Beiying Village, Hongtong, committed suicide on the evening of the 6th of last month by hacking his daughter-in-law to death with a kitchen knife and then jumping into a well after failing to hand over three stones and one dou of wheat. Along the Tongpu Railway, Yan Xishan has openly issued orders to seize grain. On the 22nd, the \"Love the Country Corps\" of the 66th Division of Yan's army stationed in Xiangling held a second grain grabbing meeting, and local grain prices immediately tripled. The 37th Division of Yan's army that invaded the Dongquan area of Pingyao has seized more than 3,000 stones of grain from the masses in the past week. On the 4th, more than 300 soldiers of the 44th Division of Yan's army seized 40 stones of grain from farmers in Yangzao Village, Huoxian County, in one instance. The family of Niu Yongkui alone had 15 stones of wheat seized. During the grain grabbing, this unit of Yan's army discovered a hidden grain cellar with more than 20 farmers taking refuge inside. In addition to seizing all 57 stones of grain, Yan's army set fire to the cellar, burning all the farmers inside to death. Currently, the people in the Yan army's controlled areas are extremely panicked and are fleeing to the Liberated Areas to make a living. The Hongtong Democratic Government has officially established a resettlement committee to prepare land and grain to help the refugees settle down and resume production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阎军火烧农民疯狂抢粮  同蒲线农民自杀逃亡\n\n1946-08-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阎军火烧农民疯狂抢粮            \n    同蒲线农民自杀逃亡\n    【本报阳城讯】为供应内战军粮，阎锡山军正在同蒲沿线的平遥、介休，灵石、霍县、琪洞、赵城、临汾、襄陵等县，大肆抢粮。从上月初起，阎军即强征麦收后第四次军粮。无数农民纷纷被迫外逃，甚至自杀。洪洞北营村农民张奎福，因交不出三石一斗小麦，遂于上月六日晚，用菜刀砍死其媳妇，自己跳井自杀。在同蒲沿线，阎锡山已公开下命令抢粮。二十二日及驻襄陵之阎军六十六师“爱乡团”召开了第二次抢粮会议，当地粮价立即高涨三倍。侵入平遥东泉地区之阎军三十七师，一周以来，已抢去群众粮食三千余石，四日，阎军四十四师三百余人，在霍县杨枣村一次即抢去农民粮食四十石，仅牛永奎一家，被抢麦子即达十五石。在抢粮中该部阎军发现一藏粮窑洞内有廿余位农民避难，阎军除将粮食五十七石全部抢走外，并用火焚烧，将洞内农民全部烧死。现阎军统治区人民恐慌异常，纷纷逃来解放区谋生，我洪洞民主政府正式成立安抚委员会，筹备土地粮食，给逃出难民安家生产。"

All officers and soldiers of our border region troops express their resolute protest against this unreasonable atrocity. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the military and civilians of the border region made great contributions in terms of manpower, materials, and financial resources to support the front lines, rendering meritorious service to the nation and the people.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the border region troops are actively implementing reorganization and demobilization in accordance with the military reorganization plan adopted by the Political Consultative Conference, and working together with the people of the border region to strive for peaceful construction. However, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have never stopped their blockade and harassment of our border. Since the ceasefire order in January, they have continuously sent aircraft to Yan'an for reconnaissance and harassment, and this time they brazenly carried out bombing, disrupting the peace of our border region's military and civilians and disrupting order, which is a common resentment among the military and civilians of our border region. We fully support the statement made by the spokesperson of the Yan'an Headquarters, demanding that the Kuomintang authorities offer compensation and apology, and we further demand that those who masterminded the bombing of Yan'an be punished.\" Commanders Wang and Yan further stated: \"Our border region's military and civilians are conscious and organized, united as one, and determined to defend China's independence, peace, and democracy, and resolutely defend the peaceful and democratic construction of the border region people.

The income, in addition to covering the family's food and clothing, has a surplus. Zhuang Zhoulou's family engages in spinning, weaving, and cigarette rolling, earning more than 20,000 yuan in six months.

    "content": "Pouring Out Grievances and Turning Themselves Inside Out\n\tPeasants and Landlords Gather to Settle Accounts\n\tJi Fengtong, Teacher at Shahe No. 3 High School, Donates 100 Mu of Land\n\n　　[Report from this newspaper in Wu'an] Tonghui Village was an advanced village during the rent reduction campaign last winter and this spring. In late June, the county committee, in order to deepen the movement, again used Tonghui as a model village for investigation. It was found that although Tonghui Village had experienced a vigorous struggle in the past, the feudal economy still accounted for a large proportion. For example, the land rented out still accounted for 41% (before the rent reduction last winter it accounted for 60%), and the 79 landlords had an average of about seven mu of land each. There were 156 tenant households in the village, renting 2,447 mu of land, accounting for 46% of the cultivated land of the tenant households. There were still 39 extremely poor peasants who had not obtained land, and the average amount of land obtained by peasants was less than 1.7 mu per person. Many backward peasants did not participate in the movement, and their emancipation was not thorough. The arrogance of the evil landlords was still rampant. In June, the heinous landlord Yang Binggong brutally strangled Yang Shunyi's wife, who was actively settling accounts and struggling against him, and threw her body into a well. This massacre further angered and alerted the villagers, who shouted, \"Since the emancipation movement last winter, although we have removed 'Living Yama' Yang Xichang and 'Pale Face' Song Yuming from Tonghui Street, there are still many evil bullies, local despots, and landlords who have not been thoroughly struggled against. Today, they have colluded again to harm our emancipated masses. We must unite tightly and resolutely avenge the death of Shunyi's family! We are not afraid of being slapped by fans, and we are not afraid of being drowned when crossing the river! The struggle must be thorough, and the emancipation must be complete!\" They were brewing within the streets, and activists launched a persuasion movement to mobilize the vast majority of backward peasants. The struggle to thoroughly pour out grievances and settle accounts was universally ignited in Tonghui Village.\n\n　　On July 26, a general meeting was held, and all the peasants poured out their grievances and settled accounts with the 13 large households. Yang Shaoxian, the \"King of the Southwest\" who had been powerful for a lifetime, stood before the masses with his head down, trembling all over as he confessed the details of Yang Binggong, Si Lou, and Qi Lou's families murdering Shunyi's wife. Yang Si Lou and others initially quibbled, but because the evidence was conclusive, they had to admit that they had committed the murder and should bear the responsibility for wearing mourning clothes and handling all the funeral affairs for the deceased. The audience shouted angrily and押(yā)把(bǎ)杀(shā)人(rén)犯(fàn)押(yā)下(xià)去(qù) the murderers were taken away, and the settlement of accounts continued. Liu Longshan, an old man in his sixties, jumped up and said, \"My mind couldn't be opened with a stone before, but now it's like a lock with a key, and it opens with a click!\" The old man's face turned red and green with anger, and he pointed at Qi Lou's face and said, \"In the old society, poor people had no reason, but now the world has changed. Tell everyone, why did you treat us so harshly!\" Old man Yang Heshang squeezed onto the table, saying that he had suffered for most of his life and saw everything clearly. Only when the Eighth Route Army came did the poor have a chance to speak up and have reason.\n\n　　One person followed another, and even the most honest people were eager to speak. One by one, accounts of exploitation and sweat were brought up: Tenant Lao Wangdian was falsely accused by landlord Yang Si Lou of stealing his pumpkins, fined 20 yuan, and his house was searched. Yang Si Lou said, \"It would have been cheaper for you if I had sent you to the blockhouse to be picked by the Japanese.\"\n\n　　Li Mancang, Qiao Erlou, and others caressed the scars burned by the Japanese after being sent there by landlord Song Qinggeng, and cried out their grievances. Widow Liu Quanhe's family said that she had complained that her husband had planted the land for ten years (i.e., half-cropping) and had been exploited for ten years. As soon as her husband died, landlord Hu Xiufeng took back the land! He also confiscated the livestock and carts, and drove her and her four children out of the house. As she spoke, tears streamed down her face. Xing Wenlin, the director of the peasant association, tearfully recounted his past suffering: In famine years, when there was nothing to eat, he went to the fields to find some wild vegetables to eat, but the landlord Song Quanxin said that he had pulled the millet from his field. When he picked some elm leaves from other people's trees, Song Quanxin insisted that he should be punished and said, \"You poor bastards, you live under the sky of Tonghui and stand on the land of Tonghui, how dare you do evil?\" He was driven out of the village. When Xing Wenlin said this, he and his wife couldn't help but cry bitterly. The peasants all recalled their past tragic experiences, and a sob echoed through the meeting place. The peasants asked about each item of grievance, \"Is this true?\" The landlords lowered their heads and said, \"This is true, please forgive us, raise your hands and let us get by.\" The peasants poured out their grievances, letting the sun scorch them mercilessly, without taking a break. Everyone excitedly shouted, \"Let's strike while the iron is hot!\" The meeting continued vigorously until noon the next day, and the peasants resolved to thoroughly pour out their grievances and completely emancipate themselves through this struggle.\n\n(Mu Yue, Zhan Chao, Wu Yun)\n\n　　[Report from this newspaper in Shahe] Ji Fengtong (female), a teacher at Shahe No. 3 High School, was deeply moved after seeing news reports about land donations from various places. In order to promote the rapid realization of \"land to the tiller,\" she specially donated more than 100 mu of her own land to the poor peasants of her village for cultivation, which was deeply welcomed by the villagers.

    "content": "Transportation Construction in Southern Hebei and Taiyue\n　　[This newspaper, Weixian News] With the active efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, Southern Hebei's transportation construction has achieved great success. The total length of highways is 1,615 li. The north-south trunk line runs from Hengshui through Jixian, Nangong, Weixian, Quzhou, Guangping, Daming to Longwangmiao, with a total length of 430 li; the east-west trunk line runs from Gaotang through Xiazhen, Weixian, Wangguantun, Zhangxiaolu, Nanhe to Xingtai, with a total length of 300 li. Secondary branch lines include the section from Handan through Feixiang to Guangping, the section from Handan through Yongnian to Quzhou, the section from Xiazhen to Linqing, the section from Linqing to Wangguantun, the section from @Jin to Xinhe, the section from Baixiang through Yaoshan, Longping, Xingjiawan, Julu to Nangong, the section from Pingxiang through Jize to Quzhou, and the section from Jixian to Zaoqiang, all of which are open to traffic. The central cities of each district, such as Linqing, Weixian, Nangong, Feixiang, and Hengshui, are all well-connected. The Handan Dahua Company's automobile repair factory has set up a bus station in Weixian, the center of Southern Hebei. Civilian passenger cars have been running there since March, and merchants come and go in an endless stream, all praising its convenience. The entire district's telephone system, centered in Weixian, has six trunk lines connecting to each district, with a total length of 890 li. Each district has also repaired many branch lines, totaling 1,853 li, with a total of seven main switchboards and twenty sub-switchboards. At present, mutual contact between various places is becoming increasingly close, which will help the smooth development of the entire region's peaceful construction.\n    Regarding postal services: Postal work has been established in all 43 counties in the region, the trunk lines have been improved, a postal network has been established, the lower levels have been strengthened, the shortcomings of slow service in rural areas compared to cities in the past have been overcome, truly serving the people and ensuring the rapid and accurate distribution of newspapers. Regarding the restoration of the Deshi Railway, since our Southern Hebei Fifth Special Administrative Region and the Central Hebei Sixth Special Administrative Region jointly formed the Deshi Railway Administration Bureau, education of the masses to love and protect the railway has achieved great results, and is currently continuing.\n    The Weihe and Fuhe Rivers in Southern Hebei have always had developed shipping, with tens of thousands of boatmen relying on transportation to maintain their livelihoods. However, in recent years, due to the enemy's division and blockade, and the organization of so-called \"river transportation\" to levy \"commodity taxes\" and \"landing taxes,\" boatmen have lost their jobs. After peace, the democratic government actively restored water conservancy, organized boat loans (Handan loaned out more than 300,000 yuan), and repaired damaged ships. On the Fuyang River, 32 boats have been repaired in Handan, 4 in Hengshui, and 30 in Zhangqiao, all of which are now navigable. Now, from Handan in the south, through Xingjiawan and Hengshui in the middle, to Zhangqiao in the north, a distance of 500 li, boats come and go in an endless stream. The lower reaches of the Fuhe River mostly transport coal, and as of now, the amount transported has reached 300,000 catties. The Grand Canal mainly transports cotton to the north. Many boatmen have not only resumed their livelihoods, but their lives have also improved. According to surveys, each boat takes seven days to travel upstream, carrying at least 30,000 catties; it takes three days to travel downstream, carrying at least 70,000 catties. After deducting the expenses of six or seven people, each boat can earn at least 100,000 yuan. Currently, preparations are being made to enter Tianjin, but there are puppet troops obstructing passage along the way. To protect the safety of transportation, the puppet troops must be disarmed immediately.\n    [This newspaper, Yangcheng News] The Taiyue District has achieved remarkable results in the restoration and construction of highways, railways, and postal services in the past six months: (1) Highway construction. The five major highways of Linfen-Tunliu, Quwo-Gaoping, Jincheng-Yicheng, Jiyuan-Yuanqu, and Yicheng-Jiangxian, with a total length of more than 980 li, have been repaired. The roadbeds of the Lintun Highway (144 kilometers) and the Jinyi Highway (139 kilometers) were repaired in 66 days, and 47 bridges were erected. Due to the lack of transportation, only the Qugao, Jinyi, and Yijiang highways are open to traffic.\n    (2) Railway construction. The Tongpu Railway, from Mengcheng to Shuitou, is 180 li long. Under the unified leadership of the \"Transportation Restoration Committee\" in southern Shanxi and the efforts of the Mengshui section of the Railway Administration Bureau, the entire line has been surveyed and a repair plan has been drafted. However, due to enemy and puppet sabotage, insufficient rails, serious equipment losses, and the vast amount of work required, coupled with the impact of the Kuomintang's expansion of the civil war, work has not yet begun.\n    (3) Postal construction. The Taiyue Postal Administration Bureau has several branch bureaus, 35 county bureaus, and 28 trunk line stations, with five postal trunk lines and 16 branch lines, with a total length of 3,505 li. Significant progress has been made, especially in rural postal work. There are 416 rural postal trunk and branch lines, with a length of approximately 18,855 li, with 135 rural postal stations, 44 agency offices, and 2,511 relay stations distributed along the trunk and branch lines as connecting points, ensuring that postal work has not been hindered in any way in the past six months.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南太岳的交通建设\n\n1946-08-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南太岳的交通建设\n　　【本报威县讯】我冀南交通建设，在党政军民的积极努力下，已获巨大成绩。公路全长一千六百一十五华里，南北干线由衡水经冀县、南宫、威县、曲周、广平、大名至龙王庙，全长四百三十华里；东西干线由高唐经夏津、威县、王官屯、张销鹿、南和至邢台，全长三百华里。其次各支路由邯郸经肥乡至广平段，由邯郸经永年至曲周段，由夏津至临清段，由临清至王官屯段，由＠晋至新河段，由柏乡经尧山、隆平、邢家湾、巨鹿至南宫段，由平乡经鸡泽至曲周段，由冀县至枣强段均已通车。各分区中心城市临清、威县、南宫、肥乡、衡水等均四通八达。邯郸大华公司汽车修理厂，已于冀南中心威县设立汽车站，该处民用客车早于三月间通行，客商来往不绝，莫不称便。全区电话以威县为中心有六条干线通各分区，全长八百九十华里。各个区亦各修好很多支线，共长一千八百五十三华里，共设总机七部，分电机二十部。目前各地互相联系日益密切，这将有助于全区和平建设事业的顺利发展。\n    邮政方面：邮务工作现全区四十三县均建立，改进了干线，设立了邮线网，加强了下层，克服了过去城市快农村慢的缺点，真正作到为人民服务并保证了报纸发行迅速准确。关于德石铁路的恢复，自我冀南五专署与冀中六专署联合组成德石路管理局，教育群众爱路护路等工作已获得很大成绩，现仍继续开展中。\n    冀南卫河、滏河历来航运发达，多少万船夫依靠运输维持生活，但这几年来由于敌人的分割封锁，又组织所谓“河运”抽征“百货税”“落地税”等，以至船夫失业。和平后民主政府积极恢复水利组织船贷款（邯郸贷出三十余万元），修理残破船只，滏阳河上现已修好船只邯郸有三十二只，衡水有四只，张桥有三十只，均已通航。现南起邯郸，中经邢家湾、衡水，北至张桥、五百里的滏阳河面上，船只上下络绎不绝。滏河下运多是煤炭，截至目前运数已达卅万斤。运河北运棉花为主，许多船夫不但复业，生活也得到改善，据调查每只船上水七天走到，载重最少三万斤；下水三天走到，载重最少七万斤，除去六、七天人的开消，每船至少可赚十余万元。目下准备入津，惟中途有伪军阻碍通行，为保护运输安全，必须立即解除伪军武装。\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳区半年来在公路、铁路、邮政三大工作的恢复与建设上成绩显著：（一）公路建设。修复了共长九百八十余华里的临汾屯留、曲沃高平、晋城翼城、济源垣曲、翼城绛县等五大公路。临屯公路（一百四十四公里）与晋翼公路（一百三十九公里）的路基，于六十六天内修复，并架设桥梁四十七座。因交通工具缺乏，只有曲高、晋翼、翼绛三条公路通车。\n    （二）铁路建设。同蒲线蒙城至水头段全长一百八十华里。由在晋南“恢复交通委员会”统一领导及蒙水段铁路管理局努力下，已全部勘察完竣，并拟就修复计划，只因敌伪破坏，路轨不足，器材损失严重，需工浩大，加以国民党扩大内战行为影响兴修，至今未能动工。\n    （三）邮政建设。太岳邮务管理局下设几个分局，三十五个县局，二十八个干线站，邮寄干线五条，支线十六条，全长三千五百零五里。特别在乡村邮寄工作上成绩显著。乡邮干支线共有四百一十六条，长约一万八千八百五十五里，其间有乡邮站一百三十五个，代办所四十四个，转递站二千五百一十一个，分布在干支线上，作为连络点，使半年来邮寄工作未受任何阻碍。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Due to the resolute self-defense of the military and civilians in various liberated areas, the Kuomintang army's offensives in Suwan, Central Plains, Shandong, Shanxi and other places have continued to suffer setbacks in the past ten days. Since July, the invaders have lost approximately 100,000 in manpower. The Kuomintang army's reserves have been almost exhausted, and they are now using parachute troops and youth armies to fill the gaps near the front lines. However, the Chiang Kai-shek war group has not yet learned an appropriate lesson from this large-scale civil war that has lasted for more than a month. Chen Cheng publicly declared that he would take the \"last resort\" and engage in a \"military showdown\" with the CCP. Chiang ordered all troops to \"attack and annihilate the CCP troops with all their strength without waiting for orders\" (this order was captured by the Eighth Route Army in a battle near Wenxi). They are expanding the war to more areas. At the end of June and the beginning of July, they took advantage of the Shang'anping incident to launch offensives against Xianghe and Sanhe, opening up the Jidong battlefield, and planned to attack Rehe. At the same time, they bombed Yan'an with eight planes, further provoking the CCP and the people of the whole country.\n\nSuwan Area: Kuomintang army casualties and prisoners of war have reached more than 28,000, equivalent to the entire strength of four divisions of the Kuomintang army. The weapons captured by the New Fourth Army in the area can equip three American-equipped divisions. The Kuomintang army advancing northward along the river has made no progress along the Yangzhou-Taizhou line. On the Taixing-Rugao line, the Kuomintang army's offensive stagnated for a time due to serious losses of 20,000 men. After adjustments and replenishment, they concentrated seven divisions from Rugao to the north and Jiangyan to the east on the 30th of last month, and pounced on Haian Town. After inflicting more than 3,000 casualties on the invaders, the New Fourth Army withdrew from the town on the 2nd of this month. The Kuomintang army is continuing to invade Dongtai. The Fifth Army, which occupied Tianchang in the west, made little progress in attacking Xuyi. The New Fourth Army on the west line of Huaibei launched a powerful counterattack, restoring Baishan Town on the Su (County)-Yong (Cheng) highway and Baiyiji, northwest of Su County. On the east line of Huaibei, Lutuan Town east of Jiagou was restored, and the Kuomintang army that had invaded southeastward from Jiagou was defeated in the Shuanggou area. On the north line of Suwan, the 92nd Division (now renamed the 92nd Brigade) of the Kuomintang army was completely wiped out in Yugou. The Kuomintang army, which invaded along the Longhai Railway, attempted to join forces from Xuzhou and Haizhou in the east and west, cutting off the connection between the Suwan and Shandong liberated areas, but ultimately failed. The New Fourth Army also recovered dozens of villages and towns between Xinpu and Haizhou. At the moment Chiang is again increasing troops from the west line of Longhai to Xuzhou, determined to invade, fierce battles are expected soon on the north line of Suwan. In the rear of the Kuomintang army-occupied areas, local militias and local armed forces have launched guerrilla warfare, closely cooperating with the main forces, attacking, harassing, and killing the invaders, and have recovered many villages and towns. One day, the Rugao local armed forces intercepted 400 boxes of ammunition in a surprise attack.\n\nShandong Area: The Kuomintang army's attempt to open the Jiaoji Railway has made no progress. The 54th Army, which invaded west of Jiaoxian in the east, retreated to its original position after two battalions were annihilated in Zhilanzhuang. The 73rd Army of the Kuomintang army, which invaded the Zibo area in the central section, is building strongholds in Xipo Town and was attacked by the Eighth Route Army, annihilating one of its battalions and recovering the town. In the west section, after the 12th Army of the Kuomintang army occupied Jiyang City, sixty miles northeast of Jinan, it was strongly counterattacked by the Bohai Eighth Route Army. After changing hands twice, the Eighth Route Army finally recovered the city again on the 25th of last month. The Kuomintang army deeply felt the lack of troops in Shandong and recently transported more than a thousand unarmed soldiers from the youth army who were to be demobilized in the Central Plains to Qingdao. They will be equipped by the United States and put into battle.\n\nJinchaji and Rehe Areas: Since the Chiang-American army created the Anping Town incident on the 29th of last month, at the beginning of this month the Kuomintang army has invaded the Xianghe and Sanhe liberated areas from three directions: Tongzhou, Anping, and Hexiwu. The 94th Army of the Kuomintang army in the northern route of the eastern line has also been dispatched frequently, attempting to attack Ninghe. The Kuomintang armies of various routes have been effectively resisted by the Jidong Eighth Route Army and the militia, and are currently in a standoff. Rehe, which is closely related to Jidong, since the American army sent the 53rd Army of the Kuomintang army to the Qinhuangdao-Jinzhou line, the Kuomintang army is now planning to attack Gubeikou, Chengde, and Chifeng. There has already been fierce fighting along the Ye (Baishou)-Chi (Feng) line.\n\nShanxi Area: The important towns of Huairen and Kouquan on the Tongpu Railway in northern Jin have been liberated by the Eighth Route Army in self-defense counterattacks, annihilating more than 1,000 puppet troops. So far, nearly 600 miles of the Tongpu north line from north of Xinxian to south of Huairen has no trace of the enemy or puppets. In the areas of the Jinzhong Plain occupied by Yan's army, mass guerrillas and militia actively cooperated in the battle, and successively removed many newly built important strongholds of Yan's puppet army in Xiaqu, Jicheng, Boyong, Sanquan, Luocheng, and Kangning Fort under the jurisdiction of Fenyang and Wenshui counties. In the southern section of the Tongpu line, the Kuomintang army concentrated four divisions and continued to reinforce two divisions, preparing to continue their northward offensive. After a month of heroic self-defense by the military and civilians in southern Jin, most of the occupied areas have been recovered. The entire line and more than 100 villages and towns on both sides from Maojindu to Zhangdian have been restored, except for Zhangdian. In the southern section of the Tongpu line, the 60-mile line from Dongzhen via Houma to Gaoxian is still being defended by the Eighth Route Army.\n\nLi Xiannian's Breakthrough Troops in the Central Plains: The Pi Dingjun Brigade, which advanced eastward, has safely arrived in the Suwan liberated area. The people's armed forces stationed in western Anhui and eastern Hubei will continue to adhere to self-defense and resistance, and continue to fight bloody battles with those who are encircling and annihilating them. The main force advancing westward shattered the Kuomintang army's nine encirclements and blockades along the way, and has arrived in the mountainous border area of Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei. Due to the iron unity and heroic combat of the people's armed forces, coupled with the care and assistance of the people along the way, despite long marches and multiple battles, they still maintain their original equipment and numbers, with very few losses. The unjust pursuers – the Kuomintang army – have suffered many deserters due to war-weariness, exhaustion, hunger, and popular opposition. Chiang Kai-shek deeply feels that Li Xiannian's troops after the breakthrough have restrained many of his civil war forces, and has transferred forces from other places to continue the \"encirclement and annihilation,\" and fierce battles are about to unfold.\n\nIn addition, the Eighth Route Army in the Jiluyu area eliminated the 15,000-strong puppet army of Pang Changzhong and others, who were entrenched in Gaotang. Gaotang County and its entire territory were liberated. At the same time, the Kuomintang puppet army, which occupied the Meng County area in northern Henan after the ceasefire order, launched an offensive against the liberated area with aircraft cover at the beginning of this month. The Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, annihilating more than 3,000 people. The Kuomintang army's bridgehead fortresses on the north bank of the Yellow River – Qiaotou, Dongzhai, Dianshang, and Zhishu and other important towns – have been removed by the Eighth Route Army, lifting the threat to Mengcheng and Jiyuan, which is also a major victory in the self-defense war during this period.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各解放区我军民坚决自卫七月以来进犯军损失十万\n\n1946-08-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各解放区我军民坚决自卫七月以来进犯军损失十万\n    【新华社延安十日电】由于各解放区军民坚决自卫，过去十日中蒋军在苏皖、中原、山东、山西等地之进攻，继续遭受顿挫。自七月以来，进犯者已损失有生力量十万人左右。蒋军后备罗掘殆尽，现正动用降落伞部队及青年军以补接近前线的空虚。但蒋介石好战集团，尚不能在这一个多月的大规模内战中，求得适当的教训。陈诚公开宣称：要走“下策”与中共进行“武力决赛”，蒋命令各部队“对中共部队，应不待命令乘机以全力攻击而歼灭之”（该命令已在闻喜附近战斗中被八路军缴获）。他们正将战争扩展至更多地区。六月底七月初，借上安平事件，向香河、三河进攻，开辟冀东战场，并布置进攻热河。同时以飞机八架轰炸延安，向中共和全国人民进一步挑衅。\n    苏皖方面：蒋军伤亡与被俘官兵已达二万八千余人，约等于蒋军四个师的全部兵力。该地新四军所缴获武器，可装备三个美械师。沿江向北进犯之蒋军，其扬州、泰州一线始终无进展，泰兴如皋一线，蒋军因受二万人的严重损耗，攻势一度停滞。经过调整补充后，上月三十日起又集中七个师，自如皋向北，姜堰向东，猛扑海安镇，新四军予进犯者以三千余人之杀伤后，于本月二日撤离该镇。蒋军正继续进犯东台。其西面侵占天长之第五军，图攻盱眙进展甚微。苏皖西线新四军施行有力反击，淮北路西恢复宿（县）永（城）公路上的百善镇，与宿县西北之白义集。淮北路东恢复夹沟以东之路疃镇，击溃由夹沟向东南出犯之蒋军于双沟地区。苏皖北线，蒋军九十二师（现改称九十二旅）于渔沟全部覆没。其沿陇海路出犯之蒋军，企图由徐州、海州东西会合，切断苏皖与山东两大解放区的联络，终未得逞，新四军并收复新浦、海州间村镇数十处，刻蒋又从陇海西线增兵徐州，坚心进犯，苏皖北线不日激战。在蒋军侵占区后方，各地民兵与地方武装已展开游击战争，与主力部队密切配合，袭击困扰杀伤进犯者，并已收复村镇多处。一日如皋地方武装以奇袭截获弹药四百箱。\n    山东方面：蒋军企图打通胶济路无进展，东段至胶县西犯之五十四军，在芝兰庄被歼两营后退回原地，中段侵入淄博区之蒋军七十三军，正在西坡镇修筑据点，遭八路军奇袭，歼灭其一个营，并收复该镇。西段蒋军十二军，自侵占济南东北六十里之济阳城后，即遭渤海八路军有力反击，经过两度易手，八路军终于上月二十五日再度恢复该城。蒋军深感山东兵力不足，近又续运青年军两个师之中原拟复员之千余徒手兵抵青，将由美方装备投入战斗。\n    晋察冀与热河方面：自上月二十九日蒋美军制造安平镇事件后，本月初蒋军即从通州、安平、河西务三方面，进犯香河、三河解放区，东线北路蒋军九十四军亦纷纷出动，图攻宁河。各路蒋军已遭冀东八路军与民兵有力阻击，正对峙中。与冀东密切关联之热河，自美军将蒋军五十三军送至秦皇岛锦州一线后，现蒋军正在布置进攻古北口、承德、赤峰，叶（柏寿）赤（峰）沿线已有激战。\n    山西方面：晋北同蒲路重要城镇怀仁、口泉两地，已为该地八路军在自卫反击中解放，歼灭伪军千余人，至此忻县以北怀仁以南近六百里之同蒲北线，已无敌伪踪迹。晋中平川被阎军侵占地区，群众游击队和民兵积极配合作战，先后拔除汾阳文水等县属之下曲、冀城、渤永、三泉、罗城、康宁堡等阎伪军新建重要据点多处。同蒲线南段，蒋军集中四个师并续增援两个师，准备继续北犯，晋南军民经一月来英勇自卫，已恢复大部被占地区。其由茅津渡至张店一线，除张店以外，全线及两旁村镇百余处均已恢复。同蒲南段，从东镇经侯马至高县六十里一线，仍在八路军坚守中。\n    中原李先念突围部队：其东进之皮定钧旅已安全抵达苏皖解放区，留守皖西及鄂东之人民武装，仍将坚持自卫抗击，与围歼者继续血战。其西进主力沿途粉碎蒋军九次围歼与堵击，业已抵达多山之陕豫鄂边。由于人民武装铁的团结与英勇善战，加之沿途人民的爱护帮助，虽经长途行军与多次战斗，仍保持原有之装备与人数，损失甚微。而不义之追击者——蒋军，因厌战疲惫饥饿与人民反对，逃亡甚众。蒋介石深感突围后之李先念部牵制了他的许多内战兵力，已从其他地方上抽调兵力继续“围歼”，即将展开激战。\n    此外，冀鲁豫地区八路军铲除盘踞高唐伪军庞长中等部万五千人，高唐县城及其全境获得解放。同时，停战令后侵占豫北孟县地区之蒋伪军，于本月初以飞机掩护向解放区进攻，八路军被迫自卫，将其歼灭三千余人。蒋军黄河北岸之桥头堡垒——桥头、东寨、店上、治戍等重镇，已经被八路军拔除，解除了对孟城、济源的威胁，亦为此一时期自卫战中之一大胜利。"

    "content": "The \"Persuasion Movement\" in Tonghui Village\n　　Mu Yue, Zhan Chao\n\n　　I. Active Elements Propose a \"Persuasion Movement\"\n\n　　In late June, Wu Yun, a leading cadre from Wu'an County, went to the countryside to inspect the mass movement. Comrade Wu arrived at Tonghui Village in the Third District. This village was one of the most advanced villages in the entire county. The village cadres told Comrade Wu, \"The masses in our village have basically turned themselves over!\" They also cited many examples of wasteland in the village that no one wanted, proving that the emancipation movement was going well. While listening to the cadres' opinions, Comrade Wu began to conduct a detailed investigation. The results showed that out of the 310 peasant households in the village, 39 still had no land, and more than 50 peasant households had only one or two mu of bad land per person, which was not enough to maintain their livelihoods. One-third of the peasants had not been truly mobilized, and organized peasants accounted for only 40% of the total. Comrade Wu used these concrete facts to get the cadres and activists to see the situation clearly. Everyone said, \"No wonder the masses are dissatisfied with us. We thought that the masses had turned themselves over just because we had. That's not right!\" They also examined the past and found that it was wrong to say that all those who did not want land were the lonely and widowed. In fact, as long as the backward masses were helped to understand, some of the lonely and widowed would still be willing to take land. During this period, it was also discovered that landlords Yang Binggong, Yang Silou, Yang Qilou, etc., had strangled the wife of Yang Shunyi, who was settling accounts, and thrown her into a well. This greatly shocked all the cadres and activists, who realized that only when everyone had turned themselves over could it be considered a true emancipation. They were determined to bring all the masses along and launched a \"persuasion movement\" targeting the backward elements.\n\n　　II. Running into Walls\n\n　　At the beginning, the tenth street leader and group leader raised difficulties, saying that there were particularly many backward elements in his street, and they were all old men and women who could not be persuaded. They themselves also still had \"nice guy\" ideas and were unwilling to offend people. Everyone first helped them to understand the situation, and then went separately to mobilize and persuade the backward masses.\n\n　　Old man Liu Longshan said, \"Alas! 'A small man's fate is determined by the Heavenly Official, no matter how hard you try, it's useless!' (meaning: even if you move, it won't work). When I was helpless for the first two years, I wasn't sick. Later, after I had just made a few business trips, I was sick for half a year, and even lost all my capital!\" The cadres and activists gave him an example, saying that Du Heting's wife was dying of sweating sickness, and Heting settled accounts and got back two strings of courtyards and twenty-four mu of land, and his wife's illness was also cured. But Liu Longshan shook his head and said, \"Alas, it's just that people were not supposed to die! ... I'm not a three-year-old child, why do I need you to tell me to turn myself over!\" The village chief went to persuade the old man Yang Wenqing, who sold malt sugar. The old man said, \"Baoshan, I know that you are doing this for me to have land to cultivate, a house to live in, and to live a good life. But, you see, what you said is all in vain. I have been a good person all my life, and I am not going to offend people at the end of my life! It's okay for you to tell me this, but don't tell it to others. People will say: 'The village cadres are just causing trouble,' that wouldn't be good!\" ...\n\n　　The cadres and activists did not lose heart when they encountered this situation. They came up with a way to break through a few typical cases first.\n\n　　III. Old Granny Yang Complains\n\n　　In the past, there were more than 500 households in Tonghui Village, and the Yang family accounted for more than 300 of them. Among them, Yang Qide's wife was the oldest. She complained at the meeting of backward elements in the eighth and ninth street base points, saying, \"The Yang family is the oldest, and I have suffered the most oppression! I am a lonely old woman, with no land to cultivate, no firewood to burn. I went to the Yang family ancestral hall to take two pieces of firewood to burn, and Yang Xichang and Yang Yuchang drove me out like pigs and dogs, and even scolded me! An old woman in her seventies or eighties was still sent to Boyan to build a factory for the Japanese! ... This is what my good grandsons did!\" \"In the past, I always felt that they were all young people, so let it be! Who would pay attention to you! Today I thought about it, and I can't not settle the accounts.\" These words struck the hearts of a group of old men and women. Yang Wenqing, the old man who sold malt sugar, said, \"Seventh Granny is right. A rich man's grandson becomes a grandpa, and a poor man's grandpa becomes a grandson!\" Seventh Granny continued, \"At first, when I saw the traitors Yang Xichang (nicknamed 'Living Yama') and Song Yumin (nicknamed 'Big White Face') being shot, I felt a little pitiful. Now I think they should have been shot long ago. Keeping them sitting at home, eating and drinking well, all day long planning to be mean to us helpless households?! If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, and Yang Xichang and his gang were still in charge, the poor people in Tonghui Street would have died almost all! This time, I must settle accounts and turn myself over thoroughly!\" Everyone listened and praised: Seventh Granny is right.\n\n　　Yang Wenxi, the old man who never opened his mouth, poured out the suffering of being oppressed by the Yang family landlords in a thorough and satisfying manner, and said, \"We are still afraid of offending people? The rich man cursed the farmers' association and cursed us along with it! Their boundaries are clearly defined, and we must also draw them clearly. When two countries are at war, the Yellow River is the boundary! We didn't provoke him, but he provoked us first!\" He also said, \"I've figured it out, it's useless to be afraid of 'the sky changing' and not settling accounts. Chiang Kai-shek still cares whether you settle accounts or not. If you don't settle accounts, he will still kill you.\" Militia member Zhang Shuanghuo, seeing that the old people were more understanding than himself, stood up anxiously and embarrassedly, and after examining his own backward thinking caused by \"sentimentality,\" he said, \"I'm not afraid of being fanned by a fan even if I break my head! I'm not afraid of being drowned in a flood when crossing the river! This time, I can't give them one less account.\" At this time, twenty or thirty people all shouted. Later, when talking about active and backward elements, some people were envious and unfair: \"The more Yue Wuchang turns himself over, the better he lives and the more he is praised. The more we don't want to turn ourselves over, the poorer we get, and we also end up as 'backward elements'. We'll turn ourselves over this time and show them.\" After hearing what militia member Zhang Shuanghuo said, an old man still hesitated a little, but old Liu Longshan said, \"Have the village cadres been saying all along that we can't listen to anything? In fact, settling accounts is not for ourselves!\" The old man nodded and said, \"That's right. Our brains are not as firm as young people's, let's wait and see!\" The village chief said, \"You just wait and see. Whenever you feel that you should make suggestions or settle accounts, just do it, don't miss the opportunity.\"\n\n　　IV. Backward Elements Take the Lead\n\n　　The next day (July 26), a meeting was held to struggle against the thirteen major households, and everyone was very energetic. The hegemonic landlords such as \"Southwest King\" Yang Shaoxian were so frightened that they trembled. Many of the people who said \"let's wait and see\" the night before spoke up, and even took the lead. Even Yang Heshang, who had gone crazy with grief over the death of his son, was back in action. \"Wait, I want to settle accounts with the Qilou family!\" He said, jumping onto the table and waving his arms, \"I started working as a hired hand when I was thirteen, and I'm sixty-four this year, and I still don't have a clod of land or a room! The suffering I've suffered from the landlord Yang Qilou's family alone is endless. I have to grind grain, carry water, and carry coal for them even when I'm farming for them. That new courtyard of the landlord's family was also built by me for free. I've suffered for most of my life, what am I waiting for if I don't turn myself over now?\" Old Yang Longxi gesticulated and said, \"I couldn't open my mind with a stone before, but now it's like a lock with a key, and it opens with a click!\" ... According to statistics after the meeting, more than 30 of the 80-plus complainants were past backward elements.\n\n　　V. \"Who Doesn't Have a Problem!\"\n\n　　After holding big meetings and small meetings, and settling big accounts and small accounts, even on the day before the end of the accounting, near the end of the meeting, tenant Du Fulai raised a question. Everyone asked him why he hadn't raised his opinion earlier, and he said that it had never been his turn to speak. It was extremely difficult for him to raise this opinion. He thought about it again and again, not knowing how to say it appropriately? He also didn't know whether to settle accounts with the landlords who were not at home? Several times he almost figured it out, but the meeting was over! Today, seeing that the accounting was coming to an end, he mustered up the courage to raise it, and the cadres immediately encouraged him, and Du Fulai brought up all his opinions about the four landlords. Even when it came to distributing the fruits of the struggle, some people still raised the issue of settling accounts. For example, Xue Laoju's wife didn't participate in the accounting at night, and only arrived when the fruits of the landlord Yang Laokui were being distributed. After being persuaded by the cadres and the masses, she also got some things. Gao Fugui, who was the most backward in the past, also wanted to settle accounts. Others asked him, \"Didn't you say you didn't have a problem?\" He said, \"Who doesn't have a problem in the old society!\" The cadres said, \"Raise it if you have a problem,\" and the masses said, \"Raise it.\" In this way, the place where the fruits were distributed often naturally turned into a temporary complaining meeting, and many old men and women spoke freely in this kind of occasion.\n\n　　VI. The Vagrant Wants Land\n\n　　In order to achieve \"the tiller has his own land,\" the fruits of this struggle were first distributed to the masses in the form of land and houses. On August 4, after the \"Turnover and Account Settlement Committee\" of the village checked the results, it was found that except for a few elderly people who had no labor force and wanted to find other ways, there was still one household without land, not because it had not been allocated, but because he did not want it. This man was called Hu Fuke, and he was very poor, but he didn't want land. Because he used to be a vagrant son, and he had squandered his family property by gambling! Later, he made a living by carrying water and begging for food. He drank a few cups of wine when he had some money, and went to beg for food when he woke up and had nothing to eat. Moreover, he also knew that \"the Eighth Route Army won't let anyone starve to death,\" so he was very satisfied with his current life. After studying the reasons why Hu Fuke didn't want land, at the end of the accounting, he was invited to the meeting place, and everyone helped him to understand the situation and persuaded him: \"You can't just rely on others for food in the future, you have to produce and get rich and live a good life.\" He admitted on the spot that he wanted five mu of land, but he didn't want it again after he went down. When the meeting was held at night to clear the accounts, Hu Fuke came again. He said, \"It's not a solution to just rely on others for food.\" He also understood, but he had never cultivated land before. The cadres and activists knew that he was afraid that he would be caught as a lazy man if he couldn't cultivate it later, so they reduced it by two mu, leaving him with three mu of land, which he wanted. Everyone said, \"Even Hu Fuke knows to want land, this time our Tonghui Street has turned over well.\"\n\n　　VII. Everyone is Happy\n\n　　The past backward elements were all involved in the complaining and accounting movement this time. Even four or five old people who could not move compared the past with the present. Yang Chenshi's wife, who was eighty-four years old, said, \"I know it in my heart! The bailiffs in the past only knew how to collect grain and money, but our Eighth Route Army's bailiffs only know how to let everyone live a good life. When we old people can't move, they carry rice and flour to our house. ... I am really satisfied with this time, and I will say a good word to the King of Hell when I die.\" Yang Jinzhou's wife, who was the same age as her, couldn't get up when she sat down. When fighting against the thirteen major households, she had to be helped to listen to the meeting. Yang Chongcai, the oldest old man in the village, had to personally receive the fruits of the struggle. When he was walking back, his toothless mouth laughed and said, \"I'm eighty-six this year, and I've been oppressed by others, I don't know if there is today.\" He waved the package in his hand and said, \"Is this our thing? This time we got it back.\" Others asked him why he was still carrying a broom, she said, \"Sweep it all away! Sweep away all the injustices of the past,\" which made everyone laugh.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 同会村的“劝说运动”\n慕岳　展潮\n1946-08-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　同会村的“劝说运动”\n    慕岳　展潮\n    一、积极分子提出“劝说运动”\n    六月下旬，武安县领导干部下乡检查群众运动，吴云同志到了三区同会村。这村是全县几个先进村之一，村干部们向吴同志说：“俺村群众翻身都翻得差不多了！”还举了全村很多荒地没人要的例子，证明翻身运动搞得不错。吴同志一面听取干部意见，一面着手进行细密的调查研究，结果发现全村三百一十户农民里面，还有三十九户没有地，五十多户农民每人只有一二亩坏地，不够维持生活；三分之一的农民还没有真正发动起来，有组织的农民只占全体百分之四十。吴同志以这些具体事实打通了干部积极分子的思想。都说：“怨不得群众不满意咱，咱自己翻了身就以为群众也翻了身，这可不对！”并检讨出过去说不要地的全是孤寡户是不对的，其实只要帮助落后群众打通思想，有些孤寡也还是愿意要地。在这时期又发现了地主杨炳功、杨四楼、杨七楼等，把算账群众杨顺义老婆勒死投井的事，更大大地震动了全体干部和积极分子，认识到只有大伙都翻了身，才算是真翻身。决心把全体群众都带起来。便开展了一个对落后分子的“劝说运动”。\n    二、碰钉子\n    一开头十街街长、组长就提出困难，说他街的落后分子特别多，而且都是些老汉和娘们，怎也说不动。他们自己也还有“老好人”想法，不愿得罪人，大伙便首先帮助他们打通了思想，然后分头去动员劝说落后群众。\n    老汉刘龙山说：“唉！‘小人命，天官定，刚巴叉，不管用’！（大意：就是动一动，也不中用），头二年俺没法的时候也没病，后来刚倒腾了几趟生意就病了半年，连老本都赔净啦！”干部、积极分子便举了个例子跟他说，杜河廷老婆害汗病快死了，河廷算账要回两串院子、二十四亩地，老婆病也好了。刘龙山却摇摇头说：“唉，人家命里不该死嘛！………俺又不是三岁小孩，要翻身还用得着你们说啦！”村长去劝说卖麻糖的老汉杨文庆，老汉说：“保山，你们为着俺有地种、有房子住，过好时光，俺都知道。不过呀，你讲的话都白搭了。俺当了一辈子好人，临死还去惹人落后赖！？你这话跟俺说说还没关系，可不要再跟旁人说啦。叫人家都说：‘村干部净惹事生非’，多不好！”………\n    干部积极分子遇到这种情形，并没有灰心，他们想了个办法，先突破几个典型。\n    三、杨家老奶奶诉苦\n    全同会村过去共有五百多户，光杨家就占了三百多户，其中数杨七德老婆辈数最大，她在八九十街基点的落后分子会上诉苦说：“杨家数俺辈数大，也数俺最受苛制！俺孤寡老婆一个人，没地种，没柴烧，到杨家祠堂里拿两片柴烧，叫杨锡昌、杨育昌赶猪赶狗一样赶出来，还骂了一顿！七八十的老婆子还要派去伯延给日本修工！……这就是俺好孙子们办的事呀！”“过去俺总觉得都是小辈，算了吧！人家谁还搭理你这个哩！今天想了想，可不能不算算账了。”这些话都打到一帮老汉老婆们的心坎上。卖麻糖老汉杨文庆说：“七奶奶说得对，有钱人孙子变成爷，没钱人爷爷堕成孙子啦！”七奶奶接着说：“俺起先看见枪毙汉奸杨锡昌（外号‘活阎王’）、宋裕民（外号‘大白脸’），还觉得有点可怜。现在想早就该蹦他了，留着他们坐在家里，吃好喝好，成天盘算刻薄咱没法户？！要不是八路军过来，还叫杨锡昌那伙人当家，咱同会街穷人早死的差不多啦！这回俺一定要算账翻透身！”大伙听了，都称赞：七奶奶理说的到。\n    永不张嘴的杨文喜老头子，痛快淋漓的诉完杨家地主压迫他的苦，又说：“咱还怕惹人吗，老财骂农会就捎带骂了咱！人家界限划得清格格的，咱也要划清楚些，两国交兵黄河为界！咱没惹他，他先惹咱！”还说：“我可想通了，怕‘变天’不算账也不中用，老蒋还管你算账不算账，你不算账，他也要杀你。”民兵张双货看到老人们比自己都通达，又羞又急地抢着站起来，检讨了自己因“情面”而产生的落后思想以后说：“打破头皮不怕扇子扇！过河不怕大水淹！这回算账少给一个都不行。”这时候，二、三十个人就都嚷嚷起来了。后来谈到积极和落后分子问题，有人又羡慕又不平：“人家岳武昌越翻身越好过越受表扬，咱越不想翻身越受穷，还落个‘落后分子’，咱这次翻身给他们看看。”一个老汉听罢民兵张双货的话，还觉得有点迟疑，老刘龙山却说：“村干部一直说咱们就一点听不进去？其实，算算还不是为了咱自己！”那个老汉点头表示：“说起来也就是。咱脑筋总没有年青人坚决，走着瞧吧！”村长说：“你们就走着瞧吧，啥时候觉得该提意见、该算账，就提就算，不要错过了机会。”\n    四、落后分子打头阵\n    第二天（七月二十六日），开会斗争十三大户，大伙劲头很足。吓得“西南王”杨绍先等恶霸地主直抖擞。头天黑夜说“走着瞧吧”的人，很多都讲话了，并且还打了头阵，连死了儿子急疯了的杨和尚，也重新上阵了。“等等，俺要跟七楼家算账”！他说着便跳到桌子上，摆动着手臂说：“我十三岁开始当小长工，今年六十四岁了，还是地无一垅、房无一间！光受地主杨七楼家的苦，就诉也诉不尽，大种地还得给人家推磨、挑水、担炭，地主那串新院子也都是俺白出工修起的。受了多半辈子苦，现在不翻身还等到啥时候？”老杨龙喜指手划脚说：“我早先脑筋用石头也砸不开，现在就跟锁子有了钥匙，咯巴一下就开了！”。……会后统计，八十多诉苦人中，有三十多个是过去的落后分子。\n    五、“谁还没有个问题咧！”\n    开罢大会、开小会，算罢大账、算小账，一直到算账结束的前一天，快散会的时候，佃户杜福来才提问题，大伙问他为啥有意见早不提，他说一直轮不上自己说话。他提这意见实在困难极了，想了又想，不知道该怎个说法才合适？又不知道叫不叫向不在家的地主算账？好几次都是想得差不多，又散会了！今天眼看算账快要结束，才鼓着勇气提，干部们马上鼓励他，杜福来便把对四家地主的意见，全提出来了。一直到分配斗争果实的时候，还有人提出来要算账，例如薛老巨老婆吧，夜里没参加算账，分配地主杨老奎果实才赶到，经过干部和群众说通，也分了些东西。过去最落后的高富贵也要算账了，旁人问他：“你不是说没有问题？”他说：“在旧社会里谁还没有个问题咧！”干部说：“既有问题提吧”，群众说：“提吧”，这样子，分配果实的地方，往往很自然便变成临时的诉苦会，许多老汉老婆们都在这种场合里无拘束地讲话。\n    六、浪荡汉要地了\n    为了达到“耕者有其田”，这次分配斗争果实，首先分配土地和房子给群众。八月四日经村里“翻身算账委员会”检查结果，除几家毫无劳力另想办法的老人外，还有一户没有土地，并不是没有分配到，而是他不要。这人叫胡福科，家很穷，却不要地。因为他过去是个浪荡公子出身，抽料面把家产都踢踏光了！后来就靠挑水要饭为生，有了几个钱就饱喝几杯酒，醒来没吃的便去讨饭，而且他还知道“八路军不让饿死一个人”，所以便很满足于现在这样的生活。研究了胡福科不要地的原因，算账到最后，便把他请到会场上来，大伙一起帮助他打通思想，劝说道：“以后不能光靠别人吃饭，要生产发家过好时光”，他当场承认要五亩地，下去却又不要了。晚间开会清账的时候，胡福科又来了，他说：“光靠别人吃饭不是办法”，他也是想通了，就是早先没有种过地，干部积极分子知道他怕过后种不了捉他懒汉，便减少二亩给他留下三亩地，他要了。大伙说：“连胡福科都知道要地，咱同会街这回翻身可算是翻好了。”\n    七、皆大欢喜\n    过去的落后分子这次全卷入诉苦算账运动里来了。就连四五个不能动弹的老人，都把时光作了个对比，八十四岁的杨辰时老婆说：“我心肝眼里知道！早先当保长的光知道要粮要款，咱八路军的保长，光知道叫大家过好时光。咱老得不能动弹，到时候又是米又是面扛到俺家。………这时光俺真是心满意足了，死了也要跟阎王爷说个好。”与她同岁的杨金州老婆，坐下起不来，斗争十三大户时，还要人搀她去听会；全村年纪最大的老汉杨重财，非亲自去领斗争果实不可，他往回走时，他那张无牙的嘴，笑哈哈地说：“俺今年八十六啦，受人家苛刻，不知道还有今天”，他舞着手里的包袱说：“这是咱的东西？这回要回来了”，旁人问他为什么还拿把扫帚，她说：“一扫光！把过去不公的事一扫光”，引得大伙都笑了。"

The directive praised the practice in some areas of arranging for airing grievances while engaging in production during the day, holding meetings at night to resolve problems, and promptly distributing unmanaged land to poor farmers to boost the masses' enthusiasm for production and deepen the land reform movement. At the same time, it pointed out that the serious phenomena of neglecting production in favor of mass movements, ignoring the distribution of barren land, and failing to quickly achieve the fruits of struggle, thereby hindering production, should be overcome immediately. (1) Grasp the policy of combining mass movements with production and the principle of not violating the farming season. (2) Organize temporary mutual aid to rush weeding and replanting, organize women and children to participate in production to make up for the shortage of male labor, and solve the production difficulties of cadres, activists, and militia members participating in the war. (3) Quickly replant barren land with autumn vegetables. Finally, it called on all districts and villages to create new experiences and good methods for \"combining mass movements with production,\" conduct specific inspections in some typical villages, and quickly seek improvements.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安阳县委指示各区  群运中坚持生产\n\n1946-08-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安阳县委指示各区            \n    群运中坚持生产\n　　【本报安阳讯】安阳县委顷发出紧急指示，号召在群运中坚持生产。该指示表扬有些地区白天生产酝酿诉苦，黑夜开会解决问题，并及时分配无人经营的土地给贫苦农民，以提高群众生产情绪深入土地改革运动的作法。同时指出应立即克服顾群运不顾生产，忽视分配荒芜土地，及未能迅速取得斗争果实，因而妨碍生产的严重现象。（一）掌握群运与生产结合的方针及不违农时的原则。（二）组织临时性互助，突击锄苗补种，组织妇女儿童参加生产，补足男劳力之不足，并解决干部、积极分子及参战民兵的生产困难。（三）已荒土地迅速改种秋菜。最后号召各区、村创造“群运与生产结合”的新经验和好办法，并在一些典型村中进行具体检查，迅速求得改进。"

The delegation of forty people, led by Shou Jingwei, Yang Guanbei, Jin Runxiang, Ge Jechen, and others, went to the Kuomintang government to petition at 8:00 AM that day, where they were received by Chief Civil Secretary Wu Dingchang. According to a Central News Agency report, the delegation made the following requests to the authorities: (1) Improve financial measures to save the financial crisis. (2) Implement a linked import and export system, subsidize export industries, and implement high-price purchases. (3) Request an industrial relief loan of 2 billion yuan. The petition delegation then went to the Executive Yuan to petition, but Song Ziwen had already flown to Shanghai beforehand, and they were only received by Jiang Menglin, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Comprehensive News: After American cigarettes poured into Hong Kong, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, the domestic cigarette industry suffered a fatal blow. American cigarettes dominate the entire market in Guangzhou. \"Camel,\" \"Morris,\" and other cigarettes retail for only 500 yuan per pack, while ordinary domestic cigarettes cost 400 yuan per pack, and the best brands are even twice the price of American cigarettes. As a result, nine out of ten (about eighty) cigarette factories have closed down. The largest \"Ministry of Economic Affairs Southeast Cigarette Factory\" has also ceased operations, resulting in the unemployment of tens of thousands of workers. In Shaoguan, over ninety percent of the more than two hundred cigarette factories have closed down, with only nineteen barely surviving. The Sichuan cigarette industry had 327 factories during the war, directly and indirectly supporting 100,000 people. In April alone, 230 factories closed down, accounting for 70% of the original number. Approximately 70,000 people have lost their jobs, and the rest are barely surviving in semi-starvation. In Ningbo, 43 cigarette factories were restored or newly established after the victory against Japan. By the beginning of last month, more than 30 of them had closed down. In Tianjin, domestic cigarette factories have also been closing down one after another. Even the British-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company, which owns 98 cigarette-making machines, has announced its closure due to its inability to compete with American cigarettes.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Chongqing News: The bureaucratic capital's China Textile Corporation is dumping large quantities of American cloth in the interior, resulting in the shutdown of four-fifths of the more than 20,000 weaving factories in Sichuan Province, totaling approximately 16,000 factories. In Chongqing alone, one-third of the workforce has changed professions. Recently, patriotic merchants in various counties of Sichuan Province have advocated promoting domestic goods to resist this trend.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai News: The city's dairy industry, unable to maintain operations due to competition from American merchants, has begun slaughtering dairy cows. According to customs figures, imports of milk powder in April alone amounted to more than 430,000 kilograms. One American ship imported 29,000 boxes of condensed milk into the city, while the total monthly output of the local condensed milk industry is only 1,000 boxes. This large and continuous influx of imports has already seriously threatened domestic milk production, and the huge price difference has further accelerated their demise. According to a survey, the cost of producing one pound of domestic fresh milk is 1,050 yuan. However, the cost of one pound of American condensed milk, including freight and import duties, is only 336 yuan, and it sells for only 700 yuan on the market, resulting in a sharp decline in sales of domestic milk.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 官僚买办资本猖獗美货泛滥  民族工业受致命打击  上海工商界代表赴京请愿\n\n1946-08-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　官僚买办资本猖獗美货泛滥  \n    民族工业受致命打击            \n    上海工商界代表赴京请愿\n    【新华社延安十日电】南京讯：上海工商界因经济危机严重，特组请愿团赴京请愿，已于昨（九）日晨六时抵京。该团一行四十人，由寿景伟、杨管北、金润庠、葛杰臣等率领，于当日上午八时赴国民党政府请愿，由文官长吴鼎昌接见。据中央社消息：该团向当局提出：（１）改善金融措施，挽救金融危机。（２）实行进出口连锁制度，并补贴出口业，实行高价收购。（３）请求工业救济贷款二十亿元等要求。该请愿团于旋赴行政院请愿，适宋子文已于事前飞沪，仅由行政院秘书长蒋梦麟接见。\n    【新华社延安十日电】综合消息：美国香烟源源从港津沪等地涌出后，国产卷烟业顿受致命打击。广州美国香烟统治了整个市场，“骆驼”“摩理斯”等烟零售每包不过五百元，而普通国产烟每包也要四百元，最好的价格竟大于美烟两倍。因此九十九家烟厂已有十分之九（约八十多家）关门。其中规模最大的“经济部东南烟厂”也告停工，失业工人达数万人。韶关二百余家烟厂，百分之九十以上关门，现仅余十九家勉强维持。四川卷烟业在战时曾达三百二十七家，直接间接赖以为生的达十万人。单在四月份就倒闭二百三十家，占原数百分之七十。约七万人已告失业，其余仅勉强维持半饥饿生活。其他如宁波，在抗战胜利后卷烟业复业与新设者有四十三家，迄上月初止，其中三十多家已先后倒闭。在天津，国产卷烟厂也纷纷倒闭了，甚至拥有制烟机九十八台之英商颐中烟草公司，也因无法做美烟竞赛，而宣告停工。\n    【新华社延安九日电】渝讯：官僚资本之中纺织公司将大批美国布匹倾销内地，结果使川省二万家以上织厂的五分之四约计一万六千家停机断杼。单是重庆一地改业者已占总数三分之一，近来川省各县爱国商人均主张提倡国货，以谋抵抗。\n    【新华社延安九日电】上海讯：本市牛奶业，因受美商排挤无法维持，已发生屠宰乳牛现象。根据海关发表数字，今年四月份一月进口乳粉就有四十三万余公斤，而本市进口的一艘美轮就载来炼乳二万九千箱，这里炼乳业的总产量每月只有一千箱，这样大量不断的进口，国产牛奶本已受到了严重威胁，加上价格的悬殊，更促进了她们的死亡。据调查国产淡牛奶一磅仅制造成本就是一千零五十元。但美国炼乳连运费和进口税每磅成本才三百三十六元，市价只售七百元，因此国产牛奶销路顿失。"

Manuilsky strongly stated that Benes' reservation was unfounded because there was no insertion of reservation language by the American side in the full text of the rules suggested by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which was distributed before the Paris Conference convened. The representative of Byelorussia supported the Soviet Union's position in his speech, demanding that the British reservation be dispelled, calling it a \"mistake that must be corrected.\" Subsequently, Benes and others delivered speeches.

    "content": "Reduce Meetings, Increase Production;\n    Promote Mutual Aid in Cart Transport Further\n\n　  [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Among the village cadres in Licheng's Fifth District, a lack of enthusiasm for work and a desire to \"rest and then work again\" has become widespread this year. Cheyuan Village discovered this problem. After several ideological self-examinations, the cadres made deep reflections. They all pointed out that, on the one hand, there were too many meetings, and because they couldn't often participate in the mutual aid teams, they had to exchange at equal value, which meant paying more in labor costs. On the other hand, they often had to go to the county and district for meetings (or training and war participation). Each meeting meant lost work time and bringing food and money for provisions, so cadres were losing too much in the course of their work. After raising these issues, political director Guo Tianfu organized everyone to discuss them specifically and decided that cadres should lead mutual aid teams, solve problems as they arise, reduce large meetings, and adopt more liaison methods to exchange experiences to reduce lost work time. In addition, small-scale cooperatives and agricultural groups were organized in combination, with everyone pooling shares for production and profit-sharing, solving the difficulties of cadres' family production and the wage costs of attending meetings and losing work. This implementation has already achieved considerable results. In the bi-weekly production settlement, a total of 28,000 yuan was earned, with each share receiving a dividend of 700 yuan. For example, the militia committee director invested three shares (1,000 yuan per share) and gained a profit of 2,100 yuan. After using some of it to subsidize his food expenses and labor costs, most of it was reinvested in production as share capital. This immediately boosted the cadres' morale. In addition, the cadres personally participated in the mutual aid teams, which further promoted the work of the mutual aid teams. During the recent mobilization of the entire village for a major inspection, the number of model teams has increased from two to seventeen.

Since October of last year, the factory has implemented a six-hour workday for child laborers. Under the principle of equal pay for equal work, wages have more than doubled compared to the enemy puppet regime. The factory has also helped them organize welfare organizations such as child labor schools and clubs. This summer, considering that the family lives of many child laborers have improved and they no longer need to rely on their children's labor to make a living, the factory conducted a thorough investigation and consulted with the parents of the child laborers. It was decided to help six child laborers under the age of fifteen to completely leave work and go to school to study. For child laborers from families with relatively difficult economic situations, the factory recruited their older siblings to replace them at work, allowing them to take some time off to study. Forty-nine child laborers have implemented a part-work, part-study system. The expenses and stationery for the child laborers' half-day school are all covered by the factory. The curriculum includes Chinese language, arithmetic, general knowledge, and song lyrics. Child laborers from families with economic difficulties still receive full wages.

Peace and democracy are the common path for the whole world and all of China, and also the common path for all armies and all soldiers in China. The general trend is inevitable, and the people's hearts are what we aim for. All who support peace and democracy will surely win, and all who insist on dictatorship and civil war will surely fail. Your courageous action in speaking out is a beacon of light for the armies forced into civil war today. I hope you will continue to work hard to achieve the complete victory of the cause of peace and democracy!\n\nZhu De, August 9th.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Linyi County, 8th. The uprising of General Hao Pengju's Sixth Route Army of the Kuomintang, consisting of more than 20,000 people, is as follows:\n\nIn January of this year, on the eve of the Political Consultative Conference held by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Chongqing, they gathered the 33rd Army Group of Feng Zhi'an, the 6th Route Army of Hao Pengju, and the 117th Division, the 8th Division, and the Weng Wenqing Column under the command of Chen Daqing, a total of ten divisions, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, and advanced northwards into the liberated areas of southern Shandong in three routes, occupying Hanzhuang and other places liberated by the Eighth Route Army from the enemy and puppet forces. The Eighth Route Army endured for the sake of the country, retreated step by step, and advised all officers and soldiers of the attacking forces, requesting them to consider the importance of national peace, democracy, and unity, and to immediately refuse the orders for civil war. On January 9th, General Hao Pengju of the Sixth Route Army, on the left flank of the Kuomintang attacking army, deeply understood righteousness and responded to the call of the military and civilians of the liberated areas, leading all of his officers and soldiers, more than 20,000 people, to stage an uprising on the front line of Taierzhuang, withdraw from the civil war, and stand on the side of the people. The entire army, through public discussion by all officers and soldiers, changed its name to the Democratic Allied Army, and unanimously elected General Hao Pengju as the commander-in-chief. On the same day, they issued a declaration withdrawing from the civil war and supporting democracy, denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to launch a civil war to eliminate dissidents, and the entire army vowed to fight to the end to achieve peace and democracy.\n\nOn January 21st, General Hao Pengju issued his thoughts on the uprising to reporters, elaborating on the purpose and course of the uprising, saying: \"I served in the Kuomintang army at the beginning of the War of Resistance, participated in military affairs, and was ordered to lead troops in and out of the Central Plains front line of the War of Resistance, advocating to attack the enemy with all our strength to reverse the defeat. However, it was contrary to the authorities' policy of eliminating dissidents, the so-called 'two wars, one fight', so I was not tolerated by those in power, and was forced to leave and go into the enemy's rear alone, wanting to make some achievements. Unexpectedly, things went against my wishes, and I became a prisoner of the enemy. At that time, my heart was torn and my five internal organs were burning. I wanted to kill myself to end my life, but then I thought that the national hatred had not been avenged, and it would be useless to die. Moreover, I did not realize the fallacy of the Kuomintang authorities' so-called 'curved line of saving the country in the enemy's rear' which was raging at the time, and I endured humiliation, superficially dealing with the enemy, waiting for the opportunity to avenge the country. Unexpectedly, Japan surrendered and there was no time to explain. I intended to strictly supervise my troops, awaiting punishment from the country, and waiting for a public decision. Who knew that I would receive orders from the Kuomintang authorities to reorganize my troops into the Sixth Route Army and conduct a civil war, which is the most painful thing in the world! The entire army and soldiers were unwilling to make another mistake, so they resolutely held an uprising on January 9th at the Taierzhuang military camp.\"\n\nGeneral Hao then bitterly denounced the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries used and forced miscellaneous troops to conduct civil war, saying: \"The Kuomintang reactionaries' forcing miscellaneous troops to conduct civil war has been obvious to all. Taking this army as an example, on August 10th last year, the day after Japan announced its surrender, it received an order from the Kuomintang authorities to be reorganized into the Sixth Route Army, forcing the army to maintain local security and not allowing it to disarm the troops behind enemy lines; at the same time, the Japanese army also received an order from the Kuomintang authorities to be responsible for assisting in maintaining local security. This was the first step of the Kuomintang reactionaries in launching a civil war. Then we received the so-called 'suppression of the Communists' order. The military reorganization conference held by the Kuomintang authorities was actually a conference to launch a civil war. At the meeting, the Kuomintang reactionaries conspired to provoke a third world war, singing high praises for anti-Sovietism. In foreign policy, a small number of reactionaries colluded with each other to threaten the Soviet Union with American atomic bombs; domestically, they gathered all armed forces and carried out a full-scale civil war, attempting to eliminate the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which had made meritorious contributions in the War of Resistance, and using all miscellaneous troops as tools and victims for their civil war. Therefore, this army was also forced to attack the liberated areas of southern Shandong. Every attack by this army had received a formal order from the Kuomintang authorities in advance. All these facts can be found as ironclad evidence in the orders given to this army by the Kuomintang authorities.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 朱总司令电复郝鹏举将军  望继续努力以求和平民主事业彻底胜利\n\n1946-08-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　朱总司令电复郝鹏举将军            \n    望继续努力以求和平民主事业彻底胜利\n    【新华社延安十日电】朱总司令于昨日复电苏鲁民主联军郝鹏举将军，原电如下：\n    鹏举将军勋鉴：接读反对独裁内战通电，至深钦佩！和平民主为全世界全中国之同一道路，亦为全中国一切军队一切军人之同一道路，大势所趋，人心所向。凡拥护和平民主者必然胜利，凡坚持独裁内战者必然失败。将军见义勇为，振臂高呼，实为今日被迫内战之军队指一光明前途，尚望继续努力，以求和平民主事业之彻底胜利！朱德，八月九日。\n    【新华社临沂县八日电】国民党第六路军郝鹏举将军所部二万余人起义经过如下：\n    今年一月国民党反动派于重庆召开政协会前夕，曾纠集三十三集团军冯治安部、第六路军郝鹏举部、及陈大庆所指挥之一一七师、八师、翁文庆纵队，共十师兵力，在飞机大炮掩护下，分三路北犯鲁南解放区，侵占八路军从敌伪手中解放之韩庄等地，八路军相忍为国，步步退让，并向进攻之各官兵进行劝告，请其体念国家和平民主团结之重要，立即拒绝内战命令。一月九日国民党进攻军之左翼第六路军郝鹏举将军，深明大义，响应解放区军民之号召，率所属全体官兵二万余人，于台儿庄前线举行起义，退出内战，站到人民方面来。并由全体将士公议，易名为民主联军，公推郝鹏举将军为总司令，当于是日发表退出内战拥护民主宣言，痛斥国民党反动派发动内战消灭异己之阴谋，全军并誓为实现和平民主奋斗到底。\n    一月二十一日，郝鹏举将军向记者发表起义感想，阐述起义宗旨及经过称：本人在抗战开始，曾服务于国民党军，参予军机，又受命统率部队出入中原抗战前线，力主以全力击敌，挽回败局，但与当局消灭异己之所谓“两次战争一次打”之政策相违，以致不见容于当道，被迫出走，孤身奔走敌后，欲有所建树，不意事与愿违，身为敌俘，当时椎心泣血，五脏如焚，每欲自戕以了此生，继思国仇未报，纵死无益。又不察鼎沸一时之国民党当局敌后曲线救国谬论之非，含垢忍辱，虚与敌寇委曲周旋，以待时机，得有以雪耻报国，不料日本投降，表白不及。自拟严督所部，待罪国家，听候公决，讵料又接获国民党当局命令，将本人部队编为第六路军，进行内战，天下痛心疾首之事，莫此为甚！全军将士不愿一误再误，乃决然于一月九日在台儿庄军次举行起义。\n    郝将军继即痛陈国民党反动派利用与迫令杂牌军进行内战之事实称：国民党反动派迫令杂牌军进行内战，已为有目共睹之事，即以本军而论，去年八月十日日本宣布投降次日，即接获国民党当局命令，编为第六路军，迫令本军维持地方治安，不准向敌后部队缴械投降；同时日军亦接获国民党当局命令，负责协助维持地方治安。此为国民党反动派发动内战之第一步。接着我们又接到所谓“剿共”命令，国民党当局召开之整军会议，实际为发动内战的会议，在会议上国民党反动派曾阴谋挑起第三次世界大战，高唱反苏。在对外政策上，少数反动派勾通一气以美国原子炸弹威胁苏联；对内则集结一切武装力量，全力进行内战，企图消灭抗日有功之八路军新四军，并以一切杂牌部队为其进行内战之工具与牺牲品，因此本军亦被迫令向鲁南解放区进攻。本军的每次进攻，事先均曾接到国民党当局的正式命令，所有这些事实，均可从国民党当局给本军的命令中找到铁证。"

The stubborn puppet troops were completely disarmed, and the victories are continuing to expand.\n　　【This dispatch from our newspaper’s Changzhi office on the 10th】Our army, conducting a self-defense counterattack along the Zhengtai Railway line, continued to recover stations such as Lujiazhuang, Ranliu, and Qinquan, as well as areas like Zhangjingzhen, on the 8th, and also captured the important stronghold of Longhua Mountain south of Shouyang. By this point, sixty miles of the Zhengtai Railway line were completely under the management of our democratic government. The 213th Regiment of the 71st Division of Yan Xishan's army and the puppet Yang Cheng's troops, entrenched in the area, fled to Yuci in a panic on the night of the 7th. In this battle, over 200 puppet soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured, and nine light machine guns, three small cannons, over a hundred rifles, and sixteen telephones were seized. These places recovered by our army along the Zhengtai Railway line this time were all liberated by our army from the enemy and puppet forces during the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940.\n　　【Xinhua News Agency, Lishi, 10th】Jucheng Town (20 li northeast of Fenyang), an important location on the Pingchuan Fen (Yang)-Wen (Shui) Highway in central Shanxi, and villages such as Mujiazhuang, Xigucun, and Dongcundui east of Qingyuan (all 10 to 25 li southeast of Qingyuan) were successively recovered by the Luliang Eighth Route Army on the 1st of this month and the 28th of last month. A part of the 209th Regiment of the 70th Division of Yan Xishan's army, numbering over 200 men, was annihilated. The aforementioned villages and towns, as well as the vast areas of the Pingchuan region in central Shanxi, were illegally occupied by Yan Xishan's army in early June.\n　　【This dispatch from our newspaper’s Heze office on the 7th】The 85th Army of the Kuomintang in northern Henan has recently been concentrating in the Liyuantun area east of the Pinghan Railway in Jixian County. The puppet Provisional 4th Column of Sun Dianying's troops has also been transferred north from Xinxiang to Tangyin, preparing to coordinate from the north and south to attack Daokou City in Hua County, Jilu Yu. On the 1st, three Kuomintang reconnaissance planes also flew to Daokou to conduct reconnaissance, leading to a tense situation east of the road.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 正太线我军反击获捷  收复段廷马首乱流等车站六十里铁路线已归我管理\n\n1946-08-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　正太线我军反击获捷  \n    收复段廷马首乱流等车站六十里铁路线已归我管理\n    【本报长治七日电】正太沿线阎伪军连日配合同蒲线阎军向我寿阳平定解放区出犯，我八路军忍无可忍，于四日进行英勇反击，先后恢复寿阳属正太路上的上湖、马首段廷等车站，及娘子关以西的白羊圣车站（平定属）亦同获解放。顽抗伪军全部解除武装，战果正继续扩大中。\n    【本报长治十日电】正太沿线自卫反击的我军，八日继续收复芦家庄、乱流芹泉等车站及张静镇等地，并将寿阳以南的重要据点龙化山攻克。至此，正太线已有六十里已完全归我民主政府管理，盘踞该地之阎军七十一师二一三团及伪杨诚部均于七日夜狼狈向榆次逃去。是役毙伤俘伪二百余，缴轻机枪九挺，小炮三门，步枪百余支，电话机十六部。按此次正太沿线我军收复的这些地方，均系一九四○年百团大战中我军曾自敌伪手中解放过的。\n    【新华社离石十日电】晋中平川汾（阳）、文（水）公路上之重地聚城镇（汾阳东北二十里）及清源之东穆家庄、西谷村、东村堆等村（均在清源东南十至二十五里）于本月一日及上月二十八日先后为吕梁八路军恢复。阎军七十师二○九团一部二百余人被歼。上述各村镇及晋中平川广大地区，系六月初旬被阎军非法侵占。\n    【本报荷泽七日电】豫北国民党八十五军，近日正向汲县平汉路东之李源屯一带集结，伪暂编第四纵队孙殿英部，亦由新乡北调汤阴，准备南北配合，进攻我冀鲁豫滑县道口市。一日，国民党侦察机三架，亦飞赴道口上空侦察，致路东形势，顿趋紧张。"

A summary report is as follows:\n    Secret order for attacking Huangqiao, Jiangyan, and Hai'an: First, Tang Enbo, Commander of the Pacification Zone, Operation Order No. 2162 at 14:00 on July 6th, excerpt: (Top Secret) (1) All armies in this zone should immediately assemble their forces...launch an attack to annihilate them and respond to the friendly forces operating in the Tianchang and Xuyi areas. (2) A portion of the 100th Army should secure key points at the Taixing port, with the main force assembling in the eastern area of Taixian before the 9th of this month... A portion of Taixing should assist the 99th Army in capturing Huangqiao, with the main force launching an eastward assault from Taixing, capturing Jiangyan and Qutang within a week, and potentially seizing Hai'an by taking advantage of the victory.\n    Order to the newly formed 49th Division (formerly the 49th Army) for attacking Rugao: \"(1) Omitted. (2) The two battalions of the 78th Regiment of the 12th Brigade, as the right column of the division, should assemble near Baibu Town before tomorrow (14th), complete preparations for the attack, and advance north along the Tongru Highway at dawn on the 15th... After occupying Dingyan, Songjiaqiao, and Gaochangtai, prepare for subsequent attacks. (3) The 79th Brigade, as the left column of the division, should assemble near Yaojiayuan and Yangjiayuan before July 14th, complete preparations for the attack, and advance north along the Tongru Highway at dawn on July 15th, occupying the Dengjiaqiao and Nanmatang lines, and prepare for subsequent attacks. (4) The 105th Brigade should dispatch one battalion each to defend Xiaohai in Haimen, and one battalion to take over the defenses of Tangjiazhai, Pingchao, and Tianshenggang on July 14th, with the main force assembling in Nantong to consolidate the defenses of Nantong City and advance on Xingren Town... (5) The first battalion of the 782nd Brigade, as the right reserve force, should assemble in Baibu Town before July 14th, and then follow the actions of the Li unit.\"\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Frontline, 9th: Zhang Yisheng, a major propaganda and education officer of the political department of the 187th Division of the 65th Army of the Chiang army, which was heading to Jingjiang to participate in the attack on the Suwan liberated area, defected to the liberated area of his own accord because he was tired of the civil war. According to Zhang, the 65th Army belonged to Yu Hanmou's system in Guangdong and had long been discriminated against and divided by the Kuomintang authorities, receiving only \"partial equipment\" (the Chiang army treated its direct and indirect lines differently with full equipment, half equipment, and partial equipment). After being transferred to Ganzhou under the guise of reorganization, they continued to head north. Many officers and soldiers deserted along the way after hearing the news of the civil war. The 580th Regiment alone had sixty or seventy deserters. When they marched north from Wujin to Jingjiang on the 12th of last month, Kuang Guangpei, the political instructor of the 7th Company of the regiment, and Xu Jinji, the political instructor of the company of the 59th Regiment, also ran away. The mid-level officers of the 65th Army had realized that the combat effectiveness of the New Fourth Army should not be underestimated; the lower-level officers were even more depressed and only worried about how to save their lives in the civil war. Zhang had long been disgusted with the civil war but had no opportunity to escape. When the army arrived in Jingjiang, he heard that the countryside was under the jurisdiction of the New Fourth Army, so he resolutely came to the liberated area he had long yearned for. Zhang said that after coming to the liberated area, everything he saw was peaceful and free, completely consistent with what he had seen in progressive pictorials, which made him extremely gratified. In the future, he is willing to participate in the construction work that is beneficial to the people in the liberated area.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖军区自卫战役中缴获蒋介石进攻密令\n\n1946-08-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖军区自卫战役中缴获蒋介石进攻密令\n    【新华社延安九日电】新四军上月在泰兴、如皋地区自卫战役中缴获蒋阴谋进攻，企图消灭新四军之密令及其他主要文件多种，兹摘要报导如下：\n    进攻黄桥、姜堰、海安之密令：第一，绥靖区区司令汤恩伯，七月六日十四时，零字第二一六二号作战令，节开：（极机密）（１）本区各军应即集结部队……即行出击，予以歼灭，而响应天长、盱眙方面友军作战。（２）第一百军一部确保泰兴口岸各要点，主力于本月九日前集结泰县东方地区……泰兴之一部应协助九十九军部队攻占黄桥，主力自泰兴向东突击，于一周内攻占姜堰、曲塘，并可乘胜攻击海安而占领之。\n    为进攻如皋，给新编四十九师（原四十九军）命令：“（１）略。（２）十二旅七八团两个营为师右纵队，应在明日（十四日）前集结白蒲镇附近，完成攻击诸准备，十五日拂晓沿通如公路北进………占领丁堰、宋家桥、高长台之后，并准备尔后之攻击。（３）第七十九旅为师左纵队，应于七月十四日前集结姚家园、杨家园附近，完成攻击诸准备，在七月十五日拂晓，沿通如公路大道北进，占领邓家桥，南马塘之线，准备尔后之攻击。（４）第一零五旅应各派一个营担任海门小海之防务，并以一个营于七月十四日接替唐家闸、平潮，天生港之防务，主力应集结南通，巩固南通城防，对兴仁镇进击……。（５）第七八二旅一营为右预备队于七月十四日前集结白蒲镇，尔后随李部行动。\n    【新华社苏中前线九日电】上月十三日，开往靖江参加进攻苏皖解放区的蒋军六十五军一八七师政治部少校宣教干事张易生氏，因厌弃内战自动投奔解放区。据张氏谈：六十五军属广东余汉谋系统，久受国民党当局岐视分化，仅给予“部分配备”（蒋军按嫡系与非嫡系分全配备、半配备和部分配备三种不同待遇）。用整编名义调到赣州后继续北开，官兵听到内战消息后沿途逃亡者甚众，仅五八零团一团就有六七十个开了小差。上月十二日由武进北开靖江时，该团七连指导员邝光培、五九团连指导员许金基也逃跑了，六十五军的中级官佐已认识了新四军战斗力不可轻视；下级官佐更感苦闷，只担心如何在内战中保存一条性命。张氏早已厌恶内战，但苦无法脱离机会，当该军开抵靖江后，听说乡下都是新四军管辖范围，他便毅然来到了他向往已久的解放区。张氏表示来解放区后，所见一切和平自由景象与平日从进步画报中所见者完全一致，极感欣慰。今后愿在解放区参加有益人民的建设工作。"

Various agencies and organizations in the border region established慰劳(comfort) committees in late last month. Organized慰劳(comfort) groups went to the front lines to慰劳(comfort) the self-defense soldiers. The Experimental Theater Troupe, under the auspices of the Chinese Cultural Association, is touring the war zone. The Border Region Government donated 500,000 yuan (equivalent to 8,000,000 legal currency) to慰劳(comfort) the troops. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Huai'an City Federation of Trade Unions, the textile industry, and Huaqun Tobacco Company, representing more than 200 people, organized a large慰劳(comfort) team, carrying food, watermelons, eggs, and other gifts to慰劳(comfort) the troops in a certain area. Countless people along the way spontaneously joined the effort. More than 1,000 people from Wuhedui organized a慰劳(comfort) group procession that stretched for miles, with banners flying and drums and gongs sounding, in a highly spirited mood. Workers at the Political Department Printing Factory of the Central China Military Region donated more than 21,000 yuan in wages (equivalent to more than 300,000 legal currency) in one day to慰劳(comfort) the troops, and sent letters to the commanders and fighters at the front, vowing to resolutely defend themselves and demonstrate a high degree of work initiative to support the front. People everywhere are particularly enthusiastic about rescuing the wounded. In a certain area on the Central Jiangsu front, a stretcher team led by Wang Guangsheng braved artillery fire to cross the river to rescue the wounded. Fearing that the river water would be harmful to the wounds, they carried the wounded on their backs and climbed down from a bridge. The Li family of three in Huoxian ×× town all rushed to serve the wounded soldiers. Their mother said, \"They were wounded for us, if we don't serve them, who will?\" All teachers and students of the Central China Medical College requested to participate in the work of the field hospital. When the wounded were transported from the front to a certain place in the rear, the cultural association, teachers, students, and people from all walks of life in various departments of the military region went to慰问(express sympathy) and care for them, vying to set up beds, hang curtains, bathe, wash clothes, and provide nutritious food. Cadres of the Central China Bureau of the CPC heard that the wounded soldiers lacked beds and immediately gave up 150 beds, willing to sleep on the floor themselves. Deputy Director Zhao of the Propaganda Department and Deputy Director Liu of the Political Department personally bathed the wounded soldiers. Soldier Zhou Guizhang was unable to lean on the bed because his leg was injured by an explosion. Wang Youping and two other members of the art troupe took turns supporting him all night, and their hands were swollen. But they said, \"We don't feel tired, we only deeply appreciate the joy of serving our brothers.\" From the president to every staff member of the hospital, they are working day and night. The wounded soldiers happily said: \"There is a saying that 'a long illness has no filial son.' We now have too many 'filial sons.' Under everyone's loving care, we only feel honored and forget the pain. Because we are in good spirits, our wounds will heal quickly.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖各机关成立慰劳委员会  热烈劳军支援前线\n\n1946-08-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖各机关成立慰劳委员会            \n    热烈劳军支援前线\n　　【淮阴九日电】苏皖各地掀起劳军与支持前线的热潮。边区各机关团体于上月下旬先后成立慰劳委员会，组织慰劳团分赴各前线慰劳自卫将士。华中文协主持之实验剧团前往战地作巡回公演。边区政府捐款五十万元（合法币八百万元）劳军。华中总工联、淮安市工联、纺织业、华群烟草公司等，代表二百余人组织慰劳大队，携带食品，西瓜、鸡蛋等礼物至某地劳军，沿途无数群众临时自动参加。五河堆市民一千余人，组织之慰劳团行列长达里许，锦旗飘扬，锣鼓喧天，情绪极为昂奋。华中军区政治部印刷厂工友，一天中捐献工资二万一千余元（合三十余万元法币）劳军，并致函前线指战员誓以竭力自卫决心与发挥高度工作积极性支援前线。各地人民对于救护伤员尤为热烈。苏中前线某地王广生领头的一组担架队，冒着炮火渡河去抢救伤员，因怕河水对伤口不利，背着伤员从＠桥上爬下。火线××镇李姓一家三人，全都赶去服侍伤兵。其母亲说：“他们为我们受伤，我们不服侍谁去服侍？”华中医科学，校师生全体请求参加野战医院工作。当伤员由前线运到后方某地时，军区各部门文协、教员、学生及各界群众均纷纷前往慰问看护，争着为他们搭床铺、挂帐子、洗澡、洗衣服，供应富有营养的食物。中共华中分局干部听说伤兵同志缺乏床铺，立即让出床铺一百五十张，情愿自己睡地板。宣教部赵副部长、政治处刘副主任都亲自给伤兵洗澡。伤兵周贵章因腿被炸伤了不能靠床，文工团王幼萍等三人轮流为他扶了一整夜，手都扶肿了。但他们说：“并不感到疲倦，只深深体味到为自己的弟兄服务的愉快”。医院上自院长下至每个工作人员，都是不分昼夜地工作着。伤兵们高兴的说：“俗语说‘久病床头无孝子。’我们现在是‘孝子’太多了。在大家友爱照护之下只感到光荣，忘记了病苦。因为精神愉快，伤口很快就会痊愈的。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 8th. Commander-in-Chief Hao Pengju of the Su Lu Democratic Allied Army recently sent a telegram to the entire country on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the army, opposing dictatorship and civil war, and supporting peace and democracy. The original telegram stated:\n\n　　Chairman Chiang of Guling, Chairman Mao of Yan'an, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Mr. Feng Yuxiang of Guling, Gentlemen of the Democratic League, Commander Chen of Shandong:\n\n　　Since Pengju and others revolted on the front line in Taierzhuang on January 9th of this year, opposing civil war and supporting democracy, we have telegraphed all sectors of the country, appealing for peace and the realization of democracy, and stopping civil war. Our loyalty is clear to heaven and earth! At a time when the Kuomintang reactionaries are relying on foreign forces to undermine peace and launch a large-scale civil war, we are determined to maintain our original intention and are willing to express our sincere words to all peace-loving and democratic military, civilian, business, and academic circles in the country: Pengju and others once belonged to the Northwest Army under Mr. Feng Yuxiang, and have always taken defending the country and loving the people as our duty. When the War of Resistance broke out, we led our troops into the Jin-Lu-Yu battlefield, bravely fought the enemy, risked our lives, repeatedly frustrated the enemy's advance, and advocated full-scale offensives to reverse the defeat. Who knew that this was contrary to the Kuomintang authorities' capitulationist policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops and destroying the CCP's military force \"two wars at once,\" which angered those in power, and we almost faced death. Later, having survived by chance, we secretly entered the occupied areas, intending to kill the enemy. Unfortunately, we were captured by the enemy, incurring dishonor. However, our conscience was not extinguished, and our hot blood still remained. We endured humiliation, buried ourselves in building an army, thinking of taking the opportunity to avenge our shame and repay the country. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese surrender, we were unable to explain ourselves in time, and were then reorganized by the Kuomintang authorities into the Sixth Route Army, entered both sides of the Grand Canal, and were forced to attack the people's armed forces. Pengju and others, witnessing the peaceful and innocent soldiers and civilians who had already been brutally poisoned by the enemy, could not bear to deploy troops and engage in fratricidal strife again. Therefore, on January 9th, we refused the order to engage in civil war and supported peace and democracy in Taierzhuang. Since then, our army has become the people's armed force, and we follow the people's orders. We entered the liberated areas and have been training our troops for the past six months. Pengju and others only seek the hope of peace and democracy, and we will disarm and return to our fields, and be good citizens. This would be a great blessing. Who knew that the Kuomintang reactionaries would repeatedly tear up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, persecute democratic figures, suppress public opinion, and, with the support of foreign money and weapons, launch a large-scale civil war to massacre the people, attempting to realize their dream of dictatorship and autocracy, and plunging the motherland into a state of utter ruin! Violating laws and regulations, disregarding national disasters and the people's lives to such an extent! Today, Pengju and others should not only save the people from suffering, but also save the motherland from danger. We swear to lead tens of thousands of brave soldiers to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, as the backing of peace-loving and democratic people, and to fight for national independence and freedom, for peace and democracy, and for the establishment of a New Democratic China! We still remember that our military colleagues across the country, whether they are longtime comrades-in-arms or comrades who have shared hardships, although they are being held hostage and deceived by warmongers, there are still many heroes who love the country and cherish peace.

Wang Hongyi, head of the Nanqu Chengguan Township, said: \"During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yan'an was the capital of all liberated areas, and Japanese imperialism wanted to bomb it. Now the Kuomintang reactionaries are also coming to bomb it, which is truly a strange thing.\" Mr. Bi Guangdou, a member of the Border Region Government, continued, \"This is deliberately provoking a civil war.\" Merchant Ji Decheng said, \"Last year, Chiang Kai-shek's planes even came to Yan'an to distribute leaflets, signed and sealed, saying that the civil war would be stopped; why doesn't that count?\" Mr. Wu Hanzhang, a border region councilor and principal of the First Primary School, who was sitting with Bi Guangdou, warned the reactionaries angrily, \"Qin Shi Huang wanted to be emperor for eternity, but ended up collapsing in the second generation. Now Chiang Kai-shek wants to be a dictator and emperor, and the people will not allow it!\" Mr. Zhou Hongwen, former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, said, \"During the War of Resistance, Japanese planes bombed Yan'an several times, but the people of Yan'an were not afraid, and we did what we were supposed to do as usual. Now, are we supposed to be afraid of Chiang Kai-shek's planes?\" Wang Desheng, head of the Eastern District of Yan'an City, said, \"The people of Yan'an have been tempered in war and cannot be threatened by airplanes and cannons!\" Dr. Ma Hongzhang, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek relies on the help of American imperialist elements to fight the civil war. He said, \"We must tell the American government to withdraw its troops from China!\" At this time, a young citizen named Zhang Jingquan stood up and proposed: \"If we oppose Chiang Kai-shek, we must take immediate action! Workers must step up production, the people must cultivate their crops well, and merchants must work hard to promote local products. At the same time, we must strengthen the self-defense forces. If the reactionaries attack, we will give them a head-on blow!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为蒋机轰炸延安总部  延市各界集会座谈  准备力量迎头痛击反动派\n\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　为蒋机轰炸延安总部            \n    延市各界集会座谈           \n    准备力量迎头痛击反动派\n    【新华社延安八日电】为蒋机轰炸中共延安总部事，昨日下午五时延市各界市民在民众教育馆举行座谈会。南区城关乡乡长王宏义说：“延安在抗战中是各解放区的首府，日本帝国主义要轰炸它。现在国民党反动派也来轰炸，真是一件怪事。”边区政府委员毕光斗老先生接着说：“这就是居心挑起内战。”商人姬德成说：“去年蒋介石飞机还来延安散了传单，签了名盖了章，说是停止内战；为什么就不算数了？”与毕光斗坐在一起的边区参议员第一完小校长吴汉章老先生激愤地警告反动派说：“秦始皇要永世称帝，结果到二世即亡。现在蒋介石要独裁称帝，人民是不允许的！”前商会会长周鸿温先生说：“抗战中日本飞机来延安炸了几次，我们延安老百姓也没有怕，该做什么还是照常做什么。现在难道就怕你蒋介石的飞机么？”延市东区区长王德胜说：“延安的老百姓是从战争中锻炼出来的，不是飞机大炮威胁得了的！”中医马鸿章老先生指出：蒋介石是依靠美帝国主义分子的帮助打内战。他说：“我们要告诉美国政府，把军队从中国撤出去！”这时一位青年市民张景泉起来提议：“我们反对蒋介石就要立刻行动起来！工人要加紧生产，人民要好好务庄稼，商人要努力推销土产，同时还要加强自卫军。反动派要打来，我们就给他一个迎头痛击！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: In the Suide District of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, all 200,000 *mu* of wheat fields have yielded a bumper harvest this year. The average harvest is estimated at seven *dou* per *mu*, totaling about 140,000 *shi*. Adding spring wheat, peas, and other early grains, the minimum total harvest is 200,000 *shi*. With a population of 550,000 in the entire district, each person can obtain about 3.6 *dou* of new wheat. It is said to be the first year of bumper harvest since 1930. The people of Haojiaqiao, Tianzhuang, Xizhisazui, Fanjiazhen, and other places in Suide are celebrating the harvest with unparalleled joy in village meetings. At the same time, they continue to organize labor exchange for summer weeding to strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn. Jingxiang Township, Tianzhuang District, Suide, held a harvest celebration meeting on July 17th and awarded Ma Yinhe and model cadre He Yinghua, and six others who actively organized mass production. In Haojiaqiao Village, a sandy area, the masses' mood is even higher. The meeting on the 18th lasted from after dinner until late at night, and the masses were unwilling to disperse, eagerly discussing weeding labor exchange. Hao Yongfeng's labor exchange team challenged Liu Yuhou's labor exchange team, guaranteeing to finish turning over the wheat fields before the end of the summer heat and weeding four times. Liu Yuhou immediately accepted the challenge and proposed organizing children to pull weeds and weed seedlings, and read the newspaper every half month.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: The wheat harvest in the counties of the Yan'an Special District in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was completed successively from the beginning to around the 20th of last month. The total harvest from over 910,000 *mu* of wheat fields in the entire district is approximately 170,000 *shi*, more than double the yield of 75,000 *shi* last year. Lucheng County has the best harvest in the Yan'an area. The wheat in the county contains more than 60 grains per ear, and one *mu* can yield six *dou* (in previous years, each *mu* could only yield three or four *dou*). Labor hero Yang Buting planted a total of 28 *mu* of wheat, harvesting over 30 *shi*, an average of more than one *shi* per *mu*. Among them, the best six *mu* of wheat fields yielded a total of 15 *shi*, an average of 2.5 *shi* per *mu*. In various places, many women went up the mountains to participate in the harvest. In Yanchuan County, in the Huosheng District alone, over 500 women participated in the wheat harvest.\n\nHuimin, 6th: In the Bohai District, in Kenli County (a new county, the northeastern part of the original Lijin County), a once desolate and uninhabited area, there is a Zhu Jia Wu Zi Village. Before the War of Resistance, poor and destitute farmers came to this wasteland to reclaim land many times, but they were forced to flee due to the extreme exploitation of the Kuomintang authorities, bandit disturbances, and Yellow River floods. After the Eighth Route Army liberated the area in 1941, farmers flocked to the area to reclaim land under the encouragement of the democratic government. Over the years, they have established the area into a prosperous village of 230 households. Starting from scratch, the economic status of the farmers has continuously improved. There are now eleven rich peasant households, over 180 middle peasant households, and over 50 poor people who have established their own families. The entire village of over 900 people has over 3,500 *mu* of land and over 100 head of livestock. Merchants gather at every market, and the scenery inside and outside the village is beautiful. Every time the sun sets, herds of cattle and horses return from the riverbank, and fishermen carry fish ashore from small boats. The entire village is filled with an atmosphere of abundance and joy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 再接再厉欢快锄秋苗  绥德分区夏麦丰收  渤海朱家屋子荒野成良田\n\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　再接再厉欢快锄秋苗            \n    绥德分区夏麦丰收           \n    渤海朱家屋子荒野成良田\n    【新华社延安十一日电】陕甘宁边区绥德分区，今年二十万垧麦地全部丰收。平均收获量每垧以大斗七斗计算，共约收十四万石，加上春麦、碗豆等早粮最低共可收二十万石。全分区五十五万人口，一个人约可得新麦三斗六升，据说为民国十九年以来的第一个丰收年。绥德郝家桥、田庄、西直沙、范家圳等地人民，一面以无比欢快的心情分开村民大会庆祝丰收，一面再接再厉继续组织变工夏锄，以争取秋天丰收。绥德田庄区井乡，于七月十七日举行丰收庆祝会大会，奖励了积极组织群众生产的马银合和模范干部贺英华等六人。沙区郝家桥村，群众情绪更高，十八日大会从晚饭后一直开到深夜，群众还不肯散，热烈讨论锄草变工。郝永丰变工队向刘玉厚变工队提出竞赛，保证赶伏尽翻完麦地、锄四次草。刘玉厚即起应战，并提出组织娃娃拔草锄苗，半月读一次报。\n    【新华社延安六日电】陕甘宁边区延安专区各县，麦收已于上月初至二十日左右先后完毕。全分区九十一万余亩麦田，共约收麦十七万石，产量较去年之七万五千石超过一倍。鹿县丰收为延属之冠，该县的麦子每穗包藏着六十余粒，一亩可收六斗（往年每亩只能收三四斗）。劳动英雄杨步挺，共种了二十八亩麦子，收麦三十余石，平均每垧一石多，其中有六垧最好的麦田，共收麦十五石，平均每垧收麦二石五斗。各地在收割中很多妇女上山参加，仅延川县或胜区三乡，即有五百余妇女参加麦收。\n    【惠民六日电】渤海区过去荒无人烟的垦利县（新县，原利津县东北部）有一个朱家屋子村，抗战前穷苦无依的农民，曾多次来到这荒原上开垦，但均因国民党当局极度压榨，土匪扰乱，黄河水灾等原因，被迫逃散。民国三十年八路军解放后，农民在民主政府奖励下纷至该地拓荒，几年来将该地建立成一所二百三十户的繁荣村庄。垦民白手起家，经济地位不断上升，现有富农十一户，中农一百八十余户，五十多个贫民都已成家立业，全庄九百余人，有地三千五百余亩，有牲口百余头，每集商贩云集，庄内外风景秀丽，每当夕阳西下时，成群牛马从河畔归来，渔夫从小船上担鱼上岸，全村充满丰裕欢乐的景象。"

The Kuomintang government and the Communist side have been asked to immediately notify the relevant generals at the front line of the agreement, and then the three members will decide when and where to settle General Li Xiannian's troops. The terms of the agreement are as follows: (1) Both sides declare a ceasefire from midnight on August 6, 1946, until August 26, 1946. (2) All Kuomintang troops currently pursuing General Li Xiannian's troops shall cease pursuit and withdraw twenty miles. (3) The Kuomintang and Communist armies shall cease fire on the western front, and both sides shall withdraw ten miles from their current positions, the Kuomintang army withdrawing ten miles to the west, and the New Fourth Army withdrawing ten miles to the east. (4) General Li Xiannian orders his troops to cease moving. (5) General Li Xiannian will send a representative to Xi'an to confer with the Ninth or Thirty-Second Executive Group of the Executive Headquarters. The representative will arrive in Xi'an before midnight on August 9, 1946. (6) General Li Xiannian's troops, scattered due to pursuit, may regroup, and the Kuomintang army shall guarantee their safe passage, pending the disposal of the three members. (7) The Thirty-Second Group will assist the Kuomintang government and the New Fourth Army troops in providing supplies and caring for the sick and wounded. (8) Copies of this agreement will be immediately delivered by special envoy to the relevant generals and sent to the Beijing Executive Headquarters and the Nanjing Three-Person Committee. (9) The Ninth Executive Group will designate an appropriate area for the New Fourth Army to be stationed, and all Kuomintang troops shall withdraw from that area. The Ninth Group will be responsible for adjusting the work in this area and will submit it to the higher authorities for approval. (10) The field commanders of all parties concerned shall write to the Thirty-Second Executive Group in Xi'an, stating that they have received this agreement and clearly expressing their approval or disapproval. This notification to the Thirty-Second Group shall be issued before midnight on August 9, 1946. (11) Whenever a Kuomintang or New Fourth Army field commander fails to comply with this agreement established by the Ninth and Thirty-Second Executive Groups, the Three-Person Committee and the Executive Headquarters shall be immediately notified so that necessary steps can be taken. This agreement shall not prejudice any agreement and instructions concerning fundamental principles previously or future published by the Beijing Executive Headquarters or the Nanjing Three-Person Committee. This agreement was reached by the Ninth Executive Group on July 27.\n　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th】Xinhua News Agency reporter comments on the joint communiqué issued by the Beijing Military Mediation Department on the 9th of this month regarding the three-week ceasefire agreement on the Central Plains issue: Since June 26, when Chiang Kai-shek ordered the encirclement and annihilation of Li Xiannian's troops in the Central Plains, which failed, he issued another order in mid-July to pursue Li's breakthrough troops with infantry, preventing them from gaining a \"foothold,\" instructing the air force to conduct reconnaissance and bombing along the way, and offering a reward of 3 million yuan for the capture of General Li Xiannian. Currently, in addition to the Chiang troops originally pursuing Li's troops, Hu Zongnan has transferred four divisions to block the troops that broke through to southern Shaanxi and is continuing to reinforce them. On the 4th of this month, Zhu Shaozhou, chairman of Shaanxi, stated: \"Notify Li Xiannian himself and his subordinates to leave Shaanxi within a time limit,\" not allowing the troops to have a foothold. Since January, Chiang's side has successively violated the \"Luoshan Agreement,\" the \"Yingshan Agreement,\" and the \"Hankou Agreement\" of May 10, attacking our army in the Central Plains in violation of the agreement. In more than half a year, he has occupied almost all of the Central Plains liberated areas with a population of five million, so it is questionable whether Chiang's army will abide by the agreement this time. As long as Chiang's army stops attacking and stops reinforcing troops, the CCP will definitely firmly abide by the agreement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 军调部发表特别公报  中原停战三星期\n\n1946-08-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　军调部发表特别公报            \n    中原停战三星期\n　  【新华社延安十一日电】北平讯：调处执行总部于本月九日对中原停战问题发表特别公告如下：北平执行总部三委员，致电武汉团营主任程潜，南阳国民党军总司令刘峙，老河口国民党军总司令孙霆，西安国民党军总司令胡宗南暨中共军李先念将军等，指示关于各该将领部队之临时停战协定，并已请国民党政府与中共方面立即将协议通知前线有关之各将领，然后再由三委员决定何时及何处安置李先念将军之部队。协定条件如下：（一）一九四六年八月六日半夜起，直至一九四六年八月二十六日止，双方宣布停战。（二）所有目下追击李先念将军部队之国民党军，均应停止追逐而撤退二十英里。（三）国共两军应在西线停止开火，双方由其目前之阵地向后撤退十英里，国民党军向西撤退十英军，新四军向东撤退十英里。（四）李先念将军命令其部队停止移动。（五）李先念将军派代表前往西安与执行总部第九或第三十二执行小组会商，代表将于一九四六年八月九日半夜之前抵达西安。（六）李先念将军部队因被追击而分散者得重会合，国民党军应保证彼等安全通行，以待三委员之支配。（七）第三十二小组将协助国民党政府与新四军部队办理给养及看护伤病员。（八）本协定之抄本将立即由专使送达各有关将领，并送至北平执行总部及南京三人委员会。（九）第九执行小组将指定一适当地区俾新四军驻扎，所有国民党军应自该地区撤退。第九小组将负责调整此一地区之工作，并将呈请上峰核准。（十）有关各方之战地司令官均应致书西安第三十二执行小组，说明已接获此一协议并明确表示赞同或不赞同之意见。此项交于第三十二小组之通知书，应于一九四六年八月九日午夜以前发出。（十一）每遇国民党军或新四军战地司令官不遵守此一第九及三十二执行小组成立之协议时，应立即向三人委员会与执行总部控告，以便采取必要步骤。此一协议不得妨碍北平执行总部或南京三人委员会以前或未来发表之任何协议及有关基本原则之指令，此一协议系执行部第九小组于七月二十七日获致者。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】新华社记者评北平军调部本月九日发表关于中原问题三周停战协定之联合公报：溯自六月二十六日，蒋介石手令一举包围歼灭中原李先念部未成，又于七月中旬再下手令对突围李部以步兵跟迹追击，不使其有“立足”机会，责令空军分路侦察轰炸，并悬赏三百万元捉拿李先念将军。目前除原追击李部之蒋军外，胡宗南已调四个师向突围至陕南部队阻击，并在继续增援中。本月四日，陕主席祝绍周称：“通知李先念本人及其部属，限期离开陕境”，不让部队有立锥之地。蒋方从一月起，已先后破坏“罗山协定”、“应山协定”及五月十日之“汉口协定”，违约进攻中原我军。半年余来，已将我五百万人口之中原解放区侵占殆尽，因此蒋军此次能否遵守协议颇成问题。只要蒋军停止进攻，停止增兵，中共是一定坚决遵守协议的。"

In areas without rain, organize watering of seedlings, and launch the construction of small canals and wells, and the rational use of water sources and waterwheel irrigation tools, \"watering a plant to keep it alive counts.\" 3. Launch a movement to save food and clothing, and save up for famine preparedness. Each village should specifically plan to save food for the famine, and cadres and activists among the masses should play an exemplary role. 4. Strictly prohibit the export of food grains, strengthen the militia, step up sentry duty, and arrest special agents and smuggling merchants.\n\nCurrently, the masses in various places, under the leadership of the democratic government, have actively taken action. In Lin, Zan, Gao and other places, a widespread movement to carry water and replant has been organized. In Chengdi and other villages in Lincheng, all male laborers in the mutual aid teams have been organized to carry water to irrigate the land, and elderly, weak women and children have all gone to the fields to plant. All seeds and farm tools have been adjusted. Most of the land in Xicun has been planted. After careful calculation in the Chengguan District of Gaoyi, farmers who usually engage in small businesses have suspended their trade and are all working in the fields. Under the leadership of political director Chi Mengxiao and production committee member Chi Luxiang in Tuling Village, Zanhuang, more than 190 mu have been planted by carrying water. Yuan (shi) has generally received thorough rainfall, and various villages are now rushing to plant buckwheat and radishes. The county government has issued a circular to the cooperatives in various villages to expand their funds and save grain with the goal of overcoming famine, and has called for the organization of transportation teams to carry grain from Shanxi, as well as advocating thrift and the collection of substitute foods. Under the leadership of labor hero Xu Kuizi in Chujiatan Village, Jingxing, the village has implemented a daily savings of two liang of rice per person, with an average of two fen of vegetables planted per person in the whole village, and twenty jin of wild dried vegetables collected.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行临赞等县夏旱雨迟  农民抢种晚秋作物  作到每人一亩荞麦半亩菜加紧岗哨严禁粮食走私\n\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行临赞等县夏旱雨迟            \n    农民抢种晚秋作物         \n    作到每人一亩荞麦半亩菜加紧岗哨严禁粮食走私\n    【本报长治讯】一专区临（城）、赞（皇）、元（氏）、获（鹿）、高（邑）、井（陉）等县入夏亢旱，得雨甚迟，部分地区至今未获透雨。秋禾多未种上，春播之秋庄稼亦多枯萎，旱象已成。一专署特于日前再度发布紧急指示，号召“节衣缩食防旱备荒”规定：一、已获雨地区立即组织种晚谷、菜、荞麦，必须作到“每人一亩荞麦半亩菜”。各县合作社及村中互助组织应负责调剂种籽，贫苦者可贷给种籽。二、未雨地区组织浇苗，发动修小渠、打井，合理使用水源与水车等灌溉工具，“浇活一株算一株”。三、发动节衣缩食，储蓄备荒运动，各村应具体计划省下渡荒粮食，干部与群众中积极分子应起模范作用。四、严禁食粮出口，健全民兵，加紧放哨，缉捕特务及走私奸商。\n    现各地群众在民主政府领导下已积极行动起来，临、赞、高等地普遍组织了担水补种运动，临城澄底等村互助组全部男劳力已组织起来，突击担水润地，老弱妇女儿童一齐下地点种。种籽与农具均作了全部调剂。西村土地大部已种上。高邑城关区经过精密的计算，平时作小商的农民均暂停买卖，一律下地，赞皇土岭村在政治主任池梦小与生产委员池禄祥领导下，已担水点种一百九十余亩。元氏已普获透雨，各村现正抢种荞麦、萝卜。县府通令各村合作社以渡荒为方针，扩大资金，储蓄粮食，并号召组织运输队到山西担粮，号召节约与采集代食品。井陉楚家滩村在劳动英雄许魁子领导下，已实行每日每人节约米二两，全村平均每口种菜二分，采集野生干菜二十斤。"

On August 3rd, after the Eighth Route Army recovered Potou, Dianshang, Quanyi, Hengjian, and other places, the puppet 17th Division's 51st Regiment and Wei Ansheng's troops regrouped in Baipo, Yezhu, and the east and west Yangshu areas. On the morning of the 4th, under the cover of two aircraft, they launched a fierce attack on us. After a day and night of intense fighting, the invading army was annihilated by our forces, and Yezhu, North Chen, South Chen, and the east and west Yangshu areas were recovered by us. On the 5th and 6th, three battalions of the 17th Division successively crossed the Yellow River from Tiexie in Henan to reinforce them, but they were all annihilated by us, and Jili was recovered by us. In four days of fighting, we captured one mortar, fourteen heavy machine guns, thirty-eight light machine guns, over nine hundred rifles, and sixteen thousand bags of flour. We killed and wounded over one thousand five hundred officers and soldiers of the puppet 17th Division's 51st Regiment, including the deputy commander Su Youshan, and over one thousand officers and soldiers of the 17th Division, including the division commander Wang Guodong, laid down their weapons. On the evening of the 7th, over two thousand Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from Henan continued to reinforce Baipo from Tiexie, launching a fierce attack on us. Intense fighting is still ongoing.\n    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan on the 6th] The Kuomintang 90th Army, which crossed the Yellow River and invaded Potou, Baipo, Yezhu, and other areas of our Meng County on January 14th (after the ceasefire order took effect), has used this as a springboard to attack the Henan-North Liberation Area for the past half year, building over two hundred bunkers and attacking us over sixty times, brutally killing over five hundred cadres and civilians. After the Kuomintang's 53rd Division reinforced the Jin-South civil war battlefield in early July, the defense of Meng County was taken over by the Kuomintang-reorganized puppet 17th Division. This puppet division, together with the Kuomintang security forces on the south bank of the Yellow River, formed the Luo (Yang) Meng (Jin) Heng (Shui) Command, unifying the command of local teams and organizing Henan-North fugitive traitors and special agents to expand their attacks on our Henan-North area. Our army was forced to launch a self-defensive counterattack on the evening of August 3rd, recovering Potou, Dongzhai, Baipo, Quanyi, Dianshang, and other places in Meng County occupied by the Chiang and puppet troops, capturing fifteen machine guns and over a hundred rifles, and over two hundred Chiang and puppet troops laid down their weapons.\n    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan on the 7th] From January 13th, after the ceasefire order, to the end of June, our Eighth Route Army in the Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu area was forced into self-defense. According to very incomplete statistics, there were over one thousand three hundred battles, large and small, recovering five county towns, including Dongming, Jiang County, Wenxi (occupied again by the Chiang army on July 11th), Fushan, and Meng County, and over four hundred and ten villages and towns. We eliminated and wounded fifteen thousand nine hundred and four Chiang and puppet troops, captured thirty-six thousand six hundred and seventy-one, and six thousand four hundred and fifty surrendered or revolted. We captured twenty-four thousand one hundred and forty-three rifles and carbines, one thousand and seventy-one light and heavy machine guns, nine hundred and fifty-five pistols, six mobile machine guns, one hundred and one submachine guns, forty-four mortars, seven mountain guns, two hundred and ninety grenade launchers, fifteen small cannons, four hundred and twenty-five thousand and forty-five rounds of rifle ammunition, fifty-two thousand eight hundred and fifty-two grenades, four hundred and forty-one mules and horses, two hundred and fifty-eight telephones, twenty radios, eleven radios, one hundred and twenty textile machines, and many other spoils of victory.

(2) The CPC insists on implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and immediately convening the PCC, while the Kuomintang authorities oppose this proposition, believing that political issues cannot be discussed without forcibly occupying the aforementioned areas. (3) The CPC advocates the establishment of a democratic coalition government accountable to the National Assembly, while the Kuomintang authorities oppose this proposition, insisting on one-party dictatorship. (4) The CPC advocates \"politics leading the military\" and \"separation of military and civilian administration,\" while the Kuomintang authorities oppose this proposition, continuing military dictatorship. (5) The CPC demands that the Kuomintang authorities immediately implement the four promises, cease terrorist tactics against democrats, and guarantee the people's democratic rights and the legal status of all parties, but the Kuomintang authorities refuse this demand. Originally, the above points had already been agreed upon, and were already included in the ceasefire agreement, the PCC resolutions, and the military reorganization plan, but the Kuomintang authorities have continuously overturned these agreements, while the CPC has consistently struggled to realize these agreements. Well-informed sources continued: \"Chinese democrats have long seen clearly that the reason why the reactionaries dare to act recklessly, causing the mediation of Marshall and Stuart to fail and creating the serious civil war situation that the two had to acknowledge, is actually the result of the U.S. authorities' erroneous policy of aiding the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government. Without even considering the distant past, after the U.S. State Department spokesman issued a statement on the 5th stating that \"there is absolutely no change in the policy towards China,\" and after the Anping Incident on July 29th, the Kuomintang authorities' enthusiasm for carrying out the civil war further increased. Civil war expert Bai Chongxi cheered the U.S. State Department's statement, and Chen Cheng loudly advocated for a \"military showdown.\" This fact should arouse the serious attention of the American people and democrats.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th] According to a dispatch from the United States Information Service, Nanjing, on the 10th: General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart issued a joint statement here this afternoon as follows:\n    General Marshall and Dr. Stuart have continuously worked together to find various possible ways to end the increasingly expanding struggle in China and initiate the initial steps to establish a government in a truly democratic manner.\n    As far as the Chinese people are concerned, the desire for a peaceful resolution of political problems seems to be consistent, and the economic situation must be resolved immediately in order to avoid complete collapse.\n    The war is expanding daily and threatens to sweep the entire country beyond the control of those responsible. Both the KMT and the CPC are willing to end the war, but as far as an immediate solution is concerned, there are still some issues that have not been agreed upon.\n    Regarding these issues, it seems impossible for both parties to reach a solution, and the resolution of these issues can indeed allow the issuance of universal orders to completely end the war in China. Some outstanding issues are related to military reorganization, but as far as resolving the problem is concerned, the difficulties caused in this regard are actually greater than another more fundamental problem. That is, what kind of local or county government should be maintained in each evacuated area after military reorganization before the National Assembly makes a fundamental decision on such matters? This is a fundamental issue.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 延安消息灵通人士观察  马歇尔调停失败原因乃美国援蒋政策错误\n\n1946-08-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　延安消息灵通人士观察            \n    马歇尔调停失败原因乃美国援蒋政策错误\n　　【新华社延安十一日电】美特使马歇尔与大使司徒雷登二氏，于十日发表联合声明，表示国共双方在若干基本问题上，距离甚远，中国内战正在“日益扩大”，并有“席卷全国”之势。据此间消息灵通人士观察，造成马歇尔等调停失败的国共双方的分歧点，至少有下列数点（一）中共一向坚主无条件停战，而国民党当局则坚持反对这种主张，坚主武力占领苏北、热河、察哈尔、东北九省等地。（二）中共坚主实行政协决议，并立即召集政协会议，而国民党当局则反对这一主张，认为非武力占领上述地区无从谈政治问题。（三）中共主张成立对国会负责之民主联合政府，而国民党当局则反对这一主张，坚持一党专政。（四）中共主张“以政治军”、“军民分治”，而国民党当局则反对这一主张，继续军事独裁。（五）中共要求国民党当局立即实行四项诺言，停止对民主人士的恐怖手段，保证人民的民主权利与各党派之合法地位，而国民党当局则拒绝这一要求。本来以上数端早曾获得协议，早已包括在停战协定政协决议与整军方案之中，但国民党当局不断地推翻这些协议，而中共方面则始终为实现这些协议而奋斗。消息灵通人士继称：“中国民主人士早已看清楚反动派之所以敢于肆意妄为，使马歇尔与司徒雷登的调停归于失败，造成二氏所不得不承认的严重内战形势，实由于美国当局援助蒋介石独裁政府的错误政策的结果。远者姑且不论，在美国务院发言人于五日发表声明称“对华政策绝对无变更”，及七月二十九日安平事件发生以后，国民党当局进行内战的积极性更加提高，内战专家白崇禧对美国务院声明表示欢呼，陈诚则高唱“武力决赛”。这一事实，应当唤起美国人民与民主人士的严重注意。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】据美国新闻处南京十日电：马歇尔将军与司徒雷登大使，今日下午在此发表联合声明如次：\n    马歇尔将军及司徒雷登博士，曾不断共同就其各种可能方法，从事终止中国目前日趋扩大之斗争，并发起最初步骤，以依建立真正民主方式之政府。\n    就中国人民而言，和平解决政治问题之愿望甚似一致，如欲避免完全崩溃，经济状况必须获有立即之解决。\n    战争日益扩大，且有席卷全国超出负责者控制外之威胁，国共两方均愿终止战事，但以言有关立即解决则仍有若干问题未获协议。\n    对于各该问题，双方似无获得解决可能，而此种问题之解决确可准许普遍命令之颁发，完全终止全中国之战事。若干悬而未决之问题乃系关于整军方面者，但就解决问题而言，此方面所引起之困难，实较另一更为基本之问题为将在国民大会对此种事件未获得基本决定前，整军后之各撤离区内应维持何种性质之当地或县政府，此即属其基本问题是也。"

    "content": "Traitor Zhang Jingzhong's Legacy Harms the People\n　　Qin River Breach Floods 50,000 Mu of Farmland\n　　Qin County and Yuanqu County Governments Help People Restore Production\n　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Jiaozuo] In mid-July, continuous rain caused the Qin River to breach at Wuchekou in Wuzhi County, flooding over 50,000 mu of fertile land between the Qin River and the Yellow River. Over fifty towns and villages were turned into a watery expanse. Although the floodwaters have receded, the autumn harvest is entirely lost. The Fourth Administrative Office of the Taihang Region and the Wuzhi County Government have dispatched personnel with grain to the disaster area for emergency relief and to survey the damage at Wuchekou. It is reported that Wuchekou was deliberately breached by Kuomintang's Fourth District Commissioner, traitor Zhang Jingzhong, on June 22nd of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), causing floods to overflow from this point every year. Since this spring, our government has been planning to repair the Wuchekou project for several months, starting construction several times, but all were halted midway due to harassment by stubborn enemy troops on the opposite bank. In May, the county requested the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to assist in the damming project. UNRRA sent personnel to survey the area, but they were also met with gunfire from the Kuomintang troops on the opposite bank and were prevented from proceeding, leading to this calamity for the people of Qinnan. The local people deeply hate Zhang's breaching of the dyke and the enemy's sabotage of the damming efforts. They have issued a circular telegram, appealing to the entire country to denounce the crimes of traitor Zhang Jingzhong, requesting support from all areas, and demanding that the Kuomintang troops withdraw from the Wuchekou sentry posts to facilitate the repair of the river embankment. In view of the severe disaster caused by the Qin River breach, the Fourth Administrative Office has telegraphed the Administrative Office of the Border Region, requesting full regional cooperation in providing relief. In addition to allocating 100 shi of grain for emergency relief, the County Government is actively seeking loans and organizing production for self-salvation, ensuring that no one starves to death. Production self-salvation committees have been established in various districts, and they are studying various specific methods for production self-salvation. The masses in the disaster area are deeply grateful for this benefit and are extremely moved, believing that \"under the leadership of the democratic government, we will definitely be able to overcome the disaster.\"\n　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Yangcheng] Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yuanqu County had six coal mines in Shigou, Wulongmiao, Wenjiawan, Yanweigou, Jieyu, and Dundixia, which could have supplied five-thirds of the county's fuel. However, they were all shut down due to the brutal destruction by the enemy and puppet regimes for several years, leading to extreme fuel shortages among the people. As a result, 90% of the trees and most of the houses in the county were felled and destroyed to be used as fuel. After our army recovered Yuanqu, the democratic government immediately supported the people in restoring the coal industry. Currently, the Limin, Minli, and Minxing coal mines have been restored, with a daily output of 53,000 catties, solving part of the fuel problem. Restoration efforts are continuing.\n　　[Yangcheng, 10th] After the liberation of Qin County, the democratic government is actively carrying out post-disaster recovery work. The Taiyue Administrative Office has allocated 12,000 catties of grain for emergency relief. The people in the old liberated areas of the county have spontaneously launched a mutual assistance and mutual relief campaign. The liberated villages and towns are brewing struggles to overturn the old order, denounce grievances, and combat traitors. All farmers are seizing the time to rush to sow seeds, and young and middle-aged men are demolishing enemy and puppet fortifications, tidying up their homes, and restoring cultivated land.\n　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Changzhi] After the second liberation of Changning Town in Yuci on June 17th, after more than a month of efforts by the local government and the masses, more than 30 hectares of wasteland have been transformed into fertile fields with flourishing seedlings. The town is mostly wetland, rich in cotton and tobacco, but because the Yan Xishan puppet army forced the masses to transport bricks to the Yuanwo Station on the Zhengtai Railway every day during their occupation, they missed the farming season, and no planting had been done by the time of liberation. After our army liberated the town for the second time, it fully organized the masses to replant. In addition to all the full and semi-labor force of the entire village being put into production, 200 head of livestock were drawn from the old liberated areas to sell their labor to support the effort. It rained heavily on the 20th of last month, and another batch of late crops was rushed to be planted, completely eliminating the wasteland. The masses reflected that without the leadership of the democratic government, they would only starve to death after the autumn harvest this year.\n(Xiao En)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 张逆敬忠遗祸人民  沁河决口淹田五万亩  沁县垣曲政府助民恢复生产\n效恩\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　张逆敬忠遗祸人民            \n    沁河决口淹田五万亩           \n    沁县垣曲政府助民恢复生产\n    【本报焦作讯】七月中旬连日阴雨，沁河于武陟县之五车口决口，沁河与黄河之间五万余亩良田全被淹没，五十余个镇尽成泽国。现洪水虽退，秋禾已全部无望。太行四专署与武陟县府已派员携带粮食赶赴灾区急赈，并勘察五车口冲决情况。按五车口于民国三十二年六月二十二日为国民党第四专员张逆敬忠所决开，年年洪水必由此处漫流。今春以来我政府为修复五车口工程筹划数月，几次兴工，均为对岸顽军袭扰中途停止。五月该县要求联总协助堵口工程，联总派员勘察，亦遭对岸国民党军开枪射击，被阻未果，致使沁南人民遭此奇祸。当地人民对张逆决堤与顽军破坏堵口极为痛恨，已发出通电，向全国控诉张逆敬忠的罪恶，要求各地声援，要求国民党军队撤退五车口岗哨，以利修堵河堤。四专署鉴于此次沁河灾情惨重，特电行署边府，要求全区协力救济。该县府除拨粮一百石急赈救济外，并积极设法贷款，组织生产自救，不让饿死一个人。各区建立了生产自救委员会，正研究各种具体生产自救办法。灾区群众躬受此惠，感愤异常，认为“在民主政府领导下，一定能胜利的渡过灾荒”。\n    【本报阳城讯】抗战前垣曲县有柿沟、五龙庙、文家湾、燕尾沟、解峪、墩底下等六座煤窑，本可供全县五分之三的燃料。但在敌伪的数年残酷摧残下全部停工，民间燃料极度恐慌，因此全县百分之九十的树木及大部民房被砍伐、折毁充当燃料。我军收复垣曲后，民主政府立即扶植民众恢复煤业，现已恢复利民，民立、民兴三座煤窑，日产量五万三千斤，解决了一部分燃料问题。现仍在继续恢复中。\n    【阳城十日电】沁县解放后，民主政府正积极进行善后恢复工作，太岳行署已拨粮一万二千斤，施行急赈，全县老解放区人民自动发起互助互济运动，解放了的村庄城镇正酝酿翻身诉苦反奸斗争，全体农民争取时间突击播种，青壮丁纷纷平毁敌伪工事，整理自己家园，恢复耕地。\n    【本报长治讯】榆次长凝镇在六月十七日二次解放后，经过当地政府群众一个多月的努力，已将三十多顷荒地变为绿苗繁茂的良田，该镇多为水地，盛产棉花烟叶，但因阎伪军盘踞时每日强迫群众至正太路源涡车站运砖，误了农时，至解放时仍未下种。我军二次解放该镇后，即全力组织群众补种。除全村全半劳力全部投入生产外，并由老区抽二百犋牲口前往卖工支援，上月二十日落了透雨，又抢种晚庄稼一批，荒地始完全消灭。群众反映不是民主政府领导，则今年秋后只有饿死。  \n    （效恩）"

According to this principle, the new France will have a House of Representatives (lower house) and a Senate (upper house) with limited powers. The government will not be responsible to the upper house, and the upper house's power will be limited to reviewing bills passed by the House of Representatives and sending them back for reconsideration. Regarding the president, the Constitutional Committee decided that he will be elected by the two houses and given considerable power, including the right to propose a candidate for prime minister. However, the latter must be approved by a majority in the House of Representatives before forming a cabinet. Other issues are still under discussion. The Constitutional Committee's decision is the result of a compromise among the three major parties, especially the French Communist Party's endurance for the sake of the nation.

    "content": "Production and Thrift Overcome Natural Disasters\n    Jinnan Region Universally Launches Famine Preparations\n    Shi Decai Calls on the Whole Village to Rush-Plant, Qinghe Establishes Seed-Planting Committee\n    [Our newspaper, Weixian News] The movement of thrift and famine preparation has become widespread in Jinnan. Yaoshan County Government called on every household in the county to make a thrift plan, prohibit extravagant eating and drinking, strive for frugality in weddings and funerals, and preserve old wheat as wheat seeds (because this year's wheat has jaundice). In Zaoqiang County, each institution saves one tael of grain per person per day in August. The Wuyi County Committee decided to practice austerity, educate the masses to strictly investigate smuggling, prevent grain from flowing out, and convene a forum of labor heroes to discuss methods for saving and preparing for famine: 1. Plan according to the family, calculate how many people are in the family and how much grain they need to eat? How much can be harvested this year? How to supplement the shortfall from thrift and collecting substitute foods. 2. Practice strict economy, never sell grain, do not wear new clothes, eat more coarse grains, millet flour, and wild vegetables. Guangzong Fifth District convened a joint meeting of teachers and decided to leach salt in large quantities, pick up more wild vegetables, organize women to spin and weave to earn money to buy grain, and engage in more side occupations. Gucheng Fifth District responded to the call from higher authorities to rush-plant, squeeze time to pick wild vegetables and tree leaves, and replant late seedlings. Village cadres and farmers' associations in Zhenghe Village, Weixian County, all help the masses to formulate production and thrift plans and organize transportation teams. The Second District of Jize County proposed that we must not neglect famine preparation because of the heavy rain when rush-planting late seedlings.\n    [Another News] After a heavy rain in the Seventh District of Weixian County, labor hero Shi Decai of Shengfotang Village, in response to the famine preparation call of the district party committee and administrative office, mobilized all men and women, young and old, in the village to actively rush-plant late seedlings. In just two days, late seedlings and vegetables have been rush-planted.\n    Most areas of Qinghe have been dry for a long time without rain. The county government specially convened an enlarged meeting of village cadres near the station to discuss seed planting methods. After detailed calculations, it was estimated that if one person fell the soil, three people planted the seeds, and five people carried water every day, a total of eight labor units could plant one large mu. After the calculation, everyone established confidence and decided to establish a seed-planting committee. The county serves as the general association, the village as the branch association, and the group as the unit. The committee members are responsible for leadership, uniformly allocating land by group, and first taking care of the families of soldiers and the poor. In a lively discussion, a challenge competition was proposed on the spot. Everyone was full of confidence, believing that this method would definitely overcome natural disasters, and they all returned to the village enthusiastically to lead the development of the seed-planting movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 生产节约战胜天灾  冀南区普遍展开备荒  石德才号召全村抢种清河成立点种委员会\n\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　生产节约战胜天灾            \n    冀南区普遍展开备荒           \n    石德才号召全村抢种清河成立点种委员会\n    【本报威县讯】节约备荒在冀南各地已成为普遍运动。尧山县府号召全县每户都订节约计划，禁止大吃大喝，婚丧礼事力求节省，保存陈麦做麦种（因今年麦子有黄疸病）。枣强县各机关，八月份每人每天节省一两粮食。武邑县委会决定节衣缩食，教育群众严查走私，勿使粮食外流，并召开劳英座谈会，讨论节约备荒办法：一、按家计划，计算一家多少人，要吃多少粮食？今年能收多少？不足数如何从节衣缩食采集代食品中补充。二、厉行节约，绝不卖粮食，不穿新衣，多吃粗粮、谷面、野菜。广宗五区召开教员联席会，决定大量淋盐，多拾野菜，组织妇女纺织赚钱买粮食，多搞副业。故城五区响应上级抢种号召，挤时间采野菜树叶，补种晚苗。威县郑河村村干部及农会都帮助群众订生产节约计划，组织运输小组。鸡泽县二区在抢种晚苗时，提出不能因下透雨而疏忽备荒。\n    【又讯】威县七区落了透雨，圣佛堂村的劳动英雄石德才为响应区党委、行署的备荒号召，动员全村男女老少积极抢种晚苗。仅仅在两天内，晚苗菜蔬已抢种完毕。\n    清河大部地区久旱不雨。县府特召集驻地附近村干部扩大会，讨论点种办法，经详细计算，如每天有一人倒地、三人点种、五人担水，共八个工即可点种一大亩。经计算后，大家奠定了信心，决定成立点种委员会。以县为总会，村为分会，组为单位，各委员分工领导，按组统一分地，首先照顾抗属及贫苦的人。在热烈讨论中，当场提出挑战竞赛。大家充满信心，认为这办法定能战胜天灾，都兴致勃勃的回村领导点种运动的开展。"

The New York Herald Tribune on July 30 strongly stated: Although the Kuomintang may be stronger militarily, the strength of the Chinese left-wing is greater than theirs politically. The Chinese left-wing is carrying out land reform with the peasants for the benefit of the peasants. The newspaper cited the main political program of the CCP as implementing democratic reforms, believing that the Chinese Communists can win the support of the broad masses of the people in implementing this political program. The newspaper pointed out in an editorial: \"The policies of the Chinese Communists show that the Kuomintang reactionaries cannot defeat this policy.\" On the same day, an American newspaper essay broadcast by a New York radio station said: \"The Chinese Communists demand land reform, and their demands will undoubtedly be approved by the people, not only from the point of view of people's livelihood, but also from the point of view of practical policy. The practicality of these demands has been tested in one-third of China's residents. The Chinese Communist Party has implemented Sun Yat-sen's great doctrine in these areas, including the basic purpose of his doctrine - to solve the democratic problems of the people.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: According to a United Press dispatch from Washington: California Congressman George Miller advocated the rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. He said in a statement on the 8th: \"The sooner they leave China, the better our situation will be.\" He believes that one Marshall is enough for the United States in China, and he said that the U.S. military has little or no benefit to Marshall's effectiveness as a mediator. Miller is a member of the U.S. House Committee on Island Affairs and recently returned from a 33,000-mile trip around the world.

    "content": "What I Saw in the Old Liberated Areas\n    Zhang Lizhi\n    This is an excerpt from a letter written by Mr. Zhang Lizhi, the vice principal of Taihang No. 8 Middle School (in Jiaozuo City), to his fellow villager Mr. Feng. Mr. Zhang went to the administrative office in mid-July to attend a meeting of secondary school principals. It was his first time in the heartland of the liberated area, and he was deeply touched by what he saw and heard along the way. In his letter to Mr. Feng, Mr. Zhang said: \"The scenery along the way is very different from our place, it's really enviable.\" The following are excerpts from the letter:\n    Nothing Lost: We were traveling by car to the river滩 north of Gaoping when we lost a large leather bag, only realizing it after traveling seven or eight 里. A comrade was extremely anxious because his official documents and important items were stored inside, so he returned to the original location to search for it. We had not traveled two 里 further when a person came running from a small path south of the road, shouting loudly, \"Comrade, you dropped your bag!\" We looked and were overjoyed. We never expected the original item to be returned, it was truly an unprecedented sight.\n    Well-Organized Guest Houses: We generally stay in inns when traveling, but sometimes we can't reach an inn due to rain. In that case, the village guest houses provide food and lodging, and the hospitality is extremely attentive, so military and government travelers do not feel the hardships of travel. This is also an unprecedented fact.\n    Doors Unlocked at Night: It was cloudy and heavily raining, and the Zhang River was overflowing. Travelers were gathered and staying in Zhao Shatun Village (north bank of the Zhang River). We also stayed in the village. Late at night, we could still hear constant laughter and talking on the main street. Upon asking, we learned that they don't lock their doors at night, living in peacetime, so that is why.\n    Fruit and Vegetables Everywhere: The fruit trees on both sides of the road are laden with fruit, hanging no more than two or three 尺 from the ground. Melons and vegetables are all over the ground and are very conspicuous, but passersby never steal them. Other peaches and apricots are ripe, colorful to look at, and fragrant to smell. Old and young people pass by, acting as if they don't see them. Are the people here all of the Xu Heng type? How honest they are!\n    Children's Teams Take Things Seriously: Large and small villages all have children or women standing guard, checking pedestrians, and taking things very seriously. Even high-ranking military and government officials riding horses or in cars are not spared. In the past, children and women were useless people, but now they are organized and responsible for self-defense. The scale of this force is unheard of.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 老解放区见闻\n张励之\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　老解放区见闻\n    张励之\n    这是太行八中（在焦作市）副校长张励之先生给他乡亲冯某信中之一段。张先生七月中旬由焦作到行署参加中等学校校长会议，系第一次到解放区腹地，沿路所见所闻，感触殊深。张先生在与他乡亲冯某信中说：“来时路上风光，与咱处大不相同，真是令人羡慕。”兹将该信摘记于后：\n    路不失遗：我们坐车到高平以北之河滩，将大皮包失掉，走七八里始为发觉。有一同志，异常着急，因他的公文及重要物品，均在内保存，故仍返原地找寻。我们前行不到二里，乃有一人从汽路南之小道，飞跑奔来，大声高呼“同志，把皮包掉了”。我们接着一看，喜出望外，想不到原物送来，真是空前未有之奇见。\n    招待所组织完备：我们行路以住店为原则，然有时因雨赶不到店时，而村中之招待所，备吃备住，招待极其周到，使军政行人，不感旅行之苦，亦为空前未有之事实。\n    夜不闭户：天阴大雨，漳河暴涨，旅客均集住赵苫村（漳河北沿）。我们亦在该村留宿，夜深仍闻大街上说笑声不断。问之，乃知夜不闭户，过升平时光，故如此也。\n    瓜果满目：汽路两旁之果木，果实满挂，距地不过二三尺，瓜菜满地，非常醒目，而行人从未偷盗。其他桃杏已熟，望之有色，嗅之有香，老少经过，置若罔见。抑此地之人皆许衡之流耶，何诚实若是？\n    儿童队认真：大小村庄，均有儿童，或妇女站岗，检查行人，异常认真，虽军政要职，骑马坐车者，亦不能幸免。过去儿童妇女，乃无用之人，今则组织起来，负责自卫，力量之大，闻所未闻。"

    "date": "1946-08-14",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 10th: The following is a summary of Molotov's speech at the plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference on August 8th: The Soviet delegation disagrees with the decision of the Rules of Procedure Committee. According to this decision, the conference should vote on its motions by a simple majority, rather than by a two-thirds majority as suggested by the Council of Foreign Ministers. We disagree that the conference can pass important motions by a simple majority, i.e., eleven delegations forcing ten delegations to accept important motions. The Soviet delegation believes that this decision is wrong and firmly insists that the committee's erroneous decision must be corrected. The rules of procedure are very important issues at international conferences. This conference must express its views on many serious issues. Seeking unity among all participants at international conferences is a guiding principle, of course, this is not a simple matter. But since we are gathered here, we should seek unity, seek mutual understanding, and seek reasonable compromises; and we must understand that any other method will not produce good results when solving international problems. The principle of seeking consensus in passing all resolutions has been repeatedly adopted by international organizations in the past and now. All decisions at the conferences of major powers during the war were passed after mutual agreement. The Council of Foreign Ministers, established by the Berlin Conference, also carried out all its work on the basis of complete unanimity. Only those with very short sight would think that useful results can be obtained in dealing with international affairs without seeking the consensus of the countries concerned.\n\nThe Council of Foreign Ministers submitted to the conference a proposal on the rules of procedure for voting in the plenary sessions and committees of the conference. The proposal reads as follows: \"Decisions of the conference on procedural matters shall be passed by a simple majority vote, and decisions and recommendations on all other matters shall be passed by a two-thirds majority vote.\" The Council of Foreign Ministers spent some time to reach a consensus on this point. I must admit that the Soviet Union particularly insisted on this point. However, the British delegation submitted an amendment to the Rules of Procedure Committee. This proposal was opposed by several delegations, but it has been passed by the committee. The original text is as follows: \"The conference's recommendations can be divided into two parts: (1) those passed by a two-thirds majority; (2) those approved by a simple majority but less than a two-thirds majority. Both types of recommendations will be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers for consideration.\" This proposal cancels the Council of Foreign Ministers' proposal on the voting rules of the conference. Everyone knows that the conference's recommendations cannot order the Council of Foreign Ministers; on the other hand, we all admit that it is beneficial to allow the conference to make certain recommendations, which will help the final peace. Our insistence that motions must be passed by at least a two-thirds vote is not concerned with the number of votes, but with the hope of seeking consensus for the conference through this voting method. The political significance of the Council of Foreign Ministers' proposal that important issues must be passed by two-thirds is precisely this. The decision of the Rules of Procedure Committee overturns this proposal, it ignores the need to strive for unanimous decisions, which will disrupt the entire work of the conference. The responsibility for why the Rules of Procedure Committee allowed this error lies with the British delegation that moved this proposal and the American delegation that actively supported this proposal in the Rules of Procedure Committee, hoping that they can ensure that the conference passes the proposals they want. After a long discussion, the Council of Foreign Ministers passed an agreed resolution, but at the conference, the US and British delegations abandoned this agreed resolution and returned to their original proposal, that is, the conference passes recommendations by a simple majority.\n\nEveryone knows that when it was necessary to fight our common enemy, the Soviet Union did not stand in the last row among the Allies. The Soviet Union is proud of the fact that it has saved European civilization from the fascist beast. In this struggle, the Soviet Union has made unprecedented sacrifices. We have lost seven million people. The merits of the Red Army and the inestimable losses of the Soviet Union make it our responsibility to remind everyone here that the voices of the Soviet Union and other democratic countries have urged a consistent procedure on international issues, and this voice is worthy of everyone's attention.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: The conference continued at 10:00 am on the 11th to discuss the issue of Albania's participation in the conference. Albania's request to attend the plenary session and the committees related to the peace treaty with Italy was supported by the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The Soviet Union supported Albania's request to participate in the conference, because Albania helped the Allies with its resistance movement. Benes suggested on the evening of the 10th that this issue be submitted to the Steering Committee of the conference. Alexander (acting head of the British delegation) expressed his agreement. Benes said: The chairman claimed last night that he had received applications from Mexico, Egypt, and Cuba. If the invitation includes these countries, he is willing to accept the Czech proposal (Note: The Czech proposal is that Albania, as an ally and a neighbor of Italy, expresses its views at the plenary session of the conference and the Committee on the Italian Peace Treaty). Benes' proposal was immediately accepted by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, but this issue was still postponed to the 12th for formal discussion and voting. During the discussion, because the Greek representative unreasonably opposed Albania's participation, the Yugoslav representative, Bijedic, immediately denounced: Since the conference, Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris had privately suggested to him in Paris that \"Yugoslavia and Greece jointly divide Albania\", and accused Greece of constantly pursuing a policy of creating wars in the Balkans, and that the Greek government had not abandoned this policy. He said that after all the historical lessons, it was shocking that Greece still intended to destroy Albania, and this was the motive for preventing Albania from participating in the conference. When the Yugoslav representative was about to finish his speech, Tsaldaris immediately stood up to try to quibble, but Chairman Bidault pointed out that Greece had violated the procedure, but Tsaldaris still did not stop speaking, and Bidault recognized it. Soviet representative Vyshinsky and Czech representative Kader formally proposed a motion in favor of Albania's request to interrupt Tsaldaris' speech. The plenary session on the 11th also discussed the draft of the Four Powers' Peace Treaty with Italy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫洛托夫八日演说中  揭露英美图操纵和会  苏坚持议案通过票数应为三分之二苏南捷波支持阿尔巴尼亚出席和会\n\n1946-08-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　莫洛托夫八日演说中            \n    揭露英美图操纵和会         \n    苏坚持议案通过票数应为三分之二苏南捷波支持阿尔巴尼亚出席和会\n　　【新华社延安十日电】八月八日莫洛托夫在巴黎和会全体大会的演说，摘要如下：苏联代表团不同意程序规则委员会的决定。按这一决定，和会应以过半数票表决其议案，而不是按外长会议的建议应有三分之二多数通过。我们不同意和会可以一票的多数就通过其议案，即十一个代表团迫使十个代表团接受重要的议案。苏联代表团认为这一决定是错误的，并坚决主张该委员会的错误决定必须改正，表决规则在国际会议上是很重要的问题。本次会议必欲对许多严重问题表明其观点，在国际会议上求取全体与会者的团结一致，是一个指导原则，当然这并不是一件简单的事。可是我们既然集于一堂，我们就应该求得一致，求得互相谅解，求得互相合理的让步；而且必须了解解决国际问题时，用别的任何办法是得不到好结果的。在通过一切决议时求取一致的原则，过去和现在都为国际组织所屡屡采用，战争期间一切强国会议上的一切决定，都是经过互相同意之后才通过的。柏林会议所创立的外长会议，其全部工作也是在完全一致的基础上实行的，惟有目光十分短浅的人，才会以为在处理国际事务时，不用求得有关各国的意见一致也可以得到有用的结果。\n    外长会议向和会提出了关于和会全体会议和委员会上表决规则的建议，该建议内容如下：“和会关于程序性质问题的决定，应以过半数票通过之，关于其他一切问题的决定及建议，则应以三分之二票通过之”。为对这点求得一致意见，外长会议很费了一些时间。我应该承认，对于这一点苏联特别坚持，可是英国代表团却在程委会上提出了修正案，这提案曾引起若干代表团的反对，但业由该委会通过，其原文如下：“和会的建议案可分为两部：（一）经三分之二多数通过者，（二）经过半数、但在三分之二以下票数赞同者。两种建议都将交给外长会议审议”。这一建议，取消了外长会议关于和会表决规则的建议。我们每一个人都知道，和会的建议案，对于外长会议并不能下命令；另一方面，我们大家都承认，让和会提出某些建议案是有好处的，有助于最后和平的。我们之坚持议案必须至少三分之二票数通过，它所关心的不重投票的数目，而是希望以此表决方法来为和会求得一致。外长会议之建议重要问题必须三分之二通过的政治意义正在于此。程委会的决定，推翻了这一建议，它忽略了争取一致决定的必要性，这将会搅乱整个会议的工作。程委会为什么允许这种错误，其责任在于动议这一建议的英国代表团及在程委会中积极支持这一建议的美国代表团，希望他们能够保证会议通过他们所希望的建议。外长会议在长期讨论之后，通过了协议的决议，可是在会议上，美英代表团都抛弃了这一协议的决议，回至他们原来的建议，即会议以过半数通过建议。\n    大家知道，当必须和我们的共同敌人作战的时候，苏联在盟国中并没有站在最后一排，苏联因为它曾从法西斯野兽手中拯救过欧洲文明的事实而感到骄傲。在这次斗争中，苏联曾经作了前所未闻的牺牲，我们曾经损失了七百万人，红军的功勋以及苏联不可估计的损失，使得我们有责任在这里提醒大家，苏联以及其他民主国家的呼声，曾敦促在国际问题上采取一致的程序，这种呼声是值得大家听取的。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】和会十一日上午十时续开，讨论阿尔巴尼亚参加和会问题。阿尔巴尼亚要求出席全会及与对意和约有关的各委员会之声请，获得苏、南、捷、波的支持，苏联以阿国曾以其抵抗运动帮助盟国，故支持该国参加和会要求。贝纳斯十日晚建议将此问题提交和会指导委员会，亚历山大（英代表团代团长）对此表示赞同。贝纳斯称：前晚主席声称曾接到墨西哥、埃及、古巴之申请，倘邀请中包括这些国家在内，则愿意接受捷克之建议（按：捷克建议为阿国以盟国与意大利邻国的资格在和会全会及对意和约委员会上发表其意见）。贝纳斯之提议旋为苏、捷两国所接受，但此一问题仍延至十二日正式讨论表决。在讨论过程中，因希腊代表无理反对阿国参加，南代表彼犹德即席指斥：自和会以来，希腊总理曹德利斯曾在巴黎私自向他建议，“由南国与希腊共同瓜分阿国”，并指斥希腊经常奉行在巴尔干制造战争之政策，而希腊的政府也未放弃这种政策。并谓经过一切历史教训后，希腊仍蓄意灭亡阿国，实令人震惊，而这就是阻止阿国参加和会的动机。南代表发言将毕时，曹德利斯立即起立拟施狡辩，主席比道尔乃指出希腊违反程序，然曹德利斯仍不中止发言，比道尔遂认可。苏代表维辛斯基及捷代表卡德尔正式提出赞同阿国要求之提案，以打断曹德利斯发言。十一日全会并讨论四强对意和约草案。"

On the morning of the 9th, the team held a meeting at the Beiping Executive Headquarters. The Chiang and US sides continued to reject discussions on the team's investigation and the Chinese Communist side's proposed procedural issues with an arrogant and unreasonable attitude, preventing the team from truly beginning consultations. The investigation procedure proposed by the Chinese Communist side was exceptionally straightforward: First, listen to the report from the representative of the US Marine Corps Headquarters. Second, go to the Communist-controlled areas to listen to the reports from the local military authorities of the Communist side. Third, listen to the reports from the local military authorities of the government. Fourth, determine the speakers for the three parties to be heard. Fifth, other necessary measures. Sixth, summarize the investigation and write a report, and the three committee members will release the news. However, the US chairman and the Chiang side's representatives fundamentally refused to discuss this suggestion. Their purpose was to force the Chinese Communist representatives to blindly act without procedure or plan, and to listen to their unreasonable dictates in everything. They also attempted to use the report of a person unilaterally designated by the US side as material for the 25-member team to conduct deceptive propaganda to the world. This conspiracy has been exposed by the Chinese Communist representatives on the spot. The Chinese Communist representative, Committee Member Ye, and the US representative, Committee Member Rao, had agreed that the team should first agree on the working procedures, and that the report from the US Marine Corps representative could be heard first when the procedures were being determined. However, by the afternoon of the 8th, when the 25th team continued to meet, the US representative still unreasonably refused to discuss the working procedures and tried to immediately begin listening to the report of the person unilaterally decided by the US side, according to the trap predetermined by the US side of the team. Therefore, the afternoon team meeting still had no results.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Beiping dispatch: The special team formed to investigate the Anping conflict held its third team meeting on the morning of the 6th. The Chinese Communist representative, Major General Huang Yifeng, proposed an investigation procedure, including the following four locations: namely, the US Marine Corps Headquarters in Tianjin, the Tianjin Government Army Headquarters, the Chinese Communist Army Headquarters, and the location of the incident. In addition to immediately departing for Tianjin, the team should immediately dispatch a liaison group to the area where the incident occurred to establish contact with the Chinese Communist Army Headquarters. According to the purpose of this proposal, it was to enable the team to depart quickly and take care of the US side's request for security guarantees, but Davis did not consider it at all. At the meeting on the 6th, when the Chinese Communist representative raised the investigation procedure for the fourth time, the US representative, Davis, adopted a completely unreasonable and arrogant attitude, insisting on the so-called chairman's prerogative to summon witnesses he himself designated to the meeting to listen to reports. When discussing the team's action plan, after repeated explanations and multiple protests by the Chinese Communist representative, Davis ignored them due to his autocratic arrogance and lack of the spirit of equality and democracy, resulting in the special team meeting on the morning of the 6th ending without results.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋美双方蛮不讲理  安平事件调处无结果  我方提议讨论工作程序屡遭拒绝\n\n1946-08-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋美双方蛮不讲理            \n    安平事件调处无结果           \n    我方提议讨论工作程序屡遭拒绝\n　　【新华社延安十一日电】北平讯：八日下午出发调查安平事件的特别小组，无任何结果，已返回北平。九日上午，小组在北平执行部开会，蒋美双方继续以蛮横无理的态度拒绝讨论小组调查及中共方面提议讨论程序问题，以使小组真正开始协商。中共方面所提议的调查程序异常简明：第一，听取美海军陆战队司令部之代表的报告。第二，往中共地区听取中共地方军事当局的报告。第三，听取政府地方军事当局报告。第四，确定三方之听取人报告。第五，其他必要之措施。第六，总结调查做报告，三委员公布新闻。然而这个建议美方主席及蒋方代表根本拒绝讨论，其目的在于压迫中共代表在无程序无计划的盲目行动下，一切听其无理支配，并且企图以美方片面指定的人报告，作为二十五小组的材料，向全世界进行欺骗宣传，这个阴谋已经中共代表当场揭露。中共叶委员与美方饶委员，曾商定小组应先商定工作程序，在规定程序时，可以先听取美陆战队代表报告。但至八日下午，第二十五小组继续开会时，美代表依然无理拒绝讨论工作程序，力图依照小组美方事先确定好的圈套，立刻开始听取美方片面决定的人之报告，因此下午小组会议仍未有任何结果。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】北平讯：为调查安平冲突而组成的特别小组，六日晨举行第三次小组会议，中共代表黄逸峰少将提议调查程序，包括下述四处：即天津美陆战队司令部，天津政府军司令部，中共军司令部及出事地点。小组除立即出发天津外，应即时派遣一连络组前往出事地区，与中共军司令部建立联络。按此次提议目的，在使小组迅速出发及照顾美方安全保证之要求，戴维斯始终不加考虑。六日会上，当中共代表第四次提出调查程序时，美代表戴维斯采取完全无理蛮横态度，坚持所谓主席特权，召集其自行指定之证明人到会，听取报告。谈商小组行动计划时，经中共代表再三说明，多次抗议，因戴维斯独断横蛮及毫无平等民主之精神置之不理，致六日晨特别小组会议无结果。"

    "content": "Observations on the Liberated Area\n    郝鹏举\n\n　　The giant wheel of the times is advancing rapidly in the torrent of democracy, and fascist rule has become the dregs of modern political systems. Because we recognized the needs of the times, we resolutely raised the banner of \"Withdraw from the civil war, support democracy,\" and moved from the reactionary sphere of influence to the liberated area—the home of the people.\n\n    Since we moved to the liberated area, after five months of rigorous training, the troops have made great progress in essence. All of our soldiers have begun a learning competition. Learning from the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army has resulted in: improved soldiers' lives, advanced management methods, strengthened unity within our army, and improved combat skills. We have not only become the people's armed forces, but also a powerful armed force. This is the most valuable gain our army has made since arriving in the liberated area.\n\n    In the liberated area, we have received warm love and help from the military and civilians, especially when they often send us provisions and firewood from hundreds of miles away, which makes us extremely grateful and excited. Therefore, on the one hand, we conserve consumption to reduce the burden on the people, and on the other hand, we help the people with spring plowing and summer harvesting to increase the people's productive power, and implement the spirit of serving the people. The relationship between the military and civilians here is very harmonious, and we and the people of the liberated area have become one family.\n\n    Since we are the people's armed forces, our thoughts and actions must be completely integrated with the interests of the people. We will sweat when the people want us to sweat; we will bleed when the people want us to bleed. Since the ceasefire agreement was issued, we thought the threat of civil war had been eliminated, and the people could enter a smooth path of peaceful construction. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed their faith, tore up all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, secret agent thugs committed crimes everywhere, and mobilized millions of troops to launch a frenzied offensive against the liberated area. From Central China, North China to the Northeast, the flames of civil war are everywhere, and the people have already suffered the planned massacre by the reactionaries.\n\n    Our original intention in launching the uprising was to \"withdraw from the civil war and support democracy.\" Now that the reactionaries, with the support of foreign imperialist elements, are once again creating civil war and destroying democracy, we must resolutely stand on the position of safeguarding the interests of the people, and are willing to join hands with the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, with the determination to die and the belief in victory, to launch a sacred war of self-defense against the reactionaries attacking the liberated area in order to stop the civil war and defend peace and democracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放区观感\n郝鹏举\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放区观感\n    郝鹏举\n    时代的巨轮已经在民主的洪流中激进，法西斯的统治已成为现代政治制度的残渣。我们因为认清了时代的需要，坚决的高举“退出内战，拥护民主”的义旗，从反动派的势力范围走向了解放区——人民的家乡。\n    我们自移驻解放区以来，经过五个月的严格训练，部队已在本质上有了很大的进步。我们全体将士开始发动一种学习的竞赛运动。向八路军新四军学习结果：战士生活改善了，管理的方法进步了，本军的团结加强了，战斗的技术提高了；我们不仅成为人民的武装，而且成为一支有力的武装，这是本军开到解放区以来，所得到的最宝贵的收获。\n    我们在解放区曾得到军民热烈的爱护与帮助，尤其他们常从百里以外送给我们给养柴草，真使我们万分的感激与兴奋。所以我们一方面节约消费减轻人民的负担，另一方面就帮助人民春耕夏收，以增加人民的生产力量，贯彻为人民服务的精神。在此军民关系非常融洽，我们和解放区的老百姓成了一家人。\n    我们既然是人民的武装，那么我们思想上行动上就要完全和人民的利害结合起来，人民要我们流汗我们就流汗；人民要我们流血我们就流血。自从停战协定颁发后，我们以为内战的威胁已除，从此人民可进入和平建设的坦途。不料国民党反动派背信弃义，撕毁政治协商会议一切决议，特务暴徒到处行凶，并且调集百万大军向解放区疯狂进攻，从华中、华北到东北，到处都弥漫着内战的火焰，人民业已遭受着反动派有计划的屠杀。\n    我们起义初衷原为“退出内战拥护民主”，现在反动派既在外国帝国主义分子支援下，再度制造内战破坏民主，我们当义不容辞的坚决站在保卫人民利益的立场，愿与八路军新四军携手并肩，以必死的决心，必胜的信念，为制止内战保卫和平与民主，向进攻解放区的反动派展开神圣的自卫战。"

    "date": "1946-08-14",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Experiences in Mediating Civil Cases\n    Suo Lin\n\n    \"Mediation is the mass line in judicial work for civil cases (and individual criminal cases).\"\n\n    In the first half of last year, the Cixian County Judicial Section received and concluded 76 civil cases, of which 75 were settled through mediation. In the second half of the year, a total of 174 cases were received, and with the exception of 27 unresolved cases, only 2 cases were appealed (and even these appeals were settled through mediation by the Special Commissioner's Office). This illustrates that the mediation policy is entirely correct. \"Mediation\" is a delicate and arduous work of persuasion and education, so mediation is no easier than adjudication. Writing a judgment only requires following the interrogation, arguments, case details, and laws, and a judgment can be issued regardless of whether both parties accept it or not; while mediation aims to strengthen mass unity, so it is necessary to eliminate contradictions based on the principle of voluntary participation by both parties. This requires understanding the psychology of the parties, exposing their intentions, and paying attention to political and educational methods in order to convince both parties sincerely. Therefore, the following points should be noted when conducting mediation:\n\n    (1) Adequate Preparation in Advance\n\n    A thorough investigation of the temperament, demands, family circumstances, and the entire case of both parties should be conducted in advance to allow for refutation and explanation based on laws and facts during mediation, preventing demands from being too high or too low. This is the key to determining the success or failure of mediation. For example, in the land dispute between Gong Xingzheng of Gongjia Village and his sister-in-law, Gong Zhou, it was discovered through investigation that some village cadres were biased towards Gong Xingzheng's localism, fearing that the land would be lost. In addition, Gong Zhou was a foul-mouthed woman, and the neighbors were dissatisfied with her. Gong Xingzheng was also from a \"large and prosperous family,\" so everyone \"supported the bamboo pole and not the well rope\" (supported those with power). Gong Zhou's backing was her maternal brother, Zhou Yougui. Therefore, in understanding the case, one must first understand these factors in order to accurately examine and analyze the materials, otherwise it is easy to be deceived and wronged. Another example is the case of small businessman Qiao Liye and Wang Rongjin et al. concerning business account differences. Recognizing that the general characteristic of this group of people was \"fondness of petty advantages,\" this point was seized upon, and both parties were persuaded. Afterward, not only was there no resentment, but an order for goods was immediately placed to continue doing business.\n\n    (2) Democratic Discussion Should Be Used to Discover the Focus of Dispute\n\n    In individual interrogations or conversations, the focus of the dispute between the two parties should be identified. At this time, our attitude must be calm and amiable. A farmer or worker who has never been involved in a lawsuit will speak tediously. In particular, women will bring up even the smallest details, and sometimes they may stray far from the topic. We can interrupt and guide them, but we must never put on a stern face, otherwise they will \"not dare to speak,\" and it will be difficult for you to understand their suffering and even harder to find the center of the dispute. Mediation will fail if you lose control of the center. For example, the aforementioned land case in Gongjia Village was actually an inheritance issue, but it appeared as a dispute over seven fen of land at the entrance, which led to lawsuits for more than a year, five mediations (one by the head of the family, two by village cadres, and two by the district office), and involved twelve administrators. After the mediation, instead of \"turning small things into nothing,\" the initial dispute over seven fen of land \"turned small things into big things,\" and even affected more than two mu of land on the eastern mountain. In the end, a re-division of the family property was proposed. This was entirely due to the bias of the original administrators (village cadres) and the failure of the district office to discover the focus of the dispute, which incited both parties to raise even bigger issues. However, after discovering the above situation, and after individual talks with the administrators and Zhou Yougui (Gong Zhou's backer), a democratic discussion was launched. Good and bad people were recognized, and the center of the intention to raise issues was exposed. As a result, both parties calmly accepted the mediation.\n\n    Failing to find the center of the issue can turn small things into big things. It is common to file a lawsuit \"to fight for a breath of air.\" Last summer, Sun Damei of Sun Village (which was then an enemy-occupied area), an influential person in the village, had a case of land pawn with his nephew. The village chief, in handling the case, said that his contract was \"bullshit.\" So he seized on this point and said, \"Private matters are based on contracts, official matters are based on seals.\" You say mine is \"bullshit,\" I must have the county magistrate take a look at it.\" So, after going through the district office, all the way to the county, he insisted on this point. After we explained that his contract could be used as evidence, he deflated. Then we explained to him, \"Village cadres are workers and peasants, our own people, who speaks without thinking!\" After explaining the reasoning, he accepted the mediation. If we do not calmly allow the parties to vent what they consider to be grievances in such lawsuits arising from resentment, where people are \"willing to sell two mu of land to fight for a breath of air\" and \"would rather have less things than have their name unmentioned,\" we will not only fail to find the center of the problem, but even extend it to other parts. As the saying goes, \"When your Qi is smooth, you can cross mountains and seas,\" which means that one cannot convince the parties unless the reasoning is clear.\n\n    (3) Issues of Methods and Approaches in Mediation\n\n    \"Even if you have a good heart, it's useless if your methods are bad.\" So methods and approaches are shortcuts to help us succeed in mediation. In the process of mediation, it is best to talk individually first, and encourage the parties to make requests and solutions. In explaining or refuting, avoid having both parties present at the same time (if necessary, it is possible), because \"people have faces, trees have bark,\" and some places cannot stand criticism. Before the government comes forward to mediate, others should do it first. If the mediation fails, then participate in the mediation. Sometimes others can be effective. For example, in the matter of divorce and alimony, the woman often asks for a lot and the man pays less. We must explain the actual difficulties, specific examples, and educate both parties, persuade her to reduce it as much as possible, and encourage her to remarry as soon as possible. As long as we grasp the spirit of policies and laws, the problem will be resolved harmoniously.\n\n    Methods are not rigid dogmas, and should be used flexibly. For example, in the land dispute between Han Zhang and Chen Yuquan, due to stubborn adherence to the old methods (believing that money is omnipotent and can solve everything), although Chen Yuquan was reasonable and from a wealthy family, the mediator mobilized Chen Yuquan to give 3,000 yuan to Han Zhang in order to resolve the problem without going to court, and the case was closed. Afterwards, Han Zhang and some people reflected and said, \"Chen Yuquan was still unreasonable! He is not stupid, why would he give money if he was in the right!?\" We should abandon this kind of superficial style of \"solving the problem for the sake of solving the problem\" without solving ideological problems and without education.\n\n    The mediator is best recommended by the parties themselves (they only believe in the people they find themselves). Based on our experience, marriage issues are handled by cadres from the Youth League and Women's Federation, family inheritance is handled by parents, land disputes are handled by neighbors and peasant association chairmen, and cases involving the military are handled by military leaders. It is not necessary for cadres to handle everything (because some ordinary people do not believe in village cadres). \"All impartial persons who are familiar with the incident, are eager to do good, and are relatives and friends are acceptable\" (see Border Region Government Order). The appearance that emerges should be public if it is public, and private if it is private. Do not adhere to conventions. As for the number of people, it can be determined according to the complexity of the case and the opinions of the parties.\n\n    After mediation, it is necessary to write three or four copies of the mediation agreement (one each for the original and defendant parties, the mediator, and the file), because the masses believe that \"this piece of paper (referring to the mediation agreement) is more important than a contract.\" This is an indispensable procedure. The content should be written in their own words, but it must state the cause of the dispute, the process and method of resolution, the opinions of both parties on the mediation, the time and place of the mediation, and the signatures and seals (or fingerprints) of the mediator and the parties to be appropriate.\n\n    (4) Listen to Feedback After Mediation\n\n    \"Mediation\" is a good way for us to solve problems for the masses, but with a little carelessness, it is easy to misunderstand public opinion. Therefore, it is necessary to listen to the feedback of the masses after mediation as a lesson for the future. For example, when the land pawn case in Sun Village was concluded, Sun Damei said, \"I will never do anything for the enemy again.\" His nephew also expressed his intention to join the guerrilla group. After the democratic discussion of the land dispute in Gongjia Village, the head of the family said, \"Our village is like one person, everyone knows who is good and who is bad!\" Last winter, in dealing with marriage issues during the disaster year, we had to take care of the difficulty of poor peasants getting married and also take care of the woman's willingness. Based on this principle, in the second half of last year alone, out of the 96 cases we handled, 28 women returned to their former husbands, 51 women remained with their later husbands, and 17 women found other partners. These were all mediated after educating both parties. As the masses reflected, \"The government is just capable, and always makes both sides happy.\" But we also have failed lessons. Last July, we mediated the business dispute between Xi Yinsheng and Kong Fanshu. The district and village both said that Xi Yinsheng was \"unreasonable,\" and we also said that he was unreasonable. Later, it was reluctantly mediated. Although Xi Yinsheng got another sum of money, he still looked sad and did not smile. Soon, a local worker wrote a letter saying, \"The handling was inappropriate.\" Who was wronged? It is still not clear, and this is worth examining.\n\n    In short, our mediation has already gained the praise of the masses: \"In the past, a lawsuit meant ten years of hatred, but now the more lawsuits are fought, the more harmonious they become.\"\n\n    These are just some fragmented experiences, which are far from our requirements. We hope to offer a humble opinion and discuss further. (June 1, 1946, at the Cixian County Judicial Section)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 调解民事案的经验\n索麟\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　调解民事案的经验\n    索麟\n    “调解是司法工作中民事案件（个别刑案）的群众路线”。\n    磁县司法科，去年前半年收结七十六个民事案件，即有七十五个调解结案。后半年共收一百七十四案，除二十七案未结外，只有二案上诉（上诉后也经专署调解结案）。由此说明调解方针是完全正确的。“调解”是一种细致的坚苦的说服教育工作，所以调解并不比判决容易，写判决只要根据讯问、辩论、及案情和法令，不管双方接受与否迳可下判；而调解的话是为了加强群众团结，所以要在双方自愿的原则下消除矛盾，就必需摸中当事人的心理，揭发他的企图，在政治上，教育方式上注意，才会使双方心悦诚服。所以在进行调解时要注意下面事项：\n    （一）事前要有充分准备\n    对双方当事人的性情、要求、家庭状况及整个案情，事前要有精密的调查，方能在调解中依据法令和事实，进行驳斥与解释，防止要求过高或过低，这是决定调解成败的关键。如巩家庄巩兴正与其弟媳巩周氏的土地纠纷，经过调查，发觉某些村干部偏擅巩兴正本位主义，怕土地跑出去，再加巩周氏是个好骂街的婆娘，邻舍对他不满，巩兴正又是“人齐家旺”，所以大家“扶竹竿不扶井绳）（扶有势之人）。巩周氏的后台，是她娘家兄弟周有贵，所以在了解案情中，就应先了解这些，才能正确的审识与分析材料，否则易受蒙蔽怨屈一方。再如小商人乔立业与王荣晋等，因营业账差一案，认识到这伙人的一般特性是“爱沾便宜”，就抓紧这点，劝道双方，事后不但没有记仇，反能当即订立货单，继续搞买卖。\n    （二）发现争执焦点应用民主讨论\n    在个别讯问或谈话中，应找出双方争执的焦点。这时我们的态度一定要冷静和蔼，一个没有打过官司的农民或工人，他说话是会累赘的，尤其是妇女“麻包”“线蛋”也要说出来，有时离题会远，我们可以从中插问诱导，万不可板起面孔，否则他们“有话不敢说”，你就不易了解他的苦楚，更难找见争执之中心，调解就会因失去掌握中心而遭破裂。例如上述巩家庄土地案，实系一继承问题，而出现的面貌却是争执大门口七分地，经年余累讼，先后经过五次调解（家长一次、村干二次、区上二次），牵连十二位管理人，由开始的争执七分地小事，经过调解后，不是“小事化没事”，而是“小事化大事”，更波及到东山上的二亩多地，最后还提出重新分家。这完全是由原管人（一二村干部）的偏擅，和区署未发见争执焦点，激起双方提出更大问题。但在发现上边情况之后，将有所管理人及巩周氏的后台周有贵，在个别谈话后展开民主讨论，认识了好赖人，揭穿别人企图提出问题的中心，结果双方心平气静的接受了调解。\n    找不出问题中心是会把小事弄成大事的，“为争一口气”而打起官司来是常有的。去年夏天，孙庄（当时是敌占区）孙大美（村上有头脸的人），与其侄儿因典当土地一案就是村长在处理时，说了一句他的文约是“狗屁”，于是他就抓住这点说：“私凭文约、官凭印信”，你说我这是“狗屁”，我非叫县长看看不行”，所以经过区署，一直闹到县里，他就坚持这一点。在我们说明他的文约可以为凭后，他就泄气了，再向他解释“村干部是工农人，自己人，谁说话还下着线呢！”讲清道理之后，他才接受调解。这种“为争一口气，卖上二亩地”，“宁叫东西少，不叫名不在”的因负气而起的诉讼，我们如果不平心静气的让当事人把他认为的怨屈，倾吐出来，不仅找不到问题的中心，甚至扩大及于其他部分。俗语说“气顺山海过”，他的意思就是说，非将道理讲清，不足以说服当事人。\n    （三）调解中的方式方法问题\n    “纵然你有好心肠，方法不好也枉然”。所以方法方式是辅助我们调解成功的捷径。在调解过程中，最好先个别谈话，启发当事人提出要求和解决办法，在解释或驳斥中，忌讳双方同在（必要时也可以），因为“人有脸、树有皮”某些地方是受不起批评的。在政府出面调解之前，应先由别人进行，调解不成时，再参与调解，有时别人是会有作用的。比如离婚包赡养费一事，往往女方要求高男方出的少，我们就要把实际困难、具体例子、教育双方，说服她尽量减少，劝她及早改嫁都是可以的，只要我们掌握政策法令的精神，问题就会和美解决。\n    方法不是呆板的教条，应灵活运用，如韩张氏与陈玉川的土地纠纷，由于固执旧法（认为银钱万能包钱了事），虽陈玉川有理而家境优越，所以调解人动员陈玉川，为了解决问题不打官司，拿出三千元给韩张氏而结案，事后韩张氏和一部分人反映说：“还是陈玉川没理！他又不呆、有理为啥又出钱！？”这种不解决思想问题，不加以教育的“为解决问题，而解决问题”的虚浮作风应该戒除。\n    调解人最好由当事人自己荐举（只有他自己找出来的人，他才相信），根据我们经验婚姻问题由青、妇会干部，家庭继承由家长，土地纠葛由地邻、农会长，涉及部队的由部队首长，什么案件，什么人调解，不一定非干部不行（因为有些老百姓不大相信村干部），“凡熟悉事件急公好义的公正人士，亲戚邻友都可”（见边府令）。出现的面貌，该公就公、该私就私、不要墨守成规，至于人数的多寡，可视案件的复杂与当事人的意见而定。\n    在调解后一定要缮写调解书三份或四份（原被双方、调解人、存卷应各一张），因群众认为：“这张纸（指调解书而言）比文约还要紧”，这是必不可少的手续。内容就用他们自己的话，写出来就行了，但必须载明争执之事由、解决的经过和办法，双方对调解的意见，调解的时间、地点，调解人及当事人签名盖章（或盖指印）才为妥贴。\n    （四）调解后要听取反映\n    “调解”是我们为群众排难解纷的好办法，但少有不慎，容易误会民意，所以调解之后倾听群众反映，作为以后借镜，大有必要。如孙庄土地典当一案，结案时，孙大美即说：“回去决不做敌人的事”。其侄亦表示参加游击小组。巩家庄的土地纠纷在民主讨论之后，家长说：“俺村像一个人一样，谁好谁坏，他都知道！”在去冬处理灾荒年婚姻问题，既要照顾贫农结婚困难，又要照顾女方自愿。我们用这个原则，光去年后半年，处理的九十六件中，有二十八个女人返回前夫，五十一个女人仍归后夫，十七个女人另找了对象，这都是经过对双方教育后才调解的。诚如群众反映：“政府就是有办法，总要叫两头都如意。”但我们也有失败的教训，去年七月调解席银生与孔凡枢的营商纠葛一案，区、村都说席银生“没理”，我们也说他没理，后来勉强调解了，虽然席银生又得了一部款子，可是他仍苦丧着脸，没有笑色，不久当地工作员写来一封信说：“处理不适当”。究竟谁冤？到底还不清楚，这是很值得检查的。\n    总之我们的调解，在群众中已经获得：“以前一场官司，十年仇，如今越打官司越和气”的好评。\n    这仅是一些片断的经验，离我们的要求还远，希望能抛砖引玉，再作磋商。（一九四六、六、一、于磁县司法科）"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th -- Moscow, 10th -- Commentator Masinu, in a commentary on the first anniversary of the Red Army's liberation of Manchuria, pointed out: The Red Army's strike in the East opened up prospects for peaceful development for the Chinese people. However, various forces exist both inside and outside China that are unwilling to see the collapse of Japanese imperialism. As soon as World War II ended, these forces began to act on a large scale. The recent incident at Tokyo Railway Station in Japan, where Japanese police shot and killed Chinese people under the supervision of the U.S. military, more clearly illustrates this situation. The actions of Japanese reactionary forces against the Chinese people, in coordination with the Chinese reactionary forces waging civil war, are certainly not accidental. The incident of Japanese police, under U.S. military supervision, shooting Chinese people and the incident of Chinese reactionary forces using U.S. planes to bomb Yan'an precisely echo each other. Chinese newspapers point out that the phenomenon of Japanese militarism's revival is a result of the United States' lenient policy toward Japan. British and American newspapers even point out that America's assistance to the Kuomintang in carrying out civil war will help Japanese aggressors rise again. An American afternoon newspaper reporter stated: \"Americans verbally endorse peace, but their weapons and money are influencing the war.\" A British magazine reporter wrote: \"In recent months, the prospect of establishing a coalition government in China has been increasingly weakened. The Kuomintang authorities are waging civil war, and they are able to do so because they rely on direct American assistance. The civil war provoked by the Kuomintang reactionaries will help Japanese aggressors re-invade China and will cultivate new aggressive forces for Japanese imperialism. To prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, the primary reliance is on the Chinese people to eliminate civil war and achieve unity and democracy.\"\n\nMasinu continued: What conditions are needed to achieve democracy and unity in China? On this question, Carlsson, a Marine Corps officer out of service, said: As long as American armed forces remain in China and continue to provide financial and economic assistance to the Nanjing government, the dominant reactionary forces of the Kuomintang will never take positive steps to establish a coalition government, and only such a government can guarantee China's peace and the possibility of China's peaceful development. The fundamental point is to stop foreign interference. Chinese and American newspapers are calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, and this demand has been particularly strengthened recently. The reason for the U.S. military's presence in China has disappeared, as the work of repatriating Japanese troops was officially declared complete on July 15.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努发表评论称  美应即停止干涉中国  中国内战将使日本侵略者抬头\n\n1946-08-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努发表评论称            \n    美应即停止干涉中国         \n    中国内战将使日本侵略者抬头\n　　【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科十日广播：评论员马西努论红军解放满洲一周年时指出：红军在东方的打击，为中国人民打开了和平发展的前途，可是中国国内外存在着各种力量，不愿意日本帝国主义崩溃。第二次世界大战一结束，这种力量即大事活动起来，不久前在美军监督下的日本东京火车站所发生日警枪杀中国人的事件，更明显的说明了这一局势。日本反动势力反对中国人民的行动与中国反动力量进行内战的配合，当然不是偶然的。美军监督下的日警枪杀中国人与中国反动力量使用美机轰炸延安的事件，恰是遥相呼应。中国报纸指出日本军国主义的复活现象是美国对日本宽大政策的结果，英美报纸更指出美国的帮助国民党进行内战，将帮助日本侵略者的再起。美国下午报记者称：“美国人在口头上赞成和平，可是他们的武器与金钱却在影响战争”。英国一杂志记者写道：“最近几月，在中国建立联合政府的前途已日益减弱，国民党当局在进行内战，其所以能如此，是有美国的直接帮助为依靠。国民党反动派所挑起的内战，将帮助日本侵略者重新侵略中国，将培植日本帝国主义新的侵略力量。预防日本军国主义的复兴，首先是依靠中国人民消灭内战与达到统一和民主。”\n    马西努继称：达到中国的民主与统一需要那些条件呢？对这一问题，在野的美海军陆战队卡尔逊说道：当美国武装力量还停留在中国，并继续给南京政府财政与经济帮助时，国民党占优势的反动势力决不会采取积极的步骤建立联合政府，而只有这样的政府才能保证中国的和平与民主中国和平发展的可能性。根本的一点，是停止外国的干涉。中美报纸都要求美军从中国撤退，最近以来这种要求特别加强了。美军驻在中国的理由已消失，因为遣送日军的工作早已在七月十五日正式宣告结束。"

North of the Songhua River does not grow cotton, and coupled with the exploitation by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years, the vast majority of people are scantily clad. Baiquan, Hailun, Keshan, Qingcheng and other counties in the province are flax producing areas, with Keshan being the most well-known. Currently, the provincial democratic government, in addition to taking Kedong as a demonstration area and providing substantial assistance and organization for the people to spin flax, has specially appointed Mr. An Jicang, who has worked in flax factories for twelve years and is now an administrative committee member of the provincial government, to engage in research on flax spinning machines. Mr. An comes from a working-class background, has rich experience, and is very enthusiastic about this matter. He recently went to Hailun and other places to investigate various machines, working and living with the workers there, and then began to cast molds and manufacture based on the machine drawings he had collected over the years. He personally melted iron and turned sand to manufacture the more than 5,000 parts needed, sometimes eating only one meal a day. After several months of effort, a prototype of a fifteen-head flax spinning machine has emerged. Mr. An is now further researching and refining the machine with joy, in order to further improve the machine and make it into a forty-head flax spinning machine. It is reported that after this type of machine is manufactured, each machine can spin 720 jin of flax yarn per day, which will be of great benefit to the development of the flax textile industry in the province.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黑龙江发动纺织亚麻安吉仓先生制纺织机\n\n1946-08-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黑龙江发动纺织亚麻安吉仓先生制纺织机\n    【新华社齐齐哈尔十一日电】黑龙江省民主政府，近发动人民用亚麻纺线织布解决穿衣问题。因松花江以北不长棉花，加以十四年来敌伪盘剥，广大人民衣不掩体。而该省之拜泉、海伦、克山、庆城等县均为亚麻产地，并以克山为著。现该省民主政府，除将以克东为示范区，大量帮助与组织人民纺织亚麻外，并特约曾在亚麻工厂工作十二年现为省府行政委员之安吉仓先生，从事亚麻纺织机之研究。安先生系工人出身，经验丰富，对此事甚为热心。近赴海伦等地考查各种机械，在那里亲自上班作工和工友共起居，然后参考自己多年所收藏之机器图样开始铸模制造。所需五千多零件他亲自融铁翻沙制造，有时一天只吃一顿饭。经数月努力，一部十五个头的亚麻纺织机的雏型已经出现。现安先生正以欢快的心情进一步研究和修整，以使机器更加改进而能制成四十个头的亚麻纺织机。据悉：此种机器制成后，每架机器日可纺七百二十斤麻线，对全省亚麻纺织业之开展，将有重大利益。"

    "content": "Two Hundred Thousand People Swept Up in the Tidal Wave of Emancipation\n    The Mass Movement in Anyang Spreads Like Wildfire\n    Rationally Distributing the Fruits of Struggle, Everyone in Xijishan Has Land to Cultivate\n    [Report from Our Newspaper in Anyang] The liquidation and emancipation movement of the masses in the new district of Anyang is continuing to develop vigorously and deeply. Because the cadres at all levels resolutely implemented the county party committee's resolution, mobilized the vast middle peasants, and united the entire peasant masses to advance towards the feudal forces, the scale of the movement is unprecedentedly grand. The leadership seized upon the current urgent demands of the masses and re-rationally distributed the fruits, starting from the liquidation of the burdens shifted onto the peasants by the feudal clique under the eight years of enemy and puppet rule. This opened up the situation for the movement, and the movement spread universally like a prairie fire. In the first half of July, among the 420 natural villages in the new district (excluding those who stubbornly resisted), 300 had already launched heated struggles. The movement in villages such as Xijishan, Fucheng, Xiqingliu, Qingyu, and Dongzhangwu developed best. Even Xizizhen Village and Shuangquan Village, where the reactionary forces were strongest during the previous riot of secret societies, opened up the situation. The number of households participating in the movement in the county reached 80% to 90%, with more than 200,000 people. Many masses locked their doors and participated in the accusations with their whole families. Under the storm of the masses' emancipation, the lackeys and henchmen disintegrated and broke apart, and the previously powerful feudal ruling clique and special agents were isolated and forced to lower their heads, quickly spitting out their spoils. Many villages set up sheds and held struggle meetings, with shouts and arguments filling the air, extremely tense and lively. In the movement, the poor peasants were particularly active. Some rich peasants and workers from the Guantai Coal Mine also participated in the struggle. The daughter-in-law of the local tyrant and landlord Li Xiaofeng from Shuiye also went to accuse him of his crimes. In Fucheng, 840 out of 932 households made accusations at the meetings. The masses forgot their hunger and fatigue. The Tongyeqiao Village spoke for a whole day and night, and the meeting did not end until dawn. The Shijian Village spoke for three consecutive days and still hadn't finished. Many \"honest peasants\" rushed to pour out their grievances. The more \"honest\" they were, the more grievances they poured out. Many villages accused as a whole family. Old women beat the local tyrants and traitors with crutches as they accused them. Little children cried loudly as they accused them, demanding the mother who had been forced to death. The emotions of the masses were exceptionally indignant and high. The results of the movement were extremely good. The peasants of Xijishan had legally recovered more than 1,700 mu of land, eliminating poverty and extreme poverty. The ideological consciousness of the masses has been universally improved. When they went to recover the spoils, they all said in unison: \"Let's go, let's get our things back!\" The masses in Fucheng wore the clothes returned by the landlords and local tyrants and danced the Yangko everywhere with excitement, singing the emancipation song: \"After settling the accounts of eight years of blood and tears, we will not forget the Communist Party when we are emancipated.\" Qingyu immediately adapted the struggle stories into an emancipation opera and performed it on stage. The masses said: \"This is truly a complete emancipation!\"\n    In the large-scale liquidation movement, the leadership strongly supported the masses and made decisions for them, replacing the speculative elements and dog-leg cadres, while a large number of activists who truly served the masses were elected by the masses as struggle heroes, replacing the bad elements and taking up leadership positions; Fucheng, with more than 900 households, elected more than 130 struggle heroes. The dog-leg bad elements were also purged from the peasant association and militia, and new blood was absorbed. A large number of middle peasants, honest peasants, and women poured into the peasant association. The number of male and female members of the peasant association in Fucheng surged to more than 1,500, accounting for 40% of the village's population. In seven villages in the Third District, the number of peasant association members accounted for 66% of the total population, and in 45 villages in the Second District, it accounted for more than 40%. The militia in Fucheng surged from 50 to more than 150, almost accounting for 4% of the village's population. In the Second District, 150 people were purged and 321 were added, bringing the total to 948, accounting for 2% of the district's population.\n    The masses, remembering the source of their good fortune, unanimously said: \"Good times only came after the Eighth Route Army came.\" When distributing the fruits of struggle, some listed the families of revolutionary martyrs as the first priority, and some raised them by one level. Some paid special attention to taking care of honorably discharged soldiers. An honorably discharged soldier in Tongye Village was allocated six mu of land.

On the evening of the 7th, over a hundred factory managers, technicians, and others from various industries in Zhangjiakou gathered at the Municipal Government Club to discuss issues related to industrial development and construction. Mayor Yang Chunpu and others were present to listen. Shan Yongmao, manager of Deshenghua Fur Company, cited facts to illustrate that, with the support of loans and marketing assistance from the democratic government, the number of wool and leather manufacturers in Zhangjiakou had rapidly recovered from over twenty to over one hundred in the past six months. He suggested that, in order to rationally utilize the abundant local wool production, a large-scale mechanized wool weaving factory should be jointly established by both public and private sectors. Zhang Ji, manager of the Peace Construction Company, stated that, because the liberated areas' market was not flooded with foreign goods and people's purchasing power was very strong, the development of national industry became possible. The factory had successfully trial-produced a battery, producing 500 barrels of dry cell batteries, 200 cylinders of communication batteries, and 20 large barrels of radio batteries daily, which still could not meet the demand. In contrast, the few battery factories in cities like Peiping and Tianjin had almost all closed down due to the dumping of American goods. Manager Li of Yu@ Flour Company reported that the factory's monthly machine-milled flour production had now increased to over 12,000 bags, and they planned to expand operations to over 20,000 bags soon. He felt greatly encouraged by the various excellent measures taken by the democratic government to protect and develop national industry.

    "date": "1946-08-15",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Anti-\"Sixty Jin\" and \"Political Siege\"\n    Jin Sha, Zhu Xiang\n\n    The most hated reactionary force of the people of Yuanqu was the \"Sixty Jin.\" This originated from the enemy puppet regulations: pseudo-village \"cadres\" could extort sixty jin of fine grain from the masses each month, and the masses collectively called these bad people \"Sixty Jin.\" Some people ate several sixty jin, called \"Big Sixty Jin.\" Almost all of these people were local bullies and feudal landlords, who relied on enemy power in the village to make a fortune, arbitrarily detaining and hanging up the masses, or accusing the masses of \"communicating with the Eighth Route Army,\" sending them to the enemy to be shot or buried alive. A Yuanqu folk song says: \"Not afraid of King Yama, just afraid of Sixty Jin.\"\n\n    Yuanqu County Town was a stronghold of traitors, spies, and feudal landlords, and the headquarters of all the large and small \"Sixty Jin\" in the county. Yao Huaisheng and Yao Hesheng, nephews of the big landlord Yao Sen, served as the chief of the Finance and Grain Section and the chief of the Construction Section of the pseudo-county government, respectively, and were the main founders of the \"Sixty Jin\" system. They often personally led people to the countryside to force grain and money, detaining and beating people, and taking large amounts of bribes. When Tanjiacun suffered a famine the year before last, because they had no money to bribe them, they were \"promoted\" from a third-class village to a first-class village, and extorted double the amount. Many farmers had even the few grains they snatched from the locusts mouths plundered, leading to a large number of people fleeing the famine, begging for food, and starving to death.\n\n    They also took advantage of the disaster to make usurious loans that devoured people. The most common \"kettle interest\": interest rates reached three sheng of wheat per month for one yuan. There was also a \"sleep interest\": money was lent out without urging or demanding, and when the time was right, the \"interest\" was suddenly calculated, and the debtor's land and property were all taken away. Yao Ganchen's lending shop \"He Shang Tai\" didn't know how many farmers it ruined. At that time, the folk saying was: \"Not owing He Shang Tai is like being a living god.\" The fertile water land in the east, west, and north of Hezao Beitoutou was almost entirely in the bloody hands of the Yao, Li, and Shi families. Yao Ganchen alone plundered more than a thousand mu of good land.\n\n    During the period when the enemy in the city and the large and small \"Sixty Jin\" in the county ruled Yuanqu, more than 19,200 people out of the county's population of 60,000 were killed, murdered, forced to death, or starved to death. In the second district, with a population of 20,000, the population was reduced by half due to death and escape. In an ancient well in the district, more than 200 peasant corpses were found, bloody and horrible. Many rural fields became a desolate world where roads were broken and people were scarce, and weeds were taller than houses. The only hope of the people of Yuanqu was that the Eighth Route Army would come to take revenge. The masses in the Tanjiacun area said: \"The Eighth Route Army will come to settle accounts!\" This represents the voice of the people of the whole county.\n\n    After our army liberated Yuanqu last year, it resoundingly put forward the slogan of anti-\"Sixty Jin.\" The revolutionary movement of the people of the whole county against \"Sixty Jin\" was kicked off with a memorial service for the martyrs who died during the War of Resistance and a public trial of the traitor Liu Yanlin, and it was in full swing. The masses forgot the wind and snow of December, forgot fatigue and hunger, and launched struggles in various places day and night without rest. Villages such as Dongxihezao, Gaoluo, and Gao Yige were fighting even on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Many \"Sixty Jin\" deeply lowered their heads and begged the masses to spare their humble lives. Some stubborn guys were made to wear tall hats and paraded through \"nine villages\" and \"four gates,\" shouting their own crimes. Most of them readily admitted to compensating the masses for all losses. The masses, holding swords and guns, went out in groups, in the middle of the night, to capture secret agents, even chasing them to Wenxi, Xiaxian, Yangcheng and other places, and brought them back for struggle and public trial. A large number of documents and contracts were pasted into \"thousand-jin pagodas\" (symbolizing the heavy pressure suffered by the peasants) and burned in parades and demonstrations. Many villages established \"Liberation Days\" and created liberation operas, with gongs and drums beating loudly, celebrating the new life. By March, 71 of the 77 villages in the county had entered the climax of the movement.\n\n    The rule of the \"Sixty Jin\" in the countryside collapsed, but the ruling stronghold of traitors, bullies, and feudal landlords in the city still weighed heavily on the people. Some put seals on their doors, and they had automatically carried out fake struggles that stole the sky and changed the sun, saying that they had been \"liquidated,\" but the eyes of the people were discerning and could not be deceived. In March, more than 300 people from the seven villages led by Tanjiacun went to the city to settle accounts with the landlords Yao, Xi, and Li families. At this time, the traitor landlords were prepared. On the one hand, they forced the restaurants in the streets not to sell food to the masses of the seven villages, claiming to starve these 300 people to death. On the other hand, Wang Xinheng, the head of the special agents, used the struggle against \"Sixty Jin\" Zhao Zhenhua as a pretext to deceive more than 600 people from the five riverside villages of Dongtan and Saili, and armed them to enter the city. They fabricated news, telling these 600 people that the villagers of the seven villages were bandits and wanted to \"rob\" the landlords, so that other villages could not reduce rent and clear debts; after provocation, they threatened them with \"whoever leaves will be fined.\" Finally, led by the special agents, the masses of the seven villages were locked in a large courtyard and besieged. The \"Sixty Jin\" stood guard at all intersections, not allowing pedestrians to enter or leave. The masses of the seven villages were drenched in cold rain, enduring hunger and cold, waiting for reinforcements. The traitorous special agent landlords, fearing that the masses would not freeze and starve to death for a while, led the crowd to shout and curse loudly, throwing bricks and stones into the courtyard, causing many people to be cut and bleed.\n\n    This situation continued for a day and a night, and the reactionary ferocity reached its peak. The county government and the county farmers association, located outside the city, learned that the masses of the seven villages were surrounded and immediately issued an emergency call to the peasants of the whole county to promote class friendship, support the masses of the seven villages, and attack the reactionary stronghold in the city. The peasants shouted slogans such as \"Farmers of the world are one family,\" \"Saving others is saving ourselves,\" and \"Not letting the landlords and secret agents harm their own brothers,\" and more than 5,000 people automatically picked up various weapons and organized propaganda teams, combat teams, search teams, and transport teams to surround and advance towards Yuanqu City. On March 29, three columns of the peasant army, in a mighty manner, arrived at the outskirts of the city overnight. Two thousand people were deployed along the Yellow River to maintain vigilance, preparing to strike at the stubborn army on the opposite bank at any time, and three thousand people, holding torches high, climbed the walls and entered the city. The city head of Yuanqu suddenly shone with light. The \"Sixty Jin\" fled, hid, and even disappeared without a trace. After the peasants merged with the surrounded masses of the seven villages, they immediately separated to search. People armed with guns and torches were running everywhere in the streets and alleys, and Yaojia Lane (i.e., Landlord Lane) was even more crowded with people.\n\n    For the first time, the peasants, as masters, opened and entered the black lacquered gate of the big landlord Yao Ganchen, and entered the lending shop \"He Shang Tai.\" They smashed the \"ticket plates\" for printing paper money into pieces, and tore the famous paintings with sandalwood inlaid edges. Eating high-quality grain and living in high-rise buildings, they shouted, \"This is all our blood! You've enjoyed enough!\"\n\n    Ten thousand bright eyes and strong hands searched out the trembling traitor Yao Hesheng, the special agent Wang Xinheng and other leading figures, and more than a dozen lackeys such as Yang Dengyun, from the caves. After four consecutive days of large-scale joint accusations, the two main criminals - the enemy agent and national agent Yao Hesheng and Wang Xinheng - were executed according to law under public trial by the masses, and the secondary lackeys confessed and repented. For those who confessed well, the masses shouted: \"Be lenient with him!\"\n\n    The victorious peasants were extremely happy! Meetings were held during the day and operas were performed at night. The troupes and propaganda teams of various villages put this struggle on the stage for public performance. \"Special agents armed to surround and beat the masses\" and \"bad people sabotage, good people are deceived\" on the stage, and \"Yao Huaisheng's crimes\" in Shangzhuang, deeply educated the masses themselves. In particular, the masses of the five riverside villages who had been deceived said after seeing these operas that they had previously been \"stuck in a gourd, unable to distinguish between enemies and friends.\"\n\n    What the peasants of Yuanqu are most proud of is not only that the reactionary ruling clique of Yuanqu City was completely smashed, but even the Chiang Kai-shek pseudo-army on the opposite bank of the Yellow River, which often harassed and strafed us, was frightened and did not dare to fire a single shot for four days and four nights. Although the masses' gongs and drums were loud, singing loudly, and the torches were burning red in the sky, the target was very prominent and clear. When they mentioned this victorious joint struggle, a victorious smile appeared on their faces, and together with the military siege when the Eighth Route Army liberated Yuanqu last September, it was resoundingly called \"political siege.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反“六十斤”与“政治攻城”\n金沙　朱襄\n1946-08-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反“六十斤”与“政治攻城”\n    金沙、朱襄\n    垣曲人民最痛恨的反动势力是“六十斤”。原来依照敌伪规定：伪村“干部”每人每月可向群众盘剥六十斤细粮，群众统称这些坏人为“六十斤”。其中有一人吃好几个六十斤的，称为“大六十斤”。这些人几乎全部都是恶霸及封建地主，在村里倚仗敌势，大发洋财，随意扣押吊打群众，或者给群众扣上个“通八路”的罪名，送到敌人手里，枪毙或活埋。垣曲民谣说：“不怕阎罗王，就怕六十斤。”\n    垣曲县城，是汉奸、特务、封建地主的堡垒，是全县大小“六十斤”的首脑部。大地主姚森的侄子姚怀生、姚和生，分任伪县府财粮科长与建设科长，是“六十斤”制度的主要创始者。他们时常亲自率人下乡，逼粮逼款，扣人打人，从中掠取大量的贿赂。谭家村前年灾荒时，因无钱买贿他们，被从三等村“提升”为头等村，加倍勒索，许多农民连从煌虫嘴里抢出来的几颗粮食都被掠夺一空，以致大批逃荒、讨饭、饿毙。\n    他们更利用灾荒，大放吃人的高利贷。最普遍的“棵儿利”：利率有达到一块钱一月三升麦子的。另外有一种“磕睡利”：放出钱去，不催不讨，待到一定时机，突然“加利”一算，将债户土地财产一齐算光。姚干臣开设的放账铺“和尚泰”，不知“坑”穷了多少农民。当时民谚说：“不欠和尚泰，就是活神仙。”东、西河糟北堡头一带的肥沃水地，几乎全部落在姚家、李家、师家的血手了。只姚干臣一家掠得好地就在千亩以上。\n    在城内敌人和全县大小“六十斤”统治垣曲时期，全县六万人口，竟有一万九千二百多人被屠杀、暗害、逼死、饿死。二区两万人口，连死带逃减少一半，该区一古井内，曾发现农民尸首二百多具，血肉模糊，惨不忍睹。好多农村田野，变成了路断人稀，野草与房屋比高的荒凉世界。垣曲人民唯一的希望，就是八路军来了报仇。潭家村一带群众说：“八路军来了算账！”这代表着全县人民的心声。\n    我军于去年解放垣曲后，响亮提出反“六十斤”的口号。全县人民反“六十斤”的革命运动，以两万群众追悼抗战期间死难烈士及公审汉奸刘延林为序幕，如火如荼地开展起来。群众忘记了腊月的风雪，忘记了疲劳与饥饿，夜以继日，丝毫不休息地在各地展开了斗争。东西河槽、皋落、高倚阁等村，则连大年初一都在斗争。许多“六十斤”深深地低下了头，请求群众保留他们卑贱的生命。有些顽固家伙被戴上高帽游“九村”，“游四门”，自己喊自己的罪状。多数都满口承认赔偿群众一切损失。群众拿着宝剑和刀枪，成群结队，半夜三更的四出捕捉特务，甚至追到闻喜、夏县、阳城等地，把他们抓了回来，进行斗争与公审。大量的文书契约，被糊成“千斤塔”（象征农民所受重压），烧毁于游行示威之中。许多村庄订立了“翻身日”，创作出翻身戏，锣鼓喧天，庆祝着新生。至阳历三月，全县七十七村有七十一村进入运动高潮。\n    农村中的“六十斤”统治垮台了，但城内的汉奸恶霸、封建地主统治堡垒，却仍然沉重地压在人民身上。有的把门上贴了封条，他们曾自动进行偷天换日的假斗争，说是已经“清算”过了，但人民的眼睛是雪亮的，欺骗不了的。三月，以谭家村为首的上七村群众三百多人，进城找姚家、席家、李家地主算账。此时，汉奸地主们早有准备，一面强迫各街饭铺不准卖饭给上七村群众，声言要饿死这三百多人，一面由特务头子王新恒借斗争“六十斤”赵振华为名，欺骗了东滩、塞里等沿河五村群众六百余人，拿着武器入城。他们捏造消息，告诉这六百多人说，上七村的庄户是土匪，要“抢劫”地主，使别村不能减租清债；挑拨之后，又以“谁走就罚谁”来威吓，最后由特务带头，把上七村群众关到一个大院，围困起来。各路口都由“六十斤”站了岗，不准行人出入，上七村群众被冷雨淋着，忍冻受饿的等待援军。汉奸特务地主们生怕群众一时冻饿不死，乃率众高喊大骂，向院里打砖块，打石头，打得好些群众皮破血流。\n    这局面延续了一天一夜，反动凶焰达到了顶点。住在城外的县政府、县农会获悉上七村群众被围消息，立即紧急号召全县农民发扬阶级友爱，支援上七村群众，向城内反动堡垒进攻。农民们喊着“天下农民是一家”、“救别人就是救自己”、“不让地主特务伤害自己的兄弟”的口号，五千多人自动拿起各种武器，组织了宣传队、战斗队、搜索队、运输队，向垣曲城包围前进。三月二十九日，三路农民大军浩浩荡荡，连夜进抵城郊。两千人在黄河沿岸布好警戒，准备随时打击对岸的顽军，三千人高擎火把，爬墙进城，垣曲城头，顿放光明。“六十斤”们窜的窜，藏的藏，连影子也不见了，农民们与被包围的上七村群众汇合之后，即刻分头进行搜索。大街、小巷到处奔流着荷枪实弹的人群与火把，姚家巷（即地主巷）内，更是人山人海，挤的水泄不通。\n    农民第一次以主人的姿态打开并进入大地主姚干臣的黑漆大门，进入放账铺“和尚泰”。他们把印刷纸币的“票版”摔成碎块，把檀香木镶边的名画也撕裂了”。吃着上等的粮食，住着高楼大厦，他们嚷叫着：“这都是咱的血呀！你们受用够了！”\n    一万只雪亮的眼和有力的手，从地洞里，把混身发抖的汉奸姚和生、特务王新恒等首脑人物与狗腿杨登云等十余人搜捕出来了。经过连续四天大规模的联合控诉，两个主要罪犯——敌特兼国特姚和生和王新恒在群众公审下，依法处决，次要的狗腿们纷纷坦白悔过。对于坦白得好的，群众高喊：“宽大了他！”\n    胜利了的农民欢喜极了！白天开会，晚上演戏。各村的剧团、宣传队，纷纷将这次斗争搬上舞台公演。上登板的“特务武装围打群众”、“坏人破坏、好人上当”，上庄的“姚怀生的罪恶”，都深深地教育了群众自己。特别是曾经受骗的沿河五村群众，在看到这些戏后，都说自己从前是“被装在葫芦里，分不清敌人和朋友”。\n    垣曲农民最骄傲的，不仅是垣曲城的反动统治集团完全被粉碎，而且连黄河对岸经常向我们扰乱扫射的蒋伪军，都吓得整整四天四夜没敢放一枪。尽管群众锣鼓喧天，高歌欢叫，火把燃得满空通红，目标非常地突出与显明。他们一提起这次胜利的联合斗争，脸上就涌出胜利的微笑，和去年九月八路军解放垣曲时的军事攻城连在一起，响亮地称为“政治攻城”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Shuyang, 12th. A small number of landlord descendants from Northern Jiangsu, who had mistakenly believed reactionary rumors and fled to Zhenjiang, Xinpu, Haizhou, and other places, have now successively returned to the Liberated Areas, unable to endure the oppression and abuse of the Kuomintang authorities and being driven to serve as cannon fodder in the civil war. Four hundred and six fugitive youths have returned to Sishu County, one hundred and twenty-seven have returned to Huaiyin, and tens of people have returned to each of the counties of Lianshui, Guanyun, and Tongyang from the Kuomintang areas. It is said that anyone who fled to Zhenjiang was required by the Kuomintang authorities to register at the \"Refugee Center\" run by Xia Puzhai, the former president of the pseudo-Chamber of Commerce of Siyang, and issued a \"Refugee Certificate\" before being taken in. They lived in dilapidated temples and ate thin gruel of coarse rice twice a day. Old and young, men and women, were all crammed together, and any slight dissatisfaction would be met with beatings and scolding. Those who were relatively wealthy were arbitrarily labeled by the special agents as \"Communist spies\" and extorted tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan. If they refused to pay, they would be imprisoned on the charge of \"colluding with bandits.\" The situation was the same for those who fled to Xinpu, Haizhou, and other places. For example, Zhu Tangchao from Wangji District was extorted twice in Xinpu and imprisoned for eighteen days, all his belongings were confiscated, and he suffered all kinds of hardships before he managed to escape and return home. In Zhenjiang, the Kuomintang authorities established so-called \"Youth Training Classes,\" forcing fugitive youths to undergo military training in preparation for serving as cannon fodder in the civil war. The youths who had been deceived into fleeing suddenly realized this and, recalling the democratic and free life they had lived in the Liberated Areas, compared it to the Kuomintang authorities' all kinds of abuse of the youth, and the difference was like heaven and earth. Regretting their actions, they immediately tried to return home. The governments and people of the Liberated Areas have taken care of those who were deceived and have become aware and returned. After more than ten fugitives from Tonggui (a newly established county located in Mohongzhen, northwest of Shuyang) returned from Xinhai, the local people held a welcome meeting to celebrate their return to the light. The democratic government also immediately returned the land and property rights that had been held in trust on their behalf after they left home. They were moved to tears and unanimously expressed their determination to settle down and build a career in the Liberated Areas and work hard for the construction of the Liberated Areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 受不了国民党的欺压虐待  苏北逃亡地主子弟返乡  政府与人民帮其安家照顾备至\n\n1946-08-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　受不了国民党的欺压虐待            \n    苏北逃亡地主子弟返乡   \n    政府与人民帮其安家照顾备至\n    【新华社沭阳十二日电】误信反动派谣言逃亡镇江、新浦、海州等地之苏北少数地主子弟，因不堪国民党当局欺压虐待及被驱作内战炮灰，现已陆续返回解放区。泗沭县逃亡青年归来四百零六人，淮阴归来一百二十七人，涟水、灌云、潼阳各县自国民党区归来者各有数十人。据说凡逃往镇江者，国民党当局限定必须向前泗阳伪商会会长夏逆朴斋等所主持之“难民所”登记，发给“难民证”始得收留，住的是破庙，吃的是一天两顿糙米稀饭。老幼男女全在一堆，稍有不满，便以打骂相加。较为富有者，则被特务们任意加“八路军密探”等帽子，敲诈十万百万不等，不给则即加“通匪”罪入狱。逃往新浦海州等地者，情形亦同样。如随王集区朱堂钞在新浦被诈索两次，下狱十八天，随身衣物悉被没收，受尽百般苦楚后，始得脱险归来。在镇江国民党当局设立所谓“青年训练班”，强迫逃亡青年受军训，以备充当内战炮灰。被骗逃亡的青年，于此恍然大悟，回想在解放区所过之民主自由生活，与国民党当局对青年之百般虐害相较，判若天涯。悔悟之余，即设法回家。解放区政府与人民，对被骗者的觉悟返回者，多方照顾。潼归（新设县，在沭阳西北莫洪镇）十余逃亡者自新海归来后，当地人民即召开欢迎大会，庆祝他们重见光明。民主政府亦将彼等离家后代为保管之地权财权当即归还原主，彼等感激涕零，一致表示今后决心在解放区安家立业，为解放区建设而努力。"

    "content": "Responding to General Liu Bocheng's Call\n\tWeihe Detachment Helps the Masses to Overthrow Landlords\n\tMasses Enthusiastically Retain Them and Tearfully Bid Farewell Upon Departure\n\t[Our newspaper's report from Heze] The First Battalion of the Weihe Detachment, responding to General Liu Bocheng's call, is now actively helping the masses to overthrow landlords and realize \"land to the tiller.\" In addition to ordering all officers and soldiers to strictly abide by mass discipline, disseminate propaganda, and help the masses, the responsible leaders have also selected 21 lower-level cadres and veteran liberated area soldiers from the battalion to form four civil affairs work groups to go to the sixth and seventh districts of Daokou and Yanjin to help the masses overthrow landlords, aiming to create experience by breaking through at one point. At the beginning, everyone raised difficulties such as \"illiteracy,\" \"lack of experience,\" and \"wearing two-and-a-half chi [unit of measure] uniforms makes it difficult to approach the masses.\" The leaders said: \"As long as you patiently approach the masses, rely on the masses, and work for the masses, these difficulties can be overcome.\" After arriving at their work posts, these comrades quickly integrated with the masses. The majority of the work group comrades were of peasant origin, and although they were illiterate, they highly demonstrated their class sentiments. They closely integrated with the members of the peasant association and the militia. Precisely because they were wearing two-and-a-half chi uniforms and carrying guns, in this border area (separated from the puppet and stubborn elements by only the Weihe River), they supported the masses, and the masses' courage was emboldened. They talked \"heart-to-heart\" with the masses, taught the militia to drill and sing, joined the masses in attacking special agents and guerrilla groups of the puppet and stubborn elements, and led the masses in carrying out the struggle to overthrow landlords. In just twenty-five days from June 12th to July 6th, they helped develop 303 peasant association members, organized 95 militiamen, mobilized 8 guns (for the militia), organized 245 children's corps members, organized women in two villages, reformed two peasant associations, and organized eleven struggles. ... In the struggle against the guerrilla groups of the puppet and stubborn elements, three people were captured, and the special agent activities of the puppet and stubborn elements were suppressed. Due to urgent tasks for the troops, the work team had to withdraw immediately. Before leaving, they said to the masses and village cadres: \"We are going back for a meeting.\" But the masses blocked the road to retain them, and the village cadres of Xiaopu Village locked the door to prevent them from leaving. The masses of the North Small District said: \"Comrades, help us to overthrow landlords to the end!\" In the end, they could not be retained and tearfully bid farewell. When the civil affairs group comrades returned to report on their work, they talked about the situation when they parted with the masses, and tears welled up in their eyes. Their unanimous opinion was that the time was too short and they had not helped the masses to completely overthrow landlords. From this, they saw that helping the masses to get rid of their suffering in the movement to overthrow landlords also greatly enlightened the army's class consciousness. Therefore, the people's army directly helping the masses to overthrow landlords is also a very effective method of troop education. The battalion has decided that once the task is completed, they will be sent back to mass work to help the masses completely overthrow landlords.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 响应刘伯承将军号召  卫河支队帮助群众翻身  临行群众热烈挽留挥泪告别\n\n1946-08-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　  响应刘伯承将军号召            \n    卫河支队帮助群众翻身       \n    临行群众热烈挽留挥泪告别\n    【本报荷泽讯】卫河支队一大队，响应刘伯承将军的号召，现正积极帮助群众翻身，实现耕者有其田。负责首长除命令全体指战员严格遵守群众纪律宣传与帮助群众外，更在大队中抽调下级干部及老解放区战士二十一人组成四个民运工作组，分赴道口、延津的六七区帮助群众翻身，以突破一点创造经验。开始时大家提出，“不识字”。“没经验”。“穿上二尺半不好接近群众”等困难，领导上说：“只要耐心的接近群众，依靠群众，为群众办事，这些困难都可克服的”。到了工作岗位以后，这些同志很快的就与群众打成一片了。工作组绝大部分同志是农民出身，虽然不识字，但高度的表现出阶级情绪，他们与农会会员、民兵密切地结合起来。正因为穿着二尺半拿着枪，在这个边沿区（与伪顽仅隔一条卫河）给群众撑腰，群众的胆子放大了。他们和群众谈“知心话”教民兵上操、唱歌和群众一起打击特务与伪顽的游击小组，领导群众进行翻身斗争。仅从六月十二到七月六日的二十五天当中，帮助发展农会会员三百零三人，组织民兵九十五人，动员枪八枝（给民兵），组织儿童团二百四十五人，组织两村妇女，改造农会两个，组织斗争十一次。………在与伪顽的游击小组斗争中，捕获了三人，伪顽的特务活动被压下去了。由于部队有紧急任务，工作队不得不马上撤回，临走时对群众与村干部说：“我们回去开会”但群众纷纷拦路挽留，小铺村干部把门锁起不让走，北小区群众说：“同志们帮我们翻身就帮到底呀”。最后挽留不住洒泪而别。民运组同志回去在汇报工作时，谈到与群众分别时的情形，眼泪夺眶而出，一致意见是时间太短了，没帮群众彻底翻身。从此看到了帮助群众解除痛苦的翻身运动当中，也大大启发了军队的阶级自觉，所以人民的军队直接去帮助群众翻身，也是一种极有效的部队教育方法。大队已决定一旦任务完成，还是让他们再回到群运中去，帮助群众彻底翻身。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: The British and Americans are at loggerheads over the Palestine issue. According to a United Press report on the 6th, the British government's plan to establish a Palestinian federation has been rejected by the United States. Truman said he was not favorably impressed with the British plan. On the same day, Reuters reported that Attlee was preparing to reject the U.S. proposal to move 100,000 Jews into Palestine. Reuters claimed that the federal plan and the immigration plan were inseparable. Since the United States rejected the British plan, Britain would naturally reject the American plan as well. An August 8th New York Times Washington correspondent reported, \"The British government has notified the United States that it will no longer allow illegal immigrants to Palestine. From now on, Britain will deport all illegal immigrants to the island of Cyprus.\" This note was issued after the British cabinet discussed the Palestine issue on the 7th. The British cabinet also decided: (1) Under no circumstances will it abandon its mandate over Palestine. (2) Even if the United States refuses to assist, Britain will complete the \"federal plan\" alone. According to the U.S. News Service, U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson, Secretary of the Army Patterson, and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder held a meeting on the 7th to discuss the British attitude. The meeting concluded on the 8th without a decision. It is understood that the British plan for a Palestinian federation was drafted in late July. The plan agreed to the U.S. suggestion to move 100,000 Jews into Palestine and advocated dividing Palestine into two autonomous states governed separately by Jews and Arabs, with two conditions attached: (1) The two autonomous states should be under British jurisdiction. (2) The United States should allocate $250 million to various Arab countries in the Middle East. According to British newspapers, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and the Anglo-American Committee of Experts on Palestine have agreed to the plan, but Truman changed his attitude due to opposition from some American financial capitalists.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: According to a combined report from the Associated Press, the British Navy and Air Force blockaded and intercepted 15,000 European Jewish immigrants on the 9th who were attempting to secretly enter Palestine. In order to deter the Jewish immigration movement, three British destroyers patrolled the coast of Palestine, while air force planes observed various ports on the Adriatic coast. It is believed that the intercepted Jews were sent to the island of Cyprus and temporarily placed in concentration camps.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 10th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Jerusalem, the Arab League stated that the Arabs did not agree with either the British federal plan or the American immigration plan. The League declared on the 9th, \"The Arabs have a very strong aversion to the United States' support for Jewish terrorism and open aggression against Palestine.\" It also stated that all but one of the Arab League countries opposed the plan to partition Palestine. The federal plan is a British plan to maintain its control over Palestine by dividing the Jewish and Arab populations, while the immigration plan is one of the expansion plans of American financial capital forces.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巴勒斯坦问题陷僵局  美方拒绝英国联邦计划英海空军阻止犹太移民  阿拉伯人反对英美侵略政策\n\n1946-08-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巴勒斯坦问题陷僵局  \n    美方拒绝英国联邦计划英海空军阻止犹太移民  \n    阿拉伯人反对英美侵略政策\n    【新华社延安十一日电】英美在巴勒斯坦问题上已闹僵。据合众社六日报导：英政府建立巴勒斯坦联邦的计划已遭美方拒绝，杜鲁门说他对英国这一计划印象颇为不佳。同日路透社报导：艾德礼正准备拒绝美方提议的将十万犹太人移入巴勒斯坦的计划。路透社称：联邦计划与移民计划是不可分割的，既然美国拒绝英方的计划，英国自然也将拒绝美国的计划。八日纽约时报华盛顿记者电称：“英政府业已通知美国，不允许再非法往巴勒斯坦移发难民，此后英国将把所有不合法的移民遣禁塞浦路斯岛。”此项照会，是英内阁七日讨论巴勒斯坦问题后发出的。英内阁并决定：（一）无论如何不放弃对巴勒斯坦的委任统治权。（二）甚至美国拒绝协助时，英国亦将单独完成“联邦计划”。据美新闻处讯：美代理国务卿亚泽逊、陆长柏德逊及财长斯尼德等于七日召开会议，讨论英国的态度，会议至八日告一段落，未作出决定。按英国的巴勒斯坦联邦计划，系于七月下旬拟出，该计划同意美国关于移十万犹太人入巴勒斯坦的建议，主张把巴勒斯坦分为犹太人与阿拉伯人分治的两个自治邦，惟附有两个条件，即：（一）此二自治邦应在英国管辖下。（二）由美国拨款二万五千万美元予中东各阿拉伯国家。据英报称：美国务卿贝纳斯与英美巴勒斯坦专家委员会已同意该计划，但由于一部分美国金融资本家的反对，杜鲁门乃改变态度。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】据合社众电：英国海空军封锁并于九日截获企图秘密进入巴勒斯坦的欧洲犹太移民一万五千人，为了阻遏犹太人的移民运动，英三艘驱逐舰巡逻巴勒斯坦海岸，空军飞机则观察亚得里亚海岸各港口。咸信被截获的犹太人，被送往塞浦路斯岛，暂置于集中营。\n    【新华社延安十日电】据路透社耶路撒冷讯：阿拉伯联盟表示：阿拉伯人既不同意英国的联邦计划，也不同意美国的移民计划。该联盟九日宣称：“阿拉伯对于美国的支持犹太恐怖主义及公开侵略巴勒斯坦具有极强烈的反感。”又称：阿拉伯联盟各国除一个以外，都反对分治巴勒斯坦的计划。按联邦计划为英国欲以分治回犹两族，保持其对巴勒斯坦控制的计划，移民计划为美国财政资本势力的扩张计划之一。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. Yesterday at 6 PM, over two thousand representatives from all walks of life in Yan'an held a memorial service for Mr. Tao Xingzhi at the Border Area Assembly Hall. The four walls of the hall were covered with inscriptions presented by various circles. The inscription by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, read \"Mourn the Great People's Educator.\" A female worker, Li Shuying, wrote, \"You live in the hearts of us workers.\" A group of elementary school students from Yan'an City wrote, \"We will each commemorate you by teaching two farmers well enough that they can recognize two hundred characters.\" The chief officiants were Lin Boqu, Xie Juezai, Lu Dingyi, and Xu Teli, with Li Zhuoran, Liu @, and eleven others as assistant officiants. Mr. Zhang Zonglin reported on Mr. Tao's life and deeds. Chairman Lin spoke on behalf of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, saying, \"Mr. Tao is a genius—a people's educator—produced in our disaster-ridden country in the last thirty years. This is the glory of the Chinese nation. His life and actions demonstrate his deep love for the broad masses of the people and his extreme hatred for fascist dictators. This is precisely the great spirit possessed by a generation of Chinese workers.\" Chairman Lin said, \"The people of the entire border region will permanently commemorate Mr. Tao Xingzhi. Although he never came here, his cause has been put into practice here and has increased the welfare of the broad masses. To commemorate Mr. Tao, the Border Region Government has decided to rename Yan'an Middle School as Xingzhi Middle School and establish the Xingzhi Scholarship, hoping that Mr. Tao's educational ideas will soon be implemented throughout the country.\" Subsequently, Lu Dingyi spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (the full text of the speech is in another dispatch). When invited to speak, Xu Teli pointed out that Mr. Tao's academic thought started from China's reality. He placed the transformation of society first. He was a great thinker and outstanding people's educator in modern China. Ding Huashan, representative of the Yan'an branch of the Society of Life Education, and Xu Hanru, representative of the Yucai School of the Shanghai Gongxuetuan, spoke successively. Xu Hanru said, \"Mr. Tao's death is a great sorrow for us children who have suffered hardships. In the Great Rear Area, it has made our classmates lose a protector of their body and mind. We must call on the youth of the liberated areas to come forward to support them and oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' destruction and sabotage of Mr. Tao's cause.\"\n    The meeting finally passed a resolution to organize the Tao Xingzhi Memorial Committee to handle research and other commemorative work. It is composed of ten people, including Lin Boqu, Xi Zhongxun, Xu Teli, Xie Juezai, Li Zhuoran, He Liancheng, Jiang Longji, Ke Zhongping, Ma Jichuan, and Zhang Zonglin. The meeting passed a telegram informing the national cultural and educational circles, Mr. Tao's family, and his friends of all the decisions regarding the memorial, as well as the situation of the memorial meeting.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, August 9th, Handan: The August 2nd incident of Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombing Yan'an has aroused extreme indignation among the military and civilians here. The reporter interviewed General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, on the morning of August 8th, who issued the following statement: This bombing of Yan'an by American-style Chiang Kai-shek planes is an extremely serious incident. Yan'an is the location of the CCP Central Committee and the CCP Military Headquarters, and it is far from the conflict zones. This signifies Chiang Kai-shek's determination to launch a full-scale civil war. This incident occurred simultaneously with the encirclement and annihilation of our Central Plains Military Region, the attacks on our Shandong and Northern Jiangsu liberated areas, and the attacks on the Jinnan liberated area in this region. This shows that Chiang Kai-shek, standing on Guling, has officially declared war on the people of the whole country who are fighting for independence, peace, and democracy. The military and civilians of our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region will never tolerate or stand idly by in the face of Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities. I call on the military and civilians of the entire region to rise up in self-defense.\n\nGeneral Liu continued to describe the situation of Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombing the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, stating: Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been continuously bombing peaceful towns in this region. According to incomplete statistics: Jinan City was bombed on July 30th, Wen County was bombed on August 1st, and various villages and towns in the suburbs of Yongnian were bombed continuously from July 11th to July 30th. The above bombings totaled more than 137 times (each time counted as one plane). In addition, harassment and strafing of Handan, Dongming, Houma, Wenxi, Meng County and other regions have not been included in the statistics. The people have suffered heavy losses, especially in Yongnian. Most of the houses of residents in the suburbs have been damaged, and the people have been displaced and have no means of living. It has been a year since Japan surrendered, but our country has still not achieved independence, democracy, and peace. Any patriotic and humane Chinese person, who would want to plunge the disaster-stricken China back into a colonial status and subject the people who fought in the eight-year war to this unexpected calamity? We issue a serious warning to Chiang Kai-shek, who is selling out the country's independence and relying on American imperialism, and call on the military and civilians of our entire region to immediately rise up, arm themselves for self-defense, and repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, defend Yan'an, and defend the liberated areas. We appeal to the people of the whole country: stop Chiang Kai-shek from using the air force in the civil war and stop Chiang Kai-shek's burning and killing of peaceful residents. General Liu finally pointed out that the reason why Chiang Kai-shek dares to launch a full-scale civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's planes dare to be so rampant is due to American assistance and so-called military aid to China. Chiang Kai-shek's planes, bombs, bullets, and gasoline are entirely supplied by the United States. The American reactionaries have ulterior motives to launch a civil war in China, but they still appear as mediators of the Chinese civil war. In fact, the United States has long lost its qualifications as a third-party mediator, and it is only the instigator and commander of the Chinese civil war. Therefore, we demand that the US government immediately stop military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and call on the American people to rise up and stop the US government's unreasonable interference in China's internal affairs.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 11th: Regarding the incident of Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombing the Yan'an headquarters on the 2nd, Lin Boqu and Li Dingming, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, issued statements to reporters. Chairman Lin Boqu said: \"The people of the border region have made great contributions in the eight-year war of resistance, faithfully implemented Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, the people live and work in peace and contentment, and are well-fed and clothed. The Kuomintang authorities, while using the banner of the Three Principles of the People, have been constantly harassing and attacking the liberated areas that truly implement the Three Principles of the People. This time, they even bombed the Yan'an headquarters. It is simply lawless! The Yan'an headquarters has lodged a solemn protest with the Kuomintang authorities, and it has been a week, but the Kuomintang authorities are still making unreasonable excuses and trying to shirk their guilt. Our border region people cannot but protest once again, and demand compensation and apologies, and severely punish the masterminds.\" Chairman Lin pointed out: \"The American planes and American bullets were used in this bombing of Yan'an. Therefore, we firmly oppose the current policy of the US government to help the Chinese reactionaries expand the civil war, and demand that the US government stop military aid to Chiang Kai-shek.\"\n\nVice-Chairman Li Dingming said: \"That day, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed Yan'an, dropping bombs 500 yards near the Wangjiaping headquarters. The people of Yan'an City saw it with their own eyes, but the Kuomintang spokesman still said that 'it did not pass over Yan'an City,' isn't that a lie!? It is clear that they strafed the old people who were weeding in the fields of Yinjiagou and destroyed the crops on the kiln side, but they still argued that 'the bombs were dropped on uninhabited barren mountains,' which is really ridiculous! In short, no matter how they deny it, this event is the prelude to Chiang Kai-shek launching a nationwide civil war.\" After recounting the facts of the Kuomintang reactionaries relying on the United States to carry out civil war and various humiliating acts of national betrayal, Vice-Chairman Li sighed: \"This is the tradition of Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty, 'Rather give it to foreign friends than to domestic slaves'!\" Vice-Chairman Li said: \"What crime have the people of the liberated areas committed? What crime has the Communist Party committed? Why attack them and bomb them? I am non-partisan and non-factional, and I want to say a few honest words from the standpoint of the people: The border region and various liberated areas, due to the implementation of the Three-thirds System, rent reduction and interest reduction, development of production, and various correct policies, have not received any assistance from the Kuomintang authorities in the eight-year war of resistance, but have victoriously resisted the Japanese invaders, and the people's lives are still very good. In recent years, although some areas have suffered natural disasters and difficulties, the Communist Party and the people have worked together to find ways to overcome them. Therefore, no one has starved to death in the border region and various liberated areas. If Chiang Kai-shek wants to continue to attack such a good government, he will inevitably be met with the unanimous resistance of the broad masses of the people.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抗议蒋机轰炸延安暴行  刘伯承将军发表谈话  林主席代表陕甘宁边区人民再度抗议\n\n1946-08-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　抗议蒋机轰炸延安暴行  \n    刘伯承将军发表谈话            \n    林主席代表陕甘宁边区人民再度抗议\n    【新华社八月九日邯郸电】八月二日蒋机空袭延安事件发生后，引起此间军民极度愤懑，记者为此事特于八月八日上午晋谒晋冀鲁豫军区刘伯承司令员，承发表谈话如次：此次美式蒋机轰炸延安，是一件极其严重的事件，延安是中共中央和中共军总部所在地，它距离冲突地点甚远，这标志着蒋介石发动全面大内战的决心。这事件又与围歼我中原军区进攻我山东及苏北解放区进攻本区之晋南解放区同时，这表明蒋介石站在牯岭之上已向全国独立和平民主奋斗的人民正式宣战了。我晋冀鲁豫军民对蒋介石此种暴行，决难容忍坐视，我号召全区军民起而自卫。\n    刘将军继述及蒋机对我晋冀鲁豫边区轰炸的情形称：近日来蒋机不断轰炸本区的和平城镇，据不完全统计：计有七月三十日轰炸济宁市，八月一日炸温县城，七月十一日至三十日连续炸永年城郊各村镇，以上轰炸次数在一百三十七次以上（每次以一架计）。此外对邯郸、东明、侯马、闻喜、孟县等地区骚扰与扫射，均未计算在内，人民损失惨重，尤以永年为最甚，城郊居民房屋大部损坏，人民流离失所，无以为生。日本投降已一周年，我国仍未能实现独立民主与和平，任何爱国的有人性的中国人，谁愿使灾难深重的中国重陷殖民地地位，而使八年抗战的人民受此飞来之横祸。我们特向出卖祖国独立依靠美帝国主义的蒋介石提出严重警告，并号召我全区军民立即起来，武装自卫，击退蒋介石的进攻，保卫延安保卫解放区。我们向全国人民呼吁：制止蒋介石使用空军于内战，停止蒋介石对和平居民的烧杀。刘将军最后指出蒋介石之所以敢于发动全面内战，蒋机敢于如此肆虐，是由于美国的帮助与所谓军事援华，蒋介石的飞机炸弹子弹和汽油完全是美国供应。美国反动派别具野心发动中国内战，但还以调解中国内战的姿态出现，其实美国第三者调解人的资格早已失掉，它只是中国内战的护纵指使者，因此我们要求美政府立即停止军事援蒋，呼吁美国人民起来制止美政府对于中国内政的无理干涉。\n    【新华社延安十一日电】对于蒋机二日轰炸延安总部事，陕甘宁边区政府林、李正副主席对记者发表谈话。林主席伯渠称：“边区人民在八年的抗战中，曾有伟大的贡献，忠实实行了中山先生的三民主义，人民安居乐业，衣丰食足，国民党当局打着三民主义的招牌，却对真正实行三民主义的各解放区不断骚扰进攻，这次竟然炸到延安总部来了，真是无法无天！延安总部为此曾向国民党当局提出严正抗议，迄今已一周，国民党当局还要无理狡辩，企图卸罪。我们边区人民不能不再一次提出抗议，并要求赔偿道歉，严厉惩办主谋者。”林主席指出：“这次轰炸延安用的是美国飞机，美国枪弹，因此我们对美国政府帮助中国反动派扩大内战的现行政策坚决反对，要求美国政府停止对蒋介石的军事援助。”\n    李副主席鼎铭称：“那天蒋介石飞机轰炸延安，投炸在王家坪总部附近五百码处，延市人民众目所睹，但国民党发言人还说‘没有经过延安市上空’，岂非撒谎！？明明扫射了正在尹家沟地里锄草的老百姓，毁灭了窑畔上的庄稼，还狡辩说‘炸弹投在无人烟的荒山’，实在可笑！总之，不管怎样抵赖，这件事是蒋介石发动全国规模内战的先声。”李副主席历述国民党反动派依靠美国进行内战及各种丧权辱国的事实之后，叹息道：“这就是满清末年慈禧太后‘宁赠友邦勿予家奴”的传统！”李副主席说：“解放区人民何罪？共产党何罪？为什么要进攻他们，轰炸他们？我是无党无派的，我想站在人民立场讲几句老实话：边区及各解放区由于执行了三三制、减租减息、发展生产及各种正确政策，在八年抗战中没有得到国民党当局的任何接济，但却胜利的抵御了日寇的进攻，人民生活还过得很好。几年来部分地区虽遭受天灾和困难，但共产党与人民一起共谋办法，把它战胜了，故在边区及各解放区没有人饿死，像这样的好政府，如果蒋介石再要继续进攻，则必然遭到广大人民一致抵抗。”"

    "title": "Head of Jiangsu-Anhui Construction Department Discusses Spring Repair and Summer Defense of the Grand Canal: We Completed the Spring Repair Project Despite Obstruction; Chiang's Troops Should Bear Full Responsibility If They Continue Sabotage",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-15",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 11th: Recently, the water level of the Grand Canal has risen. Our correspondent, concerned about the safety of life and property of the people in the 25 counties along the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu, interviewed the responsible authorities of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Construction Department to inquire about the situation of the Grand Canal's spring repairs and summer defenses. We are pleased to publish their remarks as follows:\n\nThe Grand Canal, which stretches 600 *li* within the Border Region, underwent spring repairs under extremely difficult circumstances this spring, amidst severe drought and without any external assistance. During this period, it suffered from the Kuomintang reactionaries' rumor-mongering, sabotage, aircraft strafing, and economic blockade, but was finally completed on June 8th. A total of nearly 40,000 people were mobilized, with expenses amounting to 80 million legal tender. A total of 247 damaged embankments were repaired, 21 soil and willow revetment projects were built, 7 sluice gates and dams were repaired, and in the central section, dredging and beach restoration projects were carried out, involving a total of 482,865 cubic meters of earthwork. Due to the completion of the above projects, the Grand Canal embankment, which had been wantonly destroyed by the enemy puppets and Kuomintang troops during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and was in a fragmented state, has been completely transformed and restored to its pre-war flood control capacity. By adopting the policy of \"work as relief,\" 150,000 disaster victims (including the families of the laborers) in 13 counties along the river were able to safely overcome the disaster. The excellence of the repair work has won praise from people from all walks of life both inside and outside the Border Region. Mr. Wu Xiangzai, a member of the Gaoyou County Council, said: \"The Grand Canal donation that the Kuomintang government used to collect should be handed over to the current democratic government for use, and even iron embankments could be built.\" UNRRA experts Yan Feide and Bi Shufu, and TRA Ningxia-Suiyuan Branch Director Yao Tuda, all unanimously praised the project, saying that contrary to outside rumors, they did not expect such a huge project to be constructed under such difficult conditions.\n\nRegarding summer defense projects, the Border Region Government has allocated a large amount of grain and funds to carry out repairs. On the other hand, the Kuomintang's loudly touted Grand Canal project has achieved nothing to date. In mid-March, when we were already organizing engineering, disposing of materials, and preparing to start construction, XXX shamelessly said at the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session: \"The government has long been prepared to repair the Grand Canal, but the area north of Shaobo is controlled by the Communist army, causing much obstruction, while the area south of Shaobo is a national army area, where progress can be made without problems.\" By the end of April, when our earthworks in various sections had been completed and the rock filling project had begun, the project planned by the Kuomintang authorities had not yet started. And the Kuomintang reactionaries spared no effort to sabotage our repair work. During the spring repair period, Chiang's troops opened fire on our laborers working south of Shaobo and used aircraft to strafe our laborers working in Baoying. Since July, they have been continuously bombing and strafing the Grand Canal embankments in various places. Recently, Chiang's troops in Shaobo have also been constantly harassing, making it impossible for us to carry out summer defense work in the Shaobo area. The Kuomintang propaganda machine has been fabricating rumors and distorting the facts in every possible way. The Ta Kung Pao reported on June 21st: \"The water level of the Grand Canal has been rising continuously in recent days, making it impossible to carry out repairs in the entire area. Whether northern Jiangsu can avoid the catastrophe of the inundation of the 20th year of the Republic of China can only be left to fate.\" This was a deliberate attempt to obliterate our spring repair work. A few days ago, Chiang's planes even dropped leaflets over Gaoyou, claiming: \"The Communist army is destroying the Grand Canal embankment, causing flooding in the surrounding areas.\" They are trying to frame us and cover up their consistent sabotage conspiracy. If the repair project completed by our Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government after all kinds of hardships is hindered by the sabotage of Chiang's aircraft and troops, causing difficulties in summer defense and endangering the Grand Canal embankment, causing suffering to millions of people in northern Jiangsu, then the Kuomintang authorities should bear full responsibility.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖建设厅负责人  谈运河春修夏防情形  我备经阻扰完成春修工程蒋军倘仍破坏则应负全责\n\n1946-08-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖建设厅负责人            \n    谈运河春修夏防情形           \n    我备经阻扰完成春修工程蒋军倘仍破坏则应负全责\n    【新华社淮阴十一日电】近日运河水涨，本社记者以运河有关江北二十五县人民生命财产安全，特走访苏皖边区建设厅负责当局询问运河春修夏防情形。承发表谈话如次：\n    边区境内全长六百里的运河，春修工程系在今春严重灾荒绝无外援的困苦情况下进行。其间备受国民党反动派造谣破坏飞机扫射及经济封锁之阻扰，但终于六月八日全部完成。计动员群众近四万人，用费合法币八万万元。共修复残破堤岸二百四十七处，修筑埽土护岸工程二十一处，修治闸坝七处，中段并进行拆坝修滩工程共计用土四十八万二千八百六十五公方。由于以上工程的完成，已使八年抗战中为敌伪及国民党部队姿意毁坏，陷于支离破碎的运河堤顿然改观，恢复到抗战前的防水强度。由于采取了以工代赈的方针，并使沿河十三县十五万灾民（连民夫家属在内）得以安渡灾荒。运修工程的精坚，博得边区内外各界人士的赞誉。高邮县参议员吴襄哉先生说：“要把过去国民党政府办的运河捐，交给现在民主政府使用，修铁堤也修起来了。”联总专家严斐德、毕叔甫，行总苏宁分署遥屠达诸先生，都一致赞许，认为与外间传闻相反，想不到在这种艰苦条件下能建设这样巨大的工程。\n    关于夏防工程，边府已拨出大量粮款从事兴修。反观国民党方面，大肆叫嚣的运河工程迄今毫无所成。三月中旬，当我们已在组织工程处置办材料筹备兴工时，×××就在国民党二中全会上大言不惭的说：“修治运河，政府早已准备，但邵伯以北为共军所控制阻扰颇多，邵伯以南为国军地区进行可无问题。”到四月底，当我们各段土工均已完成开始填石工程时，国民党当局计划的工程还没有动手。而国民党反动派对我修复工作之破坏，则不遗余力。当今春兴修时期，蒋军对我在邵伯以南做工的民夫开枪射击，并用飞机对我宝应做工的民夫扫射。七月以来更对各地运河堤岸作连续性的轰炸扫射。近来邵伯蒋军亦不断出扰，使我们在邵伯一带夏防工作无法进行。国民党宣传机关反百般造谣颠倒黑白，六月二十一日大公报载：“运河连日水涨，全区无法兴修，苏北能否避免民二十年之陆沉浩劫唯有听诸一命。”有意将我春修工作一笔抹煞。日前蒋机更到高邮上空散发传单宣称：“共军破坏运堤，沿河一带受淹。”妄图嫁祸于我，借以掩盖其一贯破坏阴谋。我苏皖边区政府经历千辛万苦完成之运修工程，倘因蒋机蒋军之破坏阻扰，使夏防困难而致运堤发生危险，使苏北千百万人民受难，则国民党当局应负其全责。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 12th: Marshall and Stuart issued a joint statement on the 10th, stating: \"Regarding the economic situation, if a complete collapse is to be avoided, immediate solutions must be sought.\" After this statement was released, Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda for the Kuomintang, immediately issued a statement in Shanghai, saying: \"Recently, our country's financial and economic situation has gradually improved,\" \"This year, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan provinces have all reported bumper harvests, and grain and commodity prices have fallen.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency reporter commented: The Kuomintang authorities, who persist in the civil war, are facing the \"complete collapse\" of the \"economic situation.\" This truth has even been acknowledged by Marshall and Stuart. The \"complete collapse\" facing the \"economic situation\" is an important factor in the inevitable and disastrous defeat of the Kuomintang authorities' policy of civil war. Peng Xuepei's statement is intended to conceal the fatal wound on the warmongers, but the facts cannot be concealed. This year's summer harvest in Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces yielded only 30% of the normal unit area output. In Hunan, \"even the planted land is suffering because the disaster victims are not well-fed and have no strength to water, weed, or fertilize, leaving it to grow by relying on the heavens. Therefore, the actual income will be difficult to reach 60%.\" (Reported by a special correspondent of the Ta Kung Pao in mid-July). According to exaggerated statistics from the Sichuan Agricultural Improvement Institute, the early-season harvest in Sichuan was only around 50% of the normal yield for various crops, and the actual situation was even more serious than the above figures. Large areas of cultivated land in various provinces have been abandoned. According to newspaper reports, 65% of the cultivated land in Jiangxi province was abandoned in the first half of this year, more than one-third in Hunan, one-third in Anhui, one-quarter in Henan, 60% in northern Hubei, one-quarter in southern Hubei (Liupu area), and more than three-quarters in northern Guangxi. In Guangdong, Gaoyao in Xijiang is the worst, with abandoned land reaching 60%. Therefore, the total agricultural output of each province this season is much smaller than the harvest ratio. The \"decline in grain prices\" mentioned by Peng is only a phenomenon in some areas, and the decline is minimal. Moreover, every year when the harvest season arrives, grain prices temporarily fall, and bureaucratic capital buys up agricultural products at low prices, but in an instant, grain prices soar again, and the peasants have no grain left. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek government is vigorously implementing requisitioning and borrowing of grain, as well as allocating military grain, which will further promote severe famine. As of July, incidents of starving people抢米(qiang mi - to rob rice) had occurred successively in Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces, and people's uprisings were rampant in northern Sichuan. The true situation of the rural \"bumper harvest\" mentioned by Peng Xuepei is like this.\n\nRegarding the financial situation of the Kuomintang government, the average monthly expenditure for the first five months of this year exceeded 50 million yuan, and the average monthly expenditure for the next seven months reached 100 million yuan. As the civil war continues to expand, the deficit will become larger. Only by printing more banknotes can more malignant inflation be caused (the current amount of paper money issued has exceeded 1,500 times the pre-war level), making it even more impossible for people of all classes to live, and even government employees are starving. Their strikes have spread to thirteen provinces. In the Anhui provincial government, only \"Chairman\" Li Pinxian did not participate in the strike of government employees.\n\nThe result of the Kuomintang's dictatorial and civil war policy is that, apart from a small group of big bureaucratic compradors and secret service chiefs, everyone else is threatened with starvation. To save the Kuomintang-controlled area from the danger of complete economic collapse, the people of the whole country must work together to smash the Chiang Kai-shek government's policy of civil war and dictatorship.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋政府坚持独裁内战  经济面临完全崩溃  彭学沛发表谈话妄图掩饰\n\n1946-08-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋政府坚持独裁内战  \n    经济面临完全崩溃            \n    彭学沛发表谈话妄图掩饰\n    【新华社延安十二日电】马歇尔、司徒雷登十日下午联合声明称：“就经济情势方面，如欲避免完全崩溃，须立谋立即之解决。”这声明发表后，国民党中宣部长彭学沛立即在沪发表谈话谓：“最近我国之财政经济情况已渐入佳境”，“今年江西、四川、湖南、各省均称丰收，粮价物价下跌”。\n    新华社记者评称：坚持内战的国民党当局，面临着“经济情况”的“完全崩溃”，这一真理连马歇尔和司徒雷登也不得不承认。“经济情况”之面临“完全崩溃”，是国民党当局内战政策必然惨败之一个重要因素。彭学沛的谈话就是为掩饰好战派身上的致命伤，但是事实是掩饰不了的。今年夏收，河南、广东、广西等省的单位面积产量均不及常年的三成，湖南“即使已播种的地，也因灾民食不饱无力浇水锄草施肥，任其靠天滋长，故实际收入甚难达六成。”（七月中大公报特派员报导）四川早季收成，即据四川农业改进所的夸大统计，各项作物的收成也不过常年的百分之五十上下，而且实际情形比上述数字还要严重的多。各省耕地已有大量抛荒，据报章披露，江西全省今年上半年耕地抛荒百分之六十五，湖南三分之一以上，安徽三分之一，河南四分之一，鄂北百分之六十，鄂南（柳蒲折）四分之一，广西北部四分之三以上，广东以西江高要为最，荒地达百分之六十。因此各省今年一季农产总量比较收成比例还要小得很多。彭氏所说的“粮价下跌”只是部分地区的现象，跌数也极微，而且每年时届收成，粮价一时下跌，官僚资本以低价收括农产，但一转瞬间粮价又飞涨，而农民已粒米无存。加以蒋介石政府正厉行征实征借及摊派军粮，更将促进了严重的饥荒。迄七月份止，饥民抢米事件在湖南、广东、广西、福建、浙江、江苏等省相继发生，四川北部民变蜂起。彭学沛所说的农村“丰收”其真情就是如此。\n    关于国民党政府的财政状况，今年头五月的开支平均每个月超过五千万万元，后七个月的每月平均支出数达一万万万元，内战继续扩大，则赤字越大，只有印发更多的钞票造成更恶性的通货膨涨（现在纸币发行数额已超过抗战前一千五百倍），使各阶层人民更加无法生活，连政府公务员也都饿肚子。他们的罢工已遍及十三省，安徽省政府公务员罢工，没有参加的只剩“主席”李品仙一个人。\n    国民党的独裁内战政策的结果，就是除了一小群大官僚买办和特务头子以外，其余的人都要遭受饿死的威胁。要挽救国民党统治区经济完全崩溃的危险，只有全国人民一致努力，粉碎蒋介石政府的内战独裁政策。"

After the two companies revolted, they were fiercely pursued by Chiang's army, and have now safely arrived in our liberated area. Our local residents immediately gave them a warm welcome, and the officers and soldiers of the uprising were extremely excited.\n    [This newspaper’s dispatch from Changzhi on the 12th] In the northern Henan area, Chiang's army is actively deploying for a large-scale civil war, and the stubborn troops are being transferred frequently. The 177th Brigade of the 38th Division was transferred to Huixian in early July, and the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division, originally stationed in Huixian, was transferred to Xiuwu and Wuzhi, to attack us. On the 13th of last month, the Northern Henan Security Third Column, originally stationed in Jixian, moved between Qixian and Tangyin, and the 110th Brigade of the 85th Division was transferred to Qixian. Around the strongholds of Chiang's army in Huixian and other places, the people are forced to cut down all tall crops, otherwise they will be accused of \"colluding with bandits,\" and even sesame is included in the cutting list. Chiang's army in various places is actively seizing grain and conscripting men to replenish the troops.\n    [This newspaper’s dispatch from Jiaozuo on the 10th] Chiang Kai-shek recently used a \"beheading policy\" to further annex miscellaneous troops, transferring the original officers of miscellaneous troops to other places and replacing them with Whampoa clique officers, attempting to use this to divide miscellaneous troops and carry out civil war. According to reliable sources, Chiang Kai-shek recently sent sixty Whampoa clique officers to the 17th Division of the current 38th Army. A considerable number of Whampoa clique officers have also been sent to other troops. The officers and soldiers of various non-direct-line troops are extremely dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's insidious and vicious plan. Wu Jingye, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the 51st Regiment of the 17th Division, recently led more than ten soldiers to withdraw from the civil war and safely arrived in the liberated area of northern Henan.\n    [This newspaper’s dispatch from Heze on the 11th] With the assistance of American imperialist elements, Chiang's army is actively destroying the liberated areas of northern Huaihai and eastern Henan south of the Longhai Railway, attempting to destroy the Jilu豫 [冀鲁豫, short for Hebei-Shandong-Henan] area north of the railway. The entire conspiracy is being carried out step by step. Along the 480-li line between Kaifeng and Xuzhou, the masses are forced to build bunkers and dig blockade ditches, and are ordered to completely remove all tall crops within 400 chi [a unit of length] north and south of the line, destroying a total of 780 square li [a unit of area] of farmland. Since the beginning of August, they have been attacking our Eighth Sub-district of northern Huaihai from the east and west, attempting to compress our army to the area between Xiayi, Yongcheng, and Haoxian and encircle and annihilate us. A division of Cao Fulin's troops of the 55th Army and the puppet Zhang Lanfeng's troops are currently deployed on the line between Shangqiu and Haoxian, gradually advancing eastward. On the Xuzhou side, Chiang's army is using Xiaoxian as a stronghold to exert pressure westward, and the situation is extremely tense. Chiang's army is sending planes to bomb our cities such as Jining and peaceful residents, and is carrying out starvation tactics against our border areas. All of this proves that Chiang Kai-shek's attack on our liberated areas of northern Huaihai and eastern Henan is actually intended to repeat another encirclement and annihilation plan in the Central Plains. Now, the military and civilians of our entire region are resolutely rising up in self-defense, giving the invaders a devastating blow.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北形势万分紧张中  蒋军两连反内战起义  蒋军进攻淮北豫东解放区我全区军民坚决奋起自卫\n\n1946-08-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北形势万分紧张中  \n    蒋军两连反内战起义            \n    蒋军进攻淮北豫东解放区我全区军民坚决奋起自卫\n    【本报焦作十一日电】于白崇禧再度抵新（乡）部署内战，豫北形势万分紧急情况下，驻辉县之蒋军三十八师一百一十七旅五百三十团第一营第二、三两连不甘充作内战炮灰，遂于八日晚光荣起义。该两连起义后，曾经蒋军猛烈追击，现已安全抵达我解放区，我当地居民立即予以热烈之欢迎，起义官兵倍加兴奋。\n    【本报长治十二日电】豫北方面，蒋军正积极部署大规模内战，顽军调动频繁，三八师一七七旅七月上旬调来辉县，原驻辉之三二师一四一旅调修武、武陟，向我进攻。上月十三日原驻汲县之豫北保安三纵队开淇县、汤阴间，八五师一一零旅调往淇县。辉县等地蒋军据点周围，均强迫人民将高杆作物一律割倒，否则以“通匪”论罪，甚至芝麻亦在被割之列，各地蒋军均积极抢粮抓丁，补充部队。\n    【本报焦作十日电】蒋介石近以“杀头政策”，进一步吞灭杂牌部队，将杂牌部队原来军官他调，以黄浦系军官接替，妄图以此分化杂牌进行内战。据可靠消息，蒋介石最近以黄浦系军官六十人派往现三十八军之十七师。其他各部队亦派有相当数量之黄浦系军官。各非嫡系部队官兵对蒋介石此种阴恶毒辣计划，极表不满。十七师五十一团二营营长吴敬业日前率十余士兵退出内战，安抵豫北解放区。\n    【本报荷泽十一日电】蒋军在美帝国主义分子援助下，积极摧残我陇海路南之淮北，豫东解放区，企图淮而摧毁路北之冀鲁豫，全部阴谋正在逐步进行。在开封徐州间长达四百八十里，沿线强迫群众修筑碉堡，挖封锁沟，命令群众全部除去沿线南北四百尺以内之高庄稼，毁弃田禾面积达七百八十平方华里之多。自八月初起，东西夹击我淮北八分区，企图将我军压缩至夏邑、永城、毫县间一带围歼。五十五军曹福林所部一个师及伪张岚峰部，刻已部署于商邱、毫县之线，逐渐向东推进。徐州方面，蒋军则以萧县为据点向西压迫，情势异常紧张。蒋军一面派飞机轰炸我济宁等城和平居民，一面对我边沿区进行断食，凡此种种证明蒋介石对我淮北、豫东解放区之进攻，实欲重演再一次的中原围歼计划。现我全区军民坚决奋起自卫，给进犯者以歼灭的打击。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 11th: Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops launched a large-scale offensive against Jiangsu and Anhui, Chiang Kai-shek's planes, taking advantage of the river's high water level, have continuously bombed and destroyed the dikes of the Yun and Shu Rivers within the Jiangsu and Anhui liberated areas. On the 29th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed the Shu River dike in Xin'an Town. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek's planes dropped several bombs on the Yun dike outside Gaoyou. On the 30th, several bombs were dropped on the Yun dike at Wangjiatun, nine miles north of Gaoyou City, one of which landed directly on the top of the dike, damaging a section. Wangying and other places along the canal north of Gaoyou were repeatedly strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, hindering and damaging the summer flood prevention projects. As early as the beginning of June, the Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou had illegally blocked the Lanjiang dams, which divert floodwaters from the canal into the Yangtze River, causing floods in Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua and other counties. The Border Region Provisional Assembly telegraphed Mr. Song Ziwen, requesting him to forward the message to the Kuomintang Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to open the dams, but received no reply. Recently, the Air Force has continued the destruction. At the same time, the Kuomintang propaganda machine has continuously spread rumors such as \"Communist troops are destroying the dikes of the Yun and Shu Rivers in northern Jiangsu\" and \"Communist troops are destroying the Hongze Lake dam.\" People here believe that this is a vicious conspiracy by the Kuomintang reactionaries to flood the 21 million people in northern Jiangsu to assist their insufficient military offensive and at the same time shift the blame onto others. In response to this, in addition to expressing strong protests, various places are establishing dike protection organizations to assist in the smooth progress of summer flood prevention projects.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 31st: The Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government has recently allocated 19 million Central China currency (equivalent to 120 million legal tender) to repair the middle and southern sections of the Yun River's summer flood prevention project in order to protect the lives and property of millions of people along the river.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 12th: Comrade Lu Dingyi, representing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech at the memorial service for Mr. Tao Xingzhi as follows:\n\n　　Today, I represent the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to mourn Mr. Tao Xingzhi. The CPC Central Committee is extremely saddened by the death of Mr. Tao Xingzhi, considering it a major loss to the Chinese independence, peace, and democracy movement, and a major loss to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. This is because Mr. Tao dedicated his life to the cause of national salvation, democracy, and education, and his contribution to the people in education is particularly enormous and indelible. Mr. Tao's death is an irreplaceable loss to the Chinese democratic and educational movements.\n\n　　The Mr. Tao Xingzhi we mourn was an educator of the people. There can be two different purposes for conducting education among the people. One is to deceive the people, to make them willingly be slaves of reactionaries, docile subjects of imperialism, to obey fate or the dictates of heroes. Education for this purpose, no matter what it is called, is definitely not education for the people, but only education for slaves. This kind of education is definitely without a future, because if the Chinese people are not liberated from the oppression of imperialism and feudal forces, the cause of education will have no prospect of development, only a prospect of decline.\n\n　　Mr. Tao Xingzhi's educational theory and practice have another purpose, which is to awaken the people to liberate themselves. He regarded the people as human beings, not as slaves or docile subjects. He advocated the liberation of the people, and he believed in the power and wisdom of the people, so he believed that the people could liberate themselves. In education, he also believed in the power and wisdom of the people. This idea is full of his writings. He advocated that education run by the people for themselves is the ideal education. He worked tirelessly for this proposition all his life. Anyone who has seen Mr. Tao has been moved by his spirit of hard work and perseverance. Mr. Tao's educational thought is precisely a democratic educational thought, precisely an educational thought serving the people. Education aimed at awakening the people to liberate themselves has extremely broad prospects for development. This kind of education suffered all kinds of oppression and disasters under the rule of the Kuomintang and could not achieve broad development. This is because China under the rule of the Kuomintang was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, a China ruled by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Mr. Tao and his career suffered hardships there, and these hardships were a microcosm of the suffering of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. But this kind of hardship will be temporary. In the liberated areas of China where the people have been liberated, Mr. Tao's ideas are widely welcomed, and his ideals are realized and carried forward. This will certainly be the case in the future New Democratic China. Therefore, education that awakens the people to liberate themselves is education that serves the people, education that belongs to the people themselves, and has a bright and broad prospect for development.\n\n　　To serve the cause of education for the Chinese people, educators cannot but ask about politics, and must firmly stand on the side of the people in politics and carry out a strong struggle. This is because the mountains of imperialism and feudal forces are heavily pressing down on the Chinese people, and the cause of education for the people is also oppressed by these reactionary forces and cannot develop. Since Mr. Tao participated in the National Salvation Association after the September 18th Incident, his political stance has been very clear. In politics, he became a close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese Communist Party in the democratic movement. It was not accidental that Mr. Tao was like this. He deeply understood from his many years of practical experience that the Chinese Communist Party is the backbone of the Chinese democratic movement, understood the CPC's selflessness, the correctness of the CPC's propositions, and the CPC's steadfastness in fighting for the interests of the people and the nation, so he disregarded all slanders and oppressions and joined hands with the Communist Party to fight. In his political life, Mr. Tao Xingzhi's propositions, actions, style, close ties with the people, hard work, perseverance, and willingness to sacrifice his life are all models for the people. Not only should others take them as models to learn from, but our two million Chinese Communist Party members should also take them as models to learn from. The path taken by Mr. Tao is correct, and it is the same path taken by great nationalists such as Mr. Lu Xun and Mr. Zou Taofen.\n\n　　Now Mr. Tao has unfortunately died. His death was due to overwork in the struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. Before his death, Kuomintang secret agents assassinated Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo and other gentlemen, and prepared a blacklist to assassinate many democrats in Shanghai. Kuomintang secret agents went to Mr. Tao's residence to inquire about Mr. Tao's whereabouts, apparently wanting to harm him. Mr. Tao knew he was in danger and spent a night sorting out 100,000 words of poetry so that he could fight the enemy without any worries. This shows Mr. Tao's great spirit of sacrificing his life for the liberation of the people. However, due to excessive labor, he suddenly suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died the next day.\n\n　　We, the Chinese Communists and the educational circles in the liberated areas, must inherit Mr. Tao's legacy and fight. We must unite closely under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong to strive for independence, peace, and democracy, and strive for the realization of a New Democratic China! We in the educational circles in the liberated areas must study Comrade Mao Zedong's and Mr. Tao Xingzhi's New Democratic educational principles and implement them. Awaken the people in the liberated areas to participate more actively in the construction of the liberated areas and the war of self-defense.\n\n　　Mr. Tao Xingzhi's spirit is immortal!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陆定一同志大会演辞\n\n1946-08-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陆定一同志大会演辞\n    【新华社延安十二日电】陆定一同志代表中共中央于追悼陶行知先生会上演辞如下：\n    我今天代表中国共产党中央委员会来追悼陶行知先生，中共中央对于陶行知先生之死异常悲痛，认为这是中国独立和平民主运动的重大损失，是中国人民解放事业的重大损失，因为陶先生一生致力于救国事业民主事业与教育事业，他在教育方面对人民的贡献尤为巨大与不可磨灭。陶先生之死，对于中国民主运动与教育运动是不可补偿的损失。\n    我们追悼的陶行知先生，是人民的教育家。在人民中进行教育，可以有两种不同的目的，一种是蒙蔽人民，要人民甘心做反动派的奴隶，做帝国主义的顺民，服从命运或英雄的摆布，为着这种目的的教育，不管它叫什么名字，决不是为人民教育，而只能是奴隶的教育。这种教育是决计没有前途的，因为如果中国人民不从帝国主义和封建势力的压迫之下解放出来，教育事业就没有发展的前途，只有衰落的前途。\n    陶行知先生的教育理论与教育实践是有另外一种目的，这个目的就是唤起人民自己解放自己，他把人民看作人，而不是看作奴隶与顺民。他主张人民的解放，他又相信人民的力量，人民的智慧，所以他相信人民能够自己解放自己。在教育事业上，他同样相信人民的力量，人民的智慧，这种思想充满在他的著作之中，他主张人民自己为自己办的教育才是理想的教育。他为了这个主张孜孜不倦干了一生，谁见过陶先生的就被他的艰苦卓绝的精神所感动。陶先生的这种教育思想，正是为民主主义的教育思想，正是为人民服务的教育思想。以焕起人民自己解放自己为目的的教育，是有极其宽广的发展前途的。这种教育，在国民党统治之下受尽了压迫，受尽了灾难，不能得到宽广的发展，这是因为在国民党统治之下的中国乃是半殖民地、半封建的中国，乃是帝国主义和国民党反动派所统治着的中国。陶先生和他的事业，在那里受到磨难，这种磨难乃是中华民族中国人民所受到的苦难的缩影。但是这种磨难将是暂时的，在人民已经得到解放的中国解放区，陶先生的思想得到广大的欢迎，他的理想被实现，被发扬广大，在将来的新民主主义的中国也一定如此，所以唤起人民自己解放自己的教育才是为人民服务的教育，才是人民自己的教育，才有光明的宽广的发展前途。\n    要为中国人民的教育事业服务，教育家不能不问政治的，而且不能不在政治上坚决站在人民的方面作坚强的奋斗。这是因为帝国主义与封建势力这座大山重重的压在中国人民的身上，为人民的教育事业也被这些反动势力压得不能发展。陶先生从九一八后参加救国会起，他的政治立场就很鲜明了，在政治上他与中国共产党成为民主运动中的亲密战友。陶先生所以如此并不是偶然的，他是从他的多年实际经验中深切了解了中国共产党是中国民主运动的中坚，了解了共产党的大公无私，共产党的主张正确，共产党在为人民和民族的利益奋斗时坚强不屈，所以不顾一切诬蔑压迫，与共产党携手奋斗。陶行和先生在他的政治生活中，他的主张、他的行动、他的作风、他的与人民的密切联系、他的刻苦耐劳坚强不屈视死如归，都是人民的模范。不仅仅别人应该把它们当作模范来学习，我们二百万中国共产党员也要把它们当作模范来学习。陶先生所走的道路是正确的，这正是伟大的民族主义者，像鲁迅先生、邹韬奋先生等走的同样的道路。\n    现在陶先生不幸死了，他的死是在为独立为和平为民主的奋斗中劳苦过度而死的。死的以前，国民党特务暗杀了李公朴闻一多等先生，并且准备了黑名单要暗杀上海许多民主人士，国民党特务曾到陶先生寓所打听陶先生的行踪，显然是想加害于他。陶先生自知身处险境，一夜整理诗稿十万字，以便可以无所牵挂与敌人战斗，这里表现了陶先生为了人民解放视死如归的伟大精神，可是因为过分劳苦，次日即突患脑出血逝世。\n    我们中国共产党人和解放区的教育界要继承陶先生的遗志奋斗，我们要在毛泽东同志为首的中共中央领导之下团结得紧紧的，来争取独立和平民主，争取新民主主义新中国的实现！我们解放区的教育界，要研究毛泽东同志和陶行知先生的新民主主义的教育原理，并把他实现。唤起解放区的人民，更加积极的参加解放区的建设工作和自卫战争。\n    陶行知先生精神不死！"

During the Zhaoyangji self-defense battle in Yugou at the end of last month, thousands of local militia and masses bravely rushed to the front lines to assist in combat and rescue the wounded. Town Chief Ding of Gaozuo Town personally led his team, closely following the combat troops, braving artillery fire and aerial strafing. When the Chiang army was routed, they charged forward with a burst of energy, rescuing the wounded while shouting alongside the soldiers to the Chiang soldiers, \"Lay down your guns!\" \"The New Fourth Army treats prisoners well!\" Immediately, over a hundred Chiang soldiers laid down their arms. Zhang Chiyuan, a villager from Shanghu Township, forced Chiang soldiers to surrender two rifles with just a carrying pole. The Yao圩 Township stretcher team refused to sleep properly for six days and five nights. Team member Zhou Xuxiang said, \"Comrades are risking their lives to defend our hometown; what does a little suffering count for?\" They transported the spoils of war to the rear without stopping until the task was completely finished.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 12th. People in Linyu and other areas along the Great Wall, unable to endure the ravages of Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets, have risen up in self-defense. On the 1st of last month, when Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from Shangzhuangtu invaded Caoyingzhen and Yiyuan Pass, they looted and raped along the way but were repelled by the joint village blocking war launched by nearby militia. On the 2nd and 3rd, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from the area were dispatched again, attempting to retaliate, but were again defeated by the militia. On the 1st, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from Shimenzhai and Dagu, taking advantage of the Caoyingzhen market day, suddenly launched a surprise attack. Upon hearing the news, the militia of nearby villages surrounded the surrounding mountains and repelled them with dense firepower. Enraged by the invasion, the puppet troops from Shangzhuang and Shimenzhai in Shanhaiguan gathered again on the 13th to occupy Caoyingdi. Hundreds of local militia, in coordination with local armed forces, risked an ambush, and people's self-defense teams from dozens of miles around came one after another to deliver food, carry stretchers, and support the battle. After three hours of fighting, the puppet troops collapsed and fled along their original route, leaving more than 30 bodies behind. Since last autumn, with American help, Chiang Kai-shek's troops successively occupied Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Shimenzhai, Shanhaiguan and other places originally liberated by the Eighth Route Army, and then appointed the 3rd Regiment of the military puppet army security column to garrison and continue to poison the people. According to incomplete statistics from March to June this year: Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops plundered more than 360,000 stones of grain from the masses, extorted more than 290 million yuan, and arrested and killed more than 100 people, including Zhou Yuan, the head of one district.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 丁镇长率民兵火线喊话  蒋军百余放下武器  临榆一带民兵连续打退蒋伪进攻\n\n1946-08-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　丁镇长率民兵火线喊话\n    蒋军百余放下武器         \n    临榆一带民兵连续打退蒋伪进攻\n    【新华社淮阴十三日电】上月底渔沟朝阳集自卫战役中，当地数千民兵及群众英勇地奔赴前线协助作战和抢救伤员。高作镇丁镇长亲率队员紧随着战斗部队行进，于炮火和飞机扫射落下，当蒋军溃败时，一鼓劲冲上前去，一面抢救伤员，一面和战士们同声向蒋军高呼“缴枪呀”！“新四军优待俘虏”！立刻有蒋军百余名放下武器。商湖乡乡民张柴远，凭一条扁担迫令蒋军缴出了两枝步枪。姚圩乡担架队六天五夜不肯好好睡眠，队员周须祥说：“同志们拿性命保卫俺们的家乡，俺吃一点苦算什么呢？”他们往来不停地运送战利品到后方，直到任务全部完成为止。\n    【新华社遵化十二日电】沿长城一带临榆等地人民，不堪蒋伪蹂躏，奋起自卫。上月一日，上庄坨蒋伪军进犯操营镇、义院口时，沿途大肆抢掠奸淫，被附近民兵开展联村堵击战击退。二、三两日，该地蒋伪军又出动三百余人，企图进行报复，又遭民兵击溃。一日石门寨、大股蒋伪军，乘操营镇大集，突又进行奔袭，附近各村民兵闻讯，团团占据周围山头，以密军火力将其击退。侵犯者愤恼之余，又于十三日集结山海关上庄、石门寨等地伪军，攻占操营地，当地数百民兵乃配合地方武装冒险向该伪围击，数十里内的人民自卫队亦纷纷结队赶来送饭、抬担架、支援作战，战斗三小时许，伪军不支，向原路逃窜，遗尸三十余具。溯自去秋蒋军在美方帮助下，相继攻占原为八路军解放了秦皇岛、北戴河、石门寨、山海关等地后，即委用军伪军保安纵队第三团驻守，继续荼毒人民。据今年三月至六月不完全统计：蒋伪军掠夺群众粮食三十六万余石，勒索款项二万万九千余万元，捕杀一区区长周辕等百余人。"

    "content": "Seven-Month Summary – On the Joint Statement of Marshall and Stuart, Editorial of Liberation Daily\n    On the tenth of this month, Marshall and Stuart issued a joint statement, which, as Reuters reporters said, was Marshall \"admitting that his efforts to promote peace and unity in China have practically failed.\" Since Marshall arrived in China in late December last year, at the request of the Moscow Three-Power Conference resolutions, he personally helped China conclude four major agreements: the January 10th Truce Agreement, the January Political Consultative Conference's five agreements, the February 25th Military Reorganization Plan, and the March 27th Northeast Truce Agreement. Now, seven and a half months after his arrival in China, he himself announced that the fundamental issues of the Kuomintang-Communist dispute \"seem unlikely to be resolved.\" In fact, Marshall's efforts have not only failed today, but today's civil war is larger in scale and more brutal in nature than it was seven and a half months ago. Before Marshall arrived, Chiang Kai-shek used one million soldiers to fight the civil war, accounting for about 45 percent of his total military strength; now this force has increased to nearly 200 divisions, about two million people, accounting for about 85 percent of Chiang Kai-shek's total military strength. Before Marshall arrived, Chiang Kai-shek's army had 39 divisions equipped with American weapons; now there are 57 divisions, all of which are used on the front lines. In addition, there are air forces formed by American planes and navies formed by American ships. The current civil war is simply a cruel satire on the so-called \"mediation\" and \"aid to China\"!\n    The Marshall-Stuart joint statement emphasizes the difficulty of reaching an agreement. Is it really that difficult to reach an agreement? Why were four extremely important agreements reached from January to March! These agreements were achieved because, on the one hand, the vast majority of the Chinese people wanted independence, peace, and democracy, and opposed traitorous civil war and dictatorship. Moreover, the Chinese people had tremendous power, and as long as there was no foreign military intervention, they would be able to achieve this task without any external assistance. On the other hand, China's warmongers, dictators, and traitors were isolated and faced many difficulties. Without the assistance of foreign imperialism, they would not be able to fight a civil war today. However, four months later, it was not only difficult to reach new agreements, but it was indeed becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the old agreements. The reason why it is becoming increasingly difficult is none other than the fact that American imperialist elements have given the Chinese reactionaries increasing amounts of various practical assistance. The more this assistance, the more arrogant Chiang Kai-shek becomes, and the lower Marshall's position becomes in front of Chiang Kai-shek. Despite the Communist Party's utmost concessions, it becomes increasingly difficult to reach and maintain agreements. Look at what the Marshall-Stuart joint statement says: the most difficult issue to resolve is none other than the issue of local government. The issue of local government is clearly a political issue. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference stipulate that \"political disputes should be resolved through political methods,\" and that \"in all recovered areas where there are disputes, the government shall temporarily maintain the status quo, and resolve them in accordance with Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the political section of the program of governance after the reorganization of the National Government.\" It can be seen that according to the PCC decision, there is absolutely no reason to resort to force for such issues. To launch a civil war for such issues is a groundless violation of the ceasefire order and the Three Foreign Ministers' resolution that \"internal strife must be stopped.\" Marshall, watching the ceasefire order he personally participated in signing being violated so unreasonably, could only declare that it was impossible to resolve the matter. Marshall's position in Chiang Kai-shek's eyes is truly much lower than it was in January. As for the so-called garrison issue in the military reorganization plan in the Marshall-Stuart joint statement, it can be clearly seen how Chiang Kai-shek completely disregards Marshall. The military reorganization plan was also personally signed by Marshall, but Chiang Kai-shek now suddenly demands its overturning, demanding the occupation of vast areas originally designated for Communist troops to defend. Chiang Kai-shek openly told Marshall and Stuart that the Communist Party must accept five conditions before political negotiations would be allowed. The five conditions were: 1. Surrender the Soviet-Anhui border region. 2. Surrender the Jiaoji Railway. 3. Surrender Chengde and the area south of Chengde. 4. In the Northeast, retreat to Heilongjiang, Xing'an, and Nenjiang provinces and Yanji before October 15th. 5. Shandong and Shanxi provinces must withdraw from the areas occupied after June 7th (these areas were liberated by us from the puppet army after repeated ineffective concessions). Chiang Kai-shek said that otherwise, there would be no way to talk about civil war or government reorganization. It is not difficult to understand that Chiang Kai-shek's presentation of such absurd conditions to Marshall and Stuart is an act of insulting their personal integrity.\n    Therefore, the direct cause of Marshall and Stuart's failure is of course the destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries, whom Marshall called \"stubborn elements.\" The head of this group of Kuomintang reactionaries is none other than Chiang Kai-shek himself. This reactionary head, in the year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, has torn up two agreements and launched two civil wars. Chiang Kai-shek was forced to reluctantly accept the truce agreement and the PCC resolutions in January, but immediately regretted it in February, instigating Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Fang Zhi, and other C.C. reactionaries to use the guise of so-called \"mass organizations\" to violently attack democrats and pro-peace factions within the Kuomintang. This intimidation was deliberately done when Chiang Kai-shek himself left Chongqing. When the intimidation in February failed, the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session was held in March to oppose the PCC resolutions in the name of the \"party\" and to oppose all elements who supported the PCC and the military reorganization plan. When that failed, Chiang Kai-shek himself came forward on April 1st and gave a civil war speech at the National Political Consultative Council, completely overturning the agreements established from January to March. In late March and early April, political negotiations had in fact been destroyed. Replacing political negotiations was the outbreak of a large-scale civil war in the Northeast. Starting on June 7th, there was a 23-day ceasefire, followed by the launch of a large-scale civil war within the passes. On July 15th, Chiang Kai-shek went to Lushan to personally direct the civil war and evade peace negotiations. On August 5th, he put forward five absurd conditions that insulted the personal integrity of Marshall and Stuart. Chiang Kai-shek's goal is to maintain his autocratic dictatorship, which is of course a fatal blow to Marshall's peace efforts.\n    However, why does Chiang Kai-shek, who obeys the will of the US government in everything, dare to undermine Marshall's peace efforts? In fact, it is not that Chiang Kai-shek dares to do so, but that the US government itself is undermining Marshall's work. On February 9th, the US State Department issued an anti-Soviet note to the Chinese government, which encouraged the Kuomintang reactionaries' anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-democratic movement. In March, the US military helped the Kuomintang transport three armies to the Northeast. In April, the US Navy stationed in China arbitrarily transported two Kuomintang armies to the Northeast. In June, the Kuomintang, with the help of the US Navy, was able to transport three more armies to Qingdao and Qinhuangdao. In total, during this period, the Kuomintang transported a total of eight armies to North China by sea and air with the help of the United States, one more army than during the period when the reactionaries Hurley and Wedemeyer were in power. Although the United States did not give the Kuomintang a large loan, the US State Department and Navy systems supplied the Kuomintang with as much as $1.3 billion in materials in the five months after Marshall arrived in China, according to Truman's statement. The US Navy sent two fleets to Qinhuangdao and Qingdao, ostensibly for \"summer vacation,\" and its marines provoked the Eighth Route Army in many directions, leading the way for the Kuomintang. US Secretary of State Byrnes submitted a ten-year military aid to Chiang bill to the House of Representatives, and the State Department repeatedly stated that it would not withdraw troops from China. American imperialist elements are clearly aiding Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out the civil war without any scruples, using this method to rapidly turn China into an American colony. It is particularly noteworthy that the US Navy's actions could disregard the US government's plenipotentiary representative Marshall and act arbitrarily to give the Kuomintang authorities any assistance. The people of China and the United States and fair-minded people have repeatedly warned the US government authorities and the US Navy stationed in China in advance that this policy is incompatible with Marshall's peace activities and is bound to lead to Marshall's failure. Unfortunately, the US authorities still insisted on their erroneous policy, so that Chiang Kai-shek, with the active military assistance of the United States, completely disregarded any peace proposals. The cunning Chiang Kai-shek saw that the US government had two policies: one was to aid Chiang in the civil war, which was fundamental; the other was to help Chiang stop the war, which was a supplement or decoration. Therefore, he accepted the American cannons without hesitation and let the American doves go. However, Marshall himself is not without fault for the failure of the ceasefire work in China. Before General Marshall returned to the United States in March, his prestige was very high, because his behavior at that time was generally fair, he adhered to the principles of peace and democracy, and he had criticized the stubborn elements. Unfortunately, he only limited himself to verbal statements of criticism of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and did not even publicly criticize the American reactionaries and the arrogant navy. On the contrary, he sat idly by as the Kuomintang reactionaries constantly received actual assistance from the American reactionaries and did not stop them. Every time the Kuomintang reactionaries put forward new demands that would undermine the agreements that had been reached, he did not fight for the realization of the agreements that had been reached, but instead disregarded the agreements that had been reached and came to \"mediate\" again, thus making the Kuomintang reactionaries more and more unscrupulous, and Marshall's own position became lower and lower, and more and more despised by the Chinese and American reactionaries. On April 9th, before Marshall came to China again, Chiang Kai-shek had told American reporters that he was \"determined to eliminate the Communist Party\" and that \"now it only depends on the attitude of the United States.\" All the foreign reporters in Chongqing at that time knew about Chiang Kai-shek's statement, and Marshall could not have known about it. In April, the US Navy stationed in China arbitrarily helped Chiang Kai-shek transport two armies to the Northeast. Upon hearing the news, the Communist Party representative immediately protested, but Marshall disregarded the Communist Party representative's protest at the end of April and raised this request again. The Communist Party representative protested again, but in early May, these two armies appeared in the Northeast. Then Marshall pointed out that two more government troops should be transported to Qinhuangdao and Qingdao to \"take over the defense so that the US Marines could withdraw.\" The Communist Party protested, but the result was that three armies were transported there, and the Marines did not withdraw. In May, when fighting in Siping Street and Changchun, Marshall, on the one hand, allowed the US Navy to help Chiang Kai-shek transport troops to the Northeast, and on the other hand, said that if the Communist Party did not withdraw from Changchun, he would not conduct mediation. When the Communist Party expressed its willingness to exchange withdrawal from Changchun for a ceasefire in the Northeast, Marshall said that he was powerless. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek had completely torn up the Northeast Truce Agreement, and Marshall did not insist on a ceasefire in the Northeast, but expressed his willingness to insist on a ceasefire within the passes. By June 17th, Chiang Kai-shek not only demanded almost all nine provinces outside the passes, but also demanded the Soviet-Anhui border region, the Rehe-Chahar provinces, the Longhai and Jinpu railways, and the ports of Weihaiwei and Yantai within the passes. At this time, Marshall did not even insist on a ceasefire within the passes. American reactionary elements helped the Kuomintang reactionary faction to transport troops, equipment, and cooperate in combat step by step, Marshall allowed them to proceed, so that the Kuomintang reactionary faction put forward higher and higher demands: Changchun, Harbin, northern Jiangsu, the five demands, the entire liberated area, and made Marshall's peace activities encounter complete failure, which cannot but make people feel regret and pity!\n    Thus, seven and a half months of \"mediation\" and \"aid to China\" produced a bigger civil war. People can't help but ask the US government: you sent people to help China conclude four major agreements, and then helped the Chinese reactionaries tear them up. Is this set of tricks a predetermined plan? If someone says that the US government's plan is not to implement the resolutions of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference, but to deceive the world and buy time for the Chinese reactionaries to make full preparations for the civil war, then what satisfactory answer can the US government give other than repeating the tasteless old tune?\n    Marshall can declare the failure of his own mission, but the Chinese people will never allow Chiang Kai-shek to carry out the civil war recklessly, nor will they allow the American reactionaries to continue to aid Chiang in the civil war for a long time, making the whole of China devastated. Without the United States \"mediating\" on the one hand and aiding Chiang on the other (in the name of \"mediation,\" but in reality aiding Chiang), and letting the Chinese people take their own path, China could have achieved independence, peace, and democracy long ago. The Chinese people have the strength to solve their own problems. The US government's erroneous policy has created the biggest civil war in Chinese history. After creating such a civil war, if the US government wants to shirk its responsibility, not only will the Chinese people not agree, but the American people, the people of the world, and the governments of the other two countries that participated in the Moscow Conference, as well as all peace-loving United Nations, will never agree.\n    For the US government to change its policy, abolish unilateral aid to Chiang, withdraw its naval, land, and air forces, and sincerely help the Chinese people and all parties to achieve peace and democracy, this is one way; to continue the past deceptive policy, \"mediating\" with one hand and helping Chiang against the Communists and the people with the other, this is another way. Which way to go, may the US government authorities think it over carefully, and may all democratic American people rise up and pay attention.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 七个月总结——评马、司联合声明  解放日报社论\n\n1946-08-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　七个月总结——评马、司联合声明  解放日报社论\n    本月十日，马歇尔与司徒雷登发表了联合声明，正像路透社记者所说，这个联合声明是马歇尔“承认其促成中国和平与团结之努方已实际失败”。从去年十二月下旬马歇尔到了中国以来，在莫斯科三国会议决议的要求下，他亲手帮助中国订立了四大协议：即一月十日停战协议，一月政治协商会议五项协议，二月廿五日整军方案，三月廿七日东北停战协议。现在在他到华七个半月之后，他却自己亲手宣布国共争论的根本问题“似已不可能获得解决”了。事实上，马歇尔的努力在今天不但失败而已，而且今天的内战，比之七个半月以前规模更大了，性质更残酷了。在马歇尔未来以前，蒋介石用来打内战的全力是一百万人，约占其总兵力百分之四十五；现在此项兵力增到差不多两百个师，约两百万人，约占蒋介石总兵力百分之八十五。在马歇尔未来以前，蒋介石的军队用美械装备的为三十九个师，现在则为五十七个师，而且全部用在前线，此外还有由美机编成的空军，美舰编成的海军。当前的内战，对于所谓“调处”与“援华”，简直是残酷的讽刺！\n    马、司联合声明强调获得协议之难，获得协议果真是很难么？为什应从一月至三月能够获得四项极其重大的协议！这些协议之所以获得，是因为一方面中国广大的人民都要独立和平民主，反对卖国内战独裁，而且中国人民有巨大的力量，只要没有外国的军事干涉，就足以不靠任何外力的帮助实现这个任务。另一方面，中国的好战分子、独裁主义者、卖国汉奸是孤立的，困难很多的，没有外国帝国主义的援助，就莫想在今天打内战。但是，四个月以后，不但难于获得新的协议，甚至保持旧的协议也确是越来越难了。所以越来越难的原因，不是别的，正是因为美国帝国主义分子给了中国反动派以日益增多的各种实际的帮助。这种帮助越多，蒋介石就越来越蛮横，马歇尔的地位，在蒋介石面前就越来越降低；尽管中共方面作仁至义尽的让步，获得协议和保持协议也就越来越难。试看马、司联合声明中说，最难解决的问题不是别的，而是地方政权的问题。地方政权问题显然是一个政治问题，政治协商会议决议规定“用政治方法解决政治纠纷”，又规定“凡收复区有争执之地方，政府暂维现状，俟国民政府改组后，依施政纲领政治一项第六、第七、第八三条之规订解决之”。可见依照政协决定，为了这样的问题绝无动武的理由，为了这样的问题而发动内战，乃是毫无理由地破坏停战命令和三外长会议“必须停止内争”的决议。马歇尔眼睁睁看着他所亲自参加签字的停战命令受到如此无理的破坏，竟只能以声明无法解决了事，马歇尔的地位在蒋介石的眼睛里，比起一月份来，真不知低成什么样子了。说到马、司联合声明中的所谓整军问题中的驻地问题，那更可以明明白白看出蒋介石是怎样完全不把马歇尔放在眼里。整军方案也是马歇尔所亲自签字的，但蒋介石现在忽然要求推翻，要求占领原来决定由中共军驻防的广大地区。蒋介石公开告诉马歇尔和司徒雷登，要中共接受五个条件才允政治谈判，五条件为：一、让出苏皖边区。二、让出胶济线。三、让出承德及承德以南地区。四、东北在十月十五日以前退至黑龙江、兴安及嫩江等省与延吉。五、山东、山西两省须退出六月七日后占领地区（这些地区是我们在忍让再三无效之后，在伪军手中解放的）。蒋介石说，否则内战与改组政府都无从谈起。不难明白，蒋介石对马歇尔司徒雷登提出这样的荒谬条件，乃是侮辱马、司二人人格的行为。\n    因此，马、司失败的直接原因，当然是马歇尔所称为“顽固分子”的国民党反动派的破坏，这批国民党反动派的头子不是别人，就是蒋介石自己。就是这个反动派头子，抗战胜利一年以来，已经撕毁两次协议，发动两次内战。蒋介石在一月间被迫勉强接受停战协议与政协决议，二月立即反悔，嗾使陈立夫、谷正纲、方治等Ｃ、Ｃ反动派以所谓“群众团体”的面目，暴力打击民主分子和国民党内的主和派，这一威吓是故意在蒋介石自己离开重庆时做的。二月的威吓不成，三月就开国民党二中全会，以“党”的名义来反对政协决议，和赞成政协的一切分子以及反对整军方案。又不成，四月一日就由蒋介石自己出面，在国民参政会上作了内战演说，完全推翻一月到三月成立的协议，三月末，四月初，政治谈判事实上已被破坏。代替政治谈判的，是东北大规模的内战爆发。六月七日起，停战二十三天，接着就在关内发动大规模内战。七月十五日，蒋介石上庐山亲自指挥内战和逃避和平谈判。八月五日提出侮辱马歇尔、司徒雷登人格的五项荒谬条件。蒋介石的目的在于维持他的专制独裁，这当然是对马歇尔的和平努力的致命打击。\n    但是，一切遵从美国政府意旨的蒋介石，为什么敢于破坏马歇尔的和平努力呢？事实上，并不是蒋介石敢于如此，而是美国政府自己破坏马歇尔的工作。二月九日，美国国务院向中国政府发出反苏照会，这个照会鼓励国民党反动派的反苏反共反民主运动。三月间，美军帮国民党运三个军到东北。四月间，美国驻华海军又擅自运送国民党两个军到东北。六月间，国民党又借着美国海军的帮助，得以再运三个军到青岛及秦皇岛。总计这一时期，国民党由美国帮助，经海道及空中运到华北的军队，共达八个军，比赫尔利、魏德迈等反动派当权时期，还多运了一个军。美国虽然未给国民党以大借款，然而在马歇尔来华后五个月中间，经过国务院及海军系统供给国民党的物资，据杜鲁门声明，即达十三万万美金之多。美海军开了两个舰队到秦皇岛、青岛，名为“避暑”，其陆战队则多方向八路军挑衅，替国民党打先锋，美国国务卿贝纳斯向众院提出十年军事援蒋法案，国务院并一再声称不从中国撤兵，美国帝国主义分子显然肆无忌惮的援助蒋介石进行内战，用这个办法使中国迅速沦为美国的殖民地。特别值得注意的，是美国海军的行为，可以不顾美国政府全权代表马歇尔而擅自行动，给国民党当局以任何帮助。中美两国人民和公正人士，都曾再三预先警告美国政府当局与美国驻华海军的这种政策，是与马歇尔的和平活动不相容的，是必然要造成马歇尔的失败的。可惜美国当局仍然坚持自己的错误政策，以至蒋介石在美国军事积极援助之下，完全不把任何和平建议看在眼里，狡猾的蒋介石看出美国政府有两个政策：一个是援蒋内战，这是基本的；一个是助蒋停战，这是陪衬的或装饰的。因此，他毫不踌躇的接受了美国的大炮，而放了美国的鸽子。可是，对于中国停战工作的失败，马歇尔自己也不是没有错误。马歇尔将军在其三月回美以前，他的声望是很高的，因为他当时的行为，一般是公正的，他对于和平民主的原则是坚持的，他对于顽固分子是曾予以斥责的。但不幸的是，他对于国民党反动派仅仅限于口头的一二声明斥责，对于美国反动派及飞扬跋扈的海军，则甚至连公开的斥责也没有。相反的方面，他坐视着国民党反动派亲到美国反动派不断的实际的接济不去制止，他在国民党反动派每次提出破坏已成协议的新要求来时，并不为已成的协议之实现去奋斗，却不顾已成的协议而来重新“调处”，这样就使国民党反动派越来越肆无忌惮，马歇尔自己的地位就越来越低，越来越被中美反动派所看不起。四月九日，当马歇尔再度来华以前蒋介石已向美国记者表示，他自己是“决心要消灭共产党”，“现在只看美国的态度如何”。蒋介石的这种表示，当时重庆所有的外国记者都知道，马歇尔不会不知道。四月间，美国驻华海军擅自帮蒋介石运两个军去东北，中共代表闻讯，立即抗议，可是马歇尔于四月末不顾中共代表的抗议，再次提出此项要求，中共代表再次抗议，但五月初旬，这两个军已在东北出现了。接着马歇尔又指出要再运两个政府军到秦皇岛、青岛“接替防务，以便美海军陆战队撤退”，中共抗议，可是结果是运去了三个军，而陆战队并未撤退。五月间，四平街、长春作战时，马歇尔一面让美海军帮助蒋介石运兵东北，一面表示中共不撤出长春，则他也不进行调处；及至中共方面表示愿意以退出长春换取东北停战，马歇尔又表示无能为力。当时蒋介石已完全撕毁东北停战协议，马歇尔并不坚持东北停战，但对于关内停战表示还愿意坚持。到了六月十七日，蒋介石不仅提出关外要几乎全部九省，并且提出关内要苏皖边区、热察两省、陇海津浦两路、威海卫烟台两港。此时马歇尔连关内停战也不坚持了。美国反动分子一步步帮助国民党反动派而运兵，而装备，而配合作战，马歇尔任其进行，以至国民党反动派提出一步高一步的要求：而长春、而哈尔滨、而苏北、而五项要求、而全解放区，而使马歇尔的和平活动遇到完全失败，这不能不令人遗憾，令人惋惜！\n    就这样七个半月的“调处”和“援华”，“调处”和“援助”出来一个更大的内战，人们不禁要问问美国政府：你们派人来帮助中国订立四大协议，又帮助中国反动派把它撕毁，这一套手脚是否是预定的计划。如果有人说，美国政府的计划并不是实行三国外长会议决议，而是欺骗世界，替中国反动派争取时间，来进行充分的准备以便进行内战；那末，美国政府除了重弹无味的老调，还能有什么令人满意的答复呢？\n    马歇尔可以宣布他自己使命的失败，但中国人民决不允许蒋介石横行内战，也不容许美国反动派长久援蒋内战下去，把全中国弄得糜烂不堪。没有美国来一面“调处”，一面援蒋（“调处”其名，援蒋其实），而让中国人民自己走自己的路，中国早已可以获得独立和平民主。中国人民是有力量解决自己的问题的，美国政府的错误政策，已经造成中国历史上最大的内战。造成了这样的内战以后，美国政府要卸脱责任，不但中国人民不答应，而且美国人民、世界人民和参与莫斯科会议的其他两国政府，以及一切爱好和平的联合国也决不会答应。\n    美国政府改变政策，废止片面援蒋，撤退海陆空军，诚意帮助中国人民及各党派实现和平民主，这是一条路；继续过去的欺骗政策，一只手“调处”，一只手助蒋反共反人民，这是又一条路，何去何从，愿美国政府当局三思之，更愿一切民主的美国人民起而注意。"

In the new liberated area of 500 li in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, stretching from Daiyue in the north to north of Xinxian city in the south, social order is being rapidly established, and the people are living and working in peace. In the counties of Shanyin, Ningwu, Guo County, Fanshi, and other important towns along the railway line such as Daiyue, Yangfangkou, Daniu Store, Yuanping, and Xinkou, the town public offices, street chiefs, and hundreds of village administrations along the line have all been established through democratic elections by the people. Workers, farmers, women, and merchants in Shuoxian, Ningwu city and other places have successively held meetings to pour out the sufferings they endured during the occupation by the puppet troops. In order to relieve the people's suffering, the democratic government distributed the seized grain and cloth to poor families of martyrs, disaster-stricken masses, and workers. In Ningwu and Daiyue, over 40,000 jin of grain were distributed to over 500 workers. Railway and electric light workers along the line are stepping up repairs to stations and factories, with some employees participating in trade unions and self-defense forces. Chambers of commerce in various towns have also been established one after another. Shops have transported over 10,000 bolts of cloth, 100,000 jin of salt, and about 10,000 shi of grain from the interior, selling them at low prices to small and medium-sized merchants and the masses.\n\nZhangjiakou, 10th. The 600-li railway between Xinkou and Huairen in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway has been actively restored and the railway administration is being reorganized since it came under the management of the democratic government. The entire line is expected to be officially opened to traffic soon. After the establishment of the Tongpu Railway Northern Section Office in mid-July, the first step was to mobilize workers, organize railway trade unions, and provide relief and resolve the problems of unemployment and re-employment for unemployed workers. More than 530 railway workers in Shuoxian, Ningwu, Xuan Gang, and Daiyue have been formally organized. After being liberated, the road workers at each station are extremely enthusiastic in their work, repairing equipment, nailing rails, and building bridges with a spirit of shock work. The existing train cars and locomotives along the line have been completely repaired. When the puppet troops fled, the original station workers automatically repaired a bridge car destroyed by the puppet rebels in just three or four days. Currently, the projects from Daiyue to Shuoxian and from Xinkou to Xuangang are nearing completion. In order to meet the urgent needs of merchants and civilians, it is planned to open the line in sections first.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 同蒲北段五百里新解放区  城乡人民安居乐业  忻口怀仁间六百里铁路即将通车\n\n1946-08-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　同蒲北段五百里新解放区\n    城乡人民安居乐业       \n    忻口怀仁间六百里铁路即将通车\n    【新华社兴县六日电】北起岱岳、南迄忻县城北之同蒲路北段五百里新解放区，社会秩序迅速建立，人民安居乐业。山阴、宁武、崞县、繁峙等县城及铁道线上之岱岳、杨方口、大牛店、原平、忻口等重要市镇，镇公所街闾长以及沿线之数百村政权，均经人民民主选举成立。朔县、宁武城等地之工人、农民、妇女、商人均先后召开会议，倾吐伪军侵占时所遭受的苦难。民主政府为解除人民痛若，将缴获粮食、布匹等分给贫苦烈士家属及遭难群众与工人。宁武、岱岳两地，即发放给五百余工人粮食四万余斤，沿线铁路和电灯工人，正加紧修理车站和工厂，其中一部分职工参加工会和自卫队；各城镇商会，亦先后成立。商店从内地运来布万余匹，盐十万斤，粮食万石左右，贱价卖给中小商人和群众。\n    【张家口十日电】同蒲北段忻口至怀仁间六百里铁道，自归民主政府管理后，即积极从事修复，整顿路政，不日全线即将正式通车。七月中旬，同蒲路北段办事处成立后，首先发动工人，组织铁路工会，救济与解决失业工人之生活与复业问题。朔县、宁武、轩岗、岱岳有五百三十余铁路工人正式组织起来。各站路工翻身后，工作热情极高，以突击精神整顿器材，钉修道轨，建立桥梁，沿线现有之车皮机车已整修完竣，原车站工人当伪军逃窜后，三四日即自动修竣被伪逆破坏之桥车一个。现岱岳至朔县，忻口至轩岗之工程即将竣工，为适应商民急需，拟先行分段通车。"

The British side intended to include Austria among the invited countries, but quickly withdrew its suggestion. The plenary session also elected French representative Dubarle as Secretary-General of the conference. In the afternoon, the plenary session debated Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi's statement to the conference. Yugoslav representative Kardelj declared: De Gasperi had requested that the territory of other countries be given to Italy. Therefore, Yugoslavia suspects whether the Italian government will use the achievements of the Italian anti-fascist struggle to support its imperialist demands. Kardelj asserted that De Gasperi's population statistics on Venezia Giulia were based on fabricated materials. De Gasperi had stated that if the French demarcation line were adopted, Italy's doors would be wide open. However, everyone knows that aggression has always come from Italy, not Yugoslavia. Kardelj also stated that De Gasperi is repeating the tactics used by the Italian representatives during the First World War. Kardelj finally pointed out that he absolutely opposes De Gasperi's request to delay the resolution of the Trieste and Venezia Giulia issues for a year. According to De Gasperi, in his statement to the conference on the 10th, he detailed Italy's participation in the opposition to fascist Germany in the later stages of the war and stated that this situation was not adequately reflected in the preamble to the Italian Peace Treaty. De Gasperi emphasized the \"dangerousness\" of the Council of Foreign Ministers' decision on the Venezia Giulia and Trieste issue and complained greatly about it, insisting that the Italian-Yugoslav border should be based on the Wilson Line, which would assign most of the Venezia Giulia region and other important cities to Italy.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: The Paris Peace Conference has concluded its second week of work and adjourned yesterday. The second week of the conference focused on the debate over voting rules, which still falls within the scope of procedural rules. The five treaty draft committees may officially begin work this week, and the entire conference may conclude one week or ten days before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly (September 23rd). Today is the first day of the third week of the conference, and it will be chaired by Benes. The plenary session will discuss Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi's statement and Albania's participation in the conference.

    "content": "How Did Cuiqu Open Up the Situation?\n\nCuiqu is a village in the second district of Handan that has done relatively well in its work. As early as 1941, we had secret anti-Japanese work there. In May of last year, a struggle was launched to settle accounts with An Yugui, the local tyrant landlord and pseudo-cooperative director. After the liberation of Handan, land was returned and capital was increased. The well-digging expenses of several landlords were settled. Various village organizations were established, and most of the cadres had been engaged in underground struggle for several years. However, the masses had not been mobilized.\n\nWhen the comrades of the Turn-Over Team first arrived in this village, the cadres generally expressed complacency, believing that there were no major issues in the village, that the main landlords had already been struggled against, that the land had been obtained, and that various organizations were in place, and that everyone had been emancipated. As for whether they were thoroughly emancipated, everyone felt that there was no definite standard. Some cadres said: \"It's like drinking water. We were very thirsty in the past, and now we've drunk a bowl and feel settled. It's hard to say whether we're still thirsty or not.\" Others, although they felt dissatisfied, didn't dare to mention it, doubting whether they could struggle again, or whether it would be excessive. The masses generally expressed dissatisfaction, believing that they were far from being emancipated, and had only \"flexed a muscle\" without really stretching out. Further struggle was not possible, as the landlords were still better off, and they didn't dare to turn over without orders from above.\n\nThe reasons for this phenomenon are mainly that the leadership in the past was too restrictive, setting many boundaries for the masses: such as retaining components, retaining landlords as rich peasants, and rich peasants as middle peasants, on the grounds that landlords don't know how to work and should have enough property to hire long-term laborers; not thoroughly settling accounts, as thorough settlement is equal to egalitarianism (i.e., compensating with all property); not completely overthrowing them in one struggle, leaving some opinions for future struggles; not struggling too fiercely, so as not to frighten the landlords in other villages; if the struggle is excessive, the fruits should be returned, so it's better to struggle less at first. Due to these many restrictions, six landlords were struggled against, and the original compensation of 5.25 million was reduced to 1.33 million under orders from above. On one occasion, the masses had already reduced the amount as ordered, but the comrades of the special commissioner's office still felt it was too much and wanted the masses to reduce it further. When reducing, the landlord's total property was not taken into account, only the landlord's land. As a result, the landlord took out money without selling much land. The six landlords who were struggled against originally had 1,184 mu of land, but only 324 mu were sold, and some were still retained as landlords. Secondly, under the influence of the restrictions imposed by the higher-level leadership, the village cadres monopolized everything, and only struggled at cadre meetings. After calculating and reducing everything, they would announce it to the masses and pass it as usual. The struggled against not only did not bow their heads and admit their mistakes in front of the masses, but the masses also did not see their own strength. Thirdly, in the distribution of the fruits of struggle, those who were wronged and offered opinions only received a small reward, while the village cadres received the most; when buying land, the cadres also rushed to the front. Therefore, many people complained: \"It's the same to get money without giving opinions as everyone else, and we don't offend anyone. Why should we give opinions?\" The money used to establish cooperatives from the struggle funds was not used for production, but only solved the difficulties of a few people. The fruits of past struggles were still delayed in distribution, and the accounts were never made public. In addition, the cadres did not approach the masses and had a bad attitude, which created a gap between the cadres and the masses.\n\nBased on the above situation, the comrades of the Turn-Over Team decided to strengthen the education of cadres, review past work, break the shackles, and inspire the spirit of struggle; to clean up the fruits of struggle, improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, and continue to go deep into the masses, understand the situation, and inspire struggle. In reviewing the past work, the general village cadres easily accepted it, but when proposing to clean up the accounts and improve relations with the masses, some cadres resisted. At that time, some cadres in nearby villages were dismissed and detained for corruption and degeneration, and some bad elements in this village were also using various excuses to provoke the masses. Therefore, they believed that cleaning up the accounts was mainly to find their mistakes, that the bad elements had succeeded in provoking, and that they would lose face. Therefore, they launched complaints, worked negatively, and were emotionally opposed to the comrades of the Turn-Over Team, and it was difficult to explain it at the time.\n\nAt this time, An Yugui, the object of struggle who had fled in the past, returned. The comrades of the Turn-Over Team realized that it was easy to cause internal disputes by only cleaning up internal problems, and that internal problems could only be solved in the struggle against the outside. Therefore, they decided to detain An Yugui and focus on arranging the struggle. The first step was to review the ideology of change of dynasty, which seriously affected everyone at that time, among the cadres and the masses, and then mobilize everyone to tell their grievances. In the middle of this process, the village cadres found that some good people were following the bad elements, not only could they not be mobilized, but they also gave opinions to the cadres, and everyone felt very distressed and had no way out. Therefore, the comrades of the Turn-Over Team once again proposed that the cadres review themselves, clean up the accounts, eliminate the rumors and provocations of the bad elements, and win over the good people. At this time, the cadres had personal experience and quickly accepted this opinion. Everyone realized that if one is not righteous oneself, one cannot correct others, and that reviewing and correcting oneself is not bowing one's head to the bad elements, but fighting against the bad elements. Therefore, the fruits that had not yet been processed were quickly distributed, and special compensation was given to the wronged households. The fruits obtained by the cadres were the same as those of the masses, and the accounts of the cooperative were also cleared. After such internal reorganization, the eyes of the masses had turned to the fighters, and everyone quickly reunited around the cadres. Later, after small grievance meetings and continuous networking, on the 28th of last month, the unprecedented mass grievance struggle meeting in Cuiqu Village was finally launched. From the detention of An Yugui to the opening of the meeting, it took thirteen days of preparation.\n\nAt the struggle meeting, twenty or thirty people told their grievances, and many people were unable to tell their grievances due to time constraints. Everyone jointly accused An Yugui of killing five people, including one of our militia captains, informing the enemy and arresting thirteen militiamen and anti-Japanese masses. One person who used to be An Yugui's pack mule was eventually sent to the enemy's prison. When everyone was telling their grievances, there was a burst of crying, which caused everyone in the audience to shed tears. When talking about An Yugui's meanness and oppression of the poor, everyone immediately took down the plaque \"Charitable and Kind\" on his door and threw it on the ground. Finally, the government responded to everyone's request and sentenced An Yugui to death and confiscated his property.\n\nAfter the meeting, when asked if the cadres had any opinions in the village, they all excitedly said, \"There are so many!\" The masses said that they can now really stretch their grievances. During the meeting, many cadres and masses from other villages automatically rushed to participate. After the meeting, they all asked the comrades of the Turn-Over Team to quickly go to their villages to help with the work. Some villages, such as Beizhai Haozhuang, which was a relatively backward village, the cadres immediately and automatically detained the local tyrant landlord after returning and launched a struggle. Now, the nearby villages are generally surging into the struggle.\n\nIn opening up the work in Cuiqu Village, the main experience gained by the comrades of the Turn-Over Team is that in villages like Cuiqu, where we have had long-term work under the rule of the enemy and puppets, due to the lack of education in the past, coupled with the restrictions imposed by the leadership in the past, many problems will inevitably remain among the cadres, but they are basically good. Today, they should be encouraged to immediately lead the turn-over movement, and in the movement, they should be gradually educated and transformed through their own experience. Do not first clean up internal problems, as internal problems are not easy to solve at one time, but instead prevent the work from being carried out quickly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 崔曲是怎样打开局面的？\n朱穆之\n1946-08-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　崔曲是怎样打开局面的？\n    崔曲是邯郸二区工作较好的村庄，在一九四一年时就有我们的抗日秘密工作。去年五月间曾发动过斗争，向本村恶霸地主伪合作社长安玉贵算账。邯郸解放后，进行了回地增资，并向几户地主清算了敌人的打井款，村里各种组织建立了起来，干部大多是在地下斗争了好几年的，但是群众并未发动起来。\n    当翻身队的同志刚到这村的时候，干部一般表示自满，认为村里没有啥大事了，几户主要地主已斗争过了，地也得了，各种组织也有了，大家已经翻身了。至于是否翻透，大家觉得没有一定的标准，有的干部说：好比喝水，过去渴得很，现在已喝了一碗心定了，一时说不上还渴不渴。有的虽然也觉得不满足，但不敢提，怀疑能否再斗，是否过火。至于群众则普遍表示不满，认为离翻身还远，只骨隆一下，还没有欠一欠身呢；再翻也不行，还是人家好过，没有上级命令不敢翻。\n    造成这种现象的原因，主要是过去领导上束手束脚，给群众划定了许多范围：如保留成分，地主保留为富农，富农保留为中农，理由是地主不会劳动，应该让他有足够财产雇得起长工；不应彻底清算，彻底清算是均产（即将全部家产赔偿出来）；不应一次斗倒，留下几个意见以后好再斗；不要斗得太凶，把别的村庄的地主吓咆了；斗得过火了，要把果实倒回去，不如先斗得小一些。由于这许多限制，斗争了六户地主，原该包赔五百二十五万，在上级命令之下，减为一百三十三万。有一次群众已遵令减了，专署工作队的同志，还嫌多，又要群众减。减的时候，不以地主全部财产计算在内，只计算地主的土地，结果地主拿出了钱，并未卖去多少土地。被斗争的六户地主原有一千一百八十四亩，只卖去三百二十四亩，有的依然保留为地主。其次，在上级领导处处限制的影响之下，村干部包办一切，村干部只在干部会上来斗。算和减，一切弄好以后，才向群众宣布一下，照例通过。被斗争者既不到群众面前低头认过，群众也看不到自己的力量。第三，在分配斗争果实时，被屈而提意见的人只得少数奖励，村干部反分得最多；买土地时，干部也抢在前面。因此有许多群众抱怨说：“不提意见和大家一样分钱，又不得罪人，咱提意见干啥”。在斗争款里提出成立合作社的款，未进行生产，只给少数人解决了困难。过去斗争果实还有拖延未分的，账目都从未公布过。再加干部不接近群众，态度不好，因此造成了干部与群众间的隔阂。\n    根据上面情形，翻身队的同志决定加强教育干部，检讨过去工作，打破束缚，启发斗争情绪；清理斗争果实，改善干部与群众关系，并继续深入群众，了解情况，启发斗争。在检讨过去工作中，一般村干部容易接受，但在提出清理账目，改善与群众关系时，有些干部就发生抵拒。当时附近村庄有些干部因贪污蜕化被撤职扣押，本村有一些坏分子也正在利用种种借口挑拨群众，因此他们认为清理账目，主要是找他们的错，坏分子挑拨成功了，自己要丢人，因此发起牢骚，工作消极，情绪上与翻身队的同志对立起来，一时解释不开。\n    这时正好过去逃跑的斗争对象安玉贵回来了，翻身队的同志认识到仅只是清理内部问题，反容易造成内部纠纷，只有在大家一致对外的斗争中，才容易解决内部问题，因此决定把安玉贵扣起来，并把工作重点放在布置斗争上。首先是在干部与群众中检讨当时严重影响大家的变天思想，进一步再发动大家诉苦，在这中间，村干部发现有些好群众跟随着坏分子走，不仅动员不起来，反而对干部提意见，大家感到很苦恼，没有办法。于是翻身队的同志再度提出干部检讨自己，清理账目，消灭坏分子造谣挑拨借口，争取好群众。这时干部有了切身体验，很快接受了这个意见，大家认识到己不正不能正人，检讨与改正自己，不是向坏分子低头，正是向坏分子作斗争。于是迅速分配尚未处理的果实，对被屈户特别予以包赔，干部所得果实与群众一样，又清算合作社账目等，经过了这样内部的一些整理，群众眼光已转到斗争者身上，大家迅速团聚到干部周围了。以后经过诉苦人小会，以及不断的串连，终于在上月二十八日展开了崔曲村前所未有的群众的诉苦斗争大会。从扣起安玉贵到开大会，前后经过了十三天的酝酿时间。\n    在斗争大会上，诉苦的有二三十人，有许多人因时间关系未能诉。大家共诉出安玉贵害死五条人命，内有我民兵队长一人，向敌人告密捕去民兵及抗日群众十三人，有一个原是一贯给安玉贵当驮脚驴的，最后不免也被送进了敌人的牢狱。大家在诉苦时，一片哭声，引起全场落泪，在诉及安玉贵刻薄欺压穷人时，大家当场把他门上“乐善好施”的匾撤在地下。最后政府答复大家要求，对安玉贵处以死刑并没收财产。\n    会后，当问及干部村里还有啥意见时，都兴奋的说，“可多哩”！群众则表示，现在可以好好伸伸冤了。开会时，有许多自动从外村赶来参加的干部及群众，会后都要翻身队同志赶快到他村去帮助工作，有的村子，如北寨郝庄，原是较落后的村子，干部回去后立即自动将恶霸地主扣起来，进行了斗争。现在附近村庄，正普遍涌进斗争中去。\n    在打开崔曲村的工作中，翻身队的同志获得的主要经验是像崔曲这样在敌伪统治下即有我们长期工作的村庄，由于过去缺乏教育，再加过去领导上束手束脚，必然在干部中会存留很多问题，但基本上是好的，今天应该鼓励他们立即领导翻身运动，在运动中再以他们自身的经验逐步加以教育改造，不要首先来清理内部问题，那样内部问题既一时不易解决，反使工作不能迅速展开。"

    "content": "Breaking Through Key Points, Lighting Fires Everywhere\nHandan's Second District Launches Anti-Traitor Liquidation\nDistrict Cadres and Central Government Turn-Over Teams Deepen into the Masses to Create Experience\n\n[This newspaper Handan News] The Handan County Second District cadres and the Central Government's peasant turn-over team, in a month of exploration, discovered a way to open up the situation and carry out work: that is, it is necessary to launch a universal mass anti-traitor accusation upsurge, liquidate the blood debts of the enemy and puppets over the past eight years, overwhelm the evil forces, promote national righteousness, in order to break the remaining rule of traitors, spies, bullies, and stubborn landlords who are combined in the countryside, inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, rectify mass organizations, and lay the foundation for peasants to further reduce rent and liquidate, solve the land problem, achieve land to the tiller, and completely turn over. After the team went to the countryside at the end of June, after breaking through key points, gaining experience, and understanding the situation, and after a short period of training village cadres, they implemented the policy of lighting fires everywhere. Recently, the masses throughout the district have begun to move towards a universal mass anti-traitor liquidation struggle.\n\nAfter the comrades of the team went to the countryside, they and the district cadres were scattered in eight key villages. They led more than 20 struggles against traitors and bullies, with more than 30,000 people participating. They patiently carried out persuasive education for backward village cadres. Some comrades even accompanied the villagers to hoe the fields, water the fields, watch melon sheds, and rescue from floods. Finally, they realized the many complex problems left over in this area after the increased assets, rent reduction, and land redemption movements. After the liberation of Handan, anti-traitors were not carried out first, the traitor and puppet elements were not sanctioned, and they still ran rampant in the countryside, and took the opportunity to drill into mass organizations, militia organizations, and even village political power, secretly manipulating their leadership. Landlords and peasants were prematurely stimulated by the movement to increase assets and reduce rent. As a result, stubborn landlords, bullies, and traitorous elements combined to counterattack tenants by various means and sabotage the peasant turn-over movement. The interests of middle peasants and poor peasants (such as enemy and puppet extortion, debts, burdens, etc.) have not been properly resolved, so they have become wait-and-see and hesitant to participate enthusiastically in the movement, and tenants have fallen into isolation. At the same time, the leaders who emerged in the tenant movement also led the struggle to reduce rent and increase assets, but due to the leadership's inappropriately raising the status of tenants in the past, only giving them leadership powers but lacking correct ideological education, coupled with the influence and indoctrination of individual district cadres' bad work styles, many tenant cadres became arrogant, indulgent, dictatorial, corrupt, and alienated from the masses, which not only aroused dissatisfaction among middle peasants and poor peasants, but most tenant masses also developed a sense of revulsion towards them. Traitors, spies, bullies, and stubborn landlords used these contradictions to create opposition between trade unions, farmers' associations, and militias, disputes between front and back streets, clans, and factions in a village, and disunity between villages by various despicable methods such as rumor-mongering, instigation, threats, and enticements. In addition, they used both hard and soft tactics to sandwich and attack, turning some tenant cadres into prisoners of the rural reactionary camp in order to suppress the masses' turn-over struggle. In another type of village, our work had a considerable foundation during the War of Resistance. Some old village cadres made some contributions to the War of Resistance. Since the liberation of Handan, they also led the masses to struggle against increased assets, reduced rent, redeemed land, and fought against traitors and bullies. However, due to lack of leadership, lack of ideological education, undemocratic practices, self-importance, unfair distribution of fruits, and undertaking everything on behalf of the masses without fully mobilizing them, they also became alienated from the masses. There were many cries of dissatisfaction from below, \"cadres have turned over, but the masses have not turned over.\" This type of village cadre also made the masses afraid, afraid to speak, afraid to reflect problems, becoming a great difficulty in mobilizing the masses. Although organizational cleansing and struggle against individual important traitorous elements had been carried out in the previous stage of the anti-traitor struggle, the masses were still not fully mobilized, and the above-mentioned complex problems were not resolved, and the foundation of the rural reactionary camp was not shaken.\n\nTwo Hundred and Eighty-Five Village Cadres Go to Ninety-Two Villages to Light Fires\n\nAfter the district cadres and the turn-over team comrades understood the essence of the above-mentioned situation in each key village and created some experience in transforming old village cadres, cultivating new activists, and transforming mass organizations manipulated by traitors, bullies, and stubborn landlords, they decided at the July 15th meeting to train village cadres in large numbers, implement the policy of lighting fires everywhere, and universally launch the anti-traitor liquidation movement. The training classes were held in eight locations. A total of 285 trainees came from 92 administrative villages. Among these people, there were relatively pure old village cadres and new activists, as well as old village cadres with mistakes. The training class did not instill any articles to the masses, but the masses educated themselves with their own and their villages' experience. Everyone very kindly told about the suffering they had suffered throughout their lives, and accused the enemy and puppets of their crimes over the past eight years. Many kind farmers recalled the tragic past and wept.\n\nFurther, everyone traced the root of these sufferings. After careful accounting, everyone understood that they should be the masters, but their blood and sweat fed a group of parasites. Everyone also reviewed why the masses had not been completely turned over after Handan was liberated for ten months. Activists revealed the crimes of traitors, spies, bullies, and illegal landlords in oppressing the masses and bribing village cadres, and also criticized some village cadres for corruption, degeneration, and taking the landlord line. Cadres who had made mistakes in villages such as Jia Village and Jia Village made confessions. A trade union representative painfully recounted how the landlord gave him cigarettes to smoke, cooked good food for him, and used his daughter-in-law to seduce him and instigate him to assassinate good cadres. Many trade union representatives, farmer association directors, and militia captains made similar confessions and reflections. Everyone warmly welcomed their repentance and progress. Finally, in the training class, the activists and the repented village cadres unanimously and solemnly took an oath to get rid of the old work styles of corruption, degeneration, and taking the landlord line in the past, establish new work styles of integrity, putting the public before private interests, and taking the mass line, and vowed to work hard for the complete turn-over of the masses. In this training class, the old cadres received preliminary transformation, the new cadres received ideological education, reviewed the past work, and arranged for future struggles. Everyone gained sufficient confidence and courage for their own turn-over. At the same time, the district cadres and the turn-over team comrades roughly recognized the true face of each village in the district through this training class and discovered many new activists. These have become the foundation for lighting fires everywhere and opening up the situation in the entire district. This is exactly the case. Not many days after the end of the training class, the trainees lit fires in their own villages, and the comrades of the turn-over team also dispersed from the eight key villages to more than 30 small key points to \"refuel and turn on the lights\" everywhere. The fire of the peasant masses' turn-over burned most of the villages in the district.\n\nWhere is this flame burning? What are the masses doing after they are mobilized? The answer is very clear: organize a universal mass anti-traitor accusation upsurge.\n\nOrganize the Masses to Accuse Traitors and the Fire of Turn-Over Burns\n\nThe 14 villages with Qichadao Village as the core are at the forefront of the entire district. Not only was their training class the most practical and best, but they also created some experience for the entire district in the anti-traitor accusation struggle. This anti-traitor struggle is a broad united front movement of all classes of people in the countryside. The purpose is to liquidate the big traitors who have committed heinous crimes, and at the same time wash the faces of the traitor and puppet personnel, let them reflect and confess, reform themselves, and be good people again. In Qichadao Village and its surrounding villages, the masses have been organized into many \"accusation groups\" under the leadership of trained activists, and the traitor and puppet personnel have been organized into many \"confession groups.\" The two groups are working tensely at the same time. The time for the meeting is during the cool-off time and after dinner, because these masses are free when they come back from hoeing the fields. In the \"accusation group,\" the masses complained about the crimes of the traitors over the past eight years: killing, beating, scolding, pulling out old cotton from the masses' cotton clothes and quilts, searching for the little remaining grain of the masses, and offering it to the Japanese invaders. The masses scolded traitors and puppet troops for selling the country and selling their ancestors. They automatically proposed to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's serving as a \"puppet army\" for the United States, because the Chiang army used American guns and cannons, was trained by the United States, and fought a civil war in order to sell China to the United States. Its shameful role was similar to that of the Japanese puppet army. The traitor and puppet personnel in the \"confession group\" have all found guarantors, and each person has a notebook. Any criminal facts that come to mind are recorded in the notebook by themselves or by others for confession at the meeting. They have all reported some of their crimes more or less, and realized that \"without them, four Japanese people could not rule the Second District.\" They said: \"They sold the East Second District, and Chiang Kai-shek sold the entire China.\" They hoped that Chiang Kai-shek would also confess to the people of the whole country. A few traitorous elements who have committed serious crimes are still unwilling to bow their heads to the masses. Now the accusing masses and the personnel who have confessed and reformed themselves are jointly preparing to carry out a serious struggle against them. In the mass anti-traitor accusation struggle that combines the two trends of accusation and confession, it is full of combat voices against Chiang Kai-shek's serving as a \"puppet army\" for the United States, against the civil war, defending the hometown, and defending the People's Liberation Army.\n\n(Wu Min)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 突破基点到处点火  邯郸二区展开反奸清算  区干部与中直翻身队深入群众创造经验\n吴敏\n1946-08-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　突破基点到处点火\n    邯郸二区展开反奸清算         \n    区干部与中直翻身队深入群众创造经验\n    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸县第二区区干部与中直农民翻身队，在一个月来的摸索中，发现了一条打开局面、开展工作的道路：就是必须掀起一个普遍的群众性的反奸控诉高潮，清算敌伪八年来的血债，压倒邪气，伸张民族正气，才能打破汉奸、特务、恶霸、顽固地主互相结合的在农村的残余统治，启发群众的热情，整顿群众的组织，为农民进一步减租清算、解决土地问题、达到耕者有其田、彻底翻身打下基础。该队六月底下乡后，经过突破基点，取得经验，了解情况，又经过短期训练村干，实行到处点火，最近全区群众正开始走向普遍的群众性的反奸清算斗争。\n    该队同志们下乡之后与区干部分散在八个基点村，他们领导过二十几次反对汉奸恶霸的斗争，有三万多群众参加。他们耐心地进行过对于落后村干的说服教育，有的同志还陪老乡们在田里锄地、浇水、看瓜棚，抢救水灾，终于认识了这个地区经过增资、减租、赎地运动后所遗留下来的许多复杂问题。邯郸解放之后，首先没有进行反奸，奸伪分子没有受到制裁，依然在农村中横行霸道，并乘机钻进群众团体，民兵组织甚至村政权中，部分窃取其领导，暗中操纵。地主和农民过早受到了增资减租的刺激，结果，顽固地主、恶霸和奸伪分子相结合，用种种办法向雇佃反攻，并破坏农民翻身运动。中农和贫农的利益（如敌伪讹诈、债务、负担等等）没有得到适当解决，因此他们走向观望徘徊没有热烈参加运动，雇佃陷于孤立。同时，在雇佃运动中涌现出来的领袖，他们也领导过减租增资斗争，但由于过去领导上不适当地抬高雇佃的地位，只给以领导的职权而缺乏正确的思想教育，再加上个别区干不良作风的影响和熏染，以致不少雇佃干部骄傲、放纵、独断专行、贪污、受贿、脱离群众，不仅引起中农、贫农的不满，而多数雇佃群众也对他们发生反感。汉奸、特务、恶霸和顽固地主就利用这些矛盾，用种种鄙卑方法如造谣、挑拨、威胁、利诱等等，造成工会、农会、民兵之间的对立，一村中前街、后街、宗族、派别的纠纷以及村与村之间的不团结。此外，他们更软硬兼施，两面夹击，把一部分雇佃干部变成农村反动阵营的俘虏，以压制群众的翻身斗争。在另一类型的村庄中，我们的工作在抗战中曾有相当基础，有些老村干对抗战有些贡献，邯郸解放以来，也曾领导群众增资、减租、赎地、反奸反恶霸的斗争，但由于缺乏领导，缺乏思想教育，不民主，自高自满，分果实不公，包办代替，没充分发动群众，因此也形成他们脱离群众，下面很多“干部翻了身，群众没翻身”的不满呼声。这一类的村干，也使群众害怕，不敢说话，不敢反映问题，成为发动群众的很大困难。虽然在前一阶段反奸斗争中实行过清洗组织并斗争过个别重要奸伪分子，但依然没有充分发动群众，以上这些复杂问题并未得到解决，更没有动摇农村反动阵营的基础。\n            二百八十五个村干部到九十二个村去点火\n    区干部与翻身队的同志们在各基点村了解了上述情况的实质并创造了若干改造老村干，培养新积极分子，改造奸伪、恶霸、顽固地主所操纵的群众团体的经验之后，就在七月十五日的会议上决定大量训练村干，实行到处点火，普遍开展反奸清算运动的方针。训练班分八处举行。九十二个行政村共来了二百八十五个受训者。这些人中，有比较纯洁的老村干与新积极分子，也有带着错误的老村干。训练班不是给群众灌输什么条文，而是群众用自身和本村的经验教育自己。大家很亲切地诉说了一辈子所遭受的苦难，控诉了敌伪八年来的罪恶。有许多良善的农民回忆起惨痛的过去，泣不成声。\n    进一步大家又追寻了这些苦难的根源。经过细密的算账，大家懂得了自己应当是主人，而自己的血汗却喂养了一批寄生虫。大家又检讨了邯郸解放已十个月，为什么群众没能彻底翻身。积极分子们揭发了汉奸、特务、恶霸、不法地主欺压群众与贿买村干的罪恶，同时也批评了一部分村干贪污、腐化、走地主路线等错误。贾庄、夹地等村犯过错误的干部，做了坦白。一个工会代表沉痛地诉说了地主如何给他烟吸，给他做好饭吃，并用自己的儿媳勾引他，唆使他暗杀好干部等丑恶行为，有不少工会代表，农会主任，民兵队长作了类似的坦白反省。大家热忱地欢迎他们的改悔和进步。最后，在训练班里，积极分子们与改悔了的村干们又一致庄严地举行宣誓，革除过去贪污、腐化、走地主路线的旧作风，建立廉洁、先公后私、走群众路线的新作风，誓愿为群众的彻底翻身而努力。在这个训练班里，旧干部得到了初步改造，新干部得到了思想教育，检讨了过去的工作，布置了以后的斗争，大家对于自己的翻身，获得了足够的信心和勇气。同时区干部和翻身队的同志们经过了这个训练班，大致认识了全区各村的真面貌，发现了许多新的积极分子。这些都成为到处点火，全区打开局面的基础。事实也正是这样。训练班结束不几天，受训者都在自己的村里点起火来，翻身队的同志们也从八个基点村分散到三十多个小基点，到处去“加油拨灯”。农民群众的翻身之火把全区大部分村庄燃烧起来了。\n    这个火焰往那里烧呢？群众发动起来干什么呢？答案是很明确的：组织普遍的群众性的反奸控诉高潮。\n            组织群众反奸控诉  翻身烈火燃烧起来\n    以七岔道村为核心的十四个村庄走在全区的最前面。不仅他们的训练班办的最实际最好，就是在反奸控诉斗争中他们也给全区创造了一些经验。这个反奸斗争是农村各阶层人民联合的广泛统一战线的运动，其目的是清算罪大恶极的大汉奸，同时给奸伪人员洗脸，让他们反省坦白，改过自新，重做好人。在七岔道村及其周围各村，群众已在受过训的积极分子们领导之下，编成许多“控诉小组”，而奸伪人员们则被编成许多“坦白小组”。两种小组同时紧张工作着。开会的时间是歇凉时和晚饭后，因为这些群众们锄地回来的空闲时候。在“控诉小组”里，群众申诉汉奸们八年来的罪恶：杀人、打人、骂人、扯出群众棉衣棉被中的旧棉花，搜出群众仅余的一点粮食，供俸日寇等等。群众斥骂汉奸、皇协军，卖国家、卖祖宗。他们自动提出反对蒋介石给美国当“皇协军”，因为蒋军用美国枪炮，受美国训练，为了把中国卖给美国而打内战，其可耻的作用，是和当日寇皇协军差不多的。“坦白小组”里的奸伪人员们，都找了保人，每人还有一个笔记本，随时想到的罪恶事实，就由自己或请人在笔记本上记下来以备在会上坦白。他们都或多或少报告了自己一些罪恶，并且认识了“如果没有他们，四个日本人是不能统治二区的。”他们说：“他们卖的是东二区，蒋介石卖的是全中国。”他们希望蒋介石也向全国人民坦白。少数罪恶重大的奸伪分子，还不愿向群众低头，现在控诉的群众们和已经坦白自新的人员们正联合准备对他们进行严重的斗争。在控诉与坦白两股潮流相结合的群众性反奸控诉斗争里，充满着反对蒋介石给美国当“皇协军”，反对内战，保卫家乡，保卫解放军的战斗声音。\n                                                        （吴敏）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, 13th: The New Fourth Army in central Jiangsu has annihilated two more divisions of Chiang's invading army in the self-defense battle east of Hai'an. After Chiang's army occupied Hai'an on the night of the 2nd of this month (referring to Chen Cheng's so-called \"change of defense\" and \"adjustment\" of the Yangzhou-Hai'an line), they further increased their troops and continued to invade eastward, dragging the New 7th Division (now reorganized as a brigade) of the Songhu Garrison into the battle. From the 6th to the 8th, they successively occupied Xichang, Dingjiashuo, Libao, Jiaoxie, and other towns east and northeast of Hai'an, ravaging the near-sea area of more than eighty li east-west and more than twenty li north-south from Hai'an town. A part of the New Fourth Army launched a counterattack at 12:00 PM on the 10th, and the battle ended at 6:00 PM on the 11th. It is estimated that the entire New 7th Division of the 11th Army (now renamed as a division) and most of the 105th Division (now renamed as a brigade) of the 49th Army (now renamed as a division) were annihilated (lacking one regiment). According to preliminary statistics, more than 5,000 Chiang's troops were captured, more than 3,000 were killed or wounded, and the seized items are being inventoried. The New Fourth Army immediately recovered Lifaqiao (nine li east of Hai'an) and all the occupied towns east of it. This is the third annihilating blow to the invading Chiang's army by the New Fourth Army guarding the southern line of central Jiangsu. The previous two times were the Taixing Campaign and the southern suburb of Rugao campaign in the middle and late last month. In these two campaigns, a total of approximately 20,000 Chiang's troops were annihilated, including the direct subordinate team of the 49th Army headquarters and the entire 26th Division, one regiment of the 79th Division, the entire 19th Division of the 100th Army, and one battalion of the 99th Division of the 99th Army (after the \"reorganization\" of Chiang's army, the armies were renamed divisions, and the divisions were renamed brigades). When invading Hai'an, Chiang's army also suffered more than 3,000 casualties. So far, the invading Chiang's army in Jiangsu and Anhui has lost more than 31,000 officers and soldiers on the southern line of central Jiangsu alone, and the three divisions of the 49th Army under Wang Tiehan have almost been completely destroyed. However, the Central News Agency has remained silent about the above three major setbacks of Chiang's army in the offensive and has tried its best to cover them up to prevent military morale from shaking.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Huaihai Front, 11th: The Central China New Fourth Army recovered Pingshan, Laoshan, Changzhigou, and other places in Si County yesterday, eliminating three battalions of Chiang's army. The 7th Army of Chiang's army, which invaded eastward along the Jinpu Railway, occupied Lingbi, Wuhe, Si County, and other places in the Huaihai liberated area in late last month and continued to invade. A unit of the New Fourth Army launched a self-defense counterattack on the 7th, and after four days of combat, by the 10th, the three battalions of Chiang's army occupying Pingshanji (20 li north of Si County, occupied on July 29th), Laoshanji, and Changzhigou (more than 20 li northwest of Si County, occupied on July 26th) were completely annihilated, and a part of the Chiang's army reinforcements south of Si County were eliminated. In this battle, more than 1,000 Chiang's troops were captured, and the results are being inventoried. So far, the Chiang's army, which occupied Si County on the 27th of last month, has been heavily surrounded, and the New Fourth Army is urging it to lay down its arms voluntarily.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 13th: More than 400 men of the 1st Battalion of the 15th Transportation Column of the Kuomintang at Nanquan Station (40 li west of Jimo City) on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, led by Battalion Commander Wang Yifen, staged an anti-civil war uprising on the afternoon of the 10th of this month due to their dislike of the civil war. They have entered the Eighth Route Army's garrison amidst the warm welcome of the military and civilians in the liberated area. The 13th and 15th Transportation Columns were shipped to Qingdao successively on July 2nd and 15th under the command of Chiang Kai-shek (each column had more than 1,000 men, all equipped with American weapons) to cooperate with the 54th Army of Chiang's army in invading westward along the Jiaoji Railway, controlling transportation, and attacking the liberated area.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Moscow Dispatch: A diplomatic correspondent for Izvestia wrote on the 11th, stating: The situation in China is increasingly worrying. The fratricidal civil war launched by the Chinese reactionaries continues to spread to new areas. Approximately one hundred divisions of troops have already been used in the war to attack the areas controlled by the Communist Party. In addition to the war, terrorist tactics are being used to deal with democratic organizations, democratic leaders, and newspapers that insist on stopping the civil war and firmly advocate the unity of the Chinese people. It is obvious that the Kuomintang reactionaries are using the ceasefire agreement and negotiations with representatives of the Communist Party to reorganize their military strength and prepare for larger-scale military operations. The mediation of General Marshall and the new US Ambassador to China, Stuart, has increasingly become a fantasy, because it is clear that no one can mediate peace with one hand while actively providing assistance to one party in the conflict with the other. Even as late as August 5th, Stuart and Admiral Cooke were still denying rumors that the United States intended to withdraw its troops stationed in China in the near future. However, in the words of Colonel Carlson, chairman of the National Committee for Peace, the presence of American troops in China, or rather, American interference in China's internal affairs, has become a major factor in fueling the resurgence of civil war by the ambitious reactionary groups within the Kuomintang. Recent developments have fully confirmed that Carlson's opinion is agreed upon by American democratic public opinion. In Anping and along the Pingjin Railway line, at the end of July, American troops found themselves standing on the side of the Kuomintang and involved in the civil war. The Chinese reactionaries, ignoring the interests of the people, are trying to lead the situation onto an extremely dangerous path. Foreign interference in China's internal affairs will only fuel the Chinese reactionaries' sinister conspiracies.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Moscow today broadcast: Pravda commented on the situation in China, stating: The Second World War has long ended, and European cities have forgotten the sound of air raid sirens, but in China, the Kuomintang is using American-made aircraft to bomb Yan'an, the location of the CCP Central Committee and the headquarters of the Eighteenth Group Army, a peaceful Chinese city, on August 2nd. The bombing of Yan'an is the best proof that the Kuomintang reactionaries are provoking civil war. According to information obtained, Zhou Enlai informed the US representative in China, Marshall, that the Kuomintang government had decided to launch an offensive from northern Jiangsu and Anhui towards Taierzhuang and other places. For this purpose, the Kuomintang government has dispatched six armies. In a situation where the scope of the civil war in China is expanding, the so-called mediation of the CCP-KMT negotiations by Marshall and Stuart is very strange. The American arbitrators are acting on the principle that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. Their left hand is mediating, while their right hand is arming Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, August 11th: Since forcibly occupying Anping Town, the Kuomintang side has been massively fabricating false evidence regarding the Anping Incident. The Kuomintang troops and special agent organs occupying the area have been conducting intense activities, intimidating and coercing local residents to testify to the various facts regarding the Anping Incident as alleged by the Kuomintang and the U.S. Navy. Although the Kuomintang side is doing its utmost to keep it secret, it still cannot conceal the traces of fabrication. Huang Rencai, Commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Region of Hebei Province of the Kuomintang, told an Yishibao reporter on the 7th: \"Sufficient evidence has been obtained to prove that the Anping Incident was an ambush set by the Communist army.\" Huang described his so-called experience of \"obtaining evidence\" in Anping Town, saying: \"The local residents initially seemed very frightened and did not explain the course of the battle. After the U.S. troops arrived, the National Army gathered, and senior officials came to the town, they were informed of the great righteousness, and finally told the situation at that time. The most prominent evidence at present is that the original owner of the ox cart blocking the road has been found, and there are signed documents in the villages in the area where the incident occurred.\" Based on the methods used by the Kuomintang warlords and special agent organs to rule the people and handle the Kunming Massacre, the Xiaguan Massacre, and other incidents, it is not difficult to understand the nature of these so-called \"evidences.\" Reliable sources confirm that the joint U.S.-Chiang military occupation of Anping Town and the repeated delays in the investigation time are precisely for the purpose of manufacturing these so-called \"evidences.\" After these \"evidences\" are fabricated, they suddenly change their attitude and demand immediate \"on-site investigation.\" Neutral observers believe that only by withdrawing the occupying forces of the U.S. and Chiang from Anping Town and completely restoring the area to its original state before July 29th can the on-site investigation have correct results. They also said that if the U.S. refuses to implement this only reasonable step, then people cannot but believe that the Anping Incident contains inside information that is very unfavorable to the U.S. and Chiang.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军占据安平镇后  伪造证件血口喷人\n\n1946-08-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军占据安平镇后\n    伪造证件血口喷人\n    【新华社北平十一日电】国民党方面在武力占领安平镇以后，已大量伪造关于安平事件的假证据。占领该地的国民党军与国民党特务机关，已进行了猛烈活动，恐吓与强迫当地居民，证实国民党方面与美海军方面关于安平事件的各种事实。国民党方面虽然竭力保守秘密，但仍不能掩盖假造的形迹。国民党河北省第五区专员黄任材七日向益世报记者称：“已获得充足证据证明安平事件为共军设伏”。黄氏叙述其所谓在安平镇“获得证据”的经过说：“该地居民初似甚恐惧，对战事经过未有说明。俟美军开到，国军云集，大员莅临时，晓以大义，终于说出当时情况。目前之显著证据为拦路牛车已寻到原主，肇事地区各村已有签名之文件”。根据国民党军阀与特务机关统治人民以及处理昆明惨案、下关惨案等事件的方法，不难明了这些所谓“证据”的性质。可靠方面证实，美方与蒋方共同武力占领安平镇，并再三拖延调查时间，正是为了制造这些所谓“证据”。而在这些“证据”造好以后，他们就突然改变态度，要求立即实行所谓“实地调查”。中立的观察家认为只有从安平镇撤退美蒋两方的占领军，完全恢复该地在七月廿九日以前的原状，实地调查才能有其正确的结果。并称，美方如果拒绝实行这个唯一合理的步骤，那么人们就不能不相信安平事件包含着对于美方与蒋方十分不利的内幕。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th—This reporter has reliably learned that from February 1944 to the end of 1945, the army and people of the liberated areas successively rescued 118 Allied airmen, of whom, excluding one British and nineteen Indian, the rest were all Americans. Among those rescued were two field officers and seventy-one junior officers. The rescue locations included all liberated areas from Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning to South China. The most rescues were in the South China Liberated Area, with 28 people, followed by the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning area with 23 people, Central China with 22 people, and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan with 21 people. All of the above personnel were forced to land during combat or transport flights against Japan. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the army and people of the liberated areas, actively cooperating with the Allied forces, spared no effort to rescue these stranded personnel, even at great risk, especially near enemy-occupied areas, and even made the greatest sacrifices to rescue an Allied pilot. After being rescued, these Allied airmen received all kinds of preferential treatment and assistance from the army and people of the liberated areas, and every effort was made to send them back to their original units or their national organizations in China, overcoming various difficult conditions. When passing through Japanese-occupied areas, troops were dispatched to escort them to protect their safety. For example, on February 2, 1945, the army and people of the Eastern Hebei Liberated Area rescued Captain Axel Hamble, pilot of the 854th aircraft of the 20th Bomber Squadron, and ten others at Emei Mountain northeast of Pinggu (very close to Anping Town, where conflicts have occurred today due to U.S. military provocations). Afterwards, they were escorted in two groups to Yan'an on April 17th and May 13th, respectively, and then transferred to the rear to rejoin their units. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: When the U.S. military in China today is actively assisting the Kuomintang reactionaries, and even directly participating in expanding the Chinese civil war and bombing the army and people of the liberated areas, it is very useful for us to recall the above facts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放区军民在抗日战争中  抢救美航空员百名  今天美军却以怨报德\n\n1946-08-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放区军民在抗日战争中\n    抢救美航空员百名\n    今天美军却以怨报德\n    【新华社延安十三日电】记者从可靠方面获悉：自四四年二月至四五年底，解放区各地军民曾先后救护盟国空军失事人员一一八人，其中除一名英籍和十九名印度籍外，余皆为美人。在上述被救人员中，包括两名校官及七一名尉官。获救地点包括自冀热辽至华南各解放区，其中最多者为华南解放区，救出二八名，次为冀热辽区救出二三名，华中二二名，晋冀鲁豫二一名。上述人员皆为对日作战或运输飞行中被迫降落。在抗日战争中，积极配合盟军作战之解放区军民，对这些失事人员皆不顾危险奋力抢救，特别是在接近敌人占领区甚至为救出一名盟国飞行员而付出最大牺牲。这些盟国空军人员于被救后，曾受到解放区军民之各种优待和帮助，并克服各种困难条件，设法将其全部送还原部或其本国在华机关。在通过日寇占领区时，为保护彼等之安全，皆派遣军队护送。如四五年二月二日，冀东解放区军民于平谷东北之峨眉山（距今日由于美军挑衅而发生冲突的安平镇甚近）救护廿轰炸机队八五四号机阿撤尔汉贝上尉等十一名，事后分两批于四月十七及五月十三日先后护送抵延安，转赴大后方归队。新华社记者评称：当今天在华美军积极援助国民党反动派，甚至直接参加扩大中国内战，轰炸解放区军民的时候，让我们回忆一下上述事实，是很有用处的。"

    "content": "Today's Taiwan\n    Huang @\n    Taiwan, which was ruled by Japan for 15 years, is now nominally \"victorious,\" but the people of Taiwan do not feel like victors at all; they feel they are conquered. What weighs on them is the double rule of the Kuomintang fascists and the Japanese invaders. Here, the so-called \"military-political integration\" is implemented, with an Administrative Governor's Office established, and Chen Yi as the Administrative Governor and concurrently the Garrison Commander, holding dictatorial power over administration, legislation, military affairs, finance, and banking. (Note that the vast majority of Taiwan residents are Chinese, with Japanese being the next largest group).\n    30,000 Japanese police and soldiers are being retained as much as possible. Taiwan's railways, telecommunications, and post offices, which have been taken over for more than half a year, are still managed by Japanese; banknotes are still issued by Japanese; letters are still sent using \"Greater Japanese Empire\" stamps. Not only are Japanese expatriates not being centrally managed, but they also control 80% of Taiwan's existing and important industrial and financial institutions. In fact, the Japanese are in a position of deputy rulers.\n    The Kuomintang authorities took over Taiwan in November last year. According to the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters, the Air Force First Group of the headquarters received eight units including the Japanese 8th Air Division, with only over 610,000 pieces of clothing and furniture, and not a single weapon. The Army Military Administration Group received five units including the Japanese Army Cargo Bureau and the Ordnance Supply Bureau, totaling 15 rifles and 19 sabers. Most of the munitions, including light and heavy weapons, ammunition, and provisions, were nowhere to be seen. It is said that when Japan announced its surrender, the local Japanese warlords moved many munitions and large quantities of light and heavy weapons to the deep mountains and hid them, and openly said to the compatriots in Taiwan that they would definitely come back. Many places where buried munitions were discovered by the common people, and they reported to the Garrison Headquarters, but the answer they received was, \"This concerns the takeover of enemy weapons, and this Headquarters is not in a position to intervene.\" When they reported to the Administrative Governor's Office, they said, \"This belongs to military affairs, and the Administrative Governor's Office cannot manage it.\"\n    In contrast to the privileged status of the Japanese, the people of Taiwan today are slaves trampled underfoot by the Kuomintang fascists. For example, at the end of May, the staff of the Industry and Mining Department of the Administrative Governor's Office, carrying guns, broke into the Daming Newspaper Office and ordered the newspaper to move out immediately! They punched and kicked Ai Lusheng, the publisher of the newspaper, and kidnapped him in a car. Another example is that on May 4th, the students in Jilong held their first \"May Fourth\" parade in their lives, but because they shouted slogans such as \"Oppose banquet politics!\" and \"Oppose corrupt politics!\", the parade was blocked midway. Many students and many Taiwanese people said, \"This is not as good as under the Japanese.\"\n    Since November of last year, all agencies have been scrambling to \"take over\" materials and houses, staging a \"housing grab war.\" Regardless of the size of the agency, \"taking over\" houses always involves several fixed steps: first, the agency office becomes staff dormitories, then the staff dormitories become \"private residences,\" and then the \"private residences\" become companies, firms, or restaurants and wine shops. For example, the \"Taiwan Fiber Products Distribution Co., Ltd.\" in Huashan Town, Taipei City, initially had seals from the agency under the Administrative Governor's Office, and later became a warehouse of the Taiwan Trade Bureau for a while, but by the beginning of May, it was building extensively and \"recruiting entertainers and actresses,\" turning into the \"Yashangyuan Restaurant.\" There are more than 100 such newly opened restaurants and dance halls in Taipei, all of which are bureaucratic capital converting public resources into private gains. The Kuomintang authorities established a \"Taiwan Trade Bureau\" in Taipei to implement full control over sugar, rice (Taiwan's two major products), coal, paper, fertilizer, camphor, and other important products, called \"provincial operation.\" It also retained the monopoly system on daily necessities such as tobacco, alcohol, salt, and flour, which was in place during Japanese rule. Apart from \"provincial operation\" and \"monopoly,\" the people have hardly any business to engage in, and the Trade Bureau buys at low prices and sells at high prices. In Shanghai, the sugarcane dumped by the Taiwan Sugar Company was forcibly purchased at a price of less than ten yuan in Taiwan and transported there. As a result, farmers were forced to reduce production and stop transporting grain, and coupled with the hoarding of large bureaucrats, it caused a rice shortage in Taiwan, and rice prices soared sixty to seventy times in a few months. A hungry 18-year-old girl in Kaohsiung secretly climbed into the warehouse of the 62nd Army and took some moldy rice, and was shot by the authorities.\n    All government offices, large and small, have private property. In addition to large factories and mines being nominally taken over by the factory department, other levels of government, such as the city government, county government, and even district offices, have small-scale factories and mines under their jurisdiction. For example, the Taipei County Government has more than 20 such properties. The officials of all levels of government control these properties, try their best to arrange private interests, engage in corruption, causing the factories to lose money and reduce production, and the money ends up in the pockets of private bureaucrats.\n    At first, the people of Taiwan held a warm hope, giving a thumbs-up and calling the \"takeover\" personnel \"old bigwigs,\" but now they call them \"pig brand goods\" (meaning hateful and killable pigs). When overseas civil servants in the takeover agencies say something wrong, they are often surrounded and beaten severely by local people on the street.\n    For months, the authorities' malpractice of appointing private individuals, treating Japanese invaders well, and excluding local people has continuously aroused resistance from local civil servants. The so-called \"personnel turmoil\" has spread throughout Taiwan. Students, the public, and the media are conducting anti-corruption and reactionary politics through marches and petitions. Taiwanese workers who do not earn enough to eat and wear have also launched a wave of strikes that has swept across the island.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 今日台湾\n黄＠\n1946-08-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　今日台湾\n    黄＠\n    被日本统治了十五年的台湾，现在名义上是“胜利”了，然而台湾的人民丝毫没有胜利者的感觉，他们感到自己是被征服者。压在头上的是国民党法西斯和日寇的双重统治。这里实行所谓“军政一元化”，设了一个行政长官公署，陈仪为行政长官兼警备司令，握行政、立法、军事、财政、金融、独裁权力。（按台湾居民除最大多数为中国人外，次多数就是日本人）。\n    三万日本警察宪兵仍被尽量留用。接收已半年以上的台湾铁路、电讯、邮政，仍由日人管理，钞票仍由日人发行，寄信仍用“大日本帝国”邮票，日侨不但没有集中管理，反而掌握现有台湾百分之八十和重要产业金融机构。日本人事实上是处于副统治者地位。\n    国民党当局接收台湾是在去年十一月间，据台湾警备司令部公布，该司令部空军第一组，接收日方第八飞行师团等八个单位，只有被服、家具六十一万余件，没有一件武器。又陆军军政组接收日陆军贷物局、兵器补给局等五个单位，共计步枪十五支、军刀十九把，大部军火包括轻重武器、弹药、粮食、被服等都不见影子。据说当日本宣布投降时，当地日本军阀，把许多军火和大量轻重武器之类，都搬到深山里藏起来，并公然对台湾的同胞说他们一定要重来。这里有很多地方埋藏的军火被老百姓发现了，他们去报告警备司令部，但所得到的回答是“事关接收敌军武器，本部未便过问”。再报告长官公署，又说：“这是属于军事方面的，长官公署管不了。”\n    与日本人的特权地位相反，今天台湾的人民是国民党法西斯派踏在脚下的奴隶，譬如在五月底，长官公署工矿处的职员，拿着枪闯进大明报社，命令该社立刻搬走！并将该社发行人艾璐生拳打脚踢，抓上汽车绑架而去。又如五月四日基降学生做了有生以来第一次“五四”游行，因为叫出了“反对宴会政治！”“反对贪污政治”的口号，游行中途被阻。许多学生和许多台湾人民说：“这还不如日本。”\n    自去年十一月以来，各机关都是争先恐后“接收”物资和房子，大演“房屋争夺战”，不论大小机关，“接收”房屋总有几个固定的步骤：首先由机关办公处变为职员宿舍，由职员宿舍变为“私人公馆”，再由“私人公馆”变为公司、行号或菜馆酒楼。例如台北市桦山町的“台湾纤维制品配给株式会社”起初贴着长官公署所属机关的封条，后来一度成为台湾贸易局仓库，但到了五月初的时候，却大兴土木“征募艺人女伶”，变成“牙上洹酒家了”。台北这样新开张的酒馆舞场有一百多家，都是化公为私的官僚资本。国民党当局在台北设立一个“台湾贸易局”，对于糖、米（台湾两大名产），煤、纸张、肥料、樟脑及其他重要出品物资，实行全盘统制，名曰“省营”。又保留日本统治时对烟、酒、盐、面粉等日用必需品的专卖制度，除了“省营”与“专卖”，人民几无业可营，贸易局低价买进高价卖出。在上海，台湾糖业公司所抛售的庶糖，是在台湾用十元以下的价格强迫收买而运去的。结果迫使农民减产，停运粮食，再加上大官僚的囤积，造成了台湾的米荒，米价在几个月中间暴涨了六七十倍。高雄一个十八岁饥饿的少女，偷偷地爬进了六十二军的仓库拿了些发霉的米，被当局枪毙。\n    大小衙门都有私产，除大的厂矿名义上由工厂处接收外，其他各级政府如市政府、县政府，甚至区公署都辖有小规模的工厂和矿产。如台北县政府就有这样的产业二十余处。各级政府的官长把持住这些产业，尽量安插私人，营私舞弊，使工厂亏本减产，钱都到了官僚私人的腰包。\n    台湾人民在当初抱着一股热望，翘起大拇指称：“接收”人员为“老大员”，而现在却叫“猪标货”了（意思叫可恶可杀的猪猡）。接收机关中的外来公务员，一句话不对，常在街上被本地人围起来痛打。\n    当局任用私人，厚待日寇，和排斥本地人的倒行逆施，数月来不断引起本地公务员的抗争，所谓“人事风潮”弥漫台湾全岛。学生、民众、舆论界以游行、请愿等方式进行反对贪污反动的政治。所得不够吃穿的台湾工人，也掀起了弥漫全岛的罢工潮。"

    "date": "1946-08-17",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Our correspondent interviewed the renowned legal scholar Professor He Sijing about the Anping Incident. Professor He stated: To understand the truth of the Anping Incident, one must know its background. In eastern Hebei, Kuomintang-controlled areas and liberated areas were intertwined. Most areas along the Beining Railway were liberated areas, and many places along the Tianjin-Beijing Highway (such as the hundred-mile area between Wuqing and Tongxian) also passed through liberated areas. The Kuomintang authorities tried their best to keep American troops embroiled in the war to attack the liberated areas, and U.S. Marine Corps officers have always lacked respect for China's territorial sovereignty and the concept of respecting the liberated areas. For example, in Liushouying, Changli, Qinhuangdao, and other places along the Beining Railway, the U.S. Marine Corps entered the liberated areas continuously from July 1st to 17th, resulting in as many as five conflicts. In these incidents, the U.S. military, armed and without prior notification, directly entered the liberated areas, even opening fire and killing local farmers. In the eyes of the U.S. military, these actions seemed to be their due right. This reveals an abnormal mentality on the part of the U.S. military, which is not treating China as an independent country on an equal footing with the United States, but rather regarding China as a colony. Precisely because of this mentality, actions that clearly violate the sovereignty of another country according to international law and the laws of any country are considered nothing by the U.S. military. Precisely because of this mentality, the U.S. military freely enters the liberated areas for military activities, and U.S. troops arbitrarily beat people and kill people with jeeps in major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, all of which are considered nothing. And when the Chinese people slightly carry out legitimate self-defense, the U.S. military believes it is an attack on them and feels very unhappy. The Anping Incident is another concrete manifestation of this abnormal mentality. But they should put themselves in the shoes of the Chinese people. If similar situations occurred in the United States, and foreign troops could move freely in American territory like the U.S. troops stationed in China today, then what would the American people do? If the American people would definitely rise up in self-defense, then how can it be imagined that the people in the liberated areas, who have a high degree of national self-esteem after eight years of national anti-Japanese war, can bow their heads and allow foreigners to trample on China's sovereignty? The U.S. Marine Corps patrol, fully armed, without U.S. military markings, and without prior notification to the liberated area authorities, suddenly entered the liberated area and opened fire. In this situation, how could the Eighth Route Army not rise up in self-defense? The Kuomintang authorities have always treated the bloody cases of U.S. troops killing compatriots in major cities within their control as nothing. After the Anping Incident, the Kuomintang authorities offered condolences and mourning to the dead and wounded U.S. soldiers with meticulous care, even to the point that the Americans themselves felt somewhat strange. However, for the military and civilians who died and were injured in defending national sovereignty, they not only did not provide compensation but also cursed them as \"bandits.\" After the Anping Incident, the Kuomintang authorities defended the U.S. side even more vigorously than the U.S. military themselves. These Chinese are more American than the Americans, just as some Americans are more Chinese than the Chinese. The Kuomintang government's position has further fueled the U.S. side's abnormal mentality of disregarding China's sovereignty and not treating the Chinese as equals.\n\nThe Kuomintang government calls itself the \"National Government,\" but it only protects foreigners and does not protect Chinese people. Tolerating foreign troops to trample on the sovereignty of the motherland is, in legal terms, a \"crime of treason\" and also a \"crime of endangering the state.\"\n\nProfessor He also stated: The Military Mediation Department has now sent a special team to investigate the Anping Incident. We hope to ascertain the truth and obtain a fair and reasonable resolution. However, unfortunately, during the investigation process, the Kuomintang side still insisted on a policy of expanding the situation, and the U.S. side did not cautiously remove its own biases because it was a party to the incident, thus making the investigation difficult. The investigation procedure proposed by the Chinese Communist side can be described as fair in terms of law, reason, and human feelings, but it was ultimately rejected. At the same time, while the three parties were discussing, the U.S. military and the Kuomintang army occupied the scene of the incident, which, in legal terms, is equivalent to destroying evidence. Especially interesting is that the U.S. side, on the one hand, denies jointly attacking the liberated areas with the Kuomintang army, but on the other hand, sends troops to occupy Anping Town, which belongs to the liberated area. This proves that the U.S. side has completely lost its neutral position in this incident and has entered a state of combat together with the Kuomintang army.\n\nProfessor He concluded: As long as the U.S. side abandons the abnormal mentality of treating China as a colony and treats the Chinese people as people who have national self-esteem like the American people; as long as the Kuomintang authorities demonstrate a minimum of national stance, the Anping Incident should be resolved appropriately and reasonably.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Beiping Dispatch: The Kuomintang side's Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Executive Department, Cai Wenzhi's, remarks on the Anping Incident, in addition to lacking any national stance and comparing China to Vietnam, also fabricated extremely absurd accounts of the incident itself. This can be proven from the materials published in the Tianjin Min Guo Daily. Regarding the location of the conflict, Cai stated that the vicinity of Anping Town was not a liberated area but a \"Communist army sneaking into\" the highway area to \"attack the U.S. military.\" However, the Min Guo Daily on August 1st stated that \"the incident location is within the jurisdiction of Yang Meisheng, commander of the Jin-Ji Column of the Communist army.\" In fact, the hundred-mile highway from Tongzhou to Wuqing has been liberated by the Eighth Route Army since the surrender of the Japanese invaders. Cai also claimed that the Communist army sneaked into the highway area, setting up obstacles and ambushes in advance, which was clearly premeditated. But the Min Guo Daily said: \"The U.S. military was traveling in heavy trucks, with a jeep in the lead, driven by a Chinese driver, far from the U.S. military's heavy trucks. The jeep drove to Anping, where about 300 Communist soldiers suspected it was a National army and \"immediately forced the vehicle to stop,\" pushing the vehicle away. At this time, the U.S. cars had already arrived and fired at the Communist soldiers, and the conflict began.\" It can be seen that it was not \"the Communist army premeditatedly ambushing the U.S. military,\" but that the U.S. military fired first when detaining a jeep of unknown origin that had illegally entered the liberated area. Even more ridiculous is that Cai Wenzhi attempted to prove that \"there were no National army troops in the Anping Incident\" by claiming that \"the U.S. military suffered so many casualties, while the National army suffered no casualties.\" However, according to the Min Guo Daily published on July 31st, the director of the Beiping Executive Office, Shi Chaoru, stated that the 11th War Zone Command did not send troops there, but only \"local troops\" assisted the U.S. military. This is the evidence that Chiang's army jointly attacked the Eighth Route Army's defense area with the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 何思敬教授谈安平事件  美军把中国看作殖民地国民党政府犯了叛国罪\n\n1946-08-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　何思敬教授谈安平事件\n    美军把中国看作殖民地国民党政府犯了叛国罪\n    【新华社延安十二日电】本社记者为安平事件走访名法学家何思敬教授，何教授称：要了解安平事件的真相，就必须知道这一事实的背景。在冀东，国民党统治区和解放区犬牙相错，北宁路两旁大多是解放区，而平津公路也有许多地方（如武清、通县间百余里地区）通过解放区。国民党当局尽力设法把美军留在进攻解放区之战事漩涡中，而美海军陆战队的官员们也素来缺乏尊重中国领土主权与尊重解放区的观念。例如北宁路沿线留守营、昌黎、秦皇岛等地，美海军陆战队于七月一日至十七日曾连续进入解放区，以致发生冲突共达五次之多，在这些事件中，美军带着武装，事前毫不通知迳目进入解放区，以至开枪射击，杀害当地农民。在美军看来，这些行动似乎都是他们应有的权利。这就透露了在美军方面存在着一种不正常的心理，就是不把中国当成一个和美国处于平等地位的独立国家，也就是说把中国看作殖民地。正由于这种心理，按照国际公法和任何国家的法律，明明是侵犯别国主权的行为，在美军看来都不算什么一回事。正由于这种心理，美军自由进入解放区军事，美军在国民党统治区各大城市随意殴人，开吉普车撞死人，都不算什么一回事。而当中国人稍稍进行正当的自卫时，美军就认为是对他们的攻击，而会觉到非常的不痛快。安平事件也就是这种不正常心理的又一具体表现。但是他们应当设身处地想一想，如果在美国也发生类似的情况，外国军队可以像今天驻华美军一样在美国领地自由行动，那么美国人民将怎样办呢？如果美国人民一定要起来自卫，那末怎么能设想经过八年民族抗日战争有高度民族自尊心的解放区人民能够俯首贴耳令外人蹂躏中国的主权呢？美海军陆战队的巡逻队，全副武装，没有美国兵的标记，事前并未通知解放区当局，突然进入解放区，且开枪射击，在这样情况下，八路军怎么能够不起而自卫呢？国民党当局对于其统治区内各大城市美军杀害同胞的血案，一向不当作一回事。在安平事件发生后，国民党当局对于死伤美军慰问哀悼，无微不至，甚至使美人方面也觉得有些奇怪。但是对于为了保卫国家主权而死伤的军民则不仅不加抚恤，而且咒骂为“匪”。安平事件后，国民党当局为美方辩解，甚至比美军自己还要起劲。这些中国人比美国人还要美国化，正如有些美国人比中国人还要中国化一样。国民党政府这种立场，分外助长了美方蔑视中国主权，不以平等对待中国人的不正常心理。\n    国民党政府自称是“国民政府”，但是他只保护外国人，不保护中国人。纵容外国军队蹂躏祖国主权，在法律上说来这是一种“叛国罪”，同时也是一种“外患罪”。\n    何教授又称：现在军调部已派特别小组调查安平事件，我们希望能判明事实真相，得到公平合理的解决。但是，不幸得很，在调查过程中，国民党方面仍坚持扩大事态的方针，美方也未因自己是这一事件的当事人而谨慎地免除自己的偏见，因而使调查发生困难。中共方面所提的调查程序，按诸法理人情，可称公允，但卒被拒绝。同时，正在三方商谈之际，美军和国民党军进占了出事地点，在法律上说，等于毁灭证据。尤其有趣的，美方一方面否认与国民党军联合进攻解放区，但另方面却派兵占领属于解放区之安平镇。这证明美方在这事件中完全丧失了中立地位，而与国民党军一起进入了作战状态。\n    何教授最后称：只要美方放弃以殖民地对待中国的不正常心理，而把中国人民看作和美国人民一样有民族自尊心的人民；只要国民党当局拿出最低限度的民族立场；安平事件应当得到适当合理的解决。\n    【新华社延安十二日电】北平讯：军调执行部国民党方面参谋长蔡文治关于安平事件的谈话，除毫无民族立场把中国以越南自比外，对于该事件本身经过也极尽荒谬之捏构，这点仅从天津民国日报所载之材料中即可证明。关于冲突发生地点问题，蔡谓安平镇附近并非解放区而系“共军潜入”公路区，“袭击美军”。但民国日报八月一日所载是“出事地点为共军晋冀纵队司令杨梅生辖区”。而事实上通州至武清之百余里公路，从日寇投降后即为八路军所解放了的。蔡又称共军潜入公路区，事先设置障碍，布置伏兵，显系预谋。但民国日报却说：“美军系乘载重汽车，先头为一吉普车，系一中国司机，距美部队之载重汽车尚远，该吉普车行至安平，有共军约三百余人疑系国军，“当即迫令该车停驶”，将该车推走，是时美国汽车业已开到，乃枪击共军，至是双方开始冲突。”可见不是“共军预谋伏击美军”，而是在扣留不明来历非法闯入解放区的吉普车时美军先行开火。更可笑的，是蔡文治企图以“美军伤亡如是之多，而国军并无伤亡”来证明“安平事件中没有国军”，但据上月三十一日民国日报刊载北平行营办事处处长石朝如称：十一战区长官部并未派兵前往，只“当地部队”协助美军而已。这就是蒋军联合美海军陆战队联合进犯八路军防地的证据。"

    "content": "The Anniversary of Japan's Surrender\n　　*Liberation Daily* Editorial\n\n　　August 15th of last year marked the day of Japan's surrender, proclaiming the victorious conclusion of the Chinese people's eight-year War of Resistance and the world's anti-fascist war. The victory over Japan was primarily achieved by the Chinese people, who endured the longest period of aggression, suffered the greatest harm, and made the most sacrifices, paying an immeasurable price. After winning the war, the Chinese people rightfully deserve an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China. Similarly, after the Japanese fascists were defeated, the Japanese people should have turned to building a peaceful and democratic New Japan. Only in this way could the soldiers and people who shed blood in this war receive their due recompense.\n\n　　However, the situation in China and Japan over the past year tells us the opposite:\n\n　　The Chinese fascist reactionaries, led by Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the aid of American reactionaries and Japanese warlords in China, are using civil war to usurp the fruits of the people's victory. For the sake of their own feudal comprador bureaucratic capital interests, they want to wage a civil war against the Chinese people and continue fascist dictatorship. Chiang Kai-shek and his group of feudal comprador bureaucratic capitalists are naturally extremely isolated in the face of the people, and their power is extremely fragile. They know that they cannot do evil to the Chinese people solely by relying on their own strength, and that they cannot wage war against the people at all. Therefore, they are offering up all of China's sovereignty to obtain armed and financial assistance from American reactionaries. Not only that, but for the bloody purpose of this dictatorial civil war, Chiang Kai-shek openly dares to issue the absurd order to \"love the enemy\" to the Japanese imperialists who fought the Chinese people for eight years. Okamura Neiji, the chief culprit in the invasion of China, is still in Nanjing as an honored guest because of his meritorious service in assisting Chiang. The Chiang Kai-shek fascist government remains silent regarding the preservation of strength and the preparation for a resurgence of Japanese reactionaries, and in fact, they hope for it. They did not say a word about the atrocities of Japanese bandits who shot and killed Taiwanese compatriots, they allowed the transport of phosphate ore from Jinping, Jinzhou to Japan, and they even surrendered fishing rights in China's territorial waters to Japan. The facts force the people to ask, is China the victor or is Japan the victor? These reactionary and dangerous facts show us clearly that under the rule of the most shameful Chiang Kai-shek fascist government, the old national humiliations have not yet been washed away, and new national humiliations have arrived.\n\n　　In Japan, the \"control\" of the American reactionaries has meant that the Japanese fascists and militarist forces have not suffered a crushing blow. A large number of reactionary Japanese financial groups and war criminals still hold power in reality, either openly or covertly. Japan's democratic movement is still suppressed, and the Japanese people are still being kept down and not allowed to raise their heads. The Japanese fascist faction is using the imperialist goals of the American reactionaries and their reactionary policies toward Japan as cover, gradually reorganizing its position, preparing to rise from the ashes and make a comeback. Therefore, although Japanese territory is occupied today, the resurgence of these Japanese fascists, who invaded China and disrupted the peace of the Far East, has become an obvious threat.\n\n　　We must especially point out that the Chinese fascist faction and the Japanese fascist faction are spiritually interconnected and are in fact colluding with each other. Belligerence is their common characteristic, and they both place their hopes on a third world war. They hope to quickly provoke new wars and \"turn the tables\" in the war. We must also especially point out that the existence of the Chinese fascist faction and the Japanese fascist faction today is mainly due to the connivance, protection, and assistance of the American reactionaries. In order to achieve their own imperialist goals, the American reactionaries are retaining, maintaining, and even assisting these two anti-democratic forces in the Far East, attempting to make this land a breeding ground for Eastern fascism. This policy of the American reactionaries not only endangers the Chinese people, but also endangers the American people themselves.\n\n　　On the anniversary of Japan's surrender, we must arouse the serious vigilance of the Chinese people and all peace-loving and democratic people in the world regarding the current situation in the Far East! After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people must obtain independence, they must obtain peace, and they must obtain democracy! The Chinese people must become the masters of China, and Japan should become a democratic country, a country where the fascist faction cannot rise again. Without an independent, peaceful, and democratic China and a democratic Japan, and allowing the Chinese fascist faction to persist in dictatorship and civil war, and allowing the Japanese fascist faction to survive in various forms, then a new war in the Far East will be inevitable.\n\n　　On the anniversary of Japan's surrender, when the Chinese people celebrate the victory of their own strength, they must not be overwhelmed, but must be fully vigilant, unite more closely, and continue to fight unyieldingly for independence, peace, and democracy! Resolutely oppose selling out the country, oppose civil war, and oppose dictatorship! At the same time, pay attention to the great danger of the resurgence of Japanese fascists under the connivance of American reactionaries! All the United Nations must implement peaceful and democratic cooperation, eliminate all imperialist conspiracies in the Far East and the world, and help the Japanese people obtain their own liberation!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日本投降一周年  解放日报社论\n\n1946-08-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日本投降一周年\n    解放日报社论\n    去年八月十五日，是日本投降的日子，中国人民的八年抗战和世界人民的反法西斯战争宣告了胜利的结局。对日战争的胜利，首先是被侵略时间最长、受害最大、牺牲最多的中国人民用无比的代价换得来的。中国人民在赢得战争之后，理应赢得一个独立、和平、民主的新中国。而日本人民在日本法西斯被击败之后，也应该转过身来建设一个和平民主的新日本。这样才能使这次战争中流了血的战士与人民得到应有的报酬。\n    但是这一年来中国和日本的形势却告诉了我们相反的事实：\n    以蒋介石为首的中国法西斯反动派依靠着美国反动派和日本在华军阀的援助，用内战的方法去篡夺人民的胜利果实。他们为着自己封建买办官僚资本的利益，要对中国人民实行内战，继续法西斯的独裁。蒋介石这批封建买办官僚资本家在人民面前自然是绝端孤立，他们的力量是极其脆弱的。他们知道仅仅依靠自己的力量便不可能在中国人民头上作恶，便完全不可能对人民作战。因此他们以献出中国一切主权来取得美国反动派武装和金钱的援助。不仅如此，为着这个独裁内战的血腥目的，蒋介石公然敢于向那和中国人民血战了八年的日本帝国主义发出“爱敌人”的荒谬指令。侵略中国的主犯岗村宁次，就因为援蒋有功至今仍在南京作着上宾。对于日本反动派的在国内保存力量重振旗鼓准备再起，蒋介石法西斯政府表示缄默，而实际是他们希望的。对于日寇枪杀台胞的暴行，他们默不一言，他们允许把锦州海屏的磷矿输送日本，还把中国领海的捕鱼权断送与日本。事实使人民要发出问题，究竟中国是战胜国呢还是日本是战胜国呢？这些反动和危险的事实，向我们显示得明明白白了，中国在最可耻辱的蒋介石法西斯政府统治之下，旧的国耻还没有洗干净，又来了新的国耻。\n    在日本，美国反动派的“管制”，使得日本法西斯及军国主义势力没有遭到粉碎的打击，日本的反动财阀大批战犯至今仍然或以公开的形式或以隐蔽的形式在实际上掌握大权。日本的民主运动仍然受到压迫，日本人民仍然被压着不让抬起头来。日本法西斯派正在利用美国反动派的帝国主义目的及其对日的反动政策作为掩护，步步重整阵地，准备死灰复燃，卷土重来。所以，今天虽然日本的土地被占领了，但是这侵略中国与扰乱远东和平的日本法西斯的再起又成为明显的威胁。\n    我们特别要指出，中国的法西斯派与日本法西斯派在精神上是互相沟通的，在事实上是互相勾搭的。好战是他们共同的特性，他们都把希望寄托在第三次世界大战，他们希望很快的挑起新的战火，而在战争中得到“翻身”。我们又特别要指出的，今日中国法西斯派与日本法西斯派的存在，主要关键是由于美国反动派的纵容包庇与援助的结果。美国反动派为了远到自己帝国主义的目的，他们在远东保留维护以至援助这两个反民主的势力，企图使这一片土地成为东方法西斯的温床。美国反动派的这个政策不但危害着中国人民，而且危害着美国人民自身。\n    在日寇投降一周年的时候，我们不能不唤起中国人民与世界一切爱好和平民主人士对于远东当前局面的严重警惕！中国人民在对日抗战之后，必须要得到独立，必须要得到和平，必须要得到民主！中国人民必须成为中国的主人，而日本应该成为民主的国家，成为法西斯派不能再起的国家。如果没有一个独立和平民主的中国和一个民主的日本，而任令中国法西斯派坚持独裁与内战，任令日本法西斯派在各种形式中保存下来，那末远东新的大战，将是不可避免的。\n    中国人民在日本投降一周年，庆祝自身力量胜利的时候，必须不冲昏头脑，而要有充分的警惕性，更加团结起来，不屈不挠地继续为独立和平民主而斗争！坚决反对卖国，反对内战，反对独裁！同时注视日本法西斯在美国反动派纵容之下再起的极大危险性！一切联合国必须实行和平民主的合作，消灭在远东与全世界一切的帝国主义阴谋，并且援助日本人民获得自己的解放！"

    "content": "After the eleven landlords and usurers in Tianshuiling, Jincheng were liquidated, they all returned the land to the peasants according to law, but they still retained the conditions necessary for life. Of the original ninety-three poor peasant households, six rose to become rich peasants, six rose to become well-to-do middle peasants, and seventy-seven rose to become middle peasants. Only four households remained unchanged. Two hired laborers rose to become middle peasants.\n\n　　The lives of the masses gradually improved. The days of \"pillowing bricks, drying bodies, and sleeping bent over the fire\" are gone forever. Now all the masses in the village wear new or semi-new clothes, and everyone has shoes to wear (in the past, many peasants had no shoes to wear, such as Guo Gelian, who often carried loads barefooted). The whole village no longer eats chaff (in the past, half of the year was spent eating chaff and vegetables). Especially during the spring plowing, all the labor force of the 132 households in the whole village were organized to carry out mutual aid. After the wheat harvest, each household harvested from 1.5 to 15 shi of wheat, and everyone had enough to eat and wear. Their ideological emotions also changed. Therefore, it became a symbol of a new type of village in the liberated area.\n\n　　Before the wheat harvest, Comrade Zheng Siyuan of the Jincheng County Party Committee came to Tianshuiling and chatted with Guo Gelian, a hero of the emancipation. Comrade Siyuan asked, \"Have you been thoroughly emancipated?\" Guo replied, \"I'm overflowing with emancipation!\" (meaning completely turned over). Then he humorously cited the fact of \"giving birth to a stone monkey at the age of fifty\" to explain the reason why he was \"overflowing with emancipation.\" He said with a smile: \"I am fifty-one years old this year, and my wife is also fifty-one years old. We haven't had a child for many years, but this year we had a son. Isn't this 'giving birth to a stone monkey at the age of fifty'?\"\n\n　　Amidst everyone's laughter, Ge Lian suddenly asked seriously:\n\n　　\"Whose child do you say this is?\"\n\n　　Everyone naturally answered in unison: \"Your own.\" Ge Lian disagreed. He solemnly said, \"It's Chairman Mao's.\" His reason was: \"Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I would have starved to death last year, so how could I have a son?\" Ge Lian laughed and said, \"Chairman Mao has taken root in Tianshuiling, so my son's nickname is called Zha Gen (Rooted).\"\n\n　　Then, Kong You's mother (the old lady who used a hoe to dig a hole to bury the landlord's shoes at the Dou Zheng Tongtai meeting) invited Comrade Siyuan to her home, brought out a bowl of vermicelli and a bowl of fried dough pieces, and asked her long-awaited guest to eat, saying: \"This bowl of vermicelli is nothing! But it is what I dried after worshipping my ancestors during the Qingming Festival and kept until now when there is nothing to eat.\" Indeed, \"a small gift conveys great affection.\" This bowl of home-cooked vegetarian dish—vermicelli—expresses a supreme and intimate emotion, reflecting the flesh-and-blood connection between the Communist Party and the people. The old lady was obviously overly excited about the arrival of her guest and asked like a child: \"Can I sing you a song?\" So an old lady nearly sixty years old danced and sang:\n\n　　The autumn wind blows, the weather is getting cold, thinking of winter makes my heart break, landlords wear fur coats and sit by the fire, poor people wear rags and face the sun.\n\n　　When noon passes, my heart is in a mess, thinking of eating is really difficult, landlords eat endless sesame oil and white flour, poor people drink half a bowl of vegetable soup until it's dry.\n\n　　The sun sets in the west, it's getting late, thinking of sleeping is really difficult, landlords have two quilts, one mattress, and one felt, poor people spread a mat and a thin sheet.\n\n　　When the rooster crows, it's dawn, I have to move without washing my face, landlords bask their buttocks with their hands behind their backs, poor people are covered in sweat and their clothes are wet.\n\n　　Poor people are not poor because of fate, nor because their ancestors didn't accumulate merit, it's all because the landlords exploited us, we must unite and fight against them.\n\n　　The Communist Party's proposal is really good, reducing rent and clearing debts has saved us, the lives of peasants have greatly improved, Chairman Mao calls for great production.\n\n　　The old lady finished singing this self-made folk tune in one breath. A cadre asked, \"The song is good, but the last sentence of the fifth paragraph is not in rhyme. Can I change the last two words 'struggle'?\" The old lady immediately protested: \"Don't you dare change it! How can you turn over without struggle?\"\n\n　　This is exactly what everyone said: \"In the liberated areas, there are only old people, but no withered hearts!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 朱襄：快乐的心  群众翻身后\n\n1946-08-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　朱襄：\n    快乐的心\n    群众翻身后\n    晋城天水岭十一户地主及高利贷者被清算以后，都依法退出了农民的土地，但都还保有生活所必须的条件。原九十三户贫农中，六户上升为富农，六户上升为富裕中农，七十七户上升为中农，只四户未动。二户雇工均上升为中农。\n    群众生活逐渐改善，过去“枕砖头、晾身体、弯火睡”的日子，已一去不复返了。现全村群众都穿上新衣或半新衣，都有鞋穿（过去许多农民没鞋穿，如郭葛联经常赤脚“担山”），全村已没有吃糠的（过去是糠菜半年粮），尤其在春耕时，全村一百三十二户的所有劳力都组织起来实行互助。麦收后，每户收麦一石五斗到十五石不等，大家都有吃有穿，思想情绪也起了变化。因之成为解放区新型村庄的标帜。\n    麦收前，晋城县委会郑思远同志到了天水岭，同翻身英雄郭葛联闲谈。思远同志问：“你身翻透了吗？”郭答：“翻涨了！”（翻过了的意思），接着他诙谐的举出“五十出头，生个石猴”的事实，来说明他“翻涨了”的缘由。他含笑的说：“我今年五十一岁了，我老婆也五十一岁了，好多年没生姓，偏偏今年就生了个儿，这不是‘五十出头生个石猴吗？’”\n    在大家欢笑声中，葛联忽然严肃的问：\n    “你说这个儿是谁的？”\n    大家自然一致的答：“你自己的。”葛联可不同意，他郑重的说：“是毛主席的。”他的理由是：“没有毛主席共产党，我去年早就饿死了，那里还会生儿？”葛联大笑起来说：“毛主席在天水岭扎根了，所以我这个儿的小名便唤扎根。”\n    接着孔友他娘（即斗争同泰会的大会上，用镢头刨窝埋地主鞋子的老太太），请思远同志到他家里，端出一碗粉条，一碗油炸面圪垛，请她盼望了好久的客人吃，并说：“这碗粉条不值什！但它是我清明祭祖后晒干放到现在没啥得吃的。”诚然，“礼轻仁义重”，这一碗家常素菜——粉条表达了一种无上的亲切的情感，体现了共产党与人民之间的骨肉般的联系。老太太显然为她客人的来临而过度的兴奋，孩子似的问：“我给你唱个歌好吗？”于是一个将近六十岁的老太太手舞足蹈的唱起来了：\n    秋风吹来天气凉，想起过冬愁断肠，地主们身穿皮袄火边坐，穷人们身挂破衣向太阳。\n    日过午时心中乱，想起吃饭实是困难，地主们香油白面吃不尽，穷人们半碗菜汤喝个干。\n    日落西山天晚了，想起睡觉实是困难，地主们两床被子一褥一毡，穷人们铺张席片一卧单。\n    鸡叫一声天明了，顾不得洗脸就要动弹，地主们背着两手晒屁股，穷人们满头大汗湿衣衫。\n    穷人们穷来不是命穷，也不是祖上没积功，都是地主们剥削了咱，咱要团结起来和他斗争。\n    共产党主张真正好，减租清债救活了咱，农民生活大改善，毛主席号召大生产。\n    老太太一口气唱完了这首农民自作小调，有个干部问：“这首歌好是好，就是第五段最后一句不抑韵，我将最后‘斗争’两个字改一下好么？”老太太马上提出了抗议：“可不敢改！不斗争还能翻身？”\n    这正合着大家所说的：“在解放区只有年老的人，却没有枯老的心！”"

Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 13th, announcing that the Soviet Union has formally requested Turkey to revise the Montreux Convention. The statement said: This action by the Soviet Union is based on the decision of the Three-Power Berlin Conference. The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey submitted a note to the Turkish government on the 13th, pointing out that the Montreux Convention failed to prevent German and its vassal ships from using the Black Sea Straits against the Allies during the war, and the Turkish government should be responsible for this. The Soviet government proposes to revise the Montreux Convention based on the following principles:\n\n　　(1) The Black Sea Straits should be open to the navigation of merchant ships of all countries. (2) The Black Sea Straits should be permanently open to the passage of warships of Black Sea countries. (3) Warships of non-Black Sea countries shall not be allowed to pass through the Straits except in special circumstances. (4) The system for managing the Black Sea Straits should belong to Turkey and other Black Sea countries. (5) Turkey and the Soviet Union are very concerned about and able to guarantee the safety and navigation of the Black Sea Straits, and they should jointly organize the defense of the Straits so that other Black Sea countries can use the Straits. The announcement concluded by saying that the Soviet Union has notified the British and American governments of this matter. The Turkish side has not yet responded to the Soviet note.\n\n　　Note: The Montreux Convention was signed on July 20, 1936, for a period of ten years, which expires this year. The signatory countries include ten countries: Britain, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Australia. Because the convention was signed in the Turkish city of Montreux, it is named the Montreux Convention. The main content of the treaty is to stipulate the methods for warships of Black Sea coastal countries and non-Black Sea coastal countries to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits under Turkish jurisdiction. Because the Montreux Conference was manipulated by reactionary elements of Britain and France, the convention has anti-Soviet characteristics, manifested in: (1) Limiting the tonnage of Soviet ships entering and leaving the straits during peacetime; (2) Allowing warships of non-Black Sea countries to pass through the straits and enter the Black Sea; (3) Pulling countries that have nothing to do with the import and export of the straits into the signatory countries of the convention; (4) Ships of countries that are hostile to Britain and France shall not be allowed to pass through the straits in the event of war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联根据柏林会议决定  要求修改蒙特娄公约  已向土耳其政府提出照会\n\n1946-08-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联根据柏林会议决定\n    要求修改蒙特娄公约       \n    已向土耳其政府提出照会\n    【新华社延安十四日电】莫斯科讯：苏联外交部于十三日发表公告，宣布苏联已正式向土耳其要求修改蒙特娄公约。公告内称：苏联这一行动是根据三强柏林会议的决定的。苏驻土大使已于十三日向土政府提出照会，指出战争中蒙特娄公约并未能阻止德国及其附庸的舰船利用黑海海峡以反对盟国，土政府对此应负责。苏联政府提议根据下列原则重新修改蒙特娄公约：\n    （１）黑海海峡应开放让各国商船航行。（２）黑海海峡经常开放让黑海各国军舰通行。（３）非黑海国的军舰除特殊情形外不准通过海峡。（４）管理黑海海峡制度应属于土耳其及其他黑海国的权利。（５）土耳其与苏联十分关心并且能够保证黑海海峡的安全与通航，他们应以共同力量组织海峡防卫，以使黑海其他国家利用海峡。公告末称：苏联已将此事通知英美政府。苏对土照会尚未得到土方答复。\n    按：蒙特娄公约签订于一九三六年七月二十日，期限为十年，今年期满，参加的签字国计有英、法、日、苏、土、保、希、南、罗、澳等十国。因公约签订于土耳其的蒙特娄城，故名为蒙特娄公约。该约的主要内容在于规定黑海沿岸与非黑海沿岸各国军舰通过土属达达尼尔与博斯普鲁斯两海峡的办法，由于蒙特娄会议为英法两国反动份子所操纵，因而该公约便具备了反苏的特点，表现在：（一）限制苏联平时出入海峡船只的吨数；（二）非黑海国家的军舰也通过海峡进入黑海；（三）把与海峡进出口毫无关系的国家也拉到公约签字国里来；（四）战争发生时与英法敌对的国家之舰船，不得通过海峡。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Paris dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered his fifth speech at the Paris Peace Conference yesterday, condemning certain major powers for attempting to gain a monopoly position in the Mediterranean and trying to push Germany and Italy behind. Molotov said that this method is not beneficial to lasting peace in Europe, and both Germany and Italy should feel their responsibility as Mediterranean countries. Molotov was the first speaker at the plenary session, which resumed at 10:00 am yesterday. The agenda of the plenary session was to continue the debate on Italian Prime Minister Gasperi's statement. Molotov stated: Gasperi's statement did not denounce Mussolini and Italian Fascism, and the current Italian government has not implemented a genuine democratic policy, and the task of eradicating the last vestiges of Fascism is far from complete. Molotov continued: Gasperi wants to find a \"reasonable\" excuse for Italy's demands, especially for the demands including Trieste and the Julian region. The Soviet Union refuses to recognize any attempt to seize foreign territory, for the benefit of the Italian people. This kind of attempt is only a symbol of the expansionist tendency of certain narrow-minded people, and the Soviet Union refuses to postpone the decision on the relevant Italian reparations issue for another year. Gasperi's request is intended to create some differences of opinion among the Allies. Molotov finally pointed out: The Soviet Union has tried to limit the excessive demands of foreign capital on Italy, so as not to undermine the Italian economy, and the result of those demands will make Italy an economic slave of foreign trusts and cartels. As for the Soviet Union's reasonable reparations demands on Italy, they must never be regarded as equivalent to the former. Southern representative Biade continued to speak, expressing that the Southern government would never accept any of the three proposals put forward by the United States, Britain, and France on the Trieste Autonomous Region, because these proposals cannot give the people of Trieste any autonomous government. And if the decrees of those proposals are included as the laws of the autonomous region, this is the greatest irony. Biade declared: The Soviet proposal, which is very different from the other three drafts, is the only democratic plan; the Southern government is willing to use the Soviet proposal as the basis for negotiations.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫洛托夫和会演说  抨击意总理声明  谴责某些大国垄断地中海企图\n\n1946-08-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　莫洛托夫和会演说\n    抨击意总理声明\n    谴责某些大国垄断地中海企图\n    【新华社延安十四日电】巴黎讯：苏外长莫洛托夫昨日在巴黎和会上发表第五次演说，谴责某些大国企图在地中海取得垄断的地位，并企图将德国和意大利推到后面去。莫洛托夫说这种方法对欧洲持久和平没有裨益，而德、意两国都应该感到自己作为地中海国家的责任。莫洛托夫是昨日上午十时续开的全会上第一个发言者。全会的日程是继续辩论意总理加斯贝利的声明。莫氏称：加氏的声明并没有痛斥墨索里尼与意大利法西斯主义，意大利现政府并没有实行真正的民主政策，根绝法西斯最后残余的任务远未完成。莫氏继称：加斯贝利想为意大利的要求，特别是对包括的里雅斯特与朱里亚区的要求找寻“合理”的借口。苏联拒绝承认任何想攫取外国领土的企图，是为了意人民的利益。这一类企图只是某些偏窄人士扩张趋向的象征，苏联拒绝将有关的意国赔款问题延迟一年再行决定的要求。加氏这种要求是想造成盟国间某些意见的分歧。莫洛托夫最后指出：苏联曾试图限制外国资本对意大利的过分要求，以免破坏意大利的经济，而那些要求的结果，将使意大利成为外国托辣斯与卡特尔的经济奴隶。至于苏联对意的合理赔款要求，则是绝不能与前者同等看待的。南代表彼亚德继续发言，表示南政府将绝不接受美英法对的里雅斯特自治区所提出之三个建议中的任何一个。因为这些建议不能给予的里雅斯特人民以任何自治政府。而如果把那些建议的法令包容做自治区的法律，这真是最大的讽刺。彼氏宣称：和其他三个草案差异极大的苏联草案，是唯一的民主方案；南政府愿以苏联建议案作为谈判的基础。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 14th: News reports: Chiang Kai-shek's faction is playing tricks with the Central Plains ceasefire agreement, continuing to attack Li Xiannian's troops, and refusing to allow General Li Xiannian's representatives to safely go to Xi'an for mediation. The Beiping Executive Headquarters issued a public statement, once again stipulating a ceasefire from the 6th, but as of the time of this dispatch, Chiang's troops are still continuing to attack the various breakout forces of Li Xiannian's troops. In southern Shaanxi, in addition to the original pursuing Chiang's troops, approximately five more divisions have been added, under the personal command of Hu Zongnan. In Zhushan, western Hubei, An Ruihe is organizing a new \"encirclement and suppression\" campaign in the Fangxian area; the main force of the 14th Army, originally responsible for guarding and transferred here, has also moved east to this area to implement blocking. In Taihu, southern Anhui, Chiang's troops have again launched a fierce offensive with four divisions since the 6th. According to Chiang's troops who have laid down their weapons, they are still under orders to annihilate the Communist army within a deadline. Zheng Jiemin, a government member of the Executive Headquarters, secretly ordered the armies not to be restricted by the agreement signed by the Ninth and Thirty-second Groups, otherwise the division and army commanders would be subject to military law. While Chiang's troops are attacking, the Chiang faction representatives of the Executive Headquarters' Ninth and Thirty-second Groups, who are negotiating the specific implementation of the ceasefire order in Xi'an, are also hindering the progress of the negotiations, repeatedly prohibiting Zhou Zijian, the representative formally entrusted by General Li Xiannian, from contacting the group. Although General Li has telegraphed the group agreeing to send representatives to Xi'an again, requesting the Chiang faction to guarantee their safety, the Chiang faction has consistently refused. The above facts show that the Chiang faction is systematically and practically overturning the ceasefire agreement, insisting on the goal of annihilating Li Xiannian's troops, and attempting to shift the responsibility for the conflict to the Communist army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋方玩弄停战协议  继续进攻李先念部\n\n1946-08-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋方玩弄停战协议\n    继续进攻李先念部\n    【新华社延安十四日电】军息：蒋方玩弄中原停战协议继续向李先念部进攻，并不许李先念将军的代表安全到西安进行调处工作。北平执行部发表公报，再一次的规定自六日起停战，但截至发电时止，蒋军仍再向李先念部各路突围部队继续进攻。陕南方面除原有追击蒋军外，新增加约五个师的兵力，由胡宗南亲自指挥。鄂西竹山方面，安瑞河正在房县一带组织新的“围剿”；原来担任警卫调来的十四军主力也已东开到这个地区实行堵击。皖南太湖方面，蒋军又有四个师的力于六日兵又开始猛烈进攻。据放下武器的蒋军人员说，他仍奉命限期歼灭中共军。执行部政府委员郑介民并密令各军勿为第九第三十二小组签订之协议限制，否则各师长军长就要受到军法处分。与蒋军进攻的同时，于西安谈判停战命令具体实施办法的执行部第九第三十二小组的蒋方代表也尽是阻扰谈判进行，再三禁阻李先念将军所正式委托的代表周子健与小组联络。李将军虽已向小组复电同意即再派代表赴西安，要求蒋方保障安全，蒋方亦始终拒绝。上述事实显示蒋方有计划的在实际上推翻停战协议，坚持歼灭李先念部的目的，并妄图将冲突责任加到中共军方面。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. Moscow Radio commentator Massinu, citing Chinese and foreign commentary on the current situation in China, pointed out that the Marshall-Stuart joint statement added fuel to the fire of the Chinese civil war and marked the beginning of the second stage of US armed intervention in China. Massinu stated: The Chinese civil war is rapidly spreading throughout the country. Chinese democrats have repeatedly pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries are the culprits behind the expansion of the civil war. They also emphasized that the CCP's resolute implementation of self-defense actually demonstrates its intention to strive for peace and make sufficient concessions. A broadcast from the New York radio station on August 11th pointed out the opinions of some well-informed sources in China that the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have reached a stalemate, which is the result of the Kuomintang's decision to use force to crush the Communists. However, Chinese democrats have pointed out that the targets of the Kuomintang reactionaries' offensive are not only the Communist Party, but also the implementation of terror tactics against all Chinese democrats, which is progressing simultaneously with the expansion of the civil war. Chinese democrats believe that the Marshall-Stuart joint statement that \"a complete cessation of military action throughout China is no longer possible\" has significant meaning. The role played by American peaceful mediation has not surprised Chinese democrats. Soong Ching Ling stated that \"American reactionaries and Chinese reactionaries cooperate and encourage each other.\" According to the opinion published by US Congressman Patterson in Congress on July 26th, the main method of this encouragement is the so-called \"mediation.\" The Kuomintang government used Marshall's mediation and the conclusion of a truce agreement to redeploy and replenish its forces, launching offensives against the Communist Party and democratic forces opposed to Chiang Kai-shek. Patterson stated: The so-called truce agreement was also used to strengthen and improve American assistance to the Nanjing government. He concluded: After gaining all the benefits during the truce, the Kuomintang army resumed its frantic civil war. Chinese democrats pointed out that, in this situation, the Marshall-Stuart joint statement not only continued to expose the US policy of interfering in China, but also encouraged the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch new offensives. Therefore, Chinese democrats pointed out the importance of the Kuomintang bombing Yan'an with American-made aircraft. In North China, conflicts occurred between Chinese and US Marines, and new military operations occurred in North and Central China immediately after the US State Department issued a statement that it would not change its China policy. Therefore, the Marshall-Stuart joint statement added fuel to the fire of the Chinese civil war.\n    Chinese democrats also summarized the domestic situation, saying: Since the Japanese surrender a year ago, the Chinese reactionaries immediately attempted to use force to resolve the issue of dictatorship or democracy, but encountered strong resistance from democratic forces. This is the real reason why the US Marines landed in North China last November. The first stage of American intervention in China began in this way. Chinese democrats pointed out that the Marshall-Stuart joint statement caused new and huge conflicts in North and Central China, proving that it was the beginning of the second stage of US armed intervention in China.\n    The Overseas Chinese Daily wrote: We must warn these war instigators with a saying once said by Sun Yat-sen: \"The armed forces created by the collusion between warlords and imperialism will surely fail!\" The newspaper continued: \"If the Kuomintang warlords insist on carrying out their evil conspiracy, then they will be wiped out by the huge force of the Chinese people, just like Chinese warlords such as Yuan Shikai, Duan Qirui, and Wu Peifu.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努指出  马歇尔、司徒雷登的联合声明，是美国武装干涉中国第二阶段的开始。\n\n1946-08-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努指出\n    马歇尔、司徒雷登的联合声明，是美国武装干涉中国第二阶段的开始。\n    【新华社延安十四日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努引证中外舆论对中国现状的评论，指出马歇尔与司徒雷登的联合声明，使中国内战火上加油，并且是美国武装干涉中国第二阶段的开始。马氏称：中国内战正在迅速普遍全国，中国民主人士再三指出国民党反动派是扩大内战的祸首，他们并着重指出中共坚决实行自卫，实际上表示力谋达成和平的意图，实行足够的让步。纽约无线电台八月十一日广播指出驻中国的某些消息灵通人士的意见，国共二党的谈判已陷僵局，这是国民党决定用武力粉碎共产党人的结果。但中国民主人士都指出国民党反动派进攻的对象不只是共产党，而且与扩大内战同时并进的是实行恐怖手段，反对中国全体民主分子。中国民主人士认为马歇尔与司徒雷登的“在中国全境完全停止军事行动已不可能”的联合声明有重大的意义，美国和平调解所起的作用并没有使中国民主人士发生惊异。宋庆龄声明说“美国反动派与中国反动派相互合作彼此鼓励”，据美国众议员柏德逊七月二十六日在国会公布的意见，此种鼓励的主要方法就是所谓“调停”。国民党政府利用马歇尔调停与缔结停战协定以便重新配置与补充自己的兵力，向共产党及反对蒋介石的民主力量，举行进攻。柏德逊称：所谓停战协定，还被利用加强改进美国对于南京政府的帮助。他结论称：在停战时期取得全部利益之后，国民党军队又重新开始疯狂的内战。中国民主人士指出，在这种情况下，马、司联合声明不仅是继续暴露了美国干涉中国的政策，而且是鼓励国民党反动派进行新的进攻。因此中国民主人士指出国民党用美制飞机轰炸延安的重要性。在华北，中国与美海军陆战队发生冲突，以及在美国务院发表不改变对华政策声明后，马上在华北华中发生新的军事行动。因此马、司联合声明对于中国内战是火上加油。\n    中国民主人士并总结国内局势说：从日本投降一年以来，中国反动派马上企图用武力解决专政或民主的问题，但是遇到了民主力量的强大反抗，这就是去年十一月美海军陆战队在华北登陆的真正原因，美国干涉中国的第一阶段就是这样开始的。中国民主人士指出马、司联合声明使华北与华中发生新的巨大冲突，证明是美国武装干涉中国第二阶段的开始。\n    华侨日报对此写道：我们必须警告这些战争挑拨者以孙中山曾说过的一句话：“军阀与帝国主义阴谋合作所造成的武装力量一定会失败的！”该报继称：“假使国民党军阀坚持实行自己罪恶的阴谋，那末它将会像袁世凯、段祺瑞，吴佩孚等中国军阀一样，会被中国人民的庞大力量铲除净尽。”"

    "content": "Antung on the Yalu River\n    Liu Baiyu\n    As a reporter, I entered the Antung area from Fushun and Benxi. The road from Fushun to Benxi is a difficult one for cars, but from Benxi, the Anfeng Railway is smooth, passing through the winding Motianling Mountains to the Yalu River. According to railway employees at the station, the democratic government is adding a branch line from Fengcheng north to Kuandian. The Japanese originally planned this road to reach Tonghua directly, but it was never built, and construction has now begun.\n    Antung City has developed along the riverbank. The river water is a deep green. I heard that when General Xiao Hua's soldiers first arrived here and saw the Yalu River, some were so excited that they jumped up and said, \"Chairman Mao said we would fight to the Yalu River!\" Yes, they really had reached the Yalu River.\n    There is an iron bridge over the river, and the other side is Sinuiju in North Korea. During the \"Manchukuo\" period, everything looted was transported via this bridge to Japan through Korea.\n    The central street leading directly to the railway station is neat and wide, named Mao Zedong Road. Further down are Yang Jingyu Road and Deng Tie Mei Road. The city center is a thriving commercial area. Several miles long, pedestrians throng shoulder to shoulder. Prices are remarkably low. A horse-drawn carriage ride from the south end to the north end of the city costs only five yuan. In Chongqing, a five-yuan bill is often discarded on the ground. Finance is stable. One yuan of Northeast Bank currency can be exchanged for two yuan of \"Manchukuo\" currency or twenty-six yuan of legal tender. Factories are all in operation. From the mountains, chimneys are seen everywhere. The cloth, cigarettes, and textiles in the shops in the suburbs are all produced by local factories.\n    Antung Province has a population of 3,444,000, with a cultivated area of over 20 million mu. There are 100,000 workers working in factories and mines.\n\n            Turning Over\n    From the day the democratic regime was established, Antung Province regained its life and freedom. They immediately began to retaliate against those who had slaughtered them. Tian Baoshou was a rickshaw puller who, to settle accounts with the bloodsucker Yin Changqiu of the rickshaw association, pulled his rickshaw during the day, noted down information he heard from others, and attended meetings in the evenings. Finally, he organized a large struggle meeting of more than 2,000 people at the Yongle Theater, where Yin Changqiu immediately spat out 140,000 yuan to compensate everyone for their losses.\n    In Yuanbao District, there was a Liu Weizhi, who was a squad leader (in charge of over 200 people below the street chief) during the puppet Manchukuo era. He relied on his son's influence in the county government to commit all kinds of evil deeds. No one mentioned him without hatred. Before, they dared to hate but not speak. Now, they could no longer be suppressed and rose up to settle accounts with him. They took this old cunning fox, whom no one dared to look at before, to the Jiuhecheng Factory to settle accounts. A poor man accused him of how he beat and cursed people when he recruited laborers in the past, and others accused him of collecting sacks for the puppet Manchukuo, which he had people buy with money, but then he kept them all for himself. Zhao Jinshan once spent 500 yuan to buy two houses and reported a change of residence to him. He said:\n    \"The reason for moving is not valid, and it will not be reported.\"\n    In those days, without reporting your household registration, you could not get food rations and would have to go hungry. Zhao Jinshan's wife went to beg for help and was cursed away. Later, after sending twenty catties of meat and some chickens, he finally said, \"Move in first and then investigate!\" But he also leaked the news that nine out of ten people moving were Eighth Route Army soldiers. Sure enough, within a month, he arrested Zhao Jinshan and sent him to be a laborer. Zhao's wife was pregnant, and Zhao knelt down and begged, but he snorted and said, \"You will die if you are told to die, no questions asked!\" Zhao had no choice but to spend 2,000 yuan to hire a laborer. A few days later, Liu Weizhi took away his ration coupons for food, and the family went hungry. The woman died of anger after giving birth to the child, and the child also died, leaving Zhao Jinshan with a seventeen-year-old girl and two children. The girl was soon abducted. In less than a month, Liu Weizhi forced him to carry the child to be a laborer. He went to the municipal government to request help but was cursed back. At this point, his family was ruined. After thinking it over, he could no longer bear it and started arguing with Liu Weizhi, who sent him to the coal mine as a \"vagrant\" (idler). Now Zhao Jinshan has returned. He stands there, ragged, dirty, and has lost his human form, but his eyes gleam with hatred. Even Liu Weizhi, who is as cunning as an old fox, changes color.\n    One accusation after another was made. Finally, someone revealed that after \"August 15th,\" taking advantage of the chaos, he pulled 20 logs of wood from the Hama Tang station, as well as 100 tons of coal, iron, and cement.\n    This great turning-over movement was a people's accusation and a people's execution. In Antung City, there were sixteen Japanese war criminals and six traitors. Throughout the province, 860,000 people participated in this turning-over movement to recover everything they had lost.\n\n            Democratic Life\n    On the second day of arriving in Antung, I visited Mr. Chen Xianshou, the newly elected Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, at the City Hall.\n    Mr. Chen is from Tonghua. He studied electrical engineering at Sendai Higher Technical School in Japan. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Three Eastern Provinces Radio Station and a member of the Jilin Provincial Kuomintang Party Department. He is still a leader of the Chongqing Democratic Political Advancement Association. He returned here not long ago after overcoming numerous difficulties.\n    At the same place, at noon, I met Mr. Zhang Dongmin, the Vice-Speaker. He is 76 years old, with white hair and a smiling face. He is an old member of the Tongmenghui. He was the leader of the military government during the uprising in Northeast China to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, he launched another uprising to oppose Yuan Shikai. During the Great Revolution, he was a member of the Liaoning Constitution Drafting Committee. After the Great Revolution, he gradually realized that the Kuomintang had moved towards darkness and corruption, so he abandoned politics to practice medicine and bury himself in running a hospital. Regarding the future of Northeast China, he advocated autonomy. He said, \"This is his old idea, and it does not violate national unity!\"\n    Other countries in the world also have autonomy. Delegation can be organized to come and see what it is like. What is being done well here should be copied.”\n    Another Vice-Speaker is Comrade Lin Yishan, the representative of the Communist Party of China in Antung Province. His right hand was crippled in the war. He is a shrewd, intelligent, and sincere person.\n    After this, I sat in the gallery of the Assembly for four or five days. When Liu Lanbo, the Vice-Chairman of the Provisional Democratic Government elected by the People's Representative Conference last winter, reported on the work of the government, he said, \"The people are the masters, and we are reporting the work situation to the masters.\" A heated discussion followed the report. Especially at the April 17th meeting when the election of provincial government members was held, I saw people from all walks of life, with their unique habits, styles, and postures, walking to the microphone. Some campaigned for themselves, and some campaigned for others. They were serious and earnest. I saw Mr. Gao Chongmin, this veteran democrat, say, \"I see that Vice-Chairman Liu sleeps less than five hours a day for his work. This is the virtue of the Communist Party. But I am really worried about him...\" He was so moved that he could not speak for a long time, and there was a burst of applause from the audience.\n    In this preparatory meeting of the Assembly, there was a Li Jinsheng who was a landlord. He originally kept to himself, but then he suddenly came out. His friends asked him why, and he said, \"I have a reason.\" He gave several reasons: Once, a group of Democratic Allied Forces came to the village without a place to live. They did not want to enter the village and disturb the people, so they lived in dilapidated houses outside the village. It was snowing, and there were no windows. They lived like this for two nights and then left. He said, \"China can have such an army!\" Secondly, he saw that the staff in the democratic government were closely united. At first, he thought they were all old friends, but later he learned that they came from all over the country, which surprised him. So he said, \"I cannot go against my conscience. The Communist Party is good, and I have to come out and work with them.\"\n    Since its liberation last August, Antung has, on the one hand, eliminated the remnants of the enemy and puppets, and on the other hand, convened a People's Representative Conference. At this conference, a provisional democratic government was elected. From then on, Antung embarked on a new path. People's opinion organs were established in all counties, and county administrative committee members and county heads were elected. People's elections were held from the village to the district, and the regime was transformed.\n    During the general election in Antung City, each street freely elected representatives, and then 350 people held a conference to elect councilors and the mayor. It was very lively. Coolies and workers organized to run for election. The lower-level working people in the 56 streets, who had suffered enough oppression and knew that it was related to their own interests, rose up to compete with the upper classes, making this election a mass democratic movement. As a result of the election, workers and poor people accounted for 60 percent of those elected; the middle and lower classes accounted for 20 percent; and the middle and upper classes accounted for 15 percent.\n    I feel that here I can answer a question that people across the country are concerned about, that is, what kind of life are the people of Northeast China living after \"August 15th.\" One month ago, Pang Chenggao was still a worker. Before \"August 15th,\" he lived in a dilapidated house where \"the kang was not much bigger than the table.\" His daughter was already grown up, but they still squeezed together to sleep. When the wind blew, tiles fell on them. Under such circumstances, he was also taken as a forced laborer, and he simply could not survive. He secretly shed tears. After \"August 15th,\" they organized and held a meeting at the Girls' School, and he was elected as the group leader. From then on, he worked and worked. Now he eats sorghum and rice and built a new house. One month before the recent election, Pang Chenggao was nominated as the street chief of Renzhong Street in Jintang District by everyone's hands.\n\n        Antung's Industry\n    Antung is a major industrial area in Northeast China. According to a Japanese book, \"The current state of the industry and mining machinery ranks first in all of Manchuria.\"\n    The province is rich in mineral resources. The iron ore in Huanren Kuandian, Antung's brass, and Fengcheng's lead have huge reserves. In addition, Kuandian's × mine and asbestos, mica, magnetite, gold, silver, fluorite, limestone, and coal (already explored by the Japanese) are found everywhere. The factories built with these raw materials include textile factories, rayon factories, cement factories, automobile factories, carbon factories, chemical factories, machinery factories, and paper mills. The Anfeng railway runs east-west through the area, and the Yalu River waterway runs north-south. Timber from the Changbai Mountain forest, as well as \"Balpu\" papermaking raw materials, are transported here in large quantities, developing wood and papermaking. The Yalu River \"Water Hand\" power plant supplies electricity. All of this gives Antung Province the conditions to become a large industrial area. Therefore, the Japanese planned to expand Antung City into a city that could accommodate two million people (the same as Shenyang). This is included in their plan to build Daito Port. If this plan is realized, there will be a huge ice-free port at the mouth of the Yalu River; from Antung City to Daito Port, there will be more than a hundred miles of prosperous cities. This time, I took a car along the river to investigate the southern suburbs of Antung and drove for dozens of miles, seeing that the equipment of the factories everywhere already had a scale of mutual connection.\n    The reporter visited the Yalu River Paper Mill, which is all machines. At one end, huge whole trees are put in, pulled by belts and electric saws and electric axes, ground into pieces in a huge machine, and then made into pulp. After passing through countless huge workshops, the white paper is continuously rolled out on the paper machine at the other end.\n    After \"August 15th,\" the Maintenance Association (an organization of enemy puppet remnants and reactionaries in disguise) once managed the regime, and Antung's industry suffered serious theft and destruction. For example, the Antung Textile Factory lost more than 600,000 catties of cotton, and the head of the Maintenance Association, Jiao Jianwu, and others stole a large number of platinum rings worth tens of millions of dollars from silk-making machines. At that time, all the mines and factories were frozen at once, and the workers lost their jobs in the cold winter. Soon the People's Democratic Government was organized and began to launch liquidation and rectification. Work gradually resumed from November to January. Smoke rose from the chimneys again. After January, it jumped into a period of expanded production. At this time, workers in papermaking, textiles, silk, rubber, clothing, matching, and timber manufacturing in Antung City participated in the Management Committee. Workers organized self-defense forces from the liquidation struggle, rose up to defend the factory, investigate materials, remove all obstacles to starting work, and pull the whistle on the first day of work. The resumption of work in the factory solved the problem of worker unemployment. With industrial products, calling on workers to expand production stabilized prices and prospered the market. The key to all these problems lies in relying on the working people. The lives of the workers have improved, and at the same time, the interests of the owners are taken care of. Especially because trade is free, private factories have been encouraged and developed. Eighty-six private factories have opened in Antung City, and 160 small factories have been added.\n    When I visited the Antung Textile Factory, I saw a female worker named Zhou Fenglan. She was 19 years old and came from the side of the machine wearing an apron. The factory site is very large. Looking across this room, rows of textile machines are rapidly rotating under the traction of power, and a complex and wonderful roar is emitted. I asked her about her life and production situation, and she proudly said, \"I earn 330 catties of rice a month, which is enough for my family to live on. We are now calculating according to physical objects, and the government does not allow us to suffer.\"\n    Then talking about the past: \"I worked since I was eight years old, earning six jiao a day. I could not get enough to eat. We all stole at that time and stuffed cloth into the machines.\" I was very surprised by her speech, and she spoke so naturally and loudly. She thought I did not understand: \"Let the machine break! We can have a rest. Twelve hours of work a day, if a Japanese devil sees you sitting down, he will beat you half to death. Standing next to the machine every day, the wind from the machine blows and my legs are twisted; some male workers have their entire arms twisted off by the machine, and they hold an empty sleeve. At that time, we all cried.\"\n    \"Now a worker earns at least 180 catties of grain, and wages have generally increased by 10 percent. In the past, the noodles we should have received were eaten by the Japanese, and we could only eat frozen potatoes. Now eating noodles is ours, and everyone eats happily.\" Later, I went to visit the kitchen she was talking about, where the rice was cooked with electricity.\n    Such an honest female worker smiled by herself. She is now a model worker in the textile factory because she has the best results in improving production. In a moment, several female workers who had finished work came over and surrounded her. From her expression, I knew she was their leader because she was a city councilor.\n    \"How do you participate in political activities?\"\n    \"After the Communist Party came, I went to the March 8th Women's Congress for the first time and listened to a lot of speeches. I did not dare to follow up myself. Later, when the factory held elections, they elected me as the chairman of the trade union, and later they elected me as the street representative.\" Other workers said loudly, \"We never had this status before!\" \"Later, I also participated in the City Council. I feel that if such a government leads us, how can we not be grateful? I am very happy this time. I want to learn quickly and work hard to do things well for everyone.\"\n    She suddenly smiled. \"I always hated not being a man before, but now I don't think so.\"\n    Production at the Antung Textile Factory has increased, and workers can produce more than twice as much as during the puppet Manchukuo era. In general public factories, output in February doubled compared with March. Because Zhou Fenglan is not the only one, but countless people. I often see men and women workers returning from the factory on the street, talking and laughing, walking past me with their chests out.\n\n            Wealthy Days Have Arrived\n    In the past, the people of Antung lived in a rich place but lived a poor life. Those were tragic days.\n    All the materials from factories to rural areas were moved and scraped clean by the Japanese, and were governed in various associations. Even the bean stalks in the fields had associations. The people had to be rationed for everything they ate and used. Free trade had long become a thing of the past. People struggled in this strict rule for more than ten years.\n    Since the establishment of the democratic government, it first destroyed all tax organs of the past \"Manchukuo\" and established a trade administration representing the interests of the people. Its task is to support production, develop free trade, balance prices, absorb a large number of necessary materials from outside, and solve the daily necessities of the people. After its establishment, it guaranteed the supply of salt, coal, grain, paper, and cloth. People in Antung have not felt poor these days. Corn flour costs 17 yuan a catty, and salt, which used to sell for 7 yuan, now costs 2 yuan. The daily transactions of Northeast stores used to be 300,000, but increased to 3 million in January; the inventory at the end of March was 18 million yuan, all proving the prosperity and upward flight of commerce. In terms of taxation: More than 100 kinds of puppet Manchukuo taxes have been abolished. Rewards are given for the import of necessities, the export of surplus items such as coal, iron, and wood, restrictions are placed on the import of luxury goods, and the import of contraband is prohibited.\n    Antung Province has countless salt-producing areas along the river, with a total of 1,572 public salt fields and 1,460 private salt fields. Not only can it supply salt for the entire Northeast, but it can also be exported in large quantities, with a current inventory of 6.13 million shi of salt. The puppet Manchukuo's official transportation and sales methods were abolished and replaced with a tax system to encourage free trading. The government also loaned 10 million yuan to purchase machinery and build salt dams.\n    In the past, except for a few ration stores and a few \"processing industrial areas,\" all industry and commerce were suspended. Now the pulse of industry and commerce is active. In Antung, a city of more than 300,000 people, 3,152 stores have opened in just half a year. In other counties, such as Huanren, which used to have 17 stores with a daily turnover of 500-1,000 yuan per store, the number has now increased, with a daily turnover of 7,000-23,000 yuan per store. Zhuanghe County increased from 762 to 962 stores. Fengcheng added 1,000 stores.\n    In the financial sector: The democratic government took over the Central Bank of Manchuria and established the Antung Bank. The Joint Liquidation Office of Enemy and Puppet Financial Institutions newly established the Northeast Bank and provided loans of approximately 70 million yuan in agriculture, industry, salt industry, and fishing industry. In terms of grain: the enemy and puppet warehouses were opened and distributed to the people. In the past, the burden of \"shipment\" (government forcibly collecting) was lifted from the farmers (in the past, this burden was 100 percent for rice and soybeans, and 2.16 shi per mu for coarse grains), as well as \"moral shipment\" and \"gratitude shipment\" (repaying the Japanese for their kindness). At the same time, democratic government organs at all levels and military organs launched production movements to reduce the burden on the people. They plan to solve one-fifth of all expenses from this April, and will soon begin to be completely self-sufficient.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鸭绿江边的安东\n刘白羽\n1946-08-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鸭绿江边的安东\n    刘白羽\n    记者是由抚顺、本溪进入安东地区的。从抚顺到本溪是一条艰难的汽车路，从本溪开始却是畅通的安奉铁路，安奉路穿过曲折的摩天岭直到鸭绿江边。据车站上铁路员工告诉我，民主政府已在增修一条支路，由凤凰城北至宽甸一段。这条路原来日本人计划准备直达通化，但未曾筑起，现在却已动工了。\n    安东市沿江边发展起来，江水湛绿，记者听说萧华将军的战士们，初到此地看到鸭绿江，有人竟高兴得跳跃起来说：“毛主席说过打到鸭绿江边啊！”是的，他们是真到鸭绿江边了。\n    江上有铁桥，彼岸即为北朝鲜之新义洲。“满洲国”时期，曾经过这桥把一切掠夺物资经朝鲜运往日本。\n    直通火车站是一条中心大街，整洁宽畅，名为毛泽东路。走下去就是杨靖宇路、邓铁梅路。市中心为繁荣的商业区。几里之遥，行人摩肩接踵。物价奇低，从市南端到北端坐一趟马车只要五元钱，如果是重庆，五元钱票子是常会被人丢弃在地下的。金融稳定，一元东北银行币可换二元“满洲”币，可换二十六元法币。工厂都已开工，从山上望去烟囱遍布，四郊商店里的布、纸烟、纺织品都是本地工厂出品。\n    安东省有三百四十四万四千人口，耕地面积为二千余万亩。有十万工人在工厂、矿山作工。\n            翻身\n    从民主政权建立那一天起，安东省恢复了自己的生命和自由，他们立刻向屠杀他们的人进行报复。田宝守是一个洋车夫，为了向吸血鬼——人力车组合的尹长秋清算，他白天拉车记下别人谈的材料晚间开会。最后在永乐舞台竟组织了二千多人的大斗争，尹长秋当场吐出十四万元赔偿大家的损失。\n    元宝区有一个刘为治，他在伪满时代做一个班长（街长以下管二百多人），依仗儿子在县政府里有势力无恶不作，没人提起他不恨，从前敢恨不敢言语，现在他们再也压制不住了，纷纷起来向他清算。他们把这从前谁也不敢多看一眼的老奸贼，带到九合成工厂里去算账，一个穷人告他从前抓劳工的时候怎样打人骂人，又有些人告他替伪满向老百姓收麻袋，他叫人出钱买了，结果他全都私自留下了。从前赵金山花五百元买两间房子，向他报迁移户口，他说：\n    “搬家理由不合，不给报。”\n    那个年代不报上户口就领不到配给粮，就得挨饿。赵金山女人去求情也给骂开了，后来送了二十斤肉，还有鸡子，他才说一句：“先住下再调查吧！”可是又露出风说，搬家的十有九是八路军，果然没一个月他就把赵金山抓了去当劳工。赵的女人正在怀孕，赵跪下哀求，他哼了一声说：“叫你们死就死，没话！”赵没法花了二千元雇了一个劳工。过几天刘为治又把他领配给粮的粮票拿走，一家饿饭。女人刚生下孩子气死了，孩子也死了，这时就丢下赵金山带着一个十七岁姑娘、两个小孩。姑娘不久又给人拐跑了。没一个月刘为治又逼着他背了孩子去当劳工，到市政府去请求，给骂回来。这时他一家都毁了，思前想后，忍无可忍就找到刘为治争吵起来，刘就把他当做“浮浪”（游手好闲的人）送到煤矿里去了。现在赵金山回来了，他站在那里，衣衫褴褛、肮脏、已失去人形，但两眼闪着仇恨的光，连狡滑得像老狐狸一样的刘为治脸色也变了。\n    一件件控诉下去，最后有人揭发他在“八、一五”后，趁着乱腾腾的时候，从蛤蟆塘车站，把木料拉了二十根，还有一百吨煤、铁、洋灰。\n    这一个伟大的翻身运动，是人民控诉，人民处决的。在安东市有日本战争罪犯十六个，汉奸六个，全省有八十六万人参加到这翻身运动里边来，收回自己失去的一切。\n            民主生活\n    到安东的第二天，我在省参议会会场——市政府楼上访问了新选出的议长陈先舟先生。\n    陈先生是通化人，曾在日本仙台高等工业学校学电机，回国后任东三省电台台长、吉林省国民党党部委员，现在他还是重庆民主政治协进会的一个领导者。不久前经过无数困难他回到这里来。\n    同一地方，时间是中午，我又会晤了副议长张东民老先生。他已七十六岁了，须发皆白，满面笑容，他是老同盟会员，推翻满清东北起义时他是军政府的领导人。民国五年讨袁他又再度奋发起义，大革命时代他又是辽宁宪草委员会委员，大革命后，他渐渐的发觉了国民党已走向黑暗腐败的道路，他遂弃政就医，埋头经营医院。对于东北前途他主张自治，他说：“这是他的老主张，这也不违背国家统一呀！”\n    世界上别的国家也有自治，各处可以组织考察团来看看，这里做得好就应该照这里的样子做。”\n    另一个副议长是安东省中共代表林一山同志，他的右手在战争中变为残废，他是一个精明、智慧、诚恳的人。\n    这以后我整整四五天坐在参议会旁听席上。去冬人民代表会议选出的临时民主政府副主席刘澜波向大会报告政府工作时，他说：“人民是东家，我们向东家报告工作情形。”报告后展开了热烈讨论。特别是四月十七日大会上进行竞选省府委员，我看到各阶层的人带着他们特有的习惯、作风、姿态走到扩音器前面，有的为自己竞选，有的为别人竞选，他们是严肃而认真的。我看到高崇民先生——这位民主老战士他说：“我看到刘副主席每天为了工作睡不上五小时觉，这是共产党的美德。可是我真为他担扰……。”他感动得半天说不出话来，台下起了一片掌声。\n    在这次参议会筹备会里，有一个李金声是个地主，原是闭门不出的，后来他突然出来了，他的朋友问他，他说：“我有理由”，他说出了几条道理来：有一次一部分民主联军队伍来到了屯上没住处，也不肯进村子惊动老百姓，就住在屯外破房里，天落着雪连窗户也没有，就这样住了两晚走了。他说：“中国有这样的军队就可以了！”其次他看到民主政权中的工作人员亲密团结，起初他以为都是老朋友，后来才知道是有山南地北各处来的，极为惊讶，于是他说：“我不能昧着良心了，共产党是好的我得出来一齐干了。”\n    安东自从去年八月解放以来，一方面把敌伪残余铲除，一方面就召开了人民代表会议，在这会议上选出了临时民主政府。从此安东走上了新的道路，各县都成立了民意机关，选举了县行政委员和县长，从村到区都进行了人民选举，改造了政权。\n    在安东市进行普选时，各街都自由的选出代表，再由三百五十人开大会选出参议员和市长，那是非常热烈的。洋东夫、工人都组织竞选，五十六条街下层劳苦市民，受够了欺压知道了这与自己利害相关，纷纷起来与上层竞选，使这次选举成为一次群众性的民主运动。选举结果工人、贫民当选者占百分之六十；中下层占百分之二十；中上层占百分之十五。\n    我觉得在这里我可以解答一个全国人士所关心的问题了，就是“八、一五”以后东北人民过的是什么样的生活。一个月以前还是一个工人的庞乘皋，“八、一五”前住一间破房“炕比桌子大不了一点”，女儿早成年了，还挤在一齐睡，一刮风瓦片就落到身上来，就在这种情况下他又给拉了劳工，简直无法活，暗自落泪。“八、一五”后，他们组织起来在女子学校开会，他被选作了组长，从这以后他一面作工一面工作，现在吃起粱粮、大米，钉起了一处新的房屋，一个月以前一次民选当中庞乘皋给大家举手选任金汤区仁忠街街长。\n        安东的工业\n    安东是东北的主要工业区。据一册日文书籍上说：“工矿机之现状，堪居全满之首位。”\n    全省矿藏丰富。埋藏量巨大的桓仁宽甸的铁矿、安东的黄铜、凤城之铅。此外宽甸的×矿及各处之石棉、云母、磁石、金银萤石、石灰石、石炭（已经日人探掘）。这些原料建立的工厂有纺织厂、人造纤维工厂、洋灰工厂、自动车工厂、炭素工厂、化学工厂、机械工厂、纸厂等。此地东西有安奉铁路线，南北有鸭绿江航线。长白山大森林的木材，以及“巴尔普”造纸原料，大批运到这里来，发展了木材造纸，鸭绿江的“水手”发电厂供应电力，这种种使安东省具备了，成为一个大工业区的条件。因此，日本人拟订了扩大安东市成为容纳二百万人的都市（相同与沈阳）。这包括在他们的建设大东港计划里面。如果这计划实现，在鸭绿江入海处，就将有一巨大的不冻港；从安东市到大东港，就将有一百里以上绵延的繁华都市。我此次曾乘汽车沿江向安东南郊考察，驶行数十里，见各处工厂设备确已有彼此联接的规模了。\n    记者曾参观了鸭绿江造纸厂，全都是机器。一端以巨大的整棵树木投入，经过皮带曳引电锯电斧，在一庞大机器中磨为碎片，而后制成矍浆，经过无数巨大的场房，最后在另一端造纸机上不停的滚出白纸。\n    “八、一五”后，维持会（敌伪残余与反动派改头换面的组织）一度管理政权，安东工业遭受了严重的盗卖及摧残。像安东纺织厂棉花失去六十余万斤，维持会长焦建吾等盗去大批造丝机上价值千万元的白金圈。当时矿山、工厂全部一下冻结了，工人在寒冷的冬天里失了业。不久人民民主政府组织起来了，开始发动清算、整顿。十一月到一月逐渐复工。烟囱上又冒烟了。一月以后就跃入扩大生产时期了。这时全安东市造纸、纺织、丝绸、胶皮、被服、配造、制材等工人参加管理委员会。工人从清算斗争中组织了自卫队，起来保卫工厂，清查物资，扫除了一切开工的阻障，拉起第一天开工的汽笛来。工厂的复工解决了工人失业问题，有了工业品，号召工人扩大生产平抑了物价，繁荣了市场，而这一切问题的总关键在于依靠劳动人民。工人生活改善了，同时也照顾到东家利益。特别因为贸易自由了，私人经营工厂得到了鼓励与发展，八十六家私营工厂在安东市开了工，小型工厂还增加了一百六十家。\n    我参观了安东纺织厂时，我看到一个叫周凤兰的女工，她十九岁，围着围裙从机器旁走来。这工厂厂址极大，从这房一眼望过去，一排排纺织机在动力牵引下迅急的转动着，而发出一种复杂奇妙的轰响。我问她的生活和生产情况，她骄傲的说：“我一个月赚三百三十斤米，够一家人生活。我们现在是按实物计算，政府不让我们吃亏。”\n    随后谈到往事：“我从八岁作工，一天赚六角钱，吃不饱饭，我们那时都偷、都往机器里塞布。”我很惊讶她的讲话，她讲得那样自然响亮。她以为我不了解：“让机器坏呀！我们好休息。一天十二小时工，坐一下给日本鬼子看到打个半死。每天站在机器旁边，机器的风吹得腿都拐了；有的男工整条胳膊给机器绞去，就持着个空袖筒。那时候我们都哭。”\n    “现在一个工人最少赚一百八十斤粮食，工资普遍提高了百分之十。从前我们应该领到的面都给日本人吃，我们只能吃到冻坏了的土豆子。现在吃面是我们的了，大家吃的高兴。”我后来就去参观了她所说的厨房，烧饭都是用电力。\n    这样诚实的女工自己笑起来，她现在是纺织厂里的模范工人，因为她在提高生产上有了最优良的成绩。一会工夫几个下了班的女工走拢来围住她，从她的表情上我知道她是她们的领袖，因为她是个市参议员。\n    “你怎样参加政治活动？”\n    “共产党来了以后，第一次去参加三八妇女大会，听了很多讲话，自己可不敢跟上去。后来厂里选举，把我举作职工会会长，后来她们又选我作街代表。”别的工友都高声说：“从前咱们那里有这个地位！”“后来又参加了市参议会，觉得这样政府领导我们，我们怎能不感谢。这次我非常高兴，我要赶紧学习会作工作，为大家把事情办好。”\n    她突然笑了。“从前自己总恨不是个男子，现在我不这样想了。”\n    安东纺织厂生产提高了，工人比伪满时生产量都能超出两倍以上。一般公营工厂，二月比三月产量提高了一倍。因为不是周凤兰一个是无数的人。我经常在街上看到，从工厂回来的男女工人，说着笑着，挺起胸脯从我身边走过…………。\n            富裕的日子来到了\n    从前安东人民生长在富裕的地方，过着穷困的生活，那是些悲惨的日子。\n    所有的物资从工厂到农村，日本人把它搬刮干干净净，统治在各种组合里，连田地里的豆杆子也有组合。人民要吃要用都是配给，自由贸易早就变成历史的陈迹。人们就在这严格统治里挣扎了十几年。\n    自从民主政府建立以来，首先就摧毁了过去“满洲国”一切税收机关，建立了代表人民利益的贸易管理局。它的任务是扶助生产，发展自由贸易，平衡物价，从外边吸收必需的大批物资，解决人民日常生活用品。在成立以后确实的保证了盐、煤、粮、纸、布的供给。安东人这些日子里没感到贫乏，包米面一斤十七元，盐从前卖七元现在二元了。东北商店从前每日交易为三十万，一月份增到三百万；三月底存货额为一千八百万元，都证明商业的繁荣向上飞。税收方面：一百种以上的伪满税收被取消了。奖励必需品入口，奖励煤铁木材等剩余品出口，限制奢侈品入口，禁止违禁品入口。\n    安东省沿江有无数产盐区，计公营盐摊一千五百七十二处；民营盐摊一千四百六十处。不仅可供全东北食盐，还可大量出口，现存六百一十三万石盐。取消了伪满官运官销办法，改为征税制，鼓励自由贩购。政府还在这方面贷款一千万购制机器修筑盐坝。\n    从前除了几家配给店，几家“加工工区”外，一切工商停止。现在工商脉搏活跃了，安东市区三十余万人口的城市，短短半年中已开了三千一百五十二家商店。其他外县，如桓仁过去十七家商店，每店每日营业额为五百——一千，现在增加了，每店每日营业额为七千——二万三千元了。庄河县由七百六十二家增加到九百六十二家。凤凰城增加了一千家商店。\n    在金融方面：民主政府接收了伪满洲中央银行，成立安东银行。敌伪金融机关联合清理处，新成立了东北银行，并进行贷款，在农业、工业、盐业、渔业各方面约七千万元。粮食方面：把敌伪仓库打开分给人民。过去“出荷”（政府强令交纳）负担从农民身上解除了（过去这项负担大米、大豆为百分之百，粗粮每亩地二石一斗六升），还有“道义出荷”、“报恩出荷”（报日本人的恩）。同时各级民主政权机关，军事机关展开生产运动，减轻人民负担。他们计划从今年四月份起，各机关自己解决全部开支的五分之一，不久就开始全部自给。"

    "content": "The traitorous and country-selling ringleader, in order to sell out the motherland and destroy the democratic liberated areas, has mobilized Chiang's troops, equipped by the United States, to encircle and annihilate our Central Plains Military Region, attack our Subei, Shandong, and southern Shanxi liberated areas, and bomb our CPC Central Committee's location in Yan'an, and the Yan'an headquarters. Relying on the support of their master, the American imperialist elements, they have formally declared war on the democratic forces of all the Chinese people. The flames of civil war are rapidly spreading.\n\nComrades! Compatriots! Our Chinese nation is facing a grave crisis. On the one hand, the traitorous dictator Chiang Kai-shek is attempting to steal the fruits of the War of Resistance by utilizing the remnants of Japanese fascism, maintain his dictatorial rule, and strangle all the basic rights of the Chinese people. On the other hand, American imperialist elements are preparing to enslave the Chinese people through traitorous ringleaders. They have effectively taken control of our country's military, political, and economic lifeline, seizing our motherland's territory, airspace, territorial waters, and inland navigation rights. American goods are flooding everywhere, destroying national industries. The motherland is increasingly moving towards the path of becoming an American dependency. The eight years of bloody War of Resistance to drive out Japanese imperialism aimed to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality. However, contrary to expectations, Chiang Kai-shek is preparing to replace Wang Jingwei, while American imperialist elements are preparing to replace the position of Japanese imperialism. The US-Chiang collaboration is to usurp the fruits of our eight-year War of Resistance. After eight years of heroic resistance and bloody sacrifice, we have not obtained independence, peace, and democracy. The fruits obtained through heroic resistance and bloody sacrifice have been stolen and sold out by traitorous and dictatorial elements. Now, only a just patriotic war can smash the mad offensive of traitorous and dictatorial elements, defend national independence and the integrity of national sovereignty and territory, and defend the liberated areas to realize independence, peace, and democracy. Without the victory of the patriotic war, there will be no peace, no democracy, no independence and freedom. The traitorous ringleaders can more easily sell out. Our sacred patriotic self-defense war is a war for independence, peace, and democracy!\n\nNow, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army has invaded and continues to approach our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. Hu Zongnan's four armies are gathering in Yuncheng and Wenxi, actively advancing north. The 10th, 41st, and 47th Armies, which are besieging the Central Plains, are ordered to advance towards northern and eastern Henan. The disaster is deep! The time is pressing! All the soldiers and civilians in our border region should urgently mobilize and join hands with patriotic and democratic people in all liberated areas and Chiang-occupied areas to fight together for the realization of independence, peace, and democracy.\n\nIn order to win this war, we call on all soldiers and civilians in the entire border region, regardless of gender, age, or background, to mobilize and fight to implement the following tasks:\n\n\t(1) Soldiers of the Border Region, all commanders, fighters, political workers, artillerymen, cavalrymen, engineers, comrades and combat heroes, you should continue the glorious tradition of the eight-year War of Resistance and the Shangdang-Pinghan self-defense operations, carry forward the new heroism, fight bravely and resolutely annihilate the enemy, seize Chiang's army weapons to arm yourselves, and be willing to sacrifice everything to defend the motherland and hometown. This is your supreme glory; you should carry forward the flexible and mobile combat style, strengthen the combination of technology and tactics, and the coordinated actions between various arms and services; you must remember Chairman Mao's military guiding ideology in any case, to fight annihilation battles, to fight prepared battles; you should seize all combat intervals to conduct training, improve the three major techniques, improve the tactical literacy of commanders, and absorb new combat experience; you should strengthen unity, be harmonious internally, be ruthless towards the enemy, abide by discipline, obey orders, and especially carry forward the spirit of serving the people and being closely united with the masses, sharing life and death and difficulties. Victory is definitely ours.\n\n\t(2) Widely develop mass guerrilla warfare. All local armed forces, armed work teams, guerrillas, and millions of militiamen in the entire region, you should carry forward the tradition of the eight-year anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, go to the front line, go to the rear of the invaders, cooperate with the main force in combat, persist in the struggle in areas temporarily occupied by Chiang's army, strengthen activities in the border areas, destroy the invaders' railways and highways, intercept their supplies, cut off their supply lines, attack their transportation units, implement a scorched earth policy, launch landmine warfare, and use all effective methods to kill and injure the enemy. In the rear of Chiang's army, protect our democratic regime, maintain the interests of the masses, and establish new armed forces, so that Chiang's army is attacked from both the front and the rear, in order to cooperate with the main force to annihilate the enemy and retake all lost territories.\n\n\t(3) Strengthen the rear work and fully support the front line, everything for the victory of the front line. We call on all young and middle-aged people in the region to enthusiastically join the soldiers of the Border Region and ensure that the main force is constantly fully staffed. We require all military factories, logistics personnel, doctors, and nurses to work hard, intensify their work, and improve work efficiency and technical level. We call on militiamen, self-defense team members, and war participants to enthusiastically participate in stretcher rescue and transportation and other war service work, and do this work well, and strive to transport materials to ensure the supply of troops, so that they can get adequate food, clothing and material supplements.\n\n\t(4) Strengthen the political offensive, launch the righteous movement of Gao Shuxun and Kong Congzhou against civil war, against treason, and to participate in the people's cause, expand the patriotic united front, and call on all patriotic Kuomintang officers and soldiers who do not want civil war to carry out anti-civil war and anti-treason uprisings and stand on the side of the people. We warmly welcome them, respect their officer-soldier organizational life methods and traditional habits, and help them become the people's army. We are willing to cooperate with all patriotic people who advocate democracy and are for peace in China, regardless of class, gender, race, worker, peasant, soldier, student, or merchant, a grand alliance, to strive for independence, peace, and democracy.\n\n\t(5) Realize \"land to the tillers,\" open up the path for the development of capitalist industry and agriculture, continue to mobilize the masses, and implement the mass emancipation movement. We must thoroughly carry out the anti-traitor liquidation, confiscate the land of the great traitors and distribute it to the landless and land-poor peasants, so that the working peasants have land to cultivate and food to eat; we must take care of the lives of landlords and rich peasants, so that they also have land to cultivate and food to eat; we must further develop industrial production and develop capitalism in the liberated areas. In villages and areas that have already realized \"land to the tillers,\" we must organize farmers to produce well and prepare for next year's spring production campaign. This is an important guarantee for us to win the self-defense war and the patriotic war. No matter what the circumstances, we must insist on its realization and not relax in the slightest because of the urgency of the war.\n\n\t(6) Strive for production and frugality, everything from a long-term perspective, overcome the phenomenon of waste of manpower and material resources, especially in war service mobilization, scientific calculation is required, organize manpower and material resources, and avoid waste; we must be thrifty and honest, oppose corruption and waste; we must strengthen the development of agriculture, household sideline, factories, handicrafts, transportation, cooperative businesses, and mining industries, and carry forward the model of combining production and combat during the War of Resistance, and try to mobilize women and other semi-laborers to participate in production, and carry out a large-scale production campaign. And take all effective measures to stabilize prices, in order to improve people's lives, increase people's wealth, support long-term warfare, and ensure military and civilian food.\n\nComrades! Compatriots! We have full confidence in victory. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries have their serious difficulties: financial difficulties, officers and soldiers are tired of war and anti-war, morale is low, continuous anti-civil war and anti-traitor uprisings are taking place, disasters are extremely serious, people are living in poverty, people's grievances are boiling, people's rebellions are rising, the national democratic movement is surging, and the people of the whole country oppose the traitorous and unjust war carried out by the traitorous ringleaders; we have sufficient conditions for victory, all soldiers and civilians have the experience of persisting in the eight-year anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines, and the experience of the victory of the first self-defense war. We are a just patriotic self-defense war, with the sympathy and support of the anti-fascist people of the whole country. The broad masses of people have already turned themselves over, and have the brotherly cooperation of the liberated areas. As long as we are closely united around the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, thoroughly complete the above tasks, we will surely win, victory is ours! Let us shout:\n\nCrush the offensive of the traitorous ringleaders!\nThe soldiers and civilians of the entire border region are mobilized to strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war!\nFight to the end for independence, peace, and democracy!\nResolutely follow the Communist Party of China forward, follow Chairman Mao forward!\n\n\t\tThe Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu of the Communist Party of China, August 15\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为粉碎蒋介石进攻晋冀鲁豫解放区暨争取爱国战争胜利的号召\n\n1946-08-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　为粉碎蒋介石进攻晋冀鲁豫解放区暨争取爱国战争胜利的号召\n    汉奸卖国贼头子为出卖祖国摧毁民主的解放区，调集美国所装备起来的蒋军围歼我中原军区，进攻我苏北山东及晋南解放区，轰炸我中共中央所在地延安，及延安总部。它们凭借其主子美帝国主义分子的扶持，已向全中国人民民主力量正式宣战，内战烽火正在迅速的蔓延中。\n    同志们！同胞们！我中华民族正面临着严重危机，一方面是卖国独夫蒋介石利用日本法西斯残余企图窃取抗战果实，维持其独裁统治，必欲绞杀中国人民的一切基本权利；一方面是美帝国主义分子准备通过汉奸卖国贼头子来奴役中国人民，它实际上已掌握了我国的军事政治经济命脉，攫取了我祖国的领土领空领海及内河航行权，美货到处泛滥，摧毁民族工业，祖国濒危日益走上美国附庸国的道路。八年流血抗战，赶走日本帝国主义，其目的在求中国之独立自由平等，但事与愿违，蒋介石准备代替汪精卫，美帝国主义分子则准备代替日本帝国主义的地位，美蒋合作以篡窃我八年抗战的果实，我们在八年抗战之后没有得到独立和平与民主，英勇抗战流血牺牲所换来的果实，为汉奸卖国贼独裁主义者所窃取所出卖，现在只有以正义的爱国战争来粉碎汉奸卖国贼独裁主义者的疯狂进攻，保卫民族独立与国家主权领土的完整，保卫解放区以实现独立和平与民主，如果没有爱国战争的胜利，就没有和平可言，就没有民主可言，就不会有独立和自由，汉奸卖国贼头子就更可顺利的出卖，我们进行神圣的爱国自卫战争，就是为独立和平与民主而战！\n    现在蒋介石反动大军已侵入并继续逼近我晋冀鲁豫边区，胡宗南指挥的四个军正集结运城闻喜积极北进，围攻中原的第十军、四十一军、四十七军正奉令向我豫北豫东挺进，祸深矣！时迫矣！我全边区军民应紧急动员，同各解放区及蒋占区的爱国民主人士们携起手来，共同为实现独立和平与民主而战。\n    为了争取这一战争的胜利，我们号召全边区军民不分男女老幼一致动员起来，为实行下列的任务而斗争。\n    （一）全边区的子弟兵、全体指战员、政工人员、炮兵、骑兵、工兵同志们和战斗英雄们，你们应继续八年抗战和上党平汉自卫作战的光荣传统，发扬新英雄主义，勇敢作战坚决歼灭敌人，夺取蒋军武装来武装自己，为保卫祖国与家乡不惜牺牲一切，这是你们无上光荣；你们应发扬机动灵活的战斗作风，加强技术与战术的结合，各兵种各部队间的协同动作；你们在任何情况下都要记取毛主席的军事指导思想，要打歼灭仗，要打有准备的仗；你们应抓紧一切战斗间隙进行练兵提高三大技术，提高指挥员的战术素养，吸收新的战斗经验；你们应加强团结，对内要和，对敌要狠，遵守纪律，服从命令，特别要发扬为人民服务的精神和群众亲密一致，同生死共患难，胜利一定是我们的。\n    （二）广泛开展群众游击战争，一切地方武装、武工队、游击队及全区百万民兵们，你们应发扬八年抗日游击战争的传统，到前线去，到进攻者的后方去，协同主力作战，坚持暂时被蒋军侵占地区的斗争，强化边沿区活动，破坏进攻者的铁路公路，击截它的辎重，切断它的补给线，打击它的运输部队，实行空室清野，发动地雷战，用一切有效方法杀伤敌人，在蒋军的后方则保护我民主政权维持群众利益，建立新的武装，使蒋军腹背受击，以便配合主力军歼灭敌人，夺回一切失地。\n    （三）加强后方工作，全力支援前线，一切为着前线的胜利。我们号召全区一切青壮年要踊跃参加子弟兵，保证主力军不断满员。我们要求一切军需工厂后勤人员医生护士们努力生产加紧工作，提高工作效能与技术水平。我们号召民兵自卫队员及参战群众们，踊跃参加担架救护和运输等战勤工作，并把这一工作搞好，要努力输将，保证部队的供给，使他们得到充分的衣食和物质补充。\n    （四）加强政治攻势，开展高树勋，孔从周反对内战，反对卖国，参加人民事业的正义运动，扩大爱国主义统一战线，号召一切不愿内战的爱国的国民党官兵实行反内战反卖国起义，站到人民方面来，我们热烈的欢迎他们，尊重他们的官长士兵组织生活方法和传统习惯，帮助他们成为人民的军队。我们愿与一切爱国的、主张民主的、为了中国和平的人士合作，不分阶级性别种族工农兵学商大联合，为争取独立和平与民主而奋斗。\n    （五）实现耕者有其田，开辟资本主义工农业发展的途径继续动员群众，贯彻群众翻身运动，要彻底进行反奸清算，没收大汉奸的土地分给无地少地的农民，使劳动农民有地种有饭吃；要照顾地主富农的生活，使其同样有地种有饭吃；要更加发展工业生产，发展解放区的资本主义，在已经实现了耕者有其田的村庄和地区，要很好的组织农民生产及准备明年春季大生产运动。这是我们争取自卫战争爱国战争胜利的重要保证，不管在任何情况下要坚持其实现，不能因战争紧迫而丝毫放松。\n    （六）努力生产节约，一切从长期打算，克服人力物力的浪费现象，在战勤动员中尤需科学计算，组织人力物力，避免浪费；必须节衣缩食廉洁奉公，反对贪污浪费；必须加强农业、家庭副业、工厂手工业、运输事业、合作事业及采矿业的发展，发扬抗战期间生产与战斗相结合的模范，尽量发动妇女等半劳动力参加生产，开展大生产运动。并以一切有效之措施稳定物价，借以改善人民生活，增加人民财富，支持长期战争，保证军需民食。\n    同志们！同胞们！我们有充分胜利信心，蒋介石反动派有其严重的困难，财政困难、官兵厌战反战，士气低落，不断举行反内战反卖国起义，灾荒极端严重，民不聊生、民怨沸腾、民变蜂起，全国民主运动高涨，全国人民反对汉奸卖国贼头子所进行的卖国的非正义的战争；我们则有足够的胜利条件，全体军民都有坚持敌后八年抗战的经验，有第一次自卫战争胜利的经验，我们是正义的爱国自卫战争，有全国反法西斯人民的同情和拥护，广大人民已经翻了身，有各解放区弟兄般的配合，只要我们紧紧的团结在中共中央及毛主席的周围，彻底完成上述任务，我们一定会胜利的，胜利是我们的！让我们高呼：\n    粉碎汉奸卖国贼的进攻！\n    全边区军民动员起来，争取爱国自卫战争的胜利！\n    为独立和平民主奋斗到底！\n    坚决跟着中国共产党前进，跟着毛主席前进！\n                         中国共产党晋冀鲁豫中央局  八月十五日"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 15th -- The spokesperson of the CCP Delegation in Beiping Military Mediation Department, regarding Chiang Kai-shek's use of American aircraft to continuously bomb various liberated areas, particularly the bombing of the Yan'an Headquarters on August 2nd, issued another statement on the 10th. It pointed out: \"Whether it admits it or not, the US government should be responsible for the Kuomintang air force's atrocities across the country.\" The spokesperson recounted that from the January ceasefire agreement to July 28th, Kuomintang aircraft intruded into various liberated areas 731 times, attacked liberated area towns and cities 268 times, causing 1,400 civilian casualties and destroying over 1,200 houses. The spokesperson pointed out: It is evident that when China's dictator and war maniac, Chiang Kai-shek, holds these offensive weapons, he will undoubtedly use them without restraint to destroy production and slaughter the people, further worsening the situation in China. Moreover, the bombing of the Yan'an Headquarters by eight Kuomintang American-made aircraft on August 2nd sent a signal of full-scale civil war. The spokesperson pointed out: Regarding this matter, the CCP delegations in Nanjing and Beiping have both received instructions and conclusive evidence from Yan'an and have lodged the most serious protests with the Kuomintang government, but have not yet received a reply. If the government wishes to deny that this is a signal for its full-scale civil war, the government should immediately take the following measures: (1) Order an investigation into this atrocity and severely punish the officers responsible for the atrocity. (2) The entire Chinese air force should be placed under the management and supervision of the Beiping Executive Headquarters to limit its deepening of the Chinese civil war and the slaughter of the Chinese people. The spokesperson then explained the relationship between the Kuomintang aircraft's atrocities and the United States: \"The whole world knows that these airplanes, airplane gasoline, weapons, and ammunition used to slaughter the Chinese people are all made in the United States. The US government has achieved peace throughout the world and has stopped the Lend-Lease Act to other countries, but it has extended the Lend-Lease Act to China alone, handing over a large number of murderous weapons to the Kuomintang government. All of Chiang Kai-shek's aviation personnel have also been trained by American officers in the United States, India, or China. The Kuomintang air force is essentially fostered by the United States. The US government has done everything for them, except actually pulling the trigger of the machine gun themselves.\" The spokesperson finally firmly stated: \"All peace-loving and democratic people in China unanimously condemn the US government's two-faced policy of, on the one hand, claiming to be a neutral mediator in China, and on the other hand, actually helping the Kuomintang to launch a civil war. We firmly demand that the US government promptly withdraw all military aircraft and military parts it has given to the Kuomintang government from China, so as not to deepen the Chinese civil war and inflict suffering on the Chinese people, in order to show the US government's neutral position.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北平中共代表团发言人  谴责蒋机袭延总部  主张全国空军由北平军调部管理蒋机涂炭解放区人民美国应负责\n\n1946-08-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北平中共代表团发言人\n    谴责蒋机袭延总部\n    主张全国空军由北平军调部管理蒋机涂炭解放区人民美国应负责\n    【新华社北平十五日电】北平军调部中共代表团发言人，为蒋介石使用美国飞机连续轰炸各解放区，特别是八月二日轰炸延安总部事，又于十日发表谈话。指出：“无论其承认与否，美国政府对国民党空军在全国的暴行应负其责”。发言人历述自一月停战协议以来，至七月二十八日，国民党飞机窜扰各解放区达七百三十一次，袭击解放区市镇二百六十八次，平民一千四百人被炸伤亡，房屋一千二百余间被炸毁。发言人指出：显而易见的，当中国独裁者战争狂的蒋介石手中握有这些进攻性的武器，就一定会无限制的用来破坏生产与屠杀人民，使中国局势益形恶化。而八月二日八架国民党美造飞机的轰炸延安总部，更发出了全面内战的信号。发言人指出：关于此事，南京和北平的中共代表团均接获延安指示及确凿的证据，已向国民党政府提出最严重的抗议，但至今未获答复。如果政府欲否认此举为其全面内战信号，政府应立即采取下述措施：（一）下令调查此次暴行，严厉处罚暴行负责军官。（二）全部中国空军应置于北平执行部管理监督之下，以限止其加深中国内战及屠杀中国人民。发言人继而说明国民党飞机的暴行和美国的关系：“举世皆知，用于屠杀中国人民的这些飞机、飞机的汽油、武器、弹药，全部是美国制造的。美国政府在全世界已获得和平，并对其他国家都停止了租借法案，而恰恰单独延长对中国的租借，将一切杀人武器大量交给国民党政府。蒋介石所有的航空人员，也都是由美国军官在美国、印度或中国训练出来的，国民党空军实质上是美国一手扶植起来的。美国政府已帮他们做尽了一切，只差没有亲手去搬动机枪的机柄罢了。”发言人最后坚称：“全中国一切爱好和平、民主的人民，一致谴责美国政府在中国一面表示自己是中立的调处人，一面又实际上帮助国民党发动内战的两面政策。我们坚决要求美国政府将它给国民党政府的一切军用飞机及其军火零件迅速从中国收回，以免加深中国内战，涂炭中国人民，以表示美国政府之中立地位。”"

Our liberated area's military and civilians are forced to defend themselves. A widespread guerrilla movement has now been launched in various border areas. In the Taiyue Second Military Sub-district, 5,000 militia members from nine counties, including Linfen and Quwo, are organized for rotational combat, conducting independent guerrilla activities on a 250-li long front from Jiang County in the south to Hongdong in the north, and undertaking rear area security work. Qin Qichang, a militia hero from Hongdong, using sniper fire combined with explosives, killed and wounded 27 Yan army soldiers in one instance. It is estimated that the militia in these nine counties conducted 283 self-defense battles in June and July, killing and wounding 298 Chiang, Yan, and puppet troops, capturing over 200 alive, and capturing 15 Chiang-Yan secret agents, seizing one machine gun and 13 rifles. Over a hundred militiamen in Jun County, Fourth Military Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, launched a fierce guerrilla offensive to commemorate \"August 1st,\" completely eliminating a unit of over 30 puppet troops under Niu Yingde stationed at Daokou, and seizing one machine gun, 45 rifles, and five pistols. The masses in the border areas of Anyang, Qingfeng, and other places, unable to bear the devastation of the Chiang and puppet troops, spontaneously organized stretcher teams, transport teams, and combat teams to participate in the war at any time. The masses in the rear also automatically cultivate land on behalf of the militia who are persisting in guerrilla warfare at the front. In the Yan-puppet occupied area of ​​Taihang Taigu, five youths from Huian and Xinzhuang risked escape while the Yan army's Houcheng Township political defense regiment was conscripting men. They captured alive a plainclothes member of the Yan army escorting them, along with a rifle and over 50 rounds of ammunition, and victoriously arrived in a certain area of ​​our liberated area.\n    [Report from this newspaper, Changzhi] The Shahe militia, in order to support the border struggle on the front lines of Yuan (shi) Huo (lu) Jing (xing) and to avenge the Yuan Shi Nan Su massacre, a strong militia detachment of over a hundred people was specially drawn by the county armed forces committee to form an expeditionary company, which set off for the northern front on July 20. When they departed, the villages gave them a warm send-off. The village chiefs and mutual aid team leaders all guaranteed to cultivate the land well for the families of the militia going on the expedition. The morale of the expeditionary militia was extremely high. When passing through Nanxingguo Village in Zanhuang, they received a notice that a heroes' meeting would be held in the whole region after the autumn harvest, which further encouraged their fighting enthusiasm. Everyone made their own plans. Old hero Hao Xiaosan proposed launching a sniper warfare campaign, vowing to kill eight stubborn enemies and puppets who dared to invade in the self-defense war. Chen Heqing then competed with Hao Xiaosan, and everyone actively considered how to strive to be a combat hero.\n    [Report from this newspaper, Changzhi] The Taigu County Headquarters issued an emergency instruction at the end of last month, calling on the local armed forces and militia of the entire county to launch a fierce guerrilla war and landmine explosion campaign, thoroughly blocking the stubborn enemy and puppet strongholds, in order to smash the Yan stubborn enemy’s attempt to divide our Taigu Liberated Area's plain areas. It was decided: 1. The County Armed Forces Committee will draw ten old area explosive experts to train militia in various new area villages, universally launching the landmine explosion campaign. 2. Quickly rectify the village militias, form guerrilla groups, take advantage of the rising green gauze curtains to carry out sparrow warfare, and attack small groups of stubborn enemies and puppet troops who come out to harass and plainclothes secret agents. And strengthen joint defense, with close contact between villages, supporting each other. 3. The militia in villages surrounding each stronghold will strictly surround the stronghold. The militia in old area mountain villages will organize rotation defense, guarding mountain passes and assisting in the siege of nearby stubborn enemy and puppet strongholds. 4. When the local backbone armed forces are on guard in each district by company, the company commander and political instructor will participate in the district headquarters to lead the local militia to act in unison. 5. Rectify the intelligence network, ensuring it is swift and accurate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各地民兵轮战自卫  配合主力展开游击攻势  临汾等九县民兵两月毙俘顽伪三百余\n\n1946-08-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各地民兵轮战自卫\n    配合主力展开游击攻势         \n    临汾等九县民兵两月毙俘顽伪三百余\n    【本报讯】蒋介石依靠美式装备，扩大内战，我解放区军民被迫自卫，现边沿各地，已掀起一规模广泛之游击运动。太岳二分区临汾、曲沃等九县五千民兵，组织轮战，在南起绛县北至洪洞二百五十里长的战线上，单独进行游击活动，并担任后方治安工作。洪洞民兵英雄秦其昌以冷枪结合爆炸，一次毙伤阎军二十七名。计该九县民兵六、七两月，共进行自卫战二百八十三次，毙伤蒋、阎、伪二百九十八名，生俘二百余名，并捕获蒋阎特务十五个，缴获机枪一挺，步枪十三枝。冀鲁豫四分区浚县民兵百余，为纪念“八一”，曾开展一次猛烈之游击攻势，将驻道口伪军牛英德一部三十余人全数消灭，并缴获机枪一挺、步枪四十五枝、手枪五枝。安阳、清丰等边沿群众，因不堪蒋伪军之摧残，纷纷自动组织担架队、运输队、战斗队随时参战，后方群众并自动为在前方坚持游击战争之民兵代耕。太行太谷一带阎伪侵占区，惠安、辛庄五个青年在阎军驻候城镇政卫团抓丁途中，冒险脱逃，并将押送他们的阎军便衣队员一名，活活捉住，连同步枪一枝、子弹五十余发，胜利到达我解放区某地。\n    【本报长治讯】沙河民兵为支援元（氏）获（鹿）井（陉）前线边地斗争，为元氏南苏惨案复仇，特由县武委会抽调坚强民兵百余人组成一远征连，于七月二十日开赴北线。出发时各村热烈欢送，村长与互助组长均保证为出征民兵家庭种好地。出征民兵情绪极高，路经赞皇南邢郭村时，接获秋后全区将召开群英大会的通知，更鼓励了他们的战斗热情，各人都订出自己的计划，老英雄郝小三提出开展冷枪战，要在自卫战争中击毙敢于进犯的顽、伪八人，陈河清则与郝小三竞赛，全体纷纷酝酿如何争取做一个战斗英雄。\n    【本报长治讯】太谷县指挥部于上月底发出紧急指示，号召全县地方武装与民兵，开展猛烈游击战与地雷爆炸运动，彻底封锁顽、伪据点，以粉碎阎顽分割我太谷解放区平川地区的企图。并决定：一、由县武委会抽调老区爆炸能手十人，赴新区各村训练民兵，普遍开展地雷爆炸运动。二、迅速整顿各村民兵，组成游击小组，乘青纱帐起开展麻雀战，打击顽、伪小股出扰与便衣特务。并加强联防，村与村密切联系，互相支援。三、各据点周围村庄民兵严密包围据点。老区山边村庄民兵组织轮防，戒备山口并协助围困附近之顽、伪据点。四、地方基干武装以连为单位在各区警戒时，连长与政指均参加区指挥部，领导当地民兵一致行动。五、整顿情报网，务使迅速确实。"

During the liberation of Dai and Guo counties, every day there were groups of 300 to 400 stretchers spontaneously gathered by the masses moving along with the troops, and at most, more than 1,000 stretchers were concentrated. During the liberation of Fanshi, more than 1,500 militiamen from the newly liberated areas rushed to the front line overnight, climbing up the city walls on cloud ladders together with the main force, personally capturing the traitors who had oppressed and ravaged them. Transportation stations were set up every fifty li in various places, and as soon as the wounded arrived, they were transferred in relays day and night. Countless temporary comfort stations were also established in various large and small villages and towns. When the stretchers arrived, women and children waiting by the village would scramble to stuff eggs, pancakes, and cigarettes to the wounded soldiers, and deliver soup and water to wash their faces and hands. Little girl Han Fengxiang's father was captured and buried alive in the city by the puppet bandit Qiao Richeng in May of this year. She used her private money to buy many cigarettes and eggs and put them in her pockets, waiting all day long by the village to comfort the passing wounded soldiers, and automatically changing medicine for them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 同蒲路北段人民热烈协助自卫战\n\n1946-08-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　同蒲路北段人民热烈协助自卫战\n    【新华社张家口十四日电】同蒲路北段人民，热情协助八路军进行自卫战，解放代、崞两县时，每日均有群众自动集拢起的三四百付担架随车移动，最多时曾集中到一千多付。解放繁峙时，新解放区民兵一千五百余名，彻夜赶赴前线，和主力一同攀登云梯上城，亲手捕捉欺压蹂躏他们的奸逆。各地每隔五十里均设有交通站，伤兵一到立刻不分昼夜递次转送。各大小村镇，更成立了无数的临时慰劳站，当担架到时，聚集在村边等候的妇女儿童，便争先将鸡蛋、烙饼、纸烟塞给伤兵们，并递汤喂水给伤兵洗脸洗手。小姑娘韩凤祥的父，是今年五月被伪匪乔日成捕入城内活埋的，他用体己钱买了许多纸烟、鸡蛋放在口袋里，终日在村边上等候着慰劳过路伤员，并自动为伤兵换药。"

Later, they received a reply from Wang Shijie through Shao Lizi, sophistically claiming that each country attending the conference was limited to one representative, rejecting the request. The CCP delegation, Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, wrote to the Kuomintang representatives again on July 31st, refuting the claim with reason and insisting that the Chinese delegation to the Paris Peace Conference should include representatives from all parties and non-party figures. The Kuomintang authorities, realizing that their arguments were untenable, delayed their response. The CCP delegation then sent another letter on August 5th to inquire. The two letters are transcribed below:\n\n(1) Mr. Lizi,\n    I have received your and Mr. Xueting’s reply of July 20th with respect. It has been verified that all countries attending this Paris Conference are sending delegations, and even our country is sending a delegation, not just one foreign minister. The statement in the reply that each country attending the conference is limited to one representative is clearly not true. If Enlai and others were to inquire with the convening countries about this matter, their answers would also contradict the reply. Our party believes that this conference is of great significance, so it proposed that the government send representatives from all parties and non-party figures, intending to demonstrate the cooperation of all parties in our country to the world. At a time when the civil war is increasingly expanding, the world powers are watching our measures to stop the dispute, but your party has completely monopolized the representatives attending the European conference, showing the world a one-party dictatorship. Our party has no other avenue to pursue, and we still hope to be allowed to attend in accordance with the current method of representation for countries attending the conference, in order to show unity. I believe you will understand my sincerity. I respectfully ask you to forward this to Chairman Chiang for reconsideration, which is my sincere prayer! Please reply. With respectful regards!\n\n    Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, July 31st\n\n(2) Mr. Lizi,\n    On July 31st, Enlai and others again requested the government to send representatives from our party to attend the Paris Peace Conference, which was forwarded by you. Almost a week has passed, but we have not received a reply. The government's attitude towards this matter is still unclear. Delaying the response will inevitably delay the conference, and if the opportunity is missed, there will be no regrets! I do not hesitate to write again to present the situation.

As of the 4th of this month, the water level in the southern section of the canal had risen to one zhang, four chi, and one cun, which is one cun higher than the level requiring defense, and there is concern that continuous heavy rains will cause it to rise further. Therefore, the Construction Department of the Suwan Border Government and the Southern Canal Project Office have been carrying out full-scale defense work since August 1st; the Second Special District Office has also issued \"Emergency Dike Protection Measures\"; and the Party committees and governments at all levels along the dike are personally leading the masses to defend with all their strength. In the Jieshou to Shaobo section alone, there are thirteen work sheds and felt sheds, staffed by three people with rich experience in canal engineering, cooperating with the Jiangdu-Gaoyou Dike Protection Brigade, patrolling and guarding day and night. The section south of Shaobo, because it is often harassed by Chiang's troops, is guarded by the New Fourth Army stationed in Shaobo. Furthermore, on the 30th of last month, more than 2,000 people in the Huhe district of Suqian-Zhuang county, seeing that the water level of the Yi River within their territory was high and almost level with the dike, rushed to reinforce the dike, digging more than a thousand cubic meters of soil overnight, until the river water stopped rising.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党堵塞运河归江各坝  运河水势不断上涨  我沿堤党政人员亲率群众加紧设防\n\n1946-08-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党堵塞运河归江各坝\n    运河水势不断上涨       \n    我沿堤党政人员亲率群众加紧设防\n    【新华社淮阴十五日电】扬州国民党当局，仍继续阻塞运河归江各坝，坚不开启，致使运河水势因淮沂伏泛上涨不已，无法宣泄。截至本月四日，运河南段水位已涨达一丈四尺一寸，比应防设水位犹高出一寸，且连日大雨尚有续涨之虑。为此，苏皖边府建设厅、运河南段工程事务所，自八月一日起即进行全线设防；二专署并颁布“紧急护堤办法”；沿堤各级党委政府，均亲自领导群众全力防守。仅界首至邵伯一段，即设有十三个工防棚毡棚，由三名富有运河工程经验人员配合江（都）高（邮）护堤大队，不分昼夜巡逻守卫。邵伯以南一段，因常受蒋军袭扰，由驻邵伯新四军担任护卫。又上月三十日，宿（迁）壮县护河区群众二千余，以境内沂水水位高涨，几与河堤相平，抢着增修河堤，一夜间扒土千余方，直至河水停涨。"

    "date": "1946-08-18",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The Taihang People's Armed Forces are Unprecedentedly Strong\n\tYang Diankui\n\nIn the counter-offensive and the subsequent vigorous mass movement, the militia in our region has experienced an unprecedented and rapid development in the past year. Currently, the total number of militia in the region has reached 200,000, with new developments accounting for 72 percent of the number at the start of the counter-offensive. If we add the self-defense forces, the total number of people's armed forces in the region has reached one million. The fastest development has been in northern Henan, exceeding more than four times the number during the counter-offensive. This development is mainly in the newly liberated areas.\n\nThe number of militia weapons has also increased significantly, with the number of rifles and horses increasing by 163 percent compared to the time of the counter-offensive. The sources include those captured during the counter-offensive and self-defense operations, and the remainder are weapons confiscated from reactionary landlords, despots, bandits, and secret agents during the mass movement, or purchased with the fruits of the struggle. Explosive weapons, homemade guns, and cannons are also being developed in the newly liberated areas. To defend the fruits of their liberation, the masses are taking up various weapons to arm themselves. For example, in northern Henan, where \"steel gun-ism\" has always prevailed, some liberated farmers have also taken up homemade guns and cannons that have been buried for many years.\n\nThe development of the militia can generally be divided into the following three situations:\n\nThe first type is the transformation and expansion of underground armies: Before the counter-offensive, Xingtai, Shahe, Zuoquan, Xiyang, Lucheng, Changzhi, Cixian and other places had underground army organizations. Under the bloody rule of enemy and puppet secret agents, they persisted in underground struggles for a long time and created countless moving deeds. For example, the underground army in Cixian once forced an enemy driver to destroy a locomotive in broad daylight, and once captured and killed more than 30 traitors and secret agents in one month. The underground army in Lucheng independently recovered the Japanese stronghold of Wulihou during the counter-offensive. Enemy and puppet secret agents spared no effort in terrorizing and destroying them due to their fear and hatred. In Cixian, more than 110 people were once captured by the enemy, and only 20 or 30 survived. When the counter-offensive arrived, these underground armies, in coordination with our army and the militia in the old areas, cooperated internally and externally. After recovering large areas of territory, they immediately and automatically transformed into open militia, established an anti-Japanese order, and launched anti-traitor liquidation struggles. They have made great achievements for the nation and the people. Because they were organized during the anti-Japanese struggle and have long been in a state of secrecy and dispersion, they lack education and their class consciousness is not high. There are also some hooligan elements. After being tortured by long-term underground struggles, they inevitably consider themselves meritorious, acting arbitrarily, and despise other cadres and work, such as competing for leadership in the rent reduction and interest reduction struggle. However, after the commendation and grievance campaigns awakened their class consciousness, most of them actively participated in the liberation movement. Many of them became activists, and the movement also absorbed new activists to participate and expand the organization. Only a few degenerates who were bought and used by landlords and secret agents were eliminated in the movement.\n\nThe second type is the masses in the newly liberated areas, inspired by the counter-offensive situation and the demands of participating in the war, organized from top to bottom after simple anti-Japanese mobilization work. They temporarily assumed the task of assisting the army and maintaining order in the village. However, because the masses have not been seriously mobilized, there are many speculators, and many are hired by the village with money, with complex components. A considerable number are local ruffians, hooligans, and soldiers of fortune, especially the leadership components, which are mostly controlled by landlords and despots, and some are even transferred from puppet self-government cadres. These elements doubt our militia policy, and are seriously afraid of change, afraid of participating in the war, and afraid of being incorporated into the army. These militia, except for those completely controlled by landlords and secret agents, were resolutely disarmed by the masses. Generally, they were transformed through the test and review of the mass movement struggle, absorbing new activists and changing the leadership components. In some places, they were first subjected to political rectification of the militia, and then transformed through mass struggle.\n\nThe third type is completely newly established from the mass movement.\n\nRegardless of the situation, their common feature is that they have been developed and strengthened through close integration with the mass movement and the masses, constituting the main component of the peasant liberation movement. Arming the masses is an important link in the mass movement, especially in the northern Henan area and the border areas, where the armed rule of landlords, despots, secret agents, stubborn puppets, and bandits in one, black guns and assassinations, and armed attacks seriously threaten the masses.\n\nThis process of arming the masses can also be divided into: 1. First, there are armed activists: Before there are peasant association militia organizations, several activists secretly take up weapons, or with the support of foreign militia and troops, seize the landlord's armed forces, and then collude with the masses to brew struggles. 2. Gradually form armed peasant associations: Because there are armed forces, the masses dare to follow, the peasant association is organized, and the number of people carrying guns increases. Almost all cadres and activists have guns, forming a situation where the peasant association carries guns. 3. Finally, it develops into the armed forces of the peasant association: When there is a peasant association in the village, the movement is increasingly carried out, and more and more people carry guns. Gradually, from the armed liberation group, armed members, and home self-defense team of the peasant association, a formal militia is formed, which is still under the direct control and leadership of the peasant association. They are responsible for suppressing black gun assassinations, armed attacks and riots, correcting the activities of illegal landlords, despots and secret agents, protecting cadres, activists, protecting the peasant association, and protecting the liberation struggle and liberation interests.\n\nThe militia in the old areas supported the struggles in the border areas and directly supported the liberation movement in the new areas. In this period of mass movement alone, Bo'ai has repelled more than 40 attacks by armed secret agents and bandits, and captured 66 bandits, secret agents and traitors alive.\n\nIn the Shanxi area, the threat of black gun assassinations is not as serious as in northern Henan, but due to the result of the masses going through eight years of armed rule by enemies, puppets, stubborn elements, and secret agents, coupled with the constant attacks by Yan and puppets in the border areas, and the influence of the militia in the old areas, the masses also generally demanded armed forces and organized militia during the movement. However, it generally developed in large numbers after the establishment of peasant associations and the rent reduction and interest reduction movement. In short, the new feature is that the organization is generally combined with the peasant association, directly under the control and leadership of the peasant association, serving the interests of peasant liberation, completely correcting the past purely armed viewpoint that was separated from the mass movement and the premature emphasis on the independent establishment of the militia.\n\nIn the future, the main tasks of the militia work in the new areas are to absorb more peasant association members to participate under the call of combining the deepening of the mass movement and the preparation for self-defense war and protecting the interests of liberation, to use the most loyal and reliable pure peasant backbone as militia cadres, and to conduct general review and education in the militia, to carry out anti-traitor struggles, to continue to rectify the organization, to eliminate the traitors and secret agents who have infiltrated, to improve their class consciousness and armed consciousness, to draw a clear line between the old and new armed forces, so that they will not degenerate, not be usurped, and become more consolidated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行人民武装空前强大\n杨殿魁\n1946-08-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行人民武装空前强大\n    杨殿魁\n    在反攻和以后轰轰烈烈的群运中，一年来我区民兵，有空前猛烈的发展。现全区民兵已达二十万，新发展数为反攻开始的百分之七十二。如加上自卫队，则全区人民武装已达百万。发展最快的为豫北，超过反攻时的四倍多。这个发展主要在新区。\n    民兵的武器增加也很多，步马枪增加数为反攻时的百分之一百六十三。其来源除在反攻与自卫作战中缴获者外，余均为群运中解除之反动地主、恶霸、土匪、特务的武器，或用斗争果实购买的。新区的爆炸武器和土枪、土炮，也正在发展，群众为保卫翻身果实，拿起各种武器来武装自己。如一向盛行“钢枪主义”的豫北，翻身的农民有的也拿起了多年埋藏的土枪、土炮。\n    民兵的发展，一般可以分为下述三种情况：\n    第一种是地下军转化扩大的：反攻之前，邢台、沙河、左权、昔阳、潞城、长治、磁县等地均有地下军之组织，他们在敌伪特务血腥统治下，长期坚持了地下斗争，创造无数可歌可泣的事迹。如磁县地下军，曾于白天强迫敌司机将火车头炸坏，曾在一个月中捕杀过汉奸特务三十余人。潞城地下军，曾于反攻时，单独收复了五里堠日军据点。敌伪特务对他们的恐怖仇恨，摧残也不遗余力。磁县曾有一次被敌捕去一百一十多人，只有二、三十人生还。这些地下军反攻到来，配合我军与老区民兵，里应外合，收复大块国土后，立即自动转化为公开民兵，建立起抗日秩序，展开反奸清算斗争。他们于民族于人民有其丰功伟绩。由于是抗日斗争中组织起来的，长期处于秘密分散的状态，缺乏教育工作，阶级觉悟不高，还有一些流氓成份，经长期地下斗争的折磨，一旦解放，不免自居有功，独断独行，轻视其他干部与工作，如在减租减息斗争中争领导权等现象。但经过表功和诉苦运动，唤醒其阶级自觉后，他们大部便积极参加了翻身运动。许多并成为积极分子，运动中又吸取了新的积极分子参加，组织扩大。只有个别被地主特务收买利用的蜕化分子，在运动中被淘汰了。\n    第二种是新解放区群众在反攻形势鼓舞与参战任务要求之下，经过简单的抗日发动工作，自上而下组织起来的。临时担负协助军队与维持村内秩序。但因群众尚未认真发动，投机者多，不少是村中出钱雇的，成份复杂，相当大的数量为地痞、流氓、兵油子，特别是领导成份，大部为地主恶霸所掌握，有的甚至是伪自卫国干部转任的。这些分子，怀疑我民兵政策，严重的怕变天、怕参战、怕编兵。这些民兵在群运中，除完全为地主特务掌握者，经过群众坚决解除其武装外，一般是经过群运斗争的考验审查加以改造，吸收新的积极分子，改换领导成份。有的地方则是先经过民兵的政治整训，再经过群众斗争改造的。\n    第三种是完全从群运中新建立的。\n    不论那种情况，其共同的特点，都是经过群运与群众紧密结合发展壮大起来的，构成农民翻身运动的主要组成部分，武装群众为群运的重要环节，特别是豫北地区与边沿地区，在地主、恶霸、特务、顽伪、土匪数位一体的武装统治之下，黑枪暗杀，武装袭击，严重的威胁着群众。\n    这种武装群众的过程也可分为：一、首先有武装的积极分子：在没有农会民兵组织以前，先由几个积极分子秘密拿起武器，或在外来民兵、军队支援下，夺取地主武装，再串通群众酝酿斗争。二、逐渐形成武装的农会：由于有了武装，群众敢跟着走，农会组织起来了，背枪的人增多，差不多干部、积极分子都枪不离身，形成农会带枪的局面。三、最后发展为农会的武装：村中有了农会，运动日益开展，带枪的也越来越多，逐渐由农会的武装翻身组、武装会员、保家自卫队等名称，组成正式的民兵，仍在农会的直接掌握领导下，担负镇压黑枪暗杀，武装袭击暴动，纠察非法地主恶霸特务的活动，保卫干部，积极分子，保卫农会，保卫翻身斗争与翻身利益。\n    老区民兵，支援边地斗争，直接支援新区的翻身运动。仅博爱在这一段群运中，便打退武装特务土匪的袭击在四十多次以上，活捉土匪特务汉奸达六十六名。\n    在山西地区，黑枪暗杀威胁虽不如豫北严重，但由于群众经过八年敌、伪、顽、特武装统治的结果，加上阎、伪在边地的不断袭击，及老区的民兵影响，群众在运动中，也普遍要求武装，组织民兵。不过一般是在有了农会与减租减息运动中才大量发展的。总之，新的特点，是在组织上普遍与农会结合在一起，直接由农会掌握领导，为农民翻身利益而服务，完全纠正了过去离开群运的单纯武装观点与过早的强调民兵单独成立的。\n    今后新区民兵工作的主要任务，在结合群运的深入与自卫战准备、保卫翻身利益的号召下，更大批的吸收农会会员参加，以最忠实可靠的纯洁农民骨干当民兵干部，并在民兵中普遍进行审查和教育，开展反奸斗争，继续整顿组织，为清除混入的奸特分子，提高其阶级自觉与武装自觉，划清新旧武装界限，使其不致蜕化，不致被篡夺，更加巩固起来。"

On July 23rd, the Chiang troops stationed on the border of Xiuwu and Wuzhi launched a large-scale encirclement of Ji Meng Village in Xiuwu at night, blocking all passages into the village with six machine guns. The village militia and self-defense force fought bravely, but were eventually forced to disperse and hide due to overwhelming odds. At that time, three militiamen and five self-defense members sought refuge in the home of Old Mrs. Qiu. The Chiang troops discovered this, chased them into the Qiu house to search, and severely tortured Old Mrs. Qiu, demanding information. However, this old woman, over sixty years old, though covered in wounds, did not utter a single word. The Chiang troops, enraged with shame, shot and killed Old Mrs. Qiu, then looted and howled away. The entire village was moved to tears by the heroic death of Old Mrs. Qiu. On the 25th, the entire village held a funeral and public memorial service for Old Mrs. Qiu, with utmost sorrow and honor. All the militiamen and self-defense members swore an oath at Old Mrs. Qiu's grave: to defend their homes to the death, to strike at the Chiang puppets, and to avenge Old Mrs. Qiu.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 威武不屈英烈可风  修武县府表扬邱老太太\n\n1946-08-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　威武不屈英烈可风\n    修武县府表扬邱老太太\n    【本报长治讯】修武县政府，顷明令表扬姬孟村邱老太太。七月二十三日，驻修武、武陟边境蒋军，于夜间大举包围修武之姬孟村，并以六挺机枪封锁村庄所有通路。该村民兵自卫队奋勇抵御，终因众寡悬殊，被迫分散隐蔽。当时有民兵三人，自卫队员五人，避入邱老太太家中，为蒋军发觉追入邱家搜索，并严刑拷打逼问邱老太太，而此六十余高龄的老人，虽遍体鳞伤，卒未吐一词。蒋军脑羞成怒，当将邱老太太击毙，抢掠呼啸而去。全村群众对邱老太太英勇的惨死，感激流泪，二十五日全村为邱老太太发丧，举行公祭公葬，备极哀荣。全体民兵、自卫队员，在邱老太太坟前宣誓：誓死保卫家乡，打击蒋伪，为邱老太太复仇。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on Chiang Kai-shek's letter to the compatriots nationwide on the 13th, saying: Every time a holiday comes, out comes a Chiang Kai-shek's \"eight-legged essay\" filled with lies, shameless, smelly and long, which is truly a disgrace to the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek's demobilization is \"demobilizing\" the people to starvation, \"demobilizing\" national industries to closure, \"demobilizing\" China to a colony, \"demobilizing\" the entire country to civil war, \"demobilizing\" politics to overt and covert assassinations, \"demobilizing\" 85 percent of the army to fight the liberated areas, \"demobilizing\" Yunnan troops to the Northeast, \"demobilizing\" Southern troops to the North to fight civil war, and \"demobilizing\" tens of thousands of officers from miscellaneous and non-Zhejiang origins to beg on the streets. This is what Chiang Kai-shek calls \"resolutely not abandoning his responsibility to safeguard national administrative sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people.\" Wherever Chiang Kai-shek's transportation can reach, he can most thoroughly carry out this kind of \"demobilization\" work of killing, cannibalizing, economic collapse, and colonization. And the reason why he demands that his transportation be unimpeded is to transport his troops to achieve all his \"demobilization\" i.e. the purpose of civil war. Chiang Kai-shek's \"usual democratic method\" is a \"fascist republic\" style of democracy like the Japanese Emperor plus Hitler plus Mussolini. The manifestation of this kind of democracy is nineteen years of civil war, killing like hemp, the Kunming Massacre, the Jiaochangkou Massacre, and the assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, etc. Only by abolishing his kind of \"democracy,\" that is to say, abolishing the fascist oligarchy dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic capital group, can there be true democracy. Chiang Kai-shek has the \"responsibility\" to maintain his own fascist oligarchy dictatorship and oppose the people's demands for peace and democracy. If Chiang Kai-shek insists on this to the end, then the Chinese people also have the responsibility to abolish Chiang Kai-shek's fascist oligarchy dictatorship and realize the people's democracy. The Chinese people must have the right to eat and the right to speak. The Chinese Communist Party will definitely stand with the people to the end and never retreat. Chiang Kai-shek, remember this well, if he dares to act arbitrarily, insists on having the people in the liberated areas massacred by you, insists on having the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continue to starve to death by the millions, insists on having democratic people throughout the country assassinated and openly killed by you, insists on a fascist dictatorial constitution, insists on convening a one-party-dominated pseudo-\"National Assembly\" prepared to transition from fascist tutelage to fascist \"constitutional government,\" then the people will definitely have ways to abolish all of this. Chiang Kai-shek also told American reporters on April 9, \"I have made up my mind to eliminate the Communist Party.\" Before going to Lushan this time, Chiang Kai-shek once said, \"Watch me succeed in suppressing the Communists within a year,\" but he did not dare to say this publicly in the letter to the people. Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly sabotaged the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and ignored the repeated proposals not to hold the PCC. Chiang Kai-shek deleted the four characters \"army reorganization\" from the \"Basic Plan for Army Reorganization and Unification of the Communist Army into the National Army\" and only demanded the implementation of the \"Plan for Unifying the Communist Army into the National Army.\" These are all called \"adhering to the agreement.\" Chiang Kai-shek does not dare to mention the Northeast Truce Agreement of March 27, does not dare to mention the four promises he himself made, and does not dare to mention the great famine and economic collapse under the rule of the Kuomintang. The reason why Chiang Kai-shek is doing this is a manifestation of a guilty conscience and a manifestation of a deep crisis. In order to oppose the people, in order to pursue civil war and dictatorship, Chiang Kai-shek has given away various sovereign rights of China to American imperialism in order to obtain foreign aid. He thinks this is his \"success.\" However, Chiang Kai-shek and his murderous and cannibalistic heinous government are extremely isolated throughout the country and are being opposed by the people of the whole country. Relying on his foreign daddy alone will not work! The Xinhua News Agency reporter said: Chiang Kai-shek is already sixty years old. How much national sovereignty has he sold? How many of his own compatriots has he killed? How much has he made from national crises and non-national crises? What do the Chinese people think of Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang government? Don't Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk understand this?! At the Political Consultative Conference, the democratic parties were magnanimous and wanted to allow Chiang Kai-shek to have a good end. As long as he turned over a new leaf, he could be forgiven for the past. He lightly abandoned this good opportunity and was determined to drill into the cesspool. It is truly regrettable!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新华社记者评蒋介石谎言骗人\n\n1946-08-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新华社记者评蒋介石谎言骗人\n    【新华社延安十五日电】新华社记者评蒋介石十三日告全国同胞书说：每逢一个节日，就出来一篇满纸谎言无耻又臭又长的蒋八股，实是中国人民的耻辱。蒋介石的复员，是拿人民“复”到饿死，把民族工业“复”到关门，把中国“复”到殖民地，是把全国“复”到内战，把政治“复”到明杀与暗杀，是把百分之八十五的军队“复”来打解放区，把云南军队“复”到东北，把南方军队“复”到北方打内战，把杂牌的和非浙江人的军官成千成万“复”到街头去讨饭。这些就是蒋介石所说“决不能放弃其维护国家行政主权与保护人民生命财产安全的责任”。凡是蒋介石的交通所能够到达的地方，他就能够把这种杀人、吃人、经济崩溃、殖民地化的“复员”工作做得最为彻底。而他所以要求他的交通畅通，就是为的运送他的军队，以达到他这一切“复员”即内战之目的。蒋介石的“通常民主方式”，是日本天皇加希特勒加墨索里尼“法西斯共合国”式的“民主方式”。这种民主的表现，就是十九年的内战，就是杀人如麻，就是昆明惨案，较场口惨案和李闻暗杀案等等。只有取消他的这种“民主”，即是说，取消蒋介石官僚资本集团的法西斯寡头独裁，才会有真正的民主。蒋介石有“责任”维持他自己的法西斯寡头独裁和反对人民的和平民主要求，这一点蒋介石坚持到底，中国人民就也有责任去取消蒋介石的法西斯寡头独裁和实现人民的民主。中国人民一定要有饭吃的权利，说话的权利。这一点中国共产党一定与人民一起坚持到底，决不后退。蒋介石牢牢记住吧，如果他敢于一意孤行，一定要解放区的人民受你屠杀，一定要国民党统治区的人民成百万的继续饿死，一定要全国民主人士受你暗杀和明杀，一定要一个法西斯独裁宪法，一定要召开一党包办、准备由法西斯训政到实行法西斯“宪政”的伪“国民大会”，那么人民是一定有办法去取消这一切的。蒋介石还在四月九日就对美国记者说：“我已经下决心消灭共产党”。蒋介石此次上庐山之前，曾经表示“一年内看我剿共成功”，可是在告民众书里不敢公开这样说。蒋介石一连串的破坏政协决议，连续不再开政协的提议也不理，蒋介石把“关于军队整编及统编中共军队为国军之基本方案”，删去了“军队整编”四字，只要求执行“统编共军为国军的方案”，这些都叫作“信守协议”。蒋介石不敢提三月二十七日的东北停战协议，不敢提他自己亲口说的四项诺言，不敢提国民党统治下的大饥荒和经济崩溃。蒋介石所以如此，是作贼心虚的表现，是危机深重的表现。蒋介石为着反对人民，为着内战与独裁，把中国各种主权断送给美国帝国主义，以取得外援，他认为这是他的“得计”。但是，蒋介石和他的这个杀人吃人的万恶政府，在全国已极端孤立，正遭受到全国人民的反对，光靠洋爸爸也不顶事！新华社记者说：蒋介石已经六十岁了，卖了多少国家主权，杀了多少自己的同胞，发了多少国难财和非国难财，中国人民对蒋介石和蒋政府作何感想，难道蒋介石等辈还不明白？！政治协商会议上，各民主党派宽大为怀，想让蒋介石得个善终，只要他革面洗心，就可以不咎既往，此种良机轻轻抛弃下，决心要往粪坑里钻，真是不胜遗憾之至！"

Last month, on the 13th, Chiang's army officers of the 91st and 92nd Regiments of the 31st Division who laid down their arms in the battle of Ruzhang, Wenxi, recently issued an open letter to the Nationalist army soldiers and officers attacking the Jinan Liberated Area, calling on them to stage battlefield uprisings and join hands with the Eighth Route Army to oppose the civil war. The signatories include Liang Zangwei, lieutenant colonel and deputy head of the 92nd Regiment, Lin Yongkang, lieutenant colonel and deputy head of the 91st Regiment, Lin Yongmeng, lieutenant colonel and battalion commander, Liu Shangwen, major and battalion commander, Chen Yunqiao, major and regimental adjutant, Li Youchen, major and battalion commander, Shen Zhenwen, captain and deputy battalion commander of the 92nd Regiment, Wen Tela, captain and battalion adjutant, Ni Xiafei, captain and battalion adjutant, and Li Yichang, captain and company commander, among 16 officers. The letter stated: \"After the victory against Japan, we should have returned home to demobilize, but unexpectedly, under the deception and coercion of Chiang Kai-shek, we crossed the river to attack the Liberated Areas and the Eighth Route Army, causing the flames of civil war to spread across the land and our dear compatriots to suffer catastrophe. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have wives and daughters? Our conscience is not dead, and we are unwilling to use the guns and cannons of American imperialism to slaughter our own compatriots. We are determined to lay down our butcher knives and throw ourselves into the embrace of the people, and we have received the enthusiastic love and care of the elders and brothers in the Liberated Areas. Now that the fierce battle in Jinan has started again, we dare to ask you, our comrades-in-arms, to make a permanent plan for your own future and for the survival of the nation, and to learn from generals such as Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, and Wang Haiqing, to stage battlefield uprisings, to join hands closely with the Eighth Route Army, to oppose the civil war, to strive for peace, and to build an independent, democratic, and free new China.\"\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 15th] More than 400 Chiang's army soldiers who laid down their arms in the Taixing and Rugao battles held an anti-civil war accusation meeting in a certain place in central Jiangsu on the 28th of last month. Attendees included soldiers and wounded from the 28th Division, the 19th Division, and the 99th Division (now all renamed brigades). Liu Junting, a soldier of the 26th Division, said: \"Brothers only get two meals a day, and three taels are deducted from 25 taels of grain, forcing everyone to work on an empty stomach; the officers not only eat from the fake roster but also deduct our salaries. 6,000 yuan was deducted in May, and the rubber shoe fee was also deducted to do business and get rich, forcing us to go to the front line to die. This time, when we came to northern Jiangsu, they lied to us, saying that we could go home after eliminating the 'bandits'. Now we know that we have been fooled.\" Another private said: \"We are unwilling to fight the civil war. The officers lied to us, saying that the New Fourth Army are 'bandits' and that we would be skinned alive if we were caught. But we have been here for more than ten days, and the New Fourth Army treats us like brothers. Not only have we not been skinned alive, but our wounds have been healed.\" They cited many facts to prove that Chiang Kai-shek colluded with the American reactionaries and employed American troops to support the civil war. There were four American officers in the 99th Division, and American officers often went to speak when the 26th Division was in Nantong. They all said in unison: \"Chiang Kai-shek is a dictator who gives sovereignty to foreigners and wants to be a puppet emperor.

At dawn on June 2nd, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Wuqing surrounded Fenglin Village, driving all the villagers to the wheat threshing ground at the edge of the village, shouting wildly for the militia captain to be handed over. The villagers huddled together, and no one spoke. Chiang's military officers dragged out four or five young men from the crowd and beat them with gun butts. Women and children covered their faces, and the whole place was quiet. Still, no one uttered a word. The Chiang troops became enraged and set up machine guns in front of the crowd. A bloody massacre was about to begin. The old father of the militia captain, Li Baozhu, disregarding everyone's obstruction, squeezed to the front and said loudly, \"My son is the militia captain, and he and his team have already moved away.\" Chiang's officers and soldiers grinned and tied the gray-haired old man to the nearby Tang'erli stronghold. On Tang'erli Street, a special agent named Feng asked him, \"Aren't you the chairman of the Farmers' Association in Fenglin Village? You even reduced rent, didn't you?\" \"It should be reduced!\" Li Baozhu answered firmly. The Chiang and puppet troops and local tyrants interrogated him with cruel torture. Li Baozhu died several times from the bloody beatings. The Chiang troops even used pliers to pull out the beard on his face, and blood covered both cheeks, but he never yielded. The special agents could not extract any information about the militia from him. After a few days, \"Father of the Militia\" Li Baozhu was finally rescued from the prison by the soldiers.

More than twenty administrative villages have established self-defense groups combining war preparedness and anti-treachery measures, and are extensively carrying out a movement to confess to being a KMT spy. The Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on US military aid, are prolonging the civil war front, universally arousing the blazing fire of mass anger. The masses are all saying: \"Yan is a branch, Chiang is the trunk, they cannot live without the old American root; we have only achieved a small emancipation now, and to achieve a great emancipation we must resist the Chinese and foreign reactionaries.\" The militiamen have all made up their minds to shed blood to defend the fruits of emancipation; they are not selling the coffins they obtained from the struggle to offset debts, generously saying: \"Emancipation requires struggle, self-defense requires bloodshed, let's keep the coffins for our own use!\" Self-defense groups (which are also wartime evacuation groups) in villages such as Fuche and Fandian have conducted war preparedness exercises, ensuring that when war comes, they will not encumber the militiamen, allowing the militiamen to concentrate on fighting on the front lines. The self-defense mobilization and confession movement, which began on July 2nd, started in villages such as Beiguan and Xiyan. The peasant association and activists are conducting mobilization door-to-door and in large gatherings. They put forward the idea that \"without a bottom line for theives, it is difficult to move forward,\" and \"We are not afraid of outside KMT spies, but only of local bad people.\" After mass discussion, a self-defense covenant was established, guaranteeing: not to do bad things, not to harbor bad people, not to contact bad people, and to pay attention to KMT spy activities. Then, people voluntarily joined together, mutually guaranteeing, and those with problems had to confess and repent before they could participate in the self-defense group. The Quántóu natural village established a self-defense group during war mobilization. One woman reported that her husband had been in contact with the traitor Chen Zǐwén in the past, had led Chen's troops to Quántóu to kill people, and persuaded her husband to confess. With the masses' forgiveness and leniency, he participated in the self-defense group.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaibei, 12th—Major General Xi Shengkai, Deputy Division Commander of the Chiang Army’s 92nd Division, who laid down his arms in the Chaoyangji battle of Yugou County, Suining, east of the Jinpu Railway in Huaibei last month on the 25th, recently expressed his thoughts to a reporter from this agency. Xi stated: “I feel extremely pained by participating in this meaningless civil war. Now that I am an ordinary citizen who has left the battlefield and laid down my arms, I feel relieved. Here, I would like to express my personal feelings as a citizen. After the Political Consultative Conference, our country could have embarked on peaceful construction, but due to the insistence of a few people in the Kuomintang on dictatorship, attempting to rule China as ‘Party Emperors,’ especially the actions of the two Chens (Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu), the two Gus (Gu Zhenggang, Gu Zhengding), Liang Han Cao, and others in attempting to overturn the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference at the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, were even more obvious. After the Second Plenary Session, I personally believed that the country would be troubled from then on, and civil war would be unavoidable. My division was ordered to depart from Wuxi lightly armed. I repeatedly requested retirement to care for my 78-year-old mother, but was not granted permission. Soon after arriving in Suxian, I was ordered to attack the New Fourth Army to the east. At this point, my division was plunged into the vortex of civil war, but I personally was extremely unwilling to participate in the civil war. During the Yugou battle, when I heard the sound of civil war gunfire, my mood immediately plummeted. Chief of Staff Liu asked me about the army's advance or retreat. I immediately advocated staying in place. When the order was disrupted, the guards asked how we should handle it. I immediately ordered us to lay down our arms. Most of the officers and soldiers in my division were extremely diligent in the War of Resistance against Japan and were awarded the four characters ‘hold the position and do not retreat.’ The main reason for laying down arms this time was that the officers and soldiers were tired of war and unwilling to make meaningless sacrifices. Everyone asked for retirement during the reorganization, and this time they finally found an opportunity to go home. As for the dark and corrupt domestic politics (referring to the Kuomintang-controlled areas), I had long been dissatisfied with them. The Kuomintang had long lost its revolutionary spirit after the Northern Expedition. Under the control of the two Chens, the two Gus, and a group of ‘Party Emperors,’ the bureaucracy was corrupt, corruption was rampant, secret agents were everywhere, industry was devastated, and the people were living in poverty. Recently, they have even gone so far as to sell out customs and navigation rights in exchange for military aid, allowing Americans to rampage everywhere, with American goods flooding the market, like the Japanese invaders before the war. I have long been pessimist about the future of the Kuomintang, believing that the Kuomintang authorities have abandoned the legacy of the Premier in the past ten years and more, and it is no longer worthy of being called a political party, but merely a tyrannical group of a few people. And today, the worldwide trend is towards peace and democracy, which will never allow one-party dictatorship, let alone civil war to consume national power. The Kuomintang's civil war policy is simply a policy of suicide and self-destruction. From the perspective of economic, financial, food, and human resource mobilization, the Kuomintang-controlled areas have reached a state of financial exhaustion, food depletion, and exhaustion of soldiers and people, and cannot support a long-term civil war. On the other hand, the Liberated Areas mobilize the masses to implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of 'land to the tiller,' and the army and people are united in stepping up production and construction. This kind of force cannot be destroyed by any weapon. I advocate the immediate establishment of a coalition government of all parties and factions to jointly discuss national affairs. I believe that if there is a coalition government composed of representatives of all parties, factions, circles, and armies across the country, China will not fight a civil war again. Now I hope that the people of the whole country will unite as one and quickly stop the tragedy of a few people massacring the majority of the people!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋军副师长洗盛楷  畅谈参加内战苦衷  痛斥国民党统治黑暗腐败\n\n1946-08-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋军副师长洗盛楷\n    畅谈参加内战苦衷\n    痛斥国民党统治黑暗腐败\n    【新华社淮北十二日电】上月二十五日在淮北津浦路东睢宁县渔沟朝阳集战役中放下武器之蒋军九十二师副师长洗盛楷少将顷对本社记者发表感想。洗氏表示：“此次参加无谓之内战，内心极感痛苦。现在已是离开战场放下武器的老百姓了，倒觉得轻松。在此愿以国民资格谈谈个人各种感慨。从政治协商会议以后，我国本可进行和平建设，但由于国民党少数人坚持独裁，企图假‘党皇帝’统治中国，特别是二陈（陈果夫、陈立夫）二谷（谷正纲、谷正鼎）梁寒操等在国民党二中全会上企图推翻政协决议，更为明显。二中全会以后，个人认为国家从此多事，内战必不可免，本师奉命从无锡轻装出发，个人屡请退伍，奉侍七十八岁老母，均未得准。到宿县不久，复奉命向东进攻新四军，至此本师即陷入内战漩涡，但本人心内极不愿参加内战，此次渔沟战役中，听到内战枪声一响，我心绪即降到冰点。刘参谋长问我军进退如何？我即主张留在原地。当秩序紊乱时，卫士问我们如何处理？我即下令放下武器。本师中大多数官兵在抗战中均极奋勉，曾被奖以‘守阵不退’四字，此次放下武器的主要原因是官兵厌战，不愿作无谓之牺牲。大家整编时就纷纷要求退伍，这次才找到了一个回家的机会。至于国内政治（按指国民党统治地区）黑暗腐败早为我所不满，国民党从北伐以后早已失去革命精神，在二陈二谷一班‘党皇帝’把持下，官僚腐化，贪污成风，特务如毛，产业残败，民不聊生。最近更不惜出卖海关、航权，换得军事援助，让美国人到处横冲直撞，美货充斥市场，有如战前日寇侵犯中国之势。我对于国民党的前途早已消极悲观，认为国民党当局近十多年来已抛弃了总理的遗教，已不称其为政党，仅是少数人专横的集团。而在今天全世界潮流都趋向和平民主，决不容一党专政，更不容打内战消耗国力。国民党的内战政策，只是自杀自溃政策。从经济财粮人力动员上说，国民党统治地区已至财枯粮竭，兵疲民困之境，决不能长期支持内战。反观解放区，发动民众实行中山先生‘耕者有其田’的主张，军民团结一致加紧生产建设，这种力量是任何武器所消灭不了的。我主张立即成立各党各派的联合政府，共商国是。我相信如果有了由全国各党各派各界各军代表组织的联合政府，中国就不致再打内战。现在我希望全国军民一致团结起来，迅速制止少数人残杀大多数人民的惨剧！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th: A telegram from Xi'an reports: Ren Shishun, Lieutenant Colonel and CCP representative of the Thirty-Second Group negotiating the Central Plains ceasefire in Xi'an, was beaten by Chiang's side on the 6th of this month. Zhou Zijian, Director of the Xi'an Office of the 18th Group Army and representative of General Li Xiannian, was also robbed by Chiang's side. Since the Thirty-Second and Ninth Groups arrived in Xi'an, CCP representatives Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun and Colonel Xue Zizheng have been virtually imprisoned by special agents, with no freedom of movement. Chiang's side has also placed many restrictions on Mr. Zhou Zijian, General Li Xiannian's representative, preventing him from participating in mediation work. The 6th was the date stipulated by the three members of the Beiping Executive Headquarters for the Central Plains ceasefire agreement to take effect. On the afternoon of this day, when the group was discussing the issue of supplies for Li Xiannian's troops, the representatives of Chiang's side proposed the unreasonable solution that Li's troops must first be concentrated for verification before supplies would be resolved, but only funds would be issued, not food, and they would not be allowed to solve the problem locally. Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun stated that he could not accept this plan and requested that supplies be issued according to the general treatment of the National Army. Thereupon, Lu Jishi, the representative of Chiang's side, slammed the table and cursed, behaving in a tyrannical manner, and finally even raised a chair to attack. It only stopped after Xue Zizheng and Zhou Zijian persuaded him to stop. Then, adjutants and others from Hu Zongnan's department forced Mr. Zhou Zijian to leave immediately and warned that their safety would not be guaranteed after Mr. Zhou left. Mr. Zhou had no choice but to return to the 18th Group Army office. Unexpectedly, when passing the east entrance of Liangfu Street, they were suddenly surrounded by more than 20 armed special agents who had been lying in wait, with their pistols all pointed at Mr. Zhou's head, creating a menacing atmosphere. They robbed Mr. Zhou of his clothes, hats, shoes, socks, documents, ID cards, badges, armbands, valuables, etc., leaving only his undershirt and underpants. When the special agents were acting so recklessly in broad daylight in the downtown area, the police not only did not interfere, but instead ordered the onlookers to stay away. Currently, Mr. Zhou and the CCP representatives of the group can no longer contact the Yan'an radio station, nor can they contact Li Xiannian's troops through Yan'an, and they cannot contact each other. Their personal safety is no longer guaranteed, so the mediation work has come to a complete standstill. The CCP delegation here was extremely shocked and angry upon hearing the news and will lodge a serious protest with the Kuomintang.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋方破坏中原停战协议  西安谈判完全停顿  南京中共代表团将严重抗议\n\n1946-08-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋方破坏中原停战协议\n    西安谈判完全停顿\n    南京中共代表团将严重抗议\n    【新华社南京十五日电】西安航讯：在西安谈判中原停战的三十二小组中共代表任士舜中校，于本月六日遭蒋方殴打，李先念将军的代表、十八集团军西安办事处周子健处长，亦受蒋方拦路洗劫。按自第三十二小组、第九小组先后到达西安后、中共代表任士舜中校，薛子正上校即被特务实际上监禁，毫无行动自由。蒋方对李先念将军的代表周子健氏，也多方禁阻其参予调处工作。六日，为北平执行部三委员规定中原停战协议开始生效之日，这天午后，当小组讨论李先念部给养问题时，蒋方代表提出李部必先集中点验，始准解决给养，但仍只发款项，而不发粮食，也不许渠就地解决的无理办法。任士舜中校当表示不能接受这一方案，要求按一般国军待遇，发给给养。乃蒋方代表卢济时竟拍案大骂，态度横暴，最后竟高举桌椅行凶，经薛子正、周子健两氏劝阻，才得停止。接着，胡宗南部副官等人，又强迫周子健氏立即退出，并警告说，周氏离开后，将不保障他们安全。周氏无法，只好返回十八集团军办事处。不料行经梁府街东口时，突有预伏的武装特务二十余人包围，手枪一齐对准周氏头部，声势汹汹，随将周氏衣帽鞋袜和随身所带文件、身份证、胸章、臂章、贵重物品等一齐抢走，只剩下衬衣衬裤。当特务白昼于闹市如此横行时，警察不仅毫不干涉，反令围观的群众避开。现周氏及小组中共代表都不能再与延安电台联络，更不能经延安与李先念部联络，彼此亦不能互相联络，本身安全且失保障，故调处工作已完全停顿。此间中共代表团闻讯，极为震愤，将向国民党方面提出严重抗议。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 12th (Delayed Dispatch) The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Eighth Route Army launched a counter-offensive on the Longhai Railway on the night of the 10th and liberated Lanfeng, more than 40 kilometers east of Kaifeng on the Longhai Line, Lizhuang Station, more than 60 kilometers west of Xuzhou, and many towns and stations between Lanfeng and Lizhuang. A spokesperson for the military region stated: \"In view of the fact that Chiang's troops, after attacking most of our Yuduong region, have also occupied the entire Hubei-Henan border region and are still pursuing the Central Plains Military Region troops. On the Jiangsu-Anhui front, they have occupied areas such as Dingyuan, Tianchang, Sixian, Xiaoxian, and Rugao, and are now continuing to attack Dongtai and Gaoyou. At the same time, they are colluding with puppet troops to launch offensives from the central section of the Longhai Railway towards the Fengpei region to the north and the Xiayi, Yongcheng, Shangqiu, Ju county, and Zhe county regions to the south. In order to stop the fierce flames of Chiang's army's civil war, we had no choice but to launch a counter-offensive on the Longhai Railway on the night of the 10th, and have now liberated Lanfeng, Yejigang, Liba, Liuheji, Yangji, Dangshan, Lizhuang and other towns and stations. More than 100 kilometers of this section of the Longhai Railway is now under our control. According to preliminary statistics, in the Lanfeng campaign, we annihilated more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, forced more than 2,500 to lay down their weapons, and captured 11 tanks, several mortars, more than 200 small cannons, more than 50 heavy machine guns, more than 200 light machine guns, and more than 3,000 rifles.\"\n　　\n　　(Delayed Dispatch) Our newspaper, Heze, 14th The Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in the central section of the Longhai Railway, who are attacking the Yuduong, Huaibei, and Sulu border liberated areas, continue to suffer powerful counterattacks from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Eighth Route Army. According to supplementary war reports from the front lines: The Eighth Route Army launched a counter-offensive on the night of the 10th, and by the 13th, it had liberated many stations between Huangkou, more than 60 miles west of Xuzhou, and Luowang, 20 miles west of Lanfeng, including Huangkou, Lizhuang, Dangshan, Yangji, Liudi Quan, Liuheji, Liba, Yejigang, Lanfeng, and Luowang. As a result, nearly 300 miles of the central section of the Longhai Railway are now under the control of the Eighth Route Army. In this campaign, more than 8,000 men of the Kuomintang's Cao Fulin's 55th Army, 74th Division, and the puppet Zhang Lan's Provisional Fourth Column were annihilated or laid down their weapons. According to preliminary investigations, we captured a total of 11 tanks, more than 4,000 rifles, more than 350 light and heavy machine guns, more than 200 large and small cannons, three radio stations, 30 telephones, more than 100 war horses, eight trucks, four jeeps, and many other military supplies. Chiang's troops are still sending large reinforcements to the line, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.\n　　\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 15th The Chiang's troops in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, and between the Jinpu Longhai railways and the Grand Canal triangle area, continue to attack the Shandong liberated area, and have occupied the two county towns of Linzi and Guangrao. The main force of the Chiang Kai-shek's 8th Army, which was assembled at Zhangdian in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, invaded eastward along the railway on the 26th of last month, occupied the two stations of Xindian and Putong, and then turned to invade northward. The military and civilians in the Bohai area resolutely defended themselves, and the Linzi militia captured many Chiang's soldiers alive within two days. After suffering considerable damage, Chiang's troops occupied the two county towns of Linzi and Guangrao on the 8th and 10th of this month. Guangrao City was liberated by the Eighth Route Army from the hands of the enemy puppets on August 23rd of last year. Linzi City was recaptured twice from the hands of the enemy puppets on August 21st and October 1st of last year after bloody battles. It was once invaded by Chiang's troops on the 3rd of last month and was recovered by the Eighth Route Army on the 5th. On the southern Shandong front, the 37th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 77th Army, which invaded from Jiawang North to Duan East, occupied Jiantou (northeast of Jiawang), an important town on the south bank of the Grand Canal, on the 29th of last month, and continued to expand outwards on the 9th of this month, encountering a strong counterattack from the Eighth Route Army, leaving behind more than 70 corpses and fleeing back to their original location. As of the 7th, the main force of Chiang's 77th Army, which had invaded from Hanzhuang and Jiawang on the Jinpu Railway, had occupied a line of about 40 li on the north bank of the Grand Canal from Hanzhuang to Julianqiong (a ferry crossing on the Grand Canal, 32 li east of Hanzhuang), and is now confronting our army. Chiang Kai-shek's 97th Army, which is entrenched in the isolated stronghold of Lincheng on the Jinpu Line, is gathering its 33rd Division and waiting for orders to go south, in an attempt to cooperate with Chiang's troops, who are invading north from Hanzhuang, to open up the Lin (cheng) - Han (zhuang) section of the Jinpu Railway.\n　　\n　　Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 15th A certain unit of the Eighth Route Army in central Shanxi, on the 10th of this month, defeated more than 4,500 Yan's troops advancing in two directions and recovered important villages and towns such as Hongshan and Zhangliang. On the 10th, the 44th Division of Yan's army, in order to coordinate with the Chiang Kai-shek's army's offensive in southern Shanxi, launched an attack on our central Shanxi area in two directions at the same time. One route, with more than 2,500 men, advanced from Hongshan and Zhangliang in Jiexiu to the northeast 30-li area; the other route, with more than 2,000 men, advanced from Yuebi and Liji in Pingyao to the southwest area, attempting to encircle our garrison troops in the Mabi and Duncun areas. Our military learned of this in advance, maneuvered to the outer line, and combined with the local militia, fought bravely all day, and at dusk, defeated the Yan's troops advancing in two directions, and took the opportunity to recover all the villages and towns of Hongshan, Zhangliang, Aoziling, Yuebi, and Liji, which had fallen into the hands of Yan's troops on the 9th.\n　　\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 15th News from Chifeng Military: The Chiang's troops, who invaded along the Ye-Chi Line on the 30th of last month, were defeated and fled back to Dayi Station under the heroic counterattack of the military and civilians in the liberated area. In this battle, more than 60 of Chiang's soldiers were killed, including one commander, one captain, and one major company commander. More than 120 of Chiang's soldiers were wounded, and 40 officers and soldiers were captured. The defending army captured 50 war horses, more than 30 long and short guns, and one machine gun. Chiang's troops are currently repairing the railway in the Tianyi area and are sending out bandits who have been incorporated to harass the area, seemingly intending to commit another crime.\n　　\n　　(Attached picture)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陇海前线我军反攻大捷  解放兰封李坝砀山  消灭蒋伪军八千余缴坦克十一辆陇海路中段近三百里为我控制\n\n1946-08-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陇海前线我军反攻大捷\n    解放兰封李坝砀山\n    消灭蒋伪军八千余缴坦克十一辆陇海路中段近三百里为我控制\n    【新华社邯郸十二日电】（迟到）晋冀鲁豫八路军，已于十日夜开始向陇海路反攻，并解放陇海线上开封以东四十余公里的兰封、徐州以西六十余公里的李庄车站及兰封、李庄间的城镇车站多处。军区发言人称：我晋冀鲁豫军区部队，鉴于蒋军在攻击我所属豫东地区大部以后，又攻占鄂豫边区全部，并追击中原军区部队至今不停。在苏皖方面则攻占定远、天长、泗县、萧县、如皋等地区，现在续向东台、高邮方面进攻。同时，又联合伪军由陇海路中段向以北的丰沛地区，及以南的夏邑、永城、商邱、雎县、柘县等地区进攻。为制止蒋军内战的凶焰，不得不于十日夜向陇海路反攻，现已解放兰封、野鸡岗、李坝、柳河集、杨集、砀山、李庄等城镇车站，此段陇海路已有一百余公里被我控制。据初步统计，兰封战役中，我歼蒋伪军三千余，并使二千五百余放下武器，获坦克十一辆，迫击炮数门，小炮二百余门，重机枪五十余挺，轻机枪二百余挺，步枪三千余支。\n    【本报荷泽十四日电】（迟到）进攻豫东、淮北与苏鲁边解放区之陇海路中段蒋伪军，继续遭受晋冀鲁豫八路军之有力反击，据前线补充战报：八路军自十日夜开始反攻，至十三日已解放自徐州西六十余里之黄口、至兰封以西二十里之罗王之间车站多处，包括黄口、李庄、砀山、杨集、刘堤圈、柳河集、李坝、野鸡岗、兰封、罗王，至此，陇海路中段已有近三百里为八路军控制。此次战役中，国民党之曹福林五十五军七十四师、及伪张岚就暂第四纵队各一部共八千余人，被歼灭或放下武器。据初步清查：我共缴获坦克十一辆，步枪四千余支，轻重机枪三百五十余挺，大小炮二百余门，电台三部，电话机三十部，战马百余匹，汽车八辆，吉普车四辆，及其他军用品甚多。该线蒋军仍在大举增援，激战仍在进行中。\n    【新华社惠民十五日电】胶济路中段及津浦陇海两线与运河三角地带间之蒋军，继续进攻山东解放区，已侵占临淄、广饶两县城。集结于胶济路中段张店之蒋军第八军主力，于上月二十六日沿铁路东犯，侵占辛店及普通两车站后，复转而向北窜犯。勃海区军民坚决自卫，临淄民兵于二日内即生擒蒋军士兵多名。蒋军于受相当损伤后，于本月八日及十日侵占临淄与广饶两县城。广饶城系八路军于去年八月廿三日由敌伪手中解放，临淄城则为去年八月廿一日及十月一日经血战后，两次自敌伪手中夺回，上月三日曾遭蒋军一度窜陷，五日复为八路军收复。在鲁南方面，由贾汪北杜安东犯之蒋军七十七军三十七师，于上月二十九日侵占运河南岸重镇涧头（贾汪东北）后，本月九日复继续向外扩展，遭八路军有力阻击，遗尸七十余具逃回原地。截至七日，由津浦路韩庄及贾汪等地出犯之蒋军七十七军主力，于侵占自韩庄迄巨梁琼（韩庄东三十二里运河渡口）运河北岸约四十华里之线后，现与我军对峙中。盘踞于津浦线孤立据点临城之蒋九十七军，除其主力于七日向东北窜犯外，其三十三师正集结待命南下，企图配合由韩庄北犯之蒋军，打通津浦路之临（城）韩（庄）段。\n    【本报阳城十五日电】晋中八路军某部，本月十日击溃两路进犯阎军四千五百余人，再度收复洪山、张良等重要村镇。十日阎军四十四师为策应晋南蒋军进攻，分两路同时向我晋中区进犯，一路二千五百余人，由介休洪山、张良向东北三十里地区进犯；一路二千余人，由平遥岳壁、黎基向西南地区进犯，企图夹击我马壁、段村一带守军，我军事先得息，机动转移外线，结合当地民兵，奋战终日，于黄昏时将两路进犯阎军击溃，并乘胜恢复九日失陷于阎军手中之洪山、张良、鳌子岭、岳壁、黎基等全部村镇。\n    【新华社承德十五日电】赤峰军息：上月三十日沿叶赤线进犯之蒋军，在解放区军民英勇反击下，受创逃回大义车站。是役蒋军死亡六十余人，内有司令官一名，队长一名，少校中队长一名，负伤蒋军一百二十余人，被俘官兵四十余，守军缴获战马五十匹，长短枪三十余支，机枪一挺。蒋军刻在天义一带修铁路，并派收编之土匪四出窜扰，似有再犯模样。\n    （附图片）"

    "content": "Today's Jiyuan\n\nAfter the perfidious Chiang Kai-shek troops violated the agreement and attacked Jiyuan on January 14th of this year, occupying our Potou Town (which has now been recovered), the people of Jiyuan have been on the front lines of the self-defense struggle. They have been fighting to defend themselves with one hand while actively engaging in various production and construction activities with the other. In the short period of less than a year, significant achievements have been made in various areas of work.\n\nThe flames of grievance and revenge are raging everywhere, and the struggle for rent reduction and liquidation is being carried out universally. In villages such as Maoling, Lianzhuang, and Mazhu, which are three to five miles away from Potou, the stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek troops, the struggle is being carried out vigorously, and the liberated masses have triumphed. An old lady in her sixties from Shilingtou Village tearfully expressed her heartfelt words at a mass meeting in the fifth district: \"I have lived a hard life for my whole life, and no one has ever saved me. Now that the Eighth Route Army has come, Chairman Mao has finally saved me.\"\n\nThe people understand that in order to defend the happy life they have gained through democracy, they must bravely participate in the self-defense struggle. When Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacked Dubalian on May 14th of this year, militiamen sacrificed two lives heroically in the battle to cover the transfer of the masses. The rest rushed to the front line without hesitation and repelled the enemy's attack. The county's militia has grown to more than 4,700 people in the self-defense struggle. They seized 1,400 guns from the hands of traitors, bandits, and despots, and they have armed themselves with these weapons.\n\n            ×                    ×                    ×\n\nWith the victory of the struggle, poor peasants have all obtained land, which has further increased their enthusiasm for production. Wushan used to have more than 20 extremely poor households, but now each person has an average of at least 1.1 mu of cultivated land. During the spring plowing season this year, the government issued agricultural loans of 5.5 million yuan and textile loans of 80 million yuan, which solved the production difficulties of the peasants and inspired their enthusiasm for production. As a result, peasants are vying to purchase draft cattle and restore cultivation. This year alone, more than 200 draft cattle have been purchased in the fifth district; Wushan has increased its draft cattle by more than 20 heads since the wheat harvest. The five famous canals, Guangji, Hongli, Guanghui, Yongli, and Ganling, which were destroyed by the enemy in the past, have now been repaired, which can increase the area of paddy fields by 2,000 mu. …\n\nThe peasants of Jiyuan all understand a simple truth: \"In the past, we worked for others, but now we work for ourselves.\" Therefore, their actions are more active. This summer, more than 80% of the peasants have organized themselves for production, and women are also involved in the production upsurge. Women in Nan's Village participated in mutual aid teams, with six women pulling a plow to plow four mu of land a day; a woman in Dongguoluo Village cultivated more than 20 mu of land. ... In short, thanks to the victory of the struggle, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has generally increased.\n\n            ×                    ×                      ×\n\nAfter the Eighth Route Army liberated Jiyuan, it brought real democracy to the people of Jiyuan. They began to speak out and began to elect village chiefs who could really do things for everyone. Wushan was very cautious in the election. After seven days of democratic discussion, they elected Li Qingshan, a peasant leader who had been liberated and was loved by everyone, as the village chief. For thousands of years, they never dreamed that they would have today's life, where they are their own masters and elect their own village chiefs.\n\nNow, 132 of the 169 administrative villages in the district have elected their own village chiefs through democratic elections.\n\nThanks to the government's active support, industry and commerce have developed greatly. There are many shops in the city, and every market town around the city and in the countryside (there are a total of 15 market towns) has no less than two or three thousand people on market days, which shows the increase in people's purchasing power. In addition, there is the development of handicrafts: there are already more than 40 flour mills and oil mills in the county; the government has invested 20 million yuan to support the resumption of the ×× coal mine, which has been shut down for a long time. All the original employees have returned to work, and the number of workers has increased greatly. The industrialist Zhai Le'an has invested 1 million yuan. Thanks to the coordination and cooperation between the trade union and the factory, the living conditions of the workers have been improved, and the production efficiency has increased by 30%. Therefore, shareholder Mr. Zhai Le'an also believes that the investment is profitable. In short, under the conditions of labor-capital coordination, Jiyuan's industry and commerce are developing day by day.\n\nJiyuan has been reborn. It is no longer the barren, terrible, cannibalistic world under the rule of the enemy and puppets in the past. Under the leadership of the democratic government, it has embarked on the road of peace and prosperity.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 今日的济源\n\n1946-08-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　今日的济源\n    蒋军背信弃义，于今年一月十四日违约进攻济源，侵占我坡头镇后（现已收复），济源人民即处于自卫斗争的前哨阵地，他们一手持枪自卫，一手又积极从事各种生产建设，在短短不到一年的时间内，各种工作都有显著成绩。\n    诉苦复仇的火焰到处炽燃，减租清算的斗争普遍进行。在相距蒋军据点——坡头三五里地的茅岭、连庄、马柱等村，斗争轰轰烈烈的开展着，翻身的群众胜利了。石灵头村的一位六十多岁的老太太，在五区翻身大会上，感动的流着泪说出心底里的话：“我过了一辈子苦日子，谁也没有救我，现在八路军来了，毛主席才算救了我”。\n    人民懂得要保卫已获得民主的幸福的生活，只有勇敢的参加自卫斗争。今年五月十四日蒋军进攻杜八联时，民兵为掩护群众转移，在作战中，曾有两名英勇牺牲，其余的则毫不犹豫的冲上火线，击退敌人的进攻。全县民兵在自卫斗争中，已发展到四千七百余人。从汉奸、土匪、恶霸的手中，他们夺回了一千四百支枪，他们又以这些武器，武装了自己。\n            ×                    ×                    ×\n    随着斗争的胜利，贫苦农民都得到了土地，因而生产情绪更加提高。武山过去有二十多户赤贫，现在平均每人最少有耕地一亩一分。在今年春耕时期，政府发放农业贷款五百五十万元，纺织贷款八千万元，解决了农民生产困难，启发了农民的生产积极性，因而农民争购耕牛，恢复耕作。今年仅五区购入耕牛在二百头以上；武山从麦收到现在增加耕牛二十多头。过去被敌破坏了的广吉、红利、广惠、永利，甘陵等五大名渠，现已修复。可增加水田两千亩。……\n    济源农民都明白了一个浅显的道理：“从前是给别人干，现在是给自己干”。所以他们的行动是更加积极了。今夏有百分之八十以上的农民组织起来进行生产，妇女亦卷入生产热潮。南石村的妇女参加互助组，六个妇女用人拉犁，一天犁地四亩；东郭洛村有一妇女种地二十多亩。……总之，由于斗争的胜利，农民的生产热情普遍提高。\n            ×                    ×                      ×\n    八路军解放了济源以后，给济源人民带来了真正的民主。他们开始张嘴说话，开始选举真正能为大家办事的村长。武山在选举中是非常慎重的，经过了七天的民主讨论，他们选出了为大家所爱戴的农民翻身领袖李青山为村长。几千年他们做梦都没有想到会有今天的日子，他们自己做主人，自己选村长。\n    现在，全区一百六十九个行政村，已有一百三十二个行政村经过民主选举的方式，选举了自己的村长。\n    由于政府的积极扶持，工商业有了很大发展。城内商店林立，城周围的乡村集镇，每逢集日，每一个集镇（共有十五个集镇），都不下两三千人，这说明了人民购买力的提高。除此则是手工业的发展：全县已有四十多座粉房和油房；政府以两千万元扶植久已停工的××煤矿复业，原有的职员已全体复工，工人已大大增加，工业家翟乐安投资一百万元。由于工会与厂方的协调与合作，工人生活得到改善，生产效率提高了百分之三十。因而股东翟乐安先生也认为投资是有利可图的。总之，在劳资协调的情况下，济源的工商业日益发展。\n    济源已经新生了，它已经不是过去敌伪统治时那种荒芜可怕的人吃人的世界，在民主政府的领导下，它已走上和平繁荣的道路。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-19",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Liberation Daily Editorial\n\n　　Encouraged by the erroneous policies of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek completely tore up the truce agreement, the Four Pledges, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the troop reorganization plan, and the Northeast truce agreement. After fighting fiercely in the Northeast, he extended the war to within the borders, repeatedly demanding the occupation of northern Jiangsu, the Jiaoji Railway, Jehol, and most of the Northeast. His troops have already occupied all of the Central Plains Liberated Area, most of the eastern Henan Liberated Area, a portion of the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Area, many towns along the Jiaoji Railway, and many places in southern Shanxi, central Hebei, eastern Hebei, Jehol, and the Northeast, and are launching large-scale offensives against various Liberated Areas. The troops that Chiang Kai-shek has deployed to attack the Liberated Areas account for 85 percent of his total military strength. From Xinjiang in the west to the East China Sea in the east, from Guangdong in the south to the Yangtze River in the north, Chiang Kai-shek has only left 15 percent of his troops in this vast region. Chiang Kai-shek's air force is entirely devoted to the civil war and has even bombed Yan'an. Judging from the deployment of troops, Chiang Kai-shek is using every last drop of his strength in a desperate gamble. No one can deny that the Chinese people have once again been plunged into a full-scale civil war by Chiang Kai-shek, on a scale unprecedented in decades. Precisely because this civil war is so large-scale and because Chiang Kai-shek continues to receive assistance from the reactionary faction in the United States, the Chinese people must not underestimate Chiang Kai-shek's offensive this time. We must unite, work hard, and crush this offensive!\n\n　　When the truce order was issued on January 10th and the Political Consultative Conference closed on January 31st this year, we Communists believed that China had begun to enter a new stage of peace and democracy. Current events show that we members of the Chinese Communist Party were too eager for peace and democracy, overestimated the reliability of the U.S. government in adhering to the Moscow Three-Power Conference resolutions, and thus overestimated Chiang Kai-shek's promises. In order to salvage peace, even after Chiang Kai-shek had already begun to tear up his various promises, the CCP still made multiple concessions and put forward multiple peace proposals, but all were rejected by Chiang Kai-shek. Now the historical facts are very clear: the charter of peace and democracy has been fundamentally overturned by Chiang Kai-shek, the flames of all-out war have been ignited by Chiang Kai-shek, and the one who is helping Chiang Kai-shek equip, transport, and even cooperate in the fighting of his civil war troops is none other than the U.S. government, which loudly proclaims \"mediation\" and \"aid to China.\" Therefore, all the hopes of the people of the country must be placed on the victory of the just self-defense war of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas. The people of the whole country have learned from countless painful experiences that only if the people's self-defense war in the Liberated Areas is victorious can there be hope for peace and democracy in the whole country, can everyone have food to eat, can secret agents and corruption disappear, and can national independence be guaranteed. This truth remains true today, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, in order to protect the lives, property, rights, and happiness of the people in all Liberated Areas, in order to resolve the great disaster and crisis of the people of the country, and in order to restore peace and implement the solemn resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the military and civilians in all Liberated Areas today face their historical task: to mobilize all forces to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!\n\n　　Why does Chiang Kai-shek dare to attack the Liberated Areas? This is because the reactionary faction in the United States has given him various kinds of military aid, which has made him dizzy and made him think that he has the \"upper hand\" militarily. Chiang Kai-shek and a small group of warmongering warlords and party hacks have uttered countless wild words, saying that they can eliminate the people's army in the Liberated Areas within a year, half a year, or even three months. But Chiang Kai-shek is wrong! He only knows that war is determined by weapons, but he does not know that war is even more importantly determined by the soldiers who wield the weapons and the people who support the soldiers. The soldiers and the people are the foundation of victory. Chiang Kai-shek only has one advantage militarily, which is the weapons supplied to him by the United States. In addition, all are weaknesses: First, Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers are weary of war, because this war is fought too unreasonably. Even if Chiang Kai-shek repeats the old tune he sang at Lushan on \"August 13th\" a thousand times, he cannot convince a Chinese soldier to give his life for him. This weakness alone is more than enough to offset his advantage. All his sophisticated weapons can be \"laid down\" by his soldiers. In the one month of war in the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, Chiang Kai-shek's side lost 10,000 people their weapons and lives, and 30,000 people preserved their lives, but laid down their weapons, including several divisions famous for their combat in the War of Resistance. Second, the people on Chiang Kai-shek's side are even more opposed to the war, to the extent that Chiang Kai-shek has to fight against his own unarmed people while waging war against the Liberated Areas. For example, the Xiaguan massacre and the Kunming assassination case are examples of this. The people who oppose the war include not only workers, peasants, students, and staff, but also landlords, capitalists, and senior officials. The number of people who really want to fight a civil war is very small. Third, even the people who demand war themselves have no confidence. A very important financier and administrator in the National Government once frankly admitted that the Kuomintang's \"neither reconciliation nor war\" will drag it down, and war will defeat it, although he still chooses the latter path. From Soong Tzu-wen and Hsu Kan to Marshall and Stuart, all admit that the Kuomintang's financial and economic situation is facing total collapse, and this is still the case with the relatively small scale of war in the past six months. If the war continues to be fought on a large scale, the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will be even more plundered to the point of having no place to bury themselves, the rural areas in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will be even more bankrupt, the industry will be even more destroyed, and the Kuomintang's financial and economic situation will be even more of a dead end. No matter how Chiang Kai-shek suppresses it, the war-weary and anti-war hearts and minds of the soldiers and people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will turn into a great fire that will burn Chiang Kai-shek's own fascist group! Therefore, various Chinese and foreign newspapers, including some newspapers that have always supported Chiang Kai-shek, have warned that continuing to fight will only give the Communist Party more advantages militarily and politically. Their observations are reasonable, because the situation in the Liberated Areas is exactly the opposite of that of Chiang Kai-shek: First, the Liberated Areas oppose war, but Chiang Kai-shek launched the war and forced the Liberated Areas to rise up in self-defense. The war is for the interests of the people, for the interests of the nation, it is just, indignant, sacred, and related to the life, death, safety, and well-being of the people of all Liberated Areas and the people of the country. Therefore, the warriors who give the reactionary faction a crushing blow in the self-defense war are supported and worshiped by the people of all Liberated Areas and the people of the country, just as they were in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Second, the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas are a close, free, and equal family. This family does not have the wealthy nobles, warlords, and secret agents that are unique to Chiang Kai-shek's side, so there will be no \"collapse.\" Third, this family is not only firmly rooted, but it is also really big. It already includes one-third of the country's population, equal to the entire population of the United States. It has such a large area, such a large army and militia. If Chiang Kai-shek has not been able to fight out a result with it in the past ten years of civil war, it is even more impossible for him to fight out a result today. Chiang Kai-shek and his fascist oligarchic group, who are enemies of the people of the whole country, will not live long if they continue to be reactionary. The current Liberated Areas have rich experience to cope with any serious offensive. The army of the Liberated Areas sometimes temporarily withdraws from some land and some cities in order to easily eliminate the invading enemy's vital forces. This is inevitable and necessary, but it rarely loses its own vital forces. In fact, since the Southern Anhui Incident, the reactionary faction has not annihilated a single battalion or regiment of the Eighth Route Army or the New Fourth Army. On the contrary, Chiang Kai-shek's army, which is attacking the Liberated Areas, was, is, and will always be a constant source of replenishment of personnel and weapons for the army of the Liberated Areas. Since Chiang Kai-shek is determined not to have peace, let him choose war. Sooner or later, he will have to be convinced that history develops according to the demands of the people, not according to the demands of reactionary factions in China and abroad, and is not determined by foreign weapons.\n\n　　Chiang Kai-shek's war plan must be crushed, and it will inevitably be crushed, but this does not mean that the victory of the people's self-defense war will come easily, and it does not mean that we should be arrogant and careless because of the victories we have already achieved. Because of the assistance of the United States, the reactionary faction still has certain, even temporary and one-sided, superior weapon conditions militarily. We must be vigilant and cautious. The safety of all Liberated Areas, the happiness and misfortune of the people of the country, and the future of the country and the nation are all on our shoulders. Any arrogance or carelessness is a serious crime. All the forces in all Liberated Areas must be fully mobilized to serve the self-defense war. All soldiers and people must fully understand the nature, situation, and future of the war; the regular army must correctly understand the guiding principles of the war, carefully organize each battle, ensure the victory of each battle, must earnestly examine and strengthen the political work of the troops, continue to improve the awareness and discipline of the cadres and soldiers of the troops, personal model of military-civilian relations, and timely eliminate any bad tendencies in the troops; guerrillas and militia should closely cooperate with the main force in combat, and learn from the example of the First Division of Jiangsu-Anhui, persist in guerrilla warfare in the areas where the main force has withdrawn, contain the reactionary faction's offensive, attack the reactionary faction's rear, and protect the interests of the people there, so that they will not be destroyed by the reactionary faction. The supply of the troops, the care of the wounded, and all other rear work and battlefield service work should be carried out jointly by the army, the government, and the people's organizations, so that the fighting troops can fight with peace of mind. The self-defense war is supported by the people. The people are willing to contribute their manpower and material resources to achieve victory, but the army and the government must still pay great attention to cherishing the people's strength, pay great attention to thrift, strictly prohibit extravagance and waste, so as to reduce the burden on the people as much as possible. In short, only by mobilizing all the military and civilians in all Liberated Areas and carrying out tense and arduous struggle can we crush the reactionary faction's offensive! Our struggle is just, our victory is what the people of the whole country rely on, we are supported by justice and will receive abundant assistance, Chiang Kai-shek is unpopular and will receive little assistance, our future is bright, and we will definitely win!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全解放区人民动员起来粉碎蒋介石的进攻  解放日报社论\n\n1946-08-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　全解放区人民动员起来粉碎蒋介石的进攻\n    解放日报社论\n    由于蒋介石在美国错误政策鼓励之下，完全撕毁了停战协定、四项诺言、政协决议、整军方案、和东北停战协议，在东北大打之后，又把战火烧进关内，再三要求占领苏北、胶济线、热河、和东北绝大部分，他的军队已经侵占了中原解放区全部，豫东解放区大部，苏皖解放区的一部，胶济线许多城镇，晋南冀中冀东热河和东北的许多地方，并正在向各解放区大举进攻。蒋介石调来进攻各解放区的军队，已达其全部兵力百分之八十五。西至新疆，东至东海，南至广东，北至长江，这一个广大地区中，蒋介石只留下百分之十五的兵力。蒋介石的空军都用来进行内战，并轰炸了延安。从兵力的部署上看，蒋介石是用尽了最后一滴力量来孤注一掷。谁也不能否认，中国人民已被蒋介石再一次抛入全面内战，规模之大是数十年来所未有的。正因为此次内战规模巨大，而且蒋介石又有美国反动派继续援助，因此中国人民决不能轻视此次蒋介石的进攻，必须团结起来，努力奋斗，将这次进攻予以粉碎！\n    在今年一月十日停战令发布，一月三十一日政协会闭幕的时候，我们共产党人曾经认为中国已经开始进入和平民主的新阶段。现在的事变，表明我们中共党人是太热望和平与民主，过高的估计了美国政府遵守莫斯科三国会议决议的可靠性，以至过高的相信了蒋介石的诺言。为了挽救和平，就在蒋介石已经开始撕毁他的各项诺言以后，中共仍然作了多次的忍让，提出了多次的和平建议，但是都受到了蒋介石的拒绝。现在历史的事实，已经非常清楚：和平与民主的宪章已经被蒋介石从根本上推翻了，全面战争的火焰已经被蒋介石点起了，而帮助蒋介石装备运输其内战军队甚至配合其作战的不是别人，恰恰就是高唱“调处”和“援华”的美国政府。因此全国人民的一切希望，就不得不寄托于解放区军民正义的自卫战争的胜利。全国人民已经从无数的惨痛经验中知道，只有解放区人民自卫战争胜利了，全国才有和平民主的希望，才能使人人有饭吃，特务和贪污才会敛迹，民族的独立才有保障。这一真理，在抗日战争胜利后的今天，依然是真理。因此，为了保卫全解放区人民的生命财产权利幸福，为了解救全国人民的大灾难大危机，为了恢复和平实行政协的庄严决议，全解放区军民今天面对着自己的历史任务：动员一切力量粉碎蒋介石的进攻！\n    蒋介石为什么敢于进攻解放区？这是因为美国反动派给了他各种军事援助，使他冲昏头脑，以为他在军事上“占上风”了，蒋介石及其一小群内战狂的军阀党棍，曾经发出无数狂言，说在一年内、半年内、甚至三个月内，就可以消灭解放区的人民军队。但是蒋介石错了！他只知道战争决定于武器，而不知道战争更重要的是决定于拿武器的士兵和供养士兵的人民，兵民才是胜利之本。蒋介石在军事上仅仅有一个优点，就是美国供给他的武器。此外都是弱点：第一、蒋介石的兵心厌战，因为这个仗打得太没有道理，那怕蒋介石把“八一三”在庐山所讲的老调再讲一千遍，也不能说服一个中国士兵去为他舍命，仅仅这个弱点，就已经抵消了他的优点而有余。他的一切高妙的武器，都可以被他的士兵“放下”的。在苏皖边区一个月的战争中，蒋介石方面就有一万人丧失了武器和生命，有三万人保存了生命，但是放下了武器，其中包括在抗战中以作战著名的几个师。第二、蒋介石那边的民心尤其反战，以至蒋介石在向解放区作战的同时，不得不向自己所统治的徒手人民作战，例如下关惨案和昆明的暗杀案，就是如此。反战的人民不仅包括工人农民学生职员，而且包括地主资本家和高级官员。真正想打内战的人，数目很少。第三、甚至要求战争的人自己也没有信心，国民政府的一个很重要的财主兼行政官，曾经坦白承认国民党“不和不战”是拖垮，战是打垮，虽然他还是选择最后一条路。从宋子文、徐堪、到马歇尔、司徒雷登，都承认国民党的财政经济状况是面临着总崩溃，而这还是过去半年战争规模比较小的情形，战争继续大规模的打下去，国民党统治区的人民将更加被掠夺得死无葬身之地，国民党统治区的农村将更加破产，工业将更加毁灭，国民党的财政经济将更加是死路一条，不管蒋介石怎样镇压，那时国民党统治区厌战反战的兵心与民心，就会变成烧死蒋介石自己法西斯集团的一团大火！所以中外各报，包括素来拥护蒋介石的若干报纸，都警告说打下去只有使共产党在军事上政治上更得势。他们的观察是有理由的，因为解放区的情形恰恰和蒋介石相反：第一，解放区反对战争，但是蒋介石发起了战争，强迫解放区起而自卫战争是为了恢复和平和实现政协决议，这个自卫战争是为人民的利益，是为民族的利益，是正义的、悲愤的、神圣的，是与全解放区人民和全国人民的生死安危相关联的。因此，在自卫战争中给反动派以粉碎打击的勇士们，受到全解放区和全国人民的拥护顶礼膜拜，如同在抗日战争中一样。第二，解放区的军民是一个亲密的自由平等的大家庭，这个家庭没有蒋介石那边所特有的吸尽民脂民膏的豪富贵族军阀特务，因此也不会有“崩溃”。第三，这个家庭不但根基巩固，而且也着实是大了，它已经包括全国人口的三分之一，等于美国全国的人口，它有这样大的面积，这样大的军队和民兵，如果蒋介石过去经过十年内战也没有和它打出个结果，今天他想打出结果是更加不可能了。与全国人民为敌的蒋介石和他的法西斯寡头集团继续反动下去，是一定没有多久生命的。现在的解放区已经有了丰富的经验足以应付任何严重的进攻，解放区的军队为了便于消灭入侵敌人的有生力量，有时暂时的退出一些土地一些城市，这是不可免的，而且是必要的，但是却很少损失自己的有生力量。事实上从皖南事变以来，反动派就没有消灭过八路军、新四军一营一团，相反的，进攻解放区的蒋介石军队，过去是现在是将来也还是解放区军队的人员武器的经常补充来源。既然蒋介石坚决不愿意和平，那么就让他选择战争吧，迟早总要叫他信服：历史是按着人民的要求发展，而不是按着中外反动派的要求发展的，也不是决定于外国的武器。\n    蒋介石战争计划必须被粉碎，也必然被粉碎，但是这决不是说人民自卫战争的胜利会容易的到来，这决不是说我们应当以已有的胜利而骄傲轻率。反动派因为美国的援助，在军事上既然还占有某种即使是暂时的和片面的比较优越的武器条件，我们就必须警惕戒慎，全解放区的安危、全国人民的祸福、国家民族前途的吉凶都担在我们的肩上，任何骄傲轻率都是严重的罪恶。全解放区的一切力量必须充分动员起来，服务于自卫战争，所有的战士和人民都必须充分了解战争的性质形势和前途；正规军必须正确了解战争的指导方针，细心的组织每一个战役，保证每一个战役的胜利，必须切实检查和加强部队的政治工作，继续提高部队干部和战士的觉悟性和纪律性，个人模范的军民关系，及时消灭部队中的任何不良倾向；游击队和民兵要密切配合主力作战，并学习苏皖一分区的榜样，在主力撤退的地区坚持游击战争，箝制反动派的进攻，打击反动派的后方，保护那里的人民利益，使不受反动派所摧残。部队的补给，伤兵的料理，以及其他一切后方工作和战地服务工作，应当由军队政府和人民团体共同努力，使战斗的部队得以安心作战。自卫战争是人民所拥护的，人民意愿贡献自己的人力物力来取得胜利，但是军队和政府仍然必须十分注意爱惜民力，十分注意节约，严禁铺张浪费，借以尽一切可能来减轻人民的负担。总之，只有全解放区军民一致动员，进行紧张的艰苦的奋斗，才能粉碎反动派的进攻！我们的奋斗是正义的，我们的胜利是全国人民所寄托的，我们是得道多助，蒋介石是失道寡助，我们的前途是光明的，我们一定要胜利！"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th (delayed dispatch). Chiang's troops, taking advantage of the conflict created in Anping, have spread and escalated the war to the Xianghe and Sanhe areas. Due to the delaying tactics adopted by both Chiang and the U.S. sides, the group from the Twenty-Fifth Special Team has been unable to go to the Xianghe front line to implement mediation and cessation of hostilities. This group was formed by order of the Three-Man Committee, specifically to mediate conflicts in the Xianghe area and is attached to the Twenty-Fifth Special Team. On the morning of the 11th, at a group meeting, the U.S. representative proposed four times that the CCP representative agree that this group was independent, attempting to isolate the Anping incident from the Xianghe war and obstruct a fair and reasonable resolution of the incident. The CCP representative immediately pointed out that this was inconsistent with the order of the Three-Man Committee and should be reserved. At this time, Chiang's representative, Wu ×ding, took the opportunity to make trouble and said, \"Your reservation of opinion means that the group cannot work, and I want to protest.\" He echoed the U.S. representative. After the CCP representative's explanation, it was decided to discuss the group's departure based on the original order. The U.S. side then proposed that the group should go to the Anping area. The CCP representative believed that the group should first implement a ceasefire, but Anping town had already been captured by the Nationalists in violation of orders, and the war had exceeded Anping and expanded to the vicinity of Xianghe. Therefore, the group should go directly to Xianghe. The U.S. representative then agreed to this proposal, but wanted to go via Hewu, through Anping, and then to Xianghe. Chiang's representative also initially agreed. However, a few minutes later, Chiang's representative withdrew his opinion and insisted that the group only go to Hewu and Anping town. Therefore, the afternoon meeting ended without result. In the afternoon, the U.S. representative changed his opinion again, and the record cancelled the section agreeing to go to Xianghe. After the CCP representative's stern criticism, it was added again. At that time, the CCP representative took the initiative to concede, stating that they could go to Xianghe via Anping and Hewu, but the U.S. representative at this time completely overturned his opinion and refused to go to Xianghe. Due to the capricious nature of the Chiang and U.S. representatives, the group meeting ended without any results.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th (delayed dispatch). The Twenty-Fifth Special Team investigating the Anping incident continued to hold meetings on the 11th. The Chiang and U.S. representatives still attempted to have the team listen to a one-sided report from the U.S. Marines before the Three-Man Committee's instructions on investigation procedures arrived. Chiang's representative even attempted to undermine the principle of tripartite agreement in mediation through unilateral actions, causing the group to split and the mediation work to fall into a hopeless and dire situation. At the beginning of the meeting on the 11th, U.S. representative Colonel Davis declared that the Three-Man Committee would transmit an instruction stipulating the investigation procedure, and that before the instruction was received, the report of the U.S. Marines should be heard first. CCP representative Major General Huang Yifeng immediately pointed out that the report of the U.S. Marines representative was within the investigation procedure, and therefore it was not appropriate to act arbitrarily before the Three-Man Committee's official instructions arrived. Chiang's representative, Zhang Shuheng, even said: \"Our two sides have the same opinion, and the other side cannot prevent us from acting.\" He proposed that the Chiang and U.S. sides should listen to the report of the U.S. Marines separately. The CCP representative immediately refuted him sternly, and the meeting was temporarily adjourned to await the Three-Man Committee's instructions on procedural matters.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀东战火蔓延扩大蒋美代表拖延调处\n\n1946-08-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀东战火蔓延扩大蒋美代表拖延调处\n    【新华社北平十二日电】（迟到）蒋军利用安平就地造成之战火，已蔓延扩大至香河、三河地区，由于蒋美双方采取拖延战术拖延时间，二十五特别小组的分组至今迟迟未能赴香河前线，实行调处制止。该分组系奉三委员之命组成，专为调处香河地区冲突之组织，附属于第二十五特别小组。十一日上午，分组会议上美代表四次提出，要中共代表同意这个分组是独立的，企图经此使安平事件与香河战争隔离起来，以阻碍事件公平合理的解决。中共代表当即认为这与三委员命令不符，应予保留。蒋方代表吴×定此时竟乘机取闹说：“你保留意见就是使小组不能工作，我要抗议。”与美代表一唱一和。经中共代表解释，决定仍根据原来命令，讨论分组出发事宜。美方又提分组应到安平地区，中共代表认为分组应首先实行停战，而安平镇已为国方违令攻占，战事已超过安平，扩大至香河附近，因此分组应直接去香河。美代表乃同意此议，但要走河西务，经安平再到香河，蒋方代表也一度表示同意。但数分钟后，该蒋方之代表又撤消了自己的意见，主张分组只到河西务、安平镇，故下午会议无结果。下午美代表又更改了自己的意见，记录取消了同意赴香河一段，经中共代表严正指责，乃重补上。但当时中共代表自动让步，表示可以经过安平、河西务到香河，但美方代表于此时却根本推翻了自己的意见，拒绝去香河。由于蒋美代表反复无常，使分组会议竟日无结果而散。\n    【新华社北平十二日电】（迟到）调查安平事件之第二十五特别小组十一日继续举行会议，蒋美双方代表仍企图在三委员关于调查程序指示未到达前，先让小组听取美方陆战队的片面报告，蒋方代表更妄图以单独行动破坏三方一致协议的调处原则，使小组分裂，调处工作陷于无法收拾的恶劣境地。十一日会议开始时，美代表戴维思上校即宣称三委员将传达一指示规定调查程序，在指示未接到前，应先听取美陆战队之报告。中共代表黄逸峰少将当即指出美陆战队代表之报告，系在调查程序之内，故在三委员正式指示未到达前，未便随意行动。而蒋方代表张叔衡竟谓：“我们两方意见一致，另一方面不能阻止我们行动。”提议蒋美两方单独听取美陆战队之报告云云。中共代表当即严予驳斥，会议乃暂时休会，等候三委员关于程序问题之指示。"

    "content": "Kuomintang Plots to Strangle the Cultural Sphere\n　　Poet Wang Yaping Flees to the Border Region\n　　Recounts the Political Darkness and People's Suffering in the Great Rear Area\n　　[Our newspaper, Heze, 14th dispatch] Progressive poet Mr. Wang Yaping, deeply angered by the Kuomintang's special agent oppression, arrived in Heze on the 9th of August after traveling from Chongqing. When this reporter visited him, I saw Mr. Wang's joy shining through his thin and haggard appearance, his eyes gleaming. He said: \"The Kuomintang-controlled area has become a world of demons. Especially for cultural figures being tracked and persecuted, since the murders of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, the atmosphere is tense everywhere. Many cultural friends have nowhere to hide. The Kuomintang special agents registered the names of cultural figures, dividing them into four categories: The first category consists of those with higher status, greater prestige, and slightly older age, such as Guo Moruo and Zhang Shenfu; the second category consists of those who are younger, ideologically progressive, and have strong activity capabilities; the late Tao Xingzhi was the top name in this category, and the murdered Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo also belonged to this category; the third category consists of those with wavering thoughts and unclear understanding; the fourth category consists of those with muddled thoughts. The special agents believe that the first category is old and will not be active for long, so they are temporarily spared. The second category must be completely eliminated, leaving none alive. Li and Wen were the first two to be sacrificed. The third category is bought off with money and official positions. The fourth category is allowed to live. Chongqing has now practically implemented fascist police control, with three investigations a day. The special agents' blacklists are divided into red cards, black cards, and white cards. Those registered on the red cards are killed without exception, those on the black cards are subject to further investigation, and those on the white cards are temporarily spared. In early July, Chongqing Mayor Zhang Dulun hosted a meeting with special agent leaders, calling it a 'Rectification of Chongqing Morale' meeting. Wang Zanxu, Commander of the Chongqing Garrison, believed that only 'killing' could achieve rectification. Thus, after the murders of Li and Wen, a large number of progressive young students in Chongqing were killed and arrested. Now, more than forty magazines and newspapers in Kunming, such as the Democratic Weekly, have been shut down, and many magazines and newspapers in Shanghai have also been suspended because the authorities secretly ordered the printing houses not to publish them.\"\n　　After a pause, Mr. Wang spoke angrily about his own situation. He said: \"Even when I edited some poetry journals and wrote a few poems in Chongqing newspapers, special agents tracked me day and night. When I was about to leave Chongqing, Mr. Guo Moruo went to Shanghai, and I lived in Mr. Guo's house. On the 'July 7th' anniversary, the special agents planned a major disruption. On the 6th, a policeman in yellow uniform came to my house to 'visit.' He clearly knew I lived there, but he insisted on asking who lived there, what they did, and forced me to fill out a form, even asking which school I taught at. The next day was 'July 7th,' so I avoided it. On the evening of the 8th, the same policeman in yellow uniform came again, bringing two plainclothes men with short guns. They looked around and searched my house, asking this and that. One special agent said: 'Mr. Wang, your house is very nice. How about letting me live here?' I said: 'Where would I live?' The special agent said fiercely: 'Is it any of my business?' I knew the situation was serious, so I hurriedly packed my bags that night, and on the morning of the 9th, I had no choice but to leave.\" Mr. Wang said indignantly: \"The special agents use terror to persecute writers and cultural figures, trying to destroy culture. However, Chinese culture will never be destroyed and regress; it is bound to move forward. The more it is destroyed and suppressed, the more it will develop forward. Even if all the bookstores and newspaper offices in the Great Rear Area are closed by the rulers, and all the writers and cultural figures are killed by the rulers, the culture of the Liberated Areas, the pioneer of this new Chinese culture, will continue to lead the culture of the Great Rear Area forward.\" Talking about the lives of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Mr. Wang said with infinite emotion: \"Everywhere there are wars and plagues, and the people have eaten up even the bark and roots of trees. I saw that most of the land in Sichuan was barren, and the young men were all drafted. The fields have long been uncultivated. If I met Sichuan brothers who were deceived into fighting the civil war, I would tell them: 'Your fields are covered with thatch, and your mothers and wives are crying their eyes out, waiting for you to return!'\" Finally, when the reporter asked Mr. Wang what he thought after coming to the Liberated Areas, he said: \"The Liberated Areas are paradise, which I have long admired. Although I have just arrived, and have not yet personally experienced the lives of the people, seeing the people smiling everywhere along the way, my heart has already been liberated.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党阴谋绞杀文化界  诗人王亚平逃来边区  备述大后方政治黑暗民不聊生\n\n1946-08-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党阴谋绞杀文化界\n    诗人王亚平逃来边区\n    备述大后方政治黑暗民不聊生\n    【本报荷泽十四日电】进步诗人王亚平先生痛愤国民党的特务压迫，于八月九日由重庆辗转抵荷。记者往访时，见王先生在消瘦憔悴中显露喜悦之色，两目放光。他说：“国民党统治区已成鬼蜮世界。尤其是被追踪迫害的文化界人士，自从李公朴、闻一多先生被害后，到处风声鹤唳，许多文化界朋友无处藏身，国民党特务登记文化界之名单，分为四等：第一等地位较高，威望较大，年纪略老者，如郭沫若、张申府等；第二等为年纪较青，思想进步，活动能力强者，已死的陶行知为此等头名，被杀的李公朴、闻一多亦属此类；第三为思想动摇认识不清者；第四等为思想糊涂者。第一等特务认为年纪已老，活动时间不长，暂且留着。第二等则必须杀尽，不留一个。李闻就是被开刀的两位。第三等用金钱与官位收买。第四等让他活下去。现在重庆实际上已实行法西斯警管制，一日三查，特务登记之黑名单分为红卡片，黑卡片和白卡片，红卡片登记的仅杀无赦，黑卡片者待再考查，白卡片者暂时保留，七月初重庆市长张笃伦招待特务头子，开了一次所谓‘整顿重庆风纪’会议，重庆卫戍总司令王赞绪认为只有‘杀’字才能谈整顿，于是李闻被杀以后，重庆大批进步青年学生又遭杀害逮捕，现在昆明四十多杂志、报纸如民主周刊等，都被查封，上海也有许多杂志报纸，因当局密令印刷局不许出版而停刊。”\n    停了一会王先生激怒的说到他自己身上来，他说：“就连我在重庆报纸上编些诗刊，作几句诗，特务也日夜来追踪着我，在将离开重庆的时候，郭沫若先生去了上海，我住在郭先生的房子里，‘七七’纪念那天，特务布置大捣乱，在六号，一个黄衣警察来我家‘访问’，明明知道是我住的，他偏偏要问是谁住、干什么的？硬要我填表，连在那个学校教书，也要填上去。第二天是‘七七’，我避开了。八日晚上又是那位黄衣警察，还带来两位夹着短枪的便衣，在我家里左看右翻，问这问那，一个特务说：‘王先生你房子可好，让给我来住好不好？’我说：‘我住到那里去呢？特务凶凶的说：‘老子管你？’我知道情势严重，当天晚上急急收拾行李，九号早上只好被迫出走了。”王先生愤慨的说：“特务用恐怖手段迫害作家文化人，想摧残文化，但是，中国文化决不会被摧残而倒退，她是必然向前推进的。愈是破坏摧残，愈是向前发展，就算大后方的书店报馆完全被统治者关闭，作家文化人完全挨统治者杀害，但是解放区的文化，这个中国新文化的开辟者，她将继续领导着大后方的文化向前推进”。谈到国民党统治区老百姓的生活，王先生无限感慨的说：“到处兵灾瘟疫，老百姓连树皮草根都吃净了，我看见四川的土地大部荒芜了，年青的都被抽了丁，田地早没有人耕，要是我遇见被骗来打内战的四川兄弟，我会告诉他：‘你的田都长着茅草了，你的母亲老婆望着你回来，都哭得没有眼泪了！’最后记者问王先生到解放区后有何感想，他说：‘解放区是天堂，已羡慕久了，虽然刚来，老百姓的生活还未亲身体验，但一路来看见老百姓个个笑逐颜开，我的心灵已经解放了。’”"

The cotton planting area this year exceeds previous years. This year, 3 million mu of cotton were planted in central Hebei, doubling the amount from last year. In ten counties in western Hebei, including Yi County and Mancheng, a total of 400,000 mu of cotton were planted; Mancheng County alone planted over 10,000 mu, accounting for 20% of the county's cultivated land. Yi County has over 66,000 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 13% of the cultivated land. In addition, the rainfall has been suitable this year in various places, and the cotton bolls have already bloomed vigorously, providing sufficient raw materials for the folk textile industry.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 15th: Kedong, Baiquan, and Keshan counties in Heilongjiang Province, known as the granary of northern Manchuria, are expected to have a bumper harvest this year due to favorable weather conditions. Taking Qianfeng District in Kedong as an example, it has recently received continuous rain, the wheat ears are plump, the wheat grains are firm, and harvesting is imminent. According to experienced farmers, each qing (equivalent to 10 mu) of wheat can yield more than four shi this year; millet and broomcorn millet yielded about one shi per qing last year, and this year at least three shi can be harvested; corn can yield five shi even on ordinary land this year; potatoes yielded no harvest last year, and this year each qing can yield 12,000 jin (20 shi). In the vast fields of northern Manchuria, which were liberated not long ago, the wheat ears are plump, soybeans have partially blossomed, corn has grown red tassels, and broomcorn millet is also more than two chi tall. Looking around, there is a scene of joy. The farmers are all delighted and say: \"Since the establishment of the democratic government, all exorbitant taxes and levies have been abolished, and the bandits within the territory have been completely eliminated by the Democratic Allied Army. We have all been allocated the land of the enemy and puppets, and it is also a bumper year. We can have a 90% harvest, and every family can have surplus grain.

    "content": "[Handan, 16th Dispatch] Mr. Han Xiuli, a landlord and business tycoon in Wu'an City, recently donated a large quantity of materials worth 130 million yuan (legal tender), which he had buried underground for eight years during the enemy and puppet regime period. The materials included 400 barrels of kerosene, more than 160 bolts of foreign cloth, more than 100 bolts of homespun cloth, 68 barrels of block indigo and water indigo, more than 8,000 silver yuan, 20,000 catties of copper coins, 3,000 catties of alum, and 3,000 catties of alkali. He requested the government to transfer these items to the masses to settle the feudal exploitation accounts of his family in the past. Han's family had been in business for three generations and was a well-known landlord and commercial capitalist in Wu'an City, having run foreign cloth stores and money shops for many years. Since the launch of the mass movement of \"Land to the Tillers,\" Han deeply understood the various facts of his family's past exploitation of the masses. He voluntarily liquidated his assets and resolutely donated all the materials to repay the masses' blood and sweat debts, causing a sensation throughout the city, with people talking about it and spreading the news. The Wu'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County Government, after careful discussion and extensive solicitation of opinions from the masses, immediately sent a letter to Mr. Han expressing their commendation, stating: \"Welcoming private investment in the development of industry and commerce is a consistent policy of the democratic government. With the consent of the masses, apart from using a very small portion of the materials donated by Mr. Han to compensate the masses, the vast majority will be returned to Mr. Han, with the hope that he can use them to establish industrial and commercial enterprises and promote the development of the New Democratic economy.\" At the same time, it called on all businessmen in the county to learn from Han and invest all frozen assets in industry and commerce to generate profits. Mr. Han stated to the people afterwards: \"I deeply feel the authenticity of the democratic government's policies and the rationality of the mass movement. Therefore, I handed over these items to the masses to compensate for past losses. The government's leniency and the masses' forgiveness have deeply moved me. I am determined to use this batch of materials to open a machine spinning mill and, with the help of the government and the masses, jointly benefit society.\"\n\n[Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 14th Dispatch] Many enlightened landlords in Chahar Province have successively donated land. Chai Shulin, Commissioner of the Seventh Administrative Office of Chahar North and a member of the Chinese Communist Party, persuaded his grandfather to distribute 3,800 mu of ancestral land in Zhangbei and Kangbao to farmers for cultivation. Together with the 500 mu of land donated this spring to help disaster victims, he has donated a total of 4,200 mu of land. In Xidaimei Village, Zhangbei, 150 tenant households received an average of more than seven mu of land. Chai's relatives, Song Yujin and Song Yurui, and three other enlightened gentry members of the Song family, a prominent family in Chahar North, also promoted this glorious family tradition. After retaining sufficient land for their own cultivation, they successively donated more than 4,900 mu of land. When farmers in various places received land, they held enthusiastic gatherings to celebrate and sent letters to Commissioner Chai, expressing their great gratitude to him for his heroic dedication to the cause of national liberation over the past eight years and for now donating land to help farmers to stand up. They all believed that the Communist Party is truly the savior of the peasants. Dong Defeng, an enlightened landlord in Zhuolu Xin'anbao, happily told his friends after donating 278 mu of fertile land and 68 houses: \"The landlord class relies on farmers to live a life of extravagance and pleasure, which is a great injustice in history. Now, living by my own management is much more pleasant.\" Liu Shengzhuan, a government supervisor, retained 15 mu of land for his family of six to cultivate themselves, and distributed all the remaining 110 mu of rented land to poor farmers for cultivation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武安地主商业巨子自动清算  韩修礼先生献埋藏物资  政府致函嘉勉并退还大部望继续工商投资察省专员作模范开明地主纷纷献田\n\n1946-08-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武安地主商业巨子自动清算\n    韩修礼先生献埋藏物资\n    政府致函嘉勉并退还大部望继续工商投资察省专员作模范开明地主纷纷献田\n    【邯郸十六日电】武安城地主兼商业界巨子韩修礼先生，于日前将其在敌伪统治时期埋藏地下八年的价值一万万三千万元（法币）的大批物资，计煤油四百桶，洋布百六十余匹，土布百余匹，块靛及水靛六十八桶，银洋八千余元，铜元二万斤，白矾三千斤，碱三千斤等献出，请政府转给群众，清算其家庭过去的封建剥削账目。韩三代营商，为武安城内著名的地主兼商业资本家，开设洋布庄、钱庄多年。自耕者有其田的群众翻身运动开展以来，韩深明自己的家庭过去对群众剥削的种种事实，自动清算，毅然献出全部物资，偿还群众的血汗债，一时轰动全城，街谈巷议纷纷传颂。中共武安县委及县府于经过慎重讨论，并广泛征求群众意见，当即致函韩先生表示嘉勉，并称：“欢迎私人投资发展工商业，乃民主政府一贯政策。现经群众同意，除以先生所献物资之极小部分偿还群众外，其余绝大部分仍退还先生，望能以之兴办工商实业，推进新民主主义经济发展。”同时并号召全县商人向韩学习，把冻结资财都投入工商业中生利。韩先生事后向人民表示：“我深感民主政府政策的真实与群众运动的合理，故以此物交还群众以偿往日损失。政府之宽大与群众的原宥使我深深感动。我决心以这批物资开办一机器纺纱，在政府与群众帮助下共同造福于社会。”\n    【新华社宣化十四日电】察省许多开明地主纷纷献田。察北七专署专员，中共党员柴书林说服乃爷，将张北康保两地祖田三千八百余亩，分配给农民耕种，连同今春捐助灾民土地五百亩共已献田四千二百余亩。张北西大每村一百五十户佃农，平均获得七亩多地。柴专员亲属察北望族宋玉金、宋玉瑞等五位开明士绅，亦发挥此一光荣族风，除留足够之自耕地外，相继献田四千九百余亩。各地农民获得土地时，均热烈集会庆祝，纷纷致函柴专员，对他八年来英勇献身民族解放事业，今又捐献田产帮助农民翻身表示极大谢忱，咸认共产党才真是农民的救星。涿鹿新保安开明地主董德峰，献出良田二百七十八亩，房屋六十八间后，愉快的对朋友说：“地主阶级依靠农民而驱侈逸乐的过活，这是历史上的大不公平。现在靠自己经营来过生活，心境可畅快多了。”政府督学刘盛转，全家六口人留地十五亩自耕，其余一百一十亩租田全部分给贫苦农民耕种。"

The Soviet representative, Derevyanko, strongly refuted this, pointing out that the US representative's move was an act of bad faith in violation of international agreements, and declared that the Allied Council for Japan had no right to discuss this issue, which should be submitted to the four governments for consultation. After Derevyanko's speech, Acheson tried to get the Kuomintang representative to support him, asking Zhu Shimin to state his position. Zhu hesitated for a long time, looking very embarrassed, and just chuckled repeatedly. The British representative, Ball, said he would not consider it. At this point, Acheson became angry and shouted, \"The order of our meetings is often disrupted by a certain member state.\" The Soviet representative then rebuked him again, saying, \"It is you, Mr. Acheson, who has often disrupted order in the past, and you are doing so again today.\"\n　　\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: A spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 13th, condemning the Yoshida Cabinet's land reform plan announced on the 11th, declaring that Yoshida's plan, under the guise of \"land reform,\" is merely a continuation of the feudal landlords' exploitation. Yoshida's plan stipulates that Japanese farmers will have two and a half acres of cultivated land, which will not liberate Japan's impoverished small farmers.

Romanian Foreign Minister Tatarescu delivered a speech on the afternoon of the 13th, expressing Romania's determination to implement the draft peace treaty. Bulgarian Prime Minister Georgiev delivered a speech on the morning of the 11th, declaring that Bulgaria's traitors had been severely punished by the People's Court; Georgiev believed that Bulgaria, like Italy, should have the same right to be regarded as a country at war with Germany. Regarding Greece's territorial claims against Bulgaria, Georgiev declared: Greece is attempting to invade Bulgaria and demand Bulgarian territory. Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi spoke on the afternoon of the 14th, and Finnish Prime Minister Pekkala spoke on the morning of the 15th. The focus of both speeches was on territorial border issues and relations with neighboring countries. After the statements by the representatives of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, the plenary session proceeded with general speeches. Representatives of South Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union all spoke yesterday afternoon. In his speech, Molotov formally raised his opposition to postponing the Peace Conference. Since yesterday, Wang Shijie, the representative of the Kuomintang government, has served as chairman of the plenary session (Note: The chairman of the plenary session is rotated among the representatives of France, the United States, China, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, each serving for four days).\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: TASS reported: The characteristic of the Paris Peace Conference on the morning of the 13th was that Benaš, acting as chairman, again violated the conference procedure without reason. On the 12th, after the US and British delegations failed to prevent the Soviet representative from speaking, Benaš declared that anyone wishing to speak would be put on the list. The Soviet representative was the first to request to speak. Benaš said: \"I am very happy to put Mr. Molotov on the list of speakers for tomorrow morning,\" but when the meeting opened on the morning of the 13th, Benaš did not announce the agenda or the list of speakers, but suddenly said that he would not let the Soviet representative speak, but let the Abyssinian representative speak. It is said that the Abyssinian representative requested it earlier, although this was not mentioned on the 12th. Benaš's words were very strange, because the Abyssinian representative was absent at the beginning of the meeting and could not speak. Soviet representative Vyshinsky requested that the chairman should lead the plenary session in accordance with the procedure. He said that recent meeting experience showed that many misunderstandings arose because some representatives did not know what the agenda for the day was. Benaš replied with an unfounded statement that he had not yet received the agenda from the secretariat. Since the Abyssinian representative was still absent, Benaš had to invite Molotov to speak. The audience listened attentively to Molotov's speech and applauded from time to time.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Paris dispatch: The two subcommittees of the Italian Peace Treaty held their first meetings on the evening of the 13th. At the meeting of the Italian Political and Territorial Committee (First Committee), the United States and the Soviet Union again disputed over procedural issues. A few minutes after the meeting began, American representative Dunn suddenly proposed that the committee approve a motion not to elect any representative of a major power as the rapporteur of the committee.

Former U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ickes, in the New York Sun, condemned the American press for failing to publish the true news from the Philippines. After announcing that a civil war was underway there, Ickes pointed out that Roxas was not only using American weapons to suppress the People's Anti-Japanese Army, but was also attempting to eliminate all opposition through a series of anti-democratic measures. Undoubtedly, someone will demand the mobilization of U.S. troops stationed in the Philippines to \"suppress the riots\" and protect the Roxas government they have established. What a beautiful action this is! American troops are defending the Philippine dictatorial regime behind an iron curtain. There are now 90,000 American troops in the Philippines and 25,000 Filipino indigenous soldiers have been recruited. What reason does the United States have to maintain 115,000 troops in the Philippines? In 1935, the total number of U.S. standing army troops was only 138,000. Radio commentator Volger sternly criticized the U.S. policy of maintaining Roxas, saying: The reason the United States prefers Roxas is because Roxas is a conservative. Mr. Alba, in \"Far Eastern Review,\" wrote an article criticizing the United States for participating in the suppression of the People's Anti-Japanese Army, pointing out that just before the declaration of \"independence,\" the U.S. military had provided Roxas with $50 million worth of military equipment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美当局在菲扶植独裁政权  帮助反动派打内战  美国民主人士著文谴责\n\n1946-08-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美当局在菲扶植独裁政权\n    帮助反动派打内战\n    美国民主人士著文谴责\n    【新华社延安十六日电】据塔斯社纽约十二日电：美国民主人士多人撰文谴责美国当局在菲律滨扶植独裁政权帮助反动派进行内战。美国前内长伊克斯在纽约太阳报上谴责美国报界未登载菲律滨的真实消息，伊克斯在宣布那里内战在进行中之后，指出罗哈斯不但利用美国的武器镇压人民抗日军，而且经过一连串的反民主措施，企图消灭一切反对派。无疑的，有人会要求动员驻防菲岛的美国军队来“镇压骚乱”，保护被他们建立起来的罗哈斯政府。这是多么漂亮的一种行动呀！美国军队在保卫着铁幕后面的菲独裁政权。现在菲律滨有九万美军，并已征幕了二万五千菲土著兵。什么理由美国要在菲维持十一万五千军队呢？一九三五年，美国常备军通共不过十三万八千人。无线电评论家伏德格严斥美国维护罗哈斯的政策，他说：美国所以宁愿要罗哈斯，乃因为罗哈斯是保守分子。阿尔巴拉氏在“远东评论”撰文斥责美国参加了对人民抗日军的镇压，指出恰在宣布“独立”之前，美军曾增罗哈斯以价值五千万美元的军事装备。"

After the Ministry of Commerce ordered price reductions in commercial stores at the beginning of this month, prices have been reduced by an average of 40%. Some goods have been further discounted by 25% after the price reduction, resulting in crowded stores, indicating that Soviet people can now purchase items that are somewhat more expensive than rationed goods. The monthly salary of Soviet technicians has increased from 800 rubles before the war to 3,000 rubles. Many farmers visit towns during holidays to shop in commercial stores. Three months ago, farmers purchased a large number of public bonds with cash, indicating their substantial income. The income of workers and professionals is more than enough to purchase rationed goods. In ration stores, a pair of leather shoes costs only 150 to 190 rubles, and a cloth jacket costs only 300 rubles. The Soviet government is now striving to abolish all rationing, which is a feature of the post-war five-year plan. The recent price reductions in commercial stores are intended to gradually lower the prices of goods in non-rationed stores until they are equal to those of rationed goods.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Washington dispatch: The White House recently released a statement from the Department of Commerce stating that in the sixteen days following the abolition of price controls on June 30th, the prices of twenty-eight major commodities rose by more than 25%. The prices of grains, beef, butter, lead, and copper are already higher than after the end of World War I in 1919. The details of the recent overall price increase have not yet been fully clarified, and the price surge has not yet subsided. If the Office of Price Administration is not restored, the surge may be even worse than it is today.

    "content": "Jiang's Tyranny is More Ferocious than Tigers and Wolves\n    ——People in the Kuomintang Areas of Ji and Qi Groan on the Brink of Starvation\n    Li Ziru\n    \"As soon as the sun shows its face, it's covered by clouds again. Damn it, it's still a dark world.\" This is a very apt judgment of the Kuomintang's rule by a citizen of Jixian County.\n\n    After the Japanese surrender, the most distinct and painful feeling given to people by all the measures of the Kuomintang government can be expressed in two popular rhyming phrases: \"Building bunkers, digging trenches, heavy labor; demanding grain and firewood, unclear burdens.\" The Kuomintang army's construction of fortifications has never stopped, especially since Du Xiyao (Kuomintang Magistrate of Jixian County) and Sun Dianying attended the \"Security Conference\" in Zhengzhou in May. The Kuomintang authorities have been conscripting labor and materials on a large scale, planning to build 277 large bunkers throughout Jixian County. City walls, street intersections, and important market towns are all woven into a dense network of bunkers. On transportation lines, three bunkers were added to each interval in the bunker lines left by the Japanese. The most interesting thing is the Wangjing Tower in Jixian City, a historical site left by Prince Lu of the Ming Dynasty, which is about twice as high as the city wall. However, the mixed Japanese-Jiang army (the New Fifth Army) forcibly assigned the task of building a bunker on it to the northeast township. According to ancient legends, many craftsmen died to build the Wangjing Tower. Unexpectedly, this story is being repeated today. How can the township head not be anxious? As a result, he sent 300,000 silver dollars to \"smooth things over.\"\n\n    During the wheat harvest season, which farmers call the \"golden period,\" each bao (a unit of local administration) still had to send twenty or thirty people to work every day. Therefore, in these days, most villages were hiring people to work with one dou of wheat per day. The completion of each bunker is a crystallization of the people's blood, sweat, and tears. According to the people's calculations, the materials needed for a bunker, such as wood, stone, bricks, tiles, labor, and entertainment expenses, amount to about 200 shi of wheat. In order to ensure that their workers suffer less and do less unjust work, each bao regards entertainment as an indispensable means, and it is a considerable sum of money. Liangcun Village in Qixian County was ordered to dig a railway ditch for the 30th Army, one zhang and five chi deep (originally one zhang deep), and fifteen zhang long. After three days, because the deadline was exceeded, the thirty-two workers were kept there to work day and night and were not allowed to go back. Later, the bao head sent two baskets of eggs (six to seven hundred), three bottles of wine (nine jin), five jin of pork, a large basket of foreign cigarettes (ten large packs), and two large baskets of white flour and ten pairs of shoes before they were allowed to stop digging.\n\n    The people are forced to perform this kind of hard labor. In their hearts, they have long understood what the Kuomintang army wants to do and foresee its future. The old people of Jixian County said: \"In the past, the Japanese also asked them to build bunkers and dig trenches. When the bunkers were built and the trenches were dug, Japan also lost. Now the Central Army is doing the same!\" Some people said: \"Let them build it. They want to fight the Eighth Route Army, but they can't withstand the Eighth Route Army's artillery.\"\n\n    The amount of burden on the people under the Kuomintang rule is even more appalling. The Kuomintang's exorbitant taxes and levies are levied everywhere and exist in every industry. A person selling zongzi in Jixian City paid more than 50,000 yuan in taxes in three months in the spring. The poorest citizens without houses or land had to pay at least three to four thousand yuan per month for the door tax (also called the pot bottom tax). After the wheat harvest this year, Zhang Guqing, the president of the Jixian Chamber of Commerce, convened a meeting of various businesses and announced that each business would be assessed 300,000 yuan. Even the smallest shop would be assessed two or three shares, and each payment would be tens of thousands to one million yuan. Most small and medium-sized businesses could not support it and closed down one after another. The stores that have closed down include Qingfenglong (owner Song Junqing), a sundry shop on the east side of Nanma Market Street, and a foreign goods store (owner Zhou Shanping) on the east side of the same street, a sundry shop (owner Mr. Zhang) behind the Yuandi Temple on the east side of Beima Market Street, and a sundry shop (owner Zhang Jinrong) behind the theater on Yanshou Palace Street. In addition, the news of continued business closures is heard every day.\n\n    The burden on Yantun Bao in the northeast township of Jixian County (the bao is 20 miles away from the city, has five natural villages, and has 60 mu of land) in the six months from the first month of the lunar calendar to the present is as follows:\n\n    Wheat 3.8 dou (calculated per mu, the same below), firewood 80 jin, grass 60 jin. The above 80 jin of firewood is equivalent to 5330 yuan in legal tender, and 60 jin of grass is equivalent to 4000 yuan in legal tender. Wheat is calculated at the market price of 2700 yuan per dou at the time, and firewood and grass are converted into 3.45 dou of wheat. Adding the 3.8 dou of wheat levied per mu, the actual burden per mu is 7.25 dou of wheat (including the 2 dou of wheat levied per mu after the wheat harvest this year), equivalent to 217.5 jin in the market scale (30 jin per dou). However, the highest yield per mu this wheat season was only 3 dou. However, after the masses paid such a large amount of burden, they still could not clear the Kuomintang's most recent levy. After the wheat harvest, the Kuomintang levied the following on the bao at one time:\n\n    80,000 jin of wheat, 800,000 yuan for the commissioner's clothing expenses, 7 telegraph poles (2 dou of wheat per pole), 50 pairs of shoes (1 dou of wheat per pair), building a pillbox (equivalent to about 200 shi of wheat), and building a barrack room.\n\n    The amount that the bao has already borne after the wheat harvest this year (2 dou of wheat per mu) can only pay for half of this levy. Most of the rest is used to repay old debts and miscellaneous entertainment expenses. Landlords, local bullies, and bao officials deposit money in the bao before the wheat harvest (most of the money comes from corruption), and convert it into wheat at a low price. Now they want to get it back with a double profit (one becomes two).\n\n    However, under the Kuomintang's predatory policy of taking whatever they want, some people are embarking on the road to wealth, namely local bullies, bao ruffians, usurers, and those who work in Kuomintang military and political organs. They work diligently and make money on paper, trying to transfer the burden to the vast number of honest farmers, and they also seize huge profits from it. They add five sheng of wheat in other places (that is, five sheng of profit per dou), and put it in the bao to get a profit of two and a half times (that is, two and a half dou per dou). Bao officials get four dou of wheat per month as salary, but they do not donate money themselves, and deposit it in the bao to get two and a half times the wheat. The money they put in the bao is converted into one dou of wheat at 1,500 yuan (the market price at the time was 2,000 yuan per dou), and after the wheat harvest, they get two and a half times the wheat (the market price after the wheat harvest was 2,700 yuan per dou). Large usurers are mostly concentrated in Qixian County, such as Lianghang Dachang, F茂, Hongchang, Hongqingyuan, Zhonghexing (the money lending shop opened by Beiyang's rich man in the city, his accounts are mostly in the southeast township of Qixian County), as well as Wang Laohan, Sun Yanxiu (from Wangzhuang), etc. are all big nests of usurers. This year, in the rural areas of Qixian County, in addition to the plunder by the Kuomintang authorities, they also plundered a large part. During the wheat threshing season, 32 carts of usurers gathered in Huangdui Village one day to collect wheat debts.\n\n    The fruits of the masses' hard work throughout the year are plundered away before they even see them, and they can hardly live. The farmers in Huangdui Liangxiang area eat oatmeal paste every day to fill their stomachs in this hot and busy summer season (when they should eat white flour and good food), and they have no money to buy even the vegetables and salt for seasoning. In order to avoid and reduce further burdens, they are selling their land to the government and public organizations. They have also created a strange example of selling land that has never been heard of before, that is, they hand over the land to government agencies, etc., and pay back three sheng of wheat or 200 yuan in legal tender per mu. Farmers in Liangxiang sold 12 qing of land in this situation (the land can yield 200 jin of grain per mu per year), which can reduce the Ding Yin (poll tax) by about 60 liang. Now the Qixian County Government, the National Corps, Xigang Middle School, Nanguan Primary School and other institutions are buying such land on a large scale. According to people from the National Corps, the organs and groups have now purchased about 20,000 mu of such land (equivalent to 1,000 taels of silver), and the most realistic thing is that 600 shi of wheat have already reached their pockets.\n\n    On the other hand, local ruffians, hooligans, combined with marauding soldiers and defeated troops, constantly rise up to rob and disturb the people. A soldier of the New Fifth Army in Jixian County stalked a farmer (near Liyuan Town, Jixian County) who had 50,000 yuan with him, chasing him for more than ten miles, but failed to rob him due to bad luck. In the Huangdui Liangxiang area, the quilts and clothes taken off by farmers watching the wheat fields at night are often stolen by robbers when they fall asleep. A man surnamed Wang in Liangxiang lost two sets of clothes in this way. When robbers do such things, they cover the eyes of the victims with mud.\n\n    In this world of hunger, poverty, corruption, exploitation, and banditry, people have developed a strong hatred for the Kuomintang rulers.\n\n    \"The Japanese are teachers, and the Central Army is their apprentices. Now the Central Army has surpassed the teachers.\"\n\n    \"The Japanese left behind bad seeds, and the Central Army came out, which is even more fierce than the Japanese.\" The old people in Huangdui area of Qixian County said.\n\n    \"Bastards! You have to squeeze the people dry even if they don't eat or drink.\" The women in Chengguan, Jixian County said.\n\n    The poor citizens of Jixian County said: \"Let the Eighth Route Army come over, we can only survive if the Eighth Route Army comes over!\"\n\n                                                          End\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋家暴政赛虎狼——汲、淇国民党区人民呻吟在饥饿线上\n李自如\n1946-08-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋家暴政赛虎狼\n    ——汲、淇国民党区人民呻吟在饥饿线上\n    李自如\n    “太阳刚一露头，又被云彩遮住了。他妈个屄，还是黑暗世界”。这是汲县城的一个市民，对国民党的统治，下的很恰当的断语。\n    日寇投降后，国民党政府的一切措施，给予人最明确最痛苦的感触，可以用老百姓说的两句谐语表达出来：“修碉堡，挖战沟，差事繁重；要粮款，和柴草，负担不清。”国民党军修筑工事，根本没有间歇过，特别是自五月间杜希尧（汲县国民党县长）及孙殿英到郑州开过“治安会议”以后，国民党当局征工征料，大兴土工，计划汲县全境修筑二百七十七个大碉堡，城垣周围，街衢要口，重要集镇，都被围织在稠密的碉堡网里。交通线上在日寇留下的碉堡线的每一个间隔里，又增添三个碉堡。最有趣的是汲县城里有个望京楼，这是明朝潞王遗留下来的古迹，比城墙高出约两倍，可是蒋日混合造的四路军（即新五军），却硬分派给东北乡在那上面修碉堡。在古人传说里，为了修建望京楼不知死了多少工匠，不意这个故事却又在今日重演，这怎能叫乡长不着急？结果送了三十万礼洋把这件事情“疏通”了。\n    庄稼汉称为“黄金时期”的麦收季节，各保每天仍得派二三十人去做工，所以在这几天，大多数的乡村，是每天出一斗麦子雇人去做工的。每一个碉堡的完成，都是人民的血泪汗的结晶，据群众的计算，一个碉堡所需的木、石、砖、瓦、工等料及应酬送礼等费，约合二百石麦子，各保为了使自己的工人少受气，少做冤工，应酬送礼成了必不可少的手段，而且是数目相当大的一笔款子。淇县梁乡村给三十军挖铁路沟，叫挖一丈五尺深（原有一丈深），十五丈长，三天到头，因逾了期限未完工，三十二个工人，留在那里昼夜做工，不放回去，后来保长送去鸡蛋两篮（六七百），酒三瓶（九斤），猪肉五斤，洋烟一大篮（十大包），白面两大篮，鞋十双，才算不叫挖了。\n    人民被迫服这种苦役，心里边早就明白了国民党军要干什么，并预示着他的前途，汲县的老百姓说：“从前日本人就是叫给他修碉堡，挖战沟，等到碉堡修好了，战沟挖齐了，日本也败了，现在中央军又是这样！”又有人说：“叫他修吧，他要打八路，可吃不住八路军的大炮一炮敲”。\n    人民在国民党统治下的负担数目，更是惊人，国民党的苛捐杂税，是无处不征，无行不有。汲县城一个卖粽子的在春天三个月中即出捐五万多元；无房无地最贫苦的市民每月出门头捐（也叫锅底捐）至少也得三四千元。今年麦后，汲县商务会长张谷青召集各商号开会，宣布了商号每分派款三十万元，而商人最小的铺面起码也够上二三分，一次出款即须数十万至一百万，一般中小商号不能支持纷纷闭门歇业。已停业的有南马市街路东碎货铺庆丰隆（掌柜宋俊卿）及同街路东的一个洋货庄（掌柜周善平），北马市街元帝庙后路东的一个碎货铺（掌柜张某），延寿宫街戏楼后路东的一个碎货铺（掌柜张金熔）等，此外继续停业的正日有所闻。\n    汲县东北乡阎屯保（该保距城二十里，共辖五个自然村，有土地六十顷）从旧历正月到现在的六个月中，负担数目如下：\n    麦子三斗八升（以每亩计算，下同），木柴八十斤，草六十斤。以上木柴八十斤，合法币五三三○元，草六十斤，合法币四○○○元，麦子以当时市价每斗二七○○元计算，柴草共折麦子三斗四升五合，加上每亩派麦三斗八升，实际每亩共负担麦子七斗二升五合（内有今年麦后派的每亩二斗麦子），合市秤二一七斤半（每斗三十斤），而今年麦季最高的收成，每亩不过三斗。可是群众支付了如此数目的负担以后，并不能将国民党最近一次的征派偿清，麦后国民党对该保一次的征派就有：\n    麦子八○○○○斤，专署服装费八○○○○○元，电线杆七根（每根二斗麦子），鞋五○双（每双一斗麦子），修建炮楼一个（约合二百石麦子），修建兵房一间。\n    该保今年麦后已经负担的数目（每亩派麦二斗），只能偿付这次征派的半数，其余大部分都用于偿还旧欠，及杂化应酬上了，地主、土劣、及保办事人，麦前存到保中的款子（款子大都由贪污得来），以贱价折成麦子，现在要以二倍的利得回去（一个得两个）。\n    但在国民党这种予取予求的掠夺政策下，有些人却走上发财大道，那就是土劣、保棍、高利贷主及在国民党军政机关作事的人，他们心眼里做事，笔头上生财，设法把负担转到广大的老实农民身上，自己又从中攫取大利，他们在别处加五揭麦（即一斗加五升的利），放到保中以二倍半得利（即一斗得二斗半），保办事人，每月薪麦四斗，自己捐款不出，存到保中，也以二倍半得麦，他们放到保中的款子，以一千五百元折一斗麦子（当时市价每斗二千元），麦后又以二倍半得麦子（麦后每斗市价二千七百元），大的高利贷主多集中在淇县城，如粮行大昌、福茂、宏昌、宏庆源，中和祥（北杨财主在城内开的放账铺，他的账大都在淇县东南乡）以及王老汉，孙延秀（王庄人）等都是高利贷的大窝主，今年淇县农村的麦子，除国民党当局掠夺外，他们也掠夺一大部分，打麦场时，黄堆村一天曾聚集高利贷主们三十二辆大车讨麦债。\n    群众一年辛苦得来的果实，不见影即被人家掠夺了去，他们很难生活下去了。黄堆梁乡一带的农民，在这酷热和农忙的大暑天（照例应当吃白面好饭的季节），每天喝大麦面糊糊来充饥，连就饭的菜，调味的盐，也无钱购买，他们为着避免和减轻再负担，把地纷纷出卖给政府和公共团体。他们卖地的方法，也开了亘古未闻的奇例，即把地交给政府等机关，每亩倒贴三升麦子或二百元法币。梁乡农民就在这样的情况下卖掉土地十二顷（该地每亩每年能收粮二百斤），约可卸下丁银六十两，现在淇县县政府，国民兵团，西岗中学，南关小学等机关，正大肆收买此种土地，出卖者有贫农、中农、地主等，以中农为最多。地区上以淇县南部为最多，淇东、东南、东北各乡也有一部分，据国民兵团的人谈称，各机关团体现已收买此种土地约二万亩（合一千两银），这些官僚阔绅，不费吹毛之力，即夺得如此巨数的土地，而且最现实的是已经有六百石麦子到了他们的荷包里。\n    另一方面，地痞、流氓，结合着乱兵残勇，不断起来打路打劫，搅扰人民，汲县新五军的一个士兵，曾对一个带有五万元的农民（汲县李源镇附近的）盯梢，一直追了十几里，因机遇不好，打劫未成。黄堆梁乡一带，夜间看麦场的农民，当他们睡熟以后，身上盖的被子及脱下的衣服，常被劫徒们偷走，梁乡一个姓王的就这样连丢了两身衣服。劫徒们行这种事情时，用污泥污住被劫者的眼睛。\n    在这个饥饿贫困，贪污剥削，盗匪抢劫，交织起来的世界里，人们对国民党统治者发生了强烈的憎恶。\n    “日本人是老师，中央军是徒弟，现在中央军已经淤师了。”\n    “日本人丢下了坏种子，出了个中央军，比日本还厉害”。淇县黄堆一带的老百姓说。\n    “王八孙！老百姓，不吃不喝也得给恁弄。”汲县城关的妇女们说。\n    汲县的贫苦市民说：“八路军过来吧，八路军过来才能活下去！”\n                                                          完"

Nine out of ten homes are empty, and the area is covered with wormwood. According to the Kaifeng China Times, \"Large armies (referring to Chiang's army) are gathered in the area, and the supplies are enormous, and the people's cries of suffering are endless.\" Due to military service occupying farmland, this year's summer wheat yield is only four dou per mu at most. However, before the wheat is even dried, the Baozhang (village head) is already going door to door urging the payment of military grain, amounting to three and a half dou per mu. The issue of wheat seeds for this autumn has become a major problem. There are more than thirty types of apportionments in the villages. In Guzhang Village, which has more than 200 households, more than 7,000 jin of wheat, more than 20,700 jin of millet, 1,000 jin of cotton yarn, 650 zhang of homespun cloth, 280 jin of cotton, 40 pairs of military shoes, 100 bullets, and 130,000 yuan (legal tender) were collected in just over three months. Other requisitions such as bricks, tiles, wood, and adobe for building bunkers, as well as the requisition of vegetables and firewood, etc., amount to more than 1.15 million yuan (legal tender). Items such as tables, chairs, basins, bowls, clothing, and bedding that were requisitioned are not included. Many strong men have been forcibly conscripted, and the old and weak must also serve in the labor force. Most of the twenty qing of land in Guzhang is barren. The local people live in hardship, robberies are increasing daily, and they yearn day and night for our army to rescue them. (Zhou Zhenshan, Jun)\n　　[Dispatch from Handan, 15th] Refugees and fleeing landlords returning to the liberated areas via Anyang are often detained and obstructed by Kuomintang special agents. Kuomintang special agents use all sorts of despicable means such as threats, inducements, rumors, and intimidation to prevent them from returning to their hometowns. When their plots fail, they use counterfeit Hebei currency to forcibly exchange the legal tender they carry. The Kuomintang special agents have two aims: first, to defraud them of their money and prevent them from returning home; second, to promote counterfeit currency through them and disrupt the financial market in our liberated areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 辉县平原蒿藜遍野  蒋军苛征暴敛如火急  人民日夜盼望我军解倒悬安阳国特荼毒逃亡地主\n\n1946-08-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　辉县平原蒿藜遍野\n    蒋军苛征暴敛如火急           \n    人民日夜盼望我军解倒悬安阳国特荼毒逃亡地主\n    【本报长治讯】作为反动派进攻解放区前进阵地的辉县平原地区，人民遭受了空前的兵灾，十室九空，蒿藜遍野。据开封中国时报载称：“该地大军（指蒋军）云集，供应浩繁，人民叫苦之声不绝于耳”。由于军差荒地，今年夏麦每亩最高仅收四斗，但麦子尚未晒干，保长即沿门催缴军粮，每亩达三斗半，今秋麦种已成大问题。村中各种摊派有名目者达三十余种。二百多户的古章村，三个多月即征麦子七千余斤，小米二万零七百多斤，花料千斤，土布六百五十丈，棉花二百八十斤，军鞋四十双，子弹一百发，款十三万元（法币），其他征派建筑碉堡之砖瓦，木料，土坯以及征发菜蔬、柴草等物折合法币达一百一十五万余元之巨。而被征发之桌椅，盆碗，衣被等物尚不在内。壮丁多被强征，老弱还须应差，古章二十顷土地大部荒芜。当地人民生活困苦，劫案日多，日夜盼望我军去解救他们。（周振山、军）\n    【邯郸十五日电】经安阳回解放区之难民及逃亡地主，经常为国民党特务扣留阻难。国民党特务以威胁、利诱、造谣、恐吓等种种卑鄙手段阻碍彼等还乡，奸计不售时即以伪造之冀钞强换彼等所带之法币。国特之企图有二：一为诈骗钱财，使彼等不得返乡；一为通过彼等推行假钞，扰乱我解放区金融市场。"

The few remaining old and weak people in the town slowly emerged from the empty alleys, weeping and appealing to us as if we were their own relatives. After comforting and questioning them, we learned that before the Yan army retreated, they spread rumors saying: After they retreated, the central government's planes would use atomic bombs to flatten Laiyuan, and ordered the people to evacuate completely, otherwise they would be considered \"traitors.\" On July 25th, they began arresting young men and sending them to Xiang Zihong, and in a few days, more than 200 people were arrested from Laiyuan Town and Nanshan Tou village. Civilian livestock and carts were also seized. The first thing they looted was grain, searching every household, confiscating even a single liter or a single scoop. The second step was to loot the goods in the stores, and finally, they searched every house for farm tools and furniture, transporting them to Xiang Zihong day and night, even large pots were robbed. Those items that could not be transported were destroyed. Three days before the Yan army retreated (that is, on the 28th), they ordered the people to evacuate, whipping them to get them on the road. The cries shook the sky, the terror was tragic, rarely seen in ancient and modern times. In addition to allocating grain for emergency relief to the remaining old and weak in Laiyuan, our Qixian Command has ordered the entire county's armed forces to strengthen their siege of the Yan puppet regime in order to rescue the forced masses. At the same time, a large number of leaflets were distributed to expose the Yan puppet's rumors, publicize our policies, and call on those who were driven away to find ways to escape back. Currently, the county's independent battalion and militia joint defense team have been deployed near Zihong and are actively engaged. The Yushe militia company, led by Director Li of the county's Armed Forces Committee, has also rushed to reinforce them.

The public servants of the Yellow River Commission's Hebei Repair and Defense Office stationed in the city jointly accused Jiang's army of being rude and unreasonable, forcibly occupying the Yellow River Commission's residence as a battlefield, and imprisoning the survey team and technician Zhang Senrong and more than 20 others, fearing that they would \"collude with the bandits\" and leak information. They said, \"We only gained freedom after you came.\" One of the staff members was wounded by Jiang's army, and our medical team immediately treated him.

Everywhere in the streets and alleys were cries of unwillingness to fight the civil war. In this situation, the morale of the troops was extremely depressed. Finally, Regiment Commander Xu said, \"Laying down our weapons is something we had expected long ago, and it is also our only way out. From now on, we will break away from the bitter sea of civil war, start anew with the people, and I am sincerely relieved.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 兰封城内人民  控诉蒋军内战罪行  蒋军许支庆团长慨谈内战痛苦\n\n1946-08-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　兰封城内人民\n    控诉蒋军内战罪行\n    蒋军许支庆团长慨谈内战痛苦\n    【本报荷泽十六日电】陇海沿线我军解放兰封后，城内人民纷向我军哭诉蒋军打内战带给人民的巨大灾难，一致要求我军继续前进解放全线。驻于该城之黄委会河北修防处公务人员，向我军联名控诉蒋军横蛮无理，强迫占领黄委会驻地，作为战场，把测量队及技师张森荣等二十余人，囚禁起来，怕他们“通匪”走漏消息。他们说：“你们来了，我们才有了自由”。其中有一位职员被蒋军击伤，我卫生队立即予以医治，黄委会全体人员对我军保护了他们的安全，表示衷心的感谢。又行总河南分署仓库主任张英俊等二十余人，亦以我军保护他们安全表示谢意。\n    【本报荷泽十七日电】十四日，记者走访在兰封放下武器首批到达冀鲁豫军区政治部招待所之原西北军三十八军五十五师七十四旅二百二十团团长许支庆等五位军官，许团长沉痛地说：“抗战八年，始终在第一线与敌作战，胜利之后盼有一独立、和平、民主之新中国出现，结果被蒋介石欺骗北来，进行卖国反共内战，违背自己良心，打自己同胞，故一经战斗即行放下武器”。继谈渠驻兰封城内，目睹人民怨声载道，甚至以为不如往日日寇统治时期，街头巷尾到处是不愿打内战的呼声，在此情况下，部队士气沮丧到达极点。末后，许团长说：“放下武器，是我们早已预料的事，也是我们唯一生路，从此脱离内战苦海，与民更始，个人衷心欣慰无已。”"

The administrative office has urgently appealed to UNRRA and CNRRA for prompt relief to save the 140,000 affected people. Weixian is the most severely affected. Except for some sorghum that may be salvaged, the crops have been completely destroyed. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 314 villages in the seven counties have been flooded, affecting 145,981 people, inundating over one million mu of land, and destroying 9,451 houses. In addition, YuanCheng and Fudong, in the First and Fifth Administrative Regions, have also experienced flooding. These large numbers of disaster victims urgently need relief. The Southern Hebei Administrative Office is conducting investigations and providing emergency relief while appealing to UNRRA and CNRRA to send personnel to the disaster areas for inspection and to provide reasonable relief based on the severity of the situation. According to investigations, the relief effort requires approximately 530 million yuan, over 2 million jin of rice, and over 5 million jin of wheat.\n\n[From Our Correspondent in Heze] Since the beginning of the fu period, continuous heavy rains have caused flooding in the eastern part of Kunshan (a newly established county between Dongping and ShouZhang). Half of the county's fields and crops have been submerged. On July 20th, a surge of rainwater from the Dongping Lake area turned over twenty villages, including Jinshan Dam, into a watery expanse, completely submerging the fields and crops, and collapsing many houses. On July 23rd, three more surges of rainwater flooded many fields and gardens.

    "content": "Spokesperson of the Beiping CCP Delegation Answers Reporters\n    Truth of Obstructed Mediation of Anping Town Incident is Entirely Intentional Obstruction by Both Jiang and U.S. Sides\n    Three Commissioners Reach Agreement on Anping Investigation Procedures\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 14th] (Delayed) Our agency’s special correspondent visited the spokesperson of the Beiping CCP Delegation on the morning of the 12th to inquire about the truth behind the failure of Special Group 25 to carry out its work smoothly after the Anping incident. The questions and answers are as follows: Question: When was Special Group 25 formed? Answer: After the Anping incident on July 29, the CCP immediately proposed to the U.S. side to send a group to investigate. The decision to send a group was made on August 1. Question: If the group was dispatched on the 1st, why did it not start working until the 5th? Answer: According to the practice of the Executive Headquarters, the group should be convened by the U.S. chairman. The U.S. representative of Group 25 did not notify until the 3rd, and a meeting was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on the 4th. However, when the meeting convened on the 4th, the U.S. representative Davis again refused to hold the meeting, citing being busy collecting materials. Question: When did the group start working? Answer: It started on the morning of the 5th. However, in the afternoon of that day, the government representative Wu Dingneng suddenly opposed the participation of the CCP representative, Major General Huang Yifeng, in the group due to the issue of representative qualifications, resulting in no results from that day’s meeting. Question: What was the progress of the work in the following days? Answer: On the 6th and 7th, due to the U.S. representative's attempt to force the group to listen solely to the reports of personnel designated by the U.S. side and refusal of the CCP representative's proposal to determine work procedures, the work was fruitless for several days. Question: Did the group go out for inspection? Answer: The three commissioners originally scheduled the group to depart on the morning of the 8th, but the U.S. representative suddenly wanted to limit the number of group members, saying that each group should not exceed three people. After the CCP representative refuted this with reason, Davis threatened by not providing vehicles, and at the same time insisted on checking the identity cards of the CCP members, which delayed the departure until 2:00 p.m. Question: What was the situation during the Anping inspection? Answer: The terrain of Anping is a flat plain, all open ground. An ambush during the day is absolutely impossible, and the so-called engineering obstacles are all fabricated. What can be proven is that the government army occupied the area after coordinating with the U.S. military in the attack on July 29. The situation in the area has changed, and the people are unable to freely express the actual military situation under the threat of the Kuomintang army. Question: Have you contacted the local CCP military headquarters? Answer: The government representative firmly opposed going to the CCP area, so it could not be achieved. The liaison officer designated by the CCP has not been able to depart until now because the government refused to guarantee safety. General Xiao Ke has again telegraphed the group to go, because the commander there has been waiting for nine days. Question: Why has the procedural issue become the focus of the dispute? Answer: The Kuomintang and the U.S. sides attempted to only allow the group to listen to reports from the U.S. Marine Corps and witnesses designated by the U.S. side, and were not prepared to investigate in the CCP area. They also used the excuse of not guaranteeing safety to prevent CCP personnel from coming to Beiping, and then have a \"judgment in absentia\" by the Jiang and U.S. sides, and publish a one-sided report. Therefore, they refused to have procedures, while the CCP believed that there must be procedures, and that the execution of procedures should be guaranteed in order to have the opportunity to explain the true facts. Question: Is it true that the CCP is delaying the investigation? Answer: Anping has now been occupied by the Kuomintang army, and the conflict in Xianghe is expanding day by day, while the Jiang and U.S. sides are making absurd propaganda, causing some people to be unclear about the truth. Therefore, our side is more eager than the Jiang and U.S. sides to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to get to the bottom of the matter.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Regarding the Anping group investigation procedures, the three commissioners of the Executive Headquarters reached the following agreement yesterday: (1) Questioning and recording the testimonies of U.S. witnesses Major Fretz and two others, who were personnel of the Executive Headquarters traveling in vehicles of a transportation convoy escorted by an armed patrol of the U.S. Marine Corps. (2) Questioning and recording the testimonies of U.S. Marine Corps Captain Belcher and U.S. Marine Corps personnel who participated in the conflict. (3) Visiting, questioning, and recording the testimonies of CCP military commanders and soldiers who participated in the conflict. (4) Inspecting the conflict area and visiting and recording the testimonies of other witnesses. (5) Questioning and recording the testimonies of Lieutenant General Locke, commander of the 1st Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps in Tianjin, General Sun Lianzhong, commander of the 11th War Zone, and senior CCP military commanders in the area where the incident occurred. (6) Questioning and recording the testimonies of other witnesses deemed necessary by each party to ascertain the truth of the incident. (7) Visiting, questioning, and recording whether the Kuomintang troops claimed by the CCP to have participated in the conflict are facts recognized by the government and the U.S. Marine Corps. (8) Convening group meetings to prepare a report to be submitted to the three commissioners. The chairman of the group meetings will be rotated among the three parties. It is further agreed that there should be no distinction between the various types of witnesses. Regardless of whether they were in the area during the conflict, witnesses are not notaries. Anyone who testifies before the group is a witness, and the reliability of all witness testimony is determined by the group. The group should execute this procedure in its entirety and cannot be changed without the unanimous agreement of the three commissioners, nor can its implementation be hindered by any excuse. This directive is signed by CCP representative Ye Jianying, government representative Zheng Jiemin, and U.S. representative Robertson.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北平中共代表团发言人答记者  安平镇事件调处受阻真象完全是蒋美双方故意留难  三委员获致安平调查程序协议\n\n1946-08-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北平中共代表团发言人答记者\n    安平镇事件调处受阻真象完全是蒋美双方故意留难\n    三委员获致安平调查程序协议\n    【新华社北平十四日电】（迟到）本社特派记者十二日晨访问北平中共代表团发言人，叩询安平事件发生后二十五特别小组未能顺利进行工作之真相。问答如次：问：二十五特别小组何时组成？答：于七月二十九日安平事件后，中共方面即向美方提议派小组调查，至八月一日始决定派遣小组。问：一日已派遣小组，何以五日才开始工作？答：照执行部向例，小组应由美方主席召集，二十五小组美方代表三日始通知，四日上午九时开会，但至四日开会时，美代表戴维斯又借口忙于搜集材料未允开会。问：小组何时开始工作？答：五日上午开始，惟该日下午政府代表吴定能突又以代表资格问题，反对中共代表黄逸峰少将参加小组，致该日会议毫无结果。问：以后数日工作进程如何？答：六、七两日，由于美代表企图强制小组单独听取美方指定人员之报告，拒绝中共代表确定工作程序的提议，致数日工作毫无成绩。问：小组出发视察否？答：三委员原定小组于八日上午出发，但临时美代表忽欲限制小组人数，谓每组不得超过三人，当中共代表据理驳斥后，戴维斯又以不供给车辆威胁，同时又坚持检查中共组员身份证，以致延至下午二时始出发。问：安平视察情形如何？答：安平地形一片平原，全系开阔地，白日打伏击绝不可能，且所称工事阻碍物等均属捏造，可证明者，为政府军于七月二十九日配合美军进攻后，即已占领该地，该地情势变动，民众受国民党军威胁不能自由表明军事实际真象。问：曾与当地中共军司令部联络否？答：政府代表坚决反对去中共地区，因之未能成行，中共派定之联络官亦因政府拒绝保证安全，至今未能出发，现萧克将军已再次电催小组前往，因该处指挥官已等待九日了。问：程序问题何以成为争执之焦点？答：国美双方企图仅让小组听取美海军陆战队及美方指定之证人的报告，不准备到中共地区调查，并以不保证安全，使中共人员不能来北平，而由蒋美双方来一个“缺席裁判”，将片面报告公布，因此他们就不肯要程序，而中共方面认为必须有程序，且应保证执行程序始能有说明真实事迹的机会。问：有人谓中共拖延调查确否？答：现安平已被国民党军占领，香河冲突又日形扩大，而蒋美双方作荒诞的宣传，致使若干人均不明真象，故我方要求彻查真象，以期水落石出，远较蒋美双方更为迫切。\n    【新华社北平十五日电】关于安平小组调查程序，执行部三委员于昨日已获致协议如下：（１）询问及记录美方证人傅瑞慈少校等二人之证言，此二人系执行部人员搭乘美陆战队武装巡逻队护送之运输队车辆者。（２）询问及记录美陆战队队长贝尔查中校及美陆战队参加冲突之人员。（３）访问、询问及记录参加冲突之中共军指挥官及士兵证言。（４）视察冲突之地区并访问及记录其他证人之证言。（５）询问及记录天津美陆战队第一师司令官骆基中将及十一战区长官孙连仲将军及事件发生地区中共军高级指挥官之证言。（６）询问及记录若干其他证言人证言，此等证人为每一方面所认为求得事件真象所必须征询者。（７）访问、询问及记录中共所称曾参加冲突而为政府及美陆战队方面所承认之国民党军队是否事实。（８）召集小组会议，准备向三委员提出报告，小组会议主席由三方面轮流担任。兹更协定各类证人之间不应有所差别，无论彼等在冲突期间是否在该地，证人并非公证人，凡在小组前作证之人即为证人，所有证人证言的可靠程度由小组决定之。由此程序小组应全部执行，非经三人委员一致同意不得变更，更不能得以任何借口阻碍其实行。本指令由中共代表叶剑英、政府代表郑介民、美代表饶伯森签字。"

More than two hundred Yan [Xishan] troops attacked our Zhengtai Team's Third Squad again. The troops quickly entered their positions, because no one believed that any \"agreements,\" \"accords,\" or \"ceasefire orders\" could restrain the Yan troops and the Japanese anymore.\n    The enemy quickly outflanked us from the left wing. Captain Cai pointed to the mountain top on the left with the signal flag pole, and said to Wu Baolin: \"Squad Leader Wu! Take men to seize this mountain top, run quickly! Hold the position, don't let the enemy come up.\"\n    Habit made him reply \"Yes!\"\n    The enemy's artillery and machine guns launched a fierce attack, obviously this was the main attack direction.\n    Under the bombardment of artillery and the roar of machine guns, five or six enemies began to charge, once, twice... they were all repelled. Then the enemy's reserves also joined in, heavy machine guns fired continuously, everyone was particularly nervous, some said: \"Watch this one!\" When they attacked the front line, Baolin commanded the whole squad to throw more than two hundred hand grenades, scattering the enemies in all directions, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.\n    The infantry retreated, and the artillery began to bombard us again. Where the shells landed, thick smoke rose up, and the dust sprinkled on the soldiers was patted off by everyone. The strong smell of gunpowder choked our noses, but we acted as if nothing had happened.\n    Unfortunately, a shell flew over and blew off both of Baolin's feet. Fresh blood gushed out, staining the blue stone red, and splashing all over his legs, but Comrade Baolin still did not leave the front line. He couldn't stand to throw grenades, so he crawled to the front of the fortifications and gritted his teeth to throw three more grenades. Finally, after Captain Cai's repeated persuasion, he left the fighting post of defending peace. The deputy platoon leader was very touched and personally escorted him for half a mile. Comrade Baolin raised his head from the stretcher and said: \"Deputy Platoon Leader! Go back! Tell the comrades: strive to defend peace, eliminate the enemies who destroy peace, don't mind me, I'm fine.\"\n    But when the stretcher reached Black Peak Village, he gloriously sacrificed himself due to severe injuries and excessive blood loss. The comrades who followed the stretcher brought the news of Comrade Baolin's sacrifice to the company. Immediately, the company's clamor and singing turned into silence, and from silence into anger. The instructor clenched his fists and said: \"We must defend peace! Avenge Comrade Baolin!\"\n    The comrades shouted together, \"Yes, wipe out the reactionaries and avenge Comrade Wu Baolin!\" (Liu Zhi).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 去打敌人，不要管我！  追念武保林同志\n刘志\n1946-08-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　去打敌人，不要管我！\n    追念武保林同志\n    二月廿五日，天阴霾的很，而且下着小雪。阎日军二百多人，又向我们正太队三分队进攻来了，部队很快进入阵地，因为谁也不再相信什么“协议”“协定”“停战命令”能约束住阎军和日本人。\n    敌人急急的从左翼迂回过来，蔡队长用联络旗杆指着左边山头，向武保林说：“六班长！带人抢占这个山头，快跑！坚持阵地，不让敌人上来”。\n    习惯使他答了声“是”！\n    敌人的炮机枪猛烈进攻起来，显然这是主攻方向了。\n    炮轰和机枪的怒吼下，五六个敌人开始冲锋，一次二次………都被打退了。接着敌人预备队也参加了，重机枪不停的连放，大家精神特别紧张，有的说：“看这一下吧！”攻到前沿时，保林指挥全班打了二百多个手榴弹，打的敌人东跑西窜，大家才松了口气。\n    步兵败回去了，炮兵又向我们轰起来，炮弹落处，浓烟突起，撒到战士身上的尘土，大家顺手拍一拍，强烈的硝烟味，窒息着我们的鼻子，我们若无其事。\n    不幸，一颗炮弹飞来，将保林的两脚炸没了，鲜血涌流，染红了青石，也溅满了两腿，但保林同志仍不下火线。他不能立着拚手榴弹，他爬到工事前沿，又咬着牙拚了三个手榴弹，最后经蔡连长再三劝说，他才脱离了保卫和平的战斗岗位。排副很受感动，亲自送他半里地。保林同志从担架上抬起头来说：“排副！你们回去吧！告同志们说：努力保卫和平，消灭破坏和平的敌人，不要管我，我不要紧。”\n    但，担架走到黑峰村，终因伤重流血过多，他光荣牺牲了。跟担架的同志，把保林同志牺牲了的消息带到连上，立刻全连的喧哗、歌唱变成了寂静，由寂静变成了愤怒，指导员捏紧拳头说：“我们要保卫和平！为保林同志复仇！”\n    同志们一齐高喊着“对，把反动派消灭干净，为武保林同志报仇！”（刘志）。"

Previous disputes on this issue have been resolved, and the procedural disputes of the committee have also reached an agreement, that is, based on the procedure drafted by the Secretary-General of the Peace Conference, the main points are: first, to review the preamble and political and territorial clauses; second, to review the issue of Allied troop withdrawal; third, to resolve differences; and fourth, to address all the provisions of the treaty. The chairman of the committee, South African representative Eglan, proposed that the draft treaty must be submitted for discussion before midnight on the 20th of this month. The draft treaty should be discussed chapter by chapter and article by article, and the Italian delegation should prepare complete memorandums according to the different articles of the treaty. All the above proposals were unanimously adopted.\n\nOn several subcommittees related to the Romanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Finnish issues, the Soviet representatives proposed that only countries that actually fought against the Axis satellite states should have the right to vote. Some countries disagreed with this, and no decision was made. Due to the lack of housing and translators, no more than three subcommittees can meet simultaneously each day. The committees will meet in the morning and afternoon, and also hold sessions in the evening. The plenary session will resume this morning, with representatives from Albania, Mexico, Cuba, and Egypt, who have recently been invited to participate, expressing their opinions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 和会进入小组活动  十个小组均已相继成立\n\n1946-08-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　和会进入小组活动\n    十个小组均已相继成立\n    【新华社延安十七日电】巴黎讯：巴黎和会已进入小组委员会活动的阶段，昨日竟日举行小组委员会，大会停开。十个小组委员会已相继成立：即意大利政治领土委员会、意大利经济及财政委员会、罗马尼亚政治领土委员会、保加利亚政治领土委员会、匈牙利政治领土委员会、芬兰政治领土委员会、罗保匈芬经济财政委员会、意罗保匈芬军事委员会、法律起草委员会以及一般问题委员会。各小组委员会日前的议程限于程序问题，意罗保匈芬军事委员会已选出波兰代表纳兹科夫斯基上校为主席，国民党政府代表傅秉常为副主席。罗保匈芬经济财政委员会亦选出捷代表科尔巴任主席，澳代表伊瓦特任副主席。提案说明人由苏联代表担任。一般问题委员会选出挪代表兰基任主席，波代表维尔布罗夫斯基任副主席。法律起草委员会由加代表克勒克斯敦任主席，白俄罗斯代表任副主席。荷兰代表佛兰索伊斯任提案说明人。最重要的一个小组委员会——意大利政治领土委员会，于昨日第二次集会，该委员会之提案说明人由新西兰代表担任，前此关于这一问题的争执，业已解决，该委员会之程序问题的争执，亦已达协议，即根据和会秘书长所草拟的程序，其要点为：第一审议序言及政治领土条款，第二审议盟国撤兵问题，第三解决分歧，第四条约的全部条款。该委员会主席南菲代表埃格兰提议对于条约草案，必须在本月廿日午夜之前提付讨论，条约草案应逐章逐条讨论，并请意大利代表团按条约的不同条文制订完全的备忘录。以上提议均经全体一致通过。在有关罗保匈芬问题的好几个小组委员会上，苏代表均提出只有实际与各该轴心附庸国作过战的国家才有表决权，有些国家对此不同意，遂未作决定。由于房屋与翻译人员之缺乏，各小组委员会每日同时开会者不能超过三个小组，委员会将于上下午开会，晚间亦举行。大会将于今日上午续开，由最近才被邀参加的阿尔巴尼亚、墨西哥、古巴、埃及四国代表发表意见。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 16th - The Northeast Provinces Representatives Joint Conference, which has epoch-making significance in Northeast history, solemnly opened in Harbin on the morning of the 7th of this month. The purpose of the conference is to further unite the forces of all classes and nationalities in the Northeast to build a democratic and prosperous new Northeast, strengthen ties between the provinces, and determine unified guidelines and plans to achieve local autonomy in the Northeast. At the preparatory meeting held on the 6th, Zhang Xuesi, Chairman of Liaoning Province, reported on the significance of the conference and the preparations made on behalf of the conference organizing committee. He pointed out that when the Japanese surrendered last year and the Northeast people were liberated by the Democratic Allied Forces and the Soviet Red Army, people's representatives from all over the Northeast had convened a meeting in Shenyang to discuss plans for building a new Northeast, but the meeting had to be temporarily adjourned due to the Kuomintang's frenzied offensive. At that time, Lin Feng, Lü Zhengcao, Zhang Xuesi, and others were elected to the presidium to prepare for the reopening of the meeting. Chairman Zhang Xuesi explained that over the past year, the people of the Northeast have effectively fought against the military offensives of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the people of each province have successively elected their own governments and people's congresses, and formulated their own policy programs and guidelines according to their own will. Now, in order to strengthen the ties between the democratic regimes of the provinces and unify the democratic construction of the Northeast, the significance of this conference is very significant. The conference officially opened on the morning of the 7th. One hundred and eighty-six representatives from all over the Northeast, including seven Kuomintang members, seven members of the Northeast National Salvation General Association, one member of the Democratic League, three members of the Democratic Political Association, one member of the Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, one member of the Anti-Imperialist League, two League members, fifty-four Communist Party members, representing various nationalities including Han, Mongolian, Hui, and Korean, from former officials and current democratic government staff to all sectors of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers. After the meeting opened, Gao Chongmin, head of the Northeast General Branch of the Democratic League and Chairman of Andong Province, delivered an opening speech, explaining that the convocation of the conference was due to the fact that the people of the Northeast had seen through the true face of the Kuomintang reactionaries, recognized the benefits of democracy for them, and urgently needed democratic autonomy. He asked the conference to seriously study how to improve the democratic regime and establish policy guidelines, to transform governments at all levels from top to bottom and from bottom to top, so that today's democratic construction could be more extensive and in-depth. General Zhou Baozhong, one of the leaders of the Northeast Anti-Japanese resistance, spoke about the tasks of the Northeast people from the history of the Northeast people's fourteen-year struggle to the current task. The conference inherited the speech of Comrade Peng Zhen, representative of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CPC and the headquarters of the Democratic Allied Forces. Comrade Peng Zhen called on the conference to strive for independence, peace, and democracy in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Chinese people's nation-building. Following this, Mr. Chen Xianzhou, head of the Northeast Democratic Political Association and Speaker of the Andong Provincial Assembly, Mr. Xie Yuqin, President of the Harbin China-Soviet Friendship Association, and representatives of workers, peasants, women, troops, and Mongolian and Hui minorities spoke. In their speeches, the representatives unanimously expressed their determination to unite around the conference and strive to eliminate the reactionary offensives and defend and build a democratic new Northeast.\nXinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th - At the Northeast Provinces Representatives Joint Conference, all the representatives unanimously passed the establishment of the \"Joint Administrative Office of Northeast Provinces and Municipalities (Special Municipalities),\" which is the highest organ for promoting democratic construction in the Northeast provinces and unifying the administration of the Northeast provinces. The conference also elected Lin Feng, Lü Zhengcao, Zhang Xuesi, Zhou Baozhong, Che Xiangchen, Zou Dapeng, Feng Zhongyun, Wan Yi, Yan Baohang, Gao Chongmin, Li Youwen, Liu Lanbo, Tang Hongjing, Yu Yifu, Chen Xianzhou, Li Du, Li Yanlu, Guan Junyan, Jin Guangxia, Ning Wu, Han Youtong, Zhou Jingwen, Tang Feng'a, Tang Shouga, Zhu Qiwen, Song Shende, Temuer Bagen, and seventeen others as administrative committee members of the office, including Communist Party members, Kuomintang members, Democratic League figures, Northeast elders, representatives of the Anti-Japanese United Army and the Democratic Allied Forces, Mongolian and Korean national representatives who had contributed to the Anti-Japanese War, and Northeast democratic figures from within the customs. Before the election, the conference conducted a careful discussion on the organizational outline of the office and the election method of the administrative committee members. First, Mr. Lin Feng explained the organizational outline in detail on behalf of the presidium, pointing out that the draft election plan of the outline stipulated that the election of the administrative committee members would be carried out by first electing candidates from each delegation, and then conducting a secret ballot at the conference, first going through a preliminary election, and then conducting a formal election, and the election could not be restricted by the list of candidates. This point also fully demonstrated the democratic spirit of this conference. Mr. Lin Feng also explained the relationship between the joint office and the provinces and cities, which is a direct superior-subordinate relationship. The office will set up nine committees according to actual needs, and the term of office of each committee member is one year. Comrade Lin Feng stressed: This organization was established in accordance with the will of all the people in the Northeast. After the liberation of the Northeast, our Northeast people expected the establishment of a local joint government in the Northeast, but the Kuomintang reactionaries not only failed to meet our requirements, but also mobilized large armies to launch a civil war in the Northeast, attempting to eliminate the democratic regime of the Northeast people. We named this a joint office this time, which also shows that this is a transitional and temporary institution, which means that we still expect the establishment of a democratic joint government with local autonomy. Following this, representatives spoke, and the Mongolian and Korean representatives proposed adding a minority ethnic committee under the joint office to deal with minority ethnic issues. After discussion, it was adopted. The issue of the power to interpret the organizational outline and other clauses was also seriously discussed, revised, or supplemented by the conference. At this point, the organizational outline was adopted.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 团结各阶层各民族实现地方自治  东北各省代表联席会揭幕  决议建立“各省市行政联合办事处”，统一东北行政，并选出林枫等十七人为行政委员。\n\n1946-08-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　团结各阶层各民族实现地方自治\n    东北各省代表联席会揭幕     \n    决议建立“各省市行政联合办事处”，统一东北行政，并选出林枫等十七人为行政委员。\n    【新华社哈尔滨十六日电】在东北历史上具有划时代意义的东北各省代表联席会，已于本月七日上午在哈市隆重揭幕举行。该会的目的，在于进一步团结东北各阶层各民族力量建设民主的繁荣的新东北，并加强各省联系，确定统一的方针与计划，以实现东北的地方自治。在六日举行的预备会议上，辽宁省主席张学思代表大会筹委会报告会议意义及筹备经过，指出当去年日本投降，东北人民为民主联军及苏联红军解放后，东北各地人民代表曾在沈阳召开会议商讨建设新东北的大计，但旋因国民党的疯狂进攻，该会不得不暂告休会。当时并选出林枫、吕正操、张学思等七人为主席团，筹备重开会议。张学思主席说明一年来东北人民一方面有效的打击了国民党反动派的军事进攻，一方面各省人民皆先后选举了自己的政府和民意机关，并按照人民自己的意志制订了施政纲领与方针。今为加强各省民主政权的联系，统一东北民主建设事，故此次会议之意义非常重大。七日上午大会正式揭幕。一百八十六位来自东北各地的代表，包括国民党员七人，东北救亡总会七人，民主同盟一人，民主政治协会三人，东北抗日救国会一人，反帝大同盟一人，同盟会员二人，共产党员五十四人，代表中包括汉、蒙、回、韩各民族，从旧官吏现任民主政府工作人员，到工农商学兵各界。开会后，首由民主同盟东北总支部负责人安东省主席高崇民先生致开会词，说明大会之召集系由于东北人民已看清了国民党反动派的真面目，认识了民主对他们的好处，急切需要民主自治。他要求大会，要认真研究怎样才能健全民主政权确立施政方针，自上而下的，自下而上的改造各级政权，使今天的民主建设更加广泛和深入。东北抗日领袖之一周保中将军，从东北人民十四年斗争历史谈到当前东北人民的任务。大会继承中共东北中央局及民主联军总部代表彭真同志讲话。彭真同志号召大会要本着中国人民建国的根本方针，为实现独立、和平、民主而奋斗。继起讲话者，有东北民主政治协会负责人安东省议长陈先舟先生、哈市中苏友好协会会长谢雨琴先生及工、农、妇女、部队与蒙回少数民族代表。各代表讲话中，皆一致表示定要团结在大会周围，为消灭反动派进攻，保卫与建设民主的新东北而奋斗。\n    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】东北各省代表联席会上，全体代表一致通过成立“东北各省市（特别市）行政联合办事处”，此乃推进东北各省民主建设、统一东北各省行政的最高机关。大会并根据办事处组织大纲中之选举法选出林枫、吕正操、张学思、周保中、车向忱、邹大鹏、冯仲云、万毅、阎宝航、高崇民、栗又文、刘澜波、唐洪敬、于毅夫、陈先舟、李杜、李延禄、关俊彦、金光侠、宁武、韩幽桐、周鲸文、唐丰阿、唐寿轧、朱其文、宋慎德、特穆尔巴根等十七人为该办事处之行政委员，其中包括共产党员、国民党员、民主同盟人士、东北耆老、抗联与民主联军、抗日有功之蒙、韩民族代表及关内东北民主人士。大会在选举之前，曾对该办事处之组织大纲与行政委员选举办法进行慎重讨论，首由林枫氏代表主席团对组织大纲详细说明，指出大纲之选举草案中规定行政委员之选举，系采取先由各代表团推选候选人，再在大会进行无记名投票，先经过预选，再进行正式选举，且选举时可以不受候选名单的限制。此点亦充分显示此次大会的民主精神。林枫氏并说明此联合办事处和各省市的关系，乃是直接的上级关系，办事处下根据实际需要设九个委员会，各委员之任期为一年。林枫同志力称：这个组织乃是遵照全东北人民的意志成立的，在东北解放后，我们东北人民即期望成立一东北地方性的联合政府，但国民党反动派非但不能满足我们的这种要求，反而调动大军在东北发动内战，企图将东北人民的民主政权消灭。我们这次取名联合办事处，亦表明这是一个过渡时期临时性质的机构，这就是说我们还期待地方自治的民主的联合政府的成立。继由各代表发言，蒙、韩代表提议联合办事处下增设一少数民族委员会，以处理少数民族问题。经讨论后获得通过。关于对组织大纲的解释权问题及其他条文，亦经大会认真讨论修正或补充。至此组织大纲乃获得通过。"

    "content": "The Kuomintang's One-Party Diplomats Cannot Represent China\nLiberation Daily Editorial, August 17th\n\nOn the eve of the Paris Peace Conference, CPC representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu proposed that the Chinese delegation attending the conference should include representatives from the CPC, other democratic parties, and non-affiliated individuals. After the conference opened, the CPC repeatedly urged the Kuomintang government to accept this request. The CPC and the Chinese people are well aware that due to the Kuomintang government's reliance on foreign forces to maintain its dictatorship by force, a large-scale civil war is taking place within China. However, in order to maintain our national status and honor, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people believe that China should have a unified delegation attending the Paris Peace Conference and other international conferences. Precisely because China is the only country attending the conference that is undergoing a large-scale civil war, and the Chinese government is recognized by all countries as a Kuomintang one-party dictatorship that must be democratized but has not yet been democratized, the Chinese delegation cannot be simply appointed by the government like other countries, but must include representatives from various parties, especially representatives from the Liberated Areas, which account for one-third of the country's population. However, the Kuomintang government has always only cared about the monopoly interests of a few ruling groups, disregarding the country's status and honor. Therefore, it has consistently rejected the CPC's demand to represent the public opinion of all the Chinese people.\n\nThe result of the Chiang Kai-shek government's representatives attending international conferences alone is only to damage China's national honor and lower China's international status. There are too many such examples: following Qin Dechun's incompetent and disgraceful performance in being humiliated by war criminals at the Far East Tribunal, Zhu Shuming made a fool of himself again at the Allied Council for Japan's special meeting on the 13th. The US representative Acheson proposed expanding the committee, which aimed to lower China's and the Soviet Union's position in the control of Japan, so that the United States could better manipulate the committee, and MacArthur's policy of stubbornly supporting the revival of Japanese aggression could be carried out more smoothly. This is particularly dangerous for the new China. The Kuomintang government's representative, Zhu Shuming, was unable to stand on the position of China's national interests and solemnly oppose the US demands, and put forward the proposition of equal cooperation among the four powers in order to effectively control Japan and ban Japanese aggression. When the US representative urged him to express his attitude, he only hesitated and shrank back, simply saying \"hehe.\" At the Paris Peace Conference, the facts of the past nineteen days have also proved that the Kuomintang government's representatives have not adopted an independent, autonomous position that conforms to the status of one of the four powers, is conducive to China's honor, and is beneficial to world peace, but instead follow the lead of the United States. Such representatives naturally do not arouse respect from any party in the conference. The main task of the Paris Peace Conference is to discuss the signing of treaties with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, and Italy, which were previously Axis countries and have now been democratized. The representatives of the Kuomintang government participated in this conference, but the Kuomintang government itself has torn up the Political Consultative Conference resolutions that would \"democratize the country,\" frantically intensifying its fascistization, and is not much different from the former dictatorial governments of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, and Italy. Moreover, this fascist Chiang Kai-shek government, with the assistance of the US government, is carrying out an unprecedented massacre of the Chinese people – civil war and fascist terror – thereby threatening peace in the Far East and the world. No wonder Wang Shijie's speech at the conference at the end of last month aroused ridicule from all sides: \"Carrying out a fascist policy yourself, and still talking about the democracy of defeated countries! Fighting a civil war yourself, and still talking about world peace!\" How can these ruthless facts not pain every patriotic compatriot!\n\nThe Chinese people, especially the people of the Liberated Areas, have made great contributions to the victory of the world's anti-fascist war with their own bloodshed, sacrifice, and arduous struggle. We cannot tolerate the Kuomintang authorities constantly tarnishing China's national honor and lowering China's international status in the name of a \"legitimate\" government.\n\nIn terms of the world situation, today the Chinese people's heroic struggle for self-defense against interference, for independence; against civil war, for peace; and against dictatorship, for democracy, is an important part of the world's cause of peace. If China does not have independence, peace, and democracy, and if the world's cause of peace does not have the active participation of China's 450 million people, then the establishment and consolidation of the world's post-war peaceful and democratic order is also unimaginable. Therefore, in various international conferences and international organizations, it is clear that the strange phenomenon of only personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, which is waging a civil war, attending as representatives of China, while the true representatives of the vast Chinese people are excluded from the conferences, is neither in the interests of the Chinese people nor in the interests of the world's cause of peace and democracy. The Chinese people have the right and the responsibility to demand that the conference take into account the will of the Chinese people and correct this strange phenomenon.\n\nFor the sake of China's own honor and the interests of the world's cause of peace, the Chinese delegation attending the Paris Peace Conference, UN meetings, the committee controlling Japan, and other international conferences and institutions must include representatives from the CPC, other democratic parties, and non-affiliated individuals. This is a minimum demand of the Chinese people. We insist on fighting for this demand, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal. If the Kuomintang authorities continue to unreasonably reject this demand, then the Chinese people will refuse to recognize the representativeness and validity of the representatives sent by the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government to any international conference, and reserve their own right to speak.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党一党的外交官不能代表中国  解放日报十七日社论\n\n1946-08-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党一党的外交官不能代表中国\n    解放日报十七日社论\n    在巴黎和会开会的前夕，中共代表周恩来、董必武二氏即提出了出席和会的中国代表团，应当包括中共和其他民主党派与无党无派的代表的要求，和会开幕以后，中共复再三敦促国民党政府接受这一个要求。中共和中国人民明明知道：由于国民党政府依仗外力以武力维持独裁，中国内部正存在着大规模的内战，然而为了保持我们的国家地位荣誉，中国共产党和中国人民认为中国应当有举国一致的代表团出席巴黎和会和其他国际会议。正因为中国是出席和会的唯一发展着大规模内战的国家，中国政府是被世界各国公认为必须民主化而至今尚未民主化的国民党一党专政的政府，中国代表团就决不能像其他国家一样的简单由政府指派，而必须有各党派代表参加，特别是要有占全国人口三分之一的解放区代表参加。可是，国民党政府是素来只知道少数统治集团的垄断利益而不顾国家的地位荣誉的，因此它始终拒绝中共所提出的代表全中国人民公意的要求。\n    由蒋介石政府的代表独自出席国际会议，其结果只是毁损中国的国家荣誉，降低中国的国际地位。关于这类的事例实在是太多了：继秦德纯在远东法庭被战犯污辱表现昏庸无能的事件之后，朱世明又在盟国对日委员会十三日特别会议上大出其丑。美代表艾契森在会议中提出扩大委员会的要求，这一要求之目的，在于降低中国与英苏在对日管制中的地位，使美国更能操纵该委员会，以便麦克阿瑟一意孤行，扶植日本侵略势力复活的政策更加畅行无阻。这对新中国是特别危险的，国民党政府的代表朱世明，竟不能站在中国民族利益的立场上，严正的反对美方的要求，和提出四大国平等合作以期有效地管制日本禁绝日本侵略势力的主张。当美代表促他表示态度时，他只是踌躇畏缩，徒呼呵呵。在巴黎和会上，十九天以来的事实，也证明国民党政府的代表并没有采取独立自主的、符合于四强之一的地位的、有助于中国的荣誉、有利于世界和平的立场，而且仰承美国的鼻息。这样的代表，自然引不起和会中任何方面的尊敬。巴黎和会的主要任务，是讨论以前属于轴心，而现已民主化的匈、罗、保、芬、意等国家签订和约。国民党政府的代表参加这一和会，可是国民党政府本身却已撕毁了使“国家民主化”的政协决议，疯狂的加紧法西斯化，和以前的匈、罗、保、芬、意的独裁政府没有多大区别。不仅如此，这个法西斯化的蒋介石政府，正在凭借美国政府的援助，向中国人民进行空前的大屠杀——内战与法西斯恐怖手段，因而威胁了远东和世界的和平。无怪上月底王世杰在和会演讲后，引起了各方面的嘲笑：“自己实行着法西斯化的政策，还谈什么战败国的民主！自己打着内战，还谈什么世界和平！”这些无情的事实，怎能不叫每一个有爱国心的同胞为之痛心！\n    中国人民，特别是解放区人民，以自己的流血牺牲和艰苦战斗，对世界反法西斯战争的胜利作了伟大的贡献，我们不能容忍国民党当局借“合法”政府之名，不断的污损中国的国家荣誉，降低中国的国际地位。\n    就世界局势而言，今天中国人民反对干涉，争取独立；反对内战，争取和平；反对独裁，争取民主的英勇自卫斗争，正是全世界和平事业的重要部分。如果中国没有独立和平与民主，如果世界和平事业没有得到中国四万万五千万人民的积极参加，那么世界战后和平民主秩序的建立和巩固，也是不可想像的。因此，在各种国际会议和国际机构中，只有进行内战的蒋介石独裁政府的人员作为中国的代表出席，而中国广大人民的真正代表反被摒于会议之外，这种怪现象显然是既不符合中国人民的利益，也不符合世界和平民主事业的利益。中国人民有权利，也有责任来要求和会照顾中国人民的意旨，纠正这种怪现象。\n    为中国本身的荣誉计，为了世界和平事业的利益计，出席巴黎和会、联合国会议、管制日本的委员会及其他国际会议和机构的中国代表团，必须有中共和其他民主党派与无党无派代表参加，这是中国人民的一个最低限度的要求。我们坚持为这个要求而奋斗，不达目的，誓不中止。如果国民党当局继续对这一要求加以无理拒绝，那末中国人民将拒绝承认蒋介石独裁政府派遣代表出席任何国际会议的代表性与有效性，并保留自己的发言权。"

Masses, militia, and honorary soldiers from counties such as Peixian, Jinxiang, Yutai, Peitong, and Fengle have successively gone to the front lines to defend themselves with arms. Shao Miao, the director of the peasant association and village head of Jinxiang, said indignantly at a village cadre meeting: \"If Chiang's army wants to fight a civil war, I will use this gun to fight him to the death.\" Fang Chongyou, an honorary soldier from Fangzhuang Village in Yutai County, was wounded last October in the self-defense battle against the Chiang army's attack on the liberated areas and returned to his hometown after being demobilized. Now, seeing the Chiang army relying on American aid to launch a large-scale attack on the liberated areas, he is extremely angry and has once again shouldered the rifle that accompanied him in the fight against the enemy for eight years, to go to the front lines again. In Peixian County, village cadres took the initiative to join the army last month, and recently, a conscription movement has been launched. Within five days, 320 young men from the county, armed with guns, rushed to the front lines, determined to resist the Chiang army's offensive.\n    [Another Dispatch] The workers in the border area are supporting the front lines with high production enthusiasm. Wang Chuangao, a worker in a bomb factory, had already asked for leave to go home and marry his wife. Hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was determined to expand the civil war, he tore up his leave slip, saying: \"I will go home and marry my wife after Chiang Kai-shek's invading army is driven away.\" The workers have automatically organized a competition. The output of bombs from the bomb factory has broken past records for many years. Each person averages more than 20 bombs per day. The workers proposed \"Make a few more molds and kill a few more reactionaries.\" In the past, each sand-turning worker cast more than a dozen molds per day, but now it has increased fourteen-fold. One worker cast 1,400 molds in one breath, creating the highest record. The number of sawed targets has also increased from 2,000 to more than 6,000, with the most exceeding 8,000. Pharmaceutical workers also automatically requested to increase working hours, and 200,000 packages of Renzhou have already been manufactured. The masses and militia stationed in the factory area have proposed to protect the factory and strictly prevent special agents from sabotage. Clothing and shoe factories have completed more than 100,000 sets of clothes and shoes for the troops. The wave of rear support for the front lines has excited all the soldiers on the front lines. Their unanimous response is: We will definitely smash the reactionaries' offensive.\n    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 16th Dispatch] News of the great victory of our army's counter-offensive on the Longhai Front has spread, and a wave of army support has been set off in Heze City. On August 14th, in just half a day, the people automatically donated 2 million yuan (equivalent to 10 million legal currency). Mr. Mao Boxuan, manager of Jiaotong Pai Cigarette Factory, donated 100,000 yuan. An eighty-year-old white-haired old woman on Huoshenmiao Street, upon hearing that the Eighth Route Army had won a victory, took 2,000 yuan early in the morning, leaning on her crutches, to see the local garrison, saying: \"You are shedding blood for the common people. I am donating some money. Comrades, please don't laugh at me.\" Workers in various factories have donated several hundred yuan of their daily wages. Fang Anbang, a young apprentice from Sanma Pai Cigarette Factory, eagerly donated one month's salary of 1,000 yuan. More than 40 representatives from the Heze Municipal Government, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Commercial Federation, Women's Federation, Student Federation, Children's Corps, etc., entrusted by the people, formed a comfort team, carrying dozens of cartloads of pigs, sheep, watermelons, grapes, cigarettes, towels, socks, and other gifts, and rushed to the battlefield on the 14th to comfort the patriotic soldiers on the front lines.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 支援陇海线反攻胜利  冀鲁豫人民踊跃上战场  炸弹厂工人展开多造炸弹竞赛慰问前线荷市半天捐款二百万\n\n1946-08-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　支援陇海线反攻胜利\n    冀鲁豫人民踊跃上战场\n    炸弹厂工人展开多造炸弹竞赛慰问前线荷市半天捐款二百万\n    【本报荷泽十四日电】陇海沿线人民，对国民党反动派发动大规模内战极为愤怒，沛县、金乡、鱼台、沛铜、丰乐等县群众、民兵及荣誉军人，纷纷走上前线武装自卫。金乡邵庙农会主任村长在村干会上愤慨的说：“老蒋的军队要打内战，我就拿这一根枪誓死和他拚”。鱼台县房庄荣誉军人房重友，他是去年十月间在反对蒋军进攻解放区的自卫战中负伤后复员返乡的，现在看到蒋军依仗美国援助大规模向解放区进攻，激怒万分，重新背上伴随自己抗敌八年的步枪，再上前线。沛县上月就有村干部自动参军，近更掀起了参军运动，五天内全县有三百二十个壮年，持枪投奔前线，决心反抗蒋军的进攻。\n    【又电】边区工人们，正以高度生产热情，支援前线。炸弹厂工人王传高，原已请假回家娶妻，听说蒋介石决心扩大内战，就把假条撕了，他说：“等打走了蒋介石的进犯军再回家娶老婆。”工人自动组织了竞赛运动。炸弹厂所出炸弹打破过去多年纪录，每人每天平均超出二十个，工人们提出“多做几个模子，多打死几个反动派。”翻沙工人过去每人每天铸十多个模子，现已增加十四倍，有一个工人一口气铸了一千四百个模子，创造了最高纪录。锯靶子亦由二千个增加到六千多个，最多的已超过八千。制药工人亦自动要求增加工作时间，单制造仁舟已达二十万包，工厂驻地群众民兵，则提出保卫工厂严防特务破坏。被服鞋工厂给部队做衣服鞋袜已完成十余万套。后方支援前线的浪潮兴奋了前线所有的战士，他们一致的回答是：我们一定把反动派的进攻粉碎。\n    【本报荷泽十六日电】陇海前线我军反攻大捷，消息传来，荷泽全市掀起劳军热潮。八月十四日仅半天人民自动捐款二百万元（合法币一千万元），交通牌卷烟厂经理毛伯轩先生捐十万元。火神庙街一位八十岁的白发老太婆她听到八路军打了胜仗，一早拿着二千元，扶着拐杖去见当地驻军说：“你们为老百姓流血，俺捐些钱，同志不要见笑。”各工厂工人纷纷献出一日几百元的工资。三马牌烟厂的小学徒方安邦争着捐出一个月的工资一千元。荷泽市政府、市工联、商联、妇联、学联、儿童团等代表四十余人，接受人民委托，组成慰劳队，携带几十辆大车的猪羊、西瓜、葡萄、香烟、毛巾、袜子等礼物，于十四日赶往战场慰劳前线的爱国战士。"

On the 12th of this month, the areas of Nanqiao and Xitatidi in Yongnian suffered two bombings and strafings. The Kuomintang dispatched as many as ten airplanes. The next morning, five Chiang planes flew again to bomb and strafe repeatedly the areas of Jiadi, Qiuquan, and Yancun outside Yongnian city, killing three residents. In the afternoon, Chiang's planes came in two batches, one of five and one of three. On the 14th and 15th, thirteen Chiang planes bombed the Nanqiao and Yancun areas again, causing extremely heavy losses to the residents. A young child in Hantun was also killed in the bombing. This bombing occurred while the Yongnian group of the Beiping Executive Headquarters was convening representatives of the three parties in Ping to discuss the Yongnian issue. The Kuomintang, relying on American planes, brazenly bombed peaceful residents, which has aroused extreme indignation among the people of Yongnian.

In these primaries, due to the active efforts of labor groups and progressive democratic groups, many reactionaries were defeated. According to received news, it is known that Robert M. La Follette Jr., a well-known isolationist for 21 years as a senator, Burton K. Wheeler of Montana (unlike Vandenberg and La Follette, he represented agricultural states that advocated non-intervention in other countries' affairs), and Henrik Shipstead of Minnesota, an anti-New Deal figure, have all been defeated. The North Dakota Farmers Union also cooperated with Democratic progressives to defeat the notorious isolationist Gerald Nye, who was trying to make a comeback (they also defeated him in 1944). The prominent progressive Congressman Jerry Voorhis has been successfully elected. The more progressive Axle Steele, and Lindsay (Governor from 1941-1945), a friend of the famous progressive Senator Claude Pepper, have also won in Maryland and Florida, respectively. The New Deal Senator from New York State, who is considered relatively progressive by the Republican Party, was urged by the reactionary state chairman Curran within the party to withdraw from political life, but he firmly refused. He was elected from the 17th district, receiving 77,000 votes, while the Republican Party in that district only had over 29,000. In this US Congressional election, 35 senators are up for re-election, including 22 Democrats and 13 Republicans. According to the Constitution, one-third, or 32 senators, should be re-elected every two years. However, because Stanleyfield of Kentucky, Young of North Dakota, and Gossett of Idaho were all senators elected in by-elections last year, a total of 35 senators must be re-elected. 36 governorships are up for re-election, including 17 Democrats and 19 Republicans. Among the governors continuing in office, there are 8 Democrats and 4 Republicans. As for members of the House of Representatives, all are up for re-election. Although only the primaries have been held so far, they have already shown that the American people are increasingly awakening, abandoning the reactionary members of Congress elected a few years ago who have now proven unable to represent them.\n    Currently, the primaries are mostly over, and there will be a fierce struggle in the official elections in November.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国会预选次第结束  反动分子不少落选  显示美国人民正日益觉悟\n\n1946-08-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国会预选次第结束\n    反动分子不少落选\n    显示美国人民正日益觉悟\n    【新华社延安十七日电】综合报导：对美国今后数年内政外交有巨大影响的国会及州长之预选，除四州外（即科罗拉多、路易斯安那、密芝根及内华达），其余各州均次第举行完毕。在此次预选中，由于劳工团体及进步民主团体之积极活动，反动分子不少落选。据所收到的消息，已知历任参议员二十一年的战前著名的孤立主义者拉福莱特、蒙大拿州之孤立主义者惠勒（他与范登堡及拉福莱特不同，是主张不问他国事件的农业州区的代表人物）、明尼苏达的反新政分子希普斯德等均已落选。北达科他州的农民联盟亦与民主党进步分子合作，以打败卷土重来之著名孤立主义者奈埃（他在一九四四年亦被他们击败而落选），著名之进步众议员德拉西已胜利当选，较进步之阿克斯迭尔及著名进步参议员泼贝尔之友林赛（一九四一——四五年州长）亦分别在密兰里与佛罗里达获胜。纽约州共和党较称进步的新政参议员，虽为党内的反动的州主席库兰所不满，嘱其退出政治生活，但他坚决拒绝，他是第十七选区选出的，得票七万七千，而该区共和党仅二万九千余。此次美国国会改选参议员三十五人，其中民主党二十二人，共和党十三人。按宪法规定，参议员每二年原应改选三分之一即三十二人，但因坎塔基州之斯丹菲尔、北达科他州之杨格、伊达荷州之哥塞特均系在去年补选之参议员，故共须改选三十五人。州长改选者三十六人，其中民主党十七人，共和党十九人，继续任职之州长中，民主党八人，共和党四人。至众院议员则全部改选，迄今所举行者虽仅为预选，但已显示美国人民正日益觉悟，摒弃在数年前选出的现已证明不能代表他们的反动议员。\n    目前预选大部结束，在十一月的正式大选中，尚有一番剧烈的斗争。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 17th—The Kuomintang reactionaries' insatiable aggression has enraged the millions of people in the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas, who have risen up to defend themselves. The movement to organize logistics to support the front lines and directly participate in the war and join the army has been widely launched in various places. In the Xuanjiabao self-defense battle in Taixing, central Jiangsu, more than 100,000 people participated in logistics and assistance. In Shuyang County, Huaihai District, more than 20,000 people have flocked into the logistics teams, and more than 1,400 young militia model teams have joined the war participation group. People in various places have been requesting to join the army. According to incomplete statistics from the fifth, sixth, and seventh sub-districts alone, more than 14,600 people have voluntarily requested to join the army. Wang Fengshan, the artillery hero of Lianshui, who was famous for leading the artillery team during the War of Resistance Against Japan, returned to his hometown to lead production after the ceasefire order was issued in January this year. This time, he could not bear the aggression of the reactionaries, so he had to put down his hoe and reorganize his old troops. They are repairing cannons and rushing to make landmines. Wang said: \"If the reactionaries dare to step into the area we snatched back from the enemy and puppets with our blood and flesh, my cannons and landmines will explode above and below their feet.\" Huang Aiyu, an old militia member from Sheyang, said: \"I have been a militia member for several years, and I am tired of carrying the Type 38 rifle. This time, the Chiang Kai-shek army is attacking, and I will seize an American gun from him to carry.\" Young women also actively participated in the militia. In Lianshui East County, nearly 2,000 women militia members have been developed in half a month. The people's armed forces have achieved great glorious results in the self-defense war. In addition to those previously reported, the militia in Jianan Township, Rugao, captured a total of 1,130 Chiang soldiers, and seized four war horses and two radio stations. Zhang Wanhe, the village chief of Shangling Village in the township, captured eight prisoners with his bare hands and seized a radio station. Wang, the village chief of Wangming Village in Rugao, seized two rifles with his bare hands in Dingyan (one of which was a \"carbine\"). On the way back, he found a Chiang soldier lying in a small ditch. Village Chief Wang shouted, \"Dare to move! I'll kill you!\" The Chiang soldier immediately handed over a light machine gun. A militia captain from a certain township in Zhangxu District, Tongxu County, led ten people to attack the Chiang army that invaded Lanshan on the Haizheng Highway on the fifth of this month. Taking advantage of the Chiang army's sleeping, they first moved away a machine gun. When the Chiang army was awakened and fled in panic, they killed ten and captured three, and seized more than ten rifles. The militia of Sanzhao Township, Sinan County, recovered three salt boats robbed by the Chiang army and killed or wounded three Chiang soldiers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Linyi, 17th—In the areas occupied by the Chiang army, the militia in various parts of Shandong widely launched sparrow warfare, blasting warfare, and landmine warfare, giving the invading army a strong blow. The militia in Jiaoxian and Jimo counties, in coordination with a small number of main forces, have been blocking two regiments of the 54th Army of the Chiang army that invaded the border area between the two counties for the past month. More than 100 landmines were laid on the Chiang army's invasion route, all of which exploded, killing or wounding 70 Chiang soldiers. In battles in various places, a total of more than 260 rifles, more than 1,200 pistol bullets, four small cannons, and three machine guns were seized. On the 30th of last month, the militia in Lincheng, southern Shandong, ambushed the Chiang army that invaded eastward from the city, luring them into a minefield. With a loud bang, 22 Chiang soldiers, including the company commander, were immediately killed. The militia in the Badou District of Boshan County, central Shandong, have been harassing more than 100 Chiang soldiers for days. In a surprise attack, they injured one Chiang army company commander and several soldiers. The Chiang army was enraged and launched a retaliatory attack. The militia used magical sparrow warfare to deal with them. The Chiang army searched everywhere in vain, and returned exhausted and frustrated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖人民奋起自卫  淮海万四千人自动参军  如皋驾南乡民兵俘蒋军千余山东各地民兵广泛开展麻雀战\n\n1946-08-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖人民奋起自卫\n    淮海万四千人自动参军\n    如皋驾南乡民兵俘蒋军千余山东各地民兵广泛开展麻雀战\n    【新华社淮阴十七日电】国民党反动派贪婪无已的进犯，激怒了苏皖解放区千百万人民奋起自卫，组织后勤支援前线以及直接参战参军运动，已在各地广泛展开。苏中泰兴宣家堡自卫战役中，参加后勤与助战群众即在十万以上。淮海区沭阳一县已有二万余群众涌入后勤队，一千四百余名青年民兵模范队加入参战团。各地群众更纷纷请求参军，仅据五、六、七三个分区不完全统计：自动请求参军群众达一万四千六百余名。在抗日战争中以领导大炮队著名的涟水炮兵英雄王凤山，今年一月停战令颁布后，曾解甲归田，领导生产，这次反动派进犯，他看得不能忍耐了，又只得放下锄头重整旧部，他们正在修整大炮，赶制地雷。王说：“反动派敢踏进我们用血肉从敌伪手中夺回的地区，我的大炮地雷就会在他们的头上脚下爆炸”。射阳老民兵黄爱瑜说：“我当了几年民兵，三八式枪扛厌了，这回蒋介石军队打来，我要缴他一根美国枪扛一扛”。女青年也纷纷参加民兵，涟东县在半个月内就发展妇女民兵近二千人。人民武装在自卫战争中已获得很大光辉战绩，除前已报导者外，尚有如皋驾南乡民兵，共俘蒋军一千一百三十名，缴获战马四匹、电台二座，该乡商凌村村长张万和，用徒手捉到八个俘虏，缴获一座电台。如皋王鸣村王村长，在丁堰凭徒手缴到两枝步枪，（其中一枝为“卡宾”式）归途中发现一蒋军伏在小沟内，王村长大喝“敢动！打死你！”蒋军立即缴出了一挺轻机枪。铜雎县张圩区某乡民兵队长领着十人，于本月五日夜袭侵占海郑公路上岚山之蒋军，乘蒋军熟睡时，先搬走一挺机枪，待蒋军惊醒仓皇逃窜时，又击毙其十名俘三名，缴获步枪十余枝。泗南县三召乡民兵，夺回被蒋军劫掉之盐船三艘，毙伤蒋军三名。\n    【新华社临沂十七日电】山东各地民兵，在被蒋军侵占地区，广泛展开麻雀战、爆炸战与地雷战，给进犯军以有力打击。胶县及即墨两地民兵，一月来配合少数主力部队，阻击向两县边界地区进犯之蒋军五十四军两个团，在蒋军进犯路上，埋设地雷百余颗，全部爆炸，杀伤蒋军七十余。在各地作战中，共缴获步枪二百六十余枝，手枪弹一千二百余颗，小炮四门，机枪三挺。鲁南临城民兵，于上月三十日伏击由城内东犯之蒋军，诱其陷入地雷阵，一声轰隆，蒋军连长以下二十二名立即毙命。鲁中博山县八陡区民兵，连日困扰百余蒋军，于奇袭中击伤蒋军连长一名士兵若干名，蒋军恼羞成怒，倾巢出犯，作报复进攻，民兵以神奇的麻雀战，与之周旋，蒋军到处扑空，疲惫沮丧而返。"

    "content": "The People of Anyang Under Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Oppression\n    Han Hua\n    Of the 700,000 people in Anyang, half of the vast population, excluding the liberated areas, are still struggling under the Kuomintang's tyranny. In the eastern and northeastern parts of Anyang, covering an area of approximately 2,200 square miles, the puppet army of Wang Ziquan and Cheng Daosheng, two bandit and traitor leaders whom the people have long hated to the bone, are entrenched. The Kuomintang uses them to carry out疯狂extortion and barbaric suppression of the people.\n\n    The three stubborn puppet strongholds—Anyang City, Cuijiaqiao, and Cheng Taibao—gather thousands upon thousands of peasants every day. They abandon their fields and spend their days building houses and fortifications for the stubborn puppets. The puppet army leader Cheng Daosheng, in order to build his private residence, forcibly requisitions from each bao a large beam of 24 feet in length, as well as a large amount of wood, bricks, and stones, to build a magnificent courtyard and a palatial building in Taibao Village. He also dug five large circular pits, each about ten feet deep and covering an area of one mu, with wheat straw padded around the pits and at the bottom. He then filled them with wheat forcibly requisitioned from various villages, which was transported by carts and carried on shoulders. Three pits are already full and piled more than ten feet above the ground. It is said that more than ten thousand dan of wheat have already been delivered, and the carts continuously transporting wheat to Taibao are still increasing!\n\n    Another puppet army leader, Wang Ziquan, in order to defend his old lair—Cuijiaqiao, which he has occupied for more than ten years, still feels that the earth stronghold, blockhouses, moats, and electric fences built with the people's blood and sweat are not secure enough. Therefore, starting in late June, he began to conscript laborers to widen the original earth stronghold by five feet and to cover the entire寨wall with two layers of wooden planks, so that even if炮弹 landed on the寨wall, it would not harm anyone. He wants to turn Cuijiaqiao into an eternal魔窟.\n\n    Anyang City and Weishang Village (Yuanzhai), where the 40th Army is stationed, have been digging ditches since the beginning of June. They dug环城blockade ditches and城河. They don't care if there is a drought that prevents sowing or if the land is荒废and cannot be hoed. They ordered each bao to provide 100 laborers every day. If one person is missing, they will be fined 6,000 yuan. Many places have already dug water up to their knees, but it is still not considered complete, and they declared that the work would not stop until August 15th (Mid-Autumn Festival).\n\n    Thousands upon thousands of peasant masses are working tirelessly under the scorching sun. The sweat on their heads flows into the mud at their feet, and everyone is drenched as if they had just taken a bath.\n\n    Every three or four feet away, there is a supervisor holding a wooden stick, smoking洋烟, and wearing a military uniform. He constantly yells: \"Damn it, work faster! Work faster!\"\n\n    In addition to manual labor, livestock and vehicles are also constantly being requisitioned.\n\n    \"Exemption from one year of grain tax and suspension of one year of military service\" have all been clearly stipulated by the National Government. However, in the face of the people of Anyang, it is just like Chiang Kai-shek's four promises, not only slapping himself in the face but also doubling the endless levy. The puppet troops of Wang and Cheng can directly levy grain and demand money without going through the government or local乡公所, and they can ask for whatever amount they want, and no one dares to bargain.\n\n    From the first month of the lunar calendar to half a year after the wheat harvest, puppet army leader Cheng Daosheng has collected rice, wheat, firewood, money, bran, etc., equivalent to five dou of wheat per mu. The masses are impoverished in the spring when the new crops are not yet ripe. Nine out of ten families are empty. Selling庄田 is useless. The官兵 urge payment like wildfire, so they have to borrow money publicly in the village. For every shi of wheat borrowed, one shi and five dou (five dou of interest) must be repaid after the wheat harvest. They hope to repay the principal and interest after a good harvest in May, but who knew that the harvest in May was only 50%. The highest yield per mu was six dou, and the lowest was two dou, but the levy by the stubborn puppet troops became even more outrageous. As of June, Fengsu and Lücun had already collected the equivalent of eight dou and five sheng of wheat per mu (including interest), and Pangjiawan and Qicun seven dou. An old man from ×× village told me哭着: \"I planted sixty mu of land and harvested eight shi of wheat, and selling two mules to pay the burden was not enough. My family of four had nothing to eat just after May.\" Finally, in a懇乞tone, he said to me: \"I don't know if I can go to the west (referring to the liberated area)? I really plan to sell the materials and waterwheels in my house and move to the Shuiye area in Fuxi.\" There are too many people with the same fate as this old man. The vast peasant masses really cannot live on, and they are brewing \"letting the land and leaving their hometowns.\"\n\n    In the area of puppet army Wang Ziquan, this spring, every dingyang (equivalent to six mu of land) has already paid 145 jin of fine grain (rice and wheat), two jin of cotton, two jin of pig iron, a pair of shoes, more than 2,000 jin of firewood, and bran, etc. After May (after the wheat harvest), every dingyang paid another 360 jin of wheat. In late June, every 100 yuan of dingyang was conscripted for one soldier. Generally, villages pay from one million to 1.4 million yuan to buy a壮丁, and after signing a contract guaranteeing that they will not desert, they send them off. The cost of buying soldiers alone is another 10,000 yuan or tens of thousands of yuan per dingyang. According to the settlement of general villages for half a year, the burden per mu is more than five dou (23 jin per dou) of wheat (including stubborn puppet burden). I met a farmer named Li in Guocun who sighed and said: \"Alas! This year,命is required in any case.\"\n\n    Since Japan surrendered last year, the people of Anyang, like other regions of the country, celebrated the victory of the anti-Japanese war with狂欢 and thought that they could be free from the bloody rule of traitors and puppets for the past eight years. People waited with wide eyes to see the execution of the traitorous heads—Li Ying, Wang Ziquan, and Cheng Daosheng—who recognized thieves as their fathers. Who knew that after the victory, these extremely sinful puppet army heads would not only not be executed in front of the people but would instead become the darlings of today's Kuomintang reactionaries. Thus, Anyang's traitorous group and the Kuomintang's powerful figures, Zhao Zhichen (专员), Yao Anzhi (县长), and Sun Ziqing (党部书记长), became even closer and launched a two-pronged attack on the people.\n\n    In the rural areas of the stubborn puppet region, no matter which corner you go to, you can see soldiers holding clubs in groups of three or five, or small armed forces in班s and排s. Sometimes, there are as many as five or six units simultaneously催粮款or firewood in one village. They are like wild beasts that eat people, chasing after the保长 to collect them in the streets. If they speak improperly or are slow to get the money, the wet willow sticks will be狠狠ly added to them. Often, many villages cannot find a man. Four grain-collecting soldiers under the puppet Cheng Daosheng, while beating people in Pangjiawan in mid-June, shouted: \"This is the order of Commissioner Zhao. Beating is the consequence of taking the payment slowly\"! A platoon leader under the puppet Wang Ziquan led more than a dozen armed soldiers and went to Xiyangdian to collect grain. The 甲长, Sun Yuming,懇乞ed the platoon leader, saying: \"If you ask for more, you will force the people to death.\" One sentence angered the platoon leader's dignity. With a shout, the soldiers knocked Sun Yuming to the ground, and five or six wet willow sticks扑嗤, 扑嗤! Instantly, he was beaten until he was covered in blood and unconscious. After being carried home, he died in a few days. This matter spread throughout the area, and the保甲长 in various villages were惶恐不安 as soon as they heard: \"The grain-collecting soldiers are here\"! The 保长 of Baode and four or five other villages fled for their lives because of this.\n\n    In short, the people of Anyang, groaning under the iron fist of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets, can no longer live on. They are calling for救命!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋伪奴役下的安阳人民\n韩华\n1946-08-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋伪奴役下的安阳人民\n    韩华\n    安阳七十万人口中，除解放区以外，尚有二分之一的广大人民，正在国民党暴政下喘息着。在安阳的东部和东北部，面积约两千二百余方里的地面上，盘踞着伪军王自全和程道生两个人民早已恨之入骨的土匪汉奸头子，国民党通过他们对人民进行疯狂的榨取与野蛮的镇压。\n    三个顽伪大据点——安阳城、崔家桥、和程太保，每天都集结着成千成万的农民。他们荒废了自己的田园，整日替顽伪修房造屋建筑工事。伪军头子程道生，为了建筑私人的住宅，每保强征两丈四尺长的大梁一根，及大量的木料砖石等物，要在太保寨内盖一所华丽的庭院，堂皇的大楼。并挖了五个深约一丈，面积一亩的圆形大土坑，土坑的周围及坑底垫上麦糠，装进大小车辆推推挑挑从各村暴征的麦子，现有三个坑已经装满，并堆出地面一丈多高。据说：已送到的麦子，已有一万几千石了，而且连续不绝向太保送麦的车辆还正多着呢！\n    另一伪军头子王自全为了坚守盘踞十年以上的老窝——崔家桥，除了已经为人民血汗所筑成的土寨、炮楼、寨壕、电网外，还嫌不大保险，所以从六月下旬开始，便又征集民夫将原来的土寨，再向外加修五尺宽，并将整个寨墙用木板棚作两层，使炮弹落到寨墙上也不会伤人，要想把崔家桥变成万世魔窟。\n    安阳城以及四十军驻守的渭上村（袁宅）等据点，从六月初开始，便一直没有停止挖沟，挖了环城封锁沟又挖城河，他们那管你天旱不能下种，地荒不能锄刨，下令每保每日出夫一百名，少了一名罚洋六千元。许多地方已经挖出膝盖深的水，还不能算完，并且他们声言：到八月十五（中秋节）也不能停工。\n    成千累万的农民群众，在酷热的烈日下无休息的劳作，头上的汗流到脚下的泥水里，个个都是湿淋淋的好似刚洗过澡一样。\n    每隔三四丈远的距离，便有一个手提木棍，口衔洋烟身穿着军服的监工，他不时吆喝着：“他妈的，快干！快干！”\n    除了人工劳役外，牲口车辆，也整年不停的支差。\n    “免征一年粮赋，停止一年兵役”，都经过国民政府的明令规定，可是它在安阳人民面前也和蒋介石的四项诺言一样，不仅是自己打自己的嘴巴，而且是加倍的无止境的征收，王、程两部的伪军可以不经过政府及地方乡公所，就直接摊粮要款，而且说多少就是多少，谁也不敢还价钱。\n    伪军程道生，从旧历正月至麦后半年为止，所征米、麦、烧柴、款项、麸料等，每亩折合小麦五斗，群众在春天青黄不接之时，十室九空，变卖庄田无有受主，而官兵催款又如星火，便只有经村中公伙揭债，每批（揭债）麦一石到麦收后即还一石五斗（利息五斗），指望着五月丰收以后偿还本利，岂知五月的收成只有五成，每亩收额，最高六斗、低者二斗，而且顽伪军的征收却更变本加厉，截至六月份为止冯宿、吕村每亩已合小麦八斗五升（利息在内），庞家湾、奇村七斗，××村一个老汉哭着告诉我说：“我种着六十亩地，打了八石麦子，卖了两个骡子填到负担里还不够，全家四口人刚过了五月就没啥吃。”最后以恳乞的态度向我说：“西边（指解放区）不知能去不能？我真打算把家里的物料、水车卖掉，搬到府西水冶一带去住。”像这老汉一样命运的人实在太多了，广大的农民群众确已不能生活下去，他们正酝酿着“让地离乡”。\n    伪军王自全地区，今春每丁洋（合地六亩）已出细粮（米麦）一百四十五斤，棉花二斤，生铁二斤，鞋一双，烧柴两千余斤以及麸草等，五月后（麦后）又每丁洋出小麦三百六十斤，六月下旬每一百元丁洋征兵一个，一般村子都是以百万至一百四十万元买一个壮丁，并经过立约担保（保证不开小差）送去的。单买兵费每丁洋即又摊一万元或一万几千元，据一般村子半年的结算，每亩负担均在五斗（每斗二十三斤）小麦以上（顽伪负担均在内）。我曾遇到郭村一个姓李的农民长叹了一口气对我说：“唉！这年头横竖是要命”。\n    自去年日本投降以后，安阳人民也和全国其他地区一样：在狂欢的颂扬抗战胜利，以为从此便可以解脱八年来奸伪的血腥统治，人们张大了双眼等待着看看认贼作父的汉奸头子——李英、王自全、程道生的伏法，岂知胜利了，这些罪大恶极的伪军头子，非但不能在人民面前伏法，反而却成为今天国民党反动派的宠儿，于是安阳的汉奸集团和国民党的当权者赵质宸（专员）、姚安之（县长）、孙子青（党部书记长）却益形亲密起来，双管齐下的向人民进攻了。\n    在顽伪区的农村，不管你走到那一个角落，都可以看见三五成群，手持棍棒的军人，或成班成排的小型武装。有时一个村同时坐催粮款或烧柴的军人，竟有五六个单位之多。他们都像吃人的野兽一样，追迫着保长绕街催讨，一时说话不当或拿款迟慢，湿柳棍便会狠狠的加到他们身上，往往打得许多村竟找不到一个男人。伪程道生部下四个催粮兵，六月中的一日在庞家湾打人时，还高喊着：“这是赵专员的命令，拿款慢了就是打”！伪王自全部下的一个排长带领了十几个武装士兵，在西羊店催粮时，甲长孙玉明以求乞的态度向该排长说：“再要就把老百姓都逼死了”。一句话触怒了排长的尊严，一声吆喝：士兵们便将孙玉明放倒在地，五六条湿柳棍扑嗤，扑嗤！顿时打的鲜血淋漓不省人事，后经抬至家中，数日即死。此事传遍了各地，各村保甲长一听说：“来了催粮兵”！便都惶恐不安。鲍德等四五个村的保长，便都因此外出逃命。\n    总之，呻吟在蒋伪铁缔下的安阳人民，已经不能生活下去，他们在呼唤救命！"

Over 1,000 troops of the Chiang military's 81st Division of the 55th Army and the Kuomintang Qi County Security Regiment were completely annihilated, with numerous spoils captured. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. Note: Qi County was liberated by the Eighth Route Army, which persisted in the anti-Japanese resistance behind enemy lines in eastern Henan, last August, and was re-occupied by Liu Ruzhen's troops of the Kuomintang army in mid-October. The Chiang army constructed a moat around the city, with exceptionally solid defensive fortifications, but these were ultimately destroyed by the heroic Eighth Route Army soldiers, and the people of the entire city have regained their liberation.\n    [Reported from Heze on the 17th by this newspaper] Our Eighth Route Army units recaptured Tongxu City at 11:00 AM on the 16th. The battle began at dawn, and of the Chiang army's security regiment of over 300 men, most were annihilated by our forces, with only a small number escaping. In this battle, 500 rifles, 3,000 rounds of ammunition, and countless other spoils were captured. Note: This city was liberated from the Japanese invaders by our eastern Henan Eighth Route Army on August 17th last year, and re-occupied by Liu Ruzhen's Chiang army on October 9th. The vast populace of the occupied area, who had suffered from the trampling and devastation of the Chiang army, are all celebrating the recapture. Order in the city is currently being restored.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Heze, 17th] Our correspondent on the Longhai Front reports: At 10:00 PM on the 11th, during the fierce battle between the Jilu Yu Eighth Route Army in self-defense and the Chiang army in Lanfeng City, a column of armored vehicles suddenly arrived from Kaifeng, carrying the direct unit of the 18th Brigade (formerly the 18th Division) of the 18th Division (formerly the 18th Army) of the Chiang army. This Chen Cheng's elite force, entirely equipped with American weapons, was largely annihilated near the station within minutes of engaging in fierce fighting. Note: This unit was personally commanded and trained by Chen Cheng during the ten years of civil war, and was a notorious anti-communist and anti-people armed force. It was originally responsible for guarding Wuhan, and recently, under Chen Cheng's cry for a \"military showdown\" with the Communist Party, was transferred from Hankou to attack the liberated areas of eastern Henan and northern Anhui. According to a captured officer of this unit, \"Our mission in coming north was to attack the liberated areas and to monitor the miscellaneous troops. Unexpectedly, we were annihilated within minutes of engaging in battle.\"\n    [Urgent telegram from Yangcheng on the 17th by this newspaper] After defeating the attack of the puppet troops under Zhang Conglong in Hongdong City, the Taiyue Eighth Route Army pointed its sharp edge westward and continued to liberate Hongdong County, a famous cotton and wheat producing area in southern Shanxi, on the 16th. Note: After the Japanese surrender, Hongdong City was still occupied by the notoriously sinful traitorous county magistrate Zhang Conglong. Later, Yan Xishan appointed him as county magistrate and reorganized Zhang's puppet troops into the Hongdong Corps. Since Zhang Conglong occupied Hongdong, he committed all kinds of evils against the people of the county, including arson, murder, and plunder, creating a \"no-man's land\" of several dozen li in Hexi and east and west Fengbao. This time, Zhang Conglong actually coordinated with the Chiang army offensive in southern Shanxi, attacking the Fengli area, fifteen li east of the county seat, on the 14th. The local military and civilians immediately launched a self-defensive counterattack that night, destroying strongholds such as Jiacun, captured Yufeng Mountain on the 15th, and entered the city at about 7:00 PM on the 16th. After two and a half hours of street fighting, Hongdong City was liberated by our Eighth Route Army. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. At the same time, our Taiyue Eighth Route Army launched an attack on the Yan puppet troops in Huoxian, capturing Xingzhi Station, twenty li south of Huoxian, on the 14th. In the battle, five blockhouses were captured successively, and two locomotives were seized. By 13:00 on the 15th, we had completely controlled the railway line for more than ten li north and south of the station. The results of the battle are still expanding. At this point, Zhaocheng is completely isolated.\n    [Reported from Yangcheng on the 16th by this newspaper] Zhang Faquan, deputy platoon leader of the First Company of the First Battalion of Yan Jun's \"Love the Hometown Corps\" in Xiangling, unwilling to participate in the civil war, led his entire platoon in an uprising on the 5th of this month to oppose the civil war. However, because the matter was not kept secret, it was discovered by Yan's special agents, and the uprising failed. The entire platoon was disarmed. Platoon Leader Zhang Faquan seized the opportunity to escape with two squad leaders, carrying a machine gun, a rifle, and a grenade launcher, and defected to the nearby Eighth Route Army defense area to participate in the patriotic movement. Our local military and civilians warmly welcomed them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陇海同蒲前线再传捷报  解放杞县通许洪洞  杞城之战我消灭蒋军千余陈诚嫡系精锐一部被歼灭于兰封\n\n1946-08-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陇海同蒲前线再传捷报\n    解放杞县通许洪洞\n    杞城之战我消灭蒋军千余陈诚嫡系精锐一部被歼灭于兰封\n    【本报荷泽十七日电】我八路军某部配合豫东地方武装，于十四日夜乘胜一举恢复豫东解放区中心县份杞县县城，蒋军五十五军八十一师部队及国民党杞县保安团一千余人全部就歼，缴获甚多，战果正清查中。按：杞县去年八月为我坚持豫东敌后抗战的八路军所解放，十月中旬复为国民党军刘汝珍部所侵占，蒋军在该城构筑环城水濠，防御工事异常坚固，但终为英勇的八路军健儿所摧毁，全城人民重获解放。\n    【本报荷泽十七日电】我八路军一部于十六日上午十一时光复通许城。战斗于拂晓开始，蒋军之保安团共三百余人，除少数突围逃走，大部为我歼灭。此役缴获步枪五百支，子弹三千发，其他胜利品无算。按：该城于去年八月十七日为我豫东八路军自日寇手中解放，十月九日为蒋军刘汝珍所侵占。此次光复，被占区之广大人民因受蒋军蹂躏摧残，莫不称庆，现该城秩序正在恢复中。\n    【新华社荷泽十七日电】本社陇海前线记者报导：十一日晚十时，在冀鲁豫八路军自卫反击与蒋军激战于兰封城时，突从开封开来装甲车一列，载有蒋军十八师（原十八军）十八旅（原十八师）直属队。这支全部美械装备的陈诚嫡系部队，于展开激战数分钟后，即被大部歼灭于车站附近。按：该部为陈诚在十年内战中所亲手指挥训练者，为有名的反共反人民武装，原负责警备武汉，近在陈诚叫嚣要与共产党“武力决赛”的口号下，由汉口调来，向豫东淮北解放区进攻。据俘获之该部某军官称：“我们此次北来，一方面为进攻解放区，同时还有监视杂牌军之任务，不料在交战数分钟内就被歼灭了”。\n    【本报阳城十七日急电】太岳八路军于击溃洪洞城内伪军张从龙部进攻后，锐锋西指，十六日继续解放晋南著名棉麦产区之洪洞县城。按：日本投降以后，洪洞城仍为罪恶昭彰之汉奸县长张逆从龙盘踞，后经阎锡山加委为县长，又将张逆伪部编为洪洞兵团。张逆自盘踞洪洞后，对该县人民烧杀掠夺，无恶不作，造成河西以及东西冯堡数十里之“无人区”。此次张逆竟配合晋南蒋军攻势，于十四日向县城以东十五里的封里地区进攻，当地军民即于是夜实行自卫反击，摧毁贾村等据点，十五日攻克玉峰山，十六日下午七时许攻入城内，巷战两小时半，洪洞城即为我八路军解放，战果现正清查中。与此同时，我太岳八路军分向霍县阎伪进击，于十四日攻占霍县以南二十里之幸置车站，在战斗中，先后攻下碉堡五座，缴获火车头两个。至十五日十三时，我已将该车站南北十余里之铁路线全部控制，战果仍在继续扩大中。至此，赵城已完全陷于孤立。\n    【本报阳城十六日电】阎军襄陵“爱乡团”第一营第一连副排长张发全，不愿内战，于本月五日率领全排起义，反对内战，但因事机不密，为阎特发觉，致起义未遂，全排被缴械。张发全排长乘机随偕班长二人，携机枪一挺，步枪一支，掷弹筒一个，投奔附近八路军防地参加爱国运动，我当地军民予以热烈欢迎。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 14th: The Kuomintang authorities recently organized a Chinese and foreign journalist inspection group to fly over the flood area in northern Jiangsu for aerial inspection, attempting to cover up their conspiracy of using flooding caused by bombing river embankments to aid military offensives and to verify the fabricated rumors that the Communist Party \"breached the dikes\" in northern Jiangsu, in order to shift the blame onto others. The flood area inspected by the group was caused by the Yangzhou Kuomintang authorities preventing the Yangtze River from receiving water from the Grand Canal since June of this year. Many foreign reporters from France, Britain, and Canada who participated in the inspection reported that this trip yielded no results. The Kuomintang authorities' habitual trick of distorting the truth through propaganda organs has once again been declared a failure. It has been a long-standing practice for the Kuomintang authorities to use dike breaching and flooding as a tool for political and military struggle. (1) As early as June of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Kuomintang authorities sent troops to breach the dikes at Huayuankou in Henan, diverting the Yellow River, drowning more than 300,000 innocent people and impoverishing more than 1.7 million. (2) In the spring of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), Yin Kaizhi, the Kuomintang magistrate of Taikang County, was ordered to breach the dikes in the area south of Cuiqiao in the county. (3) In May of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Twelfth Commissioner's Office of the Henan Provincial Government of the Kuomintang breached the dikes at Qizi Xu again. (4) In June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), Zhang Jingzhong, the county magistrate of Wuzhi County, and Meng Yunwu, the district chief, dug open the Mian River dike between Donghongqiao and Wuchekou within the county. (5) After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, on September 10th of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Cao Shiyi's Kuomintang Weishi Security Regiment breached three openings in the Yellow River dike south of Zhuxian Town. (6) In September of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Xu Tieying and Wang Zemin troops, incorporated by the Kuomintang, breached the Puyang River east of Yongnian County. (7) In September of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Xu Chunlin troops, formerly puppet troops incorporated by the Kuomintang stationed in Botou Town, breached the Grand Canal dike at the Dawangmiao section south of Bonan; in January of this year, the troops breached the Grand Canal dike again. (8) In March of this year, the Kuomintang obstructed the construction of the Grand Canal, using airplanes to wantonly strafe the river construction workers in the Liubao area of Baoying; on April 8th, at the Liujiao section of Shaobo, the 118th Regiment of the Kuomintang stationed troops strafed the river construction workers with machine guns. (9) In May of this year, the Kuomintang did everything possible to obstruct the Feihe dredging project. (10) Since June of this year, the Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou have blocked all dams leading to the Yangtze River, preventing the Grand Canal from flowing into the river, creating an artificial flood in Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua and other places in the liberated areas of Jiangsu and Anhui (this is what the Kuomintang propaganda organs are clamoring about). (11) Since July, they have continuously bombed various sections of the embankments of the Grand Canal and Shu River in Jiangsu and Anhui, and strafed the canal repair workers everywhere. On July 21st, canal repair workers in Zaohe Town were strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, resulting in nine deaths and injuries; on July 29th, a UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) ship carrying summer flood prevention supplies for the Grand Canal, docked at Wangying, Huaiyin, was sunk by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, resulting in 32 deaths and injuries. (12) In July of this year, Kuomintang troops and the puppet troops incorporated by them in Jing'an, Jinghai, and Dacheng and other places destroyed the Jia Kou and Zhan Wa diversion works which had just been completed. (13) In July of this year, the Kuomintang army and puppet bandits in Shijiazhuang destroyed the Haojin Canal, a large-scale project along the Tuo River. (14) On July 27th of this year, the Jiang army Zhang Huatang's troops stationed in Cang County and the puppet troops Li Jingwen and Wang Yongsheng's troops dispatched troops to Zhao Chengzi for the third time to breach the dikes, opening a breach of more than fifty feet twice, as of May 10th and July 23rd.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 颠倒是非乃国民党宣传惯技  苏北泛区视察欺骗破产  英法等外记者咸称此行毫无结果\n\n1946-08-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　颠倒是非乃国民党宣传惯技\n    苏北泛区视察欺骗破产\n    英法等外记者咸称此行毫无结果\n    【新华社延安十四日电】国民党当局，于日前组织一个中外记者视察团，飞临苏北泛区作空中视察，企图以此掩盖其利用伏泛轰炸河堤制造水灾以补助军事进攻之阴谋，并证实其中共在苏北“决堤”的造谣，以便嫁祸于人。该团所视察的水灾区，乃是由于扬州国民党当局在今年六月以来，阻止运河涨水入江所致。许多参加视察的法、英、加外籍记者俱有报导，认为此行毫无结果。国民党当局利用宣传机关颠倒是非的惯技，又一次宣告破产。查国民党当局利用决堤放水造灾作为政治军事斗争工具，不自今日始。（１）远在民国廿七年六月，国民党当局即曾派军队在河南花园口决堤使黄河改道，无辜人民被淹毙者三十余万，倾家荡产者一百七十万以上。（２）二十九年春，国民党太康县长尹楷之，奉命在该县崔桥以南地区决堤。（３）三十年五月，国民党河南省政府十二专员公署又在凄子湑决堤。（４）三十二年六月，武陟县长张敬忠、区长孟运吾，在县境东虹桥至五车口间掘开沔河堤。（５）抗战胜利后三十四年九月十日，国民党尉氏保安团曹世一部，在朱仙镇以南将黄河堤连决三口。（６）三十四年九月，国民党收编之许铁英、王泽民部，在永年县东决开滏阳河。（７）三十四年九月，驻泊头镇国民党收编之伪军徐春林部，将运河泊南大王庙段河堤决口；今年一月该部又再度扒决运河堤岸。（８）今年三月，国民党阻扰兴修运河，用飞机在宝应刘堡区一带，大肆扫射修河民夫；四月八日，在邵伯六角一段，国民党驻军一一八团用机枪扫射修河民夫。（９）今年五月，国民党百般阻扰淝河修浚工程。（１０）今年六月以来，扬州国民党当局堵塞归江各坝，阻止运河涨水入江，造成苏皖解放区高邮、宝应、兴化等地人造水灾（此即国民党宣传机关所叫嚣者）。（１１）七月以来，对苏皖境内运、沭等河各段堤岸不断轰炸，并到处扫射修运工人。七月二十一日，皂河镇一带修运民夫遭蒋机扫射死伤九人；二十九日，停泊淮阴王营的联总补助运河夏防物资船一艘被蒋机击沉，死伤三十二人。（１２）今年七月，景安、静海、大城等地国民党军及其收编之伪军，破坏甫告完成的景安贾口、詹洼导河入海工程。（１３）今年七月，石家庄国民党军及伪匪，破坏了沱河沿岸规模巨大的豪晋渠。（１４）今年七月二十七日，驻沧县蒋军张华堂部及伪军李景文、王永胜部，第三次出动到赵程子扒堤，决开堤岸五十余丈口两次，为五月十日及七月二十三日。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Shanghai Report: The spokesman for the Shanghai branch of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association issued a lengthy statement at the end of last month, responding to Madame Soong Ching Ling's statement. The spokesman stated: \"As Madame Sun said, the mutual encouragement between the Chinese and American reactionaries is the main reason for the expansion and development of the current civil war in China. They vainly attempt to use this to trigger a US-Soviet war, and then finally crush the Chinese Communist Party.\" The spokesman criticized the Chinese reactionaries' \"military unification\" line as a line that will lead to national subjugation and racial extinction. He pointed out: \"The United States' demands on China are nothing more than wanting to develop trade with China and use China as its military base in the Far East. However, as a result of the prolonged and expanded civil war, more than 90 percent of the Chinese people will be impoverished. The suffering of the Chinese people caused by the civil war will all be written on the United States' account. Furthermore, the Chinese people absolutely cannot agree to use China as a military base for other countries to fight wars.

Before a coalition government that truly represents the will of the people is established, temporarily suspend all military and economic aid to China, in order to quickly extinguish the flames of the Chinese civil war that may spread to the other side of the Pacific Ocean -- the United States.\"\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th: According to Shanghai reports, Reuters Nanjing reported: Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, pointed out in a speech on the 4th that the bombing of Yan'an proves that the civil war has reached a holistic stage.

    "content": "The Counter-Attack at Lanfeng City\n\n　　Lanfeng was an important military stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the Longhai Railway, concentrating a large number of troops and tanks, constantly attacking our liberated areas.\n\n　　Since last year, after Chiang's troops occupied our counties of Qi, Taikang, Tongxu, Fugou, Minquan, and Kaocheng, they recently deployed troops and generals to attack the Third and Fifth Sub-districts north of the Longhai Railway. Although our army has been retreating step by step, Chiang's troops have been pressing closer and closer. On the evening of the 10th of this month, our local Eighth Route Army, unable to endure it any longer, was forced to launch a self-defensive counter-attack against the invading troops, cutting off the main artery of Chiang's troops' transportation of troops and weapons – the Longhai Railway – and liberating Lanfeng City.\n\n　　(1) Heroic and Tragic Battle Mobilization\n\n　　Before the battle, the head of a certain unit issued a powerful call to all commanders and fighters. He called on every commander and fighter to bring out our patriotic and people-loving enthusiasm and courage to eliminate the traitorous army and strive to be a hero in killing the enemy, a model worker, and strive for victory in the battle. This call quickly generated a powerful force among all commanders and fighters. Each unit responded to this call with the highest enthusiasm and proposed competitions and challenges. Among all the commanders and fighters of Unit 6052, after the competition was proposed, every commander and fighter was determined to sacrifice. Zhao Wengang, the acting squad leader of the Third Squad, handed over his 3,000 Jiao of Hebei currency and 500 yuan in stocks as Party dues and made a will. Deputy Instructor Hou Jianjun also resolved to sacrifice, handed over his savings of 9,000 yuan as Party dues, and left three photos as souvenirs. In Unit 6050, 90% of the Communist Party members expressed their attitude. Many cadres and soldiers were determined to sacrifice, handing over all their savings to the public. Squads, platoons, teams, cooks, and communicators all formulated their own combat plans, determined to strive to complete the competition plan.\n\n　　(2) The Restoration of Lanfeng City\n\n　　The Second Company of Unit 6046 was responsible for launching a self-defensive counter-attack against the invading troops. Just ten minutes after the charge was launched, the Second Company was already standing on the head of Lanfeng City. The first comrade to climb the city was Cui Guizhen of the Sixth Squad. When his heroic figure appeared on the head of Lanfeng City, the sound of exploding machine guns and hand grenades powerfully depicted the emergence of a hero. In the storm of steel, he showed his firm and tenacious heroic qualities. Although the Second Company was a new recruit company established only last year, they all demonstrated a high degree of bravery and skill in combat. It only took five minutes to rush into the city. In the charge, the company commander, political instructor, and second and third platoon engineers were wounded one after another. The political instructor walked with a limp, but everyone refused to leave the front line. They had only one determination: to quickly eliminate the enemy. The wounded company commander commanded the troops without stopping, continuing to fight the enemy. The enemies in Lanfeng City surrendered one after another. Only a portion of the remaining Chiang Kai-shek troops and a tank company, totaling more than 300 people, were still using their new weapons to attack us fiercely. Our army bravely rushed up, and by six o'clock, all the tanks were lying quietly on our army's position. This tank unit was originally the tank squadron of the Fourth Appeasement Zone under the Zhengzhou Appeasement Headquarters of Chiang's army. It had been in Lanfeng for more than 40 days, its purpose being to cooperate with the infantry to attack the liberated areas. The tank equipment included a flat-firing gun and two light machine guns per tank. Now, it has become an irony of Chiang Kai-shek's internal war of national betrayal. The flag of independence and freedom was planted on the head of Lanfeng City for the first time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 兰封城的反击战\n\n1946-08-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　兰封城的反击战\n    兰封是蒋介石军队在陇海铁路上的重要军事据点，集中了大量的部队和坦克，不断向我解放区进攻。\n    自去年蒋军将我杞县、太康、通许、扶沟、民权、考城等县城侵占后，近又调兵遣将，向陇海路以北三、五分区进攻，我军虽节节退让，蒋军则步步紧逼。本月十日晚，我当地八路军在忍无可忍下，被迫问进犯军作自卫反攻，割断了蒋军运输军队武器的大动脉——陇海铁路，解放了兰封城。\n            （一）英勇壮烈的战斗动员\n    某部首长在战斗前，向全军指战员发出了有力的号召，他号召每一个指战员，都拿出我们爱国爱人民的热忱与勇敢，去消灭卖国贼的军队，争取做个杀敌英雄、模范工作者，争取战斗的胜利。这个号召，很快就在全体指战员中产生了强大的力量，各部队以最高的热忱，响应了这一号召，提出了竞赛和挑战。在六○五二部队全体指战员中，当竞赛提出之后，每一个指战员都抱定了牺牲的决心，三分队代理分队长赵文刚同志，交出自己的冀钞三千元，及股票五百元，作为党费，并立下遗嘱；副教导员侯建军也抱定牺牲的决心，交出自己的积蓄九千元的党费，并留下照片三张作为纪念。在六○五○部队中，百分之九十的共产党员，都表示了态度，许多干部战士都下定牺牲决心，把自己多年的积蓄全部交公，连、排、班、炊事员、通讯员都定了自己的战斗计划，决心要争取竞赛计划的完成。\n            （二）兰封城的光复\n    担任向进犯军作自卫反击的是六○四六部队的二连，刚发起冲锋号十分钟，二连就已经站在兰封城头上了，登城的头一名是六班崔桂珍同志，当他的战斗的英姿出现在兰封城头的时候，爆炸成一片的机枪和手榴弹的声音，有力的描写了一个英雄的出现。在钢铁的暴风雨中，表现了他坚定、顽强的英雄本色。二连虽是在去年才成立的新兵连，他们在战斗中，都表现了高度的英勇和熟练，只用了五分钟就冲到城里去了。在冲锋中连长、政指、二、三排工兵先后负伤，政指两腿一拐一拐的走着，大家都不下火线，他们只有一个决心，迅速的消灭敌人。受伤的连长毫不停息的指挥部队，继续和敌人战斗着。在兰封城里的敌人，都先后缴械了，只有一部分残余的蒋介石军队和坦克车连队，共三百余人，仍凭其新式武器向我猛烈攻击，我军奋勇冲上去，至六时全部战车都静静的躺在我军阵地上。这个战车队，本为蒋军驻郑州绥署所辖第四绥区坦克中队，共坦克十一辆、汽车四辆，开来兰封已四十余日，其目的为配合步兵，向解放区进攻。战车装备，每辆坦克装有平射炮一门，轻机枪两挺。现在，成了蒋介石进行卖国内战一个讽刺，独立自由的旗帜第一次插在兰封城头上。"

We are all former subordinates of the Northwest Army and have always regarded loving the country and the people as our duty. However, the reactionary authorities of the Kuomintang not only do not reward these meritorious troops but are also bent on excluding dissidents and forcing attacks on the Eighth Route Army, which had made meritorious contributions in the war against Japan, with the aim of eliminating the miscellaneous troops in one fell swoop in the anti-communist civil war. All officers and soldiers of our division, unwilling for this Northwest people's armed force to be driven by the reactionaries to slaughter their own compatriots, revolted in Luoning, Henan Province, on July 17th last year. Brother, you share this sentiment and resolutely raised the banner of righteousness. This is not only the glory of the officers and soldiers of our Northwest Army but also a head-on blow to the dictators who insist on civil war and betray the country. It is our hope that we can jointly carry forward the glorious tradition of the Northwest Army in the future, cooperate with the Eighth Route Army side by side, and resolutely fight to the end for the independence, democracy, and peace of the motherland. We send this telegram in congratulation and extend our fraternal greetings!\n\n　　Zhang Fuzhen, Liu Weicheng, Liang Lisheng, and all officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army 17th Division respectfully offer their regards.

Anti-British demonstrations occurred yesterday in major Indian cities and London. In Bombay, all Muslim shops were closed that day, and demonstrating Muslim crowds shouted: \"Britain is perfidious!\" \"Partition India!\" No beef was available in Bombay because the city's butchers and beef vendors were all Muslims. Transportation was also paralyzed because most of the car drivers were also Muslims. The British government had previously mobilized hundreds of armed troops to patrol the streets of Bombay, but this did not intimidate the demonstrating Muslim masses. Demonstrations also broke out in Calcutta to protest the British plan for India. British troops opened fire, reportedly killing 80 demonstrators and injuring more than 800. Muslims in Delhi, Lahore, Lucknow, and other northern Indian towns followed the League's call and staged demonstrations. Muhid, a standing committee member of the Muslim League, said in a speech to a student conference: \"We want to declare our independence and are prepared to fight for independence!\" In London, members of the Muslim League gathered from various parts of Britain held a demonstration on the afternoon of the 15th. The procession marched through the city's main streets for two hours, led by Mohammed, chairman of the Muslim League's London branch. Demonstrators held high the Muslim League flag and banners with slogans such as \"The British government goes back on its word,\" \"Rather die than not have Pakistan,\" and \"Take direct action.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对英内阁对印方案  全印回盟发动示威  要求印回分治回民独立\n\n1946-08-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　反对英内阁对印方案\n　  全印回盟发动示威\n　  要求印回分治回民独立\n    【新华社延安十七日电】各方报导：八月十五日为全印回教同盟反对英内阁对印方案的“直接行动日”，印度各大城市及伦敦于昨日发生反英示威。在孟买，当日所有回教商店均已停闭，示威的回教群众高喊：“英国背信弃义”！“印回分治”！孟买全市皆无牛肉可食，因该城之屠夫与牛肉贩皆为回教徒，交通亦陷于麻痹，因大部汽车司机亦为回教徒。事先英政府曾调集数百名武装部队巡逻孟买大街，但并不能将示威的回教群众吓倒。在加尔各答亦爆发示威游行，抗议英国对印方案，英军竟开枪射击，示威群众已知有八十人被打死，八百余人受伤。在德里、拉哈尔、勒克瑙及印度北方诸城镇的回教人士，均遵守回盟之号召，进行示威。回盟常委摩黑德于××学生大会上演说称：“我们要宣布我们的独立，并准备为独立而战！”在伦敦区英国各地汇集而来的回盟员盟于十五日下午举行示威，游行队伍通过该城各主要街道达两小时之久，领导者为回盟伦敦支部主席穆罕默德，示威群众高举回盟盟旗及写着“英政府自食其言”“不是巴基斯坦毋宁死”“直接行动起来”等口号的旗子。"

The fierce battle began at 12:00 PM on the 14th, first clearing out peripheral strongholds such as Motou Station and Sunbao. Then, on the 16th and 17th, they besieged the county seat and Chengguan. More than 1,000 soldiers from Yan Xishan's 69th Division in Huoxian rushed to reinforce from the west of the river on the 17th. At that time, our army was encircling and annihilating and blocking the Yan army in the city. The 69th Division was terrified upon hearing the news and retreated rapidly to the west. Zhaocheng was then restored to us at 3:00 AM. More than 700 people were captured alive, and the seizure of mountain guns (2), mortars (3), and rifles and machine guns is still being verified. Zhaocheng was originally liberated by our army from the Japanese invaders on November 3rd of last year, but was forcibly occupied by the 73rd Division of Yan Xishan's 34th Army on the 22nd. Since the city was occupied by the Yan army, they imposed exorbitant taxes, raped, plundered, and returned the people to the bitter sea. When our army liberated the city, the masses warmly welcomed us, cheering along the streets, celebrating the liberation.\n　　[Telegram from Yangcheng, This Newspaper, 18th] The spokesperson of the Taiyue Military Region recently issued a solemn statement regarding the Taiyue Eighth Route Army eliminating Yan-puppet strongholds in the Hongdong and Zhaocheng areas, cutting off the transportation routes of the Chiang-Yan reactionaries, and preventing the expansion of the civil war, stating: Chiang Kai-shek is mobilizing large armies to continuously enter southern Shanxi, openly refusing the investigation and mediation of the Linfen Executive Group, and his intention to expand the civil war has long been exposed. At present, the Chiang army that has entered the southern Shanxi civil war front has reached eight divisions. Starting from the 13th of this month, they have begun to invade us again. More than 100 villages in the Wenxi and Xiaxian liberated areas have now been invaded again, and they are now attacking Dongzhen, the important town northeast of Wenxi. At the same time, the Yan army along the Tongpu Railway is also intensifying its invasion. The Shanxi Yan army also reassembled its forces last month, coordinating with the Chiang army to attack us from the north and south. In the first half of the month, it dispatched more than 10,000 troops to successively invade and ravage more than 100 villages in the liberated areas of Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, and Huoxian counties. On the 13th of this month, the entire 69th Division was dispatched in an attempt to wipe out our garrison in Huoxian in one fell swoop, and prepared to gradually compress us from north to south from Huoxian to Zhaocheng to Hongdong, occupying all the liberated areas along the Tongpu Railway, in order to open up the line from Linfen to Wenxi and further expand the civil war. Now our army has no way to retreat and cannot bear it any longer, and is forced to launch a counter-offensive, eliminating Yan-puppet strongholds in the Hongdong and Zhaocheng areas and cutting off their transportation routes to prevent them from continuing to reinforce their invasion. We solemnly declare: If the Kuomintang army does not stop invading us for even one day, we will not stop counterattacking for even one day! We must give the warmongers a double blow in order to smash the reactionaries' conspiracy and prevent the expansion of the civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳我军收复洪洞后  乘胜再度解放赵城  太岳军区发言人声明：国民党军一日不停止向我进犯，我将一日不停止反攻！\n\n1946-08-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳我军收复洪洞后\n　  乘胜再度解放赵城\n　  太岳军区发言人声明：国民党军一日不停止向我进犯，我将一日不停止反攻！\n    【本报阳城十九日急电】太岳八路军，于收复洪洞城后，十八日晨三时乘胜再度解放赵城。激战于十四日夜十二时开始，首先扫清磨头车站、孙堡等外围据点，继于十六、十七两日围攻县城及城关，霍县阎军六十九师千余人，即于十七日绕道河西赶来增援，当时我军正于城外围歼、堵击城内阎军，六十九师闻风丧胆向西急退，赵城遂于三时为我恢复。生俘七百余人，缴获山炮二门，迫击炮三门，步机枪正清查中。赵城原为我军去年十一月三日从日寇手中解放，二十二日即被阎军三十四军七十三师强占。该城自被阎军侵占后，横征暴敛，奸淫抢掠，重陷苦海。我军光复该城时，群众热烈欢迎，夹道欢呼，庆幸解放。\n    【本报阳城十八日电】太岳军区发言人，顷就太岳八路军在洪、赵地区扫除阎伪据点，斩断蒋阎反动派运兵路线。制止内战扩大，发表严正声明称：蒋介石正调动大军源源开入晋南，公开拒绝临汾执行小组调查与调处，蓄意扩大内战，早已昭然若揭。目前进入晋南内战前线之蒋军，已达八师之众，本月十三日起，已开始向我再度进犯，闻、夏解放区百余村，刻已被再度侵占，现更向我闻喜东北之重镇——东镇进攻；同蒲沿线阎军之进犯，亦同时更加猖狂，山西阎军亦于上月重新集结兵力，配合蒋军向我南北夹击，上半月出动兵力万余，先后进犯蹂躏我平（遥）介（休）灵（石）霍（县）各县解放区百余村庄。本月十三日更以六十九师全部出犯，企图一举消灭我霍县驻军，并准备由霍县而赵城而洪洞，向我逐步压缩，由北向南，将占我同蒲沿线全部解放区，以打通临汾至闻喜一线，进一步扩大内战。现我军退无可退，忍无可忍，被迫进行反攻，在洪、赵地区扫除阎伪据点，断其运兵路线，以阻止其继续增援进犯。我们严正声明：国民党军一日不停止向我进犯，我将一日不停止反攻！必须给好战者以加倍的打击，方能粉碎反动派之阴谋，制止内战扩大。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Shanghai dispatch: The \"China Weekly Review\" published an article by Conning on the 10th entitled \"What's Wrong with America's China Policy?\" The article pointed out the mistakes of the United States: First, there seems to be some distance between abstract principles and actual practice. In principle, the United States recognizes China's independence, but in practice, its control over China's political, military, and economic affairs seems to indicate that China's independence will not go much further than the kind enjoyed by the Philippines. The United States has publicly stated the need for a democratic China, but it has remained completely silent in the face of a series of fascist atrocities breaking out in China. The statement made by the United States that American troops in China will not be involved in the Chinese civil war and do not need to assist any side has become a lie due to the actions of the US Navy in China at this moment. Second, a successful arbitrator and mediator must be strictly impartial and adhere to accepted terms. Marshall said: The American officers of each executive group should work like impartial umpires in a game, but due to the continued lend-lease to China, the training and supply of Chinese troops, the United States is now tied to the fate of the Kuomintang and has removed its mask of neutrality. The Communists have already suspected the true motives and intentions of the Americans. At the same time, the Kuomintang believes that it can unconditionally obtain American assistance and support when competing with the Communist Party, so it has become more and more unreasonable and unwilling to mediate. The fascist right wing even complains that the United States is not tough enough on the Communist Party. The article concludes that the United States has now reached a time to carefully study and analyze its policy towards China.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Washington dispatch: Professor Michael Lindsay, a British professor of economics at Yenching University who lived in the Chinese Liberated Areas for four years, recently gave a speech at the Pacific Council here. Lindsay strongly stated: Before a competent Chinese coalition government can be formed, the extreme reactionary elements of the Kuomintang must relinquish power, whether they are willing or not. Lindsay declared: If given the opportunity, the progressive elements in the Kuomintang and the CCP will be able to cooperate well. Lindsay said that during the war, 400,000 soldiers and 70 Kuomintang generals in the Chinese government army surrendered to Japan under the command of Chongqing, and now they have returned to Chiang Kai-shek. Lindsay rebuked the Kuomintang government for not punishing those troops who surrendered to Japan. Lindsay continued: The reason why Shanghai is in such a mess is because the central government sent only old, senile, and reactionary elements there; while the CCP's liberated areas have many superior conditions because they have implemented \"tax reforms in agricultural society,\" which is in stark contrast to other regions. Lindsay concluded that if the United States insists on implementing Truman's statement that it will not provide economic assistance to the central government before the Chinese government is expanded, then General Marshall has a chance of success.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 密勒氏评论报发表论文  指责美对华政策错误  林迈可教授在太平洋学会发表演说国民党极端反动分子必须放弃政权\n\n1946-08-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　密勒氏评论报发表论文\n　  指责美对华政策错误\n　　林迈可教授在太平洋学会发表演说国民党极端反动分子必须放弃政权\n    【新华社延安十八日电】沪讯：密勒氏评论报十日刊载柯宁作《美国对华政策的错误在那里？》一文，指出美国的错误：第一、在抽象的原则和实际的实践中间似乎有着一些距离，在原则上美国看见中国的独立，但实践上对中国的政治军事经济方面的统治，似乎中国并不比菲律宾式的独立会更进一步。美国曾公开声明需要一个民主的中国，但面对中国境内一连串爆发的法西斯暴行，却完全沉默不言。美国所作在华美军将不牵入中国内战和不必援助任何一方面的声明，由于美海军此刻在华的作为，已成了一篇谎言。第二、一个成功的排难者和调解人，他必须严格的不偏私，并坚持已接受的条款。马歇尔说：各执行小组的美国军官，应似赛球公正人似的工作，可是由于对华的继续租借，对中国军队的训练和供应，美国已与国民党同命相连，且已取下了中立的面具，共产党人已怀疑美国人的真正动机和意问。同时，国民党相信和共产党相争时，可无条件得到美国的援助和撑腰，所以变得一天比一天不近情理和不愿调停；法西斯右翼尤抱怨美国对共产党不够强硬，该文最后认为：美国现已到了细心研究并分析一下对华政策的时候了。\n    【新华社延安十八日电】华盛顿讯：曾在中国解放区居住四年的前燕大经济系英国教授林迈可氏近在此间太平洋学会发表演说。林氏力称：在可能组成一个胜任的中国联合政府之前，国民党的极端反动分子必须放弃政权，不管他们愿意与否。林氏宣称：如果给予机会，国民党中的进步分子和中共是能够好好地合作的。林氏称：在战争期间，中国政府军中有四十万名士兵和七十名国民党将领在重庆指挥下投降日本，现在又从新归顺蒋介石。林氏斥责国民党政府对那些投降日本的军队迄未施以惩罚。林氏继称：上海之所以搅成乌烟瘴气，就因为中央政府派到那里去的尽是些老朽昏庸的反动分子；而中共解放区之所以有许多优越条件，是因为他们实行了“农业社会的税制改革”，这与其他区域正好形成了强烈的对照。林氏结语称：如果美国坚持执行杜鲁门的声明，在中国政府未扩大前不予中央政府以经济援助，那么马歇尔将军是有机会得到成功的。"

The plan was drafted by Acting Secretary of State Acheson and responsible experts after consultation. Its characteristics are to expand the area and autonomy of the Jewish autonomous region and weaken British power in Palestine. It is reported that the proposed Jewish autonomous region includes the entire northern half of Palestine, except for the western Galilee (area north of the strait) and the Nablus triangle area (north of Jerusalem). In addition, Jewish areas will be delineated in Jerusalem and southern Palestine. (Note: This proposal makes the Jewish area account for half of Palestine, while the original British plan only made the Jewish area account for about a quarter). The plan recommends that Britain should abolish its mandate over Palestine, but maintain military bases there. Truman stated that he would only agree to participate in the Palestine problem conference to be held in London at the end of the month if the above proposal is taken as the basis. According to Reuters, the British government has studied this plan and will publish its attitude towards it in London.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 对于解决巴勒斯坦问题  美向英提出新方案  扩大犹太人自治区削弱英国权力\n\n1946-08-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　对于解决巴勒斯坦问题\n　  美向英提出新方案\n　　扩大犹太人自治区削弱英国权力\n    【新华社延安十八日电】据路透社及合众社讯：杜鲁门于十五日照会英首相艾德礼，再次催促英国立即允许十万犹太人移入巴勒斯坦，并提出解决巴勒斯坦问题的新方案。该方案系美代理国务卿亚泽逊与负责专家会商后所拟，其特点为扩大犹太人自治区面积及其自治权力，削弱英国在巴勒斯坦的权力。据悉建议中的犹太人自治区包括除加里西部（海峡以北地区）奈勃罗斯三角地带（耶露撒冷以北）外的整个巴勒斯坦北半部，此外在耶露撒冷及巴勒斯坦南部划出犹太区。（按：此建议使犹太区占巴勒斯坦之半，而英国原来的计划仅使犹太区占约四分之一）。方案建议英国应取消对巴勒斯坦的委任统治权，而保持在该地的军事基地。杜鲁门表示，只有以上述建议为基础，始同意参加月底在伦敦举行的巴勒斯坦问题会议。据路透社称，英政府已研究此一方案，并将在伦敦发表对此方案的态度。"

Before May, the oppressed people, just like they called the traitor Ma \"Director Ma\" or \"Councilor Ma,\" referred to this residence as \"Ma Mansion.\" Ma's family members were called \"Old Madam Ma,\" \"Eldest Young Master,\" \"Third Young Master,\" etc. When talking about the rise of the Ma family, people would say, \"The Ma family's graves have good feng shui; they have great fortune.\" Those slightly more aware of \"external affairs\" only dared to talk about the \"glorious\" history of Ma Jun himself: \"Back when Yuan Shikai was trying to become emperor, he became a prominent figure, serving as the Hedong Observer; later, he followed Military Governor Yan, becoming the Chief of the Shanxi Military Police Enforcement Office, Hedong Dao Yin, Director of the Industry Department, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Director of the Education Department, and Chairman of the Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Association, as well as a senior councilor.\" Although people didn't know much about his activities after he defected to the enemy in 1943, there was a common saying: \"No matter how he changes, he's always a big shot!\"\n　　In May, earth-shaking changes occurred in Jincheng East Gate. Laboring people, who hadn't dared to say a \"no\" to the Ma family for thirty years, spent over twenty days conducting individual, group, and large-scale accusations, exposing the Ma family's thirty years of dark and oppressive rule and their towering crimes. The Ma family's noble and beautiful exterior and facade were torn apart, and the ugly original form, filled with pus and blood, was exposed before everyone's eyes. According to the strong demands in their hearts for many years, the people changed the name \"Ma Mansion\" to \"Hall of the King of Hell,\" and \"Director Ma\" to \"Old King of Hell\" or \"Dead King of Hell.\" The Ma family members were renamed \"Big King of Hell,\" \"Second King of Hell,\" \"Mother King of Hell,\" \"Little Ghosts\" (servants), and \"Judges\" (housekeepers).\n　　How was \"Ma Mansion\" built? Ma's neighbors, Hui people Chen Jinhai, Chen Yīngou, Chen Qidan, and Han people Yang Songnv, Liu Gengen, Zhang Qundan, Meng Taiyi, etc., knew the details well. With tears in their eyes, they publicly recounted how their ancestors and themselves had saved money frugally for many years to build their houses, only to have them unreasonably seized by the Ma family, forcing them and their entire families to the Dragon King Temple, Grandmother's Temple, and Three Officials Temple, and then seizing all these temples as well, driving them out into the open air, suffering from hunger and cold. They said, \"Ma Mansion, oh Ma Mansion, you were built on the bones of the poor!\" To build his Western-style \"Mansion,\" steel factory, and egg-beating factory (these two factories belonged to the \"Eldest Young Master\"), the traitor Ma forcibly occupied more than three hundred rooms of civilian houses and temples. During construction, the craftsmen were not paid, and those who transported bricks were not paid for their labor. × Xiaodan, an oil craftsman from Zhonghou River, angrily accused: \"We oiled his house for a whole winter, and our hands and feet were so frozen that they cracked open, but he didn't give us a single penny! That's not all; once, when we were so cold that we couldn't bear it, we secretly went to warm ourselves by the fire, and the Eldest Young Master happened to see us! He beat us badly! After beating us, he made us kneel in the snow for a whole day, which caused us to become seriously ill and almost die!\" At that time, there was a folk song in East Gate that said, \"I'd rather have a donkey as a neighbor than hope for a neighbor to pass the imperial examination!\" which reflected these countless grievances. (Note: Ma Jun was a student who studied in England, and the people of East Gate called him a \"foreign successful candidate in the imperial examination.\")\n　　Let the people also accuse what happened after \"Ma Mansion\" was built. The \"Eldest Young Master's\" steel factory (i.e., his mansion) located on the south side of Lower East Gate even occupied the main road, forbidding pedestrians from passing. Li Weitu from Niujiang Village, because he didn't want to take a detour, secretly passed through, and the \"Eldest Young Master\" saw him, saying that he had disturbed his afternoon nap, and immediately ordered four \"Little Ghosts\" to grab his legs and arms and start \"touring\" him. After \"touring\" him to the point of near-death, he was finally thrown more than ten feet away, causing Li Weitu's chest to rupture and his lungs to collapse, and he died. Li Xiaosi from Gaodu was beaten severely and thrown into the mud for taking shelter from a rainstorm in front of someone's door for a few minutes, and his belongings were confiscated. He climbed to Qilingdian with his injuries that night, hired someone to carry him home, spent three strings of six hundred coins, and sold his only three mu of land to get treatment. His father died of anger, and his family broke up! Ma Gadou from Zhonghou River was \"toured\" into a cripple due to a similar incident and became disabled. There are countless people who have been \"toured,\" and seventeen people have died from being \"toured\" alone.\n　　Chen Guiying, the daughter of old man Chen Huamin from East Gate, was fancied by the \"Eldest Young Master,\" who insisted on taking her as a concubine. The old man and his daughter were unwilling, so he sent the old man to the county government, detained him for half a month, and beat him half to death, finally giving the daughter to him. However, after only half a year, the daughter was thrown out, and she was not allowed to find a husband's family in Jincheng. In the end, she was forced to marry in Lucheng. The \"Third Young Master\" took a fancy to a seventeen-year-old girl named Da Yin, forcing her to marry his child. Yin felt that the family was too high-ranking and she couldn't match them, and his child was too young, so she was unwilling. The Third Young Master immediately sent her grandmother to the county government and detained her for seven days. Helpless, she also submitted with tears in her eyes. Liu Xiaofa, a young shop assistant, because he was clever and alert, was asked by the \"Third Young Master\" to be his attendant, but he was unwilling. The \"Third Young Master\" immediately notified his family: \"If Xiaofa doesn't come, your family will not have peace!\" Xiaofa's mother cried as she sent Xiaofa away, saying, \"Child! We can't afford to offend them! Go! Serve them well!\" Xiaofa lived in the Ma family for half a year and suffered countless grievances. Later, the \"Third Young Master\" asked him to buy Jindan pills. Xiaofa said, \"It's too tight these days, I'm afraid something will happen!\" The \"Third Young Master\" glared at him and said, \"If you don't go, I'll beat you to death! If something happens, just say you bought them for me, Third Young Master!\" Xiaofa was indeed caught and sent to the county government. The \"Third Young Master\" sent someone to threaten him, saying, \"You can't mention a single word about the Ma family, even if you're beaten to death! If you mention it, I'll take your head!\" Xiaofa was afraid, so he took the blame entirely on himself. He went through several trials, was beaten several times to the point of near-death, but never changed his story. Who knew that people don't eat wolves, but wolves eat people. Ma Jun, in order to protect his reputation as the chairman of the Anti-Drug Association, secretly ordered County Magistrate Zhang Honghui to find a way to shoot Xiaofa, \"to uphold the law.\"\n　　The dozens of maids and old women in the Ma family lived an even more inhuman life. Dan Maoshi served the \"Old Madam.\" Because she combed the Old Madam's hair and one strand fell out, she was beaten three or four times to the point of near death. Ma Funv looked after a child, and because the child cried once, she was beaten to the ground by the \"Old Madam\" with a horsewhip. She was also locked up and starved for two days and forced to kneel in a snowdrift for a day. She wasn't allowed to drink a drop of water for three days. Because the \"Old Madam\" was tired from beating Funv, Funv had to rub her legs and massage her back. Another maid was mistreated to the point of committing suicide by jumping into a urine pit.\n　　The masses recounted more than one hundred cases of murder and bloodshed caused by \"Ma Mansion\" and countless cases of beatings, \"touring,\" forced occupation, and extortion, causing grief and resentment. People were crying in the courtyards and rooms, crying at the meetings, and crying on the streets of East Gate. At the meeting on the 10th, Liu Xiaofa's mother cried until she passed out, and the wife of Hui person Guo Yahong cried until she died. Liu Zhanyuan and his child Liu Xiaosheng also cried themselves to death one after another. The masses shed the tears of brothers of the same fate, rescuing their brothers. When the rescued people, gasping for breath, shouted \"Revenge! Revenge!\" the masses' iron fists immediately and violently swung towards the Kings of Hell and the Judges.\n　　The democratic government, completely in accordance with the public will of the oppressed people, announced the confiscation of all the traitor Ma's property, compensation for the victims, the return of the more than three hundred rooms forcibly occupied from the masses, the three hundred mu of land and two thousand two hundred shi of grain extorted and plundered from the masses. The masses immediately shouted with wild joy, \"Long live the democratic government!\" \"Long live Chairman Mao!\" and bowed and saluted the huge statue of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in the center of the meeting place, vowing, \"We ordinary people will follow you to the end!\" Old man Chen Xihai, who was over seventy years old, squeezed to the front with his cane, bowed deeply, and said to himself, \"It's only right to kowtow to you!\"\n　　On the last day of the accusation movement—the afternoon of May 28th—the masses carried the spiritual tablets of more than one hundred wronged dead people who had been vindicated, along with six tables of sacrificial offerings, and held a grand funeral procession. At the front of the demonstration was a large horizontal plaque with the words \"Seek Justice and Avenge Wrongs,\" followed by the militia self-defense team carrying rifles and knives, and women and children all covered with white towels, waving various small flags. On them were written: \"The Ma family is a nest of turtles, drinking people's blood!\" \"The Ma family is a pack of wolves, hurting people every day!\" The Ma family's \"Kings of Hell\" and \"Judges,\" according to the orders of the masses, wore hemp and filial piety, carried mourning sticks, and shouted \"Father!\" \"Mother!\" while pulling the spirits. But this could not reduce the sadness of the relatives of the wronged dead. These relatives were carried on ten or so large carts, crying loudly all the way, and the entire demonstration procession shed tears upon hearing the sound. The group proceeded to the intersection of the city and held a sacrifice, then turned to South Gate and proceeded via Little Character Street and Horizontal Street, holding another sacrifice and a re-sacrifice. The entire urban and rural residents and villagers who came to town participated. The streets, five or six zhang wide, were filled with a dark mass of people, shrouded in the sound of bitter tears and sobs. An old man wiped away his tears and snot and said, \"Fresh blood accumulates into a thousand years of hatred, when will this revenge be repaid? There are more than just these one hundred people killed by Ma Jun! Not to mention Shanxi Province, but in Jincheng County alone, they are countless!\"\n　　When the procession finally arrived at the South Teaching Field to hold the \"Spirit Burning,\" even more sacrificers gathered. The sound of drums and music, the sound of crying, and the slogans of seeking justice and revenge, mixed into a deafening roar that shook the mountains.

    "content": "【Report from this newspaper in Weixian】After the liberation of Yongzhi County, the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Districts successively carried out rent reduction, interest reduction, capital increase, and land redemption movements. In the five districts of the county, two-thirds of the villages have established workers and peasants associations and sub-district representative assemblies. However, the failure to promptly launch an anti-traitor movement to further develop and consolidate the unity of the middle and poor peasants resulted in the long-term isolation of hired laborers and poor peasants, while landlords and stubborn elements seized the opportunity to launch widespread counterattacks. After more than one hundred cadres from the District Committee's Land Reform Work Team arrived in Yongzhi, their month-long efforts completely changed this situation. Out of the county's two hundred and fifty-six villages, more than one hundred large villages have been mobilized, and more than three hundred households of local tyrants, landlords, and traitors have been liquidated. The masses participating in the liquidation account for ninety percent of the total number of households. Farmers in most villages have obtained land, houses, and property. Farmers in Tianzhuang Village in the Third District received at least three mu of land and 80,000 yuan in property per person. The breakthrough was primarily due to the control of local armed forces, the implementation of traitor elimination and anti-espionage measures, the suppression of secret agent assassinations, and the removal of fear among the masses and cadres. In the anti-espionage movement in the Third District, three gangs of \"political bandits\" were eliminated. The assassination cases in Fengzhuang, Luzhuang, Wangfangzi and other villages have all been solved.\n\n【Report from this newspaper】After the Land Reform Work Teams in Southern Hebei went to the countryside, they worked closely with local leaders according to the local situation, formed groups to go to the countryside to conduct investigations and research, and organized the masses to carry out land reform in a planned manner. After investigation and research in Ningnan, based on the actual situation in each region and the demands of the masses, the masses were mobilized again. According to statistics, there are sixty villages in the county that need to be further mobilized (including seventeen that have not been mobilized at all). The one hundred and twenty members of the Land Reform Work Team are divided into work groups and assigned to various districts, under the unified leadership of the original district. Each group has a key village to create experience. A base company is transferred from the county and assigned to various districts to suppress secret agents and support the masses. Specific methods: first investigate and study the rural class relations and existing problems. Then, start from organizing the masses to pour out their bitterness, holding \"thinking meetings\" to find the root causes of poverty, and enlighten the masses to rise up in struggle. More than fifty members of the Northern University Land Reform Work Team arrived in Nanhe in early August and have now been divided into five groups to cooperate with local cadres to go to the countryside and mobilize the masses to carry out land reform.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 永智反奸清算运动展开  三百多地主恶霸低头　三区田庄村每人平均得地三亩南和宁南翻身运动正开展中\n\n1946-08-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　永智反奸清算运动展开\n　　三百多地主恶霸低头\n    三区田庄村每人平均得地三亩南和宁南翻身运动正开展中\n    【本报威县讯】永智县解放后，二、三、四、五区相继进行了减租减息增资赎地运动。全县五个区已有三分之二的村庄建立了工农会和小区代表会。但未迅速开展反奸运动，进一步发展与巩固中贫农的团结，故使雇佃贫长期孤立，而地主封顽趁机普遍反攻。地委翻身队百余干部到永智后，经过一月努力，完全改变了这一局面。全县二百五十六村，已发动起来一百多个大村，清算了三百多户恶霸地主和汉奸，参加清算的群众，占总户数百分之九十，多数村庄农民获得了土地房屋和资财。三区田庄农民，每人起码得到土地三亩，资财八万元。局面的打开首先是由于掌握地方武装，实行除奸反特，镇压特务暗杀，解除群众与干部的恐惧。三区在反特运动中，消灭了三股“政治土匪”。冯庄、芦庄、王坊子等村暗杀案件，均被破获。\n    【本报讯】冀南各地翻身队下乡后，根据当地情况，与当地领导密切配合，分组下乡进行调查研究，有计划的组织群众翻身。宁南经调查研究，根据各地区的实际情形和群众要求，重新放手发动群众。据统计全县需要继续发动的村庄有六十个，（内有根本未发动者十七个）翻身队一百二十人编为工作组，分配各区，由原区统一领导。各小组有一个重点村创造经验。由县抽调一个基干连，分配各区镇压特务，给群众撑腰。具体作法：先调查研究农村阶级关系和现有的问题。再从组织倒苦水，开“想想会”找穷根启发群众的觉悟，引导其起来斗争。北方大学翻身队五十余人八月初到达南和，现已划为五个小组，配合本地干部分头下乡，普遍发动群众翻身。"

Shanghai Wenhui Daily reporter Zhao Zecheng and Zhenbao reporter Li Chunyi visited Pengjiashigou, Liangdian, Yanbin and other villages and towns in the Binhai Liberated Area on July 25th. They spoke highly of the happy life of the people in the liberated area, who were developing their production, becoming wealthy, well-fed, and enjoying democracy and freedom. When the two reporters witnessed the young children in the literacy class and the women in the literacy group in Pengjiashigou diligently studying, each having already learned 500 to 1,000 characters, and the teachers leading the students in practical teaching of cotton cultivation in their spare time, they considered it one of the best methods of popularizing education and applying what is learned. The two reporters paid particular attention to the fact that the farmers in Dongyan Village automatically held meetings to arrange production and discuss how to help military families, and praised it as a concrete manifestation of the people's enthusiasm after they had turned over economically. Zhao said with emotion: \"In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, there are no such meetings at all, because the people there do not have a democratic government elected by themselves.\" When he went to Village × to visit the masses' production, he saw that the crops along the way were particularly luxuriant. After the farmers introduced that the village had realized \"the tillers have their land\", and implemented mutual aid by exchanging labor to save labor and increase production, the two reporters praised this method of planned use of labor to organize production. One day, the two reporters went to Dalvqian Village to interview the labor hero Zheng Xin. They inquired in detail about Zheng Xin's journey from starting a wasteland reclamation to becoming a wealthy middle peasant owning more than 30 mu of land, earning two and saving one this year, and being elected as a labor hero and receiving the government's award of耕牛 (draft cattle), agricultural tools, etc. That evening, they also attended the village's literacy class and saw a meeting where everyone checked their production plans and reviewed their labor concepts. They were amazed by the enthusiastic and orderly speeches of the rural women at the meeting, and said that although the mountains and rivers remained the same, the people's thinking and social atmosphere were world apart compared to the past. Based on their observations in various places, the two reporters expressed their impressions, saying: \"The people in the liberated areas have developed democratic living habits. Seeing is believing, and the impression now is a thousand times better than what I heard about the liberated areas before. Visiting and understanding the democratic construction of the liberated areas has increased our confidence in winning peace and democracy.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪文汇报真报记者  盛赞我莒县农村建设  他们说：眼见比耳闻好千百倍，参观后增加了我们争取和平民主的信心。\n\n1946-08-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪文汇报真报记者\n　　盛赞我莒县农村建设\n　　他们说：眼见比耳闻好千百倍，参观后增加了我们争取和平民主的信心。\n    【新华社临沂十七日电】沪文汇报记者赵则诚、真报记者李纯一两氏，于上月二十五日来滨海解放区参观莒县彭家仕沟、良店、筵宾等村镇，对解放区人民生产发家、丰衣足食、民主自由的幸福生活，备加赞扬。当两氏目睹彭家仕沟青年儿童识字班妇女识字组学员，均努力学习，每人已识五百至一千字，教员在课余领导学生修棉的实用教学，他们认为是普及教育与学以致用的最好方法之一。两氏对东筵村农民自动开会布置生产，并讨论如何帮助军属等问题尤为注意，誉之为人民在经济上翻身后热情的具体表现。赵氏感慨地说：“在国民党统治区，根本没有这样的会，因为那里老百姓没有自己选举的民主政府。”当他到×村参观群众生产时，见沿途庄禾特别茂盛，经农民介绍该村已实现“耕者有其田”，且实行变工互助、以节省劳力提高产量等情后，两氏对此种有计划运用劳力组织生产的办法，颇为称赞。一日两氏继赴大履前村访问劳动英雄郑信，对郑信由开荒起家现已成为拥有土地三十余亩之富裕中农，今年已走到耕二余一及当选为劳动英雄后获得政府奖予耕牛、农具等的经过，询问甚详。是晚复参加该村识字班，见各人检查生产计划、检讨劳动观念的会议，对农村妇女在会上踊跃而有条理的发言甚为惊异，咸谓山川依旧而人民思想及社会风气，今昔相较已有天壤之别。两氏以各地观察所得，发表印象称：“解放区人民，已养成民主生活习惯，百闻不如一见，此刻印象较诸以前所听到的解放区，要好千百倍。参观了解放区民主建设后，增加了我们争取和平民主的胜利信心。”"

    "content": "Taking Care of Industry and Commerce, Understanding the Characteristics of Citizens\n　　The Mass Movement in Linqing City is Large-Scale\n    [Our paper's dispatch from Weixian] Since the 7th, Linqing City has launched a large-scale anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement, overthrowing Su Ziming, the head of the puppet North China Business Office who recognized the enemy as his father and squeezed merchants and civilians, and Ji Xiaofan, the feudal evil landlord who ruled and squeezed the masses for many years. The citizens recovered losses of 16 million yuan. More than 3,600 citizens participated in mass organizations during the movement, and the following experiences were gained:\n    (1) Understand the characteristics of citizens and grasp their demands. The occupations of urban civilians are very scattered and complex, and their suffering is diverse. For example, the 114 households in Taoyuan Street who participated in mass organizations include the extremely poor, the poor, vendors, small merchants, large cart drivers, mud workers, shoemakers, small shop assistants, long-term and short-term workers, church servants, and other types of people. They have suffered significant rule and oppression from the Kuomintang government, Japanese invaders, traitors and puppets, and evil landlords. Their lives are extremely poor, and they struggle to find their next meal. We must carefully investigate and research, deeply discover their suffering, and boldly let them rise up. During the movement, take care of their living difficulties, hold fewer large meetings, utilize evening meetings, and provide economic assistance.\n    (2) There were a particularly large number of traitors and puppets in Linqing City in the past, but most of them were civilians forced by life. Therefore, in addition to severely punishing a small number of heinous, die-hard big traitors and evil bullies, most were educated to repent and rehabilitate themselves. During this movement, the first few people were moved by our education, frankly confessed their sins, and obtained the leniency of the masses, restoring their civil rights. Under their influence, more than 20 people immediately reformed, and some have already found suitable jobs.\n    (3) In the anti-traitor liquidation movement, the interests of industry and commerce were taken into account, dispelling the doubts of merchants. The merchants saw clearly that the struggle was against big traitors and evil bullies, breaking the concerns of not daring to let go of business in the past due to listening to rumors from secret agents. The boss of Senji Tea Shop recently took a trip to Tianjin, and his capital of 100,000 yuan earned a profit of 110,000 yuan. He regretted and said, \"In the past, I suffered from not believing in the policy. If I had done this earlier, several million yuan would have been in my hands!\" Therefore, he has changed from passive observation in the past to active business. (Xiang Ming)\n    [Another dispatch] The anti-traitor anger of the Third District of Linqing, with more than 80 villages jointly struggling against the puppet district chief Qin Muxuan, puppet message deliverer Huang Zhenhe, and Huang Dechang, etc., fired the first shot of victory, and it is burning vigorously and universally everywhere. Within a month, not counting struggles within the scope of one village, 34 villages jointly struggled against traitors Zhang Meng and Zhang Zhonglin; 20 villages jointly struggled against enemy agent Song Changze; 17 villages jointly struggled against Song Changyou and Zhao Tingdong, company commanders of the puppet bandit Wu Lianjie's unit. The remaining 10 or 8 villages jointly overthrew puppet township chiefs Zhao Shuchen, He Ganheng, etc. Finally, they concentrated their efforts to attack the famous five major feudal fortresses: Siwa, Aoli, Suizhuang, Fangzhi, and Wu Liuzhuang. They destroyed the stubborn puppet feudal rule, uncovered the Kuomintang secret agents' sabotage conspiracy, liquidated the spoils looted by the traitors and stubborn elements, redressed the grievances accumulated by the masses for many years, and transformed the regimes of more than 60 villages. At present, this movement is nearing its end, and the villages are organizing and distributing the fruits of victory. More than 30 villages have already turned to the great production movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 照顾工商业认识市民特点  临清市群运规模宏大\n向明\n1946-08-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　照顾工商业认识市民特点\n　　临清市群运规模宏大\n    【本报威县讯】七日以来，临清市展开大规模的反奸诉苦运动，斗垮了认贼作父压榨商民的伪华北营业所主任苏子明，及统治压榨群众多年的封建恶霸地主冀筱帆，市民们追回损失款一千六百万元，运动中有三千六百多市民参加了群众组织，并获得几点经验如下：\n    （一）认识市民的特点，抓住其要求。城市平民的行业非常分散复杂，痛苦是多种多样的。如桃园街参加群众组织的一百一十四户中，即包括赤贫、贫民、摊贩、小商人、大把车子、泥工、鞋匠、小店员、长短工、礼拜堂佣人等多种人。他们身受过国民党政府、日寇、奸伪及恶霸地主的重要统治压榨，生活穷困不堪，吃了上顿找下顿，我们要仔细调查研究，深入发现他们的痛苦，大胆让他们起来。在运动过程中照顾其生活困难，少开大会，利用晚上开会和经济上帮助等。\n    （二）临清市过去的奸伪人员特别多，但大部分都是为生活所迫的平民。因而除对少数罪大恶极、死心塌地的大汉奸恶霸予以严惩外，一般的都教育其悔过自新。这次运动时，首先几个人为我教育所感动，坦白悔过取得了群众的宽大，恢复了公民权，在他们的影响下立即有二十多个自新了，并有的已找到适当职业。\n    （三）在反奸清算运动中，照顾了工商业利益，打破了商人的疑虑。商人们看清了斗争的是大汉奸、恶霸，打破了过去由于听了特务造谣而不敢放手营业的顾虑。森记茶店老板，最近去天津跑了一趟，十万元本钱即赚了十一万利，他后悔的说：“过去吃了不相信政策的亏，如早这样作，几百万元已经到了手了！”所以他从过去的消极观望转为积极营业。（向明）\n    【又讯】临清三区的反奸怒火，以八十余村联合斗争伪区长秦睦轩、伪传达长黄镇河及黄德昌等，打响了胜利的第一炮，并在各地轰轰烈烈地普遍燃烧起来。一月内，除一村范围的斗争不计外，有三十四村联合斗争汉奸张猛、张仲林；二十村联合斗争敌特宋长泽；十七村联合斗争伪匪吴连杰部连长宋长友、赵廷栋。其余十村八村联合斗倒的，有伪大乡长赵梳臣、何干亨等。最后并集中力量，攻下著名的五大封建堡垒：司洼、凹里、随庄、方治与吴刘庄。摧毁了顽伪封建统治，破获了国民党特务的破坏阴谋，清算了奸顽们所掠赃物，申雪了群众多年积冤，改造了六十多村政权。目下这一运动已近结束，各村正整理组织，分配果实。并已有三十余村转入大生产运动。"

This marks the first large-scale modernized water conservancy construction in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region. The canal originates at the Diaoyutai Ditch Bank in the Fourth District of Quyang, meandering for more than ten *li* between the mountains of Mushan and Huishan, then running east, cutting through the Yuan Tan Mountain, a mass of chaotic rocks, and flowing straight into the main canal of the Mengliang River. The canal is 85 *li* long, and its branch canals are as dense as spider webs, spreading across the fields. The completed main and branch canals are already able to release water, irrigating a total area of over 40,000 *mu*. The downstream project is expected to be completed by next spring, with the benefited land increasing to over 30,000 *mu*. As early as the 14th year of the Republic of China, the people of Quyang, suffering from drought, had proposed using the Shahe River's water flow for irrigation, but were stymied by the long distance. After the Anti-Japanese War, with the assistance of the democratic government, construction began in the spring of the 28th year amidst frequent warfare. At that time, thousands of laborers participated daily, and all county and district cadres implemented a full-day work assistance system. Construction was interrupted by Japanese invaders, but the construction of dangerous upstream sections was completed within half a year. In October of that year, the Fourth District of Quyang was subjected to a \"nibbling\" campaign by the Japanese invaders, but canal construction continued in some areas. After the victory of the anti-\"nibbling\" struggle in the 32nd year, the democratic government provided substantial financial assistance, and construction was continued in sections throughout the county, with earth excavation alone requiring over 500,000 workdays. In order to commemorate General Nie Rongzhen's outstanding contributions to leading and creating the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area, the masses unanimously requested that the canal be named the Rongzhen Canal.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 3rd] The people of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area have successfully completed the massive water conservancy construction project for the first half of this year, adding and restoring 4,229,444 *mu* of irrigated land. According to incomplete statistics from the Jizhong, Jidong, Jinji, and Chahar districts, a total of 557 canals were repaired, 1,061,103 *mu* of land were irrigated, 122 dikes were built (not including the 236 *li* of new dikes in Jizhong), protecting 133,092 *mu* of farmland, and 20 new rivers over 80 *li* long were opened. 2,553,296 *mu* of land were protected and drained from waterlogging, 32 beaches were repaired, and 26,733 *mu* of good farmland were added. According to statistics, the water conservancy projects built in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War can irrigate and protect a total land area of 13,023,537 *mu*. Although the first half of this year encountered severe difficulties such as a lack of construction materials and frequent sabotage and obstruction by Chiang's puppet troops, water conservancy construction was completed, amounting to about one-third of all projects during the Anti-Japanese War.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 现代化巨大水利建筑  曲阳荣臻渠落成  晋察冀半年水利建设增水田四百余万亩\n\n1946-08-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　现代化巨大水利建筑\n　　曲阳荣臻渠落成\n　　晋察冀半年水利建设增水田四百余万亩\n    【新华社阜平十五日电】兴修已五度塞暑的曲阳荣臻渠，主要工程部分，于今夏七月落成，此为晋察冀边区内地首次出现的浩大近代化水利建筑。该渠溯源于曲阳四区钓鱼台大沟畔，自穆山麾山山麓间回烧穿行凡十数里，然后东向凿通乱石垒垒的元坦山长流直泻归入孟良河干渠。该渠全长达八十五里，支渠更稠如蛛网，四布于田垄间，全部竣工的干渠支渠，业已先可放水，灌溉面积共四万余亩。下游工程可望于明春竣工，受惠土地可增至三万余亩。溯自民国十四年初，曲阳人民苦旱，曾有利用沙河水流灌溉的提议，困困于路程遥远未果。抗战后经民主政府扶助，于二十八年春在频繁的战争间隙中开始动工，当时每日都有数千民工参加，全县县区干部亦实行整日助工制。中间曾经过日寇阻扰，但仍于半年内完成上游险工多处。是年十月曲阳四区遭日寇“蚕食”，但部分地区的开渠工程，仍在进行。卅二年反“蚕食”斗争胜利后，民主政府以巨额资金扶助，在全县分段续修，仅挖土工程即用工五十余万个。群众为纪念聂荣臻将军领导创造晋察冀解放区的卓越功勋，一致请求命名该渠为荣臻渠。\n    【新华社张家口三日电】晋察冀解放区人民，业已胜利完成本年前半年度巨大的水利建设工程，新增及恢复水田四百廿九万四千二百四十四亩。据冀中、冀东、冀晋、察哈尔等区不完全统计，共修整渠道五百五十七条，浇地一百零六万一千一百零三亩，修筑堤坝一百廿二道（不包括冀中新坝二百三十六里在内）护田十三万三千零九十二亩，开辟长八十余里的新河廿道。屏护及脱出水浸地二百五十五万三千二百九十六亩，修滩三十二处，增加良田二万六千七百三十三亩。按晋察冀边区在抗战八年中兴修之水利，可灌溉及屏护土地面积共达一千三百零二万三千五百三十七亩。今年上半年虽遇建筑器材缺乏，蒋伪军频繁的破坏阻挠等严重困难，却完成了约合抗战中全部工程三分之一左右的水利建设。"

On the night of the 11th, they attacked the Southern Gate of Kaifeng and the airport, the center of Liu Zhi's civil war command, capturing more than ten defending soldiers. The whole city of Kaifeng was shaken and placed under emergency curfew. On the night of the 13th, they also occupied Zhuxian Town, an important town more than 30 miles south of Kaifeng, capturing two Chiang soldiers, wounding three, and seizing five rifles, with no casualties on our side. On the same day, our armed work team captured more than ten advancing cars and horse-drawn carts on the Kaifeng-Zhuxian Town road, seizing a large amount of supplies. The Chiang troops are panic-stricken by the elusive and surprise attacks of our guerrillas and militiamen.\n[Our Newspaper Handan, 19th Dispatch] Young and strong men in the border region have voluntarily enlisted in the army and rushed to the front lines to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. In the past ten days, the Ji-Lu-Yu area has reached more than 20,000 people, while the Taihang area has reached 12,000 people.\n　　Since the anti-civil war conference was held in Yuncheng, Ji-Lu-Yu, the masses have automatically launched a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army. In Xiao and Liang Zhuang alone, 11 model squad members collectively enlisted in the army. 183 demobilized soldiers in Junan County returned to the front line. In Yutai County's Chengguan District, after hearing the news of the Chiang troops' offensive against the border region, 12 young people enlisted and 17 soldiers returned to their units within half a day. 3,000 people in the whole district formed teams to send off the new soldiers. Bu Xianhui's father said when he sent his son to the front line: \"We only turned ourselves around since the Communist Party came. Chiang Kai-shek wants to come and fight again, we have to fight him to the death.\" Young woman Wei Yulian said: \"If the government calls, I will also take a gun to the front.\" Mr. Zhou, from Li Tang Village, Haozhai District, Peixian County, sent his eldest son to the Old Ninth Regiment on the first day that the Chiang troops began their offensive against the Eastern Henan District, and after the victory of the Longhai Campaign, he sent his second son to the main force. When Yang Xianting sent his son to join the army, he said: \"Fight to the end, don't come home until you defeat the reactionaries.\" The chairman of the Farmers' Association of Wanglou, the village head of Liwa House, and the militia captain of Xuge all led the masses to join the army.\n　　In Wu'an Chengguan, 47 heroes signed up for the army in two days. Li Heixiao and Yin Renxiao, Communist Party members in Neiqiu, took the lead in signing up and led 288 people to join the People's Liberation Army. In Changzhi, 120 people signed up in the first district and more than 300 people signed up in the third district in two days. Mothers sending off their sons, wives sending off their husbands, lanterns and decorations everywhere, celebrating and sending off the brave men who voluntarily enlisted in the army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫东民众武装配合陇海反攻  一度袭入开封南关　全城震动蒋军恐慌万状  坚决保卫边区三万青壮自动投军\n\n1946-08-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫东民众武装配合陇海反攻\n　　一度袭入开封南关\n　　全城震动蒋军恐慌万状\n　　坚决保卫边区三万青壮自动投军\n    【本报荷泽十八日电】我豫东分区民众武装日来配合我在兰封、民权、砀山、杞县一线反攻作战，积极进行游击运动。十一日夜袭刘峙内战指挥中心开封南关及飞机场，俘获十余名守军，开封全城震动，紧急戒严。十三日夜又占领开封南三十余里之重镇——朱仙镇，俘蒋军士兵二，伤三，缴步枪五枝，我无伤亡。同日我武工队在开封朱仙镇道上，俘获进犯之汽车与马车十余辆，缴获辎重甚多。蒋军对我游击队民兵神出鬼没的奇袭奔袭恐慌万状。\n    【本报邯郸十九日电】边区青壮年纷纷自动投军，奔赴前线，粉碎蒋介石的进攻。旬日以来，冀鲁豫区已达两万人以上，太行则已达一万二千人。\n    冀鲁豫郓城自举行反内战大会后，即由群众自动掀起参军热潮，仅萧、梁二庄即有十一名模范班员集体参军，巨南县一百八十三名复员战士再上前线，鱼台县城关区自听到蒋军进攻边区消息后，半天内即有十二个青年参军，十七个战士归队，全区三千群众结队欢送新战士。卜宪惠的父亲送他的儿子上前线时说：“自从共产党来了咱才翻了身，蒋介石又想来打，咱死也得和他拚。”青年妇女魏玉莲说：“要是政府有号召，我也拿枪上前方。”沛县郝寨区李堂村周老先生，在蒋军开始进攻豫东区第一天就送他大儿参加了老九团，陇海战役胜利后，又送他二儿子到主力军去了。杨仙廷送他儿子参军时说：“要干到底，不打垮反动派不要回家。”王楼的农会会长，李瓦屋的村长，徐阁的民兵队长都带领着群众参军。\n    武安城关在两天内即有四十七名好汉，报名参军。内邱共产党员李黑小、尹仁小首先报名，带领了二百八十八名参加了子弟兵。长治一区两天内有一百二十人，三区两天内即有三百余名报名参军。母亲送儿、妻子送郎，到处张灯结彩，欢送自动投军的勇士。"

On the 13th, Congress Party President Nehru wrote to Muslim League President Jinnah, requesting the Muslim League to cooperate in forming an interim government. On the 15th, Nehru personally visited Jinnah to discuss the issue of inviting the Muslim League to join the interim government. It is reported that the discussion yielded no results. The Congress Party has drafted two cabinet lists, one including representatives of the Muslim League, and the other without. So far, there is no indication that the Muslim League will participate in the interim government. The Congress Party revealed that it will establish the interim government within the week, regardless of whether the Muslim League participates or not. It is reported that in the proposed interim government, Nehru will serve as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The British plan for the Indian interim government has changed several times. The first plan was rejected by the Congress Party on June 14 because it stipulated that the Congress Party and the Muslim League should be in an equal position in the interim government. The second plan stipulated that the ratio between the Congress Party and the Muslim League in the government should be six to five, which was also rejected by the Congress Party. The Muslim League believed that Britain had violated its promise to give the Congress Party and the Muslim League equal status in the interim government, and rejected the British plan for India on July 28.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 魏菲尔已授权国大党  组织印度临时政府  尼赫鲁致函金纳要求回盟合作\n\n1946-08-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　魏菲尔已授权国大党\n　  组织印度临时政府\n    尼赫鲁致函金纳要求回盟合作\n    【新华社延安十六日电】综合报导：印回教同盟拒绝英国对印计划后，印督魏菲尔已于十日授权国大党组织印度临时政府，并要国大党继续与回盟谈判。十三日国大党主席尼赫鲁致函回盟主席金纳，要求回盟合作共组临时政府。十五日尼赫鲁并亲访金纳，讨论邀请回盟加入临时政府问题。据悉，讨论无何结果。国大党已拟就两个内阁名单，其一包括有回盟代表，另一则没有。迄今为止，仍未有回盟将参加临时政府的迹象。国大党方面透露，国大党将于周内成立临时政府，不管回盟参加与否。据悉拟议中的临时政府，尼赫鲁将任总理兼外长。按英国对印临时政府的计划曾数度改变，首次计划因规定国大党与回盟在临时政府中处于平等地位而于六月十四日被国大党拒绝，第二次计划规定国大与回盟在政府中为六与五之比，亦为国大党拒绝，回盟则认为英国违背了在临时政府中予国回处于平等地位的诺言，而于七月二十八日拒绝了英国对印计划。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: A report from Shanghai: The \"Weekly Review,\" issue 47, published here at the end of July, carried an article by Fan Hui entitled \"Four Stages of American Policy Towards China,\" analyzing the US policy towards China after Marshall was appointed US Special Envoy to China. It said: \"The main focus of the US policy towards China in this stage was to limit the military situation within the pass to a certain foundation, while on the other hand, condoning and helping the Kuomintang and its government to develop towards outside the pass.\"\n\nFan said: In order to implement this policy, Marshall urged the Kuomintang and its government to convene the Political Consultative Conference and issued a ceasefire order, but specifically excluded the Northeast. During this period, US naval vessels were used to transport the Kuomintang's US-equipped troops to the Northeast. Furthermore, US Marines constantly guarded the only supply line from Beiping to outside the pass for the Kuomintang – the Beining Railway. When these political and military deployments were completed, Marshall suddenly flew back to the United States. Then, the Kuomintang government launched anti-Soviet movements in Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, Tianjin and other places, and the US State Department also issued statements in a timely manner, echoing each other. Until the Soviet army announced its withdrawal from the Northeast, Marshall returned to China. At that time, during the tense and fierce Northeast War, Marshall \"adopted a hands-off attitude,\" and focused on \"intensifying assistance in transporting Kuomintang troops to reinforce the Northeast\" and \"making every effort to suppress the spread of the war outside the pass to inside the pass.\" It was not until the 184th Division launched an anti-civil war uprising and the Kuomintang army attacking Harbin was contained that \"this old general resumed his activities and became active again.\" Fan stated that the outbreak of the wars in the Central Plains, Northern Jiangsu, and Southern Shanxi was the result of the US policy condoning the Kuomintang reactionaries' expansion of the civil war.\n\nIt also exposed the false face of American \"mediation,\" saying: When Xuanhua Store was in imminent danger, Marshall did not say a word, but when Li Xiannian's army broke through to the west and might enter Sichuan and Shaanxi, Marshall hurriedly sent an executive group to mediate and stop them. Marshall would not speak out if a Communist base area was cut off, but if it took too much time to cut off this base area, or if it caused other problems, or if it caused the Kuomintang to suffer losses, then Marshall would immediately \"mediate.\" \"We should also view the ongoing Northern Jiangsu war in the same way.\" The author pointed out the current state of the Kuomintang, which does not declare the existence of a full-scale civil war, but in essence fights in this regionally separated state, saying: \"If the Kuomintang fights well, then the United States may simply let it continue to fight; if it does not fight well, the United States will immediately come out to mediate.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海“周报”评美对华政策  调停其名助蒋其实  马歇尔是这个政策的执行人\n\n1946-08-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海“周报”评美对华政策\n　  调停其名助蒋其实\n　　马歇尔是这个政策的执行人\n    【新华社延安十九日电】沪讯：此间七月底出版之“周报”四十七期载范蕙作“美国对华政策的四个阶段”一文，分析马歇尔受任美驻华特使后的美国对华政策说：“这一阶段的美国对华政策，主要的是想把关内的军事形势限制在一定的基础之上，而在另一方面则纵容并且帮助国民党及其政府向关外发展”。范氏说：马歇尔为了执行这个政策，所以督促国民党及其政府召开了政治协商会议，并颁布了停战命令，但是特别把东北除外，且在此期间，用美海军舰船运送国民党美械化部队去东北，更不断以美海军陆战队为国民党守卫从北平到关外唯一补给线——北宁路。当这些政治军事部署完成、马歇尔突飞返美国，接着国民党政府即发动沪渝平津各地的反苏运动，美国务院亦适时发表声明，互相呼应。迄苏军宣布自东北撤退，马歇尔就回到中国，当时紧张激烈的东北战争，马歇尔“却采取袖手旁观的态度”，而专心致力于“加紧帮助运送国民党军增援东北”和“竭力压制防止关外的战火蔓延及于关内”。直到一八四师举行反内战起义，向哈尔滨进攻的国民党军被遏阻，“这位老将军才又恢复活动，重新积极起来”。范氏陈述中原、苏北和晋南战事的爆发，即美国政策纵容国民党反动派扩大内战所致。并揭露美国“调停”的假面目称：当宣化店岌岌可危之时，马歇尔没有说一句话，但当李先念军突围西进，可能入川入陕之际，马歇尔赶忙派执行小组来调处阻止了。割掉一块中共基地，马歇尔不会出面说话，但倘若因割这块基地而花了太多的时间，或会引起别的问题，或会叫国民党反而吃亏，那马歇尔是立刻便要“调停”的。对正在开展中的苏北战争，我们也当作如是观”。作者指出目前国民党里面不宣布全面内战的存在，而骨子里却这样地区分别的打的状态说：“国民党打的好，那美国就可能索性让它打下去；打得不好，美国是会马上出来调停的”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th—The Joint Conference of Representatives from Northeast Provinces enthusiastically discussed the Common Governance Program of the democratic governments of Northeast provinces and cities on the 9th, 10th, and 11th. This program was originally proposed by Lin Feng, Lü Zhengfeng, Gao Chongmin, Zhang Xuesi, Che Xiangchen, and others, and co-signed by 146 representatives including Wang Huanwen, Yu Tianfang, and Wan Yi. It was presented to the general assembly on the third day (9th), with detailed explanations by the original proposers Lin Feng and Gao Chongmin. On the fourth day, various delegation held separate deliberations. On the fifth day, a plenary session was convened for discussion.\n\nPrior to the discussion, Mr. Yu Yifu, representing the Proposal Review Committee of the conference, reported on the proposal review process, stating: \"All proposals from the representatives of the conference totaled 108, which were consolidated into 55: 9 on politics, 16 on civil affairs, 5 on military affairs, 14 on education, 7 on finance and economics, 1 on transportation, 2 on ethnic affairs, and 1 on the governance program.\" Subsequently, the conference focused on discussing the governance program.\n\nRepresentatives spoke enthusiastically, focusing primarily on land, military, cultural and educational affairs, and religious and ethnic minority issues within the program. The land issue sparked the most heated debate, with over 80 representatives speaking. While all representatives agreed on the principle of realizing \"land to the tiller,\" the focus of contention was whether the program should include a clause on \"distributing the land of large landlords.\"\n\nFarmer representative Qiao Chuanyi stated: \"Land to the tiller is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition. Today, we are distributing the land of traitors, bandits, despots, and reactionaries. To take care of the lives of landlords and their families, those who have not acted as despots will still be allowed to cultivate some land.\" Other representatives added that in the Northeast, many large landlords were inseparable from traitors and bandits, and their land should be distributed. However, landlords who participated in the War of Resistance against Japan and the democratic movement should be taken care of. Regarding the land issue of Mongolians, some representatives suggested that it should be stipulated in the provincial constitutions of each province based on specific circumstances. Mr. Cha Ansun, Vice-Chairman of the Qiqihar City Council, said: \"We must improve the lives of Mongolians and transform nomadic peoples into cultivators, so the land issue of Mongolians should be resolved.\" However, Mongolian representatives pointed out that in Jilin Province, 170,000 hectares of land were held by 30,000 Mongolians, and Mongolians could not bear to see Han compatriots without land, so a portion could be distributed.\n\nDuring discussions on religious and ethnic issues, some representatives argued that Koreans who had acquired citizenship should be treated the same as domestic ethnic minorities. Mr. Guan Houyan explained that Koreans had made significant contributions in the War of Resistance against Japan and the democratic struggle, and many Korean compatriots in the Anti-Japanese United Army had fought bravely against Japan for many years.\n\nAfter three days of detailed discussion, this general guideline for building a new, democratic, and prosperous Northeast was formally adopted with the unanimous support of all representatives.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北各省代表联席会　通过民主施政纲领  对实现“耕者有其田”曾热烈讨论\n\n1946-08-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北各省代表联席会\n　  通过民主施政纲领\n　　对实现“耕者有其田”曾热烈讨论\n    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】东北各省代表联席会于九、十、十一三日热烈讨论东北各省市民主政府共同施政纲领。该纲领原由林枫、吕正峰、高崇民、张学思、车向忱等十人提出，王焕文、于天放、万毅等一百四十六位代表联署，于第三日（九日）大会提出，并由原提案人林枫、高崇民详加说明，大会第四日由各代表团分别进行酝酿，第五日即召开全体大会讨论。讨论前，于毅夫氏代表大会提案审查委员会报告提案审查经过称：大会各代表之全部提案共一○八件，经综合归并后共五十五件，计政治九件，民政十六件，军事五件，教育十四件，财经七件，交通一件，民族二件，施政纲领一件。继大会集中力量讨论施政纲领。各代表热烈发言，多集中于纲领中之土地、军事、文教及宗教、少数民族问题。尤以土地问题讨论最为热烈，共有八十几位代表发言，对实现“耕者有其田”的原则，各代表俱无异议，争论之焦点，在于纲领中应否规定“分配大地主土地”一项问题上。农民代表乔传义发言称：“耕者有其田是孙中山先生的主张，我们今天分的是汉奸、土匪、恶霸、反动派的土地，为了照顾地主的生活及其家属，没作恶霸的还留给他一部分土地耕种”。其他代表补充说明东北不少大地主和汉奸、胡子不可分，这些人的土地要分，但对参加抗日和民主运动的地主，应加以照顾。关于蒙民土地问题，一部分代表主张根据特殊情况，由各省的省宪中加以规定。齐齐哈尔市议会副议长查安荪先生说：“我们要提高蒙民生活，要使游牧民族变成耕种者，故蒙民土地问题应当解决”。而蒙民代表则提出吉林省有十七万垧土地在三万蒙人手中，蒙胞不能看着汉胞没土地，所以可以分出一部分。在讨论宗教、民族问题时，一部分代表主张对入籍之韩人，应与国内的少数民族同等看待。关后彦老先生说明韩人在抗日和民主斗争中都有不少功绩，抗联中曾有不少韩胞对日苦战多年。经过三天的详细讨论，这一建设民主繁荣新东北的总指针，在全体代表一致拥护下正式通过。"

    "content": "Taiyue Communications\n\n　　Ten Minutes of Battle　　　　　　　Taiyue Communications\n    On the night of the 13th, after our army recovered Dangma Village, two platoons of the Fifth Company chased the KMT troops of the First Company all the way to Zhu Village. The stubborn enemy set up a machine gun on the east gate tower of Zhu Village, firing wildly at the two platoons. However, our Deputy Company Commander Huang Jianli, braving the rain of bullets, charged heroically and drove the enemy into the village with four grenades in a row. We didn't stop and attacked straight into the village, occupying four courtyards. The stubborn enemy inside the village panicked and hastily started up mountain guns, infantry guns, mortars, and machine guns mounted on trees. Immediately, all kinds of sounds rang out, and sparks flew inside and outside the village. The other soldiers who had just recovered Changma, upon hearing their roar, also rushed to Zhu Village as fast as they could. Before long, they also plunged in from around the village. Grenades bloomed everywhere in the village, and the entire enemy force was thrown into chaos. Except for the stubborn enemy commander north of the crossroads, who desperately clung to a portion of his forces to resist, most of the enemy lost their courage in the terrifying darkness. Our soldiers charged and fought like dragons and tigers. Wang Zhangde, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad of the Seventh Company, led seven soldiers into the village from the south side and happened to meet the Second Squad, which had been challenged to compete with them, collecting the guns of the stubborn enemy in the temple courtyard, making them both envious and anxious. Suddenly, they heard Deputy Platoon Leader Li Jingfu shouting softly to them, and everyone immediately followed Li Jingfu north. Nine black shadows went up and down on the wall, and in a flash, they crossed two empty courtyards and hid in the shadow of the wall. Li Jingde saw several stubborn enemy soldiers through the gunhole in the north wall, squeezing into a dark room to the west like startled rats. He turned back and beckoned to Wang Zhangde, then immediately jumped onto the wall and landed gently in the courtyard. Wang Zhangde followed suit, and the other seven people had already surrounded the courtyard. Wang Zhangde groped to the window and looked inside. In the darkness, more than twenty stubborn enemy soldiers were huddled together in fear. He quickly retreated two steps, reached out, and threw a grenade into the door. Li Jingfu also threw one in. As the grenades exploded, the people in the room shouted in unison, \"We surrender! We surrender!\" Immediately afterward, a mortar tube was thrown out of the door. Wang Zhangde was still not at ease. He rushed in with a stride, and in the darkness, twenty-four stubborn enemy soldiers suddenly saw the flash of a bayonet approaching, and they knelt down in panic, clapping their hands and shouting, \"We don't have any guns! We don't have any guns!\" Li Jingfu continued to scout forward. At the corner of a dead alley, two heads wearing American-style caps poked out, peeking around. Li Jingfu thought that these must be guys looking for an opportunity to escape, and he quickly ordered two soldiers to block the alley entrance. He and Wang Zhangde rushed in in one breath. When the two guys poked their heads out again, they happened to be hit by a grenade explosion. The corner immediately cried out, \"Ah! Don't shoot! We surrender...\" They went up to take a look, and there were more than ninety people in total, some unarmed and some holding guns. Li Jingfu shouted loudly, and the stubborn enemy soldiers all put down their guns one by one. After saying a few comforting words to calm them down, they were taken to the rear in teams. Immediately afterward, Wang Zhangde discovered a large courtyard full of mules and horses, with two heavy machine guns and more than thirty rifles scattered on the ground, as well as several boxes of shells. He ordered two soldiers to guard them, and then hurriedly followed the deputy platoon leader and two soldiers to break through to the north. In a courtyard in front, there were chaotic noises and gunshots from the enemy. Because the courtyard wall was high and difficult to climb, Wang Zhangde threw a grenade over the wall, and the courtyard immediately became silent. At this time, Li Jingfu had nimbly sneaked to the courtyard gate and looked inside. Three wounded stubborn enemy soldiers were lying in the courtyard, groaning softly. He looked around the courtyard and knew that the enemy had nowhere to run. He quickly threw a grenade into the south room and shouted, \"Those who surrender will not be killed; we are all Chinese.\" Then he heard a \"thud!\" A mortar was thrown out of the door, followed by \"Zhongzheng rifles\" like locusts thrown out of the door and window black holes, landing in the moonlight. When the stubborn enemy soldiers came out of the house, afraid that our soldiers would shoot, they clapped their hands high and kept shouting, \"Out, out!\" Only when they saw our soldiers greeting them did they feel relieved. Truly \"trained Nationalist soldiers\"! This is how Chiang Kai-shek's American weapons were let go by his soldiers. In the ten-minute battle between the Sixth Squad and the enemy in Li Village, the results were: more than 170 stubborn enemy soldiers captured, 64 mules and horses, two mortars, two heavy machine guns, and more than 120 rifles... We had no casualties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 十分钟的战斗\n\n1946-08-22\n第2版()\n专栏：太岳通讯\n\n　　十分钟的战斗            太岳通讯\n    十三号夜里我军收复当马村后，五连两个排把一连蒋军一直追赶到朱村，顽军在朱村东门楼上架了一挺机枪，迎着这两个排狂叫起来，但是我们的副连长黄建利，冒着弹雨，英勇地冲了上去，一连四个手榴弹，就把顽军赶到村里。我们没停脚，一直攻进村里，占了四座院子，村内的顽军恐慌了，急急开动了山炮、步兵炮、迫击炮和架在树上的机关枪，立时各种声音响成一片，村里村外火花飞溅，其他刚收复常马的战士们，一听到他们的吼叫，也快步如飞的增援到朱村来，不一会就从村周围也扑了进去，手榴弹在村里到处开花，全村顽军慌乱的混成一团，除了十字路北的顽军指挥官，还死力抓住一部分兵力挣扎抵抗外，大部顽军在这恐怖的黑夜里丧魂失魄了。我们的战士们生龙活虎的冲杀着。七连的六班长王章德，领着七个战士，从村南面冲进去时，正遇见与自己挑战的第二班，在收缴庙院顽军的枪，使得他们又羡慕又着急，猛然间我们听见副排长李景福向他们小声喊叫，大家就立刻跟着李景福向北奔去，九个黑影子在墙头上忽上忽下，霎时翻过两座空院隐蔽在墙荫下。李景德从北墙的枪眼里望见几个顽军，像受惊的老鼠，挤着往西边黑屋里钻，他回头向王章德一招手，立即纵身跳上墙头，轻轻落到院里，王章德照样跟上来，其他七个人已经把院子包围起来了。王章德摸到窗前往里瞧，黑暗中二十多个顽军吓得缩成了一团，他火速退了两步，伸手将一个手榴弹仍进门里，李景福也跟着扔进去一颗，随着手榴弹爆炸，屋里同声喊出“我们缴枪！我们缴枪！”紧接着一门迫击炮筒就从门里扔出来，王章德还不放心，一个箭步冲进去，黑暗里二十四个顽军猛见一道刺刀的闪光逼来，慌忙跪倒，不住地拍着手喊：“我们没有枪了！我们没有枪了！”李景福继续往前侦察，在一个死胡同里的拐角处，两个戴美式大盖帽的脑袋伸出来在窥探，李景福的心想这准是些想找空隙逃跑的家伙，忙叫两个战士堵住胡同口，他和王章德一口气冲了进去，等那两个家伙又伸出来时，刚好碰上手榴弹开花，拐角里马上哭叫起来“啊呀！不敢打呀！我们缴枪呀……”，他们走上去一看，徒手的持枪的共有九十多个，李景福大喊了一声，顽军们一个个都把枪放下来。说了两句宽心的话，定定他们的神，就成队的带到后面去了。紧接着王章德又发现一座大院子骡马拴得满满的，两挺重机枪和三十多枝步枪乱放在地上，还有几个炮弹箱，他叫两个战士看守着，又急忙跟着副排长和两个战士往北突去。在前面一所大院里，有敌人慌乱的喧闹声和枪声，因院墙较高不易攀登，王章德隔墙投进一个手榴弹，院内立时鸦雀无声了。这时李景福已敏捷的伏到院门口往内看，三个带伤的顽军，正躺在院里小声呻吟，他环视一下院子的情形，知道敌人没处跑，赶快向南房扔进一颗炸弹，高喊“缴枪不打，都是中国人。”接着听得“呼咚！”一声，一门迫击炮从门里抛出来，紧连着“中正步枪”像飞蝗一样从门窗黑洞里掷出来，落在月亮地里。顽军从屋里走出来时，怕我们战士开枪，高高拍着手，嘴里不住喊着：“出来了，出来了！”及至见到我们战士招呼他们才放了心。真是“有训练的国军”！蒋介石的美式武器就是这样叫他们士兵们放下了。六班在李村与敌人战斗中十分钟的战果，俘虏顽军一百七十余名，骡马六十四匹、两门迫击炮、两挺重机枪，步枪一百二十余枝………我们没有伤亡一个人。"

Eight hundred stretchers from the two counties automatically rushed to the transportation station to assemble after the first shot was fired. Women from the mountains and valleys around the front line, over forty li, formed women's stretcher teams. In Zhuru Zhi Village alone, more than 300 women voluntarily participated. Various heroic model figures played a leading role in the self-defense war. Li Yugui, a labor hero from Fengli, led the villagers to make twelve springboards day and night during the city assault battle. Model teacher Li Kejian led his students and joined the labor school and the First High School to form a comfort team, permanently stationed in the hospital serving. All the carts and livestock in Hongdong County were mobilized, and the elderly excitedly drove the carts to deliver ammunition and dry food. More than sixty old men in the first district were grinding flour for the troops day and night on twenty-two water mills. Many villages set up colored sign transfer stations, which were managed by dedicated personnel, and women fed the colored signs soup, food, and washed clothes day and night. At these transfer stations, men and women, young and old, from various villages often went to comfort them day and night, sending eggs, rice, and fruit. Liu Junying, a women's representative from Dong Yongning, a deserted area, brought eggs and rice to the hospital to comfort the soldiers after the self-defense war began, requesting to take care of the colored signs in the hospital. They said excitedly: \"This is our heart.\" Yes, they have a deeper feeling for this self-defense war because they have suffered too much persecution and massacre from Yan's puppets. Two little girls, Zhao Zhiming and Zhao Ruijin, from Santiao Gou, brought sesame candy and eggs from more than ten miles away to the hospital to comfort the soldiers. After the news of the capture of Hongdong City spread, countless comfort teams rushed to the city at midnight to help clean up the battlefield. Matou Village sent twelve carts, more than one hundred men and women, and each village sent loads of watermelons, peaches, and grapes to the city. They smiled and said along the way: \"We have won.\"\n\n　　　　People in Border Areas Organize Guerrilla Units, Want to Exchange Native Guns for American Weapons\n【Yangcheng, 18th Dispatch】The Chiang-Yan army continues to expand the civil war along the Tongpu Line, deeply invading the liberated areas. The broad masses are extremely resentful and have requested the democratic government to allow them to enlist in the army, go to the front line to repel the Chiang-Yan army's attack, and defend a peaceful and democratic life. It is reported that in the five counties of Jincheng, Yicheng, Gaoping, Changzi, and Tunliu alone, there are 10,000 farmers who voluntarily request to join the army to defend the motherland. Li Fuhai, a farmer from Dong Dayang Village in Jincheng, said when he requested to enlist: \"The Kuomintang reactionaries and the American reactionaries collude together to massacre the Chinese people. If they come, we will have no way to survive. I am willing to go to the front line to resist the attack of the reactionaries. Even if I personally sacrifice, it is glorious to protect the people's peace and democracy and protect the country's independence.\" People in the border areas have spontaneously organized guerrilla units. The local gun company of the Wangwu Sanyuan Joint Defense Village has one hundred and five people and is equipped with heavy fire weapons such as machine guns and grenade launchers. The People's Security Team was established in Xiangling. The militiamen took out old weapons such as raised guns, \"pulaji\" cannons (also called chicken coop cannons), hand-held cannons, bird guns, and machetes for use.

The call stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to pursue dictatorship and civil war, collude with American imperialist elements and do not hesitate to sell out national interests, opening the door wide for American goods. The rampant influx of American goods has brought the national industry of the Kuomintang areas to the brink of extinction, and the industry of the Liberated Areas will become the fruit of national industry and national capital, and the hope of the country. The government and the military and civilians of the entire region should cherish this budding national industrialization, launch a movement to advocate the use of local goods, and promote the spirit of hard struggle of self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and self-sufficiency from the past eight years, so that the economy of the Liberated Areas will not be affected by this and will become increasingly prosperous. To this end, the following is called for: 1. Patriotic merchants throughout the region should serve the people of the Liberated Areas, exchange products of the Liberated Areas, and not act as compradors of foreign goods, but root their business in helping people's production and supplying people's needs, and learn from Wu'an merchants. 2. All industries and handicrafts should strive to improve, so as to achieve low cost, good quality, high output, and wide sales. The government will also reward inventions and creations. 3. The broad masses of the people should use local goods, which is a sign of awareness of saving the country and saving themselves.

Luo Longji, head of the Propaganda Committee of the China Democratic League, when meeting with reporters on the 15th, first listed the recent banning of 120 magazines in Rongkun by the National Government. He then made the following remarks on Chiang Kai-shek's proclamation, namely that Chiang Kai-shek was lying when he said that \"wartime laws restricting the people's freedom have been repealed or amended.\" Luo then went on to denounce the six guidelines in Chiang's proclamation, the first three of which completely violate the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). He said: \"First, the National Assembly is scheduled to be convened in November of this year. This date was decided by the government itself without consultation with the PCC and various parties; second, to gather opinions from all sides for the National Assembly's reference in drafting the constitution. This means the government will draft the constitution on its own, overturning the resolutions of the PCC; third, to broaden the foundation of the government and invite various parties and non-partisans to participate. This means the government will invite parties on its own canceling the resolutions of the PCC.\" Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's proclamation that the CCP should abandon its armed forces, Luo stated that the Democratic League is now a political party that adheres to the constitution and seeks peaceful and legal means. However, the Democratic League has not received legitimate and equal treatment. Leaders of the Democratic League have been kidnapped in Beiping and assassinated in Kunming. With these facts existing, how can a political party with armed forces dare to lay down its arms?

This is just a corner of the uninhabited zone in Hongdong.\n　　Yan Xishan first appointed Zhang Conglong, the notorious and heinous puppet county chief of Anze who deserved to be cut into pieces, as the head of the Hongdong \"United Committee,\" and then appointed him as the county chief and commander of the \"Hongdong Corps.\" The so-called Hongdong Corps was Zhang Conglong's confidant troops. Zhang Conglong was a famous \"man-eating county chief\" in Hongdong. People in Subao personally saw him kill a village head in Baicun and eat his heart. People here turn pale at the mention of Zhang Conglong. Under Zhang Conglong's rule in Hongdong, coupled with Yan Xishan's various policies—\"integration of soldiers and farmers,\" \"credit grain purchase,\" and the civil war—\"uninhabited zones\" were first created in Hexi, and then in nine villages near the city, including Dongxi Fengbao, Dongxi Yongning, Sanyangbao, Sanzhoubi, and Guxian. Doors and windows were sealed with cobwebs, weeds filled the courtyards, the population fled, the land was barren, and there was no sign of human habitation within ten miles.\n　　The uninhabited zones of Sanyangbao, Dongxi Yongning, etc., began to form in March of this year. At that time, although the villagers of Yongning knew that the county chief in the city was the former traitor county chief Zhang Conglong, and the troops were Zhang Conglong's traitorous troops, they had to maintain the status quo as before under the butcher knife of the man-eating Zhang Conglong. Zhang Conglong was a ruthless traitor who killed without blinking an eye, coupled with Yan Xishan's insatiable plundering policies—\"integration of soldiers and farmers,\" \"credit grain purchase,\" and the civil war. Regarding the \"credit grain purchase,\" one tael of silver was used to requisition six shi of grain, and later there were assignments of meals and cloth. For example, in Yongning, Du Baode's eight mu of land yielded a total of sixteen shi last autumn, but he had to bear fourteen shi of corn, two shi of rice, fifty jin of cotton, four zhang and five chi of cloth, and over a hundred meals. If he did not hand over the grain, he would be tied up and imprisoned, and if he still could not pay, he would be sentenced to death. There were countless such incidents. After March, the common people could no longer maintain their livelihoods, but Zhang Conglong's slogan was \"Rather die in battle than starve to death.\" What could the villagers of Yongning and other villages do? They could only flee, fleeing to villages such as Nanqin, Shiji, and Podui, and some rose up in resistance, killing the uncle of village chief Li Juru, because he colluded with Li Juru. Zhang Conglong and Li Juru then threatened Yongning village, saying they would \"burn Yongning village and kill everyone, big and small,\" and they also opened the weir of the water channel for the villagers of Sanyangbao, wanting to starve the people of Sanyangbao to death. From then on, the common people completely fled.\n　　The villages of Sanzhoubi and others were originally anti-Japanese base areas, but Zhang Conglong's evil hand also extended here, demanding grain, money, and manpower. The people of Sanzhoubi ignored him, especially when Zhang Conglong put forward \"May is the month of bloodshed!\" This was the final warning to Sanzhoubi, if you do not maintain the status quo, you will all be killed in May. At this time, Li Zhenxin, an old man in his seventies, was stabbed to death by Yan's soldiers in the field. Li Baocai was picking firewood in the field when he was shot to death by more than ten guns. Tragic cases occurred one after another. The common people who had struggled, especially the people of Hongdong, were not intimidated. On the contrary, it made them launch a \"life-saving battle.\" They put forward the slogan—\"Never let Zhang Conglong snatch a single grain of food, if he snatches one, he will bleed!\" The fierce struggle to defend their own lives began. Zhang Conglong again threatened the masses, \"All people under forty and over sixteen are militiamen, kill them all!\" Under this bloody slaughter, batches of people fled to even more distant places. At first, they fled to Fengcun, Shiqiao, and Nanqin, five miles away, but Zhang Conglong chased them to Shiqiao, and they fled again to villages such as Santiaogou, more than ten miles away. But a farmer cannot forget his own land. Every morning, they secretly brought dry food back to their land to farm, and countless people were killed! Yin Zhu of Xifengbao went back to farm and was stabbed to death in the field with bayonets. These lands flowed with their sweat and were drained of their blood. Later, because they could only work four or five hours a day, and the weeds in the fields grew taller than the crops, the farmers were anxious and the whole family went to the fields. At that time, the land was dry, there were many weeds, the weather was hot, and people were hungry. They pulled weeds while shedding tears. They sighed, \"What sins have we committed in generations to suffer such great torment?\" Later, because of the hot weather, hunger, heavy work, they also contracted cholera and dysentery. Many people got sick, and many people died. When they saw a staff member of a democratic government, or a few Eighth Route Army soldiers, they cried out their suffering, asking the army to come and save them quickly. They could no longer wait. They were suffering from hunger, disease, and being shot to death. They had homes but could not return!!\n\n(Jin Sha)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 洪洞无人区一角\n金沙\n1946-08-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　洪洞无人区一角\n    自从阎锡山将洪洞、赵城、霍县等伪军改编，实行“兵农合一”、“赊购粮”等政策以来，造成了无数的“无人区”。这里仅是洪洞无人区的一角。\n    阎锡山在洪洞首先把罪恶昭彰、应该千刀万剐的安泽伪县长张从龙，委为洪洞“统委会”长后，又委为县长兼“洪洞兵团”团长，所谓洪洞兵团就是张从龙的亲信部队。张从龙在洪洞是出名的“吃人心县长”，苏堡的人亲眼见他杀了白村一个闾长，并吃了他的心。这里的人谈起张从龙来是谈虎变色的。洪洞在张从龙的统治下加上阎锡山的“兵农合一”、“赊购粮”……首先是在河西，其次即在城附近东西冯堡、东西永凝、三阳堡、三周壁、古县等九个村子造成了“无人区”，门窗蛛封，蒿草满院，人口逃亡，土地荒芜，十里地内无人烟。\n    三阳堡、东西永凝等无人区是今年三月开始形成的。当时永凝村虽然明知城内县长是以前的汉奸县长张从龙，部队是张从龙的汉奸部队，可是在吃人心的张从龙的屠刀之下，他们不得不像从前一样的维持了。张从龙是个杀人不眨眼的汉奸，又加上掠夺无厌的阎锡山的各种政策——“兵农合一”、“赊购粮”及内战，关于“赊购粮”一项一两银子征六石粮食，以后还有派饭派布。如永凝杜宝德去年秋季八亩地共打十六石，即负担玉茭十四石，大米二石，棉花五十斤，布四丈五尺，饭一百余顿。如果不交粮食就捆去坐牢，再无法缴纳，最后处以死刑，此类事件不知有多少。从三月以后老百姓已经无法维持，可是张从龙的口号“宁愿战死，不愿饿死”。永凝等村老百姓有什办法？只有逃亡，逃到南秦、石机、坡堆等村子，也有的起来反抗，这时打死了编村村长李九如的舅父，因他与李九如狼狈为奸。张从龙、李九如这时威胁永凝村，要“火烧永凝村，大小人都劈死”，并且又把三阳堡老百姓的吃水渠的堰放开。要干死三阳堡的人，从此起老百姓完全逃亡外出。\n    在三周壁等村子原来就是抗日根据地，可是张从龙的魔手也伸到这里要粮、要款、要人，三周壁的人置之不理，特别是到了五月，张从龙提出来“五月流血月！”这就是对三周壁下的最后警告，如果你们再不维持，将在五月里杀尽你们。这时就有七十多岁的老汉李振新，在地里被阎军刺死，李保才在地里拾柴，被十多条枪瞄准打死，惨案接连的发生。斗争出来的老百姓，特别是洪洞人没有被吓倒，相反地使他们展开“保命战”，他们提出了口号——“决不让张从龙抢走一颗粮食，抢走一颗也要他流血！”保卫自己生命的激烈斗争开始了。张从龙又威胁群众“凡是四十岁以下十六岁以上的人，都是民兵，统统杀死！”在这血腥屠杀之下，老百姓一批一批的逃亡流浪到更远的地方去。起先他们流亡到五里外的封村、石桥、南秦，但张从龙赶到石桥，又逃到十余里以外的三条沟等村子。可是一个庄稼人忘不了自己的土地的，每天早上偷偷的带上干粮回到自己的土地上去种地，不知被杀死了多少！西冯堡的银柱回去做庄稼，被他们用刺刀刺杀在地里，这些土地上流过他们的汗，又流尽了他们的血。到后来因为一天只能做四五小时的活，又加地里的草长得比庄稼还高，庄稼人着急了，全家下地。那时地干草多，天热人饥，他们一面拔草，一面落下泪来，他们叹息着：“几辈子作了孽，受这样大的罪？”后来又因为天热、人饥、活重，又犯了霍乱痢疾，好多人病了，好多人死了。他们见到一个民主政府的工作人员，或几个八路军，他们就哭诉着自己的痛苦，要军队快来救他们。他们已经不能等待，他们在受着饥饿、疾病、枪杀的迫害，他们有家归不得！！         \n                                       （金沙）"

    "content": "Victory Breakout\n    Interview with General Fang Shengpu\n    At noon on the 29th, we visited Deputy Brigade Commander Fang Shengpu with feelings warmer than the July sun. He, along with Brigade Commander Pi Dingjun, led thousands of brave soldiers, broke through the heavy blockade of the Chiang army from the Dabie Mountains, crossed the Hefei-Yeji Highway, Huainan Highway, and Jinpu Railway, and marched over a thousand miles to reach the Suwan Liberated Area.\n\n    Although he had gone through more than twenty days of fighting and marching, Deputy Brigade Commander Fang was full of energy and showed no signs of fatigue. After understanding our purpose, he warmly shook hands with us, led us to his room, and invited us to sit at a rectangular table. He readily opened a tattered pocket map on the table and began to speak frankly.\n\n    \"Before the breakout, the Central Plains troops were active in the Dabie Mountains. This area is about two hundred miles long from east to west and fifty to sixty miles wide from north to south, and is strictly blockaded on all sides. The Chiang army besieging us numbered 400,000, all commanded by Liu Zhi. The reactionaries deployed three lines of blockade east of the Dabie Mountains: the first was a fortress line, with their sentries facing our sentries across the mountains. The second was the line of Huangchuan, Gushi, and Lihuang, and the third was the Huainan Highway and the Hefei-Yeji Highway. The main force of the Chiang army pressed against our army from the northeast, attempting to force our main force to withdraw from the mountains and annihilate it in the plains. The reactionaries made a wishful calculation and launched a general offensive on June 26. However, we saw through the reactionaries' conspiracy and poisonous plan, and our Central Plains troops unexpectedly and decisively broke through in separate directions. Our brigade was ordered to transfer south of Shangcheng and Guangshan, and was immediately attacked fiercely by the Chiang army. After fierce fighting, we broke through the first line of defense of the Chiang army, and then fought against the Chiang army blocking us near Macheng. Then we walked and fought, intermittently and never stopped. After crossing the natural danger of Songziguan on the border of Hubei and Anhui, we entered Dahua Township via Wujiadian, east of Huangchuan River. We smashed the encirclement of the 4th Regiment of the Anhui Security Force, crossed the Mozi Pool, which was as deep as our necks. Although enemy bullets were flying on the surface of the water, they could not stop us from advancing. Later, we went north from Mao Yuanchang and Henggutan between Shucheng and Huoshan, and crossed the Hefei-Yeji Highway at Guanting on July 10. When we reached the Huainan Highway, we were again blocked by a part of the 138th Division of the Gui system troops in Xiatangji. In Zhujiawan and Shajian in Dingyuan, we smashed the blockade of the puppet army Sun Liangcheng. At dawn on July 20, we rushed across the Jinpu Road and fought against the 138th Division of the Gui army intercepting us near Jiashanbian Station. This battle was the largest and most fierce. The Chiang army used armored vehicles to cover the train, and continuously reinforced it. We fought while covering the rearguard troops. By sunrise, all of us had safely crossed the road. A particularly heroic scene was our soldiers climbing the moving Chiang army armored train regardless of their own safety.\" Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said with a smile, \"We threw grenades like a storm into the carriages, and the Chiang army inside screamed incessantly. Although their casualties could not be counted, it is estimated that few could survive.\"\n\n    How was this unit commanded? Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said: \"In order to travel lightly and facilitate marching, we didn't bring anything, not even a military map. We only relied on two things to determine the breakout route: this only pocket map and a compass. In order to grasp the direction and command the battle, Brigade Commander Pi and I walked at the forefront of the troops for more than twenty days and nights. Fortunately, we didn't take a wrong turn once.\" Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said: \"The weather was hot and there was a lot of rain along the way, and some difficulties occurred. But due to the iron revolutionary will of officers and soldiers seeking peace and survival, we finally overcame everything. In every 24 hours, there can only be one or two hours of rest in the middle of the night. The brutal Chiang army was ready to attack us from all directions at any time. As soon as there was enemy information, as soon as the gunfire rang, everyone was energetic and excited. The soldiers said, \"When fighting, we are full of energy, and we don't feel sleepy!\" We passed through many high mountains, dense forests and narrow passes. From Songziguan to Dahua Township, life was the most difficult. The mountains are big and the villages are small, and there is a shortage of food. For a few days, we could only eat one meal a day. Sometimes the vanguard can eat a meal, but the rearguard has nothing to eat. Sometimes we can only buy some melons and corn from the common people and eat them raw. Sometimes there is nothing, so we can only drink some cold water to satisfy our hunger. ...In short, the hardships are endless, even a night of sleep and a full meal are rare. However, we did not bow our heads to difficulties, we conquered all difficulties, just as we defeated the reactionaries who attacked us along the way.\"\n\n    Deputy Brigade Commander Fang said excitedly: \"Along the way, the Chiang army collapsed at the first touch, and their combat effectiveness was weak. Our army suffered more than 30 casualties, but the Chiang army suffered at least 30 times more casualties than our army. Our brigade has completed the task assigned to us by our superiors. Now Zhang Tixue's East Hubei Independent Brigade and our brigade's guerrilla troops are still fighting for peace and democracy in Lihuang, Yingru, Yuexi, Qianshan, Taihu and other places under the Dabie Mountains. The troops that broke out to the west are advancing victoriously. We want to tell the enemy: the Communist army cannot be wiped out or surrounded. It will create history and create miracles. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, victory will surely belong to us.\"\n\n    Deputy Brigade Commander Fang's forceful tone stopped abruptly here. Two hours of conversation, a great historical trace was engraved on the reporter's heart. I silently pay my highest respect to thousands of combat heroes!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 胜利突围  方升普将军访问记\n章海蓝\n1946-08-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　胜利突围\n    方升普将军访问记\n    二十九日正午，我们怀着比七月的阳光更热的感情，去访问刚从中原突围出来胜利到达苏皖解放区的方副旅长升普将军。他是和旅长皮定钧将军一同率领数千健儿，从大别山冲破蒋军重重封锁，穿过合叶公路、淮南公路、津浦铁路，徒步长征千余里而到达此间的。\n    虽然经过二十余天战斗行军，但方副旅长精神饱满，毫无倦容。当他了解我们的来意后，亲切地和我们紧握着手，把我们引到他的房间，请我们在一张长方桌边坐下。他顺手在桌上翻开一本破烂的袖珍地图，就开始侃侃而谈了。\n    “中原部队在突围前，都在大别山上活动。这个地区东西长约二百里，南北宽五六十里，四面八方都被严密封锁。围攻我们的蒋军有四十万，都由刘峙指挥。反动派在大别山以东就布置三道封锁线：第一道是堡垒线，其哨兵与我们哨兵隔山相望。第二道为潢川、固始、立煌一线，第三道是淮南公路与合叶公路。蒋军主力从东北方向我军压迫，企图迫使我主力退出山地，在平原地区一举歼灭。反动派打好了如意算盘，便于六月二十六日开始总攻。可是我们窥破了反动派的阴谋毒计，我中原部队乃出其不意，毅然决然分路突围，我们这一旅受命向商城、光山以南转移，当日即遭蒋军猛烈攻击，经激战后突破蒋军第一道防线，继在麻城附近和堵击的蒋军打起来。接着边打边走，断断续续从未休止。越过鄂皖边界松子关天险之后，经吴家店潢川河东，进入大化坪。我们打垮了皖保安第四团的包围，渡过深及头颈的磨子潭，敌人子弹虽在水面上飞舞，但亦无法阻止我们前进。后由舒城、霍山之间的毛垣厂、恒古潭向北，七月十日于官亭穿过合（肥）叶（家集）公路，到了淮南公路，在下塘集又遭桂系部队一三八师一部堵击。在定远之朱家湾、沙涧等地，打垮伪军孙良诚的堵击。七月二十日拂晓，冲过津浦路，在嘉山边站附近和截击的桂军一三八师作战，这一仗规模最大也最激烈。蒋军用装甲车掩护火车，不断增援。我们一面作战，一面掩护后卫部队。至日出时，全部安然过路。特别英勇的一幕是我们的战士奋不顾身攀登开动中的蒋军装甲火车。”方副旅长带着微笑说：“把手榴弹像暴风雨一般的投向车厢，里面的蒋军嚎叫不已。他们的伤亡虽无法统计，但估计能够生还的不多”。\n    这一支部队是怎样指挥的呢？方副旅长说：“我们为了轻装便于行军，什么都没有带，连一张军用地图都没有。我们只靠两件东西确定突围路线，便是这唯一的一本袖珍的地图和一部指南针。为了掌握方针，指挥战斗，二十几昼夜我与皮旅长都是走在部队的最前头。幸而我们没走过一次错路。”方副旅长说：“一路上天气热，雨水多，曾发生一些困难。但由于官兵一致的求和平求生存的铁的革命意志，终于战胜了一切。在每天二十四小时中，只能有夜半一两个钟头的休息。残暴的蒋军，就在四面八方随时都准备打击我们。只要一有敌情，枪声一响，便个个精神百倍，兴奋起来。战士们说：“一打仗浑身都是劲儿，瞌睡就不来了！”我们经过不少高山密林隘道。从松子关到大化坪，生活最苦，山大村小，粮食缺少，有几天一天只能吃一顿。有时前卫能吃到一顿，后卫就没得吃。有时只能向老百姓买点瓜和玉米之类生吃。有时不论啥都没有，只能喝点冷水充饥。……总之，困苦是谈不尽的，即便是一夜的安眠，一顿饱饭都是不可多得的。但是，我们没有向困难低头，我们征服了一切困难，也正如打垮沿途攻击我们的反动派一样。”\n    方副旅长兴奋的说：“一路上打仗，蒋军都是一触即垮，战斗力低弱。我军共伤亡三十余人，但蒋军伤亡至少三十倍于我军。我们这一旅已经完成了上级给我们的任务，现在我鄂东独立旅张体学部及我旅的游击部队，仍在大别山下立煌、英如、岳西、潜山、太湖等地为和平民主而坚持斗争。向西突围部队正胜利的前进。我们要告诉敌人：共产党部队是消灭不了包围不了的，他会创造历史，创造奇迹。在毛泽东的旗帜下，胜利必然是属于我们的。”\n    方副旅长有力的语调到这里截然停止了。两个钟头的谈话，一段伟大的史迹刻上了记者的心头。我在默默中向数千个战斗英雄们致以崇高的敬意！"

    "content": "Soviet Union's First Post-War Air Force Day\n　  Moscow People Celebrate Joyously\n　　Millions Look Up to Watch Air Force Performance; Capitals of All Republics Fire Salutes in Celebration\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet people enthusiastically celebrated their first post-war Air Force Day yesterday. The Central Aviation Club airfield in Tushino, Moscow, attracted hundreds of thousands of residents and representatives from the Soviet capital and various Soviet republics. The club's balconies and box seats were decorated with green branches and flowers. The audience welcomed Soviet Party and government leaders such as Stalin, Voroshilov, Beria, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Shvernik, Zhukov, and Bulganin with thunderous applause. At 1:00 PM, the air show began. After the national flag was raised, three thousand multicolored flying balloons ascended into the air, and flames radiating beneath the clouds emitted dazzling sparks. Then, led by the veteran Russian pilot Rodin, forty-two \"Po-style\" aircraft appeared in the formation of a five-pointed star. The pilots were all Rodin's students and aerial heroes in this anti-fascist war. Following their five-pointed star team was a performance by air defense association pilots, which was met with loud admiration from the audience. Another interesting performance was the \"head-to-head\" formation formed by two aircraft. One aircraft flew in a normal posture, while the other, higher aircraft flew upside down. Several \"Po-2\" aircraft slowly flew across the sky, connected by silk scarves, forming a special formation. After the \"Po-2\" aircraft disappeared, \"Duke-style\" aircraft appeared on the airfield. The wings of this type of aircraft were not in front of the aircraft's frame, but behind it. Aircraft with propeller-driven engines followed the \"Duke-style\" aircraft. In the fighter plane performances, the most interesting were the performances by two teams of five aircraft each designed by Yakovlev and Lavochkin: they flew upside down in tight formations across the sky, like horses racing on a racetrack.

    "content": "A Visit to the Democratic Allied Forces of Jiangsu and Shandong\n\nOn July 7th, I, as a reporter, accompanied General Wang Shuwen, Deputy Commander of the Democratic Allied Forces of Jiangsu and Shandong, on a special trip to visit the various units of the Allied Forces. Our first destination was the rear guard headquarters. As we approached our destination, the car turned onto a newly built wide road, lined with neat rows of locust and poplar trees, which the Allied Forces had planted and constructed during their training in their spare time. Soon, we saw a tall gatehouse with a large stone tablet in the center, inscribed with the words \"Gate of Revolution\" in the handwriting of Commander-in-Chief Hao Pengju.\n\nThe rear guard headquarters was located in a large courtyard. The Allied Forces had built a large auditorium here that could accommodate thousands of people. Nearby, there was a hospital training class, headed by Commander-in-Chief Hao's wife, Ms. Liu Qiong, with Deputy Commander Wang's wife as the chief instructor. There were more than ninety students in total, all family members of the Allied Forces. In addition, there was Chen Yi Primary School, a school for the children of the Allied Forces, with nearly a thousand students. The principal said: Commander-in-Chief Hao named the school after Commander Chen Yi to thank him for facilitating the Allied Forces' separation from the reactionary clique and obtaining the great help of the people, as a memorial.\n\nThe reporter then went to visit the Allied Forces' Training Regiment. The regiment originally had units such as a cadre brigade, an officers' team, a student team, and a political training class. The students in this team were mostly officers above the rank of battalion commander, and on-the-job cadres were selected for military training on a rotational basis. The curriculum focused on political and ideological education, closely combining the theory and practice of serving the people. Deputy Commander Wang briefly described the purpose of establishing the Training Regiment: Since our Allied Forces launched the uprising, we have been determined to thoroughly transform the troops by standing on the side of the people. To achieve this goal, we must carry out the transformation from the bottom up, so we established the Training Regiment. Commander-in-Chief Hao personally drafted two training orders for this purpose: stipulating that realizing New Democracy and serving the people should be the basic direction, and that building an independent, free, democratic, and prosperous New China should be the goal of the Allied Forces' struggle.\n\nUnder this training purpose, the Training Regiment first established a revolutionary political work system—a political instructor was set up in the brigade, and a guidance counselor was set up in the district team, to carry out the transformation of political thought. The Allied Forces headquarters stipulated the abolition of the beating and scolding system. This important task of getting rid of the traditional bad habits of the old army initially encountered some obstacles, but was later successfully overcome. This reform was warmly welcomed by the vast number of soldiers and lower-level cadres.\n\nAfter the graduates of the Training Regiment returned to their units, they spread what they had learned to the companies. Various units of the Allied Forces organized visiting groups to visit the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army units, gaining great inspiration in improving officer-soldier relations and military-civilian relations. Now, a political work system has been established in various units of the Allied Forces. Soldiers manage their own meals and hold soldiers' congresses, greatly enhancing their enthusiasm and initiative. When soldiers are sick, officers personally take care of them. Each division has a soldiers' theater troupe, which often cooperates with local rural theater troupes to hold military-civilian get-together. The soldiers have learned many songs popular in the liberated areas, such as \"March of the Eighth Route Army,\" \"Song of the Democratic Allied Forces,\" and various Yangko tunes.\n\nAfter visiting the sports field and the repair shop, the reporter continued to accompany Deputy Commander Wang to the Allied Forces headquarters. Along the way, there were newly built colorful arches in the villages we passed. According to the soldiers accompanying us, these were the remnants of the enthusiastic farewells from the common people when the Allied Forces went to the front line of the self-defense war. In many villages and towns, the masses brought large quantities of tea, cigarettes, and other items. Yangko teams played drums and music everywhere we went. This sincere enthusiasm moved many commanders and fighters to tears.\n\nAfter arriving at the headquarters, Commander-in-Chief Hao talked about the uprising in a reminiscing tone, saying: \"As early as a year before the Japanese surrender, we organized a 革新同志会 (Reform Comrades Association), uniting comrades to strive for the democratic construction of China after the war. Cadres above the regimental level in the Allied Forces all participated in this association because everyone was dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule.\" Liu Boyang, Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces, said: \"Several senior cadres in the Allied Forces were fugitives who had escaped from the reactionary rule of the Chiang government. In order to find a way out in terms of political thought, they contacted the domestic democratic forces before the enemy surrendered. After reading Chairman Mao's \"On Coalition Government\" and \"On New Democracy,\" they more clearly recognized the hope and future of the Chinese people.\"\n\nOn August 18th of last year, when Commander-in-Chief Hao was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Sixth Route Army, the Allied Forces wanted to launch an uprising, but it failed to materialize because the time was not ripe. Later, they received orders from the Kuomintang authorities to go north to attack the New Fourth Army. On December 31st, when the troops arrived at the Yunhe (Grand Canal) front line, they decided to launch an uprising against the civil war. On January 5th of this year, Commander-in-Chief Hao convened a meeting of cadres above the battalion level to reveal the plan for the uprising. After issuing the uprising telegram on January 9th, they marched to the liberated area on the night of the 10th. Several lower-level cadres of the Allied Forces described that although the night march was extremely exhausting when the Allied Forces arrived in the liberated area, they forgot their fatigue when they saw the New Fourth Army representatives shaking hands with Commander-in-Chief Hao to congratulate him. The colorful banners with slogans such as \"Welcome Commander-in-Chief Hao's Glorious Uprising,\" \"Oppose Civil War,\" and \"Oppose Dictatorial Rule\" were posted all over the long street, and tens of thousands of common people rushed from hundreds of miles away to welcome them. They excitedly talked about \"the Allied Forces quickly changed their appearance not long after entering the liberated area.\" During the spring plowing, hundreds and thousands of cadres and soldiers went to the fields to push manure and plow the land for the common people; each regiment, battalion, and company lent mules and horses to the local masses for spring plowing; during the summer harvest, they enthusiastically participated in wheat harvesting and transportation. From the day the Allied Forces came to the liberated area, the democratic government and the people had been helping the Allied Forces in every possible way. In terms of grain alone, the collection and transportation of supplies for more than 20,000 people was already heavy, but the masses also enthusiastically and automatically went everywhere to express their condolences and held military-support evening parties, which really moved us very much.\n\nAt the headquarters, the reporter personally saw the 74-year-old Speaker of the Senate bringing more than 20 pigs and a batch of items to express condolences to the troops in the scorching sun. When the Allied Forces arrived at the self-defense front line to resist the Chiang army attacking the liberated area, the wave of supporting the army rose like a surging sea. Local Yangko teams and rural theater troupes constantly went to the garrisons of the various divisions and regiments of the Allied Forces to perform and express condolences, and brought a large number of慰劳品 (comfort items). Under the influence of this army-supporting upsurge, the mass discipline of the Allied Forces was further improved, and the phenomenon of desertion was eliminated in the troops. Commander-in-Chief Hao attributed the elimination of corruption, demoralization, disunity, opium smoking, gambling, and other bad habits in the troops to the environment. He said to Commander Chen Yi of the New Fourth Army: \"孟母断机杼 (Mencius's mother cutting the loom) is a very correct measure.\" Commander Chen Yi added: \"The environment is important, but the decisive factor lies in Mencius's determination.\" Indeed, the will and efforts of the people played a driving and guiding role in the transformation of the Allied Forces. The soldiers the reporter met at the self-defense front line all unanimously thanked the masses for their help. One soldier who had been in the army for seven years said: \"I have never seen such a good government and common people.\" There is no doubt that the transformation of the Allied Forces has brought a bright future to the old Chinese army, from an anti-people army to an army of the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏鲁民主联军参观记\n伊兵\n1946-08-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏鲁民主联军参观记\n    七月七日，记者随苏鲁民主联军副总司令王书文将军，专车前往参观联军各部，第一个目的地为后方留守处。将抵目的地时，汽车折入一条新筑的宽阔的公路，两旁整齐地栽着洋槐和杨柳，这是联军在练兵中利用余暇修筑与栽种的。俄顷望见一高大门楼，正中耸立一巨大石碑，上书“革命之门”。郝鹏举总司令手笔。\n    留守处所在地为一大院落。联军在此筑有可容千人之大礼堂，邻近设有医院训练班，郝总司令夫人刘琼女士任主任，王副（中缺五字）夫人为主任教官，学员共九十余人，全系联军眷属。此外尚有陈毅小学，为联军子弟学校，学生近千人。校长说：郝总司令为感谢陈毅军长促成联军脱离反动集团，得到人民方面的伟大帮助，故以陈军长之名为其校名以资纪念。\n    记者旋往参观联军教导团。该团原设有干部大队、军官队、学员队、政训班等单位。该队学员多为营级以上军官，采取轮训制抽调在职干部军训。课程以政治思想教育为主，以建立为人民服务的理论与实践密切结合。王副总司令扼要叙述成立教导团之目的：我联军自举义以来，决心站在人民立场彻底改造部队，为达此目的，必须自下而上进行改造，乃举办教导团。郝总司令为此手订两个训练要令：规定以实现新民主主义，为人民服务为基本方向，并以建立独立、自由、民主、富强的新中国为联军之奋斗目标。\n    在这个训练要旨下，教导团首先建立革命的政工制度，——大队设教导员，区队设指导员，进行政治思想的改造。联军总部规定废止打骂制度，这个摆脱旧军队传统恶习的重要课题开始时，曾遭遇若干阻碍，但后经顺利克服。这一改革受到广大战士与下级干部热烈欢迎。\n    教导团毕业学员回到部队后，就将自己所学到的东西传播到连队。联军各部——组织参观团至八路军新四军部队参观，在改进官兵关系与军民关系上得到极大的启发。现联军各部已建立政工制度，战士们自己管理伙食，召开军人大会，工作积极性与自动性大大增强。士兵患病，官长亲自护理。各师均有战士剧团，经常在驻地与农村剧团合作，举行军民联欢大会。战士们学会不少解放区流行的歌曲，如：“八路军进行曲”“民主联军歌”以及各种秧歌小调。\n    参观了运动场及修械所之后，记者继随王副总司令驱车赴联军总部。沿途所经村落，都有新建的彩牌，据同行的战士说，这是联军开赴自卫战前线时，老百姓热烈欢送的遗迹。很多村镇的群众，携来茶水、烟卷等大批物品，每过一地秧歌队鼓乐喧天，这种真诚的热情曾使许多指战员感激流泪。\n    车抵总部后，郝总司令以回忆的口吻谈起举义的经过说：“早在日寇投降前一年，我们组织了一个革新同志会，团结同志为战后中国民主建设而努力。联军团以上干部都参加这个会，因为人人都不满蒋介石的独裁统治。”联军参谋长刘伯阳说：“联军中有好几个高级干部，都是从蒋政府反动统治下逃出来的亡命者，为求政治思想上的出路，在敌寇投降前他们就与国内的民主力量发生了联系，在看了毛主席的“论联合政府”“新民主主义论”以后，更明确地认清了中国人民的希望和前途。”\n    去年八月十八日，郝总司令被编任第六路军总司令时，联军就想举义，但因时机未成熟，未能见诸公开行动。后又接到国民党当局北上进攻新四军的命令，至十二月三十一日部队到达运河前线时，乃决心举行反内战起义。今年一月五日，郝总司令召集营以上干部开会透露起义的计划，一月九日发出举义通电后，十日晚即以夜行军开赴解放区。几个联军下级干部，叙述联军到达解放区时，夜间行军虽使他们极为疲劳，但当他们发现新四军代表在与郝总司令握手道贺，“欢迎郝总司令光荣举义”，“反对内战”“反对独裁统治”的彩色大标语贴满长街，千千万万老百姓从百余里外赶来欢迎时，也就忘记了疲劳。他们兴奋的谈到“进入解放区不久联军迅速地改变了面貌”。春耕时，成百成千的干部和战士，下地为老百姓推粪耕地；各团营连将骡马借给驻地群众春耕；夏收时，又轰轰烈烈地参加割麦与运输。从联军来到解放区当天起，民主政府和人民对联军的帮助真是无微不至。单以粮食来说，二万余人给养的筹集和运输已够繁重，但民众更到处自动热烈慰问，举行劳军晚会，真使我们感动极了。\n    在总部，记者亲眼看到七十四岁的老参议长，带着二十多只猪及一批物品冒着烈日前来劳军。当联军开抵自卫前线抗击进攻解放区之蒋军时，劳军热潮如澎湃的海浪一样掀起了，各地秧歌队及农村剧团，不断地到联军各师团驻地演戏劳军，并带来大批慰劳品。在这拥军热潮影响下，联军的群众纪律更加改善，部队中消灭了逃亡现象。郝总司令把部队里消灭了贪污、腐化、不团结、吸大烟、赌博等恶习归功于环境。他对新四军陈毅军长说：“孟母断机杼，是非常正确的措施。”陈毅军长补充说：“环境固然重要，但起决定作用的却在于孟子的决心。”的确人民的意志和努力，对联军的改造起了推动与指导作用。记者在自卫前线遇到的战士，都一致感谢群众的帮助。一位当兵七年的战士说：“我从来没见过这样好的政府和老百姓。”毫无疑问，联军的改造给予中国旧军队，由反人民军队成为人民军队带来了光明的远景。"

Among these eight old ships, there are two destroyers (Taikang, Taiping), four minesweepers, named Minsheng, Yongyu, Yongding, and Yongning, and two warships (Yongtai, Yongxing). The ship names were given only after arriving in China. In the United States, they were only numbered because the tonnage was too light to qualify for naming. The largest, the Taikang ship, is only 1,300 tons, with only 10 officers and 218 soldiers on board. This large ship, which is often visited by Chinese and American officials and people from all walks of life, is only this size; the other seven ships are even smaller, with one being only over 500 tons. A week after the new fleet arrived in Beijing, the price of American cigarettes in Nanjing plummeted, and watches, pens, soap, etc., suddenly flooded the market. Upon investigation, it was found that in addition to transporting four of the latest cars, the new fleet was also loaded with the above-mentioned American goods. Xu Heng, the dismissed captain of the Yongning ship, was the biggest embezzler among this group of naval officers. When he went abroad, he bought US dollars everywhere. After arriving in the United States, he often went to the naval cooperative to purchase excessive items, which led to protests from the naval cooperative, which at one point refused to sell anything to the Chinese navy. Xu Heng is just a typical example; other officers brought back a lot of medicines and fabrics in much the same way.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石的所谓“新舰队”\n\n1946-08-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋介石的所谓“新舰队”\n    【新华社延安十八日电】据八月十四日天津益世报报导：蒋介石的所谓“新舰队”，不过是美国所给的八艘旧舰而已，这八艘旧舰中，有驱逐舰两艘（太康、太平），扫雷艇四艘，以民胜、永余、永定、永宁为名，战舰两艘（永泰、永兴）。舰名是到了中国才起的，在美国时只编号数，因为吨位轻，根本就够不上命名的资格。其中最大的太康舰，不过一千三百吨，上面仅有官员十人，士兵二百十八人。这艘常供中美长官和各界人士参观的大舰不过如此，其他七舰更小，有一艘只有五百多吨。新舰队抵京一周后，南京的美国香烟大跌价，手表、钢笔、肥皂等突告充斥，追究原因，新舰队上除了载运四辆最新式的汽车外，还载满了上述各种美国货。被撤职的永宁舰长徐亨是这一批海军军官中的舞弊大王，在出国时他就到处收买美金，到美国后，他常常到海军合作社购买超额物品，以致曾引起海军合作社的抗议，一度不卖东西给中国海军。徐亨不过是个典型，其他军官都大同小异的带了很多药品衣料回来。"

The village headman, Li Xianghong, couldn't bear it and shouted, \"You are truly unreasonable!\" He got into a scuffle with them. In the afternoon, Li Xianghong's brother was arrested and only returned after paying 100,000 yuan. They also ordered two large landlords, Pan Yu'an and Pan Guozhang, to grind flour for them for free, but then falsely accused them of mixing white clay into the flour, extorting 30 shi of wheat from them.\n　　　　　×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n　　Two soldiers from a certain company of the New Fourth Route Army stationed in Yanshougong Street, Jixian County, went to Jiaozhuang to demand firewood, scowling and shouting orders to the village heads, leaving them bewildered.

What right do you have to act tough with the people!\" The two soldiers immediately slapped him twice. He shouted angrily, \"Hit them!\" The masses rose up and beat the two soldiers. The next day, a platoon of soldiers went and arrested his grandfather, Li Lu, and took him to Daguanzhuang.

The old man watching the peaches, Yang Rongxuan, couldn't help but shout \"Who's there?\" The response was a few slaps in the face and the curse of being an old thing, and a threat to shoot him if he \"barked\" again!

Unexpectedly, that night, the company commander sent four soldiers to Xu's house to demand the 200,000 yuan back.

He openly tried to put the former enemy countries in a privileged position. The Soviet representative Vyshinsky had to use the shorthand record in hand to call on Bevin to abide by the rules. Only in this situation did Bevin have to back down. Bevin ignored the fact that he was acting as the chairman of an international conference, not as the chairman of a State Department meeting on Panama and Honduras issues. In the latter case, they can take off their coats, put their feet on the table, and feel very much at home. Bevin ignored the fact that the meeting he was chairing was attended by representatives of independent and free countries, not just servants who often become part of the Anglo-American bloc. He thought that his position as chairman was like a petty king in some places. This is Bevin's democracy. Bevin suffered a crushing defeat. The same passionate but clumsy support from the British side did not help him. The democratic principles fought for by the Soviet delegation prevailed. It is said that Bevin was very unhappy at the meeting that day.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 15th (delayed dispatch): General Guo Weicheng, former confidential secretary to General Zhang Xueliang and commander of the 110th Division of the Northeast Army, delivered a speech on the eve of \"August 15th\" at the Xinhua Broadcasting Station here, denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries' crimes of betraying the people of Northeast China fourteen years ago. Guo stated: At the time of the \"September 18th\" Incident, General Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing more than ten times in one night from Beiping for instructions, but Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly telegraphed back, forbidding resistance and ordering that the guns be collected, the warehouses locked up, and everything handed over to the Japanese army. These telegrams are still preserved to this day, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot deny them. Guo continued in a sorrowful tone, describing the tragic situation of the Northeast compatriots who fled to Guannei (areas south of the Great Wall), where they were oppressed and discriminated against, stating: After the \"September 18th\" Incident, tens of millions of Northeast compatriots, with tears in their eyes and full of enthusiasm, hoped to receive the government's support and return to the Northeast as soon as possible. However, the compatriots who fled to Guannei were branded as \"slaves of a fallen country\" by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Three hundred thousand Northeast Army soldiers were first thrown into the anti-communist war and eventually completely disintegrated and eliminated. We want to ask Chiang Kai-shek: What crime did General Zhang Xueliang and Commander Huang Xiansheng commit for loving their country and resisting Japan that they are still being arrested and detained to this day? Why were patriotic military leaders like Army Commander Wang Yizhe and Brigade Commander Gao Fuyuan put to death? All patriotic and progressive people of Northeast China have become thorns in Chiang Kai-shek's side. Zhou ×× (unclear in the telegram), Secretary-General of the Fuxing Society and Director of the Political Department of the Lu Su War Zone, even said to General Yu Xuezhong: \"The Northeast Army soldiers are all sinners of the nation and the race; killing one is one less.\" The Northeast Army soldiers who fled to Guannei, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of excluding dissidents, either died or were mostly unemployed if they survived. The families of some middle and lower-ranking officers were left unattended, leading to old and young becoming beggars and women becoming prostitutes. Guo concluded by saying: \"Now that the Northeast has been liberated, the Kuomintang reactionaries have sent hundreds of thousands of troops to 'receive sovereignty' and still want to stand on the heads of the Northeast people to enslave them again. But today's Northeast people are no longer the Northeast people of fourteen years ago! The Northeast people have the determination and confidence to defend the fruits of victory won with blood and sweat. The Northeast people will fight the Kuomintang reactionaries to the end!\" Note: General Guo Weicheng is from Zhendong County, Nenjiang Province. He served as confidential secretary and director of the political department to General Zhang Xueliang. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as Secretary-General of the Lu Su Provincial Government and Deputy Commander of the 111th Division. After \"August 15th\" last year, he returned to the Northeast and served as Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Nenjiang Province, Director of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau, and Commander of the Railway Protection Army. In June, he was elected as Chairman of the Qiqihar Provisional Consultative Conference and a member of the Nenjiang Provincial Government. Recently, he was appointed as the Commander of the West Manchuria Railway of the Democratic Allied Army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 郭维城将军播讲  控诉国民党反动派出卖东北人民罪行\n\n1946-08-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　郭维城将军播讲\n　  控诉国民党反动派出卖东北人民罪行\n    【新华社齐齐哈尔十五日电】（迟到）前任张学良将军机要秘书东北军一百一十师师长郭维城将军，顷于“八一五”前夜在此间新华广播电台发表演说，控诉国民党反动派十四年前出卖东北人民之罪行。郭氏称：“九一八”事变当时，张学良将军在北平一夜之间十几次电南京蒋介石请示，而蒋介石却十几次复电不准抵抗，叫把枪收起来，把仓库锁起来，一律点交日军。这些电文一直到现在还保存着，蒋介石是无法抵赖的。郭氏继以沉痛语调叙述东北同胞流亡关内被压迫岐视之惨状称：“九一八”事变，几千万东北同胞含着泪抱着满腔热情，希望得到政府的支持，早日打回东北来，而结果流亡在关内同胞却被国民党反动派斥为“亡国奴”，三十万东北军始而被投入反共战争，终于完全被分化瓦解与消灭。我们要问蒋介石：究竟张学良将军、黄显声师长爱国抗日有什么罪，一直到现在还被捕押？爱国军人王以哲军长、高福源旅长又为什么要被置之死地？一切爱国的进步东北人民都成了蒋介石的眼中钉，复兴社秘书长鲁苏战区政治部主任周××（电文不清）甚至向于学忠将军说：“东北军人都是国家民族的罪人，杀掉一个少一个。”流亡在关内的东北军人，在国民党反动派排斥异己政策下，死的死了，没有死的差不多都失了业，一些中下级军官的家属无人过问，以致老少流为乞丐，妇女沦为娼妓。郭氏最后说：“现在东北解放了，国民党反动派开来几十万军队接收主权，还想再来站在东北人民头上奴役东北人民，可是今天的东北人民已经不是十四年前的东北人民了！东北人民有决心和信心来保卫用血汗换来的胜利果实，东北人民将同国民党反动派奋斗到底！”按：郭维城将军系嫩江省镇东县人，曾任张学良将军机要秘书、政治处长，抗战后任鲁苏省府秘书长、一百十一师副师长，去年“八一五”后回东北，曾任嫩江省民政厅长、齐齐哈尔铁路局局长兼护路军司令员等职。六月间，被选为齐市临参会议长及嫩江省政府委员，最近又被任为民主联军西满铁路司令。"

He said: \"The United States, on the one hand, mediates the Chinese civil war, and on the other hand, transports ammunition, sends warships, guns, and artillery to Chiang Kai-shek, trains marksmen for Chiang Kai-shek, and sends military advisers to Chiang Kai-shek. Obviously, this clever 'mediation' technique was exchanged for a secret agreement between Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. In the seven months that Marshall has been in China, the consequence has been that the Chinese civil war has expanded day by day, and the Chinese people have suffered more and more. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, Chiang Kai-shek used American planes to bomb Jining and Nanle, and American-armed troops attacked eastern Henan and northern Huai, massacring peaceful people in the border region. The old folks in the border region will no longer believe Marshall's 'mediation' tactics.\" Old Man Pei said angrily: \"No matter how the United States helps Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war and makes the Chinese people suffer more, I dare to believe that the Chinese people are bound to win.\"\n\n    The revolutionary poet Wang Yaping, who recently fled to the Liberated Area, said: \"The joint statement of Marshall and Stuart is not surprising. The Chinese people have long known that American imperialist elements want China to be like the Philippines, where the Kuomintang uses secret agent terror tactics to prevent the Chinese people from asking about state affairs. But if someone betrays China, shouldn't the Chinese people ask a question? Since Marshall came to China, Chiang Kai-shek's bloody policies have become more and more rampant. The so-called Marshall mediation of the civil war only makes Chiang Kai-shek's methods more terrifying.\" Mr. Wang, the chairman of the Heze City Chamber of Commerce, said: \"The United States is pouring water on the fire while fanning the flames.

    "date": "1946-08-22",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Record of Atrocities by U.S. Troops Stationed in China\n　　Jian Sheng\n　　Due to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and obsequious behavior towards foreign powers, U.S. troops stationed in Kuomintang-controlled areas such as Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and Chongqing have acted with impunity, wantonly killing people, plundering property, raping women, and engaging in armed smuggling. The incidents of people being killed by jeeps and U.S. warships are too numerous to count. Taking Shanghai as an example, according to incomplete statistics, from September of last year to July of this year, over eleven months, such atrocities occurred almost daily. The number of people killed or injured by these atrocities reached 1,500, not including those who suffered losses from fraud, robbery, insult, and rape.\n\n　　According to an official Kuomintang material, it tells us that in the 126 days from September 12th of last year to January 10th of this year, as many as 495 jeep-related killings occurred in Shanghai alone, averaging four such tragedies every day. 236 of our compatriots were run over (including serious injuries and those who would become disabled), with 18 deaths, averaging two deaths or injuries per day (the actual number of casualties was even higher). (See Frontline Daily, January 12th). According to incomplete statistics of jeep-related tragedies published in six newspapers, in 78 jeep-related tragedies from December 8th of last year to July 28th of this year, 115 people were injured, with 34 deaths from serious injuries. Combining the above two statistics, U.S. military jeeps in Shanghai injured 380 of our compatriots. If we calculate based on the official statistic of an average of two deaths or injuries per day, approximately 600 people were injured or killed by jeeps over the eleven months.\n\n　　The largest of these tragedies was the \"Avenue Albert Bloodbath.\" According to the Associated Press, at 8 p.m. on December 8th of last year, a U.S. military 2.5-ton truck sped wildly along \"Avenue Albert,\" immediately crashing into a private car, killing one person and seriously injuring three (two of whom died after being sent to the hospital). The truck then crashed into a pedicab, killing the driver and seriously injuring the passenger. The vehicle still did not stop, speeding towards the intersection of Avenue Joffre, injuring two pedestrians, destroying several rickshaws, running over a dog, and knocking down several trees and a utility pole. The vehicle caused four incidents in total, running over and killing four people, seriously injuring three, and slightly injuring one. In another incident on April 7th, a 15-year-old girl, Zi Jufang, was knocked down by a speeding jeep, her brains splattered and her chest bleeding profusely. On the same day, a 59-year-old woman was hit from behind by a jeep, her head split open in a horrific scene (Zhengyan Daily). On June 29th, a middle-aged woman was traveling to Chengdu Road on a Route 1 tram when her arm extended out of the window and was crushed by a speeding jeep, causing severe bleeding (Zhonghua Times). The well-known Chinese playwright Xia Yan and poet Ge Baoquan were also injured by jeeps driven by U.S. troops, with Xia injuring his right hand and right leg, and Ge suffering more serious injuries (Xinbao, March 16th). Since January of this year, the tragedies have not decreased. According to a short commentary in Shanghai Xinbao, jeep-related tragedies have become \"commonplace,\" so reporters include them in the brief news column, or even omit them altogether. However, browsing through various newspapers, many tragedies are still reported.\n\n　　U.S. warships docked in the Huangpu River, like jeeps on land, frequently damaged ships and injured dockworkers. According to a statistic from the United Evening News on June 28th, an average of two dockworkers were injured every day, meaning that over the eleven months, over 600 dockworkers became victims of U.S. warships. The safety of sailors was also extremely precarious. For example, on February 16th, a barge was sunk by a U.S. landing craft, killing one person and injuring two.\n\n　　Incidents of U.S. sailors in Shanghai beating or shooting our compatriots for no reason occurred almost daily. According to statistics from a relevant authority regarding U.S. military-related injuries, damages, and losses in Shanghai, quoted in the Frontline Daily on January 21st, there were six incidents in October of last year, fourteen in November, and thirty-one in December. This means that there was an average of one incident every five days in October, which increased to one incident every two days in November, and further increased to one incident every day in December. According to incomplete statistics from six newspapers, in the thirty cases of U.S. military harm to Chinese people that occurred between December of last year and July 30th of this year, 44 people were injured, including 15 with serious injuries. If we calculate based on the average of one injury case per day in December according to official statistics, U.S. troops in Shanghai have harmed at least 300 Chinese people without reason over the past ten months. The brutality of U.S. troops is fully demonstrated in the above-mentioned injury cases. For example, on July 8th, a U.S. soldier fired a gun from a pedicab at a passerby on Chengdu Road. On the afternoon of July 30th, a U.S. soldier hired a rickshaw, and when the driver hesitated slightly because he did not understand English, the U.S. soldier cut off five of the driver's fingers with a knife. On March 30th, two U.S. sailors took a rickshaw, refused to pay, and when the driver asked for payment, the two sailors gathered a group of sailors and beat the driver, Lu Guiyin, until his head was bleeding and his bones were broken. On January 22nd, when 20,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai marched to petition outside the Bund on Beijing Road, a group of U.S. soldiers threw beer bottles at the workers from the upper floors of a building, injuring five workers, including two seriously injured. On January 12th, three U.S. sailors injured four students from Changzhou Middle School with stones at the entrance of Xieqiao Alley.\n\n　　In addition, robbery and rape also occurred frequently among U.S. troops. According to official statistics, the incidents of U.S. troops stationed in Shanghai robbing or defrauding Chinese people occurred 31 times in the 100 days from October of last year to January 10th of this year, almost once every three days. On January 12th, more than ten U.S. soldiers robbed pedestrians of their coats and watches near the Dashing Company on Nanjing Road, the busiest street in Shanghai. On March 10th, Wang Jiahua, the Chinese editor of Reuters, was robbed of several thousand yuan and beaten by four or five U.S. soldiers near Hankou Road. On December 22nd of last year, four U.S. soldiers openly robbed street vendors of cigarettes from a jeep on the Bund of Nanjing Road. On March 22nd, three U.S. sailors drank at the Sameli Bar on Nanjing Road, refused to pay, and beat the waiter.\n\n　　Incidents of U.S. troops insulting decent women also occurred frequently. According to the Shanghai Daily on April 10th, two female students from a certain school walked past Xieqiao Alley, where the U.S. military club was located, and two U.S. sailors jumped off a rickshaw and \"grabbed a petite female student like an eagle catching a chick, jumped back into the car, and the two sailors hugged her wildly.\" On June 28th, four U.S. soldiers in Chongqing openly broke into the women's bathroom of the Dasha Hotel, insulted the women who were bathing, and then gathered more than twenty U.S. soldiers to destroy the hotel. According to Zhengyan Daily, on the night of March 15th, a woman surnamed Deng on Xinchang Road was followed home by four U.S. soldiers and forcibly raped. In short, the various atrocities of U.S. troops listed above occurred frequently wherever U.S. troops were stationed, such as Qingdao, Beiping, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Even Admiral Cooke, the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in China, had to admit at a press conference in Shanghai in late March that U.S. troops stationed in China \"did have overstepping actions\" (U.S. News Service telegram, March 22nd).\n\n　　Chiang Kai-shek's government never made any protests against these atrocities by U.S. troops. On the contrary, the Kuomintang's official newspaper, Peace Daily, published a speech by U.S. Navy Patrol Commander House on March 30th, claiming that U.S. military \"illegal acts were not many.\" The Kuomintang authorities \"supplied all the most beautiful buildings in Shanghai to the U.S. military for their use\" (Shanghai Times, April 19th). Regarding the atrocities of U.S. troops, such as drunkenness and raping women, they even said that they were \"using fine wine and women to cure the 'homesickness' of their allies\" (Xinbao, March 17th).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 驻华美军暴行录\n简生\n1946-08-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　驻华美军暴行录\n　　简生\n    由于蒋介石的卖国媚外，美军在上海、青岛、天津、北平、汉口、重庆等国民党统治区横行无忌，肆意枪杀人民，劫掠财物，奸淫妇女，武装走私，吉普车和美舰杀人事件尤不可胜数。以上海为例，根据不完全的统计，自去年九月到今年七月的十一个月中，这种暴行日必数起，在暴行下死伤的人民达一千五百人，被欺诈、抢劫和侮辱奸淫而遭受损失者，尚不在内。\n    仅据国民党官方发表的一个材料，它告诉我们：在去年九月十二日起至本年一月十日止的一百二十六天中，上海一地就发生了吉普杀人事件四百九十五人之多，平均每天就有四件惨案。辗伤（包括重伤和将成残废）我同胞二百三十六人，内辗死十八人，平均每天死伤二人（实际伤亡还不只此数）。（见一月十二日前线日报）另据六个报纸所载吉普惨案的不完全统计，自去年十二月八日起至本年七月二十八日止的七十八件吉普惨案中，即有一百十五人受伤，内三十四人伤重死亡。以上两个统计，合计美军吉普车在沪辗伤我同胞即达三百八十人。如以官方统计平均每日死伤两人计，十一个月约有六百余人为吉普所伤亡。\n    惨案中最大一次为“亚尔培路血案”，据合众社称：去年十二月八日夜八时，有美军用二吨半巨型卡车一辆，沿“亚尔培路”狂驰，当即撞毁私人汽车一辆，死一人，重伤三人（内二人送医院后殒命）。该车又撞毁三轮车一辆，撞死车夫一人，乘客重伤。讵该车仍不停止，驰向巨籁达路口，又伤两路人，毁人力车数辆，并辗死一犬，且撞倒树木数枝，电线钢杆一根。该车共肇祸四起，前后辗死四人，重伤三人，轻伤一人。他如四月七日，十五岁少女紫菊芳被疾驰之吉普一辆辗倒，脑浆迸裂，胸膛血流如注。同日，一五十九岁老妇被吉普从背后撞倒，头部裂开，惨不忍睹（正言报）。六月二十九日，一中年女子乘一路电车往成都路时，手臂伸出窗外，为一疾驰之吉普轧断，鲜血淋漓（中华时报）。我国著名剧作家夏衍及诗人戈宝权，也被美军因吉普车撞伤，夏右手及右腿受伤，戈受伤甚重（三月十六日辛报）。从本年一月以来，惨案并未减少，据上海辛报短评中称：因吉普惨案已成“司空见惯”之事，故报人将其编入简讯栏，甚至不用，但翻阅各报，仍见有不少惨案登出。\n    停泊在黄浦江口中的美舰，也像陆上的吉普车一样，时常撞坏船只与小工。据六月二十八日联合晚报统计，每天总有两个小工挂彩，即是说，十一个月来，已有小工六百余人成了美舰的牺牲品。水手的生命安全亦极可虑，如二月十六日驳船一只为美登陆艇撞沉，死一人，伤二人。\n    美海军在沪无端殴打或枪杀我同胞的事件，几乎每天发生。据一月二十一日前线日报征引某主管机关关于美军在沪发生之伤害、毁坏、损害之统计中称：去年十月份共犯案六起，十一月份十四起，十二月份三十一起；亦即十月份中平均五天一起，十一月份就增为二天一起，到十二月份更激增至一天犯案一起。另据六个报纸的不完全统计：自去年十二月至今年七月三十日间发生的三十起美军伤害华人案中，受伤的人数达四十四人，内重伤十五人，若以官方统计中十二月份的伤害案为平均数、即每天犯伤害案一起死伤一人计算，十个月来美军在沪至少已无故伤害中国人民三百人。以上在这些伤害案中，充分表现美军的凶残。例如七月八日，美兵一名乘三轮车经成都路，见有路人就在车中开枪射击。七月三十日下午，美兵一人雇洋车，车夫因不懂美国话，拉车稍加迟疑，美兵即用刀砍掉车夫五指。三月三十日，美水兵两名乘三轮车，不给车资，车夫向其索取，该两兵即集合水兵一群，将车夫吕贵银打得头破血流，筋骨折断方去。又如一月二十二日，上海两万失业工人游行请愿经过北京路外滩，一群美兵竟在某大厦高层用啤酒瓶猛掷工人，击伤工人五名，内二人重伤。一日十二日，有美水兵三人在斜桥弄口，用石块殴伤常州中学学生四人。\n    此外，抢劫财物与强奸妇女，在美军中亦不断发生。据官方统计，驻沪美军抢劫或欺诈华人的事件，在去年十月至今年一月十日的一百天中，共发生三十一起，几乎平均每三日一起。一月十二日，竟有美军十余人在上海最热闹的南京路大新公司附近，结伙抢去行人的大衣手表等物。三月十日，路透社中文编辑王家骅，在汉口路附近被美兵四五人劫去数千元，复遭殴伤。去年十二月二十二日，南京路外滩一带，美军四人乘吉普车公然抢劫小贩所售香烟。三月二十二日，美海军三人在南京路沙梅利酒吧间饮酒后，不付酒资，并殴伤侍者。\n    美军侮辱良家妇女事件，亦不断发生。据四月十日上海日报载，某校两个女学生走过美国军人俱乐部所在地的斜桥弄，二个美国水兵从三轮车上跳下，“老鹰抓小鸡般地抓住一个娇小的女学生跳回车上，两个水兵狂搂着她”。六月二十八日，重庆美兵四名竟公然闯入大厦旅社女浴室，对正在沐浴的妇女百般侮辱，复纠集美兵二十余人将该旅社大肆捣毁。又据正言报载：三月十五日夜，新昌路邓姓之女，由外归家，竟被四美兵跟踪闯入，强行奸淫。总之，上面列举美军的种种暴行，举凡美军足迹所至，如青岛、北平、汉口、广州等地，均层出不穷，甚至连美驻华海军最高统帅柯克上将三月下旬在沪记者招待会上，也不得不承认驻华美军“确有越轨行动”了（三月二十二日美新闻处电）。\n    对于美军这些暴行，蒋介石政府从未提出任何抗议；相反的，国民党机关报——和平日报并于三月三十日刊载美海军巡逻司令侯斯的谈话，认为美军“不法行为，实不为多”。国民党当局将“全上海最漂亮的建筑物，全部供给美军应用”（四月十九日上海时事新报）。对于美军酗酒奸淫妇女等暴行，还说是“以醇酒妇人疗治盟友的‘思乡病’”。（三月十七日辛报）"

According to Tianjin Customs statistics, for the months of May, June, and July alone, imports of American cigarettes from Shanghai and directly from the United States, including eight brands such as Camel, reached over 152,000 cartons. At the lowest prices, the Camel and Phillip Morris brands alone were worth 100.08 million yuan. More than 40 hand-rolled cigarette factories in Tianjin have closed down due to the squeeze from American cigarettes (there were originally over 100). American goods are also being dumped in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, and the largest cigarette factory in the province, Jinxing Cigarette Factory, is in a state of near shutdown. At the same time, a \"craze for American goods\" is raging in the large and small counties and towns along the Peiping-Hankou Railway in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. \"DDT\" and American \"baking soda,\" etc., are flooding the Baoding market. Baking soda produced by China's Yongli Factory costs 50,000 yuan per bag for local delivery, while American baking soda ordered from the U.S. costs only a little over 2 U.S. dollars, or 5,000 to 6,000 legal tender yuan per bag, a difference of ten to one. According to the heads of Yongli and Jiuda, two major chemical industries, these two world-renowned large industries will be shut down because they cannot compete with American goods. In addition, a large number of American goods have recently poured into the Xi'an market, including lipstick, perfume, eyebrow pencils, glassware, clothing, khaki cloth, etc., posing a great threat to local national industries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不尽美货滚滚来  民族工业奄奄一息  美国经济侵略的血手伸入蒋占区大小城镇\n\n1946-08-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　不尽美货滚滚来\n　　民族工业奄奄一息\n　　美国经济侵略的血手伸入蒋占区大小城镇\n    【新华社延安二十日电】大批美货滚滚流入华北及西北各大小城市。据天津海关统计，仅美烟一项五、六、七三个月内由上海及直接从美国进口者，包括骆驼牌等八种共达十五万二千余条，以最低价格计其中骆驼飞利浦等五种共价值十万万零八千万元。天津手工卷烟厂受美烟排挤倒闭已达四十余家（原有一百多家）。山西太原市上也有美货倾销，全省最大规模的晋兴卷烟厂已陷半停顿状态。与此同时，平汉沿线国民党统治区大小县镇皆在大闹“美货狂”，“ＤＤＴ”和美国“苏打粉”等充斥保定市场，我国永利厂所出碱面当地交货每包须五万元，由美订苏打粉每包仅须美金二元多合法币五六千元，相差为十与一之比。据永利、久大两大化工业负责人谈，此两大世界知名的大工业将因无法与美货竞争而停顿。此外西安市上近也涌到大批美货，口红、香水、眉头、玻璃衣物、哈叽布等等，使当地民族工业遭受莫大威胁。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th (delayed dispatch). The Northeast Provinces Representative Joint Conference, lasting nine days, victoriously concluded on August 15th. The Administrative Committee held its first meeting on the same day, electing Lin Feng as Chairman, and Zhang Xuesi and Gao Chongmin (Head of the Northeast General Branch of the Democratic League, Chairman of the Andong Provincial Government) as Vice-Chairmen. All members of the Administrative Committee solemnly swore an oath of office at the closing ceremony, while also warmly celebrating the anniversary of the Northeast People's Liberation on \"August 15th.\" On that day, the conference began with Chairwoman Han Youtong reporting on the process of the Administrative Committee's first meeting electing the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen. After music was played, all members, led by the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen, raised their hands and swore an oath of office. The oath was as follows: \"We swear with utmost sincerity to serve the people of the Northeast, to fight to the end for a peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and new Northeast. If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the punishment of the people. We solemnly swear!\" Amidst thunderous applause, four female representatives presented flowers to the three Chairmen, followed by a closing speech by Comrade Lin Feng. Comrade Lin Feng first warmly celebrated the first anniversary of the Northeast People's Liberation on \"August 15th.\" When he mentioned the Northeast Anti-Japanese heroes, the Democratic United Army, and all the people of the Northeast who had sacrificed in the past fifteen years, he was too moved to speak. He then said in a spirited voice: \"In order to commemorate these national heroes, we must be determined to maintain the fruits of this revolution.\" He then elaborated on the two major achievements of the conference, namely, the formulation of the Program for Governance and the organization of the Northeast's unified highest administrative body, hoping that the representatives would implement these resolutions among the people. Regarding future work, Comrade Lin Feng suggested that in the coming year, the broad masses of suffering people should be thoroughly liberated. We must restore industrial and commercial construction and prepare for next year's great production campaign. He called for a thorough transformation of the old regime from top to bottom, the construction of a new order, initially achieving unified taxation, solving the national economic and troop supply problems, eliminating all impoverished people (missing number), eliminating the influence of all old ideas, and the bureaucratic system and bureaucratic style of the puppet regime. Finally, he pointed out that the day the Administrative Committee took office was the beginning of shouldering the heavy responsibility of seeking happiness for the forty million people, and therefore it must serve the people with utmost care. During free speeches, Mr. Che Xiangchen was the first to step onto the stage. He said: Personally, I am a non-partisan person, and my only belief is democracy, and I will not hesitate to sacrifice my blood and head for democracy. Comrade Wan Yi then, in his capacity as a veteran Northeast soldier, told the elders about the situation of wandering inside the pass for the past fourteen years, being oppressed and squeezed out by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and pointed out that only the Communist Party cultivated the outstanding children of the Northeast people. After \"August 15th,\" they sent them—Lü Zhengcao, Zhang Xuesi, Wan Yi, etc.—back to the elders of the Northeast to serve the people of their hometown. The speakers continued with Chen Yi, the General Political Representative of the Democratic United Army, and Wu Junyan, an old Kuomintang member. The conference closed after passing a temporary motion proposed by Mr. Chen Xianzhu, tasking the Administrative Committee with the responsibility of preparing to convene the Northeast People's Representative Conference.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北各省代表联席会议  历时九日胜利闭幕  行政委员会推举林枫张学思高崇民任正副主席  筹备召开东北人民代表大会\n\n1946-08-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北各省代表联席会议\n　　历时九日胜利闭幕\n　　行政委员会推举林枫张学思高崇民任正副主席\n　　筹备召开东北人民代表大会\n    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】（迟到）历时九日的东北各省代表联席会议，已于八月十五日胜利闭幕，行政委员会于同日召开第一次会议，推举林枫任主席，张学思、高崇民（民主同盟东北总支部负责人、安东省政府主席）任副主席。全体行政委员在闭幕典礼上隆重宣誓就职，同时热烈庆祝“八一五”东北人民解放周年纪念日。是日大会首由主席韩幼桐女士报告会前行政委员会第一次会议推举正副主席的经过，奏乐后，全体委员在正副主席领导下，举手宣誓就职。誓词如下：“余等誓以至诚，为东北人民服务，为争取和平民主建设繁荣的新东北奋斗到底，如有违反誓约，愿受人民制裁。谨誓！”大鼓掌声中，四位女代表向三位主席献花后，即由林枫同志致闭幕词。林枫同志首先热烈庆祝“八一五”东北人民解放一周年，当他提到十五年中牺牲了的东北抗日英雄民主联军以及一切东北人民时，激动的说不出话来。他继以昂扬的声音说：“我们为了纪念这些民族英雄，我们要下定决心，保持这个革命的果实。”接着他阐述了会议的两大成就，即制定了施政纲领，和组织了东北统一的最高行政机构，希望代表们把这些决议贯彻到人民中去。关于今后的工作，林枫同志建议，今后一年内，要使广大的受苦群众彻底翻身。要恢复工商业建设，准备明年大生产运动。他号召自上而下的彻底改造旧政权，建设新的秩序，初步作到统一税收，解决国民经济和部队供给问题，消灭一切贫民（中缺数字），肃清一切旧观念的影响，和伪政权的官僚制度与官僚作风。最后他指出行政委员会就职的一天，就是负起谋四千万人民幸福的重担的开始，因此要小心翼翼的为人民服务。自由讲时，车向忱先生第一个走上主席台，他说：个人是一个无党无派的人，唯一的信仰就是民主，为民主而牺牲，热血头颅在所不惜。万毅同志继以老东北军人资格，向父老们诉说过去十四年间流浪关内被国民党反动派压迫排挤的情形，指出只有共产党才把东北人民优秀子弟培植起来。“八一五”后，把他们——吕正操、张学思、万毅等送回给东北的父老，为家乡人民服务。继续讲演者有民主联军总政代表陈沂，及老国民党员吴俊彦等。大会在通过陈先舟先生提出之由行政委员会负责筹备召开东北人民代表大会的临时动议后闭幕。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 20th: This reporter visited Wang Yifang, the commander of the First Battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Regiment of the Nationalist Army, who staged an uprising at the Nanquan Station on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway on the 10th, withdrawing from the civil war. He recounted the uprising, saying: \"Our battalion has long been deeply dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war policy. This time, being sent to the front lines of Jiaodong to directly participate in the civil war, all officers and soldiers could not bear to harm our fellow compatriots. Therefore, at 5 PM on the 10th, we evaded the surveillance of special agents like Deputy Da Zhong, who were trained by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, and led more than 400 men in an uprising, opposing the civil war and entering the liberated area.\"\n\nHe then narrated that this special agent force was established in 1937 by the Military Intelligence Bureau under Dai Li as an \"anti-espionage\" \"Advance Column.\" After the signing of the army reorganization plan, Chiang, in order to cope with the continued civil war after the army reorganization and demobilization, combined the Advance Column, Commando Corps, Loyal and Patriotic Army, and some puppet troops into 18 columns, under the guise of traffic police, but in reality, they were responsible for \"suppressing the Communists.\" After the death of special agent leader Dai Li, Chiang gave a speech saying: \"Now I directly lead you. The only enemy in front of us is the Communist Party. You must work hard to剿捕and eliminate the Communist Party.\" \"You are my most trusted troops. I hope each of you can play the role of ten people.\" Chiang sent a large number of senior special agents trained by the Sino-American Cooperative Organization to supervise various places. In the First Battalion, there were six, including Deputy Da, who received secret subsidies from Chiang.\n\nWhen departing from Shanghai, the regimental commander summoned the battalion commanders and conveyed Chiang's secret order: \"Go to Jiaodong, on the one hand, to fight the Communists, and on the other hand, to monitor other National Army troops. Establishing merit and achieving success is now or never.\" After arriving in Qingdao, the regimental commander again said to the battalion commanders: \"The Eighth Army and the Fifty-Fourth Army are not doing well in the front. We are the most trusted of Chiang Kai-shek's most trusted troops, and we must complete our mission.\"\n\nAt this point, he exposed the crimes of Chiang and the US colluding to carry out an anti-people civil war, saying: \"Let alone anything else, the fact that the carbines and Thompson submachine guns we use are all supplied by the US military in Tianjin is enough to prove it.\"\n\nSpeaking of his impressions of the liberated areas, he said: \"What is most touching is the enthusiasm of the people in the liberated areas in welcoming us like relatives returning home. When we saw the people loving the Eighth Route Army like their own children, and the Eighth Route Army respecting the people like their parents, it reminded us of the people's past suspicion of us, and made us realize that only the people's army can have a close relationship with the people. We were even more envious of the united, well-fed, and happy life of all classes of people in the liberated areas.\"\n\nIn contrast, he lamented the dark crimes within the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the Chiang army. He said: \"The most heartbreaking thing in the Chiang army is that the medical supplies for wounded soldiers are embezzled by superiors, resulting in many lightly wounded soldiers becoming disabled and no one caring about them. Even someone of my rank would not be cared for if injured.\"\n\nOn behalf of all the officers and soldiers, he firmly stated: \"We are willing to work together with the army and people of the liberated areas to build a new China that is independent, peaceful, and democratic.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 交通警察大队长王一芳  陈述胶东起义经过  揭露蒋介石内战阴谋\n\n1946-08-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　交通警察大队长王一芳\n　　陈述胶东起义经过\n　　揭露蒋介石内战阴谋\n    【新华社莱阳二十日电】记者于日前往访十日在胶济路东段南泉车站举行起义退出内战之国民党交通警察第十五总队第一大队的王一芳，渠陈述举义经过称：本队对蒋介石之内战独裁深怀不满。此次被派至胶东前线，直接参加内战，全体官兵不忍自残同胞手足，乃于十日下午五时避开由中美合作所训练的特务大种副等的监视，率部四百余人起义，反对内战，开入解放区。接着他叙述这支特务武装系于二十六年由军统局戴立系所建立为“防谍性”的“挺进纵队”。整军方案签订后，蒋为应付整军复员的继续内战，遂将挺进纵队、别动总队、忠义救国军等，及部分伪军，合编为十八个纵队，以交通警察为名，实则担任“剿共”。特务头子戴笠死后，蒋曾训话称：“现在我直接领导你们，我们面前的敌人只有共产党，你们要给我努力剿捕和消灭共产党。”“你们是我最亲信的部队，我希望你们一个人能起十个人的作用。蒋派有大批由中美合作所训练的高级特务监掌各处，第一大队内就有大副等六名，彼等领取蒋之秘密津贴。由上海出发时，总队长曾召集大队长传达蒋的密令谓：“到胶东去，一面打共产党，一面监视其他国军，建功立业，在此一举。”抵青岛后，总队长又向各大队长说：“第八军及五十四军在前面打的都不顺利，我们是蒋委员长亲信之亲信，一定要完成使命。”至此，他揭发蒋美合谋进行反人民内战的罪迹谓：“别的且不说，单就我们用的卡趣式和汤姆式类机枪均系由天津美军供应一事，即足证明。”谈及对解放区观感，据他说：“最受感动的是解放区人民像欢迎亲人回家似的接待我们的热忱，当我们看到人民爱八路军如子弟，八路军敬人民如父母的情感，使我们回想起过去人民对我们的疑惧，并使我们知道了唯有人民的队伍，才能与人民关系密切。对解放区各阶层人民团结一致丰衣足食的愉快生活，更为羡慕。”在两相对比中，他慨叹国民党统治区及蒋军内部的黑暗罪行，他说：“在蒋军内最令人痛心者，为伤兵因医药被上级贪污以致许多轻伤员成为残废而无人过问，就是像我这样的阶级，一旦负伤，也不会有人理睬。”他代表全队官兵坚决表示：愿与解放区军民共同为建设独立和平民主之新中国而奋斗。"

In addition, over 300 mu of land belonging to military families lacking labor needs to be cultivated on their behalf. The whole village organized labor and livestock into shifts and groups for cultivation, ensuring that the grain harvest of military families is no less than that of the general population. Some villages have too many military families, and their difficulties cannot be fully resolved within the village. Neighboring villages have launched a loving mutual assistance movement.

This \"September 18th\" National Humiliation Monument was transformed from the so-called \"Spirit Pagoda\" built by the Japanese invaders by forcing the people of Qiqihar during the puppet Manchukuo regime. Today, in front of this building, the people of Qiqihar rejoiced for washing away fourteen years of national humiliation, and at the same time, they made impassioned speeches against another new national humiliation. The conference was held at 3 pm. Before the meeting, Yangko dances throughout the city began to promote the event. Trucks and more than 60,000 people from all walks of life crowded the streets, and every household was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. Men and women from within 20 miles of Qiqihar took cars to attend the meeting. On the field, red-tasseled spears of the Self-Defense Forces stood densely in a sea of people. After paying tribute to the martyrs of the Anti-Japanese War, Wang Shengrong, director of the Qiqihar All-Circles Federation, delivered the opening speech. In his free speech, Mr. Liu Chunqiao, an elementary school teacher, said: \"August 15th\" is the happiest day for us spiritually, but we have not forgotten those painful years of the past fourteen years. On the one hand, we thank the Democratic Allied Forces for cooperating with the Soviet Red Army to liberate the Northeast. At the same time, we must resolutely oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' betrayal of the country and dictatorial creation of a second \"September 18th.\" Shi Jianhan, a worker at Qiqihar's largest flour mill, said: \"Fourteen years ago, the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed us. The Democratic Allied Forces and the Soviet Red Army rescued us from the fire pit. Now the Kuomintang reactionaries are trying to push us into the clutches of American imperialist elements. We resolutely oppose this shameless betrayal!\" The conference ended and the parade began, with the procession stretching for five miles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 十四年来第一次欢欣  齐市人民纪念“八一五”\n\n1946-08-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　十四年来第一次欢欣\n　　齐市人民纪念“八一五”\n    【新华社齐齐哈尔十五日电】（迟到）齐市人民今日在“九一八”国耻纪念碑前广场，召开盛况空前的“八一五”一周年庆祝大会。此“九一八”国耻纪念碑，系伪满时日寇强迫齐市人民修筑的所谓“灵塔”改造而成。齐市人民今日在此建筑物前，为洗清了十四年的国耻而欢欣，同时为反对另一个新的国耻而激昂陈词。大会于下午三时举行，会前全市秧歌开始宣传，卡车及六万人以上的各界各业群众拥塞街道，家家张灯结彩，齐市周围二十里以内之男女群众，皆乘车赶来开会。全场上自卫队的红缨枪，林立在一片人海中，大会在向抗战烈士致哀后，由齐市各界联合会主任王盛荣致开会词。在自由讲话中，小学教员刘纯诮先生说：“八一五”是我们精神上最欢乐的日子，但是我们也没有忘掉过去十四年那些苦痛的岁月，我们一方面感谢民主联军配合苏联红军解放东北，同时要坚决反对国民党反动派卖国独裁制造第二个“九一八”。齐市最大的火磨工厂工人石健韩说：“十四年前，国民党反动派出卖过我们，民主联军及苏联红军将我们从火坑中救出来，现在国民党反动派又要把我们推到美国帝国主义分子的统治魔爪下，我们坚决反对这种无耻的出卖”！大会结束即开始游行，行列长达五里。"

Mr. Wang Gengwu, manager of Yu Sheng He, a general merchandise store in Nanguan, praised this bottom-up, free election as the first of its kind in Handan's commercial sector. The inaugural meeting was held at the Handan Theater. On that day, businesses throughout Handan commonly hung national flags, and merchants at the crossroads of the assembly site voluntarily erected arches conspicuously displaying slogans like \"Great Unity of Merchants.\" The 165 representatives in attendance included small merchants, small vendors, large capitalists, public stores, and private stores from all commercial sectors. Despite their different businesses and varying capital sizes, they all stood united on equal footing, electing their common leadership group—the Federation of Commerce—by secret ballot. Mr. Li Jirui, Mr. Wang Gengwu, and Mr. Zhang Jutian, the most reputable merchants, were elected as the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Federation. At the meeting, Mayor Wang, representing the government, congratulated the establishment of the Handan City Federation of Commerce, praising it as a new flower added to Handan's democratic construction. The shop employees' union also specially dispatched its representative, Gao Jinglu, to offer congratulations, hoping that the Federation of Commerce and the shop employees' union could unite and develop together in the future. Mr. Wang Mingke, representing all the merchants of the city, delivered a very emotional speech, saying: Today, we merchants can obtain democracy and freedom because of the support and leadership of the democratic government. He expressed his hope that the Federation of Commerce would lead the merchants to resolutely implement the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies. Finally, the General Assembly unanimously passed a declaration and telegram against the civil war, calling on all merchants in the border region to unite, resolutely oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' selling-out and civil war, actively support the patriotic self-defense war, develop industry and commerce in the liberated areas, resist comprador-bureaucrat capital and imperialist economic aggression, boycott American goods, advocate the use of local goods, develop handicrafts, organize transportation cooperative enterprises, stabilize prices, and welcome industrialists, business people, and unemployed merchants from the Kuomintang-controlled areas to operate and invest in the liberated areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 发展工商业实现商人大团结  邯市商联会正式成立  大会宣言通电反对蒋介石卖国内战\n\n1946-08-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　发展工商业实现商人大团结\n　　邯市商联会正式成立\n　　大会宣言通电反对蒋介石卖国内战\n    【本报邯郸讯】代表邯市商界三十七种行业、一千七百多户商号及千余家摊贩的商人联合会，经过三个月的筹备，及自由无拘束的民主选举，已于十八日正式成立。南关杂货业裕盛和经理王庚午先生，称誉这次自下而上的自由选举，是邯市商界开天辟地第一次。成立大会于邯郸剧院举行，那天邯市商家普遍悬挂国旗，十字街口大会场商人们自动扎起牌坊醒目的贴着“商人大团结”的标语。出席一百六十五位代表，包括了小商人、小摊贩、大资本家、公营商店、私营商店等一切商业部门。尽管他们业务不同，资本大小各异，但大家都同心协力的站在平等的地位，不记名的选举自己共同的领导团体——商人联合会。商人中最负盛誉的李吉瑞、王庚午、张聚田先生，被选为该会正副主席。会上王市长代表政府祝贺邯市商联的成立，称赞她是邯市民主建设中新增加的花朵。店员工会也特别派遣自己的代表高敬鲁前来祝贺，并希今后商联会与店员工会能互相团结，互相发展。代表全市商人的王明珂先生，极为感动的登台讲演，他说：咱们商人今天能获得民主自由，是由于有民主政府的扶植和领导，希望商联会领导商人坚决执行民主政府的工商政策。最后大会一致通过反内战的宣言和通电，号召全边区商人团结起来，坚决反对国民党反动派进行的卖国内战，积极支援爱国自卫战争，发展解放区工商业，抵制买办官僚资本和帝国主义的经济侵略，抵制美货，倡用土货，发展手工业，组织运输合作事业，平稳物价，并欢迎国民党统治区的工商业家及失业商人，来解放区经营投资。"

They rescued the wounded amidst gunfire and delivered food to them. Children and women from Beiguo and Xiguo in Wenxi, as well as male and female students from Jinnan Middle School, enthusiastically cared for the wounded day and night in field hospitals. From Xiguo, Beiguo, Weicun, Hedi, Hougong, all the way to Hengshui, comfort items such as watermelons, fresh fruits, meats, vegetables, eggs, fried dough twists, Rendan pills, towels, and soap were displayed as if it were a fair. In the hot sun, women and children waited by the roadside. As soon as stretchers arrived, they rushed to pour tea and water for the wounded, feed them food, and change their blood-stained clothes. In Wenxi County alone, comfort items included more than 200 fat pigs, more than 2,000 catties of watermelons and sweet melons, and more than 2,000 catties of dry cakes.

In the old areas of Wuxiang, Licheng, Pingshun, Shexian, Yushe, Zuoquan, and other places, cadres and masses are universally conducting current affairs studies, clearing up five incorrect thoughts: First, the thought of laying down arms for peace. Second, the Li Zicheng thought of personal enjoyment. Third, the paralyzing thought of underestimating the enemy and being complacent. Fourth, the pessimistic and disappointed negative thoughts. Fifth, the panicky wavering thoughts. Licheng and Wuxiang districts have successively held village cadre meetings. Everyone has cleared their minds and made historical recollections of their liberation. Many cadres, after recalling the two kinds of lives in the past and present, have been aroused to a high degree of anger and combat courage against the reactionaries' civil war offensive, which has been unprecedentedly enhanced. At the cadre meeting in Zhongzhuang, the key point of the Fourth District of Licheng, a challenge competition was launched to repair the cotton fields in the entire district within seven days, hoe the millet and corn, and prepare to participate in the war. After the village cadre meeting in the First District of Wuxiang, current affairs propaganda was launched among the broad masses. All villages restored their wartime command posts and displayed the combat style of the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Thirty-two women from Bai Village in Yushe voluntarily organized a women's defense army to stand guard, eliminate traitors, transport wounded soldiers, and entertain soldiers. All parts of Shexian are actively preparing to participate in the war. Nine women in Liujiazhuang volunteered to go to the front to care for the wounded soldiers. In more than ten counties including Changzhi, Heshun, Xiyang, Lucheng, and Wu'an, the peasants who have been liberated or are being liberated in the vast new areas, when they heard that the Kuomintang reactionaries were about to bring in the American reactionaries to invade the liberated areas again, were aroused to greater indignation. The masses in various villages universally conducted current affairs discussions and self-reflection on their liberation, and they demanded to be armed and go to the front line to defend the fruits of their liberation. The anti-civil war and self-defense patriotic movement has launched heated discussions in the families of the liberated masses. In Changzhi, Xiyang, Lucheng, Tangyin, and other places, many fathers and wives are letting their sons and husbands go to the village and district offices to ask to join the army. When Lan Xiao from Dongyetou in Xiyang discussed the reactionary attack on the liberated areas with his father, his father said: \"Don't worry about your mother's illness. She won't get better if you stay with her, and she won't die if you leave. If you don't go, she will die if the reactionaries come, even if she's not sick.\" An old man of forty-five and youths of sixteen or seventeen in Beijie Village in the county insisted on going to the front line. Because there were too many people asking to go to the front line, the county persuaded many youths to return to the village. Two hundred and eighteen people were persuaded to go back at one time, but these people were unwilling, crying loudly in a团 (tuán - group) and shouting that they had to go.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行各地翻身农民  积极准备爱国自卫战  老区普遍进行时事学习清醒头脑\n\n1946-08-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行各地翻身农民\n　　积极准备爱国自卫战\n　　老区普遍进行时事学习清醒头脑\n    【本报长治讯】在中国反动派依靠美国反动派发动全面内战的紧张形势下，太行全区由山地到平原，广大的新老区干部群众，掀起自卫爱国运动高潮。在老区武乡、黎城、平顺、涉县、榆社、左权等地干部、群众，普遍进行时事学习，清算了五种不正确的思想：一、和平了放下武器的思想。二、个人享乐的李自成思想。三、轻敌自满的麻痹思想。四、悲观失望的消极思想。五、慌乱的左右摇摆思想。黎城、武乡各区都先后召开村干部会议，大家清醒了头脑，作了历史的翻身回忆，许多干部想起过去和现在的两种生活后，对反动派的内战进攻，激起高度的愤怒，斗争勇气，空前提高。黎城四区中庄基点干部会上，展开了挑战竞赛，在七天内要将全区棉田修理好，锄完谷和玉茭，准备参战。武乡一区村干部会议后，在广大的群众中，展开了时事宣传，各村都恢复了战时指挥部，发挥抗战八年的战斗作风。榆社白村妇女自愿组织起妇卫军三十二名，站岗放哨、除奸、转运伤兵、招待军人。涉县各地都积极准备参战，刘家庄九个妇女自愿到前方看护伤兵员。长治、和顺、昔阳、潞城、武安等十数县，在广大新区翻了身或正在翻身的农民，当听到国民党反动派又要引上美国反动派来进犯解放区的时候，引起更大的激愤。各村群众普遍进行了时事讨论和翻身反省，纷纷要求武装上前线，保卫翻身果实。反内战自卫爱国运动，在翻身群众的家庭，展开了热烈的讨论，在长治、昔阳、潞城、汤阴等地，有许多父亲和妻子，相让着自己的儿子和丈夫到村公所和区公所要求参军。昔阳东冶头兰小与他父亲讨论到反动派进攻解放区的时候，他父亲说：“你不要顾虑你母亲的病，你在她也好不了，你走她也死不了，你要不去，反动派来了不病也得死。”县北界都村四十五岁的老汉，和十六七岁的青年，非要上前线去不行。因为要求上前线的人太多了，县里曾劝阻好多青年回村，一次就劝阻二百一十八人回去，但这些人都不愿意，大声小气的哭成一团，嚷着非去不行。"

    "content": "Happy Zhangwanfu Village\n　　Liu Baiyu\n    When I was in Beian County, Heilongjiang, I made a special \"rural visit.\"\n\n    I took a horse-drawn carriage through some meadows. The dense willow bushes were everywhere green. We went around a large bend along a ridge and arrived at Zhangwanfu Village. The old village consisted entirely of thatched houses. On the edge of the village, several farmers were building houses for themselves – red bricks and white wood. I immediately jumped off the carriage. A farmer standing on top of a wooden ladder happily said, \"We haven't gotten a piece of wood or a tile in fourteen years!\" Another said, \"Not to mention fourteen years, I never thought I'd see this in my whole life!\" Amidst the old, gray thatched houses, I discovered another house with a tin roof, already built, with delicate glass windows. The paint on the tin roof gleamed in the sunlight. Here I saw what true happiness is all about.\n\n    Zhangwanfu Village is a village of nineteen households. The village's Farmers' Association Director, Xiao Yuanqing, is an honest farmer in his forties with a face weathered by the elements. With a thick beard and pockmarked face, he wore a strangely short but well-made jacket. He told me... these were people who had come to Heilongjiang more than twenty years ago to escape famine, establishing a small village on the barren land. Later, more and more people came, and it developed. Everyone relied on their strength to cultivate the land and make a living... When the Japanese devils came, they gradually seized everything for the \"Development Group.\" They would only give you forty yuan for land that should have been worth two hundred yuan per mu (unit of area). From then on, none of the nineteen households in Zhangwanfu Village owned even an inch of land.\n\n    \"How did you survive then?\"\n\n    \"The Japanese then leased the land back to everyone, and they became the masters – besides paying rent, we also had to provide labor. Imagine, even if someone died, they wouldn't report the death for years, and we still had to provide labor for them! We suffered all the hardships in the world. We had to post a lookout at the door even to eat a little bit on the sly. Do you see how many Kwantung Army troops were stationed in Beian County (he pointed to a distant barracks)? They wanted calves and chicks; they wanted live chickens, which they would skin and store in icehouses.\" As he spoke, he led me into the village. Another farmer said to me:\n\n    \"Now Lao Xiao is the district Farmers' Association Director!\"\n\n    Suddenly, Lao Xiao pulled me to one place. It turned out that the two hundred-plus hectares of land around the village used to belong to the Development Group, but now it had all been distributed to everyone. Xiao Yuanqing's family received four hectares of land (ten mu per hectare). Now, he was building three new rooms in the center of his land, next to the thatched house he used to rent. Surrounding this house, both in front and behind, was the land he had been allocated. This way, when he lay in bed and opened his eyes, he could see his land. The house wasn't finished yet, but red paper with the words \"Auspicious Raising of the Beam\" was pasted on the beam. He pulled me to the front of the house and stood there, loudly asking me to take a picture of him. While adjusting the camera, I clearly saw Lao Xiao's face, and every deep wrinkle, filled with the hardships of life, was now trembling slightly with excitement.\n\n    I asked him.\n\n    \"Zhangwanfu Village has two hundred hectares of land, but how can you all cultivate it?\"\n\n    Because I had always doubted this problem, whether distributing land to the poor could solve the problem. Because as far as I knew, the soil in the Northeast is colloidal and very easy to solidify. Even ordinary cultivated land requires three animals to pull a plow in the spring, and in this area, over sixty percent of poor farmers do not have livestock. But Zhangwanfu Village once again proved the creative ability of people. Within a month of the land being distributed, all the land was planted. It turned out that after the land was distributed, the entire village was extremely enthusiastic. Under the leadership of Farmers' Association Director Xiao Yuanqing, they immediately pooled all the livestock and cultivated all two hundred hectares of land.\n\n    I asked: \"If this is the case, the land of those who have livestock is cultivated, wouldn't it delay the farming season for those who don't have livestock?\"\n\n    \"No!\" Xiao Yuanqing resolutely replied. \"We cultivate a part of the land for those who have livestock and a part of the land for those who don't have livestock. The crops are planted at different times, so we can ensure that no one is delayed.\"\n\n    Behind the village, I discovered a dwelling for poor farmers, two small mud houses housing three families. In the past, farmers couldn't afford to rent a room, so they rented a bed platform; if they couldn't afford to rent a bed platform, they rented half a bed platform. The misery of the farmers' lives can be imagined. The principle of land distribution in Zhangwanfu Village is that whoever lives in front of the land gets to farm it. Currently, ten households in the village are building new houses, and a new rural area is taking shape. Hunger, cold, and oppression will disappear here. What could be happier than this?\n\n    Finally, on the street, an old man with a black beard who sold his labor mumbled to me: \"My family is in the street,\" (referring to Beian) \"I don't have a share of the land here, but I think I'll just stay here. I want them to write my name down...\" I could see how purely the laborers loved the land.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 快乐的张万福屯\n刘白羽\n1946-08-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　快乐的张万福屯\n　　刘白羽\n    在黑龙江北安县的时候，我专门作了一次“农村访问”。\n    我坐了马车走过一些草甸子，丛生的柳条处处是绿色，沿着一条岗子绕了一个大湾，到了张万福屯。旧的村庄，一排全是草房，在村庄边沿上几个农民正在为自己建筑房屋——红砖白木料。我立刻从车上跳下来，一个立在木梯顶上的农民高兴的说：“十四年没得到一块木料一块瓦呀！”另一个说：“不要说十四年，长这样大也没想到啊！”在灰旧的草屋中间，我发现另外一处用铁皮做顶的家屋，已盖好了，很精巧的玻璃窗，太阳光里铁皮上的油漆发着光，在这里我看到真正的快乐是怎样一回事了。\n    张万福屯是一个十九户的村庄。村的农会主任肖元庆一个四十几岁风霜满面的诚实农民。丛生着须子、痧眼，穿一件短小得奇怪而质料很好的衣服。他告诉我……这是二十多年前早到黑龙江来逃荒的人，在荒地上建立的一个小村庄，后来人愈来愈多就发展起来了。大家都靠力气开地过日子，……日本鬼子来了，慢慢这里所有的都给“开拓团”强占去了。应该二百元一亩只给你四十元，张万福屯十九户人家从此没有一个再有一寸地。\n    “那怎么活下去呢”？\n    “日本人再把地租佃给大家，他们便作主人——我们除了交租之外，还要出荷，你想想人死了几年报不上死亡，还是一样出荷！我们算是受尽了人世间的苦难。偷偷吃一点，还得在门口放个哨。你瞧，这北安县驻了多少关东军（他指着远远一片兵营）？他们要小牛、小鸡，鸡要活的送去，他们把鸡肉剥下来送到冰房里去存起来。”一面说着他领我走进屯子里头来。另一个农民对我说：\n    “现在老肖是区农会主任呢！”\n    突然老肖把我一拉，拉到一处。原来这屯周围二百多垧地，都是开拓团地，现在一下又分配给大家了。肖元庆一家分到了四垧地（每垧十亩），现在他就在他的地中央，原来租住的草房一边，盖起三间新房屋来。绕着这房屋，房前房后都是他分到的土地，这样他躺在炕上一睁眼，就能看到他的地。房子还没盖完，梁上贴着红纸“上梁大吉”。他把我拉到房前面，自己站在那里，高声的叫我给他照一张像片。在照像机对光的时候，我清晰的看到老肖的脸，那每一条深深的盛满风霜的皱纹，现在兴奋得在微微的颤动。\n    是我问他。\n    “张万福屯二百垧地，可是你们怎样种得上呢？”\n    因为我一直怀疑这一个问题，就是土地分到穷人手里是否能解决问题。因为据我所知，东北土壤是胶质的，极易凝固，就是普通熟地，春耕也必须三匹牲口拉犁，而这一带是百分之六十几贫苦农民都没有牲口。可是张万福屯又一度证明人的创造能力。全部土地分配后，一个月所有土地都种上了。原来分配土地后，全屯热情极高，在农会主任肖元庆领导之下，马上把所有牲口拉在一起，把所有二百垧地都耕种了。\n    我问：“这样一来有牲口人家的地都耕了，没有牲口的岂不是误了农时？”\n    “不！”肖元庆坚决回答。“我们把有牲口人家的地耕一部分，把没牲口人家的地也耕一部分，庄稼下种有先有后这样就能保证谁的也不误。”\n    在屯后面我发现一处贫苦农人的住处，两间小泥屋，住了三户人。从前农人租不起一间房，租一铺炕，租不起一铺炕就租半铺炕，农人生活之惨可想而知了。张万福屯分土地的原则，是在谁门前的地就分给谁家种。目前全屯有十户上下都在建筑新屋，一个新的农村正在形成中。这里饥寒与压迫将绝迹，有什么比这再快乐呢。\n    最后在街上一个黑胡子卖劳动力的老年人喃喃对我说：“我家在街上，”（指北安）“这里我没份分地，可是我想就算这里的吧，我要让他们把我的名字写上……”。我看出劳动者是多么纯朴的爱着土地。"

Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Government personally attended and gave a report on war mobilization and organization. After analyzing the current civil war situation being frantically carried out by the traitorous bandits, Vice Chairman Rong pointed out: In the area surrounding our region, the Kuomintang's attacking forces have increased to 350,000 people. Kuomintang American-style aircraft are also carrying out brutal bombings against peaceful residents in Yongnian, Wenxi, Dongming, Jining and other places, and the flames of civil war of the traitorous bandits have rapidly expanded in our border area. Then, Vice Chairman Rong pointed out: In the Jinan and eastern Henan areas, the Eighth Route Army, forced to defend itself, has achieved brilliant victories. Comrades in the rear should recognize the seriousness of the current situation. The victory or defeat of this war is the key to determining China's destiny. Therefore, we must shatter the idea of complacency and carry out work and combat preparations intensively to support the front lines. We must know that only by organizing the manpower and material resources of the rear well and fully supporting the front lines can we smash the attacks of the traitorous bandits and reactionaries and realize the desire for independence, peace and democracy. At this point, Vice Chairman Rong loudly called on all cadres and 30 million people in the region to resolutely support the call of the CCP Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu Central Bureau to \"Oppose National Betrayal, Oppose Civil War, and Defend Peace\" and resolutely implement this call. He said: All sectors of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants in the region should be mobilized intensively and actively participate in the anti-national betrayal and anti-civil war patriotic self-defense war. The people and cadres of the entire border region should unite more closely, and expand this patriotic united front to the Kuomintang-controlled areas and Kuomintang soldiers engaged in the civil war in order to win over all forces opposing the civil war and jointly extinguish the flames of civil war. Secondly, we should mobilize young people to join the Eighth Route Army. All militia self-defense forces should learn from the heroic fighting spirit of the Pinglu militia in attacking the enemy and recovering the Zhang (Dian) Mao (Jin) highway, and widely carry out guerrilla warfare and sabotage warfare in the enemy-occupied areas and border areas of our region. Third, we should organize strong logistical work, improve the supply lines, ensure that the front-line troops have sufficient food and ammunition, rescue wounded and sick soldiers, strengthen the maintenance of rear order, and strictly prevent sabotage by traitors and spies. Fourth, continue to carry out liberation and production during the war. All work should be combined with the war, and everything should be subordinate to the front lines. Vice Chairman Rong finally called on the people of the entire region to immediately launch a warm movement to transport troops and comfort the army, and be responsible for solving all the difficulties of military families in order to relieve the front-line fighters of their worries.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 20th dispatch] The Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government's Vice Chairman Ji Fang, Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Provisional Assembly Vice Chairman Zhu Lvxian, and other representatives from organs, schools, and groups formed the Central Jiangsu Frontline慰問團 to go to various front-line areas to慰問 the brave self-defense New Fourth Army and the local people. After returning, they issued a report to all sectors in the rear, praising the rising morale, the people's spirits, the unity of the army and people, and the brilliant achievements of resolutely defending themselves, expressing full confidence in the final victory of the self-defense war. Finally, they called on all sectors in the rear to mobilize all forces to support the front lines in order to accelerate the arrival of victory.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 18th dispatch] The Frontline慰問團 led by Liu Shaobai, Vice Chairman of the Border Region参议会, and Sun Liangcheng, President of the Higher Court, carrying a large number of慰問品 and慰問 letters, set off a few days ago to the Lüliang and northern Shanxi front lines. This time, in addition to慰問ing the wounded and sick soldiers of the Eighth Route Army and the front-line fighters in the self-defense war, the慰問團 will also inspect the wartime medical care work, check the local work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, and the relationship between the army and the people in the area, and mobilize the masses to support the front lines to defend their homes.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 戎副主席号召全区干部人民  踊跃参加爱国自卫战  争取胜利坚决执行中央局号召  苏皖晋绥组织前线慰问团\n\n1946-08-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　戎副主席号召全区干部人民\n　　踊跃参加爱国自卫战\n    争取胜利坚决执行中央局号召\n　　苏皖晋绥组织前线慰问团\n    【本报邯郸十七日电】边区直属各机关干部千五百余人，十七日下午，于边府大礼堂举行“反对卖国、坚持独立，反对内战、保卫和平”的爱国自卫战争动员大会，边府戎副主席亲临作战争动员与组织的报告。戎副主席于分析汉奸卖国贼目前所狂热进行的内战形势之后，随即指出：在本区周围，国民党向我进攻的兵力，已增至三十五万人。国民党美式飞机亦对我永年、闻喜、东明、济宁等地和平居民实行残酷轰炸，汉奸卖国贼的内战火焰已在本边区迅速扩大。接着戎副主席指出：在晋南、豫东区域，被迫自卫的八路军，已取得辉煌的胜利，后方工作的同志，必须认识目前形势的严重，这一战争的胜负，是决定中国命运的关键，因此我们必须打碎太平思想，紧张的进行工作与战斗准备，以支援前线。须知只有把后方的人力物力很好组织起来，全力支援前线，才能粉碎卖国贼、反动派的进攻，实现独立和平民主的愿望。至此戎副主席大声疾呼，号召全区干部全区三千万人民，坚决拥护中共晋冀鲁豫中央局“反对卖国、反对内战、保卫和平”的号召，坚决执行这个号召。他说：全区工农兵学商各界，应紧张动员起来，踊跃参加到反卖国、反内战的爱国自卫战争中去，全边区的人民与干部更应亲密团结，并把这种爱国统一战线，扩大到国民党统治区与进行内战的国民党士兵中去，以争取反对内战的一切力量，共同扑灭内战烽火。其次，应动员青年子弟参加八路军，一切民兵自卫队，应学习平陆民兵，打击敌人收复张（店）茅（津）公路沿线的英勇战斗精神，在敌占我区与边沿区，广泛开展游击战争与破击战。第三，组织强力的后勤工作，健全兵站线，保证前方的军队有充足的粮食和弹药，救护伤病兵员，加强维护后方秩序，严防汉奸特务破坏。第四，在战争中继续进行翻身与生产，一切工作都与战争相结合，一切都应服从前线。戎副主席最后号召全区人民，立即展开一个热烈的输将劳军运动。负责解决军属一切困难，以解前线战士后顾之忧。\n    【新华社淮阴二十日电】由苏皖边区政府副主席季方、苏皖边区临参会副议长朱履先及其他机关学校团体代表所组成之苏中前线慰劳团，赴前线各地，向英勇自卫之新四军与当地人民慰问，归来后特向后方各界发表一个报告，对前方士气日盛，民心振奋，军民团结一致，坚决自卫的辉煌战绩，备加赞扬，对自卫战争最后必然胜利，表示充分信心。最后号召后方各界，动员一切力量支援前线，以加速胜利的到来。\n    【新华社兴县十八日电】边区参议会刘少白副议长、高等法院孙良成院长率领之前线慰问团，携带大批慰劳品与慰问信件，已于日前启程分赴吕梁晋北前线。该慰问团此次除慰问自卫战中之八路军伤病员与前线战士外，并巡视战地医陪疗护工作，检查地方拥军优抗工作，以及当地的军民关系，并发动群众支援前线保卫家乡。"

The directly subordinate teams of the Fourth Military Sub-district began in late July, with all political work and administrative personnel participating in this movement. When the Fourth Military Sub-district carried out military training mobilization in late July, it conducted tests and mobilization of cadres on three major techniques. Every soldier has realized that hard training on the drill ground is also an effort to strive for peace. The civil war launched by the reactionaries has increasingly expanded. We should seize every gap, improve combat effectiveness, and be ready to give the attacking die-hard elements and puppet troops a painful blow at any time. Every soldier of the 44th and 43rd Regiments has put forward the four major guarantees of \"no asking for leave, no getting sick, studying with an open mind, and obeying orders.\" In order to quickly form a upsurge in the movement, the 45th Regiment also held a forum for the 44th Regiment's military training heroes and learning models to exchange experience and call on them to take the lead and help backward elements. The various units of the Third Military Sub-district started earlier, and the officers and soldiers have been working hard together, which has now formed a upsurge. The old heroes of the 44th Regiment's large-scale military training are playing a exemplary backbone role. The old soldiers of the 49th Regiment have all become little teachers. Old soldier Wang Hong practices bayonet fighting with new soldiers under the starlight every day, patiently correcting every movement for them. New soldier Liu Yongxian practices bayonet fighting against the grass target in the moonlight every night. Many military training models have emerged in various units. Wang Honglin, a 19-year-old top-notch sharpshooter of the 50th Regiment, has become a small teacher loved by the masses. Soldier Song Jinglu of the 49th Regiment insisted on going to the training ground even when he was sick. All units are working hard to strive for being a model. According to the winter of 1944 and the spring of last year, the Taihang troops held the first large-scale military training movement, which guaranteed the victory of the large-scale advancement in the summer of last year and the successive self-defense operations. During the large-scale advancement last year, the people enthusiastically joined the army, and the new soldiers in various units increased, which required extensive training. Since the ceasefire, the Taihang Military Region has been preparing for training while demobilizing, but the die-hard army's offensive has never stopped, which has greatly affected the training. Now that the civil war launched by the reactionaries has increasingly expanded, the military region has issued a training order, calling on the entire army to improve its combat effectiveness, defend the liberated areas, and strive for peace.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抓紧战争空隙准备自卫力量  太行三四分区部队大练兵  指战员情绪高涨三大技术普遍提高\n\n1946-08-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　抓紧战争空隙准备自卫力量\n　　太行三四分区部队大练兵\n　　指战员情绪高涨三大技术普遍提高\n    【本报长治讯】太行三、四分区各部队，在“保卫豫北准备自卫”的口号下，于上月底掀起了热烈的练兵运动。四分区直属队，于七月下旬即已开始，所有政工、事务人员都参加了这一运动。七月下旬四分区进行练兵动员时，对干部进行了三大技术的测验和动员。每一战士均已认识操场上的苦练，也就是对争取和平的努力，反动派发动的内战已日益扩大，应抓紧每一空隙，提高战斗力，随时准备给进攻的顽、伪以痛击。四四、四三等部队每一战士，均提出了“不请假、不生病，虚心学习、服从命令”的四大保证。为使运动迅速形成热潮，四五部队并召开四四年练兵英雄与学习模范座谈会，交流经验，号召他们带头，帮助落后分子。三分区各部队开始较早，官兵一齐苦练现已形成热潮，四四年大练兵的老英雄起着模范骨干作用。四九部队老战士都成了小先生，老战士王宏天天不明就与新战士在星光下刺杀，耐心为他们纠正每一动作，新战士刘永贤每天夜里个人在月光下对着草靶低声刺杀。各部队涌现不少练兵模范，五○部队十九岁的特等射手王洪林成了群众爱戴的小教员。四九部队的战士宋景陆，带病还要上操扬。各部队均在为争取模范而苦练。按四四年冬季及去年春季，太行部队曾举行了第一次大练兵运动，保证了去年夏季的大进军、与历次自卫作战的胜利，去年大进军时，人民踊跃参军，各部队新战士加多，极须整训，停战以来太行军区一面进行复员一面即准备整训，惟以顽军进攻从未停止，对整训影响甚大，现反动派发动的内战日益扩大，军区即发出整训命令，号召全军提高战斗力，保卫解放区以争取和平。"

On August 1st, the Yan army's \"Home Guard Regiment\" in Quwo City, numbering over 2,000, surrounded the villages of Mazhuang, Changcun, and Xiyang in our Second District. When over a hundred Yan soldiers rushed into Changcun and surrounded the village militia, seven or eight militiamen, while firing their guns, escaped over the wall. After leaving the village, they organized sniper fire along the eastern ditch, less than a hundred steps away, preventing the enemy from pursuing. At this time, the militias of Xiyang and Ying villages, as well as the rotation combat teams, also discovered the enemy situation. Upon leaving the village, they engaged the Yan army. Our district cadres, comrades Yang Yuxiu and Liu Zhenhui, led everyone to break through the encirclement and occupy the high ground south of Balizhuang. The enemy concentrated their firepower and fiercely attacked our position. When the enemy approached within 30 to 40 meters, the militiamen's volley guns rang out, instantly killing two and wounding two Yan soldiers. The militias of Yimen, Beidong, and Jibi villages all automatically went to assist, setting up north-south battle lines and launching eight charges. Because the enemy outnumbered us, they switched to sniper warfare tactics, attacking the enemy, shouting slogans, and holding on until 3:00 PM, at which point the Yan army collapsed and retreated. It is estimated that five Yan soldiers were killed and over thirty were wounded.

Although only one in eight union members is a communist, the Communist Party leads thirty of the forty industrial unions in France. Among them are the three largest unions: the Steelworkers' Union (over 890,000 members), the Construction Workers' Union (over 510,000 members), and the Railway Workers' Union (over 380,000 members). Six out of the three members of the French General Confederation of Labour are communists, and there are several sympathizers. The magazine also stated that the strength of the French Communist Party is not limited to trade unions and major cities, but extends throughout the country. In ninety-eight of the ninety-nine provinces in France (number missing), one district also has twenty-four branches. In 1936, that district only had two hundred party members, but last October it had more than one thousand. An even more shining example of the French Communist Party's organizational ability is Guéret and around Albi in southwestern France. A year ago, the peasants in and near this area did not welcome the Communist Party very much, but now they regard the French Communist Party leader Thorez as a savior.

In terms of air transport: an aviation industry conference was held last month. Based on the results of the conference, Minister of Civil Aviation Astakhov issued a report stating that the Soviet Union's domestic air routes are expected to increase tenfold by 1950, reaching 108,789 miles, while the United States' domestic air routes are 74,739 miles. Other plans for developing the aviation industry include accelerating the design and construction of new aircraft, building new airports, improving old airports, expanding radio and other related ground equipment for aviation, training pilots, using aircraft to eliminate pests, expanding the use of ambulance planes on major air routes, and adding aircraft that can operate around the clock in all seasons. This plan will open international air routes (before the war, Moscow had air routes to three regions in Europe). Famous aircraft designers such as Yakovlev are designing new aircraft to meet the needs of various plans. In terms of ground transportation: In 1946, 4.3 billion rubles were allocated to restore and rebuild railways. 1,100 kilometers of railways destroyed by the German invaders will be repaired, 1,300 kilometers will be newly built, 255 railway bridges will be erected over major rivers, 174 stations will be repaired and newly built, and 1,150 kilometers of railways will be electrified. Sixteen locomotive manufacturing plants and seventeen repair shops will be newly built. The construction of the Georgian Republic automobile factory is developing rapidly. By 1950, it will produce 15,000 vehicles annually. When its production capacity is fully utilized, it will produce 100 trucks equipped with 90-horsepower engines every day. The automobile factory is also preparing to open specialized schools, and a vocational school with 1,000 students has already been established. Several rows of four- and five-story Western-style buildings will be built near the factory to provide workers and their families with clubs, kindergartens, nurseries, shops, and hospitals.\n    In terms of repairing canals: The White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal (i.e., the White Sea Canal, also known as the Stalin Canal) was destroyed by the German invaders and was reopened on July 28 this year. The construction project of the Nevinnomysskaya Canal, which is 45 meters long, 4 meters deep, and runs through the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains, is nearing completion and will solve the irrigation problems of the Stavropol region.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联交通建设正在飞跃发展\n\n1946-08-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联交通建设正在飞跃发展\n    【新华社延安十八日电】综合报导：苏联正积极进行交通建设，航空运输方面：上月曾举行航空工业会议，民运航空部长阿斯脱科夫根据会议结果发表报告称：苏联国内航空线，至一九五○年可望增加十倍，达十万八千七百八十九英里，而美国国内航空线为七万四千七百三十九英里。其余发展航空事业计划，有加速设计及建造新型飞机，建设新机场，改善旧机场，扩充无线电及其他有关航空之地上设备，训练飞行员，利用飞机消灭害虫，扩大救护机之使用于主要航空线，增添一年四季日夜均行开驶各处之飞机等，此计划开辟国际航空线（战前莫斯科所至欧洲三个区域开辟有航空线）。著名飞机设计家雅考甫列夫等正在设计新型飞机，以供各项计划之需。地面运输方面：一九四六年拨出恢复及重建铁路经费数达四十三亿卢布，将修复被德寇破坏的铁路一千一百公里，新建一千三百公里，二百五十五座铁桥将在各大河流之上架设，修复及新建一百七十四处车站，并有一千一百五十公里之铁路将电气化，新建十六个车头制造厂及十七个修车厂。乔治亚共和国汽车工厂建设在勇跃发展中，至一九五○年将年产一万五千辆汽车，当其生产力充分发挥起来时，每日将出产配有九十匹马力发动机之卡车一百辆。汽车工厂并筹备开设专门学校，现已建立拥有一千学生之职业学校，工厂附近将建筑几排四五层的洋楼，供工人及其家属设立俱乐部、幼稚园、托儿所、商店与医院之用。\n    重修运河方面：白海通波罗的海运河（即白海运河，亦即斯大林运河）被德寇破坏，已于今年七月二十八日开放。长四十五米、深四米、纵贯高加索山麓原野的涅文诺米斯卡亚运河的建筑工程，已近完成，将解决斯塔夫罗波尔州的灌溉问题。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th—Moscow Radio commentator Masinu, commenting on China's national unification movement, stated: The Chinese reactionaries have always declared that their policy is to pursue China's unification and \"resolve political disputes through political means,\" but in reality, they are doing everything possible to wage a civil war, deliberately putting forward various unrealizable demands, and shifting their responsibilities onto the Communist Party. After detailing how the Kuomintang reactionaries undermined the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, Masinu pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries provoked a civil war even before the War of Resistance Against Japan had ended. However, this time, the Chinese people have the experience of two united fronts and the experience of ten years of civil war and eight years of resistance against Japan. Therefore, the reactionaries' activities have been opposed by the broad masses from the beginning, and the idea of national unity has penetrated deeply into the masses. Masinu stated: Now, the situation of 1935 and 1937 has occurred again. To deceive public opinion at home and abroad, the Kuomintang reactionaries have again declared that their policy principle seems to be \"to continue to resolve political disputes through political means.\" To this end, they have engaged in various tricks, shifting all responsibility onto the Chinese Communist Party and making unrealizable demands on the CCP. Chinese democrats have pointed out that the CCP has made great concessions each time for the sake of peace and unity, but the reactionaries' demands are limitless and would undermine the cause of national construction. Chinese democrats believe that in the War of Resistance Against Japan and National Liberation, the CCP and its People's Revolutionary Army and the Liberated Areas were the main force in the war and the reliable pillar of the nation. Similarly, in the current period of national construction and the implementation of the Three People's Principles, they will also become the reliable pillar of the nation. Masinu concluded: After a year of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people have entered a critical juncture of changing circumstances. The current issues are those of war and peace, democracy and dictatorship, national rejuvenation and colonial oppression. The rise of the movement against civil war and for national unity to strive for peace proves that the Chinese people have chosen their own path.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联马西努  论中国民族统一运动\n\n1946-08-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联马西努\n　　论中国民族统一运动\n    【新华社延安廿日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努论中国民族统一运动称：中国反动派一向宣布说他们的政策是追求中国的统一，并“以政治方式解决政治纠纷”，但是在实际上他们却尽一切力量进行内战，故意提出种种不能实现的要求，把自己应负的责任推到共产党的身上。马氏详述了国民党反动派如何破坏了第一次国共合作的史实后，指出抗战尚未结束国民党反动派即挑起了内战，可是在这一次中国人民已有了两次统一战线的经验，有了十年内战八年抗战的经验，因此反动派的活动一开始就遭到了广大群众的反对，民族团结的思想已深入到群众中。马氏称：现在又发生了一九三五、一九三七年的情况，国民党反动派为欺骗中外舆论，又声明说他们的政策原则似乎是“继续用政治方式解决政治纠纷”，他们为此作了各种狡计，将全部责任推到中共身上去，对中共又提出不能实现的要求。中国民主人士指出中共为和平与团结的利益，每次都作了很大让步，可是反动派的要求是远没有限度的，是会使建国事业受到破坏。中国民主人士认为在抗日解放战争中，中共及其人民革命军与解放区是抗战的主力，民族可靠的柱石，同样的，在现在建国时期实行三民主义的事业中，也将成民族可靠的柱石。马氏结论称：经过抗日胜利一年之后，中国人民又进入了时局转变的关头，现在的问题是战争与和平、民主与专政、民族复兴与殖民地压迫的问题，反对内战争取和平的民族统一的运动的兴起，证明中国人民已选定了自己的道路。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Military Reporter Commentary\n\n　　Chiang Kai-shek's Inevitable Defeat in the Civil War\n\n[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] A Xinhua News Agency military reporter stated: Apart from all the political and economic difficulties, Chiang Kai-shek has the following insurmountable weaknesses in military terms alone, which will inevitably lead to his disastrous defeat in the civil war: (1) The contradiction between strategic intentions and military strength. Chiang Kai-shek has great ambitions. He wants the Central Plains, northern Jiangsu, Chengde, Andong, Harbin, to open up the Jiaoji Railway and the Tongpu Railway, and also to open up the land military transportation line from Nanjing via Jinan and Tianjin directly to Changchun. However, his total military strength is only 91 armies, 253 divisions. Now, 204 divisions (85% of his total military strength) are投入into the civil war, leaving only 49 divisions to guard the homeland. These 49 divisions include 14 divisions against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, as well as the Sichuan Army, Yunnan Army, and Ma Bufang's army in Qinghai, etc. Therefore, the actual military strength left to defend the fifteen or sixteen provinces in the rear is only 29 divisions. Chiang's forces are short of troops and exhausted of reserves. Even under the circumstances of his complete主动 advancement, he is already overwhelmed and stretched thin. Once he encounters the self-defense counterattacks of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, he becomes even more at a loss. The situation on the Longhai Front and the Tongpu Front recently fully proves this point. (2) The contradiction between tactical requirements and strategic intentions. Chiang Kai-shek has set this tactical operational principle for himself: concentrated maneuver. But he wants so many places, his targets are so dispersed, and the time is limited so short, while the capital in hand is very limited. Even if he can temporarily concentrate a considerable superior force on a certain area, at this time, many other areas will be full of flaws, creating conditions for the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to maneuver and gain advantages, creating victories in self-defense counterattacks. When Chiang's troops enter the Liberated Areas to fight, not only are they unfamiliar with the geography, but they also face the resistance of the entire people. Taking the Yangtze River coast in central Jiangsu and the Jinzhong plain area as examples: In the areas occupied by Chiang's troops, guerrillas and militiamen cooperate with our regular army to attack and harass everywhere, making Chiang's troops surrounded by enemies on all sides, struggling to cope, and the military strength is becoming more dispersed, and the maneuverability of operations is also reduced. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"concentrating forces\" can only become a worthless dogma. (3) The contradiction between the Central Army and the \"miscellaneous troops.\" Whether in the War of Resistance or the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek has always put the non-direct troops, which he regards as \"miscellaneous,\" on the front line as cannon fodder to achieve his goal of eliminating dissidents. The experience of the Seventeenth Division in Henan is a typical example. In this so-called \"reorganization,\" Chiang Kai-shek dismantled the organizational structure of the \"miscellaneous troops\" so thoroughly that the division commander could not find the brigade commander, and the commander could not control the troops. And the so-called \"miscellaneous troops,\" whether the Northeast Army, the Northwest Army, the Yunnan Army, or the Sichuan Army, all have a glorious revolutionary history and fought bravely in the War of Resistance, which is much stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's direct troops who fled at the sight of the enemy in the Henan-Hunan campaign two years ago. Remembering the past and thinking about the present, who among the officers and soldiers of these \"miscellaneous troops\" is willing to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek, this dictator and traitor? (Number missing in original text). Chiang Kai-shek issued a series of three subjectivist orders. At the end of June, he wanted to annihilate Li Xiannian's troops within 48 hours. At the beginning of July, he decided (number missing in original text) to open up the Jiaoji Railway by August 15 and to open up the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Xuzhou to Jinan within two weeks... His subordinates knew that they could not achieve the tasks specified in the order in actual actions, so they had to adopt passive and怠工 methods to delay and搪塞 by claiming that the railway was not open and the enemy situation was unclear. However, once there is a setback, Chiang Kai-shek never knows how to \"blame himself,\" but instead shifts the blame to his subordinates, issuing reprimands in general orders at best, and dismissing and investigating at worst, and if it goes wrong, he ends up with his head in a different place. In the Central Plains War, Fu Yan, commander of the 72nd Army, and Song Ruihe, commander of the 66th Army, were both reprimanded in general orders for \"poor combat performance.\" Recently, Liang Hanming, commander of the 99th Army, and Ai Di, commander of the 92nd Division, were dismissed and investigated for the loss of the fishermen in northern Jiangsu. Even very senior commanders, such as commanders of war zones, cannot escape criticism. But if the \"leader\" himself comes to direct the battle, he will be even worse than those who have been reprimanded by him. There had already been a performance in the later stages of the Central Plains War. These situations naturally increased the dissatisfaction of his subordinates. Recently, war-weariness and anti-war sentiments are very high, and they have begun to渗透 from middle and lower-level officers to senior commanders. Xi Shengkai, deputy commander of the 92nd Division and major general, said: \"In this Yugou battle, participating in the civil war, as soon as the gunshots rang, my mood dropped to zero... When the order was chaotic, the guards asked me how to deal with it, and I ordered them to lay down their weapons.\" Despite Chiang Kai-shek's repeated appeals: \"Clarify responsibility and abide by discipline,\" the righteous actions of people like Gao Shuxun, Pan Shuoduan, Hao Pengju, Xi Shengkai, Liu Shanben, and Wang Haiqing, who either launched uprisings against the civil war or led soldiers to lay down their weapons, are increasing day by day. Even the first battalion of the 15th Transportation Column, which carries systematic transportation, also raised the banner of righteousness on the Jiaoji Railway. In addition, there are many tactical weaknesses. Because the division lacks justification and the soldiers lack morale, Chiang's troops are not good at bayonet fighting and night fighting, a point that even Bai Chongxi cannot deny. As far as American-equipped equipment is concerned, it should be an advantage, but in the hands of Chiang's army, it also produces weaknesses. The greater the degree of mechanization of weapons, the more ammunition is consumed, and the more necessary it is to have good transportation lines for mass supply. However, China has a vast territory and convenient transportation. When Chiang's troops enter the Liberated Areas to fight, Chiang's troops cannot use railways and highways due to the widespread destruction by the local people. And in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling area, although he has been calling for the restoration of transportation for a year, the transportation situation is still terrible. In addition, the weaknesses of unified command and internal strife are countless. The Xinhua News Agency military reporter concluded: Chiang Kai-shek knows neither the enemy nor himself. His desperate冒险 actions will inevitably lead to a tragic ending, which is predictable.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石进行内战终必惨败\n\n1946-08-23\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社军事记者评论\n\n　　蒋介石进行内战终必惨败\n    【新华社延安十九日电】新华社军事记者称：蒋介石除了一切政治经济困难以外，单在军事上就有如下无法克服的弱点，使他所进行的内战终必惨遭失败：（一）战略意图与兵力的矛盾。蒋介石的野心很大，他要中原、要苏北、要承德、要安东、要哈尔滨、要打通胶济路、同蒲路，还要打通南京经济南天津直达长春的陆上军事交通线。然而他的全部兵力不过九十一个军，二百五十三个师，现在以二百○四个师（即全部兵力的百分之八十五）投入内战，只留下四十九个师看管老家，这四十九个师包括在新疆对少数民族十四个师，也包括川军、滇军、青海的马步芳军等等在内，所以留防守后方十五六省中的实际兵力，只有二十九个师。蒋方兵力短缺，后备枯竭，即在他完全主动进兵的情形下，已经顾此失彼，捉襟见肘，一碰到八路军新四军自卫反击，便更加手足无措。近日陇海前线与同蒲前线的情况，就充分证明此点（二）战术要求与战略意图的矛盾。蒋介石给他自己定出这么一条战术作战原则：集中机动。但他想要的地方这么多，目标这么分散，时间又限得这么短促，而手中的资本却有限得很，即或能暂时对某一地区集中相当优势的兵力，但此时在其他许多地区就破绽百出，造成八路军新四军机动地取得优势条件，造成自卫反击的胜利。蒋军进入解放区里面作战，不仅地理不熟，而且所面临的是全民的反抗。以苏中长江沿岸和晋中平川地区为例：在蒋军侵占地区，游击队、民兵配合我正规军到处袭击困扰，使蒋军四面受敌，穷于应付，兵力愈加分散，作战的机动性也愈减少。蒋介石所谓“集中兵力”，只能变成一文不值的教条。（三）中央军和“杂牌军”的矛盾。无论抗战、内战，蒋介石都把他目为“杂牌”的非嫡系部队放在第一线当炮灰，以达到其消灭异己的目的。十七师在河南的遭遇，就是一个标本例子。在这次所谓“整编”中，蒋介石把“杂牌军”的编制拆得稀烂，东一团，西一旅，弄得师长找不到旅长，指挥官不能掌握部队。而所谓“杂牌军”，无论东北军、西北军、滇军、川军，都有光荣的革命历史，在抗战中曾英勇作战，较诸在前年豫湘战役中望风而逃的蒋介石嫡系部队要强的多，抚今思昔，这些“杂牌军”官兵谁又甘心为蒋介石这个独夫卖国贼作内战的炮灰（中缺数字）。蒋介石下了一连三的主观主义的命令，六月末是四十八小时内歼灭李先念部，七月初决定（中缺数字）又要限期八月十五打通胶济路，二周内贯通徐州到济南的津浦路……他的部下在实际行动中明知无法达到命令所指定的任务，只有采取消极怠工办法，以铁路不通敌情不明等等拖延搪塞。可是，一遇失利，蒋介石从来不知道“罪己”，反把罪责诿诸部属，轻则通令训斥，重则撤职查办，闹得不好落一个身首异处。中原之战，七十二军军长傅言，六十六军军长宋瑞河均被以“作战不力”罪名通令训斥。最近苏北渔民失利九十九军军长梁汉溟，九十二师师长艾地，均遭撤职查办，甚至很高级的指挥员如战区司令长官者之流，亦无法免受斥骂。但要“领袖”自己来直接指挥一下看，却要比那些受他训斥的人更加不行。中原战事的后期，已经有过表演，这些情形，自然更增加了部下的不满。最近厌战反战情绪很高，开始由中下级军官渗透到高级指挥官身上，九十二师副师长洗盛楷少将说：“此次渔沟战役中，参加内战，枪声一响，我心绪即降到零点……当秩序紊乱时，卫士问我如何处理，我即下令放下武器。”尽管蒋介石一再大声疾呼：“明责任，守纪律”，但如高树勋、潘朔端、郝鹏举、洗盛楷、刘善本、王海清等那样，或举行反内战的起义，或领导士兵放下武器的正义行动，正在一天天增多，甚至连载的系统的交通第十五纵队第一大队，亦在胶济路上高举义旗。加之战术上弱点很多，由于师出无名，士无斗志，蒋军不善白刃战和夜战，这一点连白崇禧都不能不承认。就美械装备说来，应该是个优点，但在蒋军手中，同时产生了弱点。武器机械化程度愈大，弹药的消耗愈多，愈须有良好的交通线来大量供应，但是，中国幅员辽阔，交通方便，蒋军进入解放区作战，在当地人民广泛破击之下，蒋军无法使用铁路公路，而在蒋介石的统治区，虽然他喊了一年恢复交通，交通情形还是糟得不堪。此外为指挥不统一，内部互相倾轧其弱点，可谓不胜枚举。新华社军事记者最后称：蒋介石既不知彼，又不知己，他的孤注一掷的冒险行动，必然遭到悲惨的结局，是可以预卜的。"

Our people—the Eighth Route Army—were about to capture the city, rushing over the blockade ditch on springboards amidst the rain of bullets. Li Yugui smiled as he thought about it, then jumped up and left.\n　　Li Yugui had more energy than usual, forgetting that he was a 66-year-old man. He walked around the village, then around outside the village, marking several large poplar trees in the river滩 as springboards for attacking the city. When our troops rushed over the large poplar springboards, only our troops could rush over the large poplar springboards. Every one who got through would make a flower bloom in our hearts—how glorious! Li Yugui returned home and found several familiar and reliable people to secretly discuss the matter of making springboards in a small house.\n　　“This is a big deal. If we make springboards, our people will be able to rush over them and capture the city.”\n　　“Right! We have to work on it day and night.”\n　　Li Yugui said with a smile, \"This matter must be kept secret, lest Zhang Conglong find out and be prepared.\"\n　　\"Right, it can't be. From parents to wives and daughters, absolutely no one is allowed to tell the truth.\"\n　　Everyone took an oath voluntarily.\n　　At dusk, nine dark shadows jumped over the ditch and crossed the 河滩. Saws rang out on the large poplar trees, \"刺啊擦啊\" (ci a ca a - onomatopoeia for sawing). Someone constantly looked east and west. The sound of the saws went from slow to fast, from fast to tight. Nine people's hearts were set on sawing down twenty-four large trees with one saw. Then with axes, they made twelve springboards, so that our people could rush over the springboards and take the city.\n　　It was midnight, and the dew had already fallen, wetting their pants halfway up. Li Yugui was, after all, getting old and also sick, so he felt a little chilly, but he stretched out his arms, stuck out his belly, supported his waist, and exerted himself like everyone else, trying to stop the chills in his body. Someone noticed and said:\n　　\"You rest for a while.\"\n　　\"What are you talking about!\" Li Yugui deliberately exerted a lot of strength. But the humidity was too heavy, and Li Yugui's stomach ailment flared up again, and his heart gradually began to ache, but he gritted his teeth. Later it became more severe, his stomach swelled up like a drum, and the saw handle often bumped into this \"drum\", but he still exerted force, and even wanted to use the saw handle to press the drum down...\n　　In one night, twenty trees were felled, then carried to the village, and they began making springboards during the day. Li Yugui's stomach ached more and more, and his belly grew larger and larger, but he still worked hard. When tired, or if someone shouted, \"How's it going, Old Li?\" Li Yugui would pat his belly and jump up, saying, \"It doesn't hurt anymore, it doesn't hurt anymore, let's work!\" In fact, his stomach was still aching intensely, and his belly was still painfully bloated.\n　　The villagers were discussing their strange actions, but no one could find out that they were making springboards for attacking the city. Hundreds and thousands of people would pass over the springboards and capture the city.\n　　As darkness fell, our troops passed through the village. The twelve springboards had already been made, and some were carried to the roadside. They seemed to be saying to the troops, \"Look, our springboards are made, go over them!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 跳板——洪洞人民参战故事\n金沙\n1946-08-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　跳板\n　　——洪洞人民参战故事\n　　金沙\n    坐在门前的李玉贵，灰白的头发，带黄的眼睛，枯瘦的双手，更加重了他的沉思。他在思想着一件事：从这里往西，穿过冯壁到玉峰山，县城将要炮火连天，咱们的人——八路军就要攻下城来，在弹雨中从跳板上冲过封锁沟。李玉贵想着笑了，又跳起来就走。\n    李玉贵比平日有劲头了，忘记了他是六十六岁的老人，在村里转了一圈，又在村外转了一圈，在河滩里号下几棵大杨树作跳板攻城。当咱的队伍从大杨树跳板上冲过去，也只有咱们队伍能从大杨树跳板上冲过去。冲过一个，咱们心上开一朵花，这多光荣。李玉贵回到家里，就找了几个熟悉可靠的人，来在一间小房子里悄悄的商议做跳板的事。\n    “这可是件大事情，作起跳板，咱的人就能从跳板上冲过去攻下城来。”\n    “对！黑明白夜要干的。”\n    李玉贵笑着说：“这件事情得保守秘密，怕张从龙知道了有准备。”\n    “对，这还不能。上至父母下至妻女，一概不准说出实情。”\n    所有的人自动发过誓。\n    黄昏，九个黑影子跳过水沟，穿过河滩去，锯子就在大杨树上“刺啊擦啊”响起来。有人还不时的东照照西瞧瞧，锯子的声音由慢到快，由快到紧，九个人心要一锯子伐下二十四棵大树来。又一斧子作起十二个跳板来，让咱们的人从跳板上冲过去拿下城来。\n    半夜了，露水已经下来，他们的裤子湿了半截。李玉贵毕竟上了年纪，又加有病，有些寒颤，但他把胳膊一伸，肚一伸，腰撑起来和别人一样的出力，竭力来制止身上的寒颤。有人发觉了说：\n    “你歇一会。”\n    “什么话！”李玉贵故意使出很大劲来。但是潮气太重，李玉贵的胃病又犯起来，心口渐渐痛起来，可是他咬着牙齿。后来更利害，他的肚子又胀大了，像一面鼓，锯子柄常常撞到这面“鼓”上，他仍旧用着力，还想依锯子柄把这面鼓压了下去。……\n    锯了一夜二十棵树伐倒了，又抬到村里，白天就开始作跳板。李玉贵的胃越来越痛，肚子越来越大，但是还一样出力干。在疲乏时候，或有人喊一声“老李怎么样？”李玉贵就把肚子一拍跳起来说：“不痛了，不痛了，来干！”其实胃还在剧烈的痛着，肚子还胀的难受。\n    村里人在议论着他们奇怪的行动，可是没有人能问出来是在作攻城的跳板。将有整百整千人从跳板上过去，攻下城来。\n    将黑的时候，咱们的队伍从村子经过，十二个跳板已经作起，有的抬在路边。他们好像向队伍说：“你看，咱们的跳板作起了，你们冲过去吧！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 19th: The Luzhong Military Region released over 250 Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers captured in self-defense battles, giving each person 1,000 yuan in legal tender for travel expenses. For those who were injured and had not yet recovered, the masses were mobilized to carry them on stretchers. Chiang's officers and soldiers thanked them repeatedly upon departure, expressing that they would no longer serve as Chiang Kai-shek's tools for civil war. These Chiang's soldiers mostly belonged to the American-equipped 73rd Army and were captured in battles around the Zibo mining area. Although the fascist elements within the Kuomintang can deceive their officers and soldiers for a time, once they come into contact with the people's army, they are shown to be weak and powerless in the face of justice. In the West Slope defense battle, Chen Lequan, the company commander of the Second Company of the First Battalion of the 577th Regiment of Chiang's 73rd Army, laid down his arms after being surrounded and hailed by the Eighth Route Army. Li Huiwen, the political commissar of the Eighth Route Army division, personally talked to them, analyzed the current situation, pointed out a bright future for them, and took care of their lives in every possible way. Chen Lequan said with emotion, \"The Eighth Route Army, from top to bottom, treats me so well that even my own parents could not take such good care of me.\" In the same battle, the platoon leader of the machine gun company of the first battalion of the same regiment was pressed into the rubble due to the collapse of the pillbox. A squad of Eighth Route Army soldiers immediately stepped forward to rescue him, warning each other, \"We would rather hit our own feet than injure the prisoner's head.\" After the platoon leader was pulled out, he continued to curse, but Li Xinde, the Eighth Route Army company commander, patiently explained the domestic situation to him, pointed out that there was no way out for the civil war, and the medical orderly kindly bandaged his wound. The platoon leader finally sighed in shame, burst into tears, and said with grief, \"We have been sold out by Chiang Kai-shek and mistakenly regarded the Eighth Route Army as the enemy. It's really too wrong.\" Another soldier of the same regiment, who was injured in the leg, was deceived by the reactionaries and took off his watch to give to Feng Jiayan, an Eighth Route Army soldier who was receiving prisoners on the front line, asking him to protect his life. Feng Jiayan politely declined and told him that the Eighth Route Army treated prisoners well and bandaged his wound. Deeply moved, he immediately dug out his hidden American rifle and handed it over to Feng Jiayan, saying, \"This is Chiang Kai-shek's gun for fighting the civil war. It will harm others and ourselves if we hold it in our hands.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鲁中军区释放俘虏  蒋军官兵临别时称谢不绝表示不再为蒋当内战工具\n\n1946-08-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鲁中军区释放俘虏\n　　蒋军官兵临别时称谢不绝表示不再为蒋当内战工具\n    【新华社临沂十九日电】鲁中军区释放在自卫战中擒获之蒋军官兵二百五十余人，每人发给路费法币一千元，对受伤未愈者则动员民众以担架辗转抬送，蒋军官兵于临别时均称谢不绝，并表示不再为蒋介石充当内战工具。该等蒋军多隶属美械化之七十三军，系于淄博矿区一带战斗中被俘。国民党内法西斯分子虽能欺骗其官兵于一时，但当其一经与人民军队接触，即在正义前显出脆弱无力。在西坡保卫战中，蒋军七十三军五七七团一营二连连长陈乐泉被围后，经八路军喊话而放下武器，八路军师政委李辉文亲自和他们谈话，分析目前时势，为其指出光明前途，生活上照顾得无微不至。陈乐泉感动的说：“八路军上上下下都对我这样好，就是亲生父母也不能照顾得如此周到。”同一战斗中，该团一营机枪连一排长，因炮楼倒塌被压入乱石中，八路军一个班战士当即上前抢救，互相警告说：“宁可砸着自己脚，可别砸伤俘虏头。”该排长被扒出来后，尚叫骂不绝，但八路军连长李心德耐心地为其解释国内形势，指出内战绝无出路，卫生员则亲切地为他包扎伤口，该排长终于连叹惭愧，抱头痛哭，并悲愤地说：“我们叫蒋介石出卖了，误把八路军当作敌人，真太不应该。”另一腿部受伤之该团士兵，因受反动派蒙蔽，将手表摘下送给火线上招待俘虏的八路军战士冯家言，要求保护其生命安全，经冯家言婉辞谢绝，告以八路军优待俘虏，并为其包扎伤口。因其深受感动，立即扒出其藏匿之美式步枪送交冯家言，并说：“这是蒋介石打内战的枪，拿在我们手里害人又害己。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 20th: After the Marshall-Stuart joint statement declared the mediation a failure, Chiang Kai-shek immediately issued a declaration of all-out civil war on the first anniversary of Japan's surrender. He deployed 85% of his total force of 253 divisions, or 204 divisions, into the civil war battlefield, intensifying the conflict.\n\n\tSu皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) Battlefield: In addition to the original attacking forces, Chiang's army has successively增来 reinforced eight divisions since mid-July and is actively attacking along the north, south, and west three fronts. On the southern front: On the 2nd of this month, after Chiang's army occupied Haian Town at the cost of 3,000 casualties, it continued to attack east and northeast of Haian with seven divisions, occupying several villages and towns such as Libao and Zhongxiachang east of Haian, extending to the coastal area near 栟茶镇. After the Eighth Route Army launched a counterattack starting on the 10th, it wiped out the entire New 7th Brigade (formerly the New 7th Division) and most of the 105th Brigade (formerly the 105th Division), capturing the New 7th Brigade Deputy Commander Tian Yuncong and 5,000 officers and soldiers, including 105th Brigade Commander Jin Ya, and killing over 3,000. After suffering this blow, Chiang's army is reorganizing, preparing to attack again. On the northern front: Chiang's army, centered on Xuzhou, is advancing on the liberated areas in multiple directions, in accordance with Chiang's orders. One route north is coordinating with the 97th Army in 临城 to attack Zaozhuang. Western front: Although the Chiang army that occupied Sixian was wiped out团 outside Sixian, it is still plotting a fierce attack.\n\n\tShandong Battlefield: The situation in southern Shandong is becoming increasingly fierce. After Chiang's army's 77th Army主力 occupied Hanzhuang, it is fiercely attacking Yixian in conjunction with aircraft, attempting to connect the 临城-Hanzhuang section with the 临城 garrison. Chiang's army's 37th Division, advancing east from Du'an (20余里 north of Jiawang), occupied the important town of Jiantou on the south bank of the canal and is now pressing towards Taierzhuang. Chiang's army's 8th Army主力, gathered on the Jiaoji Railway line, occupied the cities of Linzi and Guangrao and is planning to attack eastward along the Jiaoji Railway line (Guangrao city was retaken by us on the 13th).\n\n\t冀热 (Hebei-Rehe) Battlefield: In addition to the bulk of Chiang's army's 66th, 92nd, and 94th Armies, the 53rd Army, newly transferred from Guangdong, and a portion of the 62nd Army, transferred from as far away as Taiwan, have been增至 added to the Beining Railway area. Chiang's army, citing the 安平 Incident, is actively attacking Xianghe, Sanhe, and Baodi, intending to seize the above-mentioned areas as a preparatory deployment for attacking Chengde. After being阻击 blocked by the local Eighth Route Army, they are fighting across the Bei Canal. At the same time, Chiang's army's 13th Army on the 锦(州)平(泉) Road occupied Tianyi Station and other places and made probing attacks along the 叶(柏寿)-赤(峰) line. After being hit by the Eighth Route Army, they have retreated to Tianyi Station.\n\n\t晋南 (Southern Shanxi) Battlefield: Chiang Kai-shek has recently transferred troops from Henan and Shaanxi to cross the river to the front lines. Chiang's army's eight divisions are deployed and are attacking Houma from Wenxi, having already occupied Dongzhen.\n\n\tIn豫陕鄂 (Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei): The Chiang army besieging Li Xiannian's troops continues to intensify its encirclement and interception, disregarding the three-week ceasefire agreement by the Executive Headquarters. Chiang Kai-shek is simultaneously transferring troops from the forces encircling and殲滅 wiping out Li Xiannian's troops to reinforce the陇海 (Longhai Railway) front line. He is also transferring Hu Zongnan's troops and the original 14th Army stationed in Chongqing to encircle and attack the Central Plains troops.\n\nSince the middle of last month, Chiang's army has successively invaded and occupied eleven county towns and hundreds of villages and towns in the liberated areas, including Xiaoxian, Lingbi, Rugao, Tianchang, Sixian, Wuhe, and Haian in Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui), and Jiyang, Yidu, Linzi, and Guangrao on the Jiaoji Railway line (Jiyang and Guangrao have been restored by us).\n\nDue to Chiang Kai-shek's insatiable greed, after invading and occupying many places in Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui), the central Shanxi plains, and several cities on the Jiaoji Railway line, he continues to attack, the military and civilians in the liberated areas have launched a righteous self-defense counterattack, inflicting great losses on the attacking Chiang army. In the陇海 (Longhai Railway), southern Tongpu section, and Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) lines alone, 30,000 Chiang troops have been歼灭 annihilated, captured, or spontaneously laid down their weapons in the past ten days, and seven liberated county towns. If calculated since mid-July, Chiang's army has suffered a total of 130,000 casualties, accounting for one-fifteenth of its total strength. The Eighth Route Army on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) launched a counterattack starting on the evening of the 10th, successively liberating the five county towns of Dangshan, Lanfeng, Yucheng, Qixian, and Tongxu on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) and on both sides of it, as well as more than ten important towns such as Huangkou, Yejigang railway stations, and Zhuxian Town. More than 15,000 Chiang troops (including a part of Chen Cheng's嫡系 direct line部队 units with American equipment) were歼 annihilated and laid down their weapons. The central section of the陇海 (Longhai Railway) between 60里 west of Xuzhou and 20里 west of Lanfeng, a distance of more than 300里, is completely controlled by the Eighth Route Army. This battle delivered a punch to the vital points of Chiang Kai-shek's offensive system, causing Chiang Kai-shek to panic and transfer troops from other battlefields to reinforce the陇海 (Longhai Railway) front line. This greatly assisted the self-defense of the Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) military and civilians and effectively weakened Chiang's army's encirclement of Li Xiannian's troops. The Eighth Route Army in the central Tongpu section also coordinated with the militia to implement self-defense counterattacks, successively liberating the famous cotton and wheat producing area in southern Shanxi and the two county towns of Hongdong and Zhaocheng on the Tongpu Railway from the hands of the puppet army. By this time, the 110里 section of the Tongpu Railway from the bottom of Tan in Huoxian to Zhangbao north of Linfen is entirely controlled by the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army on the Zhengtai Railway also coordinated its attack in the middle of this month, liberating Chengjialongdi southwest of Niangziguan and Panshi West Station east of Yangquan from the hands of the Yan puppet army.\n\nThe people's militia and guerrillas in the entire liberated area are making every effort to defend themselves. After our army on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) launched a counterattack, the local militia actively cooperated in the battle, liberating Zhuxian Town on the 13th, and once raided the southern gate and airport of Kaifeng at night, shocking the Chiang army in Kaifeng. The militia and guerrilla warfare movement in various parts of Su皖 (Jiangsu-Anhui) has been widely launched. The three main Chiang army transportation routes of 苏中南 (Nantong)如 (Rugao), 如 (Rugao)泰 (Taixing), and 黄 (Qiao)靖 (Jiang) have all been destroyed by the militia. The Jingjiang column and the militia intercepted the invading Chiang army 20里 north of Jingjiang City, killing and capturing more than 200 people and seizing 17 ships. There are 10,000 militiamen in Xin County cooperating with the regular army in combat. In the Linfen-Quwo area of the Taiyue Second Military Sub-district, 5,000 militiamen automatically organized rotation teams to conduct independent guerrilla warfare on the 250里 battle line from Xiaxian to Hongdong. Conversely, the anti-war and厌战 war-weariness of officers and soldiers driven by Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war is increasing daily. In the past ten days, there have been many anti-civil war uprisings by Chiang's army. Jiang Jiabin, the commander-in-chief of the joint command of Xiayi, Yucheng, and Yongcheng on the陇海 (Longhai Railway) front line, led 5,000 troops in an uprising in Yucheng, sided with the people, and cooperated with the Eighth Route Army in combat. The first battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Corps of the Dai Li system in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, with 400 people, revolted against the civil war under the leadership of Battalion Commander Wang Yifang. Desertion and escape due to 厌战 war-weariness by Chiang's army soldiers are also occurring everywhere.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 七月中旬大举进犯解放区以来  蒋军损兵折将达十三万  解放区军民自卫作战情绪极高蒋军师出无名厌战起义者日增\n\n1946-08-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　七月中旬大举进犯解放区以来\n　　蒋军损兵折将达十三万\n　　解放区军民自卫作战情绪极高蒋军师出无名厌战起义者日增\n    【新华社延安二十日电】马、司联合声明宣告调停失败，蒋介石紧接着于日本投降一周年发表宣布全面内战文告，采取总兵力二五三个师的百分之八十五，即二○四个师投入内战战场，战火愈演愈大。\n    苏皖战场：蒋军除原有进攻部队外，自七月中旬，又先后增来八个师，正积极向南北西三线出犯。在南线：本月二日，蒋军以三千人之损失侵占海安镇后，继以七个师之兵力，向海安东及东北进攻，侵占海安东之李堡、中下场等村镇数处，伸至栟茶镇近海一带。经八路军于十日起反击，歼灭其新七旅全部（原为新七师）及一○五旅（原一○五师）大部，新七旅副旅长田云从一○五旅长金亚以下五千官兵被俘，三千余人被击毙。蒋军遭此打击后，正重新整顿，准备再犯。在北线：蒋军以徐州为中心，遵照蒋之手令，分路向解放区进攻。其北进一路，正配合临城九十七军进攻枣庄。西线：攻占泗县之蒋军，虽在泗县外围被我歼灭一团，但仍阴谋猛犯。\n    山东战场：鲁南战况日趋激烈，蒋军七十七军主力于侵占韩庄后，正以飞机联合猛犯峄县，并图与临城驻军打通临城韩庄段。由杜安（贾汪北二十余里）东犯之蒋军三十七师，于侵占运河南岸重镇涧头后，正向台儿庄进逼。集结于胶济线之蒋军第八军主力，于侵占临淄、广饶两城后，正图沿胶济线向东进攻（现广饶城已于十三日为我克复）。\n    冀热战场：蒋军六十六、九十二、九十四三个军之大部外，新由广东调来五十三军，及远从台湾调来之六十二军一部，增至北宁路一带。蒋军借口安平事件，正积极向香河、三河、宝坻进攻，图夺取上述各地，以为进攻承德之准备部署。经当地八路军阻击，正在北运河对战中。同时锦（州）平（泉）路蒋军十三军侵占天义车站等地，并沿叶（柏寿）赤（峰）线作试探性进攻，在遭受八路军打击后，已退守天义车站。\n    晋南战场：蒋介石近从豫、陕各地抽调军队渡河开赴前线，该地蒋军八个师部署就绪，正由闻喜向侯马进攻，已侵占东镇。\n    在豫陕鄂：围攻李先念部之蒋军，不顾执行部中原停战三周的协议，仍继续加紧包围和截击；蒋介石一面从围歼李先念之部队中抽调一部增援陇海前线，一面又将胡宗南部队及原驻重庆之十四军增调包围进攻中原部队。\n    自上月中旬以来，蒋军已先后侵占解放区十一座县城及大小村镇数百处，其中包括苏皖之萧县、灵壁、如皋、天长、泗县、五河、海安及胶济线之济阳、益都、临淄、广饶（济阳、广饶为我光复）。\n    解放区军民由于蒋介石贪得无餍在侵占苏皖许多地方、晋中平川与胶济线数城市后，仍继续进攻不已，乃举行正义的自卫反击，使进攻之蒋军遭到极大损失。仅陇海、同蒲南段及苏皖各线，十日来即有三万蒋军被歼灭俘获或自动放下武器，解放县城七座。如以七月中旬以来计，则蒋军共损耗十三万人，占其总兵力十五分之一。陇海八路军自十日晚起举行反攻，先后解放陇海线上及其两侧之砀山、兰封、虞城、杞县、通许五座县城，及黄口、野鸡岗等车站与朱仙镇等重镇十余处。蒋军被歼与放下武器者共一万五千余人（包括一部分美械化之陈诚嫡系部队）。徐州以西六十里至兰封西廿里间三百余里之陇海中段完全为八路军所控制。这一战役对蒋介石进攻体系的要害上还击了一拳，使蒋介石手忙脚乱，从其他战场上抽调兵力增援陇海路前线。这样既大大帮助了苏皖军民的自卫、又有效的削弱了蒋军对于李先念部的围攻。同蒲中段八路军亦配合民兵实行自卫反击，先后从伪军手中解放晋南著名棉麦产区，同蒲路上之洪洞、赵城两县城。至此，霍县坛底以南至临汾张堡以北一百一十里之同蒲线全为八路军所控制。正太线八路军亦于本月中旬配合出击，从阎伪军手中解放娘子关西南之程家陇底及阳泉以东之盘石西车站。\n    全解放区的人民民兵和游击队正以全力进行自卫，陇海线我军实行反攻后，当地民兵即积极配合作战，于十三日解放朱仙镇，并曾一度夜袭开封南关及机场，开封城内蒋军为之震惊。苏皖各地民兵与游击队参战运动已普遍开展，苏中南（通）如（皋）、如（皋）泰（兴）、黄（桥）靖（江）三条蒋军主要交通公路线均被民兵破坏，靖江纵队与民兵曾在靖江城北二十里处截击出犯之蒋军，毙俘二百余，缴获船只十七艘。忻县有一万民兵配合正规军作战，太岳二分区临汾曲沃等九县有五千民兵自动组织轮战队，在夏县至洪洞二五○里战线上独立进行游击战。相反，为蒋介石驱作内战之官兵厌战与反战情绪日增。过去十日内曾有蒋军反内战起义多起，陇海前线夏邑、虞城、永城联合指挥部总指挥蒋嘉宾氏于虞城率部五千起义，站到人民方面与八路军配合作战。胶济路东段戴笠系之交通警察第十五总队第一大队，有四百人在大队长王一芳领导下反内战起义。蒋军士兵之厌战逃跑者亦到处发生。"

    "content": "Defending the Good Times of Happiness\n　　Seven Hundred Liberated Peasants Enlist\n　　Militia Members from Cishan, Yonghe, and Other Villages Enlist in Groups\n    [Report from This Newspaper] Under the call of the Central Bureau that \"all young and middle-aged people in the entire region should enthusiastically join the People's Liberation Army to ensure that the main forces are continuously replenished,\" seven hundred liberated peasants in Wu'an, with high enthusiasm, voluntarily requested to join the army. An old farmer in Sanxiaohe, over sixty years old, said, \"My family has just been liberated, we lack nothing now, we have land to cultivate, the cotton has been weeded five times, I can work, you go join the army,\" sending his only twenty-four-year-old son to the front lines. When Yang Tanbao from Hequ Village left to join the army, his wife saw him off, saying, \"Come back after defeating Chiang Kai-shek.\" Women in Fengdian Village mobilized men to join the army, saying, \"In the old days, you couldn't even sleep at home; this is going out to be a watchman, to protect us.\" Peasant Association member Su Yin, who threshed five shi of wheat this year after liberation, sent his son to join the army as soon as he heard about the civil war. The slogan of the youth in Baifu Village is: \"Young and strong, quickly join the army, don't delay a good future.\" At the anti-civil war rally of the people in Yicheng, they recalled that on July 14th of last year, the traitor Yang Sizi took away 143 people from the village, killing one, beating three to death, starving eight to death, and three went missing. It cost 3 million yuan and a lot of copper, iron, and tin to redeem 128 people. Everyone said, \"Yang Sizi is Chiang Kai-shek's man!\" Thus, a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army was ignited. Hao Ru from Beianle, who had just returned from Anyang, introduced that local bandits were everywhere in Anyang, and the exorbitant taxes were even worse than Yang Sizi, which angered everyone. Militia members from Cishan, Hecun, Nandashe, Taixian, Yonghe, Xiyangfan, Guaitoushan, and other villages all signed up in groups. More than twenty young women from Chengnan Township were determined to join the army, but were persuaded by the government to stay and work in the rear. The masses in Kangsu Village guaranteed that the families of those fighting the war would not have three difficulties: plowing the land, carrying coal, and fetching water. The Wu'an County Party Committee recently held a meeting to welcome and encourage Communist Party members who joined the army, to fight to the end to defend the people and defend the liberation. The leading experience of this enlistment movement is mainly: combining the liberation struggle with joining the army, combining current affairs mobilization with resolving ideological issues, creating a mass upsurge in joining the army. Practice has proven that the liberated peasants have a high degree of enthusiasm and determination to defend their happy life and to defend the border region by participating in the patriotic self-defense war.

    "content": "Saving Strength to Support the Patriotic Self-Defense War\n　　Taihang Administrative Office Orders Thrift Plan\n　　Jizhong Implements Thrift and Cleans Up Financial Affairs\n    [Reported from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Taihang Administrative Office, in order to promote the thrift movement, has formulated measures for thrift in the office, which will be implemented starting in the second half of August. The measures are: 1. Office expenses will be based on August as the standard, and efforts will be made to save half. Each department and section should make specific plans to minimize the amount of office supplies received and maximize the use of waste materials. 2. Food expenses will be reduced by 30%, and each person will save two liang of grain per day as stipulated. 3. Allowances for cadres will be suspended. 4. A reward and punishment system will be implemented, and public property savings will be shared according to the Teng Yang plan. In order to thoroughly implement this decision, the administrative office held a thrift mobilization meeting on the 13th of this month. Secretary-General Wu stated that the purpose of thrift is to reduce the burden on the people and save strength to support the self-defense war. He called for establishing a revolutionary household and developing a thrifty style. In addition, the Taihang Xinhua Daily is also practicing thrift, with the number of service personnel being reduced by half, the promotion of the use of waste materials, and the implementation of a savings sharing system.\n    [Reported from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Taihang Administrative Office held a financial meeting on the 7th, attended by the finance directors of the administrative office and the special districts, as well as the finance chiefs of Changzhi and Xingtai cities. The main content of the meeting was to review the financial work of the first half of the year and determine the work方針 for the second half of the year. The discussion focused on how to implement long-term planning and increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Director Li Yiqing pointed out in his opening speech that the achievement of Taihang's financial work was supporting the War of Resistance Against Japan for eight years, especially implementing Chairman Mao's \"give more, take less,\" organizing the masses to produce with 90% of the strength, enabling them to become prosperous, and then using 10% of the strength to do collection work, which made the collection work easy. He continued by pointing out that today we are in a tense period, and in order to support the self-defense war, in addition to increasing revenue, we should also plan for the long term, streamline and save, and called on financial cadres to strengthen their sense of responsibility and overall concept, consolidate finances, and overcome chaos.\n    [Telegram from Hejian, 19th] In order to fulfill the task of thrift and reduce the burden on the people, party, government, military, and civilian organizations at all levels in Jizhong, as well as village governments, have begun to universally carry out financial settlements and clean up household affairs. The cleaning items include savings, arrears, and public funds for organ production. The Eighth Commissioner's Office, district party committees, and other organs have cleaned out more than 25.34 million yuan in grain and funds. The cooperative of the Commissioner's Office has returned 4 million yuan in production funds and grain owed to the Commissioner's Office in one lump sum, and the Jizhong Administrative Office has also cleaned out more than 1.4 million yuan borrowed by the organ's production cooperative. Party and government organs in various counties generally start by cleaning up their own household affairs, followed by leading and supervising the cleaning up of public grain and property in various villages. After several repeated inspections, the Shenze County Government has cleaned out 1.69 million yuan in public funds from various departments and saved more than 6,700 jin of grain in food expenses. The key to the success or failure of the general cleanup of financial affairs lies in: 1. The responsibility of the leaders and the creation of a broad mass movement are extremely important, and the cleanup cannot rely solely on the general affairs department. 2. The registration and cleanup work should be based on mass opinions, starting with the most wasteful parts of the household affairs, so as not to form a decentralized focus and \"avoid the important and dwell on the trivial.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 储蓄力量支持爱国自卫战  太行行署订节约计划  冀中厉行节约清理财政家务\n\n1946-08-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　储蓄力量支持爱国自卫战\n　　太行行署订节约计划\n　　冀中厉行节约清理财政家务\n    【本报长治讯】太行行署为推进节约运动，已订出行署机关节约办法，自八月下半月开始执行。办法为：一、办公费以八月为标准，争取节约一半，各处、科应作出具体计划，尽量少领办公用具，尽量利用废物。二、菜金节约百分之三十，粮食每人每日按规定节约二两。三、干部津贴一律停发。四、实行奖惩制，节约公物按滕杨方案分红。为彻底执行这一决定，行署于本月十三日召开节约动员大会，武秘书长称：节约目的在于减轻人民负担，储蓄力量支援自卫战争。号召建立革命家务，养成廉朴作风。又太行新华日报亦厉行节约，勤务员已精简一半，提倡利用废物，并实行节约分红制。\n    【本报长治讯】太行行署于七日召开财政会议，参加者有行署财政处及各专署与长治、邢台两市财政科长。会议主要内容为检查上半年财政工作，确定下半年工作方针。讨论集中于如何贯彻长远打算与开源节流。李主任一清在开幕词中指出：太行财政工作的成绩是八年来支持了抗战，特别是执行了毛主席“多给少要”，以百分之九十的力量组织群众生产，使其发家致富，以百分之十的力量去做征收工作以后，征收工作即成为轻而易举的事。继指出：今天我们处在紧张时期，为支持自卫战争，除开源外，还应长期打算，精简节约，并号召财政干部加强负责精神与整体观念，整理财政，克服混乱。\n    【河间十九日电】为履行节约减轻人民负担，冀中各级党政军民机关及村政权，已开始普遍进行结算财政清理家务工作。清理项目包括节约，积欠及机关生产公款等。第八专员公署，分区等机关，已清理出粮款二千五百三十四万余元。专署机关合作社，归还专署一次拖欠的生产款粮四百万元，冀中行署亦清理出机关生产合作社借的款一百四十余万元。各县党政机关，一般先从清理机关家务着手，紧接着即领导督促清理各村公粮、财物。深泽县府，经几次反复检查，清理出各部门公款一百六十九万元，节约伙食开支合粮六千七百余斤。现初步进行清理的各机关，正深入动员全体干部，进行检查检举，以期彻底肃清财政开支中的浪费现象。一般清理财政家务的成败关键在于：一、首长负责，造成广泛的群众性运动极为重要，不能单靠总务部门负责清理。二、登记清理工作，应根据群众意见，先自家务中最浪费的部分做起，不要形成重点分散和“避重就轻”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: CCP member of the Executive Headquarters, Ye Jianying, received a memorandum from Kuomintang member Zheng Jiemin on the morning of the 19th, stating: Kuomintang troops will take free action against Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Yan'an to aid Kuomintang troops in the Datong area. The CCP side stated: Since late June, Chiang's troops have been attacking various liberated areas, occupying 20 county towns and 150 important market towns. Chiang Kai-shek has made five demands to the CCP: to cede the Jiangsu-Anhui border region, to cede the Jiaoji Railway, to cede Chengde and the area south of Chengde, to cede most of the Northeast, and to cede the areas in Shandong and Shanxi liberated by the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army from the puppet troops. Chiang Kai-shek's Lushan statement on August 13th openly supported these unreasonable demands. Since then, Chiang Kai-shek's deployment for an all-out civil war has become more active and specific. Zheng Jiemin, as a government member, formally announced the intention to attack Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Yan'an, confirming that the civil war has entered a larger-scale stage, which deserves serious attention from the people of the whole country.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Beiping Dispatch: At the Executive Headquarters meeting on the morning of the 17th, Fu Jiajun, the Kuomintang representative of the Military Mediation Department's Executive Office, openly declared: \"If the Communist army does not lift the threat to Datong, the government army will attack Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde.\" The CCP side stated: Chiang Kai-shek has投入85 percent of his troops into the civil war, and Chiang's troops are launching large-scale offensives against the liberated areas everywhere. Eight divisions of Chiang's troops, in violation of agreements, crossed the river and invaded southern Shanxi, advancing north along the Tongpu Railway, and have occupied important towns such as Wenxi,Shuitou, Dongzhen, and Houma. More than 500,000 Chiang's troops in northern Jiangsu have launched a large-scale offensive, advancing more than 100 li northward along the Yangtze River from Nantong to Taixing, successively occupying seven county towns including Xiaoxian, Lingbi, Sixian, Wuhe, Tianchang, Rugao, and Haian. More than 150,000 Chiang's troops along the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong have occupied nine county towns including Jimo, Jiaoxian, Yidu, Linzi, Zichuan, Boshan, Zhangqiu, Changshan, and Zouping. More than 200,000 Chiang's troops in the Central Plains tore up the ceasefire agreement reached by the ninth group and are pursuing and \"annihilating\" the breakout troops of Li Xiannian's command everywhere. Under these circumstances, the CCP cannot sit idly by and be destroyed, so it has to fight back in other parts of northern Shanxi to stop the ferocious flames of Chiang's military civil war. If Chiang's troops stop the offensive against the above-mentioned areas and withdraw from the occupied towns and vast areas, peace in Shanxi and the whole country should not be difficult to achieve immediately; conversely, if Chiang Kai-shek persists in his errors and insists on expanding the civil war, daring to invade Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde, then Chiang's side will be responsible for all consequences.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: General Li Xiannian's representatives, Zhang Wenjin and two others, rushed from their station to Xi'an a few days ago to negotiate specific implementation of the Laohekou temporary agreement with the Ninth Executive Group; unexpectedly, when passing through Yangpaomiao in Zhen'an County, they were suddenly detained by Hu Zongnan's troops of Chiang's side, and their life or death is still unknown. Chiang's side's move is to isolate Li Xiannian's troops from the Ninth Group, so as to undermine the Central Plains ceasefire agreement and implement its plan to pursue and annihilate the Central Plains troops. And the rumor that the Central News Agency has repeatedly slandered and madly clamored that General Li Xiannian did not send representatives to Xi'an has been shattered by the above facts. Regarding the unreasonable detention of Zhang Wenjin and others by Chiang's side, General Zhou Enlai of the Nanjing CCP delegation and Ye Jianying, member of the Beiping Executive Department, have lodged serious protests with the Kuomintang.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 公然叫嚣进犯延安张垣承德  蒋介石疯狂扩大内战  中共方面严正指出：蒋如执迷不悟应负责一切后果\n\n1946-08-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　公然叫嚣进犯延安张垣承德\n　　蒋介石疯狂扩大内战\n　　中共方面严正指出：蒋如执迷不悟应负责一切后果\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】执行部中共叶剑英委员十九日上午接获国民党委员郑介民备忘录一份，内称：国民党军队将对张家口、承德及延安采取自由行动，以援助大同方面国民党军队。中共方面称：自六月下旬以来，蒋军向各解放区进攻，已侵占县城二十座，重要集镇一百五十处，蒋介石向中共提出让出苏皖边区，让出胶济路，让出承德及承德以南地区，让出东北大部地区，让出山东、山西八路军新四军从伪军手中解放的地区等五项要求。蒋介石八一三庐山声明，又公开地支持这些无理要求。此后，蒋介石之全面内战的部署更加积极和具体化了，身为政府委员的郑介民正式宣布要进攻张家口、承德及延安，证实了内战已走上更大规模的阶段，值得全国人民严重注意。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】北平讯：军调部执行处国民党代表傅家骏，于十七日上午执行处会议上公开宣称：“如共军不解除对大同的威胁，政府军队将进攻延安、张家口和承德”。中共方面称：蒋介石已将其百分之八十五兵力投入内战，蒋军正在各地大举进攻解放区。违约渡河侵入晋南之蒋军八个师，正沿同蒲路北犯，已进占闻喜、水头、东镇、侯马等重要城镇。苏北蒋军出动大军五十余万，南线沿长江由南通至泰兴一线，已向北推进百余里，先后侵占萧县、灵壁、泗县、五河、天长、如皋、海安等七个县城。在山东胶济沿线十五万以上蒋军，已侵占即墨、胶县、益都、临淄、淄川、博山、章邱、长山、邹平等九个县城。在中原蒋军二十余万，撕毁第九小组获致的停战协议，正在到处追击与“围歼”中共李先念部的突围部队。在这种情况下，中共自不能束手待毙，因此不得不在晋北其他地方实行反击，以制止蒋军内战的凶焰。如果蒋军停止对上述各地的进攻，并撤出所侵占的城镇与广大地区，山西和全国当不难立即获致和平；反之，如果蒋介石执迷不悟，坚持扩大内战，胆敢向延安、张垣、承德进犯，则一切后果将由蒋方负责。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】李先念将军代表张文津等三人，日前由驻地赶赴西安，与第九执行小组商洽具体执行老河口临时协议；讵料行经镇安县之杨泡庙时，突被蒋方胡宗南部扣押，迄今生死不明。蒋方此举为欲隔绝李先念部与第九小组之联络，以便破坏中原停战协议，实行其追剿与歼灭中原部队的计划。而中央社所一再污蔑狂叫李先念将军不派代表到西安之谣言，已由上述事实击破。对张文津等被蒋方无理扣押事，南京中共代表团周恩来将军与北平执行部叶剑英委员，均已向国民党提出严重抗议。"

They decided to deepen the movement to thoroughly achieve \"Land to the Tiller.\" After half a month of intense and widespread liquidation struggles, the great ideal of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, \"Land to the Tiller,\" has achieved initial realization. Of the 300,000 mu of land seized and exploited by landlords in the past, 250,000 mu have been returned to the peasants. Generally, peasants have obtained three to four mu of land. This news is as gratifying as the victorious reports from the front lines of self-defense. The fundamental problem of land for the peasants, which has not been solved in rural areas for thousands of years, has been solved relatively quickly and universally in Wu'an this time. This is a major event of historical significance, both in terms of liberating rural productive forces to promote New Democratic construction and in terms of guaranteeing the crushing of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's offensive through the complete victory of anti-feudalism. The process of promoting land reform and completely eliminating the rule of landlords is the process of awakening and organizing the broad masses of peasants. It will enable the broad masses of peasants to vigorously develop production on their own land and promote them to consciously take up arms to fight to defend the fruits of their liberation. Facts prove that the peasants of Wu'an are already doing this.\n    The central task now facing the military and civilians of our entire border region is to mobilize all forces to strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. Vigorously promoting land reform and fully mobilizing the peasants' liberation is to lay a solid mass foundation for the self-defense war. We hope that all localities can be like Wu'an, boldly approving the demands of the masses in leadership, letting the masses rise up and do it themselves, resolutely, quickly, fiercely and universally igniting the fire of liquidation and revenge, and completing the unfinished great cause of land reform in history. Some places may be affected by the war, but they should also take advantage of the gaps, seize the opportunity, and vigorously promote this movement.\n    Since the Central Committee's Peasant Liberation Team went to the countryside in late June, all leading organs, schools, cadres, and students in our region have organized liberation teams to help the peasants liberate themselves, bringing the mass movement to thoroughly realize \"Land to the Tiller\" in our entire border region into a new stage. The movement is currently underway and has already achieved considerable results. This anticipates that this historical great cause will be completed smoothly soon. Only in this way can we completely crush the reactionaries' offensive and guarantee the victory of the patriotic self-defense war!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 加紧贯彻耕者有其田\n\n1946-08-24\n第2版()\n专栏：短论\n\n　　加紧贯彻耕者有其田\n    上月末，武安新区一千多翻身英雄、积极分子与模范干部，根据毛主席论联合政府中土地改革及孙中山耕者有其田的精神，进行全县翻身大检查，决定深入运动，彻底作到耕者有其田，经过半个月猛烈而普遍的清算运动，已使孙中山先生的伟大理想“耕者有其田”，获得了初步实现，过去为地主掠夺剥削所兼并占有的三十万亩土地，已有二十五万亩复归农民所有，一般农民都已获得了三至四亩的土地。这个消息，是和前线自卫胜利捷报一样的可喜。数千年来农村中未能解决的一个基本问题——农民的土地问题，这次武安是比较迅速而普遍的解决了，这不论就解放农村生产力以推进新民主主义的建设来说，不论就以彻底反封建的胜利来保证粉碎卖国贼蒋介石的进攻来说，都是一件有历史意义的大事。推行土地改革，彻底消灭地主的统治，这个过程，即是广大农民的觉醒与组织的过程，它将使广大农民在自己的土地上，大力发展生产，并推动他们自觉地扛起武器，为保卫自己的翻身果实而斗争。事实证明：武安农民现在已经这样做了。\n    现在摆在我们全边区军民面前的中心任务，是动员一切力量争取爱国自卫战争的胜利。大力推进土地改革，充分发动农民的翻身，就是给自卫战争打下雄厚的群众基础。我们希望各地都能像武安这样，在领导上大胆批准群众的要求，放手让群众自己起来干，坚决、迅速、猛烈而普遍地点燃起清算复仇的烈火，完成历史上未完成的土地改革的伟业。有些地方可能受到战争影响，但亦应利用空隙，抓紧时机，大力推进这一运动。\n    自六月下旬，中直农民翻身队下乡后，我全区各领导机关、学校、干部及学生均纷纷组织翻身队，帮助农民翻身，使我全边区彻底实现耕者有其田的群众运动进入一新阶段。现运动正在进行，且已获得了不少成绩，这预期着这一历史伟业将很快的顺利完成，只有这样，才能彻底粉碎反动派的进攻，保证爱国自卫战争的胜利！"

Today it has 30,000 members (only 5,000 in 1942). It is the third largest party in India. It is the only party that has achieved success in uniting Indian and Muslim masses in various political party organizations. It has a majority of seats in the Trade Union Congress and its main leadership organizations. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Trade Union Congress has grown from 196,000 members in early 1943 to 600,000 today, while the number of peasant association members has grown from 226,000 in 1942 to 830,000 in 1944.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Manila dispatch: Progressive people from the Philippine Communist Party, the Democratic Alliance, and other democratic groups are preparing for a mass rally to oppose the \"amnesty for political traitors,\" because recently some Philippine reactionaries and Filipino traitors have been advocating their so-called amnesty movement for political traitors, attempting to exempt all Filipino traitors from punishment and restore their anti-people activities. On the 18th, the reactionaries held a so-called mass rally in Manila to support the amnesty movement, attempting to create \"public opinion.\" The reactionaries attempted to mobilize 30,000 people to participate, but less than 2,000 people attended.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Manila dispatch: Felio, one of the leaders of the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army, sternly refused to hand over the weapons of the People's Anti-Japanese Army at the \"peace conference\" arranged by Interior Minister Sulute on the 17th. He solemnly stated: It is impossible for the People's Anti-Japanese Army to surrender its weapons; the victors should be the final winners. Since the liberation of the Philippines, the US-Philippine army and the Philippine constabulary have launched countless sweeps against the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army in central Luzon, all of which have failed. The Philippine authorities are still setting traps, wanting the People's Anti-Japanese Army to hand over their weapons and then allow farmers to participate in local councils; however, the People's Anti-Japanese Army pointed out that the reactionaries are stepping up their arms buildup in an attempt to eliminate the People's Anti-Japanese Army and seize the fruits won by the peasants in the anti-Japanese war. Therefore, the latter has no reason to surrender their weapons. The Philippine Interior Minister then invited the governors of the provinces in central Luzon (mostly representatives of landlords) and the leaders of the People's Anti-Japanese Army to hold this meeting in Malacañang, attempting to threaten the People's Anti-Japanese Army into unconditional surrender.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 印共深得群众拥护  为该国唯一能团结印回两教群众的政党菲共反对菲反动派“大赦叛国者”\n\n1946-08-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　印共深得群众拥护\n　　为该国唯一能团结印回两教群众的政党菲共反对菲反动派“大赦叛国者”\n    【新华社延安廿一日电】英共领袖之一杜德，在五月份的英国“劳工月刊”上著文称：印度共产党已成为印度工人阶级及有组织农民的不可忽视的领袖，今天它有三万党员（一九四二年只五千人），它是印度的第三大党，它是在各政党组织内团结印回两教的第三大党，它是在各政党组织内团结印回两教群众唯一有成绩的政党，它在职工大会及其主要的领袖组织中获有多数席位。职工大会在共产党的领导下，已由一九四三年初的十九万六千人发展到今天的六十万人，农民协会会员则已由一九四二年的二十二万六千人发展成为一九四四年的八十三万人。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】马尼拉讯：菲律滨共产党、民主大同盟及其他民主团体的进步人士，刻正筹备反对“大赦政治叛国者”的群众大会，因最近有一部分菲反动分子及菲奸，正在大倡其所谓大赦政治叛国者运动，图使一切菲奸免却惩处，并恢复其反人民活动。十八日，反动派曾在马尼拉召开所谓赞同大赦运动的群众大会，企图制造“民意”。反动派曾为此企图动员三万人前去参加，结果到会者不及二千人。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】马尼拉讯：菲人民抗日军领袖之一斐利奥，十七日在内长苏鲁泰布置的“和平会议”上，严词拒绝缴出民抗军的枪械。他严重声言：欲人民抗日军缴械乃不可能之事，应使战胜者为最后胜利者。按自菲律滨解放以来，美菲军及菲宪兵曾对吕宋岛中部的菲律滨人民抗日军展开无数次扫荡，结果均告失败。菲当局仍布置圈套，要民抗军缴枪后允许农民参加地方议会；但民抗军指出：反动派正加紧武装，企图消灭民抗军，套取农民在抗日中争得的果实。故后者决无缴械理由。菲内长乃约请吕宋中部各省省长（多数为地主代表）及民抗军领袖三人在马拉干举行这次会议，企图威胁民抗军无条件降服。"

    "content": "Criticism and Suggestions\n\n　　Some Opinions for the Post Office\n    Recently, readers and subscribers from various places have been writing to inquire about not receiving the books and periodicals they ordered (or receiving them very late). Sometimes we receive five or six such letters a day, which puts us in a very embarrassing position and subjects us to criticism. We would like to explain our distribution procedures: When we distribute our magazines, letters, etc., we check each household carefully to ensure accuracy, then register them in a delivery book and send them to the post office, where the post office stamps them as proof. However, the result is that they are not delivered to the readers. For example, a volume of books that we sent to the Taihang Xinhua Daily Issuance Section on July 22nd, following the same procedure, had not been received by the newspaper office by August 16th. The distance is only 70 *li* (approximately 35 kilometers), and it still hasn't been received after 26 or 27 days. Other readers, such as the Military Region's Civil Affairs Department, the Production Department, Li Cheng West Well High School, Zuoquan Second High School, etc., have sent many letters inquiring about things we sent out, which have not been received for two or three months. We have checked and rechecked, and our accounts and delivery books match perfectly. We don't know why things are always missing. We have raised this issue with the local post office countless times, but there is no solution. They say, \"Ordinary mail cannot be traced, and if it's lost, it's just lost.\" We said, \"In the future, we will send everything by registered mail.\" They said, \"That's even worse, there would be hundreds of registered items every day.\" There is really no solution, so we have to use ordinary mail. \"What happens if it gets lost?\" The answer is, \"There's nothing we can do.\"\n    Readers pay money and don't see the books, which we feel is really unfair. We send things out (books, letters, magazines), and readers don't receive them, and we have to pay a lot of compensation. Many people who want to read books are afraid to buy them from us. Originally, they planned to come here to buy them to get a preferential price and read them earlier. But because of transportation problems, they read them late or not at all, which makes some readers dissatisfied and even complain, saying, \"I'm not going to study anymore! ......\" We feel that we cannot continue like this in the long term! We sincerely hope that the responsible comrades of the post office will thoroughly inspect post offices at all levels and strive for improvement to meet the expectations of the public. Considering the work and our responsibility to the people, we frankly put forward these opinions and suggestions, hoping to see improvements soon!\n          Xinhua Bookstore New Masses Society Northern Magazine Society\n                            Children's Magazine Popular Science Society Mail Order Service Section\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 向邮局提一点意见\n\n1946-08-24\n第2版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n　　向邮局提一点意见\n    近来各地读者、订户纷纷来信询问，说收不到订购的书籍刊物（或收到的很晚），有时一天收到五六封这样的信，对我们提出很难堪的意见和批评。现将我们发行手续说明：我们的杂志、书信等件，向外发行，每次都是一户一户的查对无误后，登记送文簿送到邮局，由邮局盖章为证，但结果未能送到读者手里。如七月二十二日我们往太行新华日报发行科赠送的书一卷，也是经过同样手续，到八月十六日报馆还没收到，距离只有七十里路，二十六七天还没有收到。其他如军区民运部、生产部，黎城西井高校，左权二高……等许多读者来信询问，我们寄出去的东西，都是二三个月都不能收到。我们左查右查，我们的账和送文簿完全相对，不知为甚总是收不到，向当地邮局提过不知有多少次也没办法，说是“平件就不能查，丢掉也只好丢掉”，我们说“今后都用挂号寄吧”，他们说“那更不行，每天能有几百个挂号”，实在没办法，只好平件。“丢了怎办”？答说“没办法”。\n    读者拿上钱看不到书，我们觉着实在有点过不去，我们发出去的东西（书信杂志），读者收不到，我们赔的也不太少了。有好多人想要看书也不敢向我们买，本来打算来我们这里买想优待点，看的早点。但因交通关系看的晚、看不到，使一部分读者不满，甚至发牢骚说：“不学习了！………”我们觉得实在不能再这样长期下去！我们诚恳的希望邮局负责同志，对各级邮局切实检查，力求改进，以符众望。从工作着想，从对人民负责着想，我们率直的提出这些意见与建议，希望很快能看到改进！\n          新华书店  新大众社  北方杂志社\n                            儿童杂志  大众科学社    邮购服务股"

Xiao Ming, Director of the Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions, told reporters: In order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, a vigorous movement to practice economy, increase production, and support the front lines has been widely launched among the more than 20,000 workers in Zhangjiakou. Workers in various factories and industries are voluntarily requesting to contribute labor and funds to慰劳 the Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines. The Federation of Trade Unions has received more than 56.4 million yuan in donations from 16 factories, water carriers in the 6th district, shop assistants in the 2nd district, and others. Wang Zhenquan, a worker at the Xuanhua Xinhua Machine Factory, achieved the outstanding result of completing 52 hours of production tasks in 36 hours. Workers at the Jianguo Smelting Factory are voluntarily processing for one hour every day. Comrades such as Wang Fengshan and Feng Lianheng have all done five hours of work in one hour. The call in the editorial to \"pay close attention to developing people's power and pay close attention to thrift\" has attracted the attention of all cadres of the Border Region Administrative Committee. A unanimous resolution has now been made to save one or two liang of millet per person per day to aid the front lines, and to reduce financial expenditures through savings in various aspects. The document section plans to use accumulated waste paper for more than three months, which can save one million yuan. The Finance Department has decided not to collect paper and stationery within half a year, and will immediately launch a movement to clean up materials in various departments. Mr. Hong Ziliang, a Zhangjiakou city councilor and famous doctor, has suggested to the government that he is willing to voluntarily train rescue personnel. Major public hospitals in Xuanhua City have prepared the first batch of more than 500 beds to serve the self-defense war. Mr. Yun Ziqiang, a councilor from the Zhangjiakou education sector, suggested that current primary and secondary schools in Zhangjiakou should appropriately strengthen anti-fascist education, improve students' and the broad masses' understanding of the self-defense war, and cooperate in carrying out various wartime services in the rear. Party, government, military, and civilians from all walks of life in Chahar Province have jointly established a Self-Defense War Mobilization Committee, and decided to carry out in-depth self-defense war mobilization throughout the province, strengthen anti-espionage and air defense work, consolidate the rear area's public security, practice economy, eliminate all waste and extravagance, and fully support the front lines. More than 1,000 citizens in Xuanhua's streets and cities have organized a public security patrol brigade to assist the military and police in air defense and anti-espionage.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 张市各界响应解放日报号召  厉行节约增产支援前线\n\n1946-08-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　张市各界响应解放日报号召\n　　厉行节约增产支援前线\n    【新华社张家口二十一日电】延安解放日报十八日号召“全解放区动员起来粉碎蒋介石的进攻”的社论，已在此间得到行动的响应。张市总工会主任萧明语记者：为了粉碎蒋介石的进攻，张市二万余工人如火如荼的节约增产支援前线运动，已广泛开展。各厂各行业工人，自动要求献工、献金慰劳前方浴血作战的八路军指战员。总工会已收到十六个工厂及六区担水工人、二区店员等献金五千六百四十余万元。宣化新华机器厂工人王振权，创造了三十六小时完成五十二小时生产任务的卓越成绩。建国冶炼工厂工人，每日义务加工一小时。王凤山、封廉衡等工友，均在一点钟加工时间内作了五小时的工作。该社论中“十分注意发扬民力十分注意节约”的号召，已引起边区行政委员会全体干部的重视。现一致决议，每日每人节省小米一两援助前线，并从各方面节约减少财政开支。文书股计划将积存的废纸使用三个多月，可节省一百万元。财政处决定半年内，不领纸张文具，并立即在各部门中开展清理物资运动。张市参议员名医洪子良先生，已向政府建议愿自动义务训练救护人材。宣化市内各公共医院，已准备好首批五百余床位，为自卫战争服务。张市教育界参议员恽子强先生，建议当前张市中小学，应适当增强反法西斯教育，提高学生和广大群众对自卫战争的认识，并配合进行后方各种战时服务。察哈尔省党政军民各界，已联合成立自卫战争动员委员会，决定进行全省深入的自卫战争动员，加强防奸、防空工作，巩固后方治安，厉行节约，消灭一切浪费铺张现象，全力支援前线。宣化各街市一千余市民，已组织起治安纠察大队，协助军警防空防奸。"

Some special agent saboteurs spread rumors saying, \"This is terrible! The government will be even more suspicious of all merchants and will thoroughly defeat them.\" Individual merchants who did not understand the overall situation also spread unfavorable sentiments, saying, \"Han Xiuli is attacking commerce and bringing disaster upon us,\" and as a result, a small number of businesses transported and concealed materials. However, the government declined to accept Han's materials, and the masses only reasonably liquidated a very small portion, with the majority still belonging to Han. The government and the masses also encouraged him to invest in industry and commerce. This shattered the special agents' absurd rumors. Merchants generally believed that the democratic government's policies were genuine, and they voluntarily reported materials buried underground. In just the two days of the 12th and 13th, more than ten foreign cloth shops, silk shops, and general merchandise stores, such as Deyuancheng, Yuxinhe, Hengfengheng, Fulixiang, and Longji, reported more than 120 rolls of foreign cloth, dyes, bicycle parts, and many other items. Businesses with traitor materials or shares, such as Ruifengxiang Foreign Cloth Shop, Hengtaixiang, Huachangde General Merchandise Store, and Zhongheying Cigarette Shop, also voluntarily contributed over 500,000 yuan of capital held by traitors Wang Junqing, drug dealer Li Fu's, puppet police officer Jiang Tiyuan, and puppet Li Pinsan Self-Government Army Secretary Yang Wenxiang. It is reported that the government has issued a notice commending businesses that voluntarily report traitor assets and guaranteeing that their private capital will not be harmed.

    "content": "Wu'an After the Liquidation Movement\n　　The Principle of \"Land to the Tiller\" is Initially Realized\n　　Peasants Who Have Overturned Their Lives Buy Livestock in Succession to Prepare for Large-Scale Production\n    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] According to a report from Comrade Wang Tingdong of the Wu'an County Party Committee: After the large-scale inspection in Wu'an, 160,000 people in 243 villages in the new district launched a fierce and widespread liquidation movement in the first half of August. As a result of the movement, Sun Yat-sen's great ideal of \"land to the tiller\" has been initially realized. Of the 300,000 mu of land (approximately half of the total land) plundered by landlords in the past, approximately 50,000 mu were left to the landlords to maintain their livelihoods, while the remaining 250,000 mu (including the 200,000 mu cleared out last winter and this spring) have been returned to the peasants. In villages with a lot of land, such as Nan and Bei An'erzhuang, Shang and Xia Baishi, each person received five or six mu of land. In villages with less land, such as Dahezhuang, each person also received more than two and a half mu. In general villages, such as Boyan, Tonghui, and Shaozhuang, each person received three to four mu. Single men received especially more because everyone prepared for them to marry and start a family. Now the extremely poor stratum has been completely eliminated. The vast majority have become owner-farmers, while a few who are unwilling to farm use the money and goods recovered during the liquidation to engage in other production or run cooperatives.\n    During this liquidation movement, the peasants' slogan was \"Settle the general account with the landlords and thoroughly overturn our lives.\" Chengnan (South of the city) focused on settling accounts for labor and sweat (extra exploitation), while Chengbei (North of the city) focused on settling accounts for burdens to the enemy and puppets, and the liquidation was carried out universally. However, some cunning landlords pretended to be poor and desperately hid their property. Although the peasants repeatedly pleaded and reasoned, the landlords unreasonably delayed payment, which aroused the peasants' debt collection movement. Villages successively established committees for overturning lives and settling accounts, with 30,000 members of peasant associations (including female peasant association members) as the backbone, uniting all peasants to attack the feudal rulers. Before the action, more than a thousand cadres and activists conducted ideological self-examination, firming up their determination to eliminate feudalism, eliminate extreme poverty, and eliminate backwardness. Therefore, the broad masses of the backward stratum were drawn into the movement. Catholics in the Fourth District also participated in the movement, saying, \"The Communist Party is the true savior, Catholicism is not!\" Women poured into the ranks of debt collection, and children vigilantly guarded against stubborn elements who attempted to smuggle out supplies. Under the strong pressure of the peasants, many large landlords have taken out property to compensate the peasants. After receiving compensation, the peasants immediately used it to buy livestock (more than 20 households in the Xiwannian Village bought 22 head of livestock), establish cooperatives, and organize cotton ginning, oil pressing, dyeing workshops, and pharmacies. During the movement, some middle and small landlords voluntarily offered and returned accounts. The peasant associations adopted the attitude of \"If you are enlightened, we will take care of you\" towards those who were truly enlightened, and the method of \"Grasp the fake enlightened to expose his true stubbornness\" towards those who were falsely enlightened. With the consent of all middle peasants, struggles were also launched against individual traitors from the middle peasant class, and their lives were taken care of according to their degree of repentance. Chengguan (City gate area) launched a \"de-hatting\" movement for personnel of puppet organizations. Old servants and hired workers who had been oppressed in the homes of landlords and despots were also won over and joined the peasant ranks, helping to collect debts. Maids got rid of the abuse of the landlords' families and sought to marry peasants who had turned over a new leaf. Many poor dependents of martyrs, honored soldiers, and poor people in the old district also moved to the new district to settle down (more than 30 households were settled in Shangbaishi Village). The peasants excitedly said, \"We have completely overturned our lives!\" \"We will never live in leaky houses, with broken pots, and sick wives again!\" Now the county's militia has completed preparations for participating in the war, and some have already set off to support Anyang.\n    The main problems of the current movement are:\n    1. Rational distribution of fruits and realization of the \"leveling\" requirement. In the distribution of fruits, there are still deviations such as the masses being inferior to cadres, outsiders being inferior to villagers, the backward being inferior to the active, non-members being inferior to peasant association members, new members being inferior to old members, and individual accounting being inferior to collective struggle. Some villages also distribute according to the amount of work missed, or distribute equally regardless of poor and middle peasants. Some cadres even randomly draw, borrow, eat, drink, and waste the fruits of the struggle, which violates the interests of the masses. The broad masses demand leveling, \"leveling\" according to the degree of poverty, the amount of past gains, and current actual needs (distributing what is lacking), taking care of each other, democratic evaluation, and everyone comparing. This line is in line with the interests of the broad masses. Tonghui and Xiaohezhuang have created successful typical experiences. After the distribution of fruits in Tonghui Village, more than 40 poor, widowed, and orphaned households who could not work and produce established an old-age cooperative, with 900,000 shares already invested, and the peasant association allocated another 100,000 yuan as a subsidy fund, giving them long-term livelihood support. More than 20 widowed and orphaned households in the first street of Boyan have also collected 500,000 yuan in shares. This practice is being emulated in various villages. The Pingmin (common people's) Association in Chengguan put forward the slogan \"The fruits of struggle are blood and sweat, don't sit and eat, don't sit and wear, use it as a capital for large-scale production,\" which has been responded to by the whole county.\n    2. Overcome new complacency and carry out the movement of heroes of turning over a new leaf. Some cadres lost their specific direction in the heated movement and did not fully understand the complexity and arduousness of the movement. The Chengbei district prematurely shifted the focus of work to production, and the Chengnan district also wanted to take a breather. Reactionary landlords are plotting revenge. Yang Silou, a landlord in Tonghui, assassinated Shunyi's wife, an activist woman, and threw her into a well. Sun Caitang, a large landlord in Nanzhuang, fearing that hired workers would expose his darkness, threw the hired worker who had worked in his family for three generations into a well and killed him. In Shimen, Bate, Liuquan, Chegangkou and other villages, landlords and secret agents were found to have taken control of the militia, disbanded the peasant association, beat peasant association cadres, and plotted to riot. The county party committee has called for vigilance and a long-term struggle against feudal forces.\n    In fact, there are still some backward masses in various villages who have not been sufficiently mobilized. Although they have been involved in the movement, they are not conscious enough. It is necessary to advocate that cadres should be honest and patient, and check and help the masses to turn over a new leaf without leaving a single household. Do not only look at emotions, but sit down and want numbers. The county party committee has called on cadres to welcome the autumn heroes conference, strive to be heroes of turning over a new leaf, and the Eighth District has discussed specific standards and plans to carry out the movement of supporting cadres, loving the people, turning over a new leaf, and uniting during the Mid-Autumn Festival.\n    [Changzhi News] The people of the Third District of Wu'an, who have just turned over a new leaf, are now actively preparing for the large-scale production movement next year. In the movement of turning over a new leaf, they recovered more than 1,500 livestock from the exploiters. According to statistics from 40 villages (out of 42 villages in the whole district) in July, there were a total of 2,632 mules, donkeys, and cattle, almost 100% of which belonged to the peasants. In August, more than 300 head were added to the whole district. Xiwannian Village, with 110 households, bought 20 head in half a month. Nangang also bought six at a time, and other villages bought three, five, ten, or eight. A newly turned over household surnamed Zhang in Xiwannian said excitedly: \"Now I have land and a village house, and if I buy another animal, I can produce well next year, and my life will be better.\" (Shi Hong)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武安经过清算运动  初步实现耕者有其田  翻身农民纷纷买牲口准备大生产\n史洪\n1946-08-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武安经过清算运动\n　　初步实现耕者有其田\n　　翻身农民纷纷买牲口准备大生产\n    【本报特讯】据武安县委王庭栋同志报导：武安自翻身大检查后，新区二百四十三村十六万群众，于八月上半月掀起猛烈而普遍的清算运动。运动结果，已使孙中山的伟大理想“耕者有其田”获得初步实现。过去为地主所掠夺的三十万亩土地（约占土地总数之半），除五万亩左右留给地主维持生活外，其余二十五万亩（包括去冬今春清算出来的二十万亩），均已复归农民所有。地多的如南、北安儿庄、上、下白石等村，每人均获得五、六亩土地。地少的如大贺庄等村，每人也获得二亩半以上。一般村庄如伯延、同会、邵庄等，每人均获得三至四亩。光棍汉分得特别多，因为大家准备叫他们娶妻成家，现在赤贫层已完全消灭。其中除绝大部分变为自耕农外，有少数不愿种地的，以清算中收回之钱物进行其他生产或办合作社。\n    这次清算运动中，农民的口号是“和地主算总账，彻底翻身。”城南以算劳役血汗账（额外剥削）为主，城北以算对敌伪负担账为主，普遍展开清算。但有些狡猾的地主，一面装穷，一面拚命的隐藏财产；农民虽再三诉苦说理，地主却无理拖欠，于是激起农民的要账运动。各村纷纷成立翻身算账委员会，以三万农会会员（包括女农会会员）为骨干，团结全体农民，向封建统治者冲击。在行动前千余干部积极分子作了思想反省，坚定了消灭封建、消灭赤贫、消灭落后的决心。因此，广大的落后层都卷入运动。四区有天主教徒也参加了运动，他们说：“共产党才是真正的救世主，天主教不行！”妇女们都涌入要账的行列，儿童们认真地警戒着企图私运物资出走的顽固分子。在农民强大压力下，不少的大地主，已拿出财物偿还农民，农民获得赔偿后，当即用以买牲口（百余户的西万年村，已买牲口二十二头）、成立合作社、组织弹花、榨花、染坊、药房等。在运动中一些中小地主自动献出与清还账目，农会对真开明的，采取“你开明我照顾”的态度，对假开明的则采取“抓住假开明暴露他真顽固”的办法。个别中农成分的奸伪分子在全体中农同意下，也开展了斗争，并按他改悔程度照顾他的生活。城关开展了伪组织人员的“摘帽”运动。地主恶霸家里受压迫的老佣人、雇工等，也经过争取，纷纷投向农民阵营，帮助进行要账。使女们都摆脱地主家的虐待，找下翻身农民做结婚对象。老区不少贫苦抗属、荣誉军人、与贫民也搬到新区来安家（上白石一村安置三十余户）。农民兴奋的说：“翻身翻透啦！”“再不过漏房子、破锅、病老婆的时光啦！”现在全县民兵已完成参战准备，一部且已出发支援安阳。\n    目前运动的主要问题是：\n    一、合理分配果实，实现“填平”要求。在分配果实中还存在着群众不如干部，外来户不如本村户，落后的不如积极的，非会员不如农会员，新会员不如老会员，集体斗争不如个别算账的偏向。有的村还按误工多少来分，或不论贫中农平分。部分干部且乱抽乱借吃喝浪费斗争果实，这些都是违反群众利益的。广大群众要求填平，按贫苦程度、按过去得利多少、按现在实际需要（缺什么就分什么）来“填平”，互相照顾，民主评议，大家比较。这种路线是符合广大群众利益的。同会，小贺庄已创造了成功的典型经验。同会村在分配果实后，不能劳动生产的四十多家贫苦孤寡户，成立了养老合作社，已入股九十万，农会又拨出十万元作补助基金，使他们有了长期生活依靠。伯延一街二十多户孤寡也已集股五十万元。这种作法各村正在仿效。城关区平民会提出“斗争果实是血汗，不坐吃、不坐穿、作为生产大本钱”的口号已为全县所响应。\n    二、克服新的满足情绪开展翻身英雄运动。有些干部在热烈的运动中迷失了具体方向，对运动的复杂性艰苦性认识不够，城北区过早的转变工作中心为生产，城南区也想松一口气。反动地主正在阴谋报复，同会地主杨四楼将妇女积极分子顺义妻暗杀投井，南庄大地主孙才唐，怕雇工暴露他的黑暗，竟将三辈子在他家作活的雇工投井处死，石门、八特、流泉、车纲口等村发现地主特务掌握民兵、解散农会、打农会干部、企图暴动的阴谋，县委已号召提高警惕，与封建势力作长期斗争。\n    各村实际上都还有一部分发动不够的落后群众，他们虽卷入了运动，但自觉不够。必须提倡干部要老实耐心，一户不留的检查扶助群众翻身，不要只看情绪，坐要数字。县委已号召干部迎接秋后群英大会，争取翻身英雄，八区并已讨论出具体标准，拟于中秋节开展拥干爱民翻身团结运动。\n    【长治讯】新翻身的武安三区人民，现正为来年的大生产运动作积极的准备。在翻身运动中，他们向剥削者要回了一千五百多个牲口，据七月份四十个村（全区共四十二村）统计，共有骡、驴、牛二千六百三十二头，这些牲口几乎百分之百属于农民。在八月份，全区又增加了三百多头，百十户的西万年村，半个月就买了二十头。南岗一次也买了六个，其它各村，三个、五个、十个、八个不等。西万年一个姓张的新翻身户很兴奋的说：“如今我有地也有庄子了，再买一个牲口，明年就可好好生产，生活就好了”。（史洪）"

    "date": "1946-08-24",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The People Who Turned Over\n　　Cheng Fang\n\n　　In the height of summer, I arrived at Qingyan Temple, a remote village in the northwest corner of Wu'an County.\n\n　　The village's chest is adorned with shady green orchards and lush vegetable gardens, with a perennial stream flowing through it. Its back is closely nestled against layers of green fields. The pleasant mood and cheerful smiles of the villagers present a youthful scene of Qingyan Temple!\n\n　　During the busy farming season, the enthusiasm of the emancipated people for production is very high. They go to the fields to weed before dawn and do not return from the fields in groups of three or five, singing songs, until the sun rolls down the western mountains. As soon as they put down their rice bowls, they review the day's production. Although they are so busy, they do not show any signs of fatigue.\n\n　　One evening, I met the newly appointed village chief, Li Guorui. He has a very good understanding of the tragic lives of the peasants. During the rent reduction and debt liquidation movement in February of this year, he actively led the masses to settle accounts with the local tyrants and landlords, removing the thousand-pound stone slab that was pressing on the masses. At the village government re-election meeting in April, the whole village unanimously elected him as the village chief, supporting him to work for them. Now he happily sings about the great emancipation of the people:\n\n　　\"On the thirteenth of February,\n　　The rent reduction movement was in full swing,\n　　The tenants, held a meeting,\n　　Complained of their sufferings and aired their grievances,\n　　Overthrowing feudal heavy exploitation,\n　　And lifting this big stone slab!\n　　Redeemed the estates and took back the land,\n　　Then harvested a good May crop,\n　　Improving the lives of every household;\n　　Mutual aid production is not difficult,\n　　Organized together to work with one heart!\"\n\n　　Indeed, the thirteenth of February, this day of emancipation, is forever unforgettable in the hearts of the folks in Qingyan Temple. On this day, Worker Wang from the district led the tenants to hold an emancipation meeting. At the meeting, Old Lady Wang tearfully recounted the tragic situation of her husband being forced to death by the landlord Wang Xingde. She said, \"Our family was forced to beg for food by Wang Xingde. His father wanted an ear of sorghum, but Wang Xingde insisted that he stole it from him, fined us in the village, and sent him to Wu'an City to be imprisoned. His father died in prison like that....\" She suffered a relapse of her long-standing heartache while recounting, and lost her voice and fell to the ground. \"How many good people like this have been killed by man-eating evil landlords!\" Angry voices and tears of sympathy were heard throughout the venue, igniting the flames of revenge. After this rent reduction and grievance meeting, the tenants lifted the stone slab, turned over, had land to cultivate, had good houses to live in, and spent this good May of this year. Really, thinking about the past and looking at the present, how could they not be happy!\n\n　　Liu Shouxiang, the vice chairman of the farmers' association, was a long-term worker for more than thirty years who had suffered greatly. In his past life, he had experienced the hardships of the world and suffered all kinds of sorrows and pains. Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army, he has been freed from his life as a long-term worker and established his own family. After this year's rent reduction movement, he truly turned over, acquired an estate, and bought land. In May, he harvested more than four stones of wheat, leaping from extreme poverty to being a middle peasant. This is the first time in his life. His enthusiasm for production is particularly high this year, and he works in the fields all day, not returning until dark.\n\n　　When I met him again, he opened his toothless mouth and said bluntly, \"We have good houses to live in now! Come and sit at home!\" Yes, the two small houses he used to live in were dark and gloomy, like a prison. As soon as you entered the door, you felt like you were entering a prison. Now let him sing for his new times! \"I've lived for more than forty years, and I haven't lived through this year's time yet. I have an estate, I have land, and I've harvested the May crop, and I've eaten new wheat white flour!\" He warmly shook my hand, talking and laughing, laughing so hard that he couldn't close his toothless mouth.\n\n　　\"The production in this street is very vigorous this year!\" He went on to say: \"The men have joined the mutual aid groups, and the enthusiasm for production organized together is particularly great. One person can hoe more than one mu a day. We have hoeed our own land, and we have also mobilized the mutual aid group to sell labor to hoe the land of poor, widowed families and families of soldiers. We know the suffering of the poor, and we also know the difficulty of not having manpower, so we don't teach people to run around looking for people to make trouble. There is not a single person who doesn't move in this street this year, and there is not a single mu of wasteland.\" He is so diligent, busy all day long and unwilling to be idle; he is so sincere to others, knowing his own difficulties, and also being able to empathize with the difficulties of others. He always remembers that he is the leader of the masses and wants to work for the masses!\n\n　　The scorching sun is overhead. I walked north along the edge of the garden in front of the village, following the murmuring stream, winding and winding, and happened to walk to the land of the emancipated peasant Wang Heiyi. Old Wang was watering the land with a seventeen or eighteen-year-old youth in this garden that grows onions, garlic, chives... I saw his shiny back, his bronze-like arms, forgetting the heat and fatigue, and couldn't help saying, \"Old Wang, you are going to be a labor hero!\"\n\n　　\"Since I turned over in the spring, I have been busy in the field,\" he said happily. \"This is the land of Wang Gaoqiu that I bought for five thousand yuan. In those days when it was dry, I was afraid that the garlic seedlings would die of drought, so I watered the land all night long. Look at this red-skinned garlic that grows like an apple!\" He pulled one out and showed it to me. Turning his face, he put his hand with five fingers together on his waist, making gestures and said: \"The wheat in May grew to waist-deep, and I was looking forward to eating good wheat after fertilizing, but it rained for several days in a row, and it was all jaundiced, and I harvested more than half less. But even so, I harvested more than five stones this year, including dry land and paddy field, and two people can't finish eating it.\" Since Old Wang turned over, he no longer has to worry about eating one meal and not having the next.\n\n　　The people who turned over in Qingyan Temple all participated in production, and many people are organized in mutual aid groups. The men's hoes make a loud noise in the fields, and the women's spinning wheels hum at home. It is truly \"men plowing and women weaving,\" a scene of production!\n\n　　They turned over and became wealthy, and lived a good life. They have not forgotten who gave them this time.

We fought arduously in the border areas of Dangshan, Xiaxian, Yutai, Yongcheng, and the border between Jiangsu and Henan, directly and forcefully destroying the lifeblood of the Japanese invaders' blood transfusion on the Longhai Railway, repeatedly achieving victories. After multiple encirclements and suppressions by the Japanese invaders, millions of our comrades sacrificed themselves, and we barely survived, but we always persisted on the front line behind enemy lines. Last year, after the Japanese invaders surrendered and the three major agreements were successively announced, we were delighted that peace had been achieved and demobilization was expected. After nine years of hard fighting, we did not seek personal merit, but only sought to be worthy of the nation and the people. Unexpectedly, the authorities could not understand this sincerity and repeatedly issued anti-communist orders. After the victory of our resistance against Japan, we could not bear to see the civil war restart and were unwilling to be tools of the reactionary anti-communist civil war. The authorities, therefore, charged us with unfounded crimes such as ineffective anti-communism and being in communication with the communists. In June of this year, we were heavily shackled and thrown into wrongful imprisonment. Every time we think of this, it makes us furious! The purpose is actually a conspiracy to swallow up dissidents. Now, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and peace talks have all stalled. The warmongering and reactionary elements of the Kuomintang are stubbornly pursuing a one-party dictatorship, turning democratic politics into empty talk, disregarding the lives of the country and the people, seeking glory through betrayal, selling the inland river navigation rights, and handing over the Jianghai Customs Tax Department to foreigners, burying national industry and commerce, in exchange for military and material assistance from American imperialist elements, and launching a nationwide civil war. We shudder when we hear of it! Our intention in building an army to resist Japan was to seek the independence of the nation and the people and to protect the happiness of the people in our hometown. Now that the Kuomintang is determined to betray the country through civil war, we are determined to oppose the civil war and save the country, leading all 5,000 soldiers. We earnestly hope that all brotherly troops across the country will shatter the civil war conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries, unite, not be cannon fodder for the Kuomintang's few warmongering elements, jointly respond to and support the CCP Central Committee's July 7th declaration calling for opposition to the civil war. We are willing, from now on, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the CCP Central Committee and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, to fight against the civil war, strive for the survival of the Chinese nation, and build a new China that is independent, free, democratic, and happy!\n\n    Commander of the 18th Column of the Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui Border Region, Jiang Jiabin, Deputy Commander Liu Genglai, Gao Yixia, and all officers and soldiers kowtow.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋嘉宾将军率五千起义官兵  通电全国反对内战  接受中共领导为独立和平民主奋斗\n\n1946-08-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋嘉宾将军率五千起义官兵\n　　通电全国反对内战\n　　接受中共领导为独立和平民主奋斗\n    【本报荷泽十九日电】苏鲁豫皖边第十八纵队反内战通电，原文如下：\n    国民政府蒋主席、中共中央毛主席、朱德司令、民主同盟张主席、河南省刘主席，并转全国各党派、各法团、各报馆钧鉴：\n    溯自抗日战争爆发，宾等以庸碌之才，受地方父老之推重，本国民爱国家民族之热情，领导地方父老组织武装，保卫桑梓，艰苦奋斗于砀、夏、虞、永、苏豫边境，直接予陇海铁路日寇输血命脉以有力破击，屡创战功，经日寇多次扫荡合围，牺牲万千袍泽，虎口余生，但始终坚持敌后最前线。去岁日寇投降，三大协定相继公布后，方庆和平实现，复员可期；九载苦战，不图个人有功，但求无愧于国家民族。不意当局对此衷心不能谅解，反而屡下反共命令，宾等抗战胜利后，不忍再见内战重起，不愿作反动派反共内战之工具，当局乃以反共不力，及通共等莫须有之罪名，于本年六月重镣加身，陷入冤狱，每念及此，令人发指！究其目的，实为吞并异己之阴谋诡计。今者，政协决议及和平谈判皆已停顿，国民党好战反动分子一意孤行，坚持一党专政，致民主政治于空谈，置国家民命于不顾，卖国求荣，出卖内河航行权，及将江海关税务司交给外人，葬送民族工商业，以换取美帝国主义分子之军事及物资之援助，发动全国性之内战，宾等闻之不寒而栗！我等抗日建军之意旨，在求国家民族之独立及护卫桑梓人民之幸福，今国民党反动决心内战以卖国，宾等率全体五千将士，亦决心反对内战而救国，并殷望全国各兄弟部队，粉碎国民党反动派的内战阴谋，团结起来，不为国民党少数好战分子当炮灰，共同响应并拥护中共中央七七宣言反内战之号召，宾等愿今后在中共中央毛主席、朱总司令领导下，为反对内战，争取中华民族之生存，建设独立自由民主幸福之新中国而奋斗！\n    苏鲁豫皖边区十八纵队司令蒋嘉宾  副司令刘耕来  高一侠率全体官兵叩未删。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shanxi, 21st—Datong City is an important military base for Yan Xishan and the remnants of Japanese invading forces to jointly attack the liberated areas of Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Sui. After Yan's troops under Chu Xichun and the traitor Wang Zhenfan entered Datong in August of last year, all Japanese troops were retained and promoted by three ranks based on their original officer ranks, receiving salaries equivalent to second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, and major. Recently, the \"Artillery Officer Training\" and \"Infantry Officer Training\" classes run by Yan's army in Datong are staffed by these Japanese personnel as instructors. According to incomplete statistics, there are as many as 27 reorganized puppet troops and puppet police forces from various places in Northern Yanmen, including those led by An Qin, Fang Xinqian, and Li Mengshu. These were combined to form the Fifth Army of the Shanxi Provincial Defense Army (Commander and concurrently Datong Garrison Commander, Han Buzhou, with the 13th, 14th, and 15th Divisions under his command). Later, to conceal their actions from the world, the army was reorganized into the Provisional 38th Division, under the command of Zhao Chengshou's 31st Army. The Yan's puppet troops in the area once invaded and occupied over a hundred important towns in the liberated areas, including Fengzhen, Zuoyun, Gushan, Yungang, and Emao. The 15th Division of the Fifth Army of the Provincial Defense Army (reorganized from puppet troops who were formerly puppet police chiefs) committed bloody incidents such as the massacre in Zuoyun on January 15, the Huayuantun incident in Datong on February 25, and the attack on Xiaoxiji in western Datong on June 8, successively slaughtering over a hundred local masses and cadres. On July 24th, more than 2,000 Yan's puppet infantry and cavalry from Datong attacked Sanlipu in the direction of Yanggao. Special agent organizations are everywhere in the city. According to investigations, these include the Resources Investigation Society, Yanbei Office, Datong \"Leading Group,\" \"Investigation and Statistics Office,\" the Second Working Group of the Second War Zone Headquarters, the Comrades Association, the Jinbei Party Affairs Office of the Kuomintang, the Jinbei Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the \"Assassination Squad.\" The Resources Investigation Society was originally a Japanese intelligence agency, later taken over by Yan Xishan with the original staff, led by Japanese intelligence chief Major General Nakahara. The head of the \"Assassination Squad\" is a Japanese named Kouki Fukui. The squad was established in May of this year and has thirteen \"Assassination Groups,\" each ranging from six to thirty people, carrying out sabotage activities such as assassinations and robberies in the liberated areas of the Northern Section of the Tongpu Railway.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th—Beijing News: The 14th Division of the 16th Army stationed in Changxindian and the 22nd Division stationed in Nankou of Chiang's army were transferred without authorization in early June, and part of them participated in the attack on Panggezhuang and Anci areas north of the Yongding River in the Hebei-Central Hebei Liberated Area. At the joint staff meeting of the Executive Headquarters on the 8th, all three parties unanimously agreed that this violated Order No. 4 and that all persons in charge of the two divisions should be formally reprimanded.\n\nThis newspaper, Yangcheng, 20th—At 11:00 on the 19th, Chiang's troops entrenched in Wenxi, Southern Shanxi, attacked from Dongzhen in three routes, capturing Houma, the commercial center of Southern Shanxi and the intersection of the Tongpu Railway and the Qu(wo)-Xin(jiang) Highway. Two regiments of Yan's 72nd Division stationed in Xinjiang also launched attacks on the same day in coordination.

According to refugees who fled from Shan County: Shan County purchased military grain twice from the end of November last year to the end of April this year. In the first phase, the price of wheat was set at 45 yuan per jin, and in the second phase, it was issued at 26 yuan, 1 jiao, 8 fen, and 5 li. If calculated at the market price at the time, the people had to compensate more than 100 yuan per jin of wheat on average. Based on the county's population, each person had to bear a compensation fee of about 30,000 yuan for just one purchase of military grain. At the same time, the actual wheat price issued was mostly embezzled by Kuomintang bureaucrats and baojia heads, and the people's losses amounted to more than 2 billion yuan. From November last year to the end of May this year, Xiuwu built 576 bunkers, costing a total of 2.23714 billion yuan, plus the funds allocated by the security teams of various counties, totaling 267.73 million yuan. Based on the 50,000 people in the stubborn occupied area of Xiuwu, each person had to bear 50,000 yuan.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 13th dispatch] Landlords who were temporarily misled by Kuomintang secret agents' rumors and fled to Jinan, Cang County, Yanzhou, Xuzhou, Haizhou and other places, nearly 700 people have recently returned to their hometowns with their families. Liu Hengren, a landlord who returned to Linyi, cried to his fellow villagers, saying: \"Before, I was blinded by greed and lightly believed the reactionary rumors and fled to Jinan. All the cash I carried was robbed by the merciless Central Army on the way. When I arrived in Yanzhou, I was falsely accused of being a 'traitor' and subjected to chili water torture and imprisoned for more than 20 days. I can't finish telling the suffering I have endured in two days.\" Ye Zhenshu, a landlord who fled from Cang County, and his family said: \"We were extorted so badly by the running dogs. In Cangzhou, we had nothing to eat or drink and had to keep making donations. The carts and donkeys we brought were all forced to be sold.\" Liu Xianzhu, a landlord who had participated in the assassination squad in Cang County, decided to repent and start anew after returning home, and handed over his pistol to the democratic government. At present, the democratic governments in various places have returned the land held in trust to the landlords and are coordinating to help those who are temporarily in financial difficulties settle down.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不堪蒋军内战勒索  人民纷纷逃来解放区  山东被骗地主七百余人携眷返乡\n\n1946-08-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　不堪蒋军内战勒索\n　　人民纷纷逃来解放区\n　　山东被骗地主七百余人携眷返乡\n    【阳城二十一日电】蒋军发动大规模内战，军粮催似火急，人民倾家破产，大批向解放区逃亡。据陕县逃来之难民谈：陕县从去年十一月底到今年四月底止，前后代购军粮两次，第一期每斤麦子规定价格四十五元，第二期按二十六元一角八分五发给，如以当时市价计算，平均每斤麦子人民得赔偿百元以上，按全县人口分摊，仅代购军粮一次，每人即须负担赔偿费三万元左右。同时实际所发麦价，又多为国民党官僚保甲长贪污中饱，人民的损失，达二十亿元以上。修武自去年十一月到今年五月底止，构筑碉堡五百七十六座，共花洋二十二亿三千七百一十四万元，加上各县保安团队派款共为二十六万万七千七百三十万元。按修武顽占区五万人计算，每人负担即达五万元。\n    【新华社临沂十三日电】一时误信国民党特务造谣而逃往济南、沧县、兖州、徐州、海州等地之地主，近已有七百余人陆续携眷返乡。回至临沂的地主刘恒人向其乡亲哭诉称：“以前我是油蒙住心，轻信反动派谣言逃往济南，所携现款均在中途遭狼心狗肺的中央军劫去。在到兖州时，且被诬为‘奸民’灌辣椒水，囚禁二十余日。回想所受的罪两天也说不完。”由沧县逃来之地主叶贞书及其眷属说：“可叫狗腿子敲诈苦了，在沧州无吃无喝还要不断拿捐，带去的大车和驴骡都被迫卖光了。”曾参加沧县暗杀团之地主刘宪洲，返家后决心悔过自新，并把驳壳枪送交民主政府。现各地民主政府均分别将代管土地交还地主，并协同帮助暂时生活困难者安家。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 21st. After receiving the Central Committee's instructions on rectifying discipline, Military Region Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping personally took charge of rectifying the discipline of the directly subordinate units. They proposed a specific key point for discipline rectification: Comrades leading troops should first look at the quality of discipline rectification in their directly subordinate units, and even their directly subordinate personnel and their guards. One day, a directly subordinate unit requested 25 carts from the government for official business. After inspection by Liu, Deng, and Chief of Staff Li, it was determined that only 17 carts were needed, so they urged the return of the excess and criticized the unnecessary request. Commander Liu summoned the personnel of the unit to speak, pointing out that this matter concerned the relationship between the military and the people and the issue of troop discipline. If this was damaged, the serious task of patriotic self-defense could not be completed. He said: \"Chairman Mao calls our army the people's army, and serving the people is our characteristic. However, since the counter-offensive, a small number of personnel have engaged in acts that violate mass discipline. If we are not conscious of this and cannot follow Chairman Mao's words, even though the masses support and sympathize with us, if we go too far, we will inevitably become detached from the masses.\" Commander Liu also pointed out that to implement the Party's instructions, Party members and cadres must play a role. He said: \"Cadres are the backbone, and they must be combined with the masses, otherwise they are just skeletons. Are we willing to be the backbone, or be skeletons?\" He also said: \"The army is the people in military uniform, and should never forget its roots.\" He very solemnly said to everyone: \"Before this severe national crisis, we should resolutely implement self-defense and even more diligently execute Chairman Mao's instructions.\" Finally, he called on everyone not to adopt a liberal attitude towards those who violate discipline, but to rise up and maintain discipline, and ideologically persuade those who violate discipline. Those who violate discipline are only 3 or 4 percent, and if the majority rise up to maintain discipline, the evil wind will not be able to raise its head. Political Commissar Deng then pointed out that this was a fundamental issue, and not just a trivial matter. To repel the attacks of the Kuomintang reactionaries aided by American imperialist elements, as long as we are unwilling to see national independence, democracy, and peace undermined, we should take responsibility to maintain discipline and protect the interests of the masses. He painfully pointed out: \"Some personnel cannot carry their backpacks when walking, and even two small packages must be carried by the common people, as if we came for the revolution and the common people should crawl at our feet. Today, the relationship between the common people and us is good, but if we do this because it's good, how can we live with ourselves!?\" He asked everyone to unite and implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and that everyone should take responsibility, believing that it can be done well.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刘司令员、邓政委  亲自整顿直属队纪律  指出要完成爱国自卫战争的任务必须维护部队纪律爱护群众利益\n\n1946-08-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刘司令员、邓政委\n　　亲自整顿直属队纪律\n　　指出要完成爱国自卫战争的任务必须维护部队纪律爱护群众利益\n    【新华社邯郸二十一日电】军区刘伯承司令员、邓小平政委于接到中央整纪指示后，亲自负责整顿直属队纪律，他们对整纪提出一个具体要点：带部队的同志对部队纪律整顿得好坏，首先要看他的直属队甚至要看他的直属人员和他的警卫员。有一天直属队因公向政府要了二十五辆大车，经刘、邓和李参谋长检查后，只要十七辆就够了，便督促退还，批评不该多要。刘司令员当召集该部人员讲话，指出这件事有关军民关系与部队纪律问题，如果破坏了这个东西，爱国自卫的严重任务就不能完成。他说：“毛主席把我们的军队叫做人民的军队，为人民服务是特色。但自反攻以来，少数人员有破坏群众纪律现象，如果我们还不自觉，不能照毛主席的话去做，虽然群众是拥护和同情我们的，但如果我们太过分了，必然要脱离了群众。刘司令员并指出实现党的指示，党员干部一定要起作用。他说：“干部是骨干，一定要与群众结合，不然就是骷髅，我们究竟愿意当骨干，还是当骷髅”。又说：“军队是穿军装的人民，绝不该忘本”，他非常沉重的对大家说：“我们在这严重的民族危机之前，应当坚决实行自卫，更应该竞竞业业的执行毛主席的指示”。最后并号召大家对破坏纪律的分子，不要采取自由主义，都起来维护纪律，从思想上说服破坏纪律的人，破坏纪律的也不过百分之三或四，多数起来维护纪律，歪风就不能抬头。邓政委接着也指出这是一个根本问题，绝不是一个枝节问题，我们要打退美帝国主义分子帮助下的国民党反动派的进攻，只要不甘心国家独立、民主、和平受到破坏，就应该负起责任好好维持纪律，爱护群众利益。他沉痛的指出：“有些人员走路不能背背包，两个小包袱也要找老百姓挑，好像我们是为革命而来，老百姓应该在脚下爬。今天老百姓对我们的关系是好的，好我们就这样作，心怎么过得下去！？”他要求大家团结、执行三大纪律八项注意，大家都负起责任来，相信会做好的。"

Before the徴收, the people were already in a state of panic, as if a catastrophe was imminent.

The Sichuan native student associations of four schools, National Jiaotong University, Shanghai Law College, Shanghai Taxation College, and National Tongji University, sent a telegram to the whole country at the beginning of this month, opposing continued徴收 in kind, stating: The rural economy of Sichuan Province is on the verge of bankruptcy. This year, there was a spring drought, followed by floods. Warehouses are empty and resources are exhausted, and disaster victims are everywhere, displaced and begging in all directions. Try closing your eyes and thinking about it, isn't the situation tragic!? If the government continues徴收 in kind, it will plunge our Shu people into a deep abyss! Ninety-four students from Sichuan Province at the National Southwestern Associated University also jointly sent a telegram, recounting that during the War of Resistance, Sichuan Province provided 16 million conscripts and 60 million shi of grain. After the end of the War of Resistance, the government ordered a one-year exemption from agricultural tax, but who knew that the order would be changed in the morning and the promise broken in the evening, deceiving the people. This is intolerable! The Henan Disaster Appeal Group, after arriving in Beijing last month, petitioned the Ministry of Food on the 16th. Xu Kan was out, and Vice Minister Pang Songzhou received them. The representatives recounted the suffering of the Henan people, with tears in their eyes. After Xu returned, he excused himself as \"tired\" and refused to meet them. The representatives were very angry and said that Xu must come out. They would not leave without meeting him. Xu was forced to come out, but he did not listen to the representatives' statements and said, \"I am clear about the situation in Henan. I will tell Chairman Chiang and Dean Song when I get back,\" and then left the meeting. The representatives were forced to withdraw, grumbling repeatedly. In addition, the Guangdong Province's agricultural purchase徴收 in kind this year has a purchase quota of six dou and five sheng per liang. The province徴收 a total of 4.5 million shi and sought back old debts from the 34th year of the Republic to supply military grain. However, according to the exaggerated estimates of the Field Grain Office, this year's upper season harvest in Guangdong Province was only 50%, producing about 38.41 million shi of grain. The half-year food shortage for the people is still 20.19 million shi, and the food problem is extremely serious. People from all walks of life in Guangdong Province are calling out and opposing grain徴收 and徴收 in kind.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 加紧扩大内战  蒋政府提前征军粮  各地人民叫苦到处反对\n\n1946-08-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　加紧扩大内战\n　　蒋政府提前征军粮\n　　各地人民叫苦到处反对\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】沪讯：国民党政府原规定于九月起开始田赋征实及征借，现已内战军粮需要甚急，各省已纷纷提前开征，人民对此叫苦连声。浙江省府于上月命令：“在有早种收获的各县市提前于七月中开征”。浙省原为缺米省份，今年须出粮米约六百万石，二千万人连小娃娃老头子，平均每人要出“田赋”两斛，而地方摊派勒索还不在内。最近民间流行一句话：“抗来了白色恐怖！”陕西田赋二百多万石，亦提前于本月中旬开征，在开征前，人民即惶惶然，若大难临头。遭逢空前旱灾的湖南，今年田赋额达四百万石，征借一百二十万石，带征公粮一百万石，共六百二十万石，亦提出于本月中旬开征。\n    【新华社延安二十一日电】据沪报载：各地人民继续反对勒索军粮及田赋征实，国立交大、上海法学院、上海税专、国立同济大学四校川籍同学会，于本月初通电全国，反对继续征实，略谓：川省农村经济已濒破产，今年春旱见于前，水灾继于后，仓空匮乏，灾黎遍野，流离辗转，行乞四方，试闭目以思，状宁不惨！？政府若复继续征实，是重陷吾蜀人民于水深火热之中矣！国立西南联大川籍学生九十四人，亦联名通电，历述抗战中川省出丁千六百万，出粮六千万石，抗战结束后，政府令免田赋一年，孰知竟朝令夕改，食言欺民，是可忍孰不可忍？！豫灾哭诉团于上月抵京后，于十六日至粮食部请愿，适徐堪外出由次长庞松舟接见，各代表历陈豫民痛苦，声泪俱下。徐归来后，又借口“疲乏”不见，各代表大愤，咸谓一定要徐出来，不见面不走，徐被迫出见后，竟不听各代表陈诉完毕，即谓“河南情形我清楚，回头告诉蒋主席宋院长”，即行离席。各代表被迫退出，忿忿连声。又粤省今年田购征实，购额每两征六斗五升，全省共征四百五十万石，并追索三十四年旧欠供应军粮，但即据田粮处的夸大估计，今年上季广东全省收成亦仅有五成，约产谷三千八百四十一万石，半年民食尚缺二千零十九万石，粮食问题极为严重。粤省各界人民正纷纷呼吁，并反对征粮征实。"

Representatives from Albania, Mexico, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, and Austria all spoke at the plenary session. Albanian Prime Minister General Hoxha delivered the first speech, requesting compensation from Italy to Albania and fair treatment. He said: Albania was the first victim of Italian aggression, but Albania fought the overwhelmingly superior aggressor single-handedly and never ceased to resist. The Albanian People's Liberation Army tied down 170,000 German and Italian troops. The Albanian troops forcibly conscripted by Italy to fight against Greece also staged a mutiny and sided with the Allied forces. He vehemently denied Greece's statement that Albania attacked Greece. He said that there was a world of difference between the Albanian people and Albanian Quislings. Hoxha expressed dissatisfaction with Albania being listed as having the same qualifications as Austria, and demanded that his country attend the conference on an equal footing with the other twenty-one participating countries and have the right to sign the peace treaty with Italy. Hoxha also proposed further reducing the Italian army, navy, and air force, and that the total amount of compensation from Italy to the Balkan countries should be 300 million gold francs (approximately 87.5 million US dollars). The Mexican representative requested compensation from Italy, the Cuban representative requested Cuba to be a participating country, the Egyptian representative requested that Italy's destruction on Egyptian territory should be compensated by Italian property in Egypt, the Austrian representative requested that South Tyrol be划归 Austria, and the Iranian representative had not yet arrived in Paris, so the Iranian ambassador to France made a brief speech.

An unprecedented large-scale civil war has spread and is burning across the country.\n\n　　Fellow elders and brothers of the entire border region! Administrative comrades of the entire border region! Let us all mobilize urgently and do the following tasks well to fully support the frontlines and fight for the victory of the frontlines.\n\n　　(1) Organize war service work with the greatest strength, organize transport teams, stretcher teams, and rescue teams; ensure the supply of food to the troops; transport and supply weapons and ammunition; rescue and treat the wounded and sick, and clean up the battlefield after the battle. Women should take care of the wounded and sick as if they were their own family members, and make military shoes strong and durable so that the army does not have shoe problems. Administrative comrades must ensure the mobilization and supply of manpower and materials for the war. Organize well and minimize waste. Militiamen, self-defense team members, and all the people should actively participate in the war. Ensure that the frontlines do not feel any difficulties, so that our army can fight with peace of mind and win battles frequently.\n\n　　(2) District and village cadres must stick to their posts in wartime and help the troops solve all difficulties. All the people should support their own army and help the troops solve living difficulties such as oil, vegetables, and firewood. Ensure that the troops can eat during combat. Economic departments, public and private businesses at all levels should pay attention to stabilizing prices, strictly prohibiting unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating; stabilize finance and stabilize the wartime economy. Governments at all levels should do a good job in preferential treatment and support for the families of soldiers and martyrs. Launch labor support movements, mobilize the people to support the army, and work together for the victory of the war.\n\n　　(3) Cultural and educational departments should strengthen propaganda work, encourage the masses' enthusiasm for participating in the war, disseminate victory news in a timely manner, and enhance fighting courage. In areas affected by the war, students should organize to participate in propaganda, comfort, and rescue work, and earnestly serve for the victory of the war.\n\n　　(4) Under any circumstances, the mass emancipation movement must be implemented, and it must not be relaxed in the slightest due to the urgency of the war. This is an important guarantee for winning the war. Strive to practice production and thrift, pay attention to cherishing the people's strength, and develop various agricultural, industrial, and sideline productions. Oppose corruption and waste, practice frugality, and use all strength to support the frontlines. Promote the model of combining war and production, and mobilize women and semi-labor forces to participate in production to support the long-term struggle.\n\n　　(5) Strengthen rear area security work. Militias, self-defense teams, and local governments should be responsible for maintaining local order, strengthening sentry checks, preventing the infiltration of special agents and spies, and maintaining the tranquility of the rear area.\n\n　　(6) This war is of great importance to the safety of our entire liberated area, the well-being of the people of the whole country, and the future of the country and the nation; we must defeat the reactionaries' offensive. Our goal in combat is to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, so sometimes we do not focus on the gains and losses of one city or one place. Some areas may be temporarily occupied by the reactionary army, and we must be fully prepared ideologically. In any place that is temporarily occupied, the remaining cadres should combine with local armed forces, militias, and the entire population to launch widespread guerrilla warfare. Disrupt the reactionary army's transportation, kill and wound the enemy, and finally cooperate with the main force to annihilate the enemy.\n\n　　(7) Finally, we call on all regions and comrades to launch a work competition, a kill-the-enemy competition, to formulate work plans, to launch competition movements, and to create many mass work models and kill-the-enemy heroes.\n\n　　Victory will surely belong to the broad masses of the people.\n\nAugust 21st\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫边区政府  为全力支援前线争取爱国自卫战争胜利向全边区人民与行政工作人员的紧急号召\n\n1946-08-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫边区政府\n　　为全力支援前线争取爱国自卫战争胜利向全边区人民与行政工作人员的紧急号召\n    蒋介石反动大军，正着着进逼并已侵入我晋冀鲁豫边区，空前大规模内战已在全国各地蔓延燃烧着。\n    全边区的父老同胞们！全边区的行政工作同志们！大家紧急动员起来，把下列几件工作做好，以全力支援前线，一切为着前线的胜利而斗争。\n    （一）以最大的力量组织战争勤务工作，组织运输队、担架队、救护队；要保证部队的粮食供给；武器弹药的运输补给；伤病员的救护医治，战斗后的打扫战场。妇女看护伤病员，要如对自己家人一样的看护，做军鞋要牢固结实，使军队不致发生鞋子困难。行政工作同志，要保证参战人力物力的动员供给。要组织的好而又少浪费。民兵自卫队员和全体人民，都应踊跃参战。要保证前方不感到一点困难，使我们军队安心作战，经常打胜仗。\n    （二）区村干部在战争情况下，必须坚持岗位工作，帮助部队解决一切困难。全体人民要拥护自己的军队，帮助部队解决油、菜、柴火等生活上的困难。保证部队在战斗中能吃上饭。各级政府经济部门公私商号要注意平抑物价，严禁奸商囤积居奇；稳定金融，稳定战时经济。各级政府更要把优抗工作做好。发动劳军运动，发动人民拥护军队，共同为战争的胜利而努力。\n    （三）文教部门要加强宣传工作，鼓动群众的参战热忱，及时传播胜利消息，提高斗争勇气。在战事波及地区，学生应组织参加宣传、慰劳、救护等工作，切实为战争胜利而服务。\n    （四）任何情况下，要贯彻群众翻身运动，不能因战争紧迫而丝毫放松。这是争取战争胜利的重要保证。努力厉行生产节约，注意爱惜民力，发展各种农、工、副业生产。反对贪污浪费，实行节衣缩食，以一切力量来支援前线。发扬战争与生产结合的模范，发动妇女半劳动力参加生产，以支持长期斗争。\n    （五）加强后方警戒工作，民兵自卫队地方政府要负责维持地方秩序，加强岗哨盘查，防止特务奸细的混入，保持后方的安宁。\n    （六）这次战争对我全解放区安危，全国人民的祸福，国家民族前途，关系至巨；我们必须打败反动派的进攻。我们在作战上，目的是要歼灭敌人的有生力量，所以有时并不在争一城一地的得失，有些地区可能暂时被反动军侵占，我们必须作充分的思想准备。凡暂时被侵占的地方，留下的干部，应该结合地方武装、民兵和全体群众，普遍展开游击战争。破坏反动军交通，杀伤敌人，最后配合主力军歼灭敌人。\n    （七）最后，我们号召各地区、各同志展开一个工作竞赛，杀敌竞赛，订立工作计划，开展竞赛运动，创造出许多群众的工作模范与杀敌英雄。\n    胜利是一定属于广大人民的。\n                                                  八月二十一日"

Recently, our Eighth Route Army rescued over 300 wounded officers and soldiers, including battalion commanders from the 91st and 92nd Regiments, who had been abandoned by the Kuomintang on the Southern Shanxi battlefield. After careful treatment by our front-line hospitals, most have now recovered. Yang Qingyun, a first-class private in the first platoon of the fourth company of the 91st Regiment of the 31st Division of the Kuomintang (from Xucheng County, Henan, wounded in the Weiqi battle in Xia County, Southern Shanxi), was so grateful when he was discharged from the hospital that he could not speak. He voluntarily initiated writing letters to his comrades remaining in the Jiang army, telling them about his feelings after arriving in the liberated area. The letter said: \"I was wounded in the Weiqi battle in Xia County, and the Eighth Route Army carried me to the hospital, providing food, clothing, and bedding. The doctors treated me, and the nurses took care of me as if I were their own brothers in the Eighth Route Army. The Central Army says the Eighth Route Army kills people indiscriminately, but now I know that is false. There are also over 300 wounded battalion commanders and soldiers from our 91st and 92nd Regiments who are recovering well in the Eighth Route Army hospital. Our Central Army is fighting for Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, while the Eighth Route Army is working for the people. I think the brothers in our Central Army should revolt together and cooperate with the Eighth Route Army; only then will we have a way out.\"\n    [Telegram from Yangcheng, 21st] Order has been quickly restored in Hongdong County after liberation, earning unanimous praise from residents, merchants, and foreign friends in the city. After our army liberated the city, a patrol team composed of cadres was immediately formed to maintain order in the city. They can stop anyone from violating discipline. Belgian Bishop Wendel and Father Ge Mulin praised our army's bravery and strict discipline.

    "content": "The Harbin authorities have recently released details of the assassination of Northeast anti-Japanese hero General Li Zhaolin (Zhang Shoujian). Since the arrest of the perpetrators Ma Jianchen, Gao Qingsan, and others, repeated interrogations have proven that this case was entirely a planned and organized conspiracy by the Kuomintang secret service. The main culprits who directly commanded and arranged this assassination were Yu Xiuhou, the Kuomintang Harbin Police Chief, He Shiying, the chief of the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau’s Binjiang Organization Section, Yan Zhongzhang, the leader of the commando unit, and the special agent Sun Geling. Those who participated in the assassination were their secret service henchmen, the remnants of the puppet army, traitors, and bandits Ma Jianchen, Gao Qingsan, Yan Dawei, Liu Xixian, Liu Wensheng, Sun Haijing, and many others.\n\nWhen the Kuomintang \"took over\" Harbin, General Li Zhaolin, with the utmost sincerity, resigned from his position as Deputy Chairman of the Songjiang Provisional Provincial Government and served exclusively as the Chairman of the Harbin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in order to cooperate with the Kuomintang in Harbin and jointly seek peace in the Northeast. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries regarded him as their greatest enemy and were determined to kill him. He had long been listed as the number one target on the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau's \"Bin Group\" (Binjiang Organization Section) blacklist. After Yu Xiuhou took office as Police Chief, he took on the dual role of executing this conspiracy plan. Lin Zaichun, the head of the Harbin Military Statistics Bureau's secret service, introduced Yu Xiuhou as a Major General of the Military Statistics Bureau, the highest responsible person for Chiang Kai-shek's secret service in Harbin, at the swearing-in ceremony of the commando unit. Yu told his secret service henchmen in his speech, \"In the future, what the police station cannot do, you must do...\". Later, after Lin Zaichun left, Yu Xiuhou directly led and organized this assassination. Under Yu Xiuhou's orders, the special agent He Shiying established secret service organs all around the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and General Li Zhaolin's residence. They once attempted to assassinate General Li Zhaolin at a rally at the Modern Hotel, but the plot failed due to the strict Soviet military guards. Therefore, the secret service bandits set up an assassination mechanism at No. 9 Shuidao Street – the residence of commando member Sun Haijing. First, Yang Chuoan, the Kuomintang Mayor of Harbin, repeatedly invited Li Zhaolin to walk from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to the Huafenglou Restaurant, passing in front of the assassination mechanism, thereby exposing Li Zhaolin's face for the secret agents to recognize. At the same time, in order to make General Li habitually take walks, a special agent Sun Geling – an employee of Yang Chuoan's municipal government, who was introduced to Li Zhaolin by Yang – infiltrated the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, gaining the opportunity to interact with General Li Zhaolin.\n\nOn March 7th, the special agents gathered at the Balas Hotel and agreed to assassinate General Li Zhaolin at Sun Haijing's house on the 8th. That day, Sun Geling went to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to report important matters to General Li Zhaolin, and said that he wanted to arrange a secret talk with ××× at No. 9 Shuidao Street. At that time, General Zhaolin did not go due to some matters, so the special service bandits changed the assassination plan to the next day. On the 9th, the murder was arranged more meticulously. At noon, the special agents first gathered at ×××'s place, and then went to Sun's house. Sun Xixian contacted the × platoon leader of the Tieshi unit of the opposite garrison for mutual cooperation. The special agent Liu Wensheng put poison in the kettle. He Shiying directed the wiping of footprints on the floor on the spot, leaving Sun Geling in the room, while the murderers Yan Zhongzhang, Gao Qingsan, and Meng Qingyun hid in the corridor room next door. In addition, bandits such as Ma Jianchen, Liu Xixian, and Liu Wensheng were arranged to patrol outside, responsible for capturing General Li Zhaolin's guards. Just then, General Li Zhaolin came out of Comrade Zhong Ziyun's place. He had said that he was going to an appointment with an important person ×××. On the way, due to a car malfunction, he left the guards to watch the car being repaired. He took a horse-drawn carriage back to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and hurriedly told his secretary, \"I'm going to No. 9 Shuidao Street,\" and left alone. At about half-past four, General Li was first poisoned. The special agents agreed to use shouting \"Have another bowl!\" and knocking on the table as a signal. Yan Zhongzhang led bandits Meng Qingyun and Gao Qingsan out of the corridor room, first searched General Zhaolin for his pistol, and then took a sharp knife and stabbed him seven times (eight holes). This national hero, who persisted in the Northeast Anti-Japanese War for fourteen years and did not die in the enemy's hail of bullets, was deprived of his life in the vile assassination by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents.\n\nAfter the thugs committed the crime, they planned to chop up the body, put it in sacks, transport it away, and throw it into the river to eliminate traces. The Soviet military originally notified Yu Xiuhou to send a detective team to No. 9 Shuidao Street to search at 9:00 a.m. the next day, entirely to cover up the plan to move the body, but delayed the notification to the detective team until 2:00 p.m. the next day. The next morning, the special agent Liu Xixian openly wore a police uniform, carrying two pistols, and took a horse-drawn carriage to Shuidao Street to move the body. On the way, the Soviet military on alert searched out the guns, and the bandit Liu was sent to Yu Xiuhou's place, but Yu Xiuhou released him. At the same time, during this period, Yu Xiuhou maintained close contact with the murderous special agents, so most of the special agent bandits escaped. Despite their actions being so secretive, their criminal behavior could not be hidden. When Sun Haijing's house was initially searched, He Shiying's diary was discovered, which provided important clues about the situation of the secret service organ and the main persons responsible for the assassination. In addition, the special agents had promised to use 100,000 yuan to buy off Gao Qingsan, but only gave 4,000 yuan, so secrets were constantly leaked. Under the observation of the public, the Democratic Allied Forces finally captured the criminals not long after entering Harbin. Ma Jianchen, Gao Qingsan, and others confessed all the details of the case. Now that the criminals have been captured and the truth has been revealed, the Northeast public opinion is continuing to accuse the Kuomintang secret service organs of their heinous crimes to the people of the country and the world, and demands that the Kuomintang authorities repay this blood debt!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李兆麟将军被害经过\n\n1946-08-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李兆麟将军被害经过\n    哈尔滨当局顷发表东北抗日英雄李兆麟（张寿篯）将军被暗杀案的详情。自凶犯马建臣、高庆三等就捕后，经多次侦讯，已证明此案是完全出于国民党特务机关有计划有组织的阴谋，直接指挥和布置这一暗杀的主凶，乃是国民党哈尔滨警察局长余秀豪，以及国民党军统局滨江组织科科长何士英、别动队长阎钟璋、特务孙格玲等，参加暗杀的则有他们的特务爪牙伪军余孽汉奸土匪马建臣、高庆三、阎大维、刘希贤、刘文升、孙海镜等多人。\n    当国民党“接收”哈市时，李兆麟将军不惜以最大诚意辞去松江临时省政府副主席职务，专任哈市中苏友好协会会长，以便在哈与国民党合作，共谋东北的和平。然而国民党反动派却把他看作最大仇人，一定要杀之而后快。在国民党军统局“滨组”（滨江组织科）的黑名单上早就将他列为第一名。当余秀豪出任警察局长后，他更一身而二任的执行这个阴谋计划。哈市军统局特务头子林再春，曾在别动队的宣誓典礼上介绍余秀豪是军统局的少将，哈尔滨的蒋介石特务最高负责人。而余氏则在训话中告诉特务爪牙说：“今后警察局不能作的事，要靠你们来作………”。以后林再春离去，余秀豪便直接领导组织这一暗杀。由于余秀豪的授命，特务何士英在中苏友好协会及李兆麟将军的住宅附近遍设特务机关，他们曾企图在马迭尔饭店的一次集会上刺杀李兆麟将军，当时由于苏军警戒森严，阴谋未逞。于是特务匪徒便在水道街九号——别动队员孙海镜的住所布置好暗杀机关。先是国民党哈尔滨市长杨绰庵几次邀李兆麟徒步由中苏友好协会走到华丰楼饭馆去吃饭，道经暗杀机关门前，借此暴露李兆麟面目，给特务认识。同时为了麻痹李将军常作徒步行动，并用一个由他介绍李兆麟相识的特务孙格玲——杨绰庵市府的职员，混进中苏友好协会，取得与李兆麟将军来往的机会。\n    三月七日，特务们就在巴拉斯旅馆集合，约定八日在孙海镜家谋杀李兆麟将军。那天孙格玲曾往中苏友好协会向李兆麟将军报告重要事项，并谓要和×××约李去水道街九号密谈，当时兆麟将军因事未去，特务匪徒乃将暗杀计划改为翌日。九日的谋杀布置得更加周密，正午时特务们先在×××处集合，然后到了孙家，由孙希贤和对面驻军铁石部队×连长取的联络，互相策应。特务刘文升在水壶中放下了毒药，当场由何士英指挥擦去地板上的脚印，将孙格玲留在房内，杀人犯阎钟璋、高庆三、孟庆云则隐藏在邻室的廊房里。另外布置马建臣、刘希贤、刘文升等匪徒在外巡风，担任捉拿李兆麟将军的警卫员。这正是李兆麟将军由钟子云同志处出来，他曾说：自己赴要员×××处约会。途中由于汽车损坏，留下警卫员看着修理车子，他坐了马车回到中苏友好协会后，匆匆的仅交待他的秘书一句：“我到水道街九号。”就只身而去，约在四时半左右，李将军先被毒药毒倒，特务约定以喊“再喝一碗吧”，和敲桌为记，阎钟璋率领孟庆云、高庆三等匪徒由廊房出来，先搜了兆麟将军的手枪，拿起利刀在他身上连刺七刀（八孔），这位坚持十四年东北抗战没有死在敌人枪林弹雨中的一代民族英雄，就在蒋介石特务卑劣的暗杀中被夺去了生命。\n    暴徒行凶以后，计划将尸体砍断以麻袋装上运走掷于江中，以消灭痕迹。苏军本通知余秀豪于次日晨九时派侦缉队到水道街九号搜查，全为掩饰移尸计划，竟拖延至次日下午二时始通知侦缉队。第二天的早晨，特务刘希贤公然穿着警察制服，带两支手枪，坐着马车到水道街去移尸，途中被警戒的苏军搜出枪支，刘匪被送到余秀豪处，而余秀豪竟将他放走。同时在此期间，余秀豪和行凶的特务一直保持着密切的联系，因此特务匪徒遂大部漏网。尽管他们的行动如此诡密，他们的罪恶行为依然掩藏不住。当最初搜查孙海镜家时就发现何士英遗留的日记，关于特务机关的情况以及参加暗杀的主要负责人等都提供了重要的线索。此外特务们曾经答应用十万元收买高庆三，结果却只给了四千元，于是秘密便不断泄露。在众目昭彰之下，民主联军终于在进驻哈市后不久，就先将凶犯捕获了。马建臣、高庆三等均供出全部案情。现在凶犯就擒，真相大白，东北舆论界正在继续向全国及全世界人士控诉国民党特务机关的滔天罪行，并要求国民党当局偿还这一笔血债！"

It is reported that when the Yan puppet troops along the Bai Jin Road fled north at the end of last month, they completely removed the railway tracks south of Zihongkou, strengthened the fortifications of Pan Tuo, and attempted to hold Zihongkou. However, under the siege and harassment of our local armed forces and militia, they finally retreated in defeat on the 8th.\n    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] Yan Xishan, in violation of the truce agreement, colluded with Japanese puppets to launch a frantic offensive against our liberated areas along the Bai Jin Line.

She worked very energetically. The women of Nanyangquan automatically went to Shenling to comfort the soldiers, carrying 25 kilograms of pears and 68 kilograms of pancakes. They said to the soldiers, \"We are sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the intention is heavy. This is a token of our women's hearts, please accept it, comrades!\" The women of Nanfenggou worked for several nights without sleep.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[This Newspaper, Handan, 20th] Comrade Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Region, recently convened a meeting with comrades from direct subordinate units departing for frontline inspection work, and gave a speech on the central task of current political work. He began by stating: Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, with the assistance of American imperialist elements, has launched a reactionary large-scale offensive that undermines peace and democracy and betrays the nation-state. Following the siege of our Central Plains Fifth Division, they have proceeded to attack our eastern Henan, Shandong, central Jiangsu, northern Huai, and southern Shanxi regions. Recently, they have further provoked conflicts in Jehol and eastern Henan. Their planes are also bombing everywhere, having bombed Huaiyin, Jining, and other places, and most recently, Yan'an. In the rear areas, they are suppressing democracy everywhere, and have recently even brutally murdered democratic figures. Chiang Kai-shek is now forcing the entire people to their death. Our task today is to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's attacking troops and shatter Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive. Only by shattering Chiang Kai-shek's offensive can we restore peace, realize democracy, and guarantee national independence. He then pointed out that the first central task of today's political work is to make every officer and soldier aware of the current situation and the sacred task of the patriotic self-defense war, to raise everyone's level of awareness, political sense of responsibility, and combat courage, and to believe that our operations are just and reasonable actions. We have the firm support of the people and democratic figures across the country, and our self-defense operations represent the demands of the people across the country, related to peace and democracy, and related to the survival and independence of the nation. Everyone must conscientiously carry out this task of the patriotic self-defense war, so that all officers and soldiers strengthen unity, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory in the war. Second, ensure the enforcement of military discipline in the troops. We must be more organized and disciplined, united as one, acting and marching in unison, obeying orders and commands. Only in this way can we be stronger and more easily shatter Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Third, ensure the implementation of the policy of winning over the masses and political discipline. The combat is for the people's peace, democracy, and national liberation. Without the people, there can be no victory. When all personnel come into contact with the masses, they must publicize to the masses, explaining Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, his destruction of peace and democracy, his brutal killing of the people and democratic figures, and the crimes of American imperialist elements assisting Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war. Explain why we must defend ourselves and shatter Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. But we must also first ensure that all personnel cherish the interests of the masses in action and strictly enforce the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. For the few who violate discipline, after education, we must mobilize everyone to supervise their actions, and at the same time, we must punish those who violate discipline. This is very important and must be constantly educated and inspected to truly achieve not taking even a needle or thread from the people. Fourth, ensure the enforcement of economic discipline. In our self-defense war, we must recover some cities and villages and seize many supplies. These must be guaranteed to belong to the public. As for the difficulties that many troops have to solve in combat, and the rewards for the merits of some troops in combat, these should be done entirely according to the circumstances. Fifth, to consolidate the troops, we must care for the soldiers. Enhance the atmosphere of revolutionary friendship, mobilize mutual love and mutual help, and constantly carry out political education. We must conduct vigorous education based on the changing situation and the many practical materials of the troops, in order to consolidate and enhance the combat mood. Sixth, ensuring the improvement of military skills in the course of combat should also become the central task of political work. Ensure a high degree of enthusiasm for training skills and ensure the improvement of combat morale. We should ensure that we train troops whenever there is a gap, and that everyone trains automatically, so that we have a guarantee of military skills in shattering Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Seventh, every comrade must be educated to implement the policy on prisoners of war. Win over prisoners of war, disintegrate the enemy army, everyone should not take the personal belongings of prisoners of war, everyone should propagandize to the enemy soldiers, making them passive and disgusted with the civil war, even to the point of striking, and finally rising up and standing on the side of the people. Eighth, the successful completion of all the above work is inseparable from the leadership and activities of the Party. In the self-defense war, the work of the Party branches in the troops must be strengthened. First of all, we must raise the special responsibility of ordinary Party members in the war. Whether in understanding the task, bravely fighting, enforcing military and political discipline, consolidating troops and practicing skills, or disintegrating the enemy army, they must show their significant initiative. And through them, unite the broad masses of non-Party soldiers to complete all tasks.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 直属队同志出发前线巡视工作  张副政委召集讲话  指出目前政治工作中心任务\n\n1946-08-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　直属队同志出发前线巡视工作\n　　张副政委召集讲话\n　　指出目前政治工作中心任务\n    【本报邯郸二十日讯】军区张副政委际春同志顷就目前政治工作的中心任务，召集直属队出发前线巡视工作的同志讲话。首称：蒋介石国民党在美帝国主义分子援助下所发动的破坏和平民主，与出卖民族国家的反动的大举进攻已经开始了。继围攻我们中原五师之后，接着进攻我们的豫东、山东、苏中、淮北、晋南，最近更向热河、豫东挑衅。他的飞机亦到处轰炸，炸了淮阴、济宁等地，最近更炸延安。在大后方则到处压制民主，最近更惨杀民主人士。蒋介石现在是要逼迫全人民于死地。我们今天的任务是消灭蒋介石进攻的部队，粉碎蒋介石的大举进攻。只有粉碎了蒋介石的进攻，才能恢复和平，实现民主保证民族的独立。继即指出，今天政治工作的第一个中心，是使每个指战员认识今天的形势，和爱国自卫战争的神圣任务，提高大家的觉悟程度，政治责任心，与作战勇气，相信我们的作战是正当的合理的行动。我们有全国人民和民主人士的坚决赞助，我们的自卫作战是代表全国人民要求，关系于和平民主，关系于民族的生存独立。大家必须认真的执行这一爱国自卫战争的任务，使全体官兵加强团结克服一切困难，争取战争的胜利。第二、保证部队军事纪律的执行。必须更有组织有纪律，万众一心，统一行动与步调，听命令指挥，这样才更有力量，更易于粉碎蒋介石的进攻。第三、保证争取群众和政治纪律的实行。作战是为了人民的和平民主和民族的解放，离开了人民就不能胜利。全体人员和群众接触时，必须宣传群众，说明蒋介石破坏政协决议，破坏和平民主，惨杀人民及民主人士，以及美帝国主义分子援助蒋介石打内战的罪行。说明我们为什么要自卫，粉碎蒋介石的进攻。但还必须首先保证全体人员在行动上爱护群众利益，严格执行三大纪律八项注意。对于少数犯纪律者经过教育后，必须动员大家来监督他们的行动，同时还必须处罚犯纪律的。这点很重要，必须经常教育检查，真正要做到秋毫无犯。第四、保证经济纪律的执行。我们在自卫战争中一定要收复一些城市乡村，并缴获许多物资，这些必须保证归公。至于在作战中，许多部队有困难要解决，有的部队作战有功要奖励，应整个根据情况来作。第五、巩固部队必须关心战士。提高革命友爱的空气，动员互相爱护，互相帮助，不断的进行政治教育。必须根据时局变化，用部队的许多实际材料，进行有力的教育，以巩固提高作战情绪。第六、在作战过程中，保证提高军事技术，也应成为政工中心任务。保证高度的锻炼技术的情绪和保证作战情绪提高。应保证一有空隙就练兵，大家自动练，这样就使我们在粉碎蒋介石的进攻中，军事技术有了保证。第七、必须教育每一个同志执行俘虏政策。争取俘虏，瓦解敌军，大家不拿俘虏私人的东西，大家向敌军士兵作宣传，使其消极厌恶内战，以至罢战，最后起义站到人民方面来。第八、上述一切工作的做好完成，是与党的领导与活动分不开的。在自卫作战中，部队中党的支部工作必须加强。首先要提高一般党员在战争中的特殊责任，无论在认识任务，勇敢作战，执行军事政治纪律，巩固部队练技术，瓦解敌军的各方面，都要表现出他们显著的积极性。并通过他们去团结广大非党士兵，完成一切任务。"

The Associated Press stated that the main points of disagreement were: (1) The time limit for British troops to withdraw from Egypt. Egypt believes that one year is sufficient, while Britain sets it at three years. (2) The issue of the British-Egyptian alliance. Egypt believes that it should only assist Britain if Britain is attacked, while Britain requires Egypt to assist Britain when Middle Eastern countries are attacked. (3) The Sudan issue.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 22nd: According to the Central News Agency and the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, education in major cities under Kuomintang rule faces a major crisis. In the four cities of Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan alone, more than 670,000 young people and children are out of school. In Beiping, known as the national education center, 480,000 children are currently out of school. Some schools have no equipment at all, using bricks as chairs and boards as tables. Tianjin has more than 90,000 children out of school, and Qingdao has more than 42,700. Shanghai schools have decided that the number of young people and children dropping out due to lack of tuition fees will increase significantly this semester. The campus of Nanjing Central University is still occupied by the military, and there is no date set for the start of the next semester. Guangzhou has a total of 100,000 primary school students, but the existing primary schools only accommodate more than 40,000, less than half of those seeking education. Ren Huapeng, the principal of Guangzhou Municipal Normal School, recently wrote an article in the Ta Kung Pao entitled \"Difficulty in Studying,\" pointing out that school fees are extremely high, costing each student more than 300,000 yuan per semester, which most parents cannot afford. Even if they have the money, the complicated procedures such as transfer certificates make enrollment very difficult. Seeking education is as difficult as seeking a job, involving endless efforts to curry favor and seek advice. Ren also mentioned that as the principal of a normal school, he could not get his own son into primary school despite many attempts.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 22nd: More than a thousand primary school teachers in Shanghai have not received contracts for the next semester. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao: On the 23rd of last month, the Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Job Security Association and the Primary School Teachers' Job Security Promotion Association jointly hosted reporters, stating that schools have already dismissed teachers in more than a dozen cases. Out of more than 1,900 primary school teachers in the city, only 480 have received contracts, accounting for only one-fifth of the total. They stated: \"This is not just a personal career problem for teachers, but a problem of the entire education construction.\" Finally, they made four demands to the education authorities, including guaranteeing teachers' jobs, and appealed to society for support.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 22nd: According to the Shanghai United Evening News, the Kuomintang authorities have decided to increase tuition fees for all schools in Shanghai next semester. University tuition fees are approximately between 150,000 and 300,000 yuan. As a result, many university and middle school students have to engage in various small businesses in the scorching heat to cope with the soaring tuition fees. Science students at Nantong College have created a \"selling vegetables to help with tuition\" method. Participating students are divided into groups by region to inquire with residents about their daily vegetable needs, then purchase vegetables in bulk at the market and deliver them to households throughout the day. Some students at Yuying Middle School sell popsicles or cigarettes on the streets, while students at Zhijiang University make and sell oil and paper fans, with advertisements for stores printed on the paper fans. Female students at Zhijiang University make candy and mooncakes. Students at Nanping Girls' Middle School collectively sew and sell women's bras. Students at Jiancheng Middle School have organized a consumer cooperative to sell candles, and the practice of making and selling handkerchief paper flowers is even more common.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋统治区教育面临严重危机  学生失学教师失业  当局决定提高上海各校学费学生被迫在酷暑中做小生意\n\n1946-08-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋统治区教育面临严重危机\n　　学生失学教师失业\n　　当局决定提高上海各校学费学生被迫在酷暑中做小生意\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】据中央社及上海大公报透露，国民党统治下之各大城市教育面临极大危机，仅平、津、青、济四地失学的青年儿童，即达六十七万余名。素称全国教育中心的北平市，现有失学儿童四十八万名，某些学校设备全无，以砖头当椅子，板子当桌子。天津失学儿童有九万余名，青岛失学儿童也达四万二千七百余人，上海各校决定于本年上学期因无学费失学的青年儿童将大量增加。南京中大校舍至今仍被军队占用，下学期开学无期。广州共有小学生十万，现有之小学一共仅有小学生四万余人，与求学人数相差一半以上。广州市立师范学校校长任华朋近以“读书难”为题，在大公报著论指出各校收费奇昂，每生每学期需费三十余万元，一般家长无力负担，即使有钱，也因转学证等手续繁杂，入学亦甚困难。求学难如求职，钻营请教，无所不用其极。任氏并称他身为师范校长，有一子竟无法进小学，诸多设法，仍被摒校外。\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】沪市小学教师已有千余人未接到下学期聘书。据沪大公报载：上月二十三日，沪中学教师职业保障会及小学教师职业保障促进会联合招待记者称：校方解聘教师已达十数起，全市小学教师一千九百余人，其中接到聘书者仅四百八十人，占全数五分之一。并称：这不仅是教师个人职业问题，而是整个教育建设问题。最后向教育当局提出保障教师职业等四项要求，并吁请社会声援。\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】据沪联合晚报称：国民党当局决定提高沪市各校下学期学费，大学学费约在十五万至三十万之间。以致一般大中学生不能不在酷暑中经营各种小生意，以应付高涨之学费。南通学院里科学生创造“卖菜助学”办法，参加同学按地区分组换户探询居民每日所需要菜，再至市场批购，全天一批按户分送。育英中学一部分同学则往街头叫卖冰棒或贩卖香烟，之江大学同学制发油及纸扇出卖，在纸扇上则登商店广告。之江女生则制糖果月饼。南屏女中同学集体缝制女用胸围推销。建成同学则组织消费合作社售制蜡烛出售，至制售手巾纸花者更为普遍。"

    "content": "Favorable Weather and Careful Farming, All Liberated Areas Celebrate a Bumper Harvest\n        Taiyue Area\n    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, reports] This year, the Taiyue area has enjoyed favorable weather, promising a bumper harvest for both seasons. The entire area has over ten million mu of cultivated land, with wheat fields accounting for five million mu. The summer wheat harvest totaled 390 million jin, exceeding the average summer wheat harvest by 50%, the largest harvest in ten years. The summer rains were particularly well-distributed, and the eight million mu of autumn crops are growing very lushly, with full ears of grain extending a foot long. According to experienced old farmers, the average autumn harvest is expected to be 140 jin of millet per mu, for a total of 1.12 billion jin of autumn grain across the area. If the total yield of the summer and autumn seasons is combined, this year each person can harvest 503 jin of fine grains, greatly improving the lives of the peasants. Two million mu of wheat fields have already been plowed. As the saying goes, \"Rain in June is good for planting wheat,\" and a good wheat harvest next year is also expected.\n        Taihang Area\n    [Our newspaper, Changzhi, reports] The Shangdang Basin stretches for hundreds of miles, and the autumn crops are very lush. The \"Golden Queen\" corn plants are over ten feet tall, each with two ears. The kernels on the ears of grain are extremely full. People on the road are saying, \"Good crops, good crops.\" It is said that \"this year could be a ten-out-of-ten year, with each mu of land yielding two shi.\" Also, new autumn produce has already hit the market in Changzhi, with green corn costing three or four yuan per ear and yams costing five yuan per jin. In the vegetable market, eggplants, cabbage, and radishes are piled high like mountains. A vegetable seller from Zifang Village in the west of the city told the reporter that this year there has been ample rainfall, and there are many vegetables. Those who grow vegetables are making money, and it is convenient for those who eat them. This year, the area planted with special crops in Changzhi has greatly increased compared to last year. More than 1,000 mu of indigo were planted this year, a fifteen-fold increase over last year. 6,500 mu of tobacco were planted, a doubling compared to last year. Hemp, a famous product of Shangdang, was planted on more than 7,000 mu last year, and this year a total of more than 23,000 mu were planted. The new hemp plants are over ten feet tall and have already been cut down. It is estimated that each mu can yield 70-80 jin of hemp, and planting one mu of hemp is equivalent to seven or eight mu of autumn crops.\n            Luzhong Area\n    [Xinhua News Agency, LinYi, 22nd] The autumn crops in the Luzhong Liberated Area are growing strongly, and the prospect of a bumper harvest is unlike anything seen in the past decade. On the Tai'an Laiwu Plain, a famous wheat-producing area, the ears of grain are up to a foot long and reach five or six feet high. Corn and sorghum are also plump and lovely. It is estimated that each mu (960 square steps per large mu) can yield 2,000 jin of millet, and corn and sorghum can produce 1,000 jin. In Li Guizhang Village in Laiwu, a labor hero known for pottery, the average autumn harvest yield for the entire village is 750 jin of grain per person, enough to eat for two years. In the Yi Mountain area, each mu (720 square steps per large mu) can yield 900 jin of millet, and each cotton plant has more than 70 bolls, all of which are plump and solid. Currently, the masses throughout the area are formulating autumn harvest plans, and women will also join in the autumn harvest upsurge.\n            Jin-Cha-Ji Area\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 22nd] The summer harvest in the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area was quite abundant, with the total area planted with wheat expanding to more than 12 million mu. With an average yield of seven dou of wheat per mu, the total wheat production is more than 8.4 million shi. In the famous \"wheat warehouse\" of Hebei, the Central Hebei Plain, 8.95 million mu of wheat were sown, accounting for more than 30% of its total cultivated area. In most areas, the wheat is growing very well, with heavy ears of wheat reaching waist-high. According to statistics from Leting, Fengrun, Yutian, Ninghe, and Baodi counties in Eastern Hebei, there are more than 1.12 million mu of wheat fields, with some areas yielding more than one shi per mu, and usually six or seven dou or more. In the four special districts of Western Hebei, including Yi County, Xushui, Mancheng, and Laishui, more than one million mu of wheat were planted. In Xushui County alone, more than 300,000 mu were planted. In the three special districts of Zhengding, wheat fields accounted for about 26% of the total cultivated land, with an average yield of more than eight dou per mu.\n            Suimeng Area\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Jining, 15th] A good autumn harvest is expected in the newly liberated Suimeng area this year. The wheat, millet, and grain in various places, as well as the wheat in the plains, are more robust than in previous years. The \"small sun and moon\" crops, hastily planted after the rain, are also growing rapidly. In the Dafangdian Village area of the fifth district of Jining, the seedlings are already waist-high, unseen in recent years. According to old farmers, the main reason for this year's bumper harvest is that, under the leadership of the democratic government, the planting of opium poppies has been banned, and a large amount of labor that used to be devoted to opium poppy cultivation has been invested in cultivating millet and wheat fields. Secondly, the expansion of water conservancy projects has greatly reduced flooding compared to previous years, allowing the masses to focus on production. Furthermore, government agencies and troops in various places have conscientiously implemented the Suimeng government's decision to stop mobilizing manpower and animal power. After the labor exchange, the number of weeding times has generally increased, and most of the millet, grain, and wheat have been weeded two to three times. Currently, in Jining, Taoji, and other places, the wheat ears are two inches long and very full, and harvesting will begin soon. In the Hezhi Liangcheng plain area, harvesting has already begun. In previous years, laborers from inside the pass (northwestern Shanxi) came to this area to find work or do short-term jobs. This year, because the people in the liberated areas inside the pass have gained large amounts of land, and the Kuomintang areas are obstructing them, there will be a shortage of labor during the autumn harvest here. The democratic government is studying ways to organize labor exchange and mutual assistance.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 风调雨顺精耕细作  各解放区同庆丰收\n\n1946-08-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　风调雨顺精耕细作  各解放区同庆丰收\n          太岳区\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳今年风调雨顺，可望两季丰收，全区共耕地一千余万亩，麦田即占五百万亩，夏季共收获小麦三万万九千万斤，超过往年夏麦收获量百分之五十，为十年来所未有之丰收。夏季特别雨水调匀，八百万亩秋禾非常茂盛，谷穗盈尺。据有经验老农说：秋季每亩平均可收获小米一百四十斤，全区共可产秋粮十一万万二千万斤。若以夏秋两季总产量合计，今年每人可收获细粮五百零三斤，农民生活因之将大加改善。现有麦田二百万亩已经耕过。语云“六月有雨好种麦”，明年麦收有望亦可预期。\n        太行区\n    【本报长治讯】上党盆地纵横数百里，秋禾甚为繁茂。金皇后玉茭身高丈许，均秀两穗。谷穗颗粒极为饱满。路上行人都说“好庄稼，好庄稼”。据称：“今年可有十分年景，每亩地平常可收两石。”又长治街上新秋已上市，青玉茭三、四元钱一穗，山药蛋五元一斤。菜市上茄子、白菜、萝卜堆积如山，城西紫坊村一个卖菜的向记者说：今年雨水不缺，菜蔬很多，种菜的发财，吃菜的方便。今年长治特种作物较去年大为增加，蓝今年种一千多亩，比去年增十五倍，烟叶种六千五百亩，比去年增加一倍。上党名产之麻，去年种七千多亩，今年共种二万三千多亩。新麻身高丈余，均已割倒，据估计每亩可下麻七八十斤，种一亩麻可顶七、八亩秋。\n            鲁中区\n    【新华社临沂二十二日电】鲁中解放区秋禾苗壮，丰收之象为近十年所未有，著名小麦产区泰安莱芜平原上，谷穗长可盈尺，高及五六尺。玉蜀黍与高粱均肥硕可爱。预计谷子每亩（九百六十方步大亩）可收二千斤，玉蜀黍及高粱可产一千斤，莱芜陶磁劳动英雄李贵章村，全村今年秋收产量平均每人可得粮七百五十斤，足够二年食用。沂山区谷子每亩（七百二十方步大亩）可收九百斤，棉花每株结桃七十余，且均丰满结实。现全区群众正纷纷拟订秋收计划，妇女亦将投入秋收热潮。\n            晋察冀\n    【新华社张家口二十二日电】晋察冀解放区今年夏收尚称丰盈，计小麦种植总面积扩大至一千二百余万亩，平均每亩以产麦七斗计，共产麦八百四十余万石。河北著名的“小麦仓库”冀中平原，播种小麦即达八百九十五万余亩，约占其总耕地面积百分之三十以上。大部地区麦子成长极佳，沉重的麦穗高达腰际。冀东据乐亭、丰润、玉田、宁河、宝坻县统计，麦田即达一百一十二万二千余亩，每亩产量有逾一石者，通常亦在六、七斗以上，冀西四专区易县、徐水、满城、涞水等十县，种麦一百余万亩，徐水一县即达三十余万亩，三专区正定麦田达总耕地百分之二十六左右，每亩平均产量为八斗余。\n            绥蒙区\n    【新华社集宁十五日电】今年绥蒙新解放区秋收有望，各地麦、粟、谷及平川地区麦子均较往年茁壮，雨后抢种之小日月庄稼，亦迅速生长。集＠①五区大房店村一带禾苗高及半人，为数年来所未有。据老农说：今年所以丰收，主要是在民主政府领导下禁种洋烟（鸦片），以过去经营洋烟的大量劳动力投入耕种粟麦地。其次为水利事业增加，水患较往年大减，群众能安心生产，以及各地机关部队均切实执行绥蒙政府停止动员人力畜力的决定。变工后，锄地次数普遍增加，粟谷及麦子大部锄过两次至三次。现在集宁陶集等地，麦穗长二寸许，十分饱满，不日即可收割，和枝凉城平川地区，已开始收割。往年口内（晋西北）区劳动力多来此地揽工或打短工，今年因为口内解放区人民大量获得土地，而国民党地区又受当局阻拦，故此间秋收将感劳力缺乏。民主政府正研究组织劳力变工互助。\n    字库未存字注释：\n        ＠①原字宓下加冉"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Moscow Radio commentator Masinu, in a commentary on the situation in China, stated: The victory of the Anti-Japanese War did not bring peace to the Chinese people. The past year has been one in which Chinese reactionaries, with the help of the United States, provoked civil war and opposed democratic forces. Chinese democrats point out that Chiang Kai-shek's recent speech is a final ultimatum for peace. He shifts all responsibility to the Communist Party and deliberately raises various unreasonable demands in order to push the situation to a breaking point. Regarding the opinions of Chinese democrats on disarming the Communist armed forces, Luo Longji, a leader of the Democratic League, said, \"Disarming the CCP is impossible, because without armed forces there is no guarantee for the existence of democratic parties. Under these circumstances, two members of the Democratic League have already been assassinated, and one has been kidnapped in Beiping. But if the reactionaries run rampant, then the matter will not be limited to assassinations but will completely eliminate all democratic forces. If there were no People's Revolutionary Army, then the entire democratic force would have been completely extinguished a year ago. Therefore, the existence of the People's Revolutionary Army is a guarantee for the existence and development of democratic forces in China.\" Masinu stated: In the past year, the reactionaries have tried more than once to realize their plan to eliminate democratic forces. Only the victory of the People's Revolutionary Army's self-defense war and the uprising of Kuomintang troops such as Gao Shuxun and Hao Pengju forced the reactionaries to sign the ceasefire order and resume negotiations. But this was only the reactionaries buying time to prepare for a new offensive. Masinu continued: The failure of the reactionaries in the civil war has caused anxiety among international reactionaries, so the United States is very concerned about the Chinese civil war. Last October, the US Marines landed in North China with the help of the Japanese army, and the US military began to join the Chinese civil war. The US military, taking advantage of the People's Revolutionary Army's attitude of avoiding conflict with the US military, entered the liberated areas and continuously shipped Kuomintang troops and weapons by ships and airplanes to attack the People's Revolutionary Army. And after each time the Kuomintang army suffered a serious defeat, Marshall would come to carry out their so-called \"mediation\" activities. During the \"mediation,\" the United States continued to transport Kuomintang troops to the front line to prepare for a new offensive. But just like in the national liberation war, a movement to strive for unity with the People's Revolutionary Army to resist Japan unfolded in the Kuomintang army, thus giving rise to the anti-Japanese allied forces. Now, during the civil war, a force to strive for unity with the People's Revolutionary Army to oppose the civil war and fight for peace and democracy has unfolded in the Kuomintang army. A patriotic movement of national unity was generated on a democratic basis. This democratic national united front was further consolidated and expanded in July. In the entire month of July, the Kuomintang army lost 53,000 men (Note: Actually 70,000 men). Not only did it not achieve the goal of eliminating the New Fourth Army, but the People's Revolutionary Army's strength was further supplemented and developed due to the defection of Kuomintang officers and soldiers. And the speeches of Soong Ching Ling, He Xiangning, and other progressive figures of the Kuomintang show the expansion of this force against the civil war and demanding democracy. But with the support of the American reactionaries, the reactionaries continue to provoke civil war. After bombing Yan'an, Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech ten days later. Chinese democrats believe that this speech is preparing public opinion for a full-scale civil war. The day after Chiang's speech, Kuomintang planes bombed Zhangjiakou and Yanggao stations. Soong Ching Ling declared that the Chinese and American reactionaries are cooperating and encouraging each other in provoking civil war; this encouragement has been particularly strengthened in late July and early August. On the eve of the bombing of Yan'an, there was a conflict between the US military and the People's Army in North China (Note: namely the Anping Incident). On the eve of Chiang Kai-shek's speech, Marshall and Stuart issued a joint statement stating that \"mediation\" had failed. The US State Department also stated that the US policy towards China remains unchanged. The US military is still stationed in China, although the work of sending back Japanese troops was completed on July 15. Masinu concluded that: In the past year, the reactionaries have not realized their plan for a full-scale civil war. Chinese democrats believe that this is mainly due to the strong strength of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Army it leads. The continued unity of democratic forces in China and the continued consolidation and expansion of the national united front make it possible for the Chinese people to overcome the long-delayed full-scale civil war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努：论中国局势\n\n1946-08-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努：论中国局势\n    【新华社延安二十二日电】莫斯科今日广播评论员马西努论中国局势称：抗日胜利没有给中国人民带来和平，过去一年是中国反动分子在美国帮助之下挑起内战，反对民主力量的一年。中国民主人士指出蒋介石最近的讲演是对和平的最后通牒。他把一切应负的责任都推到共产党身上，故意提出种种无理的要求，以使局势达到决裂。中国民主人士关于解除共产党武装力量的意见，民盟领袖罗隆基关于这点说：“解除中共武装是不可能的，因为没有武装就没有民主政党的存在保障。在这种情形下，民盟即已有两位委员被暗杀，一位在北平被绑架。可是如果反动分子横行起来，那末事情就不仅限于暗杀而是会完全消灭一切民主力量。如果没有人民革命军，那末整个民主力量还在一年前就被完全扑灭了。因此人民革命军的存在是中国民主力量存在与发展的保障。”马西努称：过去一年间反动派不止一次企图实现其消灭民主力量的计划，只是由于人民革命军自卫战的胜利与国民党军队如高树勋、郝鹏举等的起义，才迫使反动派签字于停战令与恢复谈判。可是这只是反动派争取时间准备新的进攻而已。马西努继称：在内战中反动派的失败引起国际反动派的不安，因此美国对于中国内战就非常关心。去年十月美国海军陆战队在日军帮助下在华北登陆，美军便开始加入了中国的内战。美军利用人民革命军避免与美军冲突的态度进入解放区，用舰只与飞机不断装运国民党军队与武器去进攻人民革命军，而在每次国民党军遭受到严重失败之后，马歇尔就来干他们所谓“调停”的活动了。在“调停”中，美国又继续运国民党军到前线，准备新的进攻。可是正像在民族解放战争中，在国民党军队中曾展开争取与人民革命军联合抗日的运动，因而产生了民族抗日的联军。现在在内战时期，在国民党军队中又展开了争取与人民革命军联合反对内战建立为和平民主而奋斗的力量。在民主基础上产生了民族团结的爱国运动。这种民主民族统一战线在七月份是更加巩固与扩大了，七月整月的战争中，国民党军队损失了五万三千人（按：实际为七万人）。它不但没有达到消灭新四军的目的，反而由于国民党军队官兵的投诚，更加补充与发展了人民革命军的力量。而宋庆龄、何香凝及国民党其他进步人士的言论，更可以看出这种反对内战要求民主力量的扩大。可是在美国反动派支持之下，反动派继续挑拨内战，轰炸延安之后，经过十天，蒋介石便发表了演说。中国民主人士认为：这种演说是准备社会舆论以便进行全国内战。蒋演说的第二天，国民党飞机就轰炸了张家口与阳高车站。宋庆龄声明说，中美反动派在挑拨内战上互相合作彼此鼓励；这种鼓励在七月底八月初已特别加强。轰炸延安的前夜发生了美军在华北与人民军的冲突事件（按：即安平事件）。蒋介石演说前夜，马、司发表了联合声明，说明“调停”失败。美国务院也声明说美对华政策不变。美军仍驻在中国，虽然遣送日军的工作已在七月十五日完成了。马西努结论称：过去的一年，反动派并没有实现其全面内战的计划，中国民主人士认为这主要应归功于中国共产党及其领导的人民军具有强大的力量。中国民主力量的继续团结，民族统一战线继续巩固与扩大，使得中国人民有可能克服拖延很久的全面内战。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th: Changchun dispatch: Since the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters of the Kuomintang suddenly announced the ban on 100-yuan Red Army currency notes, it has caused great chaos in the market here. This 9.725 billion yuan of Red Army currency was originally issued by the Soviet military authorities stationed in Northeast China with the consent of the Kuomintang government to be used as military expenses. This sudden announcement of the ban, allowing only one-tenth of the face value for exchange and limiting registration and redemption to within ten days, has caused public anxiety. The day before the ban was the end-of-month payday, and the salaries issued to civil servants and others were all in Red Army currency, which became waste paper the next day. After the ban was announced, the entire city was in panic. Gao Chengye, who made a living by collecting scraps and sundries, recently sold his collected items for 23,000 yuan and was planning to repay his debts. He suffered this blow and committed suicide because he could not make a living. However, Chiang's troops and police still forced people to buy goods at the original value with this currency, forcing many shops to close. Near Dongda Bridge, Kuomintang military police even caused a conflict when they forcibly bought pork with Red Army currency. Kuomintang agencies took the opportunity to make money and commit fraud, underreporting the amount of Red Army currency they held and smuggling large amounts of Red Army currency to the Liberated Areas to steal materials, causing prices to rise everywhere. The Kuomintang authorities in Northeast China not only did not try to remedy this situation, but adopted high-pressure measures. On August 3rd, Wang Wenjia, the special commissioner of the Central Bank in Northeast China, openly threatened citizens and vendors, saying, \"Those who attempt to disrupt the market with rumors and vendors who refuse to use it will be severely punished,\" but the public's dissatisfaction has only increased. The Huasheng Daily commented on the matter, saying, \"This method has created a huge wave in people's lives, making people feel pain and disappointment,\" because this matter \"is really too important to the economic life of the people in Northeast China.\" Even the Northeast Kuomintang newspaper, the Xinsheng Daily, had to admit that this matter had caused \"great commotion among the people in Changchun, Shenyang, and other parts of Northeast China,\" and admitted that \"in the past two or three days, what we have seen and heard is nothing but sad faces and resentful voices.\" The newspaper also said: A year ago, when the Red Army currency was first circulated, the authorities issued a notice allowing the public to use it at a one-to-one ratio. Five months ago, the authorities issued another notice advising the public not to panic themselves. When the news of this ban on the Red Army currency was released, the authorities even stated that they would never allow the public to suffer excessive losses. Unexpectedly, this time the notice is such a method, how can it not make the public lose confidence in the government?\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 20th: Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters announced on the 1st that the use of 100-yuan Red Army currency notes would be stopped, and a large number of Red Army currency notes were squeezed into the Liberated Areas to plunder materials. Democratic governments in Northeast China had no choice but to take countermeasures, announcing on the 8th that the currency would be suspended from use and taking appropriate measures to relieve the people's hardships. The Nenjiang Provincial Government stipulated the following measures: (1) First register the 100-yuan Red Army currency in Qiqihar, count the total amount of currency in the city, the currency will be temporarily kept by private individuals, and grain will be transported to Qiqihar to regulate the grain supply. (2) Northeast Bank local circulating notes of ten, fifty, and one hundred yuan are allowed to circulate at marked prices. (3) Grain loans will be provided to the urban poor, commercial loans to small and medium-sized merchants, and agricultural loans to farmers. The provincial government has now allocated 1.1 million yuan to issue temporary interest-free loans, with 1 million yuan to relieve the poor in Qiqihar.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北国民党当局禁用红军票  市面紊乱民众不满  民主政府设法解民困\n\n1946-08-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北国民党当局禁用红军票\n    市面紊乱民众不满\n    民主政府设法解民困\n    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】长春讯：自国民党东北行营经济委员会突然宣布禁用红军票百元券后，引起此间市面大紊乱。此项九十七亿二千五百万元的红军钞票，原为苏联驻东北军事当局取得国民党政府同意而发行充作军费者。此次突然宣布停用，并只准兑换币值十分之一，限十日内登记收兑。停用前一日为月底发薪期，公务员等所发之薪悉系红军票，次日顿成废纸。宣布停用后，全市人心惶惶。以收买破烂杂物为业的高承业，日前将其所收买的物品卖得二万三千元，正拟偿还欠债，突遭此打击，因无法生活，乃自杀而死。但蒋方军警犹持该票强迫以原值购物，致使许多商店被迫停业。东大桥一带，国民党军警于持红军票强买猪肉时竟酿成冲突；国民党各机关并乘机发财舞弊，将现存之红军票以少报多，将大量红军票偷运至解放区盗买物资，致使各地物价高涨。国民党东北当局对此非但不设法补救，却采用高压手段。八月三日，中央银行东北特派员王文笳竟公然恫吓市民商贩称：“对企图扰乱市面造谣之徒及拒绝使用之商贩将予以严厉处分”，而群众之不满却愈益增加。华声报于评论此事时称：“这个办法给人民生活掀起了巨波，使人民感觉痛苦失望”，因此事“关系东北人民经济生活实在太大”。甚至连东北国民党机关报新生报亦不得不承认此事在“长春沈阳两市及东北各地民众都起了莫大骚动”，承认“两三日来眼里所见到的耳里所听到的，无非愁苦之容和悲愤之声”。该报并称：一年以前，当红军票最初流通时，当局曾出布告让民众一比一的使用，五个月前，当局又布告劝民众勿自惊扰。而当此次禁用红军票之消息传出时，当局更曾表示决不使民众过度损失。想不到现在这一次的布告竟是这样一个办法，怎能不使民众对于政府失去了信心？\n    【新华社齐齐哈尔二十日电】蒋介石东北行辕于一日宣布停止红军票百元券使用，并将大批红军票挤向解放区，掠夺物资。东北各地民主政府不得不采取抵制办法，于八日宣布该票暂停使用，并采取适当措施以解民困。嫩江省府规定了下列办法：（一）先于齐市登记百元红军票，统计全市票额，该票暂由私人保存，并运粮至齐市调剂粮食。（二）东北银行地方流通券十元、五十元、一百元三种准予标价流通。（三）将对城市贫民举行粮贷，对中小商人举行商贷，对农民举行农贷。省府现已拨款一百一十万元发放临时的无息贷款，以一百万元救济齐市贫民。"

    "content": "Hebei-Luyu People's Joining-the-Army Tide\n    Hebei-Luyu Communication\n    Since Chiang Kai-shek's troops have launched large-scale offensives against our liberated areas in the Northeast, Central Plains, Shanxi, Northern Jiangsu, and Shandong, the peasants in the Huxi Liberated Area who have turned over under the leadership of the Communist Party have been sending their children to the battlefield one after another. Zhu Gongdun of Peixian County said to his son: \"Xiao, go! In the past, we begged for food and were treated like animals. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, we would still be suffering from the cold!\" After hearing his father's words, the son joined the army. Yongqing and his wife went to the chairman to register their son. Mother Meng of Renzhuang persuaded her son to join the army, saying, \"The farmers' association will take care of the family affairs, so you can go without worry!\" The model militia squad leader of Fengxian Chengguan District signed up to join the army, saying, \"I used to be so hungry that my eyes turned yellow and black. Today, the Communist Party saved us, so we have to work hard.\" Liu Bangqi of Xige Village in Peixian County, his whole family turned over after the Communist Party came, and they had food to eat. When he heard that Old Chiang was fighting a civil war, because he didn't have a young son to join the army, he led his wife and six-year-old daughter to welcome the new soldiers. He carried a pot of wine, knelt in front of the new soldiers, and offered them wine for the journey, and said angrily: \"Comrades, the Communist Party led me to turn over, and my heart will never forget it. You go to the front to defeat Old Chiang's offensive, your parents are my parents, I will do whatever I can, and if anyone is sick, I will take care of the decoction.\" The young men of Peixian County were even more angry when they heard the news that Chiang Kai-shek was fighting a civil war and would not allow the people to turn over. Five hundred people automatically signed up to enlist. In each district, thousands of people welcomed them in the rain or shine, with carts, mules, and horses. Some young men who did not meet the standards or were not old enough cried and made a fuss when they were persuaded to go home: \"Can't we fight Chiang Kai-shek? We will stay here no matter what, and we will not go back even if we die!...\" After three mobilizations, there were still four young comrades who resolutely refused to go back, and they were only happy when they were allowed to join the army. When you ask them why they want to join the army, their answers are as firm as steel, \"Defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive,\" \"Defend the fruits of victory,\" and \"Thoroughly turn over.\" At present, in all districts of the county, fathers send their sons, wives persuade their husbands, and members of the farmers' association and militia are vying to join the army. Model figures are emerging continuously. The upsurge of joining the army and opposing the civil war is boiling among the 100,000 people in Peixian County, and everyone has a firm confidence in victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫人民参军潮  冀鲁豫通讯\n\n1946-08-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫人民参军潮\n    冀鲁豫通讯\n    自从蒋介石的队伍向咱们东北、中原、山西、苏北、山东等解放区大规模进攻以来。我湖西解放区在共产党领导下翻了身的农民，都纷纷送他们的子弟上战场。沛县朱公敦向他儿说：“小呀，你去吧！过去要饭与人当牛马，要不是共产党八路军、咱们还得受苦寒哩”！儿子听了父亲的话后，就参军去了。永清夫妇到会长那里与儿报名。任庄孟母劝子参军，说：“家里的事有农会来照顾，你放心去吧！”丰县城关区民兵模范班长报名参军，他说：“从前常常饿得两眼黄黑，今天共产党救了咱，咱得干”。沛县溪阁村的刘邦其，他全家在共产党来到后翻了身，有了饭吃，他听说老蒋打内战，因没有年轻的儿子去参军，他就领着他的老婆和六岁的女孩子去欢送新战士，他提着一壶酒，跪在新战士的面前敬送行酒，并愤愤的说：“同志，共产党领导我翻了身，我心永不能忘，你们到前方去打败老蒋的进攻，你的爹娘就是我的爹娘，大小活我只要能干就去干，倘若谁家有了病，煎汤熬药俺来管。”沛县的青年小伙子，听到蒋贼打内战不叫人民翻身的消息，更是愤怒，自动报名入伍的就有五百名，各区千百群众风雨无阻，大车小车、骡马花舆的去欢送，一些不合标准不够年龄的小伙子，当劝他们回家时，每次所得的结果是惹得他们乱哭乱吵：“俺们打蒋介石不中吗？赖也要赖在这里，死也不回去！……”经过三次的动员，还有四位小同志坚决不愿回去，直到允许他参军时才高兴了。你问他们为什么要去参军，他们的回答像钢铁一样的坚决，“打退蒋介石的进攻”，“保卫胜利果实”，“彻底翻身”。目前全县各区爹送子，妇劝夫，农会员、民兵等，都争着参军，模范人物不断涌现，参军反内战的热潮，在沛县十万群众中沸腾着，大家都有着坚定的胜利信心。"

The original telegram is as follows:\n　　Commander Jiang Jiabin,\n　　Having read your telegram, we are filled with admiration! Your troops defended the country and protected the people during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Kuomintang authorities not only failed to commend and cherish you but instead ordered you to participate in the traitorous civil war, making you enemies of the people. The so-called \"atonement for crimes through meritorious service\" is in reality a mad and unheard-of act of harming the country and the people and eliminating dissidents. This time, Your Excellency has led all the officers and soldiers of the 18th Column in holding high the banner of righteousness for democracy and national salvation, resolutely withdrawing from the traitorous civil war. This is not only a head-on blow to the instigators of the civil war but also a powerful support for the national democratic and patriotic movement, greatly benefiting the nation and the country.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 23rd: The water level in the Grand Canal continues to rise, and some areas have been flooded. A reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Construction Department of the Border Government to inquire about the recent situation. According to reports, there have been continuous heavy rains this month, measuring 7.7 inches, exceeding the rainfall in April of last year by 4.7 inches. The canal water has risen sharply. Taking Qingjiang as an example: on the 14th, the water level was 24 feet 3 inches, on the 17th it was 25 feet 6 inches, and on the 18th it was 26 feet 6 inches, with a continuing upward trend. However, as long as the Lanjiang and Guashan dams among the ten Guijiang dams controlled by the Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou are opened, the canal's rising water can be diverted into the Yangtze River to avoid disaster. However, although the democratic government has repeatedly requested their opening, the two dams remain blocked to this day. The Kuomintang authorities in Donghai County have also blocked the Qiangwei River in the Huaihai area, preventing the Shu River from flowing smoothly into the sea, which further increases the burden on the canal, causing waterlogging in low-lying areas in northern Huaihai and along Hongze Lake. As for Mr. Chen Cheng's statement that \"Mr. Zhou Enlai submitted a memorandum to the Executive Yuan regarding the rising water level in the canal, requesting the opening of five dams on the canal. I believe that with both the Yangtze River and Hongze Lake experiencing rising water levels, whether opening the five dams on the canal can accommodate the discharge volume should be jointly surveyed by both parties and experts,\" it is particularly ignorant and laughable. According to historical precedent, the water from the Huai River entering the Yangtze River dates back 200 years. The Huai River Diversion Plan formulated by the Kuomintang Huai River Diversion Committee also stipulates \"30% into the sea (now even the sea is not allowed), 70% into the Yangtze River.\" What is the need for a \"joint survey\"? According to Mr. Chen's opinion, if the vast Yangtze River cannot accommodate the canal's discharge, then such a large amount of water blocked in the canal can only burst its banks. The Kuomintang authorities are not only preventing the canal's rising water from flowing into the Yangtze River and the sea, but also doing everything possible to sabotage the major dike construction and flood prevention projects. Their intentions are already obvious. Currently, our democratic government, in addition to leading the military and civilians to step up flood prevention projects, is also urging various places along the river and lake to immediately harvest and transport the ripe crops to higher ground, doing everything possible to minimize losses. However, we still hope that the Kuomintang authorities will immediately stop blocking and all destructive water conservancy behaviors, valuing the lives of the people and upholding humanity.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党坚不开坝阴谋昭然  运河续涨部分地区成灾\n\n1946-08-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党坚不开坝阴谋昭然\n    运河续涨部分地区成灾\n    【新华社淮阴二十三日电】运河水势续涨，部分地区已泛滥成灾。记者特走访边府建设厅负责人探询近况，据谈本月以来，曾连遭霪雨，计量七寸七分，超过去年四月份雨量四寸七分。运河水陡涨不已。以清江为例：十四日水位为二丈四尺三寸，十七日为二丈五尺六寸，十八日即为二丈六尺六寸，且有续涨之势。但只要控制在扬州国民党当局手中归江十坝中之拦江、褂山两坝开放，运河涨水入江即可免于成灾。但该两坝虽经民主政府一再请其开放，然迄今堵塞如故。东海国民党当局，且在淮海地区堵塞蔷薇河，使沭水无法畅流入海，因而更加重运河负担，致淮海北部及洪泽湖沿岸一带洼地已遭受水滥之灾。至陈诚氏所称：“周恩来先生以运河水涨，曾向行政院提出备忘录，要求开放运河五坝。余意值兹长江洪泽均告水涨，开放运河五坝后，能否容纳排泄量，应由双方及专家合勘”等语，尤为无知可笑。按淮运之水入江已有二百年历史，国民党导淮委员会所订导淮计划亦有“三分入海，（现在海也不准入）七分入江”之规定，何须“合勘”？依陈氏意见，浩浩大江尚不能容纳运河排泄量，则如许水量堵在运河里，当然只有横决一途。国民党当局，不但阻止运河涨水归江与归海，并对大眺防泛工程，百般破坏之用意何在，已昭然若揭。现我民主政府除领导军民加紧防泛工程外，同时督促沿河沿湖各地，对已熟禾稼立即收割运置高地，尽一切可能争取少受损失。但仍望国民党当局，立即停止堵塞及一切破坏水利行为，以重民命而维人道。"

    "content": "[Reported by this newspaper from Yangcheng] The Taiyue Liberated Area's military and civilians will be completely self-sufficient in clothing fabric this year. This year, the entire region planted a total of 300,000 mu of cotton. Since the start of the hot season, there has been ample rainfall, and the cotton seedlings are growing vigorously. It is estimated that each mu of mountain land can yield 20 jin of clean cotton, while each mu of plain land can yield 40 jin of clean cotton, for a total yield of 9 million jin of clean cotton. Due to the large-scale cotton planting throughout the region, the textile industry has also developed rapidly. Currently, there are 330,000 organized women spinners and 30,000 weavers in the region. The annual output is estimated at 8.25 million jin of spun cotton and 4.12 million bolts of cloth. For the region's 3 million population, this averages 4.5 zhang per person. The region will be largely self-sufficient in cloth this winter.\n\n[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi] It has been a year since the complete liberation of Xiyang County. Both the county's cooperatives and women's spinning have experienced leaps in development. The old liberated areas have already achieved \"cooperatives in every village, spinning in every household.\" The development in the new liberated areas is also extremely rapid. Even the women in the Chengguan district, who were formerly considered idle and degenerate after eight years of enemy and puppet rule, have joined the enthusiastic spinning movement.\n\nCurrently, there are 225 cooperatives in the county. Most cooperatives have developed from organizing transportation for profit to then developing spinning and weaving. Cooperatives in the old liberated areas have played a significant role in organizing mass production. For example, the Dongfengren Cooperative has not only developed rural sideline occupations but also increased livestock power and solved fertilizer problems for agriculture. As a result, it has been warmly supported by the masses, who call it \"the overall manager of the village.\" Women in Xiyang did not traditionally spin or weave. Spinning and weaving in the old liberated areas began during the famine in 1932. After the county was liberated, the women's spinning and weaving work in both the new and old liberated areas developed rapidly under the call of our democratic government. Chengguan and the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 9th districts have all successively established spinning and weaving training classes. The trained women then return to their villages to hold small-scale village trainings. In the 1st district, the total number of women is 4,566, and 2,657 have learned to spin and weave, accounting for 56 percent. The number of spinning wheels and looms has doubled. Small-scale textile factories have been established in West Street in the city, Southeast Guan, and Haojia Village in Dongfengren. In order to study how to improve quality and technology, efforts are being made this year to achieve \"self-sufficiency in clothing\" in the old liberated areas and semi-self-sufficiency in the new liberated areas.\n(Zeng Yu, Xin Ying)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳全区穿衣自给  昔阳新区纺织普遍发展\n增誉　新颖\n1946-08-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳全区穿衣自给\n    昔阳新区纺织普遍发展\n    【本报阳城讯】太岳解放区军民衣布，今年可完全自给。今年全区共植棉三十万亩，入伏以来雨水充足，棉苗茂盛，估计山地每亩可摘净花二十斤，平川地区每亩可摘净花四十斤，共可产净花九百万斤，由于全区大量植棉，纺织业亦迅速发展，现全区有组织的纺妇达三十三万人，织妇三万人，全年可纺花八百二十五万斤，织布四百一十二万匹，全区三百万人口，每人平均四丈五尺，全区今冬布匹即可大部自给。\n    【本报长治讯】昔阳全境解放已一年，全县合作社与妇纺均有飞跃的发展。老区已是“村村合作社，户户纺花”，新区发展亦极迅速。连经敌伪八年统治，向称游堕的城关区妇女，也卷入了热烈的纺织运动。\n    现全县合作社已达二百二十五个，大部合作社均系于组织运输获利后，继即开展纺织而发展的。老区合作社在组织群众生产上作用甚大，如东丰稔合作社不仅发展了农村副业，并为农业增加畜力，解决肥料，因之受到群众的热烈拥护，群众呼之为“村里的总当家”。昔阳妇女向不纺织，老区纺织开始于三十二年渡荒时。全县解放后，新老区妇纺工作在我民主政府的号召下，均一日千里的发展起来。城关及一、三、四、九等区均先后开办纺织训练班，再由受训妇女回村举办村的小型训练，一区妇女总人数为四千五百六十六人，学会纺织的就有二千六百五十七人，占百分之五十六。纺车、织布机倍增。城内西街，东南关及东丰稔郝家等村，均开办有小型纺织工厂。为研究提高质量与改进技术，今年完成老区“穿衣自给”，新区半自给而努力。（增誉、新颖）"

Since the occupation of Huo County by the Yan puppet army's 44th Division (whose main force, the 3rd Regiment, was purely formed from puppet security forces), they implemented their so-called \"soldiers and farmers as one,\" \"credit grain purchases,\" and \"apportioned grain purchases\" policies, levying exorbitant taxes and levies, making the people unable to bear it. Recently, they even expanded their burning, killing, and looting to villages more than twenty miles away, causing extreme suffering to the masses. Responding to the demands of the county's 72,000 people, the Eighth Route Army, after capturing the outer strongholds such as Xinzhai Station in the county on the 14th, launched a general offensive on Huo County town at 8:00 PM on the 23rd, ending the battle in just 30 minutes, and Huo County town was liberated.\n\n　　[This newspaper's Tongpu Front, 22nd dispatch] Xinhua News Agency Frontline Reporters Group comprehensive report: The battle results of Hongdong, Zhaocheng, and the battles of Liujiazhuang and Xinzhai Station in Huo County, and Wan'anzhen in Hongdong are as follows: (1) The Hongdong battle resulted in the capture of 330 rifles and carbines, 4 light machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, more than 10 pistols, 26 train cars, 8 telephones, the capture of more than 700 Yan puppet soldiers, 20,000 shi of grain, 20,000 jin of edible salt, and the killing and wounding of more than 100 people, including the big traitor Zhang Niconglong. (2) The Zhaocheng battle resulted in the capture of 2 mountain guns, 4 light and heavy mortars, 4 heavy machine guns, more than 70 light machine guns, more than 60 pistols, more than 600 rifles and carbines, more than 20 telephones, more than 60 li of insulated wire, 4 radio stations, 1 locomotive, 8 train cars, more than 6,000 shi of grain, 2 cars, and the capture of more than 2,000 people (the previous report of more than 700 people was only those captured in the city), and the killing and wounding of more than 600 people. (3) The battles of Liujiazhuang and Xinzhai in Huo County resulted in the capture of 4 mountain guns (two of which were destroyed by the Yan army), 6 mortars, 4 heavy machine guns, more than a dozen pistols, more than 300 rifles and carbines, 20 grenade launchers and small cannons each, 1 telephone switchboard, more than 30 li of insulated wire, 39 mules and horses, 2 locomotives, the killing and wounding of more than 500 people, including Zhou Jianxiang, commander of the 69th Division, and Shi Liquan, commander of the 207th Regiment, and the capture of more than 600 people, including Pan Weizhou, deputy commander of the 207th Regiment. (4) In the pursuit battle west of the Hong and Zhao Rivers, Wan'anzhen (20 li northwest of Hongdong) and its surrounding strongholds were liberated victoriously on the 18th, capturing more than 400 people, including the chief of staff of the 39th Division, killing and wounding more than 400 people, and capturing more than 4,000 shi of grain. The Yan puppet strongholds along the Tongpu Road south from Gousancun in Linfen to Nanguan Town in Lingshi (excluding the Nanguan stronghold), a distance of more than 170 li, have been completely cleared.\n\n　　[This newspaper's Tongpu Front, 22nd dispatch] The Jiang army, which occupied Hengshui, invaded our Jiang County town again at 1:00 PM on the 21st. Currently, they are coordinating with the Jiang army occupying Houma and the Quwo Yan security regiment to continue their invasion of the Qujiangyi Liberated Area. More than 1,300 Yan puppet troops from Quwo, on the 20th, launched an attack in three directions, advancing to Dongmazhuang, Sucun, Nanyang and other villages. After being surrounded by our army and having most of them wiped out, they fled back into the city in panic. At 1:00 PM on the 21st, two regiments of the Jiang army entered Quwo city from Aikou (35 li southwest of Quwo). The war in southern Shanxi is continuing to escalate.

Subsequently, they conducted in-depth inspections and new arrangements for work in the areas of troops, finance and economy, the emancipation movement, production and thrift, and culture, putting forward the slogan of \"everything for the victory of the front line.\" It was decided to first carry out a major ideological mobilization, immediately notify all special districts, counties, and troops to discuss the Liberation Daily editorial and the Central Bureau's call. On the 24th, a cadre conference was held for all agencies at the administrative office level, with Political Commissar Li Xuefeng and Director Li Yiqing personally mobilizing.\n\n[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] In response to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau's call to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and strive for victory in the patriotic war, and to implement the mass emancipation movement, the Wu'an County Government, Bank, Public Security Bureau, Post Office and other agencies convened a cadre mobilization meeting on the 19th to prepare to dispatch a large number of cadres to the countryside to help deepen the mass movement. At the meeting, County Chief Cheng proposed that launching the masses with a free hand is a powerful guarantee for winning the patriotic war, and every cadre should resolutely eliminate landlord sentiments and the incorrect understanding of fearing \"excesses.\" Any thoughts, emotions, and actions that hinder the mass movement will cause immense losses to the work. He called on all cadres to give full play to their high work efficiency, take time out, and participate in the mass movement in the urban areas. He also called on cadres from landlord families to respond to the call of the Taihang District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, mobilize their families to launch a land donation movement, seize the time, continue to implement the mass movement, and prepare to support the front lines. The emancipation teams participating in the mass movement in the urban areas have already begun their work actively. (Yi Fan)\n\n[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The newly emancipated people of the Third District of Wu'an are doing their utmost to strengthen their self-defense armed forces in order to repel enemy invasions and protect their hard-won interests. After 270 capable militiamen joined the People's Liberation Army, young people successively poured into the militia. According to incomplete statistics, there are already more than 700 people. Farmers bought guns and weapons for the militia with a large number of struggle gains. Daluoyuan bought eight rifles and two pistols at once, Tonghui bought a machine gun, and Boyan bought twenty-six rifles, two machine guns, and two hand cannons. Most of the militiamen practice shooting and throwing grenades during the tense production gaps, preparing for self-defense operations. The Boyan militia has gone to the front line to participate in the war. At the time of departure, they vowed to the villagers: We will definitely win glory for our village, not desert, and also exchange for good rifles.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th (Delayed Dispatch) The 25th Group convened on the 17th to hear the report of a witness designated by the US side. All three parties questioned the report extensively. Several points have been affirmed by the US witness, Fritz (staff of the US Supply Office of the Executive Headquarters), namely: (1) About four or five miles from the scene of the incident, a unit of Chinese troops wearing khaki uniforms and holding the Blue Sky White Sun flag encountered US Marines. The unit headed east towards the scene of the incident. (2) The US Marines who went from Tianjin to Beiping on July 29 had only the small English letters \"WSA\" on their vehicles and no flags or other identification marks. Mr. Fritz also directly admitted that he was the commander of the conflict. He claimed that he was only notified to take command one and a half hours after the battle began. In the afternoon, Duke of the Beiping Military Police reported that on the 28th, he went from Beiping to Tianjin. After the car passed Anping for several miles, he saw a government army garrison and an officer who told Duke that Anping was garrisoned by the Eighth Route Army and hoped that the US military would send a team to Anping.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th (Delayed Dispatch) Although today is Sunday, the 25th Special Group still held a meeting for four hours. The meeting was chaired by the Kuomintang representative Zhang Shuheng. Starting at 9:00 AM, representatives from all three parties questioned Lieutenant Colonel Belcher, commander of the 1st Battalion, 11th Regiment, 1st Marine Division of the US Marine Corps. When answering a question from Major General Huang Yifeng, the CCP representative, Belcher clearly pointed out that when the US patrol team departed from Tianjin on July 29, it was expected that an accident might occur near Anping on that day, because the headquarters of the 1st Marine Division had learned that the convoy was ordered to go from Pingjin on July 26, and it had a conflict with the garrison in the area. Therefore, the organization of the patrol team was different from usual. Not only were some soldiers and weapons equipped, but also special communication equipment was available. Before the patrol team set off, Lieutenant Colonel Belcher also conveyed the order to deal with the incident, that is, if they encountered obstacles on the way, they should try their best to eliminate them. Secondly, the patrol team on that day was organized by the division headquarters, and its members included some combat personnel from the 1st Regiment and the 11th Regiment. More importantly, Belcher was even more certain that the ten-mile-wide area near Anping did not belong to the jurisdiction of the government army, because he had traveled back and forth between Pingjin many times and had never seen any trace of the government army in the area. Belcher believed that there were CCP troops there. Belcher also said that among the vehicles escorted by the patrol team on that day, there was a UNRRA car, and it was not clear what it was carrying, but it was known that there were four Chinese people in it. The CCP representative then asked whether Duke’s claim yesterday that this car was a customs car was true? Belcher replied that it was indeed a UNRRA vehicle, and said that Duke was a passenger in the car and did not know the truth about the patrol team, so his words were not credible.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th The liaison group of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, which departed for Xianghe on the 17th, has established contact with the CCP headquarters in the area and met with Commander Zeng Yongya. Commander Zeng expressed a warm welcome to the upcoming investigation by the 25th Special Group, and agreed to meet the investigation team at the address of Xianghe Middle School on the 21st, and stipulate the route of the liaison group entering the CCP area. Due to difficult roads, the liaison group arrived in Xianghe late in the evening of the 18th, and the group returned to Beiping at 3:00 pm on the 19th.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Beiping, 20th (Delayed Dispatch) Today, the 25th Special Group decided to depart for Xianghe at 7:00 am on the 21st to listen to the testimony of witnesses from the CCP side. A special correspondent of this agency and two reporters from the Kuomintang and the US side will also accompany them. When the group met today, Major General Huang Yifeng, the CCP representative, presided over the meeting and first listened to the report and answered questions from Lieutenant Kennard of the US Military Police. The dispute caused in today's meeting was due to the fact that the translator of the Kuomintang side changed the content of his representative's speech without authorization. After the chairman pointed out the error, the translator admired it, and the Kuomintang representative tried hard to defend it, and threatened to refuse to continue questioning the witness. Chairman Huang Yifeng then explained that every translator must faithfully translate the accurate words of their representative, which is not only the chairman's wish, but also the hope of the Kuomintang representative. US Representative Colonel Madden also agreed with the chairman's explanation. After the three parties finished questioning Lieutenant Kennard, they discussed the letter from General Zeng Yongya to the group brought back from Xianghe by the liaison group. The letter said that the Chiang-puppet army has been constantly attacking Xianghe since August 3, and no less than hundreds of shells have fallen outside the city. In order to ensure the safety of the 25th Group's investigation in the area, the group must be requested to make effective prevention. To this end, the three parties agreed to hand over the original letter to the 25th Group for group processing, and the representatives of the KMT and the CCP in the meeting each notified the KMT and the CCP troops to immediately stop the conflict so that the investigation work of the 25th Special Group could proceed smoothly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安平镇事件连日进行调查  肇事者显为蒋美两方  贝尔查证明安平原为中共军管辖  美军巡逻队出发前曾作战斗准备\n\n1946-08-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安平镇事件连日进行调查\n    肇事者显为蒋美两方\n    贝尔查证明安平原为中共军管辖\n    美军巡逻队出发前曾作战斗准备\n    【新华社北平十八日电】（迟到）第二十五小组于十七日集会听取美方所指定证人之报告，三方对该报告询问甚广，有数点已为美方证人傅瑞兹（执行部美方供给处人员）所肯定，即：（一）离肇事地点四五英里处，有穿卡机布之中国军队一部，持青天白日旗与美海军陆战队相遇，该部队向肇事地点东开。（二）七月二十九日由津赴平之美海军陆战队，除汽车上书有英文“ＷＳＡ”数小字外，并无任何旗帜或其他识别记号。傅氏并直认渠为冲突指挥者，渠称于战斗开始一时半后，始接获通知担任指挥。下午由北平美宪兵队丢克报告，据称：渠于二十八日由平赴津，当汽车越过安平数英里后，见有政府军队驻军一军官，曾语丢克称：安平系八路军驻守，希美军派队伍去安平云云。\n    【新华社北平十八日电】（迟到）本日虽为星期日，二十五特别小组仍举行会议达四小时，由国方代表张叔衡任主席，上午九时起，三方代表对美海军陆战队第一师十一团第一营营长贝尔查中校提出询问，贝氏于回答中共代表黄逸峰少将之问题时，曾明白指出七月二十九日美方巡逻队自津出发时，已预计当日在安平附近可能发生事故，因陆战队第一师师部曾获悉七月二十六日训令运输队自平赴津途中曾在该地与驻军发生冲突之情报，故巡逻队之组织有异于平时，不仅增加若干兵员、武器配备，且备有特殊通讯设备。而在巡逻队出发前，贝尔查中校并曾传达应付事变之命令，即途中倘遇阻碍时，应尽力排除之。其次，当日之巡逻队系由师部编组，其成员包括第一团及十一团之若干战斗人员。更重要者，贝氏更确知安平附近十里宽之地段不属于政府军之管辖区，因彼往返平津多次，迄未见该地有政府军踪迹，贝氏相信该处有中共部队。贝氏又称：当日巡逻队所护送之车辆中，曾有行总汽车一辆，所载何物不明，但知其中乘坐华人四名。中共代表继询以昨日丢克曾称此车为海关车是否确实？贝氏答称确为行总车辆，并称丢克为一乘车之旅客，对巡逻队之实情不明，其言未足凭信云云。\n    【新华社北平十九日电】十七日出发香河之北平执行部联络小组已与该地中共司令部取得联络，并曾会见曾雍雅司令。曾司令对二十五特别小组行将前往调查极表欢迎，并约定于二十一日在香河中学地址接见调查小组，及规定进入中共地区之联络小组之路线。因道路难行，联络小组十八日傍晚始达香河，该小组已于十九日午三时返抵北平。\n    【新华社北平二十日电】（迟到）本日二十五特别小组决定于二十一日晨七时出发香河，以听取中共方面证人的证言。本社特派记者及国民党与美方两方记者各二人亦将随同前往。本日小组集会时，由中共代表黄逸峰少将任主席，首听取美军宪兵队坎拿特中尉报告和答复询问。今日会中引起的争论，是由于国民党方面译员的译其代表的发言时，擅自改变内容，经主席指出其错误后，该译员佩服，国方代表亦力加袒护，并以拒绝继续向证人发问相威胁。主席黄逸峰少将乃解释称：每一译员必须忠实译出自方代表的准确言词，这不仅是主席的愿望，也是国民党方面代表所希望的。美代表马丹上校亦同意主席的解说。三方于坎拿特中尉询问完毕后，即讨论联络小组从香河带回的曾雍雅将军给小组的信件，该信说：蒋伪军自八月三日以来，即不断进攻香河，该城郊外所落炮弹，不下数百发。为保障二十五小组在该地调查的安全，须请小组作有效的制止。对此三方同意将原信交二十五小组分组处理，而由会中的国共双方代表各自通知国共双方军队，立即停止冲突，使二十五特别小组的调查工作得以顺利进行。"

According to the written explanation, during this period, the Su, Wan, and Lu liberated areas rescued 17 American airmen. It stated that on August 22, 1944, an American Flying Fortress crashed, and Lieutenant Colonel Savoy and five other pilots landed on the coast of northern Jiangsu. They were surrounded and captured by Japanese troops, but the New Fourth Army repelled the Japanese and rescued them. On November 11 of the same year, an American plane caught fire while bombing the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Major Francis, Major Morgan, and three other airmen parachuted along the railway on both sides of Yang and Jia Shan in Anhui Province. The New Fourth Army fought the Japanese for more than ten days to rescue them and escorted them to a safe area. On June 12, 1945, a Flying Fortress crashed, and Captain Redmond and two other pilots landed in Haimen, Jiangsu. They were rescued by the New Fourth Army. On December 18 of the same year, six American Navy First Air Fleet planes crashed in Daze Mountain, Jiaodong. Lieutenant Abrant and three other pilots were rescued by the New Fourth Army.

Attendees included teachers from various primary schools, volunteer teachers, intellectuals, shop assistants, and others, totaling more than 40 people. Director Zhang reported on the current situation and called on everyone to do propaganda work anytime, anywhere. He also encouraged everyone to establish activity blackboards and literacy boards on the streets and to promote elementary school students to do sanitation inspections as a side job.\n    ×                            ×                      ×\n　　Cadres and primary school teachers in Guxin Town, She County, founded children's noon schools to combine production and learning. Every day after lunch, impoverished children outside the school and children who cannot attend school due to the busy farming season can voluntarily attend school for one hour, and take literacy boards to the fields for self-study. The results of the experiment were very good, and young women were also drawn to the noon schools. Currently, the entire village has established a total of 19 noon schools, based on each street and alley, with 368 children and women participating. The girls' noon school led by Liu Taoxing in the Fourth Street also actively repaired the school building in two days. The noon school led by the director of the women's school has more than 30 young women, all of whom automatically go to school immediately after lunch. The nearby villages of Xiaoche, Yuanqu, and Huangyan have also followed suit and generally established morning schools. The government is actively continuing to promote this.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 文教简讯\n\n1946-08-26\n第2版()\n专栏：文教简讯\n\n　　文教简讯\n    太行时事研究社所编辑之《文摘月刊》于十五日创刊。该刊为干部研究国内外时事问题之重要参考读物，专选辑国内外各大杂志的时事论文。创刊号内即有斯大林爱国战争总结，苏联新五年计划全文、邱吉尔反苏演说及斯大林之驳邱演说等。\n    ×                        ×                      ×\n    武安民教馆于本月初召开时事座谈会。到会者有各个小学教员、义务教员、知识分子、店员等四十余人。张馆长报告当前时局后，号召大家随时随地做宣传工作。并勉励大家在各街头建立活动黑板报识字牌，推动小学生顺便做卫生检查工作。\n    ×                            ×                      ×\n    涉县固新镇干部与小学教员，创立儿童午校，使生产与学习相结合。每天午饭后校外贫苦儿童及因农忙不能上学儿童可自愿到校上课一小时，并领识字牌到地里自学。经过试验成绩很好，影响青年妇女也涌进午校。现全村以各街各巷口为单位共建立午校十九座，参加儿童妇女三百六十八人。第四街刘桃杏领导的女儿童午校，两天中还积极修理校舍，妇校主任领导的午校有三十多个青年妇女，都是一吃午饭马上自动到校。该镇附近小车、原曲、黄岩等村，亦均仿效普遍成立上午校。政府正积极继续推广中。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 22nd: The textile industry in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has gradually become self-sufficient, and some areas are already able to export in large quantities. With Gaoyang in central Hebei as the center, it has developed to Qingyuan, Lixian, Suning, Anxin and other places. In addition to meeting local needs, it exports a large amount to the provinces of Rehe and Ningxia. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Gaoyang had 60,000 looms, with an annual output of 1.7 million bolts of cloth. During the occupation, only 3,000 looms remained. Since its liberation last year, the Jizhong Bank has provided 15 million yuan in loans to support it. By June of this year, the scale has exceeded ten times that of the occupation period. 74% of the villages in the county, the majority of farmers and women have participated in textile production. The number of women spinners united in cooperatives and mutual aid groups alone has reached more than 20,000, spinning 120,000 catties of yarn per month. More than 18,000 people in the county weave 90,000 bolts of cloth per month. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50,000 women in seven counties including Yixian, Mancheng, and Xushui have participated in textile production. Yixian alone has more than 38,000 spinning wheels and more than 4,200 looms, and has woven more than 240,000 bolts of cloth in the past six months. With the new cotton on the market in the second half of the year and the winter slack season, it is estimated that the output will exceed the first half of the year. In the three special districts of Ji-Jin, according to statistics from Pingshan County and one district of Jianping County alone, the number of spinning wheels has increased from more than 20,000 last year to more than 30,000. Wanxian weaves 1,000 bolts of cloth and 1,000 dozens of towels every day, and can export 150,000 bolts of cotton cloth and 200,000 dozens of towels throughout the year. In the northeast of Shanxi, north of Yanmen Pass and parts of Chahar, where there was no textile industry before, the textile industry is also gradually developing. In one district of Lingqiu alone, 1,000 spinning wheels have been added this year. In the three districts of Yu and Guo counties, more than 1,300 people have participated in textile production, weaving more than 2,400 bolts of cloth and spinning 12,600 catties of yarn in the past six months.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋察冀纺织渐足自给  部分地区已大量输出\n\n1946-08-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋察冀纺织渐足自给\n    部分地区已大量输出\n    【新华社张家口二十二日电】晋察冀边区纺织业已逐渐走向自给，部分地区已能大量输出。冀中以高阳为中心，发展到清苑、蠡县、肃宁、安新等地，出产除自给外，大量输出热、宁各省。高阳抗战前，曾拥有布机六万架，年产布一百七十万匹。沦陷时仅剩下三千张织布机。去年解放后，冀中银行贷款一千五百万元扶助，至今六月规模已超过沦陷时十倍以上。全县百分之七十四村庄，大部农民与妇女参加了纺织。仅团结于合作社互助组周围的纺妇，即达二万余人，每月纺纱十二万斤。全县一万八千余人织布月产布九万匹。易县、满城、徐水等七个县，据不完全统计，已有五万余妇女参加了纺织。仅易县即有纺车三万八千余架，织机四千二百余架，半年来织布二十四万余匹。后半年新花上市，冬季农闲估计出产将超过上半年。冀晋三专区纺织业，仅据平山县与建屏县一个区的统计，纺车已由去年的二万余辆增至三万余辆，完县每日织布千匹，手巾千打，全年可输出棉布十五万匹，手巾二十万打。素无纺织基础的晋东北、雁北与察哈尔部分地区，纺织业也在逐渐发展。灵邱一个区，今年即增加纺车一千辆。盂、崞两县的三个区，也有一千三百余人参加了纺织，半年来已织布二千四百余匹，纺纱一万二千六百余斤。"

When passing through Chongqing, they told reporters: After the CDL's proposal to form an investigation committee jointly by the government, the CDL, and the United States was rejected, the government only allowed a separate investigation. Therefore, in principle, the government should guarantee the safety of the CDL investigators and provide them with convenience. Unexpectedly, Gu Zhutong and Tang Zong obstructed the investigation one day before departure. Kunming is still in extreme terror. Although it is known that this investigation will be difficult, they are determined to do their best regardless of everything and be prepared to deal with any obstacles. When talking about the Sun Zhongyuan incident in Beiping, Mr. Liang dismissed the rumors with a smile, saying that the CDL headquarters had received a personal letter from Sun Zhongyuan's wife reporting everything. Mr. Liang and others originally planned to go to Kunming on the 4th, but due to government obstruction, they were delayed until the 6th before they could leave.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 23rd: Chongqing News: According to a senior official within the Kuomintang in Kunming, the murderer of Li and Wen was instigated by a certain commander-in-chief who is now loudly calling for catching the thief. He ordered Wang, the bigwig of the reactionary organization \"Democratic Freedom League\" which he supports, to send people to do the dirty work. The commander-in-chief had promised Wang a seat as a \"National Assembly Representative.\" Li Chengye, the Kuomintang secret agent who assassinated Li Gongpu, is a member of the \"Democratic Freedom League.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民盟梁漱溟氏  赴昆明调查李闻暗杀案  国民党当局竟无理阻难\n\n1946-08-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民盟梁漱溟氏\n    赴昆明调查李闻暗杀案\n    国民党当局竟无理阻难\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】渝讯：民盟秘书长梁漱溟氏及法学专家周新民氏，三日由京赴昆调查李闻案，当途经重庆时，曾对记者谈称：在民盟提议由政府、民盟、美国三方同组调查委员会被拒绝后，政府只允单独调查，因此照理政府应保障民盟调查人之安全，并予以便利，不料在出发前一天，顾祝同及唐纵二人即对调查加以阻碍。现在昆明仍在极端恐怖中，此去调查，虽明知困难，但决不顾一切，竭力以赴，并准备应付任何阻碍。谈及北平孙中原事件时，梁氏对外传消息置之一笑，谓民盟总部已接到孙中原夫人之亲笔函报告一切。梁氏等本拟四日赴昆，因政府阻难，延至六日始克成行。\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】渝讯：据昆明国民党内某高级官员传出：暗杀李闻二氏的凶手正是今日大呼捉贼的某总司令所主使，命令他一手所扶持的反动组织——“民主自由大同盟”的大头子王某派人干的勾当。该总司令曾应允给王某一个“国大代表”。暗杀李公朴的国民党特务李成业就是“民主自由大同盟”的盟员。"

    "content": "Impressions of a Trip to the United States\n    Ailunbao\n    Anti-Soviet thinkers like to describe the Soviet Union as a \"barracks,\" where all the people live, but in reality, I don't know of any other country in the world that has achieved such complete standardization as the United States.\n\n    I have traveled to dozens of American cities, and besides New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, and Boston, I have found that many cities have completely lost their original characteristics. They are simply concentrations of a certain number of Americans.\n\n    Things are also standardized. Everywhere you see the same pants, coffee cans, lounge chairs, the same houses, the same furniture, pottery, and fabrics. Nevertheless, we do not agree with the European aesthetes who mock American standardization.\n\n    Even more regrettable is a kind of moral standardization: Americans really like to talk about their interests, although their views are based on emotional preferences, and ultimately their actions are dominated by external forces. Newspapers and movies fully deprive people of their individuality—this is why entertainment always accompanies economic depression in the United States.\n\n    Americans know very well how to make money, but they have not yet learned how to spend it. They show much greater ability in work than in rest. In the United States, most entertainment is probably on their outdoor playgrounds. Young people at the seaside look very happy, but in the movie theaters, you can see half-asleep, indifferent audiences, who rarely respond to even the most ridiculous scenes with a smile. Although most states have some restrictions on the sale of alcohol, there are drunkards everywhere.\n\n    In a relatively short period of time, Americans have created remarkable technologies. Some Americans, seeing those factories, those beautiful bridges in New York, automatic diners, and exquisite razors, often think that the entire culture of mankind is concentrated in the United States. In Jackson, Michigan, someone said to me: \"Rome is an ordinary, dirty city, with nothing to see, no skyscrapers, only some miserable little bungalows; Jackson is like a capital city compared to Rome.\" How can I explain to such a person that the ancient Renaissance palaces are worthy of comparison with Jackson's skyscrapers, or that besides drugstores where you can buy cigars, fountain pens, and even eat sausage, there are also Byzantine artworks and Raphael's frescoes?\n\n    Americans have insufficient knowledge of the ancient world, and their studies of ancient history and geography are very inadequate. I met a group of students who couldn't even name a single city in the Soviet Union. The political level is also very low. American newspapers often write that the two-party system is a true guarantee of democracy. It should be pointed out that there is no ideological division between the two parties, or rather, one cannot find any differences of opinion between the Republicans in the North and the Democrats in the South.\n\n    The development path of the United States is very different from that of old Europe. While America's material culture has rapidly reached a high level, its spiritual culture is still in its infancy. Since we know that Americans are full of energy, we have the right to say that the spiritual culture of this great nation should be great and independent.\n\n    The political awareness of the American people has already undergone some changes. Not only loyal but also thoughtful people, all those who are able to recognize historical developments, are united around Roosevelt. Even if they have now been dismissed (or they have resigned), the activities of the former president have not disappeared without a trace.\n\n    Workers have begun to express independent thought and solidarity, and an awareness of their national mission. The era when workers were guided by strategists and gamblers is over. American writers are not as connected to the people as French writers are.\n\n    In the film industry, genuine humor has emerged—the genius of Chaplin, the Marx Brothers (famous American actors), and there is also genuine poetry that can move people.\n\n    Finally, the architecture of New York is still beautiful, though restless. The American intellectuals already exist, they are still fragile and struggling, seeming to hide behind billboards, behind the noisy music of taverns, behind the sermons of churches, they are hiding behind passive negation, sadness, and sometimes the smile of utopian thought. But even among the intellectuals, there are increasingly brave people who know that the way to salvation lies not in escape or solitude, but in something else—it is necessary to raise the spiritual level of the American people to the same level as the technological level that is inextricably linked to their entire path from birth to death.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 游美观感\n爱伦堡\n1946-08-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　游美观感\n    爱伦堡\n    反苏的思想家喜欢把苏联描述成为一座“营房”，所有的人民都住在里面，但是实际上，我不知道世界上有任何别的国家曾达到像美国那样十足的标准化的。\n    我游历过数十个美国的城市，而且除了纽约、旧金山、新奥尔良和波士顿外，我还发现有许多城市完全没有了它们自己原来的特点，它们只简单地表示了一定数目的美国人之集中而已。\n    事情也是标准化了的，到处可以看到同样的裤子，咖啡罐、躺椅，同样的房屋，同样的家具、陶器和衣料。虽然如此，我们并不同意欧洲审美家嘲笑美国标准化的意见。\n    更可遗憾的，则是某种道德上的标准化：美国人非常喜欢讲他们的兴趣，虽然他们的观点是嗜好感情，而最后他们的行动是受外部支配的。报纸和电影充分剥夺了人民的个性——这就是在美国萧条时总伴随着娱乐的原因。\n    美国人很知道怎样赚钱，但是他们还没有学会怎样花钱，他们对于工作比对休息所表现的能力要大得多。在美国，大部分娱乐的事情也许就在他们露天游戏场，在海滨青年人的样子很快活，但是在电影院里，你可以看到半睡不醒的冷淡的观众，他们对于很可笑的镜头也很少报以一笑。尽管大部分的州对于卖酒多少有所限制，可是到处有醉汉。\n    在相当短的时间内，美国人创造了显著的技术，有些美国人看到那些工厂，那些纽约的优美的桥梁，自动饮食店以及精致的剃刀，就动辄认为整个人类的文化是集中在美国了。在密执安州杰克逊城，有人对我说：“罗马是一座普通的肮脏的城市，没有什么东西可以看，没有一座摩天楼，只有一些可怜的小洋房；杰克逊与罗马比起来，就像一座京城了”。对于这样的人，我怎样向他解释古代的文艺复兴之宫是值得与杰克逊的摩天楼相比的呢，或者除了可以买到雪茄、自来水笔甚至吃到腊肠的药房以外，也还有拜占廷的艺术品和拉飞尔的壁画呢？\n    美国人对于古代世界的智识是不够的，他们对于古代世界的历史和地理研究是很不充分。我遇到一群学生，甚至连苏联的一个城市名字也说不出来。政治水平也是很低的，美国的报纸经常写道两党制度乃是真正民主的保证。应该指出：两党之间找不到思想上的分野，或者说在北方的共和党人与南方的民主党人之间，人们也找不到有什么意见上的分歧。\n    美国的发展道路与旧的欧洲的发展十分不同，当美国的物质文化迅速地达到了高度的水平，而它的精神文化则还在初创时期。我们既然知道美国人的精力旺盛，就有权利可以说这一大民族的精神文化应当是伟大而独立的。\n    美国老百姓的政治觉悟性已经有了某些改变，不仅忠实的而且有思想的人，凡是有能力认清历史发展的，都团结在罗斯福的周围，即令他们现在被辞退了（或者他们自行告退），而故总统的活动，并不是没有痕迹地消失了。\n    工人们已开始表现独立的思想团结，和对于他们对民族使命之觉悟性，工人们受权术家和赌徒所指导的时代已经结束了。美国的作家不像法国的作家是与人民有联系的。\n    电影方面，已经产生了真正的幽默——天才的卓别麟、马克司兄弟（美国著名演员），也有了能够感动人民的真正的诗。\n    最后，纽约的建筑总还是优美的，虽然是不安静。美利坚知识分子已经存在了，他们还是脆弱的和困难的，似乎躲在广告牌后面、酒肆间的噪闹的音乐后面、教堂的传教后面，他们是躲在消极否定忧伤悲哀、有时是乌托邦思想的微笑后面。但是就在知识分子中，也愈益有了勇敢的人士，他们知道拯救之道不在于逃避或孤独，而在于别的上面——必须提高美国老百姓的精神水平，提高到他们从生到死整个道路上息息相关的技术水平那样的高度。"

    "content": "Textile Hero Song Ai's\n    Lin Li\n    \"She was a hero in her own family, and she's a hero in her husband's family. She's been a hero for three years now. She's truly an outstanding figure in Southern Hebei!\" – When Commissar Han of Jize and the people talked about Song Ai, they always said this repeatedly.\n            Leading Textile Production to Overcome Disaster\n    In the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], Southern Hebei experienced a major famine, which was even more severe in Jize. Families fled famine, and people died in every village. Song Ai's two elder brothers took their wives and nephews to Shanxi, leaving behind their old mother and her. Her husband's family had no food either. Everyone said that she would starve to death. The anti-Japanese government distributed cotton, calling on people to spin and weave to save themselves, weaving a bolt of cloth in exchange for twenty-one jin of grain. But the people, who had been deceived by the old government, doubted that they could get grain in return. It was at this time that Song Ai stepped forward: \"As long as there's food, I dare to do it.\" She took the cotton and went door-to-door to persuade people, but she only found four people. Later, when people saw her constantly bringing back grain, they changed their tune: \"The anti-Japanese government doesn't deceive people.\" At this time, the number of people participating in textile production increased to twenty, and they formed three groups. Everyone weaved cloth in exchange for grain, and they all had food and drink. But as time went on, disagreements arose in the group, with those who worked faster feeling that they were at a disadvantage. Song Ai persuaded and advised them and discussed a solution with everyone: set fifteen work points for each bolt of cloth from spinning to weaving (each bolt of cloth requires three jin of thread), spinning six liang of thread counts as one work point, weaving counts as three work points, reeling counts as half a work point, warping and dressing count as one work point, beaming and threading count as one work point, and beating counts as half a work point, and then distribute the profits according to work points. This motivated everyone. In less than two months, Song Ai's group wove forty-seven bolts of cloth, earning nine hundred and seventy-eight jin of grain.\n            Elected as a Labor Hero\n    During the spring plowing season, the government called on people to pull plows, but the villagers said, \"This is not something that humans are born to do!\" They especially looked down on women. But the starving women responded to Song Ai's call to \"start with textiles\" and implemented an exchange of labor. Women with large feet did fieldwork, while women with small feet spun yarn at home, stipulating that plowing one mu of land was equivalent to spinning nine liang of thread.\n    Since Song Ai led the textile production, not a single person starved to death in Song Village. Song Ai and her mother not only did not starve to death, but also bought two mu of land. That year, the county held a labor hero conference, and she was elected as a textile labor hero.\n            A Thorn in the Side of Feudal Landlords\n    After the disaster passed, her elder brother and sister-in-law returned. They saw that Song Ai had completely changed, running around busily with work every day. People from the village, district, and county all came to talk to her about work. Her brother and sister-in-law were a bit unhappy, secretly saying, \"This girl is going crazy.\" The feudal landlord Song Guozhen in the west of the village took the opportunity to add fuel to the fire, sowing discord: \"Since the Eighth Route Army came, they've liked coming to your house.\" \"What kind of family is this? It's ruining the family reputation.\" Her brother, unable to think for himself, fell for the landlord's trick and pointed out three paths to his sister: (1) Stay at home and never go out. (2) Return to her husband's family and cut off contact. (3) If she continued to \"go crazy,\" it would be a matter of life and death. The women in the village were worried about Song Ai and told the district government about the situation. The district government had long known that Song Guozhen was a KMT [Kuomintang] spy. Later, her brother also realized that he had fallen for the landlord's trick. After she arrived at her husband's home, the corrupt landlords, like Song Guozhen, insulted her, saying, \"A respectable family has produced such a daughter-in-law.\" Under the landlord's instigation, her parents-in-law also revoked her freedom to go out.\n            A Hero in Her Own Family, and a Hero in Her Husband's Family\n    After Song Ai arrived at her husband's home, the district government was calling on Fengguanying to make military shoes, stipulating that seventeen jin of grain would be issued for each pair of shoes. Again, no one in the village wanted to do it. Later, Song Ai mobilized her husband's cousin, Dong Lingniang, asking her to mobilize others and teaching her how to organize women. Soon, the peasant movement in this village toppled the feudal system with great fanfare. Song Ai told Dong Lingniang: \"If there's a stumbling block, women cannot progress.\" So they joined forces with the workers' and peasants' association to launch a struggle against Bao Eniang, who was hated by the entire village for abusing poor women. From then on, the women raised their heads, and Song Ai, like in her own family, led a textile group five or six times larger than the one in Song Village. A new legend was once again praising her: \"With Song Ai in Fengguanying, we can wear new clothes every year.\"\n            Everyone in the Village Spins Yarn and Every Family Weaves Cloth\n    In Song Village, girls in their teens and old ladies in their sixties could spin yarn, and young and middle-aged women could weave cloth. It truly achieved the goal of everyone spinning yarn and every family weaving cloth. The seventeen textile groups under Song Ai's leadership had ninety-seven textile women who \"could weave and spin.\" There were a total of fifty-four looms and ninety-seven spinning wheels. In the first half of the year, they had woven five hundred and thirty bolts of cloth, purchasing a total of one thousand five hundred and ninety jin of cotton, equivalent to four hundred and seventy-seven thousand yuan.\n            The People of Jize Praise Song Ai\n    In Jize, everyone, young and old, knows about Song Ai. She not only leads women in production, but also leads women in emancipation. She is a female leader who is both cultured and martial. Under her long-term influence, families have also been transformed. Now, when she attends meetings and works, her mother-in-law happily takes care of her children, and her backward father-in-law has even been elected as the director of the preferential treatment for soldiers' families. The people of Jize are all praising her. She is a twenty-four-year-old young woman of medium height. She has a special kind of wisdom, and when she talks about work, she shows great魄力 [pòlì - boldness] and courage. She is now a representative of the women's association and is leading the broad masses of women in their emancipation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 纺织英雄宋爱的\n林里\n1946-08-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　纺织英雄宋爱的\n    林里\n    “在娘家是英雄，到了婆家也是英雄，英雄的称号已三年了。她真是冀南的出色人物！”——鸡泽韩政委和人们谈到宋爱的时候，总是再三的这样谈。\n            领导纺织渡灾荒\n    三十三年冀南大灾荒，在鸡泽更厉害，真是家家逃荒，村村死人。宋爱的两个哥哥带着嫂侄上了山西，留下老娘和她。婆家也没吃的，谁不说她两会饿死呢？抗日政府发下棉花，号召纺织自救，织一个布，换二十一斤谷子。但被旧政府骗怕了的人民，都怀疑不能换回粮食。宋爱的就在这时出了头：“只要有吃，我就敢”。她接了棉花，并挨家去劝说，可是只找到了四个人。后来人们见她不断领来粮食，便都改了话头：“抗日政府不哄人”。这时参加纺织的就增加了二十个，编了三个组，大家织布换谷子，都有了吃喝。但日久天长组里又起意见，做活快的嫌吃亏。宋爱的就左说右劝和大家商量了个办法，把一个布从纺到织定为十五个工，纺线六两顶一个工，（每个布三斤线）织布顶三个工，缠缠顶个半工，浆浆络络顶一个工，经经条条掏掏顶一个工，打打顶半个工，然后按工分红。这样大家都起了劲，不到两个月，宋爱的小组就织了四十七个布，赚谷子九百七十八斤。\n            被选为劳动英雄\n    春耕时政府号召人拉犁，村里都说：“这活天生不是人干的！”对妇女更是看不起。但饥饿中的妇女却响应了宋爱的“纺织先去”的号召，并实行了换工。脚大的做地里活，脚小的在家纺花，规定锄一亩地，顶纺九两线。\n    自从宋爱的领导纺织后，宋庄再没有饿死一个人。宋爱的和她娘不但没有饿死，而且还买了二亩地。这年县里召开劳英大会，她被选为纺织劳动英雄。\n            封建地主们的眼中钉\n    灾渡过后，哥嫂回来了。他们看到宋爱的完全变了，天天东跑西跑忙于工作。不论村里区里县里都有人找她谈工作。哥嫂有点看不惯，暗地说：“小妮要疯了”。村西头封建地主宋国桢便趁机火上加油，大施挑拨：“八路军一来，就喜欢到你家。”“这算个什么人家，败坏门风”。哥哥脑筋不开，上了地主的当，向他妹妹指出三条路：（一）在家做活永不出门。（二）回婆家断绝来往。（三）要是再“疯”下去，就是你死我活。村里妇女们都替宋爱的担忧，把这情况都告诉区上。区上早知道宋国祯是国特。后来哥哥也知道上了地主的当。她到了婆家，逢官营的地主和宋国祯一样污辱她说：“老老实实的人家出了这么个媳妇”。公婆在地主挑拨下，也取消了她的出门自由。\n            在娘家是英雄在婆家也是英雄\n    宋爱的到婆家后，区里正叫逢官营做军鞋，规定每双鞋发谷子十七斤。这村同样也是没人愿做。后来宋爱的就动员本家嫂子东领娘，叫她去发动，并教给她组织妇女的办法。不久这村农民轰轰烈烈的闹翻身运动，宋爱的便告诉东领娘：“有了绊脚石，妇女便不能进步。”于是她们便联合工农会，向虐待贫苦妇女为全村痛恨的保娥娘开展斗争。从此妇女们抬起了头，宋爱的又像在娘家一样，她率领了一个比宋庄大五六倍的纺织组。一种新的传说又在替她歌颂着：“逢官营有了宋爱的，年年就能穿新衣”。\n            全村人人纺花家家织布\n    在宋庄，十来岁的小姑娘和六十岁的老太太都能纺花，青壮年妇女都会织布，真正做到了人人纺线，家家织布。在宋爱的领导下的十七个纺织组，就有九十七个纺织娘“能织能纺”。共有五十四架织布机，九十七辆纺花车。前半年已织出了五百三十个布，共购棉花一千五百九十斤，合洋四十七万七千元。\n            鸡泽人民赞颂着宋爱的\n    在鸡泽，提起宋爱的，男女老少人人皆知。她不但领导着妇女生产，而且领导了妇女翻身。她是一个文武双全的妇女领袖。在她的长期影响下，家庭也得到改造。现在她开会工作时，婆婆愉快的给她看孩子，落后的公公居然也被选为优抗主任。鸡泽的人民都在赞颂着她。她是一个二十四岁的青年人，中等身材。她有一种特有智慧，一说起工作，就显示出很大的魄力和勇气。她现在当看妇女会的代表，正领导着广大的妇女闹翻身。"

Young people aged twelve to twenty-six are all conscripted into the army by Du Yuming. Many villagers have come to the city to escape conscription, and the strange phenomenon of buying \"substitutes\" has reappeared in the Northeast. The author visited a village where both the Eighth Route Army and the Chiang troops had stayed. He said: \"The Eighth Route Army gave the impression to the common people of being polite and orderly. They swept the courtyard when they entered, and addressed the elderly as 'Grandpa' and 'Grandma' when they entered the house. As for the Central Army, when they came, they cut down the villagers' apricot, plum, and peach trees, saying they were obstacles and used them for trenches. They ate chickens and pigs, eating whatever they could find. They asked the women for needles, thread, and scissors. When the women hid, they opened the boxes themselves and took them. When they left, every family was short of something.\" When he asked the local people if the \"Central Army\" was good, the people all pursed their lips and said: \"What's good about them? I think they are really not as good as the Eighth Route Army. Those barbarians are terrible!\" The author also said: \"The Chiang troops are busy getting married when they arrive in the Northeast, but Jinzhou was taken from them after they got to Shenyang. This has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the people of the Northeast. Du Yuming has now become the dictator of the Northeast, levying donations and taxes, and even competing to appoint county magistrates. Xu Zhen has appointed a county magistrate, and Du Yuming has also sent a county magistrate there.

Wang claimed to be unfamiliar with the roads, and the Chiang soldiers allowed him to find a replacement along the way. Therefore, he decided to lead the Chiang soldiers to the assembly point of the New Yao Township militia cadres to find a solution. He deliberately took detours along small paths to make the Chiang soldiers lose their way. When he led them to the border of New Yao Township, they encountered Zhou Yuxing, the militia company commander of the township, and several others. Under Wang Laizi's prompting, they were seized by the Chiang soldiers to replace Wang as guides.

After their requests for U.S. passports were rejected by the Kuomintang government, Zhou, Nie, and Li returned to Zhangjiakou via Peiping in mid-month and continued to engage in cultural construction in the liberated areas.

He strongly stated, \"The Kuomintang authorities have recently been vigorously propagating how the Chinese Communists are anti-American, but they have deprived us of the right to develop friendship between the Chinese and American people.\" He expressed his indignation and protest against the Kuomintang authorities' unreasonable behavior and requested sympathy and assistance from American cultural figures. Zhou and others were invited by the U.S. State Department in late June to visit the United States, with the support of Marshall and Stuart.

(3) The price of goods is calculated based on the prices in Hongdong City and Daojue Town (40 miles from Zhaocheng) plus transportation costs and due profits.

Therefore, on the 11th, the Handan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce implemented import/export and foreign exchange controls, stipulating that merchants engaged in import/export are not allowed to purchase foreign exchange. All Customs Gold Units and legal tender without import/export cargo lists from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and special currency carrying permits from the bank are considered illegal if traded privately in the market or carried without authorization. However, the currency trading prices at the exchange are not restricted and remain freely negotiable. This method, which benefits legitimate import/export merchants, leaves no opportunity for speculators to exploit.

In recent days, the reporter has witnessed teams of militia coming from all over to participate in the war on the front lines of the North Canal. Shouldering rifles and carrying landmines, driving dozens of mule carts loaded with supplies, they marched to the self-defense positions, singing military songs with great enthusiasm. Men and women, old and young, along the river are calmly convinced that no matter how much the reactionaries rely on American guns and equipment, their sons and daughters will resolutely defend the North Canal. Although the artillery fire is continuous along the canal, villages such as Qianmazhuang, three or four miles from the embankment, are still working as usual. At a grand mass meeting, the old ladies waved their cattail leaf fans and nodded to the reporter, saying, \"With you young lads (referring to the Eighth Route Army), folks are not afraid of American cannons and machine guns. Didn't the Japanese have these before? Weren't they all defeated by the Eighth Route Army?\" The people warmly care for the soldiers defending their homeland. The reporter personally came into contact with the comfort groups, including five from the First District, two from the Fifth District, one from the Second District, and one organized by merchants from the city. In Koutou Village, Fifth District, more than forty women, each carrying two fat chickens and a basket of eggs, braved the sun to rush to the front lines to comfort the troops. During the fiercest fighting at the beginning of the month, the masses in more than forty villages in the Sixth District were fully mobilized to deliver food and water to the Eighth Route Army day and night and transfer the wounded soldiers. On August 5th, during the heavy rain in the Hutuo River, the shops in the city were afraid that the Eighth Route Army soldiers would catch a cold, so they raised 100 kilograms of white wine and a lot of ginger and pepper overnight and sent them to the front lines.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 23rd: Since July, the militia in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway have killed and wounded more than 250 Chiang and puppet troops in resisting the harassment and ravages of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. On June 25th, Chiang's 94th Division in Changxindian, in conjunction with puppet troops from Liulihe, Fangshan and other places, occupied Cijiawu, where the Liangxiang democratic government was located, and then sent a large number of armed secret agents to search and loot in various villages. The local masses could not bear it, so on July 7th, they cooperated with the Eighth Route Army to recover Cijiawu, annihilating more than 150 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and capturing more than 130 rifles. On July 13th, Yang Shouyan, the Kuomintang county magistrate of Xushui, led a part of the Chiang and puppet troops to break the dikes in Xiguan Huocun and other places, taking advantage of the rising river water, flooding more than ten villages including Dalizhuang and Liuzhuang, destroying more than 200 hectares of fertile land. When the masses beat gongs and gathered to rush to block the breach, they were again subjected to the Chiang and puppet troops' strafing. The nearby militia heard the news and gathered to repel the puppet troops who broke the dike, killing six of them. On July 18th, a battalion of Chiang's army in Caohe, Xushui, surrounded a certain village and used artillery and machine guns to cover nine assaults on the village, all of which were repelled by the militia. At 11:00 a.m., an armored car from Chiang's army in Xushui City came to reinforce. The militia immediately withdrew to the high houses in the village. When Chiang's army entered the center of the street, a dozen landmines exploded together, killing more than ten Chiang's soldiers, and the rest fled. On July 28th, more than 500 Chiang and puppet troops who occupied Chang @ (northwest of Fangshan) were also repelled by the local militia, and they were blocked by the militia along the way.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 香河人民热烈投入自卫战  成队民兵赶赴前线  平汉北段民兵积极打击蒋伪\n\n1946-08-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　香河人民热烈投入自卫战\n    成队民兵赶赴前线\n    平汉北段民兵积极打击蒋伪\n    【新华社遵化二十三日电】本社前线记者报导：香河每一村镇的人民都热烈的投入到正义的自卫战争中。记者连日在北运河火线上，目睹一队队由各地赶来参战的民兵，荷着步枪带着地雷，驱着数十辆满载给养的骡车，热情焕发的唱着军歌，开赴自卫阵地。沿河男女老少，都镇静的坚信：任凭反动派依靠美国枪械装备，子弟兵将坚决的防卫北运河。虽然运河边炮火连天，但是离堤三四里的前马庄等村还在照常进行工作。在一个轰轰烈烈的群众大会上，老大娘们摇着蒲扇向记者点头说：“有了你们这把子年青后生（指八路军），乡亲们还怕什么美国大炮、机枪，日本人原先不也有这些吗？还不是都叫八路军打垮了。”人民亲热的关心保卫家乡的子弟兵。记者所亲身接触到的慰劳团，即有一区五个、五区二个、二区一个和城关商民所组织的一个。五区口头村，四十几个妇女，一人提着两只肥鸡和一篮子鸡蛋，冒着太阳赶到火线上去劳军。月初作战最烈时，六区四十余村的群众，全部动员起来，昼夜给八路军送饭送水转送伤兵。八月五日滹沱大雨时，城关各商店唯恐八路军战士受寒，连夜募集白酒一百斤和许多姜、胡椒送往前线。\n    【新华社张家口二十三日电】平汉北段民兵，七月份以来在反抗蒋伪军的骚扰蹂躏中，毙伤蒋伪军二百五十余名。六月廿五日，长辛店蒋军九十四师联合琉璃河、房山等地伪军，侵占良乡民主政府所在地磁家务后，即派大批武装特务分头到各村搜索抢劫。当地群众无可忍让，乃于七月七日配合八路军恢复磁家务，歼蒋军一百五十余人，缴获步枪一百三十余支。七月十三日，徐水国民党县长杨寿岩，率领蒋伪军一部乘河水猛涨，在西关活村等地决堤四处，淹没大立庄、刘庄等十余村，共毁良田二百余顷。群众鸣锣集会抢堵时，复遭蒋伪军扫射。附近民兵闻讯，乃集合将决堤伪军击退，毙其六名。七月十八日，徐水漕河蒋军一营包围某村，以大炮机枪掩护向村中冲锋九次，均被民兵击退。至中午十一时，徐水城蒋军飞铁甲车一辆增援，民兵即撤入村中高房子上，俟蒋军进入街心时，十数枚地雷一起开了花，炸死蒋军十余人，余均逃窜而去。七月二十八日，侵占长＠（房山西北）之蒋伪军五百余人，亦被当地民兵击退，沿途复遭民兵堵截。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 23rd: According to a Reuters dispatch from London on August 20th: British whaling industrialists have lodged a serious protest regarding MacArthur's arbitrary agreement allowing a large Japanese whaling fleet to operate in the Arctic. An industry leader stated, \"If the Japanese whaling fleet goes out, it will mean the transfer of thousands of tons of whale oil to Japan. Whale oil is extremely important in European food, and especially for Britain in its fat and artificial cheese rations.\" This protest was submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Foreign Office, and it is expected that a note will be sent to Washington. United Press, in reporting the same event, stated: MacArthur's permission for the Japanese whaling fleet to operate will not only be opposed by Britain, but also by Norway and other whaling nations. It also said: At the last Allied Council for Japan meeting, British representative Ball asked why the committee was not consulted in advance regarding allowing Japan to fish? He fundamentally did not understand and pointed out that the committee only discussed allowing Japan to expand its fishing activities in certain seas, but did not discuss allowing Japan to make whaling expeditions thousands of miles from its homeland.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 麦克阿瑟擅允日本北极猎鲸  英国向美提出抗议\n\n1946-08-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　麦克阿瑟擅允日本北极猎鲸\n    英国向美提出抗议\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】据路透社伦敦二十日电：英国猎鲸业家就麦克阿瑟擅自答应日本巨大猎鲸船队出动北极事提出严重抗议，工业界某领袖称：“如果日本猎鲸队出动，将意味着成千吨鲸油的转运日本。鲸油在欧洲的食物中极为重要，对于英国在其脂肪与人造乳酪的配给中尤为重要”。此一抗议系由农业与渔业部提交外交部，预料将向华盛顿提出照会。合众社在报导同一事件时称：麦克阿瑟的允许日捕鲸队出动，不仅引起英国反对，也将遭到挪威及其他捕鲸国家的反对。又称：上次盟国对日委员会上英代表波尔曾称允许日本捕鱼事，事前为什么不与委员会磋商？他根本不了解并指出委员会上仅讨论过在某些海面上允许日本扩大其捕鱼活动，但未讨论允许日本在其本土数千英里外作捕鲸远征。"

    "content": "Train No. 302 Returns\n　　Zhangjiakou Communication\n\n　　On the morning of the 13th, Train No. 302 on the Ping-Sui Railway, which was destroyed by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes near Yanggao Station, arrived safely at Zhangjiakou Main Station at 5:00 AM on the 15th after being repaired overnight by the station and the railway employees on the train. Nearly a hundred representatives from the General Trade Union of the Jin-Cha-Ji Railway, the Zhangjiakou Branch of the Ping-Sui Railway, standing committee members, and workers' self-defense team members from various repair factories gathered on the platform to welcome them. When the train entered the platform, the representatives swarmed forward. The first to jump off the train engine and greet everyone was the driver, Li Fengchao, who was injured by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. With a tight bandage, he shook hands and embraced everyone, overwhelmed. Many workers were speechless with emotion upon seeing their brave comrades return. Next to get off was the train conductor, Lin Xiu, and other workers. Although Conductor Lin had been up all night leading the employees in repairing the train cars, he showed no signs of fatigue. After thanking everyone, he quickly directed the employees to carefully carry the seriously injured passengers and workers onto ambulances headed for the hospital. All the workers of Train No. 302 were welcomed into the waiting room hall, where the tables were piled high with cakes, fruits, cigarettes, and other gifts from the workers. A solemn welcoming ceremony and a rally to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's fascist massacre of peaceful people began. After Train Conductor Lin Xiu reported on the eight consecutive attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's planes on Train No. 302 in a single day and the repair efforts, he resolutely swore on behalf of all the train's employees: \"Neither American planes nor dumdum bullets can scare us; on the contrary, they only strengthen our hatred for the reactionaries and our determination to fight. In addition to denouncing Chiang Kai-shek to the world, especially to the American people, for using American-aided killing weapons to massacre innocent civilians, we are determined to maintain the smooth and unimpeded railway transportation in the liberated areas day and night to answer the reactionaries' sabotage.\" The injured driver, Li Fengchao, said: \"The first time I was strafed by planes was during the 'July 7th' Incident that year. Those were Japanese planes, and I didn't say a word. But this time, I was strafed by American planes flown by Chinese people, which is the most hateful thing. This time, when the people on the train ran into the sorghum fields, Chiang Kai-shek's American-made planes chased after them and strafed the sorghum fields. When the people ran into the woods, they strafed the woods again. What law did the people break? The most tragic thing was a 19-year-old woman in the fifth district of Yanggao, who died on the train and was burned to ashes along with the train car before she could be carried off. The machine gun bullets were all thick, American-made things (the collected shell casings were all marked as American-made dumdum bullets). We workers cannot remain silent and acquiesce to the reactionaries' heinous crimes!\" All the workers were extremely indignant and vowed to intensify their work to defend the border area and smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 三零二列车回来了  张家口通讯\n\n1946-08-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　三零二列车回来了\n    张家口通讯\n    十三日晨，在阳高车站附近被美制蒋机击毁的平绥路第三零二列车，经该站及随车铁路员工连夜修理后，已于十五日黎明五时安抵张家口总站。晋察冀铁路总工会，平绥路张市分会各常委及各修理厂职工工人自卫队代表等百余人，已齐集月台迎候。当列车进入月台时，各代表即蜂涌而上。首先从列车机头上跳下来与大家相见的是被蒋机射伤的司机李凤潮，他缚紧绷带应接不暇的和大家握手拥抱，许多工人看见了回来的自己的勇敢伙伴，感动的说不出话来。接着下车的是列车长林修和其他工人们。林车长虽然彻夜未眠领导员工们修理车辆，但没有一点疲劳的神色。他向大家致谢后，即迅速指挥职工们将重伤的旅客、工人一一抬上救护车驶去医院。三零二次列车的全体工人都被欢迎到候车室大厅，桌上堆满工人们送来的蛋糕、水果、香烟等礼物。一场庄严的欢迎会，和控诉蒋介石法西斯屠杀和平人民的大会开始了。列车长林修报告了三零二次列车一日间连续遭到蒋机八次袭击及抢修的经过后，即代表该车全体员工坚决宣誓称：“随便美式飞机或者达姆弹都吓不倒我们，反更增强了我们对反动派的仇恨和斗争决心。我们除向全世界特别向美国人民控诉蒋介石拿上美国援助的杀人武器屠杀无辜老百姓外，我们决以日夜保持解放区铁路运输的顺利畅通，来回答反动派们的破坏。”受伤的司机李凤潮说：“我第一次受到飞机射扫是‘七七’事变那一年，那是日本飞机，我一句话也没有说。这回我却被中国人驾的美国飞机扫射了，这就最可恨不过了。这一次老百姓从车上跑到高粱地，蒋介石的美造飞机就追逐着扫射高粱地，老百姓跑到树林，他们又扫射到树林，究竟老百姓犯了什么法呢？最惨的是阳高五区一位十九岁的妇女，死在车上未及抬下来就跟车厢一块烧成灰了。机枪子弹都是指头粗的美国货（按拾到的弹壳均有记号系美制达姆弹）。我们工人们对反动派这种滔天罪行决不能沉默和甘休！”全体工友情绪极均激愤，誓为保卫边区粉碎蒋介石进攻而加紧工作。"

More than ten mass rallies have been held in a month, with hundreds of thousands of participants. Not only Chinese but also Malays and Indians participated. Patriotic overseas Chinese also innovatively created an anti-civil war patriotic propaganda week. Trade unions under the General Federation of Trade Unions, district groups of the New Democratic Youth League, and organized shop assistants formed dozens of propaganda teams to explain the domestic political situation to all overseas Chinese (including women and children) in all overseas Chinese residential areas, calling on compatriots to take timely action to oppose the conspiracies of domestic reactionaries to undermine peace and democracy. At the \"Ninth Prince\" Temple, an old man, after the propaganda team finished speaking, climbed onto the stage and spoke a dozen \"resolute oppositions\" in one breath against civil war and dictatorship. His sincere emotions brought tears to the eyes of the audience. During propaganda at the Tongan machine shop, a young man was greatly moved and also went on stage to denounce the Kuomintang reactionaries' treacherous acts and the accomplices of American imperialism. Instantly, applause thundered, and the cry of \"Oppose Civil War, Oppose Dictatorship\" resounded through the streets. Overseas Chinese in various regions sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek's government by express mail, demanding that US troops immediately leave China, unconditionally stop the civil war, end the one-party dictatorship, establish a coalition government, punish corrupt officials, treat overseas Chinese dependents well, and provide relief to refugees. The Singapore New Democracy newspaper said: \"The fiercer the civil war in China becomes, the higher the calls for peace at home and abroad become... This shows that the civil war in China has not received the support of the people.\" It continued: \"The post-war movement of overseas Chinese to save their hometowns must focus on opposing civil war and dictatorship.\"\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 24th: Singapore dispatch: The Singapore Seamen's General Union, the New Democratic Youth League General Branch, the Women's Federation, the Singapore Office of the China Democratic League, the Malayan Ethnic and Trade Unions, and more than 50 other organizations held a grand anti-civil war rally on the anniversary of the \"July 7th Incident,\" and passed a resolution on the spot to send telegrams to Chinese political party leaders, compatriots across the country, and US President Truman, calling for a halt to the civil war. The telegram to the leaders of various political parties and compatriots across the country stated: \"Ten months have passed since the end of the War of Resistance, but peace has not been restored, and there are cries of suffering everywhere. Domestic reactionaries still want to rely on foreign aid to engage in fratricidal strife, and the country is in deep trouble and the people are living in misery. The Singapore Overseas Chinese Anti-Civil War Conference has resolved to make an urgent appeal on behalf of overseas compatriots, demanding that domestic parties abandon their grievances, permanently stop the civil war, implement peaceful nation-building, reopen the Political Consultative Conference, establish a democratic government, restore democratic freedoms, prohibit espionage activities, and order foreign troops to withdraw unconditionally to protect sovereignty and maintain the national lifeline.\" The telegram to Truman stated: \"Japanese fascism has surrendered, but American troops are still stationed in China for a long time, and armed training of the Kuomintang army is the main reason for fueling the Chinese civil war. Overseas Chinese are indignant at this action by the United States and should respect China's independence and sovereignty, quickly withdraw troops stationed in China, stop the concession law, and cancel the ten-year military aid to China bill.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 星岛华侨纷纷集会  反内战！反独裁！  指斥国民党反动派卖国行为  要求美军立即离华停止援蒋\n\n1946-08-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　星岛华侨纷纷集会\n    反内战！反独裁！\n    指斥国民党反动派卖国行为\n    要求美军立即离华停止援蒋\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】新加坡讯：华侨反内战反独裁的群众大会遍及新加坡每个角落，一月之间举行的群众大会达十余次，参加人数达数十万。不仅有中国人，也有马来人与印度人参加。爱国华侨并创举了反内战爱国宣传周，总工会属下的各业工会，新民主青年团的各区分团及有组织的店员，成立了数十队宣传队，到一切华侨住区向所有华侨（包括妇女儿童）解释国内政局，号召侨胞及时行动起来，反对国内反动派破坏和平民主的阴谋。在“九王爷”庙，一个老头子在宣传队讲话完后爬上台去对内战和独裁一口气讲了十几个“坚决反对”，他的诚挚的感情使到会群众都落了泪。在台门机的宣传时，有一青年大受感动，亦上台指斥国民党反动派的卖国行为与美帝国主义的帮凶，一时掌声雷动，“反对内战反对独裁”的声浪响彻街衢。各地区华侨纷以快邮代电投寄蒋介石政府，要求美军立即离华，无条件停止内战，结束一党专政成立联合政府，惩办贪官污吏，善待侨眷，救济难民。新加坡新民主报称：“中国的内战打得越厉害，跟着海内外的和平呼声也就更高起来……这说明中国的内战并没有得到人民的拥护。”继称：“侨胞战后的救乡运动必须以反内战反独裁为中心任务”。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】新加坡讯：新埠海员联合总会、新民主青年团总团、妇女联合总会、中国民主同盟星岛办事处、马来亚各民族各业工会等五十余团体，曾于“七七”纪念日举行盛大的反内战大会，当场通过致电中国各政党领袖全国同胞及美总统杜鲁门，呼吁停止内战。在致各政党领袖及全国同胞电文中称：“抗战结束已历十月，和平未复，哀鸿遍野，国内反动派犹欲凭借外援作兄弟阋墙之争，国难深重，民不聊生；新加坡华侨各界反对内战大会决议，代表海外同胞作紧急呼吁，要求国内各党派捐弃嫌怨，永远停止内战，实行和平建国，重开政协会议，建立民主政府，恢复民主自由，禁止特务活动，并令外国军队一律撤退，以保主权而维国脉。”致杜鲁门的电称：“日本法西斯已投降，美国军队犹长驻中国，武装训练国民党军，实为助长中国内战之主因。海外华侨对美国此种行动莫不表示愤慨，应请尊重中国独立主权，迅速撤退驻华军队，停止租界法，取消十年军事援华法案”。"

    "content": "[Report from this newspaper in Handan on the 24th] A spokesperson for the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently spoke to a reporter from this newspaper about the progress and results of the 11-day Longhai counter-offensive for self-defense. He stated: \"Our military and civilians in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region have repeatedly protested against Chiang's troops' attacks on our eastern Henan Liberated Area, but to no avail. Since July, they have not only continued to penetrate every village and town in the eastern Henan Liberated Area, attempting to completely destroy our eastern Henan Liberated Area, but have also simultaneously launched a joint land and air offensive against the Liberated Area on both sides of the Longhai Railway. Our military and civilians in the Liberated Area, having reached the limit of their tolerance, were forced to rise up in self-defense. At midnight on the 10th of this month, they launched a counter-attack against the invading troops on the Longhai Line, successively liberating five county towns, including Lanfeng, Dangshan, Qixian, Tongxu, and Yucheng, as well as twelve stations, including Luowang, Neihuang, Lanfeng, Yejigang, Libaji, Liuheji, Xiaoba, Mamuji, Liudi Circle, Yangji, Dangshan, and Lizhuang, controlling 380 li of railway. The invading troops annihilated by us include the entire 181st Division (minus one battalion), one regiment of the 29th Division, one battalion of the 143rd Division, one battalion of the 81st Division, and two battalions of the 74th Division, totaling two divisions of regular troops. The security regiments attacking that were eliminated include the Lanfeng Security Regiment, the Dangshan Security Regiment, the Qixian Security Regiment, the 1st Security Regiment of the 12th Administrative Office of Henan, and the 3rd Security Regiment of Jiangsu. Also eliminated were the 2nd Battalion of the Special Service Regiment of the Aviation Commission, the Armed Officer Battalion of Chen Cheng's 18th Army, a part of the directly subordinate units of the 18th Division, the 1st Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Training Corps of the Armored Forces Corps of the Central Military and Political Department, and other puppet troops and special agent forces. Over 11,300 officers and soldiers, including regimental commanders Xu Wenqing and Song Tielin, laid down their arms, and 4,850 suffered pointless pain and sacrifice. We seized six American-made mountain guns, eighteen mortars, over 200 small cannons, eleven tanks, ninety American-made heavy machine guns, four hundred and fifty-eight light machine guns, seven thousand five hundred and eighty rifles, thirteen radio stations, twelve American-made automobiles, five hundred bicycles, one hundred telephones, and one hundred and thirty horses. Among those eliminated, the directly subordinate units of Chen Cheng's 18th Army's 18th Division were equipped with American weaponry and had just rushed from Wuhan, Hubei, to Xuzhou for combat.\" The spokesperson pointed out: \"The main reason for achieving these results is the result of the concerted efforts of the military and civilians throughout the region. The people in the Liberated Area are extremely indignant at the Chiang army's invasion and its crimes of slaughtering compatriots with American weapons. For days, as many as 100,000 people have rushed to the self-defense front to participate in the war. A large number of comfort goods are piled up like mountains in the rear, and men, women, old and young, support the front together, which has given the heroic soldiers who defend their homes, defend peace, democracy, and national independence unlimited encouragement.\" The spokesperson continued to point out: \"Although the invading troops have suffered serious blows, their attempt to attack has not stopped. They are continuing to mobilize troops and dispatch generals to launch a larger-scale offensive. The military and civilians in the entire border area have full confidence and united strength to meet and crush the Chiang army's offensive.\" The spokesperson finally warned the warmongering and reactionary authorities of the Kuomintang: \"If they insist on their traitorous civil war policy and fail to realize their errors as soon as possible, it is tantamount to digging their own graves. The evil consequences in the future will inevitably lead to the destruction of those who play with fire.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫军区发言人  谈陇海自卫反击战经过战果  蒋军进攻豫东解放区抗议无效我军民被迫自卫反击  其官兵万余已放下武器四千余人遭到无谓痛苦牺牲\n\n1946-08-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫军区发言人\n    谈陇海自卫反击战经过战果\n    蒋军进攻豫东解放区抗议无效我军民被迫自卫反击\n    其官兵万余已放下武器四千余人遭到无谓痛苦牺牲\n    【本报邯郸二十四日电】晋冀鲁豫军区发言人顷对本社记者发表陇海自卫反击战十一日来之战斗经过及其战果称：我晋冀鲁豫边区军民，对蒋军向我豫东解放区之进攻，曾经迭次提出抗议，都毫无效果。自七月以来，不仅继续深入豫东解放区的每一村镇，企图达到完全摧毁我豫东解放区之目的，并且同时以陆空联合的大军，向我陇海路两侧解放区进犯。我解放区军民忍无可忍，乃被迫起而自卫，于本月十日午夜，对陇海线上之进犯军，予以反击，先后解放了兰封、砀山、杞县、通许、虞城等五座县城及罗王、内黄、兰封、野鸡岗、李坝集、柳河集、小坝、马牧集、刘堤圈、杨集、砀山、李庄等十二个车站，控制铁路三百八十里，进犯军被我歼灭者计有一百八十一师全部（缺一个营）、二十九师一个团、一百四十三师一个营、八十一师一个营、七十四师两个营，共计正规军两师之众，消灭进攻之保安团队计有兰封保安团、砀山保安团、杞县保安团、河南第十二专署保安一团、江苏保安第三团等五个团。此处尚有航空委员会特务团第二营，陈诚第十八军之武装军官营，十八师之直属队一部，中央军政部装甲兵团教导总队第二团第一连，及其他伪军特务武装等亦被我歼灭。团长许文庆、宋铁林以下官兵一万一千三百余名放下武器，四千八百五十余名遭到无谓的痛苦和牺牲，缴获美式山炮六门、迫击炮十八门、小炮二百余门、坦克十一辆、美式重机枪九十挺、轻机枪四百五十八挺、步枪七千五百八十支、电台十三部、美造汽车十二辆、自行车五百辆、电话机一百部、马一百三十匹，其中被消灭之陈诚第十八军十八师直属队为美械装备，系新从湖北武汉兼程开赴徐州作战者。发言人指出：这些成绩获得的主要原因，实由于全区军民合作一致努力的结果。解放区人民对于蒋军之进犯及其在美国武器支援下屠杀同胞的罪行异常愤慨，连日奔赴自卫前线参战者计达十万之众，后方大批的慰劳品堆积如山，男女老小一起支援前线，更给了为保卫家乡保卫和平民主与民族独立的英勇战士以无限的鼓励。发言人继即指出：进犯军虽遭受了严重的打击，但其进攻企图尚未停止，正在继续调兵遣将作更大规模之进攻，全边区军民是有充分信心和团结的力量迎击和粉碎蒋军的进攻的。发言人最后警告国民党好战成性的反动当局称：如果他们要坚持其卖国内战政策不及早觉悟，无异自掘坟墓，未来的恶果必然使玩火者自遭毁灭。"

Three regiments of Chiang's troops are currently assembled inside Quwo city on the east side of Houma. On the 21st, in coordination with more than 1,300 men from the Yan Army Security Regiment in the county, they invaded Sucun and other areas of Yicheng, immediately encountering a strong counterattack from our troops, and they fled back to the city in a panic. They launched another attack on the 22nd, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the aforementioned areas.\n\n[Our newspaper, Handan, 21st dispatch] Hu Zongnan's troops in southern Shanxi, with a force of three armies, totaling five divisions and ten regiments, under the cover of airplanes and tanks, moved north along the Tongpu Road in Wenxi in four columns on the 18th, and have occupied Houma and other places, attacking the Tongpu line and the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area under the control of the Eighth Route Army. Hu Zongnan flew to Yuncheng on the 17th under the order of Chiang Kai-shek to personally command the operation. A Xinhua News Agency reporter pointed out: After Chiang Kai-shek's attack on southern Shanxi failed last month, he redeployed his forces and launched a second attack on us, echoing the Chiang troops' attacks on the Suwan-Jinpuhuai area, attempting to further organize the Chiang-Yan allied forces to seize the Tongpu Railway under the control of the Eighth Route Army, and move north along Houma-Linfen, coordinating with the troops of the 11th War Zone of the Kuomintang advancing westward along the Zhengtai Railway to encircle and attack our liberated areas, and finally converge in Taiyuan, cutting off our liberated areas in Shanxi, as a springboard for Chiang's troops to attack the North China liberated areas, and becoming a fortress for Chiang Kai-shek to directly command the civil war in Shanxi. The reporter continued: This conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek's internal war clique is not going smoothly. During the last attack on southern Shanxi, the Chiang-Yan allied forces dispatched a total of seven divisions, but under the heroic self-defense and counterattack of the army and people in the liberated areas, five regiments of Chiang's direct line troops were completely annihilated by us, resulting in the Chiang army's occupation of the area for less than a month before most of it was recovered by us. The southern section of Tongpu is still in our hands, and Chiang's attempt to open the Tongpu Road was completely shattered by us. In the self-defense counterattack battles in Tongpu and Zhengtai in the first and middle of this month, Hongdong and Zhaocheng, important towns in Tongpu, were recovered by us again, and more than a hundred miles of railway line between Hongdong and Zhaocheng was controlled by us. The Zhengtai Road was also cut into several sections by the local Eighth Route Army, and the Chiang-Yan allied forces were cut off from north to south, without contact with each other. Therefore, the reporter finally pointed out: This new offensive by the Chiang-Yan allied forces will inevitably encounter serious difficulties and meet with a more powerful blow from the army and people in the liberated areas!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋南蒋阎军进犯  激战在翼城苏村等地进行中\n\n1946-08-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋南蒋阎军进犯\n    激战在翼城苏村等地进行中\n    【同蒲前线二十四日电】蒋军三十八集团军总司令董钊，已于十六日由运城抵达闻喜，直接指挥沿同蒲线侯马等地继续北犯之蒋军。侯马东侧曲沃城内现集结蒋军三个团，二十一日配合该县阎军保安团共一千三百余人侵我翼城苏村等地，当即遭我军有力反击，狼狈窜回城内。二十二日再度出犯，现激战正在上述地区进行中。\n    【本报邯郸二十一日电】晋南胡宗南军，十八日以三个军共五个师十个团的兵力，在飞机坦克掩护下，沿闻喜同蒲路四路北上，已占我侯马等地，进攻八路军控制下的同蒲沿线及晋南解放区。胡宗南奉蒋介石命令于十七日飞赴运城亲自指挥。新华社记者指出：蒋介石上月进攻晋南失败后，重新部署兵力，向我进行的第二次进攻已经开始了，将与苏皖津浦陇海蒋军进攻遥相呼应，企图进一步组织蒋阎联军夺取八路军控制下的同蒲线，并沿侯马临汾北上，与沿正太路西进之国民党十一战区部队夹击我解放区，最后会师太原，割裂我山西各解放区，作为蒋军进攻华北解放区的一道跳板，成为蒋介石直接指挥山西内战的堡垒。该记者继称：蒋介石内战集团此一阴谋并不是得心应手的。上次进攻晋南时，蒋阎联军共出动了七个师的兵力，但在解放区军民的英勇自卫反击下，蒋军嫡系部队五个团，即全部被我歼灭，致蒋军侵占地区不及一月，即大部为我收复。同蒲南段仍在我军手中，蒋军打通同蒲路企图乃彻底被我粉碎。本月上中旬在同蒲正太自卫反击战中，同蒲重镇之洪洞、赵城又为我收复，洪赵间百余里铁道线为我控制，正太路亦为当地八路军切为数段，蒋阎联军已南北隔断互不联系。因此该记者最后指出：此次蒋阎联军的新进攻必将遭受严重的困难，遇到解放区军民更有力的打击！"

    "content": "Henan People on the Brink of Death\n    -- A True Record of Chiang Kai-shek's Tyranny\n    Xiao Qin\n\n\"The four disasters of Henan: floods, droughts, locusts, and Tang Enbo [a Nationalist general notorious for his harsh conscription policies].\" Especially in the summer of 1938 when Xuzhou fell, the Nationalist authorities disregarded the life and death of the people and breached the Yellow River. A full eight counties, two million people suffered from the flood disaster. In the years after the flood, they encountered two more severe droughts, coupled with exorbitant taxes, miscellaneous levies, conscription, corvée labor, extortion, and apportionment. Some families even committed suicide, some exchanged their sons for grain, and even tree bark, grass roots, mud, and bird droppings were used as food. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, except for the areas liberated by the Communist Eighth Route Army, the disasters faced by the people of Henan increased day by day.\n\nLast August, after the enemy announced their surrender, people breathed a sigh of relief, their eyes radiating with comfort; everyone rejoiced at the victory of the motherland and prayed for a stable life after the war.\n\nBut what did victory bring to the people of Henan? It brought the gathering of large armies, the on-the-spot requisition of military grain, and the fact that those who had fled could not make a living upon their return, and had to live like primitive people on a piece of barren land. Still others engaged in robbery, extortion, rape, and humiliation. Under the oppression of heavy burdens, people left their homes. Even the China Times published in Kaifeng said: \"After the victory, millions of troops could not be demobilized immediately, and their military discipline was not up to par. The requisition of military grain was as urgent as a shooting star, with endless darkness due to embezzlement. The harvest of the farmers was completely collected, and the blood of the farmers was drained, yet it was still not enough to supply them. In the past, people's lives depended on the land, but now the land taxes are forcing people away.\" This is a very good portrayal.\n\n     ×                    ×                ×\n\n\"The donations are too high, people can't live, young people have all run away to other places, we old people are just waiting to die.\" This is the indignant remark of an old gentleman from Jixian County, but it is also the lament of the entire county. According to the materials of the county's grain section alone: public grain from October last year to March this year totaled 1.5 million jin, and military grain was countless. From August to December last year, it totaled 4 million jin. This year, the 30th Army borrowed 560,000 jin of military grain, the Three Route Columns borrowed 200,000 jin of grain, and 540,000 jin of grain were stockpiled for military use, totaling 7 million jin. In addition to these, which were requisitioned by the Nationalist County Government, there were many that the army directly demanded from the Baojia [local administrative units]. This number was even greater than the former. From the victory last year to May this year, the total amount of grain produced by the people in the Nationalist-controlled area of Jixian County was more than 15 million jin. With a population of 100,000, regardless of men, women, old or young, rich or poor, on average, each person had to bear 150 jin of grain. That's not all. In addition to grain, 1.8 million jin of firewood had to be sent every day, and recently 160 blockhouses had to be repaired, each costing 30,000 yuan, which adds up to an expenditure of 4.8 million yuan. Plus the \"office personnel\" profiting from it, the people's blood and sweat were squeezed dry.\n\nIf Jixian County was like this, other places were the same. Xiuwu County was a severely affected area. Not counting other burdens, the clothes and socks forcibly demanded by the garrison alone were worth 12.9 million yuan. The entire county has 38 Bao, and one Bao had to pay 1 million yuan. Shi Hengtian of Hongmiao Jincun Village in Huixian County had 120 mu of land. In normal years, he could only harvest 80 shi in two seasons, but from November last year to March this year, he paid 84 shi of grain.\n\nThe situation in the cities is also difficult to be optimistic about: In Anyang City, a small cigarette shop with a capital of only 100,000 yuan paid 5,000 yuan in Xiaofu Yang [a local currency], 10,000 yuan in Bao fees, and 5,000 yuan in cigarette monopoly fees from January to June. Each Ding Yang [another local currency] cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. In addition, the extortion of lower-level personnel, as well as the quite considerable amount of taxes and fees for house numbers, household registration, electricity, ash, and coal. What threatens businessmen the most is the state capitalist monopoly of the market, manipulation of materials, and runaway inflation, which makes all businesses, large and small, precarious and unsustainable. According to a survey: In the past six months, more than 200 flower cloth and sundry goods stores have closed, accounting for 20%; more than 200 have reduced their business and merged stores, and the number of seated merchants changing to itinerant merchants, and itinerant merchants changing to peddlers is even greater.\n\n              ×                      ×                    ×\n\nHearing that relief supplies were to be distributed, everyone waited anxiously, like expecting clouds in a severe drought. But things often turned out contrary to people's expectations. When the relief supplies were distributed, those who were truly without food and clothing still wore sad faces and did not get anything. Who did the supplies relieve? On May 4th, the Third Relief Group of the Anyang General Branch of the Henan Branch answered this question: According to the investigation, after the refugees in Lin County received flour, County Chief Cheng Wanbao sent people to take back half a bag from each household, saying it was to offset the military grain for the local militia. When the county official Zhang Wei registered refugees, he extorted registration fees of hundreds or thousands of yuan from each person, and some paid several thousand. With more money, they could fabricate household registration or inflate the population. That's not all. When Cheng Wanbao distributed flour, he temporarily hired many people to impersonate refugees, and steadily put the relief supplies into his own pockets. In the 123 households of refugees in Lin County, a reporter made a statistic: 20% were civil servants, 40% were fabricated households, and 30% were wealthy merchants. What is even more bizarre is that some county governments actually disguised their militia soldiers as refugees and drove dozens of large carts to receive relief flour in a grand manner. An adjutant of a certain special commissioner's office was also registered in the refugee list, and the county party secretary's old father and the county chief's younger brother were also listed in the refugee team to receive relief grain, so the common people said that the Nationalist Party's so-called relief was actually \"relieving themselves.\" The refugees can only quench their thirst with plums.\n\n              ×                      ×                    ×\n\nA folk rhyme called \"The County Chief's World\" can quite reflect the general licentiousness and shamelessness of the bureaucratic group and the so-called \"officialdom.\" It is now recorded below:\n\n    Before taking office, poor heaven and earth.\n    Upon taking office, happy heaven and earth.\n    After taking office, flowers, wine, and land.\n    Bragging, talking about heaven and earth.\n    Handling affairs, deceiving heaven and earth.\n    Losing temper, cursing heaven and earth.\n    Demanding bribes, concealing heaven and earth.\n    Treating the people, fierce heaven and earth.\n    Arousing public anger, crying heaven and earth.\n    Asking you to leave, thanking heaven and earth.\n\nFrom the inquiries of the Henan Provincial Council in April and May, we can also see what those gentlemen who call themselves \"parents of the people\" are doing, and how the upper and lower levels are colluding and protecting each other. At the meeting on April 30, Councilor Guo Haichang said: \"Many county chiefs have been dismissed for corruption with evidence, or escorted to the province because of accusations, but once they are escorted to the province, they disappear. For example, the former County Chief Zhang of Huojia County and the secretary of the Fourth District Commissioner's Office were both escorted here, but where are they now?...\" Councilor Shen Huanan said: \"The former County Chief of Guangshan County was derelict in his duties during the occupation and was dismissed for investigation, but I don't know if it was really investigated. Now he has been appointed as the County Chief of Shangqiu, and it is a large county.\" Councilor Zhang ×× said: \"The handover of county chiefs is not clear, and the former affects the latter. How can this be tolerated! The former County Chief Pang of Xiasheng County left his post without authorization and withdrew hundreds of thousands of yuan from the field grain office. Now his whereabouts are unknown, and no one is asking about it.\" Due to unclear officialdom and mutual connivance and protection, drugs are also rampant. Councilor Miao proposed: \"Township chiefs smoke opium, the section chiefs of the county government smoke opium, and even the anti-smoking commissioners sent by the provincial government smoke opium. Where did these drugs come from? Are they smuggled by merchants? Are township chiefs protecting them? Are the public security bureau chiefs protecting them? The national army is better?\" Bai Zongde continued: \"Drugs are rampant throughout the province. They come from the hands of Koreans in Kaifeng. Most Koreans are related to important people in the provincial capital.\" Another councilor proposed the buying and selling of township chief positions in various counties. It is said that poor townships cost 200,000 yuan, and wealthy townships cost more than 2 million yuan. These speeches are naturally not enough to expose even one-thousandth of the Nationalist Party's officialdom. But it can help us understand why, after the victory, the people in the Nationalist-controlled areas still live in unbelievably painful times.\n\n              ×                      ×                  ×\n\nSomeone with the pen name Bitter Water wrote a poem entitled \"On the Line of Hunger,\" mainly describing the tragic situation of the people of Henan under the rule of the Nationalist Party after the victory.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to the Shanghai Wen Hui Bao on the 2nd, Li Jinsheng of Aiteng Village, Hanlu Township, Anyang County, harvested 70 *shi* of wheat this year but was assessed 90 *shi*. After paying the full amount, his family had no food left, and he died crying. Zhang Jinran of the same village handed over six *dou* of wheat, but had only harvested three; paying it all left him only half of what he needed. He hanged himself. Ji Shengqing Zhang Muqiao, a member of the fourth household of the fifth *jia*, handed over all the wheat she harvested but it wasn't enough, so she threw herself into a well and died. The *baozhang*, Chang Shun, also committed suicide by jumping into a well because he was forced to collect grain. This \"grain requisition\" was only the \"regimental grain\" of Wang Zizai's puppet army, which had been reorganized by the Kuomintang; it was not even the formal \"grain levy\" or \"grain borrowing\" of the Kuomintang government.\n\nOf the 120 counties in Henan, over 90 have been affected by yellow locusts, wind, hail, drought, locust plagues, and harassment by stationed troops. The province's wheat harvest this year is less than 30% of normal, but there are 780,000 stationed troops (not including reorganized puppet troops and local militias). The Kuomintang government only provides food for 380,000 people, leaving the rest to \"fend for themselves.\" As a result, the entire province is subsidizing military rations and \"non-staple food expenses\" amounting to 760,000,000 yuan per month. According to official statistics, 7,800,000,000 yuan has been paid in subsidies in the ten months since \"liberation.\" This does not include local extortion and assessments. As for the Yellow River works and dike-building projects, there were original budget estimates, but the commissioners are even assessing the local population for willow branches, materials, and wooden stakes. It is estimated that the \"purchasing\" of materials and wooden stakes in the first and fourth districts alone is worth 500,000,000 yuan; the first, second, fourth, fifth, tenth, and twelfth districts each sent 20,000 laborers, with a monthly \"advance\" of 180,000,000 yuan for labor costs. After four months of construction, this amounts to over 7,000,000,000 yuan. The above military rations and Yellow River works have already squeezed over 15,000,000,000 yuan from the people. On July 13, the people of various counties organized \"disaster appeal groups\" and went to the provincial capital to petition, demanding a reduction in this year's \"actual levy\" and \"borrowing levy.\" The representatives said, \"The amount is so huge that it wouldn't be enough even if the people gave all their grain to the government.\" However, the Kuomintang authorities ignored the appeals of the petition groups.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沪文汇报报导：蒋军横征成大灾  河南人民上吊投井\n\n1946-08-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沪文汇报报导：\n    蒋军横征成大灾\n    河南人民上吊投井\n    【新华社延安十九日电】据二日沪文汇报载称：安阳县韩陆乡艾停村李金声本年收麦七十石，应摊派九十石，全数缴纳，家中断炊，大哭而死。同村张金然因出麦子六斗，但仅收了三斗，全数缴出只够半数，自缢而死。济生卿张慕桥五甲四户张李氏收麦全数缴出不够，投井自尽。保长常顺因被迫派粮，亦投井自杀。这些“派粮”仅仅是被国民党改编的伪军王自全部的“团粮”，还不是国民党政府的正式的“征粮”“征借”。\n    河南一百二十县中受黄苍、风雹、旱灾、蝗灾，及被驻军骚扰的灾区共达九十余县，全省今年麦收不足三成，而驻军（改编伪军，及地方团队不计在内）达七十八万，国民党政府只发三十八万人的粮食，其余均听其“自由谋食”。因此全省赔垫军粮及“副食费”等每月达七十六万万元。以上据官方有统计的数字，“光复”后至今十个月已赔垫七八百万万元。地方的勒索摊派还不在内。至于黄工、堵口工程，原有工程费预算，但委员老爷却连柳枝，材料，木桩都向地方摊派，估计一、四两区“代购”材料木桩约值五十万万元；一、二、四、五、十、十二等六个区各派民夫两万人，每月“垫支”工费一百八十万万元。开工到现在以四个月计即须七百余万万元。上面军粮黄工两项即已榨取了人民一千五百万万元以上。七月十三日，各县人民纷纷组织“灾情哭诉团”赴省请愿，要求将本年度的“征实”“征借”数量予以减少。代表们说：“此数之巨，叫老百姓把粮食全部给了政府还是不够。”然而，国民党当局对哭诉团的呼吁置诸不问。"

    "content": "Hot Tears\n    Jin Sha\n    The weeds in the courtyard were taller than Old Lady Zhang's neck. She painstakingly pushed them aside with her hands as she walked, and sometimes the weeds brushed her eyes, but her tear-dried eyes were like a dry well, without a trace of tears. She pushed open the tightly closed door, and a gloomy, pungent odor rushed out. The tables and chairs inside were overturned, missing legs and feet, and covered with a thick layer of dust, at least three inches thick, imprinted with several large handprints. This was the place where Zhang Conglong's subordinates' bloody hands had touched. These bloody hands killed the old men Li Caixin and Li Baotao in our village... drove away the people and livestock in our village... Old Lady Zhang trembled with anger and began to curse Zhang Conglong as she sat on the threshold.\n    A burst of hurried footsteps outside startled Old Lady Zhang. Of course, it wasn't Zhang Conglong's troops from three days ago. Hmph! Zhang Conglong's troops could never come again. Old Lady Zhang knew that these were our troops. She quickly brought out a pile of peaches from her house and gave each of our soldiers one. The first soldier couldn't refuse and accepted it, and Old Lady Zhang couldn't close her mouth. But the second, third, and fourth soldiers smiled, shook their heads, and slipped past her. Old Lady Zhang became anxious, thinking: \"Peaches are fuzzy, and our people are hygienic...\" Old Lady Zhang hurried back to her house and went to her neighbor's house to wash them with water, but they still shook their heads and slipped past her. Old Lady Zhang became anxious and stammered, \"You... you...\"\n    The troops didn't seem to notice. On the contrary, the word was passed from front to back, \"Keep up,\" \"Keep up,\" as if deliberately trying to make things difficult for Old Lady Zhang. Old Lady Zhang became really anxious. She jumped up and rushed into the ranks of the troops, shouting.\n    \"You must eat my peaches, you must eat my peaches...\" She shouted frantically, but the troops continued to slip past her one after another. Old Lady Zhang couldn't stop them. She suddenly thought that our people were probably going to chase after Zhang Conglong! She thought: Drown Zhang Conglong in the Fen River, let him die stiff and straight! It would be even better to capture him alive and stab him to death inch by inch! Old Lady Zhang busied herself, frantically stuffing the peaches into the soldiers' hands. Suddenly, a rider passed by, and Old Lady Zhang had an idea. She grabbed the horse's reins and asked, \"Why don't you let our people eat my peaches? This is my heart's desire...\"\n    The rider dismounted. He discovered two bright, crystal-clear teardrops in Old Lady Zhang's eyes, shining brightly. The teardrops fell from her old, wrinkled eyes onto the back of his hand, warm. Where could one buy this warmth with money? The rider felt as if he were in front of his own loving mother and was too moved to speak.\n    \"We must, we must eat them.\"\n    The rider tightly grasped the old lady's hand, his own eyes also feeling warm. \"Old Lady, our troops are rushing down to fight the enemy. We'll eat them when we come back!\"\n    Old Lady Zhang shook her head, stuffed two peaches into the rider's hand, turned and walked away, muttering to herself on the other side, \"Eat them when you come back, there will be better ones...\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 热泪\n金沙\n1946-08-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　热泪\n    金沙\n    院子里的蒿子没过张老太太的脖子。她吃力地用手拔开走过去，有时蒿子稍碰着眼睛，但淌干了泪水的眼睛好像一口枯井，已经没有半点泪花了。她把紧闭的门推开，房里阴森森的，直冲出一股刺鼻的臭味，桌子椅子断腿少脚的东倒西歪，上面的尘土足足有三寸厚，印着几个粗大的手印。这是张从龙部下血手摸过的地方，这血手杀了咱村老汉李才新、李保桃……赶走咱村里的人、牲口……。张老太太气得发抖，坐在门坎上骂起张从龙来。\n    门外一阵紧促的脚步声，熟悉的把张老太太惊动起来，当然这不是前三天张从龙的部队，哼！张从龙的部队永远不能再来了。张老太太知道这是咱们的部队，她赶忙从家中捧出一堆桃儿，给咱们的战士们一人一颗。第一个战士情不可却的接过去，张老太太的嘴合不拢来。可是第二个、第三个、第四个都笑了笑，摇摇头，从她身边溜过去，张老太太着急起来。心想：桃儿有毛，咱的人讲卫生……，张老太太急促促的走回去，走到邻家找水洗过后，可是他们还是摇摇头，从身旁溜过去。张老太太着急了，呐呐的说“你们……你们……”\n    队伍好像没有发觉，相反的前面往后传：“跟上”“跟上”，好像故意和张老太太为难，张老太太真急了，她跳起来往队伍里冲过去，叫着。\n    “你要吃我的桃儿，你要吃我的桃儿……”她发疯似的叫着，但是队伍还是一个跟一个的溜过去，张老太太是拦不住的。她忽然想到，咱们的人大概是去追赶张从龙吧！她想：把张从龙淹死在汾河里，死的直挺挺的吧，要是活捉住更好，一针一针的刺死有多好啊！张老太太忙碌起来，手忙脚乱的把桃儿塞在战士们的手里，忽然有个骑马的过去，张老太太计上心来，一把拉住马缰，问道：“你们怎么不叫咱们的人吃我的桃儿？这是我的心意呀……”\n    骑马的人跳下马来，他从张老太太的眼里发现两颗亮晶晶的泪花，闪闪的发着光彩，泪花从枯老的眼眶上掉下来，掉在自己手背上，热热的这里有着无限的温暖，谁能用钱买到这温暖呢？骑马的像在自己的慈母面前，激动的说不出话来。\n    “不能，一定要吃”。\n    骑马的紧紧的握着老太太的手，自己的眼里也热热的：“老太太咱队伍赶下去打敌人，回来时再吃吧”！\n    张老太太摇摇头，拿出两颗桃儿往骑马的手里一塞，转身走开，又在另一边自言自语说：“回来再吃，还有好的……”"

Yao Yilin, Director of the Industry and Commerce Department, and others have requested a reduction or exemption from grain and winter clothing supplies, and have formulated personal production and savings plans. Li Zhengnan, Director of the Zhang City Finance Bureau, in addition to mobilizing his entire family to economize and donate 100,000 yuan, has also requested that his entire monthly salary be waived until Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is crushed. Recently, Fang Cai, an old cook of the CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau, donated all of his accumulated savings of over 4,000 yuan and towels, soap, etc., earnestly instructing the administrative authorities to forward them to the front lines. Mr. Xu Zheng, an agricultural and forestry technician of the Border Region Administrative Committee, indignantly donated 100,000 yuan of his personal income. Liu Xingnong, a labor hero from an agency, donated all 120,000 yuan of his agricultural income from last year. When the blackboard newspaper at Bethune Medical University just announced \"The front needs water bottles,\" the students immediately collected and donated 200 water bottles to the front lines. During the previous announcement that \"Wounded soldiers need blood transfusions,\" 33 students immediately volunteered. International friend and medical professor, Dr.傍莱 (an Australian), also requested a monthly salary reduction of 340 catties of millet to donate to the soldiers defending the liberated areas. Li Dunbai (Sidney Rittenberg), Secretary of the China Aid Committee (an American), also donated 226 US dollars (equivalent to 500,000+ legal tender yuan) and wrote a letter of condolence in Chinese to the Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters at the front.\n    [Reported by this newspaper from Wei County] Recently, Kuomintang special agents hidden underground in Pingyuan County have continued to carry out assassinations and sabotage. Armed groups led by Xie Huawu and Wang Junsheng are looting in the first district, attempting to join the remnants of defeated bandits led by Deng Xiechen in the seventh district of Gaotang, cutting off our connection between the first and fifth districts, and further encroaching on our liberated areas. In order to thoroughly combat the activities of special agents, the county is organizing the entire county's armed forces to resolve and eliminate the organized special agents, while also transferring more than 40 county and district cadres to form armed work teams to eliminate the special agents' henchmen and destroy their lower-level organizations. The joint defense armed work team was formed on August 5th and has already begun working in the countryside. Guo Qing, a puppet bandit from Linzhang County, has also continuously sent armed special agents to sabotage, assassinate, and extort grain and money. In order to ensure the smooth development of the peasant emancipation movement, the county has decided to strengthen armed anti-espionage work, improve the leadership of the second district headquarters, divide the entire district into four joint defense zones, each with a dedicated person in charge. They are establishing intelligence networks and conducting extensive propaganda and education among the puppet personnel. The militia guerrillas of the department are closely cooperating and actively taking action.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 积极支援自卫战  张市机关纷纷献金  冀南民兵加紧肃清伪匪\n\n1946-08-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　积极支援自卫战\n    张市机关纷纷献金\n    冀南民兵加紧肃清伪匪\n    【新华社张家口二十四日电】边区及张市各机关已掀起节约献金支援自卫战争的热潮。工商处处长姚依林等请求减免粮食冬装的供给，并订出个人生产节约计划。张市财政局长李正南除动员全家节衣缩食捐献十万元外，并请求在粉碎蒋介石进攻以前免除每月全部薪金。最近数日中共晋察冀中央局老炊事员方彩，将历年生产节约的四千余元和手巾肥皂等全部献出，恳切嘱咐行政当局转给前线。边区行政委员会农林技正徐正先生，愤慨捐献个人利得十万元。机关劳动英雄刘醒农将去年农作收入十二万元全部捐出。白求恩医科大学当黑板报刚宣布“前方需要水壶”，同学们立即收集了水壶两百个捐献前线。在前一次宣布“负伤将士需要输血”时，该校立即就有三十三人报了名。国际友人医大教授傍莱大夫（澳籍）亦请求每月减薪三百四十斤小米，捐助保卫解放区的战士。美援华委员会秘书李敦白（美籍）亦捐出美金二百二十六元（合法币五十余万元），并用中文亲写慰问信一封给前方八路军指战员。\n    【本报威县讯】近来平原县暗藏地下之国民党特务分子，仍不断进行暗杀破坏。成股的武装以谢化武、王俊生为首，在一区大肆抢劫，企图结合高唐七区邓协忱等溃散之残匪，割断我一五区的联系，进一步蚕食我解放区，该县为彻底打击特务活动，一面组织全县武装解决消灭成股特务，一面抽调县区干部四十余人，组织武工队，肃清特务爪牙，摧毁其下层组织。联防武工队已于八月五日组成，并已开始下乡工作。临漳县伪匪郭清，亦不断派出武装特务，破坏、暗杀、勒索粮款。该县为保卫农民翻身运动的顺利开展，决定加强武装反特工作，健全二区指挥部的领导，将全区划为四个联防区，各设专人负责。建立情报，并对伪属广泛进行宣传教育等，该部民兵游击队，正密切配合积极行动中。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Following the publication of the Marshall statement, the movement of the American people demanding that the U.S. government correct its erroneous China policy and withdraw U.S. troops from China has expanded more widely. The Committee to Secure Peace led nine mass meetings, with over 4,000 participants, who sent letters to Truman demanding the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from China and requesting that assistance to China be halted until a democratic government is established. The Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) wrote to Truman on the 15th of this month, demanding the complete withdrawal of American troops from China. The letter condemned the U.S. government authorities for using military and financial power to encourage Chinese reactionaries to fight against the people striving for democracy and peace while Marshall was \"mediating,\" stating that this measure was contradictory. It also strongly advocated that \"the political destiny of a country should be determined by its people and parties.\" Thirty-six professors from the City University of New York sent a joint telegram to Truman on the 16th, requesting the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from China and the cessation of financial and military aid to China, pending the establishment of a democratic coalition government. Foster, Chairman of the American Communist Party, who is currently visiting San Francisco, recently reiterated the American Communist Party's policy of demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. At a press conference, Foster asserted: \"In China, our government is supporting the fascist government of Chiang Kai-shek in destroying democratic forces and is preparing a base to attack the Soviet Union with the assistance of the Chinese army.\" Foster listed the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China as one of the elements of world peace. General Carlson, Chairman of the Committee to Secure Peace, delivered a speech to veterans on the 19th, demanding the immediate recall of U.S. Marines from China. Senator Ellender, who had traveled to the Far East, stated during a broadcast that U.S. Marines could not continue to remain in China, and that if they continued to stay, it would cause great tragedy. He also said that the quicker the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, the more beneficial it would be to the United States; if the Chinese civil war continues, the United Nations should intervene. Black representative Cripps said that black people demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China and the cessation of American colonial policies. American writer Snow stated that the Chinese Communist Party was compelled to take up arms, and that it did so to prevent the corrupt and dictatorial Kuomintang government from eliminating its supporters. He said: \"We are 16,000 kilometers away from China and are using the excuses used by Japan to invade China and the Nazis in Europe to establish a unilateral alliance, which is fundamentally a denial of the autonomy and independence of the Chinese people.\" The New York Times published a letter from reader Keel on the 20th, criticizing the newspaper's incorrect statement that it seemed the Communist Party was undermining the ceasefire agreement. Keel stated: \"Marshall's mediation work is a farce; comforting people with one hand while helping the other side.\" Keel requested the recall of U.S. troops from the Chinese side, so that the Chinese people could establish a coalition government according to their own will.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: According to a New York dispatch by the Associated Press carried in the Tianjin Yishibao on August 17, thirty-six professors from New York University, Columbia University, and Queens College recently sent a telegram to President Truman, requesting the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China and expressing their shock and dismay at the assassination of Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu in Kunming. Similar requests were also sent to Acting Secretary of State Acheson and Congress, stating: \"The American academic community is shocked and dismayed by the news that Professors Li and Wen were recently assassinated in Kunming for freely expressing their opinions. Professor Wen was a famous Chinese writer and a graduate of the University of Chicago. After Li Gongpu was assassinated, Wen delivered a passionate speech at the memorial service, and unexpectedly, he was also assassinated four hours later. As university professors in New York City, in view of this serious incident and the original intention of establishing a united and democratic China, we demand that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from China and cease all financial and military aid to China until a democratic coalition government is established, and then resume it.\"\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: According to the U.S. Information Service, Washington, 21st: The recent serious situation in China has aroused greater attention from American public opinion. American radio commentator Schilling declared on the exchange radio station on the 20th that the situation in China is a problem that the United Nations should consider.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美人民谴责政府对华错误政策  要求撤退驻华美军  美共领袖福斯特重申要求美军离华  名作家史诺说中共乃被迫拿起武器\n\n1946-08-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美人民谴责政府对华错误政策\n    要求撤退驻华美军\n    美共领袖福斯特重申要求美军离华\n    名作家史诺说中共乃被迫拿起武器\n    【新华社延安廿四日电】马司声明发表后，美国人民要求美国政府改正对华错误政策撤退驻华美军的运动更广泛展开。争取和平委员会领导举行了九个群众大会，大会参加者四千余人，致函杜鲁门要求从中国撤退美国海军陆战队，并要求在中国尚未建立民主政府之前停止帮助中国。美国产业工会联合会所属政治行动委员会于本月十五日上书杜鲁门，要求美国军队全部自中国撤退。该函谴责美政府当局在马歇尔方在“调停”之同时，利用军事及财政力量鼓励中国反动分子对争取民主与和平的人民作战，此种措施实属矛盾。并力主“一国之政治命运应由其人民及政党自行决定”。纽约市大学教授三十六人十六日联名电请杜鲁门立刻撤退在华美军，停止对华金融与军事援助，以待民主联合政府成立。现正访问旧金山之美共主席福斯特顷重申美共要求美军撤离中国之方针。福斯特在招待记者席上力称：“在中国我们的政府是在支持蒋介石法西斯政府摧毁民主势力，是在中国陆军协助之下准备进攻苏联的基地。”福斯特把美军撤离中国列为世界和平要素之一。争取和平委员会主席卡尔逊将军十九日对参战军人发表演说，要求从中国立即召回美国海军陆战队。游历远东回来的参议员艾伦德广播时主张美海军陆战队不能继续留在中国，如果继续留华，将引起很大的惨剧。并称：驻华美军撤退迅速，则越有利于美国；中国内战如继续不停，联合国应加以干涉。黑人代表克利浦斯说：黑人要求美军撤出中国，停止美国的殖民地政策。美国著名作家史诺声明：中国共产党是迫不得已拿起武器的，其所以这样作，是不让国民党腐败独裁的政府消灭自己的拥护者。他说：“我们与中国相距一万六千公里，采用日本侵略中国及纳粹在欧洲所使用过的借口建立单方面的联盟，基本是否认中国人民的自主与独立。”纽约时报二十日公布读者基尔一封信，指责该报不正确的声明：似乎是共产党破坏停战协定。基氏声明说：“马歇尔的调停工作是一出滑稽戏；以一只手在安慰人，而另一只手又在帮助其中之另一方面。”基氏要求从中国方面召回美驻军，使中国人民有可能按照自己的意志建立联合政府。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】据天津益世报八月十七日载美联社纽约讯：纽约大学、哥伦比亚大学、及皇后学院等校教授三十六人，顷致电杜鲁门总统，要求撤退驻华美军，并对闻一多、李公朴在昆明被刺事件，表示不胜惊震。同时并有类似请求送致代理国务卿亚泽逊及国会称：李、闻两名教授因自由发表意见而于最近在昆明被着消息传来，美学术界人士不胜惊震，闻教授乃著名之中国文学家，且为芝加哥大学之毕业生。李公朴被刺之后，闻氏乃于追悼会上悲愤陈词，不意四小时后，亦被暗杀。吾人身为纽约城之大学教授，鉴于此种严重事件与建立联合民主中国之初衷，要求美军立即退出中国，并停止一切对华金钱与军事上之援助，直至民主之联合政府成立时，再行恢复。\n    【新华社延安二十三日电】据美新闻处华盛顿二十一日讯：最近中国之严重形势已引起美舆论更大注意，美无线电评论家希霖，二十日在交换广播电台宣称：中国之情势为联合国应予考虑之问题。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, August 24th: The No. 1 Battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Regiment of the Kuomintang Traffic Police, which staged an anti-civil war uprising at Nanquan Station, was formally reorganized into the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army. A grand establishment meeting was held on the afternoon of the 18th, attended by more than 20,000 people from all walks of life. After the chairman announced the significance of the meeting, Wang Yifan, commander of the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army, led all officers and soldiers in a swearing-in ceremony under the supervision of Wang Yiting, speaker of the Jiaodong District Council, representing the 10 million people of the entire district. The oath roughly stated: \"Our officers and soldiers, in order to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out the country and engaging in civil war, launched an uprising in Nanquan. Now, after discussion by all officers and soldiers, we are named the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army, vowing to join hands with the military and civilians of the liberated areas to struggle for the establishment of a new China. We will not hesitate to sacrifice ourselves. If there is any behavior that violates this oath, we are willing to be punished by the people.\" Then, Commander Wang Yifan gave a speech saying: \"A week ago, we and all the advanced friends present were still in a state of hostility, but now we have embarked on a common path. Since entering the liberated areas, we have received warm welcome and condolences from all walks of life, and we are truly grateful beyond words. In the future, we will only stand on the side of the people and fight to the end to express our gratitude. This is the world of the people, and only here dare I speak the truth in my heart. Chiang Kai-shek wants to control the troops with secret agents, but he will never succeed. In the past, we were trained by Dai Li, Chiang's trusted direct line, but we are unwilling to use American weapons to slaughter our own compatriots. After this blow, Chiang Kai-shek should realize something, otherwise we will use the weapons he issued to strike him!\" Wang Yiting, speaker of the Jiaodong Council, and Cao Manzhi, director of the Jiaodong Administrative Office, delivered speeches successively, paying their respects and congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Independent Detachment of the Democratic National Salvation Army. After representatives of the masses from all walks of life presented flags, the Victory Theater performed the Peking opera \"Driven to Join Liangshan\" to add to the festivities.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Laiyang, August 24th: Wang Yifan (previously mistakenly reported as Wang Yifang), the battalion commander of the No. 1 Battalion of the 15th Traffic Police Regiment of the Kuomintang Traffic Police, who led the armed anti-civil war uprising in Nanquan, recently wrote an article elaborating on the reasons for this uprising. The original article roughly stated: We are the armed forces of Chiang Kai-shek's trusted subordinates led by the secret agent leader Dai Li. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, under the instruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries' fallacy of \"saving the country through a tortuous path,\" some were ordered to surrender to the Japanese invaders and engage in \"underground work\" against the Communist Party and the people in conjunction with the Japanese invaders. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, they were reorganized into the Traffic Police of the Ministry of Transportation of the Kuomintang government, with a total of 18 regiments. Our salaries and allowances were higher than those of other Chiang's troops in some places because we were Chiang's trusted troops, such as exemption from mixing coarse grains in staple food. In addition, there were some special agents who were particularly loyal and trusted by Chiang, who secretly received private subsidies from Chiang. Our uprising in Nanquan on the Jiaoji Railway this time was beyond Chiang's expectation. I think he would think: \"That's strange, how come even my trusted troops don't listen to me?!\" The reason for this uprising is very simple: we are unwilling to risk our lives for Chiang's personal gain and do things that violate the will of the people. After eight years of bloody war, our country made the Japanese invaders surrender unconditionally, recovered the lost territories, and restored sovereignty. The compatriots across the country were celebrating the arrival of peace and were preparing to build the country together. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek harbored evil intentions and launched a nationwide civil war, driving countless young people away from their homes to serve as cannon fodder, intending to eliminate democratic forces in order to consolidate his personal throne. In order to obtain the assistance of American imperialist elements, Chiang did not hesitate to sell out national sovereignty, allowing foreign ships to freely navigate inland rivers, and turning military ports and airports into US naval and air force bases. All measures were taken to cater to the reactionary elements of the United States, disregarding the country's position as a colony. In addition, Kuomintang officials at all levels engaged in corruption and embezzled the people everywhere, such as grain fund fraud, large-scale fraud involving accepting enemy and puppet materials, relief material fraud, and large-scale fraud in the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus, seeking profit at every turn, causing a tragic situation of industrial and commercial depression and people's hardship. If this continues, the country will no longer be a country. We sincerely hope that patriotic compatriots and people of justice will immediately oppose the civil war, embark on the path of truth, and work together to build an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 胶东起义交通警察大队  成立民主救国军独立总队  独立总队司令王一藩率全体官兵举行宣誓典礼  誓与解放区军民携手合作为建立新中国而奋斗\n\n1946-08-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　胶东起义交通警察大队\n    成立民主救国军独立总队\n    独立总队司令王一藩率全体官兵举行宣誓典礼\n    誓与解放区军民携手合作为建立新中国而奋斗\n    【新华社临沂二十四日电】在南泉车站举行反内战起义之国民党交通警察十五总队第一大队正式整编为民主救国军独立总队，已于十八日下午举行隆重的成立大会，到会各界群众两万余人。主席宣布开会意义后，即在胶东区参议长王一亭代表全区一千万人民监誓下，由民主救国军独立总队司令王一藩率领全体官兵举行宣誓典礼。誓词略称：“本军官兵为反对蒋介石卖国内战政策，由南泉起义。现经全体官兵公议，定名为民主救国军独立总队，誓与解放区军民携手合作，为建立新中国而奋斗。虽粉身碎骨，亦在所不辞。如有违反誓言行为，愿受人民之制裁。”接着王一藩司令致词谓：“一周前我们和所有到会的先进朋友们还处在敌对状态，现在则已走上共同的道路。进入解放区以来，备受各界热诚欢迎与慰劳，实感激得说不出话来。今后唯有站在在人民方面奋斗到底，以表答谢。这里是人民的天下，我才敢说出结合在心里的真话。蒋介石想以特务控制部队，但决不能成功。过去我们就是戴笠一手培养的蒋的亲信嫡系，但我们都不愿以美国武器残杀自己同胞。经过这次打击，蒋介石该有所觉悟，否则我们要用他发给的武器来打击他！”胶东参议会王一亭议长及胶东行署曹漫之主任相继致词，向民主救国军独立总队全体官兵致敬与祝贺。各界群众代表献旗后，即由胜利剧团上演平剧“逼上梁山”助兴。\n    【新华社莱阳二十四日电】领导南泉反内战武装起义的国民党交通警察第十五总队第一大队王一藩（前误为王一芳）大队长，顷特撰文阐述此次举义缘由，原文略称：我们是特务头子戴笠所统率的蒋介石亲信的武装部队。在抗战期间，在国民党反动派“曲线救国”谬论指示下，一部分奉命投降日寇，结合日寇从事反共反人民的“地下工作”。抗战胜利后，又合编为国民党政府交通部交通警察，共十八个总队，我们的薪券饷因系蒋的亲信部队，故在某些地方超过其他蒋军，如主粮免配杂粮等即是。另外还有一些对蒋特别忠实亲信的特务干部，密领蒋私人津贴。我们这次在胶济线南泉举义，实出乎蒋的意料。我想他会这样想：“怪了，怎么连我亲信的部队也不听我的话了？！”这次起义的理由原很简单，就是不愿再以热血头颅为蒋个人拚命，而干违背老百姓意志的勾当。我国经八年浴血抗战，使日寇无条件投降，光复了失地，恢复了主权，全国同胞方庆和平到来，正拟共同建设国家之际，不料蒋介石包藏祸心，发动全国性内战，驱使无数青年背乡离井，充当炮灰，意在消灭民主力量，以巩固其个人的宝座。为换得美帝国主义分子之援助，蒋更不惜出卖国家主权，允外轮自由航行内河，军港飞机场都变成美海空军基地，一切措施唯美国反动派鼻息是仰，置国家于殖民地地位而不顾。再加以国民党官僚层层舞弊，到处贪民，如粮款舞弊、接受敌伪物资大舞弊案、救济物资舞弊案、京沪京杭两铁路管理局大舞弊案等，唯利是图，上下其手，致造成国内工商凋弊民不聊生之惨祸，长此以往，国将不国。深望爱国同胞正义人士，即时反对内战，踏上真理的大道，同心协力，建设独立和平民主的新中国。"

They formed stretcher teams, nursing teams, transportation teams, and propaganda teams, creating many heroic and exemplary deeds. Li Kejian, a model female teacher from Hongdong, and others ran to the battlefield and under artillery fire to work during the war, carrying wounded soldiers from the front lines. She often cared about whether the wounded soldiers' stretchers were comfortable and whether their pillows were properly placed, dedicating the enthusiasm she would have given to her husband and children entirely to the heroes of the patriotic war. One wounded soldier excitedly said, \"To die for the people of Hongdong is the most valuable and glorious thing.\" Many women from Cao Sheng Village in Subao voluntarily joined the stretcher team. They said, \"Now is wartime, not a time for family.\" Zhao Zhenying, a military dependent from Cao Sheng Village, whose father-in-law had a minor illness, said to people before leaving, \"My father-in-law is sick, but the villagers can take care of him. I want to go to the front to serve those wounded soldiers.\" She led the female stretcher team from Cao Sheng Village quickly into the rear hospitals and transfer stations. The transfer stations in Zhoubi, Subao, Hongdong, and Hetou, Zhaocheng, were entirely staffed by women. Two women took care of each wounded soldier, providing water, food, laundry, and so on. Medical staff only handled medical work. The women's enthusiasm and care deeply moved the wounded soldiers, who said, \"After recovering from our injuries, we will return to the front line and kill more enemies to repay your enthusiastic work.\" Some wounded soldiers were originally groaning in pain, but later, moved by their patient care and enthusiastic慰问, they turned from suffering to singing and laughter. An old lady named Fan Zongde from Cao Sheng Village had three of her four family members at the front. She stayed at home alone, making dry rations and boiling water for the front-line troops. Even the girls knew how much the patriotic war needed them. Li Anfei, seven years old, and Li Lanhua, eight years old, from Houhetou, also voluntarily sent firewood to the transfer station. Every day, many women brought eggs, noodles, and other items to the hospitals or transfer stations to comfort the wounded soldiers. Now, along with the men, they are carrying hoes and sweating to level the massive fortifications built by the Yan puppet troops.\n    [Our Changzhi Dispatch] The people on both banks of the Qin River gathered to celebrate the great victory in the Meng County self-defense war in northern Henan, setting off a frenzied wave of support for the army and preparing for another self-defense war. Reception stations for marching troops, wounded soldier stations, and wounded soldier hospitals were set up on all the streets of Qinyang City, and women were competing to be volunteer nurses. Representatives of the county council, the county head, and the district chiefs formed a慰问团, carrying a large number of慰问品 and over 10,000 yuan in慰问金 donated by all sectors of society, to visit the hospitals on behalf of the people of the county. At the celebration meeting in Dahongqiao Village, Wuzhi, farmers, merchants, and women all spoke. The village chief said, \"We were liberated when the Eighth Route Army came. The reactionaries want to harm us again. We must resolutely drive them back.\" The militia captain called on everyone to take up arms and fight the \"wolves\" (the local people's usual term for Chiang and his puppet troops), saying, \"Only by driving away this group of 'wolves' can the people live in peace.\"\n    [Our Handan Dispatch] The No. 1 Complete Primary School in Handan City responded to Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government's call to support the troops, and the whole school has launched a surge of troop support. Teachers, service staff, cooks, and orphaned and impoverished children left behind at school have all donated their accumulated salaries and wages to the soldiers fighting at the front. The female students are also rushing to make new clothes for the soldiers at the front overnight. In one day, the entire school donated a total of 717.5 jin of wheat, 100 jin of rice, 6.5 zhang of cloth, 2,452 yuan of Jicha, and a set of shoes and socks, and is preparing to launch a larger-scale troop support campaign after the start of the school year.

Following the breakdown of negotiations between the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army and the government on the 17th, according to an Associated Press reporter on the 22nd from Central Luzon, the People's Anti-Japanese Army is resisting the attacks of the Philippine Constabulary and regular army in three provinces in Central Luzon. The Philippine Constabulary is using American-made artillery, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The village of San Julian in Cabiao was bombarded by artillery for one hour and twenty minutes. In a village in Nueva Ecija province, the People's Anti-Japanese Army repelled over seventy attacks by the Constabulary. In other areas, the People's Anti-Japanese Army is conducting flexible guerrilla warfare, repeatedly inflicting casualties on the invaders. The peasant masses, relying on mountains and swamps, are assisting the People's Anti-Japanese Army in guerrilla warfare. It is reported that since the liberation of the Philippines, the People's Anti-Japanese Army, despite being heavily encircled, suppressed and persecuted by the American and Philippine armies, has continued to grow in strength. This is because their leadership in the struggle against landlords restoring oppression has won the support of the broad masses of the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 菲军使用美制武器  向民抗军大举进攻  民抗军领导农民进行游击战  屡次击退进犯者并予以伤亡\n\n1946-08-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　菲军使用美制武器\n    向民抗军大举进攻\n    民抗军领导农民进行游击战\n    屡次击退进犯者并予以伤亡\n    【新华社延安廿四日电】菲人民抗日军十七日与政府的谈判破裂后，据美联社记者二十二日自中吕宋报导，民抗军正在吕宋中部三个省内反抗菲宪兵与正规军的进攻。菲宪兵使用美制大炮，战事极为激烈。卡彼欧的山朱里安村遭受大炮的猛击达一小时又二十分钟，蕊瓜伊西哈省的一个村庄民抗军击退宪兵的七十余次进攻。其他地区民抗军进行着灵活的游击战，屡予进犯者以伤亡。农民群众依靠山岳沼泽，协助民抗军游击。据悉：民抗军自菲岛解放以来，虽受美菲军的重重包剿与迫害，但力量仍有增长。此乃由于领导反对地主恢复压迫的斗争获得了广大人民的拥护。"

    "content": "Chiang Kai-shek is Again Deploying Troops\n    Planning a Large-Scale Invasion of Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region\n    [Lanzhou Front, 24th dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek has recently been greatly deploying troops and generals again, deploying a large-scale offensive against our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Our army has seized an urgent order with Chiang Kai-shek's handwriting, instructing the 30th and 40th divisions originally assembled in northern Henan and half of the 51st division originally defending in Anhui to jointly attack Daokou Town, Hua County; at the same time, directing the 47th, 43rd, and 3rd divisions, etc., to quickly move to Fengqiu and attack Dongming via Changyuan. The 122nd Brigade of the 47th Division, led by Brigade Commander Zhang Xianwu, took a special train from Xuchang in central Henan northward on the 15th and arrived in Fengqiu on the 18th. Li Qixiang's unit of the 47th Division moved north from Xinyang in southern Henan on the 13th and has now arrived at Qiyi Station on the side of the Xinbian Road, and its advance troops have entered Fengqiu. According to Dongming military intelligence, a regiment of the 3rd Division has also arrived in Changyuan County, and is now actively conscripting men, seizing grain, and rushing to repair fortifications. Chiang's aircraft have also been dispatched for days to bomb Dongming, Dingtao, Cao County and other places. Dongming County alone was bombed by Chiang's aircraft four times from the 18th to the 21st. Judging from the Chiang army's attempt, it is to penetrate deep into the heart of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region with a main force to contain our army's counter-offensive on the Longhai Line, but some of the invading Chiang army, awed by the might of our army on the Longhai Line, are demoralized and panicked.\n    [Lanzhou Front, 22nd dispatch] Dong Lingwu, the Kuomintang Magistrate of Lanfeng County, who was properly protected by us during the Lanfeng Liberation Campaign, has recently revealed the tyranny of the Chiang regime based on his personal experience, stating that the entire Lanfeng County has more than 96,000 people, with an average of only 2.3 mu of land per person. Because the Yellow River has changed its course three times across the county, thousands of acres of fertile land have been turned into gravel. Whenever planting is done, fresh soil must be turned out from under the sand before sowing. In the best years, each mu of land can only yield 30 jin of grain. In addition, the people have suffered unspeakably from the eight years of Japanese rule. However, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to launch a reactionary and traitorous civil war, disregarded the life and death of the people of Lanfeng and amassed troops along the Longhai Line. This spring, there was a severe shortage of grain, and the Chiang army dispatched a requisition of 400,000 jin of grain at a time. Wealthy households fled one after another, and the entire burden fell on the lower and middle classes. After the summer harvest, a \"requisition one, borrow one\" system was implemented, and the people's grain was almost completely taken away. However, the price paid for this requisitioned and borrowed grain was only 40% or less of the market price. Therefore, the peasants' burden was actually equal to 250% of the original requisitioned amount. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called order to exempt the people in the recovered areas from land tax is just a worthless piece of paper. Before the liberation, a pound of steamed buns had risen to over 300 yuan, a pound of peanut oil to 960 yuan, and a pound of firewood to 50 yuan. Lanfeng people really got their saviors this time when they celebrated the liberation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石又在调兵遣将  图大举进犯我冀鲁豫\n\n1946-08-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋介石又在调兵遣将\n    图大举进犯我冀鲁豫\n    【陇海前线廿四日电】蒋介石最近又在大肆调兵遣将，部署对我冀鲁豫区大的进攻，我军曾缴获蒋手谕之紧急命令一份，指示其原在豫北集结之卅师、四十师及原在安徽防守之五十一师各用一半兵力，联合进攻我滑县道口镇；同时指挥四十七师、四十三师、第三师等部，迅速开至封邱，经长垣扑我东明。四十七师之一二二旅在旅长张显伍率领下，十五日乘专车自豫中之许昌向北开进，十八日已赶至封邱。四十七师李奇享部十三日自豫南信阳北开，现已到达新汴路侧之齐益车站，其先头部队已进入封邱。又据东明军息：第三师一个团并已开抵长垣县城，现正积极抓丁抢粮赶修工事中。蒋机并连日出动，轰炸我东明、定陶、曹县等地，东明县城仅十八至二十一四日内，遭蒋机轰击达四次。综观蒋军企图，系以主力一部深入我冀鲁豫腹心地区，以牵制我军在陇海线上的反攻，但部分进犯之蒋军慑于陇海我军神威，士气沮丧，恐慌万状。\n    【陇海前线廿二日电】此次兰封解放战中，为我妥为保护的国民党兰封县长董灵伍，顷就其亲身经历揭露蒋政权之暴政称：兰封全县九万六千余人，每人平均仅占有土地二亩三分，因横贯县境之黄河三次改道，致使千顷良田尽为砂砾，每当耕种，必须从沙下翻出鲜土始能下种，最好年景每亩地也仅能收三十市斤粮食。加以日寇八年统治，人民已不堪其苦，然蒋介石为发动反动卖国内战，不顾兰封人民死活，大军云集于陇海沿线。今春粮食奇缺，蒋军一次即派征借粮四十万斤，富户相率逃避，全部负担都落在中下层人民身上。夏收后，又实行“征一借一”制，老百姓粮食几乎被囊括一空，而此等征借粮，仅按市价百分之四十以下给价，因此农民的负担实际等于征借原额百分之二百五十，蒋介石所谓免征收复区人田赋之命令，仅是一纸空文。截至解放前蒸馍一斤已涨至三百元以上，花生油一斤九百六十元，柴一斤五十元。此次庆获解放，兰封人民真是得到了救命恩人。"

    "content": "[Handan, 21st dispatch] The people of various border regions, in order to crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, defend the fruits of victory in the War of Resistance, and protect the benefits gained in the emancipation movement, have launched an enthusiastic enlistment campaign. In addition to fully supporting the Jinan Front in July, the people of the Taiyue Liberated Area, in coordination with our main forces, dealt a great blow to the invading Chiang's troops. In mid-month, outstanding young people from various counties enthusiastically poured into the Eighth Route Army. In Gaoping, Jincheng, Changzi, Tunliu, Yicheng and other counties alone, more than 10,200 people joined the army. Gaoping originally estimated that 1,000 people could join the army, but encouraged by the patriotic enthusiasm for self-defense, the young people launched an enrollment competition, resulting in 2,500 young people from the county joining the army within seven or eight days. In Jincheng, at a mass meeting, as many as 500 people collectively signed up to join the army. In some counties in southern Hebei, the youth enlistment movement is equally enthusiastic. Mr. Dong Chengkui, an old man from the fifth district of Quzhou, only achieved emancipation after the Eighth Route Army liberated the area, and is now living a free and happy life. When he heard that Chiang Kai-shek was launching a large-scale attack on our border area, he angrily sent his son to the Eighth Route Army, and repeatedly told him: \"If Chiang Kai-shek comes, our common people will not be able to live. After you go to the front line, you must remember: don't come back if you don't drive away the stubborn army.\" This kind of enthusiastic hatred of the enemy made the enlistment achievements in Quzhou and Feixiang counties in southern Hebei far exceed the expected number. In the Taihang area, the enthusiasm of the masses in the new area to join the army is as active as the emancipation. In many villages, entire platoons and squads of militia poured into the Eighth Route Army. In the entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, in addition to supporting the Longhai Self-Defense Front day and night, 20,000 young men have also joined the people’s army. Currently, a mass enlistment upsurge is continuing to expand throughout the region.\n\n　　[Special dispatch from Weixian] In southern Hebei, enlisting in the army for self-defense has become a hot trend, and those who enlist are enthusiastically supported by men, women, old and young. Village-level cadres pull horses and lower stirrups, women and children vie to offer flowers, and the elderly bring fat wine and meat for farewell. Every village is filled with gongs and drums, holding farewells with slogans such as \"Fathers send their sons to the battlefield, mothers send their sons to fight Chiang Kai-shek\", which are overflowing in the clear sky of southern Hebei. Liu Zhixin from the sixth district of Quzhou is a poor peasant who used to rely on renting land for a living. After last year's rent reduction movement, the family's life has improved. His son, Shutong, is 25 years old this year and is currently the leader of the militia squad. When he heard that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas and that the old Americans were helping, he became angry. He said, \"Now Chiang Kai-shek has become the second Wang Jingwei, and the United States has become the second Japan. Anyway, poor boys can't live.\" He discussed joining the army with his father. Zhixin had long known that Chiang Kai-shek would not let the poor people turn over, so he encouraged his son to join the army. On this day, the whole village held a meeting to bid farewell. He stood on the platform in the middle of the street and shouted: \"The devils are gone, and the old Chiang is here to make trouble again, not letting us live in peace. Shutong, don't come back if you don't drive them back.\" Four or five hundred people saw them off, cheered in unison, and applauded thunderously. Cao Liyan, an old man in his sixties from Dazhai Village in the third district of Qinghe, heard that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas, glared his eyes and stomped his feet, saying: \"Chiang Kai-shek is really hateful, I will also join the army and fight him.\" The whole village persuaded him, saying: \"You are too old, it won't work.\" Cao Liyan said: \"My youngest son is only fourteen years old, what should I do?\" Everyone persuaded him: \"Fighting Chiang Kai-shek doesn't necessarily mean going to the front line, you can do some work for the families of those fighting the war at home.\" Hou Guangling from the fifth district of Xiajin used to be a company commander in the 20th Regiment, and Zhang Weisheng and Zhang Shixian were instructors. After the announcement of the Three Great Agreements this spring, they were demobilized and returned home to farm. Hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was destroying the liberated areas, it aroused common indignation. The three of them couldn't even bother to eat, so they went to gather the old soldiers of their company. Now they have reorganized their troops and set off for the front line.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边区人民奋起杀敌自卫  参军浪潮热火朝天  夏津复员连长重整队伍杀奔前线  保卫祖国！保卫和平！\n\n1946-08-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边区人民奋起杀敌自卫\n    参军浪潮热火朝天\n    夏津复员连长重整队伍杀奔前线\n    保卫祖国！保卫和平！\n    【邯郸二十一日讯】边区各地人民为粉碎蒋介石的进攻，保卫抗战胜利果实，以及翻身运动中所得的利益，展开了热烈的参军运动。太岳解放区人民，除七月即全力支援晋南前线，配合我军主力，给进犯蒋军以极大打击外，本月中旬，各县优秀青年，又热烈的涌进了八路军，仅高平、晋城、长子、屯留、翼城等县，即有一万零二百余人参军。高平原估计可有一千人参军，但因自卫爱国热情的鼓励，青年们展开了报名竞赛，致七八天内，全县从军青年达二千五百余人。晋城在一次群众大会上，集体报名参军者，竟达五百人之多。冀南有些县分青年参军运动亦同样热烈。曲周五区董成魁老先生，在八路军解放后，才翻了身，现在正过着自由幸福的生活，这次听到蒋介石大举进攻我边区，遂气愤的将自己儿子送入八路军，并再三嘱咐说：“蒋介石来了，咱们老百姓就不能活了，你去前线后，一定要记住：不打走顽固军，不要回来。”此种同仇敌忾的热情，使冀南曲周肥乡等县参军成绩，远远超过了预期的数目。在太行区，新区群众参军的热情，也同翻身一样的积极，许多村庄，民兵整排整班涌入八路军。在冀鲁豫全区群众除星夜支援陇海自卫前线外，亦有两万青壮参加子弟兵，现全区群众性的参军热潮正在继续扩展中。\n    【本报威县讯】冀南各地参军自卫已成热潮，参军者受到男女老少的热烈拥护。村级干部拉马坠蹬，妇女儿童争着献花，老人们则拿来了肥美的酒肉饯行。每个乡村都在锣鼓喧天，举行欢送“父亲送子上战场，母亲送儿打老蒋”的口号，洋溢在冀南原野的晴空中。曲周六区刘知新是个贫苦农民，过去专靠租地过活，去年减租运动后全家生活得到改善，他儿书同今年二十五岁，现任民兵班长，听说老蒋进攻解放区，还有老美帮忙，便气胀了肚子，他说：“现在老蒋成了二号汪精卫，美国成了二号日本，反正穷小子不能过。”随和父亲商量参军，知新早就知道老蒋不让穷人翻身，便鼓励儿子参军。这天全村开会欢送，他站在街中的地台上大声高呼：“鬼子完了，老蒋又来捣乱，不叫过安生日子，书同你打不退他们别回来。”四五百送别者齐声欢呼，掌声雷动。清河三区大寨村六十多岁的老头曹立言听说老蒋进攻解放区，把眼一瞪，脚一跺说：“蒋介石这小子真可恶，我也参军和他拚命去。”全村群众都劝他说：“你岁数太大了，不行。”曹立言说：“我小儿才十四岁这怎么办？”大伙劝说：“打老蒋不见得非上前线，你在家给抗属做点活就算。”夏津五区侯光岭过去在二十团当连长，张为生、张士贤当指导员，今春三大协定公布后复员回家务农，听到蒋介石摧残解放区，引起共愤，他们三人连饭也顾不得吃，就去召集自己连队的旧战士，现已重整队伍开赴前线。"

Shanghai Report: Cultural figures in Shanghai, including Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Tian Han, totaling more than forty individuals, held a grand farewell gathering on the 14th of this month for Zhou Yang, the former president of Yan'an University and a writer, as he returned to Zhangjiakou in the North. Zhou reported on his experience of being denied a passport after being invited to visit the United States, expressing gratitude for the concern of his Shanghai cultural colleagues and appealing to them to strengthen ties with the liberated areas, as well as provide assistance and guidance. Professors Wu Han, Shang Yue, and Chu Tunan from Southwest Associated University, who had recently arrived in Shanghai from Kunming, were invited to speak. Wu Han pointed out that the government's refusal to issue passports was within his expectations, but this alone was sufficient to prove who was undermining the Four Pledges and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Wu and others elaborated on the assassinations of Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu, stating that Wen's family was now suffering all kinds of persecution from Kuomintang secret agents, and had fallen into a state where they could neither live nor die. His words were filled with grief and indignation, moving the entire audience. During the gathering, participants wrote inscriptions for Zhou Yang as farewell gifts. Guo Moruo wrote: \"Arriving in Shanghai is, in fact, equivalent to arriving in the United States. There is no need to travel across the ocean. It is essential to bury oneself in hard work. I believe that our separation this time (missing number) will bring enthusiasm to our friends in the North.\" Xu Guangping wrote: \"Bring the light from afar to our side.\" Tian Han also improvised a poem for Zhou Yang: \"The east wind refuses to favor Zhou Lang, so take advantage of the south wind to return to the north. Why gild gold to make it shine? Vow to shine for democracy.\" Hu Feng's poem was: \"No gifts, just take our memories and expectations back to the North! China is now divided into two worlds, the visible and the invisible. In the invisible world, we must cross the butcher's knife and tread through thorns to complete this road, until the day we cheer and reunite under the free sunshine.\" A famous playwright wrote: \"He does not allow people to go to the United States because he is afraid that people will know he is a executioner. He is pitiful and not far from death. Let him die before you go.\" He signed it: \"On the day of issuing a statement to the executioner.\" The gathering lasted until 11 o'clock in the evening, ending in joy, with participants expressing their best wishes upon departure.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th. Shanghai Report: Guo Moruo, a leader in Chinese cultural circles, specially prepared a letter on the eve of Zhou Yang's departure from Shanghai to return to the North (the 14th), entrusting Zhou to bring it back to express his greetings to friends in the North. The full text of the letter is as follows:\n\n　　I spent a whole day reading the first collection of \"Short Stories from the Liberated Areas\" and Zhao Shuli's \"Li Youcai's Rhymes\" in one breath. This is one of the greatest joys of my life! I have never particularly liked reading novels, but this time is an exception. Such a new era, a new world, a new century of creation. Such moving deeds and facts are surely abundant in the liberated areas. I hope that friends with pens in hand will do their best to record them. Even if they are just raw materials, they are already masterpieces. When they are compiled into a huge work in the future, it will be an epoch-making great work. I hate that I am trapped in another world, too far from the light, but I hope that those who live in the light will not forget to distribute the light to all directions.\n\n　　Brother Zhou Yang will return to the bright homeland tomorrow. He asked me to write down my impressions after reading the above two books. This is a rough draft.

    "content": "Idle Talk on Trying War Criminals\n　　邢肇棠\n　　A few days ago, I wrote a short article for the Northern Magazine entitled \"A Trial That Is Both Very Clear and Very Unclear.\" The main points in the article were: \"Chinese and Japanese fascists colluded in the invasion of China, and both should be punished by law as war criminals. The Chinese fascist remnants headed by Chiang Kai-shek are not qualified to attend the Far East International Military Tribunal as witnesses. It is only natural and proper that the war criminals' defense lawyers questioned Qin Dechun, who dared not refute them, and that Tojo Hideki laughed heartily.\"\n　　Things are becoming clearer. Today, I read in the newspaper:\n　　\"Tokyo Dispatch: On the 13th, at the Far East International Military Tribunal, an American lawyer for the war criminals, Smith, argued that the Japanese invasion of China was 'legal.' He said, 'Chiang Kai-shek once requested cooperation from Japan.' The Kuomintang representative attending the court, Zhu Shiming, did not speak, tacitly agreeing that Smith was right. The war criminals roared with laughter. Chief Prosecutor Comyns Carr, a witness to the Japanese aggression in North China, was asked by Smith: 'Are you testifying that the Japanese invasion of China was legal, or are you testifying that Japan was an aggressor?' Comyns Carr said, 'Japan was wrong in North China.' Smith then said, 'Then why did you say to me in my hotel three weeks ago that there were many reasons for Japan's occupation of Manchuria and North China?' This prompted another round of laughter from the war criminals. When Chief Prosecutor Keenan saw that it was too outrageous and tried to stop the behavior of the war criminals and defense lawyers, he was protested by Chief Justice Webb.\"\n　　The Chinese people are very angry upon seeing this news, believing that the Kuomintang representative has humiliated the country and disgraced the Chinese people. In fact, this is an emotional reaction from the Chinese people who still regard the fascist elements within the Kuomintang as Chinese.\n　　Smith said, \"Chiang Kai-shek once requested cooperation from Japan,\" which is true. It is well known at home and abroad that Chiang Kai-shek, after offering the four northeastern provinces, also recognized the five provinces of North China as \"autonomous regions\" under Japanese protection, advocated \"Sino-Japanese friendship,\" pursued a policy of \"non-resistance,\" and openly cooperated with the Japanese in attacking the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas after the \"July 7th\" Incident. Even now, this set of methods is still being relentlessly continued. Cooperating with the Japanese to fight the Chinese people, asking the Japanese to \"maintain order,\" what else is this if not asking for Japanese cooperation? The Kuomintang representative attending the court, Zhu Shiming, naturally dared not say much, tacitly agreeing that Smith was right, which is only to be expected, and there is nothing strange about it.\n　　The strange phenomena in the Far East International Military Tribunal are closely linked to the strange phenomena in the Far East political situation. MacArthur's \"control\" of Japan, the \"mediation\" of the Chinese civil war under the support of American imperialist policies, and Chiang Kai-shek's \"four promises\" to the people all unanimously claim to want democracy and peace. But their actions are frantically suppressing democracy and undermining peace. This gang of hypocritical, man-eating war merchants are exactly the same as the Japanese war criminals, with no difference whatsoever. In order to deceive the world, they have to feign \"trials\" and \"testimony.\" How can their terribly hypocritical faces not provoke laughter from the war criminals?\n　　The reactionary judges and defense lawyers at the Far East International Military Tribunal, as well as the Japanese war criminals and Chinese representatives, understand each other and are mutually understanding. They all exchange glances and are single-mindedly plotting how to exonerate their comrades—the war criminals. The so-called \"trial\" is merely a way to prolong life. What they temporarily do without people knowing, what they consider a secret, what they don't say but constantly think about in their hearts is a brilliant plan to quickly start a third world war. If this suicidal policy called \"strategy\" can be secretly realized while people all over the world are sleeping, then they will be satisfied, immediately tear off their masks, cancel the \"trial\" formality, gather together, and then launch another killing spree against the honest people who regard them as democratic leaders, only then can their virtue be displayed. It would also be more worthy of the deceased Mussolini and the missing Hitler.\n　　It is obvious to all that today's American imperialists are inheriting the fascist Japan of the \"July 7th\" Incident, and Chiang Kai-shek is inheriting the traitor Wang Jingwei of the Nanjing puppet government. The filial sons and virtuous grandsons who inherit their ancestors' legacy naturally believe that their ancestors' invasion of China was \"legal,\" the attack on Pearl Harbor was a \"misunderstanding,\" and the occupation of the Philippines was to maintain the \"New Order\" of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\" It is justified and reasonable, so what \"law\" is being violated?\n　　Originally, imperialism and fascism are as black as \"a crow flying on a pig's back.\" They only ended up with family ruin and scattered members due to the uneven distribution of spoils. Now they still have to sing a \"bitter pill\" show in court. It's really in terrible shape, simply \"threading tofu with a horse's tail\"—impossible to mention!\n　　A group of armored, man-eating beasts are squatting on Chinese territory, sucking the blood of the Chinese people while baring their teeth at democratic countries around the world. The Chinese people are bravely carrying out a war of self-defense. Peace-loving democratic countries and working people all over the world are also collecting their hunting rifles, preparing to eliminate this group of beasts. Look!

    "content": "Two Worlds\n    Wang Yaping\n    The Kuomintang-controlled areas and our liberated areas, ostensibly both under the same blue sky of China, have formed two worlds in terms of politics, military affairs, economics, culture, education, and people's lives. I have just stepped into this free place, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area, where the masses are rising up. Naturally, I have not seen or heard much, and my understanding is limited, so I cannot offer profound impressions. However, just based on my shallow observations and a comparison with the poor and filthy Kuomintang-controlled areas, one immediately feels the contrast between the two worlds, creating two different forces: one is vigorously rising, while the other is declining. This time, I left Chongqing—that garbage city—went through the Three Gorges, passing through Yichang, Shashi, Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, and then to Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, before returning here. I traveled through most of the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and the impression it left on me is that the countryside is filled with disasters, hunger, disease, and death. The broad masses of the people auction off their eggs, chickens, ducks, cotton yarn, crops, and even their blood, sweat, and lives, but still cannot get enough to eat. As a result, some eat all the grass roots and tree bark and starve to death, while others flee to the cities in groups. Women become hired laborers, helping people cook and wash clothes, while men are dragged away by the Kuomintang army, forced to dig trenches and build碉堡 [diaobao, pillboxes] in preparation for the civil war. What about the cities? They are filled with terror, theft, debauchery, and corruption. Prices rise wildly without end, business is sluggish, factories close down, workers are unemployed, and American goods flood the market. Those with money become wealthier, living a \"Americanized\" and \"scientific\" life, while the majority of citizens head towards death under hunger and hardship. An old man once told me with emotion, \"Now it is a world of ghosts, not a world of people, it is not as good as the Qing Dynasty.\" This is the Kuomintang-controlled area in the mouths of the people. In such a dark area, I fought hard for eight years. I longed for the day I could dedicate myself to the liberated area, to study, to fight, and to dedicate everything to the cause of people's liberation. When I first stepped into this green and youthful land, I saw majestic militiamen, carrying guns and walking on the main roads beside the growing fields. From their expressions, you could tell that they had the courage and confidence to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army to defend the liberated land. Rural women are spinning and doing women's work, while men are working in the fields and learning to shoot. The merchants in the cities are all living in peace and working happily. Here, military, government, cultural, and educational personnel all wear the same coarse cloth clothes as the people, eat the same simple food, and walk all over the streets without finding a single gorgeously dressed figure. Even someone as shabbily dressed as me, wearing only a starlight shirt and a pair of Chinese gabardine pants, would be considered strange in the eyes of the people, which made me feel very ashamed. Prices in the market are five times cheaper than in Chongqing and ten times cheaper than in Nanjing and Shanghai. Walking through the stores, I couldn't find a single trace of foreign goods, which made me feel that this was a real place for Chinese people. I heard that the people here are carrying out a great turnaround movement, and they have already settled the blood debts owed to the people by landlords, traitors, and war criminals. It is a pity that I have not yet seen these great and magnificent scenes with my own eyes. The cultural and educational work here is also actively promoted in coordination with this \"great turnaround\" movement. Although it is only preliminary sowing work, it will surely sprout, grow leaves, bloom, and bear fruit. I really want to congratulate myself for stepping from a corrupt, dark, and terrifying zone into this newly born, bright, and free zone. \"The people will transform history.\" Today, this sentence has been better proven in the facts I have seen.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 两个世界\n王亚平\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　两个世界\n    王亚平\n    国民党的统治地区和我们解放区，按说同样在中国的蓝色天空下面，但无论从政治、军事、经济、文化、教育以及人民生活任何方面来看，都形成了两个世界。我是刚刚踏进了这一块自由的地方，人民群众正在翻身起来的冀鲁豫解放区，自然看到的听到的不多，认识的不多，不能说出深刻的印象，但只就我实浅的观感和那贫困的龌龊的国民党统治地区一作比较，就立刻叫人感到两个世界的对比，造成了两种不同的力量，一边正在蓬勃的上升，一边正在没落下降。这次我离开重庆——那个垃圾都市，出三峡、经宜昌、沙市、汉口、九江、芜湖、到了京、沪、杭州，再折回又到了这里，把国民党统治的地区走了一个大半，它给我的印象，是乡村里走满了灾害，饥饿、疾病、死亡，广大人民把自己的鸡蛋、鸡、鸭、棉线、农作物、甚至血汗、生命，都拍卖了贡献出来，还得不到温饱，于是有的把草根树皮吃尽了，就活活的饿死，有的成群的流亡到都市，女的充雇工，帮人烧饭、洗衣服，男的被国民党的军队拉走，迫使他们挖战沟、筑碉堡，准备打内战。都市里呢？充满了恐怖、偷盗、荒淫、贪污，物价无止境的狂涨，商场萧条，工厂倒闭，工人失业，美国货充斥于市场，有钱的越有钱，过着“美国化”，“科学人”的生活，大多数市民则在饥寒困苦下走向死亡，一个老百姓曾感慨地告诉我说：“现在是鬼世界，不是人世界，还不如清朝好。”这就是人民口中的国民党统治地区。在那样黑暗的地区，我坚苦地抗斗了八年，我渴望有一天投身到解放区，学习、战斗，把一切献给人民解放事业，当我第一天踏进这样绿色的青春的土地，我就看见了雄壮的民兵，背着枪走在田禾生长的地边大路上，从他们的神色上可以告诉你，他们有勇气有信心协同八路军保卫解放的土地。乡村的妇女在纺织做女工，男子们出力下田学习打枪，城市里的商民，都安居乐业，喜形于色的生活着，在这里军政文教人员都和人民穿一样的粗布衣裳，吃一样的粗陋饮食，走遍四条大街，找不到一个衣装华丽的人物，就像我这个衣着最蹩脚的人，只穿一件星光衬衫，一条中国哔叽裤子，在老百姓眼睛里，能够奇异了，这叫我感到十分惭愧。街市上物价比重庆便宜五倍，比京沪便宜十倍，走遍各家商店找不到一星星洋货，使我感到这才是真正的中国人的地方。听说这里的人民正做着大翻身运动，他们业已清算了地主、汉奸、战争罪犯欠下人民的血债，可惜这些伟大壮烈的场面，我还没有亲眼看到。这里的文化教育工作也正配合这个“大翻身”运动，积极地推进开展着，虽然还只是初步的播种工作，但它一定会生芽，长叶，开花结实的。我真要为自己庆幸，我从一个腐败的，黑暗的，恐怖的地带，走进了这个新生的，光明的，自由的地带。“人民会改造历史的”，今天这句话更在我所看到的事实中得到更好的证明了。"

Recently, when Taiwanese people go to the market to buy vegetables, some call out \"buying Chen Yi's stagnant money,\" meaning they want to buy a yuan's worth of pig liver. Now, Kuomintang government officials in Taiwan dare not show their faces in public as they did when they first arrived, nor do they dare to wear uniforms, otherwise, they risk being beaten by the people. Someone used a dog and a pig to darkly compare the Kuomintang and Japan, saying: \"Dogs can guard the door, pigs only know how to eat. The dogs left, and the pigs came; what use are pigs?\" With the public sentiment like this, some officials who have already amassed fortunes feel that their time is running out, and \"of the thirty-six stratagems, running away is the best,\" and they are leaving Taiwan one after another.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 五天五地\n\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　五天五地\n    据天津益世报载台湾通讯称：民谣中的“五天五地”是台湾政治情形的很恰当描写。日寇投降前，美国飞机大炸台湾，这是“惊天动地”。日本投降了，台湾老百姓迎接国民党的接收大员“欢天喜地”。而接收大员回答老百姓的欢迎，钱袋装得饱饱的，于是茶楼、酒馆、妓院就热闹起来了，“花天酒地”。紧接着就是百业萧条，物价飞涨，“民不聊生”，“昏天黑地”，结果台湾老百姓完全失望了，在他们的心中滋长着愤怒和怨恨，这就到了最末一个时期：“怨天怨地”。\n    台湾人过去把日本帝国主义称为狗，现在他们把国民党官僚称为猪，或“猪肝”（台湾人读“猪官”）。近来台湾人上市买菜，有呼“买陈仪闭塞钱”者，其意即欲买猪肝一元。现在在台湾的国民党政府官员，已不敢如初来时那样抛头露面出门，也不敢穿着制服，否则便有被老百姓痛打一顿的危险。有人用一只狗，一条猪来暗比国民党和日本道：“狗可守门、猪一味吃，狗走猪来，要猪何用”？民情如此，有些已经腰缠万贯的官员，亦感之日将届，“三十六计，走为上计”，纷纷离台他去。"

They successively recovered strongholds such as Wanxin, Lamadi, and Liuxu, and liberated over 20 surrounding villages. In mid-April, when over a thousand Chiang soldiers forcibly crossed the Jinxian River, attempting to invade Zhongdaza and Nandaza (southeast of Baoding), the militia detonated a series of linked landmines, killing 78 Chiang soldiers. Due to the disparity in numbers, they actively withdrew from their positions. They encircled the two villages with a network of landmines, and at the same time, dispatched small groups of militia to cross the river and infiltrate areas occupied by Chiang's troops, such as Goutou, Balizhuang, Beidaza, and the outskirts of Baoding, actively carrying out activities. They destroyed a Chiang military transport vehicle and killed and wounded three Chiang officers and soldiers. The arrogance of Chiang's and puppet troops was greatly reduced, and small units dared not move freely, eventually forcing the main force stationed in Nandaza to withdraw north of the river (Jinxian River). In the past two months, the militia on the east side of the Pinghan Railway have also crushed over 20 offensives by Chiang's and puppet troops against the liberated area of Diaoxianzhuang. A certain village single-handedly repelled eleven Chiang troop offensives and recovered over 20 carts of wheat. A dense array of landmines once killed 18 Chiang soldiers. On July 13th, when Chiang's and puppet troops set out for Dahuaqiao, they triggered a giant landmine, resulting in over 30 Chiang soldiers being killed or wounded, and an American-made machine gun was also blown to scrap metal.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保定民兵坚持游击战  粉碎蒋伪军蚕食进攻  一颗巨型地雷毙伤蒋军三十余\n\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　保定民兵坚持游击战\n    粉碎蒋伪军蚕食进攻\n    一颗巨型地雷毙伤蒋军三十余\n    【新华社河间二十五日电】保定解放区民兵，曾以顽强的游击战争，粉碎蒋军从四月以来以一万七千余兵力的二百余次蚕食进攻，毙伤蒋伪军二百余人，先后恢复宛新、喇嘛地、刘叙等据点，解放周围村庄二十余处。四月中旬蒋军千余人，强渡金线河，进窥中大再、南大再（保定东南）时，民兵拉响连环地雷阵，炸毙蒋军七十八名后，以众寡悬殊，主动撤离阵地。以地雷网将该二村团团封锁，同时派遣小股民兵渡河潜入蒋军侵占的沟头、八里庄、北大再和保定城郊积极活动，曾炸毁蒋军运输汽车一辆，毙伤蒋军官兵三名，蒋伪凶焰乃大大收敛，小股兵力不敢自由行动，最后被迫将驻南大再的主力，撤回河（金线河）北。近二月来，平汉路东侧的民兵，亦粉碎了蒋伪军二十余次向解放区雕贤庄的进攻。某村并单独击退蒋军十一次进攻，夺回小麦二十余车，以密布的地雷阵一次炸毙蒋军十八名。七月十三日蒋伪出发至打花桥时，触发一枚巨型地雷，蒋军伤亡三十余名，一挺美式机枪也被炸成废铁。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 24th: According to Chongqing newspapers, regarding the forced takeover of the Labor Association: At 7:00 AM on August 6th, representatives from the KMT-controlled \"Chongqing General Labor Union\" suddenly arrived at the Chongqing office of the China Labor Association, leading over 200 fully armed military police, plainclothes agents and forcibly took over the Labor Association office and its affiliated worker welfare center, labor hospital, nursery, worker cultural service center, and art studio. Traffic was cut off, and police were densely deployed, as if facing a major enemy. Thirty-eight Labor Association personnel were arrested, including Ms. Zhou Ying, director of the association's worker welfare center, and Zhao Shuwen, director of the labor hospital. They were taken to the Chongqing Municipal Criminal Police Department on trumped-up charges of organizing an \"assassination squad,\" and tortured to extract confessions. Shi Yiwu, an unemployed worker and Labor Association member, had four front teeth knocked out. Worker Chen Daoquan suffered severe injuries from clubbing. Tang Xiangjie, head of the welfare center's service group, was also beaten with clubs. The arrested personnel were subjected to abuse and went on a hunger strike in protest. At 7:00 PM on August 8th, Zhou Ying and 27 others were escorted to the local court by plainclothes agents and armed soldiers. At 5:00 PM on August 10th, plainclothes agents with guns coerced the Daliangzi Labor Association welfare center to hand over account books and safe deposit box keys, and seized documents, seals, and Ms. Zhou Ying's personal seal in an attempt to forge documents and frame the arrested personnel, in order to cover up their violent act of seizing the Labor Association.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Shanghai News: Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, held a reception for the press in Shanghai on the 8th regarding the KMT authorities' forcible seizure of the Chongqing Labor Association. After reporting the details of the incident, Mr. Zhu pointed out that a week before the incident, the *Laosheng Bao* (Labor Voice), run by Deng Faqing, the person in charge of the Chongqing General Labor Union (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek controlled labor union), fabricated news that the Labor Association was organizing an assassination squad with ulterior motives. When the incident occurred, the various institutions of the Chongqing Labor Association, located more than 20 *li* apart, were simultaneously seized by illegal armed forces. All these signs indicate that it was undoubtedly a planned action. Regarding the organization and activities of the association, Mr. Zhu said: The Labor Association was established in Shanghai in February 1935. In 1939, it joined the International Labor Federation. In 1944, it co-sponsored the organization of the World Federation of Trade Unions with the British, French, and Soviet Trade Unions and the American Industrial Union, and was elected Vice-Chairman of the Congress. The Labor Association is the only organization in China for workers to participate in the international labor movement. To date, the Labor Association includes more than 9,000 units with 2,175,177 members. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, it led the National Workers' Anti-Japanese General Association, organized workers to participate in the anti-Japanese war, and assisted 4,130 military transportation technicians. The Association has established various worker welfare organizations in Chongqing, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. Mr. Zhu also said: The Labor Association has suffered attacks more than once in the ten years since its establishment. Last year, representatives of the Labor Association were unreasonably arrested in Guangzhou, and they were threatened to stop activities in Hankou, Tianjin, and other places. Finally, Mr. Zhu, on behalf of the Shanghai General Labor Association, made three demands to the authorities: release the arrested, punish the perpetrators, and guarantee protection in the future.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Shanghai News: Ms. Zhou Ying, Director of the Chongqing Office of the China Labor Association and Director of the Worker Welfare Center, and 27 others are still being held in prison. The Shanghai General Association has received letters from them in prison, requesting assistance in rescuing them. It is reported that Zhou Ying and others are currently imprisoned in a dark room of only ten feet square, and are being subjected to abuse. The agents are also forcing everyone to do hard labor. Zhou Ying's ten-year-old child is also among those arrested and is forced to make a pair of cloth shoe soles every day; failure to do so results in severe whipping.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 劳协被非法逮捕人员  惨遭国特严刑拷打  朱学范氏要求当局惩凶\n\n1946-08-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　劳协被非法逮捕人员\n    惨遭国特严刑拷打\n    朱学范氏要求当局惩凶\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】据重庆报纸报导劳协被强占经过称：八月六日晨七时，渝市中国劳动协会办事处突来国民党官办“重庆总工会”代表，率领军警便衣特务二百余人，全副武装，强行接收劳协办事处及附属之工人福利社、劳工医院、托儿所、工人文化服务社、美工堂等机构，一时交通断绝，岗警密布，如临大敌，并逮捕劳协人员三十八人，包括该会工人福利社主任周颖女士及劳工医院院长赵书文等，先后押至渝市刑事警察处，诬以组织“暗杀团”之莫须有罪名，并曾动刑逼供。失业工人、劳协会员再瑞武被打脱门牙四颗，工人陈道全遭受棍打重伤，福利社服务组长汤湘洁亦受棍击。被捕人员身受虐待，曾绝食反抗。八日下午七时，周颖等二十八人才由便衣特务及武装士兵押解移送地方法院。十日下午五时，大梁子劳协福利社复被便衣特务持枪威迫交出账册、保险箱钥匙，抢去社中文卷图记及周主任（周颖）私章，企图伪造证件，诬陷被捕人员，以掩饰其强占劳协之暴行。\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：中国劳动协会理事长朱学范氏为国民党当局强占渝劳协事件，八日在沪招待新闻界。朱氏在报告事件经过后，指出事件发生前一周，渝市总工会（按即蒋方御用工会）负责人邓发清所主办的《劳声报》，即捏造劳协组织暗杀团图谋不轨之消息。事件发生之时，渝劳协各机构相距二十余里，均于同时为非法武装强占。由此种种迹象观之，乃为有计划无疑。谈及该会之组织及活动，朱氏称：劳协在民国二十四年二月成立于上海，民国二十八年加入国际劳工联合会，一九四四年会同英法苏总工会与美国产业工会发起组织世界工会联合会，当选大会副主席。劳协为中国工人参加国际工运之唯一组织，迄目前止，劳协所属包括九千多单位，拥有会员二百一十七万五千一百七十七人。抗战后曾领导全国工人抗敌总会，组织工人参加抗战工作，先后协助军运技工四千一百三十人。该会在重庆及西安兰州均设立各种工人福利组织。朱氏并称：劳协成立十年来，工作遭受打击不止一次，去年劳协代表在广州被无理追捕，在汉口、天津及各地亦被威胁停止活动。最后朱氏代表上海劳协总会向当局提出释放、惩凶及今后保障三项要求。\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】沪讯：中国劳协渝办事处职员及工人福利社主任周颖女士等二十八人，迄今犹被押狱中。上海总会已接获彼等自狱中所寄出之信件，要求设法营救。据悉：周颖等现被囚于方圆仅十尺之暗室内，备受虐待，特务并强迫各人做苦工。周颖之十余岁孩子亦在被捕之列，每天并被罚做布鞋底一双，如违则惨受鞭打。"

As a result, labor unrest rapidly unfolded. The labor unrest was also linked to the movement to expose traitors and the struggle against the slave abuse of foreign companies. The labor unrest reached its peak in February and March, which was the first stage of the Shanghai labor unrest.\n\n　　In the first stage of the labor unrest, the Kuomintang authorities had already adopted repressive measures against the workers, and after the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the suppression became even more cruel. Gu Zhenggang, one of the CC Clique leaders, rushed to Shanghai and announced to worker representatives and journalists on April 5 that strikes and slowdowns were not allowed, \"If violated, the government should effectively stop them.\" Subsequently, the so-called \"Labor-Capital Dispute Review Measures\" of April 24 were promulgated, which was actually a repressive measure to force workers not to strike or slow down. At the same time, from March onwards, tragic incidents occurred constantly, and the labor unrest in April was relatively low. But even under the most brutal suppression, the workers still fought unyieldingly. The labor unrest in April still included the silk weaving industry, customs, printing industry, egg factory, bathhouse, canteen, and the newly joined Reuters, Associated Press, United Press, naval factory, shipyard workers, and the re-strike of 50,000 rickshaw pullers. This was the second stage. The labor unrest in May and June rose even higher, and the scope was greatly expanded, including heavy industry, banking, and even the entertainment industry. Among them, the labor unrest in the Western clothing, barber, and soda industries caused a sensation throughout the city. For example, more than 800 employees in the entire barber industry held a bloody clothes parade to petition against the authorities' suppression. The mothers and wives of the murdered workers also set off in tricycles with the team. The reason why the labor unrest rebounded in May was due to the dumping of American goods, which led to factories reducing production and closing down, reducing wages for workers, and causing a large number of workers to become unemployed.\n\n　　At this time, the Kuomintang reactionaries adopted new methods of both hard and soft tactics. In late May, Gu Zhenggang rushed to Shanghai again to actively carry out activities to \"weaken the labor unrest.\" On May 29, Wu Guozhen and Gu Zhenggang summoned representatives of various industries to give instructions and announced five repressive measures against the labor unrest. On May 31, Shanghai launched a shocking demonstration and petition. More than 1,000 unemployed workers from Chongqing who came to Shanghai sat at the gate of the Social Affairs Bureau and carried a coffin to the City God Temple, expressing their determination to sacrifice themselves. The authorities dispatched more than 200 police officers to suppress them, carrying machine guns, rifles and other weapons, but they were angrily snatched away by the workers. Finally, the workers' representatives found Zhao Banfu, the director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and asked him to resume work. Zhao remained silent, prompting the workers to shout, \"Is there a solution? If there is no solution, please resign quickly!\" \"We have prepared the coffin, today either you die or I die!\" After a standoff until 2 pm, Zhu Xuefan of the Labor Association arrived and set out three measures, including issuing each person a bag of flour. In order to further deal with the workers' movement, the reactionaries convened \"instructions\" to trade associations and representatives of various factories for days from June 1st, held \"labor-management symposiums\" and \"weakening\" labor unrest meetings of military, political and police departments, and instigated the official General Labor Union to convene meetings of employee representatives. On the one hand, they falsely claimed to \"save\" the industrial crisis, attributed the \"workers' lack of labor discipline\" as one of the causes of the crisis, and Gu Zhenggang once again proposed that strikes and slowdowns should not be allowed at will, and that excessive demands should not be made, forcing the General Labor Union to accept this \"instruction\"; on the other hand, using a gentle deception method, they claimed to \"establish labor-management cooperation factories.\" According to the CC Clique's plan, they wanted Jiang to allocate more than 110 \"received\" factories for the establishment of cooperative factories, with the \"government providing factory buildings, the industrial sector raising working capital, and unemployed workers contributing labor.\" This kind of cooperative factory, as the Shanghai General Labor Union itself claimed, was to ask the workers to \"tighten their belts to tide over the difficulties,\" and was a plan to plunder the funds of the industrial sector and expand the territory of the CC monopoly. On the 3rd, employee representatives openly opposed the cooperative factory method at the meeting. More than 50 worker representatives from the tram union, foundry industry, silk weaving industry, knitting industry, canned food industry, and wine industry unanimously believed that the industrial crisis was caused by political instability, endless civil wars, and bureaucratic capital monopoly. They loudly raised the slogan \"To save the industrial crisis, we must immediately stop the civil war\" at the meeting, and proposed to immediately organize an \"anti-civil war alliance.\" The reactionaries slandered the workers, saying: \"The labor unrest\" destroyed \"social order\" and \"production order,\" but the workers' struggle actually made the greatest efforts to maintain social order. When the British Electricity Company workers were in the most intense struggle, although they slept on the cement floor of the factory during the Lunar New Year, they still provided services such as repairing electric lights for the citizens as usual, and 15% of the staff continued to generate electricity. When the French and British water and electricity companies slowed down, they also tried their best to maintain water and electricity so that the lives of the citizens would not be affected. All trams and buses ran as usual, but no tickets were sold, which was called \"treating everyone,\" and even搶車 rushed out of the factory and ran under machine guns to maintain the city's traffic.\n\n　　The reactionaries slandered the workers for not taking care of the difficulties of the capitalists, but in fact, the workers took great care of the capitalists, but it was the constant breach of trust by the Kuomintang authorities and the capitalists that forced the workers to expand the struggle.\n\n　　Taking the customs employees' slowdown as an example, on February 23, they requested that relief funds be issued for two months and that wages be issued according to the cost of living index. After the authorities agreed, they suddenly reneged, which led to the re-slowdown on April 26. Later, the authorities increased the salary of the Tax Commissioner by 40%, but the low-level staff only increased the allowance by 2.75%, which aroused the third slowdown on May 15, demanding equal treatment for all employees, including all employees except senior staff, and even 30 of the senior staff also believed that the demands and behavior of the employees were justified. For example, on March 13, the Shanghai Police Bureau arrested workers from the Xinyu Yarn Factory and shot and injured female worker Hu Fengshi. Tens of thousands of workers from the Hudong and Huxi yarn factories slowed down to protest, but they still voluntarily worked one more day on Sunday the 17th to make up for the losses suffered by the capitalists for three days, thus winning widespread social sympathy.\n\n　　In the surging movement, the employees showed unparalleled unity and organizational power. Those employed and unemployed, adults and child laborers, formal workers and apprentices... all received mutual support and help in terms of demands and materials. Not only could many industrial workers (such as 40,000 to 50,000 workers from cotton and wool weaving factories in the third and fourth districts, 10,000 employees from 400 motor and silk weaving factories in the first, second, third, and fourth districts) act quickly and consistently, but also handicraft workers (such as 4,000 employees in the paint industry and 2,000 employees in the shoemaking industry) and shop assistants (such as 4,000 employees in the nine major department stores and 2,000 employees in the fashion industry) could gather for petitions in a short period of time. Even street cleaners, rickshaw pullers, and construction workers, who were in a more scattered state, could use their own well-organized picket teams to go through the streets and alleys, help their colleagues to awaken, and guarantee the strike and petition parade of 20,000 construction workers, 50,000 rickshaw pullers, and 7,000 street cleaners.\n\n　　Employees seized every opportunity to establish various organizations. New workers' own trade unions grew and developed under the oppression of the old official trade unions and the reactionaries. According to Zhu Xuefan's statistics, after the victory, the workers had established 280 trade unions with 300,000 workers participating, including restaurants, dance halls, and barbershops. More than 90% of the members participated in the founding meetings of these trade unions. Although these figures include a part of the trade unions that the authorities tried to control, they can also give a glimpse of the wide range and strength of the workers' organizations. Many trade unions conducted extremely democratic elections and had many outstanding leaders.\n\n　　The Shanghai Workers' Association (and the Shanghai General Labor Union, which was used by the reactionaries against it) has also been established as a city-wide employee organization. In January, they proposed to the Political Consultative Conference to establish a coalition government, set up a labor department, revise labor laws and regulations, determine the rights to organize trade unions and strikes, and eliminate the remnants and influence of fascism in factory management. On May Day, they issued a letter to workers, specifically proposing four tasks for Shanghai workers: 1. Eliminate fascism in any form and make democracy and freedom victorious; 2. Start work and resume work, oppose comprador slave thought, and prevent China from falling into the abyss of colonies and semi-colonies; 3. Realize labor-management cooperation on a democratic basis; 4. Strive to study and improve cultural, political, and technical progress.\n　　 @\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 半年来的上海工人运动\n徐方略　黄＠\n1946-08-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　半年来的上海工人运动\n    半年来上海工潮的高涨，已形成为“五卅”、“九一八”两个辉煌时代以后所未有的规模。\n    去年胜利以后，由于绝大部分工厂不能复工，工人大批失业，迄年底工潮达一千余件。至今年一月，物价高涨，工人陷于饥饿状态，西南各省工人大批流落沪上，寻觅不到工作，因之工潮急速展开。工潮并与检举汉奸的运动和反对外商公司的奴隶虐待的抗争联系，至二三月工潮发展达最高峰，这是上海工潮的第一个阶段。\n    在工潮的第一阶段中，国民党当局对付工人已采取了镇压的手段，而在国民党二中全会以后，镇压尤为残酷。ＣＣ派头子之一谷正纲赶到上海，四月五日向工人代表及新闻记者宣布不准罢工怠工，“如果违反，政府应加有效制止”。随之公布了四月二十四日的所谓“劳资纠纷评论办法”，实即强制工人不能罢工怠工的镇压办法。与这同时，从三月起，不断的发生惨案基因而四月份的工潮比较低落。但就是在最残暴的镇压下，工人仍不屈不挠的抗争。四月的工潮尚有丝织业、海关、印刷业、蛋厂、浴室、膳堂及新加入的路透、合众、美联各社、海军工厂、造船厂工人和五万人力车夫的再度罢工，这是第二阶段。五六两月的工潮更加高涨，范围也大大扩大，包括着重工业、银行业乃至娱乐界各业，其中西服、理发、汽水等业的工潮，轰动全市，如全体理发业职工八百余人，为抗议当局镇压，举行血衣游行请愿，被害工友的母亲、妻子也乘三轮车随队出发。五月份工潮重趋高涨的原因，乃由于美货倾销下，工厂纷纷减产停闭，对工人减发工资，并造成大批工人的失业。\n    这时国民党反动派采取了新的软硬兼施的办法。五月下旬，谷正纲再度赶到上海积极进行“消弱工潮”的活动。五月二十九日，吴国桢、谷正纲召集各业职工代表训话，宣布了五条镇压工潮办法，三十一日，上海就揭起了惊人的示威请愿。重庆来沪的失业工人一千多人，坐在社会局门口，并抬了口棺材放在城隍庙里，表示不惜牺牲的决心。当局先后共派二百余警士镇压，携有机关枪、长枪等武器，但被工人群众愤怒夺去。最后工人代表找到了社会局劳工处长赵班斧，向他要求复工，赵一声不响，激起工人们高呼“有办法么，没有办法请赶快辞职”！“我们已预备好棺材，今天不是你死就是我死”！相持到下午二时，劳动协会朱学范赶到，才定出每人补发面粉一包等三项办法。反动派为了进一步对付工人运动，自六月一日起，连日召集同业公会及各工厂代表“训话”，举行“劳工座谈会”及军政警各有关机关“消弱”工潮会议，并策动官办的总工会召集职工代表会议，他们一方面假借“挽救”工业危机名义，倒果为因的把“工人缺乏劳动纪律”归为危机原因之一，谷正纲再度提出不准任意罢工怠工，不提过高要求，迫使总工会接受这一“指示”；另一方面，用怀柔欺骗的手法，宣称要“建立劳资合作工厂”，按照ＣＣ派的计划，要蒋一百数十家“接收”工厂拨为建立合作工厂之用，由“政府供给厂屋，工业界筹集流动资金，失业工人贡献劳力”。这种合作工厂正如上海总工会方面所自称的，是要工人“束紧腰带渡过难关”，是搜刮工业界资金，扩大ＣＣ垄断事业地盘的计划。三日，职工代表在会议中，公开反对合作工厂的办法，电车工会、翻砂业、丝织业、针织业、罐头食品业、酒业等工人代表五十余人，一致认为工业危机皆因政治不安定，内战不休，官僚资本垄断所致，他们大声在会上提出了“要挽救工业危机，必须立刻制止内战”，并提议马上组织“反内战大同盟”。反动派诬蔑工人谓：“工潮破坏”了“社会秩序”与“生产秩序”，但职工们的斗争，实际尽了最大的努力来保持社会正当秩序。英商电力公司工人在斗争最剧烈时，虽睡在工厂水门汀上过旧历年，但对市民修理电灯等事务，仍照常服务，并有百分之十五人员在继续发电。法商、英商水电公司怠工时亦尽力维持水电，使市民生活不受影响。各路电车、公共汽车一律行驶，只是不售车票，称为“大请客”，甚至还在机关枪下抢车出厂行驶，维护市民交通。\n    反动派诬蔑工人之不照顾资方困难，其实职工们是非常照顾资方的，只是由于国民党当局和资方的不断失信，迫使工人不能不扩大斗争。\n    以海关职工怠工来说，二月二十三日要求发救济金两月，工资按生活指数发给，当局答应后，忽又反悔，才形成四月二十六日的再度怠工。以后当局对税务司增加百分之四十，但低级职员仅增津贴百分之二点七五，于是又激起五月十五日第三次怠工要求上下职工待遇平等，内除高级职员，职工全部加入，就是高级职员中的三十人，也认为员工的要求和行为是正当的。又如三月十三日，上海警局逮捕新裕纱厂工人，并枪伤女工胡冯氏，沪东、沪西纱厂数万工友怠工抗议，但他们仍于十七日星期日又自动工作一天，以补上三日资方所受的损失，因此获得了广大的社会同情。\n    在汹涌的运动中，职工们表现了无比的团结力和组织力，在业和失业，成年和童工，正式工和练习生………要求上、物资上都得到相互的支持和帮助，不仅许多产业工人（如三、四区棉毛织厂四五万工人，一、二、三、四区四百家电机，丝织厂万名员工）都能很快的一致行动，就是手工业工人（如油漆业四千员工、制履业二千员工）、店员（如九大百货公司四千职工，时装业二千员工）也能在短期间集合请愿，即令处于更散漫状态的清道夫、黄包车夫、土木工匠等，也都能以自己组织精密的纠察队穿街入巷，帮助同业觉悟，保证了二万土木工匠，五万人力车夫和七千清道夫的罢工和请愿游行。\n    职工们争取每一个机会，成立各种组织，新的工人自己的工会，在旧的官办工会及反动派压迫下成长和发展了起来。据朱学范统计，胜利后，工人已成立的工会有二百八十个，参加的工人有三十万，其中包括菜馆、跳舞厅、理发馆等。这些工会的成立大会，有百分之九十以上的会员参加，这些数字虽包括了官方力图控制的一部分工会在内，但也可窥见工人组织的广泛和强大。许多工会进行极民主的选举，拥有许多杰出的领袖。\n    全上海范围职工组织，有上海工人协会（和他对立的是反动派御用的上海总工会）亦已成立。一月间他们曾向政协提出成立联合政府，设立劳工部，重订劳工法规，确定组织工会罢工示威等权利，及根绝工厂管理中法西斯的残余和影响等提案。五一节又发表告工友书，具体提出上海工人的四项任务：一、消灭任何方式之法西斯主义，使民主与自由获得胜利；二、开工复工，反对买办奴隶思想，使中国不要坠入殖民地、半殖民地的深渊里去，三、在民主基础上实现劳资合作；四、努力学习，提高文化、政治、技术上的进步。\n        ＠"

    "content": "The Taihang District Party Committee Issues Emergency Notice\nCalling on the Entire District to Immediately Prepare for Self-Defense\n[This Dispatch from Our Changzhi Bureau, August 25th] After receiving the Central Bureau's emergency call to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and strive for victory in the patriotic war, the Taihang District Party Committee immediately held a special discussion. On the 17th, it issued an emergency notice stating: All levels of organizations throughout the district, upon receiving this notice, should immediately convene meetings to discuss the Central Bureau's August 15th call and the August 17th *Liberation Daily* editorial. First, they must be ideologically mobilized and universally launch a patriotic movement against the sale of the country and the civil war. It must be ideologically clear that the American imperialist elements are unreasonably aiding Chiang, and Chiang Kai-shek is shamelessly selling out the country, colluding with each other to undermine China's independence, democracy, and peace, and launching a reactionary civil war. In contrast, we are opposing treason and aggression, defending democracy, and protecting the justness of the fruits of the people's democratic victory. The fruits of the War of Resistance are the result of our own bloodshed, sacrifice, and hard struggle, and we must never allow Chiang Kai-shek, that bandit leader, to rob them and sell them to the United States in exchange for his dictatorial rule, allowing imperialism and compradors to put a new yoke around our necks. The historical mission of restoring peace and realizing independence and democracy is the unshirkable responsibility of the Party, government, army, and people of the liberated areas. The people of the whole country place their hope in us. We must smash Chiang Kai-shek's civil war plan. Chiang Kai-shek is selfish and selling out the country, losing popular support and becoming isolated, appearing strong but inwardly weak, corrupt, and incompetent. Although he has American aid, he is bound to fail. The Party, government, army, and people of the liberated areas are defending the interests of national independence and democracy, which is a matter of course, gaining widespread support, solidifying unity, and ensuring victory with righteous indignation. Expose decadence and point out progress and development. Use the comparison of the two forces to illustrate the inevitable prospect of victory. However, it must be pointed out that victory will not come naturally; victory depends on a confident struggle. Therefore, comrades on all fronts must be careful and prudent, avoid arrogance and rashness, and guarantee victory.\n\nIn order to victoriously strike the traitorous Chiang army, strategic advances and retreats, and temporary gains and losses of a city or a place are inevitable and there is no need to panic. After the main force retreats, a guerrilla movement must be launched to attack and harass the Chiang army. All localities must make ideological and organizational preparations.\n\nThe Party, government, army, and people should be mobilized to immediately prepare for self-defense and resistance. Everything is for enriching and supporting the victory of the front line. Launch a new patriotic heroism movement on all fronts. All localities should immediately and conscientiously implement this notice upon receiving it.\n\n[Another Dispatch] The Taihang District Party Committee, Military Region, and other organs held a mobilization meeting for cadres on the morning of the 24th at the Military Region's residence to prepare for the patriotic self-defense war to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Comrade Li Xuefeng of the District Party Committee gave a report, pointing out that since Chiang Kai-shek's ascent to Lushan and the issuance of the Marshall joint statement, the situation of fighting while negotiating has turned into a full-scale civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek. Only with the victory of the self-defense war can peace be restored, and democracy and independence be guaranteed. He then analyzed the difficulties and weaknesses of the Chiang side in carrying out the civil war, and the basis for the inevitable victory of self-defense. He pointed out that during the negotiation period of the past month, we won the sympathy of the people of the whole country, especially the middle class, so that the people of the whole country can recognize the national character of today's self-defense war and place the country's independence, democracy, and peace on our self-defense victory. At the same time, we also gained time to further consolidate the liberated areas, reorganize the troops, and improve combat effectiveness. Comrade Xuefeng called on all cadres to mobilize and urgently devote themselves to the righteous self-defense war. Everything is for the front line, everything is for the victory of self-defense. Respond to the Central Bureau's emergency call, overcome all individualism, complacency, hedonism, and feelings of disappointment with the current situation. Promote new heroism, unite comrades, unite and educate the masses, pool our wisdom and efforts, and strive for victory. He also called for cherishing the people's strength, economizing on resources, and taking a long-term view to support the war. On the same day, the Administrative Office also conducted cadre mobilization, with Director Li Yiqing giving a report. The next day, cadres of various organs launched discussions and will carry out extensive publicity to the masses in the vicinity of their residences on September 2nd.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行区党委发出紧急通知  号召全区立即准备自卫\n\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行区党委发出紧急通知\n    号召全区立即准备自卫\n    【本报长治二十五电】中共太行区党委接到中央局粉碎蒋介石进攻、争取爱国战争胜利的紧急号召后，立即作了专门的讨论，并于十七日发出紧急通知称：全区各级组织于接本通知后，应立即召开会议讨论中央局八月十五日号召及八月十七日解放报社论，首先从思想上动员起来，普遍展开反对卖国内战的爱国主义运动。思想上必须明确美帝国主义分子无理地援蒋，蒋介石无耻的卖国，狼狈为奸，破坏中国独立、民主、和平，发动内战的反动性，和我们反对卖国侵略、保卫民主、解放人民民主胜利果实的正义性。抗战果实是我们自己流血牺牲艰苦奋斗得来的，绝不能任彼蒋介石贼头子抢劫去卖给美国，换取他的独裁统治，让帝国主义与买办给我们颈上再套一付新的枷锁。恢复和平，实现独立民主的历史任务，是我们解放区党政军民义不容辞的重担，全国人民都把这希望寄于我们。我们必须粉碎蒋介石的内战计划，蒋介石自私卖国，失道寡助，众叛亲离，外强中干，腐烂无能，虽有美助必败；解放区党政军民维护民族国家独立民主利益，天经地义，得道多助，各界响应，团结坚实，哀兵必胜。揭发没落腐朽，指出进步发展，用两种力量的对比说明胜利的必然前途，然又必须指出胜利不会自然到来，胜利依靠于有把握的斗争。因此各个战线的同志必须小心谨慎，力戒骄傲轻率，保证胜利。\n    为了胜利的打击卖国的蒋军，战略战术上的进退，一城一地暂时得失必不可免，无须惊慌，必须在主力撤退之后，展开游击运动，给蒋军以袭击困扰，各地须作思想上组织上的准备。\n    党政军民全体动员起来，立即准备自卫应战。一切为着充实支援前线胜利而斗争，展开各个战线上的爱国新英雄主义运动。各地接到通知立即认真执行。\n    【又讯】太行区党委、军区等机关干部为粉碎蒋介石进攻准备爱国自卫战争的动员大会，已于二十四日上午在军区驻地举行，由区党委李雪峰同志报告，指出自蒋介石上庐山、马司联合声明后，一面打一面谈的局面已变成蒋介石发动的全面内战，必须有自卫战的胜利，和平才能恢复，民主独立才有保障。继即分析蒋方进行内战的困难与弱点，和自卫的必胜根据，并指出一月以来的谈判期间，我们争取了全国人民特别中间人士的同情，使全国人民能够认识今天自卫战争的民族性，而把国家的独立民主和平寄托于我们的自卫胜利上，同时还争取了时间，进一步巩固了解放区，整训了部队，提高了战斗力。雪峰同志号召一切干部动员起来，紧急投入正义的自卫战，一切为了前线，一切为了自卫的胜利，响应中央局的紧急号召，克服一切个人主义、麻痹享乐以及对时局的失望情绪；发扬新英雄主义，团结同志，团结与教育群众，群策群力，争取胜利。并号召爱护民力，节约资财，长期着眼，以支持战争。同日行署机关亦进行干部动员，由李主任一清报告。次日各机关干部已展开讨论，并将于九月二日由各机关在驻地附近向群众作广泛宣传。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Cui Tianfu, Acting Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions, sent a telegram to Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Director of the China Labor Association, stating: \"I have just learned that the Chongqing Labor Association and its Workers' Welfare Cooperative, which it organized, were forcibly taken over by special agents in the name of the bogus \"Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions\" a few days ago, and more than 30 Labor Association staff members were arrested. This move is clearly a further crime by the reactionaries to destroy people's organizations and deprive people of their rights. The Labor Association, under your leadership, has been painstakingly managed and has achieved remarkable results. We, the members of this association, are all indignant at this brutal trampling. I represent all the workers in the liberated areas in lodging a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities, and hope that you will persevere and strive for recovery. Our association is pledged to be your support!\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 25th: Regarding the forcible takeover of the Chongqing office of the China Labor Association by the Kuomintang authorities, and the assault and arrest of personnel by special agents, the reporter specifically interviewed Zhu Baoting, a veteran of the Chinese workers' movement and member of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions. Old Zhu said: \"This incident is yet another manifestation of the fascist atrocities of the Kuomintang authorities in destroying workers' freedom of assembly, association, and personal freedom.\" Old Zhu continued: \"The China Labor Association united the worker masses during the War of Resistance Against Japan, supported the war, and strived for the welfare and freedom of workers. After the war, under the leadership of Mr. Zhu Xuefan, it fought alongside the broad masses of people throughout the country to win domestic peace and democracy, and won the support of workers in the Kuomintang areas. Last year, the Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions joined the association, making it the largest mass organization of workers in China. The Chiang Kai-shek government's violent destruction of the Labor Association is clearly aimed at undermining this powerful and prestigious people's organization in the peace and democracy movement, so that it can carry out the civil war even more unscrupulously.\" Mentioning the arrest of members of the Workers' Welfare Committee, Old Zhu was particularly indignant. He said: \"Workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are unemployed, starving, and dying in the streets. The Chiang government not only ignores this, but also cruelly destroys workers' organizations that seek their own welfare, determined to cut off the workers' path to survival.\" Old Zhu finally made a powerful judgment: \"Chinese workers will never allow Chiang Kai-shek to continue this illegal atrocity. I believe that workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will surely rise up to defend their own democratic and survival rights, oppose internal warfare and dictatorship, and fight resolutely for national peace and democracy. The workers and people of the entire liberated area must give them effective assistance.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 崔田夫电慰朱学范氏  抗议国民党摧残劳协  朱宝庭同志痛斥蒋政府非法暴行  号召全解放区职工有效支援劳协\n\n1946-08-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　崔田夫电慰朱学范氏\n    抗议国民党摧残劳协\n    朱宝庭同志痛斥蒋政府非法暴行\n    号召全解放区职工有效支援劳协\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】中国解放区职工联合会筹备会代主任崔田夫电中国劳动协会主任朱学范先生称：“顷悉重庆劳动协会与其所举办的职工福利社于日前被特务机关假“渝市总工会”名义武力接收，并捕去劳协职员三十余人，此举显系反动派更进一步摧残人民团体、剥夺人民权利的罪恶。缘劳动协会在先生领导下，惨淡经营，成绩卓著，今次遭此横暴蹂躏，敝会同人闻此，莫不愤慨。我代表解放区全体工友们向国民党当局提出严重抗议，并希再接再厉，力争恢复，敝会誓为后盾！”\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】为中国劳动协会重庆办事处被国民党当局武力接收、人员遭特务殴打与逮捕事，记者特走访中国职工运动老前辈解放区职工联合会筹委会委员朱宝庭氏，朱老谈称：“这一事件，是国民党当局摧残工人集会结社人身自由的法西斯暴行之又一表现。”朱老继称：“中国劳动协会在抗战中团结工人群众，支持抗战，并为职工谋福利争自由；抗战以后，该会在朱学范先生领导下，和全国广大人民一起为争取国内和平民主而奋斗，深得国民党区域职工的拥护。去年解放区职工联合会加入该会，使该会成为全中国工人自己最广大的群众组织。蒋介石政府以暴力破坏劳协，显然是为了破坏这一和平民主运动中有力量有威信的人民团体，以便更肆无忌惮的进行内战。”提到工人福利委员的被捕时，朱老尤为愤慨，他说：“国民党统治区工人失业，饥饿倒毙街头，蒋政府不但置之不理，而且当工人组织自谋福利的社团时，蒋政府不惜加以摧残，必使工人生路断绝而后快。”朱老最后下了一个有力的判断：“中国工人决不容许蒋介石继续这一非法暴行，我相信国民党统治区的工人，一定会起来为保卫工人自己的民主和生存权利、反对内战独裁、争取全国和平民主而坚决斗争。全解放区的职工和人民，一定要给他们以有效的援助。”"

    "content": "“A Day in the Life of a Nursery” Heads to America\n　　People outside the Border Region can hardly imagine how happily the little babies of Yan'an live. The artist Comrade Meng Huafeng recently created a series of 25 comic strip drawings entitled \"A Day in the Life of a Nursery\" for the little angels' paradise – the Second Nursery. In addition to being displayed in Yan'an, a specially bound copy was presented to Ms. Soong Ching Ling (Soong is a Standing Committee member of the China Welfare Fund in Shanghai, and is keen to donate to help the Border Region's childcare cause) to soothe her distant thoughts. The American journalist Roy Singer, who recently left Yan'an, also took a copy to be read by people in the United States who care about the liberated areas.\n　　Thirty Million \"Xingzhi Scholarship\"\n　　The Yan'an Memorial Preparatory Committee for Mr. Tao Xingzhi wrote to the Border Region Government proposing to allocate 30 million Border Region currency as the \"Xingzhi Scholarship,\" specifically to reward research work in primary school education in the Border Region; and to rename \"Yan'an Middle School\" as \"Xingzhi Middle School.\" These two proposals to commemorate Mr. Xingzhi have been officially approved at the ninth administrative meeting of the Border Region Government.\n　　Literary and Art Circles Discuss Current Tasks\n　　The Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau convened literary and art circles to discuss the specific tasks of the literary and art circles. At the meeting, Propaganda Minister Li Zhuoran said: \"The literary and art circles in the Border Region, following the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao at the Forum on Literature and Art, have begun to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have produced excellent works such as 'The White-Haired Girl' and 'Blood and Tears of Hatred.' However, there are still shortcomings in creation. In the future, we must learn from some model works such as 'Li Youcai's Rhymes,' constantly improve ourselves, and draw materials from actual life.\" Regarding current literary and art activities, Li proposed: \"Under the severe situation of the Kuomintang reactionaries actively launching a full-scale civil war, the literary and art circles should write more works to encourage the masses' confidence in victory. At the same time, we should pay attention to strengthening the education of current affairs propaganda so that the broad masses of the people understand the current political situation. Therefore, literary and art workers must go to the countryside.\"\n　　Lost and Found: Please Check the Notice Board\n　　A lost and found notice board was hung on the wall of the New Market entrance. One day, it read: \"Found: one donkey, one bar of soap, one key. Please come to the No. 2× office to claim.\" Many owners were overjoyed to find their lost items. The head of Luojiaping Township in Yan County lost a donkey three months ago and had given up hope. He found its whereabouts on the notice board. Before leaving, he bought the policeman a pack of cigarettes as a reward, but the policeman refused. According to the person in charge of the Public Security Bureau, in the past six months, the people have claimed the following items: 14 head of cattle, 6 horses, 22 donkeys, 4 taels of gold, 1 bar of soap, 2 towels, 1 toothbrush, 25 receipts, and 1 key.\n　　Athletes Will Show Their Skills\n　　The Border Region troops are currently assembling athletes to come to Yan'an to attend the \"September 1st\" Sports Meeting. It is reported that Xu Guang, a famous basketball player from the Seventh Branch School (who attended the Far Eastern Games), will form a basketball team to compete against Liu Shanben and other air force personnel. The Joint Defense Command has also formed a women's volleyball team and is currently stepping up practice after dinner every night. They will show their skills at the time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “延安市闻”五则\n\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“延安市闻”五则\n            《保育院一天的生活》赴美\n    边区以外的人们很难想像到延安的小宝宝们怎样过着幸福的生活。美术工作者孟化风同志，新近为小天使们的乐园——第二保育院——绘图二十五幅连环画《保育院一天的生活》，在延陈列展览外，特装订一本赠宋庆龄氏（宋为上海中国福利基金委员会常委，热心捐款帮助边区保育事业者），以慰遥念。最近离延的美国记者罗辛格，也带走一本给美国关心解放区的人士阅览。\n        三千万“行知奖学金”\n    延安追悼陶行知先生筹备会，致函边府提议拨付边币三千万元，作为“行知奖学金”，专门奖予边区小学教育的研究工作；把“延安中学”，改名“行知中学”。此两项纪念行知先生的提议，已在边府第九次政务会上正式通过。\n            文艺界座谈当前任务\n    西北局宣传部召集文艺界，座谈当前文艺界的具体任务，会上宣传部长李卓然说：“边区文艺界，遵循毛主席在文艺座谈会上所指出的方针，开始为工农兵服务，且产生了《白毛女》《血泪仇》等优秀作品，但创作方面仍有缺陷，今后要向一些模范作品如《李有才板话》等学习，不断提高自己，从实际生活中去吸取题材。对于目前文艺活动，李氏提出：在国民党反动派积极发动全面内战的严重局势下，文艺界在创作上多写鼓舞群众胜利信心的作品，同时应注意加强时事宣传的教育，使广大人民群众，了解当前的政治形势，因此文艺工作者必须下乡。\n            失主请看招领牌\n    新市场口的墙壁上，挂了一个招领牌，有一天上面写着“拾毛驴一头、肥皂一块、钥匙一把，希失主来二×所认领”。许多失主都喜出望外的找到了遗物。延县罗家坪乡长，在三个月前跑了一匹毛驴，他已经绝望了，又在领牌上找到下落，临走时他给警士买了一条纸烟作报答，警士谢而不收。据公安局负责人谈，半年来民众领回去的东西，有耕牛十四头、马六匹、毛驴二十二头、金子四两、肥皂一条、毛巾两条、牙刷一把、发单二十五张、钥匙一个。\n            运动员将大显身手\n    边区部队现正调集运动选手来延出席“九一”运动大会，闻七分校著名篮球选手徐光（曾出席远东运动会）将组成一队篮球队，与刘善本等空军人员对抗，联防司令部亦已组成一女子排球队，现每日晚饭后，正加紧练习，届时当大显身手。"

    "content": "The Chengcí County Leadership Unleashes\n    Over a Hundred Villages Launch Purge Movement\n    [Our newspaper, Weixian News] Chengcí County corrected its \"not letting go\" work style, and over a hundred villages launched a purge movement. The anti-traitor movement in the county began in late April, but because the leadership had a \"fear of leftism\" mentality, cadres were constrained and acted as substitutes, and the masses never truly mobilized. In mid-July, after the peasant turnaround team arrived in the county, they cooperated with the county to jointly hold meetings for district and village cadres in three districts, re-emphasizing the need to boldly let go and let the masses grasp the policies. They emphasized taking care of the interests of middle peasants, uniting the majority of peasants to participate in the turnaround movement, controlling peasant armed forces, and cracking down on traitorous and special agent sabotage activities, thoroughly resolving the cadres' thinking. The turnaround team was divided into groups to create experiences in various base villages. In less than a month, most villages had launched a vigorous movement to speak out about grievances. In Shangcheng Town, peasants and those who had turned themselves around, under the slogan of \"first pull out the tough nails,\" overthrew local bullies and landlords Wang Shiqing, Zheng Zuchang, and others, greatly delighting the people. Merchants and middle peasants widely joined the movement. Landlord lackey Wang Lantong and the militia captain who had been bought off by the landlord both confessed to the masses and exposed the landlord's conspiracy. A broad-based movement for peasants to speak out about grievances is about to unfold. Although Dongbao Village had undergone joint struggles, because the cadres were controlled by local bullies and landlords and separated from the masses, the masses had no confidence in turning themselves around. After the turnaround team understood the situation, they secretly contacted activists while educating the village chiefs who were taking the landlord's line. Lian Zhuang, Tailian Zhuang, and six other villages have formed a large alliance. Changquan Village appropriately distributed the fruits of struggle, strengthened internal unity, and Wang Hengcheng and other seven villages, with thousands of peasants, formed a large alliance, struggling against local bullies and landlords Wang Yongliang and four others. Zhao Jia Zhuang transformed the village government controlled by the landlord, and the masses gradually became active. The Chengcí mass movement is developing vigorously.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 成磁县领导上放开了手  百余村掀起清算运动\n\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　成磁县领导上放开了手\n    百余村掀起清算运动\n    【本报威县讯】成磁县纠正不放手作风，百余村庄掀起清算运动，该县反奸运动，四月底即已开始，但因领导上存在“怕左”思想，干部束手束脚，包办代替，群众始终没有真正行动起来。七月中旬农民翻身队到达该县后，与县里配合，共同召开了三个区的区村干部会议，重新强调提出大胆放手，把政策交给群众掌握。强调照顾中农利益，团结大多数农民参加翻身运动，掌握农民武装，打击奸特破坏活动等，彻底打通干部思想。翻身队分组到各基点村创造经验。不到一月，大部村庄已掀起了轰轰烈烈的诉苦运动。商城镇农民和翻身者在“先拔硬钉子”的口号下，斗倒了恶霸地主王士清、郑祖昌等，人心大快。商人与中农普遍投入运动。地主狗腿王兰桐，和被地主收买的民兵队长，均相继向群众坦白，并揭露地主阴谋。广大农民诉苦运动即将展开。东保庄虽进行过联合斗争，因干部被恶霸地主掌握，脱离群众，群众对翻身没有信心。翻身组了解情况后，一面抓紧积极分子进行秘密串连，一面教育走地主路线的村长，连庄、泰连庄等六村，已组成大联合。长券村适当的分配了斗争果实，加强了内部团结，王横城等七村，数千农民组成了大联合，斗争了恶霸地主王永亮等五人，赵家庄经翻身改造了地主掌握的村政权，群众才逐渐活跃，成磁群运正猛烈开展中。"

    "content": "【Our Newspaper, Yangcheng News】In August, the Jincheng sub-district held a rally of ten thousand activists to mobilize the continued implementation of the mass emancipation movement in the self-defense war, and to overcome the \"almost there\" mentality of cadres and activists. The mass movement in the county had been brought to a standstill in mid-July due to the participation in the war and the military enlistment campaign. Some cadres, seeing the enthusiastic and fervent participation in the war and military enlistment, became complacent and felt that the masses had been almost completely emancipated, and that there was no need for further in-depth implementation. Upon discovering this problem, the leadership convened rallies of ten thousand activists (approximately one thousand in each district) in nine districts from July 29th to August 4th, reflecting and raising many issues. During the discussion of \"whether it is possible to defeat the reactionary's offensive if the masses are not emancipated or not thoroughly emancipated,\" everyone recalled the painful lessons of the December coup, when the masses were not emancipated, resulting in bloody devastation by Yan's puppet regime. Some pointed out that special agents were active, cooperating with the stubborn army's offensive, such as the Wangtai special agent in the Second District who controlled a group of militiamen, and some special agents secretly poured out the gunpowder from the militiamen's bullets and replaced it with earth. Some raised the issue of illegal landlords colluding with special agents in an attempt to \"reverse the emancipation,\" and discovered the \"three joys and three sorrows\" of the local tyrants and illegal landlords - they were happy to hear that Chiang Kai-shek was fighting a civil war and prepared to organize internal responses; however, most villages had militiamen monitoring them, and they could not carry out activities, which was one joy and one sorrow. Later, many militiamen and activists went to support the front line, and they thought they had obtained a good opportunity for activity; however, as news of victory continued to arrive, their hopes of the stubborn army were shattered, which was two joys and two sorrows. Some cadres were deceived by the \"almost there\" mentality, and the movement came to a standstill, and the landlords were secretly happy; however, they heard that the district was holding a meeting of activists in early August, and the movement was about to resume, and they became afraid again, which was three joys and three sorrows. After discussing these many issues, the \"almost there\" mentality of cadres and activists was shattered, and it was realized that the anti-civil war must be combined with the mass movement, and only through the thorough emancipation of the masses can the reactionary offensive be defeated with powerful guarantees.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋城万余积极分子集会讨论  自卫战中要贯彻群运  群众翻透身是胜利的有力保证\n\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋城万余积极分子集会讨论\n    自卫战中要贯彻群运\n    群众翻透身是胜利的有力保证\n    【本报阳城讯】八月在晋城分区召开万人积极分子大会，动员在自卫战争中坚持贯彻群众翻身运动，打通干部与积极分子的“差不多”思想。该县群运于七月中旬因参战、参军运动而陷于停顿。有些干部看见轰轰烈烈的参战运动员兴奋而形成自满，认为群众翻身已翻得差不多了，用不着再深入贯彻了。领导上发现这个问题，即于七月二十九日到八月四日，先后在九个区分别召开了万人（每区一千左右）的积极分子大会，反映和提出了许多问题。当讨论“群众没翻身或没翻透身能不能打垮反动派的进攻”时，大家都回想到十二月政变时，由于群众没有翻身，致遭阎伪血腥蹂躏的惨痛教训。有的提出特务正在活动，配合顽军进攻，如二区王台特务掌握了一班民兵，有的特务暗将民兵子弹的火药倒出来换上土等。有的提违法地主与特务勾结，企图“倒翻身”，并发现恶霸与违法地主的“三喜三悲”——他们听说蒋介石打内战便高兴，准备组织内应；可是大多数村里都有民兵监视，活动不开，这是一喜一悲。后来许多民兵、积极分子都支援前线去了，他们以为得到了活动良机；可是胜利消息不断传来，他们盼望顽军的希望幻灭了，这是二喜二悲。有些干部被“差不多”思想迷惑，运动陷于停顿了，地主们暗中高兴；可是又听说八月初区上开积极分子会议，运动又要重新展开，又害怕起来，这是三喜三悲。这许多问题，经过讨论，打破了干部和积极分子的“差不多”思想，认识到反内战必需和群运结合，只有群众翻透身，才是打垮反动派进攻的有力保证。"

    "content": "Tens of Thousands of Demobilized Soldiers from Jin-Cha-Ji\n    Indignantly Defend Their Homes Against Chiang's Offensive\n    Zhangjiakou Celebrates First Anniversary of Liberation with Enthusiasm\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 24th] The border region resolutely implements the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the troop reduction plan. More than 100,000 border region soldiers who gloriously returned to their hometowns, in light of the increasingly urgent attacks by Chiang's troops, are rising up to defend their homes. An Pang×, a demobilized soldier from Anzhuang, returned to his village in April. When his village was occupied by Chiang's troops, he immediately gathered a dozen village cadres and civilians to form a small armed force, conducting propaganda and organizing the masses for self-defense in nearby villages. He once led militiamen to destroy a Chiang's army bunker at a local farm and captured fifteen armed secret agents and smugglers. Li Gongzhan, a demobilized soldier, actively organized local mass armed forces to combat Chiang's and puppet troops' harassment and defend the masses after returning to his hometown in March. Zhang Xiuji, a 40-year-old veteran from Xiazhijing, Fanshi, followed the troops in fighting under the rain of bullets from the Yan's puppet army when the Eighth Route Army disarmed the puppet troops in Fanshi city a month ago, and successively seized two rifles and one Mauser pistol. He also actively helped train the village militia and encouraged young people to bravely join the war. Chen Xi, Ren Mingliang, and other demobilized soldiers from Shacheng, led fifteen young partners to the democratic government to request to go to the front line, and told their fellow villagers: \"We originally hoped for peace, but now Chiang Kai-shek is attacking again, forcing us to no longer live in peace. You must intensify production and consolidate the rear as you did during the Anti-Japanese War, and we will go to the front.\" Wei Shoushan, a demobilized soldier from Peishan Village, joined the militia joint defense operations command, preparing to organize widespread mass guerrilla movements once Chiang's troops invade.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 25th] \"August 23rd\" is the first anniversary of the liberation of Zhangjiakou. On this day, all city agencies, factories, and schools broke with the usual holiday tradition and worked hard all day long. Mobilization rallies in each district to defend the liberated areas and support the front lines were held separately in the evening. In the Fourth District alone, more than 20,000 people attended, and at least 100,000 of the city's 170,000 residents participated in these rallies on this day. The news that Chiang's side openly and shamelessly declared that it would attack Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde universally aroused the people's indignation in all meeting places, factories, workshops, shops, streets, and alleys. A primary school teacher in the Third District said: \"Last year on this day, the Eighth Route Army removed the shackles from our bodies. Under the leadership of the democratic government, we have united as one and built a free and prosperous city. Chiang Kai-shek is guilty of losing Zhangjiakou and has not contributed to the liberation and construction of Zhangjiakou. On what basis does he want to extinguish this beacon of peace? The people of Zhangjiakou resolutely will not allow the reactionaries' snouts to reach in.\" At the meeting in the Fourth District, many people requested on the spot to join the Eighth Route Army and go to the battlefield for self-defense. This righteous act immediately spread throughout the district. Merchants and residents of Wu Bao Street immediately elected representatives to raise a large number of comfort goods and sent them to the homes of soldiers and workers who joined the army amidst the sound of gongs and drums.

The letter, telegraphed on the evening of the 23rd, stated: As a result of the irresponsible policies of the current Greek government, a certain situation has arisen in the Balkans. Numerous border conflicts between Greece and Albania were instigated by the Greek army with the connivance and encouragement of the Greek government. The Greek army systematically fired at Albanian border guards and farmers. Foreign troops are still stationed in Greece, supporting collaborators and suppressing patriotic fighters. Under these circumstances, holding a plebiscite on the restoration of the monarchy is contrary to the war aims of the Allied powers.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th—Shanghai Dispatch: After Chiang Kai-shek's \"August 13th\" proclamation was issued, Mr. Shen Junru, representative of the China Democratic League, made a commentary here on August 14th. Regarding the six guidelines he proposed for handling the current situation, he believed that, based on the experience of the past six months of negotiations, unless the government is reorganized and all political issues are resolved through consultation in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and the principles of the draft constitution, any method proposed unilaterally without consultation as the main approach will not achieve any results. Regarding the Youth Party's suggestion that the Kuomintang convene a \"cessation of hostilities\" meeting in Lushan in an attempt to force the democratic parties to submit to unreasonable demands, Shen stated: Apart from resolving domestic political issues by following the resolutions of the PCC, any new approach that overturns the PCC resolutions, such as \"cessation of hostilities\" meetings, will not yield any results. He and his colleagues in the Democratic League firmly oppose this.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th—Shanghai's \"Era\" magazine, issue 170, commented on Chiang Kai-shek's \"August 13th\" Lushan proclamation, stating: \"Although Chairman Chiang repeatedly says that he will definitely implement the PCC resolutions,\" in reality, there is not a single point that conforms to the PCC resolutions. For example, taking the six guidelines he mentioned, none of them conform to the PCC resolutions: First, the PCC resolutions do not stipulate that the National Assembly should be convened on November 12th; second, the resolutions in the PCC resolutions regarding the principles for amending the draft constitution are not to be provided for national discussion and selection, but rather for the National Assembly to discuss and implement; third, regarding expanding the foundation of the government, the proportion and candidates are to be discussed and decided by the PCC. The PCC did not stipulate that the Kuomintang should invite participation unilaterally; fourth, regarding the cessation of conflict, the agreement never contained any provisions regarding the Communist army withdrawing from certain areas that already constitute a \"threat to peace\" and \"obstruct traffic\"; fifth, regarding political disputes, the government has consistently stated in the past that the Communist army has not faithfully implemented the sincerity of stopping the conflict and restoring traffic, so it has never really intended to adopt a political solution; sixth, the current threats to the people's peace, security, and life and property are mainly due to the rampant activities of special agents and thugs actively launched by the authorities. The guarantee of the people's basic rights, which was clearly stipulated in the PCC resolutions and personally permitted by Chairman Chiang at the opening of the PCC, has not been fulfilled at all. Where is there any compliance with the PCC resolutions? In fact, Chairman Chiang's entire proclamation, when stripped bare, is nothing more than: \"You Communists deserve to die, and I should launch a full-scale civil war to eliminate you!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沈钧儒氏评蒋介石文告  须循协商解决国是  反对其他片面办法\n\n1946-08-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沈钧儒氏评蒋介石文告\n    须循协商解决国是\n    反对其他片面办法\n    【新华社延安廿四日电】沪讯：蒋介石“八一三”文告发表后，民盟代表沈钧儒氏，于八月十四日在此间发表评论，对其所提出之六项处理时局之方针，认为根据半年来谈判的经验，除非遵照政协决议宪草原则以协商方式进行改组政府，解决一切政治问题外，任何不以协商为主而由片面提出的办法，将不会获致任何结果。关于青年党建议国民党在庐山召开“息争”会议，企图压迫民主党派屈服于无理要求一事，沈氏称：除遵循政协决议解决国内政治问题外，任何推翻政协决议之新方式如“息事”会议之类，都决不会有任何结果。对此，渠个人暨民盟同人坚决反对。\n    【新华社延安廿五日电】沪时代杂志第一百七十期评论蒋介石“八一三”庐山之文告称：“蒋主席虽然口口声声说一定实行政协决议”，实际上却没有半点合乎政协决议的地方。譬如就其所举的六项方针而言，就没有一项是合乎政协决议的：第一、政协决议并没有规定十一月十二日召开国民大会；第二、政协决议中关于宪草修改原则的决议，不是提供国家讨论选择，而是要国大商讨执行的；第三、关于扩大政府基础，是要由政协讨论决定比例及人选的，政协并没有规定要由国民党一党邀请参加；第四、关于停止冲突，协定中也从无关于要共军撤出若干已经构成“和平威胁”和“阻碍交通”的地区的规定；第五、关于政治纷争，政府过去一贯是说共产党军队没有忠实执行停止冲突、恢复交通的诚意，因此也一直未打算真正采取过政治解决的；第六、目前造成对于人民安居乐业和人民生命财产的威胁的，主要由于当局所积极发动的特务暴徒的横行，政协决议中所明白规定和蒋主席在政协开幕时所亲自允许关于人民基本权利的保障，到现在一点也未见兑现。这那里有符合政协决议的地方？实际上蒋主席全部文告拆穿了，还不是一句：“你共产党罪该万死，我应该进行全面内战消灭你！”"

According to two notes from Yugoslavia to the U.S. on August 14th and August 20th, \"Since July 16th (that is, the fourth day after the end of the Second Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, at which the four foreign ministers accepted the French proposal on the Italian-Yugoslav border), U.S. aircraft have systematically intruded into Yugoslav airspace 216 times in 35 days.\" At 1:00 PM on August 9th, U.S. \"BA\" No. 47 aircraft appeared again over the Yugoslav Ubuna Airport at an altitude of 1,000 feet and was forced to land by Yugoslav fighter planes. However, on the night of the 21st, Azerson delivered an ultimatum to the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires in the U.S., Makido, demanding in extremely rude terms that Yugoslavia release the U.S. aircrew detained on August 9th within 48 hours of receiving it, and threatening Yugoslavia with a request for \"sanctions\" from the Security Council.\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] Belgrade News: Yugoslavia has refused to accept the U.S. ultimatum. Belgrade Radio quoted a statement from the Secretariat of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia on the 23rd, saying that Marshal Tito refused to accept the U.S. ultimatum, because the U.S. pilots who were forced to land on August 9th after intruding into Yugoslav airspace had already been released almost as soon as the U.S. ultimatum arrived in Belgrade, and Yugoslavia had agreed that the U.S. could come to Yugoslavia to repair its second crashed aircraft on August 19th themselves. Marshal Tito made the following statement to a Yugoslav interviewer from the London Daily Telegraph on the 23rd: \"I believe that the U.S. aircraft deliberately violated our airspace in order to create the impression that the U.S. power is so overwhelming that the Yugoslav government will be forced to endure everything. When entire teams of aircraft circle our airspace, this is a very obvious fact.\" Marshal Tito also rebuked U.S. military aircraft for intentionally scouting Yugoslav military equipment on the Italian border when answering reporters from the Associated Press on the 24th. Tito declared: One of the purposes of this illegal flight over Yugoslavia is to scout our garrison defense zones and borders.\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] New York News: The Chairman of the National Peace Conference announced that retired Marine Corps Colonel Carlson issued a statement to the press on the 3rd, saying that the U.S. ultimatum to Yugoslavia was imitating the methods used to deal with Greece, Palestine, and Transjordan. The threat of force is being used to support the sharp words published in Paris and Washington, which not only order the defeated countries of World War II, but also order the victorious countries to submit to Anglo-American peace.\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th] It is reported that Yugoslavia has submitted the matter of the U.S. illegally detaining Yugoslav ships to the Security Council on the 23rd. The Yugoslav representative to the Vice-Chairman of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Sformel, sent a letter to Secretary-General Lai Shi on the 23rd, requesting that the agenda of the next meeting of the Security Council should include the issue of the U.S. illegally detaining Yugoslav ships. There are a total of 171 ships mentioned above, most of which are ordinary mail ships, which were detained by the U.S. authorities in the U.S. occupied areas of Germany and Austria when they occupied Germany. On the same day, U.S. officials claimed that if Yugoslavia agrees to the international co-management of the Danube River plan proposed by the U.S. at the peace conference, the U.S. will release these ships. Regarding this statement, the Belgrade \"Glas\" newspaper called it a political conspiracy and an unprecedented threat.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美机侵南事包藏政治野心  铁托拒绝美方通牒  并向安理会控诉美国非法扣留船只\n\n1946-08-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美机侵南事包藏政治野心\n    铁托拒绝美方通牒\n    并向安理会控诉美国非法扣留船只\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】综合报导：美国当局日前采取一连串的威胁南斯拉夫人民共和国的行动。据八月十四日与八月二十日南致美国两次照会称：“七月十六日（按即第二次巴黎外长会议结束后第四日，在这次会议上，四外长曾接受法国关于意南边界的建议）以来，三十五天之内，美国飞机有组织的擅自侵入南国领空者达二百十六架。”八月九日下午一时，美“ＢＡ”四七号机又出现在南国乌布那机场一千英尺高空，被南国战斗机迫使着陆，讵二十一日夜间，亚泽逊即以最后通牒交南驻美代办马基多，以极其蛮横的措词要南国于接到后四十八小时之内释放八月九日被扣之美机人员，并以提请安理会“制裁”南国相恫吓。\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫已拒绝接受美国的最后通牒。贝尔格莱德电台于二十三日引证南斯拉夫人民共和国秘书处声明称：铁托元帅拒绝接受美国最后通牒，因八月九日侵入南国领空而被强迫降落之美飞行员，几与美方最后通牒交到贝尔格莱德拉时即已释放，且南国已允美国得来南国将其八月十九日第二架坠毁之飞机自行装修。铁托元帅于二十三日对伦敦每日电讯报驻南访员发表声明如下：“我认为美机故意破坏我国领空，系造成这样一种现象，即美国力量是如此的压倒优势，以致南国政府将被迫忍受一切事情。当整队飞机盘旋我国领空时，这是非常明显的事实。”铁托元帅于二十四日答复美联社记者时，亦斥责美国军用机有意侦察意在边界上的南国军事设备。铁托宣称：这种非法的在南国上空飞行，其目的之一为侦察我们驻军之防区和边界。\n    【新华社延安二十四日电】纽约讯：全国争取和平大会主席宣布：退伍的海军陆战队上校卡尔逊三日向报界发表声明称：美国致南最后通牒事，乃系摹仿对付希腊巴勒斯坦与外约旦的手法。武力的威胁竟被用以支持在巴黎和华盛顿发表的尖刻的言词，这些言词不仅命令第二次世界大战的战败国，而且命令战胜国服从英美的和平。\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】据悉：南国已于二十三日向安理会提出美国非法扣留南国船只事，联合国经济社会理事会副主席南国代表斯佛美尔于二十三日致函秘书长莱氏，要求安理会下次会议的议程，应包括美国非法扣留南国船只问题。上述船只共达一百七十一艘，多系一般邮船，被美当局占领德国时扣留在德奥美国领区内。同日美官方人士声称：如果南斯拉夫同意美国在和会上所提国际共管多瑙河计划，美将释放这些船只。对这一声明，贝尔格莱德“格拉斯”报称之为政治阴谋与空前的威胁。"

He occupied the county seat and nine other strongholds with a regiment of puppet troops. He was a notorious murderer. No less than three thousand anti-Japanese personnel and civilians died at his hands. After he killed Comrade Ma Yuting of the 19th Sub-district Public Security Supervision Office in Subao, he even cut out his heart and stir-fried it to eat. He was the most cannibalistic beast. Under his burning, killing, and looting, the people of eleven villages within five miles of the county seat all fled, turning the area into a \"no-man's land.\"\n　　When I and my unit arrived at Fengcun, we encountered an emaciated sixty-one-year-old woman carrying a white cloth bag, hurrying past me, constantly repeating, as if chanting a scripture, \"Truly a savior, truly a savior...\". Later, she turned back and told me that her old man had been forced by Zhang Conglong to run to the eastern mountains, and she, her widowed daughter-in-law, and the children had been so hungry at home that they had thought of suicide several times. Yan Xishan had ordered the formation of units, but because there was not a single man of eligible age in her family, all the land in her home was to be confiscated. Just then, the Eighth Route Army arrived. As she spoke, she patted the cloth bag on her back and said, \"The unit came at night, and I wanted to cook for you, but there was nothing. Today, I have to borrow some flour to make some food for you.\" These words moved me to tears. I calculated that she had already walked ten miles to borrow the flour.\n　　As soon as the unit stepped into the territory of Hongtong, everyone was extremely surprised. Because the usually steep mountain roads had been transformed into flat, wide avenues. Along the way, we saw that every village had prepared tea. The villagers of Jicun, Wangtou, Baicun, and Subi had even prepared watermelon and fruit. As we passed by, they swarmed over and stuffed the fruit into our hands. Our soldiers were all moved and said, \"How should we repay the people?\"\n　　The people made thirty cloud ladders and dozens of springboards for the troops, as well as fly swatters for pulling landmines. On the march, the villagers crowded on both sides shouting slogans such as \"Welcome the Eighth Route Army to liberate Hongtong City\" and \"The Eighth Route Army is the savior of the people of Hongtong!\" They wrote a letter to the troops saying, \"Whoever, whichever unit, captures or kills Zhang Conglong, we will specially reward them with ten fat pigs weighing over seventy catties each.\"\n　　The villagers themselves organized casualty transit stations. Because they were afraid of air raids, they had all the wounded stay in cave dwellings. Each cave dwelling housed five people, with someone to care for them, someone to cook, and someone to wash clothes. The children swatted flies, the women helped carry stretchers, and militiamen escorted them to ensure safety. ... There were four large battalions of militiamen automatically cooperating with the army in combat, as well as hundreds of stretcher teams. Originally, they did not have frontline rescue duties, but they automatically rushed to the front to rescue the wounded.\n　　Before the battle began, I saw a political commissar standing in the middle of the troops, loudly saying, \"We are the people's army. The people are so eager for us to eliminate the traitor Zhang Conglong, what else can we say...\".\n　　Our main force was in the east, and Zhang Conglong's puppet troops were also concentrated in the east city. We had to enter from the east gate, and the enemy was determined to defend the east gate. Under the cover of our intense artillery fire, the heroes of the grenade throwing team bravely stood on the edge of the outer moat, throwing grenades into the fortifications on the city. An enemy grenade exploded in our crowd, but more grenade throwers surged to the edge of the moat. The first ladder was erected on the east city wall, and the enemy threw large rocks from the city. The second ladder was immediately erected, and the enemy knocked it down with force. But the third ladder was finally erected on the left side of the east gate. The soldiers swarmed up the city wall. Many people were knocked down by poison gas, but even more people rushed up. A bullet swept one down, and someone immediately replaced him. Many people were injured, but none wanted to leave the front line. Dust covered the entire gate tower and bunker, and the shell broke the stone plaque on the gate. Zhang Conglong panicked and was writing orders at home, telling the troops on the city to retreat to Liujia Courtyard. But halfway through writing the order, the troops from the west gate rushed into the city. He hurriedly dropped the unfinished order and fled with his wife. But it was already too late, he had just escaped down the wall when he was killed. At dusk, the troops all entered the city. The ten major strongholds composed of more than a hundred bunkers were completely liberated by the people on August 16th.\n　　After the battle, the people of Hongtong, with boundless joy, presented the troops with two large banners, one reading: \"Savior of the People of Hongtong,\" and the other reading: \"Not to violate the people's property\".\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 群众性的战争\n苏茭\n1946-08-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　群众性的战争\n    苏茭\n    洪洞县是山西著名的棉、稻、小麦产地。抗战以前人民生活异常富裕，自阎锡山丢给敌人以后，八年间遭受很大的破坏。日本投降后，安泽汉奸县长张从龙不但没有得到惩办，反而被阎锡山更加重用，担任了洪洞的统委会长，后又兼县长。他带着一个团的伪军，盘踞着县城和其他九个据点。他是个有名的杀人魔王。死在他手下的抗日人员和群众不下三千人。他在苏堡将我十九分区公安督察处的马玉亭同志杀死后，把心也剜出炒着吃。他是最能吃人心的野兽。在他烧杀抢劫下，城关附近五里的十一个村庄人民都逃避一空，变成“无人区”。\n    我和队伍到冯村时，碰见了一个六十一岁骨瘦如柴的老太太，扛着一个白布口袋急急的从我身边走过，嘴里像念经一样，不断重复的喃喃说着：“真是救命恩人，真是救命恩人……………”。后来她翻回身来告诉我，她老汉被张从龙逼的跑到东山，她和寡妇媳妇小孩子在家里饿的几次想寻死。阎锡山叫编组，因为她家里没有一个合乎年龄的男人，家里地全要充公。正在这时候八路军来了。说着她拍着背上的布袋告我说：“夜黑了队伍来，我想给你们做饭吃，可是什也没什。今天我怎样也得借点面给你们做点饭吃。”这话使我感动的几乎哭出来，我算了算，她老人家为了借面，已走了十里地了。\n    队伍一踏上洪洞的境界，都异常惊讶起来。因为平日险峻的山路都变成了坦平的大道了。一路上看到每个村庄都预备了茶水在吉村、王头、柏村、苏壁的老乡们且预备了西瓜和水果。当我们经过时，他们就蜂拥地跑来，把水果塞进我们的手中。我们战士们都感动的说：“咱们该怎样报答老百姓呢？”\n    老百姓给部队做下了三十付云梯和几十付跳板，还有拉地雷的蝇子。在行军的路上，老乡们挤在两边呼口号“欢迎八路军解放洪洞城”、“八路军是洪洞人民的救星！”他们写了一封信给部队说：“不管那个人，那个单位，捉住或打死张从龙，我们特慰劳十口七十斤以上的肥猪。”\n    老乡们自己组织了伤兵转运站。因为怕飞机捣乱，他们让伤员全部住在窑洞里。每个窑洞五个人，有人照护，有人作饭，有人洗衣服。小孩们打蝇子，女人们帮着抬担架，还有民兵护送，保证安全。……他们自动配合军队作战的民兵有四个大营，还有几百付担架队。本来他们没有火线抢救任务，可是他们自动涌上火线抢救伤员。\n    在战斗开始以前，我看见一个政委站在队伍中间高声讲着：“我们是人民的军队，老百姓这样迫切地要求我们消灭汉奸张从龙，我们还有什么说………………”。\n    我们主力在东面，张从龙的伪军也都集中在东城。我们要从东门进去，敌人要死守东门。在我们猛烈的炮火掩护下，投弹组的英雄们，勇敢的站在外壕一边，把一个个手榴弹投在城上的工事里。敌人一颗手榴弹在我们人群中爆炸了，可是更多的投弹手涌到壕边。第一个梯子在东城墙上立起来了，敌人从城上投下大块石头。第二个梯子又马上立起来了，敌人又把他用力掀倒了。可是第三个梯子终于在东门左边立起来。战士们蜂拥似地冲上城墙。许多人被毒气冲倒了，更多的人又拥了上去。子弹扫倒了一个，马上就又有人补上。许多人挂了彩，但都不愿下火线。灰尘把整个的城门楼和碉堡都遮住了，炮弹把门上的石匾额都打破了。张从龙惊慌的在家里写着命令，叫城上的部队退守刘家院。可是命令写了一半，西门的队伍冲进城了。他慌忙丢下那半张命令，带着老婆逃走。可是已经晚了，他刚逃下墙。就被打死了。在暮色苍茫的时候，部队全进了城。由一百多碉堡构成的十个大据点，在八月十六日这一天完全为人民解放了。\n    洪洞人民在战后带着无限的喜悦，送给部队两面大旗，一面写着：“洪洞人民救星”：一面写着：“秋毫无犯”。"

Although our country has representatives attending the Peace Conference, the country they represent is now on the verge of a large-scale civil war. We firmly believe that democracy is the key to peace for China, just as it is for all regions of the world. Therefore, unless fascist forces can be eradicated from the root, and the democratic achievements gained in the war can be firmly established, there will be no guarantee of future peace.\" The letter pointed out: At present, the Peace Conference already has some signs of splitting into two opposing groups. This kind of situation that violates unity and democracy will only incite the revival of anti-democratic forces around the world and make the struggle for unification and democracy in China even more arduous. The letter stated: \"We firmly believe that world peace is indivisible, and therefore we must point out that the increasingly serious situation in China will affect the peace in the Far East. Only by restoring trust and cooperation among the Allied countries and promoting democracy and the people, can all nations ensure the fruits of victory and give the broad masses of people the opportunity to realize the happiness and progress they pursued during the difficult years of the anti-fascist war of aggression.\" The letter was signed by Ma Xulun, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Yan Baohang, Zhang Naiqi, Mao Dun, Liu Wang Liming, Wu Han, Shen Peilan, Bao Dasan, Hu Ziying, Lei Jieqiong, and others, totaling fifteen people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海人民团体代表  联名致函巴黎和会  中国已濒大规模内战之危境  不根绝法西斯则和平无保证\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海人民团体代表\n    联名致函巴黎和会\n    中国已濒大规模内战之危境\n    不根绝法西斯则和平无保证\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】沪市各界人民团体代表顷联名致函巴黎和会称：“吾人对于今日中国迄未成为统一与民主国家，甚表遗憾。吾国虽有代表出席和会，但彼等所代表之国家，现已濒于大规模内战之危境。吾人固知民主对于中国恰如对于世界一般地区同为和平之锁钥，故除非法西斯势力能从根铲除，而战争中所获得之民主成果，能确实树立，则未来之和平无有保证。”该函指出：目前和会已有若干分裂为两个对立集团之迹象，此种违反团结与民主之情形，只有鼓动全世界反民主力之复活，而使中国为统一与民主之斗争更形艰苦。该函称：“吾人确知世界和平之不可分割，因此必须提出：中国现状日益严重，将影响于远东之和平。惟有恢复同盟国家间之信任合作及推动民主与人民，各民族始克确保胜利之成果，而给予广大人民以机会，得以实现反法西斯侵略战争之苦难岁月中所追求之幸福与进步也。”署名该函者有马叙伦、沈钧儒、章伯钧、黄炎培、阎宝航、章乃器、茅盾、刘王立明、吴晗、沈佩兰、包达三、胡子婴、雷洁琼等十五人。"

Some soldiers said, \"This village won't work; it will take two hundred years of education to be like the old liberated areas.\" When the 2nd Detachment arrived at its station, the people did not approach them.\n\n    What could be done? Everyone knew that this was because they had been under the rule of the Kuomintang warlords for a long time and did not understand the Eighth Route Army. To achieve close unity between the army and the people, the only way was to start by improving relations with the masses. Therefore, the 1st Detachment held a military meeting, mobilizing all commanders and fighters to establish close relations with the masses. In the end, it was decided to help the masses with their work and not violate mass discipline, so that the people would be happy and satisfied. In addition to respecting the customs and habits of the masses, all commanders and fighters of the 4th and 6th Squads of the 2nd Detachment used the gaps in training to do work for the masses, and a widespread movement to help the masses with their work was launched. Cadres and soldiers of all companies competed to help the villagers carry water. An old man smiled and told everyone on the street, \"My tank has never been full, and now the Eighth Route Army comrades have filled it.\" They helped the villagers push the mill, build walls, and clean pigsties in the hot sun. The villagers all said in unison, \"Our own sons are not this good!\" They helped the villagers hoe the fields on Sundays. Four soldiers of the 4th Squad of the 2nd Detachment hoed two and a half mu of turnips for the landlord in half a day. The 5th Squad and 5th Team hoed more than ten mu of land for the landlord. Comrade Huang Yuyan used his nap time to dig a circle of manure for the landlord. In short, they did their best to help with everything the masses needed.\n\n    From their practical actions, the people's perception changed. And the people also recognized the essence of the people's army from their own experience. The masses sincerely said with gratitude, \"You Eighth Route Army are really like family to us. None of us have ever seen such a good army.\" At the same time, they also used practical actions to thank the Eighth Route Army. They bought watermelons, made vermicelli, steamed buns, sent cigarettes, and sent dumplings. When the soldiers were sick, the landlords sent water, noodles, and chicken eggs, taking care of the sick like their own children. The women took turns helping the army sew and wash clothes every day. On rainy days, when the army had no firewood to burn, the youth in the village automatically organized to collect firewood for the army. From then on, the relationship between the army and the people became closer and closer.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it led workers across the country in anti-Japanese work. After the Japanese surrender, it formulated 23 proposals for China's peace and democracy, workers' welfare, and China's industrial construction.

For the sake of national peace, democracy, unity, and industrialization, we joined the China Labor Association as a group member. The unified labor movement of Chinese workers, regardless of region, industry, or gender, united under this unified organization to work together, and it was welcomed and praised by the World Federation of Trade Unions. Only Chinese fascist, dictatorial, and war-mongering elements, in order to expand the civil war and maintain their enslavement and exploitation of workers for civil war capital, have intensified their sabotage of workers' unity and have harbored hatred and constant oppression of this organization, finally leading to the illegal and forced \"takeover\" action of the Chongqing \"Federation of Trade Unions\" on August 6th. This incident exposed the hideous face of the Chinese fascists. In their view, only their oppression of workers is \"legal.\" Everything else that is beneficial to workers is considered \"guilty\" and must be \"taken over.\" We believe that the unfortunate incident suffered by the Labor Association this time will arouse the indignation of workers and people of justice across the country and actively support the four demands put forward by the Labor Association: (1) Release the arrested personnel of the Association; (2) Investigate and deal with the instigators of this incident; (3) Demand that the government guarantee human rights, protect the safety of laborers, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future; (4) Demand that the occupiers immediately withdraw from the occupied institutions. Now, people from all walks of life generally believe that the Kuomintang government's so-called \"Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions'\" brutality is precisely to coordinate with the full-scale civil war and suppress workers. This behavior of the Kuomintang government will endanger other democrats and groups. Therefore, workers and peace-loving democrats across the country must unite more closely and fight for the realization of the four demands!\n\nXinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. Shanghai Dispatch: After the Chongqing Labor Association was forcibly occupied, Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Labor Association's General Council, in addition to receiving the Shanghai press on the 8th and appealing to all sectors of society, also issued a letter to trade union colleagues and workers on the 12th. The letter stated: \"The Labor Association is fighting to organize a strong and independent labor movement for Chinese workers to defend their human rights and social status. It has already sown the seeds of a genuine democratic movement and has been recognized and supported by trade unions around the world. But now we are encountering a crisis, the same crisis faced today by every democrat and liberal in China. The freedom movement is being destroyed, and liberal leaders are facing fears for their lives.\" Zhu stated in the letter: \"Who is the instigator of this attack? It is the person who has uttered his absurd lies, claiming that he will lead China into an era of democratic reform.\" The letter finally appealed: \"Workers, at this moment of life and death, I hope you will give your sympathy. For a just life, we demand justice, we ask you to take action!\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. Shanghai Dispatch: After the Labor Association incident, letters of condolence from people from all walks of life continued to pour in like snowflakes. Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao, Xiong Foxi, and 63 other people from the cultural circles jointly expressed their condolences on the 16th. More than 20 units of trade unions, such as China Textile, Tongyi, Shenxin, and Yongsheng in the textile industry, and condolence letters from trade unions of hydropower, postal service bureaus, and others, came in one after another. The Chengdu trade unions of various industries also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Justice, the Central Organization Department of the Kuomintang, and other relevant agencies and organizations of the Kuomintang government regarding the Labor Association case, calling for the protection of labor organizations and the punishment of illegal occupiers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. Shanghai Dispatch: On the 12th, the General Council of the Labor Association published in the newspapers here a \"Call to the Society Regarding the Forcible Occupation of Affiliated Institutions in Chongqing.\" After detailing the beginning and end of the Labor Association case and refuting the slanders against the Labor Association, the document stated: \"The Association expresses its infinite grief and indignation at this illegal incident! In order to safeguard national dignity, to fight for the freedom of worker organizations, to protect the rights of the people, and for the sake of justice and righteousness, we put forward the following demands: (1) Immediately release the arrested service personnel of the Association; (2) Immediately return all the affiliated institutions of the Association that have been forcibly occupied; (3) Thoroughly investigate and severely punish this illegal incident and its instigators; (4) Request the government to protect the safety of the staff of the Association in accordance with the law and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. Finally, the Association requests the society to pay attention to this illegal incident, accept our appeal, and give us righteous assistance!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刘宁一氏为渝劳协案发表谈话  当局破坏工运乃配合全面内战  国人应力争实现劳协四项要求  朱学范氏吁请全国工人以行动支援\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刘宁一氏为渝劳协案发表谈话\n    当局破坏工运乃配合全面内战\n    国人应力争实现劳协四项要求\n    朱学范氏吁请全国工人以行动支援\n    【新华社南京二十六日电】沪讯：八、六渝劳协案发生后，中国解放区工联筹备会负责人，世界职工会联合会候补理事刘宁一氏，在此间对记者发表谈话如下：\n    中国劳动协会是中国工人全国性的统一组织，它在抗战时期即领导全国工人从事抗战工作，日寇投降之后，它又为了中国的和平民主、工人的福利和中国的工业建设制订了二十三条主张，它在重庆设办事处及工人福利社、劳协医院、工人学校、托儿所等。我们解放区有八十八万职工（按：现已有一百五十万），为了国家的和平民主团结和工业化的大计，以团体会员资格参加了中国劳动协会，中国工人的统一运动，从此不分地区、不分产业、不分男女，在这一统一的组织下面团结起来共同努力，并得到了世界职工会联合会的欢迎与赞扬。只有中国法西斯独裁好战分子，为了扩大内战，为了维持他们对工人的奴役与榨取内战资本，才加紧破坏工人的团结，才对于这一组织加以仇视和不断的压迫，终于发生了八月六日重庆“总工会”的非法强迫“接收”行动。这一事件，暴露了中国法西斯分子的狰狞面目。在他们看来，只有他们的压迫工人是“合法”的，此外一切对工人有利的事业，都认为“有罪”，都要“接收”。我们相信此次劳协所遭的不幸事件，将会引起全国工人和正义人士的愤慨，而积极支持劳协所提出的四项要求：（一）释放该会被捕人员；（二）查办此次事件主使人；（三）要求政府保障人权，保障劳工的安全，保证今后不再发生同类事件；（四）要求强占者即行退出被占机构。现在社会人士普遍的认为国民党政府的所谓“渝市总工会”的暴行，正是为了配合全面内战，进行对工人镇压。国民党政府这种行为，将危及其他的民主人士与团体，因此全国工人、全国和平民主人士更不能不紧紧团结，为实现四项要求而斗争！\n    【新华社南京二十六日电】沪讯：渝劳协被强占后，劳协总会理事长朱学范氏除于八日招待上海新闻界，向各界呼吁外，并于十二日发表致工会同人暨工友函，该函中称：“劳协为中国工人组织一个强大独立之劳工运动，以保卫其人权及社会地位而奋斗，它已经播下一种真正民主运动的种子，并得到各国工会的承认和支持。而现在我们遭遇了一个危机，和中国每一民主人士及自由主义人士今天所遭遇的危机一样，自由运动被破坏了，自由主义的领袖受到生命的恐惧。”朱氏在函中称：“此种攻击之主使者为谁？其人即系曾经发表其荒诞之谎言，谓将使中国走入一民主改良之时代者也。”该函最后呼吁：“工友们在此生死存亡之际，我希望你们给予同情，为了正当之生活，我们要求正义，我们请求你们行动！”\n    【新华社南京二十六日电】沪讯：劳协事件发生后，各界人士慰问劳协函件，续如雪片飞来。文化界郭沫若、茅盾、叶圣陶、熊佛西等六十七人，十六日联名慰问。纺织业中纺、统益、申新、永生等工会二十余单位，水电、邮政局等工会的慰问函，纷至沓来。成都各业工会顷亦以劳协案通电国民党政府行政院、司法部、国民党中央组织部及其他有关机关团体，呼吁保障劳工组织，惩办非法强占人员。\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】沪讯：十二日劳协总会在此间报章发表“为重庆附属机构被武力强占事向社会呼吁书”，该件在详述劳协案始末，驳斥对于劳协的诬蔑之后称：“本会对此非法事件表示无限沉痛与愤慨！为了维护国家的尊严，为了争取工人组织的自由，为了维护人民的权利，为了公理与正义，我们提出下列的要求：（一）立即释放本会被捕服务人员；（二）立即退还本会被强占的各附属机构；（三）彻查严惩此次不法事件及其主使者；（四）请政府依法保障本会工作人员之安全，并保证今后不再发生同样之事件。最后，本会要求社会重视此非法事件，接受我们的呼吁，并给我们正义的援助！”"

    "content": "Another Ironclad Proof!\n    Yan Xishan Retains Japanese Bandits\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 24th] The nine captured Japanese officers and soldiers of the enemy who were captured by the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army in the counter-attack self-defense battles in Guoxian and Yuanping in northern Shanxi have arrived here. The ironclad fact has completely shattered Yan Xishan's lie that \"there are no Japanese troops in Shanxi.\" These nine people originally belonged to the enemy's Independent Third Mixed Brigade. Now they have been renamed and promoted by Yan Xishan and retained in a certain unit. For example, Kinji Saburo, the former lieutenant deputy of the artillery squadron of the enemy's Independent Third Mixed Brigade, has now changed his name to Yin Weiman and nominally serves as the deputy director of the military supply department of the 2nd Security Brigade of Yan's army, but is actually the major commander of the team. In addition, Kiyonaga Tazawa, Nobuyuki Kawada, Saburo Matsumoto, and Mibō Matsumoto all serve as instructors in the team. According to Kiyonaga Tazawa, \"The training content includes rifle, machine gun, and grenade launcher shooting, bayonet fighting techniques, fortifications, as well as tactics for attacking the Eighth Route Army and other subjects.\" According to Nagai Mahide, an enemy soldier who was incorporated into the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the 40th Division of Yan's army as a heavy machine gun shooter, they were never disarmed until they were disarmed by the Eighth Route Army this time. In order to expand the civil war, Yan Xishan adopted various means to retain Japanese troops, in addition to promotion and reuse, and marrying Chinese wives for Japanese soldiers. Motada Yukio married Jie Cuihua, a 17-year-old from Dai County this year. Sato Yushio, a Japanese soldier who was a sergeant in the communications company of the 2nd Regiment of the 40th Division of Yan's army, married Jin Lian from Sairi Village in Dai County. Nagai Mahide also confessed: \"Until I was captured on July 11, I did not know that Japan had surrendered, I only knew that there was a temporary truce.\" This is because Yan Xishan has been deceiving and concealing them for a long time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 又一铁证！  阎锡山留用日寇\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　又一铁证！\n    阎锡山留用日寇\n    【新华社兴县二十四日电】晋绥八路军在晋北崞县、原平等地反击自卫战中俘护之九名日军官兵已抵达此间，铁的事实已完全粉碎了阎锡山“山西已无日军”的谎话。彼等九人原属敌独立第三混成旅团，今被阎锡山易名晋级留用于某部队中，如原任敌独立第三混成旅团炮兵中队少尉队副近自三郎，今已改名为尹维满，名义上任阎军保安第二大队军需处副处长，实为该队之少校指挥官。又加龙泽静男、川田延以、松本三郎、松本昧芳等均任该队教官。据龙泽静男称：“教练内容除步枪、机枪、掷弹筒射击等、白刃战动作，筑城学外，并有袭击八路军战术等科目”。又据被编入阎军十九军四十师二团三营充任重机枪射手之敌军永井真秀称：他们始终未被缴收过武器，直至此次始被八路军解除武装。阎锡山为了扩大内战竟采用种种手段留用日军，除晋级重用外，并为日本士兵娶中国妻子。茂田之雄今年娶了代县城内十七岁的解翠花为妻，在阎军十九军四十师二团通讯连担任上士之日军佐藤之男曾娶代县塞里村之金莲为妻，永井真秀又供称：“直至七月十一日被俘前，尚不知日本投降，只知为暂时休战”。这是因为阎锡山长期欺骗蒙蔽着他们。"

    "content": "Meng County Self-Defense Battle\n    ——The Mighty Power of the Fourth and Fifth Regimental Artillery\n    Yan Xin\n    On the way to departure, the artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments, upon hearing that they would be cooperating with the 304th Regiment, said one after another, \"We must fight well and win glory for our Fourth and Fifth Regiments.\"\n\n    On the night of the 4th, the attack on Yezhucun, held by the 51st Regiment of the stubborn enemy, an elite regiment of the 17th Brigade, the mission of the Fourth and Fifth Regimental Artillery Company was to cooperate with the 304th Regiment in attacking the most vicious battalion that had been robbing the common people. The soldiers were all eager to fight, saying, \"Damn it, you've occupied our territory for six and a half months and attacked us countless times. Today, we'll give it back to you!\"\n\n    Before dawn, the troops approached the east end of the village. Under the dense fire of bullets, the artillerymen fearlessly pushed the cannons to the place closest to the enemy's blockhouse. The enemy's blockhouse was more than two zhang high, and even the sheer earthen cliff was four zhang high. The two blockhouses were fifty or sixty meters apart, with an open space in front, and the blockhouses were sealed off layer by layer. Light and heavy machine guns on the blockhouses weaved a fire net in all directions.\n\n    The artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments set up their cannons in the fire net. The first shell landed squarely on top of the blockhouse, and cheers erupted on the front line. The enemy's machine guns frantically concentrated their fire, sparks flying in front of them, but the artillerymen seemed not to see it. With successive booming shots, the blockhouse burst open, and the enemy's machine guns went silent. Amidst the unanimous cheers of the infantry, a sharp charge bugle sounded, and the enemy rolled down from the blockhouse like rats, then burrowed into the outer trenches to resist stubbornly, throwing grenades one after another, but they couldn't stop the heroes of the 304th Regiment. In the blink of an eye, they had rushed to the edge of the outer trench... The enemy's first line of blockhouses was thus disintegrated.\n\n    The sky was already bright, and the advance continued step by step. The artillery of the Fifth Regiment was the pioneer, and also the signal of victory. Every blockhouse, without a few shells, had its bricks and tiles flying and a skylight opened. In a series of seven or eight blockhouse lines, not a single blockhouse escaped the punishment of the shells.\n\n    Comrade Jiang Tianrun, the squad leader of the fourth artillery squad, performed excellently in the attack that day.\n\n    Although the enemy launched counterattacks, they were beaten into a disarray by the soldiers of the 304th Regiment, and the remaining ones fled to the final position of their regimental headquarters.\n\n    The regimental headquarters was located in the Taishan Temple in Qianliren Village to the west, surrounded by 300 meters of open space, layered fortifications, small blockhouses in front and behind, and a large blockhouse standing in the courtyard. The machine gun and artillery company of the regimental headquarters alone had six heavy machine guns and five cannons. Concentrated here were three battalions of the 51st Regiment, a stubborn component, the regimental direct unit, one battalion of the 49th Regiment, and one company of the 55th Brigade.\n\n    Out of consideration for the unnecessary sacrifices of the stubborn enemy soldiers, it was decided that an appeal would be made that night, hoping to peacefully persuade them to lay down their weapons. Before the appeal, our artillery first blasted a hole in the large blockhouse to let them know that there was no safe place to defend.\n\n    However, the special agents of the stubborn enemy controlled their soldiers, and the appeal failed. The general attack began on the 6th. Comrade Chen Zhenglie, the artillery platoon leader (artillery hero), and Comrade Jiang Shengjun, the second squad leader, showed great prowess, accurately dropping every shell on the enemy's blockhouses. At this time, the artillery of the 301st Regiment also concentrated and bombarded together. Although the enemy also retaliated fiercely, they could not reverse their doom. In an instant, half of the blockhouse had collapsed. Suddenly, an enemy shell exploded near our gun emplacement, and platoon leader Chen Zhenglie was wounded, and second squad leader Jiang Shengjun also bled from his ears from the shock, but they did not relax their firing.\n\n    The enemy's blockhouse went silent. Our infantry launched a charge, and an enemy company commander led seventy or eighty men to surrender first. Then, the infantry rushed into the temple courtyard.\n\n    The temple courtyard was filled with dead and wounded. Lightly wounded by artillery shells were fifty or sixty, and more than a hundred were killed. The enemy regimental commander led soldiers to charge out at the risk of their lives, but in the end, they obediently laid down their weapons, and more than 500 officers and soldiers were all eliminated. By this time, it was noon.\n\n    After the battle, the × regimental commander of the 304th Regiment said to the artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments with a satisfied smile, \"You guys shot very accurately.\"\n\n    When we returned, our soldiers' grenade pouches were full of American bombs.\n\n    They said, \"We should cherish the honor of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments and win glory for the Fourth and Fifth Regiments!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孟县自卫战——四五部炮兵大显神威\n雁心\n1946-08-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孟县自卫战\n    ——四五部炮兵大显神威\n    雁心\n    四五部队的炮兵在出发途中，提到是和三○四部配合作战，大家便纷纷的说：“去了一定得打好，要给咱们四五部队争光。”\n    四日晚，围攻冶戍村顽五十一团，这是十七旅的精锐团，四五部队炮兵连的任务是配合三○四部打那抢劫老百姓最凶恶的一营，战士们都磨拳擦掌的说：“妈的，你们占我们地方六个半月了，进攻我们不知多少次了，今天还你一下试试！”\n    拂晓前，部队接近了村东头，在子弹扑扑的密射下，炮兵们毫不畏怯的把炮推到离敌人碉堡最近的地方。敌人的碉堡有二丈多高，连削立的土崖就有四丈高，两碉堡相距五六十米，正面一片开阔地，而碉堡周围却层层封锁，碉堡上轻重机枪把四面八方织成火网。\n    四五部的炮兵就在火网中架起了炮，第一发炮弹就不偏不移的落在碉堡顶上，战线上掀起了喝采声。敌人机枪着急地集中打过来，面前火星乱跳，但是炮兵们好象没有看见似的，接连着轰轰几炮，碉堡开了花，敌人的机枪哑了。在步兵们一致的喝采声中，吹起了尖厉的冲锋号，敌人象老鼠一般从碉堡上滚下来，又钻到外壕里顽抗，手榴弹接二连三的抛掷着，但挡不住三○四部队的英雄。一转眼，他们已冲到外壕边，…………敌人的第一线碉堡就此瓦解。\n    天已大亮，接着逐步推进，五四部的炮是开路先锋，也是胜利的信号。每一座碉堡不消几发炮弹便砖飞瓦裂开了天窗，一连七八道碉堡线，没有一个碉堡逃出了炮弹的惩罚。\n    在这一天进攻中炮兵四班长姜天润同志顶呱呱。\n    敌人虽然进行反扑，都被三○四部战士们打得东倒西歪，剩下的逃到他们团部的最后阵地去。\n    团部在西面前里仁村的泰山庙内，周围三百米都是开阔地，层层工事，前后小碉堡，院中矗立一座大碉堡，光团部机炮连就有六挺重机枪，五门炮。集中在这的有五十一团三个营的顽强部分，团直属队、四十九团一个营和五十五旅一个连。\n    为了顾念顽军士兵无谓的牺牲，当晚决定先进行喊话，希望能做到和平的争取他们放下武器。在喊话前我们的炮兵先照着大碉堡轰个窟窿，让他们知道已无险可守。\n    可是顽军特务们控制着他们的兵士，喊话失效了，六日开始总攻。炮兵一排长陈正烈同志（炮兵英雄）和二班长蒋胜军同志大显威风，把每一颗炮弹准确地落在敌人碉堡上。这时，三○一部队的炮也集中过来，一齐轰击着，敌人虽然也猛烈的还击，但已挽不回厄运。顷刻间碉堡已塌了一半。忽然敌人一个炮弹在我们炮座附近炸开，排长陈正烈挂了彩，二班长蒋胜军也震得耳内出血，但他们并不放松射击。\n    敌人的碉堡哑了。我们的步兵发起了冲锋，敌人一个连长带着七八十人先投过来，接着，步兵冲进大庙院。\n    庙院内死伤枕籍，光炮弹炸伤的就有五六十个，死的有一百多，敌团长带士兵冒死冲出来，最后还是乖乖的放下武器，五百余官兵全被解决，这时天才交午。\n    战后，三○四部×团长便带着满意的笑容对四五部的炮兵们讲：“你们打得真准。”\n    回来时我们战士的手榴弹袋满满的装着美国炸弹。\n    他们说：“我们应当爱护四五部的荣誉，为四五部队争光！”"

    "content": "Launch a Struggle Against Counterfeit Currency\n    Yang Jianzhong\n    In the past two months, many counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in various parts of the border region, including Jichaopiao (冀钞) red 500 yuan notes, blue 500 yuan notes, red 100 yuan notes, brown 100 yuan notes, red 50 yuan notes, green 10 yuan notes, Pingyuan edition blue 100 yuan notes, Jichaopiao bank draft green 500 yuan notes, Taiyue Economic Bureau commercial circulation notes blue 50 yuan notes, Luxi Bank blue 100 yuan notes, red 100 yuan notes, and more than 20 other types. Furthermore, according to reliable information: the Kuomintang special agents in Shijiazhuang are rushing to print 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan notes. This is a vicious plot by the Kuomintang reactionaries to systematically sabotage our border region's financial system. Based on the materials we have obtained, the Kuomintang's counterfeit banknote manufacturing areas include Anyang, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Xinxiang. In Tianjin, the ×× Association directly leads this work. In Anyang, there are two places manufacturing counterfeit banknotes: one is in Cuiqiao (more than ten li from Anyang City), led by a certain regimental commander of Wang Ziquan's puppet army; the other is in Anyang City. The counterfeit banknotes coming from Anyang have been found with five letter prefixes: A, B, C, D, and E. It is estimated that the amount issued is quite large, and most of them are 500 yuan notes. From this, it appears that Anyang is the Kuomintang's major base for manufacturing counterfeit banknotes.\n\n    The Kuomintang's counterfeit banknote printing factories are relatively secret, but the promotion of counterfeit banknotes to the Liberated Areas is carried out openly. The following methods of promotion have been discovered:\n\n    (1) Openly selling them in cities and towns. Economic special agents, carrying a bag of counterfeit banknotes, hawk them along the streets. The price is one yuan of legal tender for three yuan of counterfeit banknotes, or one yuan of genuine Jichaopiao for seven yuan of counterfeit Jichaopiao.\n\n    (2) Wang Ziquan's puppet army in Anyang uses counterfeit banknotes to pay military salaries, 30,000 yuan per person per month, which are then used in our border areas by plainclothes teams.\n\n    (3) Taking advantage of traitorous merchants who use counterfeit banknotes to purchase materials in the Liberated Areas, such as grain, cotton, and homespun cloth, regardless of price, buying as much as they can and whatever they find. Merchants only pay a small amount of paper money for expenses, one yuan of legal tender buying five counterfeit banknotes (regardless of the face value). After purchasing the materials, the profits are split evenly between both parties.\n\n    (4) Economic special agents use social connections to entrust people going to the Liberated Areas to bring counterfeit banknotes directly to our region for promotion.\n\n    (5) Forced exchange. When merchants and ordinary people from Tianjin go to the Liberated Areas, they are forced to exchange any legal tender they carry for counterfeit banknotes at Kuomintang checkpoints. They even pretend to be compassionate, saying: \"The Communist Party area does not use legal tender. To prevent you from suffering losses, exchange your legal tender for Jichaopiao to take with you!\"\n\n    (6) A small number of traitorous merchants in the Liberated Areas, in order to get rich, voluntarily go to Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other places to traffic in counterfeit banknotes.\n\n    (7) Counterfeit banknotes are brought from Kuomintang areas to the Liberated Areas, and in order to evade our inspection, they adopt despicable and shameless methods: First, they use women. In Jingxian, two beautifully dressed women were caught with more than a dozen small pockets around their shirts and underpants filled with counterfeit banknotes. If calculated with 100 yuan notes, one person can carry 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. This kind of carrying does not reveal its true form from the outside. Second, merchants conceal them in the goods they transport, for example, by digging a hole in the middle of a roll of paper to hide the counterfeit banknotes. Third, boatmen carry them.\n\n    The Kuomintang's conspiracy to manufacture counterfeit banknotes is vicious and despicable. On the one hand, they attempt to undermine the credibility of Jichaopiao, create market chaos, and cause inflation in our area. On the other hand, they use counterfeit banknotes to solve some of their economic difficulties, such as seizing materials and paying military salaries. The Kuomintang's conspiracy to manufacture counterfeit banknotes is planned and large-scale, unlike the Japanese imperialists' surreptitious counterfeiting during the War of Resistance. It should arouse serious attention and vigilance from all the people in the border region.\n\n    After counterfeit banknotes were widely discovered in various parts of the border region in early June, our efforts have quelled the flames, but they have already caused us considerable harm. First of all, some merchants, farmers, and government troops mistakenly received counterfeit banknotes and suffered losses. For example, a store in Linzhang sold 200,000 yuan worth of goods, and 190,000 yuan were counterfeit. A small merchant in Handan who relied on selling cotton to support his family once sold 47,000 yuan worth of goods, and 40,000 yuan were counterfeit.\n\n    The intrusion of counterfeit banknotes has made people in some areas doubt the Jichaopiao. For example, after a large number of 500 yuan counterfeit notes were discovered in Linzhang, there was a short period when people were unwilling to use 500 yuan notes, fearing losses. One merchant said: \"Jichaopiao is good, but there are too many counterfeits.\" This sentence is worthy of our attention.\n\n    The struggle against counterfeit banknotes must flexibly apply two principles: first, mobilize the masses; second, banks, party, government, military, and people must closely cooperate to carry it out together. The specific methods adopted by various regions this year include the following:\n\n    (1) Governments at all levels convened special meetings to discuss and arrange the matter.\n\n    (2) The bank that first discovered the counterfeit banknotes (mostly in the border areas) notified other banks in other regions by telephone or special messenger. The banks then printed and distributed methods for identifying counterfeit banknotes, attracting everyone's attention.\n\n    (3) The banks and the government cooperated to conduct extensive publicity, holding forums with merchants, holding rallies at fairs, exposing the Kuomintang's conspiracy to manufacture counterfeit banknotes, and telling everyone the differences between counterfeit and genuine banknotes. Village cadres regularly talked to the people about the counterfeit banknote problem at mass meetings.\n\n    (4) Bank cadres regularly patrolled the market towns, and if counterfeit banknotes were discovered, they immediately gathered the people around and explained the situation to everyone. This method was very effective.\n\n    (5) Banks universally established counterfeit banknote identification centers (represented by exchange offices or cooperatives) to facilitate the public in identifying genuine and counterfeit banknotes.\n\n    (6) Militiamen and anti-smuggling personnel in the border areas conducted strict inspections to prevent counterfeit banknotes from entering the Liberated Areas.\n\n    (7) Banks and public security organs cooperated to investigate and crack down on counterfeit banknote criminals. This is a very important task.\n\n    Various regions have successively cracked down on more than a dozen major counterfeit banknote criminals, some involving 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and others involving 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Generally, a fine of one to three times the amount of the counterfeit money is imposed. The purpose of the fine is mainly to allow them to exchange the money in a short period and compensate those who mistakenly received counterfeit banknotes. For those with serious circumstances, the government will punish them according to law. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses in detecting counterfeit banknotes, a reward of 5% to 10% is stipulated.\n\n    The struggle against counterfeit banknotes is an important part of the economic struggle against the stubborn elements. It is a long-term, arduous, and mass-based undertaking. The Kuomintang is constantly manufacturing counterfeit banknotes to sabotage us, and a slight oversight can lead to great losses. Therefore, we must always pay attention and be vigilant at all times. After this struggle, the people have become smarter. Whenever they are not sure about a banknote, they first take it to the bank or counterfeit banknote identification center to inquire and distinguish between genuine and counterfeit. This gives the counterfeit banknote promoters a severe blow. I believe that with the joint efforts of all the people in the border region, we have the strength to shatter the Kuomintang's counterfeit banknote conspiracy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开展反假票斗争\n杨建中\n1946-08-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　开展反假票斗争\n    杨建中\n    最近两个月来，边区各地发现假票很多，有冀钞红色五百元券，蓝色五百元券，红色百元券，褐色百元券，红色五十元券，绿色十元券，平原版蓝色百元券，冀钞本票绿色五百元券，太岳经济局商业流通卷蓝色五十元券，鲁西银行蓝色百元券，红色百元券等二十余种。又据确息：石家庄国特正赶印千元券五百元券，这是国民党反动派有计划地破坏我边区金融的毒辣阴谋。根据我们得到的材料来看，国民党制造假票的地区有安阳，石家庄、天津、开封、太原、新乡等地。天津由××会直接领导这个工作，安阳有两个地方制造假票；一在崔桥（离安阳城十余里）由安阳伪军王自全部某团长领导，一在安阳城内。从安阳来的假票，已发现者有ＡＢＣＤＥ五个字头，估计发行额相当大，并且大部分是五百元券，由此看来安阳是国民党制造假票的大本营。\n    国民党的假票印刷厂较为秘密，但是往解放区推销假票却是公开进行，据已发现的有下列几种推行方法：\n    （一）在城内和市镇上公开出卖，经济特务拿着一布袋假票沿街叫卖，价格是一元法币买三元假票，一元真冀钞买七元假冀钞。\n    （二）安阳伪军王自全部用假票发军饷，每人每月三万元，通过便衣队到我边沿区使用。\n    （三）利用奸商拿假票到解放区购物资，如粮食棉花土布等，不论价格贵贱，要多少出多少，见什么就买什么，商人只付给少数纸消费，一块法币买五张假票（不管票面额大小），买到物资后，利益双方均分。\n    （四）经济特务利用社会关系，委托到解放区的人，带假票直接来我区推行。\n    （五）强迫兑换，从天津到解放区来的商人和老百姓，经过国民党检查哨时，凡带有关金法币的强迫兑成假票。并且假慈悲地说：“共产党地区不使用法币，为了不让你吃亏，你把法币换成冀钞带去吧！”\n    （六）解放区有少数奸商，为了发财自动去天津石家庄等地贩回假票。\n    （七）假票由国民党地区带到解放区，为了逃避我们检查，采用卑鄙无耻的办法：第一利用妇女，景县查获两个妇女装饰很漂亮，衬衣和衬裤周围，有十几个小口袋装假票。若以一百元券计算，一个人可带二三十万元，这样携带从外表来看是不露原形的。第二商人贩运杂货中夹带，例如将一领纸中间挖一个洞装假票。第三船夫携带。\n    国民党制造假票的阴谋是毒辣而卑鄙的，一方面企图破坏冀钞威信，造成我市场混乱通货膨胀，另一方面利用假票解决其部份经济困难，如抢购物资发军饷等。国民党制造假票的阴谋，是有计划的大规模的，和抗战时期日本帝国主义偷偷摸摸搞假票不同。应引起全边区人民严重的注意和警惕。\n    六月初边区各地普遍发现假票后，经过大家努力，凶焰虽已扑灭，但已带给我们不少危害。首先是有些商人农民和机关部队误收假票遭受了损失。例如临漳一个商店卖了二十万元，有十九万是假票，邯郸有一个小商人靠卖棉花养家度日，有一次卖了四万七千元，竟有四万元是假票。\n    假票侵入使某些地区人民对冀钞发生怀疑。例如临漳发现大批五百元券假票后，曾有一个短时期，老百姓不愿使用五百元券，害怕吃亏。有一个商人说：“冀钞好是好，只是假的太多”。这句话是值得我们注意的。\n    反假票斗争必须灵活运用两个原则：第一发动群众，第二银行和党政军民密切配合共同进行。今年各地采用的具体办法有下列几种：\n    （一）各级政府召开专门会议讨论布置。\n    （二）首先发现假票的银行（大多在边境区）用电话或专人送信通知其他地区的银行，由银行印制假票识别办法张贴送发，引起大家注意。\n    （三）银行和政府配合广泛进行宣传，召开商人座谈会，逢集召开大会，揭发国民党制造假票的阴谋，将假票和真票的区别告诉大家，村干部在群众会议上，经常向老百姓讲假票问题。\n    （四）银行派干部经常在集镇上巡视，如果发现了假票，立即把周围的人聚拢在一起向大家讲，这个办法效力较大。\n    （五）银行普遍设立假票识别所（由兑换所或合作社代理）便利群众认清真假票。\n    （六）边沿地区的民兵和缉私人员，进行严格检查，杜绝假票进入解放区。\n    （七）银行和公安机关配合，设法侦察破获假票犯，这是很重要的工作。\n    各地已先后破获大宗假票犯十余起，多的有二三十万元，少的亦四五万元，一般是处以一倍至三倍的罚金，罚金的用途，主要是让他自己短期兑换，赔偿误收假票者的损失，情节严重者，政府依法制裁。为了鼓励群众查获假票的积极性，规定百分之五至百分之十的奖金。\n    反假票斗争是对顽经济斗争中一项重要工作，它是长期的，艰苦的群众性的，国民党时时刻刻在制造假票破坏我们，稍一不慎就遭受很大损失，因此我们要经常注意随时警惕。经过这次斗争后，现在老百姓已经学得聪明了，凡是自己认不清楚的票子，先拿到银行或假票识别所去询问，以辨真假，这给假票推销者一个严重打击。相信在全边区人民共同努力之下，我们是有力量把国民党的假票阴谋粉碎的。"

The telephone lines between Wenxi and Shuitou, and between Shuitou and Xiaxian, have never been kept intact for even half a day by Chiang's army, being repeatedly erected and destroyed (causing the Chiang army's headquarters to be unable to command effectively, their steps to be chaotic, and them to be startled several times a night). The Chiang army officers and soldiers stationed in villages and towns such as Yanzhang, Shangxia Fengcun, Huzhang, and Weiguo (are extremely terrified of the elusive mass guerrilla teams). They are harassed more than once every night and cannot sleep peacefully. During the day, they are hungry and dare not venture out in groups of thirty to plunder. Two cooks from the 27th Brigade (formerly the 27th Division) stationed in Guoniu Village were captured by the guerrillas when they went to the village entrance to fetch water. Chiang's army-appointed village chiefs and assistant members (all former traitors and local tyrants) in villages such as Yuwangcheng and Sima in Xiaxian were captured by the guerrilla militia as soon as they \"took office\". Currently, in the Jinan triangular area within the grid network, various mass guerrilla groups are launching a large-scale competition to sabotage and capture prisoners, echoing the frontal self-defense counter-attack.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋南人民打击蒋军疯狂进攻  格子网内展开游击战  冀鲁豫日报号召全区紧急自卫\n\n1946-08-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋南人民打击蒋军疯狂进攻\n    格子网内展开游击战\n    冀鲁豫日报号召全区紧急自卫\n    【同蒲前线二十四日电】回答蒋军之疯狂进犯，晋南闻喜、夏县蒋占区广大群众，在蒋军据点林立的格子网里爆发了如火如荼的群众性的游击战争。闻喜至水头，水头至夏县之间的电话线，蒋军从来没有架好过半天，屡架屡破坏（致使蒋军首脑机关指挥不灵，步调错乱，一夜数惊）。占驻堰掌、上下冯村、胡张、慰郭等村镇蒋军官兵，（对神出鬼没之群众游击队，异常恐怖）他们每夜必遭一次以上之袭扰，不能安眠，白天饿着肚子，还不敢三十人一股出发抢掠。驻在郭牛村二十七旅（原二十七师）的两个伙夫，到村口挑水，就被游击队捉走了。夏县禹王城、司马等村蒋军所委任的编村村长协助员（都是过去的汉奸恶霸）等，刚一“上任”，即被游击队民兵捉走了。现在在格子网里的晋南三角地带，各个群众游击集团，正展开了一个大规模的破袭捕捉俘虏竞赛运动，与正面的自卫反击战互相呼应。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: Washington dispatch: Following the release of the Marshall-Stuart statement, Democratic Congressman Patterson delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, stating: \"Special Envoy Marshall, in order to contribute to both China and the United States in completing his mission, has no alternative but to publicly acknowledge failure and return home immediately. All military and economic aid to the Chinese government should cease, and the Chinese government should be told that the United States will no longer aid the Chinese government if it does not implement the principles of Truman's China policy of December 15th last year.\" Patterson continued, \"None of Chiang Kai-shek's four promises at the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) nor the resolutions of the PCC have been implemented, and the current situation is deteriorating.\" After criticizing the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session's conspiracy to overturn the PCC resolutions, Patterson pointed out, \"This kind of behavior that hinders the implementation of unified democracy and the cessation of civil war in China is clearly encouraged by the United States government.\" Patterson cited the fact that Marshall came to Washington during the Kuomintang Second Plenary Session to negotiate a $500 million loan to the Chinese government in order to expand U.S. aid to the Kuomintang during this period as evidence. Patterson forcefully stated, \"All of this is a kind of encouragement, which is enough to prove that U.S. foreign policy has strong anti-democratic and imperialistic colors.\" Patterson concluded by emphasizing, \"We can assert that the hope for Marshall's success will unfortunately become a bubble. The current government of China is still a one-party dictatorship. The peaceful unification and realization of democracy in China have not only failed to make progress, but have been hindered by Marshall's presence in China. We must ask ourselves who should be held responsible for Marshall's failure to complete his mission. I firmly believe that the evil forces in China and the United States have shamelessly used Marshall to achieve their selfish desires, resulting in harm to China's democracy, U.S. security, and world peace. The fact is very clear that Marshall has no hope of success. The time has come for us to notify the Chinese government that it will not be able to obtain any further assistance from the United States unless it changes its nature in accordance with Truman's China policy declaration. Recalling Marshall, withdrawing U.S. troops from China, and cutting off all military and economic aid to China will enable the Chinese government to change its intention to wage civil war.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 柏德逊氏在众院演说  痛斥美国对华错误政策  主张马歇尔返国停止援蒋\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　柏德逊氏在众院演说\n    痛斥美国对华错误政策\n    主张马歇尔返国停止援蒋\n    【新华社延安廿六日电】华盛顿讯：马、司声明发表后，美民主党众议员柏德逊在众院发表演说称：“马歇尔特使为欲完成其使命而对中美两国有所贡献，唯有公开承认失败，即行归国。所有给予中国政府军事及经济上的援助应行停止，并且要告诉中国政府，如不实行杜鲁门去年十二月十五日对华政策中各项原则，美国将不再援助中国政府。”柏氏继指出：“蒋介石在政协会上的四项诺言及政协会各项决议，其中无一曾付诸实行，现情势已更每况愈下。”柏氏抨击国民党二中全会推翻政协决议的阴谋后指出：“此种妨害中国实行统一民主及停止内战之行为，显系得到美国政府之鼓励。”柏氏引证了在国民党二中全会开会期间，马歇尔曾来华府商洽以五亿美元贷给中国政府，以便在此期间，美国政府扩大援助国民党的事实为证，柏氏力称：“凡此一切，皆为一种鼓励，这足以证实美国外交政策已有强烈的反民主及帝国主义的色彩。”柏氏结语强调称：“我们可断言，希望马歇尔成功一层，不幸将成为泡影。中国现政府仍为一党专政之政府，中国和平统一及民主之实现不但未获进展，却因马歇尔之在中国而反受阻碍。我们必须反躬自问，马使所以未能完成使命究应由何人负责。本人深信中国及美国国内之恶势力不知羞耻地利用马使以遂其私欲，结果中国之民主与美国之安全以及世界和平均蒙其害。事实已很明显，即马使已没有获得成功之望。时机已到，吾人应通知中国政府，非俟依照杜鲁门对华政策宣言将其本质改变后，不能再自美国获得任何援助。召回马使，撤离在华美军，断绝一切对华军事及经济援助，即可使中国政府改变内战意向。”"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1946-08-29",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 26th: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th, the China Democratic League (CDL) hosted a press conference at a Shanghai restaurant on the afternoon of the 25th. Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongsun, Liang Shuming, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and about 70 reporters from various newspapers attended. A written statement of propositions on the current situation was released at the meeting, stating in brief: China is currently suffering from a civil war of unprecedented scale in history. If, after the closing of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), the government had quickly implemented the five resolutions and immediately fulfilled the four promises without a series of anti-PCC actions, the country could have moved towards peaceful unification. This was the first missed opportunity. On April 24th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a tea party of the PCC Comprehensive Group in Chongqing, also urging the representatives to go to Nanjing for consultation as soon as possible. If, after returning to the capital in May, he had truly adhered to this intention and consulted on matters, then there would certainly have been no unsolvable issues. Unexpectedly, the government fundamentally abandoned the Political Consultative Conference from April, which was another missed opportunity. On June 7th, the government ordered a ceasefire of 15 days, followed by a continuation of the ceasefire for eight days. During those twenty-odd days, the Military Three-Person Committee only consulted on three issues: the Northeast ceasefire, the restoration of transportation, and troop reorganization. By June 30th, more than 90 percent of the three issues had been resolved. The important difficulty was only the issue of local systems after the withdrawal of the Communist troops from northern Jiangsu and other places. Unfortunately, the authorities refused to sign, which was another missed opportunity. Today, the government pays lip service to implementing the PCC resolutions, but we must solemnly declare: The steps to implement the PCC resolutions are to simultaneously cease fire nationwide and reopen the PCC meeting or the PCC Comprehensive Group meeting. If convening a National Assembly to formulate a constitution, etc., does not follow the constitutional draft passed by the PCC as the only draft, but uses the so-called \"gathering opinions from all parties for reference,\" then this violates the spirit of the PCC and undermines the PCC resolutions, which is very clear. But we firmly support the PCC resolutions. During the meeting, Luo Longji supplemented the contents of the written statement, putting forward three hopes: (1) Immediately stop the civil war, (2) Implement the PCC resolutions, and (3) Uphold justice for the Kunming, Beiping, and Chengdu incidents. Subsequently, Liang Shuming reported on the investigation of the Li-Wen case in Kunming, explaining that the trip to Kunming was conducted solely by the CDL, and the investigation content will soon be published in a systematic report, and requesting that the case be sent to the special court of the Nanjing court for trial. After Zhang Dongsun and Luo Longji respectively reported on the Sun Zhongyuan incident in Beiping and the beating of CDL Chairman Zhang Lan in Chengdu, the meeting adjourned.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 26th: Mr. Li Furen, the Northwest负责人 (responsible person) of the CDL, who was not killed in an assassination attempt by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Xi'an but was rescued by the masses and came to Yan'an, sent a letter of condolence after learning that CDL Chairman Zhang Lan was beaten by special agent thugs at the memorial service for Mr. Wen and Mr. Li in Chengdu on August 18th. It stated: \"At this time when the world is in turmoil and everyone is in danger, we have painfully pointed out the dangerous situation and fought for justice, but unexpectedly, the reactionaries were ordered to disguise themselves as thugs and beat our CDL leader, a state elder, seventy years old, and watched by the world. If this person can be beaten, who cannot be beaten? If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our League hopes that political movements can exist legally, but the authorities are forcing a violent revolution underground. Since they are unwilling to pull back from the precipice and lay down their butcher knives, what else can I say?! I dare to hope that you will cherish yourself for the sake of the country!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民盟发表对时局主张  国民党一再违背协议破坏和平  应立即停止内战重开政协会议\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民盟发表对时局主张\n    国民党一再违背协议破坏和平\n    应立即停止内战重开政协会议\n    【新华社延安二十六日电】据中央社上海二十五日电：民主同盟二十五日下午假上海酒楼招待新闻界，到张君劢、张东荪、梁漱溟、沈钧儒、罗隆基、章伯钧等及各报记者七十余人。会中发表书面的对时局主张，略称：中国今日正遭受着一个历史上空前大规模的内战，假使在政协闭幕后政府对五项决议很快执行，并把四项诺言立即兑现而没有一连串的反政协行动，国家便可走向和平统一的途径，这是第一次错过机会。四月二十四日，蒋主席在渝召集政协会综合小组茶会，还敦促各代表从速到京协商，如在五月还都后真执着此意遇事协商，则亦必无不可解决之事，不料从四月政府根本放弃了政治协商会议，这是再一次错过机会。六月七日，政府下令休战十五天，其后继续休战八天，在那二十几天，只由军事三人委员会协商东北停战，恢复交通及整军等三个问题，到了六月三十日，三个问题已有了百分之九十以上得到了结论，重要的困难点不过苏北等地中共撤兵后的地方制度问题，无奈当局竟不签字，这又是再次错过机会。到了今天，政府口口声声说要实施政协决议，不过我们要严重声明：实施政协决议的步骤，为一面全国停战，一面重开政协会议或重开政协综合小组会议，如召开国民大会制定宪法等，不遵照政协通过的宪草为唯一的草案，而用所谓“会萃各方意见提供参考”的方式，这就违背了政协精神，破坏了政协决议，这是很明白的。但我们是坚决拥护政协决议的。会中由罗隆基补充书面谈话内容，提出三点希望：（一）立即停止内战，（二）实施政协决议，（三）对昆明、北平、成都事件主持公道。继由梁漱溟报告赴昆调查李闻案经过，说明此次赴昆系代表民盟单独进行调查工作，调查内容不久将发表有系统的报告，并要求将本发案解南京法院特别法庭审判。在张东荪及罗隆基分别报告北平孙中原事件及民盟主席张澜在蓉被殴经过后散会。\n    【新华社延安廿六日电】在西安被蒋介石特务暗杀未死而经群众救护来延之民盟西北负责人李敷仁氏，获悉民盟主席张澜于八月十八日在成都闻、李两氏追悼会上被特务暴徒殴打的消息后，特致函慰问。内称：“当此天下汹汹、人人自危之际，我们痛陈危局，仗义力争，不料反动分子竟受命伪装暴徒殴打，我公民盟领袖，国家元老，七旬高龄，四海瞩望。斯人可打，孰不可打？斯而可忍，孰不可忍？本盟希望政治运动合法存在，而当局立逼暴力革命地下进行。彼既不愿悬崖勒马，放下屠刀，我复何言？！敢望我公为国珍重！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: *Pravda* international observer Viktorov wrote on the 25th: The simultaneous application of unwarranted pressure by the United States on Yugoslavia and by the United Kingdom and the United States on Poland cannot be regarded as a mere coincidence. Everyone remembers that American planes flew over Yugoslavia as many as 172 times. The US government used the pretext of a Yugoslav aircraft forcing an American plane to land and issued an unusually stern note to Yugoslavia, demanding in a *diktat*-like manner the release of the detained passengers within 48 hours. American newspapers, as if at the wave of a company commander's baton, launched a heated anti-Yugoslav campaign, demanding the most resolute action against an allied country that was defending its legitimate rights. American newspapers even discovered in this \"incident\" an excuse to break up the peace conference. A United Press Paris correspondent stated that Byrnes was prepared to agree to the failure of the peace conference; if the goal of the struggle against Yugoslavia was not achieved, it would cause the peace conference to break up. The American ultimatum came too late; Yugoslavia had released the pilot before receiving it. Thanks to the statesmanship of the small country of Yugoslavia, the \"incident\" did not deteriorate. However, the fact remains that a major power used unprecedentedly crude pressure against a small country. The general impression is that this action was intended to place Yugoslavia in an unequal position when the peace conference discussed issues related to Yugoslavia, and the United Press correspondent also acknowledged this point. As for Anglo-Polish relations, the United Kingdom's behavior in issuing a note to Poland regarding future elections can only be seen as open interference in Poland's internal affairs. The British note not only ordered Poland to hold elections in accordance with the conditions set forth in the note but also demanded that the Polish electoral law be sent to the British ambassador so that the British government \"can decide whether it includes the provisions that the United Kingdom hopes to observe.\" The United States also issued a similar note to Poland, although not in a *diktat*-like manner. It is not difficult to see that the United Kingdom's diplomatic pressure on Poland has a clear purpose, namely, to infringe upon the independent sovereignty of a free and independent Polish state. The Anglo-American diplomatic pressure on Yugoslavia and Poland demonstrates the true attitude of the Anglo-American bloc toward small countries, an attitude that provides a strong basis for assessing the actions of the Anglo-American bloc at the peace conference.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 真理报评英美粗暴外交  侵犯南波独立主权  意图破坏和会工作进行\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　真理报评英美粗暴外交\n    侵犯南波独立主权\n    意图破坏和会工作进行\n    【新华社延安廿六日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家维克特罗夫二十五日撰文称：美国对南斯拉夫、英美对波兰同时施行绝无正当理由的压力，人们不能把这看成是偶然的巧合。每个人都记得，美机飞行于南国上空共达一七二次，美国政府利用南国飞机迫使美机一架降落的口实，向南提出了措词空前严峻的照会，用哀的美敦书的方式，要求在四十八小时内释放机上被扣乘客。美国报纸好象在一个连队指挥者杆子一挥之下发动了火热的反南运动，要求对于维护其正当权利的盟国采取最坚决的行动。美国报纸甚至在此“事件”中发现了和会破裂的借口。合众社巴黎访员称：贝纳斯准备同意和会的失败；如果对南斗争的目的未达到，它会使和会破裂。美国的通牒来得太迟了，南国在接获它之前就释放了驾机师，由于南斯拉夫小国的政治家风度，“事件”并未恶化下去，然而一个大国对小国使用了空前未有的粗暴压力，则是事实。一般人的印象是此种行动意图在和会讨论与南有关问题时，将南国置于不平等的地位，而合众社访员也承认了这一点。至于英波关系，英国关于未来选举，向波兰提出照会的行为，只有被认为是对波兰内政的公开干涉。英国照会不仅命令波兰遵照照会所提的条件举行选举，而且要求应将波兰选举法送交英大使，以便英国政府“可以决定其中是否包括有英国希望前往观察的条款在内”。美国向波兰也提出了同样的照会，虽然不是用哀的美敦书方式。不难看出：英对波兰的外交压力是会着明确的目的，即侵犯自由独立的波兰国家的独立主权。美英对南波的外交压力，表明了英美集团对小国的真正态度，这种态度提供了强有力的根据来估计英美集团各国在和会上的行动。"

    "content": "Old Hero Cultivates New Heroes\n    Wang Qishou Trains Troops While Fighting\n    Entire Company Achieves Average Grenade Throw of 39.2 Meters\n\n    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch, 24th] Comrade Wang Qishou, the company commander of the Eighth Company of the Independent First Regiment of the Fourth Military Sub-district of the Taiyue Military Region, is a model of fighting and training troops. He once served as the captain of the Yicheng Fourth District Cadre Team and was a hero in the struggle against the enemy within the grid network. He was also a top combat hero at the first Taiyue District Heroes Conference. The characteristic of his leadership is that he can both fight and seize opportunities for education. He created a style of training troops by utilizing the gaps in combat within the grid network, and this characteristic is still maintained and developed today. This year, due to the need to defend positions, the Eighth Company was unable to conduct concentrated training specifically, but the Eighth Company created training achievements that surpassed any other company. The average grenade throw of the entire company was 39.2 meters, and this achievement is inseparable from the leadership of Comrade Wang Qishou. He can seize every gap to conduct training, and he has created many \"Wang Qishous,\" turning some squad leaders and platoon leaders into his embodiment and spreading them to every corner. Therefore, seizing the gaps to conduct training has become a unique style of the Eighth Company. In March of this year, when the Eighth Company was on guard duty at Majialing, one platoon was sentry, and two platoons were training behind the front line positions. In the middle of the night, before dawn, behind the hillside, and on the parade ground, entire squads and platoons practiced bayonet fighting and grenade throwing. Squad Leader Li ×× is a typical embodiment of Comrade Qishou. Li's body is very weak, but he won first place in the entire company in training. He learned Comrade Wang Qishou's style of being good at uniting comrades and encouraging everyone's morale. Once, when the enemy launched an attack on our front-line position, one platoon of the Eighth Company was on guard in another direction. In addition to sending out sentries to monitor the direction from which the enemy might come, the entire platoon used stones in place of grenades, practicing grenade throwing towards the blind spots that the enemy might use. On the one hand, they prepared for battle, and on the other hand, they practiced martial arts, making use of every bit of time. Another time, when the enemy launched an attack on our outpost position, the Eighth Company was placed in a reserve position preparing for action. Then, the squad leaders taught the soldiers, and the veteran soldiers taught the new soldiers. Everyone, based on the specific terrain and distance, educated the soldiers where the enemy might come from, where they might go, how many meters away, where the effective shooting range of the rifle was, designated targets, and practiced aiming and shooting. Comrade Wang Qishou is good at leadership and can lead by example, which has won the love and support of the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 老英雄培养新英雄  王启首战斗不忘练兵  全连投弹平均三·九二公尺\n\n1946-08-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　老英雄培养新英雄\n    王启首战斗不忘练兵\n    全连投弹平均三·九二公尺\n    【本报阳城二十四日电】太岳四分区独一团八连连长王启首同志是战斗与练兵的模范，他曾任翼城四区干队队长，是格子网里对敌斗争的英雄，是太岳区第一届群英大会的头等战斗英雄。他带兵的特色是既能打仗，又能抓住机会进行教育。他曾在格子网里创造出一套利用战斗空隙练兵的作风，这个特色至今仍在保持和发挥着。今年因为坚守阵地的关系，八连未能专门集中整训，但八连却创造出超过任何连队的练兵成绩，全连平均投弹三九·二米，这成绩是和王启首同志的领导分不开的。他能抓紧一切空隙进行练兵，而且创造出许多的王启首，把一些班长排长都变成了他的化身，散布到每个角落里。因之抓紧空隙进行练兵，就成为八连的特有作风。今年三月里八连在马家岭担任警戒，一个排放哨，两个排在前沿阵地后方练兵，在半夜里、拂晓前、山坡后和操场上，整班整排练习刺枪和投弹。九班长李××同志是启首同志的典型化身，李的身体很弱，但却在练兵中荣获全连第一。他学会了王启首同志善于团结同志又善于鼓励大家情绪的作风。有一次敌人向我们的前沿阵地进攻，八连的一个排在另一个方向担任警戒，他们除派出哨兵监视着敌人可能来的方向外，全排人都以石头代手榴弹，向着敌人可能利用的死角做着投弹练习，一方面准备战斗，一方面又练了武，把一点时间都利用了。又有一次敌人向我们前哨阵地进攻，八连被放在预备阵地里准备着，于是班长教战士，老兵教新兵，大家根据具体的地形及距离，教育战士敌人可能从那里来，到那里去，多少米达、那里是步枪的有效射击距离，指定目标，作射击瞄准，王启首同志善于领导又能以身作则，获得了群众的爱戴和拥护。"

All were equipped with American weaponry, and the captured materials are currently being inventoried. This marks the fourth crushing defeat inflicted on the Chiang troops invading central Jiangsu since their large-scale offensive in mid-July, following the previous annihilating blows at Taixing, southern Rugao, and east of Haian. To date, the Chiang troops have lost over 36,000 officers and soldiers on the southern front of central Jiangsu alone, not including the losses inflicted on the Chiang troops by local militia and guerrillas. The Rugao line is the main direction of the Chiang army's offensive on the southern front. Since the Chiang army occupied Rugao City on the 23rd of last month, they have only advanced north to Haian Town, over 20 kilometers from Rugao City, in the past month. Dingyan and Linzi are both located on the transportation line from Nantong to Rugao. As of now, the eastern and southeastern parts of Rugao occupied by the Chiang army have been threatened.\n\nThis newspaper, Yangcheng, 25th: In the victorious self-defense operation in Huo County, a total of over 2,000 Yan-puppet troops, including the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Division and the \"Love the Homeland Corps,\" were completely disarmed by the Eighth Route Army.

The surrounding strongholds of the city, including Zhangjiabao, Bailong Village, Tandiqi, Dazhang, Xizhang, Shima, Tuisha, Wangzhuang, Yangjiashan, and Baishan, more than ten locations in all, have been completely cleared by the Eighth Route Army.\n\nThis newspaper, Changzhi, 25th: On the morning of the 22nd, over 1,200 Yan-puppet troops, including Shen Rui of the 71st Division of the Yan army, from Yangquan and Langyu stations (both under Pinding County) on the Zhengtai Line, attacked the Nangouzhang area in the western liberated area of Pinding County. Our army rose up in self-defense and, after four hours of fierce fighting, killed and wounded over 200 Yan-puppet troops, captured over ten, and seized one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, and dozens of rifles.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, August 25th. Comprehensive reports from various places in Jiangsu and Anhui: After the anti-war and strike-breaking officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army came to the liberated areas, their lives and thoughts have made significant progress in a short period of time. Their daily remarks show their consistent hatred for the civil war and dictatorship, and their desire for peace and democracy. The officers and soldiers of the 92nd Brigade and the 172nd Brigade of the Kuomintang army, who went on strike in Yugou and Sixian, lived a free and happy life in some reception centers. During the day, they read newspapers, read books, and chatted about current affairs. In the evening, they sang and entertained collectively. They could eat eggs every day, and eat meat once every two days. They gratefully said: \"In the past, when we were soldiers, we couldn't see any meat for half a year.\" When it came to fighting the civil war, they all said: \"We were deceived and forced to come.\" Xu, the platoon leader of the 188th company of the 276th Regiment, said: \"Only those officials are willing to fight the civil war, they can be promoted and make a fortune, and our fate will be poor all our lives. We are unwilling for Chinese people to fight Chinese people.\" They believed that striking in the battlefield was the best way to oppose the civil war. Guo Yunlong, the squad leader of the fifth squad of the first company of the first battalion of the 276th Regiment, excitedly described how he and the platoon leader put up four machine guns and sixteen rifles and handed them over to the New Fourth Army. He went on to say: \"I think the only good way to save the country, the people, and ourselves in the civil war is to lay down our arms.\" A Kuomintang army officer of the 92nd Division, when he was in Nanjing, heard that he was going to the north to fight the civil war. He wrote two sentences on the wall to express his attitude: \"This road will not work, go to Mao Zedong.\" The officers and soldiers from non-direct line troops were even more indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's unequal treatment of the so-called \"miscellaneous brands.\" Hu Shusheng, the company commander of the fifth company of the second battalion of the 514th Regiment of the Guizhou Army, said: \"Our Guangxi army is being reduced more and more, while Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops are being increased more and more. The only one who has a way out in the Guangxi army is Bai Chongxi, who sells himself out, and the rest are only demoted and not promoted. I have been a company commander for five or six years, and I have long been unwilling to do it. When your guns fired, I said to my brothers: 'It is better for us to go to the New Fourth Army, I heard that the New Fourth Army is very good, let's all go there!' All the brothers of the fifth company immediately followed me.\" Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Qin Desheng said: \"Chiang Kai-shek is determined to eliminate dissidents. Many old men in their fifties and sixties in our Guangxi army are forced to fight the civil war and die.\" When I arrived at Da Zhouzhuang (near Sixian), I reported to the battalion commander that I was hungry and couldn't walk, and he scolded me for rebelling, pulled out his box cannon and wanted to shoot me. When your guns fired, he slipped away. I said to my brothers, lie down and don't fight. The brothers all agreed, and we came over.\" Luo Xinxi, the major battalion deputy of the 19th Regiment of the New 7th Brigade of the 21st Division of the Kuomintang Army, who went on strike in the war east of Hai'an, said: \"In the 30th year of the Republic of China, I was stationed in Fanchang, southern Anhui, with the 50th Army. At that time, under the order of Chiang Kai-shek and Gu Zhutong, I participated in the encirclement and suppression of the headquarters of the New Fourth Army. I immediately understood their intention to eliminate dissidents. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, many puppet troops joined. The internal factions were complicated, and the central puppet central army was indistinguishable. The country bumpkins from Sichuan and the foreign devils who graduated from the Army University fought endlessly. The latter had just come out of school and held real power, doing whatever they wanted. We natives were not from the direct line, so we were not popular.\" Colonel Regiment Commander Liu Quanmin said: \"I used to be forced to participate in the evil civil war. Today, I can still participate in the democratic front to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. It is the greatest luck in my life.\" In addition to some who wanted to go home, the New Fourth Army gave them travel expenses to send them home (on July 28, a certain place in central Jiangsu happily sent 107 Kuomintang soldiers who laid down their arms in the Taixing Rugao battle home). Most of them were willing to stay in the liberated area to participate in democratic construction. Some of them have also taken up weapons again to avenge the reactionaries who have oppressed them for many years. Zhu Yide, a Kuomintang soldier who came over in the Taixing battle last month, captured three rifles and one prisoner in the Chenqiao battle. Yang Guisheng of the machine gun and artillery company hit six out of eight shots when shelling the Kuomintang army's bunkers. Hu Liangyu was injured in the Fenjie battle. The commander personally comforted him and gave him recuperation expenses. He said with emotion: \"There has never been such a thing in the Central Army. When the wound is slightly healed, I will ask to go to the front line again.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏皖蒋军放下武器官兵  痛恨蒋介石驱使内战  炮兵已调转炮口轰击进犯蒋军  广西军越编越少  白崇禧卖身投靠\n\n1946-08-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏皖蒋军放下武器官兵\n    痛恨蒋介石驱使内战\n    炮兵已调转炮口轰击进犯蒋军\n    广西军越编越少\n    白崇禧卖身投靠\n    【新华社二十五日电】综合苏皖各地报导：蒋军各部反战罢战官兵来到解放区后，不久生活思想都有很显著的进展，从他们日常言论中表现出对内战独裁一致的仇恨和对和平民主的渴望。先后在渔沟泗县两地罢战的蒋军九十二旅与一七二旅官兵，在某些招待所过着自由愉快的生活，白天看报、看书、漫谈时事，晚上集体娱乐拉拉唱唱，每天能吃到鸡蛋，每两天能吃到一次肉。他们感激的说：“过去当士兵半年也看不到一点肉。”说到打内战一致表示：“我们是被骗来的被逼来的。”二七六团一八八连徐排长说：“打内战只有当官的那些小子愿意，他们可以升官发财，而我们一辈子命运是穷光蛋，我们是不愿中国人打中国人的。”他们认为在战场上罢战是反对内战最好的办法。二七六团一营一连五班上的班长郭云龙，兴奋地叙述他和排长把四挺机枪和十六枝步枪架起来交给新四军的经过。接着说：“我认为在内战中只有自己放下武器是救国救民救自己的好办法。”九十二师一个军官在南京时，听说要到北方打内战，他在墙上题了两句话来表示态度：“此路行不通，去奔毛泽东。”来自非嫡系部队官兵，更愤慨蒋介石对所谓“杂牌”的不平等待遇。桂军一七二旅五一四团二营五连连长胡树生说：“我们广西军越编越少，蒋介石嫡系部队则越编越多。广西军队里有出路的只有卖身投靠的白崇禧一个，其余的只有降级没有升级。我干了五六年还是个连长，我早就不愿干了，当着你们的枪一响，我就向兄弟们说：‘内战打死我们，不如我们都过新四军那边，听说新四军那边很好，我们都过去吧！’一呼百应五连兄弟马上跟着过来了。”少尉排长秦德胜说：“蒋介石一心想消灭异己，我们广西军里很多五六十岁的老头子逼着他们打内战送死。”我走到大周庄（按在泗县附近）就报告营长说：“我肚子饿了走不动，他骂我想造反，掏出盒子枪要枪毙我。等到你们枪一响他就溜之大吉，我对弟兄们说卧倒不打了，弟兄们都同意，我们就过来了。”在海安以东战争中，罢战的蒋军二十一师新七旅十九团少校营副罗心喜说：“民国三十年我在五十军驻皖南繁昌，当时在蒋介石顾祝同命令下参加围歼新四军军部。即明了他们居心消灭异己。抗战胜利后，加入许多伪军，内部派系复杂，中央伪中央军不分，四川行伍出身的土包子和陆军大学毕业生的洋鬼子斗争不休。后者刚从学校出来掌握实权，为所欲为，我们土棍子因为不是嫡系就吃不开。”上校团长刘权民说：“过去被迫参加罪恶内战的我，今天还能参加民主阵线反对蒋介石的独裁。是一生中的大幸。”他们除一部分希望回家的由新四军发给路费遣送回家（七月二十八日苏中某地即曾欢送泰兴如皋战役中放下武器之蒋军一部一百零七人回家），另外大多数都愿留在解放区参加民主建设，一部分并已重握武器向多年欺压他们的反动派复仇。上月泰兴战役中过来的蒋军士兵朱一德，在陈桥战斗中一次缴到三枝步枪，捉到一个俘虏；机炮连杨贵生，炮击蒋军碉堡连放八炮命中六炮。胡良玉在分界战斗中挂了彩，指挥员亲自慰问他并发给疗养费，他感动的说：“在中央军里从来没有这样的事，等伤口稍好我要求再上前线。”"

The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Youth Federation in the Liberated Areas recently sent a telegram congratulating the International Student Conference in Prague, Czechoslovakia, stating: Just as students around the world are emerging from the fires of war to concentrate on their studies, students and youth in the Chinese Liberated Areas are not only being prevented by Chiang Kai-shek from sending their representatives to attend the conference, but are also undergoing another slaughter following the Japanese occupation. The United States, while \"mediating,\" is supplying Chiang Kai-shek's government with artillery, making it difficult to quell the flames of the Chinese civil war. In the Kuomintang-controlled cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Chongqing, Kunming and other cities, more than a thousand young students have been slaughtered and arrested by Chiang Kai-shek in July and August alone for opposing the civil war. The telegram calls on the conference to pay attention to the threat of the Chinese civil war to world peace, to provide possible assistance to the suffering of Chinese youth, and to welcome the conference to send a delegation to visit and investigate the Chinese Liberated Areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放区青联筹委会  电贺国际学生大会  控诉蒋介石屠杀中国青年\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放区青联筹委会\n    电贺国际学生大会\n    控诉蒋介石屠杀中国青年\n    【新华社延安二十五日电】中国解放区青年联合会筹委会，顷致电祝贺捷京布拉格国际学生大会，略称：正当全世界学生走出了战争之火专心读书的时候，中国解放区的学生青年不仅被蒋介石阻挠，不能派遣自己的代表出席大会，而且正继日本宰割后的又一次屠杀。美国一面“调停”，一面大炮接济蒋介石政府，于是中国内战之火便难以收拾了。在国民党统治区的南京、上海、北平、重庆、昆明等城市，青年学生因反对内战而被蒋介石屠杀逮捕者仅七八两月份就在千人以上。该电要求大会对中国内战对全世界和平的威胁予以注意，对中国青年所受灾难予以可能的援助，并欢迎大会派遣参观团到中国解放区来参观考察。"

    "content": "Our Army in Northern Henan Launches Self-Defense Counterattack\n    Once Occupying the East and South Gates of Hui County\n    Two Companies of Chiang's Army Uprising on the Battlefield\n    [This dispatch from Changzhi, 25th] The Chiang Kai-shek's troops launched a large-scale offensive against our Northern Henan, and our army was forced to defend itself. Following the recovery of Yancun, east of Hui County, on the evening of the 11th, a self-defense counterattack was launched on the evening of the 20th. After fierce fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek troops and puppet army's more than ten strongholds around Hui County, including Gaozhuang Town, Changcun, Yangzhuang, Guzhang, Beichenmai, Huangtu, and East and West Gengcun, were completely wiped out that night. On the 21st, they forced their way into the suburbs of the city. On the 22nd, a part of our army captured Xinzhuang, a stronghold of the puppet army southwest of Hui County, annihilating more than 100 puppet soldiers. Taking advantage of the victory, they occupied the East Gate and South Gate. In the battle on the East Gate, two companies and two additional squads of the 177th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek's 38th Division, deeply moved by our battlefield appeals and understanding of righteousness, were unwilling to be used by Chiang Kai-shek as tools for the civil war and make unnecessary sacrifices. They launched an anti-civil war uprising on the front line and entered our army's position. After our army annihilated the die-hard remnants of Chiang's army, it moved into the East Gate. On the 23rd, Chiang's army in Xinxiang came to reinforce with air and ground coordination. Our army has now moved to a stand-off in the suburbs of the city.\n    [This dispatch from Jiaozuo, 23rd] Our correspondent at the front learned that before Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale offensive against the Northern Henan liberated area, Bai Chongxi was specially dispatched to Xinxiang three times to carry out civil war deployments. At a meeting of Kuomintang army officers above the battalion level, Bai Chongxi arrogantly incited his subordinates, saying, \"Chairman Chiang has made the greatest determination to eliminate the CCP by force, and we have no room for compromise with the CCP.\" He also said, \"Our army has excellent American weapons, and we are much better equipped than we were in the early days of the War of Resistance, while the CCP's current weapons are not as good as those used by our army in the early days of the War of Resistance.\" The Chiang Kai-shek's war faction only knows that war is determined by American weapons, but does not know that war is more importantly determined by the soldiers who hold the weapons and the people who support the soldiers. Therefore, Bai Chongxi's mobilization is only a kind of anesthetic for the war faction to its subordinates.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北我军自卫反击  一度占领辉县东关南关  蒋军两个连在战场起义\n\n1946-08-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北我军自卫反击\n    一度占领辉县东关南关\n    蒋军两个连在战场起义\n    【本报长治二十五日电】蒋伪军大举向我豫北进攻，我军被迫自卫，继十一日晚恢复辉县城东之沿村后，二十日晚举行自卫反击，经激战后，当夜即将辉县城四周之高庄镇、常村、杨庄、古章、北陈麦、黄土、东西耿村等蒋伪十余据点完全扫除，二十一日迫进城郊，二十二日我军一部攻克辉县城西南之伪军据点新庄，歼伪军百余，当即乘胜占领东关与南关。在东关方面的战斗中，蒋军三八师一七七旅两个连及另外两个班，经我战场喊话，晓以大义，深受感动，不愿为蒋介石充作内战工具，作无谓之牺牲，乃于火线上举行反内战起义，开入我军阵地，我军于歼灭顽抗之蒋军残部后，进驻东关。二十三日新乡蒋军以陆空配合来援，现我军转入城郊对峙。\n    【本报焦作二十三日电】本社前线记者获悉：此次蒋介石大举进攻豫北解放区前，曾专派白崇禧三赴新乡，进行内战部署，动员在一次国民党军营级以上干部会议上，白崇禧曾狂妄的煽动其部下说：“蒋主席已下最大决心，要以武力消灭中共，我们与中共决无妥协的余地”。又说：“我军有优良的美国武器，我们已比抗战初期的武器好得多，而中共现在的武器，还不如抗战初期我军所使用者。”蒋介石好战集团，只知战争决定于美式武器，而不知战争更重要的决定于拿武器的士兵和供养士兵的人民，因此白崇禧此种动员，只是好战集团对其部下的一种麻醉剂而已。"

The Kuomintang's 55th Brigade's proclamation strictly prohibiting passage through the railway was torn to shreds, and slogans such as \"Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Dictatorial and Traitorous Country and Fight the Civil War\" appeared on the walls. Children enthusiastically helped the battlefield work team post the CCP Central Committee's \"July 7th\" Declaration. Many people voluntarily acted as guides for our army and staff, and handed over bullets left behind by the Chiang army. Vendors, road workers, and women rushed to stuff watermelons, cigarettes, and other慰劳品(comforting goods) into the hands of the comrades of the work team, and said enthusiastically, \"We have been looking forward to you for a long time, you have finally arrived.\" An old lady said, \"The Chiang army is even worse than the Japanese, if you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to survive.\" When the work team rescued six thousand 石(dàn, unit of dry measure for grain) of wheat and sorghum that the Kuomintang's 74th Brigade had forcibly requisitioned from various villages and hid in warehouses to provide relief to the poor, they all shed tears of gratitude. Gao Xingzhou, who used to be an officer in the Northeast Army and later became a refugee, said happily, \"When I was in Kaifeng, I didn't receive even half a 两(Liang, traditional Chinese unit of weight) of all that relief flour.

    "content": "【This dispatch from Weixian, August 23rd】The Jinnan District Party Committee, in order to fully mobilize the masses, enable the peasants to thoroughly emancipate themselves, and strengthen self-defense capabilities, convened an enlarged meeting on the 8th of this month to study the problem of unifying thought and concentrating efforts to mobilize the masses. At the beginning of the meeting, Political Commissar Li spoke, and after making a simple and concise conclusion about the work in Jinnan, he pointed out that all comrades must recognize that the peasant emancipation movement is the most fundamental historical task of the Party at present, and is the most basic link in all work; otherwise, no work can be done well. To this end, the leadership must consciously relax and postpone some secondary work, and firmly grasp the central task of mass emancipation. Political Commissar Li emphasized that all levels of organization must fully support and participate in the mass movement, and try to extract a large number of cadres to organize emancipation teams to go to the countryside. He said: The people's army should have two basic tasks, one is to fight and defend the liberated areas with arms, and the other is to support and participate in the mass movement. He said that the government is the people's government, and it should not only care about and sympathize with the mass emancipation movement, but also fully participate in and support this movement. He called on cadres to break through all worries and obstacles, not be bound by anything, and boldly and vigorously mobilize the masses, and correct the work style of taking over everything and issuing administrative orders. He pointed out: We must not only mobilize the masses, but also cultivate local cadres; these two are indispensable. Then, the meeting unfolded a lively discussion on Political Commissar Li's speech. Deputy Political Commissar Ma pointed out two points: First, we must fully support the mass movement, and unify it ideologically and organizationally. This is the center of all our work in Jinnan. Second, mass emancipation is a momentous event, and it is also very difficult, so we must unify our forces, and the troops and the government must send cadres down. Other comrades also made enthusiastic speeches on the issue of unifying thinking, concentrating efforts, and vigorously supporting and carrying out the mass movement. At the same time, the meeting also discussed the issues of mass viewpoint and leadership style in great detail. Finally, Political Commissar Wang made a summary. In his summary, he more earnestly pointed out that we must make up our minds that if we do not relax on secondary matters, it will be difficult to accomplish the main ones. He also instructed all departments to consider how to link the mass movement with their own work, and to center around this central task; otherwise, no work can be done well.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南区党委召开扩大会议  全力发动群众翻透身  各级组织要大力支持参加群运\n\n1946-08-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南区党委召开扩大会议\n    全力发动群众翻透身\n    各级组织要大力支持参加群运\n    【本报威县二十三日电】冀南区党委为了全力发动群众，使农民翻透身，以增强自卫力量起见，特于本月八日召开扩大会议，研究统一思想，集中力量发动群众的问题。大会首由李政委发言，他对冀南工作作了简单扼要的结论后，指出全体同志须认识农民翻身运动是目前党的最基本的历史任务，是一切工作最基本的环节，否则一切工作没法作好。为此，领导上对次要工作须有意识的放松与推迟一些，要紧紧抓住群众翻身这个中心工作。李政委强调指出各级组织要全力支持与参加群众运动，尽量抽出大批干部，组织翻身队下乡，他说：人民的军队应有两个基本任务，一是打仗，武装保卫解放区，一是支持与参加群众运动，二者缺一不可。他说政府是人民的政府，对于群众翻身运动不只应关心和同情，而且应全力参加与支持这个运动。他号召干部要打破一切顾虑与阻碍，不受任何束缚，大胆泼辣的把群众发动起来，纠正包办代替、行政命令的作风。他指出：我们不但要把群众发动起来，而且要培养起当地干部，二者缺一不可。接着大会展开对李政委发言的热烈讨论，马副政委指出两点：第一、要全力支持群运，从思想上组织上统一起来，这是我冀南一切工作的中心。第二、群众翻身是天大的事情，也是非常困难的，故须统一力量，部队政府都要抽出干部下去。其他同志也都对统一思想、集中力量、大力支持与开展群众运动的问题，作了热烈的发言。同时在会议上对群众观点与领导作风问题，也讨论的很详尽。最后由王政委作总结，他在总结中更恳切的指出，我们须要下决心，不放松次要的即很难将主要的完成。并指示各部门，要考虑如何使群众运动与自己本身工作联系起来，都围绕这一中心工作，不然一切工作都搞不好。"

The original text is summarized as follows:\n\nComrades of the Workers', Peasants', Youth, and Women's Associations, militiamen, and members of the Children's Corps:\n\nChiang Kai-shek is afraid that we will have land to cultivate and food to eat, and he won't let us live a good life. He has turned to the American reactionaries and is attacking our liberated areas. To love our country and defend ourselves, we must mobilize immediately, join the army and participate in the war, unite the military and civilians, defend the border areas, and strive for peace at an early date. (1) Our young workers, peasants, and militiamen should take the lead in joining the army, and women members and Children's Corps members should serve as models in persuading their husbands, fathers, and brothers to join the army. (2) Workers, peasants, youth, women members, and militiamen should actively participate in the war, undertaking various war support tasks such as guarding, delivering messages, and comforting the troops. (3) Workers, peasants, youth, women members, militiamen, and Children's Corps members at home should lead the masses of the whole village in doing a good job of giving preferential treatment to military families and families of those participating in the war or on business trips. Help with the autumn harvest, wheat planting, fetching water, grinding flour, and organizing temporary mutual aid groups. (4) Union members should step up production to supply the front lines. Print more propaganda to let everyone know the victory news and what should be done at any time. (5) After the war mobilization work is completed, continue to mobilize the masses for mutual aid production. Let's all mobilize together to the end, and victory will surely be ours.\n\n[Another Dispatch] The party, government, military, and civilians in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area are supporting the front lines with active work enthusiasm. Since the beginning of the war of self-defense, the heads of various leading organs have set off separately to go deep into various sub-districts to assist in the work, and the responsible cadres of various counties and districts have personally organized and led the masses to rush to the front lines. After holding a meeting of district cadres, Gaoling County discussed work and current affairs issues, overcame ideological slackness and paralysis, and decided to mobilize the majority of the masses within a month to thoroughly overturn the old order, so that the land problem could be reasonably resolved, and the landless or land-poor peasants would have land to cultivate and food to eat. Linze County seized the gap in the war and continued to deepen mass mobilization, deciding to thoroughly resolve the peasants' land problem. In order to do a good job of supporting the front lines, Puyang County established a command post from the county to the district and village levels, divided into four sections: supply, transportation, security, and reception. Each village organized cart teams, wheelbarrow teams, and stretcher groups. The entire county has now been fully mobilized. In order for the people in the newly liberated areas to be able to read the newspapers, the newspaper printing team of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Printing Bureau has increased the daily printing of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily by 2,000 copies. The work that used to be done by 24 people can now be completed on time by 16 people. Propaganda and education cadres from various departments in the Fifth District of Juancheng strengthened their study of current affairs in order to complete the current urgent tasks, to improve their work ability, and stipulate that monthly tests will be implemented. The masses in Anlingji, Heze, are concerned about current affairs, and merchants have automatically organized five newspaper reading groups, reading newspapers on the streets every afternoon. After listening to Mr. Soong Ching Ling's statement, the masses said in unison: \"The wife of the Kuomintang teacher is against Old Chiang fighting a civil war, it seems that Old Chiang will not last long.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫各联武委总会号召全体会员民兵  紧急动员参战自卫  各机关干部深入各地协助工作支援前线\n\n1946-08-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫各联武委总会号召全体会员民兵\n    紧急动员参战自卫\n    各机关干部深入各地协助工作支援前线\n    【本报荷泽二十五日电】冀鲁豫军区工农青妇联合总会暨武委会总会，顷发表告全体会员团员和民兵书，号召全区人民紧急动员起来，参战自卫，打退蒋军的进攻。原文略称：\n    工农青妇会员、民兵、和儿童团团员们：\n    蒋介石怕咱们有地种有饭吃，不让咱们过好日子。他投靠美国反动派，向咱们解放区进攻。咱们要爱国，要自卫，必须紧急动员起来，参军参战，军民团结，保卫边区，早日争回和平。（一）咱们年轻的工农会员和民兵们要带头参军，妇女会员儿童团员要作劝夫劝父兄参军的模范。（二）工农青妇会员和民兵要积极参战，担负放哨、送信、慰劳军队等各种战争后勤工作。（三）在家的工农青妇会员、民兵、儿童团员要带领全村群众做好优待军属和参战出差家属的工作。帮助秋收、种麦子、打水、磨面、组织临时互助组。（四）工会会员们要加油生产，供给前线。多印宣传品，让每个人随时知道胜利消息，和应做的事情。（五）战争动员工作完成后，就继续发动群众互助生产。咱们一齐动员起来干到底，胜利一定是我们的。\n    【又电】冀鲁豫边区党政军民，以积极的工作热情，支援前线。自卫战争开始后，各领导机关负责人，即分别出发深入各分区协助工作，各县区的负责干部，则亲自组织带领群众赶赴前线。高陵县日前召开区干部会议后，讨论工作与时事问题，克服了思想上的松懈麻痹，决定在一个月内发动大多数群众彻底翻身，使土地问题得到合理解决，使无地或地少的贫农，有地种有饭吃。临泽县七区抓紧战争空隙，继续深入群运，决定彻底解决农民土地问题。濮县为了把支援前线的工作作好，由县到区村成立了指挥部，分设供给、运输、保卫、招待四股，每村组织大车，小车队与担架组。现全县已全部动员起来。冀鲁豫印刷局印报组为了新解放区人民能看到报纸，每日增印冀鲁豫日报二千份。过去二十四个人的工作，现在十六个人就可按时完成。鄄城五区各部门宣教干部，为完成目前紧急任务，特加强时事学习，以提高工作能力，并规定每月实行测验。荷泽安陵集群众关心时事，商人自动组织五个读报组，每日下午在街头读报。群众听了宋庆龄先生的声明，都不约而同的说：“国民党老师父的太太都反对老蒋打内战，看样子老蒋不会长久了。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th, the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party received the press at 3:30 PM on the 26th, hosted by Zhou Enlai. During the reception, summaries of the \"Immediate Unconditional Ceasefire and Implementation of Political Consultative Conference Resolutions\" editorial from the Xinhua News Agency-printed Masses Weekly were distributed as the CCP's formal statement on the current situation. The statement briefly stated: \"The *Masses* magazine, published in Shanghai on August 25th, published a lengthy editorial in response to Chairman Chiang's August 14th statement, titled 'Immediate Unconditional Ceasefire and Implementation of Political Consultative Conference Resolutions.' I believe that Chairman Chiang's statement not only failed to change this situation, but also worsened it, because the conditions for a ceasefire he proposed were that 'the Communist troops withdraw from many areas and the locally elected governments be abolished, to be taken over by the Kuomintang one-party government.'\" The editorial pointed out how the government authorities overturned the ceasefire, the Political Consultative Conference, military reorganization and other agreements, for example, after the announcement of the January ceasefire agreement, the government side consistently failed to implement a ceasefire in the Northeast, failed to accept General Marshall's proposal, and failed to dispatch executive groups to the Northeast, which the CCP immediately approved. Later, although there was an agreement on March 27th, which allowed the dispatch of groups to the Northeast, the government side then violated the agreement by refusing a ceasefire and engaging in large-scale fighting in the Northeast. Even after the June truce, the offensive in the Northeast temporarily eased, but the offensive within the passes spread north and south of the Yellow River. The Kuomintang government still occupies 59 county towns and more than 3,000 villages in our liberated areas.\n\n　　During the June ceasefire negotiations, the CCP, in an effort to achieve peace, did not hesitate to make significant concessions in supplementary agreements on issues such as a ceasefire in the Northeast, restoration of transportation, and military reorganization. However, during the negotiations, the government authorities unreasonably raised the issue of the US side having the final say... Just as the agreement was about to be concluded, the government suddenly demanded that the CCP troops and local elected governments withdraw from Subei, along the Jiaoji Railway, south of Chengde in Rehe, and Andong, otherwise the four agreements could not be signed and a ceasefire would be difficult to achieve. The CCP believes that the location of troops implementing the military reorganization plan should not be confused with local administration, and the issue of local political power has been clearly stipulated in the appendix to the Political Consultative Conference program, so it firmly rejected this demand that exceeded the scope of the ceasefire negotiations. At the beginning of the month, the five demands raised by the government authorities through Ambassador Stuart continued to increase, and the authorities took these demands \"as preconditions for a comprehensive ceasefire and negotiations on government reorganization.\"\n\n　　The government not only violated agreements on ceasefire, military reorganization, and restoration of transportation, but also overturned the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and Chairman Chiang's four promises long ago. Regarding the reorganization of the government, \"the government has consistently failed to agree on the number of committee members and the one-third veto power in accordance with the resolution, and in violation of the resolution, it wants the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee to select these committee members from other parties and non-party members.\" Also, \"regarding the National Assembly resolution, first because the government had not been reorganized, the draft constitution had not been reviewed, and it was inconvenient for all parties to submit a list of representatives, and later because the government side proposed increasing the number of representatives, the proportion of representatives was not agreed upon. As the May 5th deadline approached, the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group, under the convocation of Chairman Chiang, decided to postpone the National Assembly and explained that the date of the meeting would be determined after all parties had negotiated. Unexpectedly, on July 3rd, the government authorities announced on their own that the National Assembly would be held on November 12th of this year without consulting with the Political Consultative Conference, so the Political Consultative Conference resolution was completely swept away.\"\n\n　　The editorial pointed out: \"One of the main reasons why the Kuomintang dares to overturn the Political Consultative Conference is because the United States government provides them with assistance in any situation.\" The editorial then pointed out: \"General Marshall cannot but bear considerable responsibility on this issue, but it is not impossible for General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart to mediate successfully.\"\n\n　　The editorial finally analyzed the six guidelines proposed in Chairman Chiang's statement, pointing out that the aforementioned five demands are at its core: \"The core is that the war cannot be stopped unless the CCP withdraws from certain areas.\" The editorial clearly stated the CCP's attitude, saying: \"We always insist that the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be fully implemented, the Political Consultative Conference organization must continue to exist, and it should be allowed to negotiate government reorganization, review the final amendment to the constitution, agree on National Assembly representatives, and elect various committees with the participation of all parties. These matters can only be handled by the Political Consultative Conference.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 周恩来同志招待新闻界  重申停战实现政协决议  国民党敢于推翻政协乃因美国支持\n\n1946-08-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　周恩来同志招待新闻界\n    重申停战实现政协决议\n    国民党敢于推翻政协乃因美国支持\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】据中央社南京二十六日电：中共代表团于二十六日下午三时半招待新闻界，由周恩来主持。招待会中散发新华社所印群众周刊社论“立即无条件停战、实行政协决议”一文之提要，以作为中共对于时局之正式声明。该声明略称：八月二十五日上海出版之《群众》上，发表一篇针对蒋主席八月十四日文告的长篇社论，题为“立即无条件停战、实行政协决议”。我认为蒋主席的这一文告，不仅未能改变这种局势，而且更恶化这一局势，因为他所提出的停战条件，是要“中共部队撤出许多地区，并将当地民选政府取消，由国民党一党政府来接收”。社论指出政府当局如何推翻停战、政协、整军等协定，例如在一月停战协定宣布后，政府方面始终不实行东北停战，不接受马歇尔将军提议、并为中共所立即赞同的派遣执行小组到东北。后来虽有三月二十七日协议，得以派遣小组到东北，但政府方面却又违约拒绝停战，且在东北大打。直到六月休战，东北进攻暂稍和缓，而关内进攻又遍于黄河南北，国民党政府至今犹占据我解放区的县城五十九座，村庄三千多处。\n    在六月休战协商中，中共为力求达成和平愿望，在东北停战、恢复交通与整军问题等补充协议中，均已不惜作重大让步。可是在商谈中，政府当局曾无理的提出美方最后决定权问题………协议将成，政府忽又要求中共部队及地方民选政府须撤出苏北、胶济路沿线、热河承德以南及安东四处，否则四项协议不能签字，停战即难实现。中共认为实施整军方案的军队驻地，决不能与地方行政混为一谈，而地方政权问题，在政协纲领附记中已有明文规定，乃坚决拒绝这种超出休战协商项目的要求。月初政府当局经由司徒大使提出的五项要求，竟愈提愈多，当局并以这些要求“作为全面停战与商谈政府改组的先决条件”。\n    政府不仅破坏停战、整军及恢复交通等协议，而且早已推翻政协五项决议与蒋主席的四项诺言。关于改组政府，“政府对委员名额与三分之一的否决权，始终不依决议商定，而且违反决议，要在国民党中央常委会遴选这些其他党派与无党派的委员”。又如“关于国民大会决议，先因政府未曾改组、宪草审议未定、各方面未便提交代表名单，后因政府方面提议增加名额，致代表比例又未商安。及至五五期近，政协综合小组在蒋主席召集下，乃决定国大延期，并说明待各方商妥后，再定召开日期。不意七月三日，政府当局竟不经政协协商，迳自宣布本年十一月十二日召开国大，于是政协决议就扫地无余”。\n    社论指出：“国民党之所以敢于推翻政协，主要原因之一，是由于美国政府不论在任何情况下都给他们以帮助。”社论接着又指出：“在这个问题上，马歇尔将军不能不负相当责任，然而马歇尔将军与司徒雷登大使的调处，不是不可能成功的。”\n    社论最后分析蒋主席文告中所提出的六项方针，指出前述的五项要求是他的中心所在：“中心就是中共不撤出若干地区，战争就不能停止”。社论鲜明地说明了中共的态度，他说：“我们始终坚持政协五项决议必须全部实现，政协组织必须继续存在，允其协商政府改组，审定宪章最后修正案，商定国大代表，推定由各方人士参加的各种委员会等事，更非政协莫办。”"

Our reporter visited Mr. Rivington, the UNRRA representative, at the Bianfu (Border Government) Foreign Affairs Office on the evening of the 11th of this month. Mr. Rivington was chatting and relaxing with Mr. Roderick, UNRRA Special Inspector, and Mr. Li Jiaobin, representative of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration. Mr. Rivington spoke fluent Mandarin. The reporter's questions and Mr. Rivington's answers are as follows:\n    Question: \"UNRRA's relief work is often disrupted. What measures will UNRRA take?\" Answer: \"Three methods: (1) Make a sign for transportation to the Liberated Areas and (unclear code). (2) Report the bombing and strafing incidents to the Peiping Military Mediation Department, the National Government, and President Truman, requesting effective prevention. (3) If the above two methods are ineffective, and UNRRA is unable to work in the Communist areas as a result, then UNRRA's relief work in the Nationalist areas should also be temporarily withdrawn.\"\n    Question: \"The Nationalist Party detained the second batch of UNRRA relief supplies destined for the Liberated Areas in Yangzhou. What attitude has UNRRA expressed, and what remedial measures have been taken?\" Answer: \"UNRRA has reported this to Washington. However, the supplies detained in Yangzhou this time are not counted as part of the supplies due to the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Government. There are still more than 1,000 tons of supplies in Zhenjiang, ready to be transported to the Liberated Areas, but transportation is difficult and cannot be done quickly. This time I entered the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Areas, I also brought 350 tons.\"\n    Question: \"Who are the people to whom the Nationalist authorities are distributing the relief supplies, does the gentleman know?\" Answer: \"I have seen those political refugees receiving the supplies (reporter's note: i.e., the 'North Jiangsu refugees' propagandized by the Nationalists). They were well-dressed when they received the relief supplies, hired rickshaws to send people to receive them. They are not the people UNRRA wants to help. Gu Zhenggang even privately took 1,000 tons of supplies and gave them to these political refugees without going through anyone. We oppose this behavior, which violates the basic principles of the agreement between the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the National Government. This matter has been reported to Washington to oppose Gu Zhenggang's use of UN relief supplies as a weapon for political struggle. Because Mr. Gu's approach violates the principles of UNRRA's distribution of relief supplies.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国方迭次扣押运苏皖救资  联总代表答记者问\n\n1946-08-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国方迭次扣押运苏皖救资\n    联总代表答记者问\n    【新华社淮阴二十五日电】本社记者于本月十一日晚赴边府交际处访问联总代表瑞维廉氏，适瑞氏正与联总特派视察员罗德华、行总代表李绞缤诸氏纳凉漫谈，瑞氏操普通华语颇为流利，记者所提问题经瑞氏一一答复如下：问“联总救济工作常遭破坏，联总将有何措施？”答：“三个办法：（１）作一标志，向解放区运输及（电码不明）（２）将飞机轰炸扫射事件，告北平军调部、国民政府及杜鲁门总统请予有效制止。（３）如采用上列两种办法均无效果，联总将因此而不能在共产党区进行工作，则联总在国民党区救济工作亦应暂时撤回”。问：“国民党在扬州扣押联总运来解放区之第二批救济物资，联总曾表示过何种态度，采取何种补救办法？”答：“联总已报告华盛顿去了。不过此次扬州被扣押物资已不计算在应给苏皖边府物资之内，镇江现尚有一千余吨物资，准备运来解放区，因交通困难不能迅速运此，此次我进入苏皖解放区，亦带来三百五十吨。”问：“国民党当局将救济物资发给那些人，先生知道否？”答：“我曾看到那些领取物资的政治难民（记者按：即国民党宣传之“苏北难民”），他们领取救济物资的时候穿得很好，坐着黄包车派人来领取，他们不是联总所要救济的对象，而谷正纲居然私自拿去一千吨物资放给这些政治难民，没有通过任何人。我们反对这种违反联合国救济总署与国民政府协议的基本原则的行为。此事已经告给华盛顿，反对谷正纲用联合国救济物资来作政治斗争的武器。因为谷氏那种做法，是违反联总分配救济物资的原则”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: In the Li-Wen assassination case, which shocked the world, the Kuomintang authorities, after unilaterally handling the investigation and trial, executed the so-called Wen case culprits, Tang Shiliang and Li Wenshan, in Kunming on the 26th in an attempt to hastily conclude this bloody incident. Note: After the Li-Wen bloody incident occurred, the Kuomintang authorities, with a guilty conscience, openly rejected the reasonable proposal of the Democratic League to form a tripartite investigation committee composed of the government, the Democratic League, and the United States. Simultaneously, they arrested a large number of local people in Kunming, subjected them to severe torture, and attempted to extract confessions by coercion and frame others. Later, they implemented a \"sacrificial lamb\" tactic, detaining Tang Shiliang, the company commander of the Special Service Battalion of the Kunming Garrison Headquarters, and Li Wenshan, a platoon leader, and labeling them as \"Wen case culprits\" to hold a trial. Upon hearing this, the Democratic League specially sent Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin to Kunming to investigate and sent a letter to Gu Zhutong stating that \"After observing the Wen case, we found many doubts and request that a verdict not be made,\" while also requesting the authorities to publicly try the case. However, the Kuomintang authorities, fearing exposure, ignored the Democratic League's request and, with lightning speed, announced on the 26th that Tang and Li had been executed. At the same time, Gu Zhutong hosted reporters in Kunming, declaring that Tang and Li's assassination of Wen Yiduo was due to \"Wen Yiduo's insulting remarks about the government, which aroused righteous indignation among the soldiers,\" and expressed \"not without emotion\" for Tang and Li's suffering of extreme punishment. He also stated that \"I deeply hope that people across the country will not lightly destroy the hard-won country and give due care to the soldiers who shed blood in the war of resistance,\" as a pretext for continuing to assassinate democrats in the future. It is reported that Gu Zhutong told Liang Shuming that he hoped the Democratic League would consider the overall situation and not emphasize this matter further, attempting to conclude the bloody incident. Furthermore, under the pressure of national public opinion, the Kuomintang authorities have hypocritically dismissed Huo Kuizhang, the commander-in-chief of the Kunming Garrison. However, it is generally believed that in the near future, Huo Kuizhang will, like Guan Linzheng, the murderer of the \"December 1st\" bloody incident, return to the stage and be promoted.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党当局诡行“苦肉计”枪决所谓闻案凶犯  企图草草了结此一血案\n\n1946-08-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党当局诡行“苦肉计”\n    枪决所谓闻案凶犯\n    企图草草了结此一血案\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】震动中外的李闻被杀案，国民党当局在其一手包办调查审讯之后，已将所谓闻案凶犯汤时亮、李文山二人于廿六日在昆明执行枪决，以图草草了结此一血案。按：李闻血案发生后，国民党当局做贼心虚，公然拒绝民盟由政府、民盟及美国三方共组调查委员会的正当提议，同时即在昆明逮捕大批地方人士，酷刑拷打，企图屈打成招，嫁祸于人；后复实行“苦肉计”，将昆明警备司令部特务营连长汤时亮、排长李文山扣押，指为“闻案凶犯”，举行审讯。民盟闻讯，特派梁漱溟、周新民二氏赴昆调查，并致函顾祝同声明“观审闻案后，发现疑窦甚多，请勿定案”，同时要求当局将此案公开审讯。但国民党当局唯恐暴露马脚，不理民盟要求，并以迅雷不及掩耳之手段，于二十六日宣称已将汤、李二人执行枪决。与此同时，顾祝同在昆招待记者，声言汤、李之暗杀闻一多，系由于“闻一多辱骂政府，致军人激于义愤而起”，并对汤、李之身受极刑，表示“不无感慨”，且称“深盼全国人士对于艰难缔造之国家勿轻加毁辱，对于流血抗战之军人，给予应有之爱护”，以作今后继续暗杀民主人士之张本。据悉：顾祝同曾向梁漱溟表示，希望民盟顾全大局，对此勿再强调，企图就此了结血案。又在全国舆论压力之下，国民党当局已假惺惺的将昆明警备总司令霍揆彰撤职。惟一般咸信不久将来，霍揆彰定会如“一二一”血案的凶手关麟征一样，再行登台升官进爵。"

On the afternoon of the 24th, they advanced to the Xinfajie ×jiawopeng area north of Kangping. (2) The Chiang army in the Tieling, Faku, and Kangping areas is also attacking the defensive positions of the Democratic Allied Army stationed nearby. One battalion of Chiang's army, cavalry, police special detachments, and other forces totaling over 700 men occupying Dagushanzi, Faku, have been harassing the Democratic Allied Army for days. On August 17th, after a defensive counterattack and fierce fighting by the Allied Army, most of them were annihilated. Over 240 Chiang soldiers were killed, wounded, or laid down their arms. (3) Haicheng area: A unit of Chiang's army advanced towards the area east of Chaoqian River (20 li east of Haicheng) to Yangdianzi at 12:00 on the 13th, but was repelled by the Democratic Allied Army, with over 20 Chiang soldiers killed or wounded. Currently, the Chiang army in Shenyang, Changchun, and Jilin is frequently maneuvering, and Chiang's aircraft are also flying over various places for reconnaissance and harassment, and distributing provocative leaflets.

    "content": "Financial Market Since Currency Contraction\n    Wang Jingran\n    Since the Border Region Government ordered all levels of public and private banks to contract currency on July 15th, various branches of the Jinnan Bank have promptly deployed this work in order to quickly stabilize prices and benefit the people's livelihood. This action has been relatively swift. Except for the Jilu豫 (Jilu-Henan-Shandong) and Taiyue regions, which have not yet reported, the Jinnan and Taihang regions alone took action consistently across nine districts within eight days. Apart from Handan, which began deploying the contraction on the same day the Border Region Government issued the order (July 15th), the deployment times in other areas were: Feixiang, Xingtai, and Shexian on the 16th; Gaoyi on the 18th; Changzhi and Zuoquan on the 19th; Linxian on the 20th; Jiaozuo, Nangong, and Weixian on the 21st; and Xiajin, Linqing, and Hengshui on the 23rd (the above locations are where the bank's district branch offices are located). The first emergency measure for currency contraction was to freeze various deposits of all institutions in public and private banks and credit shops. All fixed deposits, current deposits, temporary deposits, and current account deposits that were not immediately needed were temporarily managed by the government and not allowed to be withdrawn. According to statistics from only nine locations, including Handan, Xingtai, Gaoyi, and Jiaozuo, the total was more than 20,000 million yuan, of which deposits in Jinnan Bank accounted for 56.6 percent, deposits in Ruihua Bank accounted for 17.15 percent, and deposits in various credit shops (only Handan and Xingtai included credit shops in the statistics) accounted for 25.25 percent. Regionally, Handan had the largest proportion at 60.63 percent, followed by Xingtai at 26.75 percent, and other locations accounted for 12.62 percent. What does this indicate? It indicates that finance is more concentrated in Handan.\n    The second method of currency contraction was to recover matured commercial loans. At that time, Handan, Xingtai, and other places had the following regulations: (1) Focus on recovering current loans first (especially those involving speculation), followed by term loans. (2) Recover from large merchants first, then small merchants (small merchants have a smaller role in the market). (3) Focus on recovering loans that have matured, and酌情 (zhuóqíng - use discretion) recover loans that have not yet matured. (4) For industries, handicrafts, cooperatives, agriculture, water conservancy, and transportation, loans would be recovered and issued simultaneously, while for commerce, loans would only be recovered and not issued. Based on these principles, many business cadres were assigned to urge repayments. The result was a considerable amount of repayments. According to preliminary statistics, the amounts of commercial loans recovered by Jinnan Bank in various places were: Handan recovered 152.75 million yuan within one month, accounting for 88 percent of the actual amount lent as of July 16th (same below); Xingtai recovered 19.8 million yuan within six days, accounting for more than 48 percent of the actual amount lent; Gaoyi recovered 6.8 million yuan within ten days, accounting for more than 97 percent of the actual amount lent; Changzhi recovered 13 million yuan within five days, accounting for 86.67 percent of the actual amount lent; Wu'an recovered 10 million yuan within 23 days, accounting for 83.33 percent of the actual amount lent; Jiaozuo (including counties in the Fourth District) recovered more than 16 million yuan within 14 days, accounting for 64 percent of the actual amount lent; and Weixian recovered 3 million yuan within 15 days, accounting for 75 percent of the actual amount lent. Other places such as Feixiang, Nangong, and Hengshui recovered a total of 3 million yuan, all of which was 100 percent of the amount they had actually lent. On average, within 13 days, for this commercial loan item alone, preliminary and extremely incomplete statistics from ten locations show that more than 122.03 million yuan was recovered, with 70 percent of the places completing more than 80 percent of the recovery task. In Handan alone, for nearly half the days between July 16th and July 31st, more than one million yuan of commercial loans were recovered daily, and during this time, loans were only issued to industry, handicrafts, and transportation, not to commerce. This demonstrates the concrete implementation of the policy of shifting commercial loans to production.\n    The third method of currency contraction was to not purchase and store large quantities of goods and to sell goods instead: (1) Major commercial firms and institutions producing goods sold off large quantities of goods, such as grain, salt, cotton, homespun cloth, and foreign cloth. This was carried out simultaneously in Handan, Xingtai, Wu'an, and other places, forcing prices down. (2) Public and private commercial firms stopped or reduced the purchase of goods. With major needs already resolved, public procurement tasks no longer involved large purchases, and private commercial firms also temporarily maintained the status quo due to their capacity being full and insufficient capital turnover. Furthermore, due to natural conditions (clear skies and abundant harvests) and news of military victories, the general supply of goods increased, further discouraging those who wanted to buy goods from acting. (3) In the past, merchants bought goods because of the severe imbalances in various regions, and they transported them back and forth. However, this time the contraction was a consistent effort. It was impossible to borrow money from banks, regardless of the location. Even if some money was available, they did not dare to act aggressively because the difference was not significant. In Handan, for example, funds were not only quite abundant in the past, but the scope of activities was also unusually broad. If goods bought from elsewhere could not be sold temporarily (they would not sell if the price was low), they could borrow from banks and credit shops. If they could not borrow from one bank, they could borrow from another. But now this is no longer possible. If the goods they bought could not be sold, they could not continue their activities. If they could not borrow from one bank, they would face the same situation at another. Therefore, for speculative merchants, this was undoubtedly a head-on blow.\n    Currency contraction has been in effect for a month now. In this month, significant progress has been made in stabilizing market prices in various parts of the border region. The prices of general goods have fallen sharply, and people's hearts have gradually settled down, saying that the government is truly working for the masses and truly has the power to do so. In the Taihang region, for example, comparing July 23rd with August 8th in Gaoyi, wheat fell from 1,200 yuan per斗 (dǒu - a unit of dry volume, about 10 liters) to 800-900 yuan, and cotton fell from 450 yuan per斤 (jīn - a unit of weight, about 500 grams) to 260 yuan. In Xingtai, comparing July 16th with July 20th, millet fell from 1,500 yuan per斗 to 1,230 yuan, wheat fell from 1,700 yuan per斗 to 1,500 yuan, and Sunshine brand cloth fell from 34,000 yuan per匹 (pǐ - a unit of length, about 5 meters) to 28,500 yuan. In Wu'an, comparing August 6th with August 7th, wheat fell from 31 yuan per斤 to 28 yuan, millet fell from 30 yuan per斤 to 26 yuan, salt fell from 100 yuan per斤 to 70 yuan, and homespun cloth fell from 1,000 yuan per斤 to 900 yuan. Similarly, in the Jinnan region, comparing July 16th with August 7th in Weixian, cotton fell from 500 yuan per斤 to 400 yuan, wheat fell from 1,000 yuan per斗 to 700 yuan, and homespun cloth fell from 150 yuan per double市尺 (shìchǐ - a unit of length, about 33.3 cm) to 100 yuan. Comparing July 16th with August 8th in Feixiang, homespun cloth fell from 130 yuan per double市尺 to 90 yuan, cotton fell from 550 yuan per斤 (plus three秤 - chèng, a traditional Chinese balance scale) to 480 yuan, wheat fell from 1,500 yuan per double市斗 to 1,200 yuan, and the degree of decline in millet was similar to that of wheat. Comparing July 20th with August 7th in Nangong, cotton fell from 700 yuan per斤 to 400 yuan, homespun cloth fell from 150 yuan per double市尺 to 110 yuan, millet fell from 70 yuan per斤 to 40 yuan, and wheat fell from 90 yuan per斤 to 70 yuan. Foreign exchange drafts fell from 4,100 yuan per 10,000 yuan to 3,340 yuan, and there were no buyers. Comparing before July 16th with August 6th in Hengshui, wheat fell from 850 yuan per斗 (15斤) to 750 yuan, the price of millet was slightly lower than wheat, but the degree of decline was the same, and salt fell from 72 yuan per斤 to 54 yuan. From the above materials, we can see the following issues: (1) Looking at several locations such as Gaoyi, Nangong, Feixiang, Weixian, and Hengshui, if we take the period around July 16th as the base of 100, then in the twenty days or so until around August 7th-8th, the average index of millet in three locations fell to 75.12, the average index of wheat in five locations fell to 77.37, the average index of homespun cloth in three locations fell to 76.41, and the average index of cotton in four locations fell to 70.55. Comparing these four prices, the downward trend is almost the same. If we had to find differences, the rate of decline in cotton and millet could be considered greater, and wheat and homespun cloth slightly less. (2) The price decreases were quite widespread geographically. There is currently no material to report from the Jilu豫 and Taiyue regions, but in the Jinnan and Taihang regions alone, prices fell uniformly within hundreds of miles from Hengshui and Nangong in the east to Changzhi in the west. This shows the organization in our efforts to stabilize prices. As long as we take appropriate countermeasures in a timely manner, prices will never rise as wildly as in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. (3) The price decreases were consistent for both industrial and agricultural products, but the degree of decrease was gradually decreasing. In the past, agricultural product prices often fell, but industrial product prices did not necessarily fall. Today is different: agricultural product prices fall, and industrial product prices fall as well, and the speed is not too drastic. On the one hand, this can avoid excessively large scissors differences between industrial and agricultural product prices and prevent farmers from suffering losses. On the other hand, it prevents industrial and handicraft workers from suffering losses when they purchase and store certain food and raw materials at high prices. That is to say, the consistent decline and gradual price decrease in industrial and agricultural products not only takes care of the farmers but also the industrial and handicraft workers, which is beneficial to the vast majority of the masses.\n    What can be seen from this currency contraction? (1) Public finance dominates urban financial activities. This can be seen from deposits and loans and from the supply and distribution of materials. To properly handle urban financial problems, we must carefully and meticulously handle public finance (i.e., public capital). This is the central key to financial problems and an important factor determining the development of industry and commerce. If not handled well, it will not only affect the development and prosperity of industry and commerce but also the people's lives. (2) The currency contraction work must have a core backbone, but it must not be carried out in isolation. It is difficult for one department to take action first, and it is difficult for a few locations acting alone to achieve the expected goals. In addition to considering mature internal and external conditions, there must also be arduous and detailed organizational work. Internal and external conditions include the situation of military and political struggles and the demands of the masses. Organizational work includes the consistent pace of various departments and regions, as well as rapid and timely communication and contact.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 收缩通货以来的金融市场\n王静然\n1946-08-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　收缩通货以来的金融市场\n    王静然\n    自七月十五日边府令各级公私银行收缩通货以后，各地冀南银行即及时布置这一工作，以求得物价很快稳定下来而利民生。这次的动作是比较迅速的。除冀鲁豫、太岳两区尚没有报告外，单就冀南、太行两区来说，前后不出八天功夫，冀南太行两行署区共九个分区，都一致动作起来。除邯郸于边府下令的当天（十五日）即布置紧缩外，其他各地布置紧缩的时间是：十六日肥乡、邢台、涉县，十八日高邑，十九日长治、左权，二十日林县，二十一日焦作、南宫、威县，二十三日夏津、临清、衡水（以上地点都系银行区分支行所住地）。收缩通货的第一个紧急措施是冻结各机关在公私银行银号的各种存款，凡属一时用不着而存入的定存、活存、暂存、往来存款等，统统由政府暂管不许提取。只根据邯郸、邢台、高邑、焦作等九个地方的统计有二万万元之多，其中存入冀南银行者占百分之五十六点六，存入瑞华银行的占十七点一五，存入各银号（只邯郸、邢台统计银号在内）的占百分之二十五点二五。如以地区来说，邯郸比例最大占百分六十点六三，邢台其次占百分之二十六点七五，其他地点占百分之十二点六二。这说明了一个什么问题呢？说明了邯郸的金融是较集中的。\n    收缩通货的第二个办法是收回到期商业放款，当时邯郸、邢台等地都有这样规定：（一）着重先收回活期放款（投机特别多），其次才是定期放款。（二）先收大商人后收小商人（小商人在市场起的作用究竟还小）。（三）着重收已到期者，酌情收不到期者。（四）其他工业、手工业、合作、农业、水利、运输是一面收一面放，惟商业是只收不放。根据这样原则，分配许多业务干部出去催收，结果催收数目是相当可观的。据初步统计各地冀南银行催收商贷的数目是：邯郸在一个月内催收一万万五千二百七十五万元占截止七月十六日实放数（以下同）的百分之八十八，邢台六天以内催收一千九百八十万元占实放数的百分之四十八强，高邑十天以内催收六百八十万，占实放数的百分之九十七强，长治五天以内催收一千三百万元，占实放数的百分之八十六点六七，武安二十三天以内催收了一千万元，占实放数的百分之八十三点三三，焦作（包括四分区各县在内）十四天内催收了一千六百余万，占实放数的百分之六十四，威县十五天内催收了三百万占实放数的百分之七十五。其他如肥乡、南宫、衡水三地共催收了三百万元，都是他们自己实放数的百分之百。总平均起来是十三天功夫，就这商业放款一项初步极不完全统计，十个地点即有一万万二千二百零三万余元之多，十分之七的地方催收任务完成了百分之八十以上。如以邯郸一地来说，自七月十六至七月三十一日的半月中，有将近一半的时间，每天收回一百万元以上的商贷，而在这个时间以内，是只放工业、手工业、运输业等而不放商业的。这说明收缩商贷转入生产政策的具体执行。\n    收缩通货的第三个办法是不大批购贮物资而且出售物资：（一）各大商号，机关生产大批抛售物资，如粮食、食盐、棉花、土布、洋布等，在邯郸、邢台、武安等地都同时进行，迫使物价下降。（二）公私商号停购少购货物。重大需用既已解决，公营采购任务便不大量购买，私营商号也因容纳量已满，资金周转不太充裕，而暂维持现状，再加上自然条件（天透雨丰收）及军事上的胜利消息，一般出手物资日益增多的情况下，更增加了要买货物者的裹足不前了。（三）过去商人买货，还因为各地严重的不平衡而捣来捣去，而这次的紧缩却是一致步调，到银行贷不出款，无论何地皆如此，即使有些款，也由于差额不太大而不敢放手去干了。以邯郸来说，过去一个时期，资金不仅相当充裕，而且活动范围异常之广，到别处买来货一时卖不了，（价低就不卖）即可到银行银号去贷款，甚至甲家贷不出到乙家去贷，而今不行了。买来货如不出手的话，即不能继续活动，甲家贷不出款，到乙家也同样，因此对投机商人来说，不啻是一个迎头打击。\n    收缩通货到现在已经一个月了，在这一个月内，对边区各地市场物价的平稳上有了显著的成效，一般物品之价格，都纷纷下跌下来，人心渐渐安定下来，说政府真正为群众办事，而且也真正有这个力量，如以太行区来说，高邑七月二十三日与八月八日相比，麦子每斗由一千二百元跌至八百至九百元，棉花每斤由四百五十元跌至二百六十元。邢台七月十六与七月二十相比小米每斗由一千五百元跌至一千二百卅元，麦子每斗由一千七百元跌至一千五百元，阳光市布每匹由三万四千元跌至二万八千五百元。武安八月六日与八月七日两天相比，麦子每斤由三十一元跌至二十八元，小米每斤由卅元跌至廿六元，食盐每斤由一百元跌至七十元，土布每斤由一千元跌至九百元。长治七月十九与七月二十五日相比，麦子由每斗一千五百元跌至五百元，小米由每斗一千元跌至四百元。另外在冀南区也同样，威县七月十六与八月七日相比，棉花由每斤五百元跌至四百元，麦子由每斗一千元跌至七百元，土布由每双市尺一百五十元跌至一百元。肥乡七月十六日与八月八日相比，土布每双市尺由一百三十元跌至九十元，棉花由每斤（加三秤）五百五十元跌至四百八十元，麦子每双市斗由一千五百元跌至一千二百元，小米跌的程度与小麦相差无几。南宫七月二十与八月七日相比，棉花每斤由七百元跌至四百元，土布每双市尺由一百五十元跌至一百十元，小米每斤由七十元跌至四十元，麦子每斤由九十元跌至七十元。外汇汇票每万元由四千一百元跌至三千三百四十元无人要。衡水七月十六日以前与八月六日相比，麦子每斗（十五斤）由八百五十元跌至七百五十元，小米之价比小麦略低，但跌的程度相同，盐每斤由七十二元跌至五十四元。从以上材料中可以看到以下几个问题：（一）从高邑、南宫、肥乡、威县、衡水等几个地点看起来，以七月十六前后相差不远的时间都作为一百基数计算的话，到八月七至八日前后二十来天，三个地点小米的平均指数下降至七五·一二，五个地点麦子的平均指数下降至七七·三七，三个地点土布的平均指数下降至七六·四一，四个地点棉花平均指数下降至七○·五五。就以这四种物价相比，下降指数差不多是一样趋势，勉强找差额的话，算以棉花小米下降速率较大，麦子土布略次。（二）各物跌价在地区上说是相当普遍的，冀鲁豫、太岳一时尚无材料报告，但就冀南、太行两区来说，东至衡水南宫，西至长治数百里之内，在一个时间一致下跌，这说明我们在平抑物价上的组织性，只要我们及时采取适当对策，物价是决不会如同国民党区汹汹上涨的。（三）物价跌价在工农业品上说是一致跌价的，而在程度上却又是渐趋下降趋势。过去往往是农产品跌价，工业品不一定跌价；今天不同了，农产品跌价，工业品也一样跌价，而且在速度上说都不是太猛烈。这一方面可以避免工农业产品剪刀差额过大，不使农民吃亏，另一方面，又不使在物价高时，工业手工业者购存一定食料原料而亏本。这就是说，工农业品一致下落并渐渐跌价，不仅照顾了农民，而且又照顾了工业手工业者，对广大群众是有利的。\n    从这次收缩通货中看出些什么问题呢？（一）城市金融活动是以公营金融占主要地位的，这从存放款中可以看出来，从吞吐物资中也可以看出来。要想很好处理城市金融问题，必须慎重详密的处理公营金融（即公营资本）问题，这是金融问题的中心关键，也是决定工商业发达与否的重要因素，处理不好，不仅会影响工商业的发达与繁荣，而且也有关人民生活。（二）收缩通货工作必须有核心骨干，但决不可孤立进行，一个部门先下手难以收效，少数地点单独进行也很难达到预期目的。除考虑内外各方面条件成熟之外，还须有艰苦详密的组织工作。内外条件包括军事政治斗争形势，及群众的要求等，组织工作上包括各部门各地区步调一致交通通讯连系的迅速与及时等。"

This indicates that if we want to avert civil war, we must adopt a new method of mediation. The current situation is even more precarious than it was when Japan first surrendered.

Moreover, with the participation of the Soviet Union, the final comprehensive agreement reached can satisfy both parties. Furthermore, the CCP harbors deep-seated fears of unilateral American bias. If the Soviet Union participates in the conference, these concerns can be dispelled. Great Britain should also participate in the mediation to further clarify the issues. In fact, this method of peacefully resolving problems is not new. The world powers have long adopted this method to resolve their complex and divergent issues.\" The editorial also stated: \"Regardless of the different viewpoints held by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain, it is a recognized fact that world peace should be promoted through frank and open consultation, rather than through violence, which can hardly achieve anything by chance.

After several days of dispute, the American representative, Brigadier General Barrett, personally met with Wang Zhonglian to discuss the matter. Wang agreed in writing, and at the team meeting on the 13th, the Kuomintang representative also formally agreed to lift the restrictions on the freedom of our representatives. Therefore, the team resolved to order the commanders of both sides to first restore the boundary line as of April 10th at midnight on the 17th, and then restore the positions as of January 13th, and scheduled the team to depart for inspection on the 18th and 19th. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 15th, Wang Zhonglian brazenly refused to fulfill his promise. In a public letter to American representative Brigadier General Barrett, he not only refused to lift all restrictions on our representatives, but also wanted to continue to strengthen the restrictions. Barrett was very indignant about this and immediately reported to the Beiping Executive Headquarters, pointing out: \"Chiang's army openly violated Order No. 7 reiterated by the Executive Headquarters, the conflict in northern Henan cannot be stopped, the team cannot exercise its functions, and the Kuomintang government should be fully responsible.\"\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Xianghe, 22nd] (Delayed) Before the 25th team departed for Xianghe, the agreement on \"ceasefire between the two sides during the investigation of the Anping incident\" had been shattered by the Kuomintang shells that exploded in Xianghe city. On the 21st, the team arrived in Xianghe. After a day of turbulence, just as they were preparing to rest, the 424th Regiment of the 142nd Division of Chiang's army, which occupied Wangmiao, suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Eighth Route Army's defense area in Mahetun at 11:00 p.m. that night, with gunfire and artillery fire continuing all night. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 22nd, while the team was holding a meeting to question witnesses to the Anping incident, Chiang's army, which occupied the Wangjia Bai area west of Xianghe, suddenly fired artillery shells at Xianghe city, and two shells exploded in the city. The chairman of the meeting, Communist representative Major General Huang Yifeng, immediately suggested stopping the questioning in order to protect the safety of the team members. American representative Major O'Malley also agreed, but Kuomintang representative Zhang Shuheng opposed the proposal. Major General Huang stated that the artillery fire endangered the safety of the team members and hindered the team's work, and the Kuomintang should be fully responsible for it. As of the time of this dispatch, the artillery fire from Chiang's army's attack was still continuing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋方违抗调处命令  新乡小组中共代表仍无自由  蒋军炮轰香河阻碍小组调查\n\n1946-08-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋方违抗调处命令\n    新乡小组中共代表仍无自由\n    蒋军炮轰香河阻碍小组调查\n    【本报焦作二十二日电】本月十日前后，新乡小组三方代表，正式接获北平执行部指令饬赴修武前线视察，监督恢复元月十三日国共两军位置，中共代表当即提出必须国方解除对我方代表自由之限制，始能谈到小组行使其职权。小组经数日之争议，美代表白瑞格亦亲与王仲廉面商，王并已书面答应，十三日小组开会时，国方代表亦正式答应允许解除对我代表自由之限制。因此小组决议命令双方指挥官于十七日午夜先恢复夏四月十日界线，而后恢复元月十三日位置，并定十八、十九两日小组出发视察。孰料十五日晚，王仲廉又悍然不执行诺言，在波致美代表白瑞格之公函中，不但不解除对我代表一切限制，反要继续加强其限制，白对此甚为愤懑，当即报告北平执行部，指出：“蒋军公然违反执行部重申之和字第七号命令，豫北冲突不能制止，小组不能行使职权，应由国民党政府方面完全负责。”\n    【新华社香河二十二日电】（迟到）二十五小组出发香河前，关于“在调查安平事件中双方停战”的协议，已为在香河城内爆炸之蒋军炮弹所粉碎。二十一日小组抵香河，经一日颠波，正拟休息，不料侵占王庙之蒋军一四二师四二四团，突于当晚十一时起向马合屯八路军防地猛攻，枪炮彻夜未停。二十二日下午五时许，当小组开会询问安平事件见证人之际，侵占香河西王家摆蒋军，突向香河城发炮，炮弹两枚在城内爆炸。会议主席中共代表黄逸峰少将为维护小组人员安全，当即建议停止询问，美代表马上校亦表赞同，惟蒋方代表张叔衡反对此议，黄少将当表示此项炮火危及小组人员安全及妨碍小组工作之进行，当由国民党方面负其全责。迄发电时为止，蒋军攻击的炮火，仍在继续中。"

    "content": "[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] A batch of relief supplies from the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), intended for northern Henan, arrived at the Handan Border Region Relief Association on August 7th. Upon inspection, it was discovered that some items were lost in transit. Originally, 180 packages of clothing were sent; after deducting 30 packages transported to the Hua County area (four counties), 150 packages were sent to the Handan Branch. These 150 packages were originally 15,386 pounds, but only 14,502 pounds remained upon inspection. Additionally, four packages were water damaged and expanded by 32 pounds, so the actual received weight was 14,534.5 pounds.\n\n　　Originally, 375 cases of milk were sent (48 cans per case, each can weighing 14.5 ounces). 63 cases were transported to the Hua County area. The number transported to the Handan Branch should have been 312 cases. However, only 294 cases and 11 cans were in good condition, 13 cases and 11 cans had rusty containers, 3 cases and 30 cans were spoiled, 37 cans were empty, and 7 cans were missing.\n\n　　The original shipment of medicine consisted of 12 cases of quinine (1,000 tablets per bottle), 36 bottles of Atabrine (100 tablets per bottle), 12 bottles of gentian pills (100 pills per bottle), 240 rolls of adhesive plaster, 60 packages of absorbent cotton, 12 dozen three-inch gauze bandages, 12 dozen four-inch gauze bandages, 12 rolls of thirty-six-inch gauze bandages, 60 small bars of soap, and 60 large bars of soap. However, the actual received quantities were 8 bottles of quinine, 33 bottles of Atabrine, 11 bottles of gentian pills, 237 rolls of adhesive plaster, 10 rolls of thirty-six-inch gauze bandages, 50 small bars of soap, and 52 large bars of soap. According to the person in charge of the branch, regardless of the reasons for the above shortages, the people of northern Henan should have received these supplies but did not. Therefore, it is hoped that the branch can replenish the missing supplies to the original amount.\n\n　　After completing the inventory on the 9th, the branch immediately allocated the actual received quantities reasonably. Specifically, 30 packages of clothing, 63 cases of milk, and 3 cases of medicine to the Hua County area; 12 packages of clothing, 2 bottles of Atabrine, 18 rolls of adhesive plaster, 1 package of absorbent cotton, 1 dozen three-inch gauze bandages, 1 dozen four-inch gauze bandages, 1 roll of thirty-six-inch gauze bandages, and 5 small bars of soap to Linzhang in southern Hebei; 24 packages of clothing, 50 cases of milk, and 2 cases of medicine (originally 12 portions, one portion per case) to Jiyuan and Meng Counties in the Taiyue Region. A total of 114 packages of clothing, 180 cases of milk, and 77 cases and 22 cans (including 13 cases and 11 cans with rusty containers, currently being inspected by doctors) to the fourteen counties of the Taihang Third and Fourth Special Districts. The remaining medicine, after distribution to the Hua County Special District and Linzhang, Jiyuan, and Meng counties, was entirely allocated to Taihang. However, due to rainstorms and damaged roads, the supplies cannot be transported to various places on time, and efforts are being made to transport and distribute them to the disaster victims.\n\n　　Furthermore, of the 25 counties in northern Henan, the counties more completely occupied by Chiang's troops are Xinxiang, Yuanwu, Fengqiu, and Yangwu. The complete counties within our liberated areas are Boai, Wenxian, Qinyang, Wu'an, Shexian, Linxian, Mengxian, Jiyuan, Huaxian, Junxian, Linzhang, and Neihuang, a total of twelve counties. Nine counties are partially occupied. The ratio is that the liberated areas occupy 70% of Anyang, 60% of Tangyin, 40% of Qixian, 50% of Jixian, 70% of Xiuwu, 30% of Huojia, 50% of Huixian, 50% of Wuzhi, and 60% of Yanjin. When the Henan Branch conducted emergency relief in early April, the principle of distributing supplies was that the county's share of relief supplies would be given to the side that controlled the county seat. As a result, only the twelve complete counties in the liberated areas received supplies, while the nine counties that were partially occupied were entirely given to Chiang's forces. The people of these nine counties in northern Henan are deeply dissatisfied. Our representative, entrusted by the disaster victims, went to the Henan Branch in Kaifeng to negotiate. After extensive discussions, the Henan Branch believed that the opinions expressed by our representative were completely reasonable, but the emergency relief period had passed and the amount of flour in storage was very small. Therefore, it was decided to provide the disaster victims in the liberated areas of northern Henan with 180 packages of used clothing, 18,000 cans of milk, and 12 cases of medicine as a supplementary distribution. Our representative, Comrade Gao Buqing, together with Mr. Liu Shumo and Mr. Qin Hansheng, representatives of the Henan Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, transported these supplies to Handan for redistribution to Wu'an.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 行总救济物资一部运邯  点收数目短少希按原数补足  豫北九县人民愤慨蒋方独吞救资\n\n1946-08-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　行总救济物资一部运邯\n    点收数目短少希按原数补足\n    豫北九县人民愤慨蒋方独吞救资\n    【本报特讯】行总河南分署救济豫北之物资一批，于八月七日运达邯郸边区救济分会进行点收时，发现路上损失一部，计原发来衣服一百八十包，除运滑县区四县三十包外，运邯郸分会之一百五十包，原为一万五千三百八十六磅，点收时仅余一万四千五百零二磅。另有四包因水湿涨出三十二磅，实收数为一万四千五百三十四磅半。\n    原发牛奶三百七十五箱（每箱四十八厅，每厅重十四盎斯半），运滑县区六十三箱，运邯郸分会者应为三百一十二箱，但内中好的为二百九十四箱十一厅，锈了桶子的十三箱十一厅，坏了的三箱三十厅，空的三十七厅，短少七厅。\n    药品十二箱原为奎宁十二瓶（每瓶千片），洋鼠理片三十六瓶（每瓶百片），龙胆丸十二瓶（每瓶百粒），胶皮二百四十卷，药棉六十包，三寸纱布十二打，四寸纱布十二打，三十六寸纱布十二卷，小块药皂六十块，大块药皂六十块，但实收到奎宁八瓶，洋鼠理片三十三瓶，龙胆丸十一瓶，胶布二百三十七卷，三十六寸纱布十卷，小块药皂五十块，大块药皂五十二块。据分会负责人表示：以上短少之物资不管其原因为何，但豫北人民是应该得到而没有得到，故希望分署能将短少之物资按原数补足。\n    分会于九日点收完毕后，立即按实收数合理分配，计滑县区衣服三十包、牛奶六十三箱、药品三箱、冀南之临漳衣服十二包、洋鼠理片两瓶、胶布十八卷、药棉一包、三寸纱布一打、四寸纱布一打、三十六寸纱布一卷、小块药皂五块、太岳区济源、孟县两县衣服二十四包、牛奶五十箱、药品两箱（原数为十二份每箱一份）。太行三四专区十四个县共衣服一百一十四包，牛奶一百八十箱，福利托儿所七十七箱二十二厅（内有锈桶十三箱十一厅、正由医生检查中），药品除分给滑县专署区及临漳、济源、孟县者外，余全数给与太行。但天雨成灾，道路冲坏，不能按时运往各地，现正积极设法运输发给灾民。\n    又讯：豫北共二十五个县，蒋军占领之较完整县为新乡、原武、封邱、阳武四县。我解放区内完整县为博爱、温县、沁阳、武安、涉县、林县、孟县、济源、滑县、浚县、临漳、内黄等十二个县，各占一部者为九个县，其比例计解放区占安阳百分之七十、汤阴百分之六十、淇县百分之四十、汲县百分之五十、修武百分之七十、获嘉百分之三十、辉县百分之五十、武陟百分之五十、延津百分之六十，当四月初河南分署进行急赈时之物资分配原则，为县城在那方面即将该县应得之救济物资交与那方面，因之解放区只十二个完整县得到物资，各占一部之九个县完全发给了蒋方，豫北九县人民深为不满。我方代表承灾民之托，前往开封河南分署进行交涉，经过多余商谈，河南分署方面认为我方代表所述意见完全合理，但急赈时期已过，面粉存数甚少，遂决定给豫北解放区灾民旧衣一百八十包，牛奶一万八千厅、药品十二箱，以示补发。我方代表高步青同志协同行总河南分署代表刘树模、秦汉生两氏，当将此物资运至邯郸，转武安分发云。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: The *Liberation Daily's* editorial \"Commentary on the Marshall-Stuart Joint Statement,\" published on the 14th, has resonated with all circles in Nanjing. According to a report in the *Shanghai United Evening News* on the 16th, the attention of everyone in Nanjing is now focused on reviewing America's policy towards China and the need to reaffirm it. They unanimously believe that even if the United States can shirk its role in mediating peace in China, it is difficult to shirk the actual supportive role it has played in China's civil war. One student said, \"The United States cannot completely shed its responsibility as a third party like other countries. If it wants peace in China, why doesn't it come up with effective solutions? If it wants to support China's civil war, why does it use empty negotiations to cover up the large-scale civil war that is underway nationwide?\" A female church worker believed that \"the biggest mistake is America's two-faced approach.\" A professor in his forties said angrily, \"The United States should formally reaffirm its commitment to stopping the Chinese civil war and implementing a democratic coalition government; otherwise, it should simply openly intervene in China's civil war with force.\" A pediatrician suggested, \"If it is truly impossible to mediate the China issue, the best solution is to withdraw all American forces in China and exit the vortex of the China problem.\" A bank clerk said, \"We hope that Marshall will not retreat at this point, and that the United States will no longer continue its ambiguous policy towards China, but will frankly and clearly review the past and effectively help China stop the civil war.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: Shanghai News: The *United Evening News* here carried a special dispatch from Nanjing on the 16th: \"'Autumn wind, autumn rain sadden people to death,' this is enough to describe the anxiety and distress of people in the capital recently regarding the current situation.\" Since Marshall and Stuart jointly issued a statement on the tenth of this month, admitting that their efforts to promote peace and unity in China had effectively failed, it was not until the 14th that Chairman Chiang issued a Victory Day message, and the *Yan'an Liberation Daily* also published an editorial on the 14th, commenting on the Marshall-Stuart joint statement. The reporter believes that these two documents are the most authoritative expressions representing the attitudes of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and deserve special attention, so he consulted authoritative observers here for their opinions. According to the observer, judging from these two documents, it can be seen that the severity of the current situation has reached its extreme. The observer pointed out that Chiang's message did not mention the Marshall-Stuart statement at all, nor did it pay any attention to Marshall's mission. From this, it can be seen that the government's confidence in resolving the problem independently and its interest in Marshall's mediation mission have been reduced to zero. As for the *Liberation Daily* editorial, it is the opposite, from beginning to end, it is almost entirely discussing the Marshall-Stuart statement and American policy. This may be sufficient evidence of the Communist Party's consistent realism. The editorial seems to have slight criticism of Marshall, but the main accusation is clearly focused on American policy, not Marshall personally. The newspaper believes that Marshall's failure was due to American policy. The newspaper also stated that even if Marshall returns to his country, he must give an explanation and cannot shirk his responsibility, because the Chinese people and the other two countries participating in the Moscow Three-Power Decision will not agree. At this point, the reporter became interested in the Moscow Three-Power Joint Declaration and asked the observer for his opinion. The observer believed that the Three-Power Declaration is indeed a historical document for clarifying and stabilizing the situation in the Far East. Since the declaration, the Soviet Union and Britain have largely been able to abide by it, for example, the Soviet troops in Northeast China withdrew as scheduled. The reporter then asked about Britain. He stood up and pointed to a Reuters telegram, saying: \"Chinese troops will no longer use Hong Kong as a transit country, because the Chinese civil war has expanded, and the British government, in order to maintain strict neutrality, does not want to provide Hong Kong for the Chinese army as a transit base...\" He believed that although this is an insignificant matter, the British willingness and spirit to avoid getting involved in the civil war is worth noting. However, the Moscow Three Powers include Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Even if the opinions of the Soviet Union and Britain are consistent, the United States can still exercise its veto power if it does not intend to modify its policy. Therefore, the main key at present lies in the United States, depending on whether the Chinese people and American public opinion can prompt the White House to change its policy towards China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放日报“评马司联合声明”得到南京各界共鸣  对美国两面作风咸表不满\n\n1946-08-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放日报“评马司联合声明”\n    得到南京各界共鸣\n    对美国两面作风咸表不满\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】延安解放日报十四日“评马司联合声明”的社论发表后，得到南京各界的共鸣。据十六日沪联合晚报报导：南京所有人的视线，现在都集中在美国对华政策的检讨和必须重新申明。他们一致认为，美国即使可以推卸调处中国和平的作用，也难推卸在中国内战中所起的实际支持作用。一个学生说：“美国是不能和其他国家一样完全以第三者的地位轻轻摆脱责任的，如要中国和平，为什么不拿出有效的办法？如要支持中国内战，为什么又用空洞的谈判来掩盖着正在进行的全国范围的大规模内战？”一个教会的妇女工作者，以为“最大的错误，是美国的两面作风”。一位四十多岁的教授气愤的说：“美国应该正式重新声明停止中国内战、实行民主的联合政府，否则就索性公然以武力干涉中国内战。”一个小儿科的医生提出：“如果真正是无法调处中国问题，最好的办法是撤退美国在华的一切势力，退出中国问题的漩涡。”一个银行职员说：“我们希望马司不就此退却，美国也不再继续过去那种暧昧不明的对华政策，而爽快明朗的检讨过去，重新有效的帮助中国停止内战。”\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】沪讯：此间联合晚报载南京十六日专电：“秋风秋雨愁煞人”，此足为最近首都人士对时局焦灼苦虑之写照。自本月十日马歇尔、司徒雷登两氏发表联合声明，承认其促成中国和平与团结之努力已实际失败后，直至十四日，始由蒋主席发表胜利纪念日文告书，延安解放日报亦于十四日发表社论，评论马司联合声明。记者以此两文件，为最足代表国共两方态度的权威表示，殊足重视，特将以询此间权威观察家之意见。据该观察家称：就此两文件观之，可知时局严重实已达于极点。该观察家指出：蒋主席文告中对马司声明只字未提，对马司任务亦未加致意，由此殆可见政府之单独解决问题之自信，而对马帅调解任务之兴趣已减低至于零点。至于解放日报社论，则恰与之相反，从头至尾，几全在申论马司声明及美国之政策，此或足为共产党人素主现实主义之一证。该社论对马帅似有微辞，但主要指责显然集中于美国政策，而非马帅个人。该报认为马帅之失败，乃由于美国政策所致。该报又表示马帅即使返国，亦必得有个交待，不能推卸责任，因中国人民及参加莫斯科三强决定的其他两国亦不会答应。谈至此，记者对莫斯科三强联合声明问题发生了兴趣，当又向该氏征询意见，该氏认为三强声明确不失为澄清与安定远东局势之历史文件，自该项声明以来，苏英两国大体上都能遵守，例如东北苏军如期撤退了。记者又询以英国如何？他站起来指着路透社的一个电讯说：“中国军队将不再以香港为转运国，盖因中国内战扩大，英国政府为保持严格中立起见，不欲以香港供华军作为转运基地……。”他认为此虽一不足道的小事，但英国避免卷入内战的意愿及精神，却值得注意。不过莫斯科三强是包括英美苏三国的，苏英的意见即使一致了，美国如果无意修改其政策，仍可行使否决权。故目前主要的关键，还是在于美国，要看中国人民及美国的舆论能否促使白宫改变其对华政策。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: Today, the Liberation Daily published an editorial entitled \"Enriching Our Material Foundation.\" The editorial first mentioned the bumper harvest of summer wheat in various liberated areas this year. Wheat production on the mountains increased by 900 million jin. In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region, Jicheng County alone increased production by 93,000 shi compared to last year. In the Su-Wan border region, Huaiyin County's yield per mu was 150 to 300 jin. This bumper harvest is of great significance for winning the self-defense war, enabling the military and civilians in the liberated areas not only to have enough to eat but also to live a better life. The editorial then discussed the reasons for the bumper harvest in the liberated areas: Favorable weather conditions were indeed an important factor, but the more important factors were: (1) Farmers' enthusiasm for production was increased after the anti-traitor liquidation and rent reduction and interest reduction movement. (2) The governments of the liberated areas not only abolished exorbitant taxes and eliminated bandits, but also issued large amounts of agricultural loans (such as 370,000,000 yuan issued in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region) to solve farmers' difficulties with plowing cattle, seeds, and farm implements, and led the people to build water conservancy projects, dig wells, and repair canals, benefiting approximately 30 million mu of land throughout the liberated areas. On the occasion of celebrating the summer wheat harvest, the editorial specifically put forward the following tasks: (1) Protect the harvested grain and prevent the reactionaries from snatching a single grain. (2) Organize the labor force in a planned way and speed up the preparation for all autumn harvest work in order to strive for a full-year harvest. In Su-Wan, Ji-Zhong, and other places, it is necessary to prevent floods. (3) Ensure a bumper harvest of cotton fields and promote spinning yarn in every household and weaving cloth in every village. Finally, the editorial emphasized that in order to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, we must enrich our material foundation, strive for production, and achieve complete self-sufficiency in all daily necessities; at the same time, we must make long-term plans, save manpower and material resources, and avoid waste, so that the 140 million people in the liberated areas can still improve productivity and improve their lives in the self-defense war, in order to win the final victory of the self-defense war.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: This year, the wheat harvest in various liberated areas is generally abundant, and the autumn harvest is also expected to be abundant. Wheat production in the Shandong Liberated Area increased by 900 million jin. The average yield per mu in the Bohai and Binhai areas was 140 jin. The harvest in the Jiaodong and Luzhong areas also increased by 200 million jin compared to last year. Jizhong Plain, a famous wheat warehouse in Hebei, planted 8.95 million mu of wheat this year. If the average harvest per mu is 7 dou, its 8 million people can get 7 dou per person. In 13 counties including Leting and Fengrun in eastern Hebei, wheat fields reached more than 1 million mu, with some yielding more than 1 shi per mu. As for the autumn crops in the liberated areas, they are also generally thriving. The ears of autumn crops in various parts of Shandong are full and plump, and the harvest scene is unprecedented in the past decade. On the Tai (an) Lai (wu) Plain, a famous millet producing area, the grain is five to six feet tall, and the ears are more than a foot long. It is estimated that each large mu (960 square steps) can harvest 2,000 jin of millet; corn and sorghum can also produce 1,000 jin. In Yishan District and various parts of Bohai, the ears of grain are three fingers longer than last year, and the ears of sorghum are also two fingers longer. In Kedong, Baiquan, Keshan and other counties in Beihai, Northeast, experienced veteran farmers said that this year, the minimum yield of millet per hectare is 3 shi, an increase of two times compared to last year's 1 shi per hectare; corn can also yield 5 shi normally this year, and potatoes can yield 12,000 jin (20 shi). Now, in the vast fields of Beigou, which has not been liberated for long, soybeans have partially bloomed, corn has produced red tassels, and millet is also more than two feet tall, all presenting a scene of bumper harvest. Now farmers in various places are full of joy, preparing farm tools to welcome the autumn harvest. In the Taiyue area of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border region, the average yield of more than 10 million mu of wheat fields is 8 dou to 1 shi per mu (14 jin per dou). Yicheng County increased production by 93,000 shi compared to last year. In the newly liberated areas of southern Hebei, Xiajin, Qinghe, Enxian, Gucheng and the eight counties of Pingyuan, a total of more than 870,000 mu of wheat fields were planted, harvesting more than 87 million dou, an increase of more than 30 million jin compared to last year.

When they reached the last major pillbox, the enemy resisted fiercely. He personally led the engineers to plant explosives. In the darkness, it was difficult to see clearly. The first time, they found a hole and were about to place the explosives when a grenade was thrown out of the hole. The second time, they found another spot, but it turned out to be the enemy's machine gun firing port, and they were driven back again. The third time, they finally found the enemy's rifle firing port, planted the explosives, and collapsed half of the enemy's pillbox. The enemy continued to fire guns and throw grenades desperately. Comrade Wang Huaiyu, with great agility, felt his way along the base of the wall and approached the pillbox, throwing several volleys of grenades, which posed a serious threat to the enemy, and the enemy stopped firing. We took the opportunity to shout through the prisoners. At this time, Comrade Wang Huaiyu had already climbed onto the major pillbox, and the enemy all surrendered their weapons. He single-handedly carried down two machine guns.\n\n　　　　Fellow Villagers Urge Each Other to Lay Down Their Arms\n\n　　In the self-defense battle against Chiang Kai-shek's troops at Yejigang Station, when the battle began on the morning of the 11th, our army captured three pillboxes north of the road in one fell swoop, capturing Ge Jin, the captain of the security team, and more than twenty others. Yang Wanyu, the deputy captain of the security brigade, led his troops to stubbornly resist in the large pillbox south of the road. Comrade Zhou Desheng, the company commander of a certain company, discovered that Ge Jin was from Anhui, and Comrade Zhang Xiao discovered that another prisoner was from Shandong and a fellow villager. They used their fellow villager relationship to kindly explain the great righteousness to them. They were deeply moved and voluntarily followed our army to the pillbox south of the road to shout, denouncing the crimes of being used by Chiang Kai-shek to carry out a treasonous civil war, and persuading them to withdraw from the civil war and lay down their arms. At the same time, in light of their tragic treatment, they exposed Chiang Kai-shek's shady practices of excluding miscellaneous troops. The soldiers in the pillbox cried loudly when they heard this, and were unwilling to fight any longer. Yang Wanyu had no choice but to lay down his arms along with them. As a result, Yejigang Station was completely restored to freedom. Company Commander Zhou Desheng simply counted: In this battle, more than sixty Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were tragically sacrificed for nothing, more than one hundred laid down their arms, and five machine guns and more than one hundred rifles were captured. The reactionary ringleader Chiang Kai-shek's Henan Security Regiment Second Regiment, Second Battalion, collapsed in this way.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 野鸡岗战斗故事\n\n1946-08-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　野鸡岗战斗故事\n          王怀玉连长奋不顾身\n    反击野鸡岗车站蒋军时，我军副连长王怀玉同志，亲自带着突击组上去打碉堡，一面冲一面打手榴弹，一连突下了好几个碉堡。到最后一个大碉堡，敌人抵抗很凶，他又亲自带着工兵去安炸药。黑夜里看不很清，第一次找到一个洞，正要放炸药，不料洞里丢了一个手榴弹。第二次又找到一个地方，却是敌人的机枪枪眼，又被敌人打了回来。第三次才找到敌人步枪枪眼，安好炸药，把敌人碉堡炸坍了一半，敌人还拚命打枪，打手榴弹，王怀玉同志又很机动地沿着墙根摸过去接近了碉堡，一连打了好几排手榴弹，给了敌人严重威胁，敌人才停止打枪。我们利用俘虏乘机喊话，这时王怀玉同志已经上了大碉堡，敌人全部缴械，他一下扛了两挺机枪下来。\n            同乡喊同乡放下武器\n    在野鸡岗车站反击蒋军的自卫作战中，当十一日晨战斗开始，我军一举攻克路北三个碉堡，俘保安队中队长葛进等二十余人。保安大队副杨万玉，却带领所部坚守路南大碉堡顽抗。某连连长周德胜同志，发现葛进是安徽人，和他同乡张绡一同志发现另一个俘虏是山东人和他同乡，就以同乡关系，亲切地晓以大义，他们甚为感动，乃自动随我军到路南碉堡去喊话，痛陈受蒋介石利用进行卖国内战之罪行，劝他们退出内战放下武器，同时针对着他们悲楚的待遇，揭露蒋介石排斥杂牌的黑幕。碉堡里的士兵们听了大声痛哭起来，都不愿再打了，杨万玉只好跟着他们一齐放下武器，于是野鸡岗车站乃全部恢复自由，周德胜连长简单数了一下：这次战斗里，惨遭无谓牺牲的蒋军六十多名，放下武器的一百多，缴获机枪五挺，步枪一百多枝，反动头子蒋介石河南保安团第二团第二大队，就这样垮台了。"

It is reported that in recent days, passenger trains on the Longhai, Pinghan, Xinbian, and Jinpu lines have been suspended and are being used exclusively to transport troops. The main forces of the Chiang army on the Longhai front, namely the two brigades of Chen Zongqiao's 41st Division, one brigade of Chen Dingxun's 47th Division, and two brigades of Zhao Xitian's Reorganized 3rd Division, which were originally pursuing our Li Xiannian's troops in the Longjuzhai area, were all transferred east around ten days ago and have now arrived at the front to join the battle, advancing in three routes, and have successively occupied our Sanyizhai, Luowang Station, and Lanfeng City. The 311th Brigade of its Reorganized 3rd Division is advancing from Changyuan towards the north of Kaocheng, attempting to attack our Dongming City, and is simultaneously coordinating with the 49th Brigade of the 27th Army on the Pinghan Line in Northern Henan, as well as the puppet troops of Sun Dianying and Cheng Daosheng, attempting to occupy our Junxian area, and has already occupied our Wulingji in Tangyin. The 40th Army, originally stationed in Anyang, is attacking westward and has already occupied our Qugou Town. The 18th Brigade of the 18th Division and the notoriously known surrendered enemy general Fang Xianjue's 81st Division, advancing west from Xuzhou, are cooperating with local bandits Geng Jixun and the Northern Jiangsu Security Brigade, and on the 19th, separately occupied our Dangshan and Peixian. Our district's military and civilians are separately engaging in resistance, with fierce fighting underway on all fronts. In summary, the Chiang army's intention is to reoccupy the area along the Longhai Railway and launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas north and south of the railway. Our border region's soldiers and militia are standing ready, preparing to give the invading army a devastating blow at any time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陇海蒋军妄图继续进攻 自卫我军严阵以待\n\n1946-08-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陇海蒋军妄图继续进攻\n    自卫我军严阵以待\n    【本报邯郸二十七日电】陇海自卫反击战，我军获胜，歼灭蒋军一万六千余，收复县城五座、车站十二个、控制三百八十里铁路线，予蒋军进攻体系以严重打击，使蒋介石手忙脚乱，急调预定由武汉、豫南、鄂西、陕南、淮南等战场抽调之兵力，迅速增至陇海前线，以图更大规模的向我陇海路两侧解放区继续进攻。据悉：连日陇海、平汉、新汴、津浦各线之客车均已停开，专门用来运兵。在陇海方面蒋军之主力部队，为原在龙驹寨一带追击我李先念部队四十一师陈宗樵两个旅、四十七陈鼎师勋一个旅及整三师赵锡田两个旅，均于十日前后东调，现已到达前线加入作战，分三路前进，已先后占我三义寨、罗王车站及兰封城。其整三师三百一十一旅则由长垣向考城以北推进，企图进攻我东明城，同时并配合以平汉线豫北之二十七军四十九旅及伪军孙殿英、程道生部，企图占我浚县地区，刻已占我汤阴之五陵集。原驻安阳之第四十军则向西进攻，并已占我曲沟镇。由徐州西犯之十八师十八旅及臭名远扬之降敌名将八十一师方先觉部，配合土顽耿继勋、苏北保安旅，十九日分别进占我砀山沛县。我区军民分头迎击，各线正在激战中。综观蒋军意图，在于重新占领陇海路沿线，并向铁路南北解放区作大规模的进攻，我边区子弟兵和民兵正严阵以待，准备随时给予进犯军以歼灭性的打击。"

The original telegram is as follows: \"To the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, and all American people: In her public statement in Shanghai on July 22nd, Madame Sun Yat-sen sternly exposed and denounced the Kuomintang right-wing's instigation of civil war, which is deepening the disaster for the Chinese people and endangering world peace, as well as the presence of U.S. troops in China and U.S. military aid to the Chinese civil war. She put forward correct proposals to save this crisis, believing that it is necessary to end the dictatorship and form a united government of all parties in the country. This represents the opinions and demands of the Chinese people. In addition to strengthening the unity of the Chinese people, supporting Madame Sun Yat-sen's proposals, stopping the civil war, and realizing a peaceful and democratic coalition government, we also appeal to you to urge your government, in the spirit of the American people's fine tradition of independence, peace, and democracy, to immediately realize the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China and stop military aid to China. This would be your greatest friendship and assistance, sufficient to accelerate the completion of China's peaceful, democratic, and unified situation. At the same time, it can enable the Chinese people to engage in the construction of industrial, commercial, educational, and cultural undertakings. We firmly believe that you, with Christian charity and your deep friendship with us, will actively and willingly see the Chinese people escape the sea of war and move towards a new life, and will be even more willing to see long-term friendly cooperation between China and the United States, advancing towards a world of peace and prosperity. Rapid and powerful assistance to China will allow China, in a peaceful and happy life, to fully appreciate your gratitude.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 27th: Moscow, August 26th broadcast: Shanghai students sent a telegram to the International Student Congress, requesting that the Chinese peace issue be included on the agenda, and demanding that U.S. troops withdraw from China and that military aid to the Chinese government be stopped.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 香港民主人士电美国会  促请美军离华停止援蒋\n\n1946-08-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　香港民主人士电美国会\n    促请美军离华停止援蒋\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】香港讯：此间作家黄药眠、名教授家陈此生等，为响应孙夫人的声明，除通电全国呼吁制止内战、实现民主的联合政府外，并致电美国参众两院及美国人民，请求督促美政府立即撤退驻华美军，停止军事援助。原电如下：“美国参众两院暨全美国人民：七月二十二日孙逸仙夫人在上海公开谈话，对于中国右派策动内战，加深中国人民灾祸，危及世界和平，和美军驻华及美国军火援助中国内战之情况，曾严正揭发指斥，并提出挽救此种危机之正确主张，认为必须结束独裁，组成全国各党派一致的联合政府。这是代表其中国人民的意见和要求，我们除了加紧团结中国人民，拥护孙逸仙夫人的主张，制止内战，实现和平民主的联合政府外，并向你们呼吁，请你们本着美国人民优良传统的独立和平民主精神，督促你们的政府立即实现撤退驻华美军，停止对华军事援助，这就是你们最大的友谊与援助，足以加速完成中国和平民主统一的局面，同时可以使中国人民从事工商与教育文化事业之建设。我们深信你们以基督教的博爱及对我深厚的友谊，当积极愿意看见中国人民脱离战争苦海而走向新生，更愿意看见中美长期友好合作，向和平繁荣世界前进。而迅速加以有力援助的中国，将在和平愉快生活中，充分感激你们的。”\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】莫斯科二十六日广播：上海学生致电国际学生代表大会，要求将中国和平问题列入议事日程，并要求美军撤出中国，停止以军事援助中国政府。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: Moscow today broadcast: Commentator Masinu commented: In the year since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, China's civil war has developed to an unprecedented scale, the war in Indonesia has intensified, and the civil war in the Philippines has also been increasing. The reason for all this is, as Marshal Tito said at the Metallurgical Workers' Congress on August 19: \"In this great war, some countries that fought alongside us are unwilling for us to obtain a just peace, but want us to accept an imperialist peace.\" It was emphasized during the war that the last remnants of fascism and militarism must be eliminated, but in the past year, the policy implemented in Japan has been a policy of reviving Japanese reactionary forces. Under MacArthur's instigation, Japanese democratic forces have been destroyed. If this continues, in ten or twenty years, aggressive forces will undoubtedly raise their heads and become a threat to universal peace. However, consolidating peace in the Far East depends not only on the control of Japan, but also on giving freedom and independence to colonial countries and carrying out democratic reforms. The oppression of colonial independence movements is creating favorable conditions for the revival of Japanese aggressive forces. All the promises made by the Allies during the war regarding allowing colonies to achieve national liberation and democratization have not been fulfilled. In Indonesia, British and Dutch troops, with the help of the Japanese army, destroyed all people's organizations; in the Philippines, the United States is carrying out armed intervention, helping reactionaries and traitors against patriotic people. American artillery is bombarding the Filipino people. The United States is also adopting the methods used in the Philippines in China, carrying out armed intervention. A British magazine reporter said: If democracy triumphs in China, then democratic forces will also triumph in Annam, Siam, Malaya, India, and even in Japan. This shows that it is natural for fascism and imperialism to try to hinder this development. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the struggle of people of all countries for national independence, peace and democracy has just begun. Therefore, the Potsdam Declaration on the elimination of Japanese imperialism and the Moscow Conference resolution on the China issue are of particularly important significance. The Moscow Conference resolution on China stipulates the establishment of a coalition government, cessation of civil war, implementation of democratic reforms, and a tripartite agreement not to interfere in China's internal affairs. The Soviet Union has been and is faithful to this resolution. Undoubtedly, other countries, especially the United States, have not yet implemented this resolution. The withdrawal of US troops from China will promote the establishment of peace in the Far East.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: TASS, New York: Editor Baddovi of the afternoon newspaper criticized the foreign policy of the United States in an editorial he wrote. Baddovi wrote: China is one of the regions that must be adjusted. Our China policy has made a huge mistake. Our representatives in China, General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, have admitted their failure. In order to support a corrupt and autocratic regime in China that cannot gain national support and cannot maintain order, we are transporting troops, money, and supplies to China. But all this is a waste of effort. Not only do many Chinese wish Americans to leave China, but even our own sailors, miners, and railroad employees are also tired of the domestic political situation in China and wonder what is keeping them in China. The failure of our China policy shows that our unchanging anti-Soviet policy in some regions is completely impractical. We must remember that the border between the Soviet Union and China stretches for thousands of miles, so the Soviet Union naturally pays attention to the events that occur on the other side of this border, just as we pay attention to Canada. We support Chiang Kai-shek because we want to turn China into an anti-Soviet base for the United States. Baddovi criticized the guiding principles of American foreign policy, saying: \"Our recent note to Poland and the Soviet Union, coupled with our interference in China and the continued creation of chaos there, have clearly demonstrated the nature of our foreign policy. This policy can be judged in the current situation and is clearly based on the following guiding principles: on all issues, in all important regions, adopt a tough policy towards the Soviet Union. The tripartite unity that Roosevelt strived to achieve for long-term cooperation is being split. In order to achieve international stability, we must re-examine our current 'should be tougher' policy and the 'toughness' of what we call policy.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 马西努批评美国外交政策  纵容反动派威胁和平  应依莫斯科决议撤退驻华美军\n\n1946-08-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　马西努批评美国外交政策\n    纵容反动派威胁和平\n    应依莫斯科决议撤退驻华美军\n    【新华社延安廿七日电】莫斯科今日广播：评论员马西努评论：日寇投降以来的一年中，中国的内战已发展到空前未有的规模，印尼的战争在激烈化，菲律宾内战也日益加强起来。这一切的原因，正如八月十九日铁托元帅在冶金工人大会上所说的：“在此次大战中，有些与我们并肩作战的国家不愿意我们获得正义和平，而要我们接受帝国主义和平。”还在战时就已着重指出，必须消灭法西斯主义与军国主义的最后残余，但最近一年来，在日本实行的政策，是使日本反动势力复活的政策。在麦克阿瑟怂恿之下，日本民主力量已受到摧残，假使这样继续下去，经过十年二十年，无疑地侵略势力会抬起头来，成为普遍和平的威胁。但是，巩固远东和平不仅依赖对日的管制，而且依赖给予各殖民地国家以自由独立，并进行民主改革。对殖民地独立运动的压迫，正是替日本侵略势力的复活造成良好的条件。战时盟国关于准许殖民地获得民族解放与民主化的一切诺言都未实现。在印尼，英荷军在日军帮助下，摧毁一切人民的组织；在菲律宾，美国正实行武装干涉，帮助反动派与叛徒反对爱国志士。美国的大炮轰击菲律宾人民，美国在中国也是采用在菲岛的方法，实行武装干涉。英国一杂志记者说：假使民主在中国胜利，那末民主势力在安南、暹逻、马来亚、印度，甚至在日本也会取得胜利。这就说明法西斯主义与帝国主义企图妨碍此种发展是很自然的。日寇投降后，各国人民争取民族独立与和平民主的斗争才刚刚开始，因此波茨顿会议关于消灭日本帝国主义的宣言，莫斯科会议关于中国问题的决议，是有特别重要的意义。莫斯科会议关于中国的决议，规定建立联合政府，停止内战，实行民主改革，及三国相约不干涉中国内政。苏联在过去与现在，都是忠实于这个决议，无疑其他国家、首先是美国还未执行这一决议，美军从中国撤退，将会促进建立远东和平。\n    【新华社延安二十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：下午报编辑巴多维在其所撰社论中，批评美国的对外政策。巴氏写道：中国是必须调整的地区之一，我们的对华政策犯了绝大的错误，我们的驻华代表马歇尔将军与司徒雷登大使，已承认他们的失败。为了支持中国一个不能得到全国拥护、不能维持秩序的腐败专制的政权，我们正把军队、金钱与供应品运往中国。但是这一切都是白费气力，不仅许多中国人愿望美国人离开中国，而且甚至我们自己的水兵、矿工与铁路员工对于中国国内政治局势也表示厌烦，并且诧异什么事情使他们留在中国？我们对华政策的失败，表明我们在某些区域不变的反苏政策是毫不实际的。我们必须记得，苏联与中国的边界绵延数千里，因此苏联很自然地注意这一边界彼方所发生的事变，亦如我们注意加拿大的同样现象那样。我们支持蒋介石，是因为我们想把中国变为美国的反苏基地。巴氏批评美国对外政策的领导原则说：“我们最近致波兰及苏联的通牒，加上我们干涉中国及在那儿继续造成混乱状态，已清楚表明了我们对外政策的性质，这一政策在目前情况下可加以判断，很明显的是基于下述指导原则：在一切问题上，在一切重要地区，对苏联采取强硬政策，罗斯福力谋取得长期合作的三强团结，正在被分裂。为了达到国际稳定，我们必须重新审查我们现在“应该更强硬的”政策及我们所称为政策的“强硬”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th: Shanghai News: The Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference, including more than fifty people's organizations from all walks of life, and the National Peace Movement Conference, recently issued a \"Declaration of Freedom Guarantee,\" stating first: Our victorious country, listed in the democratic camp, does not even have the basic freedom that people in ordinary democratic countries should have. Even groups and individuals engaged in the democratic movement are being subjected to unreasonable and illegal oppression, humiliation, and massacre. Since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, there have been constant atrocities and tragedies against the Political Consultative Conference, against peace, and against democracy, which have negated the promises announced by the Kuomintang authorities themselves with facts, and violated the agreements they themselves agreed to. It is tantamount to announcing the bankruptcy of its own political credibility in front of the people. Anyone without prejudice can see clearly that the series of atrocities and tragedies from the Jiaochangkou Incident to the murder of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were all instructed (explicitly or implicitly) by the Kuomintang authorities, or at least encouraged or condoned by the Kuomintang authorities. The Kuomintang and its government cannot escape their due responsibilities. The declaration pointed out: The basic content of democratic politics is that the people must have the basic freedoms of body, speech, publication, assembly, and association. Without these freedoms, the people are slaves. The declaration strongly stated: The reason why the Chinese people have continued the revolution for fifty years and the War of Resistance Against Japan for eight years, advancing wave upon wave, without hesitation, is to be masters and not slaves anymore. The Chinese people are unwilling to be slaves of the Qing Empire and the Northern Warlords, and they are unwilling to be slaves of Japanese imperialism, and naturally, they are unwilling to be slaves of today's reactionary groups. Whoever wants to force the Chinese people to be slaves again, the Chinese people must fight to the end with them. The declaration finally called on to mobilize the power of the people of the whole country to unanimously demand that the government immediately implement the following matters: (1) Stop the all-out civil war and restore peace; (2) Fulfill the four promises and earnestly guarantee the people's freedom; (3) Implement the five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan, establish a democratic coalition government, convene a democratic National Assembly, and formulate a democratic constitution; (4) Abolish all secret service organizations; (5) All parties jointly organize an investigation committee to thoroughly investigate the truth of all atrocities and tragedies since the Jiaochangkou Incident, severely punish the culprits or murderers, and punish the responsible public security authorities; (6) Comfort all the dead and compensate all the injured for medical expenses and other losses; (7) Release all political prisoners.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: According to the Associated Press, one year after Japan's surrender, China is still marked as a conquered country. The people are panicked, disappointed, and scattered. The economic situation is chaotic, the national treasury is empty, the country continues to suffer from war devastation and division, and the people cannot travel freely within a vast territory. Large areas are still tightly blocked, and floods, famines, and fear permeate the entire country. Although countries have generally recovered, China still maintains a huge standing army. Two-thirds of the country's expenditure belongs to military expenses, and millions of haggard people are struggling with death, without any protection. In this dark scene, the only bright spot is that all parties are calling for the need to achieve democracy, peace and prosperity. However, so far there are only empty words and no reality. According to experts, the main steps to solve China's long-standing problems are: (1) unconditional permanent peace; (2) restoration of transportation; (3) stabilization of the currency system; (4) reduction of donations and taxes; (5) subsidizing domestic industry; (6) strict control of housing and prices; (7) well-organized army. China today spends billions of national currency to maintain a large army engaged in civil war, and even the capital does not have sufficient funds to repair houses. The situation is also quite urgent, and there are no first-class inns for temporary accommodation. The only Western-style hotel in Beijing is occupied by American officers and their secretaries, and non-military personnel are not allowed to enter. The annual rent of the new site of the Nanjing Foreign Correspondents Club is 50 million national currency, which is about 20,000 US dollars, which shows the situation. Although prices are stable, they have not fallen. The cost of an ordinary meal is about 3 US dollars or more. A plain sun hat sells for 25 cents in the United States, but here it costs about 4 US dollars. A bottle of wine costs 1 US dollar, an orange costs 31 cents, and a newspaper costs 12 cents. There are very few brand-new or nearly brand-new cars in Nanjing, mostly Jeeps, military vehicles, delivery trucks of unknown age, and rickshaws. The high price of food has led many civil servants to resign. What will happen to China's economy? This is the most popular guess in Beijing now.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海五十个人民团体呼号  要做主人不做奴隶  国民党区弥漫恐惧失望涣散和饥馑\n\n1946-08-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　上海五十个人民团体呼号\n    要做主人不做奴隶\n    国民党区弥漫恐惧失望涣散和饥馑\n    【新华社南京廿八日电】沪讯：包括五十个以上各界人民团体的上海人民团体联合会与全国和平运动大会，顷发表“自由保障宣言”，首称：我们这个名列民主阵营的战胜国，连普通民主国家人民所应有的起码自由也还没有保障，甚至从事民主运动的团体和人士，正在受着无理非法的压迫、凌辱和惨杀。政治协商会议闭幕以来，不断发生反政协、反和平、反民主的暴行和惨案，以事实否定了国民党当局自己所宣布的诺言，破坏了自己所同意的协议，无异在人民面前宣布自己政治信用的破产。每一个没有成见的人都会看得明白：从较场口事件起直到李公朴、闻一多被害止一连串的暴行和惨案，都是国民党当局所授意（明示或暗示），至少也是国民党当局鼓励或纵容的结果，国民党及其政府，决不能逃避其应负的责任。宣言中指出：民主政治的起码内容，就是人民必须有身体、言论、出版、集会、结社的基本自由，得不到这些自由，人民就是奴隶。宣言力称：中国人民继续五十年的革命和八年的抗战，前仆后继，义无反顾的原因，就是要做主人，不要再做奴隶。中国人民既不愿做满清帝国和北洋军阀的奴隶，又不愿意做日本帝国主义的奴隶，自然也不愿做今日反动集团的奴隶。谁要强迫中国人民再做奴隶，中国人民一定要跟谁斗争到底。宣言中最后号召发动全国人民的力量，一致要求政府立即实行以下诸事：（一）停止全面内战，恢复和平；（二）履行四项诺言，切实保障人民自由；（三）执行政协五项决议及整军方案，成立民主的联合政府，召开民主的国民大会，制定民主的宪法；（四）取消一切特务组织；（五）各党派共同组织调查委员会，彻查较场口事件以来一切暴行惨案的真相，严办祸手或凶手，并惩办负责的治安当局；（六）抚恤一切死者，赔偿一切伤者的医药费及其他损失；（七）释放一切政治犯。\n    【新华社延安二十八日电】据联合社报导：日本投降后一年，中国仍为被征服国家之记号，人民惶惑、失望、涣散、经济情形混乱、国库空虚，国家继续遭受战争摧残与分裂，人民在广大的幅员内不能自由往来，大片地方仍遭紧密封锁，洪水、饥馑与恐惧弥漫全境。各国虽然相率复员，而中国仍维持庞大的常备军，国家支出三分之二属于军费，数百万面目憔悴之人民则与死亡挣扎，一无保护。在此黑暗景象中，其唯一光明之点，殆为各方面皆在高呼必须达到民主和平与繁荣。惟迄今只有空言，并无实际。如欲解决中国积弊，据专家意见，其主要步骤为：（一）无条件永久和平；（二）恢复交通；（三）稳定币制；（四）减轻捐税；（五）补助本国工业；（六）房屋、物价严行管制；（七）所编军队。中国今日不惜以数十亿国币，维持大军从事内战，而于首都亦无充分款项修理房屋，情形亦颇紧急，且无头等客寓可供假宿，京中唯一西式旅馆，由美国军官及其秘书占住，不准非军人入内。南京外国记者俱乐部新址，其全年租金为国币五千万元，约合美金二万元，即此可见一斑。物价虽平，但未降落，平常一餐之费，约需美金三元以上，便服太阳帽一顶，在美国售两角五分，此间须合到美金四元左右。一瓶酒需美金一元，一只橘子三角一分，报纸需一角二分，南京全新汽车或近乎全新之汽车甚少，大多数为吉普车，兵器车，不知年龄之运货车与人力车。食物价昂，致公务员多愿去职。中国经济将于何为底里尽露，此为现在京中最风行之猜测。"

To achieve this task, the following work is specifically stipulated: 1. All units should hold various meetings based on their specific circumstances to unify thinking. All comrades, especially leading cadres at all levels, must clearly establish the following concept: heroic combat and helping the people to emancipate themselves are the basic tasks and duties of the people's army. 2. In coordination with the military training plan, organize study, examine thinking, and liquidate confused ideas. Systematically collect concrete and vivid materials from the mass movement, compile them into teaching materials, and educate the troops. Mobilize poor peasant soldiers and cadres who have recently joined the army after experiencing the mass movement to act as instructors, reporting on their own past suffering and emancipation process to educate everyone. 3. In addition to retaining necessary cadres to maintain daily work, all sub-district organs and troops must resolutely dispatch one-half to two-thirds of their cadres to work in the countryside. All field troops must also dispatch cadres to the countryside. 4. Create model movements to help peasants emancipate themselves. 5. Strengthen leadership and correct the view of underestimating mass movement work.

    "content": "[Changzhi News] After the implementation of \"Land to the Tiller\" in Nanbei Great Cooperative, Wu'an Third District, each person had an average of six mu of land. Because of the small labor force, they could not cultivate all of it, so they donated 200 mu to the peasant brothers in the neighboring Wuhe Township.\n\nWuhe Township has barren land, with an average of just over two mu of land per person, and often has to sell labor in other villages to make a living. The two big landlords in Nanbei Great Cooperative occupied more than 50 qing of land, and were the main villages where Wuhe Township sold its labor. Now these lands have been taken back by the peasants, but due to the lack of labor, they cannot be fully cultivated. The village leadership proposed: \"Now that we have turned the tables, we must also help the neighboring villages to turn the tables.\" After discussion and deliberation by the masses, it was decided to donate 200 mu of land to the poor brothers in Wuhe Township. The villagers of Wuhe Township were extremely excited when they heard the news, and immediately sent a reply to express their gratitude, saying: Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao could such a thing be possible. They also said: Although we are poor, we do not lack labor. In the future, we will actively help you with some things, just as you help us. (Shi Hong)\n\n[Changzhi News] Many landlords in Wu'an Third District, after the mass movement, have realized the boredom and shame of parasitic exploitation and have generally become involved in productive labor. When the peasants were carrying out the \"Land to the Tiller\" grievances and settling accounts, they gave the landlords' lives the necessary care. The landlords, feeling grateful, expressed one after another that they would rebuild their families in future production just like the peasants. They said: The family started with one's own labor is the most solid and promising. Landlords from the same association said when requesting to join mutual aid groups, I don't know how to farm, let the villagers teach me! Landlord Yang Peilong, when the work in the fields was slack, would pick up a vegetable basket and sell it everywhere. He said: As long as you participate in production properly, there is no problem with life. Yang Tixian, who is over fifty years old, used to have two wives and employed several long-term workers. Now he and his wife and children are working very hard. He smiled and said to the reporter: I can carry, pick, and plant now, look how good! As women in the new district are generally participating in production, the daughters-in-law and daughters of landlord families are also freely jumping out of the door and heading to the fields. Cheng Shuxian and Zhai Lucong from Boyan are both young women in their twenties, and now they can carry water and manure, and also harvest and hoe seedlings. The villagers unanimously praised them as good women, and the radio station also called on women to learn from them.\n                                                  (Shi Hong)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南北大社农民帮助邻村翻身  赠田二百余亩给五和乡  武安地主纷纷参加劳动\n史洪\n1946-08-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　南北大社农民帮助邻村翻身\n    赠田二百余亩给五和乡\n    武安地主纷纷参加劳动\n    【长治讯】武安三区南北大社在推行“耕者有其田”后，每人平均有六亩土地，因劳力较少，不能全部耕种，乃以二百亩赠给邻村五和乡的农民弟兄。\n    五和乡地瘠土薄，每人平均土地不过二亩多，经常到外村卖工度日。南北大社两家大地主就占有土地五十多顷，为五和乡卖工主要村庄。现在这些土地已由农民收回，但因劳力缺乏，不能全部耕种，该村领导上即提出“咱们翻了身，还须帮助邻村翻身。”经群众酝酿讨论后，乃决定以二百亩地赠给五和乡的贫苦弟兄们，五和乡村民闻讯，感奋异常，当即复函申谢，并说：只有在共产党毛主席领导下，这样的事情才会成为可能。又称：我们虽穷，但劳力不缺，以后我们将主动的帮助你们作一些事情，如同你们帮助我们一样。（史洪）\n    【长治讯】武安三区许多地主，经过群众运动，认识了寄生剥削生活的无聊与可耻，已普遍的卷入生产劳动中，农民们进行“耕者有其田”的诉苦清算时，对于地主的生活都给以必要的照顾，地主们感激之余，纷纷表示，要在今后的生产中和农民一样把自己的家再发起来。他们说：用自己劳动发起的家是最巩固的，是最有前途的。同会地主在请求参加互助组时说，我不会种地，乡亲们让我学学吧！地主杨培龙，在地里活闲时，就挑起菜担四外出卖，他说：只要好好参加生产，生活是没有问题的。五十多岁的杨体现，过去有两个老婆用着几个长工，现在他和他老婆孩子劳动的很起劲，他笑着对记者说：我现在会担会挑会种，您看有多好！由于新区妇女普遍的参加生产，地主家的媳妇闺女也自由的跳出门限走向田园。伯延程书贤、翟路从，都是二十多岁的青年妇女，现在能担水担粪，还能收割锄苗，村里人一致称赞她们是好妇女，广播台上也号召妇女们向她们学习。\n                                                  （史洪）"

    "content": "[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] To assist poor farmers in achieving liberation and to quickly realize the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's (CPPCC) resolution of \"Land to the Tiller,\" Party cadres in various border regions have been persuading their families to donate land for poor farmers to cultivate, amounting to over two thousand mu so far. Comrade Wang Tangwen, Secretary of the Yicheng County Committee of the Taiyue Region, whose family was a well-known landlord in Yuanqu, wrote to his father at the beginning of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction campaign, stating: \"As a revolutionary cadre, my family should become a model in implementing government decrees and realizing our Party's advocacy of 'Land to the Tiller.' I hope that we can proactively implement thorough rent reduction and interest rate reduction for tenant farmers.\" He also proposed to the Yuanqu Farmers' Association that \"rent reduction in the Third District can start with my family.\" At Comrade Wang's request, over two hundred Farmers' Association cadres, village cadres, and tenant farmers conducted a detailed five-day accounting at his home. Wang returned eight manor estates totaling over 500 mu of land, 30 cave dwellings, 20 oxen, over 50 shi of grain, and 300 yuan in cash to over 30 tenant families, including Wang Zikang and Fan Maobai, and wrote and delivered the documents on the spot. The farmers also, recognizing Comrade Wang Tangwen's dedication to the revolution and his contributions to the people, specially retained 38 mu of land and six houses to take care of his family's livelihood. Comrade Wen Zhongliu, Director of the Yuanqu Economic Bureau, also persuaded his father, Mr. Wen Boxue, to donate three manor estates totaling over 200 mu, two oxen, three thatched sheds, and twelve cave dwellings to several farmers, including Che Dashun, leaving only eight mu to maintain their livelihood. Mr. Wen Boxue also politely declined the farmers' offers of more assistance.\n　　Comrade Gao Muhong, a member of the Border Region Cultural Circle and Director of the Taihang Literary Federation, donated over 50 mu of land in mid-August. Comrade Gao personally returned to his hometown (Wu乡 - Wu Xiang) to handle the formalities, inviting farmers like Mi Haiqing to the county government to draw up a land donation agreement, and repeatedly instructed the farmers to engage in production and build their families. Comrade Liu Longju of the Third Sub-district Command of the Jinnan Military Region has once again donated 70 mu of land to the people of his village. Including the 70 mu returned to tenant farmers when Handan was liberated last year, Comrade Liu has donated 140 mu of land, leaving 60 mu for his family to maintain their livelihood. Comrade Liu said to the masses at the meeting: \"The landlord class has occupied land and exploited farmers for thousands of years. This exploitation should have been abolished long ago, and the land should be returned to the farmers who cultivate it.\" Comrade Mu Jianhua of the Wuan Sub-committee also recently sent a letter to the Wuan County Committee, forwarding the Zanhuang County Committee's decision to donate all of his personal 17 mu of land to poor farmers and wrote a letter to persuade his father to donate land. The Zanhuang County Committee replied to Comrade Mu, stating: \"Your donation of your only 17 mu of land demonstrates your commitment to the Party's land policy and the class character of a Communist Party member who loves the farmers.\" Following Comrade Mu, Mr. Wang Yu, a teacher at the Xituyu Elementary School, also donated 100 mu of irrigated and dry land, 120 rooms, three mules, and furniture to the farmers. In addition, Comrade Hao Guozhen, a correspondent for the Taihang Xinhua Daily in Heshun, also recently donated his 20 mu of land to the farmers. Comrades Shen Yulin, Gao Fengzhen, and Wang Jingpu from Zuoquan have also donated land and houses to the farmers.\n　　The exemplary actions of the above Party members and cadres have been praised by all sectors of society. The farmers who have acquired land also deeply feel the sincere love of the Communist Party members and cadres for the masses and have all expressed that they will respond to Chairman Mao's call to engage in production and build a prosperous liberated area.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Huai'an, 28th - After the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region Government implemented the CPPCC's resolution of \"Land to the Tiller,\" many farmers who had been exiled to Beijing and Shanghai to pull rickshaws and work as peddlers under the rule of the enemy, puppets, and feudal lords have returned. In the three villages of the Eqian Township in Shitou District, Huai'an alone, more than 20 people have returned to engage in production on the land they have obtained. Xu Xiangcheng from Zhengang Village, because he could not pay the public grass tax, had his house demolished by the puppet army and was forced to pull a rickshaw in Nanjing. His wife and children fled to relatives for shelter. After the establishment of the democratic government, his wife returned home, and the government helped rebuild the house and distributed land to him. He joyfully returned to his hometown after receiving a letter from his wife. Chen Ziyin from Zhao Village used to gamble, drink, and indulge in prostitution. Once, he lost money and even sold his wife. Someone advised him to work in the fields, but he said, \"What's the point of working in the fields? The grain grown still belongs to the officials.\" Then his family drove him out, and he had to take one of his children to Nanjing to pull a rickshaw. As a result, he couldn't earn money pulling a rickshaw after a year, and his child died. Now he has also returned and is working hard in production. Xu Kaisan from E Shang Village, his family of eight cultivated five mu of land belonging to the landlord. After paying rent and taxes, there was no grain left. He got angry and joined the 117th Division of the Chiang army. Once, a battalion commander was robbed by bandits near his home and accused him of being the mastermind, and he was severely beaten. So he fled to Nanjing to pull a rickshaw at night. Not long ago, he returned from Nanjing and received five mu of land and three mu of paddy fields. Every day he also catches fish in the river and pickles them with salt. Now he enjoys the cool air and plays the huqin every night, and his family no longer worries about hunger. He requested to join the army to defend his hometown, but the government advised him to concentrate on production and do a good job in the rear service because his eyesight was poor at night.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各地党员干部首起模范  纷纷献田给贫苦农民  我党政策下人人有地种  苏皖流亡农民归来生产\n\n1946-08-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各地党员干部首起模范\n    纷纷献田给贫苦农民\n    我党政策下人人有地种\n    苏皖流亡农民归来生产\n    【本报特讯】为帮助贫苦农民翻身，迅速实现政协“耕者有其田”决议，边区各地党员干部纷纷说服自己家庭，献田给贫苦农民耕种，前后已达两千余亩。太岳翼城县委书记王唐文同志，家庭为垣曲著明地主，减租减息开始时，王即致书其父称：“我身为革命干部，我家应成为执行政府法令的模范，实现我党“耕者有其田”主张，望能主动向佃户进行彻底减租减息”，并向垣曲农会提出“三区减租可先从我家开始”。在王同志要求下，农会干部村干部佃户二百余人到他家进行了五天的详细清算，王将庄田八处共土地五百余亩，窑房三十座，耕牛二十头，粮食五十余石，现洋三百元，退还佃户王自康、樊茂白等三十余家，并当场书写文书，交付农民。农民亦以王唐文同志献身革命，有功人民，特留土地三十八亩，房子六座照顾其家庭生活。垣曲经济局长文中流同志，亦说服其父文博学先生将三处庄田二百余亩、耕牛两头、草棚三座、窑十二孔，献给农民车大顺等数家，只留下八亩维持生活，文博学先生并婉言谢绝了农民更多的照顾。\n    边区文化界参议员太行文联主任高沐鸿同志于八月中旬献出土地五十余亩。高同志亲自返里（武乡）办理手续，将农民米海清等请至县府缮写献田文约，并再三嘱咐农民好好生产发家。冀南三分区司令部刘龙驹同志，又一次将土地七十亩献给本村人民，连同去年邯郸刚解放时退还佃户之七十亩，刘同志已献田百四十亩，家中留下六十亩维持生活。刘同志在大会上对群众说：“地主阶级占有土地剥削农民已经几千年了，早就应该把这种剥削取消，将土地归还耕种的农民了”。武安分委穆建华同志亦于日前致函武安县委转达赞皇县委，将其个人所有之全部土地十七亩献给贫苦农民，并写信劝其父献田。赞皇县委复函穆同志称：“你将仅有的十七亩土地献出，表现了你执行党的土地政策及热爱农民的共产党员阶级品质。”继穆同志之后，以西土域小学教员王瑜先生亦将其水旱地百亩，房百二十间，骡子三头及家具等件献给农民。此外，和顺太行新华日报通讯员郝国珍同志亦已于日前将自己土地二十亩献给农民。左权干部申玉林、高凤振、王镜普等同志亦纷纷献田产房屋给农民。\n    以上党员、干部之模范行动，深得各界赞扬；获得土地之农民亦深感共产党员、干部对群众真诚热爱，均表示将响应毛主席号召好好生产，建设繁荣的解放区。\n    【新华社淮安二十八日电】苏皖边区政府，实行政协“耕者有其田”的决议后，过去在敌伪和封建统治下流亡京沪拉黄包车做小贩的农民，仅淮安石塘区鹅钱乡三个庄就回来了二十多人，在已得的土地上从事生产。该乡阵岗庄徐香成，因缴不出公草被伪军拆了房子逼到南京拉车，老婆孩子逃到亲戚家避难。民主政府成立后，老婆回了家，政府帮助把房盖好又分得了地，他接到老婆的信欣喜的回到了家乡。赵庄陈子银，以前吃喝嫖赌，有一次输了钱把老婆也卖了。有人劝他下田，他说：“下田干什么呢？长的粮食还不是老官的。”接着家里人把他赶出去，他只好带着一个孩子跑到南京拉车。结果混了一年，拉车挣不了钱，孩子又死了，现在也回到家努力生产。鹅尚庄徐凯三，全家八口种了地主五亩田，除了缴租和捐税之外就剩不下粮食了。一生气就去蒋军一一七师当兵，一次有个营长走到他家附近被土匪抢劫，诬他是主谋，将他毒打一顿，于是他就在夜里逃跑到南京拉车。不久以前，从南京回来分得五亩田和三亩秧田，每天又到河里捉鱼用盐腌起，现在他每天晚上乘乘凉拉拉胡琴，一家老小也不愁饥饿。他要求参加军队保卫家乡，政府因他眼睛夜盲，劝他好好生产把后方勤务做好。"

    "content": "Taiyue Daily Publishes Editorial\nSaluting the Military and Civilians on the Tongpu Front\n[This newspaper, Yangcheng, 27th dispatch] Today, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily published an editorial titled \"Saluting the Military and Civilians on the Tongpu Front.\" The editorial began by stating: Following the preliminary victory in southern Shanxi, our army in the central section of Tongpu launched a counterattack in mid-month, liberating Hongdong in the first battle, recovering Zhaocheng in the second, and recapturing Huoxian in the third. We now control over 170 miles of the central Tongpu line. Although the Chiang army had American planes for cover and was equipped with American weapons, once surrounded, they laid down their arms one after another. In the past month or so, the Chiang-Yan puppet troops annihilated and forced to lay down their weapons on the Tongpu front amounted to 11,000. The good news has boosted morale tremendously. It continued: The victory on the Tongpu front has significant meaning. Chiang Kai-shek successively transferred eight divisions of his army across the Yellow River, attempting to echo Yan Xishan from the north and south, to break through the Tongpu Road in one fell swoop, using it as a \"blood transfusion line\" for the civil war, and as a foundation for further large-scale invasions of the Liberated Areas to expand the civil war in Shanxi. After our repeated counterattacks, their fierce flames were initially thwarted. Now, more than two months later, not only has the railway south of Linfen failed to be opened, but the railway north of Linfen has been controlled by us for more than 170 miles, cutting off Chiang Kai-shek's \"civil war blood transfusion line\" and severing the direct connection between Chiang and Yan. Now, on the southern front, the areas temporarily occupied by the Chiang army are ablaze with guerrilla warfare everywhere. The Chiang army's situation is no different from the predicament of the Japanese who were trapped in bunkers in those years. On the northern front, our army is approaching the county of Lingshi, nearing the military stronghold of \"Hanshin Ridge,\" dealing a head-on blow to Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to expand the civil war in Shanxi! The editorial pointed out that the Chiang army's expedition was unjustifiable, and the soldiers were weary of war and low in morale. Our troops, on the other hand, fight with grief and anger, and patriotic sentiment is at an all-time high, greatly improving combat effectiveness. In the Battle of Zhucun, Xia County, a single squad annihilated 170 Chiang soldiers in ten minutes. In addition, Chiang's army is rampant with secret agents everywhere, engaging in arson, murder, rape, and all kinds of evil deeds, including cutting open pregnant women and ripping out infants, which is utterly inhumane! Wherever their beastly hooves reach, the people flee, rising up in resistance. Now, the Chiang army in southern Shanxi is holding on to strongholds in units of regiments, and thirty to fifty people dare not come out at all. Our army, however, receives abundant support, and everyone supports the front. During the Hongzhao battle, 120,000 people were fully mobilized, launching a participation competition, with 70,000 women rushing to the front to carry stretchers, transport supplies, and care for the wounded, truly forming a patriotic national mobilization. In contrast, the Chiang army is deep in enemy territory, with difficulty in supply. Relying solely on robbery is a drop in the bucket and does not help the situation. Chiang's soldiers complain to each other about not having enough to eat, and anti-war and war-weary sentiments are overflowing in the army. This is a major crisis facing the Chiang army in southern Shanxi!\n    The editorial concluded by pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek is continuing to increase troops crossing north, and the situation in southern Shanxi is still very tense. We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of \"guarding against arrogance and rashness,\" respond to the recent call of the Central Bureau, be neither arrogant nor slack, make persistent efforts, carry forward the glorious example of the Tongpu campaign, strive for greater victories, defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and fight for the independence, peace, and democracy of the whole country!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳日报发表社论  向同蒲前线军民致敬\n\n1946-08-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳日报发表社论\n    向同蒲前线军民致敬\n    【本报阳城廿七日电】今日太岳新华日报以“向同蒲前线军民致敬”为题，发表社论，该社论首称：继晋南初步胜利之后，同蒲中段我军，于本月中旬，展开反击，一战解放洪洞，再战恢复赵城，三战光复霍县。控制同蒲中段一百七十余里。蒋军虽有美机掩护，美械装备，但一经包围，则纷纷放下武器，月余来，同蒲前线蒋阎伪军被歼灭及被迫放下武器者，达一万一千之众，捷报传来，万众振奋。继称：同蒲前线的胜利，具有重大的意义，蒋介石先后抽调八师大军北渡黄河，企图与阎锡山南北呼应，一鼓打通同蒲路，将它作为内战的“输血管”，作为向解放区进一步大举进犯的依托，来扩大山西内战；经我一再反击，凶焰始挫，迄今时逾两月，不仅临汾以南铁路迟迟未能打通，而临汾以北的铁路，又被我控制一百七十余里，斩断了蒋介石的“内战输血管”，切断蒋阎南北的直接连系。现在南线方面，蒋军暂时侵占的地区，到处燃起游击烽火，蒋军的处境，与当年日本人困守碉堡的窘况，并无两样。在北线，我军兵临灵石的县，逼近军事要冲“韩信岭”予蒋介石扩大山西内战的阴谋，当头一棒！该社论指出蒋军师出无名，士兵压战，士气低落；我们哀兵善战，爱国情绪空前高涨，战斗力大大提高，夏县朱村战斗中，十分钟内，一个班即消灭一百七十个蒋军。加以蒋军到处特务横行，烧杀奸淫，无所不为，剖胎割乳，惨绝人寰！兽蹄所至，人民逃避一空，群起反抗，现晋南蒋军，均以一团为单位，困守据点，三五十人根本不敢出来；而我军得道多助，人人支援前线，洪赵战役中，十二万人民，全体总动员，展开参战竞赛，七万妇女奔赴前线，抬担架、运输、照护伤兵、真正形成爱国主义的全民动员。反观蒋军孤军深入，接济困难，光靠抢劫，杯水车薪，无济于事，蒋军士兵相互埋怨吃不饱饭，反战厌战之情溢于军中，这是面临晋南蒋军的重大危机！\n    社论最后指出蒋介石正在继续增兵北渡，晋南形势仍十分紧张，我们应紧紧记住毛主席“戒骄戒燥”的教训，响应中央局最近的号召，不傲不懈，再接再厉，发扬同蒲作战的光荣范例，争取更大的胜利，打垮蒋介石的进攻，为全国的独立、和平、民主而奋斗！"

    "content": "[Report from our Jinnan correspondent] In more than thirty villages west of Dezhou, an anti-traitor liquidation movement has been launched. In the struggle against concealing land and shifting burdens, the broad masses of middle peasants have also been drawn into the movement. The peasants have legally recovered blood-and-sweat debts, reducing rent and recovering grain payments totaling 24.45 million yuan, equivalent to more than 2,000 mu of land. In the new district of Gucheng, District One, near Dezhou, the large landowners Xie and Ma, and landowners from outside the district, occupied more than 80 hectares of land. Their tenants, who were subjected to high rents and exploitation, were scattered across more than 70 villages in the district. After the incident (likely referring to the Second Sino-Japanese War), in order to evade enemy and puppet extortion, the landlords mortgaged most of their land, causing many tenants to lose their land and their lives to become even more impoverished. After the liberation of Dezhou, the turn-over movement was launched in more than 30 villages including Dongbalizhuang and Longfengdian. The turning-over horn for the peasants first sounded in Dongbalizhuang and Xiaotun. Tenant farmers and poor peasants accounted for one-half of the village, most of whom rented land from the Ma family. During the rent reduction struggle, the middle peasants also joined together to settle accounts with the landlords for illegal spending. In their grievances, the tenants said that when paying rent, they not only had to address the landlords with respectful titles, but if they were late, even a moment late, one dou of rent would be increased by one sheng, and if they were three days late, the land would be taken back. In times of famine, even if no grain was seen, the tenants still had to sell their belongings and land to pay the rent, leaving many farmers separated from their wives and children. As a result of the liquidation, the peasants recovered 530 mu of land. The peasants in Xiaotun recovered 123 mu of land, and 130 poor peasant tenant households received land. Secondly, the masses in Longfengdian had a very high desire to turn over, but the leadership was controlled by bad elements. The chairman of the farmers' association, the captain of the self-defense force, and the \"cowherd\" (the landlord's steward) jointly suppressed the peasants and obstructed and sabotaged the turning-over movement. After understanding the situation, the turning-over team detained the \"cowherd\" Wang Yutian. The peasants said to him, \"You have been a 'cowherd' all your life, and you are still a pauper! We poor people are all one family!\" These words moved Wang Yutian, and he confessed their sabotage conspiracy and offered the landlord's documents to help the tenants settle accounts. As a result, the peasants recovered unpaid rent, returned concealed land and paid burdens in silver dollars equivalent to 281 mu of land. Fifty-six households of also impoverished, widowed, orphaned and tenant families were distributed land, with an average of 3.2 mu per person. The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers had 5 mu per person, and the middle peasants also received some.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 德州新区普遍清算  大部农民获得土地  龙凤店赤贫孤寡每人得地三亩二分\n\n1946-08-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　德州新区普遍清算\n    大部农民获得土地\n    龙凤店赤贫孤寡每人得地三亩二分\n    【本报冀南讯】德州以西三十余村展开反奸清算运动。在反黑瞒地和转嫁负担斗争中广大中农也全部卷入运动，农民们依法收回血汗账，共减租倒粮款二千四百四十五万元，折合土地二千余亩。靠近德州的新区故城一区，大地主谢家马家和外区地主即占有土地八十多顷，被他们高租剥削的佃户，遍布全区七十多个村，事变后地主为逃避敌伪勒索，将大部土地典当出，以致许多佃户失掉土地，生活更加无着。德州解放后，东八里庄、龙凤店等三十余村，即普遍展开翻身运动。农民的翻身号炮首先在东八里庄，小屯打响了，该村佃户贫农即占二分之一，大部租种马家土地。减租斗争时，中农也联合向地主清算非法花消，诉苦中佃户们说到交租时不只爷爷奶奶的称呼人家，并且送晚了一时一斗租即加一升，迟了三天就将地收回。灾荒时没见粮食，佃户也要卖东西卖土地来交租，许多农民被弄得妻离子散。清算结果，农民收回土地五百三十亩。小屯农民收回土地十二顷三十亩，一百三十家贫农佃户得到了土地。其次龙凤店群众要求翻身情绪很高，但领导权被坏分子掌握了，农会主任、自卫队长、牛头（地主的管家）联合压制农民，阻碍与破坏翻身运动。翻身队了解情况后，把牛头王玉田扣了，农民们向他说：“你当了一辈子牛头，还是个穷光蛋呀！咱们穷人才是一家人！”这话感动了王玉田，他坦白出他们的破坏阴谋，并献出了地主的文书来帮助佃户清算。结果农民收回倒租，退黑瞒地负担洋折合土地二百八十一亩。五十六户亦贫、孤寡、佃户分得土地，每人平均已有三亩二分，抗属三户每人已有五亩，中农也分得一部。"

Only in this way can we effectively win the victory of the self-defense war. Then many comrades spoke enthusiastically, expressing their willingness to support the front line with practical actions. Some said: \"Shorten working hours so that our newspaper can be published earlier.\" Some said: \"Let's print more 'paper bombs' and send them to the front to repel Chiang Kai-shek's attack.\" Some said: \"We must save materials, and not waste a bit of lead, iron, coal, or paper, and launch a campaign to save every piece of paper.\" Everyone spoke enthusiastically, showing their infinite concern for the Patriotic Self-Defense War, and then they voluntarily donated some of the money they had saved to express their feelings.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 24th (delayed dispatch): Chiang Kai-shek's long-planned military action to attack the Rehe Liberated Area has now fully begun, and battles are taking place in central and eastern Rehe. In central Rehe, one division of the 13th Army, which was increased from Yeboshou to Tianyi and Dujia Wopu (north of Yeboshou), began crossing the Laodian River on the 21st, via Malichengzi, occupying Taohuashan, Bajiazi, Liangkushu, Majiazi, and other places (all northwest of Tianyi). On the 22nd, they continued westward, invading Ningcheng County, and advancing southwest to the vicinity of Balizhong (north of Pingquan), attempting to cooperate with Chiang's troops advancing westward from Pingquan towards Chengde, with the aim of attacking Longhua. In coordination with this offensive by Chiang's troops, bandits organized by Chiang's troops in Weichang, Chifeng, and other places, known as the \"Nanyang\" forces, are constantly stirring up trouble. These bandits are fleeing from the Chaoyang direction. On the 24th, Chiang's planes also flew to Chengde, Weichang, Chifeng, and other places for strafing and reconnaissance. In eastern Rehe, the 18th Division of the 93rd Army of Chiang's troops, which is assembled in Jinxi, Suizhong, Xingcheng, and other places, has begun to invade the eastern Rehe Liberated Area in multiple directions, and has now invaded Yaowangmiao and Linglongta in eastern Jianchang. Currently, 3,000 Chiang's troops and more than 30 carts are assembled in Yaowangmiao, preparing to continue their westward invasion, joining the Chiang's troops in Xingpingquan to attack Chengde. Fierce battles are currently underway on all fronts.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Zunhua, 27th: The Chiang's troops surrounding the eastern Hebei Liberated Area are taking advantage of the Xianghe Incident to actively launch a large-scale offensive. Their adjusted deployment is now complete, and they are beginning to stir along the Great Wall. A portion of Huo Shouyi's 12th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which has been successively arriving in Qinhuangdao from Shandong, and the 346th Regiment of the 116th Division of the 53rd Army have invaded north, occupying the Yiyuankou pass of the Great Wall in the Linyu Liberated Area. On the 24th, they continued to attack Shanshenmiao and Caozhuang (both under Linyu), and also dispatched more than 100 political bandits led by Li Dingjiao, who were transferred from outside the customs and equipped with light weapons, to operate in the Leting Liberated Area. A portion of the 62nd Army stationed in Tangshan (this army arrived from Taiwan last month) advanced along the Tangshan-Fengrun Highway to Longwangmiao on the 22nd, and continued to Baigezhuang (northeast of Fengrun) on the 24th. They are now forcibly driving local people to build roads on a large scale. The 30th Regiment of the 5th Division of the 94th Army of Chiang's troops in Fengrun has been busy preparing for war for days. The Chiang's troops in this area seem to have the intention of advancing west along the Fengrun-Yutian Highway to attack Yutian. Military transport along the Pinggu line is also extremely frequent. On the 21st, it increased to two divisions in Huairou, one regiment in Miyun, and two battalions of the Yamashita unit of the Japanese army in Shunyi, which has further intensified the situation in the Gubeikou area. On the 18th, a train of Chiang's troops also arrived in Tongxian from Ping, including a unit of American troops. A large-scale war in the Xianghe and Sanhe areas seems likely to break out again within days.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Harbin, 27th: Chiang Kai-shek has launched a new offensive in the Northeast, causing the Northeast war, which had been slightly eased, to become tense again. More than 2,000 troops of the 87th Division of Chiang's army stationed in Liaoyuan (Zhengjiatun), in coordination with the 6th Division stationed in France, attacked Kangping in two routes, north and south, and invaded the county seat at 8:00 am on the 25th. Kangping County is located on the northern border of Liaoning Province. Liaoyuan to its north, Faku to its south, and Zhangwu to its southwest have all been invaded by Chiang's troops. This invasion of Heping by Chiang's troops clearly aims to expand its occupied area, consolidate and strengthen its occupation and rule, in preparation for launching a further large-scale offensive. Recently, the Central News Agency has been heavily publicizing the Democratic Allied Army's siege of Tieling, with the aim of covering up its own invasion of Kangping.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 热河冀东东北形势紧张  蒋军开始向我进犯\n\n1946-08-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　热河冀东东北形势紧张\n    蒋军开始向我进犯\n    【新华社承德二十四日电】（迟到）蒋介石布置已久的进攻热河解放区的军事行动，业已全面开始，战事正在热中、热东进行中。热中方面，本月二十日十三军一个师，由叶柏寿增至天义及杜家窝铺（叶柏寿北）后，于二十一日开始渡过老店河，经马力城子，占领桃花山、八家子、两棵树、马家子等地（均在天义西北）。二十二日继续西进，侵陷宁城县城，并向西南进攻，进至八里钟（平泉北）一带，有与由平泉向西进犯承德之蒋军相配合，以进攻隆化之势。配合蒋军这一进攻，围场、赤峰等地由蒋军组织的土匪所谓“南洋”部队，不时蠢动。该匪系由朝阳方向窜去者。二十四日，蒋机并出动到承德围场、赤峰等地扫射侦察。热东方面，集结于锦西、绥中、兴城等地蒋军九十三军十八师，已开始分路向热东解放区进犯，现已侵至建昌东药王庙、玲珑塔等地。药王庙现集结蒋军三千余，大车三十余辆，准备继续向西进犯，兴平泉蒋军合犯承德。现各线均激战中。\n    【新华社遵化二十七日电】冀东解放区周围蒋军，利用香河事件，积极发动大规模进攻，现调整布署，业已完毕，正在长城沿线开始蠢动。由山东陆续开抵秦皇岛之蒋介石十二军霍守义部一部，及五十三军一一六师三四六团等已北犯，侵占临榆解放区长城隘口义院口。二十四日续犯山神庙、操状（均临榆属）、并由关外征调装备有轻型武器的政治土匪李丁角部百余人派至乐亭解放区活动。驻唐山之六十二军（该军于上月由台湾开来）一部，于二十二日沿唐（山）丰（润）公路进抵龙王庙，二十四日续抵白各庄（丰润东北），现正强驱沿线民众，大事修路。丰润蒋军九十四军五师三十团，连日备战忙碌，该线蒋军似有沿丰润玉田公路西犯玉田模样。平古线蒋军军运亦极频繁，廿一日即增至怀柔两个师，密云一个团，顺义日军山下部队两个大队，古北口方面形势，已因之益趋紧张。通县亦于十八日由平开到蒋军一列车，其中并有美军一部。香河、三河地区大规模战事，日内似将再起。\n    【新华社哈尔滨二十七日电】蒋介石在东北已发动新的进攻，致使一度稍息的东北战事复趋紧张。驻辽源（郑家屯）之蒋军八十七师二千余人，配合其驻法国之第六师，以北两路向我康平进攻，并于二十五日上午八时将该县城侵占。按康平县位于辽宁省北部边境，其北面之辽源，南面之法库，西南之彰武，已先后为蒋军侵占。蒋军此次侵入和平，显图扩大其占领范围，巩固与加强其占领与统治，以为进一步发动大规模进攻之准备。近日中央社大事宣传民主联军围攻铁岭，目的即在为其自身之侵陷康平掩护。"

    "content": "Cherish Our Comradeship-in-Arms\n　　——A Recollection of the Dongjiang Column Coordinating with Allied Forces in Combat\nEditor's Note: This article is written by a member of the Dongjiang Column, recalling how they risked their lives to rescue American pilots and assisted American intelligence work while persisting in the anti-Japanese war in Guangdong. At a time when American imperialist elements are helping Chiang Kai-shek expand the civil war, he loudly appeals to people from all walks of life in America: \"Cherish our comradeship-in-arms.\" The original text is as follows:\n　　On February 10th of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), when Lieutenant Kerr of the U.S. 14th Air Force attacked Hong Kong Airport, his plane was set on fire by enemy bullets. Kerr bailed out and escaped, but was closely pursued by Japanese soldiers. However, he was rescued by a young orderly of the Dongjiang Column and, under the strict protection of the local people, survived three weeks of enemy searches before being transferred to the rear. On May 26th, near Daya Bay, they rescued Lieutenant Lovejoy and five other pilots. On January 16th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), they also rescued Lieutenant Iger of the 14th Air Force and Ensign Kerr Han of the U.S. Third Fleet, all of whom were safely returned to the rear. In October of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), the U.S. Military Headquarters in China dispatched Mr. Qu Daiyi, a technical representative of the U.S. Land Technical Resources Committee, with a radio and a radio operator to establish an intelligence group at the Dongjiang Column Headquarters. This group did not leave until September of last year. To assist the U.S. intelligence group, the Dongjiang Column established a special intelligence work department, staffed by more than 200 people. The intelligence station stretched from Hong Kong in the south to Guangzhou in the north, from Hailufeng in the east to the east bank of the Pearl River in the west. After the fall of northern Guangdong and the West River area, it expanded to the West River and North River areas, and the Dongjiang Column specially dispatched carefully selected cadres to develop the work. All expenses were raised independently, and many outstanding cadres sacrificed heroically for this common cause of the Allies. In March of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), U.S. Navy Major Ganshaw led a working group to the Dongjiang liberated area to conduct coastal surveys in preparation for the Allied forces to land there. The Dongjiang Column immediately sent cadres to assist in the on-the-spot investigation and collect relevant materials. Due to the efficient efforts of the Dongjiang Column staff and the direct supply of much valuable intelligence to the U.S. military and the 14th Air Force, the U.S. Military Headquarters in Washington and the 14th Air Force repeatedly praised the Dongjiang Column intelligence station as \"the most important intelligence station for the U.S. military in central Southeast China.\" They praised the intelligence it obtained as being \"consistently superior in quality and quantity,\" making \"a decisive contribution to the success of the U.S. Strategic Service in China,\" and helping the U.S. military command organs \"reach better conclusions and plans.\" In no time, American warmongers have abandoned the friendship between the Chinese and American people, and driven the armed forces composed of the American people to flagrantly help Chiang Kai-shek slaughter the Chinese people in the North China Liberated Areas and undermine the friendship between the Chinese and American people. The American people should unite to urge the U.S. government to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China and stop all aid to Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government in the civil war.

The total value of these materials reaches hundreds of millions of US dollars (far exceeding the total value of US aid to Chiang's lend-lease materials since Japan's surrender, estimated to be sufficient for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war for two years), which will be supplied to Chiang Kai-shek at a low price of 50 million US dollars, in order to prevent the full-scale civil war that Chiang is currently waging with American support from ending one day due to insufficient ammunition; on that day, the \"Chinese peace\" verbally requested by the US government will truly be realized. The only issue not yet resolved in this negotiation is transportation. Chiang Kai-shek is prepared to cede China's airspace rights in exchange for the shipment of these materials from the United States to China. The success of this negotiation will further demonstrate the hypocrisy, imperialism, and cruelty of the US government's policy toward China. The Washington authorities, who are full of talk of peace, seem to feel a strange pleasure in seeing their allied people bombarded to death by American artillery fire, just like the nobles of the late Roman Empire enjoying Roman slaves being devoured by beasts in the arena. Therefore, they are determined to \"assist\" dear China so that the Chinese nation will perish in a long-term barbaric performance that entertains their \"one person\" in the White House. The Communist Party of China calls on all the Chinese people, all the American people, and all the people of the United Nations to rise up together to oppose and stop this sinful transaction, to oppose and correct the US authorities' sinister policy of insisting on creating civil war in China, and to oppose and not recognize the Chiang Kai-shek government's treasonous act of selling out sovereignty in exchange for foreign weapons to slaughter compatriots. The Communist Party of China believes that any secret agreements and protocols between the US and Chiang in this and similar negotiations are illegal, and the Chinese people will not bear any responsibility for this.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 28th: The Shanghai Office of the Communist Party of China held a reception for the press at 10 Massenet Road, Shanghai, at 3:00 PM on the 27th. More than 50 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. According to a report by the Associated Press, \"The CCP reiterated at the meeting its condemnation of the United States' secret sale of surplus military supplies to the Kuomintang government and demanded that the United States cease the current secret negotiations.\" Spokesman Chen Jiakang said, \"If Marshall's mission is to succeed, the United States must stop aiding China.\" Chen condemned the Foreign Liquidation Commission's recent agreement to lend China between 150 million and 200 million US dollars to purchase American military surplus supplies in the Pacific. He said: The negotiations are currently being conducted by Song Ziwen with US Secretary of the Army Patterson and Foreign Liquidation Commission Director McCabe.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, August 28th: According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 26th, \"It has been learned here that the Shanghai office of the US Liquidation Commission has handed over ten American Mitchell medium bombers suitable for flight to the Chinese-operated China National Aviation Corporation. This move appears to be in direct violation of US federal regulations, which stipulate that no combat equipment may be sold without the approval of the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Central News Agency reported: Former commander of the US 14th Air Force in China, Major General Chennault, arrived in Shanghai by air from the United States on the 26th.

    "content": "How Much National Economic Sovereignty Did Chiang Kai-shek Sell Out?\n    Liao Gailong\n\n    From 1938 until the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the United States extended nine loans to China, totaling $1,247,800,000. Adding the cotton loan after the war ($33,000,000), the total was $1,280,800,000. The long-negotiated but not yet officially established new loan of $500,000,000 is not included.\n\n    Under the Lend-Lease Act, the United States lent Chiang Kai-shek's government armaments and other war materials worth over $1,500,000,000 to date (see the Associated Press dispatch from Washington on July 21), of which more than two-thirds were supplied after the end of the Anti-Japanese War. In fact, this is an investment by the US authorities in Chiang Kai-shek's civil war gamble.\n\n    Adding the above two items to the pre-war US investment in China of $340,000,000 (these assets have mostly returned to their original state after Japan's surrender), the total amounts to over $3,000,000,000, excluding other economic investments after the war.\n\n    As a result, the balance of power of various imperialist countries controlling China has been completely changed: According to reliable statistics, before the war in 1934, Japanese imperialist investment in China totaled $2,540,000,000, accounting for 53% of the total investment by the powers; British investment was $1,160,000,000, accounting for 24%; while the United States had only $340,000,000 in investment, accounting for only 7%. Now Japan's investment has been confiscated, and British investment in China is less than one-third of US capital in comparison, and cannot even maintain its original position. US capital monopolizes China under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and the joint domination of several major powers before the war has now become the monopoly of the United States alone.\n\n    Through the above huge loans, the US monopoly capital group has placed the financial power of Chiang Kai-shek's government under its control. For example, since 1944, they have replaced Britain in controlling the entire Chinese customs; since the Pacific War, British control over Chinese currency has also been completely eliminated by the United States. Before the war, in 1934-35, the equilibrium between the pound and the dollar, which was determined by the Anglo-American struggle for Chinese currency power, has, since the Pacific War, completely divorced the Chinese currency exchange rate from the pound and entered the dollar group. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the United States and Chinese reactionaries colluded, using their control over China's foreign exchange to stipulate a low exchange rate that facilitated the dumping of American goods (Chinese prices have risen more than 7,000 times, that is, the legal currency has depreciated to less than one-seven-thousandth, but the US exchange rate is set at 690 times the pre-war level, so the price of American goods within China is extremely low), forcing the Chinese people to bear a loss of more than 60 million US dollars per month in the national treasury, and the Kuomintang comprador bureaucrat capital group makes several times more profit than this by trafficking in American goods. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, US banks in China, with the help of US loans to Chiang Kai-shek, also obtained the right to operate in US dollars, completely restoring the pre-war situation in which Chinese currency circulation was divided by imperialism.\n\n    US monopoly capital is actively investing in and monopolizing various sectors of China's national economy. As early as the end of 1944, the United States sent a large number of technical advisors to carry out activities under the guise of assisting Chiang Kai-shek's government in establishing a \"Wartime Production Board.\" Last February, the US Foreign Economic Administration also published a \"Guide to China's Industrialization,\" which formulated a broad investment plan for China's mining, industry, and transportation, stipulating that in five years, it would \"assist\" in establishing 953 industrial and mining units, investing $972,430,000, and investing $897,630,000 in railway, highway, and river transportation, totaling $1,870,060,000. The implementation of this plan will allow all sectors of China's national economy to be completely and directly controlled by US monopoly capital. At the same time, British capital, which originally held a major advantage, will be excluded. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to the existing US enterprises in China - such as the China National Aviation Corporation, which is directed behind the scenes by Pan American Airlines, the Shanghai Electric and Gas Company and the telephone company of the Rockefeller system, etc. - having been restored to their original state, the aforementioned US investment plans and various investment activities are being actively carried out. The US trust Global Production Company has obtained the right to explore and extract oil beds in Northwest China, and there are already twenty-five oil wells working in the Gobi Desert, producing 4,000 barrels of oil per day. A group of American oil companies is forming a special enterprise combination (TASS dispatch on July 5), and Westinghouse Electric Corporation is signing a contract with the Kuomintang government to establish a large-scale factory in China. China's largest joint state-private shipping company, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (now owning more than 400,000 tons of ships), had already established ties with American capital before the war. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the company is, in fact, controlled by American capital, and a large number of management and technical personnel are Americans. The China Water Transport Team, owned by UNRRA (more than 75% of UNRRA's assets are owned by the United States), has been established and currently has more than 20,000 tons of ships, with plans to reach more than 200,000 tons. US Air Force General Chennault recently organized an air cargo company and, in conjunction with more than 30 agents of Chinese comprador bureaucrat capital, initiated the organization of the \"China Industrial Company,\" with capital of 100 million legal tender, which will monopolize the procurement and transportation of all important import and export commodities in China. The China Industrial Company will also establish branches in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, and other places, with its own vehicles and ships for transporting goods. Investment in railway and highway transportation is also being actively planned. In addition, US yarn mills, weaving, shipbuilding, chemical, cement, and flour factories will also appear in China.\n\n    Through the forms of sand, tin, and tung oil loans, US capital has gradually penetrated the Chinese countryside, directly grasping and seizing China's raw materials - agricultural products. In November last year, the \"International Trade Conference Recommendations\" drafted by the US State Department and adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in February this year stipulated that China should be an exporter of \"primary commodities\" (note: i.e., raw materials, mainly agricultural products) in international market relations, while the industrial products China needs should be imported from foreign countries. At the end of June this year, the \"Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group\" was formally established; When the head of the group, Shi Zhisheng, talked about the purpose of the group, he said: It will \"specially focus on studying the improvement and increased production methods of China's four agricultural products for export: silk, tea, wool, and tung oil.\" China is becoming a raw material supply factory monopolized by US monopoly capital.\n\n    As mentioned above, the reactionary financial capitalists and plutocrats of the United States are turning China into a country like Latin America, transforming China from a semi-colony jointly controlled by the monopolistic capital of the powers before the war into a vassal state and colony exclusively occupied by one country.\n\n    One hundred and five years ago, China failed in the Opium War and signed the Treaty of Nanjing, which guaranteed the export of imperialist goods to China and caused China to lose its customs barriers. Fifty years ago, we failed again in the Sino-Japanese War. In the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Qing emperor recognized the privilege of imperialism to establish factories in China, allowing the powers to smoothly carry out the export of capital to China and thus jeopardizing the development prospects of Chinese national capital. Thirty years ago, the traitor Yuan Shikai recognized Japan's Twenty-One Demands, stipulating a broad plan for Japanese investment in China, but Yuan Shikai was still wary of the fifth clause, which stipulated that China should hire Japanese as military, political, and economic advisors and that China and Japan should jointly run arsenals and police, and did not dare to recognize it. Now that China has won victory in the war against Japan, and the opportunity for China to lift the economic shackles of the imperialist powers for a century and independently and smoothly develop its national productive forces has arrived, the reactionary financial capital groups of the United States have obtained privileges exceeding the Treaty of Nanjing, the Treaty of Shimonoseki, and the Twenty-One Demands. What does this rely on? This relies on the \"cooperation\" of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. In order to exchange the military intervention of the reactionary financial capital of the United States as the only reliance for maintaining dictatorship and carrying out civil war, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries do not hesitate to auction off the future destiny of the entire nation, and the scale of its auction far exceeds the entire Qing Dynasty and Yuan Shikai.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石出卖了多少国家经济主权\n廖盖隆\n1946-08-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋介石出卖了多少国家经济主权\n    廖盖隆\n    自一九三八年至抗战结束时为止，美国对华贷款九次，金额共为十二万万四千七百八十万美元，加上抗战结束后的一次棉花借款（三千三百万美元），共为十二万万八千零八十万美元，洽商已久、迄未正式成立的五万万美元新借款还未计入。\n    在租借法案项下，美国借给蒋介石政府之军火及其他战争物资，迄最近为止，计值已达十五万万美元以上（见美联社七月二十一日华盛顿电），其中三分之二以上为抗战结束后所供给，实际上这乃是美国当局对蒋介石内战赌博的投资。\n    上述两项再加美国战前对华投资额三万万四千万美元（这些资产在日本投降后，已纷纷恢复旧观），总数已达三十万万美金以上，而抗战后的其他经济事业投资还未计入。\n    结果，各帝国主义国家控制中国的力量对比便整个改观：据可靠的统计，战前一九三四年，日本帝国主义在华投资共为二十五万万四千万美元，占列强投资额百分之五十三；英国投资十一万万六千万美元，占百分之二十四；而美国则仅有三万万四千万美元的投资，仅占百分之七。现在日本的投资被没收，英国在华投资，相形之下，已不及美国资本的三分之一，而且甚至不能保持其原有地位。美国资本独占了蒋介石统治下的中国，战前几个大列强的共同支配，现在已变为美国一国的独占。\n    美国垄断资本集团，通过上述巨大的借款，已把蒋介石政府的财政金融大权置于股掌之上。举例说：他们自一九四四年后，已取代英国而控制了整个中国的海关；自太平洋战争之后，英国对中国货币上的控制权，亦为美国所完全排除。战前一九三四——三五年，英美争夺中国货币权结果所确定的英镑与美元的均势，自太平洋战争后，中国货币汇率已完全脱离英镑而投入美元集团。抗战结束后，美国和中国的反动派勾结起来，利用其对中国外汇的控制，规定了一种便于美货倾销的低外汇（中国物价已涨七千多倍，亦即法币已跌值为七千分之一以下，但美汇被规定为战前的六百九十倍，因此美货在中国以内的价格极端低廉），使中国人民每月须负担美金六千万元以上的国库损失，而国民党买办官僚资本集团借贩运美货获利尤数倍于此。在抗战结束后，美国在华银行借美国对蒋介石借款之助，又取得了经营美钞的权利，完全恢复了战前中国货币流通被帝国主义所割裂的原状。\n    美国垄断资本正积极进行对中国国民经济各部门的投资与垄断活动。早在一九四四年底，美国即在协助蒋介石政府设立“战时生产局”名义下，派遣了大批的技术顾问进行活动。去年二月，美国对外经济供应局并发表了“中国工业化指南”一书，拟定一个对中国矿业、工业及运输交通的广泛投资计划，规定五年中“协助”建立工矿业九百五十三个单位，投资九万万七千二百四十三万美金，对铁路、公路、河流交通投资八万万九千七百六十三万美金，两项合计为十八万万七千零零六万美金。这一计划的实现，将使中国国民经济的各部门为美国垄断资本所完全直接支配。同时，原来占有主要优势的英国资本，将被排除出去。在抗战结束后，除了美国原有的在华企业——如在背后由泛美航空公司所指挥的中国航空公司、洛克菲尔系的上海电汽公司、电话公司等等已经恢复旧观之外，上述美国的投资计划与各种投资活动，正在积极进行。美国的大托拉斯环球生产公司，已获得在中国西北探测与采掘油床的权利，戈壁沙漠已有二十五个油井在工作，每天出油四千桶。美国石油公司的一群人，正在成立特别企业组合（七月五日塔斯社电），美威斯汀好斯电气公司正与国民党政府订合同，在华设立大规模之工厂。中国最大的官商合办的轮船公司——招商局（现在拥有四十多万吨船舶），在战前即已与美国资本发生联系，在抗战结束后，该公司事实上乃为美国资本所支配，大批的管理人员与技术人员均使用美国人。所有权属于联总（联总的财产百分之七十五以上为美国所有）的中国水运大队已经成立起来，现有轮船二万多吨，计划达到二十多万吨。美国空军将领陈纳德最近组织了一个航空运货公司，并联合了中国买办官僚资本的三十多个代理人，发起组织“中国实业公司”，资本达十万万法币，两者将垄断中国一切重要进出口的商货采办与运输。中国实业公司并将在南京、芜湖、九江、汉口、长沙、衡阳等地设立分公司，自备车船运输商货。铁路与公路的运输事业投资，也在积极策划。此外，美国的纱厂、织造、造船、化学、水泥、麦粉等工厂，亦将在中国出现。\n    通过了砂、锡、桐油等项借款的形式，美国资本已渐渐深入中国农村，直接掌握与攫取中国的原料——农产品。去年十一月，美国国务院所起草而在今年二月联合国经济社会理事会所通过的“国际贸易会议建议书”中，规定要中国在国际市场关系上，作为一个“原始商品”（按：即原料主要是农业品）的输出国，而中国所需的工业品则从外国输入。今年六月底，“中美农业技术合作团”已正式成立；团长此时生在谈到该团目的时说：将“特别着重研究中国出口之丝、茶、羊毛与桐油四种农产品之改良及增产方法”。中国正在成为美国垄断资本独占的原料供应厂。\n    如上所述，美国反动的金融资本财阀，正在把中国变成为像拉丁美洲那样的国家，把中国从战前列强垄断资本共同支配的半殖民地，更变成其一国所独占的附庸国和殖民地。\n    一百零五年以前，中国在鸦片战争中失败，订立了保证帝国主义对华输出商品的南京条约，使中国丧失了海关的壁垒。五十年前，中日战争我们又失败，在马关条约中，满清皇帝承认了帝国主义在华设厂的特权，使列强顺利遂行对华输出资本，并因此断送了中国民族资本的发展前途。三十年以前，卖国贼袁世凯承认日本帝国主义的二十一条，规定日本在华投资的广泛计划，但对其中规定中国须聘用日人为军事、政治、经济顾问，中日合办兵工厂及警察等的第五号条约，袁世凯也还有所顾忌，而不敢进行承认。现在中国在对日战争中赢得了胜利，中国解除百年来帝国主义列强的经济羁绊，独立地与顺畅地发展民族生产力的时机已经到来，但美国反动金融资本集团却获得了超过了南京条约、马关条约、二十一条的特权，这是依靠什么？这是依靠蒋介石反动派的“合作”。蒋介石反动派为着换得美国反动金融资本的军事干涉，作为维持独裁进行内战唯一的依靠，不惜拍卖整个民族的未来命运，而其拍卖的规模，大大超出了整个满清皇朝与袁世凯。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, August 28th: Following the attack on the \"Northern Jiangsu International Peace Hospital\" (located at the Lakeside Temple, seven miles northwest of Huai'an City) by four American-made Jiang Kai-shek planes on the afternoon of the 25th, two more American-made Jiang Kai-shek planes attacked the hospital again at 3:00 p.m. the next day (the 26th), making low-altitude continuous strafing runs for as long as 30 minutes. Thirty-three patients in the wards were hit by bullets, and two critically ill patients were further endangered due to excessive shock. Peng Baozhu, a farmer from Yulan Village, was wounded. When the Jiang planes were strafing at low altitude, American doctors at the hospital, Dr. Shelley, Dr. Gammany, and Dr. Muriel, witnessed bullets flying everywhere in the hospital and patients fleeing in terror. They were filled with indignation. It is said that since the establishment of the hospital, the location of the hospital and the process of its establishment have been telegraphed to the UNRRA offices in Peiping and Zhenjiang, and have been reported many times by the New China News Agency. The hospital is a purely medical relief organization founded by the China Welfare Fund Committee, hosted by Madame Soong Ching Ling, and assisted by UNRRA. It is already known to both Chinese and foreigners. Jiang Kai-shek's planes repeatedly use it as a target for attack, which is truly inhuman. Acting Deputy Director Ji Zhonghuan has now jointly requested the UNRRA office in Zhenjiang to lodge a serious protest with the Jiang Kai-shek side.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Suzhong Front, August 27th: After Jiang Kai-shek's troops invaded Rugao on July 23rd, they immediately guarded the four gates and stipulated that the common people were only allowed to enter and not allowed to leave. They also ordered merchants to open their businesses within three days, and those who violated the order would have their doors sealed and houses demolished. However, the merchants who were forced to open their doors, such as the Xia Yongxing shoe store in front of the former county government, had all 300 pairs of shoes looted as soon as they opened, in the name of \"comforting the refugees.\" Zhu He, who had served as the puppet town mayor, Zhang Conghou, the former puppet intelligence director, Huang Zhenghua, the puppet chamber of commerce director, and Qian Guoxun, who had served as a puppet soldier, were all appointed as township chiefs. After gaining power, they falsely accused Zhang Jingyu and five other residents of Liuyu Town in the west gate of fabricated crimes and \"beheaded them as a warning to others.\" More than 30 innocent people have been imprisoned in the black jail of Dinggan Temple. The people are arbitrarily arrested to build fortifications. Along the street of Laoba in the east gate, which is 30 li long, more than 20 large and small bunkers have been built. After the conscripted laborers complete the fortifications, they are ordered to supplement the troop strength. Dozens of villages in the suburbs, such as Matou Village, Wawutou, and Wangjia Alley, have been looted. All the crops are regarded as obstacles and are forcibly ordered to be cut down. On the evening of the 25th, Jiang Kai-shek's troops were catching chickens in a house in Wawutou. A child guarding the house held on and refused to let go, saying, \"The New Fourth Army has been here for so long and has never plucked a single chicken feather, but as soon as you come, you catch chickens.\" The Jiang Kai-shek soldiers became enraged and drew out their bayonets, stabbing the child in the chest more than a dozen times before forcibly taking the chicken away. Zhan's wife was tied up and raped, and hanged herself that night.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋机惨无人道！  再炸“苏北国际和平医院”如皋蒋军奸淫掳掠人民\n\n1946-08-31\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋机惨无人道！\n    再炸“苏北国际和平医院”\n    如皋蒋军奸淫掳掠人民\n    【新华社淮阴二十八日电】继廿五日下午美制蒋机四架袭击“苏北国际和平医院”院址（设淮安城西北七里之湖心寺）之后，次日（二十六）下午三时，又有美制蒋机两架，再度袭击该院，低飞连续扫射达三十分钟之久，病房三十三人中弹，重病人两名因过度惊骇，致病势益危，玉兰村农民彭保珠被击伤。当蒋机低空扫射时，该院美国医生薛利支、甘曼尼、慕美佩三人目睹院内流弹四飞，病人惊相奔避，愤恨万分。据说自该院成立后，即曾将院址及成立经过电告北平及镇江联总机关，并已由新华社报导多次。该院为中国福利基金委员会主持人宋庆龄氏募捐及联总协助所创立之纯粹医务救济机关，已属中外共知，蒋机竟再三以其为袭击目标，实属惨无人道。现已联名由代副院长济仲桓氏，请镇江联总办事处向蒋方提出严重抗议。\n    【新华社苏中前线廿七日电】蒋军于七月二十三日侵占如皋后，当即守住四门，规定老百姓只许进不准出，并限令商民于三日内一律开门营业，违者封门拆屋。但被迫开门的商家，原县政府门口夏永兴鞋店，满满三百双鞋子，刚开门就被一抢而空，所谓“慰劳难民”。如曾任伪镇长的祝贺、前伪情报主任张从厚、伪商会主任黄正华及当过伪军的钱国逊等，均被委为乡镇长。彼等得势后，诬西门六榆镇居民张敬余等六人莫须有的罪名“斩首示众”。定感寺黑牢中，已囚有无辜群众三十余人。民众被任意抓去修筑工事，仅东门老坝三十里路长一条街，即筑有大小碉堡二十余座。抓来民夫筑完工事后，即命令补充兵额。城郊数里之马头庄、瓦屋头、汪家巷等数十村庄，悉遭洗劫，所有庄稼均被视为障碍，强令一律砍光。二十五日傍晚，蒋军在瓦屋头某家捉鸡，一守家小孩拿住不放，他说：“新四军到这里，多少时候不曾拔一根鸡毛，你们一来就捉鸡。”蒋军恼羞成怒，拔出刺刀，对小孩胸部猛刺十数刀后，强夺鸡而去。詹氏才之妻被捆绑后，加以奸淫，当晚即悬梁自尽。"

    "content": "Reunion\n    Lang Qiao\n    After three days and four nights of fierce fighting – at three o'clock in the morning on the 18th – the heroic soldiers of the Eighth Route Army finally ascended the Zhao City wall, which was fortified with numerous bunkers. The Yan puppet troops hastily abandoned the city, wading across the Fen River in a disheveled state, like drowned chickens, leaving behind guns, mules, warhorses, and backpacks marked with \"Iron Army Group\" signs. American-style helmets, hats, leather boots, worn-out shoes… were floating on the water, sinking in the river, and thrown on the shore, scattered everywhere. However, they still could not escape being annihilated on the banks of the Fen River.\n\n    When the loud bugle call sounded from the city wall, the people of Zhao City, who had been hiding in their homes with trepidation, burrowing in wheat stacks, and hiding in earthen caves, emerged, excitedly shouting: \"Ah! Our troops are back, thank heavens, thank the earth, thank the spirits...\" Some were visiting, some were hurrying to boil water and soup, and some, hearing bullets whizzing overhead, retreated back under the eaves to wait quietly...\n\n    The troops went in turn to search the courtyards where the Yan puppet troops had resided. Citizens opened their doors, bringing out basins of boiled water. Some timid families had not yet opened their doors, but the troops did not force their way in. Instead, the people beside the doors called out: \"Our own people are back, quickly open the door!\" Some doors then opened with a \"creak.\" A thief took the opportunity to sneak into the Medicine King Temple, steal a package, and carry it out, but he was caught by the discipline team. After being persuaded, he returned the package. A monk who had been hiding in the grass outside the temple from the shelling saw this and told people the next day: \"This small matter shows how good the Eighth Route Army is!\"\n\n    Early in the morning, before the curfew was lifted, villagers were already waiting outside the city to enter. They had not been in the city for several years, and now they couldn't wait to fly in. Some, impatient, went around to the west city wall and crawled in through a water hole.\n\n    Many men, women, and children were vying to pick up shell casings, shouting and calling to each other, running back and forth. Men and women in the streets and alleys were talking and laughing happily, staring at the passing troops. Some were playing chess and competing to win at their doorsteps, and some young people were wrestling and playing. It was truly rare. Some people pasted red couplets on the walls, and the whole city seemed to be in a joyful New Year atmosphere, truly a delight for everyone.\n\n    An old woman was walking in the alley when she was approached by a comrade from the troops who asked her: \"Old lady, were you frightened?\" She smacked her lips and said loudly: \"I still want to scold you! Why didn't you come back after you left?!\" Then she smiled again, \"This time you can't leave, if you leave, we'll have to leave together!\"\n\n    When the political workers in the troops spoke in the streets and alleys, the people gathered around, endlessly recounting the pain Yan Xishan had inflicted on them. A middle-aged farmer surnamed Jia sighed and said: \"Alas! Yan Xishan is truly wicked. He'd rather waste ten old people to death than let one soldier die. When the troops entered, they took whatever they saw, and you didn't dare to ask a question. If something didn't please him, he'd kick and punch you, saying you were colluding with the 'rebellious Eighth'! The harvest from the fields wasn't enough for others, and they said Yan Xishan would 'reorganize' on the thirteenth, which worried people to death! No one was weeding the fields or applying fertilizer, wondering who would get their land. Fortunately, you came and saved everyone's lives. These days, they were forced to work day and night, making people's eyes bloodshot! Their whole bodies felt like the tendons had been pulled out. If you hadn't come in, people couldn't escape and would have all died.\"\n\n    The troops dispatched many comrades to visit the masses door-to-door to offer comfort, and every common person said with satisfaction: \"Our troops are really good!\"\n\n    Mr. Yao, a refined old gentleman from the carpentry shop on North Street, said: \"The army doesn't enter civilian houses. I've lived for decades, and this is the first time I've seen it with my own eyes. You can truly be called a 'benevolent and righteous army' that 'doesn't take a single needle or thread' from the people. You used your sincerity to win over the people, while Yan's army used bayonets to win over the people. You use politics to win people's hearts, which is why you can win battles.\"\n\n    The poor people in the northeastern corner of the city who made a living by carrying burdens couldn't do so these days and were forced to work all night. They had no food at home and had to provide meals for Yan's army. Hunger, fatigue, and worry were intertwined, and they were all sick in bed! Wang Guanzhu, an old man in his fifties, had been sick in bed for three days. When a comrade from our troops visited him, he suddenly jumped off the bed, grabbed the comrade's hand, and said excitedly: \"You came at the right time, this has cured my illness!\" He spoke and laughed, dancing and gesticulating in the room. \"My illness is cured, look, my illness is really cured.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 重逢\n朗樵\n1946-08-31\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　重逢\n    朗樵\n    经过三天四夜的激战——十八日早晨三点钟——英勇的八路健儿，终于登上碉堡林立的赵城城墙，阎伪军慌忙弃城，狼狈涉过汾河，像落汤鸡一样的把枪炮、驮骡、战马和挂有“铁军组”牌的背包，美式大圆盖、帽、皮靴、破鞋、……………丢的水上漂的，河里沈的，岸上扔的，到处都是。可是，他们仍逃跑不了被消灭在汾河畔上。\n    当城墙上嘹亮的号声一响，提心吊胆藏在家里的，钻在麦秸堆里的，躲在土窟窿里的赵城城内的老百姓，都钻出来兴奋的喊着：“呵呀！咱们队伍回来了，谢天、谢地、谢神灵…………”他们有的在看望，有的急忙烧水烧汤，有的听着子弹从头上掠过又躲回屋檐下静待…………。\n    队伍挨次到阎伪军曾住过的院子去搜查，市民们把门开开，将开水一盆盆端出来，胆小的人家还没有把门敞开，队伍也没人去推敲，门旁的老百姓却喊叫：“自己人回来了，快把门开开吧！”有的门就“吱呀”一声开开了。有一个小偷趁机钻进药王庙里偷了一包东西背出来，正碰见纠察队，经说服他又把东西送回了。在庙外草丛里躲炮弹的和尚看见了，天明便告人说：“这件小事情就知道八路军有多好！”\n    清早戒严令还未解除，城外已经有等着要进城的乡下人，他们有几年没有进城了，现在他们恨不得一下子飞进去，有的等得不耐烦就绕到西城墙，从一个水洞里钻进来。\n    许多男女小孩在争拾弹壳，你喊我叫，跑来跑去，街巷里男人女人都在愉快的说笑着，盯视过往的军队，有些人在门口下象棋斗胜负，有些青年人也在扭打闹玩，实在希罕，有人在门壁上贴上红对联，满城好像处在一个安乐的新年，真是皆大欢喜。\n    一个老婆正在巷子里走，迎面一个部队同志问她：“老太太可受惊了吧？”她咂一下嘴大声说：“我还要骂你们哩！为什你们一走就不回来了呢？！”接着她又笑了，“这回可不能走了，要走，咱们非一齐走不行！”\n    部队里的政工人员在街巷里一开口，老百姓就围拢上来，不停的不尽的给诉说阎锡山给他们的痛苦。一个姓贾的中年农民，叹气说：“唉！阎锡山真是坏透了，他＠肯糟塌死十个老百姓，也不肯死一个当兵的，军队进门见甚拿甚，问都不敢问一声。有一点不顺他的眼，就脚踢拳打，说你通“叛八”！地里打的还不够人家的，原说十三号阎锡山要“编组”，听了把人愁死啦！草也没人锄了，粪也没人上了，谁晓得把自己的地分给谁家呢？幸而你们又打来救了大家的命。这几天日夜支差，把人眼都熬红啦！浑身像抽了筋一样，你们不进来，人逃不出去，都要死完了。”\n    部队派了许多同志挨门挨户向群众慰问，每个老百姓都满意的说：“咱们队伍好着哩！”\n    北街板店一个文雅的姚老先生说：“军队不入民房，我活了几十年这是头一次，亲眼见到，你们真可谓“秋毫无犯”的“仁义之师”。你们拿出赤心换得老百姓，阎军拿刺刀换得老百姓，以政治服人心，所以你们能打胜仗。”\n    城东北角一带凭担挑谋生的穷人，这几天不能担挑谋生，还要整夜支差，家无宿夜粮，还要管阎军饭，饥饿、疲困、忧愁三者交加，都病倒床上了！五十多岁的王官柱老汉，已病在炕上三天，当我们一个部队同志慰问他时，忽地从炕上跳下来，就拉着这位同志的手，兴奋若狂的说：“你来的好，这一下把我的病问好了！……”他又说又笑就在屋里手舞足蹈起来。“我的病好了，你看我的病真好了。”\n        ＠"

This year, over ten thousand people from the surrounding dozens of *li* gathered to celebrate. There were twelve various lively performances and six theater troupes to add to the festivities, with content celebrating emancipation, opposing the civil war, and opposing Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country. A celebration meeting was held on the sixteenth, beginning with a report by Zhou Jiangfa, chairman of the Shimu Farmers' Association, on the village's emancipation struggle. He said, \"In Shimu, every family now has food to eat, everyone has clothes to wear, and every household has land to cultivate. We no longer suffer the hardships of the past. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we live a well-fed and clothed life. We will never forget the Communist Party for our emancipation, and we will never forget the Eighth Route Army for our liberation. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao!\" Emancipated farmer Xu Tianlin said, \"Our emancipation was not easy; it came after much struggle. Now the reactionaries want to seize our fruits and sell them to the United States. We must resolutely fight them to the end! We firmly oppose betraying the country!\" After recounting his own emancipation experience, veteran soldier Zhao Lianggen took out a letter from his pocket, intending to send it to Chairman Mao. The people of Shimu Village wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: \"Today is the anniversary of the day the people of Shimu Village were freed from the thousand-pound stone slab. We recall the unbearable suffering we endured under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the old society.
