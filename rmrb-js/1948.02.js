    "content": "Dongguan Production Good, But Turns Out to Be a False Report\n    All Regions Should Seriously Inspect\n    [Lucheng News] The First Production Team of Dongguan Village, Lucheng District (i.e., the team led by Wu委会主任杨毛孩, or Director of the Armed Forces Committee Yang Mao Hai), was previously considered the best of the four production teams in Dongguan Village. Every time they reported at the district office and joint defense meetings, the village cadres always said that all men, women, young, and old in the village were organized for production, and even those who were not moving were just lazy and difficult to motivate. The leaders, after hearing these reports, also believed that they had made achievements. Now, according to a careful visit and inspection by comrades working in the village, these good reports have turned out to be completely false.\n    (1) Landlords Control Mutual Aid Rights, and the Masses Dare Not Speak Up - The Sixth Group has a total of twenty-five households. Bankrupt landlord Zhao Chuncheng holds great power in the group. He and twelve poor and hired peasants and four middle peasants share a draught animal and a cart. The money earned by the cart and animal belongs to him, the poor and hired peasants do not get a penny, and they even have to contribute four *dou* of feed and two *jin* of oil each month. Poor hired peasant and military dependent Shi Heshang said, \"I have a share in this animal, but he doesn't let me pull the animal to turn the mill, only he is allowed to use it. He can scold anyone he wants in the group, and no one in the group dares to provoke him.\"\n    (2) Cadres Only Pay Lip Service, and the Difficulties of the Poor and Hired Cannot Be Solved - Poor hired peasant Li Xicun said: \"We can't compare with others. Their carts and horses are cheap and they have no difficulties. They earn money transporting goods outside every day, and we can only watch with envy.\" Hu Erzhi said: \"I don't even have a house now, and I have to pay rent for the house I live in.\" According to the investigation, there are twenty poor hired peasants without housing.\n    (3) Requiring Guarantors and Setting Deadlines, the Poor and Hired Cannot Get Loans - The First Production Team borrowed 250,000 yuan from the bank. It was stipulated that each person could only borrow 20,000 yuan, with a deadline of twenty days. As a result, the poor and hired were afraid that they would not be able to repay the loans on time and dared not borrow. Poor hired peasant Li Kedi said: \"When organizing production this winter, I planned to sell bowls, but I didn't have any capital. I went to the cooperative to borrow money, but the cooperative cadre only said: You can only borrow 20,000, and you have to find a guarantor. At that time, I asked Yang Laifu to guarantee me, and I borrowed 20,000 yuan. Twenty days later, I had only collected 10,000 yuan from selling bowls. They gave me five more days, but I still didn't have enough, so I was forced to sell one *shi* of soybeans to repay the loan.\" Li Xiaohai said: \"Three of us bought an ox and a cart. We used grain to buy the ox. It cost 80,000 to buy the cart. We asked the cooperative for a loan, but they only lent us 50,000. When the loan was due, we couldn't repay it, and they forced us to sell several *dou* of grain to repay the debt. People who have ways to repay on time can get loans from the cooperative. We can't repay on time, so the cooperative doesn't dare to lend to us.\"\n    Based on the above situation, the cadres were asked to conduct a self-criticism. The director of the Armed Forces Committee said: \"My work attitude in the past was just to brag every day, and I didn't personally go deep into leadership to understand the difficulties of the poor and hired. I just looked at the surface and thought it was okay, and I didn't know that there were so many problems inside. In the future, I must go deep to help the poor and hired.\" (Wu Changhong, Ma Lusheng)\n    Landlords engaging in speculation, the poor and hired suffering losses, village cadres making false reports, and leaders believing it due to bureaucratic tendencies. And then they say: \"Winter production has been started!\" This phenomenon probably exists in more than just Dongguan Village. We suggest that everyone put down their airs, truly go among the poor and hired masses to inspect, truly rely on them, and think of some ways to help them. The time for winter production is not long, and we need to give it one last push.——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东关生产搞的好原来是个假报告  各地都应该认真检查\n吴长洪  马潞生\n1948-02-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    东关生产搞的好原来是个假报告\n    各地都应该认真检查\n    【潞城消息】一区潞城东关村第一生产大队（即武委会主任杨毛孩领导的大队），过去被认为是东关村四个生产大队中最好的一个。每次在区公所和联防会上汇报，村干部总是说全村男女老少都组织起来生产了，即有个别不动弹的，那都是懒汉，不好发动。领导上听了这种报告，也认为就是搞的有成绩。现据该村工作同志仔细访问检查，发现这些好报告原来全是假的。\n    （一）地主掌握互助权，群众有话不敢谈——第六组共有二十五户，破产地主赵春成在组中掌握大权，他和十二户贫雇、四户中农伙着一个牲口一辆车，车和牲口赚下钱都是他的，贫雇农民得不上分文，并且每月还得贴四斗料二斤油。贫雇军属史和尚说：“这个牲口有我一份，牵上牲口推推磨他还不让，只许他一个人使。在组内想骂谁就骂谁，组内谁都不敢惹。”\n    （二）干部光说嘴，贫雇困难不能解决——贫雇李喜存说：“咱不能和人家比。人家车马便宜，没啥困难，每天在外运输赚钱，咱在一边光眼气。”胡二只说：“我现在连房子也没有，住的房子还得给人家出赁钱。”据调查，没房住的贫雇就有二十个。\n    （三）找保限期，贫雇贷不上款——第一生产大队从银行贷款二十五万元。规定每人只贷二万元，期限二十天。因此影响贫雇怕到期归还不了，不敢贷款。贫雇李喜的说：“今冬组织生产时，我计划卖碗，但又没本钱。我到合作社贷款，合作社干部科只说：只能贷两万，还让找了个保。当时我找杨来富保住，贷了两万元。二十天到期了，卖碗只凑了一万，人家又缓了我五天，结果还没有凑够，逼得卖了一石豆子才把款还了。”李小孩说：“我三人买了一头牛、一辆车。买牛出的粮食。买车花了八万。让合作社贷款，人家只贷给五万，到期还不起，人家逼得咱卖了几斗粮食，才算还了帐。人家有法的到期都能还了，合作社也敢贷给他。咱到期还不了，合作社不敢贷给咱们。”\n    根据以上情况，便让干部来进行检讨。武委会主任说：“我过去的工作态度是每天光吹，就没亲自去深入领导，了解贫雇困难。光看到表面就算啦，不知道里边还存在这么些问题，今后一定要深入帮助贫雇。”（吴长洪、马潞生）\n    地主投机捣鬼，贫雇困难吃亏，村干部作假报告，领导上官僚主义的信以为真。于是说：“冬季生产搞起来了！”这种现象，恐怕不只东关一个村子有。我们建议大家放下架子，真正到雇贫群众中检查检查，真正依靠他们，给他们想些办法。冬季生产时间已经不长，需要鼓最后一把劲了。      ——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Kyiv dispatch: This month on the 24th, for the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, grand meetings were held throughout Ukraine to celebrate warmly. Molotov personally went to Kyiv to participate in the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's commemorative ceremony and, on behalf of the Soviet government, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and Stalin, extended congratulations to the Ukrainian people. Kyiv also held a grand military parade and a mass parade with 300,000 participants.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Kyiv dispatch: Molotov delivered a lengthy speech at the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's celebration of the 30th anniversary of the founding of Ukraine, praising the great achievements of the Ukrainian people over the past thirty years. Molotov first pointed out: \"The anniversary of the founding of Ukraine is a day of great significance to the Ukrainian people and all the people of the Soviet Union, and it has great international significance. The October Socialist Revolution liberated the people of old Russia from the shackles of capitalism and opened up the road to communism and a free and happy life for the people of the world. The Ukrainian people were the first to embark on this path after the Russian people. After embarking on the Soviet path, the Ukrainian people finally realized their long-cherished dream of establishing a nationally independent Ukrainian state, thus leading Ukraine into a new and truly glorious century.\" After tracing the arduous struggle of the Ukrainian people over the past thirty years against armed intervention and the German aggressors, Molotov praised Ukraine's rapid recovery and leaps and bounds progress after the war, saying: \"The whole world knows that Ukraine is the birthplace of the famous Stakhanovite movement. At present, the movement to strive to complete the five-year plan in four years is flourishing. Ukrainian science and art are victoriously overcoming anti-people bourgeois influences and are gaining more universal respect among the Soviet and world people. The great hardships and trials of the Patriotic War are a clear testament to the strong will, political unity, and unwavering loyalty of the Ukrainian people to the Soviet government and the Ukrainian Bolsheviks. Now we know that the Ukrainian people and their vanguard, the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party, have gloriously passed all the tests.\" Molotov then pointed out: All Ukrainian territories, including Western Ukraine, Transcarpathian Ukraine, and Northern Bukovina, formerly belonging to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, are now united. \"The current population of Ukraine is virtually equal to that of the largest countries in Europe.\" Molotov emphasized: The Ukrainian border has undergone major changes, having been surrounded by reactionary semi-fascist regimes in the past, but now it is adjacent to people's democratic regimes. \"All this proves that the Leninist-Stalinist principles of nationalities policy have produced brilliant results. The Soviet regime has enabled the Ukrainian people to realize in the shortest period of time the dreams that could not be realized before capitalism was overthrown and the international prestige of socialism was not yet remarkable.\" Molotov concluded: \"The Ukrainian people and the various nationalities of the Soviet Union are united in a plan to strive for the development and strengthening of their motherland, and this plan is a guarantee for the victorious advancement of the Soviet people. We believe that our domestic strength can serve as a reliable bulwark for the independence of our motherland. Our peace-loving people will fight to achieve lasting and enduring peace and national security. This is the basic task of Soviet Stalinist foreign policy. I believe that all the Ukrainian people will fully and resolutely support the Soviet government's and the Bolsheviks' domestic and foreign policies.\" Molotov's speech ended in a chorus of slogans, repeatedly eliciting thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 乌克兰建国三十周年纪念  莫洛托夫发表演说  赞扬斯大林民族政策辉煌成果\n\n1948-02-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    乌克兰建国三十周年纪念\n    莫洛托夫发表演说\n    赞扬斯大林民族政策辉煌成果\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】基辅讯：本月二十四日，为乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国建国三十周年纪念，乌克兰各地均举行大会，热烈庆祝。莫洛托夫为此亲临基辅，参加乌克兰最高苏维埃纪念典礼，并代表苏联政府、联共中央及斯大林，向乌克兰人民致贺。基辅并举行盛大军事检阅与三十万人参加之大游行。\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】基辅讯：莫洛托夫在乌克兰最高苏维埃庆祝乌克兰建国三十周年纪念会上，发表长篇演说，赞扬乌克兰人民三十年来之伟大成就。莫氏首先指出：“乌克兰建国纪念日，对乌克兰人民及全苏联一切人民，都是具有极大意义的日子，并具有极伟大的国际意义。十月社会主义革命给旧俄人民解脱了资本主义的枷锁，为全世界人民开辟了通到共产主义，通到自由幸福生活的大道。乌克兰人民是在俄罗斯人民以后第一个走上了这个道路的。乌克兰人民在走上苏维埃道路以后，终于实现了它多年的梦想，建立了一个民族独立的乌克兰国家，因此将乌克兰导入一个新的、真正光荣的世纪”。莫氏在追溯乌克兰人民三十年来反抗武装干涉与德国侵略者所作的艰苦斗争后，赞许乌克兰在战后的迅速复兴与飞跃进展称：“全世界都知道乌克兰是著名的斯达哈诺夫运动的发祥地。目前争取四年完成五年计划的运动，正在蓬勃开展中，乌克兰科学艺术正在胜利克服反人民的资产阶级影响，并在苏联和世界人民中获得更普遍的尊重，爱国战争的巨大艰难困苦与考验，是乌克兰人民意志坚强、政治团结和矢忠于苏维埃政府与乌共布尔什维克意志坚定的明证。现在我们知道乌克兰人民及其先锋队乌克兰布尔什维克党，已经光荣地通过了一切考验”。莫氏继之指出：所有乌克兰的领土，包括前属波兰、捷克与罗马尼亚的西乌克兰、外喀尔巴阡乌克兰、北布科维纳，现在已联合在一起，“目前乌克兰人口，实际上已等于欧洲最大国家的人口”。莫氏力称：乌克兰边疆已起了重大变化，过去为反动半法西斯政权所包围，而现在已与人民民主政权为邻，“这一切都证明列宁、斯大林民族政策原则已产生了辉煌成果。苏维埃政权使乌克兰人民在资本主义被推翻前社会主义的国际威信尚未卓著以前所不能实现的梦想，在最短时期得到实现”。莫氏最后指出：“乌克兰人民与苏联各族人民已为争取他们祖国力量的发展与加强而团结在一个计划中，这个计划是苏联人民胜利前进的保证。我们相信我们的国内力量可以作为我们祖国独立的可靠堡垒。我们爱好和平的人民将为获致巩固与持久的和平与国家安全而斗争。这就是苏联斯大林外交政策的基本任务。我相信乌克兰全体人民都将完全和坚决支持苏联政府与布尔什维克的内外政策的”。莫氏演讲在高呼口号声中结束，演讲中曾屡次激起雷动的掌声与热烈的欢呼。"

The Iranian newspaper Mardom criticized the Hakimi cabinet as \"a symbol of anti-Sovietism,\" and insisted that he \"should not be the Prime Minister.\" The secret democratic radio station of Azerbaijan Province has been broadcasting against Hakimi's appointment as Prime Minister for days. It is reported that Hakimi was ordered by the Shah to form a cabinet to replace the Sultani cabinet. Sultani instigated the parliament to overturn the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement in October last year, which aroused increasingly fierce opposition from the entire Iranian people, and the Democratic Party he led also split as a result. After the parliament voted against him, Sultani finally had to tender his cabinet's resignation. Afterwards, through the extensive activities of the agents of American and British imperialism in Tehran, Hakimi's reactionary new cabinet was formed. Hakimi is a notorious anti-Soviet and pro-imperialist element. As early as 1919, when he was the foreign minister, he submitted a preposterous memorandum to the Paris Peace Conference demanding the acquisition of Soviet Azerbaijan and Turkoman territories. In 1945, when Hakimi served as Prime Minister, he was forced to step down due to his cruel suppression of the independence movement in Iranian Azerbaijan Province and his fanatical anti-Sovietism.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Various sources report: The Paris weekly \"World Forum\" recently published an article exposing the inside story of former British Foreign Secretary Eden's \"sightseeing trip\" to Iran on the 28th of last month, stating: Eden's purpose in going to Iran was to prevent the US government's conspiracy to seize Britain's oil privileges in Iran. Prior to this, the United States and Britain had negotiated their oil interests in the Middle East and Near East in Washington. The British Ambassador to the United States strongly prevented the United States from influencing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company treaty in its negotiations with Iran, and stated: \"Britain relies on its privileges to obtain more than 19 million tons of oil from Iran every year, and therefore will never tolerate any modification of the above-mentioned treaty.\" However, the recent US Ambassador to Iran openly suggested that the Iranian government revise this treaty, and stated that the United States intends to purchase shares in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and advocates the establishment of a new US-Iranian or Anglo-American-Iranian oil company. Eden's trip to Iran was to try to save this aggressive situation. The behind-the-scenes struggle between the United States and Britain in Iran has recently intensified due to the United States' strengthening of its control over Iran. In November last year, the United States' proposal for an International Bank loan of 250 million US dollars to Iran not only aroused widespread opposition from the Iranian people, but was also openly criticized by the British Ambassador to Iran.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 伊人反对哈基米新阁  英美明争暗斗抢掠伊朗油田\n\n1948-02-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    伊人反对哈基米新阁\n    英美明争暗斗抢掠伊朗油田\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】德黑兰讯：伊朗人民激烈反对上月二十八日组成之哈基米内阁。伊朗玛报斥哈基米内阁“为仇苏之象征”，力主“不应作总理”。阿塞拜疆省秘密民主电台连日作反对哈氏任总理之广播。按哈基米系奉伊王＠命组阁，以代替苏尔坦尼内阁，苏氏因于去年十月间唆使国会推翻苏伊石油协定，引起全伊人民日趋激烈之反对，其领导之民主党亦因此分裂，在国会对他投不信任票后，苏氏终不得不提出内阁总辞职。自后，经美英帝国主义在德黑兰之代理人大肆活动，哈基米反动新阁始告组成。哈氏是臭名昭著的仇苏亲帝分子，早在一九一九年外长任内，即曾向巴黎和会提出要求取得苏境阿塞拜疆及土耳克曼领土之狂妄备忘录。一九四五年时哈氏出任总理，因其对伊北阿塞拜疆省独立运动之残酷压迫与疯狂仇苏而为人民反对被迫下台。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方讯：巴黎“世界论坛”周刊，顷著文揭露英前外相艾登于上月二十八日赴伊朗作“观光旅行”之内幕称：艾登赴伊之目的，是想阻止美国政府攫取英国在伊石油特权之阴谋。在此以前，美英曾在华盛顿谈判两国在中东与近东之石油权益，英驻美大使曾力阻美国在与伊朗谈判中影响及英伊石油公司条约，并声称：“英国赖其特权，每年自伊朗取得之石油达一千九百余万吨，因此决难容忍对上述条约之任何修改”。然最近美驻伊大使公开建议伊政府修改此项条约，并称：美国拟购买英伊石油公司之股票，且主建立新的美伊或英美伊石油公司。艾登赴伊即为图挽救此种咄咄逼人之局势。美英在伊朗之暗斗，近来已因美国加强其对伊控制而日趋激烈。去年十一月间，美国建议国际银行贷款在伊朗两亿五千万美元一事，不仅引起伊朗人民普遍反对，英驻伊大使亦予公开抨击。"

Although the previous relief effort was carried out, it is still not enough to survive and affects production to overcome the famine. In order to urgently aid the disaster victims, support the production of poor peasants and hired laborers, and overcome the famine, the government has specially allocated 400 shi of millet to relieve the poor people and disaster victims in Chengguan and the surrounding areas who have not yet turned over. To ensure that the relief grain truly reaches the hands of the poor peasants and hired laborers who have no way to live, the government and the Relief Association convened a representative meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers from the villages to be relieved (all upright and honest poor peasants and hired laborers) on the 18th of this month, with 217 people from 62 villages attending. Everyone took charge to discuss how to distribute the relief. It was clearly determined that in order to make the relief fair, it is necessary to convene an upright meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers to discuss and decide who should be allocated and who should not, entirely decided by the poor peasants and hired laborers, and no one can restrict or interfere. Whether village cadres and militia members should be relieved or not should also be entirely decided by the meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers, and no one should grab a handful or take more than their share. After the meeting, the representatives were all very happy and said, \"In the past, no one looked up to us, but now we are going to be masters!\" Several old men said, \"We have lived such long lives, and we have never even entered the yamen. People often say: the yamen gate faces south, those with reason but no money cannot enter. We poor people cannot enter the yamen at all, but now it has become our yamen, calling on us to produce well and overcome this famine year.\" At the same time, the Special Commissioner's Office also sent several cadres to bring 10 million yuan in loans to lend to disaster victims in the New District for spinning, weaving, transportation, and small businesses, which must also be done through the poor peasants and hired laborers, and lent to the poor peasants and hired laborers.\n    [Another Message] The poor people in Chengguan and the surrounding villages are hungry, and they cannot even get turnips to eat every day. However, it has recently been discovered that of the relief grain issued by the county government last time, 100 shi are still stored in the original village in Chengguan District, and 20 shi are stored in Xiguan and have not been distributed. Chengguan District should thoroughly investigate the reasons for this lack of concern for the suffering of the poor, conduct a profound self-criticism, and distribute this grain immediately.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 元氏拨粮救济灾民  贫雇作主直接发放  上次救济粮没发完，要很好检查。\n\n1948-02-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    元氏拨粮救济灾民\n    贫雇作主直接发放\n    上次救济粮没发完，要很好检查。\n    【元氏消息】元氏五、六、七区及城关新区，因今年年头不好，再加上蒋匪魏永和灾，广大群众尤其是贫雇已经饿起肚子。虽经过上次的救济，但仍不能过下去，影响生产渡荒。政府为了急救灾民，扶持贫雇生产，渡过灾荒，特拨谷子四百石，救济城关及城周没翻过身的贫民灾民。为使救济粮真正发到没法生活的贫雇手里，政府和救联会在本月十八日召开了应救济村庄的贫雇代表会（都是正派的老实贫雇），到会六十二村二百一十七人。大家作主商讨如何分配救济。明确确定了要想救济的公平，必须召开正派的贫雇会，讨论决定谁应分谁不应分，完全由贫雇作主，任何人不能限制干涉。村干部民兵该救济不该救济也完全由贫雇会来决定，不得抓一把或多分。会后各代表都很高兴的说：“过去没人看得起咱，现在要当家作主呀！”几个老头说：“咱活了这么大年纪，连衙门口没进过。人常说：衙门口朝南开，有理没钱进不来。咱穷人根本进不了衙门口，现在成了咱们的衙门口，叫咱很好生产，渡过这个荒年”。同时，专署也派几个干部带来一千万元贷款，贷给新区灾民纺织、运输、干小买卖，也一定要通过贫雇，贷到贫雇手里。\n    【又息】城关及城周各村穷人饿着肚皮，每天连蔓菁还吃不到嘴里。但近来发现，上次县政府所发下的救济粮，城关区尚在原庄存着一百石，在西关存着二十石没发。这种不关心穷人痛苦的事，城关区应很好检查原因，进行深刻检讨，把这项粮食马上救济下去才好。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Paris Dispatch: A wave of resistance against the Franco-American treacherous treaty and the oppressive new tax law is rapidly spreading throughout France. In Dunkirk County, northern France, 1,000 farmers gathered on the 27th, and with great indignation, passed a resolution strongly protesting the \"Meyer Law.\" Mass rallies were held everywhere in Angers, Doudeville, and Souillac, fiercely attacking the Schumann government's anti-people actions. Associations of merchants, artisans, farmers, and freelance professionals in Souillac have unanimously refused to pay the new tax. A mass protest meeting of artisans, craftsmen, and small and medium-sized businesses was held in the Seine Province a few days ago. French Communist Party leader Duclos declared at the meeting: \"The French Communist Party will support the workers' actions and fully oppose the Meyer Law.\" On the 26th, French Communist Party deputies submitted a bill to the National Assembly demanding the immediate abolition of the disastrous new tax law. The Franco-Soviet Friendship Association held a conference in Paris on the 21st. The chairman of the conference, Joliot-Curie, denounced \"the conspiracy of the gold dollar imperialism to enslave France.\" He emphasized: \"It would be a serious mistake to place all hope in the United States. France can only guarantee its independence by trading with other countries, including the Soviet Union.\" French democratic newspapers have also risen up to denounce the situation. L'Humanité wrote on the 25th that Schumann, Moch, Meyer, and their masters, the big capitalists, are dragging all levels of French society into poverty. The French government has never been so subservient to the orders of the United States as it is now. The Marshall Plan and the Meyer Plan have only one purpose: to destroy French agriculture, commerce, and small industry. The newspaper pointed out: \"Unemployment has spread throughout France. In the construction industry alone, there are more than 180,000 unemployed.\" A large number of members of the Socialist Party are also deeply dissatisfied with the party's treacherous policy of completely following the reactionary authorities and selling themselves out. More than 60 members of the Globus Local Committee of the Socialist Party issued a statement on the 21st, collectively leaving the party. They condemned \"the Socialist Party for betraying the cause of socialism\" and announced: \"We are loyal to the cause of working-class unity.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对法美卖国协定和“新税收法”  法国到处开群众大会\n\n1948-02-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    反对法美卖国协定和“新税收法”\n    法国到处开群众大会\n    【新华社陕北卅日电】巴黎讯：抗拒法美卖国协定和残民的新税收法的浪潮，迅速蔓延全法。法北部敦刻尔克县一千农民于二十七日集会，满怀激愤地通过决议，大声抗议“迈耶法案”。昂斯、杜德拉和苏利斯等地，到处举行群众大会，猛烈攻击舒曼政府的反人民行动。苏利斯的商人、手艺工人、农民和自由职业者等协会，已一致拒绝缴纳新税。赛纳省于日前举行了工匠、手艺工人和中小商业者的群众性抗议大会，法共领袖之一杜克洛在会上宣称：“法共将支持工人们的行动，全力反对迈耶法案”。法共议员并于二十六日向国民议会提出一法案，要求立即废除引起灾难的新税收法。法苏友谊协会于二十一日在巴黎召开大会，大会主席居利力斥“金元帝国主义奴役法国的阴谋”。他强调指出：“把一切希望寄托在美国身上，将是严重的错误。法国只有与包括苏联在内的其他各国进行贸易，才能保证法国的独立”。法国民主报纸也纷起声斥。人道报二十五日撰文称：舒曼、摩许、迈耶及其主子大资本家们，正将法国各阶层拖入贫困中。法国政府从未如现在那样屈从于美国的命令，马歇尔计划和迈耶计划只有一个目的，即毁灭法国的农业、商业与小工业。该报指出：“失业已遍及全法，仅在建筑业中，失业者就有十八万以上”。社会党内广大党员对该党完全尾随反动当局卖身投靠的叛变政策，也大表不满。社会党格洛布地方委员会的六十余个党员，于二十一日发表声明，集体脱离该党，他们谴责“社会党出卖了社会主义事业”，并宣布：“我们忠实于工人阶级的团结事业”。"

The general idea is that the labor service grain burden of workers should be collected by the governments of the locations where the factories are located. We have also received orders from the Taihang Third Administrative Office and Changzhi City that, starting from November of last year, the labor service grain of factory workers in our city should be handed over to the Changzhi Municipal Government, and villages should not be allowed to collect it. We have implemented this order, but the villages of origin of the workers have not implemented it accordingly, and they are still collecting it, and there are phenomena of over-collection. Such as Qingliu Village, Hancun Village, Guangbi Village in Huguan County, and Chenjiazhuang, Southwest Cheng, etc. in Changzi County. There are also other counties like this. This results in workers bearing a double burden, making them uneasy about their work. We have also sent official letters to negotiate on this matter, but after many exchanges, they have not been effective. Therefore, I request your help in solving this problem. Is it that the county governments have not conveyed the order of the Taihang Third Administrative Office? Or perhaps the districts and villages have not implemented this order? The relevant county, district, and village cadres should strictly check and pay attention to such irresponsible work styles of not implementing orders.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 壶关长子等县  是否多收了工人支差米？\n\n1948-02-01\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n    壶关长子等县\n    是否多收了工人支差米？编辑同志：\n    太行行署去年十二月有命令，决定工厂工人劳力负担办法。大意是工人的支差负担米，由各工厂所在地的政府征收。我们并已接到太行三专署及长治市命令，从去年十一月份起，本市工厂工人的支差米交给长治市政府，各村不得征派。这个命令我们执行了，而工人原籍各村并未照此执行，仍然派收，且有多派的现象产生。如壶关县清流村、韩村、广壁村，及长子县陈家庄、西南呈等。还有其他县也如此。这样一来，使得工人出双重负担，工作不安心。这种事情，我们亦曾去公函交涉，但往还多次，也有不发生效力的。因此，我请求你们帮助解决。是不是各县政府未传达太行三专署命令？或许是各区、村未执行这个命令？象这样对命令不执行，不负责的工作作风，有关各县、区、村干部应严格检查注意才是。"

Recently, the organization of poor and hired peasants to study the Land Law, through the feedback and preliminary examination of poor and hired peasants, found that the landlords in this village were not thoroughly 斗争斗. The local tyrant landlord Miao Haoqiu still has thirty-one mu of good fertile land, a fourteen-room two-story building, and seventeen rooms with a brick courtyard. Landlord Cao Guaigou has fifty-four mu of good land, a large cart, and a donkey. The grain yield of these lands is eight dou to one shi and three dou of good grain. According to preliminary investigations: ten landlord households and six rich peasant households still have four hundred and three mu of land, one hundred and sixty-six rooms in two-story buildings, four and a half large carts, and seven and a half livestock.

Now is the time to turn over; we are still living outside the village.\" The reasons why the landlords in this village were not thoroughly 斗争斗 are as follows, according to investigations: (1) Some were cadres in the past. (2) Some were veterans. (3) Some brothers falsely divided the family property to disguise themselves. (4) Some were afraid of being drafted into the army if they were 斗争斗, and were considered dependents of soldiers. During the 斗争斗, some offered a little grain, and some donated a little land, pretending to be enlightened.

Section Chief Zhang asked him, \"Aren't you the Deputy Division Commander?\" \"I can swear, I really am not the Deputy Division Commander.\" Then he raised his left hand and said, \"I, Cheng Hualong...\" Unexpectedly, in his haste, he blurted out his real name, causing a burst of laughter in the room. At this point, Cheng Hualong looked extremely embarrassed and had to say, with a red face, \"If the Section Chief says I am, what can I do?\"\n    Section Chief Zhang took him to live in the room for officers at the rank of colonel. He was afraid that other officers would call out his real name, so as soon as he entered the door, he introduced himself, \"I am a Second Lieutenant clerk, and they insist that I am the Deputy Division Commander.\" Liu Angfen, the commander of the 128th Regiment, who was sleeping on the kang, suddenly jumped off the kang and pretended to be very familiar, saying, \"Isn't this Clerk Dian?\" \"No, my surname is not Dian, my surname is Zhang.\" He was afraid that Liu Angfen would mispronounce his name, so he hurriedly added, \"My name is Zhang Yuxin.\" The room burst into laughter again. Chen Mengxie, the Deputy Commander of the 123rd Regiment, wanted to ease the atmosphere and said, \"Stop pretending, get on the kang and sleep.\" \"No, I am not the Deputy Division Commander.\" \"Even if you are not the Deputy Division Commander, you still have to sleep.\" After Chen Mengxie finished speaking, there was another burst of laughter in the room. Cheng Hualong refused to get on the kang and fell asleep on the ground. The next day, after Chiang's New 5th Army Major General Commander Chen Linda and 195th Division Major General Deputy Division Commander Yan Ziyun were discovered, Section Chief Zhang called Cheng Hualong again. As soon as he entered the door, he said, \"You must say I am the Deputy Division Commander. Who will testify?\" \"You want proof?\" Section Chief Zhang said, \"You are too ungrateful. Is there really no one to testify?\" Cheng Hualong still wanted to evade and deny it, but Chen Linda, who was sitting next to him, glanced at him, and he stopped talking and sat there blankly, then burst into tears: \"I admit it, what will happen to my family?\" Section Chief Zhang tried his best to comfort him and promised to forward a letter to his family, and he stopped crying.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “我不是副师长”  四十九师程化龙被俘丑态\n常工\n1948-02-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    “我不是副师长”\n    四十九师程化龙被俘丑态\n    【新华社东北二十八日电】分社记者常工报导：沈北战役后，解放军在俘虏群中查出蒋匪四十三师少将副师长程化龙（前误陈化龙）的经过情形。\n    程化龙湖北天门人，现年三十六岁，蒋记中央军校七期毕业。当解放军某部张科长和他谈话时，他假称是湖南人，今年四十五岁，名叫张玉新，是搜索连的中尉司书。张科长问他：“你不是副师长吗？”“我可以发誓，我真不是副师长。”接着他就把左手一举说：“我程化龙………”没想到他一着急，便把真姓名讲出来了，引起屋内哄堂大笑，这时，程化龙窘态毕露，只好红着脸说：“科长说我是，我有啥办法”？\n    张科长把他带到校级军官房内去住，他生怕其他军官喊出他的真实姓名，一进门就自我介绍说：“我是中尉司书，他们硬说我是副师长”。睡在炕上的一二八团团附刘昂芬忽然从炕上跳下来，故意装作很熟的样子说：“这不是典司书吗”？“不，我不姓典，我姓张”。他怕刘昂芬把他的名字说错了，又急忙补充说：“我叫张玉新”。房内又哄笑起来。一二三团副团长陈孟谐想缓和一下空气说：“别装模作样了，上炕睡觉吧”。“不，我不是副师长”。“不是副师长也得睡觉呵”。陈孟谐说完，房内又是一阵哄笑。程化龙没肯上炕，就在地上倒下睡了。第二天蒋匪新五军少将军长陈林达和一九五师少将副师长阎资筠被查获后，张科长又把程化龙传来，他一进门又说：“你们一定说我是副师长谁作证明”？“你要证明吗？”张科长说：“你太不识抬举了，难道真没有人证明吗？”程化龙还想支唔抵赖，坐在旁边的陈林达向他瞅了一眼，他才不做声呆呆的坐下了，接着哇哇的哭了起来：“我承认了，我的家怎办呀？”张科长极力安慰他，并答应为他转家信他才收住了哭。"

The third campaign unfolded at Xinlitun, an important railway junction west of Shenyang. Our army's attack on the enemy's 26th Division of the 49th Army, which was surrounded, began at 7:00 AM on the 25th. After a day of fighting, we swept away all the enemy outposts around Xinlitun. The enemy, entrenched in strong fortifications and bunkers, were intimidated by the might of our army and attempted to break out of the city in three routes at 4:00 AM on the 26th. One part was compressed into the city by our forces, and after four hours of street fighting, they were completely annihilated. The enemy fleeing from the northeast, northwest, and southwest of the city were caught in the trap we had set only ten miles outside the city, and were captured and annihilated one by one in the frozen wilderness by our various armies. A few remaining enemies who slipped through and fled to Sandao Gou south of Xinlitun were also intercepted by our local forces. The battle ended completely at 4:00 PM on the 26th. Throughout this battle, no enemy troops came to reinforce them. The battle was resolved quickly, and at the cost of only minimal casualties on our part, we completely annihilated an entire enemy division and occupied Xinlitun, a strategic point west of Shenyang.

    "content": "Some people believe that as long as the correct line of the Party is laid down, announced to everyone, described in the form of general outlines and resolutions, and unanimously adopted, it is enough for victory to come automatically, so-called spontaneously. This is, of course, incorrect. This is a huge misconception. Only incorrigible bureaucrats can think this way. In fact, these achievements and victories did not come spontaneously, but were obtained in a fierce struggle to implement the Party's line. Victory never comes on its own—it is usually won through people's struggles. Good resolutions and declarations supporting the Party's general line are only the beginning because they can only express the desire to achieve victory, not the victory itself. After the correct line has been put forward and the correct solution to the problem has been proposed, whether things are effective depends on organizational work, on the organizational struggle to implement the Party's line, on the correct selection of personnel, and on reviewing the implementation of decisions by leading organs. Without this, the Party's correct resolutions risk suffering significant losses. Moreover, after a correct political line has been established, organizational work determines everything, including the fate of the political line itself—its implementation or failure. In fact, the reason we have achieved and obtained victories is that we have carried out a systematic and fierce struggle against the various difficulties in implementing the Party's line, because we have overcome these difficulties, mobilized the Party and the working class to overcome difficulties, organized the struggle to overcome difficulties, replaced unsuitable personnel, and selected excellent personnel capable of fighting against difficulties…\n\nRegarding the removal of incorrigible bureaucrats and red-tape merchants, we have no disagreements. Besides these people, we also have two types of personnel who hinder our work, obstruct our work, and prevent us from moving forward.\n\nThe first type of personnel are those who had considerable merit in the past, those who have become veterans, and who believe that the laws of the Party and the Soviets are not written for them, but for those fools. This is the kind of person who does not consider it their responsibility to implement the resolutions of the Party and the government, thereby undermining the foundation of Party and state discipline. They dare to violate Party and Soviet laws. What do they expect? They hope that the Soviet regime will not dare to touch them because of their past merits. These arrogant veterans believe that they are irreplaceable and can violate the decisions of leading organs with impunity. What should be done with such personnel? They should be removed from their leading positions without hesitation, regardless of their past merits (Shouts: Right!), they should be transferred, demoted, and this matter should be announced in the newspapers (Shouts: Right!). This is necessary to knock down the arrogant habits of these conceited veteran bureaucrats and settle them in their proper places. This is necessary to consolidate Party and Soviet discipline in our entire work (Shouts: Right! Applause).\n\nNow I will talk about the second type of personnel, I am referring to those who are empty talkers. I can say that these sincere empty talkers (laughter) are sincere and loyal to the Soviet regime; but they lack the ability to lead, lack the ability to organize anything.\n\nHow should we deal with these incorrigible empty talkers? If they are left in action-oriented work, they can sink any lively matter in a flood of endless empty talk. Obviously, they should be removed from leading positions and asked to do other work that is not action-oriented. Empty talkers are not qualified to do action-oriented work (Shouts: Right! Applause). (Stalin: \"Report to the 17th Congress of the CPSU\")\n\nReviewing the work of personnel, reviewing the implementation of work instructions—what does this mean? Reviewing the work of personnel means not reviewing them based on their promises and declarations, but based on the results of their work. Reviewing the implementation of work instructions means not only reviewing them in the office, not only reviewing them according to their formal work reports, but primarily reviewing them in the workplace, based on actual results. Generally speaking, is such a review necessary? It is absolutely necessary. It is necessary first because only by implementing such a review can we thoroughly understand personnel and ascertain their true qualities. It is necessary second because only by implementing such a review can we ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of the implementing organs. It is necessary third because only by implementing such a review can we ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of the work instructions themselves. Some comrades believe that the review of personnel can only be carried out from top to bottom, that is, leaders review their subordinates based on their work. This idea is incorrect. Review from top to bottom is certainly necessary, because it is an effective way to review personnel and review the implementation of work instructions; but in addition to review from top to bottom, there is another review method, namely review from bottom to top, that is, the masses, the subordinates, review the leaders, point out their mistakes, and point out ways to correct these mistakes. This kind of review is one of the most effective ways to review personnel. (Stalin: \"On the Shortcomings of Party Work\")\n\nThe entire work of the Party—especially if the Social Democratic traditions in the Party have not yet been eradicated—must be transformed and built on a new revolutionary pace, so that every step and every action of the Party naturally leads to revolutionizing the masses, to cultivating and educating the broad masses of the working class in the spirit of revolution.\n\nThe Party must not conceal its mistakes, must not be afraid of criticism, but must be good at improving and educating its cadres in its own mistakes.\n\nThe Party must be good at selecting the best elements from among the advanced fighters to the basic leading core, these outstanding elements are extremely loyal, sufficient to become the true expression of the intentions of the revolutionary proletariat, and they are extremely experienced, sufficient to become the true leaders of the proletarian revolution, leaders who are good at using the tactics and strategies of Leninism.\n\nThe Party must constantly improve its social composition, eliminate those opportunists who corrupt the Party, in order to achieve the highest degree of unity.\n\nThe Party must establish iron proletarian discipline, which is based on ideological consistency, clarity of the goals of the movement, unity of practical action, and the conscious attitude of the broad Party masses towards the Party's tasks.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th. A branch reporter commenting on the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's 26th Division stated: Just as Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in the Northeast battlefield were changing commanders for the third time, and bandit chieftain Wei Lihuang had just taken office, our Northeast People's Liberation Army gave him a resounding blow, capturing Xinlitun, a strategic town and railway junction west of Shenyang, and completely annihilating the bandit army's 26th Division. This was indeed a head-on blow to the bandit Wei Lihuang, who was \"trying to restore the advantage in Manchuria\" and \"expressing pessimism.\" This time, our army, with concentrated forces, braved the rare severe cold in Guanwai (the Northeast), and conducted continuous large-scale winter operations. In just two engagements, we annihilated three entire enemy divisions. Bandit chieftain Chen Cheng, who had wildly claimed that he would \"restore the Northeast's advantage in six months,\" was also kicked off the stage as a result. What followed was Wei Lihuang's \"taking command\" and the so-called Fan Hanjie's army being transferred from Shandong to reinforce the defense of the Ji-Re-Liao Corridor. However, all these desperate struggles by the bandits appeared only to expose their inadequacy and embarrassment in the face of the powerful People's Liberation Army. The victory at Xinlitun was a heavy blow to this strategic deployment of the Chen-Wei bandit gang. From then on, not only was a gap opened again in their already severed Liaoxi Corridor, pioneering the road for our army's victorious advance, but also the western gateway to Shenyang was greatly opened, and the satellite strongholds of the enemy's nest in Shenyang were also weakened day by day. It can be seen that in the face of the invincible People's Army, the bandit chiefs and principal culprits who are loyal to Chiang Kai-shek, whether it is Du Yuming, Chen Cheng, or Wei Lihuang, Fan Hanjie, their inevitable fate of failure is undoubtedly doomed, and this truth has once again been confirmed in the victory at Xinlitun.\n\nIn particular, in this battle of Xinlitun, as soon as our army cleared the periphery, the bandit army, which had concentrated a division to defend the key point, abandoned the city and fled in panic. This shows the enemy's fear and demoralization. Compared with the previous Zhangwu campaign and Gongzhuling campaign a month ago, it further shows the dead end of the Northeast bandit army. In the battle of Zhangwu, our army cleared the periphery in two days and resolved the city attack in five hours, completely annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 79th Division that was stubbornly defending the city. In the battle of Gongzhuling, our army annihilated the bandit's 195th and 43rd entire divisions and the New 5th Army headquarters, and blocked the ten enemy divisions coming to the rescue in fifty-four hours of fierce fighting. In this battle of Xinlitun, our army cleared the periphery in one day, and the bandit army abandoned its heavily fortified strongholds and fled in panic. In several hours of street fighting and pursuit, the entire division of bandit troops was completely annihilated. This battle example fully illustrates the situation that the Northeast bandit army is bound to be defeated in every battle today. Whether it \"defends,\" reinforces, or flees, its only fate is complete annihilation. This obvious trend has further increased our infinite confidence and courage in the task of completely eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the Northeast.\n\nAt the same time, the annihilation of the bandit army's 26th Division once again exposed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's conspiracy to send miscellaneous troops to their deaths. Since our army's summer offensive, the two former Northeast Army units that were transferred to the Northeast by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits have been placed in the position of taking the lead in the attack. The 116th Division of the 53rd Army was annihilated at Weiyuanbao, and its 130th Division had one of its regiments annihilated. The main force of the 79th and 105th Divisions of the 49th Army was annihilated in the battle of Yangzhangzi, west of Liaoning, and the designation of the 105th Division was crossed out by Chiang Kai-shek. In the battle of Zhangwu, the 79th Division was annihilated again. With the annihilation of the 26th Division this time, the entire 49th Army, except for a wandering headquarters, was completely finished. What is most vicious is that when the bandit's 26th Division was surrounded this time, the Chen and Wei bandits never sent a single soldier to assist, which was completely different from the situation in which ten divisions were quickly sent to assist when the bandit's 195th and 43rd divisions were annihilated previously. We once again warn those miscellaneous troops who are wielding weapons and selling their lives for Chiang Kai-shek to remember this lesson, lay down their weapons as soon as possible, and return to the people. Do not wait until the People's Liberation Army arrives to repeat the mistakes of the 26th Division.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新华分社记者评新立屯的胜利  打开辽西走廊新缺口开拓了胜利进军道路\n\n1948-02-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    新华分社记者评新立屯的胜利\n    打开辽西走廊新缺口开拓了胜利进军道路\n    【新华社东北三十日电】分社记者评蒋匪二十六师的覆灭称：当东北战场蒋匪三易主帅，匪首卫立煌刚刚到任之时，我东北人民解放军就给他一个下马威，攻克沈（阳）西战略要镇铁路交叉点新立屯，全部歼灭匪军二十六师，这对于“恢复在满洲的优势”“表示悲观”的卫匪立煌，的确是当头一棒。此次我军以集中的兵力，冒关外稀有的奇寒，进行连续大规模的冬季作战，才两个回合，就歼敌三个整师，而狂言“六个月恢复东北优势”的匪首陈诚，也因此被撵下将台。继之而来的就是卫立煌的“登台挂帅”和所谓范汉杰兵团由山东挖肉补疮，前来增援，守卫冀热辽走廊。然而匪徒们这一切垂死挣扎，在强大的人民解放军面前，却只是显得其捉襟见肘，狼狈周章。新立屯战役的胜利，就是给陈、卫匪帮的这一战略部署以沉重一击，从此不仅其已告斩断的辽西走廊又被打开一个缺口，开拓了我军胜利进军的道路，而且沈西门户也大为洞开，敌巢沈阳的卫星据点，也日见削弱。由此可见，在无敌的人民军队面前，替蒋贼效忠卖命的匪首元凶，不管它是杜聿明、陈诚也好、或是卫立煌、范汉杰也好，其必然失败的命运已经注定无疑，这个真理又一次的在新立屯的胜利中得了印证。\n    特别是这次新立屯战斗，我军刚一扫清外围，以一个师集结守卫重点的匪军，就弃城狼狈逃命，这可见敌军胆寒心悸，士气颓丧的情况。如和前次一个月来的彰武战役、公主屯战役相较，更显出东北匪军的穷途末路；彰武之战，我军以两天时间肃清外围，五小时解决攻城战斗，全歼坚守该城的蒋匪七十九师，公主屯之战，我军以五十四小时激战，歼灭出援新民之匪一九五、四十三两个整师和新五军军部，并阻击应援之匪十个师；而这次新立屯战斗，我军在一天之内扫清了外围，匪军即放弃其坚固设防据点，狼狈奔逃，于数小时巷战及捕捉战中，整师匪军就全部覆没。这一战例，充分说明了今日东北匪军每战必败的情况，不管它“坚守”也好，增援也好，逃跑也好，其唯一的命运就只有全部覆没。这个明显的趋势对于我军全部消灭东北境内蒋匪的任务，也就更增加了无限的信心和勇气。\n    同时，这次匪军二十六师的歼灭，又一次暴露了蒋匪帮拿杂牌送死的阴谋手段。自我军夏季攻势后，被蒋匪调来东北的两个旧东北军的部队，一直放在打头阵的地位；五十三军的一一六师在威远堡门被歼灭了，其一三○师则被歼一个团。四十九军的七十九师、一○五师主力在辽西杨仗子一役被歼，一○五师的番号就此被蒋贼一笔勾销，彰武一战七十九师再告歼灭，到这次二十六师的覆灭，整个四十九军除剩下一个流亡的光杆军部外，就此全部完结。而最毒辣的是当此次匪二十六师被围时，陈、卫诸匪始终不派一兵一卒应援，于前此之匪一九五、四三两师被歼时以十个师迅速赴援情形迥然两样。我们再次警告那些手执武器，替蒋贼卖命的杂牌军，记取这一教训，趁早放下武器，归依人民，莫要等到解放军大军降临之时，再蹈二十六师的覆辙。"

One day, the poor peasant group held a meeting to discuss where to set up the democratic village government. Someone suggested the Lianbao office, because everything was readily available there. This proposal was immediately opposed by everyone, who said, \"That was built by the Kuomintang, who would go there?\" At this time, the head of the poor peasant group, Ma Wanjun, suggested, \"Let's go back to the Ge family ancestral hall, the old village Soviet!\" As soon as he finished speaking, everyone said in unison: \"Yes!

Ma Wanjun excitedly said: \"In the past, this was the Fifth Village of the Fifth Township, and the Village Soviet was located here. We fought local tyrants and distributed land, held elections, and made revolution here. Our village was a model in the Fifth Township.

The district committee also expelled him from the Party based on the opinions of the masses. Zhang Baozi from Garden Village in Zanhuang, upon hearing the news of land redistribution, seized the opportunity to sell his property and undermine the Land Law. He found Zhang Jingni, the political director in the village, to act as a mediator (Jingni was not aware of the implications at the time), and sold more than one mu of his paddy field to Qin Wuni for 25,000 yuan, and also sold a cow from his family. Chen Gangxiao, the director of the Home Hermitage Military Committee, announced at a mass meeting that selling things was not allowed, but he sold four sheep the next day. After discussions at the village cadre meeting in the Second District, it was generally believed that such people who deliberately undermined the Land Law must be severely punished. The district government has detained them and is preparing to hand them over to the masses for processing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 破坏土地法自己吃亏  左权赞皇处分坏村干坏分子\n\n1948-02-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    破坏土地法自己吃亏\n    左权赞皇处分坏村干坏分子\n    【太行消息】左权一区与赞皇二区，在最近对个别破坏土地法的村干部及坏分子，分别予以扣押和纪律的处分。左权寒王农会主席在土地法公布后，将开的粉坊停下，一下杀掉六口猪，有的才四十多斤重便杀了，村内农民非常不满。在一区全区贫雇干群会议上，大家讨论，给他撤销工作及开除农会会籍的处分。该区区委会也根据群众意见，将他开除党籍。赞皇花园村张包子，先听到平分土地的消息，便乘机变卖财产，破坏土地法。他找到村内政治主任张净妮当说合人（当时净妮还不明白），把自己一亩多水地，作价二万五千元，卖给了秦五妮，并将他家的一头牛也卖了。即家庵武委会主任陈岗小，在群众会上宣布不许卖东西，他第二天就卖了四个羊。以上几个人经二区村干会讨论，大家认为对这种故意破坏土地法的人，必须严重处分。区政府已把他们扣押起来，准备交群众处理。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Moscow dispatch: While the northern and central parts of the Soviet Union are still in the grip of severe cold, spring has already arrived in the southern Soviet Union. The republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldavia have successively begun large-scale spring plowing campaigns, with millions of hectares of land already sown with wheat and barley. To achieve even greater harvests, collective farmers have reclaimed vast tracts of virgin land, with many previously barren lands producing grain for the first time this year. As of now, the collective farms in southern Ukraine have cultivated over 780,000 hectares more land than in 1940. The slogan \"Complete the Five-Year Plan in Four Years,\" proposed by workers, has been enthusiastically embraced by farmers. Many collective farms have made guarantees and are engaging in mutual challenges and competitions. Ample snowfall throughout the Soviet Union last winter has provided sufficient moisture to the soil, and winter crops across the country are forecasting a bumper harvest. Soviet farmers will receive 2.3 times more agricultural machinery this year than last year. Aerial fertilization and pest control work will also be greatly expanded. Rural electrification achieved significant success last year. According to incomplete statistics, at least 3,100 new rural power stations were built, providing electricity to 5,816 collective farms and 914 machine tractor stations, thus saving 4.5 million workdays. Certain regions, such as the entire rural area of Sverdlovsk Oblast, were completely electrified last year. Electrification will proceed at an even faster pace this year, all of which will guarantee a new bumper harvest this year.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Moscow dispatch: The Central Administration of Civil Aviation of the Soviet Union recently announced a summary of agricultural aviation work for 1947, stating that the total volume of agricultural aviation work last year exceeded that of the previous year by two times, achieving remarkable success in fertilization and pest control. Last year, aircraft were used for the first time to spread fertilizer on winter crops, and the results proved that the harvest in the fertilized areas was greatly increased. Agricultural aircraft also helped 2,000 collective farms in Ukraine to eliminate sugar beet pests by spraying pesticide powder from the air, completely saving the region's sugar beets from destruction. In addition, aircraft were also used to spray powder to aid cotton harvesting. The leaves of cotton sprayed with the powder fell off completely ahead of schedule, and the cotton bolls also cracked open earlier, making machine cotton picking possible and increasing the rate of manual cotton picking by 18 to 20 percent. (According to reports, the Soviet Union used cotton picking machines for the first time last year, with an efficiency equivalent to 40 manual laborers, surpassing American-made cotton picking machines.) The application of agricultural aviation in these areas will be greatly expanded this year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联南部九个共和国  开始大规模春耕  广泛用飞机撒肥除虫\n\n1948-02-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏联南部九个共和国\n    开始大规模春耕\n    广泛用飞机撒肥除虫\n    【新华社陕北二十九日电】莫斯科讯：当苏联北部与中部尚在苦寒之时，在苏联南部，春天却已经到来。土耳克曼、乌兹别克、塔吉克、卡萨克斯坦、乌克兰、阿塞拜疆、亚美尼亚、乔治亚、摩尔达维亚诸共和国，已先后开始了大规模的春耕运动，数百万公顷的土地已播种了小麦与大麦。集体农民为求得更多收获，已开垦了大量处女地，许多过去的荒地上，今年将首次生产粮食。乌克兰南部集体农场，截至目前止，耕地已超过一九四○年耕地七十八万公顷，由工人提出的“四年完成五年计划”的口号，已获得农民的热烈响应。许多集体农场已提出保证，并互相挑战，展开竞赛。去冬全苏降雪充足，土壤获得了足够水分，各地冬季作物已预告丰收。全苏农民今年将获得比去年多二点三倍的农业机器。而航空撒肥及除虫工作等也将大加展开。农村电气化，在去年获得重大成就，据不完全统计，新建农村电力站至少三千一百所，可供应五千八百十六个集体农场与九百十四个机器拖拉机站以电力，因而节省了四百五十万个工作日。若干地区如斯维特洛夫斯克州的全部农村，去年已完全电气化。今年电气化将以更高速度前进，这一切将保证今年新的丰收。\n    【新华社陕北二十九日电】莫斯科讯：苏联民用航空中央管理局，顷公布一九四七年农业航空工作总结称：去年农航工作总量超过前年两倍，在撒肥、除虫方面，已获卓越成就。去年首次对冬季作物试用飞机播撒肥料，结果证明施肥地区收获大为提高。农业飞机又帮助乌克兰二千集体农场清除甜菜根害虫而在上空撒下药粉，完全挽救了该区甜菜免于毁灭。此外，飞机还被用来撒布药粉，帮助棉花摘收，为药粉撒到的棉花，叶子就先期脱落净尽，棉桃亦提前裂开，因而使机器摘棉成为可能，并使人工摘棉速率提高百分之十八至二十。（按去年苏联首次使用摘棉机，其效率等于四十个人工，超过美国制摘棉机。）今年农业航空在这些方面的应用将大力扩展。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Reports from various sources: Under the orders of its American master, the British Labour government is currently \"acting as a firefighter to rescue the 'Marshall Plan'\" (Pravda), actively engaged in the conspiracy to organize a \"Western European bloc.\" It is reported that Britain and France are initiating the organization of a \"Western European bloc\" through negotiations with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, turning it into a part of the \"Marshall Plan.\" Simultaneously, Bevin, in the foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons on the 22nd, made an even more blunt speech, declaring: \"The time has come to strengthen Western Europe\"; and revealing that British diplomatic envoys to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have been instructed to jointly propose to the three countries, along with the French envoys, the signing of an alliance treaty, attempting to make this treaty \"an important core of Western Europe.\" Bevin, as usual, launched a massive attack on the Soviet Union, while flattering his American master to the extreme, saying: \"I believe we should express admiration for the great heart of the American people, which is fully demonstrated in the European Recovery Program.\" It is understood that Bevin's speech was entirely instructed by U.S. imperialism. According to a French Press Agency report on the 23rd, shortly before Bevin delivered his speech, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett and British Ambassador to the U.S. Inverchapel met with Truman; and as soon as Bevin's speech was delivered, the U.S. State Department echoed it on the 23rd, saying: \"The United States wholeheartedly approves of Bevin's proposal to consolidate Western Europe.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Comprehensive reports from various sources: The British imperialist conspiracy to organize a \"Western European bloc,\" and Bevin's speech in the House of Commons, have angered world progressive public opinion. The Soviet Pravda published an article on the 25th, strongly denouncing Bevin's speech as \"a dangerous plan to split Europe against the will of the people, instigated by Wall Street.\" Pravda's diplomatic observer, Isakov, revealed that the \"Western European bloc\" plan is a condition of the \"Marshall Plan,\" with the United States attempting to use it to more easily rule Western Europe and include it in the U.S. network of military bases. However, Isakov stressed: \"This plan is doomed to failure because it contradicts the vital interests of European countries.\" The Czechoslovak Communist Party's newspaper stated on the 26th: \"Bevin's plan to organize Western European countries into a political and military bloc is an idea of the United States, and his speech is proof of a broad and prepared offensive by reactionary forces against world peace.\" The Italian newspaper Unità denounced Bevin as \"a gendarme of U.S. imperialism in Europe,\" pointing out: \"Bevin's 'Western European bloc' is an instrument of war, a threat to peaceful nations and democracy, and an intimidation and blackmail of Europe.\" The newspaper emphasized: \"The Italian Communist Party will do everything to oppose any attempt to drag Italy into this mad gamble.\" The French newspaper Franc-Tireur, in analyzing the servile nature of the Western European bloc, pointed out: \"This bloc has succumbed to the United States to an alarming degree.\" The Indonesian newspaper Pembebasan condemned: \"We do not support Bevin's imperialist plan, and we will fight for freedom. Bevin and his friends will extract as much as possible from Indonesia, Burma, India, and Vietnam, but the people of these countries fighting for freedom will vigorously resist these aggressive plans.\" The Argentine newspaper \"La Labor\" in an editorial entitled \"Attlee is Truman's Lackey,\" fiercely criticized \"Attlee and Bevin's government for maintaining American policy, indicating that the British government has become a lackey of American imperialism.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Comprehensive report: The arrogant speech of Bevin, the U.S. running dog, conspiring to organize a \"Western European bloc,\" continues to arouse unanimous condemnation from world progressive public opinion. The Yugoslav newspaper Borba published an article on the 27th, believing that \"Bevin's speech is an attempt by the British right-wing Socialist Party to assist its master in organizing a bloc of countries under U.S. control to oppose democratic forces and enslave Western European countries, in exchange for some small rewards.\" The newspaper stressed: \"Bevin's talk of organizing a 'Western European bloc' is clear evidence that the reactionaries fear the expansion of the democratic anti-imperialist camp.\" The newspaper concluded: \"Democratic forces will not allow their countries to become colonies of Wall Street.\" Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Director Grosz issued a statement on the 26th, strongly denouncing \"Bevin's speech as completely identical to Churchill's speech.\" He pointed out: \"The 'Western European bloc' advocated by Bevin is not conducive to the cause of peace in Europe, nor is it conducive to the development and independence of Europe.\" Grosz continued: \"We firmly reject all covert decisions related to Poland in the Marshall Plan.\" And said with confidence: \"It is certain that progressive forces will be able to resist all attempts to rebuild Munich in Europe.\" The Czech newspaper \"Rudé Právo\" revealed that \"Bevin's plan was prepared in the United States and agreed to by the United States.\" The Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" said: \"Bevin's plan intends to strengthen Britain's position in Muslim countries, and the British-Iranian treaty is another step in this direction.\" The Indian newspaper \"Statesman\" angrily criticized that \"the foreign policy implemented by Attlee and Bevin is completely consistent with the war-monger Churchill.\" Egyptian newspapers also unanimously opposed Bevin's speech on the 26th. Al Misri reported: \"Bevin's speech revealed Britain's desire to establish a 'Western bloc' and organize so-called 'Near East regional defense' to enslave the people of the Near East.\" The newspaper emphasized: \"The people of the Near East are fighting to defend complete freedom and independence, and there is already a very strong anti-British sentiment among them.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Baghdad dispatch: Due to strong opposition from the Iraqi people, Iraqi Regent Ira formally announced on the 21st that the twenty-year British-Iraqi alliance treaty signed by Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr and British Foreign Secretary Bevin in Portsmouth on the 15th was invalid. As early as the 6th of this month, all students in Baghdad held grand demonstrations and marches, shouting to abolish the traitorous treaty and demanding the dissolution of Parliament and new elections. Although repeatedly suppressed by the police, resulting in deaths and injuries and hundreds of people being arrested, they persisted in their struggle and gained increasing support from the people. Fearing the power of the people, Ira had no choice but to convene an emergency cabinet meeting and issue the above statement. This treaty was originally a continuation of the British-Iraqi alliance treaty signed in 1930 during the British mandate period. The Iraqi people have struggled arduously for more than ten years to abolish the old treaty, but the new treaty is almost exactly the same as the old one. Britain is still allowed to station troops in Iraq and continues to maintain absolute control over Iraqi troops, police, and even civil aviation through the newly established so-called \"Joint Defense Board.\" Britain's privileges over Iraq's largest resource, the Mosul oil field, are also completely unharmed, thus arousing extreme anger among the Iraqi people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英奉美帝命令开始组织“西欧集团”  世界进步舆论同声怒斥\n\n1948-02-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    英奉美帝命令开始组织“西欧集团”\n    世界进步舆论同声怒斥\n    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方讯：奉美国主人之命，英工党政府目前“充当了抢救‘马歇尔计划’的救火队”（真理报），积极从事组织“西欧集团”的阴谋活动。据传：英法正通过和比利时、荷兰、卢森堡三国的谈判，开始组织“西欧集团”，把它变成“马歇尔计划”之一部分。与此同时，贝文二十二日在英下院外交政策辩论中，更发表了直言不讳的演说，他宣称：“加强西欧的时间已经到来”；并泄露：英驻比、荷、卢三国外交使节，已奉命与法国使节一致发出和比、荷、卢三国谈判签订同盟条约的建议，并妄图使这一条约“成为西欧之重要核心”。贝文照例对苏联大肆攻击，对其美国主子则极尽其谄媚称：“我认为目前应向欧洲复原计划中充分表现出来的美国人民之伟大心肠，表示崇敬。”据悉，贝文之演说完全为美帝国主义所授意。据法新社二十三日电透露：在贝文发表演说前不久，美副国务卿罗维特和英驻美大使殷维却波尔，曾与杜鲁门会谈；而贝文演说刚才发表，美国务院二十三日即与其合唱称：“美国衷心赞成贝文巩固西欧的建议”。\n    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合各方讯：英帝国主义组织“西欧集团”之阴谋活动，和贝文的下院演说，使世界进步舆论发怒。苏联真理报廿五日撰文力斥贝文演说“为违反民意企图分裂欧洲之危险计划，乃华尔街所授意。”真理报外交观察家伊萨科夫揭发称：“西欧集团”计划，是作为“马歇尔计划”的条件之一，美国企图借此更容易地统治西欧，并把它列入美国的作战基地网中。但伊氏力称：“这个计划由于它与欧洲国家的切身利益相矛盾，因此它注定了要失败的。”捷共机关报于二十六日指出：“贝文组织西欧各国成立政治军事集团的计划，是美国出的主意，他的演说是反动势力对世界和平进行广泛和有准备之攻势的证明。”意大利团结报怒斥贝文“为美帝国主义在欧洲的宪兵”，指出：“贝文的‘西欧集团’乃是战争的工具，是对和平民族及民主的威胁，对欧洲的恫吓讹诈。”该报强调：“贝文的立足点是不稳的，因为他威胁千百万人民的生命与欧洲的将来。”该报力称：“意共将全力反对使意大利卷入这一疯狂赌博的任何企图。”法国义勇军报在分析西欧集团的奴隶性时指出：“这个集团对美国已屈服到可惊的程度。”印尼解放报谴责称：“我们不支持贝文的帝国主义计划，我们将为争取自由而斗争。贝文及其友人们将尽可能向印尼、缅甸、印度与越南多索取东西，但这些国家为争取自由而战的人民，将给这些侵略计划以有力的反抗。”阿根廷“劳工报”在题为“艾德礼是杜鲁门的马弁”的社论中，猛烈抨击“艾德礼、贝文政府维护美国之政策，说明英国政府已变成美国帝国主义的马弁”。\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合报导：美国走卒贝文阴谋组织“西欧集团”的狂妄演说，继续激起世界进步舆论的一致抨斥。南斯拉夫战斗报廿七日撰文，认为“贝文演说，是英国右翼社会党力图援助其主子，组织在美国控制下的国家集团，以反对民主势力与奴役西欧各国，借此换取一些小的报酬。”该报力称：贝文所说的组织“西欧集团”，“这就是反动派害怕民主反帝阵营扩大的明证”。该报结语力称：“民主势力将不容许他们的国家变成华尔街的殖民地”。波兰外交部新闻司长格罗兹二十六日发表声明，力斥“贝文演说和邱吉尔的演说完全相同”。他指出：“贝文所提倡的‘西欧集团’，不利于欧洲的和平事业，也不利于欧洲的发展与独立。”格氏继称：“我们坚决拒斥马歇尔计划中对波兰有关的一切暗中的决定”。并满怀信心说：“可以肯定进步势力将能抵抗一切重建慕尼黑欧洲的企图”。捷克“鲁德·布拉窝”报揭发“贝文的计划是在美国准备而且由美国同意的”。巴基斯坦“顿报”说：“贝文计划是打算加强英国在回教国家的地位，英伊条约正是朝着这个方向走的另一步骤。”印度“政治家”报怒责“艾德礼与贝文所执行的外交政策，是与战争贩子邱吉尔完全一致。”埃及各报二十六日也一致反对贝文演说，阿尔米斯里报称：“贝文演说透露了英国企图建立‘西方集团’，并组织所谓‘近东区域防御’的欲望，以奴役近东人民。”该报强调指出：“近东人民正为保卫完全的自由独立而斗争，他们之间已存在着极强烈的反英情绪”。\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】巴格达讯：由于伊拉克人民强烈反对结果，伊拉克摄政王伊拉，于二十一日正式宣布伊总理雅布尔与英外相贝文十五日在朴资茅斯签订之英伊二十年同盟条约无效。早自本月六日起，巴格达全体学生即连续举行盛大示威游行，高呼取消卖国条约，并要求解散国会，重行大选。虽屡遭警察弹压，死伤多人，数百人并横遭拘捕，但仍坚持斗争，并获得日益广泛之人民支持。伊拉慑于人民威力，乃不得不召集内阁紧急会议后发表上述声明。按此约原为一九三○年英国委任统治期内所订英伊同盟条约之继续，伊拉克人民十余年来为废除旧约而艰苦斗争，然新约竟与旧约几乎完全相同，英国仍得驻军伊拉克，并得通过新设之所谓“联防局”而继续保有对伊拉克军队、警察甚至民用航空之绝对控制权，英国对伊拉克最大资源摩苏尔油田之特权，亦丝毫无损，因此激起伊人之极度愤慨。"

    "content": "Middle Peasants, Don't Put on Airs\n    Zhao Shuli\n    Item B of Article 4 of the Supplementary Measures to the Land Law promulgated by the Border Region Government stipulates:\n    The land of well-to-do middle peasants may be appropriately drawn out under the principle of drawing more to compensate for less and drawing from fertile land to compensate for barren land, but their movable property and houses shall not be touched.\n    It is clearly written above that the movable property and houses of middle peasants should not be touched, but some well-to-do middle peasants, or even middle peasants who cannot be called well-to-do, have been cutting down trees, selling livestock, and eating and drinking extravagantly since hearing that the Land Law was promulgated, as if this time it will fall on their heads.\n    If landlords and rich peasants do this, there is a reason for it, that is, they do not want to hand it over to the peasant association; the villagers also have a way to deal with him, because he has destroyed the fruits that the masses should have obtained and can be sent to the people's court to be convicted. Why do middle peasants do this? Maybe they heard some rumors from landlords and rich peasants, or maybe they are worrying blindly because they don't understand official affairs. What can the villagers do about these things in the future? If you say he is destroying the fruits of the masses, these things are his own, and the law stipulates that his movable property should not be touched, so naturally it should not belong to the masses; if you say he is not guilty, the middle peasants in the village who do not understand official affairs have also wasted many things following him, making people feel uneasy, and it is hard to say that he is really not guilty.\n    I think these middle peasants are making a very bad bargain: the property consumed is their own, so naturally they suffer. After the land reform, other middle peasants go to plow the land, and you sell the donkey and watch others plow; the pigs of other middle peasants grow fat, and you kill the piglets early and watch others eat meat and sell money; the trees of other middle peasants grow tall, and your saplings are made into carrying poles early, watching others make beams and pillars... Seeing other middle peasants join the peasant association, you go to sign up, and people think you are stubborn and don't want you. These are still small things, if you lead with a stubborn head, many middle peasants will be fooled by you, and if people who have been fooled pursue this matter in the future, it will be even more troublesome. That's called \"wasting things and not pleasing anyone,\" suffering on both ends.\n    These middle peasant friends who are looking for trouble, don't do that again, don't go putting on airs. The policy is to closely unite all middle peasants. As long as you are indeed a middle peasant, whether rich or not, in this equal distribution of land, not a bit of your movable property will be touched. The Land Law has already provided you with a guarantee.\n  (Reprinted from New Masses)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中农不要外气\n赵树理\n1948-02-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中农不要外气\n    赵树理\n    边府公布的实行土地法补充办法第四条乙项，有这样规定：\n    富裕中农的土地，得在抽多补少抽肥补瘦的原则下酌予抽出，但不得动其浮财及房屋。\n    这上边明明白白写着不动中农的浮财和房子，可是有些富裕中农，或者连富裕也说不上的中农，听说土地法公布出来以后，就砍树木，卖牲口，大吃大喝，好象这一次就要弄到他头上一样。\n    要是地主富农这样做，有他的原因，就是不想缴给农会；全村农民对他也有办法，因为他破坏了群众应得的果实，可以送人民法庭判罪。中农这样做是为什么呢？也许是听了地主富农的什么谣言，也许是自己摸不着公事瞎操心。将来全村农民对这些事有什么办法呢？说他是破坏群众果实吧，这些东西又是他自己的，法令上规定不准动他的浮财，自然不应归群众；说他没有罪吧，村里摸不着公事的中农跟着他也浪费了许多东西，弄得人心不安，也难说真正没罪。\n    我觉着这些中农做得太不上算了：消耗的财产是自己的，自然是自己吃亏。土地改革过后，别的中农都去犁地，你把驴卖了，看人家犁；别的中农的猪长肥了，你早把小猪杀了，看人家吃肉、卖钱；别的中农的树长大了，你的小树早做了抬杆，看人家做梁做柱………看见人家别的中农入农会，你去报名，人家嫌你顽固，不要你。这些都还是小事，要是你带了个顽固头，好多中农跟着你上了当，以后人家上当的人追究起这事来，更加麻烦。那就叫“费了东西不讨好”，两头吃苦。\n    这些自找苦吃的中农朋友，再不要那样做，自己找外气了。政策上是紧紧的团结全体中农，只要你确实是中农，不论富裕不富裕，在这次平分土地中间，不会动你一点浮财的，土地法上已经给你立了保状。 \n  （转载新大众）"

For example, Li Yuanqing (former middle peasant) of Shuzhang Village said: \"How many landlords and rich peasants are there? There are more poor people. In the past, the landlords ignored us, but now the poor and hired peasants help us with everything. Before the Land Law came out, I thought that once the rich were gone, it would be our turn, the middle peasants, to be struggled against. Now that the Land Law is promulgated, I feel much more at ease.\" Li Nianyang said: \"Last year, I herded four or five livestock (belonging to the collective) and farmed fifteen mu of land. I am neither rich nor poor. Every day I sell coal and deliver goods. I am always with you poor folks. Middle peasants and poor peasants can talk to each other, and each has the other in mind. We are all suffering people.\" Suo Hai said: \"That bunch (landlords and rich peasants) can't see us, and we don't like the sight of them either.\" Then Feng Xiaonian said: \"Finding poor people can help us, what would a landlord do for us? If we rely on the poor and hired peasants, we can do anything. We are all in this together. Landlords rely on money to eat, we rely on strength. Middle and poor peasants are closer, middle and poor peasants are more like family. We dare not speak loudly in the homes of landlords, but we are full of energy in the homes of laborers (hired workers)!\" Yuanqing added: \"In the past, if we were to team up, it would be we middle and poor peasants teaming up. We wouldn't team up with the landlords. Now that mutual aid is popular, it is still us middle and poor peasants working together.\" Feng Yuansuo and Zhao Xiqun said: \"Hoeing and herding livestock are all done by us middle and poor peasants. We must be of one mind with the basic masses. My child is in the Eighth Route Army, how could I be of one mind with those landlords and rich peasants!\" Yuansuo said: \"I have suffered at the hands of the landlords in the past and have long wanted to get back at them. If it weren't for the basic masses struggling against them, I would never achieve my goal. In the past, when we worked for the landlords, we always spoke to the old farmhands!

Peasants in a certain village once brought one million Kuomintang currency, four fat pigs, and many peanuts, and beat gongs and drums to express their gratitude to the wounded and sick of the People's Liberation Army. In two villages in a certain county, with the help of the work team, the armed forces of the landlords were disarmed, and the masses spoke out about their grievances and vented their anger. The masses immediately formed a guerrilla force, and after the troops moved, they persisted in the struggle and repelled the counter-attack of the landlord armed forces. A guerrilla force in a certain village grew from a dozen people to more than two hundred in a few days. Under the slogan of \"Poor people want to turn themselves around, join the People's Liberation Army,\" some villages enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army. In a certain village, ten emancipated peasants voluntarily signed up to join the army in four days.

At the joint peasant representative conference in the first district of Guoxian and Chengguan, hundreds of young peasants immediately signed up to join the army. Yuan Mantang, a young peasant from Sanji Village, and his brother eagerly signed up. Gao Rencheng, a peasant from Xitian Village, Daixian County, whose eldest son was honorably wounded and returned home in the patriotic self-defense war, now voluntarily sent his second son to join the army. Meng Wenxiu, a peasant from Xingaocun village, made meat dumplings for his son and said goodbye: \"My family has been poor for three generations, and now we have finally turned ourselves around. Work hard and protect our good life.\" At the farewell meeting, the young new soldiers wore red cloth strips with the words \"Peasant Soldiers\" on their chests, and swore in unison to the fathers and brothers who were seeing them off, \"We will not return home until we have defeated Yan Xishan.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保卫自己翻身的好日子  豫陕鄂农民争相参军\n\n1948-02-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    保卫自己翻身的好日子\n    豫陕鄂农民争相参军\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线三十一日电】七分区群众运动中翻身农民爱护解放军伤员，并争相参加游击队与正规军。某村农民曾经带了一百万蒋币、四口肥猪和很多落花生等，打着锣鼓去慰劳解放军伤病员。某县两个村庄，在解放军驻防时，经过工作队的帮助，解除了地主武装，并诉了苦、出了气，群众当即成立游击队，在部队移防之后，坚持斗争，打退了地主武装的反攻。某村游击队在几天内就由十几个人发展到二百多人。有的村子在“穷人要翻身，参加解放军”的口号下，踊跃参加解放军。某村在四天内有十个翻身农民自动报名参军，某团在泌阳地区活动的半个月中，就有八十九名青年农民自动加入。\n    【新华社晋绥三十日电】晋北崞县、代县翻身农民为防止阎匪骚扰，半月内自动建立起拥有数百青年农民的精悍游击队，开赴接敌区，练兵习武，保卫土地与胜利果实。崞县一区及城关联合农民代表大会上，当即有数百名青年农民报名参军，三吉村青年农民元满堂弟兄二人争相报名。代县西田村农民高任成的长子在爱国自卫战争中光荣负伤回家，现在他自动又送次子参军。新高村农民孟文秀包了肉饺子给他儿子饯行说：“我家受了三辈子穷，现在才翻了身，你好好干吧，保护咱们的好日子”。欢送会上青年新战士胸前佩着农民子弟兵的红布条，向欢送父老兄弟们齐声宣誓“不打倒阎锡山不回家”。"

    "content": "【News from our paper】Zhang Wanqing and Liang Madou, two cadres from the Fifth District of Lucheng, went to Licun Gou to publicize the Land Law Outline. Instead of using the method of cadres gathering people, they directly visited poor farmers. On the evening of the 23rd, they had a discussion with more than ten poor and hired peasants, including Chen Liansheng and Shen Lisheng. Zhang Wanqing read the Land Law two or three times and gave a detailed explanation. The poor and hired peasants were very excited to know that they could rise up to be masters of their own affairs and completely turn themselves around. They poured out their heartfelt words, one after another. The various situations of the incomplete land reform in Licun Gou were largely clarified.\n    Village Cadres Shelter Landlords, Many Were Not Struggled Against\n    There were nine big landlord families in the whole village, but only four were struggled against. The remaining five were not struggled against because they were all relatives of the village cadres. Village Chief Yang Fazhe and Armed Committee Director Han Yuzhong openly said to the masses: \"These five families became rich through labor, it is right to ask them to voluntarily take out some things.\" As a result, they were all sheltered. Landlord Yang Guicheng (the village chief's relative) only calculated forty dan of coarse grain, but he was unwilling to give it. He ran to the Taiyue District and lived there for more than ten days. He took a hand grenade back and pretended to have joined the Eighth Route Army, threatening the masses everywhere. The village chief said: \"He has already joined the Eighth Route Army, exempt him from ten dan!\" In the end, he only gave thirty dan of coarse grain, and that was the end of it.\n    Landlord Yang Gejiao cultivated fifty mu of land, had forty-five rooms, fed two head of livestock, and also ran a grocery store and a vinegar workshop, eating meat and noodles every day, and often lending grain and money. During the struggle, he \"voluntarily\" gave thirty dan of coarse grain, and everything else was untouched. He even got into the Farmers' Association and became a village cadre and militiaman, continuing to oppress the masses. Yang Fushun's family of five cultivated one hundred and ten mu of land, had twenty-nine rooms in a two-story building, raised a flock of sheep, fed three head of livestock, and hired four long-term laborers, lending grain and money. Now he still has two head of livestock, one cart, forty mu of land, and eight rooms, and the sheep have not been touched at all. He is still living a good life. Li Shunzhi's family of seven cultivated one hundred and fifty mu of land, fed two head of livestock, had thirty-four rooms in a two-story building, and hired two people. He \"voluntarily\" gave eighty dan of coarse grain, seventy-two mu of bad land, twenty-five yuan in silver, and two pieces of clothing, and that was the end of it. Now he still has thirty-four rooms in a two-story building, one head of livestock, one cart, and seventy-eight mu of good land. All the interior goods were untouched, and life is still very good. Shen Xinyou cultivated one hundred and twenty mu of land, fed three head of livestock, and had thirty-one rooms in a two-story building. He \"voluntarily\" gave one head of livestock, ten mu of bad land, and ten dan of coarse grain. Now he still has one hundred mu of good land, two head of livestock, three carts, and thirty-one rooms. The interior goods were untouched, and he even hired a long-term laborer and shared the fruits of labor. Yang Guicheng cultivated one hundred and twenty mu of land, had twenty-six rooms in a two-story building, fed two head of livestock, and lent grain and money. He \"voluntarily\" gave one head of livestock, one cart, and thirty dan of coarse grain, and everything else was untouched.\n\n    The above five families had a total of one hundred and thirty-seven rooms in two-story buildings, three hundred and fifty-eight mu of good land, eight head of livestock, nine carts, and a flock of sheep. Under the protection of the village cadres, some were classified as middle peasants, and some got into the Farmers' Association and became village cadres and militiamen, continuing to ride on the heads of the masses, acting like overlords.\n\n    Village Cadres, After Hearing the Land Law, Still Want to Cover Up\n\n    After landlord Yang Guicheng got into the militia, he colluded with the director of the Armed Committee and the public security officer, and sneaked into the homes of poor peasants Jia Fubao and Shen Lisheng in the middle of the night, dragged them outside the village, pretended to be Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and scared them. They also beat Shen Lisheng. The destitute Shen Xicun's family of two was allocated three rooms, eight mu of land, one hundred jin of corn, and two pieces of clothing during the land reform. But they had no latrine, so they couldn't put manure on the land, and they had no livestock or cart, so they were worried all day long. Poor peasant Tiansheng was allocated four shi of rice in the struggle. He couldn't bear to eat it every day, and wanted to save it up to buy livestock. Landlord Han Huaicheng deceived him into buying it together, and bought a horse. Han Huaicheng had carts and furniture, and never lent them to Tiansheng. Tiansheng bought livestock but couldn't use it, and was so angry that he went deaf in one ear. The son of destitute Shen Manxi joined the army, and he still lived in the temple. Later, he was allocated three rooms. In addition, there were five families with too few carts and no livestock, so they could not produce. There were also eight families who did not have enough food to eat. Poor peasant Yang Guosheng could only eat until the first month of the year.\n\n    After the Land Law Outline was announced, the village chief and the director of the Armed Committee went to the district for a meeting. They didn't say a word when they came back, but first found the landlords Li Shunzhi, Shen Xiaofa, Han Gejiao, and Yang Fuming, and said to them: \"The poor masses in our village have not turned themselves around. You quickly take out houses, land, and livestock to give to the masses, so that we will have something to say when the superiors come to investigate!\" They also told them not to be pessimistic. The poor peasants all said: \"Only when we are masters of our own affairs can we do a good job of implementing the Land Law!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 区干部深入宣传土地法  李村沟农民说知心话\n\n1948-02-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    区干部深入宣传土地法\n    李村沟农民说知心话\n    【本报消息】潞城五区区干部张万庆与梁马斗两同志到李村沟宣传土地法大纲，不用由干部召集人的办法，直接深入访问贫苦农民。又在二十三号晚上，和陈连生、申礼盛等十多个贫雇一起座谈，张万庆把土地法念了两三遍，并且作了详细解释。贫雇知道自己能起来当家，彻底翻身，都非常兴奋。把心坎里的话，你一句，我两嘴的都扯出来。李村沟土地改革不彻底的各种情形，大体上都弄清楚了。\n    村干包庇地主，好多就没有斗。\n    全村大地主有九户，只斗了四户，其余五户没有斗，因为都是村干部的本家和亲戚。村长杨发则和武委会主任韩玉忠公开对群众说：“这五户是劳动发家，叫他们自动拿出些东西就对了。”结果都包庇下来了。地主杨贵成（村长本家）只算了四十石粗粮，他还不肯出。跑到太岳区住了十多天，拿了一颗手榴弹回来，冒充参加了八路军，到处威胁群众。村长说：“他已经参加了八路军，免了他十石吧！”最后只出了三十石粗粮就算完事。\n    地主杨圪角种五十亩地，房四十五间，喂两头牲口，还开着杂货铺、醋坊，每天吃肉吃面，经常放谷放帐。斗争时“自动”了三十石粗粮，其他一切未动。还钻进农会当了村干部、民兵，照旧欺压群众。杨福顺五口人，种一百一十亩地，房楼二十九间，养一群羊，喂三个牲口，雇四个长工，放谷放帐。现在还有牲口两个，大车一辆，地四十亩，房八间，羊根本没动，过的还是好生活。李顺只七口人，种一百五十亩地，喂两个牲口，楼房三十四间，雇两个人，“自动”出八十石粗粮，七十二亩坏地，现洋二十五元，衣服两件，牲口一个，就没了事。现在还有楼房三十四间，牲口一个，大车一辆，好地七十八亩，内货全部未动，生活仍然很好。申辛有种一百二十亩地，喂三个牲口，楼房三十一间，“自动”出牲口一个，坏地十亩，粗粮十石；现在还有好地一百亩，牲口两个，大车三辆，房三十一间。内货没动，还雇着一个长工，而且还分了果实。杨贵成种一百二十亩地，楼房二十六间，牲口两个，放谷放帐，“自动”出牲口一个，大车一辆，粗粮三十石，其他一概没动。\n    以上五户，共有楼房一百三十七间，好地三百五十八亩，牲口八个，大车九辆，羊一群。在村干部包庇下，有的划成份划成中农，有的钻进了农会，当了村干部、民兵，继续骑在群众头上，作威作福。\n    村干听了土地法，还想打掩护。\n    地主杨贵成钻进民兵后，勾结武委会主任及公安员等，半夜三更黑洞洞的跳到贫雇贾付保和申礼盛家里，把他们拉到村外，冒充日本人和蒋匪，吓唬他们。并把申礼盛打了一顿。赤贫申喜存两口人，翻身中分了三间房，八亩地，一百斤玉茭，两件衣服。但是没有茅房，粪不能上地，更没有牲口、大车，仍然整天发愁。贫雇天盛在斗争中分了四石米，每天舍不得吃，想积起来买个牲口，地主韩怀成诳骗他合伙买，买了匹马。韩怀成有大车、有家具，从不借给天盛，天盛买了牲口用不上，干瞪眼，把耳朵都气聋了。赤贫申满喜的儿子参军了，自己还住在庙里，后来才分给他三间房。另外有五户少车没牲口，没法生产。还有八户粮食不够吃，贫雇杨过盛只能吃到正月。\n    土地法大纲公布后，村长、武委会主任到区上开会，回来没有吭气，却先找了李顺只、申小发、韩圪角、杨福明这几户地主，对他们说：“咱村穷苦群众没有翻了身，你们赶快拿出房屋、土地、牲口给群众，上级来查，我们就有说的啦！”并叫他们不要悲观。贫雇都说：“一定要咱们自己来当家作主，才能把土地法办好！”"

However, according to recent understanding, in many areas, landlords and rich peasants dare to disregard government laws and regulations and carry out various conspiracies and sabotage, such as transferring, dispersing, secretly selling, and damaging property and grain, slaughtering livestock, spreading rumors, provoking disunity among peasants, feigning diligence to deceive the masses, and even colluding with bad village cadres to create false struggles, and launching counter-attacks and sabotage against peasants and cadres. If strict measures are not taken immediately against such insidious and criminal means, it will inevitably cause very serious consequences. The notice stipulates: (1) Any landlord or rich peasant who launches a counter-attack, directly killing or sabotaging emancipated peasants and village cadres, should be immediately arrested, a people's court should be organized for public trial, and they should be suppressed. (2) Any landlord or rich peasant who colludes with bad village cadres to carry out false struggles, or kills emancipated peasants in the name of the masses, or confiscates their property, in addition to immediately arresting the landlords and rich peasant elements and bringing them to justice, the masses who are coerced should be educated through exposing the conspiracy of the landlords and rich peasants. (3) Any landlord or rich peasant who engages in destructive acts such as transferring, concealing, dispersing, selling, or damaging property, or slaughtering livestock, should be arrested and punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing sabotage of land reform promulgated by the border government. All public and private shops and cooperatives shall also not privately purchase any items from landlords and rich peasants; those who violate this will also be punished. (4) Landlord and rich peasant elements who create rumors and provoke disunity among peasants must also be thoroughly traced and arrested for legal action. (5) Agricultural associations and peasant masses in all regions and villages, especially hired and poor peasants, should consciously and voluntarily monitor all destructive acts of landlords and rich peasants. If discovered, they should be immediately stopped and reported to the local government. (6) Counties and districts should earnestly educate village cadres who have taken too many fruits, and return the excess fruits in full during the equitable distribution, handing them over to the masses for equitable distribution, and they must not be dispersed and destroyed. Otherwise, in addition to returning them in full in the future, they will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. At the same time, according to the section on middle peasant policy in Chairman Mao's report on the current situation and tasks, an explanation should be given to the middle peasants, stating that for the few well-to-do middle peasants who have a small amount of surplus land, only their small amount of surplus land will be moved during the equitable distribution, and their floating wealth, grain, and livestock will not be touched. This will reassure the middle peasants to concentrate on production and expose the rumors and provocative conspiracies of the landlords and rich peasants. After receiving this notice, governments at all levels should immediately publicize and explain it to cadres and the masses, and prevent the destructive acts of landlords and rich peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳行署发出通告  严禁地主破坏土地法  劝告中农勿信谣言安心生产\n\n1948-02-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    太岳行署发出通告\n    严禁地主破坏土地法\n    劝告中农勿信谣言安心生产\n    【太岳消息】太岳行署为了严禁地主富农破坏土地改革，给各级政府各地农民发了一个通告，上面说：自土地法大纲公布以后，本署曾经布告各地，必须贯彻执行，不许地主富农有任何破坏行为。但据最近了解，仍有不少地区，地主富农竟敢不顾政府法令，进行各种阴谋破坏，如转移、分散、偷卖、损坏财产粮食，宰杀牲畜，散布谣言，挑拨农民间团结，假献殷勤迷惑群众，甚至勾结坏的村干部，制造假斗争，对农民及干部进行反攻及暗害等等。似此阴谋罪恶手段，若不立即采取严厉措施，势必造成很大恶果。通告中规定：（一）凡地主富农进行反攻，直接杀害或暗害翻身农民及村干部者，应立即逮捕，组织人民法庭公审，予以镇压。（二）凡地主富农勾结坏的村干部，进行假斗争，或借群众之名而杀害翻身农民，或没收其财产者，除对地主富农分子立即逮捕予以法办外，对胁从的群众，应从揭发地主富农的阴谋中给以教育。（三）凡地主富农有转移、隐蔽、分散、变卖、损坏财产，屠杀牲畜等破坏行为者，应依照边府颁布的破坏土地改革治罪条例，予以逮捕处分。各公私商店合作社亦不得私自收买地主富农任何物品，违者亦给以处分。（四）对制造谣言、挑拨农民间团结的地主富农分子，亦须彻底追根，予以逮捕法办。（五）各地各村农会及农民群众，特别是雇贫农，应自觉自动起来，监视地主富农一切破坏行为。如经发现，应立即予以制止，并向当地政府告发。（六）县区应认真的教育多占果实的村干部，将多占果实在平分中如数退出，交群众平分，决不可分散破坏。否则除将来照数退出外，并按情节轻重予以处分。同时根据毛主席目前形势与任务报告中对中农政策部分，向中农作解释，说明少数富裕中农有少数多余土地者，在平分时只动其少数多余土地，不动浮财粮食牲畜。使中农安心生产，揭破地主富农之造谣挑拨阴谋。各级政府接此通告后，立即向干部群众作宣传解释，并制止地主富农的破坏行为。"

After more than ten days of talks with Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Molotov, Deputy Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mikoyan, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others, the two governments have reached an agreement on major political and economic issues between the two countries and the current international political situation. On the 26th, they signed a trade agreement for the period of 1948 to 1952, and an agreement for the Soviet Union to supply Poland with industrial equipment. The former agreement stipulates that the total value of trade between the two countries will reach more than one billion US dollars in five years. The Soviet Union will supply Poland with: iron, chromium, aluminum, manganese ore, sand, petroleum products, cotton, asbestos, automobiles, and tractors. Poland will supply the Soviet Union with: coal, coking coal, textiles, steel products, sugar, zinc, railway carriages, and cement. The prices of various goods will be determined by both parties in advance each year based on international prices. The latter agreement stipulates that from 1948 to 1956, the Soviet Union will regularly supply Poland with equipment for various new large-scale metallurgical plants, power, chemical, and textile factories, as well as equipment for rebuilding cities and ports. To this end, the Soviet Union will provide Poland with a credit loan of 450 million US dollars. In addition, the Soviet Union has agreed to sell Poland another 200,000 tons of grain on credit, in addition to the 300,000 tons of grain already determined to be shipped to Poland. This grain will be delivered in full within three months. The representatives of the two countries also exchanged views and reached an agreement on the implementation of the technical cooperation agreement signed on April 5th of last year, and on the issue of Poland's compensation to the Soviet Union for German property in Poland in 1948. Stalin hosted a banquet to bid farewell to the Polish delegation after the signing of the agreement on the 26th. The Polish delegation returned to Poland the next day.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Moscow Dispatch: Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz made a speech before leaving the Soviet Union on the 27th, stating: This visit to the Soviet Union has given the governments of our two countries the opportunity to reach a completely unified understanding of the current international situation, and has also enabled us to reach a completely unified understanding of the methods for the economic revival of our countries that have been devastated by war, as well as the path that these countries should follow to develop their economies and maintain their sovereign integrity. These views have been fully embodied in the various economic agreements we have concluded. They are of great historical significance to the economic development of Poland. They also constitute a new link in a series of facts that, as Stalin, the great friend of Poland, said, \"are sufficient to consolidate the friendship between the two countries.\" We fully understand the achievements of this trip, that is, we have taken a major step forward in economic development, strengthening the friendship between the two countries, and safeguarding the security of the two countries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 对目前国际政治形势得到一致认识  苏波签订五年换货协定\n\n1948-02-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    对目前国际政治形势得到一致认识\n    苏波签订五年换货协定\n    【新华社陕北卅一日电】莫斯科讯：波兰总理西伦凯维兹、副总理哥穆尔卡，率领工商业部长明兹等政府代表团一行，于本月十六日抵莫斯科，与苏联部长会议主席斯大林、副主席兼外长莫洛托夫、对外贸易部长米高扬等经十余日会谈后，两国政府已就两国间重大政治经济问题及目前国际政治形势获致协议，并于廿六日签订一九四八年至五二年间换货协定，及苏联供给波兰工业装备之协定。前一协定规定两国在五年间换货总值将达十亿美元以上，苏联将供给波兰：铁、铬、铝、锰矿、砂、石油产品、棉花、石棉、汽车及拖拉机等。波兰将供给苏联：煤、焦煤、纺织品、钢制品、食糖、锌、火车厢及水泥等。至各项货品价格则规定双方按年根据国际价格事先妥为厘定。后一协定规定：苏联自一九四八年至五六年止，经常供应波兰以各种新式大冶金工厂、动力、化学、纺织等工厂之装备及重建城市与港口之装备。苏联为此特贷与波兰四亿五千万美元之信用贷款，此外苏联并同意在前已确定输往波兰之三十万吨谷物外，再另以信用贷款方式售与波兰谷物二十万吨，此项谷物在三个月内即可全部交清。两国代表亦曾就去年四月五日所订技术合作协定之实施情形及波兰对一九四八年德国在波兰财产对苏赔偿问题交换意见，并获得协议。斯大林在廿六日订约后，曾设宴为波兰代表团饯行，波兰代表团已于次日返波。\n    【新华社陕北三十一日电】莫斯科讯：波兰总理西伦凯维兹，于二十七日离苏前发表谈话，略称：此次访苏，使我们两国政府有机会对目前国际形势得到了完全一致的认识，也使我们惨遭战祸蹂躏国家复兴经济的方法，以及对于这些国家发展经济并保持其主权完整所应遵循的道路，得到了完全一致的认识。这些观点，已在我们缔结的诸项经济协定中全部体现。它们对于波兰经济发展具有极大历史意义。它们又构成了如波兰伟大友人斯大林所称：“足以巩固两国友谊的”一系列事实中的新环节。我们充分了解此行成就，即在经济发展、加强两国友谊与保障两国安全方面，已前进了一大步。"

Residents of Damascus, the capital of Syria, held a large protest demonstration on the 27th, shouting slogans such as \"Sever relations with Britain.\" The demonstrators also submitted a memorandum to the Iraqi Minister, protesting against the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and all unequal treaties signed between Britain and Arab countries. The memorandum solemnly demanded \"the true independence of Arab countries.\" Democratic人士 from Outer Jordan, who had fled to Damascus due to persecution by King Abdullah of Outer Jordan, also sent telegrams to Abdullah and Bevin, strongly protesting the conclusion of a new enslavement treaty between Britain and Outer Jordan. Arab newspapers have also fiercely criticized Bevin's arrogant statement after signing the so-called Anglo-Iraqi alliance treaty: \"This treaty will be the beginning of a series of similar treaties concluded between Britain and Arab countries.\" The Lebanese Telegraph stated: \"The Lebanese people have repeatedly stated that they are willing to maintain neutrality towards all countries and maintain friendly relations with them. We hope that our authorities will sacredly abide by neutrality for our independence.\" The Al-Boblack newspaper reminded the people to be vigilant against Bevin's conspiracy and questioned, \"If one party to the treaty speaks on our behalf without consulting us, is it claiming to be our protector?\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 31st: Baghdad dispatch: The anti-British movement of the Iraqi people is rising sharply. Masses in various places have broken through the suppression of the military police and bravely held demonstrations. After a mass demonstration of 100,000 people in Baghdad, Iraqi Regent Ira was forced to announce the resignation of former Prime Minister Jabr on the 27th and appoint former Senate Speaker Sadr to form a new cabinet. Jabr had just returned from Britain after signing the so-called \"Anglo-Iraqi Alliance Treaty\" with Bevin (which has now been declared abolished by the Iraqi side) and has now fled to Amman, the capital of Outer Jordan, to escape punishment.\n\nDuring the Baghdad demonstration, the military police even used machine guns to fire on the demonstrators, resulting in hundreds of casualties, but the people still persisted in their struggle, bravely and unyieldingly. According to TASS Middle East News, the Iraqi people's resistance to the Anglo-Iraqi treaty has greatly frightened Britain, which has therefore delayed Bevin's original plan to separately conclude alliance treaties with Arab countries. The Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations have also been postponed indefinitely due to the recent large-scale protests by Egyptian students, but they are secretly carrying out other conspiracies to suppress this resistance. Recently, Britain secretly sent sixteen Nazis (eight of whom were former German officers) to Lebanon in an attempt to provoke bloody conflicts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抗议英帝侵略阴谋  中东各国人民示威\n\n1948-02-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    抗议英帝侵略阴谋  中东各国人民示威\n    【新华社陕北三十一日电】综合中东讯：中东各阿拉伯国家人民，群起抗议英帝国主义组织“中东集团”的侵略阴谋。叙利亚首都大马士革居民，二十七日举行抗议大示威，高呼“对英绝交”等口号。示威者并向伊拉克公使递交备忘录，抗议英伊条约及英国与阿拉伯各国签订之一切不平等条约。备忘录严正要求“阿拉伯国家之真正独立。”受外约但国王阿布杜拉迫害而逃亡至大马士革之外约但民主人士，亦纷电阿布杜拉与贝文，严重抗议英国与外约但间缔结新的奴役条约。阿拉伯各国报纸亦均猛烈抨击贝文在签订所谓英伊同盟条约后所称：“该约将为英国与阿拉伯诸国缔结一连串同类条约之开端”的狂妄声明。黎巴嫩电信报称：“黎巴嫩人民屡次声明，他们愿对一切国家保守中立，并与之保持友好关系，我们希望我们的当局为了我们的独立，能神圣地遵守中立”。阿耳布勃拉克报则提醒人民必须警惕贝文的阴谋，并质问“如果缔约一方不与我们商议，就擅自替我们说话，它是不是自命为我们的保护人呢？”\n    【新华社陕北三十一日电】巴格达讯：伊拉克人民反英运动急剧高涨，各地群众连日冲破军警之弹压，英勇举行示威游行。伊摄政伊拉在巴格达十万人民大示威后，不得不于廿七日宣布前总理雅布尔之辞职，并任命前参议院院长萨德尔出组新阁。雅布尔甫自英国与贝文签订所谓“英伊同盟条约”（现已为伊方宣布废除）后奉召返国，现已畏罪化装潜逃外约但首府安曼。\n    巴格达大示威时军警竟以机枪扫射游行群众，死伤达数百人，但人民仍坚持斗争，英勇不屈，现反英运动仍在延续扩展中。据塔斯社中东讯，伊拉克人民对英伊条约之反抗，使英国大为恐惧，已因此延缓贝文原定与阿拉伯各国分别订立同盟条约之计划，英埃订约谈判亦因最近埃及学生之抗议大示威而无期延搁，但暗中则努力进行其他压制此种反抗之阴谋。最近英国即曾密派十六名纳粹分子（其中八名为前德国军官）赴黎巴嫩，企图挑起流血冲突。"

The city was occupied by the second detachment of the joint defense of Zhenping, Neixiang, Xichuan, and Deng counties of the Chiang bandit Henan Provincial Self-Defense Headquarters, a total of eleven security regiments and one directly subordinate battalion, more than 8,000 people. In order to make this fortress even stronger, the Chiang bandits built a five-foot high and three-foot wide barricade outside the two city walls (the city is five li in circumference, and the outer city is twenty-five li in circumference). Bunkers were built under the wall, and the barricade was surrounded by deer fences. Trenches connected the city wall and the barricade, and the water in the outer moat was connected to the water outside the inner city. The Chiang bandit army shrank into this tortoise shell. On the 9th, this large reactionary fortress was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. The Chiang bandits were very flustered and sent more than a dozen planes to bomb the People's Liberation Army positions day and night, and to deliver ammunition to the besieged Chiang bandit army. The People's Liberation Army first destroyed the sluice gate of the outer moat, releasing most of the water in the outer moat. The general offensive was launched at 5 p.m. on the 15th. Under the cover of our powerful artillery fire, the commanders and fighters waded through the water trenches up to their chests, climbed up the city wall, and occupied the outer city in just five minutes. That night, all the enemies in the outer city were wiped out. At dawn on the 16th, they attacked the inner city. Except for a few Chiang bandit troops who jumped into the water and fled, more than 1,000 were killed or drowned, and the remaining 5,600 were all captured.

Watch as the enemy's 26th Division is annihilated under our bayonets!\" This was the bold statement made by the soldiers of a certain unit, who were tasked with the main attack in the Xinlitun campaign, on their combat competition documents. Before the attack began, many soldiers in this unit even wrote \"See Blood with the Bayonet\" on their rifles. As soon as the battle began, under the cover of intense artillery fire, they swept towards the enemy's lines like a whirlwind. In just over thirty minutes, they charged up the high slope, more than 200 meters outside Xinlitun, causing the Chiang bandit officers and soldiers to be terrified, kneeling down and kowtowing, surrendering all their weapons. When the reporter went to observe, he happened to encounter soldier Ma Yonglin escorting prisoners down the mountain. He told the reporter: \"The plan to 'see blood with the bayonet' was wasted. As soon as you charged up to them, they knelt down and surrendered their guns.\" From the night of the 24th to the 25th, our Field Army completely cleared the outer strongholds of Xinlitun: the railway station, Gaoshan (High Mountain), and group fortifications. At 3:00 AM on the 26th, a certain unit of ours began attacking Bajiazi, east of the city. The surrounded Chiang bandits immediately showed signs of wavering. As soon as our artillery test-fired, they were so frightened that they lost their wits. Only one hour after the attack began, the enemy left a small force to cover their retreat, and the main force abandoned all their supplies and more than ten mountain and field guns, quietly slipping out of the city in three routes, fleeing in the northeast, northwest, and southwest directions. Unexpectedly, after fleeing only ten-odd li, they fell into our pre-set ambush circle, and by 10:00 AM, they were completely wiped out. Our attacking troops had, three hours earlier, cleared the remaining enemies in the city and completely occupied Xinlitun.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 敌人跪下了！  攻克新立屯特写\n文清\n1948-02-02\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    敌人跪下了！\n    攻克新立屯特写\n    【新华社东北前线三十一日电】分社记者文清报导：“敌人是孙大圣也逃不出咱解放军的手心，看敌二十六师就在咱刺刀下歼灭”。这是此次新立屯战役中担任主攻任务的某部战士们在作战竞赛书上的豪语。当攻击开始前，该部许多战士还在枪杆上写着：“刺刀见血”的字样。战斗一开始，他们即在猛烈炮火掩护下，一阵旋风似的卷向敌阵，三十多分钟就冲上了新立屯外围二百多公尺的高坡，使蒋匪官兵心胆迸裂，纷纷跪下叩头，交出了全部的武器。当记者前往观察时，正遇战士马永林押解俘虏送往山下。他对记者说：“刺刀见红的计划算是白费了，你一冲到他们跟前，他们就跪下交枪”。我野战兵团从二十四日夜至二十五日一天中，完全扫清新立屯外围据点：车站、高山和集团工事。二十六日晨三时，我某部开始攻击城东之八家子，被围困的蒋匪立即呈现动摇，等我炮兵刚刚试射，就吓得他们丧魂落魄，攻击开始只一小时，敌即留下少数兵力掩护退却，主力即遗弃所有辎重及十余门山野炮，分三路悄悄溜出城外，向东北、西北、西南三个方向逃窜，不料逃出才十多里，又陷入我预设的伏击圈内，战至午前十时即全部覆灭，我攻城部队则在此前三小时，即肃清城内残敌，完全占领新立屯。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editorial\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: The reorganization movement of organs in Harbin City has concluded after two months of democratic discussion. The Northeast Bureau has issued unified regulations covering personnel allocation, living standards, transportation, recreational activities, study systems, etc. (This telegram was published on page one of this newspaper on January 9th - editor). This reorganization is significant as it specifically addresses the issue of organ reorganization after entering a city. As the People's Liberation Army transitions to the offensive, many cities will be liberated, and the entry of the New Democratic regime into cities will become an important characteristic of future development. This situation will present us with a series of new problems that must be properly resolved. We still lack the necessary experience to deal with these problems. The success of the Harbin City organ reorganization movement is therefore worthy of attention, precisely for this reason.\n\n    Cities have concentrated populations, developed transportation, and complete living facilities. Utilizing these conditions effectively, on the positive side, can better serve the people and the war effort. On the negative side, it can reduce the burden on the people and channel saved manpower, materials, and financial resources towards winning the war and advancing construction. However, due to the long-term rule of imperialism and feudal forces in cities, extremely decadent lifestyles have developed there. If resolute steps are not taken ideologically and organizationally to overcome this sinful temptation, phenomena such as corruption, extravagance, hedonism, and disparities in living standards will be more likely to arise and develop than in rural areas. This would negate all the benefits of cities, leaving only the drawbacks. The impact of these drawbacks would be sufficient to corrupt the revolutionary ranks, hinder the victory of the war and the progress of construction work, and even lead to the failure of the revolution. Therefore, every Communist Party member should have a clear understanding when entering a city: their task is to work, not to enjoy comfort. They should work with the urban people and rely on them to transform the city; the acquisition of the city should have a positive impact on the revolution, not a negative one.\n\n    The unified regulations of the Northeast Bureau state: \"The treatment of all cadres must be based on the living standards of middle peasants in rural areas and skilled workers in urban areas and must not exceed them.\" This is an important principle that should be followed not only in cities but also in rural areas; not only during wartime but also at all times. The life of a Communist Party member should only improve with the improvement of the lives of the general public. They have no right to live better than the general public, and they are absolutely not allowed to lead a wasteful and decadent life like bureaucratic compradors, landlords, and capitalists. The unified regulations also state: \"A ten-hour work-study system shall be implemented, with eight hours of work and two hours of study per day.\" This is also an important principle. Communist Party members and revolutionaries should take advantage of the favorable conditions in cities to work hard and study diligently, rather than becoming parasites.\n\n    The unified regulations of the Northeast Bureau, regarding saving personnel and transportation, recreational activities, and fixed office hour systems, when implemented in cities, will not only not reduce work efficiency but will instead increase it. These changes are necessary when moving from rural areas to cities. As the Northeast Daily editorial stated, it is absolutely unacceptable to \"remain stuck in the dispersion of rural life while being tainted by the superficiality of the city, wasting a lot of manpower and resources.\" According to news from the Northeast last November, the headquarters of the Democratic United Army (i.e., the current Northeast People's Liberation Army) implemented streamlining, reducing the number of guards and communicators by more than half, drastically reducing dormitories, cars, and electric lights and telephones, and implementing a fixed work and reception system. As a result, relations between superiors and subordinates and among each other became closer. The Northeast Railway Protection Army Command reduced its personnel by one-third, but work efficiency doubled. These systems, such as fixed work hours and fixed reception hours, are not feasible in rural areas, but in cities, after order has been stabilized, they can and must be implemented. As for the streamlining of personnel and transportation, it can and must be implemented appropriately both in rural and urban areas.\n\n    The Northeast Daily editorial pointed out that the purpose of the Harbin City organ reorganization is to: \"Strengthen organization, unify establishment, improve systems, increase work efficiency, establish a hard-working and simple style, oppose corruption and waste, so that the use of all our manpower, materials, and financial resources, and the style of all our thoughts, work, and life, can adapt to the needs of large-scale warfare.\" This should be done not only in Harbin City but also in all liberated areas without exception. One of the strategic goals of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was to destroy the manpower and resources of the liberated areas, causing them to wither, in order to defeat the People's Liberation Army. The transition of the People's Liberation Army to the offensive and the launch of the land reform movement in the liberated areas have foiled this conspiracy of the Chiang bandits. Faced with the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the inevitable demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is certain. However, we must also prepare for a protracted war, and we must prepare everything to overcome the maximum resistance of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang with the aid of American imperialism in order to achieve complete victory. Recently, the East China Central Bureau decided on streamlining and cleaning-up methods, and the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region is carrying out the same work. This work has been going on for several months in the Jin-Sui and Shaan-Gan-Ning border regions, and these are all very necessary. Not only is this the case in the old liberated areas, but in the newly liberated areas of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, Generals Liu and Deng also called on the People's Liberation Army and local cadres to establish a style and atmosphere of hard work and simplicity, seeking truth from facts, and doing good things for the masses, and to oppose boastfulness, waste, luxury, and extravagance, and not doing good things for the masses. This call is also absolutely necessary for creating new liberated areas and defeating the Chiang bandits. Carrying out reorganization and cleaning-up work together with land reform, party rectification movements, and production and construction will further consolidate the rear of the People's Liberation Army, promote its great strength in supporting the front, and guarantee the complete victory of the just war of the Chinese people against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

After mobilization at the general meeting of all employees in Factory Six, everyone was in high spirits. One hundred percent of the comrades automatically proposed adding three, four, or six days of voluntary labor. Some even wanted to add ten days of voluntary labor last month. In total, the factory dedicated 945 days of voluntary labor. In addition, they made donations totaling 776,500 yuan. According to Factory Six's wage situation, this is equivalent to 776 days of work, which, combined with the voluntary labor, totals 1,721 days of work. This exceeds the predetermined number by 57.1 percent.\n    After the meeting, the workers immediately took action, working twelve hours a day and eating meals in the workshop, demonstrating a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm. Comrades in Factory Five were also very active in donating labor. All employees participated, contributing a total of 1,745 and a half days of voluntary labor and donating 845,500 yuan. Because Factory Five's relocation affected several days of work, the workers immediately carried out installation work at the new location, followed by a large-scale production surge. Thanks to the special efforts of all workers, in December, they not only made up for the losses caused by the relocation but also exceeded the production plan by 30 percent.\n    [Another Item] Last year, under the call to create a \"Liu Bocheng Factory\" and support the front lines, all employees of the Military Industry Department's Factory Five maintained an unprecedented level of production enthusiasm from beginning to end, not only successfully completing the annual task but also exceeding the target by an average of 29.6 percent. In the spring and summer seasons, they generally exceeded the target by more than 20 percent. In the autumn, in order to reduce costs and prepare for relocation, all employees, with a high degree of political awareness, voluntarily switched from piecework to hourly work. The production enthusiasm not only did not decrease but instead exceeded that of the piecework period. Output increased month by month, eventually exceeding the target by 29 percent. In the last quarter, in order to ensure that relocation did not disrupt production, all employees worked tirelessly, regardless of fatigue and fear of difficulties, simultaneously constructing and producing, maximizing labor intensity. As a result, the relocation task was completed in half a month, and work was quickly resumed. During the winter summary, the target was exceeded by 40 percent.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 生产节约支援前线  军工处各厂献义务工  五厂去年超过任务百分之三十\n\n1948-02-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    生产节约支援前线\n    军工处各厂献义务工\n    五厂去年超过任务百分之三十\n    【本报消息】据军工处职工周报载：军工处管辖的各工厂工人努力生产，支援前线，献了好多义务工。六厂在全体职工大会上动员后，大家情绪很高。全体同志百分之百的自动提出：加三个、四个、六个义务工。有的在上月要加十个义务工。总计全厂共献义务工九百四十五个。又进行了献金，共计七十七万六千五百元。按六厂工资情形，折合七百七十六个工，与献工合计共一千七百廿一个工。比预定数超过了百分之五十七点一。\n    会后工人们立刻行动起来，每天作十二小时工，饭都是在工房里吃，表现出对革命的高度热情。五厂同志们献工也很积极，全体职工没有一个不参加的，共献义务工一千七百四十五个半，献金八十四万五千五百元。五厂因为迁移厂址，影响了几天工作，工友们到了新驻地，立时进行按装工作，随着展开生产大突击。因为全体工友特别努力，在十二月份不但把迁移的损失补上，还超过了生产计划百分之三十。\n    【又息】军工处五厂去年在创造刘伯承工厂与支援前线的号召下，全体职工从开始到最后，都是抱着空前未有的生产热情，不但胜利的完成了全年的任务，而且平均超过任务百分之二十九点六强。春夏两季，普遍超过任务百分之二十还多。秋季为了降低成本与准备搬家，全体职工在高度的政治觉悟下，自动由包工转为例工，生产情绪不但没有减低，反而超过了包工时期。产量逐月提高，最后超过了任务的百分之二十九。在最末一季，为了作到搬家不误生产，全体职工不顾疲劳，不怕困难，一面建设、一面生产，劳动强度发挥到顶点，结果半月即将搬家任务完成，并很快的复工了。冬季总结时，超过任务百分之四十。"

    "content": "*Pravda*\n\tBy Z. Hailin\n\tTranslated by Cao Ying\n\tIn this massive edifice resembling a steamship, the lights never go out. In the skies above Moscow, like a bright flame, a word burns all night long – a word connected to the heroic revolutionary struggle of the Soviet people to realize communism. These are six dazzling letters:\n\tPRAVDA (Truth)\n\tEarly in the morning, the streets of Moscow are still deserted, and Leningrad Avenue is also empty. However, several trucks covered with tarpaulins appear on this avenue early in the morning.\n\tThey drive one after another from \"Pravda Street,\" and it is not difficult to follow them on such an early morning. The trucks drive to all the post offices and postal agencies in the capital. They rush to the railway stations and airports. The trucks are loaded with brown paper bags covered with tarpaulins. Inside the bags are neatly arranged bundles of daily newspapers and magazines published by \"Pravda Publishing House\" on that day. Two or three hours later, all these paper bags set out on their journeys. The postal vehicles distributing \"Pravda\" travel 121,394 kilometers along railway lines alone. More than 50,000 post offices deliver daily newspapers and magazines from \"Pravda Publishing House\" to subscribers.\n\t\"For clarity,\" Lenin wrote in February 1921, \"let us take a small number as an example: throughout Russia, 'Izvestia' sells 350,000 copies, and 'Pravda' sells 250,000 copies. We are poor, we have no paper.\"\n\tFifteen years later, Stalin said at the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of the Union: \"Furthermore: everyone talks about freedom of speech, assembly, and publication, but forgets that all these freedoms can become an empty sound for the working class if it cannot obtain suitable meeting places, good printing presses, and sufficient paper.\"\n\tIn the Soviet Union, the working class possesses these conditions. Even those who previously \"found Moscow unbelievable\" based on personal understanding have indeed come to believe this. In 1937, the writer Lion Feuchtwanger, who visited the editorial office of \"Pravda,\" described his impressions:\n\t\"I visited the new printing plant of 'Pravda,' the best-selling daily newspaper in Moscow. We wandered around the massive rotary press, which has the world's leading productivity; it prints two million copies of the newspaper in two hours. The entire printing press is like a huge locomotive, and its platform, which is eighty meters long, is like the deck of a steamship, where one can stroll. After wandering around the printing press for about a quarter of an hour, I suddenly noticed that this machine only occupied half of the factory building, and the other half was empty. I asked why. The answer was: 'Now we only print two million copies of 'Pravda.' But we still have five million subscription applications. As soon as our paper mill can supply us with enough paper, we will install a second printing press.'\"\n\tThe war hindered the installation of this machine. During the war, factories were busy fulfilling military orders. Soviet paper mills suffered severe blows from the occupiers. However, \"Pravda\" has grown vigorously during these years.\n\t... Let's run inside the \"Pravda\" building and take a look! Trains loaded with paper come here every day along their own specially built railway branch line. On the platform, we can meet a middle-aged man wearing glasses. Like a shrewd boss, he attentively watches the unloading of the train. His name is Vasily Antonovich Prikhodzhiko. On April 22nd (May 5th, New Style) of the old lunar calendar in 1912, he composed the first issue of \"Pravda.\" This day became the Bolshevik publishing festival. Dozens of Lenin's and Stalin's manuscripts have passed through Prikhodzhiko's hands. He remembers very clearly the situation when Molotov served as the secretary of the \"Pravda\" editorial department.\n\t\"Molotov always came to our typesetting room with the proof sheets he had proofread. He would not leave the printing plant until the newspaper was published,\" Prikhodzhiko recalled. \"We often asked Comrade Molotov when he slept. During the day, he worked in the editorial department, and at night he worked in the night editorial department, until the newspaper was published, and he even helped distribute the newspaper, sending it to factories everywhere.\"\n\t\"In the past, all typesetting was based on the author's manuscript. Each time, various different fonts had to be changed. Comrade Molotov often helped the typesetting workers, explaining to them the meaning of individual words and articles.\"\n\tWe listen to the simple and unadorned conversation of the oldest worker of \"Pravda,\" who is still working in the newspaper office. As he speaks, rolls of new newspapers slide along the wooden conveyor into the rotary press. If the newspapers used by \"Pravda\" Publishing House in one year were connected together, then this strip could circle the earth fifteen times.\n\tThe former typesetting foreman describes how Lenin and Stalin used workers' donations to start a small newspaper, and how this small newspaper grew into today's \"Pravda\" – it is a very touching story.\n\tBetween the lines of \"Pravda,\" the heartbeat of the powerful Soviet state is hidden. In September 1945, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party awarded the Order of Lenin to \"Pravda,\" it said that it believed that \"'Pravda' will continue to gloriously carry out the task of the standard-bearer of Lenin-Stalin party consciousness, and use the power of Bolshevik language to encourage the Soviet people to complete new labor achievements in order to continue to consolidate the power of our great socialist motherland, and economic and cultural prosperity.\"\n\t... In 1941, the glass windows of the \"Pravda\" building rattled from the shock waves of shells. On a plane surveying instrument of a German pilot shot down over Moscow, a map was found. On this map, 24 Pravda Street (the location of the \"Pravda\" building x) was also marked with a cross, just like the most important military targets in the capital.\n\tHowever, \"Pravda\" never stopped its work for a minute during these difficult years. Moreover, airplanes loaded with paper plates were still sent to besieged Leningrad as usual every morning. The printing plant in Leningrad that printed \"Pravda\" was often under siege by artillery fire. Printing workers worked in hunger and cold. The pilots transporting the paper plates were forced to land several times under the gunfire of German anti-aircraft guns. Two airplanes were shot down. However, the paper plates continued to arrive in Leningrad, and the residents of this heroic city never lost their motherland's newspaper.\n\tNow, the paper plates of \"Pravda\" are sent to Kyiv, Kharkiv, the Don, Rostov, Baku, Tashkent, Novosibirsk, Kuibyshev, and recently also to Khabarovsk. The planes transporting the paper plates travel 22,000 kilometers every day.\n\tThe versions of \"Pravda\" even extend to places that trains and ships cannot reach, airplanes do not land, and cars and trucks cannot pass. In the Allaikha region of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (in the far north of Siberia), newspapers and magazines are delivered by reindeer and dogs. Residents of Anadyr (in the far east of Siberia) can also receive publications published by \"Pravda\" Publishing House. Thirty-six subscribers to \"Pravda\" live in Nikolskoye village in the Kamchatka Oblast, Aleutian District. Gold miners in Aldan also subscribe to \"Pravda,\" \"Komsomolskaya Pravda,\" \"Culture and Life,\" \"Bolshevik,\" \"Spark,\" and \"Young Pioneer,\" etc.\n\tResidents of Uzhhorod, who previously could not see Soviet publications, now subscribe to 3,722 copies of daily newspapers and magazines published by \"Pravda\" Publishing House. There are 2,829 subscribers in Mukachevo (Uzhhorod and Mukachevo are on the border between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia). In the former Königsberg, now Kaliningrad, there are 13,192 subscribers. Residents of South Sakhalin Island (Karafuto Prefecture) regularly receive 904 daily newspapers and 839 magazines.\n\t\"Pravda\" and its other publications are also read outside the Soviet Union. It extends to the most remote corners of the earth. Its subscribers are distributed in 59 countries. The magazine \"Spark\" can be received in 43 countries, including: Australia, India, New Zealand, Cuba, Chile, South Africa... There are 55 subscribers in India. There are 1,316 subscribers in Palestine.\n\tThousands of tangible and intangible lines connect \"Pravda\" with every corner of the world, but first of all with the various nationalities of the Soviet Federation. The mail that \"Pravda\" sends and receives every day is almost no less than all the mail of a small city. There is no event that is not immediately reported to \"Pravda.\" The \"Pravda\" building occupies 70,000 square meters. However, if the space occupied by the daily newspaper correspondents distributed throughout the Soviet Union is added together, then this area is not known how much larger it would be.\n\tThe most famous scholars, writers, party and economic workers, ministers and workers, farmers and students publish articles in \"Pravda.\" Every Soviet citizen deeply loves their newspaper and trusts the ideas hidden within it. They ask the newspaper for instructions, make suggestions, and ask for help.\n\tStalin's \"Pravda\" printing plant works day and night.\n\tBefore newspapers and magazines fall into the hands of readers, they must go through nearly a hundred complex production procedures. Every line of words is the result of long and tenacious labor. However, the staff in the newspaper office know how much Soviet readers cherish their labor and how much they long for the Bolshevik truth.\n\tWhen the workers who print the daily newspapers go home in the morning, they are greeted by the workers who print the magazines. At midnight, those who work next to the large rotary presses come out again. At one o'clock at night, the paper workers load the rolls of paper onto the machines. Then the machine printers and foremen also come, and they prepare the machines for printing. At this time, the typesetting machine typesets the last few lines of words. At four or five o'clock in the morning, the most tense moment in the printing plant begins. Everyone is waiting for the last column signed by the editor. Eighteen to twenty minutes later, a fresh newspaper must be placed on the editor's desk.\n\tIn these few minutes of tense time, when the first manuscript is sent from the pneumatic delivery station (a new method of delivering mail), there is not much time left. But in this short period of time, every second is like a spring, and the rhythm of life of these people is like this. They have dedicated everything. They have not known the silence of the night for decades. The whole country should receive fresh newspapers in the morning.\n\tIn addition to \"Pravda,\" \"Komsomolskaya Pravda,\" and \"Culture and Life,\" the following magazines are also printed here: \"Bolshevik,\" \"Historical Problems,\" \"Farm Woman,\" \"Crocodile,\" \"World Economy and World Politics,\" \"Spark\" and its various supplements, as well as \"October,\" \"Party Life,\" \"Young Pioneer,\" \"Working Woman,\" \"Alternation,\" \"Soviet Women,\" \"Soviet Books,\" etc.\n\tAfter all the paper, covers and magazine inserts are printed, they are sent to the binding workshop. Only magazines that come out of here become the way the mailman delivers them to us. But before that, it has to go through several inspection procedures. Every page of paper, every magazine must be proofread. The inspector's number must also be stamped on it. Before packing and affixing labels – \"Spark\" fifteen issues sixty copies – each magazine must be proofread again. Now, the whole bundles of magazines slide along the transport tubes to the post office's car. From here, the magazines reach the hands of subscribers...\n\tDays full of new events and heroic deeds of the Soviet people are coming every day. The people in the building at 24 Pravda Street who prepare the materials for daily newspapers and magazines are always the first to know these things. In this huge building, whether it is Sunday or a major holiday, the boiling life never stops for a minute.

    "content": "Zanhuang Convenes Meeting of Poor and Middle Peasants and Rural Cadres\n    Large-Scale Promotion of the Land Law\n\n    [Zanhuang News] After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, the masses in various villages were very concerned, but because there was no good publicity and explanation, the thinking of some masses was quite confused. The county leadership discovered this situation and quickly summoned the responsible cadres of each district for discussion. In the middle of this month, they held meetings of about 1,600 poor, middle peasants, and village cadres at the base points of each district to discuss the Outline Land Law, aiming to dispel the masses' misunderstandings about the Land Law and continue to implement winter production. The meeting revealed the following: First, poor and hired peasants urgently demand to hold power. A poor peasant from Douling Village said, \"Last year during the overthrow, the district, county, and commissioner's office all said that poor and hired tenant farmers were the backbone, but when it came to the struggle, we were called the backbone, and when it came to dividing the fruits, we were no longer the backbone.\" Poor peasants from Beima Village, Fengjia Village, Yanhuy, Gushan, Nanxingguo and other villages all said that they did not dare to speak in the village. A poor peasant from Jiaying Temple said, \"When discussing loans, the poor and hired peasants came up with six households, but the village cadres did not follow through. I didn't get a loan either, and the cadres still made the decisions.\" When the fifth district held a meeting, poor and hired peasants from Wujia Village, Beihao and other villages did not dare to speak at the meeting or in the group, and pulled the person in charge of the meeting aside to speak outside the village. A poor and hired peasant from Beihao asked, \"Can we be the masters or not?\" Second, some village cadres are afraid of poor and hired peasants holding power. For example, some village cadres in the first district said, \"From now on, whether we have anything or not, the poor and hired peasants will speak,\" \"If the poor and hired peasants tell us to step down, we will step down.\" The Guo Zhuang village cadres, after receiving the notice, did not call the poor and middle peasants to participate in the meeting, and excused themselves by saying, \"We saw that the notice had cadres, so we didn't read further.\" Third, middle peasants are afraid of touching floating wealth. Some middle peasants said, \"Let them have the land if they want it, but it's not comfortable to have another family move in when I already live in one house,\" \"It's really not good to divide things up equally.\" During the group discussion and explanation, the leadership particularly emphasized that poor and hired peasants must hold power, affirm that the middle peasants will not be touched, upper-middle peasants will not have their floating wealth touched, and as long as cadres stand on the side of the poor and hired peasants, work hard now to organize poor and hired peasants in production, and work hard in the future to lead poor and hired peasants to turn over, those who share more fruits should prepare to withdraw early and still be good cadres. The issue of prohibiting landlords, rich peasants, and speculators from selling, destroying, and wasting property was also discussed, and everyone was called upon to supervise. (Zanhuang Joint Office)\n\n    This method of large-scale promotion of the Land Law can enable all farmers to accept the Land Law positively, stabilize the middle peasants and some village cadres, and expose various distortions and rumors. This is good. However, in some places, many poor and hired peasants are still oppressed and dare not speak. Using this method alone is obviously not enough. The cadres of the Licun Gou District went deep into the poor and hired peasants' homes to inquire about their suffering, publicize the Land Law, and patiently explain it. Only when they understand it can they truly speak their hearts, break all kinds of worries, and take active action to ensure the thorough implementation of the Land Law.\n      -- Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 赞皇召集贫中农村干会  大规模宣传土地法\n\n1948-02-02\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    赞皇召集贫中农村干会\n    大规模宣传土地法\n    【赞皇消息】土地法大纲公布后，各村群众都很关心，但是因为没有很好的宣传解释，有些群众的思想相当混乱。县领导上发现了这种情形，赶紧召集各区负责干部讨论了一下，又在本月中旬，在各区分基点召开了约一千六百人的雇贫中农及村干会议，讨论土地法太纲，目的在于解除群众对土地法的误解，继续贯彻冬季生产。在这次会上看出来：第一、雇贫农迫切要求掌权。陡岭村贫农说：“去年翻身时，区里、县里、专员公署里都说贫雇佃为骨干，可是闹斗争时叫俺当骨干，到分果实时就不成骨干了”。北马村、冯家村、延虎、孤山、南邢郭等村贫农都提出在村里不敢说话。嘉应寺贫农说：“贷款时雇贫农讨论出了六户，村干部不照办，我也没贷下，还是由干部做主”。五区开会时，武家村、北毫等村贫雇不敢在会上说，也不敢在小组里说，把主持会的负责人抽空拉到村外去说。北毫贫雇问：“到底能当家不能哩？”第二、部分村干怕贫雇掌权。如一区村干组有的村干说：“今后有啥没啥，贫雇说话吧”，“贫雇叫咱下台就下台”。郭庄村干接通知后，竟没叫雇贫中农去参加会，并借口说：“我们见通知上有干部，就没往下看”。第三、中农怕动浮财。有的中农说：“土地给就给点吧，自己住了一处房，再住进一家来可是不顺劲”，“东西打乱平分实在不好”。在小组讨论与解释中，领导上特别着重指出：贫雇必须掌权，肯定中农不动，上中农不动浮财，干部只要站在贫雇方面，现在努力组织贫雇生产，将来努力领导贫雇翻身，多分果实的早点准备退出，还能当个好干部。对禁止地主富农及投机分子变卖破坏浪费财产等事情也作了讨论，号召大家起来监督。  （赞皇联合办公室）\n    这种大规模宣传土地法的方式，可使全体农民正面的接受土地法，稳定中农和一部分村干部，揭破各种曲解和谣言，这是好的。但是，有些地方许多贫雇还受着压迫，不敢讲话，只用这种方式显然不够，李村沟区干部深入贫雇访苦，宣传土地法，耐心解释，他们懂得了，才能真正说出知心话，打破各种顾虑，积极行动起来，保证土地法彻底实现。\n      ——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to various sources: On the 29th, the Chiang bandit authorities in Shanghai orchestrated military police and cavalry to brutally suppress the just anti-oppression movement of students from Tongji University and other schools, stabbing, beating, and arresting as many as 150 to 160 students from Tongji, Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, and St. John's Universities. Earlier, in mid-January, the Kuomintang training department of Tongji University suppressed the student union and expelled eleven students, arousing the common indignation of Tongji students. After repeatedly requesting the school to retract the order without success, they could no longer tolerate it and went on strike starting on the 18th, deciding to collectively petition in Nanjing on the 29th. After learning of this, Wu Guozhen, the Chiang bandit mayor, traitor, and fascist bandit, sent police chief Yu Shude and others twice on the evening of the 28th to intimidate them, but the students' will was firm and they were unmoved.\n\nOn the morning of the 29th, Tongji students gathered at the Meilu Engineering College, along with students from Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, and St. John's Universities who came to support the just actions of the Tongji students, totaling 5,000 people (Associated Press). Just as the students were about to depart for the railway station, the Chiang bandits had already dispatched dozens of armored vehicles and over 3,000 fully armed military police and secret agents (Reuters) to surround the school gate, preventing the students from taking a single step out. The Chiang bandit mayor Wu Guozhen personally went to threaten them, forcing the students to stop the petition. The students insisted on not yielding. By the afternoon, the Chiang bandit military police, who had been lying in wait outside the school, under the command of the Shanghai Garrison Commander, bandit Xuan Tiewu, used bayonets and broadswords to beat, stab, and arrest unarmed students; at night, they rushed into the dormitories to search and arrest people. According to Agence France-Presse, the Chiang bandits \"arrested 120 students,\" and United Press said \"30 to 40 students were beaten.\" Although the Shanghai Chiang bandit authorities concealed the number of students beaten, they also admitted to arresting 97 students from various schools.\n\nIn addition to suppressing students with violence, the Chiang bandits also instigated their puppet Shanghai Municipal Council and Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue circular telegrams, demanding that the Chiang bandits severely punish \"illegal students.\" Hang Liwu, the Chiang bandit's Deputy Minister of Education, also rushed to Shanghai from Nanjing on the evening of the 29th with a \"dissolution order,\" claiming that Tongji University would be \"dissolved.\" The bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek personally issued a \"handwritten order,\" clamoring to \"eliminate\" the student forces in various universities and specialized colleges who were participating in the anti-oppression struggle, attempting to use this to continue persecuting students and coercing students to resume classes.\n\nThis shocking atrocity has aroused great indignation among students and the general public in Shanghai. The anti-oppression sentiments of students from Tongji, Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, and St. John's Universities have become even more intense.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海同济交通复旦等校学生  英勇反抗蒋匪压迫  军警捕杀学生百余引起人民更大激愤\n\n1948-02-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    上海同济交通复旦等校学生\n    英勇反抗蒋匪压迫\n    军警捕杀学生百余引起人民更大激愤\n    【新华社陕北一日电】据各方消息：上海蒋匪当局，二十九日策动军警、马队残酷镇压同济大学等校学生正义的反压迫运动，刺伤殴伤及逮捕同济、交通、复旦、暨南及圣约翰等校学生竟达一百五六十人之多。先是，一月中旬，同济大学蒋党训导处压迫学生自治会，并开除学生十一名，激起同济学生的共愤，数度要求校方收回乱命无效，乃忍无可忍于十八日起实行罢课，并决定于二十九日集体赴南京请愿。蒋匪市长卖国贼法西斯匪徒吴国桢获悉后，于二十八日晚派警察局长俞匪叔平等两度前往恫吓，但学生意志坚决，不为所动。\n    廿九日晨，同济学生集中其美路工学院，连同支持该校学生正义行动前往送行之交通、复旦、暨南及圣约翰等校学生人数共达五千人（美联社）。正当学生启程赴车站之际，蒋匪早已出动装甲车数十辆、全副武装军警特务三千余名（路透社）包围校门，不让学生外出一步，蒋匪市长吴国桢并亲自前往威吓，强迫学生停止请愿，学生坚持不屈，至当日下午，预伏校外的蒋匪军警随即在沪市警备司令宣匪铁吾指挥之下，以刺刀、大刀、殴刺和逮捕徒手学生；入夜又冲入宿舍肆行搜查、逮捕。据法新社报导蒋匪“捕去学生一百二十人”，合众社说“殴伤学生三、四十人”。上海蒋匪当局虽隐没殴伤学生数目，但亦承认捕去各校学生九十七人。\n    蒋匪除以暴力镇压学生外，并唆使其御用的所谓上海市参议会、市商会等，发表通电，要求蒋匪对“不法学生”严予惩处。蒋匪教育部次长杭立武亦于廿九日晚携“解散令”由南京赶往上海，声称将“解散”同济大学，匪首蒋介石并亲自发出“手令”，扬言将“消灭”各大学及专科学院参加反压迫斗争的学生势力，企图借此继续迫害学生并威迫学生复课。\n    此一震动全国的暴行，已引起沪市学生及广大市民万分激愤。同济、交通、复旦、暨南及圣约翰等校学生反压迫情绪更趋激昂。"

    "content": "Middle Peasants Understand the Land Law, Production Immediately Picks Up\n    [Left Right News] Most of the village cadres in Wangjiadian Village, District 7, are illiterate. When the Land Law was transmitted to the village, they didn't understand it clearly, so they couldn't publicize it well. Two situations arose in the village: The hired and poor peasants, who had overturned their situation more thoroughly last year, took an indifferent attitude towards the Land Law, thinking, \"We don't care about whether it's redistributed or not.\" The wealthy middle peasants were afraid. For example, Chen Laixiu said: \"Last year, the landlord Zhang Renzi said to me: 'Struggle is like cutting leeks, this year it's me, next year it will be you.' Now, hearing about another equal distribution, I myself am scared. I don't want to plan anything, I'm just afraid that my donkey will be divided. I'd be happy to give up the land, but I can't figure out the donkey.\" The village chief is a new middle peasant, with some surplus grain, and is afraid that the masses will divide it, but he's afraid in his heart and doesn't dare to say it, fearing that the masses will report him. On the 18th of this month, hired and poor peasant cadres went to the district to discuss the Land Law. They studied in the district for two days before they finally understood it. When they returned to the village, they first publicized and discussed it with the hired and poor peasants. During the discussion, cadre Shi Yuzhu said: \"I received an extra sheep last year, and I will give it back to the masses during the equal distribution.\" Two or three other cadres also talked like this. At the middle peasant meeting, the supplementary measures of the Border Region Government were discussed: The surplus property of wealthy middle peasants will not be touched, and land exceeding the limit will be voluntarily given up. And once they understood what surplus property was (livestock, grain, farm tools, etc.), the middle peasants were relieved. Laixiu said: \"Now I can rest assured. The struggle is not like cutting leeks, my things are still mine. What am I afraid of? From now on, I must work hard.\" Since understanding the Outline, sixty-year-old Chen Laixiu has been carrying charcoal to the city, eighty catties per load, attending every market day. He said, \"When people are happy, they are energetic.\"\n            (Joint Office, Zhang Baojiang, Shi Ming, Wei Rong)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中农弄清土地法  生产立时起了劲\n联合办公室  张保江  世明  维荣\n1948-02-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中农弄清土地法  生产立时起了劲\n    【左权消息】七区王家店村干部大部不识字，土地法传达到村，他们就没有闹清楚，宣传也就宣传不好。在村里产生了两种情况：去年翻身较彻底的雇贫，对土地法是不理态度，分不分咱不管。富裕中农害怕，如陈来秀说：“去年地主张任子和我说：斗争好比割韭菜，今年是我，明年就是你。现在听到又平分呀，我自己就害了怕。我是啥也不结计，就是怕分了我的驴。地往出拿我还高兴哩，驴就啥时也想不通。”村长是个新中农，粮食有些富裕，害怕群众分了，但心害怕，嘴上不敢说，怕群众反映。在本月十八日雇贫干部到区讨论土地法，在区里学习了两天，才算闹通。回村就先给雇贫宣传讨论。在讨论时干部史玉珠说：我去年多分了一只羊，到平分时我要给群众拿出来。又有两三个干部也是这样谈。在中农会议上讨论边府的补充办法：富裕中农浮财不动，地多余了自愿往出拿。并且知道了啥是浮财（牲口、粮食、农具等），中农这才放了心。来秀说：“这我可算放下心了，斗争不是割韭菜，咱的东西还是咱哩。咱还怕啥？往后可要好好受哩。”自从清楚了大纲后，六十岁的老汉陈来秀往城担木炭，一担八十斤，每集都到，他说：“人高兴了精神也就壮了。”\n            （联合办公室、张保江、世明、维荣）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS, Paris reports: The National Farmers' Conference initiated by the French Communist Party solemnly opened in Paris on the 27th \"in an atmosphere of extremely high political enthusiasm.\" Eight hundred and fifty farmer representatives from all over France attended the meeting. In addition to farmer representatives, the presidium of the conference included members of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, such as Thorez, Duclos, and Marty. Gasan, Chairman of the Presidium, first paid tribute in his opening speech to the French farmer representatives participating in the conference to defend national interests. He then pointed out that France's national interests are currently facing unprecedented danger. The Socialist Party, together with the de Gaulle reactionaries and the Popular Republican Movement, are forcing farmers to bear heavier taxes than the old regime and are sending farmers into the hands of American reactionary capital institutions. Gasan vehemently called out, \"We cannot allow our ancient country of laborers to succumb to the empire of money!\" and emphatically stated that the French Communist Party will stand with the farmers and provide them with unlimited support. Rochet, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, then gave a long report, which was met with thunderous applause from the audience. Rochet first pointed out that due to the reactionary government's submission to American imperialism and its absurd policies that destroy agriculture, \"France's total agricultural output in 1947 only reached 70 percent of the pre-war level.\" \"We have not only lost bread, but we also have to seek things that can be produced domestically from abroad. At present, our agriculture is also threatened by the Mayer Plan and the entire political program of the Schuman government.\" Rochet said that the tax burden on poor farmers in 1948 will reach 69 billion to 77 billion francs. The Schuman government uses this to maintain huge military expenditures, attempting to use the army to oppose the people, and then harness the army like livestock onto the American war chariot in order to prepare to launch a war against the Soviet Union and nations that refuse to submit to dollar rule. Rochet emphatically stated, \"The French Communist Party will, as before, fight against this plan that further impoverishes workers and peasants.\" Rochet concluded by saying that the policy of surrendering to American imperialism has created a threat to world peace. He declared that the movement to organize agricultural protection committees has been launched nationwide, and this organization is based on a program of struggle against Mayer's destruction of agriculture to curry favor with American expansionists. He briefly pointed out that the specific goal of the committee is: \"All French farmers must unite within the agricultural protection committee to defend farmers' land, peace, and national independence.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 为保卫土地、和平、独立团结起来！  法共召开全国农民会议  组织农业保护委员会的运动已在全国展开\n\n1948-02-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    为保卫土地、和平、独立团结起来！\n    法共召开全国农民会议\n    组织农业保护委员会的运动已在全国展开\n    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社巴黎讯：由法共发起的全国农民会议，二十七日“在政治热情极高的气氛中”于巴黎隆重揭幕。出席会议的，有来自法国各地的农民代表八百五十人。大会主席团中，除农民代表外，还有法共中委多列士、杜克洛、马尔梯等人。主席团主席加善在开幕辞中，首向参加会议以保卫国家利益的法国农民代表们致敬。接着指出：目前法国的国家利益，正面临着空前的危险。社会党与戴高乐反动派和人民共和运动党一道，将比旧政权更重的租税强迫农民负担，并把农民们送到美国反动资本机构的掌心之中。加善力呼：“我们不能容许我们劳动者的古国屈服于金元帝国。”并力称：法共将与农民站在一起，并予以无限的支持。法共中委之一罗雪尔继作长篇报告，全场报以雷动的喝彩。罗氏首先指出：由于反动政府屈从美帝和毁灭农业的荒谬政策，“一九四七年法国农业总产量仅达战前水平百分之七十”。“我们不但失掉了面包，而且国内能生产的东西也不得不求之于国外。目前，我国农业亦受到迈耶计划及舒曼政府整个政治纲领的威胁。”罗氏说：一九四八年贫苦农民租税的负担，将达六百九十亿至七百七十亿法郎之巨。舒曼政府以之维持了庞大的军费，企图利用军队来反对人民，然后将军队象牲口一样套在美国战车上，以便准备发动反对苏联及拒绝屈服于美元统治的各民族的战争。罗氏力称：“法共仍将如前一样，为反对这一使工农更趋贫困的计划而奋斗”。罗氏结语说：对美帝国主义屈服的政策，造成了对全世界和平的威胁。他宣称：组织农业保护委员会的运动，已在全国展开，这个组织是根据反对迈耶毁灭农业以取媚于美扩张主义者的斗争纲领而成立的。他扼要地指出了该委员会的具体目标是：“法国全体农民为保卫农民土地、和平、及国家独立，必须在农业保护委员会内团结起来”。"

Ordinary taxes include public grain, purchased grain, pillbox donations, household donations, business donations, etc. The business donation involves extorting mules and horses from merchants, with first-class merchants required to provide 20, middle-class 15, and lower-class at least 5. If one less mule or horse is handed over, a substitute payment of 6 million Jiaozi currency is required. The Wang Sheng Tai firm was once forced to hand over ten mules and horses each. Bicycles and rickshaws must pay a road tax of 100,000 Jiaozi currency per month. Vehicles, regardless of size, must pay a road tax of 50,000 Jiaozi currency as soon as they leave the suburbs. Pedestrians must also pay 500 Jiaozi currency to buy an exit permit, otherwise, it is impossible to move an inch. Residents have to pay 17,000 Jiaozi currency when they receive their ID cards. Small traders, whether on the street or in the open-air market, must pay a landing tax. Bandit Fu has a special agency in the open-air market, and they hold a meter stick to measure the ground occupied by the vendors and set the amount of the landing tax. Those without a license must pay 10,000 Jiaozi currency per day, porters pay 8,000 Jiaozi currency, and even those selling cigarettes retail must pay 5,000 Jiaozi currency. Moving to another location requires another payment. Under the ravages and extortion of Bandit Fu, prices are rising daily, and the citizens are suffering greatly and are eager to be liberated as soon as possible. A folk song is now popular among the citizens: \"Chiang Kai-shek is damned, Fu Nitou (referring to Fu Zuoyi as a tortoise), oppresses us so we really can't bear it.

In a certain battle, many shells fell near the dressing station of Doctor Li Qingxi of the Third Battalion of the \"Jinzhou\" unit, but he was not afraid and continued to bandage the wounded. Finally, the road for transporting the wounded was cut off and the troops had already moved. However, there were still two wounded soldiers at the dressing station. Doctor Li resolutely rescued the wounded from danger, telling two young nurses to carry one person each and evacuate first. He carried one person on his back and evacuated last. The wounded soldier died on his back during the retreat. He used his hands to dig earth on the spot to bury him, and then rushed forward to rescue another wounded soldier. The soldiers all said that he \"forgot himself when he saw the wounded.\" After the First Institute of the Second Field Hospital accepted its task from higher authorities, it marched 600 *li* continuously to reach its destination. All personnel, regardless of their marching fatigue, quickly set up a temporary hospital and launched a \"laundry for the wounded\" campaign, and all personnel in the institute were swept up in this upsurge. In order to save civilian labor, the institute did not use military porters when moving its station. The staff formed their own stretcher team, and the cooks had not slept for two nights to steam buns for the wounded. They even competed to carry stretchers when they set off. One night, Doctor Bian Qizeng of the First Rear Hospital went to many villages to change bandages for the wounded. He accidentally fell off a cliff in the dark and was injured, but he did not mention it to anyone. He continued to work as usual the next day, enduring the pain. Many other staff members also showed the same enthusiasm in caring for the suffering of the masses. Wang Hongrang, a poor peasant in Xue Village, Lishi, had been in labor for two days without delivering. His wife's life was in danger. The First Field Hospital immediately performed an operation to rescue her, ensuring the safety of both mother and child. The hospital staff cared for her day and night until she was discharged. The number of medical personnel who performed meritorious service in the Fifth Field Hospital alone reached seventy-nine.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全心全意为伤病员服务  晋绥涌现许多模范医务人员\n\n1948-02-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    全心全意为伤病员服务\n    晋绥涌现许多模范医务人员\n    【新华社晋绥三十一日电】此间各医院工作人员在贺龙将军“全心全意为伤病员服务”的号召下，半年来出现许多可歌可泣的事例和模范人物。在某次战斗中，“津州”部三营医生李清兮的绷扎所附近落了很多炮弹，但他毫无惧色，仍为伤员包扎伤口，最后运送伤员的道路被截断，部队业已转移，但绷扎所还有两个伤员，李医生坚决抢救伤员出险，叫两个小护士共背一人，先撤退下去，自己背着一人最后撤退。撤退途中伤员死在他的背上，他使用两手就地掘土安埋，然后再跟上前去抢救另一伤员。战士们都说他“见了伤员忘了自己”。第二野战医院第一所接受上级任务后，连续行军六百里赶到目的地，全体人员不顾行军疲劳，迅速设立临时医院，发动“为伤员洗衣”运动，全所人员均卷入这一热潮。为节省民力，该所于转移驻地时，不动用军勤。工作人员自组担架队，炊事员为给伤员蒸馍，已两夜未眠，出发时还争抬担架。某夜第一后方医院医生边齐曾到许多村庄给伤员换绷带，在漆黑中失足堕崖受伤，但他不向任何人提及此事。次日忍痛照常工作。另有许多工作人员更以同样热情关切群众疾苦，离石薛村贫农王鸿让之妻生产两日不下，生命危殆，第一野战医院即为其开刀急救，母婴俱保安全，医院人员并日夜侍候，直至出院。仅第五野战医院立功之医务人员即达七十九人。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Poor and Hired Labor Cadres in Nangou\n    Divide Labor to Lead Village Production\n    [Pingding News] Nangou, a natural village belonging to Zhangzhuang in the first district of Pingding, had 55 households before the war. Apart from four old middle-peasant households, the remaining 51 households were all from poor tenant-peasant backgrounds, renting over 300 mu of land from landlords. They suffered from landlord exploitation and were always in poverty and hunger. Since liberation, although they initially turned over through rent reduction and debt liquidation, there are still 23 poor peasant households in the village. Due to this year's poor harvest and famine, the entire village of 248 people harvested only 235 shi of grain, averaging less than one shi of grain per person, how can they eat for a year? Therefore, the difficulties are great. The village cadres, who are all poor and hired laborers, specifically divided labor and set an example when they began to organize winter production, leading the masses to actively produce to make up for the famine. The cadres held meetings to discuss and plan to organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women in the village to participate in production. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village were organized into a production brigade, divided into seven groups. The chairman of the labor union, Wu Kuanyao, led the coal miners, a group of eleven people, earning over 300,000 yuan. Deputy Village Head Zhai Shijiu led a small business trading group of thirteen people, earning over 98,000 yuan. Public Security Officer Wang Jucai led three transportation teams with fifteen livestock, running back and forth between Zanhuang and Xingtai, transporting thirteen times in total (carrying coal, carrying feet), earning over 123,000 yuan. Women's Chairman Wu Lizai led four women's textile groups, with fifteen women participating in spinning, spinning thirty jin of cotton, weaving thirty-two zhang of cloth, earning over 15,000 yuan. The remaining semi-able-bodied laborers were led by Kang Qin to dig and burn coal at the kiln without payment, digging a total of 12,000 jin of coal, which, according to the market price at the time, could save 200,000 yuan. Everyone's enthusiasm for production is very high, and their energy is great. This is because the cadres are poor and hired laborers in power, taking the lead as the backbone, recognizing that winter production is mainly for surviving the famine, with organization and planning, and the cadres are clearly assigned to lead, so the effect is great.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—According to comprehensive reports from various sources: As the Lunar New Year approaches, industries, mines, and businesses in the Chiang area are facing closures, shutdowns, and production cuts under the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime's policy of strangling national industry and commerce. In Nanjing, the heart of the Chiang bandits, more than twenty stores closed down on the 24th due to business difficulties. Earlier this month, another one hundred and eight stores in Changchun closed down. The larger Shoufeng Flour Company in Tianjin, which originally had three factories with a total of sixty-one flour milling machines, used to produce 15,000 bags of flour per day under normal circumstances. Now, only one factory is operating, exclusively grinding corn flour, producing 2,000 bags a day. Other companies, such as Fuxing and Yutai, are operating intermittently. The chemical raw material industry is panicked due to the loss of customers, and the Yongli Chemical Company is anxious about the increasing production cuts. Small and medium-sized industries are facing even more tragic circumstances due to sales prices being lower than costs and stagnant sales. Tianjin originally had fifty-four soap factories, but ten have already closed down, twenty-one have suspended operations, and only twenty-three are barely operating. Almost all thirty-six oil pressing businesses have shut down. Of the fifty-four dyeing factories, which could dye 313,500 bolts of cloth per month when fully operational, now only dye 60,000 bolts per month. Due to the squeezing out of American goods and increased tobacco taxes, the number of cigarette factories in Peiping has decreased from fourteen to three, and these three are also reducing workers and struggling to survive. After the Chiang bandits stopped foreign exchange settlements in December before the new year, the export of Dagu salt has decreased by three-quarters. Originally, about 80,000 dan of salt could be exported each month, but only 20,000 dan were exported last month. Salt farms are also experiencing a decline in production due to insufficient working capital. Industrialists in Peiping and Tianjin all say that the upcoming Lunar New Year will be more difficult than any previous year. They say that last year, those relying on agricultural raw materials for production—such as flour and vegetable oil industries—have mostly closed down, and this year it will be the turn of industries relying on natural raw materials for production—such as cement and alkali production—to close down.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 四大家族绞杀民族工商业  蒋区工厂多倒闭减产\n\n1948-02-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    四大家族绞杀民族工商业\n    蒋区工厂多倒闭减产\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合各方消息：旧历年关行将到来，蒋区工、矿、商业在蒋匪绞杀民族工商业的政策下，纷纷倒闭、停工、减产。蒋匪心脏南京，二十四日有商店二十余家因营业困难倒闭。本月初，长春商店续有一百零八家歇业。津市较大的寿丰面粉公司，原有三个厂，共六十一架磨粉机。平时每天可出粉一万五千袋，现只有一个厂开工专磨玉米面，一天出两千袋。其他如福星、裕泰均时开时停。化学原料工业因失去主顾而恐慌，永利化学公司正为日益减产而焦急。中小工业在售价低于成本、销路停滞下遭遇更为悲惨。天津原有肥皂工厂五十四家，现已倒闭十家，停工二十一家，仅有二十三家勉强开工。榨油业三十六家，几乎全部停业。染厂五十四家，如全部开工每月可染布三十一万三千五百匹，现每月仅染六万匹。由于美货排挤及烟税增加，北平纸烟厂已由十四家减至三家，此三家亦正在缩减工人，苟延残喘。年前十二月蒋匪停止押汇后，大沽盐出口已减少四分之三，原来每月可输出盐八万担左右，上月只出口了两万担。盐场因资金周转不灵，生产亦随之下降。平津的工业家都说行将到来的旧历年关，比过去任何一个年关都难过。他们说，去年靠农产品原料生产——如面粉、植物油业大多已经倒闭，今年将轮到靠天然原料生产——如水泥、制碱的工业倒闭了。"

    "content": "[Taiyue News] At the end of last year, the Yuebei Prefectural Commissioner's Office inspected grain warehouses in various counties and discovered widespread and serious bureaucracy, resulting in significant grain losses and wasted labor. (1) Attention was only paid to procedures, not to storage. As a result, the amount of grain that was underweight and moldy was very large. Ten counties reported writing off over 7,100 *shi* of grain, and there are still 1,000 *shi* of rotten grain that has not been processed. In Pingyao, a single incident in the summer resulted in the loss of 4,000 *jin* of grain. Because the scales were not standardized and the transportation of the grain by laborers was poorly organized, one shipment from Tunliu to Anze lost 60,000 *jin* due to being underweight. Many warehouses were controlled by landlords, unscrupulous merchants, and bad elements, who sabotaged the work from within. For example, Hu Shengyin, the director of the Tianchi Warehouse in Pingyao, was a landlord who took several hundred *jin* of public grain for production. In the Han Zhuang Warehouse in Huoxian, cadres accepted several hundred *jin* of wet grain from landlords, which resulted in the spoilage of two cave dwellings full of wheat, and the government was previously unaware of this. In Zhujialing, Huoxian, there were still 3,000 *jin* of wheat stored, and in Fengcun, there were 4,200 *jin* of wheat stored, which were only discovered during a warehouse cleanup in the autumn. (2) Planning was inadequate, resulting in a great waste of labor. In Pingyao and Lingshi districts, the locations for storing grain were not planned in advance, and several rounds of moving and transporting resulted in the waste of over 10,000 units of labor. At the Yuwu Warehouse in Tunliu, due to a shortage of scales and inability to adjust, laborers who brought grain had to wait two days to deliver it. Laborers from Qinyuan went to Tangcheng, Hecheng, and Beiping in Anze to transport grain and found nothing, resulting in 600 to 700 lost workdays. (3) Preliminary investigations have revealed that various levels have inflated expenses, borrowed grain haphazardly, and hoarded grain, amounting to 40,000 *shi*. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office alone has inflated expenses and borrowed grain haphazardly to the tune of 1,000 *shi* over the years. Qin County borrowed 600 *shi* of public grain, and one district in Qinyuan used public grain to cover 220,000 yuan in expenses, with most counties hoarding grain. A district office in Lingshi recently spoiled 70 *shi* of hoarded grain. (4) The leadership often fails to see many problems or only shouts slogans without immediately thinking of ways to solve them. The underweight grain from Lingshi from previous years has not yet been written off. In Anze in 1944, grain in Matimao was buried for a year, and the Prefectural Commissioner's Office pushed it to the county, and the county pushed it to the Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and no one dealt with it, and the grain rotted more and more. In Anze, when transporting grain to Qinyuan in the summer, the accounts showed a storage of 6,000 *shi*, but the warehouse only actually contained 3,000 *shi*. When problems arose at various levels of government, they only shouted slogans and did not actively think of ways to solve them. This has now attracted attention, and efforts are being made to correct it.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 岳北仓库工作官僚主义严重  烂掉粮食浪费民力  各地都应深入检查\n\n1948-02-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    岳北仓库工作官僚主义严重\n    烂掉粮食浪费民力\n    各地都应深入检查\n    【太岳消息】岳北专署在去年年底，检查各县仓库粮食，发现普遍存在严重的官僚主义，以致损失粮食与浪费民力甚大。（一）只注意手续，不注意保管。因此粮食脱秤霉烂的数目很大。十个县报销处理七千一百多石，还没有处理的烂粮也有一千石。平遥夏天一次即损失粮食四千斤。因为秤不统一，运粮民工又组织的不好，有一次从屯留往安泽运粮，就脱秤六万斤。好多仓库掌握在地主奸商和坏分子手里，从中捣鬼。如平遥天池仓库主任胡生银是个地主，拿了几百斤公粮搞生产。霍县韩庄仓库干部收了地主几百斤湿粮食，结果把两窑洞麦子烂坏了，过去政府就不知道。霍县朱家岭还存放有麦子三千斤，冯村存放麦子四千二百斤，直至秋天清理仓库时才发现。（二）计划不到，浪费很大民力。平遥、灵石区先没把存放粮食的地方计划好，搬来搬去运输几次，浪费民力一万多个。屯留余吾仓库，因秤少，调不开，民工送来粮食得等两天才能交了。沁源民工到安泽唐城、和川、北平运粮扑了空，误工六七百个。（三）各级浮支乱借和打埋伏的粮食，据初步清理，即查出四万石。光专署几年来就浮支乱借了一千石。沁县借出公粮六百石，沁源一区用公粮垫支款二十二万元，大部县份都有埋伏粮。灵石一个区公所最近即烂了埋伏粮七十石。（四）有许多问题，领导上总是看不见，或只是空喊，不马上想办法处理。灵石前几年的脱秤粮，到现在还没有报销。安泽四四年在马蹄凹的粮食，埋了一年，专署推县，县推专署，都不作处理，粮食越烂越多。安泽在夏天往沁源运粮的时候，帐上存粮六千石，仓库实在只存有三千石。各级政府发生了问题，都只是叫喊，没有积极想办法解决，现已引起注意，着手纠正。"

    "content": "Zuoquan First District Holds Meeting of Poor Peasants, Hired Laborers, and Cadres\nCarefully Studies Land Law\nUnderstands it Themselves, Then Publicizes it to the Masses\n\n[Zuoquan News] The First District of Zuoquan County convened a meeting of cadres of poor peasants and hired laborers, and more enlightened poor and hired peasants on the 17th of this month. A total of 103 district and village cadres and 81 peasants participated. The purpose of this meeting was to study the Land Law and review the publicity of the Land Law. According to reports from various villages, when the Land Law was conveyed on the 2nd of this month, due to the short time, only several spirits and the discipline of observing the Land Law were pointed out, as well as the system of collecting mass reflections and reporting. Due to the different ideological understandings of the village cadres, the acceptance was also different, so several different situations arose: More honest cadres, after returning to the village, read and explained it to the masses one by one, convened mass meetings and meetings of various strata, and conducted research and discussion, such as in Liujiazhuang and Xiafenghou villages. The cadres patiently and repeatedly interpreted it to the masses, not only did no problems occur, but also promoted production. Some villages only read it to the masses once and did not explain it further, such as Songjiazhuang and Caojiazai villages, which caused misunderstandings among the masses, who were only afraid of disrupting the equitable distribution. A few village cadres were not honest in publicizing to the masses, but had other purposes, only discussing who to draw from and who not to draw from, disrupting the equal distribution. Even a \"Equal Distribution Committee\" was established. This caused unrest among the masses, who secretly sold grain and indulged in excessive eating and drinking at night, and landlords also took the opportunity to carry out sabotage. According to reports from various places, peasants who had not completely turned themselves over actively supported and endorsed it, saying that this might mean cultivating a good piece of land. A few middle peasants and cadres and activists who had taken too much fruit produced ideas of fear and waiting, such as cadres who had taken too much fruit said: We have taken too much, we will return it, just wait to return it. Some middle peasants asked the cadres when will we struggle? When will we divide the land, and then it will be over.\n\nWhen the meeting reached this point, it turned to examining why these phenomena occurred. The political director of Yinjiazhuang said: When I was publicizing the Land Law Outline, I didn't understand why the landlord should get the same share, so I didn't read that clause. The village chief of Fuyu said: I didn't come to the meeting on the 2nd, and the political director came back and told me to divide the land, and I thought: Usually we say to produce and get rich, but we haven't even raised three cows, and now we are going to divide the land, and you still say to publicize it well, I just didn't understand it.\n\nEveryone looked back and examined themselves, corrected their attitude, and the meeting turned to studying and discussing the Land Law Outline, clause by clause and word by word. Regarding the issue of giving the landlord the same share, some said in the discussion: Giving the landlord the same share should not be written in the Land Law Outline. Regarding the issue of middle peasants, some said: If the landlords are all struggled against, and we want to level out the wealth, where will we make up the difference if not from the middle peasants? The higher authorities said that the middle peasants should not be touched, and that we must see the situation. Everyone argued very heatedly. The leaders then read the administrative office's announcement and the Xinhua Daily editorial on overcoming distortions and misunderstandings, and then divided into groups for research and discussion. At the beginning of the discussion, some people still said that the landlords should be given bad land, and that the middle peasants should not be touched, depending on the situation. Some people had different opinions. The village chief of Houyaoyu said: In the past, I thought it was unreasonable to give the landlord a share, but today, according to the Outline, in order to completely eliminate feudalism, we give the landlord a share, which means we must completely eliminate them economically and make them bow their heads politically. This is the peasants' leniency towards the landlords. Guo Yinxiang of Xiafenghou said: Chairman Mao said to unite 90% of the peasants, if we struggle against the middle peasants, who will dare to rise up? We are eliminating feudalism, not eliminating middle peasants. Through repeated discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that giving the landlord the same share must be conditional on him lowering his head politically and surrendering his weapons economically. The key to not touching the middle peasants is that we are eliminating feudalism, not eliminating wealth. At the same time, the floating wealth of wealthy middle peasants should not be touched, and only land should be drawn through consultation to achieve equitable distribution of land. Everyone also recalled that in the previous period, landlords took advantage of loopholes, and some peasants were wasteful, which was all detrimental to us. This time, when we go back, we should honestly publicize to the peasants, and our cadres should resolutely withdraw the excess fruit they have taken.\n\nEveryone set out a publicity plan. Some people suggested: When we go back, we should focus on the poor and hired laborers in publicizing the Land Law Outline, and unite the middle peasants. In terms of method, we should take a persuasive attitude towards the middle peasants, explaining that wasting is our own blood and sweat, and that we peasants are one family. For those who have taken too much fruit, we should explain that they should honestly return the excess fruit and concentrate on production. To the landlords and saboteurs, we should give strict warnings, telling them to lower their heads and not sabotage, otherwise they will be subject to public trial by the people. Everyone said: We must patiently and repeatedly explain to the peasants, so that every peasant understands and turns to production. We should use the publicity of the Land Law Outline to inspect production, and use production achievements to measure the publicity of the Land Law Outline.\n\n(Zuoquan County First District Communications Group, Qinghua, Sailong)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 左权一区开贫雇干部农民会  细心研究土地法  自己弄通了，再向群众宣传\n左权县第一区通讯组  庆华  赛龙\n1948-02-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    左权一区开贫雇干部农民会\n    细心研究土地法\n    自己弄通了，再向群众宣传\n    【左权消息】左权一区在本月十七号召开雇贫干部与觉悟较高的雇贫农民会议，参加区村干部共一百零三人，农民八十一人。这个会的目的是学习土地法，检讨宣传土地法的情形。根据各村汇报看来，本月二日传达土地法时，因时间短，只是指出了几种精神与遵守土地法的纪律，和收集群众反映与汇报制度，由于村干部的思想认识不同，接受上也不同，所以产生几种不同的情况：比较老实的干部，回村后一一的向群众宣读与解释，召开了群众大会与各阶层会议，进行研究讨论，如刘家庄、下丰堠等村，干部耐心反复的向群众解读，不但未发生问题，而且推进了生产。有些村只向群众宣读一次，再不解释，如宋家庄、曹家寨等村，引起了群众误解，光怕打乱平分。有个别村干部不老实向群众宣传，反另有目的，光讨论抽谁不抽谁，打乱均分。甚至成立了平分委员会。引起了群众不安，偷着卖粮食，黑夜偷着大吃大喝，地主也来乘机钻空子进行破坏。根据各地反映，未翻透身的农民积极赞成拥护，说这可能种一块好地了。少数中农与多占果实的干部、积极分子产生了怕和等的思想，如多占果实的干部说：咱多占啦，退就退吧，等着退。有些中农问干部啥时斗呀？啥时平分了，就过去了。\n    会议开到这里，转入检查为什么发生了这些现象，殷家庄政治主任说：我在宣传土地法大纲时，给地主同样分一份我思想不通，就没念那一条。扶峪村长说：我二号没来开会，政治主任回来和我说平分呀，我想：平常说叫生产发财呀，还没有闹下三个牛，就来平分，还说叫好好宣传，我就没有闹通。\n    每个人都回头检查了自己，端正了态度，会议转向了对土地法大纲逐条逐字的研究讨论。给地主同样分一份的问题，在讨论中有的说：给地主同样分一份，不应写在土地法大纲上。对中农问题，有的说：地主斗光了，抽肥补瘦，不向中农抽去哪里补？上级说中农不动，还有个看情况。大家争论很热烈。领导上这时宣读了行署的布告，和新华日报克服曲解与误解的社论，又分小组研究讨论。在开始讨论中，还有人说给地主分是分坏田，对中农不动看情况走。有人意见不一样，后窑峪村长说：过去我认为给地主分说不通，今天根据大纲，在彻底消灭封建的情况下，才给地主分一份，也就是在经济上必须彻底消灭，政治上必须低头，这是农民对地主的宽大。下丰堠郭银祥说：毛主席说团结百分之九十农民，咱要斗了中农，谁还敢往起闹？咱是消灭封建，不是消灭中农。这样反复讨论中，大家一致认为对地主同样分一份，一定要他在政治上低了头，经济上缴了械。中农不动，主要是咱消灭封建，不是消灭财富。同时富裕中农浮财不动，只是土地用协商方法抽些，也是为了达到土地平分。大家又回忆到前一段地主钻空子，有些农民浪费，这都对咱们不利，这次回去，应老老实实向农民宣传，咱干部多占果实，应坚决的退出。\n    大家都订出了宣传计划，有人提出：回去在方向上以贫雇为主宣传土地法大纲，并团结中农。在方式上，对中农以劝告态度，说明浪费了是自己的血汗，我们农民是一家。对多占果实的人，说明多占果实应老实的退出来，安心的搞生产。对地主破坏分子，严格的警告，叫他们低头，不能破坏，否则要受人民的公审。大家都表示：要耐心反复的向农民解释，使的每个农民都了解了，走向生产。以宣传土地法大纲来检查生产，以生产成绩来测量土地法大纲的宣传。\n          （左权县第一区通讯组、庆华、赛龙）"

They demanded its immediate cancellation and called on all college students in the Chiang-controlled areas to \"rise up together to fight for the right to self-government, to crush all attempts to enslave the youth, and to fight to defend the universities and human rights.\" The statement also denounced: \"These rules show the (Chiang bandit) education authorities' new intention to further implement the enslavement education, marking a new stage of enslavement education,\" \"Negatively, it attempts to restrict students' activities inside and outside the school, cut off the connection between youth students in schools, districts, and internationally, and isolate the exchange of feelings among young students.\" \"Positively, it attempts to enable (Chiang party) training and management personnel to directly or indirectly manipulate and control the student unions,\" \"to make young students into puppets that (Chiang bandits) authorities can manipulate freely, so as to achieve their goal of enslaving the youth.\" The statement firmly stated: \"Autonomy is our basic right and will never be subject to any unreasonable restrictions.\" It demanded that the Chiang bandit's Ministry of Education \"withdraw its order,\" otherwise it \"will not accept it.\" At the same time, starting on December 26th, students at Nanjing Central University held a strike to protest the Chiang bandit's suppression of the student union's departmental representative conference activities and the expulsion of eight students. Despite the Chiang bandit's obstruction, they continued to hold student union elections and persisted in the strike until December 30th. This was the second strike by the school's students to resist the Chiang Party's oppression of student unions, the first being on November 26th of last year. It is reported that the Chiang bandit education authorities, shocked by the patriotic student movement in the Chiang-controlled areas last year, promulgated the so-called \"Revised Rules for Student Unions in Secondary and Higher Education Institutions\" to further suppress students. These \"rules\" stipulate that \"the organization of student unions should be handled by the school's training department or teaching department, which should designate two to three students from each grade or department to first establish a preparatory committee,\" \"The school principal and the person in charge of training shall be responsible for directing and supervising,\" and the Chiang bandit school authorities have the right to order the \"removal\" of student union directors elected by students at will, and even \"dissolve\" the student union.

To overcome the above two biases, reading groups should be organized in every village, and the Outline Land Law must be known to men and women, young and old, in order to thoroughly implement equal distribution.\n            (San Qing, Han San, Si Ming)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 应克服不向中农、妇女宣传土地法的偏向\n三清  汉三  思明\n1948-02-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    应克服不向中农、妇女宣传土地法的偏向\n    【涉县消息】涉县一区神头联合学区，开会总结宣传土地法大纲的经验与办法。江家庄教员冯火成说：“报上登出来土地法大纲，我首先向贫雇读了好几遍，可是没敢向中农读。我怕给中农读了，他心上一不安，生产非受影响不可。”神头教员申思明说：“我看你这样宣传是一个偏向。”他自己是给贫雇读了，一条一条的讨论，同时还组织读报小组，研究通达了，再到冬学给中贫农共同读，这样就能防止地主、富农故意曲解土地法大纲。杨家山教员姚青全说：“我的宣传方式方法和神头差不多，就是没给妇女读过。”前宽嶂教员姚汉英说：“我也没有向妇女读，我怕她们懂不清。”大家都说：这也是一种偏向。要克服以上两种偏向，要在村村组织读报组，真正要把土地法大纲叫男女老少都知道了，才能彻底的实行平分。\n            （三清、汉三、思明）"

The communique stated that a unit of our army north of the Daqing River continuously swept the bandit puppet Wang Fenggang's forces from the 18th to the 21st of last month, liberating the two cities of Xiong and Ba, and many important strongholds and villages such as Nanmeng, Niutuo, Mao'erwan, Wangkeqiao, Jiugang, Shakou, Banjiawo, Duliu, Chaheji, Mawutou, Gegezhuang, Longwan, Xihouliu, and Mazhuang. So far, all transportation and fortifications in the Xiongxian, Baxian, and Xinzhen areas north of the Daqing River have been destroyed. A total of the entire Second Battalion and most of the Third Battalion of Wang Fenggang's 15th Regiment, one company of the First Battalion, and all of the Second Company of the puppet police force were annihilated. More than 150 bandits and puppets, including the Deputy Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion of the 15th Regiment, were killed or wounded, and 521 people were captured, including the Deputy Battalion Commander of the Second Battalion, Mao Pinglin, the Company Commander Yang Kemin and others. The captured included 20 light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, 349 rifles and pistols, four grenade launchers, and many other military supplies. Wang Fenggang was originally a major Chinese traitor in Xincheng County, Hebei Province, serving as a pawn of the Japanese invaders and massacring thousands of people, whom the people hated to the bone. After the Japanese surrender, Chiang bandit incorporated him into the Seventh Security Brigade of Hebei. After Fu bandit entered Hebei, he expanded Wang bandit's two regiments into six regiments, distributing them north of the Daqing River to build fortifications. After this blow, Wang bandit's plan to control the Xiong (county), Ba (county), and Xin (cheng) areas was bankrupted.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Front, 31st: The Front Headquarters has issued a supplementary communique stating that in the battles of Zhuangtuan and other places east of Laishui on the 13th of this month, in addition to annihilating most of the New 32nd Division and parts of the 101st Division and the Provisional 17th Division, and killing Li Mingding, the commander of the New 32nd Division, the headquarters of the Fu bandit's 35th Army was also dealt a devastating blow. The commander of the army, Lu Yinglin, was also killed while breaking through in Beiyian. Further investigation has revealed that Hao Yingwu, the Colonel of the Military Affairs Department of the army headquarters, Liu Jinru, the Colonel of the Medical Department, Li Shuzhen, the Major Operations Staff Officer, and Li Shutong, the Major Grenade Launcher Company Commander, and other officers were captured alive. Lu Yinglin was from Yuanqu, Shanxi, a student of the fifth class of the Baoding Military Academy and the second class of the Army University's special course. He had served as a brigade commander, division commander, deputy military law supervisor in the Jin army, and chief of staff of the Fu bandit's 12th War Zone, and later as commander of the bandit's 35th Army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 扫荡大清河北匪伪据点战果  共歼王逆凤岗部六百多  涞水之战打死傅匪军长鲁英麟\n\n1948-02-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    扫荡大清河北匪伪据点战果\n    共歼王逆凤岗部六百多\n    涞水之战打死傅匪军长鲁英麟\n    【新华社晋察冀前线一日电】前线司令部顷发表第八号作战公报公布大清河北战果称：大清河北我军一部自上月十八日至二十一日连续扫荡匪伪王凤岗部，解放雄、霸两城，及重要据点南孟、牛驼、毛尔湾、王克桥、咎岗、沙口、板家窝、独流、岔河集、马务头、葛各庄、龙湾、西侯留、马庄等村镇多处。至此大清河北雄县、霸县、新镇地区所有交通、堡垒全被摧毁，计歼匪伪王凤岗十五团二营全部、三营大部、一营一个连、伪保警队二中队全部，毙伤伪十五团三营副营长以下一百五十余，俘二营副营长毛平林、连长杨克敏以下五百二十一名，缴获轻机枪二十挺、六○炮一门、长短枪三百四十九支、掷弹筒四个、及其他军用品甚多。按匪伪王凤岗原系河北新城县大汉奸，充当日寇爪牙，屠杀人民数千以上，人民恨之入骨，日寇投降后，蒋匪收编为河北保安第七总队。傅匪进入河北后，更把王匪两个团扩为六个团，分布在大清河北修筑工事，经此次打击，王匪控制雄（县）霸（县）新（城）地区之计划，遂告破产。\n    【新华社晋察冀前线三十一日电】前线司令部顷发表补充公报称：本月十三日涞水以东庄疃等战斗中，除歼灭新三十二师大部，一○一师、暂十七师各一部，击毙新三十二师师长李铭鼎外，并予傅匪三十五军军部以歼灭性打击。该军军长鲁英麟于北义安突围时亦被击毙。另已查明者，计生俘该军军部上校军务处长郝颖五、上校军医处长刘金如、少校作战参谋李恕贞、少校榴弹炮连长李树彤等以下官员多名。按鲁英麟为山西垣曲人，保定军校五期和陆大专科二期学生，在晋军中曾任旅长、师长、军法副监及傅匪十二战区参谋长等职，后任匪三十五军军长。"

    "content": "Xinhua General Branch Reporter's Commentary:\nMilitary Region Forces Rapidly Grow and Strengthen - 58,000+ Chiang Bandits Annihilated in Five Months\n\n[This dispatch] reports: After the southward expedition of the Liu-Deng and Chen-Xie armies, the military region forces of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area independently undertook the glorious task of clearing out the remaining enemy within the inner lines. From August to the end of the year last year, a total of more than 58,000 enemies were annihilated, and they greatly tempered and developed themselves, becoming a powerful force for the counter-offensive. The reporter pointed out: This matter is of extremely great significance, fully demonstrating that the strength of the people's army is infinite and grows extraordinarily rapidly. The reporter continued: Some comrades lacked a correct assessment of the counter-offensive situation and the changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves. They neither recognized that although there were still nearly 200,000 enemies around our area, they were all remnants and defeated soldiers, trapped in the peripheral points and lines, and had fallen into a purely defensive posture. Nor did they recognize that these Chiang bandits would inevitably make desperate and frenzied struggles when they were dying, and would never be willing to die themselves. These comrades were satisfied with the status quo, so they relaxed and became 麻痹, even content with ease and comfort, and did not give a strong rebuff to the Chiang bandits' mischief. The number of enemies annihilated in August, September, and October was only 20,000, with more than 6,000 in August, more than 9,000 in September, and more than 5,000 in October. The Central Bureau and the Military Region promptly and clearly pointed out that correctly understanding the situation as favorable to us, actively attacking the enemy, and building and cultivating the main force corps are the basic links to winning victory. Since then, all border areas have resolutely implemented the principle of \"the enemy advances, we advance,\" continuing to vigorously carry out guerrilla warfare, and appropriately concentrating forces, focusing on and planning to organize campaigns and battles, and annihilating and eliminating the enemy's remaining strongholds one by one. The number of enemies annihilated in November increased to more than 11,000, and in December it increased again to more than 27,000, which was 7,000 more than the total number in August, September, and October, winning three consecutive victories in Dongping, Changyuan, and Yuncheng. Especially in the Battle of Yuncheng, the solid fortifications built by the Japanese invaders and renovated by the Chiang bandits were captured, and more than 10,000 enemies were annihilated in one fell swoop. This proves that the combat effectiveness of our inner-line corps has been greatly improved, and it can not only annihilate the enemy's vital forces in field battles, but also eliminate strong strongholds. Even if the Chiang bandits shrink into tortoise shells, they cannot escape the fate of death. The reporter concluded: The current large-scale military training movement in the entire region has achieved remarkable results. An even heavier iron fist will smash the remaining Chiang bandit strongholds one by one until they are completely eliminated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新华总分社记者评论：军区部队力量迅速生长壮大  五个月歼蒋匪五万八千余人\n\n1948-02-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    新华总分社记者评论：\n    军区部队力量迅速生长壮大  五个月歼蒋匪五万八千余人\n    【本报消息】新华总分社记者评述：晋冀鲁豫区军区部队，在刘邓、陈谢大军南征以后，独立担负肃清内线残敌的光荣任务。自去年八月至年底五个月，共歼敌五万八千余人，并大大锻炼与发展了自己，成为一支强大的反攻劲旅。记者指出：此事意义极为重大，充分显示人民军队的力量无穷无尽，而且生长异常迅速。记者继称：曾经有若干同志，对反攻形势及敌我力量变化缺乏正确估计，既不认识我区周围，虽尚有将近二十万敌人，但均系残兵败将，困守边沿点线，已陷入单纯防御的态势。更不认识这些蒋匪垂死时，必作绝望的疯狂的挣扎，决不肯自己死亡。这些同志满于现状，因此就松懈麻痹，甚至苟且偷安，没有给蒋匪的蠢动以有力的回击。八、九、十三个月歼敌数字仅两万人，计八月份六千余人，九月份九千余人，十月份五千余人。中央局、军区及时明确指出：正确认识形势对我有利，主动积极的进攻敌人，建设培养主力兵团，三者是争取胜利的基本环节。自此各边沿地区均坚决实行敌进我进继续猛烈开展游击战争，并适当集结兵力，有重点、有计划的组织战役战斗，各个歼灭拔除敌人的残留据点。十一月份歼敌数增至一万一千余人，十二月份再增至二万七千余人，比八、九、十三个月总数还多七千，连获东平、长垣、运城三捷。尤其是运城之战，攻克日寇建筑、蒋匪增修的坚固工事，一次歼敌万余。证明我内线兵团战斗力已大大提高，不仅能够在野战中歼灭敌人有生力量，而且能够拔除强固的据点。蒋匪即使缩在乌龟壳里，也逃不脱死亡的命运。记者末称：现全区部队大练兵运动已获显著成绩，更沉重的铁拳，即将一个一个把残留的蒋匪据点敲得粉碎，直到全部肃清为止。"

    "content": "Political Director of Imperial Examinations Actually Forbids Poor and Hired Peasants from Buying Shares.\n    [Taihang News] Comprehensive report from correspondents in Lucheng and other counties: Recently, during winter production, some village cadres not only did not lead production well, but also stood on the heads of the masses and shat and pissed on them. Hired and poor peasants suffered even greater oppression, and they urgently demanded that these stones be removed.\n    One type of cadre is openly corrupt and wasteful. The political director of Wanglibao in Lucheng \"mobilized\" twenty people to \"help\" his brother get married for three days. These families had fifteen idle livestock and carts that could not be used for production. In addition, thirty relatives, men and women, \"helped\" for two days, also causing work delays. In total, in addition to his family’s \"entertainment\" waste of 133,000 yuan, he also wasted 120 man-days and 45 animal-days of the masses, losing 195,000 yuan. Even more unreasonable, he forced the masses to give \"gifts\" of 75,000 yuan. After the leadership discovered this, they sent Comrade Shen to the village to deal with it. Comrade Shen first sided with the masses, encouraging them to bravely speak out their grievances. Ren Fuwen, a \"turned-over\" household, said: \"I didn't have money, so I had to borrow 500 yuan to give as a gift.\" Liu Liuchang and many other people said: \"If we say we don't want to help with the wedding or give gifts, we're afraid they'll give us a hard time.\" Some said: \"When ordinary people get married, the political director doesn't allow them to ride in a sedan chair, but when his brother got married, he even borrowed a sedan chair from another village.\" After the masses complained, Comrade Shen went to \"get through\" to the political director. In the end, the political director \"reviewed\" himself to everyone, saying: \"It's too late to regret it, everyone should just suffer a bit, I will reform in the future.\" In this way, he deceived everyone, and the problem was \"solved.\" Cadres in Xixiazhuang in the Second District of Xiuwu County secretly fabricated a list of hired and poor peasants, stamped their own fingerprints on it, and fraudulently obtained loans from the bank. They then returned and jointly engaged in speculative trading to make big money. The hired and poor peasants in the village had no food or drink, and wanted to produce but had no capital. They didn't care about them at all. Old peasant Wang Lao Han, with a family of seven, harvested 1.9 dan of corn last year. After repaying 0.4 dan of debt, the remaining grain was already eaten up. He wanted to engage in production, but couldn't do it without funds. The Keju Cooperative in Heshun County was established before last autumn. There were a total of three cadres, who only ate and didn't work. The political director, who was also the director of the cooperative, disliked delaying his work, so he found a landlord to replace him for a long time. Because hired and poor peasants had more shares in the cooperative than middle peasants, he encouraged middle peasants to buy more shares while restricting hired and poor peasants from buying shares. For every 10,000 yuan of shares, they would distribute dividends based on 5,000 yuan, or return 5,000 yuan. The money earned had to be split three-seven with them (referring to the cooperative cadres). This time, the three of them divided 150,000 yuan in dividends. The money borrowed from the bank was not distributed to the poor and hired peasants, but was used to buy two donkeys and place them in the cooperative for their use. He didn't find ways for the poor and hired peasants to produce, but instead arranged for four landlords to go out and produce. The hired and poor peasants had no place to complain, and only reflected in secret: \"The village chief doesn't care about us, but he should be replaced (referring to the political director)!\"\n    Another type of cadre says they are for the hired and poor peasants, but secretly oppress them. Some bad cadres in Lijiayao in the Sixth District of Licheng County are doing their utmost to suppress the hired and poor peasant groups. Jiang Wenchang, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, said, \"I must serve the hired and poor peasants in every way,\" but when the hired and poor peasant group passed a motion to lend Cao Quanlin, who had no clothes or quilts, 10,000 yuan, he stopped it. Later, the village chief found out and firmly decided to lend it to Quanlin. Jiang Fusuo, the deputy director of the Armed Forces Committee, didn't participate in production at all during the entire winter, only allowing the mutual aid group to allocate work points to him and receive wages in name only, but when it came time to settle accounts, he only gave him an IOU.\n    Rich Peasant Becomes Manager, Moves His Entire Family into the Cooperative\n    Yet another situation is where landlord and rich peasant elements have wormed their way in as cadres and continue to exploit the masses in disguised ways. In the Dongnao Cooperative in the Third District of Yushe County, the five cadres, including the director, deputy director, and accountant, are all rich peasants. The director, Zhang Sihuo, simply moved his wife and children into the cooperative to live, eating and drinking well every day with vermicelli and white flour. Needless to say, he didn't engage in business, but even drinking water and eating biscuits were served by the mill workers. Whenever he was idle, he went to the village to engage in corruption. The masses were extremely angry when they saw this, and raised some objections, but he scolded them in the people's school, saying, \"This is a rumor spread by spies.\" After that, the masses didn't dare to say anything, but only said in secret: \"How dare we provoke him? The village chief is also one of his people.\" To this day, the 180,000 yuan in shares invested by the masses, and the 130,000 yuan in dividends earned, have all been eaten and drunk up by Zhang Sihuo and others, and after adding in embezzlement, they have exploited everything clean. In the Dongjie Cooperative in the First District of Lucheng County, the landlord Lian Duoluo became the person in charge. The cadres always said he was an \"enlightened\" landlord, and he was never struggled against. The landlord Lian Duoluo controlled the cooperative for several months, holding 300,000 yuan in shares from the masses, without accounting or distributing dividends, secretly eating, drinking, embezzling, and wasting, while openly claiming to be losing money. Of course, there was no talk of supporting poor and hired peasants in production! The poor and hired peasants reflected: \"We are short of capital for production, but the shares we invested are all supporting the landlords. We must squeeze them out!\" In Yangjiaxigou in the Ninth District of Linxian County, the landlord Yang Yuqing is the finance and grain secretary. Not only does he not work a single day, but he also gets the equivalent of a war support worker, and has so far exploited the masses for 85 jin of millet. The logistics secretary, Yang Migui (a landlord), is the same as Yang Yuqing, exploiting the masses for 21 jin of war support rice. The hired and poor peasants are very dissatisfied and say: \"We sweat and suffer, while they get rice just by sitting there.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 潞城等县坏干部压迫农民  冬季生产没法闹\n\n1948-02-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    潞城等县坏干部压迫农民\n    冬季生产没法闹\n    科举政治主任，竟不叫贫雇入股。\n    【太行消息】综合潞城等县通讯员来稿：最近在冬季生产中，有部分村干部不但不好好领导生产，还是站在群众头上屙屎撒尿。雇贫农民受压迫更厉害，他们急迫要求搬掉这些石头。\n    有一种干部是公开的贪污浪费。潞城王里堡政治主任给他兄弟结婚，一共“动员”了二十个群众“帮忙”三天，这些群众家里却闲着十五头牲口和大车不能生产；另有四乡亲戚男女三十人“帮忙”，也误工两天；总共除他家“请客”浪费折洋十三万三千元外，还浪费了群众一百二十个人工，四十五个畜工，少赚洋十九万五千元；更无理的是硬让群众上了“礼钱”七万五千元。领导上事后发现了，派干部申同志到该村处理。申同志先给群众作主，让大胆诉苦。“翻身”户任富文说：“我没钱，只好借了五百元给人家上礼”。刘六昌等好多群众说：“咱说不给人家帮忙上礼吧，又怕人家给咱个不好看”。有的说：“老百姓结婚，政治主任不让坐轿，人家兄弟结婚，还到外村借轿坐。”群众诉苦后，申同志又去“打通”政治主任思想。最后，政治主任对大家“检讨”说：“后悔也赶不上啦，大家都吃点亏吧，今后我改造。”就这样欺骗了一顿，就算把问题“解决”了。修武二区西下庄干部，私下假造雇贫名单，自己盖上手印，到银行骗上贷款，回来合伙作投机买卖，赚大钱。村里的雇贫没吃喝，想生产没本钱，他们根本不管。老贫农王老汉，家里七口人，去年收了一石九斗玉茭，除还外帐四斗，余粮早已吃完，心想搞生产，没款不能干。和顺科举合作社是去年秋前成立的，一共三个干部，光吃不动。政治主任兼合作社社长，嫌误工，还找了一个地主给他长期顶工。因为雇贫在合作社入股比中农多，他就一面发动中农多入股，一面限制雇贫入股；入一万元股金的，按五千元分红，或给退回五千元。赚的钱还得和他们（指合作社干部）三七分红。这一次他三个人就分红十五万元。银行贷下的款，也不给贫雇分配，买了两头驴放在合作社，供他们使用。他不给贫雇找生产门路，却给四个地主安排出去生产。雇贫想到硝房干活，他不让，却吸收了地主。雇贫农有苦没处诉，只是背地反映：“村长也不管咱，可该撤换他（指政治主任）啦！”\n    另有一种干部是嘴上说为雇贫，暗地却还压迫雇贫。黎城六区栗家窑有些坏干部，极力压制雇贫小组。农会常委江文昌，口里说“我处处都要为雇贫服务”，可是雇贫小组通过要给现在没穿没盖的曹全林贷一万元款，他就阻止不让；后来村长知道，才坚决作主，贷给了全林。武委会副主任江富锁，自己一冬天根本不参加生产，只让互助组给他拨工受，嘴说出工资，到结帐时只给打了个欠条。\n    富农当了经理，把全家搬到合作社\n    再有一种是地主富农分子，钻进来当了干部，继续变相的剥削群众。榆社三区东瑙合作社，正副经理会计等五个干部都是富农。正经理张四货干脆就把老婆孩子都搬到合作社住，每天粉条、白面等好吃好喝，不用说搞营业，喝水、吃饼干都是磨房工人伺候，一闲下就到村里搞腐化。群众看着恨的不行，提了些意见，反被他在民校骂了一顿，说：“这是特务造谣”。以后群众再也不敢吭啦，只是暗地说：“咱敢惹？村长也是人家的人。”至今群众入的十八万元股金，和赚的十三万元红利，都叫张四货等大吃二喝，加上贪污，剥削了个净光。潞城一区东街合作社，地主连多禄当了掌权，干部一直说他是“开明”地主，根本就没让斗过。地主连多禄掌握合作社好几个月，拿着群众三十万元股金，也不算帐分红，暗地吃喝贪污浪费，明面一直喊叫赔钱，当然更谈不上扶助贫雇生产啦！贫雇双全反映说：“咱生产缺本钱，可是入上股都养活了地主，非挤出不行！”林县九区杨家西沟，地主杨玉清当的是财粮书记，一天不动不用说，还顶一个战勤工，至今已剥削了群众小米八十五斤。后勤书记杨米贵（地主）也和杨玉清一样，剥削了群众二十一斤战勤米。雇贫农民非常不满的说：“咱流汗受罪，人家是坐着得米”。"

    "content": "[Taihang News] In Shentou Village, Shexian First District, after correcting the erroneous practice of cadres giving empty shares to hired and poor peasants, poor and middle peasants united closely for production. On the 3rd of this month, Village Chief Feng Qigui and Farmers' Association Director Qian Yueyi (also a mutual aid team leader) attended a production inspection meeting in the district. After discussion, they realized: \"Allowing middle peasants to give empty shares to hired and poor peasants harms the interests of middle peasants and isolates the poor and hired peasants, which is detrimental to the poor and hired.\" They conducted self-criticism and accepted criticism. After returning to the village, they convened a meeting of cadres above the level of mutual aid team leader on the 4th to discuss corrective measures. First, Village Chief Feng Qigui made a self-criticism, saying: \"Our village's emphasis on helping hired and poor peasants develop sideline occupations during this winter's major production campaign was correct, but because the cooperative, credit cooperative, and small mutual aid societies were not sufficiently connected, we failed to solve the problem of capital difficulties for hired and poor peasants to engage in sideline occupations, resulting in an emphasis on middle peasants helping hired and poor peasants enter empty shares, which affected everyone's production.\" After he finished speaking, everyone unanimously proposed to change course. Then, Qian Yueyi said: \"Correcting empty shares is correct, but what should hired and poor peasants do if they don't have capital to engage in sideline occupations?\" Cooperative Director He Xiting said: \"There is a way, borrow from our credit cooperative.\" After the cadres unified their opinions, they decided to convene a hired and poor peasant meeting. At the hired and poor peasant discussion meeting, Feng Laiting said: \"We and the middle peasants are one family. In the old society, we were all exploited and oppressed by landlords and rich peasants. Now it is very unreasonable for us to use empty shares to exploit them (referring to middle peasants). The main thing is to rely on our own production.\" Feng Zijing also said: \"Relying solely on middle peasant help is not enough. I can sell 12,000 yuan worth of firewood in twenty days.\" Everyone said \"Yes!\" and proposed to borrow from the credit cooperative. When the middle peasants heard that the hired and poor peasants wanted to return the \"empty shares,\" they were extremely happy and said: \"This is very reasonable. In the future, we should help the hired and poor peasants find more avenues and unite well to engage in sideline occupations.\" After the change, the credit cooperative called for share subscriptions, and the middle and poor peasants immediately invested 910,000 yuan, plus the money from selling fruit and peppercorns, totaling 1,070,000 yuan, which was divided into four grades and lent to 83 poor peasants. Now the poor and middle peasants are very enthusiastic about engaging in sideline occupations.\n    [Another Item] In Huyucun Village, Shexian First District, when correcting the erroneous practice of \"mobilizing middle peasants to contribute money and labor to take care of hired and poor peasants,\" the cadres did not honestly examine themselves. Only when the leadership decided to change course and make corrections did they convene a hired and poor peasant meeting to discuss the matter, posing two questions. The first was \"Should our production rely on middle peasant assistance or on our own labor?\" The second was \"Are the middle peasants and us one family, and is it appropriate for them to contribute money and labor to help us?\" It took two nights to \"get through\" to the poor peasants' thinking. Everyone said: \"It mainly depends on ourselves. It is not possible to rely solely on others' help without working.\" Later, they discussed it in the winter school jointly run by poor and middle peasants, and the hired and poor peasants expressed that \"We don't want the money and labor that the middle peasants helped us with.\" Middle peasant Chen Baoku said: \"Our help to you (referring to the hired and poor peasants) is sincere. We should produce well in the future, expand our shares, and the middle and poor peasants will have work to do every day, and the hired and poor peasants will not suffer difficulties.\" After this change, the middle peasants' production enthusiasm greatly increased. However, whether the production difficulties of the hired and poor peasants have been specifically resolved is not mentioned in the submission and remains to be investigated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 神头纠正伤害中农的错误  贫雇中农团结生产  村干认识不深应继续检讨\n\n1948-02-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    神头纠正伤害中农的错误\n    贫雇中农团结生产\n    村干认识不深应继续检讨\n    【太行消息】涉县一区神头村，纠正干部给雇贫入空股的错误作法后，贫中农亲密团结生产起来。本月三日，村长冯其贵，农会主任钱月义（也是互助组长）在区上开生产检查会，经过大家讨论，认识到：“让中农给雇贫入空股，既损害了中农利益，又孤立了贫雇，对贫雇是不利的。”他俩进行了检讨，接受了批评。回村后，在四号召开互助组长以上的干部会，讨论纠正办法。先由村长冯其贵检讨说：“咱村今冬大生产，强调扶助雇贫搞副业是对的，可是因为合作社、信用社和互助小型社联系不够，没做到解决雇贫搞副业的股金困难，才造成强调中农帮雇贫入空股，影响了大家生产。”他说罢，大家就一致提出要转湾。接着，钱月义说：“纠正入空股是对的，可是雇贫没有股金搞副业怎么办？”合作社长和喜亭说：“有办法，从咱信用社贷。”干部意见统一后，便决定召开雇贫会。在雇贫讨论会上，冯来亭说：“咱和中农本是一家人，在旧社会都受地主富农的剥削压迫，现在咱又用上空股来剥削他（指中农），是很不合理的。主要应靠自己生产。”冯子敬也说：“光靠中农帮助不行，我割柴二十天，就能卖洋一万二千元。”大家都说“对！”提出要到信用社贷款。中农听说雇贫要退“空股”，高兴极了，都说：“这可很合理，以后咱可应该多帮助雇贫找门路，好好团结搞副业。”转湾后，信用社号召入股，中贫农一下入了九十一万元，加上卖果实花椒钱，共合一百零七万元，一齐分四等贷给了八十三户贫苦农民。现在贫中农搞副业的劲头很大。\n    【又息】涉县一区胡峪村，在纠正“动员中农拿钱和工照顾雇贫”的错误作法时，干部没有老老实实的检讨自己，只是当领导上决定让转湾纠正的时候，才去召开雇贫会讨论，并提出两个问题，头一个是“咱生产靠中农帮助，还是靠自己劳动？”第二个是“中农和咱是一家，他拿出钱和工帮助咱是不是合适”？费了两黑夜的时间去“闹通”贫农的思想，大家说：“主要是靠自己，不劳动只别人帮助也不行。”后来又到贫中农合伙的冬学里讨论，雇贫表示了“中农帮助咱的钱和工不要了”，中农陈保库这样说：“俺帮助你（指雇贫）可是真心，咱今后好好生产，扩大股金，咱中贫农天天有活做，雇贫就不受困难啦。”经过这样转湾后，中农生产情绪大大提高。但雇贫生产困难是否具体解决，来稿却未提及，尚待访查。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Paris dispatch: The French reactionar government announced on the 25th the devaluation of the Franc, changing the exchange rate to approximately 225 Francs to one US dollar (compared to 119 Francs to one US dollar before the devaluation). According to a TASS report, the devaluation of the Franc was entirely dictated by US imperialism. As soon as the news of the Franc devaluation spread, the US State Department immediately \"expressed its heartfelt approval\" on the 27th. However, the reaction in Britain was filled with panic and unease. London insiders generally believe that the Franc devaluation will seriously affect Britain's economic position, create a crisis for the Pound Sterling and British exports, and may force the Pound to devalue. The Sunday Express exclaimed: \"The Franc devaluation will give British exporters a ruthless blow, thereby increasing their difficulties in foreign competition.\" Even the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stafford Cripps, was greatly shocked.\n\nThe Franc devaluation has aroused strong opposition from the French laboring people. The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) Central Bureau issued a special communique on the Franc devaluation on the 28th of last month, denouncing the Schuman government's criminal measures of selling out national interests. It pointed out that the devaluation has caused a new wave of speculation, which will result in soaring prices and further inflation. Communist Party member of Parliament, César, strongly stated during the discussion of the currency bill in the National Assembly on the 28th: \"The Franc devaluation has made the entire situation unbearable.\" César angrily accused the Schuman government of \"surrendering the entire trade to foreign capital.\" Okey, a Communist Party member of Parliament from Seine Province, pointed out: \"The Franc devaluation, manufactured single-handedly by the United States, seriously affects the lives of all laboring people.\" The Franc devaluation has also become the focus of attack at the ongoing National Farmers' Conference. Luo Cher, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, denounced the evils of the Franc devaluation in his report, saying: \"The devaluation will cause a disastrous rise in prices, and we will have to pay twice the current price for imported goods from the United States in the future.\" The French democratic newspapers unanimously condemned on the 28th, saying: \"The monetary reform carried out by the Schuman government is watching Washington, not Paris and the French people.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Paris dispatch: The French Communist Party's L'Humanité recently commented on the Franc devaluation, saying: \"This is a measure taken by the Schuman government in accordance with the instructions of the US State Department, completely in line with Washington's wishes.\" The newspaper pointed out: \"The Franc devaluation will reduce the purchasing power of workers, reduce wages, wipe out the savings of farmers, and bankrupt small businesses.\" The newspaper revealed that the Franc devaluation is a preparation for US imperialism to implement the Marshall Plan, and is also one of the conditions for US \"temporary aid\" to France. Because the result of the Franc devaluation will double the purchasing power of the US dollar, thereby enabling the United States to cheaply purchase French factories.\n\nThe newspaper continued: Following economic surrender always comes political surrender. The \"American Exporter\" magazine published in Paris declared: France needs a leader, and also needs a year or two of compulsory military training, in order to educate the young generation of France to respect order and law. This is not surprising, because this army can replace the expensive US military. The newspaper then warned: \"The Franc devaluation is the destruction of French national independence. From now on, France will not only no longer be independent in industry and military, but also no longer be the master of its own finances. Therefore, the current government has become a complete slave of US imperialism.\" The newspaper also said: \"Political and economic submission to the United States is due to the fact that the pro-American faction in France has willingly cast itself into the net of slavery. They are now destroying the middle class, attacking the proletariat, hoping to lead the country astray, and paving the way for the de Gaulle faction.\" The newspaper concluded forcefully: \"But the unity of the French people, the friendship of workers and peasants, and the alliance of all those who are being attacked by the pro-American faction will prevent the implementation of all such plans dictated by foreign countries.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 28th of last month: A movement to protect national industry from the invasion of US imperialism is unfolding throughout France. Now, committees to protect various French industries are being established everywhere in France. The committee to protect the aircraft and automobile industries has convened a meeting in Paris and resolved to denounce the reactionary authorities for their shameful defense of the US imperialist destruction of the French economy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 舒曼听命美帝实行法郎贬值  法劳动人民强烈反对  全法展开保护民族工业运动\n\n1948-02-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    舒曼听命美帝实行法郎贬值\n    法劳动人民强烈反对\n    全法展开保护民族工业运动\n    【新华社陕北一日电】巴黎讯：法国反动政府于二十五日宣布实行法郎贬值，将法郎的外汇率改为约二百廿五个法郎换一个美元（按贬值前为一百十九个法郎换一个美元），法郎的国内价格则为约一百八十个法郎换一个美元。据塔斯社报导：法郎的贬值，完全由美帝国主义在发号施令。当法郎贬值消息刚一传出，美国务院即于二十七日“表示衷心赞同”。但英国的反映却充满着惊慌和不安。伦敦一般人士认为法郎贬值将严重影响英国的经济地位，造成对英镑和英国出口的危机，并可能迫使英镑贬值。星期快讯报惊呼：“法郎贬值将给英国出口商以无情打击，从而更增加它们在对外竞争方面的困难”。甚至连英财政大臣克利浦斯，亦大表震惊。法郎贬值引起了法国劳动人民的强烈反对。法总工会中央局于上月二十八日发表关于法郎贬值的特别公报，痛斥舒曼政府出卖国家利益的罪恶措施。并指出：贬值引起了投机的新浪潮，结果将招来物价的飞涨，并使通货愈加膨胀。法共议员赛萨二十八日在国民议会讨论通货问题法案时力称：“法郎贬值已使整个形势不能忍受”。赛氏怒责舒曼政府“已将整个贸易投降于外国资本”。赛纳省法共议员奥奎指出：“美国一手制造出来的法郎贬值，严重影响全体劳动人民的生活”。法郎贬值亦成为正在举行的全国农民会议的攻击中心。法共中委罗雪尔在报告中指斥法郎贬值的恶果称：“贬值将引起物价的灾难性上涨，我们将来必须以两倍于目前的价格，去支付美国进口的商品”。法国各民主报纸于二十八日一致谴责说：“舒曼政府进行的货币改革，眼睛是注视着华盛顿，绝不是看着巴黎与法国人民的。”\n    【新华社陕北一日电】巴黎讯：法共人道报顷评论法郎贬值称：“这是舒曼政府遵照美国务院的吩咐，完全适合于华盛顿方面的愿望”的一种措施。该报指出：“法郎贬值将使工人的购买力降低，薪资减少，将农民的储蓄一扫而光，使小商人陷于破产”。该报揭露：法郎贬值是美帝国主义实行马歇尔计划的准备工作，也是美国对法“临时援助”的条件之一。因为法郎贬值的结果，使美元的购买力增加了一倍，从而使美国将能廉价购置法国的工厂。该报继称：继经济屈服以俱来的，总是政治的屈服，美国在巴黎出版的“进出口杂志”宣称：法国需要一个领袖，并且还需要一年或两年的强迫军训，以便教育法国年青的一代尊重秩序和法律。这是毫不足惊异的，因为这支军队可以代替花钱很多的美军。该报继即警告说：“法郎贬值是法国民族独立的毁灭。从此以后，法国不仅在工业和军队方面不再是独立的了，而且也不再是它自己财政的主人了。因此，目前的政府，已成为美帝国主义的十足奴隶”。该报又说：“政治和经济上对美的屈服都是由于法国亲美派自投奴役之罗网，他们正出而毁灭中产阶级，打击无产阶级，希望使国家走入歧途；并为戴高乐派铺平道路”。该报结语力称：“但是法国人民的团结，工农的友谊，以及一切正蒙受亲美派打击的人们的联盟，将阻止听命国外而定出的一切这类计划之实行”。\n    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社巴黎上月二十八日讯：保护民族工业免遭美帝国主义侵略的运动，正在全法展开。现在法国到处纷纷成立保护法兰西各种工业的委员会，保护飞机及汽车工业委员会已在巴黎召开会议，并决议痛斥反动当局为美帝摧毁法国经济所作的可耻辩护。"

As a result, it will inevitably lower the living standards of the European people and turn Europe into a colony of the United States.

At that time, the workers' wages were set at 200 yuan per day, which was genuinely insufficient. The workers raised the issue of family financial difficulties and requested a profit sharing arrangement of 60% for the capital and 40% for the workers, but this did not materialize. In December, they again requested a profit sharing arrangement of 70% for the capital and 30% for the workers, with the factory providing meals and the workers not receiving travel allowances. Currently, the workers have achieved this goal, and their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. Everyone has established production plans. Previously, a ream of paper weighed 2.4 catties. Now, each ream weighs 2 catties, saving 0.4 catties of raw materials per ream.

    "content": "Starting from the Urgent Demands of the Poor and Hired Laborers\n    Organize to Distribute Grain and Wealth\n    Experiences of Our XX Column in Western Henan in Mobilizing the Masses in New Areas\n    [Our Newspaper's News] Our Field Army's XX Column, fighting and moving in western Henan, mobilized the masses while engaging in combat. From the highest leaders to the cooks and animal tenders, everyone actively participated. By the end of last October, according to incomplete statistics, three brigades and four units directly under the column had mobilized more than 27,000 people in 149 villages and one county town, distributing over 310,000 jin of grain, more than 3,000 mu of land, and a large amount of ill-gotten wealth. Agricultural associations were established in 21 villages, and poor peasant groups were established in 26 villages. Model figures such as Li Zonglin and Tian Peiqin emerged in mobilizing the masses, greatly strengthening the relationship between the army and the people. This quickly raised the class consciousness of the masses in the new areas, who voluntarily acted as guides for the People's Liberation Army, organized stretcher teams, and transported ammunition. This situation, in turn, greatly encouraged and educated the troops, making the commanders and fighters more confident, more consciously abide by mass discipline, more courageous in combat, and more active in mobilizing the masses. This is a major political victory, equal in significance to military victory.\n    In mobilizing the masses, the column has two approaches: one is to find poor and hired peasants and start from their urgent demands. If the poor and hired peasants lack food and clothing and demand grain and clothes, then encourage and lead them to distribute grain and ill-gotten wealth. As a result, the situation can be quickly broken through, and a mass movement can be formed. The other approach is to emphasize deliberation and then organize struggle. As a result, the breakthrough is slower or does not occur. According to the summary of the column's political work conference, the former approach is more adapted to the conditions of the new area. In the beginning, the masses can be directly led to distribute grain and ill-gotten wealth, but they cannot be led all the time; otherwise, it would be paternalism. The general process should be from not daring to do it themselves to doing it themselves, from night to day, from secret to public. If the masses dare to come forward from the beginning, the troops do not need to come forward to lead. The summary also pointed out: It is inevitable that the masses will be somewhat chaotic when they start doing things themselves. Don't be afraid of this, because the demands of the masses are extremely urgent. Don't be afraid of the chaos of the masses; being afraid of chaos will restrict the masses. The chaos of the masses doing it themselves is a step forward compared to us coming forward. If unfairness arises because of chaos, it will lead to their demand to organize. The combination of action, education, and organization, and continuous action, will gradually improve the movement and make it more in-depth. The process of continuous action is the process of the peasants raising their class consciousness. Some troops pursue numbers and use simple methods, resulting in administrative orders and formalism. These must be corrected and prevented.\n    The column's political work conference also made the following specific provisions: A. All officers and soldiers of the army have the responsibility to mobilize the masses. B. Each company and platoon should select five liberated soldiers to form a liberated group, led by the branch's mass movement committee member. The battalion does not have a special organization, but is directly led by the instructor. The regiment and brigade set up mass work teams, and a mass movement work committee is established under the regimental and brigade committees, with the director, political commissar, or deputy political commissar serving as secretary. C. Mainly relying on the training corps, more than 300 cadres will be transferred to ignite the spark in appropriate locations. D. The discipline of mass mobilization workers: 1. It is not allowed to eat the landlord's things or be lured by the landlord's interests. 2. It is not allowed to embezzle, destroy, or buy the fruits of struggle. 3. It is not allowed to molest women. 4. Keep the secrets of the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 从贫雇迫切要求出发  组织起来分粮分财  豫西我某纵队发动新区群众经验\n\n1948-02-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    从贫雇迫切要求出发\n    组织起来分粮分财\n    豫西我某纵队发动新区群众经验\n    【本报消息】我转战在豫西的野战某纵队，一面作战，一面发动群众，上自首长、下至炊事员、饲养员莫不积极参加，至去年十月底止，据不完全统计：三个旅及纵直四个单位，已在一百四十九个村和一座县城中发动了两万七千多群众，分了三十一万斤粮食，三千多亩地和大批浮财。建立了二十一村的农会，二十六个村的贫农小组。并出现了李宗林、田培勤等发动群众的模范，大大密切了军民关系，使新区群众迅速提高阶级觉悟，自动为解放军担任向导，组织担架，运送弹药，这一情形又反过来给部队一个极大的鼓舞和教育，使指战员信心更高，更加自觉的遵守群众纪律，作战更加英勇，发动群众也更加积极，这是重大的政治上的胜利，与军事胜利有同等的意义。\n    在发动群众中，该纵队有两种作法：一种是找贫雇农，从贫雇农的迫切要求出发。贫雇没吃没穿，要求粮食和衣服，那么就鼓励和带领他们去分粮分浮财，结果很快就能突破局面，形成群众运动，另一种是强调酝酿，再组织斗争。结果就突破得慢，或突不破，据纵队政工会议的总结，前一种作法比较适应新区的情况，开始时可以直接带领着群众去分粮分浮财，但不能一直带领下去，否则就是包办代替。一般的进程应是由不敢自己动手到自己动手，由黑夜到白天、由秘密到公开，如群众开始就敢出头，部队人员便不用出头带领。总结中又指出：群众自己动手开始难免有些乱，这不用怕，因为群众的要求异常急迫，不要怕群众乱，怕乱就会限制群众。群众自己动手的乱，比我们出头是前进了一步。如果因为乱而产生了不公平，就会引起他们组织起来的要求。行动与教育、组织相结合，连续行动，会逐渐提高，使运动深入。继续行动的过程，就是农民提高阶级觉悟的过程。有些部队追求数字，方式简单，发生行政命令，形式主义的毛病，必须纠正防止。\n    该纵队政工会议又作了以下几项具体规定：甲、全军干部、战士均有发动群众的责任，乙、每连、排选翻身战士五人，组成翻身小组，由支部民运委员领导，营不专设组织，由教导员直接领导，团、旅设群众工作队，并在团委、旅委下成立民运工作委员会，以主任、政委或副政委任书记；丙、以教导队为主，抽调三百以上干部，派赴适当地点点火；丁、发动群众工作者的纪律：一、不准吃地主东西、受地主利诱；二、不准贪污、破坏或收买斗争果实；三、不准调戏妇女；四、替群众保守秘密。"

Some said that being organized was restrictive and not as free. Old man Li Sipei said: \"Our labor cooperative organized ten poor hired and poor friends in February of this year to determine the management and cart pulling. At first, we were afraid of not benefiting; during the busy farming season, we also took care of seed. But in early October this year, when we settled accounts, we earned a total of 1.5 million yuan and 126 *shi* of millet (10 workers). The distribution was 20% for capital and 80% for labor, with 540,000 yuan divided among the 10 workers. Ten workers were absorbed, with a bonus of 360,000 yuan, and the rest was left to us.\" Military dependent Yang Jiude said: \"It's really good to be organized! In addition to helping to plant 16 *mu* of land, I received more than 10 *shi* of millet. Our six worker families collectively bought three donkeys and two cows.\" Their experience is that true voluntary association, with workers and capitalists in agreement, allows everyone to find ways to operate. Of the 241 full and semi-laborers in the whole village, 88 were organized to pull carts and sell goods outside. Ten were hauling charcoal, ten were twisting hemp, and three were regularly collecting manure. Seventy-six were engaged in outside production. Currently, 187 people are involved in the movement, including those working outside. Within one month, 75 households of hired and poor and those who have turned themselves around earned a total of 1,791,600 yuan. Nineteen old middle peasant households earned 239,200 yuan.\n    [Pingshun News] On December 22nd, the Pingshun Fifth District, Xi'an Shan Village, borrowed 170,000 yuan from the district credit bank and lent it to Chang Xi Wang and 14 other poor hired people, combined with 7 middle peasants to engage in transportation, led by Chang Lihong, with 12 mule carts, hauling salt from Xia County to Changzhi. One trip earned a gross profit of 1,081,000 yuan, and after deducting all expenses, the actual profit was 516,000 yuan. Now 14 mule carts have made a second trip. Recently, a meeting of poor hired, middle peasants, and village cadres was held to discuss and formulate a plan. This time, the bonus will be distributed to the poor hired to buy salt and coal for the New Year. The bonus distribution method is that the poor hired and middle peasants share together, with labor and capital clearly distinguished, so that no one suffers a loss. Finally, the political director said: \"The gross profit we earn is equal to earning a bonus. Because the livestock and people are all paid for outside.

    "content": "Greece\n    Asia, Europe, and Africa surround a large body of water, which is the Mediterranean Sea. On the northern shore of the Mediterranean, three peninsulas jut out like legs of land into the water. The easternmost leg is the Balkan Peninsula, and the tip of the peninsula is Greece. Its neighbors are Albania to the northwest, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast.\n    Greece is a small place, about the size of Fujian Province in China, with a small population of only seven million. It is mountainous, and the wheat produced is almost enough for domestic consumption. Tobacco leaves, olive oil, and fruits are produced in large quantities. Industry is limited to cigarette factories, flour mills, and wine-making factories.\n    Don't look down on this small place. Because of it, many United Nations meetings have been noisy and heated. The United States and Britain want to oppose the Soviet Union, so they want to create an \"anti-Soviet circle\" along the northern coast of the Mediterranean, through Turkey, into the Near East, and out to India. However, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania in the north are all New Democratic countries, which the United States is very jealous of. If it wants to invade, it must first occupy Greece and turn it into its own lackey, and then use this Balkan gateway to rob things from inside the house.\n    How could the Greek people go along with these robbers? Greece is such a glorious nation! In ancient times, Greek literature, art, philosophy, science... achieved the highest achievements. Greek civilization is the mother of Western civilization and has made great contributions to world culture. Later, it was invaded and ruled by other nations. But the Greek people have always fought for national liberation. In 1830, Greece was considered independent, but the country was still weak and relied on Britain and France.\n    During World War II, the fascist leader Mussolini sent troops to invade it. This small country defeated the Italian army miserably, which alarmed Hitler, who quickly mobilized German troops to help fight, using paratrooper forces to occupy Greece. However, the Greek people did not surrender. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they organized the People's Liberation Front and the People's Liberation Army to fight a guerrilla war against the German army. They fought heroically for more than three years, cooperating with the British landing, and completely liberated Greece. However, after the British troops landed, they brought the exiled government of the fascist royalists to power. British General Scobie used rockets and tanks to confiscate most of the People's Liberation Army's weapons and stayed in Greece. That was the \"Scobie\" policy that was often talked about earlier.\n    The Greek reactionnary government gained a foothold, and arrested and massacred the people, causing lawlessness. The people then rose up in resistance and fought a guerrilla war against it. At first, the guerrilla force had only 9,000 people. The reactionary government looked down on the power of the people and shouted wildly: \"Completely annihilate the guerrilla force in two weeks!\" It also said: \"Attack Belgrade (the capital of Yugoslavia)! Attack Sofia (the capital of Bulgaria)!\" However, although the reactionary government had more than 170,000 troops, it could not defeat the Greek Democratic Army guerrilla force. Unable to do anything, it spread rumors that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania were helping the Greek guerrillas. The United States and Britain also supported the Greek reactionary government in the United Nations, saying that it was necessary to investigate in order to fish in troubled waters and invade the countries of the Balkan Peninsula. They then passed a resolution in the United Nations to send an investigation team to Greece.\n    The Greek reactionary government, having suffered defeats, cried for help from the United States, selling 220,000 acres of Thracian lead mines to the United States.\n    Britain, because it did not have the strength to support the Greek reactionary government and suppress the people's movement, ceded its position to the United States. In order to implement the Truman Doctrine and invade Greece, the United States helped the Greek reactionary government with a lot of money and weapons. After the United Nations investigation team returned, the United States falsely claimed in the Security Council: \"Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania are helping the Greek guerrillas fight the Greek government,\" and demanded the establishment of a Balkan border monitoring group to freely go to Balkan countries to \"investigate\" and \"reconcile.\" The Soviet Union criticized the United States, opposed this approach, and said that foreign countries should not interfere in Greece, and that the Greek people should manage their country well, so that Greece could be independent and democratic, and have good relations with its neighbors. Yugoslavia and other countries also agreed with this view.\n    Last summer, the Greek Democratic Army launched an offensive across the country, attacking the capital Athens, and once reached a place thirty miles from Athens. The United States became anxious and sent military officers to help command the Greek government army. It also spent 160 million US dollars to appoint an American as the president of the Greek bank; the Greek reactionary government sold all its economic sovereignty to its American father. However, the reactionary faction was not stable internally. Last year, the reactionary government's expenses were in deficit by 400 million US dollars, and there were 30,000 people in Athens who went on strike to oppose the reactionary government. On the other hand, the Greek Democratic Army and the liberated areas were growing stronger day by day. Last October, it had an army of 170,000 people, as well as an air force. In November, the headquarters of the Democratic Army established an internal affairs committee to consolidate and expand the liberated areas. The Democratic Army helped farmers produce, and confiscated the property of fleeing landlords and merchants to open schools. Farmers also actively participated in and helped the Democratic Army. Farmers in places such as Chrisou village also organized self-defense forces to cooperate with the Democratic Army in combat. In some places, farmers voluntarily handed in public grain, and also said that they would work hard to produce more grain to support the front line. By December last year, the Greek Democratic Army had controlled two-thirds of the country's territory.\n    As the Greek Democratic Army and the liberated areas grew rapidly, the United States became even more anxious, and raised the past Balkan issue again for discussion at the United Nations General Assembly, organizing its capitalist lackey countries to raise their hands to pass the establishment of a \"Balkan Special Committee.\" At the same time, it ousted the royalists and called for the Liberal Party's Sophoulis to become prime minister, trying to deceive the Greek people. It also established a \"U.S.-Greece Joint Chiefs of Staff for the Army, Navy, and Air Force,\" with an American as the chief of staff, directly commanding the reactionary government army in combat.\n    However, the United States' artillery and money could not save the life of the Greek traitorous government after all. The Provisional People's Democratic Government of the Greek Liberated Area was established on the 24th of last month, and issued a declaration to the Greek people. Premier General Markos (a Communist Party member) also issued a New Democratic program, which proposed to liberate Greece from the oppression of American and British imperialism and its Greek running dogs, to handle national affairs by the people's democracy, to nationalize all foreign large enterprises, large banks, and heavy industries in Greece, to implement land reform, to give equal status to ethnic minorities, and to restore diplomatic relations with all countries, especially to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union and New Democratic countries in Eastern Europe. Recently, the Greek Democratic Army has launched a strong offensive on all fronts. Premier General Markos also issued an order, calling on the Greek people and the Democratic Army to strengthen the struggle against the enemy, overcome difficulties, and strive for final victory.

    "content": "My Emancipation is Just an Empty Name\n    Chai Renping\n    The day before yesterday, I met Wang Sanni's mother in Wu'an Wuji Town. She complained to me for a long time:\n    When my old man was young, he tilled land for others on a sharecropping basis. Later, he managed to acquire ten or so mu of land. Because we had many children, we couldn't support them all, so three of them went to Guan Dong to apprentice in business. Only the old man and I, and our two daughters-in-law, were left. Although times were bad, we could barely manage to drink thin porridge if we worked hard. But alas, the poor folks ran into a leap year, suffering two years of drought in a row. The old man starved to death, and our whole family was scattered, the family broken and the people dead. At that time, the \"old days\" were still in China, the roads were difficult, and the children couldn't return. The two daughters-in-law also ran away from hunger, and haven't returned to this day. Of our whole family of eight, only I am left. My emancipation is just an empty name. In July of this year, everyone else had already distributed the fruits of their labor several times. I asked my neighbors why they didn't call me to distribute the fruits. The neighbors said, \"You're not in the farmers' association, so you can't get approval.\" I said, \"Why don't you let me join the farmers' association?\" The neighbors said, \"The cadres think you're backward.\" I went to look for the political director, Yang Yusuo, and after running around several times, he finally let me join the farmers' association. They distributed to me a table, a water tank, a broken box, ten catties of cotton, a suit of clothes, and some scraps of cloth. But I still have no rice to eat. I can only rely on washing clothes and doing odd jobs for others to get a few catties of rice to drink, making a pot of thin porridge that I drink for several meals. \"In the summer, there was still cotton to spin, but now there isn't even a bit of cotton fluff. In the summer, I earned four thousand yuan, all of which I put into the cooperative, hoping to get a share of the profits in the twelfth lunar month, to buy some rice, and eat two good meals during the New Year. I also have to return the two thousand yuan I borrowed from my younger sister. Who knew that the cooperative's treasurer wouldn't let me get my share. He said that there was an order from above, fearing waste, and that there would be no profit sharing this year. It will only be shared in February next year. This is killing the poor folks. Never mind eating well during the New Year, I can't even get enough rice.\" She stopped there. I looked up and saw tears in her eyes. I immediately comforted her, saying, \"Old lady, don't cry. Didn't you hear the reading of the Outline Land Law in the farmers' association? Now we're going to thoroughly redistribute the land. Everyone will get a share of land and property. Poor households like yours will not only get a share but will also be specially cared for!\" She sighed and said, \"Chairman Mao's method is really good, but the cadres in our village just don't do it properly. The more people who are capable, eloquent, and good at talking, the more they can get. But those poor families like mine, who are more and more without anyone to rely on, can't get anything...\"\n    There must be more than just Wang Sanni's mother who have an empty name of emancipation.

    "content": "【Jinan News】 In Linzhang's Xiaopingying, a village of over a hundred households, when the bell rang during mass movements, the masses would immediately rush to the meeting place. Those working in the fields would quickly return. Seeing how promptly everyone attended meetings, the district cadres considered the Farmers' Association Director, Kang Sanming, to be capable, saying that this village didn't need leadership and that Kang alone could complete the tasks. Last year, the turning-over team mobilized the masses in this village, calling Xiaopingying a model, the most thorough village in the entire Third District. They praised it at the district village cadre meetings, reported on it in the newspapers, and even wrote pamphlets to introduce its experiences to various places. Recently, from the mouths of poor and hired peasants, it was learned that this was not the case at all. The past claims of good work were all forced by Kang Sanming. His mother has a godson who is now a battalion commander in the bandit Guo Qing's gang. In the village, he calls himself \"Old Liu Rong,\" looks down on the small district cadres, doesn't discuss matters with the cadres, let alone with the masses. The masses are all afraid of him. If anyone is late for a mass meeting, they have to kneel in the meeting place, and they can only stand up after the meeting is over, which is like wearing a tall hat and parading through the streets. They lead the militia, along with Zhao Shuanglin, a fleeing landlord living in their village (from Furen Village, Fourth District, Ci County), and a former puppet captain's guard called \"Iron Bell,\" and went to \"crack down on smuggling\" more than a dozen times. They seized a lot of foreign cloth, foreign cigarettes, foreign iron, grain, cotton, and other things, which they all divided up among themselves. The Farmers' Association kept forty-five mu of land. Last spring, they gathered all the livestock in the village and plowed and cultivated the land first. When hoeing, the Farmers' Association, the militia, the Women's Association, and the children all had to go, and the cadres supervised the work from behind. After the grain was harvested, it was calculated as belonging to Kang Sanming, Hei Bao, and three others, divided equally, and they even made the poor who had been allocated land pay public grain. The masses said: \"Without lifting a finger, they divide the grain to their homes, which is even worse than the landlords!\" The masses struggled against Zhang Zishou for six mu of good well-watered land, and the group discussion gave it to the three families of military dependents of Yang Wenzhong. Kang Sanming said: \"If you don't discuss according to policy, the meeting won't end in three days.\" The masses immediately understood what he meant and said: \"Director Kang, we've discussed it, is it okay to give you two mu and village deputy Hei Bao four mu?\" Kang Sanming said: \"Isn't that right! Meeting adjourned.\" In the summer, they detained the landlords and confiscated their belongings, only dividing the fruits without struggling against the landlords, which made the masses very dissatisfied. Last year, when dividing the fruits, the eight village cadre \"activists\" picked all the good things, leaving the broken ones for the masses to grab, and some poor people didn't get anything at all. This year, when dividing the fruits, they wrapped good clothes and cloth with broken hides, and wrapped good hides with broken things, assessed the price, and divided 4,000 yuan per share regardless of rich or poor. The cadres took them first, and only took the broken bundles, which cheated the masses again. Kang Sanming shouted on the street while beating a gong: \"No one can farm for the landlords and be a running dog.\" But he ate with the landlord Zhang Mingxin and even lent him four or five shi of grain. They ate the landlord's chickens and even ate the masses' chickens. With such a large tombstone weighing on the masses, let alone turning over to become masters, no one dared to speak out about suffering and grievances. Everyone hopes to kick away this stone and turn over as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “模范”原来是石板  小平营村干胡作非为\n\n1948-02-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    “模范”原来是石板\n    小平营村干胡作非为\n    【冀南消息】临漳小平营，一百多户人家，在群众运动的时候，把钟一打，群众就立时到会场，在地里做活的，也就赶快往回走。区干部见开会来的很齐，认为农会主任康三明能干，说这个村不用领导，光靠康主任就能完成任务。去年翻身队在这村发动群众，说小平营是典型，是全三区最彻底的村，在全区村干会上表扬，报上也表扬，还写小册子向各地方介绍经验。最近从贫雇农民口中了解，完全不是这么回事。过去说工作好，都是康三明强迫的。他娘有个干儿，现在土匪郭青里头当营长，他在村里自称“老刘荣”，看不起区里小干部，有事不和干部商量，更不和群众商量，群众都怕他。一开群众会，谁要到的晚了，就得跪到会场，多会开完会多会叫起来，不就是戴高帽子游街。他们领着民兵，还有一个住在他村的逃亡地主赵双林（磁县四区附任村人），还有一个伪队长护兵叫“铁钟”，带着枪去“缉私”有十几回，查的洋布、洋烟、洋铁、粮食、棉花等东西很多，他们都分了。农会留下四十五亩地，去年春天，把全村牲口都集合起来，先犁先耕。锄地时，农会、民兵、妇会、儿童都得去，干部们都在后边监工。收下粮食来，算成了康三明、黑保他们五个人的，按对半分，还叫分地穷人拿公粮，群众说：“不动手就把粮食分到家，这比地主还厉害呀！”群众斗争出张自受六亩水车井好地，小组讨论给了杨文仲他们三家军属，康三明说：“您不按政策讨论，三天也不能散会。”群众一看就明白了他的意思，就说：“康主任，我们讨论好了，给你二亩，给村副黑保四亩行吗？”康三明说：“这不对啦吗！散会吧。”夏天，把地主扣起来没收了东西，光分果实不斗地主，群众很不满。去年分果实，八个村干“积极分子”把好东西都拣了，剩下破的叫群众抢，有的穷人没抢到半点。今年分果实，把好衣服布匹包坏皮，坏东西包好皮，评上价，不分穷富每一股四千元，干部先拿，光拿破包袱皮的，又把群众坑的不轻。康三明在街上打着锣喊：“谁也不能给地主种地当狗腿。”他却给地主张明新伙吃饭，还借给他四五石粮食，他们吃了地主的鸡，连群众的鸡也吃了。群众身上压着这样一块大石板，别说翻身当家，受苦受气谁也不敢讲，大家盼着踢开这块石头早早翻身。"

    "content": "Reading the Newspaper: Common Knowledge\n\n    Franc Devaluation\n\n    The franc is the name of the money used in France, just like the American \"dollar\" and the British \"pound\" are used as a medium for exchanging goods.\n\n    Devaluation policy intentionally lowers the value of a country's money compared to foreign money in order to cope with economic panic and facilitate large capitalists to earn more money and plunder more of the laboring people's blood and sweat.\n\n    Since the First European War, this recent franc devaluation is the third time.\n\n    After the First European War, the franc, pound, and dollar were originally on par. American, British, and French capitalists used imperial power to form three groups dominating world finance, in order to plunder the resources of weaker countries. But in 1928, the world economy entered a stage of great panic. Due to the exploitation and waste of the big capitalists, France's financial expenditure was insufficient, and the currency inflated sharply. The French economy was also heading towards collapse. At that time, the French rulers implemented a franc devaluation, reducing the gold content of the franc to one-fifth of the pre-war level (at that time it was still on the gold standard). As a result, the French market became more chaotic, prices soared, the national economy fell into bankruptcy, and the lives of the French people became difficult to sustain. Therefore, the French people deeply hated the franc devaluation.\n\n    In 1933, in order to maintain the gold standard, France formed a gold bloc alliance with Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Switzerland, with the franc in a leading position. Later, because Britain and the United States abandoned the gold standard and implemented a \"devaluation\" policy to stimulate exports, it affected the French foreign market, causing capital outflow and imbalance of international payments. The annual income in 1935 was less than 5 billion francs, and the rulers filled this shortfall by issuing public bonds, thus increasing the burden on the people. Because of excess imports, capital outflow was triggered. In September 1936, the amount of gold stored in the Bank of France was only 5.2 billion francs, which was not enough to cover the amount of francs issued. In addition, the reactionary Laval government implemented a contractionary policy, tightening the national budget, reducing employee salaries and national living expenses, which increased the number of unemployed in France and made people's lives more difficult. Labor strikes surged, deepening the French economic panic. When the Blum cabinet was in power, it implemented an economic expansion policy, with \"public construction\" and \"national defense construction\" expenditures alone reaching 200 billion francs, which further increased France's import surplus. In the first half of that year (1936), the import surplus was 40 billion francs, double the import surplus in the same period of 1935, thus accelerating the outflow of French capital and increasing the amount of financial shortfall. When the French economy was on the verge of collapse, the French big capitalist rulers announced the abandonment of the gold standard and devalued the franc by about 30 percent. As a result, the goods of French big capitalists had the opportunity to be dumped in foreign markets, and they continued to obtain profits. However, the \"devaluation\" brought greater disasters to the French working people. The prices of domestic and imported goods rose, the purchasing power of the working people decreased, and it became more difficult to maintain their lives.\n\n    The recent franc devaluation implemented by the French reactionary government is nothing more than a way for French big capitalists to seek profits during economic panic. But this time, the \"franc\" does not have the autonomy that the \"franc\" had during the previous two devaluations. Because the French reactionaries rely on the United States, the franc is only an appendage of the dollar. This franc devaluation was implemented by the French reactionary government following the instructions of American imperialism, in order to facilitate the implementation of the \"Marshall Plan\" in France. It is a condition agreed upon by the American and French reactionaries: the United States gives the French reactionary government \"temporary assistance\" (which actually makes France lose its independence), and the French reactionary government has to agree to lower the value of the franc to increase the purchasing power of the dollar, so that it can buy French factories and industrial raw materials very cheaply. In this way, France will completely lose its independence, and the reactionary government will become more of a slave to American imperialism. Because the reactionary government is attached to the United States, the franc devaluation cannot prevent the dumping of American goods in France, and the French people will suffer more from the exploitation of rising prices.\n\n    This franc devaluation has been strongly opposed by the French working people and the petty bourgeoisie. The French people's movement is booming. As long as the French people unite and overthrow the reactionary government, this kind of reactionary plan of the American and French reactionaries cannot be implemented.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法郎贬值\n\n1948-02-04\n第2版()\n专栏：读报常识\n\n    法郎贬值\n    法郎是法国用的钱的名称，就同美国的“金元”、英国的“金镑”的作用一样，是法国人用来作交换商品的一种媒介。\n    贬值政策是有意的使本国的钱的价值比外国的钱降低，以应付经济恐慌，便于大资本家赚更多的钱，更多掠取劳动人民的血汗。\n    从第一次欧战后，最近这一次法郎贬值是第三次了。\n    第一次欧战后，法郎、英镑、美元原是平行的。美、英、法大资本家利用帝国强权，形成支配世界金融的三个集团，以便于他们掠夺弱小国家的资源。但一九二八年时，世界经济步入大恐慌阶段，法国由于大资本家的剥削浪费，财政开支不敷，通货剧烈膨胀，法国经济也日趋崩溃。那时法国统治者就实行过一次法郎贬值，把法郎的纯金降低到战前五分之一（那时还是金本位）。结果，法国市场更加混乱，物价暴涨，国民经济陷于破产，法国人民生活难以维持，因此法国人民对法郎贬值，深恶痛恨。\n    一九三三年法国为维持金本位，与意、荷、波、瑞等国组成金集团联盟，法郎居领导地位。后因英、美放弃金本位，实行“贬值”政策，刺激出口，影响法国国外市场，使法国资金外流，国际收支不平衡，岁入不足，一九三五年不足五十亿法郎，统治者以增发公债填补此不足之额，因此人民负担加重。因为入超，引起资金外流，一九三六年九月法兰西银行存金额，仅五百二十万万法郎，不足应付法郎发行之额，加以赖伐尔反动政府执行紧缩政策，紧缩国家预算，减低员工薪金及国民生计费，使法国失业者增加，人民生活愈加困难，工潮澎湃，加深法国经济恐慌。至勃伦内阁时，又实行经济扩张政策，仅“公共建设”、“国防建设”费就达二百万万法郎，又增加了法国入超数字，当年（三六年）上半年入超数为四十万万法郎，比一九三五年同期入超数增加了一倍，于是加速法国资金外流，财政上不敷之数增加，法国经济崩溃在即时，法国大资本家统治者们就宣布放弃金本位，并贬低法郎价值约为百分之三十。因此法国大资本家的货物得到倾销国外市场的机会，继续取得利润。但“贬值”带给法国劳动人民的是更大灾害，国内物品及输入品的物价上涨，劳动人民购买力降低，生活的维持更加困难。\n    最近法国反动政府又实行法郎贬值，无非又是法国大资本家在经济恐慌时寻求利润的办法。但这次“法郎”却没有前两次贬值时的“法郎”有自主权了。由于法国反动派的依靠美国，法郎就只是美元的附属物。这次法郎贬值，是法国反动政府听从美帝的吩咐而实行的，是为了便于“马歇尔计划”在法国实行。是美法反动派讲好了的条件，美国给法国反动政府以“临时援助”（实际是使法国丧失独立），法国反动政府就得答应把法郎价值降低，使美元的购买力增强，能够很便宜的购买法国的工厂和工业原料。这样，法国就将要完全丧失独立，反动政府就更成为美帝国主义的奴隶。因为反动政府依附美国，法郎贬值也不能阻止美货在法国的倾销，法国人民将更受物价上涨的剥削。\n    这次法郎贬值已遭到法国劳动人民及中小资产阶级的强烈反对，法国人民运动正蓬勃发展，只要法国人民团结一致，打垮反动政府，美法反动派这类反动计划也就不能实行了。"

    "content": "International Week (Xinhua News Agency)\n\n    American Democratic Forces Grow Stronger; French Workers and Peasants Achieve Militant Unity\n    In the past week, the American people have launched a movement against US imperialist aggression in the Far East, namely the \"National Conference on American Policy toward China and the Far East\" held in New York. This conference was initiated by the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, with participants including representatives from 107 American organizations. The conference strongly condemned the US imperialist policy of aggression and expansion in the Far East, especially the policy of helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang carry out a civil war and massacre the Chinese people. It also passed important resolutions demanding action to stop the transportation of weapons, ammunition, and other aid to the Chiang bandits and the Dutch and French aggressors in Indonesia and Vietnam. This righteous call has been enthusiastically echoed by the American working class. The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, and others are prepared to begin boycotting the US government's shipments of aid to Chiang. Progressive leaders of several CIO, AFL, and independent unions have loudly proclaimed: \"Stop the shipment of arms to China (Chiang) and other countries,\" \"Support any action that deprives the makers of China's reactionary war of weapons.\" This action by the progressive people of America demonstrates the close unity of the international democratic anti-imperialist camp. This not only strikes at the reactionary American government and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, but also encourages the Chinese people and the oppressed nations of the Far East who are fighting for liberation. At the same time, a movement resisting the anti-communist and anti-democratic actions of the American reactionaries is also rising within the United States. American workers and democratic groups are preparing to launch a magnificent movement to protest the US authorities' heinous anti-communist and anti-democratic policies. All of this confirms what Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, pointed out: \"Within the United States, there exists a growing force of people's democracy.\"\n    In France and Italy, the people's movements continue to surge. The wave of French people resisting the reactionary authorities' betrayal of the country and harming the people has \"spread rapidly throughout France\" (TASS). Angry mass rallies are being held everywhere from Dunkirk to the Seine province. Workers, peasants, small and medium-sized merchants, and professionals have all joined this struggle. The National Congress of Peasants' Representatives, initiated by the French Communist Party, has opened grandly in Paris. In the letter to the French peasants published by the Congress of Representatives, it was emphasized that \"only the French Communist Party is the firm defender of the interests of the French peasants.\" Therefore, they \"approved the program proposed by the Communist Party, that is, to struggle to improve the lives of French peasants and to establish a truly democratic people's government.\" The convocation of the National Congress of Peasants' Representatives shows that the French working class has achieved militant unity with the French peasants, and they are prepared to fight shoulder to shoulder to realize a new democratic France. In Italy, to answer the police's atrocities against unemployed workers who were demonstrating, the province and city of Florence and its nearby forty-nine towns held a victorious general strike. Demonstrations and strikes have occurred everywhere in Milan, Turin, Airona, Pisa, Livorno, Naples, Turin, and other places. At the same time, the Italian people are also rising up to protest the US imperialist infringement on Italian sovereignty and seizure of Italian military bases. This \"has given the rising wave of strikes and demonstrations a national dimension.\" (TASS)\n    The greater strength of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries is also encouraging the world democratic movement. The summary of last year's production published by the Soviet State Planning Commission shows that industrial production not only completed the plan, but also made up for the previous year's deficit, and agricultural production has completely recovered to pre-war levels, increasing by 32 percent compared to the previous year. South, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and other countries have also basically completed last year's economic plans. Hungary and Romania signed a twenty-year treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance last week. Recently, the Soviet Union and Poland also concluded two economic agreements stipulating that they will vigorously help Poland develop its economy under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. These all point out the correct path for the European people to seek foreign aid to revive their countries in accordance with the spirit of equality, friendship, and mutual benefit. And the separate conclusion of trade agreements between Belgium and Luxembourg and the Soviet Union is tantamount to a slap in the face to the so-called Marshall Plan that enslaves Western Europe.\n    In the past week, US imperialism once again issued an order to its servant, the Labor government, to have Britain \"act as the firefighter to save the Marshall Plan,\" fearing that this paper house of the \"Marshall Plan\" would be burned down by the world's people's growing anger of resistance. Therefore, Bevin hurriedly came out to rehash Churchill's old tune of a \"Western European Group,\" and also conspired to organize the so-called \"Middle East Group\" to save and supplement the \"Marshall Plan\" which is \"heading for collapse\" (Pravda). But as soon as Bevin's two magic weapons were offered, they were immediately met with resistance from the powerful forces of the people, and first suffered defeat in the Middle East. The \"Anglo-Iraqi Alliance Treaty,\" as the first step of the \"Middle East Group,\" was declared abolished under the strong opposition of the Iraqi people. The anti-British demonstration of 100,000 residents in Baghdad, the anti-British demonstration of Egyptian students, the \"severance of diplomatic relations with Britain\" demonstration in Damascus, Syria, etc., frightened British imperialism, and it had to temporarily shelve its attempt to organize the \"Middle East Group\" and postpone the signing of \"alliance treaties\" with various Arab countries. This incident shows that the power of the people can curb reactionary conspiracies, and it also shows that the conspiracy of US and British imperialism to organize a \"Western European Group\" to suppress the European democratic and anti-imperialist movement must eventually fail.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: Reports from various sources indicate that Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, recently delivered two notes to the US State Department on behalf of the Soviet government, protesting against the US imperialist aggression in violation of the Italian Peace Treaty. In his note of January 28th, it was pointed out that US warships carrying US Marines had docked at the Italian ports of Naples, Taranto, Livorno, and Genoa, in violation of Article 73 of the Italian Peace Treaty (which stipulates that the Allied armed forces stationed in Italy must withdraw from Italy before December 15, 1947). The Soviet government hopes that the US government will immediately take measures to stop the aforementioned violations of the Italian Peace Treaty. The Soviet government also forwarded the full text of the above note to the French government, requesting that it share the contents of the note with all Allied countries that signed the Italian Peace Treaty. Another Soviet note, issued on January 21st, protested against the separate agreement concluded by Britain and the United States to rebuild an air force base at Mellaha, near Tripoli, in the former Italian colony of Libya, temporarily under British control. The note pointed out that this is in conflict with the Italian Peace Treaty and is therefore illegal. The Soviet Union also sent the same note to the British government simultaneously. The illegal actions of Britain and the United States in the former Italian colonies have also aroused dissatisfaction among British and Egyptian democrats and public opinion.

The Chiang Kai-shek State Council has approved an increase of 50 percent in import tariffs from the beginning of this year, and the salt tax has been increased from 100,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan (Chiang currency) per dan. The Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Finance has also revised the collection methods for business income tax, stipulating that the Chiang Kai-shek local tax authorities can arbitrarily determine the tax amount, forcibly order various industries and businesses to pay in advance, and set a deadline of one month from the date of notification to pay in full. Those who fail to pay within the deadline will be fined 20 to 300 percent of the tax amount or ordered to suspend business, with compulsory recovery. In addition, local cigarette taxes have also been increased by 100 to 300 percent.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd. A synthesis of news from newspapers and magazines in the Chiang-controlled areas: By the end of last year, the total amount of paper money issued by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had exceeded 100 trillion yuan, forming a severe hyperinflation, and exposing a true intention behind the Chiang bandits' recent clamor for \"currency reform,\" which is to attempt to continue squeezing the blood and sweat of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas with new scams at a time of desperation. The Chiang bandit authorities have always been secretive about the amount of their paper money issuance. Earlier this year, Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance of the Chiang government, unexpectedly announced that the total amount was 25 trillion yuan, but economists in the Chiang-controlled areas generally believe that this figure is false and its purpose is to cover up the truth about the Chiang bandits' hyperinflation. A professor of economics at Peking University pointed out in an article in the Tianjin \"Minguo Daily,\" a Chiang Party newspaper, on New Year's Day this year, that the amount of Chiang currency issued at the end of 1946 was 10 trillion yuan, and that it increased to 16 trillion yuan in the first three months of last year. According to conservative estimates, the amount issued at the end of last year should be 70 to 80 trillion yuan, and this does not include the 20,000, 40,000, and 100,000 yuan banknotes issued from December 10th of last year. According to a Shanghai dispatch in a Beijing magazine, the author collected various versions and colors of Chiang currency below 10,000 yuan on the market at the end of November and statistically analyzed the ticket numbers. At that time, the total amount of Chiang currency issued had reached about 150 trillion yuan. In order to rush to print paper money to supply its huge fiscal expenditures, the Chiang bandit clique, in addition to the Chiang-controlled \"Central Printing Plant\" and its branches, the Zhonghua Book Company, the China Daye Printing Company and other companies stepped up printing, and also placed large orders with the British De La Rue and the American printing companies. Even the semi-official Chiang bandit newspaper, the Beijing \"Jingshi Daily,\" exclaimed: It is expected that banknotes with large denominations of one million and two million yuan will appear in 1948.\n\nDue to the malignant expansion of the Chiang currency, prices in the Chiang-controlled areas, taking Shanghai as an example, were 145,000 times higher than before the Anti-Japanese War in December last year, but when Japan surrendered in 1945, the Shanghai price index was only 1,100 times higher than before the war. Prices in Peiping were even higher, rising to 180,000 times higher than before the Anti-Japanese War in mid-December. The rise in prices in the Chiang-controlled areas has been increasing more rapidly year by year. In the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, the annual increase was less than 50 percent. From 1941 to 1945, when Japan surrendered, the annual increase was only three to three and a half times. In 1946, the price increase was about five times, but last year it increased sharply to twelve to fifteen times in one year.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd. Shanghai newspapers revealed: The four major family banks use the privilege of unlimited issuance of banknotes as a tool to plunder the people's blood and sweat. This is the secret of why the Chiang bandit gang adopted a policy of inflation. The Chiang, Kong, and Political Science clique's \"Central Bank\" enjoys the exclusive power to issue Chiang currency. It can directly issue Chiang currency in addition to the Chiang government's fiscal payments, engage in speculation and monopoly activities, and can conduct \"re-mortgages\" with various commercial firms. The firms are nominally required to pay 70% of the collateral, but in fact, they do not need to pay it to receive the money, so in fact, it is equivalent to the firms doing 30% and the Central Bank doing 70%. In addition to the Central Bank, the Song family's Bank of China, the Chiang family and Chen family's Farmers Bank, the Political Science clique and Chen family's Bank of Communications, the \"Central Bank\" subsidiary, the Central Trust Bureau, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the Chen family's Central Cooperative Treasury and other six banks and bureaus also obtained benefits from the spoils. They can all \"re-mortgage\" to the Central Bank, and can also borrow money from the Central Bank at any time under the pretext of \"poor turnover\" to engage in commercial speculation and financial activities, and the amount is \"almost unlimited.\" As for the Central Bank's so-called deposits, they are actually the Chiang bandit government's \"public funds,\" most of which are newly issued Chiang currency. Therefore, the six banks and bureaus \"re-mortgaging\" or \"borrowing\" from it is actually equivalent to issuing new banknotes in advance, or increasing the circulation rate of so-called \"public funds\" or new banknotes. A large part of the huge blood and sweat lost by the people in the Chiang-controlled areas in the accelerated rise in prices has therefore fallen into the private pockets of the four major families.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪大量印票子掠夺人民血汗  形成严重恶性通货膨胀  蒋区物价去年一年涨了十五倍\n\n1948-02-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    蒋匪大量印票子掠夺人民血汗\n    形成严重恶性通货膨胀\n    蒋区物价去年一年涨了十五倍\n    【新华社陕北二日电】综合蒋区报章杂志消息：截至去年年底止，蒋匪纸币发行总额，已超过一百万亿元，形成严重的恶性通货膨胀，并暴露出蒋匪最近喧嚷“货币改革”的一个真正意图，即是企图于山穷水尽之时，以新骗术来继续压榨蒋区人民的血汗。蒋匪当局对其纸币发行数额一向讳莫如深，年前蒋政府财政部次长徐柏园忽破例宣布该项总数为二十五万亿元，但蒋区一般经济学家都认为这个数字是假的，其目的是企图掩盖蒋匪恶性通货膨胀的真相。北大一经济系教授今年元旦在蒋党报纸天津民国日报著文指出，一九四六年底蒋币发行数为十万亿元，去年头三个月即增至十六万亿元，据保守的估计，去年底的发行额应为七十万亿到八十万亿元，而年前十二月十日起发行的二万、四万、十万元大钞尚未计算在内。另据北平一杂志载上海通讯，作者在年前十一月底曾收集市面万元以下各种版样、颜色不同之蒋币，并对其票面号码加以统计，发现当时蒋币发行总额已约达一百五十万亿元之巨。蒋匪为了赶印纸币供其庞大的财政开支，除由蒋记“中央印刷厂”及其各分厂、中华书局、中国大业印刷公司等加紧印制之外，并向英国德罗尼及美国印钞公司大量订制。连蒋匪半官方报纸北平经世日报亦惊呼：预料一九四八年内将有一百万及二百万元之大面额钞票出现。\n    由于蒋币恶性膨胀，蒋区物价以上海为例，年前十二月已为抗战前的十四万五千倍，但一九四五年日本投降时，上海物价指数尚仅为战前的一千一百倍。北平物价则更高，十二月中旬已上涨为抗战前的十八万倍。蒋区物价的上涨，一年比一年涨得猛，抗战初期每年上涨不及百分之五十，一九四一年至一九四五年日本投降时，每年上涨亦仅三倍至三倍半，一九四六年物价上涨约为五倍，但去年则骤增为一年内上涨十二倍到十五倍。\n    【新华社陕北二日电】沪报透露：四大家族银行利用无限度发行钞票特权，作其掠夺人民血汗的工具，这就是蒋匪帮所以采取通货膨胀政策的秘密。蒋、孔及政学系的“中央银行”，享有发行蒋币独占权力，可以直接在蒋政府财政支付之外增发蒋币，从事投机及垄断活动，并可对各商业行庄进行“转抵押”，承放行庄名义上须缴七成押金，但实际并不缴纳即可领款，故实际上等于承放行庄做三成，央行做七成。除中央银行外，宋家的中国银行，蒋家与陈家的农民银行，政学系与陈家之交通银行，“中央银行”子公司中央信托局、邮政储金汇业局及陈家的中央合作金库等六行局库，亦获得分赃利益，它们都可以向中央银行“转抵押”，随时还可以借口“周转不灵”向中央银行“拆款”，以从事商业投机及金融活动，而其数额是“几乎没有限度的”。至于中央银行的所谓存款，实际上就是蒋匪政府的“公款”，其中绝大部分即是新发行的蒋币，因此六行局库向它“转抵押”或“拆款”，实际上等于提前发行新钞，或增加所谓“公款”或新钞的流通速率。蒋区人民在物价加速飞涨中所损失的巨大血汗，很大一部分即因此落入四大家族的私囊。"

As of the end of January, a total of 9,083 bandits and diehards have been annihilated in 74 battles, with the capture of 7 mortars, 86 light and heavy machine guns, and 5,574 long and short guns. The three puppet security regiments of Song County, Baofeng, and Xiangcheng, as well as Xia Dian in Linru and Shangdian in Yiyang, two notorious bandit gangs, have been completely annihilated in successive battles. The puppet security regiments of Lushan, Yiyang, and Yuxian have also been largely annihilated. Ping Wenzheng, the puppet commander of Yuxian, Dengfeng, and Linru counties, and many other bandit leaders, including the puppet regiment commander of Baofeng, have been killed in battle. The long-term lairs of the bandits and diehards, such as Daying, Zhaobao, Tianhu, and Minggao, have been successively eliminated by us. In the early stage of the suppression, the bandits and diehards stubbornly resisted, relying on the stockades they had built. After being severely damaged by us, they mostly resorted to fleeing at the first sign of trouble. However, under the combined attack of our armed suppression, disintegration and winning over, and mobilizing the masses to capture bandit leaders and search for guns, they still could not escape the fate of being annihilated. After being forced into banditry, the peasants, after understanding the Liberation Army's policies of distributing land and grain, were mostly unwilling to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek's landlords. As soon as they came into contact with our army, they laid down their weapons. The ratio of bandits killed and wounded to those captured alive in battle was 1:2.3 in the early period of November last year, and it has now changed to 1:11 in January of this year. The masses, who had long suffered from bandit harassment, fought extremely hard for our annihilation of the bandits.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, February 2nd: The Civil Affairs Department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently summarized its work on mobilizing the masses accompanying the army during the four-month counteroffensive. According to incomplete statistics, from August 23rd, when it crossed the river south, to the end of December, the unit mobilized the masses (mainly by distributing floating wealth) in 1,201 villages, with approximately 530,000 peasants participating, distributing 33 million catties of grain and 1,787 mu of land. The result of this work is that the peasants have gained an understanding of and support for our army, and it has provided strong assistance to the construction of the Yu-Shaan-E liberated area. The troops participating in mobilizing the masses have also strengthened their mass viewpoint. However, two main shortcomings were also discovered in the movement. One is that the distribution of floating wealth was mostly hasty and perfunctory, and rich peasants also took the opportunity to participate. In addition, much of the landlords' floating wealth was dispersed and concealed in advance, so poor peasants did not gain much fruit, and it was not easy to inspire the enthusiasm of poor peasants, so it was not possible to cultivate active poor peasant activists well, so as to facilitate the in-depth development of the movement and the continued leadership of the local system. Therefore, it is necessary to organize them in the course of the movement. Another shortcoming is that it simply stopped at the stage of distributing floating wealth. However, the experience of several places has proved that even if the time is not long, as long as the method is correct, it can also be in-depth. In the movement, the masses' urgent demand is to disarm the landlords to arm themselves, and this demand is often more urgent than the distribution of floating wealth and land. If the peasants do not have armed forces to suppress the landlords' counter-offensive, they will not be able to keep anything that is distributed. Another key to going deeper is to strengthen the organizational work in the course of the movement. Among the villages that have been mobilized and the masses who have participated in the aforementioned statistics, the number of poor peasant groups or peasant associations that have been formed and the number of people who have participated in poor peasant groups or peasant associations is not large, and very little of the best complaint education has been adopted. Now, based on these experiences, we are boldly and actively taking the mass line to promote the work of mobilizing the masses.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, February 2nd: A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to mobilize the masses, and emphasized the need to learn from poor peasants and hired laborers in order to transform their own thinking and style. The Logistics Department alone sent 136 people to the countryside. Before departing, everyone proposed living the life of poor peasants, uniting with hired laborers, organizing complaints to raise the class consciousness of themselves and the masses, and learning the firm stance of hired laborers in the movement. Commander Wu Chengxian of the unit first carried his backpack and led a group of cadres from a key point village to set off. Chief of Staff Yang Jin also led another group to the countryside. They lived with hired laborers in the village, ate cornbread and corn and sorghum porridge with sesame leaves, and after eating the food of the hired laborers, they handed over all the grain and money for groceries they brought to the peasants. In addition to their work, they fetched water and did chores for the hired laborers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫陕鄂解放军某部发动群众  五十三万农民参加斗争\n\n1948-02-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    豫陕鄂解放军某部发动群众\n    五十三万农民参加斗争\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】解放军某部民运部近曾总结反攻四个月的随军发动群众工作。根据不完全统计，自八月二十三日渡河南征迄十二月底，该部曾在一千二百零一个村庄发动过群众（主要是分浮财），参加的农民约有五十三万余人，分得粮食三千三百万斤，田地一千七百八十七亩。这一工作进行的结果，已取得农民对我军的了解与拥护，并对建设豫陕鄂解放区以有力的帮助。参加发动群众的部队并从而加强了群众观点。但是在运动中也发现了两个主要缺点。一个是分浮财时大多仓促草率，富农亦乘机参加，再加不少地主浮财事前均行分散隐蔽，所以雇贫得到果实不多，而不容易启发雇贫的积极性，因而不能很好培养雇贫积极分子，以便于运动的深入发展及地方系统的继续领导。因此需要在运动过程中组织起来。另一个缺点是单纯停在分浮财阶段。但是几个地方的经验证明，即使时间不长，只要做法对，同样可以深入的。在运动中群众迫切的要求是解除地主武装来武装自己，这一要求常常较之分浮分地更为迫切。农民如果没有武装去镇压地主的反攻，分配什么东西都是保不住的。深入的另一关键是加强运动过程中的组织工作。前述统计发动过的村庄与参加的群众中，已组成贫农小组或农会的及参加贫农小组或农会的数字不大，最好的诉苦教育也很少采用。现正依据这些经验大胆放手积极走群众路线，推进发动群运工作。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二日电】解放军某部抽调大批干部下乡发动群众，并强调提出向雇贫农学习，以改造自己的思想作风。仅后勤部就抽出一百三十六人下乡。大家在出发前提出过贫农生活，与雇贫结合，组织诉苦以提高自己及群众的阶级觉悟，并在运动中学习雇贫农的坚定立场。该部司令员武承先同志首先背起背包，带领一个基点村的干部出发。参谋处长杨进同志也率领另一个组下乡。他们在村里跟雇贫农一块住，一块吃红薯、芝麻叶的窝窝和玉米、高粱糊糊，他们吃了雇贫农的饭，便把带来的粮食和菜金，全部交给农民。并在工作之余，为雇贫挑水、做杂活。"

Since the land reform last year, we haven't seen any beggars. Today, we suddenly encountered an old man, over fifty years old, wearing clothes with countless patches, begging from door to door. We felt very strange. We poor people are of one heart, so Comrade Liu Ling gave him her allowance and asked about his background. According to him, he is Chen Jinlong from Xiao Village, Fourth District of Guantao. His family consists of four people: two young girls and a blind wife who has been begging since she was a child. He said that they still have no way to live. He has been begging all along. He did not receive any fruits of the land reform last year, so they still have to beg. His pass reads: \"This is to certify that Chen Jinlong, a poor peasant from this village, has no way to make a living and is allowed to beg in various villages.\" It bears the official seal of the village office and the personal seal of Village Head Li Shoushen. We didn't believe this was true, so we investigated with the local masses and village cadres, and it turned out to be true. Therefore, we are writing to your newspaper to publish this, fearing that there may be similar phenomena in other places. From this incident, it can be seen that our land reform is not thorough enough. We should pay more attention, especially to smoothly implement the Central Committee's promulgated Land Law Outline. We have seen that in some villages, landlords still wear fancy clothes and live comfortable lives. Such things are too unreasonable. It is impossible for the poor to completely turn themselves over without thoroughly crushing the landlords. We hope that the relevant responsible cadres will pay attention.\n        (Hao Jin-su, Liu Ling, January 26)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 赶快纠正这种不合理的现象  村长开上通行证  叫贫农沿村讨饭\n郝金苏  刘玲\n1948-02-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    赶快纠正这种不合理的现象\n    村长开上通行证  叫贫农沿村讨饭编者同志：\n    我们是后方野战医院总院直属所学员，驻于馆陶某庄。自去年进行土地改革后，没见过要饭的人。今天忽然碰到一个五十余岁的老头，身穿千层补绽的衣服，沿门乞食。我们很觉奇怪，咱们穷人是一个心，刘玲同志就将津贴费送了他。并询问其来历。据他说是馆陶第四区肖村人，名叫陈金龙，家内四口人，两个小女孩，一个老婆是瞎子，从小讨饭，一直至今。去年土地改革未分果实，仍无法生活，所以仍要饭。他的通行证上写着：“兹有本村贫农陈金龙无法生活，到各庄要饭。”按着村公所公章，与村长李寿绅的手章。我们还未相信实情，便向当地群众、村干调查，确是如此。所以我们写信请贵报发表，恐怕其它地方也有这样现象。从这件事看，我们的土地改革是不够彻底的。特别为顺利执行中央颁布之土地法大纲，更应注意。我们看到有些村子的地主仍穿红挂绿，过着舒适的生活，这样的事情太不合理，不能彻底摧垮地主，穷人翻透身是不可能的，希有关的负责干部注意。        （郝金苏、刘玲一月二十六日）"

At that time, the situation was serious. Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops mobilized large forces to repeatedly \"suppress\" them, completely burned down vast mountainous villages, forced farmers to \"merge villages,\" creating \"no-man's-lands,\" attempting to starve the guerrillas to death. At the same time, they carried out massacres of the masses and the guerrillas' families. Shi Zhizhai, the Chiang bandit's fourth district commissioner in Shangluo Town, even set up two guillotines specifically to slaughter the unyielding people of southern Shaanxi. When Comrade Gong Defang, the founder of the guerrilla unit, died of illness last spring, the Chiang bandits even dug up his body from the grave and carried it to Shang County, shamelessly claiming that they had \"captured Gong Defang alive.\"\n\nIn these difficult days, Cai Xingyun's guerrilla unit tenaciously persisted in the struggle. They lived in the forests, sleeping in the open air, often going without food for days. But whenever they had the chance, they would suddenly appear behind the enemy. Although the masses were forced to move into the Chiang bandit strongholds, they still thought about their own armed forces, sending them intelligence at any time, risking their lives to carry grain to the mountains to find them. With the love and support of the people, they fought for eight months.\n\nThe great counter-offensive began, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River in a rapid maneuver, and part of it advanced rapidly into southern Shaanxi. Cai Xingyun's guerrilla unit met their older brothers in a frenzy of joy, which further increased their fighting spirit and courage. The number of members quickly doubled, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, they were also equipped with small cannons and new-style machine guns. The newly formed guerrilla unit continued to haunt the enemy's rear along the Dan River. Starting from the Shangluo area, they annihilated an enemy Bao-Gong office in a certain place, capturing eight enemy Bao chiefs and others, and seizing twenty-five guns. After several consecutive battles, the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan gang and local tyrants and evil gentry were all terrified. Under the prestige of the guerrilla unit, the security team of a certain town in Shang County, led by Captain Zhang Zhenshan, revolted and joined the guerrilla unit, bringing over eleven people, one light machine gun, and eight pistols. Another person surnamed Yao also brought over a dozen people.\n\n(Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaanxi-E dispatch)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 出没于陕南蒋后的蔡兴运游击队\n彭籁\n1948-02-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    出没于陕南蒋后的蔡兴运游击队\n    彭籁\n    在陕南提起蔡兴运和他的游击队，匪顽个个害怕，群众人人兴奋。\n    前年冬季他们便在丹江沿岸开始艰苦的游击战，当时情况严重，蒋胡匪调集大军反复“清剿”，并把广大山地村庄完全烧光，强迫农民“并村”，造成“无人区”，企图困死游击队。同时对群众和游击队的家属，大加屠杀。在商雒镇的蒋匪四区专员史直斋就设了两把铡刀、专门屠杀不屈的陕南人民。游击队的创始者巩德芳同志去年春季病逝，蒋匪竟把他的尸体从坟墓里挖出来抬到商县，无耻的说“活捉了巩德芳”。\n    在这些严重的日子里，蔡兴运的游击队顽强的坚持着斗争。他们住在森林中，露天睡觉，常常几天没有饭吃。但是一有机会就突然出现在敌人背后。群众虽被迫迁到蒋匪据点里，仍然惦记着自己的武装，随时给他们传送情报，冒着危险背上粮食到山里找他们。在人民的爱护支援下，他们斗争了八个月。\n    大反攻开始，解放军飞渡黄河，一部分神速的挺进到陕南。蔡兴运游击队在狂欢中和老大哥会师，就更增加了斗志和勇气。队员很快增加了两倍，在解放军的帮助下也装备了小炮和新式机枪。新生的游击队继续出没于丹江沿岸蒋匪后方。他们由商雒地区出发，就在某地歼灭敌人一个保公所，俘敌保长等八名，缴枪二十五支。接连又打了好几仗，蒋胡匪帮及当地恶霸土劣都吓破了胆。在游击队的声威下，商县某镇保安队在队长张振山率领下起义，投奔游击队，带过来十一个人，轻机枪一挺，手枪八支。另一个姓姚的也带过来十几个人。\n                （新华社豫陕鄂电）"

    "content": "Epitome of Millions of Liberated Fighters\n    Special Class Hero He Daqing\n    Liberated fighter He Daqing is one of the tens of thousands of liberated fighters. He originally belonged to the 1st Company of the Transportation Battalion of the 24th Brigade of the 76th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in northern Shaanxi. He was liberated by our forces during a guerrilla war last April and immediately joined the People's Liberation Army. In six months, he participated in dozens of battles, and his name was written on the merit book eight times. He was initially awarded the title of \"Model Soldier\" and later promoted to platoon leader. He is an excellent machine gunner, and his greatest characteristics are his extraordinary bravery in battle and strict adherence to battlefield discipline. During the Shajiadian battle last year, he used his machine gun to repel several enemy counterattacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. When the enemy retreated, he grabbed his rifle and grenades and desperately pursued them, capturing a large number of weapons. He only realized he was barefoot when he returned after the battle. He did not take any of the enemy's abandoned rubber shoes. He also possesses unparalleled perseverance in enduring hardship and a spirit of helping comrades. Despite the blisters on his hands, he dug a single-person foxhole in ten minutes and two machine gun emplacements in one hour. His motto is: \"Sweat more in peacetime, bleed less in wartime.\" Once, when the unit was traveling through the desert, he was suffering from dysentery. The company commander advised him to stay behind to recuperate, but he resolutely refused, gritting his teeth and keeping up with the unit. He was afraid of falling behind along the way, so he simply took off his pants and walked, often carrying his machine gun and helping weaker comrades carry their guns. During a battle last year, the unit marched more than 150 li (approximately 75 kilometers) every day, and many comrades were very tired. Every day upon reaching the destination, Platoon Leader He Daqing would let the soldiers rest, while he busied himself boiling water for everyone to wash their feet.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 3rd of this month: The heroic and unyielding people of southern Shaanxi, under the brutal \"village consolidation and relocation\" policy of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, have risen up to save themselves, launching the Four-Anti (Anti-Capture, Anti-Tax, Anti-Conscription, Anti-Contribution) Movement everywhere. Guerrilla forces are also active on both sides of the Dan River, inflicting significant casualties on Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops.\n\nIn October of last year, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, imitating the \"village consolidation and relocation\" methods of the Japanese puppets in Manchukuo, ordered residents of all mountain villages to move to Chiang's strongholds. The people resisted fiercely, fleeing to the remote mountains and forests when faced with large groups of Chiang's bandit troops, and resolutely resisted individual Chiang bandit henchmen. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops then ordered the burning of villages. This atrocity was carried out as early as the winter of the year before last, when hundreds of villages were burned at once. For example, in the area east of Lantian, starting from Xujiamiao Town, the large and small villages in several river valleys within a radius of fifty *li* were all burned, with as many as 3,500 households victimized at one time. Furthermore, in the area east of Luonan, on the north bank of the Dan River, except for a few Chiang Kai-shek bandit strongholds such as Lingdan Temple, the area extending one hundred and twenty *li* east-west and fifty *li* north-south was all burned. Most of the surviving poor people were without clothing or food. Of the people concentrated in Jingcun, Luonan, twenty-two died of freezing in a major snowstorm. Having suffered such persecution, the people joined the guerrilla forces one after another.\n\nThe guerrilla forces have greatly developed, especially since the People's Liberation Army crossed the river south to conquer in August of last year, which gave the guerrilla forces a powerful boost. The guerrilla forces active in the Shangluo area along the Dan River launched ten active attacks on the enemy in November of last year alone, annihilating part of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops and local thugs, and capturing many strongholds. Under the support and protection of the guerrilla forces, the people in various places have further organized to settle accounts with Chiang's bandit henchmen and feudal exploitation. In a certain town, the masses settled accounts with the local tyrant Gao Laosi, and women and children actively participated in the struggle.\n\nXinhua News Agency,豫陕鄂 Frontline, 3rd of this month: In the Lushan and Baofeng areas, liberated peasants have armed themselves to protect their land. After a short-term training course for activists in a certain area, more than ninety people immediately and voluntarily formed an \"Armed Land Protection Brigade\" to protect the land reform struggle in their own village and other villages. They combined with the masses to launch the \"Three Searches\" movement (search for people, search for guns, search for things). The masses in a certain village brought back Zhao Lao Ba, a major despotic landlord who had been hiding in another village. Some villages found guns hidden by landlords in wells, blockhouses, and other places. In one village of more than fifty households in a certain administrative village, peasants had already found more than forty rifles hidden by the landlord. Villages have recovered a large amount of gold, silver, clothing and other items buried by landlords from caves and the wilderness.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反抗蒋胡匪并村烧杀  陕南人民挺身自救  在游击队保护下展开四抗运动\n\n1948-02-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    反抗蒋胡匪并村烧杀\n    陕南人民挺身自救\n    在游击队保护下展开四抗运动\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线三日电】陕南英勇不屈的人民在蒋胡匪“并村移民”的暴行下奋起自救，到处展开四抗（抗捕、抗税、抗丁、抗款）运动，游击队亦活跃于丹江两岸，予蒋胡匪以重大杀伤。去年十月间蒋胡匪又仿照日伪在伪满的“移民并村”办法，下令各山沟村庄居民一律移向蒋匪据点。人民纷起反抗，在大股蒋匪逼迫时逃往深山老林，对个别蒋匪爪牙则坚决抵抗，蒋胡匪乃下令焚毁村庄。这种暴行远在前年冬季就实行过，曾经一次焚毁了几百个村子，如蓝田以东地区由许家庙镇起，方圆五十里的几条川沟大小村庄都被烧光，一次被害人民就达三千五百户。又雒南以东，丹江北岸地区除灵丹庙等少数蒋胡匪据点外，东西一百二十余里，南北五十多里的地区都被焚毁。幸存的贫民大都无衣无食，被集中于雒南景村的人民，在一次大风雪中就冻死了二十二个。人民经此迫害，纷纷参加游击队。游击队得到很大的发展，尤其是去年八月解放军渡河南征，更予游游击队以有力的帮助。活跃丹江沿岸商雒地区的游击队仅在去年十一月间就主动袭敌十次，歼蒋胡匪及土顽等一部，并攻占据点多处。各地人民又在游击队的撑腰保护下，进一步组织起来，清算蒋匪爪牙及封建剥削。某镇群众清算了恶霸高老四，妇女小孩都积极卷入了斗争。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线三日电】鲁山、宝丰地区，翻身农民已武装起来保田。某地积极分子短期集训后，立即有九十多人自动组成“武装保田大队”，保护本村及外村的翻身斗争。他们结合群众发动“三找”运动（找人、找枪、找东西）。某村群众把隐藏在外村的大恶霸地主赵老八找回来。有的村庄从水井、炮楼等地方找出地主隐藏的枪支。某行政村一个五十多户的村庄里农民已找到地主隐藏的四十多支步枪，各村从地洞和野外找回地主埋藏的金银衣物等极多。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "From Workers and Peasants Back to Workers and Peasants\nReflections of Three District Cadres at the Taihang Sixth Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting\n\n    邢崇智 Reflects on False Reports\n    Comrade Xing Chongzhi is currently the secretary of the First District Committee of Shexian County. His family background is that of a new middle peasant. He has received some education and is currently 21 years old. He joined the Party in 1943 and started working in 1945.\n\n    Last spring, when working on cadre-mass relations, I went to ××× village wanting to make a splash and show off. I first mobilized poor and hired peasants to offer opinions on the cadres, but then I went to the cadres to comfort them, saying they would still be able to achieve merits in the future! I was trying to be a good person to both sides. Later, I forced the masses to discuss and award merits to the cadres, but the masses just couldn't seem to grasp my topic. The masses said: \"Cadre ××× shielded a landlord, that's no merit.\" I said: \"The cadre has already made a self-criticism regarding his shortcomings. We should only talk about the good points, not the bad points.\" In order to come up with something novel and show off, I asked a Party member to be active among the masses and suggest hanging \"Merit Plaques\" for the cadres. This was all something I forced the masses to do, but when I reported to the district, I said it was all voluntary and conscious on the part of the masses. When I wrote articles for the newspaper, I wrote it the same way.\n\n    When promoting production, conservation, and famine preparedness in ×× village, I thought to myself: ×× village is a model village, so I have to make it even more of a model. When helping the masses make conservation plans, I calculated 25 days as a month. Initially, I calculated half a jin of rice per person per day, but when that wasn't enough, I reduced it to six liang, and then to four liang. Only ten or so households in the whole village used scales to measure rice when they ate. I reported to the newspaper: \"Every household in ×× village uses scales to measure their rice at every meal.\" When attending a meeting in the county, I wanted to compile my work achievements to report, so I just estimated a number. To make it believable, I deliberately made the number have both whole and fractional parts. I also wrote articles for the newspaper.\n\n    The ×× village branch secretary is a lazy person. After picking up manure twice, I said he had turned around. Comrade ××, a Party member, was originally very lax in his position, but during the \"July 1st\" public Party day, in order to cater to the materials wanted by the higher-ups, I wrote that he was a model Party member and published it in the newspaper. In my work, I often used the typical materials from a few villages to represent the entire district's situation, turning slogans into actual actions. I deceived Lao Qiao (the district secretary at the time) when I went to the district. Lao Qiao took it to the county and deceived the county committee. The county committee said that the work in the First District wasn't bad, and the district cadres also said I was capable. I was completely trying to cater to the psychology of the higher-ups, hoping to be seen and promoted.\n\n    杜进 Reflects on Punishing Poor and Hired Peasants\n    Comrade Du Jin is in charge of propaganda for the Shahe sub-committee. His family background is poor peasant, and he worked as a hired laborer. He joined the Party in August 1940 and left home to work in 1943.\n\n    When working in ×× village, I initially found that the village chief, the head of the Armed Forces Committee, and the militia captain were all rich peasants. But the Party members listened to them. When I asked who were the landlords and rich peasants, they replied: \"Our village doesn't have any big households. Only one household lives in ×× village in ×× county, with over one qing of land.\" So, I mobilized the cadres, poor and hired peasants to struggle against him. The distribution of fruits of struggle was only discussed at a branch meeting. At the meeting, Party members competed to divide the fruits of struggle among themselves. Only some grain was left and given to some people who hadn't worked in the village in the past. The poor and hired peasants didn't get anything, so they were dissatisfied and opposed it. After that, the poor and hired peasants didn't go to the meetings anymore. The village chief, the head of the Armed Forces Committee, and the militia captain said to me: \"You don't understand the situation. People in our village won't go unless they are punished.\" So, I discussed it with them and decided that whoever didn't come would be fined one jin of oil. At the evening meeting, the village cadres and activists came early to be counted. Rich peasants and middle peasants all came, but the poor and hired peasants and bachelors didn't come. Twenty poor and hired peasants were fined, totaling twenty jin of oil, as village office expenses. At the time, I thought it was very right. Now, reflecting on it, I completely followed the landlord and rich peasant line.\n\n    There was a poor and hired peasant named ×× in ×× village. He didn't get any land in the rent reduction and land reform movement and was so hungry that he stole a radish and a handful of cowpeas from a rich peasant's field. The landlord saw him and wouldn't let it go, so I detained him. I didn't consider why he stole from others, I just said stealing was wrong. After discussing it with several cadres, we fined him. But then we beat him up and paraded him through the streets. In the past, landlords had watchdogs. Now, I ate and drank the poor and hired peasants' food and became a watchdog for the landlords and rich peasants, beating and punishing the poor and hired peasants, not thinking from their perspective.\n\n    The movement in ×× village started very enthusiastically. When struggling against the big businessman landlord ×××, the masses hated him and wanted to struggle against him. But his son was the political director of our troops. During the struggle, a letter came saying a bunch of polite things. There were many landlords and rich peasants among the village cadres, and few poor and hired peasants. After receiving the letter, they came to me and said: \"×××'s son is our cadre, we should take care of him, it's not right to struggle against him.\" I also thought that he was a director and a Party member and shouldn't be struggled against, so I went to the peasant association to explain: \"It's right to offer opinions on ×××, but his son is serving as a political director in the army, his family is an anti-Japanese family, don't struggle against him.\" The masses didn't say anything. I then said: \"Think about it, if we struggle against him, who is his son fighting for on the front lines?\" The masses were even more silent. I then said: \"If we struggle against him, he is a counter-revolutionary.\" I used these words to suppress the masses. Now I reflect on who is the counter-revolutionary? It is I who is with the feudal forces as a counter-revolutionary, not the masses. I was supporting the landlords and rich peasants to attack the poor and hired peasants. Now I understand, I really was suppressing and attacking the poor and hired peasants.\n\n    刘士保 Reflects on Distributing Too Many Fruits of Struggle\n    Comrade Liu Shibao is currently in charge of propaganda for the Shexian sub-committee. He comes from a poor peasant family. He joined the Party in 1945 and only started working in the district in 1946.\n\n    I was born a poor peasant, but I turned myself around in the Double Reduction movement. In 1945, I became a middle peasant. Last year, during the movement, I went to the district to become a cadre. I was very satisfied with the May 4th Directive because although my family had land, we still had very little furniture and no house. If we carried out land reform, I could still get something. In 1946, during the land reform movement, I was assigned to work in ×× village. After a major struggle in my village, the village cadres sent someone to call me back to help distribute the fruits of struggle. At that time, I was leading the masses in struggle in ×× village. I thought: \"Should I go back? I can't put down the work here. If I don't go back, I'm afraid I won't get any fruits of struggle, or they'll give me less.\" For my own benefit, I decided not to lead the masses and went home to distribute the fruits of struggle. Before distributing the fruits of struggle, we first discussed it in the branch. The village cadres and I unanimously agreed that we should give more to the Party members, because if the Party members got more, I could get more too. I said at the branch meeting: \"We've led the struggle for several years, this year we have to really turn ourselves around!\" I suggested that Party members report what they needed first, because if I asked them to report first, they would also ask me to report, so I could get what I wanted. After everyone reported, when it was my turn to report, I said: I want a house, good bedding, and other furniture, etc. I thought, I'm a worker! I have to get a good quilt! I wasn't sure if I'd get what I wanted, so I proposed that Party members should make up two-thirds of the evaluation committee, so I could feel at ease. After I left, the village cadres went to the masses and educated them in the same way I did. They told the masses: \"This year's distribution of the fruits of struggle will be based on merit.\" So, the first place was me, because I was selfish and influenced the village cadres, they used my name to distribute more fruits of struggle. When I went back and saw that I had been given a good house, tables, chairs, and a small donkey was exchanged for half a horse, I was still satisfied. But I was not satisfied with a coarse cloth quilt that was distributed to me. The masses told me: \"The village cadres used your name to distribute more fruits of struggle.\" So, I was dissatisfied with the village cadres and went to the masses and said: \"The village cadres distributed more fruits of struggle, we have to report it to the district.\" The masses reported it to the district, and the district secretary called me back to correct the fruits of struggle. I called three mass meetings, but only a few people came. I seized on this point to scold the cadres. Compared to the poor and hired peasants, I also distributed too many fruits of struggle. My purpose in mobilizing the masses was not to distribute the fruits of struggle well, but because I was not satisfied with the fruits of struggle distributed to me, I was retaliating against the village cadres. So, when returning the fruits of struggle, the village cadres only returned some tables and chairs, I returned half a horse, and took back my donkey, and then there was no more return. Because if we returned any more, I would have to return it too! So, the fruits of struggle were not returned thoroughly, I shielded the village cadres.\n\n    My family has three people and eleven mu of land. Counting by population, my family has the most land in the whole village. But I don't have any labor power myself. The village farms it for me and I have to pay half the wages. Having a lot of land means a heavy burden, and I thought that planting some land wasn't enough to give to others. So, I asked the village cadres to sell my land. I wanted to sell the bad land and only plant the good land. When I was studying at the prefectural committee, I heard that the land was going to be equally distributed. I was not satisfied because if I had a lot of land, and we were going to distribute land equally, I would have to give it away. After returning to the village, the village cadres did not sell my land for me, I was not satisfied, so I actively sold the land. As a result, I sold two mu of land for 40,000 ocean. I wanted to sell the land and put the money into the store, to earn pure profits, which was better than farming, and it wouldn't be equally distributed, so I developed exploitative thoughts. But after I sold the land, the masses said: \"People in Linxian County sold land after they heard the news at the meeting.\" They also said: \"He is a district cadre, if we knew, we would sell the land too, and be able to distribute it.\" After the Land Law Outline was published in the newspaper, the village cadres complained about me, complaining that I didn't tell them.\n\n    My small old donkey couldn't travel long distances. Every time I calculated travel expenses, I took out rice. There was no one at home to cut grass. I wanted to sell it, save the rice for travel, and be able to spend the money, so I sold it for 30,000 ocean. Together with the land sale, it was 70,000 ocean. I put 40,000 into the cooperative and used the remaining money to buy good quilts and blankets to build myself up. I thought that my personal belongings couldn't be equally distributed, and if I dressed well, others would look up to me. When I worked, I shouted to the masses every day to save, but when I went home, I ate white flour every day, with eggs, and didn't even want to eat rice.\n\n    When I was working in ××, I also pretended at first, calling for sending food to the poor and hired peasants' homes. But after the people who were sent ate one meal, and I saw that their houses were so dirty, I pretended to be sick and didn't go anymore.\n\n    Although I am from a working background, after I turned myself around, I forgot about the poor and hired peasants. I completely degenerated, without any poor and hired peasant perspective, taking advantage of opportunities, sabotaging equal distribution. If everyone was like me, the land reform would not be thorough.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 来自工农回到工农  太行六地委整党会上三个区干部的反省\n\n1948-02-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    来自工农回到工农\n    太行六地委整党会上三个区干部的反省 \n    邢崇智反省假报告\n    邢同志现任涉县一区分委书记，家庭成份是新中农，读过书，现在二十一岁，一九四三年入党，一九四五年参加工作。\n    去年春天，搞干群关系时，我到×××村想搞一手，显示自己。先发动贫雇给干部提意见，但又去干部那里安慰干部，说以后还要立功哩！这样两面为好人。到后来硬叫群众讨论，给干部立功，群众怎样也讨论不到我的题目上。群众说：“干部×××包庇地主没有功。”我说：“缺点，干部已经检讨过了，光准说优点，不准说缺点。”并为了弄个花样，表现自己，我叫一个党员到群众中活动，提意见，给干部挂“功劳匾”。这本是我强制群众搞的，到区上汇报，都是说是群众自觉自愿的，并向报纸写稿，也是这样写。\n    在××村搞生产节约备荒时，我心想：××村是个模范村，总要叫他更模范些。在帮助群众订节约计划时，二十五天也算成一月，开始每人一天以半斤米计算，不够又降到六两，又降到四两。全村只有十来户用秤秤米吃的，我就向报纸报导：“××村家家每顿吃米用秤秤。”到县开会时，我想把工作成绩统计起来汇报，于是就估计了个数目字，并为了使人相信，故意估计成有整有零的数，并向报纸写了稿子。\n    ××村支书，是个懒汉，拾了二次粪，就说他转变了。党员××同志本来立场很马虎，在“七一”公开党时，为了迎合上级要的材料，就写成他是模范党员，登在报上。在工作中，常常是以几个村的典型材料，写成全区情况，把口号写成实际行动。我到区上欺骗老乔（当时区书），老乔带到县上，欺骗县委。县委说，一区工作不坏，区干部也说我能干。我完全是为了迎合上级心理，希望看起自己，提拔自己。\n    杜进反省处罚贫雇\n    杜同志是沙河分委宣传，家庭是贫农，当过雇工，一九四○年八月入党，一九四三年离家工作。\n    在××村工作，开始找着村长、武委会主任、民兵队长都是富农，但是党员听了他们的话，当问谁是地主富农，回答说：“咱村就没大户，只有一户是在××县的××村住着，有一顷多地。”就发动干部、贫雇将他斗了。分果实只是开了个支部会研究，会上是党员互相争分果实，只留了一些粮食，给了一些过去在村上不劳动的人，贫雇一点没分，就不满反对，以后贫雇开会就不去了。村长、武委会主任、民兵队长对我说：“你不了解情况，我村群众不罚就不去。”我就与他们商量了，决定谁不到罚油一斤。晚上开会，村干部和积极分子，先到就点名，富农、中农都到，贫雇和光棍汉没到，一点名罚了二十个贫雇，共二十斤油，作为村办公费。当时我认为很对，现在反省，完全走了地主富农路线。\n    ××村有个××是贫雇，在减租土地改革中，没得到地，饿的没法，到地偷了富农一个萝卜、一把豆角。被地主见了不行，我就把他扣起来，没有考虑为啥偷人家的，光说偷不对，与几个干部商量了一下，罚他没有啥，就把人家打了一顿，又叫游街。过去地主有看门狗，现在我吃了喝了贫雇的，去当地主富农的看门狗，打贫雇，罚贫雇，没有从贫雇着想。\n    ××村开始运动搞得非常热烈，斗争大经营地主×××时，群众对他仇恨，要斗他，但他儿子是咱们部队的政治主任，正斗争时，来了一信，说了一套客气话。村干部中破落地主富农成份多，贫雇少，接到信后找我说：“×××儿子是咱们干部，要照顾人家，斗争人家不对。”我思想亦觉得人家是个主任，是党员，不应斗，就去农会中解释说：“对×××提意见是对的，但他儿是在部队当政治主任，他家是抗属不要斗。”群众不吭，我又说：“大家想想，要斗了，人家儿子在前方为谁去的？”群众更不吭，我又说：“斗了人家是反革命。”用这话压制群众。这次我反省究竟谁反革命？是我和封建势力在一起反革命，不是群众反革命，是给地主富农撑腰来打击贫雇。我这时清楚了，我真是压制打击贫雇。\n    刘士保反省多分果实\n    刘同志现任涉县分委宣传，贫农成分，一九四五年入党，一九四六年才到区上工作。\n    我是贫农出身，但在双减运动中，就翻了身。一九四五年成了中农。去年运动，我就到区上当干部。五四指示，我很满意，因为我家虽然有了土地，但家具还很少，也没有房子，要是进行土地改革，我还能分到东西。一九四六年土地改革运动时，分配我到××村工作，我村大斗争过后，村干部派人去叫我回去，帮助分果实，这时我正在××村领导群众斗争，我想：“回去吧？这里工作放不下，不回去，怕不分给自己果实，或者叫我少分。”为了自己利益，还是不领导群众，回家去分果实。在分果实前，先在支部讨论，我和村干部一致意见，愿意叫党员多分，因为党员多分，自己也能多分。我在支部会上说：“咱领导斗争几年了，今年可要好好翻身哩！”我出主张，先叫党员自报，自己需要什么？因为我叫他们自报，他们也要叫我自报，可以得到满意。大家报完，叫我报时，我说：我要房子，好铺盖，和其他家具等。我想，我当工作员哩！可得分个好被子哩！我提出自己的要求，恐怕不保险，又提议评议员中，党员要占三分之二，这样我才放了心。我走后，村干部到群众中，还是照我那样去教育群众，他们给群众说：“今年分果实，要按功劳分。”因此第一名就是我，因为我自私自利，影响了村干部，他们借我的名，多分果实。我回去一看，我分上了好房子，桌椅条杌，一个小驴换了半个马，这我还都满意，但分给我一个粗布夹被子我不满。群众给我说：“村干部借我的名，多分了果实。”因此我对村干部不满，就到群众中活动说：“村干部多分了果实，要向区反映。”群众反映到区，区书叫我回去，纠正果实，我召集了三次群众会，只去了几个人，我就抓住这一点训干部。我比起贫雇，也多分果实，我发动群众目的，不是想把果实分好，而是因给我分的果实不满我的意，向村干部报复。所以到退果实时，村干部只退出些桌椅板凳，我退出半个马，收回我的驴，就再没有退。因为再退的话，我也得退哩！所以果实没退彻底，我包庇了村干部。\n    我家三口人，十一亩地，按人口算，全村数我地多。但我自己没劳力，村上代耕，还得出一半工资。地多出负担又重，我想种些地还不够给人家哩，因此我就叫村干部给我卖地。我想把坏地卖了，光种好地打算。在地委学习时，听说要平分土地，我不满意，因为我地多了，要平分，我还得往外拿。回村后，村干部没有给我卖了地，我不满，就积极卖地，结果卖了二亩地，洋四万元。我想卖了地，把钱入到商店，净赚红利，比种地强，也平分不了，自己产生了剥削思想。但我卖地后，群众说：“人家在林县开会，听到消息才卖地。”又说：“人家当区干部哩，咱要知道，咱也要卖地哩，卖了地，还能分。”报上登出土地法大纲后，村干部瞒怨我，嫌我不对他们说。\n    我一个小老驴，不能出长差，每次算差帐，往出拿米，家里又没人割草，我想卖了它，省的出差出米，又能花钱，又卖了洋三万元，连卖地共七万元，入到合作社四万元，留下的钱，自己买了好被子、毯子，来建设自己。我想我个人东西，啥也平分不了，并且穿的好了，叫别人看起我。我做工作，每天对群众喊叫节约，我回家成天吃白面，还配鸡蛋，米都不想吃。\n    我在××工作时，开始也是装腔作势，叫往贫雇家派饭，但派的吃了一顿饭，看他家脏的不行，就装病不去了。\n    我虽是劳动出身，但自己翻身后，忘了贫雇，完全蜕化，没有一点贫雇观点，投机取巧，破坏平分，要都象我这样，土地改革就不能彻底。"

    "content": "Shexian and Licheng are actively preparing to deeply promote the Outline Land Law during the New Year entertainment. To train propagandists for the New Year entertainment, Shexian recently convened a meeting of blind people and those who can recite ballads. They studied and discussed the Land Law and the new situation this year, and created propaganda materials such as ballads. They were divided into four groups: one group discussed the general spirit of the Outline Land Law, one group discussed the origins of the Land Law and various specific issues, one group discussed major world events, and one group specifically discussed the new situation. Everyone is now writing and singing their own material, with cadres helping to write it down. After it is completed, they plan to perform it in the city first, and after being reviewed by the masses and collecting opinions for revision, they will go back to their respective areas to promote it. The urban school district of Licheng also held a teachers' meeting on the 28th of last month to discuss how to deeply promote the Land Law and the victorious situation of the Taihang counter-offensive this year during the Lunar New Year. It was unanimously decided that new dramas should be performed by existing troupes in various villages, and various forms such as Yangko and Xiaohua Opera should be used to expand publicity. It was also decided to organize a large number of artists from the masses to create works, collect folk songs spontaneously circulating among the masses, and cultivate new Li Youcais. The meeting specifically decided that the main focus of preparation should be on children, and the masses can participate voluntarily at that time. Simple economy should be promoted, and extravagance and waste should be opposed. After the meeting, the main village in the city immediately convened a meeting of actors and artists from the rural theater troupes to discuss the matter. An entertainment and propaganda committee was established on the spot, and it was divided into two groups for preparation: one group was responsible for writing and creation, with the participation of teachers, actors, and artists; the other group was responsible for free teaching and preparing to organize the masses. The children in Beifang and Dongguan have now learned many newly composed Land Law songs.\n\n\t[Taihang News] In the process of preparing for the New Year entertainment, Yuanshi and Xiyang discovered that some village cadres, ignoring the urgent production needs of the masses, forced the organization of drama performances and indulged in extravagance and waste, increasing the burden on the masses. The wasteland reclamation in Nan'zuo and Northeast Village of Yuanshi is serious, and the masses are urgently demanding production to overcome the famine. In particular, poor and hired peasants have many production difficulties, but the village cadres simply ignore this, and only organize young women to perform dramas and make entertainment every day, even performing until midnight and not being able to go back, which has caused family dissatisfaction. At the same time, they also forced women who do not perform in dramas to spin three liang of cotton for each woman who performs in dramas without any compensation, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of women, especially poor and hired women, affecting their willingness to spin cotton. The militia instructor of Beizhangcheng in Xiyang also led a group of young men and women to run a theater troupe every night, and also \"mobilized\" (that is, forced) twenty catties of oil from the masses. The masses are very dissatisfied with this behavior and demand that it be corrected immediately.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 涉县、黎城  集训盲人艺人  准备年关娱乐\n\n1948-02-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    涉县、黎城\n    集训盲人艺人  准备年关娱乐\n    【太行消息】涉县、黎城正积极准备在年关娱乐中，深入宣传土地法大纲。涉县为了集训年关娱乐中的宣传员，最近召集一批盲人和会说鼓词的人开会，一面讨论学习，了解土地法和今年的新形势，一面创作鼓词等宣传材料。一共分了四个组，一组是讨论宣传土地法大纲的总精神，一组是讨论宣传土地法来源和各种具体问题，一组是讨论宣传天下大事，一组是专门讨论宣传新形势。现在大家正在自编自唱，由干部执笔帮助。编好后，还准备先在城里演唱一下，经群众审查，搜集意见修改后，再分头回去搞。黎城城里学区也在上月二十八日召开教员会，讨论旧历年关如何深入宣传土地法和今年太反攻的胜利形势。一致决定：要利用各村旧有的剧团演新剧，利用秧歌、小花戏等多种多样的形式来扩大宣传，并要大批组织群众中的艺人进行创作，搜集群众中自发流行的歌谣，培养新的李有才。会上特别决定：平时准备主要是儿童，到时群众可自愿参加。要提倡简单节约，反对铺张浪费。会后，城里主村马上召集在乡剧团演员和艺人开会讨论，当场并成立起娱乐宣传委员会，共分两伙伙准备：一伙是编写创作，由教员、演员、艺人参加；一伙是义教负责，准备组织群众搞。北纺、东关的儿童现在已经学会好多新编的土地法歌子。\n    【太行消息】元氏、昔阳在准备年关娱乐当中，发现有些村干部不顾群众迫切的生产要求，强迫组织演剧，并铺张浪费，加重群众负担。元氏南佐、东北村灭荒严重，群众迫切要求生产渡荒，特别是贫雇农生产困难很多，但该村干部根本不管，只是天天组织青年妇女演剧闹娱乐，甚至演到半夜还不能回去，更引起家庭不满。同时，还强迫不演剧的妇女，毫无代价的给每个演剧妇女代纺三两花，引起广大妇女特别是贫雇妇女的不满，影响她们不愿意纺花。昔阳北掌城民兵指导员，也领着一伙青年男女，每天晚上搞剧团，还向群众“动员”（就是强迫）了二十斤油。群众对这种行为很不满意，要求马上加以纠正。"

    "content": "【Taihang News】The old lunar year is almost here, and the students of the families' school for southern-bound cadres in Shexian County are writing letters to the Taihang Xinhua Daily, hoping to convey their inner thoughts to their relatives far away in the South. They hope that they will be able to put their minds at ease in the front to kill the enemy, help the poor people in the South to turn over, and strive to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. Zhao Jiuzhou and Hao Peilan, the principal and comrade of the school, said in their letters: \"Comrades of the Southern Expedition Cadres: We are very happy to see the news of your victory after you went south in the newspaper. How are you all! Since you left, our county's work-study school has been immediately changed to a family member's school for southern-bound cadres. In order to further take care of the study of your loved ones, it has been decided to provide full public funding for three months, half public funding for three months, and one-quarter supply for six months, for a total of one year of residence before graduation. It is also allowed to bring children under the age of five, and one child will receive one jin of wheat per day. The public also provides medical expenses. The school mainly focuses on learning textile technology, and also improves everyone politically and culturally. When school started, we personally went to your homes, partly to express our condolences and partly to mobilize your loved ones to participate in learning. After arriving at the school, in addition to learning some textile technology, everyone politically saw their bright future and overcame the temporary anxiety that arose after you left. Culturally, everyone learned dozens of words in more than a month, and the most learned seventy or eighty words. During the holidays, models were also selected, and the loved ones of comrades Zhang Ruqing and Zhang Jingyuan were elected as models for the whole school, and everyone was in a very good mood. We hope you can work with peace of mind in the front and work hard to help the poor people there to turn over. In the rear, we must cultivate them well so that they can be self-reliant, which is our gift to you.\"\n\n    The students wrote many letters to their relatives. Wang Gaizhong said in her letter to Comrade Zhang Ruqing: \"Comrade Ruqing: The village and district in our family are taking good care of us. The grain harvested in autumn is enough to eat, and the tobacco leaves alone sold for over 100,000, so there is no difficulty. Our Mao Sheng and Qiulan children are both in school in winter, and the third uncle was also elected as a model in the mutual aid group in autumn. Now the New Year's goods are all prepared. Three dou of wheat and two dou of corn have been milled, so there is no need to worry about anything at home. I came to the school on September 15th. At first, I didn't like it very much, but then it got better. I realized my future and decided to study hard, planning to learn skills when crossing the river so that I can be independent in life. I hope you will do a good job in the front and be a model. I will also study hard and work hard to move forward. And I wish you a happy New Year!\"\n\n    Sun Dongzhi said in her letter to Comrade Zhang Jingyuan: \"Comrade Jingyuan: How are you? When I came to the school, I didn't know anyone at first, but later I got to know everyone. I felt that being with my classmates was like being at home. We are going to have a holiday for the New Year and go back. I will also prepare to learn to knit Western socks and belts, and continue to engage in production. Recently, I took a photo with the child, and it's very good. The child is chubby. When we can communicate, I will send it to you. Also, our family is doing well. The wheat has been planted early, so don't worry, and I hope you can help the poor people there to turn over.\"\n\n    Du Yulin wrote in her letter to Comrade Liu Xianlu: \"Comrade Xianlu: I have received your previous two letters, so don't worry. My illness is cured, and after autumn, I went to school. This time I am very at ease and determined to work hard, not like before! I hope you will pay attention to taking care of your health and strive for progress in your work.\"\n\n    Zhang Hua'e said in her letter to Comrade Du Shuanghe: \"Comrade Shuanghe: How is your health after crossing the river? Now the masses in our village are taking care of us very well, and the autumn harvest was not bad. My sister and I went to the school together. The principal and the teachers treat us very well, so don't worry. You can work with peace of mind in the front, and I will study hard in the back, so that we can be reunited in the future.

    "content": "Criticism and Suggestions\n\n    To the Editor:\n    On the 23rd, it was snowing heavily and the weather was very cold. A logistics regiment of a certain unit, with 22 people and 22 animals, stayed in our village. When the village cadres saw their own troops coming, they immediately looked for accommodation. Before the houses were found, they took action themselves and arbitrarily claimed houses, with a very bad attitude. Of course, the weather was too cold, and it was inevitable that they were anxious, so we can't blame them. But when they found the house of Wang Guoming, a military dependent, whose family consisted of five people, including his wife, children, and an ox, the whole family pleaded with the platoon leader to ask the village cadres to help them find another place to live. The platoon leader's reply was threatening, and he seemed to want to beat and scold them, saying, \"This place is really stubborn!\" This frightened the whole family into silence. They also dragged their ox into the snowy yard and fed their animals inside the house. Later, platoon leader Xu Qianzhi, with a furious face, asked the village cadres for grass, and said, \"I give you three minutes to chop it and send it over.\" This frightened the village cadres so much that they had to chop it themselves, and in their haste, they chopped a piece of their hand, and bled a lot. In the evening, they also wanted 31 quilts, saying that they wouldn't do with one less. The village head was very embarrassed. The platoon leader said, \"Your village cadres don't care about us and are not responsible.\" After a lot of talk, they went to the homes of the people themselves to find quilts. One woman only had one quilt, but they forced her to take it away. The village cadres estimated that each person had one quilt, and since there were only 22 people in the unit, it was unreasonable to ask for 31. They planned to find one for each of them. But they insisted on having 31, and it was only after much persuasion that they gave up.\n    They stayed for two nights. When they left, they settled the accounts for rice and fodder. The rice they ate was paid for, which was relatively reasonable. But they used 462 catties of grass, and only paid ten yuan per catty (the local market price is 33 yuan per catty). We would like to ask the editor how this should be handled according to the regulations. After they left, the masses all said: \"We heard in winter school that the army and the people should unite, so why are there still such troops in the Eighth Route Army?\" This letter also represents the opinions of the masses. We hope the editor will answer it.\n    Zhang Lide, Winter School Reading Group, Xiangshan Village, Tenth District, Cixian County. January 28th.\n    The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people. They shed blood and sweat to fight the Chiang bandits in order to protect the people and help them to turn over. The people also support them, so the army and the people are united. However, there are also a few people in the People's Liberation Army who have shortcomings and do not abide by mass discipline, causing friction with the people, like the platoon leader of the logistics regiment in this case. The people should supervise and report these people, and the leaders of the troops should inspect and educate them. Of course, the people's grass should be paid for at the market price. It is wrong to pay less.\n——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 磁县香山村群众提意见  请辎重团检查群众纪律\n\n1948-02-05\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n    磁县香山村群众提意见  请辎重团检查群众纪律编辑同志：\n    二十三号那天，大雪纷飞天气很冷，某部辎重团廿二人，牵牲口二十二头，住在敝村。村干部看见自己的队伍来了，就马上找住址。不等房子找下，他们自己动手、随便号了房子，态度很坏。当然天气太冷，免不了着急，也不能怪他们。但他们找到抗属王国名家，他家妻子老小共五口，有一头牛，全家都恳求排长，想叫村干部帮他们另找房住，排长的答复很象威胁，似乎还想打骂，说：“这地方真顽固！”吓得他全家不敢吭声。又把他家的牛拉在雪院，把他们的牲口喂到房里。后来，排长许阡芝满面怒容向村干部要草，并且说：“限三分钟铡好送来。”吓的村干部只得亲自去铡，慌的连手都铡了一块，流了很多血。到了晚上又要被子三十一条，说少一条也不行。村长很作难。排长说：“你们村干部对我们不关心，不负责任。”谈了一大堆，他们又自己到老百姓家里找被子，有一户女人只一条被子，也强迫着拿走了。村干部估计每人一条被子，队伍只有二十二人，要三十一条不合理，打算替他们每人找一条。但他们非要三十一条不行，后来说了多少好话才算了。\n    住了两夜，临走时算米票草料帐，米吃的给的，比较合理。但用了四百六十二斤草，每斤只按十元发（当地行市每斤是三十三元），究竟按制度该怎么办，请编者答复一下。他们走后，群众都说：冬学里听报，说军民团结，为什么八路军还有这样的队伍呢？这个信的意见也是群众要求，请编辑回答为盼。\n    磁县十区香山村冬学读报组张立德  一月二十八日\n    解放军是老百姓的队伍，他为保护老百姓翻身，流血流汗打蒋匪。老百姓也拥护他，所以军民是团结的。但是解放军里也有少数有缺点的人，不遵守群众纪律，和老百姓闹蹩扭，象辎重团排长这个样子。老百姓对这些人应该监督告发，队伍上的负责人应该检查教育。用了老百姓的草，当然应该按市价付钱，少给了是不对的。            ——编者"

    "content": "How the \"Free\" United States Received Me\nby Gao Niechuk\nTranslated by Luo Fen\n\nWhen I was invited to attend the Slavic Congress in the United States, I happily agreed. As a Soviet writer (namely, the author of the play \"The Front\"—Editor), I was eager to see the life and customs of the great country across the ocean and to convey my heartfelt respect to the American people on behalf of my great motherland.\n\nAs soon as the news of the Soviet delegation's visit to the United States spread, I received numerous telegrams—various social organizations inviting me to visit and to give reports on Soviet literature.\n\nI agreed to all the invitations. I wanted to meet as many people as possible, hear their opinions, and tell them the truth about our country.\n\nWe flew from Moscow, passing through Berlin and London. Then we transferred to the steamer \"@Meli\" for a two-day voyage to New York. I was eager to see America from the sea—the skyscrapers of the smog-shrouded metropolis and the famous \"Statue of Liberty\" I had only seen in American movies. But en route, the captain received a radio message stating that the dockworkers in New York were on strike. Our steamer had to change course and head for the Canadian port of Halifax.\n\nFrom Halifax to New York, we traveled by train.\n\nNear the hotel where we were to stay, thousands of Americans had gathered. They had originally intended to greet our delegation at the station, making numerous phone calls to inquire about the arrival time of our train, but to no avail. Thus, due to the peculiar \"accuracy\" of the American railways, the welcome for the Soviet delegation was aborted.\n\nThe next morning, I was picked up and taken to the Soviet Consulate. There, I found a large pile of letters addressed to me. Various social organizations were calling me—wanting me to give speeches. \"If you accepted all the invitations, you would need two months, speaking twice a day,\" the Consul told me. \"I understand this is a great burden, but there is an agency trying to prevent you from speaking.\"\n\nThe United States Department of Justice showed such touching concern for me. Even several days before my arrival in the United States, this Department of Justice sent me a letter warning that if I did not register as a foreign agent and provide fingerprints, I would be punished as a criminal.\n\nA similar letter was sent to Wanda Wasilewska, who had originally planned to come with us.\n\nNo, I don't believe it! During the war years, the Americans I met in Moscow told me so much about American democracy. They invited me to their country and emphasized that I would be their honored guest. They praised my screenplay \"Mission to Moscow,\" calling it a work that helped my two great nations understand and approach each other.\n\nI read the letters one by one again.\n\nDear Mr. Korneichuk: The literary symposium is scheduled for Monday evening... The chairman is Professor Simon Poulson of Columbia University.\n\n\"We have three Americans speaking, all leading figures in the literary world. Our proposed program is as follows: Your speech, along with translation, will take one hour. The remaining hour will be for questions and discussion...\"\n\nDear Dr. Korneichuk: Please attend a most prestigious conference to be held at Brighton University.\n\n\"As you may know, Brighton University celebrated its bicentennial in 1946... Of the six conferences, one will be of particular interest to you—its main topic is: The Humanitarian Tradition of the Future Century. Your presence will give special pleasure to the 'Humanitarian Tradition' committee and will strengthen our belief that this conference will be recognized as a cultural milestone in improving American education.\n\nSincerely, A. Staffiel, Chairman of the 'Humanitarian Tradition of the Future Century' Conference.\"\n\n\"The Humanitarian Tradition of the Future Century\": what a noble sound! But before me lay an official piece of white paper concisely written in black English—register as an agent, or we will throw you in jail, put your fingerprints on it, or we will throw you in jail. But if you really register and try to speak somewhere, a young police officer will quickly come to you: \"Listen, you foreign agent, get in the paddy wagon.\"\n\nThe phone rang, and the Consul picked up the receiver.\n\n\"The people are asking about you. They are inviting you to speak tomorrow.\"\n\n\"No,\" I interrupted him, \"get me a car.\"\n\n\"Where do you want to go?\"\n\n\"I want to see the Statue of Liberty.\"\n\nAn hour later, I was already on the dock. In the distance, facing away from America, stood the Statue of Liberty. On the shore were hundreds upon hundreds of sailors; they were pacing back and forth nine steps at a time. Each person held a sign that read: \"We are on strike, we demand humane living conditions...\"\n\nIn the evening, about 20,000 people gathered in the \"Madison Square Garden\" hall.\n\nWhen our delegation entered the guest seating area, everyone stood up and warmly greeted the guests from the Soviet nation. In this moment of excitement, we forgot about the letter from the U.S. Department of Justice. We saw, we felt, that even the most outrageous slanders against the Soviet Union could not shake the great prestige of the Soviet people in the eyes of the American people. When the chairman read Comrade Stalin's congratulatory message to the Slavic Congress, the walls seemed to be shaken by the applause and cheers of the 20,000-person gathering. We experienced an unforgettable moment.\n\nAfter the U.S. Department of Justice issued its warning, I notified all the social organizations that had invited me to speak. I told them that, according to American \"democratic\" laws, guests from the Soviet Union would be imprisoned for giving speeches, and due to these unfortunate circumstances, I regrettably had to decline all the enthusiastic invitations.\n\nI limited my activities in the United States to: giving three-minute speeches at various gatherings in New York and other cities, conveying the heartfelt greetings of the Soviet people to the American people, and thanking them for their assistance in the fight against fascism.\n\nI was determined to abide by the laws of the country where I was temporarily residing. After all, as the saying goes: greeting and thanking are innocent. But that was not the case, and I received another threatening letter:\n\n\"...The Department of Justice has written to you, requiring you to register as a foreign agent. Therefore, we suggest that you do so immediately to avoid our use of coercive measures...\"\n\nTwo days later, a third letter arrived, warning that, according to the law, I was already at risk of being sentenced to two years in prison and fined $1,000.\n\nTo put it mildly, I was already feeling somewhat suffocated in the \"free\" United States, so I decided to return home immediately.\n\nBefore departing, we went to Hyde Park to lay a wreath at F. Roosevelt's tomb. We paid our respects to the remains of this great son of the American people, whose ideals were buried by the current rulers of the United States on the day he died. We were invited to visit the former president's house and museum. The museum contained gifts given to Roosevelt from almost every country in the world. On the walls were many photos: Roosevelt awarding American medals to officers and soldiers of the Allied forces. But there was not a single photo of the president awarding medals to Soviet aviators and sailors. In the center of the photos was a photo of Roosevelt and Churchill together, but there was not a single photo of Roosevelt with Stalin. There was nothing in the museum related to the Soviet Union, the great ally of the United States in the fight against fascism.\n\nI asked the museum curator: \"Why are there no photos of Roosevelt with Stalin? Their historic meeting was known throughout the world.\"\n\nHe replied: \"There were some at first, but they were all taken away later for some reason.\"\n\nHis face turned red.\n\nEven in such sacred things to the American people as the Roosevelt Museum, the dirty claws of American fascists had destroyed all that reflected the best and greatest things in history during the days of the great trial of all the freedom-loving nations of the world.\n\nIn the \"free\" United States, neither the threats of the Department of Justice nor the rude slanders spread by various reactionary newspapers pointing fingers at my name insulted me as much as the shameless fabrication of history in the Roosevelt Museum.\n\nBut it would be unfair to say that there is no \"freedom\" at all in the present-day United States. I saw a parade in downtown New York City, made up of Polish fascists. At the head of the procession was a truck carrying a woman dressed in white, with a crown of thorns on her head. Next to her sat gentlemen disguised as pregnant bellies, wearing gloves and ragged clothes. They were dressed as Polish \"peasants,\" and the woman in white was \"Poland.\" Opposite the woman stood a young man dressed as a Red Army soldier, roughly made up in the style of Kuzma Kryuchkov, holding a bayonet aimed at the woman's chest. On the roof of the car was a cloth banner that read: \"Save Poland from the clutches of the Bolsheviks.\"\n\nDozens of bands shook the whole of New York City. Drummers wearing Polish costumes stirred up an unbelievable uproar, and mounted and foot police protected this anti-Soviet, anti-Polish democratic government demonstration.\n\nGoebbels himself would have admired the slogan written on that banner.\n\nAll this was carried out with the permission and close protection of the American government.\n\nAlong with these Polish fascists walked their American bosses. These bosses smiled happily, patting their servants on the shoulders.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that if the tens of thousands of Polish workers in Detroit—whose delegation asked me to convey their warmest greetings to the new Poland, to its government and people—were to hold a parade to celebrate their beloved, great, and free Poland of today, who could they expect to protect them?\n\nSuch is the order of today's \"free\" America. That is how writers are received there, how the representatives of the people who fought hand in hand with the American people for peace, democracy, and freedom are received.\n\n(Translator's note: The original article was published in the \"Literary Gazette\" on September 20 of last year.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Moscow dispatch: Soviet Finance Minister Zverev presented the largest budget draft in the history of the Soviet Union's peacetime, for the year 1948, at the joint session of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet on January 31st. The total expenditure is estimated at 387.9 billion rubles, and the total revenue reaches 428 billion rubles. Zverev reported that the implementation of last year's budget resulted in a surplus of 24 billion rubles after offsetting revenue and expenditure. In this year's new budget, the revenue exceeds the expenditure by a huge amount of 40.1 billion rubles. These figures fully demonstrate the strong power of the Soviet social system and its financial system. In this year's new budget draft, the funds allocated to the national economy and social and cultural undertakings account for 68 percent of the total expenditure, compared to only 66 percent last year. Defense expenditure accounts for only 17 percent, totaling 66 billion rubles, which is 2.5 billion rubles more than last year, when it accounted for 18 percent. Zverev continued to prove the cultural development of the Soviet people with moving figures, saying: \"This year, the expenditure on national education will increase to 59.1 billion rubles, and the total number of students will increase to 35 million; among them, the number of students in higher education institutions will increase to 722,000, which has exceeded the figure originally planned for 1950 in the Five-Year Plan. This year, the expenditure on public health will also increase to 20.5 billion rubles.\" Zverev also pointed out: \"In order to help and accelerate the development of the national economy, we will vigorously develop research and investigation work this year, and its expenditure will increase by 7 percent compared with last year.\" These figures eloquently illustrate the Soviet government and the Bolshevik Party's keen concern for improving the lives of the Soviet working people. Stalin himself attended Zverev's report, and the delegates unanimously greeted him with warm cheers as he strode into the venue.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏财长提出本年度预算草案  收入盈余四百亿卢布  充分证明社会主义雄厚力量\n\n1948-02-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏财长提出本年度预算草案\n    收入盈余四百亿卢布\n    充分证明社会主义雄厚力量\n    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联财政部长兹维列夫，上月三十一日在最高苏维埃两院联席会议上，提出苏联和平年代历史上最大的一九四八年度预算草案，计岁出总额为三千八百七十九亿卢布，岁入总额达四千二百八十亿卢布。兹维列夫报告指出：去年预算执行经过，收支相抵盈余达二百四十亿卢布。而在今年新预算中，收入超过支出竟达四百零一亿卢布之巨，这些数字充分证明苏维埃社会制度及其财政制度的雄厚力量。今年新预算草案中规定拨归国民经济与社会、文化事业的经费，占岁出总额百分之六十八，去年仅为百分之六十六。而国防经费仅占百分之十七，总数达六百六十亿卢布，去年则占百分之十八，比今年尚多二十五亿卢布。兹维列夫继续以动人的数字证明苏联人民的文化发展称：“今年国民教育经费将增至五百九十一亿卢布，在学学生总数将增至三千五百万人；其中高等学校学生将增至七十二万二千人，已超过五年计划原定在一九五○年达到的数字。今年公共卫生事业经费，亦将增至二百零五亿卢布。”兹氏并指出：“为帮助并加速国民经济的发展，今年将大力发展调查研究工作，其经费将较去年增加百分之七。”这些数字雄辩地说明了苏维埃政府与布尔什维克党对提高苏联劳动人民生活的热切关怀。兹维列夫报告时，斯大林亦亲自出席，当他健步走入会场时，与会代表一致报以热烈欢呼。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd: In the \"Three Check-ups\" study movement in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, soldiers democratically discussed and recommended a large number of outstanding individuals, who were then approved by the administration and promoted to new cadres. The Fifth Detachment of the Fifth Regiment promoted 19 cadres, including one platoon leader, three deputy platoon leaders, one administrative chief, one clerk, five squad leaders, and eight deputy squad leaders. The criteria for cadre promotion in the Seventh Company were: (1) good class background and firm political stance; (2) capable and determined in combat command, and courageous in battle; (3) good mass discipline and battlefield discipline; (4) caring for soldiers, unbiased in education and management; (5) practical in work and able to endure hardship; (6) able to unite people, not arrogant, and not putting on airs. Kang Leiren, a communication soldier of the Ninth Company of the Sixth Detachment, was recommended and promoted to deputy platoon leader of the First Platoon. At first, he was a little timid, feeling that he could not speak well and could not lead. Deputy Company Commander Zhang Yinsheng explained, \"Difficulties can be solved. I will help you lead the drill for a few days, and you can lead after you learn it. If you can't guide a platoon all at once, start by guiding a squad and discuss with the platoon leader more.\" Company Commander Xu Wenke encouraged him, \"We are from poor backgrounds and don't emphasize being good at talking. As long as you can work practically, that's right. Improve yourself. If you don't take responsibility now, you still won't be able to do it in a few years.\" Kang Leiren gained confidence and bravely took on the responsibility, participating in discussion meetings in the squad and understanding the situation of his platoon. In the \"Three Check-ups\" movement, the unit also actively reorganized the Party branches. A large number of poor and middle peasant soldiers gloriously joined the Communist Party, and the Party work in the company took on a new look. The Fifth Company of the Fifth Detachment developed 15 Party members this time, and other companies are also continuously accepting soldiers' requests to join the Party. Soldiers Hao Fuhai and Yu Fuxing, who were from poor backgrounds, felt very honored after joining the Party and resolutely swore, \"We will never go home until Chiang Kai-shek is completely overthrown and the feudal landlords are eliminated.\" After the company branch increased its new blood, its work became very active. Some established reading groups to strengthen current affairs education, and some companies established new working systems, such as squad leaders and platoon leaders discussing and studying with Party members or Party group leaders in their squads or platoons before planning work or handling problems, thereby closely integrating their work. In the process of mobilizing the masses in the company to discuss and review the conditions for new Party members to join the Party, not only was the purity of the Party organization guaranteed, but also the political awareness and class consciousness of the general soldiers were educated and improved.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北解放军某部三查运动中  战士推荐优秀分子作新干部\n\n1948-02-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    西北解放军某部三查运动中\n    战士推荐优秀分子作新干部\n    【新华社西北三日电】解放军某部三查学习运动中，战士以民主讨论的方式推荐大批优秀分子，经行政批准提拔为新干部。五支队五运提拔了十九个干部，计一个排长、三个副排长、一个事务长、一个事务员、五个班长、八个副班长。七连提拔干部标准是：（一）成份好政治坚定；（二）战斗指挥有能力有决心，作战勇敢；（三）群众纪律和战场纪律均好；（四）关心战士，教育管理不偏心；（五）工作踏实，能吃苦；（六）能团结人，不自高自大，不摆架子。该部六支队九连通讯员康乐仁被大家推选提拔为一排副排长，开始他有些胆怯，觉得自己不会说话不会领导，副连长张寅生解释说：“困难可以解决，我先帮你带几天操，学会了你再带，一下指导不了一个排，先指导一个班，多同排长商量”。连长徐文克鼓励他说：“咱们穷人出身不讲究会说，只要能实干就对，好好提高自己，现在不负担责任，再几年还是不会干”。康乐仁有了信心，便勇敢的负起责来，到班上参加讨论会，并了解本排情况。该部并在三查运动中，积极改造党的支部，大批雇贫农中农战士，光荣的参加了共产党，连队党的工作有了新气象，五支队五连这次发展了十五个党员，其他各连队亦不断的接受战士们的入党的要求。贫苦出身的战士郝富海、于福兴入党后，感到非常光荣，并坚决宣誓“不彻底打倒蒋介石，不消灭封建地主，永不回家”。连队支部增加了新的血液后，工作非常活跃，有的成立了读报组，加强时事教育，有的连队建立了新的工作制度，如班长排长在计划工作或处理问题时，先同本班本排的党员或党的小组长商量研究，密切工作。在发动连队群众讨论与审查新党员入党的条件过程中，不仅保证了党的组织纯洁，而且教育与提高了一般战士的政治觉悟与阶级觉悟。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 3rd: The construction, restoration, and development of transportation, postal and telecommunications, industry, and mining in the Liaonan area have been rapid. In the areas recovered after last year's summer offensive, the democratic government and the masses of the people have overcome many difficulties such as a lack of materials, and significant achievements have been made in various construction works. In terms of transportation: 125 kilometers of the Changchun Railway from Pulandian and Lanping sections, from Wulitai in the south to Lujiatun in the north, were repaired and opened to traffic in July last year, handling passenger and freight transportation, and 16 major railway projects were built successively. All five highways with a total length of 900 kilometers have also been repaired and opened to traffic. In terms of postal and telecommunications: 397 kilometers of high-voltage power transmission lines have been restored. To meet the demands of the vast number of emancipated peasants, more than 150 kilometers of new power transmission lines have been built. In the past six months, the number of electricity users has increased to 16,800 households, power users to 276 households, and electric heating users to 86 households. Recently, the entire electrical lighting equipment of Zhuanghe urban area has been completed, and employees are erecting the Cheng(zi) Zhuang(he) circuit in the frozen and snowy weather. Electric lights have been installed in the rural areas near Wafangdian (i.e., Fuxian). The trunk telephone lines have increased by another 775 kilometers. In addition to the city's local telephone services, long-distance telephone calls to places such as Dashiqiao, Xiuyan in the north, and Ziwo in the south are also unobstructed. Postal services were universally restored in November last year, and post offices or agencies were established in all towns and cities. In terms of industry and mining: In textiles, 23,000 spindles, more than 250 looms, and 12 carpet machines have been restored. More than half of the machines have been re-equipped and repaired. The highest daily output can reach 25 pieces of yarn and 500 bolts of cloth. In the past six months, more than 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn and more than 41,000 bolts of cloth have been produced. In the machinery industry, more than half of the machines for manufacturing ball bearings have been restored, and 80,000 various ball bearings have been produced in the past six months. The sand casting and repair departments have been expanded, ensuring the allocation and repair of machine parts for 40 factories, and more than 50,000 parts have been produced in the past six months. Preliminary research has also been conducted on the manufacture of small machines, and machines such as sawing machines have been created. In addition, according to the needs of the military and civilians, the chemical, paper, ceramic, leather, and oil extraction industries have also developed. The restored and rebuilt coal mines have produced 20,500 tons of coal and more than 100 tons of fuel coal in the past six months. Recently, it is planned to open ten new shafts. In addition, agricultural construction in Liaonan has also made achievements. The agricultural and forestry experimental farm of the administrative office of the district is studying the cultivation of paddy and dry fields and variety experiments of fruit trees and vegetables. Liaonan is rich in apples, with about 1.5 million apple trees. Therefore, a fruit tree research conference was recently held to exchange experiences in fruit tree separation, pest control, fruit pruning, and fertilization. It is also planned to manufacture a large number of insecticidal chemicals for application this year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 辽南解放区一片新气象  交通工矿邮电飞速发展\n\n1948-02-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    辽南解放区一片新气象  交通工矿邮电飞速发展\n    【新华社辽东三日电】辽南地区交通、邮电、工矿等建设，恢复和发展很快。去年夏季攻势后收复的地方，民主政府和人民大众，克服了器材缺乏等许多困难，使各项建设工作都获得了显著的成绩。交通方面：中长铁路普兰店、蓝平段南至五里台，北抵芦家屯一百二十五公里，已于去年七月修复通车，办理客货运输，并先后修筑铁路巨大工程十六件。全长九百公里的五条公路也都修补通车。邮电方面：恢复了高压送电线三百九十七公里。为满足广大翻身农民要求，又新建送电线一百五十多公里。半年来电灯用户增达一万六千八百多户、电力用户二百七十六户、电热用户八十六户。最近又完成了庄河城区的全部电灯设备，员工们正在冰天雪地中架设城（子＠）庄（河）电路。瓦房店（即复县）附近的农村都安设了电灯。电话干线又增了七七五公里，除各市市内电话外，北至大石桥、岫岩，南至子窝等地的长途电话都畅通。邮政于去年十一月普遍恢复，各城镇都设有邮局或代办所。工矿方面：纺织上已恢复纺纱机二万三千锭、布机二百五十多台、毯机十二台。一半以上的机器是重新配修的。一天最高能产二十五件纱，五百匹布。半年来共产纱二千多件、布四万一千多匹。机器工业制造滚珠的机器恢复了一半多，半年来出产各种滚珠八万个。翻砂和修理部分都扩大了，保证了四十个工厂机件的配制和修理，半年出了零件五万多。并初步研究了制造小型机器，创造了压锯珠机等。此外，根据军民需要，化学、造纸、陶磁、皮革、榨油等工业都有发展。恢复和重建的煤井，半年已出煤二万零五百吨、燃炭百多吨。最近又计划新开采十个井口。此外辽南农业建设也有成绩，该区行署的农林试验场正研究水、旱田栽培和果树、蔬菜品种试验。辽南盛产苹果，约有苹树一百五十万株，因此日前特召开了一次果树研究会，交流分果树、防害、剪果、施肥等经验。并准备制大批防虫化学药品供今年施用。"

The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yantai stipulated that all citizens aged eighteen to thirty-four must be drafted into the army. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Weixian stipulated the conscription of 10,000 men, and even the Dejuzhidong firm in the city had fifteen people taken away. Wang Hongjiu, the eighth district commissioner of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Linyi, ordered the conscription of 10,000 men, often sending armed forces to surround markets to seize laborers, or launching dawn raids on villages to arrest people. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Zaozhuang, Yixian County, stipulated that each Bao (group of households) must provide twelve draftees, and for each missing draftee, 5 million yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency must be paid. For those without draftees who own land, they must pay 150 million yuan of Chiang Kai-shek currency per mu (unit of area), 20 jin (unit of weight) of sorghum, 5 jin of wheat, and 2,000 yuan for opium expenses. These atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have aroused anger and resistance from the masses. In a village in Tancheng with more than 300 people, in a district in Linyi with more than 100 people, and in more than 20 villages in the Yuhuian guerrilla area, people have organized guerrilla teams or anti-conscription brigades, attacking Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops everywhere and launching anti-conscription struggles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鲁南群众反抗蒋匪  组织反抓丁大队\n\n1948-02-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    鲁南群众反抗蒋匪\n    组织反抓丁大队\n    【新华社华东二十九日电】山东各地蒋匪近疯狂抽丁抓丁，企图补充兵力不足和大批逃亡的缺额。烟台蒋匪规定，凡年在十八到三十四岁的市民，都要抽去当兵。潍县蒋匪规定抽丁一万名，城内德聚东商号一家就被拉走十五人。临沂蒋匪八区专员王洪九下令抓丁一万名，常派出武装包围集市拉夫，或拂晓突击村子抓捕。峄县枣庄蒋匪规定每保出丁十二名，没丁每名出蒋币五百万元，没丁有地的每亩交蒋币一万五千万、高粱二十斤、小麦五斤、洋烟费二千元。蒋匪这种暴行，激起群众愤怒和反抗。郯城某村有三百多人，临沂某区一百多人，和沭河岸游击区二十多村群众，都组织了游击队或反抓丁大队，到处打击蒋伪，展开反抓丁斗争。"

On the 7th of this month, Shanghai cotton merchants will hold a gathering to host the press, denouncing the Chiang bandit's national monopoly capital's ambition to monopolize all cotton. The host of the reception stated: The new measures for cotton yarn and cloth management are to seize the last bit of survival space for cotton merchants, and called on all sectors to provide sympathy and assistance. The private cotton merchants present were filled with indignation, and unanimously protested against the Chiang bandit's new rule of stifling the cotton industry. Furthermore, the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Association also held a meeting at the same time to protest against the Chiang bandit authorities' comprehensive control over cotton yarn and cloth. It is reported that in order to further completely monopolize cotton yarn and cloth in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, the Chiang bandit authorities formally established the \"National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee\" on the 2nd of last month (formerly the \"Textile Industry Regulation Committee\"). From now on, all rights to purchase, transport, and manage all cotton and cloth in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas will be controlled by the committee. All purchases of Chinese cotton, foreign cotton procurement, and cotton allocation and yarn collection will be under the unified control of the committee. Furthermore, all textile factories in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas were ordered to register all spindles, looms, and production quantities before the 10th of last month. Originally, more than 70 percent of the products of private textile factories were forcibly purchased by the Chiang bandit authorities, causing them extreme hardship. Since the establishment of the committee, their business freedom has been completely deprived, and they have been reduced to victims who \"spin and weave on behalf\" of the four major families.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 上海棉商奋起自救  抗拒蒋匪管制\n\n1948-02-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    上海棉商奋起自救\n    抗拒蒋匪管制\n    【新华社陕北三日电】据蒋区杂志消息：沪市棉商为自救计，已公开拒绝蒋匪“花纱布管理委员会”的限期登记存棉，不受该委员会的管制而迳自抛售存棉。本月七日沪市各棉商并集会招待新闻界，痛斥蒋匪国家垄断资本垄断全部棉花之野心。招待会主持者称：花纱布管理新办法是夺取棉商最后一点生存余地，呼吁各界予以同情援助。到会各民营棉商情绪激愤，一致抗议蒋匪扼杀棉业之新统治办法。又沪市棉纱业公会亦于同时集会抗议蒋匪当局对花纱布之全面管制。按：蒋匪当局为了进一步完全垄断蒋管区花纱布，已于上月二日正式成立“全国花纱布管理委员会”（按系由过去之“纺织事业调节委员会”改组而成），今后蒋区全部棉花和纱布的购买、运销和经营的权利全操之于该会，所有华棉收购、外棉采办以及配棉收纱等，均由该会统制。并限令蒋区各纺织厂于上月十日前将全部纱锭、布机和生产数量登记完毕。各民营纺织厂产品原来就有百分之七十以上为蒋匪当局强迫收购，困苦万状，自该委员会成立后，其营业自由更被剥夺一光，沦为替四大家族“代纺代织”的牺牲者。"

    "date": "1948-02-06",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued its twenty-second operational communique, announcing a brief account of the winter offensive and a statistical summary of the results over the past month and a half (from December 15th to January 31st): Since December of last year, our field armies have launched a large-scale winter offensive against the enemy in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees, advancing to fight on the outskirts of the enemy's nest of Shenyang. Our army first used a surprise attack to rapidly surround the enemy's important strongholds of Faku, Zhangwu, Kaiyuan, Xinlitun, and Anshan on the outskirts of Shenyang. The battle first began between Faku and Tieling. The enemy's New Sixth Army's 14th Division and 169th Division, stationed east of Tieling, quickly retreated upon contact. The New 22nd Division stationed in Tieling attempted to reinforce the enemy's Provisional 62nd Division, which was besieged in Faku, but retreated timidly after advancing only 20 li, regrouping with its other two divisions. In the pursuit, we annihilated and captured approximately one enemy regiment. Simultaneously, we eliminated one regiment of the enemy's Provisional 59th Division in Dagujiazi, south of Faku. The enemy army was panicked and quickly transferred the enemy's 50th Division and Provisional 53rd Division from Changchun, the enemy's 71st Army's 87th Division and 91st Division from Siping, the enemy's 43rd Division and 54th Division from Jinzhou, and the enemy's 195th Division from southern Liaoning to the vicinity of Shenyang around the 20th, attempting to consolidate the security of its precarious nest in Shenyang and engage in a decisive battle with us. Our army then used a portion of its main force to capture Zhangwu in one fell swoop on the 28th, completely annihilating the enemy's 79th Division. At the same time, another unit briefly attacked the outskirts of Shenyang and Changchun and annihilated one regiment of the enemy's 207th Division in Wanjintai, northwest of Shenyang, and over 2,000 fleeing enemy soldiers of the Provisional 18th Division east of Beipiao, achieving victory in the first battle of the winter offensive. After suffering this major blow, the enemy concentrated all the forces it could, a total of more than 20 divisions, attempting to relieve the siege of Faku and engage us in a desperate struggle between Shenyang, Xinmin, and Faku. The main forces of its New Third Army and New Sixth Army moved northwest from north of Shenyang, while the headquarters of its New Fifth Army led the 195th Division and 43rd Division northeast from Xinmin. The main forces of its 71st Army and New First Army advanced side by side between the above two routes, cautiously probing, attempting to converge on our army between Xinmin and Faku, and thus a large-scale battle commenced. The enemy's left wing, starting on January 2nd, used infantry, artillery, and air force coordination to fiercely attack our army's positions in Gongzhutun, northeast of Xinmin. After three days, they made no progress, instead falling into the carefully prepared trap of our army. The massive annihilation battle began at 14:00 on the 5th, proceeding fiercely with the close coordination of our infantry and artillery. After 54 hours of intense fighting, by 20:00 on the 7th, we had completely annihilated the enemy's New Fifth Army headquarters and the 195th and 43rd Divisions in the Gongzhutun area. The enemy's New Third Army and New Sixth Army, attempting to provide reinforcements, were blocked 20 li east of Gongzhutun, while the 71st Army and New First Army were blocked southeast of the Liao River, annihilating and capturing over 4,000 enemy soldiers. Furthermore, we annihilated over 1,000 soldiers of the enemy's Provisional 22nd Division and 184th Division, who had attacked from Goubangzi, south of Beizhen, thus concluding the second battle victoriously. The third battle took place in Xinlitun, the main railway junction at the western gateway to Shenyang. The enemy army suffered repeated defeats, and its morale plummeted. The bandit chiefs Chen and Wei also watched as their miscellaneous troops were annihilated, without sending a single soldier to aid them. After our army cleared the periphery of Xinlitun on the 25th, the enemy's 26th Division dared not linger and desperately broke out and fled at 4:00 a.m. on the 26th, only to be completely annihilated within the city and the snow-covered suburbs after only six hours of fighting. At the same time, the enemy's 184th Division in Goubangzi, fearing the annihilation of the defending enemy in Xinlitun, also fled west on the evening of the 27th. We then moved into this important railway junction, pursuing and annihilating a portion of the fleeing enemy, and victoriously completed the third battle. In between the above battles, our other main forces either took the initiative to strike the enemy or covered the masses in attacking the starving bandits who emerged from the four cities of Ji, Chang, Siping, and Faku to loot grain. Some achievements were also made in sporadic battles. Furthermore, the destructive battles of our Jidong army on the Beining Railway, preventing the enemy from reinforcing the Northeast, played a direct and cooperative role in the Northeast battlefield.\n\nThe preliminary statistics of the results in a month and a half (excluding the achievements of our local armies and the Jicha Rehe Liaoning area): (1) A total of 58,548 enemy soldiers were annihilated, including 50,495 regular enemy soldiers, of which 35,741 were captured alive and 14,754 were killed. 7,979 local enemy soldiers were annihilated, of which 6,542 were captured alive and 1,437 were killed or wounded. The enemy regular army divisions annihilated included four entire divisions, namely the 49th Army's 79th Division, 26th Division, New Fifth Army Headquarters, and the 195th and 43rd Divisions. Enemy general-level officers captured included: Chen Linda, Commander of the New Fifth Army; Liu Guangtian, Commander of the 43rd Division; Cheng Hualong, Deputy Commander of the 43rd Division; Yi Xiyin, Chief of Staff of the 43rd Division; Xie Daizheng, Commander of the 195th Division; Yan Ziyun, Deputy Commander of the 195th Division; Chen Shijie, Chief of Staff of the 195th Division; Li Futai, Deputy Commander of the 49th Army's 79th Division; and Xu Gan, Chief of Staff of the 26th Division, a total of nine.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: A reporter from this branch commented on the Northeast People's Liberation Army's one-and-a-half-month achievements, stating: This winter operation, in which our army braved temperatures of minus thirty degrees Celsius, occurred precisely when bandit chieftain Chen Cheng, having suffered a disastrous defeat in our autumn offensive,妄想 [wangxiang - presumptuously attempted/fancifully hoped] to catch his breath, and precisely when bandit Luo Zhuoying was boasting about his \"solid points,\" \"connecting lines,\" and \"expanding areas\" strategy. However, our army neither entered a \"winter hibernation\" as Chen Cheng had imagined, nor did it allow Luo Zhuoying and his ilk's extravagant boasting to materialize in the slightest. Instead, regardless of the bitter cold, we bravely fought the enemy, launched continuous large-scale operations, and directly pressed on the outskirts of the bandit lair of Shenyang, proactively seizing the repeatedly defeated enemy and dealing them heavy blows. In the glorious achievements of the past month and a half, our army not only won three battles and annihilated one army headquarters, four full divisions, and other units, totaling 58,000 troops (the achievements of our local forces and the Jicha Rehe-Liaoning military region have not yet been calculated), but also recovered ten county towns. Several achievements are particularly worth pointing out: First, as a result of our army's three victories, seizing more than ten important towns around Shenyang, the enemy's supply and transportation lines – the Beining and Changchun Railways – became even more fragmented, and the enemy's precarious nests of Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and other major cities became even more isolated. Our army's strategic links between the eastern and western theaters became even more connected, our forces could be concentrated and maneuvered to a greater extent, and even more favorable conditions were created for completely annihilating the Northeast Chiang bandits. Second, the annihilation of an enemy army headquarters and two full divisions in the battle of Gongzhutun in the three victories, and the defeat of ten enemy divisions in the blocking battle, further exposed the enemy's profound contradiction of being unable to fight, unable to defend, and having nowhere to escape. The enemy's attempt to use all possible concentrated forces to make a last-ditch struggle was finally shattered by us. Therefore, the enemy today feels very insecure, even with each of their remaining ten-odd strongholds defended by one to three divisions. If they concentrate their forces again, they will lose the satellite strongholds of the precarious nest of Shenyang and face the possibility of being besieged by our concentrated and powerful corps; if they disperse their defenses, they fear being eaten piecemeal by us, one by one. This is the profound contradiction that bandit chieftains Chen and Wei cannot escape. The anti-people criminal group cannot escape the people's final punishment, and the American reactionaries cannot give them the magic to revive them; this trend is becoming more obvious and certain. Third, our army annihilated the entire 49th Army, which had been reinforced to the Northeast after the autumn offensive, in the one-and-a-half-month winter offensive. This will make the Chiang bandit troops sent to the Northeast battlefield to die in the future even more timid and fearful, losing their fighting courage. Therefore, although the so-called Fan Hanjie Corps has begun to reinforce the Northeast, our powerful Northeast People's Liberation Army has enough strength and confidence to eat one when they come, and eat a pair when two come. This new reinforcement corps will inevitably follow in the footsteps of the 49th Army, as dictated by the situation. Under such circumstances, it is entirely foreseeable that our army will continue to work hard, proactively seize the enemy, quickly and bravely encircle and annihilate them, and continue to win even greater victories.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北分社记者评冬季攻势：  我军冒严寒连续作战  蒋匪不能战不能守逃也无路\n\n1948-02-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    东北分社记者评冬季攻势：\n    我军冒严寒连续作战\n    蒋匪不能战不能守逃也无路\n    【新华社东北四日电】分社记者评东北解放军一个半月的战绩称：此次我军冒零下三十余度严寒的冬季作战，是正当匪首陈诚在我军秋季攻势下，新遭惨败，妄想获得喘息之时，也是正当罗匪卓英正在胡吹什么“固点”、“连线”、“扩面”战略之时。然而我军既未如陈诚所幻想的进入“冬眠状态”，也未使罗卓英辈的特等牛皮，得到丝毫兑现。却仍是不顾天寒地冻，奋勇杀敌，连续大规模作战，直逼匪巢沈阳的四周，主动的抓住屡战屡败的敌人，予以沉重的打击。一个半月来的光辉战绩，我军不仅三战三捷，歼敌一个军部四个整师及其他部队共五万八千余众（我地方兵团及冀察热辽战绩尚未计算在内），收复县城十座。尤其值得指出的几点成就是：第一、由于我军的三战三捷，夺取了沈阳的四周的十余重要城镇，就使得敌人的补给运输线——北宁、中长等铁路，更为支离破碎，敌军危巢沈阳、长春、吉林等大城市，也更陷于独悬孤立。而我军则东西两大战场的战略联系，更为贯通，兵力更能高度集中、机动作战，更加创造了全部歼灭东北蒋匪的有利条件。第二、由于此次三战三捷中公主屯一役我军一举歼敌一个军部，两个整师，并在阻击战中打垮敌军十个师，这样就更加暴露了敌军既不能战、又不能守、逃也无路的深刻矛盾。敌军使用一切可能集中的兵力，进行垂死挣扎的尝试，也终于被我粉碎，因此敌人今日对仅存的十来个据点，每一据点用一至三个师防守，还是感到很不保险。要再集中兵力罢，则危巢沈阳的卫星据点尽失、更有遭到我集中的强大兵团围攻的可能；要分散守备罢，则又害怕被我以大吃小，一一被歼，这就是陈、卫匪首无法解脱的深刻矛盾。反人民的罪恶集团，无法逃脱人民的最后惩罚，美国反动派也无法给他们以起死回生之术，这一趋势是更加明显而确定了。第三、我军在冬季攻势一个半月中，歼灭了秋季攻势以后增援东北的四十九军全部，这就会使得今后被派来东北战场送死的蒋匪部队更加胆寒心战、丧失其战斗勇气。因此尽管所谓范汉杰兵团已开始增援东北，但我强大的东北解放军却有着足够的力量和信心，能够来一个吃一个，来两个吃一双，这个新的增援兵团，其将步入四十九军的后尘，为形势所必然。处在这样的情况下，今后我军再接再厉，主动抓住敌人、迅速勇敢的加以包围歼灭，继续打更大的胜仗，也是完全可以预期的。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-06",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 4th. Our branch reporter recently commented on the morale of the Kuomintang army in Northeast China, stating: In recent years, under the continuous heavy blows of the People's Liberation Army and the influence of the policy of not killing or insulting prisoners, the Kuomintang army in Northeast China has not only been in a completely passive position militarily, but also has undergone new and significant changes in its internal political sentiment. This is primarily reflected in the changes in the composition of the Kuomintang army. The number of veteran soldiers has decreased sharply, while the number of new recruits, who are untrained and harbor dissatisfaction, has increased significantly. New recruits generally account for more than 80% of the troops, and in some cases even up to 90%. These new recruits are entirely conscripted and lack combat skills training, and their sentiments of homesickness and war-weariness are very strong. Soldiers of the enemy's 71st Army, who laid down their weapons in Xinmin, confessed: \"Most of our troops are new recruits from the Northeast, and they are very much looking forward to the People's Liberation Army's attack so that they can take the opportunity to escape.\" Furthermore, according to enemy documents seized by us, in general, Kuomintang companies have three to five deserters almost every day, and the 59th Provisional Division has up to 700 to 800 deserters each month. The 21st Provisional Division had more than 2,000 officially reported deserters in the two years of civil war, and the actual number was probably even greater. Some units even experienced entire companies or platoons deserting. For example, a company of the 552nd Regiment of the 184th Division deserted en masse while washing clothes by the river. Enemy officers also desert frequently. According to incomplete statistics from the Kuomintang Northeast Headquarters itself, from June to November of last year alone, more than 400 middle and lower-ranking officers deserted from the directly subordinate units of the Headquarters. Recently, in Jilin, Changchun, Siping and other places, under the siege of our army, the enemy's mood of defeat has risen, and a large number of deserters have automatically surrendered to our army. A certain unit in the vicinity of Faku has accepted more than 60 surrendered officers and soldiers in fifteen days. Recently, more than 200 Kuomintang soldiers in Jilin surrendered to our army, and in December of last year, two squads surrendered to us with their weapons. In January of this year, four platoons came over to our side collectively. Although the number of Kuomintang soldiers who deserted during combat cannot be statistically determined, according to prisoners' confessions, every time a gun is fired, many people change into civilian clothes and flee. Those who do not have time to escape quickly lay down their weapons in the thousands. For example, in the Xinlitun campaign last month, more than 8,000 of the 9,000 Kuomintang officers and soldiers were captured with just a brief engagement. The ratio of killed and wounded to captured was one to ten. The demand for retirement is also very common within the Kuomintang army. The Kuomintang bandits' frustration is also reflected among senior officers. Liu Zigao, commander of the enemy's 62nd Provisional Division, which was besieged by the People's Liberation Army in Faku, said despondently in a lecture to his subordinates: \"The fortifications we build are tombs, and Faku is the tomb of our division.\" Many officers fear war and have asked to be transferred to rear transport and logistical departments in order to save their lives. Those whose requests are not approved become passive and derelict in their duties, leading a decadent lifestyle, with rampant prostitution and gambling being even more prevalent than before. Our army has examined the bodies of captured officers and found that more than 50% of them suffer from various venereal diseases. The reporter finally pointed out: The officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang bandits in Northeast China have reached a point where it is no longer a matter of consideration but a final choice of fate: either lay down their weapons as soon as possible, or sell their lives for the Kuomintang bandits to the end and bring destruction upon themselves. The People's Liberation Army will spare no opportunity to win over and advise all officers and soldiers who are forced to fight for the Kuomintang bandits, especially middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers. As long as they can lay down their weapons and stand on the side of the people, our army will welcome and treat them favorably without exception.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北蒋匪士气更加低落  全连全排逃亡哗变  打仗一听枪响成千成万投降\n\n1948-02-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    东北蒋匪士气更加低落\n    全连全排逃亡哗变\n    打仗一听枪响成千成万投降\n    【新华社东北四日电】分社记者顷评述东北蒋军士气称：年来东北蒋军在解放军连续沉重的打击与不杀不辱的俘虏政策影响下，不但军事上早已陷于完全被动，而内部政治情绪也发生了新的显著变化。首先表现在蒋军内部成份的变化。部队中老兵急剧减少，未受训练，心怀不满的新兵大量增加。一般部队的新兵占百分之八十以上，有的甚至达百分之九十。这些完全是抓来的新兵，毫无战斗技术的训练，思乡厌战的情绪十分浓厚，在新民放下武器的敌七十一军士兵供称：“我们部队多是东北新兵，非常盼望解放军进攻，以便乘机逃跑”。又据我缴获敌方文件证明：蒋军一般连队几乎每天都有三、五个逃亡，暂五十九师每月逃亡达七百至八百名。暂廿一师在两年内战中，其公开呈报的逃亡数字为两千余名，实际数目当比这更大。有的部队甚至是全连全排逃亡。如一八四师五五二团一个连，一次到河边洗衣，即全连哗变。敌军官逃亡的亦多。据蒋匪东北行辕自己的不完全统计，自去年六月至十一月间，仅行辕直属部队之中下级军官就逃了四百多人。最近吉林、长春、四平等地在我军围困下，敌军失败情绪高涨，大批逃亡者自动向我军投诚。某部在法库附近，十五天中收容了投诚官兵六十多名。吉林蒋军最近向我军投诚的有两百多名，去年十二月中有两班携械向我投诚。今年一月份中有四个排集体来归。蒋军在战斗中潜逃的数字虽无法统计，但据俘虏供称：每是枪声一响，就有很多人换上便衣逃走。不及逃跑的，即成千成万的迅速放下武器，如上月新立屯战役蒋匪九千余官兵稍一接触，即有八千余名就俘，毙伤与被俘是一与十之比，蒋军内部要求退伍的也很普遍。蒋匪的沮丧情绪也表现在高级军官之中，被解放军围困的法库敌暂六十二师师长刘梓皋在一次对部下的训话中灰心丧气的说：“工事修好了就是坟墓，法库就是我们这个师的坟墓”。许多军官恐惧战争，纷纷要求调到后方运输勤杂等部门去，以求保身保命。要求不准的则消极怠职，生活颓废，狂嫖滥赌较前更甚。我军曾检查被俘军官的身体，发现患各种性病的达百分之五十以上。记者最后指出：东北蒋匪官兵已到了不是考虑而是最后选择命运的时候了，或者趁早放下武器，或者替蒋贼卖命到底，自取灭亡。解放军不惜任何机会争取与忠告一切被迫为蒋贼作战的官兵，特别是中下级官兵，只要他能够放下武器，站到人民方面来，我军一律表示欢迎和优待。"

    "content": "County and District Cadres Protect Village Cadres, Forming an Anti-People Clique\n    Supplementary Regiment Three Soldiers File Complaint\n    To the Comrades in charge of the People's Daily:\n    We are from Donglizhuang, Second District, Qiu County, Hebei-Henan-Shandong Border Region. We are currently studying in the Second Supplementary Regiment of the Military Region. We are soldiers. Now that we are studying the Land Law Outline, we understand that we must allow poor and hired peasants to thoroughly stand up, no longer oppressed by landlords, rich peasants, cadres, and ungrateful bad cadres. Therefore, we ask the newspaper to publish our opinions, correct the dark phenomena in our village, and enable poor and hired peasants to achieve a thorough transformation in land and politics.\n    Xie Jinqing's family is a rich peasant, with more than 70 mu of land, 24 rooms, one ox, and a family of five. The land is all good land. During famine years, they had more than 100 mu of land, later selling off 30 mu. They live a landlord's life. Xie Jinqing's wife is the director of the Women's Association, a loose woman who has had a relationship with the village head, Xie Xuelin, for 18 years. Her eldest son is the director of the Farmers' Association, already given to his uncle as a son, also a rich peasant, and is a dictatorial ruler in the village, feared by poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants alike. Xie Hongqi, a desperately poor peasant, is the leader of the Farmers' Association group, and his wife is the deputy director of the Women's Association. Because they worked actively and opposed the director of the Women's Association protecting the family members of the traitor Zhang Sumei, they offended the director of the Farmers' Association, the director of the Women's Association, and the village head. As a result, Xie Hongqi is now in the county government prison, and the deputy director was removed from her position and told to confess to the masses.\n    Xie Xuelv, a poor peasant, is the director of the trade union. Because of unfair distribution of fruit, he raised objections to the director of the Farmers' Association and the village head, and as a result, he was tied up and beaten by the militia, removed from his position, and expelled from the Farmers' Association. Xie Liang, a desperately poor peasant, was beaten more than ten times by village cadres because he spoke carelessly and liked to say strange things about the village cadres. Xie Jiujin, an activist, was beaten twice by village cadres for opposing corruption and forced to join the army, and has been gone for three years.\n    Xie Xuelin used to be a puppet Bao trưởng (head of a Bao, an administrative division), and became the village head as soon as the Eighth Route Army arrived, and has not been replaced for more than ten years. The masses have requested his replacement three times, but he has not been replaced. When returning to the team this year, he protected his brother-in-law and did not allow him to return to the team. He also protects Xie Xuexin at home (a deserter), and is a tyrannical demon in the village.\n    Why are they able to flaunt their power? The main reason is that county and district cadres support them. Xie Qingji, a district cadre from a large landlord family, supports them and gives them ideas. When Zhang, the Minister of the County Armed Forces Committee (Wenzhu), and Guo, the Director of the District Armed Forces Committee (Xinmin), came to the village, the village cadres treated them like gods, providing them with wine and meat. At the same time, they divided the Farmers' Association's 30 mu of good land to the two of them, ordering the villagers and militia to cultivate it for them. Zhang Wenzhu's land has been cultivated for him for two years, and Guo Xinmin's land has been planted for three years and now sold, selling for 8,000 yuan per mu, putting the money in their own pockets.\n    The masses once wanted to struggle against the director of the Women's Association, and the loose woman was so frightened that she ran to Zhang Wenzhu's house, wrote a letter, and returned to the village as director, still oppressing the masses. Zhang Wenzhu wrote a letter to the masses threatening them, saying: Do not allow her to be replaced, the director treats people well. In this way, the masses were suppressed. The village head's older brother is the head of the self-defense force, raping Xie Xueli's wife, also openly. Families who have been struggled against often invite these village cadres to eat and drink, and the masses dare not speak.\n    Do the two county and district cadres also divide the fruits in their homes, and do they go to various villages to divide the Farmers' Association's land? Is it right for District Cadre Guo Xinmin to sell 15 mu of land from our village? Is it right for District Cadre Jia Shumei to privately sell 27,000 public bricks and embezzle local public grain accounts before running to the district to become a cadre?

He had a lawsuit with a landlord, and at that time, whoever had money had the right, \"one can't twist one's arm against one's thigh.\" His few acres of bad land were all used up. He couldn't maintain a living at home, so in 1934 he fled to work hard on the railroad in Shan County, where he had been for thirteen years. After the People's Liberation Army liberated Shan County, he returned home a few days ago. He said to the villagers: \"The people in the KMT-controlled areas are really suffering. They are constantly conscripting soldiers. For example, buying a soldier costs 500,000 yuan, and giving 400,000 to his company commander will send him home. Those KMT soldiers say: 'We only go to sell ourselves for money and don't care about work, we can only be soldiers and don't care about fighting.' Over there, eating one pound of steamed bread costs 16,000 yuan, and many starving refugees die. Since the Eighth Route Army liberated Shan County, the county magistrate held a meeting in the city, and he said: 'Now those of us who have suffered from poverty can stand up!' He used the foreign flour, rice, and clothes left behind by the KMT army to help the refugees. The county magistrate also said: There are many people from other provinces and counties in the city. Now the liberated areas are all dividing land! They can divide land and houses. If they want to go home, the government will give them travel expenses. I received half a month's travel expenses and came home. I just said that I couldn't go home in this lifetime. I didn't expect the Communist Party to send me back.

    "content": "Short Commentary:\n\n    Thoroughly Clean Up Agency Production\n    The Central Bureau has announced a decision on cleaning up agency production and has established a region-wide cleanup committee to be responsible for leading cleanup work in various locations. This is an important measure in our region's efforts to rectify rear-area agencies and fully support the front lines.\n    According to preliminary statistics, the total amount of funds for agency production in departments supplied by the border region's grain and funds reaches approximately 600,000,000 yuan (excluding those belonging to individuals and borrowers). Although these agency productions have provided some subsidies to the expenses of their respective units, the vast majority are engaged in commercial speculation. As a result, the phenomenon of infringing on the interests of the masses, and even corruption and embezzlement, is quite common. Some units rely on agency production (with funds exceeding 50,000,000 yuan), spending money arbitrarily and wastefully. Other units, however, have low incomes from agency production, and their difficulties cannot be solved. Now, all funds from agency production will be collected as border region fiscal revenue, and additional necessary expenses will be uniformly issued to replace the original difference subsidized by agency production. This will not only save the border region's annual fiscal revenue and expenditure but also balance the treatment of various units and eliminate corruption and waste. Agency production occupies a large number of miscellaneous personnel. For example, the entire staff of the Border Government is only 150, while production personnel number 200. Cixian County Government has fewer than 50 people, but production personnel number more than 80. After the end of agency production, these personnel can be transferred to work in other departments. The financial and human resources to support the front lines will be greatly enhanced!\n    In Handan and Changzhi, agency production accounts for more than half of all industry and commerce. In Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other places, it accounts for 70%. In this way, the development of private capital is bound to be suppressed. The Central Bureau has decided to abolish all agency production and has made it clear that \"if they are factories, workshops, or shops that are beneficial to the local area, they can be transferred to local cooperatives or private management at a price.\" This will enable some industrialists and businessmen to dare to operate freely and stimulate the development of private capital.\n    Cleanup work is not only the responsibility of finance, economics and production departments, but all comrades should fully recognize its great significance and unite to care for revolutionary property, preventing anyone from taking advantage of loopholes to embezzle, waste, or steal property!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 彻底清理机关生产\n\n1948-02-06\n第1版()\n专栏：短论\n\n    彻底清理机关生产\n    中央局公布了关于清理机关生产的决定，并成立全区清理委员会，负责领导各地清理工作。这是我区整顿后方机关全力支援前线中一项重要的措施。\n    据初步统计：由边区粮款供给的部门的机关生产，资金总数达六十万万元左右（属于个人及借贷者在外）。这些机关生产，虽然对本单位的经费有所补助，但绝大部分均系从事商业投机。因而侵犯群众利益，以至贪污腐化的现象相当普遍。某些单位因有机关生产的依靠（有资金达五万万以上者），随便开支，铺张浪费。而另一些单位，机关生产收入不大，困难则无法解决。现在所有机关生产的资金，全部收作边区财政收入，再统一增发各项必须的经费，代替原来由机关生产补助的差额。这样做，不仅全年边区财政收支，可以节约，而且使各单位的待遇平衡，杜绝贪污浪费。机关生产占了很大一批干杂人员。如边府全部人员才一百五十，而生产人员却有二百，磁县县政府不到五十人，而生产人员却有八十多，机关生产结束之后，这些人员都可以转入其他部门工作了。支援前线的财力、人力，得以大大增强！\n    邯郸、长治两市，全部工、商业中，机关生产在一半以上，阳城、晋城等地，更占了百分之七十。这样，私人资本的发展势必遭受了压抑。中央局决定取消一切机关生产，而且明确指出：“如系工厂作坊及对地方有益的商店，可作价转让当地合作社或私人经营”。这就使一部工商业家敢于放手经营，刺激私人资本的发展。\n    清理工作不仅是财经、生产部门的责任，全体同志都应充分认识其重大意义，一致起来关心革命财产，防止任何人钻空贪污浪费、窃取财物的企图！"

    "content": "Rectify Organization, Develop People's Economy\n    Central Bureau Decides to Clean Up Organ Production\n    Regional Cleanup Committee Formally Established\n    [This Newspaper's News] The CCP Jinji-Luyu Central Bureau issued the \"Decision on Cleaning Up Organ Production\" on January 20th, the original text of which is as follows:\n    In our region, all levels of Party, government, military, civilian organs, troops, groups, and schools have undertaken organ production to overcome financial difficulties and subsidize organ expenses. Over the past few years, they have completed certain tasks. However, in subsequent development, due to violating the principle of personally producing wealth, they have gradually leaned towards commerce, thus leading to drawbacks such as infringing upon the interests of the masses, engaging in speculation, disrupting finance, and undermining policies. Some even shielded targets of struggle and concealed the fruits of struggle, while a few individuals became corrupt and degenerate as a result. Now, in order to rectify the organization and develop the people's economy, the following decisions are made:\n    1.  Except for personally undertaken, spare-time production, such as land reclamation, spinning, knitting sweaters, sewing, raising pigs, and flour mills and tofu workshops opened to improve the lives of organ personnel (but not allowed to use public grain or funds, nor allowed to hire labor to operate, and if there is a surplus of products, they are only allowed to sell to cooperatives, not directly to the market) and organ employee production-consumption cooperatives registered in accordance with cooperative regulations, or supply factories set up due to work needs, which are specially permitted to continue operating after approval by the border government, all other organ production must be terminated and cleaned up. All purchasing units established externally by various units must be terminated or transferred to the Trade General Company, and the purchasing tasks will be taken over by the Trade General Company.\n    2.  For organ production departments supplied by border region grain funds, their public shares, assets, and dividends shall be submitted to the Border Region Finance Department as border region fiscal revenue. Those supplied by local grain funds shall be turned over to local fiscal revenue and handed over to governments above the county level. Those operated with village grain funds shall be rectified in the rectification of village finances. Those belonging to individuals or loans shall be returned to individuals or creditors after proof. If they are the fruits of mass struggle, or land occupied and rented from farmers, they shall be unconditionally returned to the local farmers' association and distributed to farmers. Land, houses, tools, etc., bought and sold from farmers shall be returned to the farmers separately. For public funds invested in private shops, factories, or cooperatives, the funds and dividends must be withdrawn and handled in accordance with the above-mentioned methods.\n    3.  Organ production such as factories, workshops, and shops that are beneficial to the local area can be transferred to local cooperatives or private operation at a price. Paper cigarette factories, wineries, and larger shops that are beneficial to the local area shall be taken over by industrial and commercial departments at a price. Transportation tools, livestock, large quantities of cotton, cloth, salt, medicine, telecommunications, printing equipment, etc., can be purchased by the transportation and trade departments. Raw gold, silver cash, and securities shall be submitted to the corresponding level of finance departments and transferred level by level to the Border Region Finance Department. Assets that are inconvenient to transfer, unsalable goods, and remnants shall be sold at a marked price. Those that cannot be sold shall be transferred to the trade departments for processing at a low price.\n    4.  All organ production that has been decided to be terminated shall be limited to stopping business operations and completing procedures by the end of February 1937 and completing the termination by the end of May. Its branches should be concentrated in the general store for processing. Members will be sent by the liquidation committee to assist the competent personnel of the organ production to register all the assets. Without the permission of the liquidation committee, no organ may use it, let alone drill holes, eat and drink heavily, embezzle, waste, or steal property, and those who violate it will be treated as corruption. All organ production cadres will be introduced to the organization departments of the same level Party committees or military region political departments by the liquidation committee at any time to be assigned other jobs, but their main responsible persons shall not be transferred during the liquidation period to assist in the work. Hired and miscellaneous personnel shall be handled by the liquidation committee in conjunction with the original competent authority. In order to implement the liquidation of organ production and the finances of various organs, the organ surplus of 36 years must be turned over to the public. If the organ production assets have been used to make up for losses and have been reviewed and approved by the liquidation committee, they will be allowed to be written off, and those that are not allowed must be recovered. In order to solve certain losses of various levels of organs and units and certain difficulties that may occur due to the cancellation of organ production, 20% shall be retained from the received assets, which shall be uniformly controlled and resolved by the Border Region Finance Department, the General Military Region Supply Department, and the administrative office and military region. During the liquidation period, the liquidation committee, in conjunction with the industrial, commercial, trade, financial departments, cooperatives, exchanges, etc., shall be responsible for adjusting prices to prevent soaring and plummeting. In order to promote thrift, encourage savings, and prevent the malpractices of individual production, the assets withdrawn by individuals can be saved in the Jinnan Bank or invested in shops established by the industrial and commercial trade departments.\n    5.  In order to thoroughly clean up organ production, it is decided that the heads of all levels and units are responsible for the cleaning up work. The Central Bureau organizes a regional cleaning committee to be responsible for leading, inspecting, receiving and other matters. The organ production of the troops system is led and organized by the Political Department of the Great Military Region, and is responsible to the regional cleaning committee. The cleaning committees of all levels of local Party, government, civilian and school organizations are selected and appointed by the Party committees at the same level, are led by the Party committees at the same level, and are responsible to the cleaning committees at the higher level. The heads of all levels and units are responsible not only to the cleaning committee at the same level, but also to their directly subordinate leading organs. The functions and powers of the cleaning committees at all levels are mainly to clean up, inspect, receive, keep, auction, and transfer all assets and supervise the submission of the same level of financial departments, and those who cannot submit immediately must report at any time, and should frequently report the cleaning situation and summarize experience.\n    [This Newspaper's News] In order to thoroughly clean up the production of various organs and troops in the region, the Central Bureau decided on January 30th to form a regional cleaning committee composed of seven comrades, including Rong Wusheng, Zhou Wenlong, Wang Shiying, Zhang Nansheng, Ping Jiesan, Zhou Yucheng, and Lin Haiyun. Under the leadership of the Central Bureau, it is responsible for the leadership, inspection, receiving and other matters of the regional cleaning work, and decided that Comrades Rong Wusheng and Zhou Wenlong should be appointed as the chairman and vice-chairman of the committee respectively. The cleaning committees of each district and each directly affiliated organ, in addition to being led by the Party committees at the same level, must be responsible to the committee.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 整顿组织发展人民经济  中央局决定清理机关生产  全区清理委员会正式成立\n\n1948-02-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    整顿组织发展人民经济\n    中央局决定清理机关生产\n    全区清理委员会正式成立\n    【本报消息】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局于一月二十日发出“关于清理机关生产的决定”，原文如下：\n    我区各级党政军民机关、部队、团体、学校，为克服财政困难，补助机关经费，进行的机关生产，几年来，完成了一定任务。但在以后发展中，由于违反了亲自动手生产财富原则，逐渐偏向商业，因而发生侵犯群众利益，投机取巧，捣乱金融，破坏政策等弊端，甚有包庇斗争对象，隐蔽斗争果实，而少数人员亦因此贪污腐化。兹为整顿组织，发展人民经济，特作如下决定：\n    一、除亲自动手，业余生产，如开荒、纺织、打毛衣、缝纫、养猪、以及为改善机关人员生活所开设之粉房、豆腐坊（但不准动用公粮、公款，不准雇工经营，其产物如有剩余只准卖给合作社，不准直接向市场推销）和按照合作社条例登记之机关职工生产消费合作社，或因工作需要，所设之供给工厂，经边府批准，特许其继续经营外，其他一切机关生产，一律结束清理。各单位对外设立之采购单位，一律结束或移交贸易总公司，采购任务，统交贸易总公司接办。\n    二、凡由边区粮款供给的部门的机关生产，其公股资财及红利悉解边府财政厅，作边区财政收入。由地方粮款供给者，归地方财政收入，交县级以上政府。村粮款经营者，在整顿村财政中整顿之。属于个人或借贷部分，经证明后，归还个人或债权人，如系群众斗争果实，或占种租种农民之土地，应无条件交还当地农会，分给农民。典买农民之土地房屋工具等，分别退还农民。公款投入私人商店工厂或合作社者，其资金及红利均须抽回，依上列办法处理。\n    三、机关生产如系工厂作坊及对地方有益的商店，可作价转让当地合作社或私人经营。纸烟工厂酒坊对地方有益之较大商店，则作价交工商部门接办。交通运输工具、牲畜、大宗棉、布、盐、医药、电讯、印刷器材等，可交交通贸易部门购买。生金银现款及有价证券，悉交同级财政部门，递级转解边府财政厅，其中不便转让之资财，冷货残物，采取标价出售办法，无法出售者，低价转让贸易部门处理。\n    四、凡决定结束的一切机关生产，统限于三十七年二月底停止经营办理手续，五月底结束完毕，其所设分支店，应集中总店办理，由清理委员会派员协同机关生产之主管人员登记全部资财，非经清委会允许，任何机关不得动用，更不得钻空、大吃大喝、贪污浪费或窃取财物，违者以贪污论。所有机关生产干部，由清委会根据情况，随时介绍同级党委或军区政治部组织部门，另行分配工作，但其主要负责人员，在清理期间，不得他调，以协助工作进行。雇用及杂务人员，由清委会会同原主管机关处理之。为贯彻清理机关生产及各机关之财政，其三十六年度之机关节余，须一律交公，其因弥补亏空，已动用机关生产资财，经清委会审查批准者，准予报销，不准者必须追回。为解决各级机关单位某些亏空及因取消机关生产可能发生的某些困难，于接收资财中，截留二成，由边府财政厅、大军区供给部及行署军区统一掌握解决之。在清理期间，清委会协同工商贸易金融部门及合作社交易所等，负责调整物价，以防暴涨暴跌。为提倡节约，奖励储蓄，防止个人生产之流弊，个人抽回之资财，可由冀南银行储蓄，或投入工商贸易部门所设之商店。\n    五、为彻底清理机关生产，决定清理工作，由各级及各机关单位首长负责。中央局组织全区清理委员会负责领导检查接收等事宜。部队系统之机关生产，由大军区政治部领导组织清理，并对全区清委会负责。各级地方党政民学组织各级清委会，其人员由同级党委选任，受同级党委领导，并对上级清委会负责。各级及各机关单位首长，除对同级清委会负责外，并对其直属上级领导机关负责。各级清委会之职权，主要为清理检查接收保管拍卖及转让一切资财并监督同级财政部门上解，不能即时上解者，须随时表报，并应经常报告清理情况及总结经验。\n    【本报消息】为彻底清理全区各机关部队生产，中央局于一月三十日决定以戎伍胜、周文龙、王世英、张南生、平杰三、周玉成、林海云等七同志组成全区清理委员会。在中央局领导下，负责全区清理工作的领导、检查、接收等事宜，并决定戎伍胜、周文龙两同志分任该委员会正副主任委员，各区各直属机关之清委会，除受同级党委领导外，均须对该委员会负责。"

    "content": "Yang Xihe Abuses His Power\n    Yang Songling Appeals for Justice for Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers in Gaojia Village\n\nTo the Editorial Comrades:\n\nAfter reading the news in the People's Daily on January 16th about the Wu'an government shielding cadres, I was reminded of the injustice suffered by Gao Wenlu, a poor peasant from Gaojia Village in the tenth district of my county (Ci County). He was harmed by someone connected to the government and other departments who abused their power. This oppressor is named Yang Xihe, an old cadre who had been to Yan'an, served as the district head of the ninth district of Ci County, and as the political commissar of the eleventh district. His current position is unclear. I can cite several instances to prove his persecution of poor peasants and hired laborers:\n\n    1. During the Japanese occupation, he and the then district head, Wu Zenglu, arrested five or six people from his village, all of whom were poor peasants, on suspicion of being traitors. Whether they were or not, I don't know, but Gao Haiqing was beaten to death. I forget the names of the others.\n    2. Yang Xihe's fourth elder brother, named Jingzhi, whose full name I forget, used Gao Quancheng's rope net (a type of agricultural tool), for some reason, and one dark night, threw Meng Baizi, a resident of their village, into a well southeast of Changjia Village. The year, month, and day of this event can be thoroughly clarified by asking Gao Quancheng.\n    3. Yang Xihe's son, Yang Tingkui, along with his cousin from Jiang Village (whose name I don't know), tied up Gao Wenlu and shot him three or four times with a gun. He was not killed, but thrown into a well east of Zuocheng Village. The next day, Gao Wenlu was found alive and rescued by others. The date of this event can be obtained by asking Gao Wenlu.\n    4. Yang Xihe's second sister-in-law is a widow and not very reputable (a loose woman). She married Gao Quancheng from his village, which he disapproved of, feeling it was a disgrace to him. He often sought to harm Gao Quancheng. During the land reform, Yang Xihe used the pretext of struggling against landlords to demand that Gao Quancheng be struggled against and have all his property confiscated. To this day, Gao Quancheng is afraid to live at home and has fled to Ci County City to open a steamed bun shop on Fuju Temple Street.\n    5. Last spring, four or five villages struggled against Rong family, a feudal landlord in Xipeng Township. During this struggle, he personally embezzled the majority of the fruits of the struggle that Gaojia Village received, including good land and livestock.\n    6. Because Gao Wenlu was a poor peasant with no relatives or friends and no one to back him up, he was controlled by Yang Xihe and made the chairman of the village peasant association. Because the Yang family was the strongest in Gaojia Village, Duan Jilei, a cadre from the tenth district armed work committee stationed in the village at that base point, talked to the peasant association chairman several times after learning about the situation, encouraging him to have the courage to struggle against the Yang family and asking the peasant associations of neighboring military camp villages to provide assistance. As a result, Yang Xihe was persuaded, and he answered the questions raised by the masses. The masses ended up dragging him several yards. This caused a great disaster. District Head Wang Jingsheng and Political Commissar Han Jiuru were both angered by Yang Xihe and insisted that it was a counter-revolutionary sabotage. They brought Gao Wenlu to the Xiangshan District Office, where he was hung up and beaten. To this day, Gao Wenlu is still detained in the detention room of the Ci County Judicial Section, and I don't know if he is alive or dead.\n\nEditorial Comrades: You may not know that Gao Wenlu's family has only his elderly mother, who is over sixty years old, and no one to care for her. Also, Yang Xihe seized all the fruits of the struggle that Gao Wenlu had been given, claiming that Gao Wenlu had embezzled funds as chairman. Gao Wenlu's mother knelt before Yang Xihe, begging him, but Yang Xihe used sweet words to deceive this woman. The reason why no one dares to speak out against Yang Xihe's evil deeds is because of these reasons: Firstly, he had been to Yan'an and lived in school, and no one knows how much power and influence he has; secondly, the current Deputy County Head Wu Heqian, District Head Wang Jingsheng, Political Commissar Han Jiuru, and Sun Haohui all have some private connections with him, and it can be said that Yang Xihe is well-connected with these people; thirdly, he used to be a district head and political commissar, and his nephew and eldest son are both working outside, and no one knows how much influence they have. In short, people are afraid of speaking out about this matter and bringing misfortune upon themselves. I cannot reveal all the details. These are just some of the things I know. To fully understand every aspect of Yang Xihe's affairs, ask Gao Quancheng, ask Gao Wenlu in the judicial section, and ask the poor peasants of Gaojia Village, and you will be able to uncover the truth little by little.\n\nMy starting point for writing this is to appeal for justice for the suffering poor peasants and to inform the leadership that some people are taking advantage of the Communist Party and acting recklessly. Yang Xihe's class background is very impure. In my personal opinion, he is from a landlord family (in his village).\n\nIn addition, I am clarifying my class background and origin. I come from a poor peasant family, and besides enduring hardship, I participate in work. I am from Junying Village, Ci County, and Yang Sanqian is my father. I work in the third district of Handan and am now in the second team of the southern-bound cadres of the Jinnan Third Special Commissioner's Office, located in Qizhicheng. My name is Yang Songling. If you are unclear about where I wrote from, you can write to me, and I will definitely tell you what I know. If I am transferred, you can find the people I have written about as objects of investigation and understanding.

Otherwise, you can come here to conduct an actual investigation and understanding.\n\n    Yang Songling, written January 23rd\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杨希和仗势欺人  杨松龄替高家庄贫雇诉冤屈\n杨松龄\n1948-02-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    杨希和仗势欺人\n    杨松龄替高家庄贫雇诉冤屈编辑同志们：\n    我看了人民日报一月十六日登了武安政府包庇干部的消息以后，我想起了我县（磁县）第十区高家庄贫农高文禄的冤枉事，他被与政府及其他部门有联系的人仗着势力来残害。这个压迫人的人叫杨希和，是个老干部，到过延安，当过磁县九区区长，当过第十一区政委，现在职务不明。他残害贫雇可举几个事来证明：\n    一、日本在时，他与当时的区长吴增禄一同抓了他村五、六个人，都是贫农，据说是汉奸，到底是不是，我不清楚，生把高海青活活地打死，其别人我忘了。\n    二、杨希和的四哥叫景至，大名字（字）我忘了，拿高全成的绳络子（是一种农具），不知是因为啥事，在一天黑夜，将在他村住户的孟罢子，扔到常家庄村东南一个井里了，那年那月那日，问高全成即可彻底明白。\n    三、杨希和的儿子杨廷魁与蒋村他的表亲，（名字（字）我不知道），两个人将高文禄捆住用枪打了三四枪，未打死，扔到佐城村东井里，第二天高文禄未死，被别人捞出，这个事情年月日问高文禄便知。\n    四、杨希和二嫂是寡妇，同时不很好（破鞋），与他村高全成结了婚，他不满意，觉得丢了他的人，他就时常想搞高全成，杨希和趁着土地改革，以斗争地主为名，就非斗争高全成与没收他的全部财产不行，至今吓的高全成不干（敢）在家住，逃到磁县城府君庙街开馍馍房。\n    五、在去年春天，四、五个村斗争西彭厢封建大地主荣家，这次斗争，高家庄分到的果实，好地与牲口，他个人大部独吞了。\n    六、高文禄因为是个贫农，又没有什么亲戚朋友，更没有什么人当后台，就被杨希和掌握，当了该村农会主任。因为高家庄数了他杨家就没有再比他们强了，当时在这个基点的坐村干部是十区武委会段计雷同志，他了解了一下，就给农会主任谈了几次话，鼓起了斗争杨家的勇气，并叫有军营村农会联合帮助，结果是把杨希和说住了，群众给他提出的问题他都答复了，群众结果是拖了他几丈远，这一下可惹出了大祸，区长王景生、政委韩九如，都给杨希和一气，硬说这是特务捣鬼，把高文禄弄到了香山区公所，吊打了一顿，至今高文禄还被扣在磁县司法科的禁闭室里，现在死活我不清楚。\n    编辑同志：你可不知道，高文禄家里只剩老母，已有六十多岁，没人招管，同时高文禄分了点果实，杨希和借口说高文禄当主任有贪污，都收拾了。高文禄母亲跪到杨希和脸前，养（央）告不起，杨希和用巧言花语，哄起了这个女人。杨希和为啥这样的坏没人干（敢）说，是有这几个事：一个是他到过延安，住过学校，别的人说不清他有多大权利，有多大势力；二个是现在的副县长吴合谦、区长王景生与韩政委、孙好会都给他有些私人拉拢，也可以说杨希和到这几个人跟前吃得开；三个是他过去当区长当政委，他侄儿与他大儿都在外工作，也不知有多大势力。总之，是怕说了这事，自己倒霉。详细情形，我不能说出来，这只是我个人所了解的一些，要想弄清杨希和的每一件事情，问高全成，问现在司法科的高文禄，问高家庄的贫农，才会一点一滴弄的清清楚楚。\n    我写这个东西的出发点，就是为受罪的贫农申冤告状，叫领导上也知道有些人投共产党的机，胡作乱为。杨希和的成份是很不纯的，以我个人的眼光看，他是地主成份（在他村说）。\n    另外，我写明我的成份与出身，我是个贫农出身，除了会受苦，就参加工作。我是磁县军营村人，杨三迁是我的父亲。我在邯郸三区工作，现在是要南下、现在冀南三专署企之城南干部第二队，我叫杨松龄。我写的地方，你们不清楚可来信，我所知道的一定告知。如果我调走了，可找我写的人为调查了解的对像（象）。我所写的，我都能找出证据，同时写的每个问题，我都负责，可不是胡写的，不然的话，你们到这里做实际调查了解。\n        杨松龄  写一月廿三日"

    "content": "Land Reform in Poland\n    By Anna Louise Strong\n    Translated by Li Dihua\n    This article is excerpted from the book \"New Poland As I Saw It\" by American journalist Anna Louise Strong, and it describes events in the winter of 1944.\n    At that time, the Polish people were still engaged in the war of resistance against Germany. Eastern Poland had been liberated by the Soviet army, and Polish peasants, under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party (Polish Communist Party) and the Committee of National Liberation, distributed land that accounted for one-fifth of Polish territory. On this basis, they defeated the German fascist bandits and established New Poland. As Comrade Li Dihua stated in the preface to his translation, \"We must take into account the new developments in the Polish land reform movement in the past two years.\" As land reform deepened and the broad masses awakened, the new democratic regime in Poland became increasingly consolidated, causing the remaining reactionary elements fostered by American and British imperialists to also roll out of Poland. (The book \"New Poland As I Saw It,\" translated by Comrade Li Dihua, has been published by Xinhua Bookstore in North China. The entire book is over 100,000 words. This excerpt is only a small part of it.)\n        —Editor\n\n    Everyone knows that changing feudal land relations is necessary. In Poland, this change also has international reasons. In the past twenty-five years, feudal land rights have complicated border disputes between Poland and the Soviet Union. During the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles, the committee led by Lord Curzon of Great Britain proposed a border based on ethnography—this is the famous \"Curzon Line.\" To the east of the line, the majority of the population were Belarusians and Ukrainians, but the feudal landlords were Polish. In 1920, the landlords launched a war against the Soviet Union, forcibly seizing areas that the Versailles Committee had decided did not belong to them. Until 1944, they were still provoking border disputes. Therefore, defeating the feudal power of the landlords was not only the first step in building a democratic Poland but also the first step in building a Poland that could coexist peacefully with the Soviet Union.\n\n    According to Poteld, the leader of the land reform, landlords owned two-thirds of the land in pre-war Poland. Of course, large families were relatively few, but they were the political leaders of the larger class of landlord gentry, who possessed the same feudal characteristics, even if to a lesser degree. Any farm over one hundred and twenty-five acres should be considered a large estate and distributed. In the case of Poland, such a large farm was usually cultivated by several generations of tenant farmers.\n\n    \"The purpose of land reform,\" he said when I caught Poteld for a ten-minute conversation once, \"is to give each farming family at least twelve acres of land. ...We want them to have enough land to support their families, and all in one place, and to get machinery and good breeds through cooperatives and government loans. Workshops run by local cooperatives should increase year-round work in the countryside. In addition, improvements in life will depend on the development of Polish industry.\"\n\n  The Complex Work of Land Distribution\n\n    The distribution of land was carried out under the leadership of a trinity: a county land commissioner appointed by the government, a village-elected peasant committee, and a volunteer working team of workers from the city to help promote the work.\n\n    One December morning, I took a truck to the Bozhamzhi estate, thirty miles from Lublin (in eastern Poland, which had been liberated by the Soviet Red Army and was the seat of the Polish Committee of National Liberation.—Editor). ...\n\n    The two thousand acres of land here originally belonged to an old man who died during the war, leaving behind a young widow. She did not live on the estate and rarely visited. She lived in Lublin, where she had two apartments. Half of the estate was forest, which had been nationalized. The remaining one thousand acres of land were distributed to fifty-seven tenant farmers who had always worked on the estate and poor farmers in three nearby villages.\n\n    In a room upstairs, a group of nine people gathered around a table. Each of the three villages elected two people, the tenants on the estate elected two people, and the remaining person was the chairman, appointed by the county land commissioner. These people made up the land distribution committee.\n\n    I saw them reviewing a list of about two hundred applicants, each of whom was thoroughly discussed. The committee had been meeting for a week and seemed likely to continue for some time. The land had been measured, which was a relatively easy technical task. The most delicate work was deciding which farmers should get the land.\n\n    An elderly man applied for land. He used to have twenty acres, but he sold it all and drank the proceeds. Now he had no land. Should he get land again? Of course not! But what about his innocent family, who urgently needed land? What about his youngest son, who joined the Polish army?\n\n    A father with four adult sons also asked for land. He only had one acre himself; but he used to have twenty-five acres, which he had distributed to his sons. According to custom, when sons get married, the old man must give land to his sons. But now three sons still lived in the old man's house, farming together. Was he really poor?\n\n    A capable young farmer said he only had three acres of land, but his neighbor said his daughter-in-law brought twelve acres of land as dowry from a nearby county.\n\n    \"You can check with her township government there,\" said the mayor who accompanied me.\n\n    \"Good heavens!\" the chairman exclaimed, \"I really need some help!\"\n\n    The procedures seemed very complicated. ... Although there were these individual complexities, after a week of debate, the grades had been specifically assessed by household. ...\n\n    In Bozhamzhi, all this complex work was just a small step in land reform. Before this, property registration had to be carried out, and at least a preliminary large amount of land was needed. Afterward, the county and provincial land bureaus had to review it. Throughout this process, various farmer meetings were held at any time, and mutual aid societies and cooperatives were organized to manage undistributable property, large warehouses, flour mills, and tractors on large estates.\n\n  Farmers Go to the Land Bureau to Appeal\n\n    At the Provincial Land Bureau on a street in Lublin, I sat in on their handling of inquiries from a large number of appellants. It was extremely informal there, and everyone rushed to appeal. In one hour, the secretary handled a surprising number of appellants.\n\n    A slow-moving woman wearing a brown headscarf bowed to the staff and explained that she had not been included on the list because she happened to be visiting her sister in another village when the application was held. She was a widow, her two sons were slaves in Germany, and she only had two acres of land. As a result, the Provincial Land Bureau gave her a letter asking the village to reconsider her case.\n\n    A very strong man asked for land and was refused because he drove a car in the city and wanted some extra property. If he was a rural worker, he was likely to ask for a share. It might not be as much as a farmer, or five acres, enough for him to farm part-time.\n\n    A county land commissioner rushed in, demanding a \"clear order\" to deal with the manager of an estate who was constantly drinking and squandering the property on the estate. \"We have a good undercover agent who doesn't drink who can take his place.\"\n\n    \"But this is a matter for the county land bureau, why come to us?\"\n\n    \"They don't recognize our orders, so we had to come to the higher authorities.\"\n\n    The provincial land commissioner pondered and co-signed the county commissioner's order. ...\n              (To be continued)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 波兰的土地改革\n史特朗\n1948-02-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    波兰的土地改革\n    史特朗作\n    李棣华译\n    这篇文章摘自美国记者史特朗女士所写的“我所见的新波兰”一书，所说的是一九四四年冬天的事。\n    当时波兰人民还正进行着抗德战争，波兰东部已经被苏军解放，波兰农民在波兰工人党（波共）与民族解放委员会领导下，分配了占波兰国土五分之一的土地。在这基础上，他们打败了德国法西斯匪军，建立了新波兰。正如译者李棣华同志在译本的卷头语中所说的，“我们必须估计到近二年来波兰土地改革运动的新发展。”由于土地改革的深入，广大群众的觉醒，波兰新民主政权就日益巩固，使美英帝国主义者所扶植的残余的反动分子也滚出了波兰。（“我所见的新波兰”一书由李棣华同志译出后已在华北新华书店出版，全书十余万言，这里摘录的只是其中的一小部分。）\n        ——编者        \n    谁都知道改变封建的土地关系是必要的。在波兰，这种改变还有国际理由。过去二十五年间，封建土地权使得波兰和苏联间的边疆纠纷复杂化起来。在凡尔赛和约的谈判中，英国寇松爵士所领导的委员会建议了根据人种学的边界——这就是有名的“寇松线”。在线的东面，大部分的人口是白俄罗斯人和乌克兰人，但封建地主却是波兰人。在一九二○年，地主们发动了对苏联的战争，用武力攫取了凡尔赛委员会决定不属于他们的地区。直到一九四四年，他们还仍在挑动着边疆的论争。所以，打垮地主们的封建势力不仅是建设一个民主波兰的首要步骤，也是建立一个与苏联和平共居的波兰的首要步骤。\n    据土地改革的领袖波特耳德说，在战前波兰三分之二的土地是地主所占有的。大家族当然是比较少的，但他们却是更多数的地主士绅阶级的政治领袖，这些地主士绅具备着同样的封建性质，即使是比较少的话。凡在一百二十五英亩以上的农庄，都应当作大田庄来分配的。在波兰的情况下，一个那样大的农庄普通都是由辈辈相传的几家佃农去耕种的。\n    “土地改革的目的，”当我一次抓住波特耳德作了十分钟谈话的时候，他说道：“是至少要给每个农家十二英亩的土地。…………我们要他们有足够养家的土地，还要在一块，并且经过合作社和政府贷款得到机器和优良品种。地方合作社经营的作坊等要在乡间提高整年不断的工作。此外，生活的改善就得依赖于发展波兰的工业了。”\n  分配土地的复杂工作\n    分配土地是在三位一体的领导下进行的：政府委派的县土地特派员，村里选举的农民委员会，和自愿从城市来协助促进工作的工人工作队。\n    在一个十二月的清晨，我乘卡车往离卢布林（在波兰东部，当时已被苏联红军解放，是波兰民族解放委员会所在地。——编者）三十英里的波札姆兹大田庄去。……………\n    这里的两千英亩土地原来是属于一个老头子的，他在战争中死了，留下一个青年寡妇。她不在田庄上居住，也很少来看看的。她住在卢布林，那里她有两所公寓。这块田庄的一半是森林，已经归了公。下剩的一千英亩土地是由一向在田庄上作活的五十七个佃农和附近三个村里的贫苦农民来分的。\n    在楼上一间屋子里，一个九人小组聚集在一个桌子的周围。三个村子每村选两人，本庄上的佃农选两人，其余一人是主席，是县土地特派员所委派的。这些人就组成土地分配委员会。\n    我见他们正在审查二百来个申请人的名单，每个申请人都要经过彻底讨论的。委员会已经开了一个星期的会，好象还要一直继续开下去。土地已经丈量过了，这样的技术工作是比较容易的。最细腻的工作是决定那些农民应该得到土地。\n    一个老年人申请要土地。他从前有二十英亩，他都卖光了，拿地价喝了酒，现在他是没有地的。他应该再得到土地吗？当然不啦！可是他的无辜的迫切需要土地的家庭怎么办呢？参加了波兰军的最小的儿子又该怎样办呢？\n    有四个成年儿子的父亲也要求分地。他自己只有一英亩；可是从前有过二十五英亩，都分给他的儿子们了。按习惯，儿子们结婚的时候，老汉必须分地给儿子们的。可是，现在三个儿子还住在老汉的家里，共同种地的。他是真穷了吗？\n    一个精干的青年农民说他只有三英亩地，他的邻家却说他的媳妇带了在附近县里的十二亩地作嫁奁。\n    “你们可以向她那里的镇公所调查一下。”陪我来的镇长说。\n    “天哪！”主席大声说，“我真得要个帮忙呢！”\n    手续好象很复杂，………虽然有这些个别的复杂情况，一个星期争论的结果，已经按户具体评定了等级。……………\n    在波札姆兹，所有这一切复杂的工作，只是土地改革中一个小的步骤。在这以前，必须进行财产登记，并且至少也得初步大量土地。以后，就得由县与省土地局进行审查。在这整个的过程中，随时召开各种农民会议，组织互助社和合作社去管理不能分配的财产，大仓库，面粉厂，和大田庄上的拖拉机。\n  农民到土地局去申诉\n    在卢布林一条街上的省土地局里，我旁听了他们对于大批申诉人的查询处理。那里极不拘形式，大家争先恐后地来申诉。在一个钟头里，秘书便处理了使人惊奇的大量申诉人。\n    一个＠着棕色头巾举止迟慢的妇人，对工作员鞠躬打招呼，说明她没有被列到名单里边，因为在举行申请的时候，她恰巧到另一个村子看她妹妹去了。她是一个寡妇，她的两个儿子在德国当了奴隶，她只有二英亩土地。结果，省土地局给了她一封信，让村里重新考虑她的问题。\n    一个很壮实人要求土地，被拒绝了，因为他在城里开汽车，想要点额外的财产。如果他是乡村工人的话，他很可能要求到一份。这倒不一定象农民那样多，或者是五英亩，够他部分时间耕种的。\n    一个县的土地特派员急急忙忙地跑进来，要求“明令”去处理一个田庄的管理人，他经常喝酒，在挥霍着田庄上的财产。“我们有个不吃酒的好便衣队员可以接替他的工作。”\n    “但这是县土地局的事情，为什么找我们来呢？”\n    “他们不承认我们的命令，所以我们只好找上级来了。”\n    省土地特派员沉吟着，在县特派员的命令上连署了名字。…………\n              （未完）"

    "content": "\"Caring for the Poor Hired Labor\" Harms Middle Peasants:\n    Xiliuquan's Approach Should Be Changed\n    [Shahe News] When Xiliuquan in the fourth district of Shahe established a credit cooperative, it called on the masses to raise shares. Of the 67 households in the village, 41 households were middle peasants, upper-middle peasants, and those who had been struggled against, and 26 were poor peasants. The households above the middle peasant level raised a total of 284,650 yuan in shares. When the village cadres saw that the shares were all from middle peasants and there was no money for poor peasants to raise shares, the village chief said: Our village has a blacksmith shop and a cooperative. This year, each yuan of shares can yield one yuan in dividends in the second half of the year. The shares of the blacksmith shop and the cooperative totaled 2,245,000 yuan. Let's have the credit cooperative shares and the cooperative shares collectively distribute dividends. The shares of the middle and upper-middle peasants will account for two-thirds, and the poor peasants will account for one-third. The government proposes to take care of the poor hired laborers. If the poor hired laborers do not have shares, how can they distribute dividends? After research, the village cadres asked the poor hired laborers to borrow money from the credit cooperative and then use it to buy shares in the credit cooperative. The monthly interest rate for poor peasants' loans is two percent, and each yuan of shares can yield one yuan in dividends. They started in October and distributed dividends after two months in December. The poor hired laborers thought, \"I'll go to the credit cooperative to borrow money and then buy shares.\" The poor hired laborers said: \"We have money to buy shares, and we can also get dividends.\" Eighteen poor peasant households borrowed a total of 154,000 yuan and all bought shares. (Yuan Junxian, Zhang Xiuhai, Shahe Sub-branch)\n    The village cadres want to seek some benefits for the poor hired laborers, which is a good intention. However, borrowing money from the credit cooperative for the poor hired laborers, with low interest, and then buying shares with high dividends, those who suffer are the middle peasants who invest more. If the middle peasants suffer losses, they will inevitably be dissatisfied, which is not good for the poor hired laborers. We suggest that we still find ways to borrow money from banks or cooperatives to organize the poor hired laborers to actively produce, which is the correct way to solve the problem.\n——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “照顾贫雇”伤害中农  西柳泉的作法应该改变\n元俊贤  张秀海\n1948-02-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    “照顾贫雇”伤害中农\n    西柳泉的作法应该改变\n    【沙河消息】沙河四区西柳泉成立信用部时，号召群众集股。全村六十七户，中农、上中农和被斗户共四十一户，贫农二十六户，中农以上的户集股共二十八万四千六百五十元。村干部看了股金都是中农的，贫农没有钱集股，村长说：咱村有个铁匠炉，还有合作社，今年后半年股金一元能分红一元。铁匠炉和合作社的股金共二百二十四万五千元，咱们让信用部股金与合作社股金集体分红，中农、上中农的股金就占三分之二，贫农占三分之一，政府提出叫照顾贫雇，贫雇没有股金，如何分红利？村干部经过研究，叫贫雇从信用部贷出款来，再入到信用部顶股金。贫雇贷款月利是二分，股金分红每元能分红一元。从十月份搞起来，到十二月两个月的时间就分红。贫雇想这我就到信用部去贷款，再入股。贫雇说：有钱集股金了，也能分红了。有贫雇十八户，共贷款一十五万四千元，都入了股金。（沙河支行元俊贤、张秀海）\n    村干部想给贫雇谋些利益，这是一片好心，但是，从信用部给贫雇贷出钱，利息少，再去入股，红利大，吃亏的是入股多的中农。中农吃亏，必然不满意，对贫雇没有好处。我们建议，还是设法从银行或合作社贷上款，组织贫雇积极生产，才是正确解决问题的道路。          ——编者"

    "title": "Unified Mutual Aid Dividend: Poor and Hired Laborers Suffer Great Losses; Taihang Discovers Formalism in Winter Production",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-06",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Taihang News: In many villages in the Third Special District and counties like Wuxiang, winter production has not started from the actual needs of hired and poor laborers. Satisfied with subjective desires and formalistic practices, hired and poor laborers have suffered great losses and are dissatisfied and unmotivated. Summarizing the situation, there are three scenarios: The first is the unified mutual aid and unified dividend distribution for various sideline productions. In Qingcaoao, Third District of Pingshun, winter production is under the unified leadership of the land cooperative (an organization similar to agricultural production teams from last year) for sideline shares (excluding women). Accounts are settled once every three months, and dividends are distributed based on each household's invested capital and labor, with an 80/20 split between labor and capital. The leadership believes this method is excellent, but hired laborer Shi Qizhi said: \"The money earned from transportation, oil mills, charcoal burning, and weaving is all handed over to the sideline share. It takes three months to receive dividends, making it difficult for the poor to survive!\" Ten hired and poor households in the village are currently lacking food. Some want to do more transportation but lack travel expenses (all travel expenses are self-provided). Borrowing from the credit cooperative requires daily interest. Conversely, the earned freight cannot cover the cost. As a result, only those with travel expenses can do more transportation and receive more dividends. The hired and poor laborers' assessment of this old method is: \"Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst; it only benefits the wealthy!\" Cadres in Qiaoshang Village, Sixth District of Huguan, insisted on combining transportation, shop-keeping, and wartime support, subjectively prescribing a unified dividend distribution based on the amount of work done. In reality, sideline production is complex, and production methods and profits vary. Taking transportation as an example, the items transported differ, and the earnings also vary. Unified dividend distribution based on work points resulted in some suffering losses and others benefiting. Hired laborer Li Qiaocheng earned an average of 222 yuan per half-day by transporting medicine and bringing back vinegar. Middle peasant Li Bingwu earned an average of only 94 yuan per half-day by transporting medicine and bringing back corn. With unified dividend distribution per half-day, averaging 149 yuan, Bingwu received 54 yuan more than Qiaocheng, while Qiaocheng received 73 yuan less. After calculating the accounts and distributing the dividends, Qiaocheng became unmotivated in transportation. In addition, the transportation team earned 144 yuan per half-day, while the shop earned only 44 yuan per half-day. With unified dividend distribution, averaging 81 yuan per half-day, the transportation team suffered a great loss and became demoralized. Hired laborer Li Hehua, who owns a shop, used to earn one or two thousand yuan a day. However, the cadres emphasized work exchange and combination, forcing unification. Now Hehua cannot receive as much money, and demands the cancellation of the combined dividend distribution. Worse still, some village cadres decided to prioritize profitable production like saltpeter boiling for hired and poor laborers, but then implemented combination with transportation and other activities, and unified dividend distribution, thus taking away the extra money earned by the hired and poor laborers. This foolish practice is most dissatisfying to the hired and poor laborers.\n\nThe second scenario involves extracting bonus money from the mutual aid production dividends. Many villages in Lucheng, Huguan, and Licheng counties forcibly extract one-tenth (such as Qiaoshang in Huguan) or four percent (Shanghuang in Lucheng) of the dividends to reward so-called \"activists.\" The masses disagree with this practice of rewarding a few individuals with the money earned by everyone. Especially since the so-called activists are often leaders of mutual aid organizations, or people close to the leadership, and these people are mostly from the middle peasant class or above. Therefore, the hired and poor laborers who lack food, clothing, and capital are even more dissatisfied with this practice. In addition, the Henghe Zhai Manxi iron smelting group in the Fourth District of Changzhi, in order to \"consolidate\" work exchange, decided to extract one-tenth of the dividends as a fixed fund, preparing to engage in other sideline occupations in the future. This only suits the tastes of wealthy households, and the hired and poor peasants who have not yet turned themselves around and are currently struggling with their lives disagree. They demand: \"Use the earned money to fill the gaps,\" or immediately use it all as capital for reproduction.\n\nThe third scenario involves unfair work exchange methods in women's spinning and weaving mutual aid. Macun Village, Third District of Wuxiang, is a village with a foundation in spinning and weaving, but hired and poor women are not very enthusiastic about winter spinning. At a meeting of hired and poor women, everyone unanimously reflected: \"Our skills are poor, and most of us don't know how to weave. Exchanging work with women who know how to weave requires spinning half a catty of cotton for every catty of cloth woven. In reality, they can weave two catties of cloth a day, while we can only spin a little more than five taels of cotton a day, taking three days to repay their one day of work. Suffering such a great loss, how can we be motivated to participate in mutual aid?\" The labor accounting in Dongzhuang, Seventh District of Qinyang, is also unfairly stipulated: spinning one tael of thread is only equivalent to one work point, and only four taels can be spun in a day, while weaving one bolt of cloth (taking two days) is equivalent to fourteen work points. A spinner loses one and a half work points when exchanging for one bolt of cloth. This situation is very unreasonable, and hired and poor women demand a change in this practice.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 统一互助分红  贫雇吃了大亏  太行发现冬季生产中的形式主义\n\n1948-02-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    统一互助分红  贫雇吃了大亏\n    太行发现冬季生产中的形式主义\n    【太行消息】三专区和武乡等县不少村庄的冬季生产，因领导上未从雇贫的实际要求出发，满足于主观愿望形式主义的一套做法，雇贫吃亏很大，都不满意不起劲。综合起来，有三种情形：头一种是各种各样的副业生产统一互助，统一分红。平顺三区青草凹的冬季生产，是土地合作社（去年农业生产时候的一种组织）里的副业股统一领导（妇女不在内），三个月才算一次帐，按各家所入资金及劳力，劳八资二分红。领导上对这种办法，认为很好，可是，雇贫史其枝却说：“运输、油坊、烧炭、编造赚下的钱，都交到副业股，等三个月才能分红，当下穷苦人就困难的不能过活呀！”该村当下就有十户雇贫没吃的；有的打算多去运输却没盘费（盘费都是自备），到信用社借吧，借一天有一天利；反过来，赚下的脚价可不能顶用。结果，只好叫有盘费的人去多运输多分红。雇贫们给这种旧办法的评价是：“远水解不了近渴，光叫人家有法户喝吧！”壶关六区桥上村干部，硬要实行运输开店战勤三大结合，主观订了按活计工统一分红等一套办法。实际上，副业生产复杂，生产门路和利润都不一样；就运输来说，担的东西不同，赚钱多少也不同，统一按工分红，就有的吃了亏，有的占了便宜。雇贫李巧成走时担碗药石，回来捎醋，每晌平均赚二百二十二元；中农李丙午，走时也担碗药石，回来捎玉茭，每晌平均只赚九十四元；按晌统一分红，平均每晌分一百四十九元，丙午每晌就多分巧成五十四元，巧在每晌少分七十三元，经过算帐分红后，巧成运输不积极啦。另外，运输队每晌赚洋一百四十四元，在家开店每晌只赚洋四十四元，统一分红，每晌平均分红八十一元，运输队吃了大亏，也都干的泄了气。雇贫李何花自己开的一座店房，以前一天能赚一两千，可是干部强调变工结合，硬统一起来，现在何花就分不上那么多钱，要求取消结合分红。更糟的是有些村庄的干部，也决定尽先让贫雇搞熬硝等赚利大的生产，可是又实行和运输等结合，统一分红，又把雇贫多赚的钱分走了。这种哄傻子的做法，雇贫最不满意。第二种是从互助生产红利中抽奖励金。潞城、壶关、黎城等县不少村庄，硬抽十分之一（如壶关桥上）或百分之四（潞城上黄）的红利，去奖励什么“积极分子”，群众是不同意这种把大家赚来的钱奖了少数人的做法的。尤其因为所谓积极分子往往是互助组织的领导者，或与领导上接近的人，而这些人大都是中农以上阶层，所以没吃、没穿、没本钱的雇贫，更不满意这种做法。另外，长治四区横河翟满喜铁炉组，更为了“巩固”变工，决定抽出十分之一的红利作不动基金，准备将来搞其他副业；这只是适合富裕户的口味，而没翻身的、当前生活就很困难的雇贫农是不同意的，他们要求：“赚下钱补窟窿”，或马上都作为再生产的本钱。第三种是妇女纺织互助中，纺和织的变工办法不公道；武乡三区马村是纺织有基础的村庄，但雇贫妇女冬纺劲头不大。在雇贫妇女检查会上，大家一致反映：“咱技术差，多数人不会织布。和人家会织布的妇女变工，规定是织一斤布纺半斤花，实际上，人家一天能织二斤布，咱一天最多纺五两多花，三天才能还完人家一个工。象吃这大亏，还能互助的有劲？”沁阳七区东庄纺织计工也规定的不公道：纺一两线才顶一分工，一天只能纺四两，而织一匹布（用两天）就顶十四分工；纺妇换织一匹布就亏工一个半；这种情况很不合理，雇贫妇女要求改变这种作法。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Comprehensive news from various sources: The Chiang government has recently promulgated and implemented a new economic measure, stipulating that during the period when banks stop industrial and commercial loans, the banks and treasuries of the four major families will purchase finished products and raw materials from various factories. The Chiang bandit's Joint Treasury has formulated \"Temporary Measures for Shanghai National (Four Major Families) Banks and Treasuries to Purchase Finished Products on Behalf of the (Chiang) Government,\" and since the 30th of last month, the Chiang bandit's banks and treasuries have begun accepting applications from manufacturers for \"purchase\" cases. This \"purchase\" will also begin soon in Peiping and Tianjin, and it is stipulated that the \"purchase\" price will \"in principle be based on the average market price for the six days prior to the date of approval of the application.\" This fully proves that the real purpose of the so-called \"stopping loans to prevent speculation and hoarding\" implemented by the Chiang government since November of last year is only to attack private industry and commerce, so that the four major families can further monopolize production in the Chiang-controlled areas and make greater speculative profits.\n\nSince the Chiang bandits implemented the suspension of loans, private industry and commerce have suffered severely. Manufacturers have been forced to rely on high-interest black market loans to survive due to capital difficulties. Industrial groups in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin have all requested the Chiang bandit authorities to immediately resume loans. The Chiang government not only ignored this, but also took advantage of the fact that manufacturers needed money more urgently during the Lunar New Year holiday and faced a more serious crisis. On the one hand, it insisted on its principle of \"definitely not considering resuming loans before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month,\" and on the other hand, it issued banknotes in large quantities to purchase and hoard physical goods at low prices, in order to sell them at higher prices and make huge profits. Private industry is further plunged into a desperate situation of bankruptcy and being annexed under the two steps of \"stopping loans\" and \"purchasing\" by the Chiang bandits.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Private factories in Qingdao are closing down one after another. According to the Qingdao industrial and commercial delegation that recently went to Nanjing to petition the Chiang bandits, the reasons for the closure of factories in the city are: the Chiang bandit officials monopolize fuel, resulting in a lack of power; restrictions on foreign exchange quotas increase the cost of raw materials; more importantly, the Chiang bandits levy heavy taxes regardless of how much the manufacturers lose. At present, less than 40% of the factories in Qingdao are operating, and some of them are operating only half-time or intermittently. According to a Hong Kong magazine, as early as June of last year, 38 dyeing and weaving factories in Qingdao had closed down, and in July, dozens of rubber, hardware, and general merchandise businesses also went bankrupt one after another. The Chinese-owned match factory, which employed 20,000 workers, has also almost completely shut down. The local Chiang bandit government's gazette admits that among the city's 700,000 people, 100,000 workers have lost their jobs and can only fill their stomachs with chaff and tree bark.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪打击民营工商业  贱价“收购”工业成品  进一步垄断蒋区生产\n\n1948-02-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    蒋匪打击民营工商业\n    贱价“收购”工业成品  进一步垄断蒋区生产\n    【新华社陕北三日电】综合各方消息：蒋政府近又颁布实行一项经济新措施，规定在银行停止工商贷款期间，由四大家族的银行局库收购各工厂制成品及原料品。蒋匪四联总处已订定“上海国家（四大家族）行局代（蒋）政府收购成品临时办法”，并自上月三十日起蒋匪各银行局库已开始接受厂商申请“收购”案件办理收购。平津方面也即将开始此项“收购”，且规定“收购”价格“依核准申请之日期前六日平均市价为原则”。此事充分证明：蒋政府去年十一月以来实行之所谓“停止贷款以防投机囤积”，其真正目的只是打击民营工商业，便于四大家族进一步垄断蒋区生产，作更大投机牟利而已。\n    蒋匪自实行停止贷款以来，民营工商业惨遭打击，各厂商均因资金困难被迫依赖高利黑市贷款苟延残喘，沪、平、津各地工业团体均曾要求蒋匪当局立即恢复贷款，蒋政府不但置之不理，反借此旧历年关各厂商需款更急、面临更严重危机之时，一面坚持其“旧历正月十五日前决不考虑恢复贷款”之原则，一面又滥发纸币大量贱价搜购囤积实物，以便在物价更高时抛售谋取厚利。而民营工业便在蒋匪“停贷”“收购”两个步骤下，进一步陷入破产与被并吞的绝境。\n    【新华社陕北三日电】青岛民间工厂纷纷停闭。据最近赴南京向蒋匪请愿之青岛工商业代表团透露，该市工厂停闭原因为：蒋匪官方垄断燃料，致动力缺乏；限制外汇额，使其原料成本增高；更重要者，为蒋匪不管各厂商如何亏折，尚勒收重税。现青市工厂开工者尚不及百分之四十，其中若干且系半开工和处于时断时续状态。又据香港某杂志载：青市远在去年六月即有染织厂三十八家停业，七月份又有橡皮、五金及百货业数十家相继倒闭。拥有二万工人的华商火柴厂亦几乎全部歇业。当地蒋匪政府公报供认：在全市七十万人口中，已有十万工人失业，彼等只能以糠和叶树皮充饥。"

Under the command of the executioner Xuan Tie-wu, commander of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' Songhu garrison, they surrounded the factory with tanks and armored vehicles, and used fierce firepower from American-style machine guns and rifles and bayonets to carry out a cruel massacre of unarmed male and female workers. More than 60 male and female workers were killed and injured, and more than 300 were arrested (Associated Press). Among them, two female workers were trampled to death by Chiang Kai-shek bandit police, and another female worker was thrown from the third floor to her death by Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

Since the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale winter offensive, it has annihilated more than 58,000 enemy troops, recovered ten county towns and many important strongholds in a month and a half. This has not only led the war to the periphery of Shenyang, but also completely cut off the Chiang bandit's blood transfusion arteries. The important strongholds of the Chiang bandits such as Jinzhou and Yingkou are also increasingly exposed to our army. Chiang Kai-shek has transferred Fan Hanjie's army group, which was badly beaten by the East China People's Liberation Army, from Shandong to provide emergency relief, but Fan Hanjie's end will not be more brilliant than Wang Tiehan's.\n\nA unit of our army in the Jin-Cha-Ji area, from January 18th to 21st, successively swept away the bandit and puppet Wang Fenggang's troops north of the Daqing River and successively recovered more than ten important villages and towns in Xiong County and Ba County, killing and capturing more than 670 enemy troops and destroying all the fortresses painstakingly built by the Wang bandits north of the Daqing River, and his plan to control the Xiong (County), Ba (County), and Xin (City) areas has completely failed.\n\nSouthern Front: The People's Liberation Army, in coordination with local armed forces and militia, continued to widely suppress Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and capture local bullies. In the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region, more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops and local bullies were successively annihilated and captured in Huangmei, Huang'an, and Yingshan in eastern Hubei, and Huoshan, Taihu, and Shucheng in western Anhui. On the 27th, Xixian County, on the north bank of the Huai River, was captured again, and the defending security team fled in panic. On both sides of the Longhai Railway in western Henan, our army annihilated more than 800 Chiang Kai-shek's local bandits in half a month from the 2nd to the 16th of last month, and once recovered Mianchi County on the 12th. Our local troops in Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu separately suppressed scattered bandits in Guoyang, Ningling, and Dangshan between the Ying River and the Huai River, killing and capturing more than 1,400 people in one month.\n\nLocal armed guerrillas in various places are also extremely active. In the coastal areas of northern Jiaodong, our guerrillas actively besieged Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in Penglai, Yantai, and Weihaiwei, and launched a struggle against grain robbery, annihilating more than 300 enemy troops in the past month. Last month, on the 15th, the local troops of the Huaihai Sub-district in Central China launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in the triangular area of the Longhai Railway, Suqian-Xin'anzhen Road, and the Grand Canal. On the same day, another unit of our army completely annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek's Taizhou Joint Defense Brigade on the Hai'an-Taizhou Line, killing and capturing more than 650 enemy troops in the two battles. On the 8th of last month, the Bohai Sea Defense Detachment, in coordination with the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army's large-scale raid, fiercely attacked Donggu, southeast of Tianjin, capturing more than 300 enemy troops and capturing strongholds such as Xiaozhan, Xianshuigu, and Gegu. The local armed forces in northern Jin repelled the intrusion of Yan Xishan's bandits in Xin County and approached the city of Xin County. The Jinzhong local armed forces crossed the Taiyuan-Fenyang Highway and launched widespread attacks in Yangqu, Qingyuan, Taiyuan, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, and Fenyang, attacking Yan Xishan's bandits, searching for Yan Xishan's henchmen, and rescuing the suffering people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一周综合战报\n\n1948-02-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    一周综合战报\n    一月二十九日至本月四日一周综合战报：\n    北线方面：东北解放军于上月二十六日攻克沈阳以西二百余里之蒋匪战略要镇，及铁路交叉点新立屯。守敌四十九军二十六师九千余人全部受歼。敌四十九军自去秋由该军军长王铁汉率领三个师奉命增援东北以来，时仅半年，至此全军覆没。二十七日另部解放军进驻北宁线重要联接点沟帮子，三十一日继克盘山县城，同日又攻占锦州东北三十余里北宁线上之重要桥梁大凌河，以上三次战斗共歼敌一八四师等部一千九百余名。东北解放军自展开大规模冬季攻势作战以来，一个半月之间，共歼敌五万八千余，收复县城十座，及重要据点多处，不仅使战争引向沈阳外围，蒋匪输血动脉全被斩断，锦州营口等蒋匪重要据点，亦日益裸露在我大军面前。蒋匪由山东增调被华东解放军打得头破血流的范汉杰兵团前往救急，但范汉杰的下场并不会比王铁汉高妙。\n    晋察冀我军一部自上月十八日至二十一日，连续扫荡大清河北匪伪王凤岗部并相继收复雄霸两城及重要村镇十余处，毙俘敌六百七十余人，摧毁王匪在大清河北苦心修筑之所有堡垒，而其控制雄（县）霸（县）新（城）地区之计划全告破产。\n    南线方面：解放军配合地方武装、民兵继续广泛清剿蒋匪、捕捉土顽。鄂豫皖地区先后在鄂东之黄梅、黄安、英山，皖西之霍山、太湖、舒城等地境内歼捕蒋匪正规军土顽千余。二十七日再度攻克淮河北岸之息县城，守敌保安队落荒而逃。豫西陇海路两侧我军自上月二日至十六日半月间歼蒋记土顽八百余人，并于十二日一度收复渑池县城。豫皖苏我地方部队分别清剿颍水淮河间涡阳、宁陵、砀山等地散匪，一月内共毙俘一千四百余人。\n    各地地方武装游击队亦极为活跃，胶东北海边沿地区我游击队积极围困蓬莱、烟台、威海卫市北等地蒋匪，并展开反抢粮斗争，一月来共歼敌三百多人。华中淮海分区地方部队上月十五日大举进剿陇海路、宿（迁）新（安镇）路、运河线三角地带之蒋匪，同日另部我军于海（安）泰（州）线上全歼蒋匪泰州联防大队，两役共毙俘敌六百五十余人。上月八日渤海海防支队配合晋察冀解放军大破击战，猛攻天津东南之东沽，俘敌三百余人，并攻克小站、咸水沽、葛沽等据点。晋北地方武装击退忻县阎匪侵扰，并逼近忻县城下。晋中地武越过太（原）汾（阳）公路，在阳曲、清源、太原、交城、文水、汾阳一带展开广泛出击，打击阎匪，搜捕阎匪爪牙，拯救受难人民。（新华社）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: Comprehensive reports: U.S. imperialism is intensifying its efforts to split the world workers' movement through notorious American labor traitors. However, this conspiracy has been met with a strong counterattack from the world working class and is failing repeatedly. According to various sources, U.S. imperialism has chosen the following three centers in an attempt to achieve its goal of splitting the world workers' movement:\n\nFirst, attacking the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). Last November, Galen, one of the right-wing leaders of the American CIO, suggested to the WFTU Executive Committee that it support the Marshall Plan, but this was rejected. Subsequently, U.S. imperialist agents Green, Dubinsky, and Brown, through the U.S. imperialist lackey Bevin, instigated the British TUC at the WFTU Executive Committee meeting held in mid-month to pressure the WFTU to accept a proposal to support the Marshall Plan. When this failed, they ordered it to withdraw from the WFTU and form a new \"world trade union organization\" with sixteen Western European countries, in an attempt to disintegrate the WFTU. However, this activity by the American and British labor traitors has aroused strong opposition from organized workers in France, Britain, Poland, and other countries. A movement to resist the splitting of the WFTU is emerging. The Soviet magazine New Times recently stated in a commentary: \"The great power of the organized labor masses will certainly repel any attempt to split the unity of the WFTU.\"\n\nSecond, undermining the unity of trade unions in Western Europe, especially in Britain and France. To this end, U.S. imperialism has established CIO offices in European countries, headed by Brown and others, which have become the guiding center for undermining the labor movement in these countries. For example, in Britain, with the support of U.S. imperialism, Labor Party leaders Philip and others launched the \"Anti-Communist Crusade\" movement to split the labor movement at the end of last year, instigating the re-election of trade union leaders in an attempt to expel the British Communist Party from the trade unions. But this conspiracy has failed. For example, all five British Communist members of the National Union of Mineworkers South Wales Executive Committee were re-elected, and many unions have expressed confidence in the leadership of the British Communist Party. \"The response to Philip's anti-communist call was a chorus of protests\" (TASS). In France, U.S. imperialism bought out Jouhaux and directed him to break away from the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) and form a so-called \"Workers' Force\" reactionary trade union in an attempt to split the CGT. However, \"trade unions across the country are firmly loyal to the CGT, and workers who were deceived and lured out have returned to the CGT in droves\" (l'Humanité, January 28). Of particular importance is the continued support of the National Federation of Tobacco and Match Workers' Unions (whose general secretary had agreed to join \"Workers' Force\" and Jouhaux had a great influence in this union) for the CGT, which proves how unbreakable the unity of the French working class is.\n\nThird, splitting or controlling trade union organizations in the Americas to serve as tools for American monopoly capital. The AFL spent $2 million in an attempt to split the progressive \"Latin American Labor Confederation,\" but this attempt also failed. The AFL convened a so-called \"Pan-American Trade Union Conference\" in the Peruvian capital on January 10, but it ended without result due to the refusal of labor confederations from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Paraguay to participate, which demonstrates \"the determination of Latin American workers to resist U.S. imperialist policies\" (commentary in a Lima newspaper). Domestically, U.S. imperialism is intensifying its anti-communist activities, and has successively unreasonably arrested three leaders of the American Communist Party, including Bittman. On the other hand, it is trying every means to \"merge the CIO into the AFL with the help of right-wing CIO leaders\" (TASS, January 27). At the same time, taking advantage of the right-wing's dominant position on the CIO Executive Board, it formally passed a resolution on January 27 that labor organizations should not support third-party candidates. This move has provoked rejection from eleven progressive local unions, including the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, and even the Associated Press admitted: \"If the left wing refuses to abide by the decision, there is absolutely nothing the Executive Board can do.\" Currently, the anti-split struggle within the CIO is unfolding.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: Reports from various sources: The world working class and progressive public opinion are rising up to oppose the U.S. imperialist plot to split the World Federation of Trade Unions. To this end, the French CGT issued a special communiqué on the 1st, pointing out that for more than two years, reactionary leaders of the American AFL and their European agent Brown have been launching intense propaganda against the WFTU, trying to split the trade unions participating in the WFTU. The communiqué denounced that \"the emergence of the French split movement 'Workers' Force' is related to the anti-labor conspiracy of international reactionaries.\" The communiqué stated that the request by some members of the WFTU to include the discussion of the Marshall Plan on the agenda of the upcoming WFTU Executive Committee meeting is a new threat to the unity of the workers' movement. The communiqué exposed that the reason why supporters of the Marshall Plan want to undermine the unity of the labor movement is because \"the unity of the labor movement is the main obstacle to the implementation of this plan.\" The communiqué warned: \"The attempt to split the WFTU is increasing recently, and the WFTU must expose the true face of its enemies\"; the communiqué condemned the reactionary stance taken by Jouhaux and his group in betraying the working class, and firmly opposed \"the WFTU discussing the Marshall Plan.\" The Polish Trade Union Council passed a resolution on the 1st condemning the attempt by U.S. imperialist lackeys to split the world workers' movement. The resolution stated: \"The Central Committee of the Polish Trade Union, which has 2.8 million members, firmly protests against turning the WFTU into a tool of imperialism,\" and called on \"trade union members around the world to rise up and defend the unity of the WFTU as they would defend their own eyes.\" Trade unions and democrats in many countries \"expressed extreme anger at the sabotage by the American and British reactionaries of the unity of the trade union movement, which was achieved through the hard struggle of the working class\" (TASS). British democratic public opinion has condemned the recent betrayal by the British TUC Central Committee. The Daily Worker pointed out on January 30: \"The TUC Central Committee's decision to convene a separate meeting of trade unions in countries directly related to the Marshall Plan to discuss the Marshall Plan\" proves that \"the TUC has sided with the right-wing leaders of the American AFL.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 世界工人阶级紧密团结  打败美帝分裂职工运动阴谋\n\n1948-02-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    世界工人阶级紧密团结\n    打败美帝分裂职工运动阴谋\n    【新华社陕北五日电】综合报导：美帝国主义正通过美国著名的工贼，加紧进行分裂世界职工运动。但此种阴谋活动，已遭受世界工人阶级的有力反击而节节失败。据各方消息：美帝国主义选择了如下的三个中心，妄图达到分裂世界职工运动的目的：\n    第一、进攻世界职工联盟。美国产联右派头子之一加莱，去年十一月中旬曾向世职执委会建议支持马歇尔计划，结果被否决了。此后，美帝代理人格林、杜宾斯基与布朗等人，即通过美帝走狗贝文，嗾使英总工会于本月中旬召开的世职执委会上，压迫世职接受支持马歇尔计划的提案，此计不成，即令其退出世职，并与西欧十六国另组新的“世界职工机构”，妄图瓦解世职。但美英工贼们的此种活动，已激起法、英、波等国有组织工人的强烈反对，一个抵抗分裂世职的运动正在兴起，苏联新时代杂志近在评论中力称：“有组织的劳动群众的巨大力量，一定能击退任何分裂世职团结的图谋”。\n    第二、破坏西欧特别是英、法等国职工会的团结。美帝为此，在欧洲国家设立了劳联办事处，由布朗等主持，成为破坏这些国家工运的指导中心。例如在英国，在美帝的支持下，工党头子菲力浦等于去年底发动了分裂工运的“反共十字军”运动，策动改选工会的领导，企图将英共从职工会中赶出去。但这一阴谋已告破产。例如全国矿工联盟南威士执委会五位英共执委，在改选中都得到连任，许多工会都表示信任英共之领导。“回答菲力浦反共号召的，是一片抗议声”（塔斯社）。在法国，美帝收买了石屋，并指使他脱离总工会并另组所谓“工人力量”的反动职工会，力图分裂总工会。但是“全国各工会都坚决忠于总工会，被骗引诱出去的工人已纷纷重返总工会”（一月二十八日人道报），尤其重要的便是烟草火柴工会全国联合委员会（这一工会总书记已赞成参加“工人力量”，且石屋在这一工会中影响极大）的继续支持总工会，这证明法国工人阶级的团结是如何牢不可破。\n    第三、分裂或控制美洲各国的职工组织，作为美国独占资本的御用工具，劳联曾花费了二百万美元，企图分裂进步的“拉丁美洲劳工联盟”，但这一企图也破产了。劳联在上月十日在秘鲁首都召开所谓“泛美职工大会”，因阿根廷、巴西、乌拉圭、玻璃维亚、巴拉圭等国劳工联盟之拒绝参加，终于无结果而散，这显示“拉丁美洲工人反抗美帝国主义政策的决心”（里马报纸评语）。美帝在国内一方面加紧进行反共活动，并先后无理拘捕毕特曼等美共领袖三人；另一方面则正千方百计“通过产联右翼首领的帮助，将产联并入劳联”（塔斯社一月二十七日电）。同时利用产联右派在执行局中的优势地位，竟于上月二十七日正式通过劳工组织不支持第三党议案。此举已激起国际码头与仓库工人工会等十一个进步地方工会的拒斥，甚至合众社亦承认：“如果左翼拒绝遵守决定，执行局也全然做不出什么事来”。目前产联内部反分裂的斗争正在展开中。\n    【新华社陕北五日电】各方讯：世界工人阶级及进步舆论，群起反对美帝国主义分裂世界职工联盟的阴谋活动。法国总工会一日为此发表特别公报，指出：二年多来，美国劳联反动领袖及其欧洲代理人布朗，一直在发动反对世职的强烈宣传，力图分裂参加世职的各工会。公报斥“法国分裂运动‘工人力量’的出现，是与国际反动分子反劳工阴谋有关的。”公报称：世职某些会员要求将马歇尔计划的讨论，列入即将举行的世职执委会会议的议程，这是对工人运动团结的新威胁。公报揭发马歇尔计划之拥护者所以要破坏工运之团结，乃是因为“工运团结是实现该计划途中的主要障碍。”公报提出警告：“分裂世职之企图最近正在增加，世职必须揭露其敌人的真面目”；公报痛斥石屋及其集团所采取的叛变工人阶级的反动立场，并坚决反对“世职讨论马歇尔计划。”波兰职工委员会一日通过决议，谴责美帝国主义走狗分裂世界职工运动之企图。决议称：“拥有二百八十万会员的波兰职工会中央委员会，坚决抗议将世职变为帝国主义的御用工具”，并号召“全世界职工会会员起来保卫世职的团结，象保卫自己的眼珠一样。”许多国家的职工会及民主人士，“对美英反动派破坏工人阶级努力奋斗所得来的职工运动的团结，表示异常愤怒。”（塔斯社）英民主舆论纷斥英国总工会中央委员会最近的叛卖行为。工人日报上月三十日指出：“总工会中央委员会决议将直接与马歇尔有关诸国的工会单独召开会议，以讨论马歇尔计划”之举，证明“总工会投靠了美国劳联右派诸领袖”。"

    "content": "That fake poor peasant leagues were established in Xi’jing is not unique to Wu’an. It also happened in Xisuzhuang in Shahe and in the triangle area of southern Shanxi in Taiyue. Recently, Wenxi’s local newspaper continuously published articles about poor peasant leagues leading the fight against superstition and conducting anti-espionage activities... It can be said that none of these poor peasant leagues truly served the poor peasants, hired peasants, and the broad masses of peasants.\n\nPoor peasant leagues must be established, and they must be established by mobilizing all the poor and hired peasants. Now, cadres from counties and districts everywhere are holding land conferences and rectifying the ranks. Why are some places so impatient? The reasons are nothing more than: First, some people are suffering from impatience. A comrade said, \"I'll secretly organize it first. When you announce its establishment, my poor peasant league will be at the forefront of everything. Watch me steal the show!\" Second, cadres protect each other, fearing that a real poor peasant league will target them. So they try to \"strike first to gain the upper hand,\" ostensibly for the poor and hired peasants, but actually to suppress them. Third, landlords and rich peasants take advantage of the poor and hired peasants, seize opportunities, transform themselves, sneak into the poor peasant league, and secretly seize power to sabotage the thorough division of land by the peasants. Which category does the fake poor peasant league in Xi’jing Village belong to? We hope Wu'an will investigate. Other places where poor peasant leagues have been established should also investigate.\n\nOur investigation and publication of the fake poor peasant league in Xi'an, Wu'an, is to provide a typical example for the entire region, to tell those comrades who are suffering from impatience, please calm down. Rushing ahead like this will not allow you to steal the show; it will only end in a \"disgraceful\" ending, because you are not working for the poor and hired peasants. Moreover, if you rush ahead, your work will inevitably be rough, and if it is rough, you will not be able to do things well. Even if your subjective wishes are not necessarily bad, the result will definitely be terrible. Cadres who want to protect each other and evade mass scrutiny should be honest. Knowing your mistakes and correcting them is the way out. If you make trouble now, the trick will soon be exposed, and the peasants will not agree with you. As for landlords and rich peasants, if you do not bow your heads and repent, wait for the land to be divided, and even plot a counterattack, then you are adding sin upon sin, and the people's court will judge you in the future. All those who are ambitious or have ulterior motives must be clear-headed. Organizing a fake poor peasant league is sabotaging the land law, is committing a crime. Using the masses is like playing with fire, and the fire will eventually burn you.\n\nWe hope that all the peasants in the region will unite and not be fooled. The poor peasant league is for the peasants to take charge themselves. Whoever wants to take over, manipulate, or exploit, we must boldly expose and resolutely oppose them. For our own benefit, for the thorough division of land, we will never fall into the trap of bad people and bad cadres.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对成立假贫农团\n\n1948-02-07\n第1版()\n专栏：短论\n\n    反对成立假贫农团\n    西井成立假贫雇团，这种事，不仅武安有，沙河西苏庄也有，太岳晋南三角地带也有。最近闻喜小报不断登载什么贫农团领导反迷信，有的地方搞反特务………可以这样说一句：这些贫农团恐怕没有一个真正给贫雇农及广大农民办事的。\n    贫农团一定要成立，那是由全体贫雇农发动起来去成立，现在各地县区干部都在开土地会议，整顿队伍，为什么有些地方就等不及了呢？原因不外：第一种是犯了急性病，有位同志说：“我先暗暗组织好，等到你一宣布成立，我的贫农团干什么都走在前头，看我出风头不？”第二种是干部互相包庇，怕成立了真正的贫农团整到自己头上，“先下手为强”，表面上是为了贫雇，实际上是打击贫雇。第三种是地主分子、富农分子利用贫雇，钻空子，摇身一变混到贫农团，暗地掌权破坏农民彻底平分。西井村假贫农团到底属于哪一类，希望武安加以检查，其他成立了贫农团的地方也应该检查。\n    我们调查和发表武安西井假贫农团，为的是向全区提供一个典型例子，告诉那些犯急性病的同志，请你们冷静一些，这样抢先不会出风头，结果只能落个“灰溜溜”的下场，因为你并不是为了给贫雇办事啊。而且你要抢先，作起来必然粗糙，粗糙了一定不会把事办好，尽管你主观愿望不一定坏，但是结果一定会很糟的。想相互包庇逃避群众审查的干部应该老实一些，知错改错才是出路，现在胡闹，不久西洋镜揭穿了，农民会不答应你的。至于地主分子、富农分子，如果你们不低头悔罪，等待平分，还要阴谋反攻，就叫做罪上加罪，人民法庭将来要审判你的。一切有野心的或是心怀叵测的人都要清醒，组织假贫农团就是破坏土地法，就是犯罪，利用群众就好比玩火，将来火会烧到你们身上的。\n    我们希望全区农民一致起来，不要上当，贫农团是要农民自己起来当家的，谁想包办、操纵、利用，咱们都要大胆揭发，坚决反对，为着自己的利益，为着彻底平分，咱们绝不上坏人坏干部的圈套。"

    "content": "Cadres Assign Fake Representatives\nUse the Name of Poor Peasant Leagues to File Lawsuits\n\n　　After Guo Wenzhang’s lawsuit reached the Border Region Government, the Nanxijing “Poor Peasant League” held two or three meetings about it. According to poor peasant Guo Jinzhu: “After Wang Wenyi was detained at the Border Region Government, Instructor Yuan from the village hospital came to ask me if Wang Wenyi was a poor peasant. I said he was. Then he told me to bring it up for discussion in the Poor Peasant League. When the Poor Peasant League meeting was held, I brought it up, but everyone remained silent. Shen Zhiming then said: ‘A preemptive strike doesn’t count!’ The meeting didn’t accomplish much. Shen Zhiming just started reading the newspaper.” Later, Anti-Resistance Director Wang Hu said to Director Gao: “Wenyi is our Farmers' Association director, we have to think of a way.” According to Gao Changfu: “We planned to send more than ten people to look for him,” Zhiming said: “No need, send one or two people is enough, go to the Border Region to inquire about where he is?” The people sent, afraid of being questioned, pretended to be going to Zhao Village to collect debts. According to them: “We inquired that he was in ×× village, but when we got to the edge of the village, we didn’t dare to go into the village to ask, so we returned.”\n\n　　When the Border Region Government called for the election of representatives to resolve the marriage dispute between the Guo and Wang families, according to Guo Jinzhu: “Shen Zhiming told Hu Tingxuan to have me, Wang Zhanquan, and Shen Youquan go. Later, at the village office, nothing was said, we were just told to take a list to the Border Region. I heard that this list was discussed and written by Wang Huaijie, Wang Hainiu, Wang Jufu, Wang Hu, Zhang Jiahhou, Hu Qicai, and seven or eight others. It was written and given to our representatives to take. The Poor Peasant League didn’t discuss it, and there was no election. We are illiterate, everyone said to say what was written on the list, each person remember one or two points, say as much as you can, and say whatever you are asked.”\n\n　　According to Wang Zhanquan (a member of the Farmers’ Association Standing Committee), a representative from Nanxijing: “That day, the Poor Peasant League meeting gathered forty or fifty people, and only then were the three of us called to go. Why were we called to go? I said: ‘What can I do with my mouth? What can I do with my literacy?’ Director Gao said: ‘It’s nothing, just go see Wang Wenyi, and say what’s wrong with what’s in the newspaper.’ I thought, everyone was assembled, and only then were the three of us called to go, isn’t this collusion among the cadres!?”\n\n　　From the activities of the fake Poor Peasant League, the reporter talked about the matter of assigning representatives, and Shen Zhiming couldn’t hide it. He had to admit that the representatives were assigned.\n\n　　On the 5th of this month, when the reporter asked Shen Zhiming about the above situation, and with the fact that the \"Poor Peasant League\" had a considerable number of cadres and upper-middle peasant components, he initially tried to shirk responsibility. Later, he admitted that the Nanxijing “Poor Peasant League” was no different from the old Farmers' Association and was not a true poor peasant organization. He said that the county and district leaders did not ask to organize a poor peasant league now, but that he and Bai Xiucheng, Li Guofang, Guo Wengui, and other district cadres had discussed it. They decided to find one or two genuine poor peasant activists in each base-point village to prevent sabotage of the land law. He also said: Village cadres often exploit peasants' fruits, peasants are generally afraid of cadres, and poor peasants are afraid to raise objections to cadres. He believed that only Gao Changfu and Wang Zhanquan were good, and he was determined to preserve them. He said to Wang Zhanquan: \"Work hard, and you will be promoted in the future.\" He also said to Gao Changfu: \"As long as you get close to the masses, your future is bright.\" (Shen Zhiming became a cadre because Gao Changfu mobilized him.) Therefore, Shen Zhiming regarded them as the backbone of the \"Poor Peasant League\" and appointed Gao Changfu as the leader. Finally, Shen Zhiming said: Because village cadres and activists, etc., had infiltrated the \"Poor Peasant League\", the \"Poor Peasant League\" simply could not exist.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 干部指派假代表  利用贫雇团名义打官司\n\n1948-02-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    干部指派假代表\n    利用贫雇团名义打官司\n    郭文章的官司打到边府以后，南西井“贫雇团”为这事开过两三次会。听贫雇郭金柱谈：“王文义押到边府后，驻村医院袁指导员来问我，王文义是不是贫雇？我说是贫雇。他就叫我在贫雇团提出来讨论讨论。开贫雇会的时候，我提出来，大家都不吭气。申志明就说：‘先凶不算凶！’这个会弄得没啥结果。申志明就念起报来了。”以后抗勤主任王胡找高主任说：“文义是咱们农会主任，也得想个法子。”另据高长富说：“我们准备派十多个人去找”，志明说：“不用，派一两个人去就可以了，去边区打听打听他在哪里？”派的人怕别人问，假装是去赵庄要帐的。根据他们说：“打听着在××村，走到村边，没敢进村打听，就返回来了。”\n    边府叫选代表去解决郭王两家婚姻问题，据郭金柱说：“申志明给胡廷选说，叫我和王占全、申有全三个人去，后来到村公所，也没说啥，叫带上一个单单上边区。听说这个单单是王怀节、王海牛、王聚富、王胡、张家后、胡起才等七八个人讨论好的，写好叫咱代表们拿上就去了。贫雇会没有讨论，也没选举，咱不识字，大家说照着单单上写的说，一个人记下一两条，能说多少就说多少，人家问啥就说啥。”\n    另据南西井代表王占全（是农会常委）说：“那一天贫雇团开会，四五十个人都集合齐啦，才叫俺们三个去的。俺一去，大家就叫俺三个去边府。为啥叫我去呢？我说：‘凭我的嘴呢？凭我识字呢？’高主任说：‘没有啥，去看看王文义，照着报上那点不对就说说’。我思想，人家都齐啦，才叫俺三个去，这不是干部内串了吧！？”\n    记者从假贫雇团的活动，谈到指派代表的事，申志明无法掩盖。只好承认：代表是指派的。\n    本月五日，当记者根据上述全部情况，并以“贫雇团”里有了相当多的干部和上中农成份去问申志明时，开头他还想推脱责任，后来承认：南西井“贫雇团”已经和旧农会没有两样了，不是真正贫雇组织。他说：县区领导上并没叫现在组织贫农团，只是他和白秀成、李国芳、郭文贵等几个区干讨论过。决定按基点每村找一两个真的贫雇积极分子，能防止破坏土地法就行。他还说：村干部多占农民果实，农民普遍怕干部，贫雇对干部有意见不敢提。认为只有高长富、王占全好，他决心要把他们保存下来。他对王占全说：“好好干，今后提拔你。”也对高长富说：“只要你好好接近群众，你的前途远大。”（申志明当干部，是高长富动员出来的）因此，申志明把他们当作“贫雇团”中坚分子，并指定高长富当领头。最后，申志明说：因为村干和积极分子等钻进了“贫雇团”，“贫雇团”根本没法存在下去了。"

Participants included representatives from various political parties, mass organizations, and local organizations of the Front. The congress adopted the Front's program drafted by the preparatory committee. During the discussion, speakers unanimously called on the Italian people to strengthen unity and fight for democracy and against the reactionaries and remnants of Fascism. Roussou, leader of the Sardinian branch of the Action Party, declared: \"All true democrats are honored to cooperate with the Communist Party, which is a constructive force in every modern democratic country.\" General Yazzi, a former Republican Party member, stated that after breaking away from the Republican Party, which colluded with Gasperi, he and his supporters in the Republican Party established the People's Republican Party and joined the People's Democratic Front. Maddalena, chairwoman of the Italian Women's League, called on all Italian democratic groups to participate in the peace conference to be held in Rome on March 14th. Representatives of other democratic groups expressed their enthusiastic support for the People's Democratic Front at the meeting. Professor Secolo, a member of the congress preparatory committee, emphasized in his closing remarks that the people's democratic movement is expanding throughout Italy with unprecedented force. He pointed out that the working people, led by democratic parties, have frustrated the Gasperi reactionary regime's efforts to restore Fascist rule in Italy. Secolo concluded by stating that the establishment of the People's Democratic Front is to give the people the freedom to decide their own destiny and manage their country. The congress decided to hold mass rallies and demonstrations of the People's Democratic Front throughout Italy on February 8th, and elected the presidium and executive committee. The presidium includes Secolo (non-partisan), Togliatti (Italian Communist Party), Nenni (Socialist Party), Vittorio (General Confederation of Labor), Moro (Labor Democratic Party), and several representatives from other political parties and organizations. The executive committee includes six members from the Italian Communist Party, six from the Socialist Party, and many representatives from other democratic political parties and organizations. The National Council of the People's Democratic Front, consisting of 70 to 80 people, will also be established soon.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Dragging people in and pulling them out, the composition of the \"Poor Peasant League\" became not entirely poor peasants. Cadres came in, and upper-middle peasants also came in. The leader of the \"Poor Peasant League,\" Gao Changfu, was the vice director of the Farmers' Association and also a branch committee member. There were also five people including Wang Huaizhi, the deputy director of civil education, Wang Zhanquan and Wang Yuchun, standing committee members of the Farmers' Association, and Wang Wenxiu, the street chief. According to Wang Gongliang, Wang Zhengqing, and Wang Cun, Liu Yuchun is an upper-middle peasant. His family has six people, with four full laborers, now cultivating fourteen mu of land (including five mu of good land), with a total output of fourteen dan. He also has a donkey and four or five sheep, and a compound. (The village's per capita average is less than half a mu of good land, and the average output per person is about two dan.) They also said that Wang Xueyou and Wang Huaizhi are all upper-middle peasant households. However, some people with good class backgrounds were left out of the \"Poor Peasant League.\" For example, poor peasant Wang Congyi, according to Guo Jinzhu: \"I heard that he used to be superstitious, didn't eat onions and garlic, and he has seventy or eighty small walnut trees that he cultivates himself. Everyone wanted to divide them equally, but he couldn't accept the idea, so he wasn't allowed to join.\" Wang Zongtang and Wang Jiutang, who have been herding cattle and sheep for three generations and are still herding cattle and sheep for the Farmers' Association and the village, have not yet joined the \"Poor Peasant League.\"\n\nAfter the \"Poor Peasant League\" was established, the first major event was to struggle against poor peasant Wang Zhengqing (nicknamed Lao Wudan). Wang Zhengqing was a shop assistant in a mutton soup shop run by the militia. A shepherd working for the soup shop picked up a sheep lost by the village hospital and asked him to slaughter it for thirteen and a half jin of meat, which the soup shop sold. When the hospital heard that Wang Zhengqing had slaughtered the sheep, it asked the \"Poor Peasant League\" to handle it. The \"Poor Peasant League\" brought Wang Zhengqing to a meeting and struggled against him. They brought up three mistakes: 1. Historical corruption; 2. Speculation; 3. Sabotaging the relationship between the army and the people, and asked him to confess. According to Wang Hainiu, an activist in the \"Poor Peasant League\": Wang Zhengqing is too bad, even though his class background is good. The honest peasants didn't know how to solve the problem. Director Gao said: \"I've held many meetings, let me say a few words. It's not about compensating for the things, it's mainly about fixing your thoughts.\" The first day of the meeting, Wang Zhengqing was cried, but the problem was not solved. The next day, he admitted that he planned to take a sheep home. Everyone decided to ask him to compensate the hospital with a sheep worth twenty jin of meat, plus \"support\" the purchase of ten to fifteen jin of mutton, which he accepted one by one. He said: \"I want to follow the mass line. Everyone agrees with my opinion. If I commit another offense in the future, confine me for a month.\" When he talked to the reporter about this matter, he said with his mouth: \"I'm not convinced, I'm not convinced,\" but tears kept falling from his eyes.\n\nSome peasants who had stood up, even though they had not been directly hit by the \"Poor Peasant League,\" were still uneasy and constantly afraid. Wang Qi, who participated in the \"Poor Peasant League,\" said: \"People say I am a lower-middle peasant, and also an honest peasant. The village averages two dan of grain per mu, but my land is not good, and the yield is high. My family of four only produces about seven dan. I am sixty-three years old, and people asked me to participate in the Poor Peasant League twice, and then never asked me again. My thinking... Cough, cough! I guess I have become a rich peasant?! I went to the Poor Peasant League to ask, and Yang Hai said: 'If we ask you to come, you come; if we don't ask you to come, you don't have to come.' I don't know what's going on! The Poor Peasant League distributed some clothes once (sent by the district), wrote my name on them, but didn't give them to me. Could it be that I have some kind of problem!\"\n\nOrganizing poor peasant production and stopping waste was one of the purposes of establishing the \"Poor Peasant League.\" It was done, but it was too wrong. They took 260,000 yuan of fruit money from the Farmers' Association to sell pork. The idea was to earn dividends for the poor peasants and get some meat to eat. Wang @ Lin and two others were selected to do this. However, they didn't understand this business, so they found a landlord named Hu Tingliang and paid him 400 yuan a day. They bought 580 jin of pork from other villages at once. The business was not very good, and 90 jin were left unsold. After calculating the accounts, including shrinkage and expenses, there was still a shortage of 34,000 yuan. After discussing it, they thought that selling these 90 jin at 385 yuan per jin could recover the money. So they said to divide it up and let the poor peasants eat it. Director Gao said: \"Even though it's cheap, you can't buy too much.\" But what did the poor peasant Guo Jinzhu say? He said: \"The Poor Peasant League got meat (the meat was not good, the political director Hu Tingxuan said: 'Mostly legs'), but couldn't sell it, so they asked me to pay 400 yuan per jin. I can't afford that. I can't even bear to buy vermicelli.\" The meat couldn't be sold in the village, so they had to go to Beixijing to sell it, and I don't know if it was all sold.\n\nVice Village Chief Hao Guitian calculated the account of waste during this year's Lunar New Year: the \"Poor Peasant League\" bought 580 jin of meat for the village, plus what the mutual aid group had bought, totaling more than 1,000 jin, at least 500 jin more than in previous years. Each person ate at least two jin more of white flour (like the well-to-do middle peasant Zhang Jiajun, who pushed one dou of wheat in previous years, and one and a half dou this year), wasting 2,000 jin in the whole village, plus other waste (like middle peasant Hu Qicai, who bought ten jin of vermicelli in previous years, and twenty-three jin this year), totaling 1 million yuan. The village wasted so much, but the \"Poor Peasant League\" did not stop it, but added fuel to the fire. Until now, other villages are still constantly selling meat to Nanxijing. On the 5th, police officer Guo Qinglin even sold three jin and two liang.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 旧干部领导假贫雇团不干正事\n\n1948-02-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    旧干部领导假贫雇团不干正事\n    拉来拉去，“贫雇团”的成份就不完全是贫雇了，干部进来了，上中农也进来了。“贫雇团”的领导人高长富就是农会副主任，又是支部委员。还有民教副主任王怀节，农会常委王占全、王玉春、街长王文修等五人。据王功亮、王正清、王存三个人反映：刘玉春是上中农，他家六口人，合四个全劳力，现种十四亩地（其中有五亩好地），共合十四大石产量。还有一个驴、四五只羊，一串院。（全村按人口平均，每人还均不到半亩好地，每人平均产量两石左右。）他三个人还说，王学有、王怀节等都是上中农户。可是有好些成份好的，却被丢在“贫雇团”外面。比方贫农王从义，据郭金柱说：“听说他过去迷信，不吃葱蒜，他有自己作务的七八十棵小核桃树，大家要均均，他思想想不通，不叫他入。”三辈子放牛放羊，现在还给农会、村里放牛放羊的王宗堂、王久堂也还没有参加“贫雇团”。\n    “贫雇团”成立以后，头一桩大事是斗争贫农王正清（外号老五旦）。王正清在民兵羊汤铺当伙计，羊汤铺羊工拾了驻村医院丢的一只羊，叫他杀了十三斤半肉，羊汤铺卖了。医院听说羊是王正清杀了，叫“贫雇团”处理，“贫雇团”就把王正清弄到会上斗了一顿。提出他三个错误：一、历史腐化；二、投机取巧；三、破坏军民关系，叫他坦白。据“贫雇团”积极分子王海牛说：王正清这家伙太坏，就是成份好。老实农民不知道怎么解决才好。高主任说：“我开的会多，我来说说。倒不是说赔东西，主要是搞你的思想。”头天开会，斗哭了王正清，也没解决。第二天他承认自己打算弄一个羊回家。大家就决定叫他赔医院二十斤肉的一只羊，另外“拥护”羊肉十斤到十五斤，他一一接受。他说：“我要走群众路线儿，大家意见都同意，以后再犯了，禁闭我一个月。”他向记者谈起这桩事，嘴上说：“不屈，不屈”，眼里却一直掉泪。\n    有的翻身户虽没受过“贫雇团”直接打击，也弄得神魂不安，老是害怕。参加“贫雇团”的王起说：“人家说我是下中农，也是老实农民。村上平均两石产粮，我的地不好，产量又高，我家四口人，就七石来产量。我六十三了，人家叫我参加了两次贫雇会，就再不叫我了。我思想……咳咳！我大概成了富农了？！找到贫雇会去问，杨孩说：‘这事，叫你来你就来，不叫你来你就不用来。’也不知道是怎会事！贫雇团分了一回衣裳（区里发的），写上咱的名又不给咱。咱该不是有个圪塔哩！”\n    组织贫雇生产，制止浪费，是“贫雇团”成立的一个目的。做也做了，就是太不对头。他们拿上农会的二十六万果实款，去贩卖猪肉。说的是给贫雇赚红利，弄点肉吃吃。就选了王＠林等二人办这个事。可是他俩不懂这一行，又觅了个地主，叫胡廷亮，一天给他四百块钱的工钱。到外村一下子买回五百八十斤猪肉。买卖不算很好，剩下九十斤没人要了。一算帐，连折秤加花消，还短三万四千块钱不够本。合计了一下，这九十斤按三百八十五块一斤卖出去，能捞回来钱。就说分一分，叫贫农大家都吃吃。高主任说：“看是便宜，想多买也不行。”可是贫农郭金柱怎么说呢？他说：“贫雇团弄了肉（肉不好，政治主任胡廷选说：‘净些腿腿’），卖不了，叫我掏四百块钱一斤，我吃不起那，我连粉条还舍不得秤哩。”本村卖不出去，只好到北西井去卖，也不知道卖光了没有。\n    今年过阴历年的浪费帐，副村长郝贵田算了一下：“贫雇团”往村里买了五百八十斤肉，加上互助组贩来的，够一千多斤，比往年至少浪费五百斤。每人至少多吃二斤白面（象富裕中农张家俊，往年推一斗麦子，今年推一斗五升），全村浪费两千斤，加上旁的浪费（象中农胡起才，往年称十来斤粉条儿，今年称了二十三斤），就够一百万元。村里浪费的这么厉害，“贫雇团”没制止，倒是火上泼了瓢油。直到现在，外村还不断朝南西井卖肉，五日那天，公安员郭清林还卖了三斤二两。"

    "content": "Certain Cadres Attempt to Seize Leadership Through Equal Distribution\n    Xijing Organizes Fake Poor Peasant Leagues\n    Struggles Against Poor Peasants Foster Waste and Undermine the Land Law\n\n    [This newspaper's news] This newspaper's joint reporter group with Xin Dazhong, after a seven-day investigation (January 30th to February 5th), discovered that the \"Poor Peasant League\" in Nanxijing, Sixth District of Wu'an, was an organization manipulated by certain district and village cadres attempting to seize the leadership of the poor peasants in the land redistribution movement.\n\n    After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the district convened some cadres and masses from various villages to a meeting to explain the Land Law Outline, but there was no instruction to immediately organize poor peasant leagues. Unexpectedly, the district public security cadre Shen Zhiming (a native of Nanxijing, who served as the village chief for several years and is now leading the work at this key point), on the way back to Nanxijing from the district, said to Gao Changfu, the deputy director of the village peasant association: \"I'll just tell you, we must organize a poor peasant league, and you can be the head of the poor peasant league.\" Even before the district explained the Land Law, Shen Zhiming had said in the Nanxijing peasant association: It is necessary to implement the poor peasant line and draw a clear class boundary. He said: \"Who are the poor peasants? Gao Changfu is, both poor and a farmhand; Who are the landlords? Hu Tingxuan (political director) is a bankrupt landlord.\" He said to Gao Changfu: \"Once the land redistribution movement comes, many old cadres will fall. The old ones are gone, and the new ones cannot rise; only you and Wang Zhanquan are capable.\" According to him, his intention was to \"preserve\" the two cadres, Gao Changfu and Wang Zhanquan. Therefore, upon returning to the village from the district, he actively carried out the activities of organizing the poor peasant league. According to Gao Changfu: \"Zhiming said that our poor peasants will rise to be the masters of the house in the future, and the cadres cannot be the masters of the house. We must be prepared, and as soon as official business comes, we will arrange it.\" Sure enough, at the beginning of the twelfth lunar month, the \"Poor Peasant League\" of Nanxijing was announced.\n\n    What conditions are required to participate in the poor peasant league? Gao Changfu said: Those who protect landlords are not allowed, hooligans are not allowed, selfish people are not allowed, and those who leak information are not allowed, only honest peasants are allowed. Shen Zhiming also added one more point - peasants who are landless or have little land. Labor hero Wang Gongliang said: \"The original discussion was that all newly turned-over households should be included.\"\n\n    Upon returning from the district, a meeting of peasant association group leaders was convened to mobilize everyone to find poor peasants in each group, and one hundred and eight were found at once. Gao Changfu said: \"I thought this wouldn't work, there are leaks. I only secretly registered ten, and when I told Zhiming, he said: No (he thought the number was too small), so I called a meeting.\" Poor peasant Wang Hainiu told reporters: \"Director Gao said at the meeting: 'We are not good enough! Too few, what should we do? Let's each find another one!' I said: 'If we expand like this, we won't be able to find enough even by the second or third month of the new year, let's each find another one.'\" (That is to say, one person finds two). According to Gao Changfu, Zhiming planned to find one hundred to eighty, and I planned that the poor peasants could find sixty or so, plus twenty or thirty middle peasants, which would be enough.\n\n    When it grew to twenty-five people, it was divided into three groups, and Liu Erheng, Wang [@] Lin, and Wang Shuanglai were selected as group leaders. Wang Hainiu said that these were selected as three \"calling group leaders\" - only in charge of calling people to meetings.\n\n    In this way, finding and finding, in less than twenty days, it expanded to more than fifty poor peasants. Why did it develop so quickly? Wang Zhanquan, a member of the peasant association standing committee, said: \"The method of development is pulling, you pull me, I pull you, for example, if the brother comes in, he will definitely pull the younger brother in, and everyone is embarrassed, so they approve it.\" Because these people were pulled in, many honest peasants, although they went in, still didn't know what to do. Poor peasant Hu Wude said: \"It's fair to divide the land to others, I don't know what it's for.\" Wang Qiude (who was a long-term worker at the time of Wang Yirong's grandfather, the current district chief of the Ninth District of Wu'an) is still doing odd jobs now. He said: \"I heard that the poor peasant league is called land redistribution! When will the meeting be held, I will go if they call me, and I won't go if they don't, I don't touch the inside.\" Even Wang Hainiu, the most active member of the \"Poor Peasant League\", did not know what the \"Poor Peasant League\" was for. Asked him why the poor peasants are called masters of the house? He said: \"This has not been said yet!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 某些干部企图在平分中夺取领导权  西井组织假贫雇团  斗争贫农助长浪费破坏土地法\n\n1948-02-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    某些干部企图在平分中夺取领导权\n    西井组织假贫雇团\n    斗争贫农助长浪费破坏土地法\n    【本报消息】本报、新大众联合记者团，经过七天（一月三十号至二月五号）调查，发现武安六区南西井“贫雇团”，是被某些区、村干部操纵，企图在平分土地运动中夺取贫雇领导权的组织。\n    土地法大纲公布以后，区上召集各村一部分干部、群众开会，解释土地法大纲，根本没有叫马上组织贫农团。想不到区公安干事申志明（南西井人，当过这村好几年村长，现在领导这个基点的工作）在从区里回南西井的路上，和这村副农会主任高长富说：“我只跟你讲，咱要组织贫雇团，你就能当贫雇团的头儿”。还在区上解释土地法以前，申志明就在南西井农会里说过：要贯彻贫雇路线，划清阶级界限。他说：“谁是贫雇？高长富就是，又贫又雇；谁是地主？胡廷选（政治主任）就是破落地主”。他对高长富说过：“平分土地运动一来，旧干部好多都要垮台。旧的下去了，新的起不来；只有你和王占全能干”。据他说：他的心思是为的“保存”高长富和王占全两个干部。所以，从区上回到村里，就积极进行组织贫雇团的活动。据高长富说：“志明说过，以后咱们贫雇要起来当家，干部不能当家了。我们要准备好，公事一来，咱们就布置好了。”果然，阴历腊月初，南西井的“贫雇团”宣布成立了。\n    够什么条件才能参加贫雇团呢？高长富说：包庇地主不要，流氓不要，自私自利不要，透气分子也不要，要老实农民。申志明还补充了一条——要无地少地的农民。劳动英雄王功亮说：“原来讨论的是新翻身户都要。”\n    从区上回来，就召集了个农会小组长会，发动大家在各组找贫雇，一下子找了一百零八个。高长富说：“我想到这样不行，有透气分子。我就只暗暗的登记了十个，给志明一说，他说：不着（嫌人太少），我就开了个会。”贫雇王海牛对记者说：“高主任在会上说过：‘咱这些人不行呀！太少，怎办？咱一个人再找一个吧！’我说：‘象这样扩充，到过年二、三月也找不起来，咱再一人找一个。’”（就是说一个人找两个）据高长富说：志明计划找一百至八十个，我计划贫雇能找六十来个，再配二三十个中农，就差不多够了。\n    发展到二十五个人的时候，就划分了三个小组，选了刘二恒、王＠林、王双来三人当组长。王海牛说这是选了三个“叫人组长”——光管叫人开会。\n    这样找来找去，不到二十天，就扩充到五十多个贫雇了。为什么发展的这样快？农会常委王占全说：“发展方法是拉的，你拉我，我拉你，比方哥哥进来了，一定把弟弟拉进来，大家也不好意思，就批准了。”因为这些人是拉进来的，所以许多老实农民虽然进去了，还不知道干什么。贫农胡五的就说：“把地给人家分公道就算，咱也不知道到底干什么。”王秋的（是现任武安九区区长王玉荣爷爷时的长工）现在还打短工，他说：“我听说贫雇团叫平分土地哩！啥时开会，叫去我就去，不叫就不去，咱也不摸里边的事。”连“贫雇团”最积极的王海牛，也不知道“贫雇团”是干啥的。问他为什么叫贫雇当家？他说：“这个还没有讲哩！”"

    "content": "The newspaper serves land reform\n    Some provinces publish newspapers specifically about land reform. The \"Land Reform Bulletin\" of Leszno is particularly well edited. Technical guidance, political encouragement, and farmer correspondence are mixed and arranged. It explains \"how to divide the land\" in simple language. Farmers should start with the county representatives and organize their own committees, \"seven to eleven people, honest and knowledgeable about the land... democratically elected and responsible for reporting to the whole village.\"\n\n    \"Instructions to the Committee\" are equally clear and concise. They must register the property of the estates and prevent looting. Surveying the land must be done by surveyors; if there are no surveyors, let farmers familiar with this work do it. Boundary demarcation must be accurate and fair, but should take into account the convenience of farming and the orientation of roads. If an applicant's son has not yet joined the army, he should be sent to the nearest recruitment location. \"Whoever is unwilling to fight for the land of Poland has no right to the land.\" The instructions conclude: \"When the whole village believes that the distribution is fair, the division should be implemented immediately.\"\n\n    This newspaper is already advocating a new concept of property. Yesterday, land and livestock belonged to the landlords; today, if a landlord secretly gives a chicken to his friend, he is a thief, and the newspaper will announce his theft. \"Landlords are harming the property of the peasants! The police must investigate! The female owner of Szulczynski Manor has given livestock to her relatives... The landlord of Gumminsy Manor is driving livestock out... The female landlord of Zalisy has taken away thirteen cows... Farmers! Can't you get those livestock back?\"...\n\nLand Reform Promotes the War Towards Victory\n\n    Why launch such a complex land reform during the war?\n\n    These years when the war is approaching victory are the easiest time to carry out reforms. The absence of many large landlords (because some were killed by the German invaders and some fled with the German invaders) created an economic gap that must be quickly filled by new owners to cultivate the land. ...\n\n    In addition, land reform has its significant military and political reasons. The large estates of the landlords are often centers of reactionary politics. Under the new regime, they become dens of terrorist gangs, assassinating civil and military officials. Conversely, the farmers who have become new landowners are the pillars of the new regime and a natural source of soldiers for the new Polish army.\n\n    Land reform is awakening the Polish countryside; it has launched strong popular support for the new regime and a surge of voluntary enlistment. It enables millions of farmers to understand concretely, according to statistics, their reasons for demanding East Prussia and Pomerania (places in the past where Germany invaded and occupied Poland, East Prussia in northern Poland, Pomerania in western Poland, now all belonging to Poland - Editor). Therefore, although land reform is so complex, it has not distracted from the war effort. It is creating a new force for the march on Berlin! (Later, along with the Soviet Red Army hitting Berlin, there were Polish troops. - Editor)\n\nCelebration of Land Returning Home\n\n    In every county, people hang flags, play music, and sing the national anthem, holding grand celebrations. Polish soldiers salute whenever the government awards land deeds to farmers. I, along with Vice Minister of Agriculture Bieniek, attended the celebration in the town of Raciąż, which is just one of the celebrations commonly held in various towns.\n\n    We walked through the market to the auditorium in the park. The crowd was flowing in like water. The auditorium is a rectangular, ordinary building, built a long time ago, with no decorations. Two young Polish soldiers, armed, stood on either side of the door, like two pillars. When Bieniek approached, they stood at attention and saluted. At this time, it seemed that someone had given a signal, because as we entered the door, the band in the auditorium began to play the national anthem to welcome us.\n\n    Then, the dense crowd suddenly and magically separated to both sides, leaving a passage straight to the stage—facing the red and white Polish flag and the dark green Christmas tree on the stage. Bieniek, like Santa Claus, was about to award deeds to farmers for 30,000 acres of land to those in attendance.\n\n    The county land commissioner began reporting statistics on land reform. Nearly five thousand households in Raciąż County received land. There were two thousand one hundred and sixty-two former farm laborers and landless peasants, each receiving an average of nine acres. There were two thousand six hundred and eighty-five farm families who previously had less than five acres of land, each receiving an average of four acres. A natural cheer erupted from the venue, and everyone clearly knew the land they deserved.\n\n    Then, everyone sat down and listened quietly to the report that should be given at such a gathering. ...\n\nUncovering a Slab of Stone from a Thousand Years Ago\n\n    Bieniek reported on the thousand-year struggle of Polish farmers, and the eyes of the masses were focused on him. He said that the land struggle was part of their long-term struggle for an independent and strong Poland. The landlords were constantly selling out their national interests for their own feudal privileges; this is the lesson of history. ...\n\n    The speaker concluded: \"Farmers have been waiting for generations for this day when the Polish land is distributed by their own farmers' committees. What you have received is not just land, but the foundation of an independent and strong Poland. Kościuszko said: 'Only free farmers can build a strong and free country.' Today we have laid the foundation for the freedom of our country.\"\n\n    The rough faces of the farmers under sheepskin hats and thick scarves looked particularly tense at this time. They listened to Bieniek's report, listening to the history of Polish farmers from the Piast dynasty to modern times, and did not feel the sub-zero cold. They were nodding seriously, affirming their destiny, the nine acres of land they received today made them a part of history.\n\n    After a while, a burst of cheers suddenly shook the venue. A young military officer walked to the stage, wearing a military uniform with a \"Polish Eagle\" badge on his hat.\n\n    \"Someone told you that taking land is dangerous,\" he said directly: \"They said that the London Poles (the Polish reactionary government was in exile in London at that time - Editor) will come and take the land away and punish you. But you now have an army, and I can tell you that it is a new army. The old army was led by the sons of landlords and gentry as officials, and they used it to suppress the peasant movement. Our new army loves farmers and protects the interests of farmers. In this new army, the sons of farmers can be promoted to officers.\"\n\n    \"The land deed you received today is guaranteed by the bayonets of our new democratic Polish army.\"\n\n    His speech caused a sensation in the entire venue.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 波兰的土地改革（续完）\n斯特朗\n1948-02-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    波兰的土地改革（续完）\n    斯特朗作\n    李棣华译\n    报纸为土地改革服务\n    有的省份出版专门关于土地改革的报纸。莱苏的“土地改革公报”编辑得特别好。技术指导，政治鼓励，和农民通讯掺和起来编排着。用简单的文字解释“怎样分田”。农民们应该先同县代表一块作起，组织自己的委员会，“七人至十一人，忠实而且了解土地情况……民主选出，负责对全村汇报。”\n    “对于委员会的指示”也是同样的简单明了。他们必须登记田庄的财产，防止掠夺。丈量土地一定要让测量员作；如果没有测量员的话，就让熟习这种工作的农民去作。划界必须准确公道，但要照顾到农作的便利和道路的方位。申请人的儿子如果还没有参军的话，应该送他们到最靠近的征募新兵地点。“谁不愿意为波兰的土地而斗争，谁就对土地没有权利。”指示结束说：“当全村认为分配已经公道的时候，应该立刻实行划分。”\n    这个报纸已经在倡导着一种新的财产观念。昨天，土地和牲畜是属于地主的；今天，如果地主鬼带一只鸡给他的朋友的话，他就是贼，报纸就要宣布他的盗窃行为。“地主们正在断害农民的财产呢！警察必须查究！斯劳赛尼的女庄主把牲口给了她的亲戚了……古明斯基的地主在往外赶牲畜……扎利苏的女地主已经牵出去十三头牛了……农民们！你们不能把那些牲畜找回来么？”………\n    土地改革推进战争走向胜利\n    为什么在战争当中发动这样复杂的土地改革呢？\n    这个战争接近胜利的年月，正是进行改革最容易的时候。许多大地主的缺席（这是因为有的被德寇杀了，有的跟德寇一块逃跑了），造成了一个经济上的空隙，必须很快找到新主来耕种土地。……\n    此外，土地改革有它重大的军事和政治理由的。地主们的大田庄经常是反动政治的中心。在新政权的下面，它们便成为恐怖分子帮会的巢穴，暗杀文武官员。相反的，新作了土地主人的农民们却是新政权的支柱，也是新波兰军的自然兵源。\n    土地改革正在唤醒着波兰乡村；它发动了人民对于新政权的大力支持和自愿参军热潮。它使得千百万农民，根据统计数字，具体了解到他们要求东普鲁士和波美拉尼亚（是过去德国侵占波兰的地方，东普鲁士在波兰北部，波美拉尼亚在波兰西部，现在都已归波兰所有了。——编者）的理由。所以，土地改革虽然那样的复杂，却并没有分散了作战努力。它是正在创造向柏林大进军的新生力量呢！（后来，随着苏联红军打到柏林的，正有着波兰人的军队。——编者）\n    庆祝土地还家的大会\n    在每个县里，人民悬着旗，奏着乐，唱着国歌，在开隆重的庆祝大会。波兰的士兵们，每当政权把地契授给农民的时候，便行礼致敬。我跟农业部副部长毕涅克参加了拉左县城的庆祝大会，这不过是各城镇所普遍举行的大会之一罢了。\n    我们步行过市场，到达了公园里的会堂。群众正在象水流一般往里走。会堂是个长方形的平常建筑，很久以前修造的，没有什么装饰。两个年青的波兰兵，带着武器，站在门的两边，好象两根柱石似的。当毕涅克走近的时候，他们便立正敬礼。这时，好象有人发出了信号，因为正当我们进门的时候，会堂里的乐队便奏起国歌来欢迎我们。\n    接着，密集的人群忽然很神奇地向两旁分开，中间空出一条直达主席台的行道——正对着台上的红白波兰国旗和深绿的圣诞树。毕涅克，好象圣诞老人一样，正要授给到会农民三万英亩土地的地契。\n    县土地特派员开始报告土地改革的统计数字。在拉左县将近五千户人家得到土地。有二千一百六十二户是以往的雇农和无地的农民，每户平均得到九英亩。有二千六百八十五户是以往只有不到五英亩地的农家，每户平均得到四英亩。会场发出了自然的欢呼，每人都清楚应得的土地。\n    于是，大家便安坐下来，静听在这样集会里应有的报告。………\n    揭掉了千年以来的石板\n    毕涅克报告千年以来的波兰农民斗争，群众的目光都集中到他身上。他说，土地斗争是他们为了独立强盛的波兰的长期斗争的一部分。地主们为了他们本身的封建特权，无时不在出卖他们的国家利益；这就是历史教训。………\n    讲演的人作出这样的结论：“农民们辈辈等待着这个由农民自己的委员会分配波兰土地的日子。你们所得到的并不仅仅是土地，而是波兰独立强盛的基础。高苏斯哥说过：‘只有自由的农民才能建立强盛自由的国家。’我们今天已经打下了我们国家自由的基础了。”\n    在羊皮帽子和大毛围巾底下的粗实的农民的脸，这时显得分外紧张。他们听着毕涅克的报告，听着从比埃斯特王朝一直到现代的波兰农民的历史，决没有感到零下的严寒。他们很严肃地在点头，肯定了他们的命运，他们今天所得到的九英亩土地使他们成了历史的一部分。\n    停了一会儿，一阵欢呼声，忽然在会场震荡起来。一个青年军官走到台前，穿着军服，头上有个“波兰之鹰”的帽徽。\n    “有人告诉你们说拿土地很危险，”他直接了当地说：“他们说，伦敦波兰人（波兰反动政府当时流亡在伦敦——编者）会来拿走土地，惩罚你们的。但是，你们现在有了一支军队了，而且，我可以对你们说，这是一支新军。旧军是地主士绅的子弟们当官带领，被他们用来镇压农民运动的。我们的新军爱护农民，保护农民利益。在这支新军当中，农民子弟是能升作军官的。”\n    “今天你们所得到的地契，是被我们的新民主波兰军的刺刀所保证的。”\n    他的演说轰动了全场。"

    "content": "On the Principle-Mindedness of Bolsheviks\n    By Lan Lieboju\n    Translated by Ya Tianer\n    Lenin and Stalin taught us that a principled policy is the only correct policy, and our party cannot tolerate the slightest wavering or unprincipled behavior. It requires our staff to consistently complete their tasks without compromise and to always stand in the position of political activists.\n\n    Bolshevik principle-mindedness is the spirit of irreconcilability towards any tendency that deviates even slightly from the party's principles, ideology, and policies. The party's policies are the source of life for the Soviet system. Party workers should use the party's policies as a guide to action in all their work, whether big or small, and proceed from a politically principled line.\n\n    Lenin taught us that politics starts from matters related to the interests of millions of people; it is to treat problems politically in a principled way. That is, to observe problems from the perspective of millions of people and their interrelationships. This cannot allow for the slightest compromise in the face of local, parochial, or friendly relationships. Bolsheviks value friendship and comradeship. However, they believe that the highest standard for evaluating a person's behavior is to see how that person treats the interests of the people, as represented by the Soviet state.\n\n    Lenin wrote: \"We recognize the obligations between comrades, the obligation to help all comrades, the obligation to listen patiently to the opinions of comrades; but for us, the obligations between comrades arise from the obligations to Russia and the world social democracy, and cannot be reversed.\" (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 2, pp. 541-542)\n\n    From this, it can be seen that educating cadres in the spirit of principle-mindedness means that cadres must not proceed from personal or local interests when deciding any issue, but from the interests of the state. Uphold these interests in all circumstances and fight against anti-state tendencies. The Bolshevik principle-mindedness of each staff member is reflected in their attitude towards the work they undertake, and their principle-mindedness is checked by whether they subordinate their work to the major political tasks of the state and locality. The standard for evaluating all measures is: do these measures consolidate or weaken our great cause; do they promote the continued development of this great cause, or do they hinder its development? This should also be used as a standard for measuring the Bolshevik principle-mindedness of all staff members.\n\n    Reality is proving that the inability to correctly judge various phenomena and the inability to treat problems in a principled way will result in serious losses. Take the mistakes made by the editorial departments of the two magazines \"Star\" and \"Leningrad\" as an example—these mistakes were exposed by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in a timely manner. What was the essence of these magazines' mistakes? It lies in the fact that the leading staff of the two magazines \"Star\" and \"Leningrad\" did not base their relationship with literary workers on the interests of correctly educating the Soviet people and politically guiding the activities of literary workers; instead, they based their relationship with literary workers on personal and friendly—that is, vulgar—interests. Because they were unwilling to break their friendships, they did not criticize worthless, anti-artistic, and politically detached works; because they were afraid of offending friends, they published very inappropriate works. The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stated: \"This kind of liberalism sacrifices the interests of the people and the state, the interests of correctly educating our youth, to friendly relationships; it blocks criticism, and as a result, writers stop continuing to improve themselves and lose their sense of responsibility to the people, the state, and the party. They also stop moving forward!\" Or let us take a look at the facts of flattery towards foreigners. It is clear that some of our backward intellectuals have still not gotten rid of this shameful problem. Some party and economic leaders do not educate people in the spirit of Soviet national pride, but instead compromise with the facts of obsequiousness and servility towards foreigners. Is this not a manifestation of unprincipled behavior? This shows that it is necessary to demonstrate principle-mindedness in all matters, and that a politically-minded attitude in party work—is the basic attitude in party work. Comrade Stalin taught us that: \"The foundation of the life and work of the party does not lie in the organizational forms that the party has adopted or can adopt at that time, but in the party's policies and its domestic and foreign policies.\" (Lenin and Stalin on Party Building, Vol. 2, p. 419). This means that our staff members should not only be good organizers and skilled practical workers, but also politically mature and ideologically firm people.\n\n    Profound thought and a firm belief in the correctness of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism are the foundation of Bolshevik principle-mindedness. Only those who are firm in principle and have a good grasp of Marxist-Leninist thought can have the fighting Bolshevik principle-mindedness and treat problems from the principled standpoint of the party.\n\n    Marxist-Leninist theory gives cadres a bright future and gives them confidence in their work. This theory develops their talents, enabling them to see the big picture from small things; to feel that they are fighting for a great ideal in their daily and immediate work; conversely, an attitude of indifference to theory will make them lose their future. Regarding those who are indifferent to theory, Comrade Stalin said that they have changed from political activists to political philistines, to unprincipled and apolitical pragmatists.\n\n    Comrade Stalin said: \"Regarding these vacillating people, the great Russian writer Gogol once said quite pertinently: 'Those who have no fixed ideas are neither this nor that, anyway you can't understand what kind of people they are, they are simply neither fish nor fowl.'\" (Lenin, Stalin on Party Building, Vol. 2, p. 690).\n\n    Mastering Marxist-Leninist theory is the method of educating our cadres ideologically and in principle, and it is also the most important method of improving their combat effectiveness. The great ideas of Marxism-Leninism are the living source of the spiritual strength of our cadres, the living source of the determination of cadres and their inexhaustible energy in overcoming difficulties. Practical experience proves that people who are ideologically developed are also powerful in practice, they have greater confidence in their work, temporary setbacks cannot discourage them, and they move forward firmly towards their established goals. It is precisely for this reason that the party requires our cadres to systematically and diligently engage in self-study in order to master Marxist-Leninist theory.\n\n    Bolshevik principle-mindedness is an intolerance of all shortcomings, and it is cultivated in a highly serious situation. Regarding educating cadres in the spirit of principle-mindedness, no matter how much one talks about it, if the party committee does not show sufficient seriousness and indulges the mistakes of staff members, it will cause serious harm to the Bolshevik cadre education. For example, this practical situation exists in the Voroshilovgrad Provincial Party Committee. Not long ago, representatives of the State Planning Commission exposed the fact that the \"Krasnoluch Coal Mine\" Trust and the \"Kadiev Coal Mine\" Trust had overreported the amount of coal mined in the mines. He notified the leading comrades of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Provincial Committee, and it was estimated that it would be dealt with. However, the Provincial Party Committee did not show sufficient principle-mindedness, did not pay attention to the actions of the leaders of the two enterprises in violating the interests of the state, and did not subject them to punishment.\n\n    To be a principled person means to not be afraid of offending anyone and to frankly and sincerely point out their shortcomings. Leaders should be good at \"expressing their opinions with all the frankness inherent in Bolsheviks...,\" \"as clearly and openly as Bolsheviks...\" (Stalin on the Problems of Leninism, 11th edition, pp. 398, 144). At the same time, a principled person is not afraid of courageous, frank, and objective criticism himself.\n\n    Criticism is the soul of the Bolshevik cadre education method. An staff member's principle-mindedness can also be tested by his attitude towards criticism. An staff member cannot regard Bolshevik's beneficial criticism as an insult to himself, as damage to his prestige, and therefore put self-esteem above the interests of work. He should have the courage to criticize others and also be good at accepting criticism bravely. (⑴⑵)\n\n    \"Any organization, without criticism, will become corrupt. Without criticism, any problem can penetrate deep into the marrow and be difficult to treat. Only bold and open criticism can help people become more and more perfect, can promote people to move forward, and overcome shortcomings in their work. Where there is no criticism, it will rot and mold from the roots, stop moving forward, and there is no possibility of progress.\" (Zhdanov)\n\n    Unfortunately, there are still some staff members whose intolerance of criticism even threatens to retaliate against so-called \"bullies,\" and sometimes they actually threaten to do so. As an example, Comrade Ivanenko, a party member, and some other comrades correctly criticized some serious shortcomings in the work of the dispatching office of the Moscow-Kursk Railway and Comrade Smirnov, the director of the office. Smirnov did not listen to the criticism and correct the serious shortcomings in his work in the spirit of Bolshevism. Instead, he removed Comrade Ivanenko's job. Even after Ivanenko was reinstated to his job by order of the ministry, Smirnov forcibly reduced her job position. According to her specialty, she was originally an engineer, but now she was asked to be a statistician. What is strange is that the leaders of the railway bureau's party organization turned a blind eye to this and, in fact, condoned Comrade Smirnov's incorrect actions.\n\n    The existence of such a situation of solving problems by handling household affairs is not allowed. Solving problems without criticism and self-criticism hinders the exposure and correction of shortcomings and is harmful to the education of staff members as political activists.\n\n    What are the consequences of a lack of principle-mindedness and the absence of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism? In the example of the Kurgan Provincial Party Committee, it can be seen very clearly: Comrade Sharapov, the former secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, replaced the party's principle-mindedness in his work with friendly relations. A harmonious and complacent atmosphere formed in the Provincial Party Committee, and indiscipline and dissoluteness appeared among the party and Soviet activists. Comrade Sharapov himself did not care about his work, and there were such situations: when the rural work was in full swing, he went to visit his friends and acquaintances! What were the results? As a result, the sowing in many areas of the province was not carried out well, and the work of harvesting and paying grain was also not prepared well. The members of the Provincial Party Committee were aware of all these situations, but they did not oppose this non-Bolshevik habit cultivated by the leaders of the Provincial Party Committee. This showed that they were unprincipled people, philistines rather than political activists.\n\n    Unprincipled staff members often lose their independence and initiative and pursue material enjoyment. Staff members who are tied up lose the possibility of criticizing others. The members of the Kurgan Provincial Party Committee showed a lack of principle-mindedness in their many relationships with the Provincial Party Committee, because some of them had repeatedly received bonuses on the proposal of Comrade Sharapov. This was also one of the reasons why they forgave each other's mistakes.\n\n    Unprincipledness and vulgarization are often the result of not adhering to the Bolshevik principles of selecting and distributing cadres. Comrade Stalin taught us to select cadres according to political standards—that is, to see whether the staff member is politically reliable, and also according to professional standards—that is, to see whether he is suitable for such a specific job. Wherever these principles are violated, wherever cadres are selected only based on family, vulgar, and friendly relations, regardless of whether they are politically and professionally suitable, there will be favorable conditions for flattering and protecting shortcomings in their work. What is obtained is not a leading core based on principles, \"not a responsible leading group, but a small family of close people, but such a combination, its members all strive to live in peace, not offend each other, not wash dirty linen in public, and brag to each other...\" (Stalin).\n\n    In this case, there is no question of a high degree of seriousness towards staff members. In Ulyanovsk, there are many facts that show serious shortcomings. For example, the city management is ignored, the residents often have no lights, tap water is sometimes available and sometimes not, and the streets are full of dirty things. Comrade Deringeyev, the secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, turned a blind eye to this and showed a liberal attitude towards the culprits of dereliction of duty in city management. All this is because Deringeyev had previously worked in the Far East. At that time, he brought with him several staff members who were \"suitable\" for him to Ulyanovsk. Now he has not shown a sufficient objective attitude towards the work of these people, and because of friendship, he has forgiven them in every possible way!\n\n    Ideological education of cadres is our current major task. New cadres are constantly growing up, and they must be educated with Bolshevik traditions, developing their good character and qualities. A high degree of principle-mindedness and theoretical nature are the outstanding characteristics and most important qualities of Lenin-Stalin style staff members. Educating cadres with principle-mindedness and the determination to overcome difficulties will promote the more successful realization of the tasks of the new five-year plan and the task of building communism in our country. (Translated from the September 25, 1947 issue of Pravda)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 论布尔什维克的原则性\n蓝列波巨\n1948-02-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    论布尔什维克的原则性\n    蓝列波巨作\n    亚天贰译\n    列宁和斯大林教导我们说，原则性的政策是唯一正确的政策，我们的党不能容忍有丝毫的不坚定性与无原则性的表现。要求我们工作人员能经常不打折扣的完成自己的任务；经常站在政治活动家的岗位。\n    布尔什维克的原则性，就是对一切稍微脱离党的原则思想和政策的倾向之不可调和的精神。党的政策是苏维埃制度之生命的源泉。党的工作者，在自己一切大小工作中应以党的政策为行动指南，从政治的原则性的路线出发。\n    列宁教导我们说，政治是从联系到千百万人民利益的事情出发；是原则地从政治上去对待问题。就是说，要从千百万人及他们之间相互关系的观点来观察问题。这就不能在本位主义的地方性的朋友关系等利益面前作丝毫的让步。布尔什维克重视友情、同志关系。但是，他认为评定一个人行为的最高标准，是看这个人如何对待由苏维埃国家所代表的人民利益。\n    列宁写道：“我们承认同志间的义务，承认有援助一切同志的义务，承认有耐心听取同志意见的义务；但对我们来说，同志间的义务是从对俄国的、和世界社会民主党的义务产生出来的，不能把它颠倒过来”。（列宁全集二卷五四一——五四二页）\n    由此可见，在原则性的精神上教育干部，这就是说，必须作到在决定任何问题时，干部不是从私人的或地方的利益出发，而是从国家的利益出发。在一切场合坚持这种利益，并与反国家的倾向作斗争。每个工作人员的布尔什维克的原则性，表现在他对自己所担负的工作之态度上，而检查他的原则性，就看他是否把自己的工作服从于国家当地的重大政治任务。评定一切措施的标准是：这些措施是巩固还是削弱我们的伟大事业；促进这件伟大事业的继续发展，还是妨碍其发展。这一点也应作为测量一切工作人员之布尔什维克原则性的标准。\n    现实在证明着不善于正确判断各种现象，和不善于有原则地对待问题，会受到严重的损失。拿“星”及“列宁格勒”两杂志编辑部所犯的错误为例来说——这些错误被联共中央及时地揭发了。这些杂志的实质在什么地方呢？就在于“星”和“列宁格勒”两杂志的领导工作人员，不是把正确的教导苏联人民、和政治上指导文学工作者的活动的利益，作为对待文学工作者的关系之依据；而是以私人的朋友的——就是说庸俗的利益，为其对待文学工作者的关系之依据。由于他们不愿意破裂朋友的关系，所以他们对没有价值的、反艺术的、脱离政治的作品不作批评；由于他们害怕得罪朋友，便登载了非常不适当的作品。联共中央的决议里说道：“这种自由主义，把人民的与国家的利益，正确的教育我们青年的利益，作了朋友关系的牺牲品；它闭塞了批评，结果是作家们停止继续深造，丧失他们对人民对国家与对党的责任感。他们也就停止前进了！”或者我们再拿对外国阿谀逢迎的事实来看一看。很显然，我们一部分落后的知识分子，还是没有摆脱掉这个可耻的毛病。一些党的和经济的领导者们，不用苏联民族自豪的精神来教育人们，却对媚外的奴颜婢膝事实谋妥协，这还不是无原则性的表现吗？这说明需要在一切问题上表现原则性，在党的工作中，尤其必要从政治上处理问题的态度——是党的工作中的基本态度。斯大林同志教导我们说：“党的生活与党的工作之基础，不在于党在当时所采取的、或能够采用的那一些组织形式，而在于党的政策与党的对内和对外的政策”。（列宁斯大林论党的建设二卷四一九页）。这就是说我们的工作人员，应当不仅是好的组织者，熟练的实际工作者，而且也是政治上成熟、思想上坚定的人。\n    深刻的思想，对马列主义伟大思想之正确性的坚定的信念，便是布尔什维克的原则性之基础。只有在原则上坚定不移，很好的掌握了马列主义思想的人，才能具有战斗的布尔什维克的原则性，才能从党的原则立场上去对待问题。\n    马列主义的理论，给予干部以光明的前途，使他们在工作中具有信心。这种理论发展他们的才能，使其能从小的事情，看到大的事情；能从日常的眼前的工作中，感觉到是在为了伟大的理想而斗争；反之对理论上不关心的态度，便会使其失掉前途。论到不关心理论的人们时，斯大林同志说过：他们有从政治活动家，变成为政治上的庸人，变成无原则的脱离政治的事务主义者。\n    斯大林同志说：“关于这种游离不定的人们，伟大的俄国作家果戈里曾颇中肯地讲过：‘那些没有定见的人物，是既非此又非彼，反正你不能理解他们是些什么人，简直是非驴非马。’”（列宁、斯大林论党的建设二卷六九○页）。\n    精通马列主义的理论，乃是在思想上、原则性上教育我们干部的方法，同时也是提高他们战斗力的最重要的方法。伟大马列主义的思想，乃是我们干部精神力量之活的源泉，是干部之坚决性及其在克服困难中之不枯竭的精力之活的源泉。实际的经验在在都证明着思想开展的人们，在实践中也是有力量的，他们在工作中有更大的信心，暂时的失利不能使他们灰心，他们坚强地向既定的目标前进。正因为如此，党便要求我们的干部，有系统的努力地进行自我学习，以精通马列主义的理论。\n    布尔什维克的原则性，是一种对一切缺点的不能容忍性，它是在高度严肃性的情况中养成的。关于以原则性的精神教育干部，尽管高谈阔论，但如果党的委员会不表现足够的严肃性，姑息地对待工作人员的错误，那么便会给布尔什维克的干部教育，招致严重的危害。比如在伏罗希洛夫格勒省党委中就存在着这种实际情况，不久以前国家计划局的代表，揭发了“克拉斯诺銮煤矿”托拉斯和“卡堂也夫煤矿”托拉斯两企业中多报矿井中采煤量的事实，他将这些通知了联共省党委的领导同志，据估计将会加以处理。但省党委没有表现出足够的原则性，没有注意两企业中领导者违反国家利益的行动，没有使他们受到处分。\n    作一个有原则性的人，就是说不怕得罪任何人，而直爽地诚恳地指出他们的缺点，领导者应当善于“用布尔什维克所固有的那种全部直爽态度发表自己的意见………”，“象布尔什维克那样明白而公开………”（斯大林论列宁主义问题十一版三九八页一四四页）。同时有原则性的人，他本身也不怕勇敢的坦白的客观的批评。\n    批评乃是布尔什维克干部教育方法的灵魂，在对批评的态度上，也可以检验一个工作人员的原则性，一个工作人员不能把布尔什维克的有益的批评，看作是对自己的侮辱，看作是对自己的威信的损害，因而把自尊心看得高于工作的利益，他应当有勇气批评别人，也善于勇敢地接受批评。（⑴⑵）\n    “任何一个组织，没有批评的话，都会腐朽的，没有批评则任何毛病可以深入膏肓，较难治疗。只有大胆的公开的批评，才能帮助人们变得日益完善，才能促起人们前进，克服工作中的缺点。凡是没有批评的地方，那里便从根上腐烂发霉，停止不前，那里便没有可能前进”。（日丹诺夫）\n    可惜还有一些工作人员，对批评的不能容忍态度，竟以报复所谓“欺侮者”相威胁，而有时竟然实际的威胁起来了。可举这样一件事实为例：党员伊万年科同志，曾同其他一些同志正确批评了莫斯科——库尔斯克铁路配车处的工作中的一些严重的缺点和该处处长斯米尔诺夫同志，斯米尔诺夫不去倾听批评与按照布尔什维克的精神改正工作中的严正缺点，反而把伊万年科同志的工作撤掉了，甚至当伊万年科奉部令恢复了工作之后，斯米尔诺夫却硬降低了她的工作职位，按她的专门技能，本是工程师，现在却要她当统计员。奇怪的是铁路局党组织的领导者们，对此熟视无睹，事实上是助长了斯米尔诺夫同志的不正确的行动。\n    不能容许这样一种用处理家务事的办法来解决问题的情况之存在，没有批评与自我批评的解决问题，妨碍对缺点的揭发与纠正，对教育作为政治活动家的工作人员是有危害的。\n    缺乏原则性，没有布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，有时会得到什么结果呢？在库尔罕省党委的实例中，可以看得很明显：该省党委的前任书记沙拉波夫同志，以朋友关系代替了工作中的党的原则性，省党委中形成了一种一团和气、泰然自若的风气，党的与苏维埃的积极分子中间，出现了无纪律性与放荡散漫的分子。沙拉波夫同志自己不关心工作，竟有这样的情形：当农村工作火热的时候，他却去找自己的朋友和熟人游逛去了！这样得到了什么结果呢？结果是该省许多区里播种进行得不好，收割与交纳粮食的工作也准备得很不好，省党委的委员们都知道这一切情形，但对省党委领导者所养成的这种非布尔什维克的习性，不进行反对，这样便表明了他们是无原则性的人，是庸人而非政治的活动家。\n    无原则性的工作人员，其结果往往是失掉独立性与自动性，追求物质享受的工作人员，把自己束缚起来，失掉了批评别人的可能性。库尔罕省党委的委员们，在对省委有许多的关系上，表现了无原则性，就因为他们中间有一些人按着沙拉波夫同志的提议几度获得了奖金，这也是他们彼此互相原谅错误的原因之一。\n    无原则性、庸俗化也常常是不遵守布尔什维克原则挑选与分配干部的结果。斯大林同志教导我们要根据政治的标准来挑选干部——就是说：要看该工作人员在政治上是否是可靠的，也要根据业务的标准——就是说：看他是否适于这样一种具体工作。凡是违反这些原则的地方，凡是挑选干部只根据家庭的、庸俗的、朋友的关系，不管他们政治上和业务上是否适当，那里便要替吹拍逢迎与在工作中互相包庇缺点造成有利的条件，得到的不是在原则基础上的领导核心，“不是负责的领导集团，而是亲近人们的小家庭，而是这样一种组合，它的组员都力求和平共居，彼此不相得罪，家丑不可外扬，互相吹嘘…………”（斯大林）。\n    在这种情况下，根本谈不到对工作人员的高度严肃性。在乌梁诺夫斯克有很多事实表现出了严重的缺点，比如城市管理无人过问，居民们常常没灯光，自来水忽有忽无，满街是脏东西，省委书记德林吉也夫同志对此熟视无睹，对于城市管理失职的罪人，表现了自由主义的态度，这一切正因为德林吉也夫从前曾在远东工作，当时，他便随身把几个对于他是“合适”的工作人员，带到乌梁诺夫斯克来，现在他对于这些人的工作，也未表现出足够的客观态度，而因朋友关系，对他们就百般地原谅了！\n    对干部进行思想教育，这是我们当前的重大任务，新的干部不断的增长起来，必须以布尔什维克的传统教育他们，发展其优良的性格与品质，高度的原则性与理论性，乃是列宁——斯大林式的工作人员之卓越的特点与最重要的品质，以原则性与克服困难的坚决性教育干部，将会促进更加顺利的实现新五年计划的任务，与在我们国家内建设共产主义的任务。（译自一九四七年九月二十五日真理报）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Singapore - The people of Malaya have risen up in opposition to Britain's establishment of the Malayan Union and the implementation of a new constitutional system, believing it to be a new shackle for British imperialism to control Malaya. When the Malayan Union was formally established on the first of this month, and Sir Gent took office as the British High Commissioner to the new Malayan Union in Kuala Lumpur that morning, Singapore erupted in a protest strike by 30,000 workers. The offices of Malayan left-wing political parties all flew flags at half-mast in mourning. The Malayan Democratic Union headquarters also held a mass meeting, exposing the British political conspiracy to establish the Malayan Union, aimed at strengthening the policy of division among all ethnic groups, especially the Chinese, through collusion with the reactionary Malay states. This would unswervingly maintain the British imperialist enslavement rule in Malaya. The meeting sent a telegram to the British government in London, demanding the immediate abolition of the new constitution. Under the call of the Singapore Federation of Trade Unions, British public bus drivers, government employees, dock workers, mechanics, and coal miners are now all involved in the strike wave. Prior to this, the Pan-Malayan Council of Joint Action, with 440,000 members, had joined the Malayan National United Front to form a standing committee, establishing a leadership organization in Kuala Lumpur to launch a movement against the Malayan Union Constitution, drafting a draft \"People's Charter,\" and announcing a boycott of the Malayan Union Council on the 19th of last month. The British Malayan Union plan was officially published in a blue book at the end of 1946. The main reactionary contents of the Malayan Union plan and the new constitution are: (1) Replacing the Malayan Union with the Malayan Federation, with each state retaining its original privileges. (2) Separating Singapore from the Malayan Federation, making it a separate administrative region under the direct rule of the British government. (3) The Federation is controlled by a Supreme Commissioner appointed by the United Kingdom, who holds administrative and legislative power and may appoint British officials without citizenship as members of the Legislative Council. All members of the Legislative Council are appointed by the Commissioner. (4) Regarding the issue of citizenship, the regulations stipulate: Those who have resided in the area for fifteen years and whose parents were both born in the state; those who were not born in the Malayan Federation must apply for approval from the Federation's Senior Commissioner before they can obtain citizenship. (5) Regarding the number of members of the Federal Legislative Council, it is stipulated that there will be a total of 75, of which British official members account for 25.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对英帝制造“马来亚联邦”  新加坡爆发大罢工  马来亚民主阵线总部举行群众大会\n\n1948-02-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    反对英帝制造“马来亚联邦”\n    新加坡爆发大罢工\n    马来亚民主阵线总部举行群众大会\n    【新华社陕北六日电】新加坡讯：马来亚人民群起反对英国成立马来亚联邦及实施新宪制。认为这是英帝国主义控制马来亚的新枷锁。当本月一日马来亚联邦宣告成立、金德爵士是日晨在吉隆坡正式就任英驻新马来亚联邦高级专员时，新加坡爆发了三万名工人的抗议大罢工。马来亚左翼政党之办公处均下半旗致哀。马来亚民主阵线总部亦举行群众大会，揭露英国成立马来亚联邦之政治阴谋，旨在通过与马来亚反动土邦的勾结，加强对各民族特别是对华侨的分化政策。以原封不动地维护英帝国主义在马来亚的奴役统治。大会通电伦敦英政府，要求立即废止新宪法。在新加坡总工会号召下，英商公共汽车司机工人、政府公务员、码头工人、机工及煤矿工人，现均卷入罢工浪潮。在此以前，拥有四十四万会员的泛马来亚政团联合行动委员会，曾联合马来亚民族统一战线，组成常务委员会，在吉隆坡设立领导机构，发起反马来亚联邦宪法运动，起草“人民宪章”草案，并于上月十九日宣布抵制马来亚联邦议会。按英国之马来亚联邦计划于一九四六年年底正式以蓝皮书公布。马来亚联邦计划及新宪法之主要反动内容为：（一）以马来亚联邦代替马来亚联盟，各土邦得保持其原有特权。（二）新加坡与马来亚联邦分离，单独成为一行政区，归英政府直接统治。（三）由英国任命最高专员控制联邦，掌握行政、立法大权；并可指派无公民权之英籍官吏任立法会议议员。而所有立法会议议员均由专员指定。（四）关于公民权问题规定：须在该地居住十五年及父母均系出生于该邦，其非出生于马来亚联邦者，须申请联邦高级专员核准，方能取得公民资格。（五）关于联邦立法会议议员名额，规定共七十五名，而其中英官吏议员却占二十五名。"

It was just twelve days after Fu Zuoyi came to power and directed the bandit soldiers and generals of the Ninety-Fourth Army to burn and loot in this area. The affected people, when they saw the People's Liberation Army, said with tears in their eyes: \"Alas! If you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to live.\" In An'yang Village, eighteen miles north of Laishui, many old people, children, and women rushed to tell the soldiers: The bandit army, greedy at the sight of anything, had arrested their sons, husbands, and brothers, etc. Before they could say a few words, they began to sob and cry together, asking the soldiers to avenge them. Taking An'yang Village as an example, out of the three hundred households in the whole village, one hundred and four houses were burned, more than seventy people were arrested, their whereabouts unknown, and a lot of food and belongings were looted. The old and childless couple, Wang Zongjiang, only had an old cotton quilt left. In the cold winter, the old woman sat on the kang, wrapped in the quilt, and cursed: \"These damned beasts, they want everything, shameless!\" Speaking of the burning situation, Sun Shigong's woman said with a trembling voice: \"As soon as the bandit army entered the house, they shouted 'Light it! Light it!' Once it was lit, the wind howled, and the house was filled with black smoke, blocking the sun. Watching the family property burn to ashes, we weren't allowed to save it.\" The villagers ran away when they heard the news. Liu Shuan's sister, who was at home, was shot because she couldn't run away. Those who were captured alive were imprisoned in Laishui City, and it cost dozens of dan of grain to redeem one person. When they were being tied up, the bandit army said: \"You have five days to redeem them, or else you will come and carry the dead bodies.\" Old woman Niu, who was over sixty years old, risked her life to send food to her son, Niu Jinhai. When she saw him, he was no longer human. His face was the color of mud, the ice on his beard was three or four inches long, and his cotton coat had been stripped off. He was shivering in a cold cellar and couldn't speak. There was also an open pit, the bottom of which was frozen into ice with splashed water. People were forced to squat down barefoot. Gao Yu＠, who was sixty-seven years old and had a stubborn personality, was stripped to only a set of underwear, half of his body was buried in the ground and splashed with water, and he was wearing a cangue around his neck. He was frozen and starved to death in a few days. Also, the two daughters-in-law of Sun Chengfeng's family were arrested and ran back after two days. When asked for details, they hated so much that they gritted their teeth and refused to say anything. Fu Zuoyi recently scolded the People's Liberation Army, saying: \"Their evil is more obvious, and their crimes are more evident.\" This is exactly the crime he has defined himself. Now \"Avenge Fu Zuoyi!\" has become the passionate action of our army and people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 向傅作义复仇\n杨朔\n1948-02-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    向傅作义复仇\n    杨朔\n    一九四七年大年三十，记者随军来到平汉北线涞水、涿县一带，正当傅作义上台后，指使九十四军的贼兵贼将，在这一片大烧大抢的后十二天，受害的人民见到解放军，流着泪道：“唉！你们再不来，没法活了。”涞水以北十八里的安阳村，许多老幼妇女，赶着对战士诉说：见东西就眼红的匪军，怎样逮走了她的儿子、男人、哥哥等，说不几句，就呜咽起来，哭作一团，要战士替她们报仇。单拿安阳村来说，全村三百来户，便烧了一百零四间房子，逮起七十多人，死活不知，抢走粮食东西很多。王宗江老绝户夫妇只剩了一条旧棉被，隆冬数九，老太太坐在炕头上，裹着那条被骂道：“这些该死的牲口，什么都要，死不要脸！”讲到烧的情形，孙士工的女人颤着声音说：“匪军一进屋，就叫‘点火！点火！’一点火，风呼呼地，房子冒着黑烟，把日头都遮了，眼看家当烧成灰，也不许救。”村里人听见风声就跑，刘拴在家的妹子跑不及被崩了。活逮走的都囚在涞水城，一个人要几十石粮食去赎，临绑走匪军还说：“限五天来赎，不赎就来抬死尸。”六十多岁的牛大娘，冒着死去给儿子牛金海送吃的，一看早不象人样了，脸是泥皮色，胡子上的冰三四寸长，棉袄也叫人剥光，关在冷地窑里打哆嗦，话都不会说了。还有个露天大坑，坑底泼的水冻成冰，硬叫人赤着脚蹲在下边，六十七岁的高玉＠性子顽强，被剥得只剩一套单衣，下半身埋在地里泼上水，脖子上带着枷，不几天活活冻饿死了。又有孙程峰家的妯娌俩，被抓去两天又跑回来，问他们细情，恨得咬着牙不肯明言。傅作义最近曾骂解放军说：“其恶益著，其罪益彰。”正是自定的罪状。现在“向傅作义复仇！”已经是我军民激昂的行动了。"

    "content": "[Taihang News] The factional fighting incident between Xiawan Village in Licheng and Xiangtangpu Village in She County, incited by landlords and bad village cadres, has been resolved after the administrative office and the county governments of Licheng and She mobilized poor and hired peasants, united the middle peasants, and jointly punished the masterminds and culprits. The details of the incident and its handling are summarized below:\n\nOn December 25th of last year, fifteen people from Xiangtangpu Village went to cut firewood on a forbidden mountain in the southwest of Xiawan Village. Wang Xiaotun, the militia instructor of Xiawan Village, Wang Sigen, the deputy instructor and public security officer, and Xu Dekui, the deputy village chief, upon learning of this, led the militia to the mountain to block them with weapons; Wang Xiaotun and Wang Sigen even fired shots and threw grenades as a show of force. Li Yinshuo, a district cadre working in Xiawan, and Yang Zhifa, the political director of Xiangtangpu, upon hearing the gunfire, went to the mountain to mediate. After discussion, the result was: the cut firewood would be stored separately by the two villages and not used temporarily until the issue was resolved. Later, Yang Zhifa saw that more and more people from Xiangtangpu Village were arriving, and he immediately changed his mind, saying, \"The masses do not agree to store it separately; I cannot control it.\" He incited the crowd, causing both sides to fight over the firewood, and as a result, all the firewood was taken away by Xiangtangpu.\n\nMost of the masses thought the matter was over. However, the landlords, rich peasants, and rogue cadres of the two villages took the opportunity to instigate and create incidents. Xiangtangpu, led by political director Yang Zhifa and farmers' association director Wu Yuming, wrote a \"challenge\" letter to Xiawan overnight, falsely claiming the opinions of the masses: \"It must be cut in the future.\" They sent cadres to the people's school to \"mobilize\" the masses, saying, \"We must go and cut.\" Wu Yuming even verbally notified Shentou, Gouzhuang, Qiankuanzhang, and Houkuanzhang villages to go and cut firewood, attempting to expand the situation. This plan was not realized due to the snowfall. They told two district cadres who were attending a meeting in the village about this plan, and the bureaucratic district cadres, without investigating the details, approved it, saying it was a \"good idea.\" Xiawan Village, led by village chief Li Tingtang and farmers' association director Zheng Laohu, held mass meetings to \"mobilize\" resistance to cutting firewood and \"selected\" eight representatives to prepare to file a lawsuit. At the same time, they wrote back to Xiangtangpu: \"You must not cut it\"; and designated political director Zhang Zangzi (who was used by bad cadres) to file a complaint with the county government. Upon hearing this news, the county governments of Licheng and She immediately issued an order to \"suspend cutting firewood and await processing,\" but the cadres of Xiangtangpu completely ignored it. The cadres of Xiawan Village also wanted to continue the disturbance.\n\nOn January 11th, Xiangtangpu, after a \"general mobilization,\" had more than twenty people go to the forbidden mountain to cut firewood. Li Tingtang, the village chief of Xiawan Village, Zheng Laohu, the director of the farmers' association, and others ordered that no one in the village was allowed to go out and all were to prepare to block the firewood cutting; they instructed village deputy Xu Dekui to lead six people to the mountain first. Li Tingtang, Wang Xiaotun, and five others also followed them up the mountain, and Li Tingtang took the lead in grabbing two farmers from Xiangtangpu who were cutting firewood. Feng Yuanxin, the deputy of Xiangtangpu Village, upon hearing this news, immediately broadcast to the whole village: \"Everyone must go up the mountain to seize the firewood, and each merchant is only allowed to leave one person to look after the house.\" Some bad elements also encouraged from the sidelines, \"concentrating\" thirty to forty people who were forced to go up the mountain. Many honest farmers were unwilling to go but did not dare to object. Zhang Yuxi, the production director of the village, took the opportunity to shout on the mountain: \"Come quickly, our villagers are being dragged down and carried away!\" He only incited and teased others, while he watched the excitement from the sidelines. After these incitements, the masses of Xiangtangpu kept pouring into Xiawan, and both sides started fighting. Wang Badan, a scoundrel from Xiawan, encouraged others to fight everywhere, but he secretly left. Li Tingtang, Zheng Laohu, and other bad cadres, the culprits of the village, seeing the chaotic fight, also took the opportunity to run away. As a result, three or four farmers from each village were seriously injured. Xiawan, being outnumbered, fled west. The people of Xiangtangpu then captured four farmers in the village. Just as they were about to return, district cadre Li Yinshuo saw that one of them was Li Kuahai, a correspondent from the administrative office's hospital, and negotiated his release. Wu Yuming, the director of the farmers' association of Xiangtangpu, and the rogue scoundrel Cheng Lao Si said: \"The last time he fired the gun was under the leadership of worker Li (a false accusation), and this time he released the thug Li Kuahai.\" They incited the cadres and ordered the masses to arrest Li Yinshuo and Li Kuahai together and drag them back to the village. This time, the landlord Nai Ting also took the opportunity to join in, and the cadres even thought he was \"one of our own.\" From the road to the village, Zhang Yuxi led a few people to beat Yinshuo, Kuahai, and others severely. Zhang Yuxi also insulted Li Yinshuo as a \"traitor and special agent, eating public millet, it is better to feed it to dogs, let him 'ride in a foreign car' (meaning to be dragged).\" That night, they were all detained. In the dark, Li Yinshuo took the opportunity to escape back to the district, while the others were suspended and did not escape. When the masses heard that worker Li had been dragged and beaten, they all reflected that it was wrong, but they were scolded by Wu Yuming and other cadres. After the beating, the masses of Xiawan Village immediately ran to the district and county governments for help. Pin Gu Tang hid in a mountain cave for two days and two nights without food and did not dare to go back.\n\nAfter receiving the report, the Taihang Administrative Office immediately sent Comrade Geng Zhenlin to cooperate with the cadres of Licheng and She counties to investigate and deal with the matter separately. When they first arrived, the masses of the two villages were very uneasy, and the landlords and rogue cadres secretly encouraged the masses to fight to the end, resisting with all their might. Comrade Geng and others then convened a general meeting to announce: \"Beating people, especially beating farmers, is against the law. This matter is entirely the responsibility of the village cadres, and the masses are blindly following. Now, everyone should be released first, and all firewood cutting on the forbidden mountain should be stopped. Who is right and who is wrong will be investigated and resolved later. We farmers of the world are one family. We fight each other, making the landlords happy. We will not fall for this trick.\" Both villages did so, and the emotions of the masses began to stabilize. The cadres felt that they were wrong and could no longer resist, so they began to lower their heads. At this time, the county and district cadres decided to handle this factional dispute from a class perspective. On the one hand, they organized cadres to hold meetings to reflect, and on the other hand, they started from inspecting the land reform, mobilizing the poor peasants and hired laborers, uniting the middle peasants, reviewing the cadres, and finally handling the matter through democratic discussion. The mobilization of the poor peasants and hired laborers began with the issue of fighting, but they were not interested. Some still spoke from the village's perspective. Seeing that this method was not right, the county and district cadres immediately changed their approach, setting aside the fighting and directly talking about the poor life of the poor peasants and hired laborers. In Xiawan Village, they found Zhang Yueming, a sixty-year-old hired laborer with a blood lineage, and from reminiscing about the past to the turn over, they learned about the situation of the village cadres in detail. He said: \"Fighting is caused by the cadres being full and messing around, making the masses uneasy.\" The cadres relied on him to collude with eleven or twelve poor peasants and hired laborers, and then mobilized them to collude with all the poor peasants and hired laborers. In the process of colluding and mobilizing, on the one hand, they complained about the bitterness of \"not turning over,\" and on the other hand, they promoted the Land Law: \"Let us poor people be the masters of our own house, fight against feudalism, and replace bad cadres\"; and emphasized: \"Fighting is intentionally disrupting the harmony of us farmers, inducing us to forget about fighting the landlords and moving stones. We will not be fooled!\" After colluding and mobilizing for five or six days, they convened a general meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers to review the cadres and discuss the handling methods. Everyone accused the bad cadres who led the fighting, and according to the size of the past crimes, they put forward handling opinions. Finally, they discussed: \"Uniting the middle peasants, with more people and strength, can overthrow the bad cadres.\" They unanimously proposed: Each person should unite two or three middle peasants. At this time, the middle peasants reflected: \"The honest people are really fair,\" which further encouraged the poor peasants and hired laborers to boldly stand up and lead. In a very short time, they united all the middle peasants, and then convened a mass meeting, electing three poor peasants to be the presidium to lead. Xiangtangpu's approach was the same as Xiawan's. The mass meeting of Xiawan Village decided: Li Tingtang was removed from the position of village chief, released on bail with a guarantee, not allowed to be active, and all family property was registered and sealed. Zheng Laohu, the director of the farmers' association, was dismissed, fined 30,000 catties of firewood, released on bail with a guarantee, not allowed to be active, and not allowed to use family property at will. Zhang Zangzi, the political director, was dismissed. Wang Xiaotun, the militia instructor, was dismissed. Wang Sigen, the deputy instructor and public security officer, was dismissed and fined 20,000 catties of firewood. Xu Dekui, the deputy village chief, was given a major demerit. The mass meeting of Xiangtangpu decided: Wu Yuming, the director of the farmers' association, and Zhang Yuxi, the production director, who were the most active in leading the fighting, were dismissed and sent to the county government for handling. Yuxi compensated worker Li for 20,000 yuan in medical expenses. Feng Yuanxin, the village deputy, was dismissed and fined 1,500 catties of firewood. Yang Zhifa, the political director, and Feng Zhuting, the deputy public security officer, were leniently treated with a major demerit each because they were active in fighting the landlords and doing other work. The scoundrels Wang Badan and Cheng Lao San from both villages were also punished as they deserved.\n\nOn January 28th, each village selected twenty representatives of poor peasants and middle peasants, along with cadres from each village, to convene a joint meeting for a celebration. Each made a self-criticism and unanimously recognized: \"These sectarian contradictions were passed down from the old society and were the means by which landlords ruled and harmed us poor people, and we must resolutely overthrow them.\" Finally, it was decided: the mountain is still a forbidden mountain, and both sides will go together to mark it clearly. Back home, they must carry out ideological education among the masses on \"farmers of the world are one family\" and unite well. In the future, in supporting the front, they must be considerate of each other and help solve difficulties. This meeting was extremely harmonious from beginning to end.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 坏村干挑动下湾向堂铺两村打架  行署依靠贫雇圆满解决  撤换坏干部。两村派代表联欢\n\n1948-02-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    坏村干挑动下湾向堂铺两村打架\n    行署依靠贫雇圆满解决\n    撤换坏干部。两村派代表联欢\n    【太行消息】黎城下湾、涉县向堂铺两村，在地主及坏村干挑动下发生的宗派殴打事件，经行署及黎、涉两县府发动雇贫、团结中农，联合惩办了主谋祸首分子，已经获得解决。现将事情的经过和处理情形，摘要报导于后：\n    去年十二月二十五日，向堂铺群众十五人，到下湾村西南一座禁山上割柴。下湾民兵指导员王小吞、副指导员兼公安员王四根、副村长徐德魁知道了，带领民兵上山武装阻拦；王小吞、王四根并打枪、扔手榴弹示威。在下湾工作的区干李银锁和向堂铺政治主任杨志发听到枪声，先后上山调解。商量结果：把割下的柴分别由两村保存，暂不动用，等问题解决后再说。后来杨志发看到向堂铺村人慢慢来的多了，马上变卦，说“群众不同意分开保存，自己掌握不住”。并进行挑动，使双方夺起柴来，结果柴全被向堂铺夺走。\n    一般群众都以为已经了事。但是，两村的地主富农及流氓干部却乘机煽动，制造事件。向堂铺以政治主任杨志发、农会主任武玉明为首，连夜给下湾写了一封“挑战”信，假造群众意见：“今后非割不可”。一面派干部到民校“动员”群众说：“一定要去割”。武玉明更口头通知神头、沟庄、前后宽漳等村也去割，企图扩大事态，后因下雪未成。他们当时给在该村开会的两个区干部说了这个计划，区干部官僚主义的不问底细就批准了，还说是“好办法”。下湾村是以村长李庭堂、农会主任郑老虎为首，召开群众会，“动员”阻拦割柴，还“选”出八个代表，准备专门打官司。同时给向堂铺写回信：“你们一定不能割”；并指定政治主任张脏子（被坏干部利用）到县府告状。黎、涉两县府听到这种消息，立即明令“暂停割柴，听候处理”，但向堂铺干部根本不理。下湾干部也要继续大闹。\n    一月十一日，向堂铺在“总动员”后，又有二十多人到禁山割柴。下湾村村长李庭堂、农会主任郑老虎等，一面下令全村任何人不准外出，都准备拦阻割柴的；一面指示村副徐德魁带领六人先行上山。李庭堂、王小吞等五人也随着上山，李庭堂并先下手抓了向堂铺两个割柴的农民。向堂铺村副冯元新听到这个消息，即向全村广播：“不论谁都得一律上山夺柴，各商户只准留一人看家”。有些坏分子又从旁鼓动，“集中”了三四十人被迫上山，不少老实农民不愿去，但不敢反对。该村生产主任张玉玺更乘机在山上大喊：“赶快来，把咱村人拖倒抬走啦！”他只鼓动与捉弄别人，自己却在一旁看热闹。经过这些挑动，向堂铺群众便一直涌进下湾，双方乱打起来。下湾坏蛋王疤蛋，到处鼓动别人去打，他却偷偷离开。该村祸首李庭堂、郑老虎等坏干部一见乱打起来，也瞅空偷跑了。结果两村农民，各重伤三、四人。下湾因人少抵不住，纷纷向西逃跑。向堂铺的人即在村里抓了四个农民。正要往回走，区干部李银锁见其中有一个是行署医院通讯员李跨孩，即交涉释放了。向堂铺农会主任武玉明和流氓坏蛋程老四说：“上次打枪是李工作员领导（是诬赖），这次又放走打手李跨孩”。随着就鼓动干部、命令群众又把李银锁和李跨孩一齐抓上，拖回村里。这回该村地主乃亭也乘机混入参加，干部还认为是“自己人”。从路上到村里，张玉玺带领少数人将银锁、跨孩等痛打一顿，张玉玺并辱骂李银锁是“汉奸特务，吃了公家小米，不如喂狗，叫他‘坐洋车’（拖拉的意思）”。当晚便都扣起来。黑夜，李银锁瞅空逃回区上，其余都是吊着，没有逃脱。群众听说拖打了李工作员，都反映不对，被武玉明等干部顶了一顿。下湾村群众在殴打后，当即跑到区上、县府求救。贫雇根堂藏到山洞，两天两夜没有吃饭，也不敢回去。\n    太行行署得到报告后，当即派耿振林同志，协同黎、涉两县干干，分别前去调查处理。刚去时两村群众非常不安，地主流氓干部还暗地鼓动群众闹到底，极力抵抗。耿同志等这时便先召集大会，宣布：“打人，特别是打农民是犯法的，这事完全由村干部负责，群众是盲从的。现在都先放人，禁山柴一律停割，谁是谁非，听候查明解决。本来咱天下农民是一家，自己相互打架，让地主高兴，我们不上这个当。”两村都这么作了，群众情绪开始安定。干部已感到自己错了，再抵抗不得，开始低头。这时，县区干部决定用阶级观点处理这一宗派纠纷，一面组织干部开会反省，一面从检查土地改革入手，发动雇贫，团结中农，审查干部，最后由民主讨论处理。开始发动雇贫，先从打架问题谈起，他们不感兴趣，有的还是站在村本位上说话。县区干部看到这种方法不对，马上改变，撇开打架不谈，直接从雇贫眼下的穷生活谈起。在下湾村找到了六十多岁的血统雇贫张约明，从拉时光谈到翻身，把村干部的情形弄了个一清二楚。他说：“打架是干部吃饱饭，没事情瞎胡闹，弄的群众不安。”干部们依托他串通了十一、二个雇贫，又发动他们去串通全体雇贫。在串通过程中，一面诉“没翻身”的苦，一面宣传土地法：“让咱穷人当家，斗争封建，撤换坏干部”；并着重说明：“打架是人家存心破坏咱农民不和气，引诱咱忘掉斗地主，搬石头，咱不上当！”串通发动了五、六天，就召开全体雇贫会，审查干部，讨论处理办法。大家纷纷控告了领导打架的坏干部，并按历来罪恶大小，提出处理意见，最后又讨论：“团结中农，人多气壮，才能斗倒坏干部。”一致提出：每人要团拢两三个中农。中农这时纷纷反映：“老实人办事真公道”，更鼓舞了雇贫大胆挺身出来领导。很短的时间，就团拢起全体中农，接着召开群众大会，选举了三个雇贫农当主席团，出面领导。向堂铺的作法也和下湾一样。下湾村群众大会决定：李庭堂撤销村长职，取保具结，不准活动，家产全部登记查封。农会主任郑老虎撤职，罚柴三万斤，取保具结，不准活动，不准随意动用家产。政治主任张脏子撤职。民兵指导员王小吞撤职。副指导员兼公安员王四根撤职，罚柴两万斤。村副徐德魁记大过一次。向堂铺群众大会决定：领导打架最积极的农会主任武玉明、生产主任张玉玺撤职，送县府处理，玉玺赔偿李工作员医疗费两万元。村副冯元新撤职，罚柴一千五百斤。政治主任杨志发、副公安员冯竹庭因平时斗地主及作其他工作积极，宽大处理，各记大过一次。两村的坏蛋王疤蛋、程老三等，也都受到应得的处分。\n    一月二十八号，两村各选出雇贫和中农代表二十人，连带各村干部，召开联席会议联欢。各自作了检讨，一致认识到：“这些宗派矛盾是旧社会传下来的，是地主统治和糟害咱穷人的手法，要坚决打倒。”最后决定：山还是禁山，双方一块去划清标记。回去要在群众中进行“天下农民是一家人”的思想教育，好好团结。今后在支差中，要互相体贴和帮助解决困难。这个会从头到尾，都表现了格外的融洽。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editorial:\n\n    Adhere to the Correct Line of the Workers' Movement\n    Oppose \"Leftist\" Adventurism\n\n    The first great strike movement of the Chinese working class against the imperialist running-dog warlords – the Beijing-Hankou (i.e., Ping-Han) Railway Great Strike – has now been twenty-five years ago. For twenty-five years, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have commemorated February 7th, this day of great significance, because the Beijing-Hankou Railway Great Strike demonstrated the political consciousness and organization of the Chinese working class, and showed that the working class is the advanced class and the most revolutionary class of the Chinese people.\n\n    Twenty-five years have passed, and the cause left by the \"February 7th\" martyrs, Comrades Shi Yang, Lin Xiangqian, and others, is about to be completed. Imperialism and feudal forces will be swept away throughout China. The democratic power of the working class, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, middle bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and other patriotic elements has been established in the liberated areas with a population of 160 million, and will be established throughout the country. The glorious achievements of the \"February 7th\" martyrs are immortal.\n\n    The Beijing-Hankou Railway Great Strike is a glorious page in the history of our country's revolutionary workers' movement. The current situation is that some major cities, railways, and mines in our country have been liberated, and more major cities, railways, and mines will be liberated. On the other hand, the construction of industry and railways in the liberated areas, especially in the Northeast Liberated Area, is being actively carried out. This kind of construction must be carried out on an even larger scale in the future. Therefore, the workers' movement in the liberated areas will be elevated to a more important position. Whether the direction of the workers' movement is correct will have a greater impact on the development of the revolutionary war and the development of new democratic construction than ever before. We would like to take this opportunity of commemorating the 25th anniversary of \"February 7th\" to explain the direction of the workers' movement in the liberated areas.\n\n    The revolutionary workers' movement in the liberated areas and the revolutionary workers' movement in the KMT-controlled areas have the same general goal, which is to strive for the democratic liberation of the working class and all oppressed people and to establish a new democratic China. However, under the same general goal, the specific directions of the revolutionary workers' movement in the two different regions are different, and in many respects, even diametrically opposed. This is because in these two different regions, the political and social status of workers and their status in enterprises are different, and in many respects are diametrically opposed.\n\n    In the KMT-controlled areas, workers are the lowest slaves in society. Their labor produces profits for imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Their lives are regarded by imperialism and the Kuomintang as worthless as insects. They have no human rights or freedom. In such a tragic environment, the working class must engage in a struggle for survival; and in order to liberate themselves and liberate all oppressed people, they must fight to overthrow the state power of imperialism and the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, just like the \"February 7th\" strike struggle. However, in the liberated areas, the political and social status of workers has fundamentally changed and is diametrically different. Workers, like peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, the middle bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and other patriotic elements, have become the masters of the state and society. The working class is especially respected by all the people because it is the advanced class, the most revolutionary class. In such an environment, the working class must support its own and the people's democratic politics, and play a vanguard and leading role and an exemplary role in striving for the victory of the revolutionary war and the construction of a new democratic society.\n\n    The status of workers in enterprises is also different. In the KMT-controlled areas, there are enterprises of bureaucratic capital and enterprises of national capital. In enterprises of bureaucratic capital, the status of workers is that of slaves of bureaucratic capitalists. Their struggle for survival is often linked to resistance to the oppression of the rulers. In enterprises of national capital, workers are exploited by capitalists, and at the same time, they are oppressed by bureaucratic capital, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit government, and imperialism along with the national capitalists. On the one hand, for the sake of their livelihood, they must make demands on the capitalists to improve their lives; on the other hand, in order to resist the oppression of bureaucratic capital and the rulers, they should unite with the national capitalists and carry out a common struggle. The situation in the liberated areas is diametrically different. In the state-owned enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises in the liberated areas, the owners of the enterprises are the liberated people organized into the political power and cooperatives. Therefore, the workers in these enterprises are themselves the owners of the enterprises. There are no exploiters and exploited, no oppressors and oppressed, and therefore there is no and cannot be any so-called opposition between \"capital\" and \"labor,\" the so-called opposition between \"enterprise owners\" and non-enterprise owners. In private enterprises in the liberated areas, workers have a dual status: one is the status of the exploited, the status of \"labor\"; the other is the status of masters of society, the status of leaders of state power. Because they are exploited, workers have contradictions with private capitalists in their own daily interests; but because they are also the masters of society and the leaders of state power, workers should, for their own long-term interests, endure a certain degree of exploitation, so that these private enterprises can carry out production and appropriately develop production, in order to prosper the economy of the liberated areas, support the victory of the front lines, and enable the new democratic society to gradually and reliably develop in the direction of the future socialist society due to the great increase in productivity. It should be understood that the difference between a new democratic society and a socialist society is that in a new democratic society, the enterprises of private capital are still an indispensable component in production. Destroying this part of the enterprise is very detrimental to the working class and the entire people and their state power. Precisely because of this, workers should resolutely oppose those private capitalists who engage in slowdowns, close factories, and sabotage. At the same time, for private capitalists who are willing to continue production, they should work together with them to develop production and prosper the economy of the liberated areas. And on this basis, on the one hand, ensure the appropriate life of the workers, and on the other hand, ensure the appropriate profits of the private capitalists. This kind of labor-capital relationship is diametrically different from the labor-capital struggle that should be carried out in the KMT-controlled areas.\n\n    From the above basic analysis, it can be seen that in the KMT-controlled areas and the liberated areas, the status of workers in society and in enterprises is so diametrically different.\n\n    From this, it can be understood why the direction of the revolutionary workers' movement in the liberated areas should be diametrically different from the direction of the revolutionary workers' movement in the KMT-controlled areas.\n\n    In the KMT-controlled areas, the direction of the revolutionary workers' movement is to use some methods to protect work so as not to starve to death, and to use all methods to overthrow the reactionary government. In the liberated areas, the revolutionary workers' movement does not have these tasks. Because in the liberated areas, workers do not have the threat of hunger, and the reactionary government has long been overthrown. In the liberated areas, the direction of the revolutionary workers' movement should therefore be completely changed, changed to patiently persuading workers to implement the economic policy of \"increasing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital\" as said by Chairman Mao.\n\n    It should be explained to the workers that revitalizing industry is the most important task for winning the war, and it is also the most important task for building a new democratic society. And destroying or reducing production is harming the liberated areas, harming the victory of the war, and harming the construction of a new democratic society, and its terrible degree is the same as the \"Three Alls Policy\" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.\n\n    It should be explained to the workers that industrial production in the liberated areas is not the responsibility of others, but the responsibility of the working class and its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party. The peasants in the liberated areas deliver a large amount of public grain for agricultural production and perform heavy war service, and they are doing their best to take responsibility. Workers should take the same responsibility for industrial production, not only in state-owned enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises, workers must take complete responsibility for production, but also in private enterprises, workers also bear most of the responsibility, although private capitalists must also be responsible.\n\n    It should be explained to the workers that the reason why workers are respected by the people of the liberated areas is not for any other reason, but only because the working class is the advanced class and the most revolutionary class among the people. Workers should set an example for the people and lead the people forward with their infinite loyalty and great contribution to the revolution. In order to win the victory of the revolutionary war and the success of new democratic construction, workers should endure hardships and do more work, and should learn from many model workers such as Comrade Zhao Zhankui. In the case of war, instead of working eight hours, they should work ten hours. Other labor conditions should also not be set too high, and should not violate the limits permitted by the economic situation, and should not violate the general principles of developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital.\n\n    Workers should be led to learn to manage production. In state-owned enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises, under the leadership of the factory director, a factory management committee should be organized, and worker representatives should be absorbed to participate. Discuss how to reduce costs, increase the quantity and quality of production, and how to solve and improve various complex problems in the process of purchasing raw materials, manufacturing finished products, and selling finished products. This management method can also be persuaded to private capitalists to try out in private enterprises. In the management committee of private enterprises, in addition to discussing the above issues, it can also stipulate a certain profit for private capitalists and a certain treatment for workers, in order to achieve mutual benefit for labor and capital.\n\n    Chairman Mao pointed out in \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks\": \"Taking excessively leftist and erroneous policies towards petty bourgeois and middle bourgeois economic components, such as those we committed during the period from 1931 to 1934, 'excessively high labor conditions, excessively high income tax rates, infringing on industrialists and merchants in land reform, not aiming at developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, but aiming at the short-sighted and one-sided so-called welfare of the workers' is absolutely not allowed. If this error is repeated, it will inevitably damage the interests of the working masses and the interests of the new democratic state.\" This instruction from Chairman Mao is very important for the workers' movement in the liberated areas. Leaders of the workers' movement are absolutely not allowed to aim at the short-sighted, one-sided, so-called welfare of the workers, and to propose excessively high labor conditions. The direction of the workers' movement in the liberated areas should strictly conform to the new democratic economic policy, which is to develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital. Everything that conforms to this should be developed, and everything that violates this should be corrected.\n\n    It must be pointed out that until now, there are still many party members, many cadres, many trade union workers, and even many leading personnel who hold high leading positions in the Chinese Communist Party who do not understand the party's industrial policy and the direction of the workers' movement. They only see the trees and not the forest. They only know the one-sided, narrow, and short-sighted so-called \"workers' interests,\" and cannot look a little further. They have forgotten the great damage that the leftist adventurist industrial policy and the workers' movement line implemented during the period from 1931 to 1934 gave to the working class, the working people, and the revolutionary government. They completely do not study the correct industrial policy and the direction of the workers' movement repeatedly issued by the CPC Central Committee in the past eleven years since 1937, and they stubbornly resist the party's line. Many local leading organs of the party have not even formally discussed and explained the Central Committee's line for a long time, so that comrades engaged in labor movement work do not understand the Central Committee's line at all. They have reached such a state of numbness, and this situation can no longer continue. All local leading organs of the party must seriously discuss the Central Committee's line and the entire industrial policy and labor movement direction, resolutely correct all leftist adventurist ideas, policies, and methods that harm the working class, the working people, and the revolutionary government, and quickly put industrial construction and the workers' movement on the right track. Only in this way can we gather all our strength to overthrow imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, liberate the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and establish a new democratic China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 坚持职工运动的正确路线  反对“左倾”冒险主义\n\n1948-02-08\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社社论\n\n    坚持职工运动的正确路线\n    反对“左倾”冒险主义\n    中国工人阶级第一次伟大的反对帝国主义走狗军阀的罢工运动，——京汉铁路（即平汉铁路）大罢工，到现在已经整整的二十五年了。二十五年来，中国工人阶级与中国人民年年纪念二月七日这个意义重大的日子，因为京汉铁路大罢工，显示了中国工人阶级的政治觉悟和组织性，显示了工人阶级是中国人民的先进阶级，最革命的阶级。\n    二十五年过去了，“二七”烈士施洋、林祥谦等同志所遗下的事业将要完成，帝国主义与封建势力将要在全中国被扫除。工人阶级、农民、小资产阶级、中等资产阶级、知识分子与其他爱国分子的民主政权，已经在一万万六千万人口的解放区中建立起来，并将要在全国建立起来。“二七”烈士的光荣业迹是永垂不朽的。\n    京汉铁路大罢工，在我国革命的职工运动历史中是光荣的一页。现在的情况，是我国的一部分大城市、铁路、矿山已经解放了，更多的大城市、铁路、矿山将被解放。另一方面，各解放区首先是东北解放区工业和铁路的建设，已在积极进行。此种建设，在今后必须更大规模地进行。因此，解放区职工运动将被提到更加重要的地位。职工运动的方针是否正确，对于革命战争的发展和新民主主义建设的发展，必将发生较之以往更加巨大的影响。我们愿趁着纪念“二七”二十五周年的机会，对于解放区职工运动的方针加以说明。\n    解放区的革命的职工运动与蒋管区的革命的职工运动有同一的总目标，这个总目标，就是争取工人阶级和一切被压迫人民的民主解放，建立新民主主义的中国。但是在同一的总目标之下，革命的职工运动，在两个不同地区的具体方针则是不同的，在许多方面甚至是截然相反的。这是因为在这两个不同的地区里，工人在政治上、社会上的地位和在企业中的地位是不同的，在许多方面是截然相反的。\n    在蒋管区，工人在社会上是最低微的奴隶，他们的劳动，是替帝国主义和官僚资本生产利润；他们的生命，被帝国主义与国民党看的象虫蚁一样不值钱，他们没有人权和自由。在这样悲惨的环境中，工人阶级必须为了活命而作救死求生的斗争；并且为了解放自己与解放一切被压迫的人民起见，必须为推翻帝国主义与大地主大资产阶级的国家政权而斗争，如象“二七”的罢工斗争一样。但是在解放区，工人的政治社会地位，是根本改变和截然不同了。工人与农民、小资产阶级、中等资产阶级、知识分子和其他爱国分子一样，都做了国家和社会的主人翁。工人阶级被一切人民特别尊敬，因为它是先进的阶级，最革命的阶级。在这样的环境中，工人阶级必须拥护自己与人民的民主政治，为争取革命战争的胜利，为新民主主义社会的建设，起先锋带头的领导作用与模范作用。\n    工人在企业中的地位也是不同的。在蒋管区，有官僚资本的企业和民族资本的企业；在官僚资本的企业中，工人的地位是官僚资本家的奴隶。他们救死求生的斗争，常常与反抗统治者的压迫联结起来。在民族资本的企业中，工人受到资本家的剥削，同时又与民族资本家一同受到官僚资本、蒋介石匪帮政府与帝国主义的压迫。他们一方面为了生活，须向资本家提出改善生活的要求，另一方面，为了反抗官僚资本及统治者的压迫，又应与民族资本家联合起来，进行共同斗争。在解放区情形就截然不同了，在解放区的公营企业与合作社经营的企业中，企业的主人是解放了的人民组织起来的政权与合作社，因而在这些企业中的工人，本身就是企业的主人。这里没有剥削者与被剥削者，没有压迫者与被压迫者，因而没有而且不可能有所谓“资方”与“劳方”的对立，所谓“企业主”与非企业主的对立。在解放区的私营企业中，工人有两重地位，一是被剥削者的地位，“劳方”的地位；一是社会主人翁的地位，国家政权的领导者的地位。因为是被剥削者，工人在自己的日常利益上与私人资本家有矛盾；但因为又是社会的主人翁国家政权的领导者，工人便应该为了自己的长远的利益，忍受一定限度的剥削，使这些私人企业能够进行生产，并适当的发展生产，以繁荣解放区的经济，支援前线的胜利，并使新民主主义的社会因生产力的大大提高，而逐步地有依据地发展到将来的社会主义社会方向去。应当知道，新民主主义社会与社会主义社会不同之点，就是在新民主主义社会里，私人资本的企业在生产中还是不可缺少的成份。破坏这部分企业，对于工人阶级和全体人民及其国家政权是非常不利的。正因为如此，工人应当坚决反对那些进行怠工、进行关厂、进行破坏的私人资本家。同时对于愿意继续生产下去的私人资本家则应当与之共同工作，发展生产，繁荣解放区的经济。并在这个基础上，一方面确定保证工人的适当生活，另一方面保证私人资本家的适当利润。这种劳资关系，与在蒋管区所应进行的劳资斗争，是截然不同的。\n    从以上的基本分析里，就可以看到，在蒋管区与解放区，工人在社会上的地位和在企业中的地位，是这样的截然不同。\n    从此，就可以明白解放区的革命的职工运动的方针，为什么要与蒋管区的革命的职工运动的方针截然不同。\n    在蒋管区，革命的职工运动的方针，是用一些方法来保障工作，不致于饿死，和用一切方法来推翻反动政府。在解放区，革命的职工运动，就没有这些任务了。因为在解放区，工人没有饥饿的威胁，反动政府早已推翻。在解放区，革命的职工运动的方针，因此应当彻底改变，改变到耐心的说服工人，来实行毛主席所说的“增加生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的经济政策。\n    应当向工人说明，振兴工业是争取战争胜利的最首要的任务，也是建设新民主主义社会的最首要的任务。而破坏或降低生产是危害解放区的，危害战争胜利的，危害新民主主义社会的建设的，其可怕的程度与蒋介石匪帮的“三光政策”是一样的。\n    应当向工人说明，解放区的工业生产，不是由别人负责，而是由工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党负责的。解放区的农民对农业生产交大量的公粮，服繁重的战争勤务，是尽力负责的。工人应当把工业生产的责任同样负担起来，不但在公营企业与合作社经营的企业里，工人对于生产要担负完完全全的责任，而且在私营企业里，工人对生产也负了大部分责任，虽然私人资本家也要负责。\n    应当向工人说明，工人所以受到解放区人民的尊敬，不是为了别的原因，仅是为了工人阶级在人民中是先进的阶级，最革命的阶级。工人应该以自己对革命的无限忠诚与伟大贡献，来做人民的榜样，领导人民前进。为了争取革命战争的胜利与新民主主义建设的成功，工人应该吃得苦，做得多，应该学习许多模范工人如赵占魁同志等的榜样。在战争的情况下不是做八小时工作，而是做十小时工作。其他劳动条件亦不可定得太高，不可违背经济情况所许可的限度，不可违背发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利的总原则。\n    应当领导工人去学习管理生产，在公营企业与合作社经营的企业中，在厂长的领导下，组织工厂管理委员会，吸收工人代表参加。讨论如何减轻成本，提高生产的数量和质量，如何解决与改善由购进原料，制造成品，与推销成品过程中的各种复杂问题。这种管理方法，亦可在私人企业中，说服私人资本家试办。在私人企业的管理委员会中，除了讨论上述问题外，并可规定私人资本家一定的利润和工人的一定的待遇，以实现劳资两利。\n    毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”中指出：“对于小资产阶级及中等资产阶级经济成份，采取过左的错误政策，如象我们党在一九三一年至一九三四年期间所犯过的那样“过高的劳动条件，过高的所得税率，在土地改革中侵犯工商业者，不以发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利为目标，而以近视的、片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标”是绝对不许可的。这种错误，如果重犯，必然要损害劳动群众的利益及新民主主义国家的利益”。毛主席这个指示，对于解放区职工运动是非常重要的。职工运动的领导者们，绝对不许可以近视的、片面的、所谓劳动者福利为目标，提出过高的劳动条件。解放区职工运动的方针，应当严格的符合于新民主主义的经济政策，这就是发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利。一切与此符合的应该发展，一切与此违背的应当改正过来。\n    必须指出，直到现在，中国共产党内，还有不少的党员，不少的干部，不少的工会工作人员，甚至有不少的担负高级领导地位的领导人员，并不了解党的工业政策与职工运动的路线。他们只看见树木，不看见森林。他们只知道片面的，狭隘的，近视的所谓“工人利益”，而不能稍微看远一点。他们忘记了一九三一至一九三四年时期内，实行过的那种左倾冒险主义的工业政策与职工运动路线，曾经给予工人阶级、劳动人民与革命政府以何等重大的损害。他们完全不研究一九三七年以来，十一年内中共中央历次发布的正确的工业政策与职工运动方针，他们固执地抵抗党的路线。许多党的地方领导机关，在长时期内，甚至没有正式讨论与宣传解释过中央的路线，以致于使得工运工作同志完全不了解中央的路线，他们竟达到如此麻木不仁的地步，这种情况，再也不能继续下去了。党的一切地方领导机关，必须严肃地讨论中央的路线，及全部工业政策与工运方针，坚决地纠正一切危害工人阶级、劳动人民及革命政府的左倾冒险主义的思想、政策与办法，迅速地使工业建设与工人运动走入正轨。只有这样，我们才能聚积一切力量，打倒帝国主义与国民党反动统治，解放中华民族与中国人民，建立新民主主义的中国。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: Rome dispatch: The Italian People's Democratic Front movement is unfolding a magnificent array throughout the country. According to figures announced by the Front's organizing committee, dozens of political parties and mass organizations have joined the People's Democratic Front. In January alone, the Front held meetings in dozens of locations across Italy and established a fund committee. People's Front branch offices have been established in many central areas, including Milan, Turin, Brescia, Bolzano, Genoa, @拉拉 in northern Italy; Rome, Florence, Perugia, Pisa, Ancona in central Italy; and Bari in southern Italy. The National Labor Youth Conference, scheduled to convene in Genoa on the 8th of this month, is being actively prepared. A new movement called \"Garibaldi's Vanguard\" has been launched among young people in central and southern Italy, uniting them in the struggle for fundamental social reforms. \"Garibaldi's Vanguard\" has already held youth conferences in nineteen cities, including Rome, and elected delegates to attend the National Youth Conference. \"Garibaldi's Women\" teams have also been formed in several regions of the country, forming the basis for the \"People's Democratic Front Women's Association.\" The 26th National Congress of the Italian Socialist Party recently called on demobilized former guerrillas to join the People's Democratic Front. The Farmers' Assembly, one of the Front's participants, is guiding agricultural workers and farmers in the struggle for land. Workers' Management Production Committees are particularly active in northern Italy, fighting to defend national industry against the destruction of local industries by monopolistic capitalists under the Marshall Plan. The committees have already taken over the Ancona shipyard and the oil refineries in the Po River basin that were shut down by reactionary capitalists, as well as several factories in Bologna and Milan. The \"Christians for Peace Movement,\" which has joined the People's Democratic Front, is expanding among Catholic working people. Many important figures in the Republican Party and many of its local organizations, refusing to follow the policy of cooperation with the Gasperi police government advocated by party leader Pacciardi, have left the party and joined the People's Democratic Front. The leadership of the Labour Democratic Party and its parliamentary group stood with the People's Democratic Front from the very beginning.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: TASS Rome dispatch: The first National Congress of the Italian People's Democratic Front passed the Front's charter on the 1st. The main points are as follows: The People's Democratic Front unites all Italians who desire peace, labor, freedom, and national independence. It takes concrete measures to restore the country and civilized progress under the legal order of the republic and conditions of domestic and international peace. It carries out reforms of administrative institutions as stipulated by the fundamental principles of the constitution, guaranteeing the safety of all working people, the unemployed, those who have suffered from war, and veterans. The charter specifically stipulates: In agriculture: providing technical and financial assistance to small and medium-sized landowners, farmers, and cooperatives; reducing taxes on small and medium-sized landowners; confiscating the property of large landowners; and revising contracts for the use of land. In industry: recognizing \"Workers' Management Factory Committees,\" eliminating bureaucratic interference, nationalizing large monopoly industries, and protecting small and medium-sized enterprises. In the recovery of southern Italy: implementing soil improvement in conjunction with land reform, guaranteeing democratic development, and formulating laws for the construction of public works. In state institutions: reforming administrative institutions, the military, and the police to achieve effective democratization, with the people managing the use of the state's main economic resources and administrative organs. Implementing local autonomy and reforming finance. In culture: opening schools for the people and developing research and scientific activities. People have the freedom to participate in all cultural activities and control the sources of funding for broadcasting, information, and newspapers. The charter also stipulates the protection of the rights of women and youth. The charter also stipulates the establishment of friendly cooperation and extensive barter policies with peace-loving and free countries. Abolishing monopolies on the purchase or sale of markets, protecting national sovereignty and independence, and never acting as a tool or battlefield in struggles contrary to the free world. The charter concludes by pointing out the methods to achieve the above goals: \"Unite all forces in the working people who care about the fate of the country, freedom and labor. The working people should now stand at the forefront of the national salvation cause to overcome the selfish resistance of organized reactionary groups to maintain their privileges and to guarantee that the people's election promises are fulfilled.\" The charter points out: Defending the republic and democratic institutions cannot be left to the ruling class to dispose of freely. The ruling class is now mired in chaos and turmoil. The charter emphatically states: Loyalty to the charter is a reliable guarantee for achieving national unity, order, and welfare.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: Rome dispatch: L'Unità, the newspaper of the Italian Communist Party, commented on the first National Congress of the Italian People's Democratic Front, stating: \"The People's Democratic Front is a long-term alliance of the progressive forces of the people.\" It pointed out: \"For eight months, the people have not evaded the struggle; they have launched appropriate counterattacks against the enemy. The People's Democratic Front has been formed in this struggle, which is a manifestation of the unity that the Italian people demand. Now that the People's Democratic Front has been born, it will unite all those who are unwilling to submit to reactionary rule and organize and lead millions of Italian people in a counter-offensive.\" L'Unità concluded emphatically: \"The struggles of the past eight months prove that the Italian people cannot be intimidated or suppressed. The emergence of the People's Democratic Front and its entry into battle prove that the people's power can not only organize resistance but also has the ability to launch a counter-offensive.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 意人民阵线阵容雄壮  首次全国大会通过人民宪章  它将领导千百万人民进行反攻\n\n1948-02-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    意人民阵线阵容雄壮\n    首次全国大会通过人民宪章\n    它将领导千百万人民进行反攻\n    【新华社陕北六日电】罗马讯：意大利人民民主阵线运动正在全国展开雄壮的阵容。据该阵线组织委员会宣布的数字，已有几十个政党和群众团体参加人民民主阵线。仅在一月间，该阵线曾在全意数十个地方举行会议，并设立基金委员会。意大利北部的米兰、都灵、布里西亚、波尔撒诺、热那亚、＠拉拉；中部的罗马、佛罗伦萨、培芦查、彼萨、安科纳，以及南部的巴利等很多中心地区，均设有人民阵线各省分会。行将在本月八日于热那亚召开的全国劳动青年会议，正热烈筹备中。意中南部各地已发起在青年中开展“加黎波的先锋”的新运动，借以团结青年进行争取社会基本改革的斗争。“加黎波的先锋”现已在罗马等十九个城市举行青年大会，选出出席全国青年会议的代表。“加黎波的妇女”队也在国内若干地区组成，并以之为基础而成立“人民民主阵线妇女协会”。意社会党二十六届全国代表大会最近号召已退伍的前游击队员参加人民民主阵线。该阵线参加者之一农民大会，正指导农业工人及农民进行争取土地的斗争。工人管理生产委员会在北意特别活跃，进行保卫民族工业反对独占资本家按马歇尔计划摧毁本国工业的斗争。该委员会已接管了安科纳的造船厂和波河流域被反动资本家倒闭的炼油厂，以及波隆那及米兰的若干工厂。已加入人民民主阵线的“基督徒争取和平运动”，正在天主教劳动人民中间扩大着。共和党的许多重要人物及该党很多地方组织，拒绝遵行该党领袖蒲希亚地与加斯贝利警察政府实行合作的方针，纷纷脱离该党，参加了人民民主阵线。劳工民主党领导机关及其国会党团，则一开始就站到人民民主阵线方面来。\n    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社罗马讯：意人民民主阵线首次全国大会，于一日通过该阵线宪章。其要点如下：人民民主阵线团结意大利一切希望和平、劳动、自由及国家独立的人民。采取具体措施，在共和国合法秩序及国内外和平条件下，以恢复国家及文明进步。进行宪法基本原则所规定的行政机构的改革，保障一切劳动人民、失业者、曾遭受战祸者及退伍军人的安全。宪章具体规定：在农业方面：以技术和财政援助中小土地所有者、农民和合作社，减轻中小土地所有者的税额，没收大地主的财产，修改使用土地的契约。在工业方面：承认“工人管理工厂委员会”，取消官僚干涉、实行大独占工业国有化及保护中小企业等。在恢复意南部方面：实行改良土壤配合土地改革，保证民主发展和制订建设公共工程的法律等。在国家机构方面：改革行政机构、军队和警察，以实现有效的民主化，由人民管理国家主要经济资源的使用及行政机关。实行地方机关自治并改革财政。文化方面：为人民开办学校，发展研究和科学活动。人民有自由参加一切文化活动及对广播、情报及报章资金来源的管制权。宪章也规定了保护妇女及青年的权利。宪章并规定与爱好和平及自由的国家建立友谊合作及广泛的换货政策。废除购买或销售市场的独占，保护国家主权及独立，决不作与自由世界背道而驰的斗争中的工具或战场。宪章最后在规定达到以上目标的方法时指出：“团结一切关心国家命运、自由和劳动人民中的一切力量。劳动人民现在应该在救国事业中站到最前列来，以克服有组织的反动集团为保持其特权而作的自私自利的抵抗，并使人民得到履行选举诺言的保证。”宪章指出：保卫共和及民主机构，决不能由统治阶级自由处置。统治阶级现正陷于紊乱与纷扰之中。宪章力称：忠实于宪章，是达到国家统一、秩序和福利的可靠保证。\n    【新华社陕北六日电】罗马讯：意共团结报顷评意大利人民民主阵线第一次全国大会称：“人民民主阵线是人民进步力量的长期联盟”。指出：“八个月来，人民没有逃避斗争，他们向敌人进行了适当的反击，人民民主阵线就是在这种斗争中形成起来的，这是意国人民所要求的团结的表现。现在人民民主阵线已经诞生，它将要把一切不愿屈服于反动统治下的人们团结起来，并组织和领导千百万意大利人民进行反攻”。团结报结语力称：“过去八个月的斗争，证明意大利人民是恫吓不倒也是镇压不了的。人民民主阵线的出现并进入战斗，证明人民的力量不仅能组织抵抗，而且有能力进而发动反攻”。"

The military and civilians in the Jinzhong plains are launching a broad, mass-based political offensive towards the heartland controlled by the Yan bandits. On the night of January 6th, over 300 military personnel and civilians from the Yangqu and Jiaocheng border areas entered the vicinity of a key stronghold of the Yan bandits via multiple routes, convening mass meetings in over twenty villages. They publicized the counter-offensive situation of our army, boosted the people's confidence in victory, and left a warning for the Yan bandit \"shock troops\" (landlord armed forces): \"If you continue to do bad things, we will resolutely suppress you.\" Several days later, seven soldiers escaped from strongholds such as Matoushui, while the \"shock troops\" bandits were terrified. On the 19th, the Qing(yuan)-Tai(yuan) work team suddenly entered villages surrounding a key stronghold of the Yan bandits in Qingyuan, distributed propaganda materials, liberated more than 40 women who had been forced to \"confess and be reborn,\" and killed Yue Tongsu, the captain of the \"Revenge Brigade\" in Beiying.

Yudin, editor of the Soviet Labor Newspaper and vice-chairman of the International Association of Journalists, serves as the editor-in-chief. The editorial committee includes ten people, including Biro, Buican, Weidacher-Pisaka, Jengis, Gorsitz, Grigorenko, and Sigtel. This issue contains a special article by Marinin denouncing the Marshall Plan, stating that American reactionaries have never relied on their fifth column in Europe (from neo-fascists De Gaulle and Gasperi to Blum, Saragat, Edley, and Bevin) to do evil as they do now. The reason is that the Marshall Plan has encountered resistance at home and abroad and is clearly facing difficulties.

In Xiaozhan, we distributed a total of over six hundred and forty shi of grain—belonging to the four major landlords including Guo Demao, the puppet regular regiment battalion commander, and the grain seized from the enemy—along with the equipment from the puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Farmland Bureau, etc., to the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 渤海我军配合晋察冀破击战  歼匪千余拔据点多处\n\n1948-02-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    渤海我军配合晋察冀破击战\n    歼匪千余拔据点多处\n    【新华社华东六日电】渤海我军配合晋察冀解放军对蒋匪内战动脉平汉、津浦、北宁、平绥路的破击战，自上月八日迄十九日，战果如下：拔除蒋伪据点小站、碱水沾、下葛沽等二十余处，解放村镇二百余，人口十余万。活捉蒋伪大队长曹曼生以下七百余名，毙伤三百余名，高洪基大队全部就歼，共缴获大小炮二十余门，轻重机枪二十九挺，长短枪六百余支，汽车三辆，各种枪炮弹七百余发，骡马百余匹，并破坏静海南北铁路二十余里，严重打击了平津保三角地带的蒋傅匪，迫使其退守天津。我军在炮火声中开仓济贫，于小站将伪常备团大队长郭德茂等四家大地主之粮食及缴获敌人的粮食共六百四十余石，和伪农林部农田局等机关用具分给群众。"

    "content": "Celebrating the New Year in Shijiazhuang\n    Zhang Shen, Hong Qun, Shi Ji\n    Early in the morning, as the sun was just rising in the east, the sounds of gongs and drums drifted from afar. At the west entrance of Xinhua Road, groups of men, women, and children, radiating boundless joy, hurried into the main street. As reporters entered the street, the road was already filled with people. At a large gate on the north side, the railway workers' militia's Yangko team was just emerging. In a hutong to the south, newspaper vendor Old Wang was briskly striding into a doorway, with only two newspapers left in his hand. On the usually bustling Jiefang (Liberation) Street, the two-li long, three- or four-zhang wide thoroughfare was already seething with activity, a sea of heads moving, the sounds of gongs and drums shaking the heavens. Bicycles were impossible to ride, and even pushing them was difficult. Every traffic policeman's platform was crowded with people. These umbrella-shaped platforms, which pedestrians previously dared not approach, had now become human towers. Soldiers dancing the Yangko, the Da Xing Textile Factory workers' stilt walkers and Yangko team, the Ba Wang Bian (King's Whip) performance of the textile factory workers' children's school, the martial arts of the Acrobatics Association, variety shows... five or six performances filled the street. People in red and green shirts danced, sang, twisted, and laughed in the middle, while the crowds watching clapped, joyfully chatted, and the joyous sounds of thousands of people merged into a grand symphony! On the tall buildings lining both sides of the street, every window leaf and rooftop was packed with shop assistants in long gowns and melon-cap hats, bosses, old people, children, and the countless eyes of women. Photography reporters also climbed onto the roofs to quickly adjust their lenses. Every fork of every roadside tree was climbed by children, stacked like acrobats, opening their little mouths, craning their necks, shouting and laughing. The facades of every store on both sides of the street were also particularly bright compared to usual. Many newly opened stores had newly painted signs hanging high, with brightly colored goods displayed in dazzling glass windows and on the edges of counters. Inside the North China Bookstore, portraits of great people, art charts, various paintings and calligraphy... attracted the flowing crowds. In front of the North China Xinhua Bookstore, a brand-new national flag fluttered in the wind, and a sign at the entrance advertised \"Big Sale for Seven Days, All Items 20% Off.\" Many shops had new couplets posted. In front of the Municipal Government, a tall archway made of cypress branches inlaid with various colored light bulbs was erected, with a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging high in the center. On the gate were huge, bright red couplets: \"Build Shijiazhuang, Protect Industry and Commerce.\" An old gentleman in the crowd at the entrance looked up in quiet observation. Next door, at the People's Education Center, people squeezed in and out, vying to see the comic strip paintings, news photos, and the list of war trophies from the self-defense war on the four walls inside. Under a painting of peasants excavating a landlord's hidden hoard, an old woman and two women were talking as they watched. A young textile factory worker immediately read the explanation under the painting to them. The old woman said, \"Serves him right, hoarding the money of the poor! It should be dug up and distributed to the poor!\" In front of a barbershop opposite the People's Education Center, four merchants stood side by side on the steps. When reporters asked them if the New Year under the rule of the Chiang bandits last year was lively, they vied to say, \"There were performances, but all those putting on the performances were soldiers. It wasn't like this now, with the workers happily dancing and singing. Back then, workers weren't given any recognition. And those watching couldn't just casually approach. If you got too close, you'd get hit with a stick or sprayed with cold water!\"\n    Right at the eastern end of this bustling Zhongshan Road, in front of the Fountain Pool, two oil paintings, each over a zhang tall, of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, stood side by side, overlooking the countless laughing and shouting people in the city. From the bottom of everyone's heart, they cheered and silently praised the people's leader, Chairman Mao!\n    Right in front of these portraits, the Yangko team of the United University Art Troupe was surrounded by a circle of ten thousand people. To the south and north, forty or fifty bicycles were piled together, with people standing on top of them. The large Yangko performance of over thirty people, the flower drum performance of a man and a woman, the victory drum performance of over twenty people, the cheerful, magnificent, and confident melodies, the clear words, accompanied by the soaring accompaniment, and the rhythmic drumbeats, stirred the emotions of every spectator, causing them to boil over.\n    The Yangko team of the United University Art Troupe turned to Nanma Road, and the crowd followed to Nanma Road. Here, a large number of small vendors, hearing the sound of the drums approaching, quickly packed up their stalls. As the red flag of the Yangko team moved forward on the road, countless spectators in the southwest ran and sat down in a large circle, erupting in thunderous applause.\n    The music from the recently opened Dan Gui Theater to the east echoed the festivities. The head of the Innovation Theater Troupe told reporters: Today, they sold two hundred more tickets than usual, and they are also preparing to perform the newly staged \"Forced to Join Liangshan\" to comfort the troops.\n    Passing through Huayuan Street, the crowds surged and vendors were busy. A large wine vat was marked with a red paper advertisement: \"Celebrating the New Year, Big Blowout Sale.\" The couplet on one shop was: \"The shop owner is amiable and business is good, Democratic construction of Shijiazhuang.\" In a hutong, the doorway of a former head of a poverty relief group was adorned with the couplet: \"Work together to build a revolutionary home, Only collective production can improve life.\" Not far from this house, a five- or six-year-old girl was holding a piece of pork, and two other children with her told me: \"It's New Year's! We're going to eat something good at home, Dad just bought it.\" Walking from here onto a small street that led to Zhongshan Road, it was relatively quiet. A small vendor sat quietly in the sunlight next to the street, looking at the Chairman Mao's report printed in red in this newspaper. He said: \"What the Chairman said about dividing the land equally and reorganizing the troops is really good!\" As he finished speaking, he continued to examine a section about the issues of industry and commerce.\n    In the southwest, a burst of gongs and drums, along with the noise of the crowd, turned into the west entrance of Zhongshan Road again.\n    The noises from all directions continued to sound, the flow of people was in motion, and Shijiazhuang was moving forward.\n    (Reprinted from Shijiazhuang Daily)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石家庄过新年\n张深  洪群  石基\n1948-02-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    石家庄过新年\n    张深  洪群  石基\n    清早，太阳刚从东方升起，锣鼓声远远传来。新华路西口，一群一群的男女小孩洋溢着无限的欢快，匆忙的赶进大街。当记者走入街口，人已经填满了马路，路北一个大门口，铁路工人纠察队的秧歌队刚走出来，南面胡同里，报贩王老头急急的迈进一家门口。他拿的报纸已只剩下了两份。在平日最热闹的解放大街，那二里多长三、四丈宽的大街已经沸腾起来了，万头钻动，锣鼓震天。脚踏车没法骑，推着也难挤动，每个交通警的岗台上都站满了人，这以前行人不敢接近的伞状的岗台如今都变成了一座座的人塔。战士跳的秧歌舞，大兴纱厂工人的高跷、秧歌队，纱厂职工子弟学校的霸王鞭，杂技联合会的武术，杂耍……五、六起玩艺排满街道，穿着红绿衫衣的人们在中间跳着、唱着、扭着、笑着，看的人群阵阵的鼓掌、欢悦的说笑、千万个人的快乐的声音汇成一股宏大交响巨流！街两旁重叠的高楼上，每个楼窗的合叶和楼的顶端都挤满了长衫瓜帽的店员、老板和老人、小孩、妇女的千万只眼睛。摄影记者也爬上楼顶迅速的拨转镜头，路旁每棵道树的槎叉都爬上了小孩子，象叠罗汉一样，用各种各样的姿态，张开小嘴，伸着脖子，嚷着笑着。大街两边各个商店的门面也比往日特别鲜亮，很多新开的店铺门口都高挂新漆的招牌，鲜艳的货品陈列在耀眼的玻璃橱里和台柜前缘。北新书局的门面内，伟人像、美术图表、各种书画……，吸引着流动的人们，华北新华书店的楼前，崭新的国旗迎风摆动，门口贴着“大减价七天，一律八折”的广告。许多店铺都贴出新联，在市政府门口，扎起高大镶着各色灯泡的柏枝牌楼，毛主席的画像高悬正中，大门上贴着鲜红的巨幅：“建设石家庄，保护工商业”的新联，门口人群里，一位老先生仰头静观。隔壁的民众教育馆，人们挤进挤出，争看室内四壁的连环彩画、新闻照片和自卫战争的缴获表。在一幅农民发掘地主窖藏的画下，一位老太太和两个妇人边看边说，旁边一个纱厂青工马上给他们念了画下的说明，老太太说道：“真该，看他闹的穷人的钱藏起来，该刨出来分给穷人！”在民教馆对面的一家理发馆门前，四个商人并列在台阶上，记者问到他们去年的今天，蒋匪统治的年节是否热闹，他们争着说：“也有玩艺，但是，闹玩艺的全是军人，没有现在这样，工人们高兴的扭唱，那时候不提高工人啊，看的人也不能这么随便，一靠前就被棍子打和冷水喷！”\n    就在这热闹的中山路的东尽头，喷水池的前面，两幅丈多高的毛主席和朱总司令的油画新像并列着，在俯视着这个城市里万千个欢笑叫闹人众的行列，从每个人的心底，欢呼着、默颂着人民的领袖毛主席啊！\n    就在这像的前面，联大文工团的秧歌队被围成了一个万人的大圈子，南边和北边，四、五十辆自行车扔到一堆，车子上面也都站起了人，三十多人的大秧歌，男女两人的打花鼓，二十多人的胜利摇鼓，愉快的、雄壮的、自信的曲调，清晰的字音，配着高扬的伴奏乐律，整齐的咚咚的鼓声，把每个观众的心情，鼓舞得滚沸起来。\n    联大文工团的秧歌队转到南马路，人群也跟到南马路。这里，一大片小摊贩刚听到鼓声近来就赶紧收拾起了货摊，秧歌队的红旗还在马路上前进的时候，西南面无数的观众就飞跑围坐成一个大圈，掀起了雷动的掌声。\n    东面新开张不久的丹桂剧院的乐声呼应着，革新剧社的负责人告诉记者：今天多卖了二百多张票，晚上还准备演出新排的“逼上梁山”慰劳部队。\n    行经花园街时，人群挤动，摊贩忙碌，一个卖酒的大篓上标志着“庆祝新年大甩卖”的红纸广告，一家店铺的对联是：“店东两和买卖好，民主建设石家庄”。在一条胡同里，一个前些日当过贫民小组长的家门口，贴着“一齐劳动建设革命家务，大家生产才能改善生活”的对联。离这家不远，一个五、六岁的小姑娘怀里抱着一块猪肉，和她在一起的两个小孩告诉我说：“过年啦！家里要吃好的，爹才买回的”，从这里往中山路上走过的一条小街，比较清静，街旁一个小摊贩静坐在阳光下看着红色印就的本报所刊毛主席报告，他说：“主席说的这平分土地和整顿队伍真好！”这时，说罢他又在细看着关于工商业问题的一段。\n    西南边，一阵锣鼓和着人群的噪杂声又转进中山路的西口来了。\n    四面八方的喧闹声仍在响动，人流在旋转、石家庄在行进。\n    （转载石家庄日报）"

Returning the machine to its original owner is not enough; now they have also made a profound self-criticism. This spirit of self-criticism is very worthy of our learning. This incident proves that the Chinese Communist Party's policy of protecting industry and commerce is not only a real policy but also a unified policy of the entire Party. Chairman Mao made profound instructions on this policy in his report 'The Present Situation and Our Tasks.' We must act according to these instructions. Whoever violates these instructions is making a mistake and must correct it. Criticism and self-criticism are the most effective methods for correcting mistakes, especially when the people in newly liberated cities do not understand, or do not fully understand, the policies of our Communist Party, and are afraid to openly criticize our mistakes. We should even more learn from the example of the comrades of the Ji'nan Daily, dare to openly criticize ourselves.\" The short commentary continued: \"When we published the news about Zhongxing Stationery Store, the main purpose was not to criticize the comrades of the Ji'nan Daily, but the Propaganda Department of the Jin-Hebei-Luyu Central Bureau, based on this news, issued a notice asking the Ji'nan Daily and propaganda organs at all levels to conduct investigations. After the investigation, the comrades of the Ji'nan Daily conducted self-criticism. We are willing to learn from this style, contribute more space to everyone, and hope that everyone will use it to pay attention to listening to the opinions of the masses at all times, be brave in criticizing others, and be brave in criticizing ourselves, strengthen the combat effectiveness of our newspaper, strengthen our connection with the people of the city, and promote the work of the city.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石门日报短论号召  学习冀南日报自我批评精神\n\n1948-02-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    石门日报短论号召\n    学习冀南日报自我批评精神\n    【本报消息】冀南日报社在石门贱买印刷机的检讨在本报发表后，石门日报除将主要内容加以刊载外，并发表短论称：“冀南日报的同志，在本市中兴文具店贱买了一部铅印机，这件事情做错了，机器退回原主还不算，现在又作了深刻的自我批评。这种自我批评精神很值得我们学习。这件事情，证明中国共产党保护工商业的政策，不但是真实的政策，而且是全党统一的政策。毛主席在‘目前形势和我们的任务’的报告里，对这个政策作了深刻的指示，我们一定要照这个指示办事，谁违背这个指示，就是犯了错误，就必须改正。批评和自我批评是改正错误的最有效的方法，特别是新解放城市的人民，对我们共产党的政策还不了解，或不完全了解，还不敢公开地批评我们的错误的时候，我们更应当学习冀南日报同志们的榜样，敢于公开地批评自己。”短论继称：“我们发表中兴文具店的消息的时候，主要的还不在批评冀南日报社的同志，但晋冀鲁豫中央局宣传部根据这条消息，就发出通告，要冀南日报和各级宣传机关进行检查，冀南日报的同志们在检查之后，进行了自我批评。我们愿意向这种作风学习，贡献更多的篇幅给大家，希望大家利用它，时刻注意倾听群众的意见，勇于批评别人，并勇于批评自己，加强我们报纸的战斗性，密切我们与全市人民的联系，推进全市的工作。”"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "The Myth of \"Auspicious Light\"\n\nIn our examination of newspaper \"fillers,\" we have already discovered instances of writing about living people as dead, and also of writing about dead people as alive. This shameful fabrication is not limited to the border region; it exists elsewhere as well.\n\nRecently, I came across a booklet published by Shandong Bookstore, containing an article written by someone under the pseudonym \"Auspicious Light.\" The article claimed that Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the CCP Central Committee, wrote a letter to his family, urging them to hand over their land to the masses, stating that this was \"the trend of the times.\" It further stated that Comrade Kang Sheng had a younger brother who went back to persuade Kang Sheng's father to hand over the land to the masses, but Kang Sheng's father, with \"a twirl of his moustache,\" scolded him roundly. Later, Kang Sheng's younger brother organized the masses for a reckoning, and only then was the land distributed to the masses. This article has been reprinted in magazines and newspapers published in various parts of our border region.\n\nThis news was written with great \"specificity,\" but unfortunately, it is a complete fabrication out of thin air. According to those familiar with Comrade Kang Sheng's situation, Comrade Kang Sheng has not had any contact with his family for over twenty years. Kang Sheng's father has also been dead for over twenty years, and his mother has been dead for forty years. He also does not have a younger brother. However, this \"Auspicious Light\" of a \"filler\" illuminates the dead back to life, and even sees his \"twirled moustache.\" It even creates a younger brother for Comrade Kang Sheng.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 6th: In the past month, local armed forces in Central China, combined with the broad masses of the people, have crushed the dying \"sweep\" of Chiang bandit's twelve regiments, annihilating more than 6,000 enemies. The details are as follows: Since the Ye Ting South Campaign (December 26th to 29th last year), Chiang bandit in Central China still attempted to struggle desperately, drawing together forces defending various transportation lines and important towns, totaling twelve regiments, to carry out a \"sweep.\" Successively, ten regiments from the 4th Division, 51st Division, 21st Division, and 23rd Division, etc., invaded Dongtai in Central Jiangsu, one regiment from the 44th Division invaded Donghai and Guanyun in Northern Jiangsu, and the 1563rd Regiment of the 88th Brigade invaded Sixian in Northern Anhui, etc. During the \"sweep,\" Chiang bandit used a policy of destruction. Most of the larger towns in Dongtai were burned down. More than 1,000 households in the famous seaport @ Port were burned, leaving only 35 households. Along the coastal grassland, from Kushuiyang to Tongshangzhen, 60% of more than 40 li was burned into scorched earth. In western Guanyun, Northern Jiangsu, 60,000 people were robbed of 350,000 jin of grain, 210,000 jin of burning grass, and more than 1,530 cattle, donkeys, pigs, and sheep. However, it also exposed the weaknesses of Chiang bandit. The enemy in the \"sweep\" crawled at a snail's pace. For example, it took a whole day to crawl only ten li from Shizong to Sanzu. Local armed forces in various places combined with the broad masses of the people to bravely persist in the counter-\"sweep.\" Chiang bandit in Dongtai was blocked and suffered more than 40 casualties by the local militia and guerrillas. Local armed forces on the outer lines launched an all-out attack on the enemy's transportation lines and important strongholds. On the first day of January, the local armed forces of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong fought and successively拔(ba) [removed] the strongholds of Nanyang Village, Dong'an Town, etc., on the periphery of Qidong. On the 16th, they fought again near Shigang in Nantong, and on the 23rd, they fought for the third time on the Rugao-Juegang line, capturing the important town of Chahe. On the 26th, they also took the important town of Shigang in Nantong. The local armed forces in Haian and southern Taizhou counties also launched four annihilation battles in less than 20 days (from New Year's Day to the 18th), capturing the important town of Shizhuang in Rugao on the banks of the Yangtze River, and annihilating the enemy near the suburbs of Xuanjiabao in Taixing, near Baimi in Taizhou, near Huangqiao, and other places. The local armed forces in the Huaihai area of Northern Jiangsu harassed the side of the Longhai Railway and captured Lugou, north of Suqian, and other places. The local armed forces in Northern Anhui also advanced to Lingbi and Suxian on the east side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, capturing Gaoji, Chantang, and other places, and sweeping away the local bandits scattered in the countryside. Another unit of the local armed forces also removed enemy strongholds such as Shuangcaiwei on the Si (Xian)-Su (Qian) highway. The local armed forces in various places fought more and more fiercely. The local armed forces in the Ninth Military Subdistrict successively captured Chahe and Shigang in five days, annihilating more than 2,400 enemies. The local armed forces in Taixing also annihilated entire battalions of the enemy's regular army, creating a model for the local armed forces in Central China to fight independently for more than a year. In total, more than 6,000 enemies were annihilated in January alone, and more than 30 enemy strongholds of various sizes were captured. By this point, Chiang bandit's dying \"sweep\" was completely crushed by us. In the counter-\"sweep,\" the masses in various places also cooperated with the local armed forces in combat. The masses in a certain village established a counter-\"sweep\" command, organized reconnaissance teams, communication teams, and custody teams (to control local bullies and landlords) to lead the masses in burying supplies, and to deal with the enemy, so that when Chiang bandit came, not a single person, a single carrying pole, or a single rope would be left behind, making it impossible for Chiang bandit to stay in the village. The masses in Zhangxinzhuang, Gaojintang, and other villages in Guanyun used sickles and iron forks to repel more than 500 local Chiang bandits who were looting grain.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 粉碎蒋匪十二个团“扫荡”  华中上月歼敌六千\n\n1948-02-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    粉碎蒋匪十二个团“扫荡”\n    华中上月歼敌六千\n    【新华社华东六日电】最近一月来华中地方武装结合广大人民，粉碎蒋匪十二个团的垂死“扫荡”，歼敌六千余人。经过如下：自叶（挺）南战役（去年十二月二十六至二十九）后，华中蒋匪仍图垂死挣扎，抽集防守各交通干线及重要城镇之兵力共十二个团进行“扫荡”，先后以四师、五一师、二一师及二三师等部十个团，犯苏中之东台，以四四师一个团犯苏北之东海、灌云，以八八旅一五六三团犯淮北之泗县等地。“扫荡”中蒋匪使用毁灭政策，东台较大市镇大都被烧光，有名海港＠港一千多户被烧，仅剩三十五户。沿海草原从苦水洋到通商镇，四十余里有十分之六被烧成一片焦土。苏北灌云西部六万人民即被抢去三十五万斤粮食，二十一万斤烧草，和牛驴猪羊一千五百三十多只。但同时也暴露了蒋匪的弱点，“扫荡”之敌，均龟步爬行，如由十总到三组仅十里路就爬了一整天。我各地地方武装则结合广大人民英勇坚持反“扫荡”，东台之蒋匪为该地民兵游击队阻击，杀伤四十余人。外线地方武装全面出击敌之交通线和重要据点，南通、如（皋）东、海门、启东地武于一月初一战，连拔启东外围南阳村、东安镇等据点。十六日再战于南通石港附近，二十三日三战于如（皋）掘（港）线上，攻克岔河重镇。二十六日又拿下南通重镇石港。海安、泰州县南地武，也在不到二十天（元旦至十八日）中连打四次歼灭战，攻下长江边上如皋之石庄重镇，并在泰兴之宣家堡近郊及泰州白米附近、黄桥近郊等地歼敌。苏北淮海地武捣陇海路侧，攻克宿迁北之陆沟等地。淮北地武也挺进津浦路东侧之灵壁、宿县攻克高集、禅堂等地，并扫荡散处乡村之土杂。地武另部又于泗（县）、宿（迁）公路上拔除双蔡圩等敌据点。各地地武越打越猛，九分区地武五天中连克岔河、石港，歼敌二千四百多，泰兴地武也整营的歼敌正规军，创造了华中地武年余以来单独作战的范例。总计一月份一个月中歼敌六千余名，克大小敌据点三十余处。至此，蒋匪的垂死“扫荡”即为我全部粉碎。在反“扫荡”中各地群众亦配合地武作战，某村群众成立反“扫荡”指挥部，组织侦察班、通讯班、看押班（管制恶霸地主）领导群众埋藏物资，并与敌周旋，做到蒋匪来时不留一个人、一根扁担和一条绳子，使蒋匪进村后无法停留。灌云张新庄、高金塘等村群众以镰刀铁叉打退了五百多个抢粮的土蒋匪。"

On December 15th, this unit of bandit troops forced fifty-four disabled soldiers to cross the river eastward to their deaths (i.e., the north bank of the Yellow River at Fenglingdu). At the time, many soldiers burst into tears as they boarded the ship, saying, \"Officials! You might as well shoot us all with machine guns, to save us from freezing to death in the Yellow River.\" Amidst the chaotic cries, the Chiang bandits brought in a company to escort them by boat, forcing them onto the boat. Upon reaching the Dajia shoal in the middle of the river, they drove these soldiers off the boat and returned. This shoal was in the middle of the river, with high water on both sides, and it was the middle of the night. Everyone cried and screamed, and they had no choice but to wade into the water and escape to the east bank, our side. By the time they reached the shore, nine had already frozen to death or been swept away. The rest were rescued and saved by our river defense troops.

    "content": "Xiangyuan Chengguan District Cadres\n    Visit Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers to Propagandize the Land Law\n    [Xiangyuan News] On the 25th of last month, the Chengguan District of Xiangyuan, after reading the short commentary \"Go to Poor Peasants and Hired Laborers to Propagandize the Land Law\" published in the People's Daily on the 22nd, held a meeting of district cadres on the 26th to study and decided to visit poor peasants and hired laborers door-to-door to understand the situation and propagandize the Land Law. Comrade Sun Laicheng, chairman of the district trade union, went to Xiguan and first met with the cadres to talk about the propaganda of the Land Law in the village and the reflections of the masses, as well as the production and living conditions of the poor peasants and hired laborers. Street chief Zhang Jinsheng said: \"The Land Law in our street has been read in the people's school, and the masses have responded well. The emancipation of the poor peasants and hired laborers in our street is almost complete. There are no most or least, and everyone has enough to eat now. There are no beggars.\" Later, Comrade Sun was introduced by the cadres to three poor peasants to talk with them. The result was that these poor peasants had already been thoroughly emancipated and had received more than their share of the fruits of labor. They did not fully understand the Land Law, but simply said they agreed with it. Comrade Sun felt that he could not learn anything from this, so he stopped using the cadres and instead went to find poor peasants and hired laborers on his own. He found Jin Huanchun's house and talked to him about the Land Law Outline. He said, \"Outline or no outline, we live in Xiangyuan, the place with the most coal, but we don't even have coal in our house. We burn firewood.\" At this time, Comrade Sun talked about his emancipation and his family's living conditions. Jin's wife said, \"The quilt we got was even more ragged than a worn-out set of clothes, half lining and half surface. We also got two cave dwellings and three broken houses. Once, when we went to the meeting to distribute the fruits of labor, the cadres scolded us, saying, 'Look at this poor wretch of a woman, coming to share the fruits of labor!'\" His family is currently eating bran and vegetables, and they will run out of grain by the end of the first lunar month. This winter, they borrowed 20,000 yuan, but they didn't earn a penny. He is currently sick in bed and cannot get up. He said, \"We are outsiders, and we don't dare to express our opinions. I heard that the Land Law is coming, teaching everyone to say what they want, to be completely democratic, but it hasn't been implemented yet. When it is implemented, I will tell you about our suffering!\" Later, Comrade Sun went to Dou Suozhu's house. He said, \"Once in February this year, we distributed the fruits of labor. I heard that I was given 1.3 dou of rice. I went to ask Tiecheng (the instructor at the time), and I said, 'Where did the rice that was allocated to me go?' He got very angry and said, 'Am I shortchanging you on rice? Come and ask me for rice!' Later, I went to ask the brigade leader, Tie Dan (the militia captain), and he scolded me, saying, 'Now that the Eighth Route Army has come, you want rice? You would have starved to death in the days of the enemy, you son of a bitch!' Later, I didn't dare to ask again. Once, District Chief Han saw me and asked me how my life was. I said that my family was currently eating bran and vegetables. District Chief Han asked me if I had finished the rice that was allocated to me. I said I hadn't received it. District Chief Han went to ask the street chief, and the street chief ran to my house and said, 'The rice is at my house. Tell me when you need it and I'll give it to you.' The first time my child went to get it, they said there was no rice. The second time they went to get it, they gave four dou of empty corn cobs, which was equivalent to two dou of rice. They also said that corn cobs can be eaten more. The third time they went to get it, the street chief's wife closed the door and wouldn't let my child into the house. Later, I asked people again, and they said to go to the cooperative to ask for it. I went to ask the cooperative, but the director didn't know. This one pushed to that one, and that one pushed to this one. Finally, they gave me eight dou of rice. There are still three dou of rice that haven't been given to me.\" His family is now eating bran and vegetables, corn cobs and elm leaf dry food, without a single grain of rice. He is sick in bed and cannot get up. Three families like Dou's, who are on the verge of starvation, have already been discovered. When talking to many other people, they don't understand what the Land Law is all about. Deputy Street Chief Li Kui distorted the Land Law completely when he talked to poor peasants like Shen Jincai. He said, \"I know everything about the Land Law. It is about communism, concentrating all the land and things in one place and dividing them equally. The livestock is brought to one place and everyone shares it. The grain is concentrated in one place and everyone shares it. Landlords and rich peasants share equally. In the future, the money earned will be handed over to the public. Every ten families eat out of one big pot, and everyone goes home to sleep at night.\" After discovering these problems, the reasons were preliminarily understood. The main reason is that during last year's movement, the cadres occupied too much of the fruits of labor of the masses. Street chief Zhang Jinsheng stole several bags of beans from the oil mill. The work in the past was done by包办 (Baoban, take on the responsibility of everything). Old man Li Jinkui said that in the past, the distribution of the fruits of labor was done by the cadres, and whatever the cadres gave was what you got. Whatever the cadres saw that was good, they wanted it. Although these cadres are from poor peasant and hired laborer backgrounds, they have forgotten their roots. They repeatedly say that poor peasants and hired laborers have no difficulties, but the result of the inspection is that poor peasants and hired laborers have nothing to eat. Poor peasants and hired laborers have difficulties in winter production, but they have never helped a single poor peasant and hired laborer find a way out of production or solve practical difficulties.

Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Szakasits, stated in his speech at the celebration rally in Budapest: \"The most solid foundation of the Hungarian Republic is the land reform and the consequent destruction of feudal rule. The Third Hungarian Republic has guaranteed the democratic rights of people of all strata.\" Szakasits declared: \"The ten million people of Hungary are fighting together with the people of other democratic countries for the peace and security of the Danube River basin.\" Since the founding of the People's Republic of Hungary two years ago, it has crushed the anti-republican conspiracies of the Szálasi and Pfeiffer new fascist parties and consolidated the new democratic regime. At the same time, it is striding forward towards economic recovery. Due to the nationalization of all large industries and large transportation industries, and the high production enthusiasm of the working people, industrial output has increased month by month. At the beginning of 1946, it was only 35% of that of 1938, but it has now reached 90% of the 1938 level. In the past two years, pig iron production has quadrupled, and steel production has exceeded pre-war levels. The Three-Year Plan, which began on August 1st last year, is making great progress. All major industries have not only completed but also exceeded their monthly plans. One year before the Second World War, Hungary's machine tool production was only 5 million Hungarian Forints, but the value of machine tools produced under the Three-Year Plan will reach 220 million Hungarian Forints. The Three-Year Plan stipulates that the national daily average coal production should be 3,600 truckloads, but on January 29, the miners mined 4,158 truckloads of coal. The land reform was fully completed a few days ago, which is a festival for 642,000 new farmers, of which 371,000 were formerly farmhands or agricultural workers, and they have obtained land for the first time. The land reform increased Hungary's cultivated land area by 500,000 holds last autumn compared to the previous year, totaling 6.8 million holds. The number of cattle has increased by 38% in two years, horses by 49%, and pigs by 70%.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Budapest dispatch: The development of Hungary's coal mining industry is astonishing, and it has now reached the target for 1950, which is the target for the last year of the Three-Year Plan. Since the launch of the labor competition on New Year's Day this year, within a week, it reached the highest record of producing 4,011 truckloads of coal per day, and many coal mines have completed 200% of their plans.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 六十四万多户农民得到土地  匈土地改革全部完成  全国欢庆共和国成立两周年\n\n1948-02-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    六十四万多户农民得到土地\n    匈土地改革全部完成\n    全国欢庆共和国成立两周年\n    【新华社陕北七日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利全国于一日热烈庆祝共和国成立两周年纪念。匈副总理社会党主席斯查卡西克在匈京庆祝大会上演说称：“匈牙利共和国最坚实的基础，就是土地改革及因此引起的封建统治之摧毁，匈牙利第三共和国已保证各阶层人民的民主权利”。斯氏声称：“匈牙利一千万人民正与其他民主国家人民一起，为多脑河流域的和平安全而奋斗”。按匈牙利人民共和国建国两年以来，粉碎了苏略克和费菲尔新法西斯政党的反共和国阴谋，巩固了新民主政权。同时大踏步走向经济复兴。由于一切大工业与大运输业的收归国有，劳动人民高度的生产热情，使工业产量月月增加。一九四六年初仅为一九三八年的百分之三十五，目前已达一九三八年水平百分之九十。过去两年中铣铁增产四倍，钢产已超过战前水平。去年八月一日开始的三年计划正获得极大进展。一切主要工业不但完成而且已超过每月计划。二次大战前一年，匈牙利母机生产仅为五百万匈币，而在三年计划下生产的母机价值将达二亿二千万匈币。三年计划规定全国每日平均产煤三千六百车，但在一月二十九日，矿工们挖出了四千一百五十八车煤。土地改革已于数日前全部完成，这是六十四万二千户新农民的节日，其中三十七万一千户以前是长工或农业工人，他们第一次获得了土地。土改使去年秋季匈牙利耕地面积比前年增加了五十万匈亩，总数达六百八十万匈亩。牛的数目在两年内增加百分之三十八，马增加百分之四十九，猪增加百分之七十。\n    【新华社陕北四日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利煤矿工业发展惊人，目前已到达一九五○年的目标，亦即三年计划最后一年的目标。自今年元旦展开劳动竞赛以来为时一周，即到达日产煤斤四千零十一车的最高记录，许多煤矿已完成计划百分之二百。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E, February 1st\n\nA certain administrative village in Nanzhao County, with the peasant association's poor peasant group as the leading core, firmly united the middle peasants during the land reform. The village has 168 middle peasant households, accounting for about 34 percent of the total number of households in the village. At the beginning of the movement, most of the middle peasants were hesitant and waiting to see what would happen. However, when the hired and poor peasants launched a struggle to pour out their grievances and put forward the slogan \"Hired and poor peasants are one family,\" some middle peasants knocked on the doors of hired and poor peasants at night, asking to join the peasant association. As the movement developed in depth, and preparations were being made to distribute land, the middle peasants generally shifted from watching to actively participating in the struggle, also demanding land distribution, but some well-to-do middle peasants still had some doubts in their minds. The peasant association immediately led the propaganda of the Land Law Outline, focusing on discussing whose land to distribute, the distribution methods, and how to handle debt relationships, and rectified the peasant association, clarified the class lines, dug out the roots of poverty, recognized their own people, and purged the rich peasants Zhang Fuyuan and Tian Guangde, who had infiltrated the peasant association. In the process of class demarcation, the population, land, and property were registered, so that the feudal exploiters and hired/poor and middle peasants were clearly distinguished, and the mood of the middle peasants became more stable and closer to the hired/poor peasants, and the peasant association also absorbed a large number of middle peasants into the association. Some middle peasants who were heavily burdened with debt were very active in settling old accounts and digging up the roots of poverty with the landlords. For example, Zhang某 expressed his firm determination to unite with the poor and overthrow usury at the struggle meeting to settle accounts with Zhang Fuyuan's high-interest exploitation, and requested to join the peasant association. The peasant association immediately announced its approval, and subsequently, more than a dozen middle peasants requested to join the peasant association. In addition, some middle peasants who had served as chiefs, tutors, and squad leaders for the Chiang Kai-shek bandits had engaged in acts of oppression against the hired/poor peasants. The peasant association specially held a \"face-washing meeting\" to allow them to admit their mistakes and apologize to the poor. Li某, Ma某 and others performed well in the village after the face-washing, and the peasant association decided to observe them for a period of time before considering their requests to join the association.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南召某村  发动群众经验\n\n1948-02-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    南召某村\n    发动群众经验\n    【新华社豫陕鄂一日电】南召县某行政村农会以贫农小组为领导核心，在土地改革中坚决团结了中农。该村共有中农一六八户，约占全村户数百分之三十四。在运动开初，中农大多观望不前。但当雇贫农展开诉苦斗争，并提出“雇贫中农一家人”的口号，就有些中农黑夜叫雇贫农的门，要求参加农会。当运动深入发展，准备分地时，中农便较普遍的由观望转变到积极参加斗争，也要求分土地，但个别富裕中农心里还有些疑虑。农会即时领导宣传土地法大纲，着重讨论分谁的地，分配办法和如何处理债务关系，并整顿农会，划清阶级，挖穷根，认清自家人，把混进农会的富农张富元和田广德等清洗出去。在划阶级过程中，登记了人口、土地和财产，使封建剥削者和雇贫中农划清了界线，中农情绪就更加稳定，更加靠拢雇贫，农会也大量吸收中农入会。一部分在债务上背利太大的中农，在和地主算老帐挖穷根时，表现很积极。例如张某在清算张富元的高利盘剥斗争会上表示坚决和穷人一心打倒高利贷，并要求加入农会。农会当场宣布批准，随后又有十多个中农请求参加农会。另外有些中农曾当过蒋匪的甲长夫子班长等，曾有欺压雇贫的行为，农会特地召开“洗脸会”让他们向穷人认错道歉。李某、马某等经洗脸后，在村里表现很好，农会决定再考察一个时期考虑他们的入会的请求。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Yu-Shaan-E, 5th: In a certain administrative village in Nanzhao, the leadership closely combined the economic, political, and armed struggles of the peasants in the movement to help them stand up. This village includes fifteen natural villages, with a total of 701 households, of which 308 households have no house or land. In a preliminary investigation of 57 households by the work team, 41 households had no rice in their pots and lived by begging. The fifteen landlord households occupied more than 52% of the village's land. They also exploited the peasants with usurious loans and charged deposits for renting land. Politically, they were mostly Chiang Kai-shek's bandit township chiefs and Bao chiefs, extorting and plundering in every possible way.\n\nThe peasant emancipation movement began with visiting and listening to grievances. At the grievance meetings, four poor peasants recounted the crimes of a local tyrant landlord named Zhang. He was the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and the supervisor of the stockade construction. An old peasant named Jin said that Zhang wanted to demolish his house when building the stockade and that it cost him a lot of money to prevent it. Old Jin's family had no bedding, and he was heavily fined for being late during the night construction of the stockade. An old woman's son was forced to build the stockade and vomited blood from exhaustion. The entire village spent eight million yuan to build two pillboxes and a wall, all of which was paid for by the poor. Zhang charged a deposit of 200,000 yuan per mu for renting land. As chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, he also arbitrarily collected money from small vendors. An old man worked as a long-term laborer in Zhang's house for twenty years but was driven out without receiving a single penny. The masses cried as they spoke, and more and more people joined in. Seven groups were formed in the process of recounting grievances. After the grievances were recounted, they went to divide up the ill-gotten wealth of Zhang, the village's biggest tyrant landlord.\n\nIn the process of recounting grievances and dividing up the wealth, the poor peasants were organized. The peasants' association, with the poor and hired peasants as its backbone, gradually expanded, united the majority of the middle peasants, and constantly purified its ranks. It reorganized its organization three times in a row, emphasizing \"one heart and one mind\" and \"no double-dealers.\" As a result, Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, lackeys, and rich peasants who had infiltrated the peasants' association were purged.\n\nBecause most of the landlords had fled and bandits were active nearby, the masses immediately began to establish armed forces. After repeated screening of their backgrounds, the first batch of 33 people, armed with rifles, went out to search for landlords and local tyrants and to suppress small groups of bandits. After recounting grievances, dividing up wealth, and establishing armed forces, the morale of the masses was high. They changed from being afraid of the landlords returning to looking forward to their return so they could settle old scores and reclaim their land. However, a small number of peasants had not completely understood the situation, thinking that \"if everyone rides in a sedan chair, who will carry it?\" and \"the poor and the rich are like fish and water, helping each other.\" The peasants' association then led the \"digging up of the roots of poverty\" and \"class demarcation.\" During the digging up of the roots of poverty, they discussed why sedan chair carriers carried sedan chairs generation after generation and where the sedan chairs of the sedan chair riders came from. After discussion, it was clarified that land distribution meant \"the land returns to its original owners.\" Then, in conjunction with the Land Law Outline, they studied and investigated the population, land, and other aspects of the entire administrative village. After three days and three nights of meetings, they clearly defined the boundaries between the peasants and the feudal exploiters. The hired peasants and poor peasants were even more united. In more than a month of struggle, the peasants distributed 776 mu of land, 331 rooms, more than 50,000 catties of grain, and many livestock, furniture, and cotton cloth. After dividing the wealth and land, they elected a democratic government. Now the peasants have truly become the masters of the village and are in charge of their own affairs.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 发动群众中经济、武装、政治斗争密切结合\n\n1948-02-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    发动群众中经济、武装、政治斗争密切结合\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线五日电】南召某行政村农民翻身运动中，领导上把农民的经济斗争、政治斗争和武装斗争密切结合起来。该村包括十五个自然村，总共七百零一户中有三零八户无房无地。工作组初步调查的五十七户中，竟有四十一户锅里无米，靠讨饭活命。而十五户地主却占了全村土地百分之五十二强。他们并用高利贷盘剥农民，租地且收押金。在政治上他们又大都是蒋匪乡保长，敲诈勒索，无所不为。\n    农民翻身运动先从访苦、诉苦开始。在诉苦会上，四个贫农诉说了该村恶霸地主张某的罪恶。他是商会会长，又是修寨子的监工。农民老金说张某修寨时要拆他的房子，花了很多钱才没有拆。老金家里没有铺盖，黑夜修寨误了时间，又被罚了巨款。一个老太太的儿子被逼着修寨，累得吐了血。全村修了两个炮楼和一道墙，花去八百万元，都是穷人出的。张某出租地的押金每亩达二十万元。当商会会长时又乱派小摊贩的款。有个老汉在张家作了二十年的长工，最后一个钱没有得着而被赶出来。群众边诉边哭，人愈来愈多。在诉苦中组成七个小组，诉苦后就去把该村大恶霸地主张某家的浮财分了。\n    在诉苦分浮财过程中，贫苦农民组织起来了。以雇贫为骨干的农会逐渐扩大，团结了大多数的中农，不断的纯洁了自己的阵营，接连三次整理组织，强调“一条心”、“不要两面派”。于是就把混入农会的蒋匪特务、狗腿子、富农等清洗出去。\n    因为地主大都逃出，土匪又在附近活动，群众当即着手建立武装，经再三审查成份后，第一批三十三人即背枪出外搜捕地主恶霸，清剿小股土匪。经过诉苦、分浮、建立武装后，群众情绪高涨，由过去怕地主回来一变为盼地主回来好算老帐，要回土地。但也有一小部分农民没有彻底打通思想，认为“都坐轿，哪有抬轿人”、“穷富就是水帮鱼、鱼帮水”。农会便又领导“挖穷根”，“划阶级”。在挖穷根时讨论了抬轿人为什么辈辈抬轿，坐轿人的轿是哪里来的。经讨论后弄清了分地就是“土地回老家”。于是再配合土地法大纲研究调查全行政村的人口、土地等。开会三天三夜，明确的划分了农民和封建剥削者的界限。雇贫农与中农更加团结。在一个多月斗争中，农民分得了七百七十六亩地，三百三十一间房，五万多斤粮食和许多牲口家具、棉布等。分浮分地之后接着选举了民主政权，现在农民真正成了村里的主人，当了家了。"

Some are boiling locust pods with beans to eat. Needless to say, they won't be eating dumplings for the New Year.\n\n    In previous years, making incense (superstitious items) was a major source of income for the villagers. This year, because the masses' awareness has increased and they oppose superstition, selling incense is banned everywhere, so this business can no longer be done. Relying on spinning cotton and weaving cloth, the profit is too low due to the widespread development of textile production. They lack capital to engage in sideline occupations and cannot make money. In addition, poor peasants and hired laborers have had four cattle and donkeys die of leanness this winter due to lack of grass and fodder. Recently, they borrowed 220,000 yuan from the bank, but due to the severity of the famine, it cannot solve the basic difficulties of the masses.

More than 500 enemies have been annihilated and vast areas liberated. The sweeping up of the remaining bandits continues. Wherever our army goes, it opens granaries to relieve the poor. After fighting a battle, a certain company rested in a village and intercepted more than 60 items of clothing and bedding from fleeing landlords in a village in Hequ, which were distributed according to the degree of poverty. Our political workers often conduct investigations along the way in front of the team to identify Chiang Kai-shek's warehouses and reactionary landlords and evil gentry, and carry many clothes on their saddles, distributing them wherever they encounter impoverished masses.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. A Suiyuan-Mongolian front-line reporter reports on the situation after the liberation of Shaliang Town in Fugu, stating: Shaliang Town was originally a commercial thoroughfare between the mainland and the Ikezhao League. In the past, the market was prosperous, with more than 20 wineries and oil mills. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was exploited by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and after the Japanese surrender, it was ravaged by the Mongolian bandits of Qi Zhizhong's troops. It has been completely changed, with broken walls and rubble all over the streets. Only a few dying beggars huddled under the eaves show that this is a town where humans have not yet become extinct. Liu Jiuwei, a farm laborer's adopted daughter, sat cross-legged on the street, disheveled and unkempt, without any color in her face. Liu Zhenzi, wrapped in a rag, with a pale face and dull eyes, squatted in a street corner, helplessly enduring the severe cold and hunger. Wang Erhai, a farm laborer, was nearly seventy years old and unable to move. His youngest son fled, and his eldest son was unable to support the whole family by digging coal. Last November, Erhai starved to death. The old man Yang Yuzhen also starved to death on the street. When our cavalry soldiers saw this tragic scene, they jumped off their horses and took off their leather coats to put on the old woman, some wrapped naked babies in their own clothes, and some took out dry food and stuffed it into the hands of the villagers. The political organs of the People's Liberation Army issued the call to \"take off clothes to help the poor,\" and the soldiers responded enthusiastically. A certain company donated 33 items of clothing and sent them to the homes of poor people. Liu Han'er, fifty years old, was so cold that he dared not go out all winter. Now he got a pair of cotton trousers, and he shed tears of gratitude. Our army also distributed a large amount of grain and clothing seized from the enemy to the poor masses. Wang Haijin, a farm laborer in a certain village, and his family of four had not seen millet for several months, and were both hungry and cold. He came from twenty miles away and received a pair of leather pants and a pocket full of rice, thanking the People's Liberation Army incessantly as he walked.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 扫荡晋陕绥连接地带傅家匪  绥蒙骑兵歼敌五百\n\n1948-02-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    扫荡晋陕绥连接地带傅家匪\n    绥蒙骑兵歼敌五百\n    【新华社晋绥七日电】绥蒙前线记者报导：一月中旬绥蒙人民解放军骑兵部队渡过黄河，在晋陕绥三省接壤地带（即陕北之府谷、山西之河曲、绥远之准格尔旗一带），扫荡傅匪朱五美、及蒙匪奇致忠等部，已歼敌五百余人，解放广大地区。刻继续扫荡残匪。我军所到之处，即开仓济贫。某连打完仗后在某村休息，截获了河曲某村逃亡地主衣服被褥六十余件，即按贫苦程度进行发放。我政工人员常在队前分组沿途调查蒋匪仓库及反动地主劣绅，并在马鞍上带着许多衣服，哪里碰到贫苦群众就在哪里发放。\n    【新华社晋绥七日电】绥蒙前线记者报导府谷沙梁镇解放后情形称：沙梁镇原为内地及伊克昭盟间之通商要道。昔日市面繁荣，酒坊、油坊达二十余座。抗战期间，经蒋匪压榨，日寇投降后复经蒙匪奇致忠部蹂躏之后，已面目全非，满街断垣残壁，瓦砾遍地。只有几个奄奄待毙的乞丐蜷缩在屋檐下，才显出这是一座人类尚未绝迹的市镇。雇农刘九维的童养媳盘着腿坐在街上，蓬头垢面，毫无人色。刘贞子披着一块破布，脸色灰白，两目无光，双手抱着肩，蹲在街角，无可奈何地忍受着严寒与饥饿。雇农王二海年近古稀，不能动弹。次子逃亡，长子挖炭无法供养全家，去年十一月二海活活饿死。杨愚臻老汉也饿毙街旁。我骑兵战士看见这种惨象，纷纷跳下马来解下自己的皮衣披在老太婆的身上，有的用自己的衣服裹着光屁股的娃娃，有的掏出干粮塞在老乡手里。解放军政治机关发出“解衣济贫”的号召，战士们热烈响应，某连捐出三十三件衣服，送到贫苦人民家里。五十岁的刘憨儿，冻得一冬不敢出门，现在得到一件棉裤，他感激得流出眼泪，我军并将缴获敌人的大批粮食、衣服全部发放给贫苦群众。某村雇农王海金一家四口，几个月不见小米了，又饿又冻，他从二十里外赶来，领到一件皮裤和满口袋米，一边走一边不停的感谢解放军。"

We completely annihilated the enemy's New 5th Army's Provisional 54th Division, the 52nd Army's Transportation Regiment, a Traffic Police Corps, and the garrison personnel of the enemy's New 6th Army, New 5th Army, and 52nd Army stationed in the city. The results of the battle are being tallied. Our army launched a general offensive at 7:00 AM, broke into the city in just one hour and fifteen minutes, and after eight and a half hours, completely resolved the battle, annihilating all the defending enemies in the city, with none escaping. By this point, the enemy's New 5th Army, formed before the start of our Winter Offensive, was completely annihilated in just one month after the 195th and 43rd Divisions were wiped out. The bandit chieftains Chen and Wei did not dare to send a single soldier to reinforce them during this campaign. Liaoyang is the eleventh city we have recovered during the Winter Offensive.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th] Encouraged by the victory of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's Winter Offensive, peasant emancipation movements are sweeping across Kaiyuan, Tieling, Faku, Xinmin, Heishan, Liaozhong, and other areas surrounding Shenyang. As soon as the People's Liberation Army arrives, the peasants accuse the landlords and local bullies of colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu bandits to oppress the peasants, demanding the army's support. In just ten days of marching through the area, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army helped poor peasants and hired laborers distribute over 3 million jin of grain, over 300 head of livestock, 84,226 zhang of cloth, and over 29,000 cotton-padded and unlined garments from the landlords. When the People's Liberation Army arrived at the ancient castle of Kaiyuan, the peasants automatically arrested the big landlord nicknamed \"Ten Thousand Hates,\" organized a people's court for a public trial, and automatically distributed grain and movable property. The peasants in Yangbao Village also automatically arrested the landlord Fu Quanlin, distributing grain and movable property worth 10 million yuan. In Daxi Huang Village of Heishan, only ten-odd li from the Beining Railway, as soon as the poor peasants, women, and children saw the People's Liberation Army arriving in the village, they rushed into the home of the big bully Sun Xianzhong to settle accounts with him. The poor and hired laborers in the village promoted mutual aid and distributed the fruits to a part of Kaoshan Village nearby. When the People's Liberation Army arrived at Banlamen Village in the county, the poor peasant Tan Cheng knelt at the entrance of the village, lamenting and recounting the crime of the bully Jiang Silin who kicked his daughter to death.

    "content": "From the Workers and Peasants, Back to the Workers and Peasants\nCadre Introspection at the Taihang Sixth Prefecture Party Committee Rectification Meeting\n\nZhang Yanni's Introspection on Seizing Fruits\n\n(Lower-middle peasant background, peasant origin, branch committee member, joined the Party in January 1946, started working in November 1946).\n\nI am from Beizhang Village. I used to be the chairman of the Farmers' Association. There are still 19 poor and hired peasant households in the village who have not yet turned over, and three rich peasant households have not been struggled against. Thirteen households have turned over. My background is lower-middle peasant. In the past, I was politically oppressed, but I did not suffer in life. The branch secretary is a veteran soldier of poor and hired peasant origin, good at flaunting his seniority. The head of the village, Zhang Feng, is a poor peasant who used to smoke opium. The deputy head of the village is a poor peasant; his grandfather was a landlord, but his family declined in his father's hands. He is afraid of nothing. The deputy director only thinks about finding petty advantages and is of poor peasant origin.\n\nDuring the Double Reduction [of rent and interest] campaign, the cadres discussed and decided to hold a struggle meeting through the Farmers' Association. If the poor and hired peasants raised opinions that did not meet my decided goals, I would suppress them. During the Double Reduction campaign, I also exchanged four mu of land. The poor peasant Zhang Ziyin had his land seized by the landlord. He asked the cadres to support him, but I said, \"Zhang Ziyin, if you want to raise it, raise it; if you don't want to, forget it,\" thus suppressing him.\n\nAfter the May 4th Directive [referring to a CCP directive on land reform], when distributing land, houses, and livestock, there was no grading. Except for the targets of struggle, regardless of middle or poor peasants, they were divided into seven groups, with cadres participating in each group, asking everyone to make requests. But some poor and hired peasants had been suppressed. After asking for land, they dared not ask for houses; after asking for houses, they dared not ask for livestock. The cadres were afraid of nothing, asking for livestock, land, and houses. Active elements were elected as evaluators. As a result, good land and good houses were given to cadres, evaluators, and military dependents. I said that cadres had made great contributions and should be taken care of. The middle and rich peasants were afraid of being struggled against and also agreed. But at the time, I still thought I was following the poor and hired peasant line.\n\nThe finance and grain committee member was a landowner who operated land. He asked to donate land. The cadres told him to do it voluntarily. The poor and hired peasants said he was not thorough enough. As a result, things were searched out, and he was driven out. The militia then searched out several bundles. I, along with six Party members and a dozen militiamen, collectively embezzled and divided the bundles. I got a felt blanket.\n\nAnother time was stealing fruits. The village head, deputy village head, Farmers' Association chairman, militia instructor, and militiamen were involved. At the time, the idea was that they were all distributed to the masses, and the masses would not say anything good. They stole them so the masses would not know. The militia stood guard and stole some. I got a quilt and a lined pair of trousers. When collecting fruits, I also stole a pair of shoes, a pair of glasses, and a single pair of trousers.\n\nWhen discussing the distribution of farm tools, clothes, and grain, we asked the Farmers' Association to discuss how to distribute them. The poor and hired peasants did not say anything. I said that the land had already been distributed, clothes were for people to wear, grain was for people to eat, and farm tools were for people to use. Let's distribute them according to population, with one widow counted as two people. The branch secretary was afraid that the stolen goods could not be taken out, so he said let's distribute them according to the number of households, except for the targets of struggle. As soon as the Farmers' Association chairman announced it, some people said they were busy and that it should be distributed this way. These were the middle and rich peasants speaking. At the time, I thought that everyone except the targets of struggle were the masses. I did not think of the poor and hired peasants.\n\nAfter stealing the fruits, three Party members heard the masses' feedback that some people had stolen the fruits. They did not admit it. Later, at the Party member meeting, they still shielded each other, asking if the masses' feedback was factual and whether it was instigated by special agents, suppressing the masses.\n\nSeveral comrades in the branch had turned over too much. They said that after struggling against the rich peasants, they revealed themselves, and if they developed further, they would become the target to be struggled against. After distributing the fruits, we held a mass meeting and said that we would not struggle against them anymore. Did everyone have the idea of cutting chives [getting back on their feet]? The middle and rich peasants and the active elements who had turned over said no, while the honest poor and hired peasants did not say anything. I thought I was following the mass line, but in reality, I was following the middle and rich peasant and active element line.\n\nIn the past, I dared not say that I stole fruits because of my own face. When studying in the First Sub-district, Political Commissar Jia said that the upper and lower levels were impure. After calculating myself, there were 19 households that had not completely turned over. The fruits I stole were worth more than 30,000 yuan. In order to save my own face, I dared not say it. If I did not say it, the other comrades would not say it either. These cadres would not follow the poor and hired peasant line, and the 19 households could not turn over. I felt that if I embezzled the fruits, I would be impure and could not follow the poor and hired peasant line.\n\nCao Guangshui's Introspection on Forgetting the Origin\n\n(Red-poor background, born a hired worker, union cadre, joined the Party in July 1946, transferred out of work in November 1947).\n\nThere are 317 households in Northeast Liu Village. There are 47 targets of struggle, but only 15 households were thoroughly struggled against. Why? After the May 4th Directive came down, I resolutely demanded struggle because I had not turned over, had nothing to eat or drink, and had great fighting spirit. The first batch struggled against five big households. The struggle against Zhang Pei did not go well at the beginning and was ridiculed by the landlords. The main reason was that my team was not well organized. I was the hired worker director. There were 47 hired workers. After the meeting, I gathered the hired workers and used actual examples to get through their thinking and break through their personal feelings to overthrow the five big households. The fruits were distributed in first, second, and third grades. Some middle peasants also received some. First grade was 10,000 yuan, second grade 8,000 yuan, and third grade 5,000 yuan. As a result, the poor and middle peasants and the bankrupt landlords and cadres got them, but the hired workers did not. I was not satisfied, and the hired workers were not satisfied either. They had resistance thoughts and wanted to quit. I thought of disbanding the hired worker organization. But after reviewing it at night, I felt it was wrong. If it were disbanded, I would not be able to turn over myself. The next day, I discussed with the hired workers how to turn over. As a result, they sent representatives to the village head and Farmers' Association chairman, preparing to cause factionalism and opinions. The village head agreed to give the hired workers special treatment in the future. In July, another 19 households were struggled against. There were also a lot of fruits obtained. This time, the fruits that could be taken away, such as grain and vegetables, were left for the hired workers from outside. Each hired worker received 300 jin of grain. This time, the fruits were distributed in three grades and nine levels. After going to the district for a meeting in October, the hired worker Hao Cong mobilized to organize hired tenants and the poor. I was the director. I began to deeply struggle. The fruits that came out of the struggle were particularly many and were also distributed in three grades and nine levels. Now, examining the households that were struggled against, only 15 households were thorough. The rest were not thoroughly struggled against. Some were military dependents, and some were shielded by cadres, including me. There were two rich peasants, Du Cungui and Wang Xiang. The cadres said that they worked hard, were poor in their childhood, and started their families through thrift, so they were not struggled against. Those who were not thoroughly struggled against, like Li Ruwen, only had their floating wealth and land confiscated. The cadres considered that he had cash, but the Farmers' Association chairman said he did not. The village head told me he did. There was a contradiction. I was not convinced. I investigated it at night and took out 20 yuan in cash. At that time, I felt that I was capable and had more conflicts with the Farmers' Association chairman. One day, the Farmers' Association wanted to hang Li Ruwen. Du Zongshan of the Farmers' Association said he guaranteed that he had cash. I said I did not know, and everyone did not hang him. I thought, I am not as good as Du Zongshan (I am from a small family), and I am afraid that I will not be able to survive without cash, so I was afraid and not firm. Also, Qiao Sicong sealed the door and was not struggled against. Just as we were about to confiscate him, the county education section chief Kong Zhanfeng sent several letters, and the district chief also explained that Qiao had been a senator. After all, he went through with the masses once, so he was not struggled against. Everyone was discouraged. Now he is still satisfied. At that time, I was shaken. Du Zongshan is Qiao Sicong's nephew. One day, Qiao brought a bottle of wine to Du Zongshan's house. I followed him to see what he was doing. I went over to the gate and heard Qiao say, \"I am going to the county government clinic. Please take care of my family.\" I went into the house. Du Zongshan said, \"My relative brought something. What do you think we should do?\" I could not break through my personal feelings and said, \"Put it down.\" I also drank two glasses. I thought that drinking wine was not me covering him up, but Du Zongshan covering him up. At that time, I forgot the masses.\n\nThe land was distributed first to military dependents, then to cadres, and then to the poor and hired peasants. At this time, some bad land could not be distributed. The cadres said that the struggle was thorough. I was also shaken and thought that the struggle was thorough. In fact, the poor and hired peasants had not completely turned over, and feudalism had not been thoroughly struggled against. At this time, I also complained that the poor and hired peasants did not want the land. Now I realize that it was not that the poor and hired peasants did not want the land, but that the good land had been taken away by the cadres and military dependents, so of course the poor and hired peasants did not want the bad land. Looking back, those who said the struggle was thorough were the middle and rich peasants and some cadres who had eaten their fill. I myself had completely turned over, with a house, land, and a big cart. My thinking changed, and I forgot my origin.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 来自工农回到工农  太行六地委整党会议上的干部反省\n\n1948-02-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    来自工农回到工农\n    太行六地委整党会议上的干部反省\n    张燕尼反省窃占果实\n    （成份下中农，农民出身，分委，四六年一月入党，四六年十一月参加工作）。\n    我是北张庄的，我当过农会主任。现在全村尚有十九户贫雇未翻身，有三户富农未斗。翻身过了的有十三户。我的成份是下中农，过去政治上受压迫，生活上未受难。支书是荣退军人、贫雇成份，好摆资格，正村长张凤是贫雇，吸过料面，副村长是贫雇，他爷是财主，父亲手里破落了，他啥也不怕，副主任光想找些小便宜，是贫雇成份。\n    双减时干部一商量，通过农会开斗争会，贫雇提意见不合我决定的目标，就打击贫雇。双减时我也换了四亩地。贫雇张子隐被地主夺去了地，他要求干部替他说撑腰，我却说：“张子隐，你想提就提，不提就拉倒”，打击了他。\n    五四指示后，分土地、房子、牲口没划等，除斗争对象外，不管中贫农分七个小组，每组都有干部参加，叫各人提出要求。但有些贫雇受过打击，要求了地，就不敢要求房子，要了房子不敢要牲口，干部啥也不怕，要牲口、要地、要房子。选举积极分子当评议员，结果好地好房都给了干部、评议员、军属。我说干部功大，应该照顾一下，中农富农怕斗，也跟着说好，但自己当时还认为走了贫雇路线。\n    财粮委员是经营地主，他要求献田，干部叫他自动，贫雇说他不彻底，结果搜出来东西，把他赶了出去。民兵又去搜出几个包袱，我和六个党员十几个民兵，把包袱集体贪污分了，我得了一个毡子。\n    又一次是偷果实。有正副村长、农会主任、民兵指导员、民兵，当时思想说都分给了群众，群众也不说好，偷了群众也不知道。由民兵站了岗，偷了几个，我分了一个被子、一条夹裤，又在收果实时偷了一双鞋、一付眼镜、一条单裤。\n    讨论分农具衣服粮食等时，叫农会讨论如何分，贫雇不吭，我就说地都分到了，衣是人穿的，粮食是人吃的，农具是人用的，按人口分吧，寡妇一口按二人分。支书怕偷了东西没法拿出来，就说按灶户门分吧，除了斗争对象外一律分。农会主任一宣布下去，就有人说正在忙，就该这样分，这是中农富农说的。当时我想，除了斗争对象外都是群众，没有想到贫雇。\n    偷果实后，有三个党员听到群众反映，说有人偷了果实，自己不承认，后来开党员大会，仍然互相打包庇，说群众反映有没有事实？是不是受了特务的挑拨？把群众都顶住了。\n    支部有几个同志翻身翻过了，说斗争完富农，就露出了自己，自己再发展，就成了目标要被斗。分果实后，开群众大会，说以后不斗了，大家有没有割韭菜思想？中富农和翻身翻过的积极分子，都说没有，而老实贫雇不吭，自己思想以为走了群众路线，实际走了中富农和积极分子路线。\n    过去不敢说自己偷果实，是自己脸面关系，到一分区学习，贾政委说上下不纯，经自己一算，有十九户未翻透身，自己偷的果实，值三万多元，为了保存自己脸面不敢说出来，自己不说出来，其他几个同志亦不会说，这些干部亦不会走贫雇路线，十九户就不能翻身，我觉得贪污了果实就不纯，就不能走贫雇路线。\n    曹光水反省忘了本\n    （成份赤贫，出身雇工，联合社干部，四六年七月入党，四七年十一月调出工作。）\n    东北流村共三一七户。斗争对象四七户，但斗彻底的只十五户。为啥呢？在五四指示下来后，我思想上坚决要求斗争，因自己没翻身，没吃没喝，斗争性很大。头批斗争五大户，开始斗张佩没斗争好，反遭地主们讥笑了一顿，主要是自己队伍未搞好。我是雇工主任，雇工有四七个，散会后我召集雇工，拿实际例子来打通了雇工思想，打破了情面斗倒了五大户。分果实是按一、二、三等分的，有些中农也分到了。一等是一万元，二等八千元，三等五千元。结果贫中农和破落地主干部都得了，就雇工没有，我不满意，雇工们也都不满意，有抵抗思想，想不干了，我就想解散雇工组织。但夜间检讨了一下，觉得不对，假如解散了，就连自己也翻不了身，第二天就找雇工讨论，怎样才能翻身。结果推代表去找村长、农会主任，准备闹宗派、闹意见，村长答应以后特别与雇工分。到七月又斗争了十九户，得的果实也不少，这次就与外来雇工留下一部能拿走的果实，如粮食菜等，每个雇工分到三百斤粮食。这次分果实是分三等九级分的。十月去区开会后，那时雇工郝从，就发动组织雇佃贫，我是主任，开始深入斗争，斗争出来果实特别多，也分三等九级分了。现在检查被斗户，只有十五户彻底了，其余没斗透，有的是军属，有的是干部掩护的，连我在内。有二户富农杜存贵、王祥，干部说人家劳动好，小时也穷，节约省俭起家的，故没斗。没斗透的象李如文，只把浮财和地没收了，干部考虑他有现洋，但农会主任说没有，村长和我说有，矛盾起来，我不服，晚上追查了一下，拿出二十元现洋，那时我觉得自己有能力，愈加和农会主任有矛盾。又一天晚上，农会要吊李如文，农会杜宗山说保证人家有现洋，我说不知道，大家就不吊了。我思想，我不如人家杜宗山（自己是孤门小户），怕没有现洋就吃不开，故害怕就不坚决了。再，乔思从封了门没有斗，正要没收他，县教育科长孔占风就去了几封信，区长亦解释说乔曾是参议员，总算与群众走了一趟，因此没斗。大家泄了气，现在他还在满意，那时我是动摇。杜宗山是乔思从侄，有一天乔拿了一瓶酒，到杜宗山家，我跟着进去看他干啥，我一过去大门听乔说：“我去县府医务所，照顾我家一下。”我进屋，杜宗山说：我亲家送来东西，你说怎么办？我打不破情面，说放下吧，我也喝了二杯，思想喝了酒也不是我掩护他，是杜宗山掩护了他，那时我就忘了群众。\n    分土地是先给军属分，其次是干部，再次才是贫雇。这时有些坏地分不下去，干部都说斗争彻底了，我也就动摇了，也以为斗透了。其实贫雇没翻透身，封建没斗透，这时还埋怨贫雇不要地，现在才认识不是贫雇不要地，是好地都给干部、军属拿走了，赖地当然贫雇不要了。检讨那时说斗彻底的是中富农和一部分吃饱了的干部。我自己也翻透了，有房有地有大车，思想就变了，忘了本了。"

    "date": "1948-02-09",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Taihang News] The Lin County Party Committee is severely punishing bad elements and resolutely stopping the random beatings and killings occurring in a few villages. According to investigations, from December of last year (1947) to the present, a total of twelve people have died in the county. In Nan Jingse Village, five people died in the \"anti-special agent\" campaign, including four rich peasants and one upper-middle peasant. Two people died in struggles in Guo Jia Zhuang, one a middle peasant and the other's class status unknown. In Qian Jia Zhuang, two women died, one a middle peasant who hanged herself because she had an illegitimate child, and the other a landlord's wife who hanged herself because she had not divorced. In Mian Jiao Jiao, a rich peasant woman hanged herself because she had not divorced. In Zhai Di, a middle peasant woman hanged herself fearing she would be denounced as a \"broken shoe\" (promiscuous woman). In Lu Jia Zhuang, a middle peasant died, but the cause is still unclear. The villages involved in struggle sessions include Nan Jingse, Bei Jingse, Nan Lingyang, Nihetou, Tian Jia Jing, Ma An Shan, Guo Jia Zhuang, and seven others. The harms of random beatings and killings were examined at an expanded cadre meeting on the 18th of last month, and three village cadres and one district cadre were punished (another is serving at the front). The detailed situation is as follows:\n\n    In Nan Jingse, two district cadres, knowing full well what they were doing, led the \"anti-special agent\" campaign. Qin Yucheng (secretary of the branch committee) thought: \"Our work in Nan Jingse has always been good,\" and was somewhat complacent. Under his personal heroism, he believed, \"If I commit a mistake, I'll just get criticized at most.\" At the same time, he suspected that special agents wanted to shoot him in the back and considered other village cadres to be \"rightist.\" Thus, through a few individuals and cadres, Li Yaolun (upper-middle peasant) was detained, without the knowledge of some of the masses. Under coercion, Li implicated many people. Under the pressure of Qin and others, Dong Yushu (middle peasant), Li Lushan (rich peasant), and five others died.\n\n    In Nan Lingyang Village, cadres, when handling burdens, privately fined fifteen families (two families of runaway soldiers, one family for raising pigeons, one family for running away, and some poor peasants), totaling 9,009 jin of grain, claiming it was to reduce the burden on the whole village and the poor peasants, but in reality, it was for the cadres to contribute less themselves. Due to bureaucratic leadership and a lack of in-depth understanding of the hired and poor peasants, this matter was previously unknown.\n\n    In production, the county emphasized solving the production funds of the hired and poor peasants. The village cadres then organized a carpentry shop, calling for turning dead assets into living things. Those who didn't have money could contribute trees. They forced the entire village and threatened middle peasants to contribute trees at low prices. For example, Zhang Baoquan's eight trees were valued at only 25,000 yuan (barely the price of one tree). Most of the trees in the village were tagged, and middle peasants wept secretly, feeling dissatisfied with the hired and poor peasants being helped. A total of 214 trees were sawed down (from 35 households), including five rich peasant households, nine upper-middle peasant households, fourteen middle peasant households, and seven poor peasant households. This caused fear among all classes, and everything was sawed open, creating contradictions and confusion among middle and poor peasants, leaving loopholes for landlords to exploit. The most serious problem was the group led by Liang Changhui, director of the armed forces committee. Liang Changhui's separation of property from the landlord in the past was unclear. Now, wanting to win over the hired and poor peasants to cover himself, he appointed Zhang Laigui, a sixteen-year-old penniless child, as the leader of the hired and poor peasant group. Zhang took a measuring cup and went to middle peasant homes to borrow grain and eat at random. In one village, he forcibly \"volunteered\" to borrow 180,000 yuan to help the hired and poor peasants, and no one dared to complain. This actually insulted the hired and poor peasants, making them bear the burden of the name, isolating them.\n\n    Li Hengchang, the political director of Guo Jia Zhuang, was usually corrupt and embezzled in the village, and the masses had many opinions about him, but dared not speak out. This time, he led a few people to struggle against the landlord, forcing two to death.\n\n    After discussion, it was believed that these villages violated the instructions of the higher authorities, violated the Land Law, and violated the demands of the masses – to lead production. Only a few people were engaged in random struggles divorced from the masses, creating contradictions and confusion within the peasantry, and harming the hired and poor peasants. This could not be allowed to continue. Therefore, it was decided to detain Liang Shenghui, Qin Yucheng, Fu Qiyuan, and Li Hengchang by the government, pending future investigation (Hao Dacheng went to the front and has not returned). These punishments were announced at the cadre meetings of all districts and villages in the county. The punished district cadres were detained on the spot. The village cadres were dealt with at the district cadre meeting and then sent to the county.\n\n    At the expanded cadre meeting, it was strictly forbidden to have such illegal behavior again, otherwise, it would be severely punished. It was also clarified that the current focus is on winter production and the publicity of the Land Law Outline, with the following specific regulations:\n\n    1. Stop class demarcation. If production needs to solve the difficulties of the hired and poor peasants, the masses of the entire village can discuss who really has difficulties and then solve them. Because at this time, class demarcation is neither accurate on one side nor clear on the other, dragging out the time and affecting mass production. It will be demarcated after the distribution begins.\n\n    2. Resolutely return the funds of the middle peasants and those who have been struggled against in disguise. The method of return is: return the funds that have not been lent to the hired and poor peasants. If the hired and poor peasants are using these funds for production, they can be returned first from the village finance and the fruits of struggle. The hired and poor peasants will return the fruits of struggle and the village finance when they are due, so as not to make one mistake after another.\n\n    3. If there are landlords and bad elements who violate the Land Law Outline by transferring property, resolutely send them to the government for detention, pending disposal during distribution. The facts can be widely discussed and educated among the masses, and the property sold by them can be confiscated by the peasant association, preserved and registered, and disposed of during distribution.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 林县县委严办坏分子  制止乱斗乱杀现象\n\n1948-02-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    林县县委严办坏分子\n    制止乱斗乱杀现象\n    【太行消息】林县县委严厉惩办坏分子，坚决制止少数村乱斗、乱杀现象。据检查去年（四七年）十二月到现在，全县共死了十二个人。南景色村反特务，死了五个，内四个富农、一个上中农。郭家庄斗争死了两个，一个中农，另一成份不知。前家庄两个妇女，一个是中农，因有私生子吊死的；一个是地主妇女，因未离了婚吊死的。面交角一个富农妇女，因没离了婚吊死了。寨底一个中农妇女，怕斗破鞋吊死了。路家庄死了一个中农，原因还未查清。搞斗争村，有南景色、北景色、南陵阳、逆河头、田家井、马安山、郭家庄等七个村。在上月十八日扩大干部会上检讨了乱斗、乱杀的危害，并处分了三个村干部和一个区干部（另一个在前方参战），详细情况如下：\n    南景色是两个区干部领导着明知故犯反特务的。秦玉成（分委）的思想是：我南景色工作一贯不错，有些自满，而在个人英雄主义下，认为“犯就犯了，顶多挨顿批评”，同时疑心特务想打自己黑枪；又认为其他村干部“右”。于是经过少数分子和干部，将李耀轮扣起来（上中农），有些群众并不知道。李在逼迫下，咬出许多人。在秦等追逼下死了董玉树（中农）、李禄山（富农）等五个人。\n    南陵阳村干部在办负担时，私自罚了十五家（两家逃亡战士、一家因养鸽子、一家因逃跑、还有些贫农），共米九千零九斤，说是为了减轻全村和贫农的负担，实际是为的干部自己少出。由于领导上的官僚主义，不深入雇贫，以前不知此事。\n    生产中，县上强调解决雇贫生产资金，村干部就组织木匠铺，号召死财变活物，入股没钱就入树，强迫全村与威胁中农贱价入树。如张保全家八棵树，只作价二万五千元（仅顶一棵树价多一点）。全村大部树都号了，中农暗地哭泣，对被扶助的雇贫不满。共锯了二百一十四棵（三十五户的树），其中富农五户，上中农九户，中农十四户，贫农七户。因此引起各阶层的恐惶，都锯开了，造成中贫农相互间的矛盾与混乱，给地主留了可钻的空子。最严重的问题是武委会主任梁长会的小组，梁长会过去与地主分家不清，现在想此拉拢雇贫，掩护自己，就叫十六岁赤贫小孩张来贵当了雇贫组长，拿着升子乱到中农家借粮吃饭。又在一个闾强迫“自愿”借款十八万元，来扶助雇贫，谁也不敢反映。这实际是污辱雇贫，叫雇贫顶骂名，造成雇贫孤立。\n    郭家庄政治主任李恒昌，平时在村贪污腐化，群众对他意见很多，但不敢说。这次他领导少数人斗争地主，逼死两个。\n    经过讨论，认为这些村违犯了上级指示，又违犯了土地法，更违犯了群众要求——领导生产。仅少数人在脱离群众的乱斗，造成农民内部的矛盾和混乱，害了雇贫。绝不能继续下去。因此决定将梁生会、秦玉成、傅起元、李恒昌等由政府扣起，待将来平分究办（郝大成去前方还未回）。这些处分，并在全县各区、村干部会上公布了，受处分的区干部当场留下。村干部在区干部会上处理后送县。\n    扩干会上，并严禁今后再有此类犯法行为，否则一定要严惩。并明确了现在集中火力进行冬季生产和土地法大纲宣传，具体规定了：\n    一、停止划阶级，如生产上要解决雇贫困难，可叫全村群众讨论，谁真有困难就可解决。因这时划阶级一方划不对，一方划不清，拖时间长了，影响群众生产，等平分开始后再划。\n    二、集中中农资金与变相斗争了中农的，坚决退还，退的办法是：没借给雇贫的退回去，如雇贫正用这些钱生产时，可首先由村财政和斗争果实里退还，雇贫到期还斗争果实和村财政，不要一错再错。\n    三、如有违犯土地法大纲的地主和坏分子转卖财产的，坚决送政府扣押，待平分时处理。可将事实在群众中普遍讨论、教育，并由农会没收他变卖的财产，保存登记，等平分时处理。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. According to consolidated news from newspapers in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas: The Chiang bandits are actively monopolizing the production and sale of salt in the Changlu and Shanghai salt districts. The Tianjin branch of the China Salt Industry Corporation, the salt industry trust established by Chiang Kai-shek, exclusively controls nearly 40% of the total output of civilian salt fields in the Hangu, Tanggu, and Xinhe areas of the Changlu district. Furthermore, it has established a chemical plant in Dagu to trial-produce refined salt, bleaching powder, liquid sodium hydroxide, and other products, monopolizing the North China market. Relying on political power, this corporation seizes civilian salt fields. Among the salt fields \"taken over\" from the Japanese, 35 in Xinhe and several salt flats in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts of Dagu have not yet been returned to private operation. Appeals from the owners to the Chiang Kai-shek Nanjing government have been shelved. The Changlu District Salt Administration of the Chiang bandits has increased the salt tax to 250,000 yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg) starting from January 1st this year, with even inferior salt taxed at 200,000 yuan. Salt that had already left the salt fields and was being transported to Peiping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou before the end of the year was also forcibly prohibited from being transported by the Chiang bandits in preparation for tax increases. Since the Chiang bandits monopolized the North China salt industry, civilian salt production has greatly decreased. Last year, civilian salt production in the Changlu district was only over 5.3 million dan, approximately 56% of the estimated output. The salt farmers of Pudong in Shanghai are also being severely exploited under the strict control of the Yuanpu Salt Field Administration of the Chiang bandits. This salt administration opens salt warehouses, purchasing civilian salt at low prices and issuing IOUs (white slips) in lieu of salt payments, or deliberately delaying salt payments for over ten days before issuing them to the salt farmers, or refusing to accept salt under the pretext of full warehouses. At the same time, they send police to obstruct the salt farmers, falsely accusing them of smuggling, and prohibiting them from carrying salt home, in order to achieve the purpose of oppression. In October of last year, over a hundred salt farmers were brutally beaten under such circumstances. This administration also extorts so-called \"welfare fees\" from the salt farmers, a practice that has been going on for two years. In selling salt, they arbitrarily raise prices to exploit the people. In December of last year, in addition to the \"official price\" increasing to 60,000 yuan per dan, and a salt tax of 100,000 yuan, there was also a so-called \"business fee\" of 40,000 yuan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪垄断津沪盐业  民间盐田横遭霸占\n\n1948-02-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    蒋匪垄断津沪盐业\n    民间盐田横遭霸占\n    【新华社陕北五日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋匪积极垄断长芦、上海两盐区的食盐产销。其盐业托辣斯中国盐业股份有限公司天津分公司在长芦区的汉沽、塘沽、新河三地独占的盐场产量，已近民间全部盐场产量的百分之四十；且在大沽设立化学工厂，试产再制盐及漂白粉、液体氢氧化钠等，独霸华北市场。该公司依仗政治权力，霸占民间盐田，其由日寇手中“接收”的盐田中，即有新河的三十五幅，大沽一、二、三、四、五区的若干盐滩，迄未还归民营，各业主向蒋匪南京政府控诉，亦遭搁置。蒋匪长芦区盐管局今年一月一日起已将盐税提高至每担廿五万元，次等食盐亦征税廿万元。年底前已出盐场运至平、津、张家口之盐斤，亦曾被蒋匪强力禁止转运，以备增税，自蒋匪垄断华北盐业以来，民盐产量大减，去年长芦区民盐仅产五百三十余万担，约合预计产量百分之五十六。上海的浦东盐民亦在蒋匪袁浦盐场公署的严厉管制下，横被剥削。该盐署开设盐仓，低价统购民盐，且印发白票以代盐价，或故意拖欠盐价周转十数日后始发给盐民，或借口仓满，拒绝收盐，一面又派警察阻拦盐民，诬以走私，不准挑盐回家，以达压榨目的。去年十月且有百余盐民以此类情形遭受毒打。该署并向盐民勒征所谓“福利费”，行之已达两年。其销售食盐，则任意抬价剥削人民，去年十二月间，每担除“正价”增至六万元，加收盐税十万元外，并有所谓“业务费”四万元。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "On the Incompatibility of Shortcomings and the Seriousness of the Bolsheviks\nBy Sliepov\nTranslated by Su Ying\n\nThe Communist Party is the mortal enemy of stagnation and conservatism. It is never satisfied with the achievements it has made, but always looks forward. From the essence of our party and its revolutionary spirit arises the Bolshevik incompatibility with shortcomings. \"A ruthless exposure of one's own shortcomings is essential for all vibrant political parties. There is nothing worse than complacent optimism.\" (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 7, p. 305)\n\nPride, arrogance, and complacency are alien to the Bolshevik Party members. Lenin and Stalin rebuked those staff who were content with certain achievements and forgot their shortcomings. At the 15th National Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin said to these people: \"Having two or three major achievements makes them arrogant, and having two or three more major achievements makes them proud and indifferent to everything.\"\n\nTo show the Bolshevik intolerance of shortcomings means not to be carried away by victory, not to relax work because of even a small temptation, to clearly see the problems that have not yet been solved, and to face the mistakes squarely.\n\nEveryone knows that shortcomings are easier to correct if they are not allowed to develop. Mistakes often start small, but when they are not noticed, they develop into big mistakes. \"Everyone is likely to have sores, but if the sores begin to fester, they may become incurable.\" (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 26, p. 99) We should cultivate our most valuable quality - being able to see, expose, and prevent shortcomings as soon as they occur. Therefore, some individual staff members are afraid of being seen as inadequate and fabricate various excuses to cover up or evade shortcomings in order to \"pretend to be innocent.\" This is intolerable. The Bolshevik Party cannot treat people or things from the point of view of personal or temporary interests, but should always stand above the interests of the state and objectively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of its work.\n\nNot hiding shortcomings - this is a constant requirement for leaders, but that is not all. What is important is to be good at sincerely exposing the root causes of shortcomings and finding ways to correct them. Bolshevik leaders cannot evade responsibility and cannot bow down in the face of difficulties - they must do everything in their power to overcome them. What is the use if the staff only knows to lament the difficulties without truly fighting them?\n\nThe incompatibility with shortcomings is manifested in the Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. How can we expose shortcomings without public criticism and analysis? Criticism and self-criticism are the real driving force and powerful weapons mastered by our party.\n\nBolshevik self-criticism is a method of exposing and correcting errors in leadership. We need self-criticism as much as we need air and water. Comrade Stalin said: \"I believe that without self-criticism, our party cannot move forward, cannot expose our sores, and cannot eliminate our shortcomings.\"\n\nThe incompatibility with shortcomings means that leaders should be very serious in their work, not sloppy, not decide issues based on family and friends, but have a high degree of seriousness, so that they can expose shortcomings in time, find ways to correct them, and correctly educate cadres.\n\nA truly serious spirit does not allow for accommodation because of \"position\" and \"merit.\" It should apply equally to good and bad staff. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Some people often think that this seriousness is only used to treat bad staff, and regard it as a special whip in the hands of leaders, used to deal with lazy people. This view is incorrect. It is harmful to work and cadre education. Let's take such a fact as an example. For a long time, the \"New Brass\" machine trust station in the Saradov Province, led by Comrade Achikin, was considered an advanced station. Everything was done well, and its leaders received endless praise, but no shortcomings in their work were pointed out. Therefore, Comrade Achikin also felt that he was a truly perfect person, and became complacent. When it came to harvesting crops, he said, \"We don't have to worry about anything, we will finish harvesting first anyway.\" As a result of this relaxation, the station started the harvesting campaign very late. What was the result? As a result, the machine tractor station led by Comrade Achikin fell behind in harvesting and delayed the harvesting of the collective farms supplied by its tractors.\n\nEven good staff are not immune to making mistakes and having shortcomings; without this seriousness, even good staff do not have a critical spirit towards their work. Bolshevik seriousness means: to examine people based on the effect of their work. This examination is not based on some fragmented \"shock\" work, but on constant work, constantly supervising the implementation of instructions, which can cultivate accuracy and seriousness in the staff. No matter how much you say about the necessity and benefits of discipline, if the decisions made are quickly forgotten, discipline will be abandoned and laxity will occur, and as a result, the sense of responsibility will be lost.\n\nTo be serious means to organize leadership in such a way that any act of undermining the party's instructions cannot escape accountability. In this regard, not only top-down inspection plays a great role, but that alone is not enough. Stalin instructed the importance of bottom-up inspection, that is, the led inspect the leaders, expose their mistakes, and point out ways to correct these mistakes. The method for party members and the masses to inspect their leaders at activist meetings and delegate meetings is to listen to their summary reports, criticize their shortcomings, and elect or not elect them to leading organs. Without such inspection, cadres cannot be correctly educated with a spirit of incompatibility with errors and shortcomings.\n\nSeriousness in work and bureaucratic management - crude \"responsibility\" - have nothing in common. Bureaucratic management is a product of ignorance, a result of lack of leadership. Such phenomena occur in places that do not study the essence of things, do not have correct cadre deployment, attempt to monopolize everything, do not absorb knowledgeable people to participate, do not study the experience of the masses, and do not consider the opinions of the collective of party staff.\n\nBureaucratic management means that orders and leadership do not rely on activists. The task of leadership lies precisely in uniting activists and organizing the deployment actions of staff from various departments in order to \"advance work not independently, but should be organized, united, and thus obtain the greatest guarantee of success\" (Zhdanov).\n\nAccompanying bureaucratic management is the frequent transfer of cadres, but little do they know that the organizational work of handling cadres itself contains an educational component. Good leadership is first and foremost the education and training of cadres, and providing them with practical assistance; of course, punishment also has its educational significance, but if punishment is abused, it will not become a method of education, because cadres will not care about punishment.\n\nThere are also situations where firm disposal is needed, but the leadership goes on to persuade, and when they see that the staff has made mistakes, the leadership hesitates and replaces punishment with a liberal attitude.\n\nLet's take the facts of the Udmurt Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) as an example. There is no seriousness in dealing with staff here. The construction design trust led by Baier himself behaved improperly and deceived his superiors, but the provincial committee did not expose such staff, but instead sheltered him and protected him, damaging our cause. Moreover, such facts are not isolated phenomena. This is not consolidating discipline, but causing serious damage to cadre education.\n\nCorrectly educating cadres does not mean uniting them through private friendship, covering up their shortcomings, and accommodating their self-esteem. Party staff should have a basic precept for themselves - do not accommodate individual personnel, no matter how high their position, but only respect the cause, respect the interests of the cause. This is how Comrade Stalin taught us.\n\nIn some individual cases, leaders are afraid of being accused of bureaucratic management and dare not strictly demand the implementation of the party's instructions, and blame seriousness as superfluous. This can only be the case for those who only want to live a comfortable life and, after achieving their first success, look up to the sky and become complacent. If a leader acts for the benefit of the cause, he works hard, he can demand that others be like him, then what is wrong with this seriousness for him?\n\nSeriousness and incompatibility with shortcomings are only possible for those leaders who are truly free from bureaucratic habits. Staff who lack principle in their work and do not restrain their actions associate themselves with those who are sycophantic and unscrupulous. Such staff show helplessness in the struggle against shortcomings and sins. Here, the atmosphere of mutual protection and sentimentalism replaces principle and seriousness.\n\nComrade Stalin pointed out how much harm such non-Bolshevik habits as sentimentalism and mutual protection can cause, and that these things will eventually lead to mutual forgiveness of mistakes. He said: \"For example, Zhang San, a senior leader of a certain organization, made a big mistake and messed things up, but Li Si is unwilling to criticize him, unwilling to expose and correct his mistakes. He is unwilling to criticize because he does not want to 'make enemies for himself.' What's the big deal if he makes mistakes and messes things up?! Who among us doesn't make mistakes?! Today we forgive him - Zhang San, and tomorrow he can forgive me - Li Si, because how can he be sure that I won't make mistakes?! How nice it is for everyone to be polite and get along peacefully! Letting mistakes go by - does this harm our great cause? Nothing, just deal with it. Comrades, this is the common view of some of our responsible comrades, but what does this mean? We Bolsheviks are people who criticize the whole world, and who, in Marx's words, are people who turn the world upside down. If we give up self-criticism in order to avoid bothering certain comrades, there will be no other result than overturning our great cause. Isn't this obvious?\"\n\nWherever family-style problem-solving prevails, there is no seriousness, and there is tolerance of shortcomings and errors, and often even tolerance of sins.\n\nLet's take such an example: Not long ago, the State Inspection Agency of the Kyrgyz League Republic discovered facts of randomly distributing goods, privately supplying, and violating financial discipline when inspecting the work of the republic's agricultural supply department. The supply department did a very poor job of the work stipulated for machine tractor station repair factories, workshops, collective farms, and supplying machines and machine parts. The leaders of the Kyrgyz Republic's Ministry of Agriculture knew that the supply department was doing a very poor job, and treated some of its staff liberally. They did not point out the significant harm of this activity, and did not show the necessary seriousness. If you ask why this is, it is because the leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture themselves sometimes participated in such illegal behavior. They wasted a large amount of cloth allocated to machine tractor stations, agricultural technology schools, and ordinary schools in violation of regulations, and distributed part of it to the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and the supply department, and randomly distributed other items.\n\nFor these reasons, the leaders of the department were to some extent involved with the staff of the lower-level supply department, and lost their weapons in the struggle against the serious shortcomings in their work. This illustrates how important the ideological purity of leaders is in their relationship with those they supervise!\n\nParty staff give direction to cadres in various work departments. Comrade Stalin's words about the Soviet Party inspectors are more important to Party staff than to anyone else. Comrade Stalin said: \"They should be pure and flawless, and pursue the truth, so that they can not only have formal authority, but also have ideological authority to examine and educate others.\"\n\nIdeological education is the most important condition for educating cadres in the seriousness of their work and their incompatibility with shortcomings. Studying the theories of Marxism-Leninism can deeply understand the party's policies, and thus improve each staff member's sense of responsibility and obligation to the state. Only conscious and ideologically trained people can understand their obligations to the party and their responsibility to the party.\n\nIncompatibility with shortcomings and a high degree of seriousness have been and still are the basis for correctly educating cadres.\n\n(Translated from the August 26, 1947, issue of Pravda)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 论对缺点的不调和性及布尔什维克的严肃性\n斯列波夫\n1948-02-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    论对缺点的不调和性及布尔什维克的严肃性\n    斯列波夫作\n    苏瑛译\n    共产党是对于停滞不进及保守主义的死敌，从来不满足于已获得的成绩，而总是向前看，从我党的本质及其革命的精神中，产生了对缺点的布尔什维克的不调和性。“对本身缺点无情的揭露是一切生动活泼的政党所必需的，没有比自满的乐天主义再坏的事了。”（列宁全集七卷三百零五页）\n    骄傲自负、泰然自若和布尔什维克党人是没有因缘的，列宁和斯大林责备这样一些工作人员，对他们来说只要有某些成绩就足以使他们苟安自满，而忘记缺点。斯大林在联共（布）第十五次全国代表大会上，对这部分人说：“只要有两三个大的成绩就已目空一切，要再有两三个大的成绩就骄傲起来，百事不在乎了。”\n    对缺点表现布尔什维克的不能容忍态度，这就是说不因胜利而冲昏头脑，不因即使是很小的诱惑而松懈工作，清楚地看见尚未解决的问题，要正视错误。\n    大家知道如果不让缺点发展下去，那它是比较容易改掉的，错误经常是从很小开始，可是当它不被人所注意的时候，它就发展成大的错误。“所有的人都可能害疮，但如果这个疮开始腐烂时，就可能变成不治之症。”（列宁全集第二十六卷九十九页）我们应该培养自己最宝贵的品质——当缺点刚一发生的时候，就要善于看出、揭穿，并预防它。因此有些个别的工作人员，害怕对自己不如意，而杜撰各种辩词来掩盖或者逃避缺点，以“故作清白”。这就是不可容忍的事。布尔什维克的党不能以个人利益或者暂时利益的观点去对待人或事物，而应该永远站在国家利益之上，客观地估计工作中的优点和缺点。\n    不隐瞒缺点——这是对领导者不变的要求，但这还不是事情的全部，而重要的是善于诚心诚意地揭发产生缺点的根源，及找到纠正缺点的方法。布尔什维克的领导人不能够逃避责任，不能在困难面前低头，——他必须尽其全力来克服它。假如工作人员只知道困难悲叹，而不真正的同困难作斗争，那有什么用处呢？  \n    对缺点的不调和性，表现在布尔什维克的批评和自我批评上，如不公开批评，并分析缺点，那怎么叫做揭发缺点呢？批评和自我批评是我党所掌握的真正动力和强大武器。\n    布尔什维克的自我批评，是暴露和纠正领导方面错误的方法，我们需要自我批评象需要空气和水一样。斯大林同志说：“我认为没有自我批评，我们党就不能前进，就不能揭发我们的疮疾，就不能消灭我们的缺点”。\n    对缺点的不调和性，这就是说：领导者应该是在工作中很严肃，不是马马虎虎，不是从家庭、亲友方式决定问题，而是有高度的严肃性，这才能及时揭露缺点，找到纠正缺点的途径，正确地教育干部。\n    真正的严肃精神，不容因“职位”和“功勋”而有所迁就，它应该同样的适用于好的和不好的工作人员。可惜并不经常是这样的，有人常常认为这种严肃精神只拿去对待不好的工作人员，把它看成是领导者手中的特种鞭子，为对付懒惰的人使用的。这种意见是不正确的，它有害于工作及干部教育。拿这样的事实作例吧，就是从阿赤金同志所领导的萨拉多夫省“新布拉斯”机器托拉斯站，在很长时间中都认为是先进的站，该站一切工作都作得挺好，它的领导能受到无限赞扬，但没有指出他们工作中的缺点，因此阿赤金同志也觉得自己真正是十全十美的人了，而自满自足起来了，到收割庄稼的时候，他说道：“我们没有什么可着急的，反正我们会先收割完”。这样松懈的结果，使得该站很迟的才开始收割运动，而结果怎样呢？结果阿赤金同志所领导的机器拖拉机站，在收割方面落后了，并拖延了被它供给拖拉机的集体农场的收割。\n    就是很好的工作人员也不保险不犯错误，没有缺点；要是缺乏这种严肃性，就是好的工作人员对待自己工作也没有批评的精神了。布尔什维克的严肃性就是说：要根据人民工作的效果来审查他们，这种审查不是根据某种片断的“突击”工作，而是根据经常的工作，不断的对执行指令、指示加以监督，能培养工作人员的准确性及严肃性，不管你说了多少关于纪律的必要及好处，而作出的决议很快就被忘记的话，那就会废弛纪律，发生散漫，结果责任心就一定丧失。\n    要有严肃性，这就是说：要这样的组织领导，使得任何破坏党的指令的行为不能不受到追究。在这一方面起着很大作用的，不仅是自上而下的审查，单单这样还不够，斯大林曾指示自下而上进行审查的重要性，即被领导者审查领导者，揭发他们的错误，指出纠正这些错误的办法。党员群众在积极分子会议上，在代表会议上，来审查自己的领导者的方法，就是听取他们总结报告，批评他们的缺点，选举或不选举他们到领导机关去。没有这样的审查，就不能够用对错误和缺点的不调和精神，来正确地教育干部。\n    工作中的严肃性和官僚管理——粗暴的“负责”，是没有任何共同之点的。官僚管理是一种无知的产物，是缺乏领导的结果，不会研究事物的本质，没有正确的配备干部，企图个人独断一切，不吸收懂事的人参加，不研究群众的经验，不考虑党工作人员集体的意见的地方，就有这样的现象。\n    官僚管理就是说：命令和领导不依靠积极分子。而领导上的任务，恰在团结积极分子，需要组织各种不同部门工作人员的配备行动，以便“推进工作不是各自为政、各干各的，而是应该组织起来，团结起来，因而获得成功的最大保证”（日丹诺夫语）。\n    伴随官僚管理而来的，照例是时常调换干部，殊不知处理干部的组织工作，本身就包含有教育的成份。好的领导，首先是教育和训练干部，并给他们以实际的帮助；当然处罚也有其教育意义，但要是滥用处罚，就不成其为教育的方法，因为干部会对处罚不在乎了。\n    也有这样的情况：需要坚决的处置时，而领导上却去进行劝说，看到工作人员有过失时，领导上却犹豫不决，以自由主义的态度代替了处罚。\n    就拿联共（布）乌得幕尔特省委的事实作例子，在这里没有对待工作人员的严肃性，巴依叶尔领导的建筑设计托拉斯，他本人行为不正，欺瞒上级，而省委不去揭露这种工作人员，反而包庇他，掩护他，去损害我们事业，而且这样的事实不是个别的现象，这不是巩固纪律，而是使干部教育受到严重的损失。\n    正确的教育干部，并不是用私人朋友关系来团结他们，掩护他们的缺点，姑息他们的自尊心。党的工作人员，应该对自己有一个基本的训诫——不要姑息个别的人员，不管他们有多么高的职位，只是要尊重事业，尊重事业的利益。斯大林同志是这样教导我们的。\n    在某些个别的情况下，领导工作者害怕别人责备他为官僚管理，不敢严格的要求执行党的指令，责难严肃性是多余的，这只可能是这样一些人：他们只想轻松的生活，并在取得第一个成功之后，就仰首天外，自满自慰。假如一个领导者他是为事业的利益而行动，他努力工作，他可以要求别人和他一样，那么这种严肃性对他有什么不好呢？\n    对缺点的严肃性及不调和性，只有那些真正不受官僚习气的领导人，才有可能的。在工作中没有原则性，对自己行动不约束的工作人员，就使自己同那些阿谀奉承不正派的人同流合污了。这样的工作人员，在同缺点和罪过作斗争中，表现了束手无策，这里互相包庇及温情主义的风气，就代替了原则性和严肃性。\n    斯大林同志曾指出：象温情主义及互相包庇这种非布尔什维克的习气，会发生多大的害处，最后这些东西必至引向相互原谅错误。他说：“譬如说某个组织的高级领导者张三犯了很大的错误，并且把事情搞坏了，但是李四不愿批评他，不愿揭露和纠正他的错误。不愿批评是因为不愿意‘给自己树立敌人’，犯了错误坏了事情这有什么要紧？！我们大家谁不犯错误呢？！今天我们原谅了他——张三，明天他就能原谅我——李四，因为怎么能保险我不犯错误呢？大家客客气气，和平相处多好呢？让错误放过去这就损害了我们的伟大事业么？没有什么，反正对付过去就行。同志，这是我们某些负责同志常有的议论，但这是什么意思呢？我们布尔什维克是批评整个世界的人，用马克斯的话来说是：翻天覆地的人，假如我们为了使某些同志不麻烦，而放弃自我批评，这除了倾覆我们的伟大事业而外，就不会有另外的结果，难道这还不明显么？”\n    什么地方家庭式的解决问题占了上风，哪里就没有严肃性，哪里就容忍缺点和错误，甚至常常容忍罪过。\n    我们举这样一个例子吧：不久前吉尔吉支盟员共和国的国家检查机关，在检查该共和国农业供给处的工作时，发现了乱分配货物，私自供给，违反财政纪律的事实，而该供给处把所规定对于机器拖拉机站修理工厂、作坊、集体农庄、供给机器及机器零件的工作做得很不好，吉尔吉支共和国农业部的领导人，明知供给处工作做得很不好，而且自由主义地对待他的某些工作人员、没有指出他们这种活动的重大损害，没有表现必须的严肃性，如果问这是为什么呢？就是因为该农业部的领导者本身，有时也参加了这种非法的行为，他们不按规定，比如把配给机器拖拉机站、农业技术学校及普通学校的很大数量的布匹浪费了，而且把一部分分给农业部及供给处的工作人员了，还乱分了其他的物品。\n    由于这些缘故，该部的领导者在某种程度上，就和下级供给处的工作人员有了牵扯，而在同他们工作中的严重缺点作斗争中，就失去了武器。这一点说明了：同自己监督下的人员的互相关系中，领导者思想上的纯洁，是如何的重要啊！\n    党的工作人员，是给各个工作部门的干部，在工作上指示方向的，斯大林同志关于苏维埃的党的监察人员说过的话，对于党的工作人员，比对任何其他的人员更为重要。斯大林同志说：“他们应该纯洁无瑕，追求真理，以求他们不仅能够有形式上的权威，而且要有思想上的权威来审查和教育别人”。\n    思想教育是教育干部在工作中的严肃性，及对缺点之不调和性的最重要条件，研究马列主义的理论，能够深刻了解党的政策，而因此提高每个工作人员的责任心和对国家义务的感觉，只有自觉的和思想曾受锻炼的人，才能明白自己对党的义务，自己对党所负的责任。\n    对缺点的不调和性，高度的严肃性，过去曾是现在也还是正确教育干部的基础。            \n          （译自四七年八月二十六日真理报）"

    "content": "[Taihang News] In many districts and villages in Licheng and other places, the poor and hired peasants are at the core, uniting with middle peasants to hold meetings of poor and middle peasant associations or family-style discussions to deeply discuss the spirit of the Land Law, which has played a significant role in stabilizing middle peasants and uniting all peasants. When the Land Law was first promulgated, some middle peasants did not understand it, and landlords and rich peasants spread rumors and sabotage, causing some middle peasants, especially wealthier middle peasants, to experience panic and anxiety, as well as wasteful and unproductive behavior. The local leadership discovered these problems and promptly proposed that, in addition to in-depth publicity among poor and hired peasants, publicity to middle peasants must also be strengthened so that all peasants can generally understand the Land Law and unite to thoroughly realize equal distribution. In the second, fourth, and sixth districts of Licheng, as well as in certain villages in She County, Wuxiang, Huguan, and Pingshun, meetings of poor and middle peasant associations and family meetings were held successively. First, the poor and hired peasants discussed uniting with middle peasants while studying the Land Law, and then, at family meetings, they explained the Land Law to the middle peasants, mobilized the middle peasants to talk and eliminate misunderstandings, so that the middle peasants truly understood the relationship between equal distribution and themselves. At the meeting of poor and hired peasants in Dougong Village, Sixth District of She County, it was clearly stated that, in order to thoroughly eliminate feudalism and do a good job of equal distribution, in addition to the leadership of the poor and hired peasants, it is necessary to unite with the middle peasants. Poor peasant Liu Shuke said: \"Since we want to be in charge and be the masters, we must be careful, never say unreasonable things, handle things well, and not let the landlords and feudal elements get away with anything. In addition, we must not strike at our own people.\" Liu Jincai added: \"We must remember to resolutely unite with the middle peasants.\" After the discussion among the poor and hired peasants, a meeting of middle and poor peasants was held in the village to explain the Land Law to the middle peasants. After hearing this, wealthy middle peasant Liu Shuxin boldly said: \"Ha! So that's how it is, I'm not afraid anymore. When I first heard about equal distribution, I thought it was our turn, that I was about to be eliminated. I had no choice, I was going to sell my little donkey and buy some white flour and meat to eat and run away with my mother. Tonight, after listening to the Land Law, I can rest assured. My idea was wrong, I want to work hard and gather firewood.\" At the meeting of middle and poor peasants in Sunjiazhuang, Xiangyuan, some middle peasants had the idea of being afraid of being struggled against. The poor and hired peasants then proposed: \"We are not struggling against 'having', but against exploitation. Labor and feudalism cannot be confused. Middle peasants are also laborers who are exploited. It is also a matter of consultation for upper-middle peasants to take out some surplus land, it is definitely not a struggle, and floating wealth will not be touched at all.\" After discussion, the middle peasants felt at ease. Liu Erhai, a middle peasant in Xicun, Sixth District of Licheng, heard about equal distribution and thought that everything would be messed up and distributed in baskets and baskets on the street, so he began to waste a lot. After the explanation by the poor and hired peasants, he said very emotionally: \"I was too confused, thanks to you for saying it early, otherwise I would have fallen into the pit.\" Wang Shengtian's mother in Licheng heard that she could not participate in the hired and poor peasant group and was also afraid. After studying the Land Law, she was happy to know that a new peasant association would be established. Other middle peasants were also particularly happy to hear this. After the joint discussion of the Land Law by middle and poor peasants in Guozhuang, She County, middle peasant Shu Lan said: \"Chairman Mao is afraid that we poor people will not have a good life, and all his good intentions are used on us. If we waste the fruits and don't have a good life, and our bodies are not turned over, we will be sorry for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.\" Since then, the wasteful phenomenon in the village has quickly stopped. Some expressed great regret for the things that had been wasted. After understanding the Land Law, an old middle peasant in Dagang Village said: \"I was wrong in the past, and letting my child stop transportation has already earned less money. If I don't hurry up, I can't make up for it.\" Then he told his child to engage in transportation again.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黎城等地以贫雇为核心  向中农宣传土地法  涉县郭庄浪费现象很快停止\n\n1948-02-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    黎城等地以贫雇为核心\n    向中农宣传土地法\n    涉县郭庄浪费现象很快停止\n    【太行消息】黎城等地许多区村，以贫雇为核心、联合中农，召开贫中农会或一家人座谈会，深入讨论土地法的精神，对稳定中农、团结全体农民起了很大的作用。土地法刚公布时，有的中农没有了解，地主富农又造谣、破坏，一部分中农特别是富裕中农，产生了恐慌不安及浪费不生产的现象。各地领导上发觉了这些问题，便及时提出：除深入贫雇宣传外，还必须加强对中农的宣传，让中农也普遍的了解土地法，使全体农民一致起来，彻底实现平分。在黎城二、四、六区及涉县、武乡、壶关、平顺某些村子，先后举行了贫中农座谈会及一家人会。首先在贫雇研究土地法时讨论了团结中农，然后在一家人会上向中农解释土地法，发动中农谈心，排除误解，使中农真正了解平分与自己的关系。涉县六区陡贡村贫雇会上，明确的提出：要彻底消灭封建，把平分作好，除贫雇领导干以外，必须团结中农。贫农刘书科说：“咱既要掌权作主，就得细心点，决不说横理，把事办好，地主封建一点也不让他混过去，另外，可不能打到咱们自己人头上。”刘金才补充说：“咱必须记住坚决团结中农。”贫雇讨论以后，便在村内召开中贫农会，向中农讲解了土地法。富裕中农刘书心听了后，大胆的说：“哈！原来是这样呀，我这就不害怕了。开头听说平分，我想这下可轮到咱头上来了，快要消灭我，我没办法啦，准备把俺那个小驴卖了，买些白面肉吃吃，往外走他娘呀。今天黑夜我听了土地法，这可放心了。我那想法不对，我要好好拾砍。”襄垣孙家庄中贫农会上，有些中农存在着怕挨斗争的思想，贫雇便提出：“咱不是斗‘有’，是要斗剥削的。劳动和封建不能混起来。中农也是劳动人，受剥削的，上中农往出拿些多余土地也是商量着办，绝不是斗争，浮财根本不动”。经过讨论，中农的心安下来。黎城六区西村中农刘二孩，听到平分，认为一齐打乱，拿在大街上一筐一篮的平分，便大浪费起来。后经贫雇解释，他很感动的说：“我太糊涂了，多亏你们说的早，要不是我就跌到坑里了”。黎城王生田妈听说自己不能参加雇贫小组，也害了怕。在研究土地法后，知道还要成立新农会，也高兴了。其他中农听了这一点也特别的欢喜。涉县郭庄在中贫农联合讨论土地法后，中农书兰说：“毛主席光怕咱穷人的时光过不好，一盘好心都用在咱身上了。咱要浪费果实，时光过不好，身翻不透，对不住共产党毛主席”。从此很快的停止了村内的浪费现象。有的对已浪费的东西表示很大惋惜。大港村老中农了解了土地法后，说：“过去我错了，让俺孩停下运输已经少赚了不少钱，不再赶赶可补不起来了。”随后便又叫他孩子搞运输去。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-11",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[This news dispatch] Central Bureau-affiliated cultural work units, including the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Cultural Work Troupe, Xinhua Bookstore, People's Daily, and Xinhua General Branch and sub-branches (excluding Handan Broadcasting Station, which has not yet concluded), have now completed the initial alignment of ranks after two months of rectification. A total of 450 people participated, with landlords, rich peasants, and bourgeois elements accounting for over 80%. Regardless of class background or ideological composition, they exhibited extreme impurity.\n\nThis cultural sector alignment was conducted under the guidance of the spirit of the Land Conference in the entire region, experiencing a severely painful struggle to cut off the tail. Initially, many people believed that land reform had no direct connection to them. Some had families in the KMT-controlled areas and appeared to have no concerns on the surface. Some had remained indifferent to land reform for the past year, adopting a so-called \"objective\" attitude. A portion of journalists engaged in reporting practical work held a \"good enough\" mentality, feeling that the reporting over the past year had been pretty good, and \"reviewing is for the comrades below.\" All of the above ideas became burdens during the study, and initially everyone was watching, observing how others were rectifying. After the proposal to rectify the Party ranks in the cultural sector, many comrades picked up the \"May Fourth Directive,\" complaining that they hadn't studied it properly in the past, while dogmatically debating \"what is a rich peasant\" and \"why isn't land nationalization being implemented now?\" Some comrades displayed utter leftist empty talk, thinking that \"as early as 1942, they felt the policy was somewhat rightist,\" and even felt that today's thorough equal distribution policy was not satisfying enough, and that implementing land nationalization would be considered \"correct.\" Some comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds began to consider personal family matters, such as how to handle their landlord wives, etc. Some couldn't lift their heads, and their ideological situation began to shift from static to chaotic.\n\nIn mid-November, leading comrades called on everyone in the cultural sector, without exception, to get into the water, expressing the Party's utmost determination to rectify the ranks and transform the cultural sector to adapt to thorough equal distribution, pointing out the characteristics of the cultural sector's rank rectification, which should start with ideologically demarcating class boundaries and gradually shedding burdens. Then, the study attitude was examined, and the group automatically stipulated study discipline, sweeping away the cultural figures' free and undisciplined habits.\n\nThrough group-based fragmentary self-reflection, some people discovered that what they had previously thought was \"no attitude\" or \"no thought\" towards land reform was actually \"having an attitude\" and \"having thoughts.\" For example, the report on Zhai Shixian's land donation, from a motive perspective, was to publish a beautiful news item, but in reality, it poured cold water on the struggle of the peasants in Boyan and supported the landlords. Some music workers held their cellos every day, infatuated with Beethoven and other classical masterpieces, completely neglecting to play and sing for the peasants and for land reform, instead using the excuse that they couldn't go to the countryside with their cellos to escape reality. A worker who introduced natural science knowledge thought that natural science had no class nature. In one place, landlords used the sun turning red to spread rumors of \"a bloody disaster in the liberated areas.\" When the peasants asked him to refute it, he used scientific principles of light and heat to give a dogmatic explanation, completely failing to stand on the side of the peasants to fight. Unable to stand the peasants' struggle, he quietly hid behind scientific knowledge, concealing his face of sympathy for the landlords. Some painting and woodcut workers believed that their works were intended to be exhibited abroad, not for the peasants to see. Therefore, their works were not based on the peasants' preferences. Both politically and technically, they catered to the standards of the foreign bourgeoisie, or prepared to \"be remembered for generations\" in Shanghai and Peiping. Writers feared eating the people's food, considering it a hardship, feeling that there was no way to cooperate with the peasants' struggle, requesting the Party to give them three to seven years of sufficient time and abundant material treatment before they could talk about producing \"works,\" and that even if these works were not appreciated by this generation, they could be left to future generations. After these thoughts were unearthed, most comrades realized that the ranks were impure and began to be honest, but then became entangled in the hat of petty-bourgeois ideology, thinking that petty-bourgeois ideology was less sinful than landlord ideology. There was no ideological exchange, and therefore they dared not truly stand on the class position to recognize the class roots of their mistakes, further excavating their errors, and the ideological movement became deadlocked.\n\nAfter the leading comrades called for \"clarifying class nature\" from personal words and deeds, the movement moved forward, forming a systematic examination of work and a systematic personal reflection.\n\nThe errors and weaknesses exposed in the work inspection surprised everyone. From the lines of the newspaper and the hidden thoughts of individuals, years of unthoroughly liquidated surrenderism to big landlords and big bourgeoisie and to landlords were unearthed. For example, in the early stages of land reform, without the approval of the Central Bureau, one-sided and simple advocacy of land donation news was carried out. In the early days of the patriotic self-defense war, surrenderist thinking of uniting landlords against Chiang occurred again. In the past year, whenever a movement came to an end, the newspaper would show complacency and a \"good enough\" mentality, affecting the in-depth development of the movement. The second was the rush-ahead and know-it-all style: news became a \"treasure chest,\" you want anything, I have anything, developing speculative thinking. During the war, war reports were rushed out regardless of military needs. Immersing oneself in nationwide external publicity, not being ashamed of the know-it-all style but taking pride in it. Two or three villages in Jinnan being re-examined could be written as \"re-examination sweeps through Jinnan,\" and the liquidation by peasants in several villages in Jin-Lu-Yu could be written as \"500,000 people are drawn into the struggle.\" The worst kind of know-it-all is closely combined with landlord and rich peasant thinking. One editor, reflecting on his use of the know-it-all method to handle an article that actually praised the landlord, was, in the depths of his mind, being directed by his landlord grandfather. Another gain from the newspaper inspection was the systematic exposure of the bourgeois influence on the work of the supplement, only wanting to show off the bourgeoisie's \"cultural level,\" frightening the \"country bumpkin\" prisoners, not serving land reform. For example, connecting with the masses was learned from an old novelist's method of \"giving the masses whatever they want,\" and as a result, many were thinking of ways for the landlords. A landlord element who had not bowed to the peasants asked: \"Can individuals make progress?\" The supplement editor did not sternly make him bow to the peasants to atone for his sins, but instead allowed the landlord to take advantage of the loophole. As for the manuscript about whether a son sold in poverty during a famine year could be brought back, it was inexcusably suppressed.\n\nXinhua Bookstore, as the Party and people's publishing organ, did not serve land reform for a long time. They believed that enterprise and the completion of political tasks were opposed, thus forming a purely business-oriented viewpoint, even unconsciously selling some toxic books published in the KMT-controlled areas. According to their review, they only began to realize the need to consciously cooperate with land reform during the Three Check-ups. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles criticized the bourgeois literary viewpoint, the most important point being not facing reality, not treating literature as a powerful weapon for the struggle of the people in the liberated areas. One comrade put on the airs of an old writer, reaching out everywhere, wanting care and status. He resisted to the end during this Party rectification study, and was severely criticized by everyone, educating everyone: only old writers who are dedicated to the people's cause and infinitely loyal to the Party are valuable; all careerists are bound to fail. Why hasn't land reform produced good works in a year? The correct answer was also found this time. Many comrades were reluctant to share weal and woe with the peasants, writing works needed for their struggle, fantasizing about great works, and haggling over personal gains and losses. The Cultural Work Troupe criticized the supremacy of art and surrenderism. Every comrade found that their disregard for politics, the supremacy of technique, and expert thinking had caused great losses to the Party's cultural work. Most comrades found that they had been in the Party for many years, never consciously working as a hired hand for the people, and felt very heavy-hearted, determined to correct their mistakes. Many comrades wept bitterly, unable to sleep, reflecting all night.\n\nWork Inspection Exposes Errors, Self-criticism Gradually Deepens\n\nThe inspection exposed the severity of the various shortcomings in the work, and even the most dishonest people were speechless. On this basis, it was relatively smooth to dig out the roots of the class and seek the historical ideological roots of consistently making mistakes. Generally, it can be divided into the following ideological types:\n\nThe first is the \"sense of justice\" of the landlord-gentry class, unable to stand the struggle against landlords, considering it \"personal humiliation,\" believing that revolution is a road, a burden, and that landlords can also walk and bear it without changing their stance. He does not let landlord youths betray their class, but instead fantasizes about them bringing glory to their class and letting out a sigh of relief to prove that they can be revolutionary. During the Party rectification, he also believed that impurity within the Party was not manifested in landlord and rich peasant thinking, but in some people only knowing how to follow the leaders in a chaotic manner, which he believed was a peasant habit that should be eliminated. This kind of person appears to be an enlightened landlord on the surface, thinking he has \"cleanliness fetish,\" sometimes deliberately appearing fair, verbally supporting land reform, but in reality, not only is he passively working, but he also resists everywhere in his work. Some took advantage of the know-it-all style to describe their family's land donation as very revolutionary. Some didn't teach to transform landlord youths, but instead specialized in finding smart and handsome people among the landlords, cherishing them doubly, and having aversion and rejection towards peasant children. Some associated their own parents with the struggle against landlords, thus affecting their work mood.\n\nThe second is a strong bourgeois concept and consciousness, considering themselves \"city sons,\" unfamiliar with the countryside (actually willingly acting as a bourgeois son resisting land reform). Their view of the city and the countryside is not to regard the countryside as the starting point and advancing base of revolution and revolutionary art, but rather \"my loudspeaker cannot be used now, but when I get to Shanghai in the future, I can compare with the Municipal Council Orchestra,\" as if not doing so would make the liberated area seem too countrified? This kind of person is in the countryside but their heart is in the city. They are constantly thinking about \"returning to the city in silk clothes\" to compete with the bourgeoisie: \"You have it, I have it too.\" Their view of the relationship between art and politics is not that art should serve politics, serve the peasant's emancipation through land reform, but rather \"the peasant's emancipation has nothing to do with me. If you are emancipated, I will paint you happy. If you are not emancipated, I will paint you oppressed.\" He considers art to be free from all control, but what he actually shows is pure surrenderism. For example, some comrades in the Cultural Work Troupe, when working at ×××, changed the songs supporting Chairman Mao to songs supporting ×××, even considering it a \"legal struggle.\" In terms of improving and popularizing: he does not improve people's art on the basis of what the peasants like to see and hear, but emphasizes \"learning technology.\" This enthusiasm for learning technology is because he is afraid of \"being eliminated when he enters the big city.\" He believes that \"not improving is tailism\" (bourgeois tailism), so he works hard every day to catch up with the bourgeoisie. This utter surrenderist thought is dominated by a wrong viewpoint, which is that \"the people's art of the liberated area is not as good as the bourgeois things outside,\" and \"the liberated area will not produce good art,\" thus giving rise to the thinking of keeping up with the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe third is the combination of petty-bourgeois thought and landlord-rich peasant thought: This reflection found that \"becoming famous thinking\" is prevalent among cultural workers. Not serving the people, but everything is for expressing oneself. This is a major source of individualism, impatience, rushing ahead, and a know-it-all style. For example, the liberation area's emancipated peasants joining the army is such a magnificent scene, with so many moving heroic deeds, but he ignores it, instead thinking of reporting on their participation in the war from those few landlords who have not completely surrendered to the peasants and are not so enthusiastic about the people's war. He praised landlords in the newspaper several times, such as praising Yang Geda for his meritorious service in carrying a stretcher, and praising Liaocheng landlords for participating in the war. When producing, he did not write about the efforts of the emancipated peasants in cultivating their own land, but also praised those landlords who were not in high spirits for production at the time. The new atmosphere in Shengfotang, Weixian County, was not a scene of emancipated peasants, but a description of landlords eating white flour and living a good life every day. Reporting on \"cultivating three acres and having one acre left over\" every day, but forgetting that the poor and hired laborers are still living a miserable life. This kind of petty-bourgeois thinking completely proceeds from personal plans. In order to show off and cater to people's curiosity, it produced the low-level sensationalism of \"man bites dog.\" They believed that peasants' production and participation in the war were not surprising, and that landlords' production and participation in the war were new.\n\nThe Combination of Petty-Bourgeois Thought and Landlord-Rich Peasant Thought is Most Harmful\n\nThere are also some newly arrived urban intellectuals who consider themselves revolutionaries, but when they saw the landlords fleeing from northern Jiangsu in Nanjing, they became suspicious of the Party, so they came to the liberated area with an attitude of investigation, watching the mass struggle coldly from the sidelines, the more they watched, the more excessive it became, the more they watched, the more disappointed they became. They believed this was \"objectivism\" thinking. Comrades with this kind of thinking are actually not objective. Some of them shed a few tears of sympathy for the landlords in the peasant struggle, and others resisted showing the great people's power in land reform, saying \"I can't see it.\" Facts have proved that all that they could see were things that took care of the landlords and praised the landlords.\n\nThe fourth is the landlord elements who sneaked in. One landlord in the Cultural Work Troupe felt that he had suffered a loss from paying public grain, so he mixed into the revolutionary ranks in order to \"eat back a portion\" to \"make up for his losses\" (actually to sabotage). Some wrote lists of scores to be settled and hid themselves when coming to the revolutionary camp. These people all exposed their true colors in the movement.\n\nIn addition, there are hooligan speculative thinking, degeneration thinking, etc., which will not be listed in detail. It must be pointed out that this kind of class examination is still the first time in various cultural departments in the border area. Everyone gradually learned to use the weapon of class nature to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism. In the examination, efforts were made to oppose the petty-bourgeois sentimentality, tactics, and the inferiority of fearing and evading struggle. At the same time, it advocated building a new self and opposing left-leaning one-sided exaggeration. The movement moved forward smoothly.\n\nUnder the full ideological movement, the question of checking class and checking work style was raised. Everyone drew a picture of their own class and looked in the mirror with documents such as Anti-Liberalism. In checking the class, everyone suddenly realized that the root of evil was that they had not truly betrayed their original class. One comrade who had been a revolutionary for ten years still followed his father's parting instructions to follow the Party, and a comrade from a landlord family who collected 3,000 piculs of rent still felt that his parents were also \"oppressed.\" Everyone compared some viewpoints brought from the original class with some erroneous thoughts in the revolutionary camp, and truly found the old root. In checking the work style, everyone further found the root cause of the long-term disputes, long-term inconsistency with the leadership, and the failure to implement the policy, and found that liberalism, reconciliationism, and sectarianism had become the refuge of the old class thinking. It took advantage of loopholes such as \"taking care,\" \"democracy,\" and \"preferential treatment for cultural figures,\" causing all kinds of unprincipled disputes and hindering the Party and comrades from considering work improvement from the class more. In the past, the newspaper office, which was always considered to have a relatively sound organization, cleared up the anti-Party and anti-leadership caused by personal fame and status, and caused extreme sectarianism and liberalism. One veteran comrade who had been in the Party for more than 20 years, with the help of everyone and personal reflection, found that his exploitative consciousness brought from his landlord family had basically not changed, and he had been causing trouble over fame and status for a long time, sowing discord within the Party, and carrying out sectarian activities. It caused discord between superiors and subordinates, affected Party unity, and carried out serious anti-Party and anti-leadership activities. As a result, during the year of vigorous land reform, the Party's policy could not be well implemented.\n\nIdeological struggle developed to a climax. Comrades who made mistakes expressed deep repentance, determined to reform, and asked the Party to give them strict punishment as a supervision of future actions. The result of this organizational rectification: a total of 31 people were punished; Du Shijia and 4 others were expelled, and 3 landlord elements who did not change their ways were cleaned up (one of whom was a big tyrant).\n\nAt the end of the cultural sector's rank rectification, the leading comrade pointed out: This study is only the beginning of our further transformation. We must fully recognize the tenacity of petty-bourgeois thinking. The achievements of this study are still extremely unconsolidated. Recalling the 1942 rectification movement, it did achieve considerable results at the time. However, before long, some people took advantage of loopholes such as \"unifying thinking,\" \"taking care,\" and \"democracy,\" causing more serious liberalism and sectarianism. This lesson must be deeply remembered. In the future, we must carry forward criticism and self-criticism, strictly adhere to organizational life, and in the future, we must rectify regularly, constantly rectify, wash our faces every day, go deep into the masses, and seek better training and transformation.\n\nNew Atmosphere After Going to the Countryside, Continue to Transform in the Struggle\n\nNow, in addition to leaving twice the number of comrades to persist in their posts, nearly 300 people have carried their luggage on their backs and gone to rural areas in Taihang, Jinnan, and Jin-Lu-Yu with working groups to participate in the reorganization of the ranks and the thorough equal distribution. More than half a month of experience has proved that every comrade has undergone a more significant transformation. They are not afraid of hardship and cold, and live with the poor and hired laborers. One young lady who had just come from the KMT-controlled area and had been spoiled since childhood lived with the peasants this time and felt that she had to \"grit her teeth and train.\" The class feelings and lifestyles of most comrades have undergone preliminary changes, and their emotions are high. They are unwilling to stop the investigation work even when the masses celebrate the New Year. Everyone is determined to let the people make an appraisal of them in the struggle.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中直文化部门整党结束  认真站队严整队伍  历来好闹纠纷原来是阶级界限不清\n\n1948-02-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中直文化部门整党结束\n    认真站队严整队伍\n    历来好闹纠纷原来是阶级界限不清\n    初步反省，发现不纯，低下头来\n    【本报消息】中央局直属各文化工作单位：边区文联，文工团，新华书店，人民日报及新华总分社等机关（缺邯郸广播电台，现尚未结束），经过两个月的整顿队伍，现在初步站队完毕。此次参加人共四百五十名，地主富农及资产阶级成份占百分之八十以上，无论阶级成份，思想成份均表现了十分的不纯洁。\n    这一次文化界站队，是在全区土地会议精神引导下进行的，经历了严重的痛苦的割尾巴斗争。开始的时候，不少人认为土地改革与自己没有直接关连，有的家在蒋管区，表面看来并无牵挂。有的一年来对土地改革可以说是不闻不问，抱着所谓“客观”的态度，一部分从事报导实际工作的新闻工作者则抱着“差不多”思想，觉得一年来报导得都还不错，“检讨是下边同志的事”，自己是来学习锻炼。以上种种思想在学习中成了包袱，起初都是观望，看着人家整。提出整顿文化界党的队伍后，不少同志拿上“五四指示”，一面抱怨过去没好好研究，一面教条主义的争论一阵“什么是富农”，“为什么现在不实行土地国有”？其中有的同志表现了十足的左倾空谈，自以为“早在四二年就觉得政策有些右”，甚至觉得今天彻底平分政策不过瘾，实行土地国有才算“正确”。一些地主富农出身的同志则开始考虑个人家庭、地主老婆应如何处理等问题，有些抬不起头来，思想情况开始从静止转入混乱。\n    十一月中旬，领导同志号召文化界每一个人毫无例外的下水，表明党整顿队伍改造文化界适应彻底平分的最大决心，指出文化界整顿队伍的特点，要从思想上划清阶级界限入手，逐步卸下包袱。接着检查学习态度，小组自动规定了学习纪律，一扫文化人自由散漫的习气。\n    经过小组片段反省，有些人发现过去自以为对土地改革“没态度”、“没思想”，实际上是“有态度”、“有思想”，象翟士贤献田的报导，从动机上看是为了发一条漂亮新闻，实际上却给伯延农民斗争泼了冷水，替地主撑了腰。有的音乐工作者天天抱着大提琴迷恋裴多汶等古典名曲，根本不去为农民为土地改革而弹唱，反而借口带上大提琴不能下乡来逃避现实。一位介绍自然科学知识的工作者自以为自然科学没有阶级性，有个地方，地主利用太阳发红造谣“解放区有血光之灾”，农民叫他驳斥，他却用光和热的科学原理作了教条解答，根本不站在农民方面进行战斗。他看不惯农民斗争，便悄悄隐蔽在科学常识背后，掩住自己对地主同情的面孔。有的绘画木刻工作者认为他的作品是要争取拿到外国去展览，不是给农民看的，因而他的作品不以农民喜爱为标准；无论是政治上与技巧上都是去迎合外国资产阶级水准，或是准备拿到上海北平去“流芳百世”。文学家怕吃老百姓的饭，引以为苦，觉得没办法配合农民斗争，要求党给以三年七年的充分时间，丰富的物质待遇，才能谈得上产生“作品”，而这种作品即使这一代不能为人赏识，却可以留给后代儿孙。这些思想挖出后，大部分同志才认识队伍不纯，开始老实了，但又纠缠在小资产阶级思想这顶帽子上，以为小资产阶级思想总比地主思想罪过轻些，思想上互不交锋，因而也就不敢真正站在阶级立场去认识错误的阶级根源，进一步发掘错误，思想运动呈现胶着状态。\n    领导同志号召从个人所言所行中“明确阶级性”后，运动向前发展一步，形成工作上系统的检查和个人的系统反省。\n    工作检查中暴露的错误和弱点使大家都吃了一惊。报纸方面从字里行间以及个人隐蔽思想中，挖出了几年未得到彻底清算的对大地主大资产阶级和对地主的投降主义，譬如土地改革初期未经中央局批准，即片面的单纯的鼓吹献田新闻。爱国自卫战争初期又发生了联合地主反蒋的投降主义思想。一年来每逢运动告一段落，报纸上便出现了自满情绪和差不多思想，影响运动走向深入。其次则为抢先和客里空作风：新闻成了“百宝囊”，你要什么，我有什么，发展了投机思想。战争时又不顾军事需要抢发战报。沉醉于全国性的对外宣传，对客里空作风不以为耻反以为荣。冀南二三个村复查就可以写成“冀南各地掀起复查”，冀鲁豫几个村庄的农民清算便可以写成“五十万人卷入斗争”。最坏的一种客里空是同地主、富农思想密切结合在一起，一位编辑同志反省他以客里空的手法，处理一篇实际上表扬了地主的稿件时，在思想深处，是被他的地主祖父指挥着的。报纸检查另一个收获，是系统的暴露了副刊工作上的资产阶级影响，只想卖弄资产阶级的“文化水”，吓唬俘虏“土豹子”，不去服务土地改革。譬如连系群众，却是从一个旧小说家那里学来的“群众要啥给啥”的办法，结果不少是替地主想了办法。一个没有向农民低头的地主分子询问：“个人能不能进步”？副刊编者没有严正的让他向农民低头赎罪，结果反而让地主钻了空子。至于灾荒年赤贫卖出的儿子能否领回的稿子，却被不可容恕的积压下了。\n    新华书店是党和人民的出版机关，很长时却没有服务土地改革，他们认为企业化和完成政治任务有对立，于是形成了单纯营业观点，甚至不自觉的贩卖了一些蒋管区出的有毒素的书籍。据他们检讨，真正有意识的配合土地改革还只是在三查才开始意识到。文联批判了资产阶级文学观点，最主要的一点是不面向现实，不把文学当作解放区农村人民斗争的一个有力武器。有位同志摆上老作家的牌子到处伸手，要照顾、要地位，这次整党学习中一直抵抗到底，受到大家严正批判，教育了大家：只有致力于人民事业，对党无限忠心的老作家才是可贵的，一切野心家都必然要失败。为什么一年土地改革产生不出好作品？这次也找到了正确的回答，不少同志留恋于机关的小家庭的享受，不愿同农民共甘苦，写他们斗争所需要的作品，幻想大作品，斤斤计较个人得失。文工团批判艺术至上主义、投降主义，每个同志都从工作中发现了自己的忽视政治，技巧至上，专家思想等错误思想给党的文化工作带来极大损失，大多数同志发现自己入党多年，从未有意识的当人民长工，心情十分沉重，决心痛改前非。不少同志痛哭流涕，睡不着觉，整夜反省。\n  工作检查暴露错误自我批判逐步深入\n    检查暴露了各种工作缺点的严重性，连最不老实的人也哑口无言了。在这一基础上，比较顺利地进行挖阶级的根子，寻求一贯犯错误的历史思想根源。大体上可以分成下列几种思想类型：\n    第一种是地主士大夫阶级的“正义感”，看不惯斗争地主，认为是“人格污辱”，认为革命是一条路，一付担子，地主不改变自己的立场也可以走也可以担。他不是让地主青年叛变自己阶级，反而是幻想他们为自己阶级争光，出口气，以证明自己可以革命。在整党中，还认为党内不纯不表现在地富思想，而是有些人只会跟着上级乱哄哄，他认为这是农民习气应该消除。这种人表面上象个开明地主，认为自己有“洁癖”，有时故意显得自己公正，口头上是拥护土地改革，实际上在工作中不但是消极的工作，而且处处表现抵抗。有的钻了客里空的空子，把自己家里献田描写得十分革命。有的教书不是改造地主青年，而是专在地主中找聪明俊秀的人，倍加爱惜，对农民子弟则有厌恶排斥情绪。有的看到斗争地主便联想到自己的父母，因而影响了工作情绪。\n    第二种是浓厚的资产阶级观念意识，自以为是“城市儿子”，对农村不熟悉（实际上是甘当资产阶级儿子抵抗土地改革）。他们对城市和乡村的看法，不是把农村当作革命和革命艺术的出发点、前进阵地，而是“我的大喇叭现在不能用，将来到了上海还可以和工部局乐队看齐”，似乎不这样岂不显得解放区有点太土豹子了吗？这种人身在农村心在城市，他们天天念念不忘的是“衣锦进城”去和资产阶级比赛：“你有我也有”。他们对艺术与政治关系的看法，不是艺术服从政治，服从土地改革农民翻身，而是“农民翻身与我无干，你翻身我就画你高兴，你不翻身我就画你受压迫”。他自以为艺术是可以不受一切支配，实际上表现出来的却是道地的投降主义。譬如文工团有些同志在×××处工作时把拥护毛主席的歌子换成拥护×××来唱，还认为是“合法斗争”。在提高与普及上：他不是在农民喜闻乐见的基础上来提高人民艺术，而是强调“学习技术”，这种学习技术的热忱，是因为怕“进了大城市会被淘汰”。他认为“不提高就是尾巴主义”（资产阶级的尾巴主义），于是天天努力于向资产阶级迎头赶上。这种十足的投降主义思想，有一个错误观点支配着，这就是“解放区的人民艺术比不上外边资产阶级的东西”，“解放区不会出产好的艺术”，因而发生了向资产阶级看齐思想。\n    第三种是小资产思想与地富思想的结合：这次反省发现文化工作者中普遍地存在着“成名思想”。不是为人民服务，而是一切为了表现自己。这是个人主义、急性病、抢先、客里空作风的一个主要来源。譬如解放区翻身农民参战，是多么雄伟壮观的场面，有着多少可歌可泣的英雄事迹，然而他却不理睬，反而从那些并没有完全向农民屈服，对人民战争并没有那样热情的少数地主身上，想出了报导他们参战的题材。在报上几次表扬地主，如表扬杨圪旦抬担架立功，表扬聊城地主参战。生产的时候不写翻身农民在自己的土地上的努力耕作，也同样表扬那些事实上在当时生产情绪并不高的地主。写威县圣佛堂新气象不是翻身农民的景象，而是描写地主天天吃白面过好生活。天天报导耕三余一，却忘记了贫雇仍在过着悲惨生活。这种小资产阶级思想完全从个人打算出发，为了出风头，迎合人们好奇心，便产生了“人咬狗”的低级趣味主义，他们认为农民生产参战不足为奇，地主生产参战才是新鲜的。\n  小资产阶级思想同地主富农思想结合危害最大\n    也有些新来的城市知识分子，自以为是革命家，可是在南京看到苏北逃亡地主就对党有了怀疑，于是抱着考查的态度来解放区，在一旁冷眼看群众斗争，越看越过火，越看越失望。他们认为这是“客观主义”思想。有这样思想的同志其实并不客观的，其中有的在农民斗争中给地主撒下了几滴同情之泪，还有的抵抗表现土地改革中伟大的人民力量，说是“看不见”。事实证明了凡是被他们看得见的都是照顾地主，表扬地主的东西。\n    第四种则为混进来的地主分子，文工团有一个地主是因缴公粮认为吃了亏，混到革命队伍中，为了“吃回一份”来“捞本”的（实际上是破坏），有的写了变天帐来到革命阵营中隐藏了自己。这些人均在运动中暴露了自己的真面目。\n    此外还有流氓投机思想、蜕化思想等都不细举。必须指出这样的从阶级检查在边区各个文化部门还是第一次，大家逐渐学会运用阶级性的武器进行自我批判和相互批判。在检查中着力反对小资产阶级的温情主义，要手法，畏惧逃避斗争等劣根性，同时提倡建设新我，反对左倾片面的夸大狂，运动一往直前顺利发展。\n    在思想运动饱满情况下，提出了查阶级查作风，每个人都给自己画了一个阶级的像，拿反自由主义等文件照了照镜子。在查阶级中大家才恍然大悟原来孽根就是自己没有真正叛变自己的原阶级。一位同志革命十年仍然遵循父亲临别的嘱托来跟党闹，一位出身收三千石租子的地主家庭的同志还认为自己父母也受人“压迫”，大家把原阶级带来的一些观点和在革命阵营中一些错误思想加以对照，真正找到了老根。查作风中，大家进一步找到过去长期闹纠纷，长期同领导上不一致，使方针无法贯彻的根本原因，发现自由主义、调和主义、宗派主义成了旧阶级思想的避难所。它钻了“照顾”、“民主”、“优待文化人”等空子，闹起各色各样无原则纠纷，妨碍了党和同志更多的从阶级上考虑工作改进工作。过去一向认为组织比较健全的报馆，这次清算了由于个人闹名誉、闹地位而形成的反党反领导，闹了极大的宗派主义、自由主义。一位入党二十余年的老同志，经过大家帮助及个人反省，发现自己从地主家庭带来的剥削意识基本未变，长期的闹名誉地位，在党内挑拨是非，进行宗派活动。引起上下不和，影响党内团结，进行了严重的反党反领导。以致在一年轰轰烈烈土地改革运动中，使党的方针不能很好贯彻。\n    思想斗争发展到了高潮，犯了错误的同志们，沉痛表示忏悔，决心改过，并要求党给自己以严格处分，作为今后行动的监督。这次组织整顿结果：受处分者共三十一人；开除杜矢甲等五人，清洗了三个不改过的地主分子（其中有一个是大恶霸）。\n    在结束文化界整顿队伍时，领导同志指出：这次学习只是我们进一步改造的开始，必须充分认识小资产阶级思想的顽强性，这次学习成果仍是极其不巩固的。回忆四二年整风运动，当时确实获有相当成果的。可是为时不久，有些人却又钻了“打通思想”、“照顾”、“民主”等空子，闹起更严重的自由主义和宗派主义。这一教训必须深记，今后要发扬批评和自我批评，严格组织生活，以后要定期的整，不断的整，天天洗脸深入群众，求得更好的锻炼改造。\n  下乡后有新气象继续在斗争中改造\n    现除留有一倍分同志坚持岗位工作外，已有将近三百余人自背行李，随同工作团分赴太行、冀南、冀鲁豫各地农村参加整编队伍和彻底平分，半个多月的体验，证明每个同志均有较显著转变，他们不怕吃苦受冻，同贫雇生活在一起。一位新从蒋管区来，自小娇生惯养的小姐，这次同农民生活在一起，认为自己要“咬紧牙关锻炼一下”。大多数同志阶级情感、生活方式已有初步改变，情绪高涨，在群众过年时也不愿停止调查工作。大家都下定决心要在斗争中让人民给自己做一个鉴定。"

    "title": "Starting from “Yang Zhenqing’s Rebirth”",
    "author": "Xin Shen",
    "date": "1948-02-11",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Starting from “Yang Zhenqing’s Rebirth”\nXin Shen\n\nTwo years ago, I once adapted an article by Comrade Wang Genliu, entitled \"Yang Zhenqing's Rebirth,\" which was published in the People's Daily on September 7, 1946. The gist of the article was: \"The people of Dinanbao, Handan, won the ideological struggle against the landlord Yang Zhenqing.\" Yang Zhenqing was one of the most famous landlords in Handan. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had been a lawyer, county magistrate, and provincial assemblyman. When the enemy arrived in Handan, he became the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. The masses complained to him, but without breaking down his landlord status economically or politically, he quickly \"reborn.\" And he said with great emotion: \"After decades of running around, I finally found the path of life thanks to the guidance of the masses. Although I am in my sixties, I am determined to follow the people with all my heart.\"… The article used a great deal of space to explain that he was an insightful and \"just\" \"enlightened\" landlord, while the just actions of the mass struggle were only written in a mere two hundred words.\n\nAdapting this article took some effort. I wanted to show the greatness of the masses' power in this article, so that even such a big landlord was subdued. I also wanted to explain that even landlords could \"sincerely and willingly\" accept land reform, then, wouldn't land reform be more in line with \"heavenly principles and human feelings\"? I emphasized the latter point and deleted certain parts of the mass struggle.\n\nDuring the process of reorganizing the ranks, I reflected on my landlord thoughts and feelings, as well as the \"paper-shuffling\" style of work. After studying this article again, I found that it was a product of the combination of landlord thought and a \"paper-shuffling\" style of work.\n\nAt the time, I believed that some landlords could be \"reasoned with\" without going through mass struggle, especially intellectuals, who could be more easily \"transformed.\" That is to say, I once felt that a portion of the landlords should be retained. That's why I wrote this piece. At that time, I seemed to have a \"basis\" for thinking this way, and this \"basis\" came from my grandfather.\n\nMy grandfather was a landlord and also engaged in commerce. He served as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in my county for many years, and later, as he got older, he let my father take over as chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. He was the first local tyrant in my county. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he went to live in Beiping. I estimated at the time that this was an expression of his national integrity. I thought that if he had been willing to be a traitor, he would surely have been the enemy's first favorite in my county. It was because he was unwilling to be a traitor that he went to Beiping to \"live in seclusion.\" When chatting with comrades, I often mentioned this matter. The implication was that I had such a good grandfather with national integrity; it seemed that my own face was also shining a bit. In fact, my father was still serving as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce at the time, sucking the blood and sweat of the peasants for the Japanese; my family became a large stone slab on the heads of the peasants. At that time, the Japanese occupied the city, and the People's Liberation Army was active in the countryside. Such a traitorous family would be punished by the people at any time. My grandfather saw this, so he handed over the task of oppressing and exploiting the peasants to my father, and took his concubine and the blood-stained money taken from the peasants to Beiping to live an obscene and shameless \"peaceful life.\" I myself, as the son of a landlord, defended them for many years.\n\nThis kind of thinking has a long history. I remember that there were many \"plaques\" hanging on the gate of my house. These were the lickspittles who came to flatter my grandfather, either forced by his power or attempting to curry favor. Inside, there was a plaque with four large characters: \"Saving the People from Water and Fire.\" Originally, my grandfather advocated the establishment of a \"Public Security Water Association\" (fire brigade) in my county, and he donated a considerable amount of money. This was considered \"saving\" the people from \"fire.\" He also advocated building a large stone bridge on both sides of the Puhe River west of the city, and he also donated more money than others. This was considered \"saving\" the people from \"water.\" So the plaque of saving the people from water and fire came out. This matter has long blinded me: repairing bridges and fighting fires, it seems that it is always a good thing. When studying, I carefully traced back to find that the means of exploitation of landlords (especially the kind of landlords like my grandfather who have power and influence) are sometimes very \"sophisticated.\" The busiest place in my county is Beiguan, and many of the houses in Beiguan are my grandfather's. Of course, he is most afraid of fire. So he came forward to \"advocate\" and took out a little money he had exploited, and then lured and forced others to take out more money to set up a \"Public Security Water Association.\" It was called saving everyone's fire, but in fact it was protecting his own house. Maybe he also tried to use this method to get a good reputation among some people. Building a stone bridge was because my family and my land were separated by the Puhe River. In the summer, when the water rose, it was impossible to pass at all. Building such a bridge with everyone's strength was beneficial to my family first. This is called being generous at the expense of others, making big money with small capital, which is a common trick used by landlords.\n\nBut I didn't think so in the past. I regarded his exploitation of peasants, shop assistants, and workers as normal (that is, a reasonable phenomenon), and regarded this \"clever\" method of exploitation as \"merit,\" and regarded some lickspittles' flattery and drilling as the peasants still having a \"not bad impression\" of him. Standing in the landlord's position and looking at the landlord, I even regarded the landlord's sins as good deeds. These despicable and dirty tricks of the landlords cannot deceive the peasants. The peasants are drained of their marrow by the landlords, and they hate and are ready to eliminate this enemy at any time. In the land reform, they have already risen to carry out this elimination work. However, the landlord class firmly passed on their position, thoughts, and viewpoints to me. When I rewrote \"Yang Zhenqing's Rebirth,\" in the depths of my mind, I was actually commanded by my grandfather. As a result, the peasants' struggle was lightly glossed over, and Yang Zhenqing was written as an enlightened gentry with vision and justice. When the peasants did not rise, the landlord class fiercely and barbarously oppressed the peasants. When the peasants had risen and wanted to eliminate the landlord class, it tried to disguise itself and evade in every possible way, trying to escape the revolutionary storm of the peasants. This is the landlord's conspiracy. In this matter, I played a role in lying for the landlord and deceiving the peasants. I have committed an irreparable sin.\n\nThis preliminary fragmentary reflection has made me further realize the danger of combining the \"paper-shuffling\" style of work with the landlord's position. The characteristic of \"paper-shuffling\" is to make something out of nothing, to make something small into something big, to distort the facts, and to exaggerate casually. For example, \"Yang Zhenqing's Rebirth\" wrongly emphasized his transformation and erased or weakened the mass struggle. The \"paper-shuffling\" style of work combined with the landlord's thought will fabricate falsehoods according to the landlord's requirements and format, although subjectively it may not have been that way at the time. I adapted this article in the hot weather, without even taking a nap, as if it was for work, as if it was quite hard. When studying, I checked myself and said that this article was a manifestation of landlord thought, and the comrades also said that this was a landlord's position. I said it all right in words, but I never admitted defeat in my heart. The reason was that my starting point was good, and it was not intentional to make a mistake. Later, after repeated thinking and the repeated help of comrades, I realized that my original landlord position had not changed. I was being controlled by it, and my view of the problem, my search for materials, and my estimation and judgment would all be biased. This is a natural result, and it is called class nature. This kind of nature is hidden and tenacious, so it is most harmful to the revolution. This layer of skin is the most difficult to peel off, because it is often wrapped in a \"good intention\" gold suit. I am willing to continue peeling off this layer of skin, until I dig out all the landlord's roots and completely eliminate them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 从“杨真卿的新生”说起\n辛深\n1948-02-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    从“杨真卿的新生”说起\n    辛深\n    前年，我曾经编改过王根六同志的一篇文章，题目叫作“杨真卿的新生”，登在四六年九月七日的人民日报上。这篇文章的大意是：“邯郸堤南堡群众向地主杨真卿的说理斗争胜利了。”杨真卿是邯郸有名大地主之一，抗战前当过律师、县长、省议员，敌人到了邯郸，当商会会长。群众向他诉了诉苦，还没有从经济上政治上把他的地主身份打垮，他很快就“新生”了。并且非常感慨的说：“几十年来的奔波，终赖群众的诱导找到了人生的道路。我年虽花甲，但本发短心长，一意跟着人民走。”……这篇文章用了很大的篇幅说明他是个有眼光、有“正义”的“开明”地主，而群众斗争的正义行动，却只写了寥寥二百多字。\n    改编这篇文章，很费了些气力。我想在这篇文章中显示群众力量的伟大，以致把这么个大地主都压服了。又想说明连地主都能够“心悦诚服”的接受土地改革，那么，土地改革不是更合乎“天理人情”么？我强调了后面这一点，删掉了群众斗争的某些部分。\n    在整编队伍的过程中，我反省了自己的地主思想情感，也反省了“客里空”作风，又一次研究了这篇文章，我发现它是地主思想和“客里空”作风结合的产品。\n    当时，我曾经认为有些地主不必经过群众斗争，就能够“以理喻之”，特别是读书人，更能够比较容易的求得“转变”。就是说，我曾经觉得有一部分地主是应该保留的。所以写了这篇东西。我当时这么想，似乎还有“根据”，而这种“根据”是从我祖父那里找来的。\n    我祖父是个地主，兼营商业。当过我县多年商会会长，以后年纪渐老，把商会会长让给我父亲。他是我县第一个豪绅，抗战以后，到北平去住了。我当时估计这是他有民族气节的表现，我认为他要愿意当汉奸，在我县保险是敌人第一个红人。他是因为不愿当汉奸，所以才到北平去“隐居”的。和同志们闲谈起来，常常说到这件事。言外之意，我有这么个有民族气节的好祖父；似乎自己脸上也跟着有了些光彩。实际上，我父亲当时还当着商会会长，替日本人吸吮农民的血汗；我的家庭成了农民头上的大石板。当时日本人占着城，人民解放军在四乡活动，这么个汉奸家庭，随时会受到人民的惩办。我祖父看到了这一点，所以才把压迫剥削农民的任务交给我父亲，自己带着小老婆和取自农民的血汗钱，到北平过荒淫无耻的“太平日子”。我自己以一个地主儿子的资格，替他们作了多年的辩护。\n    这种思想由来已久。记得我家的大门上，挂着许多“匾”。这是狗腿们或迫于淫威，或企图钻营，来拍我祖父马屁的。里面有一块写着四个大字“救民水火”。原来我祖父倡导着在我县建立了一个“保安水社”（消防队），他捐了相当多的钱，这算“救民”之“火”。又倡导在城西瀑河两岸建筑了一座大石桥，他也捐了较别人为多的钱，这算作“救民”之“水”。于是救民水火的匾就出来了。这件事长期蒙蔽着我：修桥救火，想来总算是件好事。学习时细细的追想一番，我终于发现地主（特别象我祖父那种有权有势的地主）的剥削手段有时是很“高妙”的。我县最热闹的地方在北关，北关有许多的房子是我祖父的，他当然最怕失火。于是出面“倡导”，自己拿出一点剥削来的钱，再诱骗强迫别人拿出更多的钱，成立起“保安水社”，名为救大家的火，实际在保护自己的房子。也许他还企图用这种方法，在某些人当中，落个好名声呢。建石桥，是因为我的家庭和我家的土地被瀑河隔开了，夏天水涨，根本不能通行。借大家的力量修这么个桥，有利的首先是我家。这叫慷他人之慨，下小本赚大钱，正是地主经常惯用的手法。\n    但我过去不是这么想。我是把他剥削农民、店员、工人的事情看作常态（就是合理的现象），把这种“高明”的剥削方法看成“功德”，把某些狗腿的吹捧钻营看成农民对他还“印象不坏。”我站在地主立场上看地主，竟把地主的罪恶也看成了好事。地主这些卑鄙龌龊的伎俩不可能骗过农民，农民被地主吸干膏血，他们痛恨并随时准备消灭这个敌人，在土地改革中，他们已经起来进行这个消灭的工作了。但是，地主阶级却把他们的立场、思想、观点牢固的传给了我，当我改写“杨真卿新生”的时候，在思想的深处，实际上是被我祖父指挥着的。于是，农民的斗争被轻轻带过去了，杨真卿被写成有见识有正义的开明士绅。地主阶级在农民没有起来的时候，凶狠野蛮的压迫农民，当农民既经起来，要消灭地主阶级的时候，它就想法伪装、多方躲闪，企图逃过农民的革命风暴。这是地主的阴谋。我在这件事情上，充当了一个替地主说谎的脚色，替他们欺骗了农民。造下难以补救的罪孽。\n    这个初步的片断反省，已经使我进一步认识到“客里空”作风和地主立场相结合的危险性。“客里空”的特点是将无说有，以小作大，歪曲事实，随便夸张，象“杨真卿新生”中就错误的强调了他的转变，抹杀或减弱了群众斗争。“客里空”作风和地主思想结合起来，就会按着地主的要求、格式去作假，虽然当时主观上也许还是并不怎么样的。我改编此文是在热天，午觉都没睡，好象还是为了工作，好象也还相当辛苦。学习时，自己检讨到此文是地主思想的表现，同志们也说这是地主立场，我口头全都说对，心上却总不认输，理由是我的出发点还好，不是有意弄错的。以后经过自己的反复思索及同志们再三帮助，我才认识到自己原来的地主立场没有变，自己被它左右着，看问题、找材料、估计判断都会偏了，这是自然而然的结果，这就叫作阶级天性。这种天性隐蔽而顽强，因此给革命的危害最大。这层皮揭开最难，因为它常常是被“好心”的金装包裹着的。我愿把这层皮继续揭下去，一直到把地主根性都挖出来，彻底消灭了为止。"

On the 3rd of this month, a certain unit of the military subdistrict and the Taigu Battalion penetrated deep behind enemy lines and ambushed the area of Sigua, Xinzhuang, and Huian, more than ten li southeast of Taigu. A small detachment was sent to Xincun to lure the enemy. On the morning of the 4th, two battalions, totaling over 700 men, of the 8th Column of Yan bandits stationed in Taigu City came out and advanced towards Sigua and Xinzhuang in three routes. After the enemy's vanguard entered our ambush zone, we immediately charged and killed them, completely wiping out an enemy infantry platoon. At this time, another unit of ours ambushed in Huian and Xinzhuang also attacked from behind the enemy, launching a two-pronged attack from inside and outside. The enemy was immediately thrown into disarray, dropping their heavy weapons in terror and fleeing back to Taigu City. At this time, more than 150 Yan bandit police corps from the city rushed to reinforce them, but upon seeing the unfavorable situation, they also turned around and fled. We pursued them fiercely until north of Huian, where the two defeated forces converged and counterattacked us three times, but were all defeated by us. In this battle, over 150 Yan bandits were killed or wounded, and 46 were captured alive. We seized two mortars, one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, twenty-five rifles, 3,487 rounds of various bullets, forty-seven artillery shells, fifteen bombs, two boxes of heavy machine gun parts, six pack mules, and many other items.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行二分区某部深入敌后  消灭阎匪二百\n\n1948-02-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行二分区某部深入敌后\n    消灭阎匪二百\n    【太行消息】二分区部队深入太谷敌后打了一个胜仗，消灭阎匪二百余名。本月三日，分区某部和太谷营兵深入敌后，埋伏在太谷东南的十多里四卦、新庄、慧奄一带，分出一小股部队，前进到新村引诱敌人。四号上午驻在太谷城的阎匪八纵队出来两个营共七百多人，分三路向四卦、新庄进犯。敌先头部队进入我伏击圈后，我即向敌冲杀，全部消灭了敌人一个步兵排。这时我埋伏在慧奄、新庄的另一部，也从敌人背后打过来，里外夹攻，敌人马上乱了阵营，吓得丢下重武器，扭头就向太谷城逃跑。这时城里阎匪保警队一百五十多人，赶来增援，一见势头不对，也扭头就跑，我随后猛追，至慧奄以北，两股败敌会合后向我反扑，冲了三次都被我打垮。这一仗，打死打伤阎匪一百五十多人，活捉四十六人。缴获迫击炮两门，重机枪一挺，轻机枪四挺，步枪二十五支，各种子弹三千四百八十七发，炮弹四十七发，炸弹十五个，重机枪零件两箱，驮骡六匹，及其他物件很多。"

    "content": "Taihang District Party Committee and Military Region Instruction\n    Launch Political Offensive to Publicize the Land Law\n    [Taihang News] The Taihang District Party Committee and the Political Department of the Taihang Military Region jointly issued instructions last month to vigorously launch a comprehensive political offensive centered on publicizing the Outline Land Law. The instructions stated: \"We must concentrate all the strength of the Party, government, army, and people in the border areas, penetrate deep into the enemy's heart, and launch a full-scale political offensive against the enemy to coordinate with the victorious operations of the southward counter-offensive army, to coordinate with the thorough realization of the Outline Land Law, and to more broadly develop guerrilla warfare in the border areas, in order to accelerate the collapse of the Chiang bandits. In the course of extensive propaganda, the current main task is to explain the Outline Land Law in detail, and to tell all personnel forced to participate in the Chiang side's work and their broad masses of soldiers that as long as they return quickly (within the time limit), they can equally share a portion of land and property, and can be sent home (those who voluntarily join the People's Liberation Army are even more welcome).\" The instructions also stated: \"In launching the political offensive, we must pay special attention to propaganda among the broad lower strata of local tyrants and puppet organizations, because they have a certain social foundation and are the claws of the Chiang army's regular troops, but we also have the confidence and conditions to strive to disintegrate them. Only by doing so can we more easily develop guerrilla warfare and carry out the equal distribution movement.\" In terms of methods, the instructions emphasized: \"We must hand over the weapon of this political offensive to the broad masses, so that everyone can think of ways and offer ideas, and universally launch a mass 'shouting for husband' and 'saving lives' competition movement, and combine land reform with the organization of poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations to carry out heart-winning warfare in an organized manner. Resolutely overcome the phenomenon of contradiction between this work and local mass movements in the past.\" The instructions concluded: \"All localities must seize the time before and after the old lunar New Year to quickly carry out the work, establish the idea of accumulating small victories into great victories, overcome the idea of eating big fish, and strive for one person and one gun, which is all good.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行区党委军区指示  开展政攻宣传土地法\n\n1948-02-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行区党委军区指示\n    开展政攻宣传土地法\n    【太行消息】太行区党委和太行军区政治部，在上月联合发出大力开展以宣传土地法大纲为中心的全面政治攻势指示。该指示说：“我们必须集中边地党政军民一切力量，深入到敌人心脏中去，全力开展对敌政治攻势，来配合南下反攻大军的胜利作战，配合土地法大纲的彻底实现，和更广泛的开展边地游击战争，以加速蒋匪崩溃过程。在广泛进行宣传中，目前主要是深入详细解释土地法大纲，并告诉一切被迫参加蒋方工作的人员及其广大士兵群众，只要赶快（限期）回来，就可以平分到一份土地财产，并可遣送回家（自愿参加解放军者更欢迎）。”该指示又说：“开展政治攻势中，我们要特别注意对土顽伪广大下层进行宣传，因为它有一定的社会基础，又是蒋军正规部队的爪牙，但我们也有信心有条件来争取瓦解他们。同时也只有这样作，才能更便利我们开展游击战争与进行平分运动。”在作法上，该指示着重说：“要把这一政治攻势的斗争武器交给广大群众，大家想办法、出主意，普遍开展一个群众性的‘叫子索夫’和‘救命’竞赛运动，并结合土改分田组织贫农团、农会，有组织的进行攻心战。坚决克服过去这一工作和地方群运矛盾的现象。”指示最后说：“各地要抓紧旧历年关前后，迅速进行，树立积小胜为大胜的思想，克服吃大鱼思想，争取一人一枪都是好的。”"

    "content": "Transforming Our Party Newspaper\nPeng Zhen\n\nOur Party newspaper is a newspaper that serves the people, and it is also one of the important tools for realizing the Party's leadership. It is a weapon for guiding the Party and the masses in their ideological struggle against all kinds of errors and hostile ideas both inside and outside the Party. It is an ideological weapon for fighting the enemy, and also a weapon for the Party's criticism and self-criticism. The Party's leading organs must pay close attention to the leadership of the newspaper. Every word and every article in the newspaper represents the Party's voice and must be able to represent the Party. It is not a liberal newspaper, or a \"natural expression\" of idle-class literati who have nothing to do after eating and write whatever comes to their minds. Every word and every sentence in it must be useful to the people and beneficial to the people; it must be a newspaper that is responsible to the people and to the Party. Every word and every sentence, from content to form, must be truly beneficial to the people before it can be published; otherwise, it must be resolutely corrected and discarded. Our newspapers and the personnel engaged in journalism should thoroughly transform and improve themselves according to this standard.\n\nAll personnel engaged in journalism must wholeheartedly serve the people, act as filial children to the people, and diligently understand and comprehend the demands, thoughts, feelings, and language of the people. Only in this way is it possible to run a good newspaper for the Party and the people. We must use this as the standard to select a group of good Party members, strengthen journalism work, and form a strong journalism team that can serve the war and also shoulder the task of leading land reform. Comrades at all levels engaged in practical work should regularly be responsible for writing articles for the Party newspaper. On the other hand, current journalism comrades should go deep into the masses, participate in land reform, and learn from the workers and peasants to firm up their class stand and viewpoint and thoroughly transform themselves. Only in this way can the newspaper be run well and can the empty, formalistic work style that pervades the border region, poisons the whole Party, and harms the country and the people be eradicated.\n\nThe editing form, writing style, and language style of the newspaper should all be subordinate to the above-mentioned political tasks and political and ideological content. It should adopt a common language and common forms with the masses, establish forms that are easy for the masses to grasp and are familiar to the masses, that is, the masses' own forms, popularized forms. We should study our editing techniques from this perspective so that technology can more effectively serve politics and scientifically express content, rather than blindly following or imitating bourgeois technology. Even more, we cannot edit the newspaper from a purely technical perspective. Because our Party is not a party of classless aesthetics, our newspaper is not a purely aesthetic newspaper, but a revolutionary fighting weapon.\n\nIn order to transform our work style and transform all work, we must carry out criticism and self-criticism. We must commend the good and criticize the bad. Commending the good is, at the same time, criticism of the bad.\n\nWhat is the purpose of commending or criticizing? It is to promote one thing and oppose another. Zhdanov, in his speech at the Soviet philosophical discussion meeting, pointed out that criticism and self-criticism are the driving force of the development of socialist society. There is no progress without the struggle of contradictions. The progress of our work is the same, and we must rely on criticism and self-criticism. We must adopt a serious attitude towards the errors and shortcomings in our work, expose and criticize them, and correct them. However, criticism and self-criticism are not simply exposure that discourages people, but are aimed at boosting morale, increasing confidence, and doing a good job. It is positive and must be positive. Only in this way will it not discourage people. Wasn't our land conference this time very critical? But we were not discouraged by this, but instead increased our confidence. Criticism should be in line with the facts, what should be negated, what should be affirmed, should be appropriate, and there must be active ways to improve. At the same time, we should not be afraid of being used by the enemy, that is, avoid abandoning criticism and self-criticism for fear of choking.\n\nOur criticism and self-criticism should also follow the mass line. To truly follow the mass line, we must boldly carry out criticism and self-criticism, thoroughly transform our work style, and thoroughly transform all our work. Our newspaper should become one of the weapons for promoting criticism and self-criticism.\n\n(A section of the conclusion at the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Land Conference on November 7, 1947) (Reprinted from Jin-Cha-Ji Daily)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 改造我们的党报\n彭真\n1948-02-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    改造我们的党报\n    彭真\n    我们的党报，是为人民服务的报纸，也是实现党的领导的重要工具之一，是指导党与群众的思想、与党内外一切错误及敌对思想作斗争的武器。是对敌斗争的思想武器，也是党的批评与自我批评的武器。党的领导机关，必须十分注意对于报纸的领导。报纸的每一句话，每一篇文章，都是代表党讲话的，必须是能够代表党的。它不是一个自由主义的报纸，或者是吃饱了饭无事干的、有闲阶级的文人们，想起什么写什么的“自然流露”。它的每一字、每一句都必须是对人民有用的和有利于人民的报纸，对人民对党负责的报纸。一字一句，从内容到形式，都必须是真正有利于人民的，才可以登载，与此相反的就必须坚决改正与抛弃。我们的报纸和从事新闻工作的人员，应该依此标准来加以彻底改造和提高。\n    必须使一切从事新闻工作的人员，全心全意为人民服务，为人民当孝顺儿女，勤勤恳恳地体贴与领会人民的要求、思想、感情和语言，这样才有可能为党与人民办一个好的报纸。当必须依此为标准，选择一批好的党员，加强新闻工作，组成一个能为战争服务、还能负担领导土地改革任务的坚强的新闻工作的队伍。各级从事实际工作的同志，应该经常负责为党报写稿。另一方面，现在的新闻工作同志，应该深入群众，参加土地改革，向工人农民群众学习，以坚定自己的阶级立场和观点，彻底改造自己。只有这样，才能把报纸办好，才能肃清目前弥漫边区、流毒全党、祸国殃民的客里空作风。\n    报纸的编辑形式、文风、语风，都应该服从于上述的政治任务和政治内容与思想内容，应该与群众采用共同的语言，共同的形式，树立为群众所容易掌握的和群众所熟悉的，即群众自己的形式，大众化的形式。应该以这样的观点研究我们的编辑技术，使技术更能有效地为政治服务，和科学地表现内容；而不是因袭或模仿资产阶级的技术。更不能以纯粹技术观点，来编辑报纸。因为我们的党不是无阶级立场的美术的党，我们的报纸也不是这样的一个纯美术的报纸，而是一个革命的战斗的武器。\n    为了改造我们的作风，改造一切工作，就必须开展批评与自我批评。要表扬好的，批评坏的。表扬好的，对于坏的同时就是批评。\n    表扬或批评是为了什么呢？是为了提倡一种东西和反对一种东西。日丹诺夫在苏联哲学讨论会上的发言，指出批评与自我批评是社会主义社会发展的动力。没有矛盾的斗争就没有进步，我们工作的进步，也是一样，要依靠批评与自我批评。我们对于工作中的错误和缺点，必须采取认真的态度，加以揭发批评和改正。但批评与自我批评不是简单的暴露，叫人丧气，而是为了提高士气，提高信心，把工作搞好。它是积极的，也必须是积极的。只要这样，也就不会使人丧气。我们这一次土地会议，还不是批评得很厉害吗？但我们大家并没有因此丧了气，反而使大家信心提高了。批评要合乎实情，哪些应该否定，哪些应该肯定，要恰如其分，并须有积极改进的办法，同时也不要怕为敌人所利用，即因噎废食，放弃批评与自批评。\n    我们的批评与自我批评，也要走群众路线，真正走群众路线，就要放手的进行批评与自我批评，彻底改造我们的作风，彻底改造我们一切工作。我们的报纸应成为发扬批评与自我批评的武器之一。\n    （一九四七年十一月七日在晋察冀边区土地会议上结论的一节）（转载晋察冀日报）"

The County Saltpeter Workers Committee responded to the County Party Committee's call to \"Support the Front Lines, Workers Increase Work Efficiency,\" organized and led the saltpeter workshops to challenge Yongxing Coal Mine to increase production. Saltpeter workshops also challenged each other. It is planned that the county's sixty-three saltpeter workshops and seventy-five pots will produce more than 150,000 jin of saltpeter in four months (that is, an average of more than sixteen jin of saltpeter per pot per day), an increase of more than ninety jin per pot per month compared to usual. From the start of the competition to now, less than three months, more than 110,000 jin have been completed. The Huangniuti saltpeter workshop usually produces more than 500 jin of saltpeter per month, but in November it produced more than 800 jin, an increase of more than 300 jin compared to before. According to the County Saltpeter Workers' Union's estimate, the task of producing 150,000 jin of saltpeter in four months will definitely be completed. In the process of increasing production, the wages in rice of each worker have also increased by a quarter compared to before. In the past, each worker earned about 180 jin of rice per month, but now they earn more than 240 jin, so the enthusiasm of the saltpeter workers is very high. Comrade Xu Youwen of the Saltpeter Workers' Union proposed: We can get these benefits because the counter-offensive on the front line is victorious, and the rear can be very stable in production and get such gains. Each of our workers should take out some of the increased wages in rice to support the front line and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. The workers strongly supported this proposal and said: We must take advantage of the New Year to send out the funds to support the front line. According to preliminary statistics, workers' donations have reached 840,000 yuan.

    "content": "The Soviet Supreme Soviet held its Fourth Congress on the 30th of last month and has now successfully concluded. The Congress passed the national budget for 1948, which is the largest budget in the Soviet Union's history during peacetime. It stipulates that funds for the national economy and social and cultural undertakings account for 68% of the total expenditures, while defense expenditures account for only 17%. This new budget has two major characteristics: first, the balance between revenue and expenditure has a large surplus (this year's revenue exceeds expenditure by as much as 40.1 billion rubles), which is in sharp contrast to the financial exhaustion and frequent large budget deficits of capitalist countries, indicating the strength of the Soviet Union and the superiority of the Soviet financial system; second, it is for the benefit of the people and the just cause of defending world democratic peace, on the one hand \"sparing no effort to strengthen national defense\" (Pravda), and on the other hand, striving to develop the national economy and improve the happiness of the Soviet people.\n\nThe cause of peace and democracy in Eastern Europe has made significant progress this week. The Soviet Union signed the Soviet-Romanian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance on the 4th, \"which is another strong fortress against new aggression and plundering imperialist plans.\" At the same time, Hungary and Romania concluded a twenty-year mutual assistance treaty and then signed a cultural cooperation agreement with Poland. The Romanian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party have agreed to form a unified workers' party, and all peasant parties have also merged to form a unified organization of the working people. In Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front held its second national congress, elected a new leadership with Dimitrov as chairman, and the merger of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party is also underway. From all this, it is not difficult to see that the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe are further consolidating their internal affairs, and strengthening their cooperation with the Soviet Union through mutual solidarity.\n\nThe people's movements in France, Italy, and Germany are continuing to expand and deepen.\n\nIn Italy, the People's Democratic Front held its first national congress on the 1st and adopted the Front's charter. This is the first new democratic charter in Italian history, stipulating the thorough reform of state institutions, the implementation of local autonomy, the nationalization of large monopolistic industries, land reform, and the confiscation of large landowners' property. Because this charter is in line with the interests of the vast majority of the Italian people, the foundation of the People's Democratic Front has become increasingly broad and solid. Now, the Italian people are enthusiastically responding to the Front's call to fight for the realization of this charter and to win the upcoming general election. The Gasperi government has been frightened out of its wits by the great unity and counterattack of the Italian people in this battle. It has no choice but to sign the humiliating \"U.S.-Italy Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation Agreement\" and wag its tail to beg its American father; on the other hand, it is desperately recruiting former Fascist officers and soldiers into the army in order to carry out armed suppression of the people in the general election. The struggle surrounding the general election will be a signal that the decisive battle in Italy is about to come.\n\nIn France, in coordination with the heroic struggle of the workers against the reactionary authorities' traitorous and dictatorial policies, the broad masses of peasants, at the call of the French Communist Party, also held a national \"Peasant Protest Day,\" demonstrating everywhere to oppose the emergency tax law. This proves that the French peasants have taken action to fight for the realization of the French Communist Party's program of \"improving the lives of peasants and establishing a people's democratic government.\"\n\nThe German people's struggle against hunger has further developed, and the number of striking workers has surged to more than three million. And the movement demanding the democratic unification of Germany is still surging throughout Germany.\n\nNews from the past week confirms that \"a broad democratic united front in the United States is gradually forming in the struggle against reactionary forces.\" (according to Zhukov of the Soviet Union) The \"Wallace for President National Committee\" has been formed, and the movement to support Wallace's campaign is unfolding more and more. A new development this week is that it has gained the enthusiastic support of many farmers in the East. At the same time, securities prices in the United States have clearly fallen, to a degree \"seen only since February of last year\" (TASS), foreshadowing that the American economic crisis is approaching. The U.S. monopoly capitalist groups are extremely panicked by this, and even Truman has had to exclaim, \"Unless a way is found to stop the intensifying inflation, economic collapse is inevitable.\" The crisis is like a volcano, this volcano that threatens U.S. imperialism every day, and it looks like it is about to erupt. Despite U.S. imperialism's baring its fangs and brandishing its claws everywhere, the true face of this paper tiger is becoming more and more exposed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联国力强大财政制度优越  美帝纸老虎真面貌日益暴露\n\n1948-02-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏联国力强大财政制度优越\n    美帝纸老虎真面貌日益暴露\n    苏联最高苏维埃于上月三十日举行第四次大会，现已圆满闭幕。大会通过了一九四八年度国家预算，这是苏联和平年代历史上最大的一次预算，她规定国民经济与社会、文化事业经费，占岁出总额达百分之六十八，而国防经费仅占百分之十七。这新预算有着两大特点：第一为收支相抵盈余极大（本年度收入即超过支出达四百零一亿卢布之巨），这与资本主义国家的财政枯竭与预算经常存在庞大赤字的情况适成鲜明对照，表明了苏联国力的强大和苏维埃财政制度的优越；第二为造福人民和保卫世界民主和平的正义事业，它一方面“毫不懈怠加强国防”（真理报），另一方面尽力发展国民经济与提高苏联人民的幸福生活。\n    东欧和平民主事业本周仍有显著进展。苏联已于四日与罗马尼亚签订了苏罗友好合作互助条约，“这是对抗新侵略与掠夺的帝国主义计划之又一坚强堡垒”。同时，匈牙利与罗马尼亚订立二十年互助条约后，又与波兰签订了文化合作协定。罗马尼亚共产党与社会民主党已协议筹组统一工人党，而所有农民政党亦已合并成立劳动人民的统一组织。在保加利亚，祖国阵线召开了第二届全国大会，选出了以季米特洛夫为主席的新领导机构，而保共与社会党的合并亦正进行中。这一切不难看出：东欧新民主主义各国正在更进一步巩固其内部，并互相团结加强与苏联的合作。\n    法意德三国的人民运动，正在继续扩大与深入中。\n    在意大利，人民民主阵线于一日召开了首届全国代表大会，并通过该阵线宪章。这是意国历史上第一部新民主主义的大宪章，它规定彻底改革国家机构，履行地方自治，实行大独占工业国有化，进行土地改革及没收大地主财产等。由于这一宪章符合意国绝大多数人民的利益，人民民主阵线的基础已愈见扩大和巩固。现在全意人民，正热烈响应该阵线的号召，为实现这一宪章和赢得行将到来的大选而斗争。加斯贝利政府在意国人民的这一战斗大团结和反攻震慑下，已吓得魂不附体。只好一方面签订丧权辱国的“美意友好通商航海协定”，向其美国爸爸摇尾乞怜；另一方面，则拼命征募前法西斯官兵入伍，以便在大选中进行对人民的武装镇压。环绕着大选的斗争，将是意国国内决定性战斗即将到来的信号。\n    在法国，配合着工人们抗击反动当局卖国独裁政策的英勇斗争，广大农民在法共号召下，也举行了全国性的“农民抗议日”。到处示威游行，以反对紧急税收法。这证明法国农民已行动起来，为实现法共“改善农民生活、成立人民民主政府”的纲领而斗争了。\n    德国人民反饥饿斗争更加发展，罢工工人已剧增至三百万以上。而要求德国民主统一的运动仍澎湃全德。\n    一周来的消息证实：美国“广泛的民主统一阵线，正在与反动力量斗争中逐渐形成。”（苏联朱可夫语）“华莱士竞选总统全国委员会”已经组成了，拥护华莱士竞选的运动正日益展开中。本周新的发展，就是它取得了东部许多农民的热烈支持。与此同时，美国国内证券价格已显然下跌，其程度“为去年二月以来所仅见”（塔斯社），预示着美国经济危机已临大门。美国独占资本集团对此均极度恐慌，甚至杜鲁门也不得不惊呼“除非找一个制止愈演愈烈的通货膨胀之方法，否则经济崩溃不可避免”。危机就象一座火山，这座每天威胁着美帝国主义的火山，眼看着就快要爆发了，尽管美帝国主义到处张牙舞爪，这纸老虎的真面目是越来越暴露了。"

British imperialism is trying to use this to incite civil war and prove its theory that the Indian people cannot govern themselves.\" It also pointed out: \"Gandhi's assassination was instigated by British agents because Gandhi, although not actively resisting British rule, had been working to prevent a civil war artificially created by British imperialism.\" According to a report by the United Press on the 30th, Gandhi stated to Hindus during his last fast that \"he would rather seek a glorious death than live to see India split due to the struggle between the Indian and Muslim parties.\" According to Agence France-Presse, the General Secretary of the Indian Communist Party, Joshi, sent a condolence message on the 1st, stating: \"The Indian Communist Party extends its respect to Mahatma Gandhi for his contribution to awakening the anti-imperialist and democratic spirit among the masses.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英帝企图挑起印度内战  甘地遇刺逝世\n\n1948-02-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    英帝企图挑起印度内战\n    甘地遇刺逝世\n    【新华社陕北九日电】新德里讯：上月三十日，七十八岁高龄之印国大党领袖甘地，于行赴晚祷途中遇刺逝世。凶手盖赛德当场被捕。据各方消息：盖赛德系来自蒲那的旁遮普籍印度教徒。二月一日孟买警察局复逮捕五名谋刺嫌疑犯，其中有大乘教团总书记等人。旁遮普国家银行支行经理，因在甘地遇刺前演说高呼“甘地该死！”亦于同日被捕。甘地死后，印度之新德里、孟买等城，均发生印度教徒间之流血事件。关于甘地被刺原因，据苏联兹伐维区教授四日在苏联文学报撰文称：“甘地之死，应由英帝国主义负责。英帝国主义力图借此挑起内战，并证明其所谓印人不能自治之理论。”并指出：“甘地之被谋杀，系英国特务所指使，因为甘地虽不积极反抗英国之统治，但一直在努力制止内战，而这种内战是由英帝国主义人工所造成的。”据合众社三十日透露，甘地在最后一次绝食中，曾向印度教徒表示：“他宁肯追求一个光荣解脱之死，不愿活着坐视印度因印回两党的斗争而分裂”。另据法新社讯，印共总书记约希一日致甘地吊唁，内称：“印共对圣雄甘地在群众中唤醒反帝国主义与民主精神之贡献，谨致推崇之忱”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th. The Logistics Department of the Northwestern Joint Defense Army recently held a meeting of ministers of its subordinate departments to review the work of the logistics departments in supply, health, and stationing over the past ten months, and to discuss methods for future improvement. Comrade He Long, Commander of the Joint Defense Army, and Comrade Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Field Army, both attended the meeting and gave instructions. Comrade Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Joint Defense Army, in his summary report, called on all comrades in logistics work to firmly implement the supply policy of unified planning and unified expenditure and strictly establish various logistics systems under the unified leadership of the Logistics Department of the Northwestern Joint Defense Army. Commander Wang pointed out that over the past few years, both the large collective and the small collective have accumulated considerable savings in the development of production. The unification of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui border regions, as well as the connection and support of various liberated areas, have provided the region with sufficient conditions for implementing unified planning and unified expenditure. However, it is necessary to correct the erroneous perception of some people who believe that unified planning and unified expenditure simply means asking the large collective for money. It is essential to deeply recognize that unified planning and unified expenditure not only guarantees the supply of the small collective by the large collective but also lies in the unification of policies, leadership, standards, and systems, and everyone should work hard to find ways. Commander Wang also pointed out: First, we must establish the idea that everything is for supporting the front line and guaranteeing the supply of the front line. When mobilizing all forces, we should unify the soldiers' viewpoint with the masses' viewpoint and implement the policy of taking both military and civilian needs into consideration. We should also implement economic democracy in the troops, stop all expenditures beyond the standards. In order to guarantee supply and eliminate certain concerns, Commander Wang specifically explained: (1) All expenditures that have not been reported for final settlement in the past but were self-sufficient through production, if they are legitimate and necessary, are still included within the scope of supply standards; (2) Guarantee the timely supply of goods or funds. To avoid the impact of rising prices on actual purchasing power, one month's funding can be pre-paid; (3) The prices stipulated in the supply standards should be consistent with local market prices, and if there is a temporary increase, it will be appropriately raised.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北联防军检讨后勤工作  严格确立各种制度  贯彻统筹统支方针\n\n1948-02-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    西北联防军检讨后勤工作\n    严格确立各种制度\n    贯彻统筹统支方针\n    【新华社西北八日电】西北联防军后勤部最近召开所属各部部长会议，检讨十个月来后勤部门供给、卫生、兵站等工作，并讨论今后改进方法。联防军司令员贺龙同志、西北野战军副司令员张宗逊同志均到会指示，联防军副司令员王维舟同志在总结报告中号召全体后勤工作同志在西北联防军后勤部的统一领导下，坚决贯彻统筹统支的供给方针及严格确立各种后勤制度。王司令员指出几年来大公家小公家在发展生产中均有相当积蓄，陕甘宁、晋绥两边区的统一，以及各解放区的联系与支援，使本区具备了实行统筹统支的足够条件，但必须纠正某些人以为统筹统支只是伸手向大公家要钱的错误认识，必须深刻认识统筹统支不仅是大公家保证小公家的供给，而且更在于政策、领导、标准、制度的统一，要大家努力设法。王司令员并指出：首先确定一切为着支援前线保障前线的供给思想，而在动员一切力量时，应把士兵观点与群众观点统一起来，贯彻军民兼顾方针。并在部队中实行经济民主，停止一切标准以外的开支，为了保证供给消除某些顾虑，王司令员特说明：（一）凡过去未报决算而生产自给的开支，属于正当和必要的，仍包括在供给标准范围内；（二）保证实物或经费按时供给，为避免物价上涨影响实际购买力，可预支一个月经费；（三）供给标准所规定的物价和当地市价一致，如临时上涨，则予以适当提高。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th: Li Dingming, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, unfortunately passed away on December 11th of last year. Representatives from all circles in the Northwest will establish a funeral committee and have decided to hold a memorial service in a certain location in northern Shaanxi on February 25th. His biography is announced as follows: Vice Chairman Li, named Fenggong, courtesy name Dingming, was born on September 28th, 1881, in Taohuamao Village, Mizhi County. In his youth, his family was poor and unable to afford teachers, so he studied at the home of his maternal uncle, Mr. Du Douyuan (a former Qing Dynasty scholar), where he read extensively in the classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections. He was particularly skilled in sciences such as geography, mathematics, astronomy, and meteorology, and even made his own globes and astronomical instruments to calculate solar and lunar eclipses. In the late Qing Dynasty, he established free schools and promoted social welfare activities such as foot binding prohibition and gambling prohibition. In 1910, he was hired as a teacher at Suide Middle School. After the Xinhai Revolution, he founded elementary schools in his home county, broke superstitions, accepted temple property to enrich school funds, improved teaching methods, lectured on scientific knowledge, and encouraged students to engage in extracurricular labor, growing their own vegetables and building their own dormitories. After four years of operation, the results were remarkable. In 1917, he was hired as a teacher at Yulin Middle School, teaching courses such as Chinese language, history, geography, and mathematics. In 1923, he served as the head of the advisory section of the Yulin Daoyin Office, and in 1926, he returned to his hometown due to illness. In addition to vigorously promoting local public welfare undertakings, he also used his medical practice to support his life, while reading extensively. As a result, his knowledge and thinking improved day by day. In his later years, Mr. Li accepted revolutionary ideas. After the July 7th Incident, he supported the Communist Party's call for unity and resistance against Japan and opposed Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist and anti-people policies. He often said: \"The Communist Party does things for the people and will surely win in the future. Chiang Kai-shek is anti-communist and anti-people and will surely fail in the future.\" In 1941, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region conducted a general election, and Mr. Li was elected as the speaker of the Mizhi County Council and a member of the Border Region Council. In the winter of that year, he was elected as the Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government at the Second Session of the Border Region Council, until his death. Since taking office, he supported the New Democratic policies, advocated streamlining administration and reducing troops, and vigorously promoted the development of production through intensive farming, immigration and land reclamation, cotton planting and afforestation. After several years of the great production movement in the Border Region, the people's lives have been greatly improved. He excitedly said: \"Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I am willing to dedicate my aging body to the country and the nation.\" In the past seven years, he has made many contributions to the construction of the Border Region. He once said to Chinese and foreign reporters who came to Yan'an for investigation: \"Some individuals at home and abroad say that the Border Region government is controlled and monopolized by the Communist Party. I think this is ridiculous. If you want to find control and monopoly, you can only find it among the domestic and foreign dictators. We have established a democratic coalition government where everyone has a job and a right.\" Mr. Li was very concerned about the national political situation. Whenever the situation turned for the worse, he was filled with righteous indignation and resolutely opposed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial, civil war, and traitorous policies, and shouted loudly to strive for peace and democracy. He strongly agreed with the Outline Land Law of China, and in his last words he still said, \"The Communist Party's launch of the masses to thoroughly and equally distribute the land, and the review of cadres and party members, are two extremely great policies. With these two policies, it will be guaranteed that the Communist Party's leadership of the Chinese revolution will surely be victorious.\" At about 10:00 p.m. on December 9, 1947, Vice Chairman Li suddenly suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage. The Border Region Government invited doctors Zhang Jiefu, Yan Huashan, Shen Jizhong, Gao Feng and Li Zhensan (Chinese medicine doctor) his eldest son, for two consultations and Li Zhensan personally treated him, but due to the severity of the illness, the medicine was ineffective, and he passed away at 6:00 a.m. on the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Border Region Government, Chang Lifu, and Li Zhensan and Li Zhiji, the eldest and fourth sons of Vice Chairman Li, personally supervised the encoffining. On the 14th, the coffin was transported back to Mizhi, his hometown. Along the way, the masses offered condolences and sacrifices in an endless stream. On the 16th, it arrived home, and was buried on the 19th. Vice Chairman Li lived to be 67 years old. He is survived by four sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Zhensan, is currently working at the Border Region Industrial Cooperative Office. The second son, Liguo, a member of the Communist Party, is currently working at the Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters in Harbin. The third son, Li Dafu, a member of the Communist Party, works at the Suide Partition Commissioner's Office. There are nine grandsons and six granddaughters, four of whom have already joined the revolutionary work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁边区政府副主席  李鼎铭先生生平事略\n\n1948-02-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    陕甘宁边区政府副主席\n    李鼎铭先生生平事略\n    【新华社西北八日电】陕甘宁边区政府副主席李鼎铭，不幸于去年十二月十一日病逝，西北各界当成立治丧委员会，决定于二月二十五日在陕北某地举行追悼大会；并公布其生平事略如下：李副主席名丰功字鼎铭，于一八八一年九月廿八日生于米脂县桃花峁村，幼年家贫无力延师就学，于舅父杜斗垣先生（前清举人）家攻读，遍览经史子集，尤精于地理数学天文气象等科学，曾自造地球仪天文盘，计算日月蚀。满清末年兴办义学，提倡放足、禁赌等社会公益事业。一九一○年受聘绥德中学教员。辛亥革命后又在本县创办小学，破除迷信，接受庙产，充实学校基金，改良教学方法，讲授科学知识，提倡学生课余劳动，自种蔬菜，自建宿舍，经营四年，成绩卓著。一九一七年受聘榆林中学教员，担任国文、史地、数学等课程。一九二三年任榆林道尹公署顾问科长等职，一九二六年因病返里，专心研究医学，此后十余年在家除对地方公益事业极力提倡促进外，一面借行医维持生活，一面博览新书，因之他的学问思想随之日益进步。先生晚年时代接受革命思想，七七事变后拥护共产党团结抗日主张，反对蒋介石之反共反人民政策，他常说：“共产党为人民做事将来必然胜利，蒋介石反共反人民将来必然失败”。一九四一年陕甘宁边区进行普选，先生被选为米脂县参议会议长与边区参议员。是年冬边区第二届参议会当选为陕甘宁边区政府副主席，直至病逝。任职以来拥护新民主主义政策，倡议精兵简政，极力提倡发展生产精耕细作，移民垦荒，植棉造林，边区经过几年来大生产运动，人民生活大大改善，他兴奋的说：“在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我情愿以我的衰朽残躯为国家民族竭尽绵薄”。七年以来他对于边区建设事业贡献颇多，他曾对到延安考察的中外记者说：“国内外还有个别分子说边区政权是共产党把持包办，我认为这话是很可笑的，我想要找把持包办只能到国内国外独裁主义者那里去找，我们这个地方都是建立了大家有职有权的民主联合政府”。先生对于全国政局十分关怀，每遇时局逆转，辄义愤填膺坚决反对蒋介石独裁内战卖国政策，为争取和平民主而大声疾呼。他对于中国土地法大纲极表赞同，遗言中犹有“共产党发动群众彻底平分土地，审查干部和党员，这两项政策伟大极了，有了这两项政策将保证共产党领导中国革命必然胜利成功”。一九四七年十二月九日晚十时许，李副主席突患脑出血症，当经边府邀请张介夫、阎华山、沈继中、高枫等医生及李副主席长子李赈三（中医）等两次会诊，并由李振三亲为疗治，终因病势沉重，药石无效，于十一日上午六时逝世，十二日晨由边府副秘书长常黎夫暨李副主席长子李振三四子李之纪等亲视入殓。十四日运柩回米脂原籍，沿途群众吊唁致祭者络绎不绝。十六日抵家，十九日安葬。李副主席享年六十有七。遗子四女二，长子振三，现在边区工合办事处工作，次子力果，共产党员，现在哈尔滨东北人民解放军总部工作，三子李达夫共产党员在绥德分区专员公署工作，有孙男九孙女六，四人已参加革命工作。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-12",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: The Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party convened a Harbin Municipal Organs' Party Rectification Mobilization Meeting on the 26th of last month. Over a thousand cadres attended and listened to Comrade Li Fuchun's report on \"Summarizing Reorganization and Conducting Party Rectification.\" Comrade Fuchun first pointed out that the three-month reorganization of Harbin municipal organs had come to an end. The directly subordinate organs of the Northeast Bureau and Military Region, as well as the provincial-level organs of Songjiang Province, reduced personnel by 12% of the original staff. This saved a great deal on housing, vehicles, etc., and could save approximately 130 million yuan in expenses for the whole year. Apart from a few dismissals or purges, the streamlined personnel were sent to work in the front lines, local factories, farms, and schools. The organs have become more organized, established their structures, and established office, living, and study systems. In particular, through democratic meetings, criticism and self-criticism were promoted, corruption and waste were opposed, work and the style of rear organs were improved, and everyone was alerted to how to work and live in the city. The gains in this regard are immeasurable and greater than the savings of manpower and material resources. Comrade Fuchun continued, saying that the reorganization still lacked a systematic solution to problems in ideological style, and democratic criticism and self-criticism had not been sufficiently developed. Therefore, the reorganization can only be regarded as the beginning of Party rectification. In the past ten years, our Party has grown from tens of thousands of members to 2.7 million members. Due to the Party's great development, some landlords, rich peasants, and rogue elements have infiltrated the Party, especially in grassroots organizations, where their impure composition has become an obstacle to land reform and revolutionary advancement. From the perspective of ideological impurity, it is not just a problem of grassroots organizations. Many cadres have shown unstable positions and blurred class views in implementing new tasks and new policies under the new situation, and have developed impure styles, especially prominent bureaucracy and formalism. Party rectification is to overcome these shortcomings. However, in the Northeast, because local Party organizations, especially grassroots organizations, are newly established, and some are still being established, impure composition and style cannot play a decisive role in whether land reform is thoroughly implemented. Moreover, when the land is thoroughly and equally distributed and the poor and hired peasant class rises, these organizations can be transformed in the movement. The decisive influence is the old cadres, because they are models for the new cadres and the backbone of the Party's close connection with the people of the Northeast. Therefore, the Northeast Bureau has decided to first pay attention to rectifying the old cadres. At this point, Comrade Fuchun cited the facts that some old cadres had shown left-right wavering in implementing the Party's line and policies in various tasks such as carrying out land reform and protecting industry and commerce, as well as the errors of bureaucracy, formalism, and liberalism in their style. He called on everyone to welcome the Party rectification movement with the greatest enthusiasm and \"wash their faces and bask in the sun.\" Regarding the methods and steps of Party rectification in directly subordinate organs, Comrade Fuchun pointed out that the content of Party rectification in organs should focus on learning, combined with examining thinking, position, and lifestyle, and, when necessary, examining composition, to clarify the historical and social roots of bad ideas, styles, and lifestyles, so as to rectify them. The content of study should focus on Chairman Mao's report, combined with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's summary report at the National Land Conference, and the focus of study should be determined according to different jobs, to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and to connect with actual work. During the study, take turns to participate in land reform and the workers' movement. In addition to those who have already participated, those who remain in the organs can organize rural visiting groups to go to the countryside in rotation for two or three months. Harbin municipal organ branches should combine with workers, with one branch helping one factory, helping workers and learning from workers. The Northeast Bureau has organized a general study committee for directly subordinate organs, and each ministry, commission, and system has established study sub-committees. Starting from February 1st, first spend two months studying documents, combined with examining thinking, position, and style, and then examining work, lifestyle, and composition. The overall goal is to grasp the spirit of Chairman Mao's report, clarify the Party's line and policies, improve thinking, firm up position, adopt a democratic style, live a simple life, and make the Party more closely connected with the people, so that the old cadres can lead the new cadres to fight for the victory of the revolution.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北中央局召开哈市机关整党动员大会  总结整编进行整党  李富春同志报告\n\n1948-02-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    东北中央局召开哈市机关整党动员大会\n    总结整编进行整党\n    李富春同志报告\n    【新华社东北九日电】中共东北中央局上月二十六日召开哈市机关整党动员大会，出席干部千余名，听取李富春同志“总结整编和进行整党”的报告。富春同志首先指出：哈市机关历时三个月的整编已告一段落，东北局和军区直属各机关以及松江省省级各机关精简人员，共占原有人员的百分之十二，节省住房汽车等甚多，全年可节省开支约十三万万元。精简人员除少数解雇或被清洗外，其余都分别送往前线、地方工场、农场和学校工作，各机关相当严密了组织，确定了编制，建立了办公、生活及学习制度。特别是通过民主大会，发扬了批评和自我批评，反对了贪污浪费，改进了工作和影响后方机关的作风，警惕了大家在城市应当如何工作和生活，这方面的收获比人力物力的节省更大的不可计算。富春同志继谓：在思想作风上，整编还缺乏系统的解决问题，民主批评和自我批评还发扬不够，因此整编只能视为整党的开端。十年来我党由几万党员发展到二百七十万党员，由于党的大发展，有些地主富农流氓分子混进了党，特别在基层组织中表现成份不纯，今天就成了土地改革和革命前进的阻碍。而从思想不纯来看，就不单纯是基层组织的问题，许多干部在新形势下，在执行新任务新政策中表现出了立场不稳和阶级观点模糊，并产生了作风不纯，特别是官僚主义形式主义突出。整党就是为了克服这些毛病。但在东北因为地方党特别是基层组织是新建立的，有的才正在建立，成份与作风不纯对土改的贯彻与否，还不能起决定作用，而且在彻底平分土地以及贫雇农阶级起来时，这些组织可以在运动中求得改造；有决定影响的是老干部，因为他们是新干部的榜样，是党与东北人民密切结合的骨干。因此，东北局决定首先要注意整老干部。至此，富春同志列举有些老干部在进行土改、保护工商业等各种工作中，表现执行党的路线与政策发生左右摇摆的事实，以及作风上的官僚主义、形式主义和自由主义的错误，号召每个人都应以最大热忱欢迎整党运动，洗脸晒太阳。关于直属机关整党的方法和步骤，富春同志指出：机关整党内容应以学习为主，联系查思想、查立场、查生活，必要时查成份，弄清坏思想、作风、生活的历史社会根源，以便整掉。学习内容以毛主席报告为主，结合刘少奇同志在全国土地会议上的总结报告，并根据工作不同决定学习重点，展开批评和自我批评，与实际工作联系。学习中轮流参加土改和工人运动，除已参加者外，留机关者可组织农村参观团，在两三个月内轮流下乡。哈市机关支部与工人结合，一个支部帮助一个工厂，帮助工人并向工人学习。东北局组织直属机关总学委会，各部委、各系统成立学习分委会，从二月一日起先以两个月学习文件，联系查思想、立场、作风，然后查工作、生活、成份。总的目的是要求达到掌握毛主席报告精神，弄清党的路线和政策，提高思想，坚定立场，作风民主，生活朴素，使党与人民更密切结合起来，老干部带起新干部为革命的胜利而奋斗。"

Their saving methods were: (1) In each allocation of civilian labor, the total weight of all items to be transported was precisely calculated, and then the number of civilian laborers to be used was calculated based on the general labor burden (generally not exceeding fifty catties). For example, a certain unit needed to allocate 400 civilian laborers to transport single military uniforms from a certain place to a certain place. After precise calculation, 144 civilian laborers were saved, which could save 390 labor days calculated on a daily basis (one labor day is calculated as 60 li per day). (2) Each time mobilizing civilian labor for transportation, in order to implement the \"bring-back\" policy, before the civilian laborers started, they first contacted the relevant transportation departments to find out if they had anything to transport, and asked the quantity, from where to where, so that the civilian laborers who were traveling empty could bring back or take along goods on their return or departure. This also saved a large number of labor days; however, it must be noted that the weight transported by the civilian laborers who are also carrying goods should not be the same as the weight transported by the civilian laborers who are only transporting goods out. The physical condition and energy of the civilian laborers must be taken into consideration, and the weight of the goods carried along must be lighter.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 动员民工作到精确计算  晋城一月节省人工万余\n\n1948-02-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    动员民工作到精确计算\n    晋城一月节省人工万余\n    【太岳消息】晋城县府在一月份动员民工工作中，因为作到精确计算，节省了民力共计一万三千六百一十四个工。他们节省的办法是：（一）在每一次拨派民工时，精确计算了全部所运东西的重量，然后再根据一般劳力负担情况（一般不超过五十斤），算出应该使用的民力数。如某部由某地往某地运单军衣要拨四百个民工，精确计算后，节省了一百四十四个民工，按日工计算，可省三百九十个日工（每日以六十里算一工）。（二）每次动员民力运输，为了实行捎差，在民工没动身起运前，先就和有关各运输部门取得连系，了解他们是不是有要运输的东西，并问清有多少数目，从哪里起到哪里去，好让空走的民工返回或出发时捎去、或捎回，这样节省民力数目也很大；但必须注意到捎运东西的民工，不能和只运出的民工运的重量一样，要照顾到民工的身体和精力，捎运的重量一定要轻一些。"

In areas with severe disasters, even more attention should be paid, but the focus of the equal distribution of land cannot be shifted. In terms of specific practices, attention should be paid to seizing the gaps between struggles to organize the masses to transport and sell goods. Livestock distributed to poor peasants should be used well and not left idle. In some areas, the masses have difficulty selling mountain products and medicinal materials; stores should take the initiative to help sell them externally. At the same time, all trade departments should pay attention to improving the operation of shops and forwarding stations, and reduce profits to reduce the difficulties for the masses in transportation and sales. After poor peasants are allocated movable property, they can organize production through new forms of mutual aid and cooperation. In mountainous areas, the masses can be organized to collect firewood, and stores and market management departments should develop firewood markets to facilitate firewood transactions, and organize the exchange of firewood for other materials. In short, it is necessary to promote the spirit of \"saving money\" and \"saving effort\" so that farmers can \"obtain wealth and use wealth.\" The difficulties faced by liberated farmers in future production will certainly be many, such as a shortage of agricultural implements, seeds, and fertilizers. In addition to the general promotion of collecting manure and accumulating fertilizer in various ways to increase fertilizer, agricultural implements, etc., can be manufactured as soon as possible through various craftsmen providing mutual assistance or self-operation.

In early November of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits transferred a battalion of Shanghai tax police, two companies of county security teams, and a regiment of the reorganized 21st Division, totaling more than 2,000 people, and in collusion with landlords and local bullies who had fled to Nantong, Shanghai, and other places, under the supervision of Zhang Yeli, the director of the Shanghai branch of the bandit Central Bank, entered the Sanyu District of Nantong, the second largest cotton producing area in the country, to set up eight strongholds and carry out stationed seizure. Our Ninth Sub-district military and civilians immediately launched a full-scale anti-cotton seizure movement. At the end of November, a unit of our local armed forces captured Liuqiao in Tongxi (Nantong West). In December, the Central China Liberation Army counter-attacked the Jue (Gang) Ma (Tang) line, threatening the bandit and puppet forces in various strongholds. The district and township guerrillas actively moved through the heart of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, repelling the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who seized cotton dozens of times. More than a thousand young people jumped into the blockade to transport cotton, while strictly controlling feudal forces, eliminating traitors and counter-revolutionaries, cutting off the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' ears and eyes, and launching anti-Baоjia and anti-rumor struggles. By the end of last month, when our local armed forces captured Shigang in Nantong, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Beixinqiao, Jiuzhongzha, and other strongholds fled in panic, leaving only the bandit and puppet forces in the Sanyu stronghold, trapped and awaiting death.\n    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th: More than 1,000 men of the 42nd Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Eighth Army in Yantai, carrying more than 200 large and small vehicles, set out to plunder on the 25th of last month and were completely defeated by our army in the Sunjiatan and Kongjiatan areas more than 20 miles southeast of Yantai city. It is estimated that more than 120 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and 184 bandits, including bandit Lieutenant Staff Officer Yu Yijun, were captured alive, and 186 large and small vehicles were seized.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 8th: Delayed news: The Huaibei People's Liberation Army continuously captured important enemy strongholds between January 21st and 25th, eliminating more than 200 enemies. The details are as follows: 1. Caiwei, more than 50 miles south of Suqian city, was captured, and the entire puppet Suqian security squadron was wiped out, capturing 114 enemies, including 8 enemy squadron leaders and \"Communist Suppression\" captains. 2. Pogou was captured, capturing more than 50 enemies. 3. Youji in the north of Lingbi was captured, and the three puppet township offices of Youji, Liuzhai, and Yugou, as well as dozens of puppet district captains, were wiped out, killing 20 enemies. A total of eight light and heavy machine guns, 156 rifles, four gun magazines, and a quantity of ammunition were seized in the three battles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南通反抢棉斗争胜利  烟台东南毙俘抢掠蒋匪三百  淮北连克重要据点歼敌二百\n\n1948-02-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    南通反抢棉斗争胜利\n    烟台东南毙俘抢掠蒋匪三百\n    淮北连克重要据点歼敌二百\n    【新华社华东十日电】南通三余区三万军民坚持两个月的反抢棉斗争，现已告一段落。计保存了公棉百分之九九点五，私棉百分之七十以上。去年十一月初蒋匪曾增调上海税警一个大队，县保安队两个中队，配合整二十一师一个团共二千余人，并结合逃往南通上海等地之地主恶霸，由匪中央银行上海分行行长张野里督率，进入全国第二产棉区的南通三余区，按下八个据点，实行驻抢。我九分区军民当即全面展开反抢棉运动。十一月底，我地武一部攻克通（南通）西之刘桥。十二月华中解放军反攻掘（港）马（塘）线，威胁各据点之匪伪。区乡游击队积极穿行于蒋匪心脏，数十次打退抢棉之蒋匪，千余青年则跳进封锁圈内抢运，同时并严格管制封建势力，除奸反特，割断蒋匪耳目，开展反保甲反谣言等斗争。至上月下旬，我地武攻克南通石港时，北新桥、九中闸等据点之蒋匪闻风而逃，仅存三余据点匪伪，困守待毙。\n    【新华社华东十日电】烟台蒋匪第八军四十二旅所部千余名，于上月廿五日携带大小车二百余辆出动抢掠，被我军全部击溃于烟市东南二十余里之孙家滩、孔家滩一带。计毙伤敌官兵一百二十余名，生俘匪上尉参谋余一骏以下一百八十四名，缴获大小车辆一八六辆。\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线八日电】迟到消息：淮北人民解放军于一月二十一日至二十五日间连克敌重要据点，歼敌二百余名。计：一、克宿迁城南五十余里之蔡圩，歼伪宿迁保安中队全部，俘敌一百十四名，歼敌中队长及“剿共”队长以下八名。二、克迫沟，俘敌五十余名。三、克灵壁北之游集，歼游集、刘砦、渔沟三个伪乡公所，及伪区大队长以下数十名，毙敌二十名。三次战斗共缴获轻重机枪八挺，步枪一五六支，枪弹筒四个，及弹药一部。"

    "content": "Taihang District Clearing Committee Decides to\n    Clear Up the Production and Property of Organs\n    [Taihang News] The Taihang District Clearing Committee was formally established on January 10th. Comrade Lai Ruoyu is the chairman, Comrades Zhao Huilou and Li Yiqing are the vice-chairmen, and Comrades Zhou Guangtan, Wu Zuomin, Yang Wenwei, Ye Song, Song Guanying, and Fan Xinshan are the members. They are responsible for leading the clearing up of organ production and organ property in the entire district.\n    [Taihang News] On the 6th of this month, the Taihang District Clearing Committee issued \"Instructions on Clearing Up the Production and Property of Organs\" to the clearing committees at all levels of local and military units in the entire district. The instructions first pointed out that the clearing up must be led by the top leaders, with each unit taking the lead in systematic clearing, and then concentrating and receiving by region and area. It is essential to avoid drastic price increases and decreases and to prevent the market from being greatly affected. It is necessary to prohibit the massive disposal of materials due to the ending of operations as much as possible. It is essential to prevent property from being lost. If there are any cases of corruption, waste, concealment, or favoritism, disciplinary actions should be taken according to the seriousness of the circumstances. Regarding the scope of the clearing, the instructions pointed out that the organ property and organ surpluses referred to by the Central Bureau and the District Party Committee should include the following four types: First, accumulated savings from previous years; second, the surplus from 1936; third, materials seized from the enemy and puppets during the war; and fourth, grain funds received in excess of the original number of personnel in the organs. The instructions stated that all production by various militias and the Armed Committees should be terminated, and all property confiscated by public security departments at all levels should be handed over to the public. The clearing methods stipulated that the border region and local grain funds used for organ production should not be returned privately, but must be reviewed and approved by the Clearing Committee. For larger amounts, a report should be made to the higher-level Clearing Committee. In order not to affect the market, during the clearing period, shops that are designated by the District Party Committee-level Clearing Committee as capable of implementing policies and having stronger cadres may continue to operate as before, while the rest must immediately cease operations. Production with supply tasks (such as family schools) must be managed by operators and reported to the District Party Committee-level Clearing Committee for approval. Some factories, coal mines, and hospitals that cannot stop operating should operate while clearing up. Once the clearing is completed, the Clearing Committee will send personnel to take over and directly lead (hospitals and cigarette factories will be accepted by the public, without transferring them to private individuals). In order to carry out the clearing in a planned, step-by-step, and systematic manner, it is necessary to convene meetings of the main responsible personnel of each production unit and the secretaries of each organ, to get these people thinking straight, discuss specific methods, inspire them to consciously carry out the clearing, and formulate plans, and announce strict discipline. Clearing committees at all levels should also organize inspection teams to conduct inspections. The clearing committees of the military system are responsible both to the higher-level clearing committees of the military system and to the clearing committees of the party committees at the same level, but when calculating property in the future, the military and local authorities must calculate separately and not mix them together.\n    [Taihang News] On the 1st of this month, the Taihang Clearing Committee announced the \"Measures for the Conclusion of the Clearing of Production by Organs at the District Administrative Office and Military Region Levels.\" The regulations stipulate: 1. All property of organ production units must be thoroughly investigated and registered, and handled separately. The fruits of struggle should be returned to the masses, and property obtained through abnormal operations or of unknown origin should be handed over to the public in full and not be distributed as dividends. 2. The invested shares and dividends of organs are not allowed to be withdrawn. Those withdrawn before December 26th of last year (i.e., the date of the conclusion of the meeting of all production units at the District Party Committee level) will be handled together during the clearing of organ property. Those withdrawn after the 26th are illegal and should be reported to the Clearing Committee for handling. Private shares and dividends, except for those of the targets of struggle who are not allowed to withdraw, must be certified by the head of the organ for staff members and by the village for the masses. 3. All debts should be cleared during the clearing period, but items should not be sold cheaply due to the urgency of clearing debts; long-term loans from organs are not allowed to be withdrawn temporarily and will be resolved together during the clearing of organ property. Temporary loans may be withdrawn after being reviewed by the head of the organ and approved by the Clearing Committee; bank loans should be repaid, but must be reviewed and approved by the head of the organ. 4. Losses and bad debts must be listed in detail, with the reasons explained, and approved by the Clearing Committee after being reviewed by the head of the organ. 5. For property valuation, commodities and raw materials should be valued according to the general market price and the distinction between popular and unpopular goods, either at face value, 90% of value, or 80% of value, and verified by the valuation organization designated by the Clearing Committee; operating equipment, furniture, and houses should not be valued, but should be handled at the original price or the price at the end of the last period; non-priced property should be registered and transferred. 6. Strict inspections must be carried out during the clearing, and the reasons must be thoroughly investigated if discrepancies are found between the actual objects and the accounts. During the clearing, except for the sale of some items necessary to repay external debts, no other business is allowed. During the clearing, the main responsible persons of each production unit are not allowed to be transferred. Those who are not related to the clearing and were sent by the original organ should be handled by the original organ in cooperation with the Clearing Committee. Hired personnel should be dismissed separately, and the targets of struggle should be sent back to their original places of origin along with all their shares, dividends, and bonuses to be handed over to the masses. The distribution of bonuses and dividends shall be in accordance with the original regulations of each unit, but regardless of whether the personnel are on the supply system or the salary system, the maximum amount per person per year shall not exceed 400 jin of rice or 60,000 yuan, while personnel without salary and without supply shall not exceed 1,200 jin of rice or 180,000 yuan per year, and the minimum shall be 600 jin of rice or 90,000 yuan. At the end of the clearing of each organ production unit, a report on the clearing situation shall be submitted to the Clearing Committee, and all property shall not be moved, but shall be sealed on the spot and taken over by the organ designated by the Clearing Committee. Factories (excluding cigarette factories), workshops, and horse-drawn carriage inns, etc., that are beneficial to economic construction and needed by the masses, may be transferred if local cooperative societies, the masses, or employees are willing to operate them, but must be approved by the Clearing Committee. All cadre cooperative societies must be terminated, and employee cooperative societies are not allowed to operate on the market, but only to supply their own employees internally. Finally, the measures stipulate that any concealment, corruption, waste, favoritism, etc., during the conclusion of the clearing of organ production, as well as the private transfer of property without the approval of the Clearing Committee, shall be deemed as corruption and punished in accordance with the regulations on punishing corruption promulgated by the Border Government.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行区清理委员会决定  清理机关生产和财产\n\n1948-02-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    太行区清理委员会决定\n    清理机关生产和财产\n    【太行消息】太行区清理委员会于一月十日正式成立。赖若愚同志为主任委员，赵辉楼、李一清两同志为副主任委员，周光坦、吴作民、杨文蔚、叶松、宋冠英、范新三等六同志为委员。负责领导全区清理机关生产与机关财产。\n    【太行消息】太行区清理委员会，于本月六日，向全区各级地方和部队清理委员会发出“关于清理机关生产和机关财产的指示”。首先指出：清理当中，必须首长负责，首先以各单位为主，进行系统清理，然后再分区分地进行集中和接收。必须不形成物价暴涨暴跌，不使市场受到很大影响，要尽量禁止因为结束而大量抛出物资。必须不使财产受到损失，如有贪污、浪费、埋伏、徇情舞弊等情形，应按情节轻重给以纪律处分。在清理范围上，该指示指出：中央局和区党委所指的机关财产和机关节余，应包括下列四种：一是历年积存，二是三十六年度节余，三是战争中抓来的敌伪物资，四是超过机关原有人数多领的粮食经费。该指示称：各种民兵及武委会之生产都应结束，各级公安部门所没收之一切财产，都应交公。清理办法规定：机关生产动用之边区粮款及地方粮款，不许私下归还，必须经清委会审查批准。数目较大的，应向上级清委会作报告。为了不使市场受到影响，清理期间经区党委一级清委会批准，指定能执行政策、干部较强的商店照旧营业，其余必须立即停止营业。带有供给任务之生产（如家属学校）必须经营者，须报告区党委一级清委会批准。有些工厂、煤矿、医院不能停止经营者，应当一面经营，一面清理，一经清理完毕，清委会即派员接收，直接领导（医院同烟厂由公家接受，不必转让私人）。为了有计划、有步骤、有系统的进行清理，需要召开各生产单位主要负责人员及各机关秘书会议，打通这些人的思想，讨论具体办法，启发他们自觉进行清理，并制定计划，宣布严格的纪律。各级清委会并要自行组织检查队，进行检查。部队系统之清委会，既对军队系统之上级清委会负责，又须对同级党委之清委会负责，但将来计算财产时，部队同地方须分别计算，不可混合。\n    【太行消息】本月一日，太行清理委员会公布“太行区行署军区级机关生产清理结束办法”。规定：一、机关生产单位的一切财产，都须彻底清查登记，分别处理。是斗争果实的归还群众，非正常经营所得及来历不明的财产，全数交公，不得当作红利分红。二、机关投资的股金与红利，一律不许提取，在去年十二月二十六日前（即召开区党委一级各生产单位会议结束之日）提取的，在清理机关财产时一块处理，二十六日以后提取的，都是非法，应呈报清委会处理。私人股金和红利，除斗争对象的其本人不得提取外，工作人员领取须机关首长证明，群众领取须经村证明。三、往来借贷都需在清理期间全部清结，但不得因急于清结而贱卖物品；向机关长期借贷的款暂时不许提取，等在清理机关财产时一块解决。临时借的，经机关首长审核转清委会批准后可提取；银行贷款应归还，但须经机关首长审核批准。四、损失和呆帐处理，须详列清单，说明原因，经机关首长审核转清委会批准。五、财产作价，商品和原料应按一般市价与分别冷热货，或不扣、或九扣、或八扣作价，由清委会指定之作价组织核定；营业用具及家具、房屋不得作价，按原价或上期结帐作价处理；无价财产，登记移交。六、清理中必须严格检查，发现实物和帐目不符时，必须彻底追查原因。在清理中除为偿还外欠必须出卖一部物品外，其余一律不许营业。在清理当中，各生产单位主要负责人不准调动，与进行清理无关的人，是原机关派去的，由原机关协同清委会处理，雇用人员分别遣散，斗争对象应连同他所有之股金、红利和提奖，一齐送回原籍交群众。提奖分红，照各单位原来规定，但不论供给制或薪金制的人员，最高每人每年均不得超过四百斤米或六万元钱，而无薪金又不供给的人员，每年最高不得超过一千二百斤米或十八万元钱，最低也须发给六百斤米或九万元钱。各机关生产单位清理结束时，应将清理情况表报清委会，所有财产都不搬动，原地封存，由清委会指定机关负责接收。有益于经济建设和群众所需要的工厂（不包括烟厂）、作坊、车马店等，如当地合作社群众或职工愿意经营的，可以转让，但必须经清委会批准。一切干部合作社必须结束，职工合作社不得对市场经营，只许对内供给职工自己。最后，该办法规定：机关生产清理结束中，任何埋伏、贪污、浪费、徇情舞弊等情形，以及未经清委会批准而私自移用财产等情形，均属贪污，按照边府颁布之惩治贪污条例治罪。"

    "content": "Column:\n\n    Many Village Cadres Act Undemocratically\n    The Masses are Oppressed and Have Not Fully Overthrown the Old Order\n    We are using the largest amount of space possible to welcome comrades from all over the border region participating in the land redistribution work to exchange work situations, exchange work opinions, and research work problems, and concentrate opinions from multiple parties and then jointly solve them. Whether it's systematic or fragmented, material or experience; whether it's in the form of writing articles, writing letters, or writing news reports and diaries, any form is good, just write out what you want to say; do not use Party jargon or empty talk. Other comrades can also write letters to discuss if they have different opinions. Each place has its own specific circumstances, and the reports published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for everyone's reference.\n              Editor Comrades:\n    We went to Qianbailin and Tuling Villages in the Seventh District of Wu'an on January 24th to inspect winter poverty alleviation and production loans, and returned on February 1st. During these ten days, after in-depth investigations of the poor and hired peasants and promoting the Land Law Outline, we heard some reflections from the masses that there were many problems in both the loans and the village's land reform and cadre situation. In addition to the loan issues being organized into a separate manuscript and sent to the Party newspaper, we believe that these mass reflections are of reference value to the implementation of the Land Law and are also what the poor and hired peasants want to say, so we are sending them to the Party newspaper.\n  Materials from Qianbailin Village\n    (1) Regarding the distribution of the fruits of the struggle in the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947, the masses have the following reflections:\n    In order to expand the cooperative's shares, the village cadres converted the main materials in the floating assets from the fruits of the struggle (including 10,572 catties of grain, 130,000 yuan in cash, 1,413 catties of cotton, 55,000 yuan worth of sheep, 80,000 yuan worth of trees, and 45,000 yuan worth of silverware) into 1,071,790 yuan in total, and invested it in the cooperative in the name of the farmers' association. For a year, it has not been approved and the share certificates have not been distributed to the masses. (This number was learned from the cooperative.) The poor and hired peasants are also dissatisfied with the cooperative, saying that the poor and hired peasants cannot get credit, but the cadres can, and the poor and hired peasants are not given money when they have difficulties. The cooperative cadres also said: The cooperative is not enough to use.\n    When distributing the houses from the fruits of the struggle in the spring of 1947, the political director Liu Engong and the village chief Zhu Shichang both had houses, but they exchanged them for better houses, which the masses were not satisfied with. The saying \"cadres live in brick houses, the masses live in mud caves\" is circulating in the village. This is a common reflection of the poor and hired peasants. However, the poor and hired peasants cannot get good houses. For example, Liu Weitang originally got a better house, but when distributing the houses, he was asked to move to a more dilapidated house.\n    There were ten livestock (three mules, three cows, and four donkeys) in the fruits of the struggle. The village stipulated that priority should be given to family members of soldiers (who would not provide labor after buying), and then to the poor and hired peasants; therefore, nine were bought by family members of soldiers, and only one small donkey was bought by a poor peasant because no family member of soldiers wanted it. The village also used more than 600,000 yuan from the sale of livestock and 416 silver yuan from the fruits of the struggle as funds for militia armed construction (actually for militia production), without distributing them to the masses; (this is on the village's books). Even in the distribution of houses, land, and floating assets, the first and second priorities were for family members of soldiers, followed by the poor and hired peasants. For example, the poor and hired peasant Liu Weitang said: \"Good land, nearby land, good things, and good houses were all given to family members of soldiers, we couldn't get them. I only got six dilapidated houses, a broken cabinet, a pair of vases, and a broken iron pot (three pieces, unusable).\" The land of the poor peasants is mostly far away and in fragmented plots. For example, Liu Risheng has six mu of land, more than three mu are six li away, and more than two mu are three li away. These six mu of land are divided into dozens of plots.\n    (2) Some district and village cadres have great power, oppress the masses, and the poor and hired peasants dare not speak:\n    Last year, when Qianbailin organized a women's factory, the daughter-in-law of the Second Tang (the lover of the public security officer Liu Guozhen) went to mobilize the women next door to the poor peasant Li Jufu to participate in weaving. Li Jufu's wife said to the neighbor's wife (name not remembered): \"We are in the same group, she is a prostitute, don't join her group.\" The Second Tang's daughter-in-law heard this and said to the public security officer Liu Guozhen: \"She is scolding me, you have to stand up for me and arrest her!\" Liu Guozhen used his power as a public security officer and said that Li Jufu's wife was sabotaging the factory, so he arrested Li's wife, detained her for several days, and did not allow the children to see their mother. After Li Jufu asked someone to intercede, he was released on bail.\n    The poor and hired demobilized soldier Guo Tingzi reflected that the political director Liu Engong had been in a relationship with the prostitute woman \"Xiao Kaitong\" for many years (originally the village chief Zhu Shichang was her lover, and the village chief and political director were not united because of her and often bickered). Guo Tingzi caught them in the act nine times. Last summer, the masses held a meeting to confess their mistakes and said that they would guarantee to change in the future. Later, when planting wheat, Guo Tingzi caught them in the act again in the field. At that time, Liu Engong was very scared, kowtowed many times, and promised Guo Tingzi four conditions: 1. Make you a cadre; 2. Give you a better house and better land; 3. Buy you a good mule; 4. Solve all your difficulties. Because of this incident, Liu Engong held a grudge and beat a landlord's wife hard during the struggle, and asked her to confess that she had a relationship with Guo Tingzi.\n    The poor and hired Liu Fuhe's pig ran to the village chief's grandmother's house (family member of a soldier). Liu Fuhe's child went to look for it. The child in the village chief's grandmother's house was hitting the pig, and the two children quarreled a few words. The village chief became angry and said that Liu Fuhe's wife was oppressing the family members of soldiers and beat them, so he arrested Liu Fuhe (when it was the time to harvest and plant wheat). Liu Fuhe's wife was so scared that she asked people to intercede everywhere before he was temporarily released for six days, three days to work for the family members of soldiers, and three days to hurry and harvest the autumn crops before being arrested again. The wheat was not planted at that time. At the same time, Liu Fuhe's wife was in confinement after giving birth. After such an uproar, the child also died. (Liu Fuhe said)\n    When we went to inspect the loans this time, the village cadres initially made noodles for us (we didn't say we wanted to eat) and brought cigarettes. We refused and asked him to send us to the homes of the poor and hired peasants to eat. Because he did not issue the loans, the village cadres (mainly the political director and the head of the cooperative) fabricated a list of loans and convened meetings of each neighborhood, forcing the poor and hired peasants to say that they had received the loans. When we started the investigation, the poor and hired peasants said they had received them. Later, after clarifying the situation, we asked the poor and hired peasants why they told lies. The poor and hired peasants said they were afraid of retaliation from the cadres, being imprisoned, and being labeled. (The village cadres followed behind when we visited the poor and hired peasants.)\n    Guo Benxian, who used to be the district head in Yangyi, is from Qianbailin. The masses said that he was a landlord before (now the masses say that he is a district head in Huixian or Xinxiang, and the cadres of our organization in Bailin Village say that he is in Tangyin). The masses wanted to settle accounts with him, so he was called back last year and gathered the masses in the village. A table was placed on the stage, he sat on the chair, a notebook was placed on the table, and he held a pen in his hand and said to the masses: \"Raise your opinions!\" A poor peasant ×× (name not remembered) said, \"I used to herd sheep for you, you oppressed me and beat me.\" He then distorted the facts and said: \"I didn't beat you, your father beat me. If it weren't for you being a poor and hired peasant, I would have shelled you long ago.\" (Meaning executed). As a result, the masses dispersed in a commotion. At the same time, the village cadres reported that his family members were difficult to deal with. (Li Jufu, Liu Richang, Liu Engong said)\n    (3) Qianbailin Village has a \"poor and hired peasant organization\" controlled by village cadres:\n    When we arrived in Bailin, the village cadres said: \"Last winter, when producing, the poor and hired peasants were identified, and there is a poor and hired peasant organization.\" The village cadres found ten bloodline poor and hired peasants (people who have suffered for many generations) in an erroneous way of \"checking three generations\" to find the poor and hired peasants. They found 64 poor and hired peasant households from the village's original 152 poor and hired peasant households, divided them into eight poor and hired peasant groups, elected group leaders, and designated the director of the farmers' association Liu Rilin (poor peasant) as the acting director of the poor and hired peasants. The village cadres said that the district asked them to identify them, but they did not hold a meeting. When we inspected the loans, the poor and hired peasants reflected that the political director Liu Engong used to be from a declining landlord family, but now he is a well-off middle peasant. Village chief Zhu Shichang worked as a hired laborer before the War of Resistance Against Japan, renting land. After rent reduction, he turned over and is now raising mules and hiring laborers to cultivate 23 mu of good land. When distributing the land last year, he also took out three mu of land. These are not poor and hired peasants, but they are still among the 64 \"poor and hired peasants.\" The masses reflected that nine households in these 64 households are not poor and hired peasants (of which four households are known to be cadres), and they also proposed 13 poor and hired peasant households that are not in the 64 households.\n  Materials from Tuling Village\n    (1) Village cadres protect landlords: Village chief Liang Zhongqing (sound) (feudal landlord, separated from his family and transformed in the year of the War of Resistance Against Japan) and public security officer Zhang Hongshu (sound) (old middle peasant) protect landlord Zhang Tianxiang's sons Zhang Linshu and his brothers; last year, the masses demanded that they be brought back for struggle, they said: \"We are responsible for the whereabouts of these two people; if they are brought back and hang themselves (commit suicide), you are responsible, the cadres are not responsible (because a special agent was brought back and hanged himself once),\" and the masses dared not say anything; Guo Tianliang, Zhang Nianhai, etc. also said that the floating assets and silver of this old rich man have not been fully extracted.\n    (2) Village cadres take more fruits of the struggle, and some district cadres also take away the fruits of the struggle from the masses: Last spring, during the struggle, the fruits were collected by the custody team, and scores were recorded at that time and collected in a large temple. The village cadres said: \"Go and produce and chop firewood!\" and said: \"Everyone who is not a cadre, leave!\" At that time, Li Fenglin, who was in charge of the custody of the fruits, and family members of soldiers (poor and hired Guo Guangji) were present and left after hearing these words; when distributing the fruits, the good things were gone, with a total difference of 100 points, with each point priced at 10,000 yuan. (Li Fenglin, Guo Guangji, Guo Tianliang said)\n    District women cadre Meng Gaiting (from Xijing Village) worked in Tuling Village last year, and became sworn sisters with landlord Zhang Yuanlong's daughter-in-law Tian Lingting, living in his house all day and eating well; the masses reported that they \"ate noodles with meat sauce and lamb dumplings.\" When the masses were distributing the fruits, she took a lot of things, including: a child's silver lock, three silver bracelets, two sheep, three shoe soles, a bamboo basket, a camel hair scarf, six feet of printed cloth, a child's red satin coat, and a weaving shuttle. District cadre Li Youcun took away a quilt cover and a mattress cover. District Armed Committee Director Li Jinnan took away a large piece of glass (gave 500 yuan) and two sheep. His brother is also a district cadre, and he also took a sheep when he passed by Tuling (reflected at the poor and hired peasants' meeting).\n    Village political director Zhang Anfu told us after listening to the Land Law that his family still had two quilts from the fruits that were taken away without going through the farmers' association, and a small temple worth 10,000 yuan that he bought (not yet paid for) and was willing to give them to the masses.\n    (3) Village cadres are undemocratic, the public security officer manipulates the farmers' association, and the masses dare not say anything.\n    The poor and hired Zhang Nianhai constantly gives opinions to the cadres, and the cadres are not satisfied with him. Once, he carried a stretcher to the front line and saw that the bullets of a poor and hired militiaman were unusable, while the bullets of the militiaman from the tail-cutting household were good; he said: \"The cadres are really problematic.\" The cadres heard this and said he was \"sabotaging\" and sent him to the district for detention. The district said that Nianhai was an honest peasant, but in order to save the \"face\" of the village cadres, they asked Nianhai to do odd jobs in the district and stayed for 18 days, and then introduced him back to the village for handling. The village cadres fined him eight days of hard labor and hoed millet for the family members of soldiers for eight days. When we talked to him about the Land Law and the poor and hired peasants being in charge of land redistribution, he said: \"The cadres only say nice things, I am afraid of being deceived; in the past, the cadres asked us to give opinions, we gave them, and after you left, the village cadres retaliated against us.\" After we explained to him that \"now is different from the past,\" he said angrily: \"Your words move me deeply! Others are pressed down by stone slabs, I am pressed down by Mount Tai, hearing these words I just want to shake!\"\n    Liang Ernian said: He used to rent land from the village chief. Last year, when the cadres washed their faces and wiped off the black, he gave the village chief the opinion that \"you oppressed me in the past.\" The village chief remembered this in his heart. When Liang Ernian's wife committed suicide by jumping into a well, he said that Liang Ernian forced his wife to death and struggled against him for two mu of land, four houses, and a vacant courtyard.\n    Guo Tianliang is an activist in the farmers' association. Last year, when he washed the cadres' faces, he discussed giving opinions to the cadres with a peasant. The cadres said he was \"holding a small group meeting\" and sent him to the district for detention for ten days. (Guo Tianliang said)\n    The public security officer has great power and manipulates the farmers' association; whoever he thinks is not good, he expels from the farmers' association. He said this: \"Whoever is not good will be expelled from the farmers' association, it's like a father driving out his son, so you can suffer before coming back!\" Once he expelled more than 30 people from the farmers' association. Guo Guangji (originally a poor peasant, now a new middle peasant) likes to talk about the shortcomings of the cadres, so he has been expelled from the farmers' association four times. The old man said: \"I have 'entered and exited' the farmers' association four times.\" Zhang Qishan was expelled from the farmers' association because the public security officer protected landlord Zhang Tianxiang's nine sheep and he gave opinions. Zhang Nianhai and Guo Tianliang have both been expelled from the farmers' association. (Guo Guangji, Zhang Nianhai, Guo Tianliang, etc. said) -- We didn't say anything when we started talking to the masses, we asked again and again, the masses said: \"We are afraid of being tied up!\" (Hanging them up).\n    (4) District and village cadres are in cahoots: When a cadre comes, they eat the village cadres' noodles and lamb cakes and say nothing; district cadres have never eaten at the homes of the poor and hired peasants (masses reported).\n    (5) The political director distorts the Land Law: On the evening of the 29th, the village cadres returned from a meeting in the district and convened a plenary meeting of the farmers' association to read the Land Law. He read the poor peasant group as \"people's group\" and said \"What is a poor and hired peasant? Everyone here is a poor and hired peasant.\" Comrade Guo Yuzhang (the cadre from our Jinnan Bank Wu'an Branch who inspected the loans) explained to the masses that it was not the \"people's group\" but the \"poor peasant group,\" and explained what a poor and hired peasant is.\n    The above materials are reflections we heard during these ten days of loan work, mostly from conversations with poor and hired peasants. Because the task was to inspect the loans and the time was limited, we did not conduct a detailed investigation and comparison. We wanted to organize the manuscript and send it, but we were afraid that it would be too simple and unclear, so we sent these original materials. If you need to publish it, please excerpt and organize it, otherwise transfer it to the relevant departments. I think it will be helpful to the work?\n    How should such materials be organized to be suitable? I hope you can tell us when you have time, so that we can do it in the future.\n        Sincerely,\n              Wang Peizhang, Zhang Zhiyong, Yu Zhi\n              Comrades Peizhang, Zhiyong, and Yu Zhi:\n    Your materials are very well written; just write down and send us the materials you have investigated according to the facts, without being restricted by any form.\n    In addition, the last paragraph of the Qianbailin Village material, which says to only use the method of \"comparing history and comparing time\" to check class composition, is inappropriate, so it has been deleted.\n               --Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 很多村干部作风不民主  群众受欺压翻身没翻透\n王裴璋  张智勇  于志\n1948-02-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    很多村干部作风不民主\n    群众受欺压翻身没翻透\n    我们以最大的篇幅，欢迎边区各地参加平分土地工作的同志们交流工作情况，交换工作意见，研究工作问题，集中多方面意见然后加以共同解决。系统的也好，片断的也好，材料也好，心得也好；用写文章的形式也好，写信的形式也好，写通讯记日记的形式也好，不拘什么形式都好，把要说的话写出来就可以；千万不要党八股客里空。别的同志有不同的意见，也可以写信来讨论。一个地方有一个地方的具体情况，这里发表的通讯不一定对每个地方都适用，但可供大家参考。\n              编辑同志：\n    我们于一月二十四日到武安七区前柏林及土岭村检查冬季贫雇生产贷款，于二月一日返回。在这十天当中，经深入贫雇调查及宣传土地法大纲，听到一些群众反映，不论在贷款上及村中土改、干部情况上都存在着不少问题，除有关贷款问题另外整理稿子寄交党报外，我们认为这些群众反映，对土地法实行上有参考价值，同时也是贫雇要说的话，因此寄给党报。\n  前柏林村的材料\n    （一）在一九四六年冬及四七年春斗争果实分配上，群众有如下的几点反映：\n    村干为了扩大合作社股金，将斗争果实浮财中的主要物资（内计粮食一万零五百七十二斤，现款十三万元，棉花一千四百一十三斤，羊折价五万五千元，树折价八万元，银器折价四万五千元）折价一百零七万一千七百九十元，以农会名义入股合作社，一年来未批红也未把股金票分配给群众。（这个数目是从合作社中了解的。）贫雇对合作社也不满意，说贫雇不能赊欠，干部能赊欠，贫雇有困难也不借给钱，合作社干部还说：合作社还不够用哩。\n    四七年春分配斗争果实的房子时，政治主任刘恩功、村长朱世昌都有房子，但换了好宅子，群众不满意。村中流传着“干部住的砖圪顶，群众住的坯圪洞”。这是贫雇共同的反映。而贫雇却分不上好房子，如刘维堂原来分到的房子较好，分配房子时叫他搬到较破的一所宅子去。\n    斗争果实中有十个牲口（计骡三、牛三、驴四），村中规定先尽抗属买，并按作价七折（抗属买后不代耕），其次才是贫雇；因此九个就被抗属买去，只有一个小驴，抗属没人要了，才叫贫农买了。村中并将牲口卖价六十余万元及果实中的银元四百一十六元，作为民兵武装建设费（实际是民兵生产用），未分给群众；（这是村中在帐的）。即连房、地、浮财分配上，头等二等都是抗属，次为贫雇。例如贫雇刘维堂说：“好地、近地、好东西、好宅子都分给了抗属，咱分不上，我只分了六间破房，一个破柜、一对花瓶、一个破铁锅（三块，不能用）。”贫农的地多是远地碎块地，如刘日升有六亩地，一去六里远的三亩多，一去三里远的二亩多，这六亩多地就有数十块。\n    （二）某些区村干部权利大，欺压群众，贫雇不敢说话：\n    去年前柏林组织妇女工厂时，二唐子媳妇（公安员刘国珍的相好的）去动员贫农李聚富邻家的妇女参加纺织，李聚富老婆向邻家妇女（名字记不清了）说：“咱们一组，她是破鞋，不参加她那组”。被二唐子媳妇听到，她就和公安员刘国珍说：“她骂我，你要给我出气，得扣起她来！”刘国珍就以公安员权力说李聚富老婆破坏工厂，就把李妻扣起来，扣了几天，也不让小孩见她娘，经李聚富托人说情找保才放出来。\n    贫雇荣退军人郭廷子反映，政治主任刘恩功和破鞋妇女“小开通”多年有关系（原来村长朱世昌和她相好，村长、政治主任因她而不团结，经常斗气）。只郭廷子捉奸就捉住九次。去年夏天群众开会坦白了，并说今后保证改掉。后来种麦子时，在地里又被郭廷子捉住，当时刘恩功很害怕，磕了很多头，并允许郭廷子四个条件：一、叫你当干部；二、给你换好宅子好地；三、给你买一匹好骡子；四、大小困难都解决。因此事刘恩功记恨在心，在斗争一家地主女人时，硬打她，叫她招认和郭廷子有关系。\n    贫雇刘福河的小猪跑到村长姥姥家（抗属），刘福河的小孩去找，正值他家的小孩向外打猪，两个小孩争吵了几句，村长就不行了，说刘福河老婆欺压抗属，打抗属了，就把刘福河扣起来，（正在收秋种麦的时候）吓的刘福河老婆到处托人说情，才暂时放出六天来，其中三天给抗属作活，三天急急忙忙收了秋又扣起来，麦子当时也未种上。同时刘福河老婆正值产后坐月子，经过这样一闹，小孩也死了。（刘福河谈）\n    我们这次去检查贷款，村干一开始给我们做了面条（我们并未说吃饭），拿上了纸烟，我们拒绝了，叫他派到贫雇家去吃饭。因为他未把款贷出，村干（主要是政治主任和合作社长两人）假造贷款名单，并召开各闾会，强叫贫雇说把款贷到手中；我们开始调查时，贫雇都说贷了；后来弄清，问贫雇为什么说假话，贫雇说怕干部打击报复，怕坐禁闭，怕戴帽子。（我们访问贫雇时，村干后面跟着。）\n    原来在阳邑当区长的郭本贤是前柏林人，群众说先前他是地主（现在群众说他在辉县或新乡当区长，我们机关柏林村的干部说他在汤阴），群众要向他清算，去年叫回来，召集了村中的群众，台上放一棹子，他坐在椅子上，棹上放了记录本，手中拿着钢笔，和群众说：有意见提吧！贫农××（名字记不清了）说，我从前给你放羊，你压迫我，打过我。他随之歪曲事实说：“我未打你，你父亲打了我，象你这样说，如不是贫雇的话，我非炮了你不可。”（意思是枪毙）。这样一来，群众都一哄而散了。同时，村干反映他的家属很难惹。（李聚富、刘日常、刘恩功谈）\n    （三）前柏林村有村干掌握的“贫雇组织”：\n    我们到柏林时，村干说：去年冬季生产时划了贫雇，有贫雇组织，是村干部找了十个血统贫雇（多辈受苦的人）以错误的“查三代”的方式来找贫雇，他们从村中原有的一百五十二户贫雇农当中找了六十四户贫雇，分成八个贫雇小组，都选出了小组长，并指定农会主任刘日林（贫农）代理贫雇主任，村干说是区上叫划的，但未开过会。当我们检查贷款时，贫雇反映：政治主任刘恩功，从前是地主破落下来的，现在时光是富裕中农。村长朱世昌，抗战前当长工，种租子地，减租后翻了身，现在喂着骡子，雇着长工种二十三亩好地，去年分配土地时，还拿出了三亩地。这都不是贫雇，但他们还在六十四户“贫雇”当中。群众反映，这六十四户中九户不是贫雇（其中已知者有四户是干部），并又提出不在六十四户之内的贫雇十三户。\n  土岭村的材料\n    （一）村干部包庇地主：村长梁中庆（音）（封建地主，抗战那一年分家化形）公安员张宏书（音）（老中农）包庇地主张天祥的儿子张林书等弟兄二人；去年群众要求弄回斗争，他俩说：“这两人的下落我们负责；如弄回来上吊死了（自杀）你们负责，干部不负责（因为曾有一个特务弄回来上吊死了），群众就不敢吭了；郭天亮、张年泰等还说这家老财的浮财银子还未斗出来。\n    （二）村干部多占果实，还有些区干部拿走群众果实：去年春斗争时，果实是由保管组收集的，当时就登记分数，收集到一个大庙里。村干部说：“你们去生产砍柴吧！”并说：“不是干部的都走吧！”当时保管果实的李凤林和抗属（贫雇郭广吉）都在场，听到这话就走了；到分果实时，好东西没有了，共差一百分，每分作价一万元。（李凤林、郭广吉、郭天亮谈）\n    区上妇女干部孟改廷（西井村人）去年在土岭村作工作，和地主张元龙的儿媳田玲廷拜干姊妹，整天住在他家，吃好的；群众反映是“吃面条肉卤羊肉饺子”。在群众分配果实时，她要了很多东西，计有：小孩银锁子一把，银手镯三只，羊二只，鞋底子三双，竹篮一个，驼毛好围巾一条，花布六尺，小孩红缎子大衣一件，织布梭一个。区干部李有存拿走被子面一件，褥子面一件，区武委会主任李金南拿走了大玻璃一块（给了五百元），羊二只。他兄弟也是区干部，路过土岭也要走一只羊（贫雇会上反映的）。\n    村政治主任张安福听了土地法以后向我们说，他家还有果实中的两床被子是未经过农会拿去的，另有一万元买的小庙一座（还未付款）都愿给了群众。\n    （三）村干不民主，公安员操纵农会，群众不敢吭。\n    贫雇张年泰不断给干部提意见，干部不满意他。一次他抬担架到前方，见一贫雇民兵子弹都不能用，而割尾巴户民兵子弹好；他说：“干部真成问题”，干部听到后说他是“破坏”，送到区里禁闭。区里说年泰是老实农民，但为了转转村干的“面子”，叫年泰在区上作零活，住了十八天，然后又介绍回村处理，村干又罚他八天苦工，给抗属锄了八天谷子。当我们向他谈土地法平分土地贫雇当家时，他说：“干部光说漂亮话，我上当上怕了；从前干部叫咱提意见，我们提了，你们走了村干又打击咱。经我们向他解释“现在和从前不一样了”。以后，他气愤的说：你说这话我心中直动，人家是石板压着，我是泰山，听到这话我只想圪动！\n    梁二年说：他过去租种过村长的地，在去年干部洗脸擦黑时他给村长提意见说“你过去压迫过我”，村长记在心，趁梁二年老婆跳井自杀时，说梁二年逼死老婆，斗争了他二亩地、四间房、一处闲院。\n    郭天亮是农会积极分子，去年给干部洗脸时，他和一个农民商量着给干部提意见，干部说他是“开小组会”，送到区上扣了十来天。（郭天亮谈）\n    公安员权利大操纵农会；他看着谁不好就开除农会，他这样说：“谁不好就下了他的农会，这好比老子赶出儿子去，叫你受受再回来！”有一次下了三十多人的农会。郭广吉（原为贫农，现为新中农）好说干部的短处，就下过四次农会，老汉谈起来说：“我参加农会已‘四进四出’了。”张其善因公安员包庇地主张天祥的九只羊，提了意见，就给下了农会。张年泰、郭天亮都被下过农会。（郭广吉、张年泰、郭天亮等谈）——我们开始和群众谈时都不吭，问来问去，群众说：“怕上梁！”（吊起来）。\n    （四）区村干部一气：来个干部一吃上村干部的拉面、羊肉圪塔就不吭了；区干部没有到贫雇家吃过饭（群众反映）。\n    （五）政治主任歪曲土地法：二十九日晚上，村干由区上开会回来，召开农会全体会读土地法，他把贫农团念作“人民团”，并说“什么是贫雇呢，咱们到会的都是贫雇”。郭玉章同志（我们冀南银行武安支行检查贷款的干部）当天就向群众解释了不是“人民团”，是“贫农团”，并解释了啥叫贫雇。\n    以上这些材料是我们在这十天贷款工作中听到的反映，多是和贫雇谈话中听到的。因任务是检查贷款，时间有所限制，并未作详细的调查对照。本想整理稿子寄去，又怕简单了弄不清，为此将这些原始材料寄上，如需登出，请摘录整理，否则转有关部门。想对工作定有一些帮助吧？\n    象这样的材料如何整理才适合？报社的要求望有暇见告，以便以后照办。  \n        此致敬礼\n              王裴璋、张智勇、于志\n              裴璋、智勇、于志同志：\n    你们这个材料写的很好；调查到什么材料，照事实写下来寄给我们就可以，不必拘泥什么形式。\n    另外，前柏林村材料最后一段所说只用“比历史、比时光”的方式查阶级成份，是不妥当的，所以删去了。\n               ——编者"

    "content": "Coming from Workers and Peasants, Returning to Workers and Peasants\nComrade Wang Yizhi Reflects on Forgetting His Roots\nOne of the Reflections at the Rectification Meeting of the Sixth District Committee\nComrade Wang Yizhi is from Dongzhuang Village, Third District, Pingshun, born into a poor peasant family. He started working in 1943, joined the Party in October 1945, and is currently the Deputy Secretary of the First District Committee of Cixian County.\n\n    My family is from Dongzhuang Village, Pingshun. My father always farmed and reclaimed mountains, working as a farmhand for others. There were more than twenty people in the family, and we owed a lot of debt. When I was five years old, I and my uncles separated from my grandfather’s family. My parents, my younger brother, and I had four people, four sheng of rice, three huts (my grandfather still occupied one), and half a mu of dry land, relying on my father to sell his labor to make a living. When the harvest was bad, we couldn't make ends meet, so we took 32 yuan of silver from the landlord Wang Shaozhong and Liu Shichang, and more than two shi of grain from the landlord's granary. Everything we divided was used to pay interest, and the land was mortgaged. When I was ten years old, I and my father herded livestock for others. Later, I had a younger brother and a younger sister, and they also herded cattle. I herded cattle for fifteen years until 1943 when no one needed me anymore. My father starved to death. I herded cattle for ten years, and when the cattle died, the landlord scolded me terribly, so I stopped herding cattle. After the age of twenty, I became a village clerk, learned to write in ten months, and then served as village head for more than two years. At the age of twenty-four, I went out to work (in 1943) and joined the Communist Party in 1945.\n    In my work, I liked to show off, express myself, pursue formalism, and pay attention to superficial forms. Wherever I worked, I first wanted to put on a show on the surface. After a grievance meeting, my class consciousness became clearer. When I first arrived in Nanguan, Cixian County, to do rent reduction work, I looked for broken houses to live in and approached poor people. Because the living standards in the city were high, and my own living standards changed, I forgot my roots, forgot that I used to eat chaff and suffer. The idea of enjoying life gradually developed. For example, when I got married, the village cadres gave gifts. At first, I didn't want them, but it wasn't because I consciously realized that I was a Communist Party member and shouldn't take things from the people, but because I was afraid of making mistakes and being criticized by my superiors. The cadres said it again and again, and I always said no on the surface. The cadres went to the school and talked to Director Li. Later, Director Li said that they insisted on giving, so I should take some. I accepted the superior's words, felt it was legitimate, and accepted some things from the cadres, some were fruits, and some were bought by the cadres themselves. After getting married, I wanted to go home and see my mother, using the excuse of seeing my mother, but actually wanting everyone to see that I was married. Later, I asked my superiors, and Comrade Chai Shouyue said: Let your mother move here to live. I chatted with other comrades in this way, which suited my intentions. I wanted to move my mother here to live and divide some paddy fields for my younger brother to cultivate, so that he could have a better life than in the mountains. So I divided two mu and three fen of land. I wrote two letters to my mother, but she didn't come, so I asked the people to cultivate the land for me to support my wife's schooling, exploiting the labor of the people, entirely for my personal enjoyment, regardless of the suffering of the masses. When I saw a lot of good fruits in Xingli Street, I envied them, but I didn't want to be caught taking them, fearing criticism from my superiors, so I avoided going to the fruits. This avoided the phenomenon of grabbing a handful. In the end, I still grabbed a little and returned it when resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses. Seeing that everyone else was riding bicycles, but I didn't have one, I got a bicycle from a fleeing landlord when I worked in Xingren Street and rode it around. Seeing Secretary Xie salute at the meeting, I didn't learn from his good experience, but only learned his superficial form. When I became the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, I immediately made a military uniform to use at the meeting, wanting the masses to look up to me. When distributing fruits in Xingli Street, I didn't go deep into the poor people to understand the situation, but only listened to the words of the cadres and activists. In order to put on a good show in form, I produced personal heroism and serious sectarianism. Everyone at the meeting was raised to a higher level, and everyone not at the meeting was lowered to a lower level. Family members of those at the meeting who were not at the meeting were also lowered by one level. Except for the objects of struggle, landlords and rich peasants, all dependents of martyrs were raised by one level. Cadres and militiamen were given an extra share. Believing that the work was led and done by me, and that the cadres were trained by me, I only trusted them and myself, followed the rich peasant line, and the poor and hired peasants have not yet been thoroughly liberated. When expanding the army in Xingli Street, I didn't get a banner, so I expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership. The masses saw me expressing opinions and believed me, and they were also dissatisfied with the leadership. Later, I made another banner, and I was very happy, running to Nanguan to give the cadres good news. Looking at it today, I actually played the role of leading factionalism. In Dunhua Street, although party member Zhao ×× was born into a poor peasant family, he later degenerated, sheltered landlords, and occupied more fruits. District Chief Dai criticized him, and I felt that he was a party member and shouldn't be treated that way. I even explained to him: He doesn't understand you, he doesn't know you are a party member. This kind of education made him feel that party members are a head higher than the masses, blurred the truth of criticism and self-criticism within the party, created a factionalism between the party and the masses, and alienated us from the masses. Where I worked, the cadres I trained only thought he was good and couldn't see his shortcomings. I praised him a lot and promoted him a lot, wanting everyone to see that he was a cadre I trained. If he had shortcomings, I criticized him behind his back, fearing that everyone would see that my cadre was not good, and I would not be glorious either. When it came to the joint defense work, I only cared about that joint defense, regardless of the overall situation. Making the area I controlled good was my leadership's credit. I only helped and praised the cadres there a lot, thinking they were making rapid progress, which was my personal glory, instead of proceeding from the interests of the revolution. I engaged in textile production in order to create a typical example, to show everyone how capable I was, instead of solving the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. After it started, I mobilized all the villages to come and see, thinking that I did it, it was really amazing. As a result, two groups borrowed 400,000 yuan from the cooperative, and the difficulties of the entire poor and hired peasants in the village were still not solved. I regarded the Party as a sectarian group, using the Party to maintain my own reputation and status. With all the above ideas of planning for personal fame and fortune, I forgot my roots, forgot the poor and hired peasants, and blurred my class consciousness. For example, my wife was a maid for a landlord and suffered a lot of oppression. There was a landlord's daughter-in-law who lived with my wife. Although I told my wife and the village cadres: She is a landlord, she can't be of one heart with us; but in fact, for my own benefit, feeling that my wife was young, and in order to have her take care of my wife, I actually lived with her. The masses saw her living with my family and didn't fight her, and she became her \"air-raid shelter.\" Last autumn, I felt it was inappropriate and separated from her, but I didn't realize that I had already become the landlord's \"air-raid shelter.\" Only this time, I clarified this issue and realized that I had lost my stance. After autumn, Comrade ××× married the landlord's daughter Xie Ruying. I talked to him and learned that her history was not good. Her brother had run to the south, and she was a landlord. I raised objections to him. But he said it was nothing, she couldn't shake me. The superior also agreed. I also wanted to make a good impression on him, so I didn't proceed from class interests, didn't stand firm on my position, and compromised with him, losing my position, and helping him become the landlord's \"air-raid shelter,\" causing dissatisfaction among the masses and opposition from cadres at all levels, and damaging the Party's reputation. This study has given me a preliminary understanding of the personal heroism in my work, which is entirely for my own enjoyment and fame, producing a serious sectarian style of thought, endangering the interests of the poor and hired peasant class. This time, I will resolutely return the things (fruits) taken from the masses to the masses, admit my mistakes to the masses, sincerely accept the criticism of the masses, and in the future, I will honestly stand on the Party's position, humbly learn from the masses, and be a farmhand for the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 来自工农回到工农  王一之同志反省忘本思想  六地委整党会上反省之一\n\n1948-02-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    来自工农回到工农\n    王一之同志反省忘本思想\n    六地委整党会上反省之一\n    王一之同志，平顺三区东庄村人，贫雇出身，四三年参加工作，四五年十月入党，现任磁县一区分委副书记。\n    我家是平顺东庄村人。父亲一直种地开山，给别人代种地。家有二十来口人，欠人家外债很多。我五岁上就和伯父叔父分了家，有父母、我和弟弟四口人，分了四升米，三间平房（还叫祖父占一间），半亩旱地，依靠父亲卖劳力维持生活。年景不好，顾不住，揭了地主王绍中、刘世昌三十二元现洋，又揭仓谷和地主的谷子两石多，把家里分的东西都打了利，地被押了。我十岁上就和我父亲给人揽牲口放，以后有了一个弟弟、一个妹妹，也是放牛。一直放到四三年，没人用才不放了，一共放了十五年。父亲饿死了。我放牛十年，给人家跌死牛，老财骂的不行，我不放牛了。二十岁以后当了村公所通讯员，十个月学会写字，又当村长二年多，二十四岁出来参加了工作（一九四三年），一九四五年参加共产党。\n    我在工作中好出风头，表现自己，锦标主义，讲究表面形式。到哪里工作，首先就想在表面搞一套。经过一次诉苦，阶级觉悟比较有些明确。刚到磁县南关做减租工作，还找破房子住，接近的都是穷人。因城市生活水平高，自己生活水平改变了，就忘了本，忘记了自己从前吃糠菜受罪，享乐思想逐渐的发展起来。如结婚时村干部给送礼，首先不要，但思想也不是自觉到自己是个共产党员，不应要老百姓的东西，而是怕犯了错误，受上级批评。干部再三说，自己表面上总是说不要。干部到学校找李主任说，后来李主任说他们非给不行就要些吧，自己接了上级这个口气，就感觉合法了，就收了干部一些东西，有的是果实，有的是干部自买的。结婚后就想和老婆回家看看，借口是看母亲，但实际上是叫大家看看我结了婚啦。以后向上级要求，柴守约同志说：叫你母亲搬在这里住吧，向别的同志闲扯也这样说，就合了自己的意，想把母亲搬这里住，分些水地叫弟弟种，比在山里过的时光更好些，于是就分了二亩三分地。给母亲写了二次信，结果没来，就把地叫老百姓给代耕，供给自己老婆上学，剥削老百姓的劳力，完全为了个人享受打算，就不顾群众的痛苦了。在兴礼街看到好果实很多，就羡慕，但不愿落个抓取果实，怕上级批评，只好不到果实边去看，这样避免自己抓一把现象。结果还抓了一点，解决干群关系时才退回去。看人家都骑车子，自己没有，到兴仁街工作就搞了逃亡地主个车子，游游荡荡的就骑开了。看谢政委开会讲话敬礼，我不学人家好的经验，光学他的表面形式，我当了分委书记，马上做了一身军装，准备开会使用，想叫群众看起我。在兴理街分果实，不深入贫苦人了解情况，光听干部积极分子的话，为落我能在形式上搞一套的好，产生了个人英雄和严重的宗派主义思想。凡在会的人都提高一等，不在会的都降低一等。在会的人家属不在会也降低一等。除地主富农斗争对象外，凡抗属都加一等。干部民兵多分一份。认为工作是我领导搞的，干部是我培养的，光相信他们和自己，走了富农路线，使贫雇到现在还未得到彻底翻身。在兴礼街扩兵没得到锦标，就对领导上提出不满意见，群众看到我提意见就相信我，也对领导不满。后来又重做了一个锦标，自己就很高兴，跑到南关给干部报喜信。今天看，我实际起了领导宗派的作用。在敦化街党员赵××虽贫雇出身，以后蜕化了，包庇地主，多占果实，戴区长批评了他一顿，我就感到是党员，不应当。还给他解释说：他对你不了解，不知你是个党员，这样教育使他感到党员都比群众高一头，在党内模糊了批评和自我批评的真理，造成党与群众的宗派，脱离群众。我在那里工作，培养的干部只认为他好，看不出他的毛病，对他表扬也多，提拔也多，叫大家看看是我培养的干部。有了缺点在背地批评他，怕大家看见我的干部不好，自己也不光荣。到那个联防工作，只对那个联防关心，不顾全面，把我霸的一块搞好，是我领导的功劳。只对那里干部帮助多，表扬多，觉得他们进步快，是我个人的光荣，而不是从革命利益出发。搞纺织是为了搞个典型，叫大家看看我有多能干，而不是为解决贫雇困难，搞起以后就发动各村都来看，心想是我搞的，实在了不起，结果两个小组就在合作社贷了四十万元，村上整个贫雇的困难，还是没有解决。我把党看成一个宗派集团，利用党来维护自己的名誉地位。有了以上一切为个人名利打算的想法，就忘了本，忘了贫雇，模糊了自己的阶级意识。如我老婆是地主的使女，很受压迫，有个地主的儿媳，与我老婆在一块生活，我虽和我老婆及村干部说：她是地主，不能和咱一条心；但实际上为自己利益打算，感到自己老婆小，为叫她给照管老婆，竟和她在一块生活。群众看见与我家在一块就没把她斗了，结果当了她的“防空洞”。去年秋天感到不合适，与她分离了，但并没认识到已做了地主的“防空洞”，这次学习才明确了这个问题，是丧失立场的。秋后×××同志和地主女儿谢如英结婚，我和他谈话，了解到她历史不好，她哥跑到南边了，又是地主成份，就给他提出不同意见。但他说没啥，她动摇不了我。上级也同意了。自己也想在他面前落好，就不从阶级利益出发，不坚定自己的立场，向他妥协，丧失了自己的立场，帮他当了地主的“防空洞”，造成了群众不满，各级干部反对，损害了党的名誉。这次学习，初步认识了我在工作中的个人英雄主义，是完全为了自己享乐名利出发，产生了严重的宗派主义思想作风，违害了贫雇阶级利益。这次回去要把抓取群众的东西（果实），坚决退给群众，向群众承认错误，诚心诚意的接受群众的批评，今后要老老实实站在党的立场上，虚心向群众学习，给人民当一个长工。"

Moscow Radio broadcast an article from the Soviet \"New Times Weekly\" on the 14th, commenting on the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Winter Offensive, titled \"Battles Near Nanjing.\" It stated: \"The People's Liberation Army is successfully carrying out its Winter Offensive in the Kuomintang areas. In Manchuria, it will force Chiang Kai-shek's generals to withdraw from Jilin and Changchun. The battle to capture Xinlitun dealt a heavy blow to Shenyang, the main base of the Kuomintang in Northeast China. On the Hebei battlefield, the People's Liberation Army is operating directly near Beiping, Baoding, and Tianjin.\" The article went on to point out that the activities and battles of the PLA in the vast area between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River \"are of particular significance. As a result of the large-scale offensive launched here, new liberated areas have been established in the vast area north to the Longhai Railway, west to the Pinghan Railway, and east to the Jinpu Railway (west of the Pinghan Railway, there are also the Yu-Shaan-E and Tongbai, Jianghan Military Regions—editor). Relying on this vast base area, the People's Liberation Army and the militia, in their joint operations in December and January, have inflicted many major blows on the Kuomintang forces operating in the area and have broken through their entire defense system. Zhengzhou, where the headquarters of the Kuomintang army is located, is besieged.\" After describing the PLA's capture of the important military bases of Xuchang, Luohe, and Zhumadian, and the annihilation of more than 30,000 Kuomintang troops, it added: \"On January 18, after breaking through the Kuomintang army's front line in the Dabie Mountains, the People's Liberation Army advanced to the vicinity of Wuhan, a huge industrial center. At the same time, the PLA troops operating in Jiangsu inflicted powerful blows on the Kuomintang troops dispatched from Gaoyou and other strongholds, and then advanced to the vicinity of Nanjing, surrounding the city of Liuhe, 35 kilometers northeast of Nanjing. Moreover, fighting is taking place near Taixing and Taixian on the north bank of the Yangtze River, 100 kilometers from Shanghai.\" The article concluded: \"Thus, it seems that in the course of the Winter Offensive, the People's Liberation Army has broken through the entire defense system of the Kuomintang army in Manchuria, North China, and Central China, and has gained strategic positions for striking at the main political centers of the Kuomintang-controlled areas.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联广播评我冬季攻势  击破蒋匪东北华北华中整个防御体系  取得了痛击蒋匪政治中心的战略基地\n\n1948-02-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    苏联广播评我冬季攻势\n    击破蒋匪东北华北华中整个防御体系\n    取得了痛击蒋匪政治中心的战略基地\n    【新华社陕北十日电】莫斯科电台十四日广播苏联“新时代周刊”评论中国人民解放军的冬季攻势一文，题为“南京附近的战事”。里面说：“人民解放军在国民党区域内顺利的开展着冬季攻势。在满洲将使蒋介石的将军迫不得已退出吉林和长春，占领新立屯之战，给了国民党东北的主要基地——沈阳以痛击。在河北战场上，人民解放军直接在北平、保定和天津附近作战。”该文继指出解放军在黄河和长江之间广大区域内的活动与作战，“具有特别意义。在这里发动的庞大攻势之结果，已在北至陇海、西至平汉、东至津浦的广大地区内，建立了新的解放区，（平汉路以西还有豫陕鄂和桐柏、江汉军区——编者）依靠这个广大根据地，解放军和民兵在十二月与一月的联合作战中，已给予在当地作战之国民党兵力以许多重大打击，并击破了他的整个防御系统。国民党军总部的所在地郑州被围困了。”在叙述解放军占领重要军事基地许昌、漯河和驻马店，歼灭了国民党军三万多人后，又说：“一月十八日解放军在突破国民党军在大别山的战线后，已推进到了巨大工业中心汉口附近，同时在江苏作战的解放军部队，给了从高邮和其他据点出动的国民党军以强大打击之后，进抵南京附近，包围了南京东北三十五公里的六合城。而且在距离上海一百公里的长江北岸的泰兴和泰县附近战斗。”该文最后称：“这样看来，人民解放军在冬季攻势进程中，已击破了国民党军在满洲、华北和华中的整个防御系统，取得了痛击国民党统治区主要政治中心点的战略阵地。”"

    "content": "[Report from this newspaper] Systematically and thoroughly understanding the situation of a village is not easy. In the past, investigation work often relied on cadres and activists, and the materials obtained, though seemingly systematic, were often largely untrue. Recently, some cadres in Wu'an Zhao Village visited poor peasants and hired laborers and obtained some materials from casual conversations. This is not comprehensive or specific enough. From the perspective of seriously using class methods to understand a village's situation, this is only a preliminary attempt; however, it has revealed the basic situation of the village. The basic situation is that although landlords have been basically defeated, cadres and activists are replacing the masses, the work style is extremely bad, and the distribution of fruits is unfair. The preliminary results of the investigation are reported as follows:\n\nZhao Village is a large village in the Ninth District of Wu'an, reportedly with good work and few problems. The whole village has 688 households, 2,108 people, and over 7,700 mu of land. Before the War of Resistance, land was highly concentrated, and the number of poor peasants and hired laborers was very large. The landless and land-poor had three ways out: first, working in flour mills (there were many flour mills in the village); second, going to the Northeast to sell their labor (carrying water, going down coal mines); and third, working as farmhands in this village or other villages.\n\nThe old rulers were the Jin family's two brothers (Jin Gaokui, Jin Gaorui), who were landlords and store owners, with the Yongmaode and Yongmaoxiang commercial firms. Villagers often called these two commercial firms to refer to the two people by name. They, along with Zhao Wenhua, Zhao Quanming, Li Qingwang, Zhao Shunxing and smaller leaders, used the shrine and Baojia system to control the whole village. In addition, there was a larger landlord named Zhao Shunfa, who once had 1,400 mu of land and also had stores in Yangyi, but most of his land and commercial firms were not in this village, so he was not very interested in village power (during rent reduction and debt clearing, his properties were calculated by various villages).\n\nIn the autumn of 1937, when the Japanese invaders occupied the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang's defeated troops fled into the Taihang Mountains (all using the designation of the 53rd Army). The old order was in chaos (in Wu'an County alone, there were eighteen miscellaneous commanders at the same time). The village also suffered greatly, and the villagers' movable property (including landlords and rich peasants) suffered great losses. Later, the Japanese invaders and Zhu Huaibing's troops came to harass the village from time to time, until 1941 (one year after Zhu Huaibing was eliminated) when our public regime began to exist.\n\nBefore our regime was made public (the year is unknown), our Party and armed forces were already active. The village also organized the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, guerrilla groups, and a Party branch. However, this branch was dissolved because it collectively accepted bribes from landlords (only one Party member named Jin Deyuan was retained, who is now working in the Political Department of the Military Region). When reorganizing after the dissolution, a cautious attitude was adopted, and development was very slow. At the beginning, there were only six people: Jin Mantun (deceased), Li Sugen (deceased), Tian Dongfang, Yang Zhankui, Zhao Xi, and Jin Deyuan. Soon, two former Party members who had been suspended (Jin Caiyuan, Li Bugui) were also absorbed, making a total of eight people.\n\nOn the eighth day of the fourth lunar month of 1941, when the enemy came to sweep the village, everyone fled, and the Jin family's two brothers and all the old rulers organized a maintenance association, bared their fangs and claws, and slaughtered pigs to entertain guests. The Party, the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, and the guerrilla groups were ordered to wipe out their gang and send them to the Wu'an West County Government. From then on, their open political forces were basically defeated. Although they still had activities afterward, they dared not show their faces publicly.\n\nBefore the rent reduction and interest reduction in 1942, a village-wide self-reporting of grain and deposits was launched to solve the burden problem. The landlords felt the increasing pressure and sold off inferior land in large quantities in an attempt to change their class status. Some land was acquired by the landless and land-poor. In the same year, when rent reduction and debt clearing began, people who had rental relationships with landlords also obtained some land and grain, and the landlord class was greatly weakened economically. However, because the area was too close to the enemy, the traitorous forces still colluded with the landlords in the village and established three or four kinds of gangs and superstitious groups to confuse the masses. Soon (more than a year later), we successively cracked them down.\n\nAt that time, the implementation of the United Front policy was a little too rightist, and the landlords were still able to use legal protection to hide themselves. Jin Yaohua, the son of Jin Gaorui (Yongmaoxiang), was the principal of a senior primary school in the county. During the rent reduction and debt clearing, he engaged in open reasoning struggles with the masses, and the masses could do nothing about it. Primary school teachers Liu ×× and Zhang Ganzhou established an education association in the village to secretly develop Kuomintang organizations in order to support the latent forces of the landlords in the village.\n\nIn the great famine of 1943, many middle peasants and below fled and scattered, and many young adults went to the Northeast, and many died abroad or their whereabouts were unknown, and some starved to death at home. At this time, although the government issued relief grain, the village cadres were undemocratic, a few people exercised dictatorship, and the poor and powerless could not receive it, while the cooperative (the grain distribution agency) and its relevant personnel could all eat and drink freely. After the famine, it took one or two years for the people who fled to slowly return. The work in the village improved a little after the people who made mistakes in the famine relief work (Jin Caiyuan, etc.) were punished and replaced (not thoroughly). Later, after a review and settlement of accounts according to the problems, and an equal distribution of the fruits, the masses received some additional compensation.\n\nFrom the beginning of the work until before the May 4th Directive, the work in the village was only about the single-handed cadres fighting with the landlords. After defeating the landlords' advantage, they learned their work style to rule over other masses. Although the district-level officials made corrections, the corrections were not thorough. Several old Party members and old cadres have not changed much even now.\n\nAfter the May 4th Directive, the village has carried out four or five struggles (including the anti-spy struggle), each more intense than the last. It was not until the last one in the autumn of last year that the old nest of feudal forces was basically wiped out. However, the landlords who were relatives and friends of the cadres were still not thoroughly struggled against. In terms of the new forces, the number of Party members has increased to 47 (now there are 39 left after those who have joined the army or left for other reasons), and there are also 40 or 50 activists (non-cadre Party members), who are the team that executes the May 4th Directive (the majority of whom are poor peasants and hired laborers).\n\nThese people have long formed an opposition to the landlords in history, so they are active in confiscating land and floating wealth, but in the last one or two times, they expanded the scope of the struggle and mistakenly expanded the rich peasants into the targets of the struggle. The reason for this has not yet been clearly studied, it may be in order to increase the fruits, or it may be political hatred.\n\nIn terms of the distribution of fruits, the principle is to fill the gaps and make up for deficiencies, but in fact the land has achieved the form of filling the gaps (each person should produce more than five dan of grain), but in essence there are still differences: (1) Cadres generally have high yields. Zhao Hengshu, a member of the Peasants' Association, has nine mu of good nearby land, with a yield of more than twenty dan. (2) Families of revolutionary soldiers are generally taken care of excessively, and are given more good land near the village. Zhao Hengyi's family of six has 37.5 mu of land, with a yield of more than 11 dan per person, mostly good nearby land. (3) Non-cadre activists and non-revolutionary soldiers' families get land of poor quality and large acreage. Although they have the same yield, the loss of work is great, and there are still deficits. Jin Tingquan has nine mu of land, which is far and bad, and he can't even exchange it for two mu of someone else's land. According to the statistics of three villages (25 villages in the whole village), among the 77 households, 37 are still deficit households. The situation is roughly the same as above. (4) The so-called average yield is the lowest number, and the highest number is almost unlimited. Some of the floating wealth is still in the hands of the Peasants' Association, and the distributed floating wealth is also not very fair: (1) Cadres and revolutionary soldiers' families get more good houses. (2) The livestock, farm tools, furniture, clothes, etc. obtained by revolutionary soldiers' families are more than those of ordinary people.\n\nIn terms of work style, cadres and activists completely replaced the masses. Almost all the things like detaining targets, confiscating family property, and distributing fruits were done by these hundred or so people. Other masses only watched the excitement at the general meeting, and sometimes raised their fists. Some masses, on the one hand, received the fruits, on the other hand, still pitied the landlords, or did not interfere in politics at all.\n\nRelationship between cadres and the masses: The village cadres' work style is undemocratic. In general, their attitude towards the masses is not good, and they often play tricks. The masses are afraid of them and dare not speak, which has led to the unfair distribution of fruits. Many honest poor peasants and hired laborers have not yet completely turned themselves around and hate the cadres. In the middle-peasant area, because the cadres struggled against many rich peasants to avoid returning the fruits themselves, there is also a fairly common sense of dissatisfaction. In addition, there is a small faction of retired soldiers in the village who often find excuses to provoke dissatisfaction in order to compete with the cadres for power and profit, which has led to the deterioration of the relationship between cadres and the masses. During the summer of 1947, when the cadres were washing their faces and wiping off the blackness, the retired soldiers and the middle peasants used the poor peasants' dissatisfaction to launch an anti-cadre wave. The superiors supported both sides, and began to praise the cadres after the masses raised a few opinions, as a result, the cadres' faces were not washed clean, but instead the masses were attacked, and the cadres took the opportunity to retaliate against the leading elements. At this point, the surface was calm, and no one spoke, but the estrangement was deeper. The masses hated the cadres more than they hated the landlords. In the past, the leaders were deceived by the surface phenomena and felt that there were not many problems in Zhao Village. From the current understanding, there are quite a few problems. A comprehensive understanding is still needed in the subsequent land redistribution movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 赵庄结合整顿队伍  调查全村面貌准备平分  封建势力基本消灭，当前主要问题是干部作风极不民主，果实分配不公。\n\n1948-02-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    赵庄结合整顿队伍\n    调查全村面貌准备平分\n    封建势力基本消灭，当前主要问题是干部作风极不民主，果实分配不公。\n    【本报消息】系统的周密的了解一个村的情况，是一件很不容易的事。过去调查工作上常常依靠干部积极分子，所得材料，形式上看很系统，但实际上常常很多不真实。最近有些干部在武安赵庄村访问贫雇，从漫谈中获得一些材料，还不够全面具体，从认真运用阶级方法了解一个村的情况看，还只是一个尝试；但已发现该村基本的情况，存在着地主基本上虽被打垮，但干部积极分子代替群众，作风极坏，果实分配不公等问题。现将调查的初步结果，报导如下：\n    赵庄是武安九区一个大村，据说工作较好，问题较少。全村有六百八十八户，两千一百零八口人，七千七百余亩土地。抗战前土地相当集中，贫雇数量很大。无地少地的人有三种出路：第一是粉坊工人（本村粉坊甚多），第二是赴东北出卖苦力（担水、下煤窑），第三是在本村或外村当长工。\n    旧统治者有靳家二弟兄（靳高魁、靳高瑞）、是地主兼商店东家，有永茂德、永茂祥两座商号。村人常呼这两座商号的名字代替他两个人的名字。他两人和赵文会、赵全明、李清旺、赵顺兴较小的头子们，借神社和保甲制度来控制全村。此外尚有一个较大的地主名赵顺法，曾有过一千四百亩土地，也有商店开设在阳邑，不过他的土地和商号大部分不在本村，所以对村政权兴趣不高（减租清债时，其产业为各村算去）。\n    一九三七年秋，日寇攻占平汉线，国民党的各路溃兵逃入太行山（均用五十三军之号），旧秩序大乱（只武安一县即同时有十八个杂牌司令），本村亦大受骚扰，村民动产（连地主富农在内）损失甚大。后来日寇与朱怀冰部队时来打搅，直至四一年（消灭了朱怀冰后一年）才开始有我方之公开政权。\n    在我政权未公开前（年代不详），即有我党及武装活动，本村也组织过青抗先、游击小组和党的支部。惟这个支部曾因集体受了地主之贿而被解散（仅保留了一个党员名靳得元，现在军区政治部工作）。解散后重新组织时即抱慎重态度，发展甚慢，开始仅靳满囤（已死）、李宿根（已死）、田东方、杨占魁、赵锡、靳得元等六人，不久又吸收了前被停止党籍者二人（靳才垣、李步贵）共八人。\n    四一年阴历四月初八日，敌来扫荡，全村人逃亡一空，靳家二弟兄和全部旧统治者们组织维持会，张牙舞爪，杀猪请客。党及青抗先、游击小组，受命将他们一伙人一网打尽，送交武西县政府，自此他们的公开政治势力才算基本上垮台，以后虽仍有活动，却不敢公然露面了。\n    四二年减租减息前，因负担问题发动过一次全村自报存粮存款，地主们感到压力渐增，即大量变卖劣地，企图改变成份，无地少地的人取得一部分土地。同年减租清债开始，与地主有租息关系的人又得到一部分土地及粮食，地主阶级在经济上受到大量的削弱。但因地区距敌过近，汉奸势力仍与本村地主勾结，成立帮会及迷信团体三四种，迷惑群众，不久（一年多）亦为我先后破获。\n    当时执行统一战线政策有点偏右，地主仍能借合法掩护自己。靳高瑞（永茂祥）之子靳耀华在县里当高小校长，于减租清债时和群众作公开的说理斗争，群众无可如何。小学教员刘××张干周在本村当小学教员，成立教育会，秘密发展国民党组织，以支持村里地主潜在势力。\n    四三年大灾荒，中农以下多流亡逃散，青壮年多赴东北，死于外或生死不明者甚多，在家饿死者也有。这时政府虽发有救济粮，但村干部不民主，少数人专政，穷而无势者领不上，而合作社（发粮机关）及其有关人员则均可大吃大喝。灾荒过后，一二年之久，逃亡的人才慢慢回来。在渡荒工作中犯了错误的人（靳才垣等）经过处分撤换后（也不彻底），村里工作才好了一点。后来又经过复查，按问题算帐，平分果实，群众又得到了一点补充。\n    从开辟工作起至五四指示以前，本村工作只是光杆子干部与地主作战，打下地主优势后，自己又学了他们的作风来统治其他群众，虽经区级纠正，但纠正得不彻底，几个老党员老干部直到现在变化还不大。\n    五四指示以后，本村作过四、五次斗争（连反特务在内），一次比一次激烈，直到去年秋季的最后一次，才基本上剿灭了封建势力老巢。但干部亲友地主仍未斗透。在新势力方面，党员增至四十七人（现除参军或其他原因减去者外尚余三十九人），积极分子（非干部党员者）也有四五十人，为执行五四指示的队伍（成份是贫雇占绝大多数）。\n    这些人，在历史上久已与地主形成对立，故在没收土地和浮财上是积极的，但在最后一二次，把斗争面扩大，误将富裕中农扩大为斗争对象，这原因现在还没有研究清楚，可能是为了使果实增多，或者是政治上的仇恨。\n    在分配果实方面，原则上是填平补齐，事实上土地作到了填平的形式（每口人平均五石以上的应产粮），不过实质上仍有差别：（一）干部一般的高。农会委员赵恒树一个人有九亩好近地，二十石挂零的产量。（二）抗属一般照顾得过火，多半分的村边好地。赵恒义家六口人，三十七亩半地，一个人十一石多产量，多半是好近地。（三）非干部积极分子与非抗属的贫雇得到的地质量坏，亩数多，虽有同等的应产量，可是误工很大，仍是窟窿。靳廷全一个人九亩地，又远又坏，换人家二亩地还换不到。据三个闾的统计（全村二十五闾），七七户中，有三七户还是窟窿户。与上述情况大体相同。（四）所谓平均产量是最低数，最高数则几乎无限制。浮财有一部分存在农会未动，而已动的浮财分得亦不甚公平：（一）干部和抗属得的好房多。（二）抗属得的牲口、农具、家具、衣服等均比普通群众多。\n    在工作方式上，干部和积极分子完全代替了群众，凡扣押对象、没收家产、分配果实之类的事，几乎全部是这百余个人做，其他群众则仅仅是开大会看看热闹，有时也举一举拳头。有些群众，一方面分得果实，一方面仍可怜地主，或毫不干政。\n    干群关系：村干部作风不民主，一般对群众态度不好，常耍利害。群众对他们害怕，不敢说话，因此也就产生了分配果实的不公。老实贫雇有许多至今没有翻透身，对干部痛恨。中农方面由于干部为避免自己退果实而斗争了不少富裕中农，也存在相当普遍的不满情绪。加以村中有一个荣退军人小宗派，为与干部争权争利，时常找借口挑起不满，故形成干群关系的恶化。四七年夏季干部洗脸擦黑时，荣退军人与中农利用贫农的不满情绪，掀起反干部浪潮。上级两头撑腰，在群众稍稍提了一点意见之后就开始给干部表功，结果干部的脸没有洗成，反而打击了群众，干部乘机对群众报复，打击了为首的分子。至此，表面平静了，谁也不说话，但隔阂更深了。群众仇恨干部超过了仇恨地主。过去领导上迷惑于表面现象，觉得赵庄没甚问题。从现在开始了解的情况看，问题并不少。全面的情况，还需要在以后的平分土地运动中，继续做周密的了解。"

    "content": "[Report by this newspaper] The investigation in Qingyansi Village, Wu'an, revealed that cadres were embezzling and seizing the fruits of labor, and arbitrarily oppressing the people. The masses deeply resented this and urgently demanded emancipation, democracy, and a change in this bad phenomenon. The investigation showed that cadre party members universally over-occupied the fruits of victory. Wang Qingtai, the political director (lower-middle peasant), bought a large mule for 15,000 yuan, a low price, obtained half a string of good houses, embezzled fifty to sixty *jin* of cotton yarn, and 1,700 *jin* of seed cotton. He also bought four *mu* of the best land in the village at a low price. Li Zengsheng, the chairman of the Farmers' Association (middle peasant), bribed the appraisers to exchange for half a string of good houses. Others who received houses were not given the trees, but he was exceptionally given the trees. He also took more bags, clothes, and quilts. He bought a donkey for 170,000 yuan and promised to lend Li Mazi 300,000 yuan to buy relief supplies. The masses reported that he and Wang also had a lot of savings in the cooperative, and they did not know where it came from. Many of the gold and silver jewelry and cash seized during the struggle were never distributed. When distributing the fruits of the harvest, all the good fruits were distributed to the cadres. The accounts for the fruits sold in the spring of the year before last and the autumn of last year were never announced. It was not until February of this year that it was announced that all the money had been deposited into the cooperative on behalf of the masses. The land, houses, trees, livestock, and this summer's fruits seized since the struggle were also sold at a price, but the accounts were not announced. Cadres in the village formed a small anti-people clique, acting arbitrarily and oppressing the masses. Anyone who had raised objections to the cadres was generally retaliated against. This spring, the political director and the chairman of the Farmers' Association incited the beating of Wang Gaoshou, a poor peasant activist, who died from his injuries because he had exposed the village's darkness to the district political commissar. During the \"wiping black and washing faces\" campaign, some of the masses who had raised objections were falsely accused of being spies, some were expelled from the Farmers' Association, and some were warned. The cadres were very unsympathetic to the difficulties of the orphans, widows, and poor hired peasants. Not only did they not distribute any fruit to the old widow Quanlai's wife and the lonely old man, Cai Erpi, they said, \"Anyway, they will die soon, and after they die, the Farmers' Association will have to redistribute it.\"\n\nThe phenomenon of cadres covering up for each other is very serious. Li Dong, the former director of the cooperative, did not settle accounts for thirty-eight months. The masses repeatedly demanded a settlement, but in the end, he only produced 90,000 yuan, which greatly dissatisfied the masses. The masses and militiamen unanimously demanded the dismissal of Wang Tiantang, the militia captain, but in the end, he was not only not dismissed, but those who raised objections were threatened with being labeled counter-revolutionaries. Of the forty-four households of hired, poor, and middle peasants visited during the investigation, twenty-two were currently in the most difficult situation. One household lacked food, housing, and farm tools, three lacked food and housing, one lacked housing, clothing, and bedding, two lacked clothing, bedding, and farm tools, seven lacked food, five lacked housing, and three lacked farm tools. The land of the poor hired lower-middle peasants was fragmented, far away, and of poor quality. The most land-poor was Wang Jicun, whose family of three only had seven or eight *mu* of bad land. Today, these newly emancipated households, in addition to the fact that a few lack a lot in terms of quantity, mainly have problems with the quality of the land. The masses urgently demanded democracy. Even old women like Tao Shanniang, who are usually silent, feel that they have nowhere to express their suffering.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 青烟寺初步调查结果  干部相互包庇多占果实  贫雇只有坏地还没翻身\n\n1948-02-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    青烟寺初步调查结果\n    干部相互包庇多占果实\n    贫雇只有坏地还没翻身\n    【本报消息】武安青烟寺村调查中发现，干部贪污与多占果实，随便欺压人民，群众对此，甚为痛恨，他们迫切要求翻身，要求民主，要求改变这种坏现象。从调查中看：干部党员多占果实是相当普遍的，政治主任王庆泰（下中农）一万五千元贱买一匹大骡子，得了半串好院子，贪污花线有五六十斤，籽花一千七百斤，又贱买本村最好的地四亩。农会主任李增胜（中农）贿赂评议员换得半串好院子，别人分院不分树，他则例外的分了树，布袋、衣服、被子拿的都多。以十七万元买了毛驴一头，并答应借李麻子卅万元买救济物资。群众反映他二人在合作社的存款也很多，不知是从那里来的。斗出的许多金银首饰及现洋等均未见分过，分配果实时，所有好果实都分到干部名下。前年春天和去年秋天卖的果实，从未公布帐目，直至今年二月才宣布全部代群众入合作社。斗争以来的土地、房屋、树、牲口以及今夏的果实，也均作价卖出，帐目也未宣布。干部在本村形成一个反人民的小宗派，独断专行，欺压群众。凡对干部提过意见的，普遍受到打击。今春政治主任、农会主任等策动打贫雇积极分子王高寿，伤重而死，因他曾向区政委揭露本村黑暗。擦黑洗脸时，提过意见的群众有的被诬为特务，有的被开除农会，有的受到警告。干部们对孤寡贫雇的困难是极不体谅的。不但不分给老寡妇全来老婆和孤老汉才二劈果实。且说：“反正快死了，死了后还得给农会再分。”\n    干部内部相互包庇的现象是很严重的，前合作社社长李栋，三十八个月未算帐，群众一再要求清算，最后只拿出九万元完事，群众极为不满。群众和民兵一致要求罢免民兵队长王天堂，最后不仅未罢免，并恐吓提意见的是反革命。在调查中访问过的四十四户雇贫中农中，目前最困难的就有廿二户，缺粮食、房子、农具者有一户，缺粮食、房子的有三户，缺房子、衣被的一户，缺衣被及农具的二户。缺粮者七户，缺房者五户，缺农具者三户。贫雇下中农的土地，又碎、又远、又坏。最缺地的如王继存，三口人才有七、八亩坏地。这些新翻身户，今天对土地的要求，除少数在数量上差得很多的外，主要的还是质量问题。群众迫切要求民主，即便是老婆婆如桃善娘这种素不吭气的人，也感到自己的苦处没处提。"

The entire defending enemy New 5th Army's Provisional 54th Division, the 52nd Army's Transport Regiment, and a traffic police corps, along with the remaining personnel of the New 5th, New 6th, and 52nd Armies, totaling nearly 10,000 men, were annihilated. Numerous enemy officers above the rank of major, including the deputy commander and chief of staff of the Provisional 54th Division, were captured. The New 5th Army, painstakingly formed by the bandit leader Chen Cheng before the winter offensive, was completely wiped out in just one month. The capture of Liaoyang has opened a large gap in the southern defense line of the bandit stronghold of Shenyang. The enemy's isolated strongholds along the southern section of the Chinese Changchun Railway, including Anshan, known as the \"Iron Capital of Manchuria,\" and Yingkou, the so-called supply port, have been left far behind the powerful People's Liberation Army. The seriousness of the blow suffered by the Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast can be seen from the bandit leader Wei Lihuang's panicked \"emergency meeting held late into the night by candlelight\" and the fact that the bandits Chen Cheng and Zheng Dongguo also urgently flew to Nanjing to \"seek help.\"\n\t\n\tSouthern Front: The Hubei-Henan-Anhui People's Liberation Army recovered Qianjiang in central Hubei on the 2nd, and Guangshan in southeastern Henan on the 4th. The Jiangsu-Shandong-Henan-Anhui People's Liberation Army routed a portion of the Kuomintang 545th Brigade, which had advanced from Taikang, west of Taikang on January 29th. From East China to the Northwest, local armed forces and militias in various regions are actively mopping up Kuomintang bandits and local bullies, repeatedly achieving victories. The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu local armed forces recovered Weichuan on January 20th. The local armed forces in western Henan wiped out the bandit stronghold of Stone Monkey Mountain east of Yiyang City on January 23rd, annihilating more than 200 Kuomintang bandits. From January 26th to February 3rd, a week, the areas of Yiyang, Lushi, Nanzhao, and Yunxi collectively annihilated 460 Kuomintang bandits. The majority of the troops of the habitual bandit Ye Laoliu, the joint commander of the enemy's Yiyang, Luoning, and Mianchi counties, who entrenched themselves in Hancheng town west of Yiyang, were annihilated, and the Yiyang Kuomintang puppet county government and eight township offices were also completely wiped out. On January 28th, the 5th Military Sub-district's local armed forces also annihilated more than 150 bandits under the notorious local bandit Huang Wanyi in Linru. At the end of last month, the Central China local armed forces shattered the Kuomintang bandits' desperate \"mopping-up\" operations involving twelve regiments, annihilating more than 6,500 enemies and successively capturing 30 strongholds including Shigang in Nantong, Shizhuang in Rugao, Chahe in Rudong, Gaoji in Lingbi, and Caiwei Lugou in Suqian. On January 17th, a portion of the enemy in Longkou, Jiaodong, ventured out to attack the suburbs of the city but were routed by our besieging troops, with more than 700 enemies annihilated. On the 27th, the Changyi militia captured an enemy motorboat loaded with munitions and more than 100 Kuomintang bandits. On the 17th, a unit of the Central Shandong People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang bandits \"mopping up\" the Yangqiu Mountain area in the triangle region of Tai'an, Laiwu, and Licheng, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 200 bandits; at the same time, militias in Boshan, Zhangqiu, Licheng and other places cooperated with the enemy outside the lines, also annihilating more than 200 bandits. On January 28th, the Taihang local armed forces and militia of the Jinji-Hebei-Lu-Yu region captured Xiaoxinzhuang south of Anyang. Militias on the outskirts of Jiaozuo also took the initiative to attack Kuomintang bandits抢粮 (snatching grain), annihilating more than 200 enemies in the two battles. In mid-January, the cavalry of the Northwest Suiyuan-Mongolia People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 500 troops of the Fu Zuoyi bandit Zhu Qimei, the Mongolian bandit Qi Zhizhong, and others in the Fugu area, liberating vast areas. Recently, guerrillas around Yan'an and Guanzhong have also repeatedly annihilated scattered Kuomintang bandits, recovering much of the grain and livestock that had been looted.

    "content": "Northeast Our Army Intensifies Training\n    Eastern and Northern Manchuria Units Diligently Practice Politics\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th] Several corps of the Northeast Manchuria Military Region participating in the large-scale training movement, having completed the basic training of the four major techniques, have now universally entered the stage of diligently practicing politics. The Political Department of the Heilongjiang Military Region stipulates that cadres should be rectified before soldiers are trained. For veteran cadres, the main focus is on checking their ideology, work style, and life since coming to the Northeast; for new cadres, in addition to checking their ideology and work style, their historical background is also understood, and they are guided to continue to progress. Those alien elements who cannot be educated are resolutely purged. For intellectuals, except for a small number of children from despotic landlords who have blood feuds with workers and peasants and who are themselves very bad, a policy of transformation is generally adopted, and they are given appropriate work. In some units of the Nenjiang Military Region, the enlarged meeting of the regiment party committee was first held, concentrating on the cadres at the regiment and battalion levels, focusing on rectifying the regiment and demonstrating to the battalion. The battalion concentrates the opinions from below to help rectify the regiment. Then, all the company-level cadres of the regiment are absorbed to focus on rectifying the battalion. After the battalion is finished, the enlarged meeting of the battalion party committee is used as a unit to absorb platoon-level cadres, focusing on rectifying the company, while thoroughly following the mass line, freely promoting democracy, and creating a mass movement. When studying the land reform issue, a certain unit of the Hejiang Military Region organized cadres to go to the countryside in rotation to visit the rural land distribution movement and the living conditions of poor peasants, further inspiring love for soldiers and changing their own work style. Some even voluntarily requested to lower their existing living standards. At the same time, the Songjiang Military Region troops also brought into play the creativity of the masses and launched the \"evaluate red and black points\" movement, which further enriched the content of criticism and self-criticism. As a result, some companies have created a situation where soldiers automatically manage themselves, promoting everyone to improve politically and technically.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th] The method of recording \"red and black points\" created by the Third Company of a certain unit of the Songjiang Military Region during the large-scale training movement has been rapidly promoted to various units and has become a mass movement. Initially, the Seventh Squad of this company adopted a scoring method to evaluate training results. Because the soldiers were not used to it, it was changed to drawing red and black circles, with red circles representing advantages and black circles representing disadvantages, which was enthusiastically praised by everyone. Some soldiers also proposed adding blue circles to indicate normalcy. This method was quickly promoted to all squads, creating a movement throughout the company of officers and soldiers striving to earn red points. For this reason, each squad, platoon, and company established a \"no omission record book\" to record the name, reason, time, and place of the person who earned points. The scope of application of the point recording method is very wide. In addition to being used in technology and tactics, it can be used in politics to record ideology, work style, stand, and life. When recording, a democratic discussion method is adopted, and each point must be judged by everyone to convince everyone. For example, the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Squad of the Third Company was given a black point after the soldiers held a meeting to discuss the results of his poor work style. Wang Weiming, the deputy squad leader of the Seventh Squad, took off his clothes and took the lead in throwing grenades on the training ground, and usually got along with the soldiers without losing his temper, so he was given a red point. Comrades who have been criticized at the meeting must conduct self-criticism and express their determination to work hard to correct themselves. Since the launch of this movement, the enthusiasm of the soldiers and the correct democratic work style have been universally established. Many soldiers have been able to overcome some of the difficulties they encountered in training, and some have corrected their biases ideologically and improved their skills at the same time. Some squads and platoons have truly achieved that everyone consciously abides by discipline and soldiers automatically manage themselves. When there is a problem in the unit, everyone will immediately discover it, making the internal more united and consolidated. In the past, it often took a lot of effort for the company's cadres to go to the squads to understand the situation. Now, as long as they go down and look at the red and black points, they can get a general idea. And the soldiers are bolder and more timely in reporting problems to their superiors than in the past.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北我军大练兵  东满北满各部苦练政治\n\n1948-02-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    东北我军大练兵\n    东满北满各部苦练政治\n    【新华社东北十一日电】东北满各军区参与大规模练兵运动的若干兵团，于完成四大技术的基本训练，现已普遍进入苦练政治阶段。黑龙江军区政治部规定先整干部后练战士。对老干部主要是检查其来东北以后的思想作风与生活，对新干部除检查思想作风外，并了解其历史情况，引导其继续进步。对不可教育的异己分子则坚决清洗。对于知识分子，除少数恶霸大地主出身子弟，与工农有杀父之仇，其本人又是很坏的清洗外，一般的均采取改造的方针，并给以适当的工作。嫩江军区有的部队，首由团党委扩大会议，集中团营两级干部，着重整团，对营作示范。营集中下边意见帮助整团。然后再吸收全团连级干部着重整营。营结束后，又以营党委扩大会为单位，吸收排级干部，着重整连，同时并彻底走群众路线，放手发扬民主，造成群众性的运动。合江军区某部在学习土改问题时，曾组织干部轮流下乡，参观农村的平分土地运动与贫苦农民的生活状况，进一步启发了爱兵思想，转变了自己的作风。有的并自动要求降低现有的生活水平。松江军区部队并与此同时发挥了群众的创造性，开展“评红黑点”运动，更加丰富了批评与自我批评的内容。若干连队亦因此造成了战士自动管理自己，推动大家从政治、技术上提高一步。\n    【新华社东北十一日电】松江军区某部三连在大练兵运动中创造的记“红黑点”办法已迅速推广各部，成为群众性的运动。最初该连七班为了评定练兵成绩，采取记分办法。因战士们用不惯，便改为画红黑圈，以红圈表示优点，黑圈表示缺点，得到大家热烈赞许。有的战士还提出加画蓝圈，以表示平常。这一办法就很快推广到各班，造成了整个连队指战员的争取记红点运动。各班排和连亦为此立了“点滴不漏簿”，记载得点人的姓名，事由和时间地点。记点办法运用范围很广，除用在技术和战术上外，在政治上可记思想、作风、立场和生活。记时采取民主讨论方式，每记一点须由大家评判，使各人心服。例如三连四班副班长因作风不好，战士们开会评议结果，给他划了个黑点。七班副班长王维明在操场上脱了衣服带头投弹，平时和战士们打成一片不发脾气，就给划个红点。在会上受了批评的同志须进行自我检讨，表示努力改正决心。自开展这一运动后，战士们的积极性和正确的民主作风普遍树立起来，许多战士在练兵中曾碰到的一些困难，也都能自动克服，有的从思想上纠正偏向后同时又提高了技术。某些班排且真正做到了人人自觉的遵守纪律，战士自动的管理自己。部队中一有问题，也都会立即被大家发觉，使内部更加团结和巩固。过去连里的干部要到班里了解情况，往往需要化很多工夫，现在只要一到下面看看红黑点，就能知道个大概，而战士们向上级反映问题，也比过去大胆和及时了。"

    "content": "Relying on Poor and Hired Peasant Investigation\nTian'erzhuang Cadres Harbor Landlords\nForming Family Rule to Suppress Peasants\nToo Much Difference in Land Fertility\nLarge Grain Deficit for Poor and Hired Peasants\n\n[This newspaper's news] Working personnel in Tian'erzhuang, Wu'an County, have initially learned about the main situation of the village through visits to poor and hired peasants, and have gained experience in visiting them. The following is a brief report on the situation:\n\nTian'erzhuang has 1370.5 mu of land, 100 households, and 342 people (including 33 soldiers and staff working outside), with an average of 4.07 mu of land per person. According to an investigation of 16 poor peasant households, their urgent requirement after the land reform is to adjust some good land. The general quality of their land is very poor. The 16 households have a total of 37 people and 171.5 mu of land, an average of 4.36 mu per person, which is higher than the average; however, the quality is too poor. Of the 171.5 mu, only 50.6 mu are good land, an average of 0.89 mu per person (based on 13 households). Nine out of the 16 households should be supplemented in this way. On the other hand, cadres and those related to cadres have occupied all or most of the good land. For example, the village head was dirt poor before rent reduction, but now has 20.797 mu of good land with no bad land, an average of 4.16 mu per person. The political director is an old middle peasant who exchanged bad land for good land during the land reform. His family of six has 27.34 mu of good land, an average of 4.55 mu per person (according to the poor peasants). These two households have a total of 48.137 mu of good land, almost equal to the total amount of good land of the 16 poor peasant households. The disparity in fertility can be seen. Secondly, the grain problem is very serious. Half of the 16 households will not receive grain until next summer, and six of them are short of more than one dan. This issue must be addressed when dividing the land equally.\n\nThe political characteristic of Tian'erzhuang is the terrifying family rule of the village cadres. Among the 14 cadres including the political director, seven are old middle peasants and seven are new middle peasants. Among them, nine are called \"Director\" (the masses call the political director \"Director\"). The village head - a group of people surnamed Yang and his nephews - has 12 cadres among their 13 party members, who control finance and militia power. In addition, the four brothers and three nephews of the political director, and the two brothers of the village head are their henchmen, standing over the masses. If anyone disagrees with them, they threaten to \"throw them into West Gully\" (meaning to kill them). Last spring (lunar calendar), when the masses demanded the struggle against the landlord Yang Chunfa (who was adopted by the landlord as the brother of the Director), \"the whole gang\" roared on the spot and threatened to throw the poor peasant Yang Xiangzi, who had made the proposal, into the West Gully. The masses were suppressed. This new type of feudal terror rule is still continuing today, but it is also changing. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the cadres sold bricks, tiles, and trees, spread rumors of egalitarianism, and said that grain and property would be equally divided. They ate dumplings lavishly during the solar new year, causing panic among the middle peasants. After we arrived in the village, we repeatedly explained the Land Law, and the poor peasants were happy and came to us. The middle peasants gradually stabilized. The cadres resisted us head-on, monitored us, and sent people to stand guard on our rooftops at night. They sarcastically said to the poor peasants, \"Let's elect you as the chairman of the peasant association!\" On the one hand, we explained the Land Law and exposed the cadres' illegal actions in the winter school and among the poor peasants. On the other hand, we convened cadres and party members, talked about the \"Letter to Party Members,\" and pointed out their way out. At this time, the cadres began to differentiate, and some were willing to accept our education. The worse ones did not dare to openly resist. However, we did not seize the opportunity to educate them, but one-sidedly emphasized applying pressure. As a result, the village head led his family group and organized and planned an attack on the poor peasants. The village head knowingly violated the law and sold 76 sheep. Zhang Tianyi, the most frantic of the \"Director's\" nephews (the nephew of the sheltered landlord Yang Chunfa), deliberately raised ultra-leftist opinions in the winter school, removed the preferential treatment director Yang Eryou from his position, fined the middle peasant Hu Long, and provoked discord between the middle and poor peasants. On December 23rd, in the winter school, the village head and Zhang Tianyi and others struggled against the poor peasant Yang Sheng, who had engaged in hooliganism, interrogated the \"Poor Peasant Corps,\" and attempted to detain Yang Sheng, attempting to crush the Poor Peasant Corps in one fell swoop (they believed that the Poor Peasant Corps had been established and that Yang Sheng was the leader, but in fact, the Poor Peasant Corps had not yet been organized). Three days later, the village head was removed from his position for selling sheep, and most of the cadres lowered their heads, but the \"Director\" was still surrounded by that gang, attempting to maintain their rule and suppress the poor peasants. After the above experience, the poor peasants saw that the district was supporting them, became bolder, more confident, and more united, and their activities became more active.\n\nStand Firm on Position, Gain Trust of Poor and Hired Peasants\n\nIn half a month, we investigated 30 poor and hired peasant households. At first, they were afraid, but later they could talk about the general situation. After figuring out our bottom line - who we were supporting - they gradually told us their innermost thoughts. Recently, many people who have suffered extreme injustice have come to us personally to tell us things they would never tell anyone else. Currently, it appears that nine people are relatively active and steadfast, and six of them have the four major qualifications of a core figure - working year-round, being upright, selfless, and enthusiastic about serving everyone. They are gradually forming a leading core, discussing things in advance, reviewing them later, and proceeding in an orderly manner without confusion. In short, the relationship between the poor and hired peasants and our working personnel in the village in the past half month is a process of mutually probing and investigating, and gradually trusting each other. The poor and hired peasants' investigation and research into us is extremely meticulous and cautious, and they will never easily believe us. Therefore, our every word and deed must be very careful, firmly standing on the side of the poor and hired peasants, and telling them our bottom line through our words and actions, so that they believe us, respond to the party's call - equal distribution and the poor and hired peasants taking charge, and consciously and voluntarily rise up to fight for their own liberation. In other words, the process of probing is the process of enlightening the masses. If this step is done well, there will be a foundation for organizing the Poor Peasant Corps, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences in the next step. Otherwise, they will not follow us. How to probe their bottom line, enlighten their consciousness, and respond to the Land Law Outline? In half a month, we passed two hurdles and reached the point where we trust each other today, and they are consciously acting.\n\nFirst, break the fear of cadre retaliation and establish the idea of the poor and hired peasants taking charge. They said: Who dares to provoke them (referring to the cadres)? They are all one family. If we give them opinions, it will be like that time of \"washing your face and wiping it black\", do you want your life or not? What will happen after you leave? (Unable to figure out the bottom line of the district) Who dares to provoke them? They have roots above. At this time, we lectured on the Land Law Outline, read newspapers, and spoke about the new spirit in the winter school and among the poor peasants, making it clear that this time we were not supporting \"both sides,\" but only supporting the masses. At the same time, we educated them through our actions, living in their homes and eating together. They said, \"Old Li (Kuiting) used to live in the landlord's house for two or three years, and Old Wang came to investigate the work and lived in the cadres' house, but neither of them ever came to our house.\" They are willing to associate with us. We went to the poorest and most oppressed people's homes. The people there said, \"Who has ever come to our house? Who has ever looked up to us?\" They felt immense comfort and honor. Other poor peasants also felt that we were sincerely on the side of the poor. When talking to the cadres, they listened outside and heard us asking the cadres to bow their heads to the masses and criticizing them for occupying too many fruits. They saw that we were indeed only supporting them. The first hurdle of fearing cadre retaliation began to be broken, and they wanted to take charge.\n\nThe second hurdle is that the \"old wood\" (as the poor and hired peasants call themselves) is not good enough, \"We don't know how to speak, can't read, and haven't done anything before,\" \"They (the cadres) are all old cadres, we can't talk them down.\" At this time, we carried out the \"ability\" class education: who to speak for, who to work for, what to say, what is called being able to speak and being able to work. We carried out the four major standards of cadres' education, only \"honest people\" will work for the poor, and encouraged their confidence. In the winter school, we studied the Land Law, discussed issues, and trained them, explaining from their actions that only they speak the truth and know how to speak.\n\nThen, they dared to do it, but felt \"few in number and weak in strength,\" so we carried out the education of uniting the middle peasants, and studied the specific targets and contacted them separately. In this way, after passing the two hurdles, the core figures gradually emerged, and their activities became more and more active.\n\nWhat is the key to getting close to the masses? It lies in whether we actually believe in the masses. We say we believe in the masses in words, but how can we be close to the masses if we don't believe in them or don't fully believe in them? In the past half month, under the correct leadership of the party and the earnest education of the poor and hired peasants, we have broken and are breaking the following ideological obstacles, and gradually the relationship with the masses has become closer.\n\nSincerely Accept the Criticism of the People\n\n1.  We took the narrow viewpoint of the poor and hired peasants as the viewpoint of the masses, only liked the poor and hired peasants, and held deep hatred for the cadres regardless of the size of their mistakes or the degree of their awareness; we were somewhat indifferent to the middle peasants. The poor and hired peasants felt \"weak in strength\" and criticized us for \"not getting angry\" at the cadres, and demanded to unite the middle peasants. They educated us that the interests of the poor and hired peasants are not guaranteed when they do not represent the interests of the majority of people (including the middle peasants).\n\n2.  We replaced the mobilization of the broad masses of poor and hired peasants with the mobilization of active elements. When we saw the poor and hired peasant masses in the middle and backward states with many concerns, not active, and wavering, we expressed indifference and even aversion. We did not understand that the purpose of mobilizing active elements is to mobilize the broad masses in the middle and backward strata. Only when they are conscious and take action can there be a mass movement.\n\n3.  We were fooled by Yang Sheng, who had hooliganistic habits, and treated the hooligan as an active element. In order to get the landlord's daughter-in-law, he actively \"colluded\" with the poor and hired peasants, causing some leakers and \"selfish\" elements to sneak into the poor and hired peasant group, attacked the cadres, broke away from the masses, and took the path of \"leniency first, then strictness\" of Dawan.\n\n4.  We incorrectly treated the shortcomings of the masses. We disliked and even hated the \"rogue\" habits of the poor and hired peasant bachelors getting women, and saying that they were poor in order to get some things when dividing the land equally, and lacked a class-based sympathetic attitude, which affected the work of approaching and transforming them.\n\n5.  Is it okay to use honest poor and hired peasants as the backbone? Is their fighting spirit strong? \"Old wood\" \"cannot make mistakes,\" this is their own answer. The incident of cadres fighting Yang Sheng tested them, and they are the most steadfast and have the strongest fighting spirit.\n\n6.  Don Quixote-style paternalistic work style. We do not know how to mobilize the masses to rise up and do it themselves. Criticizing village cadres and educating hooliganistic elements were all done by ourselves. We often got angry about unfair things, \"The poor are full of tears and sorrows,\" \"I am full of anger,\" which became my catchphrases. We were afraid that the masses would \"fail\" and wanted to \"save\" the situation ourselves. It seemed that everything in Tian'erzhuang depended on ourselves, and we did not know how to rely on the masses, resulting in \"efforts that do not pay off.\" The cadres resisted greatly, the poor and hired peasants were isolated, and we ourselves were worried about being shot in the back. The cadres and landlords combined and, by attacking the hooligan Yang Sheng, launched a massive counterattack against the poor and hired peasants, causing great damage to the morale of the poor and hired peasants. From this, we learned that we are insignificant and incapable, and only by mobilizing the masses to consciously and voluntarily rise up, criticize the cadres, educate hooliganistic elements, and get angry at unfair things—only then will there be strength, cadres will bow their heads, hooligans will be transformed, unfair things will be eliminated, and the masses will truly stand up and truly be in charge.\n\nThe above are the problems encountered in the past half month. Without solving these problems, without this minimum mass concept - the concept of believing in the masses - simply talking about methods and ways to get close to the masses is impossible to get close to the masses and may even lead to detachment from the masses. Conversely, believing in the masses by one point will bring us closer to the masses by one point, and there will be one more way to do things.

    "content": "Northern University Holds University-Wide Meeting\n    to Purge Zhai Shixian's Landlord Thoughts and Actions\n    Zhai Remains Obstinate and Has Been Expelled from the Party and Removed from His Positions\n    [Our Newspaper's News] On February 1st, the Northern University Student Committee General Assembly held a meeting in the school auditorium to conduct a serious ideological struggle against Zhai Moxinxin (Shixian), a class alien element who had infiltrated the Party. Except for the Art Institute, which was too far from the school headquarters to participate, comrades from the school headquarters and the various colleges of Liberal Arts and Education, Finance and Economics, Industry, Agriculture, and Medicine all participated, totaling more than 1,000 people.\n    The meeting began at 10:00 AM, with Fan Wenlan, Zeng Yi, Zhang Zonglin, Le Tianyu, Chen Weishi, Xi Dongguang, Qin Siping, Liu Lie夫, and students Luo Juda (Engineering College), Wang Kongwen (Agricultural College), Li Longpan (Finance and Economics College), Li Xuecheng (Medical College), and Xu Jingwu (Liberal Arts and Education College), forming the presidium, chaired by Comrades Chen Weishi and Liu Lie夫. Comrade Chen Weishi reported on the significance of the meeting, saying, \"Zhai Moxinxin is the worst typical bad Party member and bad cadre in the Northern University Party, so we are holding this meeting to educate him and let everyone criticize his bad thoughts, which is also self-education for everyone.\" Dean Zhang introduced Zhai's criminal history and his dishonest learning in the group. The chairman asked Zhai Moxinxin to sincerely confess to the masses, but he did not confess his crimes. He just put his hands in his pockets, swayed back and forth, and talked like he was lecturing, revealing an extremely contemptuous fake smile, putting a few empty hats on himself, and currying favor with his maid Wu Yan, saying, \"I'm sorry to you,\" and that was it. Wu Yan's name in Zhai's house was Juhua; she was sold to Zhai's family for a silver dollar when she was five years old. Zhai was afraid that she would expose the inside story of the family, so he forcibly tied her to a cart and dragged her out the year before last. She complained about her suffering, recounting the miserable scene of kneeling on the stove bars and in the snow all day without being allowed to get up. She sobbed uncontrollably, and many people were moved to tears. Then, the comrades criticized him and educated him, showing a high degree of righteous indignation. Some comrades revealed that Zhai had been a puppet soldier in 1938 and pointed out that he had never awakened. Some comrades were so angry that they could hardly speak: \"You have consistently opposed the leadership, sowed discord... In Taiyue, you opposed Wang Xinting...\" and further exposed Zhai's four trips home, sabotaging land reform, stealing the fruits of the struggle, threatening and scolding village cadres, and releasing ten targets of struggle, insulting the revolutionary mass movement.... More and more people were submitting notes requesting to speak, and the masses' hatred was clearly rising. It was not until the presidium announced, \"We will discuss punishment tonight,\" that everyone calmed down.\n    When the meeting continued with gas lamps lit, the masses were even more energetic. The comrades' speeches were often interrupted by angry slogans. When analyzing Zhai's thoughts and actions, the masses shouted, \"Zhai Moxinxin is not a Communist Party member, but a Kuomintang member!\" When it was mentioned that Zhai should repay his blood debt for sabotaging land reform, the masses shouted, \"Oppose the landlord element Zhai Moxinxin who refuses to surrender his gun, and tell him to get out!\" Someone analyzed the legal aspects of Zhai's crimes according to the Outline Land Law and the decrees promulgated by the Border Government and suggested that he be handed over to the People's Court for handling, and the masses unanimously shouted, \"We agree!\" Zhai Moxinxin's ugly face was nakedly exposed. He was no longer as arrogant and domineering as he had been at the beginning of the meeting, putting on the airs of a landlord. Sixty-four people had already spoken, and one hundred and four more were waiting to speak, and many more were continuing to submit notes. In order to give more people the opportunity to speak, the presidium announced free speech, with a maximum of three minutes per person. Often, before one person finished speaking, the sound of slogans would erupt at the same time.\n    A burst of angry slogans shouted, \"Zhai Moxinxin is a sinner of the people! A black spot on the Party!\" The masses' hatred had risen to an uncontrollable level, and the angry applause was deafening. It was not until the chairman announced that he would invite the Dean of Academic Affairs to make a concluding speech that the meeting place became quiet again. Comrade Zeng Yi analyzed and criticized the landlord element Zhai Moxinxin in a firm voice. Principal Fan Wenlan appeared on the podium amidst warm and welcoming applause. He cordially encouraged everyone and finally solemnly put forward two points: First, check whether there are still class alien elements in the Northern University who insist on their original positions; second, the landlord and rich peasant thoughts in our minds must be eliminated. The chairman led everyone in shouting slogans such as \"Strive for the victory of the three investigations and learning in the Northern University!\" Everyone dispersed from the meeting with the firm confidence of resolutely cleansing the landlord and rich peasant thoughts in their minds. Everyone cheered for a while, and it was already nearly midnight.\n    Furthermore, the Northern University General Branch Committee and the Student Committee General Assembly, after careful consideration, have decided on the punishment for Zhai Moxinxin. Because Zhai insisted on his landlord class position and refused to change after repeated education, it was decided to expel him from the Party, remove him from his position as acting director and teacher of the fifth class of the Liberal Arts and Education College, and send him back to his hometown by militiamen for review and punishment by the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北方大学召开全校大会  清算翟士贤地主思想行为  翟仍执迷不悟已被开除党籍撤销职务\n\n1948-02-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    北方大学召开全校大会\n    清算翟士贤地主思想行为\n    翟仍执迷不悟已被开除党籍撤销职务\n    【本报消息】二月一日，北大学委总会为着对混进党内的阶级异己分子翟墨新（士贤）进行严肃的思想斗争，在校部礼堂召开了一个大会。除艺术学院因离校部较远未能参加外，校部及文教、财经、工、农、医各学院的同志们都参加了，共一千多人。\n    上午十时大会开始，由学委总会提出的范文澜、曾毅、张宗麟、乐天宇、陈唯实、习东光、秦思平、刘列夫及同学罗巨达（工学院）、王孔文（农学院）、李龙蟠（财经学院）、李学成（医学院）、徐静吾（文教学院）等十三位同志组成主席团，由陈唯实、刘列夫二同志主持会议。陈唯实同志报告开会意义说：“翟墨新是北大党内最坏的一个典型坏党员、坏干部，因此开大会教育他，让大家批判他的坏思想，同时也是大家的自我教育。”张院长介绍了翟的罪恶历史和他在小组上不老实的学习情况。主席叫翟墨新向群众诚恳坦白，但他并不坦白自己的罪恶，只两手向裤兜一插，摆来摆去，好象讲书一样，露着极端轻蔑的假笑给自己戴了几个空帽子，拉拢一下他的丫头武炎说：“我对不起你，”就算完了。武炎在翟家的名字叫做菊花，是五岁上一块现洋卖到翟家的。翟怕她暴露家中的内货，在前年硬把她缚在车上拉出来了。她诉苦，说到跪在炉条上，跪在雪地上一天不叫起来的凄惨情景，她泣不成声了，有不少人激动的流了泪。接着，大家同志批评他教育他，表现了高度的义愤。有的同志揭穿翟在三八年当过伪军。并指出他一直不觉悟。有些同志气得几乎话也说不好了：“你一贯的反领导，挑拨离间……在太岳，你反对王新亭………。”并进一步揭露翟四次回家，破坏土改，窃取斗争果实，威胁辱骂村干，还放走十个斗争对象，侮辱革命的群运……。递条子要求发言的人越来越多，群众的仇恨情绪显然是越来越高了。直到主席团宣布：“晚上再谈处分。”大家才平息下来。\n    点着汽灯继续开会时，群众的精神更旺盛了。同志们的发言往往被愤怒的口号所打断。当分析到翟的思想行为时，群众就高呼：“翟墨新不是共产党员，是国民党员！”说到翟应当偿还破坏土改的血债，群众就高呼：“反对不缴枪的地主分子翟墨新，叫他滚出去！”有人根据土地法大纲及边府公布的法令分析翟所犯罪行的法律部分应交人民法庭处理，群众就一致高呼：“赞成！”翟墨新的罪恶面貌赤裸裸的摆出来了，他再不象刚开会那样的盛气凌人，摆地主的臭架子了。已经有六十四人发过言，还有一百零四人在等着发言，还有好多人在继续递条子。为着使更多的人有发言机会，主席团宣布了自由发言，一个人至多三分钟。往往一个人的话还没完，喊口号的声音就同时发作。\n    一阵愤怒的口号喊着：“翟墨新是人民的罪人！党的黑点！”群众的仇恨已经高涨到不可抑制，愤怒的掌声剧烈的响着。直到主席宣布请教务长作总结性的发言，会场才又安静下来。曾毅同志用坚实的声音把地主分子翟墨新分析批判了，校长范文澜老在热烈的欢迎掌声中出现主席台上，他亲切地鼓舞了大家，最后严肃的提出两点：第一，查北大还有没有坚持原立场的阶级异己分子存在；第二，脑子的地富思想要去掉。主席领导大家呼“为北大三查学习的胜利而奋斗”等口号，大家抱着坚决清洗脑子里地富思想的信心散会了。大家欢呼了一阵，时已近夜半十二点钟。\n    又讯：北大总支委会和学委总会经过慎重考虑，已决定了对翟墨新的处分。因为翟坚持他的地主阶级立场，经多次教育仍执迷不改，决予开除党籍，撤销他文教院第五班代理主任兼教员的职务，并交民兵带回原籍由群众审查、处分。"

    "content": "Comrade Zhang Zonglin, representing the first cadre group of the Peking University College of Arts and Education, reported on Zhai Moxin's materials and his attitude towards learning in this land reform study:\n\nZhai Moxin, originally named Zhai Shixian, is from Boyan Town, Wu'an. He is thirty-four years old this year, works at the College of Arts and Education, and is a Communist Party member. His father, Zhai Hongwen, was a \"big figure\" in Boyan, a landlord and bully who often arrested tenant farmers and sent them to officials. His family owned more than 500 mu of land, of which about 300 mu were purchased outright, and about 200 mu were mortgaged. He had about 200 rooms, occupying one-half of the entire village, as well as a garden, and several shops in Kaifeng and other places.\n\nZhai's mother was an extremely vicious woman who abused maids, poking them with cigarette sticks, burning them with red-hot irons, and starving them. Zhai Moxin and his four younger sisters helped beat them. According to Zhai himself, they killed two people and crippled another.\n\nIn addition to collecting rent, the Zhai family also hired laborers to farm the land, treating them even more harshly. The best worker could not earn more than forty yuan a year, and wages were only paid at the end of the year. Even if a worker's parents became ill or died, they could not borrow a penny. A dozen or so workers lived in a small room, living with the livestock. Once, a worker fell asleep with his mouth open, and he actually urinated into the worker's mouth.\n\nZhai Moxin relied on exploiting the blood and sweat of the peasants to live an extremely luxurious life. He lived in a large house with elaborate furnishings, constantly filled with fragrance, either floral or perfume. He ate white flour, rice, fish, and meat. The number of his clothes was even harder to count. His first wife's dowry alone included fifty or sixty quilts and two or three hundred pieces of fur and silk clothing. The family kept six or seven good livestock, and had a car and a mule-drawn carriage. They also kept many fierce dogs to guard the house at night, and ordinary poor people did not dare to enter his home. Zhai Moxin grew up in this family.\n\nHe stood on the side of the landlord to sabotage land reform: At the beginning of the rent and interest reduction policy, he wrote to the local working comrades, asking them to take care of his family.\n\nHe returned home four times during the land reform:\n\nThe first time, he rode home on horseback and held a grand banquet. As soon as he got home, he demanded 5,000 yuan in debt from his father. He wrote to the Central Bureau, saying: \"Why should we distribute floating wealth?\" He told the landlords: \"The cadres have not been trained well yet. Once they are trained, there will be no floating wealth.\"\n\nThe second and third times, he rode back home ostentatiously, and interceded for a large landlord named Fang (his uncle) who was detained by the Public Security Bureau, even asking Fang to teach at Peking University, but this did not materialize. He also sold seventeen mu of good land, and built an air-raid shelter for his sister, hiding mules, gold rings, blankets, etc.\n\nThe fourth time, when he returned home, he was very angry to see that his family had been struggled against, and asked the district political commissar what was going on. He then began to settle accounts in reverse, insulting village cadre Lao Niu as a special agent. The county committee supported the masses, but he saw that the situation was not good, so he talked about the domestic and international situation, and sowed discord between the cadres and the masses, telling Lao Niu: \"The masses want to struggle against you, but I refused.\" He also sold eighteen mu of good land, leaving three good houses, saying that his father would live there when he returned. He brought out a lot of personal belongings, and even brought out a little girl named Juhua, telling her that he was bringing her out to go to school, but in reality, she is now taking care of his children. According to Zhai, he brought her out because he was afraid that Juhua would marry someone and struggle against him, and because Juhua knew some places where his family's hidden valuables were stored.\n\nHe brought out some floating wealth from his home, such as gold rings... He also thought of going to his father-in-law's house to dig for gold. He sold the bribe mule and asked someone to sell the pistol butt to Shimen (later confiscated by the military region). He used public livestock for private production. He spent tens of thousands of yuan enjoying himself at Peking University for two years.\n\nDuring the land reform, he released ten landlords one after another, some to Shimen, some to Kaifeng. Last year, when the People's Daily first exposed the truth about Zhai Shixian's \"land donation,\" he was furious and told his classmates that the newspaper was full of nonsense. When someone asked him to reflect, he said: \"Why not take care of my family?\" At the cadre study group meeting, he emphasized that his father was an enlightened person who could be educated, saying that he was a Marxist-Leninist. He also said: \"The crimes I have committed, if I were in the army, I wouldn't be afraid of anything, at most a warning. But in school, the old man's (referring to the president) hurdle is difficult to pass.\" He also said: \"If I am expelled from the Party, I will definitely appeal.\" After the May 4th Directive, he told a newly arrived teacher: \"Now it is even more severe than physically eliminating landlords during the civil war!\"\n\nHe had four kinds of statements about land reform: (1) Regarding the landlords who were struggled against and opposed the working people, he said: \"The cadres have not been trained well yet.\" Meaning he sympathized with the landlords and felt that the cadres had struggled against them incorrectly. (2) To the masses, it was intimidation. For example, he told the villagers: \"The Central Government stipulates that my family should be taken care of.\" (3) To foreign intellectuals, he said: The May 4th Directive is even more severe than physically eliminating landlords during the civil war. (4) To Party members, such as those he knew relatively well, he would say in words: \"We have to struggle like this.\" To those he knew vaguely, he said: \"The Party's policies are excessive.\" In this land reform study, he looked down on anyone in the group. When making a self-reflection report, he boasted about the wealth of his home and flaunted his \"revolutionary\" history. At first, he did not answer the questions at all. Later, he added many contradictory labels. For example, he said: \"I am a traitor to the landlord class.\" He also said he was a \"landlord element.\" But he did not reveal his true colors, was not loyal, and was not honest. Later, the group was expanded, and everyone helped him study for a total of four days, but he was still not honest. Therefore, the Study Committee General Assembly decided to hold a general meeting to educate him.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地主分子翟士贤\n\n1948-02-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    地主分子翟士贤\n    张宗麟同志代表北大文教学院干部第一小组报告翟墨新在这次土改学习中的材料和他的学习态度：\n    翟墨新原名翟士贤，武安伯延镇人，今年三十四岁，现在文教院工作，共产党员。父亲翟鸿文，是伯延的“人物头”，是个地主恶霸，常把佃户抓起送官送府。他家有地五百多亩，其中有三百亩是死契，约二百亩是典押的。房子约二百多间，占有全村二分之一，还有花园一座，在开封等地还有好几个店铺。\n    翟的母亲是一个极凶恶的妇人，她虐待使女，用烟签戳、用红烙铁烫、饿肚子，翟墨新和他四个妹妹帮助打。据翟自己说共弄死两条人命，还有一个被弄成残废。\n    翟家除收租外，家里也雇工种地，对雇工更苛刻，一个最好的工人，一年工资不得多于四十元，而且到年底才给工资。平时虽然工人的父母生病死亡也不得借支一文。十几个雇工住在一间小屋里，与牲口同住，有一次雇工张着口熟睡，他竟尿到雇工口中。\n    翟墨新靠着剥削农民的血汗奢侈之极，住大房子，陈设讲究，常年都是香的，不是花香即是香水香。吃的是白面、大米、鱼肉。衣服之多更难统计，他的前妻嫁妆光是被子就有五六十条，皮衣绸衣二三百件。家里喂了六七个好牲口，有轿车、驼骡轿。还喂了许多恶犬看门守夜，平时贫苦老百姓不敢进他家。翟墨新就是在这个家庭长大的。\n    他站在地主立场来破坏土改：在开始减租减息政策的时候，他就写信给当地的工作同志，叫照顾他的家庭。\n    在土改中他曾四次回家：\n    第一次，骑马回家，大摆筵席，一回家就给父亲讨债五千元。给中央局写信说：“为啥要分浮财？”对地主说：“干部还没训练好，训好就不要浮财了。”\n    第二、三次都是骑着马耀武扬威回去的，并给一个公安局扣押的大地主方某（为其舅父）说情，还叫方某来北大教书，但未成事实。他又卖好地十七亩，又替妹子作防空洞，藏骡子、金戒指、毛毯等。\n    第四次，回家一看，家被斗了，非常生气，问区政委这是怎样搞的。他于是进行倒算，辱骂村干部老牛是特务，县委给群众撑腰，他则看风声不对，就谈起国内外形势，并挑拨干部和群众的关系，对老牛说：“群众要斗争你，我拒绝了。”又卖好地十八亩，留下三座好房子，说给父亲回来住。带出来很多内货，还将一个小丫头菊花带出来，并对他说是给她上学的，实则现在给他抱孩子。而带她出来的动机，据翟说是怕菊花嫁了人斗争他，而且菊花知道一些他家的内货贮藏的地方。\n    从家里带出一些浮财如金戒指…………，还想到老丈人家去挖金子，他把受贿的骡子卖了，把手枪托人卖到石门（后被军区没收），把公家牲口拿了作私人生产，他在北大两年享乐共用了十几万元。\n    在土改期间他先后放走十个地主，有的到石门，有的到开封。去年人民日报第一次揭露翟士贤“献田”真象时，他大怒，并和同学说报上是客里空。有人叫他反省，他说：“为什么不照顾家？”在干部学习小组会上，强调他父亲是开明人士，可以教育，说是马列主义者。又说：“我犯的罪过，倘若在部队里，不怕什么，至多是警告。但在学校，老头子（指校长）的关难过。”还说：“如开除我党籍，我非上诉不可。”在五四指示之后，他对一个新来的教员说：“现在比内战时肉体消灭地主还利害！”\n    他对土改有四种说法：（一）对被斗的反对劳动人民的地主，他说：“干部还没有训练好。”意思是同情地主，觉得干部斗错了。（二）对群众是吓唬。如他对老乡说：“中央规定照顾我家。”（三）对外来知识分子说：五四指示比内战时肉体消灭地主还利害。（四）对党员，如认识比较好的，他就口头上说：“非这样斗不行”。对认识模糊的，他说：“党的政策过火了。”在这次土改学习中，他看不起小组中的任何人，作反省报告时夸耀了一套家中阔气，炫耀他“革命”的历史，最初根本不回答问题，后来加上许多矛盾的帽子。如说：“我是地主阶级的叛徒。”又说是“地主分子。”但不露出真面目，不忠诚，不老实。后将小组扩大，大家帮助他学习，先后共四天，但仍不老实，于是，学委总会就决定开大会来教育他。"

    "content": "A Discussion on the Establishment of a \"Poor Peasant Association\" at Peking University Medical College\n    To the Editor:\n    After reading the first issue of the Peking University journal \"Northern Communications\" after its revision, I am very happy. This highest institution of learning in the border region has, in accordance with the spirit of the Land Conference of the entire region, launched a struggle to draw clear class lines and eliminate landlord ideology. This movement, as Principal Fan said, is to \"fight for the purification of the Party at Peking University! Fight for the purification of the ranks of the masses! Fight for the purification of the thoughts of every comrade!\"\n    From some individual news and phrases, I also deeply feel that some viewpoints and practices need further mutual discussion:\n    On January 9th, Peking University Medical College gathered eighty children of hired and poor peasants from the entire college to hold a forum and established a unified Poor Peasant Association, which is responsible for the class education of more than 500 people in the college. This method is worth considering. I believe that Peking University is a place led by the Party to educate, cultivate, and transform intellectual youth. The educational line of Peking University is also the one prescribed by Chairman Mao: the proletarian-led mass anti-imperialist and anti-feudal class line. Therefore, the educational purpose is to transform thinking, draw clear lines, strengthen class education, and overcome landlord and rich peasant ideology, and not something else. The establishment of the Poor Peasant Association at least objectively means mechanically transplanting the organizational form of class struggle in the countryside to the school. What will the Poor Peasant Association do? To struggle against landlords? However, the teachers and students in the school are mostly of landlord origin, and they have not participated in direct exploitation. Their thinking can be transformed, so they should not be treated as ordinary landlords. The relationship between teachers and students and between classmates in the school is equal, without political oppression or economic exploitation. Thus, if the Poor Peasant Association is established to deal with landlords, it is completely unfounded. Or, say: the establishment of the Poor Peasant Association is to undertake the task of class education. I think this ideological leadership task should be undertaken by the Party and the Student Committee of Peking University. It is permissible to absorb some good students from poor peasant backgrounds to participate in the leadership. In the study, it is perfectly right for students from poor peasant backgrounds to raise their class consciousness with their own personal experiences, but all this does not require the organization of a Poor Peasant Association. On the contrary, the establishment of the Poor Peasant Association hinders the possibility of close unity between students from poor peasant backgrounds and other broad students to jointly transform their thinking.\n    Reader Ruo Ning\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 对北大医学院成立“贫农会”的商榷\n若宁\n1948-02-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    对北大医学院成立“贫农会”的商榷\n    编辑同志：\n    读了北大校刊“北方通讯”改版第一号，我很高兴，这一边区最高学府已经按照全区土地会议精神开展了划清阶级界线，清除地主思想的斗争，这一运动，正如范校长所说的：是要“为北大党的纯洁化而战斗！为群众队伍的纯洁化而战斗！为每个同志的思想的纯洁化而战斗！”\n    从某些个别消息和字句中，我也深深觉得有些观点和做法有进一步互相商榷之必要：\n    一月九日北大医学院集合全院八十个雇贫子弟召开座谈会，成立了统一的贫农会，担任全院五百多人的阶级教育的任务，这个办法是值得考虑的，我觉得北大是党领导的教育培养改造知识青年的场所，北大的教育路线也就是毛主席所规定的。无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的阶级路线，因此在教育目的上是改造思想、划清界限、加强阶级教育，克服地主富农思想，而不是其他；成立贫农会至少在客观上意味着把农村阶级斗争中的组织形式机械的搬运到学校中去。贫农会将要做些什么呢？为了对地主做斗争？可是学校里教员学生绝大部分只是地主成份，没有参加过直接剥削，他们的思想是能够改造的，因而不应该把他们当做一般的地主来看待，学校里师生间与同学间是平等的，没有政治上压迫与经济上剥削关系；这样，如果是为了对付地主而来成立贫农会，是完全没有根据的。或者说：成立贫农会是为了担负阶级教育任务，我觉得这一思想领导任务应由北大的党和学委会来担任，吸收某些出身贫雇的好同学参加领导是可以的，在学习中贫雇出身同学以自己的亲历身受提高阶级觉悟是完全应该的，但这一切并不需要组织贫农会，相反的，成立贫农会则是妨害贫雇农出身同学同其他广大同学亲密团结共同改造思想的可能。读者  若宁"

Those who cannot write can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write. Or come to the newspaper office yourself. If that doesn't work, write a letter to the newspaper, give us a heads up, and we can figure out a way.\n\nDear Editors:\n\n    I am from Lin County, Henan. My name is Fu Xiaoyuan. At home, I was so exploited and oppressed by the landlords that I couldn't survive. In the year the Japanese attacked Changzhi, my family of eight begged for food to Dong Chongxian Village in Huguan County, Shanxi. After saying thousands of good words, we rented seven dilapidated houses from the landlord Ping Fugui, paying a rent of one stone and three dou of rice per year. That was the official price. During the New Year and festivals, we had to buy several catties of meat and several catties of wine as gifts. During the busy farming season, we had to give several days of labor as extra thanks. After finding the houses, my family still didn't have a single piece of land. My father had to open a small shop, the women spun and wove, and I carried small loads and cultivated wasteland to make a living. We slowly cultivated the wasteland to five mu.\n\n    In recent years, the Communist Party has called on us to rise up, organize ourselves, and fight against the landlords. But because the main cadres in the village were landlords and hooligans, they tightly protected the landlords, causing our movements to fail every time. The stone slab was not lifted, but instead pressed down even harder. Wang Taishun's father was the village chief in the old society, and Wang Taishun is now the political director in the new society. A nod of his head, a word from his mouth, and the earth shakes. Cheng Shenfu is the deputy village chief. In the past, consuming opium, gambling, and whoring were his daily routine. Jiang Chengshui was a triple-faced village chief when the enemy and the stubborn were around, and later he became our labor support. These people hold great power, and which of the masses is not afraid of them with a word? These people don't do any work, they gamble and whore all day long. It's impossible to talk about them leading us to liberation. And every movement, they suppress us.\n\n    In 1942, when we rose up to fight for liberation, they suppressed us poor people, making it so we didn't dare to say much, let alone reduce rent. In 1944, movements started again in various places. The cadres didn't lead us to do anything, and we didn't dare to struggle. Luckily, Political Commissar Li and Comrade Zhao from the district came to work. They told us that as long as we worked together, we could completely liberate ourselves even if the cadres didn't lead us. The district office stood up for us, and the poor people became bolder. At this time, the landlord Ping Fugui threatened us, saying that his brother was a Communist and making an eight-finger gesture, telling us not to struggle. We were not afraid and became even more determined. Bi Kuize, Zhang Chouze, Guo Donggui, and others, who had no food to eat, used their own suffering to mobilize our poor friends to fight against the landlords. Just then, Political Commissar Li left for a meeting. The landlords and cadres seized the opportunity to counterattack us. That night, there were especially many people in the winter school. The landlord's family, big and small, all came, standing very tall, their faces full of smiles. We saw that the situation was not right and passed the word to the poor people to completely move to another place to discuss. Who knew that the cadres had already posted four or five militiamen at the door, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, and none of us could get out. What to do? We passed the word a second time, telling everyone not to express any opinions tonight, to observe the situation and act accordingly, assuming they couldn't eliminate all of us dozens of poor people. We huddled together, not saying a word, staring with our eyes. The political director and other cadres started talking. The first thing they said was that we wanted to fight against the Shanxi people, and that the local people should unite to deal with us. The second thing they did was label us as spies, saying that we were holding a spy meeting. They had the landlord's son, who was in the militia, tie up me and Zhang Chouze. The Communist Party called on us to fight for liberation, and district cadres personally led us, but now we had become spies. Everyone couldn't help but want to fight them, but they thought that we were unarmed, and they had power and guns, so we could only endure it. As long as Political Commissar Li came tomorrow, we would have a solution. Me and Zhang Chouze were detained in the freezing Guanyin Temple and were even force-fed feces. Fortunately, the person who went to the district to send a message was fast, and Political Commissar Li sent a letter, which prevented them from hanging us up. The next day at dawn, Political Commissar Li and Comrade Zhao rushed over. We asked Comrade Zhao if he would stand up for us to the end. Comrade Zhao replied that he was going to another village and told us not to lose heart, that one day we would completely liberate ourselves. Political Commissar Li was still here. Things got worse afterward, and the power to lead the movement was handed back to the cadres. We became the target of struggle again. Guo Chegui, who had no land to cultivate and no food to eat, earned a few dou of rice by playing the drum, the lowest occupation in the old society, was accused of feudal exploitation, received a beating, and his rice and drum were taken away. Zhang Chouze was a tenant farmer and was beaten three times in three days. One beating a day was unbearable, so Zhang Chouze and I discussed that there was only one way out: to find our old roots and join the People's Liberation Army. Zhang Chouze left his mother, who had no food to eat, and joined the army. The poor people's liberation movement was crushed by these bullies and landlords. The bullies ate openly. Wang Taishun was promoted from political director to administrator in the public security bureau, and Jiang Chengshui was promoted from labor support to village chief.\n\n    In the winter of 1945, the landlords were afraid that we would fight again, so they talked with the district chief at the district office and asked me to move out of the village and vacate the seven houses I was renting. District Chief Song Shihong (female) gave a verdict in accordance with the landlord's wishes. I was not convinced and went to the county to find Deputy County Chief Zhou, who wrote a letter allowing me to move after the New Year. The letter angered District Chief Song, who glared and said: Even if you find the county chief, you still have to move the houses. If you don't move, I'll detain you. And so I stayed in the detention center. Later, I don't know how, Political Commissar Li released me and told me: Don't be angry, vacate them. Then it was handled by Secretary Feng. The landlord's family said that I had broken an old jar that they had, so I had to pay for a new one. I also made up three dou of rent owed. The annual rent of one stone and three dou of rice was paid in full, without missing a single grain. My whole family of eight left Dong Chongxian on the fifteenth day of the twelfth month. As we were leaving, the landlord Ping Fugui and Village Chief Jiang Chengshui said that the sweet potatoes I had planted on the five mu of wasteland: the land belonged to their village, and the things also belonged to their village, and they wouldn't let me take them. I only took them after asking Deputy County Chief Zhou. My whole family left and stayed in Zejing Village, five li away from Dong Chongxian. The landlord Ping Fugui went to Zejing to sabotage, saying that I was a spy in his village and that they shouldn't keep me. The militia committee director of Zejing was a poor man, and he knew our difficulties, so he spoke a few harsh words and drove him away, and I was able to stay in Zejing.\n\n    Now that the Land Law Outline has been promulgated, I want to speak out. These landlords and bad cadres must now be truly dealt with.\n\n    (My official name is Fu Yingui, my nickname is Fu Xiaoyuan, and I live in Zejing Village, Huguan. I can't write myself, so I found a comrade, I said it, he wrote it for me, and he read it to me, and I heard that it was all correct. If there is any error, I am willing to have a face-to-face dialogue with these people.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 我们起来闹翻身被坏干部打垮了\n傅小元\n1948-02-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    我们起来闹翻身被坏干部打垮了\n    傅小元\n    农民们：\n    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控诉地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。\n    大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写。要不就自己来报馆跑一趟。再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。编辑同志：\n    我是河南林县人，我叫傅小元，在家被地主剥削、压制的没法立足，在日本进攻长治的那一年，全家八口人讨饭讨到山西壶关县东崇贤村。说了千万句好话，租了地主平富贵七间破房子，每年租米一石三，这是正价。在过年过节得买几斤肉打几斤酒送送礼，农忙时送几个工，这是额外报谢。房子找下了，全家仍没一分地，只好由父亲开一个小店，妇女纺织，我担小挑捎带开坡地糊口，坡地慢慢开到五亩。\n    几年来共产党号召我们翻身，组织起来和地主斗争，但因为村里的主要干部是地主、流氓当任，紧紧的保护着地主，使我们每次运动都是失败，石板没有揭掉，反而压的更重了。王太顺的父亲在旧社会当村长，王太顺在新社会当政治主任，点点头、说句话，地动山摇。程申福当副村长，他在从前吸料面、大烟，赌钱，嫖女人是他的家常便饭。蒋成水在敌顽在时是三面村长，以后也当成我们的抗勤。这些人掌握着大权，说一句哪个群众不害怕？这些人不做工作，成天赌博、嫖女人，根本说不上领导我们翻身，并且每次运动，都让他们把我们镇压下去。\n    四二年我们起来闹翻身，他们把我们穷人压下去，弄的我们别说减租，连话也不敢多说。四四年各地运动又开始了，干部不领导我们干，我们想斗争又不敢。可巧区上李政委和赵同志来工作，他便告诉我们，只要我们齐心干，干部不领导也能翻透身。区公所给我们做主，穷人们就都胆大了。这时候地主平富贵威吓我们，说他兄弟是共产党，用手又比了个八字，不叫我们斗争。我们没有害怕，还更坚决了。没饭吃的毕魁则、张丑则、郭东贵等以苦引苦，动员我们穷朋友，要向地主作斗争。正在这时候，李政委开会走了。地主和干部就乘机向我们反攻。这一夜冬学里人特别多，地主家的大大小小全都来到，站的很高，满脸发笑。我们看见情形不对，用口传穷人完全走到别的地方去讨论。哪知道干部早在门上派好四五个民兵站着岗，步枪上着剌刀，我们一个也出不去。怎么办泥？我们又二次口传，今天黑夜任何人不发表意见，要看事办事，大谅他也不能把我们几十个穷人全消灭掉。我们挤在一起，一言不发，瞪着眼看。政治主任等干部讲话了。第一句说我们要斗山西人。要本地人团结起来对付我们。第二句给我们戴上了特务帽子，说我们开的是特务会。就让民兵里的地主儿子将我和张丑则捆起来。共产党号召我们翻身，区干部亲自领导，现在我们变成了特务。大家忍不住的要起来拼掉他几个，可是又想到我们手无寸铁，人家有权有枪，只能忍着。只要李政委明天赶来，我们就有了办法。我和张丑则扣在冰冷的观音堂里，还要喂我们粪吃。幸亏往区上送信的人走的快，李政委来了一信，这才没把我们吊起。第二天天明，李政委和赵同志赶来。我们问赵同志是不是给我们做主到底。赵同志答复我们说：他要到别村去了，叫我们不要灰心，总有一天会翻透身。李政委还在这里。事情以后糟了，领导运动的大权又交给干部了。我们又变成了斗争对象。没地种没饭吃的郭车贵，以旧社会最低下的行道打鼓赚来几斗米，成了封建剥削，吃了一顿打，米和鼓也给弄走了。张丑则是佃户，三天被连打三次。一天一次打，我们受不了，我与张丑则商量：摆在眼前一条路，只有找咱的老根，去参加解放军。张丑则就丢下没饭吃的母亲参军走了。穷人们的翻身运动被这些恶霸、地主打垮了，恶霸吃的开了，王太顺由政治主任升成公安局里管理员，蒋成水由抗勤当了村长。\n    到了四五年冬天，地主害怕我们再来斗争，和干部在区公所和区长谈好，赶我出村，要我腾开租住的七间房子。宋世洪区长（女）照地主的意见给我判决了。我心里不服气，到县里找见周副县长，写了一信，让年后再搬。一封信恼了宋区长，把眼一瞪，说道：找县长也得腾房子，不腾扣起来。就这样的住了看守所。后来不知怎样，李政委把我放出来，又告我说：不要生气啦，给他腾开吧。接着由冯书记处理。地主家放的一个破缸，说是我用坏的，赔了新缸一个。又补上了三斗欠租。每年一石三斗米的房租，出了个整整齐齐，一颗不欠。全家八口人，在腊月十五离开了东崇贤。临起身时，五亩坡地种的山药蛋，地主平富贵和村长蒋成水说：地是他村的，东西也是他村的，不让我拿。我又问了周副县长才取走。全家走到离东崇贤五里地的泽井村留下。地主平富贵又到泽井去破坏，说我在他村落的是特务，别留他。泽井的武委会主任是穷人，他知道我们的困难，才说了两句硬话，把他给顶走，我才在泽井住下。\n    土地法大纲公布了，我又要说话。这些地主和坏干部这时候可要真正处理处理了。\n    （我官名叫傅银贵，小名傅小元，家住壶关泽井村。我自己不会写，找了个同志，我说，他给我写，又给我念了，我听的全对。如有一点差错，我愿当面和这些人来对话。）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 9th: Farmers in Yangjiapo Village, Xing County, which suffered severe disasters last year, are launching a surge of production and thrift, preparing for spring plowing, and have put forward the slogan \"Guarantee to survive the spring famine and strive not to starve people to death.\" The whole village has specifically stipulated the advance sowing of peas, spring wheat and other summer harvest crops, and the planting of more early-maturing spring vegetables. They are now preparing seeds, practicing thrift, mixing coarse grains and bran into meals, and confiscating the landlords' food, temporarily storing it all for use during spring plowing. Organize labor exchange. In the past, land and cattle were controlled by landlords and rich peasants, and labor exchange was difficult. Now that land and cattle have returned to the peasants, \"labor exchange is a good way to get ahead.\" It has been decided to form labor exchange groups centered on cattle to achieve deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and to exchange labor with other villages to exchange labor and fodder. Farm implements are uniformly adjusted by the entire administrative village, and landlords and rich peasants are urged to participate in labor. In winter production, some landlords have earned a lot of food. Now that there is more than a month before spring plowing, it has been decided to seize winter production, organize women to spin and weave, continue transportation, cut grass, and solve the problems of food rations and livestock fodder.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 9th: Amidst the famine relief efforts, individual remote villages have successively discovered incidents of rural gangsters and other bad elements leading the waste of struggle gains. Two retired bad cadres from Xinyaoshang and other three villages in Pian Guan County led more than 20 people to \"investigate\" the gains of the struggle, eating more than 270 jin of various noodles and more than 50 jin of pork and mutton in ten days. In Quan'er Shang Village, the county fought landlords and ate \"night meals,\" with 36 people eating 59 jin of pork at one time. Bad cadres in Majialiang, Lan County, even organized \"mass meals.\" In Xihui Village, Ke Lan County, 25 kilns of landlord's yams were sealed up, but no one took care of them, and half of them were spoiled. Wen Cunfu, a local bully in Shizhaizi Village, Jing Le County, pretended to be a \"poor peasant,\" controlled the farmers' association, slaughtered pigs and sheep, and ate and drank lavishly. These anti-revolutionary behaviors that violated the Outline Land Law and ignored the famine were exposed at the administrative village and district farmers' associations in various places, and the bad elements who led the waste were detained for investigation or dismissed from their posts.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 10th: Here, various agencies, factories, and troops have once again lowered their living standards to relieve the disaster. The Industrial Department of the Military Region issued a \"Letter to Workers,\" deciding to temporarily suspend the issuance of allowances to relieve disaster victims, and calling on workers to fight against difficulties with the spirit of the proletariat. The workers in various factories warmly supported this. The adult workers' congress of the 10th Factory of the Department decided to save one or two liang of rice per person per day. Workers at the 7th Factory carried stones and burned lime themselves to build workshops, saving the public more than 6 million yuan in lime purchase costs, all of which was donated to disaster relief. After a review campaign, a certain unit deeply experienced the difficulties of the working people and is now practicing thrift and launching a campaign to save a handful of rice per person per day. In five villages in the Jiaocheng border area of Jinzhong, more than 100 soldiers and civilians attacked Zhengjiazhuang, a stronghold of the Yan bandits, last month, and seized more than 3,000 jin of grain, which was distributed to everyone according to the degree of poverty. Farmers in various places are now stepping up the last month of winter production before spring plowing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥大力救灾渡荒  加紧冬季生产准备春耕  克服大吃大喝浪费现象\n\n1948-02-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    晋绥大力救灾渡荒\n    加紧冬季生产准备春耕\n    克服大吃大喝浪费现象\n    【新华社晋绥九日电】去年遭灾严重的兴县杨家坡村农民正展开生产节约与准备春耕的热潮，并提出“保证渡过春荒，争取不饿死人”的口号。全村已具体规定提前播种碗豆、春麦等夏收作物，并多种早熟的春菜，现在已着手筹备种籽，力行节约，饭内掺杂粮和糠，没收地主的食粮，暂全部封存，留下春耕时动用。组织变工，过去土地和耕牛掌握在地主富农手里，变工闹不好，现在土地耕牛都回了老家，“变工是翻身的好办法”，决定以牛为中心组成变工组做到深耕细作，并可与外村变工，换回人工和草料。农具由全行政村统一调剂，并督促地主富农参加劳动，在冬季生产中有的地主已赚下不少粮食。现在离春耕一个多月，决定抓紧冬季生产，组织妇女纺织，继续运输、割草、解决口粮和牲畜草料。\n    【新华社晋绥九日电】在救荒声中，此间个别偏僻村庄连续发现农村流氓及其他坏分子领头浪费斗争果实事件。偏关新窑上等三村两个退职坏干部，领导二十余人“清查”斗争果实，十天内吃掉各种面二百七十多斤、猪羊肉五十余斤。该县泉儿上村斗地主吃“夜餐”，三十六人一次就吃了五十九斤猪肉。岚县马家梁坏干部竟组织“大会餐”。苛岚西会村查封地主山药蛋二十五窑，无人保管，坏了一半。静乐石寨子村恶霸温存富冒充“贫农”，把持农会，杀猪宰羊，大吃大喝。这些违反土地法大纲及漠视渡荒的反革命行为，在各地行政村及区农会上被揭露后，已将领导浪费的坏分子扣押审查或予撤职。\n    【新华社晋绥十日电】此间各机关、工厂、部队为救灾再度降低生活水平。军区工业部发表“告工人书”，决定暂时停发津贴，救济灾民，并号召工人，用无产阶级的精神向困难作斗争，各工厂工人对此均热烈拥护。该部第十厂成年工人大会决定，每天每人节省一两米。第七厂工友为建筑工房，自己背石头烧石灰，为公家节省买石灰费用六百余万元，全部献出救灾。某部经过回忆运动，更深刻体验劳动人民的困难后，现正厉行节约，并掀起每人每天节约一把米运动。晋中交城边缘区某五个村百余军民，曾于上月攻入阎匪据点郑家庄，夺回被抢粮食三千余斤，按贫苦程度分给大家。各地农民现正加紧春耕前最后一个月的冬季生产。"

    "content": "Luoeryu Village in the Seventh District of Xingtai, the chairman of the Farmers' Association and also manager of the cooperative, Bai Quansheng, was a rich peasant before the War of Resistance, later becoming impoverished. In the past, he was the chairman of the Farmers' Association, he collapsed twice, this is the third time he has taken office, and he also serves as the manager of the cooperative. He and the village head and the director of the Armed Forces Committee are in cahoots, and he has a prostitute called Liu Guizhi. When the masses saw him, they could not call him by his name, they always had to call him \"Chairman Bai.\" Calling Liu Guizhi was \"Councillor Liu\" (she is a county councillor). Bai Quansheng and Liu Guizhi are openly sleeping together (Liu's husband's family is from Yingtou, she divorced two years ago and has not left, often living in Luoeryu), and she was also given a good house. This winter, even the families of revolutionary martyrs did not have firewood, but Bai Quansheng forced the masses to chop a rooftop full of good firewood for Liu Guizhi. When Bai Quansheng confiscated the property of traitors in the past few years, he embezzled twenty bolts of cloth, all of which he gave to Liu Guizhi.\n\n    During the mass movement last year, the masses were afraid of him and wanted to allocate a house to \"Chairman Bai.\" He said verbally: \"I am a cadre, let the masses be allocated first.\" In fact, he took all the stones and wood from the fruits [of struggle], and also took seven or eight bags of grain, saying it was for building a house. This spring he wanted to build a house, and forced the masses to give him \"le kuan\" (meaning donations) of 400,000 yuan, and also extracted 100,000 yuan from the cooperative. In total, he built one and a half courtyards (28 rooms) without using anything of his own. The workers who built the house were \"sent\" by the masses, he only made some meals with the fruits of the masses. Now the house he lives in, including the old ones in the past, totals three courtyards and two buildings. During the \"le kuan,\" Bai Quansheng insisted that Liu Zuocheng, a poor hired laborer who had been herding sheep for half his life and only returned from another village last year, had to provide \"le kuan,\" Liu Zuocheng had no money, so Bai Quansheng sealed up his house and did not let him go home for three months. Bai Quansheng took whatever stones he needed to build his house from Liu Zuocheng's yard (Liu Zuocheng was allocated a dilapidated yard, except for one good house, all the other houses had collapsed). He also took down Liu Zuocheng's gate and installed it on Liu Guizhi's gate.\n\n    There was a poor hired laborer named Liu Zuomin, who cut his hand in the autumn and could not work in the fields, so he walked around the streets. This winter, he joined the poor hired laborer group. Bai Quansheng threatened him, saying: \"You don't produce, and you still participate in the poor hired laborer group, are you planning to struggle against cadres?\" Liu Zuomin was a production team leader, but he was not called to meetings. At this time, bad people took the opportunity to threaten Liu Zuomin, saying: \"People want to struggle against you, this time they won't even call you to meetings.\" Liu Zuomin was very afraid from then on. Another time, the village held a women's meeting, after the meeting everyone else left, but Liu Zuomin's daughter-in-law was left behind, Bai Quansheng said to her: \"Your family has been liberated, your father-in-law and mother-in-law don't do anything now, and your brother is still in the Central Army, if you don't do anything, your family will be struggled against.\" When she went back and told him, Liu Zuomin was even more afraid. The next morning, just as he was worrying about what to do, Bai Quansheng sent his lackey Liu Tianru to Liu Zuomin's house to ask: \"Who is accusing our Chairman Bai?\" Liu Zuomin said: \"I don't know, I certainly didn't accuse him.\" Liu Tianru said again: \"You can't not know.\" After Liu Tianru left, Liu Zuomin was even more afraid, feeling that he couldn't live anyway, so he hanged himself outside the village. After Bai Quansheng discovered this, he deliberately pretended to look surprised, ran out and said: \"I don't know who killed our basic masses, this person's death is really a pity!\" Back in the village, he also held a mass meeting, and said to the masses: \"I don't know which bad element killed Liu Zuomin, this person is really a pity, our cadres just want to cry.\"\n\n    When Bai Quansheng saw district cadres going to someone's house, he would go to that house and ask: \"What did the district cadres say to you? What did you say to them?\" Making the masses afraid to say anything. Recently, Comrade Zhao Fushan, a district cadre, went to his village to carry out in-depth work, and Bai Quansheng also sent two people to follow him constantly.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 洛尔峪农会主席白泉生  逼死贫雇刘作民\n\n1948-02-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    洛尔峪农会主席白泉生\n    逼死贫雇刘作民\n    代笔者兴仁、景文\n    邢台七区洛尔峪村农会主席兼合作社经理白泉生，抗战前是富农，后来成了破落户。过去当农会主席，曾经垮过两次，这是第三次上台，并兼合作社经理。他和村长、武委会主任是一股劲，他搞着个破鞋叫刘桂芝。群众见了他不能叫名字，总得叫“白主席”。叫刘桂芝是“刘参议”（她是县参议员）。白泉生和刘桂芝是明铺夜盖（刘的婆家是营头人，前年离了婚就没走，经常住在洛尔峪），还给她分了一座好房子。今冬连抗属们都没柴火，白泉生却强迫群众给刘桂芝打了一房顶好柴。白泉生在前几年没收汉奸家产时，贪污了二十匹布，都给了刘桂芝。\n    去年群运时，群众因为怕他，要给“白主席”分房子。他口头上说：“咱是干部，先尽群众分吧”。实际上他把果实里的石头、木料完全拿了，还拿了七八布袋谷子，说是盖房子用。今年春天他要盖房子，强迫群众给他“乐款”（捐款的意思）四十万元，又在合作社抽了十万元。共盖了一串半院（二十八间），没用他自己一点东西。盖房用的工，还是群众“送的”，他只是拿上群众果实，做了些饭。现在他家住的房子，连上过去旧有的，共三串院子、两座楼。在“乐款”时，白泉生非叫放了半辈子羊、去年才从外村回来的雇贫刘作成“乐款”不行，刘作成没有钱，白泉生就查封了他的房子，三个月不叫他回家。白泉生盖房子用啥石头，就到刘作成院里起（刘作成分的是个破院，除一个好房子外，其他房都塌了）。还把刘作成的大门摘了，按到刘桂芝门上。\n    有一个贫雇叫刘作民，秋天把手砍伤，不能上地，好在街上走，今冬参加了贫雇小组。白泉生就吓唬他说：“你不生产，还参加什么贫雇组，打算斗干部？”刘作民是个生产小组长，开会也不叫他去。这时，就有坏人乘机威胁刘作民说：“人家想斗争你呀，这次连会也不叫你参加了”。刘作民自此以后非常害怕。又有一次村里开妇女会，散会后别人都走了，偏把刘作民的儿媳妇留下，白泉生给她说：“你家翻身了，你老公公和你婆子，现在啥也不干，你哥哥还在中央军里，如果你们再不动弹，就要斗争你家。”他回去一说，刘作民更害了怕。第二天早晨正发愁的没办法，白泉生就叫他手下的狗腿刘天如到刘作民家问：“到底是谁告咱白主席来？”刘作民说：“我不知道，我反正没有告他。”刘天如又说：“你不能不知道。”刘天如走后，刘作民更加害怕，觉得自己反正是活不成，就到村外上吊死了。白泉生发觉这事后，还故意装样子，跑出去说：“不知谁把咱基本群众害死了，这人死的真可惜呀！”回村里还开了个群众会，给群众说：“不知哪个坏分子害死刘作民，这人真可惜，我们干部光想哭”。\n    白泉生看见区干部到谁家，就到谁家问：“区干部给你说些啥？你给他们说过什么？”弄的群众都不敢吭。最近区干部赵富山同志在他村深入搞工作，白泉生还派了两个人经常跟着他。"

    "content": "【Taihang News】 Fu Yutang and Zhao Jin, cadres from the district, and Ren Yuexian, a cadre from the county in Shexian County, discovered in their recent in-depth visits to poor peasants and hired laborers to hear their grievances, that they are still suffering from the landlords' cruel exploitation through rent. In Zhao Yu Village, due to the landlords and rich peasants holding power, they have been suppressing the peasants. The village chief, Fu Liangzhu, is an old rich peasant (who still hires long-term laborers), the political director, Fu Linlu, is a well-to-do middle peasant (who was even allocated 2.8 mu of good land in the winter of 1946); the deputy political director, Fu De, is a rich peasant; the director of the militia committee, Fu Jintian, is a bankrupt landlord; and the cooperative accountant, Fu Yuting, is a landlord (poor people are still pawning their land to him; he has not only never been struggled against but was even allocated a large poplar tree). The poor peasant Liu Chuncheng complained: \"I am still pawning four mu of land from Liu Fushuo (a rich peasant) and renting five dilapidated houses from Wang Cunde (a landlord), paying five dou of rent grain each year, for a total of 35 years. I was just emancipated in the winter of the year before last (1946). I proposed to the farmers' association that I wanted to sever these pawned lands and rented houses, but the political director got angry and said that Wang Cunde was not a rich peasant, 'There are no landlords in our village.' The cadres are protecting them, and nothing was touched. And that's not all, the cadres insisted that I redeem the land pawned to Liu Fushuo, but the district cadres didn't allow it in the end. Last winter (1946), I still paid five dou of rent grain for the houses rented from the finance director. Look at Wang Haoxian and eight other landlord and rich peasant families, they are still raising more than 150 sheep. Zhao Sanlou (a landlord) even used 150,000 yuan to buy a donkey. Now the Land Law says that feudalism will be completely abolished, and I am very happy, and just hope I can truly be emancipated this time!\" The main problem in Ganquan Village is also that some cadres are protecting landlords and rich peasants. To this day, four poor peasant households – Ning Yunqing, Ning Shuangting, Ning Shuiting, and Ning Laoer – are still renting more than six mu of good land from the rich peasant Ning Shichang, paying one old dou (40 jin) of wheat per mu in May and three old dou (120 jin) of millet per mu in autumn. Last year (1947), the harvest was poor, with only 70% yield on two mu of land, and they still paid 1.6 dou of rent wheat. The remaining land yielded nothing, and they didn't pay any rent. After the Land Law was promulgated, on the seventh day of the twelfth lunar month this year, the mother of the landlord Ning Shichang even went to the poor peasant Ning Shuiting's house to demand rent, saying that not a single grain could be spared. She even stayed overnight in Shuiting's house and urinated on the kang, bullying them to the extreme. The next day, Shuiting complained to the cadres, who still adopted persuasive methods, \"mobilizing\" Shichang's mother to go back, but to no avail. In the end, she was forcibly dragged out. Only now has she been placed under control.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 涉县赵峪、甘泉两村  地主至今还收重租\n\n1948-02-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    涉县赵峪、甘泉两村\n    地主至今还收重租\n    【太行消息】涉县赵峪、甘泉两村，区上干部傅玉堂、赵锦和县里干部任月先在最近深入贫雇访苦中，发现他们至今还受着地主残酷的租佃剥削。赵峪由于地主富农掌权，一直压制农民。该村村长傅良柱是老富农（现在还雇着长工），政治主任傅林禄是富裕中农（四六年冬还分了二亩八分好地）；副政治主任傅德是富农；武委会主任傅锦天是破落地主；合作社会计傅玉廷是地主（至今穷人还典他的地，以前不但没挨过斗，反分了个大杨树），贫农刘春成诉苦说：“现在我还是典的人家刘富所（富农）四亩地，租的财政主任王存德（地主）五间破房子，每年出五斗租谷，一共租了卅五年啦。前年（四六年）冬天刚翻身，我在农会提出要割了这些典地租房，政治主任发了火，说王存德不是富农，“咱村就没地主”。干部包庇，人家一点东西也没动。这还不算，干部非叫我把典的刘富所的地给赎回去不可，后来还是区干部没让。租的财政主任家房子，去冬（四六年）还是给人家出了五斗租谷。再看人家王好先等八家地主富农，还喂着一百五十多只羊，赵三楼（地主）还用十五万块钱买了头驴。这回土地法说要把封建一律取消，我很高兴，就看这回可真能翻身了吧？！”甘泉村主要也是有些干部包庇地主富农。至今宁云青、宁双庭、宁水庭、宁老二等四户贫农，还租着富农宁石昌六亩多好地，每亩地五月出租麦一老斗（四十斤），秋天出租米三老斗（一百二十斤）。去年（四七年）收成不好，只有二亩地收七成，还交租麦一斗六升，其余地一籽没见，也没交租。土地法公布后，在今年阴历腊月初七，地主宁石昌的母亲，竟然还到贫农宁水庭家逼要租子，说一粒也不能少，晚上并住在水庭家，又往炕上屙尿，欺侮至极。第二天，水庭找着干部诉苦，干部还采取说服办法，“动员”石昌的母亲回去，结果无效，最后还是硬拉出去。现在才算是管制起来啦。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Principal Fan's Speech\n    Another report: Peking University Principal Fan made a speech at the school's ideological education meeting against the landlord element Zhai Moxin, which stated in brief: \"Today's meeting was very successful. The comrades who attended demonstrated a high degree of seriousness and a high degree of class indignation. This shows that the comrades' revolutionary understanding has greatly improved in the land reform study.\n\n    Zhai Moxin, this stubbornly unenlightened class alien element, infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party. This is proven by the facts everyone has stated, without a doubt. Now that the landlord and rich peasant elements have been purged, the masses undoubtedly have indignation, and demand his expulsion from the Party, removal from his post, and referral to the People's Court, is that good? Good. The opinions of everyone should be carefully considered by the Academic Committee. Please rest assured. However, I will announce again here that the purpose of studying land reform is to transform ideology. Fifteen hundred comrades at Peking University must get rid of bad ideas and expand Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades must firmly grasp this guiding principle. Point out the two paths of revolution and counter-revolution, explain the principles clearly, and except for those who are extremely stubborn, I think everyone is willing to take the path of light. We are reasonable people, and if the principles are explained clearly, those who are still stubborn and unwilling to change will be dealt with by other means. All Party members and non-Party comrades in our school should obey the Party Central Committee's principles and policies. The Party Central Committee's instruction is to oppose the physical elimination of landlords. As long as the landlords lower their heads, surrender their weapons, do not resist, and are willing to work, they will be allocated a piece of land to let them work. Through labor, they can even change their class status within a certain period of time. Our hatred is class hatred, which is to eliminate classes, not to eliminate human beings.\n\n    In the study, the faults of not being serious and not being upright must be opposed and eliminated. What should be investigated must be investigated, and what should be questioned must also be questioned. Whether it is investigation or questioning, it cannot deviate from the facts or be unreasonable. It is not good to simply and rigidly question. Because ideological transformation is delicate and long-term, engaging in it clumsily will cause great harm, and we must be cautious.\n\n    From the materials revealed by everyone about Zhai Moxin, we can draw the following experience: It is not terrible for class enemies to attack us from the outside, but it is troublesome to have them sneak into the revolutionary camp to sabotage. Class alien elements sabotage the revolution with three characters. Zhai Moxin's reactionary words and deeds can be used as proof. I will now point out these three characters. See if they are right? First: infiltrate. Second: provoke. Third: destroy. Zhai Moxin infiltrated the Party. He himself said that he wanted to become a member of the Party Central Committee at the age of fifty, wanting to infiltrate the Party's general headquarters to carry out sabotage, his ambition was very big. Once infiltrated, he would provoke. The facts about his provocations that the comrades discussed at the meeting were numerous. In short, he spread rumors, stirred up trouble, sowed discord, and used emotional appeals to create sectarianism. The purpose of provocation is destruction. The most important thing for the revolution is unity. Of course, our unity is based on principles. We must unite like steel, but he uses various methods to destroy unity and sow discord. ... Zhai Moxin infiltrated the Party in 1939. After nearly ten years of infiltration, wasn't he still exposed in front of the masses? Not only those who have infiltrated, provoked, and destroyed should confess; even those who have such thoughts should also reflect on themselves well during this study. That is one point.\n\n    Second point: Zhai Moxin, what does the facts prove him to be? He is a despotic landlord. He is filled with landlord and rich peasant ideology, and has no trace of Marxism-Leninism. Do we have landlord and rich peasant ideology in our minds? More or less, we all do. We come from a semi-feudal society, so it is not surprising to have landlord and rich peasant ideology. As long as we examine ourselves and transform ourselves, we will not necessarily become landlord and rich peasant elements. We must shrink the landlord and rich peasant ideology in our minds bit by bit. Otherwise, if it expands, it will be very dangerous. Eliminate the landlord and rich peasant ideology in our minds as soon as possible. Our revolutionary nature will become stronger. ...\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 范校长讲话\n\n1948-02-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    范校长讲话\n    又讯：北大范校长在该校反地主分子翟墨新思想教育大会上发言，略称：“今天的大会很成功。各位到会的同志，表现出高度的严肃性，和高度的阶级义愤。这说明在土改学习中，同志们的革命认识大大提高了一步。\n    翟墨新这个执迷不悟的阶级异己分子，是混进中国共产党来的。这由大家所讲的事实，千真万确地证明了。地富分子，被清算出来了，群众不成问题要义愤，要求开除他的党籍，撤消职务，送交人民法庭，好不好？好。大家的意见，学委总会要好好的考虑，请大家放心。不过我在这里再宣布一下，学习土改为的是改造思想。北大一千五百个同志，都要把坏思想去掉，扩大马列主义——毛主席思想。同志们要好好掌握这一方针。指出革命、反革命两条道路，把道理讲清楚，除十分顽固者外，我想都愿往光明大道走的。我们是讲道理的，道理讲清楚，还很顽固不改者，我们另有处分的办法。我校党员与非党同志都应当服从党中央的方针与政策，党中央的指示是反对肉体消灭地主。地主只要低了头、缴了械、不反抗、肯劳动，就分配一份土地给他，让他劳动，经过劳动还能在一定的时间内改变其成份。我们的仇恨，是阶级仇恨，是消灭阶级，不是消灭人体。\n    在学习中，不严肃不正派的毛病，是必须反对与肃清的。当查的应查，当追问的也要追问。无论是查或追问，总不能脱离事实与不讲道理，一味生硬的追问是不好的。因为思想改造是细腻而长期的，鲁笨从事，为害甚大，不可不慎。\n    大家对翟墨新所揭发的材料，得出这样的经验：阶级敌人从外面来攻击我们并不可怕，而钻到革命阵营里边来破坏，就麻烦。阶级异己分子破坏革命有三个字，翟墨新的反动言行可作证明，我现在把这三个字指出来，大家看对不对？第一个：钻。第二个：挑。第三个：破。翟墨新他是钻到党内来的，他自己说到五十岁时要当党中央委员，想钻到党的总司令部里进行破坏，野心大的很。钻进了就要挑。他的挑拨，同志们在会上谈的事实很多，总之是造谣生事，挑拨离间，感情拉拢，闹宗派。挑的目的是破坏。革命最要紧的是团结，当然我们的团结是有原则的，我们要团结得象钢铁一般，但是他用各种方法破坏团结，挑拨离间。…………翟墨新一九三九年钻进党来，钻了近十年，还不是在群众面前揭露了吗？不仅有钻、挑、破的行为的人要坦白；连有这类思想的人，在这次学习中也应当好好反省。这是一点。\n    第二点：翟墨新，事实证明他是什么？是恶霸地主。他一脑子地富思想，毫无马列主义气味。我们脑子里是否有地富思想？或多，或少，都有。我们是从半封建社会来的，有地富思想，不奇怪。我们只要检讨与改造，不一定变成地富分子。我们要把脑子的地富思想一点一点缩小，不然，扩大起来，很危险。脑子中的地富思想尽快消灭了。革命性就会强大起来。…………”"

    "content": "Many Landlords Eat, Drink, and Live Lavishly; Cadres Cover Up Those Who Haven't Been Struggled Against\n\nWhat is the situation of the landlords? Until now, most landlords still live better than the peasants. Because in the past, except for the properties of the escaped landlords which were completely confiscated, other landlords retained a portion of land of good quality, and it was only exchanged after the autumn harvest last year. In this way, the grain harvested by the landlords in the autumn remained untouched. This was the fault of the former political director Duan Bingnan, the farmers' association director Duan Laiyou, and other village cadres. When exchanging the land, they advocated letting the landlords harvest the autumn grain before the exchange, and then struggling against them after the exchange. But afterwards, there was no struggle, allowing most landlords and rich peasants to eat, drink, and live lavishly. From the 17th to the 19th of the old lunar November, the landlord Zhang Wei bought cigarettes from the cooperative four times. Zhang Shumei, Zhang Shutian, and Zhang Laoxian often bought noodles, green sauce, and fermented bean curd from the cooperative. Moreover, judging from the cooperative's accounts, landlords could buy things on credit, but poor people couldn't. Poor peasant Duan Guangyun said: \"We are afraid of not being able to get credit, so we dare not even ask about it.\"\n\nSome old rich men are shielded by cadres and have not been struggled against. Take Zhang Liang as an example. In the past, he had more than 20 mu of land of his own, and rented more than 50 mu from Chang Shan's mother's family, raised mules, and hired laborers. During the land reform, he only contributed a little land, and none of the floating wealth was touched. Now he is still the manager of the cooperative's steamed bun shop. Once he gets involved in this business, he doesn't allow anyone else to open a steamed bun shop. If you want to sell steamed buns, you can only buy them from him, and you are not allowed to buy them from other villages. The masses believe that the cooperative manager, Zhang Wenbin, is a feudal rich peasant and was still given dividends.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不少地主大吃二喝  干部包庇的还没斗\n\n1948-02-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    不少地主大吃二喝\n    干部包庇的还没斗\n    地主的情况怎么样呢？直到现在，大部分的地主，还比农民的生活好。因为过去除了逃亡地主的家产全部没收以外，其他地主都留下一部分质量好的土地，到去年秋收以后才换了换。这样，地主秋季收的粮食就没有动。这是前任政治主任段炳南、农会主任段来友等村干部捣的鬼。换地的时候，他们主张让地主收了秋粮再换，换罢再斗。可是以后就没有斗，使大部分地主富农还大吃二喝。从旧历十一月十七到十九日，地主张炜到合作社买了四回纸烟。张树梅、张树田、张老宪常到合作社买挂面、青酱、豆腐乳等。而且从合作社的帐上来看，地主能赊东西，穷人就办不到。贫农段光云说：“咱就怕赊不出来，才不敢张嘴说赊东西。”\n    有的老财，叫干部包庇起来，没有斗。象张亮，过去自己有二十多亩地，又租了长善娘家五十多亩，喂着骡子，雇着长工。土地改革当中，只献了点地，浮财一点没动。现在还当着合作社馍馍坊的经理。他一搞这个买卖，就再也不准别人开馍馍坊，要是贩卖馍馍，也只能到他那里去贩，不准到外村去贩。合作社经理张文斌，群众认为他是封建富农，还分了果实。"

    "content": "The Problem of Small Villages Cannot Be Ignored: Leaders Rely on \"Meritorious Servants,\" Separating Themselves from the Masses; Chang Fan Village Cadre Monopolizes Fruits of Struggle\n\n    [Ci County News] Chang Fan Village is a relatively poor village of 305 people, only three *li* away from Pengcheng Town. From its liberation in August 1945 until September of last year, the district office never sent a work team member to reside in the village. They always thought that with the leadership of Kong Fanchang (actually a rogue) who had made outstanding contributions during the War of Resistance, there would be no problems, and entrusted everything to him alone. Kong Fanchang was one of the three major cadres in the village, serving as the director of civil education and general manager of the cooperative, holding all power. The chairman of the farmers' association, Tian Shulu, was someone who offended no one, tried to please everyone (both poor peasants and landlords said he was good), and had no class stance. The vice chairman of the workers' union, Chen Wenxiu, obeyed Kong Fanchang in everything. The masses reflected: \"Kong Fanchang's mouth, Chen Wenxiu's legs.\" Liu Wuwei (the current political director, one of the three minor cadres of the past) said: Young cadres and militia members were arguing in the room, but as soon as they heard Kong Fanchang \"humph\" once, they became silent. With great power in his hands, he acted recklessly, controlling the distribution of the fruits of struggle and managing everything in the cooperative. He openly engaged in illicit affairs in the village. Later, after the Party made it public, he became the political director, and no one dared to provoke him even more. During the anti-traitor and revenge period in January 1946, a total of 32,660 yuan were struggled back over a period of forty days. After the struggle ended, when the masses requested to borrow the struggle funds, Kong Fanchang said: This money was for the traitors who wanted to shoot me and Kong Lingjiao who had already been killed, so this money should belong to us. The chairman of the farmers' association and the township head used this money to trade grain in the village and town, Kong Fanchang used it freely, and the cadres borrowed it freely, eating and drinking lavishly. Poor peasant Lin Guangyin reflected: \"We accompanied them for forty days for nothing!\" When 70 *mu* of dry land and 2 *mu* of paddy land were distributed in April 1946 (the village had an average of 0.0167 *mu* of paddy land per person), Kong Fanchang told the appraisers: Distribute the 2 *mu* of paddy land to Suo Youliang! The appraisers had to comply. It turned out that Kong Fanchang was openly having an affair with Suo Youliang's sister-in-law, and he even incited her to marry him. During the large-scale land reform movement in July, after a month of struggle, 205,000 yuan were struggled back. When it came to the distribution, Kong Fanchang told Chen Wenxiu: \"I want to get married and need 50,000 yuan.\" Chen Wenxiu told the appraisers, and 50,000 yuan were distributed to him. The other twelve cadres received 30,000 yuan, the thirteen militiamen received 30,000 yuan, the twelve families of revolutionary soldiers received 50,000 yuan, and the 96 masses and 53 members of the women's association each received 200 yuan, totaling 30,600 yuan. Regardless of whether they were landlords, rich peasants, poor peasants, or middle peasants, as long as they attended the meeting, they were divided equally by person and class. Landlord and old team leader Kong Fanwei, and landlord and logistics director Kong Lingcai, were actively working, so they each received 2,500 yuan, the same as the cadres. The bankrupt landlord and village secretary Suo Guangrong received 3,000 yuan, the same as the top cadres. His brother Suo Guangyin received 2,000 yuan as a militiaman's share. Suo Yougong, who had been struggled against, received 1,000 yuan. Poor peasant Lin Guangyin did not want the 200 yuan he was given, but the cadres insisted on giving it to him, and he resentfully bought half a catty of pork and ate it.\n\n    During the filling-in period in November, 199,300 yuan were struggled. 23,300 yuan were spent on buying leather belts and fur hats for the militia, 14,200 yuan were spent on buying white cloth to make coats for the militia and for travel expenses, 96,000 yuan were spent on Kong Fanchang buying a pistol and pistol bullets, 37,000 yuan were spent on preferential treatment for soldiers during the New Year, and the remaining 28,800 yuan were deposited with the chairman of the farmers' association.\n\n    In total, in the distribution of the above-mentioned fruits of struggle, Kong Fanchang received over 160,000 yuan, accounting for 30.66% of the total amount of money, which was equivalent to the amount received by 2304 men and women from the masses. The 4,170 yuan he received by falsely claiming to be a family member of a revolutionary soldier was not included. 132,300 yuan were spent on buying rifles and bullets, accounting for 31.55%. The twelve cadres received 199,790 yuan, accounting for 24.66%, with each cadre receiving the equivalent of the fruits of struggle received by 152 people from the masses. (The 43,200 yuan temporarily stored with the chairman of the farmers' association was not included, as it was used as a flexible fund for cadres to borrow.) The thirteen militiamen received 67,500 yuan, equivalent to 1683 catties of rice, accounting for 3.73% (including the money distributed to the militia, and the money spent on buying leather belts, fur hats, overcoat cloth, and travel expenses). Each militiaman received the equivalent of the fruits of struggle received by 25 people from the masses. The twelve family members of revolutionary soldiers received 87,000 yuan, accounting for 5%, with each family member receiving the equivalent of the fruits of struggle received by 31 people from the masses. The 96 men from the masses received 20,000 yuan, accounting for 1.27%. The 53 members of the women's association received 10,600 yuan, accounting for 0.67%. Each time the cadres hosted a banquet, they wasted 9,060 yuan (for a total of 40 people), accounting for 2.24%. One meal was equivalent to the fruits of struggle received by 168 people from the masses. Other furniture, clothing, and farm tools were distributed without discussion, and the cadres said, \"Whoever needs what, just pick it!\" The masses rushed to take things, and relatives and friends generously gave way to each other, \"You need this, so I'll give it to you.\" Wang Lizheng, an old bachelor who had been a long-term worker for over 50 years and had no land, saw that no one was letting him have anything, so he left. Later, someone brought him a small table, and he said, \"Am I going to have a landlord's table to eat at!\" Old peasant Kong Qinglu said, \"I only received two tattered pairs of pants and a tattered quilt in the struggle.\" The cadres said, \"Poor peasants don't have livestock, so it's useless to distribute plows and seeders.\" Therefore, they were all distributed to middle peasant households, or newly turned middle peasant households.\n\n    Kong Fanchang, after being patiently educated by the Pengcheng District Committee of the Communist Party in September of last year, still stubbornly clung to his mistakes despite several self-criticisms, and refused to bow his head to the masses. At a mass meeting of the entire village, the district committee accepted the opinions of the masses and announced his expulsion from the Party and the removal of his position as political director. However, the excess fruits of struggle he had seized had not yet been returned.\n        (Ci County Joint Cooperative Communication Group: Miao Liming, Wang Gonglin, Yi Fu)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不能忽视小村问题  领导上依靠“功臣”脱离群众  常范村干独吞果实\n苗立明  王功林  一夫\n1948-02-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    不能忽视小村问题\n    领导上依靠“功臣”脱离群众\n    常范村干独吞果实\n    【磁县消息】常范村是离彭城镇只三里，有三百零五人的比较穷苦的小村。自从一九四五年八月解放到去年九月以前，区公所从来没派过一个工作员去这村住过，总以为他村有在抗战中功绩卓著的孔凡昌（实际是个流氓）的领导，保险出不了问题，一切都委靠他一人掌管。孔凡昌在村是三大干部之一，任民教主任兼合作社总经理，一切大权在握。农会主席田书禄是一个谁都不惹、两头落好（贫农和地主都说他好），没阶级立场的人。副工会长陈文秀是一切服从孔凡昌。群众反映：“孔凡昌的嘴，陈文秀的腿”。刘五味（现任政治主任，是过去三小干部之一）说：青年干部民兵正在房内吵闹，一听孔凡昌“哼”一声，就鸦雀无声了。他的大权在手，胡作胡为，掌握斗争果实的分配，管理合作社的一切。在村公开搞破鞋，后来经过党公开，担任了政治主任，更是没人敢惹了。一九四六年一月反奸复仇时期，前后共斗争了四十天，斗争回洋三二六六○○元。斗争结束后，群众要求借用斗争款，孔凡昌说：这是汉奸要打我的黑枪和已打死的孔令椒的，这款应归我们所有。农会长和乡长等拿这款去和村镇贩卖粮食，孔凡昌自由使用，干部们自由借用，大吃大喝。贫农吝光银反映：“我们争了四十天全是陪伴了！”四六年四月分配七十亩旱地，二亩水地时（该村每人平均水地一分六七），孔凡昌告评议员说：将二亩水地分给索有良！评议员只得照办。原来孔凡昌与索有良弟妇公开搞破鞋，他还挑拨人家和他结婚。七月土地改革大运动时期，经过一个月斗争，斗回二○五○○○元，在分配时孔凡昌告陈文秀：“我要娶老婆，用洋五万元”。陈文秀就转告评议员，就分给他五万元。其他干部十二人，分三万元，民兵十三人分三万元，抗属十二人分五万元，群众九十六人，妇女会五十三人，每人各批二百元，共三万零六百元。不管地主、富农、贫农、中农只要到会，按人按类平分。地主、老年队长孔凡为和地主、抗勤主任孔令才，因工作积极，都分到干部分二千五百元，破落地主村书记索光荣，批到头等干部分三千元，其弟索光银，批民兵果实二千元，被斗户索有功，批洋一千元；贫农吝光银不要分的二百元，干部们硬给了他，他气恨的买了半斤猪肉吃了。\n    十一月填补时期，斗争了一九九三○○元，给民兵买皮带、毛帽花洋二三三○○元，给民兵买白布做大衣拿盘费花洋一四二○○元，孔凡昌要买手枪和手枪子弹花九六○○○元，过年优抗花洋三七○○○元，余洋二八八○○元存在农会长手中。\n    总计以上果实的分配，孔凡昌得十六万余元，合占全部果实款百分之三○·六六，顶住二三○四个男女群众分的。假充抗属分到一份果实四一七○元未计在内。买长枪、子弹花洋一三二三○○元，合占百分之三一·五五。干部十二人得一九九七九○元，占百分之二四·六六，每干部顶住一五二个群众得果实。（暂存农会长手中的四三二○○元，经当作干部借用的机动款，没算在内。）民兵十三人分到六七五○○元，合米一六八三斤，占百分之三·七三，（指给民兵分的款、买皮带、毛帽、大衣布、盘费都在内）每个民兵顶住二五个群众所得的果实。抗属十二人分到八七○○○元，占百分之五，每个抗属顶三十一个群众所得果实。男群众九十六人，分二万元，占百分之一·二七。妇女会五十三人，分一○六○○元，占百分之○·六七。干部们每请客一次浪费九○六○元（共四十人），占百分之二·二四。吃一顿等于群众一六八人所得果实。其他在分配家具、衣服、农具时，也不评议，干部说：“谁需啥拣啥！”群众都纷纷去取，亲族厚友都相互尽让，“你缺这给你。”一个住过五十余年长工的外来户一亩地没有的老光棍汉王立正，看看人家没有人尽让自己，他就走，后来别人给他搬来一个小桌，他说：“咱还闹个老财桌子吃饭咧！”贫农孔庆禄老汉说：“我在斗争中只分到两条烂裤子，一个烂被子。”干部说：“贫农没牲口，分犁耧没有用。”因此都分给中农户，或翻透身的新中农户。\n    孔凡昌于去年九月经彭城中共区委会耐心教育，虽经过几次反省，仍然固执错误，不向群众低头。在全村群众大会上区委会接受群众意见，宣布开除他的党籍，行政上撤消他的政治主任职务，但多余侵占的斗争果实还未退出。\n        （磁县县联社通讯小组苗立明、王功林、一夫）"

All army personnel should intensify their land reform studies, correctly understand and grasp the spirit of the Outline Land Law of China. Participate in the Speak Bitterness and Revenge movement, raise class consciousness, and no one is allowed to stand outside of this study movement.\n    II. Actively support all the legitimate demands and just actions of the peasant masses, and closely integrate various forms of armed struggle with the land reform movement, especially armed forces and local armed forces (including militia) in border areas adjacent to the enemy, should actively eliminate or strike at enemy offensives and disturbances in order to cover the land reform struggle. Strictly suppress the conspiracies and sabotage activities of feudal forces and bandit special agents.\n    III. All rear service units, organs, and schools should organize village work committees and land reform work teams (selecting cadres with necessary work experience, a better mass perspective, better class composition, and a clearer class stance to participate). Under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, actively participate in the land reform movement and the anti-espionage and anti-traitor struggle. Temper the ideological consciousness of every cadre, party member, and soldier in the torrent of land reform, making them strong proletarian fighters.\n    IV. Cadres who come from landlord or rich peasant backgrounds or whose families are landlords or rich peasants should resolutely abandon their original class stance. First, they should set an example by handing over their land and property to the peasants for disposal (treating themselves the same as the peasants). After unsuccessful persuasion of reactionary landlord and rich peasant families, they should resolutely sever all ideological and economic ties with them.\n    V. Worker-peasant cadres should not forget their roots, and should constantly persuade their landlord and rich peasant wives, families, relatives, and friends to strictly draw class lines; there must be no favoritism or protectionism under the guise of public interest.\n    VI. Military dependents, families of martyrs, and honorary soldiers should be respected and loved by the broad masses of the people. However, in land issues, they can only receive the same amount of land as the basic masses. Any extra land received in the past should also be automatically handed over to the peasant association for redistribution. No special treatment should be requested in land distribution issues.\n    VII. Those sons and daughters and their families of landlord and rich peasant elements who have infiltrated the army, organs, factories, and hospitals as air-raid shelters in the land reform in order to escape the peasant struggle should be immediately and unconditionally purged once these bad elements are discovered.\n    VIII. Those who can abide by the above articles in the land reform movement and achieve effective results should be given certain commendations and rewards; otherwise, they should be severely criticized and punished, and in severe cases, expelled from the Party and military and handed over to the local peasant association for handling.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东军区颁发土改命令  全军学习土地法  武装斗争与土地改革密切结合\n\n1948-02-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    华东军区颁发土改命令\n    全军学习土地法\n    武装斗争与土地改革密切结合\n    【新华社华东十二日电】迟到消息：华东军区于去年十二月十五日颁发土改命令，摘要如下：\n    一、全军人员应加紧土改学习，正确认识和掌握中国土地法大纲的精神。参加诉苦复仇运动，提高阶级觉悟，不准有任何人站在这一学习运动之外。二、积极支持农民群众一切的正当要求与正义行动，并使各种形式的武装斗争与土改运动密切结合起来，特别是边沿区接敌区的武装部队和地方武装（包括民兵），应积极的消灭或打击敌人之进攻与出扰，借以掩护土改斗争。并对封建势力匪特分子的阴谋破坏活动，严予镇压。三、所有后方部队机关学校，应组织驻村工作委员会与土改工作队（挑选具有必须的工作经验与群众观念较好、阶级成分较好、阶级立场较明确的干部参加）。在当地党委统一领导下，积极参加土改运动与反特防奸斗争。并在土改的洪流中锻炼每个干部、党员、战士的思想意识，使之成为坚强的无产阶级的战士。四、出身地主富农或家庭为地主富农的干部，应当坚决抛弃原来的阶级立场。首先以身作则，拿出自己的土地财产交农民处理（自己照样与农民同等的一份）。对反动的地主富农家庭于劝导无效之后，应坚决断绝和他的一切思想与经济的联系。五、工农干部则不应忘本，对于地主富农的老婆，家庭及亲戚朋友应随时劝导，严格划清阶级界线；不得有任何假公济私与包庇袒护行为。六、军属、烈属、荣誉军人应受到广大人民的尊敬与爱护。但在土地问题上只能与基本群众分得同等土地。过去多得的土地，亦应自动交与农会重新分配。不得要求在土地分配问题上有所特殊。七、凡是在土改中地主富农成分子弟及其家属，为了逃避农民斗争而混入部队、机关、工厂、医院作为防空洞者，这些坏分子一经查明，应立即无条件洗刷出去。八、凡在土改运动中能遵守上述各条并著有成效者，应受到一定的表扬和奖励；否则应予以严厉批评与处罚，重者开除党籍军籍，交当地农会处理。"

In 1942, we sold the houses, and a rich neighbor forcibly bought them for 600 yuan (we could have sold them to someone else for 900 yuan). I hoped the Eighth Route Army would come to avenge us. As soon as the Eighth Route Army arrived, I became the director of the Military Affairs Committee. At that time, the village's labor organizers, secretaries, and warehouse directors were all landlords. During the Ping-Han Campaign, I worked hard, only thinking about avenging this grievance. But during this period, my thinking became tainted by the landlords. I thought that since I was a cadre, I should get some clothes. Then I started messing around with a \"broken shoe.\" This \"broken shoe\" wasn't from a family that had been struggled against, but she was very rich. She would do anything for me – shoes, clothes. After messing around with her for a few months, the political commissar of the Ninth District sent a letter saying that my behavior was not good. When we struggled against this woman, I didn't agree in my heart and actively covered up for the \"broken shoe.\" Comrade Yang Fengtong sent a letter saying that if I continued like this, I would have no status; if I worked hard, I would have status. My thinking changed a little, and later, because I worked well, I joined the Party.\n\nWhen I went to Anyang to participate in the turning-over team, I thought I finally had status. I got myself a wife and then participated in the turning-over team in six or seven days. I went to Jiang Village in the Sixth District of Anyang. The district chief used to be a temple keeper and didn't have much ability. I looked down on him. Whenever there was something to do, he would discuss it with me and ask me what to do. I looked down on him for being a temple keeper; this was forgetting my roots and looking down on the Party.\n\nWhen I was working in Gangtou Village, Ma Xuerong was the village chief and acting political director. He was very bad. His brother was a militiaman. When the higher-ups called for expanding the army, they said we shouldn't force people but mobilize them. He didn't mobilize his own brother. The public security officer was in the same family as him, and he said, \"Whoever mobilizes him, he will jump into the well.\" The masses said, \"If we expel him from the army expansion team, the bad egg will be gone, and it will be easier to expand the army.\" Someone volunteered and suggested others, and suddenly six people were found. First, I blocked the director of the Military Affairs Committee, and as a result, several people were exposed. Now I检讨 that I didn't do well at that time. The masses pointed out that the public security officer was bad, and I promised to resolve it, but after the soldiers left, I didn't do anything about it. The public security officer was a Party member, and I shielded all of these people. This is forgetting my roots.\n\nMarriage problem: There was an eighteen-year-old girl who wanted to terminate her marriage, and I gave her a divorce, preparing for my subordinate cadres to marry her. My intention was to gain a good reputation.\n\nMy thoughts these past few days: I am very willing to learn and want to open my mind. But when I listened to the report, I felt ashamed to talk about my own affairs and was afraid that the Party wouldn't want me. After talking with the county Party committee, I thought I must tell the truth, and in the future, I must let the masses know. If I don't tell the truth, I will be letting everyone down. The county Party committee said, \"You are a worker; where does your wavering come from?\" I haven't figured it out yet; I will think about it again and must figure it out.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 崔万金反省包庇坏干部\n\n1948-02-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    崔万金反省包庇坏干部\n    （崔同志武安十区牛＠堡人，现年廿三岁，家庭赤贫，出身铁匠。一九四六年七月入党，四七年七月到区工作，现任十区武委会委员）。\n    我家六辈打铁为生。我九岁就打铁。我爷买了一亩八分坟地，九间房子。四二年卖房子，财主邻家用六百元强买走了（卖给别人得九百元）。盼八路军过来好报仇。八路军一来，我就当了武委会主任。那时村上的抗勤、书记、仓库主任等都是地主。平汉战役，干的有劲，光想报这股仇。但这一阶段，我的思想与地主沾染起了变化。心想当了干部，要弄个衣裳。又搞起破鞋来了。这个破鞋不是斗争户，可很有钱。啥也给做，鞋、衣裳。搞了几个月破鞋，九区政委来了个信，说我作风不好了。斗争这个女人，我心不同意，工作积极，掩护破鞋。杨风同同志来了一个信，说我如此下去没地位，好好干有地位。思想稍转变了点，后来工作好就入了党。\n    到安阳参加翻身队，我说可有了地位了。搞下老婆，六七天就参加翻身队。到安阳六区江村。区长过去是个看庙的，能力不大。我看不起他。有事他就和我商量，问我怎么办。我看起他看庙，这是忘本，看不起党。\n    我在岗头村工作，马学荣是村长，代理政治主任。他很不好。他弟当民兵。上级号召扩军时不能强迫，叫动员。群众动员他兄弟他不去。公安员和他是一家，他说：“谁动员他，他就跳井。”群众说：“要开除他扩兵组，坏蛋出去，兵就好扩了。”有一个人自动报名，并提出别人，这一下弄起来六个人。首先我先卡住武委会主任，结果弄出来几个。现在检讨那时没有作好，群众提出公安员坏，我答应解决，结果兵走了，我就不管了。公安员是党员，这些我都包庇了，这是忘本。\n    婚姻问题：有个十八岁的闺女，要解除婚约，我就给他离了婚，准备给我下边的干部结婚。我的用意是想落个好。\n    我这几天的思想：我很愿意学习，要开脑筋。结果一听报告，觉得自己的事说出来丢人、怕党不要。经过县委一谈，我想一定要说，将来一定要叫群众知道。不谈出来，谁也对不住。县委说：“你是个工人，动摇性从哪里来？”我还没想好，我再想一想，一定要想好。"

    "content": "[Taiyue News] Changzhuang is a natural village under the jurisdiction of Jiangjiazhuang village in the Second District of Tunliu. It has 23 households of poor peasants and hired laborers, totaling 69 people, accounting for 36% of the village's population; their land amounts to 217.5 mu, only accounting for 26% of the village's total land. The average landholding per person is 3.15 mu. There are 29 households of rich peasants and landlords, totaling 120 people (the method of class division may still have inaccuracies – Editor), owning 609.5 mu of land, with an average landholding of 6.007 mu per person. The average yield of coarse grains in this village is only around five dou per mu. In particular, poor peasants and hired laborers have little land and a weak foundation. They bear the same burdens and corvée labor as others, which is truly unbearable. For example, Chang Changzhu, a hired laborer, has a family of three and cultivates 11.5 mu of land. Last autumn, they harvested six shi and three dou of millet and five shi and two dou of corn, equivalent to five shi and three dou of rice. After paying one shi and six dou for burdens and three dou of wheat, they only had three shi and two dou of rice left, which is not enough for three people to eat for four months. Generally, the existing grain of poor peasants and hired laborers can only last until the end of the year, and at best until before the spring plowing, so most of them eat bran. Not only are the burdens heavy, but some of them have not received any fruits of the struggle. For example, Chang Haide only recently escaped from his life as a hired laborer but still has no house or land. During the struggle, Zhao Desheng and Huo Jinxi of this village shielded the landlords and oppressed the poor peasants and hired laborers. At a meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers, Huo Zihai said, \"I requested to join the peasant association, but people said that if I had a share of the burdens, I could not join. However, the landlord Chang Junming was struggled against, but his son still joined the peasant association and received the fruits of the struggle.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 常庄土地悬殊太大  地主比贫雇多一倍\n\n1948-02-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    常庄土地悬殊太大\n    地主比贫雇多一倍\n    【太岳消息】常庄是屯留二区姜家庄编村的一个自然庄，有雇贫农二十三户，六十九口人，占全村人口的百分之三十六；土地二百一十七亩半，仅占全村土地的百分之二十六。每人平均土地三亩一分五。富农、地主二十九户，一百二十口人（划阶级的方法可能还有不对头的地方——编者），土地六百零九亩五分，每人平均土地六亩零七厘。这村土地平均产杂粮每亩不过五斗上下，特别是雇贫农土地少，底子空，和别人一样的支差出负担，实在受不了。如雇贫常长住，家有三口人，种地十一亩半，去秋打下谷子六石三，玉茭五石二，共合米五石三，出了负担一石六斗，麦子三斗，净剩米三石二，不够三口人四个月的粮食。一般雇贫现有的粮食只能吃到年底，顶好的能吃到春耕前，所以大部吃糠。不光负担重，他们有的根本没有分到果实，如常海德今年才脱离了雇工生活，还是房无一间，地无一亩。在斗争时本村赵德胜、霍金喜等包庇地主，欺压雇贫。雇贫会上霍滋海说：“我要求参加农会，人家说有份儿负担分数，就不能参加。可是地主常俊明被斗了，他儿子还参加农会分果实。”"

Chiang Kai-shek dispatched military police to tightly surround the university, but the students ignored them. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely indignant, and students raised their fists and shouted slogans such as \"Strive for our democratic rights.\" When professors gave speeches condemning the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai and urged students to awaken the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to resist, the audience responded with applause. In student speeches, it was revealed that Peking University President Hu Shih's promise to investigate the truth about Chiang Kai-shek's arrest of five Peking University students was purely a \"blank check.\" They also denounced the president of Shanghai Tongji University as merely a \"tool\" of the Chiang government. Many cartoons posted at the meeting included one depicting Chiang Kai-shek's military police with hands full of blood, chasing students with American-made rifles. Students dressed up as public enemies Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Qun, Soong Tzu-wen, and Chiang Kai-shek's Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, wrapped in bandages, limping and reporting the Northeast defeat to Chiang Kai-shek in an ugly manner. On the same day, all university campuses were plastered with slogans protesting the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek in Shanghai. After the meeting, students from various universities conducted fundraising to comfort the injured students in Shanghai.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: Shanghai News: After the Shanghai Tongji University tragedy and the Shenxin Textile Factory massacre, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, terrified by the power of the people, are attempting to fabricate various conspiracies and excuses, and adopt bloody means to suppress the increasingly high tide of the anti-oppression struggle of Shanghai citizens. On the 3rd, the Chiang Kai-shek Songhu Garrison Command clamored to \"investigate the leaders of the Shenxin Textile Factory strike and sentence them to death or life imprisonment.\" Fascist executioners Yi Tiewu, Wu Guozhen, and others frantically clamored that in the future, all those participating in anti-oppression actions will be shot and \"killed on the spot without exception.\" Pan Gongzhan, speaker of the Chiang Kai-shek Shanghai Municipal Council, openly demanded that Shanghai be designated as a \"martial law zone\" to facilitate the unrestrained slaughter of the people of Shanghai. On the same day, after a meeting in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek appointed special agent chief Zheng Jiemin to Shanghai to make new arrangements for suppressing the people. In addition, to strengthen its reign of terror, the Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek authorities have recently formed a so-called Shanghai \"Public Security Promotion Committee\" and are hastily drafting men to expand the security team.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 支援上海同济大学反压迫运动  北平学生声讨蒋匪罪行\n\n1948-02-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    支援上海同济大学反压迫运动\n    北平学生声讨蒋匪罪行\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】北平消息：本月七日，平市学生三千余人（沪美联社报导为五千人），在北大校园举行示威大会，支援上海同济大学学生反压迫运动，及声讨蒋匪一手造成同济大学血案的罪行。蒋匪曾派遣军警将该校严密包围，学生毫未理睬。会场情绪异常愤激，学生们高举拳头呼喊“争取我们的民主权利”等口号。当教授们演说谴责上海蒋匪暴行，并敦促学生起来唤醒蒋区人民反抗时，全场响起一片掌声。学生发言中，揭露北大校长胡适答允调查蒋匪逮捕北大五学生真相，纯系“空头支票”。并痛斥上海同济大学校长只是蒋政府的御用“工具”。会场上张贴的许多漫画中，有一幅绘着满手血迹的蒋匪宪兵，拿着美制步枪追逐学生。学生们化装扮演人民公敌蒋介石、张群、宋子文，及蒋匪参谋长陈诚裹着绷带，一蹶一跛的向蒋介石报告东北败绩的丑态。各校校园同日均贴满抗议上海蒋匪暴行标语，会后各校学生进行募捐，慰劳上海受伤同学。\n    【新华社陕北九日电】上海消息：上海同济大学惨案与申新纱厂大血案发生后，蒋匪当局震慑于人民力量的强大，正妄图制造种种阴谋借口，采用血腥手段，以镇压日益高涨的上海市民反压迫斗争。三日，蒋匪淞沪警备司令部扬言要“清查申新纱厂罢工工人领袖，处以死刑或无期徒刑”。法西斯刽子手宜铁吾、吴国桢等，竟疯狂叫嚣今后对一切参加反压迫行动之群众，将开枪射击，“当场格杀勿论”。蒋匪上海参议会议长潘公展，则公开要求划上海为“戒严区”，以更便于放手屠杀上海人民。同日匪首蒋介石于南京召集会议后，即指派特务头子郑介民赴沪，作种种镇压人民的新的布置。此外，沪市蒋匪当局为加强其恐怖统治，近已组成所谓沪市“治安促进委员会”，并匆忙抓丁扩编保安队。"

He was transferred south this time but returned midway. After arriving home, he packed up his tools, shouldered his carrying pole, and went out. The villagers and village cadres suspect that he is no longer working. The village cadres asked the district, but the district said they couldn't figure it out, but he still had to be treated as a worker's family member. Once, the village assigned him a task, but his wife refused to do it. Li Yuming wrote a letter to the village chief saying, \"I'm still a cadre, why don't you care?\" This time when we arrived in Bailin, the villagers and village cadres were asking us, \"Is Li Yuming still working?\"\n    On the 27th, he came back and tried to sound us out. When we asked him, he said he was \"demobilized,\" and then said he was doing \"secret work.\" When asked about his leadership relations, he said \"in the county,\" and then said \"the county can't control it either,\" etc., he was very evasive.\n    Why are the masses inquiring about his background like this? The masses believe that he has abandoned his work, and at the same time, he has done many things that have let down the masses, for example: 1. He used to be very poor, but after becoming a cadre after the Anti-Japanese War, he became rich. Now he has mules at home; his house is bright (meaning good lacquered furniture, plastered walls), he eats well, raises sheep, has shepherds, and has farmhands. 2. He forcibly occupied the water cellar of the big landlord Liu Dezhi that the masses had confiscated. In Bailin, water is very scarce in the spring. He sealed his own water cellar and used other people's water. After using it up, he wouldn't let the masses use his water. If anyone went, he would kick the water bucket and scold them, still refusing to let them use it. ...\n    We believe that such a person, if he is a cadre, should also be educated by the department to which he belongs and let the masses deal with it. If he is not a cadre but pretends to be one, he should be brought to justice. Because the masses cannot figure it out, we are specially reporting it on their behalf, and ask the newspaper to answer this question for the masses. (Wang Peizhang)\n    Editor's Note: District cadres should not say \"can't figure it out\" and push it away. The district should be responsible for clarifying this matter and handling it in accordance with government regulations.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李玉明是不是工作干部  区上应该负责查个明白\n王裴璋\n1948-02-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    李玉明是不是工作干部\n    区上应该负责查个明白\n    编辑同志：\n    我们在前柏林村调查贷款情形时，据该村群众李聚富、刘日常、朱世昌、刘恩功等说，有这么一件事：\n    原来在阳邑当公安局派出所长的李玉明，是前柏林人，这次调他南下，中途回来了。到家后，收拾起张罗的工具，挑起担子就出外了。群众和村干部怀疑他已不做工作了，村干问区里，区里也说弄不清，但还得按工属待遇。一次村中派了他的差，他老婆不出，李玉明给村长写信说：“老子还是干部，你为什么不管？”这次我们到了柏林，群众村干在问我们：“李玉明是否还做工作？”\n    在二十七日，他回来了，找到我们那里探口气；我们问他，他说“复员了”，又说作“秘密工作”。问他领导关系，他说“在县里”，又说“县里也管不着”等等，支支吾吾的。\n    为什么群众这样打听他的根由呢？群众认为他是脱离了工作，同时他有不少对不住群众的事，举例如：一、他原来很穷，抗战后当了干部就富起来了，现在家里喂着骡子；家中明光光的（意思是好漆家具、棚粉的房子），吃的好，喂着羊，有放羊的，有长工。二、群众没收大地主刘得志的水窖他强占为己有了；柏林春天水很缺，他封住自己的水窖吃人家的，吃光后不让群众吃他的水，有人去就踢了水桶大骂一顿，还是不让吃。………\n    我们认为，象这样的人，如是干部，亦应由所属部门进行教育，并让群众来处理。如不是干部而冒充干部，更应法办。因群众无法弄清，特为代达，请报社给群众解答这一问题。（王裴璋）\n    编者按：区干部不应该说“弄不清”就推开不管，这件事区里应负责把它弄明白；按照政府条例办理。"

    "content": "From a Worker-Peasant Background, Returning to the Worker-Peasant Masses\n    Wang Qinglin's Self-Criticism on Serving the Landlords\n    One of the Self-Criticisms from the Taihang Sixth District Party Committee Rectification Meeting\n    (Comrade Wang is from Dahui Village, Wuan Sixth District, of poor peasant background, and a former hired laborer. He joined the Party in October 1938, and started working in the district in September 1945. He is currently an executive committee member of the Sixth District Party Committee.)\n\n    I've been out for four or five years. I went to work in Yangquan. Xie Laowen there is a feudal landlord. In the branch meeting, after discussion and struggle, I felt he should also be taken care of because he once sent my family thirty catties of white flour. I knew I had been tricked by the landlord, so I told Political Commissar Li. Political Commissar Li said to admit it to the masses and say I bought it from him with money. In my heart, I thought I ate half of his flour, and then give him money, I was not happy.\n\n    Village Chief Zhao Yongliang is from a rich peasant background and wormed his way into the Party. I was afraid the masses would struggle against him, so I asked him to donate two mu of land to the masses, so that he wouldn't be struggled against. This way the masses would welcome it, and he could still be the village chief. But at the time, the honest peasants were not satisfied. When I left the village, I asked Comrade Wang (village cadre) in the village to help me get a blanket, and he agreed.\n\n    I have relatives in the east slope of Miaoyu Village. I thought, this is my wife's family, just organize a struggle, but don't kick them out. So that people could say, \"It's still his brother-in-law who's in charge.\"\n\n    When I got to Kou Village, I struggled against Hao Yuzhen. Hao raised more than a hundred sheep and had ten mu of land. He was the manager of the cooperative. I lived in the cooperative. After I went to sleep, he woke me up to have soup and wine. He told me about his past poverty, saying that he had already been struggled against lightly in the first movement, and now people are moving again. I said, \"Don't be afraid, you can keep some.\" At the village struggle meeting, I expressed an opinion, saying, \"Hao Yuzhen can work for the benefit of the masses, look at how our cooperative makes more money than others.\" I said to let him keep a few sheep, don't touch the grain, keep some houses, and give him back a ram. Later, Hao said he benefited from my influence.\n\n    I went to work in Chenjiaping. Landlord Wen Xingbang raised forty or fifty sheep. When the district cadres went, they ate at his house. He told me that when he moved here, he was very poor and built himself up by herding sheep and farming. As he said this, he asked his family to make dumplings. I said no, and he said, \"What are you afraid of? You still have to help me in this struggle!\" I again followed his line, criticizing the village cadres at the meeting for preventing harm to \"middle peasant interests.\"\n\n    This autumn, I went back and told my wife, \"Our little donkey, if the landlord wants to borrow it, let's lend it to him if we don't need it, we have to unite with him.\" I felt sorry for the landlord, but I didn't feel sorry for the poor peasants. My family has two and a half mu of cotton, picked eighty or ninety catties of clean cotton, and sold twenty catties on credit to the landlord. I said it doesn't matter if you don't have money, give it whenever you have it. Upon self-examination, I am one with the landlord, and it will be terrible if this continues. I am truly from a hired laborer background. My second grandfather worked as a long-term laborer for others and couldn't go back in December because he fell into a ravine while chopping firewood for the landlord, and his body was never found. My grandfather was the same. I also worked as a long-term laborer for three years. But now I don't think about these things anymore, I have become detached from the poor and hired classes, and have developed hedonistic thoughts.

    "content": "To the Editor:\n\n    Ren Liansheng, a poor peasant in Mujing Village, She County, has a family of eight, including six children, the oldest only ten years old and the youngest only two months old. During the famine in the 31st year of the Republic [1942], they couldn't sustain themselves and fled to Zuoquan County. Last February, hearing that there was a movement for land reform at home, he wanted to turn things around, so he returned. After he came back, the cadres said, \"You came back late, the fruits have all been divided!\" and only allocated him seven mu and two fen of land. They didn't even have a house to live in, eight people with nothing, so they borrowed three dilapidated rooms from the vice chairman of the farmers' association. They had no grain at home, hoping that the harvest from the land would be good. But they encountered a bad year, and the harvested grain was not enough to eat. The entire family of six dared not eat a single thick meal, only drinking rice soup for more than a month until it was all gone. After that, he relied entirely on chopping firewood to buy some rice to sustain the family. He managed to earn enough for each day. Unfortunately, he later developed a sore on his neck and couldn't chop firewood, so the whole family was going hungry. He lay on the kang [heated brick bed] and thought about it, but couldn't find a solution. He heard that the village had a public granary, so he went to the village cadre to borrow from it. The chairman of the farmers' association said, \"The procedures for the public granary haven't been sorted out yet, wait a few days!\" He went seven times, but couldn't borrow anything. Just then, his wife gave birth to twins. The adults couldn't get a full meal, so how could the children have milk to drink? Eight people had two tattered quilts, no mattress, and the children had no clothes to wear, shivering and crying on the kang. His wife was also crying. As the end of the year approached, he owed more than three thousand yuan for medicine he had taken at the political director's and the demobilized soldiers' pharmacy when he was sick. They came every day to demand payment, and he couldn't pay. The bill collectors glared at him and shouted, \"We are not a relief center, if you don't have money, go borrow somewhere else, you have to pay the bill anyway.\" He was forced into a corner. After we learned about this, we went to ask Ren Liansheng, \"The pharmacy belongs to the political director, why don't you talk to the political director!\" He said, \"I don't dare!\" Like this, day by day, the New Year was approaching. Others were butchering meat and grinding flour, but he didn't even know where to borrow the rice he used to make rice soup. One night, he discussed with his wife that he wanted to give a daughter away to someone else in exchange for a few kilograms of rice to get through the New Year. His wife couldn't bear to, so they argued all night. At dawn, his wife ran to the countryside and cried, saying, \"Who is as miserable as us! Living in someone else's house, afraid of being gossiped about. Others have rice and flour for the New Year, but we can't even borrow food! I have nowhere to say the bitterness in my heart all year round, alas!\" After we learned about this, we persuaded her to come back. From this incident, we can see that poor and hired peasants are selling their children for the New Year, but some rich peasants are still buying meat for the New Year and still living in good courtyards. We believe that land reform is not thorough, and the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants should be resolved quickly. Therefore, we are writing to your newspaper to publish this, so that not only this village should pay attention, but also all localities must check the current difficulties of the poor and hired peasants.

    "content": "[This newspaper's report] According to preliminary investigations by work personnel in Shidong Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, the thoroughness of the emancipation of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this village is still insufficient; cadres take too much of the fruits of labor and oppress the masses severely; some former landlords are even serving as cadres and are being protected by the village cadres from being struggled against.\n\nMost of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this village make a living by cultivating mountain land and working as carpenters. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the upper-level figures of the Duan family, such as Duan Bingnan (former political director, recently dismissed because the masses considered him a feudal rich peasant), Duan Laiyou (chairman of the peasant association), Duan Yonghe (former village chief), etc., took turns controlling the village government. Poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and carpenters were suppressed by them, and they did not receive many fruits of land reform. According to a survey of 32 poor and lower-middle peasant households, the fruit points of 26 of them were below six. Xiao San, who had been cultivating mountain land outside and just returned, was only given two points. Zhang Wenbin (family member of a soldier), the manager of the cooperative, who the masses used to consider a feudal rich peasant, was given twelve points. In terms of land quality, the land of the poor and lower-middle peasants could not compare with that of the cadres; even in quantity, it was about the same. (This village has a total of 22 hectares of land, more than 230 households, and more than 700 people, with an average of more than three mu of land per person.) Now some poor peasants will soon have no food to eat. For example, Tu Jin had only two dou of corn and more than 30 jin of rice left before the new year, and still owed 42 jin of wheat (borrowed some to pay public grain) and 76 jin of rice.\n\nRegarding the situation of the cadres, poor peasant Ying Huiniang said: Shidong is a \"Ten-Household Democracy.\" That is to say, only a few main cadres in the whole village are in charge, monopolizing affairs and acting recklessly. Duan Bingnan occupied three mu of land belonging to the poor peasant Duan Yonglin, and only returned it after he was dismissed, and even then he returned it to the peasant association. Duan Bingnan also occupied the house of the poor peasant Duan Xianghua, forcing Duan Xianghua to cry all night before he reluctantly moved. The village cadres stipulated that old bachelors and old widows would not be taken care of unless they were family members of soldiers. The reason was that they would not live for many more years, so who would they leave the distributed items to if they were given too much? For craftsmen, no matter whether they could maintain their family life, they were given fewer points. The cadres, however, wanted to be given more points, arguing that they were delaying their work by handling official affairs. As a result, cadres taking more fruits of labor and stealing fruits of labor became very serious. In order to oppose cadres taking too much of the fruits of labor, some poor peasants suffered heavy blows from the cadres. Duan Chunlin (poor peasant), a demobilized soldier, raised objections at the meeting of family members of soldiers because he saw that the distribution of fruits of labor was unfair. As a result, the village cadres deprived him of his right to speak for two months and also revoked the ten points of fruit he had originally received. Later, after the district cadres raised objections, he was given seven points back. The village cadres gave Ying Huiniang two points, which she thought was too little. Zhang Xixiu, a member of the peasant association, said: \"You think it's too little! [a vulgar expression]!\" The village cadres simply did not give her any. Later, others persuaded them to give her one point. Afterwards, when distributing fruits of labor, they demoted her to the fifth class. The masses said: \"Give as much as you give, if you raise objections, you won't even have this little bit of fruit.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石洞村是“十家民主”  干部一窝蜂报复群众  贫雇动不动就被取消说话权\n\n1948-02-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    石洞村是“十家民主”\n    干部一窝蜂报复群众\n    贫雇动不动就被取消说话权\n    【本报消息】武安九区石洞村的工作员，经过初步调查，了解到这村贫雇的翻身还相当不彻底；干部多占果实，对群众压制的很厉害；有的老财还当着干部，被村干部包庇着没斗。\n    这村的贫雇，多半靠种山地、做木工过时光。抗战以后，段家的上层人物，比方段炳南（过去群众认为他是封建富农，才撤职不久的政治主任）、段来有（农会主任）、段永和（过去的村长）等，轮流掌握村政权。贫雇、木工被他们压制着，土地改革当中，没有得到多少果实。根据三十二户贫雇的调查，里面有二十六户的果实分数都在六分以下。小三在外面种山地才回来，只给评了两分。合作社经理张文斌（抗属），群众过去认为他是封建富农，却评了十二分。在土地质量上，贫雇的地，没法和干部比；就是数量上还差不多。（这村共有二十二顷地，二百三十多户，七百来口人，每人平均三亩多地。）现在有的贫雇马上就没有粮食吃。象土金，年前只剩下二斗玉茭，三十多斤米，还欠人家四十二斤麦子（缴公粮借了一些），七十六斤米。\n    提到干部情况，贫农英会娘说：石洞是“十家民主”。就是说，全村只有几个主要干部当家包办胡作乱为。段炳南霸占了贫农段永林的三亩地，直到他被撤职才退出来，又是退给了农会。段炳南还霸占了贫农段祥华的房子。逼的段祥华哭了一夜，才无可奈何的搬了家。村干部规定老光棍、老寡妇如果不是抗属就不照顾。理由是他们活不了几年，多分了东西留给谁？对手艺人，不管他能不能维持家庭生活，都是少定分。干部们却要多定分，理由是他们办工作误了工。这样干部多占果实，偷盗果实就很严重。为了反对干部多占果实，有的贫农受了干部很重的打击。退伍军人段春林（贫农）看到果实分配不公，在抗属会上提意见。结果叫村干部取消了他两个月的发言权，还把他原来得的十分果实撤回去。后来区干部提了意见，才又补给他七分。村干部给英会娘定了两分，她嫌少。农会委员张西秀说：“嫌少！下他个吉巴的！”村干部干脆不给她了。后来别人劝说着才给了一分。以后分果实，就把她降到五等一级。群众说：“给多少算多少，要是提意见，就连这点果实也没有了。”"

According to a Shanghai dispatch from the American News Agency on the 4th of this month, citing a protest letter from Ahmaedjan Qasimi and others to Zhang Zhizhong, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to implement a policy of terror and suppression in Xinjiang Province, has violated the 1946 agreement and greatly increased troops from 20,000 in the past to 80,000. This not only increased the burden on the people, but also \"threatened Muslim masses and Muslim representatives at all levels of government, creating terror, indiscriminately arresting people, and subjecting them to torture and slaughter.\" Chiang Kai-shek also broke the agreement to abolish secret agents, instructing his Sanqing Tuan (Three Principles of the People Youth League) secret agents to wantonly arrest and kill people.\n\nAccording to a confession from a Chiang Kai-shek CC Clique magazine in Shanghai, after Chiang Kai-shek appointed the reactionary feudal element Masud Sabri as the chairman of Xinjiang Province last May, \"the political lineup in Dihua was immediately 'adjusted' by Masud Sabri and Isa Yusuf Alptekin (Secretary-General of Chiang Kai-shek's Xinjiang Provincial Government).\" The Uyghur version of the Xinjiang Daily was also forcibly \"taken over\" by Isa Yusuf Alptekin and others. By means of disguised \"popular elections,\" democratic figures in various prefectural and county governments were \"cleared out.\" The \"re-elections\" of provincial and county councilors and county heads directed by Wu Mair, the commissioner of the Kashgar District in southern Xinjiang, and the sham elections in Dihua, Maralbexi, Aksu and other districts were all to achieve this goal. The magazine confessed: \"In the mainland (other Chiang-controlled areas), there is no 'people' to speak of in popular elections, let alone in Xinjiang.\" After Masud Sabri seized power, corruption became even worse, and new currency was issued indiscriminately, causing prices to soar.

He joined the Party in October 1939, came to the district to work in March 1946, and is now working in the Third District Party Work Team.)\n\n    When I was a hired hand, I had a relationship with the landlord's daughter. After liberation, when I was a cadre, I wanted to marry this daughter, but my relatives opposed it, but the daughter was willing. After we got married, the relatives gave us good food. I said, \"Let's eat it!\" I didn't know this was the landlord's bribery. Chen Youyi said I was getting slick, that now I had a wife, I wouldn't work hard. I said I was willing to serve the masses, but I didn't agree with his view in my heart. Later, when I was political director, I was going to be transferred out of the area after only a few days. I thought: \"Look at this higher-up, knowing it's wrong not to go out, but going out means immediately leaving my wife.\" The higher-up said I wouldn't leave the district, so I became a district cadre in Wuhe Township. I wanted to build a kiln, and after telling the cadres, I used stonemasons to get stones and had the masses carry the stones, using two hundred workdays for the two kilns. I thought I had merit, but in reality, I exploited the masses.\n\n    When I was chairman of the Peasant Association, I took the cadre route, distributing seventy catties of wheat to each person for the New Year. I said I didn't want it. But I didn't refuse, and it was sent home.\n\n    I suggested getting a mule. It died a few days later. Then I suggested getting an ox, and then we swapped it for another mule. After that, the cadres all wanted to feed mules.\n\n    The branch secretary changed three wives, and the militia director changed one. This was us covering up for each other.\n\n    Once, when carrying a stretcher, more than ten households were unwilling to go. The masses said, \"The cadres have mules but don't go, and we don't have food, how can we go?\" I said, \"You're dead backward, there's a problem,\" and detained them. I thought: \"If we implement democracy, how can we not get contributions?\"\n\n    It was even worse when I suppressed the masses during conscription. The masses said, \"Conscription is us, carrying stretchers is also us.\" I detained them. When I got to the district, I even said that my village was volunteering. When I got back, I wanted to eat noodles and had the masses cultivate the land for me. The masses said, \"Don't look for a good wife, you won't be able to keep a good wife.\" The past work can't be exposed.\n\n    During the return of the fruits of struggle, the masses criticized Hu Daxiang for building the kiln incorrectly and for feeding the mules incorrectly.

Chiang Kai-shek's China and Central Aviation Companies have announced that, starting from the 7th, ticket prices on all routes will increase by 30 to 40 percent. According to financial circles in Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek's massive issuance of 5,000-denomination Customs Gold Unit notes (equivalent to 100,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency) during the Lunar New Year is one of the reasons for this price surge. It is estimated that more economic unrest will occur in the next half month.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-14",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 11th: News from Chiang-controlled newspapers: The Chiang-Soong bureaucratic capital is colluding with American imperialism to actively monopolize South China's industry, mining, and trade. The Guangdong Provincial Industrial Company, which monopolizes the economy of Guangdong Province, has been accepted by the bandit Soong Tzu-wen. This company includes 187 factories, including the Shunde Sugar Factory, which earns 10 billion Chiang currency annually. Ge Jingzhong, the general manager of the Soong bandit China Sericulture Company, has been dispatched to Guangzhou to monopolize the province's silk industry. The Soong bandit China Construction Bank will soon establish a branch in Guangzhou to engage in the sugar and textile industries. The Soong bandit plans to transfer the textile and sugar factories originally operated by the Guangdong Provincial Industrial Company to this company. The Soong bandit-controlled Guangdong cement industry has already monopolized the South China cement market. Huang Xuchu, the Chiang bandit chairman of Guangxi Province, was also forced to open Guangxi, allowing Chiang-Soong bureaucratic capital to massively invade Guangxi's leather, sugar, cement, sulfuric acid, textile, iron, and paper industries, as well as the coal mines in Qianjiang and other places. The Chiang-Soong clique is also making every effort to expand the market for American goods in South China and monopolize South China's import and export trade. The original Guangzhou office of the Chiang bandit Import and Export Management Committee has now been expanded into the South China Branch of the Import and Export Management Committee. For example, South China's import quota for the third quarter of last year was 1,430,466 US dollars, an increase of 173,543 US dollars compared to the second quarter. At the same time, all import and export merchants in Guangzhou were forced to re-register. Of the more than 2,000 import and export merchants who applied for registration, only 14 tons of imported goods were approved, with the rest being monopolized by the Chiang-Soong clique. A large number of smuggled goods also openly enter South China under the protection of the Chiang-Soong and other bureaucratic capital. It is generally estimated that the total value of smuggled imports is about four to five times the value of goods taxed by the Guangdong Customs. Recently, Hong Kong also discovered an incident of Chiang bandit officials selling import permits, totaling as much as 1.5 million US dollars.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: A large number of factories and shops in Yantai have closed down due to the Chiang bandit's exorbitant taxes and cruel destruction. Of the more than 180 shops on Beida Street in Yantai, more than 30 have closed down, and 59 have posted notices saying \"Shop for Sale.\" The famous Fuxing Iron Factory has also fallen into a state of shutdown. Two sock factories on Dong Taiping Street closed down because they could not afford the 2,500 jin of corn heavy tax forcibly levied by the Chiang bandits. The Yuliu Bank and Chaoyang and Haitong Banks on Beida Street were even sealed off by the Chiang bandit municipal party headquarters and naval headquarters under the pretext of \"Communist Party\" suspicion. Many shops have been converted into small stalls due to excessive losses, but small stall vendors still cannot escape the Chiang bandits' extortion. On the 26th of last month, the coastal defense camp forcibly extracted 40% of the \"conscription donation\" from the stall vendors who went to the market after an on-the-spot valuation.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 10th: According to a magazine in the Chiang-controlled area: There were more than 200 silk stocking factories in Shanghai two years ago, but recently, due to American nylon stockings taking away more than two-thirds of the market, only 53 remain. Tin foil factories used for packaging cigarettes have also been invaded by American aluminum foil, and now there are only 18. The total monthly output of each factory is about 10,000 boxes. According to the Shanghai Tin Foil Industry's import statistics for the first eight months of last year, the cost of American aluminum foil (steel essence) consumed by each cigarette factory has reached 800 billion Chiang currency.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: According to foreign news agency reports from Shanghai: Taking advantage of the Chinese New Year, when private industrial and commercial families had difficulty in capital turnover, the four major families' banks stopped all loans on the one hand and bought up factory and shop inventories at low prices on the other, in order to hoard and speculate and sell at high prices. The Chiang bandit's Joint Treasury purchased up to 150 batches, worth 150 billion Chiang currency. Due to the shrinking purchasing power of citizens and the need for shop owners to repay debts, the prices of some commodities generally decreased by 10% on New Year's Eve, but business was worse than on the Gregorian New Year's Eve. At the same time, rice, which is most needed by the general public, has risen sharply.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 8th: According to Chiang-controlled newspapers: The four major families' monopoly capital is actively expanding to the Northwest. The Chiang bandit Northwest Minsheng Industrial Company has been officially relocated to Nanjing and has established branches in Shanghai, Lanzhou, and Dihua, owning 100 cars. The company's business plan includes four major sectors: agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, completely monopolizing the Northwest economy. Provincial-level monopoly institutions under the four major families' monopoly system are also actively operating. The Lanzhou Chiang bandit authorities will soon establish a \"Production and Construction Company,\" whose main business is to engage in industrial and commercial monopoly activities. In addition, the \"Gansu Transportation Company,\" which controls all transportation companies in the Northwest, was also officially established before the New Year.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 8th: The Chiang bandit's shipping monopoly organization \"China Merchants Steam Navigation Company\" has again joined forces with China Navigation Company, Central China Shipping Company, and Yixiang Steamship Company to organize an \"Overseas Shipping Joint Business Office\" in order to expand its monopoly scope. The person in charge of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also serves as the director of the office, monopolizing all overseas import and export trade shipping. Its business scope also stipulates that it can sign overseas transportation contracts, agency contracts, and charter contracts with Chinese and foreign material organizations, shipping companies, and other transportation institutions.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: Various sources: The Chiang bandit traitorous government is taking various steps to strengthen and monopolize trade with Japan. The Chiang bandit Central Bank has prepared to establish a branch in Tokyo and stipulates that its central business is to serve the dumping of Japanese goods into China under the direct command of the US military headquarters and to \"supervise\" the \"commercial institutions\" that the Chiang bandit allowed to be established in Japan. Air and sea transportation between Chiang and Japan has also been strengthened simultaneously. The Chiang bandit China National Aviation Corporation and the \"US Military Headquarters\" stationed in Japan have reached an oral agreement on the Chiang-Japan air traffic problem after half a year of negotiations. The person in charge of the company will soon go to Japan to formally complete the route agreement. The Chiang bandit water transport monopoly organization China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent people to Japan as early as December last year to prepare for the establishment of an office.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋宋官僚资本与美帝勾结  垄断华南工矿贸易\n\n1948-02-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    蒋宋官僚资本与美帝勾结\n    垄断华南工矿贸易\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合蒋区报刊消息：蒋宋官僚资本与美帝勾结积极垄断华南工、矿贸易。垄断粤省经济的广东省实业公司，已为宋匪子文接受，该公司包括一百八十七座工厂，每年盈利蒋币一百亿元的顺德糖厂亦在内。宋匪中蚕公司总经理葛敬中，已奉派到广州垄断全省蚕丝业。宋匪中国建设银公司，行将在广州设立分公司，经营糖与纺织工业。宋匪并拟将原属广东省实业公司经营的纺织厂及糖厂，移交该公司经营。宋匪操纵之粤省洋灰工业，已垄断华南洋灰市场。桂省蒋匪主席黄旭初，也被迫开放广西，让蒋、宋官僚资本大规模侵入广西皮革、糖、详灰、硫酸、纺织、铁工、造纸等七种工业，以及开采迁江等地的煤矿。蒋宋并竭力在华南为美货扩大市场，并垄断华南的进出口贸易，原来的蒋匪输出入管理委员会广州办事处，现已扩大为输管会华南分会，如华南去年第三季进口限额为一、四三○、四六六美元，较第二季增加一七三、五四三美元。同时逼令广州所有进出口商重行登记，已申请登记的二千余进出口商，仅核准进口货十四吨强，其余尽为蒋、宋所垄断。大量的走私货物，也在蒋、宋等官僚资本庇护下公开进入华南。据一般估计，走私进口货总值，在粤海关报税货物四倍至五倍左右。最近香港还发现蒋匪官僚卖输入特许证事件，总额达一百五十万美元之巨。\n    【新华社陕北十二日电】蒋匪横征暴敛残酷摧残下的烟台工厂、商号大批倒闭。烟市北大街一百八十余商号，已有三十余家倒闭，五十九家贴出“铺面出兑”的招贴。有名的复兴铁工厂也已陷入歇业状态。东太平街有两家织袜厂均因缴不起蒋匪强征的二千五百斤包米重税而倒闭。北大街的裕留银号和朝阳、海通银号，更被蒋匪市党部、海军司令部横加“共党”嫌疑名义查封。许多商号因亏累过甚而改为小摊贩，但小摊贩依然摆脱不掉蒋匪的敲榨勒索。上月二十六日海防营赶集摊贩，竟被当场估价强抽百分之四十的“壮丁捐”。\n    【新华社陕北十日电】据蒋区杂志载：沪市丝袜业工厂前年尚有二百余家，近因美货尼龙丝袜夺去三分之二以上市场，仅存五十三家。包装卷烟用之锡纸厂亦因市场为美造铝纸所侵夺，现仅有十八家，各厂每月产量合计约一万箱左右，而据沪锡纸业按照去年八个月进口统计，各烟厂所耗美货铝纸（钢精）代价，则已达蒋币八千亿元之巨。\n    【新华社陕北十二日电】据外国通讯社上海消息：四大家族各银行乘旧历年关，民间工商业家资金周转不灵之际，一面停止一切贷款，一面贱价收买工厂商店存货，以便囤积居奇，高价抛售，蒋匪四联总处买进达一百五十批，值蒋币一千五百亿元。由于市民购买力萎缩，店主需款还债，若干商品除夕价格普遍降低百分之十，但生意比阳历除夕还坏。同时，广大市民最需要的大米，则急剧上涨。\n    【新华社陕北八日电】据蒋区报纸消息：四大家族垄断资本积极向西北扩张，蒋匪西北民生实业公司已正式改设于南京，并于上海、兰州、迪化三地设分公司，自拥汽车一百辆。该公司业务计划包括农工矿商四大部门，全盘垄断西北经济的。四大家族垄断系统下之省级垄断机构亦积极活动，兰州蒋匪当局即将成立“生产建设公司”，该公司主要业务为从事工商业之垄断活动。又控制西北全部交通运输公司的“甘肃运输动公司”，亦于年前正式成立。\n    【新华社陕北八日电】蒋匪水运垄断组织“招商局”为扩大其垄断范围，顷又与中国航运公司、中央轮船公司及益祥轮船公司等联合组织“海外航务联合营业处”，由招商局负责人兼任该处处长，垄断海外一切进出口贸易航运。其业务范围中并规定可与中外物资机关、轮船公司及其他运输机构签订海外运输合约、代理契约以及租船契约等。\n    【新华社陕北九日电】各方消息：蒋匪卖国政府正采取各种步骤加强与垄断对日贸易。蒋匪中央银行已准备在东京设立分行，并规定其中心业务乃在美军总部直接指挥下，为日货对华倾销服务，并对蒋匪所允在日设立的“商业机关”施以“监督”。蒋日间海空运输也已同时加强，蒋匪中国航空公司与驻日“美军统帅部”谈判半年之蒋日通航问题，已于上月底达成口头协定，该公司负责人即将赴日正式完成航线协定。蒋匪水运垄断组织招商局，则早于去年十二月即派人赴日筹设办事处。"

    "content": "West Lake Model Village\nPoor Peasants and Hired Laborers Starve During the New Year\nCorrespondent's Letter\n\nEditor:\n\nFrom the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month, I went to West Lake Village in the second district of Wu'an to promote the Outline Land Law, and returned on the 28th. In these four days, because I was unfamiliar with both the people and the place, I superficially learned about the serious grievances and sufferings among the hired and poor peasants. These things were personally told to me by the hired and poor peasants in their homes.\n\nWest Lake Village has three hundred households and is a key central village (according to the village cadres). In the past, it was a model village in the second district. During the production movement, it once engaged in competitions and challenges with other villages. Based on the materials I obtained, there are many problems in this model village.\n\nWest Lake Village has a Guo Shulong, who is forty-eight years old. At the age of sixteen, he started working as a long-term laborer for landlords and rich peasants. He has been a \"long-term laborer\" for thirty years until after liberation in 1945. Now he is still a bachelor, wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket from four years ago that barely covers his body. He said that during the fruit distribution, the cadres wanted to give him a foreign cloth gown, but how could he wear that to pick manure and chop firewood? Because he didn't want it, it was simply dropped. Song Lao Si has been begging for three generations. When he was a teenager, he ran far away, begging for food and carrying a broken pot. While telling his story, he pointed to his eldest child's tattered jacket, saying that if it weren't for the broken cloth shirt with a large collar underneath, his belly would be exposed. When they talked about being expelled from the Farmers' Association by the village chief, their eyes filled with tears. Song Lao Si said: \"We were expelled by the village chief together on the evening of March 29th this year, and we were detained for a whole night. That night, I saw people going to the toilet in the yard. I thought it was too crowded, so I urinated outside the door, and they said I was disrupting the meeting. That night, the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association taught us to make false confessions. He told me to learn from him. He said that if we didn't admit it, the village chief would smash us to pieces.\" (Meaning to kill). So they admitted their mistakes. The next day, they were released. Although they were no longer detained, I was so angry that I was crazy for ten days.\n\nThen he continued: \"We have nothing to wear, and people say we are being careful. We really have nothing, what can we do? We got a little over ten points during the fruit distribution, which is neither too much nor too little. When the fruit accounts were read that day, I heard the cadres borrowing 30,000 here and 50,000 there. The director of the armed committee borrowed 70,000 or 80,000 to marry his wife, who cares about us!\" Around the lunar New Year, it was discovered that eleven households of hired and poor peasants had nothing to eat and were about to have their pots taken away. Zhang Lao San was going to beg for food because he had nothing to eat. Zhang Heyi is a tenant farmer who is a bachelor because he is poor. In the past, he had one mu of his own land. In addition to renting land, he often did odd jobs to make a living. Last year, he was allocated fruit. He planted two mu of millet, which grew very well, but was eaten by insects and only yielded one stone and two dou. Because he had nothing to eat in the spring and summer, he borrowed grain and had to return six dou and five sheng in the autumn. He paid 69 jin and 2 liang of public grain rice and over 100 jin of millet for labor (including mutual aid and supporting the government). When he was forced by public grain, Zhao, the political commissar of the second district, lent him 3,000 yuan while working in the village. In the days near the lunar New Year, he was worried to death. He said that times are hard now. Begging for food is no longer popular. Doing odd jobs has fewer opportunities. Chopping firewood requires capital, and there will be nothing to eat in the autumn. Except for a few times of production, he has been begging for food ever since. There is also an orphan named Wang Youde, whose parents died early. He started begging for food at the age of five or six and slept in the Guandi Temple. He is fourteen years old this year. After the emancipation movement, he still has no house or land. The poor are suffering so much, but some of the targets of struggle still have means. Wang Rende's family ground white flour for a whole day during the New Year, at least three large dou of wheat.

The so-called \"new strategy\" of Wei Lihuang after taking office in the Northeast, according to Reuters, is to establish a \"solid defense line\" of more than thirty miles long north of Tieling, and attempt to resist our army's movement from Xifeng and Meihekou towards Shenyang. Therefore, the Central News Agency hastily fabricated the so-called \"victory\" of \"recovering Dongfeng and Xifeng.\" However, before the plan was completed, it was hit hard by our army at Xinlitun, the gateway to Shenyang in the west. Then he clamored to \"recover Xinlitun with all his strength.\" Unexpectedly, before the cry ceased, Liaoyang was lost again, and tens of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits were annihilated. In this situation of overall passivity and being beaten everywhere, how can they know where to cope next? This is the most distressing problem for Wei Lihuang at present. Secondly, our army's capture of Liaoyang, as the \"main southern stronghold of the Shenyang defense system,\" not only opened a gap in the enemy's satellite stronghold line south of Shenyang, isolating the enemy's isolated strongholds of Anshan and Yingkou along the southern section of the China Changchun Railway far behind; but also, in the future, in isolated, besieged, or city-attacking operations, our army will be able to concentrate its forces more freely, gallop east and west, and annihilate the enemy to a greater extent. This is another problem that Wei Lihuang is thinking about day and night and feeling more distressed about. These are the actual impacts of the Liaoyang victory on Chiang Kai-shek's camp.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of military technology and enemy morale, it can also be seen that: The capture of Liaoyang has once again tempered our army's siege capabilities. From the capture of Zhangwu to the capture of Liaoyang, our army, with close cooperation between infantry and artillery, spent less than ten hours in total for the three city attacks, and captured cities defended by entire enemy divisions with very few casualties. Liaoyang, which is known as \"Liaoyang of iron, Shenyang of paper,\" is enough to show the gradual improvement of our army's siege technology and the invincible courage. On the contrary, on the enemy's side, since the great annihilation battle of Gongzhutun, they would rather sit idly by and watch their entire isolated and besieged friendly forces being annihilated, and dare not send a single soldier to support them. Therefore, as soon as the bandit army suffers casualties, they lay down their weapons in batches. These new changes in the Liaoyang campaign will continue to appear in the future. This is a major factor in the development of the war situation that Chiang Kai-shek cannot stop.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 评辽阳之捷  我军攻坚技术更加提高  蒋匪全局被动没法招架\n\n1948-02-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    评辽阳之捷\n    我军攻坚技术更加提高\n    蒋匪全局被动没法招架\n    【新华社东北十二日电】分社记者评辽阳之捷称：东北解放军在第三次攻城战中夺下辽阳，不到五十天内共歼敌五个整师，（零星歼敌的四个整团等尚不在内）。这是对刚刚上台的匪首卫立煌一个迎头痛击。卫匪出马东北以后的所谓“新战略”，据路透社透露就是在铁岭以北建立长达三十余里的“坚固防线”，并企图抗拒我军从西丰、梅河口向沈阳的移动，因此中央社就急情的捏造所谓“收复东丰、西丰”的“胜利”。但是计划未完，就遭我军在沈西门户新立屯的重重一击，于是他又叫嚣起“全力收复新立屯”来。不料叫声未息，又失辽阳，蒋匪成万被歼。在这种全局被动处处挨打的情况下，他们哪能知道下一着又该从哪里招架呢？这就是卫匪目前最感苦恼的问题。其次我军攻克了作为“沈阳防卫体系南部主力点”的辽阳，不仅在敌巢沈阳南面的卫星据点线上打开了一个缺口，把中长路南段的匪军孤立据点鞍山、营口远远的抛在后面；而且今后在孤立、围困或是攻城的作战中，我军已更能自由集中兵力，驰骋东西，予敌军以更大歼灭。这又是卫匪立煌昼夜焦思、感到更大苦恼的另一个问题，这些就是辽阳大捷给予蒋匪营垒的实际影响。\n    再从军事技术和敌我士气来说，也可以看出：辽阳的攻克，又一次的锻炼了我军的攻坚能力。从彰武到辽阳的攻克，我军在步炮密切配合之下，三次的攻城一共只费了不到十小时的时间，并以很小的伤亡就夺取了整师敌军防守的城市，而辽阳则是以“铁打的辽阳、纸糊的沈阳”著称的，这就足见我军攻坚技术的逐步提高，和无坚不摧的无上勇气。相反的，在敌军方面，则自公主屯的一次大歼灭战后，他们宁可坐视其整师孤立被围的友军被歼，不敢派出一兵一卒应援，因此匪军一有伤亡就成批放下武器。辽阳战役中这些新的变化，今后还会继续出现。这是蒋匪所无法遏止的一个战局发展的重大因素。"

According to the current investigation, the poor and hired peasants have five demands. First, to clear the accounts of the cooperative. How much of the fruits of struggle (including grain, timber, cotton, and furniture) placed in the cooperative is actually there? How much money has the cooperative actually earned? Second, to clear up the fruits of struggle. Originally, the three rooms of the Farmers' Association Director Duan Laiyou's house were filled with the fruits of struggle; but now only a little is left, and it is all bad. When village cadres moved the fruits of struggle, the militia stood guard, not allowing the masses to go out, saying it was \"martial law.\" Third, to cleanse the old rich from the cooperative. Fourth, cadres should return the excessively occupied fruits [of struggle]. Fifth, to demand to be the masters [of their own affairs]. Poor peasant Duan Tingyu said: \"Not daring to speak is a big deal, retaliation follows if you offer an opinion.\" Veteran Duan Zhuhua said: \"We must transfer cadres and hand over power to the poor.

My husband is called Gao Laoxun, and he is 58 years old this year. Since he was a child, he has been a hired laborer. For the first thirty years, he worked as a hired laborer in Licun, working there for thirty years. After the Japanese came, my Xiaolian (her son) was only a teenager. He also came to Licun to herd sheep for the landlord. In 1934, when my Xiaolian was nineteen years old, he went to Macun to herd sheep for Ren Laoting (landlord). The sheep owner falsely accused my child of shearing his sheep's wool, threatened him with a knife, and insisted on sending him to the garrison. My Xiaolian was so scared that he jumped into a well and died. Speaking of this, she raised her head, as if thinking about the past again, with tears in her eyes. She continued: \"Don't mention it. His father was honest and couldn't afford to offend people. He wrapped him in a mat and buried him in a broken kiln pit east of Licun Village. I cried for several days, until my eyes were blind from crying.\" After the Japanese devils were defeated, my old man no longer worked as a hired laborer. He joined the peasant association and planned to turn over a new leaf here. Last year, he only received five mu of land, and he had no livestock or furniture. This year, the old man was sick for half a year, and because there was no furniture, the land was also barren. The village cadres took the land back, and there was no food to eat at home. This year, I have been grinding flour for people, earning one or two bran wotou a day. I eat one and take one back for the old man to eat. If there is no one to grind flour, I can't earn anything and I have to go hungry. My old man was sick for half a year, and sometimes he couldn't even eat bran wotou. This autumn, he died of illness and starvation. After his death, we couldn't afford a coffin. He was carried naked to the broken kiln pit and buried with my Xiaolian, his father and son together. He was buried very shallowly, and the dogs ate his corpse. His white bones are still lying outside.\" She paused, tears falling from her eyes. She raised her gray and tattered cotton-padded sleeve to her eyes and wiped them. Then, very sadly, she said, \"I have no money to buy cotton to spin, so I have to beg for food, asking people for some chaff, vegetables, and bean dregs, or steamed wotou with vegetables.\" She picked up a wotou made of bean dregs mixed with chaff, with no grain at all, and said, \"A few days ago, the village cadres held a meeting at the people's school and said: The higher authorities have ordered us not to allow begging anymore, and said they want to drive me out of the village!

    "content": "Yangcheng Xiguan Farmers' Association Chairman\n    Oppresses Poor Peasant Li Kongji\n\n    The chairman of the Yangcheng Xiguan Farmers' Association oppresses employed and poor peasant Li Kongji. For two years, Li Kongji swallowed his bitterness, and only today dares to speak out. Li Kongji is already sixty-eight years old this year, and has spent his life doing odd jobs and living in landlords' homes, and has been continuously oppressed by the chairman of the Farmers' Association. The major incidents are these: He and the village Farmers' Association Vice Chairman Song Chunyong live in the same courtyard and are nominally in the same mutual aid group. Once, Li Kongji finally exchanged labor to get Song Chunyong's ox labor to plow the land. After plowing for only half a day, when he returned for lunch, Song Chunyong started cursing: \"Damn it, it's not your ox, so you don't care about it. You plowed four mu of land in half a day, you're killing my ox!\" Li Kongji said: \"You are also a working person, how can you plow four mu of land in half a day? It's obviously only plowed more than one mu, and you say four mu.\" Song Chunyong immediately became furious and cursed, \"You are farting and talking nonsense!\" and raised his hand to strike. Li Kongji said, \"You still want to hit me?\" Song Chunyong said, \"Hitting you will only dirty my hands.\" And from then on, he wouldn't let him use the ox anymore. In the summer, Li Kongji had only harvested half of his one mu of wheat field, and the ox of Zhang Shuangrong, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, ate the remaining half that was left behind. Li Kongji asked, \"Why did you eat my wheat?\" Zhang Shuangrong said, \"I thought you didn't want it anymore.\" But Li Kongji was afraid of the cadres and dared not say a word, and kept it bottled up in his heart. Once, a woman was dragging white steamed buns to visit relatives, and Zhang Shuangrong met her and said, \"We must be thrifty and not waste.\" At that time, Li Kongji's wife couldn't help but interject and say, \"Is thriftiness meant for feeding oxen!\" Zhang Shuangrong became furious when he heard this and said, \"You don't need to say that. How much wheat did my ox eat from you? How much wheat should I compensate you? I don't want to hear you say this.\" But he didn't compensate even a single grain of wheat. Kongji's house was burned down by the Japanese devils, so he lived in his son-in-law's house. His son-in-law followed the enemy in the Japanese gendarmerie. Taking advantage of his son-in-law's position, he built a latrine. When his son-in-law's property was confiscated, the latrine was also confiscated. Song Chunyong then gave the latrine to Song Zihe, who was the object of struggle, for use, and even instructed Song Zihe to have Li Kongji dig out the feces, because it was too cold to empty the latrine, so he had to work with the object of struggle. In the past, he got very little fruit in the struggle for emancipation. Li Kongji's son, who was a laborer, worked very hard in the militia, but he didn't get any fruit when the fruit was distributed. During the great struggle the year before last, Li Kongji went to distribute the fruit. Yan Xiuqin, the accountant of the Farmers' Association, said, \"You came late, the fruit has all been distributed.\" Others saw that Li Kongji was starving and said, \"Let's give the old man a little bit of what we have.\" Yan Xiuqin was still unwilling, but he said it nicely, \"You are so old and said it, I can't let you lose face, I'll give you some next time.\" The laborer secretly told his father, if they don't give it to us, we don't want it, we don't dare to say more, we can do without it. When filling in the gaps, he was only given five dou of rice, and later he was given some pots and pans, nothing of value. It wasn't until last summer that he was given three mu of land, two mu of which were given to him after others had harvested the wheat. Li Kongji said: Others bully us, and we can't say anything, I look carefully before I dare to take a step, I'm just afraid that people (referring to cadres) will cause trouble.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th - The spokesperson of the People's Liberation Army Headquarters, commenting on the incident of five U.S. Marines participating in the civil war in Wang Lintao, north of Jimo, Shandong, on December 25th of last year, stated: The U.S. Navy Department's attempt to explain that the actions of these five American soldiers did not constitute participation in the Chinese civil war is futile. These five U.S. Marines were fighting the People's Liberation Army more than 100 li away from Qingdao, and at that time, the area was on the front line. At that time, eight brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops were attacking and besieging the People's Liberation Army in Laiyang, amidst the cheers and urgent expectations of the American reactionaries. The spokesperson pointed out: The presence of American armed forces and military personnel on Chinese territory is an insult and violation of China's independence. Except for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who are willingly serving as running dogs of American imperialism, no Chinese person does not resolutely oppose this insult and violation. It is a well-known fact that American armed forces and military personnel are running rampant across China and helping Chiang Kai-shek conduct a civil war. This is entirely an act of imperialist aggression, and the great Chinese nation will never tolerate such aggression.\n\nThe spokesperson pointed out: Since October 1945, American armed forces and military personnel have continuously carried out intrusions and military reconnaissance into the Liberated Areas and put forward unreasonable demands. Important examples include: On October 4, 1945, a U.S. destroyer suddenly arrived in Yantai in the Liberated Area, and a colonel officer landed, demanding that the People's Liberation Army immediately withdraw from Yantai and hand over the Yantai municipal government to the U.S. military for takeover, which was sternly rejected by our side. From October 11 to December 1945, the U.S. military occupied Qinhuangdao and used it as a bridgehead for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops to attack Shanhaiguan and the Northeast Liberated Area. The U.S. military acted as the vanguard for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in attacking Shanhaiguan. In June and July 1946, the U.S. military replaced Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in guarding the Beining Railway and continuously intruded into our Jidong Liberated Area. On July 29, 1946, the famous Anping Incident occurred, in which a U.S. military patrol, in coordination with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, invaded the Anping Liberated Area in Xianghe County, Hebei Province. On March 1, 1947, U.S. military officers Rege and Collins, together with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, invaded our Northeast Democratic Allied Army near Changchun. They were captured by our army and confessed to conducting military reconnaissance, and were released by our army on April 24. On August 27, 1947, two U.S. fighter planes intruded into Langnuankou Xiaolidao, Muping County, in the Jiaodong Liberated Area. One of them was forced to land, and its pilot, Lieutenant Winters, was rescued from danger by our military and civilians. The next day, nine U.S. planes and seven U.S. ships came to the area, and U.S. soldiers on board landed without permission, injuring three villagers and destroying doors, windows, and other objects. After negotiations, U.S. Navy Commander Kirk and Commander of the Seventh Fleet issued written apologies and compensated for the losses, and our army released Winters. All these past facts prove how the American armed forces and military personnel stationed in China are everywhere hostile to the People's Liberation Army, and how the People's Liberation Army has treated them with great leniency. In the Wang Lintao incident in Jimo, Shandong, the People's Liberation Army took completely legitimate measures, and all responsibility should be borne by the U.S. military. In order to avoid the recurrence of such incidents, American military forces and military personnel should stop helping Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang conduct a civil war against the Chinese people, and should immediately withdraw from China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民解放军总部发言人评王麟陶事件  美军参加内战破坏我主权  应停止助蒋并即退出中国\n\n1948-02-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    人民解放军总部发言人评王麟陶事件\n    美军参加内战破坏我主权\n    应停止助蒋并即退出中国\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】人民解放军总部发言人，评去年十二月二十五日美海军陆战队五人，在山东即墨以北王麟陶参加内战之事件称：美国海军部曾企图解释此五名美国士兵之行动，不是参加中国内战，那是徒然的。这五名美国海军陆战队士兵，是在离开青岛一百华里以外的地方，与人民解放军作战，而且当时该地正在火线上，当时蒋介石匪帮的军队八个旅，正在美国反动派的欢呼与迫切期望中，进攻包围莱阳的人民解放军。发言人指出：美国武装力量与军事人员留驻中国领土，是对中国独立的侮辱和侵犯，除了甘心情愿当美国帝国主义走狗的蒋介石匪帮以外，凡是中国人没有不坚决反对这种侮辱和侵犯的。美国的武装力量和军事人员，在中国各地横行无忌，并帮助蒋介石进行内战，这是人所共知的事实，这完完全全是帝国主义的侵略行为，伟大的中华民族，决不能忍受此种侵略。发言人指出：从一九四五年十月以来，美国武装力量与军事人员，不断向解放区实行侵犯与军事侦察，并提出无理要求。其中重要的如：一九四五年十月四日，美国驱逐舰一艘，突然到达解放区的烟台，并有一上校军官登陆，要求人民解放军立即撤离烟台，并将烟台市政府交给美军接管，当被我方严词拒绝。一九四五年十月十一日至十二月，美军占领秦皇岛，并以该地充当蒋介石匪军进攻山海关与东北解放区的桥头堡垒，美军充当蒋介石匪军的向山海关进攻的带路先锋。一九四六年六、七两月，美军代替蒋介石匪军守备北宁铁路，并向我冀东解放区不断侵犯。一九四六年七月二十九日，爆发著名的安平事件，美军巡逻队配合蒋介石匪军，侵犯河北省香河县之安平解放区。一九四七年三月一日美军军官芮格及柯林士二人，在长春附近与蒋介石匪军一同侵犯我东北民主联军，被我军俘获，供认系进行军事侦察，四月二十四日由我军释放。一九四七年八月二十七日，美战斗机两架侵入胶东解放区牟平县浪暖口小里岛，其中一架被迫降落，其驾驶员尉官文特斯被我军民拯救出险。次日美机九架，美舰七艘前来该地，舰上美兵擅自登陆，打伤村民三人，打毁门窗物件，经交涉后，由美海军司令柯克及七十一舰队司令书面道歉与赔偿损失后，我军将文特斯释放。这种种以往的事实，都证明了美国驻华的武装力量与军事人员，如何处处与人民解放军为敌，而人民解放军又如何宽大的对待他们。此次山东即墨王麟陶事件，人民解放军采取了完全正当的措施，一切责任应由美军负责，为了避免这种事件的再度发生，美国军事力量及军事人员，应停止帮助蒋介石匪帮进行反对中国人民的内战，并应当立即退出中国去。"

Pyongyang Radio Station also broadcast excerpts of Chairman Mao's report for 30 minutes. After the *Northeast Daily*, *Liaodong Daily*, and *Andong Daily*, which published Chairman Mao's report on New Year's Day this year, arrived here, the Korean people and personnel of various agencies eagerly read them. When this report was posted on the street, readers crowded around, and Koreans who understood Chinese immediately read the content to those beside them. Chairman Mao's report has now been spread to the hands of overseas Chinese in every corner.\n    North Korean cultural institutions have now established an organization to systematically introduce the main documents of the Chinese Liberated Areas, especially the works of Chairman Mao. They are now working on translating the full text of Chairman Mao's report, the *Chinese People's Liberation Army Launches a Large-Scale Counteroffensive* (Xinhua News Agency editorial on September 12th last year), and the *Outline Land Law of China*, which are expected to be published soon.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th dispatch: Seoul News: Under the joint leadership of the South Korean Communist Party and other progressive political parties, the South Korean people's struggle against the \"United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea's\" conspiracy to divide Korea has now swept the entire territory of South Korea. On the 7th alone, a total of 105 demonstrations, strikes, and other mass struggles occurred in various parts of South Korea. Seoul, Busan Port, and Qiu and other cities have become the centers of mass struggle. It is reported that 30 kilometers of railway tracks outside Seoul were dismantled, and power lines were cut, resulting in a train derailment. The \"Dong-A Ilbo\" newspaper, run by Korean traitors, was also destroyed, and the masses attacked military posts, warehouses, and US-Korean sentry posts. In Busan Port, 26 locomotives were destroyed, and another 23 could not be driven due to the removal of air brakes. U.S. military commander Hodge in South Korea, fearing the new high tide of the South Korean people's movement, is strengthening its violent suppression. U.S. troops and U.S. warships have entered a state of combat readiness. Hodge's curfew was originally scheduled to begin at 11 p.m., but was later moved up to 7 p.m. U.S. and Korean military police have killed and wounded more than 50 people, and another 150 have been arrested. In a letter to Hodge (Commander of the U.S. Military in South Korea) on the 7th, the South Korean General Strike Committee put forward demands such as the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the United Nations Commission from Korea, the transfer of government to the People's Committee, an increase in rice rations, improvement of labor laws, and the release of political prisoners.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北鲜传诵毛主席报告  南鲜人民反分裂运动席卷全境\n\n1948-02-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    北鲜传诵毛主席报告\n    南鲜人民反分裂运动席卷全境\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】平壤讯：中国人民领袖毛主席在中共中央委员会上所作“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告传抵此间后，北鲜各主要报纸，如朝鲜新闻、劳动新闻、民主新闻等迅速将报告摘要地译成朝鲜文字予以发表。平壤广播电台同时用三十分钟的时间，广播了毛主席报告摘要。今年元旦登载毛主席报告的东北日报、辽东日报与安东日报到达此间后，朝鲜人民和各机关人员莫不争先阅读。当街头张贴这一报告时，读者拥挤，懂得中国文字的朝鲜人即时将内容念给他旁边的人听。毛主席的报告现已传播到各个角落里的华侨手中。\n    北鲜的文化机关刻已成立一机构，准备有系统的介绍中国解放区的主要文献，特别是毛主席的著作。现正着手翻译毛主席报告全文、中国人民解放军大举反攻（去年九月十二日新华社社论）、中国土地法大纲等，闻不日即可出版。\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】汉城讯：在南鲜共产党及其他进步政党共同领导下，南鲜人民反抗“联合国朝鲜问题临时委员会”阴谋分裂朝鲜的斗争，现已席卷南鲜全境。仅七日一天内，南鲜各地便发生了示威运动，罢工及其他群众斗争事件共达一百零五起，汉城、釜山海港及邱等城已成为群众斗争之中心地区。据悉：汉城外三十公里之铁轨被拆，电力线被切断，因而造成翻车事件。韩奸卸用报馆“东亚日报”社亦被捣毁，群众并袭击军邮、仓库及美韩哨岗。在釜山港有二十六辆火车头被毁坏，其他二十三辆因取掉空气制动机而不能开驶。南鲜美军司令霍奇惧于南鲜人民运动的新高潮，正加强其暴力镇压，美军和美舰均进入备战状态。霍奇之戒严令原定晚间十一时开始，后又提前至七时，美韩军警已毙伤群众五十名以上，另有一百五十名被捕。南鲜总罢工委员会七日致霍奇（驻南鲜美军司令）函中，提出美军及联合国委员会撤离朝鲜、政府移交人民委员会，增加大米配给量、改善劳工法释放政治犯等要求。"

    "content": "Which way will the Eastern nations lean, towards the United States or towards the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union? The behavior of both sides in Korea can answer this question. During World War II, the Korean people had some illusions about the US military. However, these illusions were shattered from the day the US military entered Korea. After the collapse of Japan, the Korean people revolted, driving out the Japanese local officials and establishing their own municipal councils and national legislative organizations. But the US military, finding that the liberation work had already been completed by the Koreans themselves, felt that it did not conform to the established \"instructions\". Therefore, the commander resolutely demanded the restoration of the original situation, drove the Koreans out, and recalled the Japanese to work under American command. This was the first of a series of painful experiences for the Korean people, which led to their contempt for the United States. Those Koreans who had worked under the Japanese in the past were still employed, while anti-fascist Koreans were refused employment, which aroused the contempt and hatred of the Korean people towards the United States!\n\nWhen the Soviet army entered northern Korea, the Japanese had already been expelled from the government offices, and the Koreans had entered. Moreover, the Soviet Union handed over the real power to the Korean local organizations and the National Assembly. The Koreans in North Korea felt that they were managing their own affairs, so they felt that the various people's organizations were politically reliable.\n\nNow, agriculture in South Korea is even less prosperous than it was under feudalism. The Korean National Assembly has requested the implementation of land redistribution, but this has been rejected by the United States. Several Japanese landlords have been confiscated by the US military, but this makes no difference to the farmers. They now have to pay equal rents to the United States (from one-third to one-half of the harvest). It's just a change of landlords.\n\nComparing the situation in these two regions: In South Korea, under the control of the US military, there is unemployment, and farmers still bear a heavier burden than they did under feudalism. In North Korea, under the Soviet army, everyone has a job, and farmers have their own land.\n\nAlthough South Korea is a rice-producing area, the military government established by the US military collects excessive grain, leading to high rice prices and difficult living conditions, so there is dissatisfaction with the political status quo. On September 25, 1946, a general strike of 40,000 railway workers broke out in South Korea. Democratic youth and patriotic students in South Korea also rose up to respond and assist. At that time, 500,000 workers, peasants, and students participated in the action in various parts of South Korea. The fuse of the railway strike was the military government's order to restrict travel and the transportation and sale of rice. The salaries of railway workers were already very low, and some had to travel back and forth to sell rice to supplement their families. After the government order was issued, feelings of grief and disappointment suddenly erupted. The US military brutally suppressed the workers, creating a bloody incident. This tragedy was the largest in Korean history, so the people of South Korea fell into even greater hatred and contempt for the military government and the US military.\n\nThe factories in North Korea, except for a few metal factories, have all started production. The following is a general overview of the production of the five major factories in the north:\n\n(1) Sup'ung Hydroelectric Power Plant – There are four generators in total.\n\n(2) Chongsu Nitrogen Chemical Factory – This factory is the most modern in the Far East, with a monthly output of 3,000 tons.\n\n(3) Pukchong Light Metal Factory – Before Japan's surrender, the production volume only reached 70% of the original production capacity. By March 1946, the production volume had reached 85%.\n\n(4) Pyongyang Jipon Agricultural Production Company – Mass production of corn starch and corn oil.\n\n(5) Haeju ×× Steel Plant – One of the important factories in the north, with extremely high productivity, manufacturing agricultural machinery, machines, steel rails, etc.\n\nIn addition to the above factories, dozens of others have started production.\n\nThe factories in the north used to be dominated by Japanese financial groups, but now they belong to the North Korean Provisional People's Committee. Its productivity has been improved. The reason for the improvement is the adoption of democratic principles, an eight-hour workday, and enthusiastic work to strive for the establishment of an independent new Korea. Workers and administrative staff in the factory receive equal pay. The factory supervisors are promoted from the ranks of the workers. The workers have a great say in the work through their own organizations. Many senior administrative staff in the factory are former revolutionaries. The only shortage in industrial development and revival is technical talent. Craft schools have now been widely established to cultivate talent.\n\nComparing the north and south regions of Korea, there is truly a difference between hell and paradise.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南鲜和北鲜\n\n1948-02-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    南鲜和北鲜\n    东方民族靠近美国呢？还是靠近以苏联为首的民主阵营呢？看在朝鲜双方的表现就可以知道了。在二次大战中，朝鲜人民是曾对美军有过一些幻想的；可是，从美军进驻朝鲜的那一天起，这幻想就粉碎了。当日本瓦解后，朝鲜人就暴动了，把日本的地方官吏赶走，设立起自己的市政会议和国家的立法组织。而美军发现解放工作已由朝鲜人自己完成了，觉得不符合既定的“指令”，所以指挥官坚决要求恢复当初的情况，把朝鲜人赶出去，又把日本人召回在美国的指挥下工作起来。这是朝鲜人所受的一连串痛苦经验的第一件，也就是使朝鲜人对美国卑视。朝鲜人以往在日本手下作过事的仍然任用，而反法西斯的朝鲜人却被拒绝任用，这就招致了朝鲜人对美国的卑视与仇恨！\n    当苏军进驻朝鲜北部时，日本人已经被逐出官厅，朝鲜人也进去了，而且苏联把实权交给朝鲜人的地方组织和国会，在北鲜的朝鲜人觉得是在自己人管理自己事，所以感到各种人民组织在政治上是可信赖的。\n    现在南鲜的农业还不如封建制度存在时的繁荣了，朝鲜国民议会会请求实行土地重新分配，可是遭到了美国的拒绝，有几个日本地主被美军没收了，但这对于农民没有两样，他们现在也要缴纳相等的地租给美国（从三分之一至二分之一的收获量），这不过是换换地主而已。\n    把这南北两区的情形比较一下：在美军管制的南鲜，失业，而且农民仍然负担重过封建制度的生活；在苏军的北鲜，人人有工作做，而且农民都有自己的土地。\n    南鲜虽然是产米区域，然而美军所设的军政府征粮过多，致米价高涨，民生困窘，所以对政治现状不满。在四六年九月二十五日，南鲜就发生了四万铁路工人的总罢工，民主青年与南鲜爱国学生也起而响应与援助，当时南鲜各地参加行动的工农学生达五十万人。铁路罢工的导火线，是军政府下令限制旅行，限制米谷运销，铁路工人薪俸本极微薄，有些人要往来贩米以补家用。待政府令下后，悲愤失望的情绪猛然爆发。美军则对工人横暴镇压，制造流血事件。这一次的惨案是朝鲜有史以来最大的，因此南鲜的人民对于军政府及美军，就愈陷于仇恨和卑视了。\n    北鲜的工厂，除了少数金属工厂之外，都开工生产了，下面是北部五个大工厂的生产的大概情形：\n    （一）水丰水力发电厂——共有发电机四部。\n    （二）青水氮气化学工厂——这工厂是远东最新式的，每月产量三千吨。\n    （三）北青轻金属工厂——在日本投降以前，生产量只达原生产能力百分之七十，至一九四六年三月，生产量就已达到百分之八十五。\n    （四）平壤ＪＩｐｏｎ农业生产公司——大量制造玉蜀黍淀粉和玉蜀黍油。\n    （五）在海州的××炼钢厂——是北部重要工厂之一，生产率极高，制造农用器械、机器、钢轨等等。\n    除以上各工厂外，开工的还有数十家。\n    北部的工厂以往都受日本财阀的支配，现在是属北鲜临时人民委员会，其生产率已提高，提高的原因是采用了民主原则，一天工作八小时，以及工作热心，争取建立独立新朝鲜之故。厂中工人与行政人员薪水平等，工厂的监督们是由工人层中提补的，工人们通过自己的组织对工作进行上有很大的决定作用，许多工厂高级行政人员，是以往的革命分子。在工业发展与复兴上就是缺少技术人才，目前已普遍成立工艺学校培养人才。\n    就朝鲜南北两区来比较一下，真有地狱与天堂之别。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Comprehensive reports: The Dutch-Indonesian negotiations, which began on December 6th of last year on the American ship \"Renville,\" have come to an end. Under the \"constant pressure\" of the American and Belgian representatives of the \"Three-Nation Mediation Committee,\" the Indonesian side was forced to accept the Dutch terms on truce and settlement of political disputes on the 17th of last month, and officially signed the agreement. The content of the armistice includes a ceasefire in place, recognizing the Van Mook Line of August 29th of last year as the basis for establishing a demilitarized zone, which is maintained by Dutch and Indonesian civil police. The ceasefire order came into effect two weeks after the signing, i.e., January 31st. The main principles for resolving political disputes include: (1) The Kingdom of the Netherlands continues to exercise sovereignty over the territory of the East Indies and establish a provisional joint government until the establishment of the United States of Indonesia, after which it will be transferred; (2) The United States of Indonesia is a sovereign and independent state, on an equal footing with the Netherlands in the Netherlands-Indonesian Federation; (3) The Republic of Indonesia participates in the United States of Indonesia and other member states on an equal footing; (4) Within six months to one year after the signing of the agreement, a \"referendum\" will be held on the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Madura to decide whether the people there will join the Republic of Indonesia or participate in other autonomous states; (5) A constitutional assembly will be established in a \"democratic\" manner to draft the constitution of the United States of Indonesia.\n\nAccording to Agence France-Presse: The representatives of the Republic of Indonesia signed the agreement only after receiving clarification from the \"Mediation Committee\" regarding the rights of the Republic to retain independent military forces, autonomous financial institutions, and dispatch independent diplomatic envoys, and after obtaining guarantees of the above rights from the American representative of the \"Mediation Committee,\" Graham; however, the Belgian representative, Chillon, disclaimed any knowledge of the above explanation. According to a report from the Central News Agency in Batavia, after the American representative, Graham, flew to Yogyakarta on January 24th to meet with President Sukarno and the new Prime Minister Hatta, the \"Mediation Committee\" issued a communique on the evening of the 25th stating that regarding the Indonesian government's recognition of Dutch sovereignty, the Indonesian government claimed that Indonesia could maintain diplomatic autonomy, issue currency, and maintain its military. However, after negotiations in Yogyakarta, the Indonesian President sent a letter to the Chairman of the Mediation Committee (Graham) confirming that the Indonesian government had unconditionally accepted the six political principles.\n\nBatavia's press circles expressed indignation at this kind of \"mediation\" and declared: The \"Three-Nation Mediation Committee\" is a weapon of Wall Street's conspiracy to enslave Indonesia and seize Indonesian raw materials. The committee has helped the Dutch imperialists consolidate their position and opened the way for Wall Street's expansion into Indonesia. Batavia newspapers also revealed that the U.S. State Department is currently considering including Indonesia in the Marshall Plan. American monopoly capital has significantly increased its investment in the islands of Bangka and Belitung (both in eastern Sumatra). Large quantities of zinc, tin, and lead extracted there are now being shipped to the United States. In addition, the United States is drafting a massive plan with the Netherlands to build airports and other facilities for use by the United States on the Indonesian archipelago. The plan will begin in early February and be completed in June.\n\nAccording to the original plan of the American and Dutch imperialists, the \"Federal Council of Indonesia\" was established on January 13th to unite the eleven puppet governments outside the Republic of Indonesia and accelerate the organization of the \"Provisional Federal Indonesia.\" On the 24th, the Dutch authorities held a \"referendum\" on Madura Island. Batavia newspapers said that this vote was an anti-democratic vote and described the vote as follows: In the 2,000 villages on Madura Island, each resident listened to personnel sent by the Dutch read out a decision stating that the relationship between Madura Island and the Republic had been severed since November 11th of last year, and since November 21st, Madura had become an \"autonomous territory cooperating with the Batavia central government.\" Therefore, all men over the age of eighteen were invited to decide whether they were willing for Madura to become an \"independent country\" in the Indonesian Federation. As a result of this vote, it is said that 180,000 out of 290,000 people approved of the so-called \"independent country.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Yogyakarta News: The pro-American, right-wing compromise cabinet of Indonesia was officially established on the 31st of last month. It is reported that Prime Minister Hatta cooperated with the Japanese during the Japanese occupation period and participated in the work of the \"Indonesian Independence Preparatory Committee\"; former Foreign Minister Salim remained in office. In the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations, he welcomed the puppet representatives of East Indonesia. Sukiman, the leader of the Islamic Party, served as the Minister of Interior of the new cabinet. He praised the American tool, the \"Three-Nation Mediation Committee,\" as \"friends of the nation.\" This cabinet did not include any leaders of Indonesian left-wing political parties. The cabinet members are all from the Islamic Party and the Nationalist Party, and some non-partisan figures, purely a right-wing cabinet. According to Indonesian Antara News Agency, Hatta succumbed to American pressure and has recruited extremely reactionary pro-American elements into the cabinet. Broad sections of the Indonesian people oppose this government and demand the restoration of the Sjarifuddin government. Mass rallies and demonstrations were held in various Indonesian towns. The well-known democratic leader Suruso addressed a crowd of 100,000, saying that the 70 million people of Indonesia demand complete freedom and oppose any form of colonial imperialism. Batavia's press pointed out that Graham, the American representative of the Three-Nation Mediation Committee, had lengthy secret negotiations with reactionary leaders within the Islamic Party and the Nationalist Party, who have become reliable fortresses for Wall Street's expansionist policy in Indonesia. These messages from Indonesia illustrate the fact that the recent withdrawal of seven Islamic Party members from the Sjarifuddin cabinet was merely a means of representing \"American pressure.\" They used this to force the Sjarifuddin cabinet to resign, so that pro-American elements could take power. This conspiracy of American imperialism has obviously been fiercely opposed by the broad masses of the Indonesian people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 印荷签订停战协定  卖国贼哈达组新阁  印尼人民坚决反对\n\n1948-02-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    印荷签订停战协定\n    卖国贼哈达组新阁\n    印尼人民坚决反对\n    【新华社陕北十日电】综合报导：于去年十二月六日开始在美舰“伦维尔”号上面举行的荷兰印尼之间的谈判，已经告一段落。在“三国调停委员会”美、比代表的“经常压力”之下，印尼方面被迫于上月十七日接受荷方关于停战与解决政治纠纷的条款，并正式签字。停战协定的内容，包括就地停战，承认去年八月二十九日之穆克分界线为设置非军事化地区之基础，该地区由荷印双方民警维持秩序，停战令于签字后两星期，即上月三十一日开始生效。解决政治纠纷的主要原则，包括：（一）荷兰王国继续在东印度领土上行使主权，成立临时联合政府，直至印尼合众国成立后然后移交；（二）印尼合众国为主权独立国家，在荷兰印尼联邦中与荷兰处于同等地位；（三）印尼共和国参加印尼合众国与其他参加会员国之各邦地位平等；（四）协定签署后六个月至一年之内，在爪哇、苏门答腊、马都拉三岛举行“全民投票”，以决定该处人民并入印尼共和国或参加其他自治邦；（五）以“民主”方式成立立宪会议，草拟印尼合众国宪法。\n    据法新社讯：印尼共和国代表自“调停委员会”接获关于共和国将保有独立军队、财政机构自主及派遣独自之外交使节诸权利之解释，并自“调委会”美代表格拉罕获得上述权利之保证后，始在协定上签字；但比利时代表齐兰对上述解释则推诿不知。又据中央社巴城讯，美代表格拉罕一月二十四日飞往日惹，与苏加诺总统及新总理哈达晤谈后，二十五日晚“调委会”发表公报称：关于印尼共和国政府承认荷兰主权一节，印尼政府声称：印尼得保持外交自主、发行通货，保存军队等权利。但在日惹方面商谈后，印尼总统今致函调委会主席（格拉罕），证实印尼政府已无条件接受六项政治原则。\n    巴城新闻界人士对此种“调处”表示愤懑；并宣称：“三国调委会”乃华尔街阴谋奴役印尼及夺取印尼原料之武器。该委员会帮助了荷兰帝国主义者巩固其地位；并为华尔街对印尼的扩张开辟了道路。巴城报纸同时透露：美国国务院现正考虑将印尼包括于马歇尔计划之中。美国独占资本已显著地增加在邦加、勿里洞（都在苏门答腊东）各岛的投资。该处开采之大量锌、锡、铅，现正运往美国。此外，美国正与荷兰草拟一庞大计划，在印尼群岛上建立供给美国使用之机场等。计划将于二月初开始，六月完成。\n    根据美荷帝国主义者的原定计划，“印尼联邦委员会”已于一月十三日成立，以纠合印尼共和国以外之十一个傀儡政府，加速组织“印尼临时联邦”。二十四日荷兰当局在马都拉岛举行了“公民投票”，巴城报纸谓此次投票，系反民主的投票，并如此描写着这次投票道：马都拉岛二千个村庄，每个居民都听着荷兰派出的人员，念读一项决定，其中称：马都拉岛与共和国间的关系，已自去年十一月十一日起断绝，自十一月二十一日起，马都拉即成为“与巴达维亚中央政府合作的自治领”。因此，凡十八岁以上的男子，均被邀决定是否愿意马都拉在印尼联邦中成为“独立国”。这样表决结果，据说二十九万人中有十八万人赞成了所谓“独立国”。\n    【新华社陕北十日电】日惹讯：印尼亲美的右冀妥协内阁，已于上月三十一日正式成立。据悉，总理哈达曾在日寇占领时期与日寇合作，参加“印尼独立筹备委员会”的工作；前内阁外长沙立姆仍然留任，他在此次荷印谈判中，曾对于东印尼的傀儡代表表示欢迎。回教党的领袖苏基曼担任新阁内政部长，他曾经称颂美国的工具——“三国调停委员会”为“民族的朋友”。这个内阁没有包括任何一个印尼左冀政党领袖在内，阁员都是回教党和国民党人及若干无党派人士，纯为清一色的右派内阁。据印尼安塔拉通讯社消息，哈达对美国压力屈服，已网罗极反动集团内亲美分子入阁。印尼人民中广大阶层均反对此一政府；并要求恢复沙利佛丁政府。印尼各城镇均举行群众大会及示威游行。著名民主领袖苏尔索向十万群众演说称：印尼七千万人民要求完全自由，反对任何形式的殖民帝国主义。巴达维亚报界人士指出：三国调停委员会美国代表格拉罕，曾与回教党及国民党内的反动领袖进行长时间的秘密谈判，后者已成为华尔街在印尼扩张政策之可靠堡垒。这些来自印尼的消息，说明了一个事实，日前七名回教党人退出沙利佛丁内阁之举，不过是代表“美国的压力”之一种手段，他们以此来迫使沙利佛丁内阁辞职，使亲美分子得以执政。美国帝国主义的这一阴谋，显然已遭到广大印尼人民的激烈反对。"

Recently, two camps in Italy have been engaged in fierce struggles for the general election. After Gasperi co-opted the Republican Party and the Saragat Party in mid-December last year, giving them the position of Deputy Prime Minister, he vigorously promoted the \"centrism\" of his government in order to deceive public opinion; at the same time, he further sold himself to the United States. With the full support of the American master, the reactionary government is prepared to use force to suppress the upcoming general election. According to TASS: The Gasperi government has ordered the conscription of 20,000 former fascist soldiers to join the \"security team\" for use during the election. Three hundred American armored vehicles have entered Rome to equip these \"security teams.\" At the same time, the Italian cabinet has passed a bill abolishing the \"military organization\" law and sentencing the leaders of \"military organizations for political purposes\" to two to ten years of imprisonment. This reactionary measure has aroused widespread protests from Italian democrats and public opinion. L'Unità pointed out that this decree is a provocative act against guerrillas and other democratic organizations, and its purpose is to create an extremely tense atmosphere during the election. Longo, commander of the Garibaldi Guerrilla Brigade, telegraphed the Italian President, protesting this anti-people provocative action, and suggested that a meeting of all the leaders of the former \"Liberation Volunteer Corps\" be held to discuss the situation caused by the Gasperi government's desire to \"destroy the glorious tradition of the guerrilla movement.\" Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti strongly condemned this as \"Gasperi's and the Christian Democratic Party's election conspiracy.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反动政府操纵大选向人民挑衅  意民主人士广泛抗议\n\n1948-02-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    反动政府操纵大选向人民挑衅\n    意民主人士广泛抗议\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：在意人民的压力下，加斯贝利反动政府被迫于五日宣布：大选将于四月十八日举行。最近，意国内两个阵营正为大选展开了激烈的斗争。加斯贝利在去年十二月中旬拉拢共和党及萨拉盖特党给予副总理职位后，即大事宣传其政府的“中间性”，借以欺骗舆论；同时又进一步向美国卖身投靠。在美国主子全力支持下，反动政府已准备在即将到来的大选中使用武力弹压。据塔斯社讯：加斯贝利政府已命令征集二万前法西斯士兵加入“保安队”，供选举期间之用。美军三百辆装甲车已开入罗马装备这些“保安队”。同时，意内阁已通过废除“军事组织”法案及对“以政治为目的之军事组织”的领袖判处二年至十年徒行。这一反动措施已引起意民主人士及舆论的广泛抗议。团结报指出：这个法令是对游击队及其它民主组织的挑衅行为，其目的在于在选举时造成极紧张气氛。加黎波的游击纵队司令隆哥致电意总统，抗议这种反人民的挑衅行动，并建议由一切前“解放志愿兵团”的领袖集会，以讨论因加斯贝利政府欲“破坏游击队运动的光荣传统”而引起的局势。意共总书记托格里亚蒂力斥这是“加斯贝利与基督教民主党的选举阴谋。”"

We hope that everyone will write down their questions and send them to us, and we will do our best to solve your difficulties in reading the newspapers.\n    ——Editor\n\n    Which Eastern Countries Exist in the World?\n    Editor Comrade:\n        We are learning from Chairman Mao's report \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks,\" paragraph one, line fifteen, which says: \"Also because this event occurred in the East of the world, where there are more than one billion people (accounting for half of humanity)...\" Besides China's 450 million people, these more than 550 million people are from which Eastern countries? What countries are included in the East? Where are these places and how many people live there? Because I am from a poor peasant background and did not go to school, I only learned a few characters after joining our revolutionary ranks. Therefore, I am not clear about the map of the world. Please reply and help me.\n        Ma Fang, Xinxiang County Public Security Bureau\n\n    [Answer] The more than one billion oppressed people in the East that Chairman Mao mentioned in his report \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks\" refers to the 550 million people in countries such as Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Siam (Thailand), Vietnam, Burma, and India, in addition to China's 450 million people. The people of these countries all regard our liberated areas as their big brother, as their good friend and role model in striving for liberation. The influence of Mao Zedong Thought is expanding among the people of these countries day by day. Now, let's briefly discuss the population and democratic forces of these countries:\n\n    India, located southwest of China, bordering China's Xinjiang and Tibet, has a population of over 380 million. The Communist Party of India is one of the three major political parties in the country (the other two are the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League), with more than 53,000 members, and is an important force leading the Indian people's independence and democratic movement and uniting the Indian and Muslim masses. (Note: Due to the interference of British imperialism, India has unfortunately been divided into two states, India and Pakistan.)\n\n    Japan, located east of China (separated by a vast ocean), has a population of over 72.22 million. The Japanese Communist Party has 60,000 members and enjoys high prestige among the Japanese people, leading the Japanese people's democratic movement.\n\n    Korea, connected to our Northeast Liberated Area's Andong Province (separated only by the Yalu River), has a population of over 22.89 million. North and South Korea were previously occupied by Japan. After defeating Japan, they were controlled by Soviet and American troops. The Soviet Union occupied the northern half, and the American troops occupied the southern half. The two places are a clear contrast between democracy and reaction. The people of North Korea have implemented land reform and have gained democratic freedom, while the people of South Korea are still suffering from heavy oppression and exploitation due to the support of American imperialism for reactionaries. The Korean Communist Party has 50,000 members, leading the North Korean democratic government. The people of South Korea are also constantly launching democratic movements against oppression and striving for freedom.\n\n    Vietnam, connected to China's southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, has a population of 21.45 million. Viet Cong leader Ho Chi Minh leads the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in fighting French imperialism.\n\n    Burma, bordering China's southwestern Tibet and Yunnan provinces, and India to the west, has a population of 14 million. The Burmese Communist Party has 6,000 members, leading the country's \"Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League,\" resisting British imperialism and striving for independence.\n\n    Siam (Thailand), located between Burma and Vietnam, bordering China's Yunnan Province to the north, has a population of 11.5 million. Due to the strength of the people's forces, the government was forced to abolish the \"Anti-Communist Law\" last year, and the Siamese Communist Party has become a legal political party.\n\n    The Philippines, located southeast of Guangdong Province (across the sea), has a population of 10.31 million and is an \"independent country\" under the leadership of the United States (just like the \"Manchukuo\" of the past). However, the Philippine People's Guerrilla Force led by the Philippine Communist Party is resolutely fighting against the counter-revolutionary Roxas government. There are many overseas Chinese in the People's Guerrilla Force.\n\n    Indonesia, located further south than the Philippines, is a group of small islands in the vast ocean, previously occupied by the Netherlands and Japan, with a population of 70 million. The Indonesian Communist Party has 35,000 members, leading the Indonesian People's Liberation Army in fighting Dutch imperialism and striving for independence.\n\n    Malaya, located south of Siam, opposite Sumatra Island in Indonesia, has a population of 4.4 million. There are many overseas Chinese and is still under British imperialist rule and oppression. The Malayan Communist Party has 16,000 members and leads the Malayan people in constant anti-British struggles.\n\n  What is a \"Flame Thrower\"?\n    Editor Comrade:\n        The People's Daily on February 1st published the People's Liberation Army Headquarters' announcement of the December war achievements on the first page, and the term \"flame thrower tool\" was among the captured items. This term is constantly being published in the newspaper, but I only know that it is a weapon, but I don't know what form it takes, nor do I know how much of a role it can play in combat. Sometimes when reading the newspaper to the masses, the masses constantly ask what this weapon is, and I don't understand it myself, so I can't answer them. Please help me answer it.\n        Wang Zhichao, Teacher of Lujia Xiaotun\n\n    (Answer) Flame throwers are available in four types: light, medium, heavy, and special. Ordinary ones are mounted on large trucks, with only one unit per truck. Sometimes it is mounted on a tank, which is called a flame-throwing tank. Its structure is very complex, and it is impossible to explain its appearance here. Roughly speaking, it is a machine with a mixture of several kinds of chemicals. This machine can spray this chemical far away. As soon as this chemical comes out, it catches fire when it hits the air. When it is fired, it makes a whooshing sound, and it sprays out a long flame and a trail of smoke. Heavy flame throwers can spray 80 meters (more than 20 zhang) away, and the maximum firing time is one and a half minutes; light ones can spray 10 meters to 40 meters away, and the firing time can be 20 seconds to 40 seconds. After firing, it takes a long time to reload the chemical before it can be fired again. Because it doesn't spray very far and the time is not long, the lethality is not very great. However, when it suddenly rushes in front of the opponent and the opponent is not mentally prepared, and does not understand such a thing, it will feel threatened in spirit. In addition, because it is very bulky, difficult to move, and very complex, the user must receive a long period of technical training, and it is not easy to replenish after being killed or injured. It also needs to be used with the wind, otherwise it cannot be used. This weapon is suitable for melee combat and night combat, and requires strong infantry to cover it; Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are not good at this, so even if they get this new type of weapon given to them by their American daddy, it is not very useful, at most it plays a supplementary role, and it cannot play a major role in the victory or defeat of the entire battle.\n\n    Our People's Liberation Army is good at melee combat and night combat, and has strong infantry. If we get this weapon, it can be helpful in attacking strongholds when fighting in cities. We captured a total of eight units in the second half of last year; when we eliminated Chiang Kai-shek's main force, the 74th Division, in Menglianggu, Shandong, we captured twelve units at once, and we also got three units when we fought Chiang Kai-shek's 83rd Division in Lunan last summer.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 时事问答\n马芳  王智超\n1948-02-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    时事问答\n    同志们读报纸上的时事消息有什么困难没有？哪些地方有疑问？希望大家有问题就写出来寄给我们，我们一定尽力为大家解决读报的困难。\n  ——编者\n  世界的东方都有哪些国家编辑同志：\n    我们学习毛主席报告“目前形势和我们的任务”头一段第十五行说：“还因为这个事变发生在世界的东方，在这里共有十万万以上人口（占人类一半）……”这十万万以上人口除了中国四万万五千万人口外，还有五万万五千万以上人口，是东方哪些国家的人口？东方都包括哪几个国家？哪些地方有多少人口？因为我是贫农出身，没有上过学，就是来到咱革命阵营里才学了几个字；所以对世界上地图上弄不明确，请答复帮助为盼。\n      新乡县公安局马芳\n    【答】毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”报告中所说的东方十万万以上被帝国主义压迫的人口，是指的除了中国四万万五千万人外，还有朝鲜、日本、菲律滨、印度尼西亚、马来亚、暹罗（泰国）、越南、缅甸和印度等国家的五万万五千多万人。这些国家的人民都把咱们解放区当作他们的老大哥，当作他们争取解放的好朋友和好榜样，毛主席思想影响在这些国家的人民中间正一天比一天扩大。现在分别把这些国家的人口及民主势力简单说一下：\n    印度，在中国的西南边，挨着中国的新疆和西藏。有三万万八千多万人民。印度的共产党是该国三大政党之一（另二大党是印度国大党和回教同盟），有共产党员五万三千多人，是领导印度人民的独立民主运动和团结印、回两教群众的重要力量。（按：由于英帝从中捣鬼，印度现已不幸被分为印度与巴基斯坦两个邦。）\n    日本，在中国的东边（隔着一片大海），有七千二百二十二万多人。日本共产党有六万党员，在日本人民中的威信很高，是日本人民民主运动领导者。\n    朝鲜，和咱们东北解放区安东省相连接（只隔一条鸭绿江），有二千二百八十九万多人。鲜北和鲜南过去被日本侵占，把日本打败后是苏军和美军管制着，苏联占北半部，美军占南半部。两处是民主与反动的鲜明的对照，鲜北人民实行土地改革，已得到民主自由，而鲜南由于美帝国主义扶持反动派，人民仍受着重重压迫，层层剥削的痛苦。朝鲜共产党已有五万党员，领导鲜北民主政府。鲜南人民也不断掀起反压迫争自由的民主运动。\n    越南，和中国西南的云南、广西两省相连，人口有二千一百四十五万。越共领袖胡志明同志领导着越南人民共和国，对法帝国主义战斗。\n    缅甸，挨着中国西南的西藏和云南省、西边和印度相连；人口一千四百万。缅共有党员六千，领导该国“反法西斯人民自由联盟”，反抗英帝国主义，争取独立。\n    暹罗（泰国），在缅甸和越南的中间，北边跟中国云南省相连，人口有一千一百五十万，由于人民力量强大，政府前年被迫废除“反共法案”，暹共已成合法政党。\n    非律滨，在广东省东南边（隔着海）。人口一千零三十一万是美国领导下的“独立国”（就象过去的“满洲国”那样的“独立国”。）但菲共领导下的菲律滨人民游击队正与反革命的罗哈斯政府作坚决斗争。在人民游击队中有很多华侨。\n    印度尼西亚，比菲律滨还靠南，是大海洋里的一群小岛，过去曾被荷兰和日本占领，有七千万人口。印尼共产党有三十五名党员，领导印尼人民解放军和荷兰帝国主义战斗，争取独立。\n    马来亚，在暹罗南边，和印尼的苏门答腊岛相对。有四百四十万人，有很多华侨，仍受英帝统治压迫。马来亚共产党有一万六千党员领导马来亚人民不断作着反英斗争。\n  “火焰喷射器”是什么东西编辑同志：\n    二月一日的人民报上第一版登载着人民解放军总部公布十二月份战绩，缴获里有“火焰喷射器工具”这个名词在报纸上不断的登载，但是只知道是一种武器，不知到是啥形式，也不知道在战斗中能起多大作用，有时给群众读报，群众不断问这是啥武器，自己也不了解无法给群众解答，请你们帮助解答一下为盼。\n            吕家小屯教员王智超\n    （答）火焰喷射器有轻型、中型、重型和特种类型四种；普通是装在大汽车上，一辆汽车只能装一具。有时把它装在坦克车上，就叫喷火坦克。它的构造很复杂，样子在这里说也说不明白。大概说来是一套机器里面着几种东西混合起来的药水，这机器能把这药水喷出来喷得很远。这药水一出来，碰到空气就会着起火来。在放射的时候，呼呼的响着，就喷出很长的火焰和一溜烟。重型喷火器能喷八十公尺（廿多丈）远，放射时间最长能放一分半钟；轻型的能喷十公尺到四十公尺远，放射时间能有二十秒到四十秒钟。放射了得隔很久再装上药水才能再放射。因为喷射得并不远，时间也不长，杀伤力是不很大的。只不过在它忽然冲到对方面前而对方思想上没有准备，对这样一个家伙不了解的时候，就会在精神上感到威胁。另外，因为它很笨重，不易运动；又很复杂，使用的人得受较长时期的技术训练，被杀伤后也不容易补充。放射的时候还要顺风，不顺风就不能用。这种武器适宜于打交手仗，打夜战，而且需要有坚强的步兵作掩护；蒋匪正不善于这一套，所以拿上这种他美国洋爸爸给他的这种新式武器也没多大用，顶多起一点辅助作用，对整个战斗的胜负起不了主要作用。\n    而咱解放军则善于打交手仗，打夜战，又有坚强的步兵，拿到这种武器，在打城市时用它攻坚倒还可以有些帮助。去年下半年咱共缴获了八具；在山东孟良消灭蒋匪主力七十四师的时候，一次就缴获了十二具，去年夏天在鲁南打蒋匪八十三师的时候也得了三具。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Organizing Mass Supervision to Oppose Bureaucracy\n    (Excerpt from \"A Brief Biography of Lenin's Life and Career\")\n\n    Lenin believed that organizing supervision and absorbing workers and peasants—especially women—to participate in this work was the most important thing. Comrade Stalin was appointed as the People's Commissar to preside over the State Supervision Department. In April 1919, Lenin wrote to Stalin, saying that the main tasks in supervision work were to conduct surprise inspections based on citizens' complaints, to take revolutionary measures against abuse of power and bureaucratic delays, and to improve labor productivity and increase the quantity of products. Lenin believed that the supervisory organs were a powerful tool for absorbing the working masses to participate in state work. To this end, the State Supervision Department was reorganized into the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection in 1920. Lenin discussed this with Stalin and wrote to him: \"The aim is to absorb all the working masses, whether men or especially women, to participate in the work of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection.\"\n    Lenin meticulously checked the implementation of this instruction (referring to the instructions of the Labor and Defense Council drafted by Lenin in 1921 to the local Soviets regarding the basic tasks of economic construction) in various places, believing that this was the beginning of the realization of the idea of ​​implementing mass supervision and having local authorities inspect the work of central agencies, and a method of attracting non-Party masses loyal to the cause of socialist construction to participate in state administration.\n    Lenin believed that attracting the masses to manage the state was one of the most important tasks. He often taught that the Soviet regime should strive to attract all laborers, Party members and non-Party members, men and women, to actively participate in the cause of state construction and economic construction.\n    While educating the masses, Lenin also learned from the masses. Lenin relentlessly denounced all those who looked at the masses with arrogance, attempted only to teach the masses but forgot that they must learn from the masses, understand their actions, carefully study and synthesize their practical struggle experience.\n    Lenin had countless ties with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and he also perseveringly sought and strived to establish new connections. In January 1922, Lenin wrote to the editor of the \"Poor Peasants' Newspaper\": \"Could you briefly indicate (at most two or three pages): How many letters from peasants has the Poor Peasants' Newspaper received? What important (especially important) and new things are there in these letters? What is the mood? Urgent issues? Is it possible to receive peasant letters once every two months?\"\n    Talking with workers and peasants, speaking at mass meetings, at the broad production representative meetings of trade unions, at the non-Party worker-peasant representative meetings, at the non-Party representative discussion meetings of various congresses, and at countless other meetings, talking with worker-peasant correspondents, studying letters—these were the sources of Lenin's contact with the masses.\n    Extremely deep faith in the masses was Lenin's characteristic. Consolidating ties with the masses was the issue that Lenin constantly reminded the Party to pay attention to. \"Only when we correctly represent the people's consciousness can we govern,\" Lenin said at the Eleventh Party Congress in the spring of 1922. The people knew that Lenin loved them, so they trusted Lenin infinitely. The workers said: \"Lenin is ourselves.\"\n    Comrade Stalin described Lenin's spirit of believing in the masses in his speech at the evening party of students at the Kremlin Military School with the following words: \"Apart from Lenin, I don't know of another revolutionary who believed so deeply in the creative power of the proletariat, in the revolutionary appropriateness of the proletarian instinct...\" Therefore, Lenin tirelessly advocated: Learn from the masses, understand the actions of the masses, carefully study the practical experience of the masses' struggle.\n    Faith in the creative ability of the masses—this was such a characteristic in Lenin's activities, a characteristic that enabled him to understand the spontaneous forces and guide the movement of these spontaneous forces onto the track of the proletarian revolution.\n    Lenin could not tolerate the habit of exaggeration and required that simplicity and humility be displayed everywhere, and at the same time he himself was a model of this extraordinary humility. The workers used the following sentence to describe Lenin's simple spirit: \"As simple as truth.\" \"This simple spirit and humble attitude of Lenin, this spirit of wanting not to stand out, at least not to attract attention and not to deliberately praise his lofty position—this characteristic is precisely one of the most powerful qualities of Lenin as a new-style leader of the new-style masses—the most \"bottom-level\" masses of simple ordinary human beings.\"\n    Lenin believed that the state organs had a very important role in the nationwide socialist transformation and in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.\n    Lenin fiercely opposed any delays and bureaucracy. He took all the most resolute measures against bureaucrats and those who delayed and bungled things. He instructed that the Soviet organs, which were responsible for fighting bureaucracy, must not take a formalistic attitude towards any issue. He demanded that cases related to delays and bureaucracy be submitted to the courts for trial, believing that judges must severely punish those guilty of delaying and bungling things. He instructed that judges must be \"urged by the Central Committee.\"\n    In September 1921, Lenin said in a special letter to the People's Commissar of Justice: During the autumn and winter, the Moscow court must try five or six cases of delaying and bungling things in Moscow, select \"significant\" facts, and turn each trial into a \"political\" case. Find several smart \"experts\" who are good at identifying delays and bungling things, they should be particularly good at \"exposing the crime of delaying and bungling things\"; issue an explanatory letter on punishing the crime of delaying and bungling things.\n    Lenin could not tolerate deception, and he was especially severe with those who stole socialist property. He took the most severe measures against all phenomena of wasting public funds and stealing state property. Lenin was not deceived. He demanded straightforwardness and sincerity everywhere.\n    In 1921, a Red Army soldier came to Moscow to report to Lenin that some staff members in the Don region were acting ultra vires and embezzling public funds for private gain. In his letter to Lenin, this comrade pointed out that these actions made the workers and working people deeply dissatisfied. Lenin immediately forwarded a copy of this letter to Comrade Molotov, the Central Committee Secretary; proposed that a special committee composed of several members of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and one or two dozen students from Sverdlov University be sent to the Don region, taking the person who wrote the letter with them, and those who were confirmed to have committed theft should be shot on the spot. Regarding the person who wrote the letter, Lenin wrote in a note to the secretary: \"Find the author of the letter immediately, meet with him, comfort him, and tell him that I am ill, but I will urge the handling of the case he raised.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 组织群众监督反对官僚主义  （摘录“列宁生平事业简史”里的一段）\n\n1948-02-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    组织群众监督反对官僚主义\n    （摘录“列宁生平事业简史”里的一段）\n    列宁认为组织监督，吸收工人和农民——尤其是妇女——来参加这个工作，是最重要的事情。任命为人民委员来主持国家监督部的，就是斯大林同志。一九一九年四月，列宁写信给斯大林说，在监督工作方面的主要任务，就是要根据公民控告来作突然的检查，要采取革命手段对付滥用职权和官场因循延搁的现象，要提高劳动生产率和增多产品数量。列宁认为监督机关是吸收劳动群众来参加国家工作的强大工具。为此目的，就于一九二○年把国家监督部改组为工农检查院。列宁曾同斯大林商量，并对他写道：“目的是：把全体劳动群众，无论是男人，尤其是妇女，都吸收来参加工农检查院的工作。”\n    列宁非常细心检查各地执行这个指令（按指一九二一年列宁所拟定的劳动国防委员会关于经济建设事业的基本任务给各地方苏维埃的指令）的情形，认为这是他所提倡的实行群众监督和由地方检查中央机关工作的思想实现的开始，是吸引忠实于社会主义建设事业的非党群众来参加国家管理机关的方法。\n    列宁认为吸引群众来管理国家是最重要的任务之一。他经常教导说，苏维埃政权力求把一切劳动者，党员和非党员，男子和妇女，都吸引来积极参加国家建设和经济建设的事业。\n    列宁一面教育群众，一面又向群众学习。列宁无情地痛斥一切以高傲态度看待群众，企图只教导群众而忘记必须向群众学习，理解其行动，细心研究并综合其实际斗争经验的人。\n    列宁有千丝万线同广大工农群众联系着，还坚毅地寻找并力求建立新的联系。一九二二年一月，列宁给“贫农报”的编辑写道：“是否可以简略示知（最多两三页）：贫农报收到了多少农民书信？在这些信中有什么重要的（特别重要的）和新的东西？情绪怎样？迫切问题？是否可以每两个月得到一次农民信件？”\n    同工农接谈，在群众大会上，在职工会的广大生产代表会议上，在非党员工农代表会议上，在各代表大会非党员代表谈话会上，以及在无数其他会议上发言，同工农通讯员谈话，研究来信——这就是列宁同群众发生联系的泉源。\n    极深刻地相信群众，就是列宁的特点。巩固与群众的联系——这就是列宁所经常提醒党来注意的问题。“只有当我们是正确代表人民意识时，我们才能管理。”——列宁于一九二二年春天在第十一次党代表大会上这样说道。民众知道列宁是爱护他们的，所以他们无限信任列宁。工人们说道：“列宁就是我们自己。”\n    斯大林同志在克里姆里军校学生晚会上的演说中用以下的话来形容列宁确信群众的精神：“除列宁而外，我再也不知道有第二个革命者是象列宁那样深信无产阶级的创造力量，深信无产阶级本能的革命适当性的……。”因此，列宁就始终不倦地鼓吹着：向群众学习吧，理解群众的行动吧，细心研究群众斗争的实际经验吧。\n    确信群众的创造能力，——这就是列宁活动中的这样一个特点，这个特点曾使他有可能来理解自发势力，并把这自发势力的运动引上无产阶级革命的轨道。\n    列宁不能忍耐浮夸习气，要求到处都表现简朴精神和谦逊态度，同时他自己就是这种格外谦逊的模范。工人们用以下一句话来形容列宁的简朴精神：“如真理一样简朴。”“列宁这种简朴精神和谦逊态度，这种很想不露头角，至少是不惹人注目和不故意表彰自己崇高地位的精神，——这个特性正是列宁为新式群众——简单平常的人类最“下层”群众——的新式领袖最有力品质之一。”\n    列宁认为，国家机关在全国社会主义改造中和巩固工农联盟事业中有非常重要的作用。\n    列宁激烈反对任何延搁习气和官僚主义。他采取各种最坚决的办法反对官僚和延搁误事者。他指示说，负有同官僚主义斗争责任的苏维埃机关，对于任何问题都不可持形式主义的态度。他要求把关系于延搁习气和官僚主义的案件提交法庭审判，认为必须使法官严厉惩治延滞误事的罪人。他指示说必须“由中央来督促法官。”\n    一九二一年九月，列宁在致司法人民委员的专信中说：必须在秋冬期间由莫斯科法庭审判莫斯科五六件延搁误事的罪案，挑选“显著的”事实并把每一次审判都变成“政治”案子。找几个善于鉴别延搁误事的聪明“专家”，他们应当特别善于“检举延搁误事罪”；颁布一种论惩治延搁误事罪的解释信。\n    列宁不能容忍欺骗行为，而对于那些盗窃社会主义财产的行为尤极严厉。他采取最严厉的办法对付一切浪费公款和盗窃国产的现象。列宁是不受欺骗的。他到处都要求爽直和真诚。\n    一九二一年有一个红军战士来到莫斯科向列宁报告，说在顿河省有某些工作人员越权行事和盗公肥私。这个同志在致列宁信中指出，这些行为使工人和劳动人民深为不满。列宁即刻把这封信的一份抄本转交中央书记莫洛托夫同志；提议由全俄中央执行委员会委员中指定几个人和一二十个斯维尔德洛夫大学学生组成一个特别委员会派到顿河区去，把写这封信的人随身带去，把那些证实为确犯盗窃罪者就地枪毙。对于写这封信的人，列宁在给书记的字条上写道：“火速找到来信作者，接见他，安慰他，告诉他说，我有病，但他所提出的案子，我是会督促办理的。”"

Under the then-urgent combat situation, our frontline troops immediately took self-defensive counterattacks, seriously wounding Private Brighton. After being wounded, the soldier was rescued by our army and sent to a field hospital, where he died due to the severity of his injuries. Squad Leader Pollard, along with soldiers Dixson, Private First Class Jabodistria, and Private First Class Hart, were captured alive, and five guns were seized. Investigation reveals that these five US soldiers were serving in the Western Pacific Fleet Command. At the very moment when our army was engaged in a fierce battle with Chiang's bandits, they actually accompanied Chiang's bandit troops into the battlefield, invading our frontline positions. This is solid evidence of direct US assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's war effort. The local military and civilians are filled with indignation, unanimously believing that this action is a serious act of undermining the friendship between the Chinese and American people. Our Jiaodong Military Region Headquarters has lodged a serious protest with the US Navy, demanding that the US side apologize and guarantee that US troops will not invade our liberated areas again, and that US troops will not assist Chiang's bandit army in fighting against us again. Otherwise, if similar incidents occur again in the future, the consequences shall be entirely borne by the US military and the US government. If the responsible authorities of the US Navy can accept our above-mentioned reasonable demands, we will, in the spirit of friendship between the Chinese and American people, treat the captured US soldiers leniently.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美军犯我胶东王麟陶阵地  我军坚决自卫反击\n\n1948-02-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    美军犯我胶东王麟陶阵地\n    我军坚决自卫反击\n    【新华社华东十三日电】迟到消息：去年十二月二十五日，我解放军正与进犯莱阳蒋匪八个旅激战之际，美海军陆战队伍长波拉德率领士兵四名，乘吉普车一辆，于胶东解放区即墨县属瓦前区王麟陶（即墨北五十里）附近，突然进逼我军阵地，在当时紧急战斗情况下，我火线部队即采取自卫反击，重伤其上等兵布莱顿一名，该兵负伤后，由我军救护，送往野战医院后，因伤重毙命。生俘伍长波拉德一名，及士兵逖克逊，上等兵贾波迪斯特利亚，上等兵哈脱等士兵三名，缴枪五支。按查该五名美军系在西太平洋舰队司令部服务，此次正当我军与将匪激战时，竟伴随蒋匪军混入战地，向我火线侵犯，实为直接帮助蒋匪作战之铁证，当地军民对此莫不愤慨填胸，咸认此举显系严重破坏中美人民友谊之行动。我胶东军区司令部已向美海军方面提出严重抗议，并要求美方道歉，保证美军今后不得再侵犯我解放区，及美军不得再援助蒋匪军向我作战，否则，倘今后再发生类似情事，其后果均应由美军及美国政府完全负责。如果美海军机关负责方面，能接受我上述合理要求，则我对被俘美军，亦本中美人民友谊精神宽大处理。"

In order to cope with this serious situation, the Labor government has launched a fierce attack on the wages of British laborers.

The union believes that \"merely controlling wages without controlling prices and profits is unacceptable to workers.\" Many union leaders have stated that they will lead the struggle regardless of Attlee's recommendations. Fergus, acting general secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen, said that they are leading 759,000 railway workers to fight for a new wage system. White, general secretary of the Civil Service Association, insisted: \"The salary increase requests of 250,000 people have been rejected by the government, but we will continue to fight for them.\" The Electrical Trades Union and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, which has 2.5 million members, have stated that they will soon propose wage increases and will discuss the situation after the government's statement is issued. According to the Daily Mail, union lawyers representing 470,000 workers have rejected the government's wage policy and demanded active and strict control over prices and profits. The Daily Telegraph believes that the cabinet is facing a very serious test on this issue.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th: London: The British Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, resolutely protested the Labor government's attack on the wages of the working people. The newspaper pointed out that the Labor government's decision to stop wage increases is actually a denial of maintaining wage levels in all industrial sectors, while factory profits and prices are increasing day by day. The newspaper continued: This attack on the vital interests of the working people is disguised by the nonsense of curbing inflation. However, the Labor government has no intention of increasing capital taxes, cutting the armed forces, or eliminating the huge profits of capitalists to curb these real factors that constitute inflation. The Daily Worker called on all trade union members to unite more closely and oppose the Attlee government's all-out attack on the people's living standards and the attempt to increase the wealth of capitalists at the expense of workers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英总工会通过决议  反对冻结工资水平\n\n1948-02-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    英总工会通过决议\n    反对冻结工资水平\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国经济形势日益恶化。艾德礼、克里浦斯最近相继发出了“经济形势严重”的悲鸣，而目前只剩余二千五百万镑的美国贷款，亦将于马歇尔计划生效以前一个月用完。为了应付这种严重的形势，工党政府对英国劳工的工资，发动了猛烈的进攻。英政府在其日前发表的“白皮书”中，宣布将工人工资固定于目前的水平。这一反动政策虽然得到保守党及美国反动报章的拍手欢迎，但在英国职工会中，却引起了一片尖锐抗议声。英总工会通过了反击政府的决议。该会认为“仅仅管制工资而不管制物价及利润，这决不能为工人所接受”。很多工会领袖声明，他们将不顾艾德礼的建议而领导斗争。全国铁路工人工会代理总书记费加斯说：他们正领导七十五万九千铁路工人争取新的工资制度。公务员协会总书记怀特坚称：“二十五万人的增资要求，被政府拒绝了，但我们将继续争取”。电气职工联合会及拥有二百五十万会员的造船与机械工会联合会等工会，均声明即将提出增资要求，并将讨论政府声明发表后的情势。每日邮报的消息说：代表四十七万工人的工会法律家，已拒绝政府的工资政策，要求对物价与利润施以积极严厉的管制。每日电讯报认为内阁已面临关于这一问题的极严重考验。\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】伦敦讯：英共机关报工人日报，坚决抗议工党政府对劳动人民工资的进攻。该报指出：工党政府制止工资上涨的决定，实际上是否决在一切工业部门中保持工资水平，但厂方的利润和物价却得以日益增涨。该报继称：对劳动人民切身利益的这一进攻，是以制止通货膨胀的胡说来掩饰的。但是工党政府毫未打算增加资本税、削减武装部队、或取缔资本家庞大的利润，来制止这些构成通货膨胀的真正因素。工人日报号召一切职工会会员越发紧密团结起来，反对艾德礼政府对人民生活水平的全面猛攻，以及牺牲工人以增加资本家财富的企图。"

The key points of implementation are as follows: (1) All machine-made or hand-rolled cigarette factories and workshops opened within the Border Region, whether privately, publicly, or cooperatively operated, must cease manufacturing by January 30th. (2) All finished products, whether packaged or unpackaged, must be registered with the local Industry and Commerce Bureau from February 15th to 25th and can be sold on the market. If registration is not applied for after the deadline, it will be treated as illegal cigarette manufacturing, and the cigarettes will be confiscated. (3) After production ceases, the machinery (wooden hand-operated machines shall be disposed of by the factory itself) and raw materials may be purchased by the cigarette company at market prices; those unwilling to sell may retain them. (4) The cigarette tax stamps remaining in the factories and workshops will be repurchased by the Industry and Commerce Bureau at the same price.

    "content": "[News from this newspaper] The marriage issue of Guo Yongliang, a hired laborer from Beixi Jing Village in Wu'an, and Han Lianzhu, based on the current materials, seems like it should have been easily resolved. However, the lawsuit went from the district to the county, and from the county to the Border Region Government, wasting untold work hours and spending countless amounts of money. The government has been dragging its feet for nearly a year, and it remains unresolved.\n\nGuo Yongliang is thirty-six years old this year. He started working as a hired hand at the age of seventeen and worked for sixteen years before ceasing in 1946. His wife, Han Lianzhu, is from Dawangzhai in the Seventh District of Yuanchao, and is twenty-five years old this year. Her original husband, surnamed Yuan, was from Jingyu Village in Wu'an, and was a poor peasant. He starved to death during the famine in 1942. Within seven days, Guo Yongyuan and Guo Bingrong from Beixi Jing introduced Han Lianzhu to Guo Yongliang. At that time, the Wu'an County Government was located in Beixi Jing. Guo Yongliang and the village cadres Shen fu @① and Hao Qingkui went to the county government to complete the procedures. Section Chief Ji Zemin asked if it was voluntary on both sides, and then allowed them to marry. Shen fu @① requested that the procedures be completed. Section Chief Ji said, \"No need. In times of famine, if both people are willing, who can interfere with the marriage? It's nothing.\" They got married on the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar that year.\n\n\tThe district said they couldn't figure it out.\n\tThe county government unjustly ruled for divorce.\n\nOn the first day of the second lunar month last year, Han Lianzhu's mother and uncle went to Beixi Jing and called Han Lianzhu back to Yuanchao. Sanmang and Xiuting also went to their mother's home together. Sanmang and Xiuting's mother's home is in Yaotou Village, Yuanchao. Han Lianzhu stayed at home for six or seven days, then went to Yaotou to invite Sanmang and Xiuting back to Wu'an. They asked her if she was homesick. Han Lianzhu said, \"No, my mother said some inappropriate things that I couldn't stand.\" Because they hadn't finished weaving, they agreed to discuss when to leave at the Dawangzhai fair on the twenty-third day of the second lunar month. They also advised her not to listen to others, saying, \"You're not being mistreated there.\" She said, \"There are no parents-in-law to control me.\" When they went to invite her, she said she wouldn't go back. They asked Xicun (from Gouhe Village, Wu'an), who was visiting relatives there, to send a message to Guo Yongliang. Guo Yongliang went to Dawangzhai to call his wife on the teens of the second lunar month, but Han Lianzhu refused to return.\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the second lunar month, Guo Yongliang returned to Beixi Jing alone. On the twenty-third and fourth, he asked the village chief and political director to write a letter to file a lawsuit in Yuanchao. He first went to the Yuanchao County Government, which introduced him to the Seventh District. The district asked Han Lianzhu to return to Wu'an, but Lianzhu refused, so the district promised to detain her and educate her. At this time, the village cadre stationed by the district government (in Beizhuang) said to Guo Yongliang: \"Fellow villager from Wu'an, she doesn't want to live with you anymore, she is far away from her mother. Give you some money, go back and find another one. You don't need to spend this money here (referring to spending money on lawsuits).\" The villagers also said to Guo Yongliang: \"She won't go back with you. She has found another family and is engaged, right in our village.\" Guo Yongliang asked the district, \"Why was she engaged just because she went to her mother's home?\" The district said \"I don't know.\" Later, he investigated and found that Han Lianzhu's new mother-in-law was delivering food to Lianzhu, and her new husband, Nie Baocun, also went to see her, so no wonder the district didn't ask Guo Yongliang to deliver food. Guo Yongliang saw that the lawsuit was not going well and requested to go to the county government to sue. The district said: \"Let's educate her more.\" Guo Yongliang said: \"I can't afford it, I don't have much money. I have objections to the educational methods.\" He told about the new mother-in-law delivering food and other things. The district said: \"That's not true.\" Later, he was still introduced to the county, and the county wrote a letter asking him to go to the district to resolve it. The district said that the marriage contract between Nie Baocun and Han Lianzhu had been terminated. Lianzhu still refused to leave. At this time, Guo Yongliang was almost out of travel expenses, so he said to the district: \"I can't afford to stay here, I want to return to Wu'an and hand the person over to the government. I will come to ask for her sooner or later.\"\n\nGuo Yongliang went to Yuanchao for the second time on the twenty-seventh and eighth days of the seventh lunar month, with Guo Yongyuan as a companion. He first went to Dawangzhai, but Lianzhu's family did not let him see her. The village chief said: \"If you want to spend some money, just spend some money, she won't go back. It's a loss to keep running back and forth.\" Guo Yongliang did not listen and sued to the county. During the court session, the government personnel said: \"I will definitely ask her (Lianzhu) to go with you.\" Just as he said this, he asked Guo Yongliang to go down. It turned out that the village cadre from Dawangzhai had arrived. After a while, the government personnel changed their tune again, saying that they wanted to improve women and ruled that Guo Yongliang and Han Lianzhu should be divorced. If he was not satisfied, he should appeal to the Linqing Commissioner's Office. Guo Yongliang was in difficulty for a long time before he came out with the judgment. He wanted to appeal to the Commissioner's Office, but he didn't have travel expenses, so he had to go home.\n\nAfter returning home, Guo Yongliang said: He felt depressed. He had spent a lot of money at the beginning, and this time he spent another twenty or thirty thousand, but he didn't find out the \"reason.\" One day, he met Guo Yushi, the deputy county chief of Wu'an (who was recuperating in Xijing), and asked him to write a letter. On the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, he filed a complaint with the Border Region Government. Wei Zetong, the chief of the social affairs section, said that he would write a letter to Yuanchao to see what was going on. After about a month, he went to the Border Region Government again, but he didn't see Chief Wei, so he made a wasted trip. Twenty or thirty days later, he found Chief Wei. Chief Wei said: \"Let me send you another letter.\" He went to the Border Region Government for the fourth time, but there was still no result.\n\nOne day, Zhou Jifang (according to Guo Yongliang, he was a county political commissar) who was recuperating in Xijing, learned about Guo Yongliang's affairs and wrote a letter to Meng Futang, the director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, and Minister Guo (whose name he didn't know), who were meeting in ×× Village, asking Guo Yongliang to talk to them. According to Guo Yongliang: \"When I arrived at ×× Village, the sentry passed the letter in and asked me to wait. When the meeting was dismissed, it was almost dark, and Director Meng left. I went to the ×× Village where he lived. I searched for a long time before I found him. He asked me what was the matter? I said, \"Have you seen a letter?\" He asked: \"Where are you from?\" I said: \"Xijing, Wu'an.\" He asked: \"Who sent the letter?\" I said: \"Political Commissar Zhou.\" He asked: \"Which Political Commissar Zhou? I don't know.\" I said: \"I don't know either.\" He said: \"I haven't seen the letter.\" I said: \"Can the sentry suppress our letter?\" He said: \"I don't know if it's suppressed. What is your business?\" I said: \"The lawsuit issue in Yuanchao County.\" He asked: \"Didn't you lose?\" I said: \"How do you know that the lawsuit in Yuanchao County was lost if you haven't received the letter? Was the verdict in Yuanchao County your idea?\" He said: \"The problem in Yuanchao County still has to go back to Yuanchao County. I am here for a meeting, not to solve your problem. Go back to Jinnan to solve it.\" I said: \"It doesn't matter if it can't be solved, it doesn't matter if you haven't seen the letter. Give me a return slip so I can go back.\" He said: \"Can I give you a road pass when I'm in a meeting?\" I said: \"What should I do? Then I'll just roast by the stove all night.\" He said: \"I don't care if you roast. We have two or three hundred people from Jinnan here, it's too crowded.\"\n\nGuo Yongliang said: Director Meng of the Jinnan Administrative Office doesn't care enough about us.\n\nAccording to Guo Yongliang, he was very dissatisfied that Director Meng was not concerned about him, and finally gave him a road pass. Guo Yongliang said: \"When I came out, it was dark in the middle of the night, and I was walking aimlessly. I thought about it and went to the village chief. The village chief was initially unwilling to keep me. Later, he asked about my background and history, and said: \"We are basically the same people, some are slow to treat.\" So he took me to Li Xiukui's house to lie down for a night.\"\n\nOn the first few days of the twelfth lunar month, Guo Yongliang went to the Border Region Government for the fifth time. Chief Wei said that he had sent a telegram to the Jinnan Administrative Office and that his problem would be dealt with in at most ten or twenty days. On January 12th of this year, Guo Yongliang went to the Border Region Government for the sixth time. Chief Wei said: \"A telegram was sent but there was no reply. Let me send you another telegram.\"\n\n(This material was discussed by Guo Yongliang with this newspaper, and this newspaper wrote it on his behalf.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 雇工郭永亮韩莲珠一件婚姻问题  政府拖了一年没解决  误工费钱·应检查官僚主义\n\n1948-02-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    雇工郭永亮韩莲珠一件婚姻问题\n    政府拖了一年没解决\n    误工费钱·应检查官僚主义\n    【本报消息】武安北西井村雇工郭永亮，和韩莲珠的婚姻问题，根据现在的材料来看，问题本来是容易解决的；可是官司从区打到县，从县打到边府，误了不知多少工，花了不知多少钱，政府拖来拖去，将近一年，始终没解决。\n    郭永亮今年三十六岁，从十七岁给人家当长工，当了十六年，民国三十五年才下工。他老婆韩莲珠，元朝七区大王寨人，今年二十五岁。原夫姓袁，武安井峪村人，是贫农。三十一年闹灾荒饿死。没过七天，北西井郭永元、郭丙荣就给郭永亮介绍韩莲珠。当时武安县政府住在北西井，郭永亮和本村干部申ｆǔ＠①、郝庆魁到县府办手续。科长纪泽民问了问是两家自愿，就让他们结婚。申ｆǔ＠①要求办办手续。纪科长说：“不用。灾荒年头，两个人都愿意，谁还能干涉婚姻？没啥事。”当年旧历五月二十七日他俩结了婚。\n  区上说是摸不清楚  县府平白判决离婚\n    去年旧历前二月初一，韩莲珠的母亲和舅舅到北西井，叫韩莲珠回了元朝。当时一块走娘家的还有三忙和秀亭。三忙和秀亭的娘家，是元朝窑头村。韩莲珠到家住了六、七天，到窑头约三忙、秀亭回武安。她俩问她是不是想家？韩莲珠说：“不是，俺娘说了些不对头的话，我听不过。”她俩因为没织完布，约定旧历二月二十三日大王寨会上再商量什么时候走。还劝她别听人家的话，说：“你在那里又不被屈。”她说：“又没有公公婆婆管着我。”等到去约她的时候，她又说不走了。她俩就托在那里走亲戚的喜存（武安沟河村人）给郭永亮捎了个信。郭永亮就在旧历后二月十几日到大王寨叫老婆，韩莲珠说啥也不回来。\n    旧历后二月十九，郭永亮一个人回到北西井。二十三、四日，找村长政治主任写了信，到元朝打官司去。先到了元朝县政府，县府介绍到七区。区上让韩莲珠回武安，莲珠说啥也不走，区上答应押起来教育她。这时，区公所住村（北庄）的村干部对郭永亮说：“武安老乡，人家不愿意跟你过日子啦，离她娘远。给你几个钱，回去另寻一个吧。你不用在这里花这个钱，（指打官司花钱）啦。”村上老百姓也对郭永亮说：“她不跟你回去啦，人家寻了婆家啦，订了婚啦，就在俺这村。”郭永亮追问区上“为啥来串娘家就给订了婚”？区上说“摸不清楚”。后来他一调查，韩莲珠新找的婆婆给莲珠送饭，新丈夫聂保存也去看她，怪不得区上不叫郭永亮送饭。郭永亮看这官司不对劲，要求到县政府去打。区上说：“再教育教育她吧。”郭永亮说：“我熬不起，盘缠少。我对教育方法有意见。”他就把新婆婆送饭等事情说了说。区上说：“没有的事。”后来还是给介绍到了县上，县上又写信叫到区上解决。区上说已经解除了聂保存和韩莲珠的婚约。莲珠还是不走。这时，郭永亮已快没了路费，就对区上说：“我在这里熬不起啦，我要回武安，把人交给政府，我早晚来要人。”\n    郭永亮二回下元朝，是旧历七月二十七、八日，和郭永元带伴去的。先到了大王寨，莲珠家没叫见人。村长来说：“你要使个钱儿，就使个钱儿，人家不回去啦。来回跑，受损失。”郭永亮不听，告到了县上。过堂的时候，政府的人员说：“我一定叫她（莲珠）跟你。”刚说到这里，就叫郭永亮下去。原来大王寨的村干部来了。停了一会，政府人员又变了挂，说要提高妇女，判决郭永亮和韩莲珠离婚，要不服，就到临清专署上诉。郭永亮犯了半天难为，才拿着判决书出来。想到专署上诉，没有路费了，只好回家。\n    回家以后，郭永亮说：心头闷倦，起先就花了不少钱，这回又花了两三万，也没闹出个“原因”。有一天他见了武安副县长郭雨时（在西井养病），叫他给写了一封信，旧历八月十五到边府告了一状。社会科长魏泽同说给元朝写封信看看。过了月把子，他又去边府，没见到魏科长，白跑了一趟。又过了二十多天，找到了魏科长。魏科长说：“再给你去封信吧。”第四趟去边府，还是没有结果。\n    有一天，在西井休养的周继方（据郭永亮说是个县政委），知道了郭永亮的事情，就给正在××村开会的冀南行署主任孟夫唐、郭部长（不知道名字）写了封信，让郭永亮找他们谈谈。据郭永亮说：“我到了××村，站岗的把信传进去，叫我等着。散会的时候，天快黑了，孟主任走了。我又到了他住的××村。找了半天才找到他。他问我什么事？我说：“有封信你见了吗？”他问：“你是哪里的？”我说：“武安西井。”他问：“送的谁的信？”我说：“周政委的。”他问：“哪一个周政委？”我说：“周继方。”他说：“哪一个周继方？我不知道。”我说：“我也不知道。”他说：“我没有见信。”我说：“站岗的还能压咱封信？”他说：“压不压我不知道。你是什么事？”我说：“元朝县的官司问题。”他问：“你不是输了吗？”我说：“你没接到信怎么知道元朝县的官司输了？元朝县的判决是你的主意？”他说：“元朝县的问题还得回元朝县，我来这里开会来嘛，不是解决你这问题，你回冀南解决。”我说：“不能解决也没啥，信见不见也没啥，你给我开个回条我回去吧。”他说：“我开会还能给你开路条？”我说：“怎么办？我今天就在大灶上烤一黑夜吧。”他说：“你烤不烤我不管。我们冀南来了二三百号人，挤得着不下。”\n  郭永亮表示：冀南行署孟主任对咱们不够关心\n    据郭永亮表示，孟主任对他不够关心，他很不满意，直到最后才给他开了个路条。郭永亮说：“我出来，黑地半夜，没头走，思想了一下，找村长吧，村长开头不愿意留我。后来问了我的出身历史，说：“都是基本上人，有些慢待。”就领我到李秀魁家躺了一夜。”\n    旧历十二月初几，郭永亮第五遭去边府，魏科长说是打电报给冀南行署了，顶多在宽一二十天就处理他的问题。今年一月十二日，郭永亮第六遭去边府，魏科长说：“打了个电报没来回信，再给你打个电报吧。”\n    （这个材料是郭永亮来本报谈的，本报为他代笔。）"

Gao Ru Jin is over sixty years old this year. He worked as a hired laborer for forty years and only has two dilapidated houses. After Gaoyi was liberated after the Japanese surrender, he was no longer a hired laborer. After he turned over a new leaf, someone introduced him to a wife who was a target of struggle. The woman is already in her thirties. Since they got married last year, she hasn't slept with Ru Jin once. She doesn't call Ru Jin \"Dad\" with her two children, nor does she speak to him. This year, they harvested twenty bags of wheat, and autumn looks promising too, but now his wife has taken everything, and he is extremely worried. Kong Fenglin is forty years old this year and has eight acres of bad land. He has been herding sheep since he was a child. He married the wife of a target of struggle, and she ate up all the wages he earned, leaving him in poverty and hardship. Since last year, his wife hasn't made him any socks, shoes, or clothes. She doesn't make him anything. In Xizhang Village, First District, there is a poor hired laborer named Zhang Xinfu. In the past, his family of three had nine fen of land. After the mass movement, he found a landlord's daughter as a partner. They lived well after they got married, but this year she heard that landlords would also get a share of land, and she immediately changed and stopped living properly. Zhang Xinfu is sick, and she doesn't care about him. She doesn't ask him whether he eats or not.

The traitorous landlord Yan Haiju of Xiaositang relied on the Japanese and killed three basic masses, embezzling a lot of money from the people. After Wu'an was liberated, the masses detained him and struggled against him. During the night, they didn't pay attention, and Yan Haiju ran away, leaving his woman and three children at home. The village militia captain, Ma Bingxing, came from a hired labor background. On April 9th last year, he married this woman. Last September, Ma Bingxing led the militia to participate in the war in northern Henan. On October 17th, Yan Haiju ran back and abducted the woman, and also took away the clothes Ma Bingxing had earned from eight years of long-term labor and the fruits and clothes distributed by the Farmers' Association, a total of twenty pieces.\n              (Kong Fanxiang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 高邑武城等村反映  地主女人心没变  和她结婚吃大亏\n久来  西张村通讯组  孔繁祥\n1948-02-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    高邑武城等村反映\n    地主女人心没变\n    和她结婚吃大亏\n    【高邑消息】本县四区武城村高如金与地主女人结婚上了当。高如金今年六十余岁了，他当了四十年雇工，家里就有两间破房子，别的什么也没有。日本投降，高邑解放以后，不当雇工了，翻身后即有人给他说了个老婆，是斗争对象。女人已有三十余岁，从去年结婚到现在，未和如金睡一回觉，带着两个小孩也不叫如金爹，也不说话。今年打麦子二十布袋，秋天又是好年景，现在叫老婆都弄光了，愁的不行。孔奉林今年四十岁了，家里有八亩坏地，从小放羊到现在。娶了斗争对象的老婆，把赚的工资给吃光了，受了穷，紧的不行。去年到现在老婆没有给他做过袜鞋衣服，什么也不给做。一区西张村有个贫雇叫张新福，过去家里三口人，九分地，群运后找了个地主闺女作为对象，才结婚过的倒也不错，今年她听说地主也同样分一份地，立刻改变了，不好好过了。张新福病了，她也不答理，吃饭不吃饭她也不问。（久来、西张村通讯组）\n    【武安消息】武安小寺堂村民兵队长马秉兴，和地主女人结了婚，结果叫她咬了一口，把他分的果实和自己的衣服共二十件都拐走了。小寺堂汉奸地主阎海举，曾经依靠日本人，害死三个基本群众，贪污了老百姓很多钱。武安解放后，群众把他扣起，向他斗争。夜里没有注意，阎海举跑了，把女人和三个小孩丢在家里。村里的民兵队长马秉兴是雇工出身，在去年四月九日和这个女人结了婚。去年九月，马秉兴带民兵到豫北参战，十月十七日，阎海举跑回来，把这个女人拐走，还把马秉兴扛长活八年赚的衣裳和农会分的果实衣服共二十件，都拐走了。\n              （孔繁祥）"

    "content": "[Taihang News] Bad cadres such as the village chief of Zhang Ergou Village in the Third District of Neiqiu used various means to threaten, bully, and suppress hired and poor peasants, forcing them to urgently request withdrawal from the poor and hired peasant groups. Since the promulgation of the Land Law, the leadership has emphasized that \"poor and hired peasants should be in power,\" and the district organized a poor and hired peasant group in the village in isolation. From then on, village chief Liang Niu Zi (a bankrupt landlord who still hires long-term laborers) and Wu Weihui Director and Public Security Officer Li Bao Fu (who still hires long-term laborers) were very dissatisfied and deliberately played with \"hired and poor peasants in power\" everywhere to threaten and suppress poor and hired peasants. Whenever there was work in the village, they forced it onto the poor and hired peasant group. For example, this time the county issued four types of winter production statistical forms, and the Wu Weihui director insisted that the poor and hired peasant group be responsible for them. The poor peasant Li Lao Jin said: \"You have given all of these to us, but we are all from backgrounds of carrying long-term labor and herding cattle and sheep. How can we do this?!\" The Wu Weihui director said: \"I knew you couldn't take power, not even fill out a form or classify your class status; who told you to spend other people's loans?!\" This made the seven poor and hired peasant households in the poor and hired peasant group burdened and worried all day long. They reflected that the district's organization of the poor and hired peasant group had harmed them. When the masses in the village had any problems, they went to the cadres, who shirked responsibility, saying: \"Now that the poor and hired peasants are in charge, what dare the cadres say? Go find them!\" However, when Li Hao Shan of the poor and hired peasant group wanted to go to his sister's house, the village chief refused to issue a road pass. This constantly made the poor and hired peasants feel aggrieved and worried them. They complained: \"Joining the group has caused trouble. In the past, we suffered from hunger and hardship, but that was still a natural misfortune.\" In addition, the village chief also used old clan threats at the poor and hired peasant meeting, saying: \"From now on, you will be in charge! If you have a big opinion of me, I won't be able to be a cadre, and you will have to be governed by Liu Jia Zhuang (Liu Jia Zhuang and Zhang Er Gou used to be an administrative village, but because Liu Jia Zhuang village was large, the large village suppressed the small village, and the masses of Zhang Er Gou were afraid of being bullied in the past); if you have a smaller opinion of me, we several cadres can still serve, and people from this village are always closer to people from this village.\" This frightened the poor and hired peasants even more. Recently, Comrades Wang Shou Xin and Ning Zhi Jian from the county construction section came to the village to inspect work. When they visited the hired and poor peasants, the hired and poor peasants responded perfunctorily: \"Life is not bad! Now we can all turn ourselves around!\" When Wang and others suggested that the hired and poor peasants should take power and lead the land reform in the future, Li Hao Shan, a sixty-two-year-old bachelor hired peasant, said: \"I have food and drink, no matter what, don't let me join the poor and hired peasant group.\" At this time, he burst into tears, asking to be expelled from the poor and hired peasant group immediately. The other six hired and poor peasant households also pleaded to withdraw from the group. When Comrade Shou Xin visited Li Er Gou's family, a hired peasant who had not yet turned himself around, Er Gou said at first: \"In the past, when district cadres came, they all went to the cadres' homes, but now they only come to my house. After you leave, the village cadres don't know how they will bully me!\" After in-depth and patient interviews, the above-mentioned criminal acts of the village cadres threatening and bullying the hired and poor peasants were discovered. Finally, Er Gou repeatedly instructed Comrade Wang: \"Be sure not to tell the village chief, if he knows, I won't be able to eat well after you leave!\" Comrades Shou Xin and Zhi Jian continued to investigate hardships and found that among the seven hired and poor peasants in the poor and hired peasant group, three had been subjected to unreasonable struggles last year. Li Hao Shan was forced by the cadres to divide his seven persimmon trees and \"forcefully exchange\" them for two acres of land; Li Cai Xiao, a long-term laborer, increased the wages of the landlord Bu Shi He by three dou of wheat, but the cadres forcibly carried away two dou; Er Gou's wife often quarreled with him because she thought he was wasteful, and the cadres falsely accused her of disrupting production, brought her to a general meeting to be struggled against, and the child cried when he saw his mother being detained, and the child was also locked in a confinement room. After Wang and Ning discovered these problems, they resolutely stated that \"we must support everyone (hired and poor peasants) and be the masters,\" and at the same time, they deeply mobilized the hired and poor peasants, preparing to remove this stone slab.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不依靠贫雇团结中农的教训  内邱张耳沟自上而下搞贫雇组  受干部打击给贫雇背包袱  各地应坚决停止这种形式主义作法\n\n1948-02-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    不依靠贫雇团结中农的教训\n    内邱张耳沟自上而下搞贫雇组\n    受干部打击给贫雇背包袱\n    各地应坚决停止这种形式主义作法\n    【太行消息】内邱三区张耳沟村长等坏干部，使用种种手段威胁、欺侮、压制雇贫，迫使雇贫迫切要求退出贫雇小组。自公布土地法后，领导上强调提出“贫雇要当权领导”，区上并到该村孤立的组织了一个贫雇小组。从此村长梁牛子（破落地主，现在还雇长工）、武委会主任兼公安员李保福（还雇着长工）非常不满，处处拿“雇贫当权”来故意玩弄、威胁、压制贫雇。村里有啥工作都硬往雇贫小组身上推，比如这次县里发下四种冬季生产统计表，武委会主任拿着硬叫贫雇小组负责弄。贫雇李老金说：“你们都给了俺，俺都是些扛长工、放牛羊出身，怎能弄了这个？！”武委会主任就说：“知道你们就掌不了权，连个表也不会填，阶层也不会划；谁叫你们花人家贷款哩？！”闹得贫雇小组的七户贫雇背了大包袱，整天发愁，反映区里组织贫雇小组是害了他们。村里群众有啥问题去找干部，他们一退六二五的说：“现在贫雇当家作主，干部敢说啥？去找人家吧！”但是贫雇小组的李好山要到他姐姐家时，村长却不给开路条。这样整天逼得贫雇受气，可愁坏啦，他们埋怨说：“参加了组，可惹下祸啦，以前挨饿受罪吧，也还是受个自然罪。”另外，村长还在贫雇会上利用旧时的宗派威胁说：“从今以后，就叫你们作主哇！你们要对俺意见大了，俺的干部当不上，你们就得归人家刘家庄管（刘家庄和张耳沟在过去是一个行政村，因刘家庄村大，大村压小村，旧时把张耳沟群众欺侮怕了）；要对俺意见小些，我们这几个干部还可当，本村人总是亲本村人”。这一说，更把贫雇吓唬住了。最近县建设科王守信、宁志坚两同志到该村检查工作，找雇贫访时光，雇贫应付说：“生活不赖！现在都可翻转身啦！”王等提出贫雇当权将来领导土地改革时，六十二岁的老雇贫光棍李好山说：“我有吃有喝，你们不管怎也不要叫俺参加贫雇组啦”。这时他大哭起来，要求马上开除他出贫雇组。其他六户雇贫也纷纷恳求退组。守信同志到现在还没翻透身的雇贫李二苟家访问时，开头二苟说：“以前区干部来了都到干部家，现在来了光到俺家，你们走了，人家村干部不知怎么欺侮俺哩！”经过深入耐心访问，才发现村干部上述威胁、欺侮雇贫的罪恶行为。最后，二苟再三吩咐王同志说：“当紧不要向村长说，让人家知道了，你们走后，俺可是吃不倒呀！”守信、志坚两同志继续访苦，又发现贫雇小组里的七户雇贫，就有三户在去年挨过无理的斗争；李好山是让干部强分了他七棵柿树，“硬换”给他二亩地；李才小住长工，向地主卜石河增加了三斗麦的工资，干部硬给扛走二斗；二苟家老婆，因嫌二苟浪费常常吵架，干部诬说是她捣乱生产，把二苟老婆弄到大会上斗了一顿，孩子见扣起他娘就大哭起来，把孩子也关到禁闭房。王、宁二同志发现上面这些问题后，一面坚决表明“一定要给大家（雇贫）撑腰作主”，一面深入发动雇贫，准备揭掉这块石板。"

Li Hetian (deputy director of the Armed Committee), a poor peasant and hired laborer, had just returned from a meeting in the county to study the Land Law when Wang Yuansheng, the director of the Armed Committee, bought him some cigarettes, intending to bribe him and get him to cover up some of the bad things he had done in the past. He also colluded with the political director, the public security director, the chairman of the farmers' association, and Li Xiaojie (a poor peasant and hired laborer who attended the meeting in the county) to form a fake poor peasant league. When organizing it, they did not absorb the real poor peasants and hired laborers, but instead had Li Huiku (a middle peasant), the political director's uncle, participate, suppressing the poor peasants and hired laborers to the point where they did not dare to speak. Wang Yuansheng also saw the news of returning the fruits [of land reform] and, fearing that the masses would reason with him, he preemptively returned home and colluded with his mother to offer some bad land. He also attempted to sabotage the unity of the poor and middle peasants and the Land Law by colluding with the middle peasants. He said to the old middle peasant Fu Wentian: \"The Land Law is here! It will be divided equally. Eat quickly, or you won't be able to eat after the division. If you don't eat, you're just preparing it for others.\" He also said to the middle peasant He Qi: \"The mule you are feeding is no longer yours.\" This frightened the middle peasants. The political director, the director of the Armed Committee, the public security director, and the chairman of the farmers' association also used family relationships to divide the unity of the poor peasants. Later, Wang Songling, a cadre from the county, came to the village, disbanded the fake poor peasant league, and found the real poor peasants and hired laborers Li Futian and Shuda's mother, separately communicating with them to convene poor peasant and hired laborer meetings to discuss the Land Law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 仵桥村干部错上加错  搞假贫农团破坏土地法\n\n1948-02-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    仵桥村干部错上加错\n    搞假贫农团破坏土地法\n    【太行消息】黎城二区仵桥村武委会主任等坏干部，组织假贫农团，破坏贫中农团结，企图掩盖自己的过错。贫雇李河田（武委会副主任）在县里开会研究土地法刚回来，武委会主任王远生就给他买了些纸烟，打算收买他，想叫把他自己过去办的坏事包庇住些。他并拉拢了政治主任、公安主任、农会主席和李孝节（在县开会的贫雇）等，组织假贫农团。在组织时，不把真正贫雇吸收进来，反叫政治主任的叔叔李会库（中农）参加了，把贫雇农打击的连话也不敢说。王远生又看见退果实消息，怕群众和他讲理，就投机先回家和他娘说通，献些坏地。他还企图破坏贫中农团结，破坏土地法，拉拢中农和自己一气。他给旧中农傅文田说：“土地法下来啦！要平分哩，你快吃吧，分了就吃不开啦，不吃还不是给人家预备哩。”又给中农贺旗说：“你喂的骡子不是你的了。”弄得中农都害了怕。政治主任、武委会主任、公安主任、农会主席，也利用家族关系，分裂贫农团结。后来县里干部王松令到村后，将假贫农团解散，并找到了真正贫雇李甫田、树达娘二人，分别串通召开贫雇会，讨论土地法。"

    "content": "Neiqiu Organizes Large-Scale Publicity for Market Fairs\n\n    Since the publication of the Outline Land Law in the newspaper, in addition to transferring county and district cadres to go deep into the countryside to cooperate with village cadres in publicizing the Land Law, cadres in government offices have also organized publicity in the local area. Cadres and teachers from institutions such as the county government, the county committee, the public security bureau, the county cooperative, and the Second Higher Primary School organized publicity activities on the 25th and 28th days of the twelfth lunar month (market days), which achieved great results. A total of seven groups were organized, with one person in each group responsible for explaining, and the other comrades dispersed among the crowd to listen to feedback. The focus of the publicity was: (1) to make the masses understand that the Outline Land Law is the best policy to completely eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitation, meet the demands of the poor and hired peasants, and thoroughly become masters of their own affairs; (2) to explain that it is necessary to resolutely unite with the middle peasants during the equal distribution and dispel the middle peasants' ideological doubts; (3) to prevent and expose the sabotage of landlords and rich peasants and overcome waste, and to maintain normal production; and to cite examples of criminal facts of sabotaging the Land Law in the county to advise listeners not to repeat the same mistakes. More than 10,000 people attended the market on both of these days. As soon as they heard that the Land Law Outline was being promoted, they listened quietly to the explanations, and some even sat down automatically. On North Street, a man in his thirties approached the propagandist and said, \"We must go and listen to the Land Law explanation.\" Another old man went to listen with wide eyes and a grin. In the South Gate pig market, people were very scattered. When the propagandist first started speaking, only a few dozen people were listening, but as soon as they heard that it was about the Outline Land Law, more and more people gathered, and after the speech, they asked for it to be repeated. When the propagandist asked for listeners' opinions, an old man said: \"No one in the village can explain what the Land Law is saying. Everyone thought it was 'communization' and that middle peasants would be struggled against! After this explanation, I understand, and there is nothing to be afraid of.\" Two people in their forties and fifties from Luting Village said together: \"Cadres should not take or touch the fruits they get.\" Some people said, \"This is great. After the equal distribution, everyone will have land, and we will have food and clothing to produce properly.\" After listening to the speech, an old man from Fugou went to the county bank to talk about the equal distribution of land. He said, \"No one talks about it in the village, and no one understands. Everyone thought that the middle peasants would inevitably be struggled against in this distribution. I wanted to ask the village cadres, but I was afraid of being accused of sabotage. I understood it at the market today; it's not about struggling against the middle peasants.\" After the comrades in the bank inquired, they learned that he was a middle peasant. An old woman attending the market laughed when she heard Comrade Cheng Shengkui of the County Committee talk about how some middle peasants thought that the equal distribution was a random division, and that they did not even dare to transport manure to the fields. This was a misunderstanding of the Land Law. After Comrade Cheng finished speaking, the masses applauded and supported him.

    "content": "After the publication of documents such as the Land Law Outline, the Letter to Peasants, and the Letter to Party Members, many cadres and Party members who had made mistakes showed good behavior. They realized that their past actions, such as taking too much fruit, shielding landlords, etc., were wrong. They said, \"We did get more of the fruit in the past, and we have to return it to the people. If our attitude is not good, we have to change it and not push it onto others.\" They didn't indulge in excessive eating and drinking, and expressed their willingness to bow their heads to the masses and admit their mistakes. Although this is only the beginning of recognizing their mistakes, and correcting them will require a good process of self-awareness, we believe that this is the minimum attitude that cadres and Party members should have in implementing the Land Law Outline. However, many cadres are not like this. They \"knowingly violate the law,\" secretly transferring property and indulging in excessive eating and drinking. Some even openly collude with and intimidate poor peasants and hired laborers, organizing fake \"Poor Peasants Associations\" to suppress the poor peasants and hired laborers on the one hand and cover up their mistakes to higher authorities on the other. In addition, village cadres hide newspapers reporting on the Land Law, preventing the masses from seeing them. In Xiyang, some district cadres even detained newspapers and prohibited the masses from reading them, citing the excuse of fearing that it would hinder mass production. In Qinyang, one district prohibited the publicity of the Land Law. We have already received reports from correspondents and telegrams from branch offices about such incidents occurring in more than twenty counties. In many places, the above-mentioned destructive behaviors have been correctly stopped, but in some places, the leadership had previously adopted a laissez-faire attitude, failing to actively expose or stop the acts of sabotaging the Land Law among the masses, and sitting idly by as mistakes expanded. Recently, there have been instances of simply detaining and punishing people, thinking that detention alone can stop it. We believe that acts of sabotaging the Land Law must be resolutely and effectively stopped, and no carelessness should be allowed. Local experiences have proven that the best way to stop this is to use the Letter to Party Members, the Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against the Land Law, and the Letter to Peasants as the main weapons to actively educate the peasants and cadres, mobilize the masses to stop acts of sabotaging the Land Law, and at the same time, educate cadres not to repeat their mistakes, to make them understand the greater righteousness, to point out a way out, and to make them honestly listen to the people's judgment. Necessary punishment should be given to certain individual bad cadres who are incorrigible and deeply hated by the masses, \"punishing one as a warning to a hundred.\" The example of Tian Erzhuang in Wu'an, where the bad village chief who sabotaged the Land Law was removed from his post, made the cadres in the surrounding villages honest. This kind of necessary punishment must be combined with mobilizing the broad masses of peasants to spontaneously stop the sabotage of the Land Law and with patient and in-depth education work to be more effective. Therefore, we hope that all localities will conduct an inspection to more effectively stop all acts of sabotaging the Land Law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 再不要在人民面前犯罪了！\n\n1948-02-16\n第1版()\n专栏：社论\n\n    再不要在人民面前犯罪了！\n    土地法大纲、告农民书、告党员书等文件发表后，不少犯了错的干部、党员表现还好，他们知道了自己过去多占果实，包庇地主……等行为是错误的，他们说：“果实过去咱们就是得的多，得给老百姓退。态度不好，就得改，不能往上边推。”他们不大吃大喝，表示向群众低头、认错，虽然这才只是开始知错，要改错还要经过很好的自觉过程，但我们认为，这是干部党员执行土地法大纲起码的态度。也有不少干部不是如此，他们是“知法犯法”，暗地转移财产，大吃大喝；有的竟公然拉拢与威吓贫雇，组织假“贫农团”，想一手压住贫雇，一手向上级掩盖错误。此外村干把登土地法的报纸藏起来，不让群众看，昔阳甚至还有的区干部借口害怕妨碍群众生产，扣押报纸，禁止群众读。沁阳有一个区禁止宣传土地法。我们已收到的通讯员稿件及分社来电中，已有二十余县发生这类事件。不少地方对以上种种破坏行为是正确制止了，但还有些地方，在领导上，前一个时期是采取放任自流态度，对破坏土地法的事不去积极的在群众中公开揭破或制止，坐视错误扩大，到了最近又发生有单纯扣押惩办的现象，以为扣押了就可以制止了。我们觉得对破坏土地法行为必须坚决的有效的制止，绝不允许丝毫马虎。这种制止办法各地经验证明最好是以告党员书，破坏土地法治罪条例，告农民书为主要武器，在农民中在干部党员中积极的进行教育，发动群众制止破坏土地法的行为，同时教育干部不要一错再错，错上加错，晓以大义，指给出路，使其老老实实听候人民处理。对于某些个别怙恶不悛为群众所十分痛恨的坏干部给以必要的惩办，“惩一儆百”也是应该的。武安田二庄把破坏土地法的坏村长撤了职，影响周围各村干部都老实起来，便是一个好例子。这种必要的惩办必须同发动广大农民自动起来制止破坏土地法，同耐心深入教育工作结合起来，才更有力量。因此我们希望各地做一检查，以便更有效的制止一切破坏土地法行为。"

The factory was located in Xinfeng Town, Taipei (newly established county east of Taipei), with sixteen spinning machines, seventy-five horsepower, one thousand one hundred and sixty spindles, and more than one hundred and thirty workers, producing thirty-two pieces of cloth per day. During the Kuomintang bandit \"sweep\" to the town, the factory buildings and machines were all burned down, the materials were looted, and most of the workers were taken away. The 淮南 Cotton Mill was established by national capitalist Cai Maolin in May 1945. In September of the same year, our army liberated the town, and the democratic government implemented a policy of protecting industry and commerce, lending 1 million Central China currency to support it. After the ban on the import of American goods, the factory became even more prosperous, and its products sold well in the liberated areas of northern Jiangsu, central Jiangsu, and Shandong. After the Kuomintang bandits occupied Xinfeng Town in December of the year before last, bandit leader and pacification commander Li Mo'an forcibly \"seized\" it in the name of the Ministry of National Defense, a total of three times, until all the funds were looted and the factory shut down. Last April, the town was liberated again, and the factory, which had been shut down for four months, quickly resumed production with the assistance of the democratic government. This time, it was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华中蒋匪烧毁民营淮南纱厂\n\n1948-02-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    华中蒋匪烧毁民营淮南纱厂\n    【新华社华东十四日电】曾为蒋匪“劫收”歇业而为民主政府扶助复工的华中民营淮南纱厂，在上月中旬东台等地蒋匪垂死“扫荡”中，再次为其全部烧毁。该厂设于台北（新设县东台北部）新丰镇，计有十六架纺纱机，七十五匹马力，一千一百六十个纱锭，一百三十余工人，日出布三十二匹。此次蒋匪“扫荡”至该镇时，将该厂房屋机器全部烧毁，物资悉数抢光，工人大部捉去。按淮南纱厂为民族资本家蔡茂林等于三十四年五月所筹办，是年九月我军解放该镇，民主政府执行保护工商业政策，曾贷华中币一百万元予以扶植。禁止美货输入后，该厂更形发达，出品畅销于苏北、苏中、山东各解放区。前年十二月蒋匪侵占新丰镇后，匪首绥靖司令李默庵即以国防部名义强行“劫收”，先后共三次，直至全部资金被劫光停业。去年四月该镇再次为我解放，已停工四个月的该厂在民主政府协助下，迅速复工，此次竟为蒋匪摧毁。"

    "content": "Fully Accepting Readers' Suggestions\n    Changzhi Post Office Changes its Style\n    To the Editors:\n    We received the criticism made by the People's Daily on the 1st of this month (referring to the \"Criticism and Suggestions\" of \"Post Office Should Accommodate the People's Time\"), and we immediately held a meeting for self-criticism. We believe that giving us this criticism is completely correct and also very necessary. Our attitude is to sincerely accept this important criticism and valuable suggestion. Indeed, in our past work, we implemented a Monday rest system and stipulated office hours from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, using leisure time and rest days to sort out unfinished matters. This approach actually only considered our own difficulties of being busy with few staff, without a comprehensive approach, resulting in much inconvenience to the masses. During this self-criticism, we recalled that in the past, our attitude, words, and actions towards the masses in our work were indeed inappropriate in some areas. For example, on rest days and after office hours, when we encountered people coming to send letters, we often said to them: \"Today is a rest day, we don't accept letters.\" \"Office hours are over, we don't accept letters…\" Although we still accepted the letters in this situation, the people must have been dissatisfied upon hearing this. We feel that this dissatisfaction is completely justified. Because today's post office is the people's own post office, and our cadres are servants who serve the people. However, in our self-criticism, we deeply felt that some aspects were indeed similar to the style of the old post office. We are determined to change these bad working styles from today onwards. We have completely abolished the past working system that did not meet the needs of the masses and changed it to accepting letters at any time. We have also immediately and resolutely canceled rest days and changed to daily office hours. Although our working style and system have begun to change today, we still hope that the masses from all sides will offer more opinions to help us improve.\n                  Changzhi Post Office\n    Editor's Note: This self-criticism by the Changzhi Post Office is very good. This spirit of courageously accepting the opinions of the masses and resolutely correcting shortcomings should be promoted. But there are still some agencies, organizations, and individuals who have not responded to the opinions raised about them in the newspaper. This is bureaucracy. We hope to correct it immediately.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 完全接受读者建议  长治邮局改变作风\n长治邮政局\n1948-02-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    完全接受读者建议\n    长治邮局改变作风\n    编辑同志：\n    我们接到本月一日人民日报给我们提出的批评意见（指“邮局应该凑老百姓的时间”的“批评与建议”），马上就开会作检讨。我们认为这样给我们提出批评是完全正确，也是非常必要的一件事。我们的态度是诚恳的接受这一重要批评和宝贵意见。的确我们在过去工作中实行星期一的休息制度，与每日上午九点至下午四点的办公时间的规定，来利用业余时间和休息日整理未办事宜，这样的做法，实际是单纯照顾了我们事多人少忙不过来的困难，没有全面的出发，结果给了群众许多的不方便。在这次检讨工作中，我们回想到过去在工作上，对群众的态度，言语、行动有些地方的确是不合适的。如我们在休息日和下办公时间后，遇到群众来送信时，常好给群众说：今日休息哩，不收信。下了办公啦，不收信…。在这个情况下，虽说也收下了信件，但群众听了，一定不满。我们感到这种不满也是完全对的。因为今天的邮局是群众自己的邮局，我们的干部是为群众服务的勤务员。但我们在检讨中，深深的感到有些地方的确和过去旧邮局的作风差不多。这些不好的工作作风，由今天起我们是坚决改掉。完全取消了过去的不合群众需要的工作制度，改为整天的随来随收。休息日也立即坚决取消，改为天天办公。今天虽然我们的工作作风与制度开始转变，但还希今后各方群众对我们多提意见，帮助改进才好。\n                  长治邮政局\n    编者意见：长治邮政局这个检讨是很好的。这种勇于接受群众意见，坚决改正缺点的精神应该发扬。但也还有一些机关、团体和个人，当群众在报上对他提出意见后，直到现在仍没答复。这是官僚主义。希望立即改正。"

Of this, 60,000 *dashi* of grain and 20 billion Border Region currency are allocated to the North Yue District, and 30,000 *dashi* of grain and 30 billion Border Region currency are allocated to the Ji-Zhong District. In addition, 100,000 *dashi* of grain will be allocated to the Border Region Bank to purchase silver dollars, copper coins, and other floating wealth, so that the floating wealth distributed to the liberated farmers can immediately be transformed into production capital. The grain for loans will be managed by the county government, with the new farmers' associations below the district level responsible for specific planning. Loans will be uniformly managed by the bank, with the bank having direct relationships with the loan management organs in each county. The grain for agricultural loans has now been allocated to each administrative office, and the funds will also be allocated to each branch bank in batches. In the notice regarding agricultural loans, the Finance and Economics Office pointed out that the guiding principle of agricultural loans is to support and help farmers in production. It is necessary to conduct thorough investigations, specifically understand the difficulties of the farmers, and find ways to lend or arrange for whatever the farmers need. It is necessary to prevent repeating the landlord and rich peasant line, prevent misappropriation and other disguised forms of encroachment; at the same time, it is also necessary to prevent nominal relief and charitable viewpoints. After the agricultural loans are issued, it is necessary to ensure that they are recovered within the prescribed period.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 帮助农民发展生产  晋察冀发放大批农贷\n\n1948-02-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    帮助农民发展生产\n    晋察冀发放大批农贷\n    【新华社晋察冀十三日电】边区财经办事处为帮助农民发展生产，决定全边区拨九万大石粮食、五百亿元边币（每元合蒋币八元左右）办理农贷。计分配北岳区六万大石粮食、二百亿元边币；冀中区三万大石粮食、三百亿元边币。另外，还拨十万大石粮食，由边区银行收买白洋、铜元等浮财。使翻身农民分得之浮财立即变为生产资本。贷粮由县政府经营，由区以下的新农会负责具体计划。贷款统一由银行经营，银行和各县管理贷款机关发生直接关系。农贷的粮食现已拨到各行署，款项也将分批拨到各分行。财办处在关于农贷的通知中指出：农贷的方针在于扶植和帮助农民生产。要进行切实调查，具体了解农民的困难，农民需要什么，就想办法贷出什么或筹办什么，要防止再犯地主富农路线，防止挪用和其他各种变相的侵占；同时也要防止有名无实的救济、恩赐观点。农贷发出后，要保证按规定期间收回。"

    "content": "Experiences of Teachers and Students of Wu'an Normal School in Publicizing the Land Law\n\n    Editor:\n    With the instruction and call of the County Committee, 32 teachers and students of Wu'an Normal School went to the villages on January 25 to publicize the Land Law in coordination with the district cadres. The comrades who publicized in Dongzhaizi Village, Second District, felt the following points in the publicity. I don't know if they are appropriate. Please correct me:\n\n    (1) Do not rely on village cadres, but find poor peasants and hired laborers yourself. Let poor peasants and hired laborers find other poor peasants and hired laborers to spread the word. This way, not only can we find real poor peasants and hired laborers, but they also dare to tell us what they want to say. In Xizhai, we first found old Lian who herds sheep, and then he found Chen Changzi and Lian Lintai, who had been farm laborers all their lives, and then they found more than forty poor peasants and hired laborers. Without the cadres present, they told us everything they had to say. (2) Start with talking about the emancipation (翻身 - turning over), and explain the Land Law based on their actual situation and the village's situation. This is what they love to hear most. They will then know that the Land Law has a close relationship with them. When we asked them if they had turned over thoroughly, Chen Changzi pointed to the thin, tattered cotton coat he was wearing and said, \"Don't even mention it, look at this. The rice is almost gone, and we have no way to celebrate the New Year!\" Lian Lintai and several poor peasants standing beside him also argued, \"Our lives are not as good as the landlords. The cadres of the mutual aid group in the east are working with the landlords, and the share capital is larger than the cooperative, probably two or three million. Others eat well and dress well, but we still eat chaff and bran;\" \"The village secretary and the person in charge of finance and grain are all targets of struggle. We dare not say a word in front of them;\" \"In the past, the fruits and trees of the Farmers' Association were all bought with money. We offered 500, and others offered 1,000. Anyway, we poor people can't buy what we want. Most of the good things and good land are taken by those who have connections and the cadres. We only cultivate some slopes and barren land...\" We told them: The Land Law Outline is to correct these problems. In the future, no one, whether landlords, cadres, or party members, can be shielded. Those who have not been struggled against, and those who have not been struggled against thoroughly, must be struggled against thoroughly. No matter who it is, cadres or anyone else, those who have taken more fruits must return them, and those who have taken less must be compensated. Land must be divided equally according to population, and the excess must be taken from the rich to compensate the poor... The reason why you didn't turn over thoroughly before is because we were not in charge. The Land Law Outline also stipulates that in the future, our poor peasants and hired laborers will be in charge and unite with the middle peasants to thoroughly turn over... Lian Lintai said, \"Chairman Mao sees things clearly and thinks thoroughly. If it is like that in the future, the poor will truly be able to turn over.\" After talking, they were asked to find poor peasants to hold meetings to discuss the Land Law, and they became the backbone and active speakers in the meeting. (3) When explaining the Land Law, do not recite it word for word, line by line, because the masses say, \"It's dizzying and they can't remember it.\" The \"Letter to the Peasants\" should be used in conjunction, explaining one question and one thing at a time, with specific examples. Especially in the relationship between organizing poor peasant leagues and farmers' associations, it should be clearly distinguished, and quick clapper songs should be used to arouse everyone's interest and help them understand. At this time, everyone said, \"It hits the nail on the head! Read it again.\" After the explanation, the spirit of the Land Law: thoroughly eliminate feudalism, poor peasants and hired laborers in charge, unite with the middle peasants... should be brought up to make everyone more clear. Finally, everyone is called upon to prevent sabotage, loopholes, and waste of fruit, and to work hard to produce. (4) It is necessary to repeatedly and carefully visit, publicize, and explain to the poor peasants and hired laborers individually to dispel their worries about cadre retaliation and lack of ability. After the meeting, we went to Lian Lintai and Zhilian to ask them how they felt after listening. Lian Lintai said, \"The Land Law is really good, but do we dare to stand up and take charge?\" We briefly explained the \"Letter to Party Members,\" the border government's proclamation, and the \"Regulations on Punishing Sabotage of Land Reform,\" and gave the actual example of the political director of Shidong being dismissed, telling him that cadres did not dare to retaliate. Zhilian said, \"We honest people don't know how to speak and haven't done anything, so we're afraid we won't get the job!\" We also told him, \"Honest people have honest reasons.\" If everyone contributes some ideas, they can get things done together. It will be unfamiliar at first, but it will get better later. When we left Lian Lintai's (59 years old this year) house, he held a bowl of bran and said to us with a smile, \"Old Li! Tell the higher-ups: Start earlier next year! Send a work team down earlier!\" (5) Don't be impatient when discussing the Land Law: When discussing the Land Law, they raise practical problems and personal matters. Some people ask to elect representatives and start working immediately. We tell them that some things can be solved by the district cadres, and some things can be arranged together next year. The main thing is to let everyone understand the Land Law and then use it, so that they won't make mistakes. Tell them, \"Only after understanding the Land Law can you manage your home well.\" (6) Do not relax the publicity to middle peasants and cadres. In addition to individual publicity and opening poor peasant meetings, farmers' associations should also be opened. Some middle peasants are very afraid, and some think that the landlords have been struggled against enough, and they are not called to participate in the poor peasant meetings, fearing that it will be their turn. Some people say that they will support handing over their surplus grain and furniture when discussing the Land Law Outline. When we were eating at Lao Chen's (upper middle peasant) house, he said that his life has not been good recently, and he still has a few more rooms. When I told him that the floating wealth of the upper middle peasants would definitely not be touched, he asked me twice, \"Really? Really?\" I said yes, and he was relieved. Therefore, in the farmers' association, in addition to general publicity, we must point out why the poor peasants and hired laborers should be in charge, and unite with the middle peasants, emphasizing that we are fighting feudalism, not the middle peasants. The middle peasants have also suffered from feudal oppression and exploitation. The poor peasants and middle peasants are one family. Even the floating wealth of the upper middle peasants will definitely not be touched, and should not be wasted. When it is time to deliver manure, deliver it, and record whose manure is delivered more. The other party will find the money (this is instructed by the County Committee), and no one will suffer; Some cadres also have some doubts, fearing that the Land Law Outline is to struggle against the cadres and dismiss all the cadres. Some are a little depressed, and some are suspiciously trying to win over the poor peasants. Here we focus on the People's Daily short commentary on January 20, \"Knowing Mistakes and Correcting Mistakes is the Only Way Out,\" saying that good cadres will still be supported by the masses, so that everyone can rest assured.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th: The Binhai Military Sub-district and the Administrative Office jointly issued instructions, strictly stipulating measures to reduce the burden of labor service on villagers: (1) Reduce the official duties of village cadres and oppose the \"official yamen\" style. All organs and troops should appropriately add daily necessities such as bowls, chopsticks, vegetable basins, and water tanks. Items that must be borrowed should be borrowed and exchanged uniformly by the management department. Personnel going out to villages for meals, exchanging fodder, and lighting lamps must pay grain coupons, food money, grass tickets, material tickets, and lamp oil fees. It is forbidden to exchange coarse for fine, use grain to offset vegetables, or pay less or not at all. (2) Strictly control the procedures for dispatching labor. Dispatching labor requires a dispatch certificate. Organs and troops should organize their own grinding and cooking, and transport grain and grass within a 30-mile radius (except for troops in combat). Advocate self-sewing and mending. The delivery of letters and all odd jobs are prohibited from using civilian labor. (3) Divide areas for borrowing items, issue borrowing certificates for borrowed items, and compensate for any damage. It is strictly forbidden to privately set official prices, demand more and give less, and prohibit engaging in labor production such as picking up grass and manure, and fishing, which compete with the people for profit. Other acts that harm the interests of the masses are also prohibited.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th: The Binhai District Committee, Military Sub-district, Administrative Office, and other organs recently conducted a detailed investigation of discipline in villages. Because the personnel of various organs generally harbor the remnant ideas of landlords, rich peasants, and warlords, they arbitrarily increase the burden on the masses in the stationed areas. When the military sub-district first arrived in a certain village, in addition to the help of the children's corps, literacy classes, and the village head, more than a dozen village cadres were specially assigned to handle errands for the organs every day. In addition to bearing the burdens of sending cadres and their families, transporting grain, grass, and delivering letters, the masses even used civilian labor for odd jobs such as burning firewood, chopping wood, building stoves, making tofu, sprouting soybeans, and moving utensils. The military sub-district used 180 civilian laborers within five days of moving to a certain village. The burden on women for sewing clothes and making shoes was also extremely heavy, and they often provided needles and thread. In addition, the procedures for borrowing utensils were chaotic, with some items borrowed but not returned, or returned in damaged condition. Based on the above situation, the district military and political organs immediately convened a military conference to thoroughly convey the \"Measures to Reduce the Labor Service Burden on Villagers,\" and established a joint military-civilian office in the stationed village to uniformly raise grain, grass, fodder, and necessary utensils for the troops, and assist the masses in supervising the troops to abide by discipline. The situation was promptly reported to the troops. Currently, various departments are enthusiastically discussing ways to reduce the burden on the masses through production and frugality, self-transportation of grain and grass, and self-grinding and self-cooking.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 滨海订定减轻民负办法\n\n1948-02-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    滨海订定减轻民负办法\n    【新华社山东十三日电】滨北军分区、专署发布联合训令，严格订定减轻驻村劳役负担办法：（一）减轻村干应差事务，反对“衙门”作风，各机关部队酌情添置碗筷、菜盆、水缸等日常用品，必须借用之物品，概由管理部门统一批借兑换。外出人员到村派饭、兑换草料、点灯等必须照付粮票、菜金、草票、料票及灯油费，禁止以粗换细，以粮顶菜及少付不付现象。（二）严格支差手续，支差要有支差证，机关部队组织自磨自食，三十里路内自运粮草（部队在战斗情况下例外），提倡自缝自补，传递信条，及一切零活禁止使用民力。（三）划分借物地区，借物给借证，损坏一定赔偿，严禁私订官价，少给多要，禁止从事拾草拾粪，摸鱼等与民争利的劳动生产，并禁止其他一切损害群众利益行为。\n    【新华社山东十三日电】滨北地委、军分区、专署等机关，于日前详细调查驻村纪律。由于各机关人员普遍存在地主富农和军阀残余思想，随意增加驻地群众负担。军分区初到某庄时，除儿童团、识字班、闾长等帮助外，每天有十几个村干专为机关应差。群众除负担送干部、家属、运粮、运草、递信等差役外甚至连烧火、劈柴、打锅台、做豆腐、生豆芽、搬用具等零活也使用民力，军分区移驻某村五天即使用民工一百八十个，妇女缝衣、做鞋等负担亦极繁重，且常贴针线。此外所借用具手续混乱，有借无还、或借好还坏。根据上述情形，分区军政机关即召开军人大会，详细传达“减轻驻村群众劳役办法”，并成立驻村军民联合办事处，统一筹借部队所用之粮草、马料及必须用具，并协助群众监督部队遵守纪律。及时向部队反映情况，现各部门正热烈讨论生产节约，自运粮草、自磨自食等减轻群众负担办法。"

This has been widely promoted, enabling the factories to accelerate their capital turnover and expand production. After the implementation of this type of transaction, according to statistics from Yongmao, Tongyixing, Tianxing, Hengfeng, and other five factories in just seven days, 5,650 iron pots and 200 loads of Western waterwheels and waterwheels with trailers were sold, totaling 105.04 million Jinchaji Border Region currency. The prices of the raw material objects paid to the factories by the Trading Company were lower than the market prices: for example, millet was priced at 1,100 per jin (catty) while the market price was 1,200, a bag of white flour was priced at 84,000 while the market price was 85,000, coke was priced at 250 per jin while the market price was 280, and Yangquan coal was priced at 330 per jin while the market price was 340.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the sharp drop in commodity prices currently occurring in the United States has rapidly become a major event of global attention. The price plunge began around February 4th. The Associated Press's wholesale price index for thirty-five commodities (with 1926 as 100) calculated the index after the plunge to be 195, dropping to 191.65 by the 9th, compared to 208.1 on January 9th of this year. American merchants say this is the largest price drop since the end of the war. This price collapse was led by grain prices, and grain, especially wheat prices, had consistently been at the forefront of price increases since the end of the war. The current situation has been reversed, with wheat, a staple food, falling at least 30 cents per bushel in three days. Corn, the most stable grain in the past few months, fell at least 24 cents per bushel (Note: U.S. bushel is approximately 3.4 *dou* in China). The prices of many other types of food and industrial raw materials have also fallen, including flour, sugar, pork, beef, lamb, lard, linseed oil, leather, cotton, and wool. As of the 13th, this collapse was continuing and showed no signs of stopping.\n\nThis US price collapse occurred when overall wholesale prices had risen to near the 1920 peak, a major reversal of the soaring prices since the US abolished price controls in June 1946. The Associated Press stated, \"Wheat at three dollars a bushel is gone forever.\" The most notable feature of this reversal is a further decline after a decline, to the point of a collapse, rather than a rise after a decline. Most grain prices reached their peak on January 16th, began to decline the next day, continued to decline in the second week, and then turned into a collapse after the 4th of this month. This drop is by no means limited to commodity prices. According to the Associated Press, the price of the New York Stock Exchange, the center of the US financial market, also experienced a sharp drop at the same time, and business failures exceeded any similar period since 1942. Moreover, prior to the collapse, the US government's Federal Reserve Board announced that industrial production in December of last year had declined compared to previous months; and in the first half of January, department store sales declined more than the usual seasonal decline.\n\nThe US price collapse has caused \"widespread unease\" in New York, the financial capital of the United States. The New York Herald Tribune believes that \"the decline in agricultural prices will lead to a decline in industrial goods prices.\" American business leaders have therefore developed well-founded fears. According to the Associated Press, \"What they fear most is a sudden drop, which means a depression, which will cause all prices to fall, and businesses to stagnate, people will lose their jobs, and their incomes will fall so fast that they won't even have money to buy low-priced goods.\" According to an Associated Press dispatch from TASS in New York, \"Most people associated with the American business community cannot hide their deep concern about the impending national situation, that the fall in stock and commodity prices will form the prelude to a sharp reversal of the economic situation.\" Not only in the United States, but also in countries around the world, \"all countries are paying close attention to the trend of US prices, and the point of attention for each country is whether the recent sharp drop in US prices and stocks in the past three days is a prelude to the collapse of the US economy.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: TASS, New York, February 12th: The US price collapse and industrial stock decline continue. The report of the Du John commercial ruling body clearly reflects the severity of this situation. The report estimates that general commodity prices have fallen by 15.5% in the past few days. The Federal Reserve Board announced that loans to industry, agriculture, and commerce approved by the Federal Reserve Bank decreased significantly yesterday. In the week ending February 4th, these loans decreased by $83 million, indicating a deterioration of bank credit. The New York Post expressed concern about the economic situation, warning of a possible economic crisis.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th: New York: American industrialists and businessmen are panicking over the recent plunge in commodity and securities prices, and most fear that this may be the prelude to a larger economic collapse. According to an Associated Press report on the 8th, \"This price collapse has quickly attracted nationwide attention in the United States, because the United States has long been plagued by talk of economic depression. Hard-hearted industrialists are thinking, is this a harbinger of a recession?\" A United Press International dispatch on the 9th also stated: This collapse \"increased the panic among American manufacturers, who have long anticipated the collapse of the wartime boom.\" The dispatch revealed that in their mixed commentaries, the mouthpieces of American big capitalists - the reactionary American newspapers - mostly expressed fear about this collapse, which portends a \"sharp turn for the worse in the economic situation.\"\n\nThe price drop of grains and raw materials started in Chicago and other places, going from rising to falling sharply, with great momentum. The Associated Press called it a \"historic event.\" The TASS report cited the agency's wholesale price index for 35 commodities (with 1926 as 100), pointing out that it had fallen to 191.65 on the 9th, while this index had been as high as 200.67 in early November last year. The Associated Press also stated that New York stock trading continued to decline when it opened on the 10th. Other commodities such as meat and butter also continued to fall. According to a United Press International dispatch on the 10th, news of price declines came from all over the country. Pork prices have fallen by two to seven dollars in two weeks, but Chicago still has 4,000 pigs that cannot be sold. Beef prices in the city also fell by half a dollar to three dollars, and most markets have a large number of foods that cannot be sold. The dispatch quoted a spokesman for the Retail Meat Merchants Association as saying that retail meat prices have fallen by 10% since the beginning of the year.\n\nThis US economic \"upheaval\" has attracted worldwide attention. Some capitalist countries have suffered serious adverse effects. For example, on the 10th, the Sydney Stock Exchange in Australia saw widespread declines in stock prices after brokers announced the fall in US prices and Cripps' recent economic warnings. \"In fact, all markets were plunged into the biggest sell-off in a year,\" \"resulting in a loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds in the price of major securities in one day\" (Associated Press).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 经济形势急剧恶化  美国股票物价暴跌  大资本家都害怕的不得了\n\n1948-02-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    经济形势急剧恶化\n    美国股票物价暴跌\n    大资本家都害怕的不得了\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：刻在美国发生的物价暴跌，已迅速成为全世界注目的重大事件。物价暴跌起始于本月四日前后。美联社对三十五种商品批发价格指数（一九二六年为一百）计算暴跌后之指数为一九五，九日已跌至一九一·六五，而在今年一月九日之指数为二○八·一。美国商人们说：这是战事结束以来最大规模的物价跌落。此次物价暴跌，以粮价带头，而谷物尤其是小麦价格，自战争结束以来，即一直被排列于物价上涨的前列。现在的形势则被倒转过来，主要食粮的小麦在三天之内每蒲式尔至少下跌三角。过去数月中最稳定的谷物玉蜀黍每蒲式尔至少下跌二角四分（按：美制每蒲式尔约合我国三·四斗）。许多其他种类之粮食及工业原料之价格亦已下跌，其中包括面粉、糖、猪肉、牛肉、羊肉、猪油、亚麻油、皮革、棉花及羊毛，截至十三日为止，此种暴跌仍在持续中，且无停滞象征。\n    此次美国物价暴跌，发生于整个批发价格高涨至接近一九二○年物价最高峰之际，是一九四六年六月美国废除物价管制以来涨风狂吹的一大逆转。美联社称：“三美元一蒲式尔的小麦已一去不复返了”。此次逆转之显著特点为下降后之再下降，以至有暴跌，而并非下降后之再上升。大多数谷物价格在一月十六日达其最高峰，第二日即开始下降，第二周继续下降，至本月四日以后即转为暴跌。此次跌落绝非仅限于物价。据美联社称：美国金融市场的中心——纽约股票交易所的价格，在同时亦发生暴跌，而商业之倒闭，则超过自一九四二年以来任何同一时期。又，暴跌以前，据美政府联邦储备局宣布，去年十二月份之工业生产量已较前此数月下降；而在一月份的前半月中，百货公司销售量之下降，已较平常季节性的下降为多。\n    美国物价暴跌发生之后，已引起美国金融首都纽约的“广泛不安”，纽约先驱论坛报认为：“农产品之跌价将使工业品跌价”。美国商业界领袖已因此发生十分有理由的恐惧。据美联社称：“他们最怕的是突然下跌，这就意味着萧条，从而使一切物价下跌，并使企业陷于停滞，人们将失掉工作，其收入跌落得这么快，以致连购买低物价物品的钱都没有”。又据美联社引塔斯社之纽约电讯称：“美国与商业界有关之多数人士，不能掩饰他们对于将临的国家情况的深切关怀，即股票及商品价格之跌落将形成经济形势急剧逆转的前奏”。不仅在美国，而且在全世界“各国，对美国物价趋势咸极注意，而各国注意之点为最近三日来美国物价及股票之突跌是否为美国经济崩溃之先兆”。\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：美国物价暴跌和工业股票跌落仍继续中。杜·约翰商业统治机关的报告，清楚地反映了这种情形的严重性。该报告估计，过去数日内，一般商品价格跌落了百分之十五·五。联邦储备局宣布：联邦储备银行批准的工、农、商各业贷款昨日均有显著减少，在至二月四日为止的一周内，这类贷款已减少八千三百万美元，这表示了银行信用的恶化，纽约邮报对经济形势表示忧虑，警告可能发生经济危机。\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】纽约讯：美国工商业家对最近物价及证券价格的暴跌，恐慌万状，大多害怕这可能是更大经济暴跌的先兆。据美联社八日报导：“这次价格暴跌迅速引起美国全国的注意，因为美国久已为经济萧条之说所烦恼。硬心肠的工业家心里在想，这就是不景气的预兆吗？合众社九日电亦称：这次暴跌“增加了美国制造商的恐慌，他们很久以来就预料战时的景气会崩溃”。该电透露，美国大资本家御用喉舌——美国反动报纸在其纷杂的评论中，对预示着“经济形势的急转直下”的这次暴跌大多表示恐惧。\n    这次粮食及原料品的跌价，系由芝加哥等地开始，由上涨而下泻，来势甚猛，美联社称之为“历史性事件”。塔斯社所引该社三十五种商品批发价格的指数（以一九二六年为一百）指出，九日已跌至一九一点六五，而此项指数去年十一月初却曾高达二百点六七。美联社又称：纽约股票交易在十日开盘时，仍有跌落。其他商品如肉类、牛油等亦继续下跌。另据合众社十日电称，全国各地均传来物价下跌的消息。猪价两周来已跌了二元至七元，但芝加哥仍有四千口猪无法卖出。该市牛价也降落了半元至三元，大多数市场都有大批食物无法卖出。该电引零售肉商协会发言人称，零售肉价自年初以来已跌了百分之十。\n    美国这次经济“大波动”，引起全世界的注意。某些资本主义国家已蒙受严重不利的影响，例如澳洲悉尼交易所十日在经纪人宣布美国物价下跌与克利浦斯最近所发的经济警告后，股票价格普遍下跌，实际上一切市场都陷入一年来最大的抛售浪潮中”，“致使主要证券价格一日内损失数十万镑”（美联社）。"

    "content": "Please Comrades of the Third District of She County, Investigate Properly: Village Cadres of Xishu Village Oppress the Poor\n    Farmers:\n    Our newspaper welcomes everyone to denounce the crimes of the landlords here, expose shortcomings in our work, promote things that our farmers think are good and appropriate, and put forward your own demands and suggestions for improving our work. All institutions, organizations, and individuals mentioned by you must express their attitude. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to your opinions should accept them and act accordingly. If there are any inappropriate points, explanations can be made and different opinions can be put forward. If you can write, write it yourselves. If you can't, you can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write for you, or you can come to the newspaper yourself. If that doesn't work, write a letter to the newspaper to let us know, and we can figure out a solution. Editorial comrades are responsible!\n    I was very saddened to read in the February 6th newspaper about Yang Xihe bullying people by relying on his power. I believe that in Xishu Village, Third District of She County, the masses are suffering greatly from the oppression of the cadres. The village chief is Jiang Haixin (a rich peasant), the political director is Zhang Liancheng (a former rich peasant), the public security officer is Wang Xianzhang (an old middle peasant), and the director of the armed forces committee is Lian Qinghai (an upper-middle peasant). During the famine years of '43 and '44, there was a poor peasant named Wang Shuyu, whose family had no food at all. After not eating for three days, he went to the field and stole two corncobs from a landlord. He was seen by the farmers' association director, Li Youyi (a former rich peasant), and Li Zhiguo, who brutally beat and hanged Wang Shuyu and then immediately executed him. I think Wang Shuyu could not bear the hunger, so he went to steal two corncobs to eat. If he were a landlord or a rich peasant, he wouldn't be hungry, would he go eat raw corncobs? Li Youyi also said that his stealing corncobs damaged the reputation of the farmers' association. Wang Xianzhang and Zhang Liancheng said: He should be executed. Also, Zhang Gaishun's wife went to the fields to dig for wild vegetables, and Jiang Haixin said she trampled the crops, so he hung her up and beat her, and also fined her a lot of money, which led to her and her husband divorcing. All this money was embezzled by these cadres. There is proof of this. Ask Wang Tianchang about the execution of Wang Shuyu and you will understand. It was necessary to force Gaishun's wife to divorce, and now Gaishun's wife is \"seeing\" Wang Laowu. Ask him and he will know. Last year, Wang Shuyu's son, Wang Youjin, joined the army and brought up the fact that the cadres had harmed his father. The cadres promised to erect a monument for Wang Shuyu, but after Wang Youjin left, they didn't do it. During the famine years, Jiang Haixin ate meat and noodles every day and had affairs with women. Wang Xianzhang used the special agent Wang Shuting to collect debts. The masses' opinions are proven by Lian Zhongyi. If you don't believe it, you can ask Lian Zhongyi and he will know. The common people don't dare to say anything. During the famine years, the cadres used public grain to buy land, buy sheep, and open restaurants, and no one dared to say anything. It was necessary to force Jiang Laoyuan to hand over public grain. Jiang Laoyuan sold his land to the cadres to offset the public grain. Forced to the point of no other option, Laoyuan gave the land to the cadres and fled to Shanxi. Ask Jiang Laoyuan and he will know. Some working comrades only listen to these cadres and don't ask the common people. The common people don't dare to speak out because they are afraid of the cadres taking revenge. Now that the poor peasants and farm laborers want to be masters of their own destiny, these bad cadres still want to intimidate people by relying on their power. Wang Xianzhang and Zhang Liancheng went to the Railway Bureau, and he said he was acting as some sort of \"commissioner\" (a big official). Lian Qinghai went to the De Tai Heng shop to be some sort of manager. Jiang Haixin went to the Party School to be some sort of administrator. He still uses these big words to intimidate the common people. I hope the comrades working in the Third District can investigate this properly, encourage the poor peasants to be bold and offer their opinions, and make these bad cadres thoroughly examine themselves, so that good and bad can be distinguished clearly. The bad cadres' embezzled fruits of the masses should be brought up by the masses, and they should be returned to the masses. The things bought with public grain during the famine years should also be returned. Furthermore, why haven't the poor peasants turned themselves around? Last year, when carrying out the movement, the political director, Zhang Liancheng, said: Whoever wants to struggle and offer opinions will be held responsible. If you struggle wrongly, you will have to give the rich man a big flag to support him. This sentence scared the masses so much that they didn't dare to offer many opinions against the rich. This was said openly in the farmers' association, and everyone knows it. In reality, he is protecting the rich. Now, the landlord Li Longkui thinks that the old cadres have already been removed, and no one will support him anymore, so he voluntarily took out more than ninety silver dollars. Why didn't he take it out during last year's movement? This proves that the cadres were protecting the landlords. These cadres also used many hoodlums to intimidate the masses, and also said that they and the workers were on good terms. The masses said behind their backs: \"It turns out the cadres can eat openly, they are originally officials protecting each other.\" But now the Land Law outline is to elevate the poor, the masses' bitterness must be poured out, to complain is to be done with it. The bad deeds of these cadres cannot be finished in one sitting, let the masses bring it up and let them examine themselves. There are some other things I would also like to bring up. Four years ago, the cadres confiscated more than two thousand yuan from the poor peasant Li Ergou, and didn't allow Ergou to tell anyone about it. Ask Ergou and he will know the details. I will talk to you comrades again when I think of something else!\n          Jing Long January 28th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 请涉县三区干部好好调查  西戍村干压迫穷人\n景隆\n1948-02-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    请涉县三区干部好好调查\n    西戍村干压迫穷人农民们：\n    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控拆地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写，要不就亲自来报馆跑一趟，再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。编辑负责同志们！\n    我看到二月六日那天的报，说的是杨希和仗势欺人，我是非常痛心。我想涉县三区西戍村，群众受干部恨（很）大压迫。有村长江海心（富农）、证（政）治主任张连成（是旧富农）、公安员王献章（是老中农）、武委会主任连清海（是上中农），三十二、三年灾荒，有贫农王书玉，家中一个粮食赤（吃）食无有，三天未有吃饭，到地扒了地主二个玉交（茭），被农会主任李有义（旧富农）与李治国看见，将王书玉非形（刑）吊打一顿，立刻枪决死了。我想王书玉饥饿难应（忍），才去扒二个玉交（茭）吃。要是地主富农，他不饥，他也去吃生玉交（茭）？李有义还说他扒玉交（茭），是破坏了农会名誉，王献章、张连成说：应该枪决。还有张改顺妻去地挖（剜）菜，江海心说她踏了谷，将她吊打一绳，还法（罚）了她好多钱款，闹的她夫妻离婚了，这些钱完全是者（这）几个干部私吞了。此事都有证明，枪决死王书玉刻下问王天昌就明白了。立必（逼）改顺夫妻离婚，现下改顺妻与王老五“对相”（象）了，问他就知到（道）了。去年王书玉儿子王有金去参军，将干部害他父亲提出来了，干部许给王书玉立碑，王有金去后又不办了。过灾荒年江海心每天吃肉吃面（面）搞女人，王献章用的特务王书亭收仗（帐），群众意见有连仲义证明，如不信可去问连仲义就知到（道）了。老百姓谁也不敢坑（吭）。灾荒年干部拿公粮买地买羊开饭管（馆），谁也不敢坑（吭）。立必（逼）江老元交公粮，江老元将地买（卖）给干部顶了公粮，必（逼）的老元无法将地给了干部，往山西逃难去，刻下问江老元便知。有些工作员同志光听者（这）几个干部的话，并不问老百姓，老百姓也不敢说，都怕干部报伏（复）。现在贫雇农要当家，者（这）些坏干部还想仗势下乎（吓唬）人。王献章和张连成去铁路局，他说当什么兼伪（监委）（是大官），连清海去德太恒商店当什么经理，江海心去党校当什么管理员，他还是拿这些大话下乎（吓唬）老百姓。我希望在三区工作同志可好好吊（调）查一下，要叫贫农但（胆）大来提意见，要叫者（这）些坏干部好好检讨，好坏要分青（清）。坏干部贪污的群众果食（实）叫群众提出来，他应当退还群众，灾荒年使公粮买的群众东西，叫他也可退还。再说为什么贫农没有翻了身？去年搞运动，政治主任张连成说：谁要斗争提意见谁赴（负）责任，斗惜（错）了还得给老财扶杆大旗。者（这）句话郝（吓）的群众也不敢与老财多提意见了。此话是在农会里公开说来，每个人都之（知）道，十（实）记（际）是他包皮（庇）老财。现时地主李隆魁想的旧干部已今（经）换吊（掉）了，也无人与他作主了，他又自动拿出现洋九十余元。为什么去年运动他不往外拿？者（这）就是证明是干部包皮（庇）地主。者（这）些干部还利用好多流氓威郝（吓）群众，还说我与工作员都是相好，群众被（背）地说：“该还是干部能吃开了，原是官官相会（卫）。”不果（过）现在土地法大缸（纲）是提高贫人，群众苦水一定要倒出来，要树树（诉诉）苦就算完了。者（这）些干部的坏事一时说不完，叫群众提出，叫他自己检讨。还有一些我亦提出，前四年干部没收了贫农李二狗款二千余元，还不叫二狗对人说，问二狗便知详细。我以后想其（起）来与你们同志在（再）谈吧！\n          景隆  一月二十八日"

    "content": "Carpenter Hao Wangjin of Chige Dao Village\nSays the Village Chief Oppresses Him\n\nHao Wangjin, a poor peasant from Chige Dao Village, Third District, Lucheng, recounts the injustice of being oppressed by cadres, asking everyone to judge whether it is reasonable or not:\n\n　　I am fifty-four years old this year, and my hometown is Lin County. My family was poor when I was young, only cultivating a little over an acre of land. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, I fled to Pingshun and rented mountain slope land for three years, but still couldn't make a living. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, I settled in Chige Dao Village, Lucheng. During the famine years (thirty-third year of the Republic of China), the village office released the community granary, giving each poor person two and a half jin. I was the poorest in the village, and my six-member family only got ten jin. In the spring of the year (1947), there were two trees on the land allocated to me: a pear tree and a fruit tree. The village chief, Li Shutang, and the volunteer teacher, Shi Xiantang, moved both of my trees to their homes. Later, I wouldn't accept it, and they planted two small, finger-thick trees for me, but I didn't want them. In June, I wanted to trade my cow for a small donkey. I thought buying a small donkey would usually cost about 100,000 yuan, and my cow could sell for over 70,000 yuan. I wanted to ask the village chief to lend me 30,000 or 40,000 yuan so I could buy one. On the fifth day of the seventh lunar month, I went to the West Township fair to buy livestock. The village chief bought a mule and asked me to lend him 10,000 yuan. In order to get him to lend me the money, I lent it to him. Later, he didn't lend me the money, and even said that the 10,000 yuan he borrowed from me never happened. In the end, he only gave me 1,000 yuan, saying he only borrowed 1,000. But I was afraid of offending him, so I had to say that I might have forgotten. Now, I still haven't gotten back the 9,000 yuan. In the summer, my child got into a fight with the son of a landlord, Wang Guangyun. The village chief, Li Shutang, detained my child, but the landlord's son was fine. This winter, the organization is organizing production to solve the difficulties of the poor. I am a carpenter, and I went to Jingyu Village to work for others. I had only been there for a few days when the village chief called me back, saying that the village had provisions and that I couldn't go to other villages. He said I wasn't allowed to leave the village in the future. I thought it would be fine as long as I could earn some millet, but I stayed at home for a long time without any provisions. A few days later, a landlord died, and I went to help with the funeral. When talking about turning over a new leaf, I said that turning over a new leaf is not the same, there are good and bad aspects! The village chief immediately pursued me, asking: How much did the cave you live in cost? Even turning over a new leaf has become a shortcoming! Speaking of this, the cadres always turn over more thoroughly than the masses. For example, when distributing fruit (grain), the poor get the grain eaten by small bugs, while the cadres get the beans. Is that fair or not? I can't bear the losses I've suffered. A few days ago, I secretly went to the district to appeal and vent my grievances. But comrades Zhao and Wang from the district summoned the village chief to the district for a trip. He came back and said that I went to the district to accuse all the cadres and that he was preparing to mobilize the masses to struggle against me. Appealing to the district has brought me a crime! The village chief took a tree from the landlord Wang Guangyun, so he shielded him, and they didn't confiscate all his grain during the struggle. My family was allocated two plots of gully land when distributing the fruit, which were far worse than other people's gullies. From the perspective of his background, the village chief is a poor peasant, just like me, but he shouldn't forget the poor after becoming a cadre and then oppress the poor! When I talk about these things, tears keep flowing from my eyes, and my heart is pounding. Anyway, I have to vent my grievances, and I must make him understand this reason.\n\nEditor Comrades:\n　　This material was given to me by the old man Hao Wangjin when he found me at the resident of the Third District. I took notes while he was complaining to me. I think their grievances are considerable, so I specially wrote to ask you to accept it.

For a segment of the honest, basic masses who, because they cannot speak well or dare to speak at all, coupled with those who do land reform work poorly and do not know for whom they are doing land reform, also do not know for whom they are doing mass movements, so they are thrown aside, forgotten, and remain oppressed.

This makes me want to be a crutch for them, to be a correspondent for the newspaper in this great land reform movement. This is my full-hearted passion, is it possible? I request a reply from the newspaper. Furthermore, I have seen materials from various areas in the border region in the newspaper, but I have not seen any materials, \"good\" or \"bad,\" from my county, district, or village regarding land reform.

    "content": "Xingtai Districts Convene Farmer Congresses to Analyze and Study Land Law\n\nAround the 22nd day of the twelfth lunar month, all districts in Xingtai convened joint congresses of hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants. At these meetings, the Land Law was explained and analyzed in detail. It was emphasized that middle and poor peasants are brothers, and all farmers under heaven belong to one family, which alleviated the concerns of many middle and poor peasants and cadres. After returning to their villages, everyone studied and discussed the law every evening in winter schools, and much progress has been made.\n\nAfter the publicity from this congress, the poor and hired laborers were very happy. Lian Zhenlin, a hired laborer from Niu Tian, 11th District, said at the congress: \"I herded sheep for Landlord Mou for twenty-four years and worked for him for four years. Last winter, during the emancipation movement, our family of one was allocated five mu of land (one mu of paddy field and four mu of dry land). It sounds like a lot, but it's all sandy land where even dogs don't urinate. This year, it only yielded one dan of coarse grains. Not to mention clothes, we don't even have enough to eat, it's worse than herding sheep! Now that the land is being equally distributed, Chairman Mao wants us poor and hired laborers to hold power. We must ensure it is distributed fairly and not leave anyone in poverty.\"\n\nDi Qihua, a hired laborer from Shangpo Village, 9th District, said: \"During last year's movement, we hired laborers didn't really hold power, and we suffered losses. The appraisers were all eloquent people, and they and the cadres all looked upwards with 'wasp eyes'. Some good things were distributed to cadres and activists. We poor people didn't dare to say a single word of 'disagreement'. This time, we must firmly grasp the handle of the Land Law and thoroughly emancipate ourselves politically and economically.\"\n\nDuring the study of the Land Law, the thinking of some cadres was also straightened out. Cao Xingjun, the political director of Xiaoge Village, 8th District, said: \"Cadres who have taken too much of the fruits should voluntarily return them. If they admit their mistakes and correct them, the masses can forgive them. But if they stubbornly refuse to return them and refuse to admit their mistakes, they will definitely be opposed by the masses. This is a concrete departure from the masses, and it will not end well.\"\n\nThe suspicions of the middle peasants were also dispelled. After the congress, when studying the Land Law at the winter school in Shangpozi, well-to-do middle peasant Ma Liansheng said: \"Previously, I only thought that last year we struggled against the landlords, and this year it would definitely be against the middle peasants. I was worried that the hired laborers would beat me up again, and I would lose both property and face. I had no motivation for production. Today, I was called to the meeting, and they said that all farmers under heaven are one family, that middle peasants and poor peasants are brothers, that the surplus wealth of well-to-do middle peasants would not be touched, that surplus land should be voluntarily given up, and that there would be no struggle. Previously, I didn't understand the Land Law, and I cut six or seven dan of firewood less.\" Zhehu used hired laborers as the backbone to unite with middle peasants to jointly study the Land Law, exposing the distortions and sabotage of bad elements. The middle peasants were then at ease, and well-to-do middle peasant Yao Wengong said: \"I didn't understand the Land Law, and I ate half a pig.\" (From the \"Organize\" Small Newspaper)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邢台各区召开农民大会  分析研究土地法\n\n1948-02-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    邢台各区召开农民大会\n    分析研究土地法\n    邢台各区在腊月二十二日前后，召开了雇贫中农联合大会，在会上详细讲解分析了土地法，并提出中贫农是弟兄，天下农民是一家，解除了不少中贫农和干部的顾虑。各村回去后，每天晚上又在冬学研究讨论，已获得不少成绩。\n    经过这次大会宣传后，贫雇都非常高兴。十一区连牛田雇贫连贞林在大会上说：“我给侔地主放了二十四年羊，还做过四年活，去冬闹翻身咱一口人分给咱五亩地（水地一亩、旱地四亩）。听亩垄不少，都是狗尿不着的沙滩，今年只打了一石粗粮，别说穿衣裳，吃还不够，还不如放羊哩！这回平分土地，毛主席叫咱贫雇掌权，一定要叫他平平哩，不叫他有一个穷坑。”\n    九区上坡村雇贫狄起华说：“去年运动反正咱雇贫没掌住权，吃了亏，评议员都是能说会道的人，和干部他们都是马蜂眼光往上看，有些好东西都分给了干部积极人，咱穷人敢说个‘不同意’三字，这回咱一定要掌住土地法的刀把子，在政治上，经济上把身翻的透透哩。”\n    在研究土地法中，一部分干部的思想也打通了。八区小戈了政治主任曹兴俊说：“干部多占了果果实，要自动退出，有错改错群众能原谅，如坚决不退，有错不承认，定要受到群众的反对，这是具体脱离了群众，得不到好结果的。”\n    中农的怀疑也打破了。会后上坡子在冬学研究土地法时，富裕中农马连生说：“先前我光想去年斗地主，今年一定是斗中农，我再叫雇贫打一顿，人财两丢，这多败兴，就没心思闹生产了，今天叫我开会，说天下农民是一家，中农贫农是弟兄，富裕中农的浮财分文不动，多余土地自愿拿出来，坚决不斗，先前我没闹通土地法，少打了六七担柴火。”折户以雇贫为骨干联合中农共同研究土地法，揭破了坏分子的曲解和破坏。中农才安心了，富裕中农姚文公说：“我没摸清土地法，吃了半个猪。”（“组织起来”小报）"

In a certain town in Ye County, under the leadership of the democratic government, the peasants have initially turned themselves around. On the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month, the local farmers' association distributed 33 shi of grain, as well as clothes, cloth, furniture, and other items, to 1,280 impoverished farmers. Many farmers said while receiving the grain: \"At this time last year, we were hiding from debts everywhere, and we didn't even dare to go home on New Year's Eve. This year is completely different.\" All the families in the town posted self-written couplets, such as \"The Liberation Army has come to Henan, and the common people have food to eat and clothes to wear.\" On the first day of the Spring Festival, gongs and drums resounded everywhere. The troops' yangko teams and the farmers' lion dance teams rejoiced together all day long. Huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu were hung at the crossroads, and people crowded there all day to pay New Year's greetings to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.\n\nThe peasants of Baofeng are also celebrating the New Year amidst an intense struggle for emancipation. Everyone is wearing new clothes and exchanging New Year's greetings. The chairman of a farmers' association in a certain town told reporters, \"The greatest joy this year is that no one is pressing for debts in the twelfth lunar month, no baozhang is coming to ask for New Year's donations, and we don't have to grind flour, steam steamed buns, or sweep the floor for the landlords.\" In two months, the village had distributed nearly 2,000 mu of land, more than 15,000 jin of grain, and more than 1,000 pieces of clothing to more than 1,000 poor people. During the New Year, the farmers' association also distributed money for a catty of meat to each poor household, so every household made dumplings on New Year's Eve.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南线新区人民欢度春节  向毛主席朱总司令拜年\n\n1948-02-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    南线新区人民欢度春节\n    向毛主席朱总司令拜年\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十五日电】新区人民欢度解放后第一个春节。叶县某镇农民在民主政府领导下已初步翻身，腊月二十八日，该地农会又分给一千二百八十个贫苦农民以三十三石粮食和衣服、布匹、家具等一部。许多农民在领粮时都说：去年这时到处躲债，年三十夜还不敢回家，今年可是大不同了。镇上各家都贴出自编的对联，如“解放军来到河南，老百姓有吃有穿”。春节第一天，到处锣鼓喧天，驻军的秧歌队和农民的狮子队尽日同乐，十字街口悬挂着毛主席和朱总司令的巨幅画像，整天挤满了人向毛主席和朱总司令拜年。\n    宝丰农民也在紧张的翻身斗争中欢度新春，大家穿着新衣服拜年。某镇农会主席告诉记者说：“今年最大的痛快是腊月没人逼帐，没保长来要过年捐，不用去给地主磨面、蒸馒头、扫地了”。该村在两个月内已有一千多穷人分了将近两千多亩土地、一万五千斤粮食和一千多件衣服，过年时农会还给穷户每户分了一斤肉钱，因此年三十晚家家户户都包了饺子。"

On January 7th, the Jianghan People's Liberation Army liberated Sui County, annihilating the Chiang bandit Hubei Provincial Security Fourth General Team and the pseudo-Commissioner's Office, county government, etc., connecting the Jianghan and Tongbai liberated areas into one. They also captured Mashiguai and Honggoushi on the north bank of the Yangtze River on the 4th, and Dongjinwan on the east bank of the Han River on the 20th, shocking the Chiang bandits in Hanxi south of the Yangtze River, and Xiangyang declared a state of emergency. The Liberation Army also liberated Deng County, one of the reactionary fortresses of the Chiang bandits in Wanxi, on the 16th, completely annihilating eleven security regiments of the Chiang bandits. The Liberation Army active on the outskirts of Hankou swept away the Chiang bandits east and north of Huangpi from the 5th to the 11th, successively capturing strongholds such as Liuzigang, Baliwan, Changxuanling, and Lijiaji, and thoroughly destroying the middle section of the highway from Huangpi to Hekou and other towns. The Eyu People's Liberation Army captured Xixian on the north bank of the Huai River on the 27th. Local people's armed forces in various places actively cooperated with the Liberation Army to clear out local Chiang bandits. The local armed forces of the Jianghan Military Region alone annihilated six pseudo-township offices such as Longwan and parts of the Jiangling Security Team and the Zaoyang Police Security Team in the areas of Zaoyang, Yicheng, and Jiangling in the first half of the month. In the first ten days of January, the local armed forces of the Tongbai Military Region launched suppression campaigns against local Chiang bandits in Tongbai, Biyang, and Xinye, fighting a total of ten battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 222 of them. The West Anhui local armed forces fought in the areas of Zhuwumiao (Yuexi), Taihu, Lujiang, and east of Susong, and south of Huoshan from the 1st to the 13th, annihilating more than 600 Chiang bandits. The Eyu local armed forces annihilated the Wang Mizhou squadron of the Lihuang County Security Brigade and the ninth battalion of the returning home team of the Chiang bandits at Sun's Ancestral Hall south of Jinjiazhai (Lihuang) and Juanpengqiao southeast of Macheng within the two days of New Year's Day, January 1st and 2nd. According to incomplete statistics: the Liberation Army and local armed forces fought a total of 190 large and small battles in January, annihilating parts of the Chiang bandit's regular army 25th Division, 28th Division, 58th Division, and 46th Division, totaling 1,126 people, and annihilating 13,893 local Chiang bandits, including killing Wang Qianyi, deputy commander of the Wanxi Joint Defense Second Detachment of the Henan Provincial Self-Defense General Team and concurrently commander of the Deng County Joint Defense Command, and Wang De'an, deputy leader of the battlefield inspection team with the rank of major general, and 3,200 workers, capturing He Shiyun, commander of the Security Regiment of the Third Special Office of Hubei Province, and Zhou Qizhuan, leader of the battlefield inspection team with the rank of major general, and 10,691 others. A total of 15,019 Chiang bandit regular troops and local Chiang bandits were annihilated. More than 30 important towns were captured, and 21 artillery pieces, 209 light and heavy machine guns, 19 grenade launchers, and 11,262 long and short guns of various types were seized. Twenty li of the Ping-Han Road from Huayuan to Yangjiazhai was destroyed, and more than 90 li of highways from Hekou to Huangpi, Changxuanling to Yaojiaji, and Da'an to Hefei were destroyed. The achievements of one month fully prove that in the land reform movement, the strength of the people of Eyuwan is growing stronger day by day, and any \"offensive\" and \"sweeping\" of the Chiang bandits will be crushed by the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 土地改革中人民力量日益壮大  鄂豫皖上月歼匪万五千\n\n1948-02-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    土地改革中人民力量日益壮大\n    鄂豫皖上月歼匪万五千\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十五日电】前线记者综合报导：一九四八年的第一个月份里，鄂豫皖人民解放军及鄂豫、皖西、江汉、桐柏各军区人民地方武装到处主动歼灭蒋匪军及扫荡土蒋匪获得辉煌战绩。一月七日江汉解放军解放随县，歼灭蒋匪湖北省保安第四总队和伪专员公署、县政府等，使江汉、桐柏两解放区连成一片。并在四日攻克长江北岸的麻市拐、红沟市，廿日攻克汉水东岸的东津湾，震骇了江南汉西的蒋匪，襄阳宣布紧急戒严。解放军又于十六日解放了宛西蒋匪反动堡垒之一的邓县，全歼蒋匪十一个保安团。活跃于汉口外围的解放军则在五日至十一日内横扫黄陂以东以北之蒋匪，先后攻克柳子港、八里湾、长轩岭、李家集等据点，并将黄陂至河口等镇公路中段彻底破坏。鄂豫人民解放军则于二十七日攻克淮河北岸之息县。各地人民地方武装积极配合解放军扫清地方土蒋，江汉军区地方武装仅在上半月内即在枣阳、宜城、江陵等地区歼灭龙湾等六个伪乡公所及江陵保安队、枣阳警保队一部。桐柏军区地方武装一月上旬在桐柏、泌阳、新野各地进剿土蒋，共作战十次，毙伤俘其二百二十二名。皖西地方武装一日至十三日在朱屋庙（岳西）太湖、庐江及宿松以东，霍山以南地区作战，共歼蒋匪六百余名。鄂豫地方武装在元旦一、二两日内即在金家寨（立煌）以南的孙家祠堂及麻城东南的卷棚桥将蒋匪立煌县保安大队汪密周中队及第九营还乡队歼灭。以上据不完全统计：解放军和地方武装在一月份内共进行大小战斗一百九十次，歼蒋匪正规军整二十五师、二十八师、五十八师、四十六师等各一部共一千一百二十六人，歼土蒋匪一万三千八百九十三人，其中毙敌河南省自卫总队宛西联防第二支队兼邓县联防指挥部副指挥官王乾一及战地视察小组少将副组长王德安以下三千二百零工人，活捉湖北省第三专署保安团司令何时运及战地视察组少将组长周齐专以下一万零六百九十一人。以上总共歼灭蒋匪正规军及土蒋匪一万五千零十九人。攻克重要城镇三十余处，缴获各种炮二十一门、轻重机枪二百零九挺、掷弹筒十九个、长短枪一万一千二百六十二支。破坏平汉路花园至杨家寨一段二十里，河口至黄陂、长轩岭至姚家集、大安至合肥等公路共九十余里。一个月的战绩，充分证明了在土地改革运动中，鄂豫皖人民力量的日愈壮大，蒋匪任何的“进攻”“扫荡”，都将被人民所粉碎。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editorial\n\n    The Southeast Asian Youth Conference, convened by the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Student Union, will open in Calcutta on February 15th. We extend our heartfelt congratulations from afar.\n\n    At the beginning of the New Year of 1948, youth representatives from Southeast Asian countries gather to work towards opposing imperialism, striving for the independence and freedom of Southeast Asian countries, and expanding and consolidating the world youth anti-imperialist united front. This is of great significance.\n\n    After the world's people, through unprecedented arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice, defeated the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist bandits who attempted to enslave the world, the reactionaries of various countries, headed by American imperialists, replaced the position of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, forming an imperialist anti-democratic camp, attempting to enslave the people of the world. The US imperialist policy of world expansion was drafted under the conspiracy to gain world domination and destroy all democratic forces. It attempts to ultimately push the world's people into the abyss of poverty and darkness. Having undergone the severe test of World War II, the increasingly awakened and united people of all countries, with the socialist Soviet Union at the head, have formed another world-scale camp, which is the democratic anti-imperialist camp. The colonial and semi-colonial East, possessing more than half of the world's population and rich treasures, has always been an important target of imperialist exploitation; now it is an important target of exploitation by American imperialism and British, French, and Dutch imperialism. Therefore, the anti-imperialist united front of the Eastern people is an important component of the world people's anti-imperialist united front, and the national democratic movement of the Southeast Asian people is an important part of the Eastern people's anti-imperialist united front.\n\n    The national democratic movement of the Southeast Asian people has a glorious tradition. As early as before the Pacific War, the national independence movements in these countries had already flourished. After the Japanese imperialists invaded Southeast Asian countries in December 1941, many people in these countries who were unwilling to be enslaved either armed themselves or enthusiastically joined the Allied forces and fought heroically against Japanese imperialism, finally winning victory. After Japan's surrender, the situation in Southeast Asia underwent new changes. On the one hand, the level of awareness of the people of Southeast Asian countries increased unprecedentedly during World War II. The people of Southeast Asian countries realized from their own practical experience that as long as the people of all countries unite domestically and internationally, any powerful imperialist oppressor can be overthrown. At the same time, the organizational strength and struggle experience of the people of all countries have also been unprecedentedly enriched. After the defeat of Japanese imperialism, popular armed struggles against imperialist aggression and demanding national independence have been constantly growing and developing in Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, and the Philippines. This just armed struggle will not cease until the goal of completely breaking free from the shackles of imperialism is achieved. On the other hand, British, French, and Dutch imperialism were greatly weakened in World War II, and their rule in Southeast Asia was on the verge of collapse. American imperialism took advantage of this opportunity to gradually infiltrate, colluding with the aforementioned imperialists and the internal reactionary groups of various countries such as Roxas, Phibun, and Bảo Đại, attempting to use various means to curb the increasingly high tide of national awakening, in order to achieve its goal of economically and politically enslaving the people of Southeast Asia. Towards Indonesia, American imperialists, on the one hand, provided material, weapons, and financial assistance to Dutch imperialism to carry out a counter-revolutionary war of aggression, and bought over Indonesian reactionaries to split the Indonesian national camp. At the same time, American imperialists carried out so-called \"mediation,\" attempting to deceive the Indonesian people and force them to submit. Towards Vietnam, American imperialists assisted French imperialism in carrying out a war of aggression, and French imperialists attempted to support the puppet Bảo Đại to divide the Vietnamese people. Towards the Philippines, American imperialists supported the Roxas puppet government, giving the Philippines a laughable \"independence.\" At the same time, they helped the puppet Roxas to \"encircle and suppress\" the People's Anti-Japanese Army, which truly represents the Filipino people. Towards Siam, American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang instigated Phibun's reactionary coup, attempting to establish a reactionary center in Southeast Asia in Siam. The British imperialists, through the so-called \"partition\" of India, provoked the Indian and Muslim people to carry out large-scale, cruel mutual killings, and assassinated Indian leader Gandhi, thus proving the slander that \"the Indian people cannot govern themselves\" in order to continue to rule India. Towards Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, and Singapore, the British imperialists either gave them false \"independence\"; or nominal autonomy; or maintained their original form of rule. These imperialist conspiracies are well-known facts. Thus, in Southeast Asian countries, the struggle between the imperialist camp and the democratic camp is proceeding extremely fiercely. The imperialists' conspiracies will never deceive or intimidate the people of Southeast Asian countries, whose political awareness has been greatly enhanced. Although the process of the struggle of the Southeast Asian people is arduous, long-term, and tortuous, the strength of the people of all countries is growing. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Ho Chi Minh, controls most of the mountainous areas except for the coastal plains of Annam, and persists in a long-term war of resistance. The Burmese people, led by the Burmese Communist Party, established a democratic regime between Yangon and Mandalay, and unyieldingly persist in the armed struggle for independence and liberation. The Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army, led by Taruc, established democratic regimes in provinces such as Bulacan and Quezon, carried out land reform, and persisted in the war of independence. The Indonesian People's Liberation War is in full swing. Although this time, due to the wavering of upper-level elements, it accepted the humiliating \"Renville\" agreement, we believe that the heroic Indonesian people with struggle experience will surely see through the conspiracy of the American and Dutch imperialists colluding with each other and the surrender and humiliation of internal wavering elements, and will continue to fight. In addition, the people of India, Siam, Malaya, and other places are launching large-scale national democratic movements. Singaporean workers, in opposition to Canada's military aid to Chiang, have always insisted on refusing to transport goods for Canadian ships loaded with munitions, expressing great international friendship to the Chinese people. The great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people's anti-American and anti-Chiang independent democratic movement are undoubtedly a huge encouragement and help to the people of Southeast Asian countries. The strength of the people of Southeast Asian countries is incomparably stronger than before World War II, and the future of the people of Southeast Asian countries is very bright.\n\n    Looking at the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries, their outward strength but inner weakness and their growing unpopularity are increasingly prominent. Among the imperialist countries that are invading Southeast Asian countries, the French and Dutch imperialists are already on the verge of collapse, and the British imperialists face many difficulties. American imperialism appears to be the most powerful and is the last pillar of other imperialists and reactionaries in Southeast Asian countries. However, American imperialism is already facing an unavoidable economic crisis that is about to arrive soon, and is opposed by democratic forces around the world. After World War II, the world capitalist system is more fragmented and more corrupt than ever before, and there are growing and developing people's democratic forces within these countries.\n\n    Even so, we must never underestimate the enemy in specific practical struggles. Comrade Mao Zedong said: \"All anti-imperialist forces in Eastern countries should unite to oppose the oppression of imperialism and internal reactionaries, and strive for the liberation of the more than one billion oppressed people in the East as the goal of struggle. We must completely control our own destiny ourselves, and we should eliminate all weak and incompetent thinking within ourselves.\" This is not only for the victory of China's national liberation and democratic revolution, but also for the liberation and victory of all oppressed nations in the East, which is an extremely important inspiration for the liberation struggle in Southeast Asian countries.\n\n    Today, the most urgent task placed before the people of the East is how to unite all anti-imperialist forces in Eastern countries to oppose the oppression of imperialism and internal reactionaries, to strive for the liberation of the more than one billion oppressed people in the East as the goal of struggle, and for this goal, within the national democratic camps of various countries, to eliminate all compromise thoughts that fear imperialism, especially fear American imperialism and dare not struggle against it and resist its oppression, and to eliminate all obstacles that hinder united struggle against imperialism and reactionaries of various countries.\n\n    In this regard, the Chinese people provide the people of Eastern countries with extremely valuable experience: When Japan surrendered, American imperialists in the East, especially in China, were arrogant and domineering, blatantly instigating Chiang Kai-shek to tear up the Kuomintang-Communist truce agreement, just as Dutch imperialism tore up the Linggadjati Agreement and French imperialism tore up the agreement with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and openly aided Chiang in carrying out a large-scale civil war. But at that time, the Chinese Communist Party had already pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek would be defeated, the People's Liberation Army would win, American imperialism was a paper tiger and not to be feared, and could be opposed. Now, the Chinese People's Liberation War has been going on for a year and a half, Chiang Kai-shek has lost 1.87 million troops and retreated to the Yangtze River basin. Since Japan's surrender, the American aid to Chiang in the form of munitions, materials, and loans has reached more than 230 million US dollars, which cannot save Chiang Kai-shek's fate of defeat. Can giving another 570 million US dollars today exempt him from destruction? Absolutely not. This will only arouse greater anger among the Chinese people, cause greater opposition from the people and democratic youth around the world, and China's democratic revolution will surely win the final victory.\n\n    The convening of this Southeast Asian Youth Conference will be a prelude to the further expansion and consolidation of the Southeast Asian national democratic movement and the anti-imperialist united front of the Eastern people. In this great and glorious undertaking, the youth of Southeast Asian countries still have a huge responsibility and will surely be able to pave the way for the realization of this cause.\n\n    We wish the conference a successful victory.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 庆祝东南亚青年代表大会开幕\n\n1948-02-17\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社社论\n\n    庆祝东南亚青年代表大会开幕\n    由世界民主青年联盟与国际学联召开的东南亚青年代表大会将于二月十五日在加尔各答开幕，我们衷心地遥致祝贺之忱。\n    际此一九四八年新春，东南亚洲各国青年代表济济一堂，为反对帝国主义争取东南亚各国的独立自由，及扩大与巩固世界青年反帝统一战线而努力，实具有伟大的意义。\n    世界人民以史无前例的艰苦奋斗与英勇牺牲，战胜了企图奴役世界的德、意、日法西斯匪帮以后，以美国帝国主义者为首的各国反动派，代替了德、意、日法西斯的地位，组成帝国主义的反民主的阵营，企图奴役世界人民；美帝国主义的世界扩张政策，是在为了取得世界统治权及摧毁一切民主力量的阴谋下拟就的，它企图把世界人民最终推入贫困与黑暗的深渊。经历过第二次世界大战严重考验的日趋觉悟与团结的各国人民，以社会主义苏联为首形成了另一个世界规模的阵营，这就是民主的反帝国主义的阵营。殖民地与半殖民地的东方，拥有占世界一半以上的人口和丰富的宝藏，一直是帝国主义榨取的重要对象；现在则是美国帝国主义和英法荷兰等帝国主义榨取的重要对象。所以东方人民的反帝统一战线，是世界人民反帝统一战线的重要组成部分，而东南亚人民的民族民主运动，又是东方人民反帝统一战线的重要部分。\n    东南亚人民的民族民主运动，有着光辉的传统。早在太平洋战争以前，这些国家的民族独立运动就已经蓬蓬勃勃地展开了，至一九四一年十二月日本帝国主义侵入东南亚各国以后，许多国家里不愿被奴役的人民，或则自己武装起来，或则踊跃参加盟国的军队，对日本帝国主义进行了英勇的搏斗，终于获得胜利。日本投降后，东南亚的情势起了新的变化、一方面是东南亚各国人民在第二次世界大战中觉悟程度空前提高，东南亚各国人民从自己的实际经验中了解到：只要各国人民在国内和国际的规模上团结起来，任何强大的帝国主义压迫者是可以打倒的。同时各国人民的组织力量与斗争经验也空前的丰富了，反抗帝国主义侵略，要求民族独立的人民武装斗争，在日本帝国主义被打败之后，在印尼，在越南，在缅甸，在菲律宾都在不断的生长和发展。这种正义的武装斗争，不达到完全挣脱帝国主义枷锁的目的，是不会休止的。另一方面，则是英法荷帝国主义在第二次大战中大为削弱，他们在东南亚的统治摇摇欲坠，美帝国主义利用这个机会，逐步侵入，与上述帝国主义及罗哈斯、銮披汶、保大等各国内部的反动集团勾结一起，企图以各种手段阻遏日益高涨的民族觉醒的巨流，以达其在经济上、政治上奴役东南亚人民的目的。对于印尼，美国帝国主义者一方面以物资武器与金钱援助荷兰帝国主义，进行反革命的侵略战争，并收买印尼的反动派以分裂印尼民族阵营。同时，美国帝国主义者又进行所谓“调处”，企图以此欺骗印尼人民和压迫印尼人民就范。对于越南，美帝国主义者援助法国帝国主义进行侵略战争，法国帝国主义者并企图扶植傀儡保大，来分化越南人民。对于菲律宾，美帝国主义者扶植了罗哈斯傀儡政府，给菲律宾以可笑的“独立”。同时帮助傀儡罗哈斯，对真正代表菲律宾人民的民抗军进行“围剿”。对于暹罗，美国帝国主义与蒋介石匪帮策动了銮披汶的反动政变，企图在暹罗建立东南亚的反动中心。英国帝国主义，对于印度所谓“分治”的办法，挑起印回人民进行大规模的惨酷的相互残杀，并谋杀了印度领袖甘地，这样来证明所谓“印度人民不能自治”的谰言，以便继续统治印度。对于缅甸、锡兰、马来亚和新加坡，英国帝国主义者或者给以虚假的“独立”；或者给以名义上的自治；或者仍原封不动地维持其原来的统治形式。这些帝国主义的阴谋，都是人所共知的事实。这样在东南亚各国，帝国主义阵营与民主阵营之间的斗争，是正在极其激烈地进行着。帝国主义的阴谋是决不能欺骗与吓退政治觉悟已经大大提高了的东南亚各国人民的，东南亚各国人民的斗争虽然其过程是艰苦的，长期的和曲折的，但各国人民的力量，是正在生长起来。以胡志明为首的越南人民共和国，控制了除安南沿海平原以外的大部分山地，坚持长期抗战。缅甸人民以缅共为首在仰光与曼德勒之间，成立了民主政权，不屈不挠地坚持着独立解放的武装斗争。菲律宾民抗军以塔拉克为首，在布拉干、奎松等省，建立民主政权，进行土地改革，坚持独立战争。如火如荼的印尼人民解放战争，此次虽因内部上层分子的动摇，接受了屈辱的“伦维尔”协定，但我们相信具有斗争经验的英勇的印尼人民，必会洞烛美荷帝国主义狼狈为奸的阴谋及内部动摇分子的投降屈辱，而仍将继续战斗。此外，印度、暹罗、马来亚等地人民，正在展开大规模的民族民主运动，新加坡工人为反对加拿大军事援蒋，始终坚持拒绝为装载军火的加轮起运货物，对中国人民表示了伟大的国际友情。中国人民解放军的伟大胜利，及人民反美反蒋的独立民主运动，对于东南亚各国人民，毫无疑问的是巨大的鼓舞与帮助。东南亚各国人民的力量，比之第二次世界大战以前，已经强大得不可比拟，东南亚各国人民的前途是十分光明的。\n    反观帝国主义与各国反动派，其外强中干众叛亲离日益显著，在侵略东南亚各国的帝国主义国家中，法荷两个帝国主义者，已经摇摇欲坠，英国帝国主义者面前困难重重；美国帝国主义表面上确是最为强大，并且是其他帝国主义者与东南亚各国反动派的最后支柱，然而美国帝国主义者已经面临着很快就要到来的无法摆脱的经济危机，并且遭到全世界民主力量的反对。第二次世界大战之后，世界资本主义的体系，是较之以往更加支离破碎了，更加腐朽不堪了，而这些国家内部又存在着日益强大和发展的人民民主力量。\n    虽然如此，我们决不应该在具体的实际的斗争中稍为轻视敌人。毛泽东同志说：“东方各国一切反帝国主义的力量，应当团结起来，反对帝国主义及各国内部反动派的压迫，以东方十万万以上被压迫人民获得解放为斗争的目标。我们自己的命运完全应当由我们自己来掌握，我们应当在自己内部，肃清一切软弱无能的思想。”这不仅是为了中国民族解放与民主革命的胜利，也是为了东方一切被压迫民族的解放与胜利，这对于东南亚各国的解放斗争，是极其重要的启示。\n    今天放在我们东方人民面前的最迫切的任务，就是如何把东方各国一切反帝国主义的力量团结起来，反对帝国主义及各国内部反动派的压迫，以东方十万万以上被压迫人民获得解放为奋斗的目标，并为此目标在各国民族民主阵营的内部，肃清一切惧怕帝国主义，尤其惧怕美帝国主义不敢与之进行斗争反抗其压迫的妥协思想，清除一切妨碍团结起来向帝国主义和各国反动派进行斗争的障碍。\n    中国人民在这方面，提供东方各国人民一个极其宝贵的经验：当着日本投降以后，美帝国主义者在东方，尤其在中国骄横得不可一世，明目张胆地唆使蒋介石撕毁国共停战协定，好象荷兰帝国主义撕毁林加牙蒂协定，法帝国主义撕毁与越南人民共和国的协定一样，公开援蒋进行大规模的内战。但就在那个时候，中国共产党已经指出蒋介石必败，人民解放军必胜，美帝国主义是纸老虎不足怕，并且是可以反对下去的。现在，中国人民解放战争进行一年半，蒋介石已损失了一百八十七万军队，败退到长江流域。自日本投降到现在，美国援蒋的军火、物资、借款已达二十三万万余美元之巨，竟不能挽救蒋介石失败的命运，难道今天再给五亿七千万美元，就能免其覆灭吗？绝对不会，这只能激起中国人民更大的愤怒，引起全世界人民和民主青年更大的反对，而中国的民主革命必将获得最后胜利。\n    此次东南亚青年代表大会的召开，将是东南亚民族民主运动与东方人民反帝统一战线进一步扩大与巩固的先声，在这个伟大的光荣的事业中，东南亚各国的青年，还有巨大的责任，而且一定能够为这个事业的实现开辟道路。\n    我们预祝大会胜利成功。"

It issued a statement calling on the people to establish a national democratic front to defend national independence and democracy.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: Tokyo dispatch: JCP leader Okano Susumu recently fiercely criticized Katayama's supplementary budget proposal at a meeting of the Diet Budget Committee. Okano Susumu pointed out that the Katayama government's method of balancing the budget deliberately sacrifices the interests of the broad masses and places the entire burden of the economic crisis on the shoulders of the Japanese workers and peasants. He also revealed that Japan's inflation is worsening, and the amount of currency in circulation is increasing daily. The reactionary Japanese government not only did not try to alleviate this situation, but instead exacerbated it. Okano Susumu pointed out that when the Katayama cabinet passed tax increases and raised train ticket prices, postage rates, and telegram fees, it argued that there was no other source of revenue. But in fact, the Japanese government has always subsidized coal mine owners while selling coal to private companies at prices below the cost of production. For example, the state-owned railway paid 1,209 yen per ton of coal, but the Katayama government sold it to private companies at an official price of 800 yen per ton. As a result, the state-owned railway lost 6 billion yen, while private companies made huge profits. Okano Susumu concluded that the Japanese working people oppose the government's financial policy because it benefits monopoly capital. The Government Employees' Union Federation has mobilized 300,000 people to jointly protest the government's supplementary budget proposal.\n\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th: According to a semi-official US news agency, United Press, Nanjing, February 9th: A high-ranking Chiang Kai-shek bandit official admitted that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government has \"fully agreed\" and \"supported\" its American masters' vicious plan to \"revive the Japanese economy\" and maintain its enormous war potential, restoring Japanese industry to the production level of 1930 to 1934, the eve of the \"July 7th\" Incident when Japan was actively preparing to launch a large-scale war of aggression against China. According to this plan, Japan will retain an annual steel production of 3.5 million tons; 75,000 tons of ammonia (nitrogen); 3.5 million tons of sulfuric acid; 85,000 tons of soda ash; 650,000 tons of caustic soda; 27,000 machine tools; 15,000 steel rolling mills; 2 million kilowatts of thermal power; 150,000 tons of shipbuilding; and 5 million tons of ship repair. United Press stated that Zhu Shiming, former head of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit delegation to Japan, also published an article in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit Central Daily News on the 8th, reflecting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's consistent attitude with US imperialism on the Japan issue.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日共中央举行全体会议  号召建立全国民主阵线  冈野进抨击片山政府危害群众\n\n1948-02-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    日共中央举行全体会议\n    号召建立全国民主阵线\n    冈野进抨击片山政府危害群众\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】东京讯：据赤旗报称：日本共产党中央委员会近举行全体会议，讨论了国内政治形势和巩固民主及组织统一战线的任务；并发表声明：号召人民建立全国民主阵线，保卫国家独立和民主。\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】东京讯；日共领袖冈野进日前在议会预算委员会会议上，猛烈抨击片山之追加预算案。冈野进指出：片山政府平衡预算的办法，是有意地牺牲广大群众的利益，将经济危机的整个担子压在日本工农大众身上。并揭露称：日本的通货膨胀愈加恶劣，纸币流通额逐日增加，日本反动政府不仅没有设法使之缓和，反而加重这种情况。冈野进指出：片山内阁通过增税及提高火车票价、邮资和电报费时，曾强词夺理，谓除此之外，别无财源；但事实上，日本政府始终一面以款项补助煤矿业主，一面又按低于生产成本的价格，将煤售予私营公司。例如：国有铁道付出的煤价是每吨一千二百零九日元，片山政府则以官价每吨八百日元卖给私营公司。结果，国营铁道亏空六十亿日元，而私营公司则盈利极大。冈野进最后称：日本劳动人民反对政府的财政政策，因其为独点资本谋利益，政府机关员工联合会已发动三十万人，联合抗议政府的追加预算案。\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】据美半官方通讯社合众社九日南京讯：蒋匪某高级官员供认，蒋介石卖国政府，业已“完全同意”和“支持”其美国主子“复兴日本经济”，使其保有庞大的战争潜力的恶毒计划，将日本工业恢复到一九三○年至一九三四年，即“七七”事变前夜日本积极准备发动大规模侵华战争时期的生产水平。按照这一计划，日本将保有每年钢铁生产量三百五十万吨；淡气（氮）七万五千吨；硫酸三百五十万吨，灰碱八万五千吨；烧碱六十五万吨；工作机二万七千台，辗钢机一万五千吨；火电二百万千瓦；造船十五万吨；修船五百万吨。合众社称：前蒋匪驻日代表团长朱世明八日在蒋匪中央日报发表文章，亦反映了蒋匪在对日问题上与美帝一致的态度。"

    "content": "Peasants:\n\n    Our newspaper welcomes everyone to come here and denounce the crimes of the landlords, expose shortcomings in our work, promote the good and appropriate things that we peasants believe in, and put forward our own demands and suggestions for improving our work. All institutions, organizations, and individuals mentioned by everyone must express their attitude. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to everyone's opinions should accept and implement them. If there are any inaccuracies, explanations can be made, and differing opinions can be presented. Those who can write should write themselves. Those who cannot write can ask the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write, or they can personally come to the newspaper office. If that's not possible, write a letter to the newspaper and let us know, and we can figure out a way.\n\n    The current chief of the Ninth District of Wu'an, Wang Yurong, is a big stone weighing down the peasants. Wang Qingyun and other poor peasants from Nanxi Village accuse him of exploiting the peasants.\n\n    Wang Yurong is from Nanxi Village, Wu'an. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the first director of the farmers' association in Xijing (before Nanxi and Beixi Villages were separated). Later, he served as a town chief and district cadre. He \"compromised\" twice (returned home to be an ordinary peasant). According to Wang Jufu, who worked as a hired laborer for his third uncle, his grandfather, Wang Jiuyang, farmed sixty mu of land and had a mule, a donkey, and two oxen. He hired a long-term laborer and also raised a large flock of sheep. In the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1923 or 1924), the family divided into three branches. Wang Yurong's second uncle and third uncle (named Wang Tongchang, who was struggled against in 1946) both hired long-term laborers. Wang Yurong's father, Wang Qiu Zi, relied on his own labor because he had more manpower. According to labor hero Zhang Jiajun, \"Later, his second uncle's opium addiction ruined him, and he sold seven mu of land to Wang Yurong's father.\" In the thirteenth or fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Wang Yurong and his four brothers divided the family property, each receiving seven mu of land (according to Zhang Jiajun). Hao Guitian, the deputy village chief of Nanxi Village, said about Wang Yurong's distribution of fruit last year, \"According to his status, he shouldn't have been entitled to a share because he's a worker's family member. But he got a lot. The first distribution was 9,000 yuan per share, so three shares were 27,000 yuan. The second time, it was 1,500 yuan per share, and he also got three shares. The highest share in the village was only ten shares.\" According to poor peasant Wang Gongliang, \"Wang Yurong currently has ten mu of land (including six mu of good land, with a total output of over ten shi, enough for three people to eat), divided into five plots, each cultivated by two or three families. The village treats his family the same as families of revolutionary martyrs, assigning labor for planting, gathering firewood, carrying water, milling rice, transporting coal, etc.\"\n\n    Regarding Wang Yurong's time as town chief, political director Hu Tingxuan said: At that time, most people didn't dare to gamble, but as long as he was involved, they could gamble. He collected 500 yuan as a \"head fee\" for each \"treasure\" game. He took one-tenth of the \"banmian\" (a type of gambling). At that time, rice cost five mao per jin, so he earned 1,000 jin of rice per \"treasure\" game. During his time as town chief, he became very close to the landlords. Landlords gave him gifts and treated him to meals. Because the accounts were unclear, the masses wanted to oppose his corruption, so he feigned illness and returned home to be an ordinary peasant. This was his first \"compromise.\" Later, he was transferred back to work in the district.\n\n    In 1944, he was a district cadre in the Second District. Whether it was due to poor food or other reasons, he feigned illness and returned home. After returning, he often sought medical treatment from doctor Hu Zezhi (a landlord). He told Hu Zezhi, \"When the cadres ask me, just say I'm sick!\" In fact, he wasn't sick. The county government, unaware of the details, gave him an unknown amount of grain for his illness. He already had grain stored himself. At that time, the famine hadn't passed, and people had no food to eat, so he took the opportunity to start lending at high interest rates. According to Hu Tingxuan, he was the only person in the village lending money, with interest rates as high as 30% per month and as low as 12.5% per month. He lent money in two ways: one was lending cash. Because the peasants are still afraid of him, they dare not admit that they borrowed money from him, so all his materials have not yet been gathered. According to preliminary statistics, he lent 5,900 yuan to just five debtors (all poor peasants): Wang Cunshan, Wang Daheng, Wang Zhenqing, Guo Yuqing, and Wang Dingyi. Except for Guo Yuqing's 600 yuan, which was at an interest rate of 12.5% per month, the others were all at an interest rate of 1,000 yuan, with a daily interest of 100 yuan, equivalent to 30% per month. The other way was \"buying licenses.\" Before the wheat and autumn harvests, when there was a shortage of food, he would lend wheat or millet to the peasants. After the wheat and autumn harvests, in less than two months, they would have to pay back double. This was called \"buying licenses.\" Six poor peasants, Guo Yuqing, Gao Changfu, Wang Qingyun, Wang Dingguo, Wang Cunling, and Wang Kuiyou, borrowed 175 jin of rice and wheat from him, plus 15 jin of millet (partial materials).\n\n    That year, when the masses were mobilized, they couldn't hold back their anger and demanded the clearing of Wang Yurong's accounts. At that time, Wang Yurong and a standing committee member of the farmers' association were in a mutual aid team together, and they were very close. The farmers' association arranged to struggle against Wang Yurong, and this standing committee member tipped Wang Yurong off. Wang Yurong, seeing that the situation was not good, infiltrated the farmers' association, pulled in some of the masses, and made the masses and cadres afraid to express their opinions. He thus sabotaged the peasants' attempt to clear his accounts. As a result, some secretly repaid the principal and interest, while others only repaid the principal and not the interest. Wang Yurong was not convinced. He also collected the opinions of landlords who had already had their rent and interest reduced, attempting to attack the cadres, but he did not succeed. According to Shen Guilin (from Beixi Village), deputy director of the Wu'an Military Committee in the Sixth District, last autumn, he and Liu Degui, the district chief of the Sixth District, visited Wang Yurong's house. Afterward, they casually commented that Wang Yurong's house was nicely decorated. The masses said, \"He earned the money from lending!\" They had also heard that the interest rates were high, but they didn't ask about it, and of course, they didn't deal with it.\n\n    According to labor hero Zhang Jiajun, Wang Yurong not only lent money at high interest rates but also bought green crops at low prices during famine years, for which he was criticized by the government. The situation was this: That year, during the famine, the poor households of the Wang family jointly opened up a large graveyard and planted green crops. However, they were too hungry, so Wang Yurong took the opportunity to buy the green crops at a low price (reportedly for only 300 yuan). The county government felt that Wang Yurong was a cadre and that it was too harsh of him to do this, so they ordered him to give the grain from the green crops to the poor households. It is unknown whether he did so.\n\n    Guo Yinhe, a refugee, also mentioned that in the famine year, Wang Yurong also bought more than two mu of land from his uncle Guo Qiyin at a low price. Because of the poor harvest, the poor peasants ate the grain from the farmers' association (this was relief grain transported by the government from Shanxi, which was given to grain transporters by the farmers' association to keep and eat). They had no way to repay it all, so they had to sell the land to Wang Yurong.\n\n    Wang Yurong not only lent money at high interest rates, exploited the peasants, and sabotaged the peasants' attempts to clear his accounts but also helped the landlords retaliate against the peasants. According to political director Hu Tingxuan, in 1944, during the rent reduction and debt clearing campaign, Nanxi Village struggled against the big landlord Hu Qitang. (According to Song Zhanlin, who was once the chairman of the Wu'an County Farmers' Association, Hu Qitang once returned 270 shi of rent, making him the largest landlord in Xijing.) Hu Qitang's third son was Wang Yurong's godson. When Wang Yurong returned to the village, Hu Qitang said to him, \"I wasn't harmed when you were working in the village. As soon as you left, there was rent reduction and debt clearing, and I was defeated. Wang Juwen made too many criticisms.\" Upon hearing this, Wang Yurong found Ji Hong, the chairman of the district salvation association residing in the village, and Wang Wuxiang, a district cadre, and said, \"Wang Juwen is not a good person. He hates the landlord, but he shouldn't have asked the masses for money to marry his wife.\" Wang Juwen was a poor peasant. He married a widow and needed to spend more than twenty yuan to buy clothes, but he couldn't afford it. Ten village cadres, sympathizing with his difficulties, each helped him with five yuan. This was the truth about Wang Yurong's claim that Wang Juwen asked the masses for money to marry his wife. Ji Hong, unaware of the details, fell for Wang Yurong's trick. As a result, Wang Juwen was struggled against. Wang Yurong personally controlled the meeting, preventing village cadres from participating, and put a \"corruption\" label on Wang Juwen and detained him. Later, the village cadres released him.\n\n    After Wang Yurong \"compromised\" for the second time and returned home, he did so many bad things. After he was transferred to work in Wudong County, according to Zhang Jiajun, he even asked the landlord Hu Yunting to lend money at high interest rates on his behalf. That year, the government sent people to investigate and discovered that the landlord Hu Yunting was lending at high interest rates, and the capital came from Wang Yurong. At a mass meeting in Nanxi Village, Li Fuchang, a section chief from the county government, scolded Hu Yunting, saying, \"Your friend (referring to Wang Yurong) is not worth a fart!\" At that time, the government only criticized Wang Yurong and did not dismiss him from his position. He continued to serve as a cadre and rule the masses, and the honest peasants dared not say a word.\n\n    According to poor peasant Wang Qingyun, in the first lunar month of 1945, Wang Yurong bought manure from his family (two yuan per load) and asked Wang Yuqing to carry it. Wang Yuqing found three small lambs in the manure and told him about it. Wang Yurong said, \"Just say there were ten lambs.\" Then, Wang Yurong spread the word on the street that Wang Qingyun's father, Wang Yincheng (nicknamed Lao Chuzi), had slaughtered more than ten ewes, and reported it to the county government's judicial office, which was stationed in Jianshan Village at the time. On the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, Wang Yincheng was arrested and detained for ten days. He was fined 12,000 yuan (at that time, a sheep cost 50 yuan). Wang Yincheng returned home on the twenty-fourth day of the first lunar month, and, frightened and angered, he fell ill on the twenty-fifth day and died on the first day of the second lunar month. Wang Yurong carried twelve more loads of manure, and when Wang Qingyun went to ask for payment, he refused to pay.\n\n    According to Hu Tingxuan, in the spring of 1946, the house of the landlord Wang Shijie was confiscated. Wang Yueyou (a new middle peasant), a refugee who had returned from Anze, wanted to buy it, and Hao Guitian, the deputy village chief, also wanted to buy it. Wang Yurong's wife sent a message to Wang Yurong (who was working in Longwu Village, more than ten li away), and Wang Yurong said that he wanted to buy the house. As a result, no one dared to buy it, and Wang Yurong bought it. Where did the money come from? According to Song Zhanlin (from Longwu Village, currently recovering at home), who was once the chairman of the Wu'an County Farmers' Association, the money came from Wang Yurong's share of the fruits of struggle in Longwu Village. He said: During the movement in the spring of 1946, Wang Yurong was working in Longwu and bought some tables, cabinets, and other items. It is unknown whether he paid for them. During the second distribution of the fruits of struggle, Wang Yurong also allocated two shares for himself (10,000 yuan per share). Li Jingnan, another district cadre working in Longwu, disagreed, but it didn't have any effect. When announcing the share distribution at the farmers' association meeting, he didn't announce Wang Yurong's name. As a result, he took 20,000 yuan from the village chief, Ren Mingxing. Later, during the collective self-criticism of the village cadres, the village chief initially denied it, but after everyone pressed him, he admitted it.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武安九区区长王玉荣  要老老实实反省错误\n王清云  薛风\n1948-02-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    武安九区区长王玉荣\n    要老老实实反省错误\n    贫农王清云等谈  薛风代笔\n    农民们：\n    我们报纸，欢迎大家在这里控诉地主的罪恶，揭发工作中的缺点，发扬那些咱们农民认为好的、合适的事情，提出自己的要求和改进工作的意见。凡是大家提出的机关、团体、个人，他们都要表示态度。该作检讨的作检讨，该按照大家意见办事的要接受下来办。有不对的地方可以作解释，提出不同的意见。大家会写的，就自己写。不会写的，可以找报馆的通讯员、记者和当地的干部写，要不就亲自来报馆跑一趟，再不行，写个信给报馆，打个招呼，我们就可以想办法。\n    现任武安九区区长王玉荣，是压制农民的一块大石板。南西井贫农王清云等控诉他对农民的压榨罪行。\n    玉王荣是武安南西井人。抗战初期任西井（南北西井还没分开）第一任农会主任，后来当过镇长、区干部。中间“妥协”两次（回家当老百姓）。据给他三叔当长工的王巨富说，他祖父叫王九阳，种六十亩地，有一条骡子、一个驴、两个牛，觅着一个长工，还喂着大群羊。民国十二、三年三股分家，王玉荣的二叔和三步（叫王同昌，三十五年被斗），都觅着长工，王玉荣父亲王秋子这一股，因为劳力多，自种自吃。听劳动英雄张家俊说：“后来他二叔吸料面把时光弄垮，有七亩地卖给王玉荣父亲。”民国十三、四年，王玉荣弟兄四人分家，每人分地七亩。（张家俊说的）南西井副村长郝贵田谈去年王玉荣分果实的情况说：“按他的成份，就该不着分，因为是个工属哩，也就分的不少。头一次三分，每分九千元，三九两万七。第二次每分一千五百元，也分了三分。村里最高的分才十分。”据贫农王功亮说：“王玉荣现有十来亩地（内有六亩好地，共合产量十石挂零，共三口人吃）共分五片，每片二、三家代耕。村上对他家和抗烈属一样忧待：种地、打柴、担水、碾米、驮炭等完全派差派工。”\n    谈到王玉荣当镇长的情况，政治主任胡廷选说：那时一般人已不敢赌博，可是只要他搭上股就能赌。出一场“宝”，他收五百元的“头钱”。“板面”（赌博的一种形式），他见十抽一。当时米价是五毛一斤，一场“宝”他就赚一千斤米。他在当镇长的过程中，和地主拉得很紧，地主给他送礼，请他的客。因为帐目不清，群众要反他的贪污，他装病回家当了老百姓。这是第一次“妥协”，后来又调到区上工作。\n    民国三十三年，他在老二区当区干部，不知因为吃的不好还是别的原因，他装病回来了。回来以后，常找医生胡泽志（地主）看“病”。他对胡泽志说：“干部问我的时候，就说我有病哩！”其实没病。县政府不摸底细，还给了他不知多少养病粮。他自己本来就有存粮，那时灾荒还没过去，都没粮食吃，他就乘机放起高利贷来了。据胡廷选说：这是全村唯一放帐的人，利钱多的是月利三十分，少的是月利十二分五厘。他放帐有两种形式：一种是放钱。由于农民到现在还怕他，不敢承认借过他的债，所以他的全部材料还没弄出来，据初步统计，光王存山、王大恒、王振清、郭玉庆、王定一五个债户（都是贫农），就使了他五千九百元，除了郭玉庆使的六百元，是月利十二分五以外，别的都是使一千元，每天给利钱一百元，合月利三十分。另一种是“买牌”。麦前秋前，青黄不接的时候，他放给农民麦子或小米。麦后秋后，使不到两个月，就加倍还。这叫“买牌”。贫农郭玉庆、高长富、王清云、王定国、王存岭、王魁有六人，使了他一百七十五斤米、麦、另有十五斤谷子。（部分材料）\n    那年发动群众，群众蹩不住劲，要求清算王玉荣的帐。那时，王玉荣和一个农会常委在一个互助组里，两个人很好。农会布置斗争王玉荣，这个农会常委给王玉荣透了气。王玉荣见势不妙，打进农会，拉了一部分群众，弄得群众、干部都不敢提意见了。他就破坏了农民这次对他的清算。结果，有的暗暗的还了他的本利，有的只还了本，没还利。王玉荣不服气，他还收集已被减过租息的地主们对干部的意见，企图打击干部，没有成功。据六区武委会副主任申桂林（北西井人）说：去年秋天他和六区区长刘德贵，到王玉荣家玩了玩，出来以后，闲谈王玉荣家里布置得不错。群众说：“人家放帐挣下钱啦！”他们也听说利钱不小，但没打听，当然也没处理。\n    据劳动英雄张家俊谈：王玉荣不仅放高利货，还在灾荒年贱买青苗地，为这曾经受到政府批评。事情是这样的：那年灾荒，王家穷户伙开了块大坟地，种上青苗；可是肚里饿的不行，王玉荣就乘机把这块青苗地贱价买下了（据说只花了三百元钱）。县政府觉得王玉荣是干部，办这事太苛薄人，叫他把青苗地的粮食包出来，也不知包出来了没有？\n    逃荒户郭银和也提起王玉荣灾荒那年，曾经贱买叔父郭起银家的二亩多地。因为过歉年，贫苦农民吃了农会的粮食（这是政府从山西运来的救济粮，由农会交给运粮户保管吃掉了的），没法全部归还，只好把地卖给了王玉荣。\n    王玉荣不仅放高利贷，剥削农民，破坏了农民对他的清算，而且帮助地主向农民报复。据政治主任胡廷选说，民国三十三年清债减租，南西井斗争了大地主胡启堂。（据曾任武安县农会主席的宋占林说，胡启堂曾一次退租二百七十石，是西井的最大地主。）胡启堂的三儿子，是王玉荣的干儿子。王玉荣回到村里，胡启堂对他说：“你在村里担任工作的时候，我没被害。你一走，又减租、又清债，把我斗垮了。王聚文提意见太多。”王玉荣听了，找到住村干部区救联会主席纪红，区干事王五相说：“王聚文不是好人。对地主仇恨对，可是他说老婆，不该叫群众拿钱。”王聚文是贫农，说了个寡妇，要花二十多块钱买衣服，他花不起，有十个村干部体谅他的困难，每人帮了他五块钱。这就是王玉荣所说王聚文叫群众拿钱娶老婆的真相。纪红不摸底细，上了王玉荣的当。结果把王聚文斗了一顿。会场是王玉荣亲自掌握的，不让村干部参加，给王聚文戴上了个“贪污”的帽子，扣了起来。后来才叫村干部放出来。\n    王玉荣二次“妥协”回家，办了这么些坏事情，等他调到武（安）东县工作以后，据张家俊说，他还又托地主胡运廷替他代放高利贷。那年政府派人来调查，发现地主胡运廷放大利，本钱是由王玉荣手里拿出来的。在南西井群众会上，县政府李复昌科长，曾经训了胡运廷一顿，说你们的朋友（指王玉荣）不顶个屁！当时政府只批评了王玉荣一下，没有撒他的职，还让他当干部，继续统治群众，老实农民不敢吭气。\n    据贫农王清云说，民国三十四年阴历正月，王玉荣在家买了他家的大粪（每担两元），叫王玉庆去挑，挑出三个小羊羔来，王玉庆告诉了他，他说：“你就说是十个羊羔子。”接着王玉荣在街上放出一股子气去，说王清云父亲王银成（外号老粗子）杀了十多个生产羊，报告了当时住在尖山村的县府承审处。正月十四日，把王银成扣起来，扣了十天。罚了一万二千块钱（当时五十块钱一只羊）。王银成正月二十四日回家，连吓加气，二十五日就得了病，二月初一日死了。王玉荣多担了十二担大粪，王清云去要，他不给钱。\n    据胡廷选说，三十五年春天，地主王世杰的房子斗出来了，从安泽回来的逃荒户王月友（新中农）要买，副村长郝贵田也要买，王玉荣老婆给王玉荣捎了个信，王玉荣（当时在龙雾村工作，离家十多里）就说他要买这个房子。这一来谁也不敢要了，结果王玉荣买下。钱是那里来的呢？据曾任武安县农会主席的宋占林（龙雾村人，现在在家养病）说，钱是王玉荣在龙雾村分果实得的。他说：三十五年春天运动的时候，王玉荣在龙雾工作，买了些桌柜等物，不知给钱没有。第二次批果实，王玉荣也定了两分（一分一万元）。在龙雾工作的另一区干部李敬南不同意，但是没有起什么作用，只是在农会上宣布分数的时候，没有宣布王玉荣的名字，结果他从村长任明兴那里拿走了两万块钱。以后村干部集体反省当中，开头村长不承认，后来大家一挤，他才说出来。"

    "content": "[This report]\n\n    The people of Hexi Village, Wu'an, Yearn for Democracy\n    Old Cadres Rule the Masses Long-Term\n    Land is Largely Leveled, but Farmers Have Not Completely Overturned [their situation] Politically and Economically.\n    [Our News] The large-scale mass movement in Hexi Village, Wu'an County, began as early as 1942. After the May 4th Directive, and through further replenishment, the land distribution, both in terms of quantity and quality, achieved a general average. However, the distribution of floating wealth was extremely unfair. The village cadres, basically a group promoted around the 1942 movement, have long used the power of \"workers\" to rule the masses, engaging in corruption, failing to account for expenses for a long time, and suppressing the masses from expressing opinions. The masses are very dissatisfied and urgently demand democracy.\n    Hexi Village is a small village of 115 households, but the land is highly concentrated. Before 1942, the four major landlords occupied more than 10 of the village's 14 *qing* of land. The political and economic rule of the major landlords such as Zhang Ruizhi, Zhang Wansheng, and Zhang Xilin extended to more than ten nearby villages. Apart from two rich peasant households and eight old middle peasant households, most were landless or land-poor peasants who relied on being long-term laborers, short-term workers, gathering fuel, peddling, brick-making, carpentry, and other means to make a living. During the \"July 7th\" Incident, the village was disrupted by the 53rd Army and retreating Kuomintang soldiers, and the landlords' property suffered some losses. Before 1942, the landlords sold a large amount of land to avoid burdens. In 1942, the double reduction struggle began. In 1943, the masses discovered the hidden land and grain payments concealed by the landlords. From then on, landless and land-poor peasants began to obtain some land (cleared and returned, bought at low prices, or acquired through mortgages). These people were mostly cadres and active participants in the struggle, as well as a small number of tenant farmers, debtors, and hired laborers. However, the feudal forces of the landlords were not defeated. During the famine in 1943, the major landlord Zhang Wansheng even went to nearby villages to lend grain at interest, but he did not lend to this village, saying, \"I would rather feed wolves than feed tigers,\" to sow discord between the peasants of this village and other villages, in order to continue to maintain his political and economic rule. In the spring of 1946, an anti-traitor liquidation was carried out. Farmers from more than ten villages, including Dajing and Nanbeicongjing, organized a joint struggle against the major landlords in this village. This time, the houses and land of major landlords such as Zhang Wansheng were confiscated, and Zhang Wansheng himself fled. This time, the attack on the four major feudal forces was relatively heavy. Another part of the poor and hired peasants in this village began to be allocated land.\n    After the May 4th Directive, through several replenishments, the land distribution in the village achieved a general average. However, cadres and some dependents of revolutionary soldiers occupied good land and whole plots of land (there is very little remote land in this village). Some cadres (especially dependents of revolutionary soldiers cadres) used various methods to transfer their bad and fragmented land to the households being struggled against, and after they had their fill, it was the revolutionary soldiers' families' turn. The land of some individual poor and hired peasants was still not enough, both in terms of quantity and quality.\n    Generally speaking, the situation of the \"turning over\" since the land reform has the following points: (1) Very little floating wealth was distributed, and there are eight households that are currently short of clothing, food, and live in dilapidated houses. Among them, there are two households who, it is said, \"like to say destructive things\" and were excluded from the peasants' association, and did not receive any floating wealth. Three households are single men. The cadres said that it was useless for him to have too many things, such as oil mill worker Jia Zhengfang, who wanted a box. The cadre said: \"Are you still going to marry a wife? What do you need good furniture for?\" As a result, he was given a roll of cloth, which turned out to be a few children's clothes. The hired laborer Bei Fang wore all his clothes on his body to get through the winter, and did not have a single piece left at home. The hired laborer Lai Shan lives in a leaky house. One household had just returned from planting on mountain land in Zuoquan County, and seven people slept on a small *kang* together, with three broken quilts, and the clothes worn by the children were ragged like little beggars. The cadre said he was a \"bottomless pit,\" and said, \"You were away when we were suffering in the famine years, and you came back when we were distributing the fruits of the struggle, what a good deal!\" The other two households were said to be old and weak, \"getting old and about to die!\" So they were not given anything. (2) Those who have turned over the highest are cadres and some dependents of revolutionary soldiers, among whom the highest are cadres who are also dependents of revolutionary soldiers, such as peasants' association committee member Zhang Wenke (one of the \"big cadres\" in the eyes of the masses, who was a poor peasant two years ago). He selected mostly medium or above good land, and in large plots. Floating wealth, tables, chairs, boxes, cabinets, etc., were mostly selected in pairs, because he has two sons, saying that it would be easy to divide the family in the future. When he married his wife last year, the cadre said: \"They are dependents of revolutionary soldiers, and the table should be decorated during the happy event.\" He was told to go to the fruit storehouse to pick the best furniture, red lacquer tables and chairs, dressing mirrors, etc. Apart from good houses and good land, the other five major cadres all have good furniture and good bedding at home. The masses said: \"In addition to what they use, they also have decorations.\" The masses reflected: \"The higher-ups told us to fill in the *ge dao* [gullies, referring to inequalities], and our village is adding *ge ge* [meaning adding even more]. The masses are extremely dissatisfied with the cadres' excessive possession of the fruits of the struggle. Although the general dependents of revolutionary soldiers get more than the general masses, they are worse off than cadres who are also dependents of revolutionary soldiers. For example, poor peasant and revolutionary soldier dependent Lao Enzi, although her score for the fruits of struggle is the highest in the village, she is also extremely dissatisfied. She said: \"The score is not small, but it is an empty name. No one wants to exchange Zhang Wenke's things with ten points for my thirty points, they lock the door and choose the good things first, and then take out what is left for us to choose, and they also say it's preferential treatment! Anyway, there is no one inside (referring to not being a cadre) to help.\" (3) According to preliminary understanding, more than 70% of the peasants in the village have now reached the living standards of middle and lower-middle peasants. Out of 115 households in the village, excluding 29 households being struggled against, one newly discovered rich peasant, and eight poor and hired peasants who have turned over very poorly, the remaining 77 households have now reached the level of middle and lower-middle peasants. Among them, the 16 cadres have all turned over to a higher level. The remaining 61 households of the masses (including dependents of revolutionary soldiers), seven households are old middle peasants, 26 households have gradually risen since the double reduction, and 28 households have greatly turned over since the land reform. Because these households have not turned over for long and their foundation is empty, although they are not very short of food and clothing, their houses, farm tools, livestock, etc. are not complete.\n    The main characteristic of the village cadres is that they are old cadres who have been working since the opening up of work in 1942 and have been ruling for a long time. Although some new ones were added after the May 4th Directive, basically it is only one group, and the changes are only individual replacements. Basically, a few key figures are still in charge. The new cadres mostly listen to the old cadres, and a few key cadres rule other new cadres and small cadres. The anti-despotism director Zhang Xiao is a \"founding hero\" and is still the \"big cadre\" and \"pillar\" of the village. Although the old cadres Zhang Jucen and Zhang Chengxin have stopped working, their sons have \"inherited\" and become big cadres. The masses said that their family \"produces cadres for generations.\" Because the village branch is under their rule, it has no leading role at all. Until the recent public party [rectification] movement, most of the masses still did not understand what the branch and the Communist Party members were.\n    The five major cadres have been ruling in the village for a long time, acting arbitrarily and disregarding the masses. The fruits of their struggle have almost all \"filled their bellies.\" The anti-despotism director Zhang Xiao now has the best vegetable garden in the village and lives in a good courtyard belonging to Zhang Wansheng, one of the four major landlords. The masses said: \"Just dismantling a brick from the gate tower of his house is worth all our family property.\" He feeds two head of livestock and hired a long-term worker for seven months last year. The public security officer Qi Gui, a family of three, now lives in seventeen good rooms. Relying on being a public security officer, he pays attention to \"political issues,\" and at every turn says \"sabotage,\" arbitrarily detaining people, excluding them from the peasants' association. In the famine years, he embezzled and overused grain and funds from black land, and when the masses fled the famine, sold their children, and starved to death, he used the embezzled grain and funds to buy land and houses. When the masses talk about it, they are more angry than they are about the current situation, and they want to settle this account of embezzlement. The peasants' association committee member Zhang Wenke says one thing and no one dares say another in the village. If the peasants' association makes a decision, he can overturn it alone. Because he did not pick a good house, he once obstructed the division of the houses in the village several times, and it is still shelved to this day. Because he himself is a revolutionary soldier and a cadre, he wanted livestock, so he decided that revolutionary soldiers should buy livestock without taking up the share of the fruits of struggle. However, he wanted a good animal until last summer and had not paid for it, while poor and hired peasants who bought half a donkey almost took up the share of the fruits of struggle. The village chief Zhang Dengshan bought half of the famous glass courtyard in the village. Zhang Yanggen, the deputy director of the armed forces committee, cursed and beat people in the village. These figures formed an anti-people clique very early on, riding on the heads of the masses. One poor peasant who was excluded from the peasants' association said: \"We overthrew the old rich man and lifted the big stone slab, but replaced it with this stone roller.\"\n    Speaking of why they can rule for so long, the masses said: \"They have a strong foundation, the workers and the district are all in cahoots with them!\" Some said: \"When the workers come to the village, they always only look for a few cadres, and they discuss it and do everything, who will ask us poor old people?\" In the past, the district cadres and workers have always supported the cadres, and when they came to the village to work, they just looked for a few big cadres to arrange things and that was it, and they never asked the poor and hired peasants. Some even took the lead in corruption and were selfish. For example, the district cadre Hao Fukui married a woman from the family of the Qingyansi landlord Wang Xinde, and settled in Hexi, encroaching on six *mu* of good land from the masses; Guo Peijun encroached on a lot of the fruits of struggle after leading the joint struggle. It is said that he once used two heads of livestock to transport it back to his home in Guantaochuan.\n    Historically, the masses have also risen several times to demand democracy, but they were quickly suppressed. Last spring, when washing faces and wiping black [a metaphor for cleaning up cadres but ending up smearing them instead], after repeated mobilization by the district cadre, a guarantee committee was established to guarantee that the cadres would not retaliate. However, when a poor peasant made more than ten suggestions, the district cadre Hao Fukui said: \"Washing your face and wiping it black, you're scalding your skin! This is to give advice to the cadres, not to the landlords.\" After that, this group of people who made suggestions looked at each other and dared not say anything anymore. Not long after that, the poor peasant who made the most suggestions was detained by the cadres on the grounds of \"liking to say destructive things,\" and later excluded from the peasants' association. At that time, the opinions raised by the masses were never resolved, and the cadres' problems were not changed at all. Due to these historical experiences, the masses find it difficult to trust us. After repeated support, they still have not fully spoken their true feelings.\n    Currently, the masses have three major common and urgent demands: First, to liquidate the accounts of the several struggles, in addition to the unfair distribution, the silver dollars, gold and silver jewelry, and auction proceeds from the previous struggles were said to be distributed to the masses, but they were never actually received. When asked, they said they were all placed in the cooperative. No one in the masses knows the bottom line. The flower accounts from several struggles have never been posted. The masses demand liquidation and withdrawal. Second, to liquidate the accounts of the grain and funds adjusted during the famine years, there are also great private abuses by the cadres in the middle of this, and the distribution and sale of grain is unfair. According to preliminary investigation, in that year, apart from those who fled the famine and whose whereabouts are unknown and those who sold their children, eight people in the village starved to death. The masses who have been oppressed say: \"The cadres had grain to eat and bought land, but we all ended up with our families scattered, why didn't we see any cadres fleeing the famine, selling their children, or starving to death? We can't be truly satisfied if this account is not settled.\" Third, to demand democratic governance and \"the right to speak.\" The masses reflected that \"whoever makes a suggestion will cause trouble, if you say the wrong word, people will 'trace the root,' if they trace it to the cadres, nothing will happen, but if they trace it to us, it will be slander and sabotage, either detention or sealing the door, or exclusion from the peasants' association.\" The main reason why the two people in this village were excluded from the peasants' association was because they made too many suggestions to the cadres. They urgently demand the abolition of these \"laws\" made by the cadres themselves and the removal of this new stone slab so that they can stand up and take charge themselves.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武安河西村群众渴望民主  老干部长期统治群众  土地大体填平，农民在政治上经济上并未彻底翻身。\n\n1948-02-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    武安河西村群众渴望民主\n    老干部长期统治群众\n    土地大体填平，农民在政治上经济上并未彻底翻身。\n    【本报消息】武安河西村的较大规模群众运动是从四二年就开始了的，五四指示后，又经过填补，土地分配无论从数量上与质量上看，都做到大体平均。但浮财分配上极不公平。本村干部基本上是在四二年运动前后提拔起来的一个集团，长期利用“工作员”的势力统治群众，贪污，长期不算帐，压制群众不许提意见。群众十分不满，迫切要求民主。\n    河西村是一百一十五户的小村，但土地十分集中，四二年前全村十四顷地，四大地主即占有十顷以上。张瑞芝、张万生、张锡林等大地主的政治经济统治，达附近十余村。除两户富农八户老中农外，其他大都是无地少地的农民，多依靠当长工、打短工、拾砍、贩卖、烧砖、木匠等糊口。“七七”事变时，本村经过五十三军及国民党溃兵扰乱，地主财产受到些损失，四二年以前，地主为逃避负担，即大量卖地，四二年开始了双减斗争，四三年群众查出地主隐瞒的黑地的负担粮款，从此无地少地农民开始获得一部分土地（清算抽回、贱价买的、当入的），这些人多是干部和斗争积极分子、及一少部分佃户、债户、雇工等。但地主的封建势力未打垮，四三年闹灾荒时，大地主张万生还到附近村去放粮帐，但不放给本村。说“宁可喂狼，不可喂虎”，挑拨本村与外村农民的团结，借以继续维持其政治经济统治。四六年春进行反奸清算，大井、南北丛井等十余村的农民，组织了对本村大地主的联合斗争，这一次把张万生等大地主的房子土地都没收了，张万生本人逃跑，这一次对四大封建势力的打击比较重。本村的另一部分贫雇，才开始分到土地。\n    五四指示后，经过数次填补，本村土地分配，做到了大体平均，但干部和一部分抗属占有好地和整块地（本村远地很少），一部分干部（特别是抗属干部）用各种办法把自己的赖地碎地都倒换给被斗户种，自己吃饱了，再轮到抗属。有个别贫雇农的土地仍未满足，无论从数量上质量上说都不够。\n    总起来看，土改以来的翻身情况有以下几点：（一）果实浮财分得很少，当下缺衣少食住破房的有八户。其中有两户，据说是“好说破坏话”被卡出农会的，果实浮财一份也没分。有三户是光棍汉，干部说他一个人分东西多了没用，如油坊工人贾正方，想要个箱子，干部说：“你还娶媳妇子？要好家具干啥？”结果给了个布卷子，打开看是几件小孩衣服。雇工北方把所有衣服全部都穿在身上过冬，家中一件也不剩。雇工来山住着漏房。一户是刚从左权县种山地回来，七口人共睡一个小炕，三个破被子，几个孩子穿的衣服破烂象小叫化子，干部说他是“填不满的坑”。说他“灾荒年受苦时你在外，分果实时你回来了，怪便宜！”另外两户是说他们是老弱，“年岁大了，快死了！”所以也没给分。（二）翻身较高的是干部与一部分抗属，其中最高的是干部兼抗属，如农会委员张文科（群众眼中的大干部之一，两年前还是贫农。）他挑选的多是中等以上的好地，且是大块的。浮财桌椅箱柜等多是选的成双成对的，因他有两个儿子，说将来分家好分。去年娶媳妇时，干部说：“人家是抗属，过喜事桌上应该摆饰摆饰。”叫他到果实屋里挑选最好的家具，红漆桌椅、穿衣镜等。其他五大干部除好房好地外，家中都是好家具好铺盖，群众说：“人家除了用的还有摆饰的。”群众反映：“上边叫填圪道，俺村是添圪圪。”群众对干部的多占果实极为不满。一般的抗属比一般群众虽多得，但比干部兼抗属的则差一些，如贫农抗属老恩子，她的果实分数虽属全村第一，但她也有极大不满，她说：“分数倒不少，是个空名，三十分换人家文科十几分的东西人家也不换，人家关着门把好的选完了，剩下的才拿出来叫咱挑，还说是优待哩！反正里边没人（指不是干部）啥也不顶。”（三）据初步了解全村百分之七十以上的农民，现在都达到中农及下中农的生活水平。全村一百一十五户，除二十九户斗争对象，一户新查出的富农、及八户翻身很差的贫雇外，下余七十七户眼前都达到中农及下中农的生活，其中十六户干部翻身都较高。其余六十一户群众（抗属在内），有七户是老中农，二十六户是双减以来逐渐上升的，二十八户是土改以来才大翻身的，这些户因翻身不久，底子空，衣食虽不很缺，但房屋农具牲口等都不齐全。\n    村干部的主要特点是从四二年开辟工作以来的老干部，长期统治。五四指示后虽曾增加了些新的，但基本上只一茬，变动只是个别的抽换，基本上仍是几个主要人物当家，新干部遇事多听老干部，几个主要干部统治其他新干部小干部。抗勤主任张效是“开国元勋”，现在还是全村的“大干部”、“台柱子”。老干部张巨贞、张成新虽不干了，他们的儿子又“世袭”成了大干部，群众说人家“辈辈出干部”。村支部因在他们的统治之下，毫无领导作用。直到这次公开党时，群众多数还不明白支部、共产党员是怎么会事。\n    五大干部在村长久统治，独断专横，目无群众，果实差不多也都“吃胀了肚皮”。抗勤主任张效，现在有着全村最好的菜园，住着四大财主之一张万生的一所好院，群众说：“只拆人家一个门楼上的砖，也顶咱这全部家当”。他喂着两头牲口，去年还雇了七个月的长工。公安员启贵，三口人现住着十七间好房，仗着是公安员，注意“政治问题”，动不动就说“破坏”，随便扣压人卡出农会，灾荒年他贪污和多用了黑地粮款，群众逃荒，卖孩子、饿死人，他却以贪污粮款置地，买房，群众说起来比对眼下的事还气恨，要算这笔贪污帐。农会委员张文科，在村说一不二，农会群众作出决定，他一个人可以推翻。他没有挑到好房子，曾从中阻拦、村中房子几次都没分成，到现在还在搁着。因他自己是抗属兼干部，想要牲口，就决定抗属买牲口不占果实分。但他要下一个好牲口直到去夏还没出钱，贫雇则买半个驴就把果实分占个差不多了。村长张登山买下了半串全村出名的玻璃院。武委会副主任张羊根在村开口骂人，动手打人。这几个人物，很早就形成了一个反人民的小集团，骑在群众头上。被卡出农会的一个贫农说：“打垮老财掀了大石板，又换上了这个石砘子”。\n    谈到他们为什么能统治这样久，群众说：“人家根底硬，工作员和区上都和人家是一气！”有的说：“工作员到村，总是只找几个干部，人家一商量，啥事都办了，谁还来问问咱穷老百姓？”过去区干部工作员一直是给干部撑腰的，到村工作也只是找一找几个大干部布置一番就算完事，从没有去问问贫雇。有些更领头贪污，自私。如区干郝富魁，娶了青烟寺地主王新德家女人，在河西按了家，侵占了群众六亩好地；郭培均在领导联合斗争后，侵占很多果实，据说曾用两条牲口，运回馆陶川他自己家。\n    历史上群众也曾几次起来要求过民主，但很快被压下去了。去春洗脸擦黑时，经区干再三动员，又成立了保证委员会，保证干部不报复，但当一个贫农提意见提到了十条以上时，区干郝富魁就说：“洗脸擦黑哩，你这就把皮也烫了！这是给干部提意见，又不是给地主提意见”。以后这伙提意见的你望我我望你，再也不敢说什么了。此后不久，这个提意见最多的贫农，就被干部以“好说破坏话”的罪名扣起来，后又卡出了农会。那时群众提的意见一直也没有解决，干部的毛病一点也未改了。群众由于这些历史经验，很难相信我们，经过一再撑腰，现在仍未全部说出真心话。\n    目前群众有三大共同的迫切要求：一、是清算几次的斗争果实帐，除分配的不公外，历次斗争中的银元、金银首饰以及拍卖的款项，说是分给群众，实际都没拿到，问起来说都放在合作社里了，群众谁也不摸底，几次斗争的花帐也没贴过，群众要求清算、退出。二、是清算灾荒年黑地粮、款调济所帐，这中间干部也有很大私弊，分粮卖粮都有不公。据初步调查，本村群众那年除逃荒出外没下落的和卖孩子的以外，光饿死的就有八个。受过制的群众说：“人家干部有粮食吃还买地，咱都弄的一家人五零四散，怎没见那个干部逃荒、卖孩子、饿死人？这笔帐不算真不能甘心。”三、是要求民主当家，“有说话权。”群众反映说：“谁提意见就要惹祸，说错一句话人家就要‘追根’，追到干部身上没事，追到咱身上就是造谣破坏，不是扣押就是封门，或卡出农会。”这村两个被卡出农会的，主要都是因为对干部多提了意见。他们迫切要求取消这些干部自定的“法律”，掀去这块新石板自己起来当家。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: TASS, New York: Binson, chairman of the \"Wallace for President National Committee,\" recently told the press that Wallace's presidential campaign movement is expanding and strengthening. The committee has established branches in twelve states, and branches in another fourteen states are about to be established. Binson said: The American people want to cast their votes for Wallace's program of peace and prosperity. He believes that the committee's branches will be established in all forty-eight states. In addition, Blisson, chairman of the Independent Progressive Party of California, told the press that the party's campaign to collect 500,000 signatures to demand that Wallace be placed on the ballot has collected 335,000 signatures. The newly established People's Progressive Party of Florida also announced its support for Wallace. At the same time, the CIO Executive Board is facing a crisis of division after deciding not to support a third party. Brothman, the CIO's chief lawyer, has resigned in anger. It is reported that other left-wing union leaders will follow Brothman, which will result in a union withdrawing from the CIO. The CIO-affiliated Agricultural Machinery Workers Union has also announced its support for Wallace. Under the growing strength of democratic forces, the Truman administration has adopted shameless repressive measures. The US police are now preparing a \"blacklist\" of Wallace supporters. Binson has protested to Truman about this, denouncing it as no different from Hitler's secret police system.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: New York: The movement to support Wallace's presidential campaign \"has reached a larger scale\" (TASS). In New York State, the 500 delegates to the statewide conference of the American Progressive Citizens Association unanimously urged the mobilization of all democratic forces to implement the greatest cooperation to elect Wallace. The delegates also condemned the reactionary programs of the Democratic and Republican parties, which are both \"forcing the United States into depression and new wars.\" Ohio has also begun a mass movement to support Wallace's campaign. A mass meeting was held in Columbus recently. According to a report by renowned Soviet journalist Zhukov on the current American people's movement: \"A broad united front of American democratic forces is gradually forming in the struggle against reactionary forces.\" He pointed out: \"The American Progressive Citizens Association has united a large number of progressive intellectuals, writers, scientists, artists, and supporters of Roosevelt's New Deal. They support Wallace's campaign. They know that the American reactionaries control the state apparatus and can still control most of the votes, but the American progressive forces are still fighting bravely against the enemy because they understand that they can only be tempered and gain experience in fierce struggle, which will be very useful in the future.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: TASS, New York: Binson, chairman of the \"Wallace for President National Committee,\" issued a statement on the 4th stating that the Eastern Department of the National Farmers Union has endorsed Wallace as a candidate.

The Standing Committee of the German People's Congress submitted a protest to the western zone authorities and the Allied Control Council on the 7th, strongly condemning this ban as \"violating the Potsdam Agreement which guarantees the German people basic democratic rights.\" The protest demanded the immediate cancellation of this illegal ban. Reimann, chairman of the Communist Party in the British occupation zone, pointed out at a mass meeting of 10,000 people in Düsseldorf that the prohibition of the People's Congress in the Anglo-American joint occupation zone was due to the enemies of German unity fearing the strength of the people's power. Reimann said with confidence: \"But progressive forces will sweep away all obstacles.\" Grotewohl (formerly misreported as Grotewohl), one of the leaders of the Socialist Unity Party, also condemned Western imperialism for tearing up the Potsdam Agreement.

    "content": "[Our Newspaper's Report] The People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi has once again recovered Yuncheng and Jiexian. After our army first liberated Yuncheng on the night of December 27th, Chiang Kai-shek's 1st Division, 36th Division, and 3rd Division crossed the river from Lingbao on January 6th, concentrated their forces, and moved with trepidation. They traveled a hundred miles in six days, and on January 11th, they sneaked into Yuncheng. Barely catching their breath, they boasted of \"recovering Southern Shanxi,\" leaving the 30th Division under Lu Chongyi to defend this isolated city, and sending Zhang Juwen, Chief of Staff of the 27th Brigade (under the 30th Division), concurrently as the local \"Commissioner.\" They hastily built fortifications and organized \"local teams,\" dreaming of a long-term presence. Although Yuncheng was a newly liberated area, the democratic government quickly dismantled the puppet regime, opened granaries to relieve the poor, arranged employment for unemployed workers, and resolutely protected industry and commerce, winning the support of the broad masses of people, which rapidly consolidated the work in the area. Therefore, when Chiang Kai-shek's troops sneaked into Yuncheng for the second time, the mass-based guerrilla warfare quickly developed, actively preparing for the complete annihilation of the enemy in the area, besieging and harassing them, killing and wounding some of the enemy, preventing them from gaining a foothold. On the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek's troops were short of manpower, their morale was low, and they were constantly threatened by the fate of having over ten thousand annihilated in the first defeat. In addition, they were repeatedly attacked by our guerrilla forces, realizing that they were like turtles in a jar, and hastily sought to escape the fate of being completely annihilated, fleeing in panic on February 7th. Our besieging troops immediately moved into Yuncheng. Jiexian, south of Yuncheng, was also liberated at the same time.\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 13th] The section of the Tongpu Railway south of Lingshi and north of Linfen is still controlled by the People's Liberation Army, and Linfen remains completely isolated. After Yan Xishan's 66th Division moved south along the Tongpu Railway from Central Shanxi to reinforce Linfen in early January, our local armed forces and militiamen became more active under the city of Linfen. On January 10th, our local armed forces annihilated a total of 140 Yan Xishan's police and shock troops in Wucun, 30 miles north of Linfen. The 66th Division, which had sneaked into Linfen, was terrified and lived in fear every day.\n    [Taiyue News] Guerrilla teams in Jiexiu and Lingshi have been repeatedly victorious in ambushes. On January 29th, over 30 men from the 218th Regiment of Yan Xishan's troops in Shangliang, Jiexiu, went to Liukou Village in the First District to plunder, and were ambushed by Zhang Ximan's combat team and the militiamen of Shangliang Village, killing five Yan Xishan troops, including company and platoon leaders, and wounding eleven. On January 26th, two companies of the 217th Regiment of Yan Xishan's troops, newly stationed in Baohe and Yuan, attacked Jiajiabao and fell into an ambush by the Jiajiabao militiamen, who killed and wounded five Yan Xishan troops. On the 2nd of this month, the local troops in Jiexiu attacked Yan Xishan's puppet troops in Dingsong Village, east of Song, annihilating seventeen enemy soldiers, including a squad leader. The Lingshi Brigade also won two victories on January 19th. On that day, more than 20 men from the 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion of the 45th Division of Yan Xishan's troops in Lingshi City went to Kongjialing to loot. They were ambushed by our guerrilla brigade and the militiamen of Mengjialing, killing and wounding seven Yan Xishan troops, capturing six alive, and seizing two rifles. On the same day, another company of the guerrilla brigade ambushed the coal mine in Shicungou, First District. A battalion of Yan Xishan's troops came to pull coal with three animals, and were ambushed again, killing two enemy soldiers, wounding one, and capturing three animals and two rifles.\n    [Taihang News] The local troops of Huojia, Wuzhi, and Huixian in the Fifth Military Sub-district, penetrated deep behind enemy lines and annihilated over 80 enemy soldiers in four battles, suffering no casualties. On the night of January 30th, our Huojia and Wuzhi troops traveled over 90 miles round trip to raid the Erpuying and Jiaying strongholds, which had been occupied by the enemy for a long time, annihilating parts of the township government and the puppet self-defense corps. In total, 19 enemy soldiers and over 10 local tyrants were captured, one enemy soldier was killed, and one light machine gun, 29 rifles, over 9,100 rounds of ammunition, eight rifle grenades, and two telephones were seized. We suffered no casualties. The Huojia First District Work Team and the Public Security Team, which coordinated with this raid, also defeated the puppet self-defense corps in Fanzhuang (half a mile west of Erpuying), capturing seven puppet self-defense corps members alive, capturing 18 local tyrants, and seizing one rifle. On January 31st, our Huixian Brigade, in order to thwart the enemy's grain grabbing during the New Year, went deep into Zhao Village, east of Huixian City, to set up an ambush. When over 100 men from the 5th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Huixian Security Forces advanced towards Zhao Village, the county brigade suddenly pounced on the enemy's vanguard, completely annihilating the 3rd Detachment of the 15th Company in ten minutes, without any casualties. Subsequently, on the 2nd of this month, the Huixian Brigade launched an attack on the Chiang Kai-shek troops along the Xinxiang-Pinghan railway, ambushing the Chiang Kai-shek troops at the Xiaohuang stronghold. In total, in the above four battles, over 70 enemy soldiers were captured, and 16 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and one machine gun, 46 rifles, and 9,500 rounds of ammunition were seized. We suffered no casualties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪害怕全部被歼慌忙溜走  运城解县再度光复  介休获嘉等地营兵歼匪百余\n\n1948-02-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    蒋匪害怕全部被歼慌忙溜走\n    运城解县再度光复\n    介休获嘉等地营兵歼匪百余\n    【本报消息】晋南人民解放军又收复了运城、解县。我军于十二月二十七日夜第一次光复运城以后，蒋匪第一师、第卅六师、第三师于一月六号自灵宝渡河，集中行动，提心吊胆，六天走了一百多里，一月十一号窜进运城。刚刚喘过一口气，就吹牛“收复晋南”，留卅师鲁崇义部困守这座孤城，派二十七旅（三十师属）参谋长张居温兼当地“专员”，慌忙修筑工事，组织“地方团队”，梦想长期驻扎。运城虽是我新解放区，但由于民主政府迅速摧垮伪政权，开仓济贫，安插失业工人，坚决保护工商业，获得广大人民的拥护和支持，使该地区工作迅速走向巩固。故当蒋匪二次窜进运城以后，当地群众性的游击战争就很快开展起来，积极为全部歼灭该地敌人作准备，围困袭扰，杀伤了一部分敌人，使敌人没法站稳脚根。另一方面，蒋匪兵力不足，士气低落，时时为第一次被歼万余的命运所威胁，加以屡遭我游击部队打击，发现自己已如鳖入瓮，急谋逃脱全部被歼命运，就在二月七号慌忙溜走。我围困部队当即进驻运城。运城南边的解县也同时光复。\n    【新华社晋绥十三日电】同蒲路灵石以南，临汾以北的一段铁路，刻仍为解放军控制，临汾依然完全孤立。一月上旬，阎匪派六十六师由晋中沿同蒲路南下增援临汾后，我地方武装及民兵更积极在临汾城下活动。一月十日我地武即在临汾以北三十里的吴村歼灭阎匪保警队、突击队共一百四十余人。窜入临汾的六十六师惊恐万状，度日如年。\n    【太岳消息】介休灵石游击队打埋伏接连得胜。一月二十九日，介休上梁阎匪二一八团三十多人，到一区溜口村抢掠，遭张锡满战斗队和上梁村民兵伏击，打死阎匪连排长以下五名，打伤十一名。一月二十六日，新驻保和沅阎匪二一七团两个连，向我焦家堡进攻，又中了焦家堡民兵伏击，打死打伤阎匪五名。本月二日，介休营兵进击东宋丁村阎伪，歼敌分队长以下十七名。灵石大队在一月十九日，也打了两个胜仗。那天，灵石城阎匪四十五师一团一营二连二十多人到孔家岭抢东西。遭我游击大队与孟家岭民兵伏击，打死打伤阎匪七人，活捉六名，得步枪两支。同日游击大队另一个连埋伏在一区石村沟煤窑上，阎匪一个营带着三个牲口来拉煤，又中埋伏，打死匪两名，打伤一名，得牲口三头，步枪两支。\n    【太行消息】五分区获嘉、武陟、辉县营兵，长途深入敌后，四仗歼敌八十余名，我毫无伤亡。一月三十日夜，我获嘉、武陟营往返九十余里，奔袭敌长期盘踞之二铺营及嘉应据点，歼敌乡公所及伪自卫团一部。两处共俘敌十九名，奸霸十余名，毙敌一人，缴获轻机枪一挺，步枪二十九支，子弹九千一百多发，枪溜弹八个，电话机两部。我无伤亡，配合此次奔袭战的获嘉一区武工队和公安队，亦将范庄（二铺营西半里）伪自卫团打垮，生俘伪自卫团员七名，捉回奸霸十八名，缴步枪一支。一月三十一日，我辉县大队为粉碎敌年关抢粮，即深入辉县城东赵庄设伏，当蒋伪辉县保安五大队百余人向赵庄进犯时，县大队突然向敌先头部队猛扑，十分钟即全歼该部十五中队三分队，我毫无伤亡。此后，本月二日辉县大队又向蒋匪新乡平汉沿线出击；伏击小黄据点蒋匪。总计上述四仗，俘敌七十余名，毙伤敌十六名。缴获机枪一挺，步枪四十六支，子弹九千五百发。我无伤亡。"

When they set off to return north, the various units of the People's Liberation Army held warm farewell ceremonies and congratulated the participating heroes for their contributions. At a farewell meeting for the Jiyuan participation team by a certain unit, a certain general, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers, expressed his gratitude, pointing out that they had fought in the Central Plains, rescued the wounded, transported supplies, and made great contributions. At the same time, in their busy schedule, they also mobilized the masses to help the people of Henan to stand up. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army bid farewell to the Qinshui and Gaoping participation teams, and more than 300 heroes were gloriously awarded. Amidst cheers and applause, many silk banners were presented to the participation teams by representatives of the troops, one of which read \"The glory of Taiyue shines on the Central Plains.\" Each hero received the most glorious award from the troops, a combat merit certificate. It is reported that they crossed the Yellow River north before the Lunar New Year and arrived safely in their hometowns.\n    \nXinhua News Agency, Su-Lu-Yu-Wan Front, 15th: The military support transportation teams composed of liberated peasants from thirteen counties in Central Shandong, after successfully completing their tasks, gloriously returned to their hometowns from the Su-Lu-Yu-Wan front before the Spring Festival. Before their departure, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army held a grand farewell meeting. The People's Liberation Army highly praised the people's contribution to supporting the front and awarded twenty-five red flags with the inscription \"Glorious Return to Hometown\" and various prizes. The laborers thanked the People's Liberation Army for helping them to completely stand up. They agreed that after returning home, they would take the lead in production, land reform, and military support work. Over the past year, the transportation team had traveled thousands of miles with the People's Liberation Army, from the Yi-Lu Mountains to the Central Plains, and had participated in dozens of major and minor battles such as Mengshan, Yi-Lu Mountains area, Tai'an, and Shatuji, creating countless heroic deeds. In March of last year, they participated in the Mengshan blocking battle for the first time, and the Yishui East stretcher team, famous throughout Shandong for its 300-li rapid transfer, emerged during the rescue. During the Menglianggu campaign in April, the \"Qin Zhongrong Model Squad,\" which cared for the wounded as if they were their own limbs, emerged. After the counter-offensive began in July, the \"Wang Peiheng Love-the-People Model Platoon\" emerged in helping poor brothers in the new areas to stand up. Wang Peiheng, the head of the Love-the-People Model Platoon and a farmhand from Huaian (newly established county east of Linqu), repaired twenty houses for the people and mended twenty-three pairs of shoes for his platoon comrades. In the past year, not a single person in the platoon violated the discipline of the masses, and fourteen communist party members were developed, earning the platoon commendation from the leaders, and a \"Wang Peiheng movement\" was launched. In the swampy areas and harsh climates of southwestern Shandong, the laborers overcame numerous difficulties and completed the task of transferring the wounded and transporting ammunition. Cheng Xueling, a farmhand from Yishui East, rescued the wounded seven times in one night during the Heze-Cao County campaign. Song Yongji, a farmer from Yiyuan (newly established county north of Yishui), bravely rushed to the front line in every battle. During the Shatuji campaign, he single-handedly captured one small cannon, one mortar tube, and two rifles.

    "content": "[News from Our Newspaper] The Border Region Government plans to distribute 10 million jin of millet this year, mainly to provide relief for the spring famine and support spring plowing. A small portion will be reserved for emergency relief in the second half of the year. Based on the current disaster situation and relief conditions in various regions, it has been decided to allocate 7.3 million jin of budgeted relief grain from the Border Region as follows: 3 million jin to Taihang, 2 million jin to Jinnan, 1.6 million jin to Ji-Lu-Yu, and 700,000 jin to Taiyue. This relief grain will be primarily used for work relief programs, such as constructing and repairing railways, highways, roads, and bridges; preventing and controlling floods; developing water conservancy projects (e.g., building dikes, dredging rivers, opening canals, and digging wells); and planting trees. The labor of disaster-stricken people will be utilized to develop construction projects. In disaster areas with conditions suitable for work relief, disaster victims must be organized to participate in work relief programs, with the poorest peasants who have been most severely affected being the main beneficiaries. Wages should be slightly higher than the local average for short-term labor. The construction period should not interfere with the famine relief season or affect land reform.\n    In disaster areas lacking the conditions for implementing work relief, efforts will be made to organize the masses for production and self-help, creating various production conditions for disaster victims and transforming the relief grain into capital for production and self-help, thus overcoming the famine through production to avoid simply consuming the grain. To ensure the smooth completion of the task, disaster areas implementing work relief should have relevant departments appoint dedicated personnel to form work relief committees to uniformly lead construction and relief efforts. In disaster areas where production and self-help are the primary focus, the construction department will be responsible for carrying out production and famine relief work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府发救济米一千万斤  以工代赈救济春荒\n\n1948-02-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    边府发救济米一千万斤\n    以工代赈救济春荒\n    【本报消息】边区政府本年预定发放救济粮一千万斤小米，主要用于救济春荒、支持春耕，小部暂保留作下半年紧急救济使用。根据当前各地灾情及救灾条件，决定先将边区预算救济粮七百卅万斤，分配给太行三百万斤，冀南二百万斤，冀鲁豫一百六十万斤，太岳七十万斤。此项救济粮食主要用于以工代赈，如兴修补修铁路、公路、大路、桥梁，防治水患，兴修水利（如修堤、疏河、开渠、凿井），及播种造林等。利用灾民劳力，兴办建设事业。凡有以工代赈条件的灾区，必须组织灾民进行以工代赈，以被灾最重的贫苦农民为主要对象，工资要稍高于当地一般短工工资。施工时间，以不误渡荒季节，又不影响土地改革为原则。\n    缺乏施行以工代赈条件的灾区，则用于组织群众生产自救，为灾民创造各种生产条件，把救济粮作成生产自救资本，从生产中渡过灾荒，以免吃光了事。为保证任务的顺利完成，以工代赈的灾区应由有关部门指派专人组成工赈委员会，统一领导施工及救济事宜。以生产自救为主要的灾区，则由建设部门负责，进行生产渡荒工作。"

Fu Yonghua, a machine gunner who was liberated in the Dayanghu battle, said at the meeting, \"I came early and saw the People's Liberation Army becoming stronger day by day.\" He recounted the Dayanghu battle, the Henan-North campaign, the Longhai campaign, the annihilation of nine and a half enemy brigades in southwestern Shandong after crossing the river, and the victorious arrival at the Dabie Mountains after a 1,000-mile southern expedition. Finally, he said: \"Chiang Kai-shek is afraid of us crossing the Yangtze River and reluctantly brought thirty-four brigades to 'chase' us. What's the use of that? Just wait for Commander Liu to issue an order, and the Yangtze will be crossed! Would he even dare pull out a single hair from our heads?!\" Liu You, a combatant liberated in Shao'erzhai, Puyang, said: \"Chairman Mao told us to fight battles that are prepared and have certainty of victory, this method is extremely brilliant. Chiang Kai-shek cannot do this, so they are beaten everywhere.\" Zhang Xijun, who was liberated in the Yangshanjie battle, believes that the Dabie Mountains are the most important, and can be used to attack Nanjing, attack Wuhan, cross the Yangtze River, and join forces with the Chen Su and Chen Xie armies. He said: \"Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is useless. There are also many poor people in the Dabie Mountains, which poor person doesn't want to turn over and divide the land? Who doesn't oppose dictatorship and national betrayal? That's why I decided to join the Liberation Army.\" Many veteran soldiers whose families are in the North China liberated areas all found Chiang Kai-shek's current method of building bunkers and roads around the Dabie Mountains very ridiculous. The experience of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan tells them that this is again the set of tricks of Okamura Neji, the Japanese war criminal who is now Chiang Kai-shek's guest of honor in Nanjing. They all said: Even Japan couldn't starve the Eighth Route Army to death back then, and instead brought about its own defeat, let alone Chiang Kai-shek today.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鄂豫皖某部学习毛主席报告  体会毛主席战略方针\n\n1948-02-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    鄂豫皖某部学习毛主席报告\n    体会毛主席战略方针\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十五日电】解放军某部在诉苦复仇运动的基础上学习毛主席的“目前形势和我们的任务”，现已获得显著的成绩。他们用对比方法，通过各人自己的经历和体验，使百分之八十以上的解放战士深刻的了解了毛主席的战略方针，和我军跃进长江北岸的主要战略意义，并嘲笑了蒋匪目前在大别山进行的防御性的“重点进攻”战略。在大杨湖战斗中被解放过来的机枪手傅永华在会上发言，他说：“我来的早，看到解放军一天比一天强大”。他叙述了大杨湖战斗、豫北战役、陇海战役，渡河后在鲁西南歼灭敌九个半旅，以至南征一千多里胜利到达大别山，最后他说：“蒋介石怕咱们过长江，勉强弄来三十四个旅来‘追’咱们，这有啥用，只待刘司令员下一道命令，长江说过就过，难道他还会扯掉我们一根毛不成？！”在濮阳邵耳寨被解放的战斗员刘友说：“毛主席告诉我们要打有准备有把握的仗，这办法顶高明。蒋介石做不到这一点，所以他们到处挨打”。在羊山集战斗中被解放的张希俊认为大别山最重要，可以打南京，打武汉，过长江，而且与陈粟、陈谢大军联在一块。他说：“蒋介石的进攻没有啥用。大别山也是穷人多呀，哪个穷人不想翻身分田呢？哪个不反对独裁卖国呢？我就是为了这才决心干解放军的。”很多家在华北解放区的老战士们，对蒋介石目前在大别山周围修筑碉堡公路的办法都觉得非常可笑。八年抗日战争中的经验告诉他们，这又是日寇战犯现在南京做蒋介石上宾的冈村宁次的那一套。他们都说：当年日本尚且困不死八路军，反而招到自身的败灭，今天的蒋介石就更不在话下了。"

The conference resolved to take action to resist the US government's provision of military supplies and other assistance to Chiang Kai-shek and the Dutch and French aggressors. This included the nearly 50,000-member International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has already decided to implement an embargo on foreign aid war materials. Earlier this month, the anti-Chiang aid movement in American student circles also began. This is a righteous action by the American people to aid the oppressed people of China and other countries in the Far East, and we express our highest respect to the American people.\n    In the past two years, progressive groups in the United States have continuously supported the just struggle of the Chinese people. The China and Far East Conference held in San Francisco in October 1946 adopted resolutions demanding that the US government withdraw its troops stationed in China and stop providing military and economic aid to Chiang Kai-shek for the civil war. Since last year, American progressive groups and individuals have continuously criticized the US government's reactionary policy toward China and supported the Chinese people's movement for independence and democracy. This \"National Conference on American Policy toward China and the Far East\" has a broader mass character, and its resolutions call for direct action.\n    American imperialists are trying to cover up their criminal acts of aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang within the United States. They tell the American people that the American imperialist government is aiding Chiang Kai-shek because Chiang Kai-shek's army is \"fighting for the survival of the English-speaking people.\" They attempt to portray the interests of a handful of banking tycoons and arms dealers on Wall Street as the interests of the entire United States and even the entire \"English-speaking people.\" But the American imperialists' arrogant conspiracy to aid Chiang Kai-shek and destroy China is not only against the Chinese people, but also a brutal attack on the interests of the American people. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the US government has provided Chiang Kai-shek with more than 4 billion US dollars worth of military supplies and loans to aid the civil war. American banking tycoons and arms dealers have obtained huge profits from this, while the entire burden falls on the American people in the form of increased taxes and inflation (rising prices). American financial capital is trying to deprive the American people of their basic democratic rights at home and is implementing a policy of starvation against the American people. Facts have proven that American imperialists are the mortal enemies of the American people, and the interests of the American people are completely consistent with the interests of the Chinese nation.\n    The righteous actions of the American people have given great encouragement to the Chinese people's war of liberation. The Chinese people also deeply know that the victory of the People's Liberation Army over the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek is also helping the American people. The great international unity between the Chinese and American people will be an important guarantee for the victory of the Chinese and American people in the just struggle against American imperialism.

    "content": "Letter from a Correspondent in Huguan Exposes the Former Taihang Fifth Sub-district Hospital Cooperative for Exploiting Peasants with High-Interest Loans\n    [This Newspaper's News] Four comrades, Guo You, Chang Ji, Wen Fu, and Liang Yu, correspondents in Huguan, revealed in a letter to this newspaper on the 14th the illegal behavior of the former Taihang Fifth Sub-district Hospital Cooperative in exploiting peasants with high-interest loans, requesting the responsible parties to quickly investigate and resolve the matter. It is said that:\n    Hospital No. 1 of the Fifth Sub-district Hospital was previously stationed in Qiaoshang Village, Sixth District of our county, and brought with it a production cooperative. Later, the hospital left, but the cooperative remained in Qiaoshang Village for production. We do not have detailed knowledge of which organ or troop is now leading them. We only know that they were originally led by the Fifth Sub-district, so we are making a suggestion to the Fifth Sub-district. Even if they are not led by the Fifth Sub-district, you can convey our thoughts to their directly subordinate troops for resolution. This cooperative has no business relationship with the masses; it only sells consumables and does not have the necessities for the peasants. The way they do business is just a facade; their main activity is lending money (at high interest rates). For every yuan lent, the monthly interest is twelve cents per yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of twelve percent. According to our understanding on the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, they had lent out 950,000 yuan in Qiaoshang and Wangjia Village alone. Many people reflected that the interest was too high and was draining them dry. A cadre from Shihemu once proposed: \"They are also engaged in production, and both sides (peasants and the hospital cooperative) should benefit. The interest is too high, and we request the higher authorities to negotiate...\" We accepted the feedback from the masses at the time and made a well-intentioned proposal to the cooperative's manager, Guo. He didn't say anything on the surface, still using the rhetoric of supporting the masses' production to deal with us. However, that same night, he sent people to Wangjia Village to force the cadres and masses to pay back the money, even demanding that they immediately sell their mules to pay the money. The small cooperative in Shizui Village was completely ruined by this cooperative. The Shizui Village cooperative borrowed 160,000 yuan from them around the tenth day of the fifth lunar month last year, and by the beginning of the eighth lunar month, they had paid interest three times, each time with compound interest. Originally 160,000 yuan, the first time they couldn't afford to pay the interest, so it increased to 198,400 yuan. The second time they couldn't afford to pay the interest again, so they drew up another contract for 26,000 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of twelve percent. The third time, they had to pay 50,000 yuan in interest. As a result, in three months, the 160,000 yuan, with principal plus interest, earning interest on interest, rolled over to 274,400 yuan. In the end, the cooperative didn't have enough to pay back the hospital cooperative, so they had to sell everything to repay their debt. We believe that such management is extremely inappropriate, and the leadership must quickly correct it.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 壶关通讯员来信揭露  原太行五分区医院合作社  放高利贷剥削农民\n\n1948-02-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    壶关通讯员来信揭露\n    原太行五分区医院合作社\n    放高利贷剥削农民\n    【本报消息】壶关通讯员郭有、常吉、文付、良玉四同志在十四日给本报来信，揭露原太行五分区医院合作社用高利贷剥削农民的非法行为，要求负责方面赶快检查解决。据说：\n    五分区医院一所，前在我县六区桥上村驻扎，并带有一个生产合作社。后来医院走了，合作社仍留桥上村生产。现在归哪个机关部队领导，我们并不详细了解。我们只是知道他们原由五分区领导，因之我们向五分区建个议，就不是五分区领导，你们也好转达他们直属部队想法解决。该合作社在业务上给群众毫无关系，净卖消耗品，没有农民的必需品。他们搞业务是个样子，主要是放帐（高利贷）。贷出一元钱，每月每元利钱一毛二分，合月利十二分。根据我们去年腊月二十四日了解，光在桥上和王家庄两个村，就放了九十五万元。好多群众反映利太大，把咱背干了。石河沐干部曾这样提出：“他也是搞生产，应该两下（农民和医院合作社）赚开，利太大，要求上级给交涉一下………”我们当时接受了群众的反映，给该社郭经理善意的提出时，他表面上亦没说啥，还是以扶助群众生产的论调应付我们。可是当天黑夜，即派人到王家庄逼着干部群众要款，甚至就得马上卖了骡子交款。石嘴村的小合作社，完全被该合作社背倒了。石嘴村自去年五月初十贷他款十六万元，到八月初几就上了三次利，每次都是利上加利。原本十六万元，第一次上利不起，就增成十九万八千四百元，第二次上利又上不起，又给立二万六千元的一张契纸，每月十二分行息，第三次就出了五万元利钱。结果十六万元钱，三个月时间，本上加利，利上赚利，滚到二十七万四千四百元，最后合作社连本带利不够医院合作社的了，只好全部收拾还了人家饥荒。如此经营，我们认为极不妥当，领导方面必须赶快纠正。"

    "content": "Taihang Fifth Special District Inspects Financial and Grain Work\n    Discovers Significant Grain Loss in Warehouses\n    Decides to Overcome Bureaucracy, Enforce Strict Regulations, and Reform Warehouse Cadres.\n    [Our Dispatch] The Finance Department of the Taihang Fifth Special District convened a meeting of chief accountants from the financial and grain departments of various counties on the 4th of this month to review last year's work and, in accordance with the spirit of the new system, to study methods for improving work. During the inspection, many very serious problems were discovered that urgently needed immediate resolution:\n    (1) Over the past year, the total grain loss in warehouses across the eleven counties of the entire special district amounted to ×××× shi of rice and wheat. Some of this was due to the grain being wet when collected as public grain, which then lost weight after drying. However, the main reason was poor warehouse management leading to losses. Many village warehouse cadres were landlords or rich peasant elements who abused their power to manage grain receipt and distribution, engaging in sabotage and falsely reporting weight loss. In Dashi Yan Village, Qi County, the warehouse director, Shen Guangyao, a landlord, was in charge of storing 150,000 jin of grain. After drying the grain, he falsely reported a loss of 11,000 jin to the county. After the leadership replaced him and conducted a stocktake, it was found that the actual loss was only 6,000 jin. In Zhao Zhuang Village, the village initially falsely reported a loss of 1,000 jin when settling accounts with the county, but then discovered an excess of 200 jin during grain distribution. In Bai Si Village, Ji County, 6,000 jin of corn was stored, and neither the county nor the district knew that 1,400 jin had been lost to insect damage over the summer. In Hui County, 39 out of 114 village warehouses are still managed by landlords. In the Fourth and Sixth Districts of Lin County, warehouses had not been inventoried for three years since their establishment. Last year, an inventory revealed that 23,000 pairs of military shoes, due to repeated transportation and careless handover procedures, could not be matched, were rejected by the troops, and could not be distributed. In Long Ao, Ji County, 68,400 jin of grain was stored, with losses reaching 2,522 jin.\n    The investigation revealed that the causes of this situation were mainly leadership and bureaucratic practices in warehouse operations. There was a lack of inspection at the village level, and even when inspections were carried out, they were perfunctory. In some cases, the situation of grain stored in villages for a year was not understood. Sometimes, village and district cadres could get away with reporting weight loss simply by mentioning it when settling accounts with the county. Village and district cadres have not been genuinely reformed, and in many villages, financial power is controlled by landlords, rich peasants, and bad cadres, resulting in serious losses of public grain.\n    2. The treasury cash management system also had many flaws. Every county had discrepancies in the inventory of grain coupons and cash. In many places, accounts did not match the treasury. When counties handed over funds to the special district, the special district did not count them. When disbursing funds, the special district simply sent out the same amount. The recipients also did not count the money in person, resulting in mutual discrepancies and making it impossible to assign responsibility. For example, Tangyin twice withdrew a total of 17 million yuan from the special district but the amounts were off by 184,000 yuan. When the special district received payments from Anyang, they were off by 23,000 yuan. Tangyin did not pay attention when collecting unified tax payments and accepted 142,000 yuan in counterfeit notes. Lin County also received 110,000 yuan in counterfeit notes. Tangyin only complained about inventory discrepancies but did not inspect the cashier, leading to the cashier, Chen Kejing, altering accounts and embezzling 280,000 yuan. The grain accountant in Hui County only managed his own accounts and did not help the cashier clear the inventory, and it was only recently discovered that there was a shortage of 700 jin of grain coupons in the inventory.\n    3. Grain and fund borrowing were extremely chaotic in various counties. County Magistrate Ma of Anyang, without the approval of the leadership, arbitrarily borrowed 240,000 jin of border grain and used it for relief, which could not be resolved and became an unresolved case. Troops stationed in villages borrowed grain indiscriminately without government allocation, issuing informal IOUs. Zhangnan County lent grain to troops, issuing receipts with only personal seals and informal notes, resulting in over 130,000 jin of grain that could not be accounted for or claimed. In many villages, accounts were disconnected from the treasury, with figures in the accounts but no grain in the warehouse.\n    After conducting a thorough review of last year's work, everyone studied new methods based on the spirit of the new system. In terms of warehouse grain storage, there was a special discussion on methods to reduce losses. It was decided to thoroughly reform warehouse cadres in conjunction with equitable distribution and overcome bureaucratic practices.

Similar price crashes to those in Chicago also occurred in Kansas City and Minneapolis.\n\nThe decline in New York stocks \"has fallen to a new low since June of last year\" (Associated Press). It is estimated that in the past week (February 4th to 11th), the value of securities has lost $3 billion due to the price decline. Moreover, even the stocks of the largest American monopoly enterprises, such as US Steel, American Telephone, General Electric, and Texaco, have begun to decline. According to a TASS report on February 13th: \"Accompanying this decline in securities prices will be a contraction of enterprises.\" American statistical agencies report that the number of bankruptcies of American enterprises has increased sharply this year. In the first five weeks of this year, a total of 503 bankruptcies occurred, compared to only 280 in the same period last year, and only 125 in the same period the year before last. \"Certain industries, including the manufacture of engines under one horsepower, hosiery, certain sectors of the textile industry, and the food industry, will all suffer severe reductions in production\" (US Commerce Daily). These situations make American monopoly capitalists feel bleak about the future. According to United Press, \"Market confidence has disappeared,\" \"The widespread growth of fear is a prelude to a general and rapid economic downturn.\" The Associated Press revealed that many bourgeois economists in the United States are panicking and unable to predict the future. The Democratic and Republican parties are \"mutually blaming each other for the market declines\" (Central News Agency, New York English dispatch), fully demonstrating the embarrassment of the American ruling class.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 经济危机的信号  美股票物价连续狂跌  已大大超过上次经济危机时跌落程度\n\n1948-02-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    经济危机的信号\n    美股票物价连续狂跌\n    已大大超过上次经济危机时跌落程度\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】纽约讯：美国物价与股票证券的狂跌，愈加猛烈，并使美国独占资本家的恐惧日益增长。塔斯社报导全美十三日的物价继续下跌，三十五种商品批发价格指数跌至一八六·三二，而一个月前为二○七·六一。合众社十四日的报导亦称：“商品价格暴跌已有达百分之三十点九者，饱受打击的五月小麦期货价格比其最高时降低百分之二十二点七，玉蜀黍降低百分之二十四点二，燕麦低百分之二十四点一，大豆低百分之二七点四，大豆油跌百分之二四点八，棉子油跌百分之二六点七”。甚至“糖亦跌价百分之一六点三，咖啡跌百分之二十，可可跌百分之八点二”，美国生产不多的“橡皮也下跌百分之十一点二”，家庭非用不可的“牛油下跌百分之四点九，鸡蛋下跌百分之二点六。”工业股票一般都比本年最高价格低落百分之八点五，美国市场上的伦敦股票低落百分之十一”，获利最丰的福特汽车公司股票亦告下跌，此种情形使华尔街老板们心神不安，据蒋匪中央社透露：“许多美国人士皆感疑虑不安，未悉物价之下落究将达到何种程度，是否各方畏惧已久之经济恐慌已经最后来到”。\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合报导：美国物价与股票证券连续狂跌八天之后，迫使全国各大市场借口纪念林肯逝世而于十二日歇业一日。截至十二日止，商品市场已出现了美国历史上最猛烈的跌价。据合众社称：“粮食零售价格的下降，大大的超过了一九二九年的暴跌”。芝加哥五月份小麦期货，每蒲式尔价格最高时为一月十六日的三元零六分五，而十一日的市场价格则为二元三角七分，五月份玉蜀黍期货，每蒲式尔价格最高时为一月十六日的二元七角零七厘五，至十一日跌落了六角五分二厘五，芝加哥大肥皂制造家于十二日将批发价减少百分之五。堪萨斯及明尼亚波里斯两地，亦发生类似芝加哥的物价暴跌。\n    纽约股票证券的跌价，“已降到去年六月以来的新的低度”（美联社）。据估计一周来（四日至十一日）证券价值已因跌价而损失了三十亿美元。不仅如此，甚至美国最大的垄断企业，如美国钢铁公司，美国电话公司，通用电气公司及德克萨斯公司等的股票，亦已开始跌价。据塔斯社十三日电报导：“随着这种证券价格的降落而俱来的，将是企业的萎缩”。美国统计机关称：今年美国企业的破产数目大增，自本年年初起五星期内，共发生破产案五百零三起，去年同一时期内则仅二百八十起，前年同期内只有一百二十五起。“某些工业，包括制造一匹马力以下的引擎制造业、鞋袜业、纺织业的某些部门和粮食工业的生产都将遭受到严重的消减”（美国商务日报）。这些情形，使美国独占资本家感到前景之暗淡，据合众社透露：“市场的信心已经消失”，“普遍增长的恐惧心，即是经济普遍急转直下的前奏。”美联社则透露美国许多资产阶级经济学家惶惶然无法预示将来的前途。民主、共和两党则“已以市场上的跌价互相谴责”（中央社纽约英文电），充分表现美统治阶级的狼狈。"

Reports from various sources: The economic volatility in the United States has begun to affect major economic centers in the capitalist world. The London stock market \"has seen a new wave of selling\" (TASS, 12th), with stock values falling by millions of pounds. Industrial stocks, especially oil stocks, have fallen the most. The value of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's common stock has fallen by 27.5 million pounds in seven days. In Australia, stock prices on the Sydney and Melbourne exchanges continue to fall, with a drop of 14 million pounds in three days up to the 11th. On the Sydney stock market, 69 industrial and mining stocks fell sharply. On the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in the Danish capital, shares of many large industrial companies and banks fell sharply. Shares of Nordisk Company fell by 5 pounds; shares of Glud & Marstrand hardware factory, Ford Motor Company, and others fell by 3 pounds; shares of Handelsbanken fell by 1.5 pounds. In addition, stock prices have fallen sharply in places like Singapore, Manila (Philippines), and Toronto (Canada).\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. London: The British economic situation continues to deteriorate. According to the recent \"Emergency White Paper\" released by the Labour Party authorities, Britain's trade deficit reached $2.7 billion last year, compared with $1.52 billion in 1946 and only $280 million in 1938. The White Paper believes that this continuous increase in the deficit is due to the difficulty of increasing exports to the countries that Britain needs the most (i.e., the United States, Canada, Argentina, etc.). The White Paper states that in the first half of last year, 47 percent of Britain's total imports came from dollar countries, while its exports to these countries accounted for only 21 percent of the total. To make up for this growing dollar deficit, the Labour government has had to use its limited gold reserves. According to Agence France-Presse on the 8th, citing well-informed sources in London, in the five months from September last year to the end of January this year, Britain sold $618 million worth of gold to the United States from its gold reserves worth $2.4 billion in exchange for U.S. dollars, and purchased $240 million from the International Monetary Fund. Of the $1.124 billion loaned to Britain by Canada in 1946, $500 million was used before August last year, and another $160 million was used during this period. In addition, $300 million was used from the remaining $400 million of the U.S. loan. In total, Britain spent $1.318 billion in these five months. Therefore, Britain is increasingly facing the danger of completely exhausting its gold and dollar reserves. Economic and Financial Secretary Cripps exclaimed on the 11th: \"There is a dangerous gap between what Britain earns from exports and what it spends on imports. If this continues, Britain's monetary reserves will only last for six months.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国经济的大风暴  迅速波及英澳等国\n\n1948-02-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    美国经济的大风暴\n    迅速波及英澳等国\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方讯：美国经济的大波动，已开始波及资本主义世界的各大经济中心。伦敦股票市场“掀起了新的抛售浪潮”（塔斯社十二日电），股票价值已跌落了数百万镑。工业股票，尤其是石油股票下跌最猛，英伊石油公司普通股票的价值，在七天内已跌落了二千七百五十万镑。澳州之悉尼和墨尔钵的交易所股票继续下跌，截至十一日止，三天内跌价一千四百万镑，悉尼股票市场中，有六十九种产业和矿业股票大跌。丹麦首都哥本哈根交易所中，许多大产业公司和银行的股票猛跌。诺尔提斯克公司股票跌五镑；格鲁德和马斯特兰五金工厂，福特汽车公司等股票跌三镑；韩德尔斯班肯公司股票跌一镑半。此外，如新加坡、马尼拉（匪律宾）多伦多（加拿大）都发生股票猛跌现象。\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】伦敦讯：英国经济情势继续恶化。据最近工党当局所发布之“紧急白皮书”称：去年英贸易入超达二十七亿美元，而一九四六年入超为十五亿二千万美元，一九三八年入超则仅二亿八千万美元。白皮书认为这种赤字之不断增大，乃是因为英国对其需要最多的那些国家（即美国、加拿大、阿根廷等）增加出口，有很多困难。白皮书称：去年上半年，英国进口总额的百分之四十七来自美元国家，而其对这些国家的出口，则仅占总额百分之二十一。为弥补这种日益增大的美元赤字，工党政府乃不得不动用其仅有的黄金储备。据法新社八日引伦敦消息灵通人士称：在去年九月至本年一月底的五个月中，英国已自其所值二十四亿美元的黄金储备中，向美售出了价值六亿一千八百万美元的黄金，以换取美元，同时从“国际货币基金”购进二亿四千万美元。加拿大一九四六年贷给英国的十一亿两千四百万美元中，除去年八月以前用去五亿元以外，这期间又动用了一亿六千万元。另外，自美国贷款余额四亿美元中，用去三亿元。总计这五个月内，英国耗用美元达十三亿一千八百万。因此，英国正日益面临黄金与美元储备完全耗竭的危险。经济兼财政大臣克利浦斯十一日为此大嚷道：“在英国输出所得与输入所费中，存在着一条危险的鸿沟。倘若长此以往，则英国的货币储备，仅能维持半年”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency\n\n    The plummeting of prices and stock values in the United States is the major event that has rocked the world this week. Since the straight-line plunge in prices began on the 4th, the drop has been fierce. In just the first few days, the prices of general commodities fell by 15.5% compared to a month ago, and on the 13th, the wholesale prices of 35 commodities fell even further by 20.7%. By the 14th, some commodity prices had plummeted by as much as 30.9%. The speed of the fall in grain prices “has greatly exceeded that of 1929” (Associated Press). Stock and securities prices also plummeted at the same time, with losses of $3 billion in just one week. This economic \"storm\" in the United States has quickly affected other capitalist countries. Stock markets in the capitals and financial centers of Britain, Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Philippines, and Brazil have experienced \"new waves of selling,\" with continuous and sharp declines in stocks and securities. At the same time, this news of falling prices is influencing the continued decline of securities on the American market.\n    The main reason for the current sharp drop in prices in the United States is the profound contradiction between huge productive forces and a shrinking market. On the one hand, domestically, American capitalists, in order to extract higher profits, artificially raise prices, resulting in soaring prices. Food prices alone rose by almost 40% throughout last year, but real wages were greatly reduced. This has greatly reduced purchasing power. At the same time, the increasing poverty of the broad masses of the American people and the existence of eight million unemployed have further shrunk the domestic market. On the other hand, abroad, the vast majority of capitalist countries are in the midst of economic difficulties. They simply do not have, or lack, the dollar gold to purchase American goods. The shrinking domestic and foreign markets have made it impossible to sell large quantities of American goods, and inventories are piling up. According to the \"American Economic Chronicle,\" inventories piled up in warehouses by the end of last year had reached $5 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion more than half a year earlier. This has led to a serious situation of overproduction.\n    It must be pointed out that the plunge in prices and stocks in the United States is a signal of the American economic crisis. The famous Soviet economist Varga predicted as early as a year ago that \"the outbreak of the American economic crisis will not be later than 1948.\" The current situation is even more obvious. It is no wonder that Wall Street bosses are \"increasingly growing with fear, fearing that this is a prelude to a general and sharp economic downturn.\"\n    Recently, several major events have also occurred in Southeast Asia. First, after the Communist Party of Burma established democratic regimes in central Burma and other places, it began a new wave of the national democratic movement of the Burmese people. Uprisings also occurred in the Karen areas of southern Burma last week. The mass revolutionary movements in many cities in the area, as well as the anti-tax and anti-rent struggles and armed activities of the vast number of peasants in central and southern Burma, are developing rapidly. Second, the people of South Korea have taken action to fight against the US imperialist plot to divide Korea. On the 7th alone, there were as many as 105 demonstrations, strikes, sabotage of railways, attacks on US-Korean outposts, warehouses, and other mass struggles in various parts of South Korea. It can be seen the scale and tenacity of the struggle. This is a serious counterattack against the vicious attempt by US imperialism to organize a puppet government in South Korea. Third, the situation in Indonesia has undergone tremendous changes. Under the pressure of the US imperialist so-called \"mediation,\" the Indonesian government was forced to accept the Dutch terms on the cessation of hostilities and resolution of political disputes on the 17th of last month, and officially signed the humiliating \"Renville Agreement,\" making Indonesia once again a US-Dutch colony; at the same time, the pro-American right-wing Hatta cabinet has been formed. However, although the upper echelons within Indonesia have compromised and signed the surrender document, the 70 million Indonesian people will never sign it! They will not stop fighting until they have completely shaken off the shackles of imperialism. The heroic actions of the Indonesian people in resolutely resisting the Dutch invading forces to this day are the best proof.\n    Good news of the rising tide of the people's movement in Western Europe has continued to arrive like snowflakes in the past week. The Italian People's Democratic Front has launched a nationwide election campaign, and Italian youth, women, and people from all walks of life are further uniting to prepare all the necessary conditions for victory in the upcoming election showdown. The French working class held another national mass demonstration on the 8th, and the call to \"defend peace and defend democracy\" resounded throughout the country. In Britain, in order to save the deteriorating economic situation, the Labor government, with the support of US imperialism, brutally launched a fierce attack on the impoverished lives of British workers, announcing that it would freeze workers' wages at the current level. This reactionary offensive has aroused sharp protests from the British working class. The National Union of Railwaymen with 759,000 members, the Electrical Trades Union, the Civil Service Association, and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions with 2.75 million members have unanimously rejected this reactionary policy and declared that they will launch a wage increase struggle. At the same time, this reactionary measure has also caused divisions within the Labor Party, with 20 Labor MPs expressing their opposition. The foundation of the Labor government is becoming increasingly weakened.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美英等国经济起了大风波  东方人民运动掀起新浪潮\n\n1948-02-18\n第2版()\n专栏：国际一周\n\n    美英等国经济起了大风波\n    东方人民运动掀起新浪潮\n    美国物价和股票价格的暴跌，这是本周轰动世界的大事。物价从四日开始直线般的暴跌以来，至今跌风猛烈。仅开头数天，一般商品价格较一个月前下跌了百分之十五点五，十三日的三十五种商品批发价格更下跌百分之二十点七，至十四日，有些商品价格竟狂跌达百分之三十点九。粮食价格暴跌速度“已大大超过了一九二九年”（合众社）。股票证券价格亦同时暴跌，一周中即因下跌而损失三十亿美元之巨。这次美国的经济“大风暴”，已迅速影响到其他资本主义国家，英、澳、加、丹麦、菲律滨、巴西等国首都及若干金融中心的股票市场，发生了“新的抛售浪潮”，股票证券都连续狂跌。同时，这一跌价消息又影响美国市场证券的继续跌落。\n    美国此次物价狂跌的主要原因，是由于庞大生产力与日益缩小的市场之间发生了深刻的矛盾。一方面在国内，美国大资本家为了榨取更高利润，因此人工地抬高物价，结果便百物飞涨，去年全年食物价格几已上涨百分之四十，但实际工资则大为减低。这就大大降低了购买力；同时美国广大人民的日益贫困，和八百万失业者的存在，使国内市场更趋缩小。另一方面，在国外，绝大多数资本主义国家都处于经济困难的苦海中，它们根本没有或缺乏美元黄金购买美货。国内外市场的日益狭小，使大批美货卖不出去，存货堆积如山。据“美国经济纪要”的材料，到去年底堆积在仓库里的存货，已达五百万万美元，较半年前激增了一百五十万万美元之多。因此形成了生产过剩的严重情况。\n    必须指出：美国物价与股票的暴跌，乃是美国经济危机的信号，苏联名经济学家瓦尔加早在一年前即已预计：“美国经济危机的爆发，将不会迟于一九四八年”，现在的情况是更加明显了。这难怪华尔街的老板们要“普遍增长着恐惧心，害怕这是经济普遍急转直下的前奏了”。\n    最近东南亚亦发生了几件重大事件。其一，缅甸共产党自在缅甸中部等地成立民主政权后，开始了缅甸人民民族民主运动的新浪潮。上周南缅卡伦等区也发生起义，该区许多城市的群众革命运动，以及中缅南缅一带广大农民的抗捐抗租斗争与武装活动，正日益展开中。其二、南鲜人民已行动起来，为反抗美帝分裂朝鲜的阴谋活动而斗争了。仅七日一天内，南鲜各地便发生了示威、罢工、破坏铁轨、袭击美韩哨岗、仓库及其他群众斗争事件达一百另五起。可以看出斗争的规模和顽强性。这对美帝组织南鲜傀儡政府的恶毒企图，是一个严重的反击。其三、印尼局势已发生巨变。在美帝所谓“调处”的压力下，印尼政府被迫于上月十七日接受了荷兰关于停战与解决政治纠纷条款，正式签订了屈辱的“伦维尔协定”，使印尼重新沦为美荷的殖民地；同时，亲美右派哈达内阁已经组成。但是，印尼内部的上层分子虽妥协而在投降书上签字了，七千万印尼人民决不会签字！它们不达到完全挣脱帝国主义枷锁的目的，是不会停止战斗的。印尼人民至今仍坚决反抗荷兰侵犯军的英勇行动，便是最好的证明。\n    西欧人民运动高涨的佳讯，一周来继续如雪片般飞来。意大利人民民主阵线展开了全国性的竞选运动，意青年妇女及各阶层人民正进一步团结起来，为未来大选的决斗准备一切必胜的条件。法国工人阶级八日又举行了全国群众大示威，“保卫和平保卫民主”的呼声响遍全国。在英国，工党政府为了挽救越趋恶化的经济形势，在美帝的支持下，竟残暴地向英国工人的贫困生活发动猛攻，宣布将职工工资固定于目前的水平。这一反动攻势引起了英国工人阶级的尖锐抗议，具有七十五万九千会员的全国铁路工人工会、电气职工会、公务员协会，及拥有二百七十五万会员的造船与机械工会联合会等职工会，一致拒斥这一反动政策，并声言即将发动增资斗争。同时，这一反动措施亦引起了工党内部的分歧，二十名工党议员已表示反对。工党政府的基础是愈来愈削弱了。 \n   （新华社）"

The Dutch imperialists' plot to use terror tactics in a vain attempt to suppress the Indonesian people's independence and liberation movement has now aroused extreme indignation among the Indonesian people; and they are \"determined to resist the invading forces\" (TASS, 12th). On the 12th, the Indonesian Youth Federation in Batavia sent a letter to the Three-Nation Mediation Committee, protesting the Dutch occupying authorities' imposition of martial law in Batavia, demanding severe punishment for the perpetrators of the massacres in West Java and other places, and abolishing the Madura puppet election and secessionist movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 荷军继续进犯印尼  印尼人民坚决抵抗\n\n1948-02-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    荷军继续进犯印尼\n    印尼人民坚决抵抗\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】巴城讯：自上月十七日印荷签订停战协定及哈达妥协内阁成立以来，荷兰侵略者更疯狂地发动军事进攻，并在爪哇各城大肆烧杀。据印尼通讯社报导：荷军仍不断攻击印尼军阵地，在西爪哇之加拉旺及东爪哇之玛琅等地区战事进行尤烈。印尼军自范、穆克分界线撤退后，在爪哇、苏岛即发生荷军暴行三十多起。上月二十六日荷兰寇军曾在西爪哇两个城镇残杀二百八十五名印尼居民，其中包括妇女与儿童，并焚毁房屋一百三十六所。此外，在巴城、泗水及西里伯斯之沙马林达诸城，荷兰侵略者监禁了六千名印尼人民，十四日有九名印尼爱国分子被屠杀。荷兰帝国主义采取恐怖政策，妄图弹压印尼人民之独立解放运动的阴谋，现已激起印尼人民之极端愤慨；并“坚决抵抗进犯军”（塔斯社十二日电）十二日巴城印尼青年总会已致函三国调停委员会，抗议荷兰侵略当局在巴城实施戒严令，要求严惩制造西爪哇等地屠杀血案之凶手，并废止马都拉伪选及分裂运动。"

    "content": "Moscow Broadcast Reveals\n    Chiang Kai-shek Clique Sells Out Sovereignty of Southwest China\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th – Moscow Radio broadcasted a commentary by Kibanov on the 8th, revealing that the Kuomintang is exchanging the sovereignty of South and Southwest China for American money. The commentary stated: \"Recently, in Wall Street, one can often encounter H.H. Kung, one of the comprador heads of the four major families, and Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank and a comprador of the Song family. These two fellows are paying homage to American capitalists, begging them to lend some money in an attempt to save the ultimately bankrupt Kuomintang regime. The current Kuomintang lords are indeed in a miserable situation, crying and wailing.\" It further pointed out: \"In order to make their master, the Americans, more generous, the Kuomintang reactionaries have tied China even more tightly to the chains of American enslavement. Zhang Qun swore in a letter to Truman that \"we will implement certain 'reform' measures,\" which is what this means. American monopoly capitalists are not satisfied with the Kuomintang giving them Taiwan and southern China. They plan to penetrate Inner Mongolia and southwestern and western China. Under the pretext of the Kuomintang reactionaries \"relieving the Mongols with charitable hearts,\" an American mission went to Inner Mongolia to study the possibility of American capitalists and the American army entering Inner Mongolia. In Yunnan, a capitalist named Charlie Carter and other American capitalists are working hard to seize the tin mines of Yunnan. The Renault expedition team, established in January and February this year, seems to be testing the height of the unexplored mountains in Qinghai, and using the excuse that the height of Mount Anymachen (i.e., Mount 積石) is higher than previously discovered. The Shanghai News revealed that the work the expedition team will engage in is to find uranium mines.\" The article emphasized: \"The Chinese people are very clear that no loan can save the dying reactionary Kuomintang regime. The reactionary Kuomintang adventurers have borrowed 483 million US dollars from the Americans, but the People's Liberation Army has not only not been \"defeated,\" but has gradually liberated the Northeast from the hands of the Kuomintang and is approaching Nanjing and Shanghai. The Kuomintang economic crisis has also worsened.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th – Nanjing News: The \"Sino (Chiang)-American Exploration Team Cooperation Agreement,\" a symbol of the deepening of the aggressive claws of American imperialism into western China, was signed in Nanjing on the 7th by American representative W. Hingston and Chiang Kai-shek clique representative Sa Pen-tung, and was formally approved by the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan on the 11th. The agreement stipulates that the team will be headed by Renault, manager of the American Atomic Pen Company, and W. Hingston, director of the Boston Museum, will be the exploration guidance director. The Chiang Kai-shek side will only appoint an \"honorary head\" and \"advisor.\" The team members include Major Yang Dize of the Nanjing US Military Advisory Group (who, in the late stage of our War of Resistance Against Japan, led American military personnel deep into Xikang and other places under the pretext of searching for American military remains). Each exploration will be accompanied by an American military liaison officer, fully demonstrating the military aggressive nature of the American undertaking. The main area of activity of the exploration team is between 96 and 103 degrees east longitude and 29 and 36 degrees north latitude (including the provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, and Sichuan). Within this area, the United States will use Chengdu as the main base and Lanzhou as the secondary base. Specially modified bombers will be used to carry measuring instruments and personnel. These aircraft can land in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and any other location. The team will conduct aerial and ground surveys and photography, one copy of which will be sent to the US for preservation. The exploration period is limited to three months. The agreement shows that the Chiang Kai-shek clique has granted the United States broad powers. The American side of the team can \"enter into contracts\" with any country or private organization. The agreement reveals that this aggressive activity by the United States involves the collection of information on defense, resources, and commerce in western China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 莫斯科广播揭露  蒋匪出卖华西主权\n\n1948-02-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    莫斯科广播揭露\n    蒋匪出卖华西主权\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】莫斯科电台八日广播基盘诺夫评论，揭露国民党正以出卖中国华南和西南主权，换取美帝金钱。评论称：“在最近这个时期内，在华尔街常常可以遇见身为四大家族买办头子之一的孔祥熙，和前中央银行总裁宋系大买办贝祖诒，这两个家伙正在向美国大资本家拜门请求借给他们一些金钱，图以挽救国民党制度的最终破产。现在的国民党老爷们的确是处于啼哭交加的悲惨情况中。”继指出：“国民党反动派为了使自己的主子美国人更慷慨起见，就把中国更紧紧的拴在美国奴役的锁链下。张群曾在给杜鲁门的信里发誓说：“我们将实行某些‘改良’办法”，就是这个意思。美国独占资本家对国民党让给他们台湾和中国南部，尚不满足。他们打算深入内蒙古及中国西南部与西部。在国民党反动派“以慈善心情救济蒙古人”的借口下，美国使团曾到了内蒙古，以便研究美国资本家与美国军队进入内蒙的可能。在云南，一个叫查尔利卡的和其他的美国资本家，正在努力将云南的锡矿抓到自己的手中。今年一、二月成立的雷诺考察团，好象是要测验在青海尚未勘察之山脉高度，并且借口说：阿尼马卿山（按即积石山）的高度比过去发现的还要高。而上海新闻报曾透露出消息称：该考察团将从事的工作是找铀矿。”该文着重指出：“中国人民十分清楚，知道无论任何的贷款都不能挽救行将灭亡的反动的国民党政权。反动的国民党冒险主义者已由美国人那里借到了四十万万八千三百万美元，然而人民解放军不但没有被“击溃”，相反地却把东北逐渐由国民党手中解放出来，并且已接近了南京和上海。而国民党经济危机也更加恶化起来了。\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】南京讯：标志美帝国主义侵略魔爪深入我国西部的“中（蒋）美探测团合作约文”，已于七日下午，由美帝代表华锡朋、蒋匪代表萨本栋在南京签订，并已由蒋匪行政院于十一日正式批准。约文中规定该团以美国原子笔公司经理雷诺为团长，波士顿博物馆馆长华锡朋为探测指导长。而蒋匪方面则仅任“名誉团长”及“顾问”。团员中规定有南京美军顾问团杨帝泽少校（他曾在我国抗战后期，以搜寻美军尸骸为借口，率领美军事人员深入西康等地活动）参加，每次探测时均由美国军事联络官随行，充分显示美帝从事此项探测的军事侵略性质。探测团活动的主要范围为东经九十六度至一百零三度，北纬二十九度至三十六度（按包括甘肃、青海、西康、四川四省省境），在此地区内，美帝将以成都为主要基地、兰州为副基地，以经过特别改装之轰炸机装载测量仪器及人员，此项飞机并可在上海、南京、汉口及其他任何地点降落，该团将进行空中及地面勘测与摄影，其中一份，送交美方保存。探测期限定为三个月。约文中显示蒋匪给予美帝广泛权力，该团美方可与任何国家及私人团体“订立契约”。约文中透露：美帝此一侵略活动涉及我国西部国防、资源、商业等多方面资料之搜集。"

    "content": "Peasants:\n\nOur newspaper welcomes everyone to accuse landlords of their crimes, expose shortcomings in our work, promote those things that our peasants think are good and appropriate, and put forward your own demands and suggestions for improving work. All organizations, groups, and individuals mentioned by everyone must state their position. Those who should make self-criticisms should do so, and those who should act according to everyone's opinions should accept and implement them. If there are incorrect statements, explanations can be made, and different opinions can be put forward. Those who can write should write themselves. Those who cannot write can find the newspaper's correspondents, reporters, and local cadres to write, or come to the newspaper in person, or write a letter to the newspaper to let us know, and we can find a way.\n\nWei Dianhua is fifty-six years old, from Xisu Village, Shahe Third District, and of poor peasant background. He is a Communist Party member and a retired veteran. However, he and his son were \"framed\" as \"spies\" by bad village cadres, and they were beaten to the point of death and still not released. Later, the masses bailed him out, but the bad village cadres still did not allow him to talk to anyone or leave the village. They also threatened him, saying, \"If you go to the county to sue, you don't need to return to Xisu Village.\" Last year in the twelfth lunar month, his son went to another village to carry persimmons and happened to see someone reading the newspaper, reading the part about Xu Geng of Nan Congjing in Wu'an appealing for justice. He knew that even the greatest grievances could be appealed, so he pretended to pack things up and took the newspaper, went home and told his father. Wei Dianhua took the newspaper and secretly ran out of the village, asking for directions all the way until he finally found the newspaper office. When he talked, he would cry and be unable to continue. He was afraid that the bad village cadres would beat his son again when they saw him run away. He asked the government to take charge for him and quickly send someone to investigate and deal with the matter. Below is his complaint, written on his behalf by a comrade from this newspaper.\n\n(I)\n\nMy family has been working as *mihan* (hired laborers) for landlords for three generations. My father and grandfather suffered for landlords their whole lives. My father died when I was four years old. There were thirteen people in my family, old and young, with only one uncle able to work. With many people and little land, we couldn't make ends meet, so we separated from my uncle in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu during a famine. We were given four *mu* of land. My mother and our siblings, five of us, I was the second oldest. When I was eight years old, we had nothing to eat at home, so I herded cattle for others. At first, I earned one string of five hundred cash coins a year, then two strings, three strings, up to four strings. I herded cattle and worked as a *mihan* for a full ten years.\n\nWhen I was eighteen, after the autumn harvest, there was no work and nothing to eat, so I carried a clay pot, gathered firewood in the winter, and worked as a *mihan* for landlords in the spring. I worked one year to eat for one year, and one year passed completely. I worked as a *mihan* until I was forty. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, during a great famine, my wife, children, brothers and I fled to Yuhuangshan in Tunliu, Shanxi, where we lived by cutting firewood. Everyone else in my family fled elsewhere, leaving only my mother at home. My mother longed for everyone, and was hungry and lonely, so she died of illness and anger.\n\nWhen I heard that my mother had died, I left my wife and children in the mountains, pawned a cotton coat for travel expenses, and rushed back day and night. When I got home, I didn't expect the neighbors to wrap her in a straw mat and help bury her! The next day, I hurried back because my travel expenses were not enough. If I delayed for one day, I couldn't go back, and my wife and children in the mountains would starve.\n\nIn the tenth year of the Republic of China, I returned from Shanxi. My older sister's husband died, so I found a husband for my sister, spent some money, bought three *mu* of land, and rented another four or five *mu* of land. My brothers and I worked as *mihan* for others, and we barely managed to avoid starvation year after year with coarse grains and vegetables.\n\nWhen the Incident happened, the Eighth Route Army came, and I joined the resistance work and worked as a messenger in the district. I also joined the Communist Party. In the forty-second year, a famine came, and the whole family fled to Shanxi again. I was transferred to the enemy work station to deliver letters. At that time, the enemy built three lines of blockade, and delivering letters required crossing two lines of blockade and one Shahe River. Once, when crossing the Shahe River, the water was high, and I was almost washed away. For the sake of work, the enemy damaged my right eye! After Japan surrendered, because I was getting old, the superiors called for demobilization. I requested to retire, and the superiors approved me as a second-class disabled soldier and sent me home.\n\n(II)\n\nAs soon as I returned home, I saw that the village cadres were all a bunch of landlords and rich peasants. Some had been puppet soldiers, some had been puppet police, and some had harbored bandits. Now they were still swaggering around and bullying the poor. I fought for eight years against the Japanese, but I couldn't even join the peasant association. Dissatisfied, I went to the district and county to sue them, accusing them of having bad backgrounds, accusing them of protecting landlords and rich peasants, and accusing them of embezzling fruits of the struggle. So, the village cadres all held a grudge against me!\n\nWei Jintang, the director of the militia committee, was a landlord who had been a puppet village chief. He was promoted to the district. They wanted to elect another director. The cadres arranged for Wei Jingwu to be \"elected.\" This Wei Jingwu's grandfather was nicknamed Red Beard, a famous local bully. He had never worked since he was a child. Later, his family declined, and he went to Yang Lanzi to become a bandit. He was captured by the Eighth Route Army and spent less than half a year before escaping home to work as a puppet soldier under Gao Delin. He was captured by us again while attacking the company kiln. He was in the Third Column. When he returned from the hospital, he saw the struggle going on and didn't return to the army. I opposed him during the election, and his hatred for me was even greater.\n\nIn October of the year before last, the cadres kicked me out of the house, put a tall hat on me, and held a meeting to struggle against me, saying that I often went to the Japanese blockhouse and was a \"spy.\" I said that delivering propaganda to the blockhouse was my revolutionary work. The cadres then led the crowd in shouting slogans: \"Oppose the spy's sophistry!\" When asking for opinions, the basic masses were silent, only the cadres Wei Jingyu and Wei Jingmei insisted that I was a spy, demanding that I reflect on who I had organized with. They forced me to ask for a Kuomintang certificate and a gun. I really didn't have one, so they said I wasn't being honest and beat me, almost killing me several times. I had no choice. My hair turned white with worry. I had to admit that I wanted to kill the cadres and kill everyone in the village. The cadres still didn't stop. They still held me back to reflect, treating me like a toy. They even expelled me from the party and returned my four months of party dues. The villagers only bailed me out for the New Year. After the New Year, the cadres arrested my son again, saying that Hua’s brother was a spy and had poisoned the high school he was studying at. He confessed that Wei Yongyan gave him the poison and also gave it to my son. My son didn't admit it, and they hung him from the beam. My son couldn't bear it and sneaked away that night. The cadres arrested me again. My son thought he couldn't escape, so he came back. If it hadn't been for a letter from the district head, he would have died long ago. I have three brothers, and he is the only son. My older brother is over sixty years old and has been single his whole life. They are all counting on this one person to carry on the family line. We knelt down and begged the cadres, begging everywhere to send us food. The village cadres just wouldn't let us go, and they wouldn't let my son confront Wei Hua's brother. Later, we had no choice but to release us, but they still withheld my demobilization certificate and wouldn't let me go to the county to collect grain. My son still wears a \"spy leg\" sign.\n\n(III)\n\nMy opinion is very simple. If the village cadres say I'm a spy, then they should say why I'm a spy and show some evidence. If they expel me from the party, they should explain why and give a reason. If Wei Yongyan gave my son poison, when and where did he give it, and who saw it? The chairman of the peasant association, Qu Meixi, his wife took poison from him, what was he carrying the poison for? My son is a \"spy leg,\" who is the spy head? They should also say. I worked as a hired laborer, carrying a clay pot, and I'm still poor and haven't turned over. Instead, they \"kicked me out\" and made me a spy. I fought for eight years in the war against Japan, unafraid of sacrifice. Sacrificing for the revolution is glorious. But if I die now, I will die too unjustly. I joined the Communist Party to seek light and find a way out. What did I really find? If I don't vent this grievance, I won't be able to close my eyes when I die.\n\nAnother opinion is, what should these village cadres be considered according to the new regulations? Are they qualified to be Communists? Some people were still feeding several mules a few years ago, all good land near the village. They just sold the mules and sold the land, and now they come to divide the fruits of the struggle, dividing more than anyone else. Is this the liberation of the poor or the liberation of the landlords? Doesn't the higher-level leadership inspect the work in Xisu Village?\n\nThere is also a point to raise to Guo Quan You (branch committee secretary), the political commissar Guo, he once said to me, \"Look how badly they've treated you?

During the research, everyone clearly understood the development and characteristics of the movement, discovered the consistency and contradictions in various materials, and then clarified various issues based on research and discussion. They assigned a person to be responsible for organizing the results of this research and writing a draft report, which was then reviewed and corrected by everyone before being submitted to the newspaper for publication. After publication, everyone further studied it among the masses to improve their work.\n\n    After working in Hexi Village for half a month, the comrades believed it necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the collected materials, explain the characteristics, and provide them to the Party newspaper. They convened a special meeting to discuss the situation. The study of the situation revealed that although many materials had been collected in the past, due to a lack of research, everyone had not distinguished the purpose of the investigated materials. Which were important and which were not? Many materials were not synthesized, so they could not be further improved. At the meeting, everyone raised some more comprehensive questions and went to the masses again to investigate, and then wrote a news report. This report represented their understanding and was prepared to be continuously revised and improved as the movement deepened.\n\n    Comrades in Tian'erzhuang Village combined the results of their investigations with their mutual ideological reflections to write a news report. In this way, they could publicize both the problems in their work and the problems in their personal ideology and work style to the masses, mobilize the masses to study the work of the village, and also provide them with the necessary supervision.\n\n    In places where mobilizing the masses and using the Party newspaper to promote work are consciously combined, farmers can gradually understand and use the Party newspaper. For example, after the Zhao Village news was published in the newspaper, the people of Zhao Village scrambled to read it, and some asked to correct their names. After the Shidong news was published, the masses said: \"The newspaper's coverage is not enough, we have more materials!\" An elderly poor peasant woman asked to have her opinion published in the newspaper, saying: \"Why publish Yinghui's mother's opinion and not mine?\" After the Hexi news was published, the working comrades systematically read it with the cadres and the masses. The masses were more motivated after reading it, and the cadres became more honest after hearing it, which was helpful to the movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 运用党报改进工作\n\n1948-02-18\n第1版()\n专栏：通讯往来\n\n    运用党报改进工作\n    武安九区有些村庄的工作同志，在做村的工作中有意识的做到运用党报这一武器，获得一些初步经验。可供参考：\n    赵庄村工作同志参加运动时，随时记下各方面材料，经常的互相汇报，交换情况，进行研究。在研究时，大家明确的认识了运动的发展状况和特点，发现了各种材料的一致性和有矛盾的地方，然后依据研究和讨论明确了各种问题。他们把这种研究的结果由专人负责整理，写成报告草稿，然后再由大家相互审阅校正，同意后即交报纸发表。发表后大家进一步在群众中进行研究，改进工作。\n    河西村工作同志做了半个月村的工作后，大家认为有必要把搜集的材料做一全面分析，说明特点，提供给党报。大家召开了专门会议对情况，一研究情况发现了过去调查的材料很多，由于缺乏研究，大家没分清调查的材料用处在那里？哪些是重要的，哪些是不重要的？许多材料没有综合起来，以致没能进一步提高。在会议中大家又提出了一些更全面的问题，分头再到群众中调查，然后写成新闻报导，这一报导代表他们的认识，准备在运动深入中继续修正、提高。\n    田二庄工作同志，把他们调查的结果，结合上他们彼此的思想反省写成新闻报导。这样，可以把工作上的问题和个人思想作风的问题，都公布到群众面前，发动群众研究村的工作，同时也给他们以必要的监督。\n    以上凡是有意识的把发动群众和运用党报推动工作结合起来的地方，也都能逐步地使农民认识党报，运用党报。譬如报上发表赵庄消息后，赵庄老百姓争相阅读，有的要求更正自己的名字。石洞消息发表后，群众认为：“报纸登的还不够，我们的材料还多着啦！”一位贫农老太太要求给自己登报，她说：“为什么登英会娘的，不登我的意见呢？”河西消息发表后，工作同志有计划的分头同干部群众阅读，群众看了劲头更大，干部听了老实，对运动有些帮助。"

Comrade Cheng Shilan was a native of Xingcheng County, Liaoning Province. After the fall of Northeast China, she studied in Beiping and actively participated in the \"December 9th\" student movement. During the student movement, she demonstrated strong organizational skills, serving successively as the Organization Minister of the Northeast Women's National Salvation Association, Chairman of the Northeast Middle School Student Union, and captain of the Pioneer Zone. She joined the Communist Party in December 1935. After the \"July 7th\" Incident, she joined the Jixi Guerrilla and came to the Taihang Region. In 1938, she served as the Secretary of the Yuanshi County Party Committee, where her work demonstrated vigor and the ability to break new ground. In 1939, the Taihang Regional Party Committee designated Licheng, Zuoquan and other counties as experimental counties, and Comrade Cheng Shilan was transferred to serve as the Secretary of the Licheng County Party Committee. In the winter of 1940, Comrade Cheng Shilan was transferred to serve as the Deputy Secretary of the Women's Committee of the Taihang Regional Party Committee. Soon after, she was transferred to serve as the Secretary of the Xingtai County Party Committee. In 1944, she participated in the rectification movement. After the rectification, she assisted in the rectification work at the Taihang Regional Party Committee Party School. In the spring of 1946, she came to Handan City to serve as a member of the Municipal Party Committee, and soon after became the Deputy Secretary of the Handan Municipal Party Committee. After returning from the Central Bureau's land conference, she was already five months pregnant and suffering from stomach pains, but she did not slacken in her work, frequently going to Pang Village, five miles from the city, to mobilize poor peasants and farm laborers. On the afternoon of January 26th, while going to Pang Village, she fell on the railroad tracks. She returned that evening and still discussed work with Director Cao of the Handan Municipal Public Security Bureau. Comrades advised her to rest, but she was unwilling to delay work due to concerns about the miscarriage. On the 27th, she continued to persist in her work, and only rested on the morning of the 28th, but ultimately passed away due to excessive blood loss and her stomach ailment, which could not be remedied. Comrade Cheng Shilan was a cadre who had experienced the student movement, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the land reform. She was relatively outstanding and excellent among women cadres. Through the Party's rectification and organizational consolidation, she had undergone significant transformation. Comrades who worked with her deeply mourn her death.

    "content": "Criticism and Suggestions:\n\nCivil Servant Zhang Chengzhan's Submission: Old Tenant Farmers in Shizhuang Village Are Too Impoverished\nPlease Yongnian Leaders Inspect the Truth\n\nI am a civil servant in the Political Department of ××. I participated in the people's movement in Shizhuang Village, Fourth District, Yongnian County. My name is Zhang Chengzhan. I am reporting something to you, and I ask you to point out a solution. Since we came to this village, the district and village cadres have not cared whether the masses have food or not. When the district cadres come to the village, they do not connect with the masses, but only with the cadres. They ask the cadres, \"Have the masses been liberated?\" The cadres say yes, they drink some wine, eat some meat, and leave. They simply don't care whether the masses are liberated or not. There is a big landlord in this village named Yu Benxiu. His family has two or three hundred mu of land and more than a dozen houses. Since the Eighth Route Army came, the bad men in his family have all run away, leaving only the old mother and more than a dozen women. More than forty years ago, he employed a tenant farmer. Until last year, when his family was struggled against, he stopped employing this tenant farmer. It wasn't that he couldn't afford to employ him; he was afraid of a thorough struggle against him. This tenant farmer is over seventy years old. He exhausted his strength working for him, and his health is poor. Now he has no land and no house. He lives in a temple, begging for food every day. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said, \"I am from Zhao Zhuang Village. My parents both starved to death. I suffered for others from the age of fourteen until now. They don't need me anymore, and I have no way to survive. I'm going to die soon!\" Tears fell from his eyes. Later, I told the village cadres, but it didn't help. One day, when I came back from eating, I saw the landlord, the master of this old tenant farmer, come out eating white flour meat buns. I hated him in my heart. I thought, this is a case of the poor not being able to truly turn over; the landlord still has plenty of white flour and meat to eat, and no one gives the poor anything to eat when they beg. The next morning, as soon as I went out, I saw this old tenant farmer carrying a stick and a small bag, walking and crying. I called him back, and he opened his big mouth and came to me to ask for food. I was not afraid of criticism from the cadres, and I didn't tell the cadres. I led him to his master's house to ask for food. I said, \"Hey! Give him some food!\" A young girl was standing in the yard. She reported inside. I looked inside and saw the old mother sitting on the kang, still using this young girl. I said to give some, and she said there was none. I said, \"Isn't there? There's a basket in the cupboard.\" She wouldn't give any. I became stern, and she took out two buns and steamed buns, six in total. As soon as I gave them to the old man, he burst into tears.\n\nThe temple where he lives has no bedding. I looked at the landlord's house. There were eighteen blankets on the three kangs, and there were so many chests, cabinets, and other things. Everyone, tell me, what kind of liberation is this? I think this situation is common, not just in this village. I ask the government to thoroughly resolve this.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 公务员张成占来稿说：施庄村老佃户太穷苦  请永年领导上检查真相\n\n1948-02-19\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n    公务员张成占来稿说：施庄村老佃户太穷苦\n    请永年领导上检查真相\n    我是××政治部的公务员，我在永年县第四区施庄村参加民运，我叫张成占，我向你们反映一个事情，请你们指出解决。自从我们来在这村，区干村干都不管群众有吃没吃，区干来到村里，不给群众接头，光给干部接头，他问干部；群众翻了身没？干部说翻了，他们喝上些酒，吃些肉就走了。他们根本就不管群众翻身没有。这村有个大地主虞本修，他家二、三百亩地，十多处房子，自八路军来了，他家男的坏家伙都跑了，光丢下老妈、女子十多口。他四十多年以前，用着一个佃户。一直到去年，他家被斗，不用这佃户了。他不是用不起了，他是怕彻底斗争他。这个佃户七十多岁了，给他做活把力用尽，身体不健康了，现在没地没房，他住在庙里，每天出来要些吃的东西。我问他：“你是哪里人？”他说：“我是赵庄村人，父母都饿死了。十四岁就给人家受苦，一直到现在，不用我了，我也没有法。我就快死呀！”他的泪就掉下来了。后来我给村干部说，也不顶事。我一天吃饭回来，我看到这个老佃户的主家——大地主出来拿着白面肉饱子吃，我的心很恨他，我想这是穷人翻身翻不了，地主白面肉还吃不清，穷人要饭也没有人给。第二早晨起来，我一出门见这个老佃户拿着棒子，拿着小口袋，走着哭着，我叫他回来，他就张着大嘴，就向我来要吃的东西，我也不怕干部批评，我也没给干部说，我领着他去他主家要吃，我说：“嘿！给些吃的东西！”有个小妮在院子里站着，她一向里报，我就往里一看，炕上坐着老妈，还用这满妮子，我说给些，他说没有，我说：“那不是？在柜上放着一筐子。”他就不给，我就起了态度，他拿出两个饱子、蒸馍共六个，我一给老汉，他张嘴大哭。\n    他住的庙，也没铺的，也没盖的。我看了看地主家里，三个炕共有十八条毯子，箱子、柜等等东西多的很，大家说说，这是什么翻身？我想不光是这村，普遍有的是这情况。我要求政府给彻底解决。"

    "title": "Vigorously Implement Streamlining and Thrift, Clean Up Assets: The Rear of East China is More Consolidated",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-19",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 17th: The East China Rear Area Consolidation Committee recently summarized the implementation and significant achievements of the three major plans—streamlining, thrift, and asset cleanup—over the past three months, stating that in November of last year, the East China Bureau High-Level Cadre Meeting passed a resolution to establish the East China Consolidation Committee under the leadership of the East China Working Committee. It established two groups, streamlining and reorganization, and asset cleanup, to lead and promote the specific implementation of each unit. The movement began in early November at the East China Bureau and the directly subordinate teams of the military region. In December, it swept across the field army, the rear units of Luzhong and Lunan, and the party, government, and military organs and troops of the Bohai area and various sub-districts. All units extensively promoted democracy, launched ideological struggles, and everyone exposed problems, confessed, and reflected until concrete implementation. To date, most units have entered the stage of establishing systems.\n\nThe summary pointed out the specific gains: (1) Streamlining the establishment: In the entire Bohai area, more than one-third of the personnel separated from production were streamlined, and thousands of cadres and tens of thousands of soldiers and miscellaneous personnel surged to the front lines or went to the newly liberated areas to work; after the livestock were concentrated, some formed large transportation teams, some were transferred to cavalry regiments, or enriched the front lines. (2) Cleaning up assets: The East China Working Committee and the directly subordinate units of the military region, as well as the rear units of Luzhong, Lunan, and the Field Army alone, cleared out more than 4 billion Beihai currency (the same below) (excluding medicine and communication equipment). The Bohai logistics department cleared out about 2.6 billion yuan. It is estimated that all assets in the Bohai area could reach more than 8 billion yuan, and the directly subordinate teams of the Bohai Military Region alone had as much as 12 billion yuan. This not only enriched the finances but also basically eradicated mountain stronghold mentality and unified and centralized materials. (3) In terms of lowering the standard of living and thrift: After the Bohai Daily implemented precise distribution methods, it saved 3.85 million yuan every day, and the annual savings could provide the entire year's vegetable expenses for 50,000 to 60,000 people. The military supply department's monthly cigarette expenses were worth more than 18 million yuan, which has now been completely cancelled. The military political department's public miscellaneous expenses in December last year were only one-tenth of those in September, but the work could still proceed as usual. From November last year to January this year, the military health department did not receive any expenses or rations, and even saved more than 40 million yuan. In particular, after canceling small kitchens and lowering the standard of living for cadres, the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity was restored.\n\nThe summary particularly pointed out that the implementation of the three major plans has more positive significance politically, economically, and ideologically. First of all: (1) It has reduced the burden on the people and improved the relationship between the Party and the masses. For example, the Bohai Daily can save more than 1.4 billion yuan a year, and Bohai area can reduce the burden of 150 yuan per person. (2) It has consolidated and strengthened the organization of the Party and the army, strengthened the Party's discipline, and educated the entire Party. In streamlining, the core leadership of the Party has been strengthened. After launching ideological struggles in everything through the Party's democratic congresses, all Party members have taken a step forward ideologically, organizationally, and politically. (3) It has cracked down on mountain stronghold mentality and severely punished corrupt elements. For example, the director of the 13th Hospital of the Military Health Department, the director of the supply department of the military officer training unit, and the production section chief of the First Military Sub-district of Lunan, and other corrupt elements have been punished. (4) It has enriched finances and stabilized prices. In particular, after unfreezing civilian labor, it has rehabilitated the productivity of the masses.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China, February 16th: The East China Field Army Liaison Office has achieved remarkable results in implementing the \"Three Major Plans.\" (1) It streamlined from 47 units to 27 units, and from more than 7,800 people to 3,400 people, enriching the front lines with half of the original number of people. (2) It corrected the serious phenomena of corruption and waste in the past (such as a certain director squandering 400,000 to 500,000 yuan of public funds in less than two months), and established a style of hard work and simplicity. Now, most female comrades can bring their children to participate in labor production, and some are already self-sufficient. (3) It cleared out 1,704 silver coins, more than 29.08 million Beihai currency, and more than 30,000 jin of grain and flour that individuals had kept. During the movement, they adopted the \"three questions and three comparisons\" method to open the door of thought. The three questions are: \"Is your contribution to the revolution greater or your enjoyment greater?\" \"Are there any places where you deceive the Party in the implementation of the Three Major Plans?\" \"Is your thinking and action keeping up with the current new situation?\" The three comparisons are: compare with the lives of the soldiers at the front, compare with the lives of the masters (hired poor and middle peasants), and compare with the lives before participating in the war. In this way, examine thoughts and life, carry out strict ideological struggles, and correct the idea of forgetting one's roots.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 厉行精简节约清理资财  华东后方更加巩固\n\n1948-02-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    厉行精简节约清理资财\n    华东后方更加巩固\n    【新华社华东十七日电】华东后方整理委员会近总结三个月来精简、节约、清理资财三大方案的执行情况及重大收获称：去年十一月华东局高干会通过在华东工委领导下，成立华东整理委员会，并设精简整编与清理物资两个小组，以领导推动各单位具体执行，十一月初运动即首在华东局与军区直属队开始，十二月间在野战军、鲁中、鲁南后方单位，与渤海党、政、军各机关部队，及各分区全面轰动起来。各单位广泛发扬民主，展开思想斗争，大家检举、暴露问题、坦白反省，直到具体执行。迄今多数单位已进入建立制度阶段。\n    总结指出具体的收获：（一）精简编制：全渤海区脱离生产人员精简了三分之一强，数千干部和数万战士、杂务人员涌上前线或赴新解放区工作；牲口集中后，有的成立了大运输队，有的调给骑兵团或充实了前线。（二）清理资财：仅华东工委及军区直属各单位及鲁中、鲁南、野战军等后方单位即达北海币（下同）四十亿余元（医药与通讯器财还不在内），渤海后勤部门约清出二十六亿余元，据估计渤海全区全部资财可达八十亿元以上，连渤海军区直属队就有百二十亿元之巨。不仅充实了财政，而且基本上铲除了山头本位主义，统一集中了物资。（三）降低生活水平与节约方面：渤海日报实行精确发行办法后，每天节约三百八十五万元，一年节约可供五、六万人的全年菜金。军供给部每月纸烟费折价一千八百余万元，现已全部取消。军政治部去年十二月的公杂费，仅值九月份的十分之一而工作仍能照常进行。军卫生部从去年十一月到今年一月的经费、粮草都没有领，还节存了四千余万元。特别是取消小伙房，降低干部生活水平后，恢复了艰苦朴素的优良传统。\n    总结特别指出：三大方案之执行，在政治上、经济上、思想上更有其积极的意义。首先是：（一）减轻了人民负担，和改善了党与群众的关系。如渤海日报一年可节约十四亿余元，就此一项，渤海每人即减少负担百五十元。（二）巩固与加强了党与军队的组织，严肃了党的纪律，教育了全党，在精简中加强了党的核心领导，在一切通过党的民主大会上，展开思想斗争后，使全体党员在思想上、组织上、政治上都提高了一步。（三）打击了山头本位主义，与严惩了贪污腐化分子，如军卫生部十三院院长，军官教导部队供给处处长，鲁南一军分区生产股长等贪污腐化分子都受到了惩处。（四）充实了财政，稳定了物价。特别是解冻民力以后，休养了群众的生产力。\n    【新华社华东十六日电】华东野战军留守处执行“三大方案”，成绩显著。（一）由四十七个单位精简为二十七个，由七千八百余人精简为三千四百人，将原有人数之半充实了前线。（二）纠正了过去严重的贪污浪费现象（如某处长不到两月竟浪费了公款四、五十万元），树立起艰苦朴素的作风。现在一般女同志都能带上孩子劳动生产，有的已能自给自足。（三）清理出个人保存的银币一千七百零四元，北海币二千九百零八万余元，粮食面粉三万余斤。运动进行中他们采用了“三问三比”方法，打开了思想的大门。三问即：“你对革命贡献大还是享受大？”“你执行三大方案中是否有欺骗党的地方？”“你的思想行动是否跟得上当前的新形势？”三比即：和前方战士的生活比，和主人（雇贫农中农）生活比，和参战前的生活比。这样来检查思想和生活，开展严格的思想斗争，纠正忘本思想。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th. The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions on protecting urban industry and commerce in the land redistribution movement. It pointed out that some counties have seen phenomena that violate the policy of urban industry and commerce. For example, if a landlord also engages in industry and commerce, his industrial and commercial assets are confiscated. In some cases, those who had completely or partially converted to industry and commerce after August 15th [1945] before the land reform were also completely confiscated, and even those who had been deprived of their land by the Japanese invaders and turned to industry and commerce are now being treated as landlords. The reasons for these phenomena are the misconception that the Northeast, after fourteen years of rule by the enemy and puppets, implemented a monopoly, and there are no longer any national industries and private capital; that state-owned and cooperative enterprises are not needed private capital in the future; and that they have neglected to publicize and explain the policy of protecting industry and commerce to poor peasants and hired farm laborers, narrowly hoping that the peasants will gain more ill-gotten wealth. If these errors are not corrected immediately, it will be very detrimental to the development of production, the prosperity of the economy, and the satisfaction of the peasants' own needs. The instructions specifically stipulate that landlords who are also engaged in industry and commerce should only have their land and other feudal exploitation parts in the countryside confiscated and usury abolished. Everything else should remain untouched. Pure industrialists and businessmen before the land reform in July 1946 should be protected, regardless of whether they were landlords in the past. Except for the industrial and commercial enterprises of big traitors, big bullies, big secret agents, and big landlords who occupy a dominant position in the entire county or city and are extremely sinful, the disguised landlords who engage in small businesses after the land reform to escape struggle, and the disguised industrial and commercial enterprises of counter-revolutionary Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, which should be resolutely confiscated, other industrial and commercial entrepreneurs who have made some mistakes and shortcomings in the past but now obey government laws and decrees can be asked to confess their political mistakes and repent. Their industrial and commercial property and assets should not be confiscated or arbitrarily fined under any pretext. From now on, peasants are not allowed to directly seize factories and stores, directly confiscate the property of industrialists and businessmen, or arrest and fine people. As for the above-mentioned regulations that big traitors, bullies, landlords, Chiang Kai-shek's special agent disguised landlords and their industrial and commercial enterprises can be arrested and confiscated, it must also be reviewed and approved by the county and municipal government, and executed by the county and municipal public security bureaus, and then handed over to the relevant peasants or relevant agencies. After the confiscation, except for large industrial and commercial enterprises that are handed over to the government for processing so that they can continue to operate, others should not be dispersed and abandoned. Whether cooperative management or resale, it should be continued. The instructions also stipulate that private seizure, confiscation, arrest, and fines without the county, municipal government, and public security bureau are illegal acts. If peasants request to enter the city to settle accounts with industrial and commercial enterprises, the local responsible cadres should review and study them with a responsible attitude according to the party's policies, and explain them to the peasants to prevent dissatisfaction. At the same time, all localities should discuss the policy of protecting industry and commerce in detail at the congresses of poor peasants, hired farm laborers and representatives.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地主兼工商业者  不动工商业部分  合江省委发出指示\n\n1948-02-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    地主兼工商业者\n    不动工商业部分\n    合江省委发出指示\n    【新华社东北十七日电】中共合江省委日前特颁发平分土地运动中，保护城市工商业的指示。指出：有些县已发生了违反城市工商业政策的现象。如地主兼营工商业的，他的工商业被没收。有的是“八一五”后土改前已全部或部分转为工商业的，也被全部没收，甚至过去被日寇夺去了土地而转为工商业的，现在还当作地主处理。发生这些现象的原因是误认为东北经敌伪十四年统治，实行过专卖，已没有民族工商业和私人资本；今后有国营和合作社不需要私人资本；以及忽视向贫雇农宣传解释保护工商业政策，狭隘的希望农民多得点浮财。这些错误如不立即纠正，对发展生产，繁荣经济，和满足农民本身需要都很不利。指示特规定：地主兼工商业的只没收乡村中土地及其它封建剥削部分、废除高利贷。其他一律不动。一九四六年七月土改前的纯工商业者，不管过去是否地主一律保护。除在全县、全市占统治地位，罪大恶极的大汉奸、大恶霸、大特务、大地主的工商业，土改后为逃避斗争搞点小买卖的化形地主，和反革命蒋特的伪装工商业，坚决没收外，其他过去有点错误和缺点，而现在服从政府法令的工商业者，可要他政治上坦白改过，不能借故没收其工商业及财产，或任意罚款。今后农民不得直接查封工厂、商店，直接没收工商业者的财产或捕人罚款。至于上述规定可逮捕没收大奸霸地主、蒋特化形地主和其工商业，也须经县、市政府审查批准，由县、市公安局执行，然后交给有关农民或有关机关。没收后除大工商业交政府处理使其能继续营业外，其他也不应分散荒废。无论合作经营或转卖，应使之继续开办。指示并规定：不经县、市政府和公安局，私自查封、没收、捕人、罚款都是非法行为。农民要求入城清算工商业，当地负责干部，应以负责态度，根据党的政策审查研究，并向农民解释。不使其发生不满。同时各地应在贫雇农大会和代表会上，将保护工商业政策详细讨论清楚。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jinsui, 17th—The Jinsui Military Region Headquarters has recently issued a communiqué on its war achievements in 1947, stating: Over the past year, our Jinsui local armed forces and parts of the field army have actively fought, forcing the Yan and Fu bandits into a state of full defense. Major battles include: the Fen-Xiao Campaign in the spring, in which our army, in coordination with the Taiyue fraternal troops, captured Wenshui and Xiaoyi; the Yanbei Campaign in March, and the offensive operations by our local armed forces in Jin-Southwest in April and May, recovering Xiangling, Puxian, and Fenxi, and in coordination with the Taiyue troops, recovering cities such as Huoxian, Hongdong, and Zhaocheng, cutting off the Tongpu Railway, making Linfen and Taiyuan completely isolated, and powerfully supporting the operations in the Jin-South, Zhengtai, and Northwest battlefields. Following the anti-grain grabbing struggle in the summer and autumn, our army recovered Xiangning and Jixian in October, completely annihilating the defending enemies. Thus, all the Yan-puppet political bandits who roamed southwest Jin were wiped out, and the broad masses of the area were completely liberated. Land reform is now being vigorously carried out.

The next morning, the masses quietly spread the word, \"Our guerrillas came back last night and wrote slogans on the walls!\" When the enemy Ba長 (head of the Pao-Chia system) found out, he rushed to report to the company headquarters. The company commander said fiercely, \"That's impossible, I'm sure even the ghost of a guerrilla wouldn't dare to come in.\" Before he finished speaking, the sentry ran in to report, and took out many red and green slogans. The company commander ordered the Ba長: \"Quickly send someone to erase the slogans.\" The common people who were sent used iron shovels to scrape off the ink marks stroke by stroke, and the more they scraped, the deeper it became, and the five characters \"Long Live Chairman Mao\" looked like they were carved in. The company commander cursed, and ordered the soldiers to scrape off the character \"Mao\" and write the character \"Chiang.\" But the next day the character \"Chiang\" was gone, and it was still \"Long Live Chairman Mao.\" This was changed back and forth for several days, and the enemy was terrified, so they had to add sentries and specially assign sentries to guard that slogan. On this very night, not long after the changing of the guard, three people came from outside the village, one carrying a basket and a brush, one carrying a rolling pin, and the leader carrying a lantern and calling out \"Ma Wazi, come home!\" Two people responded, \"Coming home!\" The enemy sentry hurriedly asked, \"What are you doing?\" The one carrying the lantern answered loudly, \"Going to the Lord's Temple to call my child's soul back.\" The three people walked into the village like this, and when they reached the slogan, the one carrying the rolling pin first knocked down the sentry, the one carrying the lantern stabbed the sentry with a knife, the one carrying the brush wiped off the character \"Chiang\", took out brush and ink from the basket, wrote the character \"Mao\", put the red and green leaflets on the road, and the three people walked out of the village again calling out.

    "content": "Mao Zedong\n    By A. Strong, translated by Fu Ke\n    I.\n    In a cave dwelling high in the mountains, above the hot, green valleys shaped by years of labor, lives one of the most advanced thinkers of modern times, Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party. The civil war and the War of Resistance Against Japan have isolated him from the world; he has lived within a ring of blockade for twenty years. But during this period, he has never been separated from his people. Mao Zedong's ideas have pierced the blockade, inspiring the Chinese revolution.\n    Mao Zedong's genius manifests itself vividly in all aspects. It is precisely due to the strategies he formulated that an army surrounded by a technologically superior enemy has been able to establish and develop itself.\n    Liu Shaoqi, considered China's most famous Marxist theoretical scholar, told me:\n    \"Mao Zedong has researched and developed the theory of applying Marxism under Chinese conditions, transforming Marxism into a weapon for 450 million people. Mao Zedong's book, 'On Protracted War,' correctly pointed out the path for the Chinese people to resist the Japanese aggressors, and the 'On New Democracy,' published in 1940, provided an accurate analysis of the path of democratic revolution development under the present conditions. These theories determine the form of national organization in the Chinese democratic areas. Mao Zedong's analysis of the path for the Chinese people to achieve independence, democracy, and prosperity is being studied by communists in India, Japan, and all of Southeast Asia.\"\n    I first met Mao Zedong in August 1946.\n    Our car roared along the rocky riverbed of the Yan River, following the stone gate of the mountain ravine that blocked the entrance to the valley. At that time, members of the Central Committee lived inside. The slopes of the loess hills, with many platforms carved out, had been comfortable for the Chinese people living in the northwest for generations.\n    Facing a platform with four cave dwellings was the residence of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party.\n    Mao Zedong—tall, steady, and reserved, with the demeanor of a farmer. His round face, beneath thick black hair, had a broad forehead and deep, thoughtful black eyes that seemed to project deep insight and calm composure. Yet, when he smiled, they sparkled with lively humor.\n    He wore a brown cotton uniform, the same worn by three million soldiers of the People's Army and government officials. His manner was harmonious, without any impatience, creating an atmosphere of quiet friendship.\n    As we sat under the trees on the flat clay platform, Mao Zedong's beautiful, dark-haired wife prepared to receive us. Mao Zedong's beloved daughter, dressed in bright cotton clothes, played by her father's legs. Sometimes she knelt before her father, received a pat, and then went back to play on the ground.\n    Even at the very beginning of our conversation, I noticed someone on the slope of the mountain, about fifty feet above Mao Zedong's cave dwelling, watching us. \"Who is that?\" I asked, thinking: how easy it would be to throw a bomb onto our platform from above! Didn't Mao Zedong's residence have guards?\n    \"Those are the neighbor's children,\" Mao Zedong replied. \"They are curious about me hosting a foreign female guest...\"\n    The children watched from above, but without making a fuss.\n    Mao Zedong answered my questions sincerely and very frankly.\n    \"The Chinese Communists are fighting because Chiang Kai-shek's army came to massacre peaceful residents. And these residents, wanting to live, have to defend themselves,\" he replied.\n    \"Will the Communists fight for a long time?\"\n    \"If we could have our way, we wouldn't want to fight for even a day. However, if we must fight, we will fight until there is no need to fight anymore. We have already fought for twenty years; if necessary, we will fight for another twenty years—until complete victory.\"\n    Mao Zedong's conversation, full of vivid imagery and contrasts, was exceptionally precise, lively, and poetic.\n    For example, referring to the American weapons seized by the Communists, he called it \"America giving blood transfusions to Chiang Kai-shek, and Chiang Kai-shek giving blood transfusions to us.\" And he referred to the counter-revolutionary rulers as \"paper tigers\" (these paper things are made for Chinese festivals).\n    \"They have a very fearsome appearance,\" he said, \"but once rained on, they rot into mud.\"\n    Mao Zedong told me that he considered the talk about a US-Soviet war to be a smokescreen created by reactionaries to conceal their true intentions and make capitalist countries submit to US control.\n    II.\n    Mao Zedong received a broad and diverse education. He studied at Peking University during the eventful years of 1919 and 1920, when students united by the famous \"May Fourth\" Movement actively fought for Chinese national interests.\n    Mao Zedong is a scholar of Chinese classical literature and a profound critic of Chinese opera. To explain a situation, he would naturally and frequently cite from memory. He is an extraordinary poet, but he did not spend much time on poetry.\n    Mao Zedong became a Marxist in 1920, when the Russian Revolution awakened advanced Chinese thought. The following year, Mao Zedong attended the first Congress of the Chinese Communist Party; only twenty delegates attended this meeting. During the years when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party formed a united front, Mao Zedong held important positions in both parties. But after Chiang Kai-shek organized a counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Kuomintang offered a reward of 250,000 yuan for Mao Zedong's head.\n    Eighteen years ago, when the illegal Chinese Communist Party was divided by internal disagreements, when defeatists believed that the revolution was forever suppressed, and adventurers insisted on immediately occupying large cities, Mao Zedong, in summarizing, proposed the possibility of establishing democratic areas in China. He believed that such areas could be established in the mountains, at the junctions of several provinces. And then this area should become a base for spreading the liberation movement throughout the country. Several such areas were established twenty years ago, and they have now been linked together to form today's vast liberated areas.\n    Mao Zedong has never been abroad. He spent twenty years in the inland provinces, and even during these twenty years, for most of the time, he had no postal contact with other places. But Mao Zedong still has a world vision. In a conversation with me at the end of August 1946, he quoted Zhdanov's speech on literary issues. In the cave dwelling with party newspapers and radios, people were recording everything happening in the world day and night.\n    To expand his knowledge in all aspects, Mao Zedong often talked with farmers about farming; from these conversations, a \"Great Production Movement\" was born, which saved the border region from starvation during the blockade. In my conversations with him, Mao Zedong enthusiastically told me about everything in the United States—its political and economic life and its daily conditions—and was interested. If foreign journalists came to him, Mao Zedong would inquire in detail about all the countries they had seen.\n    III.\n    My last conversation with Mao Zedong was in February 1947, before I left Yan'an.\n    At that time, the threat of bombing and advancing troops had forced the evacuation of women, children, and non-combat organizations, and Mao Zedong and the secretaries of the Central Committee (as in the original text - editor) had moved to secluded cave dwellings more than a dozen miles outside the city. But that evening, they came into the city to see the performance of a new play about land reform.\n    After the performance, Mao Zedong received me in a vacant cave dwelling that had been uninhabited for a long time. Messengers brought heaters there—for warmth; candles—for light; and the farewell dinner included tea, pumpkin seeds, snacks, and candied peanuts.\n    Mao Zedong reminded me that I should fly away on the last American plane.\n    \"Otherwise,\" he said, \"it might be a year or more before we can send you away.\"\n    No matter how serious the situation was, Mao Zedong and his comrades were very calm and full of confidence in the final victory; in their conversations with me, they talked about the \"Great Counter-Offensive\" decided to begin in the autumn of 1947.\n    The last plane brought me a letter from a friend in New York. The letter was full of anxiety and unease. \"Difficult and arduous times await us. Our progressive activists cannot influence American foreign policy for a while. I hope the Chinese Communists have no illusions that the American government can do anything.\" I told Mao Zedong about the letter, and he smiled. Indeed, he had no illusions. But he believed that the American progressives were too intimidated by the American reactionaries. \"American imperialism is powerful,\" Mao Zedong said, \"but at the same time, it is also weak. It is necessary to understand its powerful nature and its weak nature. The American reactionaries bear a heavy burden.\" He continued with a smile, \"He has to support the reactionaries all over the world. If he cannot support them, then the building erected on a shaking pillar will collapse.\"\n    When I talked about the atomic bomb, Mao Zedong said:\n    \"The production of the atomic bomb is the beginning of the death of American imperialists, because they only rely on bombs. The end will not be bombs eliminating the people, but the people eliminating the bombs.\"\n    Our conversation ended at midnight.\n    The next morning, I flew to Peiping, and Mao Zedong moved to a cave dwelling deeper in the mountains.\n    In the villages of North China and Manchuria, there is abundant confidence that the people will persevere to victory, that the people's cause, the cause of freedom and a democratic nation, will grow and develop.\nTranslated from the Soviet Literature newspaper, October 10, 1947\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 毛泽东\nＡ·史特朗\n1948-02-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    毛泽东\n    Ａ·史特朗作  付克译\n    一\n    在高高的山上的窑洞里，在由于人们长年劳动而变得绿油油的炎热的山谷上，住着一位现代最先进的思想家，中国共产党的领袖毛泽东。国内战争和抗日战争使得他和世界隔绝着，他在封锁圈里过了二十年。但在这一时期内他并没有同自己的人民分开。毛泽东的思想穿过封锁圈鼓舞着中国的革命。\n    毛泽东的天才从各方面鲜明地表现了出来。而正是由于他制订出的战略，一个被技术优越的敌人包围着的军队，才能够建立与发展。\n    在中国被认为最著名的马克斯主义理论的博学家刘少奇告诉我说：\n    “毛泽东研究出在中国条件下运用马克思主义的理论，把马克斯主义变成了四万万五千万人民的武器。毛泽东的‘论持久战’一书，正确地指出了中国人民对日本侵略者反抗的道路，而一九四○年发表的‘新民主主义论’一书中，则对现条件下民主革命发展的道路作了确切的分析。这些理论确定了在中国民主地区的国家组织形式。毛泽东给予中国人民达到独立民主繁荣的道路的分析，为印度、日本和所有东南亚的共产党人所研究着。”\n    我同毛泽东第一次相会，是在一九四六年的八月。\n    我们的汽车沿多石的延河的河床鸣叫着，顺着山沟的石头大门挡住了到沟里去的入口。当时里边住着中央委员会的委员们。开凿了很多平台的黄土山岗的山坡，几世来对于居住在西北地方的中国人是舒适安逸的。\n    面向着一个平台的四孔窑洞，便是中国共产党的领袖毛泽东的住宅。\n    毛泽东——高高的身材，为人稳重谨严，有农民的风度。他的圆圆的脸上，在丛密的黑发下面是宽宽的额头和深思的黑眼睛，似乎透射出深谋远虑和镇定安详，然而当他微笑时，便发出活泼幽默的光亮。\n    他穿着褐色棉布制服，三百万的人民军的战士和政府职员都是穿着这样的制服的。他的举止是和谐的，没有一点急燥，使人感到安静的友情的气氛。\n    我们坐在平坦的黏土平台的树下时，美丽的，黑发的毛泽东的妻子准备招待我们了。毛泽东的爱女穿着鲜亮的棉布衣，在爸爸的腿边玩着，有时她两膝跪在爸爸面前，得到抚摸之后，便又走到地上去。\n    还是在我们谈话刚开始时，我发现在山岗的斜坡上，在毛泽东的窑洞上边五十英尺左右的地方，有人在瞧我们。“那里是谁？”我问，我想：从上边向我们的平台扔炸弹是多么容易呢！难道毛泽东的住宅没有哨兵在守卫着吗？\n    “这是邻家的孩子们，”毛泽东回答。“他们为我这儿招待一位外国女客而感到新奇呢……”\n    孩子们在上边注视着，但没有吵嚷。\n    毛泽东诚恳地，非常坦直地回答着我的问题。\n    “中国共产党人进行斗争，是因为蒋介石的军队来屠杀和平居民。而这些居民们因为想活命，便得自卫。”他答。\n    “共产党人是不是要长久的作战下去呢？”\n    “事情如果由我们作主，那我们本来是一天也不愿意打的。然而如果我们非打不成时，我们将要打到不需要打时为止。我们已经打了二十年了；假如需要，我们将再打他二十年——直到完全胜利。”\n    毛泽东的富有鲜明形象和对比的谈话，是异常确切的，同时特别活泼生动而富于诗意。\n    例如，提及关于共产党人夺取的美国武器时，他称之为“美国人给蒋介石输血和蒋介石给我们输血”。而对反革命的统治者们，他则称之为“纸老虎”（这些纸糊的东西是为了过中国的节日所制的）。\n    “他们有一幅非常可怕的样子，”他说：“可是给雨水一淋，他们就烂成泥了。”\n    毛泽东告诉我：关于美苏战争的说法，他认为是反动分子们制造的烟幕，好掩盖他们真实的企图，使资本主义国家都服从于美国的控制。\n  二\n    毛泽东受过广泛的多方面的教育。他在北京大学学习时，正是为事变所丰富的一九一九和一九二○年的年代，那时为有名的“五四”运动所团结起来的大学生们，积极地为中国民族利益而战斗着。\n    毛泽东——中国古典文学的博学家，中国歌剧艺术的深刻的评论家。为了解释一种情况，他自然地多次地引证了记忆里的东西。他是非凡的诗人，但他在诗文上并未花去许多时间。\n    毛泽东在一九二○年就成为马克斯主义者了，那时的俄国革命唤起了先进的中国思想。第二年毛泽东参加了中国共产党第一次代表大会；出席这个会的只有二十个代表。当国共两党结成统一战线的年代中，毛泽东在两党中均占着重要的位置。可是当蒋介石组织反革命叛变之后，国民党便以二十五万元的赏格来征求毛泽东的头。\n    十八年前，当不合法的中国共产党因党内意见不同而分歧时，当失败主义者们认为革命是永远被镇压下去了，而冒险主义们却坚持立刻占领大城市时，毛泽东于总结时提出了在中国建立民主地区的可能性。他认为这种地区可以建立在山里，建立在几个省份的交界地带。而然后这地区就应成为在全国传播解放运动的根据地，在二十年前就建立了数个这样的地区，现已联结成今天广大的解放区了。\n    毛泽东一次也没有出过国。他在内地各省渡过了二十年，甚至在这二十年中，大部分时间同其他地方连邮政的联系都没有。但毛泽东仍然具有世界的眼光。一九四六年八月底在和我的谈话中，他引证了日丹诺夫关于文学问题的讲演中的话。在放着党报和电台的窑洞里，人们不分昼夜地在记录着世界上所发生的一切事情。\n    为了在各方面扩大自己的知识，毛泽东经常和农民们谈论农事；从这些谈话中，产生了一个“大生产运动”，这运动在被封锁期间，挽救了边区而免于饥饿。在同我的谈话中，毛泽东兴致勃勃地，对我告诉他关于美国的一切事情——美国的政治经济生活及其日常状况，都感到兴趣。如果外国记者到他那儿，毛泽东便详细地询问他关于所有看见过的国家。\n  三\n    最后一次我同毛泽东的谈话，在一九四七年的二月，是我要离开延安之前。\n    那时轰炸和进兵的威胁，已迫使在疏散妇女、孩子和非战斗机关，而毛泽东和中央委员会的书记（原文如此——编者）们，搬到离城十几里以外荫蔽的窑洞里去了。但是这天晚上，为了看土地改革的新剧的上演，他们进城来了。\n    演完后毛泽东在一个久无人住的空窑洞里接待了我。通讯员把暖炉带到那里——为了取暖；蜡烛——为了取光；送别的晚餐上预备了茶、南瓜子、点心和粘糖的花生米。\n    毛泽东提醒我，应该乘最后的美国飞机飞走。\n    “不然”他说：“可能得过一年或者更久之后，我们才能把你送走。”\n    不管情况多严重，毛泽东和他的战友们非常镇静和充满着最后胜利的信心；在同我的谈话中他们谈到了决定于一九四七年秋天开始的“大反攻”。\n    上一次的飞机给我带来了我一个纽约朋友的信。信是充满惊恐不安的信。“艰难困苦的时间在等待着我们。我们进步的活动家们一时是不能给予美国对外政策以影响的。我希望中国共产党人没有任何幻想，认为美国政府能作什么事情。”我把信告诉给毛泽东，他微笑了一下。真的，他没有任何的幻想。但他认为美国的进步分子，太过份地为美国反动分子所恐吓住了。“美帝国主义是强大的”毛泽东说，“但同时他也是虚弱的。需要了解其强大的性质和其虚弱的性质。美国反动分子担负着艰难的重荷。”他微笑着继续说：“他得援助全世界的反动分子。如果他不能支持他们，那么架在一根动摇的柱子上的建筑物，便会倒塌的。”\n    当我谈到原子炸弹时，毛泽东说：\n    “原子炸弹的产生就是美帝国主义分子死亡的开始，因为他们依靠的只是炸弹。结局却不是炸弹消灭人民，而是人民消灭炸弹的。”\n    我们的谈话结束时，已经是半夜了。\n    第二天早晨我便飞到了北平，而毛泽东搬到更深的山中的窑洞里去了。\n    在华北和满洲的乡村中，充溢着安定的信心，相信人民要坚持到胜利，相信人民的事业，自由和民主的民族的事业，将要成长和发展。\n      译自一九四七年十月十日苏联文学报"

The CCP has dealt with many common problems in Asian countries: land reform, public health, public education, adjusting people's production and needs, awakening people's political and social awareness, self-reliance, etc.\" (See the introduction to the book in the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce's \"Millard's Review\" on November 8th last year).

The more distant future will belong to the party that works for the welfare of the people, so our (referring to the United States) support for anti-communist forces will lead to our own failure.\" (See the translation in Hong Kong's \"Free Essays\" published last August). On January 14th, the Associated Press reported: Two Americans who had been to the Liberated Areas said: After receiving land, \"the farmers are very satisfied. They voluntarily organize militias to defend their newly distributed land.\" and said: The \"morale of soldiers and farmers in the Liberated Areas is strong.\" In December of the year before last, even the reactionary New York Herald Tribune exclaimed: \"The land revolution aimed at implementing land to the tillers is progressing very well in China (Liberated Areas).\" and said: Chiang Kai-shek cannot improve the lives of the vast number of peasants and has developed a tendency to rely on landlords.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美通讯社和报纸也不得不承认  我党土地政策伟大  对亚洲及全世界都有很大意义\n\n1948-02-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    美通讯社和报纸也不得不承认\n    我党土地政策伟大\n    对亚洲及全世界都有很大意义\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】“共产党土地改革纲领吸引着全国千百万农民”，这是美帝半官方通讯社美联社十一日南京电讯中所不得不承认的事实。许多美国自由主义分子亦公认这一政策之伟大：一九四六年访问过延安的美籍记者爱卜斯坦因年前出版“中国未完成的革命”一书，极口赞扬：“中共纲领不仅对于中国，而且对于亚洲，对于全世界都有很大意义。中共处理了亚洲各国共同的许多问题：土地改革、公共卫生、民众教育、调整民众的生产与需要，唤醒人民的政治与社会觉悟、自力更生等。”（见去年十一月八日沪美商密勒士评论报对该书的介绍）前美国驻华大使馆文化专员费正清亦曾著文称：“我们得确定的承认：中共强有力地表现对人民大众福利的关切，它的力量产生于民众对它的支持。至于国民党政权就不能这样说。较远的未来终将属于为人民谋福利的政党，所以我们（指美国）支持反共势力，会自取失败”。（见去年八月香港“自由文丛”译载）上月十四日美联社报导：两个到过解放区的美国人说：分得土地后“农民都很满意。他们自愿组织民兵，保卫他们新分得的土地”。并说：解放区“士兵和农民士气旺盛”。前年十二月，即是反动的美国先驱论坛报亦惊呼：“旨在实行耕者有其田的土地革命，正在中国（解放区）很好的进行”。并说：蒋介石不能使广大农民生活改善，而且发展了依赖地主的倾向。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[This article is] a column:\n\n[By] Our Correspondent\n\n    [This news dispatch] Recently, some working comrades went to Zhao Village, Wu'an, to visit poor peasants and hired laborers to understand the land reform and general work situation in this village. These comrades had been working in government offices for a long time, and during the visiting process, after a period of exploration and experience, they have gained some experience, which is excerpted and disclosed for reference:\n    Initially, these comrades lived in the courtyard of an old activist and got to know some poor peasants and hired laborers. However, these poor peasants and hired laborers did not dare to approach these staff members, fearing that the village cadres would find out and it would be detrimental to them. Subsequently, these staff members dispersed and lived in the homes of poor peasants and hired laborers, eating and sleeping with them, becoming one with them in life and emotion. From unfamiliarity to familiarity, the relationship gradually became closer.\n    At the beginning, four poor peasants and hired laborers were visited, and their land was very bad and far away. The staff, focusing on their urgent demands, first put forward the slogan of \"extracting fertilizer to supplement lean land.\" They were very happy, but still dared not act; they were afraid of the cadres and activists. The fertile land in the village belonged to the cadres and activists, and they still held the power of the village administration. Therefore, they discussed Article 5 of the Land Law Outline: The poor peasant leagues, peasant associations, and peasant representative conferences are the legal executors, and the power to equally distribute land is in the hands of the poor peasants; the cadres will be re-elected by everyone in the future to thoroughly implement democracy. They also read the \"Letter to Peasants\" and \"Letter to Party Members\" from the newspaper. Everyone felt that they had evidence and began to talk about many problems of the cadres, and the situation of being attacked for raising opinions during the \"face washing and wiping black\" [criticism] movement last summer, and quickly connected with fifty or so people.\n    Originally, the target of the connection was people who had worked hard all their lives and suffered, and still had not turned themselves around, but deviations still occurred in the connection. At the beginning, a few middle peasants and hooligans were more active in approaching the staff members. Poor peasants often praised these people for speaking, and these people often vented their grievances, inciting others to oppose the cadres. They said that the cadres had embezzled \"an unknown amount,\" that \"the cadres are all landlords,\" and that \"peaceful solutions are impossible.\" Because they had some private feuds with the cadres, they wanted to take the opportunity to retaliate. A veteran said, \"I have been promoted, and I am willing to let the poor peasant league distribute my land, but I want to avenge the cadres and vent my anger.\" This person had previously united some families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans, making endless demands for care, to distribute more good land and good fruits, and confront and compete with the cadres for benefits, which had a very bad impression among the masses. He spoke more than the masses, with strong sectarian emotions and destructive emotions. The leadership adopted a policy of neither confronting them head-on nor relying on them from the beginning. Not confronting them head-on was to prevent other masses from also becoming afraid and leaving the staff members. But they could not rely on them, so they abandoned them and went directly to the poor peasants and hired laborers.\n    Because they were afraid of being fooled, a sense of frustration of \"not daring to believe anyone\" arose among the staff members. A comrade working in the Third Street found a Jin Yintai. His grandfather was very poor, his father was an old farmhand, and his brother was nearly fifty and had never started a family; he himself had been a farmhand since he was seventeen, and only returned in 1945. There were four people in his family, and they had only had fourteen mu of land in the last two years. His house was dilapidated, obviously a poor peasant. But seeing that he spoke clearly and that he had some grain in his granary, they suspected that he might be a middle peasant or a speculator. When they found Jin Xitai, the situation seemed to be that of a poor peasant, but when they heard that the village cadres had approached him, they were suspicious and dared not approach him; someone said, \"If Fang Jingui enters the poor peasant league, it will be terrible!\" and they suspected that the cadres had instructed him to sabotage. In short, they did not dare to believe anyone who was active, who could speak, or who had a bowl of rice to eat. They regarded the general masses' fear of the cadres as sectarianism.\n    When this batch didn't work, they found some who were both poor and couldn't speak. Some were orphans and widows, and some had epilepsy and were chronically ill, and they felt that they were useless. Later, they found some honest poor people who could work, but they felt that they knew too little about village affairs, could not speak well, were afraid of trouble, and felt that they could not play a backbone role and could not be relied upon.\n    The facts that followed proved that among the honest poor peasants and hired laborers who had worked for many years, some could be active and speak well, and of course they should be relied upon. However, most poor peasants and hired laborers, due to years of exploitation and oppression, had not handled many affairs and were not good at speaking and being active. These people should still be resolutely relied upon. For example, there was a Jin Fuyou in the First Street. His father and he were both poor peasants who reclaimed wasteland, and they were outsiders in Zhao Village. Now there are still five people in the family covering themselves with two quilts. Some poor peasants mentioned him, and the staff wanted to visit him. But he told others in advance that he did not want them to go to his house. A comrade went anyway, but he dared not say anything and left after chatting about some trivial matters. The second time they went again, asked him about his living conditions, and talked to him about the equal distribution of land, extracting fertilizer to supplement lean land, that this time the poor peasants were in charge, not face washing and wiping black (he had raised opinions during the face washing and wiping black movement for the cadres and had been attacked.) In the future, the poor peasants would not only manage the village cadres, but also manage the county and district cadres, etc. He began to have a little hope, and tentatively shook the idea that \"not speaking\" was good. He said, \"The cadres have a lot, because they have merit, and they have a reason to speak; if we want to equally distribute the land, we have no merit and no reason to speak.\" The staff explained to him: The common people's production of grain, service, and burdens are all merits, even greater than the cadres'! His wife interjected, \"We carried stretchers two more times, so the merit is great.\" He said, \"The families of revolutionary martyrs are given more, because they shed blood and sacrificed on the front line. If we want to talk about equal distribution, they will call their people back.\" The staff explained, \"He went out to fight, eating the common people's food; the common people cultivated the land at home on their behalf, is that still not enough for him? Why should he be given more!\" Seeing that the staff had a firm attitude towards the cadres and the families of revolutionary martyrs who had received more fruits, and that they must return them, his emotions were even higher. But then he raised a new question: \"I don't have the materials, I'm not as good at speaking as others, I'm afraid it's still not going to work.\" The staff explained again, \"Being able to farm is having materials, everyone has to rely on farmers to eat.\" He was happy and said, \"Speaking of farming, I alone am worth three of those cadres.\" His emotions became higher and higher, and as he spoke, he went out and found two other poor peasants. From then on, he gradually became active.\n    Jin Chengke in the Third Street always sat in the corner during meetings. His father worked as a farmhand and starved to death, his mother begged for food, and he himself worked as a farmhand for more than twenty years. Later, he reclaimed more than four mu of barren slopes and bought five mu of bad land in a year of disaster. Last year, he still worked short-term for others. When filling in the forms, the cadres said that his family of three had more than nine mu of land, which was enough to cultivate. During the face washing and wiping black movement, he suggested exchanging it for a mu of good land, and the cadres asked him \"what thoughts\" he had, and he quickly declared \"no thoughts, no thoughts.\" Since then, he had been sitting in the corner, never said anything, and paid no attention to anything. This time, after similar visits and mobilization, he also went out and connected with four or five people, becoming a true activist.\n    These experiences prove that firmly and unwaveringly relying on and mobilizing the honest poor peasants and hired laborers whom people looked down upon in the past, believing in them, awakening them, and making them form a backbone with courage and ability is the key to mobilizing the hired and poor peasant class. These people's current leadership ability is not yet skilled enough, and their courage is not yet sufficient, but they are much stronger than they were at the beginning. They actively pay attention to the sabotage activities of bad cadres, investigate the crimes of bad cadres in eliminating traces of embezzlement (accounts) and selling grain and cotton, and mutually advise their own people to correct their mistakes (such as promiscuity), and some demand the organization of new militia to prevent sabotage, actively preparing themselves in all aspects for being in charge in the future.\n    Another important experience gained by the staff in Zhao Village is the combination of individual visits and public propaganda. A few days after the staff visited Zhao Village, they discovered that the village cadres had many sabotage activities. Village Chief Yang Zhankui, after returning from a meeting in the district, convened a meeting of the masses, saying that the village chief of Tian Erzhuang reported that he did not know where a person named Zhang (also a staff member) came from, who arbitrarily lived in Tian Erzhuang without going through the cadres, organized a group of hooligans to implement the Land Law, scaring the middle peasants and disrupting the winter school, and some middle peasants were scared into selling their flocks of sheep (actually, the village chief of Tian Erzhuang himself sold the sheep). Yang Zhankui's intention in saying this was to subtly imply that the staff in Zhao Village were also disrupting the work, and wanted to use this method to threaten the masses. Some bad cadres took the lead in selling grain, promoting \"equal distribution,\" mobilizing middle peasants, creating panic among middle peasants, and also said that it was the staff who scared them. The director of the peasant association summoned the leaders of the peasant association groups and said, \"We confiscated the property of the landlords and distributed the fruits, everyone says there are no accounts!\" Some inquired about news everywhere, went to the homes of the poor peasants visited by the staff to ask questions in return, increasing the concerns of the poor peasants.\n    Seeing this situation, the staff decided to tell the village cadres their intentions in a positive way, and publicly publicize the Land Law in the winter school, to suppress evil spirits and support the poor peasants and hired laborers, so that individual visits would not be disrupted. Honest poor peasants and hired laborers cannot be found through large-scale meetings, because they dare not speak publicly. Without going through the stage of secret visits, reliable backbones cannot be found.\n    At the same time, when conducting in-depth visits to poor peasants and hired laborers, attention was also paid to universally uniting middle peasants. Some streets proposed a combination of universal investigation and individual in-depth visits, holding an investigation meeting of a village or ten or eight families, with middle and poor peasants all attending, conducting small-scale propaganda of the middle peasant policy, and understanding their living conditions, from which they obtained clues as to who was the poorest (some middle peasants also told us a lot about the situation of poor peasants), and then conducted in-depth visits to repeatedly understand the situation. In this way, on the one hand, the panic of the middle peasants was overcome, and on the other hand, the difficulty of some villages not being able to find poor peasants and hired laborers was broken.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 耐心寻找最受压迫的老实人  赵庄深入访问贫雇  个别访问与公开宣传结合，启发阶级自觉，使他们说出知心话。\n\n1948-02-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    耐心寻找最受压迫的老实人\n    赵庄深入访问贫雇\n    个别访问与公开宣传结合，启发阶级自觉，使他们说出知心话。\n    【本报消息】最近有些工作同志到武安赵庄访问贫雇，了解这个村庄土地改革及一般工作情形。这些同志长期作机关工作，在访问过程中，经过一段摸索和体验，已获有一些经验，特摘要披露，以供参考：\n    起初，这些同志住在一个旧积极分子的院里，认识了一些贫雇。但是这些贫雇不敢去找这些工作人员，害怕村干部知道了对自己不利。随后这些工作人员就分散住到贫雇家里，和他们同吃同睡，在生活与感情上打成一片，从不熟识到熟识，关系就慢慢的密切了。\n    一开始访问了四个贫雇，他们的土地都是很坏很远。工作人员针对着他们的迫切要求，首先提出：“抽肥补瘦”的口号。他们非常高兴，但是还不敢动；怕干部、怕积极分子。村里肥的都是干部和积极分子的，他们还掌着村政大权。于是谈土地法大纲第五条：贫农团、农会与农代会是合法执行人，平分土地的大权在贫农手里，干部将来要由大家重新选举，彻底实行民主。又念报纸上的告农民书、告党员书，大家觉得有了凭据，开始说出许多干部的问题，与去年夏天洗脸擦黑时群众提意见受打击的情形，并很快串连了五十来个人。\n    原来说的串连对象是一辈子劳动受苦，至今没翻好身的人，但在串连中仍然出了偏向。开始比较主动和工作人员接近的，有少数中农、二流子，贫农常常推崇这些人说话，这些人常常发泄不平，激发别人反干部。说干部贪污了“不知多少”，“干部都是老财”，“和平解决不了。”…………因为他们和干部有些私仇，想乘机会报复。有一个退伍军人说：“我翻高了，我情愿叫贫农团分了我的地，可是我要报干部的仇，出一出气”。这人过去曾团结一些抗属与荣退军人，无止境的要求照顾，多分好地好果实，和干部对抗、争利，在群众中印象极坏，他说的话比群众多的多，带着浓厚的宗派情绪与破坏情绪。对于这些人，领导上一开始就采取了不硬碰也不依靠的政策。不硬碰是怕使其他群众也害怕起来，离开工作人员。但又不能依靠，于是抛开他们，直接深入到贫雇中去。\n    因为怕上当，在工作人员中曾经产生了“谁也不敢相信”的苦闷。一个同志在第三街工作，找到一个靳银太，他祖父就很穷，父亲是老长工，哥哥年近五十，没成过家；他自己也是从十七岁住长工，到一九四五年才回来。家里四口人，最近两年才有了十四亩地，家里破破烂烂，显然是个贫农。可是看见他说话还清利，囤里还有些粮食，就怀疑他可能是个中农或投机分子。找到靳喜太，看情况也是贫农，可是听说村干部活动过他，就怀疑不敢接近；有人说了一句“方金贵进了贫农团，可不得了，恶哩！”就怀疑是干部授意来破坏。总之，对积极的、会说话的、有了一碗饭吃的，都不敢相信。把一般群众对干部的恐惧也看成了宗派。\n    这批不行，又找着一些又穷又不会说话的。有的是孤儿寡妇，有的是羊羔疯、长年害病的，又觉得他们不顶事。随后找着几个能劳动的穷老实人，又嫌人家对村事知道太少，不会说话，怕是非，觉得起不了骨干作用，靠不上。\n    以后的事实证明：长年劳动的老实贫雇农，其中有些能活动、会说话，当然应该依靠。但大部分贫雇由于多年来被剥削被压迫，处理事情不多，不善于说话和活动，这些人仍然是应该坚决依靠的。例如一街有个靳富有。他父亲和他都是开荒地的贫农，在赵庄是外来户。现在还是一家五口盖着两条被子。有的贫农提到他，工作员想去访问。可是他事前就告诉别人，说他不愿叫去他家。一个同志硬着头去了，但他什么也不敢说，扯了些闲话走了。第二次又去，问了他一些生活情形，给他谈谈平分地土，抽肥补瘦，这次是贫农当家，不是洗脸擦黑（他在给干部洗脸擦黑时提过意见，受过打击。）将来贫农不但要管村干部，还要管县、区干部等，他开始有了点希望，初步动摇了“不说话”好的想法。他说：“人家干部们多得，是人家有功，人家有道理说；咱要平分土地，咱没功，没道理说。”工作员就给他解释：老百姓生产粮食、支差、出负担都是功劳，比干部还大哩！他老婆接口说：“咱抬担架多抬了两回，功劳就是大。”他说：“抗属分的多，人家在前线上流血牺牲哩。咱要说平分，人家就要把人家的人叫回来。”工作员解释：“他出去打仗，吃的老百姓；家里地老百姓代耕，这还对不起他？为啥要多分哩！”他看到工作员对多得果实的干部和多得果实的抗属，都有坚决的态度，一定得退，情绪就更高了些。但又提出新问题：“咱这人没材料，不如人家会说，恐怕总是不行。”工作员又解释：“能种地就是有材料，谁也得靠种地人吃饭。”他高兴了，说：“说种地，我一个人顶那些干部三个人。”他的情绪越来越高，说着说着就出去找来了另外两个贫农，他从此逐渐积极起来。\n    三街有个靳成科，以前开会总是坐在角落里。父亲住长工，饿死了，母亲曾讨饭，他本人住了二十多年长工。后来开了四亩多荒坡，灾荒年又买了五亩坏地，去年还给人家打短工。填补时，干部说他三口人有九亩多地，够种了。他在洗脸擦黑时提出想换亩好地，干部问他“啥思想”，他赶快声明“没思想、没思想。”以后一直坐在角落里，直到现在没说过话，对什么也不闻不问。这次经过类似的访问发动，也出去串连了四、五个人，成为真正的积极分子。\n    这些经验证明：坚决的、不动摇的依靠与发动过去人们看不起的老实贫雇农，相信他们，唤醒他们，使他们形成有勇气、有能力的骨干，就是发动雇贫层的关键。这些人现在的领导能力还不够熟练，勇敢程度还不很够，但比开始时已经强多了。他们积极注意坏干部的破坏活动，调查坏干部消灭贪污痕迹（帐目）和出卖粮食棉花等罪行，互相劝告自己人改正错误（如性生活乱等），有的要求组织新民兵，防止破坏行为，积极从各方面为自己将来当家做准备。\n    工作员在赵庄获得的另一个重要经验，是个别访问与公开宣传相结合。工作员在赵庄访问了几天以后，发现村干部有许多破坏活动。村长杨占魁从区开会回来，召集群众开会，说田二庄村长反映：不知道那儿来了个姓张的（也是个工作员），不经过干部，随便住到田二庄，组织了一伙流氓要实行土地法，把中农吓坏了，冬学也搅得开不成，有些中农吓得卖了羊群（实际是田二庄村长自己卖了羊）。杨占魁说这事的意思是暗指赵庄的工作员也是破坏工作，想用这种方法威胁群众。有的坏干部领头卖粮食，宣传要“大均产”，动中农，造成中农恐慌，又说是工作员吓坏的。农会主任召集农会小组长说：“咱们没收老财东西，分配果实，大家都说没有帐啊！”有的到处打听消息，到工作员访问的贫农家去反问，使贫农增加顾虑。\n    工作员看到这种情况，确定把自己的来意正面告诉村干部，并在冬学中公开的宣传土地法，把邪气打下去，给贫雇撑腰，使个别访问不致受到破坏。老实贫雇以开大会的方式是找不到的，因为他们不敢公开讲话，不经过暗访阶段，绝不能找到可靠的骨干。\n    同时，在深入访问贫雇时，也注意到普遍团结中农。有的街提出普遍调查与个别深入访问结合，开一个闾或十来八家的调查会，中贫农都来，小型的宣传中农政策，了解他们的生活情况，从中获得谁家最穷的线索（中农有的也告诉我们不少贫农情况），然后深入访问，反复了解情况。这样一方面克服了中农的恐慌，另方面也打破了某些闾找不到贫雇的困难。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Moscow Dispatch: The CPC Central Committee has recently announced a decision regarding the opera \"The Great Friendship,\" sharply criticizing the erroneous tendencies in Soviet musical circles, namely, formalistic, affected, anti-popular tendencies, and the tendency to surrender to the decadent and dying music of the European and American bourgeoisie. The decision first points out: The opera \"The Great Friendship,\" composed by Muradeli based on poems by Mdivani, is an unrealistic and non-artistic work, both in terms of music and theme. The music of the opera is dry, clumsy, chaotic, and unharmonious, merely an endless noise, a combination of ear-splitting sounds, without a single captivating melody or atmosphere. The plot of the opera is also affected and contrived. The decision continues: \"The case of the Muradeli opera proves that its failure is not an isolated phenomenon, but is closely linked to the formalistic tendencies that are spreading among Soviet composers. Muradeli is merely one person who has embarked on this unfortunate path.\" The decision recalls: \"As early as 1936, when Shostakovich's opera, 'Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District,' was released, such anti-popular and formalistic bad tendencies in Soviet musical circles were sharply criticized, and the dangers of developing Soviet music in this direction were exposed. The CPC Central Committee believes that Soviet music has not yet been transformed. The individual successes of Soviet composers in creating new songs that are appreciated and widely disseminated by the people, and in film scoring, etc., cannot change this overall picture. The erroneous and anti-democratic formalistic tendencies in music, which deviate from the Soviet people and their artistic tastes, are particularly evident in the works of composers such as Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Khachaturian, Shebalin, and Miaskovsky. The typical characteristics of these musics are the negation of the basic principles of classical music, the dissemination of noise and disharmony, supposedly representing the \"progress\" and \"new trends\" in the development of musical form. This music exudes the strong stench of so-called \"modernist\" bourgeois culture, reflecting the decadence of bourgeois culture and the complete negation of European and American music art. The situation is particularly bad in symphonic and operatic art. Many Soviet composers despise the finest traditions of Russian and Western classical music, rejecting these traditions, considering them \"outdated,\" \"old-fashioned,\" and \"conservative,\" and mocking those composers who consciously want to master and develop the methods of classical music. In this way, they divorced their music from the demands and artistic tastes of the Soviet people. They depreciate the high social role of music, limiting the meaning of music to catering to the degenerate whims of individual figures who masquerade as great artists. The pernicious influence of erroneous and anti-popular tendencies in Soviet music has also affected the training and education of young composers in national music schools. First and foremost, at the Moscow State Conservatory, where Shebalin is the president, formalistic tendencies are dominant. The CPC Central Committee calls everyone's attention to the intolerable situation in Soviet music criticism, which no longer reflects the opinions of the people, but has become the mouthpiece of individual composers. The CPC Central Committee believes that the erroneous policies pursued by the State Arts Committee and the Organizing Committee of the Soviet Composers' Union have created this unsatisfactory situation in Soviet musical circles. They have not strived to cultivate realistic tendencies in Soviet music, which are based on accepting and further developing the classical heritage, especially the traditions of the Russian music school, combining lofty content with the artistic integrity of musical form, and deeply and organically linking music with the people and their creative art in music and songs. In short, they are encouraging formalistic tendencies that deviate from the people. The CPC Central Committee believes that this situation in Soviet musical circles, and this attitude towards Soviet music, can no longer be tolerated. The decision finally calls on composers in the Soviet Union, who have unlimited creative opportunities, to rise up and realize the high demands that the Soviet people place on musical art.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 联共中央公布  关于苏联音乐艺术决定  严厉批评形式主义反大众化的倾向\n\n1948-02-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    联共中央公布\n    关于苏联音乐艺术决定\n    严厉批评形式主义反大众化的倾向\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科讯：联共中央顷公布关于歌剧“伟大的友情”的决定，严厉批评了苏联音乐界错误的倾向，即形式主义的、娇揉做作的、反大众化的、向欧美资产阶级没落垂死的音乐投降的倾向。决定首先指出：作曲家莫拉德里根据姆德万所作的诗歌谱成的歌剧，“伟大的友情”，不论从音乐或主题方面来看，都是不真实的、非艺术的作品，歌剧的音乐枯燥拙劣，杂乱无章，毫不和谐，只是一些无休止的噪音，一些刺耳的音响的组合，其中没有一点使人神往的旋律或气氛。歌剧的情节也同样是娇揉做作的。决定继指出：“苏联音乐界代表会证明了：莫拉德里歌剧的失败，并不是孤立的现象，而是和散布在苏联作曲家中的形式主义倾向密切结合着的，莫拉德里仅是走上了这种不幸道路之一人。”决定回溯称：“早在一九三六年，当萧斯塔可维奇所作的歌剧，“墨森斯克的马克白斯夫人”问世时，苏联音乐界这种反大众化的、形式主义的恶劣倾向就曾受到尖锐的批评，并且被揭露了以这一方向来发展苏联音乐所存在的危险。联共中央认为苏维埃音乐迄未改造。苏联作曲家在创作为人民欣赏而且传布甚广的新歌方面，在电影配曲方面等的个别成功，并不能改变这种总的面貌。背离苏维埃人民及其艺术口味的音乐上形式主义的恶劣倾向与反民主倾向，特别明显地表现在萧斯塔可维奇，普罗可菲也夫，哈加杜里阳，谢巴林，密斯托夫斯基等作曲家的作品中。这些音乐的典型特点，就是否定古典音乐的基本原则，传布噪音和不和谐，据说这是代表音乐形式发展中的“进步”和“新趋势”的表现。这种音乐发散着所谓“现代派”资产阶级文化的强烈臭气，发散着反映资产阶级文化的没落，以及完全否定音乐艺术的欧美音乐的强烈臭气。在交响乐和歌剧艺术方面，情形尤其坏。许多苏联作曲家藐视俄罗斯和西方古典音乐中最优秀的传统，拒绝这些传统，认之为“陈腐”，“旧式”和“保守”，嘲笑那些自觉的想精通和发展古典音乐的方法的作曲家。他们就这样把他们的音乐和苏维埃人民的要求和艺术口味分了家了。他们贬抑音乐的高度社会作用，把音乐的意义局限在迎合那些冒充伟大艺术家的个别人物堕落的兴头上。苏联音乐中的谬误的、反大众化的倾向的流毒，也影响到国立音乐学校中青年作曲家的训练和教育。首先便在莫斯科国立音乐院，谢巴林就是那里的院长，形式主义倾向在那里占着统治地位。联共中央唤醒大家注意苏联音乐批评界中不可容忍的情形，苏联音乐批评界已不再反映人民的意见，而成为个别作曲家的喉舌了。联共中央认为国家艺术委员会与苏联作曲家协会组织委员会，所奉行的错误政策，造成了苏联音乐界这一不能令人满意的情形，他们不是在苏联音乐中努力培养现实主义的倾向，这种现实主义倾向所依据的基础就是：接受和进一步发展古典遗产，特别是俄罗斯音乐学派的传统，把崇高的内容和音乐形式的艺术完整性相结合，把音乐和人民及其在音乐和歌曲中的创造性艺术深刻有机地联系起来。总之：他们鼓励着背离人民的形式主义倾向。联共中央认为对于苏联音乐界的这种情形，和这种对待苏联音乐的态度，已不能再事容忍。决定最后号召在苏联具有无限创作机会的作曲家们，奋起实现苏联人民对音乐艺术所提出的高度要求。"

    "date": "1948-02-19",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "The following experiences were put forward by Huolu County in connecting and mobilizing the poor and hired peasants:\n\n    I. First, there must be a determination to find and employ poor peasants. This is a test of every comrade's class viewpoint. At mass meetings, the cadres' covenant was read out: Eat the food of the poor and hired peasants, live in the houses of the poor and hired peasants. When we first arrived at the homes of poor and hired peasants, they worried that we would dislike their dilapidated houses, bad food, and the fact that they were too poor to even have a place to sit. But after we explained, \"Where you sleep, we will sleep. What you eat, we will eat.\" County Chief Zhang Xiangnan went to Fangtai to visit a poor and hired peasant. The family felt that since the county chief had arrived, they quickly borrowed a small stool from someone else, but the county chief just sat down on the ground, without using the stool. Liang Lantian went to Gaoqian Village to visit a poor and hired peasant. There was some manure in his house, and he was afraid we would think it was dirty, so he tried to sit on the manure to block it, but Comrade Lantian saw through this and sat next to him. Once, while eating in Nan Ganzi, the masses and us were eating two different kinds of food. Comrade Wei Shanqi of the County Party Committee put aside the rice and flour cakes and grabbed the masses' black flour residue cake to eat, saying, \"A family doesn't eat two different kinds of food.\" Eating and sleeping in the homes of the poor and hired peasants like this was a support for the poor and hired peasants, restricted the destructive activities of the landlords, and established a close relationship with the poor and hired peasants. The poor and hired peasants cared for us very much, afraid that we would be cold, and asked us to eat on the kang.\n\n    II. Solving the actual difficulties in the lives of the poor and hired peasants: The lives of the poor and hired peasant masses in the new district are very difficult. Some poor and hired peasants don't have anything to eat right now and can't wait. Some first confiscated a few households to solve the current living problems of the poor and hired peasants, and the enthusiasm for the struggle became greater. In addition, it is also necessary to promptly solve various difficulties of the poor and hired peasants: County Chief Zhang went to Wei Xizi's home in Fangtai. His family of three was covering themselves with a torn quilt, and his mother was afraid that we would see it and be embarrassed, so she tightly covered it with a torn cloth bag. After County Chief Zhang discovered this, he temporarily borrowed two quilts for him from the village. The old lady was very grateful and told everyone she met, becoming a good propagandist for us.\n\n    III. Care for everyone in the families of the poor and hired peasants. When we arrive at the homes of the poor and hired peasants, we cannot immediately make political demands, and immediately ask how many houses? How many acres of land? How many people? Who is good and who is bad in your village? You deserve to be rebuffed if you do that. We should first become a family in terms of thoughts and emotions. If we see a sick person, we should ask what is wrong? How long has it been? Hurry up and ask a doctor to treat it! If you see a child, you can hug them and ask if they are cold. Our sincere love and care for everyone in the families of the poor and hired peasants easily turns us into a family in terms of thoughts and emotions, making them feel like we are really a family, and it becomes convenient to talk about problems. Before the masses thoroughly understand you, don't say anything or look around when you see young women in the family. After a long time, they will take the initiative to approach us.\n\n    IV. Using suffering to elicit suffering, introducing our own experiences: After Comrade Wang Xiuhai introduced his suffering of begging for two years and herding sheep for fifteen years, the poor and hired peasants said: \"Comrade Wang is so similar to us! He is also a poor person.\" After that, many poor and hired peasants automatically went to Comrade Wang Xiuhai to complain. After Li Fengying of Nan Ganzi complained in the poor and hired peasant group, cadre Wang Xinjin complained about the tragic situation of his entire family of six dying of starvation and being scattered. The whole group cried. At this time, everyone was vying to tell their own suffering.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 获鹿访贫雇经验\n魏善琦  孙成文\n1948-02-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    获鹿访贫雇经验\n    魏善琦  孙成文\n    获鹿县在串通发动贫雇中提出了以下的经验：\n    一、首先要有找雇贫的决心，这是每个同志阶级观点的考验。在群众会上宣读了干部公约：吃贫雇的饭，住贫雇的房。我们开始一到贫雇家，他顾虑我们嫌房子破，吃的坏，家里穷连个坐的地方也没。但经我们说明：“你睡在那里，俺睡在那里。你吃啥饭，俺也吃啥饭。”县长张香楠在方台去访问贫雇，该户觉着县长到了，赶快到别人家借了个小板凳，县长就一屁股坐在地下，没有坐凳子。梁兰田在高迁村去访贫雇，他家里有些粪，怕我们嫌脏，想坐在粪上把它挡住，兰田同志看透这步，就和他并坐了。一次在南甘子吃饭，群众和我们吃的两样饭，县委魏善琦同志放着米面饼子不吃，上前抓住群众的黑粉渣饼子吃，并说：“一家人不吃两样饭。”这样分散在贫雇家里吃饭睡觉，对贫雇是个撑腰，限制了地主的破坏活动，与贫雇建立了密切的感情。贫雇对我们非常爱护，怕冻着我们，叫我们到炕上吃饭。\n    二、给贫雇解决生活上的实际困难：新区贫雇群众的生活非常困难，有些贫雇因现在就没吃的，等不上。有的首先没收了几户，解决了贫雇户当前的生活问题，斗争的劲头就大了。此外还要及时解决贫雇的各种困难：张县长到方台魏喜子家，他家三人伙盖着一条破被子，他娘怕看见嫌丢人，紧用破布袋盖。张县长发觉后，给他从村里暂借了二条被子，这个老太太非常感谢，见人就说，见人就讲，成了我们很好的宣传员。\n    三、关心贫雇家里的一切人，我们到了贫雇家里，不能一开始就提出政治要求，开口就问几间房子？几亩地？几口人？你村谁好谁坏？这样活该你碰钉子。应首先从思想情绪上变为一家，看见病人就问什么病？多长时间了？赶快请医生治治吧！见了小孩就可以抱抱，问他冷吗？我们对贫雇家里的一切人真诚的爱护与关心，很容易与贫雇在思想情绪上变为一家，使他感到真是一家人，说问题就方便了。在群众未彻底了解你之前，到家里见了年青女人，千万别说话，也不要乱看，时间长了他就会主动的接近我们。\n    四、以苦引苦，介绍我们本身的事：王修海同志介绍了自己讨饭二年，放羊十五年的苦后，贫雇说：“王同志这样沾！也是个穷人，以后许多贫雇就自动去找王修海同志诉苦。南甘子李凤英在贫雇组诉苦后，干部王新金把自己全家六口人饿死失散的惨状诉苦了一遍，全组哭起来，这时大家都争着把自己的苦诉出来了。"

    "content": "Transmitted by the Cooperation Department, Comrade Lei Yun of the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee inquired about livestock diseases. We gathered Chinese and Western veterinary doctors for detailed discussions and decided on some suggestions. Similar diseases have also occurred in other places, and these suggestions can be used for reference in prevention and treatment.\n\nComrade Lei Yun's letter did not provide enough detail about the symptoms, so we could only discuss the situation based on what he mentioned with Chinese and Western veterinary doctors. According to the Chinese medicine diagnosis, it is jaundice, belonging to one of the malignant jaundice types, visceral jaundice. Western medicine diagnoses it as anthrax. They are described separately below:\n\nA. Chinese medicine's perspective on the cause, symptoms, treatment, and prevention of jaundice:\n\nIt is said that there are many types of jaundice, a total of thirty-six, including twelve malignant jaundice types (divided into external jaundice and internal jaundice). Visceral jaundice, also called internal jaundice, is one of the most severe types of jaundice because it occurs in the internal organs and has no obvious external signs. It is not easily detected by ordinary people in time. By the time it is detected, it is already impossible to treat. If it can be detected early, there are still some ways to treat it, but if it is too late, it will only lead to death because the internal organs are already damaged, so there is no way to save it. Visceral jaundice is further divided into six types: heart jaundice, liver jaundice, lung jaundice, kidney jaundice, spleen jaundice, and slow intestinal jaundice, described as follows:\n\nI. Cause: Due to dry weather, untimely or insufficient drinking water, and excessive feeding, the feed toxins accumulate in the triple energizer, excessive accumulation of heat, transmitted to the five internal organs, resulting in malignant jaundice.\n\nII. Symptoms:\n(1) Heart Jaundice: Bites itself or bites people, tongue color is as red as cinnabar, pulse is rapid and strong.\n(2) Liver Jaundice: Mouth and tongue turn cyanotic, head droops, ears droop, eyes are closed and dull.\n(3) Lung Jaundice: Mouth color is as white as dry bone, rapid and coarse breathing (noisy breathing).\n(4) Kidney Jaundice: Mouth color is as black as ink, lower back and hips are painful, urination is dripping.\n(5) Spleen Jaundice: Mouth color is like yellow soil, spleen fire is too strong, persistent diarrhea.\n(6) Slow Intestinal Jaundice: Mouth and tongue are white and dull, lack of energy, ears droop, head droops, nasal discharge is yellow pus, smells like fecal slurry.\n\nIII. Treatment: Use 2 taels of Sichuan Zhongji, ½ tael of alum, grind into fine powder, then use boar bile (one) mixed with well flower water (freshly drawn cold water) to drench.\n\nIV. Prevention:\n(1) Bloodletting in spring and autumn can prevent the occurrence of various jaundice types.\n(2) Do not feed leftover grass or feed, provide water on time, do not feed too much, and rest on time, which can also prevent it.\n\nB. Western medicine calls this disease Anthrax, which is a hot, acute infectious disease.\n\nI. Cause: Due to infection with Bacillus anthracis. This bacteria can produce spores and has strong resistance. It must be dry heated to 130 degrees Celsius for three to five minutes to kill it. It is transmitted into the animal's body through food, breathing, and skin cracks, or through a blood-sucking insect vector.\n\nII. Symptoms: The incubation period is about one to ten days. It is most likely to stay and multiply in the blood vessels of the throat, causing serous edema mixed with gelatinous substances. The lymph nodes are also red and swollen, and the spleen is enlarged several times. The blood does not clot and is black. The bacteria multiply in the blood vessels, often blocking the blood vessels, obstructing the circulatory system, and preventing blood from flowing. The bacteria undergo changes in the intestines, causing the intestinal lymph nodes to also turn red and develop serous edema. The body temperature is above 40 degrees Celsius, breathing is rapid and forced, and blood is often discharged in the urine and feces. The muscles of the whole body are stiff, and at first there is severe abdominal pain.\n\nIII. Course:\n(1) Most Acute: Dies within a few hours of onset.\n(2) Acute: Dies within two or three days of onset.\n(3) Chronic: Stands unwilling to move, dull, pupils dilated, pulse weak, breathing increased and difficult, mucous membranes appear blue-red, with bleeding spots, bowel movements initially constipated and then diarrhea, body is edematous, dies in seven or eight days, sometimes there are recoveries.\n\nIV. Prognosis: Does not eat.\n\nV. Autopsy: Non-clotting blood flows out of natural orifices. Blood does not clot after death. There are bleeding spots under the skin when peeling the skin. The spleen is enlarged several times, also with bleeding spots, and is weak or rotten. Blood examination during the onset of the disease shows Bacillus anthracis (under a microscope), which can be transmitted to humans.\n\nVI. Treatment: This disease is difficult to treat. After discovery, strictly isolate it from healthy livestock. Inject anthrax serum (intravenously or subcutaneously), or intravenously inject 606. For horses and cattle, 2.7 grams each time, and small horses and cattle are reduced according to age. Orally administer 10 cc of Lysol, mixed with water, to disinfect the intestines and stomach. Use a 5% aqueous solution of carbolic acid, 50 cc, for daily internal use. For those with poor spirits, give cardiotonic stimulants.\n\nVII. Disposal and Prevention: Anthrax is the most severe infectious disease. Once infected, it mostly leads to death. Therefore, the carcasses of animals that die from anthrax must be burned. The equipment used for sick animals should be disinfected and cleaned with lime water. The stable should be fully disinfected, and carcasses should not be eaten. Remove one foot of soil from the floor of the stable and burn it with grass to completely eliminate the bacteria and avoid future troubles. After anthrax-infected livestock is discovered, neighboring animals should be injected with anthrax serum for prevention. Sick animals must not be moved or sold arbitrarily. The discovery of anthrax should be reported to the government or notified to neighboring areas for effective prevention.\n\n@① Original character fire plus 扎 right side\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 骡马脏黄病\n北大农学院兽医院\n1948-02-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    骡马脏黄病\n    顷由合作厅转来冀南三地委会雷云同志问牲口病的信，我们集中了中西兽医详加讨论，决定了一些意见，别的地方也有同样的病发生，这些意见可作参考，设法预防治疗。\n    雷云同志来信中，对于病状谈的不够详细，我们也只有按他所谈的情况，和中西兽医研讨了一下。按中医的判断是黄症，属于十二恶黄中脏黄的一种；西医判断为炭疽病。现分别写在后面：甲、中医对于黄症的病原病状治疗和预防：\n    据说黄的种类很多，共有三十六种，内有十二恶黄（分外黄、内黄二类），脏黄也叫内黄，是黄症中最厉害的几种，因为发生在内脏，外表无显著象征，一般人不容易即时发觉；及至发觉的时候，已经无法救治了。倘若能即早察觉，还有一些医治的办法，迟了就只有任其死亡。因为内脏已经坏了，所以无法救治。脏黄又分心黄、肝黄、肺黄、肾黄、脾黄及慢肠黄六种，分述于后：\n    一、病原  由于天气干燥，饮水失时或不足，而又喂料太多，料毒积于三焦，积热太甚，传于五脏，致成恶黄。\n    二、病状  （一）心黄  自咬其身或咬人，舌色红如珠砂，脉数洪大。\n    （二）肝黄  口舌发青，头低耳搭，眼闭无光。\n    （三）肺黄  口色白如枯骨，气促喘粗（出气带声）。\n    （四）肾黄  口色黑如台＠①，腰胯疼痛，小便淋漓。\n    （五）脾黄  口色如黄土，脾火太盛，泄泻不止。\n    （六）慢肠黄  口舌白色无光，精神短少，耳搭头低，鼻流黄脓，臭如粪浆。\n    三、治  法  用川中吉二两，白矾半两，共为细末，另用公猪胆汁（一个）和井花水（新汲冷水）调灌。\n    四、预防法  （一）在春秋两季放大血，可预防各种黄症发生。\n      （二）勿喂剩草剩料，按时饮水，喂料不可太多，按时休息，亦可预防。乙、西医称此病为炭疽，是热性急性传染病。\n    一、原因  由于炭疽杆菌之传染，该菌能生芽胞，抵抗力强大，摄氏一百三十度干热、须三分至五分钟方可杀死。由于饮食物呼吸及皮肤裂处，传染入动物体内，或由一种吮血虫之媒介传染之。\n    二、症候  潜伏期约一日至十日，在喉部血管中最易停留而繁殖，发生浆液性水肿，夹有精胶状物质，淋巴腺亦发红肿，脾脏肿大数倍，血液不凝结而黑色，病菌在血管中生孳繁殖，常将血管闭塞，循环器受阻碍，血液不得流通，病菌在肠中发生变态，使肠淋巴腺亦发红而生浆液性水肿，体温在摄氏四十度以上，呼吸速迫，大小便常有血液排出，全身肌肉发硬，起初有发剧烈之腹痛者。\n    三、经过（一）最急性  发病后数小时倒毙。（二）急性  发病后二三日倒毙。（三）慢性  站立不愿走动，沉闷，瞳孔散大，脉搏微弱，呼吸增加而困难，露出粘膜呈蓝红色，有出血斑点，大便初秘结而后泻，体态浮肿，七八日而倒毙，间有痊愈者。\n    四、预候  不吃。\n    五、尸体解剖  天然孔流出不凝固之血液，死后血液也不凝固，剥皮时皮下有出血斑点，脾脏肿大数倍，亦有出血斑点，且柔弱或腐烂，发病时检查血液内有炭疽杆菌（显微镜下），能传染给人。\n    六、疗法  此病治疗困难，发现后与健畜严行隔离，注射炭疽血清（静脉或皮下），或静脉注射六○六，马牛每次二、七格兰姆，小马牛依年龄而递减，内服来苏儿十西西，混水与之，消毒肠胃，用石炭酸百分之五，水溶液五十西西，每日内服。精神不振者，给以强心兴奋药。\n    七、处置及预防  炭疽为最剧烈之传染病，一经传染，多归死亡。故凡因炭疽而死亡之尸体，必须烧掉，病畜用具，以石灰水消毒、清洗。马房内应充分消毒，尸体不可食用。马房之地，去土一尺，用草烧之，以期完全烧除病菌，免遗后患。发现炭疽病畜后，其邻近之兽类，宜注射炭疽血清，以资预防。病畜不得任意移动买卖，发现炭疽，应呈报政府，或通知邻接地区，作有效之预防。\n      ＠①原字火加扎右"

The Jinan People's Liberation Army recaptured the strategic point of Yuncheng and Jiexian city for the second time on the 7th. The Chiang bandit 30th Division, which defended Yuncheng, abandoned the city and fled under the siege of our army and people. The railway between Lingshi and Linfen on the Tongpu Railway is still under the control of the People's Liberation Army. The Yan bandit 66th Division, which sneaked into the isolated city of Linfen, is panic-stricken under the attacks and encirclement of our local armed forces and militiamen. After the great victory in Liaoyang, the Northeast People's Liberation Army continued to carry out sweeping operations around Shenyang. In the past ten days (February 7th to 16th), in Shahebao in southern Shenyang, Shifosi in northern Shenyang, and Masanjiazi in western Shenyang, a total of more than 4,900 enemies were annihilated, including units of the 52nd Army, New 6th Army, New 1st Army, and New 3rd Army, and more than ten strongholds and stations such as Shahebao and Xinglongdian were captured.

The local armed forces of the Third Sub-district routed more than 700 bandits and diehards near Luanchuan, killing and capturing more than 50. The local armed forces of Songxian, in coordination with farmers from 15 villages, suppressed the armed rebellion of reactionary landlords, and seized more than 180 guns hidden by the landlords, and organized hundreds of militiamen. A unit of our main force in the Sixth Sub-district of Yuwansu attacked the enemy at Xiejiaqiao in eastern Fuyang on the 8th, annihilating more than 120 enemies. On the 12th, another unit of our army shot down an enemy plane near Qixian, and the fuselage was destroyed. In the Jiaodong area, the local armed forces outside Yantai took the initiative to attack the enemy and crack down on grain-grabbing bandits and puppets in January, fighting 66 battles, killing and wounding 470 enemies, capturing 120 alive, and killing, wounding, and capturing 164 \"Homecoming Legions.\" Our army also surrounded the enemy occupying Longkou from the east, south, and west. The Northwest People's Liberation Army has achieved great results in its winter training.\n\n　　During the Lunar New Year, the people in the newly liberated areas of Xuchang, Baofeng, Yexian and other places on the southern front celebrated the first Lunar New Year after liberation. The masses universally and enthusiastically launched a movement to support the army. The People's Liberation Army and local armed forces in various places also universally inspected the relationship between the army and the people and helped the masses with land reform and other work, further strengthening the relationship between the army and the people.

    "content": "A Lifetime of a Hired Laborer Talks of Hardships\n— A Short Biography of Hired Laborer Jia Zhengfang\n\n    My name is Jia Zhengfang, and I live in Hexi Village, Wu'an County. When my father was alive, there were six people in our family (my four brothers and my parents). We never had enough to eat, and we didn't own an inch of land. My father barely managed to support the family by working as a carpenter. My mother died when I was twelve. Seeing that these children of mine were uncared for and life was difficult, my father died in a fit of worry after only fifty days! He left behind four children. My brother Jia Deming was only six years old and was adopted by my uncle. My uncle introduced my eldest brother to work at a brick kiln, my second brother cooked for a wealthy family, and I herded cattle for a wealthy family. They only gave me food and no wages. Later, they found a woman to cook, and this woman had a child who could herd cattle, so they didn't need me anymore. At thirteen, I went to Sanwang Village to herd cattle, herding for several families. I lived in the house of the landlord Li Nianxi. After three years, they only gave me a little over eight strings of cash. One day, when I was herding cattle, I don't know how, but one of Li the landlord's cows went lame. His wife said that I had beaten it lame and didn't want me to herd cattle anymore. At the end of the year, when settling accounts, the landlord's wife said, \"He eats our cooked food and earns us raw money (meaning cash), and he even beat his cow-daddy lame. Where is his conscience?\" I ate what I suffered for, and I earned what I suffered for, and she still called the cow my father. Landlords are so mean! I went back home. I was sixteen at this time and herded sheep for a landlord in Shidong for a year. At seventeen, I became a long-term laborer at the house of Lao Ruizi in Hexi (a big landlord in Hexi). I lived there for five years, and I endured their exploitation and meanness. The landlord drank thick gruel and ate sesame candy early in the morning. At noon, it was either mianjin (gluten) or pork hock, or noodles. Every day was different. We poor people ate two meals of thin rice gruel a day, drinking clear rice water all year round, eating pickled vegetables. We didn't even drink rice water with beans in it. We only ate white flour four times a year (May Dragon Boat Festival, June 6th, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Autumn Harvest). Besides that, we ate it once when the wheat was harvested. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, they would give us a little hat-head meat (a few slices of meat on top of the vegetables). In the winter, we got up early (before dawn) to work in the fields, eating a little thin rice gruel, while the landlord lay on the kang (heated brick bed), warming himself by the fire, drinking wine and eating meat dishes. The landlord wanted chives with his pork hock, and the chives were only an inch high, but he wanted them, so we would go to the garden and cut them. When I ate thin rice gruel, I had no vegetables to eat with it, so I would pick a few scallions (a handful) from the garden to eat with it. When the landlord saw it, he would scold, \"They're only that big, and you already want to eat them,\" saying that I shouldn't eat them. I ate two meals, while the landlord ate four (early morning, noon, dusk, and night).\n    In the winter, the landlord covered himself with a fine silk quilt, wide and thick, while I was given a thin and narrow one that wouldn't even cover my body. Early in the morning, the landlord would light a coal fire. When it got cold in October, I would find some firewood to warm myself, and the landlord would say it wasn't cold and that burning the firewood was wasting his wood. As for clothes, the landlord wore a small cotton-padded jacket inside, a large cotton-padded jacket, and then a fur coat on top. He wore cotton socks, felt socks, and cotton shoes on his feet and warmed himself by the fire. The socks I wore revealed my feet, and I had only a thin, tattered cotton-padded jacket. It was so cold in the early morning that I would secretly warm myself in the \"lower place\" (where we laborers lived). When the landlord saw it, he would say, \"Hmph, I told you to work early in the morning. Did I tell you to warm yourself by the fire?\"\n    The landlord lived in a spacious house, while I lived in the \"lower place\" with the livestock. Even on rainy days, I couldn't rest. I would strip hemp and mend saddlebags in the \"lower place.\" Once, on a rainy day, I was stripping hemp in the room, and a broken mule was standing in the yard. When the landlord saw it, he said meanly, \"Hmph, people know to shelter in the house, but I have to leave my mule in the rain!\" Also, in the spring, another long-term laborer and I were carrying soil to reinforce the embankment. If we didn't fill the baskets completely, he would say, \"Hey! You two can't even fill the baskets.\" If we filled them completely and the carrying pole broke, he would say that we broke his pole that hadn't broken in years. My shoulders were sore from carrying the heavy loads, but he didn't care. He only cared about his things breaking. The old miser valued his things more than he valued us laborers. Once, I was working in the threshing ground, and I left the broom on the ground. When he saw it, he scolded me again, \"Hey! You never forget to eat, but you can't remember to pick up your things.\"\n    In the hot weather, I was hoeing the fields. It was too hot, so I rested under a tree to cool off. The landlord came and said, \"Hey! Is it that hot today! You can't rest there (referring to the field)? You have to come here (referring to under the tree).\" He was afraid that I wasn't working enough. Alas, in those years, the landlord could say whatever he wanted. If he said it wasn't hot, I wouldn't dare to say it was hot. If he said it wasn't cold, I wouldn't dare to say it was cold. Anyway, we could only listen. I could write chapters and chapters about the meanness of the landlords I suffered under!\n    After living as a long-term laborer for five years, at the age of twenty-two, I had some strength and energy. My brother didn't want me to be a long-term laborer anymore and took me to a brick kiln. At the kiln, I worked from dawn till dusk, handling mud and water all day long. My hands cracked. During the New Year, everyone else went home, but I stayed at the kiln. I continued to fire bricks until I was twenty-eight, accumulating some savings. I spent two hundred and twenty silver dollars to marry a wife. I couldn't even support my family by working odd jobs, so I rented six mu of land from Zhang Xilin to farm. I lost countless work opportunities and converted five mu of dry land into a garden for someone. I had to pay five dou of grain per mu, and three shi of grain a year, plus two sheng of wheat. In the fifth lunar month of the twenty-eighth year, my wife fell ill. In the seventh month, I also fell ill. I had planted the land, but neither of us could tend to it. I told the landlord to tend it himself. At this time, I still owed him three shi of grain. As a result, he harvested everything in the field and said it wasn't enough. He wanted me to pay him until the third month of the following year. I hadn't harvested any grain, but I still had to pay him. This is how landlords exploited us. That winter, after we recovered from our illnesses, we had nothing left at home, so we sold all our furniture, but it still wasn't enough to live on. I gave my little girl away to Nancongjing. My wife begged for food, but she couldn't feed three people (I had a son). There was no way. My wife saw that we couldn't survive at home and didn't want to beg for food, so she left, abandoning me and my child. In the thirtieth year, I farmed nine mu of poor land from Lao Ruizi that didn't measure up. I paid four dou of rent per mu. It was a bad year, and the nine mu of land didn't even yield three shi of grain. It only yielded two shi and six dou, but he still wanted me to pay three shi and six dou of rent. He took all two shi and six dou of grain away, leaving nothing for us. He even said, \"Zhengfang, you still owe me one shi of grain!\" I had nothing left at home, so I carried my child on my back and went to the enemy-occupied area (the area occupied by the Japanese) to work at a kiln. I earned twenty or thirty Japanese yen and exchanged it for forty or fifty yuan of Jicha, planning to buy some grain to feed my family when I returned. As soon as I returned, Lao Ruizi demanded that one shi of grain. I said I would work for others next year to pay it off, but he refused. He took me to the district office in Zhaozhuang. The district office spoke to the landlord, saying that my rent was to pay public grain. If the public grain could wait until next year, then I could pay next year. Otherwise, I had to pay this year. The landlord converted it into money for five dou and five sheng of rice. The two hundred strings of cash that I had worked so hard to earn at the kiln were immediately taken away by Lao Ruizi for one hundred and thirty strings. I didn't even have enough to buy grain! In the thirty-first year, I worked odd jobs again. During the famine year (thirty-second year), on the fourteenth day of the first month, some families ate pork hock for the Lantern Festival. My child saw someone selling mixed noodles and asked me to buy some. I didn't have any money, so I went to borrow money from my brother. I didn't get any. After much pleading, my brother borrowed me a catty of millet. I ate that catty of millet for half a month, eating sparingly. I ate a lot of rapeseed cake, sesame cake, and radish greens, which made my body swell. Once, my child was so hungry that he was in a terrible state. He ate some turnips from a neighbor's field. The neighbor came and got angry, hitting my child. I didn't mean to beat my child to death. My child was already starving and couldn't go on. I didn't expect that one blow would kill him. Since then, whenever I see other people's children, my heart feels ice-cold. If my child were still alive, he would be fourteen years old now. Now, I don't have a single child!\n    I suffered my whole life, from the age of twelve until the year before last. After I started a family, I didn't have a house, so I lived in a temple. I didn't have anything to cover myself with, so I picked up some torn burlap sacks and rotten felt outside. I sewed them together and used them as a blanket. I suffered for so many years, but in the end, my wife left, my child died, and I was left as a bachelor. During the autumn harvest of the thirty-fifth year, I heard people say that the village cadres said I was a bachelor and no one would support me, so they rated my fruit output as third class (only four or five points). When they were distributing things to us, one cadre said, \"Give him good stuff so he can marry a wife? He's a bachelor. Don't give him good stuff. Just give him a piece of clothing.\" I took a cloth roll and opened it. It was three pieces of children's foreign cloth. It didn't matter that they didn't give me anything, but when I saw the children's clothes, I thought of my child. If my child were still alive, I could have made clothes for him. My child is gone, and I'm forty-six years old. Whenever I think of it, my heart feels ice-cold (he cried). I've never gambled or smoked opium in my life. All I know how to do is suffer for others (working as a short-term laborer, long-term laborer, and at the kiln). I don't know how to do sneaky work (doing business). I've worked hard my whole life, without eating or drinking extravagantly, without being dishonest. The village only allocated me one mu of land and some broken things. In the year before last (thirty-fifth year), I bought three mu and two fen of land and two broken houses with my own hard work. Only then was I no longer starving, and I had a place to live. Last year, I married an old woman in her sixties, so I could finally have a family.

    "content": "Guns and Cannons Should Not Be Discharged Carelessly\n    Ammunition Wasted\n    To the Editor:\n    On the morning of the Lunar New Year's Day, I passed through Shicheng Village, Fourth District, Lincheng County, and heard the sounds of rifles, handguns, hand grenades, and \"cow leg cannons\" (homemade) exploding wildly. According to the villagers, it was to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Most of the people firing guns were cadres and militia members. Zhao Jin, the director of the village's Armed Forces Committee alone, fired more than a dozen bullets. The masses were somewhat dissatisfied, but dared not say anything. I asked the villagers, and they said, \"It's not just our village; the same thing happened in Lujiagou Village.\"\n    I believe that today, in our liberated areas, during the movement to call for thrift and support the front, we should pay even more attention to saving weapons and ammunition. Our weapons should be used on the front lines to kill more enemies, and should not be used as entertainment to be wasted.\n    Reader Qing Xin, Lin Lan, Ji Xiang\n\n    To the Editor:\n    The cadres of the Huguan Armed Forces Committee do not control weapons and fire bullets indiscriminately. The masses report that last winter, the county government and the County Armed Forces issued a joint notice stating that no one is allowed to fire guns at ordinary times, and waste is not allowed during the New Year. But on the second day of the first lunar month, a traffic officer (Comrade Jin Cai) from the County Transportation Bureau came to the Third District to deliver documents and mentioned it during dinner. It is said that the militia members who participated in the war returned and fired machine guns wildly in the city, wasting a lot of bullets. Some merchants asked the militia members for bullets and were given them casually to fire. I think that the comrades who participated in the war have made efforts for the masses and should be rewarded. Even if they get victory products from the front, they should cherish them. Bullets should be fired at the front. The responsible comrades of the County Armed Forces Committee should conduct an inspection to see who is wasting them, in order to stop it.

In the past ten days (from the 7th to the 16th), nearly 5,000 enemy troops have been annihilated. A brief account of the operations and a summary of the results are as follows:\n\n\tSouth of Shenyang: After the PLA captured Liaoyang on the 6th, it swept north to eliminate the remaining enemies. On the 8th, it captured more than ten strongholds, including Shahebao, Wulijie, and Liutanggou, annihilating and capturing more than 1,000 enemy troops from the 52nd Army's 2nd Division and the 79th Division, which was reorganized from the original Provisional 55th Division (note: this division was completely annihilated by us in the Battle of Zhangwu).

Due to unfavorable combat conditions, the enemy army became extremely savage and even released a large amount of poison gas, resulting in the poisoning of some of our soldiers. The enemy's Provisional 62nd Division, which was besieged in Faku, attempted to break through to the south between the 13th and 15th, but was partly annihilated by our forces and pushed back into the isolated city, living in constant fear. West of Shenyang: Our unit successively captured several important stations on the Xinmin-Shenyang section of the Beining Railway, including Masanjiazi, Laobian, and Xinglongdian, between the 12th and 16th, annihilating and capturing a total of more than 700 enemy troops from the 71st Army's 91st Division, the New 1st Army's 50th Division, and an armored train squadron. Our army also captured two enemy armored trains at Laobian Station, bringing the total number of armored trains of the Northeast bandit army captured by the PLA to four, including the two previously captured by us near Siping and Suizhong. A preliminary summary of the battle results in the past ten days is as follows: a total of 4,921 enemy troops were annihilated, including 2,863 killed and wounded, and 2,058 captured alive.

In order to promote hands-on work and develop production, family-run factories of agencies and troops are still permitted to exist. However, family-run stores and cooperatives of a similar store nature must be abolished without exception.\n    2.  Family-run factories and agency mills may hire technicians for a certain period to increase product output and improve quality, but it is strictly forbidden to engage in disguised forms of hired labor management.\n    3.  All factories and coal kilns, during the process of receiving and transferring them, must continue working with the spirit of \"production first, then clearing and handover,\" and must not suspend work without reason, affecting production.\n    4.  For all factories, shops, transportation tools, livestock, bulk cotton, cloth, salt, medicine, telecommunications, printing, military equipment, etc., that are transferred to industry and commerce, transportation, and supply departments, the valuation should be handled according to market conditions and based on the principle of fairness and reasonableness. If there are disputes, the liquidation committees at all levels may designate specific personnel to jointly assess the final price with the transferring and receiving agencies. Both parties must abide by the assessed price.\n    5.  Factories, shops, transportation tools, livestock, bulk cotton, cloth, salt, medicine, telecommunications, military, printing equipment, etc., produced by agencies at all levels, should generally be transferred to the corresponding level of industry and commerce, transportation, and supply departments for reception after valuation. However, if larger factories, telecommunications, health, and other equipment and materials are received at all levels, they must be reported and remitted to the Border Region Government's Industry Department or the Supply Department of the Greater Military Region.\n    6.  Private funds of cadres and soldiers from agencies, troops, organizations, schools, and economic departments are not allowed to be invested in private stores and local cooperatives. After being withdrawn from agency production, they can only be deposited in banks or stores designated by the liquidation committees at all levels. At the border region level, the \"Tongren Cooperative\" will be used as a basis to absorb the private funds of cadres and soldiers, with its business led by the Trade General Company. A management committee will be organized separately by the administrative departments of each agency to conduct inspection and supervision.\n    7.  In order to solve certain deficits of agencies and units at all levels and some difficulties that may arise due to the abolition of agency production, 20% of the received assets may be retained. However, this 20% can only be retained after all agency production has been cleared up and approved by the superior liquidation committee.\n    8.  In order to further deepen the cleanup work, all food service units must organize their own liquidation committees to be responsible for clearing up the agency production and assets of their units. The Party branch should play a guaranteeing role. The organization and cleanup methods shall be formulated by the agencies themselves.\n    9.  Transferable houses and furniture in the agency stores and factories in various cities can be examined and handled by the liquidation committees at all levels. Usable items should be centrally stored for future use. Furniture from production agencies in various villages and towns shall be auctioned off and used as public income.\n    10. In addition to being responsible to the district party committee liquidation committee, the liquidation committees of each unit are also responsible to the central bureau liquidation committee. To facilitate the work, the greater military region liquidation committee will no longer be established, and the central bureau liquidation committee will uniformly preside over the process.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中央局清委会发出通知  清理机关生产  确定补充办法\n\n1948-02-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    中央局清委会发出通知\n    清理机关生产\n    确定补充办法\n    【本报消息】中央局机关生产清理委员会于二月三日向各区党委、各行署、各军区发出第一号通知，内称：\n    兹根据中央局关于清理机关生产决定，及就近日各区各单位提出之问题，特补充以下几点意见，请参照执行。\n    一、为提倡亲自动手，发展生产，各机关部队之家属工厂仍允许存在，但家属商店以及类似商店性质的合作社均须一律取消。\n    二、家属工厂、机关粉坊，为增加产品提高质量，在一定期间可聘请技师，但须严禁变相雇工经营。\n    三、所有工厂、煤窑在接收移转过程中，均须本一面生产，一面清理移交之精神，继续工作，不得无故停工影响生产。\n    四、凡移交工商、交通、供给部门之工厂、商店、运输工具、牲畜、大宗棉花、布、盐、医药、电讯、印刷、军用器材等，其作价应按市场情形，本公平合理之原则办理。如有争执，可由各级清委会指定专人，会同交接机关，作最后之评定，评定价格，双方均须服从。\n    五、各级机关生产之工厂、商店、运输工具、牲畜、大宗棉花、布、盐、医药、电讯、军用、印刷器材等作价后，一般均应移交同级工商、交通、供给部门接收。但如遇较大工厂、电讯、卫生等设备器材，各级收到后须报解边府工业厅或大军区供给部。\n    六、机关部队、团体、学校及经济部门干部战士私人资金，不得投入私人商店及地方合作社，从机关生产抽出后，只准存银行或各级清委会指定之商店。边区级以同仁合作社为基础，吸收干部、战士私人资金，其业务归贸易总公司领导，另由各机关行政部门组织管理委员会，进行检查监督事宜。\n    七、为解决各级机关单位某些亏空，及因取消机关生产可能发生的某些困难，于接收资财中，截留二成，但此二成须俟全部机关生产清理完毕，并经上级清委会审核批准后，始得截留。\n    八、为清理工作更深入一步，各伙食单位均须组织本单位清理委员会，负责进行本单位机关生产及资财之清理，支部应起保证作用。组织及清理办法，各机关自行制定。\n    九、各城市机关商店、工厂中之移交房屋、家具，可分别交由各级清委会审查处理。可用者应集中保管，以备使用。各村镇生产机关之家具准予自行拍卖，作为公家收入。\n    十、各单位之清理委员会，除对区党委清理委员会负责外，并应对中央局清理委员会负责，为便于工作，大军区清理委员会不再设立，统一由中央局清委会主持进行。"

Many cities in Italy held rallies and demonstrations to express their angry protests. At a rally held in Bari, local trade union secretary Di Donato and representatives of various democratic groups spoke in support of the demands made by the Executive Committee of the People's Democratic Front to the reactionary government, namely, to severely punish the instigators and participants of this provocation and to disband the armed fascist forces.

In Yuanwu, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits sent a company of armed troops to the Bailiushu Village area to forcibly requisition grain, inciting resistance from local farmers. They beat the grain requisitioning Chiang Kai-shek bandits to a pulp, killing and wounding thirty people, while several civilians were injured. Subsequently, Chiang Kai-shek's Commissioner Zhang Jingzhong personally led a battalion of bandit soldiers to suppress the people. The people united sixty villages in time and repelled them again, wounding eight enemy soldiers. The third time, bandit leader Zhang Jingzhong sat in two cars and a tank to \"negotiate peace,\" saying that military grain was not needed for the time being.

On January 28th, two plainclothes special agents from the Jiaozuo Chiang Kai-shek National Defense Department's Intelligence Group robbed people on Qilu Road outside the city, encountering four civilians from ×× Village (Chiang-occupied area) who were driving four carts loaded with grain back from Xiuwu. The two special agents saw an opportunity to make a fortune and immediately stepped forward to stop them and search their pockets. In addition to robbing them of 1.6 million 法币, they also untied four animals and wanted to take them all away. The four civilians, seeing that their lifeline was being taken away, rushed forward and pinned down the two special agents and beat them severely. One of them found an opportunity to escape, while the other was beaten until his head was bleeding. In the end, the civilians took back their belongings and captured a ten-shot short rifle with three bullets, returning victoriously. On the same day, several soldiers from the Chiang Kai-shek 40th Division in Yexian went to ×× Village (Chiang-controlled area) to loot grain. Wang Kao's wife had just sold a bolt of cloth and exchanged it for three catties of rice, which was also robbed, driving her to death out of anger!

    "title": "Letter from the Huguan County Government Clarifying No Over-Collection of Labor Service Grain from Workers",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-20",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "To the Editor:\n\nOn February 1st, the \"Criticism and Suggestions\" column on the front page of the People's Daily questioned whether Huguan, Changzi, and other counties had over-collected labor service grain from workers. After reading this, we immediately inquired about the details from Qingliu, Hancun, and Dongguanbi (previously incorrectly printed as Qingbi). We are now providing an explanation here and responding to Comrade Chen Hong's suggestions:\n\n1.  We believe that Comrade Chen Hong's spirit of ensuring that workers are not subjected to double burdens and urging governments at all levels to resolutely implement all orders is commendable and should be taken seriously everywhere.\n\n    However, Comrade Chen Hong stated: \"The Taihang Administrative Office issued an order in December of last year regarding the methods for workers' labor service burdens, the general idea being that workers' labor service grain burdens should be collected by the government where each factory is located.\" And that they had received orders from the Taihang Third Special District and Changzhi City that, starting from November of last year, the labor service grain of factory workers in the city should be handed over to the Changzhi Municipal Government, and villages should not assign any. We formally declare that Huguan did not receive any orders from the Administrative Office in December of last year regarding the methods for workers' labor service burdens, nor did we receive any formal orders from the Third Special District. We only received a letter on December 26th of last year from Section Chief Guo of the Finance and Grain Section of the Third Special District to the Huguan County Head and the Head of the Finance and Grain Section. It said: \"Regarding the issue of labor service burdens for factory workers, except for workers in military and military-supply factories, all workers in public and private factories, as well as non-formal cadre staff, should pay 20 jin of labor service grain per person per month (half from the factory and half from the worker). This should be handed over to the government by the factory in order to uniformly regulate the balance of labor service…\" We interpret the letter's intention as unifying the 20 jin of grain that workers should hand over to their villages and allocating it based on the amount of labor contributed by each village, in order to balance the labor service burden. We believe that the responsibility for managing labor service and uniformly regulating the labor force to achieve balance rests with each county. We do not understand the original intention of handing it over to the government where the factory is located, and we hope everyone will study this.\n\n    No one from Huguan Qingliu, Hancun, or Dongguanbi villages works at the Changzhi Yongsheng Magnetic Factory. Several work at the Bianfu Industrial Research and Manufacturing Institute factory. We are now writing down the actual situation of the collection of labor service grain from workers below, for everyone to understand the truth:\n\n    In Dongguanbi Village, Huguan First District, there is a landlord named Yang Zhenze. The masses have carried out three struggles against his family. Because Yang himself was a foreman at the Bianfu Industrial Research and Manufacturing Institute in Changzhi City, it was believed at the time that he was working for the public, so no struggle was carried out against him personally. However, according to the masses, he has a considerable income as a foreman. Therefore, in addition to collecting income tax from him, we resolutely implemented the \"Provisional Measures for Mobilizing Civilian Labor\" issued by the Taihang Administrative Office in May of last year in terms of labor service grain, collecting 20 jin of labor service grain from him every month. We did not over-collect from him.\n\n    In addition, there are a total of four workers from Qingliu at the Research Institute, all of whom are former middle peasants. One of them, Miao Biandan, paid a total of 60 jin of labor service grain for August, September, and October of last year. We did not overcharge him. Later, the Institute sent a letter to the county government stating that Miao Biandan had been changed to a supply system, so the village did not ask him for 20 jin of labor service grain per month after October.\n\n    Han Guibao, fearing conscription, got into the Institute. After returning to the village from the war, he should have received 300 jin of grain through labor exchange. Because he left the village privately, under the dissatisfaction of the masses, the 300 jin of labor exchange grain he should have received was used to offset his six months (May to October) of labor service grain. This is certainly not appropriate, but it is not the situation that Comrade Chen Hong said: the labor service grain has already been handed over to the factory's location, but the village still wants it, causing the workers to bear a double burden.\n\n    There are also two, Miao Dayan and his father. Dayan is a strong young man, and 20 jin of labor service grain is collected from him every month, which has been handed over to his village. His father, Miao Shicheng, is old and does not perform war support duties, so he should not pay grain, and we did not ask him for it.\n\n    In summary: 1. We have never received a formal order from the Administrative Office or the Special District (after this issue was published in the newspaper, we sent someone to the Third Special District the next day to ask if a formal order had been issued, and the result was no), instructing workers in our county to change the 20 jin of labor service grain they pay to their villages every month to be handed over to the government where the factory is located.\n\n    2. Huguan has not over-collected labor service grain from workers (not a single grain has been handed over since October of the Gregorian calendar, so where does the over-collection come from? It is certainly not a double burden). These are our opinions, and we are writing them out for an exchange of views.\n\n    Covering Liangbi, Huguan County Government. Writing \"Criticism and Suggestions\" should be very serious and very responsible, and there must be absolutely no carelessness, and there should be absolutely no discrepancy with the facts. Now that the Huguan County Government has written to explain the truth, what was the basis for Comrade Chen Hong's initial draft? Where exactly is the mistake? Please also reply. --Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 壶关县府来信说明  没有多收工人差米\n\n1948-02-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    壶关县府来信说明\n    没有多收工人差米\n    编辑同志：\n    二月一日人民日报第一版登的“批评与建议”，问壶关长子等县是否多收了工人支差米！？我们看后当即询问清流、韩村、东关壁（上次登成庆壁）详情，今在这里说明一下。并对读者陈虹同志提出如下意见研究：\n    一、读者陈虹同志为了保证工人不出双重负担，并督促各级政府对一切命令坚决执行，这种建议精神我们觉得很好，应引起各地十分重视。\n    但陈虹同志说：“太行行署去年十二月有过关于工厂工人劳力负担办法的命令，大意是工人的支差负担米由各工厂所在地的政府征收”。并说：他们已接到太行三专署及长治市命令，从去年十一月份起，本市工厂工人的支差米交给长治市政府，各村不得征派等。我们正式声明：去年十二月份壶关没有接到过行署决定工厂工人劳力负担办法的命令，也没有接到过三专署正式命令，只是在去年十二月二十六号，接到过三专署财粮科郭科长给壶关县长和财粮科长的一封信，上面说：“工厂工人劳役负担问题，除军工军需工厂工人外，不论公私工厂工人，与非正式干部之职员，均得每人每月付给差米二十斤（由厂方与工人各出一半）。由工厂交政府，以便统一调剂差务之平衡……”。我们体会来信意思，是将工人应交各村之二十斤米，统一交到政府，在拨差时依各村出外劳力多少，以求力役负担之平衡。我们觉得掌握差务，统一调剂劳力人口以求平衡的责任是在各县，似应将工人差米归工人籍贯县，我们不晓得交工厂住地政府原意是什么，望大家研究。\n    壶关清流、韩村、东关壁没人在长市永生磁厂作工，有几个是在边府工业研究制造所工厂做工。现把工人支差米征收实情，写在下边，供大家了解真相：\n    壶关一区东关壁村有个经营地主叫杨贞则，群众对他家先后进行过三次斗争，因杨本人在边府驻长市工业研究制造所当工头，当时认为他是在给公家干事，所以对他本人并没进行任何斗争。但据群众说：他当工头有相当收入，所以除向他征收收入所得税外，在差米方面，坚决执行了太行行署去年五一颁发的动用民力暂行办法，每月征收他二十斤差米。并没有多收他的。\n    另外清流在研究所的共有四个工人，均系旧中农成份。有一个叫苗扁旦，去年八、九、十三个月，共出差米六十斤，并没向他多要过。后来所里给县府来信说：苗扁旦已改成了供给制度，因此自十月后每月二十斤差米，村上没向他要过。\n    韩贵保怕参军钻进所内。他在参战回村后，经过变工本来应得米三百斤，因他私自离村，在群众不满情况之下，将他应得的三百斤变工米顶了他六个月（五月至十月）的差米。这当然不够妥当，但亦不是象陈虹同志说：差米已交工厂住地，村上又要，使得工人出双重负担那样情况。\n    还有两个是苗大眼父子。大眼系壮年，每月征收二十斤差米，已交住村了。其父苗十成因年老不服战勤，所以不应出米，亦就没和他要过。\n    总之：一、我们从没接到过行、专署正式命令（报上发表这个问题后，第二日我们派人就向三专问看是否发过正式命令，结果说没有），让本县工人把每月交住村的二十斤差米改交工厂住地政府。\n    二、壶关没有多收了工人支差米（自阳历十月后，颗粒未交，从哪来的多收呢？更不是什么变重负担）。以上是我们的意见，特写出供交换意见。壶关县府盖良弼写“批评与建议”应该十分严肃，十分负责，绝不能丝毫的马虎，与事实不应有丝毫出入。现在壶关县府已来信说明事实真相，陈虹同志最初写稿时根据了什么？究竟错在哪里？也请答复。——编者"

On the night of the 26th of last month, we advanced on Honghetun in two routes. One route, composed of a unit of our \"Yangtze\" troops, the South Joint Defense Militia of the Fourth District, and the district cadre team, pressed towards the front gate of the society's headquarters from the southwest of Honghetun. The other route, composed of the work team and the North Joint Defense Militia, pressed towards the back gate of the society's headquarters from the northwest of Honghetun. The two routes coordinated to completely resolve the Chiang bandit society.

The bandits and diehards entrenched in Luzhuang, five miles northeast of Daying, fled upon hearing the news, and more than 80 were intercepted and captured by our pursuit. A total of 41 rifles and pistols and one heavy machine gun were seized.

In the mass movement in the area two months ago, reactionary landlords, incited by the Luoyang Chiang bandit authorities and the Song County Chiang bandit County Chief Gao Mao, gathered some small and medium landlords, hoodlums, and forcibly coerced individual honest farmers to participate in the rebellion. At that time, due to the lack of vigilance on the part of the leadership, three cadres, six activists, and two Taiyue war participants were killed by the bandits. Upon hearing the news, a certain unit of our military sub-district's local armed forces rushed to the scene and joined the masses in severely suppressing the bandits and diehards. In two consecutive battles, more than 20 bandits were killed, and the confidence of the masses greatly increased, while all the bandits and diehards were shaken, and the bandit leaders took the lead in fleeing. Most of the small and medium landlords and feudal rich peasants who participated in the rebellion asked people to mediate and prepared to surrender. The democratic government then adopted a lenient policy, issuing a proclamation that \"those who hand over their guns will not be killed and will be given a portion of land\" and \"all those who are coerced to participate in the bandits will be given land to settle down after handing over their guns.\" Subsequently, more than a dozen bandit leaders handed over more than 70 rifles and three machine guns. More than 40 people who were won back by the masses through family members, relatives and friends to hand over their guns and return to righteousness were also given housing and land. Thus, the rebellion was completely suppressed. The masses accepted this bloody lesson and deeply launched a mass movement to collect guns, and collected 180 guns hidden by landlords and bandits within ten days, and organized hundreds of militiamen. Young peasants flocked to join the local armed forces, and after strict examination, 120 people were accepted into the army in two batches.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 宝丰邓县歼匪二百  嵩县扑灭地主武装叛乱\n\n1948-02-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    宝丰邓县歼匪二百\n    嵩县扑灭地主武装叛乱\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十七日电】八日，五分区地方武装一部清剿宝丰西北地区匪顽，一举攻克距城三十里的大营，毙匪首金礼明以下六十余名，生俘七十余名。盘踞大营东北五里芦庄之匪顽闻讯溃逃，被我追击截捕八十余名。共缴获长短枪四十一支、重机枪一挺。又三分区地方武装一部在滦川附近击溃匪顽七百余名，毙俘各二十余。\n    【新华社鄂豫皖前线十七日电】迟到消息：桐柏军区解放军一部上月二十七日在邓县城北黑龙庙一带消灭蒋匪保安队一部，活捉伪唐河县长王宪辅以下五十一名，缴获轻机枪一挺、步枪五十支、电台一部，其他物资甚多。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线十七日电】嵩县十五个村庄的农民，在地方武装协助下结合政治瓦解，胜利扑灭反动地主的武装叛乱。该区两月前群众运动中，反动地主受洛阳蒋匪当局及嵩县蒋匪县长高茂政策动，纠集了一些中小地主、兵痞流氓，并武力胁迫个别朴实农民参加叛乱。当时因领导上警觉性不高，遭匪杀害干部三人，积极分子六人，和两个太岳参战队员。我分区地方武装某部闻讯，当即赶往，结合群众痛剿匪顽。接连两次战斗中击毙土匪二十余名，群众信心大增，匪顽则全部动摇，匪首相率逃走。大部参加叛乱的中小地主和封建富农都请人说合，准备投降。民主政府乃本宽大政策，布告“交枪不杀并留一份土地”，和“凡被胁迫参加土顽者交枪后均分给土地，安家立业”。相继有十余个土匪头交出步枪七十余支，机枪三挺。群众通过家属、亲戚朋友争取回来交枪归正的亦有四十多人，都分了房地。于是叛乱完全扑灭。群众接受这次血的教训，深入展开了群众性的收枪运动，十天内共收了地主匪顽隐藏的枪支一百八十多条，组织了数百民兵。青年农民更群起要求参加地方武装，经严格审查后，两次共接受一百二十名入伍。"

    "content": "(Jinan News) In Stone Sea Slope Village, Wu Yi County, poor peasants have not truly turned over because bad village cadres have become large boulders, suppressing the poor and hired peasants. These bad village cadres shelter landlords, seize excessive fruits of labor, and engage in corruption and embezzlement. Their backgrounds are complex, and they are lazy and gluttonous; even some with good class backgrounds have forgotten their roots. During last year's mass movement, before the struggle even began, landlords took turns treating the cadres to banquets, resulting in a very incomplete struggle, with many escaping the net. Ma Longxiang, the Farmers' Association director, used the wood from the fruits of labor to make a coffin for himself. Village cadre Guo Juyue used the bricks from the fruits of labor to build three large northern-style rooms and a gatehouse. Village cadres also used money from the fruits of labor to hire people to transport livestock, dividing the profits among themselves. Village cadres divided the good land and couldn't finish farming it, so they rented the rest to poor people. Poor peasant martyr Wei Laoqi said, \"They divided the bad land to us, the family members of soldiers, but the cadres got the good land and couldn't finish farming it. Wei Huachang (village chief) hired a long-term worker this year. We rented four mu of their land to grow melons, and five bags of grain were only planted for one season.\" Poor peasants Zhang Qiu and others still don't have a house or a piece of land, and they all say, \"We poor fellows worked for nothing all winter, just to make up numbers in meetings, staying up late and enduring the cold, but we didn't get anything when dividing things.\" Village chief Wei Huachang and Wei Guanyi cannot get through a day without drinking two jin of liquor, consuming sixty-seven jin just at Guo Qi's tavern. Once, when an old ox died in the village, the village cadres used a slaughter permit to slaughter four fat oxen, feasting and drinking for several days. When they collected public grain, they demanded more grain from the masses. For example, Guo Yutong handed in a bag of wheat, which was weighed at 116 jin at the time. The next day, when it was sent to the warehouse, the original bag was untouched, but it weighed 126 jin. Therefore, after handing in the required amount of grain to the warehouse, there was still a lot of wheat left over. The masses comforted the new soldiers with 400,000 yuan, but the village cadres didn't give it to them. The village cadres also privately fined villagers for some things, and now there is no record of it. The cadres are so corrupt and wasteful that the masses don't dare to say anything. When someone asks, the masses say, \"The cadres are all good!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 石海坡村干分地多  竟租给穷人耕种\n\n1948-02-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n    石海坡村干分地多\n    竟租给穷人耕种\n    【冀南消息】武邑石海坡贫农没有翻身，主要原因是坏村干成了大石头，把贫雇农压住了。这些坏村干掩护地主，多占果实，贪污腐化。他们出身复杂、好吃懒做，有些成份好的也忘了本。去年群众运动时，在没有斗争以前，地主们就轮流请干部的客，因此斗的很不彻底，还有好多漏网的。农会主任马龙骧用果实木头作了寿木，村干郭居月用果实砖盖了三间大北屋、一间门楼。村干部还用果实钱雇人贩牲口，赚了钱分赃。村干部分的好地种不完，剩下的租给穷人。贫农烈属魏老七说：“把坏地分给俺抗属，好地干部分的种不清，魏华昌（村长）今年雇上长活，咱租了他们四亩地种瓜，五口袋谷子只种一季。”贫农张秋等仍是房没一间地没一垄，都说：“咱这穷小子们白和人家闹了一冬天，凑数开会，熬眼挨冻，分东西没有咱”。村长魏华昌和魏贯一一天不喝二斤酒过不去，光在郭起酒馆就喝了六十七斤。有一回村里死了一头老牛，村干部跟着用一个宰杀证宰了四头肥牛，吃喝了好些日子。他们征公粮时，多向群众要粮食，比如郭玉同缴了一口袋麦子，当时过秤说是一百十六斤，第二天向仓库里送时，原口袋一点没有动，过了一百二十六斤。因此向仓库里缴清应征的，还剩下好多麦子。群众慰劳了新战士四十万元，村干都没有给。村干部还私自罚了村民一些东西，现在全没头绪。干部们这样贪污浪费，群众都不敢吭，有人打听，群众就说：“干部们都不错！”"

The Associated Press called it \"an unprecedentedly rapid one\" in American history. The prices of stocks and securities continue to fall, \"the psychological state in the market at the weekend is still one of anxiety,\" and it is especially worth noting that at this time, the Swiss Bank, the economic nerve center of Europe, declared in its recently released annual report: \"There are now all indications that the world business cycle has passed its peak,\" meaning that the world economic crisis is about to come, and therefore the Associated Press has to tremble and say: The Swiss Bank's report is \"of great significance.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Various dispatches: The trend of falling American prices and stock prices was still continuing as of the 15th when foreign news agencies sent their dispatches. According to a dispatch from the National News Agency on the 15th quoting Moscow Radio, \"The current price drop in the United States is very similar to the situation before the economic crisis in 1929.\" Although brokers from major companies are announcing every day: \"The worst is over,\" prices are still falling. On the 13th, in the Chicago grain market, corn and soybeans fell another eight cents per bushel, wheat fell another five cents, butter fell three to five and a half cents, and beef fell seven and a half cents.

In terms of stock and securities trading, \"brokers from major companies are anxiously pacing the floor of the stock exchange again\" (Moscow Radio), and the stock prices of Mellon Company's steel trust \"Anaconda\" and \"American Smelting Company\" are all falling (Associated Press). This situation has forced some American experts to admit: \"Prices will continue to fall.\" Merchants dare not predict market conditions, and American monopoly capitalists are filled with fear of economic crisis (revealed by Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency).

    "content": "The Spanish People in Heroic Struggle\n\nA Precious Last Testament\n\nOne day in February 1946, Cristino Garcia, the famous Spanish resistance leader, wrote a letter to his comrades from Carabanchel prison. He had been waiting a long time for the opportunity to write this letter. The letter read:\n\n\"You may wonder why I didn't write to you sooner. This is because I was previously unsure whether the communication channels we are currently using are secure, fearing that what I wrote would fall into the hands of the spies.\"\n\nHe felt that this letter might be his last, so he wrote: \"I know what my end will be... The situation for me and other comrades is hopeless.\" After briefly describing the terrible tortures he had suffered, he conveyed his experiences as a resistance leader to his comrades in a few concise sentences. The first thing that came to his mind was the importance of launching guerrilla warfare in Spain:\n\n\"Before I breathe my last, I want to tell you some experiences that I believe will prove useful... Nothing frightens the bandits more than guerrilla warfare. The greatest attention must be paid to the development of guerrilla warfare. I believe that in selecting the commanders of the guerrilla units, one must be very careful. They should be capable people.\"\n\nThe Flames of Guerrilla Warfare are Lit in Every Province\n\nComrade Garcia was shot by the bandits, but his comrades followed his advice. Today, there is not a single province in Spain without well-organized and well-equipped guerrilla units. The following figures are a powerful illustration:\n\n1945, the guerrilla forces fought 350 battles – an average of 29 battles per month.\n\n1946, fought 446 battles – an average of 37 battles per month.\n\nIn the first two months and twelve days of 1947, fought 98 battles – an average of 40 battles per month.\n\nThe famous Republican military leader, Juan Modesto, recently made an analysis of these battles. He pointed out that it not only demonstrates the scale and diversity of the guerrilla movement, but also its growth and development. In these battles, the guerrilla forces were in the initiative 75 percent of the time. The days when Franco's army was relentlessly pursuing and the guerrillas were always on the defensive are over.\n\nRevenge on the Falangist Bandits\n\nRetaliation against the Falangist bandits is a very important part of the guerrilla activities. It helped to disintegrate the enemy's ferocity and supported the morale of the entire resistance movement.\n\nOn January 14th this year, resistance leaders Isasa and Rellán were murdered by Falangist bandits. Six days later, the Galician guerrilla command published an order for revenge in its newspaper:\n\nOrder\n\nJanuary 20th, at the Galician Guerrilla Command\n\nThe two guerrilla leaders, Isasa and Rellán, were vilely murdered by Franco's bandits in Madrid on the 14th of this month. In order to avenge them, I hereby issue the following order:\n\nEach guerrilla unit must execute four Franco bandits before February 14th, and the commanders of each unit are responsible for reporting the completion of the order to this headquarters in writing before the aforementioned deadline.  Julián (signed)\n\nHow the various Galician guerrilla units carried out this order can be seen from the facts reported below.\n\nIn late January, the mayor of Vigo, in the Lago area, was killed and a civil guard was wounded.\n\nOn January 28th, a civil guard in Betanzos was killed and another was wounded.\n\nOn February 2nd, one civil guard each was killed in Gunas and Florin.\n\nOn February 3rd, a unit of civil guards was ambushed in the Caquero area.\n\nOn February 11th, the Falangist chieftain of Odón, Linares, was killed.\n\nOn February 13th, the Falangist chief and mayor of Oreros, Caunas, was killed.\n\nThis explains why the *Time* magazine reporter in its recent report also mentioned \"the strengthening of guerrilla activity throughout Spain\" and \"the existence of a general state of tension.\"\n\nOrganizing the Peasant Army\n\nThe increasing growth of guerrilla activity naturally attracted the attention of Franco's bandits. Last summer they launched a full-scale offensive against the guerrillas. Although a large number of mechanized troops participated in this offensive, it finally failed completely. After the failure of the direct offensive, Franco has now turned to more cunning means. They organized \"special anti-guerrilla detachments,\" composed of former Blue Shirts, civil guards, professional agents, and criminals, and gave them special training. These special detachments, recognizing that the guerrillas can exist because they have the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the people, often disguised themselves as guerrillas, and then killed and set fires in order to undermine the peasants' faith in the guerrillas. After a fake guerrilla unit passed through a village, any farmer who expressed sympathy with the anti-fascist guerrillas was arrested. They also often attempted to infiltrate the real guerrilla units.\n\nUnder these circumstances, in order to fight victoriously, the guerrillas organized a vast \"information network\" among the people, paying attention to every activity of the Falangist bandits. The entry of a stranger into the village and any unusual actions must be reported to the resistance movement.\n\nAt the March meeting of the Communist Party of Spain, Modesto spoke about several guidelines for developing the guerrilla warfare movement. Pointing out that the mass struggle of the peasants lagged behind the struggle of the workers, he said that the responsibility of the guerrillas is to help the peasants organize and lead their struggle against the landlords and the Falangist bandits. Modesto also spoke of the need to organize hundreds of guerrilla groups in factories, mines, and ports. He said: \"We must start doing this now, because the frequently occurring struggles of protests, demonstrations, and strikes should have their own self-defense organizations.\" (Written by Aili'ao, translated by Hongjie from \"Spain Today,\" July 1947 issue)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英勇斗争中的西班牙人民\n艾里奥\n1948-02-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    英勇斗争中的西班牙人民\n    一封宝贵的遗书\n    一九四六年二月的某一天，西班牙著名的抵抗领袖克利斯蒂诺·加西亚从卡拉班彻狱中给他的同志们写来了一封信。他等待写这封信的机会已是很久了。这封信上写道：\n    “你们也许奇怪，我为什么不早点写这封信给你们。这是因为我从前不知道我们现在所用的通讯路线是否是保险的，因而唯恐我写的东西落到特务们的手里去。”\n    他已觉得这封信也许是他的最后一封信了，所以他又写道：“我知道我的结局是什么……我和其他同志的情势是没有什么希望了。”他在简单描述他所受的可怕肉刑后，即以简洁的几句话，把他作的抵抗领袖的经验，转告给他的同志们。他脑子所想到的第一件事就是在西班牙展开游击战的重要性：\n    “在我停止呼吸之前，我愿告诉你们一些经验，这些经验我相信将会证明是有用的。……没有什么东西比游击战争更能使匪徒们害怕了。必须把最大的注意力放在发展游击战争问题上。我认为在选择游击队的指挥员上，必须十分谨慎。他们应是些精干的人。”\n  每省都点起了游击战争的火焰\n    加西亚同志是被匪徒们枪杀了，但他的同志们遵循了他的忠告。西班牙今天已经没有一个省没有组织完善与装备优良的游击队了。下面的数字是个有力的说明：\n    一九四五年，游击队作战三五○次——平均每月作战二十九决。\n    一九四六年，作战四四六次——平均每月作战三十七次。\n    一九四七年头两个月又十二天，作战九十八次——每月平均四十次。\n    著名的共和国军事领袖余安·摩德斯托最近对这些战斗作了一个分析。他指出，它不仅表现出游击战运动的规模与多样性，而且也表现出游击战的壮大与发展。在这些战斗中，百分之七十五都是游击队掌握主动。佛朗哥军队穷追不舍和游击队永远处于防守地位的时日，是业已过去了。\n    向长枪党匪徒复仇\n    对长枪党匪徒的报复是游击队活动的一个很重要部分。它帮助瓦解了敌人的凶势，支持了整个抵抗运动的士气。\n    今年一月十四日，抵抗领袖伊萨沙与勒兰底二人被长枪党匪徒杀害。六天后，加里西亚的游击队司令部在它的报纸上，发表了复仇的命令：\n  命令\n    一月二十日于加里西亚游击队司令部\n    伊萨沙和勒兰底两位游击队领袖已于本月十四日在马德里被佛朗哥匪徒卑鄙杀害。为了报仇，我特发出下列命令：\n    每个游击部队必须在二月十四日以前，正法四个佛匪凶手，并责成各部队司令在上述限期之前，以书面向本部报告完成命令的情形。    余里安（签字）\n    加里西亚各游击部队怎样执行了这一命令，可从下面一篇报导的事实中看出来。\n    一月下旬拉哥区的维戈市市长被打死，一个宪兵被打伤。\n    一月二十八日，贝坦佐地方一个宪兵被打死，另一个受伤。\n    二月二日，古的那斯及佛林各有一个宪兵被杀死。\n    二月三日，一队宪兵在卡区罗地方遭受伏击。\n    二月十一日，奥登涅的长枪党匪魁林那雷斯被打死。\n    二月十三日，奥雷罗斯的长枪党匪首兼市长考纳斯被打死。\n    这就说明，为什么美国时代周刊记者在其最近的报导中，也说到“西班牙全国游击队活动的加强”和“普遍紧张状态的存生。”\n  把农民大军组织起来\n    游击队活动的日益增长自然引起了佛朗哥匪徒的注意。去年夏天他们曾对游击队发动了全面的攻势。这一攻势虽有大量机械化部队的参加，但最后终于完全失败了。佛朗哥在直接进攻失败之后，现在便转而采取更狡猾的手段。他们组织了“反游击队的别动队，由前蓝衫队员、宪兵、职业特务及罪犯组成，并予以特种训练。这些别动队由于认识到游击队之所以能存在，是由于获得广大人民的同情与支持，便常常乔装为游击队，然后杀人放火，以破坏农民对游击队的信仰。这种假游击队在经过一个村庄后，凡是表示同情反法西斯游击队的农民，都遭到逮捕。他们还常常企图打入真正的游击队里面来。\n    在这种情况下，游击队为了胜利作战，就在人民中组织了广大的“情报网”，注意长枪党匪徒的每个活动。一个生人的入村和任何人的奇突行动，都必须给抵抗运动报告。\n    在西班牙共产党的三月会议上，摩德所托说到了发展游击战运动的若干方针。他在指出农民的群众性斗争还落在工人斗争之后说：游击队的责任是帮助农民组织起来，领导他们反对大地主，及长枪党匪徒的斗争。摩氏还说到在各工厂、矿山、港口中组织成百个游击小组的必要。他说：“我们现在就要动手这样去做，因为抗议、示威及罢工等经常发生的斗争，应当有它自己自卫的组织”。（艾里奥作。鸿节译自“今日西班牙”四七年七月号）"

Soviet ambassadors to Paris and Washington also issued similar statements.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th.

The leading organ of the West German Communist Party recently issued a statement, firmly stating: \"The German Communist Party will never recognize the West German separatist government in Frankfurt.\" The statement pointed out: The German people will establish an all-German Consultative Committee as soon as possible to organize a German central government and prepare for the election of a people's congress to hold a referendum on the issue of German unification. The Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party in the Soviet zone, as well as the chairmen of the states in the zone, fiercely criticized the \"Joint Zone Charter\" as threatening German unification and decided to participate in the second German People's Congress to be held on March 17.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英美法片面召开三国会议  阴谋进一步分裂德国  苏联发表声明严厉指责\n\n1948-02-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    英美法片面召开三国会议\n    阴谋进一步分裂德国\n    苏联发表声明严厉指责\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：美、英、法政府决于十九日在伦敦单独召开三国会议，讨论进一步分裂德国之具体步骤。苏驻英大使查鲁滨代表苏政府，特于十三日向英外相贝文提出严正声明，促起英政府注意，声明称：三国会议将审议的对德一般政策及西部德国等问题，属于全体对德占领国的权限，且涉及其它欧洲国家，因此不得采取单独行动。声明严厉指责召集这种会议是违犯波茨顿协定及德国管制机构的协定。声明郑重指出：此种会议中所通过的决定，苏联政府概不承认其为合法。苏联驻巴黎与华盛顿大使亦发表同样声明。\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】柏林讯：西德联合占领区六日颁布所谓“宪章”后，激起各方的强烈反对。苏占领军司令索柯罗夫斯基元帅在十一日的盟国管委会上，警告英美军司令称：由于他们分裂德国，因而破坏了德国管制机关，由此而引起的一切后果，将由英美当局负全责。西德共产党领导机关，日前发表声明，坚称：“德共决不承认在佛兰克福的西德分裂政府”。声明指出：德国人民将尽速成立全德咨询委员会，以组织德国中央政府：并筹备人民大会选举，俾对德国统一问题举行复决。苏占区基督教民主联盟及自由民主党及该占区各州主席，猛烈抨击“联合占区宪章”威胁德国统一，并决定参加将于三月十七日召开第二届德国人民代表大会。"

He carried a polite letter from the regiment and company, writing that Comrade Xu Qianzhi had been placed under confinement and was preparing to be punished with hard labor. At that time, Comrade Li immediately talked with the village cadres about the process of Xu's issues. We told Comrade Li all of Xu's problems, and Comrade Li collected all the materials. Finally, Li talked a lot about Xu's mistakes in a polite manner, and told us about the discipline of the troops. Li made up for the grass money that Xu had shorted, according to the market price, a total of 10,630 yuan. He also insisted on paying the rental price for twenty quilts.

    "content": "Middle peasants generally support the Land Law. However, some middle peasants, because they are not yet clear about the spirit of the policy, and with the addition of rumors spread by landlords and bad cadres, have shown panic. For example, Chen Kun and Liu Jingxin, middle peasants in Putong Village, Shahe, said: \"We are not afraid of equal distribution, but we are afraid of being labeled as a 'struggle target'.\" Qin Yuanjin, a woman from Henan Village, Licheng, said: \"We can't participate in the poor and hired peasant groups organized in our village. Since we are middle peasants, aren't you afraid of struggling against us! These days, I am not enthusiastic about spinning.\" Wang Duofu, a middle peasant in Daguang, Third District, Zuoquan, sold his donkey for fear of equal distribution. Li Yintong, who originally didn't have enough grain to eat, heard that the Land Law required him to sell grain. Cheng Youxiang, a middle peasant in Dongliukai Village, Cixian, said: \"There is a major land reform! I harvested three shi of corn and two shi of millet in the autumn, and I want to sell it all.\"\n    The anxiety of the middle peasants is temporary. After correctly explaining the Land Law, the emotions of the middle peasants will quickly stabilize. They will seek reliance on the poor and hired peasants, agree to equal distribution, and actively engage in production. For example, in Xiaqu Village, Shahe, the village cadres used to read newspapers for propaganda, but the middle peasants did not believe it. After the students from the Three Highs went to correctly publicize the Land Law, the middle peasants said: \"If we had known this earlier, we wouldn't have panicked!\" Cheng Shenglai, a middle peasant in Donglianghou, Wuxiang, said: \"This outline is very good for me. In the past, I didn't dare to prosper because I was afraid that good people would be 'moved' against. This time, after the equal distribution, those who should be allocated will get some, and those that should not be moved will not be moved. Some of the land that is plentiful and good will be taken out, which is fair. There will be no more movements in the future. Now my heart is stable, and I dare to prosper.\" Some middle peasants in Xingtai were initially afraid of being struggled against and wanted to \"voluntarily\" take out a few mu of land. After correctly publicizing the Land Law, they learned that the movable property of middle peasants would not be touched, and only wealthy middle peasants would be asked to take out some of their surplus land through consultation. Zhang Qili, a middle peasant in Zhangdong Village, bought a mule to engage in production, and Li Fang also borrowed 280,000 yuan from the village credit cooperative to buy a mule and build a cart to pull loads outside.\n    From these situations, we should strive to expand the publicity of the Land Law and explain it to the middle peasants more. Not only should we stabilize their emotions and dispel their doubts and misunderstandings, but we should also make them aware that the Land Law has actual benefits for them, that they have a place in politics, and that in the future they will be absorbed into farmers' associations and government work. We should inspire them to truly rely on the poor and hired peasants, join hands with the poor and hired peasants, unite closely together to fight against feudal remnants, and equally distribute land together to strive for democratic rights and fair burdens.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中农懂了土地法  更加安心敢发家\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中农懂了土地法  更加安心敢发家\n    广大中农是拥护土地法的。也有些中农因为还不明确政策的精神，再加地主、坏干部的造谣，表现了恐慌。如沙河普通庄中农陈昆、刘景心说：\"平分俺也不怕，只怕落'斗争对象'名。\"黎城河南村妇女秦远金说：\"咱村组织贫雇小组咱不能参加，又是中农，你怕不斗争咱哩！这几天，我纺织也不起劲。\"左权三区大光中农王多富，怕平分就把驴卖了。李银同本来打的粮食不够吃，听了土地法还要粜粮食。磁县东六开村中农程有祥说：\"土地大改革哩！我秋天收了三石玉茭子，两石谷子，我都要卖了它。\"\n    中农的不安是暂时的，经过正确解释土地法以后，中农情绪很快的就会安定了下来，向贫雇找依靠，赞成平分，并且积极生产了。如沙河霞渠村，早先村干部读报宣传，中农都不相信。到三高学生去正确宣传土地法后，中农都说：\"早知道这样，可不心慌啦！\"武乡东良候中农程身来说：\"这大纲对我很好，以前我就不敢发家，害怕闹好人家给'运动'了。这次平分后，该分的分上些，不动的不动，地多又好的抽一些，都公道了，以后就不运动了。我现在心就安定了，也敢发家了。\"邢台有些中农起先怕斗，想\"自动\"拿出几亩地来。正确宣传土地法后，知道了中农浮财不动，只是富裕中农才用协商方式拿出多余的一些土地。张东村中农张起礼就买了一头骡子闹生产，李芳也在村信用部贷了二十八万元，买了骡子修了大车，到外面去拉脚。\n    从这些情形看，我们应该努力扩大宣传土地法，多多给中农解释。不但要稳定他们的情绪，去掉他们的疑惑和误解，还要使他们知道土地法对他们有实际利益，在政治上有他们的地位，将来还要吸收他们参加农会和政权工作。启发他们真正依靠贫雇，同贫雇农拉起手来，亲密团结一起向封建残余进行斗争，一起平分土地争取民主权利和公平负担。"

    "content": "Endured All Hardships, Herding Sheep All His Life\n    ——A Brief Biography of Old Shepherd Zhang Baozhu\n    The shepherd Zhang Baozhu is fifty-seven years old this year. He is from Shidong Village, Wu'an. From a very young age, he was so poor that he had nothing. He herded sheep for others all his life. After the War of Resistance, he finally accumulated some money and bought three mu of land and a dilapidated house. However, even now, he is still looked down upon and still oppressed by some bad village cadres. The following is his experience of more than fifty years:\n    When his father was alive, he didn't have any land at all. His father was very hardworking, herding sheep for others. Later, when he got old, he became addicted to opium, which ruined his health, and no one hired him anymore. Later, he wandered around begging in the west and died of illness in Tongyi Village.\n    Baozhu's mother died right after he was born, and he was raised in his maternal grandmother's home. At that time, there were four people in his maternal grandmother's family, with seven or eight mu of land. They could barely make ends meet by eating bran and wild vegetables. When Baozhu grew to be seven or eight years old, his maternal grandmother's family also fell on hard times. Baozhu returned to his village to beg for food, but he couldn't get enough to eat every day, so he went back to his maternal grandmother's home. His maternal grandmother came up with a plan for him, telling him to go to Wu'an city to herd sheep. He started herding sheep for a butcher shop owned by a family named Han, with an annual salary of a little over one string of cash. From then on, he herded sheep for others. He herded in Wu'an city for two years, and then went to the earth mountain to herd for another family. He herded on the earth mountain for four years, earning only twelve strings of cash. He returned to his hometown, Shidong, but couldn't find work, so he helped this wealthy man for a few days and helped that wealthy man for a few days, exchanging it for a bowl of rice to pass the time. This was not a sustainable way to live, so later he herded sheep for the old Zhishan family, without any wages, just food and clothing. In the fourth month of that year, a sheep fell off a cliff and died. Baozhu returned and was tied to a tree by old Zhishan and severely beaten with a shepherd's whip. After being beaten, Baozhu was afraid that old Zhishan would break off relations with him, so he secretly ran away. He ran to Songjiang Rock and herded sheep for a wealthy man named Wang, earning only two strings of cash a year. He continued to herd for five or six years, and then went to Wanbei City for more than a year. At that time, the wages were too low, not even enough to buy clothes, so he returned to Shidong, still helping this family for a few days and that family for a few days. When he was twenty years old, he couldn't stand it at home, so he fled to Xijing, Licheng, to herd sheep for others. He earned thirty silver dollars a year. He herded in Xijing for twelve years, and then went to Xiaozhai Village for three years. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he returned home and herded sheep in the Tonghui and Haozhuang areas. It wasn't until last winter that he stopped herding sheep.\n    Last year, he used the wages he earned, 15,000 yuan, to buy two mu and two fen of land. The year before last, he used 360 yuan to buy a dilapidated house. Adding the mu or so of land he bought in the previous years, he had a total of more than three mu.\n    During the land reform, he was given a share of the fruit money to buy two broken sedan chairs, a vat, a door curtain, a kang table, four pieces of clothing (all in red and green, none of which could be worn), a cloth bag, and a broken bundle cloth. He had to buy them, as this was decided by the village cadres, and no one could choose.\n    He said: \"In the past, when people talked about suffering, they didn't include shepherding. They always said that shepherding was an easy job that didn't require much effort. They didn't know that the suffering endured by shepherds was the greatest! Regardless of wind or rain, people and sheep suffered together on the mountain. During the day when it rained, the sheep had to be driven back, for fear of rotting the wool. At night when it rained, they had to be driven out, for fear of rotting the sheep's hooves. Alas! It's not a good business! That year, when I was herding sheep in the village, two sheep ate a few mouthfuls of millet from Zhang Hongsheng's field. He hit me with a stick as thick as a fist. After hitting me, he wasn't finished, and kicked me down the cliff, saying it was not enough to have kicked your little wife's nephew to death! Both of my legs were unable to move, and I was lucky that the neighbors carried me back.\"\n    He said: \"The times have changed, and people say that the poor are going to be the masters! I thought to myself: What masters? It's enough not to suffer or be bullied. Who knew that we still suffer. That year, they asked me to herd sheep for the village office, giving me one jin of rice a day, which I thought was too little. Later, they agreed that I would get a share of the sheep dung, and the village cadres also agreed. Later, when the dung was divided, the village chief, Duan Yonghe, wouldn't let me have it and sold it all himself. He's the village chief, so I didn't dare to say anything. They gave me a share of the food (fruit), and I was unhappy, so at the general meeting, the village cadres said that anyone who had any opinions should raise them. I thought I would raise it! So I said: Comrades, take a look, is my share more or less? If it's more, reduce it a bit more. Before I could finish a sentence, Bingnan's father pointed at me and said that I was disrupting the meeting and wanted to get me up, which scared me so much that I didn't dare to speak anymore. When they call me to a meeting, I go, and if they don't call me, I don't go. I don't dare to offer many opinions, because they retaliate severely.\" (Written by Zhu Bo)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 吃尽苦中苦  放羊一辈子——老羊工张保柱小传\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　吃尽苦中苦  放羊一辈子\n    ——老羊工张保柱小传\n    羊工张保柱，今年五十七岁。武安石洞村人。从很小就穷的什么都没有。给人家放了一辈子羊。抗战以后，他才积蓄了几个钱，买了三亩多地，一处破房子。但是，直到现在，他仍然被人瞧不起，仍然受着一些坏村干的压制。下面是他五十多年的经历：\n    他爹在的时候，就没有一点土地了。他爹很能受苦，给人家放羊。后来年纪大了，吸上大烟，把身体吸坏了，再也没有人用了。后来流落在西边要饭吃，在同义村病死了。\n    保柱刚刚生下来，他娘就死了，在姥姥家养着他。那时候他姥姥家共四口人，有七、八亩地，吃糠咽菜，还能顾住嘴。保柱长到七、八岁，他姥姥家的时光也不行了。保柱回到本村要饭吃，每天要不饱，又回到他姥姥家。他姥姥给他想了个办法，叫他到武安城去放羊。开始给一家姓韩的肉房里放羊，一年工资是一吊多钱。从此以后就一直给人家放羊。在武安城放了二年，又到土山上给另一家放。在土山上放了四年，才挣了十二吊钱。回到老家石洞，找不着活干，就给这个老财帮几天忙，给那家有法的帮几天忙，换碗饭来过时光。这样受下去不是办法，后来就给老致善家放羊，不给工线，光管吃管穿。那年四月里，一个羊跌到崖下跌死了。保柱回来，被老致善捆在树上，用放羊的鞭子痛打一顿。保柱挨了打，还怕老致善和他不完，就偷偷的跑了。跑到宋江岩，给一家姓王的老财放羊，一年才挣两吊钱。一直又放了五、六年，以后又到宛北城放了一年多。那时候工价太少，还不够穿衣服，就又回到石洞，仍然是给这家受几天，给那家受几天。二十岁的时候，在家实在站不住了，逃到黎城西井给人家放羊。一年挣三十块现洋。在西井放了十二年，又到小砦村放了三年。民国十一年又回了家，到同会、郝庄一带放羊。一直到去年冬天才算不放羊了。\n    去年他用挣的工资一万五千元，买了二亩二分地。大前年用三百六十元买了一处破房子，加上头几年买的亩把地，一共有了三亩多。\n    土地改革中，分给他一份果实钱，买了两顶破轿，一个缸，一个门帘，一个炕桌，四件衣服（都是红的绿的一件也不能穿），一个布袋，一个破包袱皮。不买不行，这是村干部订好的，谁也不能挑选。\n    他说：\"过去人们说起受苦的人，就不连着放羊的。都是说放羊这个活用不着卖力气。他们那知道，放羊人受的苦顶大呀！不管刮风下雨，人和羊一块在山上受着。白天下雨，要把羊赶回来，怕沤了羊毛。夜里下雨，要赶出来，怕烂羊蹄子。唉！可不是好营生啊！那年在本村里放羊，有两个羊吃了张洪生家几嘴谷子，人家拿拳头粗的棍子打我，打完了还不算完，一脚把我踢在崖下边，说摔死你个小妻侄还少你哩！打的我两条腿都不能动啦，多亏邻家把我抬回来。\"\n    他说：事变了，人们说穷人要当家哩！我心里就想：当啥家呀！不受罪不受气就行了。谁知道还是受气。那年叫我给村公所放羊，一天给一斤米，我嫌少。后来说好，羊粪有我的一股，村干部也答应了。后来分粪，村长段永和不叫我要了，粪都叫他给卖了。人家是村长，咱没有敢吭气。分火食（果实），分给我一份，我心眼不高兴，在大会场上，村干部说谁有啥意见谁就提。我心想提提吧！我就说：群众们，看看我这一份多呀还是少？多就再减一减。一句话没说完，人家炳南爹就指着我，说我是搞乱会场，要把我弄起来，吓的咱再也不敢说话了。开会时叫去就去，不叫去就算，意见多不敢提，他们报复的厉害。（朱波代笔）"

They killed or wounded 470 enemy soldiers, captured 120 alive, and also killed, wounded, or captured 164 members of the \"Returning Home Corps.\" They seized 5 light machine guns, 25 submachine guns, 57 rifles and carbines, and 193 vehicles of various sizes. (2) In the recent half-month from January 20th to February 3rd, the Fushan suburban guerrilla team twice struck at bandits and puppet troops who ventured out from the city to loot, eliminating 301 enemy soldiers and seizing a portion of their weapons. Also, in early January, the Fushan people's armed blasting team detonated 36 landmines under the city walls, killing or wounding 51 enemy soldiers and capturing one. (3) In the outer areas of Longkou, after our army recovered strongholds within 30 li east of the city, such as Huangshangguan, Shangmengjia, Xiaochenjia, Shuangmiao Xujia, and Aoshang, we immediately surrounded Longkou City. We even once attacked the airfield 3 li southeast of the city and the city's electric light company. Although the enemy repeatedly gathered forces to try to rebuild strongholds such as Aoshang, they were all defeated by our army. In the past two months, we have killed or wounded 1,366 enemy soldiers, captured 64, and seized 7 light machine guns, 20 submachine guns and carbines, and 58 rifles and carbines. Under our political offensive, 570 enemy soldiers and members of the \"Returning Home Corps\" defected to our side. Currently, the enemy in Longkou City is surrounded by our army on the east, south, and west sides, while the Bohai Sea to the north is blocked by thick ice, making supply and transportation extremely difficult, and the situation is becoming increasingly critical.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The Fushan Working Team in Jiaodong, divided into four routes on the 7th and 8th of this month, crossed the enemy's tight blockade and went deep into villages within several li of the suburbs of Yantai City. They crushed the Chiang Kai-shek puppet organizations and other units in 17 villages, including Zhujia Village, capturing the puppet self-defense regiment leader Shen Zhizhang and 150 others alive, and seizing a portion of their weapons.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: Local armed forces and militia in the Tai'an area of central Shandong successfully smashed the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' \"mopping-up\" operation between January 10th and 26th. On the 10th of last month, the enemy's 77th Brigade from Tai'an and a regiment of the enemy's 187th Brigade from Laiwu advanced east and west along the Tai-Lai Road, respectively. After converging in Fanjiadian, east of Tai'an, they \"mopped up\" north of the Tai-Lai Road. They encountered separate resistance and ambushes from our army along the Yangqiu Mountain line, eliminating an enemy company and killing or wounding over 200. At the same time, another unit of our army, coordinating with concentrated firepower, took the opportunity to rush into the 77th Brigade's headquarters in Tangjia Wangxu. The brigade commander fled in panic across the river back to enemy strongholds in Shuibei (northwest of Laicheng) and the Tai'an area. On the 20th and 21st, two regiments of the 112th Brigade and two regiments of the 213th Brigade, advancing from Licheng and Boshan, were also severely attacked by us in Liubu, Hulaoguan, and other places by the 26th, killing or wounding over 100, and forcing them to retreat to their strongholds.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 困踞烟台福山龙口蒋匪  两月被歼两千四百　鲁中泰山区打垮敌“扫荡”\n\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　困踞烟台福山龙口蒋匪\n    两月被歼两千四百\n　  鲁中泰山区打垮敌“扫荡”\n    【新华社华东十九日电】胶东游击战讯：（一）烟台外围地方武装，一月份内主动袭敌及打击抢粮匪伪共大小战斗六十六次，毙伤敌四七○名、生俘敌一二○名，另毙伤俘“还乡团”一六四名、缴获轻机枪五挺、冲锋枪二五支、长短枪五七支、大小车一九三辆。（二）一月二十日至本月三日近半个月中，福山城郊游击队两次打击自城内出动抢掠匪伪，歼敌三○一名、缴获武器一部。又上月上旬，福山人民武装爆炸队于城下炸雷三十六枚，毙伤敌五一名、俘敌一名。（三）龙口外围，我军自收复市东三十里内之黄山馆、上孟家、小陈家、双庙徐家、廒上等据点后，即将龙口市团团包围，并一度攻入市东南三里之飞机场及市内电灯公司等处，敌虽数次集结兵力图重建廒上等据点，均为我军击溃，两月来共毙伤敌一、三六六名、俘敌六四名、缴轻机枪七挺、冲锋、卡宾枪二十支、长短枪五八支，在我政治攻势下投诚来归之敌士兵及“还乡团”等达五七○人。现龙市之敌，东、南、西三面为我军包围，北面渤海、坚冰封锁，补给运输极端困难，形势日益危急。\n    【新华社华东十九日电】胶东福山武工队、本月七、八两日分四路越过敌人严密封锁，深入烟台市郊数里内各村庄活动，将朱家村等十七个村的蒋伪组织等部打垮，活捉伪自卫团长申芝章等共一百五十名，缴获武器一部。\n    【新华社华东十九日电】鲁中泰山区地方武装、民兵于一月十日至二十六日间胜利打垮蒋匪“扫荡”。上月十日泰安敌七七旅及莱芜敌一八七旅一个团分别沿泰莱路东西并进，在泰安东范家镇会合后即向泰莱路以北“扫荡”，至羊邱山一线遭我军分别阻击与伏击，歼敌一连毙伤其二百余名。同时我另部配合密集火力乘机冲进七七旅旅部驻地唐家王许，旅长仓皇渡河逃回水北（莱城西北）及泰安一带敌据点。二十、二十一两日由历城、博山出犯的一一二旅两个团和二一三旅两个团至二十六日亦被我于柳埠、虎牢关等地痛击，先后毙伤其百余名，龟缩据点。"

    "content": "【Jinan News】Linlibao in Chengci District No. 1 was previously considered a model village in the district, but in reality, landlords were still running rampant. Zheng Baohe, the militia captain, was a landlord from Lian Song Village. After hitting someone with a gun, he ran to Linlibao to farm for a landlord. After Chengci was liberated, during the rent reduction and repayment movement, he pretended to be active and became the militia captain. The masses called him \"Little Tiger.\" From the moment he took office, he became a large stone slab on the heads of the masses. He did many bad things, mainly: 1. Sheltering landlords. During the re-examination, he told the landlords to beg for food and pretend to be poor, and he spread rumors saying, \"Our village has thoroughly struggled! The landlords are all begging for food!\" Deceiving superiors and the masses, but in reality, the struggle was far from thorough. 2. Embezzlement and waste. He privately imposed a bullet fee of 280,000 yuan per household, with middle peasants paying 200 yuan, poor peasants paying 100 yuan, and village cadres, militia, and thugs not paying. He embezzled all this money. There were thirty-eight large trees in the orchard, with the smallest one selling for 18,000 yuan, which he also embezzled. He also colluded with a few militiamen to steal five large bundles from the orchard. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, he forced ten middle-peasant households to contribute 10,000 yuan each, which he and a group of village cadres ate and drank. There was a residence of the village's landlord in the city, which he secretly sold for 300,000 yuan, immediately spending 10,000 yuan with the militia and using the remaining 290,000 to buy a Mauser C96 pistol (at that time, 100,000 yuan could buy one). 3. Using hooligans to bully women, using the excuse of checking household registration at night to enter homes at will. 4. Seizing the orchard's produce. Good things all ended up in the hands of village cadres, militia, and thugs. He himself received more than twenty pieces of good lacquer furniture. His land was near good well-irrigated land, but he reported that he only had fifteen mu of grassland. When distributing the orchard's produce, he stood at the door with a gun, specifying what you could have, and if you complained that it was bad or little, he would curse loudly. Red pauper Han Jinrong once resisted his domineering behavior and was detained two or three times. Red pauper Shi Huaizhi, after several struggles, only received a few broken jars, broken boxes, and broken cabinets. 5. He carried the official seals of the Farmers' Association and the village government and privately issued a pass to the wife of Cao Lianfu, who was a secret agent, telling her to go to Zhangde to find Cao Lianfu. When the investigation team arrived in his village, he was afraid that the masses would mention his mistakes, so he secretly held a mass meeting saying: \"The investigation team came to our village and won't do anything good. No one is allowed to speak to them. Don't let them eat their fill at anyone's home. Are you not afraid of us? Just wait and see.\" When the poor peasants organized, he said, \"I don't give a damn about these guys.\" The masses decided to have him confess, and he was removed from his post at the confession meeting.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 地主当了民兵队长  林里堡群众受欺侮\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　地主当了民兵队长  林里堡群众受欺侮\n    【冀南消息】成磁一区林里堡过去被认为是一区的模范村，其实地主还在横行。民兵队长郑保和是连送村的一个地主，用枪打了别人，就跑到林里堡给地主种地。成磁解放后，开展增资倒佃运动，他假装积极，当了民兵队长。群众叫他\"小老虎\"。从他上台，就成了群众头上的一块大石板。他办的坏事很多，主要的有：一、包庇地主。复查时他叫地主要饭装穷，他就造谣说：\"俺村斗彻底啦，地主都要饭哩！\"瞒哄上级和群众，其实斗争很不彻底。二、贪污浪费。他私自按户派了廿八万元的子弹款，中农拿二百，贫农拿一百，村干、民兵、恶棍三不拿。这钱他都贪污了。果实里有三十八棵大树，顶小的一棵就卖一万八千元，他也都贪污了。他还串通少数民兵，偷了果实里五个大包袱。过八月十五，强迫十家中农每家摊一万元，他和一伙村干都吃喝了。城里有这村地主的一处宅子，他私自卖了三十万，立时和民兵吃了一万，那二十九万买了一支三号盒子枪（当时十万就能买一支）。三、要流氓欺侮妇女，黑夜借口查户口，随便上门。四、强占果实。好东西都落到村干、民兵、恶棍手里，他自己光好漆嫁就分了二十多件。他的地都是近地、好地、井地，他却报出只有十五亩茅草地。分果实时他提着枪站在门口，指定叫你要啥就要啥，稍嫌坏嫌少，他就破口大骂。赤贫韩金容曾经反抗他这种霸道行为，被扣了两三回。赤贫石怀之经过几次斗争，就分了几件破缸、破箱、破柜。五、他带着农会村公所的公章，私自给当特务的曹连福老婆开路条，叫她上漳德去找曹连福。调查组到他村，他怕群众提他的错误，暗开群众大会说：\"清查班到咱村，不办好事，谁也不能给他说话，到谁家吃饭，不能叫他们吃饱。您不怕咱？走着瞧。\"贫农组织起来了，他说：\"这班家伙我根本尿不着。\"群众决定叫他坦白，在坦白大会上将他撤了职。"

    "content": "Huguan Comrades Zhao Liansheng and others expose\n　　Class status was arbitrarily assigned based on \"political\" conditions, and poor hired laborers have not yet been liberated\n    [Taihang News]: Zhao Liansheng and Gao Song, two comrades from the Huguan County government, wrote to the Taihang Xinhua Daily on the 13th of this month, exposing how cadres in Huangjiachuan \"incorrectly designated class status\" to oppress poor hired laborers, preventing them from turning over a new leaf. They proposed that all localities pay attention to investigating this serious problem. The letter stated: In Huangjiachuan, Second District of our county, the hired laborers who were originally shepherds are still treated as \"degraded middle peasants\" by the cadres. On January 20th, when inspecting the difficulties faced by the poor hired laborers in the village, it was discovered that three households, including Shui Ze, De Xi, and Bao Ze, had not had quilts to cover themselves throughout the winter. In particular, Niu Baoze had worked as a long-term laborer outside for fifty years. After these years of struggling for liberation, his family still had nothing, and the clothes he wore were the most ragged. At that time, he only had one dou of grain left. After writing about the above situation in the county's small newspaper, the political director of Huangjiachuan went to the female village head Haitang angrily and said: \"Let's remove ourselves from our positions! It's okay to say that Baoze and Dexi are poor hired laborers and haven't been taken care of, but Shui Ze is a degraded middle peasant, we can't take care of him!?\" Other cadres also talked nonsense like this. Later, after we carefully interviewed the village head, she said: \"Shui Ze started herding sheep at the age of eight, and his family was very poor. During the rent reduction movement, because he was not 'aware' and was too close to his landlord, Shui Ze was struggled against and beaten once. Is that why he was classified as a degraded middle peasant!?\" As a result of this misclassification, Shui Ze has not been able to turn over a new leaf in several movements of \"land to the tiller,\" and now he doesn't even have a room and is often bullied. This winter, throughout two to three months of winter production, he had no way to overcome the difficulties, and the cadres did not provide any solutions. We believe that it is unreasonable for poor hired laborers to have been oppressed in the past and still not be able to turn over a new leaf, suffering on both ends, and this should be corrected immediately. The reasons why some village cadres are acting so recklessly should also be investigated and studied. We think that similar situations may exist elsewhere, and the leadership should carefully investigate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 壶关赵连生等同志揭发  按\"政治\"条件乱划成份  贫雇水则如今没翻身\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　壶关赵连生等同志揭发\n　　按\"政治\"条件乱划成份  贫雇水则如今没翻身\n    【太行消息】：壶关县政府赵连生，高嵩两同志，本月十三日给太行新华日报写信，揭发黄家川干部\"错划成份\"来压迫雇贫水则翻不了身，提议各地注意检查这一严重问题。来信说：我县二区黄家川羊工出身的雇贫水则，至今干部仍以\"降中农\"苛待。上月二十日，检查该村雇贫困难，当时发现水则、得喜、保则等三户，冬天一直没有棉被盖。特别是牛保则，在外住了五十年长工，经过这几年闹翻身，家里还是啥也没有，穿的衣服最破烂，当时已只剩一斗粮。把上述事情写到县小报后，黄家川的政治主任即去找女村长海棠生气的说：\"咱自己撤职了咱自己吧！保则、得喜是贫雇，说没照顾到还可以，水则是个降中，咱不能照顾呀！？\"其它干部竟也这样瞎说。后来，据我们仔细访问了村长，她说：\"水则从八岁上就放羊，家里很贫苦。减租运动时，因他不'觉悟'，好给他东家（地主）接近，结果就把水则斗了一次，打了一顿。就这便划成他降中农啦！？\"这么错划的结果，使水则在耕者有其田好几次运动中，一直没翻身，现在连间房也没有，并经常受气。今冬整整两三个月的冬季生产中，困难没办法，干部也没给解决。我们认为：贫雇过去受压迫，现在还不能翻身，两头受苦，很不合理，应马上纠正。有些村干部为什么这样胡作非为，也应该考察研究。我们想：别处恐也有类似这样情形，领导上应仔细检查。"

    "content": "Most Landlords Indicate Submission\n　　Those Who Sabotage the Land Law Will Be Punished\n    Some landlords and rich peasants, upon hearing that they would receive the same share of land as the peasants, were very grateful to the Chinese Communist Party for pointing out a new path for them to be reborn and start anew. They were especially grateful for the peasants' leniency towards them. This proves that it is very necessary for the Land Law to allocate a share to landlords, so that they can survive on the path of labor and production. But there are also those who resist the Land Law. For example, Sun Fengwu, a landlord in Sunjia Slope, Neiqiu, said to Sun Wucheng, a new middle peasant: \"You see, those who have been struggled against are fine now, they are only talking about struggling against middle peasants!\" Liu Bozhen, a rich peasant in Xiaoling, Neiqiu, ate a ton of mutton and white flour every day in a restaurant in Mengjiaping after the Land Law was promulgated. Similar things have happened in some counties in Southern Hebei and Taiyue. They gave wine and grain to win over cadres and poor and hired peasants; and even assassinated poor and hired peasants. In Han Tong's family in Xiaozicun, Neiqiu, a rich peasant, there were eight brothers who separated after hearing about the Land Law. (Originally, one person was a major cadre in the village, so he was not thoroughly struggled against.) He Quanhuai, a landlord in Anyao, Zuoquan, said: \"Anyway, we can't survive, so eating is a real gain.\" He slaughtered a pig and the whole family ate it. These people's rumors, sabotage, and illegal acts of selling, transferring, and wasting property should be given a serious rebuttal and legal sanctions.\n    In some places, there are also individual bad elements who, because of conflicts with other people in the village, attempt to win over some people and take this opportunity to retaliate. For example, Cheng Shouku, a veteran in Dongliu Village, Cixian County, incited other veterans and families of soldiers to oppose the cadres. After the Land Law Outline came to the village, he said to Cheng Huaide, a middle peasant, on the street: \"There is a major land reform! If you are on my side, it will be fine.\" Such situations of distorting the Land Law in order to create sectarian disputes, win over people, and attack cadres should also be stopped, and they should be punished as sabotaging the Land Law.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大部地主表示低头　破坏土地法的要受到制裁\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大部地主表示低头\n　　破坏土地法的要受到制裁\n    地主富农中有的听到要与农民分到同样一份土地，十分感谢中国共产党指给他们新生，重新做人的一条大道，他们尤其感激农民对他们的宽大。证明土地法上分给地主一份，使他们能在劳动生产的道路上活下去，是非常必要的。也还有的抵抗土地法。如内邱孙家坡地主孙凤梧到新中农孙五成家里说：\"你看被斗户以后没事了，光说斗中农吧！\"内邱小岭的富农刘伯贞在土地法公布后，每天到孟家坪一个饭铺里吃一吨羊肉白面。冀南和太岳某些尤县份都有类似的事情发生。他们送酒送粮拉拢干部和贫雇；甚至暗杀贫雇农。内邱孝子村富农韩同家里弟兄八个，听到土地法后分了家。（原来有一个人当着村里主要干部，所以没斗透）左权安窑的地主何全换说：\"反正不能过了，吃了是实赚。\"杀了一口猪全家吃了。对这些人的造谣破坏和变卖转移浪费财物的非法行为，应给以严正的驳斥和法律的制裁。\n    还有些地方，有个别坏分子因为和村里另外一些人有矛盾，企图拉拢一些人，乘此机会报复。如磁县东六村荣誉军人程守库，挑动其他荣退军人和抗属反干部，土地法大纲到村后，他在街上给一个中农程怀德说：\"土地大改革哩！你如果跟我一股气，就不要紧了。\"象这种为了闹宗派纠纷，拉拢人攻击干部而曲解土地法的情形，也应该注意制止，要按破坏土地法来制裁他们。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: The Tianjin Daily reports: Tianjin's industrial crisis is deepening. Among the city's twelve match factories, none are operating at full capacity. Beiyang and other match factories have already announced closure due to unsustainable losses. Danhua Match Factory, a relatively large factory, produces only about 50 boxes per day, less than a quarter of its original output of 220 boxes. The rubber industry has 54 factories (three of which are operated by bureaucratic capitalists). More than ten factories closed successively during the sluggish period before last year, in June and October. The current production volume of the remaining factories has been reduced to one-tenth of that of the previous two years. Among Tianjin's more than 190 weaving and dyeing factories, many have applied for closure. The average output of cotton mills has decreased by more than one-third. Furthermore, in Zhangjiakou, under the criminal rule of the bandit Fu, as many as 129 businesses closed down last month, an average of more than four closures per day. These included 16 textile businesses, 13 department stores, 12 leather businesses, 10 flour businesses, 8 civil engineering businesses, 8 daily necessities businesses, 6 grocery stores, and 6 metal businesses.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to a compilation of news from Jiang-controlled newspapers last month: Under the occupation of the bandit Fu, prices in Zhangjiakou rose alarmingly last year. From the beginning of January last year to the beginning of January this year, the price of wheat increased 39 times, from 30,000 yuan per stone to 1.2 million yuan. The price of white flour increased 69 times, from 200 yuan per catty to 14,000 yuan. Ordinary white cloth also increased 13 times, from 125,000 yuan per bolt to 1.58 million yuan. Merchants were unable to repurchase the same amount of goods the next day with the proceeds from sales, leading to the bankruptcy of many stores. Under the heavy pressure of high prices, the general poor citizens were unable to make a living, and many impoverished people died of cold and hunger.\n\nIt is also reported: The people of Suiyuan are increasingly opposed to the bandit Fu. Since last winter, Chiang currency circulating in the market has often been found with anti-Chiang-Fu lyrics such as \"Donations and conscription, they want money and lives, the officials are all full, only the common people suffer.\" The Fu family bandit gang is extremely alarmed by this and has strictly ordered the prohibition of this practice in various places, but to no effect.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 天津工业停工减产　张垣商号倒闭一百二十九家\n\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　天津工业停工减产\n  　张垣商号倒闭一百二十九家\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】津报消息：天津工业危机日深。全市火柴业工厂共有十二家，除北洋等火厂柴已因不堪亏累近已宣布倒闭停工外，没有一家工厂能全部开工，规模较大之丹华火柴厂，每日产量五十余箱，仅及原有产量二百二十箱的四分之一弱。橡胶业共有五十四家（内有三家为官僚资本所经营），有十余家工厂已于年前六、十月不景气时期相继倒闭，现其余各厂生产量均已减缩到前两年的十分之一。津市一百九十余家织染业工厂，申请歇业者极多，其中棉织厂产量平均已减少达三分之一以上。另息：傅匪罪恶统治下之张家口，上月份商号倒闭达一百二十九家之多，平均每日倒闭四家以上，内包括纺织业十六家、百货业十三家、皮业十二家、面食业十家、土木工业八家、日用品业八家、杂货业六家、金属业六家。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】综合上月蒋区报纸消息：傅匪侵占下的张家口，去年一年物价上涨惊人。自去年一月初至今年一月初，小麦价格上涨三十九倍，由每石三万元涨至一百二十万元；白面上涨六十九倍，由每斤二百元涨至一万四千元；普通白布也上涨十三倍，由每匹十二万五千元涨至一百五十八万元。商人售货所得，第二天即无法购回同量货物，许多商店因此破产。一般贫苦市民在高物价重压下，根本无法生活，不少赤贫因冻饿而死。\n    另悉：绥远人民反傅匪情绪日增，自去冬以来，市面上流通之蒋币票面上常发现“捐款又抽丁，要钱又要命，官儿都刮饱，只苦老百姓”等反蒋傅歌词，傅家匪帮对此惊惶万状，严令各地查禁无效。"

    "content": "Most Cadres and Party Members Determined to Correct Mistakes, Accept People's Review, and Forever Stand with the Party\n    Good cadres all support the Land Law. A portion of cadres with poor work styles who had divided excessive fruits, due to their own errors and shortcomings, and unclear understanding of the Land Law, once had some resistance in their thinking, feeling fearful and uneasy. In Xiyang, individual village cadres privately hid newspapers, afraid to read the Land Law to the masses. Some, fearing they would have to return the excessively gained fruits, infringed upon the interests of the middle peasants, attempting to curry favor with the poor and hired peasants. Cadres in Xima Village, Shahe, emphasized \"following the poor and hired peasant line,\" wanting to completely confiscate the public shares contributed to the cooperatives during the movement and give them to the poor and hired peasants, and also requiring the sixty middle peasant households to contribute all 2,600 jin of grain for teachers' salaries and cadre travel expenses. Wu Cai’gui, the director of the peasant association in Houlinhe Village, Wu’an, was a wealthy middle peasant who had turned over well. Fearing that he would have to return too many fruits, he sent two bundles of clothes and some millet and corn to his sisters' homes in Yuewei Township. He also sold many items, ground white flour, and bought rice noodles, feasting every day, saying: \"I'll live it up one day at a time.\" In Yiren Village, Neiqiu, cadre Li Jichun (political director), upon hearing about the Land Law in the district, returned to the village and removed the barbed wire from his house, selling it for 50,000 yuan, and also sold a large locust tree. Some cadres, using the excuse of disagreeing with giving landlords a share, resisted the Land Law, unwilling to return the excessively gained fruits. For example, cadres in Dongguan Village, Heshun, said: \"Giving the landlords a share is simply going backwards.\" In Shili Village, Wu'an, the director of the Military Affairs Committee said: \"Dividing land to the landlords is us making peace with the landlords.\" The broad masses of peasants rose up to criticize this statement as incorrect, saying: \"Equal land distribution is beneficial to the peasants, for the sake of everyone's permanent liberation. Cadres should support the Land Law and implement the Party's policies, and not have bad intentions, trying to avoid returning the excessively gained fruits.\" Many honest village cadres and Party members supported the Land Law and were willing to return the excessively occupied fruits, standing with the poor and hired peasants. For example, the militia captain from a poor peasant background in Houlinhe Village, Wu'an, confessed that during the June movement last year, he and the director of the peasant association and the political director stole fruits, quilts, and clothes. When the comrades of the Nanmen Street General Branch in Chengguan District, Xiangyuan, conducted a self-examination, the political director and the street leader said: \"I used to be poor too, but after becoming a cadre, I forgot the poor and hired peasants and left them.\" They have already begun to actively help the poor and hired peasants with production.\n\n    From the above situation, it can be seen that the broad masses of cadres and Party members, through the education and supervision of the Party and the masses, support the Land Law. Of course, we should pay attention to landlords, rich peasants, and hooligans who have infiltrated the Party to spread rumors and sabotage. These people should be immediately expelled from the Party, removed from their positions, and reviewed by the masses. For Party members and cadres of peasant origin, we must enlighten their consciousness, encourage them to reflect on their forgetting-their-roots thinking, educate them to return to the workers' and peasants' standpoint, accept the review of the masses, and implement the Land Law together with the peasants. Strive to become good hired laborers of the people in this movement. In some places, simply detaining people from above is not the solution. We must believe that the masses have the power to educate them. Even if the \"masses\" demand \"detention,\" we must examine whether it is truly the opinion of the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 干部党员大多数决心改过  接受人民审查永远和党一道\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　干部党员大多数决心改过  接受人民审查永远和党一道\n    好干部都是拥护土地法的。一部分多分果实作风不好的干部，自己有了错误和缺点，对土地法又认识不清，思想上曾经有些抵抗，恐惧不安。昔阳有个别村干私藏报纸，不敢给群众念土地法。还有的怕自己多得的果实要拿出来，就侵害中农利益，向贫雇买好。沙河西马庄干部强调\"走贫雇路线\"，要把合作社在运动中入的公股完全没收归贫雇，派教员薪金和干部支差米两千六百斤，也完全叫六十户中农拿出来。武安后林河村农会主任武才贵是富裕中农，翻身很高，怕退多占果实，就把两包袱衣服和黍籽、玉茭一部分送到岳未乡他姊妹家，又卖了好多东西，磨了白面，买上大米粉条，天天大吃，说：\"过了一天算一天。\"内邱诣仁村干部李吉春（政治主任）在区里听到土地法，回村就把自己分的房子上的铁丝网摘下，卖了五万元，又卖了一棵大槐树。一部分干部借口不同意给地主分一份抵抗土地法，不想退出多得果实。如和顺东关村干部说：\"给地主一份，简直是倒算。\"武安十里店，武委会主任说：\"分土地给地主是咱们跟地主讲和了。\"广大农民都起来批评这种说法不对，他们说：\"平分土地是对农民有利，为了大家永久翻身，干部更应拥护土地法，执行党的政策，不要想些坏心思，逃避退出多得果实\"。很多老老实实的村干党员，都拥护土地法，愿意退出多占果实，和贫雇农民站在一道。如武安后林河贫雇出身的民兵队长，谈出他在去年六月运动中，和农会主任、政治主任一同偷了果实被子衣服。襄垣城关区南门街全支部的同志进行检查时，政治主任和街长说：\"我从前也是穷人，当了干部就忘了贫雇，离开了贫雇。\"他们已开始积极帮助贫雇生产。\n    从以上情形看，广大的干部和党员，经过党和群众的教育和监督，是拥护土地法的。当然我们应该注意有些地主分子、富农分子、流氓分子钻进党内造谣破坏，这些人应一律停止党籍，撤销职务，由群众审查。对农民出身的党员和干部，要启发他们觉悟，反省忘本思想，教育他们回到工农立场上来，接受群众的审查，和农民一道实行土地法。争取在这次运动中当个人民的好长工。有些地方单纯由上而下的扣押也不是办法，要相信群众有力量教育他们。就是\"群众\"要求\"扣\"，也要审办是不是真正群众的意见。"

    "content": "To the Editors of the People's Daily:\n\n　　Nanzhuang Village, Fifth District of Wu'an\n  　Middle Peasants Unravel Ideological Knots\n  　Focus on Production Without Listening to Rumors\n\n　　Wang Kao, of Sinanzhuang Village, in our district, was born a poor worker making earthenware basins. Since the July 7th Incident, he has developed into a middle peasant through his labor. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, his wife went to Jinggou Village to visit relatives, where she met Hao Xishu, the wife of Bai Wu, a local landlord, who said to her: \"The newspaper says that land will be equally divided, and landlords will also get a share. In the past, the landlords were struggled against, and now the poor fellows have been filled up. Now, the middle peasants will be struggled against to fill up us landlords. When the land is divided equally, the poor fellows won't have the knowledge to do it, so they will still have to call on us landlords to do it, to be cadres, and participate in the equal division.\" After Wang Kao's wife heard what the landlord's wife said, she stopped spinning the four jin of cotton she had planned to spin before the new year to weave cloth for spring. She also ground a half dou of wheat and bought several jin of noodles to eat.\n\n　　When someone from this village was buried in Zhongzhai, a theatrical performance was put on. Wang Maizhuang, a public security member from Changzhai Village, sold peanut candy in his village. Wang Maizhuang knew Wang Kao, so he went to his house to visit him. Wang Kao's wife cooked for him (noodles in soup). He was usually very frugal, so Wang Maizhuang asked him why he bought noodles. He replied: \"It's not, just eat some, I don't know if we can make it through.\" Wang Maizhuang saw that his speech was knotty, so he asked him why he said that. At first, he didn't dare to say, but after talking about other things, he finally told him about hearing the landlord say that land would be divided equally, middle peasants would be struggled against to give to the landlords, and that he was not spinning cotton, grinding flour, buying noodles, was afraid, and had no heart to produce, etc. Wang Maizhuang then explained that the equal division talked about in the newspaper was to meet the demands of the poor and hired peasants, and that even though landlords would get a share, it would not be better than the poor and hired peasants, and that lower-middle peasants would get the fruits of the land, middle peasants would not be dug into, and rich middle peasants would voluntarily give up some land through consultation, otherwise concessions would be made, and that houses and floating wealth would not be touched. He also explained that class division was for the purpose of distinguishing between themselves and the landlords and rich peasants, so how could they be allowed to be cadres? He told him to focus on production and not listen to rumors, or he would suffer. After talking like this, he said that he understood and was not afraid anymore. When the cadres of Nanzhuang Village found out, they seized the winter study education to untie these ideological knots.\n\n　　The public security member from Changzhai also wrote a letter to the cadres of Jinggou Village to explain this matter. Jinggou Village immediately called a mass meeting to have the wife of the landlord Bai Wu explain the matter. At first, she didn't say, but after being urged by the masses, she finally said the matter. She also said that she had told an anti-Japanese soldier's family (who had earned some money this year by burning pots outside and bought grain) in Jinggou Village: \"You should eat and drink for a few days, or it will be divided equally.\" The anti-Japanese soldier's family knew she was spreading rumors and didn't listen to her. She also said this. The masses asked her who she heard it from, and she said that her husband, Bai Wu, told her. Bai Wu was called in, and he also admitted it. When asked who he heard it from, Bai Wu said he heard it from people on the road. The village chief also used this opportunity to educate the middle peasants at the meeting, telling them not to be afraid, to focus on production, and not to listen to the landlords' rumors.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　(Fifth District of Wu'an County, Zhengtang, Shuangjin, Xiatian)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 武安五区南庄村　中农解开思想圪＠　不听谣言安心生产\n正堂　双金　夏田\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　武安五区南庄村\n  　中农解开思想圪＠\n  　不听谣言安心生产人民日报编辑同志：\n    本区下到寺南庄村王考的，出身是个贫苦烧瓦盆工人，七七事变后靠劳动到现在发展成中农。土地法大纲公布后，他妻上井沟娘嫁探亲，遇邻家大地主白五的妻叫郝喜书，对她说：“报上登土地要平分，地主也同样一份，过去斗了地主填了穷小子们，现在要斗中农填我地主。平分时穷小子们没知识干不了，还得叫我地主干，当干部，参加平分。”王考的之妻听了地主妻这活，回到家后，家有四斤花想在年前纺了春暖织成布，听到这话把纺车放到驴圈不纺了。并磨斗半麦籽，还买几斤挂面吃。\n    此村中寨埋人演剧，常寨村公安员名叫王买庄，上他村卖花生糖，王买庄与王考的认识，到此村去他家看望，玉考的妻与他做饭（下挂面汤吃），他本来很省俭，王买庄便问你买挂面瞧谁哩。他答：不是，吃点吧，不知能不能过哩哟。王买庄他看说话有圪＠，便问他为啥这样说，起初问他不敢说，后从其它扯起话，他才将听地主说平分地，斗争中农给地主，和它不纺花、磨面买挂面吃、害怕、没心生产等等谈了一遍。王买庄便将报上所谈的平分是满足贫雇要求，与地主虽有一份，不能比贫雇强，和那下中农得果实，中农不挖去，富裕中农协商方式自愿出点地，否则让步，说明房子浮财不动。并划阶级，为了和地富分清家，那还能叫他当干部呢。你好好安心生产，不要听它造谣，不然吃亏。这样的谈了一遍，他才说这样那我就通了，不害怕了。南庄村干部知道，就抓紧冬学教育，解这思想圪＠。\n    常寨公安员又写信给井沟村干部说明这事情，井沟村马上召集群众叫地主白五的妻到会场说这件事，她最初不说，后经群众催促，她才将这事情说了。另将她在井沟村与一个翻身户抗属家庭（今年在外烧盆赚了些款买成粮）说：你快吃喝两天吧，不然也要平分，这抗属知道她是造谣，没听她。这事她也说了出来。群众问他是听谁说的，说是她男人白五的给她说。叫她男人白五的，他也承认了。问他听谁说，白五的说是他在路上听人家说。村长同时在会场将此事教育了中农，不要害怕，好好生产，莫听地主的造谣。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　（武安县第五区、正堂、双金、夏田）"

    "content": "Column:\n\n　　Why Don't Some District and Village Cadres in Qinyuan\n  　Promote the Land Law?\n    We welcome comrades from all over the border region who are participating in the land redistribution work to exchange work situations, exchange work opinions, study work problems, and concentrate opinions from various aspects and then solve them together with the greatest amount of space. Whether it is systematic or fragmented, whether it is materials or experiences; whether it is in the form of writing articles, writing letters, or writing newsletters and diaries, any form is good, just write down what you want to say; don't use Party jargon and empty talk. Other comrades who have different opinions can also write letters to discuss. Each place has its own specific circumstances, and the communications published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for everyone's reference. People's Daily Editors:\n    (1) After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, we wanted to read it to the masses in the winter school in our village (Qinyuan ××× Village), but the chairman of the Joint Association, Qin Xuanwen, strongly disagreed and forbade it. He said: He was afraid that the middle peasants would eat and drink too much and not be good, waste production, and that poor hired laborers would not accumulate fertilizer and charcoal, save money, and not work hard and wait! He also said, \"This is the instruction from the district, don't let the hired poor know.\" He also said to the cadres: \"If the hired poor are read the land law, the hired poor will run ahead of the cadres, it will not be too late to read it during the land reform.\" (In fact, it is an idea to fool the people, afraid that the hired poor will know the land law and not be under his command.)\n    The next day, we resolutely read the Outline Land Law to the masses in detail in the winter school. The hired poor were especially happy and listened with great interest. There was silence when reading the newspaper. After reading it, everyone quarreled: Some said, this is good, we can also share a good piece of land and live in a good house. Some said: If this is done, the good fruits cannot only be divided by the cadres, and gold and silver treasures must also be divided to us a little bit! Some said: If it weren't for Comrade Ersuo reading it to us, we would still be pressed under the stone slab. We will have a basis for speaking in the future, and we will no longer be manipulated by others! The hired laborer Wang Si'er said indignantly: I must kowtow to Chairman Mao when I see him, he knows our suffering so clearly!\n    The next day, more people came to the winter school, and the mood was extremely high. Even the old man who never spoke usually spoke.\n    Then the hired laborer Wang Si'er made a suggestion to Qin Xuanwen, the chairman of the Joint Association: \"In the past, when fighting Qin Yun, my fruits should be more than yours. Why did you give me millet at that time, and you gave me an iron rod, a paper incense burner, and two mu of land? You took one mu of good land and gave me one mu of rotten land that was far away and not good.\" Qin Xuanwen was speechless. The next day, the hired poor chatted together and said: \"Who would dare to give others this opinion in the past? If people said they would give you my family, they would not dare to say anything even if they suffered a loss. At the same time, they mentioned that Guan Hanwen, a cadre from the county's political office, sold three mu of bad land in Donggou to the iron worker Li Changsheng for a high price of three stone of millet. Last spring, he proposed to divide the fruits again, and as a result, he took away one mu of good land rented by Wang Youcai and divided it to him. Wang Youcai was very dissatisfied at the time, but he didn't dare to say anything.\n    After that, we also met with Qin Genshuan, the village chief and chairman of the Farmers Association, and summoned all the hired poor in the administrative village to give detailed publicity and explanation on the Outline Land Law, supplementary measures, the letter to farmers, the letter to party members, and all the articles in the New Masses. Although it was only two afternoons, it played a great role. The hired poor are more united, which is specifically manifested in borrowing wheat for the New Year, giving way to each other, taking care of each other, and exposing the conspiracy to fill a family's hole with eight stone of wheat and destroy the unity of the hired poor (individual bad cadres advocated this and actively carried out activities). The hired poor Li Genhong said: \"This is like a family.\" And pay attention to uniting the middle peasants, explain the land law to the middle peasants, so the phenomenon that individual middle peasants who like to eat and drink and are not frugal has also changed now. The hired poor are more active in labor, and are now working hard to accumulate charcoal to prepare for the New Year's entertainment.\n    The first time I read the land law, Qin Xuanwen, the chairman of the Joint Association, said this because he was not satisfied with doing so: The hired poor are discouraged when they hear that the landlord is going to be divided the land, and they have no confidence in the struggle, and the middle peasants eat and drink too much and do not work hard. After investigation, there is no such phenomenon so far, and he said these are fabricated.\n    The hired poor on the mountain want to move to the village to live, because the land on the mountain is too bad, and there is no harvest in drought. Usually rabbits, raccoon dogs (mountain rats), and pheasants cannot be resisted. The hired poor said: Can't we go back to the village and divide a good piece of land?\n    (2) According to reports, the Central Bureau instructed that the Land Law should be well publicized in the New Year's entertainment, and the instructions of the troops system are also the same, but the district office instructs the villages to only publicize \"three accumulations\" and \"production\", and not to publicize the Land Law.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th—According to disclosures from various sources, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit authorities are now preparing to auction off mining, industrial, and transportation sovereignty in South and Southwest China, in order to further turn these two regions into colonies of American imperialism. On the 13th of this month, Gu Yuzhu, deputy secretary-general of the Chiang Kai-shek National Economic Commission, admitted that Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun had ordered that \"all conveniences be given to foreign (American) businessmen in China,\" and that the commission had been ordered to invite relevant departments of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to draft \"new regulations\" to \"welcome\" foreign (American) private capital. These regulations will allow foreign (American) capital to directly invest in establishing factories and companies in China. At the end of December of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek Economic Department drafted a geological survey and exploration plan for mines in Sichuan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Anhui, Taiwan, and the Xisha Islands. In the middle of last month, Sun Yueqi, deputy director of the Chiang Kai-shek Resources Committee, went to Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to inspect mining and industrial enterprises. On the 27th of last month, Weng Wenhao, director of the Chiang Kai-shek Resources Committee, and Song Ziwen, chairman of the Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Province, issued a joint statement stating that they would fully develop Guangdong's electricity, coal mines, sugar industry, and Hainan Island's iron ore, which have been designated as investment targets for American imperialism. Hu Shanheng, director of the Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction, also went to Changsha on the 27th of last month to discuss \"Hunan-Guangdong economic cooperation issues\" with the Chiang Kai-shek Hunan authorities. The Chiang Kai-shek Jiangxi Provincial Government announced a \"Jiangxi Industrialization\" plan on the 29th of last month, listing the hemp textile factory, dyeing textile factory, hemp embroidery factory, oil pressing factory, sugar factory, tea factory, sawmill, cement factory, and machine-made brick and tile factory belonging to the province's state-owned Xingye Company as American investment targets. On the 28th of last month, He Guoguang, deputy director of the Chiang Kai-shek Chongqing Headquarters, announced a \"Sichuan-Kangding-Yunnan Border Development Plan,\" deciding to establish a \"Sichuan-Kangding-Yunnan Border Affairs Committee\" to be responsible for the investigation and development of industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and transportation in the area. This area is the Daliang Mountains region, which the American military had already conducted detailed surveys for the purpose of military and economic aggression against China. In addition, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are planning to use the method of developing \"business relations\" with Tibet to assist American economic forces in invading Tibet. It is reported that the Tibetan business delegation that arrived in Nanjing at the end of last month to discuss \"business\" issues with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits was the result of American and Chiang Kai-shek exerting pressure on Tibet.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝攫夺华南等地工矿交通 蒋匪准备大规模出卖主权\n\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝攫夺华南等地工矿交通  蒋匪准备大规模出卖主权\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】据各方消息披露：蒋匪当局现正准备大规模拍卖华南与中国西南工矿及交通主权，以便将该两地区进一步变为美帝殖民地。本月十三日，蒋匪全国经济委员会副秘书长顾毓珠瑔供认：蒋匪行政院长张群已下令“对外（美）国在华商人给予一切便利”，该会已奉命邀请蒋匪各有关各部门拟订“欢迎”外（美）国私人资本的“新法规”，该法规将允外（美）国资本直接投资在华设立工厂和公司。年前十二月下旬，蒋匪经济部即拟定一川、桂、赣、皖、台湾及西沙群岛等地的工矿地质调查勘察计划。上月中旬，蒋匪资委会副委员长孙越崎复赴湘、赣、粤考察工矿事业。上月二十七日蒋匪资委会委员长翁文灏与蒋匪粤省主席宋子文发表联合声明，表示将全力发展已规定为美帝投资对象之粤省电力、煤矿、糖业、和海南岛铁矿。蒋匪粤省建设厅长胡善恒并于上月二十七日赴长沙与蒋匪湘当局商讨“湘粤经济合作问题”。蒋匪江西省府上月二十九日发表“江西工业化”计划，开列该省官营兴业公司所属麻纺织厂、染纺织厂、麻绣厂、榨油厂、制糖厂、制茶厂、锯木厂、水泥厂及机制砖瓦厂，作为美国投资对象。上月二十八日蒋匪重庆行辕副主任贺国光复公布一项“川、康、滇边开发计划”，决定设立一“川、康、滇边务委员会”，负责该地区工、矿、农林、畜牧及交通等项调查和开发，该地即系美军为军事及经济侵华目的所早已进行详细勘测之大凉山区域。此外，蒋匪正打算利用与西藏发展“商务关系”的办法，协助美国经济势力侵入西藏。据悉，上月下旬抵达南京与蒋匪商讨“商务”问题的西藏商务代表团，即系美蒋向西藏实行压力的结果。"

    "content": "Chiang Kai-shek's Financial Crisis\n    The large-scale counter-offensive by the People's Liberation Army and the further impoverishment, bankruptcy, and starvation of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas under the oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek's four big families have created an unprecedented crisis in the Chiang bandit's finances.\n\n    In terms of expenditures, the Chiang bandit's internal currency and grain expenditures, as well as foreign exchange expenditures for purchasing military supplies, have increased sharply.\n\n    In terms of currency expenditures, the Chiang bandit openly announced a full-year budget of over 9.3 trillion yuan for 1947 (this budget was based on the price level of September of the previous year and was deliberately reduced in various ways; if calculated based on the price level of December of the previous year, it should be listed as 30 trillion yuan). However, according to various sources, the actual expenditure last year increased month by month with rising prices, with the total expenditure for the first four months reaching 14 trillion yuan, increasing to 12 trillion yuan in October alone, and further increasing to over 16 trillion yuan in December; based on the above situation, the Chiang bandit's actual currency expenditure for the entire year last year was approximately 100 trillion yuan. Judging from the relationship between the rate of price increases and the increase in financial expenditure in previous years (from 1945 to 1946, Chiang bandit's prices rose by about five times annually, and actual expenditure often exceeded the budget by five times), last year's price increase was more than twelve times, and the Chiang bandit's actual expenditure was at least five times the actual budget, i.e., 150 trillion yuan, exceeding 150 trillion yuan.\n\n    On January 9 this year, the Chiang bandit announced a budget of over 96 trillion Chiang currency for currency expenditure in the first half of 1948. Based on the situation in previous years, the actual expenditure is often about five times the budget, then the Chiang bandit's actual currency expenditure this year will reach the astronomical figure of over 10 quadrillion yuan.\n\n    In terms of grain expenditure: according to the Chiang bandit army's supply standard of 24 taels of rice per person per day, the Chiang bandit's more than 4 million military personnel needed a total of 40 million dan of rice last year. In 1948, due to the Chiang bandit's announcement that, starting from February, each \"central\" level public employee of the Chiang regime would be allocated 3 dou of rice per month, and technicians and laborers 2 dou of rice, it is estimated that this will increase the expenditure of 5 million to 10 million dan of rice, totaling between 45 million and 50 million dan of rice for the whole year.\n\n    The foreign exchange expenditure for purchasing military supplies: last year alone, the foreign exchange used by the Chiang bandit's Resources Committee exceeded 130 million US dollars, not including the US imperialists and their running dogs, Canada, transferring war materials and loans to purchase military supplies. In 1948, due to the fact that the war materials obtained by the Chiang bandits from the US imperialists and the Japanese army have been largely consumed, their foreign purchasing expenditure will increase rather than decrease.\n\n    In contrast to the increasing expenditure year by year, the actual value of the Chiang bandit's normal income decreases year by year, resulting in an increasing financial deficit.\n\n    The Chiang bandit's budget for last year, including 400 million US dollars of public bonds and treasury bonds, totaled 122 trillion yuan. According to the Chiang bandit's announced actual receipts, tax revenue was 9 trillion, non-tax revenue was over 2.8 trillion, and the sale of US dollar public bonds and treasury bonds was 1.3 trillion, totaling 13 trillion yuan for the whole year, with a currency deficit of about 90 percent.\n\n    The Chiang bandit's budget for currency income in the first half of 1948 was listed as 58 trillion yuan in order to conceal the disparity between income and expenditure, but according to Lou Tongsun, acting secretary-general of the Chiang bandit's Legislative Yuan, on the 7th of this month: it is expected that the actual income will not exceed 60 percent of this number, i.e., 35 trillion yuan. He also revealed that the war expenses and \"transportation expenses\" and so-called \"construction expenses,\" which account for more than 80 percent of the total expenditure, are all without funding. Based on this estimate, the actual currency income for the whole year is unlikely to reach 100 trillion yuan, and the Chiang bandit's currency deficit this year will exceed 90 percent.\n\n    In terms of grain income, the total amount of grain collected and borrowed in 1947 (including the local level) was 64.77 million dan (according to the Shanghai Dagongbao on December 8 last year, wheat and sorghum have been converted into rice), and the actual collection was only about 70% of the quota. The Chiang bandit central government actually obtained 25.63 million dan of rice, with a grain deficit of more than 30%. This year, the Chiang bandit's quota for collection and borrowing has increased to 80 million dan of rice, and 10 million dan of military grain will be purchased in Sichuan and Hunan. The Chiang bandit central government expects to receive 50 million dan, but as the peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas become increasingly bankrupt and resist, and the People's Liberation Army launches a victorious offensive, the Chiang bandit's actual grain collection will be far lower than this number, and the grain deficit will increase even more.\n\n    In terms of foreign payments, in last year's international payment items in the Chiang-controlled areas, the normal trade deficit was over 220 million US dollars; the smuggling deficit was at least 100 million US dollars according to the lowest estimate by the Beijing \"Zheng Lun\" magazine, which is related to the Chiang bandit's officialdom; repayment of foreign debt principal and interest was 45 million US dollars; the Chiang bandit government's expenses for personnel stationed abroad were approximately 65 million US dollars; and the profits and interest of foreign-owned enterprises in China were at least 50 million US dollars. The above totals over 480 million US dollars. Under the income item, remittances from overseas Chinese have been drastically reduced to less than 50 million US dollars; the expenses of foreigners in the Chiang-controlled areas are approximately 50 million US dollars; and the Chiang bandit's previous sales of surplus US-transferred materials are approximately 100 million US dollars. The total income is less than 200 million US dollars, with a deficit of over 280 million US dollars. Adding the Chiang bandit's foreign war expenses of 130 million US dollars last year, this deficit is further aggravated and increased to over 410 million US dollars. According to the figures released by Zhu Qi, a senior official of the Chiang bandit's Ministry of Finance, the Chiang bandit's monthly international balance of payments deficit last year was 36 million US dollars, then the total deficit for the whole year last year was 432 million US dollars, which is very close to our estimate above. This situation will develop further in 1948.\n\n    The only way for the Chiang bandit to make up for the increasing currency deficit year by year is to exploit the people by issuing banknotes indiscriminately; before the Chinese New Year, the amount of Chiang currency issued has exceeded 100 trillion yuan, which is ten times higher than the amount issued at the end of the previous year. The four big families have made a fortune from inflation and rising prices, turning the sweat and blood of the vast majority of people in the Chiang-controlled areas into the private property of the four big families. This situation has directly caused starvation among the working people in the Chiang-controlled areas and the bankruptcy of national industries. In December last year, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau of the Chiang bandit announced that the workers' cost of living index was only 68,000 times, less than half of the price index for that month. And millions of soldiers and public employees in the Chiang bandit regime have also fallen into a state of starvation. Industrial and commercial enterprises have gone bankrupt and closed down one after another.\n\n    The Chiang bandit's annually increasing grain collection, purchases, requisition and local apportionment is the extra feudal land rent extracted by the Chiang bandit's state monopoly capital group from the peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas, thus draining the fat and blood of the peasants in the Chiang-controlled areas. The burden on self-cultivating farmers in the Chiang-controlled areas usually reaches 65% to 80%, while tenants, in addition to paying landlords more than 50% of their annual income as rent, usually have to pay 15% to 20% of their annual income as apportionment. In the Chiang-occupied areas of eastern Hebei, northern Henan, and Liaoning, farmers have exhausted all their possessions and still cannot pay the taxes and apportionments of the Chiang bandits. Another result is that agricultural cultivation is becoming increasingly extensive, farmland water conservancy is in disrepair, and more and more land is abandoned (before the Chinese New Year, it had exceeded 50 million mu). As a result, agricultural production in the Chiang-controlled areas has plummeted. In 1947, the rice harvest was 33% lower than in normal pre-war years, the wheat harvest was 40% lower, and other miscellaneous grains such as sorghum and sweet potatoes were reduced by more than 30%. Compared with the minimum demand, the grain production in the Chiang-controlled areas last year before this year's harvest was short of 3 million metric tons of rice (equivalent to 60 million dan) and 2.8 million metric tons of wheat (equivalent to about 56 million dan), foreshadowing a serious famine threatening the survival of millions of people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The people's movements of resisting grain, resisting conscription, and begging for food in the Chiang-controlled areas will develop more widely on this basis.\n\n    Finally, due to the development of the Chiang bandit's foreign payment deficit and international balance of payments deficit, a crisis of foreign exchange exhaustion has been created for the Chiang bandit. The Chiang bandit is even more unconditionally relying on the US imperialist's blood transfusion and is even more recklessly selling out national sovereignty. Currently, the Chiang bandit is begging his Wall Street masters for loans to save his life through the compradors and traitors Kong Xiangxi and Bei Zuyi, but the facts of the past two years have proved that US imperialist aid cannot save Chiang Kai-shek, who is increasingly sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Telegram)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石的财政危机\n\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋介石的财政危机\n    由于人民解放军大举反攻以及蒋匪四大家族压榨下蒋区人民进一步贫困、破产、饥饿的发展，就造成了目前蒋匪财政前所未见的危机。\n    在岁出部门中，蒋匪对内的货币支出和粮食支出，以及对外购买军火的外币支出，均急剧膨胀。\n    货币支出方面，一九四七年度蒋匪公开宣布的全年预算为九万三千余亿元（该项预算是以前年九月物价为准且故意多方削减而做出的，如以前年十二月物价水准来计算，应列为三十万亿元）。但据各消息透露去年实际支出：随着物价上涨逐月增加，头四个月的支出共达十四万亿元，十月份一个月已增为十二万亿元，十二月份更增为十六万亿元以上；根据上述情形统计，去年全年蒋匪货币实支约为一百万亿元左右。若从历年物价上涨速度与财政支出增加的关系来看（一九四五至四六年蒋匪物价每年上涨五倍上下，而实支常超过岁出预算五倍），去年度物价上涨为十二倍以上，蒋匪实支至少为实际预算即上述三十万亿元之五倍，即超过一百五十万亿元。\n    蒋匪于今年一月九日公布一九四八年上半年货币支出预算为蒋币九十六万余亿元，根据历年情况，实支常超出岁出预算五倍左右计，那么今年蒋匪货币实支将达一千万亿元以上之天文学数字。\n    粮食支出方面：按蒋匪军队供给标准每人每天二十四两大米计算，蒋匪军事人员四百多万，去年一年共需稻谷四千万担。一九四八年，由于蒋匪宣布自二月份起，配给蒋政权“中央”级公教人员每人每月三斗米，技工及工役二斗米，估计将增加五百万至一千万担稻谷的支出，合计全年稻谷支出共需四千五百万到五千万担之间。\n    购买军火的外币支出，去年一年仅蒋匪资源委员会所用外汇即超过一亿三千万元，美帝及其走狗加拿大移让作战物资及贷款购买军火数字尚不在内。一九四八年，由于蒋匪得自美帝及日军的作战物资已消耗大部，其对外购买支出将有增无减。\n    与支出逐年膨胀情形相反，蒋匪正常收入实值则逐年减少，其结果就造成了财政赤字日益增大。\n    蒋匪去年岁入预算连四亿元美金公债及库券在内，合计十二万二千亿元。据蒋匪宣布实收情形，税收九万亿，税外收入二万八千余亿，出卖美金公债库券一万三千亿，合计全年实收为十三万亿元，货币赤字约达百分之九十左右。\n    蒋匪一九四八年上半年货币收入预算，为了掩饰收支悬殊情形起见，列为五十八万亿元，但据蒋匪立法院代理秘书长楼桐荪本月七日供认：预料实际收入不会超过此数百分之六十，即三十五万亿元。并透露：占全部岁出百分之八十以上的战费及“交通费”与所谓“建设费”等皆全无着落。据此估计，今年全年货币实收难望达到一百万亿元，蒋匪今年货币赤字将超过百分之九十。\n    粮食收入方面，一九四七年田赋征实及征借配额（包括地方一级）共为稻谷六千四百七十七万市担（据去年十二月八日沪大公报，小麦及高粱均已折合稻谷），实收仅约为配额七成，蒋匪中央政府计实得稻谷二千五百六十三万市担，粮食赤字为百分之三十以上。今年度蒋匪征实征借配额竟增为稻谷八千万市担，在四川及两湖收购军粮一千万担，蒋匪中央政府预计分得五千万担，但随着蒋区农民日益破产与反抗，以及人民解放军的胜利进攻，蒋匪粮食实收将远低于此数，粮食赤字将更增大。\n    对外支付方面，在去年蒋区的国际支付项目中，正常贸易入超为二亿二千余万美元；走私入超据与蒋匪官方有关的北平“正论”杂志的最低估计数字为一亿美元；偿付外债本息四千五百万美元；蒋匪政府驻外人员费用约为六千五百万美元；外人在华企业利润，及利息至少为五千万美元。以上合计为四亿八千万美元以上。收入项下华侨汇款已激减为不足五千万美元；外人在蒋区费用约为五千万美元；蒋匪历次出售美国移让剩余物资约为一亿美元，以上合计全部收入不足二亿美元，收支逆差在二亿八千万美元以上。再加去年蒋匪对外战费一亿三千万美元，就使这种逆差更加恶化，而增为四亿一千万美元以上。另据蒋匪财政部一高级官员朱契所发表数字，去年蒋匪每个月国际收支逆差为三千六百万美元，则去年全年收支逆差共为四亿三千二百万美元，与我们上面估计的数字极为接近。一九四八年此种情况将更为发展。\n    蒋匪弥补逐年增大的货币赤字的唯一办法，就是用滥发纸币的办法剥削人民；年前为止，蒋币发行额已超过一百万亿元，较之前年底发行额高了十倍。四大家族从通货膨胀物价高涨中大发其财，使广大蒋区人民的血汗化为四大家族的私产。这种情形，就直接造成了蒋区劳动人民的饥饿，民族工业的破产。去年十二月蒋匪上海市社会局公布的工人生活指数仅为六万八千倍，不及该月物价指数的一半。而蒋匪政权机构中数百万的士兵及公教人员，亦已陷于饥饿状态。工商业则纷纷破产停业。\n    蒋匪逐年增加的征粮、抢购、征发及地方摊派，就是蒋匪国家垄断资本集团向蒋区农民榨取的额外封建地租，因而吸干了蒋区农民的脂血。蒋区自耕农民负担通常达到百分之六十五至八十，而佃农在以全年收入百分之五十以上交付地主的地租外，通常还要交纳全年收入百分之十五至二十的摊派负担。在冀东、豫北、辽宁蒋占区，农民罄尽所有，还不够交纳蒋匪赋税摊派。其另一结果就是：农业耕作日益粗放，农田水利陷于废弛，土地抛荒日多（年前已超过五千万亩），于是蒋区农业生产激降，一九四七年，稻谷收成较战前正常年份减少了三成三，小麦减少四成，其他高粱，蕃薯等项杂粮均减收三成以上。去年蒋区粮产与最低需要量比较，到今年收获期之前，稻谷不足三百万公吨（合六千万担），小麦不足二百八十万公吨（约合五千六百万担），预示着威胁蒋区千百万人民生存的严重粮荒就在眼前。蒋管区人民抗粮抗丁要饭吃的民变运动，将在这一基础上更广泛发展起来。\n    最后，由于蒋匪对外支付赤字与国际收支逆差的发展，造成了蒋匪外汇枯竭的危机。蒋匪已更加无条件地仰仗美帝的输血，与更加放肆地出卖国家主权。目前蒋匪正经由大买办及卖国贼孔祥熙、贝祖诒，向其华尔街的主子乞求贷款救命，但是两年来的事实证明美帝的援助是救不了泥沼中愈陷愈深的蒋介石的。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社陕北电）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 15th: According to various sources, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities' full-scale monopoly of cotton yarn and cloth in all Chiang-controlled areas has begun to be gradually implemented this month. The \"National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee,\" established by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits last month, has forcibly ordered cotton merchants in the Chiang-occupied cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to sell all their cotton stocks to the committee and to register the production volume of each yarn and cloth factory in order to carry out so-called \"unified purchase, unified spinning, unified weaving, and unified sales.\" At the same time, the committee is also sending an economic secret agent to each factory as a \"resident commissioner\" to monitor the allocation of raw cotton and the status of processing and weaving. The bureaucratic capitalist China Textile Corporation, disregarding the opposition of cotton merchants in Shanghai, forcibly purchased cotton stocks from merchants there on the 15th of last month. The management committee has also decided to set up \"Grade A offices\" in six locations including Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Wuxi, and Xi'an, \"Grade B offices\" in eight locations including Qingdao, Nanjing, Nantong, Hangzhou, Yin County, Wuhu, Shenyang, and Taipei, and \"Grade C offices\" in three locations including Wu County, Wujin, and Kunming, in preparation for implementing a full-scale monopoly. The Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense has ordered all sea, land, and air forces and all joint logistics headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to \"assist in the national cotton yarn and cloth management work at any time.\" Cotton yarn and cloth manufacturers in various Chiang-controlled areas will therefore face a dead end.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 17th: The Chiang Kai-shek authorities are forcibly \"acquiring\" items such as wool, galvanized iron, and iron wire among the so-called \"unlicensed, self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving in port\" previously detained in Shanghai. The Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan passed five \"handling principles\" regarding wool and other goods at its 11th meeting, stipulating that importers are forced to apply to the (Chiang Kai-shek) government for \"acquisition\" before the 19th of this month, otherwise \"the goods will be confiscated.\" At the same time, it also ordered that galvanized iron and iron wire be \"uniformly acquired by the China Trust Bureau within 30 days, and re-export is not allowed.\" The \"acquisition\" price offered by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities is merely a piece of paper, a so-called \"special foreign currency deposit certificate\" to be paid in six installments over three years, which is effectively equivalent to depriving importers of all their operating capital.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪全面垄断花纱布　私营厂商走头无路\n\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪全面垄断花纱布\n  　私营厂商走头无路\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】据各方消息：蒋匪当局对全蒋区花纱布的全面垄断，本月起已开始逐步付诸实施。蒋匪于上月成立的“全国花纱布管理委员会”已强令苏、浙、皖三省蒋占城市棉商将其全部存棉售予该会，并登记各纱布厂生产量，以便进行所谓“统购、统纺、统织、统销”。同时该会并在各厂派一经济特务为“驻厂专员”，以监视各厂原棉分配及代纺代织生产状况。蒋匪官僚资本中纺公司已于上月十五日不顾上海各棉商之反对，在该地强购棉商存棉。该管委会并已决定在汉、津、穗、渝、无锡、西安等六地，设置“甲等办事处”，在青岛、南京、南通、杭州、鄞县、芜湖、沈阳、台北等八地，设置“乙等办事处”，在吴县、武进、昆明等三地，设置“丙等办事处”，准备实行全面垄断。蒋匪国防部已下令蒋匪所有海、陆、空军及各联勤总部“随时协助进行全国花纱布管理工作”。蒋区各地花纱布厂商将因此面临绝境。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋匪当局强迫“收购”前被扣留在沪的所谓“无证自备外汇到埠货品”中之羊毛、镀锌、铅丝等项，蒋匪行政院十一日会议通过关于羊毛等项货品“处理原则”五项，规定强迫进口商于本月十九日以前向（蒋匪）政府申请“收购”，否则“货物予以没收”。同时，并复命令镀锌及铅丝两项货物于三十天以内“一律由中信局收购，不准重运出口”。蒋匪当局“收购”代价仅为一纸，以三年分六期付齐之所谓“特种外币存单”，实际等于剥夺进口商之全部营业资本。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 17th: Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Shanghai continue to cruelly persecute students in various schools. According to incomplete figures from Shanghai newspapers cited by foreign news agencies on the 13th, after the Tongji University bloodbath, Chiang Kai-shek bandits have already forced various universities to expel 217 students. Tongji University alone expelled 127 students, of whom more than 40 were then subjected to imprisonment and \"interrogation\" by Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Several arrested students, in the severe cold of winter, were stripped of their clothes by Chiang Kai-shek bandits and thrown into cement prisons, one of whom has now died. Among the arrested students from St. John's University, two were released but then re-arrested by Chiang Kai-shek bandits.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Comprehensive news: The situation of hunger and lack of education among students in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas is becoming increasingly serious. At Tianjin's Nankai University, before the Lunar New Year in December, the monthly food expenses for students were 550,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency for type A meals and 450,000 for type B. By January of this year, type A had increased to 1.2 million per month, and type B to 900,000. In just one month, the price doubled. During the winter vacation, more than 500 students remained at the school. The dining hall planned to start providing meals from January 15th, but by the 13th, the funds for meals were still not secured. Students universally felt the threat of hunger, and bulletin boards were filled with advertisements for selling clothes. At Tangshan Institute of Technology, food expenses in January had already risen to 1.2 million. Many students could not afford meals. In Taiyuan, where Yan Xishan bandits are entrenched, the price of millet reached over 4 million Chiang Kai-shek currency per stone in mid-January. Students could not maintain their livelihoods and began to withdraw from school and drop out from December of the previous year.\n\nWith soaring prices, private universities and middle and primary schools in various Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas have increased tuition fees for the next semester. In Guangzhou, tuition fees at private universities are as high as 5.12 million, and junior high schools also require 3.2 million. At Yenching University in Beiping, tuition and miscellaneous fees for the next semester are 4.5 million, and other private institutions will all start at at least one million. Many private middle schools in Tianjin are unable to maintain operations due to financial difficulties and plan to merge to form Xiehe Middle School, with fees between 1.05 million and 2 million. Private primary schools charge around one million. Chiang Kai-shek area newspapers report that ordinary middle-class families can no longer afford to send their children to school and predict that after the winter vacation, a large number of students in Chiang Kai-shek areas will drop out of school.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪继续迫害学生　开除、逮捕、坐牢、冻死\n\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪继续迫害学生\n  　开除、逮捕、坐牢、冻死\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】上海蒋匪继续残酷迫害各校学生。据外国通讯社十三日引沪报不完整数字，同济大学血案发生后，蒋匪已迫令各大学开除学生二百十七人，仅同济一校即开除一百二十七人，其中四十余人复横遭蒋匪监禁及“审讯”。若干被捕学生在冬天严寒中，被蒋匪剥去衣服，投入水门汀牢狱中，现已死去一人。圣约翰被捕学生中，两人被释放后复遭将匪再度逮捕。\n    【新华社陕北十六区日电】综合消息：蒋管区学生饥饿、失学情况日趋严重。天津南开大学年前十二月学生甲种膳食费每月蒋币五十五万元，乙种四十五万元，至今年一月甲种增至每月一百廿万元，乙种九十万元，仅隔一月即暴涨一倍。该校寒假中五百余学生留校，膳团拟于一月十五日起伙，但至十三日膳费仍无着落，学生普遍感受饥饿威胁，布告栏中贴满出卖衣服的广告。唐山工学院一月份膳食已涨至一百二十万元，许多学生开不起伙食。阎匪盘踞下的太原，一月中旬小米每石达四百余万元，学生无法维持生活，从年前十二月份起纷纷退学辍业。\n    在物价高涨下，蒋区各地私立大中小学下学期纷纷增加学费。广州各私立大学收费高达五百十二万元，初中亦需三百二十万元。北平燕京大学下学期学杂费四百五十万，其他各私立院校均将以百万起码。天津许多私立中学因经费困难无法维持，拟合并成立协合中学，收费在一百零五万至二百万之间；私立小学收费均在百万上下。蒋区报纸报导：一般中等家庭已无法负担其子弟就学，并预料寒假过后，蒋区各地学生将大量失学。"

    "content": "Chiang Area Faces Severe Grain Shortage\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th—A Shanghai magazine reveals that the Chiang-controlled areas are facing a severe grain shortage due to a sharp decline in grain production last year. The magazine states that last year's rice harvest in the Chiang-controlled areas was only 67% of the normal yield, estimated at 48.3 million metric tons (i.e., 96.6 million *shi dan*), a shortfall of 3 million metric tons compared to the required amount (i.e., 60 million *shi dan*, equivalent to approximately 37.8 million *shi dan* of white rice). The wheat harvest was even lower, accounting for 60% of the normal yield. The magazine says that if the insufficient grain were to be purchased from foreign countries, each million metric tons of white rice would require $200 million in foreign exchange, which is clearly impossible to raise. It also stated that the \"terrifying\" grain shortage before this year's autumn harvest \"is really unimaginable and unbearable to imagine.\" The magazine implies that this kind of disaster is caused by Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt and evil rule, saying: The import of white rice in the 10th year of the Republic of China was only 10 million *dan*, while after the 15th year of the Republic of China, the annual import of white rice was frequently over 20 million *dan*. It also said that the reasons for the sharp decline in grain production are that Chiang Kai-shek regularly maintains millions of regular troops, resulting in a shortage of rural labor; Chiang Kai-shek insists on the feudal system of tenancy exploitation and heavy taxes, which shackles productivity and forces farmers to leave the land. At the same time, it is also the inevitable product of (American) imperialist economic aggression and the destruction of the countryside.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区粮荒严重\n\n1948-02-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区粮荒严重\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】上海某杂志披露：由于去年粮产锐减，蒋区正面临严重粮荒。该杂志称：去年蒋区稻谷收成仅为常年产量的百分之六十七，估计为四千八百三十万公吨（即九万六千六百万市担），较需要量相差三百万公吨（即六千万市担，约合白米三千七百八十万市担）。小麦收成尤少，计为常年产量的百分之六十。该杂志说：此项不敷之粮食若向外国购买，则每百万公吨白米需外汇两亿美元，显然无法筹措。并称：今年秋收以前的“可怕”粮荒，“实在是不敢想象，不忍想象”。该杂志暗示：此类灾祸，系由蒋匪的腐恶统治所造成，它说：民国十年白米的输入仅一千万担，而民国十五年以后白米进口每年经常在两千万担以上。并说：粮产锐减的原因为蒋匪经常保持数百万常备军，造成农村劳力缺乏；蒋匪坚持封建的租佃剥削制度及重重捐税，束缚了生产力，迫使农民纷纷脱离土地。同时，也是（美）帝国主义经济侵略，摧毁农村的必然产物。"

    "content": "Border Region People Sincerely Support the Land Law\n　　Poor and Landless Peasants Actively Refute Others' Distortions of the Land Law, Leading Everyone to Follow the Bright Road Pointed Out by Chairman Mao.\n    [This Newspaper's Report] After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, it was warmly supported by the people of the entire region. Everyone said, \"The Communist Party and Chairman Mao's method is truly brilliant.\" They are willing to resolutely implement the equal distribution of land and conscientiously reorganize the ranks.\n\n    Poor and landless peasants from Wanggou and other mountain villages along Zuoquan Road traveled long distances to listen to lectures on the Land Law in the main village of Gaojiajing, and they also participated enthusiastically in discussions. Zhang Fulin, a poor peasant from Maquan Mountain Village, said: \"In the past, the local despots and landlords exploited us so much that we couldn't afford to eat or wear clothes. When we had something to do and came to Gaojiajing, did anyone look up to us, young or old? Now, when we come to Gaojiajing, people shout from afar: 'Old Zhang is here!' Today, listening to the Land Law, it says that we poor people will be in power. This is really the first time since I was born.\" Hu Sanrong and Liu Fuheng, poor peasants from Nanyucun Village in Xiyang, said: \"This is great, the land will be distributed fairly. There are few landlords in our village, and after struggling for some land, the cadres got all the good land and the land closest to the village. We didn't dare to voice our opinions, and they (other people) wouldn't give us anything good either. This time, we can also get a share of the land; this is how everyone can truly have food to eat and land to cultivate.\" An Qicheng from Sanpang Village in Linzhang said: \"The north and east of our village are all good land, while the south and west are all sandy land. I have seven or eight mu of southwest land, and after the distribution, I still have southwest land; the grain I harvest is not enough to eat. This new method has really saved my life.\"\n\n    Some poor and landless peasants in some places believe that \"the Land Law is good, but I'm afraid it can't be done.\" They mostly think from past experiences. For example, poor and landless peasants from Donghu Village in Shahe said, \"In the past, it was just talk that poor and landless peasants were the backbone, it was a false name. When it came to loans, the poor and landless didn't get a single cent.\" Poor peasants from Xihu Village also said: \"In the past movements, cadres only said that poor peasants should take the lead, but when it came to distributing the fruits, they wouldn't let the poor peasants manage it. When cadres distributed the fruits, they wanted the masses to support them, so they proposed: 'Don't forget the well-digger when drinking water.' As a result, they supported sixteen cypress trees. The masses were left with an empty name of liberation.\" After publicizing the Land Law, these people understood the great principle of the poor and landless being masters of their own affairs, and realized that they must truly rise up and work hard this time.\n\n    Some poor and landless peasants also had some doubts about giving landlords and family members of KMT officers living in the countryside a share of land, some because the landlords had not been thoroughly struggled against. For example, Li Guifu from Ziping Village in Xiyang said: \"Even if you give the landlord a share, it's okay, the landlord in our village hasn't been defeated, he eats better and dresses warmer than our liberated peasants, I don't agree that he should share the land with the peasants.\" Some people couldn't figure it out either. For example, Yan Shuangqing from Xiguxian Village in Changzhi said: \"I don't agree to giving the landlord land to cultivate, isn't that the same as giving back the fruits of our labor?\" Cao Quantai said: \"The Kuomintang officers are fighting with us, they are our enemies, I don't agree that we should give them land to cultivate.\" After publicizing the Land Law, everyone understood the reasoning. Yuan Songshan from Xiguxian Village said: \"I agree with the idea of distributing land to the families of Kuomintang officers. If we give them land to cultivate, and they know about it, they might lay down their weapons and come back, and our victory can come sooner.\" Li Sanwang said: \"The landlord must also get a share; as it stands now, the landlord has nothing, and we have to provide him with food and clothing. If we don't give him land to cultivate and we don't let him work anymore, he will starve to death, which will ruin our liberated area's policy, and it won't be beneficial to our peasants.\" They unanimously agreed that as long as the landlord's land and property are completely confiscated, and he bows his head politically, he should be given a share.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边区人民真心拥护土地法  贫雇农积极打破别人对土地法的曲解，领上大家走毛主席指给的光明大道。\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边区人民真心拥护土地法\n　　贫雇农积极打破别人对土地法的曲解，领上大家走毛主席指给的光明大道。\n    【本报消息】土地法大纲公布后，获得全区人民热烈拥护。大家都说：\"共产党毛主席的办法真是英明。\"愿意坚决把平分土地整编队伍认真做好。\n    左权路王沟等山庄的贫雇农，跑很远路到主村高家井听讲土地法，讨论时也很热心。马圈山庄贫农张福林说：\"过去恶霸地主剥削的俺吃不上穿不上，有事来高家井，大小孩谁看起咱？这时候来高家井，远远地就有人喊：'老张来啦！'今天听土地法叫咱穷人掌权，这真是娘生以来头一次。\"昔阳南榆村贫雇胡三荣、刘富恒说：\"这可好，土地要分得公平了。咱村地主少，斗争些地，把好地近地都叫干部分啦。咱不敢提意见，伢（人家）也不给咱分好东西。这次咱也能分到一份地；这才真能人人有饭吃，人人有地种。\"临漳三庞村安其成说：\"俺村村北村东都是好地，村南村西都是沙地。我有七、八亩西南地，分了二十亩还是西南地；打的粮食不够吃，这个新办法真救了我的命啦。\"\n    还有些地方贫雇认为：\"土地法好是好，就是怕办不到。\"他们多是从过去的经验想的。如沙河东户村贫雇农说\"过去光说贫雇当骨干，那是个假名，贷款时贫雇一个钱也没使上。\"西户村贫雇也说：\"过去运动中干部光说贫雇带头，可是分果实就不让贫雇管了。干部分果实时想叫群众拥护，就提出：吃水不忘掏井人。结果拥护了十六棵柏树。群众落了个翻身空名。\"这些人经过宣传土地法，懂得了贫雇当家的大道理，认识到他们这次要真正起来好好干。\n    还有些贫雇农对于给地主和住在乡村的蒋军官兵家属分一份有些怀疑，有的是因为地主没斗透。如昔阳紫坪村李贵福说：\"就是分给地主一份也可以，咱村地主没斗垮，比咱翻身农民还吃得好穿得暖，我不同意农民分地他也分。\"也有些人想不通。如长治西故县村阎双庆说：\"给地主分地种，我不同意，这不等于倒果实吗？\"曹全太说：\"国民党军官和咱打，是咱仇人，咱再给他地种，我不同意。\"经过宣传土地法，大家想清楚了道理。西故县村原松山说：\"分给国民党官兵家庭地种，我同意这一意见。咱把地给他种，他知道了，可以放下武器回来，咱们的胜利可以早点。\"李三旺说：\"地主也要分一份才行；以现在说，地主啥也没有，吃穿都得咱给他。要是不分给他地种，咱再不叫他做活，就要饿死，坏了咱解放区的政策，对咱农民也没利。\"他们一致认为只要地主土地财产全部没收了，政治上低头了应该分他一份。"

    "content": "According to reports from Zanhuang, Huguan, Zuoquan, Neiqiu, Licheng, and Wu'an counties in Taihang: The \"Outline Land Law of China,\" the \"Provisional Regulations on Punishing Those Who Sabotage Land Reform,\" the \"Letter to All Party Members,\" and the \"Letter to All Peasants\" have not been adequately used as weapons in some areas to educate the masses and cadres in order to stop acts of sabotage. In some individual places, simple administrative orders and detention and punishment measures have been adopted. For example, Zhang Baozi from Huayuan Village in Zanhuang secretly sold more than one mu of paddy land after hearing the news of land distribution, taking advantage of the fact that the masses were not yet aware of it. The public security director and the militia committee director of Ziliang Village in the Sixth District of Huguan registered the property of all the masses in the village, and the village finance and grain director, who mobilized the masses to cut down trees, were also detained in the district. Although these cadres felt some pressure from the district from above, they did not admit their mistakes to the masses and bow their heads, nor did they receive education and transformation from the masses. In Zuoquan and Neiqiu, on the surface, it seems that the masses have risen to stop the village's acts of sabotage against the Land Law, but in reality, it is still the cadres' administrative orders. For example, Bai Changxing, the village chief of Xijie Village in the First District of Neiqiu, sold trees and two dou of grain. It is said that the poor and hired peasants also removed him from his position and sent him to the county government detention center. Whether the poor and hired peasants were mobilized is still under investigation. Some places think that using the poor and hired peasants to detain people is the mass line, but in fact, it is still their own administrative orders and bureaucratic style at work. This approach cannot enable cadres to be supervised and transformed by the masses of the whole village, nor can it mobilize all the peasants to consciously oppose the sabotage of the Land Law. Some places have some good practices in preventing the sabotage of the Land Law: For example, Yang Changquan, the village chief of Tian'erzhuang Village in the Ninth District of Wu'an, privately sold seventy-six sheep after the Land Law was announced and suppressed the masses very severely. The district did not adopt detention measures. Before the poor and hired peasants were mobilized, he was first transferred to the district to reflect for a few days, and in order to educate the cadres of the entire district, he was removed from his post. Then he was allowed to return to the village to reflect on his mistakes among the masses. The whole village not only deeply publicized the Land Law, but also sent representatives to the village cadres' meeting to give him many opinions. This educated the cadres and also educated the masses to support the Land Law. The masses of Sanbaishu Village in the Eighth District of Wu'an have very bright eyes after publicizing the Land Law. Therefore, when they discovered that the political director Zhang Shulin was helping a few people in the village to sell trees and sabotage the Land Law, they immediately connected everyone to stop it, stopped the tree felling, and reported it to the district. The government has removed Zhang from his post and let him reflect among the masses. The same is true for the masses of Lijia Kiln in Licheng. They have the Land Law as their foundation, and they are bolder. When someone in the village sabotaged the Land Law for the first time, they were stopped by the masses of the whole village. Later, Li Yun, a conscription committee member, sold things for the landlord and was immediately stopped by the masses, and the bad cadre was reported and prepared to be dealt with together during the distribution. Under this kind of mass, anytime, anywhere supervision, no one in the village dared to sabotage it anymore.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黎城武安运用群众监督　教育破坏土地法的人\n\n1948-02-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黎城武安运用群众监督\n　　教育破坏土地法的人\n    【本报消息】据太行赞皇、壶关、左权、内邱、黎城、武安等县的报导：对中国土地法大纲、破坏土地改革治罪暂行条例、告党员书以及告农民书等文件，一部分地区还没很好的当作武器来运用，教育群众，教育干部，以制止破坏行为。个别地方，只是简单的采取了一种行政命令和扣押惩办的办法。如赞皇花园村张包子听到平分土地的消息后，乘群众还不知道，就偷偷的把一亩多水地卖掉了。壶关六区子良庄公安主任、武委会主任带民兵登记了全村群众的财产，村财粮主任，发动群众砍树，也一同被扣押到区上。这些干部，虽感受到区上自上而下的一点压力，但并没有在群众中认错低头，得到群众的教育和改造。在左权、内邱从表面上看，好象群众已经起来阻止村里破坏土地法的行为了，实际上仍是干部的行政命令。如内邱一区西街村长白长兴，卖了树又卖了二斗粮食，据说贫雇也撤了他的职，把他送到县府看守所里。是不是贫雇发动起来了，还可以调查，有些地方以为通过贫雇去扣人押人便算是群众路线，其实还是自己的行政命令、官僚主义作风在作怪。这种作法并不能使干部得到全村群众的监督和改造，也不能发动全体农民自觉的反对破坏土地法。有些地方阻止破坏土地法，也有一些好的作法：如武安九区田二庄村长杨常全在土地法公布后，私卖了七十六只羊，压制群众也很厉害，区上没有采用扣押的办法，在贫雇没有发动以前，先调他到区上反省了几天，并为了教育全区干部撤了他的职，然后让他回村在群众中反省认错，全村一面深入宣传土地法，一面又派代表在村干部会上向他提了许多意见。这样教育了干部，也教育了群众拥护土地法。武安八区三柏树群众，经过宣传土地法，他们的眼睛是很亮的。因此当他们发现政治主任张树林，帮助村里少数几个人卖树破坏土地法时，他们即串连大家去制止，停止了砍树，并报告区上，政府已将张撤了职，并让他在群众中反省。黎城栗家窑群众也是一样，他们有土地法作底子，胆子就大了。当村里第一次有人破坏土地法时，就被全村群众制止了。以后抗勤委员栗云替地主卖东西，也立即被群众卡住，并将这个坏干部检举出来，准备在平分时一同处理。在这种群众性的随时随地监督下，村里再也没有人敢破坏了。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-22",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th. Political Commissar Wu of a certain division of the Northeast People's Liberation Army responded to the call from superiors to \"military and political leaders and cadres to go deep into the grassroots and implement specific leadership.\" He went to a certain battalion to personally help with the work and gained the following preliminary experiences in eight days: First, he helped a certain battalion correct the work style of its leaders which was focused on being overly preoccupied with routine matters. In the past, when arranging military studies or other work, the battalion planned today for tomorrow, and notices were issued only in the evening, which put the cadres below in a passive position. They could not prepare and had to cope hastily, failing to achieve the expected results. For example, the Sixth Company's branch committee held as many as 32 meetings in two months, which brought normal work to a standstill. Second, ideological education was strengthened to avoid simple \"struggle.\" When the Fifth Company's First Platoon held a platoon meeting and criticized the old soldier Lü Shuhai for falling behind, the squad leader went to pull him back, which led to a quarrel. At that time, neither the squad leader nor Lü humbly reflected on their actions, which caused the criticism meeting to become deadlocked. The instructor advocated immediately convening a branch general meeting to carry out ideological struggle against Lü. Political Commissar Wu suggested to them: first, conduct individual talks to allow both sides to reflect, and then hold a criticism meeting. As a result, simple \"struggle\" was avoided, and unity was achieved. In addition, he also convened a squad leader symposium to discuss squad leadership and consolidation work. He personally summarized the squad leadership methods and improved the squad leaders' abilities. When convening a branch committee group leader symposium, he also summarized how the branch committee developed party members, carried out party education, and how to assist in administrative work, which improved the work of the branch. Political Commissar Wu also explained how to take the mass line in leadership work, and how to implement ideological education of loving soldiers, correcting the notion of some company cadres who measured the soldiers' consciousness by whether they supported the cadres. He proposed that cadres should take the initiative to love soldiers to gain the soldiers' support. The main reason for Political Commissar Wu's achievements in going deep into the grassroots is that he had no airs and was very enthusiastic and sincere to both cadres and soldiers. He ate sorghum rice with the soldiers, personally poured tea when soldiers came, and deeply understood the new leadership methods instructions of Commander Lin and Director Tan.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China Front, 19th. A certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army has transformed the work style of its headquarters. Under the slogans of \"put down airs, become one with the soldiers, help the companies solve specific problems\" and \"move the office into the company,\" the direct subordinate departments of the regiment, namely the staff, political, supply, and health departments, have transferred most of their cadres to the companies to work alongside the soldiers and help the companies improve various tasks. It has now been proven that this is a good way to strengthen the work of the military organs. During the recent training campaign, the regiment's staff department left only one staff officer to persist in the work. The three comrades who went down to the company discovered many problems in military education, assault exercises, the removal of ideological concerns of demolition personnel, and the improvement of demolition technology. This greatly strengthened the staff organ's guidance on the military work of the companies. The political department left one cadre in the headquarters to replace the work of several people, which strengthened the efficiency of the headquarters work. The three groups that went down to the company greatly promoted the work of the company. For example, the organization section summarized the shortcomings of a branch's work and two good typical group materials. The propaganda section summarized the problem of unity and mutual assistance in a squad. The liaison section summarized the materials for reviewing and educating liberated soldiers. Comrades from the supply department personally participated in buying vegetables and grinding flour, helped the company improve its food, and cleared up long-standing accounts of several units. The cadres who stayed behind to persist in the work also successfully completed the supply work for the entire regiment. Most of the cadres of the health team went down to the company, and gave great help and promotion to the company's sick bay and environmental hygiene. At the same time, the comrades who stayed behind also completed the medical treatment of convalescing members and the education of nursing staff. In the work, close organic cooperation has truly been achieved between various large and small departments, solving the past phenomenon of formal cooperation but actual separation of each. For example, when the staff officer helped the demolition squad learn military technology in the company, and the demolition personnel had ideological concerns about demolition, the staff officer first came to help the demolition personnel clear their minds and remove their concerns, and did political work. Comrades from the political department also did military work when participating in company military exercises and evaluations. Because there were liberated soldiers and party member soldiers in the squad, military and political studies included the work of the organization, propaganda, and security departments. In addition, they initially found a way for the military organs to closely cooperate with the company, and greatly improved the morale and prestige of the military organs' cadres.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北我军某师吴政委  深入下层具体领导　加强思想教育避免单纯“斗争”\n\n1948-02-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北我军某师吴政委\n    深入下层具体领导\n  　加强思想教育避免单纯“斗争”\n    【新华社东北十五日电】东北解放军某师吴政委响应上级提出：“军政首长干部深入下层，实行具体领导”的号召。他到某营亲自帮助工作，在八天中获得初步经验如下：首先是帮助某营改正了营领导上事务主义的作风。该营从前在布置军事学习或其他工作时，是今天计划明天，今晚才下通知，使下面干部的工作处于被动，无法准备，仓促应付，达不到预期效果。又如该营六连支委会在两月内开会三十二次之多，使正常工作陷入停滞状态。其次，是加强思想教育，避免单纯“斗争”。五连一排开排务会，当检讨到老战士吕树海掉队，班长去拉，即引起了口角，当时班长与吕都不虚心反省，使检讨会成为僵局，指导员主张立即召开支部大会，对吕进行思想斗争，吴政委向他们提出：首先进行个别谈话，让双方反省，然后再开检讨会，结果免避了单纯“斗争”，达到了团结。此外，他还召集了班长座谈会，讨论班的领导与巩固工作，他亲自总结了班的领导方法，提高了班长能力。在召开支委小组长座谈时，又总结了支委发展党员进行党的教育，及如何帮助行政工作等，改进了支部工作。吴政委还讲解领导工作如何走群众路线，及贯彻爱兵的思想教育，纠正了某些连队干部以战士是否拥护干部作为测量战士觉悟的尺度，提出要以干部主动爱兵来取得战士拥护。吴政委深入下层获得这些成绩的主要原因，是自己没有架子，无论对干部战士都很热情诚恳，与战士同吃高粱饭，战士来时，亲自倒茶，深入营连体会了林司令员谭主任新的领导方法指示的结果。\n    【新华社华东前线十九日电】解放军某团转变机关作风，在“放下架子，与战士打成一片，帮助连队解决具体问题”，“把办公室搬进连队里去”的口号下，团直司、政、供、卫各部门抽调大部干部下连，与战士们一道，帮助连队改进各种工作。现已证明这是加强部队机关工作的好办法。在近月练兵运动中，该团参谋处只留下一个参谋坚持工作，下连的三位同志，在军事教育、攻坚演习、对爆破员思想顾虑的解除、爆破技术的提高各方面发现了许多问题，大大加强了参谋机关对连队军事工作的指导。政治处留在机关的干部一人顶替数人的工作，加强了机关工作效率，而下连队的三个小组更大大推动了连队工作。如组织股总结了一个支部工作存在的缺点和两个好的典型小组材料。宣教股总结了一个班的团结互助问题。联络股总结了审查教育解放战士的材料。供给处同志亲自参加买菜、磨面，帮助连队改善了伙食，清算了几个单位久悬未清的帐目。留下坚持工作的干部同样顺利完成供应全团的供给工作。卫生队大部干部下连，对连队的病号突击治疗和环境卫生都给了很大的帮助和推动，同时留队同志也完成了休养员的医疗任务与护理员的教育工作。在工作中，各个大小部门间真正做到了密切的有机配合，解决了过去形式上配合而实际上各搞各的分家现象。例如参谋在连队帮助爆破班学习军事技术而爆破员在思想上对爆破有顾虑，参谋就先来帮助爆破员打通思想，解除顾虑，做了政治工作。政治处同志在参加连队军事演习和评判时，也同样做了军事工作。因为班里有解放战士、有党员战士，因此军事学习与政治学习更是包括了组织、宣传、保卫等各部门的工作。此外初步摸到了部队机关工作如何和连队密切配合的门径，也大大提高了机关干部的情绪和威信。"

In Poland, the Central Joint Committee of Democratic Parties approved the Polish Peasant Party's request to join the committee on the 8th, thereby strengthening the \"struggle against reactionaries\" (TASS). At the same time, the Polish government decided to allocate 39.3 billion rubles this year for construction work, a sharp increase of 17 billion rubles compared to last year. In Romania, according to a report in the Romanian Communist Party's newspaper: Romanian political parties will organize a strong People's Democratic Front to consolidate and develop the young republic. The conditions for establishing this front are now ripe, and the merger congress of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party was held on the 17th. The Peasants' Front has expelled wealthy peasant elements from its leadership and has joined with the Peasants' Party to form a united front of working peasants. In addition, unified organizations of democratic women and youth in Romania have also been established. On the other hand, as a result of vigorous construction, people's living standards are improving day by day. Grain prices have fallen by 30 to 50 percent in the past two months, doubling people's purchasing power and filling the market with prosperity. Bucharest has recently established 124 new state-owned stores. Albania recently presented a draft plan for the development of the national economy in 1948 in order to further improve people's living standards and consolidate national defense.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th—The spokesman for the People's Liberation Army Headquarters today announced the truth about the killing of three foreign missionaries in Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province on January 7th, stating: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from the Chiang Kai-shek propaganda organ on January 13th, \"The US Embassy spokesman announced on the 13th: On January 7th, American female missionaries Nordin's group, Anderson's group, and a Finnish doctor named Brook were murdered by bandits between Xiangyang and Jingmen in Hubei Province.\" After investigation by our Headquarters, it has been verified that this was done by Ma Xinqi, the director of the Five-Township Joint Defense Office of Zhongxiang, Hubei, a Chiang Kai-shek bandit. The bandit Ma Xinqi dispatched troops at noon on January 7th to rob a vehicle in Kujiawan, Lishan Township, Zhongxiang, killing three foreign missionaries, two women and one man, and looting a great deal of property. This matter is well known to the local people. The People's Liberation Army eliminated this scourge for the people and encircled and annihilated the bandit Ma Xinqi on January 30th. The spokesman pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, on the one hand, instructed its bandits to rob and kill foreign missionaries, impersonating our People's Liberation Army, attempting to slander the reputation of our great People's Liberation Army; on the other hand, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits instigated their propaganda organ, the Central News Agency, to spread rumors that the despicable act of robbing and killing innocent foreign missionaries was committed by the People's Liberation Army, which is extremely shameless. The spokesman pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek has now appointed Kang Ze as the director of the so-called Fourteenth Pacification Zone, responsible for the defense of the northern Hubei area. Kang Ze is one of the well-known heads of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent bandits, the former head of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, and has served as the leader of a special anti-communist task force. Ma Xinqi is under the command of Kang Ze. This incident makes the background of the killing of three innocent foreign missionaries in Zhongxiang even more obvious. The spokesman also pointed out that reactionaries among the American Catholic Church, such as Father An Leishan, are echoing the Chiang Kai-shek special agent bandits, spreading rumors that the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army plan to eliminate the Catholic faith in North China in 1948. It is evident that using religious issues as a topic to spread rumors and slander the great cause of national independence and democratic liberation of the Chinese people is a part of the common conspiracy of American imperialist elements and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The policy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army towards foreigners in China is to require them to obey the laws of the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army and not to engage in illegal activities. As long as they can do so, the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army will protect them. Freedom of religious belief is one of the established policies of the democratic government and the People's Liberation Army, and there is absolutely no reason to kill peaceful foreign missionaries. If foreigners in China commit illegal acts, such as helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and foreign imperialists against the Chinese people, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the People's Liberation Army, after verification, except for those who are armed and participate in the anti-people civil war, who should be treated as war objects by the People's Liberation Army, other criminals should be tried by the democratic government, given appropriate treatment according to the severity of their circumstances, and the reasons for the judgment and treatment should be publicly announced. It is absolutely not a matter of randomly killing them. The act of killing innocent foreign missionaries in Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province, can only be done by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Indeed, they have done so. The Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are opposed to such despicable acts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 人民解放军总部发言人揭露　蒋匪杀害外籍教士真相\n\n1948-02-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　人民解放军总部发言人揭露\n  　蒋匪杀害外籍教士真相\n    【新华社陕北二十日电】人民解放军总部发言人，今日宣布一月七日湖北钟祥县境内三个外籍传教士被杀之真相称：据蒋匪宣传机关中央社一月十三日电称：“美大使馆发言人十三日宣称：一月七日美国女传教士诺德兰小组、安德逊小组及另一芬兰籍医生布格于湖北襄阳及荆门间为匪徒杀害等语”。兹经本军总部查明，此系蒋匪湖北钟祥五乡联防办事处主任马馨起所为，该匪马馨起曾派出部队于一月七日中午，在钟祥丽山乡苦家湾劫车一辆，打死外籍教士三人，二女一男，并劫去财物甚多，此事为该地人民所周知。人民解放军为民除害，已于一月三十日将该匪马馨起包围歼灭。发言人指出蒋介石匪帮一方面指使其匪徒劫杀外国传教士，曾冒充我人民解放军，企图诬蔑我伟大的人民解放军的名誉；另一方面蒋匪又嗾使其宣传机关中央社大肆造谣，谓该项劫杀外国无辜传教士的卑鄙行为，系人民解放军所为，显系无耻已极。发言人指出：蒋介石现派康泽为所谓第十四绥靖区主任，负责鄂北地区之防务。康泽是著明的蒋介石特务匪徒的头子之一，过去三民主义青年团的负责人，当过专门反共的别动队的领导人，马馨起则在康泽指挥之下。此事使外籍无辜传教士三人在钟祥被杀的背景更为明显。发言人又指出美国天主教中之反动派如安乐山神父等，正与蒋介石特务匪徒互相唱和，放出谣言，谓中国共产党、中国民主政府与中国人民解放军，拟于一九四八年内绝灭华北之天主教信仰。足见以宗教问题为题目，造谣污蔑中国人民伟大的民族独立与民主解放的事业，乃是美国帝国主义分子与蒋介石匪帮的共同阴谋的一部分。中国共产党、中国民主政府与中国人民解放军，对于在华外国人的政策，是要求他们服从民主政府与人民解放军的法令，勿作犯法事务，只要他们能够如此，民主政府与人民解放军即予保护。信教自由是民主政府与人民解放军的既定政策之一，决无杀害和平的外国传教士之理。在华外国人中如有犯法行为，例如帮助蒋介石匪帮及外国帝国主义者，反对中国人民、中国民主政府及人民解放军查明属实者，除手执武器，参加反人民内战的人们，应由人民解放军当作战争对象处理者外，其他犯罪分子，应由民主政府审判，依其情节轻重，予以恰如其分的处理，并公开宣布判处理由，决不是随便予以杀害，象湖北钟祥县杀害外国无辜传教士的行为，只有国民党反动派方才做得出，果然他们就这样做了，中国共产党、中国民主政府与中国人民解放军是反对这类卑鄙行为的。"

    "date": "1948-02-22",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Jinnan News] At the Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee Land Conference, Guangping cadres underwent five or six days of self-reflection. Some comrades, due to insufficient understanding and a lack of humility, took detours. Later, four comrades with better understanding were found to give typical reports at the conference, and some poor and hired peasants were invited to offer their opinions at the conference. Zhang Xueyi, a comrade from a poor peasant background, reported first. He was a monk for six years as a child and had some rogue tendencies. After joining the army, he found a wife and didn't care about his Party relationship. He joined the revolution a second time, but was still hedonistic and corrupt, dissatisfied with his superiors, and felt he deserved credit. Unable to leave his wife, he forgot his roots, acting like a monk ringing the bell each day without sincerity, outwardly compliant but inwardly disobedient, and detached from his poor brothers. In his self-reflection, he recognized his mistakes. At the end of his report, he couldn't recall a single instance where he consciously did something for the poor peasants and began to cry, feeling very heartbroken. Other comrades from poor backgrounds were also moved to tears. Then, Wang Fengchun reported. His older sisters were sold far away, and he had to beg for food from the age of eight. Today, he had land, cattle, and a wife, and became a district chief, so he wanted to go home and enjoy himself. He said that for the sake of his wife, he protected his father-in-law, ignoring the life and death of the poor peasants. He hadn't spoken to poor peasants at his father-in-law's door, but when he gave one a brief word, that person was tied up by village cadres, and he was indifferent. At this point, he cried and couldn't speak. Half of the comrades in the audience shed tears. Li Mingyin, a middle peasant, reflected on how he suppressed activists, protected landlords, and helped landlords distribute their belongings when he was a village cadre. He realized that he was not worthy of being a Communist Party member and requested punishment. Poor peasant representative Bo Xiuzhu listened from the side and cried loudly, saying while crying, \"You cadre comrades protect landlords and rich peasants, protect village cadres, without thinking that poor fathers and mothers are still hungry and cold...!\" Another representative, Zhao Xichang, cried and said, \"Everyone says they are working for us poor people, but some things haven't been done well. I have nothing to burn, and I have to gather firewood to boil water. When I didn't attend the meeting, the village cadres said I was backward and stubborn, and gave me fewer fruits.\" The speeches of the poor and hired peasants touched the hearts of the cadres from poor and hired peasant backgrounds, and many people in the audience cried for ten minutes. Tenant representative Zheng Wenhua said, \"Only those close to the poor peasants can work for the poor peasants. In the past, when cadres entered the village, they only wanted to eat at the homes of the rich,嫌dirtying the homes of the poor. How could they know the suffering of the poor! What the cadres eat, drink, and wear, isn't it all from the people? Some people have forgotten that many poor peasants have nothing to eat now and are still hungry and cold. It's been several years since the liberation, and I am still being suppressed by some bad cadres and still dare not speak in the village. The labels of 'backward,' 'spy,' and 'bad egg' are still weighing on my head.\" Finally, the leaders spoke, asking comrades from poor peasants, middle peasants, and landlords and rich peasants to reflect carefully. Many comrades received a great education at this meeting. One cadre recalled that in the past he looked down on those carrying dung baskets and scolded poor peasants as \"backward,\" but today he realized that he eats and wears the people's things but hasn't done much for the people, which is very painful. Zhou Fengting said, \"When there are some difficulties in my family, I always worry about them when coming to meetings. Now I realize that there are many people who are even more difficult than myself!\" Most cadres said, \"I used to think I deserved credit, but now I think I haven't done anything for the poor peasants, and I am guilty!\" Many comrades received unprecedented enlightenment and education at this meeting, and their self-examination and reflection took a big step forward.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南三地委土地会议上  邀请贫雇帮助整党  启发干部深入反省\n\n1948-02-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南三地委土地会议上\n    邀请贫雇帮助整党  启发干部深入反省\n    【冀南消息】在冀南三地委土地会议上，广平干部经过五、六天反省，有些同志因为觉悟不够，又不虚心，走了弯路。后来找了四个认识较好的同志在大会上作典型报告，还请了一些贫雇在大会上提意见。贫农出身的张学义同志首先报告。他小时候当了六年和尚，有些流氓意识，参加到部队上工作，找了一个老婆，就不要党的关系了。二回参加革命，还是享乐腐化，对上级不满，认为自己有功。又离不开老婆，就忘本了，当一天和尚撞一天钟，阳奉阴违，脱离了穷兄弟。他在反省中认识了自己的错误，报告到最后，想不起哪一点是自觉的为贫农办了事，痛哭起来，非常痛心。别的贫苦出身的同志也感动的哭起来。接着由王凤春报告。他姐姐妹妹卖到远处，自己打八岁就要饭，今天有了地，有了牛，又有了老婆，当了区长，就想回家享受了。他说到为了老婆，包庇丈人，不管贫农死活；在丈人门上没有和贫农谈过话，就给一个谈了一下，那个人被村干捆了一绳，自己漠不关心。说到这里就哭的说不出话来。全场一半同志都掉下眼泪。李明银是中农，反省了自己当了村干，怎样打击积极分子，包庇地主，帮着地主分散东西。认识到自己不够一个共产党员，要求处分。贫农代表薄修竹在一边听了，放声大哭，一边哭一边说：“您干部同志们包庇地主富农，包庇村干部，没有想穷爹穷娘还饿着冻着咧…………！”又一个代表赵希长哭着说：“大家说为俺穷人办事，有些事可没办好。我没烧的，拾把柴火才能烧开锅。没去开会，村干部就说俺落后、顽固，少分给俺果实”。贫雇的发言打动了贫雇出身干部的心，会场上好多人一直哭了十来分钟。雇佃代表郑文华说：“接近贫农的才能为贫农办事，从前干部一进村，光想往有钱家吃饭，贫农家还嫌脏呢，哪能知道贫农的苦处！干部们吃的喝的穿的，哪一样不是老百姓的？有些人忘了现在好多贫农没啥吃，还挨饿挨冻。翻身翻了好几年，俺还被一些坏干部压着，还是不敢在村里说话。‘落后’、‘特务’、‘坏蛋’的帽子，还老是在头上压着”。最后领导上发言，要求贫农、中农和地主富农出身的同志们好好反省。许多同志在这一个会上得到很大教育，一个干部回想过去看不起背粪箩头的，骂贫农“落后”，今天才认识到吃穿老百姓的，可是没给老百姓办多少事，非常痛心。周凤亭说：“自己家里有点难处，来开会老是挂念。现在才知道比自己难的还多呀！”一般干部都说：“从先认为自己有功，现在想想没给贫农办了事，是有了罪呀！”许多同志在这个会上得到空前的启示与教育，对自己的检讨反省推进了一大步。"

    "content": "Landlord elements in Shi'er Village seized the opportunity to infiltrate the Party\n  　Controlling the branch and oppressing the peasants\n    [This newspaper dispatch] The Shi'er Village branch in the ninth district of Wu'an has been around for nearly ten years. When the branch was first established, it led the masses to fight against the Japanese invaders and landlords, but its work style was very undemocratic. Later, bankrupt landlords and ruffians infiltrated the branch, causing serious impurity within the Party. They provoked the branch to suppress the peasants, and some party members who were essentially good were also negatively influenced by them. The general situation of Shi'er Village and the situation of the branch are reported as follows:\n    Shi'er Village is a relatively poor village. To this day, the masses still circulate the saying: \"If you want to eat noodles, go to Boyan; if you want to eat bran, go to Shi'er Village.\" The whole village has 296 households, 1,007 people, and 35.24 hectares of land, averaging 0.23 hectares per person, with an average yield of 510 kg. Compared with nearby villages, the quantity and yield are both lower. The soil is rocky and thin, surrounded by sandy and rocky mountains. There is a lot of hillside land. When it rains, the land is covered with a layer of sand. The masses say: \"The land of Shi'er Village is hanging on the walls.\" This kind of land produces less grain and requires a lot of wasted work. Every winter, in order to accumulate fertilizer, the white grass roots in the mountain gullies have to be scraped clean.\n    Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the village sent 180 long-term laborers to the bottom of the slope (east of Tanling), mostly to Zhouzhuang, which was once known as Little Shi'er Village. Even now, there are still 68 shop assistants and coolies isolated in Guandong (Manchuria), Tianjin and other areas, and there are still 137 old and young bachelors in the village.\n    Before and after the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were no landlords in the whole village who owned more than one hectare of land. The total number of hectares owned by the 29 landlord and rich peasant families did not exceed 6.6 hectares. However, the political and economic power was completely in their hands. Liu Zhengren and Wang Guoqing were their ringleaders. The masses said: \"The two of them hold up half the sky of Shi'er Village.\"\n    In the winter of 1938, the village had a secret Party group of four members. When preparing to establish a peasant association, the landlords established a fake peasant association first. In other villages, taxes were levied according to five grades, but this village still apportioned them as before, mostly on the poor. The landlords spread rumors that several poor peasant activists were lazy people, and turned their names into songs to sing in the streets: \"Zhang Wansheng, Guo Peiyuan, worms in the nose (poor peasant Ren Xingliang had a nose problem) Lao Danian, Jin Wang, Humen doesn't touch the strings.\" One night, when the peasant association was established, Liu Zhengren and Wang Guoqing led a group of landlords into the venue and blocked the registration of names on the road. The first peasant association was thus dispersed by them.\n    In the spring of 1939, the number of Party members increased to eleven, and the peasant association was re-established, followed by a struggle against Liu Zhengren because he colluded with the big traitor Li Pinshan to establish the \"Autonomous Army\" in Niuwangwa. All his family's movable property was confiscated. After this big boss was overthrown, the landlords' open political power was basically destroyed. Economically, through the investigation of black land in 1941, the liquidation of the agency heads' accounts (agency heads were all landlords taking turns), and the rent and interest reduction movement in 1942, a part of them was greatly weakened, and seven families completely collapsed. Some poor and hired peasants received a portion of grain and land, and some bought a portion of the landlords' land at low prices or pawned a portion of land.\n    Although the new regime in the village was established relatively early, and the struggle against the enemy and the landlords was very resolute, its work style was extremely undemocratic, forming one-man rule. The power of the Party, government, and armed forces was completely in the hands of Guo Peiyuan, who came from a ruffian background. The masses said of him: \"He looks down on both ends, looks down on the landlords and also looks down on the poor.\" Not only were the masses afraid of him, but even the cadres and Party members had to completely listen to his instructions. Whoever disagreed with him was kicked out. Honest peasant Party members were expelled from the Party, and bankrupt landlords, ruffians, and middle peasants were absorbed in large numbers, causing impurity within the Party and planting bad roots. At this time, the number of Party members had increased to 21, including two poor peasants, 17 middle peasants, and two bankrupt landlords.\n    In famine years, the relief grain and regulating grain issued by the government, as well as the grain obtained from investigating black land and liquidating the agency heads' accounts, were given to whoever he wanted to give it to. The accounts for these grains were never made public. The poor and middle peasants couldn't even eat bran, and people died (more than 70 people died in 1942 and 1943) or fled, while his family (six people) never stopped eating noodles and meat, and also supported a prostitute. The masses said: \"If Old Guo doesn't die, the opinions about him couldn't be carried by livestock. Calculating the accounts of the cooperative is better than calculating the accounts of the famine years.\"\n    After the \"May 4th\" Directive, Guo Peiyuan had died, but the newly risen cadres still inherited his mantle in their work style, monopolizing power, oppressing the masses, and fighting on behalf of the masses. Four struggles were carried out successively in the anti-traitor liquidation and filling-in-the-gaps movements, killing five special agent landlords and struggling against 25 landlord and rich peasant families. Ten middle peasant families were struggled against in the name of politics, and poor peasant Niu Qiushan was struggled against in the name of bandits and beaten to death. This case has not yet been resolved. A total of 18.9 hectares of land and 309 rooms were seized. In addition, 19 middle peasant families, fearing trouble, contributed 87 rooms.\n    The distribution of these fruits was as follows: the land was roughly average in quantity and yield. The cadres were mostly middle peasants, and they received a total of less than 0.67 hectares. However, a few cadres exchanged bad land for good land, and some military dependents and aggressive rogue activists received good land. There was originally little good land, so most of the land distributed to the poor and hired peasants was bad land. The distribution of houses was even more unfair. After several large cadres had selected the good houses, the remainder was distributed to military dependents. The houses distributed to the poor and hired peasants were not only bad but also few. Movable property was only distributed once at the end. In the past, it was all sold for money: 1. Low-price grading and sale. The poor and hired peasants were nominally first-class, with the priority to buy, but they had no money, and the good things were still bought by second and third class (cadres were mostly in the second class). 2. Price raising and sale: whoever paid the most money, it was sold to them. The masses had to pay in cash, but the cadres could owe money. 3. Not directly moving the landlord's movable property, but letting him sell it himself and pay the money. The sale of movable property, together with the seized silver dollars and banknotes, amounted to 6.2 million yuan, all of which went into the cooperative. Only 1.6 million yuan of share certificates were distributed, and no dividends were ever distributed.\n    Cadre situation: The cadres in the village can be divided into three types: The first type is represented by Zhang Zengxian, the vice chairman of the peasant association, and Wang Tianshun, the director of the military committee. Their background is that of bankrupt landlords (not identified by the masses). Their common characteristics are the exploitative ideology of the landlord class and the bullying and ruffian style: not working, eating and drinking extravagantly, gambling, and having illicit relationships with women. They infiltrated the Party and became cadres, doing even more unscrupulous things, oppressing the masses, beating poor and hired peasants to death, provoking discord, and creating chaos in the whole village. The second type is represented by Niu Fushan, the political director. His background is that of a middle peasant. His ideological characteristics are reflected in his eagerness in work and his undemocratic style towards cadres and the masses, looking down on honest cadres and honest peasants. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was resolute in fighting the enemy, and in the anti-traitor movement and the filling-in-the-gaps movement, he was resolute in fighting the landlords and special agents. Generally speaking, he can still carry out the Party's tasks, has a sense of organization, and still retains the nature of a peasant in his lifestyle, working hard and being frugal. The masses' feedback on him is: \"Good at bragging, likes to put on airs!\" The third type is represented by Liu Zhengfu, the director of the peasant association, and Ren Chenggui, the village chief. Their backgrounds are one lower-middle peasant and one poor peasant. Their common characteristics are honesty, not being arrogant, not oppressing the masses, being willing to work, and not being dictatorial in their work. However, because they have always been \"sidekicks\" and lack awareness, they are easily exploited. Liu Zhengfu became close friends with the bankrupt landlord Liu Guangxian. Although he himself did not directly oppress the masses, Liu Guangxian relied on their power to be tyrannical. When Zhang Zengxian, the director of the peasant association, and Wang Tianshun, the director of the military committee, took the lead in opposing Niu Fushan, the political director, they were also exploited. Niu Fushan's work style was undemocratic, and Liu Zhengfu and Ren Chenggui were both dissatisfied with Niu. Zhang and Wang used this point to unite them and encouraged them to take the lead in attacking Niu Fushan together. They didn't work or go to district meetings, and swore oaths to each other, saying that whoever turned to Niu Fushan would suffer the consequences. It wasn't until the recent rectification campaign that their clique was broken up. The honest director of the peasant association and the village chief realized that they had been tricked.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 史二庄地主分子乘机钻进党内　控制支部压迫农民\n\n1948-02-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　史二庄地主分子乘机钻进党内\n  　控制支部压迫农民\n    【本报消息】武安九区史二庄支部已经有了近十年的历史。支部才建立时，曾领导群众对日寇、对地主进行斗争，但是作风却很不民主。以后破落地主、流氓钻进支部，造成严重的党内不纯。他们挑拨支部压制农民，有些本质上较好的党员也受了他们的坏影响。兹将史二庄概况及支部情形报导如下：\n    史二庄是一个相当穷的村子，至今群众口里还流传着这样的话：“要吃面，上伯延；要吃糠，上史二庄”。全村二百九十六户，一千零七口人，三十五顷零二十四亩地，每人平均三亩半，产量平均三石。比较附近的村子，数量和产量都少。地是石厚土薄，四面都是沙石山，山坡地多，一下雨，地里就淤一层沙，群众们说：“史二庄的地都在墙上挂着”。这种地打粮食少，误工大。每年冬季为了积肥，山圪凹里的白草根都要刮光。\n    抗战以前，该村往坡底下（坦岭以东）出过一百八十个长工，到周庄的最多，曾有小史二庄之称。就是现在，被隔离在关外、平津一带的店员和苦力，还有六十八人，村上老少光棍汉还有一百三十七人。\n    抗战前后，全村没有上一顷地的地主，二十九家地主富农的地亩总数，还超不过十顷。但政治经济的统治权却完全操在他们手里。刘正仁、王国清是他们的总头子，群众们说：“他俩，一个顶着史二庄半个天”。\n    三八年冬，该村就有党的秘密小组，党员四人。在准备成立农会时，地主们却先成立起假农会来了。别的村都是五等派款，该村还照样摊派，大部还派在穷人身上。地主们宣传几个贫农活动分子都是赖人，并且把他们的名字编成歌子在街上唱：“张万盛、郭培元，虫钻鼻子（贫农任兴亮的鼻子有毛病）老大年，金旺、虎门不沾弦”。一天夜里，成立农会，刘正仁、王国清带着一伙地主打进会场，并且在路上拦住登记名字。第一次的农会，就这样被他们打散了。\n    三九年春，党员发展至十一人，又重新成立农会，接着斗争了刘正仁。因为他勾结大汉奸李品山，在牛王窊成立“自治军”。把他家里全部浮财都没收了。这个大头子打倒以后，地主们在政治上公开的权力就算基本上摧垮了。经济上经四一年查黑地，清算社头（社头都是地主轮流充当）帐目，及四二年减租减息运动，一部分是大量削弱了，有七家完全垮台了。贫雇有的算得一部分粮食和地，有的贱价买了地主一部分地或当得一部分地。\n    该村的新政权虽然建立得较早，对敌和对地主斗争也很坚决，但作风极不民主，形成一人专主。党、政、武装的大权完全操在流氓出身的郭培元之手。群众说他：“两头瞧不起，瞧不起地主也瞧不起穷人”。不仅群众害怕他，就是干部党员也得完全听他一人指使。谁不和他一心，就踢开谁。老实农民党员被开除出党，破落地主、流氓、中农被大量吸收进来。造成党内不纯，种下了坏根。这时，党员已发展至二十一人，内有贫农二人，中农十七人，破落地主二人。\n    灾荒年，政府发下的救济粮、调剂粮，以及查黑地、清算社头帐目得来的粮食，他愿意给谁吃就给谁吃。这些粮食出入，从未公布过帐目。贫、中农连糠都吃不上，死的死（四二、四三两年死七十多人），逃的逃，他家里（六口人）却断不了吃面、吃肉，并且还养活着一个破鞋。群众说：“老郭要是不死，对他的意见牲口驮也驮不完。算合作社的帐，不如算灾荒年的帐”。\n    “五四”指示以后，郭培元已死，新起来的干部在作风上仍然继承了他的衣钵，独霸专权，欺压群众，代替群众斗争。反奸清算及填平补齐先后斗争了四次，打死特务地主五人，斗争了地主、富农二十五家。用政治名义斗争了十家中农，用土匪名义斗争了贫雇牛秋山，并且打死了他，这个案子现在还没有解决。总共斗出土地二百八十三亩，房子三百零九间。另外有十九家中农因为害怕，献出房子八十七间。\n    这些果实的分配情形是这样：地在数量和产量上大致还平均，干部多是中农，他们分得的总共不到十亩。但少数干部拿坏地换成了好地，部分军属和得势的流氓积极分子都分得了好地，本来好地就少，所以分到贫雇名下的就绝大部分都是赖地了。房子的分配更不公道，好房子是经几个大干部挑了之后，剩余的分给军属。分给贫雇的不仅赖而且少。浮财只是最后分过一次，以往都是卖钱：一、贱价分等卖，贫雇名义上都是头等，有优先权进去买，但手头没钱，好东西还是给二、三等（干部多在二等）买去了。二、抬价钱卖：谁出的钱多，就卖给谁。群众非拿现钱不可，干部却可以欠帐。三、不直接动地主浮财，由他本人变卖交钱。卖浮财连同斗出的现洋、钞票共六百二十万元，都入在合作社，其中只有一百六十万分过股金票，红利一文也没有分过。\n    干部情况：该村干部可以分为三种类型：第一类是以农会副主任张增贤、武委会主任王天顺为代表。他们的成份是破落地主（未经群众划），他们的共同特点是地主阶级的剥削思想和恶霸流氓作风：不劳动，大吃大喝，赌博，乱搞女人。钻进党内，当了干部，更加无所不为，欺压群众，打死贫雇，挑拨是非，把全村造成混乱现象。第二类是以政治主任牛福山为代表，他成份是中农。他的思想特点，表现在工作中是抢先，和对干部群众不民主的作风，瞧不起老实干部和老实农民。但他在抗日时期对敌斗争及在反奸运动与填补运动中对地主特务斗争是坚决的，一般的说，他还能执行党的任务，还有组织观念，生活作风上还保有农民本色，劳动好，节俭。群众对他的反映是：“好称能，好耍态度！”第三类是以农会主任刘正富、村长任成贵为代表，他们的成份一个是下中农，一个是贫农。他们的共同特点是老实，不自高自大，不欺压群众，肯劳动，工作方面都不专主。但由于他们一向是作“陪客”，觉悟不够，因此就易被人利用。刘正富和破落地主刘广先成了亲密的朋友，他自己虽不直接压迫群众，但刘广先却仗着他们的势力横行霸道。当农会主任张增贤、武委会主任王天顺领头，反对政治主任牛福山的时候，他们俩也被利用了。牛福山作风不民主，刘正富、任成贵都对牛不满，张、王就利用这一点，团结了他们，并鼓励他们带头，一同进攻牛福山。不做工作，也不上区开会，互相起誓，谁向了牛福山，谁就会怎样怎样。一直到最近整党，才把他们的一窝蜂打散。老实的农会主任、村长才感到是上了人家的当。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Henan-Shaanxi-Hubei Front, 20th: After universally examining thoughts and work styles while studying Chairman Mao's report, all commanders and fighters of the 38th Army, led by Kong Congzhou of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, have made significant progress. The study began with the cadres. First, Army Commander Kong and Political Commissar Wang Feng conveyed the military and political sections, respectively, in light of the actual conditions of their unit. Then, the regiments gathered cadres to examine their work and thoughts, linking this examination with strategic and tactical thinking and combat style. Everyone was in a state of intense and fervent activity. Many cadres worked tirelessly, reflecting actively, and waging a merciless struggle against the bad thoughts and work styles brought from the old army and the old society. They liquidated the remaining bad habits of warlordism and bureaucracy, eradicated the phenomenon of cadres beating and scolding soldiers, and greatly improved officer-soldier relations. After the study came to a close, cadres at all levels automatically carried their packs to the companies to help with work, mingled with the soldiers, and promoted soldiers to reflect on their actions and examine their leaders. In the general examination of thought, the soldiers combined commendation and merit recording and established company-level soldiers' committees. From the 15th of last month, a certain regiment first had the main cadres of each battalion and company give typical self-criticisms at the soldiers' meeting. The soldiers were deeply moved. Some immediately requested to reflect on their mistakes, and some took the initiative to talk to the instructors about their shortcomings after the meeting. Although the study only lasted four days, it greatly improved revolutionary consciousness, mass discipline, and established the idea of serving the people. At the same time, the companies carried out commendations and merit recording, praising comrades who worked hard, were loyal, and brave. After the establishment of the soldiers' committee, the democratic spirit was fully developed, which was warmly supported by the soldiers. The newly liberated soldiers who had joined the army not long ago were even more deeply moved. Liberated soldier Zhou Daowen said: \"I just came to this army. I originally thought it was the same as the Central Army (Chiang bandits). After this study, I realized that this army is truly for the people. I will stick with this army to the end.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孔从周部学习毛主席报告　查思想后有显著进步\n\n1948-02-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孔从周部学习毛主席报告\n  　查思想后有显著进步\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十日电】西北民主联军第三十八军孔从周部全体指战员在学习毛主席报告中普遍查思想查作风后，获得显著进步。学习先从干部开始，首由孔军长、汪锋政委分别就军事政治部分结合本部队实际进行传达，继由各团集结干部检查工作、检查思想，并联系检查战略战术思想与战斗作风，大家情绪紧张热烈，不少干部废寝忘餐，积极反省，与过去从旧军队旧社会中带来的坏思想坏作风作无情的斗争，清算了残存的军阀主义与官僚主义的恶习，根绝了部分干部中打骂战士的现象，官兵关系大为改善。学习告一段落后，各级干部都自动背背包到连队中帮助工作，与士兵打成一片，并推动战士各自反省与检查领导。战士在普遍查思想中，结合评功记功，并建立连队士兵委员会。某团于上月十五日起，先由各营连的主要干部分别在军人大会上作典型反省，战士深受感动，有的当场要求反省自己的错误，有的会后自动找指导员谈自己的缺点，学习虽仅四天，但大大提高了革命觉悟，群众纪律，建立了为人民服务的思想。各连队同时进行评功记功，对于埋头苦干忠诚勇敢的同志加以表扬。建立士兵委员会后，充分发扬民主精神，获得战士热烈拥护。对于参军不久的新解放战士感动更深。解放战士周道文说：“我是才来本军的，原先以为和中央军（蒋匪）一样，经过这次学习，才认识这个军队真是为人民的。我要在这个军队中干到底”。"

Whether systematic or fragmented, materials or insights; whether in the form of articles, letters, communications, or diaries, any form is acceptable, as long as you write down what you want to say; please avoid Party jargon and empty talk. Other comrades with differing opinions can also write letters to discuss. Each place has its specific circumstances, and the communications published here may not be applicable to every place, but they can be used for reference.\n\n    Before the rectification of the ranks, I had serious landlord-rich peasant thoughts, emotions, and work style; I was the son of a landlord class who had not been well reformed. My thoughts were a confused mess. After three months of study, with the help and education of the Party, I began to recognize myself and the landlord family.\n\n    After studying, I felt that my individual landlord class ideology was very serious. Therefore, I asked the Party to give me a severe punishment, to leave a mark on my landlord class ideology and bad work style, so as to better change this bad ideology and work style in actual work. When accepting the punishment given to me by the Party, my understanding was this: the punishment given by the Party was an education for me, it was a blow to my individual landlord ideology, and it was an encouragement to my Party spirit. Therefore, I was happy after accepting the punishment. At the same time, I also considered that after accepting the punishment, it is necessary to prevent the emergence of two bad tendencies: one is to let the punishment压住压住 (smother) me so that I cannot lift my head up. This would indicate that although I have gone through study, I have not awakened and have not enhanced my Party spirit. This is not the attitude of a class fighter. The second is that I feel that the punishment given to me by the Party is nothing, nothing great. This tendency is that I have not been vigilant about my serious landlord class ideology. Neither of these two things is the correct attitude towards the punishment given to me by the Party. In the future, no matter which tendency I develop, if it continues to develop, it will take me out of the revolutionary camp and all the way to the path of death.\n\n    After rectifying the ranks, I realized that this study is only the beginning of transforming my personal stance and ideology. In the future, I should pay more attention to constantly and ruthlessly打击打击 (strike) the revival of my landlord class ideology. Therefore, I made up my mind to go to the masses to temper myself, but who knew that my motivation to make up my mind was still somewhat impure! There is a kind of personal \"not convinced\" feeling, thinking that \"I was wrong in the past, look at me in the future.\" This is obviously not a truly serve-the-poor-and-hired attitude. This attitude is still standing on the original landlord class position. Finally, with the help of other comrades, I established a correct attitude. I considered preventing the non-correct attitude of \"being angry\" or \"not convinced\" after studying. The correct attitude should be an honest attitude, constantly and actively working. Establish the attitude of \"learning everything from scratch,\" \"tempering myself in actual work,\" and \"willing to be a primary school student of the masses.\"\n\n    In this period of practical work, I have gained new things that I have never heard of before. These new things make me feel excited and happy. However, in the actual work process, I also exposed the tail of my personal landlord ideology.\n\n    Accepting the review of poor and lower-middle peasants and working under their supervision. When I visited the Duan Tianzeng couple, after two conversations, Duan Tianzeng only said some very superficial things about himself and the simple situation in the village. At that time, he showed a lot of fear. During the conversation, when he heard the sound of someone walking outside, he would stop talking. The third time I went to his house, it happened that his wife was also at home. At this time, Tianzeng's wife kept looking at me. She said that I didn't look like a farmer, but like someone from a military unit. At that time, I clearly told her: In the future, we will implement a new method—equally distributing the land and letting the poor be the masters. She said: She also heard her son say that a new method would be implemented. This shows that I came here to find poor people to do this. After such a conversation, the couple seemed a little distrustful of me. She looked at me and asked where I was from, who was in my family, and how much land I cultivated. At that time, I was a little unhappy, thinking that I had come to do things for you wholeheartedly, why ask me so many details? Later, I thought that this was because they didn't trust me, so I told her that when she heard that my family was also old money, they both became indignant and stared at me. She asked me again, what about your family! Do you still have parents? I also explained to her that the family is old money, and old money oppresses and persecutes the poor. I no longer recognize that as my home... Although after such an explanation, the atmosphere between each other was still not very harmonious. At this time, the old man Tianzeng asked me where I lived and whether I had found the village cadres. I told him that I had found a place myself, but I couldn't see any of the village cadres. Immediately afterwards, I said that I had just come here and didn't know anyone, so I was afraid of finding the wrong poor people, and hoped to help find some poor people. After such a conversation, the couple felt a little relieved and told me a lot of things. Another time, I took a few autumn grain public grain account books from the cooperative. The poor peasant Yinghui Niang asked me who I wanted them for? What did you say to the cadres? What did the cadres say to you? She questioned me in detail. At that time, I also felt in my heart that she didn't trust me too much, and she was not relieved that I was taking an account book. Another time, I found a person to talk to, who used to be the village chief (I didn't know it at the time). The poor peasant Tujin stared at me and asked, who told you to find him? He is a有法的有法的 (law-abiding)... The supervision of me was very severe, and at that time, I simply thought that the poor and hired's review and supervision of me was that the poor and hired should not distrust me. I did not examine myself. I was born in a landlord class family. I only said in my mouth that I had come to do things for the poor and hired peasants. They would not believe it. Therefore, they should and must review and supervise me. Otherwise, how could they believe you? Especially since I had no concept of the poor and hired in the past, the poor and hired regarded you as someone who oppressed them. When you say that you sincerely serve them, the poor and hired must review and supervise you to see if you are sincere or insincere.\n\n    Waiting for the awakening of the poor and hired, breaking their ideological concerns, and gradually combining with them emotionally. Through Duan Tianzeng's introduction, I visited the three-generation carpenter Duan Guangyun. The first time I went, he showed fear and dared not say anything. I explained the Land Law to him, and in the future, the poor would be the masters, but he always said \"那可照那可照\" (that can be done/good idea). If I didn't speak, he wouldn't say anything either, which made me a little anxious again. I still considered that I came to serve you sincerely, why don't you want to talk to me? But then I thought that being anxious would not solve the problem. I had no choice but to chat about other things. If I continued to ask, I was afraid of causing him more anxiety. I didn't think about how to break his ideological concerns and wait for him. The second time I went to find him, he still didn't want to say anything. At this time, I stopped asking him and asked him what he was doing today. He said he was going to pick up some firewood. I seized this opportunity to tell him that I would help him. He said: Huh! Can I ask comrades to accompany me to suffer this hardship! After explaining, I went to pick up firewood with him. In the process of picking up firewood, he was still uneasy, saying some polite words. I felt that he was hypocritical, and always thought that I was picking up firewood for him sincerely. After this firewood picking, the emotions of both parties got a little closer. Later, I often went to his house to help with some odd jobs, and no longer actively asked him about other things. After three or four days, because I found other poor and hired people, I didn't go to his place, but he would come to find me once a day, without saying anything, just taking a look and leaving. Slowly, he told me about his pain and the situation in the village. I knew Duan Tingyu, who was introduced by his mother herself (Duan Tingyu is Duan Tianzeng's son). Therefore, I thought he would definitely believe me. Every time I talked, I would explain it to break his ideological concerns. After four or five conversations, I felt that the emotional bond between the two parties was almost there. Later, he said to Tujin: It's bad, that person (referring to me) is from the newspaper office. He came to investigate and then publish it in the newspaper. If the cadres see it, they will retaliate. This is bad, \"没有打了狐子白落了一片骚没有打了狐子白落了一片骚(killing no fox but getting your hands smeared with fox urine)\" After I knew about this, I felt distressed. I treat you like this and it still doesn't work. How can you believe me? I didn't check this issue from my personal thoughts. I didn't wait enough for the poor peasants. I made a rash move. Especially since Tingyu suffered blows from the village cadres because he made suggestions in the cadre-mass relationship movement, his ideological concerns were relatively large. If I didn't think about opening his mind or waiting for him, his ideological problems would not be solved. I thought that as long as I sincerely did things for them, all problems would be solved. I lived in Zhang Tujin's house and also showed my impatience. When Tujin was polite to me, I was very unhappy. For example, when sleeping, Tujin's quilt was much thinner than mine, but he always asked me to sleep in a warm place and cover myself with his cotton jacket. I was impatient and thought that he shouldn't treat me so politely. It wasn't until later that he asked me to help with some things that I felt happy in my heart. I didn't check these issues. Why would the poor and hired treat me like this? I didn't realize that the poor and hired saw the workers as different, thinking that the workers were \"officials,\" especially since my personal work style hadn't completely changed. Therefore, they treated me so politely.\n\n    After truly combining with the poor and hired emotionally, the poor and hired will criticize you unceremoniously for things that are not right. Once when I was with Zhang Tujin, I wanted to throw away the crushed tobacco crumbs because there was dirt in them. He said that I was throwing away the tobacco for nothing, just like the old money. Another time, I was organizing his materials. After I finished writing, I read it to him. Originally, it was a matter of distributing a torn mourning garment. I wrote that I had distributed a set of mourning garments. He raised an objection and said, \"That one was given to me by you. I distributed a torn mourning garment. I said it several times and you can't remember it.\" At that time, I felt sad in my heart, resenting why I didn't pay attention to these details! Compared with Tujin, I am far behind.\n\n    After this period of work, I had a one-sided view of the poor and hired. I overly believed in the poor and hired, thinking that the poor and hired had good components and their class nature was strong in seeing problems. I didn't see their backward side. This was mainly manifested in the issue of village cadres and middle peasants. At first, I consciously ignored the village cadres, especially when there were poor and hired people present. I put on airs. In terms of attitude towards the middle peasants, I felt that I hadn't gained the trust of the poor and hired yet, so I couldn't carry out middle peasant work. Especially when there were not many poor and hired people, I thought this way. I haven't found the poor and hired yet, so where do I have the mind to find the middle peasants? Therefore, what was shown was that I didn't treat the middle peasants as closely and generously as I treated the poor and hired, and I didn't treat the village cadres as closely and generously as I treated the middle peasants. I was always worried in my mind that I would alienate my relationship with the poor and hired because of doing middle peasant work. This kind of thinking is a \"leftist\" manifestation of myself.\n\n    × × × × × × Comrades participating in land distribution from various places:\n    After you arrive in the village, how do you approach the poor and hired? How do you publicize the Land Law and carry out work? What problems and difficulties have you encountered in your work? How did you solve them? What mistakes have you made? How did you correct them? What experiences do you have? After you have rectified the Party, what changes and gains have you made in your thinking in the test of the movement? What are the characteristics of the work in each village? What specific problems do you have? Please write to the newspaper in a timely manner. We will publish it in the largest space in the future.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　— The Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 整顿队伍以后  工作中的思想初步检查\n力明\n1948-02-22\n第2版()\n专栏：工作通讯\n\n　　整顿队伍以后\n    工作中的思想初步检查\n    力明\n    我们以最大的篇幅，欢迎边区各地参加土地改革工作的同志们交流工作情况，交换工作意见，研究工作问题，集中多方面意见然后加以共同解决。系统的也好，片断的也好，材料也好，心得也好；用写文章的形式也好，写信的形式也好，写通讯记日记的形式也好，不拘什么形式都好，把要说的话写出来就可以；千万不要党八股客里空。别的同志有不同的意见，也可以写信来讨论。一个地方有一个地方的具体情况，这里发表的通讯不一定对每个地方都适用，但可供大家参考。　\n    在未整顿队伍前，我存在着严重的地富思想、情感及作风，是一个未经很好改造的地主阶级的儿子。思想模糊的乌七八糟，经过三个月的学习，在党的帮助教育之下，自己才开始认识了自己，认识了地主家庭。\n    经过学习后感到个人的地主阶级思想是很严重的，因此自己要求党给自己以严重的处分，给自己的地主阶级思想及坏的作风留一记号，以便在实际工作中更好的改变这种不良的思想作风。在接受党给予自己的处分时，自己是这种认识的：党给予的处分是对我的一个教育，是打击了个人的地主思想，是鼓舞了我的党性的一面。因此个人在接受处分后是愉快的。同时也考虑到，接受处分后，要防止两种不良的倾向的产生：一种是叫处分压住自己抬不起头来，这样就表明自己虽然经过学习而没有觉悟起来，没有增强自己的党性，这样不是一个阶级战士的姿态，第二种是个人感到党给自己的处分不算什么，没有什么了不起，这种倾向是使咱对自己的严重的地主阶级的思想性还未警惕起来，这两种东西都不是对待党给予自己处分的正确态度。今后不管自己产生哪一种倾向，使其发展下去，会将自己走出革命阵营以外，一直走到死亡的道路。\n    经过整顿队伍后，自己认识到：这次学习仅仅是转变个人立场、思想的开始，今后更应注意不断的、无情的打击自己地主阶级思想的复活。因此自己下了决心到群众中去锻炼，但谁知自己下了决心动机还有些不纯！有一种个人“不服气”，认为“过去错了今后看”，这很显然自己还不是真正为贫雇服务的态度，这种态度仍是站在原来的地主阶级立场上的。最后，在别的同志帮助下，才树立起正确的态度，自己才考虑到今后防止学习后个人“赌气”或者“不服气”那种非正确的态度，正确的应该是老老实实的态度，经常的积极工作下去。树立起“一切从头学起”，“到实际工作中去锻炼”，“甘心当群众的小学生”的态度。\n    在这一段实际工作中，自己获得从所未闻过新的东西，这种新的东西使自己感到兴奋愉快。但在实际工作过程中，也暴露了个人的地主思想的尾巴。\n    接受贫苦农民的审查，在贫苦农民的监督下进行工作。我访问段天增夫妇时，经过两次的谈话，段天增才将自己事情及村里简单情况很皮毛的说了一些，当时他表现了很骇怕，谈话中，听到外边有走路声音，他就停下来不说了。第三次我去他家时，赶上他老婆也在家，这时天增媳妇一直在看我，她说我不象庄稼人，是部队机关里的，当时我也就明白的告诉了她：以后实行新办法——平分土地，叫穷人当家做主。她说：也听她儿子说要实行新办法。说明我来这里就是找穷人办这个事情。经过这样谈话后，她夫妇俩有些不相信我的样子，她看着我，问是哪里的，家里有什么人，种多少地。我当时思想有些不高兴，以为自己决心为你们办事情来了，问我这样详细干啥，后来想到这是对我不放心，于是我就告诉了她，听说家庭也是老财的时候，她俩个态度上都愤发了，在一边瞪着眼睛看着我。她又问我你家里怎样啦！你还有爹娘没有？我随着也给她解释，家庭是老财，老财都是欺压迫害穷人的，我不再认那是我的家……。虽然经过这样的解释，但互相之间空气仍不十分调和，这时天增老汉又问我住在哪里，找村干部了没有，我给他说自己找的地方，村干部一个也不见，紧接着提出我才来这里，一个人也不认识，找穷人怕找错了，希望帮助找一些穷人。经过这样的谈话后，她夫妇才有些放心，给我说了不少的事情。又一次我在合作社拿了几本秋季公粮粮帐，贫农英会娘就问我给谁要的？你给干部说啥话啦？干部给你说了些啥？把我详详细细的追问了一番，当时自己思想上也感到她太不相信我了，拿本帐对我也不放心。又一次找了一个人谈话，这个人过去当过村长（当时不知道），贫农土金就瞪着眼睛问我，谁叫你找他哩？他是个有法的………对我监视非常利害，而我当时思想上将贫雇对我的审查和监视单纯的认为贫雇不应该不相信我，没有从自己本身来检查，自己是从地主阶级出身，仅仅在嘴里说为贫雇农民办事情来了，他们是不会相信的，因此他们对我应该而且必然的要审查和监视，不然他们对你怎么能够相信呢？特别是过去自己根本就没有贫雇观念，贫雇把你看成压迫他的人，当你说真心为他们服务的时候，贫雇一定要审查和监视着你，考察你是真心还是假意。\n    等待贫雇的觉悟，打破他们思想顾虑，在情感上慢慢结合起来。经段天增介绍，我访问了三辈子木工段光云。我第一次去，他表现怕，什么都不敢说。我给他解释土地法，以后叫穷人当家，但他都是说“那可照”（好的意见）。我不说话他也不吭声，因此使自己又有些急燥，仍然考虑到自己是诚心诚意为你服务来了，怎么不愿意给我说话呢？但又想到光急燥办不了事情，只好闲扯别的事情，如果再继续问怕引起他更大的不安，没有想到如何打破他的思想顾虑，等待他一下。第二次找他去了，他仍然不愿说什么。这时我就不再问他了，问他今天干啥活，他说准备拾把柴火去，我就抓紧这个机会给他说我也帮你去，他说：咦！还能叫同志陪伴着我受这个苦哩！经过解释后，和他算一块拾柴去了。在拾柴的当中，他仍然不安，说些客气话，自己感到他虚伪了，老想自己给他拾柴是诚心诚意的。经过这次拾柴，双方的情感有些靠拢，以后我常去他家里，帮助做个零活，再不主动的问他别的事情。过了三、四天后，因为我又找到别的贫雇，没有去他那里，而他每天要找我一趟，也不说什么看一看就走，慢慢的才将他的痛苦及村里的情况告诉了我。我认识段廷玉，是他娘亲自介绍的（段廷玉即段天增的儿子），因此认为他一定会相信我，每次谈话，我都是解释一番想打破他思想顾虑，经过四、五次谈话，感到双方情感结合，还差不多，后来他对土金说：坏了，人家（指我）是报馆里的，他来调查了事就登报，报纸叫干部看见了，又要报复吧，这一下子可坏了，“没有打了狐子白落了一片骚”。我知道这个事情以后，思想感到苦闷，我这样对待你还不行，到底怎样才能相信我呢？没有从个人思想来检查这个问题，自己对贫苦农民等待不够，犯了急性病，特别是廷玉在干群关系运动中，因提意见遭到村干部的打击，思想顾虑比较大，不想法打通思想或等待他，他思想问题是不会解决的。认为只要诚恳的为他们办事情，啥问题也解决了。我住在张土金家里，也表现了个人性急，土金对自己客气时，自己就很不高兴，例如睡觉时，土金的被子比我的被子薄的多，但他老叫我睡热地方、盖他的棉袄，自己不耐烦，认为他不应该这样客气对待我。直到后来，他有些事情叫我帮助做，思想上才愉快了，对这些问题，没有检查，贫雇为什么会这些对待自己，不认识贫雇把工作员看成二样的，认为工作员是“官”特别是个人的作风还未彻底转变。因而对待我就这样客气。\n    真正和贫雇在感情上结合起来以后，贫雇对你不对的地方会不客气的批评。我和张土金在一块，一次是因为碎烟沫有土，想抛掉，他说我把烟白白扔了和老财一样。又一次整理他的材料，写完后我读给他听，原来是分一件破孝衣，我写的是分了一身孝衣，他就提出意见来了，他说：“那一件是你给我的，分了一件破孝衣，说了好几回你就记不住。”当时自己思想上感到难过，怨恨自己在这些地方为什么就注意不到呢！以个人和土金来比，差的太远了。\n    经过这一段工作，自己思想上又产生了片面的贫雇观点，过分的相信贫雇，认为贫雇成份好，他们看问题阶级性强，没有看他们落后的一面，这主要表现在对村干部及中农问题上，开始对村干部有意识的不理他们，特别有贫雇在场时，自己摆着架子，对中农态度上，认为还没有获得贫雇的信任，不能进行中农工作，特别是贫雇不多的时候，自己就这样想，贫雇还未找到，哪里有心思找中农去，因此，表现出来的对中农没有对待贫雇近厚，对村干没有对待中农近厚，自己思想老顾虑到，不要因为做中农工作而疏远了和贫雇的关系，这种思想是自己“左”一种表现。\n    ×　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　　×　　　　×　　　　　×各地参加土地平分的同志：\n    你们到村后，如何接近贫雇？如何宣传土地法开展工作？工作中经到些什么问题和困难？如何解决的？犯了些什么错误？如何纠正？有些什么经验？你们自整党后，在运动的考验中思想有何变化和收获？各村工作面貌特点如何？有些什么具体问题？都请你们及时写给报纸，我们今后将用最大篇幅发表。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "How to Unite Middle Peasants in Production?\n　　The Reply of the Tongtan Work Group and the Opinion of This Newspaper\n　　On January 25th, this newspaper published news from the Second Commissioner's Office Work Group regarding the implementation of the poor and hired peasant line in Tongtan Town, Zuoquan County. The village cadres examined the fact that they had not followed the \"poor and hired peasant line\" in winter production, and therefore decided on three measures: first, understand and solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants; second, organize the poor and hired peasants to do whatever they are good at; third, let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is most profitable. At that time, this newspaper believed that this way of following the \"poor and hired peasant line\" did not conform to the Party's policy of relying on poor and hired peasants and uniting middle peasants. Therefore, we put forward opinions and asked the Tongtan Work Group to check.\n　　In early February, this newspaper received a timely review and response from the comrades of the work group. The gist of their reply was: In the past winter production, the mobilization and organization of poor and hired peasants were neglected. Therefore, discussions were held among the cadres, \"requiring the implementation of the poor and hired peasant line in January to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants and organize the production of poor and hired peasants to meet their demands.\" In terms of practices, in addition to organizing some poor and hired peasants to participate in transportation, semi-able-bodied laborers had no way out. Because some of them had run stores, and some of the stores opened by the mutual aid society were extravagant and wasteful, one was a \"feudal\" manager, and two were middle peasants. The leadership composition was not good, and the masses were dissatisfied, so they thought about the need to transform the stores. A meeting of poor and hired peasants was convened. After deliberation, it was decided that seventeen households would participate. Subsequently, a meeting of middle and poor peasant cooperative members was held, proposing to organize the poor and hired peasants to open stores and withdraw 200,000 yuan of funds for other production. The masses accepted this and approved the opening of stores by the seventeen poor and hired peasant households. After the transformation, the poor and hired peasant stores were very profitable. The shares withdrawn from the stores were used for other production, which was more profitable than running the stores, and the middle peasants were very satisfied. In addition, the transportation of middle peasants was also organized, without infringing upon the interests of the middle peasants. At the same time, it was also mentioned: \"Because this manuscript is about studying the 'poor and hired peasant line', not about 'how poor and hired peasants unite middle peasants in production', therefore, we believe that the title: 'One-sided emphasis on the interests of poor and hired peasants' is a bit too affirmative and somewhat different from the focus of the original manuscript.\" We appreciate the research spirit of the Tongtan Work Group, but we also believe that there are some issues of principle that are worth discussing. Therefore, we sent a letter directly to the work group, raising several questions, such as: Is it appropriate to say \"let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is most profitable\"? Is it appropriate for the seventeen poor and hired peasants to accept all the stores of the mutual aid society and exclude the leadership composition of the middle peasants? ...... and so on.\n　　On February 15th, we received a reply from the comrades of the work group. First of all, they believed that the criticism in the first letter that the title was too affirmative was incorrect, because they themselves had not properly checked their work. Their letter said: \"We are very anxious about the production of poor and hired peasants, but we only help middle peasants with livestock, and we don't know much about and haven't organized help for middle peasant households without livestock, that is to say, we haven't done it. We emphasized taking care of the interests of poor and hired peasants.\" \"Through this writing, we realized that attention should be paid to the way questions are raised and to seeing problems one-sidedly.\" In the first question, their examination was: \"Let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is profitable.\" Although it did not form a slogan among the masses, in practice, it emphasized taking care of the poor and hired peasants and neglected the middle peasants who had difficulties. On the issue of stores, they believed that the transformation was voluntary by the middle peasants, and that the poor and hired peasants spent less and could make money by opening stores. Second question: The shares of the five stores were all accepted by the poor and hired peasants, and the funds were mainly the fruits of struggle, which were operated by the mutual aid team. The mutual aid society provided capital to support the value. When the poor and hired peasants accepted it, the mutual aid society had already withdrawn its shares. Third question: Regarding the issue of poor and hired peasants in power uniting middle peasants, they believed that there were achievements in solving the difficulties of poor and hired peasants and mobilizing the production of poor and hired peasants. The production of middle peasants has been organized into mutual aid groups, but the leadership composition has not been resolved.\n　　From the entire process of our two studies with the Tongtan Work Group on the class line in production, we believe that this study is very good. They provided a lot of materials, which helped us a lot. In order to seek complete agreement on this issue, we put forward the following opinions for joint discussion with the comrades of the Tongtan Work Group and readers who are concerned about this issue.\n　　1. Before the poor and hired peasants can completely turn over and become masters, we must first care about and solve the practical difficulties of the poor and hired peasants in order to mobilize and organize production. The starting point of the comrades of the Tongtan Work Group is completely correct. However, when solving the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants, the interests of the middle peasants must not be harmed in the slightest. The saying \"Let the poor and hired peasants do whatever is profitable\" is wrong. Doing so will inevitably harm the interests of the middle peasants. For the voluntary issue of the middle peasants, we cannot be satisfied with the superficial form of voluntariness. This voluntariness is often compulsory in substance. The leadership must never be confused by this. It should be to solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants and unite the middle peasants to produce together.\n　　2. In leading and mobilizing production, we must and should solve the difficulties of the poor and hired peasants. Forgetting the poor and hired peasants is wrong. But from the perspective of the leadership composition of production, and from the entire process of organizing and mobilizing production, we must never exclude the middle peasants. On the contrary, we also need to greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the middle peasants on the basis of mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the poor and hired peasants. Without the participation and leadership of the middle peasants in the production team, it is impossible to do well.\n　　3. Regarding the specific practices of transforming stores in Tongtan Town, we believe that specific research can be done in combination with the above opinions. The idea of talking about composition in this kind of store opening still needs to be considered. Middle peasants opening stores does not necessarily mean that they will open them badly. This is \"component-ism\", which will limit the mobilization of the production enthusiasm of the middle peasants and develop a one-sided view of the poor and hired peasants. In fact, it is not beneficial to the poor and hired peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 生产中如何团结中农？  桐滩工作组的答复与本报的意见\n\n1948-02-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　生产中如何团结中农？\n    桐滩工作组的答复与本报的意见\n    本报一月二十五日曾发表二专署工作组寄来的左权桐滩镇生产中执行贫雇路线的消息。该村干部检讨了冬季生产中没有走“贫雇路线”，因此便决定三个办法：第一是了解与解决贫雇困难；第二是贫雇会干啥就组织啥；第三是什么利最大，就让贫雇干。当时本报认为这样走“贫雇路线”是不符合党的依靠贫雇、团结中农的方针的，因此便提出意见，请桐滩工作组检查。\n    二月初，本报接到工作组同志的及时检查与回答，他们答复中的大意是：过去冬季生产，忽视了贫雇的发动与组织，因此在干部中做了讨论，“要求在一月份要贯彻贫雇路线，解决贫雇困难。组织贫雇生产，来满足贫雇要求。”在作法上，除组织一部分贫雇参加运输外，半辅助劳力没出路，因为其中有人开过店，而互助社所开的店房中有的很铺张浪费，一个是“封建”当经理，两个是中农。领导成份不好，群众不满，便想到需要改造店房的问题。召开了贫雇会，经过酝酿，决定十七户参加。随后召开了中贫农社员大会，提出组织贫雇开，并抽出二十万元资金搞其他生产，群众接受了，批准了那十七户贫雇开店。改造后，贫雇店很赚钱。从店房中抽回的股金作其他生产，比开店时还赚钱，中农很满意，此外还组织了中农运输，并未侵犯中农利益。同时也提到：“由于这个稿子，我们是研究‘贫雇路线’，不是谈‘贫雇如何团结中农生产’，因此认为标题上：‘片面强调贫雇利益’有些太肯定，和原稿的重点有些不一样。”我们对桐滩工作组这种研究精神感到很好，但在某些带有原则性质的问题上我们也认为有值得商榷的地方，因此便直接给工作组去信，提了几个问题。譬如“什么利最大就让贫雇干”，这样的提法是否妥当？十七个贫雇是否接受互助社全部店房，排斥中农领导成份是否合适…………？等。\n    二月十五日，我们接到了工作组同志的答复，首先他们认为第一次来信中提到的认为标题太肯定的批评是不对的，因为他们自己没从工作上好好检查。他们信上说：“我们对贫雇生产很着急，而对中农只是帮助有牲口的，对没有牲口的中农户了解不多，组织帮助不够，也就是说没有做。对贫雇的利益强调照顾。”“经过这次写稿，体会到问题的提法与片面看问题的应该注意”。在第一个问题他们的检查是：“什么有利就让贫雇干”，虽没有形成群众的口号，但在作法上是强调照顾贫雇，对有困难的中农是忽视的。在店房问题上，他们认为改造是中农的自愿，贫雇开店花销省，能赚钱。第二个问题：五个店房的股金全归贫雇接受，资金主要是斗争果实，由互助队经营，互助社出资本来扶值，归贫雇接受时，互助社股金已抽了股。第三个问题：关于贫雇当权团结中农的问题，他们认为在解决贫雇困难、发动贫雇生产上看是有成绩的，中农生产都已组织到互助组内，就是领导成份问题没解决。\n    从我们两次与桐滩工作组研究生产中的阶级路线的整个经过看，我们认为这次的研究很好，他们提供很多的材料，对我们帮助很大；为了将这个问题求得认识上的完全一致，特提出以下的意见与桐滩工作组同志及关心这一问题的读者，共同商讨。\n    一、在贫雇农未能彻底翻身当家之前，我们要发动与组织生产，就首先必须关心与解决贫雇农的切身困难，桐滩工作组同志的出发点完全是对的。但当解决贫雇困难的时候，丝毫不能损害中农利益。“什么有利就让贫雇干”的提法是错误的，这样做的结果，势必损害中农利益。对于中农自愿问题，不能满足于表面的形式的自愿，这种自愿往往是以强迫为实质的。领导上决不能迷惑这一点，应该是解决贫雇困难，团结中农，一道生产。\n    二、在领导与发动生产中我们必须而且应该解决贫雇困难，忘了贫雇是错误的。但从生产的领导成份上讲，从组织与发动生产的全过程讲，我们绝不能排斥中农，相反的，我们还需要在贫雇农生产热情发动的基础上，大大的鼓舞中农的热情，生产队伍里，没有中农的参加与领导，是不可能做得好的。\n    三、关于桐滩镇改造店房等具体作法上的问题，我们认为可结合以上意见，再作具体研究。这种开店也要讲成份的提法与思想还可考虑，中农开店不一定就开坏，这是“唯成份论”，这样会限制了中农生产热情的发动，发展了片面的贫雇观点，其实对贫雇是无利的。"

Since the beginning of this year, Donets miners have broken and created new coal mining records ten times, marking an unprecedented surge in production competition in the region. On February 13th alone, Tolonkov, a worker at the Kalinin Coal Trust in Gorlovka, set a historic new record of mining 426 tons of coal in seven hours, breaking his own previous record of 211 tons of coal set two weeks earlier, but within three days, his fellow miner Shalnekov broke his new record again. This fiercely competitive movement has been widely reported in the Soviet newspapers and is considered a prelude to the great achievements of the third year of the Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan.

The mechanization of production has greatly increased worker productivity. For example, the average output of a coal mining machine in a certain coal mine in Donbas was 10,300 tons in December last year, but now, Stakhanovite workers have increased it to 14,000 to 15,000 tons. Soviet factories have begun to manufacture coal mining and loading machines in large quantities for the complete mechanization of the coal mining process. This is a masterpiece of Soviet engineers, which can automatically excavate and transport coal to the conveyor belt. Last year, Donbas coal miners also designed new air drilling machines and powerful loading machines. The Soviet industry has begun to manufacture new electric locomotives and conveyor belts.

They organized a study group to collectively study the Central Bureau's \"Letter to Party Members,\" the Border Region Farmers' Association Preparatory Committee's \"Letter to Farmers,\" and the Border Government's Regulations on Punishing Corruption. While studying, they reflected on their past shortcomings and mistakes. They also put forward slogans such as: \"Unburden yourself and hand over to the poor and hired peasants for dismantling, washing, and cleaning,\" and \"Pretending to be clever and trying to be sloppy will never escape the eyes of the masses.\" After a period of study, they began to review. Zhang Heting, the director of the Farmers' Association from a poor peasant background, reviewed and said: During the land reform movement the year before last, our cadres all wanted to take more when distributing fruits, and there was no way to solve it. Later, district cadre Zhang Fuming spent three days and three nights having each of us pull a good donkey, saying that the masses \"supported\" it, and that's how the problem was solved. One night, I met public security officer Fan Deqing and political director Fan Youtang (now the manager of the cooperative). Deqing said, \"We all want to take more fruit, and we even have disagreements, which is really bad. I think we should open the door of the fruit storage group and all take a few clothes to wear, and that's it.\" The three of us hit it off, and we pretended to check whether the accounts registered by the storekeeper Fan Yutang were clear, and we tried to get them on our side. We also called two other cadres, a total of eight people, and opened the door of the clothing storage room. We went in, opened the packages, and each of us picked out a set of clothes, stealing the fruits of the masses. I took four cotton coats, and also embezzled forty catties of black beans and a cloth bag. This was a big mistake. After Zhang Heting's review, Fan Youtang also reviewed and said: \"I stole a robe and two cotton trousers.\" Women's Federation Chairman Feng Gaiying also reviewed that she had stolen two mandarin jackets, a pair of floral cotton trousers, and a washbasin. The three storekeepers also made reviews. Minjiao Director Fan Dehe (currently a public security officer) also reviewed that he had stolen a pair of cotton trousers, a shirt, and a bed sheet. They collectively stole the fruits of the masses and were afraid that the masses would find problems when checking the accounts, so Deqing asked the secretary to tear off a page of the fruit account book to confuse the masses. They were also afraid that other cadres who had not stolen would expose them, so they organized a second night-time fruit theft, with a total of ten people, each stealing a piece of clothing. Only then did they feel relieved, and the remaining rotten things were distributed to the masses. Other mistakes are still being reviewed. They are prepared to openly admit their mistakes to the masses during the fair distribution, and sincerely ask the masses to examine them. The masses generally responded well when they heard that the cadres were voluntarily making reviews. Poor peasant Guo Lin said: \"We speak the truth and talk about the facts. As long as the cadres turn back and do a good job for the masses, we still want them!\" Middle peasant Guo Laifu said: \"As long as the cadres take out the stolen and over-occupied fruits and do a good job, we don't necessarily have to replace them.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西豆庄干部集体学习　自动检讨过去错误\n\n1948-02-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西豆庄干部集体学习\n  　自动检讨过去错误\n    【太行消息】涉县西豆庄干部听党和群众的话，开始老老实实检讨自己的错误。他们组织了一个学习组，集体学习中央局的“告党员书”、边区农会筹委会的“告农民书”和边府惩治贪污条例等文件。一面学习，一面反省自己过去的缺点和错误。并提出：“有包袱快解开交贫雇拆洗打扫”，“假装聪明想马虎，总出不了群众的手心”等口号。学习了一个时期，就检讨起来了。贫农出身的农会主任张何廷检讨说：前年土地改革运动中，咱干部们在分果实时，都想多分，没办法解决。后来区干部张甫明用了三天三夜，叫咱们每人拉了个好驴，说是群众“拥护”，才算解决了这个问题。有一天夜里，我遇见公安员樊德清、政治主任樊有堂（现合作社经理），德清说：“咱们都想多分点果实，还闹下意见，真不好。我看咱去把保管果实组门弄开，都拿几件衣裳穿穿，就没啥了。”俺三人言投意合，就假借检查保管员樊玉堂登记的帐清不清，生法与他们拉成一气，又叫来两个干部，碰在一块共八个人，将保管衣服的房门弄开，进去拆开包袱，你拣一身，我挑一件，偷取了群众的果实。我拿了四件棉衣，还贪污过四十斤黑豆，一条布袋，这真是大错。张何廷检讨后，樊有堂也检讨说：“我偷过一件袍子、两条棉裤。”妇女会主席冯改英也检讨出偷过两件马褂、一条花棉裤，还偷了个洗脸盆。三个保管员也都作了检讨。民教主任樊德和（现任公安员）也检讨出偷过一条棉裤、一个衫子，一个衬单。他们集体偷了群众的果实，怕群众查帐出岔子，德清就叫书记把果实帐撕掉一张，来迷弄群众。又怕其他没偷的干部说出他们，就又组织了个二次下夜偷果实，共十人，每人偷了一件衣服。这才算放了心，剩下些烂东西分给了群众。其他错误还正在检讨中。他们准备平分时公开向群众承认错误，诚心诚意的叫群众审查。群众听说干部在自动作检讨，一般反映都很好。贫雇郭林的说：“咱们是讲真理谈实话，只要干部回头好好替群众办事，咱还是要他们哩！”中农郭来富说：“干部们只要把偷的与多占的果实拿出来，还好好干工作，咱也不一定要撤换他们。”"

    "content": "Border Region Government Issues Urgent Directive\n　　Combine Land Reform with Spring Planting Preparations\n　　[News from this newspaper] Spring planting is approaching, and the Border Region Government has issued a special directive to urgently prepare for spring planting. The directive states: Spring has begun, and spring planting work must be urgently prepared. Due to the war entering a counter-offensive phase and the deepening of land reform, favorable conditions have been created for this year's spring planting. However, it is estimated that in most areas of our region, land redistribution will occur around the time of spring planting. Therefore, spring planting must be carried out in conjunction with land reform as the main focus, in order to ensure that agricultural seasons are not missed, early planting is carried out, land is not left barren, and efforts are made to increase the yield per mu by three sheng of fine grain this year. Time is running out! We must immediately start organizing spring planting preparations. In the preparations, we must also pay attention to preventing spring famine and solving the difficulties in disaster-stricken areas. Regarding spring planting work, we put forward the following suggestions for reference and implementation:\n 甲. Our region has a severe shortage of livestock. After the peasants have been allotted land, livestock has become an extremely important requirement. The solution: First, combine the property distributed to the peasants with agricultural loans to carry out large-scale livestock purchases. The source of livestock is firstly from the government contacting friendly neighboring regions that produce livestock. Without affecting their land laws, agree on the possible quantity of imports, and carry out organized, mass-based bartering with our region's exportable materials (the government has already conducted consultations, and each district can also consider doing so). Second, protect existing livestock and prevent spring epidemics. In addition to the efforts of the Agricultural College of Peking University to train and transform new and old veterinarians, governments at all levels should strengthen the education and transformation of old veterinarians, promote apprenticeship, and cultivate new veterinary talents who are loyal to serving the people. Third, strictly prohibit the illegal slaughter of livestock and prohibit exports. Governments at all levels and trade departments must strictly inspect this.\n 乙. Replenish agricultural implements. Governments at all levels should have a planned organization of blacksmith shops to repair and manufacture agricultural implements. To complete this work, trade departments should assist cooperatives in organizing purchases from regions that produce agricultural implements. Advocate the method of ordering ironware for cooperatives, and encourage poor peasants to jointly purchase large agricultural implements (such as drills and harrows). Reward improvements in manufacturing. Relevant industrial departments should also vigorously support this.\n 丙. Due to last year's disaster and land changes after land reform, we must pay attention to the protection and regulation of seeds to ensure that poor peasants have seeds to sow when the time comes for sowing. Agricultural and forestry workers should go to the countryside to study in practice, combine with the experience of the masses, and promote improved varieties and improve farming methods bit by bit. Oppose the past subjective style of being high above, detached from the masses, and forced promotion.\n 丁. Enable the masses to seize the time to transport manure, plow the spring land, dig the edges and build embankments, and repair canals.\n 戊. In order to complete this year's special crop planting plan (issued to various administrative offices), the suitable planting areas should be immediately determined, seeds prepared and regulated, and technical personnel trained. In addition to the sugar beet production training class which has already been opened, other flue-cured tobacco, indigo dye, etc., must be prepared. Tobacco leaf planting and flue-cured tobacco production are the responsibility of the Agricultural College of Peking University and the Linqing Farm, and dye production is the responsibility of the industrial departments, in order to assist the masses in carrying out production. When planting indigo, it is necessary to simultaneously educate the masses on making indigo and promote indigenous indigo dyeing workshops.\n 己. Mountain afforestation, prohibition of mountain access for forest protection, and plain area tree planting, etc., all the work of demarcating forbidden mountains, collecting tree seeds, organizing sowing, and preparing tree seedlings, etc., it is hoped that it will be completed by the agricultural and forestry bureaus and farms of governments at all levels before the Qingming Festival, according to the letter from the Cooperation Department of the Border Region Government.\n 庚. Prevent insect pests. Each agricultural and forestry bureau and farm should collect effective mass insect control experience, study indigenous pesticides, and exchange and promote them. And the use methods of imported insecticides should be tested.\n 辛. The planned and necessary flood control, water conservancy construction, and plain area well-digging for drought prevention work should be implemented in a planned manner, seizing the time. Those directly responsible by the Border Region Government will be notified separately.\n 壬. Areas severely affected by last year's disaster must immediately provide relief for the spring famine. The basic method is to organize the masses to engage in production for self-relief, and implement work-for-relief with a certain amount of relief grain (separate instructions will be issued).\n 癸. Loans that have not yet been issued in various places must be quickly loaned to poor peasants to prepare for spring planting. In the full-scale land reform in the region, in order to ensure the progress and completion of these preparations, governments at all levels must combine land reform and designate specific personnel to be responsible for doing it. Otherwise, there will be irreparable losses to the interests of the masses and support for the war when the sowing season arrives. If land redistribution has not been completed and the sowing season has arrived, it is even more important to be good at combining, without missing the sowing. Whether the land has been distributed or not, it should not be left barren.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th -- Soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, braving wind, snow, and severe cold, have launched a mass \"assault warfare\" training upsurge. Based on the development and needs of the future war situation, they first conducted intensive training for cadres in various regiments, meticulously studied the experience of past assault battles, and improved the tactical thinking and combat actions of middle and lower-level commanders in assault warfare. Then, with the cadres taking the lead, they launched a widespread training movement. Under the educational method of \"officers teaching soldiers\" and \"soldiers teaching officers,\" the creativity of the soldiers was greatly developed, and the commanding ability of the cadres was improved. For example, in a certain regiment's second battalion's exercise, after the assault company received the task of capturing a bunker complex, the company commander did not deeply understand how to capture it and reduce casualties, and then issued an order. After the soldiers studied it, they found that the order had many shortcomings and developed another method. After the company commander adopted this method, the battle was won completely. During a certain battalion's exercise, the enemy's situation was first drafted, and the squads and platoons studied it on the sand table. The soldiers put forward the commander's position, fire organization, attack actions, etc., which helped the commander to organize the battle more comprehensively.\n\nIn order to promote the training upsurge, more than two-thirds of the cadres of some regimental headquarters went deep into the companies. Military cadres solved tactical problems of the companies, political cadres organized mutual assistance, cultivated typical examples, and understood and consolidated the training mood; supply and health cadres respectively helped to improve the food and company hygiene. They lived with the soldiers in the squads, so they understood the situation very specifically, and solved the problems very practically, greatly promoting the training movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 适应战争形势需要　华东某部练攻坚战\n\n1948-02-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　适应战争形势需要\n  　华东某部练攻坚战\n    【新华社华东二十日电】解放军某部健儿冒风雪严寒掀起群众性“攻坚战”练兵热潮。他们根据今后战争形势的发展和需要，首先在各团集训干部，缜密的研究了以往攻坚战斗的经验，提高中下级指挥员攻坚战术的思想和战斗动作，然后在干部带头下，展开了普遍的练兵运动。在“官教兵”、“兵教官”的教育方法下，大大发扬了战士的创造性，并提高了干部的指挥能力。如某团二营演习中，突击连接受攻下地堡群的任务后，对如何夺取和减少伤亡，连指挥员并未深刻理解，就下了命令，战士研究后，发现命令有许多缺点，并研究出另一个办法，连指挥员采用这个办法后，战斗即获得全胜。某营演习时，先拟就敌情，由班、排于沙盘研究，由战士提出指挥员的位置及火力组织、攻击动作等，帮助了指挥员更全面的组织战斗。\n    为推动练兵热潮，某些团三分之二以上的团部干部都深入连队，军事干部解决连队战术问题，政工干部组织互助，培养典型，了解和巩固练兵情绪；供给、卫生干部分别帮助改善伙食和连队卫生工作。他们和班里战士一道生活，因此了解情况很具体，解决问题就很切实，大大推进了练兵运动。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch: Workers in the Jixi Coal Mine area of ​​Mudanjiang Province are caught up in the wave of workforce reorganization and production. Since the mine held a conference for cadres involved in the reorganization at the end of last month, all employees have enthusiastically launched a campaign to render meritorious service, increasing production to support the front lines. The conference put forward the production task for 1948: to produce 2.1 million to 2.3 million tons of coal. In order to solve the problem of winter fuel for the city, it was decided to increase the daily output from 160 train cars to 200 train cars (a total of 6,000 tons). The mine's output has been increasing month by month in the past year, with October's output nearly doubling that of July last year. Thanks to the enthusiasm of the workers, the Mashan pit achieved a brilliant record of 280 tons per day. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the daily output of this pit never exceeded 100 tons. For example, Huang Zhengqing, a new worker at the Hengshan mine, used to produce one cart of coal per day, but after being instructed by veteran workers, he can now produce three or four carts a day. During the puppet Manchukuo period, workers often used \"running empty carts\" to fool the Japanese devils, but now no worker is willing to push an empty cart. The average output of a worker in the mine has reached 4.5 tons per day. The promoted worker cadres work day and night voluntarily. In order to reduce costs, they themselves take on many miscellaneous tasks inside and outside the pit to reduce the number of odd job workers. They also actively save materials and overcome difficulties. Workers throughout the mine voluntarily contributed more than 200 tools. However, some leading cadres in the mine have not thoroughly embraced the mass line in their thinking. They are concerned that the newly promoted worker cadres are not capable enough and dare not boldly let go and rely on the workers in everything. Some also regard the lack of technical skills of the workers as insurmountable difficulties. On the other hand, there is a lack of class education and concrete assistance for the newly promoted worker cadres, which affects the further increase in production. At this cadre reorganization conference, the above-mentioned shortcomings were reviewed, and a rectification movement will be launched to give full play to the working class's high spirit of serving the people and to ensure the successful completion of the production tasks for 1948.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鸡西煤矿经过整编队伍　生产量提高一倍\n\n1948-02-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鸡西煤矿经过整编队伍\n  　生产量提高一倍\n    【新华社东北电】牡丹江省鸡西煤矿区工人卷入整编队伍和生产热潮中。该矿上月底召开全矿区整编干部大会后，全体职工热烈展开立功运动，提高生产支前。大会提出了四八年生产任务，出煤二百一十万吨至二百三十万吨。并为解决冬季城市燃料，决定由每日运出一百六十车皮增至二百车皮（合计六千吨）。该矿一年来产量逐月增加，去年十月较七月几提高一倍。该矿麻山坑由于工友们发挥了积极性，创造了每日二百八十吨的光辉成绩。伪满时该坑每日出产从未超过一百吨。又如恒山矿新工友黄正清原每天出一车煤，经老工友指教后，现在一天能出三四车。伪满时工人常以“跑空车”敷衍日本鬼子，现在工友们谁也不愿推空车了。该矿一个工人一天平均产量已达四吨半。提拔的工人干部不分日夜，自动工作，为了降低成本，他们自己担负起坑内外许多杂务，来减少杂工。并积极节省材料克服困难，全矿工友自动献出工具二百余件。但在矿山部分领导干部的思想上还没有彻底走群众路线，他们耽心大批新起工人干部能力不够，不敢大胆放手，一切依靠工人，也有的将工人缺乏技术看成是不可克服的困难。另方面对新提拔的工人干部又缺乏阶级教育和具体帮助，影响生产的更加提高。此次整编干部大会上，检讨了上述缺点，将展开整顿队伍运动，以发挥工人阶级高度的为人民服务精神。保证四八年的生产任务的胜利完成。"

The resolution also criticized the Truman administration's foreign policy and urged the rebuilding of friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Simultaneously with the conference, a group of prominent American educators and pastors sent a letter to House Rules Committee Chairman Allen, stating that more than 100 national agricultural, labor, church, and educational groups oppose universal military training.\n　　The conference organizers announced that an anti-military training demonstration march will soon be held in Washington, and many youth groups are uniting forces to carry out nationwide actions to oppose military training.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 21st: Medical workers of a certain unit of the Central China Field Army have overcome various difficulties, including the severe blockade by the Chiang bandits and frequent \"sweeping up\" operations, as well as the lack of medical equipment over the past year, creating various methods to treat wounded soldiers, achieving excellent results: (1) Successful experimentation with blood transfusion devices. Last summer, when medicine and equipment were extremely scarce, wounded soldiers with excessive blood loss often lacked injections of physiological saline. They wanted to perform blood transfusions but lacked the necessary equipment. Utilizing available materials, medical personnel created a scientific blood transfusion device through five experiments, enabling large-scale blood transfusions. Each medical team now has a blood transfusion device. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of blood transfused in the past six months has exceeded 10,000 cc, with each severely wounded soldier receiving an average of 200 to 300 cc of fresh blood, saving many critically ill soldiers. (2) Invention of the Yang's Splint. Comrade Yang Zhong, Minister of Health, carefully researched and created the Yang's Splint, which has a hole in the middle, the size of the bone, that can be opened and closed. During amputation surgery, the splint is slipped over the cut muscle to replace the surgical towel or gauze, avoiding the phenomenon of fibers from the gauze surgical towel entering the periosteum or muscle, causing inflammation and suppuration, while also increasing the speed of surgery by a quarter of the time. (3) Creation of fracture beds. Comrade Shi Zhiyang, a section chief, created a fracture bed, which allows fracture patients to be changed without turning, saving change time and minimizing post-operative deformities. (4) Using cellophane (the transparent paper used to wrap cigarette boxes) for drainage is suitable for new tissues, more economical than rubber strip drainage, and more scientific than gauze strip drainage. (5) Widespread use of protective covers to reduce external pressure on wounds and promote rapid growth of new tissues. (6) Dry dressing (dry gauze) therapy, with strict disinfection, places dry dressing on the wound to allow it to heal naturally, abandoning the old, unscientific, and uneconomical theory of applying oil-based preparations. (7) Adhesive bandage. When the wound is clean and has little secretion, adhesive bandages are used to pull it together, achieving significant results in shortening the healing period. (8) Improved first aid work. Companies emphasize the mass line in battlefield first aid, organizing health soldiers and regularly teaching them battlefield first aid and hygiene knowledge. Seventy-five percent of the wounded on the battlefield are given first aid by health soldiers. After scientific division of labor at the transfer station, an estimated 130 or more wounded soldiers can be processed every hour. Each operating table can perform more than 30 major surgeries within 24 hours, so most wounded soldiers can have surgery completed before inflammation occurs. One wounded soldier had his stomach and intestines broken, and another wounded soldier had three holes in his intestines.

    "content": "In the Kremlin\n    By Guofu Bake, translated by Shao Furen\n\n    During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, Sidor Artemyevich Guofu Bake commanded a large-scale Ukrainian guerrilla group, penetrating deep behind enemy lines, sweeping the German rear guard, destroying railways and bridges, overturning military trains, and burning enemy warehouses and oil plants to coordinate with the main force. He was awarded the rank of Major General for his outstanding achievements and twice awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for his military exploits, and was respected by the people everywhere, known to women and children. His book \"From Putil to the Carpathians\" was a sensation in the Soviet Union. --Translator.\n\n    During those most tense days, one day--it was in the second half of August--I received a radio telegram summoning me to Moscow to attend a conference of guerrilla commanders.\n\n    It is obvious what kind of mood I was in when I said goodbye to my comrades around the carriage. I was eager to take the carriage to the airfield of the Orel guerrilla team, and then fly to Moscow by plane.\n\n    I don't know why, but everyone was convinced that I would be received by Stalin in Moscow, so the people naturally entrusted me to convey their warm guerrilla greetings to the leader; not simply to convey a common greeting on behalf of everyone--they said, of course, Sidor Artemyevich, don't forget--but to convey greetings specifically on behalf of us, that is, individually representing each member. Scouts, demolitionists, mortar men, artillerymen, female medical staff, young messengers, etc., also asked me to convey their special greetings on their behalf. My coat pockets were stuffed with letters, which were to be mailed when I arrived in Moscow.\n\n    …………………………………………\n\n    Shortly after arriving--it was August 31st--we received a phone call warning us not to leave our rooms and run around; we would be received by Comrade Stalin in the Kremlin. Although this was not unexpected--I expected this might happen while I was still on the plane--on the way to the Kremlin, I only thought about one thing: in a moment I would walk into Stalin's office, meet him, and he would talk to me. What good luck!\n\n    Before entering Stalin's office, we passed through several rooms. I thought, \"I'm about to see him.\" Stalin was always in front of my eyes, just like I saw him in the photos. When the door of his office opened, I saw Comrade Stalin exactly like that. It was as if we had met many times and were very familiar with him! Stalin was standing in the middle of the room, still wearing the same clothes that people were familiar with in the photos. Beside Stalin was Voroshilov, wearing a marshal's uniform.\n\n    \"Look, this is him, Guofu Bake!\" Comrade Voroshilov said.\n\n    Stalin smiled. He shook my hand, greeted everyone, and asked us to sit down. The person next to me at the table turned out to be Molotov. I didn't see Vyacheslav Mikhailovich (Molotov's name--translator) until I sat down next to him.\n\n    Comrade Stalin sat at the table, diagonally opposite me. I thought this reception must be very short--this is a very tense moment! However, Joseph Vissarionovich (Stalin's name--translator) calmly began the work conversation. He asked about our families and whether we were still in contact with them. Sometimes he needed to interrupt the conversation to go to the phone. When he returned to the table, Comrade Stalin repeated the question. He talked to this person for a while, and then to another. When it was my turn to talk, I felt as if Joseph Vissarionovich slowly took my hand and pulled it towards him. Perhaps everyone had this feeling. Then everyone regained their senses and calmed down. Obviously, Stalin noticed this and started talking about the guerrillas. He first asked me how our contact with the people was, and how the people felt about the guerrillas. I stood up, wanting to report, but Comrade Stalin said there was no need to report, and asked me to sit down and answer the questions he raised.\n\n    Comrade Stalin asked me many questions. When answering the first question, I began to describe how we maintained contact with the people, how the people helped us, etc. Joseph Vissarionovich immediately made us understand that this was the most important point, and he believed that this point was of great significance. He nodded frequently, as if saying, \"Yes, yes, it is good to be closely connected with the people.\"\n\n    On some issues, Comrade Stalin focused our attention, while other issues were only mentioned in passing. Among them, when talking about the issue of contact with the local people, Stalin asked me whether the guerrilla team needed political commissars. But when I said that it was difficult for only one commander to complete all the political work, because this work had to be done not only in the troops, but also in all the villages and towns we passed, Comrade Stalin said, \"Understood,\" and the conversation about the political commissar issue ended like this. Stalin never repeated this question.\n\n    When talking about how our equipment was, how our clothing was, and how our weapons and munitions were replenished, I replied:\n\n    \"There is only one source, Comrade Stalin! It all depends on the enemy, on the spoils of war.\"\n\n    \"Very good,\" Stalin said, \"Now we will supply you with our own weapons.\"\n\n    While answering Joseph Vissarionovich's questions, I thought that he knew everything I was saying. The reason why he asked me was just to lead me to a certain important idea, to help me clarify something myself. Only later did I realize that he was unknowingly leading me to these conclusions from beginning to end, but when I understood, I was shocked: how simple and clear!\n\n    After I answered a series of questions, Comrade Stalin asked: Why can our guerrilla team become a mobile guerrilla team? I described some of the advantages of mobile tactics, which we proved in the combat experience in the Sumy area.\n\n    After listening to me, Stalin asked an unexpected question: If everything is as you said, if mobile warfare is advantageous, then can't we advance to the right bank of the Dnieper River?\n\n    This was serious, and I couldn't answer immediately.\n\n    \"Think about it,\" Stalin said.\n\n    We had never talked about the issue of attacking the West Bank region of Ukraine, and we didn't dare to dream about it. Comrade Stalin called our guerrilla team a mobile guerrilla team, which was completely correct. The essence of our tactics lies here--Stalin summarized it with the most accurate word. But our mobile warfare is from one county to another, and this time we have to pass through several states and cross the Desna River and the Dnieper River. The scale is completely different.\n\n    \"What is this!\" I thought. \"Isn't the scale of the battles we planned in the Shinarie Forest and Staraguda area much larger than what we could do when we first came out of the Spasent Forest? Didn't the summer advance on Putil's battle leave the winter advance from Khvosevka far behind? The scale of our operations is constantly expanding. At first, we didn't leave the county boundary, but later we advanced to all parts of the northern Sumy Oblast, and now we have left the Sumy Oblast boundary. In this way, there is nothing impossible in Comrade Stalin's proposal. He is just drawing conclusions from our experience, and he is sending us to places that we cannot do ourselves, and it is obvious that people are most needed there at this moment. In fact, why are we always circling around the Sumy area, turning around the old nest? Isn't the whole advantage of our mobile tactics that we always have the initiative and can strike the enemy's most painful points at any time?\"\n\n    These thoughts inspired me to answer the questions raised by Comrade Stalin.\n\n    Stalin was talking to others at this time, glanced at me, probably seeing from my expression that I was already able to answer and was waiting for him to ask me. When he suddenly turned around to speak to me, I was surprised, as if he was always paying attention to me and had guessed my thoughts, and said:\n\n    \"Please tell me, I'm listening, Comrade Guofu Bake.\"\n\n    \"I think, Comrade Stalin,\" I said, \"we can advance to the right bank of the Dnieper River.\"\n\n    \"What do you need for this?\" Stalin asked.\n\n    I replied that what we needed most urgently were artillery, automatic rifles, and anti-tank guns.\n\n    \"We have everything,\" Stalin said, and ordered me to immediately write a request for everything needed for the advance to the West Bank.\n\n    I wrote the request and calculated the number of flights needed to transport all the materials I requested by air, and I was shocked--I found that the number was too large. \"Can I request so much immediately?\" I thought about it and rewrote the request, greatly reducing the number. Even so, I was afraid that when I handed the request to Comrade Stalin, he would say: \"Ah, you are extravagant, Comrade Guofu Bake!\"\n\n    The result was not like this. Stalin looked at the list I presented and asked:\n\n    \"Can these guarantee you?\"\n\n    When I said that I didn't intend to request too many things, Stalin returned the request to me and ordered me to rewrite it.\n\n    \"We can issue everything you need,\" he said.\n\n    When redoing the request, I thought that it would be best to give the soldiers some boots, but I thought it was too much, so I didn't write boots, but requested leather shoes. Stalin read the new request and immediately crossed out the leather shoes. Alas, I still wanted to get boots! But just as I was about to scold myself, Stalin's hand had already written \"boots\" on top of the crossed-out \"leather shoes\".\n\n    When Stalin talked to us, it was as if he had a lot of time, without urging us at all, allowing us to use our thinking quietly, and all problems were solved on the spot immediately, without delaying for a minute.\n\n    On the eve of parting, Stalin gave us the advice:\n\n    \"Comrades, the most important thing is to maintain close contact with the people,\" he smiled, waved his hand, and pointed to the people sitting at the table with us and said: \"For the time being, you are our second battlefield.\"\n\n    On the way back, when crossing the front line by Douglas plane to the Brian Forest, I was convinced that the period of fundamental change in the course of the war was not far away. The conversation with Comrade Stalin and the order to attack that I read before taking off in Moscow left no doubt about this matter...

    "content": "From Workers and Peasants Back to Workers and Peasants\n  　Reflections from the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting\n  　Comrade Yang Zhaohai's Reflection\n    Becoming an Official and Enjoying Comfort, Forgetting the Peasants\n    (Born to a poor peasant/hired hand family, 27 years old, joined the Party in June 1943, started working in July, currently district chief of Anyang First District.)\n    I am from Anyang First District. My childhood was hard; I lived in poverty. When I was seventeen, my father died, and there was little to eat at home. Seeing the landlord Yang Huaiwu in my village as the captain, riding a white horse and carrying a box cannon, I was very envious. When I was twenty-four, I lived as a hired hand in Xin'an, and the landlord's child carried a \"Type 38\" rifle and a box cannon, looking very impressive. I thought to myself, one day I, a poor hired hand, could also strut around with a box cannon.\n    In 1942, hired hands got a raise in wages. In 1943, I had 22 mu of land, so I stopped being a hired hand and started as a militiaman. I was an activist during the struggle meetings, but I always thought it would be more impressive to be a district cadre leading a team with a box cannon. In July, I went to the Public Security Bureau and, with a gun on my hip, became impressive. Every time I went home, the neighbors would say that my brother and I were the \"Stone Dragon and Stone Tiger brothers.\" I often thought of going home and showing off. After becoming a cadre, carrying a gun, and knowing a few words, I thought there was something to be gained from the revolution. At this time, seeing others confiscating a lot of things, I thought that being honest was a disadvantage, and I developed the idea of equipping myself. I felt that if I didn't grab something, it wouldn't be worth it. I grabbed a watch and was criticized, and I thought, \"Why is it that everyone else grabs a lot, but you only see me?\" I didn't realize that I shouldn't have been learning from others' mistakes. In the Fourth District, seeing that others were better dressed than me, I felt rustic, so I made clothes out of the cheap foreign cloth I bought. In Zhaizhuang, I confiscated a lot of things and grabbed another watch. At this time, I started to become \"Westernized.\" Others had carts, so I also grabbed a cart. Once I had a cart, I would even ride it to peasants' homes to eat. One time, on the street, some peasants called out to me, \"Old Yang, Old Yang!\" wanting to talk to me. I rode past on my cart, pretending not to hear. I also wanted to live in a more \"Westernized\" house. I put blankets and sheets on the bed, and when meetings were held, others didn't dare to sit on it. I thought it was pretty good. After equipping myself, I wanted to equip my family and make my home more impressive. I was afraid people would laugh at me if I looked as shabby as before. I sent desks, chairs, and a mirror home. After having desks, chairs, and a house, I thought the walls were too dark and wanted to move to a place on flat ground since I lived on the edge of the village. The year before last, in October, when I was studying in Yuzhong, some classmates planned to pass by my house. I felt that my home was not impressive enough and would be embarrassing, so I quickly wrote home, asking them to borrow a nice house and decorate it before my classmates arrived. When I was engaged in production at the Lianzhong, I was pushing cabbage and sweating profusely to Nanguan (Linxian). I ran into some cadres from my village. My face turned red, and I felt very embarrassed, afraid that others would say I had made a mistake and how would I face them when I went home? I quickly stopped the cart at Nanguan and told the cadres that I was producing, and only then did I feel relieved. I considered labor not to be honorable. Because I was the district chief, I only wanted to learn from the former \"captain.\" Before coming back to study this time, I even wanted to make myself a military uniform, a leather coat, and buy a harmonica (I already bought it) so that I could go to my wife's family during the New Year and let them know that I was presentable. At the same time, I often wanted to put on airs, only wanting to hold big meetings so that the masses would all know that I was the district chief. I took a messenger with me when I went to the countryside, but I didn't dare to show off too much, afraid that people would figure out my background and know that I was a hired hand. I thought that as long as others were afraid of me, everything would be easy to handle. I started by scolding the cooks and messengers, and then I scolded the district and village cadres, making them look fierce so that they wouldn't be afraid of not completing anything they were assigned to do.\n    In my work, I did not have a clear class viewpoint. I held the idea of \"eating from someone, protecting someone\" like a hired hand. In order to show that I was carrying out orders, resolutely completing tasks, and showing myself off, I harmed the masses. After this reflection, I realized that I had forgotten my roots after turning over and had taken the old road. I started by hating the landlords for the sake of the masses, but after becoming a cadre and an official, I forgot my poor brothers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 来自工农回到工农　太行五地委整党会的反省　杨兆海同志反省  作官享福忘了农民\n\n1948-02-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　来自工农回到工农\n  　太行五地委整党会的反省\n  　杨兆海同志反省\n    作官享福忘了农民\n    （贫雇出身，现年二十七岁，四三年六月入党，七月参加工作，现任安阳一区区长。）\n    我是安阳一区人，小时光景不好，过的穷天气。十七岁那年，俺爹死了，家里没啥吃。看到俺村地主杨怀吾当队长，骑着白马，带着盒子枪，自己很眼气。二十四岁那年在新安住觅汉，主家孩子背着“三八式”，带着盒子枪，看得非常排场；想想自己是个穷觅汉，那天也能带着盒子枪抖起来。\n    四二年觅汉增资，四三年有了廿二亩地，就不住觅汉了，开始当民兵。斗争时是积极分子，但想总不如当个区干队带上盒子威风。七月到了公安局，带上手枪，就威风起来了。每次回家邻家都说我和俺哥是石龙石虎二弟兄，这样常想回家抖一抖威风。当了干部，带上了枪，又识几个字，想到革命还是有个赚头。这时见到别人抓的东西多，自己想到老实吃亏，就产生了装备思想，觉得不抓一把不够本，抓了一个表受了批评，心想别人抓的多为什么光看见我了？没有认识自己不该学习别人的错误。在四区见别人比自己穿的好，觉得土气，就把贱买的洋布做衣服。在翟庄，大抓东西，又抓一个手表。这时开始“洋”起来了。别人有车子，我也抓了个车子，有了车子，到老百姓家吃饭也骑上车子去。有一回在街上老百姓喊我：“老杨老杨”！想给我谈话。我骑着车子，装个没听见，就过去了。住的房子也老想洋气点，在床上铺的毯子、单子，开会时别人不敢往上坐，我觉得还不错。装备了自己就想装备家，把家闹的排场点，当了干部还象从前一样破烂，怕人家笑话。把桌椅镜子，送到家里，有了桌椅房子，又嫌墙黑了，又住在村边，就想搬到平地上住。前年十月，我在豫中学习，有几个同学准备路过我家，心觉家里不排场，见不得人，赶快往家写信，让他们借个好房子，摆设一下，等同学们路过。在联中搞生产，推着白菜满头流汗到南关（林县），碰到俺村几个干部，自己一脸红，觉得很丢人，怕别人说我是犯了错误，以后回家怎样见人？赶快把车子停在南关，又找见干部告诉他们说是生产的，这才放了心，我把劳动看成不是光荣的。因为自己当了区长，就光想学习过去的“队长”。这次回来学习前，还想做一身军装，作个皮大衣，买个口琴（已经买了），过年时和老婆一块到丈人家去，叫他们也知道我象个样。同时自己又常想摆个架子，光想开大会，叫群众都认识我是区长。下乡带上通讯员，可是又不敢装，怕人家摸我的底，知道我是个觅汉，就觉得只要别人怕我，啥事也好办。开始先训火夫、通讯员，后来就训区村干部，叫他们看着厉害，干啥事也不怕完不成。\n    我在工作中没有明确阶级观点，是抱着“吃谁保谁”当觅汉的思想，为了表示执行命令，坚决完成任务，显示自己，害了群众。这回我反省后，认识了翻身忘本，走了一条老道路，开始仇恨地主为群众，后来当了干部做了官，忘了自己穷弟兄。"

    "content": "Eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, Smash All Ruling Institutions of the Chiang Family Dynasty!\n    Chen Boda\n    Mao Zedong's recent epoch-making revolutionary proclamation pointed out: \"The People's Liberation Army issued a declaration in October 1947, which stated: 'Unite the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and all oppressed classes, all people's organizations, all democratic parties, all minority nationalities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic elements to form a national united front, overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, and establish a democratic coalition government.' This is the most fundamental political program of the People's Liberation Army and also of the Chinese Communist Party.\" This is also the democratic republic of the joint democratic dictatorship of all revolutionary classes and the joint dictatorship of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people, as described in Mao Zedong's \"On New Democracy.\" The fundamental problem of revolution is the problem of political power. A democratic regime jointly formed by all revolutionary classes must replace the fascist dictatorial regime of the big landlords and big comprador. The new democratic revolution of the Chinese people must eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and, at the same time, eliminate the entire foundation of the fascist dynasty of Chiang Kai-shek, the great feudal slave owner and comprador of big foreign firms. As Mao Zedong analyzed, the economic foundation of this counter-revolutionary dynasty is the feudal and semi-feudal land system and the feudal comprador's bureaucratic monopoly capital system. And its political foundation is the entire ruling apparatus of the warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents.\n    Because Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty is under constant revolutionary attacks by the Chinese people and is extremely isolated in society, its set of blood-sucking institutions of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, inherited from the Manchu Dynasty and the Northern Warlords, has been continuously expanded to an extremely alarming scale, developing in direct proportion to the wealth of the Four Big Families. The number of personnel in Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary military institutions is as high as more than four million, along with other forms of armed forces, either overt or covert, such as police, military police, and secret agents. Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary bureaucratic apparatus, as far as the Chiang family's \"Central\" small court is concerned, was reported by a Xi'an newspaper in April 1946 as follows: \"The number of 'Central' civil servants was no more than 10,000 at the end of the Qing Dynasty, no more than 20,000 in the early years of the Republic of China, 80,000 before the War of Resistance, and reached 270,000 in January of the 35th year. There were 130,000 public servants. In recent months, many new institutions have been added, such as the Northwest and Wuhan headquarters, various pacification commissions, and materials bureaus. As of April 10, the number of central civil servants will reach 300,000, public servants 150,000, and officials supporting servants 500,000, which is equivalent to supporting 2 million soldiers.\" As far as the local governments of the Chiang family court are concerned, a Peiping newspaper reported in October 1947: \"The organization and staffing of local governments are indeed much larger than they were eight years ago. For example, before the autumn of the 28th year, a provincial government had four departments: Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, and two offices: Secretariat and Security, with a total of four or five hundred staff members. But now, in addition to the above four departments and two offices, the provincial government also has police, accounting, land and grain, social affairs, agriculture and forestry, health, cooperation, news, personnel, and other offices, as well as land administration, water conservancy, and assessment bureaus. Together with more than ten agencies operating outside the provincial government, there are more than thirty units in total, with a staff of as many as three to four thousand people. Another example is the county government of a first-class county, which had only three sections and one office before the autumn of the 28th year, with a staff of twenty or so people. Now, it has seven sections and eight offices, with the staff increased to more than two hundred people. As for the organizations below the county level, since the implementation of the new county system, there are township offices below the district offices, each with one head and deputy head, and more than ten clerks and secretaries. Below the township level, there are bao offices, each with one head and deputy head, and several clerks. For example, in a certain province in Southeast China, about ten thousand county government employees, more than twenty thousand district chiefs, instructors, township heads, deputy heads, clerks, and secretaries, and more than ten thousand bao heads and clerks were added in half a year, which is truly a grand sight.\" The figures listed here do not include the jia heads. According to some newspapers in 1946, the number of officials in the Chiang government had increased by 70% compared to 1937. But according to various materials, the actual increase was much greater than this estimate. Generally speaking, the Chiang family's bureaucratic apparatus, from the puppet \"Central\" to the baojia, includes at least one thousand several hundred thousand bureaucrats, which is a minimum figure. As for Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary secret agent apparatus, this is Chiang Kai-shek's most heinous new creation in all feudal comprador dynasties in China, a special symbol of Chiang Kai-shek's feudal comprador fascism, and includes at least hundreds of thousands of people. There are also many Kuomintang members and Three People's Principles Youth League members who, although not professional secret agents, are also coerced into doing some secret agent work. Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty relies on such an extraordinarily large ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, unique in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, and connects with all kinds of city foxes, village rats, and local tyrants and evil gentry in order to fight the people, plunder the people, protect the wealth of the Four Big Families, and suffocate the Chinese people. At the same time, it gradually and massively concentrates the people's hatred in order to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty. Of course, within all of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary ruling institutions, in addition to those warlords, reactionary politicians, corrupt officials, and die-hard secret agents, many people are forced to serve the Four Big Families. The soldiers in Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary army are all poor people who have been kidnapped. Many people in the bureaucratic institutions at all levels are only trying to make a living and do not necessarily intend to do bad things. There are also many who are genuinely kind-hearted and have not yet done anything bad. Due to the brutal oppression and exploitation by the Four Big Families, and as Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty is heading towards a major collapse politically, economically, and militarily, not only are the soldiers of the Chiang army suffering from greater hunger and cold, but many middle and lower-level officials and their families in the Chiang family government and army are also trapped in hunger and cold, seeking their own way out and way of life. Therefore, within all of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary institutions, a major rebellion against the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty is brewing. Completely smashing Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, and having the people and their representatives directly control all state ruling power, is to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's anti-national and anti-people counter-revolutionary political system. This will not only eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, but also ensure that after Chiang Kai-shek falls, there will never be anyone who can succeed him. During the Xinhai Revolution, although the Manchu Qing court fell, Yuan Shikai used the warlord and bureaucratic ruling apparatus of the Manchu Qing court to stage a counter-revolution. During the Great Revolution, although the Northern Warlords failed, Chiang Kai-shek used the ruling apparatus of the Northern Warlords to stage a counter-revolution. This is a great lesson of the revolution. Therefore, if we do not fundamentally smash Chiang Kai-shek's entire counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, and if we do not establish the new democratic political power of the Chinese people throughout the country, our revolution can never stop and can never achieve final victory. And eliminating the feudal and semi-feudal land system and the feudal comprador's bureaucratic monopoly capital system is the economic foundation for smashing Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus.\n    The failure of the Political Consultative Conference further illustrates that as long as Chiang Kai-shek's set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents exists, the so-called \"peace\" and \"democracy\" resolutions can only be words written on white paper. And imperialist aggression is inevitably linked to that counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus. That set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus relies on imperialist aid to exist, and at the same time, imperialist aggression expands into China through that set of counter-revolutionary ruling apparatus. The upper-level ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents, formed to suit the economic foundation of big landlords and big compradors, does not necessarily have to be represented by a fixed person. It can be represented by Empress Dowager Cixi, by Yuan Shikai, by Duan Qirui, or by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu, or by Chiang Kai-shek. In short, any rogue scoundrel, turtle bastard, as long as there is a suitable opportunity, can be promoted by imperialists and Chinese reactionaries, either called \"emperor,\" or called \"president,\" or called \"president\" yesterday, and \"emperor\" today, or called \"chairman of the National Government\" today, and \"president\" tomorrow. The problem is the system. If that kind of feudal and semi-feudal colonial or semi-colonial economic system exists, there will be people suitable for that system. But which individual comes out is accidental. This explains why a murderous rogue and a cunning and insidious exchange broker like Chiang Kai-shek could become a great thief of a poor country and a great traitor, oppressing the Chinese people for as long as twenty years. At the same time, that system is not necessarily represented by a fixed person, and it is not necessarily represented by one person. As long as that system continues to exist, if the concentrated Yuan Shikai dies, it can be represented by decentralized Yuan Shikais. Now, when Chiang Kai-shek is at his end, American imperialism and Chinese feudal slave owners and big foreign firm compradors are also looking for gaps and plotting, attempting to preserve Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of warlord, bureaucratic, and secret agent ruling apparatus, and preparing to temporarily let Chiang Kai-shek step down as a last resort, using several decentralized Chiang Kai-sheks to replace the concentrated Chiang Kai-shek, in order to deceive the public and缓和the revolutionary offensive of the Chinese people, and then see how things go, and call the concentrated Chiang Kai-shek to re-enthronement and restoration tomorrow. Chiang Kai-shek has played the trick of so-called \"stepping down\" twice, once in August 1927 and the second time after the September 18th Incident. Now he is trying to play it a third time. But the Chinese people have a hundred years of experience, especially the experience of the First Great Revolution, the Ten Years of Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the armistice agreement and the Political Consultative Conference after Japan's surrender. All these experiences have been concentrated in Mao Zedong's extremely firm theories and policies. The Chinese people will no longer be fooled. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people must carry the revolution through to the end.\n    Chiang Kai-shek's political concept is an enlarged and fascistized political concept of Yuan Shikai. This political concept is: relying on the anti-people's unlimited dictatorial power of imperialism and armed counter-revolution. This political concept reflects China's feudal and semi-feudal colonial or semi-colonial economic system, and also reflects the warlord, bureaucratic, and secret agent political system on this economic system. To eliminate this counter-revolutionary political concept, we must first eliminate this reactionary economic system and counter-revolutionary political system. And the fundamental driving force for eliminating this reactionary and counter-revolutionary economic system and political system is armed revolution based on peasant land reform. This is the great Mao Zedong Thought: \"The characteristic and also the advantage of the Chinese revolution is that armed people oppose armed counter-revolution.\" Mao Zedong grasps this great truth every day, awake or asleep. The central force of Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary system is his counter-revolutionary armed forces. Only by extinguishing Chiang Kai-shek's armed counter-revolution can we eliminate the system represented by Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, the main form of the Chinese revolutionary struggle is armed struggle, using the people's armed forces to oppose armed counter-revolution and completely smash the armed counter-revolution. If the goal of completely smashing Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary armed forces is not achieved, it will be impossible to completely smash Chiang Kai-shek's entire set of ruling apparatus of warlords, bureaucrats, and secret agents.\n    Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition Declaration said: \"All those who combine military force with imperialism will fail, and conversely, all those who combine with the people to accelerate the progress of the national revolution will win.\" Facts have proved that Sun Yat-sen's assertion is completely pertinent. The counter-revolutionary army led by Chiang Kai-shek is combined with American imperialism, and the result is that it will fail. The revolutionary army led by Mao Zedong is combined with the people and is an army of the people themselves, and the result is that it will win. Now the task of the Chinese people is to intensify assistance and cooperation with the advancing great People's Liberation Army. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the time has come for the Chinese people to capture the public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, and finally smash Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary dynasty.\n    In the past twenty years, the struggle between the two roads in China—Mao Zedong's road and Chiang Kai-shek's road—the question of who will win and who will lose has been completely determined. The winner is Mao Zedong's road, and the loser is Chiang Kai-shek's road. Mao Zedong's road is China's independence, freedom, and prosperity. Chiang Kai-shek's road is China's demise. These two roads are the two roads of the Chinese people's struggle against the anti-people and the revolution against the counter-revolution for a hundred years, concentrated in the past twenty years between a revolutionary camp headed by Mao Zedong and a counter-revolutionary camp headed by Chiang Kai-shek. The victory of Mao Zedong's road is the complete victory of the Chinese people. This is the complete end of China's colonial or semi-colonial feudal or semi-feudal economic and political system, and this is the complete end of Chiang Kai-shek's political concept. Mao Zedong said that the large-scale offensive of the People's Liberation Army against the Kuomintang-controlled areas is \"the turning point from the development to the elimination of imperialism's rule in China for more than a hundred years,\" which means that the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog in China fostered by worldwide imperialism for twenty years—especially by American imperialism in recent years—will mean that imperialism's enslavement of China will be gone forever.\n    Mao Zedong called out: \"Now is the historical era in which world capitalism and imperialism are heading for extinction, and worldwide socialism and democracy are heading for victory.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: TASS, New York, February 19th: The continuous decline in prices confirms a widespread opinion: The U.S. economy, even if it has not yet entered a stage of recession, is approaching one. On February 18th, wholesale prices overall were slightly lower than on the 17th. Compared to February 3rd, wheat prices fell 51 cents per bushel, corn 38 cents, oats 13 cents, cotton more than $2 per bale, and pigs $2.50 per \"shengdingna\" (note: one shengdingna is equivalent to 100 Chinese catties) each. Farmers in Kansas alone lost $1 million due to falling prices. Figures from major U.S. industries show a decline in production levels. The Federal Reserve Board's latest index confirms some reductions in production in December of last year. Weekly indices published by various non-official agencies indicate that production continued to decrease throughout January and early February. The New York Times' weekly index of business activity showed a decline for the second consecutive week. The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on the evening of February 18th that new orders for both major equipment and consumer goods had decreased significantly. The index of new orders in December fell from 267 in November to 252. The latest statistics show a significant decline in retail trade. The reduction in new orders and retail trade volume, as well as the tightening of credit, has accelerated bankruptcies. 631 companies have gone bankrupt this year, compared to 342 in the same period last year. According to the Commercial Daily, the number of company bankruptcies last week reached its highest peak since January 19, 1943. It is generally believed that even if the Marshall Plan is implemented, foreign markets will play a smaller role in supporting the U.S. economy than they did last year. Bryce N. Harlow, an official representative of the Department of Commerce, wrote in the Commercial Daily, estimating that U.S. exports this year, even with the Marshall Plan, would still decrease by about 10% compared to last year. \"U.S. News,\" a business publication of the U.S. business community, predicts that prices will fall by about 20%, production will decrease by at least 20%, and unemployment will increase accordingly.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Reports from various sources: The people of the United States and Canada express indifference and distrust towards the \"Marshall Plan.\" According to the United Press report, State Department officials revealed that of the 5,000 letters they receive each week inquiring about foreign policy, only 200 are about the \"Marshall Plan,\" accounting for only 4% of all letters. Therefore, the official had to \"reluctantly\" admit that \"society is indifferent.\" The American people's indifference to the Marshall Plan \"is due to the fact that they are more concerned about the sharp drop in prices than about the State Department's 'foreign aid' documents\" (TASS, February 14th). Meanwhile, the Washington dispatch of the London Daily Telegraph stated that the U.S. administrative officials in charge of the \"Marshall Plan\" are becoming increasingly annoyed by the indifference shown by Americans towards the implementation of the \"aid to Europe\" plan. According to the Canadian Financial Post, 80 out of 100 Canadians do not believe that the Marshall Plan can be realized. The Ottawa Journal also stated in its editorial: \"The Marshall Plan\" is gradually weakening, and no one knows what it will eventually become. The newspaper urged that \"no hope\" be placed on the \"plan.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国生产水平降低  经济迫近衰落阶段\n\n1948-02-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国生产水平降低  经济迫近衰落阶段\n    【新华社陕北廿一日电】塔斯社纽约十九日电：物价继续不断的跌落，证实了一个普遍的意见：美国经济即使不是已进入衰落阶段，也是正迫近衰落阶段。二月十八日，批发价格整个说来较十七日稍低。与二月三日相比较，小麦价格每蒲式尔下跌五角一分，玉蜀黍三角八分，燕麦一角三分，棉花每包下跌二元多，猪每生丁纳（按：每生丁纳合我国一百市斤）下跌二元半。仅堪萨斯州一州的农民，即因物价下跌损失一百万美元。美国主要工业的数字，显示生产水平的降落。联邦准备局的最新指数，证实了去年十二月生产有某些削减。各种非官方机关发表的每周指数，说明了一月份全月和二月初生产仍在继续减少中。纽约时报所发表的每周企业活动指数，表示了连续第二周的下降。美商务部二月十八日晚宣布：主要装备和消费品的新定单均有很大减少。十二月份新定单指数由十一月的二六七减少至二五二，最新的统计数字显示零售贸易有显著下跌。新定单和零售贸易数量的减少以及信用的紧缩，加速了破产。今年内已有六三一家公司破产，而去年同一时期内破产公司为三四二家。据商务日报称，公司破产的数目上周已达到一九四三年一月十九日以来的最高峰。一般认为：即使马歇尔计划实现，国外市场在支持美国经济的作用上，亦将较去年为小。商务部官方代表布莱斯德尔在商务日报上著文，估计美国今年的输出，即使有马歇尔计划，仍将较去年减少约百分之十。美国企业界机关报\"美国新闻\"预料价格将下落约百分之二十，生产减少最少百分之二十，同时失业也将随之增加。\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：美、加人民对\"马歇尔计划\"表示冷淡和不信任。据合众社报导：国务院官员透露：该院每周收到五千封询问外交政策的信中，只有二百封是关于\"马歇尔计划\"的，仅占全部信件百分之四。因此该官员不得不\"勉强\"承认说：\"社会上表示冷淡\"。美人民对马歇尔计划冷淡，\"其原因是他们对物价的猛跌比对国务院'援外'的文件关切得多\"（塔斯社十四日电）。同时，伦敦每日电讯报华府消息称：掌管\"马歇尔计划\"的美行政官员，越来越因为美人对实行\"援欧\"计划所表现的冷淡，而日益烦恼\"。另据加拿大财政邮报载称：加国一百人中有八十人不相信马歇尔计划能实现。渥太华日报在其专论中亦称：\"马歇尔计划\"日渐衰萎，谁也不知道它最后会变成什么，该报敦促对该\"计划\"\"不要存任何希望\"。"

The origin of this festival is as follows:\n    After the October Revolution in the Soviet Union in 1917, in order to consolidate the Soviet regime, it was necessary to emerge from the state of war, because continuing to fight Germany at that time was the biggest obstacle to the consolidation of the Soviet regime. Therefore, the Soviet government decided to negotiate with Germany and Austria. On February 10, 1918, the peace talks in Brest were interrupted. Although Lenin and Stalin, representing the Party Central Committee, insisted on signing the treaty, Trotsky, the chairman of the Soviet delegation to the Brest peace talks, betrayed and violated the direct instructions of the Bolshevik Party. He declared that the Soviet Republic refused to sign the treaty under the conditions demanded by Germany; at the same time, he informed the German army that the Soviet Republic would not wage war, and the army would continue to disband. This was exactly what the German bandits hoped for, and the German army took the opportunity to attack, putting the young Soviet Republic in a very dangerous situation. The German invasion also aroused a magnificent revolutionary upsurge in the Soviet Republic. In response to the call issued by the Party and the Soviet government -- \"The socialist motherland is in danger\" -- the working class responded by stepping up the organization of the Red Army. The new revolutionary people's army heroically resisted the German bandits. The German army was met with resolute resistance, and the offensive was stopped by the Red Army. The day of retaliation against the German imperialist army -- February 23 -- became the birthday of the young Red Army and was designated as the Soviet Army Founding Day. From then on, peace was achieved, allowing the Party to win time to organize a stronger Red Army and accumulate strength, so that it could defeat the White bandits and all enemies at home and abroad during the civil war.\n    Thanks to the existence of the powerful Soviet Red Army, and even more thanks to the wise leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Union overcame countless dangers and finally successfully built a socialist country, enabling the people to live an extremely happy and prosperous life, and giving the oppressed people of the world hope for liberation.\n    During World War II, many countries in Eastern Europe were liberated by the Soviet Army, and our Northeast Liberated Area was also liberated by the Soviet Army's strike that defeated Japan and forced it to surrender. The Soviet Army was the decisive force in defeating German and Japanese imperialism, and it is also the decisive force in defending world peace and democracy now.

The statement lists Nazi German diplomatic documents seized by the Soviet army during the war against Germany, proving that British, American, and French imperialism fostered the Hitler gang before the war, resulting in an unprecedented human catastrophe. During the war, they wavered and slacked off in their efforts, using Germany to weaken the Soviet Union on the one hand, and secretly plotting a separate peace with Germany on the other, thus prolonging the war. The statement begins by stating that: \"The purpose of the U.S. State Department in publishing the so-called German-Soviet documents is solely to use fabricated material to slander the Soviet Union, which is a staunch fighter for democracy and anti-aggression, in an attempt to reduce its international prestige.\" The statement also states: \"The Soviet government opposed the publication of the seized German documents before they had been jointly verified by the four powers. The governments of Britain, the United States, and France have now arbitrarily published them, risking the great transgression of falsifying history in order to slander the Soviet Union, which bore the greatest burden in the war against Germany. The three governments must bear full responsibility for the consequences of this unilateral action.\" The entire statement is filled with extremely valuable and irrefutable secret facts, such as the fact that after the outbreak of the war, Britain, the United States, and France not only did not make efforts to fight against Germany, but instead planned to attack the Soviet Union. In addition to the fact that Britain and the United States instigated Finland to attack the Soviet Union, which is already known to the world, the French generals Weygand and de Gaulle even planned to attack the Soviet Union from the Caucasus. After the Soviet Union joined the war, Britain and the United States, without the consent of the Soviet Union, discussed a separate peace with Germany in Lisbon and Switzerland.

The number of prisoners is currently being verified. Our army launched the general offensive against Anshan at 7:25 AM on the 19th. After approximately sixteen hours of fierce fighting, by 24:00 on the 19th, we completely annihilated the defending enemy, the 25th Division of the 52nd Army and a portion of the public security police, without a single one escaping. We recovered Anshan, the famous \"Steel Capital\" of the Far East. The enemy's Provisional 62nd Division of the New 6th Army, besieged in the isolated city of Faku, attempted to break through to the south on the 15th without success. On the afternoon of the 17th at 5:00 PM, they attempted another breakthrough to the northeast. We immediately intercepted and pursued them. After two days and three nights of fierce pursuit and annihilation, we finally captured and annihilated the entire enemy force between Faku and Changtu at 21:00 on the 19th. The city of Faku was then recovered by us. With this, our army has achieved five great victories in the winter offensive, annihilating seven enemy reorganized divisions and liberating the 12th and 13th cities on the periphery of Shenyang. The enemy's 25th Division was completely annihilated northwest of Kuandian in November of the year before last. This is the reorganization and re-annihilation of that division. Furthermore, the enemy's Provisional 62nd Division was formed after our autumn offensive last year by combining the special service regiment of the former Chiang bandit Northeast Headquarters, one regiment of the 169th Division of the New 6th Army, and security regiments, and was fully equipped with American weaponry.\n    [New China News Agency, Northeast, 20th] Recently, a reporter interviewed Cao Jimin, deputy commander of the Chiang bandit Provisional 54th Division, who was recently captured in the Liaoyang campaign, in a certain area on the front lines. He is a native of Fengcheng, Andong, is fifty years old this year, and graduated from the seventh class of the Northeast Jiangwutang Military Academy. After the September 18th Incident, he worked for the \"East Hebei Autonomous Government\" of the traitor Yin Rugeng. After Japan surrendered, he returned to Andong to organize the \"underground army\" for the Kuomintang. When talking about the current living conditions inside the Chiang bandit forces, he said: \"The soldiers haven't been paid for two months, and they can't even get enough sorghum rice to eat. Most of the soldiers in our division are from Andong. When they see that the situation is not good, who is willing to die for nothing? We are now afraid of your army (referring to the People's Liberation Army) just like the Qing soldiers at the end of the Qing Dynasty were afraid of the revolutionaries. Everyone gets a headache when they hear about fighting.\" When the reporter asked for his opinion on the current situation in the Northeast, he said: \"Our side (referring to the Chiang bandit side) is like having third-stage tuberculosis, relying entirely on injecting air and bragging to maintain its life. Everyone knows that it can't last long!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 解放鞍山法库我歼匪整两师　东北冬季攻势第五次大捷\n\n1948-02-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　解放鞍山法库我歼匪整两师\n  　东北冬季攻势第五次大捷\n    【新华社东北前线廿一日急电】解放军十九日晚歼敌两个整师，收复鞍山、法库两城，俘获正清查中。我军系于十九日晨七时二十五分起，发起对鞍山之总攻。经十六小时许激战，至十九日二十四时，在市区内全歼守敌五十二军二十五师及交警一部，无一漏网，收复远东著名的“钢都”鞍山城。被围于法库孤城之敌新六军暂六十二师，于十五日向南突围不逞后，十七日下午五时再度向东北突围，我当即堵击尾追，经两日三夜之猛烈追歼，最后于十九日二十一时，在法库、昌图间将该敌全部捕歼，法库城当为我收复。至此，我军冬季攻势已五次大捷，歼敌七个整师，解放了沈阳外围的第十二、十三座城市。按敌二十五师前年十一月曾被全歼于宽甸西北，此为补充后重歼。又敌暂六十二师系去年我秋季攻势后，由前蒋匪东北行营之特务团、新六军一六九师一个团及保安团合编而成，全部美械装备。\n    【新华社东北二十日电】日前记者在前线某地访问刚从辽阳战役中被俘的蒋匪暂五十四师副师长曹济民。他是安东凤城人，今年五十岁，东北讲武堂第七期毕业，“九一八”事变后即在汉奸殷汝耕的“冀东自治政府”工作，日本投降后，回到安东替国民党组织“地下军”。谈到目前蒋匪内部的生活状况，他说：“当兵的已经两个月没发饷了，高粱米也吃不饱，我们师的士兵多半是安东人，一看形势不好，谁还肯白白送死呢？我们现在怕贵军（指解放军）就象满清末年的清兵害怕革命党一样，大家一提起打仗就头痛”。记者问他对东北目前形势的看法，他说：“我们那里（指蒋匪）就象害第三期的肺病一样，全靠打空气针吹牛皮来维持寿命，这是谁也知道维持不久的！”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th. In a certain offensive battle north of Shenyang, the explosion team and the machine gun team of the 1st and 10th companies of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army implemented a \"contract for meritorious service,\" which had a significant impact. When the 10th company was dispatched, it pre-selected an explosion team as the main force to complete the breakthrough mission. After deliberation, inspiration, and mobilization, the team formulated a plan for meritorious service, determined to undertake the explosion task. After the team's enthusiasm was ignited, it was mobilized to select a machine gun team to provide fire cover. After discussion, the first group of the machine gun squad of the first platoon and the third group of the machine gun squad of the second platoon were selected, and then small artillery, ladder, and rescue teams were selected. After the instructor mobilized the machine gun team, the explosion team and the machine gun team were organized to jointly study the coordinated actions to complete the task, announced the plan for meritorious service, expressed their determination, guaranteed each other, and seized the time for joint exercises, which made them more closely prepared in terms of ideology and action. Finally, the explosion task was completed in the struggle. After the evaluation of meritorious service, the explosion team and the machine gun team were awarded major and minor merits respectively. The situation of the contract for meritorious service between the explosion team and the machine gun team of the 1st company was roughly the same. The contract team members of the two companies all believed that this method of contracting for meritorious service had a serious plan, a particularly strong determination, and a comparison between each other, and their enthusiasm was also high. The unit's research believes that contracting for meritorious service has the following advantages: First, there is a center. Based on the current specific task (such as attacking a fortified position), the central group (such as the explosion team) promotes other groups (such as the machine gun team) to jointly establish meritorious service. Second, the plan for meritorious service is very specific, and it can achieve the effect of mutual cooperation, mutual guarantee, and mutual responsibility. Third, it can give full play to collective strength, and various units and personnel can be formed into a strict combat whole, so that everyone can exert their strength and strive to complete the common task. Now the unit is improving and promoting this method.\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has been practicing plains warfare tactics in the outskirts of Shenyang for days. Before the exercise, cadres above the company level were convened for specific research, and points that should be paid attention to in plains operations were put forward. Cadres at all levels were also formed into companies, and they were assigned to be squad, platoon, and company commanders. After hypothetical situations and detailed discussions, the exercise was held. All cadres were serious and responsible, as if they were in a real battle. After the cadres returned to their original units, they immediately created a wave of exercises.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-24",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: A spokesperson for the CCP Central Committee today vehemently denounced Truman's special message to the U.S. Congress on the 18th, requesting approval of $570 million in aid to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The spokesperson pointed out that the U.S. imperialist conspiracy aims to prolong China's civil war and is part of an adventurous and aggressive plan by U.S. imperialism to enslave the people of the East, enslave the people of the world, and undermine world peace. The spokesperson said: The American wolf is now trying to put on sheep's clothing, saying that \"the United States is extremely concerned about the continued decline of the Chinese economy.\" But everyone knows that any loan, material, or military supplies that the U.S. government has given to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang since the war, including the $570 million that Truman proposed this time, have been used to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fight the civil war. Anyone familiar with the situation in China knows that as long as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang exists, it will sooner or later launch an anti-people civil war. However, without the support and assistance of U.S. imperialism, the day the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched the civil war would be delayed, and the day it perished due to the failure of the civil war would be earlier.\n\nThe spokesperson said: Every instance of U.S. imperialism aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang comes at the cost of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang selling out Chinese sovereignty. China's sacred sovereignty has been seized by U.S. imperialists time and time again under the guise of \"aid to China.\" The price for this $570 million has already been secretly negotiated between the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's compradors, such as H. H. Kung, Yu Ta-wei, and Bei Zugen, and the U.S. imperialists. This includes opening up China's inland river navigation rights to the United States, U.S. supervision rights over South China, and various conveniences for U.S. merchants. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang shamelessly hands over national sovereignty to U.S. imperialism because none of the so-called economic aid, surplus materials, and relief supplies that U.S. imperialism provides to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are not actually military aid. The so-called \"economic aid\" and \"relief supplies\" from U.S. imperialism not only enable the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to obtain aircraft, artillery, various weapons, ammunition, and military equipment from the United States, but can also be used to purchase munitions from other countries. For example, last year, the Chiang bandits purchased 160 tons of ammunition from Belgium, of which 110 tons were transported to Hong Kong by the so-called relief agency, the CNRRA, at the end of October. U.S. military personnel are helping Chiang Kai-shek train troops not only in Taiwan but also in Nanjing, Shenyang, Beiping, Xuzhou, Xi'an, Hankou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Shaoguan, and even Xinjiang. American personnel participate in all troop training institutions, training Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the use of new weapons to massacre the Chinese people. The spokesperson further pointed out: The ambition of U.S. imperialism does not stop at enslaving the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are colluding with each other, delaying the peace treaty with Japan, restoring Japanese military industry, and supporting Japanese and Korean fascist forces in order to revive Japan and help U.S. imperialism enslave the 1 billion people of the East. Furthermore, they will serve as porters for U.S. imperialism when it launches the so-called Third World War in the distant future. All of this is the true content of Truman's so-called \"establishment of a just and lasting environment of peace throughout the world.\" In order to realize this kind of imperialist wild plan, the monopoly capitalists of Wall Street are cruelly exploiting the American people, using the American people's blood and sweat as new adventurous investments. The spokesperson said: Even so, people should not mistakenly believe that the cooperation between Truman, Chiang Kai-shek, and all American puppets in the East, and the billions of dollars in aid-to-Chiang plans, will have any significant effect. These collaborations and assistance do, of course, have some effect, which is like the effect of a stimulant before a patient's death. The current world situation has changed to a position that is extremely unfavorable to U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and extremely favorable to the democratic forces of the people of the world. Within just two years of the end of World War II, the entire capitalist world has become chaotic and is moving towards even greater chaos. The democratic forces of the people of the world have greatly developed and are moving towards even greater development. The advantage lies with the democratic forces, not with the reactionary forces. The money and guns of the reactionaries are not a real advantage. People hate the reactionaries, do not approve of the reactionaries, and unite to oppose the reactionaries and fight against the reactionaries. This power is the real advantage. Before the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched the civil war, they received $4 billion in assistance from U.S. imperialists and equipment left behind by 1 million Japanese troops. Chiang Kai-shek himself had more than 4 million troops. All of this should have been considered an advantage compared to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, in just one year, the People's Liberation Army has repelled Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and turned itself into an offensive force. Does this concrete fact not sufficiently illustrate that the advantage of money and guns alone, the advantage of material alone, cannot be considered a real advantage, and that only the sum of people's hearts and material, that is, the revolutionary power of the people, is the real advantage? If such a large amount of U.S. aid in the past not only failed to enable the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to achieve victory, but also led to such a serious defeat, then what significant effect will the new loan of $570 million have? The spokesperson said: The Chinese people must understand that U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek are bound to make a dying struggle, and we must prepare for a persistent struggle in order to finally defeat them. However, every act of treason by the traitors and their foreign masters, every new loan from the reactionary American government to its Chinese lackeys, has aroused and will continue to arouse the anger of the Chinese people. This anger will be transformed into strength, accelerating the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The spokesperson called on all soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas and all the people of China to eliminate any cowardly and incompetent thoughts of fearing U.S. imperialism in their ranks, strengthen the unity of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, liberal bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and all other patriotic elements, oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism, continue the revolutionary offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中央发言人  痛斥杜鲁门援蒋咨文　号召继续向蒋匪展开革命的进攻\n\n1948-02-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中央发言人\n    痛斥杜鲁门援蒋咨文 　号召继续向蒋匪展开革命的进攻\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】中共中央发言人，今日痛斥杜鲁门十八日向美国国会要求批准以五亿七千万美元援助蒋介石匪帮的特别咨文，指出美国帝国主义的阴谋是为了延长中国的内战，是美国帝国主义奴役东方人民，奴役世界人民，破坏世界和平的冒险的侵略计划的一部分。发言人说：美国的狼现在还要披上羊皮，说什么“中国经济之继续衰落美国实极关怀”，可是谁都知道：美国政府在大战以后给与蒋介石匪帮的任何一笔借款、物资、军火、包括这次杜鲁门所提出的五亿七千万美元在内，都是用来帮助蒋介石匪帮打内战的。熟悉中国情形的人都知道，只要蒋介石匪帮存在一天，它迟早总会发动反人民的内战，但是如果没有美国帝国主义的撑腰与援助，蒋介石匪帮发动内战的日子会迟一些，其因内战失败而灭亡的日子会早一些。\n    发言人说：美国帝国主义对于蒋介石匪帮的每一次援助，都是以蒋介石匪帮对中国主权的出卖为代价的。中国的神圣主权，在美国帝国主义者“援华”声中，一次又一次被美国帝国主义者攫取去了。此次五亿七千万美元的代价，已由蒋介石匪帮的大买办孔祥熙、俞大维、贝祖诒等，与美国帝国主义者秘密商定，其中包括向美国开放中国的内河航行权，美国对华南的监督权，和给美国商人以种种便利等。蒋介石匪帮如此无耻的把国家主权送给美国帝国主义，因为美国帝国主义给与蒋介石匪帮的所谓经济援助，所谓剩余物资，所谓救济物资等，实际上没有一件不是军事援助。美国帝国主义的所谓“经济援助”与“救济物资”，不仅使蒋介石匪帮能从美国方面得到飞机大炮，各种武器弹药，与军用器材，并且可以用来向别国购买军火。例如去年蒋匪就曾向比利时购买弹药一百六十吨，其中一百一十吨已于十月底由所谓救济机关的行总运到香港。美国军事人员帮助蒋介石训练军队，已经不限于台湾一地，而且在南京、沈阳、北平、徐州、西安、汉口、成都、重庆、韶关以至新疆，所有训练军队的机关，都有美国人员参加，训练蒋介石匪军使用新式武器，屠杀中国人民。发言人进一步指出：美国帝国主义的野心，还不止于奴役中国人民。美国帝国主义与蒋介石匪帮，正在狼狈为奸，拖延对日和约，恢复日本军事工业，扶植日、韩法西斯势力，以便重新扶起日本，帮助美国帝国主义来奴役东方十万万人民；并在美国帝国主义者于遥远的将来，发动所谓第三次世界大战时，充当美国帝国主义的轿夫。所有这些，就是美国帝国主义者杜鲁门的所谓“建立全世界公正持久之和平环境”的真实内容。为要实现此种帝国主义的狂妄计划，华尔街的独占资本家们残酷的剥削美国人民，拿美国人民的血汗来作新的冒险的投资。发言人说：虽然如此，可是人们不要误认杜鲁门、蒋介石及东方一切美国傀儡们的互相合作，多少亿元的援蒋计划，会有什么了不起的作用。这些合作与援助，当然有一点作用，这就是病人临死前的强心剂的作用。现在世界形势已变到于美国帝国主义及各国反动派极端不利，而于世界人民民主力量极端有利的地位。第二次世界大战结束仅仅两年时间之内，整个资本主义世界业已混乱不堪，并正在走向更大的混乱局面。而世界人民民主势力，则有极大的发展，并正在走向更大的发展局面。优势是在民主力量方面，不是在反动力量方面。反动派的金钱和枪炮，并不是什么真正的优势，人心讨厌反动派，不赞成反动派，人们团结起来反对反动派，并和反动派作斗争，这个力量才是真正的优势。在蒋介石匪帮发动内战以前，曾经得到美国帝国主义者四十亿美元的帮助，又得到日本一百万军队留下的装备，蒋介石自己有四百多万军队，所有这些和中国人民解放军比较起来，应该算得是优势了，然而仅仅一年工夫，人民解放军即已打退了蒋介石的进攻，并使自己转入了进攻。这个具体事实，难道还不足以说明单是金钱和枪炮的优势，单是物质的优势，不能算是真正的优势，而只有人心加物质的总和，只有掌握物质的人们，即是说人民的革命力量，才是真正的优势吗？如果过去如此大量的美国援助，不但不能使蒋介石匪帮得到胜利，而且使他们得到如此严重的失败，那么五亿七千万美元的新借款，又会有什么了不起的作用呢？发言人说：中国人民必须明白美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石是一定要作垂死挣扎的，我们必须准备坚持的斗争，方能最后战胜他们。但是每一次卖国贼与其外国主人的丧权辱国的勾当，每一次美国反动政府给其中国走狗的新借款，已经激起并且还要激起中国人民的愤怒，这种愤怒将转化为力量，加速蒋介石匪帮的灭亡。发言人号召解放区全体军民与全中国人民，肃清自己队伍里任何惧怕美国帝国主义的懦弱无能的思想，加强工人、农民、小资产阶级、自由资产阶级、知识分子与一切其他爱国分子的团结，反对美国帝国主义的侵略，继续向蒋介石匪帮展开革命的进攻，把蒋介石匪帮坚决彻底干净全部的消灭掉！"

    "content": "Viewing the Price Fluctuations in the Chiang Area: Chiang Kai-shek's Economy Heads Towards Total Collapse\n\n　　The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in order to extract the blood and sweat of the people, frantically printed money. By the end of last year, the total amount of Chiang currency issued into the market had exceeded 100 trillion yuan. The new banknotes issued this year are worth 100,000 yuan each. The more banknotes printed, the less they are worth, and prices keep rising. In addition, the Chiang bandits are constantly being hit by the iron fists of our People's Liberation Army. Large areas of villages in Northeast China, North China, and Central China have become liberated areas, using our Jinnan currency, Beihai currency… and no longer using Chiang Kai-shek's currency. These Chiang Kai-shek currencies from these places all flow into the Chiang-controlled areas. With a smaller Chiang-controlled area, the currency seems even more abundant. The bandit gang members, seeing that Chiang Kai-shek is failing and nearing his end, also take advantage of the situation, fish in troubled waters, and engage in speculative trading. As a result, things become even more expensive, and the people in the Chiang area are suffering immensely. For example, in Yuci, near Taiyuan in Yan Xishan's territory, a half-tael (approximately 18.5 grams) sesame cake now sells for 5,000 yuan. It will definitely rise further. According to newspapers in Tianjin in the Chiang-controlled area, the prices in Shanghai, the economic center of the Chiang area, were 180,000 times higher at the end of last year than before the Anti-Japanese War. It rose fifteen times within the last year, which is the highest in the world after World War II.\n\n　　From February last year to February this year, prices in the Chiang area have increased sharply seven times:\n\n　　The first time was in February last year, taking rice as an example, the price per dan (approximately 50 kg) rose to 60,000 yuan. The second time was from early April to early June, rising to 220,000 yuan. The third time was from late June to mid-July, rising to 500,000 yuan. The fourth time was from mid-August to the end of October, rising to 900,000 yuan. The fifth time was from mid-November to the end of December, rising to 1.2 million yuan. The sixth time was from January 2nd this year, rising to 1.5 million yuan. The seventh time was from February 2nd, when rice sold for 1.55 million yuan per dan.\n\n　　By February 5th, the price rose to 1.66 million yuan per dan. On the 6th, it was 1.8 million yuan per dan. On the 16th, it soared again to 2.1 million yuan per dan.\n\n　　From these trends of price increases, the following points can be seen: The first time it took a month to stop rising slightly, the second time it took two months, the third time it stopped after a month because the Chiang bandits used \"economic secret agents\" to brutally suppress it, while the fourth time it took two months to stop rising slightly; the fifth time it took a month and a half to stop rising slightly; the distance between the sixth and seventh times was very short, almost always rising, and has not stopped yet.\n\n　　The time of slight stability between each two price increases is getting shorter and shorter. The interval between the first and second times was one month, between the second and third times was three weeks, between the third and fourth times was one month, between the fourth and fifth times was two weeks, and between the fifth and sixth times was only one week. The interval between the sixth and seventh times was only a few days. According to Shanghai financial observers: \"When this distance is shortened to two weeks to one week, the banknotes will continue to fall, and prices will continue to rise, until it leads to a complete economic collapse.\" Judging from the current trend, it has reached such a point.\n\n　　As the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty heads towards a major military, political, and economic collapse, it will inevitably more frantically exploit the working people and small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, which will inevitably further concentrate the hatred of the broad masses of people, who will rise up and accelerate the final crushing of the Chiang Kai-shek counter-revolutionary dynasty in coordination with the People's Liberation Army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 从蒋区物价波动看蒋介石经济走上大崩溃\n\n1948-02-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　从蒋区物价波动看蒋介石经济走上大崩溃\n    蒋介石匪帮为了搜刮人民的血汗，拼命的印票子；截至去年年底，蒋币发到市面上的总数目已经有一百万亿元以上。今年出的新票子，一张就是十万元；票子印得越多越不值钱，物价就涨个不停。再加上蒋匪到处挨咱人民解放军的铁拳，关东、华北、华中大片大片的乡村都成了解放区，用的都是咱冀南票、北海票……，不用蒋介石的票子了，这些地方的蒋介石票子都流到蒋管区去。蒋管区地方小了，票子也就显得更多了。匪帮人员看到蒋介石快不行了，离死不远了，就也趁火打劫，混水摸鱼，大做投机买卖。这样，东西就更贵了，蒋区老百姓都苦得没法。象太原旁边榆次阎锡山的地方，眼下一两半重的烧饼就卖五千元。以后一定还是要涨，据蒋管区天津的报上说，蒋区经济中心上海去年年底的物价比抗日战争前高了十八万倍，去年一年之内就涨了十五倍，在第二次世界大战后是世界上最高的。\n    从去年二月到今年二月，蒋区物价就大涨了七次：\n    第一次是在去年二月，拿大米作例子，每担涨到六万元。第二次是四月初至六月初，涨到二十二万元。第三次是六月下旬至七月中旬，涨到五十万元。第四次是八月中到十月末，涨到九十万元。第五次是从十一月中到十二月底，涨到一百二十万元。第六次自今年一月二日起，涨到一百五十万元。第七次是二月二日起，米每担卖一百五十五万元。\n    到二月五日，每担涨到一百六十六万元。六日每担一百八十万元。十六日，就又暴涨到每担二百一十万元。\n    从这些涨风的趋势中，可以看出来下面这几点：第一次是涨了一个月才稍停，第二次涨了两个月，第三次因为蒋匪用“经济特务”横暴镇压涨了一个月就停住了，而第四次又是涨了两个月才稍停；第五次涨了一个半月才稍停；第六、七次之间矩离很短，几乎是一直涨，至今还没有停。\n    每两次上涨中间稍稳定的时间是越来越短了，第一次与第二次中间为一个月，第二次与第三次间为三个星期，第三次与第四次间为一个月，第四次与第五次间为两星期，第五次与第六次间仅为一星期。第六次与第七次中间仅数天。据上海金融界观察家说：“这距离缩短到两星期至一星期的时候，钞票就要不断下跌，物价就要不断上涨，直到促成整个的经济崩溃。”就现在的趋势看，已经到了这样的时候了。\n    当蒋介石王朝军事、政治、经济走上大崩溃的这时候，也必然更疯狂的压榨劳动人民和中小工商业者，而这也必然更集中起广大人民的仇恨，起来加紧配合人民解放军最后打碎蒋介石反革命王朝。"

    "content": "People in the Jiang Area of Xiuwu County\n　　Unable to Bear Oppression, Take Up Arms to Resist Jiang\n　　[Our Newspaper’s News] In the En Village area of Xin’an Township, Xiuwu County, within the Jiang bandit-controlled area, the burden for one mu of land last year was more than one shi of grain and over 200,000 Jiang currency. In addition to this, there were expenses for fodder and the puppet self-defense corps, security office, etc. This January, 2.7 dou of grain and 20,000 currency have already been levied per mu, leaving the common people destitute and suffering. With such a heavy burden, even if they hand over everything, it's not enough. How can the common people afford it? Many lock their doors during the day to avoid the corvee. When the Bao and Jia heads fail to collect enough grain and money, the township office detains them. A few Bao and Jia heads who weren't detained, because of the intense pressure, sought death by hanging themselves. Four Jia heads in Nanlezhuang hanged themselves, one died, and three were rescued. One Jia head in Chouhuazhuang also hanged himself. The fifth Jia head of En Village also hanged himself and died. In addition, several families were driven to jump into wells. Irregular troops constantly urged for grain and money. If they couldn't pay, they would beat and rob. As the New Year approached, the robbing became even more severe. On the 4th of this month, the bandit troops of Wang Fengyin, the puppet Bo’ai County Security Regiment, and Ma Qingnian, the puppet self-defense captain of Zaodian (enemy area), robbed grain and steamed buns in villages such as Zaodian and Shilin, taking whatever they could find. They robbed twenty-three sheep from the people of Zaodian. Shi Zhidubo of the puppet Fourth Special District Security Regiment sent three plainclothes agents to Jiahetun Village (enemy area) to rob grain. Driven to desperation, the villagers beat these grain collectors, injuring one of them. Nineteen soldiers of the enemy's regular 38th Division came to this village to rob grain, but the villagers pretended to be the Eighth Route Army and scared them away. (Zhe Ying, Fu Lin, Tian Zhong, Yu Rong)\n　　[Taihang News] According to someone who escaped from Yuci City, under the control of the Yan bandits, in the middle of this month: Goods are scarce in Yuci City, Jiang currency is worthless, and prices are exceptionally high. Millet costs as much as 550,000 yuan per dou, equivalent to 40,000 yuan per jin; wheat flour is 52,000 yuan per jin; sorghum flour is 25,000 yuan per jin; black bean cake is 2,000 yuan per jin; bran is 4,000 yuan per jin; a half-liang (1.75 oz) sesame cake is 5,000 yuan; peanuts cost as much as 45,000 yuan per jin; black cotton cloth is 50,000 yuan per chi (foot). Common people and small merchants are secretly saying through tears: \"There's nothing to eat, and they still keep demanding grain and money. If things continue like this, we'll either be forced to death, starve to death, or have to flee to survive.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 修武蒋区人民　不堪压榨武装抗蒋\n哲影　福林　天忠　玉荣\n1948-02-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　修武蒋区人民\n  　不堪压榨武装抗蒋\n    【本报消息】蒋匪统治区修武县新安乡恩村一带，去年一年的负担一亩地就出一石多粮，蒋币廿多万元，除了这还有草料伪自卫队保公所等花消，今年一月份一亩地已派了二斗七升粮两万元款了，弄得老百姓都是缺吃没穿的活受罪。负担这样重，打的全交了还不够，老百姓怎能出起呢？好多老百姓白天都把门锁上出去躲差，保甲长到时候交不齐粮款，乡公所即扣起来，有少数没扣的保甲长，因逼的太紧，寻死上吊的也不少，南乐庄四个甲长上吊了，吊死一个、三个得救未死，仇化庄也吊死一个甲长，恩村五甲甲长也上吊死了。另外还有好几家老百姓逼的跳井了。杂牌队天天催粮要款的不断，给不起就连打带抢，到快过年时就抢的更厉害，本月四日伪博爱县保安团王凤银匪部和造店（敌区）伪自卫队长马庆年到造店、士林等村抢粮馍，见啥抢啥，把造店老百姓的羊抢走二十三只，伪匪四专署保安团时志堵部，派三名便衣队到嘉禾屯村（敌区）抢粮，逼的没法，老百姓就把这讨粮的三个家伙打跑了，还打伤一个，敌人正规军三十八师十九个人到这村来抢粮叫这村的老百姓假装八路军吓跑了。（哲影、福林、天忠、玉荣）\n    【太行消息】据本月中旬从阎匪统治下的榆次城跑出来的某人谈：榆次城货物稀少，蒋币不值钱，物价异常昂贵，小米每斗竟达五十五万元，一斤合四万元；白面一斤五万二千元；高粱面一斤二万五千元；黑豆饼一斤两千元；谷糠一斤四千元；一两半重的烧饼一个五千元；花生一斤竟达四万五千元；黑洋布一尺五万元。老百姓、小商人都含泪偷偷的说：“没吃的，人家天天还催要粮款。象这样下去，不是逼死，就是饿死，要不，只有外逃求生。”"

Detailed battle results are still being investigated.\n　　[News from Taihang] The Taihang Military Commission announced on the 15th of this month that our border militia annihilated more than 700 enemies in January. In the past month, our border militia, militia work teams, and rotation teams have taken the initiative to attack, penetrate deep behind enemy lines, and exert excellent tactics such as joint defense operations and flying mine explosions, inflicting significant casualties on the dying Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops. According to extremely incomplete statistics: In 29 independent operations and 8 coordinated operations with troops, our militia annihilated a total of 767 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops, including 210 killed or wounded, 111 killed or wounded by landmines, 439 enemy squad leaders and below captured alive (including more than 300 members of the Hui team), and 7 defectors.

One militiaman was killed and one wounded.\n　　[News from Taihang] The Yucheng local armed forces of the Second Military District and a part of the main force of the military district penetrated deep behind enemy lines and annihilated 40 Yan bandits in two battles. On the night of the 8th, our Yucheng local armed forces suddenly penetrated behind enemy lines and attacked the enemy stronghold of Dongguo, five miles southeast of the city. This stronghold was stationed by a battalion of the Second Regiment of the Eighth Column of Yan Xishan's army and more than 50 local puppet armed forces. The battle began on the morning of the 9th, and we immediately rushed into the village and fought the enemy for an hour. After destroying an enemy heavy machine gun squad, we took the initiative to withdraw from the battle. In this battle, 26 enemies were killed or wounded, one heavy machine gun, one rifle, more than 2,800 rounds of ammunition, two boxes of heavy machine gun parts, and five livestock were seized. In addition, a part of the main force of our Second Military District also penetrated deep behind enemy lines on the night of the 8th and ambushed at Beizhang Village, ten miles southwest of Taigu City. At noon on the 9th, five plainclothes members of the Dongxianyang Yan bandit police second squadron, puppet village chiefs, and puppet self-defense regiment leaders entered our ambush circle and were all captured alive. One rifle and one pistol, and more than ten rounds of ammunition were seized. The enemy who came out of Dongweiyang to reinforce were also repelled by us.\n　　[News from this newspaper] On the evening of the 9th of this month (the evening of the 30th of the twelfth lunar month), our Xinxiang First District Work Team, taking advantage of the enemy's lack of preparation during the New Year, crossed the Pinghan Road and surrounded the puppet organization in Hetun Village. More than 30 members of the enemy's regular team were drinking and celebrating. Our work team jumped into the courtyard and shouted, \"Lay down your arms and we won't kill you!\" After a series of slogans, not a single shot was fired in the house. Ru Yaolin, the commander of the Xinxiang County Security Regiment, and Wang Xianglin, the captain of the village's regular team, and 11 others were captured alive.

    "content": "North Jiabi Cadres Should Seriously Reflect\n  　Using Fruits of Struggle and Donations to Run a Troupe\n  　Making the Masses Produce for the Village Finances To the Editor:\n    The North Jiabi Troupe of Cixian County, with the support of the village Farmers' Association Chairman Lan Qifu and militia instructor Li Yongfang, used the clothes, fabrics, and silks obtained from the fruits of struggle in the past to make costumes for performing. Last spring, they also took four or five shi of rice and wheat from the fruits of struggle, without informing the masses, to feed the troupe. These two frequently mobilized the masses to donate money. Now they are planning to mobilize 500,000 yuan to buy theatrical trunks. New middle peasant Lan Xicun (manager of the Production and Rejuvenation Goods Station of the district organization) donated 5,000 yuan, and loudly complained. Poor peasant Lan Fengcheng was called in by the Farmers' Association Chairman who said, \"Aren't you going to give 5,000 yuan? You just wait and see!\" Then he wrote down 5,000 yuan. Following this, donations of 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000 yuan were written down one after another. It is estimated that each street can be \"mobilized\" for 80,000 to 100,000 yuan (there are six streets in total). The child of poor peasant Lin Fengyou, named Heizi, joined the troupe, and his mother complained, \"I was angered to death after my child joined the troupe.\" Because the troupe's education of them is very poor, turning the children into petty hooligans. We know that the higher authorities have repeatedly strictly prohibited districts and villages from privately mobilizing people's money to reduce the burden on the people. This village is a disaster area, so this behavior is even more a violation of the orders of the higher authorities and the interests of the masses, and should be corrected.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cixian County Cooperative Communication Group, Bai Zenghao, Yifu To the Editor:\n    Last October, the cadres of North Jiabi Village ordered small mutual aid groups in each street to produce for the village's finances, allocating 100,000 yuan to each street, with a deadline of 50,000 yuan to be completed by the end of December. Poor peasant Lin Fengcheng of the restaurant group in the first street said, \"If it's not completed, we'll have to compensate them!\" Later, after opposition from various parties, the task of 1.45 million yuan was reduced to 600,000 yuan. Lin Qinghai, the Anti-Conscription Director of the first street, and Lin Huafu, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, organized a sheep slaughtering group last winter, requiring the four small cooperatives to invest 250,000 yuan. The restaurant group planned to invest their share of the village finance money into the sheep slaughtering group, but the cadres said, \"That won't work.\" They had to invest an additional 50,000 yuan. This sheep slaughtering group increased waste for the village. The above-mentioned cadre's style of ordering small cooperatives to invest should be changed.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Cixian County Cooperative, Bai Zenghao, Yifu\n    Using the fruits of struggle to organize a troupe is a fundamental violation of the spirit of the Land Law. Indiscriminately apportioning funds to the masses to buy theatrical trunks is an intolerable waste. Ordering small mutual aid groups of the masses to complete the tasks of village finance also violates the correct principle of developing production to solve village financial expenditures. This kind of thing is probably not limited to one village of North Jiabi. It is hoped that all localities will check it out and correct it immediately.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　—Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北贾壁干部应好好反省　用果实和捐款搞剧团　让群众给村财政生产\n白增孝　一夫\n1948-02-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北贾壁干部应好好反省\n  　用果实和捐款搞剧团\n  　让群众给村财政生产编辑同志：\n    磁县北贾壁剧团，在本村农会长兰其富、民兵指导员李用方支持下，过去将斗争果实的衣服和布匹绸缎，做成唱戏衣服。去年春天还拿斗争果实米麦四、五石，没经群众知道，给剧团吃了。这两人经常向群众动员款洋。现在正计划动员五十万元买戏箱。新中农兰喜存（是分区机关生产复兴货栈经理）出了五千元，大喊冤枉。贫农兰凤成被农会长叫去说：“你还不拿五千元？你们看吧！”就给写了五千元。以下的有三千、二千、一千都写开了。每街估计能“动员”八万到十万元（共有六街）。贫农吝凤有孩子名叫黑子，参加了剧团，他娘告人说：“自我孩子参加剧团后，就气死我了。”因为剧团对他们教育很差，将小孩都教成了小流氓了。我们知道上级几次严禁区村私自动员民款，以减轻人民负担。本村是个灾荒区，更是违犯上级命令和群众利益的行为，应注意纠正。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　磁县县联社通讯小组白增孝、一夫编辑同志：\n    去年十月底，北贾壁村干部命令各街小型互助组，给村财政生产，每街分十万元，限期十二月底完成五万元。一街饭铺组贫农吝凤成说：“完不成也得给人家赔咧！”后来经过各方反对，才把一百四五十万元的任务留下六十万元。一街抗勤主任吝清海、农会常委吝华福，去冬组织杀羊组，要四组小型社投资二十五万元。饭铺小组准备将自己接受的村财政款投到杀羊组，干部说：“那不行。”只得另外投去五万元。这个杀羊组给村上增加了浪费。以上干部命令小型社投资的作风，应该改变。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　磁县县联社白增孝、一夫\n    用斗争果实组织剧团，根本违犯土地法的精神，向群众乱派款项买戏箱，更是不能容许的浪费现象。命令群众小型互助组完成村财政的任务，也违背了发展生产解决村财政开支的正确原则。这种事情恐不止北贾壁一个村有，希望各地都来检查一下，即刻纠正。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者"

The Women's Association Director's son was a battalion commander in the Field Army. He died in the Yangshan battle. When they brought his body back, they received a notice to collect flower cloth for military use. The Women's Association Director said: \"Let's delay the funeral for two days. He's already dead anyway, delaying the funeral for two days doesn't matter, weaving military cloth is more important. The soldiers at the front are freezing and suffering, we must let them all be warm.\" At that time, she called together the Women's Association group leaders to discuss the weaving method, and personally took the lead, working day and night.

The Ninth Company of a certain regiment of the Jilin Local Corps of the Jinan Military Region of the Jilin Military Region has not had any desertions in the past two years and was awarded the title of \"Permanent Model Company\" at the recent district hero model conference. The company, shortly after its establishment the year before last, withdrew from Chang(chun) Ji(lin) proactively along with our main force and transferred to Jinan. At that time, 80% of the area was occupied by the enemy. The entire Jinan base area had a population of only over 20,000, and the troops could only operate in the mountainous area of Huadian in Jiangdong. Everyone burned wild firewood and ate corn bran and vegetables, often camping in the open. In winter, before winter clothes were distributed, they were already damaged. Without money to buy thread, they could only sew with hemp rope or stuff *Lala* grass into their cotton trousers to keep warm. According to district statistics, the ratio of trauma to frostbite was one to fifteen. It was not until the summer and autumn offensives last year that the enemy was compressed in Jilin, Changchun, and Jinan, and the situation was opened up. The Ninth Company grew up in such a difficult environment and struggled against hundreds of times more enemies. At the beginning of the establishment of the Ninth Company, there were many problems. Individual soldiers visited women, ate and drank casually, said strange things, and other disciplinary violations. At that time, Instructor Jin Zhong treated these issues very seriously and cautiously. First, he strictly stipulated various systems, and a five-minute review meeting was held every night to review the day's learning and life, even small things were not relaxed. All management was the responsibility of the soldiers themselves, especially letting the naughty soldiers manage. If they didn't manage well, they would review at the review meeting. This gradually improved the soldiers' revolutionary self-esteem and sense of responsibility, and they began to establish a conscious obedience to discipline. In his work, Instructor Jin Zhong did the work of two people. Outside of work hours, he played games and talked with the soldiers. He knew the composition, background, history, personality, and specialties of every soldier in the company very clearly. If a soldier had a problem, he could quickly detect it and immediately conduct individual education. At the same time, all the activists in the company were united around him, and they educated the backward elements anytime and anywhere. Other cadres could also lead by example, letting the soldiers pick things first when distributing them. Everyone rushed to do all the work in the company, and the whole company was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 吉林地方兵团某团九连　荣获“永久模范连”称号\n\n1948-02-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　吉林地方兵团某团九连\n  　荣获“永久模范连”称号\n    【新华社东北十八日电】吉林军区吉南军分区地方兵团某团九连，两年来未曾发生逃亡现象，在最近分区英模大会上荣获“永久模范连”的称号。该连在前年成立不久，即随我军主力从长（春）吉（林）主动撤退，转入吉南，当时百分之八十的地区为敌侵占，整个吉南根据地只有两万多人口，部队仅能活动在江东桦甸一带山区，大家烧野柴，吃苞米糠菜，并经常露营，冬天没有过，棉衣便坏了，没有钱买线，只用麻绳子缝，或把＠拉草塞到棉裤里取暖。据分区统计：那时创伤与冻伤的比例为一比十五，直到去年夏秋攻势展开，敌人被压缩于吉林、长春、吉南局面才打开，九连就是在这样艰苦环境下，并与数百倍敌人斗争中生长起来的。九连建立之初，存在着很多毛病，个别战士逛女人、随便吃喝、说怪话及其他犯纪律的现象。当时指导员金钟非常严肃慎重地对待这些问题，首先严格规定了各种制度，每晚要召开五分钟的检讨会，检讨一天的学习与生活，甚至细小的事情也不放松。各种管理都让战士自己负责，特别让调皮的战士来管，管得不好便在检讨会上检讨，这样使战士的革命自尊心和责任心逐渐提高，开始建立自觉的服从纪律。在工作中，指导员金钟一个人顶上两个人干，在工作时间外，就和战士们一同游戏、谈话，对全连每个战士的成份出身、历史、个性、特长等都了解得非常清楚，某个战士发生问题，他能很快的发觉，并马上进行个别教育，同时全连的积极分子都团结在自己的周围，并通过他们随时随地教育落后分子。其他的干部们也都能以身作则，发东西时，尽先让战士们拣，连里一切工作都是大家抢着做，全连充满了团结友爱的空气。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-24",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Preliminary Study of the Situation in Seven Villages in the Ninth District of Wu'an, Taihang\n\n　　The six villages of Zhao Zhuang, Tian Er Zhuang, He Dong, Qing Yan Si, Shi Er Zhuang, Shi Dong, and He Xi in the Ninth District of Wu'an, with the exception of Qing Yan Si, all began rent reduction and interest rate reduction after 1942, and filling in and making up the difference in 1946, only then did the poor peasants and hired laborers begin to obtain land. The villages are very close to each other (three to five *li*), and the past work was carried out under the same policy, the same steps, and the same style, so from the current perspective, they exhibit many common problems. However, due to the different depths of the work, the class relations and land distribution in each village are not completely the same, so there are also some different characteristics.\n\n　　What common characteristics are displayed?\n\n　　First, the general land has been largely leveled. Landless and land-poor peasants have obtained land after filling in and making up the difference according to the May 4th Directive; however, some land is insufficient, the quality is too poor, and they lack clothing and food. Among the sixteen poor and hired laborer households in Tian Er Zhuang, five are still in debt and eight lack food. Three households have not been allocated land at all, and others have too little good land. In He Xi Village, there are a total of thirty-nine poor and hired laborer households, of which eight lack housing, clothing, and food, and one lacks land. Among the poor and hired laborers in Zhao Zhuang, 10% have not been completely emancipated and lack clothing, food, and good land. In He Dong Village, poor and hired laborers who severely lack land still account for 20%. The general situation in each village is that although the quantity of land is largely leveled, the disparity in quality is very large. Each village has a situation of increasing the output of bad land and suppressing the output of good land. This is a method adopted by the village cadres to cover up their high output of good land. On the surface, the output seems to be filled in almost the same, but in reality, the difference is much greater, and the poor peasants and hired laborers urgently demand redistribution.\n\n　　Second, the distribution of floating property is very unfair, village cadres are greedy and take more of the fruits of victory, they become emancipated excessively, the poor peasants and hired laborers have large deficits, and they urgently demand means of subsistence and means of production. None of the seven villages has a clear account of the fruits of victory; they are all muddled accounts. In He Xi Village, the hidden land and grain money of the landlords discovered in 1943 have not been accounted for to this day. The cadres have all divided the good houses and courtyards of the landlords, but there are still poor peasants with seven people living in a dilapidated house, covered by three broken quilts. The account of the fruits of victory from the spring of 1945 to the autumn of 1946 in Qing Yan Si has never been calculated. Last February, it was announced that all of it would be contributed to the cooperative on behalf of the masses. Land, houses, trees, livestock, etc., since the struggle, have all been sold at a price, but the accounts have never been announced. The floating property and clothing stored in the cooperatives of each village, as well as the over-occupied and embezzled by the cadres, is a very large amount, and the masses universally demand clearance. A good clearance of this account can solve some or most of the difficulties in the means of production and means of subsistence of the masses.\n\n　　Third, the cadres' work style is administrative command, and the masses urgently demand democracy. Zhao Zhuang is the village with the most in-depth movement and relatively normal development of work among these villages, but there is no exception. The masses see the cadres as new stone slabs. They arbitrarily beat, scold, hang, bind, and fine the masses. In their opinion, this can only be considered \"inappropriate\" at most, and \"self-criticism\" is enough, but the masses hold grudges in their hearts and never forget it. In terms of the relationship between cadres and the masses, the cadres are a large faction, a \"swarm.\" The poor peasants in Shi Dong Village say it is \"ten-family democracy.\" Although the cadres are not entirely a mess internally, with both good and bad, and their opinions are not completely consistent, some cadres in each village have not over-occupied the fruits of victory and have not beaten or bound people, but because they have adopted a protective attitude towards those who have made mistakes, the masses view them as a group. Historically, whenever the issue of cadre-mass relations was resolved, the leadership ultimately supported the cadres. The masses believe that such \"face washing\" is \"officials protecting each other,\" and they initially adopt an attitude of distrust towards the working comrades.\n\n　　Fourth, the poor and hired laborer class has not been mobilized and remains an oppressed class. Although they have land today, and some have joined the Party, and some have become cadres, and seem to have \"power,\" in fact, their emancipation was \"bestowed\" upon them, and therefore it is very incomplete. Only a very small number of them have obtained \"power,\" and once they are on stage, they forget their roots. Those who are not in power can only be \"guests.\" The Party in Shi Er Zhuang is manipulated by two bankrupt landlord Party members, and the village chief from a poor and hired laborer background is a \"guest.\"\n\n　　From the preliminary understanding of the above situations, it can be seen that the masses have three major urgent demands: \"Implement democracy and transform cadres,\" \"Clear accounts of the fruits of victory and distribute floating property,\" and \"Draw from the fat to supplement the lean and thoroughly emancipate.\" Among these three demands, the demand for democracy is the most fundamental. Because the masses have realized from historical experience that it is impossible to achieve thorough emancipation without obtaining democratic rights.\n\n　　Based on the materials from these villages, several types are initially proposed for research.\n\n　　The first type is represented by Zhao Zhuang (including Shi Dong Village). The characteristics of this type of village are: the foundation of the Party is better. Among the thirty-nine Party members in Zhao Zhuang, twenty-four are poor and hired laborers. Before the anti-traitor liquidation, the mass movement was contracted by a few cadres. After the May 4th Directive, a group of activists was mobilized, numbering more than one hundred. The last blow to feudal forces was relatively thorough. There is such a group of masses in the village, so the work appears to be active on the surface, able to complete tasks, and everything is in order. When you first enter the village, you will feel that there is no problem. However, if you study carefully, although the foundation of the Party is good and the mistakes made by Party members are relatively small, the masses initially find it difficult to forgive the mistakes of cadres and Party members. They are above the masses and have similarly developed into a kind of dictatorial rule, administrative command, corruption, over-occupation of the fruits of victory, mutual cover-up... of bad work styles, so we must not be deceived by some superficial phenomena. We must support the demands of the masses and transform Party members and cadres without any wavering. The three major urgent demands of the masses mentioned earlier (emancipation, accounting, and democracy) must be realized one by one. But at the same time, it must be noted that the Party in Zhao Zhuang has been tempered, and Party members have a relatively good political awareness. If their mistakes can be corrected in front of the masses, a large part of them can still be good long-term workers for the people. A one-sided view that all Party members are bad and that all Party members are inferior to the masses must be opposed.\n\n　　The second type is represented by He Xi and Tian Er Zhuang. From the perspective of the work foundation, the characteristics of this type of village are that several main old cadres are in power (mostly middle peasants), and the branch does not play a role. He Xi is governed by five major cadres, and Tian Er Zhuang is ruled by the Yang family. Their struggle against the landlords is generally resolute, but they also rule the masses very severely, developing into a small faction that is anti-people. Mutual cover-up is a characteristic after cadres with middle peasant components are in power. They have many concerns and are lenient. Some people do not have major mistakes themselves, but they act as two-faced good people between the people and the cadres. The family rule in Tian Er Zhuang has developed to the point where they can arbitrarily \"throw the masses into the West Ditch\" (beat to death) to intimidate the masses with this kind of terror. The masses in He Xi Village do not know that there is a Communist Party and a branch in their village. They only know that the cadres are powerful. They sometimes say angrily: \"The cadres have replaced the landlords of the past.\" Some newly absorbed poor and hired laborer Party members in the branch often dare not say anything. These villages were not key villages in the past, the villages are small, the leadership does not often inspect, and the responsibility is often entrusted to a few active cadres, which is also one of the reasons for the formation of cadre autocracy. This time, during Party rectification, they often say: \"If the superiors don't tell us to do it, we can't offend the masses.\" Therefore, they must be reviewed and identified by the masses, let them distinguish between right and wrong, merit and demerit, recognize their past mistakes, know their mistakes and correct them, and honestly bow their heads to the masses. Because the Party members in these villages are bad, the masses' understanding of the Party is mistaken. Therefore, during the movement, the masses must be made to recognize the Party and rely on the Party from their own personal experience in order to more fully help rectify the Party.\n\n　　The third type of village is represented by Shi Er Zhuang and Qing Yan Si. The characteristics of this type of village are that the leadership has always been controlled by a few ruffians and bankrupt landlord elements, forming a set of the worst work styles for ruling the masses. Beating, fining, deducting, and detaining are the main weapons of these cadres. Waste, theft, rape, and other evils are committed. Shi Er Zhuang began to establish work in 1942 and was controlled by a ruffian element. Later, it was controlled by two bankrupt landlord elements. During the autumn movement last year, a poor and hired laborer was beaten to death under a false pretext. The emancipation of the masses is poor, and the conflict between cadres and the masses is sharp. When working personnel arrive in the village, before the masses have been mobilized, bad cadres try every means to manipulate and block. After the masses are mobilized, it is easy to develop revenge, and even be used by people who have personal grudges against the cadres. Shi Er Zhuang transferred the worst cadres to the district for reflection, leaving behind the combined mobilization of the masses to rectify the Party, preparing to resolve the issues of these bad elements after the movement comes to an end. Qing Yan Si openly exposed the obstruction of bad cadres to Party rectification. These methods have achieved relatively good results.\n\n　　In addition to the above three types of villages, He Dong Village has some special circumstances—the village has little land and a large population (the relationship between cadres and the masses is not sharp). After drawing from the fat to supplement the lean and returning the fruits of victory, it still cannot solve the difficulties of 20% of the deficit households in terms of land and means of subsistence.\n\n　　The above is only a preliminary study based on the work foundation, as a reference for studying the rural situation in the consolidation of the ranks. This is only an outline understanding. In the gradual deepening of the movement, further understanding must continue to be made.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行武安九区　七个村情况的初步研究\n\n1948-02-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行武安九区\n  　七个村情况的初步研究\n    武安九区赵庄、田二庄、河东、青烟寺、史二庄、石洞、河西等六个村，除青烟寺外，都是在四二年以后，即开始进行减租减息，四六年填平补齐，贫雇才开始得到土地。村与村相距很近（三里到五里），过去的工作又是在一个方针、一个步骤、一个作风下进行的，因此从现在看，便表现出很多共同的问题。但又由于工作的深入程度不同，各个村的阶级关系、土地分配又不完全一样，因此便又有些不同的特点。\n    表现出那些共同的特点呢？\n    第一是一般的土地大体填平，无地少地农民从五四指示填平补齐后，取得土地；但均有一部分土地不够，质量太差，缺衣缺食。田二庄十六户贫雇，目前尚有五户欠债，八户缺吃。有三户根本未分得土地，其他人好地太少。河西村贫雇农共三十九户，其中有八户缺房缺衣缺食，有一户缺土地。赵庄贫雇农中有百分之十尚未彻底翻身，缺衣缺食，缺好地。河东村十分缺乏土地的贫雇还占百分之二十。各村普遍情况是土地数量虽大体填平，但质量上悬殊很大，各村都有提高坏地产量，压低好地产量的情况，这是村干部为了掩护自己得好地产量高，所采取的办法。表面上产量似乎填得差不多，但实际上则差得多，贫雇农迫切要求抽补。\n    第二是浮财分配十分不公，村干部贪污多占果实，翻身过高，贫雇窟窿大，迫切要求生活资料与生产资料。七个村没有一个村的果实帐是清白的，都是一笔糊涂帐。河西村从四三年查出地主的黑地隐瞒的粮款，到现在没有算过帐，干部都分了地主的好房好院，还有贫农却是七口人住一间破房，盖三条破被。青烟寺四五年春天到四六年秋天的果实帐，从未算过，去年二月，才宣布全部代群众入合作社。斗争以来的土地、房屋、树木、牲口等均作价卖出，但帐目则从未宣布。各村合作社所存及干部多占和贪污的浮财、衣物是一个很大的数目，群众普遍要求清理。这笔帐清理得好，可解决一部分或大部分群众的生产资料与生活资料的困难。\n    第三、干部作风行政命令，群众迫切要求民主。赵庄在这几个村中是运动较深入、工作发展较为正常的村庄，也没有例外。群众看干部是当作新石板来看的。他们对群众随意打、骂、吊、捆、罚，在他们觉得，这顶多只能算是“不应该”，“检讨检讨”就算了，群众则记恨在心，念念不忘。从干部对群众的关系上讲，干部是一个大宗派，“一窝蜂”。石洞村贫农说是“十家民主”。虽然干部内部亦并不完全是一团糟，有好有坏，意见并不完全一致，各村均有一些干部并未多占果实，并未打人捆人，但由于他们对犯错误的人采取的是包庇态度，因此群众对他们的看法是当作一个集团来看的。历史上每次解决干群问题时，领导上最后都是给干部撑了腰。群众认为这样的“洗脸擦黑”是“官官相卫”，现在对工作同志最初还采取不信任态度。\n    第四、贫雇阶层并没有发动起来，仍然是受压迫阶层。虽然他们今天有了土地，而且有一部分入了党，还有的当了干部，似乎也有“权”了。其实，他们翻身是被“恩赐”的，因而也就很不彻底。他们之中只有很少数的得了“权”，上了台，就忘了本。没在掌权的，只能做“陪客”，史二庄的党就是在两个破落地主党员手中操纵着，贫雇出身的村长做“陪客”。\n    从以上几种情况的初步了解中，可以看出，群众有三大迫切要求：“实行民主，改造干部”，“清算果实，分配浮财”，“抽肥补瘦，彻底翻身”，这三种要求中，民主要求又是最基本的。因为群众从历史的经验中，已认识到，不能求得民主权利，彻底翻身是不可能的。\n    根据这几个村的材料，初步的提出几种类型来研究。\n    第一种类型以赵庄作代表（包括石洞村），这类村的特点是：党的基础较好，赵庄三十九个党员中，廿四个是贫雇。反奸清算以前的群众运动是少数干部包办的，五四指示后，发动了一批积极层，人数有一百多，最后一次对封建势力的打击是比较彻底的。村里边有了这样一批群众，因此工作从表面上看是活跃的，能完成任务，一切都是次序井然，初一进村，会感到没啥问题。但如果仔细研究，党的基础虽好，党员犯的错误也比较小，但干部、党员的错误，群众最初很难原谅。他们在群众之上，同样的发展成为一种独断统治、行政命令、贪污腐化、多占果实、相互包庇……的恶劣作风，因此我们就不能被一些表面的现象所迷惑，必须支持群众要求，改造党员干部，不能有丝毫动摇。前边所提的群众的三大迫切要求（翻身、算帐、民主），均必须一一实现。但同时还必须注意，赵庄的党是经过锻炼了的，党员有着比较好的政治觉悟，如果他们的错误能在群众面前得到改正，他们当中很大一部分还是可以当人民的好长工。有一种片面的认为党员一切皆坏，一切党员不如群众的说法，是必须反对的。\n    第二种类型以河西、田二庄为代表。从工作基础上看，这类村的特点是几个主要的老干部掌权（其中中农多），支部不起作用。河西是五大干部专政，田二庄是姓杨的一姓家族的统治。他们对地主的斗争一般是坚决的，但他们对群众也统治的很厉害，发展成为一个反人民的小宗派。相互包庇是中农成份干部掌权后的特点，他们顾虑多，讲情面，有些人自己的错误不大，但却在人民与干部中间，充当两面好人。田二庄的家庭统治，发展到可随意将群众“扔到西沟去”（捣死），用这种恐怖手段来威吓群众。河西村群众，根本不知道在他们村里就有共产党，就有支部，只知道干部厉害，他们有时气愤地说：“干部代替了过去的地主。”支部里有些新吸收的贫雇党员，经常不敢吭气。这类村过去不是基点村，村子较小，领导上不常检查，把责任经常委托给几个积极干部，也是形成干部独断专制的原因之一。这次整党，他们常常说：“上面不叫咱干，咱也得罪不了群众。”因此必须经过群众审查鉴定，让他们分清是非功过，认识自己过去的错误，知错改错，老老实实向群众低头。这些村由于党员坏，影响到群众对党的认识发生错觉，因此必须在运动中，使群众从自己的切身经验中，认识党依靠党以便更加充分的帮助整党。\n    第三种类型村以史二庄、青烟寺为代表。这类村的特点是领导一贯被少数流氓、破落地主分子把持，形成一套最坏的统治群众的作风。打、罚、扣、押是这类干部的主要武器，浪费、偷窃、强奸等无恶不作。史二庄从四二年开始建立工作，就被一个流氓分子掌权，后来由两个破落地主分子掌权，在去年秋季运动中，曾借故打死一个贫雇。群众翻身较差，干群对立较尖锐，工作员一到村，在群众尚未发动起来之前，坏干部想尽各种办法操纵封锁。当群众发动起来之后，又很容易发展报复，甚至易被对干部有私恨的人利用。史二庄将最坏的干部调区反省，留下的结合发动群众整党，准备运动告一段落，再解决这些坏分子的问题。青烟寺公开揭发坏干部对整党的阻碍。这些办法都收到比较好的效果。\n    除以上三种类型村外，河东村又有些特殊情况——该村地少人多，（干群关系不尖锐）经过抽补，退出果实，仍不能解决百分之二十的窟窿户的土地与生活资料的困难。\n    以上仅系根据工作基础初步研究，作为整顿队伍中研究农村情况的参考，这还只是轮廓的了解，在运动逐步深入中，还必须继续再作了解。"

In the past year, the price of white rice rose from 27,500 Chiang Kai-shek currency per dan to 380,000, an increase of nearly 14 times. \"Chick\" brand poplin rose from 190,000 to 3.5 million per bolt, an increase of more than 18 times. Salt even rose 23 times. As prices soared, the actual income of citizens decreased daily. According to the Chiang Kai-shek central government's standards, the purchasing power of provincial civil servants' salaries in January last year was 22% of the pre-war level (June 1937), 14% in August, and about 9% in December. The tax burden on citizens is extremely heavy. Last year alone, the \"emergency security fee\" in the seven cities of Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Nanning, Guixian, Yulin, and Baise reached 24 billion yuan. The situation in rural areas is even more desolate. The province's average annual grain output is more than 510 million dan, which is still 50 million dan short of the province's consumption. The output in 1945 was sharply reduced to only 250 million dan. In the following two years, there were successive disasters. In 1946, more than 3 million farmers suffered from disasters, and in 1947, more than 1 million. However, Chiang Kai-shek's conscription of military grain has not relaxed at all. In 1946, 3 million dan were forcibly requisitioned, and another 2.5 million dan were requisitioned in 1947. The concentration of land is also alarming. Chiang Kai-shek's high-ranking officials and dignitaries are the most aggressive in annexation. In Longsheng County in northeastern Guangxi, all the land in the county is concentrated in the hands of a few large landlords, and tenant farmers account for 70% of the rural population. In Xing'an County, with a population of 140,000, nearly 90,000 are tenant farmers. In Rong County, southeastern Guangxi, the hometown of Chiang Kai-shek's Guangxi Province Chairman Huang Xuchu, bureaucrats and large landlords own land with rents of 10,000 to 20,000 dan. Rural interest rates are mostly in kind. When farmers in Xing'an borrow one dan of grain from landlords during the lean season, they have to pay five to eight dou of interest when the autumn harvest comes. During the disasters of the past two years, landlords took advantage of the situation even more. In the Pingle area, borrowing one dan required returning two to three dan, and in Yangshuo and Quan counties, it was as high as five dan. Farmers were even forced to sell their children. A folk song popular in the Pingnan area says: \"Selling children is a common thing, thinking carefully, it is cannibalism. Afraid to hear mother crying when I return, a ten-year-old child for a dou of millet.\" In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's frantic conscription of soldiers has led to popular uprisings in Guangxi in recent years. Chiang Kai-shek's officials also admit that the areas of popular uprisings cover the rural areas of 120 townships in 22 counties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 广西民变遍二十二县\n\n1948-02-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　广西民变遍二十二县\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】综合蒋区报纸消息：蒋匪压榨下的广西城乡人民均穷困不堪。该省省会桂林市物价不断飞涨，去年一年中白米每担由蒋币二万七千五，涨到三十八万，上升近十四倍；雏鸡牌士林布每匹由十九万涨到三百五十万，上升十八倍以上；食盐更上涨到二十三倍；房租一般涨了二十倍。在物价高涨下市民的实际所得日益降低，省级公务员薪津的购买力，按蒋匪中央的标准，去年一月份为战前（一九三七年六月）百分之二十二，八月份为百分之十四，十二月份则约为百分之九。市民的捐税负担则极苛重，桂林、柳州、梧州、南宁、贵县、郁林、百色七个城市去年仅“紧急保安费”一项，即达二百四十亿元。农村现状尤为凋敝：该省粮食常年产量为五亿一千余市担，较全省消费量尚差五千万市担，一九四五年产量复锐减，仅二亿五千万市担；此后两年又连遭灾荒，四六年遭灾农民达三百余万，四七年亦一百余万，而蒋匪勒索军粮毫不放松，四六年强征三百万市担，四七年又征二百五十万市担。土地集中亦甚惊人：蒋匪之达官显要兼并最烈，桂东北龙胜县全县土地集中于几家大地主，佃农达农村人口百分之七十；兴安全县人口十四万，佃农将近九万人。蒋匪桂省主席黄旭初的家乡桂东南容县，官僚兼大地主者均拥地租一万至二万担。农村利息多为实物，兴安农民在青黄不接时向地主借谷一担，转眼秋收，即须付息五斗到八斗，在前两年的灾荒中，地主更趁火打劫，平乐一带借一担还两担到三担，阳朔及全县更高达五担。农民甚至被迫卖儿鬻女，平南一带流行民谣说：“卖儿本事寻常事，仔细思量人吃人，回来怕听阿娘哭，十岁婴孩一斗粟”。加以蒋匪疯狂抓丁，故年来桂省民变蜂起，蒋匪官方亦承认：民变地区遍及二十二县一百二十乡镇的农村。"

Four UN relief and rehabilitation administration (UNRRA) fishing boats are already on their way to Hainan. Since August 1946, 126 UNRRA fishing boats have come to China one after another, invading the coastal waters of Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangdong, Taiwan, and Qingdao for fishing. Among those allocated to the Shanghai area, 24 went fishing during the May fishing season last year, catching more than 1.5 million catties of fish, accounting for 25% of the total Shanghai fish market. The number of fishing boats going out to sea during the October fishing season increased to 30, and further increased to more than 50 in December. As a result of the large-scale dumping of fish caught by UNRRA fishing boats in Shanghai, the fish market was crowded and the supply exceeded demand. Fish prices plummeted, causing a crisis of bankruptcy for Shanghai's general private fisheries. UNRRA fishing boats enjoy various privileges in China. They do not need to hold any licenses, nor do they need to declare or pay taxes. Since there is no cost, they can sell fish cheaply at will and still obtain huge profits.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 把海南岛作为渔业基地　美帝侵我华南渔业\n\n1948-02-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　把海南岛作为渔业基地\n  　美帝侵我华南渔业\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】上海消息：美帝为加强对华南渔业侵略，已决定以琼岛西南海岸为美国“发展”华南渔业基地，联总渔轮四艘已在驶琼途中。按自一九四六年八月起，陆续来华之联总渔轮已达一百二十六艘，分别侵入上海、厦门、广东、台湾、青岛沿海捕鱼。分配在上海区域活动者，去年五月份渔泛期出渔二十四艘，获鱼一百五十余万斤，占上海鱼市场总量百分之二十五，十月份渔泛期出渔渔轮增至三十艘，十二月份更增至五十余艘。联总渔轮获鱼在沪大肆倾售结果，渔货拥挤，供过于求，鱼价惨跌，使上海一般民营渔业面临破产危机。联总渔轮在华享有各种特权，可不持任何执照，也不需报关缴税，不需成本，故可任意贱价售鱼，而又能获得巨大利润。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Hedong Has Little Land and Many Debt-Ridden Households;\n    One-Quarter of Farmers Lack Land\n  　A Typical Poor Village Representative for Study by Various Regions\n    [Our News] Hedong Village is a well-known poor village in the Ninth District of Wu'an. Before the disaster year (1942), the village had about 500 people in over 120 households, with about 12 *qing* of land, averaging about 2-2.5 *mu* per person. At that time, about 80 percent of the village were landless or land-poor farmers. Their options were to work as long-term laborers or short-term workers for landlords in nearby villages, gather firewood, do carpentry, or go to Manchuria. Most farmers were in debt. Only four households in Hedong Village had more land, but even in their heyday, the four families combined had no more than 300 *mu* of land. After the Double Reduction (anti-Japanese policy to reduce rent and interest), this was weakened. After the May 4th Directive, the household with the most land among these four had no more than 50 *mu*, and the least had less than 40 *mu*. It was impossible to meet the needs of all the landless and land-poor farmers in the village with just these four households. The reasons for the scarcity of land and the poverty of the people were not only the exploitation by the rich peasants in the village, but also the exploitation of land rent and debt interest by landlords in nearby villages (Hexi, Shidong, and Tian'erzhuang), which made it impossible for the farmers in the village to rise up. Some land was also mortgaged and seized. Before the disaster year, except for the \"Four Great Families,\" almost every household lacked food, and everyone was starving. About one-tenth of the villagers fled. Many people were lost or starved to death. Meng Yuekui, a poor peasant, had a family of six, but only he and his son were left. The Zeng family of four starved to death, losing half of their members. \"If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army here, Hedong would have been completely finished in that disaster year.\" \"The Eighth Route Army transported relief grain to the people through the enemy's blockade,\" the masses of Hedong always remember. However, this relief grain did not completely reach the people's stomachs, and some cadres helped each other. Meng Zhaoshun, a poor peasant, stole seventeen (or two handfuls) black beans from the cooperative and was detained for three days, empty-bellied. His wife had to bring him some boiled water. As a result, he lost three *mu* of land to pay off the \"fine.\"\n    Before and after the disaster year, landlords in nearby villages evaded burdens, and land prices plummeted. After the Double Reduction, Hedong Village bought a considerable amount of land (mostly from Shidong Village). In addition, the county government allocated about 40 *mu* of public land confiscated from traitors, increasing year by year. Up to now, the land has increased from about 12 *qing* to 17 *qing* and more than 70 *mu* (the population has remained roughly the same, and the number of households has increased to 152 due to separate residences). As a result, the lives of the masses and class relations have undergone great changes. Looking at the 26 households in the Fifth *Lü*: in 1940-1942, the average land per person was only 2.06 *mu*; after the Double Reduction, in 1943, the average was 2.70 *mu* per person; after the May 4th Directive, it rose to 3.44 *mu* per person. Although the land has increased, the lives of poor and hired farmers are still very hard. Among the 26 households in the Fifth *Lü*, five households have absolutely insufficient land, accounting for a little less than 20 percent. Three households have difficulty with food, accounting for 13 percent. Fifteen households have no livestock at all or the livestock is unusable, accounting for a little less than 57.7 percent. The least land per person is 2.16 *mu*, and the most is 4.16 *mu*. (The Third *Lü* has a larger gap, with the least land being 2.08 *mu* and the most being 6.19 *mu*). In addition, houses and farm tools are generally lacking, and some landless poor have not yet been allocated housing. Meng Xianduo, an old couple, a young couple, and a child live together in one room and sleep on one *kang*. Many houses have nowhere to shelter when it rains.\n    None of the main officials in the village are poor or hired peasants. The village chief, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, the director of finance and grain, the director of civil affairs, the managers and deputy managers of the cooperative, and the director of preferential treatment for revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are all old middle peasants who have been village cadres for many years. When distributing fruits and assigning burdens, the cadres mostly consider their own interests. Land is not distributed, but rather priced and sold or exchanged. The poor and hired peasants cannot afford it, and good land and nearby land mostly fall into the hands of the cadres. The remaining or exchanged sandy beach land, distant land, and fragmented land are then used to \"fill the holes.\" The \"support\" for the one and a half *mu* of land given to the extremely poor Li Xiaolin is in fifteen or sixteen pieces, and he is also criticized for being lazy and unwilling to cultivate it. The order of distribution of floating property fruits is: families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, cadres, and activists. Only the remaining scraps are given to the poor and hired peasants. Wheat Security's wife spent 5,000 yuan to buy a broken jar that she couldn't use when she got it home, and the old man Niu Security was given a woman's jacket. Most of the twenty-four revolutionary martyrs and soldiers' families in the village are middle peasants or new middle peasants. In addition to distributing fruits, they are given an extra three points, and they have all become wealthy households. Another part of the floating property is not distributed, but rather invested in cooperative shares or transferred to village finances, and cadres spend it on business trips. The cadres and activists have formed a small group of thirty-two people. The political director said: \"With these thirty-two people, I can do any work.\" They cannot see the masses, and the masses dare not speak at meetings for fear of saying something wrong, and then people will shout slogans; they are afraid of being asked: \"What kind of thinking do you have?\" The political director's mule died. At a meeting of key cadres, they felt that the cooperative's mule should be sold to him. After the decision, they arranged for activists to have a \"democratic discussion\" at the farmers' association. The masses saw that the cadres' speeches were unanimous, so they dared not say anything. The cadres flaunt their achievements in front of the poor and hired peasants. Old Lengzi said to the poor and hired peasants: \"I told you to offer opinions, but you don't dare to offer them, but you get to share the fruits. Do you know where these fruits come from?\" When distributing the fruits, honest farmers are treated like thieves and not allowed into the circle. They say: \"Get out, what if something is missing?\" Last winter, as a reward for activists, thirty-two people distributed fruits at night. The masses watched from the cracks in the door as the cadres carried flour jars home. Corruption is also very common. First, the fruits are taken to the cooperative, and after a few days, they end up in their own homes. The political director said: \"At the meeting in the district, I was determined not to be corrupt, but when I see things, I want them and always find a way to get them.\" The deputy village chief already has a house but still wants to exchange it for a better one. Ma Shan's mother's house is small and leaky, and there is no way to live in it when it rains. Last year, she spent 30,000 Jichaos to buy a house but has not moved in yet. But generally speaking, compared with nearby villages, the conflict between cadres and the masses is not acute. There are the following problems that need to be solved between farmers:\n    1. Thinking of moving the middle peasants: Since \"squeezing feudalism\" last summer, the idea of cutting leeks has been quite common. After the promulgation of the Land Law Outline, the middle peasants also had the fear of \"disrupting and dividing equally.\" After a lot of publicity and explanation, there is still doubt, because there are no landlords and rich peasants to fight in this village, and there are no definite wealthy middle peasants to mobilize, and there is not much \"fat\" to extract from nearby villages. Some middle peasants with land above the average are afraid and are slow to send manure.\n    2. Sectarian problems: Hedong Village has the so-called distinction between \"inside the gate\" and \"outside the gate.\" \"Inside the gate\" was originally one big family, now divided into more than a dozen households, most of whom farm and do carpentry. The masses \"outside the gate\" believe that they have a sect, \"sharp heads,\" and the work is not easy to do; while they believe that the \"outside the gate\" is squeezing them out and dare not speak at meetings.\n    3. Some poor and hired peasants (about 20 percent of the village population) have not yet turned themselves around economically and are still debt-ridden households, but there is no way to make this happen. (The cadres occupy a very small amount, and the undistributed fruits are not many). It is still a problem that needs to be solved.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 河东地少窟窿户多  四分之一农民缺地　代表穷村典型可供各地研究\n\n1948-02-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　河东地少窟窿户多\n    四分之一农民缺地\n  　代表穷村典型可供各地研究\n    【本报消息】河东村是武安九区有名的穷村庄，灾荒年（三十一年）前，全村约五百人，一百二十余户，土地十二顷左右，每人约合二——二·五亩。当时全村约百分之八十是无地或少地的农民，这些农民的出路是给附近村庄的地主住长工、打短工，拾砍、做木工，也有跑关东的，大部分农民都负着债。河东村只有四户土地较多，但他们的极盛时代四家合计不过三百亩土地。经过双减即削弱了一部分，五四指示后，这四户中土地最多的不过五十亩，少的不足四十亩。靠这四户满足全村无地少地农民的要求是不可能的。造成地少民贫的原因，除了本村富农的剥削外，主要是附近各村（河西、石洞、田二庄）地主的地租债利的盘剥，使该村农民无法抬头，有些土地的也被抵押剥夺掉了。灾荒年除“四大家”以外，几乎是家家无口粮，人人饿肚皮。逃荒在外的约占村民十分之一。失散、饿死人口很多。贫农孟月魁全家六口，只剩了父子二人，增生全家四口饿死了一半。“要不是八路军在这里，这个灾荒年河东就全完了”，“八路军通过敌人封锁给老百姓运救济粮”，河东的群众总是念念不忘。但是这些救济粮并未完全落到群众肚里，一部分干部互相救济了。贫农孟兆顺偷吃了合作社十七颗（一说是两把）黑豆子，被扣了三天，空着肚子，只有老婆给送点开水，结果出了三亩地偿了“罚款”了事。\n    灾荒年前后，附近各村地主逃避负担，地价大跌，双减后，河东村买进了相当数目的土地（以石洞村为最多）。另外县府拨给了没收汉奸的公地约四十亩，累年增加，到现在为止，土地已由原十二顷左右增至十七顷七十余亩（人口大体未动，户数由于分住的结果，增到了一百五十二户）。因之群众生活、阶级关系就起了很大的变化，从第五闾二十六户来看：四○——四二年，每人平均土地不过二·○六亩；经过双减，四三年每人平均二·七○亩；五四指示后，上升为每人平均土地三·四四亩。土地虽然增加，但贫雇农民的生活仍然很苦，五闾二十六户中，有五户土地绝对不够，占百分之二十弱。三户粮食困难，占百分之十三。十五户全无牲畜或牲畜不能用，占百分之五十七·七弱。土地最少的每人合二·一六亩，最多的四·一六亩。（三闾悬殊较大，地最少的二·○八亩，最多的六·一九亩）。此外房屋农具一般都很缺，有些没房的贫雇还未分到住房。孟宪多老两口小两口和一个孩子合住一个屋，合睡一个炕。许多房屋一下雨就无处容身。\n    村里主要掌政的没有一个贫雇，村长、武委会主任、财粮主任、民事主任、合作社正副经理、优抗主任等都是多年的村干部老中农，分配果实与分派负担时干部多从自己利益上考虑，土地不是分配，而是标价出售或进行抽换，贫雇买不起，好地、近地大都落在干部手中。剩下或换出的沙卜滩地、远地、碎地再“填窟窿”。“拥护”给赤贫李小林的亩半地有十五、六块，还批评他懒，为啥不愿种。浮财果实的分配次序是抗属荣退军人，干部积极分子，最后的残余才轮到贫雇，麦保老婆五千元买个破缸抬到家不能用，牛保老头子分到个女人褂子。全村二十四户抗属，大部分是中农或新中农，分果实外加三分，都成了凸堆户。另一部分浮财不进行分配，入合作社股，及移归村财政，干部出差在此开销。干部与积极分子结成了三十二人的小集团，政治主任说：“我有了这三十二个人，什么工作都可以做下去”。他们看不见群众，群众在会议上不敢发言，怕一语不对，人家就喊口号；怕人家问：“你是个啥思想”？政治主任死了骡子，主要干部开会时觉得应该把合作社的骡子卖给他，决定后布置积极分子，在农会上“民主讨论”一番，群众看见干部发言如出一口气，就不敢吭。干部在贫雇面前摆自己的功劳，老楞子对贫雇说：“叫你提意见不敢提，分果实可有你，你知道这果实是那来的？”分果实时把老实农民当贼看，圈子不准进。说：“出去，少了东西怎么办？”前年冬天奖励积极分子，卅二个人夜间分果实，群众从门缝中看着干部抱着面缸往家走。贪污现象也很普遍，先把果实拿到合作社，过几天就到了自己家里，政治主任说：“在区上开会下决心不贪污，但见东西就想要，总要设法弄到手。”副村长自己有房还要换好房，马山娘的屋子又小又漏，下起雨来无法住，去年花了三万冀钞买了房子至今没住上。但一般的讲，如和附近村作比较，干群对立不算尖锐。农民与农民之间，有以下的问题须要加以解决：\n    一、动中农思想：自去夏“挤封建”后，割韭菜思想相当普遍。土地法大纲公布后，中农又有“打乱平分”的恐惧，经过很多的宣传解释，仍有怀疑，因为本村已无地主富农可斗，又无肯定的富裕中农可动员，附近各村也无很多的“肥”可抽。一部分土地在平均数以上的中农害怕，迟迟不送粪。\n    二、宗派问题：河东村有所谓“大门里”与大门外之分，大门里原是一大家，现分成十几户，大部种地兼木匠。大门外的群众认为他们有宗派，“尖头”，工作不好做；而他们则认为大门外排挤他们，会议上不敢发言。\n    三、一部分贫雇农民（约占全村人口百分之二十），在经济上还未翻身，还是窟窿户，但却没有来路（干部多占数目极小，未分果实亦不多）。还是个需要解决的问题。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Shanghai Dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit government has decided to sell China's inland waterway navigation rights to American imperialism as one of the conditions for U.S. aid to Chiang. The ports to be opened include Nanjing and Hankou. The Shanghai shipping industry has lodged a serious protest, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's move as \"selling out national independence.\" Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, Dong Xian Guang, made a so-called \"denial\" (actually an admission) in Nanjing on the 18th, admitting that the (Chiang Kai-shek) government could \"freely\" open any coastal and inland river port when necessary for foreign ships to load and unload export or import goods. Since the establishment of the Water Transport Brigade in China in the name of the US aid to Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Headquarters by American imperialism the year before last, China's inland waterway navigation rights have in fact been in the hands of American imperialism. The Water Transport Brigade has nearly 300,000 tons of ships in China, freely navigating Chinese ports under the pretext of \"transporting relief supplies.\" The current purpose of American imperialism is to strengthen and expand this right of aggression against China.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: According to a semi-official newspaper in Shanghai on the 9th of this month: \"From March 1st, Taiwan will restrict travel to and from the island. Passengers traveling to Taiwan from Shanghai, Fuzhou, or other places will be required to fill out forms and submit photos for approval by the military police.\" This is one of the open steps taken by Chiang Kai-shek after signing a secret agreement to sell Taiwan to American imperialism, determined to make Taiwan special. The newspaper revealed that the implementation of this passport system, which is only used between countries, is under the pretext of \"Sino-American (Chiang Kai-shek) cooperation in the development of Taiwan\" and the \"construction of a national defense blockade line\" in Taiwan.

One unit identified the following shortcomings in technical training: (1) Superficiality; whoever shouts loudly, gets up early, and takes off their clothes to train is considered good, or haggling over whether you have progressed a few meters or my movements are more skilled, while neglecting basic issues such as grenade throwing techniques, resulting in formalism. (2) Only the duty platoon leader provides training, and the company-level cadres do not participate, so the training organization remains the same as before. (3) Poor methods; grenade throwing only seeks distance, not technique; bayonet practice only focuses on movements, not aiming at the target; shooting only achieves aiming from a support, neglecting the mental actions of raising the gun and gripping it. After inspection, the unit has gradually corrected these issues. One unit, in its training, called for the idea of thoroughly and completely eliminating the enemy to be implemented in learning, educating soldiers to actively deploy our firepower or change formations under enemy fire, cultivating the idea of resolutely and tenaciously suppressing the enemy.

On the 26th, more than 100 people from the diehard bandit Cheng Daozeng's unit and the puppet Baibi Township Office went to the Jiacun area to loot grain. Upon receiving the information, the Dazhai joint defense militia of our Fifth District and the guerrilla unit group of the Fourth District immediately launched a counterattack against the enemy, immediately occupying Niujiaying, and then rushing towards Jiacun, repelling the puppet bandits and wounding five enemies. On the same day, our Third District guerrilla unit was active in Liucun when the enemy sent a farmer from the XX village to investigate our situation. Unwilling to serve the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and harm his own people, he reported the enemy's situation to us, stating that the diehard bandits were conscripting soldiers and looting grain in the village. We immediately took the opportunity to rush up, causing the enemy to flee westward, liberating nine young people who had been seized by the enemy in Sizhuang. On the 27th, the diehard bandit Cheng Daozeng and Wang Ziquan's units, combined with a company from Chiang's 40th Division, totaling more than 300 people, launched a two-pronged attack to loot grain. The militia of our Fifth District, in coordination with a unit of our troops, drove the enemy all the way to Xiaobeiguan. When they reached the west of Gangshang Village, they were again swept by machine guns and rifles by the Dazhai joint defense militia active in Jiacun, immediately killing six enemies and wounding five. On the same day, our Third District guerrilla unit divided into three groups and were active in Suntaoji, Doufuying, and Lianzhuang, discovering that more than 30 enemy plainclothes were looting grain and conscripting soldiers in Gaojia Village, and even using machine guns to strafe the masses fleeing east. Our guerrilla unit immediately surrounded the enemy in the village, launching a three-pronged attack, killing and wounding three enemies, and annihilating the fleeing enemy in a panic to the west. They fled to Changxiang Village, thinking they had escaped to a safe zone and were safe and sound, and were preparing to rest, eat, and demand money when the guerrilla unit active in Lianzhuang received information from the masses and immediately rushed over, wounding one enemy, and the rest fled in a hurry. They fled to Dongliyuan and were looting grain and demanding money when our guerrilla unit also chased after them, defeating the enemy again. The masses in the village all came out to welcome our guerrilla unit, and complained, \"The enemy demands 150,000 yuan per mu, and if you can't pay, you can't get by. You've driven away the starving ghosts!\" On the 28th, the militia of the Chengdou, Dazhai, and Zungui joint defenses of the Fifth District heroically repelled the incursions of Chiang's 40th Division and the puppet Wang Ziquan's units, totaling two to three hundred people, who were looting grain, chasing them all the way to Xiaobeiguan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邺县武工队　主动出击英勇护粮\n\n1948-02-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邺县武工队\n  　主动出击英勇护粮\n    【太行消息：】邺县武工队、民兵上月下旬，在敌我交接地区密切结合群众，主动展开反抢夺斗争，粉碎了蒋顽伪匪数次出犯。廿六日，顽匪程道增部和伪白壁乡公所共百余人，到贾村一带抢粮。我五区大寨联防民兵，四区武工队小组得息后，即联合向敌反扑，当即占领了牛家营，接着向贾村冲去，击退伪匪，打伤敌五人。同日，我三区武工队活动到刘村，敌人派××庄一个农民来探我情况，他不愿替蒋匪服务害自家人，反向我报告了敌情，顽匪正在该村抓丁抢粮；我当即乘机猛冲上去，打的敌向西逃窜，解放司庄被敌抢抓的九个青年。二十七日，顽匪程道增、王自全两部结合蒋四十师一个连共三百余人，分两路出犯抢粮。我五区民兵配合部队一部一直将敌赶至小北关；赶到岗上村西时，又被我在贾村活动的大寨联防民兵，集中机步枪向敌扫射，当即打死敌六名，打伤敌五名。同日，我三区武工队分三路到孙陶集、豆腐营、连庄活动，发现敌便衣三十余在高家村抢粮抓丁，并连用机枪扫射东逃之群众，我武工队当即包围该村之敌，分三路夹攻，毙伤敌三名，歼敌狼狈西窜，窜到常巷村，以为已逃出安全地带，平安无事，正准备休息吃饭要款，在连庄活动的武工队接到群众送的情报，马上冲去，打伤敌一名，其余慌忙逃窜；逃到东黎园正抢粮要款，我武工队亦随后追去，把敌人再次击溃。该村群众都出来欢迎我武工队，并纷纷诉苦说：“敌人每亩地要派十五万元款，要交不出来，就不能过去，正逼的俺们没有办法，你们把饿死鬼打跑啦！”又二十八日，五区程夺、大寨、遵贵三个联防的民兵，英勇的击退了蒋匪的四十师、伪王自全部二三百人的出犯抢粮、一股劲追到小北关。"

It expressed its heartfelt congratulations to the units for their glorious victory in annihilating the enemy's 54th Provisional Division in Liaoyang and then annihilating the enemy's 25th Division in Anshan in continuous battles. It also encouraged the units to continue annihilating the enemy and strive for greater victories.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, February 23rd】 A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in the battle to capture Zhangwu, adopted the method of collective brainstorming before the battle, combined with repeated exercises, and created a model for siege warfare. Many soldiers in this unit were very excited when the siege mission was about to be issued and were eager to act immediately. In response to this situation, the leadership promptly proposed: \"Whoever comes up with the best method will be given the main task this time.\" This transformed the soldiers' eagerness to fight into pre-battle preparation work. At that time, each squad and platoon immediately started discussions and worked out many specific methods for bridge-building, blasting, and bunker-busting, fully utilizing the collective wisdom and creativity of the soldiers. The unit's cadres focused on studying the enemy's situation and terrain, personally went to the enemy's outer strongholds that had recently been captured by our forces for on-the-spot inspections, and inquired with prisoners about the enemy's deep fortifications and the deployment of troops and firepower. After repeated investigations and studies, each company conducted detailed organizational division of labor, and each combat team further conducted thorough discussions, repeated four or five group exercises, and joint large-scale exercises. During the exercises, some errors were corrected until everyone's actions were completely proficient. As soon as the general attack order was issued, the entire force quickly entered the battle. Two squads passed through a 50-meter assault path in five minutes, blasted the deer antlers, and completed the bridge and ladder construction tasks. A certain platoon broke into the city in fifteen minutes, defeated the enemy's counterattack, and occupied the forward position, allowing subsequent troops to smoothly advance into the depths.

    "content": "Determined to Remold Ourselves Among the Masses\n  　Glimpses of Experience of Comrades from Central Government Cultural Work After Going to the Countryside\n    [Dispatch from this newspaper] After rectifying their ranks, a portion of cultural work comrades from the central government cultural departments who went to the countryside have, from their initial contact with the lives of the masses, begun to understand how the masses are educating them. They are also realizing how ignorant they were of the lives of the peasants in the past. A young comrade from the New China News Agency General Branch, who came from a landlord family, was previously a young work comrade who paid attention to neat clothes and loved beauty. In Party life, his class boundaries were consistently blurred, and he was disciplined at the Party rectification meeting. However, he regarded his punishment as the Party's education for him and accepted it happily. This time when he went to the countryside, he exchanged his original clean cotton clothes for the cook's cotton clothes in the office. In the past, he loved to eat and drink well, but this time in the countryside, he lived with a poor single farmer, eating the same cornbread mixed with bean dregs as him, without feeling it was bitter. In his work, he sincerely accepted the masses' suspicion and scrutiny of him. Initially, the poor farmer asked him about his family background, and he told him the truth, also saying that he had made mistakes. Later, the farmers suspected him of working for bad cadres. Once, when he returned from the cooperative, the poor farmer Ying Huiniang asked him, \"What did you say to the village cadres? What did the cadres say to you?\" At first, he felt a headache over these things, feeling that since he came to serve the farmers and was very sincere, they should not suspect him. But later he thought it through, he realized that he had just begun to betray his class, and accepting the masses' test was entirely necessary. His determination to overcome all difficulties became even greater. He went to visit a poor farmer, who did not like to answer the questions he raised, so he personally went with him to the mountains to chop firewood and do work for him. Finally, this poor farmer voluntarily told him his innermost thoughts.\n    A comrade who had worked in local areas during the War of Resistance against Japan and then worked in the newspaper, he had a relatively good understanding of the lives of the masses in the past, but this time in the common life with the poor peasants, because he himself did not have enough to eat, he began to experience that the lives of the poor peasants are often in a state of semi-starvation. In the winter school, his criticisms of some wrong opinions did not work, but when the masses rose up, their criticisms were much more powerful.\n    In addition, there are some comrades who are newly arrived from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and some who have stayed in the liberated areas for a period of time, but do not understand the countryside at all. But they do not lose confidence because of this and are very enthusiastic. In terms of life, they used to be afraid of lice, but now they are not afraid. One comrade heard someone say that livestock should also be allocated a share of land for eating fodder, and felt that it made sense, but thought that since the Land Law Outline did not have this provision, it should be clarified. So he asked a middle peasant, who told him that good livestock can still earn grain by cultivating land for others and does not need to be allocated land. They felt very happy to accept such knowledge. Their enthusiasm and confidence in serving the masses are gradually increasing with their new mass life and experience.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 决心在群众中改造　中直文化工作同志下乡后的点滴体验\n\n1948-02-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　决心在群众中改造\n  　中直文化工作同志下乡后的点滴体验\n    【本报消息】经过整顿队伍，中直文化部门下了乡的一部分文化工作同志，从开始接触群众生活中，他们初步体会到群众如何在教育着自己，同时也考虑出自己，过去对农民生活是十分无知的。地主出身的新华总分社一个青年同志，过去他是一个讲究衣服整洁，爱漂亮的青年工作同志，在党的生活中一贯的阶级界限不分，整党会上，曾受到处分。但他对自己的处分认为是党对自己的教育，很愉快的接受了。他这次下乡，用自己原来的干净棉衣，换了机关里伙夫的棉衣。过去他是很爱吃喝的，但这次下乡，同一个光棍贫农住在一起，同他吃一样的渗了豆腐渣的杂面窝窝头，不以为苦。工作中他诚恳的接受了群众对他的怀疑与考查。起初贫农问他家庭成份，他据实告诉了，而且说自己还犯了错误。后来农民又怀疑他给坏干部们办事，有一次，他去了合作社回来，贫农英会娘问他：“你给村干部讲了什么？干部又给你讲了什么？”他起初对这些事情感到头痛，觉得自己既来为农民服务，而且又是心很诚，他们不应怀疑。但后来他想通了，他认识到自己才开始叛变阶级，接受群众的考验，是完全必要的。打破一切困难的决心更大了，他去访问一个贫农，他不爱回答他所提的问题，便亲与他到山上打柴、给他做活，终于这个贫农自动对他说了知心话。\n    抗战时期作过地方工作，以后才作报社工作的一个同志，他过去还是比较了解群众生活的，但这次在与贫雇的共同生活中，由于他自己吃不饱饭，才开始体验到贫雇的生活是经常处于半饥饿状态的。在冬学里，自己对一些错误意见批评，没有起了作用，但当群众起来之后，他们的批评就有力得多。\n    此外，还有一部分同志是新从蒋区来的，还有的是虽在解放区呆了一个时期，但根本不懂得农村。但他们并不因此而失掉信心，热情很高。从生活上讲，过去还怕过虱子，现在不怕了。一位同志听有人说，牲口吃草料，亦应分一份土地，心里觉得有道理，但觉得既然土地法大纲上没有这规定，就应弄清楚，于是请教了一个中农，他才告诉他，好牲口还能给别人耕地赚粮食，不需要分地。他们对于接受这样的知识，感到十分愉快。他们对于新的群众生活与体验，逐渐增强着他们为群众服务的热情与信心。"

    "content": "My name is Zhang Xianzi, and I am forty-four years old this year. My man is called Zhang Gan Gui, and the neighbors all call me Gan Gui's Wife. We are poor, and in the past, the village cadres looked down on us. If I offered an opinion or said something, some cadres would say I was making trouble and being disruptive, so I didn't dare say anything. Speaking of dividing the fruits [of land reform], I got forty or fifty shares (in three rounds). To be fair, the land allocated to me was not little (ten mu or so), and half a donkey, but the tools allocated were mostly broken. My family's foundation is empty, and now I still live in my own small, dilapidated house. There's still nothing in my home.\n\nI have been liberated and finally have some good times. My man lived as a long-term hired laborer his whole life. He said he wanted to come back and enjoy his own life, but alas! Who knew he would die of illness the year he came back. I feel sad. My man suffered for over fifty years without enjoying any good times. Speaking of my suffering, there is also a lot to tell.\n\nMy maiden name is Li, and I am from a village in eastern Wu'an. When I was little, my family had ten mu or so of land and seven or eight people. If my dad worked hard, the family could barely make a living. But my dad was not upright, indulging in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. He first sold the land and then the house, selling off all the family's possessions. When I was ten years old, my mother died of anger, my dad drove out my brother, and sold me to a wealthy man named Xu Shan, who had over three qing of land, to be a maid. He sold me for forty silver dollars. After I went to the wealthy man's house, there was so much suffering! The wealthy man's daughter ate special meals, while I ate radish strips and dried bean pods. The wealthy man's daughter wore silk and fancy cloth clothes, while I wore the wealthy man's daughter's discarded rags. The wealthy man's daughter sat on the kang and ordered me around: \"Bring the chopsticks, make some food.\" I stood on the ground serving people. Every day I had to get up early without washing my face or combing my hair to sweep the floor, wipe the table, empty the chamber pot, make the bed… If my dad and brother came to see me, the wealthy man's wife would say: \"If they come, I have to give them travel money. They come every few days. How much money do I have to give?\" After saying this, she would make a fuss (give me a hard time). Her face was not a face, and her nose was not a nose. I felt sad and cried several times. Later I told my brother: \"Every time you come, the wealthy man gives me a hard time. I can't stand it here. In the future, I will live and die in this house. Just consider that you don't have me as a sister!\" From then on, my brother never came again. I missed home and wanted to go back and see. The wealthy man said he had bought me and wouldn't let me go back. Alas, I have a hard life (tears welling up in her eyes). I can't see my relatives, and I can't go back home!\n\nWhen I was little, I wore broken shoes and socks. When it was cold, my feet were cold, but the wealthy man didn't care about me. If I knew how to make them, I wore them. If I didn't know how, I didn't wear them. When I grew to fifteen or sixteen and knew how to do needlework, I didn't make anything for myself. The wealthy man piled all the work of clothes and socks for his whole family on me. Sometimes, I felt sad and said: \"If my dad hadn't sold me, why would I be serving people?\" When the wealthy man heard it, he would scold: \"You stupid bean! Your dad sold you, and I spent money for the purpose of you serving me.\" If I felt unwell, I would cry for a while. The wealthy man would say: \"It's a perfectly good time, why are you crying? You're just a spoilsport.\"\n\nI was in the wealthy man's house for twelve years, and the wealthy man was mean to me for twelve years. When the wealthy man's daughter got married, she wore silk and satin, all red and flowery. When I got married, I thought I had suffered for him for twelve years, and he should give me something, even if it was just a little. I asked for two new clothes, but the wealthy man lied and didn't give them to me. I was so sad that I cried. The wealthy man said: \"What are you crying about? Huh, you want those clothes, but do you have the figure to wear them?\" Alas, the wealthy man is so cruel! Why couldn't I bear his treatment? He ordered me around, and I served him. He had money, and I was poor. I thought about it, and it was all because of the wives, nephews, and wealthy men who exploited us.\n\nMy man was also a long-term hired laborer in his family. Usually, he didn't treat me as his family member. When we got married, he still used me to exploit my man, demanding 160 silver dollars from my man. My man gave him 140 silver dollars, which was not enough. The wealthy man demanded that my man work as a long-term laborer for a year to make up for it.\n\nSpeaking of my in-laws' family, the times were not good either. My man started herding cattle for the wealthy man when he was twelve or thirteen years old, and at fourteen he started working as a young long-term laborer for the wealthy man. Afterwards he was always a long-term laborer. Before the family divided, we mostly ate bran flour and vegetables. After the family divided, we got a mu or so of land. My man worked as a long-term laborer outside, and I spun thread and did odd jobs for the wealthy man at home, and I couldn't even take care of the family. Later, our family went to Xu Shan, to the house of the wealthy man where I had been a maid, to rent land to farm. We lived in his house, and the grain we harvested was divided four-six. Carrying coal to sell was also divided four-six. My grain had to be stored in his house as well. The wealthy man put my grain in his house, and my family didn't have enough to eat. The wealthy man said I didn't know how to manage my affairs, that I was extravagant. One year, I harvested cotton. During the New Year, I wanted to sell some cotton to buy some oil and salt to eat. The wealthy man said I used too much oil and salt. Alas, other wealthy men poured large jars of oil into their homes and it was nothing, but we two saw no end to the wealthy man's exploitation. This bottomless pit was hard to fill, so we decided not to farm his land anymore. When settling accounts, the wealthy man took all the grain and still said it wasn't enough. The wealthy man said my family owed him more than 300 yuan for bedding money. In reality, I only owed him about 110 yuan, but who knew that the wealthy man's interest would snowball, and in three years it would grow to more than 300 yuan.\n\nWhen I returned to Hexi, I still suffered. My man was still working as a long-term laborer outside, and after I finished the work in my own fields at home, I worked short-term jobs for the wealthy men, harvesting millet, picking corn, and picking cotton. I left before dawn and only returned in the pitch black. At home, I was a woman, but in the fields, I was a long-term laborer. I suffered a lot of anger from the wealthy men doing this work. I was harvesting millet at the house of Old Wanzi (one of the biggest landlords in Hexi), and my child came to find me. The wealthy man said: \"Hey, tell her child to leave. Her child will eat my family's food.\" I was picking cotton at the house of Da Bao Cheng (a wealthy man), and after picking six or seven jin, he used a large scale to deduct the weight, and it became four or five jin. After picking the cotton, the women had to carry it back, which was so heavy that we were sore all over. We would walk for a while and then rest for a while. The neighbors saw it and said why the women were carrying it. The wealthy man said: \"If she doesn't carry it, what is she doing?\" I picked up some cotton bolls in the field, and the wealthy man poured them into his field for his sheep to eat. My child picked up firewood, and before he even reached the edge of the wealthy man's garden, the wealthy man said: \"Don't come here, you'll ruin my garden.\" One day, I was returning from picking wheat in the stone cave with my child. My child was thirsty and wanted to drink water. I told my child to go to the embankment under Lao Ruizi's house to drink a mouthful of water. Before my child could drink, the wealthy man scolded: \"Who told you to come here to drink water? Is this water for you to drink?\" He slapped my child to the ground under the embankment, and a red lump appeared on his head. When we poor people go to the wealthy man's fields to pick up some wheat, the wealthy man uses a sickle to chop it. One time, I picked up a pile of wheat in someone else's field all morning and came to Er Bao Cheng's field. He took away all the wheat I had picked up, saying that it was picked up in his field. I picked up a piece of corn, and when I walked to the edge of the wealthy man's field, the wealthy man put my basket in his cloth bag. As soon as I walked to the edge of the wealthy man's field, the wealthy man told me to leave quickly, fearing that I would take his things. Another time, I picked up a small radish in a wealthy man's field. The wealthy man didn't let me pick it up, saying that if he gave it to his sheep to eat, he could still eat meat, but if I ate it, it would be of no use.\n\nDuring the famine years (1932), we ate sesame cakes and tree-top vegetables (elm leaves, willow leaves). I got up early in the morning while the wealthy man was still lying on the kang. I quietly went to the wealthy man's house to get some elm leaves to eat. When the wealthy man found out, he didn't let me climb the tree, saying that I would break his branches. He then trimmed the tree bare, telling me that I couldn't climb it in the future. The wealthy man wouldn't even let me eat tree leaves! My family had nothing to eat. My plump child was so hungry that he was nothing. I sent one of my sons to a trafficker in Zhao Village and sold him for sixty yuan. When the people came to take my child, I bought two sesame cakes to coax my child to leave. My poor child didn't want to leave. I thought: if he doesn't leave, both children will starve to death. If one leaves, both can live. I steeled my heart, gritted my teeth, and hit my child twice. Only then did my child leave crying. I always think about my child. When I lie down at night, I imagine my child is here, but then I look and he's not there. Thinking about it made me fall seriously ill. Now, I don't even know where my child is (she cried)?\n\nDuring the famine years, I still had to beg for food for two years. I went to the wealthy man's house in the village. The wealthy man slammed the door shut, not even giving me a mouthful of water. I didn't dare beg in my own village anymore. I led my children to Stone Cave, Hedong, Qingyan Temple, Shili Dian, and Yetao, begging for a little to eat, and if I couldn't get any, I would come back and nibble on some sesame cakes and drink some water. Alas, talking about this makes me feel sad. I have suffered enough.\n\n(Written by Wu Fang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 受尽了地主的折磨　武安河西村甘贵嫂的一生苦事\n\n1948-02-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　受尽了地主的折磨\n  　武安河西村甘贵嫂的一生苦事\n    俺名是张闲子，今年四十四岁，俺男人叫张甘贵，邻家都叫俺甘贵嫂。俺人穷，过去村上干部瞧不上咱，俺要是提个意见说个话，有些干部就说是捣乱破坏，俺不敢说啥。说分果实吧，俺有四五十分（三回），俺讲良心，分给俺的地可不算少（十来亩）还有半个驴，但分的家伙都是破烂的多。俺家底儿空，现在俺还住着自己的一间小破屋，俺家里还是没任啥。\n    俺翻身了，刚有了时光，俺男人在外住了一辈子长工，说回来过过自己的时光，唉！那知回来后年时病死了。俺心里难受，俺男人苦了五十多年，没享到一点时光，谈起俺的苦，也有一大堆。\n    俺娘家姓李，武安东乡人。小时，俺娘家有个十来亩地，七、八口人，俺爹要是勤受，家里生活也能糊过，但俺爹不正派，吃喝嫖赌又不受，先卖地后卖房，把个家当卖的光大光。俺十岁上俺娘气死了，俺爹撵出俺哥，把俺就卖给徐山一个三顷多地的财主家做使女，把俺卖了四十块现洋。俺去到财主家，苦处可就多啦！财主闺女吃的小灶饭，俺吃的是萝卜条子干豆荚；财主闺女穿的绸的花布好衣裳，俺穿的是财主闺女不要了的破烂衫；财主闺女坐在炕上使唤咱：“筷子拿来，做点饭”，俺是站在地上侍候人；天天早起脸不洗，头不梳就扫地、抹桌子、端尿盆、铺床叠被、端碗拿筷………。要是俺爹和俺哥来看咱，财主老婆就说：“来了要给盘缠，不隔几天就来，有多少钱给呢”？说完了还要出故事（给不好脸看）。脸不是脸，鼻子不是鼻子，俺心里难受，哭了几大场。后来俺跟俺哥说：“你来一回，财主就跟俺出一回故事，俺看不住这，以后俺活在人家活，死也在人家死，家里就顶没俺这个人吧！”从此俺哥就再也没来了。俺想家，想回去看看，财主又说俺卖给他了不叫回。唉，俺命苦呀（眼泪流在眼边），亲人来看不叫看，俺想回去不叫回！\n    俺小，脚上穿的破鞋袜，天冷了，俺脚冷，财主也不管咱，俺会做就穿，不会做就不穿。俺长到十五六岁会做营生（针线活），俺给自己做的没任啥，财主就把他一家子的衣服袜子活堆到俺身上。有时，俺心眼难受，俺说：“不是俺爹卖了咱，俺为啥侍候人。”财主听见了就骂：“死豆子，你爹卖了你，俺花了钱，为的就是侍候俺。”俺要不舒服了，哭一阵，财主就说：“格正正的时光，哭啥，就你败兴。”\n    俺在财主家十二年，财主就刻薄了咱十二年。财主闺女娶时，绸的缎的红花花，俺娶时，心想俺给他受了十二年，好赖该给点，俺要两件新衣裳，财主谎着不给，俺难过的哭起来，财主说：“哭啥，哼，你要那个衣裳，有没有那个衣裳架？”唉，财主刻薄人这样狠！为啥俺受他不动，人家使唤咱，俺侍候他，人家有钱俺穷苦，俺想了想，还不都是妻侄财主剥削的咱。\n    俺男人也是他家一个长工。平时不把俺当着他家人看，娶时还用俺来剥削俺的男人，要俺男人给他一百六十块现洋，俺男人给了一百四十块现洋，不够数，财主就要俺男人抵了一年长工。\n    说起俺婆家，时光也不好，俺男人十二、三岁就给财主家放牛，十四岁给财主家当小长工，以后就一直住长工。没分家时，俺吃糠面和菜的时候多。分了家，分了亩把地，俺男人在外住长工，俺在家给财主纺线做活还顾不住家。后来俺一家就到徐山俺做使女的那家财主租地种，俺住在他家，打的粮食四六分，驮煤卖煤也四六分，俺的粮食也要放在他家。财主把俺粮食往他家里放，俺家不够吃，财主反说俺不会过时光，俺手大。一年俺收了花，过年了，俺想卖点花买些油盐吃，财主就说俺油盐吃的费了。唉，人家财主大罐子油往家打就没啥，俺俩看财主的剥削没个完，这个底子难填满，就决心不种他家地了。算帐时，财主把粮食全收了还说不够他，财主说俺家欠了他的铺垫钱三百多，实际俺欠的只有百十块，那知财主利滚利，三年就涨到三百多。\n    俺回河西还是受，俺男人还在外打长工，俺在家把自己地里活经由完了，给财主打短工，割谷子、撇玉茭、摘棉花，天不明就走，黑洞洞才回。在家我是个娘们，在地里就是个长工。俺做这活也受了好多财主的气。俺给老万子家（河西大地主之一）割谷，俺孩来找，财主说：“嘿，叫她孩子走吧，叫她孩子吃了俺家饭了。”俺给大宝成家（财主）摘花，摘了六七斤，他用大秤一扣，成了四五斤。摘了花还要俺妇女背回来，把俺压得酸溜溜，走一会歇一会，邻家看见了说为啥叫妇女背，财主说：“她不背做啥。”俺在地里拾些花桃子，财主给倒到他地里给他羊吃。俺孩拾柴火，没走到财主的园边，财主就说：“不要来，给俺园子糟了。”一天俺带着孩子从石洞拾麦子回来，俺孩干渴要喝水，俺叫孩子去老瑞子家堰底下喝口水，俺孩还没喝，财主就骂：“谁叫你来喝水，俺这水叫你喝的呢。”一耳光把俺孩子摔到堰底下，头上碰了个红疙瘩。俺穷人去财主地里拾点麦子，财主就用链砍。一回，俺一上午在别家地里拾了一圪堆麦子来到二宝成地里，人家把俺拾的全收走了，说拾的是他家地里的。俺拾个玉茭，走到财主地边，财主就把俺篮子装在他的布袋里了。俺一走到财主地边，财主就叫快走，怕拿了他的东西。又一回，俺在一家财主地里拾个小萝卜，财主不叫拾说给他羊吃了还能吃肉，给俺吃了没啥用。\n    赖年景（三十二年）俺吃的麻饼，树头菜（榆叶、杨叶）。俺清早起来，财主还躺在炕上，俺悄悄上财主家榆树弄点榆叶吃，财主知道了不叫俺上树说压坏了他的树枝，随即把树刨的光溜溜，叫俺以后不能上。财主连树叶也不给俺吃！俺家没啥吃，俺骨碌碌（胖）孩子饿得不成啥样，把俺一个小子送给赵庄人贩子卖了六十块钱。人家来领俺孩，俺买了两个烧饼哄俺孩走，可怜俺孩不愿走，俺想：不走两个孩子都会饿死，走了一个，两个都能活，俺心肝一狠，咬咬牙，打了俺孩两棒棒，俺孩才哭着走了。俺一直想着俺孩，夜里躺时，俺想着俺孩在跟前，一看，又没有，想得俺生了一场恶病。如今，俺孩也不知在那儿（她哭了）？\n    赖年景，俺还要过二年饭，俺去村上上街财主家，财主就把门哗啦插上了，连一口水都不给俺，俺不敢在自己村要了，引着孩子跑石洞、河东、青烟寺、十里店、冶陶，要一点吃一点，要不到回来就啃些麻饼喝口水。唉，说到这，俺心里难受，俺受的苦也够了。　　　　　　　\n　　　　　　（吴舫代笔）"

    "content": "Yan'nan Village Breaks Old Habits\n  　Production Starts on the Third Day of the New Year\n    [Neiqiu News] Yan'nan Village Chief Fang Zhenkui and Political Director Huo Laicheng convened a production committee on the second day of the Lunar New Year to discuss when to start production this year. The majority of cadres suggested starting production on the third day. Wu Weihui Director Liu Lianxi said: This is good, but we need to let the masses study it carefully. From the third to the fifteenth day, because the ground has not yet thawed, we will focus on collecting firewood. Overcome the old thinking of \"sitting on the seventeenth and fearing the eighteenth.\" The meeting also reviewed the textile work. The achievements of the hundred-day textile campaign last winter were not significant. This year, cadres should take the lead, form core groups, and lead general groups. On the evening of the second day, a mass meeting was held, attended by more than seventy men and women. The village chief first mobilized everyone, saying that this year our district is a disaster area, and the food is relatively good during the first month of the New Year, so we must produce well. In the past, \"sitting on the seventeenth and fearing the eighteenth\" had many disadvantages. Let's discuss when we should start production this year and what we should do. Fang Qinggong, who is in his fifties, said: I say we should start production tomorrow because the spring is short this year, and the Awakening of Insects is on the twenty-fifth. After the Awakening of Insects, the ground will thaw, and it will be time for major production. Now we should collect firewood and fertilizer. As the saying goes, \"What you do in your spare time will save you work when you're busy.\" If there is more firewood, we won't have to worry about fuel for planting and will be able to concentrate on production. The old sayings of the past should be overthrown. Liu Cun (a peasant who has been emancipated) said: We should break old habits. In the old society, we worked for the landlords. Now we are working for ourselves, and the sooner the better. The masses all said: What those two said is right. Song Jinsheng added: Our village has twenty or thirty laborers, and one day of rest is equal to twenty or thirty workdays. How much less work will we do if we rest for half a month? If we collect firewood, we will cut three or four hundred bundles less. In the end, everyone agreed to start the next day. The women also agreed to textile production. At the meeting, it was decided that men should cut one bundle of firewood per day, and women should spin one pound of yarn every five days, depending on the speed of spinning. On the third day, after eating breakfast, the village chief and political director shouted and urged everyone to go to the eastern mountain to collect firewood. The masses in the whole village also mobilized on the third day. Of the twenty-eight full and semi-laborers in the village, nineteen went to the eastern mountain, and the remaining eight or nine (semi-auxiliary laborers) also went to nearby places to cut firewood. Statistics for the day showed a total of twenty-five or six bundles of firewood were cut. The masses all said: This is very good. Sitting is sitting, and cutting one bundle is one bundle, which is better than staying at home.\n　　(Yan'nan Correspondent Group)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 岩南村打破旧习惯　正月初三开始生产\n\n1948-02-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　岩南村打破旧习惯\n  　正月初三开始生产\n    【内邱消息】岩南村长房振魁，政治主任霍来成，在大年初二召开生产委员会，研究今年啥时生产。大多数干部意见，初三就开始生产。武委会主任刘连喜说：这样好是好，可得好好叫群众研究研究。初三到十五日，因地还没消冻，突击打柴。克服过去的坐十七、骇十八的旧思想。会上对纺织工作也作了检讨。去冬百日纺织成绩不大，今年要干部带头，成立核心组，带领起一般的组。初二晚上便召开群众大会，到会的男女有七十多人。首由村长动员大家，他说，今年咱区是灾荒区，在正月饭食也比较好，咱们要好好生产。过去“坐十七骇十八”，有好多害处，大家讨论讨论，咱们今年啥时开始生产，都干些啥。五十多岁的房庆公说：叫我说明天就开始生产，今年春短，二十五就惊蛰，惊蛰后地就消了，就该大生产了，现在应该打柴集肥。常说“闲时做的忙时活”，柴火多了，养种地不愁烧，就能安心生产，过去的旧说法应该打倒。刘存（翻身户）说：应该打破旧习惯，旧社会给地主受，现在是给咱做的，越早越好。群众都说：人家二人说的对。宋金生又说：咱村二三十个劳力，歇一天就是二三十个工。歇半月就少做多少活？要打柴就少割三四百担。最后大家赞成第二天下手。妇女纺织也同意了。会上决定男人每天割一担柴火，妇女按纺的快慢，一般的每五天纺一斤线。初三那天，吃了早饭，村长政治主任连喊带叫的上了东山打柴。全村群众初三也都动起来了。全村整半劳力二十八人，上东山的就有十九个，其余的八、九人（半辅劳力）也都去近地方割柴了。一天统计，共割柴二十五六担。群众都说：这样很好，坐着也是坐着，割一担是一担，总比在家强。　\n　（岩南通讯组）"

    "author": "Jin Yan",

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【Qinyuan News】 Jiao Jinrong, a standing committee member of the Qinyuan County Branch of the Trade Union, colluded with trade union cadres in Xiaxingju Village to manipulate the village's old coal kilns and monopolize coal prices, causing losses to workers in newly opened kilns. Xiaxingju Village in the third district of Qinyuan County has three coal kilns, one of which is larger in scale and has better quality coal. County Trade Union Standing Committee member Jiao Jinrong, village trade union chairman Qin Rongsheng, and several other village cadres all have shares in it. Qin Rongsheng is the kiln's accountant and is essentially the person in charge of this kiln. This kiln is close to the main road and has many customers, so business is booming. It is said that each person can earn a gross profit of one dou of millet per day. Another kiln was newly opened by Qin Genyou, Jiao Tufu, Wang Huer, and other six mutual aid group members. Because this kiln is newly built, the coal is not as good, and the road is not smooth. Coal carts always have to pass by the old kiln first. The new kiln has virtually no business, and the coal produced cannot be sold.\n    The new kiln officially started work on October 12th of the lunar calendar (road construction in the kiln began in September). Each of the six people paid two dou of millet and two jin of sesame oil as advances. After a month of labor, they burned 30,000 jin of lump coal, which could not be sold. Trade Union Standing Committee member Jiao Jinrong told them, \"No one is allowed to sell it cheaply, the price must be unified, and no one is allowed to call for carts from outside. Whoever sells cheaply or calls for carts deserves to be beaten to death.\" Because the coal from the new kiln was not as good, it could not be sold at the same price (two sheng of millet per tuo). The hired poor workers had to comply, but with 30,000 jin of lump coal unsold, the two dou of millet were eaten, and the two jin of oil were used up, so they had to stop work immediately. So they went to Jiao Jinrong and Qin Rongsheng to discuss. Jiao said, \"Save up one or two hundred thousand jin first.\" But these hired poor workers were struggling to earn a living, where would they get so much capital to save up one or two hundred thousand jin of lump coal before selling it? Because the coal could not be sold and they could not buy oil and rice, they could not continue to work, so the workers often went to the trade union to ask to sell some lump coal to the hospital. The cadres not only did not agree to their request, but Jiao Jinrong also angrily said, \"Don't even think about the hospital's business.\" The hired poor workers were very discouraged. Should they give up? Then this new kiln would not be built. Should they continue? They couldn't work on an empty stomach! They couldn't work without oil for lamps! So they went to the chairman of the Joint Association, Qin Xuanwen, but he didn't give them a clear answer. They went several times, and he always vaguely promised to solve the problem, but it dragged on for more than a month. The workers sometimes worked, sometimes stopped, and sometimes worked for a morning and drank a bowl of thin porridge, which was very uncomfortable. Village head Dou Guangxi and Farmers' Association Chairman Qin Genshuan were a little anxious. Later, although the Joint Association tried to find some solutions, it always could not pass through the trade union, and the hired poor workers were not very satisfied. Finally, the hospital convened a meeting with the village head, the Joint Association, the trade union (Qin Rongsheng), the Farmers' Association (Qin Genshuan), and the heads of the two kilns to study the matter, and it was decided that the hired poor kiln would sell 30,000 jin of lump coal to the hospital and borrow 60,000 yuan in silver dollars in advance to buy oil and rice to continue working. Recently, they produced some more coal, which still could not be sold, but they did not dare to mention it to the trade union, so they had to go out and find the recuperation company and sell 30,000 jin of lump coal and 150 tuo of black coal. Jiao Jinrong still said behind their backs, \"They have no organization and are too proud!\"\n    The hired poor workers said, \"Because it is a newly built kiln, it took a lot of time to repair the road (the road in the kiln) and to pass the ridge (the big stone ridge in the kiln must be passed before there is coal). Because we could not sell coal, we lost a month or two. For the three months up to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, those who did well earned 36,000 yuan in silver dollars and nine sheng of millet per person. However, in the three months, each person spent one shi and three dou of millet (equivalent to more than 26,000 yuan), and ten jin of sesame oil (1,200 yuan per jin), equivalent to 12,000 yuan. The above expenditures totaled more than 38,000 yuan. Adding the nine sheng of millet, equivalent to 2,000 yuan. It's just breaking even, but also got a road (the kiln road).\"\n\n　　　　　　　(Jin Yan)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沁源下兴居村工会干部　操纵旧窑垄断煤价  新窑窑工吃了大亏\n金焰\n1948-02-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沁源下兴居村工会干部\n  　操纵旧窑垄断煤价  新窑窑工吃了大亏\n    【沁源消息】沁源县支工会常委焦金荣，结合下兴居村工会干部，操纵该村旧煤窑，并垄断煤价，迫使新开窑的窑工吃了亏。沁源三区下兴居村共有三坐煤窑，其中一坐规模较大，炭亦较好，是一坐老窑。县支工会常委焦金荣，村工会主席秦荣生，还有其它几个村干部，都有股金。秦荣生是窑上的会计，实际上成了这坐窑的负责人。此窑离大路近，顾主多，所以买卖兴隆，据说每天每人可得毛利小米一斗。另一坐窑是雇贫互助组秦根有、焦土福、王虎儿等六人新开的窑，这坐窑因是新建设，炭不算好，路亦不顺，拉炭车总得先路过那坐老窑。新窑上简直就没生意，出来的炭无法出售。\n    新窑阳历十月十二日正式开工（九月间就开始修窑里的路），六个人每人支垫出小米二斗，麻油二斤。劳动一个月，烧出了三万斤兰炭，无法出售。支工会常委焦金荣告给他们说：“不准贱卖一斤，价钱要统一，不准出外边叫车，谁贱卖，谁叫车，打死亦活该。”新窑的炭不好，一样价（二升小米一驼）就卖不出去。雇贫工人们只好遵命，可是三万斤兰炭卖不出去，二斗小米吃完了，二斤油点完了，马上就得停工。于是便找焦金荣、秦荣生商量。焦说：“你存下个一二十万斤再说。”可是这些雇贫工人们指苦求财，从哪里有那么大的抵垫（资本），让存个一二十万斤兰炭再说呢？炭卖不了，买不回油和米，便无法继续劳动下去，所以工人们经常去找工会要求卖给医院一部分兰炭。干部不仅没答应他们的要求，而且焦金荣还生气的说：“医院的买卖你们就不要想。”雇贫工人非常泄气，放下不干吧？这坐新窑便建设不成。继续干吧？不能饿着肚子干呀！没油点亦不行呀！便找到联会主席秦宣文，但亦没说了个长短。连找几次，总是似是而非答应解决，就这样拖了一个多月。工人们有时劳动，有时停止，有时劳动一上午，喝一顿稀饭，真难受极了。村长豆光玺、农会主席秦根拴，都有些着急，以后联会虽给想些办法，可是总通不过工会，雇贫工人亦不很满意。最后还是由医院召集村长、联会、工会（秦荣生）、农会（秦根拴），和两个窑上的负责人开会研究，才算决定由雇贫窑上卖给医院三万斤兰炭，预借给雇贫大洋六万元，以便买油买米继续劳动下去。最近他们又出了些炭，还是无法出售，但又不敢向工会提，只好出去找到休养连，卖了三万斤兰炭，一百五十驼黑炭。焦金荣还在背后说他们：“没有组织，有自高性哩！”\n    雇贫工人们这样说：“由于是新建设窑，修路（窑里的路），过棱（窑里的大石棱过去才有炭），浪费很多时间，卖不了炭误了个把月，到正月十五整三个月，做的好每人分大洋三万六千元，九升小米。可是三个月每人支垫小米一石三斗（折洋二万六千多），麻油十斤（每斤一千二百元）折洋一万二千元，以上共开支大洋三万八千余元。加上九升小米，折洋二千元。恰恰不亏但也不赚，不过就是赶了个嘴，赚了一条路（窑路）。\n　　　　　　　（金焰）"

    "content": "Actively Preparing for Spring Plowing\n　　Huguan Farmers Work Hard to Deliver Manure\n　　[Huguan News] This spring's work is particularly heavy, as we must both equally distribute land and seize the time to plant early. Many villagers in Huguan are taking advantage of the absence of cadres who are away for study to deliver manure in large quantities. Villagers in Shuzhang Village, Sixth District, began as early as the second day of the Lunar New Year, and have already delivered more than 3,500 loads of manure to the fields in five days. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, when repairing the manure delivery road, the people of Guojia Tuo Village in the Fourth District discussed while repairing the road: How will we wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year tomorrow? Cui Xinglong said: Let's wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year with production and frugality. Cui Liuzhi said: I guarantee to get everyone up early tomorrow to deliver manure. Our Guojia Tuo will wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year with increased production and manure delivery. On the second day of the Lunar New Year, before the rooster crowed, Cui Juhe called up forty-two people, and while carrying manure, shouted: Get up quickly and deliver manure! One hundred and twenty-nine people, fifteen ox carts, delivered a total of nine hundred and eighty-five loads of fertilizer in one morning. After breakfast, everyone hung up a portrait of Chairman Mao and wished him a Happy New Year. They also proposed: We cannot make empty promises to Chairman Mao. We must resolutely complete the delivery of fertilizer by the tenth day of the Lunar New Year. Wang Lianzhong (poor peasant/hired laborer, veteran), the public security director of Zhuangtou Village in the First District, collected manure from three mu of land last winter. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, when others were busy preparing for the New Year, he still picked up two baskets of manure. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, he picked up another four baskets, and on the second day, he carried manure to the fields. His family has a total of four people, with a fifteen-year-old child and a twelve-year-old child. The two children carried manure together while he carried it himself. By the ninth day of the Lunar New Year, they had carried all two hundred and seventy loads of manure. At the group New Year's gathering in Qinji Zhuang Village, Third District, it was proposed to wish Chairman Mao a Happy New Year with production and frugality. On the morning of the second day, four carts began delivering fertilizer. Guo Xiping, a poor peasant/hired laborer in Beijie, Chengguan, First District, Cheng Haidong, an elderly military dependent over fifty years old, and Liang Jinlian, the village chief of Nanguan Village, all delivered fertilizer to the fields at dawn on the second day of the Lunar New Year. When Long Shaochi in the Fourth District began delivering manure, the people thought that the land had not been equally distributed, and they did not know where to deliver it. After a family meeting of poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants was held on the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, and the Land Law Outline was studied in detail again, especially after repeated explanations were made about the policy towards middle peasants, everyone began to understand. A manure delivery plan was drawn up on the spot, and the delivery began on the second day and was completed by the tenth day. As soon as dawn broke on the second day, Yang Yuesheng and others got up to deliver manure. They all said: In the past, labor was for the landlords! Now it is our own, how can we not work?

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency:\n\n　　The prices of goods and stock prices in the United States have continued to fall this week, continuing a 19-day decline, which shows that \"the American economy has entered a stage of decline, or is approaching a stage of decline\" (TASS). On the 15th, the average index of 35 American commodities had fallen to about 186, a sharp drop of 21 percent from a month ago. By the 20th, \"the wholesale prices of about 900 basic commodities showed the sharpest decline in a year and a half\" (Associated Press). Even American economists have had to admit frankly that \"prices will continue to fall\"! The sharp drop in stocks and securities has made brokers of major American companies anxiously \"pace the floor of the stock exchange.\" The price drops of nearly three weeks have begun to produce serious consequences. On the one hand, due to the disastrous drop in agricultural product prices, the vast number of farmers have increasingly fallen into a miserable state of bankruptcy; farmers in Kansas alone have lost one million U.S. dollars. On the other hand, bankruptcies of factories, enterprises, and stores are increasing. According to a TASS dispatch on the 19th, quoting the U.S. Commerce Daily, \"The number of company bankruptcies last week reached the highest peak since January 19, 1943.\" This serious situation has made American capitalists \"uneasy\" and flustered. Truman's economic advisors are racking their brains to \"draft a plan to deal with the economic crisis that will eventually come\" (U.S. Wall Street Journal). The above facts prove that the storm of the American economic crisis is approaching.\n　　Just before the arrival of this economic crisis storm, American imperialism is trying every possible means to make a dying struggle. On one hand, it is frantically clamoring to rescue the \"Marshall Plan\" and is more frantically implementing plans to aid Greece, Turkey, and Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, it is colluding with the British and French reactionaries to prepare for a unilateral convocation of the Three-Power Conference and the reopening of the Western European Sixteen-Nation Conference in order to further divide Germany and establish a \"Western European Group.\" To cover up this conspiracy, the U.S. imperialists fabricated and published the so-called \"Records of Nazi-Soviet Relations between 1939 and 1941,\" vainly attempting to launch a propaganda offensive to slander the Soviet Union and put a fig leaf on its naked policy of aggression. However, this kind of \"fascist measure\" by U.S. imperialism has aroused unanimous condemnation from the people at home and abroad. The Soviet Information Bureau immediately countered, publishing the important document \"Historical Falsifiers,\" which powerfully hit the vital point of the American, British, and French reactionaries, so that the false anti-Soviet propaganda had to cease. At the same time, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia held a meeting of foreign ministers on the 17th to discuss the general situation in Germany, expressing their intolerance of the attempt by the U.S., Britain, and France to turn Germany into a new hotbed of aggression. The German people have also risen up to oppose the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to divide Germany. At the 7th plenary session of the Central Bureau of the German Socialist Unity Party, the party's vice-chairman, Ulbricht, called on all democratic forces in the country to fight against the \"Marshall Plan\" that would colonize Germany. The twenty-year Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed between the Soviet Union and Hungary on the 18th, and the signing of the trade agreement between the Soviet Union, Belgium and Luxembourg and the upcoming negotiations on the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, have also greatly strengthened the power to \"prevent Germany and any other country united with Germany from re-engaging in aggression,\" and gave the Marshall Plan a powerful blow.\n　　Despite the fact that American imperialism has intensified its suppression of the American people's democratic movement, and has successively and unreasonably arrested Williamson, one of the leaders of the American Communist Party, and Smith, the secretary of the Maritime Union of the CIO, the people's democratic movement has continued to develop rapidly under the attacks of the reactionaries this week. Isaacson, the progressive Labor Party candidate in the United States, won an overwhelming victory in the House of Representatives by-election in the Bronx district of New York State, which is dominated by the Democratic Party. This \"means that the people have rejected the 'Marshall Plan,' anti-labor laws, and anti-communist and anti-people acts, and it also means that the people voted in trust of Wallace and the Third Party.\" The American people's movement against universal military training and protesting against anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-democratic activities is continuing to unfold, which reflects how strong and irresistible the American people's desire for peace and opposition to aggression is.\n　　Another important event of the past week was that the Italian People's Democratic Front won new victories in the struggle against the Gasperi reactionary camp. The results of the election in the city of Pescara on the 17th revealed that the People's Democratic Front had an overwhelming advantage, winning 21 seats in the city council, while the Christian Democratic Party, the Saragat Party, the Republican Party, and other right-wing parties won a total of 19 seats. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti pointed out in a congratulatory message that \"This is a victory for the laws of the Republic over the reactionary and brutal rule of the Christian Democratic Party,\" and this victory symbolizes the bright future of the Italian people in the upcoming general election.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 经济危机风暴快到了  美帝力图作垂死挣扎\n\n1948-02-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　经济危机风暴快到了  美帝力图作垂死挣扎\n    美国的物价和股票价格，本周来仍继续下跌，这继续了十九天的跌风，说明“美国经济已进入衰落阶段，或正迫近衰落阶段”（塔斯社）。十五日，三十五种美国商品的平均指数，已下跌到一八六左右，较一个月前猛跌百分之二十一。到二十日，“九百种左右基本商品的批发价格，呈现了一年半以来最尖锐的下跌记录”（合众社）。甚至连美国的经济学家也不得不坦白地承认，“物价将继续下跌”！股票证券的暴跌，使美国各大公司的经纪人焦急地“在股票交易所的地板上，踱着步子”。将近三周来的跌价，已开始产生了严重的后果。一方面，由于农产品价格的惨跌，广大农民已日益沦于破产的惨境；仅堪萨斯一州的农民，即已损失了一百万美元。另一方面，工厂企业和商店的破产愈见增加，据塔斯社十九日电引证美商务日报说：“上周公司破产的数目，已达到一九四三年一月十九日以来的最高峰”。这种严重局势，使美国大资本家“惴惴不安”和手忙脚乱，杜鲁门的经济顾问正苦思“草拟一个计划，以应付终将到来的经济危机”（美华尔街日报）。上述事实证明了美国经济危机的暴风雨是快到了。\n    就在这经济危机风暴来临的前夕，美帝国主义正千方百计力图作垂死的挣扎。它一面狂吠抢救“马歇尔计划”、并更疯狂地实行援助希、土、蒋的计划，同时又勾结英法反动派，准备片面召开三国会议，和重开西欧十六国会议，以便进一步分裂德国和建立“西欧集团”。为掩饰此种阴谋，美帝竟伪造发表所谓“一九三九年至四一年间纳粹与苏联关系录”，妄图发动一个诬蔑苏联的宣传攻势，为它的赤裸裸的侵略政策挂上一块遮羞布。但是，美帝国主义此种“法西斯措施”，更激起了国内外人民的一致声讨。苏联情报局当即予以反击，发表了“历史伪造者”的重要文件，有力地打中了美英法反动派的要害，以致虚妄的反苏宣传，终不得不偃旗息鼓。与此同时，波、南、捷于十七日召开三国外长会议，讨论了德国的总形势，对美英法变德国为新侵略温床的企图，表示不能容忍。德国人民亦奋起反对美帝分裂德国之阴谋，在德国统社党中央局第七届全会上，该党副主席吴布利希号召集中国内一切民主力量，为反对使德国殖民地化的“马歇尔计划”而斗争。苏联与匈牙利于十八日缔结的二十年友好互助条约，和苏、比、卢贸易协定的签字与即将开始的通商航海条约之谈判，也大大加强了“阻止德国及任何其他联合德国国家再事侵略”的力量，并给了马歇尔计划以有力的打击。\n    尽管美帝国主义加紧镇压美国人民民主运动，又先后无理拘捕美共领袖之一的威廉逊和产联海员工会书记史密斯，但人民民主运动，一周来仍在反动派的进攻下迅速发展。美国进步的劳工党候选人伊萨克逊，在纽约州民主党占优势的波伦特区之众院补缺选举中，取得了压倒的胜利。这“意味着人民摈弃了“马歇尔计划”、反劳工法；和反共反人民的行为，同时也意味着人民投票信任华莱士和第三党”。美国人民反对普遍军训和抗议反苏反共反民主的运动正继续展开，这反映了美国人民热望和平和反对侵略的意志，是如何顽强而不可抗拒。\n    过去一周另一重要事件，便是意大利人民民主阵线在与加斯贝利反动阵营的斗争中，获得了新的战果。贝斯加拉市选十七日揭晓结果，人民民主阵线占压倒优势，荣获市议会议席二十一席，基督教民主党、萨拉盖特党、共和党及其他右派共计占十九席。意共领袖托格里亚蒂于贺电中指出：“这是共和国法律对基督教民主党反动而残酷的统治的胜利”，而这一胜利，正象征着意国人民在未来大选中的光明前途。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）"

    "author": "Zhi'an, Zhenming",

    "content": "Combining Land Law Propaganda\n　Seize the Time to Prepare for Spring Planting\n　Neiqiu County Government Instructs Districts and Villages to Act Immediately\n[Neiqiu News] The Awakening of Insects is approaching, and soon it will be time to cultivate seeds and work the land. This year's spring is short, so we must seize the time for cultivating seeds and preparing the land. Manure should be delivered early, and the land should be harrowed early, otherwise, there will be trouble with cultivating seeds and dividing the land later on. If we encounter a timely rain, production will be delayed. In the past, people would start hauling manure to the fields and harrowing the land right after the fifth day of the first lunar month, but now most of them haven't moved. After inspection and research, it was found that several confused ideas are hindering the spring plowing preparation movement. Some upper-middle peasants have heard that excess land will be taken out, and they are calculating how much will be taken from them and which piece. They are afraid that if they harrow the land or deliver manure to the fields, it will be taken away later. Poor peasants know that they are only relying on the land they will receive, and they are planning to exchange it for better land in the future. They don't want to start early, fearing that the manure will be taken away during the exchange. Cadres who have been overturned too much are also afraid that the manure will be taken away when land is redistributed. The reason for these phenomena is mainly that the propaganda of the Land Law is not in-depth enough, and they have not truly grasped the spirit of the Land Law. The county leadership has issued an urgent instruction to all districts and villages to combine the study and propaganda of the Land Law Outline, continue production, and seize the time to carry out spring plowing preparation work:\n\n　　(1) Thoroughly Implement the Study and Propaganda of the Land Law Outline\n　District and village schools should start classes earlier and adhere to the study system. All important documents related to the Land Law should be discussed after being read and explained, and questions should be raised for everyone to discuss. Poor and hired peasants should become the backbone of the Land Law propaganda, and the policies on each class, especially the middle peasants, should be explained clearly during the land distribution. In the past, women spent a lot of time on spinning and weaving, so their study of the Land Law Outline was very poor. Some women didn't even know what it was all about, which is a major shortcoming. In the future, it should be combined with spinning and weaving to mobilize study and discussion. In the past, the propaganda of the Land Law was very uneven in various villages. Now, attention should be paid to villages where study is insufficient, and efforts must be made to ensure that every mass studies the Land Law Outline well. In terms of propaganda methods, the use of various market days to organize strong cadres to explain has yielded great results in the past, and this method can continue to be used. New methods should also be created. Those who faithfully abide by and maintain the Land Law Outline, focus on production, and patiently promote and persuade others to implement it should be commended in civil schools, radio stations, and public blackboards. Those who deliberately distort and sabotage, and are stubbornly unrepentant, should be strictly stopped or sent to the government. Do not carry out struggles, beatings, or detentions in the village.\n\n　　(2) Seize the Time, Continue to Intensify Sideline Production, Implement Thrift to Overcome the Famine, and Prepare for Spring Planting.\n　When publicizing the Land Law Outline, explain to the poor and hired peasants that implementing the Land Law is most beneficial to them, and that they will be the leading backbone in the future implementation of the distribution. They should also play a key role in promoting production and unite with the middle peasants to work hard. Explain to the middle peasants that implementing the Land Law is also beneficial to them and that they should focus on production. As long as they thoroughly study the Land Law, they will actively engage in production. For example, in Xiaoxinwang, the middle peasants were very scared in the past. After the old lunar year, the middle and poor peasants united to discuss and study, understood the basic spirit of the Land Law, and after the sixth day of the first lunar month, everyone helped each other, organized more than 20 livestock, and have now completely plowed and harrowed more than 700 mu of spring land. They are still seizing the time for production. This year's spring is short, and the work of cultivating seeds and working the land should start now. Now is a good time, and the sunny slopes have begun to thaw. If we do not seize the time to accumulate manure, deliver manure, and harrow the land, spring planting will be delayed. Sideline production should also be started immediately. Use the profits from the first hundred days of spinning and weaving to mobilize women and immediately restore the past organization and take action. In addition to not delaying spring plowing preparation, men should also be organized in a planned way according to the favorable conditions of each village. It should also be explained to the masses that if production, thrift, and spring plowing preparation work are not done well, the difficulties in life will be aggravated, which will be detrimental to the future land distribution. They should be made aware that the distribution is precisely for the purpose of improving production. The land cultivated on behalf of others should be distributed quickly, as this year's spring is very short and the cultivation of seeds for military families cannot be delayed. The examination and transfer of loans should continue to be carried out in depth. Those who have not transferred should continue to transfer. After the poor and hired peasants receive the loans, efforts should be made to organize them to unite with the middle peasants for production. This year, during the old lunar year, the broad masses of cadres and people accepted the government's instructions before the year, did not buy or sell firecrackers, and rarely bought useless things, and ate less meat, which has saved a lot of money. The spring famine has not yet passed, and the masses should continue to be mobilized to carry forward the past spirit of thrift to overcome the famine, save money and materials, and solve the problem of the spring famine.\n　　　　　　　　(Zhi'an, Zhenming)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 结合宣传土地法　抓紧时间准备春耕　内邱县府指示区村立时进行\n治安　振鸣\n1948-02-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　结合宣传土地法\n  　抓紧时间准备春耕\n  　内邱县府指示区村立时进行\n    【内邱消息】惊蛰将到，很快就要养种园地了。今年春短，闹养种必须抓紧，粪要早送，地要早耙，不然将来要闹养种，又要平分土地，遇见抢晌雨，就要误生产。过去一过正月初五就有人往地里拉粪，打耙地，现在却大部未动。经过检查研究，发现有几种糊涂思想阻碍着春耕准备运动。有些上中农听说要抽出多余部分土地，自己盘算不知道要抽自己多少，和抽那一块，怕打耙了地或把粪送到地里，将来给抽走了。贫农知道自己净赖地，打算将来换些好地，也不想早动手，怕抽换时带走自己的粪。翻身过高的干部，也怕抽肥时带走自己的粪。造成这些现象的原因，主要是对土地法宣传尚不深入，他们还没有真正掌握土地法的精神。县领导上特紧急指示各区村，结合学习宣传土地法大纲，继续生产，抓紧时间进行春耕准备工作：\n    　　　　（一）贯彻深入学习宣传土地法大纲\n    各区村民校要早些开课，坚持学习制度，把有关土地法的一切重要文件，经过读解后，提出问题让大家讨论，要使贫雇成为宣传土地法的骨干，把平分中对各阶级特别是中农政策说明白。妇女过去因纺织占的时间多，对土地法大纲学习的还很差，有的妇女根本还不知道是怎么一会事，这是一个大缺点，今后要和纺织结合，发动学习讨论。过去一段，各村宣传土地法很不平衡，现在要注意学习不够的村庄，一定要作到使每个群众普遍学习好土地法大纲。在宣传方式上，过去一段利用各集市，组织有力干部人员来讲解，收到成绩很大，这一方式还可继续采用。并应创造新的方法方式。对忠诚遵行维护土地法大纲，安心生产，并耐心给别人宣传，劝告别人执行的人。要在民校、广播台、大众黑板上进行表扬。对故意曲解破坏执迷不悟的分子，应严厉制止，或送政府，不要在村里进行斗争吊打扣押。\n    　　　　（二）抓紧时间，继续加紧副业生产，贯彻节约渡荒，准备春耕。\n    宣传土地法大纲时，向贫雇说明执行土地法对贫雇最有利，贫雇是将来执行平分的领导骨干，在生产中也要起骨干推动作用，与中农团结起来努力干，对中农说明执行土地法对他们同样有好处，应该好好安心生产。只要他们对土地法学习通，是会积极起来生产的。如小辛旺过去中农很害怕，经过旧历年后中、贫农团结讨论学习，闹通了土地法的基本精神，初六以后大家就互助起来，组织起二十余头牲口，现已将七百多亩春地完全耕耙了一遍，现仍抓紧生产。今年春短，现在就要开始养种园地，现在有好晌，阳坡地已开始消冻，如不抓紧积肥、送粪、打耙，春地将来就会误种。副业生产也应马上开始活动，拿第一个百日纺织中所得利润来动员妇女，马上恢复过去组织，行动起来。男人除不误春耕准备，也要根据各村有利条件，有计划的组织起来。并要向群众说明：生产节约渡荒和春耕准备工作搞不好，生活上困难加重了，对将来进行平分是不利的，要叫他们知道平分正是为了搞好生产。代耕地应很快的分配，今年春很短，不能误了军属家的养种。查贷转贷要继续深入进行检查，没转的继续转。贫雇得到贷款后，要设法组织他们，团结中农进行生产。今年过旧历年，广大干部群众，已接受了年前政府的指示，没买卖鞭炮，很少买无益无用的东西，少买肉吃，已节约钱不少。春荒仍未过去，仍要动员群众，继续发扬过去节约渡荒的精神，节约财物，解决春荒问题。　　　　　　　　　　　\n　　　　　　　　（治安、振鸣）"

In 1946, the Labor Party only received 27 percent of the vote, while the Democrats received 43 percent. Now the situation has been reversed. Therefore, all American newspapers have had to admit that the Labor Party's victory is clear evidence that the pro-Wallace progressive forces can deliver a serious blow to the Democratic presidential campaign. According to a TASS dispatch on the 19th, Isaacson's victory \"has caused great joy among progressives throughout the United States and great distress among the leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties.\" An afternoon newspaper stated that it poses a serious threat to the Democratic presidential campaign in New York State. Labor Party Chairman Marcantonio said that voters' election of Isaacson shows that they reject the Marshall Plan, oppose high living costs and anti-labor bills, as well as anti-communist and anti-people actions. It also shows that they oppose the reactionary policies of creating war and economic depression, and at the same time, it is equivalent to voting for Wallace and a third party. The Associated Press said that the scale of the Labor Party's victory is particularly surprising to political observers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: New York dispatch: The movement of American people supporting Wallace's election campaign is growing.

According to estimates by American economists, the cost of purchasing major commodities this year will be two billion dollars less than last year. At the same time, the number of canceled equipment orders is increasing. This economic situation has caused panic among Washington politicians. The Wall Street Journal claims that Truman's economic advisors have begun drafting plans to cope with the impending economic crisis.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: New York dispatch: The US Department of Labor's statistics on the wholesale prices of 900 commodities, released on February 20th, show a \"sharp drop in prices\" (Associated Press report). The department's figure for the week ending February 14th (with 1926 as 100) was 151.7, while the previous week it was 163.8, and the post-war peak reached 165.5. The Department of Labor claims that the biggest drop was in agricultural product prices. It is reported that grain prices in Chicago and other places broke the two-day calm on the 20th and became unstable again, and on the 21st, they experienced a \"general plunge,\" with stocks also falling at the same time. According to economic statistics from various New York newspapers, economic activity is confirmed to be declining. Railway freight volume for the week ending February 14th was 1.8 percent lower than the previous week and 8.2 percent lower than the same period last year. Coal production so far this year is eight million tons lower than the same period last year, and commercial and agricultural loans from New York banks decreased again by $75 million last week.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美物价暴跌进入第三周　经济活动日渐缩小\n\n1948-02-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美物价暴跌进入第三周\n  　经济活动日渐缩小\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：美国物价之跌落已进入第三周，美大多数报纸都承认：即使“最高明的专家”，也被这种混乱的经济情况弄得糊涂不堪了。“美国新闻”杂志称：最近的行情，表示经济已走到下坡路。“商业周刊”、“商务日报”号召美国资本家们应予以极大注意。许多报纸都强调物价暴跌后果的严重性质。商务日报说：即使目前的大跌价，只是初步的震动，但亦将大大影响商业。证券市场不断委结的象征之一，便是上周凯萨与佛拉萨大汽车公司不得不将发行的新股票收回五十万美元。美国制造商对于大量出售主要商品的希望，已很渺茫。据美国经济学家的估计，今年购买主要商品的费用，将比去年少二十亿美元。同时，取消装备定货的数目日益增加。这种经济局势，使华府政界人士惊惶万状。华尔街日报称：杜鲁门的一批经济顾问已开始草拟计划，以应付终将到来的经济危机。\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】纽约讯：美劳工部二十日公布的九百种商品批发价格的统计，显示出“物价的尖锐下跌”（合众社讯）。该部截至十四日为止一周之数（以一九二六年为一百）为一五一点七，前一周则为一六三点八，战后最高峰达一六五点五。劳工部声称：此次暴跌以农产品跌价最大。据悉，芝加哥等地粮价二十日打破两日来的平静又告不稳，二十一日并“普遍暴跌”，股票亦同时跌落。另据纽约各报的经济统计，证实经济活动日渐低落。铁路运货量至十四日为止的一周内，较前周低百分之一点八，较去年同期低百分之八点二。今年迄今的煤产较去年同期低八百万吨，纽约上周各银行的工商农业贷款，再度减少七千五百万元。"

The agreement stipulates the quantity and type of goods to be exchanged between the two parties in the next two years, and its scale is the largest ever between the Soviet Union and Western European continental countries.

However, it was formally signed due to the people's insistence and the exposure of reactionary conspiracies by public opinion.

After meeting with Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Molotov, Deputy Chairman and Foreign Minister, they signed the Soviet-Hungarian Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in the Kremlin on the 18th. The treaty was signed by Molotov on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and by Dinnyés on behalf of the Hungarian President. Stalin, Voroshilov, Tildy, and Veres (Hungarian Minister of Defense) all personally attended the ceremony. The main contents of the treaty are:\n\n    I. The contracting parties guarantee to eliminate the threat of renewed aggression by Germany or any country allied with Germany in any way.\n\n    II. If one of the contracting parties is at war with Germany, or with any country that jointly with Germany engages in aggression in Europe attempting to restore its policy of aggression, or any country that is allied with Germany in any form to carry out a policy of aggression, the other contracting party shall immediately provide military and all other assistance.\n\n    III.

We, the Soviet people, believe that this is a major achievement in implementing Stalin's foreign policy aimed at strengthening friendship with neighboring countries and consolidating universal peace. Molotov pointed out: \"The signing of the Soviet-Hungarian treaty is of extremely great significance for guaranteeing peace and security in Europe. According to the lessons of the Second World War, it is necessary to help peace-loving countries in Europe to prevent Germany or any country adopting a common policy of aggression with Germany from engaging in aggression again.\" Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés also made a speech, pointing out: \"This treaty will guarantee our country's freedom and independence. We understand that imperialists do not want peace-loving and free people to have independence and unity. They hope to rule the world, and their main principle is to conquer other nations through war. This is the reason why our country and its neighboring countries have recently signed mutual assistance treaties. We must frankly admit that not long ago, there was still a danger in Hungary. That is, foreign imperialist elements colluding with domestic reactionaries in Hungary attempted to turn Hungary into a powerful base for anti-Soviet and anti-democratic activities.

The Czech and Polish peoples, having personally experienced the tragedy of being sold out and subjugated, find their memories particularly painful. The Czech newspaper *Pravo Lidu* stated: \"This document ruthlessly exposes the behind-the-scenes political trickery of international imperialists, of which Czechoslovakia was the first victim. Now, the Sudetenland fascists, who have been expelled from Czech territory and are employed by the British, American, and French occupation authorities, are again shouting 'March on Czechoslovakia!'\" Polish Foreign Ministry Press Director Groz, in a press conference answering questions from American reporters, solemnly stated that the Polish government fully agrees with the Soviet government's assertion that Western countries incited Germany to launch a war against the Soviet Union; and emphatically stated: \"The story of the Munich conspiracy is already well known to all.\" The Romanian newspaper *Liberation* stated that this document \"not only proves the truth of history but also disarms the warmongers of their poisonous weapons.\" *Timpul* pointed out: \"Peace-loving countries have learned a lesson from the tragic lessons of history, and they will unite more closely under the threat of imperialism, and no one will be deceived again.\" The French Communist Party Political Bureau also expressed satisfaction with this statement on the 20th, believing that the Soviet statement \"has given important support to the forces of peace.\" The French newspaper *L'Humanité* wrote: \"Not only Hitler, but also those who gave birth to him, nurtured him, and encouraged him, such as the American warmonger Dulles, must be held responsible for the Second World War.\" In the United States, the *Daily Worker* pointed out: \"The fact that Western countries refused the Soviet request to jointly publish Nazi documents tells us that Western countries are trying to poison the atmosphere that the Soviet Union is currently striving to clarify.\" The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association also issued a lengthy statement condemning the State Department's anti-Soviet document as \"greatly damaging the people's hopes for peace.\" The liberal afternoon newspaper and the *Chicago Sun* also criticized the State Department for \"distorting and falsifying history.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: Comprehensive report: The U.S. State Department, with the unanimous consent of the British and French governments, published the so-called \"Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939-1941\" on January 21st, attempting to slander the Soviet Union and launch an anti-Soviet propaganda offensive. However, since the Soviet Information Bureau has issued a series of \"Falsifiers of History\" statements in recent days, according to TASS, it has caused the US and British officials to \"fall into obvious confusion\"; causing this anti-Soviet propaganda offensive to suffer a setback. After the Soviet statement was published, a British Foreign Office spokesperson immediately denied at a press conference that the British government had agreed to the so-called \"German-Soviet documents\" published by the U.S. State Department. But when others reminded him that Bevin had already acknowledged in his response to Churchill's speech in Parliament on the 4th of this month that the United States had obtained British consent, the spokesperson was embarrassed and had to apologize to everyone.

They have successively petitioned Chairman Mao and Deputy Commander Peng, requesting an early order to advance into the KMT-controlled areas to liberate the people of the Great Northwest. A directly subordinate unit recently held a mobilization rally for advancing into the KMT-controlled areas. All commanders and fighters enthusiastically reported their plans for earning merit and held a solemn oath-taking ceremony. A certain squad of another unit, at the unit's \"Speak Bitterness, Seek Revenge, Volunteer to Kill the Enemy\" meeting, read aloud the entire squad's resolution, led by the squad leader and deputy squad leader:\n\n　　\"We are all determined to eradicate selfish desires. We will shed blood and sacrifice for the people, unite to make revolution.\n\n　　We request the superiors to issue orders, the sooner the departure, the better. We wholeheartedly advance to kill Chiang's bandits, so the poor in the Chiang area can stand up.\"\n\n　　The Eighth Company of a certain unit wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: \"In our company, twenty people have begged for food in the past, eleven families have starved to death, twenty-six have fled from disaster, nine have been forced to sell their children, seven mothers have remarried due to poverty, and thirty-one have been captured by Chiang's bandits to serve as soldiers. Today, after the \"Three Check-Ups\" and military training, everyone unanimously demands to fight out, avenge ourselves, and liberate the compatriots in the KMT-controlled areas. Beloved Chairman Mao, please issue the order quickly! We will definitely complete the task resolutely.\" On the eighth of this month, all the commanders and fighters of the Fourth Company of another unit held a public memorial meeting to commemorate the family members of the soldiers who were persecuted by Chiang's bandits and landlords, and the martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause. The memorial altar was adorned with simple and powerful elegiac couplets: \"Rest in peace, comrades who sacrificed themselves for the poor to stand up! We will resolutely inherit your legacy and will not rest until we eliminate the Chiang bandits.\" \"Grievances have their source, debts have their debtor, rest assured, parents who died under oppression! We have already taken up arms, and we will not rest until we avenge our grievances.\" The soldiers painfully denounced the darkness of Chiang's bandit rule in their writings and indignantly swore before the altar to avenge the dead, demanding that their superiors quickly issue orders to fight into the KMT-controlled areas, eliminate the traitorous Chiang Hu, and liberate the people who have not yet stood up. During the advance discussions in various units, the soldiers earnestly proposed that discipline and unity should be strengthened when fighting in the KMT-controlled areas. The Twelfth Company of a certain unit mentioned in a letter to Chairman Mao about the seven major guarantees to be implemented after going out, especially emphasizing the resolute protection of industry, commerce, and public buildings in the new areas.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北解放军各部上书毛主席  请求早日进军蒋管区  消灭蒋匪解放大西北\n\n1948-02-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北解放军各部上书毛主席\n    请求早日进军蒋管区  消灭蒋匪解放大西北\n    【新华社西北二十三日电】西北人民解放军经过两个多月的三查和练兵后，阶级觉悟普遍提高，士气高涨，纷纷上书毛主席和彭副总司令，请求早日下令向蒋管区进军，解放大西北人民。某部直属队日前召开进军蒋管区的誓师大会，全体指战员兴奋热烈的报告各人立功计划，并举行严肃的宣誓。另部某班在该部诉苦复仇请缨杀敌大会上，由正副班长率领宣读全班决心书：\n    “我们人人下决心，自己私利都去尽。流血牺牲为百姓，团结起来闹革命。\n    要求上级下命令，出发最好在最近。一心上前杀蒋匪，蒋区穷人好翻身”。\n    某部八连在给毛主席的信上写着：“我们连里过去有二十人讨过饭吃，家里饿死人的有十一个，逃过难的有二十六个，逼卖儿女的有九个，为穷苦所迫母亲改嫁的有七个，被蒋匪抓去当兵的有三十一个，今天我们经过三查和练兵后，大家都一致要求打出去，替自己报仇，解放蒋管区的同胞。敬爱的毛主席，请你赶快下命令吧！我们一定坚决完成任务”。另部四连全体指战员本月八日举行公祭大会，公祭被蒋匪及地主迫害的战士家属和为革命事业忠勇牺牲的烈士们，灵台上贴着简朴有力的挽联：“为穷人闹翻身牺牲的同志们安息吧！我们坚决继承你们遗志，不消灭蒋贼心不死。”“冤有主债有头，屈磨死的爹娘们放心吧！枪杆子咱们已经拿到手，不报冤仇誓不休”。战士们在书上沉痛的控诉了蒋匪统治的黑暗，并在灵前激愤的宣誓为死者伸冤报仇，要求上级赶快下命令打到蒋管区去，消灭蒋胡卖国贼，早日解放尚未翻身的人民。各部队在进军的讨论中，战士们认真的提出到蒋管区作战应加强纪律和团结。某部十二连给毛主席的信中提到出去的七大保证中，特别说明坚决保护新区的工商业和公共建筑物。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Shanghai late dispatch: The All-China Students' Federation issued a statement on New Year's Day, summarizing the experiences of students in the Chiang-controlled areas in the past year in opposing Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, dictatorship, anti-people civil war, and American imperialist aggression. It emphasized the importance of unity in the patriotic democratic movement and pointed out that students in the Chiang-controlled areas \"must closely unite with the people\" in order to win the victory of China's independence, democracy, and peace. A certain English magazine here recently published the full text of the statement, which is translated as follows:\n\n　　Chinese students have achieved glorious results in 1947.\n\n　　We have fought with unparalleled perseverance and courage against Chinese reactionaries and American imperialism, which supports China's civil war, dictatorship, betrayal of the country, and enslavement. We also fought for the right to study, for democracy, peace, freedom, security, and to win the basic rights of life and democracy that every person in a democratic country possesses. For these, we have paid our blood. Three students of Wuhan University, Yu Ziyu of Zhejiang University, and the chairman of the Wenzhou Student Union have been killed. Many other students have been expelled, brutally tortured, insulted, arrested, imprisoned, or forced to wander the streets.\n\n　　The reactionaries vainly attempt to use civil war and dictatorship to eliminate the increasingly powerful force of the Chinese people, in order to forever oppress and enslave the poor. They shamelessly cooperate with American imperialism to oppose the Chinese people. They oppress and exploit the Chinese people and suppress mass movements. At the same time, they practice censorship in an attempt to cover up their reign of terror and deceive the Chinese and world people. They shattered their own deceptive propaganda by convening a bogus National Assembly, passing a bogus constitution, and announcing a \"general mobilization order\" (such an order was not even issued during the Anti-Japanese War). All these reactionary measures have plunged the Chinese (Chiang-controlled) people into unprecedented suffering of constantly rising prices, bankruptcy of industry, agriculture, and commerce, unemployment, conscription, and heavy taxes.\n\n　　The people have been forced to unite and fight for their survival. One righteous movement after another has erupted in the areas controlled by the reactionaries.\n\n　　We students stand at the forefront of the struggle, becoming the vanguard of the urban people. In January 1947, we launched the movement to protest against the atrocities of the American military. In May, there was the anti-hunger, anti-civil war movement. In the summer, there was the down-to-the-countryside movement. In October, there was the movement to guarantee human rights. In addition to these national political movements, there were also scholarship movements and winter relief movements. These actions have taught us that the only possible strength is our unity. But students cannot solve the problem. We must closely unite with the people.\n\n　　Comrades, let us greet 1948 with greater perseverance and will, continue to fight, and strive for even greater victories than last year.\n\n　　　　　　　　　All-China Students' Federation　　January 1, 1948\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全国学联总结反蒋美经验　必须和人民密切联合\n\n1948-02-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　全国学联总结反蒋美经验\n  　必须和人民密切联合\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】上海迟到消息：全国学生联合会于元旦发表文告，总结去年一年蒋管区学生反对蒋介石卖国、独裁、反人民内战及美帝侵略的斗争经验，强调在爱国民主运动中团结一致的重要性，指出蒋管区学生“必须和人民密切联合起来”，才能争取中国独立、民主、和平的胜利。此间某英文杂志近登该文告全文，兹转译如下：\n    中国学生在一九四七年获得了光荣的成绩。\n    我们以无比的毅力与勇气，对中国反动派及支持中国内战、独裁、卖国和奴役的美国帝国主义进行了斗争。我们也为了读书的权利，为民主、和平，为自由、安全、争取全国人民生活及民主国家每人具有的基本权利而战斗。为了这些，我们已付出我们的鲜血。武大三同学、浙大于子三及温州学联主席已被杀害，还有许多同学被开除、无情拷打、侮辱、逮捕、监禁或被迫流浪街头。\n    反动派妄想以内战和独裁来消灭中国人民日益强大的力量，以便永远压迫与奴役穷人。他们无耻地与美帝合作来反对中国人民，他们压迫与剥削中国人民，压迫群众运动。同时又实行新闻检查，以图掩盖他们的恐怖统治，欺骗中国与全世界人民，他们以召开伪国大，通过伪宪，宣布“总动员令”（对日抗战时期也未颁布过这种命令），粉碎了他们自己的欺骗宣传。这一切反动措施已把中国（蒋区）人民陷于物价不断高涨，工农商业破产、失业、抽丁与荷税的空前苦难中。\n    人民已被迫为其生存而联合起来进行斗争，反动派控制的地区爆发了一次又一次的正义运动。\n    我们学生是站在斗争的前列，成为城市人民的先锋。我们在四七年一月，发动了抗议美军暴行运动，五月有反饥饿反内战运动，夏季有下乡运动，十月有保证人权运动，除了这些全国性的政治运动外，还有助学运动及冬季救济运动。这些行动教训了我们：唯一可能的力量便是我们的团结。但是学生是不能解决问题的，我们必须和人民密切联合起来。\n    同学们，让我们以更大的毅力与意志来迎接一九四八年，继续战斗，争取比去年更大的胜利。\n  　　　　　　　　　中国全国学生联合会　　一九四八年一月一日"

These societies were organized under the direction of Wang Sanzhu, the joint defense commander of Hua (County), Feng (Qiu), and Yan (Jin) counties, and became a tool for Chiang Kai-shek bandits against the people in northern Henan. Our armed forces of the Fourth Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, therefore, completely resolved them at the beginning of the month. Since the majority of the society members were forced or induced by superstition to participate, our army, after liberating them, adhered to the policy of leniency and education. As long as they no longer serve as tools for Chiang Kai-shek bandits against the people, they were released to return home and join the peasants in overturning the old order and distributing land.\n\n[Taihang News] In Yexian and Taigu in Taihang, the local armed forces, combined with a part of the main force, actively intercepted and attacked the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit troops, eliminating over a hundred enemies in two battles and capturing Guanjia Fort. On the 19th of this month, two companies of the pseudo-bandit \"Henan People's Self-Defense Second Detachment\" under Guo Qing, stationed in Tian Lichangtun, Yexian County, advanced towards Dafotun. Our Yexian County battalion bravely met the attack and repelled the enemy after an hour of fierce fighting, eliminating a part of them. A total of 62 enemy soldiers, including company commander Wang Fushou, were captured alive, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and one machine gun, 67 rifles and pistols, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. A part of the main force of the Second Sub-district, on the 11th, our army in Taigu proactively went deep behind enemy lines, attacking Guanjia Fort and Nansha River, five miles south of Taigu City, capturing the Guanjia Fort stronghold in one fell swoop, eliminating 25 Yan Xishan bandits, including 18 captured alive. Five rifles, over forty rounds of ammunition, and four bayonets were seized.\n\n[Taiyue News] The Second Demolition Squad of the First District of Pingyao went deep into the guerrilla areas of Yuanjiazhuang, Xianrenqiao, and other places to carry out demolition guerrilla warfare. On February 1st, the Second Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 44th Division of Yan Xishan bandits stationed in Xier, coordinated with over a hundred members of the pseudo-Piancheng Township team, launched a sudden attack on Yuanjiazhuang. When over twenty people advanced towards our Jiulonggou and passed through Xianrenqiao, the township head of the Yan Xishan bandits was instantly blown to death with a loud bang, four were seriously injured, and one submachine gun and two rifles were damaged. The Yan Xishan bandits were so frightened that they dared not move forward and returned crestfallen.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫四分区地方武装　歼蒋匪会门一千四百  解放人员本宽大教育方针处理\n\n1948-02-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫四分区地方武装\n  　歼蒋匪会门一千四百\n    解放人员本宽大教育方针处理\n    【本报消息】冀鲁豫四分区地方武装，在七日至十日四天中，解决豫北封邱曲河一带蒋匪组织起来的反动会门武装一千四百余人，其中毙伤五○六名，俘九四七名，缴轻机枪三挺，步枪四十九支，短枪五支及缨枪一部。这些会门，是在土蒋滑（县）封（邱）延（津）三县联防指挥官王三祝一手扶植下组织起来，并成为蒋匪在豫北反人民的工具，我冀鲁豫四分区武装，乃于月初将其全部解决。被解放的会门，由于大部是被迫或迷信诱惑参加的，因此我军解放他们后，即一本宽大教育方针，只要他们不再作蒋匪反人民的工具，即释放回家，同农民一道翻身分田。\n    【太行消息】太行邺县、太谷两地，地方武装结合主力一部，积极阻击和出击蒋阎匪军，两仗歼敌百余名，攻克贯家堡。本月十九号，驻在邺县田李常屯的伪匪“河南人民自卫第二总队”郭清部两个连，向我大佛庄进犯，我邺县营兵勇猛迎击，激战一小时，打退了敌人，消灭一部。计活捉敌连长王福寿以下六十二名，打死打伤敌数十名，缴获机枪一挺，长短枪六十七支，子弹一千多发。二分区主力一部。十一日，太谷我军主动深入敌后，进击太谷城南五里的贯家堡和南沙河，一举攻克贯家堡据点，消灭阎匪二十五名，内活捉十八名。缴获步枪五支，子弹四十多发，刺刀四把。\n    【太岳消息】平遥一区爆炸第二小队，深入游击区原家庄、仙人桥等地爆炸游击。二月一日，驻西尔阎匪四四师二团二营配合伪偏城乡队一百多人，突击到原家庄，有二十多人向我九龙沟进犯，经过仙人桥时，轰的一声把阎匪乡队长当场炸死，四个负了重伤，还炸坏了冲锋枪一支，步枪两支。吓的阎匪不敢前进，垂头丧气的跑回去了。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 24th: Following their victory in the anti-\"mopping-up\" operation last month, the local armed forces of Central China advanced into towns occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits in early February, and crushed the local \"mopping-up\" operations of Chiang's bandits against Huaibei, annihilating 1,773 enemies, including 1,223 captured alive, and capturing more than ten strongholds. The details are as follows: From the 1st to the 4th, the local armed forces of the First Military Sub-district launched an offensive against the Jiangyin, Taixing, and Rugao areas along the Yangtze River, capturing Yantou, two miles north of Taixing City, and Xieqiao and Tuqiao, east of Jiangyin, completely annihilating over 620 enemy troops defending the area, and defeating a battalion of enemy reinforcements from Jiangyin City, eliminating more than 50 of them; taking advantage of the victory to liberate Xingang, an important town along the river, they also annihilated a battalion of the 21st Division of Chiang's bandits coming from Shizhuang (an enemy-occupied stronghold) south of Rugao, killing and capturing over 300, including Battalion Commander Huang Guiting. At the same time, the local armed forces of Zishi (a newly established county northwest of Rugao) annihilated two puppet bandit squadrons of Taixing County near Jiangnian. On the night of the 7th, the local armed forces of Dongtai launched a surprise attack on Beiguan Bridge in the suburbs of the city, eliminating over 70 enemy troops. On the night of the 1st, the local armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district captured Beifurong in western Xinghua, completely annihilating over 200 Chiang bandits, including the Third Brigade of the Xinghua Security Forces. The Chiang bandits in the area fled in panic. Six strongholds, including Nanwangzhuang and Zhao Jiazhuang, were immediately recovered by us. The local armed forces of the Sixth Military Sub-district in the Huaibei area successively advanced into Huaiyin, Lianshui, Siyang, Suqian, Muyang, and the south side of the Longhai Railway to eliminate local bandits, eliminating a total of 206 enemy troops. The local armed forces of the Seventh Military Sub-district in Huaibei crushed the \"mopping-up\" operations of four regiments of Chiang's bandits against the central areas of our Sixian, Suqian, and Siyang counties. The local armed forces who persisted in the inner lines killed over 50 enemy troops, including a battalion commander, in Longjietao, Siyang. On the 6th, the outer line local armed forces annihilated the First and Second Brigades of Chiang's bandit police, totaling over 200, at Zhangdalu. The \"mopping-up\" enemy troops fled in a panic towards Xuefeng Town (formerly Bancheng). On the 9th, we again annihilated over 50 enemy troops in the Qiujia area south of Suining. In total, we captured 53 light and heavy machine guns, two 82mm mortars, small cannons, 20 60mm mortars, 39 Thompson and carbine submachine guns, and over 500 long and short rifles.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China Front, February 24th: Around the Spring Festival, the People's Liberation Army carried out in-depth activities in the suburbs of Weihai City, killing or wounding a total of over 80 enemy troops in the areas of Naigu Mountain, Pucuilou, and Gumoling. During the victorious attacks on the enemy, the Disaster Relief Committee of the Weihai Municipal People's Government specially allocated a portion of grain, which was transported by the work team through the artillery fire to relieve the poor people in the suburbs of the city who were suffering under the oppression of Chiang's bandits.\n\nXinhua News Agency, East China, February 24th: Around the Spring Festival, the counties of Penglai, Jidong (east of Jimo), and Weinan (south of Weixian) in Jiaodong launched political offensives against the isolated enemy strongholds and bandits. Party and government personnel and local armed forces in Weinan County inserted themselves into the enemy-occupied areas at night to conduct loudspeaker appeals, write letters, hold puppet family meetings, and write \"admonition strips\" on the doors of puppet family members. This caused the puppet township security teams to flee in droves. In the Songjia Shuangmiao and Guanqiao Chiang-occupied townships, 25 of the township teams had 12 members immediately flee. In Penglai, 41 enemy troops defected to the liberated areas in a matter of days. The Chiang bandits in each city are now extremely panicked, intensifying martial law, not allowing soldiers to go out, and not allowing residents to travel freely.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华中地武挺进蒋占区　九天歼匪一千七百\n\n1948-02-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华中地武挺进蒋占区\n  　九天歼匪一千七百\n    【新华社华东二十四日电】华中地方武装继上月反“扫荡”胜利，本月上旬挺进蒋匪侵占城镇作战，并粉碎蒋匪对淮北的局部“扫荡”，歼敌一千七百七十三名，内生俘一千二百廿三名，克据点十余处。经过如下：一分区地方武装于一日至四日间，向靖江、泰兴、如皋沿江地区发动攻势，克泰兴城北二里之燕头及靖江东之斜桥、土桥，全歼守敌六百二十余名，并击溃靖江城出援敌一个营，歼其五十余名；乘胜解放江边重镇新港，又于如皋南歼灭由石庄（敌重占据点）出犯之蒋匪廿一师一个营，毙俘营长黄桂亭以下三百余名。与此同时，紫石（新设县如皋西北）县地方武装在姜埝附近歼泰县匪伪两个中队。七日夜，东台地方武装突击城郊北关桥，歼敌七十余名。二分区地方武装一日夜攻克兴化西部北芙蓉，全歼蒋匪兴化保三中队等二百余人，该地蒋匪慌忙逃窜。南王庄、赵家庄等六据点当即为我收复。六分区淮海各县地方武装先后挺进淮阴、涟水、泗阳、宿迁、沐阳及陇海路南侧扫荡土杂，共歼敌二百零六名。七分区淮北地方武装粉碎蒋匪四个团对我泗县、宿迁、泗阳等县中心区之“扫荡”。坚持内线之地方武装于泗阳龙界套毙敌营长以下五十余名，六日外线地方武装于张大路歼蒋匪交警一、二大队二百余名，“扫荡”之敌即狼狈向雪枫镇（原半城）方向回窜。九日我又于睢宁南之邱家一带歼敌五十余名。以上共缴获轻重机枪五十三挺、八二迫击炮两门、小炮、六零炮二十门，汤姆、卡宾三十九支，长短枪五百余支。\n    【新华社华东前线二十四日电】解放军春节前后深入威海市郊活动，于奈古山、朴翠楼、古陌岭一带先后共毙伤敌八十余名。在胜利袭敌中，威海市民主政府救灾委员会特拨粮食一部，由武工队冒着炮火，运往救济在蒋匪蹂躏下的市郊贫民。\n    【新华社华东二十四日电】春节前后，胶东蓬莱、即（墨）东、潍（县）南等县向各孤立敌据点匪伪展开政治攻势。潍（县）南党政人员及地方武装夜间插入敌占区，进行喊话、写信、开伪属会及在伪属门上写“劝告条”等活动，使伪乡保队纷纷逃亡，宋家双庙、官乔两个蒋区乡队共有二十五人即逃亡十二人。蓬莱敌数日间即有四十一名投奔解放区，现各城蒋匪都惊慌异常，加紧戒严，不让士兵外出，并不许居民自由通行。"

Joined the Party in April 1946, started working in October 1946, currently the Town Head of Chengguan Town, Lin County.)\n\n　　I am from Chengguan Town, Lin County. In June 1945, I became the chairman of the Peasants' Association. At that time, my family was very poor, and I actively led the struggle in order to get millet to eat. The village chief and the director of the people's education political affairs were landlords. They courted me, and we often ate and drank together, not distinguishing between ourselves, forming factions. We had a conflict with Zhao Mitan, a poor peasant village chief, and this group of us knocked down the old cadres, seizing control of the village.\n\n　　During the land reform movement, I shielded six landlord cadres and Party members. They were not struggled against, but instead received a doubled share of the fruits of the revolution. For example, Li Mingchang, the director of people's education, often ate and drank at restaurants without me having to pay, so I felt I had a good relationship with him. His household received 200,000 yuan worth of fruit, and now has assets of a million yuan. Chen Changhui, the director of political affairs, sold cigarette paper. I smoked his cigarettes without paying, so I shielded him as well. The masses demanded that Li Gengshan, the village chief, be struggled against. He produced 1,700 silver dollars, and I convened a branch meeting, saying that Gengshan was good. He was the village chief and had struggled against landlords before, so let's leave him this stock of silver dollars (the village chief had five brothers). The Party members all agreed. During the general meeting, each member of the Peasants' Association received eleven silver dollars. The remaining 500-plus silver dollars were explained to the masses, saying that Gengshan was a very enlightened village chief. We even sent militiamen to deliver the silver dollars to Li Gengshan. However, I felt very disappointed, having made such a fuss, and only receiving eleven silver dollars. Early the next morning, Ji Gengshan secretly sent me one hundred silver dollars, saying it was to \"support\" me, and my wife accepted it. At the time, I didn't think this was corruption, but that the village chief was \"supporting\" me. Later, Section Chief Zheng from the county government came to Chengguan to mobilize the masses to squeeze out feudalism. The masses discussed that Li Gengshan should be the target of struggle. That night, the militiamen went to seal his door. I was at a meeting in the district office, and when I heard about it, I was afraid. I was afraid that Li Gengshan would reveal that he had given me one hundred silver dollars, and I also felt that I had a good relationship with him. I immediately returned home and discussed with the chairman and vice-chairman of the Peasants' Association, instructing the cadres to say to the masses, \"Li Gengshan should not be confiscated.\" Then, I asked Section Chief Zheng to ask the masses for their opinions on whether he should be struggled against. That's how Section Chief Zheng was tricked, and Li Gengshan's family was shielded from struggle. Afterwards, I was very proud, thinking that any cadre who came to work in Chengguan could not escape my grasp. At the time, I didn't realize that they were all landlords, using me to rule the masses. Instead, I was misled by their petty favors, treating the enemy as my confidant, and completely losing my class stand.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 吃吃喝喝上了当　张三反省包庇地主\n\n1948-02-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　吃吃喝喝上了当\n  　张三反省包庇地主\n    （成份贫民小手工业者裁缝出身，一九四六年四月入党，四六年十月参加工作，现任林县城关镇长。）\n    我是林县城里人，一九四五年六月当了农会主席。当时家里很穷，为了吃小米，就积极起来领导斗争。村长、民教政治主任都是地主，他们拉拢自己，大家经常在一块吃吃喝喝，不分你我，结成宗派和一个贫农村长赵米旦闹矛盾，我们这一伙把老干部打下去，掌握了村中大权。\n    在土改运动中，我包庇了六个地主干部党员，他们没有被斗争，反加倍的分了果实。如民教李明昌，因为经常到饭铺吃喝不用我出钱，就觉得和自己感情很好，他一户得了果实廿万元，现在有百十万财产。政治主任陈昌会，卷纸烟卖，我吸烟不给钱，也就包庇了他。村长李庚山，群众要求斗争，他拿出现洋一千七百元，我就召开支部会，说庚山不错，人家是村长，又斗过地主，他这股的现洋给他留下吧（村长弟兄五个），党员都同意。开大会时，每个农会会员分子十一块现洋，剩下五百多元给群众解释了一下，庚山是村长，很开明，就派民兵给李庚山送去了。不过自己也觉得很败兴，弄了一场，只分到十一块现洋，第二天一早，季庚山偷偷给我送来一百块现洋，说是“拥护”我的老婆收下了。当时我还认为这不算贪污，是村长“拥护”我的。后来县政府郑科长到城关发动群众挤封建，群众讨论出李庚山是斗争对象，黑夜里民兵就去封门，我正在区公所开会，一听说心里就怕，怕斗的李庚山说出给自己一百块现洋，又觉得在一块感情不错，马上回到家里和正副农会主席商量，布置干部在群众中活动说：“李庚山不该没收”，然后又叫郑科长问问群众意见如何，是不是该斗争，就这样郑科长上了当，李庚山家也包庇了，没有斗争。事后还很得意，心想：任何干部到城关工作也都脱不了我的手，当时没有认识到他们都是地主，利用自己统治群众，反被人家小恩小惠迷哄住了，把敌人当成了知己，完全丧失阶级立场。"

    "content": "Self-criticism at the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting\n  　Examining How to Break Through Typical Examples\n    Hu Liansheng\n    (From Yushe, Shanxi, of peasant origin, hired laborer background, joined the Party in November 1939, began working in the district in December 1942, currently serving as Secretary of the Third District Sub-Committee in Anyang.)\n    In February 1944, when I was a Sub-Committee member in the Fourth District of Yushe, Sub-Secretary Chen Ping favored seeing Shi Kuiwen the most because he was eloquent and literate, and looked down on me. I thought honest people didn't get ahead, so I resolved to learn to read; I compiled statistics and made reports, thinking that this would make the higher-ups trust me. In June 1946, I was transferred to Anyang and became the Deputy Secretary of the Sub-Committee. I was determined to perform better so that the higher-ups would promote me to Sub-Committee Secretary. In my work, I adopted the approach of creating typical examples, keeping up with the times, and showing off. During the double reduction [of rent and interest] campaign, I relied on my experience in rent reduction in the old liberated areas and depended on a group of hooligans and daredevils to reduce rents, which resulted in following the middle peasant and bankrupt landlord line (middle peasants earned more from rent, bankrupt landlords had more debts, and the poor and hired peasants didn't benefit). In order to create complete materials, I exaggerated the advantages, saying how enthusiastic the masses were and how deeply I had gone into the grassroots, which is why the masses were mobilized… This false report reached the county, \"People's Voice\" (a small newspaper in Anyang) published it, and the New China Daily also printed it. As a result, I became well-known, and I achieved the goal of becoming the Sub-Committee Secretary. During the great liquidation [land reform], I went to Qingliu Village, wanting to show off in a large village. First, I knocked down the cadres of Liang Village and found a group of ruffians to do the work, showing my concern for the poor. In fact, at that time, I only had a poor person's viewpoint. I thought the people of Anyang were cunning and pragmatic, and the masses wouldn't work without benefit, and cadres wouldn't work hard without rewards. In guiding the movement, I seized this characteristic, using typical examples to promote the general. I used cadres as models of grievance to guide the masses, rewarding the active and promoting the backward, so that the masses could see that active participants could get more things, and everyone would participate. But as a result, the cadres divided up all the good things, and when the masses rose up, there was nothing left to divide. The cadres turned over, but forgot the poor. At the end of the great liquidation, Xijishan in the Second District launched the \"knocking down the running dogs\" campaign. Fearing that I would fall behind the Second District, I also started doing it to keep up with the times. I heard Comrade He Gaoming say: \"You can't enter the front door without knocking down the running dogs.\" I thought that in the past, when beggars went to the landlord's door, they wouldn't get food without first beating the dog. If they were careless, the dog would bite them. So I proposed: \"If you want to turn yourself over completely, you must knock down the running dogs before entering the front door.\" In Xiqingliu Village, the \"knocking down the running dogs\" campaign attacked fifty-five people (poor and hired peasants accounted for fifty-two). Not only did the poor and hired peasants not turn over, but the things they had turned over were also returned, and they even lost their capital. When dividing the fruits, the running dogs could only get half (masses got one dou, running dogs got five sheng), driving the poor and hired peasants far away. Peasants fought peasants, landlords watched the fun, which was the most detached from the masses. When I reported to the county, I only talked about the good aspects and didn't mention the panic and fear of the masses. The county committee, after hearing the typical report, praised me again. In fact, I attacked the poor and hired peasants and deceived the higher-ups. In order to create typical examples and keep up with the times, I created \"rupture-ism\" when working in Dawulijian. I convened meetings of poor and hired peasants, but everyone was afraid and dared not rise up. At that time, I thought: \"Poor and hired peasant backbones, poor and hired peasants dare not.\" I thought the poor and hired peasants were backward and had to be forced to tear off their masks, so I forced the masses to struggle. They were forced to tear their faces with the landlords, and the more they were forced, the more afraid the masses became. This time I realized that I was driven by individualistic thinking of striving for championships in my work, and my style of work was simply to complete the task and to gain the trust of the higher-ups, making false reports and deceiving the higher-ups. I treated the masses as my long-term laborers, telling them to do whatever I said. If they didn't do it, they were \"backward.\" I didn't treat the poor and hired peasants as my class brothers and sisters, go all out to mobilize them, and raise their awareness.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行五地委整党会上的反省　检查如何突破典型\n胡连生\n1948-02-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行五地委整党会上的反省\n  　检查如何突破典型\n    胡连生\n    （山西榆社人，成份贫农，雇工出身，三九年十一月入党，四二年十二月到区工作，现任安阳三区分委书记。）\n    四四年二月，我在榆社四区当分委，分书陈平同志最爱见石魁文，因他能写会说，看不起我。思想老实人吃不开，决心学习识字；统计数目做汇报，觉得这样就能使上级相信。四六年六月，调到安阳，当了分委副书记，我抱着表现好些，叫上级提拔我当分书。工作中是采取搞典型，赶时髦，显示自己。在双减时我是凭着我有老区的减租经验，依靠一批流氓二杆子，敢打敢干的减了租，结果走了中农破落户路线（中农吃租子多，破落户债务多，贫雇群众没有得了利）。为了搞成个完整的材料，扩大优点，说群众如何热烈，我个人是如何深入，群众才发动起来的……，假报告到县里，“人民呼声”（安阳小报）呼出来了，新华日报也照样登出来了。这样一来，我就吃开了。分委书记的目的也达到了。大清算时，我到清流村想在大村露一手，首先把梁村的干部打了下去，找了一伙觅汉来干，表现自己对穷人关心。实际当时也只是有穷人观点，我认为安阳人滑头又是实利主义，群众没利不干，干部不奖不好好的干，我在指导运动时，就抓住了这个特点，用典型推动一般。把干部当做诉苦典型，引导群众，奖励积极，推动落后，使群众看见当积极分子的可以多分东西，都起来干。但结果好东西干部分光了，群众起来也没东西分了。干部翻了身，忘了穷人。大清算的末尾，二区西积善展开了敲狗腿，这时我怕落了二区的后，为了赶时髦也干开了。听何高明同志说：“不敲狗腿不能进大门。”我想从前要讨吃的到了老财门口，不先打狗，要不上饭，一不小心狗要咬。所以我就提出了：“要想翻透身，必须敲了狗腿进大门。”西清流村敲狗腿打击了五十五个人（贫雇占五十二人）。贫雇不仅没有翻了身，翻的东西也倒出来了，不够又赔了老本。分果实狗腿只能分一半（群众分一斗，狗腿分五升），把贫雇都打的远远的。农民斗农民，地主看笑话，这是最脱离群众的事情。往县作报告，我又是光说好，对于群众的恐慌害怕都没有谈。县委听了典型报告，又表扬了一番，实际上打击了贫雇，欺骗了上级。为了创造典型，赶时髦，在大五里涧工作时，创造了“抓破主义”，召集贫雇开会，大家害怕不敢起来，我当时觉得：“贫雇骨干，贫雇不敢”。认为贫雇落后，非逼着撕破脸不行，便强迫群众斗争。硬和地主撕破脸，结果越逼群众越怕。这次我认识了：我在工作中是种个人主义的争锦标思想，作风上是单纯的为了完成任务，为了叫上级信任，做假报告，欺骗上级。对群众认为是我的长工，叫你干啥，你干啥，你不干就是“落后”，没有把贫雇当做自己的阶级弟兄，去好好的发动，提高他们的觉悟。"

In Zhu Kang Village, Third District, the family of Pei Lao Wu had seven members. Last autumn, they harvested six shi of rice, which, along with the wheat harvested in the summer, was all seized by the enemy, and by November they had nothing to eat. This was considered a relatively well-off middle peasant household. In the whole of Zhu Kang Village, which has more than 140 households, 74 households had nothing to eat by last November. They were living on hemp bran cakes, chaff, and corn stalks. According to January statistics, only 20 households could afford to eat the summer harvest. Of the 21 qing of wheat fields in the village, which could produce 700 shi of wheat, the Yan bandits seized more than 400 shi. There are more than 120 villages like this in the second, third, fourth, and fifth districts of Pingyao, with a population of 50,000, accounting for more than one-third of the total population of Pingyao. In January, seven people starved to death in Longzhuang and Guoxiu villages in the Third District; two people starved to death in Nan Yijian in the Second District; and five people starved to death in five villages in the Fourth District. Villager Lei Liangjian, because his grain was looted by the enemy and he had nothing to eat, dug his own grave and died. Li Fugua had nothing to eat and died after drinking apricot kernel water. There are quite a few suicides like this. The masses who fled to Xujiazhuang in our district cried to the democratic government personnel as soon as they saw them, saying: \"If we wait a few more days, more people will flee from our village, and even more people will starve to death.\" Now, in Pingyao, more than 10,000 refugees have fled to our Yuebei region. The Pingyao Military Affairs Committee and the democratic government are now trying to raise grain and bran to provide relief, and are organizing the masses to engage in production, overcome difficulties, and launch struggles against the enemy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平遥阎匪拚命搜刮  五万人民饿着肚子\n\n1948-02-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平遥阎匪拚命搜刮  五万人民饿着肚子\n    【太岳消息】平遥在阎匪惨酷的铡刀政策和奋斗团乡公所抢掠下，造成了大灾荒。三区朱抗村裴老五家有七口人，去年秋天打了六石米，连同夏天收下的麦子，都被敌人抢走了，十一月已没吃的。这还是一户比较好的中农。朱抗全村一百四十多户，去年十一月就有七十四户没吃的。吃麻生饼、糠、玉茭秆过日子。一月统计，只有二十户人家能吃到夏收。该村二十一顷麦地，能产麦子七百石，阎匪就抢了四百多石。象这样的村子，在平遥二、三、四、五区就有一百二十多个，人数有五万人，占平遥全部人口三分之一还多。一月份三区龙庄、郭休等村，饿死七人；二区南依涧饿死二人；四区五村饿死五人。村民雷亮兼因粮食被敌抢光没吃的，自掘坟墓而死了。李伏瓜无吃的，喝上杏仁水死了。象这样自杀的还很不少。逃到我区许家庄的群众，一见民主政府人员就哭着说：“再等几天我村逃出的就更多，饿死的人也要更多。”现在平遥，逃上我岳北来的难民已有一万多人，平遥武委会与民主政府，现在设法募集粮糠救济，并组织群众生产，克服困难，开展对敌斗争。"

    "content": "Recovering Steel Capital Anshan and the Battle of Faku:\n  　We Annihilated a Total of 19,000 Bandits\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th] The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued Operations Communiqué No. 24, announcing the details and preliminary battle results of the Anshan campaign as follows:\n    Our field corps launched a general offensive on Anshan City, the steel center, at 7:25 AM on the 19th. Under the cover of artillery fire, the infantry charged bravely and broke through the enemy's main defense lines in the southeastern suburbs, including Shrine Mountain and Lishan, in just 15 minutes. Another unit of ours also occupied most of the area west of the railway at 9:30 AM and captured the puppet municipal government and the railway station. At this point, the fierce fighting gradually shifted to the struggle for the enemy's main fortified strongholds of reinforced concrete structures in the urban area, such as the steel mill, Dui Lu Mountain, Cuo Pan Street, and the Central Bank. By midnight on the 24th, all these strongholds had fallen into our hands, and the battle came to an end. Our army recovered Anshan County and completely annihilated the entire 25th Division of the defending 52nd Army, as well as the traffic police, mine police, and other units, totaling over 12,000 troops, with not a single enemy escaping, from the enemy division commander and deputy commander down. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows: (1) Annihilated 12,997 enemies, including 2,439 killed or wounded, and 10,558 captured alive. Among the enemy officers above the rank of colonel who have been identified so far are: Hu Jinsheng, commander of the 25th Division of the 52nd Army; Luo Yuheng, deputy division commander; Li Lu, major deputy battalion commander of the field artillery battalion directly under the 52nd Army; Xu Qinzhang, major engineer battalion commander; Jiang Zhiyu, major deputy battalion commander of the 25th Division's transportation battalion; Jiang Dongshan, colonel director of the Anshan City Police Bureau; Mao Tiansuo, colonel commander of the steel company's guard brigade, and many others. Luo Yongnian, mayor of Anshan City, and many others were killed. (2) Captured: 107 cannons of various types, including 5 field guns, 2 mountain guns, 8 anti-tank guns, 4 flat-trajectory guns, 1 infantry gun, 29 mortars, 58 60mm mortars, 7 grenade launchers, 67 heavy machine guns, 248 light machine guns, 165 submachine guns, 3 anti-tank rifles, 5 rifle grenade launchers, 5,122 rifles and carbines, 1,067,557 rounds of various bullets, 7,602 rounds of various shells, 3,147 hand grenades, 34 vehicles, 246 mules and horses, 7 radio stations, numerous factories and warehouses, and countless other materials.\n\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th] The Northeast People's Liberation Army Headquarters has issued Operations Communiqué No. 25, announcing the details and preliminary battle results of the Faku pursuit battle as follows: Our field corps, at the beginning of the winter offensive, launched a surprise attack to encircle Faku City, a satellite stronghold of Shenyang. The defending 62nd Provisional Division of the New 6th Army was in a desperate situation due to lack of food, coal, and suffering from hunger and cold. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, they once attempted to break out to the south but were blocked by us and forced to retreat. On the 17th, at dusk, they burned most of their ammunition, supplies, and civilian houses before abandoning the city and fleeing in a northeasterly direction, specifically taking remote and desolate paths, desperately struggling through the wilderness with snow up to their knees. However, when they fled to the Wafang area, less than 40 miles from the county seat, they were intercepted by our ambushing troops. The enemy, fearing ambushes in front and pursuers behind, dared not fight and dispersed to break out. After two days and three nights of blocking and pursuit, we finally surrounded the enemy in the Hejia Youfang, Dafang Shen, Liangzhongqiao, and Xiawazi areas between Faku and Changtu on the 19th. At 9:00 PM that night, we separately annihilated them. Except for a very small number of enemies who managed to escape to the Kaiyuan direction, the entire enemy division was wiped out, and our army immediately recovered Faku County. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows: (1) Annihilated 7,238 enemies, including 1,220 killed or wounded and 6,018 captured alive. Among the enemy officers above the rank of colonel who have been identified so far are: Han Zhuohai, regimental commander of the 1st Regiment of the 62nd Provisional Division; Zhang Shaozeng, deputy regimental commander; Zhao Zhongfu, deputy regimental commander; Li Zuoping, major battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of that regiment; Zhao Zhenglai, major battalion commander of the engineer battalion; (name of the) regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment (to be determined), and many others. (2) Captured: 3 field guns, 5 mountain guns, 8 rocket launchers, 12 mortars, 51 60mm mortars, 27 grenade launchers, 312 light and heavy machine guns, 5 anti-aircraft machine guns, 339 submachine guns, 46 automatic rifles, 2,697 rifles and carbines, over a million rounds of various bullets, over 1,100 rounds of shells, 4 vehicles, 40 train cars, one enemy plane was damaged, and some other military supplies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 收复钢都鞍山与法库两仗　我共歼匪一万九千\n\n1948-02-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　收复钢都鞍山与法库两仗\n  　我共歼匪一万九千\n    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北人民解放军司令部顷发表第二十四号作战公报，公布鞍山之役经过及初步战果统计如下：\n    我野战兵团于十九日晨七时二十五分对钢铁中心城市鞍山城发起总攻，在炮火掩护下，步兵勇猛冲锋，仅十五分钟即冲破其市效东南主要防线神社山、立山诸阵地。我另部亦于九时半进占铁道以西大部地区，并攻占伪市府及车站，至此激烈战斗逐渐转入市区敌主要依托钢骨水泥之强固工事据点，如制钢所、对炉山、磋盘街、中央银行等之争夺。当日午夜二十四时各该据点均落入我手，战斗乃告结束。我军收复鞍山县城，全歼守敌五十二军二十五师全部及交警、矿警等部共一万二千余之众，自敌正副师长以下无一漏网。此役初步战果统计如下：（一）歼敌一二、九九七名，其中毙伤敌二、四三九名、生俘一○、五五八名、俘敌校级以上军官现已查明者计有：敌五十二军二十五师师长胡晋生、副师长罗玉恒、五十二军直属野炮营少校副营长李卢、少校工兵营长徐钦章、二十五师运输营少校副营长蒋智愚、鞍山市警察局上校局长江东山、钢铁公司警卫大队上校大队长毛田锁等多名，毙敌鞍山市市长罗永年等多名。（二）缴获：各种炮一○七门，计：野炮五门、山炮二门、战防炮八门、平射炮四门、步兵炮一门、迫击炮二十九门、六○炮五十八门，另缴掷弹筒七个、重机枪六十七挺、轻机枪二四八挺、冲锋式一六五支、战防枪三支、枪榴筒五个、长短枪五一二二支、各种子弹一○六七五五七发，各种炮弹七六○二发，手榴弹三一四七颗、汽车三十四辆、骡马二四六匹、电台七部、工厂仓库多所及其他物资无算。\n    【新华社东北二十四日电】东北人民解放军司令部顷发表二十五号作战公报，公布法库追歼战经过及初步战果统计如下：我野战兵团于冬季攻势开始时以突然奔袭围困沈阳卫星据点之法库城，守敌新六军暂六十二师处于缺粮、缺煤、饥寒交迫之绝境，故本月十五日曾一度向南突围，遭我阻击逃回，复于十七日黄昏将大部弹药物资及民房焚毁后，弃城向东北方向逃窜，专取荒僻小径，在雪深没膝的荒野中狼狈奔命，但逃至距县城不及四十里之瓦房一带时，即为我预伏部队拦住，敌以前有伏兵，后有追兵，不敢一战，即分散突围，经我两日三夜之堵击尾追，终于十九日将敌团团包围于法库及昌图间之何家油房，大房身、亮中桥、下洼子一带，当夜二十一时即分别聚歼，除极少数敌侥幸漏网逃往开原方向外，匪军全师覆歼，我军当即收复法库县城。此役战果初步统计如下：（一）歼敌七二三八名，其中毙伤一二二○名，俘敌六○一八名，俘敌校级以上军官现已查明者计有：敌暂六十二师一团团长韩卓怀，副团长张绍增，团副赵忠浮，该团二营少校营长李作平，工兵营少校营长赵正来、二团团长（姓名待查）等多名。（二）缴获：野炮三门、山炮五门及火箭炮八门、迫击炮十二门、六○炮五十一门、掷弹筒二十七个、轻重机枪三一二挺、高射机枪五挺、冲锋式三三九支、自动步枪四十六支、长短枪二六九七支、各种子弹百余万发、炮弹一千一百余发、汽车四辆、火车四十辆、击伤敌机一架，其他军用物资一部。"

    "content": "Joint Notice from Xin Dazhong Newspaper and Postal Administration to all Post Office Station Masters:\n\n　　The seventh issue of Xin Dazhong Newspaper contained a price increase announcement for the March issue. However, because the publication was too late and the Postal Administration was not consulted beforehand, local post offices have already begun subscribing to the March issue. If we were to collect additional fees now, many difficulties would arise. To facilitate distribution and overcome procedural chaos, it has been renegotiated: The price of Xin Dazhong Newspaper will be increased from April onwards to 350 yuan per copy per month. Starting March 1st, all subscriptions for April or later issues will be charged at the new price of 350 yuan. However, regardless of when, all subscriptions for the March issue will be charged at the original price of 200 yuan, with no increase (overpayments made at the new price should be refunded to subscribers immediately). The following specific regulations are stipulated:\n\n　　I. All subscriptions for April or later issues already made in January and February will be honored, and no additional fees will be charged based on the new price.\n\n　　II. However, starting March 1st, if there are still subscriptions for April or later issues made at the old price (200 yuan), the difference should be collected to bring the price up to the new price (350 yuan). Post offices must patiently explain the reasons to subscribers, work diligently, and be responsible for collecting the additional fees, with a deadline of March 20th for reporting back to the newspaper.\n\n　　III. If, before March 1st, any March issue subscriptions were made at the new price, or if any April or later subscriptions were made at the new price after receiving the price increase announcement in the seventh issue of Xin Dazhong, the overpaid amount should be fully refunded to the subscribers, and the reasons should be explained.\n\n　　IV. All post offices and stations must not falsely report subscription dates or overcharge or fail to refund fees, otherwise, they will be subject to punishment.\n\n　　V. Accounting procedures for collecting additional fees and refunding fees:\n\n　　A. When refunding overpaid fees, the subscriber should issue a receipt stating \"Received from the post office, overpaid subscription fee for Xin Dazhong in the month of ××, ×× yuan exactly,\" with the subscriber's seal. When collecting additional fees, a receipt for the additional fees should be issued to the subscriber. All these procedures must be completed by March 20th.\n\n　　B. Prepare three copies each of the lists of additional fees collected and fees refunded, indicating the month, number of copies, and the amount of additional fees collected and refunded. Send one copy to the General Administration, one to the District Administration, and one to the newspaper for reconciliation. The subscriber's receipt should be sent to the General Administration for verification.\n\n　　C. For those who remit payment with four-part forms, the General Administration will verify and correct them. For those who remit payment with money orders, each post office should contact the newspaper directly to settle the overpayments and underpayments.\n\n　　All post offices and stations should implement this notice immediately upon receipt. They must also inspect and assist all postal agencies, sales outlets, and distribution networks to ensure thorough implementation and avoid errors!\n\n　　　　　This notice issued on February 20th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新大众报社  邮政总局联合通知\n\n1948-02-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新大众报社  邮政总局联合通知各邮局站长：\n    新大众第七期关于三月份报纸增价启事，因登载时间太晚，且未与邮总交换意见时，各地邮局已将三月份报纸订起，如再行补收报费，困难必多。为便利发行克服手续紊乱起见，兹经重新商定：新大众报纸改自四月份起增价，每份每月三百五十元。自三月一日起，凡预订四月或四月以后报纸者，一律按新价三百五十元收费。但不论何时，凡补订三月份报纸者，都按原价二百元收费，不予增加（已按新价之多收部分，应即退还订户）。并具体规定几点如下：\n    一、凡一、二月份已经预订的四月或四月以后的报纸，一律照发，不再按新价补收。\n    二、但自三月一日起，如仍有按旧价（二百元）预订的四月或四月以后报纸时，则应一律按新价（三百五十元）补收齐全。必须向订户耐心解释，说明原因，认真努力，负责补收，并限三月二十日结束，汇报报社。\n    三、凡三月一日前，如因接到新大众第七期增价启事，即已按新价补订的三月份报纸，或按新价预订的四月及四月以后报纸者，应将多收之报价全部退还订户，并说明原因。\n    四、各局站不得假报订期，额外多收或该退不退等事情，否则，须受处分。\n    五、补收与退还报费的会计手续。\n    甲、多收之报费退还时，由订户开具“收到邮局×月份多收之新大众订报费××元正”订户盖章之收条。如补收报费时，应给订户开具补收报费收据。均限三月二十日前办理完毕。\n    乙、将补收与退还之报费，分别列表各三份，注明月份、份数、补收与退还钱数，分寄总局、区局及报社，以便对帐。并将订户收条寄总局备核。\n    丙、用四联单拨付报费者，由总局核对更正。用汇票汇交报费者，由各局自行与报社接洽，多退少补。\n    各局站接到本通知后，即应照办执行。并须检查帮助各邮务所、代办所、代售处、发行网等，务求贯彻而免差错为要！\n    　　　　　此通知　　　　　　　　二月二十日"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Washington dispatch: Truman's submission of the 1948 Aid-Chiang Plan to the U.S. Congress on the 18th, along with Marshall's announcement of the detailed Aid-Chiang program to the U.S. Congress on the 20th, clearly exposes U.S. imperialism's arrogant ambition to invade China. Marshall plainly declared that among the $570 million Aid-Chiang plan, $510 million of material \"aid\" was to give the Chiang bandits the \"dollar ability to purchase military supplies\" to continue slaughtering the Chinese people. The plan also stipulated that the Chiang bandits must sell national economic sovereignty, such as the Shanghai Power Company, the Yuehan Railway, the Ganxi and Xiangtan coal mines in Hunan, as well as the Taiwan Sugar Company, fertilizer plants and cement plants and port facilities in Taiwan and South China, allowing U.S. imperialism to invest and control them. This \"aid\" would amount to $60 million. The plan also blatantly stipulated that U.S. imperialism could plunder China's \"strategic materials,\" and the Chiang bandits must \"sell\" all such strategic materials to the \"United States\" within a so-called \"certain period.\" The U.S. imperialism could also obtain great supervisory power over the production and distribution of materials in the Chiang area and the Chiang bandits' finances. The Chiang bandit government should submit a report to the U.S. government at least once every quarter on the \"use\" of U.S. aid and the \"progress of future work.\" At the same time, the plan stipulated that the Chiang bandits must guarantee to improve \"commercial relations\" with the U.S., to further facilitate the dumping of U.S. goods in China. To achieve the above-mentioned goals of invading China, U.S. imperialism could send \"any personnel employed by the United States\" to act as \"advisors\" to the Chiang bandit government, and send \"members of Congress approved by the House or Senate and representatives of American newspapers and radio stations\" to China for \"inspection.\" To ensure that the personnel sent to China fully meet the needs of invading China, the plan stipulated that the U.S. intelligence agency, the \"Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" has the right to review whether these personnel are \"clean.\" The plan also instructed the Chiang bandits to continuously carry out propaganda about \"U.S. aid\" \"using all media within China\" to cover up the bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism's invasion of China. In addition to the above, the U.S. president can also at any time propose to the Chiang bandits any \"other guarantees\" related to U.S. imperialist privileges that the \"president may deem necessary\" to be vigorously implemented.\n    \n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. According to a report from the U.S. Imperialist United Press in Washington on the 21st: A memorandum from the U.S. State Department to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed that the United States has approved several \"contracts\" to sell U.S. war surplus materials cheaply to Chiang Kai-shek, including aircraft and ammunition. One of the contracts stipulates that ammunition currently stockpiled in the Marianas will be transferred to the Chiang bandits, who will only pay one percent of the price; another stipulates that materials originally worth millions of dollars will be purchased by the Chiang bandits at 12.5 percent of the original price.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: Moscow Radio on the 17th broadcasted Kibanov's commentary, severely condemning American imperialist lackeys Hu Shih and Zeng Qi for defending the American imperialist policy of world expansion and slandering the Soviet Union, the great friend of the Chinese people, and other shameless acts. The original text roughly states: Chinese social figures oppose the United States' support for Japanese fascism and expose that the American imperialists have violated their previous obligations and changed their attitude towards the Japanese and German peace treaties, turning these countries into bases for anti-Soviet activities. This righteous call is not to the liking of the American imperialists, so they mobilized their lackeys, such as Hu Shih, to defend the American policy towards Japan. Hu Shih attempted to shift the responsibility for creating international tensions onto the Soviet Union and tried to prove that the entire American policy has not exceeded the scope of the Potsdam Declaration, and shamelessly equated the Soviet Union, the great friend of the Chinese people, with fascist Germany and Japan. In order to curry favor with his master, the United States, Zeng Qi, the leader of the so-called China Youth Party, also hurriedly came forward to defend the United States. However, the Chinese people are not as easily deceived as Hu Shih and Zeng Qi imagined. They know very well that the Soviet Union has put forward many concrete proposals in order to quickly sign peace treaties with Germany and Austria, and it is the so-called Western democratic countries, headed by the United States, that have consistently opposed these proposals and disregarded the Potsdam Conference's resolutions on demilitarizing and democratizing Germany. The Soviet Union has consistently advocated close international cooperation in strengthening democratic peace and safeguarding the security of all countries; while the United States has abandoned the principle of international cooperation and concerted action among the major powers, and has adopted a policy of openly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, assisting the reactionary forces in these countries against their own democratic forces.\n    Chinese social figures are also very clear that since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has consistently supported the freedom and independence of the Chinese people and has consistently opposed imperialist attempts to enslave the great Chinese nation. The Soviet Union was the main force in crushing Hitler's Germany and made a decisive contribution to defeating Japanese imperialism, thus helping the Chinese people maintain their independence. After the war, American imperialism attempted to turn China into its own colony, and the Soviet Union became a powerful obstacle to the implementation of this plan. The Chinese people know that maintaining close friendship with their great neighbor, the Soviet Union, is a guarantee of maintaining their independence and the integrity of Chinese territory. It is precisely for this reason that the lackeys of American imperialism are roaring so loudly in an attempt to slander the great friend of the Chinese people, the Soviet Union. Chinese social figures know that Hu Shih has been serving the American imperialists for a long time. Throughout the entire war, he lived in the United States, completely detached from the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan. It is more accurate to say that he is an American than a Chinese, and he has completely lost his prestige in Chinese cultural circles. After Japan surrendered, he served as the president of Peking University and established close ties with the American military officers of the Executive Headquarters. He not only did not express any protest against the American soldiers' slaughter of Chinese coolies and the rape of his female students at Peking University, but also tried his best to suppress the righteous indignation of the Chinese people aroused by the atrocities of the American soldiers raping female students at Peking University. Zeng Qi is a notorious Chinese traitor. He was a worshipper of fascism long ago. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served Japan and later switched to Chiang Kai-shek to serve the United States. The shameless rumors of Hu Shih and Zeng Qi, the lackeys of American imperialism, slandering the Soviet Union are bound to go bankrupt, because the Chinese people have long known that the Soviet Union is their loyal and sincere friend.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏广播斥美走狗胡适曾琦\n\n1948-02-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏广播斥美走狗胡适曾琦\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】莫斯科电台十七日广播基盘诺夫评论，痛斥美帝走狗胡适、曾琦之流为美帝世界扩张政策辩护，并诽谤中国人民伟大友人苏联等无耻行为。原文略称：中国社会人士反对美国扶植日本法西斯，并揭露美帝已违背自己以前担负的义务，改变自己对日、德和约的态度，正在把这些国家变成为反苏的根据地。这种正义呼声是不适合于美帝胃口的，因此他便动员他的走狗如胡适之流，为美国对日政策辩护。胡适企图将造成国际紧张局势的责任推到苏联身上，又企图证明美国的全部政策没有超过波茨顿宣言的范围，并且卑鄙无耻的把中国人民的伟大友人苏联与法西斯德、日并列，为了向自己的主子美国献媚，所谓中国青年党领袖曾琦也慌忙起来替美国辩护。可是中国人民并不如胡适和曾琦所想象那样容易受欺骗，他们很清楚苏联为了要迅速与德、奥签订和约曾提出许多具体建议，而经常反对这些建议，蔑视波茨顿会议关于使德国非军国主义化和使其民主化的决议的，正是以美国为首的所谓西方民主国家。苏联经常主张在加强民主和平与保障各国安全事业上实行密切的国际合作；而美国则放弃了国际合作与各大列强一致行动的原则，采取公开的干涉其他国家内政的政策，援助这些国家的反动势力对抗本国的民主力量。\n    中国社会人士并且很清楚的知道，自从十月革命以来，苏联一贯拥护中国人民的自由与独立，经常反对帝国主义想奴役伟大中国民族的企图。苏联是粉碎希特勒德国的主要力量，并且对击败日本帝国主义做了有决定意义贡献，因此帮助了中国人民保持着自己的独立。战后美帝国主义企图把中国变成自己的殖民地，苏联成了他们实行这种计划的强大障碍。中国人民知道与自己的伟大邻邦--苏联保持密切的友好，是保持自己独立和中国领土完整的保证，正是由于这个原因，美帝国主义的走狗们，才如此咆哮的企图诽谤中国人民的伟大友人苏联。中国社会人士知道胡适很早就替美帝效劳，在整个战时他都住在美国，完全脱离了中国人民的抗日战争，与其说他是中国人，倒不如说他是美国人，他在中国文化界早已完全丧失了威信。他在日本投降后充当北大校长，与执行部的美国军官建立密切的联系，对美国兵在北平屠杀中国苦力、和强奸他的女学生，不但没有表示任何抗议，反而竭力压制因美军强奸北大女生兽行而激起中国人民的义愤。曾琦是中国臭名昭著的汉奸，他老早就是法西斯的崇拜者。在抗战期间他替日本效劳，后来又转到蒋介石那里替美国服务。美帝国主义走狗胡适、曾琦诽谤苏联的无耻造谣一定遭到破产，因为中国人民老早就知道苏联是他们忠实诚挚的友人。"

    "title": "Landlord Traitor from Xisuzhuang Squeezes into the Party, Seizes Power and Opens Fire on the Poor and Hired Peasants",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-26",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[News from our paper] The investigation team organized jointly by the Border Region Government and this newspaper, during the investigation of the Wei case, carefully learned about the situation in Xisuzhuang. The main characteristic of this village is that landlords and traitors squeezed into the Party, controlled everything, and used the Party's land reform policy to attack poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants.\n\n　　Xisuzhuang has a total of 89 households, 339 people, and 2,133 mu of land. The ten landlord and rich peasant households occupy almost half of the village's land, and all of it is good land. The 24 poor and hired peasant households, with 50 people, have an average of only 1.8 mu of bad land per person. After the \"July 7th\" Incident, the Japanese invaders occupied Shahe, and the Kuomintang army retreated south, looting along the way. Bandits rose up, and the masses suffered considerable losses. In the spring of 1938, after our army arrived, an anti-Japanese government was established. Landlord Wei Jinqi evaded burdens and fled, and other landlords also mostly stopped hiring laborers, divided up their families and dispersed their land to conceal their property. In the winter, the enemy occupied Gongsiyao and Yangfan Town (both more than ten li away from the village). In 1940, the enemy built two lines of blockades west of the Pinghan Railway. A blockhouse was built east of the village, and it became an enemy-occupied area. In the two years of severe famine in 1942 and 1943, less than 100 people remained in the village (mostly landlords and rich peasants). The number of livestock, which was about 150 at the beginning of the war, had been reduced to less than 40, and there were no mules at all. The enemy imposed many donations, and the grain collectors could not cope. The landlords and rich peasants hired middle and poor peasants to act as puppet Bao chiefs, taking turns. In 1944, our armed work team advanced behind enemy lines, and began to establish a secret anti-Japanese government and militia in the village. Some of the cadres who persisted in the struggle against the enemy at that time, including Wei Ziyi, the son of Wei Dianhua, were all poor peasants. The village militia was once surrounded by the enemy, and three were killed. They all performed very well in the struggle. Later, as the situation improved, the landlord Wei Jintang squeezed in. He had become sworn brothers with Hu Daosheng, the commander of the puppet army, and relied on Hu's power to become a puppet township chief. He also opened a salt shop with Hu's younger brother. At first, he pretended to be actively resisting Japan, and later became the manager of the cooperative. In the summer of 1945, worker Liu Xiucheng introduced him into the Party without investigation. He quickly became the director of the Armed Committee and seized all the power in the village. He privately replaced the village chief with his henchman Wei Jingsheng (a middle peasant), and introduced a gang of bad elements: militia captain Wei Jinnyu and self-defense captain Wei Jinmei were his cousins, and their background was bankrupt rich peasants. Cooperative manager Wei Fengming and village secretary Wei Jinming were all his close relatives, and all were rich peasants. Overall, out of the eleven village cadres, nine had been traitors, puppet soldiers, or puppet Bao chiefs. Everything was according to Wei Jintang's word. In the spring of 1946, Wei Jintang was promoted to the district as an assistant for culture and education. After Wei left the village for the district, in order to continue to wield power, he promoted Wei Jingwu to succeed him as the director of the Armed Committee. Wei Jingwu's family used to be rich peasants, but they had gone bankrupt. He himself had never worked since he was a child. At the beginning of the war against Japan, he became a bandit, was captured by us, and later escaped home to join the enemy, becoming a puppet soldier under Gao Delin. Later, he was captured by us again. He was injured in the Pinghan Campaign and returned home before being demobilized. Wei Jingwu successively served as branch secretary, sharing power with the village chief.\n\n　　Because power was in the hands of the landlords, the \"mass movement\" in Xisuzhuang was mainly not to struggle against feudal forces, but to struggle against poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants. This big rock slab has never been overturned and broken, and the masses have been suppressed and unable to rise up. Since the Japanese surrender, the village has undergone three major movements, but some struggles were fake struggles. After Wei Fenglin's family was struggled against, he sent his son to join the army. The cadres, under the pretext of giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers, returned all the things that had been struggled out and even gave him three more houses. The cadres called this \"struggling against exploitation, supplementing the families of soldiers.\" The three families of Wei Caiqun, Wei Jingxun, and Wei Fengtong were all landlords and rich peasants from the Ming Dynasty. But because they had some connections with the cadres in power, they were all sheltered. Not only were they not struggled against, but they also divided up a lot of the fruits of the struggle. The village cadres looked for various excuses to struggle against middle and poor peasants, creating disputes between middle and poor peasants, and even mobilizing landlords and rich peasants to struggle against middle and poor peasants. A total of sixteen poor and middle peasant households in the village were struggled against. Wei Jingyang had been a farmhand in Wei Fengyuan's house before the war against Japan, and only rose to the level of a middle peasant at the beginning of the war. However, the village cadres took advantage of his mistake of buying salt for ten people and struggled him for eight sacks of grain and fifteen sacks of wheat, taking away all the grain for the year. And the Wei Fengyuan and Wei Fengkui brothers who hired him were instead able to divide up his grain. The poor peasant Wei Jianxin did not have a mu of land. He bought a mu of land in the year of famine. Another poor peasant, Wei Jingliang, also bought four mu of land. The village chief incited the land sellers (middle peasants) to force them into struggle. Village chief Wei Jinsheng and village Armed Committee director Wei Jingwu committed many evils when they jointly held power in the village. The village chief suspected that his mistress had a relationship with the poor peasant Wei Tanbao, so he conspired with the director of the Armed Committee to beat Wei Tanbao to death. Five peasants were beaten, thirty-one were detained, and six were falsely accused of being \"special agents.\" Whoever was late for a meeting was beaten, and whoever did not attend was fined two catties of oil. Seventeen people were fined. In order to better consolidate their rule, they bought off some of the masses to inform them, cheer them on, and commit violence. They also encouraged them, saying: \"Just go ahead and do it. If you do something wrong in the future and get your head cut off, we have the director and the village chief!\" Poor peasant Wei Laodi said: \"Whenever I hear the drums beating for a meeting, my legs shake with fear. I used to be a farmhand for the landlords and rich men, and I dared to sing a few wild tunes. Now I don't even dare to say a word. Don't even talk about dividing things, I don't even know if I can keep my life!\"\n\n　　From the perspective of the amount of land distributed, the poor peasants and hired laborers did increase some land compared to the past. Before the movement, thirteen poor peasant and hired laborer households had 154.7 mu of land. After the movement, it increased to 343.9 mu, averaging 7.9 mu of land per person, and averaging 3.74 shi of grain per person (this figure was assessed by the cadres in 1945), while the thirteen cadres and activists had 435.1 mu of land, averaging 9.7 mu per person, and averaging 6.2 shi of grain per person, averaging 6.3 dou per mu. The grain production of the cadres was twice that of the poor peasants and hired laborers. The two families of the poor peasants Wei Dianhua and Wei Xianfu, who were swept out of the house, had less than two mu of land per person, and averaged less than five dou of grain per person. The rich peasant Wei Caiqun, who was sheltered by the village cadres in power and not struggled against, had an average of ten mu of land per person and an average of 5.8 shi of grain per person. A total of 27 livestock were struggled out in the village, and the village cadres divided up 15, while the poor peasants and hired laborers only got three. The director of the Armed Committee divided up two, and sold one. The poor peasant Wei Jianxin took his chance and grabbed a piece of paper with a donkey on it. He couldn't use it himself, and was often dragged by the Farmers' Association to grind flour. Later, the village cadres used the excuse of taking care of newcomers from Shanxi and forced him to \"support\" it. He fed it for seven months and lost the fodder for nothing.\n\n　　A total of 20 good courtyards and houses were struggled out, and the cadres occupied ten of them. The masses generally shared one courtyard between two households, while the cadres each occupied one courtyard alone. Good farm tools, clothes, and furniture were also taken by the village cadres. At least 200 shi of grain were not distributed, and it was announced that anyone who had not eaten could go and collect it. But poor peasants and hired laborers could not get it if they wanted to eat it, while the cadres could take it at will. Now there is not a single grain left. After the promulgation of the Outline Land Law, Armed Committee director Wei Jingwu still ate and drank extravagantly. He ground 1.2 shi of wheat for the New Year, slaughtered a pig, and even split the three extra rooms he occupied into firewood and burned it. The village chief's expenses were not accounted for, and the cooperative's accounts were never announced to the masses. Last winter, the whole village raised 200,000 yuan to establish a credit cooperative, which was all taken by Wei Jingwu to buy mules for himself. Now there are 16 poor peasant and hired laborer families who lack houses, livestock, and farm tools (plows, seeders, rakes). Old man Wei Youde, 69 years old, had been a farmhand all his life. He was told that he was too old to be allocated a house, but he was ordered, along with Gou Shidi, Wei Dianchen, and three other poor peasants and hired laborers in their sixties, to cultivate and carry water for the families of soldiers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西苏庄地主汉奸钻进党内　掌握大权向贫雇开刀\n\n1948-02-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西苏庄地主汉奸钻进党内\n  　掌握大权向贫雇开刀\n    【本报消息】边府与本报共同组织的调查组，在进行魏案的调查中，仔细的了解了西苏庄的情况，该村主要的特点是地主、汉奸钻进党内，把持一切，利用了党的土地改革政策，向贫雇中农开刀。\n    西苏庄共八十九户，三百三十九口人，二千一百零三十三亩地，十户地主富农，几乎占了全村土地的一半，而且全是好地。贫雇二十四户五十口人，每人平均只有一亩八分坏地。“七七”事变后，日寇侵陷沙河，国民党军队向南溃退，沿途大肆抢掠，土匪蜂起，群众损失不小。三八年春我军到达后，曾建立抗日政权。地主魏锦奇躲避负担逃亡，其他地主亦多停止雇工，分家分散土地，隐蔽财产。是冬敌进占公司窑、羊范镇（均距该村十余里），四○年敌在平汉路西筑二道封锁线，该村村东按了炮楼，遂沦为敌占区。四二、四三两年大灾荒，全村逃得剩下不到一百人（留下的多系地主富农），抗战初约有一百五十头牲口，至此已减到不足四十头，骡子一头也没有了。敌人捐款甚多，粮差无法应付，地主富农乃雇中贫农出面当伪保长，轮流替换。四四年经我武工队挺进敌后，又开始在该村建立秘密抗日政权与民兵。逃荒的中贫农也陆续回村。当时坚持对敌斗争的几个干部，其中有魏殿花之子魏子义，都是贫农。该村民兵曾被敌人包围，杀死三个，斗争中都表现得很好。后来局面好转，地主魏锦堂便钻进来了。他曾经与伪军团长胡道生拜把子，并依附胡势力当了伪大乡长，还与胡的弟弟伙开过盐店。他起初假装积极抗日，后来当了合作社经理。四五年夏天，工作员刘秀成不加考查，便介绍他钻进党内。很快就当了武委会主任掌握了全村大权。私自把村长换成他的狗腿魏景升（中农），引进了一伙坏蛋：民兵队长魏锦雨、自卫队长魏锦美都是他叔伯弟兄，成份是破落富农。合作社经理魏凤鸣、村书记魏锦明都是他近门兄弟，都是富农。总起来看十一个村干中，有九个人都当过汉奸、伪军、伪保长，一切是听魏锦堂的话。四六年春，魏锦堂又被提拔到区上任文教助理员。魏离村到区后，为继续掌权，便提拔魏景武继任武委会主任。魏景武过去家庭是富农，破落了，他自己从小没劳动过。抗战初当土匪，被我俘虏，后逃跑回家投敌，当高德林伪军，后又被我俘虏。平汉战役负伤未经退伍即回家，魏景武并先后任支书，与村长分掌大权。\n    由于大权是掌在地主手里的，因此西苏庄的“群众运动”，主要不是斗争封建势力，而是斗争贫雇、中农。这块大石板一直没有掀翻打碎，群众一直被压着不能起来。日本投降以来，该村经过三次大运动，但有些斗争是假斗。魏凤林家被斗后，把儿子送去参军。干部借口优待抗属，把斗出来的东西全部退回，还多分给他三间房子。干部叫这是“斗争剥削，补充抗属”。魏财群、魏景训、魏凤同三家都是明朝下来的地主富农。但因与当权干部有些瓜葛，便都包庇了下来，不仅没有斗，反而分了不少斗争果实。村干寻找各种借口，斗争中农贫雇，制造中贫农之间的纠纷，甚至发动地主富农来斗争中贫农。全村贫雇中农被斗争的共有十六户之多。魏景洋抗战前还在魏凤元家当长工，抗战初才上升为中农。村干却拿他多买了十个人盐的错，斗了他八布袋谷，十五布袋麦子。把全年的粮食都斗光了。而雇他工的魏凤元、魏凤魁兄弟反而来分他的粮食。贫雇魏见心没有一亩地，灾荒年买了一亩地。另一贫雇魏景良也买了四亩地，村长便挑拨卖地户（中农）硬将他们斗了。村长魏锦升与村武委会主任魏景武在村分掌大权时，作恶很多。村长怀疑自己的姘头与贫雇魏谈宝有关系，便与武委会主任合谋将魏谈宝打死。农民中有五个人被打过，有三十一个人被扣过，有六个人被诬指为“特务”。开会时谁到迟了就打，谁不到罚二斤油，曾有十七人被罚。他们为了更好的巩固自己的统治，曾收买了一些群众，替他们通风报信，呐喊行凶。他们并鼓励说：“尽管往前干，将来做错了杀头，有咱主任和村长！”贫雇魏老弟说：“一听到打鼓开会，腿肚子就吓得打哆嗦，我以前给地主老财住觅汉（当长工），还敢放野腔唱一唱，现在连声也不敢吭了，不要说分东西的话，连命还不知道保不保哩！”\n    从土地分配数量上看，贫雇是比过去增加了些土地，运动前十三户贫雇有土地一百五十四亩七分，运动后增加到三百四十三亩九分，每人平均地七亩九分，每人平均产粮三石七斗四升，每亩平均产粮四斗六升（这数字是四五年干部评议的），而十三户干部、积极分子却有土地四百三十五亩一分，每人平均地九亩七分，每人平均产粮六石二斗，每亩平均产粮六斗三升。干部产粮比贫雇多一倍。被扫地出门的贫雇魏殿花、魏贤福，两家每口人平均地还不到二亩，每口人平均产粮五斗。被掌权村干包庇没斗的富农魏财群，却每人平均地十亩，每口人平均产粮五石八斗。全村共斗出二十七头牲口，村干分了十五头，贫雇只得了三头。武委会主任分了两头，卖了一头，贫雇魏见心碰运气抓纸蛋抓到一头驴，自己用不上，时常被农会牵去推磨，后来村干又借口照顾山西新来户，强逼他“拥护”出来，他喂了七个月，白赔了草料。\n    好院好房，共斗出二十座，干部就占了十座。群众一般都是两户分一座院，干部都是每户独占一座。农具、衣服、家具好的也都被村干占了去。粮食至少有二百石没有分，宣布是谁没有吃了可以去领。但是贫雇要吃就领不到，干部却可随便拿，现在一颗也没有了。土地法大纲公布后武委会主任魏景武仍然大吃二喝，过年磨了一石二斗麦子，杀了一口猪，还把多占的三间房劈成柴火烧了。村长开支没有帐目，合作社的帐也从没有向群众宣布过，去冬全村集股二十万元成立信用社，都被魏景武拿去给自己买了骡子。现在贫雇中缺房子、缺牲口、缺农具（犁耧耢耙）的十六家。六十九岁老汉魏有德，做了一辈子长工。说他老了，不能分房子，但却又命令他和狗屎爹、魏殿臣等三个六十多岁的贫雇老汉给抗属代耕、担水。"

    "content": "Joint Investigation by the Border Government and this Newspaper Reveals the Truth of the Wei Dianhua Case\n　　Relevant Perpetrators Will Be Subject to People's Justice\n　　[News from this newspaper] The incident of Wei Dianhua, a poor peasant, hired laborer, and honorably retired soldier from Xisuzhuang, Third District of Shahe, being falsely accused as a \"special agent,\" has garnered significant attention from readers across various regions following its exposure in this newspaper, with numerous letters of inquiry received. After an eighteen-day investigation, the truth of the entire case has come to light. Wei Dianhua, with the boundless loyalty and bravery of a Communist Party member, waged an unyielding struggle against landlords and traitors who had infiltrated the Party and manipulated village governance to oppress the poor and hired laborers. He suffered severe persecution. Due to bureaucratic leadership, justice has only now been served. The sequence of events is as follows:\n　　Wei Dianhua, a 56-year-old man who had been a hired farmhand for three generations, joined the Party in 1938 and participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, later serving as a traffic officer for the enemy work station, undertaking secret missions. He consistently demonstrated resolve by repeatedly completing arduous tasks. Due to old age and disability, he honorably retired to his hometown in the summer of 1946 and once again engaged in a tenacious struggle against landlords and traitors who had infiltrated the Party. He was falsely accused of being a \"special agent,\" enduring immense suffering, forbidden from speaking to others, and prohibited from leaving the village. Later, upon seeing the grievances of the poor and hired laborers in the newspaper, he secretly escaped to this newspaper to appeal for justice. He said, \"I will be responsible for every word I say. I am old, and while I may have difficulty remembering things, I will never exaggerate.\" This newspaper initially determined the nature of the problem as an attack by landlords on the poor and hired laborers. However, due to the complexity of the situation and the urgent need for investigation, he was introduced to the Border Government. The Border Government also attached great importance to the matter. Chairmen Yang and Zhang personally spoke with him and decided to dispatch an investigation team jointly with this newspaper. Wei, having suffered from bureaucracy in the past, harbored suspicions towards the investigation team. On the way, he said, \"You will send me to the Special Commissioner's Office, who will then send me to the county, who will then send me to the district, who will then send me to the village, and my problem will still not be resolved.\"\n　　After the investigation team arrived at the Sixth Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Committee Secretary Zhang Huiru and Commissioner Hou Guoying immediately convened relevant county and district cadres (including Comrade Wang Dian, who introduced Wei into the Party) that same evening to study the situation and further determine the nature of the problem. County and district leaders, who had previously viewed this as a sectarian struggle, began to realize that they had been looking at the poor and hired laborers with a sectarian perspective. Comrade Wang Dian, who had previously supported Wei Dianhua and received much criticism for it, dared not intervene after Wei was \"rectified\" as a \"special agent.\" The next day, he made a sincere self-criticism to Wei Dianhua. Wei Dianhua was overcome with emotion as if seeing a family member, and both wept. Wei expressed that even if his bones turned to ashes, he would never collude with those landlords and traitors. Everyone present could not help but shed tears.\n　　To facilitate the investigation, it was decided to transfer the main perpetrators to the county government. The team, in conjunction with county and district comrades, went directly into the villages to deeply engage with the poor and hired laborers. Another person was left behind to investigate among the village cadres. Initially, the poor and hired laborers were afraid to speak, while the village cadres formed a clique, shielding each other and continuing to slander Wei Dianhua. After individually visiting, listening to their grievances, and talking with them, the poor and hired laborers began to speak about their failure to achieve liberation and exposed the various crimes of the landlords who manipulated village governance and oppressed the poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants (details to follow). Then, separate forums of the poor and hired laborers were convened, and at the same time, based on the materials already obtained, the village cadres were shown the serious attitude of the investigation team. They were told to frankly confess their mistakes to the people and continue to expose each other's misdeeds. The truth of the Wei case then became clearer (details to follow). Following this, joint forums of the middle and poor peasants were convened, clarifying that the landlords' attack on Wei Dianhua was intended to further oppress the poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants. At this time, Wei Dianhua and the main perpetrators had already returned to the village. Thus, a meeting of middle and poor peasants was convened. One after another, people spoke about their grievances, with some raising their hands requesting to speak. The meeting did not end in the morning, nor did it end in the afternoon, but continued late into the night. After deliberation and discussion at the meeting, it was decided to temporarily send the main perpetrators, Wei Jintang and Wei Jingwu, to the county for detention, so that they could be handed over to the people's court for trial. Other bad village cadres were left in the village to repent, to be dealt with according to the extent of their confession and repentance. During the meeting, the bad village cadres were lined up on the side. Wei Yousheng, the finance and grain director, was relatively upright and had not done anything bad. The poor peasant Wei Laixin automatically pulled him out of the group of bad village cadres in public and brought him to stand among the masses. The county party committee has now decided to reinstate Wei Dianhua's Party membership, while urging comrades who practiced bureaucracy and engaged in sectarianism against the poor peasants to deeply reflect on their actions and give them appropriate punishment. Wei Dianhua, until the very end, did not show any signs of arrogance. The county party committee has now established a work team to continue the investigation, thoroughly resolve all problems, and lead the land redistribution movement in Xisuzhuang.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边府本报共同调查结果  魏殿花冤案大白　有关案犯将分别受到人民裁判\n\n1948-02-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边府本报共同调查结果\n    魏殿花冤案大白\n  　有关案犯将分别受到人民裁判\n    【本报消息】沙河三区西苏庄贫雇荣退军人魏殿花被诬害为“特务”的事件在本报披露后，各地读者均极注意，纷纷来函询问。现经十八天的调查，全案真相大白。魏殿花以共产党员的无限忠诚勇敢对钻进党内，操纵村政权，压迫贫雇的地主、汉奸进行不屈不挠的斗争。遭受了严重的迫害。由于领导上的官僚主义，至今始得昭雪。前后经过如下：\n    魏殿花是三代长工，五十六岁，三八年入党，参加抗战，后任敌工站交通员，做秘密工作。屡次完成艰险任务，一贯表现坚决。因年老残废，于四六年夏荣退回乡，又与钻进党内的地主、汉奸展开顽强斗争，被诬指为“特务”，受尽痛苦，不准与人说话，不准离村。后见贫雇在报上诉苦，遂偷跑逃来本报申冤。他说：“我每一句话都要负责，我老了，只有记不清的，决没有多说了的。”本报初步确定了问题性质，是地主向贫雇进攻，但因其中关系复杂，急需调查，即介绍他到边府，边府亦极重视，杨、张主席亲自与他谈话，并决定与本报共派调查小组出发。魏因过去历来吃惯官僚主义的亏，对调查小组存有怀疑。路上他说：“你们把我送到专署，专署又送县，县又送区，区又送村，我问题还是不能解决。”\n    调查小组到六地委后，当晚地委书记张慧如、专员侯国英即召集县、区有关干部（包括介绍魏入党的王典同志）研究情况，进一步确定问题性质，过去认为这是宗派斗争的县、区领导同志，开始觉悟是自己以宗派眼光去看贫雇。王典同志曾为给魏殿花撑腰受过不少批评，把他“整”成“特务”以后就不敢再管了，次日他向魏殿花作诚恳反省，魏殿花如见亲人，双方痛哭。魏表示骨头烂成灰也不能和那些地主、汉奸搞到一起。在旁同志，均不禁落泪。\n    为便于调查，决定把主要案犯调到县府，小组结合县、区同志，到村直接深入贫雇。另留一人专在村干中调查。起初贫雇不敢说话，村干则结成一伙，互相包庇，继续诬蔑魏殿花。经个别访苦谈心，贫雇从自己没有翻身的情况开始谈，揭发地主操纵村政，压迫贫雇中农的种种罪恶（详情见后）。于是分别召集不定数的贫雇座谈，同时依据已得材料，向村干表明严正态度，要他们向人民坦白悔过，并且互相继续揭发材料。魏案真相遂更明晰。（详情见后）接着贫雇中农共同座谈，明确了地主打击魏殿花乃是为了更能压迫贫雇中农。此时魏殿花及主犯均已回村，于是召开中、贫农大会，会上诉苦的一个紧接一个，有人举着双手要求发言，上午没有开完，下午还没有开完，晚上又开到深夜。经大会酝酿讨论，决定将主犯魏锦堂、魏景武暂送县扣押，以便交人民法庭审判。其他坏村干留村反省，按其坦白悔过程度分别处理。开会时坏村干被列在一旁，财粮主任魏有生比较正派，没干坏事，贫雇魏赖心自动当众把他从坏村干中拉出，站到群众中来了。现县委已决定恢复魏殿花的党籍，对官僚主义向贫雇闹宗派的同志，则督促其深刻反省，给以适当处分。而魏殿花直到最后，没有任何骄傲的表现，现县委已成立了工作团，继续调查，彻底解决所有的问题，领导西苏庄的平分运动。"

It is the site of one of the largest steel plants in the Far East, known as the \"Steel Capital,\" \"Iron Capital,\" and the \"Treasure of Manchurian Industry.\" Its iron reserves amount to 600 million tons, accounting for 75% of the total iron ore reserves in Northeast China. It is said that as early as 1,300 years ago, when Emperor Taizong of Tang, Li Shimin, campaigned against Goguryeo and was stationed in Liaoyang, he manufactured weapons near Anshan. In August 1909, the Japanese invaders sent Chutaro Kido, director of the South Manchuria Railway Geological Survey, to conduct an investigation. In April 1915, the Japanese established the Anshan Iron and Steel Works here. After the \"September 18th Incident\" when the Japanese invaders occupied Northeast China, it was renamed Showa Steel Works in June 1932, which the Japanese called the \"foundation of Manchuria's heavy industry.\" The Japanese invaders regarded it as the \"forefront of national policy projects\" in their military industrial production for the invasion of China. Centered around the steel plant, within a radius of 25 li, there are eleven mining areas, including Cherry Orchard, Wangjiabaozi, East Anshan, Central-West Anshan, Dagushan, and Guanmenshan. In addition to iron ore, there are also large quantities of limestone, refractory clay, silica, and magnesite. After the Japanese invaders' so-called two phases of \"increased production plans,\" the annual output of pig iron in 1936 reached 400,000 tons and steel 500,000 tons. At the same time, foundries, refractory industries, zinc, steel pipes, and cast iron industries were also established. The Showa Steel Works formed the center of the so-called \"steel production bloc of Manchuria's powerful strength\" (i.e., a steel monopoly group). In 1937, the Japanese invaders continued to invest and expand operations, totaling 100 million yen, with a planned annual output of 700,000 tons of pig iron and 500,000 tons of steel. In 1938, the capital was increased to 200 million yen. After our army liberated Anshan, it not only removed another important satellite stronghold on the periphery of Shenyang militarily, but also severely struck the military heavy industrial production of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits economically.

    "content": "The Persecution of Wei Dianhua\n\nA microcosm of landlord elements exploiting county and district bureaucracy to infiltrate branch power, leading to farmer oppression.\n\nComrade Wei Dianhua, of hired peasant origin, after the Japanese surrender, saw that the village administration in his village was controlled by a group of landlords and traitors led by Wei Jintang. They struggled against Wei Jianxin, Wei Chunliang, Wei Diankui, and other poor and hired peasants. Qu Yufu, an enemy agent who had led the enemy into the village to kill three militiamen, was even allowed to join the farmers' association and share the spoils of struggle. The village secretary was Wei Jinming, a rich peasant who had been a puppet police officer. He was very angry, and directly confronted the village cadres. Seeing that Old Wei was fighting for the farmers, the village cadres began to attack Old Wei. Once, they forced Wei Zhilian, a bankrupt rich peasant, to falsely accuse Old Wei of conspiring with him to sell a canvas awning, and further accused him of harboring landlords. But Old Wei did not back down because of this. He opposed the \"election\" of the bad person Wei Jingwu as director of the military committee, and later exposed at a mass meeting that the village chief Wei Jingsheng was personally appointed by the landlord Wei Jintang. Both of them saw Old Wei as a thorn in their side. In May of the following year, Old Wei returned home due to old age and disability. He reported the serious situation in his village to the sub-district, who wrote a letter asking him to talk to the county. The county then wrote a letter asking him to talk to the district. He raised to Guo Quanyou, the district political commissar, that puppet soldiers and enemy agents had joined the farmers' association and become cadres, while many poor and hired peasants were shut out of the farmers' association. But Guo Quanyou did not go to the village to investigate. Instead, he listened to Wei Jintang and other cadres, believing that Old Wei liked to take the upper-level route and had personal prejudices against the village cadres. He even refused to transfer Old Wei's Party membership back home. Wei Jintang returned to the village and stirred up trouble, saying, \"Old Wei went to the county and district to sue you. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be able to handle it!\" This made all the village cadres extremely resentful towards Old Wei. Old Wei could not transfer his Party membership back to the village and could not even participate in the farmers' association, so he went to Guo Quanyou. Guo Quanyou always vaguely prevaricated. It was not until the third time that he was introduced back to the village. Although the branch was controlled by landlords, they still did not allow him to participate in Party meetings. However, Old Wei paid his Party dues every month. When land reform began, the village struggled against some landlords and rich peasants who had no direct relationship with these bad village cadres. Although Old Wei was not able to participate in the farmers' association, he was very active in the struggle. The village cadres were forced to give him a courtyard and fifteen mu of land (at that time, the spoils were distributed based on the problem). But Old Wei did not compromise because of this. He continued to demand that all poor and hired peasants participate in the farmers' association and that puppet soldiers and bankrupt landlords be expelled from the farmers' association. He went to the county to make suggestions twice, but to no avail. So he mobilized among the poorest of the poor and hired peasants, wanting to organize them. At this time, the masses demanded to continue the struggle, but the village cadres stubbornly protected their own group and refused to struggle against them. They struggled against two military dependents (landlord Wei Lanru and Wei Huaniang) and a demobilized soldier, Wei Xianfu (of poor peasant background). Wei Lanru was a cadre from a landlord background. Dissatisfied with the struggle against his family, he and Wei Huaniang invited Old Wei, Wei Xianfu, Wei Jingshun (a poor peasant who had also just returned from the army), and others to go to the county to file a complaint. The purpose was to avoid being struggled against or to lessen the struggle. Old Wei reviewed his own actions, admitting that he did not fully recognize their landlord faces at the time. But he was not complaining about the wrongful struggle against the military dependents and landlords, but about the fact that the poor and hired peasants could not participate in the farmers' association and were oppressed by the landlord-controlled village cadres and could not stand up. The county leadership did not distinguish between him and Wei Lanru, uniformly viewing it as factional struggle. They instructed the district to allow them to present their views at a mass meeting to clarify the rights and wrongs. They only said that Old Wei could participate in the farmers' association. When the district chief spoke to the village cadres, he met with great resistance. Then, the village held a mass meeting. They (Wei Lanru was not present) brought up the crimes and errors of the village cadres. The struggle began to intensify. These landlord elements decided to retaliate with the most vicious means. The first step was to use the contradictions between the district cadres (at that time, Wei Jintang had been transferred to the county) to attack District Chief Wang, who advocated supporting Old Wei. The village cadres reported to Deputy District Chief Xi, saying that District Chief Wang allowed landlords and struggle targets to participate in the farmers' association to rectify the cadres, and that the internal struggle in the village could not be carried out. According to District Chief Wang, Guo Quanyou had severely criticized him, questioning him, \"What's going on?\" The second step was to detain Old Wei, Wei Xianfu, and Wei Huaniang, and buy off Wei Jingshun, who had filed the complaint with Old Wei, threatening Jingshun, saying that Old Wei and Lanru were special agents, and asking him whether he wanted to follow feudalism or the masses. They also said that if he confessed, there would be no problem with dividing houses and land. Wei Jingshun wavered, saying that Wei Lanru said on the way that if it could not be resolved, he would take the militia's guns. Wei Jingwu, the director of the military committee, and Wei Jingsheng, the village chief, attributed Lanru's words to Old Wei's head, announcing to the masses that Old Wei wanted to take the militia's guns and was a special agent. They forced them to confess who they were organizing and where the Kuomintang certificate and guns were. If they did not admit it, they would be detained and beaten, put on a bench, their legs tied with ropes and bricks placed under their heels, to the point where seven bricks were piled up, their toes as high as their eyebrows, and they nearly died several times. They forced Old Wei's cousin, Wei Miliang, to say at the meeting that Old Wei wanted to murder him, forcing him four or five times. If he did not say it, they said he wanted to follow the special agents. The bad cadres tried to kill them several times, but did not succeed because District Chief Wang forbade it. Later, they used the excuse that the masses demanded action and insisted on holding a meeting. District Chief Wang discovered this conspiracy and ordered it to stop. They even said, \"You are afraid of struggling against special agents, you are timid!\" District Chief Wang insisted, \"Whoever kills anyone is responsible!\" so there was no trouble. At the end of the year, the masses bailed them out. On the sixth day of the first lunar month, Old Wei's son, Wei Ziyi, was again detained by the village cadres because he helped Wei Huaniang write a complaint against Wei Jintang and his gang, which they saw in the district. Wei Ziyi was hung up for three days and three nights. Unable to bear it, he escaped. They detained Old Wei and Wei Xianfu again. Wei Ziyi also returned because he had nowhere to run. At this time, Wei Jintang had been renamed the joint school principal. The county leadership found out that he was indeed a landlord, a puppet township head... and expelled him from the Party and squeezed him back to the village to be struggled against. In order to deceive the district and the masses, the village cadres also formally swept him out the door, but politically he was not defeated. The village cadres were still secretly colluding with him. After Wei Jintang was struggled against, his hatred for Wei Ziyi deepened. Not long after, a poisoning incident occurred at the No. 2 High School in the county. The \"culprit\" was found to be Wei Xinyue (Wei Hua's younger brother) from Xisuzhuang. Wei Xinyue did not admit that he was the one who poisoned. Teacher Han Shangtian (a landlord) led the students to hang him up and beat him, saying that three or four letters had already come from your village, why haven't you confessed yet? They lured and threatened him to implicate Wei Lanru and Wei Ziyi as the ones who gave him the poison. The principal wrote a letter back to the village, and the village cadres used this to hang up and beat Wei Ziyi, forcing him to confess. At the mass meeting, they made Wei Ziyi crawl like a dog. Although Wei Jintang was already a struggle target, when Wei Ziyi escaped, he was still able to write a note to send militiamen to catch him. Old Wei and his son and Wei Xianfu were not released until February 19th. Old Wei and Wei Xianfu's demobilization certificates were confiscated, and they were all swept out the door. Even Old Wei's brother, Wei Dianchen, was swept out the door. Old Wei's family had only one dou of rice and two dou of buckwheat, and Wei Dianchen's family had only one bag of grain, and they were all about to starve. They were forced to do hard labor for the landlord elements and were not allowed to talk to anyone. In this way, when the villagers saw Wei Dianhua's experience, everyone was afraid to say anything. The arrogance of the landlord elements reached its extreme. It was only after Wei Dianhua's problem was clarified this time that the masses began to raise their heads.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 魏殿花遭迫害经过  地主分子利用县区官僚主义，钻进支部政权，农民受打击的缩影。\n\n1948-02-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　魏殿花遭迫害经过\n    地主分子利用县区官僚主义，钻进支部政权，农民受打击的缩影。\n    雇贫出身的魏殿花同志在日本投降后，看到自己村里以魏锦堂为首的一伙地主、汉奸把持村政，斗争了魏见心、魏春良、魏殿魁等贫雇，曾带领敌人来村打死三个民兵的敌探曲裕夫，反而参加了农会，分斗争果实。村书记是当过伪警察的富农魏锦明，他很气愤，便正面和村干部顶撞。村干看到老魏替农民打不平，于是开始向老魏进攻；有一次强迫一破落富农魏之连诬赖老魏与他合卖了一个布蓬，进而说他包庇地主。但老魏并未因此退缩，他反对“选”坏人魏景武当武委会主任，后来又在群众大会上揭穿村长魏景升是地主魏锦堂个人指定的，他们俩个就都把老魏看成了眼中钉。次年五月，老魏因年老残废，复员回家。他到分区时报告了本村的严重情况，分区写信叫他和县上谈，县上又写信叫他和区上谈，他向区政委郭全有提出伪军敌探参加农会，当了干部。许多贫雇反而关在农会门外，但郭全有不到村里调查，反听信了魏锦堂及其他干部的话，认为老魏好走上层路线，和村干有私人成见。连党的关系也不替他介绍回家。魏锦堂又回村挑拨说：“老魏到县上区上告你们，要不是我，看你们吃得消吧！”使全体村干对老魏都非常仇恨。老魏回村接不上党的关系，连农会也不能参加，就去找郭全有，郭全有总是含糊推诿。到第三次，才介绍回村。虽然支部被地主把持仍然不吸收他参加党的会议，老魏却按月向党交纳党费。土地改革开始，该村斗争了一些与这些坏村干没有直接关系的地主富农。老魏虽然没有能参加农会，但对斗争却很积极。村干逼不得已，只好分给他一座院子、十五亩地（当时是按问题分果实）。但是老魏并未因此妥协，继续要求贫雇都参加农会，驱逐伪军破落地主出农会，他又到县提两次意见，没有结果，他于是在最贫苦的贫雇中活动，想把他们组织起来。此时群众要求继续斗争，村干死包庇住自己这一伙不斗，斗了两户军属（地主魏兰如、魏花娘），又斗了复员军人魏贤福（贫农成份），魏兰如是个地主出身的干部，因家庭被斗不满，他和魏花娘邀老魏、魏贤福、魏景顺（贫农，也是才从部队回来的）等同去县上告状，目的是想不斗或轻斗自己，老魏自己检讨，当时对他们的地主面目认识不足。但他告的不是错斗了军属地主，而是贫雇不能参加农会，受地主掌握的村干压迫不能翻身，县领导上没有区别他与魏兰如的不同，一律看成是宗派斗争。指示区可让他们在群众大会上提竟见，以辩明是非。只说了句可让老魏参加农会，区长向村干谈时，便遇很大抵抗。接着，村里召开群众大会，他们（魏兰如不在了）把村干的罪恶错误都提出来了，斗争开始尖锐，这些地主分子们决定以最毒狠的手段实行报复。第一步是利用区干部之间的矛盾（当时魏锦堂已调到县）打击主张为老魏撑腰的王区长。村干向席副区长会报，说王区长让地主、斗争对象参加农会来整干部，村内斗争已无法进行。据王区长说郭全有曾严厉批评他。质问他“怎么搞的？”第二步是把老魏、魏贤福、魏花娘都扣起来，收买了与老魏一道告状的魏景顺，威胁景顺说老魏与兰如是特务，问他是跟封建走是跟群众走？又说坦白了分房分地不成问题。魏景顺动摇了，说魏兰如路上说解决不了就下民兵的枪。武委会主任魏景武、村长魏景升就把兰如说的话按到老魏头上，向群众宣布老魏要下民兵枪，是特务。逼他们坦白组织的谁？国民党证和枪在哪里？不承认就扣押起来吊打、上板凳，腿上捆着绳子脚跟垫砖，垫到七块脚尖与眉毛一般高断气死去几次。威逼老魏堂弟魏米良到大会上说老魏想谋害他，逼了四五次，不说就说他想跟特务走。坏干部几次企图害死他们，因王区长不准未达目的。后又借口群众要求处理，硬要开会，王区长发现这一阴谋，命令停止。他们竟说：“你害怕斗争特务，你胆小！”王区长坚持“谁害死谁负责！”才没有出乱子。年底群众把他们保出来。正月初六老魏儿子魏子义，又被村干扣起来了，因他帮魏花娘写状告魏锦堂一伙，这状在区上被他们看见了。魏子义被吊了三天三夜，吃不住逃跑，他们把老魏和魏贤福又扣起来，魏子义因无处跑也回来了。此时魏锦堂已改任联合校长，县领导上查明他确系地主，伪大乡长……，把他开除党籍挤回村来斗争。村干为了欺哄区上和群众，形式上也扫地出门了，但政治上并未被斗垮，村干暗地仍在和他勾搭。魏锦堂被斗之后，对魏子义仇恨更深。以后不久该县二高就发生了特务放毒事件。查出“凶手”是西苏庄魏鑫岳（魏花之弟），魏鑫岳不承认是他放毒。教员韩尚田（地主）领导学生吊打他，说你们村里已经来了三四封信，还不坦白？诱骗、威胁他咬出魏兰如、魏子义给的他毒药，校长写信回村，村干就依此吊打魏子义，逼他坦白，在群众大会上要魏子义学狗爬，魏锦堂虽然已经是斗争对象，但当魏子义逃跑时，他却还能写条子派民兵去捉。老魏父子和魏贤福到二月十九才被放出来，老魏和魏贤福的复员证都被没收了，他们都被扫地出门了，连老魏哥哥魏殿臣也被扫地出门了。老魏家只有一斗米两斗荞麦，魏殿臣家只有一布袋谷，很快都要挨饿。他们被罚给地主分子做苦工，不准和人说话。这样，全村农民们看到魏殿花的遭遇，大家都不敢吭气了，地主分子气焰高涨到达极点，只是这次魏殿花问题弄清楚后，群众才算开始抬起头来。"

This village has a total of 15.4 \"qing\" of land, and one catty of rice is collected per \"mu.\" It is said that if this is not enough, they plan to sell fruit trees, which will be even more wasteful. For instance, in Xiaohuo Village, some families didn't even have enough to eat and borrowed rice from middle-income peasant families because of the rice collection for staging the opera.

    "content": "Battle Situation for the Week of the 19th to the 25th: In the past week, good news has been frequently reported from the Liberated Army on the northern and southern fronts. Seven cities have been captured in succession, and more than 24,000 enemy troops have been eliminated.\n\n　　On the Northeast front, on the 19th alone, the Liberated Army captured the two poles of the Shenyang outer defense system - \"Steel City\" Anshan and Faku. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 20,000 enemies were wiped out in the two places, including the entire 25th Division of the 52nd Army, the entire Provisional 62nd Division of the U.S.-equipped New 6th Army, and a part of the traffic police and mine police. Dozens of enemy officers above the rank of colonel, including deputy division commanders and regimental and battalion commanders, were captured. Now the Liberated Army has cut off the retreat of the Chiang bandit in Shenyang from the south, making the Chiang bandit's precarious nest in Shenyang even more isolated. At present, only a few isolated points remain on the periphery of Shenyang, including Fushun in the east, Tieling in the north, Xinmin in the west, and Benxi in the southeast. The Wei Lihuang and Chiang bandit troops have been trapped in this area of ​​no more than a hundred li and are facing the fate of annihilation. Under the Liberated Army's thunderous offensive, the dying Chiang bandit was completely devoid of humanity and used poison gas bombs in the battle of Shifosi. The spokesperson of the Northeast Liberated Army Command has issued a serious warning. If the Chiang bandit continues such atrocities, the Liberated Army will be forced to take resolute revenge. At the same time, in the wake of the Chiang bandit's disastrous defeat in the Northeast, it has recently attempted to use a group of old Northeast warlord bureaucrats to help support the precarious situation. Obviously, the result will only be to add a few more burial objects to the Northeast Chiang bandit. All these have shown that the Northeast Chiang bandit has reached a dead end.\n\n　　On the Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui fronts, the Liberated Army and the local armed forces of Ji, Lu, and Yu captured the two county towns of Lanfeng and Minquan on the Longhai Line again on the 18th and 19th. In the Lanfeng battle, the headquarters of the 119th Brigade of the Chiang Bandit's 68th Division and all of its 356th Regiment were wiped out, and a total of more than 1,600 people, including the pseudo-county magistrate of Lanfeng, were captured. On the 19th, our army intercepted the enemy fleeing from Kaocheng to Kaifeng and captured more than 100 of them. On the same day, the local armed forces of Yu, Anhui, and Su captured Zhecheng again, annihilating more than 500 enemy troops. The local armed forces in various sub-districts actively eliminated local Chiang bandits in the areas of Woyang, Fuyang, Huaiyang, Tongxu, and Chenliu. From the end of last month to the beginning of this month, more than 600 of them have been wiped out.\n\n　　On the Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei fronts, our military region troops and local armed forces attacked the enemy everywhere. The troops of the Jianghan Military Region captured the two cities of Yingshan and Anlu on the 15th and 17th respectively, capturing more than 500 enemy troops below the rank of battalion commander. The troops of the Western Anhui Military Region ambushed the enemy harassing the area in Qingcaoge and Guachehe, southwest of Tongcheng, on the 8th, killing more than 200 of them. Since the 8th, the local armed forces of the 3rd and 5th sub-districts of Henan, Shaanxi, and Hubei have wiped out more than 1,000 local Chiang bandits in the areas of Luanchuan, Yiyang, and Songxian.\n\n　　On the East China front, the local armed forces of Central China advanced into the Chiang bandit-occupied areas to fight in the first ten days of this month and smashed the Chiang bandit's partial \"mopping-up\" operations in Huaibei, capturing more than ten strongholds, including Yantou, two li north of Taixing, and the Xinyi Harbor, Xieqiao, and Beifurong west of Xinghua, and eliminating 1,700 enemy troops. Our local armed forces in Jiaodong are active in the suburbs of the enemy's isolated strongholds of Yantai and Longkou. On the 7th and 8th, they destroyed the pseudo-organizations in 17 villages on the periphery of Yantai City and surrounded Longkou on three sides.\n\n　　The Northwest Liberated Army has formally established a sub-district in the Huanglong Mountain area, forming a pincer attack on the Hu bandits together with the increasingly expanding Guanzhong sub-district, and becoming a powerful forward position for liberating the Great Northwest.

    "content": "Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls for\n  Correct Interpretation of \"Equal Distribution,\" Immediately Begin Spring Plowing\n    [Taihang News] The spring plowing season has arrived, but in many villages, farmers misunderstand \"equal distribution\" to mean \"disruptive equal distribution,\" fearing wasted labor and losses, so they are unwilling to start work, waiting until after the distribution. Therefore, the Taihang Xinhua Daily specially calls on all farmers in the region to quickly organize the delivery of manure and repair the land. The article first points out that the \"equal distribution\" mentioned in the Land Law Outline does not mean disruptive equal distribution, but rather drawing from fertile to supplement barren, and drawing from surplus to supplement deficit. It then points out that some villages in our region, after years of emancipation movements, have seen many hired laborers or the majority of hired laborers, roughly achieving the village's average acreage and average grain yield. This time, the distribution of land will use the method of drawing and supplementing to level out the discrepancies, allowing hired laborers who have not been fully emancipated to reach the village's average acreage and average grain yield; therefore, the land will not only not be disruptively redistributed, but the changes will also not be very significant. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will dispel the misunderstanding of \"disruptive equal distribution.\" Finally, it points out that spring is early this year, and the \"Rain Water\" solar term has already arrived. If manure is not delivered and land is not repaired quickly to prepare for spring plowing, it will definitely affect this year's production. If production is poor, it is oneself who will suffer. Therefore, we suggest that the masses be quickly organized to deliver manure, repair land, and prepare for spring plowing. Landlords and rich peasants must also be made to apply manure well and repair the land well.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行新华日报号召　正确解释“平分”  立即着手春耕\n\n1948-02-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行新华日报号召\n  　正确解释“平分”  立即着手春耕\n    【太行消息】春耕季节已到，但有不少村庄的农民，因对“平分”误解是“打乱平分”，怕白误工又赔本，所以都不愿意动工，等平分后再说。为此太行新华日报特号召全区农民应赶快组织送粪、修地。该文首先指出：土地法大纲所说的平分，它的办法不是打乱平分，而是抽肥补瘦、抽多补少。接着指出：我区有些村庄经过历年翻身运动，很多雇贫或者大部分雇贫，在土地上大体已达到了全村的平均亩数和平均产粮，这次平分土地，就是用抽补的办法来填平补齐，让没翻透身的雇贫，达到全村平均亩数和平均产粮就行；所以土地不但不打乱平分，而且变动也不会很大。所以希望大家取消“打乱平分”的误解。最后指出：今年春浅，目前已到“雨水”节，如不赶快送粪、修地等准备春耕，定要影响今年生产。生产不好，吃亏的还是自己。所以我们建议，要赶快组织群众送粪、修地，准备春耕工作。地主富农也一定要他把粪上好、地修好。"

The strength of the working masses and the democratic forces of our country is so great that they are fully capable of crushing the conspiracy of the reactionaries. In my capacity as Prime Minister, I tell you that the government remains at its post and will realize the will of the working people. The government will do everything in its power to fulfill the demands of the working people, maintain and consolidate the people's democratic system, and prepare for free and democratic elections.\" The last sentence of Gottwald's speech was drowned out by thunderous applause and roaring cheers. The entire venue shouted, \"Long live the new Gottwald government! Long live our best friend, the Soviet Union!\" The congress resolved to hold a one-hour national warning strike on the 24th to express support for the Gottwald government. Additionally, people across Czechoslovakia have been continuously holding mass rallies and demonstrations for days, demanding that President Beneš accept the resignation of the ministers from the three reactionary parties and establish a new government of people's democracy. The government has received thousands of resolutions and letters from the people expressing their support for days.\n\n　　Moscow dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: An international observer in Pravda commented on the 22nd on the situation in Czechoslovakia: The anti-democratic conspiracy of international reactionary forces is intensifying as the Czech elections approach. Reactionary forces are using certain parties that have infiltrated the coalition government as tools, and the National Socialist Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party, three parties participating in the National Front, have become shelters for those who harbor anti-people views and purposes. The observer pointed out the reasons for the resignation of the three party ministers: The considerable achievements of people's democracy and the victorious progress of the Two-Year Plan, the increasing prestige of the Communist Party, and the Gottwald government's pursuit of saboteurs filled all the running dogs of reactionary forces with panic, fearing exposure of their relationship with the country's enemies abroad. Therefore, at the cabinet meeting, the three party ministers refused to listen to the reports from the Minister of Interior and the Minister of National Defense on the cracking of the Most espionage system. The three parties jointly participated in the conspiracy against the Czech National Front, and their resignation was in accordance with orders from abroad, attempting to cause a government crisis with this irresponsible behavior. The observer judged that the conspiracy of international reactionary forces is doomed to fail because the Czech people have shown that they will not tolerate the slightest compromise with treasonous policies. They demand that the agents of reactionary forces, the enemies of the National Front, be purged from the government. Hundreds of thousands of workers, staff, and peasants unanimously support the Gottwald government. The Czech people are determined to oppose all reactionary conspiracies and defend the Republic.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 捷克八千职工代表欢呼万岁　拥护捷共领导新政府  国际反动势力反民主阴谋注定失败\n\n1948-02-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　捷克八千职工代表欢呼万岁\n  　拥护捷共领导新政府\n    国际反动势力反民主阴谋注定失败\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】布拉格讯：代表捷克各大工厂、矿山、机关二百五十万工人和职员的职工会全国代表大会，二十二日在此间举行，大会八千名代表以极兴奋的心情听取捷共主席内阁总理哥特瓦尔德向大会的演说。他指出：“只有劳动人民才有权决定什么东西符合共和国的利益。国内和国外的反动派企图破坏我国人民民主政权，把政府交给反动政客，让共和国退回到慕尼黑以前的黑暗统治。然而这是绝对办不到的，劳动大众的力量，我们国家的民主力量是如此强大，他们完全能够粉碎反动派的阴谋。我以总理的身份告诉你们，政府仍然坚持自己的岗位，并将实现劳动人民的意志。政府将尽其一切努力，履行劳动人民的要求，保持与巩固人民民主制度；并筹备自由民主的选举”。哥氏演说的最后一句话，为群众雷动的掌声与如潮的欢呼所淹没。全场高呼“哥特瓦尔德新政府万岁！我们最好的朋友苏联万岁！”大会决议二十四日举行全国警告罢工一小时，表示对哥特瓦尔德政府的支持。又：全捷各地人民连日不断举行群众集会与示威游行，要求贝奈斯总统接受三反动政党各部长的辞职，成立人民民主的新政府。政府连日收到人民表示拥护的决议与信件数以千计。\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家于二十二日评捷克局势说：国际反动势力的反民主阴谋，随着捷克大选临近而加紧。反动势力利用钻入联合政府的某些党派作为工具，而民族社会党、基督教人民党和斯洛伐克民主党三个参加民族阵线的党派，成了那些暗藏反人民观点和目的者的避难所。观察家指出三党部长辞职的原因说：人民民主可观的成就和两年计划胜利的进行，共产党声望的增高，哥特瓦尔德政府对破坏分子的追究，使一切反动势力的走狗，充满了惊慌，唯恐暴露出自己与国外共和国公敌的关系，所以在内阁会议上，三党部长拒绝听取内政部长和国防部长关于破获莫斯特城间谍系统的报告。三党共同参加了反对捷克民族阵线的阴谋，他们的辞职是遵循国外的命令，企图以这种不负责任的行为引起政府的危机。观察家判断：国际反动势力的阴谋注定要失败的，因为捷克人民表明了决不容许和叛国政策有丝毫妥协的立场。他们要求把反动势力的代理人，民族阵线的敌人，清除出政府。成千成万工人职员和农民一致拥护哥特瓦尔德政府。捷克人民决心反对一切反动阴谋，保卫共和国。"

    "content": "Joint Notice from Xin Dazhong Newspaper and the Postal Administration to all Post Office Station Masters:\n\nThe Xin Dazhong newspaper's announcement in Issue 7 regarding the price increase for the March newspaper was published too late and without prior consultation with the Postal Administration. Local post offices have already begun subscribing to the March newspaper, making it difficult to collect additional fees. To facilitate distribution and avoid procedural chaos, we have re-negotiated and decided that the price of Xin Dazhong newspaper will increase starting from April, to 350 yuan per copy per month. From March 1st, all subscriptions for April or later newspapers will be charged at the new price of 350 yuan. However, subscriptions for the March newspaper will be charged at the original price of 200 yuan, regardless of when they are made, and will not be increased (any overpayment based on the new price should be refunded to the subscriber). Specific regulations are as follows:\n\n\tI. All subscriptions for April or later newspapers made in January and February will be honored and no additional fees will be collected based on the new price.\n\tII. However, from March 1st, if any subscriptions for April or later newspapers are still made at the old price (200 yuan), the difference should be collected at the new price (350 yuan). You must patiently explain the reasons to subscribers, work diligently, and be responsible for collecting the additional fees, with a deadline of March 20th for reporting to the newspaper.\n\tIII. For subscriptions to the March newspaper or subscriptions to April and later newspapers that were already made at the new price before March 1st due to receiving the Xin Dazhong Issue 7 price increase announcement, all overpayments should be fully refunded to the subscribers, with an explanation of the reason.\n\tIV. All post office stations are prohibited from falsely reporting subscription periods, overcharging, or failing to refund money that should be refunded. Violators will be subject to punishment.\n\tV. Accounting procedures for collecting and refunding newspaper fees:\n\t\tA. When refunding overpaid newspaper fees, the subscriber should provide a receipt stating \"Received from the post office ×× yuan for overpaid Xin Dazhong newspaper subscription for ×× month,\" stamped with the subscriber's seal. When collecting additional fees, a receipt should be given to the subscriber. All procedures must be completed by March 20th.\n\t\tB. Prepare three lists each for collected and refunded newspaper fees, indicating the month, number of copies, amount collected, and amount refunded. Send one copy to the General Administration, one to the Regional Administration, and one to the newspaper for reconciliation. Send the subscriber's receipts to the General Administration for verification.\n\t\tC. For those who pay newspaper fees using four-part vouchers, the General Administration will verify and correct them. For those who remit newspaper fees by bank draft, each post office should contact the newspaper directly to settle overpayments and underpayments.\n\nUpon receiving this notice, all post office stations should act accordingly.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: New York dispatch: American progressive forces vehemently oppose the US government's aid-to-Chiang bill. Wallace declared in New York on the 23rd that Truman's aid-to-Chiang plan is a provocation of war, a new stage of American financial and political intervention in China, and a support for a reactionary government that goes against the will of the Chinese people. He refuted Truman's deceptive argument of \"peace and economic assistance,\" saying, \"The purpose of this assistance is not to buy necessities for the Chinese people, but to provide funds for the Kuomintang to purchase weapons and ammunition.\" He said that this new loan only benefits Wall Street groups, which hope to control a large part of the Chinese economy and profit from China's cheap labor. Wallace listed the facts of American military intervention in China: 1,000 American officers are helping the Kuomintang train ten divisions of troops, giving the Chinese (Chiang) government 271 warships and a large number of aircraft; the United States is secretly establishing bases in Qingdao and Taiwan, and the US fleet is constantly patrolling the Chinese waters. He said that the United States has exhausted $4 billion in aiding Chiang and has thus lost the friendship of the Chinese people. He called for the withdrawal of all American financial and military intervention in China, pointing out that the development of the current situation in China has proved that \"America's current diplomacy is bound to fail.\"\n\nThe American Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, reported on the US State Department's aid-to-Chiang plan on the 19th, saying that Truman's poorly disguised so-called \"non-military assistance\" is actually a step for the United States to \"intervene in Chiang's repeatedly defeated anti-communist war.\"\n\nAlso, from Washington: Ms. Russell, the executive director of the American Committee for a Democratic Policy toward China, and other leaders of the committee, specially hosted a press conference in Washington on the 22nd to \"launch an off-parliamentary movement against the aid-to-Chiang bill.\" Russell revealed that \"the background of the aid-to-Chiang plan is Wall Street financiers, and Truman and Marshall have to obey their orders.\" She condemned the US government for \"deliberately distorting the truth of the Chinese situation and confusing the American people,\" and urged the cancellation of this plan.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Washington dispatch: The US government has officially admitted to continuously aiding Chiang's civil war with military arms. According to the US State Department's announcement on the 21st, an agreement was signed with the Chiang bandit gang on January 31 to sell a large amount of surplus military materials from the Mariana Islands to the Chiang bandit gang at a low price of 17.5% of the cost; on February 18, the Chiang bandit gang accepted 22 surplus ships from the United States, worth a total of 10 million US dollars. Last December, the Chiang bandit gang also obtained 99 ships from the United States \"free of charge\" and 150 transport aircraft at only 2% of the price (according to reports, the latter two transactions were exchanged by the Chiang bandit gang for the sale of naval and air force supervision rights).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杜鲁门援蒋挑拨战争丧失了中国人民友谊  华莱士等反对军事干涉中国\n\n1948-02-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　杜鲁门援蒋挑拨战争丧失了中国人民友谊\n    华莱士等反对军事干涉中国\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】纽约讯：美国进步力量激烈反对美政府援蒋法案。华莱士二十三日在纽约宣称：杜鲁门的援华（蒋）计划就是挑拨战争，是美国在财政和政治上干涉中国的新阶段，是支持违反中国人民意志的反动政府。他驳斥杜鲁门“和平及经济援助”的欺骗论调说：“这种援助的目的并不是替中国人民购买必需物资，而是作为国民党购买武器和弹药的资金。”他说：这笔新贷款只是与华尔街集团有利，华尔街集团希望控制大部分中国经济，并且从中国廉价的劳动力中取利。华莱士列举美国军事干涉中国的事实说：一千名美国军官正在帮助国民党训练十师军队，给了中国（蒋）政府二百七十一艘战舰和大批飞机；美国秘密在青岛及台湾建立基地，美舰队不断在中国海面巡弋。他说，美国在援蒋中已耗尽四十亿美元，并因此丧失了中国人民的友谊。他呼吁撤退美国在华一切财政和军事干涉，指出中国目前情势的发展，已证明“美国现行外交必然失败”。\n    美共机关报工人日报于十九日报导美国务院援蒋计划时说：杜鲁门伪装得很差的所谓“非军事援助”，实际上是美国“插足蒋方屡战屡败的反共战争”的一个步骤。\n    又讯：美国对华民主政策委员会行政主任罗素女士及该会其他领袖，为“发动一反对援华（蒋）法案的国会会外运动”，特于二十二日在华盛顿招待记者，罗素揭露说：“援华（蒋）计划的背景是华尔街的财政家，杜鲁门和马歇尔都要服从他们的命令。”她谴责美政府“故意歪曲中国情势的真象，迷惑美国人民”，并敦促取消此项计划。\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】华盛顿消息：美国政府已正式供认不断以军火武器援蒋内战。据美国务院二十一日宣布：一月三十一日曾与蒋匪缔结协定，以成本百分之十七点五的低廉价格将马里亚纳群岛大批剩余军用物资售与蒋匪；二月十八日蒋匪曾接受美国二十二艘剩余舰艇，总值一千万美元。去年十二月蒋匪也曾从美国“无价”获得九十九艘船只和只付百分之二价格的一百五十架运输机（按后两笔系蒋匪以出卖海军和空军监督权换得者）。"

    "content": "“Forgetting the Pain Once the Sore Heals”\n  　Cui Ziyu Reflects on the Ideology of Forgetting One's Roots\n    (A poor peasant from Huixian County. He joined the Party in 1944 and immediately began working. He is currently the chairman of the Rescue Association in X district of Xinxiang.)\n\n    As far as I can remember, my family relied on two mattocks and a hoe to reclaim wasteland and rent land for a living. I herded cattle at ten and lived as a hired hand at fifteen. Later, I carried loads to make a living. My grandfather and father were both hired hands all their lives, earning nothing. The whole family couldn't get enough to eat or wear. However, my class consciousness was very poor. In 1944, when rent reduction was implemented, I felt that I had offended the landlords and was a little worried. I wanted to find someone to rely on, so I joined the Party. When I first started working, I was very enthusiastic, but later I slowly forgot about my class brothers and started planning for myself. After being assigned to work in Xinxiang, I saw that other people dressed better and were wealthier than me, so I used the money from confiscating ammunition for rewards to buy a blanket. I wanted to equip myself in all aspects. Because I was eager to solve the marriage problem, I even shielded a landlord woman.\n\n    In my work, administrative orders were very severe. I only blindly worked alone, without motivating everyone. When I worked in Liuzan City, it was said to be a bunker village, and the situation had to be opened up within twenty days. At that time, it was the busy farming season. In order to complete the plan, I ordered that the land be planted in a five-day blitz, planting during the day and holding meetings until midnight at night, non-stop, completely disregarding the fatigue of the masses. My work followed the route of village cadres and activists. Regardless of their class background, as long as they were active and dared to work, it was fine. I only saw that the village chief, Yang Xiufu, was active and listened to him in everything, without consulting with the masses. In Fancun, I forced the masses to prepare for war, ordering \"whoever doesn't evacuate is not allowed.\" Without the masses' ideological awareness, I forced them to leave their homes. If Dongfancun didn't prepare for war, I sent carts from other villages to Xifancun to pull things, stimulating Dongfancun to prepare for war.\n\n    In the past, I did not recognize these serious mistakes. The comrades in the district criticized me for having a Kuomintang style, but I did not accept it and did not humbly engage in self-criticism. I even complained that the Party did not take care of me. I always thought that I had suffered outside for several years and had lost out. I only compared myself to the backward and did not compare myself to the progressive comrades.\n\n    After studying, I deeply realized that it was not that the Party did not trust me, but that I had let down the Party and the masses. I had forgotten my roots after being emancipated. Recalling that my family had been poor for generations, my father, mother, and brothers ate leaves and starved during famine years. Now my family has food and clothing, and we have also harvested wheat, and our life is very good. I \"forgot the pain once the sore healed\" and didn't want to engage in revolution anymore, forgetting about the many poor and hired peasants who had no food or drink. I feel really sorry for the oppressed class brothers. Now I understand, and I am determined to serve the poor and hired peasants.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “疮好忘了疼”　崔子玉反省忘本思想\n\n1948-02-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“疮好忘了疼”\n  　崔子玉反省忘本思想\n    （辉县人，贫农成份，四四年入党后即参加工作，现任新乡×区救联会主席。）\n    我记事时，家里靠两把钁头，一把锄头开山荒，租种地生活。我十岁放牛，十五岁住长工，后来担脚赶嘴，我祖父、父亲都是住一辈长工，啥也没赚下。全家老小吃不饱穿不暖。可是我的阶级觉悟却很差。四四年减租觉得把大户都得罪下了，自己有点担心，想找个靠头，就这样参加了党。才出来工作很热情，后来慢慢的有些忘掉阶级弟兄，为个人打算起来了。分配到新乡工作后，看人家穿的都比自己强，比自己富裕，就拿没收子弹提奖的钱买了个毯子。想在各方面装备自己。因为急着解决婚姻问题，自己还包庇了一个地主女人。\n    在工作中，行政命令很厉害，光一个人盲干，也不推动大家。到六赞城工作时，说是碉堡村，二十天一定要打开局面，当时正是农忙时候，我为完成计划，就下命令五天突击种完地，白天种地，黑夜开会开到半夜，昼夜不停，根本不顾群众疲劳。工作是走的村干积极分子路线，不管成份如何，只要积极敢干就行，光看见村长杨秀甫积极，一切听他话办事，也不和群众商量。在凡村强迫群众备战，下命令“谁不转移不行”，不通过群众思想自觉，逼迫群众离家。东凡村不备战，就派他村的大车给西凡村拉东西，这样来刺激东凡村备战。\n    过去我对这些严重错误都不认识，区上同志批评我是国民党作风，我不接受，不虚心去自我批评，还埋怨党不照顾自己。总认为自己在外受罪好几年，是赔了本啦，光向落后看齐，不与进步的同志比。\n    经过学习，才深刻认识到，不是党不相信自己，是自己对不起党，对不起群众，自己是翻了身忘了本。回想自己家辈辈受穷，灾荒年父亲、母亲兄弟吃树叶饿肚，现在我家有吃、有穿，还打下麦子，生活很好，自己就“疮好忘了疼”，不想干革命了，把许多没吃没喝的贫雇群众忘干净了。我感到实在对不起受压迫的阶级弟兄，现在我想通了，我一定决心为贫雇服务。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th: The Bohai area's Yellow River ice flood, which began on the 7th of this month, has been turned from danger to safety by the 13th after active rescue efforts. For nearly a week, all party, government, military, men, women, old and young along the river were mobilized to rescue day and night. At the most critical moment, the military region commander personally led the artillery and military industrial blasting team to break the ice with heavy artillery and explosions. Staff members of the Provincial River Affairs Bureau sailed boats to rescue the masses and led them to break the ice and dredge the water. The masses also used their own bedding and straw to block the breaches in the dam. In the two-mile section at the junction of Putai and Lijin alone, the materials used were worth more than 810,000 North Sea currency (each yuan equivalent to 25 yuan of Chiang currency). Now the ice has melted and the river is flowing into the sea, and the danger has passed.\n    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: On the 7th of this month, the returning Yellow River's ice flood suddenly arrived, with torrents and ice piles like mountains, and washed down a large ice block of one square li. By the 11th, the water level had risen to 18.04 meters, which was 1.09 meters higher than the highest water level of 16.95 meters during last year's flood season. The whirlpool expanded, and breaches occurred in the river embankment, making the situation critical. The water depth around the city wall of Putai, which is twelve li away from the riverbed, submerged the top. The Hetao area and Chengguan area of Putai, Dongguan and other villages of Lijin, and more than 70 villages along the river in Bin County, Gaoyuan, Huimin, and Qingcheng were flooded because the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and Chiang Kai-shek bandits withheld the resettlement funds last year and failed to relocate them in time. Residents suffered heavy losses. Now the democratic government is actively carrying out rescue operations, and the disaster victims have all been rescued and are being resettled and relieved.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 经我军民昼夜抢救　渤海安度黄河凌泛\n\n1948-02-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　经我军民昼夜抢救\n  　渤海安度黄河凌泛\n    【新华社华东二十五日电】渤海区黄河凌泛泛滥，自本月七日起，经积极抢救，迄十三日已转危为安。在将近一周间，沿河党政军民男女老幼全部出动昼夜抢险，情况最紧张时，军区司令员亲率炮兵及军工爆炸队，用重炮和爆炸破冰，省河务局工作人员则驾船一面抢救群众，一面率领群众破冰疏水。群众并纷纷以自己被服草秸等堵塞大堤漏洞，仅蒲台、利津交界处两里的地段，所用即值北海币八十一万余元（每元合蒋币二十五元），现冰解河开，大水奔腾入海，危险已过。\n    【新华社华东二十四日电】本月七日，归故黄河凌泛突来，激流奔腾，积冰如山，并冲下一方里大的冰块。至十一日水位涨达一八·零四公尺，较去年伏泛最高水位一六·九五公尺，尚高出一·零九公尺。水涡扩大，河堤发生漏洞，形势危急，距河床十二里的蒲台城垣周围水深没顶。蒲台之河套区、城关区、利津之东关等村及滨县、高苑、惠民、青城境内沿河七十余村庄，因去年联总及蒋匪扣拨移民费，未得及时迁移，均惨遭水淹。居民损失重大，现民主政府正积极抢险中，灾民也已全部救出，并正分别安置和救济中。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Despite Truman's calls for aid to Chiang Kai-shek, prices in Shanghai continue to soar. According to news agency reports, although the 27 million USD in grain provided by the U.S. under the guise of \"relief\" has been successively shipped to Shanghai, and Truman submitted a 570 million USD aid-to-Chiang Kai-shek bill to the U.S. Congress on the 18th, with the U.S. State Department's detailed aid plan announced on the 20th including 225,000 tons of wheat and 450,000 tons of rice, Shanghai rice, U.S. dollars, and gold still reached all-time highs after the 18th. On the 20th, Shanghai rice rose to 2.2 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency per dan (unit of weight), and on the 21st, it rose again to 2.4 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency in a single day, an increase of 33% compared to two weeks prior near the Lunar New Year. The black market exchange rate for U.S. dollars reached 225,000 in Chiang Kai-shek currency on the 20th, and the upward trend became even more frenzied on the 23rd, \"with one U.S. dollar quoted at around 230,000 in the morning, rising every hour thereafter, reaching 270,000 by dusk\" (Reuters), an increase of 80% compared to two weeks prior. Gold reached 17 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency per tael, and Chinese and foreign stocks all rose, with prices of all goods exceeding the peak of the first price storm this year and marching forward rapidly. Reuters pointed out that the soaring prices were due to the disastrous defeats of Chiang's troops in the Northeast and \"the people's belief that no American loans could stop inflation.\" General observers have also pointed out that this wave of price increases has proven that Chiang Kai-shek's economic crisis is extremely profound and cannot be salvaged by any U.S. aid.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Shandong News: More than half of the businesses in Yantai have closed down due to Chiang Kai-shek's extortion. From October to December of last year alone, Chiang Kai-shek extorted 3.9 billion in Chiang Kai-shek currency in so-called \"self-defense expenses,\" and \"business tax\" has been levied seven times. In the most recent instance, large businesses were extorted as much as 100 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency, and small businesses had to hand over 10 million in Chiang Kai-shek currency. During the Gregorian New Year, Chiang Kai-shek forced businesses to provide 20 fat pigs and 15,000 kilograms of Chinese cabbage to comfort Chiang's troops. Chiang Kai-shek also forcibly purchased pork at 4,000 in Chiang Kai-shek currency per jin, while the market price was 50,000 in Chiang Kai-shek currency per jin. Since the Chiang Kai-shek gang occupied the Yantai market, more than 2,700 businesses have been forced to close, accounting for more than half of the original businesses. Even well-known flour factories such as Tianchengh和, 福聚, and 福兴和 have successively closed down. The lives of ordinary people are in desperate straits. Prostitutes who had been educated by the democratic government and turned to legitimate professions are now back on the streets in large numbers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: According to Chiang Kai-shek's newspapers: Chiang Kai-shek is shipping soybeans seized from the Northeast to Japan. In January, Chiang Kai-shek's delegation to Japan officially signed a contract to ship 20,000 tons of soybeans to Japan. Another contract for 30,000 tons is also being negotiated. Prior to the formal signing of the contract, more than 10,000 tons of soybeans had already been shipped to Japan.\n\nIn addition: Chiang Kai-shek is also planning to expand trade with South Korea under U.S. occupation. Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Economic Affairs is discussing methods with relevant agencies. Chiang-Korean trade began in June of last year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝援蒋声中上海物价猛涨　蒋匪经济危机没法挽救\n\n1948-02-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝援蒋声中上海物价猛涨\n  　蒋匪经济危机没法挽救\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】在杜鲁门援蒋声中，上海物价仍猛烈上涨。据各通讯社消息：美帝以“救济”名义援蒋之二千七百万美元粮食虽已陆续运沪，杜鲁门十八日亦已向美国会提出五亿七千万美元援蒋咨文，二十日美国务院发表之援蒋方案详细节目中包括二十二万五千吨小麦与四十五万吨大米，但十八日之后上海大米与美钞黄金，仍涨达有史以来之最高峰。二十日上海大米每担涨到蒋币二百二十万元，二十一日一日间又升为二百四十万元，较二周前临近旧历年关时涨了百分之三十三。美钞黑市二十日已涨达二十二万五千，二十三日涨势更疯狂，“当日晨美钞一元喊价二十三万元左右，此后每小时都有上升，到黄昏时已达二十七万元”（路透社），较二周前涨了百分之八十。黄金每两已达蒋币一千七百万，中外股票无不上涨，百物价格也超过今年第一次物价风暴高峰，在大步迈进中。路透社曾指出：物价狂涨原因为蒋军在东北惨败与“人民认为任何美国贷款都不可能制止通货膨胀”；一般观察家也均指出，此次涨风，已证明蒋匪经济危机极度深刻，决非任何美帝援助所能挽救。\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】山东讯：烟台商业在蒋匪勒索下已倒闭过半。去年仅十月到十二月蒋匪即勒索所谓“自卫经费”蒋币三十九亿元，“营业税”已征收七次，最近一次，大商号竟有被勒索一亿元者，小商号亦须交出一千万元。阳历年关时，蒋匪又迫令各商号以肥猪二十口、大白菜一万五千斤慰劳蒋匪军，蒋匪并以四千元强买市价五万元一斤的猪肉。自蒋匪帮侵占烟市至目前止，商号被迫停业者已有二千七百余家，占原有商号半数以上，即著名之天成和、福聚、福兴和等面粉工厂亦相继关门停业。一般人民生活均陷于绝境。过去经民主政府教育转入帮助正当职业的妓女现又大批踯躅街头。\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据蒋区报纸载：蒋匪以自东北掠得之大豆输日。一月间蒋匪驻日代表团与日政府正式签订二万吨大豆输日合同。另一批三万吨之合同亦在商订中。在合同正式签订前，输日之大豆已逾一万吨。\n    另悉：蒋匪亦筹谋与美帝占领下之南韩扩大贸易，蒋匪经济部正与各有关机关研议办法中，按蒋韩贸易系于去年六月开始。"

In the battles, they repeatedly created combat examples of preparing to grasp the situation, and launching flexible and bold attacks. For example, on the 3rd, over 200 enemy troops in Fushan raided the Liujiabu area. Our unit counterattacked from the front, and the militia explosive team coordinated from both sides, completely routing the enemy and annihilating more than 50 enemy troops. Also, on the 8th, over 100 enemy troops in the Yantai urban area raided the Wutai Village south of the city, on the 19th, more than 50 cavalrymen of the Bandit 8th Army raided Huangwu market southwest of Yantai, and on the 31st, over 70 enemy troops from Hanting in northeast Weixian raided.

The Haiyang stretcher team donated 260,000 yuan and 60,000 jin of grass from their own savings in vegetable money during the wounded soldier insulation campaign. Over 5,000 civilian laborers from Juxian and Junan counties in Binhai, were once ordered to transport military supplies 300 li away. It was stipulated that each person should carry a maximum of 60 jin, but everyone competed to carry more, averaging over 90 jin. During their three months of service, they mastered various military common sense, suffered no casualties, and seized the opportunity to study, starting with guns, stretchers, and each other's names, learning 100 to 300 new characters each. More than 3,000 civilian laborers from more than ten counties including Zouxian and Qufu in Southern Shandong, participated in more than ten major and minor battles successively, including Tai'an, Jining, Shashiji, Suxian, and Suining.

    "content": "Chiang Kai-shek's Treacherous Sale of China's New Twenty-One Demands\nChen Boda\n\nComrade Mao Zedong, in his recent revolutionary proclamation \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks,\" stated: \"The Chinese reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, are exactly like the running dog of Japanese imperialism, Wang Jingwei, acting as running dogs of American imperialism, selling China to the United States, launching war against the Chinese people, and preventing the advance of the Chinese people's liberation cause.\" Now, I am publishing this section of my draft \"Public Enemy Chiang Kai-shek\" in the newspaper for everyone to study as a reference to Comrade Mao Zedong's great revolutionary proclamation. Note by the author.\n\nThe social foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war is the feudal and comprador system, but the main force relied upon is external rather than internal. Without the aid of American imperialism to Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese people could have easily swept away this pile of garbage, the Chiang family dynasty. In order to maintain the tottering final dynasty of the great feudal slave owners and big foreign firm compradores, so that American imperialism could exclusively occupy China, American imperialists used all means to aid Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. On August 22, 1945, after Japan's surrender, Truman declared that all Lend-Lease contracts would no longer continue. However, in order to support Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people war, Truman went back on his word and announced on November 15 that the Lend-Lease program for the Kuomintang would be extended again. An editorial in the Shanghai *China Weekly Review* on December 21, 1946, introduced a pamphlet exposed by the American \"Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy\" regarding US imperialist activities in China, which included some general materials:\n\nThe committee's summary of the post-war Lend-Lease program is:\n\nAccording to the *New York Times* of September 27, 1945, the total amount of American surplus war materials in the India-Burma theater was US$500 million, all of which was sold to China. Among them, US$150 million of military supplies, including 700 aircraft, had already been transferred.\n\nAccording to Truman's report on the Lend-Lease program, the Nationalist government received a total of US$600.2 million in Lend-Lease materials from Japan's surrender to the end of 1945, including vehicles worth US$68.8 million and ammunition worth US$50 million.\n\nIn addition, the United States has repeatedly allowed the sale of surplus materials to China. One item was sold on July 30, 1946, for US$150 million. On August 31, 1946, surplus war materials from the Pacific Islands were sold for US$825 million.\n\nThe loans that the Export-Import Bank has granted to China are known to be two. One is US$560 million. According to the \"Wall Street Journal\" of November 29, 1945, two-thirds of this loan will be used up by the end of 1946. The other is a US$670 million loan for American cotton, which was published in a US Information Service announcement on September 12, 1946.\n\nIn mid-July 1946, 271 warships were sent to the Nationalist government.\n\nThe above is an incomplete estimate of the United States' military and financial aid to the Kuomintang government. However, several items are worth noting. The total number of Chinese troops equipped and trained by the United States is 22 armies, 57 divisions, totaling 700,700 people. In addition, several armies received American equipment but were not trained by the United States. The numbers of air force and navy personnel already trained or being trained are also not included. On October 6, 1945, Admiral Barbey announced that a naval training center had been established in Qingdao, and three classes had already graduated, with 1,000 people in each class. Since Japan's surrender until July 1946, more than 1,000 naval officers had been trained in the United States. This program is still ongoing. According to Zhou Zhirou of the Aviation Commission, from Japan's surrender to February 1946, the government sent 2,000+ air force officers to the United States. He said that all the expenses for this program were paid for from the Lend-Lease program.\n\nAccording to the committee's statement: Since Japan's surrender, the US government has established a naval training school in Qingdao, an automobile training school in Nanjing, a communications unit training school and an engineering training school in Kunming, several parachute troop schools in Kunming, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hengyang, a special engineer training school in Chongqing, an air force training school in Hangzhou, and an air force officer school in Chengdu.\n\nThe schools before Japan's surrender, including a staff training school, an infantry school, an artillery school, a Sino-American joint air force school, two Sino-American joint army training schools, and five Sino-American special training classes, will continue to operate.\n\nThis very incomplete account, and only up to 1946, explains the well-known driving force behind Chiang Kai-shek's major civil war. But what price did Chiang Kai-shek pay to American imperialism?\n\nFirst, expend China's territorial rights, allowing American troops to be stationed in China and giving the United States land bases.\n\nSecond, expend China's airspace rights, allowing American aircraft to freely patrol all of China and giving the United States air bases.\n\nThird, expend China's territorial sea rights, allowing the American navy to freely cruise China's territorial waters, freely station in China's seaports, and giving the United States naval bases.\n\nFourth, expend China's political power, allowing the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs, recognizing the United States' final decision-making power over China's internal affairs, allowing the United States to determine the Chiang family dynasty's internal policies, and placing the Chiang family dynasty's various political institutions under the supervision of American advisors or other titles.\n\nFifth, expend China's military power, replacing \"nationalization of the army\" with Americanization of the army, placing the Chiang family dynasty's army, air force, and navy under the control of American military advisory groups.\n\nSixth, expend China's financial power, allowing the United States to supervise the Chiang family dynasty's finances and turning China's financial system into an appendage of the American financial system.\n\nSeventh, expend China's diplomatic power, with foreign policy dictated by Washington, undermining the veto power to defend China's independent diplomacy in the United Nations, supporting the American imperialist policy of protecting Japanese aggressors, allowing Japanese fishing boats to fish in Chinese coastal waters, resuming trade with Japan before the peace treaty, implementing the Japanese aggressors' original plan of \"industrial Japan, agricultural China,\" and acting as an assistant to American war-mongers, provoking a third world war.\n\nEighth, expend China's police power, allowing American military police to patrol in China, with some places implementing \"Sino-American joint police and military duties,\" organizing \"Sino-American police and military liaison offices,\" and cooperating with the United States to train secret agents, jointly operating the so-called \"Sino-American Cooperation Institute\" and the so-called \"Sino-American Joint Secret Agent Training Class\" so that the United States can control the police, military police, and secret agents under the rule of the Chiang family dynasty.\n\nNinth, expend China's judicial power, reviving extraterritoriality (for example, agreeing with the United States that \"all American military personnel in China who commit criminal cases shall be tried exclusively by their own military courts and military authorities\") and disguised consular jurisdiction (for example, organizing the so-called \"Sino-American Business Arbitration Committee\").\n\nTenth, expend China's human rights, allowing the American military to freely slaughter, rape, and insult Chinese people for pleasure within Chinese territory.\n\n(⑴⑵)\n\nEleventh, recognize the universal freedom of American residents in China, allowing them to freely reside, travel, do business, and engage in all other undertakings throughout Chinese territory, not only enjoying the same treatment as Chinese people, but also enjoying privileges that Chinese people do not have, that is, turning China into America's China.\n\nTwelfth, recognize the United States' free reconnaissance rights and aerial photography rights in China, providing the United States with all national secrets.\n\nThirteenth, expend China's industrial and mining rights, allowing the United States to invest in all industrial and mining industries so that American financial capital can freely engage in exclusive control and \"development\" in China, especially in operating military base industries.\n\nFourteenth, expend China's agricultural rights, preparing for the so-called \"Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group\" to carry out the plan of \"Sino-American joint control of agricultural production.\"\n\nFifteenth, expend China's fishing rights, allowing the United States to operate and monopolize China's fishery production.\n\nSixteenth, expend China's commercial rights, allowing American goods to engage in exclusive dumping in China through \"legal trade\" and various forms of smuggling.\n\nSeventeenth, expend China's customs rights, abandoning protective tariffs, and agreeing to the demands of American imperialism to use customs as collateral for loans from the United States.\n\nEighteenth, expend China's inland river navigation rights, allowing the United States to destroy China's shipping industry.\n\nNineteenth, expend China's railway transportation rights, starting with the \"Sino-American joint venture\" of the Yuehan Railway and the Chuandian Railway.\n\nTwentieth, expend China's cultural and educational rights, allowing the United States to control China's education through free cultural and educational activities in China and in the form of educational foundations.\n\nTwenty-first, recognize the United States' sole \"suzerainty\" over China, the so-called \"treatment enjoyed by it, in any case, shall not be lower than the treatment given to any third country now or in the future,\" which is to openly turn China into an exclusive dependency and colony of American imperialism.\n\nAll patriotic compatriots! This is a shocking New Twenty-One Demands that will lead to national subjugation and racial extinction! This is the greatest auction in ancient and modern times! Looking at China's sovereignty, from land to sea, from sky to ground, from politics to economy, from material to culture, from the present to the future, is there anything that has not been auctioned off by Chiang Kai-shek? The vast majority of these Twenty-One Demands have been publicly expressed in separate or relatively concentrated written treaties. Some have not yet been expressed in public written treaties, but in fact, they have been implemented step by step in the KMT-controlled areas! The vast majority are facts first, followed by treaties. The treaties that the US and Chiang have successively announced are almost all treaty confirmations of existing facts. The reason why the US and Chiang have not fully concentrated and publicized these Twenty-One Demands in one treaty is because what they consider important is the realization of the facts, and it depends on the step-by-step advancement of the facts, and complete concentration in one treaty would easily arouse the Chinese people's surprise. But there are also treaties that are relatively concentrated in expression, such as the \"Sino-American Commercial Treaty,\" the so-called \"Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation,\" signed on November 4, 1946. This is truly a sharp knife piercing the heart of the Chinese people! The British weekly \"New Statesman and Nation,\" published on November 22 of the same year, explained the conclusion of the \"Sino-American Commercial Treaty\" in this way: \"It is a large and strong country destroying every line of defense of an economically backward country, and this is the price of supporting a traitorous and reactionary government to engage in civil war in order to control the economic lifeline of this country.\" In fact, this estimate is not complete. The Sino-American Commercial Treaty is a form, an aspect, of the fact that American imperialism has already controlled China militarily, politically, financially, and economically through Chiang Kai-shek's hands. The fact that American imperialism controls China militarily, politically, financially, and economically is the cause, and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty is the effect. However, the effect becomes the cause again, and the Sino-American Commercial Treaty will inevitably strengthen American imperialism's control over China. This is a slave contract that China has never had before. Let's compare the Twenty-One Demands presented by Japanese imperialism to Yuan Shikai in the fifth year of the Republic of China with this \"Sino-American Commercial Treaty.\" The privileges stipulated in Japan's Twenty-One Demands still have a considerable scope. And let's compare the secret agreement between Japan and Wang Jingwei with this \"Sino-American Commercial Treaty.\" The military, political, and economic privileges stipulated by Japanese imperialism in that secret agreement also pointed out certain zones. However, the privileges included in the Sino-American Commercial Treaty for the United States in China cover \"the entire territory of China,\" and what it reflects is not only economic privileges, but in fact, it reflects that American imperialism enjoys all privileges militarily, politically, financially, economically, and in culture and education. Because anyone can clearly see that if American imperialism had not obtained military, political, and financial control privileges in China, it would be impossible to obtain such economic privileges. Shortly after the \"Sino-American Commercial Treaty,\" on December 20, 1946, Chiang Kai-shek signed the \"Sino-American Aviation Agreement,\" which sold out all of China's airspace rights. One agreement followed another, and each agreement supplemented the new content of Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous sale of China's New Twenty-One Demands. Public agreements are not enough, so add secret agreements. Secret agreements are not enough, so supplement them with public agreements. Big agreements are not enough, supplement them with small agreements. Small agreements are not enough, so here comes a big agreement again. On October 17, 1947, the Chiang thief government agreed to the US military's note on stationing troops in China, signed the so-called \"Sino-American Relief Agreement\" on October 27, the \"US-China Education Fund Agreement\" signed on November 10, the \"Sino-American Naval Agreement\" officially announced on December 8, and the secret negotiations on loans secured by customs, etc., are all enrichments and more concretization of the above-mentioned New Twenty-One Demands. In short, we are the fish and meat on the chopping block, this is everything about all Chiang-US agreements, and in reality, the US military's killings and rapes in China have made the Chinese people even worse than fish and meat. In early 1946, the US military authorities in Tianjin stipulated the price of Chinese people, that is, for every Chinese person killed by the US military, a compensation of 100,000 KMT currency would be paid uniformly, while a dead donkey would be compensated 135,000 yuan. Therefore, a reporter from the United Press said: \"The US military discovered that in this productive country, human life is very cheap.\" In fact, countless Chinese people, simply because the US military wanted to have fun, were either killed, crushed to death, thrown into the water to die, raped to death, ... where is there any \"price\"? The vicious and evil Chiang Kai-shek is selling the Chinese people without any price!\n\nPeople all know that Yuan Shikai was a great traitor who sold the country. The articles in the fifth category of Japan's Twenty-One Demands mainly stipulated that Japan would control the entire political, financial, military, police, railway transportation, and cultural power of China. However, Yuan Shikai's agreement was still cautious, and Japanese imperialism was also afraid of causing trouble all at once, so in the end, this fifth category was only written as \"negotiations will be held later.\" No matter how treacherous Yuan Shikai was, and how clumsy his lies were, he also knew that signing the Twenty-One Demands would offend the world and future generations. In the so-called \"secret discussion,\" he also wrote that it was a \"foreign enemy,\" and also wrote \"what the heart considers dangerous, shed tears and say, do not forget the events of May 7.\" Moreover, when Yuan Shikai and the Northern Warlords were in power, the Twenty-One Demands were not truly implemented. But what about Chiang Kai-shek? Chiang Kai-shek's New Twenty-One Demands sold out everything. Mencius said: \"Everyone has a sense of shame and evil.\" But Chiang Kai-shek has no sense of shame or evil at all. He sold it very \"generously.\" Unlike Yuan Shikai, Chiang Kai-shek does not think that American imperialism's exclusive occupation of China is a \"foreign enemy.\" According to Chiang Kai-shek's \"Central Daily News\" editorial, Chiang Kai-shek believes that \"anti-Americanism is anti-motherland.\" In Chiang Kai-shek's dictionary, \"China\" has long ceased to be an independent geographical noun.\n\nPatriotic compatriots! This is the actual content of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of a major civil war! For whom is Chiang Kai-shek fighting against the Chinese people? In 1946, the British public opinion circle once said: \"Truman is the supreme commander directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to conduct the civil war.\" In July 1946, Bai Chongxi held a high-level military officer meeting in Xinxiang, saying: \"Marshal Ma once blamed us for not fighting well outside the customs, that the Kuomintang army is too useless, so this time everyone must fight for a breath, otherwise Marshal Ma will scold us for being useless again.\" This truly vividly shows the slave mentality of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group launching the civil war. On July 26, 1947, Chiang's Central News Agency New York telegram reported a letter from the \"American Policy Association for China,\" organized by American invaders, to Wedemeyer, which stated: \"The Chinese National Government is fighting for us today.\" Chiang's bandit news agency reported this naked declaration of American invaders with a despicable sense of gratitude, and this declaration, from Chiang Kai-shek's side, is to announce that Chiang Kai-shek is fighting for American imperialism. The American Howard newspaper system said: \"From the American point of view, there is one important thing that is very correct - Chiang Kai-shek is within the American front.\" Chiang Kai-shek can no longer be regarded as a \"Chinese,\" and if he is to be regarded as anything, he can only be regarded as the biggest traitor and national betrayal in China. This is said completely and clearly from what American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek himself have announced.\n\nHowever, while Chiang Kai-shek is able to betray China, the Chinese people have full power to restore China. Chiang Kai-shek is an incomparably greater traitor than Yuan Shikai, but the power of the Chinese people is incomparably greater than in Yuan Shikai's era. Yuan Shikai's dynasty was shattered by the power of the Chinese people in the era of the old democratic revolution, and Chiang Kai-shek's dynasty will surely be shattered by the greater power of the Chinese people in the era of the new democratic revolution. And it will definitely be shattered completely. And the American imperialist plan to destroy China will also be completely shattered by the Chinese people soon, and the Chinese people will definitely completely end imperialist aggression against China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋介石盗卖中国的新廿一条\n陈伯达\n1948-02-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋介石盗卖中国的新廿一条\n    陈伯达\n    毛泽东同志最近关于中国大革命的檄文“目前形势和我们的任务”说到：“以蒋介石为首的中国反动派，和日本帝国主义的走狗汪精卫一模一样，充当美国帝国主义的走狗，将中国出卖给美国，发动战争，反对中国人民，阻止中国人民解放事业的前进。”现将拙稿“人民公敌蒋介石”这一节先在报纸上发表出来，供作大家研究毛泽东同志这个大革命檄文的参考。作者记。\n    蒋介石进行内战的社会基础是封建与买办的制度，但所依靠的主要力量在外而不在内。如果没有美帝国主义对蒋介石的援助，中国人民早就可以轻快地扫除了蒋家朝廷这一堆垃圾。为着维持大封建奴隶主与大洋行买办这个摇摇欲坠的最后王朝，以便美国帝国主义独占中国，美帝国主义者援助蒋介石的内战，用了一切的方法。一九四五年八月二十二日在日本投降之后，杜鲁门宣称一切租借法案的契约不再继续，可是，为着支持蒋介石反人民的战争，杜鲁门就自食其言，于十一月十五日宣称对国民党的租借法案将再延长。上海密勒氏评论报一九四六年十二月二十一日的社论，介绍过美国“民主的远东政策委员会”暴露美帝在华活动的一个小册子，其中有些概括的材料：\n    该委员会对战后租借法案的总结是：\n    根据一九四五年九月二十七日纽约时报载，印缅战区美国剩余战争物资总量五亿美金，悉数售与中国，其中一亿五千万美金之军火，包括七百架飞机，已经移交清楚。\n    根据杜鲁门关于租借法案的报告，自日本投降起到一九四五年底止，国民政府共收到租借物资六亿零二百万美金，包括价值六千八百万美金的车辆和五千万美金的弹药。\n    此外，美国还几次允许将剩余的物资售与中国。一项是一九四六年七月三十日售与的一亿五千万美金。一九四六年八月三十一日出售太平洋岛屿剩余战争物资，计八亿二千五百万美金。\n    进出口银行已借给中国的贷款已知道的有两笔。一笔为五亿六千万美金。据一九四五年十一月二十九日“华尔街日报”所载，这笔贷款到一九四六年底将用去三分之二。另一笔为六亿七千万美金的美棉贷款，这是美国新闻处一九四六年九月十二日公告上发表的。\n    一九四六年七月中，送给国民政府军舰二百七十一艘。\n    以上所述是美国在军事上、财政上、援助国民党政府的不完全的一个估计。然而，有几项是值得注意的。全部美国所装备及训练的中国军队数字计二十二个军，五十七个师，共七十万零七千人。此外还有几个军得到美国装备但未经美国训练。还有已经训练或正在训练中的空军和海军数字亦不包括在内。一九四五年十月六日巴贝海军上将宣布，在青岛已成立一海军训练所，已有三班毕业，每班一千人。自日本投降起到一九四六年七月止，海军士官有一千人以上在美受训。此项计划现仍继续进行。根据航空委员会周至柔说，自日本投降到一九四六年二月止，政府已派空军士官二千×百人赴美。他说这计划的所有费用是由租借法案中偿付之。\n    据该会宣称：自从日本投降起美国政府设立了一个海军训练学校在青岛，一个汽车训练学校在南京，一个通信部队训练学校及一个工程训练学校在昆明，若干降落伞部队学校在昆明、南京、广州和衡阳，一个特种工程师训练学校在重庆，一个空军训练学校在杭州，一个空军军官学校在成都。\n    日本投降前的学校，包括一个参谋训练学校，一个步兵学校，一个炮兵学校，一个中美混合空军学校，两个中美联合陆军训练学校和五个中美特别训练班，还将继续办下去。\n    这一个很不完全的、而且只说到一九四六年的帐单，说明了人所共知的蒋介石举行大内战的动力。但蒋介石则付给了美帝国主义以什么代价呢？\n    第一，支出中国的领土权，让美国军队驻在中国，给美国以陆军基地。\n    第二，支出中国的领空权，让美国飞机自由巡逻全中国，给美国以空军基地。\n    第三，支出中国的领海权，让美国海军自由游弋中国的领海，自由驻防中国的海港，给美国以海军基地。\n    第四，支出中国的政权，让美国干涉中国内政，承认美国对中国内政的最后决定权，由美国决定蒋家朝廷对内的各种政策，把蒋家朝廷各种政治机构放在美国顾问或其他名义的监督之下。\n    第五，支出中国的军权，以军队美国化代替“军队国家化”，把蒋家朝廷的陆空海军放在美国军事顾问团的支配之下。\n    第六，支出中国的财权，由美国监督蒋家朝廷的财政，并把中国的金融系统变成美国金融系统的附属品。\n    第七，支出中国的外交权，对外政策一切听命于华盛顿，破坏在联合国中保卫中国独立外交的否决权，拥护美国帝国主义保护日本侵略者的政策，允许日本渔船在中国沿海捕鱼，在对日和约之前恢复对日贸易，执行日本侵略者原来“工业日本，农业中国”的计划，充当美国战争贩子的助手，挑拨第三次世界大战。\n    第八，支出中国的警察权，让美国宪兵驻在中国巡逻，有地方实行“中美警宪联合勤务”，组织“中美警宪联络室”；与美国合作训练特务，合办所谓“中美合作所”与所谓“中美联合特务训练班”，以便美国控制蒋家朝廷统治下的警察，宪兵与特务。\n    第九，支出中国的司法权，复活治外法权（例如与美国协定“一切美国军事人员在华如犯刑事案件的，交由其本国军事法庭军事当局单独裁判”）和变相的领事裁判权（例如组织所谓“中美商务公断委员会”）。\n    第十，支出中国的人权，让美军在中国领土内以自由屠杀、奸淫、侮辱中国人为取乐。\n    　　　　（⑴⑵）\n    第十一，承认美国在中国的居民的普遍自由权，许其在中国领土全境内，自由居住、旅行、经商以及经营其他一切事业，不仅与中国人同等待遇，并且享有中国人民所没有的特权，即把中国变成美国人的中国。\n    第十二，承认美国在中国的自由侦察权与空中摄影权，供给美国全部国家秘密。\n    第十三，支出中国的工矿权，允许美国投资一切工矿业，以便美国金融资本自由在中国进行独占和“开发”，特别是经营军事基地工业。\n    第十四，支出中国的农业权，准备由所谓“中美农业技术合作团”进行“中美一起管制农业生产”的计划。\n    第十五，支出中国的渔业权，由美国经营垄断中国渔业的生产。\n    第十六，支出中国的商业权，让美国商品经过“合法贸易”与走私的各种形式，在中国进行独占的倾销。\n    第十七，支出中国的海关权，放弃保护税，并同意美帝国主义的要求，将海关作为向美国借款的抵押。\n    第十八，支出中国的内河航行权，让美国摧毁中国的航业。\n    第十九，支出中国的铁路交通权，由“中美合办”粤汉路和川滇路开始。\n    第二十，支出中国的文化教育权，由美国经过对华文化教育的自由活动与以教育基金的形式控制中国的教育。\n    第二十一，承认美国对于中国的惟一“宗主权”，所谓“其所享受之待遇，无论如何，不得低于现在或将来所给予任何第三国之待遇”，即系公开把中国变为美国帝国主义独占的附属国与殖民地。\n    一切爱国的同胞们！这是惊心动魄的亡国灭种的新二十一条！这是古今中外最大的拍卖！看中国的主权，从陆上到海上，从天上到地下，从政治到经济，从物质到文化，从现在到将来，还没有被蒋介石拍卖在内的吗？这廿一条绝大部分已公开表现在分别的或比较集中的成文的条约，有的虽则还没有经过公开的成文的条约表现出来，但事实上，在蒋管区都条条步步实现了！绝大部分都是事实在先，条约在后，蒋美所陆续公布的条约，差不多都是对于业已存在的事实加以条约上的肯定而已。美蒋所以没有把这二十一条完全集中公开在一个条约上，因为他们所认为重要的，是事实的实现，并有待于事实的步步推进，而且完全集中在一个条约上，就容易引起中国人民的惊觉。但比较集中表现的条约也是有的，例如一九四六年十一月四日签订的“中美商约”，即所谓“中美友好通商航海条约”。这真是一把尖刀刺入中国人的心脏！同年十一月二十二日出版的英国“新国家与民族”周刊上这样解释过“中美商约”的缔结：“就是一个大而强的国家，摧毁一个经济上落后的国家的每道国防线，而且这就是支援卖国的和反动的政府从事内战，以达到掌握这个国家经济命脉的代价”。事实上，这还估计得不完全。中美商约乃是美国帝国主义经过蒋介石的手，业已在军事上、政治上、财政上、经济上控制了中国所表现的一种形式，一个方面的形式。美国帝国主义在军事上政治上财政上经济上控制中国的事实是因，中美商约是果，不过，果又变成因，中美商约必然又加强了美国帝国主义在中国的控制。这是中国从来没有的奴隶契约。试拿民国五年日本帝国主义向袁世凯提出的二十一条单和这一个“中美商约”相比吧，日本的二十一条所规定的特权，还有相当的范围。又再试拿日本与汪精卫的密约单和这一个“中美商约”相比较吧，日本帝国主义在那密约里面，所规定的军事的、政治的、经济的特权，也还指出一定的地带。但中美商约所包括的美国在中国的特权，却是包括了“中国领土全境内”，而其所反映的，并不只是经济的特权，实际上，是反映了美国帝国主义在军事上政治上财政上经济上文化教育上享有一切特权。因为任何人都能够清楚：美国帝国主义如果没有在中国取得军事上政治上与财政上控制的特权，要取得那种经济的特权，便是不可能的。在“中美商约”后不久，一九四六年十二月二十日，蒋介石又签订了出卖全部中国领空权的“中美航空协定”了。一个协定接着一个协定，而每一个协定都使蒋介石盗卖中国的新二十一条补充了新的内容。公开的协定不够，加之以秘密的协定；秘密的协定不够，又辅之以公开的协定。大协定不够，补充之以小协定；小协定不够，又来一个大协定。一九四七年十月十七日，蒋贼政府同意美军驻在中国的照会，十月二十七日签订所谓“中美救济协定”，十一月十日，签订的“美国对华教育基金协定”，十二月八日正式宣布的“中美海军协定”，以及关于以海关抵押借款的秘密谈判，……等等，都是对于上述新二十一条的充实和更具体化。总之，人为刀俎，我为鱼肉，这就是一切蒋美协定的一切，而在实际上，美军在中国的屠杀奸淫，已把中国人连比鱼肉都不如。一九四六年初天津的美军当局规定过中国人的价格，即美军杀死一个中国人，一律赔偿蒋币十万元，死驴子一条，则赔偿十三万五千元。因此联合社记者说：“美军发觉，在这多产的国家里，人命是非常便宜的”。其实，不知多少中国人，仅仅因为美军要取乐，或被杀死，或被碾死，或被抛掷水里而死，或被奸淫而死，………那里有什么“价格”？穷凶极恶的蒋介石是把中国人无价出卖的！\n    人们都知道袁世凯是卖国的大奸恶。日本二十一条的第五号里面的条文，主要是规定由日本掌握整个中国政治、财政、军警、铁道交通与文化的大权，但袁世凯的答应还有所顾忌，而日本帝国主义也因为怕一下子惹出乱子，结果对这第五号，只写成了“日后协商”。不管袁世凯如何奸险，作伪日拙，也还知道他签订二十一条，是得罪于天下及后世子孙，在所谓“密论”里面，还写出那是“敌国外患”，又写出“心所谓危，涕泣而道，其毋忘五月七日之事”。而且，当袁世凯在日及北洋军阀执政时代，二十一条是没有真正实现的。可是，蒋介石又何如？蒋介石的新二十一条卖尽了一切。孟子说：“羞恶之心人皆有之”。但蒋介石却是一点羞恶之心也没有，他卖得很“慷慨”。和袁世凯不同，蒋介石丝毫不认为美国帝国主义独占中国是什么“敌国外患”。按照蒋介石的“中央日报”社论，蒋介石认为“反美即是反祖国”。在蒋介石的字典中，“中国”早已不成为独立的地理名词了。\n    爱国的同胞们！这就是蒋介石发动大内战的实际内容！蒋介石是为谁而向中国人民作战？一九四六年英国舆论界曾称：“杜鲁门是指挥蒋介石集团进行内战的最高统帅”。一九四六年七月，白崇禧在新乡召开高级军官会议，说：“马帅曾责备我们关外没有打好仗，国民党军队太无用，所以这次大家必须争一口气，否则马帅又将骂我们无用了”。这真是活现了蒋介石卖国集团发动内战的奴才相。一九四七年七月二十六日蒋记中央社纽约电，报导美国侵略者所组织的“美国对华政策协会”致魏德迈一个函件，内称：“中国国民政府今日正为吾人而战”。蒋贼的通讯社以卑鄙感谢的心情报导美国侵略者这个赤裸裸的宣言，而这个宣言从蒋介石这方面来说，就是宣布蒋介石乃是为美国帝国主义而战。美国霍华德系报纸说：从美国之观点而言，有一重要甚为正确者--蒋介石乃在美国阵线之内”。蒋介石已不能算做“中国人”，要算，只能算是中国的最大汉奸卖国贼，这从美国帝国主义者与蒋介石自己所宣布的，是说得完全明明白白的了。\n    然而，蒋介石能够盗卖中国，中国人民却有充分的力量能够恢复中国。蒋介石比袁世凯是不可比拟的更大的卖国大盗，但中国人民的力量比袁世凯时代却更大得不可比拟。袁世凯王朝在旧民主主义革命时代，被中国人民的力量所打碎，蒋介石王朝在新民主主义革命时代，更一定将被中国人民更大的力量所打碎。并且一定将被打碎得彻头彻尾。而美国帝国主义灭亡中国的计划也一定将很快地被中国人民所完全打碎，并且中国人民一定即将由此完全终结帝国主义中国的侵略。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-27",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Our Newspaper's News] After the joint investigation team of the Border Government and this newspaper investigated the Wei Dianhua case in Xisu Village, Third District, Shahe (see yesterday's front page), it was found that the village's bad cadres organized a fake Poor Peasant League to conduct a fake \"election\" in order to evade mass sanctions and continue to manipulate the village's political power. Last lunar November, when district leaders proposed mobilizing poor peasants, village head Wei Jingsheng returned to the village and convened a meeting of four poor peasants, including Wei Jianxin, who dared not say anything, to discuss the establishment of the Xisu Village Poor Peasant League. The poor peasants attending the meeting did not understand, so Wei Jingsheng gave a speech on \"poor peasants holding power,\" and then asked everyone to find poor peasants. The poor peasants attending the meeting did not know how to find them or who to look for. The village head said, \"Find those who have worked as farmhands (long-term laborers), and cadres with good backgrounds can also be found.\" Everyone thought of one and asked the village head if it was okay? The village head said if it was okay, then find the next one. Nine were found in one night. In this way, public security officer Qu Xiuji and civil affairs committee member Zhang Wanqun also joined the Poor Peasant League, while village head Wei Jingsheng hid behind the scenes and began to play a puppet show.\n\n　　After the \"Poor Peasant League\" was established, the first thing they did was \"elect\" village cadres. Under Wei Jingsheng's manipulation, Wei Shuhe was elected as the village head. He was only eighteen years old and had just returned from planting mountain land in Shanxi last year. He knew very little about the village, his family had turned over relatively well, and he had no opinions on the old village cadres. The masses called him \"Little Village Head.\" The sixty-two-year-old poor peasant, Wei Laotong, was forgetful and could not easily find out the bad deeds of the past village cadres, so he was elected as the manager of the cooperative; Wei Tiansuo, a follower of the bad village cadres, was elected as the chairman of the farmers' association; and the old cadres all successively removed themselves.\n\n　　After the new cadres were elected, the old village cadres immediately handed over their work. The cooperative had never settled accounts or distributed dividends, and the masses knew there was a problem but dared not raise it. The bad cadres decided to settle the accounts first and perfunctorily pushed it through. Wei Yuxin, the newly \"elected\" cooperative accountant, said, \"The cooperative's accounts are a pot of mushy rice soup, pushing it on me, I didn't dare to take it, the accounts are still there!\" Wei Laotong was old and worried after being elected as the manager, saying, \"I'm forgetful, it worries me so much that I keep crying. I see through that the old cadres are making a fool of us.\" After the Little Village Head was elected, the superior cadres came to the village to work. The old village head, Wei Jingsheng, said, \"Find the new village head! Our village elected a new village head long ago.\" In reality, the person in charge of the village was still Wei Jingsheng. The \"Little Village Head,\" Wei Shuhe, was childish and didn't understand anything. He had to go to the old village head to ask and learn about any work, and ask for instructions on how to do things. The Little Village Head only dispatched meals and ran errands all day. Sometimes the old village head simply went to the district to attend meetings himself and then taught the Little Village Head upon his return. Wei Jianxin, the director of the \"Poor Peasant League,\" had been a farmhand all his life and was an honest person who didn't say anything. The \"Poor Peasant League\" couldn't do anything without the old village head. Wei Jianxin said, \"I have a bad memory at meetings. I can't say anything about the 'Poor Peasant League's' preparations for the meeting (meaning arrangement of work), so I always ask the old village head to arrange the meeting and announce it, he knows.\" Wei Chunliang, a poor peasant who was elected as the preferential treatment director, was estimated by the old cadres to be hard to control, so he has not been given any responsibility to this day. Wei Yuanlai, the militia instructor, was replaced because he dared to raise opinions and was sent by the old village head to study ironworking in another village.\n\n　　Last year, the fruits of the struggle included a flock of sheep, twelve hundred catties of cotton, and six bags of grain. The old cadres wanted to divide the sheep, but they were not divided because the poor peasants opposed it. The cotton was divided equally at forty catties per household. The grain was said to be for filling pits. Qu Xiuji, the public security officer who participated in the \"Poor Peasant League,\" received five dou, while Zhu Zhanmao's mother, a true poor peasant and family member of a martyr, did not receive a single grain despite not having enough to eat.\n\n　　The \"Poor Peasant League\" developed twenty-seven members. Some people suggested that Wei Dianhua, Wei Xianfu, and other true poor peasants who had been struggled against by the bad cadres in the past should participate. Qu Xiuji, the public security officer, said, \"I'd rather be shot than let them participate.\" On the contrary, he introduced middle peasant Wei Huibao to participate. In order to better control the \"Poor Peasant League\" from behind, village head Wei Jingsheng specially sent the shepherd Ma Xingjun to participate in the \"Poor Peasant League\" to inform him of everything. This person came from Tanhuacun and is either a deserter or an object of struggle whose situation has not yet been clarified. Wei Jingsheng kept him to settle down, gave him twenty-three mu of good land, and a courtyard. He bought him off to be his lackey. The \"Poor Peasant League\" has not talked about the Land Law Outline. The poor peasants do not know the Land Law and why they are participating in the \"Poor Peasant League.\" The \"Poor Peasant League,\" we don't understand what it does; we haven't heard of the Land Law, no one has read it to us. This is the answer given by Wei Yuxin, deputy director of the Xisu Village \"Poor Peasant League,\" to the investigation team comrades.\n\n　　Note: According to Comrade Zhang Zichao, head of the County Government Construction Section: Before and after the publication of the Land Law Outline in this county, the poor peasants were not well mobilized. Many villages organized \"Poor Peasant Leagues,\" which were praised by the county magistrate. In fact, most of them were controlled and manipulated by certain bad cadres, attempting to evade mass sanctions. It is hoped that the Shahe County Party Committee will continue to investigate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西苏庄坏村长怕群众起来反对他　组织假贫雇团打掩护\n\n1948-02-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西苏庄坏村长怕群众起来反对他\n  　组织假贫雇团打掩护\n    【本报消息】边府、本报联合调查小组，到沙河三区西苏庄调查魏殿花案（见昨日一版）后，发现该村坏村干组织假贫雇团，进行假“选举”，以便逃避群众制裁，继续操纵村政权。去年阴历十一月，区领导上提出发动贫雇，村长魏景升回到村后，就召集了魏见心等四个不敢吭气的贫雇开会，讨论成立西苏庄的贫雇团。参加会的贫雇不懂，魏景升讲了顿“贫雇掌权”，就让大家找贫雇。参加会的贫雇不懂怎样找和找谁，村长说：“找做过觅汉（长工）的，干部成份好的也可以找。”大家想到一个，就问村长行不行？村长说行就算找下一个。一晚上找到了九个，就这样公安员曲修己、民事委员张万群也进了贫雇团，村长魏景升自己则躲到背后牵线，开始演起傀儡戏来。\n    “贫雇团”成立以后，第一件事，是“选举”村干。在魏景升操纵之下，村长选了魏书和，他才十八岁，去年才从山西种山地回来，知道村里事很少，家里翻身较高，对旧村干没啥意见，群众称他为“小村长”。六十二岁的贫雇魏老同，忘性大，对过去村干部的坏事不容易找出来，被选为合作社的经理；坏村干的腿子魏天锁被选为农会主席；旧干部都陆续自己把自己撤换了。\n    新干部选出来，旧村干就马上交代工作。合作社从来没有结过帐分过红，群众知道有问题也不敢提出，坏干部就决定先交帐，马马虎虎的推过去。新被“选”为合作社会计的魏玉心说：“合作社帐是盆糊米汤，往咱身上推，我没敢接，帐还搁着哩！”魏老同上了年纪，被选成经理后发愁的说：“我忘性大，愁的我光掉泪，我看透旧干部是闹咱。”选出了小村长，上级干部到村工作。旧村长魏景升说：“找新村长吧！俺村早选上新村长了。”实际上村上的负责人还是魏景升。“小村长”魏书和，孩子气，不懂事，有啥工作也得去找旧村长问一问，学一学，请示个做法。小村长一天只是派派饭跑跑腿。有时上区上开会老村长干脆就自己去了，回来再教教小村长。“贫雇团”主任魏见心，做了一辈子长工，是个不吭气的老实人，“贫雇团”有啥事也离不了旧村长。魏见心说：“开会我记性赖，‘贫雇团’布置会场（布置工作的意思），我说不上话来，都是叫人家旧村长给布置会场宣布宣布，人家懂。”选上的贫雇魏春良当优抗主任，旧村干估计到怕掌握不了，直到现在没叫他负责任。民兵指导员魏远来换上后，因为敢提意见，被旧村长支到外村学铁机去了。\n    斗争果实中去年存下一群羊，一千二百斤棉花，六口袋谷子，旧村干要分羊，因贫雇反对没分成，棉花每家按四十斤均开了。谷子说是填坑，参加“贫雇团”的公安员曲修己一家就分了五斗，真正贫雇抗属朱占毛妈粮食不够吃，却一颗也没分到。\n    “贫雇团”发展了廿七个团员，有人提议让过去被坏干部斗争过的真正贫雇魏殿花、魏贤福等参加。公安员曲修己说：“枪嘣了我，他们也不能参加。”相反的，他却介绍了中农魏会保来参加。村长魏景升为了更能在背后掌握“贫雇团”，特别派了羊工马兴君参加“贫雇团”给他通风报信，这人是谈话村来的，是逃兵或是斗争对象尚未查清，魏景升把他留下落户，分给他二十三亩好地，一座院。收买他当狗腿。“贫雇团”没讲过土地法大纲，贫雇不知道土地法和为啥参加“贫雇团”，“贫雇团”是干啥的，咱弄不清；土地法没听说过，没人给念过。这就是西苏庄“贫雇团”副主任魏玉心给调查组同志的回答。\n    按：据县府建设科长张子超同志谈：该县在土地法大纲发表前后，贫雇没经过很好发动，许多村庄就组织了“贫雇团”，曾得到县长表扬，其实大都是被某些坏干部掌握操纵，企图逃避群众制裁的一种手段，希望沙河县委继续检查。"

    "content": "Lu Haoqin's Self-Criticism: Working Was For Becoming an Official\n\n(An'yang native, middle peasant, attended primary school. Started working in '45, currently serves as the Party Secretary of the Second District.)\n\nI joined the work force with the intention of becoming an official. When I initially handled affairs at the district level, I was cautious. However, in '46, after becoming a branch committee member, I felt I had power and began to seize things. For example, while working in × village, Liu Delin grabbed a silk belt. I reprimanded him, forbidding him from taking it, but eventually, I used it myself, thinking there was nothing wrong with using such a small thing. After becoming a political commissar, the idea of enjoying privileges intensified. To avoid walking, I used public funds to buy a new vehicle for my personal use. When the weather turned cold, I wanted to get a greatcoat. Hearing that the public mine policeman Zhang Yuanrui's coat was very good and cheap, I told Wu Hesong, \"I'm giving you three days to get that coat back, whether he likes it or not.\" Because I was the political commissar, he had no choice but to give me the coat. I, a Communist Party branch secretary, was learning the bad habits of the Kuomintang, arbitrarily scolding and beating people, plundering things, losing the qualities of a Communist Party member, and damaging the Party's prestige.\n\nIn leadership relations, I often tried to overwhelm others and establish my privileged rule. Therefore, I combined factionalism with opposition to leadership. For example, when Comrade Li Zhen was the branch secretary, I often had disputes with him, accusing him of patriarchal rule, when in reality, I wanted him to submit to my opinions. When promoting cadres, I tried to promote those I had cultivated, who would listen to me. Later, three out of the six branch secretaries were from my village, leading to my personal monopoly at the branch committee meetings. When Gao Baozhong was the branch secretary, I isolated him. At this time, out of seven branch secretaries, four were from my village, and two were cultivated by me, so everything was done according to my wishes. Later, when I became the political commissar, all the power was in my hands. I ate good food and didn't go to the countryside, used the messengers as I pleased, sat in the district office, only moving my mouth and not my legs. No one dared to disobey my orders about who to send to which village.\n\nAfter becoming the political commissar, I always wanted to establish my prestige in my village. Last year, during the summer tax season, I deliberately lowered my village's output so that the burden would be lighter than other villages. At the district burden meeting, people expressed dissatisfaction, saying, \"Things cannot be handled fairly; if a village has a district cadre, even good land becomes bad land.\" Hearing this, I accused the cadres of Dongshui of retaliation and criticized them, suppressing everyone's dissatisfaction. In reality, I was harming the interests of the entire district to establish my personal prestige and develop village factionalism.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 路好勤反省：工作是为了当官\n\n1948-02-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　路好勤反省：工作是为了当官\n    （安阳人，中农，上过小学。四五年参加工作，现任二区区委书记。）\n    我参加工作是为了当官，开始到区上办事还谨慎，四六年当了分委，觉得有了权，就开始抓东西。如在×村工作时，刘德林抓了条绸腰带，我训了他一顿不准他要，最后我用了，心想这点小东西用了没啥。当了政委后，特权享受思想发展更厉害，为省得走路，就用公款买了个新车子自己使用。天气冷了想搞个大衣，听说公矿公安员张元瑞的大衣很好，又便宜，我就告吴合松说：“给你三天任务，把大衣拿回来，不管他愿意不愿意。”因为我是政委，只有把大衣让给我，我是个共产党的分委书记，却学习了国民党的坏作风，随便打骂人掠夺东西，失掉共产党员的品质，损害党的威信。\n    在领导关系上常想压倒别人，树立我的特权统治。所以我就结合宗派反领导，如李珍同志当分委书记我就常和他闹纠纷，说他家长统治，其实是想让他服从我的意见。在提拔干部时，我尽量提拔我培养的人，好听我的话，后来六个分委中三个是我村的，形成分委会上我个人的包办。高保中当分委书记时，我是孤立他，这时七个分委，四个是我村的，两个是我培养的，也是我说怎样就怎样。以后当了政委，大权都掌在我手，吃好饭不下乡，通讯员由我使，坐在区公所，只动嘴不动腿，叫谁到哪村没有一个不听我的话。\n    我当了政委总想在俺村树立我的威信，去年夏屯时，我故意降低我村产量，出负担比别村都轻，全区负担会上反映不满说：“事情就不能办公平，那村有区干部那村好地也就变成坏地了”。听了这话便说东水干部报复，批评了他们一顿，把大家的不满压下了，实际是我损害全区利益，树立个人威信发展村宗派。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: Various places in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region resolutely protect industry and commerce, return wrongly confiscated industrial and commercial property, and correct the class status of merchants who were wrongly classified as landlords or rich peasants. In Mizhi Yin City, merchants who also owned land were mistakenly classified as landlords and rich peasants, and their industrial and commercial property was confiscated, causing fear among merchants in general, who hid their goods. After the Citizens' Committee studied the situation and convened a citizens' meeting to discuss and explain the issues, the mistakes were corrected one by one. For example, the Lü Chongchuan family, consisting of fifteen people, had an annual expenditure of about 24 shi of coarse grains. They owned 18 *xiang* of riverside land and 7 *xiang* of mountain land, all of which was rented out, yielding about 3 *shi* of coarse grain in rent annually. In addition, they ran a copper shop, doing everything themselves, with an annual income exceeding 21 *shi* of coarse grains, accounting for the main part of their livelihood. In the past, they were mistakenly classified as landlords, and their industrial and commercial property was confiscated. Now, their class status has been changed to handicraftsman with feudal exploitation. According to the principle that industry and commerce should be protected regardless of whether the owner is a landlord or not, all the confiscated goods from the shop have been returned. Only the majority of their land was taken out and distributed to the masses, while still leaving them two *xiang* of vegetable plots. Another example is Ai Shenhua, who mainly relied on a small sundry goods shop to make a living and owned 17 *xiang* of land, all of which was rented out. In the past, he was mistakenly classified as a rich peasant, but now his status has been changed to merchant. After the correction, Ai took the initiative to tell the work team that he had hidden goods in other areas and requested a letter of introduction to retrieve them and resume business. In Suide City's Fifth District, Guo Qingfeng's family of five owned five weaving machines (two of which were jointly operated). In addition to one family member participating in labor, there were also three hired workers and three apprentices. They also ran a shop and owned two and a half *xiang* of riverside land and two piles of paddy fields (10 *wei* is about 3 *mu*), all of which was rented out, yielding 2 *shi* of rent annually. In the past, he was mistakenly classified as a rich peasant兼middle merchant, and his industrial and commercial property was confiscated. After the Citizens' Group studied the situation, his class status was changed to handicraftsman, and all the confiscated property was returned. When Guo received his property back, he happily said, \"After the New Year, I will hire workers and apprentices and start work as soon as possible.\" In addition, the Suide Yihe City had registered and taken over the goods of several shops owned by landlords also engaged in commerce, such as Liu Shaoxiong and Li Jiaji, causing concern among merchants in the city. After the work team discovered this, they immediately corrected the situation and returned the received goods to their original owners one by one. At first, the farmers were unwilling to return the goods, but after patient persuasion, the farmers finally realized that protecting industry and commerce and prospering the market was completely in line with their long-term interests, so they voluntarily returned the goods. Now the merchants' morale is high, and the market has become even more prosperous.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: In the land reform in Zhenchuan City (under Zhenchuan County) in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, industry and commerce are effectively protected and supported. Shen Laoqi, Hao Liangcai, and Du Yujun in the city were all landlords and major fur merchants. During the land reform, only their land was confiscated and distributed to the masses, while their commercial part was left untouched. All merchants are currently operating as usual. Dozens of poor merchants were allocated houses from public housing and confiscated landlord property. For example, Yang Wenhuan's family of five came here from Henan twenty years ago to do business and never bought a shop or house. This time, they were allocated two shopfront houses. Small merchants Gao Shouren and Cao Youqing joined the peasant association, and Gao Shouren was elected as a fruit distribution committee member. Now the city's commerce is becoming increasingly prosperous.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁边区各地　坚决保护工商业　改正错订成份退还错误没收货物\n\n1948-02-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁边区各地\n  　坚决保护工商业\n  　改正错订成份退还错误没收货物\n    【新华社西北廿五日电】陕甘宁边区各地坚决保护工商业，退还错误没收的工商业，并改正错订为地主富农的商人成份。米脂银城市曾将兼有土地的商人误订为地主及富农并没收其工商业，引起一般商人恐惧，把货物藏起来，经市民委员会研究并召开市民会讨论解释后，一一纠正。如吕崇川全家十五口人，全年开支粗粮廿四石左右，有川地十八垧，山地七垧，皆出租，每年约收租子粗粮三石，另外开一个铜铺，完全自做自卖，全年收入超过粗粮二十一石，占其生活来源的主要部分，过去误订为地主并没收其工商业，现改订成份为手工业者兼有封建剥削，并按不论地主与否，工商业一律保护的原则，被没收的商店货物全部退还，仅将其大部分土地抽出，分给群众，并仍留给他两垧菜地。又如艾绅华主要靠小杂货铺维持生活，有地十七垧，全部出租，过去误订为富农，现改为商人，改正后艾即自动向工作团讲出他在外区隐藏货物，要求写介绍信去取回重整营业。绥德市五区郭庆丰全家五口人有织布机五架（二架系伙织）除自家一人参加劳动外，另有雇工三人，学徒三人，并开设店铺，另有川地二垧半水地二堆（一○为八堆约三亩），全部出租，每年收租二石。过去误订为富农兼中等商人，没收其工商业，经市民小组研究后，改订成份为手工业者，被没收的财物全部退还。当郭收回财物时高兴的说：“过罢年就雇工人学徒，赶快开工”。另绥德义合市曾将地主兼营商业的刘绍雄李家吉等几家商店的货物登记接收，引起该市商贩疑虑。工作组发觉后立即加以纠正，把接收的货物一一归还原主，开始农民还不愿意退，经过了耐心说服，最后农民们认识到保护工商业繁荣市场，与他们的长远利益是完全符合的，便自动退了出来，现商贩情绪高涨，集市已更加繁荣。\n    【新华社西北二十五日电】陕甘宁边区镇川市（镇川县属）土改中切实保护工商业并予扶助。该市申老七、郝良才和杜聿骏都是地主兼皮毛大商，土改中仅将他们的土地没收分给群众，其商业部分全部未动，各商现均照常营业。几十家穷困的商贩并从公房及没收地主财产中分得房屋。如杨文焕全家五口人，二十年前由河南来此经商，始终没有买下铺面和房子，这次分到了两间铺面房子。小商人高守仁、曹又清参加了农会，高守仁并被选为果实分配委员。现该市商业日趋繁荣。"

    "content": "My father started working as a long-term laborer for the landlord Jiang Yuanmei at the age of eighteen. When I was five years old, my mother died. My father discussed with Jiang Yuanmei about bringing me along. The landlord said, \"It's okay, but you have to help with some food costs!\" My father said, \"Then I'll earn a little less.\" That year, he earned seventeen silver dollars less and left me there. When I turned eight, I looked after the landlord's children. At thirteen, I herded cattle. In the eleventh month of that year, the twenty-seventh day, it snowed heavily. I told the landlord that the snow was very heavy, that I should feed the cattle and go herding another day when it cleared up. He said, \"What do I need you for? If you don't go, go home!\" I had no choice but to go herd the cattle. On the slope, it was so cold that I couldn't stand. My feet were swollen with cold, and I started crying. When I came back in the evening, my father saw it and asked me why my eyes were so red. I said that herding cattle on the mountain was unbearably cold. My father cried too. In the twelfth month, I followed the landlord to Xilutou Village to collect rent. I was told to carry four dou of wheat. I said I couldn't carry it. The steward said, \"Why can't you carry it?\" As he spoke, he put it on my shoulders. I walked ten steps before being crushed to the ground, my mouth bleeding. I cried loudly, and many people ran over from the village. Seeing this, they all said it weighed over a hundred jin, and this child couldn't possibly carry it. The landlord said: Can I let him eat for free? Even feeding a dog, it has to guard the door. I stumbled back with great difficulty, and my father cried again.\n\nWhen I was sixteen, I and my father carried a two-hundred-jin load together. The old and the young, we knocked the load onto my father, breaking his collarbone. The landlord didn't reason with us at all. I sent my father home. From then on, my father lay on the bed and fell ill. The landlord, Zhang Jiayu, because my father exposed him for twenty-four silver dollars, heard that my father was sick and returned home. Fearing that my father would die and he wouldn't be able to repay him, he immediately came to my house to ask for it. My father said, \"There are only four dou of wheat and two sheng of millet at home. I'm sick like this, and I still want to eat it.\" Jia Yu said, \"If you don't give it to me, can your son pay it back?\" My father said, \"When I die, there will be two and a half rooms and one mu of dry land, which should be enough.\" Zhang Jiayu then said, \"You have four dou of wheat, why don't you pay the debt?\" After speaking, he carried the wheat and left. My father died from his illness and anger.\n\nWhen I was eighteen, the famine was severe, and there was nothing to eat. I went to the landlord Yang Yaonan's house to beg for some grain. He said, \"I still eat white flour.\" I pleaded with him for a long time, and he finally said that there was some coarse bran left over from feeding the pigs, and I could take it. I quickly filled a sack, knelt down, thanked him, and went back. My wife ground and fried it again, and I went to the fields to find vegetables. This is how we barely survived for half a year. In July, I was sitting on the street. Old Zhang, a worker from the district, saw that my face was yellow and asked if I was sick. I said, \"I'm not sick, but I'm starving.\" Old Zhang said, \"Let me find you a job. Can you read?\" I said, \"I herded cattle when I was young, how could I know how to read?\" Old Zhang said, \"There is a friend at Qianji Goods Store, let me write you a letter of introduction, take it there.\" I immediately thanked him, saying, \"Old Zhang, you have saved my life.\" The next day, I set off, but Qianji Goods Store was sixty li away from my village. I begged for food along the way, and walked wearily for three and a half days. I finally arrived at the goods store and gave the letter to Manager An. In the evening, he finally talked to me, saying, \"Looking at you, can you even do any work? Go beg for your food, there is no job.\" I burst into tears. Fortunately, Deputy Manager Cao Huamin interceded, and I was allowed to stay. When I was twenty-two, I went to Yangyi Xinhua Goods Store. The landlord Yang Shenggui was the manager. One day, I was writing a few words on the table. Yang Shenggui said, \"Go do another job!\" In the evening, he said to others, \"Huaiyu was born herding cattle, and he wants to write. I said there's no need to worry about that. Born to be a rafter, you can't make it into a beam.\" He also said to me, \"Your father was a long-term laborer, and you still want to be an accountant? A toad wants to eat swan meat, but it can't reach.\" I said I didn't want to be an accountant, I just wanted to learn a few words.\n\nLast spring, the Yangyi branch closed down, and the business was no longer done. I went to the Changzhi Bookstore. When I first arrived, I did odd jobs for ten days. One evening, Comrade Du Yaoting said to me, \"You will take on clerical work.\" I said, \"My abilities are not strong.\" He said, \"Comrade Pei Ruwei will help you.\" I didn't know how to write foreign numerals when I first came. Comrade Pei Ruwei first wrote ten foreign numerals for me and told me to practice. He also told me to write copying exercises and keep a diary. He corrected them for me. Now I can keep accounts and write letters to friends and family.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 伢吃白面咱吃糠  地主的心赛虎狼\n江怀玉\n1948-02-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　伢吃白面咱吃糠  地主的心赛虎狼\n    江怀玉\n    俺父亲十八岁，就给地主江元梅住长工。我五岁上，俺娘就死了，俺爹与江元梅谈要带上我，地主说：“行是行，得帮些伙食！”俺爹说：“那我少赚几个钱就行。”当年少赚了洋十七元，把我留下。我到八岁上，就与地主看孩子，到十三岁上，就放牛。当年冬十一月二十七日，天下大雪，我就与主家说下雪很大，把牛喂上改天晴了再去放吧。他说：“用你干啥？要不去，你回家去吧！”我无奈放牛去了，坡上，冷的站不住人，把脚冻肿了，就哭起来，晚上回来，俺爹看见，便问我怎么眼红成那个样子？我说上山放牛冷的不行。俺爹也哭了一顿。到腊月，跟上地主去西鹿头村要租子，叫背四斗麦子，我说拿不动，掌柜说为啥拿不动，说着就给我搁在肩膀上，走了十来步远，把我压倒地下，嘴里碰出血，我大哭起来了，村里跑过许多人，看见都说百多斤重，这小孩可是拿不动。地主说：能叫他白吃吗？喂只狗，也得守门哩。东跌西跌好容易回来了，俺爹也哭了一顿。\n    到十六岁冬天和俺爹抬二百斤重驮子，老的老小的小，反把驮子跌到俺爹身上，把锁骨折断，地主毫不说理，我把俺爹送回家，从此俺爹躺在坑上一病不起。地主张贾玉，因我爹揭他现洋二十四元，听说俺爹有病回来，怕俺爹死了还不起他，马上来我家要，俺爹说：“家里只有四斗麦子二升小米，我病成这样子，我还想吃哩。”贾玉说：“你不给我，你儿子能还了？”俺爹说：“我死了，有两间半房子，一亩旱地也够了。”张贾玉又说：“你有四斗麦子，为啥不还帐？”说罢就把麦子背上走。俺爹病上加气就死了。\n    到十八岁时灾荒很重，没有啥吃，俺到地主杨耀南家央他借些粮食。他说：“有白面，我还吃哩。”俺好话给他说了半天，他才说有喂猪剩下的粗糠，你拿去吧，俺就赶紧装了一口袋，跪下谢了谢他就回来。俺娘们（妻）又碾又炒，俺上地寻菜，就这样糊了半年口。到七月，我在大街上坐着，区上工作员老张看见我脸黄黄的，便问我有病啦？我说：“病是没有，是饿的不行？”老张说：“给你找个工作吧，你识字不？”我说：“幼小放牛，那能识字。”老张说：“谦记货栈有个朋友，给你写上一封信，带上去吧。”我立即感谢的说：“老张你这可救了我命了。”第二天我就起身走，可是谦记货栈离俺村六十里路，我沿路讨饭吃，就软软的走了三天半，好容易到了货栈，把信交给安经理，黄昏，他才与俺谈说：“看你这个样子，也能干工作吗？还去要你的饭去吧，没有工作。”我放声大哭了，幸遇副经理曹化民同志说合，才算把我留下。我到二十二岁上就到阳邑新华货栈，地主杨生桂他是掌柜，有一天我爬在桌面上写了几个字，杨生桂说：“你去干另个工作吧！”到黄昏，他对别人谈：“怀玉是放牛出身，想写字，我说不用操那样心，生下做椽，不能做成梁。”他又对我说：“你爹是长工，你还想当会计，懒蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，可是达不到。”我说并不是想当会计，我想识几个字。\n    去年春间，阳邑柜上结束手续，生意不做了，我到了长治书店，初来时做了十来天杂工，一天黄昏，杜耀廷同志给我说：“你担任事务工作。”我说：“能力不强。”他说：“有裴如维同志帮助你”，我才来不会写洋码字，裴如维同志先给我写了十个洋码字，叫我练习，又叫我写盘仿，写日记，他给我改。现在会记帐，又能给朋友们和家里写信了。"

Many people became members of the poor peasant league in a confused manner. Of the four cadres in the Xijian Poor Peasant League, three are family members of puppet soldiers. These district cadres are trying to catch up with the \"trend\" and \"show off,\" rather than genuinely mobilizing the poor and hired peasants. Because they were not developed through proper poor and hired peasant review, the organizational composition is also very impure.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 18th Dispatch: Comrade Zhou Yang recently published an article in the Jin察冀 Daily entitled \"Oppose the 'Fancy Talk' Style, Establish a Revolutionary and Pragmatic News Style.\" The article pointed out that the serious 'fancy talk' style within the Jin察冀 Party actually represents the interests of landlords and rich peasants. The ideological root of this 'fancy talk' style mainly reflects the opportunism and catering tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie in politics and ideology. This means not reporting according to the actual situation among the masses, but only giving certain leaders what they want. One point is exaggerated into ten, and even if something doesn't exist, it can be claimed to exist. Conversely, ten points can be diminished to one, or even made to disappear entirely. Everything starts from self-expression. This is a person devoid of Party spirit, class stance, and therefore a people's stance; a person of very poor quality. This is one of the important reasons why the Party is infected with the 'fancy talk' style. Comrade Zhou Yang especially pointed out that many comrades still lack the habit of conducting practical investigations and are not good at meticulously observing and analyzing from an ideological perspective. Therefore, they often cannot accurately describe and demonstrate a matter. When things are described as good, everything is good; when described as bad, everything is bad. Many news reports are solely based on conversations or reports from cadres, and rarely are journalists going deep into the masses, personally seeing with their own eyes, and directly investigating the masses.\n\nComrade Zhou Yang proposed that in order to establish a pragmatic style for the Party newspaper, it is necessary to, firstly, truthfully reflect the actual life of the workers and peasants, and pay special attention to their daily life and work. Lenin and Chairman Mao always told us to pay attention to everyday things, because everyday things are the most concrete, and also the most massive and universal. Secondly, we must pay attention to discovering new things in life, analyze them, and examine which of them have developmental prospects, which of them meet historical requirements, and which of them are bad. A Party news worker must have a clear class stance, viewpoint, and a certain degree of political sensitivity and foresight. Our Party's newspapers should not only allow people to see the things before their eyes but also see further than what's immediately visible. It must enlighten people's minds and guide people forward. The above two points are the basic methods of news work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 写新闻要讲实际\n\n1948-02-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　写新闻要讲实际\n    【新华社晋察冀十八日电】周扬同志顷在晋察冀日报发表“反对客里空作风建立革命的实事求是的新闻作风”一文指出：晋察冀党内严重的客里空作风，实际上代表了地主富农的利益。这种客里空作风的思想根源，主要地是反映了小资产阶级在政治上和思想作风上的投机性和迎合性，就是不依照群众中的实际情况来报导，而专看某些领导者要什么就给什么，有一分讲成十分，没有的也可以讲成有，也可以把十分讲成一分，或者讲得没有，一切都从表现个人出发。这是一种毫无党性，毫无阶级立场，因而也没有人民立场的人，是一种品质很坏的人。这是党内沾染上客里空作风重要原因之一。周扬同志特别指出许多同志还很缺乏实际进行调查的习惯，还很不善于精密地从思想观察和分析，因而往往不能准确地叙述和论证一件事情。讲好就一切都好，讲坏就一切都坏。许多新闻报导是单纯从干部谈话或汇报听来的，很少是记者深入到群众中去，亲自用眼睛去看，直接向群众作调查得来的。\n    周扬同志提出为建立党报实事求是的作风，必须第一，真实地反映工农群众的实际生活，特别要注意他们日常生活和工作，列宁和毛主席总是叫我们注意日常的东西，因为日常的东西是最具体的，同时也是最大量性、普遍性的。第二，要留心去发现生活中的新的东西，并加以分析，检查其中那些是有发展前途的，那些是合乎历史要求的，那些是不好的，一个党的新闻工作者，必须具有明确的阶级立场、和观点及一定的政治敏感和远见，我们党的报纸不但要叫人们看到眼前的事情，并且要看得比眼前更远一点，它必须启发人们思想，引导人们前进。上面两点是新闻工作的基本方法。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch: The Hejiang Province recently announced its 1948 economic construction plan, deciding to organize a provincial production army to develop production and support the front lines. This plan focuses on developing agriculture. The province will reclaim 57,000 hectares of wasteland this year, increasing grain production by 43,000 tons. At the same time, intensive cultivation will be implemented on the existing 579,000 hectares of cultivated land, increasing grain production by 37,000 tons, in order to achieve the province's annual goal of increasing grain production by 80,000 tons. To increase paddy rice production and restore large-scale water conservancy, a loan of 180 million yuan will be issued to repair water conservancy projects in Tangyuan, Heli, and Yidong counties, increasing paddy fields by 5,000 hectares. The main grains will be soybeans and wheat, allowing the surplus to be exchanged for cloth and salt, improving people's lives. To complete the production tasks, 1,700 head of livestock have been purchased, and 1,000 head of livestock from urban areas have been mobilized to go to the countryside. In addition, it is planned to purchase 3,000 to 4,000 more head, and a batch of livestock will be accepted from landlords and rich peasants during the land distribution. To improve livestock labor efficiency, measures to protect and prohibit the slaughter of livestock are proposed, along with the planned selection and breeding of superior breeds, with a plan to breed 10,000 young animals throughout the year. Secondly, it was decided to complete the plan to send 5,000 to 6,000 urban poor farmers to the countryside before the end of January to increase the rural labor force. The province's state-run and county-run farms will concentrate manpower and material resources to increase production, streamline non-productive personnel, organize personnel from government agencies and military units to go to the fields for production, promote farmer production, improve cultivation methods, and develop animal husbandry.\n　　The industrial part of the plan proposes to develop 13,000 spinning households, completing the weaving of 30,000 bolts of cloth. In terms of mining: the Shuangya Coal Mine will produce 200,000 tons of coal this year. In terms of forestry: afforestation and forest protection will be carried out in a planned manner, especially in areas lacking forests and prone to waterlogging, where this work should be given more importance. Finally, it is proposed that each county should establish a cooperative within six months. This cooperative should be combined with the organization of mass production, such as organizing agricultural and sideline production, and developing women's spinning, transportation, and other production, and helping farmers solve various difficulties in production, such as agricultural tools, seeds, and livestock feed, as well as promoting the sale of rural by-products, supplying rural necessities, and reducing exploitation by merchants, so that cooperatives become the backbone of trading companies in rural areas. Where possible, medical and health services should be attached, and doctors and veterinarians should be organized to prevent and treat human and animal diseases.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 合江省本年建设计划　农业为中心发展大生产\n\n1948-02-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　合江省本年建设计划\n  　农业为中心发展大生产\n    【新华社东北电】合江省顷公布该省一九四八年经济建设计划，决定组织全省生产大军，发展生产，支援前线。该项计划以发展农业为中心，全省将于今年开荒五万七千垧，增产粮食四万三千吨，同时从原有耕地五十七万九千垧土地上施行精耕细作，增产粮食三万七千吨，以达全省全年增产粮食八万吨之目的。为增加水谷产量，恢复较大规模的水利，决定发放贷款一亿八千万元修复汤原、鹤立、依东等县水利工程，增加水田五千垧。粮食以大豆、小麦为主，使多余的换布、换盐，改善人民生活。为完成生产任务，已买进一千七百头牲口，和动员了城市一千匹牲口下乡，此外尚拟增购三千至四千匹，并将在平分土地时从地主、富农中接受一批牲口。为提高牲口劳动效率，提出保护和禁止宰杀牲畜办法，和有计划的选配优良畜种，计划全年繁殖幼畜一万头。其次，决定在一月底以前完成全省五千户至六千户城市贫农下乡计划，以增加农村劳动力。该省省营县营农场将集中人力物力，增加生产，精简勤杂人员，和组织机关部队人员下地生产，并推动农民生产，改良耕作方法，发展牧畜业。\n    该计划中之工业部分拟发展纺户一万三千户，完成织布三万匹。矿业方面：双鸭煤矿今年出煤二十万吨。林业方面：有计划的进行造林和护林，特别在缺乏林木及水涝地区，更要重视此项工作。最后提出每县要在半年内办好一个合作社，这个合作社要与组织群众生产结合，如组织农副业生产，及发展妇纺、运输及其他生产，并帮助农民解决在生产中的各种困难，如农具、种籽、牲口饲料等，以及推销农村副产品，供给农村必需品，减少商人从中剥削，使合作社成为贸易公司在农村中的支柱。在可能条件下附设医药卫生事业，组织医生、兽医，预防诊治人畜病疫。"

    "content": "Explanation of Terms\n    (Comrade Wensheng asks) I am unclear about several terms in the \"Truth Daily Editor Answers Readers\" message published on February 5th: Federation, Confederation, Customs Union, Danube countries, Balkan countries. Please explain these terms.\n    【Answer】◇ \"Federation\" is a form of state. It is composed of several countries into one country, with the same constitution and a common central government to carry out major national affairs. These countries are called member states. These member states have their autonomy and constitution within their jurisdiction (without violating the central constitution). For example, the Soviet Union is a federal state, composed of sixteen member states, but the difference is that the member states have the right to freely withdraw from the federation, and their diplomacy can also be independent according to the development of each member state. After World War II, the Ukrainian and Belarusian member republics already had diplomatic autonomy.\n    ◇ \"Confederation\" is a temporary or relatively long-term international alliance composed of several independent countries through agreement. These countries practice peaceful coexistence, and if any country outside these countries invades the territory of any one of them, these countries will jointly defend the security of that country's territory. Each country has the right to withdraw from the alliance if there are behaviors in the alliance that violate the interests of each country. For example, the \"Allied Powers\" and \"Axis Powers\" during World War II were a kind of \"Confederation\", and the \"United Nations\" organization after the war is also a \"Confederation\".\n    ◇ The Balkans are one of the three major peninsulas in Southern Europe (the other two peninsulas are the Italian Peninsula and the Iberian Peninsula). Surrounded by the sea on three sides, its political divisions include six countries: Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, and Turkey. These six countries are generally referred to as the Balkan countries. Among the six countries, except for Greece and Turkey, all are now new democratic countries.\n    ◇ The Danube is an important river in Europe, originating in the Alps, flowing through Germany, northeastern Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and bordering the Soviet Union. These countries are usually called the Danube countries.\n    ◇ \"Customs Union\" refers to the tax levied on goods exported from one's own country to foreign countries or goods imported from foreign countries into one's own country. \"Customs Union\" is an alliance of several countries regarding the tax levied on foreign goods entering their countries. That is, the tax rates charged on goods traded between allied countries are very low or even mutually non-existent, but the same tariffs are used against countries outside the alliance to counter the massive import of goods from these countries.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 名词解答\n\n1948-02-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　名词解答\n    （文生同志问）对于二月五日报上登的“真理报编者答读者”消息中有几个名词弄不清楚：联邦、邦联、关税同盟、多脑河国家、巴尔干国家。这几个名词请解答一下。\n    【答】◇“联邦”是一种国家形式。由几个国家组合成一个国家，有同一宪法，共同的中央政府以执行国家的大事。这几个国家被称为盟员国。这些盟员国在其权限内有其自主权及其宪法（不违反中央宪法）。如苏联就是联邦国，由十六个盟员国组成，但苏联不同的是盟员国有自由退出联邦的权利，根据各盟员国发展情形，其外交也可以独立。在第二次世界大战后，乌克兰盟员共和国及白俄罗斯盟员共和国已有外交自主权。\n    ◇“邦联”是几个独立国家协定暂时的或比较长期的一种国际联盟组合。这几个国家间实行和平共处的邦交，对外如有这几国之外的另一国家侵略他们间任何一国领土时，这几个国家同来保卫该国领土的安全。各国在联盟有违反各国利益行为时，有退出该联盟的权利。如第二次世界大战时的“同盟国”与“轴心国”就是一种“邦联”，又如战后的“联合国”组织也是“邦联”。\n    ◇巴尔干是南欧三大半岛之一（另二半岛是意大利半岛和伊伯利安半岛）。三面临海，其政治区划分南斯拉夫、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、希腊及土耳其六个国家。一般就称这六个国家为巴尔干国家。六国中除希、土二国外，都已是新民主主义国家。\n    ◇多脑河是欧洲重要河流，发源于阿尔卑斯山，流经德国、奥地利亚东北部、捷克斯拉夫、匈牙利、南斯拉夫、保加利亚，罗马尼亚，并经苏联边境，这些国家通常称多脑河国家。\n    ◇“关税同盟”，关税是指本国货物输出到外国或外国货物输进本国境内时所要缴的税。“关税同盟”是几个国家对外国货物进入本国内时所缴的税的一种盟约。即在联盟国之间的货物往来，相互所收的税率很低甚至相互不收税，但对联盟以外国家则以同一的关税以对抗这些国家货物的大量入口。"

All organ units must have the top leader take responsibility and personally take action, with planned and organized leadership. First of all, a meeting of all organ personnel and the main responsible cadres of organ production should be convened to convey and discuss the Central Bureau's decision and this notice, so that everyone can deeply understand that this cleanup is not only to overcome financial difficulties, but also to overcome all the speculative and opportunistic behaviors, financial disruptions, policy violations, and competition with the people for profit that have occurred in organ production in the past, as well as all behaviors that infringe upon the interests of the people. It is also to more powerfully support the front lines. All staff must be made to deeply understand this important significance, consciously care about revolutionary property, and actively take responsibility for everyone to clean up and everyone to supervise, in order to implement the Central Bureau's decision. (2) In the process of cleaning up, we must adopt a serious spirit of being responsible to the Party and the people, earnestly investigate and formulate specific and detailed plans, seek to ensure that revolutionary property is not lost, and prevent and oppose any phenomena that undermine the cleanup work, such as departmentalism, burying falsehoods and truths, private misappropriation, embezzlement and waste, decentralization and transfer, and favoritism and corruption. Once discovered, disciplinary action must be taken according to the seriousness of the circumstances. (3) Since organ production accounts for a large proportion of the major markets and industrial and commercial organs in our entire district, when the reorganization is completed, the financial and economic departments at all levels must take careful measures for the local markets, industries, and commerce, and specifically arrange and stipulate some appropriate and specific measures for prevention and remedy, so as not to cause drastic rises and falls in prices, imbalances in supply and demand, and damage to the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce in the liberated areas. The District Party Committee Cleanup Committee was established on February 21. The prefectural party committee-level cleanup committees should be formally established before March 5 to lead the cleanup work of the prefectural party committee level and the counties, and the list of committee members should be reported to the District Party Committee Cleanup Committee. In addition to being responsible to the prefectural party committee cleanup committee, the sub-district cleanup committees are also responsible to the military district cleanup committee. When statistics on property are compiled, the troops and the local area should be separated. In addition to being responsible to the county party committee, the county cleanup committees are also responsible to the prefectural party committee cleanup committee. The organ production of district-level organs and organizations shall be cleaned up in a unified manner by the county cleanup committee. The production operated by villages can be cleaned up in combination with filling in and averaging during the equalization.\n    [Taiyue News] The Taiyue District Party Committee Organ Production Cleanup Committee was formally established on February 21, with Comrade Wang Hefeng as the director, and Comrades Niu Peicong and Fang Shengpu as the deputy directors, and Comrades Gao Dexi, Jin Shimou, Cao Pu, Wang Jiong, Ji Jinzhang, and Ma Jian as members.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳区党委发出通知　认真清理机关生产\n\n1948-02-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳区党委发出通知\n  　认真清理机关生产\n    【太岳消息】太岳区党委为贯彻中央局关于清理机关生产的决定，特发出通知如下：（一）清理机关生产及机关财政是一件很重大很复杂的工作，各机关单位必须首长负责亲自动手，有计划有组织加以领导。首先应召集全体机关人员及机关生产主要负责干部的会议，传达讨论中央局决定及本通知，使大家深刻了解这次清理不仅是为了克服财政困难，而且也是为了克服过去机关生产中的投机取巧捣乱金融破坏政策与民争利的一切侵犯人民利益的行为，也是为了更有力的支援前线。必须让所有的工作人员都能深刻了解此重要意义，自觉起来关心革命财产，积极负责大家清理大家监督，才能贯彻中央局决定。（二）在清理过程中必须以对党对人民负责的严肃精神，切实清查规定具体周密计划，求得革命财产不受损失，防止与反对任何本位主义、埋伏虚实、私自挪用、贪污浪费、分散转移、徇情舞弊等破坏清理工作的现象，业经发觉，必须根据情节轻重予以纪律处分。（三）由于我全区各主要市场工商业机关生产占很大比重，在整理结束时，各级财经部门对当地市场工商业，必须作妥慎措施，具体布置规定一些适当地具体情况的预防与补救的办法，勿使物价暴涨暴跌，供求悬殊，损害解放区农工商业的发展。区党委清理委员会已于二月二十一日成立，地委级清理委员会应于三月五日前正式成立，领导地委级及各县清理工作，并将委员名单报区党委清委会。各分区清理委员会除对地委清委会负责外，并对军区清委会负责，统计财产时，应将部队与地方分开。各县清理委员会除对县委负责外，并对地委清委会负责，区级机关团体之机关生产，由县清委会统一负责清理，村经营之生产，可以在平分中结合填补及平分，进行清理。\n    【太岳消息】太岳区党委机关生产清理委员会，已于二月二十一日正式成立，王鹤峰同志为主任委员，牛佩琮、方声浦二同志为副主任委员，高德西、金世某、曹普、王炯、纪锦章、马健等六同志为委员。"

    "content": "Taihang News: According to reports from correspondents in Ping順 (Píngshùn), Licheng, Huguan, Lucheng, Huixian, Gaoyi and other counties, bad cadres and landlords and rich peasants in some villages have speculatively organized fake poor peasant leagues, attempting to gain the upper hand, suppress poor and hired peasants, deceive superiors, and undermine the democratic movement. According to reports and research, there are probably two types of fake poor peasant leagues: One is where bad cadres want to use fake poor peasant leagues as air-raid shelters to cover up their mistakes; this type is more common. Lu Tianshun, the village chief of Songjiazhuang in the fourth district of Lucheng, Wang Xiaonian, the chairman of the farmers' association, and Jin Fuqiu, the public security officer, falsely accused sixteen middle peasant households and six poor peasant households of being \"special agents\" last spring because they were settling personal grudges. They also struggled against nine middle peasant households and two poor peasant households, causing the masses in the whole village to be afraid to say anything, and any speech was dismissed as \"special agents\" spreading rumors. Now, in order to cover up their mistakes such as乱斗 (luàn dòu) [randomly struggling against people] and occupying excessive gains, and fearing that the masses will settle accounts with them when dividing the spoils, they first took the initiative to rope in wealthy middle peasants (whom they were afraid to struggle against) and other people to organize fake poor peasant leagues, threatening the poor and hired peasants who did not participate in the fake poor peasant leagues. On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth lunar month, a poor hired peasant, Pan Lan Nu, was beaten to death in a meeting for not having a road pass when going to her daughter's home; the suppressed poor and hired peasants dared not move. It was not until the fourth day of the first lunar month that the district authorities discovered this and detained the three bad cadres. Zhang Yan, a newly promoted district cadre in the fifth district of Huixian, after attending a meeting in the district to discuss the Outline Land Law, twice returned home and used private means to rope in people to organize a fake poor peasant league, arranging for Zhai Rong to be the head of the league, and distorting the provisions of the Land Law regarding the poor peasant league at a mass meeting; he said: \"The head of the league has the greatest power. If he says an egg is black, no one dares to say it is white. Anyone who says it is white is breaking the law; everything in the village, regardless of men, women, old, or young, must be approved by the head of the league.\" The village carried on like this for half a month before the district authorities discovered it and disbanded the league. Some villages in Beiliutan in Ping順 (Píngshùn) and the fifth district of Huguan also discovered fake poor peasant leagues of the same type as above. The other type is where class dissidents take advantage of the poor and hired peasants' dissatisfaction with the cadres, and speculatively rope in people to organize fake poor peasant leagues, mainly attempting to seize leadership and ruin the cadres. Liang Lao Lü, a bad egg in Beidu of Gaoyi, organized a fake poor peasant league by taking the opportunity to rope in people who were dissatisfied with the cadres after his three landlord relatives were liquidated by the masses last year, and he hated the cadres. After the promulgation of the Land Law, he took the opportunity to rope in people who were dissatisfied with the cadres to organize a fake poor and hired peasant league, and reported the village cadres to the district authorities, attempting to overthrow the cadres and seize power in the village; he also threatened the masses who joined the fake poor peasant league to keep it secret. Later, after in-depth propaganda of the Land Law, the masses automatically exposed this conspiracy, disbanded the fake poor and hired peasant league, and sent Liang Lao Lü to the district authorities for handling. In Chongyan, first district of Ping順 (Píngshùn), it was also discovered that the bad cadre and cooperative director (former village chief) Yuan Dongfa privately roped in poor and hired peasants to organize a small group (of six or seven people), brewing to replace all the cadres; Yuan Dongfa came up with bad ideas, and the other six or seven people came forward to do it. The above two different types of fake poor and hired peasant leagues have the same nature and results in undermining the Land Law and suppressing poor and hired peasants from standing up. We must mobilize the masses to expose them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行不少村庄发现假贫农团　领导上应切实注意检查  两种类型　一种是坏干部操纵一种是坏分子把持\n\n1948-02-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行不少村庄发现假贫农团\n  　领导上应切实注意检查           \n    两种类型\n  　一种是坏干部操纵一种是坏分子把持\n    【太行消息】据平顺、黎城、壶关、潞城、辉县、高邑等县通讯员报导，有些村庄的坏干部和地富分子，投机组织假贫农团，企图以先发制人来压住贫雇，欺哄上级，破坏民主、抽补运动。据报导研究，假贫农团大概有两种类型：一种是坏干部为掩盖自己错误，想以假贫农团当防空洞；这一类型比较多。潞城四区宋家庄村长路天顺、农会主席王小年、公安员靳富秋，因为去年春天曾以公报私仇，给十六户中农、六户贫农按上“特务”帽子，并斗了九户中农、两户贫农，致使全村群众不敢吭一声，一说话就说是“特务”造谣。现在他们为掩护乱斗和多占果实等错误，害怕群众平分时和他们算帐，即先下手拉拢富裕中农（他们怕斗）等组织假贫农团，威胁没参加假贫农团的贫雇。阴历腊月二十七日，贫雇潘兰女，因去他闺女家没开路条，即被开会打死，镇压的贫雇不敢动。直到正月初四区上发觉才把这三个坏干部扣起。辉县五区新提拔的区干部张彦，在区上开会讨论土地法大纲后，曾两次回家用私人拉拢办法组织假贫农团；布置让翟荣当团长，并在群众大会上曲解土地法中关于贫农团的规定；他说：“团长权力最大，他说鸡蛋是黑的，谁也不敢说是白的，谁说白的就是犯法；全村无论男女老少什么事情都得通过团长批准。”该村这样搞了半月，后来才被区上发觉解散。平顺北流滩和壶关五区有些村庄也发现和上述同类型的假贫农团。另一种是阶级异己分子利用贫雇对干部不满，投机拉拢组织假贫农团，主要企图是劫取领导权，搞垮干部。高邑北渎坏蛋梁老吕，因他本家三户地主去年都被群众清算，仇恨干部。土地法公布后，他便乘机拉拢对干部不满的人组织假贫雇团，向区上告村干，企图打垮干部，掌握村中大权；又威胁入假贫农团的群众要保守秘密。后来经过深入宣传土地法，群众自动揭露这一阴谋，解散假贫雇团，把梁老吕送到区上处理。平顺一区崇岩，亦发现坏干部合作社长（前任村长）原东发，私自拉拢贫雇，组织小集团（有六七个人），酝酿一律撤换干部；原东发出坏主意，其它六七个人出头干。上述两种不同类型的假贫雇团，其破坏土地法和压制贫雇不让翻身的本质和结果是一样的，都须发动群众揭发它。"

Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Czech Communist Party and Premier of the Cabinet, addressed the cheering masses, denouncing the Czech National Socialist Party (with two cabinet members), the Christian People's Party (with three cabinet members), and the Slovak Democratic Party (with three cabinet members). He stated that with the support of foreign reactionaries, they were attempting to prevent the passage of the democratic constitution and to sever the friendship between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, aiming to turn the country into a center for anti-Czech and anti-Soviet foreign espionage activities. According to recent reports, Interior Minister Nossek and Defense Minister Svoboda, after discovering foreign spies and treasonous activities within the country, ordered the military and police to take certain emergency measures. The aforementioned reactionary parties immediately opposed this, demanding in the State Council with a majority (out of 20 cabinet members, the Czech Communist Party held seven seats) that Nossek and Svoboda cease the aforementioned actions. The latter considered this suggestion a violation of the constitution and firmly rejected it. The cabinet members of the three parties then used this as an excuse to submit their resignations to President Beneš on the 20th, attempting to force Beneš to dissolve the parliament and then, taking advantage of the chaotic political situation, launch an anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and anti-people armed rebellion. In his speech, Gottwald demanded that Beneš accept the resignations of the three parties' cabinet members, resolutely stating, \"We will never let them return to the cabinet, and we will never put the police in the hands of the reactionaries.\" He also called for the establishment of a new people's democratic National Front, demanding that \"democratic and progressive figures who have already been proven from worker-peasant mass organizations and various national groups succeed the vacated posts of the resigned ministers.\" Gottwald concluded by calling on \"all Czech and Slovak people to raise their vigilance and preparedness, and to nip in the bud all provocative attempts by the reactionaries.\" He then shouted, \"Long live the democratic people's Czechoslovak Republic!\" \"Long live the Czechoslovak-Soviet alliance!\" Gottwald's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic cheers. The 200,000 people unanimously passed a resolution stating, \"We earnestly request Beneš to accept the resignations of the three parties' cabinet members! We want a new Gottwald cabinet without reactionary elements!\" After the meeting, the masses held a grand demonstration. As the demonstrators passed the central organ newspaper \"Free Speech\" of the National Socialist Party, which launched this anti-security agency movement, they shouted, \"Close down Free Speech!\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 26th: Prague Dispatch: National Front Action Committees have been formally established throughout Czechoslovakia in response to the joint call of Premier Gottwald and the Central Council of Trade Unions. Action Committees across the country have passed resolutions demanding that President Beneš accept the resignations of the ministers of the three reactionary parties and that individuals who can gain the trust of the people nationwide and quell all reactionary conspiracies participate in the Gottwald government. At the same time, the Liaison Committee of the all-Slovak resistance movement military organizations issued a declaration making the same request to President Beneš, stating, \"The leaders of the Slovak Democratic Party should not only resign from the positions of ministers in the central government, but must also resign from their positions in various Slovak administrative organs, especially the Administrative Committee and the Administrative Group.\" After days of intense debate, the Executive Committee of the Czech Social Democratic Party agreed on the 23rd by majority vote to the demands in the Czech Communist Party Central Committee's letter of the 21st. The demand was to immediately establish a government based on the cooperation of the Czech Communist Party, the Slovak Communist Party, and the Social Democratic Party, with the broad participation of new figures loyal to people's democracy. In other news, the Czech Paper Industry Workers' Union has unanimously resolved not to supply the reactionary National Socialist Party's \"Free Speech\" newspaper with newsprint.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 捷京廿万群众大会  反对三反动政党破坏共和国　捷总理呼吁成立新民族阵线\n\n1948-02-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　捷京廿万群众大会\n    反对三反动政党破坏共和国\n  　捷总理呼吁成立新民族阵线\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】布拉格讯：布拉格二十万群众二十一日在市政厅广场举行大会，反对三反动政党破坏共和国的阴谋。捷共主席内阁总理哥特瓦尔德向欢呼的群众发表演说，痛斥捷克民族社会党（有阁员二名），基督教人民党（有阁员三名），斯洛伐克民主党（有阁员三名），在外国反动分子支持下，力图阻止民主宪法的表决，并力图截断捷克与苏联间的友谊，要把我国变成一个反捷反苏的外国特务活动中心。按最近内政部长诺西克与国防部长斯沃波达，因发现国内有外国特务与叛国活动，曾下令军警采取若干紧急措施，上述反动党派即起而反对，在国务会议中以多数（内阁阁员共二十名捷共占七名）要求诺西克与斯沃波达停止上述行动，后者当认此一建议为违背宪法而予以严正拒绝，三党阁员即以此为借口，于二十日向总统贝奈斯提出辞呈，企图逼迫贝氏解散国会，然后趁纷乱的政治局势，发动反共反苏反人民的武装叛乱。哥特瓦尔德在演说中要求贝奈斯接受三党阁员的辞呈，坚决表示“决不让他们再回到内阁中来，决不把警察放到反动派手中。并呼吁成立新的人民民主的民族阵线，要求“以工农群众组织与各民族团体中业已证明为民主进步的人物，继任已辞职各部长的遗缺。”哥氏最后号召“全体捷克与斯洛伐克人民，提高警觉与戒备，在反动派一切挑衅企图刚见萌芽之时，就与以一举扑灭。”并高呼：“民主的人民的捷克斯拉夫共和国万岁！”“捷苏联盟万岁！”哥氏的演说一再为热烈的欢呼所中断，二十万群众一致通过决议称：“我们以全力恳请贝奈斯接受三党阁员辞呈！我们要一个没有反动分子的哥特瓦尔德新内阁！”会后群众并举行盛大示威游行。示威者经过发动这次反治安机关运动的民族社会党中央机关报“自由言论”报时，高呼“封闭自由言论报”。\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】布拉格讯：民族阵线行动委员会已在捷克全国各地正式成立，以响应总理哥特瓦尔德与职工会中央委员会的联合号召。各地行动委员会都通过决议，要求贝奈斯总统接受三反动政党各部长的辞呈，并以能获全国人民信任与能敉平一切反动阴谋的人物参加哥特瓦尔德政府。同时全斯洛伐克抵抗运动军事组织的联络委员会，发表宣言，向贝奈斯总统提出同样要求，并称：“斯洛伐克民主党领袖不但应该辞去中央政府部长职位，还必须同样辞去斯洛伐克各行政机关特别是行政委员会和行政团中的职位。”捷克社会民主党执行委员会于连日激烈争辩后，已在二十三日以多数表决同意捷共中央二十一日公函中的要求。按该要求为立即成立以捷共、斯洛伐克共产党与社会民主党合作为基础，并有忠于人民民主的新人物广泛参加的政府。另讯，捷克纸业工人工会已一致决议不供给反动的民族社会党“自由言论”报以白报纸。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: TASS, Prague, 21st: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party issued a declaration addressed to the working people of the country and the countryside, stating: \"The government is unable to perform its functions normally and solve the most urgent tasks in the coming month. This should be entirely the responsibility of the government members of the National Socialist Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party.\" The declaration pointed out: The irresponsible behavior of government members of certain parties is becoming increasingly obvious. They attack the state security organs in order to cover up and protect the espionage activities that are currently active, which have reached a rare degree and prove a major conspiracy by domestic and foreign reactionary forces against our republic. These spies, praised as \"dear people\" by the National Socialist Party, were sent into our country from the West and are already engaged in the work of rebuilding the German secret general staff's espionage system. This political crisis, suddenly provoked by members of the central government, poses a threat to the republic by agents of foreign reactionary forces. The declaration continued: \"The National Socialist Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Slovak Party have very clearly formed an anti-democratic and anti-socialist group, whose aim is to overthrow the people's democratic regime and hand over power to reactionaries. This reactionary behavior of the three parties is completed by the resignation of the ministers of those parties in the government. Therefore, the three parties have voluntarily become opponents of the government program.\" The declaration stressed: \"The Communist Party's leading organs believe that it is necessary to immediately unite the forces of all working people to support the Gottwald government, which is now calmly sticking to its post and implementing all necessary measures to defend the people's democratic cause and domestic security, peace, and order.\" The declaration concluded by calling on \"all working people in urban and rural areas, all workers, peasants, merchants, and freelancers, as well as all Czechs and Slovaks, to rise up to organize a consolidated national united front, resolutely support the Gottwald government, realize all the tasks inspired by the interests of the republic and the interests of our revolution, and strive for friendly alliance with the Soviet Union and other Slavic countries.\"\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Prague dispatch: The inside story of the treasonous conspiracy case, which triggered the current political crisis in Czechoslovakia, has gradually come to light due to the joint communiqué issued by the Czechoslovak Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior on the 22nd. The communiqué stated: \"The treasonous conspiracy was organized by Reichel, a murderer who has been wanted by the government for a long time. When the wartime Czech army was established in the Soviet Union, Reichel colluded with foreign intelligence agencies in the Soviet Union and cooperated with the Polish reactionaries who supported Anders. Soon after, he deserted and returned to the country to carry out anti-Soviet activities. In 1946, he was reported for crimes and fled to the American-occupied zone in Germany. According to the investigation, Reichel was indeed in contact with a number of traitorous military officers, conspiring together to overthrow the democratic government, and maintaining contact with foreign military intelligence agencies, providing the latter with intelligence and accepting the latter's orders. Reichel had officially begun planning an armed rebellion.\" The communiqué concluded: \"The entire treasonous organization has been uncovered, and the masterminds of the crime, whose activities have lasted for nearly two years, have all been arrested.\" It is reported that the detailed content of the treasonous conspiracy case cannot be announced because it involves various foreign countries. It is also learned that former Deputy Prime Minister Ersin, a member of the Slovak Democratic Party, has been arrested. He resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister last autumn on suspicion of treason.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 捷共揭穿三反动政党叛卖行为　号召人民保卫民主事业  叛国阴谋是由外国反动派指使\n\n1948-02-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n    捷共揭穿三反动政党叛卖行为\n  　号召人民保卫民主事业\n    叛国阴谋是由外国反动派指使\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社布拉格二十一日讯：捷克共产党中央委员会主席团，倾向国内城乡劳动人民发表宣言，内称：“政府已无法在今后一个月内照常行使职权，并解决最迫切的任务，这应由民族社会党、基督教人民党和斯洛伐克民主党的政府委员完全负责。”宣言指出：某些政党的政府委员不负责任的行为是越来越明显了，他们攻击国家治安机关，借以掩盖和保护目前已形活跃的奸细活动，这种活动已到达少见的程度，且证明了国内外反动势力反对我们共和国的重大阴谋。为民族社会党称颂为“可亲的人们”的这些奸细，从西方被派入我国，已经在从事重建德国秘密总参谋部特务系统的工作。这种由中央政府委员突然挑起的政治危机，造成国外反动势力代理人对共和国的威胁。宣言继称：“民族社会党、基督教人民党和斯洛伐克党十分明显地组成反民主反社会主义的集团，其目的在于推翻人民民主政权，把权力交给反动分子，这三党的此种反动行为，以各该党政府中的部长之辞职而告完成。因此，该三党已自甘为政府纲领的反对派。宣言力称：“共产党领导机关认为必须立即团结一切劳动人民的力量，以支持哥特瓦尔德政府，政府现正镇静地坚持其岗位，并实施一切必要措施以保卫人民的民主事业，和国内的安全、和平与秩序。”宣言最后号召“城乡全体劳动人民、一切工人、农民、商人和自由职业者，以及一切捷克和斯洛伐克人，起来组织巩固的全国统一战线，坚决支持哥特瓦尔德政府，实现一切为共和国利益和我国革命利益所鼓舞的任务，争取与苏联及其他斯拉夫国家的友好同盟关系。”\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】布拉格讯，作为此次捷克政潮导火线的叛国阴谋案内情，已因捷克国防部与内政部二十二日发表的联合公报而渐露真相。该公报称：“叛国阴谋系由为政府追捕已久的凶犯雷却尔所组织，当战时捷克军队在苏联成立时，雷却尔即与在苏联的外国谍报机关勾结，并和支持安德斯的波兰反动分子合作，不久他即开小差回国进行反苏活动，一九四六年因犯罪被告发，潜逃往德境美占区。据侦查结果，雷却尔确与若干卖国之军官有联系，共同密谋推翻民主政府，并与外国军事间谍报保持联系，供给后者情报，接受后者命令，雷却尔已正式开始策划武装暴动。”公报末称：“整个叛国组织已被破获，活动几达两年的罪魁，已悉数被捕。”据悉，叛国阴谋案详细内容，因涉及各外国，尚不能公布。另悉，前副总理斯洛伐克民主党员厄尔辛业已被捕，他在去秋即因叛国嫌疑而辞去副总理之职。"

Both *Truth* and TASS have received a flood of letters supporting the decision. Yekov, a famous pianist and professor at the Moscow Conservatory, said: \"Many musicians believe that their responsibility lies mainly in catering to the tastes of a small circle of music 'connoisseurs.' Most of what they play is formalistic works, which are incomprehensible and superfluous to the vast majority of the audience. They are not ashamed of this fact at all.\" Colonel Mikhailgis said: \"The so-called 'innovators' of Soviet music, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Shebalin, and others, have led Soviet music to a dead end. In the works of these 'innovators,' the unbridled frenzy of noise angers the audience, yet music critics praise these works to the heavens.\" Irina, the president of the Gnessin Music Teacher's College, said: \"The people are deeply satisfied and proud of the Party's decision. Because this decision once again demonstrates the particularly important role of Soviet art, as well as the constant concern of the Party leaders for art. In the Soviet Union, music must be a tool for expressing the ideas of our time, it must deeply attract and truly move the broad masses of listeners. To achieve this goal, the content of the music must be understandable, emotional, and meaningful, and it must be loved by the people. The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee represents the expression of the ardent demands of the entire Soviet people for art, and it is closely related to the source of the people's creative art and the excellent traditions of classical music. The music we need is music that is firmly rooted in the people. The music art we need is a music art that bravely moves forward, not something that uses clever-headed, bizarre things to masquerade as novelty. I am particularly delighted with the Party Central Committee's instruction on developing the classical heritage. We should be educating young people in this direction and cultivating a healthy, young generation of Soviet musicians.\" Titov, an engineer at the Kirov Factory in Leningrad, said: \"The Russian people have a very rich folk song and ballad tradition, but many of our composers have forgotten to draw inspiration from the inexhaustible source of folk art.\" Bakbudaov, an academician of the Leningrad Academy of Sciences, said: \"In the Soviet Union, music must serve the interests of the people and express their thoughts and feelings, but Soviet composers have recently forgotten this basic truth.

Khachaturian said: \"The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee is the expression of the people's will. It expresses the thoughts and feelings that have moved the Soviet people for many years. And it truly and clearly shows the attitude of the Soviet people towards Western musical culture. The Soviet people not only do not reject it, but on the contrary, are willing to become true inheritors of the excellent works of classical music from various eras and countries, but the Soviet people sharply criticize and reject the decadent musical art of modern Western European and American countries, which reflect the decadence of bourgeois culture. The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee will guide Soviet composers and myself on the road of socialist realism in musical art.\" Prokofiev said: \"The decision of the Communist Party Central Committee will become a turning point in the development of Soviet music art, and will help Soviet composers develop realistic tendencies in music creation, especially to help my own creation, overcome formalistic tendencies, so that my future works will be worthy of our people and our great country.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 联共中央的音乐决定全苏联人民热烈拥护  受批评的作曲家　遵照党的指示决心改正错误\n\n1948-02-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　联共中央的音乐决定全苏联人民热烈拥护\n    受批评的作曲家\n  　遵照党的指示决心改正错误\n    【新华社陕北电】莫斯科讯：联共中央公布的关于苏联音乐工作的决定，获得全苏人民的热烈讨论和一致拥护，认为这一决定具有伟大的政治意义。真理报与塔斯社连日收到拥护这一决定的投书，多如雪片。著名钢琴家、莫斯科音乐院教授耶可夫说：“许多音乐家认为他们的责任主要在迎合音乐‘欣赏家’的小圈子的口味，他们所演奏的大多是形式主义的作品，对广大听众是不可理解和多余的。他们对这一事实竟毫不感觉惭愧。”米海尔吉斯上校说：“所谓苏联音乐的‘革新派’萧斯塔可维奇，普罗柯菲也夫，谢巴林等人，把苏联音乐引上绝路，这些‘革新派’的作品中，噪音的狂放不羁，使听众愤怒，音乐批评家们竟把这些作品捧上天去。”格涅辛音乐师范学院院长伊利娜说：“人民对党的决定深感满意，并引以自豪。因为这一决定又一次表明苏联艺术特别重要的作用，以及党领袖对艺术的不断关心。在苏联，音乐必须是表达我们时代思想的工具，它必须深深吸引和真正感动广大的听众。为达到这一目的，音乐的内容必须是能理解的、有感情的、有意义的，是老百姓所喜闻乐见的。联共中央这一决定代表了全苏联人民对艺术的热切要求之表现，并且是与人民创造性艺术的源泉以及古典音乐的优秀传统密切联系着的。我们需要的音乐是牢固地在人民中生根的音乐。我们需要的音乐艺术是勇敢向前进的音乐艺术，而不是以聪明过了头的离奇古怪的东西来冒充新奇。党中央对发展古典遗产这一指示，我特别感到欢欣。我们正应该朝着这个方向去教育青年，培养健康的、年青一代的苏联音乐家”。列宁格勒基洛夫工厂工程师狄托夫说：“俄罗斯人民有非常丰富的民间歌曲与歌谣，但我们有许多作曲家却忘记了从民间艺术的无穷尽的源泉中汲取灵感。”列宁格勒科学院大学士巴克布大奥夫说：“在苏联，音乐必须为人民的利益而服务，表达他们的思想和感情，但苏联作曲家近来却忘记了这一基本真理，苏联作曲家应当响应党的号召”。\n    【新华社陕北电】莫斯科讯：最近受到联共中央严厉批评的苏联作曲家普罗柯菲也夫及哈加杜里阳，日前分向塔斯社记者表示决心遵照党的指示，痛改前非，自拔于形式主义的深渊。哈加杜里阳说：“联共中央的决定是人民意志的表现。它表现了多年来激动着苏联人民的思想与感情。并真实而明确地表明了苏联人民对西方音乐文化的态度。苏联人民不但不摈弃，相反地愿意成为各个时代各个国家古典音乐中优秀作品的真正继承者，但苏联人民尖锐地批评并摈弃近代西欧和美洲各国堕落的音乐艺术，这些音乐反映资产阶级没落文化的颓废性。联共中央的决定将引导苏联作曲家和我本人走向音乐艺术的社会主义现实主义的道路。”普罗柯菲也夫说：“联共中央的决定将成为苏维埃音乐艺术发展的转折点，将帮助苏联作曲家发展音乐创作上现实主义倾向，尤其是帮助我本人的创作，克服形式主义倾向，使我将来的作品无愧于我国人民和我伟大的国家。”"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-02-28",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 26th: According to TASS, New York, the Security Council reconvened on the 19th to discuss the report of the Three-Nation Mediation Committee on the situation in Indonesia. Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a lengthy speech, vehemently criticizing the US imperialist conspiracy to assist Dutch aggression. Gromyko first stated that the Soviet and Ukrainian representatives had urged the Security Council as early as the beginning of 1946 to pay attention to the war launched by Britain and the Netherlands to stifle the Indonesian national liberation movement. The Soviet representative at that time suggested that the troops of both sides withdraw to the positions before the outbreak of the Dutch-Indonesian War. However, the Soviet proposal was resolutely opposed by the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and China (Chiang). As a result, the Dutch aggression in Indonesia was further intensified. The Security Council subsequently neither adopted another Soviet proposal to establish a Security Council Ceasefire Agreement Implementation Committee, nor took any effective and minimal decisions to oppose Dutch aggression. Gromyko continued, stating that the so-called Three-Nation (US, Australia, Belgium) Mediation Committee was, in fact, not a representative body of the Security Council; the committee's activities had consistently ignored the Security Council and were only directed by the governments of the United States, Belgium, and Australia. Gromyko further pointed out that the Netherlands blatantly violated the Security Council's decisions, especially in Madura and Java, where it carried out massacres of peaceful Indonesian residents. The Dutch authorities knew that their atrocities could go unpunished, and the Netherlands used this situation to seize all the most important areas of the Republic of Indonesia. The Dutch-Indonesian \"Renville\" Truce Agreement completely conformed to Dutch interests, and the demarcation of the Van Mook Line meant that the Netherlands gained control over the oil and rubber-rich areas of Java and Sumatra. Only a small part of central Java and the inland mountainous areas of Sumatra were left to the Republic of Indonesia. The Dutch plan to establish the \"United States of Indonesia\" has seriously damaged the interests and sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. Gromyko emphasized that the committee's approval of the agreement was an act of betrayal of the Indonesian people. When Gromyko criticized the reason why the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, and other countries colluded with the Dutch aggressors, he emphasized that US imperialism had significant economic interests in Indonesia and had imported large amounts of oil, lead, rubber, and other important resources from Indonesia. Gromyko stated that it was not surprising that influential people in the United States sympathized with the Netherlands and not with the Indonesian people. In fact, the US representative in the Security Council, when dealing with the fate of the Indonesian people, consistently and viciously intensified the oppression and exploitation of the Indonesian people and suppressed the Indonesian people's independence and liberation movement. Gromyko finally reiterated the Soviet proposal to require the troops of both Indonesia and the Netherlands to withdraw to the positions before the outbreak of the war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏代表葛罗米柯在安理会演说　抨击美帝助荷侵略印尼\n\n1948-02-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏代表葛罗米柯在安理会演说\n  　抨击美帝助荷侵略印尼\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：安理会十九日复会讨论三国调停委员会关于印尼局势的报告。苏联代表葛罗米柯发表长篇演说，猛烈评击美帝助荷侵略之阴谋。葛氏首称：苏联与乌克兰代表远在一九四六年初便敦促安理会注意英、荷为窒息印尼民族解放运动而发动的战事，苏联代表当时建议双方军队撤至印荷战争爆发前的位置；但苏联的建议遭到美、英、法、比和中国（蒋）的坚决反对；结果荷兰在印尼的侵略行动进一步加紧。安理会此后既未采取苏联提出的成立安理会停战协定实施委员会的另一建议，亦未采取任何有效与最低限度的决定，以反对荷兰的侵略。葛罗米柯继称：所谓三国（美、澳、比）调停委员会，事实上不是安理会的代表机构；调委会的活动，一直都不理睬安理会，只受美、比、澳政府所指挥。葛氏进一步指出：荷兰横蛮地违犯安理会的决定，特别是在马都拉、爪哇大肆屠杀印尼和平居民。荷兰当局知道，他们的暴行可以不受惩办，荷兰并利用这一情势攫取印尼共和国一切最重要地区。印荷“伦维尔”停战协定，完全符合于荷兰利益，划定范·穆克分界线，意味着荷兰取得对爪哇及苏门答腊石油与橡胶富藏地区的控制。只有爪哇中部一小部与苏岛内陆山区留给了印尼共和国。荷兰建立“印尼合众国”的计划，已严重地损害着印尼共和国的利益和主权。葛氏强调称：调委会批准该协定，是一种对印尼人民的出卖行为。葛罗米柯抨击美、英、法、比和其他国家勾结荷兰侵略者之原因时，着重指出：美帝国主义对印尼有重大的经济利益，并已自印尼输入大量的石油、铅、树胶和其他重要资源。葛氏称：美国有势力人士同情荷兰而不同情印尼人民，这并不奇怪，事实上，美国在安理会的代表处理印尼人民命运时，一贯为穷凶极恶地加紧对印尼人民的压迫剥削，而镇压印尼人民的独立解放运动。葛罗米柯最后重申苏联要求印荷双方军队撤至战争爆发前的位置之提案。"

Ilyarov denounced these anti-democratic actions as \"arbitrary police actions,\" and strongly criticized the U.S. military authorities for violating the Potsdam Agreement by forcibly hindering progressive people's movements.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. Reports from various sources: The Chiang bandit is actively implementing his American master's aggressive plan to \"develop South China.\" This plan, sent by the U.S. government to the Chiang bandit government in the name of the \"Wedemeyer Recommendations\" in late January, focuses on rapidly \"developing South China's resources and transportation\" and \"hydroelectric projects\" under the complete control of U.S. imperialism, in order to use South China as a so-called \"possible fallback base\" for U.S. aggression against China (United Press). Wedemeyer told the Chiang bandit that if South China's political and economic situation \"stabilized,\" U.S. aid to the Chiang bandit \"would naturally arrive.\" After receiving this \"recommendation,\" the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek immediately convened a meeting of Chiang bandit ministers and officials on January 30th, deciding to accept the \"recommendation\" as the \"primary task\" in the Chiang bandit's overall \"economic recovery\" plan for this year. He also directly discussed it with U.S. Ambassador Stuart, reaching an agreement. U.S. imperialism praised its Chinese running dog, saying, \"The [Chiang bandit] government attaches extreme importance to Wedemeyer's recommendations and has, in fact, put some parts of the recommendations into practice\" (Cooperative News Agency). According to reports, a large-scale plan by the American Penny Lee Company to establish factories and enterprises in South China will begin this summer. The company's manager, Penny, is currently preparing capital and raw materials in the United States. The Chiang bandit authorities in Guangdong Province have also received numerous requests from other American companies to invest in South China. After Truman submitted a special message to the U.S. Congress on aiding Chiang, the Guangdong authorities repeatedly expressed their \"hope\" that their American masters would invest in South China, and advocated moving factories from Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to the south, all under the control of U.S. imperialism. It is reported that more than ten factories operated by Chiang bandit bureaucratic capitalists in Shanghai and Tianjin are preparing to relocate to the south. In Jiangxi, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, the Chiang bandit has decided to classify the Ganzhou tungsten mine and the coal mines in Pingxiang, Anyuan, Gaoyan, and other places as \"state-owned,\" and the Tianhe coal mine as \"province-owned,\" while strengthening control over the province's private coal industries. In addition, according to a dispatch from the Chiang bandit Central News Agency in Fuzhou on the 21st, the American Jiangnan Construction Company has recently joined forces with the Sichuan Zhongyuan Paper Mill to establish a large-scale pulp mill in Fujian, monopolizing Jiangnan pulp manufacturing. The company has now sent seven engineers to Fuzhou to discuss \"technical issues\" with the Chiang bandit authorities and to inspect raw material production and transportation in northern Fujian. Song Ziwen, the general manager selling out South China for the Chiang bandit, arrived in Nanjing on the 19th and will reportedly travel to the United States soon to complete the so-called \"final stage\" of U.S. aid to Chiang negotiations.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. TASS Shanghai, 20th: The U.S. Navy will soon conduct a large-scale exercise in China's East Sea. U.S. Rear Admiral Martin's U.S. fleet has arrived in Hong Kong. The U.S. Imperialist United Press International Shanghai 21st dispatch admitted: Those participating in the exercise include the West Pacific Fleet stationed in Qingdao and the 38th Task Force stationed in Pearl Harbor. The latter fleet is on its way to Hong Kong from Australia. Part of the U.S. fleet in Shanghai has left Shanghai to join the fleet that has sailed from Qingdao. U.S. imperialism keeps the location of the exercise secret. UPI only stated \"somewhere between Okinawa and Hong Kong.\" According to Qingdao sources: The newly appointed commander of the U.S. West Pacific Navy, Badger, arrived in Qingdao on the 19th. The head of the U.S. Naval Delegation in Nanjing, Sebald, and the Chiang bandit acting navy commander, Gui Yongqing, flew from Nanjing to Qingdao on the 21st. On the 24th, Gui shamelessly told reporters from the Associated Press in Qingdao, flattering his American masters, that \"it is very important for the U.S. Navy to stay in Chinese waters,\" and emphasized that Qingdao, as a base for the U.S. West Pacific Fleet, is \"very important\" strategically in the Far East. Gui admitted that he \"had proposed that the West Pacific Fleet use Yantai as a place for summer exercises.\" Regarding the continued presence of U.S. troops in Qingdao, Gui made a shameless defense for U.S. imperialism, saying, \"This depends on the situation in Northeast China, Korea, and Japan.\"\n\nAccording to a Nanjing dispatch: After Wallace revealed in Washington on the 23rd that U.S. imperialism was secretly establishing bases in Qingdao and Taiwan, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing issued a statement on the 24th with a guilty conscience, saying that he \"could not comment.\" The news that U.S. imperialism's navy has invaded China's territorial waters to conduct large-scale exercises and has forcibly occupied Chinese territory to secretly build aggressive bases has aroused great anger among the Chinese people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪积极为主子张罗　美帝加紧侵略华南  美海军将在我国东海面演习\n\n1948-02-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪积极为主子张罗\n  　美帝加紧侵略华南\n    美海军将在我国东海面演习\n    【新华社陕北廿四日电】各方消息：蒋匪正积极执行其美国主子“开发华南”的侵略计划。该计划由美政府以“魏德迈建议”名义于上月下旬送达蒋匪政府，其要点为在美帝全面控制下迅速“开发华南的物资与交通”和“水电工程”，以便将华南作为美帝侵华的所谓“一个可能的后退基地”（合众社）。魏德迈向蒋匪表示，如果华南的政治经济“稳定”，美国对蒋匪的援助“将自然会到来”。匪首蒋介石接到此一“建议”后，立即于上月三十日召开蒋匪各部会长官会议，决定接受该“建议”作为蒋匪今年“经济复兴”总计划中的“首要任务”，并曾与美大使司徒雷登直接商谈，取得协议。美帝称赞其中国走狗说：“（蒋匪）政府极端重视魏德迈的建议，而且实际上已将该建议的某些部分付诸实行”（合作社）。消息称：美国潘尼·李公司在华南建立工厂与企业的大规模计划，将于今夏开始，该公司经理潘尼正在美筹备资本与原料。蒋匪粤省当局且已接到其他大批美国公司投资华南之请求。杜鲁门在美国会提出援蒋特别咨文后，粤当局又重复表示“希望”美国主人投资华南，并主张将沪、津等地工厂南迁，一并放在美帝控制下，据悉，沪、津蒋匪官僚资本经营之十余家工厂已作南迁准备。在江西，蒋匪在美帝授意下，决定将赣南钨矿及萍乡、安源、高垣等地煤矿划为“国营”，天河煤矿划为“省营”，并加强对该省各民营煤业之管制。此外，据蒋匪中央社福州二十一日电讯供讯：美商江南建设公司最近已纠合四川中元造纸厂在福建设立大规模纸浆厂，垄断江南纸浆制造，现该公司已派出工程师七人至福州与蒋匪当局洽商“技术问题”，并至闽北视察原料生产及运输情形。蒋匪出卖华南的总经理人宋子文已于十九日抵达南京，据称彼不久且将赴美国，以完成美帝援蒋谈判的所谓“最后阶段”。\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据塔斯社上海二十日消息：美海军最近将在中国东海面大演习，美海军少将马丁率领之美国舰队已抵香港。美帝合众社上海二十一日消息供认：参加演习的包括驻青岛的西太平洋舰队及驻珍珠港的第三十八特种舰队。后一舰队正由澳大利亚驶港途中，在上海的一部分美舰队已离开上海与驶出青岛的舰队汇合。美帝对演习地点秘而不宣，合众社只称“在冲绳岛与香港之间某地”。另据青岛消息：美帝新任西太平洋海军总司令白吉尔已于十九日抵青。美驻南京海军代表团团长赛柏尔与蒋匪代理海军总司令桂永清二十一日由宁飞青。桂匪二十四日在青对美联社记者发表献媚美国主子的谈话说：“美国海军留在中国海面非常重要”，并强调作为美国西太平洋舰队基地的青岛在远东战略上“十分重要”。桂供认他“曾提议请西太平洋舰队利用烟台为夏季演习地方”。关于美军继续留驻青岛问题，桂为美帝作无耻辩护说：“这要看东北、朝鲜和日本的情况而定”。\n    又据南京讯：华莱士二十三日在华盛顿揭露美帝正秘密建立青岛和台湾基地后，美驻南京大使馆发言人二十四日发表谈话时作贼心虚，说他“不能评论”。美帝国主义海军侵入中国领海大肆演习，和强占中国领土，秘密建筑侵略基地的消息，引起全中国人民的极大愤怒。"

Wang Shize, a former lower-middle peasant, was worried about having his two oxen taken away and given to households without livestock after hearing about the \"draw from the surplus to make up for the deficiency, draw from the fertile to compensate for the barren\" method. Only after hearing that the property of middle peasants would not be touched did he feel relieved and become more motivated in production. On the second day of the first lunar month, the village held a meeting. Li Shunda said, \"Spring is early this year, and there is a lot of work to be done. If we don't hurry up and take advantage of the slack season to transport manure, we will delay planting.\" After a period of discussion, everyone agreed that production should be pushed forward, not delayed, and that they should learn from last year's experience. They immediately divided into three groups, calculated the labor, livestock, and manure of the entire village, and decided to organize to complete the transportation completely before the 13th day, with an inspection on the 15th. After the meeting on the afternoon of the second day, everyone started working on the third day. Wang Shize, Lu Quanze, and others used coal cinder to pave the roads because the snow had melted and the roads were slippery. Li Daze carried manure to the shady slopes in the morning when the snow had not melted, and to the sunny areas in the afternoon. After five days of intensive work, Niu Yongqing's group transported 850 loads, with 400 loads remaining. Li Daze's group transported 900 loads, with 600 loads remaining. Song Maisuo's group transported more than half.

After hearing about the equal distribution of land, he mistakenly thought that middle peasants would be struggled against, so he stopped collecting fertilizer. Later, at a general meeting, he heard someone read the newspaper, which clearly stated that the property of middle peasants would not be touched and that poor and lower-middle peasants were one family. Only then did he understand the Land Law and regretfully said, \"I haven't swept the stubble these past few days. After calculating, I have accumulated three mu less of fertilizer.

With the exception of a small number of special agents and despotic elements, the majority have been released. These secret societies were organized by Si Bingnan and Wang Hengmi, local bullies from Anyang and Tangyin.

The details are as follows: (1) From January 6th to 14th, the local armed forces of the Second Military Sub-district engaged in five battles with bandit units led by Zhou Xiangzhen, Chen Tao, Sun Hongliang, and others in the territories of Taihe, Hao County, Huaiyang, and Luyi Counties, capturing 350 bandits alive and seizing 4 light and heavy machine guns and 104 rifles and pistols. (2) A unit of the Sixth Military Sub-district's local armed forces mopped up local bandits and Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in Mengcheng, Woyang, and Gaoyang Counties. From January 7th to 15th, they won all four battles, killing over 60 bandits, capturing 498 alive, including Ma Congwu, the pseudo-Fifth District Chief of Fuyang, and seizing 314 rifles and 13 warhorses. They destroyed 2 pseudo-district offices and 8 pseudo-township offices.\n　　\nXinhua News Agency, Su, Lu, Yu, and Anhui Front, 25th: The 356th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek bandits, which was annihilated in the fourth battle to capture Lankao, had a significant shortage of personnel, with only about 70 soldiers in each company. Most of them were new recruits conscripted from Kaifeng, Heze, and other places, and many were old, weak, or disabled. A reporter met four newly captured soldiers on the Lankao front, one of whom was a fool, and another was blind in his left eye. When attacking Lankao Railway Station, twelve new soldiers were found wearing military caps but still dressed in civilian clothes in the cave dwellings. Some of the new recruits only knew how to eject bullets, and some did not even recognize ordinary weapons. Xia Kaiyi, a farmer conscripted from Kaocheng, had been a soldier in the regiment for four months but still called anti-tank guns \"big guns.\" When the regiment entered Lankao on the 16th, Liu Ruzhen, the commander of Chiang Kai-shek's 68th Division, told his officers and soldiers: \"Our task is to defend the city on the one hand and train for a month on the other,\" but they were annihilated in just three days.\n　　\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: A unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Liaodong Front commended people's heroes during the Spring Festival. The unit's leaders sent a large number of letters to the heroes to congratulate them on the New Year. Various units held banquets to celebrate the heroes and organized symposiums for everyone to learn from their combat experience. The army newspaper prominently published the annual achievements of each hero squad, platoon, and company: one company annihilated a total of 1,515 enemies in one year, seizing 39 various cannons and 62 light and heavy machine guns. Another company trained 7 company-level cadres, 9 platoon-level cadres, and 54 squad leaders and deputy squad leaders throughout the year. During the Spring Festival, heroes from various units announced their plans to eliminate the enemy in 1948, and countless liberation fighters also expressed their determination to strive to earn the \"Mao Zedong Medal\" this year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫皖苏地方武装半月歼土蒋九百\n\n1948-02-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫皖苏地方武装半月歼土蒋九百\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖二十六日电】迟到消息：豫皖苏二、六两分区地方武装一月份上半月于清剿中，歼灭土著蒋匪九百余名，计：（一）二分区地武一月六日至十四日于太和、毫县、淮阳、鹿邑四县境内先后与周祥祯、陈涛、孙洪亮等匪部作战五次，活捉匪三五○名，缴获轻重机枪四挺、长短枪一○四支。（二）六分区地武一部清剿蒙城、涡阳、皋阳等县土著蒋匪，一月七日至十五日四战皆捷，打死匪六十余名，活捉阜阳伪五区区长马葱武以下四九八名，缴获步枪三一四支，战马十三匹，摧毁伪区署二个，伪乡公所八个。\n    【新华社苏鲁豫皖前线二十五日电】第四次攻克兰封战斗中被歼之蒋匪三五六团，兵员缺额甚多，每连仅七十人左右，且大部是从开封、菏泽等地抓来的新兵，其中老弱残废甚多。记者于兰封前线遇见四个被俘的新兵中，即有一个傻子，一个左目失明。攻克兰封车站时，在窑洞中有十二个新兵头戴军帽身上还穿着便衣。新兵中有的只会装退子弹，有的连普通武器都不识，一个从考城被抓去的农民夏开益在该团当兵四个月，还把战防炮唤做“大枪”。该团在十六日进入兰封时，蒋匪整六十八师师长刘汝珍曾对官兵训话说：“我们的任务是一面担任城防，一面训练一个月”，但不过三天便被歼灭了。\n    【新华社东北二十四日电】辽东前线解放军某部，在春节中表扬人民功臣。该部首长特发出大批信件向功臣们贺年，各单位纷纷欢宴功臣，并召开座谈会组织大家学习战斗经验。部队报纸以显著地位登载各英雄班、排、连的全年战绩：某连在一年中共歼敌一千五百十五名，缴获各种炮三十九门，轻重机枪六十二挺。另连全年曾培养出连级干部七人，排级干部九人，正副班长五十四人。各部英雄并于春节宣布自己在一九四八年的歼敌计划，无数解放战士也纷纷表示决心，争取今年挂上“毛泽东奖章”。"

This campaign was launched on the morning of the 9th and ended on the afternoon of the 22nd. In fourteen days of fighting, the local Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the area were thoroughly eliminated. A total of 24 strongholds were captured, including the central strongholds of the Eastern and Western Line local Chiang Kai-shek bandits, Qianhouzhongwang (40 li northwest of Jiaxian), Zhifang (30 li southeast of Linru), as well as Ciba, Shantouzhao, Shasandian, Huluzhai, Dongxizhaoluo, Taipuzhai, and Wuhuan Store. Over 3,450 bandits were captured alive, including bandit guerrilla battalion commanders Wang Ji, Han Lubin, and Han Laozhong, as well as local bandit leaders Wang Zhongyi, Wang Laotai, Dong Jintang, Li Guixing, Han Tianqi, and Li Gouhui. Eighty-three bandits were killed or wounded. The captured materials included eight machine guns of various types, one small cannon, more than 260 rifles, 72 locally made guns, more than 30 pistols, more than 2,800 rounds of ammunition, 655 broadswords and spears, 124 shovels, and 21 livestock.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 26th: A frontline reporter reported on the great victory in suppressing bandits in the Jiaxian-Linru area north of the Ru River, stating that after we liberated the area along the Ru River, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Zhengzhou and Luoyang sent bandit leader Wang Dongcheng to collude with local habitual bandits Wang Zhongyi and reactionary landlords, big bullies, and secret agents, and coerced a small number of people to carry out rebellion, conducting settling of scores everywhere, and brutally killing peasants and our cadres, which the local people deeply hated. Our army launched a suppression campaign on the 9th of this month, and more than 2,000 emancipated peasants from Jiaxian and Baofeng enthusiastically participated in the war. In the fourteen days, under the combination of our strong military pressure and political offensive, most of the people who were deceived and coerced into participating in the rebellion laid down their weapons. When we captured the bandit stronghold of Taipuzhai, the bandits surrendered completely after hearing our soldiers' shouts. As a result, more than 3,500 bandits in the Jiaxian-Linru area, except for more than 80 who were killed or wounded, surrendered their arms. The democratic government and the Liberation Army, in accordance with a lenient policy, quickly released most of them, and held victory celebration meetings in various villages. Deputy Commissioner Li of the Fifth Administrative Office and Deputy Commander Niu of the military subdistrict attended and spoke, exposing the conspiracies and crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and explaining the democratic government's policy of eliminating harm for the people. On the spot, more than 700 young and strong men from several villages requested training and armed self-defense. The masses on both sides of the Ru River are continuing to investigate bad elements.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 26th: The local armed forces of the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Military Subdistricts, combined with a unit of the Liberation Army, achieved victory in clearing out local Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Yiyang and Yunxian, annihilating a total of 1,785 bandits in four days. (1) The local armed forces of the Third Military Subdistrict, in coordination with a certain unit of the Eastern Line Liberation Army, launched a large-scale campaign to clear out the bandit nests in the Minggao Mountain and Dagaoshan area northwest of Yiyang on the 18th. By the 20th, they had successively captured bandit strongholds such as Yuwang Mountain, Dazhuang Gou, and Jiudian, killing or wounding more than 210 local Chiang Kai-shek bandits below the company commander level, and capturing bandit battalion commanders Wang Guodong, Ding Hailiang, and others, totaling 1,235. They seized four light machine guns and 274 rifles. Another unit of our army killed more than 60 bandits in the Heiyu area, 90 li southwest of Songxian, on the 18th. (2) A unit of the local armed forces of the Fourth Military Subdistrict intercepted more than 1,000 fleeing bandits from Zhechuan at Baizhigou, 110 li north of Yunxian city, on the 18th, seizing one light machine gun and eight rifles. On the 21st, they annihilated a company of the Chiang Kai-shek secret service battalion in Junxian at Caojiadian, 70 li north of Junxian, capturing more than 70 enemies and seizing one machine gun and 72 long and short guns. In addition, more than 100 enemies entrenched in Jingziguan surrendered to us and have now entered the liberated area. (3) A unit of the local armed forces of the Seventh Military Subdistrict annihilated parts of the Chiang Kai-shek county government and security team in Xiping at Hengpo, 30 li southwest of Xiping, on the 19th, capturing more than 70 bandits below the battalion commander level.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Yu-Shaan-E Front, 25th: A unit of the local armed forces of the Third Military Subdistrict cleared out bandits in Mingbaichuan, 150 li southwest of Songxian, on the 19th, capturing more than 200 bandits and seizing more than 120 rifles and locally made guns, and three horses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫陕鄂前线我军作战半个月　歼灭土蒋匪五千五百\n\n1948-02-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫陕鄂前线我军作战半个月\n  　歼灭土蒋匪五千五百\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十六日电】东线解放军一部配合五分区地方武装，在汝河北岸郏县临汝地区剿匪大捷，半个月共歼土蒋匪三千五百三十三名。此役系九日晨发起，至二十二日下午结束。十四天中作战十四次，将该地区土蒋匪彻底肃清，计共攻占东西线土蒋匪中心前后冢王（郏县西北四十里），纸坊（临汝东南三十里）及茨芭、山头赵、沙三店、葫芦寨、东西赵落、太朴寨、武桓店等据点二十四处，生俘匪游击大队长王季、韩路斌、韩老忠，土匪头子王忠义、王老太、董金堂、李贵星、韩天其、李沟会等以下三千四百五十余名，毙伤匪八十三名。缴获各种机枪八挺、小炮一门、步枪二百六十余支、土枪七十二支、手枪三十余支、子弹二千八百余发、大刀与长矛六百五十五把、洋锹一百二十四把，牲口二十一头。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十六日电】前线记者报导汝河北岸郏、临地区剿匪大捷称：自我解放汝河沿岸地区后，郑州、洛阳蒋匪即派匪首王东诚勾结当地惯匪王忠义及反动大地主、大恶霸、特务并胁迫少数群众实行叛乱，到处进行倒算，并残杀农民与我干部，当地人民恨之入骨。本月九日我军发起清剿，郏县、宝丰一带翻身农民两千余人踊跃参战。十四天中，在我强大军事压力与政治攻势结合下，大部被欺骗和被胁迫参加叛乱的分子都放下了武器。我攻占太朴寨匪据点时，匪众听我战士喊话后，即全部投降。因此郏、临一带匪众三千五百余名，除毙伤八十余名外，余均缴械。民主政府及解放军一本宽大政策，大部迅速释放，并召开各村群众祝捷大会。五专署李副专员及分区牛副司令员等均出席讲话，揭露蒋匪阴谋罪恶，并阐释民主政府为民除害的政策，当场某数村就有七百余青壮年要求受训，武装自卫。现汝河两岸群众正继续清查坏人。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十六日电】三、四、七分区地方武装结合解放军一部，清剿伊（阳）、郧（县）等地土蒋匪获胜，四天内共歼匪一千七百八十五名。（一）三分区地方武装，配合东线解放军某部，于十八日向伊阳西北地区之鸣皋山、大皋山一带匪巢大举清剿，至二十日止，先后攻克禹王山、大庄沟、九店等匪据点，毙伤土蒋匪中队长以下二百一十余名，俘匪大队长王国栋、丁海亮以下一千二百三十五名，缴获轻机枪四挺，步枪二百七十四支。另部我军十八日于嵩县西南九十里黑峪地区，毙匪六十余名。（二）四分区地方武装一部，十八日在郧县城北一百一十里之白芝沟，阻击浙川匪顽千余，缴获轻机枪一挺，步枪八支。二十一日在均县北七十里之曹家店歼灭均县蒋匪特务营一个连，俘敌七十余名，缴获机枪一挺，长短枪七十二支，又盘据荆紫关之敌百余，向我投诚，现已开进解放区。（三）七分区地方武装一部，十九日在西平西南三十里衡坡，歼西平蒋匪县府及保安队各一部，俘匪大队长以下七十余名。\n    【新华社豫陕鄂前线二十五日电】三分区地方武装一部，十九日在嵩县西南一百五十里明白川清剿匪顽，俘匪徒二百余，缴步枪土枪一百二十余支，马三匹。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Instructions of the CCP Central Committee on Land Reform and Party Rectification in Old and Semi-Old Areas\n　　(February 22, 1948)\n\n　　(1) According to reports from various regions in recent months, all liberated areas, except for the newly liberated areas since the People's Liberation Army shifted from defense to offense last autumn, should be roughly divided into three categories of regions in all old and semi-old areas, and different work guidelines should be adopted according to the different situations of the three categories of regions.\n\n　　A. The first type of region is where land reform is relatively thorough. Most of these areas have undergone rent reduction and interest reduction, liquidation struggles, and land reform after the May 4th Directive in 1946; some areas have undergone liquidation and land reform; and some areas in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia have undergone land distribution before 1937 and land return in 1940. In these areas, land has been equally distributed, the feudal system no longer exists, and the average amount of land owned by farmers of all classes is not much different. In terms of class situation, except for the Northeast and other areas where land has not been equally distributed for long, landlords and old-style rich peasants have been greatly reduced compared to the past, and some have even been reduced to working farmers or poor people, but there is still a small number of landlords and old rich peasants who occupy more and better land property. Many working cadres in these areas occupy more and better land property. New rich peasants have grown up in these areas, and there are more than old rich peasants. Middle peasants have developed into the majority in these areas, accounting for about 50 to 80 percent of the rural population, of which new middle peasants account for a large number, reaching more than half. The average amount of land owned by middle peasants generally exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by about one-half. Poor and hired peasants have become a minority, accounting for about 10 to 40 percent, of which some have not yet completely turned over, and some have been reduced from landlords and old rich peasants to poor peasants. These areas should be considered as having already equally distributed land, and there is absolutely no need to redistribute it. The remaining problem is to adjust land and some other means of production in a smaller scope by means of replenishment, so that poor and hired peasants who have not yet completely turned over can be supplemented with land and other necessary means of production from the families of landlords, old rich peasants, especially cadres who occupy much more land property than farmers. If it is necessary to extract land from new rich peasants or even some wealthy middle peasants, the consent of the extractees must be obtained before it can be moved. The typical experience of Huangjiachuan in Suide (broadcast by Xinhua News Agency) can be roughly applied to this type of region.\n\n　　B. The second type of region is where land reform is not thorough enough. Among them, some areas have undergone rent reduction and interest reduction, liquidation struggles, and land reform after the May 4th Directive; other areas have undergone liquidation and land reform, but due to various reasons, such as wavering leadership policies, impurity within the party, bureaucracy, commandism, and war conditions, the equal distribution of land is not thorough enough, there are still remnants of the feudal system, and the average amount of land owned by farmers of all classes varies greatly. In terms of class situation, there are more landlords and old rich peasants than in the first type of region, and most of them still occupy more and better land property. Many working cadres occupy more and better land property. There are not many new rich peasants. Middle peasants account for a minority of the population, about 20 to 40 percent, of which new middle peasants also account for a minority. The average amount of land owned by middle peasants generally exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by about one time due to the result of land transfer caused by rent reduction and liquidation. Poor and hired peasants still account for the majority, from 50 to 70 percent, of which the majority have not yet completely turned over. These areas should be considered as having basically implemented equal distribution, but not thoroughly. Therefore, in general, it is not to carry out a comprehensive equal distribution again, but to implement adjustment within a larger scope. Only in certain special places, under the condition that the majority of farmers require and obtain the consent of the middle peasants, should it be redistributed. Because the number of poor and hired peasants in this type of region is the largest and the average land difference is large, moving only the land property of landlords, old rich peasants, and cadres generally cannot meet the requirements of poor and hired peasants, and it is inevitable to extract land from new rich peasants and some middle peasants. Therefore, if the average amount of land owned by middle peasants exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by about one time, a part of the land of middle peasants can be extracted after obtaining their consent, but not more than two-fourths of their total land. In this way, on the one hand, the fluctuation of middle peasants can be reduced, and on the other hand, the average amount of land owned by middle peasants can still be preserved to exceed the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants, but the difference should not be too large. If the average amount of land owned by middle peasants exceeds the average amount of land owned by poor and hired peasants by more than one time and agrees to equal distribution, equal distribution can be implemented. In this type of region, the working methods of land reform workers described in the experience of Huangjiachuan in Suide must also be paid attention to and adopted.\n\n　　C. The third type of region is where land reform is very incomplete. Among them, some areas have also undergone liquidation and land reform, but the work is very bad. Other areas are border areas or recovered areas, and land reform work has not yet been carried out. In all these areas, land has not been equally distributed, the feudal system still exists, land relations and class situations have only undergone some changes, landlords and old rich peasants still occupy a large amount of land property, and poor and hired peasants are still numerous with little land. In these areas, the policy of equally distributing land and completely eliminating the feudal system is fully applicable. The focus of equal distribution should be on confiscating the land property of landlords and requisitioning the surplus land property of rich peasants. For the surplus land of some middle peasants, it can only be extracted and equally distributed after obtaining their consent. If the land owned by some middle peasants only exceeds the average amount of land owned by general farmers by less than 10 percent, it should not be changed. Border areas, if still guerrilla in nature, should be treated as new areas, and the central government's regulations on the main points of land reform in new areas should be applied, and should not be included in this type of area.\n\n　　(2) Whether it is equally distributing land or adjusting land, not only should attention be paid to the difference in the quantity of land, but also to the difference in the quality, yield, and distance of the land; not only should the general cultivated land in rural areas be considered, but also public land, wasteland, black land, land of childless households, etc.; especially illegally seized land property, unfairly distributed land property, and fruits of corruption or encroachment by cadres should be given priority to solving. In this way, the policy of extracting more to compensate less and extracting fertile to compensate barren can be truly realized, and the requirements of poor and hired peasants can be met from many aspects, while at the same time taking care of the interests of middle peasants. In the equal distribution or adjustment of land, it is very important to fully explain the reasons and obtain the consent of the new rich peasants and middle peasants when extracting their land. If they do not agree, they should be conceded to and not be forced.\n\n　　(3) In order to meet the requirements of poor and hired peasants, when implementing land adjustment, priority should be given to supplementing the poor and hired peasants who lack land. Then, for single young adults with complete labor force, they should be supplemented with two shares of land, but if the land is insufficient, they can also be supplemented with less than two shares of land, or not supplemented. For the lonely elderly and widows, because they lack labor force, if the land is insufficient, they can also not be supplemented with two shares of land. For families with many family members, they can also be supplemented less than families with fewer family members. For those with deep rogue habits who are difficult to change for a while, they can also be supplemented less, later, or not supplemented. For such rogues, they should only be given the right to use the land temporarily, not the right to own the land. For those who have recently been reduced from landlords and rich peasants to poor and hired peasants, they can also be supplemented later or not supplemented. In short, we must enable the broad masses of poor and hired peasants to rationally supplement land to benefit production, and should not echo the erroneous idea of absolute egalitarianism. After the land adjustment, for the lonely elderly and widows and poor and hired peasants who still have difficulties that cannot be solved, the government should find other ways to help them solve their difficulties.\n\n　　(4) In the first and second types of regions, in places where farmers have been mobilized and organized, the above provisions should be followed, and the adjustment should be completed before the spring plowing to determine land rights to benefit production. In places where the work has not been done well and it is estimated that the land reform task cannot be completed before the spring plowing, the land reform work should be postponed to after the summer, and it should be guaranteed that this year's land production will belong to the tillers, and the work should be quickly turned to production, party rectification, and the establishment of rural democratic life. In the first and second types of regions, where the work of land adjustment has been done well, land rights should be determined and no longer changed. In the third type of region, the land reform work that has already started should be quickly brought to an end and postponed to after the summer to be carried out again, so as to quickly turn to production and general propaganda and organization work.\n\n　　(5) In the old and semi-old areas, we should prepare to complete the land reform and party rectification tasks in the entire region in a planned way in two to three years (1948 to 1950), and should not be too hasty, resulting in many unnecessary problems. Land reform work and party rectification work are both very meticulous mass work, and the speed of the work must be determined according to the degree of awareness and organization of the masses and the number and strength of leading cadres. The solution of land reform and party rectification problems in each village must be fully deliberated and obtain the consent of the vast majority of people before a decision can be made and action can be taken. It cannot be forcibly resolved by a few people, resulting in the error of commandism. At the same time, for the incorrect opinions that occur among the masses, we must patiently persuade them to realize the leading role of the party, and do not commit the error of tailism.\n\n　　(6) Land reform and party rectification should both adopt the method of wave-like gradual promotion with emphasis. In places where there are no capable leaders or sound work groups, it is better to postpone the launch than to rush for success, resulting in detours. However, in all places where it is decided to launch work, we must concentrate our efforts and complete the work plan on time, and do not delay for too long, which will reduce the enthusiasm of the masses, hinder production, and be unfavorable to the promotion of work. All leaders and work groups leading land reform and party rectification work must be trained, explain the policies, and check their work in a timely manner.\n\n　　(7) The poor peasant leagues are undoubtedly the backbone organization of the peasant masses who resolutely implement land reform and completely eliminate the feudal system. However, in the first type of region where equal distribution has been realized and middle peasants account for the majority, if we also artificially organize poor peasant leagues to lead everything, we will inevitably be separated from the majority and isolate ourselves. Therefore, in these areas, the original farmers' associations should be expanded and the committees of the farmers' associations should be re-elected to enable them to lead various tasks. Where there are no farmers' associations, farmers' associations should be established. In the farmers' associations, poor and hired peasant groups should be established. If poor peasant leagues have already been organized, they should not be immediately announced to be abolished, but the poor peasant leagues should be gradually changed to poor and hired peasant groups in the farmers' associations. In the second type of region, because the equal distribution is not thorough enough, poor and hired peasants still account for the majority, and the independent leading role of the poor peasant leagues has not been lost. Therefore, poor peasant leagues should be organized and made to play a leading role among the farmers, but when organizing, new middle peasants should be absorbed to participate. After the poor peasant leagues are established for a short period of time (such as one or two months), the original farmers' associations should be expanded and the committees of the farmers' associations should be re-elected to enable them to lead various tasks. Where there are no farmers' associations, farmers' associations should be established. After the land adjustment work is completed, the poor peasant leagues can be changed to poor and hired peasant groups. If, in the past land reform, there have been sound farmers' associations led by poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants, or there are smooth conditions to ensure that the committees of the farmers' associations are re-elected to enable poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants to account for two-thirds of the sound leadership to implement land reform work, poor peasant leagues can also not be organized, and only poor and hired peasant groups can be organized in the farmers' associations. In the third type of region, because the equal distribution has not been implemented, the majority of poor and hired peasants have not turned over, and middle peasants still have a wait-and-see attitude towards land reform, we must first organize poor peasant leagues, launch land reform struggles, establish leadership prestige, and after a period of time (such as three or four months), establish farmers' associations including all farmers. Farmers' associations should allow new rich peasants to join, but landlords, old rich peasants, and all speculators should be resolutely refused to join. In all places, after the land reform work and party rectification work are generally completed, general elections should be implemented to establish village people's congresses and re-elect village governments. In the committees of the farmers' associations, in the village people's congresses and government committees, generally, poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants should jointly account for two-thirds, and old middle peasants and other working people should account for one-third.\n\n　　(8) Party rectification work is being carried out in various places and has created many methods. Among them, the method of inviting non-party masses to participate in party meetings and jointly review party members and cadres through party branches is the most sound method. The typical experience of Pingshan County should be taken as a model by various places. In the first and second types of regions, the general feudal forces have been eliminated, and the dissatisfaction of the peasants is often concentrated on a group of party members and cadres who use their political status to do evil and encroach on the fruits of land reform. Therefore, carrying out the work of land adjustment in these areas must be combined with party rectification work, and sometimes it must start from party rectification in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. Adopting the above-mentioned party rectification method of combining party members and non-party masses in meetings, on the one hand, allows the non-party masses participating in the meetings to fully criticize and review the party members and cadres they oppose or support, making them feel that they have communicated with Chairman Mao's party; on the other hand, the party leaders can comprehensively consider the problems based on the opinions of the masses and the situation within the party, distinguish between right and wrong, give fair treatment that should be punished and rewarded, and make both party members and non-party masses feel satisfied; at the same time, they can also absorb the activists who are recommended or supported by the masses to join the party organization. In this way, not only will the party's ranks be rectified, but also the masses' ranks will be rectified, and a democratic life inside and outside the party will be established, which will greatly increase the party's prestige. This method should be implemented in rural areas, in cities, in factories, in the army, in organs, and in schools. Except for the newly consolidated areas, all party branches should be open. All party branches should have non-party masses participate in all meetings that discuss issues related to the interests of the masses, including party criticism and self-criticism meetings, and should not hold secret meetings, in order to break the masses' mysterious feeling about the party's organization and party meetings, expose all the good and bad phenomena within the party to the masses, and be supervised, criticized or supported by the masses. The implementation of this method requires two conditions, one is the soundness of the leadership of the superior party, and the other is that the branch must have several good party member backbones. If the leadership of the leaders of the superior party is not sound, the leadership must be sound first. If certain branches have indeed been ruled by bad elements, or even completely occupied by bad elements, and there are no good party member backbones and it is impossible to carry out transformation, the branch should be dissolved, and the superior leaders should go beyond the organization, directly mobilize the masses, and rely on the poor peasant leagues, poor and hired peasant groups, and farmers' associations to lead land reform and production. After a period of time, re-absorb party members and establish branches. For the party members of the original branch, after the branch is announced to be dissolved, the leaders of the superior party may submit them to the poor peasant league congress or farmer congress for criticism and review according to the situation, and give them the punishment they deserve. Among them, those who are judged by the masses to have committed lighter errors, after a certain period of observation and proof that they have indeed corrected, can still have their party membership restored individually. But this refers to special circumstances. In general, branches always have some good party members. The responsibility of the superior leaders lies in being good at discovering these good party members, relying on them as the backbone, absorbing fresh forces, and transforming the branches, rather than abandoning or ignoring them. Party rectification and cadre review must adopt a serious and cautious attitude. We must not only seriously pay attention to the impure phenomena within the party, but also not forget that the overall situation of our party has been tested for a long time, has great prestige among the masses, and is advancing victoriously. It should be admitted that in the process of war and land reform, a group of class alien elements will inevitably be purged from the party, and at the same time, a large number of revolutionary activists will inevitably flood into the party. Therefore, the party committees of various places should solve the problems separately according to the situation in the party rectification work. Those who have obviously committed serious crimes and have lost the minimum qualifications as a party member should be expelled from the party. Those class alien elements who have infiltrated the party, and those incorrigible degenerates within the party, should be resolutely purged from the party. For those intellectuals or other elements within the party who come from the exploiting class but voluntarily give up their original class position, when they have committed serious mistakes but have not lost the minimum qualifications as a party member, as long as they admit their mistakes, are willing to correct their mistakes, and obtain the consent of the non-party masses, we should adopt an attitude of observation and education, and should not immediately expel them from the party. For party members who have committed minor mistakes, regardless of their origin, the policy of education should be adopted.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中央关于在老区、半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示\n\n1948-02-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中央关于在老区、半老区进行土地改革工作与整党工作的指示\n    （一九四八年二月二十二日）\n    （一）根据各地最近数月的报告看来，各解放区，除了去年秋季人民解放军由防御转入进攻以后解放的新区以外，在所有老区与半老区中，大致应分为三类地区，并应根据三类地区的不同的情况，采取不同的工作方针。\n    甲、第一类地区，是土地改革较为彻底的地区。其中，大多数地区，是经过了减租减息、清算斗争和一九四六年五四指示以后的土地改革；一部分地区，经过了清算和土地改革；而陕甘宁的一部分地区则经过了一九三七以前的分地及一九四○年的归地。在这些地区，土地已经平分，封建制度已不存在，农民各阶层占有土地的平均数相差不多。阶级情况，除了东北及其他平分不久的地区尚有不同外，地主与旧式富农均比过去大为减少，且有已下降为劳动农民或贫民者，但尚有一小部分地主旧富农占有较多较好的土地财产。这类地区的工作干部有许多人占有较多较好的土地财产。这类地区，新富农已经生长，且有多过旧富农者。中农在这类地区已发展为多数，从乡村人口的百分之五十到八十上下，其中，新中农占很大数量，有达一半以上者。中农所有土地的平均数，一般超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数约二分之一上下。贫雇农变为少数，从百分之十到四十上下，其中尚有若干未彻底翻身者，亦有由地主旧富农下降为贫农者。这类地区，应被认为土地已经平分，决无再行平分的必要。留下的问题是在较小的范围内，用抽补方法调剂土地及一部分其他生产资料，使尚未彻底翻身的贫雇农从地主旧富农尤其是占有超过农民很多的土地财产的干部家庭那里补进土地及其他必需的生产资料。如果需要抽出新富农甚至一部分富裕中农的土地时，必须取得被抽者的同意，方可抽动。绥德黄家川的典型经验（即由新华社广播），可以大致应用于这类地区。\n    乙、第二类地区，是土地改革尚不彻底的地区。其中，一部分地区，经过了减租减息，清算斗争与五四指示后的土改；另一部分地区，经过了清算和土改，但均由于各种原因，例如领导方针动摇，党内不纯，官僚主义，命令主义及战争情况等，致使土地平分尚不彻底，封建制度尚有残余，农民各阶层占有土地的平均数相差较大。阶级情况，地主旧富农较第一类地区为多，大都仍占有较多较好的土地财产。工作干部中许多人占有较多较好的土地财产。新富农尚不多。中农占人口的少数，约为百分之二十到四十上下其中新中农亦占少数。中农所有土地的平均数，因减租清算致土地转移的结果，一般超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数达一倍上下。贫雇农仍占多数，从百分之五十到七十上下，其中多数尚未彻底翻身。这类地区，应被认为平分已大体实施，但不彻底。因此，一般地也不是再来一次全面的平分，而是实行在较大范围内的调剂。只在某些特殊地方，在多数农民要求并取得中农同意的条件之下，应当重新平分。由于这类地区贫雇农人数最多而土地平均差额又较大，单动地主旧富农及干部的土地财产，一般不能满足贫雇农的要求，势非抽动新富农及一部分中农的土地不可。因此，凡中农所有土地的平均数超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数在一倍上下者，在取得本人同意以后，可以抽出中农的一部分土地，但以不超过其全部土地的四分之二为限度。如此，一方面可使中农波动面不致太大，另一方面仍可保存中农所有土地的平均数超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数，但又不致相差太大。如果中农所有土地的平均数超过贫雇农所有土地的平均数在一倍以上，并赞成平分时，可以实行平分。在这类地区，绥德黄家川经验中所述土改工作人员的工作方法，亦必须注意采用。\n    丙、第三类地区，是土地改革很不彻底的地区。其中，一部分地区虽然也经过了清算和土改，但是工作很坏。另一部分地区，则是边沿区或收复区，土改工作尚未进行。所有这些地区，土地并未平分，封建制度依然存在，土地关系及阶级情况仅有若干变动，地主旧富农仍占有大量的土地财产，贫雇农仍然是人多地少。在这类地区，完全适用平分土地彻底消灭封建制度的方针。平分的重点，应放在没收地主土地财产及征收富农多余的土地财产上面。对于一部分中农的多余土地，必须在取得其同意以后，方能抽出平分。如果某些中农所有土地较一般农民所有土地的平均数只超出百分之十以下者，应不变动。边沿区，如尚带游击性质，应作新区看待，适用中央关于新区土改要点的规定，不应列入此类地区。\n    （二）不论是平分土地或调剂土地，不但应注重土地数量的差别，还应注重土地的质量、产量及其位置远近的差别；不但应从农村的一般耕地着眼，还应从公地、荒地、黑地、绝户地等着眼；尤其是非法强占的土地财产，分配不公的土地财产及干部贪污或侵占的果实，更应首先注意解决。如此，才能真正实现抽多补少、抽肥补瘦的平分方针，才能从多方面设法满足贫雇农的要求，而同时又照顾了中农的利益。在平分或调剂土地中，对于在抽动新富农及中农的土地时必须充分说明理由取得本人同意一点，甚为重要。如果本人不同意，则应向他们让步，不得采取强制办法。\n    （三）为着满足贫雇农的要求，在实行调剂土地时，应首先补足缺地较多的贫雇农。然后，才对于有完全劳动力的青壮年单身汉，补足其两人份的土地，但如土地不足时，亦可补给较两人份为少的土地，或者不补。对于孤老寡妇，因其缺乏劳动力，在土地不足时，亦可不补给两人份的土地。对家庭人口多的，亦可较家庭人口少的少补。对流氓习气很深一时难望改好者，也可少补，后补，或不补。对于此种流氓，暂时应只给与土地使用权，不给予土地所有权。对于由地主富农下降的贫雇农为时不久者，亦可后补，或不补。总之，要使广大贫雇农群众能合理地补足土地，以利生产，而不应附和绝对平均主义的错误思想。在调剂土地以后，对于孤老寡妇及贫雇农中仍有困难不能解决者，政府应另行设法帮助其解决困难。\n    （四）在第一第二两类地区中，在农民已经发动和组织起来的地方，目前应依上述各项规定，于春耕前实行调剂完毕，确定地权，以利生产。在工作尚未做好估计春耕前已不可能完成土改任务的地方，即应将土改工作推迟至夏季以后进行，并保证今年的土地生产物归耕者所有，而将工作迅速转入生产、整党和建立乡村民主生活上去。在第一第二两类地区中，调剂土地的工作已经做好的地方，即应确定地权，不再变动。在第三类地区中，更应将已着手的土改工作赶快作一结束，推迟至夏季以后重新进行，以便迅速转入生产及一般的宣传组织工作。\n    （五）在老区半老区，应准备以二年到三年时间（一九四八年至一九五零年）有计划地完成全区域的土改与整党任务，而不应操之过急，致发生许多不应有的毛病。土改工作与整党工作，均是很细致的群众工作，必须依据群众的觉悟程度与组织程度，领导干部的多少强弱，决定工作的速度。每一个乡村土改与整党问题的解决，均必须酝酿成熟，取得绝大多数人的同意，方能作出决定，采取行动，不能由少数人强制解决，致犯命令主义的错误。同时，对于群众中发生的不正确意见，又必须耐心说服，实现党的领导作用，不要犯尾巴主义的错误。\n    （六）土改与整党，均应采取有重点的波浪式的逐步推广的方法。凡无得力的领导者或健全的工作团的地方，宁可暂缓发动，不要急于求成，致走弯路。但是在一切决定发动工作的地方，又要集中力量，按期完成工作计划，不要拖延太久，致使群众情绪减低，既碍生产，又不利于工作的推进。对于一切领导土改与整党工作的领导者及工作团，均必须加以训练，讲明政策，并要适时地检查他们的工作。\n    （七）贫农团无疑是农民群众中坚决实行土地改革彻底消灭封建制度的骨干组织。但是在第一类地区平分已经实现、中农已占多数的情况下，如果也要人为地组织贫农团去领导一切，势必脱离多数，孤立自己。因此，在这类地区，应就原有的农会加以扩充，并改选农会的委员会，使其能领导各项工作。原来无农会者，应成立农会。在农会中，成立贫雇农小组。如果贫农团已经组织起来，则不应马上宣布取消，而应使贫农团逐渐改为农会中的贫雇农小组。在第二类地区，因为平分尚不彻底，贫雇农仍占多数，贫农团的独立领导作用尚未失去，因此应该组织贫农团，并使其在农民中起领导作用，但在组织时，应吸收新中农参加。在贫农团成立一个短时期（例如一二个月）以后，即应就原有农会加以扩充，改选农会的委员会，使其能领导各项工作。原来无农会者，即应成立农会。在土地调剂工作完成以后，贫农团即可改为贫雇农小组。如果在过去土地改革中业已成立有贫雇农及新中农领导的健全的农会，或者有顺利条件能够保证改选农会的委员会使贫雇农及新中农占三分之二实施土改工作的健全领导的地方，亦可不组织贫农团，而只于农会中组织贫雇农小组。在第三类地区，因为平分尚未实施，贫雇农占多数尚未翻身，中农对土改尚存观望心理，必须首先组织贫农团，发动土改斗争，树立领导威信，一个时期（例如三四个月）以后，再成立包括全体农民在内的农会。农会应容许新富农入会，但对地主、旧富农及一切投机分子，则应坚决拒绝其入会。在一切地方，在土改工作与整党工作大致完成以后，即应实行普选，成立乡村人民代表大会，并改选乡村政府，在农会的委员会中，在乡村人民代表大会及政府委员会中，一般地贫雇农新中农应合占三分之二，旧中农及其他劳动分子应占三分之一。\n    （八）各地整党工作正在开展，并创造了许多方法。其中，以经过党的支部，邀集党外群众参加党的会议，共同审查党员及干部的方法，为最健全的方法。平山县的典型经验，应为各地所取法。在第一第二类地区，一般的封建势力业已消灭，而农民中的不满常常集中于一批利用政治地位为非作恶、侵占土改果实的党员及干部身上。因此，在这些地区进行调剂土地的工作，必须与整党工作相结合，有时还须从整党开始，才能发动群众的积极性。采用上述党员与党外群众结合开会的整党方法，一方面，使参加会议的党外群众能够尽情地批判与审查他们所反对的或赞成的党员及干部，使他们感觉到他们已与毛主席的党通了气；另方面，党的领导者又可根据群众意见及党内情况，全面地考虑问题，分别是非轻重，给以应罚应奖的公平的处置，使党内外群众均感觉满意；同时，又可以吸收被群众所推荐的或拥护的积极分子加入党的组织。如此，既整顿了党的队伍，又整顿了群众的队伍，建立起党内外的民主生活，将极大地提高党的威信。此种方法，在农村中，在城市中，在工厂中，在军队中，在机关和学校中，均应实行。除尚未巩固的新区以外，一切党的支部，均应公开。一切党的支部，在其讨论有关群众利益的问题的一切会议上，包括党的批评检讨会议在内，均应有党外群众参加，不许开秘密会议，借以破除群众对党的组织与党的会议的神秘感觉，使党内一切好的与坏的现象暴露于群众之前，为群众所监督，为群众所批评或拥护。实行这种方法，需要两个条件，一个是上级党的领导的健全，一个是本支部要有几个好的党员骨干。如果上级党的领导者的领导不健全，便须先健全领导。如果某些支部确已为坏分子所统治，甚或全部为坏分子所盘据，没有好的党员骨干，无法进行改造时，就应解散这个支部，上级领导者就应超过该组织，直接动员群众，依靠贫农团、贫雇农小组及农会，领导土改与生产。这样经过一个时期之后，重新吸收党员，建立支部。对于原支部的党员，在该支部被宣布解散以后，上级党的领导者得依情况将他们提交贫农团大会或农民大会予以批判和审查，并给以应得的处分。其中，经群众评定认为错误较轻的分子，经过一定时期的考察，证明其确已改正者，仍可个别地恢复党籍。但这是指特殊的情况。一般的支部，总有若干好党员。上级领导者的责任，就在善于发现这些好党员，并依靠他们为骨干，吸收新鲜力量，改造支部，而不要抛弃或不理他们。整党审干，必须采取严肃而又谨慎的态度。我们既要严肃地注视党内不纯的现象，又要勿忘我党的整个情况是业已经过长期考验，在群众中有了极大威信，并正在胜利前进中。应当承认，在战争和土改的过程中，一定会有一批阶级异己分子从党内清洗出去，同时又一定会有大批的革命积极分子涌进党来。因此，各地党委在整党工作中，应当分别情况，解决问题。对于那些显然犯有重大罪恶、业已丧失作为一个党员的起码资格的分子，应当开除出党。对于那些混进党内的阶级异己分子，对于那些不可救药的党内蜕化分子，均应坚决清洗出党。对于那些虽然是从剥削阶级出身但是自愿放弃其原来的阶级立场的党内的知识分子或其他分子，在他们犯有严重错误，但尚未丧失当作一个党员的起码资格的时候，只要他们承认错误，愿意改正错误，并获得党外群众同意，我们就应采取考察和教育的态度，而不要马上开除出党。对于那些犯有较轻错误的党员，不谕其出身如何，均应采取教育方针。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau's Instructions on Land Reform, Party Rectification, and Democratic Movement\n(I) Based on the land reform situation in our region, it can be divided into three types of areas: The first type of area is where landlords and old rich peasants have been thoroughly eliminated, and the vast majority of poor and hired peasants have completely turned over (accounting for more than 80% of their own class). Land has long been equally distributed, that is, the Land Law Outline has actually been largely realized. In this type of area, new and old middle peasants account for more than 80% of the total number of households in the village. Because the poor and hired peasants here generally turned over earlier and more thoroughly, they have accumulated more wealth, and their political and class consciousness is also higher. The poor and hired peasants who have not completely turned over only account for a very small number, and they have also received the fruits of land reform, but they are not very satisfied and need a little supplementation. This type of area is the best working area in our region, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total population of the region. The second type of area is where landlords and old rich peasants have also been largely overthrown, and land has also been largely equally distributed. The degree of turnover of poor and hired peasants is slightly less than that of the first type of area, with about 60% to 70% of their own class having already turned over. However, because they have not turned over for long, they have little accumulation, and their political and class consciousness is also relatively poor. In this type of area, new and old middle peasants account for about 60% to 70% of the total number of households in the village, and poor and hired peasants who have not completely turned over or have not turned over also account for a minority. This type of area is a medium working area in our region, accounting for slightly more than one-third of the total population of the region. The third type of area is where, although mass movements have been carried out, they are scattered, unsystematic, and of short duration, so landlords and old rich peasants have not been thoroughly overthrown, and most of the poor and hired peasants have not completely turned over or have not turned over, and the land problem has not been fundamentally resolved. This type of area is a weak working area in our region, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total population of the region.\n\n　　In the first two types of areas, the degree of thoroughness of land reform is not much different, that is, they have largely achieved equal distribution. The main remaining problems are: some cadres and party members have protected landlords and rich peasants who have not been thoroughly overthrown, some military cadres and families of revolutionary martyrs who are landlords and rich peasants have retained more land and property, and non-landlord and rich peasant military cadres and families of revolutionary martyrs have been given more land and property, and many cadres have occupied more land and property. If this specific situation is disregarded, and only land problems are circled, and another equal distribution movement is carried out, not only will a fervent mass movement not be launched, but also left-leaning errors will inevitably occur (such as forcibly squeezing feudal elements, not leaving landlords with a living, only leaving rich peasants with bad land, randomly attacking middle peasants, touching the floating wealth of wealthy middle peasants, infringing on industry and commerce, etc.). Therefore, in the first two types of areas, there should be no more equal distribution movement. Measures such as drawing from the surplus to compensate for the deficit, drawing from the fat to compensate for the lean, filling in the gaps, and moving a few without moving the majority can be taken to solve the remaining land problems. Moreover, the filling and supplementation should be combined with party rectification and the establishment of a people's congress democratic movement from the village to the county level, and non-party poor and hired peasants and middle peasants can be absorbed to participate in the party branch meetings, so that the party branch meetings and mass meetings are combined into one, in order to make the party branch public, and conduct class investigation, ideological investigation, position investigation, work style investigation, and behavior investigation, and handle bad cadres and bad party members under the opinions of the masses to complete the party rectification task. In this kind of meeting, the combination of party rectification and supplementation with the democratic movement (actually rectifying the landlord and rich peasant elements within the party and the landlord and rich peasant ideology and its influence) combines the internal solution of the party with the mass solution, and the internal criticism of the party with the pressure of the masses. Because the democratic movement of party rectification in the old areas is an inseparable matter from eliminating feudal remnants, and the democratic movement has a broader mass base, leaving this base or mechanically stipulating that land reform should be carried out first and then democracy cannot have a broad mass movement.\n\n　　Regarding organizational forms, in the first type of area, do not organize poor peasant leagues and poor peasant groups, or only organize poor peasant groups in the peasant associations to protect the interests of the few poor and hired peasants who have not yet completely turned over. If a very small number of poor and hired peasants (and most of them are old, weak, and honest) are forcibly organized into poor peasant leagues to act as the core backbone and play the role of leading everything, it is very difficult and there is a risk of offending the middle peasants. Therefore, this type of area should only organize peasant associations and skillfully and fully utilize the form of peasant representative conferences. However, in the peasant association committees, peasant representative conferences, and village (township) governments, as well as in the process of the democratic movement for party rectification, it should be ensured that two-thirds of the poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants participate, and old middle peasants should not exceed one-third. In the second type of area, poor peasant leagues can be organized, composed of poor and hired peasants who have not turned over and have not completely turned over, and new middle peasant groups (⑴⑵) are absorbed to protect and represent their interests. At the same time, it should be ensured that poor and hired peasants and new middle peasants account for two-thirds in the peasant association committees, peasant representative conferences, and village (township) governments, and old middle peasants should not exceed one-third. In the third type of area, the Land Law Outline can be fully followed, and poor peasant leagues can be organized to play the role of leading everything. However, it is necessary to pay great attention to uniting the middle peasants, and no adventurous policies should be taken towards the middle peasants.\n\n　　(II) When classifying classes, all localities generally err on the side of excessive leftism in determining the targets of struggle. Class investigation should not be based on the few years before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, but should trace back three generations (it is permissible to ask about the father and grandfather when examining the ideology of cadres who have left production). If the person himself started engaging in main labor until now in the few years before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, it is wrong to still classify him as a landlord or rich peasant. It is also wrong to classify intellectuals who engage in mental labor without relying on feudal exploitation as landlords or rich peasants. Or it is wrong to put on the hat of landlord or rich peasant based on the person's poor political attitude, chaotic sexual relations, or problems with work style; or it is even more wrong to deliberately expand the scope of struggle and deliberately classify middle peasants as rich peasants, or even landlords, in order to distribute more floating wealth. In the future, when classifying classes and determining components, we can only use the standards of whether each person possesses the means of production, how much they possess, and the production relations (exploitative relations) associated with possession. There can be no other standards (such as so-called political attitude, whether life is affluent, whether work style is good or bad, etc.). Regarding the issue of component transformation, if a landlord has already transferred to labor or other components for one year before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, or has already transferred to labor or other components for five years after the establishment of a democratic government in the local area; if an old rich peasant has already transformed into other components for one year before the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, or has already transformed into other components for three years after the establishment of a democratic government in the local area, their components should be changed according to their transformed situation. There should be a distinction between landlords and rich peasants. Landlords do not labor or do not participate in main labor, while rich peasants participate in main labor. There should be a distinction between rich peasants and wealthy middle peasants. Those whose income from exploitation accounts for more than 25% of their total income are rich peasants, and those whose income from exploitation accounts for less than 25% are wealthy middle peasants. Those wealthy middle peasants who have minor exploitation (such as partnering with others to hire sheep workers, cattle workers, hire short-term workers, or lend a small amount of debt, etc.) should still be counted as wealthy middle peasants, but not as rich peasants. Therefore, when classifying classes, it is necessary to effectively prevent and overcome left-leaning errors, and it is necessary to listen to the opinions of the masses as much as possible, and adopt the method of self-reporting, public discussion, and three-way finalization. Not only must it be discussed and passed by the poor peasant league, but it must also be discussed and passed by the peasant association, and finally passed by the village representative assembly. In order to achieve fairness, reasonableness, and everyone's approval.\n\n　　(III) After the cadre conference of the entire region, various localities have a wrong understanding of relying on poor and hired peasants to unite middle peasants. When emphasizing the poor and hired peasant line, the phenomenon of blindly advocating poor and hired peasants has occurred. In the future, the term \"poor and hired peasant line\" should no longer be used, because it is very likely to relax the unity of middle peasants and isolate poor and hired peasants. It will confuse the mass line with the poor and hired peasant line. The mass line is the class line, which is specifically manifested in relying on poor and hired peasants to unite middle peasants and all anti-feudal elements. When establishing people's congresses at all levels, it is necessary to unite all anti-feudal elements, because the nature of the new democratic government is not only to represent the peasants, let alone only to represent the poor and hired peasants, but to represent all working people (workers, peasants, independent industrialists and merchants, intellectuals engaged in mental labor, etc.) and the petty bourgeoisie (middle bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie), as well as enlightened gentry, etc. The poor peasant league must obtain the consent of the middle peasants in doing things, not formal consent, but real consent. Therefore, the poor peasant league must make concessions to the middle peasants on certain issues. When Chairman Mao talked about the two basic principles of land reform in \"The Current Situation and Our Tasks,\" he pointed out: \"First, we must satisfy the demands of the poor and hired peasants. This is the most basic task of land reform. Second, we must resolutely unite the middle peasants and not harm the interests of the middle peasants.\" and the five specific policies for uniting the middle peasants must be carefully studied and implemented without compromise.\n\n　　(IV) It is successful to emphasize criticism and self-criticism after the conference, for example, in the past, we did not listen to the opinions of poor and hired peasants enough, and now we have corrected it to listen to the opinions of poor and hired peasants, which is good. However, the \"Keri Kong\" phenomenon of blindly advocating poor and hired peasants has arisen, and tailism that violates Marxism-Leninism and abandons leadership has occurred. We only blindly worship and approve the poor and hired peasants, do not criticize their mistakes, and completely abandon the leadership of the Party. This shows that many comrades have weakness and lack of principle, and dare not uphold the truth. In the past, various regions have made similar mistakes, such as emphasizing the release of the masses and not pouring cold water, which is undoubtedly completely correct, but when the movement made left-leaning killing mistakes, they still adhered to the attitude of never correcting deviations, causing the movement to fall into a state of anarchy, unorganization, unplanned, undisciplined, completely made the tail of backward thoughts, and we suffered a great loss (such as in some areas of northern Henan and southern Shanxi). It should be known that the opinions of the peasant masses are relatively simple, relatively simple, relatively vivid, relatively original, and relatively one-sided. The task of the Party is to both learn from the masses and improve the masses. For example, it has recently been discovered that the peasants disagree with us on several issues: (A) In order to distribute more land and floating wealth, they deliberately increase the components of others; (B) They disagree with the same share of land being distributed to landlords; (C) They want to attack the industry and commerce of landlords and rich peasants; (D) They want to move the floating wealth of middle peasants, do not give middle peasants production loans, forcibly borrow middle peasants' livestock and vehicles for production, and increase the burden on middle peasants, etc. For the fundamental and long-term interests of the peasant masses, we cannot compromise on these four issues, and we must educate and persuade the peasants not to do so.\n\n　　(V) Since this filling movement is carried out in conjunction with party rectification and the democratic movement, we lack experience in this regard. Also, since the task of land reform and party rectification cannot be completed before the spring plowing (strive to complete it but it is impossible), if it is universally launched, it will inevitably delay the spring plowing and will not be thorough, which will be harmful to future work. We are considering taking the method of focused advancement before the spring plowing. Each prefecture committee area only selects one or two counties, concentrates all the strength of the prefecture committee area to take a breakthrough point to obtain experience, educate the masses, educate the cadres, popularize the overall situation, and develop in a wave-like manner, so that the filling, party rectification, and democracy can be done well. Create experience, and then fully launch the movement after the spring plowing. The advantage of this method is that it can create experience, make fewer mistakes, and will not delay spring plowing. It can also solve the difficulty of the lack of cadres caused by the reorganization of the troops.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　February 1, 1948\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共晋冀鲁豫中央局关于土地改革整党与民主运动的指示\n\n1948-02-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共晋冀鲁豫中央局关于土地改革整党与民主运动的指示\n    （一）根据我区土地改革情况，可分为三类地区：第一类地区，地主与旧富农已经彻底消灭，贫雇农绝大部分已经彻底翻身（占其本阶层百分之八十以上），土地早已平分，即实际上早已大体实现了土地法大纲，这类地区新老中农合计占全村户数百分之八十以上，因为这里的贫雇一般翻身较早与彻底，所以积蓄较多，政治觉悟与阶级觉悟亦较高，没有彻底翻身的贫雇农，只占极少数，也分得了土地改革的果实，但尚不十分满意，需稍加填补。这类地区是我区工作最好的区域，约占全区人口三分之一弱。第二类地区，地主旧富农大体上亦已斗彻底，土地亦大体平分过，贫雇农翻身程度稍逊于第一类地区，已经翻身者约占其本阶层的百分之六十到七十。但因其翻身不久，故积蓄不多，政治觉悟与阶级觉悟亦较差。这类地区新老中农合计约占全村户数百分之六十到百分之七十，未彻底翻身与未翻身的贫雇农亦占少数。这类地区在我区工作是中等区域，约占全区人口三分之一强。第三类地区，虽也经过群众运动，但因是零星的，不系统的，时间较短的，所以地主与旧富农未斗彻底，贫雇农大部未彻底翻身或未翻身，土地问题基本上没有解决。这类地区是我区工作薄弱的区域，约占全区人口三分之一弱。\n    在前两类地区中，土地改革的彻底程度相差无几，即大体上均已实现了平分，主要遗留下的问题是：有些干部党员所包庇的地主富农没有斗彻底，有些地主富农成份的军干烈属多留土地财物，与非地主富农之军干烈属多分土地财物，以及不少干部多占土地财物。如不顾这一具体情况，只在土地问题上打圈子，再来一次平分运动，不但发动不起热烈的群众运动，而且一定会发生左倾错误（如硬挤封建，不给地主留生活，只给富农留坏地，乱斗中农，动富裕中农的浮财，侵犯工商业等）。因此，在前两类地区中，不应再来一次平分运动，可采取抽多补少，抽肥补瘦，填平补齐，动少数不动多数的办法，以解决遗留下的土地问题，而且应将填补与整党及建立从村到县的人民代表大会的民主运动结合进行，并可吸收非党员的贫雇农与中农参加党的支部大会，使党的支部大会与群众大会结合为一，借以公开党的支部，并进行查阶级、查思想、查立场、查作风与查行为，在群众意见下处理坏干部坏党员，完成整党任务。在这种大会上，把整党填补与民主运动（实际是整党内的地主富农分子与地主富农思想及其影响）结合起来，把党内解决与群众解决、党内批评与群众压力结合起来。因为老区整党的民主运动与肃清封建残余是不可分离的一件事，而民主运动则有更广大的群众基础，离开这个基础或机械的规定先进行土改，后进行民主，都不能有广泛的群众运动。\n    关于组织形式，在第一类地区，不组织贫农团与贫农小组，或只在农会中组织贫农小组，以保护少数尚未彻底翻身的贫雇农的利益。如硬要把十分少数的贫雇农（且多系老弱老实者）组织成贫农团来作核心骨干，起领导一切的作用，则十分勉强，且有冒犯中农的危险。所以这类地区应只组织农会，并熟练的充分的运用农民代表会的方式。但在农会委员会，农民代表会与村（乡）政府中以及在整党的民主运动过程中，应保证有三分之二的贫雇农和新中农参加，旧中农不得超过三分之一。在第二类地区，可组织贫农团，由未翻身与未彻底翻身之贫雇农并吸收新中农组（⑴⑵）成之，保护并代表他们的利益。同时应保证在农会委员会、农民代表会与村（乡）政府中，贫雇农与新中农共占三分之二，旧中农不得超过三分之一。在第三类地区，可完全按照土地法大纲进行，并组织贫农团起领导一切的作用。但必须十分注意团结中农，绝不许对中农采取任何冒险政策。\n    （二）各地在划阶级时，首先在确定斗争对象上一般失之过左。查阶级不是以当地有民主政权前几年为准，而是追三代（在审查脱离生产干部的思想时，追问其父亲及其祖父是可以的），如其本人在当地有民主政权前几年，即开始从事主要劳动至现在者，仍划为地主富农是错误的。将从事脑力劳动，而不依靠封建剥削的知识分子划为地主富农，也是错误的。或根据其本人政治态度不好，或两性关系太乱，或作风有毛病，就给戴上地主富农帽子，也是不对的；或为多分浮财，便故意扩大斗争面，故意将中农划为富农，甚至地主，则更是错误的。今后划阶级确定成份时只能按照各人占有生产手段与否？占有多少及与占有关系相连带的生产关系（剥削关系）为标准，再不能有任何其他的标准（如所谓政治态度如何，生活富裕与否，作风好坏等）。关于成份转化问题，地主在当地民主政权成立以前，已经转入劳动，或其他成份满一年者，或在当地民主政权成立以后，已经转入劳动或其他成份满五年者；旧富农在当地民主政权成立以前已经转变为其他成份满一年者，或在当地民主政权成立以后已经转变为其他成份满三年者，应依其转变后的情况，改变其成份。地主与富农要有区别，地主是不劳动，或不参加主要劳动，富农是参加主要劳动的。富农与富裕中农要有区别，靠剥削收入的部分，占其总收入百分之二十五以上者为富农，百分之二十五以下者为富裕中农。富裕中农中有较轻微剥削者（如与别人合伙请羊工、牛工、雇短工或放少数债等），仍应算做富裕中农，而不能算做富农。因此，在划阶级时，必须切实防止与克服左倾错误，必须多多听取群众意见，采取自报公议三傍定案的办法，不仅要经过贫农团讨论通过，而且必须经过农会讨论通过，并最后经过村民大会通过。以便达到公平合理，大家赞成。\n    （三）全区干部大会后，各地对依靠贫雇农团结中农有错误了解，强调贫雇路线时，发生盲目鼓吹贫雇农的现象，今后可再不用贫雇路线的字眼，因它很可能放松对中农的团结，使贫雇农孤立，它会把群众路线混同于贫雇路线。群众路线即阶级路线，具体表现在依靠贫雇农团结中农及一切反封建分子上。在建立各级人民代表大会时，要联合一切反封建分子，因为新民主主义政权性质，不只是代表农民，更不只是代表贫雇农，而是代表一切劳动群众（工人、农民、独立工商业者、脑力劳的知识分子等）与中小资产阶级（中等资产阶级、小资产阶级）以及开明士绅等。贫农团办事一定要取得中农同意，不是形式的，而是真正的同意，因此贫农团在某些问题上必须向中农让步。毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”中讲到土改的两条基本原则时指出：“第一，必须满足贫农与雇农的要求，这是土地改革的最基本的任务。第二，必须坚决团结中农，不要损害中农利益”以及团结中农的五项具体政策必须仔细研究，不折不扣的付诸实行。\n    （四）大会后强调批评与自我批评是有成绩的，比如过去倾听贫雇农的意见不够，现在改正过来，要倾听贫雇农的意见，这是好的。但又产生盲目鼓吹贫雇农的“客里空”现象，而发生了违背马列、放弃领导的尾巴主义。对贫雇农只是盲目崇拜批准，对其错误不加批评，完全放弃党的领导。这说明许多同志有软弱病，缺乏原则性，不敢坚持真理。过去各区曾经犯过这一类似的错误，如强调放手发动群众，不泼冷水，这无疑的是完全正确的，但当运动发生了左倾杀人错误时，仍抱定决不纠偏的态度，使运动陷入无政府状态，无组织、无计划、无纪律、完全作了落后思想的尾巴，使我们吃了很大的亏（如豫北和晋南某些地区）。须知农民群众的意见是比较朴素、比较简单、比较生动、比较原始、比较片面的，党的任务是既要向群众学习，同时还要提高群众。比如最近发现农民在几个问题上与我们不一致：（甲）为了想多分土地浮财故意提高别人成份；（乙）对地主分同样一份土地不同意；（丙）要斗地主富农的工商业；（丁）要动中农的浮财，不给中农生产贷款，强借中农牲口车辆生产，加重中农负担等。这四个问题，为了农民群众的根本利益，长远利益，我们就不能与之妥协，就必须教育说服农民不要这样做。\n    （五）由于此次填补运动系与整党和民主运动结合进行，我们在这方面还缺乏经验，又由于春耕前土改与整党任务不可能完成（力争完成但不可能），如果普遍发动，势必耽误春耕，且搞不彻底，对以后工作反而有害。我们考虑在春耕前，只采取有重点的推进办法，每个地委区只选择一两个县，集中该地委区的一切力量采取突破一点取得经验，教育群众，教育干部，普及全面，波浪式的发展办法，以便将填补整党与民主都做好。创造经验，待春耕后再全面开展运动。这种办法的好处，是既可以创造经验，少犯错误，又不至耽误春耕。并可以解决因整编队伍而造成的干部缺乏的困难。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九四八年二月一日"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin Cha Ji] 27th Dispatch: The land reform in the old revolutionary base area of Pingshan, Jin察冀 [Jin Cha Ji], has created a paradigm for combining party rectification with mass mobilization. A brief introduction of its experience is provided below for study and reference by various regions.\n\nPingshan County is a region comprised of both semi-old areas liberated for two and a half years and old areas liberated for over ten years. In the old areas, rent and interest reduction were implemented during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the semi-old areas, there was a fierce anti-traitor liquidation campaign after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, both the old and semi-old areas have undergone land reform and review movements. The new rich-middle peasant economy has gained a considerable advantage, and the proportion of poor and hired peasants has relatively decreased. In the old areas, landless and land-poor peasants generally only account for 30 to 40 percent, while those who truly lack land, especially good land and land near their homes, only account for about 20 percent. In the semi-old areas, landless and land-poor peasants only account for about 40 percent. The landlords and rich peasants who occupy more and better land are almost all from the families of party members and cadres, and non-party figures in the Three-thirds System. Although old rich peasants own more land than the landlords who have been struggled against, they own less than the new rich peasants and even the wealthy middle peasants. Many rural party branches have been infiltrated by landlord-rich elements and gangsters, turning party branches into sectarian cliques, committing wrongdoing, and oppressing the masses, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, this land reform is not only a social issue but also a party issue. Before properly addressing this issue and finding concrete solutions, the following deviations occurred: First, the masses spontaneously rose up to struggle against bad party members and cadres. In many areas, some party members and cadres have been arrested and beaten, causing panic among general party members and cadres. Second, the landlords and rich peasants who have been attacked are scheming to take the opportunity to retaliate, inciting the masses to indiscriminately struggle against party members and cadres. Third, the work teams mechanically insist on struggling against landlords first before solving the cadre problem, forcibly separating the resolution of land issues from the democratic movement; or they prevent the masses from struggling against party members and cadres; or they treat a large number of party members and cadres opposed by the masses as \"stones\" to be moved away, causing a situation of detachment from the masses. Fourth, the work teams use their power to emphasize that the masses should struggle again against the landlords they have already struggled against, attempting to create a so-called \"high tide\" and manufacture so-called \"vigorous\" movements, which inevitably leads to \"leftist\" errors.\n\nAfter Pingshan combined land reform with the party rectification and democratic movement, it created valuable experience in mobilizing the masses to equally distribute land in the old liberated areas. The main form of combining land reform with party rectification was initially to make the party branch public, conduct party rectification with the assistance of the broad masses, and combine party meetings with mass meetings. Secondly, a system of people's congresses was established from the township to the county level, and all powers were granted to them. Initially, the branch also closed its doors to investigate class background, work style, and eliminate sectarianism. However, after seven or eight sessions, it proved ineffective. Later, the doors were opened, first to absorb non-party poor peasants, and then to absorb non-party middle peasants. The meetings were attended by twenty or thirty party members and seventy or eighty non-party peasants, changing the secretive nature of rural branch meetings in the past. Finally, the obstacles that bad elements had erected to isolate our party from the masses were broken, allowing the class ideology, work style, and behavior of each party member to be clarified under the scrutiny of the masses, and the masses to propose opinions on how to deal with good and bad party members, which the branch immediately accepted. Those who should be rewarded were immediately rewarded, and those who should be punished were immediately punished. All bad elements could only reform themselves, and all small factions would immediately disintegrate. These meetings sometimes continued for twenty-four hours, and the masses were unwilling to adjourn, demonstrating the intensity of their emotions. The masses believe that as long as the party no longer protects its own members, and the cadres accept the opinions, punishments, and education of the masses, they have no worries and will stand with the party. They said, \"Now we can communicate with Chairman Mao, and it has become a true Chairman Mao party.\" Therefore, making rural parties public and accepting mass opinions to transform and educate party members is not a simple technical issue, but a serious political issue. Due to the past secrecy of rural parties, bad elements were able to sever the connection between the party's leaders and the masses. Today, making the party public in the old liberated areas is an important key to improving our party's relationship with the masses. This democratic movement of party rectification has the following benefits: First, this is a party branch congress, which emphasizes reasoning and investigating facts. The non-party peasants who are invited to participate are respected by the party and have full rights to speak, testify, and offer opinions. Therefore, non-party peasants also doubly respect the leadership of the party. In general mass meetings, the emotions of some peasants who are venting their anger, retaliating, scolding, and randomly beating people will naturally be replaced by the spirit of treating illness and saving people, criticizing, and offering opinions. Moreover, because the party promptly criticizes and punishes the bad party members and cadres they oppose at the meeting, and rewards and promotes the good party members and cadres they support, the masses not only have the opportunity to fully express their grievances against certain party members and cadres, but also can obtain satisfactory solutions. Under the leadership of the party, it is possible to break away from the passive state of general mass meetings and obtain the possibility of actively handling internal party problems in a way that both mobilizes the masses and takes care of party members and cadres. In this way, party members and cadres can also sincerely accept criticism and automatically correct their mistakes, which has a profound educational significance for both party members and cadres and the broad masses. Second, because such a branch congress has the participation of the broad masses and full rights of criticism, it has the pressure of a mass meeting, making it impossible to hide, deceive, or quibble about any mistakes. In addition, with strong leadership that can understand the overall situation, carefully analyze problems, and give the criticized cadres the opportunity to speak and reason, explaining that some of their mistakes are the responsibility of the higher levels, who can then testify for them, it is possible to distinguish responsibilities, so that all problems can be resolved in a realistic and truthful manner, avoiding the masses' simple and one-sided observation of the shortcomings of party members and cadres. Third, using this method of combining internal party mobilization and persuasion with the democratic forces of the masses to get rural party members and cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds to hand over land and property will also be more appropriate than simply handing them over to mass meetings for struggle.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平山老解放区土改经验　创造整党与发动群众相结合的范例\n\n1948-02-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平山老解放区土改经验\n  　创造整党与发动群众相结合的范例\n    【新华社晋察冀二十七日电】晋察冀平山老解放区土改中，创造了整党与发动群众相结合的范例，兹特扼要介绍其经验供各地研究参考。\n    平山县是一个包括解放了两年半的半老区和解放了十年以上的老区的地区。在老区，经过了抗战中的减租减息，在半老区则经过了抗战胜利后激烈的反奸清算；但不论在老区和半老区又都经过了土改和复查运动。新的富中农经济已占相当优势，贫雇农的比例已相对减缩。在老区，无地和少地的农民一般的只占百分之三十到四十，真正缺地，特别缺乏好地和近地的农民，则只占百分之二十左右。在半老区，无地和少地的农民，亦只占百分之四十左右。而占有较多和较好土地的地主富农，则差不多全是党员干部的家庭，和三三制的党外人士。旧富农虽拥有比斗争过的地主较多的土地，但比新富农甚至比富裕中农还少。不少农村党又混进了地富分子和流氓分子，把党的支部变为宗派小集团，为非作歹，欺压群众，造成了广大群众的不满情绪。因而此次土地改革，不仅是一个社会问题，同时也是一个党内问题。在没有适当处理这种问题并找到具体解决问题的办法前，就发生了以下各种偏向：第一，是群众自动起来斗争坏的党员干部。在不少地区，已有一些党员干部被捕、被打，造成一般党员干部中的惊慌。第二，是已受打击的地主富农阴谋乘机报复，煽动群众对党员干部胡乱斗争。第三，是工作团机械的坚持先斗地主再解决干部问题，硬把解决土地问题和民主运动机械分开；或者制止群众对党员干部的斗争；或者将群众反对的大批党员干部当作“石头”搬走，造成脱离群众的情况。第四，是工作团利用权力，强调群众对斗过的地主再来斗争，企图掀起所谓“高潮”，制造所谓“轰轰烈烈”，结果必然要犯“左”的错误。\n    平山把土地改革与整党民主运动结合起来以后，创造了老解放区发动群众平分土地的宝贵经验。土改同整党结合的主要形式，开初就是公开党的支部，在广大群众援助下进行整党，把党的会议与群众大会合而为一。其次，就是从乡到县建立了人民代表大会的系统，并赋予一切权力。开始时，支部也是关门查阶级、查作风及消灭宗派。但是开了七八次，均无效。后来把门打开，首先吸收非党贫农参加，接着吸收非党中农也参加。参加会议党员二三十人，非党农民七八十人，改变了过去农村支部开会时那种神秘性。最后，打破了坏分子隔离我党与群众联系的障碍，使得每个党员的阶级思想作风行为，在群众对证下，受到查清，并由群众提出处理好坏党员的意见，支部当即接受，该奖者立即奖励，该罚者马上处罚，一切坏分子只有改过自新，一切小宗派就会立即瓦解。这种会有时连续进行二十四小时，群众都不愿散会，情绪之热烈，可见一斑。群众认为，只要党不再包庇自己的党员，干部接受群众的意见、处分、教育，就没有任何顾虑的和党站在一起了。他们说：“这下可与毛主席通气了，可成了真毛主席党了。”因此，农村党的公开，并接受群众意见改造、教育党员，不是简单的技术问题，而是严重的政治问题。由于过去农村党的秘密，使得坏分子把党的领导者与群众的联系隔断了，今天在老解放区公开党是改善我们党与群众关系的重要关键。这种整党的民主运动，有以下几种好处：第一、这是党的支部大会，是讲道理查事实的，被邀参加的非党农民，受到党的尊重，有充分讲话、证明、提意见的权利，因此非党农民也就加倍尊重党的领导。在一般群众大会上，某些农民那种出气报复、漫骂乱打的情绪，自然会被治病救人批评提意见的精神所代替。而且由于党在会上及时的批评和处分了他们所反对的坏的党员干部，奖励和提拔了他们所拥护的好的党员干部，使得非党群众对党员干部的某些积怨，不仅有机会充分申诉，而且能得到满意的解决。而在党的领导上，又能摆脱一般群众大会上的被动状态，而获得了既能发动群众又能照顾党员干部的两全其美的主动处理党内问题的可能。这样，党员干部也能诚恳接受批评，自动改正错误，对党员干部以及对广大群众的教育意义都较深刻。第二、这样的支部大会，由于有广大的非党群众参加，与充分的批评权利，因此就具有群众大会的压力，使得任何错误都无法隐瞒欺骗和狡赖。再加上强有力的领导，能够了解全盘情况，细密分析问题，并予被批评的干部以发言说理的机会，说明他们的某些错误是要上级负责，上级当时也可替他作证，这样就可分清责任，使得一切问题都能获得实事求是的解决，避免群众单纯片面的观察党员干部缺点。第三、用这种党内动员说服与群众民主力量相结合的方式，要地主富农出身的农村党员干部交出土地财产来，也会比一般的把他们交给群众大会去斗争的方式要更适当些。"

    "content": "Party Rectification Closely Combined with Democratic Movement\n  　Zhao Village Masses Review Party Members\n    [Our News] The Zhao Village branch in the Ninth District of Wu'an has three characteristics: First, the majority are of poor and hired peasant origin; second, they were developed from the three major movements of Anti-Maintenance, Rent Reduction and Debt Clearance, and Filling the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies (the most new party members were developed in the last one); third, they have consistently combined a few activists to replace the entire masses, thus forming a situation where the Party stood above the masses to fight against landlords and rich peasants. As a result, although the landlords and rich peasants were basically defeated, and Filling the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies was largely done on the surface, it was still a new kind of autocratic rule over the masses.\n    Starting from this situation, the Zhao Village work team decided to take a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, the main force visited the masses to mobilize them (focusing on the poor and hired peasants), and on the other hand, three people were assigned to lead the rectification of the branch. At the beginning, a branch meeting was held to give party members a \"Party Member Admonition,\" explaining the spirit of party rectification according to Chairman Mao's New Year's speech, and then they were divided into groups for self-criticism. A total of thirty-five people participated, divided into two groups. According to the situation revealed in the first round of self-examination:\n    I. Composition: 24 poor and hired peasants, 9 middle peasants, 1 bankrupt landlord, and 1 unknown.\n    II. Types of errors and number of offenders: According to their own self-criticism results, 9 people were overly aggressive in turning themselves over [after liberation], 9 were undemocratic – spoke rudely, 9 mutually took care of each other with power, 5 embezzled public funds for profit, 5 covered up the property of landlords and rich peasant relatives and friends, 7 stole fruit, 3 (relatively serious) frequented prostitutes, 1 was a petty thief, 10 evaded military service, 4 were lazy in labor after becoming cadres, and 1 forced a marriage. (Some people committed several types of errors).\n    III. Several people with major errors: (1) Anti-Conscription Committee Member Jin Linyi: the son of a bankrupt landlord who had squandered his family fortune on eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling in his youth, becoming a hooligan. During Rent Reduction and Debt Clearance, he regained a share of his family property by settling accounts with his elder brother, but during last year's struggle, he openly shielded his elder brother. In life, he still ate and drank extravagantly, owing debts everywhere in the street, with no major difference from before. He did not admit his mistakes at all during this study session and has been suspended from party membership. (2) Anti-Conscription Director Jin Guoquan: According to dozens of opinions collected by party members from the masses, he was said to have embezzled a lot in the distribution of military shoes, and to have shielded landlords and been unfair in assigning tasks. He admitted the latter two items but did not admit to embezzlement, saying he had accounts to prove it. (3) Finance Director Jin Tongyuan: He used to be a bandit and ran a butcher shop. He worked in the village cooperative butcher shop and served as finance director. Some said he was corrupt and fed his own small sheep in the butcher shop, fattening them up to sell. He admitted the latter but denied being corrupt. (4) Farmers' Association Director Jin Suoze: Of poor peasant origin, he had been director for less than half a year, and his work style was extremely undemocratic, dictatorial, and arbitrary, without consulting other Farmers' Association members; he united with people from his own street to cover up corruption cases; especially after the promulgation of the Land Law, he convened a meeting of Farmers' Association cadres to conspire on a strategy for handing over fruit [of the struggle], which was opposed by his cadres. He also frightened other party members, saying: \"We have now become political prisoners, don't believe in self-criticism;\" and intimidated other members of middle peasant origin with his own background. After other comrades raised this, he not only did not accept it but immediately brought up the other shortcomings of the speaker to counter them.\n    IV. Comprehensive branch situation as seen from the first self-criticism: (1) Overly aggressive in turning themselves over and undemocratic were general, even small cadres and small party members were more or less tainted with this style. (2) Major mistakes were made by senior cadres, but they were in the minority. (3) Small party members and small cadres were very active in raising opinions about each other, while senior cadres spoke very little. (4) Young people were less concerned about themselves and others, and their determination to reform was greater. (5) The materials talked about were either well-known or trivial. Truly unknown and more serious mistakes had not been talked about.\n    At this time, the relationship between the Party and the masses: because some senior cadres had major problems, and small cadres and small party members often spoke from the standpoint of cadres, the masses regarded them as a gang, even including general non-party activists. Therefore, the preparatory members who were about to establish the Poor Peasants' Association were unwilling to have a single party member recommended to them. However, these small party members and small cadres also had no status within the Party. Compared with the good poor and hired peasants, they were not necessarily inferior in history and character, and they even surpassed them in political awareness and struggle experience, just because they had been involved with those senior cadres in some things, the masses closed them out, which was also a major loss in work and needed to be reversed. In the process of party rectification, several problems were encountered, and the work team handled them as follows: (1) Cadre Panic: After the promulgation of the Land Law, some cadre party members with excessive problems felt panic. This panic was inevitable. But at this time, these people insisted on dragging some relatively clean or less problematic cadres and party members along with them, so they said some precautionary words to them, or said \"We seem to have all become political prisoners,\" or used the action of selling things to eat and drink heavily to influence them. After investigating these situations, they were convened to read the \"Party Member Admonition\" and the \"Regulations on Punishment for Crimes of Sabotaging the Land Law,\" and it was explained that they would not be treated politely if they committed crimes in the future, and if they had committed crimes in the past and did not confess them, they would be punished in the same way if they were found out in the future. This had some effect and made them more honest. (2) Way Out: Because of the emphasis on stopping criminal behavior, the general party members felt that there was no way out, as if they had also committed crimes by following others. Therefore, at the second meeting, they talked about \"Only honest reform is the way out.\" Although the content was still the \"Party Member Admonition\" and the part of Chairman Mao's New Year's report on party rectification, the focus was different, and it played a different role. The next day, they discussed it again, and the mood stabilized, and then they were divided into groups for self-criticism. (3) In-Depth Problem: In self-criticism, it was found that some people still held the same attitude as when washing their faces and wiping off the black spots, thinking that as long as they passed the test, they could continue to be cadres. Therefore, they avoided discussing basic issues or glossed over them, only looking for some trivial matters (such as taking a teacup from the fruit) to make up the numbers. At this time, the work team talked about the part of the \"Farmer Admonition\" about transforming the regime, telling them: Future regimes at all levels will be produced from the Farmers' Congress, and the village regime is re-elected every year. The Party will re-elect the branch committee and group leaders according to the Party Constitution. If you do not honestly criticize your mistakes to the masses, not to mention becoming a cadre in the future, it is doubtful whether anyone in the Farmers' Association will recommend you to join the association. In the future, the reformed party will not necessarily recognize you as a party member based on the opinions of the masses. Only in this way can their impure motives be dispelled, and they seem to be more conscious and serious afterward. (4) Firepower Problem: People with major problems were not easy to accept other people's opinions, and sometimes even brought up the other party's mistakes to attack them. Although this attitude had been severely criticized, it still could not form mass pressure. The next day, some relatively clean and active people were selected to convene a meeting of party member activists (because activists had not been reviewed by the masses, selection should be very cautious, and they should not be fixedly viewed). Their opinions on those people were solicited. At this meeting, they pointed out the basic mistakes of those people, saying them very systematically, and saying that they had always been afraid of those people, fearing retaliation. The work team encouraged them with the democratic direction in the future, which broke down some of their doubts – that is, telling them that people who made mistakes would no longer have the position to retaliate against others in the future. After this meeting, another review meeting was held with those who had major problems, and more basic opinions were raised. Only then did the use of organizational force to rectify the organization take shape, and those who were not honest felt real pressure. The formation of this pressure was also related to the firm attitude of the leadership. The work team said to those who resisted: Those who want to reflect can reflect, and those who don't want to can choose not to participate, you can decide for yourselves. This also put greater pressure on them.\n    　　　　Village Assembly Announces Party Openly\n    After visiting the poor and hired peasants, preliminary class division, and party rectification, the following three problems were discovered: (1) The masses could not figure out the bottom line of the work team and still had concerns, fearing that this time would be the same as washing their faces and wiping off the black spots. (2) Party rectification was carried out behind closed doors in the branch, without mass pressure, and the problem could not be solved. Some party members and cadres with many problems and major errors did not reflect. (3) The poor and hired peasants who had been contacted requested to be organized. Therefore, a village-wide meeting was specially convened on the evening of February 2nd. Nearly 2,000 people attended, which was said to be the first such meeting in Zhao Village.\n    Before the meeting, the 25 Poor Peasants' Association initiators elected by the poor and hired peasants from each street first held a small meeting, and elected one person to make a public appeal at the end of the meeting to initiate the organization of the Poor Peasants' Association.\n    The meeting began with a comrade from the work team clearly expressing the purpose, task and attitude of this visit to Zhao Village. It was affirmed that this time was real, not like washing their faces and wiping off the black spots. At the same time, the following matters were announced: (1) The current village cadres should still do a good job during the mass review period. They can only help with the implementation of the Land Law and are not allowed to sabotage it. They must not make any threatening or retaliatory remarks or actions against the opinions raised by the masses, whether now or in the future. Anyone who dares to retaliate and threaten boldly will be sabotaging the implementation of the Land Law, and the masses will punish him. (2) The branch will cease its work and await mass review and evaluation. Currently, all party members have only two things to do: First, honestly reflect on themselves and prepare to accept mass review; second, those who are recognized by the masses as still being party members should honestly help the masses in the process of implementing the Land Law Outline, showing whether they stand on the side of the masses and serve the masses; those who are not recognized by the masses as communist party members and are recommended by the Communist Party to be punished should also reflect on themselves, not resent the masses, and retaliate against the masses.\n    Then the list of 39 party members of the branch was announced, along with the decision to suspend Jin Linyi's party membership. In the past, the Zhao Village branch had only made three party members public. This time, all were made public, and the request for mass review was a major shock to the party members and a great excitement and encouragement to the masses.\n    In order to make everyone dare to review cadres and party members and dare to express opinions, it was announced: 1. Everyone should boldly raise opinions to village cadres and party members to help them reflect and transform themselves, but only to reason, not to fight. They must follow the rules and maintain order, and must not treat cadres and party members in the same way as they treated landlords in the past. If there are bad cadres with major crimes, they will be sent to the people's court for handling after being reported by everyone, and Zhao Village can also organize a people's court. 2. The ten disciplines stipulated in the \"Party Member Admonition\" were read again, calling on party members and cadres to humbly accept the review of the Poor Peasants' Association and the masses.\n    Before the meeting, when the branch party member cadres first came to the stage, the masses thought: \"They have gone to the stage again, I think it is still the same as washing their faces and wiping off the black spots, it's useless.\" The cadres and party members stood loosely, and the masses did not dare to get close to them and did not dare to look at them. After the meeting, the poor peasants generally reflected, \"This is not afraid anymore,\" \"Cadre retaliation will not work.\" After this meeting, the atmosphere in the whole village became tense.\n    　　　　Rectifying the Party Among the Masses\n    After thirteen days (from the evening of January 22nd to February 4th) of experience, it was proven that party rectification behind closed doors would not work. Party members must feel the pressure of the masses, and know that the masses have many and serious opinions about bad party members (many events are small things in the eyes of party member cadres, but the masses who have personally experienced them complain very indignantly), and they must reflect well in order to obtain the people's forgiveness. At the same time, before the establishment of the Poor Peasants' Association, party members of poor peasant origin must return to their own mass ranks, examine their composition, and obtain permission to join the Poor Peasants' Association before they can participate in the work of Zhao Village. The work team carefully studied this repeatedly on the evening of the 3rd and cautiously proposed a policy, namely: on the one hand, to encourage the masses to dare to give opinions to party members and cadres to educate the cadres; on the other hand, to prevent the growth of sectarian anti-party emotions and unexpected incidents of beating party members and cadres without pouring cold water. The specific steps taken were: on the 4th, work comrades went to the masses to solicit opinions, and that evening, most of the middle peasant forums were held in each street and alley, and the middle peasants' opinions on party members and cadres were preliminarily collected. On the evening of the 5th, peasant meetings were held in all five streets, with the participation of poor and middle peasants. The explanation was given in advance by the work team comrades and Poor Peasants' Association members. In the street meetings, the poor and middle peasants spoke generally enthusiastically, but some of them contained sectarian retaliatory emotions. At the end of the meeting, the work comrades sincerely invited everyone to send representatives to the branch to give opinions, and each street elected about 20 representatives, preparing to participate in the branch meeting. The conditions for selecting these people were: they spoke more, suffered more grievances, knew more things, and could represent everyone's views.\n    The branch meeting was held on the morning of the 6th, and the venue was arranged by the party members themselves. The Party flag and Chairman Mao's portrait were hung in the middle, which was especially solemn and solemn. The peasant representatives from each street first gathered together, gathered their opinions, and then mobilized them before entering the venue. First, the work team made a mobilization and read the list of party members one by one to solicit opinions. The first ones raised were generally those with smaller errors. A few opinions were raised by the masses, and they could be passed. Some simply had no one raise an opinion. The opinions were concentrated on Jin Caiyuan, Yang Zhankui (village chief), Jin Suozi (Farmers' Association director), Li Wenke (public security officer), Xue Shuangsuo (political director), Jin Tongyuan (finance director) and others. After some opinions were raised, they were all temporarily put aside, and the masses were informed that they would be specially mentioned when they found time to deal with it. For example, Jin Guoquan, according to the masses, could not be finished in a day, so it was simply put aside. People with moderate errors were passed after a few opinions were raised, and some even proposed correction conditions. Party members did not make any defense on the spot, and only listened to the opinions of the masses.\n    There were three types of people who were more active in the meeting: 1. Individual veterans. Because they had the ability to speak and had accumulated hatred for the village cadres, they spoke a lot, and had sectarian retaliatory and blindly anti-party emotions. A young veteran easily said that someone \"did not have the qualifications to be a party member\" because of personal grudges and small matters. 2. Middle peasants also spoke more generally, but they mostly started from the oppression they had suffered personally, and some things were very small. 3. A few small faction activists. Zhao xx had a small organization of four or five people, and they also spoke more. When he gave opinions on Jin Heliang, the masses pointed out that it was out of suspicion and retaliation. However, according to a post-meeting investigation, there were many honest people who rarely spoke in the past who opened their mouths today. The masses were very determined to speak. For example, Jin Weilin of the Third Street said: \"If I don't talk, I will suffocate, if I talk, I will be scared to death, I will talk even if I die.\" However, the poor peasants did not speak very enthusiastically, which was a shortcoming.\n    The comrades of the work team made a final speech, expressing their gratitude to the masses for helping the party rectification, and pointed out the following points: 1. Such a public branch meeting with the participation of the masses was unprecedented, proving that our party accepts the opinions of the masses. 2. Party members' oppression of the people, overly aggressive turning over, unclear accounts, fear of death and unwillingness to join the army, opposition to land reform, shielding landlords, mutual protection, domination, and messing around with women... are all extremely wrong. In the future, those who the people say are bad should be expelled, transferred, or punished, and it is absolutely not allowed for good and bad people to be in the same gang. 3. The people of Zhao Village still believe in the Communist Party. In the future, party members will be made public and reviewed by the people of each street and alley, and will be approved before entering the Farmers' Association. The people will definitely take back what they are afraid of. Those who are bad and do not change will be expelled and handed over to the people for handling, and we will never interfere with the freedom of the people to allow or deny party members to join the Poor Peasants' Association and the Farmers' Association. Finally, he firmly ordered the party members to never retaliate against the people. He also pointed out that all kinds of factions in the village must be broken. Among them, he especially told the retired soldiers that they had received the education of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, and knew more principles, and should help the party rectification well, which was actually criticizing their sectarian retaliation.\n    The opinions raised by the masses at the peasant meetings and branch meetings in each street were roughly as follows: 1. Small factions, a swarm of bees, undemocratic, oppressing the people, hanging up poor and hired peasants, arrogant attitude, not seeing the people. 2. Seizing and stealing the fruits of struggle, most cadres and activists seized good houses and good land, unfair evaluation, and excessively aggressive turning over. 3. Fear of death and unwillingness to join the army, and there were many who dared not go to the front line after deserting. 4. Corruption, extortion, fines, apportionments, and unclear accounts were even more common. The masses demanded liquidation of the accounts of the Farmers' Association, the cooperative, and the fruits of previous years. 5. Forced marriage, messing around with prostitutes. 6. Not active, not speaking up. Although they were good people, they could not do things for the people and followed the bad cadres. Some were \"cannons\" (talking nonsense) or thugs.\n    There were about two types of people with few opinions: One type said he was good, such as Zhao Fushan (deputy village chief) who \"followed the people.\" The other type did not assume major responsibilities and did not do major things, and did whatever people asked them to do, and did not offend the people severely.\n    In short, the number and seriousness of the opinions raised by the masses far exceeded those exposed by the closed-door party rectification. The advantage of the masses sending representatives to participate in the branch meeting this time was that the masses were able to vent their anger, giving the bad cadres further pressure, making them know that it was not the superiors who wanted to rectify him, but the masses would not allow it. At the same time, the masses also saw our sincerity in reforming the party, but on the other hand, we should also be wary of the blindly anti-party emotions and the atmosphere of venting personal grievances, and carefully guide the masses to help the party rectification.\n    　　　　Poor and Hired Peasant Representatives Review the First Batch of Party Members\n    In order to carefully reverse the anti-party atmosphere, truly reflect the opinions of the poor and hired peasants, properly handle each party member separately, and effectively dismantle the small faction of the old branch, the Poor Peasants' Association members meetings were convened in two units on the evening of February 7. Fifteen party members who had reflected better in the branch, made smaller mistakes, and had better relations with the masses were sent to the two units separately to reflect, accept the criticism and review of the Poor Peasants' Association. The review items were the individual's family composition, mistakes, whether he was qualified to be a party member, whether he could participate in the Poor Peasants' Association or the Farmers' Association, etc.\n    The meeting was chaired by the chairman elected by the Poor Peasants' Association members themselves. The comrades of the work team made some mobilization, mainly explaining: Raise as many opinions as you have on these party members, and you can say directly whether they are qualified to be party members. At the same time, it was explained that these party members had reflected relatively well in the branch. If everyone thought they could be reformed, they should be rescued with an attitude of treating illnesses and saving people. What they should withdraw, what they should change, should all be raised, and it was guaranteed that it would be done.\n    The mistakes made by these fifteen people, from their own reflections, were roughly bad speaking attitude, bad labor, whoring, excessive turn-over, small acts of corruption and stealing fruit, and individual lack of firmness in the struggle against landlords. Some of them committed only one type, such as a bad attitude, while others committed more than two types, but all of them were relatively small. For these smaller mistakes, no one at this meeting generally adopted a hostile attitude or deliberately added fuel to the fire, causing resentment. This shows that the poor peasants have strong principles. For example, after Zhao Fushan (deputy village chief) reflected, someone proposed: \"You must change your attitude, your speech is too rushed (crude)!\" Another person continued: \"I used to suffer with him for several years, and his speech was just rushed, and he was like that even when he was not a cadre.\" The masses said: \"This can't be considered a big problem. Everything else is good, he can be a party member.\" Xue Sanzi (poor peasant, youth) glared his eyes when he spoke, offending many of the masses. But because the reflection was more thorough, the attitude of the masses was also: \"Young people can change!\" In general, the masses were disgusted by the phenomenon of glaring eyes when speaking, but as long as it was changed, it was not unforgivable. For example, when discussing Meng Nanfang (civil affairs director), everyone agreed that he could be a party member.\n    But from another aspect, the masses were not just doing things sloppily, but were very serious. When Zhao Taonian reflected, he forgot to review his extra fruit and higher turn-over due to panic, and the masses immediately questioned him. He was only let go after seeing that he did not deliberately conceal it. Zhang Shulin was an accountant in the cooperative, and the masses knew that he was not in charge and would not have committed major corruption. He confessed to the small corruption, and the masses immediately asked from the aspect of \"Did you know the ills of the senior cadres?\" He was only let go after he replied responsibly that there was absolutely no such thing on his counter, but with the added condition: \"If such a thing is found out in the future, you will be shielding him!\" When Zhao Chunshan (deputy director of the military committee) reflected that he did not know anything about the past cadre problems, the masses expressed trust in this, but raised it from another aspect: \"It is also wrong for you to be irresponsible for anything (not to care)!\" This shows that they have a simple understanding and considerable concern for the issue of party members' political sense of responsibility, which is completely different from the mood of making sectarian issues. As a result of the review, all fifteen party members passed. After the meeting, the party members who had passed the review of the Poor Peasants' Association were happy, while those who did not pass felt depressed, \"could not figure out the bottom line,\" and were eager to ask the party for instructions on the way out.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 整党与民主运动密切结合　赵庄群众审查党员\n\n1948-02-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　整党与民主运动密切结合\n  　赵庄群众审查党员\n    【本报消息】武安九区赵庄支部有三个特点：第一是贫雇出身者占大多数，第二是从反维持、减租清债和填平补齐三次大运动中发展起来的（在最后一次发展的新党员最多），第三是一贯的结合少数积极分子代替全体群众，便形成党站在群众之上与地主富农作战，结果虽然基本上打垮了地主富农，大体在表面上做过填平补齐，可是对群众仍是一种新的独断统治。\n    从这种情况出发，赵庄工作组决定双管齐下，一方面用主力访问群众发动群众（侧重在贫雇），同时却分出三个人来领导支部整顿。开始即召开支部会，讲告党员书，根据毛主席元旦讲话解释了整党精神，然后分组作自我检讨。参加者共三十五人，分为两组。根据第一遍反省所透露的情况是：\n    一、成份：贫雇二十四人，中农九人，破产地主一人，尚有一人未详。\n    二、错误类型及犯者人数：据他们自己反省结果，翻身过高者九人、不民主——说话气粗者九人、互相以权力关照者九人、借用公款营利者五人、掩护地富亲友财物者五人、偷取果实者七人、逛破鞋者（较严重的）三人、小偷一人、逃避参军参战者十人、当干部后劳动不力者四人、强迫婚姻者一人。（有一人兼数种者）\n    三、几个错误重大的人；（１）抗勤委员靳林议：是个破产经营地主之子，幼年吃喝嫖赌荡尽家产变作流氓，减租清债时与他哥哥算帐又得回一分家产，但在去年斗争时又公然包庇他哥哥，在生活上仍然大吃大喝，在街上到处欠债，和从前无大区别，这次学习一点也不认错，已停止其党籍。（２）抗勤主任靳国全：据党员们搜集群众对他的意见数十条，说他于派做军鞋中贪污甚多，且包庇地主、派差不公，他除承认后两项外，对贪污不承认，说他有帐可稽。（３）财政主任靳同元：从前当过土匪，会开肉坊，在本村合作社肉坊工作、并任财政主任，有人说他有贪污，又在肉坊喂小份羊（自己的）喂成就卖，除他承认后者外，否认有贪污。（４）农会主任靳锁则：贫农出身，当主任不及半年，作风极不民主，遇事专横独断，不与其他农会委员商量；团结本街人包庇贪污案；特别是土地法公布以后，召开农会干部会，准备共谋交代果实时之对策，为他干部所反对。又吓唬其他党员说：“咱们现在成了政治犯，可不要相信反省的话；”又以自己之出身吓唬其他中农出身者。经其他同志提出后、他不但不接受，且马上提出发言人之其他缺点以作对抗。\n    四、综合第一次反省所可看出的支部情况：（１）翻身过高与不民主带有一般性，即便是小干部小党员，也或多或少沾有此风。（２）大错误都出在大干部身上，但在人数上是少数。（３）小党员小干部互相提意见很积极，而大干部发言甚少。（４）青年人对己对人顾忌都少，改过决心也大。（５）所谈出来的材料，或为人所共知者，或为鸡毛蒜皮者，真正人所未知而较严重的错误还没有谈出来。\n    在这时，党与群众之关系：因为有些大干部毛病大，小干部小党员也常站在干部立场上讲话，因而群众把他们看成一伙，甚而连一般非党员积极分子都看在内。因之，在即将准备成立贫农团的预备团员们，连一个党员也不愿介绍进去。但这些小党员小干部，在党内也是没有地位，和好的贫雇比历史、比人品，也不见得不如，在政治认识和斗争经验上还超过他们，就只因为跟着那些大干部共过些事，群众就把他们关在门外，也是工作上的大损失，须要设法扭转这种关系。而在整党工作过程中也遇到了几个问题，工作组是这样处理的：（一）干部恐慌问题：土地法公布后，有些毛病过大的干部党员感到恐慌。这种恐慌是必然的。可是这种人在这时候，偏要拖一些比较清白的或毛病较小的干部、党员跟着他跑，于是就和他们说一些要防范的话，或是说“我们好象都成了政治犯”，或是用变卖东西大吃大喝之行动来影响他们。调查到这些情况，就召集他们读告党员书和破坏土地法治罪条例，并说明以后犯了罪绝不客气，以前犯了罪如不坦白说出，今后查出来同样也要治罪。这一下起了一些作用，使他们老实了一些。（２）出路问题：因为强调制止犯罪行为，使一般党员感到无出路，好象自己跟着人家也犯了罪，因此第二次开会时，谈了一谈“只有老实改过才是出路”，内容虽仍是告党员书及毛主席元旦报告中关于整党部分，但着重点不同，便起到不同的作用。第二天又讨论了一次，情绪就稳定下来，然后就分组作自我检讨。（３）深入问题：在自我检讨中，发现有些人抱的态度仍和洗脸擦黑时候一样，以为只要一过了关，便可照常当干部，因此避开基本问题不谈，或轻描淡写，只找一些鸡毛蒜皮小事（如在果实中取了一个茶杯之类）来凑数。此时工作组谈了告农民书中的改造政权部分、告他们说：将来的各级政权都要从农代会产生，而且村政权是每年一改选，党要照党章改选支委与小组长，如果不向群众老实检讨自己的错误，不说将来当干部，农会是否有人介绍你入会还成问题，将来改造过的党根据群众的意见，还说不定能不能承认你算个党员，这样才解除了他们心理上一个动机不纯的幻想，以后好象更自觉认真一点。（４）火力问题：毛病较大的人不易接受别人的意见，有时竟提出对方错误来打击对方。对这种态度虽曾给以严厉批评，可是仍不能形成群众压力，第二天便选了些比较清白积极的人召开了个党员积极分子会议（因为积极分子未经群众审查，选择时要十分慎重，同时也不可固定的看他们），征求他们对那几个人的意见。他们在这个会上，把那几个人的基本错误指出来，说得非常有体系，并且说他们自己对那些人一向也有所畏惧，恐怕人家报复。工作组便以今后民主方向鼓励他们，才又打破了他们一些疑虑——即告他们说犯错误的人今后没有报复人的地位了。开过这个会以后，又与那些毛病大的人开检讨会，较基本的意见就更多起来。这才形成了用组织力量来整顿组织，那些不老实的人才感到真正的压力。这种压力的形成，还和领导上的坚决态度有关。工作组对抵抗的人说：愿反省可以反省，不愿意的也可以不参加，你们自己看着办。这使他们也感到较大压力。\n    　　　　村民大会宣布党公开\n    经过访问贫雇、初步划阶级、整党，发现了以下三个问题：（一）群众摸不清工作组的底，仍有顾虑，怕这次又与洗脸擦黑一样。（二）支部中关门整党，没有群众压力，不能解决问题，有些问题多、错误大的党员干部不反省。（三）已串连的贫雇要求组织起来。因此，在二月二日晚间专门召集了一次全村大会。到会的近二千人，据说是赵庄从来没有的一次大会。\n    会前，各街贫雇农推选的二十五个贫农团发起人先开了个小会，推举一人在大会的末尾做一公开号召，发起组织贫农团。\n    大会开始，首先由工作组同志把这次来赵庄的目的、任务与态度明确的作了表示。肯定的说：这一次是真的，不是象洗脸擦黑一样。同时宣布了以下几件事：（一）现任的村干部在群众审查期间仍应好好办事，对执行土地法只能帮助不准破坏，对群众所提意见，无论现在和将来，不得有任何威胁报复的言论和行动，谁要敢大胆报复和威胁，就是破坏执行土地法，群众就要治他的罪。（二）支部停止工作，听候群众审查评定。目前所有的党员，只有两件事可做：第一好好反省自己，准备接受群众的审查；第二、群众承认你还算个党员的，在执行土地法大纲过程中，要老老实实帮助群众，表明自己是否站在群众方面，为群众服务；群众不承认你是共产党员，建议共产党加以处分的，也应该反省自己，不能怨恨群众，向群众报复。\n    接着就宣布了支部三十九个党员的名单，与停止靳林义党籍的决定。赵庄支部过去只公开过三个党员，这次全部公开，并请求群众审查对于党员是个很大震动，对群众又是个很大的兴奋鼓舞。\n    为了使大家敢于审查干部、党员，敢于提意见，宣布：一、大家要大胆向村干部、向党员提意见，帮助他们反省，改造他们自己，但只限于说理，不准打架，必须按规矩办事，守秩序，不能象过去对待地主一样的对待干部与党员。如果有坏干部，罪过大，经大家检举后送交人民法庭去处理，赵庄也可以组织人民法庭。二、重新宣读了一遍告党员书中规定的十条纪律，号召党员、干部虚心接受贫农团与群众的审查。\n    会前，支部党员干部初到台阶上来时，群众想：“人家又到台上去了，我看还和洗脸擦黑一样，不顶事”。干部党员站的地方很松动，群众不敢挨近他们，不敢看他们。会后，贫农普遍反映，“这就不怕了”，“干部报复不成了”。经过这次大会，全村空气为之紧张起来。\n    　　　　在群众中整党\n    经过十三天（一月二十二日晚到二月四日）的经验，证明关门整党是不行的，必须叫党员们感到群众的压力，知道群众对坏党员的意见是很多很严重的（许多事件在党员干部看来是小事，但在亲身感受的群众，则诉起苦来非常愤慨），必须好好反省，才能取得人民的宽恕。同时，在贫农团成立之前，贫农成份的党员要回到本群众队伍里去，审定成份，取得入贫农团的许可，然后才能参与赵庄村的工作。工作组三日晚对此经过反复研究，慎重提出方针，即：一方面要鼓动群众敢于给党员、干部提意见，以教育干部；一方面又要在不泼冷水的情况下，防止宗派性的反党情绪的滋长，及殴打党员干部的意外事件。具体进行的步骤是：四日，工作同志分头向群众征问意见，当晚各街各闾大都开了中农的座谈会，初步搜集了中农对党员、干部的意见。五日晚五个街都举行全街的农民大会，贫、中农都参加。事前由工作组同志及贫农团员进行解释。各街大会中，贫、中农发言均普遍热烈，但其中一部分人含有宗派报复情绪。会终，工作同志诚恳邀请大家派代表到支部去提意见，各街都选出了约二十个代表，准备参加支部大会。这些人选取的条件是：发言较多，受屈较大，了解事情较多，能代表大家发言等。\n    六日上午举行支部大会，会场由党员亲自动手布置。中间挂了党旗和毛主席像，特别显得庄严肃穆。各街农民代表，先集合好，兜拢了意见，并又动员一番，才进入会场。先由工作组做了动员，宣读党员名单，一一征求意见。首先提的，大致都是错误较小的。群众提出几条，就可通过，有的简直没人提意见。意见集中在靳才垣、杨占魁（村长）、靳锁子（农会主任）、李文科（公安员）、薛双锁（政治主任）、靳同元（财政主任）等人身上。提了一些意见后，便都暂时搁过，给群众说明以后找整的时间专门提他们。如靳国全，据群众反映，一天也提不完，就根本搁过未提。中等错误的人，则提过几条之后，大家就喊通过，有的并提出改正条件。党员当场未作任何分辩，专听群众意见。\n    会场发言的有三种人较为活跃：一、个别荣誉军人。因有说话能力，并对村干有积恨，所以发言很多，且有宗派报复及盲目的反党情绪。一个年青的退伍军人，则因私仇和小事，就轻易说人家“没有党员资格”。二、中农发言也较普遍，但他们多从个人所受压迫说起，有的事情很小。三、少数小派别活动者。赵××有个四五个人的小组织，他们也说话较多，他对靳河亮提意见，有群众指出是挟嫌报复。但据会后调查，平常绝少说话的老实人，今天开口了的也不少。群众发言决心是很大的，如三街靳维林说：“不谈要蹩死，谈了要吓死，就死我也要谈。”但贫农发言不很踊跃，是个缺点。\n    工作组同志最后发言，对群众帮助整党，表示感谢，并指出如下几点：一、这样公开要群众参加的支部会，为前所未有，证明我党是接受群众意见的。二、党员有了压迫人民、翻身过高、帐目不清、怕死不肯参军、反对土改、包庇地主、互相包庇、霸占及乱搞女人……等，都是极不对的。以后凡老百姓说不好，就该开除的开除、该调动的调动、该处分的处分，决不允许好的坏的一伙子。三、赵庄老百姓还相信共产党，今后党员公开，交各街各闾老百姓审查，批准后进农会，老百姓害怕的一定收回。坏而不改的，开除交人民处理，我们决不干涉老百姓允许或否决党员入贫农团及农会的自由。最后并坚决命令党员，永远不许向老百姓报复。对村中各种宗派，亦指出必须打破。其中特别对荣退军人，说他们是受过共产党八路军教育的，懂的道理更多，要好好帮助整党，实际是批评了他们的宗派报复。\n    各街农民大会及支部大会上群众所提意见，大概有如下几种：一、小宗派，一窝蜂，不民主，欺压人民，吊打贫雇，态度横暴，看不见老百姓。二、多占及偷窃斗争果实，大多数干部积极分子强占好房好地，评议不公，翻身过高。三、怕死不肯参军，开小差后不敢上前线者为数甚多。四、贪污、勒索、罚款、摊派、帐目不清，更是普遍现象。对农会、合作社及历年果实帐目，群众要求清算。五、强迫婚姻，胡搞破鞋。六、不积极，不吭气。虽为好人，而不能给人民办事，跟着坏干部跑。有些则是“炮”（乱说话）或打手。\n    对意见少的人约有二类：一种是说他好，如赵福山（副村长）是“跟着老百姓跑的”。再一种是未负重大责任，未办大事，人家叫干啥就干啥，对老百姓得罪得不厉害。\n    总之群众所提意见之多及其严重性，远超过关门整党所暴露者，这次群众派代表参加支部大会的好处，是让群众出够了气，给坏干部以进一步压力，使他们知道并不是上级要整他，而是群众不让，同时，群众也看出了我们改造党的诚意，但另一面也很应该警惕盲目的反党情绪与泄私愤的空气，慎重诱导群众帮助整党。\n    　　　　贫雇代表审查第一批党员\n    为着慎重的扭转反党空气，真正反映贫雇农意见，分别的正确处理各个党员，并有效的拆散旧支部这个小宗派，于二月七日晚间分两个单位召集贫农团员会议，把在支部中反省较好、错误较小、与群众关系也较好的十五个党员，分别送到两个单位进行反省，接受贫农团的批评与审查。审查的项目是各人的家庭成份、错误、够不够党员、能不能参加贫农团或农会等。\n    这会议由贫农团团员自己选主席主持，工作组同志进行了一些动员，主要说明：对这几个党员有什么意见尽量提，够不够党员完全可以以直说。同时说明这些党员在支部反省还比较好，如果大家认为他们可以改造，就以治病救人态度来挽救他们，他们该退什么，该改什么，都提出来，保证做到。\n    这十五个人犯的错误，从他们自己的反省看，大体是说话态度不好，劳动不好，嫖女人，翻身较高，小的贪污与偷窃果实行为，个别的对地主斗争不坚决等。其中有的人只犯了一种，如态度坏，有的犯到两种以上，但都犯的较小。对于这些较小的错误，这个会议上一般没有人采取敌对的态度，或故意加油添醋，激起反感的现象，这说明贫农的原则性强。比如，赵福山（副村长）反省后，有人提出：“你的态度可得改一改哩，说话就冲（碰）！”另一个人接着说：“我以前和他在一块给人家受过好几年，他说话就是好冲，不当干部也是那样子。”群众说：“这不能算大病。别的都好，可以当个党员。”薛三子（贫农、青年）一说话就瞪眼，得罪群众很多。但因反省较彻底，群众的态度也是：“年青年人，改过就行！”一般看，群众对这种说话蹬眼的现象是有反感的，但只要改，还不是不能原谅。比如，讨论孟南方（民事主任）时，大家同意他做党员。\n    但从另方面看，群众也不是马马虎虎完事的态度，而是很认真的。赵桃年反省时由于慌张，忘记检讨自己多得果实、翻身高的事情，群众就马上提出质问。以后看到他并不是有意掩饰，才放过去。张树林在合作社当会计，群众知道他不大当家，不致有大贪污，小的贪污自己说了，群众即从“你知不知道大干部的弊病”方面提出，他负责答复了在他这个柜上绝没这种情事以后，才放过去，但有附加条件：“以后如果查出这种事情，你就是包庇！”赵春山（武委会副主任）反省他对过去干部问题什么也不知道时，群众对这点表示信任，但却从另方面提出：“你这对任啥事不负责任（不管）也不对呀！”这表现他们对党员的政治责任心问题有着朴素的理解与相当的关心，这和闹宗派的情绪是完全不同的。审查结果，十五个党员都通过了。会后，已经过贫农团审查够格的党员表现高兴，未通过的则感到苦闷，“摸不着底”，而急于向党请求指示出路。"
