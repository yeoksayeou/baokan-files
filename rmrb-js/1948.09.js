Calculated at 50 thorny branches per load of smoked manure and 30 jin of green artemisia per load of composted manure, 9,785 loads of fertilizer can be produced. Applying 50 loads per mu, it can fertilize 195.5 mu. Everyone said: \"This is at least four times more than in previous years.\" According to normal calculations, applying 50 loads of manure per mu in this village can increase grain production by three dou; next year, wheat production can increase by more than 40 shi, enough for the village's summer rations for a year.

The strike was triggered by the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau's Puzhen Machine Factory's three thousand-plus technicians demanding improved treatment, which the bureau ignored. Consequently, the bureau's Puzhen Machine Factory, Pukou Station, Power Plant, Water Plant, Machine Factory, Ferry, Locomotive Depot, and other ten-plus units declared a strike at approximately 9:00 AM on the 2nd, and dispatched over twenty representatives to negotiate with the bureau, putting forward four demands: (1) Allow each person a temporary advance of 10 million yuan for July; (2) Immediately issue the one stone and four dou of rice owed from May and June; (3) Retroactively pay the 140,000-fold amount of wages owed from June, plus an additional 30%, totaling 182,000-fold, to be issued according to the index; (4) In addition, issue a monthly rice subsidy of seven dou, and ensure no future arrears. When the strike began, all trains on the line were suspended, and the ferry between Xiaguan and Pukou was also halted. Transportation was interrupted, even the Chiang bandit army's transportation command headquarters could not cross the river. All telephones, water, and electricity were also interrupted.

    "content": "Column: Inquiry and Reply\n\n　　Editor Comrade:\n　　Currently, a rumor is spreading in the countryside that there will be a \"second major leveling in September.\" Under this rumor, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has begun to waver, and eating, drinking, and gambling are gradually developing again. I went to Nan Quyu (under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District of Xingtang) to visit relatives, and the masses there were also saying the same thing: another leveling is coming soon. Some also said: The first major leveling targeted landlords and rich peasants; this time (the second time) it might target middle peasants. Some middle peasants are very uneasy, and the trend of eating, drinking, and wasting is rising again. Just at a small market in that village on the tenth, three or four meat sellers and several steamed bun sellers sold out before noon. Middle peasant Li Sanni (who used to work very hard) also rushed to the market to sell her mule, fearing that this leveling would level her mule as well.\n　　I believe that if the rumors continue to spread, it will greatly damage the future work of the masses in working diligently and assiduously to actively produce and lay the foundation for next year's production. Therefore, I hope that the editor comrade will quickly reply to reassure the people and facilitate the masses' active production.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xingtang Nanfuliu Village　Ruilin\n　　Answer: The fourth item of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instruction on \"Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948\" clearly points out: \"In areas where the feudal system has been fundamentally eliminated, and poor and landless peasants have obtained land roughly equivalent to the average amount, and the difference between their land and that of middle peasants is small (which is permissible), it should be considered that the land issue has been resolved, and the issue of land reform should no longer be raised. The central task in these areas is to restore and develop production, complete the work of party consolidation and construction, and support the front lines.\" In most of the areas within the North China Liberated Area, the feudal and semi-feudal systems have been completely eliminated, and landless and land-poor peasants have received their due share of land. In these areas, the basic direction of rural work should shift from land reform to uniting people of all strata to fully restore and develop production. Since Xingtang has already undergone leveling and the number of land occupied by all strata is roughly average, it should be considered that the land issue has been resolved according to the central instructions. The main task in the future should be to unite people of all strata and make great efforts to restore and develop agricultural production, striving to improve agricultural production from its current level so as to better support the war and improve people's lives. Now is the time to seize the opportunity to accumulate fertilizer and compost manure to prepare for planting wheat and lay the foundation for next year's major production. The government should quickly determine land ownership, issue land certificates, formulate new agricultural tax regulations and burden standards, and help farmers solve production difficulties. The counties in the North Yue District have already done or will do so. Even if a few villages still have some land to be distributed or adjusted, or the class composition needs to be revised, it is not to carry out another leveling. The saying that there will be a leveling after autumn is baseless. The so-called second leveling to target middle peasants is even more unfounded. Our Party's policy of solidly uniting the middle peasants has been repeatedly stated in numerous instructions and has been resolutely implemented in actual work. All past deviations that infringed upon the interests of middle peasants must be corrected, and many have already been corrected. We should go deep among the masses to explain and publicize our Party's land reform and production policies, as well as the central tasks of the North China Liberated Area, and formally announce to the masses that land reform has been completed and that land will generally not be changed in the future. All strata should dispel concerns and concentrate on production. Pay attention to and analyze the nature and source of various rumors at any time and refute them. The leading organs should carefully check whether the deviations in land reform have been corrected and whether there are still infringements on the interests of middle peasants. Because concrete facts are the most convincing and the most sufficient to stabilize the people's emotions and clear obstacles to production. The situation reflected in the letter is extremely important, and we hope to continue to provide various concrete materials in the future in order to improve and promote work in various places.　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 土地问题已解决地区决不再进行土改\n\n1948-09-01\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　土地问题已解决地区决不再进行土改编者同志：\n    目前乡间正流传着一种“九月份再来第二次大平分”的说法。在这种流言下，农民生产情绪开始动荡，吃喝赌博又渐发展。我到南瞿营（行唐五区管）看亲去，那里群众也是这样说：又快搞平分呀。还有的说：第一次大平分搞完了地主富农，这次（第二次）可能搞中农。吓的一些中农很不安，吃喝浪费风气又起，只在初十该村一个小集上，三、四个卖肉的、几个卖馍馍的不等上午就卖光了。中农李三妮（过去干活很强）也赶紧上集去卖骡子，怕这次平分再平分了他的骡子。\n    我看谣言流传下去，对今后群众勤劳刻苦，积极生产，为明年生产打基础的工作将受到很大损失。故望编辑同志迅速答复，以安民心，以利群众积极生产。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　行唐南伏流村　瑞林\n    答：中共中央关于“一九四八年土地改革和整党工作”指示中第四项明确指出：“凡属封建制度已经根本消灭，贫雇农已经得到大体上相当于平均数的土地，他们与中农所有土地虽有差别（这种差别是许可的），但是相差不多者，即应认为土地问题已经解决，不要再提土地改革问题。在这类地区的中心任务，是恢复和发展生产，完成整党建设工作及支援前线的工作。”华北解放区内部大部地区，封建与半封建制度已经彻底消灭，无地少地农民已分得应有的一份土地，在这些地区，农村工作的基本方向，应该从土地改革转到团结各阶层人民全力恢复和发展生产方面去。行唐既然已经经过平分，各阶层占有土地数目已大体平均，即应根据中央指示，认为土地问题已经解决，今后主要任务应是团结各阶层人民，以极大努力恢复与发展农业生产，争取农业生产能从现有的水平上提高一寸，以便更好地支援战争改善人民生活。目前正应抓紧时间，积肥沤粪，准备种麦，为明年的大生产打下基础。政府方面应赶快确定地权，颁发土地证，制定新的农业税则和负担标准，并帮助农民解决生产困难。北岳区各县已经或即将这样作。即有少数乡村有些土地尚待分配或调剂，阶级成份尚待改订，但也不是再来一次平分。秋后平分的说法，是毫无根据的。所谓第二次平分要搞中农，更是无中生有。我党巩固地团结中农的政策在屡次指示文件中已再三申明，在实际工作中也已坚决执行。过去所有侵犯中农利益的偏向，必须纠正，而且已纠正了不少。我们应该深入群众解释宣传我党土改和生产政策及目前华北解放区的中心任务，正式向群众宣布土改已经完成，今后土地一般不再变动，各阶层应打消顾虑，安心生产。随时注意并分析各种谣言的性质来源，予以批驳。领导机关要认真检查一下，看看土改中的偏向是否已经纠正，是否仍有侵犯中农的事情。因为具体事实是最有说服力，最足以安定群众情绪，扫清生产障碍的。来信所反映情况极为重要，以后望能不断供给各种具体材料，以便改进并推动各地工作。　——编者"

    "content": "[Taihang Dispatch] The Yan bandit gang in Taiyuan, an isolated island surrounded by our People's Liberation Army, is in a state of panic, and soldiers are deserting in droves. Since August, groups of three to five Yan soldiers have been defecting to our army positions every day. According to Li Renyi, a soldier from the 6th Company of the Yan bandit's 44th Division's Replenishment Regiment who defected, more than half of the 40-plus men in the company had already run away, and those who remained were afraid of being killed and would run out of the camp at night. Speaking of the situation in Taiyuan, he said: The Yan bandits in Taiyuan are living in constant fear, not knowing when the People's Liberation Army will attack. After the 44th Division was wiped out by the People's Liberation Army, only the sick and wounded and more than 300 \"People's Defense Army\" soldiers remained. Now they are still called the 44th Division, just like a bankrupt shop, with a sign but no goods. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's planes are constantly transporting away factory machinery, which is making people even more panicked. Prices are rising several times a day. Now a cigarette costs 100,000 yuan, and private businesses are closing their doors. The people are eating soybean cakes and are hoping that the People's Liberation Army will liberate them quickly. He said: Yan's bandits earn 830,000 Chiang Kai-shek currency a day as privates, which is not even enough to buy a box of Truman cigarettes. They don't get enough to eat every day, and they have to tighten their belts to build fortifications. Their quilts are all lightly packed and taken to the city. They sleep in the fortifications at night, and at least six or seven out of ten people have scabies. The officers don't let the soldiers run away, but they all shave their heads and prepare plain clothes.\n\nAfter Tian Fuchang, a platoon leader of the 1st Company of the Yan bandit's 2nd Machine Gun Regiment, defected to us, he said: Don't say the new recruits are scared, I've been a soldier for eight years and I'm just as scared. My platoon has run away completely in the last ten days or so. Seven of us ran away together the day before yesterday. The company commander and battalion commander can't do anything about it, and those \"iron army backbone\" members can't monitor them either. As long as the brothers have a chance, they give each other a look, and then they run away. The officers eat and drink all day long, saying, \"Eat up, you won't get to eat it if you get killed when the Eighth Route Army comes.\" Many students have been forced into the army.

    "content": "[Jinzhong Electric] During the Jinzhong Campaign, tens of thousands of liberated civilian laborers and militia from 26 counties in Taiyue and Taihang enthusiastically supported the front lines. They traveled hundreds of miles to the front, undertaking intense combat support tasks, and demonstrating the fine traditions of the liberated area people's heroic struggle and hard work. After the Battle of Xiaochang, the third detachment of civilian laborers from Gaoping was supposed to be replaced by the fifth detachment; however, they all refused to leave, saying, \"The front is the same as the rear.\" On July 15th, when the front urgently needed ammunition, the civilian laborers from Yangcheng braved the frantic bombing of five enemy planes and transported ammunition twice in a row. Han Fugui, the company commander of the militia from Wuxiang, and his deputy calmly delivered ammunition to the soldiers during intense fighting, persisting until the battle ended. When civilian laborers from Yangcheng, Zuoquan, Gaoping, Wuxiang, and other counties encountered rain while transporting ammunition, they used their own clothes and straw hats to cover the ammunition. Hao Caiming, a civilian laborer from Wuxiang, carried a colored flag all the way while trying to find boiled water, and took out his own money to buy eggs for the wounded. Bi Mancheng, a civilian cook, was stationed in Xiangyuan Village, Taigu, and delivered meals to civilian laborers more than 30 miles from the front line. Li Baoquan, a militiaman from Qin County, detoured hundreds of miles from Rencun, Taigu, to Liwan, Qi County, to deliver letters, completing the glorious task twice. The civilian laborers and the masses in the new district had a good relationship. During breaks in the fighting, civilian laborers from Yangcheng, Xiangyuan, Zuoquan, Gaoping, and other counties helped the masses in the new district with weeding, hoeing, carrying water, and sweeping the courtyard, winning the support of the masses in the new district. The civilian laborers also implemented mass discipline and city discipline very well. Civilian laborers from Gaoping paid 100 yuan for breaking a villager's bowl. The seventh company of the Tunliu militia was assigned to guard Taigu City, and although the streets were full of items left behind by the enemy, no one took anything. They not only completed their due tasks but also captured many fleeing enemy soldiers and seized a lot of weapons. Wang Denglin, the militia company commander from Changzi, captured nine bandits and three Japanese soldiers in Rencun, killed a Japanese squad leader, and seized three rifles. According to incomplete statistics, the militia and civilian laborers from Qin County, Xiangyuan, Zanhuang, Gaoyi, Xingtai, Neiqiu, Yuanshi, and other counties captured more than 200 enemy soldiers (including three Japanese), killed one Japanese squad leader, and seized two machine guns, more than 150 rifles, four pistols, eight small cannons, 100 grenades, 3,781 bullets, 50 mountain artillery shells, two pairs of binoculars, and one telephone.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳太行二十六县数万民工　奋勇支援晋中作战\n\n1948-09-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳太行二十六县数万民工\n  　奋勇支援晋中作战\n    【晋中电】晋中战役中，太岳、太行二十六县×万翻身民工民兵热烈支前。他们从数百里外，奔赴前线，担负着紧张的参战任务，发挥了解放区人民英勇奋斗、吃苦耐劳的优良作风。高平三中队民工在小常战斗结束后，应由五分队接替他们的任务；但他们都不下来，并说“前方和后方一样。”阳城民工在七月十五日，前方急需弹药时，不顾五架敌机疯狂轰炸，一连运了两次。武乡民工连连长韩福贵和副连长二人，在战斗激烈时，很沉着的往战士跟前送弹药，坚持到战斗结束才下来。阳城、左权、高平、武乡等县的民工担运弹药时遇雨，他们就用自己的衣服草帽将弹药盖住，武乡民工郝才明，抬上彩号一路给找开水喝，并拿出自己的钱给伤员买鸡蛋吃。民工炊事员毕满成，在太谷襄垣村驻扎，给距前线三十多里远的民工送饭。沁县民兵李保全从太谷任村绕道百里，往祁县里湾送信，两次完成光荣任务。民工和新区群众的关系处得很好，阳城、襄垣、左权、高平等县的民工于战斗间隙中帮助新区群众锄苗、拔草、担水、扫院，获得新区群众的拥护。在群众纪律城市纪律上，民工也执行的很好，高平民工打了老乡一个碗，就赔了一百元，屯留民兵七连到太谷城担任警戒，见满街放着敌人遗留的东西，却没一人去拿。他们不但完成了自己应有的任务，还俘获了敌人很多溃兵，缴获了不少武器。长子民兵连长王登林在仁村就抓了九个匪军，三个日本人，打死一个日本小队长，缴步枪三支。据不完全统计，沁县，襄垣、赞皇、高邑、邢台、内邱、元氏等县民兵民工共俘虏匪军二百多名（内有日本人三名），打死日本小队长一名，缴获机枪两挺，步枪一百五十余支，短枪四支，小炮八门，手榴弹一百颗，子弹三千七百八十一发，山炮弹五十发，望远镜两付，电话机一架。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 29th: According to various sources, Xi'an students are currently trapped in an abyss of unemployment, school dropout, and forced conscription. Of the nearly one thousand students graduating from colleges and universities in the city this semester, the majority are unable to find jobs. Even in the case of the Business College, where job opportunities are relatively plentiful, less than half of the 130 graduates have employment prospects. Furthermore, the vast majority of the more than two thousand high school graduates have no opportunities for further education or employment. Tuition fees at all private primary and secondary schools have sharply increased for the next semester. Secondary school tuition fees are now collected in kind, with junior high students required to pay three bags of machine-milled flour per student, and senior high students required to pay four bags (in early July, the factory price was over 7.2 million per bag). Primary school tuition fees are over one million enemy currency. Of the more than 72,000 school-age children in the city, over 37,000 were already out of school; after this tuition increase, the number of dropouts will increase even further.\n\nHu Zongnan's bandit 119th Brigade openly went to the \"National\" 22nd Middle School to forcibly conscript students. When a student from Northwestern University was seized on the street and produced his school certificate, it was immediately torn to shreds. Although threatened by school dropout and hunger, the students still refused to sell their lives for Hu Zongnan. When Hu Zongnan asked the Law School of Northwestern University for one hundred people to train as so-called \"suppression of banditry and national reconstruction\" cadres, no one volunteered. Hu Zongnan sent his secretary to personally lobby and bribe, but still no one volunteered. The students said, \"Who wants to go and die for Hu Zongnan?!\" Before Yuncheng was liberated, students who had been lured to Xi'an under the coercion and supervision of Hu Zongnan's bandits were \"welcomed\" on the very first day of their arrival with posters all over the streets announcing \"Recruiting Youth Army.\" The next day, these notices were posted on the students' doors, and the third day they were posted inside the students' rooms, but still no one signed up. So on the fourth day, Hu Zongnan sent his staff to openly threaten that \"if you don't sign up, food rations will be stopped.\" The students immediately protested: \"We would rather die than be conscripted!\" As a result, food rations were immediately stopped. Five or six hundred people were crammed into the Shanxi Guild Hall at night, and roamed the streets during the day, suffering terribly under the torment of school dropout, unemployment, and hunger.\n\nUnder the persecution and destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries, an increasing number of students from Xi'an are voluntarily seeking refuge in the liberated areas. For example, students Song Changbin, Liu Baichuan, and others from Huayin County arrived safely in Luoyang in early July, and the democratic government has made proper arrangements for them. The students from Yuncheng who were deceived into going to Xi'an are also returning to southern Shanxi in a steady stream. The democratic government has set up reception centers to solve their living and learning problems. When Wang Lianbo, who had returned, spoke about the persecution suffered under the Kuomintang at a meeting of family members of students who had been deceived in Yuncheng, the families present all wept bitterly, demanding that the democratic government quickly rescue them. With the help of the democratic government, the number of students seeking refuge in and returning to the liberated areas is increasing daily.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 失业、失学、被抓当兵　西安学生陷入苦海　投奔解放区者日益增多\n\n1948-09-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　失业、失学、被抓当兵\n  　西安学生陷入苦海\n  　投奔解放区者日益增多\n    【新华社西北二十九日电】据各方消息：西安学生正陷于失业、失学及被抓去当兵的苦海中。该市本学期专科以上学校毕业的学生计近千人，大半找不到职业。即以就业机会较多的商专而论，毕业生一百三十人中，有就业机会者尚不及半数；而高中毕业的二千余学生，更绝大多数得不到升学或就业机会。各私立中小学，下学期学费均激增。中学学费改征实物，初中每生须交机器面粉三袋，高中每生四袋（七月初每袋厂价即在七百二十万以上）。小学学费在敌钞百万以上。该市学龄儿童七万二千余名中，原有三万七千余名失学，经此次学费增加后，失学人数将更增多。\n    胡匪之一一九旅曾公开到“国立”二十二中学抓学生当兵。西北大学某生在街上被抓时，拿出学校证书，但立即被撕得粉碎。虽然在失学与饥饿的威胁下，学生仍拒绝为胡匪卖命，胡匪向西大法学院要一百人去训练作所谓“戡建”干部，但无人报名，胡匪派秘书去亲自活动收买，仍然无人报名，学生们说：“谁愿意去给胡宗南送死呢？！”运城未解放前在胡匪威迫监押下被诱骗至西安的学生，在到达的第一天，胡匪即在街上满贴“招收青年军”来“欢迎”他们，第二天这些布告就贴到学生门口，第三天就贴到学生房子，但还是没有一个人去报名。于是第四天胡匪即派其参谋公开以“如不报名即停发粮食”相威胁，学生们随即提出抗议：“叫当兵，我们宁死不干！”于是伙食立即被停发，五、六百人黑夜挤在山西会馆里，白天流浪街头，在失学、失业与饥饿熬煎下痛苦不堪。\n    在国民党反动派迫害与摧残下，西安学生自动投奔解放区者正日益增多，如华阴县学生宋长斌、刘百川等多人即于七月初安抵洛阳，民主政府均妥为安置。而被骗到西安的运城学生，亦络绎返回晋南，民主政府特设招待所，以解决他们的生活及学习问题。当归来的王连伯在运城被骗员生家属会议上谈及受国民党迫害情形时，到会家属均嚎啕大哭，要求民主政府赶快拯救他们。现在民主政府帮助下，投奔及返回解放区的学生日众。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-01",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【Taihang Electric】\n\n　　The village of Hulei Mountain in Wu'an County is a village with a relatively solid foundation in mutual aid production. Starting in 1944, under the leadership of labor hero Wang Dazhuang, the entire village was organized for production. However, due to formalistic work styles, several serious deviations arose. The village once forcibly organized the entire village into a large mutual aid group, with some organizing communal dining, which the masses were unwilling to do, and cadres would label those who didn't as backward. Mutual aid teams had no freedom of movement; if the work wasn't finished, no one could freely leave. The entire village engaged in production competitions; as soon as the drum sounded, even if they hadn't finished eating, they had to get up and go to the fields. Sometimes many people would work on one piece of land, which looked fast on the surface but actually wasted a lot of labor. In order to win, teams worked tirelessly. Wang Ertang's team started early and worked late, once working more than eight *xiangs* in a day (normally five *xiangs* in a day), exhausting everyone. Mutual aid teams unilaterally emphasized taking care of the poor, hired laborers, and orphans, disadvantaging households with labor. The masses were dissatisfied with this approach. When party rectification began this spring, all the mutual aid teams and production brigades in the village, except for the small team led by labor hero Wang Dazhuang, which could still engage in mutual assistance on a small scale, completely collapsed. After party rectification, most cadres, influenced by certain deviations during the rectification, abandoned production leadership, and no one reorganized mutual aid. On the one hand, the masses still remembered the benefits of mutual aid in the past, but on the other hand, they felt that mutual aid in the past was too restrictive. The old members of Dazhuang's team often grumbled at mealtimes, asking Dazhuang if they would still engage in mutual aid this year. Dazhuang understood the masses' thinking, so he widely publicized the mutual aid policy, saying: This year, mutual aid will be implemented in a new way, with no forced organization; whoever wants to participate can participate. Under this genuine principle of voluntarism, before the wheat harvest, Shuanhe and 12 other households jointly organized a work exchange team, and everyone held a meeting to review past deviations and mistakes, and publicly elected Wang Dazhuang as the leader. Their mutual aid method was to exchange labor for labor, returning labor at any time, working together when needed, and each working separately when not needed. For the time being, only male laborers participated, without scoring points or using work points. When someone outside the team needed labor, they could simply tell Dazhuang, who would introduce someone to go. Whoever had surplus labor could freely decide among themselves, without restriction from the team leader. After the wheat harvest, the team used 242,000 yuan to buy two cotton ginning machines, deciding on a share of 10,000 yuan for a full share and 5,000 yuan for a half share, with whoever wanted to participate participating. Yincheng, Yinji, Yuanming, Changhui, and others who had previously jumped to other teams have now returned. When Si Laoben was hoeing seedlings, because he couldn't manage alone, he asked Dazhuang's team for four people, who finished hoeing in half a day. Later, he also joined the work exchange team. In this way, the work exchange team gradually expanded to 28 households, with 38 male full and half laborers, and 27 female full and half laborers, with a total of 355 mu of land. Everyone's production enthusiasm is very high, and they are currently rushing to hoe seedlings and make fertilizer, striving to hoe the millet one more time. This autumn, the entire team plans to plant 122 mu of wheat, aiming to apply 20 loads of fertilizer per mu.\n\n(Taihang Branch Press Note: The process of the Hulei Mountain mutual aid team from collapse to re-establishment shows that the masses, on the one hand, oppose forced orders and formalistic work styles, but also do not forget the benefits of mutual aid. As long as the leadership can earnestly correct deviations, clear up outstanding issues, and reorganize based on the principles of voluntarism and equivalent exchange, the masses are willing to engage in mutual aid. Some comrades only see the side of the masses opposing formalism and forced orders in mutual aid, and do not see the side of the masses benefiting from mutual aid in the past. Therefore, they completely negate the achievements of past organization and allow it to collapse on its own, which is an extreme and erroneous approach. Reorganizing mutual aid must have strong and effective leadership, promoting the good and correcting the bad, so that mutual aid teams can develop forward and become conscious and voluntary production organizations of the masses. In the reorganization, it is necessary to oppose the tailism of abandoning leadership.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 忽雷山群众不忘互助好处　改进领导又组织起来\n\n1948-09-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　忽雷山群众不忘互助好处\n  　改进领导又组织起来\n    【太行电】武安忽雷山村是一个互助生产较有基础的村庄。该村从一九四四年起，在劳英王大庄带领下，全村组织起来进行生产。但由于形式主义作风，产生了若干严重的偏向。该村曾强迫编制全村大互助，有的组织大锅集体吃饭，群众不愿这样做，干部就说人家落后。互助组出入不自由，如果活做不完，谁也不能自由出外。全村进行生产竞赛，一打鼓，就是吃不完饭，也得站起队往地里走。有时许多人到一块地上做活，表面上看着很快，实际上浪费了不少劳力。各组为了争胜，不顾疲劳的一直干。王二堂组搭黑起早，一天曾赶过八晌（一般一天五晌），把人都累坏了。互助组片面强调照顾贫雇孤寡，使有劳力户吃亏。对于这种作法，群众都不满意。今春整党一开始，全村的互助组和生产大队，除了劳英王大庄领导的小组还能三三两两拨工互助外，其余全部垮台。整党后，大部分干部由于整党时的某些偏向影响了工作情绪，放弃了生产领导，互助没人整顿。群众一方面对过去互助得到的利益还念念不忘，另一方面却感到过去互助受拘束太厉害。大庄组的旧组员在饭场上就经常圪嚷，问大庄今年还互助不互助。大庄摸透了群众的心思，便广泛宣传互助政策说：今年互助要实行一种新的方式，决不能强迫编制，谁愿意参加就参加。在这种真正的自愿原则下，麦收前拴和等十三户便共同组织起一个拨工组，大家开会检讨了过去的偏向和错误，公选王大庄为领导人。他们的互助办法都是工拨工，随时还工，需要时就伙干，不需要时就各干各的。暂时只有男劳力参加，没有评分，也未使用工票，组外有人需要劳力时，与大庄一说，便可介绍人去。谁有剩余劳力，由他们相互自由决定，组长不加限制。麦收后，组内用了二十四万二千元买了两辆弹花车，决定一万元一股，五千元半股，谁愿参加谁参加。银成、银吉、元明、长会等过去跳到别组，现在又回来了。四老笨在锄头遍苗时，因一个人赶不过来，便向大庄组找了四个人，半天就锄完了。后来他也参加了变工队。这样变工队逐渐扩大到二十八户，男全半劳力三十八个，女全半劳力二十七个，共土地三百五十五亩。大家生产情绪很高，现正突击锄苗造肥，争取谷子多锄一遍。秋后全队计划种麦一百二十二亩，每亩做到上肥二十驮。\n    （太行分社按：忽雷山互助组从垮台而再起的过程，说明群众一方面是反对强迫命令与形式主义的作风，但也并不忘记互助的好处。只要领导上能认真纠正偏向，清理遗留问题，根据自愿等价原则来整顿，群众是愿意互助的。有些同志只看到群众反对互助中形式主义与强迫命令的一面，看不到群众过去因互助得利的一面，因此就完全否定过去组织起来的成绩，一任其自流垮台，这是走了极端，是错误的。整顿互助必须有强有力的领导，发扬好的，纠正坏的，使互助组能向前发展，成为群众自觉自愿的生产组织。在整顿中要反对放弃领导的尾巴主义。）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's so-called \"currency reform\" announced on the 19th, stating: This is a massive inflation, a massive fraud, and a massive plunder. This is a gangster tactic by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to make a final struggle and prepare its own escape route, looting the wealth of the people of the whole country into the pockets of the four major families. The result will inevitably cause greater chaos in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and accelerate the final collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's reactionary rule.\n　　The total amount of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"Gold Yuan\" is, according to those who announced it, 2 billion. Each \"Gold Yuan\" is equal to 3 million \"Legal Tender.\" The amount of \"Legal Tender\" and \"Northeast Circulation Certificates\" in circulation is, according to Wang Yunwu, the Minister of Finance of the Chiang Kai-shek government, \"only 200 million Gold Yuan is needed to recover them.\" That is to say, the \"currency reform\" nominally reduces the amount of currency in circulation, from 600 trillion \"Legal Tender\" to 2 billion \"Gold Yuan,\" but in reality, it increases the amount of currency in circulation tenfold, from 200 million \"Gold Yuan\" to 2 billion \"Gold Yuan,\" or from 600 trillion \"Legal Tender\" to 60 trillion \"Legal Tender,\" which is to inflate the currency tenfold. In terms of the largest denomination of Chiang's currency, it is now 5 million \"Legal Tender\" per note, while Chiang Kai-shek's \"Gold Yuan\" is 100 yuan per note. One hundred yuan \"Gold Yuan\" is equal to 30 million \"Legal Tender.\" That is to say, the \"currency reform\" nominally reduces the largest denomination of Chiang's currency from 5 million to 100, but in reality, it increases from 5 million to 300 million, an increase of sixtyfold. Increasing the currency tenfold and increasing the largest denomination sixtyfold, isn't this a massive currency inflation?\n　　In order to realize this massive inflation, Chiang Kai-shek set up an unprecedented massive fraud, claiming that the \"Gold Yuan\" has \"full backing,\" and even pretending to be serious, saying that \"each yuan is legally defined to contain 0.22217 grams of pure gold,\" and establishing a \"Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee,\" allocating \"40 percent of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, and 60 percent of the assets of state-owned enterprises and enemy and puppet industries,\" as if there really is \"full backing.\" In fact, foxes always have tails, and ogres always have fangs. The \"Gold Yuan\" cannot be cashed, nor can it be used to freely purchase foreign exchange. It is still a fictitious gold standard currency, just like the \"Legal Tender.\" As A.E. Aczia, the owner of an American bank in Shanghai, said, this is just \"exchanging one piece of paper for another.\" The real purpose of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called \"full backing\" is to use this as a pretext to defraud and attract gold, silver, and foreign currencies from the people and put them in his \"Central Bank,\" which is to say, put them in the vaults of the four major families. On the other hand, he can also organize companies and issue stocks with the designated assets of state-owned enterprises, turning the industries that the four major families cannot move when they flee into liquid funds. This is truly killing two birds with one stone, truly an unprecedented massive fraud. To put it bluntly, Chiang Kai-shek could not even maintain the \"Legal Tender\" and \"Northeast Circulation Certificates,\" which could be recovered with only one-tenth of the funds of the so-called \"full backing,\" so how can he maintain the \"Gold Yuan,\" which is ten times that amount? Isn't this a fraud?\n　　It can be predicted that because most of the \"Legal Tender\" has become waste paper, the people will no longer trust Chiang's currency, even if it is called \"Gold Yuan.\" Because no one wants to hand over gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign exchange to the four major families, Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, Chiang Ching-kuo, Zhang Li-sheng and others will inevitably use fascist means to carry out inspection and plunder. The result will inevitably cause the wealthy to evade and hide their assets, and the market to become chaotic. Furthermore, because the Chiang Kai-shek government's issuance, taxation, and expenditures have increased more than tenfold, the income is not enough to cover the expenditures. Moreover, due to the repeated defeats of the Kuomintang reactionary army and the shrinking of the controlled areas, the economic bankruptcy will inevitably be aggravated, prices will inevitably rise, the black market will inevitably be revived, the \"Gold Yuan\" will inevitably depreciate, market speculation will inevitably become more uncontrollable, the lives of public employees and workers will inevitably be further deteriorated, and the army will also lose its fighting spirit. Therefore, the result of the \"currency reform\" will inevitably cause greater chaos in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas and accelerate the final collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Even if this \"currency reform,\" due to Chiang Kai-shek's suppression and deception, combined with material assistance from American imperialism, may cause a temporary paralyzing effect, the entire decline of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, especially the inevitable failure of the anti-people war, no matter how much assistance American imperialism provides, cannot prevent this trend of greater chaos and final collapse. This has been repeatedly proven by the facts in the past few years.\n　　Chiang Kai-shek arranged such a massive fraud to achieve disguised currency inflation, the purpose of which is to carry out unprecedented plunder. For several months before the \"currency reform,\" the Chiang Kai-shek government deliberately accelerated the reduction of the \"Legal Tender\" price, issuing large amounts of banknotes three times in a row, so that the \"Legal Tender\" in the hands of the broad masses of the people had depreciated to less than one-tenth in three months. Once the \"currency reform\" came into effect, it first announced that all \"Legal Tender\" and \"Northeast Circulation Certificates\" must be exchanged before November 20th of this year. With the current transportation conditions and price fluctuations, wouldn't most of the \"Legal Tender\" held by the broad masses of people in vast rural areas and remote cities throughout the country become waste paper? The gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currencies held by the people are all limited to being exchanged at the Central Bank before September 30th, and foreign exchange assets are limited to being registered before December 31st, which is to plunder all the people's gold and silver treasures, including those of the bourgeoisie. Wang Yunwu said that the Chiang Kai-shek government's annual expenditure will reach 3.6 billion \"Gold Yuan.\" Judging from the actual number of \"Gold Yuan\" issued, the people's burden has already increased tenfold. If they have to bear such a heavy annual expenditure again, it is unknown how many times the burden will increase in the future. However, the cost of living index for public employees and workers has been cancelled all at once. The main reason why Chiang Kai-shek implemented such an unprecedented plunder plan is to make the biggest struggle in the military, and to sweep the wealth of the people of the whole country into the vaults of the four major families, preparing to flee overseas in the event of final defeat, while throwing the Chinese people into the abyss of poverty. The Nanjing Heping Daily stated on the 21st that this currency plan was drafted by Kong Xiangxi in the United States. This makes it very clear that Chiang Kai-shek sent Soong Tzu-wen, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Zhang Li-sheng to plunder money in South China, Central China, and North China respectively, sent Kong Xiangxi to borrow money in the United States, and sent Chen Li-fu to contact reactionary leaders in the United States and Britain. All these preparations are clearly for the above-mentioned purpose.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新华社记者　评蒋匪“改革币制”　以变相大膨胀实行空前大掠夺\n\n1948-09-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新华社记者\n  　评蒋匪“改革币制”\n  　以变相大膨胀实行空前大掠夺\n    【新华社陕北二十八日电】新华社记者评十九日蒋匪宣布的所谓“改革币制”称：这是一次大膨胀、大骗局和大掠夺。这是蒋介石匪帮为了最后挣扎并准备自己退路，把全国人民财富掳进四大家族腰包的流氓手段。其结果必定在国民党统治区引起更大混乱，促进蒋介石匪帮反动统治的最后崩溃。\n    蒋匪的所谓“金圆券”，总额据宣布者为二十亿。每元“金圆券”等于“法币”三百万元。现在“法币”及“东北流通券”的发行量，据蒋匪政府财政部长王云五说：“仅需二亿元金圆券即可收回”，这就是说，“改革币制”形式上是缩小了发行量，由六百万亿“法币”改为廿亿“金圆券”，实际上却是增多了十倍发行量，由二亿“金圆券”增至二十亿“金圆券”，或由六百万亿“法币”增至六千万亿“法币”，就是把通货膨胀十倍。就蒋币最大票面额来说，现在是五百万元“法币”一张，蒋匪的“金圆券”是一百元一张。一百元“金圆券”等于“法币”三万万元。这就是说，“改革币制”形式上是把蒋币的最大票面额由五百万减至一百，实际上却是由五百万增至三万万，一下子提高了六十倍。把通货增加十倍，把最大票面额提高六十倍，这不是一次通货大膨胀是什么？\n    蒋匪为了实现此次大膨胀，布置了一个空前大骗局，说什么“金圆券”有“十足准备”，并且还装腔作势，说什么“每元法定含纯金零点二二二一七公分”，成立什么“金圆券发行准备监理委员会”，拨交“百分之四十的黄金、白银与外汇，百分之六十的国营事业资产及敌伪产业”，似乎真有“十足准备”。其实，狐狸总有尾巴，夜叉总有獠牙，“金圆券”一来不能兑现，二来不能自由购买外汇，仍旧与“法币”一样，是虚金本位币，正如上海一个美商银行老板艾齐亚所说，这不过是“把一张纸换成另一张纸”。而蒋匪所谓“十足准备”的真正目的，却是打起这个幌子，一方面，好以此为圈套来骗取和吸引民间的金银外币，放到他的“央行”里去，也就是放进四大家族的金库里去；另一方面，又可以把指定的国营事业的资产，组织公司，发行股票，把四大家族将来逃走时搬不动的产业，一下子变成流动资金。这真是一箭双雕，真是空前未有的大骗局。戳穿了说，蒋匪既对只要用现在所谓“十足准备”的十分之一的基金就能收回的“法币”和“东北流通券”，都维持不了，那又何能维持十倍于此数的“金圆券”呢？这不是骗局是什么？\n    可以预言：由于“法币”多数成为废纸，人民对于蒋币，即使叫“金圆券”也好，不会再有信任，由于人民谁也不愿把金、银、白洋、外汇交给四大家族，因而蒋介石、宋子文、蒋经国、张厉生等势必要用法西斯的手段施行检查与掠夺，其结果必然引起有资产者的逃避藏匿和市场的混乱。又由于蒋匪政府的发行、税收和开支都比从前增加了十倍以上，所入还不足支出之用；更由于国民党反动军队的处处失败，统治地区日益缩小，因之经济破产必将加剧，物价必将上涨，黑市必将复活，“金圆券”必将贬值，市场投机必将更加不可收拾，公教人员和工人的生活必将更加恶化，而军队也将更加丧失斗志。故“改革币制”的结果，必然引起蒋匪统治区的更大混乱，促进蒋匪统治的最后崩溃。即使这次“改革币制”，由于蒋匪的镇压和欺骗，双管齐下，加以美帝国主义的物资援助，或可引起一时的麻痹作用，但国民党反动统治的整个衰亡，尤其是反人民战争之不可避免地失败，不管美帝国主义有多大援助，都无法阻止这种更加混乱和最后崩溃的趋势，这是过去数年再三再四经过事实证明了的。\n    蒋匪布置这样一个大骗局，来实现变相的通货大膨胀，其目的在于实行空前的大掠夺。“改革币制”前数月，蒋匪政府故意加速降低“法币”价格，连发三次大钞，使广大人民手中的法币在三个月内已经贬值至十倍以下。“改革币制”一来，首先宣布所有“法币”和“东北流通券”限于本年十一月二十日以前兑完。以现在这样的交通条件，这样的物价波动，三个月内全国广大乡村和偏僻城市的广大人民所持有的“法币”，岂不多数成为废纸？人民持有的黄金、白银、银币及外币，统限于九月三十日前向中央银行兑换，外汇资产限于十二月三十一日以前申请登记，这就是要把所有人民包括资产阶级在内的金银财宝都掳掠而去。王云五说，蒋匪政府岁出要达到三十六亿“金圆券”，单从“金圆券”发行的实际数目看，人民的负担已经增加十倍，若再负担这样重的岁出，今后的倍数更不知伊于胡底，而公教人员及工人的薪资的生活指数却一下子都取消了。蒋匪所以实行这样一个空前的掠夺计划，主要是为在军事上进行最大的挣扎，并把全国人民的财富席卷而入于四大家族金库，准备在最后失败时，好逃往海外，而把中国人民抛入穷困的深渊。南京和平日报二十一日称，此次货币计划，系孔祥熙在美国拟就。这就很明白，蒋匪派了宋子文、蒋经国、张厉生替他分别在华南、华中、华北掳钱，派了孔祥熙在美国借帐，派了陈立夫与美英反动头子接洽，这一切准备，显然是为着上述目的。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-01",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "(Taixing Electric Telegram) In the Jinzhong front, the eighth squad of combat hero Li HaiShui of a certain unit of our field army, in evaluating the victory in the Jinzhong campaign and rectifying their thinking, the soldiers used their own experiences and the specific facts they were most familiar with to analyze the ten major comparisons between the enemy and ourselves. This helped them to more clearly recognize their own strength and the enemy's corruption, find the reasons why we can win battles, and strengthen their confidence in capturing Taiyuan. This is a new creation in the army's mass political rectification. The materials of the ten major comparisons can not only serve as a reference for political rectification in their unit, but also as a reference for the current affairs study of participating militiamen, laborers, and the masses in the rear. The details are as follows:\n\n(1) In terms of weapons, since the Linfen and Jinzhong campaigns, we have annihilated more than 100,000 of Yan’s regular troops, obtaining thousands of large and small artillery pieces. Now we have more weapons and ammunition than the enemy.\n\n(2) In terms of troop strength, each enemy company has only 30 to 50 soldiers, all of whom want to desert and are unwilling to fight. Our army's companies are all at full strength. In the Dachang annihilation battle, one of our companies was able to wipe out four or five enemy companies.\n\n(3) In terms of the number of the masses, almost the entire Shanxi is about to be liberated. We have the support of the people of Shanxi. Yan Xishan now only rules over hundreds of thousands of people in the isolated city of Taiyuan.\n\n(4) In terms of materials and supplies, we have supplies from the rear. Yan Xishan is trapped in an isolated city, and his supplies and ammunition are limited, like water in a stagnant pit, which will be exhausted after being used up.\n\n(5) In terms of morale, our soldiers are all here to defend their emancipated fruits or their own liberation, and their fighting is brave and tenacious. The enemy is forcibly conscripted and fundamentally opposes fighting, and they are defeated as soon as they fight.\n\n(6) In terms of war support, our militiamen, laborers, stretcher teams, etc., are all volunteers, transporting ammunition on the front line and rescuing the wounded. The enemy randomly grabs ordinary people on the battlefield, and the people slip away at any opportunity, abandoning the wounded soldiers.\n\n(7) In terms of combat, we are actively attacking fortified positions, and we can fight whenever we want, and the troops can take turns to rest. The enemy is on the defensive, with few troops, and has to defend the city fortifications day and night, getting no rest at all.\n\n(8) In terms of relations with the masses, we protect the interests of the people, and we buy and sell fairly wherever we go, not taking a needle or thread from the people. The masses welcome us. The Yan bandit army robs things wherever they go, beating and oppressing the masses, causing opposition from the masses.\n\n(9) Officer-soldier relationship: In the People's Liberation Army, officers and soldiers are united and friendly, and are completely equal politically. In Yan's army, there is oppression at every level, high-ranking officers bully low-ranking officers, and soldiers bully the common people. They oppose each other, and therefore have no strength.\n\n(10) Comparing the Liberated Areas with the Yan-occupied areas, the people in the Liberated Areas all have land to cultivate and houses to live in, living in peace and working happily, with freedom and happiness. In Yan's controlled areas, one must have \"three major certificates\" to go out, otherwise they are \"disguised.\" Strong men are all arrested, and the land is barren. Countless people starve to death or are forced to death. This is the reason for Yan's inevitable demise.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋中我军某部对比敌我条件　明确认识自己力量攻取太原信心更坚\n\n1948-09-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋中我军某部对比敌我条件\n  　明确认识自己力量攻取太原信心更坚\n    【太行电】太原前线我野战兵团某部战斗英雄李海水连八班，在评晋中胜利战役与整顿思想中，战士们以亲身经历的和自己最熟悉的具体事实，研究出敌我十大对比，更明确地认识了自己力量和敌人的腐败，找到我们所以能打胜仗的原因，坚定了攻取太原的信心。这是部队群众性政治整训的一种新的创造。十大对比材料，不仅可作为其部队政治整训中的参考，而且也可作为参战民兵民工及后方群众时事学习的参考。兹特介绍如下：（一）从武器上来比，我们自临汾和晋中战役以来，共歼灭阎匪正规军十万余人，得大小炮数千门，现在各种武器弹药比敌人都多。（二）从兵力上比，敌每连是三十人至五十人，还都是想开小差，不愿打仗的，我军各连则都是满员的。在大常歼灭战中，我一连能消灭敌四、五个连。（三）从群众多少来比，全山西都快解放了，我们得到全山西人民的拥护，阎锡山现只统治太原孤城的几十万老百姓。（四）物质上、给养上来比，我们有后方接济，阎锡山困守孤城，给养和弹药有限，好比死水坑道的水一样，吃完就没有了。（五）士气上来比，我们的战士都是为保卫自己翻身果实或自己的解放而来的，作战是勇敢顽强的，敌人是编组强行抓来的人根本反对打仗，一打就败。（六）战勤上来比，我们的民兵民工担架队等都是自愿出来的，在火线上运送弹药，把伤员救下来，敌人则在战场上乱抓老百姓，老百姓抽空就溜，伤兵都扔了。（七）从作战上来比，我们是主动的攻坚战，想什么时候打就什么时候打，队伍能替换着休息；敌人是防御战，兵力又少，昼夜都得死守城碉，一点得不到休息。（八）从群众关系方面来比，我们是爱护人民利益的，走到哪里都是公买公卖，不拿人民一针一线，群众都欢迎我们；阎匪军则走到哪里都是乱抢东西，打骂压迫群众，引起群众反对。（九）官兵关系：解放军是官兵一致，团结友爱，政治上完全平等的；阎匪是一级压一级，大官欺小官，当兵的欺侮老百姓，互相反对，也就没有力量。（十）解放区与阎占区来比，解放区的群众是人人有地种，人人有房住，安居乐业，自由幸福；阎匪统治区一出门就要“三大证”，否则即是“伪装”。壮丁都抓走，土地都荒芜，饿死逼死的人就不知道有多少，这就是阎匪必然死亡的原因。"

    "content": "【Taiyue Telegram】Qinshui began rectifying and restoring mutual aid teams in June and has achieved preliminary experience: (1) Party members and cadres should personally lead the rectification, acknowledge the past mistakes of forced mutual aid, and emphasize the implementation of the principle of voluntary exchange of equal value. This not only rectifies the mutual aid but also restores the authority of the leadership. (2) Thoroughly understand the reasons for the collapse, examine the problems in past mutual aid, and thoroughly rectify and transform. For example, in the Li Zhenwen team of Guzhen Village, District 1, a meeting was first held to examine the problems. It was found that Cui Zhuguo and others plowed the land for households without cattle last year but did not earn fodder, which made them unwilling to help each other and gradually withdrew. This team truly solved the problems identified in the examination, and everyone agreed to reorganize. (3) The organization of mutual aid teams should be based on families to ensure that the family's production pace is consistent, which can reduce conflicts between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and can combine family odd jobs with the collective labor of the mutual aid team. (4) Production plans and various systems should be democratically established, and the regulations for wages, work point evaluation, accounting time, and work review should be decided through democratic discussion and not by coercion. (5) Accounts should be settled in a timely manner according to the production season so that what is earned can be obtained early to solve one's own difficulties. Wages should be paid in installments to avoid accumulating them until they cannot be paid at once. At the same time, in the case of unstable prices, it is better to settle wages in a timely manner, which can also stimulate those who pay wages to work hard and strive to pay less. (6) The labor unit of the mutual aid team should not be too large, as poor planning with too many people easily wastes time. The order of doing work is also difficult to resolve. Large teams can be divided into several sub-teams to do work, but efforts should be made to achieve unified leadership.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 沁水整顿互助获得六项经验\n\n1948-09-01\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　沁水整顿互助获得六项经验\n    【太岳电】沁水在六月开始整顿与恢复互助组，已取得初步经验：（一）党员干部应亲自领导整顿，承认过去强迫互助的错误，强调贯彻自愿等价的原则。这样作既整顿了互助，又恢复了领导威信。（二）深入了解垮台的原因，检查过去互助中的毛病，彻底整顿改造。如一区固镇村李振文组，先开会检查毛病，发现崔柱国等去年给没牛户犁了地，没赚上草料，弄得不想互助，慢慢的退后了。这个组真正解决了检查出的毛病，大家都同意重新组织起来。（三）组织互助组，应以家庭为单位，作到家庭生产步调一致，可以减少夫妇间与婆媳间的矛盾，并可使家庭零活和互助组集体劳动结合起来。（四）民主订出生产计划和各种制度，规定工资，评定工分，算帐时间，工作检讨等，都要经过民主讨论决定，不能强迫命令。（五）按生产季节及时算帐，该得的可以早得，解决自己的困难。该出工资的零星出了，免得积累起来一下出不起。同时在物价不稳的情况下，及时清理工资是比较好的，也能刺激出工资的人好好劳动，争取少出工资。（六）互助组的劳动单位不宜过大，人多计划不好，容易浪费时间。做活先后问题也不好解决。组大的可分为几个小组做活，但要设法作到统一领导。"

Xi Zixian, a habitual bandit in western Henan and deputy commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang's Yu (County), Chang (Ge), Yan (Ling), Fu (Gou), and Wei (Chuan) five counties, as well as Kuomintang County Magistrate of Yu County, had been committing crimes in the Yu County area for over ten years. The People's Liberation Army arrested him near Zhengzhou on June 19th. People from various counties formed groups to file accusations with the democratic government. After a thorough trial by the People's Court of the Yu County Democratic Government, he was found guilty and sentenced to death according to the law. On July 27th, a mass meeting was held in Yu County to announce his crimes and carry out the execution by firing squad, which greatly pleased the people. At the meeting, the democratic government also reiterated its lenient policy, calling on scattered bandits to recognize the overall situation and repent and reform as soon as possible. Bandit Xi began looting and plundering in the Yu County area in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Later, he was incorporated into the Kuomintang army and became an official bandit, intensifying his crimes, slaughtering the people, and acting tyrannically, committing all kinds of evil. Later, he surrendered to the Japanese invaders and actively massacred anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang again appointed him as a brigade commander, and then transferred him to his current position. After the liberation of western Henan, our army and the democratic government have consistently adopted a lenient policy of striving for defection towards bandits and scattered Kuomintang bandit troops who were wandering around. However, Bandit Xi remained unrepentant. In May of this year, when Bandit Xi harassed Yu County, he buried 37 merchants and civilians alive within five days. In total, Bandit Xi has successively killed more than 3,000 people in Yu County, Mi County, Dengfeng County, and other counties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 禹县民主政府人民法庭审讯确实　判处惯匪席子献死刑\n\n1948-09-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　禹县民主政府人民法庭审讯确实\n  　判处惯匪席子献死刑\n    【新华社中原二十九日电】豫西惯匪、国民党禹（县）、长（葛）、鄢（陵）、扶（沟）、洧（川）五县副总指挥兼禹县县长席子献在禹县一带为非作歹业经十余年。解放军于六月十九日在郑州附近将其逮获，各县人民成群结队向民主政府控告，经禹县民主政府人民法庭审讯确实，依法判处死刑，于七月二十七日在禹县召开群众大会，宣布罪状，执行枪决，人心大快。会上，民主政府并重申宽大政策，号召散匪认清大局，早日悔过自新。席匪抗战初期即在禹县一带打家劫舍，后经国民党收编成官土匪，乃变本加厉，屠杀人民，横行霸道，无恶不作。后即投降日寇，积极屠杀抗日军民。日寇投降后，国民党又加委作旅长，转任现职。豫西解放，我军与民主政府对土匪与零散流窜的土著国民党匪军始终采取争取反正的宽大政策。但席匪怙恶不悛，今年五月席匪窜扰禹县城时，五天内即活埋商民三十七人。总计席匪先后杀害禹县、密县、登封等县人民在三千人以上。"

Lichengpo and Cheng'an villages are a little over half a kilometer apart, and they jointly hired a teacher who rotates between the villages to teach every morning and afternoon. After class, \"little teachers\" lead self-study. To overcome the difficulty of \"not being able to teach,\" the little teachers are first taught phonetic symbols to look up small dictionaries. Even when the teacher is not present, the \"little teachers\" can teach literacy. Currently, eighteen fourth-grade students have all learned to use dictionaries. Mazhu administrative village has two schools, with the branch school teacher being兼 (concurrently) held by the administrative village school teacher. Every afternoon, the teacher goes to the village to lecture the children on books and judge imitations (large characters), and correct compositions. After the lecture, the little teachers also lead tutoring. Every Sunday, they hold an achievement exhibition together, visiting each other to learn from each other. This overcomes the difficulty of small villages not being able to afford teachers, allowing children in scattered small villages to have the opportunity to learn.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 轮回教学运用小先生制　立城坡普及山庄儿童教育\n\n1948-09-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　轮回教学运用小先生制\n  　立城坡普及山庄儿童教育\n    【太岳二十一日电】济源立城坡马主等村用轮回轮导，组织“小先生”领导自学的办法，普及山庄小村儿童的识字教育。立城坡和成庵全村相离一里多，伙请着一个教员，每日上下午轮流到各庄上课，下课后由“小先生”领导自学。为了克服“教不了”的困难，先教小先生注音符号查小字典。教员不在，“小先生”也能教识字。现在四年级十八个学生，都已学会查字典。马主行政村，有两个学校，分校教员由行政村学校教员兼，每天下午到庄上给儿童讲书判仿（大字），改作文。讲后也由小先生领导补习。每星期日并在一块举行成绩展览，互相参观，这样克服了村小请不起教员的困难，使分散的小庄上的儿童也得到了学习的机会。"

    "content": "To Adapt to the Masses' Demand for Increased Culture After Land Reform\n  　Jin Sui Restores Formal Education System\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th】 Due to severe disasters, school education in Jin Sui has suffered greatly in the past two years. At present, in order to adapt to the masses' urgent demand for improving culture after the land reform, various places have been actively engaged in restoring school education according to the degree of disaster reduction in their respective areas. The Jin Sui Sub-bureau also issued the \"Instructions on Restoring School Education in Disaster Areas\" to party committees at all levels on \"August 1st.\" It pointed out that schools that have been closed down in various places should be restored step by step and with emphasis, according to the specific situation. The educational policy should focus on cultural and professional courses. Extracurricular activities, in addition to student self-government activities, should be reduced as much as possible in terms of meetings and production. The years of study for students should be strictly implemented according to regulations, and they should not be arbitrarily sent in or transferred out. Children of all classes, including those of landlords and rich peasants, should have the opportunity to enroll. Public expense quotas should be appropriately established for poor military, martyrs' families, and general poor children to solve their enrollment difficulties. In addition, various schools should immediately try out half-day classes and night classes, and winter schools should be opened in winter. Each county should also try out a cadre class in primary schools, etc., to provide more learning opportunities for farmers, farm women, and new and old cadres who are busy with production. Regarding the issue of teachers, the instructions pointed out that regardless of their background or past experience, intellectuals who are competent in academic ability can be requested by the government for appointment, except for those who are indeed counter-revolutionaries. Those who have been transferred to other positions after the land reform should be requested by the government to be transferred back to educational positions, and those who have been suspended at home should be reinstated. A group of cadres, especially women cadres, should be transferred to school education work according to the actual situation, and teacher training classes should be held during the gap between semesters to actively pay attention to cultivating and improving teachers. At present, the original experimental schools, Chengcheng, Helong, Hechang, No. 1 Middle School, and No. 2 Middle School in the old areas of Jin Northwest have been restored from short-term training courses for district and village cadres to formal education systems, and have begun to enroll new students in various places. Each county in Lan County, Lin County, Lishi, and Zhongyang has restored one or two complete primary schools and more than ten general primary schools. In addition to the original teachers, more than 300 students were transferred from Helong Middle School to serve as teachers in various places. All primary and secondary schools in the new districts will start school after the summer vacation. Linfen currently has Linfen Middle School, Linfen Normal School, and Private Pingshui Middle School, with nearly 2,000 students. Linfen Middle School was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit wounded soldiers' hospitals before liberation. After active repairs and rectification by the democratic government, enrollment and school began, and there are nearly 1,000 students. Pingshui Middle School was formed by the merger of Private Fenbin and Zili schools, with Zhang Zigao, the former principal of Zili Middle School, and Pan Fengzhi, the principal of Fenbin Middle School, serving as principals and vice principals respectively. Part of the funding is subsidized by the government. Xinjiang Middle School and the city's four complete primary schools also started school in July, and the number of students has greatly increased compared to the past.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 适应土改后群众要求提高文化的呼声　晋绥恢复正规学制\n\n1948-09-01\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　适应土改后群众要求提高文化的呼声\n  　晋绥恢复正规学制\n    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】晋绥学校教育近两年来因严重灾荒，损失极大。目前为适应土地改革后群众迫切要求提高文化的呼声，各地已按当地灾情减轻程度，积极从事恢复学校教育的工作。晋绥分局并于“八一”向各级党委发出“关于恢复受灾区域学校教育的指示”。指出各地停办之学校应即按具体情况有步骤有重点的加以恢复。教育方针应以文化课、业务课为主。课外活动除学生自治活动外，开会、生产等应尽量减少。学生受业年限应认真按规定执行，不得任意送进调出。各阶层子弟包括地主富农子弟在内均应有入学机会。对贫苦军、烈属及一般贫穷子弟应适当设立公费名额，解决其入学困难。此外各校应即试办半日班、夜班，冬季开办冬学，各县并在完小内试办一个干部班等，予生产繁忙的农民农妇及新老干部以更多的学习机会。关于师资问题，指示指出：不论何种出身，有过何种经历的知识分子，凡学识能力称职者，除确系反革命分子外，均可提请政府任用。土改后调任他职者，应请政府调回教育岗位，停职在家者，应予复职。并应根据实际情况调一批干部特别是妇女干部转入学校教育工作，及利用学期空隙办教员训练班，积极注意培养与提高师资。目前晋西北老区原有之实验学校、成成、贺龙、贺昌、一中、二中等中学，已由训练区村干部的短期班制恢复为正规学制，开始在各地招收新生。岚县、临县、离石、中阳等每县已恢复完小一、二所及普小十余所，各地除原有教员外，另由贺龙中学抽调三百余学生任职。新区各中小学校则于暑假期满后全部开学。临汾现有临汾中学、临汾师范及私立平水中学三所，有学生近两千名。临汾中学解放前为蒋阎匪伤兵医院霸占，经民主政府积极修理整顿后，招生开学，现有学生近千人。平水中学系由私立汾滨及自立两校合并而成，由原自立中学校长张子高，汾滨中学校长潘逢治分任正副校长，经费由政府补助一部。新绛中学及该市完小四所亦均于七月开学，学生较前大增。"

Zhang Xianjue, the captured Hu匪 (Nationalist soldier) Major General Staff Officer of the reorganized 36th Division during the Huanglong Campaign, recently told reporters that the Hu匪 army lacked the spirit of attack even during offensives, and their morale was extremely low. He said: In this operation, Zhong Song (commander of the 36th Division) advocated: \"Not losing soldiers is equivalent to winning a battle.\" Therefore, what we set up did not look like an \"offensive\" but rather a defensive posture. And after your army seized Hutishan, Zhong Song led a few guards and fled without notifying anyone. He also said: \"Since our (referring to the Hu army) defeat in the Jingwei Campaign, we have been under attack on three sides. To the east, we have to defend against western Henan; to the south, we have to defend against southern Shaanxi; and to the north, we have to defend against your army. Your army is completely in an active position and can take northern Wei to the south, enter Jingwei directly to Baoji, and advance into Hanzhong. Our troops are insufficient, and defense is extremely difficult. Everyone feels that the future is bleak.

He was captured on the evening of the 9th in the Yijing area, more than ten miles north of Chengcheng.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: Moscow dispatch: The New Times magazine, published on June 2nd, carried an article entitled \"The Situation in India,\" which described the high tide of the Indian peasant movement, stating: In many parts of India, the peasant movement has reached the scale of mass uprisings. A powerful peasant movement has developed in the Hyderabad State, which has a population of over 16 million. Hyderabad is a multi-ethnic state, with Andhras accounting for over 50% of its residents, Marathis nearly 30%, Shannalis nearly 10%, and Indians only 10%. Under the exploitation of the ruling clique in Hyderabad, the overwhelming majority of residents, including Andhras, Marathis, and Shannalis, have been reduced to landless peasants deprived of their civil rights and oppressed.\n\n　　The Andhras live in the Telingana region of Hyderabad, where the fate of the peasants is particularly tragic. The peasant uprising broke out in the second half of 1946 and later spread to most of the region. As a result of the uprising, over two thousand villages with a total population of about five million have been liberated from the old rule. People's committees, courts, and defense squads have been established in the liberated villages, and the landlords' property has been distributed to landless peasants and agricultural workers. In Adagol, Nalgonda district alone, about 10,000 acres of land have been distributed. The reactionary government's troops surrounded this \"rebellious\" area, burned down more than 7,000 peasant houses, and tortured more than 20,000 peasants, but the \"rebels\" still maintain an unyielding position and continue to resist the 10,000-strong government army. The uprising in Telingana has affected other ethnic groups in Hyderabad, prompting them to engage in resolute struggles against oppression.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 31st - According to merchants who recently arrived in Luoyang from Zhengzhou, after the brief liberation of Kaifeng, the defending enemy in Zhengzhou was terrified by the power of the People's Liberation Army and was extremely panicked. All the civilian houses in large and small villages within five miles of the city have been demolished by the enemy in the name of \"clearing the field of fire.\" Recently, they also planned to forcibly conscript laborers to build a small airport in the city. Because their grain-grabbing troops were constantly being annihilated and captured by the People's Liberation Army, the defending enemy was confined to the city and its suburbs. Grain was extremely scarce, and from late July, they had already begun to use the month's worth of grain that was intended to be used last. Therefore, the morale of the army was even more panicked.\n\nCitizens entering and leaving the city gates were strictly inspected. A curfew was imposed very early every night, and household registration checks at midnight were commonplace. During the checks, military police and secret agents took the opportunity to extort money. Many citizens were arrested on so-called \"political suspicion,\" and the detention centers were overcrowded. Under heavy exploitation and apportionment, most citizens were unable to make a living and left the city one after another. The population of Zhengzhou has sharply decreased from 350,000 in the first half of last year to about 230,000 at present. Ordinary citizens and merchants in Zhengzhou, after hearing from people coming from Kaifeng about the strict implementation of mass discipline and the policy of protecting urban industry and commerce by the People's Liberation Army, expressed their fervent hope for the early arrival of the People's Liberation Army in conversations with friends and acquaintances.\n\nAccording to student Qin, who recently arrived in Luoyang from Zhengzhou, after the brief liberation of Kaifeng, the middle class people gained a lot of understanding of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and the number of Zhengzhou students coming to the liberated areas gradually increased. The Kuomintang then adopted high-handed measures, closely checking students leaving the city and arbitrarily detaining them. After the summer vacation, they even forcibly arrested students on the outskirts of the city to serve as soldiers. At the same time, they established fascist-style summer camps, ordering schools to use administrative pressure to force students, especially those on public funding, to participate. A large number of secret agents were also sent out to collude with the Three Youth League to carry out enticement and intimidation, and used starvation tactics to threaten students. The meager 32 jin of food rice per student per month was not fully distributed. Prices have risen four or five times, but the vegetable money is still issued according to the April standard of 1.2 million \"legal tender,\" attempting to force students to enter the camp, but the students would rather endure hunger than go. Qin said: \"Two meals of porridge are like water, and the vegetables are gone in one bite. We haven't seen a drop of oil in more than a month, and our stomachs are rumbling with hunger. Our hair is two or three inches long and we don't have money to get it cut, but the students have never yielded.\" Taking his middle school as an example, out of more than 200 students in the school, only 15 were forced to participate in the summer camp.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 商人学生谈郑州见闻\n\n1948-09-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　商人学生谈郑州见闻\n    【新华社中原三十一日电】据新由郑州抵洛阳的商人谈，自开封一度解放后，郑州守敌慑于人民解放军声威，慌乱异常。城外五里以内大小村庄的民房，已被敌军以“扫清射界”为名一概拆平，最近还拟强征民夫，在城内修筑小型飞机场。由于其抢粮部队人员时受解放军歼俘，守敌局促于城内及市郊，粮食极为困难，自七月下旬起，已开始动用准备最后才用的一个月存粮，因此军心更为恐慌。\n    市民出入城门均被严格检查。每晚很早就实行戒严，午夜检查户口更是常事。在检查中，军警特务乘机敲诈勒索，市民以所谓“政治嫌疑”被捕者很多，看守所已有人满之患。在繁重榨取摊派下，市民大都无法生活，纷纷离城。郑州人口已从去年上半年的三十五万，锐减至目前二十三万左右。郑州一般市民及商人，从开封来人口中听到解放军严格执行群众纪律及保护城市工商业政策后，在知己朋友的谈话中，都热望解放军早日到来。\n    另据近由郑州抵洛阳的学生秦某谈称：开封一度解放后，中阶层人民对中共政策有了许多了解，郑州学生来解放区的日渐众多。国民党乃采取高压手段，严密盘查出城学生，任意加以扣押。暑假以后，更在城郊拦路强抓学生当兵。同时设立法西斯式的夏令营，命令各校以行政压力强迫学生特别是公费生参加。又派出大批特务结合三青团进行引诱、恐吓，并用饥饿政策威胁学生，每月每生为数甚微的三十二市斤食米，也不发齐。物价上涨了四、五倍，菜金仍按四月份标准“法币”一百廿万元发给，企图迫使学生入营，但是学生们宁愿忍受饥饿也不去。秦某说：“两顿稀饭象水一样，菜一口就光了，一个多月没有见到一点油，肚子饿的咕咕叫，头发两三寸长没钱理，但是同学们始终没有屈服。”以他所在的某中学为例，全校二百多学生，被迫参加夏令营的仅十五人。"

    "content": "Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict Convenes Armed Conference\n\tOrganizes Autumn Harvest Defense Struggle in Northern Henan\n\t[Taihang Electric] The Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict Military Commission convened a joint meeting of county military commission directors at the beginning of the month to discuss strengthening the construction of the people's armed forces and prepare for the autumn harvest defense struggle. The meeting first reviewed the armed work of the first half of the year, finding that the composition of the militia was basically pure, the relationship with the masses was closer than before, and the previous undisciplined and bad work style had been basically overcome. After a short-term training of more than 1,700 border area armed cadres, militia, and demolition experts in late April, the awareness of the people's armed forces was generally improved, the will to fight was firm, and the phenomenon of desertion was eliminated. The meeting focused on studying and determining the tasks of the people's armed forces construction before and after the autumn harvest. In terms of organizational construction: conduct immediate scientific and rational rectification, distinguish between general militia and expeditionary militia, reorganize them, and perform their respective duties. The meeting pointed out that due to certain \"left-leaning\" and adventurous deviations this spring, the number of militia has been greatly reduced. Now, special efforts should be made to strengthen the work of restoring and consolidating the militia. A large number of armed cadres should be trained and cultivated, and each county should conduct a collective training of key village cadres before the autumn harvest, mainly to clarify their thinking; the sub-district military commission is preparing to train district cadres once and cultivate a group of district-level reserve cadres. The meeting studied the sources of ideological confusion among the militia: (1) A small number of militia members do not understand current affairs and policies, and have shaken and pessimistic sentiments, feeling that there is no future. (2) Conflicts with family interests, excessive work delays, inability to produce well, and no work points for participating in the war. (3) Leading cadres do not care for the militia, issue administrative orders, have a purely utilitarian viewpoint, and fight adventurous battles. Based on the above situation, it was determined that in the future it is necessary to strengthen current affairs and policy education, strengthen organization and discipline, and establish a set of political life systems. At the same time, it is necessary to solve the militia's production problems and resolutely implement the system of work points for participating in the war; the best way is to earnestly implement the combination of labor and military affairs. Finally, the meeting studied tactical issues and decided to thoroughly change the two tactics of right-leaning retreat and defense and head-on confrontation. We must promote landmine explosions and outsmarting the enemy. In order to carry out the \"ten thousand landmine explosion\" campaign during the autumn harvest defense, each county must send personnel to be specifically responsible for training demolition experts, dividing minefields, and changing the passive burying of defensive mines to actively burying offensive mines in front, while combining with combat activities and turning \"dead mines\" into \"live mines.\" Combine with the interests of the masses, and do not damage the crops of the masses. Each county should hold small-scale explosion research conferences to exchange experience and improve technology.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行四分区召开武装会议　组织豫北保秋斗争\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行四分区召开武装会议\n  　组织豫北保秋斗争\n    【太行电】太行四分区武委会于月初召开县武委会主任联席会议，讨论加强人民武装建设，迎接保秋斗争。会议首先检查了前半年的武装工作，发现民兵成份基本上是纯洁的，与群众关系较前密切，基本上克服了过去无纪律的恶劣作风。四月下旬短期训练了一千七百余边地武装干部、民兵、爆炸手等后，人民武装的觉悟普遍提高，斗争意志坚定，根绝了逃亡现象。会议着重研究与确定了保秋前后人民武装建设的任务。在组织建设上：立即进行科学合理的整顿，分别一般民兵与远征民兵两种，重新编制，各司其职。会议指出：由于今春犯了某些左倾冒险的偏向，民兵数量大减。现应特别加强恢复与巩固民兵的工作。大批训练与培养武装干部，各县保秋前要将主要村干集训一次，主要是澄清思想；分区武委会准备将区干训练一次，并培养一批区级预备干部。会议研究了民兵思想混乱的来源：（一）少数民兵对时事和政策不了解，发生动摇悲观情绪，觉得无前途。（二）与家庭利益矛盾，误工特别多，不能好好生产，参战又不顶工。（三）领导干部不爱护民兵，行政命令，单纯使用观点，打冒险的仗。根据上述情况，确定今后必须加强时事政策教育，加强组织性纪律性，建立一套政治生活制度。同时必须解决民兵生产问题，坚决执行参战顶工制；最好的办法是认真实行劳武结合。最后研究战术问题，会议决定要彻底转变右倾退缩防守与牛抵角硬顶硬的两种战术。要发扬地雷爆炸与斗智。为了开展保秋中的万雷爆炸运动，每县必须派人专门负责训练爆炸手，划分雷区，把消极的埋防御雷改变为积极到前边埋进攻雷，同时与战斗活动结合，变死雷为活雷。与群众利益结合，不能损害群众庄稼。各县应开小型爆炸研究会，交流经验提高技术。"

    "content": "Taihang Xinhua Daily editorial calls for\n\tImmediately organize border area autumn harvest protection\n[Taihang Electric] As the autumn harvest approaches, the Taihang Xinhua Daily, based on the current characteristics of the struggle against the enemy in the Yubei border area and the experience of wheat protection struggles, published an editorial calling for \"immediate organization to protect the autumn harvest.\" It pointed out: (1) This year's wheat protection struggle began under relatively difficult and passive conditions, but thanks to our implementation of correct struggle principles and deployments, and the heroic struggle of the Party, government, army, and people, especially the armed forces and militia, the task of protecting the wheat harvest was successfully completed. Through the wheat harvest struggle, the phenomenon of no-man's-lands and the opposition between red and white areas was eliminated in our border areas. The positions for fighting the enemy and the people's ability to defend themselves have been greatly strengthened compared to before. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, after our powerful military and political blows, has become even more shaken and weakened, which has changed our previous passive situation and formed the current favorable situation for the autumn harvest protection struggle. Therefore, when deploying the autumn harvest protection struggle in the border areas, we should base ourselves on this favorable condition, on the one hand, to further strengthen the mass guerrilla warfare in the border areas, give full play to the excellent tradition of combining labor and military affairs, and rush to harvest, rush to cultivate, and rush to plant; on the other hand, we must more actively and aggressively attack the enemy, penetrate deep into the enemy's rear, and destroy the enemy's conspiracy to seize grain, putting the enemy in a passive position, so that we can more effectively protect the autumn harvest in the border areas. (2) In the wheat harvest struggle, the disintegration of the enemy and the elimination of the opposition between red and white areas and no-man's-lands yielded quick results. The most important reason for this was the launch of the political offensive. Therefore, in the autumn harvest protection struggle, we should continue to exert the power of the political offensive. We should, based on the two-year summary of the Liberation War, and in connection with the situation in our region, publicize victory, disintegrate the enemy, and organize the people in the Chiang-occupied areas to resist grain and resist taxes, exposing the enemy's conspiracy to divide the masses. We should educate the people in the Chiang-occupied areas not to fall for the enemy's tricks, and to cooperate with each other to deal with the enemy. (3) The basic reason why the political offensive exerted great power in the wheat harvest struggle is that our border areas have straightened out their policies. Therefore, in the autumn harvest protection struggle, we must continue to implement the correction of deviations and the straightening of policies step by step, in order to consolidate the anti-Chiang united front and further mobilize the masses. (4) After the autumn harvest, wheat will be planted soon. Our slogans are: defend the autumn harvest, defend wheat planting, and defend the able-bodied men. Harvest quickly, fight quickly, hide quickly, plant quickly; harvest while fighting, hide while fighting, plant while fighting; use the fields as threshing grounds and hide the harvest as you go. (5) It is necessary to hold good cadre meetings, to make necessary rectification and training of the divisional troops, county cadre teams, district cadre teams, and militia, to unify thinking and unify deployment, and to make full preparations for weapons such as landmines and ammunition, and to strengthen the command and intelligence work at all levels. The editorial said: The wheat harvest struggle was victorious, and we are also confident of achieving victory in the autumn harvest protection struggle. But we must not be blinded by victory. All ideas of arrogance and paralysis are dangerous.\n    The editorial pointed out: The autumn harvest in the hinterland and the wheat planting on fallow land will also be a series of relatively intense tasks, and we should also seize the leadership and organize the masses to harvest and thresh quickly, and strive for time to plant wheat on fallow land. Some areas will inevitably have to complete certain war service tasks at the same time. Therefore, we should continue to rectify and organize mutual aid teams, give full play to the role of organizational mutual aid, and mobilize the vast number of women laborers and all semi-auxiliary laborers to participate in harvesting and threshing, in order to gain time to prepare the wheat fields. This year's wheat planting should generally maintain the past level as a standard, and all cultivated land should be strived to be fully prepared. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, attention should be paid to seed selection and seed disinfection to avoid insect plagues and increase next year's harvest. At the same time, it should be publicized that whoever sows reaps, and timely sowing should be guaranteed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行新华日报社论号召　立即组织边地保秋\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行新华日报社论号召\n  　立即组织边地保秋\n    【太行电】秋收即将到来，太行新华日报特根据目前豫北边地对敌斗争的特点及护麦斗争的经验发表社论，号召“立即组织保卫秋收”。指出：（一）今年护麦斗争是在比较困难与被动的条件下开始的，但由于我们执行了正确的斗争方针与部署，党政军民特别是武装部队和民兵英勇奋斗，使保卫麦收的任务胜利完成。经过麦收斗争，我边沿地区消灭了无人区与赤白对立的现象。对敌斗争的阵地及群众自卫的能力比以前大为坚强了。而蒋匪军经过我有力的军事与政治的打击，更加动摇，更加削弱了，这就改变了我们以前的被动形势，形成了现在保秋斗争的有利形势。因此边地在部署保秋斗争时，应当依据这一有利的条件，一方面进一步加强边地群众性的游击战争，发挥劳武结合的优良传统，抢收、抢耕、抢种；一方面要更主动更积极的向敌人进攻，深入敌人后方，破坏敌人的抢粮阴谋，陷敌于被动，而使我更有力的保卫边地秋收。（二）在麦收斗争中瓦解敌人，消灭赤白对立与无人区，收效很快，其中最重要的原因，就是政治攻势的开展。因此保秋斗争中仍应继续发挥政治攻势的威力。应根据解放战争两年总结，连系本区形势，宣传胜利，瓦解敌人，并组织蒋占区人民抗粮抗款斗争，揭露敌人分裂群众的阴谋。应教育蒋区人民不要中敌诡计，要互相配合应付敌人。（三）麦收斗争中政治攻势发挥巨大力量的基本原因，在于我边沿区端正了政策。因此在保秋斗争中必须继续有步骤的贯彻纠偏、端正政策，以巩固反蒋统一战线，并进一步发动群众。（四）秋收后很快种麦，我们的口号是保卫秋收，保卫种麦，保卫壮丁。快收、快打、快藏、快种，边收、边打、边藏、边种，就地晒场，随打随藏。（五）必须开好干部会议，对分区部队、县干队、区干队及民兵作必要的整顿训练，统一思想统一布置，并作充分的地雷弹药等武器准备，加强各级指挥部与情报工作。社论称：麦收斗争是胜利了，我们也有把握取得保秋斗争的胜利。但不能因胜利冲昏头脑，一切骄傲、麻痹的思想都是危险的。\n    社论指出：腹地的秋收与垡地种麦，也将是一连串的比较紧张的工作，亦应抓紧领导，组织群众快收快打，争取时间垡地种麦。若干地区必然也要同时完成一定的战勤任务。因此应继续整顿与组织互助组，尽量发挥组织互助的作用，发动广大妇女劳力及所有半辅劳力参加收割打场，以便争取时间垡好麦地。今年种麦一般以保持过去的水平为准，所有耕地应争取全部垡好。秋收种麦时应注意选种及种子消毒，以避免虫灾，增加来年收成。同时应宣传谁种谁收，保证及时下种。"

In the seven districts, one hundred and six natural villages... twenty-five villages have already eliminated 6,880 cartloads of locusts, and the entire district will be able to completely eliminate them in another three days.\"\n\nWhat I question is that twenty-five villages have eliminated 6,880 cartloads. It doesn't specify how many people were mobilized in these twenty-five villages? How many days did they catch locusts? Also, what kind of carts were they? Were they carts pushed by people or pulled by animals? How much did each cart weigh? Was the number of carts estimated, or were they all actually weighed and pulled? If they were all actually weighed and pulled, with nearly 7,000 cartloads, even without calculating the locust-catching time, just loading and unloading these 6,000-plus cartloads would take a considerable amount of time. Of course, I certainly don't deny the power of the masses. Please provide further explanation from the reporter.\n\nSecondly: In the July 12th issue, on the first page, there was a news item titled \"Cadres in Guangling and Yanggao Counties Practice Economy to Provide Disaster Relief,\" followed by a section on the spread of infectious diseases in the third and sixth districts of Wanxian County, which stated: \"Recently, in the Dayuhuang and Ningjiazhuang areas of the first district of the county... 'Cow lice' have appeared on cotton and bean plants in some villages in the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Free Greece Radio recently broadcast a communique from the Greek Democratic Army stating: The first stage of the major battle in the northern Pindus Mountains has concluded. From June 14th to August 21st, the Greek Democratic Army, with unparalleled heroism, defended the positions in the Boron-Solikas and Grammos regions, successfully executing the Supreme Command's operational plan and victoriously annihilating the enemy's elite troops. It is estimated that a total of 22,800 officers and soldiers of the Royalist Fascist army were killed, wounded, or captured, 35 enemy aircraft were shot down, 18 enemy tanks and 5 field guns were destroyed, and countless spoils of war were seized. The Supreme Command of the Democratic Army sent a telegram to the Democratic Army in the area congratulating them on their great victory, pointing out that the result of this victory has shattered all the plans of the Royalist Fascist army headquarters to eliminate the Democratic Army in this campaign. The Democratic Army in the Epirus, Roumeli, Hesia, Trikala, and Kalambaka regions completed significant offensive operations in coordination with the actions of the Democratic Army in the northern Pindus Mountains. Currently, the main force of the Democratic Army in the northern Pindus Mountains broke through the enemy's lines on the evening of August 21st and is advancing east and southeast.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Simultaneously with the Greek Democratic Army in the Grammos Mountains in the northern Pindus Mountains annihilating over 20,000 enemy troops and victoriously breaking through the enemy's defense lines to engage in outside operations, the Democratic Army throughout Greece launched widespread offensives. According to a report from the Electric News Agency on the 25th: \"The Democratic Army continues to conduct victorious offensive operations in various regions. Important transportation lines and power stations in several provinces have been controlled or destroyed by the Democratic Army. These new offensives by the Democratic Army have forced the Athens government to conscript another 30,000 men into the army at the behest of the Americans.\" Previously, during the major battle in the Grammos Mountains, because half of the Greek Royalist Fascist army was tied down in that mountainous area, it created favorable conditions for the Democratic Army to launch widespread attacks in other regions. Now these attacks are seriously threatening the US-Greek reactionaries. Even a United Press reporter admitted in a report on the 24th: \"Guerrilla warfare has reached an unprecedentedly bad level.\" The Democratic Army \"shells provincial capitals, ambushes transport convoys, lays landmines on roads, and destroys reservoirs.\" In the Larissa, Trikala, and Karditsa regions northwest of Athens, \"the gendarmerie can no longer control the situation there.

The instructions stated: Recently, the special commissioner's offices and county (city) governments have made improvements in reflecting the situation and reporting work. However, in general, the reports are not timely or frequent enough; some counties have not yet recognized that reporting the situation and work to higher levels is a regular responsibility that should be fulfilled. They only occasionally think of it, do it once in a while, or are forced to do it only when a serious situation has been exposed and adverse consequences have arisen. These are serious manifestations of indiscipline or a state of anarchy.\n\nThe instructions pointed out the following shortcomings in existing reports: (1) The situation is not comprehensive, with only isolated phenomena, failing to show the general situation, or only vague overviews, failing to show vivid facts, making it impossible to judge whether the effect is good or bad. (2) The problems are not clear. For the shortcomings, errors, and problems discovered, there is only a general description, with little effort to get to the bottom of things, clarify right and wrong responsibilities, analyze the causes and consequences, and propose practical and reasonable solutions. (3) The plans are not specific. Some plans lack connection with the work that has already been done, becoming an isolated set of history; some have many problems, no central focus, no visible allocation of forces, and no implementation methods. As a result, many reports are lengthy and verbose, but fail to explain the problem.\n\nBased on the above shortcomings, the instructions newly stipulate the following work reporting methods:\n\nA. If any new and important problems occur or are discovered by special commissioner's offices or county governments, they should immediately telegraph or send a letter to the government.\n\nB. Every two months, the commissioner and county chief must personally write a report to the chairman, focusing on the basic experiences and policy implementation in this period of work, pointing out the problems and deviations that have occurred, explaining the crux of the problem, the leadership's understanding of it, and the solutions, rather than a flat narrative of the process. Each report should focus on several important issues at the time and place, and suggestions for the work of the border region and opinions on the higher levels, rather than writing about everything regardless of priority. The materials must be carefully considered and analyzed, specifically explaining the problems. This system will be implemented uniformly starting in September.\n\nC. At the end of each piece of work, a more comprehensive summary report should be made. This report must be written after detailed discussion. The content of the report should not only include vivid and concrete real situations, but also write about the problems encountered in the work process, the handling methods, and the main experiences and lessons learned, striving to be concise and avoid being empty and lengthy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 怎样写工作报告？　陕甘宁边府指示：要及时经常全面明确\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　怎样写工作报告？\n  　陕甘宁边府指示：要及时经常全面明确\n    【新华社西北三十一日电】陕甘宁边区政府于八月十七日指示各专员、县（市）长，规定工作报告制度，以便及时掌握真实情况，正确指导政策之执行。指示中称：近来各专署、县（市）在反映情况及报告工作方面，已有改进。但一般说，报告尚不及时，也不经常；部分县则迄未认识向上级反映情况与报告工作为应尽的经常的责任，仅仅偶然想到，偶一为之，或在严重情况已暴露，恶果已产生的情况下被迫为之，这都是严重的无纪律或无政府状态的表现。\n    指示指出现有的报告尚存在如下缺点：（一）情况不全面，或仅有孤立现象，看不出一般情况，或仅有模糊概况，看不到生动事实，效果究属好坏，无法判断。（二）问题不明确，对发现的缺点、错误、问题，只有笼统的叙述，少追根究底、弄清是非责任、分析前因后果、提出确实的合理解决办法。（三）计划不具体，有的计划与已做的工作缺乏联系，成为割断历史的孤立一套；有的问题很多，没有中心，看不到力量配备，也看不到实施方法，因之很多报告长篇大论，却未能说明问题。\n    根据以上缺点该指示从新规定工作报告办法如下：\n    甲、各专署、各县政府临时发生或发现新的重要问题，应随时立即电告或函告本府。\n    乙、专员、县长每两个月须亲自给主席写书面报告一次，着重于这一时期工作中的基本经验及政策的执行，指出所发生的问题和偏向，说明症结所在，领导上对此的认识及解决的办法，而不是平铺直叙讲过程。每次报告应着重写当时当地的几个重要问题，及对边区工作的建议和对上级的意见，而不是不分主次，样样都写。材料必须经过酝酿和分析，具体的说明问题。这一制度，一律于九月份开始实行。\n    丙、每件工作终了时，应作较全面的总结报告。此种报告须经详细讨论后写出。报告内容不仅有生动具体的真实情况，并且应将工作过程中所发生的问题和处理办法及主要经验教训写出，力求简明扼要，切忌空洞冗长。"

    "content": "[Hebei Central Electric]\n\n　　Disconnection Between Disaster Relief and Production\n　　Renqiu County Committee Conducts Inspection and Correction\n\n　　[Hebei Central Electric] The Renqiu County Committee discussed and decided on the production and disaster relief work for villages affected by the floods on July 31st. On August 3rd, the director of the Promotion Cooperative led ten cadres to the disaster areas to coordinate with local cadres in leading production and disaster relief. After twelve days of work, they initially understood the local people's production base and production habits, distributed 1,200 catties of loan grain, and 6.1 million yuan in loans. They organized 34 production groups for fishing, windlassing, purchasing livestock, spinning thread, transportation and sales, carpentry, carting, weaving cloth, and weaving mats, and also motivated a lot of private capital. Through the promotion of \"frugality to survive the famine,\" they gradually changed the masses' idea of not being thrifty.\n\n　　The achievements of Renqiu's disaster relief work are certain, but at the same time, some serious deviations have occurred: (1) The Promotion Cooperative's policy on production and disaster relief was vague. Instead of solving the actual difficulties of the masses through organizing mass production, it wanted to simply provide disaster relief with loans. At the same time, it decided to sell the village's surplus property to solve the problem of insufficient loans. In the five key villages for production and disaster relief in the Eleventh District, the surplus property had all been sold. In Yuanguo Village in the Twelfth District, the farmers were unwilling to sell their surplus property, but the cadres leading production and disaster relief in the village insisted on selling it. (It is wrong to force the masses to sell their surplus property when they are unwilling to do so. This is not good for production and will also alienate oneself from the masses, and should be immediately inspected and corrected—Editor). The comrades leading production and disaster relief in Yuanguo Village did not thoroughly understand the situation, did not conduct a good survey of the needs of the masses, and only listened to the village cadres saying that they needed 6 million yuan, so they asked the Promotion Cooperative for 6 million yuan. (2) In the loan process, the stages of propaganda, organization, and loan issuance were mechanically separated, which was troublesome and time-consuming, and the masses were very annoyed. The chairman of the poor peasant league and four others in Baiyang Village had already organized a windlass group. When they went to the Promotion Cooperative to discuss loans, Secretary Li said: \"Go back first, see how many groups your village organizes, how much money you need, and then borrow it all together.\" The chairman of the poor peasant league accepted the spirit of \"more groups organized, more money borrowed,\" and that night held a mass meeting, talking about \"free association to borrow money,\" and suddenly organized 29 groups. Comrade Cheng, who led the production and disaster relief in the village, believed that he had completed the task, and then returned to the office to get the money. (3) The cadres leading production and disaster relief were not thorough in their work. Comrades Cheng and Wang, who worked in Baiyang Village, understood the situation for twelve days, but could not even figure out the numbers. (4) Some districts still neglected production and disaster relief: There were eight villages in the Twelfth District that were completely flooded, but the main cadres of the district did not participate in the leadership of production and disaster relief. When Comrade Gao of the Promotion Cooperative approached the district committee to study production and disaster relief work, the district committee secretary said: \"No matter what, you can figure it out.\" After the Second District arranged production and disaster relief work, they did not organize a single group in twelve days, and only took care of cleaning up surplus property, putting production and disaster relief aside.\n\n　　In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the county committee held another meeting on the 15th of this month to study and re-clarify the policy of production and disaster relief, correcting the purely disaster relief viewpoint. It was proposed: (1) To correctly recognize that disaster relief work is an extremely complex and meticulous work, cadres must have a strong mass viewpoint, go deep into each household, specifically understand the disaster situation and production situation, and provide loans according to the urgent needs of the masses, and organize mass production. When issuing loans, propaganda should be carried out along with organization and loan issuance at any time, correcting the erroneous method of mechanically separating stages and simply emphasizing organization before loans are issued. (2) To change the purely relief viewpoint of cadres and the masses, implement the spirit of production, thrift, and self-reliance, and enable loans to truly play a role in assisting mass production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 救灾与生产脱节　任邱县委检查纠正\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　救灾与生产脱节\n  　任邱县委检查纠正\n    【冀中电】任邱县委在七月三十一日讨论决定了遭水灾村庄的生产救灾工作，八月三日，推进社主任带着十个干部分赴灾区，协同当地区干领导生产救灾。经过十二天的工夫，初步了解了当地群众生产基础和生产习惯，发放了一千二百斤贷粮，六十一万元贷款。组织起捕鱼、风弓、购买牲口、纺线、运销、木匠、大车、织布、织席等三十四个生产组，还带动了很多私资。经过宣传“节约渡荒”，逐步转变了群众不节约的思想。\n    任邱救灾工作有成绩是肯定的，但同时也发生了若干严重偏向：（一）推进社对生产救灾的方针是模糊的，不是从组织群众生产中解决群众的实际困难，却想单纯用贷款赈济灾民，同时确定变卖村里的浮财，解决贷款少的困难。十一区五个生产救灾的重点村，浮财都变卖了。十二区袁果庄农民不愿卖浮财，在该村领导生产救灾的干部非让卖不可。（群众不愿变卖浮财，你硬逼着人家卖，这是错误的。这样作对生产没有好处，还会使自己脱离了群众，应立即检查纠正——编者）在袁果庄领导生产救灾的同志，没有深入了解情况，没有很好的调查群众的需要，只听到村干说需要六百万元，他就向推进社要求六百万元。（二）贷款中机械的硬分开宣传、组织、贷款等阶段，又麻烦又费时间，群众很讨厌。白洋村贫农团主席等五个人早就组织了风弓组，到推进社商量贷款时，李秘书说：“你们先回去，看你村组织多少组，用多少款，再一块贷。”贫农团主席接受了“组织的组多贷的款多”的精神，当天晚上开了个群众大会，讲了讲“自由结组来贷款”，一下子就组织了二十九个组。领导该村生产救灾的程同志便认为完成了任务，接着就回机关取款。（三）领导生产救灾的干部工作上不深入，在白洋村工作的程、王两同志，了解了十二天情况，连个数字也弄不清。（四）有的区仍忽视生产救灾：十二区全部被淹的村有八个，但该区主要干部都没参加生产救灾的领导。推进社高同志找到区委研究生产救灾工作时，区委书记说：“不管怎么着，你们看着去弄去吧。”二区布置生产救灾工作后，十二天中连一个组也没组织，光顾清理浮财，把生产救灾放在一边。\n    为克服上述缺点，县委于本月十五日又开会作了研究，再次明确生产救灾的方针，纠正单纯救灾观点。提出：（一）正确认识救灾工作是极其复杂细致的工作，干部必须有坚强的群众观点，切实深入到户，具体了解灾情及生产情况，根据群众迫切需要进行贷款，组织群众生产。贷款时应随宣传随组织随时贷，纠正机械分开阶段和单纯强调组织起来才贷的错误方法。（二）转变干部和群众单纯赈济观点，贯彻生产节约自救的精神，使贷款真正起到扶助群众生产的作用。"

The formation of this new organization has been under discussion for a long time, and it will be called the League for the Defense of Democracy. It is expected to serve as a united center for workers, farmers, merchants, and small business owners to fight against intensifying reactionary activities. All democratic political parties and mass organizations will be invited to participate.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Tokyo News: JCP Secretary-General Tokuda Kyuichi granted an exclusive interview to a Domei News Agency reporter on the 25th, and issued a statement regarding the establishment of a Japanese People's Front. Tokuda emphasized: \"The current situation in Japan is favorable for the establishment of a broad People's Front representing workers, farmers, the middle class, and even small and medium-sized industrialists. This People's Front is the first goal of the Communist Party, and it will fight to defend national independence and democracy, civil rights, and the economic interests of the majority of the people.\" Based on the assassination attempt against him in July by reactionaries and the anti-strike actions, Tokuda profoundly analyzed the current situation in Japan, stating: \"The Japanese ruling class can no longer rule within the scope of bourgeois democracy and has adopted reactionary policies characterized by force and violence. The government's action of using MacArthur's letter to Ashida to deprive 2.5 million government employees of the right to collective bargaining and strike is the first step in a general offensive against the organization of the working class. The government is pinning its hopes on obtaining American capital. The situation of Japanese capitalism is so desperate that it cannot rule for long without foreign capital.\" Tokuda declared: The Communist Party will participate in organizing a national committee system representing various groups (political parties, trade unions, farmer associations, and other organizations) whose interests depend on freedom and national independence. In analyzing the favorable conditions for establishing a People's Front, Tokuda particularly emphasized the living conditions of Japanese workers and farmers, saying: Japanese workers today earn only about half of their living expenses, and the threat of unemployment hangs over their heads. Due to the government's increased grain collection and low official grain prices, poor and middle peasants are experiencing great difficulties. The serious shortage of agricultural capital can be illustrated by the fact that farmers' savings have decreased from 35 billion yen to 10 billion yen last year. A large number of small industrial enterprises are in danger of bankruptcy or being annexed by monopoly capital, and they have recently formed their own organizations to fight for survival.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 日共及工农领袖等集会东京　决定组织民主阵线　德田发表谈话指出人民有利条件\n\n1948-09-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　日共及工农领袖等集会东京\n  　决定组织民主阵线\n  　德田发表谈话指出人民有利条件\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】据电通社东京二十七日消息：日本共产党及左翼社会党议员与工会及农会领袖们在东京举行会议，决定组成一个民主民族阵线的新组织。这个新组织的组成已经讨论了很久，它将称为保卫民主同盟，预料将作为工人、农民、商人和小企业家对加厉中的反动活动进行斗争的团结中心。一切民主政党和群众团体均将被邀请参加。\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】东京消息：日共总书记德田球一于二十五日单独接见电通社记者，发表关于建立日本人民阵线的谈话。德田着重指出：“目前日本情势，有利于建立代表工人、农民、中产阶级，甚至中小工业家的广泛的人民阵线。这一人民阵线是共产党的第一个目标，它将为保卫国家独立民主、公民权利以及大多数人民的经济利益而战斗”。德田根据七月间反动派对他的行刺和反罢工的行为，深刻地分析目前日本情势称：“日本统治阶级已再不能在资产阶级民主的范围内进行统治，而采取了以武力及暴力为其特征的反动政策。政府利用麦克阿瑟致芦田的信，剥夺二百五十万政府职工集体议价与罢工权利的行动，是对工人阶级的组织实行总进攻的第一步。政府正将其希望寄托于获得美国资本。日本资本主义的处境是如此绝望，以致没有外国资本就不能统治多久了”。德田宣称：共产党将参与组织代表各团体（政党、职工会、农会及其他组织）的全国性的委员会系统，这些团体的利益依赖于自由及国家独立。德田在分析建立人民阵线的有利条件时，特别重视日本工农的生活状况，他说：日本工人今天所得工资仅约达生活费用的半数，失业的威胁悬在他们的头顶上。由于政府增加粮食征收和粮食官价过低，贫农与中农正经历着巨大的困难。农业资本的严重短缺，可以拿农民的储蓄在去年中由三百五十亿日元降低到一百亿日元一事来说明。大量的小工业企业都处在破产或被独占资本并吞的危险之中，他们最近组成了他们自己的组织，来进行求生存的奋斗。"

He is currently 54 years old, born in 1894 in Nago Town, Okinawa Prefecture. During his student days, he studied Marxism and participated in the labor movement. In 1921, Tokuda and other comrades began preparations to establish the Japanese Communist Party. In November 1922, the JCP was officially founded, and he led it in struggle. In June 1923, the JCP was suppressed. Tokuda maintained contact between the Party and the working class in a secret environment. After three and a half years of effort, he restored the Party. Tokuda was also the founder of the left-wing trade union, highly respected by Japanese workers, who affectionately called him \"Tokkyu.\" In 1928, the JCP was suppressed again, and Tokuda was arrested and imprisoned. He maintained the integrity of a Communist in prison for 18 years, continuing the struggle against the enemy heroically and unyieldingly until he was released after Japan's surrender in 1945. In December of the same year, Tokuda led the Fourth Party Congress, which was of great significance in the history of the JCP, and determined the general line of the JCP in the new situation. During the general election last April, he was elected as a member of parliament with more than 70,000 votes as a candidate in Tokyo's Second District.

We have all testified about this matter in the district, and the actual situation is that Ma Shuangzhen has three daughters and a son who did not want their mother to marry someone else.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editorial\n\n　　When determining the class status of landlords and rich peasants,\n  　What standards should be used for calculating the years and amount of exploitation?\n    Question: We have encountered two problems in reviewing class status that we cannot resolve. One is the number of years of exploitation by landlords and rich peasants, and the other is the amount of exploitation by rich peasants. Regarding the former, the 1933 document stipulated that the calculation should start from the establishment of the revolutionary regime, counting backward. Anyone who continuously lived as a landlord or rich peasant for three years would be classified as a landlord or rich peasant. However, Comrade Ren Bishi's report stipulated that in the old liberated areas, landlords who had engaged in labor for five consecutive years after the establishment of the democratic regime, and rich peasants who had not exploited others for three consecutive years, could change their class status. Regarding the latter, the 1933 document stipulated that \"those whose exploitation exceeds 15 percent of their family's total annual income are called rich peasants.\" However, Comrade Ren Bishi's report stipulated that their exploitation income must exceed 25 percent of their income to be considered rich peasants. Which document should be followed in the old liberated areas regarding the above two issues? Also, how should the amount of exploitation by rich peasants be specifically calculated? Should the food and wages of hired laborers be deducted from their total income?\n    Answer: Regarding the question of \"which document should be followed,\" when the Central Committee re-promulgated the two 1933 documents this year, it also issued the \"Decision on the Two 1933 Documents,\" which was printed in front of the two documents. It clearly pointed out: \"Issues not mentioned in these two documents, and issues concerning the division between rich peasants and middle peasants, should be based on other documents published by the Central Committee and Comrade Ren Bishi's speech 'Several Issues in Land Reform' made on January 12, 1948.\" The 1933 document, supplemented in this way, is the correct standard for classifying classes.\n    Regarding the number of years of exploitation. The 1933 decision stipulated that the calculation should start from the establishment of the revolutionary regime, counting backward for three consecutive years, as the time standard for classifying class status. This is the time standard for determining whether someone was a landlord or rich peasant at the time of the establishment of the revolutionary regime. Comrade Bishi's report stated that landlords who have worked for five years and rich peasants who have eliminated exploitation for three years under the democratic regime should change their class status. This is based on the 1933 decision. When the revolutionary regime was established, they were originally landlords and rich peasants, but under the democratic regime, due to the implementation of our party's policies such as reasonable burden, rent reduction, and interest reduction, or for other reasons, they have descended to the level of peasants. Those who have been landlords for five years and rich peasants for three years should have their class status changed. These two regulations are not contradictory. The 1933 decision stipulates the number of years for constituting class status, and Comrade Bishi's report stipulates the number of years for changing class status. The latter is a supplement to the former. Suppose the revolutionary regime was established in early 1938. If someone continuously lived as a landlord in 1935, 1936, and 1937, or their annual exploitation income exceeded 25 percent of their total income (the 15 percent stipulated in 1933 was changed to 25 percent according to Comrade Bishi's report), then this person has constituted landlord or rich peasant status. However, if this person has been engaged in labor himself and no longer exploited others for five years since 1938, regardless of when he started, he should be changed from a landlord to a peasant. Or, if this person was originally an old-style rich peasant, if he has eliminated his exploitation for three years, he should be changed from a rich peasant to a peasant.\n    Regarding the amount of exploitation. The boundary between rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants should be uniformly determined according to Comrade Bishi's report, using 25 percent as the dividing line. As for the calculation method of the amount of exploitation by farmers who hire farm laborers, it is to deduct wages and food (no other deductions) from the products of the hired laborers, and see if the surplus exceeds 25 percent of the employer's total income. If it exceeds, it is a rich peasant; if it does not exceed (or is exactly equal to), it is a well-to-do middle peasant. Suppose a farmer works himself and also hires people to work, and his total annual income is 100 shi. Suppose the hired laborer's products are 60 shi, and the hired laborer's wages and food amount to 30 shi. Subtracting 30 shi from 60 shi leaves 30 shi, which exceeds 25 percent of his total income of 100 shi. This farmer should be classified as a rich peasant. In the above example, if the total income is 100 shi, if the hired laborer's products are 50 shi, and the hired laborer's wages and food amount to 25 shi or more than 25 shi. Subtracting 25 shi or more than 25 shi from 50 shi leaves 25 shi or less than 25 shi, which only accounts for 25 percent or less of his total income of 100 shi. This farmer should be classified as a well-to-do middle peasant.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 确定地主、富农成份时　计算剥削年限与剥削分量究以什么为标准？\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社社论\n\n　　确定地主、富农成份时\n  　计算剥削年限与剥削分量究以什么为标准？\n    问：我们在审订成份中，遇到两个问题不能解决，一个是地主、富农的剥削年限问题，一个是富农的剥削分量问题。关于前一问题，一九三三年文件中规定以革命政权建立时为起点，向上推算，凡连续过地主、富农生活满三年者即构成地主、富农成份；而任弼时同志报告中则规定在老解放区内，民主政权建立后，地主劳动连续满五年、富农不剥削连续满三年者即可改变成份。关于后一问题，一九三三年文件中规定“其剥削分量超过其全家一年总收入的百分之十五者，叫做富农。”而任弼时同志报告中，则规定其剥削收入要超过其收入百分之廿五者才算富农。以上两个问题，在老解放区究应依从那个文件？又富农的剥削分量，怎样具体计算？是否应从其总收入中扣除雇工的伙食、工资？\n    答：关于“究应依从哪个文件”的问题，今年中央重新公布一九三三年两个文件时，并发表了“关于一九三三年的两个文件的决定”，印在两个文件前面，其中即曾明白指出：“这两个文件中没有讲到的问题及关于富农和中农分界的问题，则应以中央发表的其他文件及任弼时同志在一九四八年一月十二日所作‘土地改革中的几个问题’的讲演中所说者为准。”加上这样补充以后的一九三三年文件，就是划分阶级的正确标准。\n    关于剥削年限问题。一九三三年的决定，规定以革命政权成立时为起点，向上推算，连续三年做为划分阶级的时间标准，这是确定某人在革命政权成立时是否地主或富农成份的时间标准；弼时同志报告中说，在民主政权下地主劳动五年、富农取消剥削三年者改变其成份，这是根据三三年决定，当革命政权建立时，原是地主富农，但在民主政权上，由于我党历年来合理负担、减租减息等政策之执行或其他原因而下降为农民，地主满五年，富农满三年者，即应改变其成份。这两个规定并无矛盾，三三年决定规定的为构成成份的年限，弼时同志报告中规定的是改变成份的年限，后者正是前者的补充。假定革命政权成立于一九三八年初，某人在一九三五、三六、三七三年，连续过地主生活或每年的剥削收入均超过其总收入百分之二十五（三三年规定的百分之十五，照弼时同志报告改为二十五），则此人已构成地主或富农成份；但如此人自一九三八年以后，无论从何年起自己从事劳动，不再剥削别人已满五年者，即应由地主改为农民，或此人原为旧式富农，如取消其剥削已满三年者，即应由富农改为农民。\n    关于剥削分量问题。应一律依照弼时同志的报告，以百分之廿五为富农与富裕中农的界限。至于对雇用雇农的农民之剥削分量的计算方法，则是从雇农的生产物中扣除工资和食粮（其余不扣），看其盈余是否超过此雇主的总收入的百分之二十五，如超过则为富农，不超过（或刚好等于）则为富裕中农。假定某农民自己劳动，也雇人劳动，全年总收入是一百石，假定雇农的生产物是六十石，雇农的工资、伙食合三十石，从六十石中减去三十石，尚余三十石，超过其总收入一百石的百分之二十五，此农民应定为富农。如上例，总收入为一百石，若雇农生产物为五十石，雇农的工资、伙食合二十五石或比二十五石还多，从五十石中减去二十五石或二十五石多，尚余二十五石或不到二十五石，仅占其总收入一百石的百分之二十五或不足二十五，此农民应定为富裕中农。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社陕北三十一日电】"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Reports from various sources: The absurd uproar of the \"spy investigation\" manufactured by the House Un-American Activities Committee, controlled by the US Republican Party, has been miserably exposed. Since July 30, the committee, based on the fabrications of a neurotic female swindler, Bentley, who became an FBI agent before the war and claimed to be a \"Soviet spy,\" has successively summoned several officials from the Roosevelt administration and announced that it would separately summon people who support the Progressive Party, creating a \"spy terror\" on a large scale. According to Wallace, former Undersecretary of the Treasury White died on the 16th after being tortured by the committee after being summoned. Recently, the committee has fabricated ridiculous claims such as \"Truman hiding evidence of Soviet spies\" and Columbia University President Eisenhower \"accepting money from the Communist intelligence bureau.\" Because their fabrications are so absurd and shameless that many reactionary American newspapers have said that this is a propaganda effect, and even Truman, who once ordered the arrest of the American Communist leaders based on Bentley's slander, has, seeing that this \"investigation\" by the committee is not only aimed at attacking the progressive forces, but also at attacking him, had to declare again on the 19th that he disagreed with the congressional \"spy investigation\" and denounced it as a violation of human rights.\n\nAmerican Progressive Party presidential candidate Wallace recently pointed out in his radio address that the House Un-American Activities Committee represents the interests of international capitalists and arms dealers, whose profits increase or decrease entirely according to the degree of world crisis and white terror, and that they are the real huge threat that needs to be stopped. Four famous black leaders in the United States—singer Robeson, historian Du Bois, politician Howard, and \"Black Communications\" newspaper editor Dungee—and a group of famous writers, artists, and scientists issued a statement on the 23rd opposing the creation of hysteria and demanding the immediate cessation of the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings, pointing out that this is an \"attempt to strengthen the recent war propaganda and the general reactionary movement by threatening all political opposition.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美“间谍调查”被揭穿　非美活动委员会的捏造如此荒谬无耻美国反动报纸也供认是一种宣传作用\n\n1948-09-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美“间谍调查”被揭穿\n  　非美活动委员会的捏造如此荒谬无耻美国反动报纸也供认是一种宣传作用\n    【新华社陕北二十九日电】各方报导：美国共和党控制下的众院非美活动委员会所制造的“间谍调查”的荒诞喧嚣，已被悲惨地揭穿了。该委员会自七月三十日以来，即根据早于战前即成为联邦调查局特务的一个神经质女骗子，自称为“苏联间谍”的班特丽的捏造，先后传讯了若干罗斯福政府时代的官员，并宣布将另行传讯支持进步党的人士，大肆制造“间谍恐怖”。据华莱士宣称：前财次怀特在被传讯后，已于十六日被该委员会折磨致死。最近，该委员会又造出“杜鲁门隐藏苏联间谍的证据”，和哥伦比亚大学校长艾森豪威尔“接受共产党情报局金钱”的无聊谰言。由于他们的捏造如此荒谬与无耻，以致许多美国反动报纸也说出这是一种宣传作用，甚至曾根据班特丽诬陷而下令逮捕美共领袖的杜鲁门，在见及该委员会这种“调查”，不但旨在打击进步势力，而且也打击到他自己头上时，亦不得不于十九日再度声明不同意国会的“间谍调查”，并斥之为违反人权。\n    美进步党总统候选人华莱士最近在其广播演说中指出：非美活动委员会是国际资本家及军火商利益的代表，他们利润的增减完全根据世界危机和白色恐怖的程度而定，他们才是真正的巨大威胁，需要予以制止。美四位著名黑人领袖——歌王罗伯逊、历史学家杜波斯、政治家郝瓦德及“黑人通讯”报编辑邓基，及一群著名作家、艺术家、科学家，均于二十三日发表声明，反对制造歇斯底里，并要求迅速停止非美活动委员会的审讯，并指出这是“企图用威胁所有政治反对派来加强最近的战争宣传与一般的反动运动”。"

TASS reports: Since Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov protested on the 11th against the US intelligence agencies' connivance with White Russian bandits to illegally kidnap Soviet citizens, the US government has not only refused to notify the Soviet embassy of the whereabouts of the kidnapped Soviet citizen Samarin and his family, but has instead issued summons and hostile threats of punishment against Korsenkina, who was rescued by the Soviet Consul General in New York after escaping danger, completely denying the Soviet consulate's legitimate right to protect its citizens' freedom and human rights. Korsenkina, after being kidnapped and tortured by White bandits for a week, and then subjected to various threats from American reactionaries after escaping danger, suffered a nervous breakdown and jumped from the Soviet consulate in New York on the afternoon of the 12th. At that time, the US police violated diplomatic conventions, rushed into the Soviet consulate in New York, and abducted the injured Korsenkina, refusing Soviet personnel to visit her. Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, lodged another protest with the US government on the 14th for this reason. In its reply on the 19th, the US government not only unreasonably rejected the Soviet ambassador's protest, but also used the blatant slander that Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, had \"detained Korsenkina\" and \"violated the duties of diplomatic officials\" as an excuse to demand that Lomakin leave the United States. On the 24th, the Soviet Embassy in the United States, on behalf of the Soviet government, sent a formal note to the US government, which, in addition to refuting the US reply's sophistry and unreasonable condemnation point by point, announced the Soviet government's decision as follows: (1) The Soviet government has decided to immediately close its consulates in New York and San Francisco, because they can no longer perform their duties normally; (2) Based on the principle of reciprocity between the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet government believes that the US consulate in Vladivostok should be closed immediately, and the Soviet government's understanding with the US government regarding the opening of a US consulate in Leningrad should also be invalidated.\n\nFurthermore, the Truth Daily on the 22nd, in commenting on the US government's instigation of White Russian bandits to kidnap Soviet citizens and fabricate their names to publish anti-Soviet slanders, strongly condemned the unparalleled provocations of the American intelligence agencies against Soviet citizens, and pointed out that this was an attempt by American reactionaries to cover up the failure of their foreign policy. The American Workers' Daily pointed out: The kidnapping case of Soviet citizens is related to the \"secret plan\" of the United States to oppose the progressive forces of the world. The newspaper also stated that this is a shocking revelation of the American conspiracy to undermine Soviet-American peace.

The main reason was that county warehouse staff did not conduct timely and in-depth inspections, often relying on reports from the districts. Even when they went to the villages to inspect, they only talked to the village cadres, and sometimes only looked at the surface of the grain in the warehouses, without conducting thorough inspections. Some warehouse management personnel were irresponsible, neglecting the grain once it was allocated. Sometimes the allocating authorities did not pick up the grain in time, leading to the spoilage or infestation of large quantities of grain. The procrastination and irresponsibility in warehouse work were also serious. Some warehouses reported that the public grain was damp and needed to be dried, but the county warehouse staff did not dare to take responsibility for such matters, and had to request approval from the Prefectural Commissioner's Office Finance Section. However, due to the cumbersome procedures, the matter was delayed, causing a lot of public grain to rot. The grain stored in the warehouses was too much, making inspection difficult. Before it could be allocated, the grain at the bottom had already rotted. Based on the above situation, it was decided that warehouses should be separated in the future, and no single warehouse should concentrate too much grain. The two staff members of the county warehouse, in addition to transferring grain, should each be responsible for two districts, inspecting each warehouse once every ten days. After heavy rain, inspections should be carried out immediately. If spoilage is found, it should be reported immediately, and the grain in that warehouse should be allocated early to avoid wasting manpower. In the future, if public grain is found to be rotten again, the warehouse staff should bear appropriate responsibility.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 观城检查公粮仓库规定今后保管办法\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　观城检查公粮仓库规定今后保管办法\n    【冀鲁豫电】观城召开县仓库干部与财经干部会议，检查公粮屡次腐烂的原因，主要是县仓库员及时深入检查不够，常常听听区上的汇报就算了。即是到村里检查，也只是和村干部谈谈，有时也到仓房去看看表皮的粮食，并不做彻底的检查。某些仓库管理人员不负责任，把粮食批出去就不管了，有时拨粮机关并未及时取走，致使大批粮食腐烂，或生了虫子。仓库工作上的拖拉作风和不负责任的现象也很厉害。有的仓房报告公粮受了潮湿，应当晒晒，县仓库员对这种事不敢大胆负责，还得请示专署财经科批准，但因来回手续麻烦，拖延了时间，使很多公粮腐烂了。仓库存的粮食太多，检查很不容易。还没有拨完，下边的已经烂了。根据上述情况，确定今后仓房要分立，一个仓房不要集中粮食太多。县仓库的两个干事，除调运粮食外，各分工负责两个区，每十天到各仓房检查一次。大雨过后，要立即检查，发现腐烂立即报告，并提早拨发该仓房粮食，以免浪费人力。今后如再发现公粮腐烂，仓库干事应负适当责任。"

This year, the acreage and output of indigo have increased dramatically compared to previous years. In the area along both banks of the Fu River east of Nanyan Village and west of Fudong Bridge in Yongnian alone, the acreage and output of indigo this year have increased tenfold to fifteenfold compared to last year. Due to the influx of foreign dyes and the limited number of local dyeing houses, the sale of indigo has become a major problem, and prices have fallen accordingly. The price of the best red indigo this year is only about 4,000 yuan per jin (with a three-tael scale). Such indigo yields only thirty-five to forty jin per mu. Let's say it's forty jin, worth 160,000 yuan. However, each mu of indigo requires 400 jin of fertilizer (oil cake). Currently, local rapeseed cake costs 240,000 yuan per 1,000 jin (18-tael scale), which amounts to 96,000 yuan. Add to that the cost of consumption during soil manufacturing (good meals), which requires 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, totaling about 120,000 yuan (excluding the cost of frequent irrigation and weeding). Each mu of indigo yields only a profit of over 40,000 yuan, which can only buy 200 jin of rapeseed cake (fertilizer) or no more than 4 dou of millet. It turns out that planting indigo is less profitable than growing grain. Under such unprofitable circumstances, it is very difficult for indigo farmers to sell indigo and exchange it for other food. Because there is nowhere to sell, my village planted 80 mu of indigo, but only 3 mu have been sold to local small dyeing houses. The rest has been ignored. In general, indigo farmers urgently need to sell indigo to buy fertilizer for planting cabbage. The time for fertilizing cabbage is imminent, and it is difficult to proceed without fertilizer. I hope that the editor will appeal on our behalf and suggest to our government and relevant agricultural authorities to establish shops for the purchase and sale of indigo and to provide indigo loans to facilitate adjustments and benefit production. Otherwise, not only will the acreage of indigo be reduced next year, affecting the resistance to enemy loans, but also this season's cabbage production will be greatly affected.\n    A concerned indigo-planting farmer from Dabo Village, Yongnian.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 请政府给土靛想出路\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：群众呼声\n\n　　请政府给土靛想出路编辑同志：\n    为了抵制敌货，发展解放区的土靛生产，政府和报纸积极提倡种土靛，今年种土靛的亩数和产量比往年有极大的增加。仅永年南沿村以东、府东桥以西的滏河两岸，今年种土靛的亩数和产量，比去年增加了十倍至十五倍。由于外来的颜料充斥，本地的染房又滑有多少，土靛的出售成了大困难，价格也随之低落。今年最好的红色靛价格，每斤（加三秤）在四千元左右。像这样的靛每亩地仅产三十五斤到四十斤，就按四十斤算吧，值十六万元。但每亩土靛得用肥料（油饼）四百斤，现下当地菜子饼每千斤（十八两秤）二十四万元，该洋九万六千元；再加土制造时的消耗（吃好饭），需一万至两万，共费去十二万元左右（经常浇锄人工在外），每亩靛仅落四万余元，只能买二百斤菜子饼（肥料），买小米也不过四斗，算起来种靛还不如种粮食利大。在这样不合算的情况下，种靛户想把靛买用换成其他食料是很不容易的。因为无处可卖，我村种土靛八十亩，现下卖给本地小染房的滑有三亩，其余就无人过问。一般的种靛户，极需售靛卖肥料养种白菜；刻下白菜施肥在即，无肥难以下。望编辑同志代为呼吁，向我政府及有关农业机关建议，设收卖土靛的商店，我指靛贷款，以资调剂而利生产。否则不仅来年土靛亩数减少。以抵制敌贷，且本季白菜生产也受莫大的影乡。    永年大堡种靛户农民谨启"

On this day last year, the army first crossed the Yellow River and entered western Henan. In the past year, they have established liberated areas in western Henan and southern Shaanxi, liberating the broad masses of the people. On that day, national flags were hung all over the city, and a dozen Yangko teams appeared on the streets, with drums and music filling the air. The anniversary meeting also held an exhibition of the achievements of the past year's victories, which was extremely crowded with spectators. The exhibition charts explained that Chen Xie's army had annihilated 130,000 Kuomintang troops in the past year, captured 17 Kuomintang generals, captured 51 cities, and liberated nearly 10 million people. Generals Chen Geng and Xie Fuzhi personally attended the meeting, and the audience cheered like thunder when they entered. At the beginning of the meeting, Chief of Staff General Wang Qiming explained the victorious situation of the Central Plains Liberated Area in front of a large map. Then, Director of the Political Department General Liu Youguang gave a report. He pointed out that the reasons for the victory in the past year were: First, the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's great strategic policy of pushing the war into the Kuomintang-controlled areas; second, the powerful cooperation of Liu Deng and Chen Su's advance into the Central Plains and the three major field armies; third, the correct leadership of Chen Xie's leaders, the efforts of all commanders and fighters, and the support of the people of western Henan. He said: In the past year, we have not only learned to fight, but also initially learned to mobilize the masses and manage cities. He called on everyone not to be arrogant and complacent, but to more bravely annihilate the enemy, completely liberate the Central Plains, and continue to push the war into the Kuomintang-controlled areas; and to better learn to implement the Party's policies, implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and overcome certain undisciplined and unorganized tendencies. Finally, the congress passed a message of greetings to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the leaders of the Central Plains Military Region, and the Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China in North China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陈谢大军前线某城集会　庆祝胜利南征周年\n\n1948-09-03\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陈谢大军前线某城集会\n  　庆祝胜利南征周年\n    【新华社中原三十一日电】陈谢大军八月二十三日在前线某城集会庆祝渡河南征、进军豫陕鄂的周年纪念。该军于去年此日，首跨黄河，进入豫西。一年来建立了豫西、陕南解放区，解救了广大的人民。是日该城遍悬国旗，十几队秧歌出现街头，鼓乐喧阗。纪念大会并举行一年胜利战绩展览，观众极为拥挤。展览图表说明陈谢大军一年来共歼国民党军十三万人，俘国民党军将级军官十七人，攻克城市五十一座，解放人口近一千万。陈赓、谢富治两将军亲临参加大会，入场时全场欢呼雷动。大会首由参谋长王启明将军在大幅地图前讲解中原解放区的胜利形势。继由政治部主任刘有光将军报告。他指出一年来取得胜利的原因是：一、毛主席把战争推向国民党统治区的伟大战略方针的英明指导；二、刘邓、陈粟的进军中原与三大野战军的有力配合；三、陈谢首长的正确领导，全体指战员的努力，及豫西人民的支援。他说：一年来我们不但学会了打仗，而且初步学会了发动群众与管理城市。他号召大家不要骄傲自满，要更英勇地歼灭敌人，彻底解放中原，继续把战争推向国民党统治区；并要更好地学会执行党的政策，执行三大纪律八项注意，克服某些无纪律、无组织的倾向。大会最后通过致电毛主席、朱总司令、中原军区首长及中共华北中央局致敬。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: News from Kuomintang-controlled newspapers: Enemy troops are frantically enlisting soldiers in cities such as Qingdao and Guangzhou, arousing active or passive resistance from citizens. Since mid-June, Qingdao has been shrouded in the terror of conscription. Whenever citizens leave their homes, they join together in groups to prevent being captured alone. Some even carry stones to resist. Whenever enemy military vehicles stop or enemy troops move in groups, citizens flee far away. Those who are captured shout and scream, resisting to the death, and run away whenever they have the opportunity. A carpenter at the Qianhai Pier jumped into the sea to escape after being captured. On June 10th, a fish vendor who was captured at Haibo Bridge drew a knife, stabbed the conscriptor, and escaped. On the same day, conscriptors grabbed a military officer. After the officer's explanation of his identity proved ineffective, he ordered his subordinates to open fire, and the two sides fought for a long time. On June 12th, when the enemy was conscripting soldiers in the city, many shops closed their doors, resembling a strike, to confront them. In June and July, enemy troops in Guangzhou used both hard conscription and deceptive abduction methods in the prosperous streets of Changdi, Haizhu Bridge, and Henan. The former involved armed soldiers suddenly and forcibly beating citizens, falsely accusing them of being \"deserters\" or \"thieves,\" and forcibly dragging them away. Those who were captured wailed and screamed, a tragic sight. The latter used various means to lure the victims into the military camp, then strip them of their clothes, shave their heads, and force them to \"enlist.\" After the conscripts were caught and deceived, they were secretly transported to Taiwan and other places, making it impossible for their families to rescue them. On July 7th, Zhong Bingnan and Xie Jianyu, students of the Cultural Middle School, were lured onto a boat on the South Bank and secretly transported to the Foshan town near Guangzhou to enter the camp.\n\nAnother report: In June, when Hubei's Hefeng County received new recruits, it implemented tortures such as hanging, nose piercing, and abdominal stabbing. Six new recruits were covered in injuries on the spot, and two disappeared. One of them was found in Wangjiaping Lake in the county, his head had been cut off, his arms had been sawn off, the muscles of his right leg had been completely peeled off, and his body was covered with carrying-pole bruises. After this atrocity was discovered, it shocked the entire county, and more than seventy new recruits collectively broke through the enemy's heavy cordon and fled on the morning of June 15th.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 青岛广州敌疯狂抓丁　市民拼死反抗\n\n1948-09-03\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　青岛广州敌疯狂抓丁\n  　市民拼死反抗\n    【新华社陕北卅日电】综合国民党区报刊消息：敌军在青岛、广州等城市疯狂抓丁，激起市民积极或积极的反抗。六月中旬以来，青岛经常笼罩在抓丁恐怖中，市民每逢出门，即连结多人，以防势单被抓；有的更怀揣石头，以备反抗。每当敌用军汽车停下或敌军集体出动时，市民即远远逃避。被抓者大喊大叫，拼死反抗，得机会即逃跑。前海栈桥有一木匠被抓，即跳入海内逃生。六月十日海泊桥被抓的一位鱼贩，曾抽出刀子将抓丁者刺伤后逃走。同日抓丁者将一军官抓住，该军官在说明自己身份无效后，即指挥所属开枪，双方格斗多时。六月十二日敌在市内抓丁时，许多商店均关门，形同罢市，以为对抗。六、七月份，广州敌军在长堤、海珠桥及河南一带繁盛街道，使用硬抓与诱掳两种方式进行抓丁。前者是由武装士兵将市民突予强行殴打，并诬指为“逃兵”或“小偷”，强拉硬拖而去。被抓者号哭惨叫，凄惨异常。后者则用种种手段，使被诱者进入部队营地，然后进行剥衣剃头，强迫“入伍”。壮丁抓骗到手后，即偷运至台湾等地，使家属无从营救。七月七日文化中学学生钟炳南及谢建瑜，在南堤被诱上艇，偷运至广州附近的佛山镇入营。\n    另息：六月间鄂西鹤峰县在接收新兵时，曾施行吊顶、穿鼻及刺腹毒等刑，当场有新兵六名遍体鳞伤，两名失踪，旋于该县王家坪湖泊中发现其中一名，头已被割去，两膀被锯断，右腿筋肉全遭剥落，满身扁担伤痕。此暴行被发现后，惊震全县，新兵七十余人于六月十五日上午集体冲破敌重重警戒线逃去。"

The Malayan liberation movement is so powerful that, according to the British government's own statistics, when the democratic forces' united front called for a boycott of the elections in early summer, 94 percent of Singapore voters refused to participate in the farcical elections. The Communist Party, which is now fighting to defend Malayan freedom, had approximately 10,000 members in July. The armed forces under its leadership have been officially named the Malayan People's Anti-British Army. There are no precise statistics on its numbers, but at least the majority of the 8,000-strong wartime People's Anti-Japanese Army has been mobilized. In the first phase of the war, the British made much of their \"jungle clearing operations,\" but failed to capture any people's leaders or destroy guerrilla headquarters. The British army's offensive was actually used to intimidate the people, and as a result, even British officers themselves admit that the difficulty lies in \"finding the enemy.\" Entering the jungle to sweep, the only results brought back were the killing of small batches of \"suspects\"; the rocket-launching Spitfire fighters only ravaged villages suspected of being guerrilla concentration points. Now, the British are planning to launch a \"general offensive\" in an attempt to gain control of major cities and break the main force of the guerrillas, driving them into the jungle areas; however, no responsible official believes that this war is sure to be won.

Grandma Pang made six pairs by herself. When the village cadres assigned Zhao Yu, a woman from Huangpu Village, to make one pair, she insisted on making ten pairs, saying, \"Isn't the army fighting hard on the front lines for us, the common people?

On the 16th, two battalions of the enemy's 46th Division again invaded eastward from Zaotan Factory (southeast of Huoshan) and were ambushed by our forces, resulting in over a hundred enemy casualties.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 31st: A certain unit of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army, on August 21st, raided the enemy stronghold of Jiuzhen Temple north of Tianmen in one fell swoop, annihilating the 14th Company of the Tianmen County Security Force, killing the enemy company commander Xie Guangqin and seven others, and capturing twenty-nine enemies. On the 22nd, the 80th Brigade of the enemy's 28th Division, with one battalion in coordination with two local Chiang Kai-shek companies, invaded the Jiuzhen Temple area from the north of Tianmen, and was completely crushed by another unit of our People's Liberation Army. Twelve enemies below the platoon leader level were killed, and thirty were captured alive, including the company commander. The above two battles resulted in the capture of one mortar, one 60mm mortar, two light machine guns, four submachine guns, and fifty-nine rifles. We suffered no casualties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中原再克漯河郾城　皖西我军反“扫荡”伸至外线歼敌百余\n\n1948-09-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中原再克漯河郾城\n  　皖西我军反“扫荡”伸至外线歼敌百余\n    【新华社中原前线三十一日电】中原解放军某部，八月二十三日下午再度收复平汉线上之漯河、郾城两重镇。守敌一部被消灭，大部南窜。\n    【新华社中原三十日电】皖西解放军于本月一日在舒城以南歼敌安徽省保三团大部后，国民党第八绥区即纠集其四八师三个团，四六师两个营及安徽省保安团一部，于九日分股向我岳西、霍山、舒城、桐城之间地区大举窜犯，企图进行报复性的合击“扫荡”。我军机动击敌，并与友邻部队配合，向敌反击，至十二日迫使该敌全部仓皇窜返原防，完全粉碎其“扫荡”。仲至外线我军，复于十二、十三两日在冶溪（岳西西南）、沈家桥（舒城以东）、中梅河（舒城西南）分别击溃土著国民党军各一部，共毙俘其六十余人。十六日敌四六师两个营复由皂坦厂（霍山东南）东犯遭我伏击，毙伤敌百余人。\n    【新华社中原前线三十一日电】中原解放军某部，于八月二十一日一举袭入天门以北之九真庙敌据点，歼敌天门县保安第十四中队，毙敌中队长谢光钦以下七人，俘敌二十九人。二十二日敌二十八师八十旅，以一个营配合土蒋两个中队，由天门北犯九真庙地区，又被我另部解放军全部击溃。毙敌排长以下十二人，生俘连长以下三十名。以上两次战斗共缴迫击炮一门，六零炮一门，轻机枪二挺，冲锋机枪四挺，步枪五十九支。我无伤亡。"

The congress lasted for thirteen days and closed on the 19th. The congress passed many important resolutions and elected the members of the North China People's Government, forming the unified democratic government of North China - the North China People's Government.\n\nA total of 541 representatives attended the congress, out of 598 eligible representatives. The attending representatives included workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers, women, industrialists and merchants, liberal professionals, new-style rich peasants, social elites, enlightened gentry, as well as members of the Democratic League, representatives of ethnic minorities, and people's organizations from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The preparatory meeting of the congress elected Dong Biwu, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Peng Zhen, Teng Daiyuan, Yang Xiufeng, Song Shaowen, Cheng Fangwu, Xing Zhaotang, Gao Zhen (widow of Wen Yiduo), Ding Yi (member of the Democratic League), Yu Li, He Qikuan (Hui nationality), Chen Jinkun, Tian Xiujuan (woman), Lan Gongwu, Shi Zhenming (labor hero), Xu Weilian (representative from the Kuomintang-controlled area), Li Helin (member of the Democratic League), Ling Biying (worker), An Zairen, and Shang Yue (member of the Democratic League) as the 33 members of the presidium of the congress, and elected representatives such as Yang Xiufeng to form a representative qualification review committee.\n\nFrom the 9th, the congress successively heard reports from representatives Yang Xiufeng and Song Shaowen on the government work of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee over the past two years, a military report from representative Nie Rongzhen on the North China Military Region over the past two years, a suggestion report from representative Bo Yibo on behalf of the CCP North China Central Bureau regarding the policy guidelines for the North China Liberated Area, as well as explanations from representatives Yang Xiufeng, Xie Juezai, and Rong Wusheng on the drafting process and spirit of important legal drafts such as the \"North China People's Government Organizational Outline Draft,\" \"Village, County, and City People's Representative Election Regulations Draft,\" \"Village, County, and City People's Regime Organization Regulations Draft,\" and \"North China Liberated Area Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations Draft.\" The representatives submitted a total of 1,180 proposals. From the 13th, the congress moved into the review and discussion of various important laws and proposals, electing six review committees on policy guidelines, the organizational outline of the People's Government, government work reports, the election law and regime organization law for village, county, and city people's representatives, military reports, and agricultural tax regulations. In addition, a proposal review committee was elected, divided into eight groups: military and political affairs, agriculture, industry and commerce, civil affairs, finance, culture and education, transportation, and Yellow River water conservancy. The representatives participated in various committees or groups, engaging in detailed and heated discussions. On the 16th, the congress heard and discussed the review reports of various review committees and groups, and voted on various laws and proposals. At this point, the election of members of the North China People's Government began. The congress decided that the number of government members would be 39, reserving 12 vacancies to adapt to the development of the North China situation, so that representatives from the soon-to-be-liberated areas could jointly participate in the government. The representatives carefully discussed and nominated candidates. On the 18th, after a secret ballot, Dong Biwu, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, Xu Xiangqian, Teng Daiyuan, Huang Jing, Xie Juezai, Fan Wenlan, Cheng Fangwu, Yang Xiufeng, Song Shaowen, Nan Hanchen, Rong Wusheng, Ling Biying, Zhang Su, Chen Jinkun, Lan Gongwu, Yu Li, Xing Zhaotang, Xue Xun, Yin Xipeng, Zhao Erlu, Jia Xinzai, Huang Zhefu, Liu Yuchen, Xu Zheng, and Wang Fuchu, a total of 27 people, were elected as government members. The North China People's Government, eagerly anticipated by the 45 million people of the North China Liberated Area, was thus declared established. The entire congress process fully embodied the patriotic, democratic, and united front, and the spirit of democratic unity regardless of race, party affiliation, belief, gender, or occupation, to fight for the complete overthrow of the rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries in China.\n\nOn the evening of the 19th, the congress victoriously concluded amidst enthusiastic cheers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中国民主史程上划时代的一页　华北召开临时人民代表大会　民主选举委员组成华北人民政府　经详尽讨论通过许多重要决议董必武等廿七人当选政府委员\n\n1948-09-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中国民主史程上划时代的一页\n  　华北召开临时人民代表大会\n  　民主选举委员组成华北人民政府\n  　经详尽讨论通过许多重要决议董必武等廿七人当选政府委员\n    【新华社华北三十一日电】在中国民主史程上具有很大意义的华北临时人民代表大会，八月七日在华北某地隆重揭幕。大会先后历时十三日，于十九日闭幕。大会通过了许多重要决议案，并选举了华北人民政府委员，组成了华北统一的民主政府——华北人民政府。\n    大会共出席代表五百四十一名，应出席代表为五百九十八名。出席代表中包括了工人、农民、革命军人、妇女、工商业家、自由职业者、新式富农、社会贤达、开明绅士以及民主同盟盟员、少数民族和国民党统治区人民团体的代表。大会的预备会议推选了董必武、聂荣臻、薄一波、彭真、滕代远、杨秀峰、宋劭文、成仿吾、邢肇棠、高真（闻一多夫人）、丁易（民盟盟员）、于力、何其宽（回民）、陈瑾昆、田秀涓（妇女）、蓝公武、石振明（劳动英雄）、徐维廉（国民党统治区代表）、李何林（民盟盟员）、凌必应（工人）、安宅仁、尚钺（民盟盟员）等三十三人组成大会主席团，并选出杨秀峰等代表成立代表资格审查委员会。\n    九日起，大会先后听取了杨秀峰、宋劭文两代表关于晋冀鲁豫边区政府及晋察冀边区行政委员会两年来的政府工作报告、聂荣臻代表关于华北军区两年来的军事报告、薄一波代表代表中共华北中央局关于华北解放区施政方针的建议报告，以及杨秀峰、谢觉哉、戎伍胜三代表关于“华北人民政府组织大纲草案”、“村县市人民代表选举条例草案”、“村县市人民政权组织条例草案”、“华北解放区农业税暂行税则草案”诸重要法案的起草经过及其精神的说明。各代表提案共达一千一百八十件，自十三日起，大会即转入各种重要法案与提案的审查及讨论，选出施政方针、人民政府组织大纲、政府工作报告、村县市人民代表选举法及政权组织法、军事报告、农业税则等六个审查委员会；另选出提案审查委员会，下分军事政治、农业、工商、民政、财政、文教、交通、黄河水利等八个组。各代表均分头参加各会或组，展开详尽而热烈的讨论。十六日大会听取和讨论了各审查会、组的审查报告，并对各项法案与提案进行表决。至此，开始进行选举华北人民政府委员事宜。大会决定政府委员名额为三十九人，为适应华北形势之发展，保留十二名空额，以便即将解放的地区人民代表得以共同参加政府。各代表均慎重讨论与推举了候选人。十八日，经无记名投票选举结果，董必武、聂荣臻、薄一波、徐向前、滕代远、黄敬、谢觉哉、范文澜、成仿吾、杨秀峰、宋劭文、南汉宸、戎伍胜、凌必应、张苏、陈瑾昆、蓝公武、于力、邢肇棠、薛迅、殷希彭、赵尔陆、贾心斋、晃哲甫、刘雨辰、徐正、王复初共二十七人当选为政府委员。华北解放区四千五百万人民殷切期望的华北人民政府由是宣告成立。整个大会过程充分体现了爱国民主统一战线、和不分种族、党派、信仰、性别、职业的民主团结、为彻底推翻美帝国主义和国民党反动派在中国的统治而战斗的精神。\n    十九日晚，大会于热烈欢呼中胜利闭幕。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Mutual Aid Benefits Everyone\n  　Li Zhenlu's Mutual Aid Group Never Misses a Thing\n    [Taiyue Telegraph] Li Zhenlu, a poor peasant in Xiwuwu Village, Fifth District of Jicheng, discussed with five close neighbors in front of his house during the spring plowing season, saying, \"Why don't we form a mutual aid group?\" The five families agreed, and they elected Li Zhenlu as the leader. The families together had eight full laborers, one half-laborer, two cows, and 215 mu of land. They worked together, initially not keeping accounts, but just estimating in their minds, considering the work and labor to be equivalent. Just as they were sowing seeds, they happened to be called upon to join the battle in Linfen, and six full laborers from the group left at once, immediately causing a labor shortage. When the six who joined the battle left, they all felt that their family's production would be affected. Gu Chengxi said, \"If everyone can help me, then help me, if you can't help, then let the weeds take over.\" Zhang Lianke also planted several ridges of tobacco seedlings and was afraid that if he was called away, no one would take care of them, and they would die of drought. Li Zhenlu understood everyone's concerns and led everyone to work harder, doing whoever's work was most urgent first, and doing whatever was most urgent first. He first calculated how many ridges of tobacco seedlings everyone in the group needed to plant and then concentrated their efforts to plant 150 ridges. This solved the problem of tobacco seedlings for everyone in the group at once. He also organized the half-laborer: the old man plowed the land, and the women and children sowed seeds, using this method to plant 28 mu of cotton, 10 mu of sesame, 7 mu of sorghum, and 20 mu of sweet potatoes and watermelons. The women in this village used to do nothing, and even grinding grain relied on men. This time they did so much work, and when the people who joined the battle came back, they saw that nothing had been missed in production and said with smiles, \"This year, the mutual aid group is really useful.\" Zhang Zilai said, \"If it weren't for the mutual aid group, the land would have been deserted when people went to war, and the cattle would have been idle in the stalls with no one to use them.\" Gu Chengxi said, \"Knowing that our mutual aid group is like this, we can rest assured when we are called upon in the future.\" The good production performance of Li Zhenlu's mutual aid group influenced Zhang Mingxin, Li Mingchang, and others who were unwilling to participate in mutual aid, and they volunteered to join his mutual aid group. At the time of wheat harvesting, the whole group increased from five households to twelve households, and the number of livestock increased from two to five. In addition, seven women also wanted to join his mutual aid group. At this time, Li Zhenlu's mutual aid group took a step forward and decided to record work points based on the amount of work done. Zhou Lianhua, a woman, cut wheat the same as men, so she was given ten points. This method made everyone more willing to work hard. In four days, all 293 mu of wheat in the group were harvested. Their labor price was not fixed, but adjusted according to the season. Usually, every ten points of work were worth four jin of wheat, but during the wheat season, it became one dou. This was because at this time, everyone could pick up one dou of wheat a day, and if the labor price was not increased, everyone's enthusiasm would be reduced. Accounts were settled once a month, with surpluses and shortages being compensated, and no one owing anyone anything. Now all the group's wheat fields have been plowed two or three times. They plan to plow them again thoroughly so that by the time of wheat sowing, they will have been plowed five times. The autumn fields have been weeded twice and are starting to be weeded a third time. In the past, cotton was only hoed once, but this year it has been hoed four times. The last time there was a heavy rain, everyone proposed to plant a large number of vegetables to ensure that they would not have to buy vegetables in the fall. The group planted a total of three mu of red and white radishes, two mu of green onions, and one mu of mixed vegetables. After harvesting the vegetables, half of them will be sold, and the rest will be enough to eat. The group planted 20 mu of tobacco (which can yield 2,000 jin) and plans to build a tobacco-curing furnace to cure the tobacco leaves, making them easier to sell. They also plan that after plowing the wheat fields three times, the whole group will take time to transport coal once to prepare for curing the tobacco leaves. Everyone happily said, \"This year, the mutual aid group has done the right thing. The fields have never been worked as well as they have been this year.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 互助起来人人得利　李振禄互助组啥活也没误\n\n1948-09-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　互助起来人人得利\n  　李振禄互助组啥活也没误\n    【太岳电】冀城五区西仵伍村贫农李振禄，在春耕时和门前五家亲邻商量说：“咱几家成立一个变工组吧。”当时这五家都很赞成，就推李振禄当组长。几家合起来共有八个全劳力，一个半劳力，两头牛，二百一十五亩地。他们在一块儿做活，起初不记帐，只是心里盘谋一下，活与活、工与工相等就算啦。正在下种时候，可巧碰到要上临汾参战，组里一下就走了六个全劳力，马上感到劳力困难。当参战的六个人走时，都觉着家里的生产要受影响，谷成喜说：“大家能帮助我做就做一做，不能帮助做，就叫草混去吧。”张连科又种几畦旱烟苗，也恐怕支差走了没人管，旱死了。李振禄摸透了大家的心思，就领导大家加紧作活，谁的活紧先给谁作；什么活紧先作什么。他把全组谁需要种多少畦旱烟苗先统计了一下，然后集中力量突击，种了一百五十畦。把全组人的烟苗问题一下就解决了。又把半劳力也组织起来：老汉犁地，妇女儿童溜籽，用这种方法种了二十八亩棉花，十亩芝麻，七亩高粱，二十亩红薯和西瓜。这村妇女过去啥活也不干，连推磨都靠男人。这次干了这样多的活，参战人回来一看，啥生产都没有误，笑嘻嘻的说：“今年变工组可真管用啦。”张子来说：“如果不是变工组，人去参战，地也荒啦，牛在槽上闲着，也没人使。”谷成喜说：“知道咱变工组有这个样儿，以后支差就放心啦。”李振禄变工组生产成绩好，把不愿互助的张鸣信、李鸣昌等影响得也自愿报名参加了他的变工组。收麦时，全组由五户增加到十二户，牲口由两头增加到五头。另外还有七个妇女也要参加他的变工组。这时李振禄的变工组向前发展了一步，决定按做活多少记工，妇女周莲花割麦和男人一样，就给记十分。这样干法，更使大家愿意出力。四天工夫就将全组二百九十三亩麦子全部割完了。他们的工价不定死，按季节走。平时每十分工四市斤麦子，到麦时就成了一斗。因为这时每人一天可拾一斗麦子，工价如不提高，大家情绪就要降低。一月结算一次帐，长支短补，互不欠帐。现在全组麦地都犁过两遍、三遍。计划还用翻犁大翻一遍，到种麦时要犁够五遍。秋地都锄过两遍，已开始锄三遍了。棉花往年只是刀一下，今年全锄过四遍。前次下透雨，大家提出要大量种菜，保证秋后不买菜吃。全组共种了红白萝卜三亩，葱二亩，杂菜一亩。收了菜，卖上一半，剩下的还可够吃。组里种的二十亩烟（能收两千斤），计划盖一座薰烟炉，把烟叶薰一薰，容易卖钱，又计划翻过三遍麦地后，全组再抽空运一次煤炭，以备薰烟叶时用。大家都高兴的说：“今年互助组可搞对啦，这几年的地里都没有今年做的好。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th.\nComprehensive reports indicate that since the Kuomintang government implemented its so-called \"currency reform,\" \"price controls,\" and \"ban on the black market,\" prices have risen in all major cities under its control, including Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Guiyang, and Xi'an. Black market activities continue. Taking Shanghai, the economic center of the Kuomintang government, as an example, \"cotton, cotton yarn, flour, miscellaneous grains, cigarettes, and other daily necessities have all risen in price compared to the previous day\" (Reuters, 25th). A large number of merchants holding newly obtained fake gold yuan certificates \"have begun to attack the market. Those who hoard gold and US dollars have switched to hoarding commodities\" (Associated Press, 24th). The fake Shanghai Municipal Government's wholesale commodity index, released on the 25th, also admitted that \"from August 16th to 21st, prices rose by an average of 15 percent.\" According to an Associated Press report on the 24th, the Shanghai authorities were \"shocked by the continuing rise in prices\" and arrested \"more than a hundred vegetable, fish, and meat vendors\" on the morning of the 24th. Economic agents and police are arbitrarily breaking into all stock markets, grain stores, warehouses, and banks to conduct \"inspections\" and make arrests. They even break into stationery stores and \"drag merchants out,\" imposing fines and imprisonment. Therefore, as reported by an Associated Press reporter on the 25th, Shanghai merchants are \"clearing their shelves to retaliate against the government's order to freeze prices at the August 19th level. There is very little pork in Shanghai's major food markets today (the 25th), and live chickens are almost non-existent. Stale fish is sold at the highest price for top-quality goods on August 19th. Tofu is sold at the highest limit price, but the quantity is reduced.\"\n\nIn other areas, Chiang Kai-shek is arresting merchants and peddlers en masse, attempting to suppress prices with fascist violence. According to continuous reports from the bandit Central News Agency, economic agents and police arrested four merchants in Nanjing on the 25th. In Qingdao, 53 black market gold certificate merchants were arrested. In Guiyang, several cases involving meat, rice, and salt were uncovered. In Chengdu, several stores, yarn factories, and salt shops were inspected and fined on the 24th and 25th, and two silver dollar vendors were arrested. In Xi'an, eight stores, including general merchandise stores, pharmacies, and barbershops, have been ordered to suspend business for five days each and fined 30 fake gold yuan certificates. In Tianjin, several department stores and hotels have been ordered to suspend business for three days or handed over to the so-called \"Special Criminal Court.\" In Xuzhou, on the Central China front, more than a hundred rice and meat merchants and silver dollar peddlers have been arrested. In Peiping, Guangzhou, Hankou, Wuchang, Hangzhou, Nanchang, and other places, merchants are also being arrested on a large scale due to rising prices. Along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, the black market is particularly active.\n\nThe above situation proves that the Kuomintang government's so-called \"currency reform\" and the \"gold yuan certificate\" it issued still cannot deceive the people's discerning eyes. The so-called \"emergency decree\" to \"control prices\" and \"ban the black market\" is nothing more than a fascist violent suppression of all classes of people who oppose this large-scale plunder. However, this kind of violent suppression cannot maintain the \"credit\" of the \"gold yuan certificate,\" just as it cannot avoid the bankruptcy of the \"legal tender.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 伪金元券骗不了人民　蒋区物价普遍上涨　蒋贼妄图以暴力压抑大捕商人小贩\n\n1948-09-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　伪金元券骗不了人民\n  　蒋区物价普遍上涨\n  　蒋贼妄图以暴力压抑大捕商人小贩\n    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合各方消息：国民党政府于实行所谓“改革币制”，以及“限制物价”、“禁止黑市”后，其统治区内京、沪、平、津、汉口、广州、杭州、成都、贵阳、西安等各大城市，日来物价无不上涨，黑市也继续活动。以国民党政府的经济中心上海为例，“棉花、棉纱、面粉、杂粮、香烟及其他日用必需品，较前一日均有上涨”（路透社二十五日电）。握有最近获得的伪金圆券的大批商人，“已开始袭击市场。囤积黄金美钞的人，已改而囤积商品”（合众社二十四日电）。伪上海市政府于二十五日发表的批发商品指数，也承认：“八月十六日到二十一日，物价平均上涨百分之十五”。据合众社二十四日消息称：上海市当局已为物价仍然上涨的“倾向所震惊”，于二十四日晨逮捕“蔬菜鱼肉商贩百余人”之多。经济特务及警察正在任意闯入一切证券市场、粮行、货栈、银行，进行“检查”并捕人。甚至闯入文具店，将“商人拖出来”，处以罚金和监禁。因此，如美联社记者二十五日所报导的，上海商人正“把货架肃清，来报复政府冻结物价于八月十九日水平的命令。上海各主要食品市场上，今日（二十五日）猪肉很少，活鸡几告绝迹。不新鲜的鱼类，以八月十九日上等货的最高价格出售。豆腐以最高的限定价格出售，但数量却减少了”。\n    其他各地，蒋贼正在大批逮捕商人、小贩，企图以法西斯的暴力手段压抑物价。据匪中央社连日报导供认：经济特务及警察，二十五日在南京逮捕商人四名。青岛逮捕金钞黑市商人五十三名。贵阳逮捕肉、米、盐等数起。成都于二十四、二十五两日检查商店、纱厂、盐店数家受罚，银元贩两名被捕。西安已有行货、药房、理发等八家商店，各被勒令停业五天及罚伪金圆券三十元。天津百货、旅馆业数家，被分别勒令停业三天或交所谓“特种刑庭”。华中前线的徐州，共逮捕米、肉商人及银元小贩百余人。其余在北平、广州、汉口、武昌、杭州、南昌等地，亦因物价上涨，而在大捕商人。京沪路沿线各地，则黑市非当活跃。\n    上述这些情况，证明国民党政府的所谓“改革币制”，它所发行的“金圆券”，依然骗不过人民的雪亮的眼睛，而所谓“限制物价”、“禁止黑市”的“紧急处分令”，则不过是对所有反对这次大掠夺的各阶层人民采取法西斯的暴力镇压而已，但是这种暴力镇压决不能维持“金圆券”的“信用”，正如它之不能避免“法币”的破产一样。"

What is the overview of these democratic parties and groups?\n\n　　Answer: The following is a brief introduction to the democratic parties and groups that telegraphed Chairman Mao on May 5th to support the convening of a new political consultative conference:\n\n　　Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang\n\n　　The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was formally established in Hong Kong on New Year's Day, 1948. Prior to this, some members of the Kuomintang who opposed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship had broken away from the Kuomintang and established separate organizations. These included the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association led by Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai, and the Three People's Principles Comrades Association led by He Xiangning, Liu Yazi, and Tan Pingshan. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was a unified leading body formed by these two organizations and other anti-Chiang Kuomintang members such as Feng Yuxiang and Zhu Xuefan. When the committee was established, it issued a declaration and action program, declaring that \"the foreign and domestic policies decided by the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang are the basic principles,\" advocating that the policy of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants should be expanded to include \"uniting with all nations in the world that treat us equally,\" \"uniting with all democratic parties in the country,\" and \"land to the tillers.\" At the same time, it advocated \"overthrowing Chiang\" and \"opposing the United States\" to establish a democratic coalition government.\n\n　　China Democratic League\n\n　　The predecessor of the China Democratic League was the United Association for National Construction, established in January 1940. In March 1941, it was renamed the Democratic League of Political Groups. Participants included the National Salvation Association, the Third Party (later renamed the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party), the China Vocational Education Society, the Rural Reconstruction Faction, the Northeast Revolutionary Comrades Association, the National Socialist Party (later renamed the Democratic Socialist Party), the Youth Party, and individual league members such as Zhang Yimin and Liu Yazi, and Zhang Lan. It was not until September 1945 that it was called by its current name. Before the 1946 Political Consultative Conference, the Youth Party defected to Chiang Kai-shek and withdrew from the Democratic League. The following year, in January, the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League expelled another reactionary organization, the Democratic Socialist Party. Since the Political Consultative Conference, they have advocated stopping the civil war and implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. League members Wen Yiduo, Li Gongpu, and Du Binzhang were all murdered by Chiang Kai-shek for opposing the civil war and opposing the dictatorship. In November 1946, Chiang Kai-shek convened a puppet National Assembly, and in the spring of 1947, the puppet government was reorganized, and they all refused to participate. In November, the Kuomintang government announced the dissolution of the Democratic League, and on November 5th, the League's chairman, Zhang Lan, announced the \"automatic dissolution\" of the Democratic League. Soon after, another group of leaders of the League, such as Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, and Zhou Xinmin, fled to Hong Kong and, together with their southern leaders such as Deng Chumin, Peng Zemin, and Shen Zhiyuan, held the Third Plenary Session in January 1948, rebuilt the leadership structure, and issued a declaration, putting forward four propositions: \"First, under the current situation, it is impossible to achieve China's peace and democracy through negotiations and compromises; second, oppose the entire group representing landlords, local bullies, compradores, and feudalism, and thoroughly implement land reform, so that industry and commerce can prosper; third, oppose the United States' policy of aggression against China and do not recognize any treaties that harm the interests of the Chinese people; fourth, be willing to cooperate with all democratic parties to create a strong democratic united front. The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of democracy, and its history of struggle is worthy of the respect of every patriotic Chinese. This League is willing to work hand in hand with them.\"\n\n　　China Association for Promoting Democracy\n\n　　The China Association for Promoting Democracy was established in Shanghai during the 1946 Political Consultative Conference. It was composed of a group of scholars, writers, and industrialists from Shanghai, and its leaders were Ma Xulun and Wang Shao'ao. On June 23, 1946, representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai went to Nanjing to petition against the civil war and advocate peace. 50,000 to 60,000 Shanghai citizens saw them off at the station. They arrived in Nanjing that evening and were beaten by Kuomintang secret agents at the Xiaguan Railway Station. Most of the representatives were leading members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy.\n\n　　Chee Kung Party\n\n　　The Hongmen was an organization that opposed the Qing Dynasty and sought to restore the Ming Dynasty during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. After the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution, Hongmen leader Yang Fuqing went to the Americas and founded the Hongmen Association. In March 1944, the New York Hongmen Association convened the All-American Hongmen Relatives and Friends Conference, which decided to change the American Chee Kung Tong into the Chinese Hongmen Chee Kung Party. Its主張s were \"to realize the integrity of territorial sovereignty externally, and to abolish one-party dictatorship and realize democratic politics internally.\" In 1946, the party leader Situ Meitang returned to China and planned to organize the Hongmen Chee Kung Party in Shanghai, but was opposed by the Shanghai gangs. Situ Meitang then announced his withdrawal from the party. The current leader is Chen Qiyou.\n\n　　Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party\n\n　　The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, commonly known as the Third Party, was originally the Chinese Revolutionary Party, established in Shanghai after Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal in 1927. In January 1930, it was formally organized as a party and renamed the Provisional Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. Deng Yanda, who was killed by Chiang Kai-shek, was the leader of the party at that time. In the winter of 1933, the party leaders participated in the Fujian People's Government incident. After the failure, it was reorganized in 1935 and renamed the Chinese National Liberation Action Committee. In February 1947, it was renamed its current name. Its current political主張s are: 1. Support the Democratic League and realize democracy; 2. Struggle together with workers and peasants across the country; 3. Implement \"land to the tillers\" and improve the lives of workers and peasants; 4. Oppose the aggression of American imperialism and the civil war of aiding Chiang, and ensure China's independence and autonomy. The leaders of the party are Zhang Bojun and Peng Zemin.\n\n　　China National Salvation Association\n\n　　Since the \"September 18th Incident\" in 1931, the Chiang Kai-shek government has consistently implemented a policy of national betrayal and surrender to Japan, which has aroused the resolute opposition of the people across the country. In 1935, students in Peiping (now Beijing) took the lead and launched the great \"December 9th\" anti-Japanese movement. All parts of the country responded one after another. The Shanghai cultural circles united with all walks of life to establish the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Association. On May 30, 1936, they convened national representatives in Shanghai and established the National All-Circles National Salvation Association Federation, electing Ma Xiangbo (deceased), Shen Junru, Zou Taofen (deceased), Tao Xingzhi (deceased), Zhang Naiqi and other thirty-five people as executive members. This is the predecessor of the China National Salvation Association. The association's founding declaration responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party's \"August 1st Declaration,\" demanding immediate resistance to Japan, \"stopping all civil wars,\" and \"rapidly establishing a national united front.\" In 1936, Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, Li Gongpu, Wang Zaoshi, Zhang Naiqi, and Shi Liang were arrested and imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government for advocating unity against foreign aggression, and were known as the \"Seven Gentlemen.\" They were released after the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In 1938, Shen Junru led the organization of the National War of Resistance and National Construction Promotion Association, which was persecuted by the Kuomintang. In 1939, it restored its old name, and soon joined the United Association for National Construction and the Democratic League of Political Groups, and has always been the backbone of the Democratic League. After Japan's surrender, it changed to its current name. Since 1946, the association has consistently supported the Political Consultative Conference line and opposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' anti-people policies of dictatorship, civil war, and national betrayal. The current leaders are Shen Junru and Li Zhangda.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 几个民主党派与团体的概况\n\n1948-09-04\n第2版()\n专栏：新华社信箱\n\n　　几个民主党派与团体的概况\n    问：今年五一劳动节，我党发布了五一口号，其中第五项主张：“各民主党派、各人民团体及社会贤达，迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府”。五月五日各民主党派及团体即致电毛主席表示拥护。这些民主党派及团体的概况如何？\n    答：兹将五月五日致电毛主席拥护召开新政治协商会议的各民主党派及团体，概略介绍如下：\n    中国国民党革命委员会\n    中国国民党革命委员会于一九四八年元旦在香港正式成立。在此以前，国民党内一部分反对蒋介石独裁的党员曾脱离国民党，另树组织，先后有李济琛、蔡廷楷领导的中国国民党民主促进会，以及何香凝、柳亚子、谭平山领导的三民主义同志联合会，中国国民党革命委员会即为这两个组织及其他反蒋的国民党员如冯玉祥、朱学范等参加的统一领导机构。该委员会成立时，曾发表宣言与行动纲领，宣称：“以中国国民党第一次全国代表大会决定之对外对内政策为基本原则”，主张将联俄联共扶助工农政策扩大为“联合世界上以平等待我之民族”，“联合国内一切民主党派”及“耕者有其田”三项政策。同时主张“倒蒋”“反美”，成立民主联合政府。\n    中国民主同盟\n    中国民主同盟的前身为统一建国同志会，成立于一九四○年一月，一九四一年三月改称民主政团同盟，先后参加者有救国会、第三党（后改名中国农工民主党）、中华职业教育社、乡村建设派、东北革命同志会、国社党（后改名民社党）、青年党及个人盟员如张一岷、柳亚子、张澜等。一九四五年九月始称现名。一九四六年政协会议前，青年党投靠蒋介石，脱离民盟。翌年一月民盟二中全会将另一反动组织民社党开除。政协以来，他们主张停止内战实行政协决议，盟员闻一多、李公朴、杜斌丞均因反内战反独裁遭受蒋介石残杀。一九四六年十一月蒋介石召开伪国民大会，一九四七年春伪政府改组，他们均拒绝参加。十一月，国民党政府宣布解散民盟，十一月五日该盟主席张澜宣布民盟“自动解散”。不久，该盟另一部分领导人如沈钧儒、章伯钧、周新民等出走香港，与其南方负责人如邓初民、彭泽民、沈志远等，于一九四八年一月举行三中全会，重建领导机构，并发表宣言，提出四项主张：“一，在目前形势下，欲实现中国的和平民主，已不可能由谈判妥协求之；二，反对代表地主豪绅买办封建的整个集团，彻底实行土地改革，然后工商业才能繁荣；三，反对美国对华侵略政策，不承认对外的一切损害中国人民利益的条约；四，愿与一切民主党派合作，造成坚强的民主统一战线，中国共产党为民主之先进，其奋斗的历史，值得每个爱国的中国人敬佩，本盟愿与他们携手合作”。\n    中国民主促进会\n    中国民主促进会于一九四六年政协时期在上海成立，由上海一部分学者、作家及工业界人士组成，领导人为马叙伦、王绍鏊。一九四六年六月二十三日上海各界代表为反对内战主张和平赴宁请愿，上海民众五、六万人送至车站，当晚抵南京即被国民党特务殴伤于下关车站，其中多数代表即为中国民主促进会领导分子。\n    致公党\n    洪门为满清时反清复明之组织，太平天国革命失败后，洪门领袖杨辅清走美洲，创立洪门会。一九四四年三月纽约洪门会召开全美洲洪门恳亲大会，决议将美洲致公堂，改为中国洪门致公党。其主张为“对外实现领土主权完整，对内取消一党专政，实现民主政治。”一九四六年该党领导人司徒美堂回国，拟在上海组织洪门致公党，遭上海帮口反对，司徒美堂遂宣布脱党。现在之领导人为陈其尤。\n    中国农工民主党\n    中国农工民主党通称第三党，一九二七年蒋介石叛变后，在上海成立之中华革命党，即其最初之组织。一九三○年一月正式组党，更名为中国国民党临时行动委员会，被蒋介石杀害的邓演达，即为当时该党之领导人。一九三三年冬，该党领导人曾参加福建人民政府事变。失败后，于一九三五年改组，称为中华民族解放行动委员会。一九四七年二月又更为现名。现在其政治主张为：一、支持民盟，实现民主，二、与全国工农共同奋斗，三、实行耕者有其田，改善工农生活，四、反对美帝国主义的侵略及援蒋内战，确保中国的独立与自主。该党领导人为章伯钧、彭泽民。\n    中国人民救国会\n    自一九三一年“九一八”以来，蒋介石政府一贯执行对日投降的卖国政策，激起全国人民的坚决反对，一九三五年北平学生首先发难，掀起“一二九”伟大抗日运动，全国各地纷纷响应，上海文化界联合各界成立上海各界救国联合会，一九三六年五月三十日于上海召集全国代表，成立全国各界救国会联合会，选出马相伯（已故）、沈钧儒、邹韬奋（已故）、陶行知（已故）、章乃器等三十五人为执行委员。这便是中国人民救国会的前身。该会成立宣言响应中国共产党“八一宣言”的号召，要求立即抗日，“停止一切内战”，“迅速建立民族阵线”。一九三六年沈钧儒、邹韬奋、沙千里、李公朴、王造时、章乃器、史良因主张团结御侮，同时被蒋介石反动政府逮捕下狱，时称为“七君子”，至抗战爆发后始释出。一九三八年，沈钧儒领导组织全国抗战建国协进会，备遭国民党迫害。一九三九年又恢复旧名，不久便参加统一建国同志会及民主政团同盟，始终为民主同盟之中坚。日本投降后，始易现名。一九四六年以来，该会一贯拥护政协路线，反对国民党反动派的独裁、内战、卖国的反人民政策。现在的领导人为沈钧儒、李章达。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th -- Zhang Dexin, Acting President of Changchun University under the Kuomintang, unable to bear the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, resolved to dedicate himself to the democratic education cause in the liberated areas. On June 3rd, he and university staff member Wu Ziyi risked their lives to cross the Kuomintang military defense line, escaped from the dark and hopeless Changchun to the liberated area, and recently arrived safely in Harbin. He received a warm welcome and condolences from the democratic government and people from all walks of life along the way. At 6 p.m. on the 20th, Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Political Council, and Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman, specially held a grand welcome banquet at the Songhua River Water Club in Harbin. Nearly 200 representatives from the cultural circles of Harbin, various organizations, and representatives of the Northeast education circles attending the meeting in Harbin were invited to accompany them. In his welcome speech, Chairman Lin Feng expressed a warm welcome to Zhang's righteous action of resolutely leaving Changchun to come to the liberated area to participate in construction work. He continued: People from all walks of life with a sense of justice in the Kuomintang-ruled areas have gradually come to the liberated areas one after another. We warmly welcome such righteous actions. Now, the task at the front of the liberated area is to win battles, and the rear is for production and construction. The Northeast Liberated Area urgently needs various specialized talents and to train a large number of production and construction cadres. We sincerely hope that various experts and scholars will come and work with us to build a new Northeast and a new China. Zhang then rose to speak amidst applause. He described the Kuomintang reactionary group's destruction of education and the people of Changchun's eagerness for the Liberation Army, saying, \"They (referring to the Kuomintang reactionary group) are afraid that you will not degenerate and are most afraid of you getting close to the masses. Compared with the liberated areas, one side is truly hell and the other is heaven.\" Then he said loudly and enthusiastically: \"We must widely publicize the fact that the liberated areas warmly welcome academic talents and intellectuals to the Kuomintang-ruled areas, so that a large number of people with a sense of justice there will come to the liberated areas to participate in construction work.\"\n    Shortly after arriving in Harbin, Zhang participated in the education conference convened by the Northeast Political Council, attended every day, and actively spoke. Zhang told reporters: \"From this meeting, I can see the spirit of the comrades in the liberated areas who are working hard and diligently studying and improving. This is in sharp contrast to the perfunctory and negligent manner of the Kuomintang at education conferences.\" He said excitedly: \"Now I can also express my opinions and say what I want to say! But when I was the acting president of Changda, I couldn't say anything!\" He told reporters that on April 7, the Kuomintang army, police, secret agents, and military police in Changchun dispatched together to surround Changchun University, arresting more than 80 students, faculty, and staff. Although he was the president, he could not avoid being inspected, and even his personal letters were opened and inspected. He smiled and said, \"Now I often go to the Songhua River to swim and escape the heat, which is truly free!\" Zhang is from Huang County, Shandong Province, and graduated from Beiping Prison Affairs College. In 1931, he studied at the University of Berlin in Germany and received a doctorate in mathematics. During his studies, he participated in the Anti-Imperialist League and the Anti-Japanese Allied Association. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, he returned to China and served as a professor at Xi'an Lin University, Northwest Associated University, and Northwest Normal College, as well as the head of the Department of Mathematics. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Dean of Academic Affairs and Dean of the College of Science at Changchun University. In June last year, he became the acting president of the university. He is the author of books such as \"Introduction to Higher Mathematics.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 参加解放区建设工作　长春大学校长张德馨抵哈　林枫主席在欢迎宴会上致词　热诚欢迎各种专家学者共同建设新东北新中国\n\n1948-09-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　参加解放区建设工作\n  　长春大学校长张德馨抵哈\n  　林枫主席在欢迎宴会上致词\n  　热诚欢迎各种专家学者共同建设新东北新中国\n    【新华社东北三十日电】国民党长春大学代理校长张德馨因不堪国民党反动统治，决心献身解放区的民主教育事业，于六月三日与该校职员吴子义冒险穿越国民党军防线，逃出暗无天日的长春来解放区，于日前安抵哈市。沿途备受民主政府及各界人士之热烈欢迎与慰问。二十日下午六时，东北政委会林枫主席与高崇民副主席特假哈市松花江水上俱乐部举行盛大欢迎宴会，哈市文化界、各机关团体代表及在哈开会之东北教育界代表近二百人奉邀作陪。林枫主席在欢迎辞中对于张氏毅然离开长春来解放区参加建设工作的正义行动，表示热烈的欢迎。继说：国民党统治区具有正义感的各界人士，现在已逐渐先后来解放区，我们对于这样的正义举动，十分欢迎。现在解放区前方的任务是打胜仗，后方就是生产建设，东北解放区亟需各种专门人材，并培养大批生产建设干部，我们热诚希望各种专家学者来和我们共同建设新的东北，新的中国。张氏继于掌声中起立讲话。他叙述了国民党反动集团摧残教育的情形及长春人民切盼解放军的心情，他说：“他们（指国民党反动集团）唯恐你不堕落，最怕你接近群众。同解放区比，真是一面是地狱，一面是天堂。”接着他高声热情的说：“我们一定要把解放区如此热忱欢迎学术人材和知识分子的事实，广泛的宣传到国民党统治区去，使那里大批有正义感的人，都到解放区来参加建设工作。”\n    张氏抵哈后不久，即参加了东北政委会召开的教育会议，每日必到，并且积极发言。张氏告记者说：“从这个会议，看出了解放区教育同仁埋头苦干，努力钻研改进的作风。与国民党在教育会议上那种例行公事，因循苟且简直成一鲜明对比。”他兴奋的说：“我现在也能够发表意见，说我要说的话了！但是当我做长大代理校长时，却什么也不能说！”他告诉记者，四月七日长春的国民党军队、警察、特务、宪兵即曾一齐出动，将长春大学团团包围，捕去学生教职员八十多人，他虽身为校长，亦不免被检查，连平日来往私人信件也要被拆阅检查。他微笑说：“现在我经常到松花江去游泳避暑，真是自由自在！”张氏为山东黄县人，北平监务专门学校毕业，一九三一年留学德国柏林大学，获数学博士学位。留学期间曾参加反帝同盟和抗日同盟会。一九三七年抗战爆发后归国，历任西安临大、西北联合大学教授，及西北师范学院教授兼数学系主任。抗战胜利后任长春大学教务长兼理学院院长。去年六月任该校代理校长。曾著有“高等数学概论”等书。"

    "title": "Comrade Dong Biwu's Opening Speech at the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-04",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, August 31st: The following is an abstract of Dong Biwu's opening speech at the North China Provisional People's Representative Conference on August 7th:\n\nComrade Representatives,\n\nOur North China Provisional People's Representative Conference has now opened. It is provisional and also regional to North China. However, it will become a prelude and prototype for the National People's Congress. Therefore, it is a landmark conference in the history of the Chinese democratic revolution and will occupy a glorious chapter in the history of the Chinese democratic revolution.\n\nPeople say that the 20th century is the century of the people. Before the 20th century, history was always about a minority ruling the majority, a minority exploiting the majority. In capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie often used the democratic system as a guise to deceive the people. The democracy they talked about was the democracy of the old democracy, which in reality was still a minority ruling the majority of the people. After the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the Soviet working people overthrew the old rule, abolished the system of exploitation, and the people truly stood up, managed their own affairs, and truly realized the most thorough democracy. Afterwards, the people of various countries were influenced by the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union and rose up in revolution one after another. The people of many countries seized power and established new democratic systems. The establishment of new people's power is a political feature of the 20th century.\n\nOur current People's Representative Conference precisely fits the statement that the 20th century is the century of the people.\n\nAmerican imperialism often calls itself the \"most democratic\" country in the world. However, some universities in the United States do not even allow lectures on Darwin's theory of evolution. Black people and white people cannot only not live in the same place, but they cannot even ride in the same car, and even the white people's toilets are not allowed for black people to enter. Only a very small number of black people have the right to vote. Because black people account for the majority in Washington, the mayor has to be appointed by the government, and they dare not have him elected by the people. For example, the British election law stipulates that candidates must have a certain amount of cash as a guarantee. If the number of votes obtained does not reach the legal number, this cash will be confiscated; if the candidates cannot provide the legal cash, they cannot become candidates. Capitalist countries use these many methods to restrict and deprive the people of their democratic rights.\n\nAnd our representative conference, although temporary and regional, does not discriminate against race, belief, or gender. Not only do we have representatives of the Hui people participating in our conference, but we also have representatives of the Hui people elected to the presidium. There are many women representatives, and there is also a female chairman in the presidium. The presidium also includes representatives of workers, representatives of peasants, representatives of industrialists and businessmen, representatives of students, representatives of the army, representatives of political parties, non-party social elites, and representatives of enlightened gentry. The people's right to elect is fully respected. Our democratic system is far superior to the democratic system of capitalist countries. As for the Kuomintang reactionary ruling group's pseudo-\"National Assembly\" convened on March 29th this year, it is notorious and full of ugly behaviors, and it is not worth comparing it with our People's Representative Conference.\n\nIn the past, our liberated areas also held senates, but they were very different from this representative conference. First of all, the names are different, secondly, the composition of the members is different, and the powers of the meetings are also different.\n\nOur People's Representative Conference shows that the regime in our liberated areas is a revolutionary regime, a people's regime, and a new democratic regime. It is roughly similar to some democratic countries in Eastern Europe such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Albania. These countries solved the land problem after the war, eliminated fascism, and united to establish their people's regimes, new democratic regimes. Some of these countries have begun to embark on socialism. But as far as East Asia is concerned, it is our representative conference that has the form of a new democratic regime.\n\nNow we can hold such a People's Representative Conference, which has certain conditions. First of all, our North China Liberated Area has basically completed the land reform. People in North China who had no land or very little land in the past have now been allocated land that roughly averages the number of acres per capita in the local area; the landlord class that monopolized the land in the past no longer exists, feudal exploitation has been eliminated, the relations of production have changed, the countryside has a new look, and the peasants have obtained a basis for a better life than before. Without this condition, even if we wanted to hold such a People's Representative Conference, it would be impossible.\n\nSecondly, there is the victory of the Liberation War. The situation in the North China Liberated Area has changed in the two years of war. In the past, this vast area was divided by the enemy. But after our army victoriously controlled the Zhengtai Railway and liberated Shijiazhuang and the surrounding county towns, the area of thousands of miles in North China was completely united. Our Liu Deng, Chen Xie, and Chen Su armies went south, pushing the Liberation War to the Kuomintang-controlled areas and victoriously opening up the Central Plains Liberated Area. The victorious offensives of our Northeast, East China, Northwest, and North China North and South Line Corps made the Kuomintang bandit army completely passive. This allows our North China Liberated Area to be less affected by the war and to vigorously engage in production and construction. Without the condition of war victory, it would be impossible to hold such a People's Representative Conference. Winning this condition is the result of the efforts of all the compatriots in North China, the result of the efforts of the compatriots in the liberated areas, especially the Liberation Army commanders and fighters and the rear service personnel who worked hard and sacrificed blood. In order to commemorate the heroic martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the front and rear, I ask all the representatives of the conference to stand in silence for three minutes to express our condolences to them! (All representatives stood in silence for three minutes.) In order to express the joy of the people of North China in gaining liberation, I propose that the conference, in its name, pay sincere and warm respect to Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and the Liberation Army commanders and fighters and rear service personnel led by them! (Loud applause)\n\nThis conference will resolve the major current tasks in North China. The Jin-Chahar-Hebei Administrative Committee and the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government will report to the conference. The governments of these two regions have made their best efforts in the past war environment to lead the people to support the war, complete land reform, and achieve their historical mission. They have laid a good working foundation, which enables us to engage in broader political, economic, and cultural construction on this basis. Of course, North China has not completely gotten rid of the impact of the war, and all kinds of construction should still focus on supporting the war and striving for victory. Therefore, at this conference, we must formulate the future government's policies, discuss the work reports of the two border region governments, some basic policies, the organization of the new government, and the proposals of the government and representatives. These tasks must be completed within the schedule set by the conference.

    "content": "[Jinzhong News] \"The factory is the life of us workers. We depend on motors and steel mills for our livelihood, and we cannot allow Yan's bandits to destroy it. Whoever tries to destroy it will be beaten back with iron bars!\" This was the just and firm cry from the workers of the electric light factory and flour mill in Pingyao when our People's Liberation Army approached the city. On May 11th, the Yan bandits in the city, fearing annihilation by our forces, abandoned the city and fled at midnight. At this time, the workers were very happy. First, the day they had been waiting for day and night had arrived; second, the enemy did not have time to destroy the factory. However, there were still remnants of the enemy in the city. The workers closed the gates and held a meeting to discuss how to deal with the remaining enemies and protect the factory. Some of the workers were deceived by Yan's bandits' propaganda and were uneasy, fearing that our army would carry out \"thirty-six killings\" upon arrival. Yang Fuwei, an electrical worker, immediately exposed these absurd claims of Yan's bandits, and those few people felt relieved. Han Junde, the head of the engineering section who came from a working-class background, firmly stated, \"The machines are ours, and we must protect them well. We will welcome the People's Liberation Army when they enter, and if a few enemies come to destroy our factory, we will beat them out with iron bars!\" He repeated these encouraging words to those few fearful workers, saying, \"I will open the door, I will make contact. If there are killings, kill me first.\" This further reassured them, and they continued to work on sending electricity as usual. At eight o'clock in the morning on the 12th, seven Yan puppet soldiers came, holding guns and calling at the door. The workers thought it was the People's Liberation Army. When they went out and saw that it was not the People's Liberation Army, Han Junde refused to let them into the factory. They demanded fifty bags of foreign flour. Han Junde gave them ten bags of flour and sent them away. At nine o'clock, more than a hundred suspicious people came, looking fierce, and insisted on entering the factory. All the workers immediately mobilized urgently, preparing to resist. Yang Fuwei said to the enemy, \"This is a factory, our rice bowl. If you destroy it, how will we live? When the People's Liberation Army comes, how will we explain it? Who will take responsibility?\" The workers said angrily in unison, \"We rely on this factory to eat! When the Liberation Army comes, the factory will belong to the people. Whoever dares to make trouble will be beaten out!\" Seeing that the situation was not good, these suspicious guys turned around and left. The workers were extremely anxious. Just then, the People's Liberation Army entered the city. Han Junde quickly went to the army to make contact and reported to County Chief Lu of the democratic government that the factory's machines were undamaged and that there were still 130,000 catties of white flour milled. The factory was still operating. County Chief Lu immediately praised their contribution to protecting the factory and proposed that everyone be reinstated at their original positions and salaries to work with peace of mind. Han Junde told everyone this, and they were overjoyed. They immediately proposed to help the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government quickly restore order in the city, providing electricity all night for three nights to ensure bright lights, so that the staff could work well. The electrical workers Lin Weizhi and Yan Dehua went to the democratic municipal government, the municipal committee, and the army organs and repaired more than two hundred light bulbs in a row, and helped the telephone bureau set up the wires. The reporter visited the Pingyao Power Plant and the steel mill and saw that all the factory equipment was intact. The flour mill workers and electric light workers were all working actively.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-04",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【Taihang Dispatch】In order to resolve civil disputes among the masses through consultation, the Pingshun County Government has emphasized mediation in judicial work, which has yielded significant results. This approach has proven to be highly suitable for the current rural situation. As a result of the large-scale production campaign and the completion of land reform in recent years, people's lives have improved and their awareness has increased, leading to a significant reduction in criminal cases. However, due to the relatively dispersed nature of land and property, the relationships between farmers have become more complex than before (such as jointly dividing houses and land, jointly using toilets, and jointly feeding livestock), and farmers are constantly experiencing some new disputes in their daily lives. According to a survey of several villages in the fourth, fifth, and seventh districts: in the past six months, there have been 88 disputes over jointly feeding livestock, 20 disputes over jointly using toilets, 38 disputes over land boundaries, 19 disputes over courtyards, and 15 disputes over jointly using farm implements. There have also been some debt disputes arising from cooperative production and jointly purchasing livestock. This is one of the main contents of the current judicial mediation work. After the masses were emancipated, they demanded to establish families and careers, and the broad masses of women demanded liberation, family democracy, gender equality, and freedom of marriage. Therefore, there are also many disputes over marriage relations and family issues in rural areas. According to statistics from five districts in half a year, there were 251 divorce and contract termination cases, which is another important content of judicial mediation work. If these problems can be properly resolved, it will have a positive effect on strengthening mass unity and promoting production. The sixth district of Pingshun has made remarkable achievements in mediation work. Within one month, 116 various disputes occurred in the district, of which 71 have been resolved by the village mediation committees (including 18 cases of family discord, 14 cases of quarrels, 8 cases of fights, 6 cases of wage issues, 6 cases of jointly feeding livestock, 6 cases of petty theft, 3 cases of land boundary disputes, and 10 other cases). By understanding the thoughts, distinguishing right from wrong, and resolving disputes fairly and reasonably in mediation, both parties can be satisfied and achieve unity in production. For example, Shi Menze, a mother-in-law in Ku＠ Village, had disagreements with her daughter-in-law and requested a separation. During the mediation, it was learned that there were often sick people in her family, and it would be more difficult to separate the family. Immediately grasping this point, they repeatedly persuaded her, and she was convinced after being explained to. The mother immediately said: \"You are right. I will not be angry in the future. The more angry I get, the more difficult it will be.\" Her daughter-in-law also began to change her mind at this time: it would be more difficult to have children without help if the family was separated, and family discord would not benefit her at all. Therefore, not only did she not ask for a separation, but she also proposed to respect her mother-in-law and work hard to unite and produce. In order to strengthen this mediation work, the county decided on the following guidelines and specific practices for the future: (1) Except for major cases, civil disputes should be resolved by the village mediation committees as much as possible. As the saying goes, \"A year of litigation is ten years of injustice.\" The current democratic government is certainly not the yamen of the past, but if things are brought to the village government, the ideological emotions of both parties will form further opposition. If it is brought to the district or county level, it will be even more wasteful of manpower and money, increase grievances, and sometimes it will not be a matter of solving the problem, but simply forming the phenomenon of \"selling the land in front of the hall to fight for a breath.\" Therefore, it is very important to promote farmers to resolve disputes themselves. (2) Restore and transform the past mediation organizations in order to resolve problems in a timely and reasonable manner. The village chief should be the chairman of the committee, the civil affairs director should be the vice chairman, and then some villagers who have prestige, are selfless, and are good at mediating disputes should be elected to jointly form the mediation committee and carry out mediation work in conjunction with production. Problems related to each system can be jointly resolved with the responsible cadres of each system. For example, women's cadres should participate in solving women's issues. (3) Mediation work is a social work and an ideological education work. If all disputes between farmers are resolved well, it will remove obstacles to the central work and make the production movement a victorious one. This is the sole purpose of mediation work. Therefore, when mediating each problem, it must be combined with mobilizing the masses to carry out ideological education for the large-scale production movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平顺为加强农民团结生产　民事纠纷着重调解\n\n1948-09-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平顺为加强农民团结生产\n  　民事纠纷着重调解\n    【太行电】为了以协商方式解决群众间的民事纠纷，平顺县府强调在司法工作中实行调解，收效很大。证明这种办法，非常适合当前农村中的实际情况。几年来开展大生产运动与完成了土地改革的结果，人民生活改善，觉悟提高，刑事案件大大减少，但因土地财产相对分散，农民相互间的关系较前复杂（如伙分房子土地，伙用厕所，伙喂牲口等），农民在日常生活中不断发生一些新的纠纷。据四、五、七三个区几个村庄调查：近半年来发生伙喂牲口纠纷八十八件，伙用厕所纠纷二十件，争地界纠纷三十八件，争房院纠纷十九件，伙使农具纠纷十五件。还发生了一些因合伙生产、伙买牲口而产生的债务纠纷。这是目前司法调解工作的主要内容之一。群众翻身后要求成家立业，广大妇女要求解放，要求家庭民主，男女平等，婚姻自由，因此农村中婚姻关系、家庭问题等纠纷也很多。据五个区半年内统计，离婚解约案件达二百五十一件，这是司法调解工作的另一重要内容。这些问题如能适当解决，对加强群众团结，推动生产将会发生良好效果。平顺六区在调解工作上已做出显著成绩。一个月内全区发生各种纠纷一百一十六件，已经各村调解委员会调解结束的有七十一件（计家庭不和十八件，吵嘴十四件，打架八件，工资问题六件，伙喂牲口六件，小偷六件，争地界三件，其他十件）。在调解中揣摸心思、分清是非，公平合理解决，就能取得双方满意，达到团结生产。如库＠村石门则婆媳不和，要求分家，调解时了解了他家里经常有病人，分开家实际困难会更多。当即抓住这点，多方劝告，一经解释就说通了。当娘的当场就说：“你们讲的对，我以后可不生气啦，过时光越生气越困难”。她儿媳这时也想转了：分开家生下小孩无人帮助，更困难，家庭不和对自己没有一点好处。因此不但不要求分家，还提出要尊重婆婆，好好团结生产。该县为了加强这种调解工作，决定今后方针与具体作法：（一）民间除重大案件外，尽量由各村调解委员会解决。俗话说：“一年官司十年冤”，现在的民主政府当然不是过去的衙门，但事情闹到了村政府，双方的思想情绪就会形成进一步的对立，如再闹到区上、县上，越发劳民伤财，增加冤气，甚至有时就变成不是解决问题，而单纯形成“为了争口气，卖了堂前地”的现象，所以发扬农民自己起来调解纠纷，非常重要。（二）恢复与改造过去的调解组织，以求及时合理解决问题。应以村长为主任委员，民事主任为副主任委员，再民选一些土改生产运动中有威信、大公无私、善于调解纠纷的群众，共同组成调委会，结合生产进行调解工作。和各系统有关的问题，可会同各系统负责干部共同解决。如妇女问题即要让妇女干部参加解决。（三）调解工作是一件社会工作，是一件思想教育工作，农民间发生的一切纠纷如果解决的好，就会扫除中心工作的障碍，使生产运动胜利开展，这是调解工作的唯一目的。因此在调解每一个问题时，就必须与发动群众进行大生产运动的思想教育结合起来。"

The process of their work is introduced as follows:\n    The first difficulty encountered was the disunity of cadres. The main cadres of Dongying Village were all old cadres who were reinstated after rectification. For example, Feng Xiaofu, the former chairman of the Farmers' Association and current security officer, said: \"We can't even get the representatives to a meeting. We used to move their stones, but how did they move ours back then?\" The work team held a meeting of cadres to resolve the contradictions, and then overcome the cadres' fear of delaying production. Cadres in Xi'an Village said: \"We are so busy now, the crops are so high, and issuing land certificates requires measuring the land, which is impossible.\" However, the masses had long been looking forward to the issuance of land certificates, so they approached the cadres and said: \"If our village doesn't do it, the county and district cadres will go to other villages.\" The work team also explained the important relationship between issuing land certificates and developing production. Under this persuasion from above and below, the cadres' thinking changed.\n    Secondly, publicize and mobilize, and establish a land committee. The Dongying Land Committee, under the leadership of the Farmers' Representative Conference, is chaired concurrently by Feng Youza, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, and has four sections: publicity, surveying, evaluation, and secretariat. The publicity section posted notices, convened mass meetings, explained the significance and methods of issuing land certificates, and solicited opinions from the masses. After the meeting, there were many discussions, and the notice was surrounded by viewers, with the middle peasants being the most active. The twenty mu of land left over from the equal distribution, no one wanted it at first, but now many people came to ask for it. The middle peasant Li Xiaowen said that he worked hard and was willing to have a few mu of land. In addition to giving him four mu, the Land Committee distributed the rest to poor and hired peasants with labor power.\n    Third, combine rectification with yield assessment and distribute land certificates. Some of the yields set during the equal distribution of land were unreasonable and not based on the geological output. Under the one-sided idea that poor peasants should take advantage of everything, and in order for the poor peasants to bear less burden, some yields were determined according to class status. For example, a piece of land belonging to the middle peasant Qiu Xiao in Xi'an Village was sandwiched between the land of two poor peasants. Because he worked well and harvested more grain, and the soil quality was the same, his yield was set as first class, while the adjacent land was set as second class. This time, the unfairness was completely corrected based on soil quality and yield. Then it was reviewed and approved at the group meeting, and then submitted to the Land Committee for registration and listing, soliciting opinions, and correcting errors.\n    Hand over old documents and issue land certificates. The main thing was to break the orthodox ideology. Some said: \"These old deeds have not been changed for so many years, and whoever comes along honors them.\" Many people said that they had no documents, and some took out a few and kept a few, always reluctant to hand them over. After repeated explanations and mutual discussions, their thinking was changed, and they handed them over. Xi'an Village finally held a village meeting, announcing the end of the equal distribution, that all past red and white documents and contracts were null and void, and that everything would be done according to the new land certificates. It called on everyone to produce well in the future and get rich.\n\n    Editor's note: The biggest shortcomings in Luancheng's issuance of land certificates are abandoning the branch and failing to resolve the unity of the new and old cadres. The Xi'an Village material said: \"The cadres in this village are not responsible for each other, and the branch is not functioning... In order to work well, a land committee was established.\" It also said: \"Various organizations were not well utilized to complete this work.\" The Dongying work team said: \"In the work, the cadres made the mistake of being eager for quick success, and failed to grasp the handling of cadre problems as soon as they arrived in the village, so the work was not very smooth from beginning to end.\" Without relying on the branch and resolving the unity of the new and old cadres, the branch will never function, the cadre problem will always exist, and once the work team leaves, all work will be impossible to carry out. The role of the branch and the cadre problem must be further improved and resolved in every specific work. Otherwise, it is repeating the mistake of \"abandoning the old organization.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 确定地权，发展生产　栾城开始发土地证\n\n1948-09-04\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　确定地权，发展生产\n  　栾城开始发土地证\n    【本报讯】栾城县委派往西安庄与东营村的工作组，现已完成颁发土地证工作。兹将其工作经过，介绍如下：\n    首先遇到的困难问题，是干部不团结。东营村主要干部都是纠偏后复职的老干部，如前任农会主任现任治安员冯小赋说：“代表们开会叫不到，咱们就搬他们的石头，怎么那时候他们搬咱们哩。”工作组召开了干部会，解决矛盾，接着打通干部怕耽误生产的思想。西安庄干部说：“现在这么忙，庄稼这么高，发土地证还得量地，那可没法做”。而群众早就盼着发土地证，即找干部说：咱村要不做，人家县区干部就到别的村去了。工作组也说明发土地证对于发展生产重要关系。在这种上下劝说之下，干部思想才转变过来。\n    其次，宣传动员，建立土地委员会。东营土地委员会在农代会领导下，主任由农会主任冯右杂兼任，下设宣传、丈量、评议、秘书四股。宣传股张贴布告，召开群众大会，说明发土地证的意义与办法，征求群众的意见。会后议论纷纷，布告被观众包围了起来，中农最为活跃。平分时剩下的二十亩地，没有人要，现在好多人来问，中农李小稳说自己劳动多，愿意要几亩地，土委会除给他四亩外，其余的都分给了有劳动力的贫雇农。\n    第三、结合纠偏评产量，分发土地证。平分土地时定的产量有的不合理，没有根据地质产量来定，在贫农什么也得占便宜的片面思想支持下，为了贫农少拿负担，有的竟按成份定产量。如西安庄中农秋小的一块地，夹在两个贫农的地中间，因他劳动好，粮食打的多，土质都是一样，但产量定为一等，邻地定为二等。这次根据土质产量，将不公平的完全纠正过来。接着在小组会上审查通过，然后交土地委员会登记列榜，征求意见，修正错误。\n    交出旧文书，发给土地证。主要的是打破正统思想，有的说：“这么多年老契都没有换过，什么人过来都顶事。”很多人都说没文书了，有的拿出几张，留下几张，总是不愿交出来。经过反复解释与互相酝酿，打通了思想，才交出来。西安庄最后开了一个村民大会，宣布平分结束，过去红白文书契约一律作废，按新土地证办事。号召今后好好生产，发财致富。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    编者按：栾城发土地证中最大的缺点是抛开支部，以及没有解决新老干部的团结问题。西安庄材料说：“这个村干部互不负责，支部也不起作用………为了很好工作，才建立了一个土地委员会”。又说：“没有很好利用各种组织来完成此工作”。东营工作组说：“工作中干部犯了急于求成，一到村未抓住干部问题的处理，工作从始到终不很顺利。”不依靠支部，不解决新老干部团结问题，支部永不起作用，干部问题永远存在，工作组一走，一切工作无从进行。支部作用，干部问题，必须在每一件具体工作中进一步的提高与解决。否则就是重复了“抛开老组织”的错误。"

    "content": "[Jinzhong News] The democratic governments of Qixian and Yuci counties correctly implement the lenient policy towards Yan's puppet military officers and civil servants. When Qixian city was first liberated, many Yan's puppet personnel were afraid to approach us due to the deceptive propaganda of the Yan bandits. The democratic government implements a lenient policy towards puppet soldiers, personnel of puppet political organs, and special agents who lay down their weapons. More than 700 officers and soldiers of the People's Self-Defense Army who were captured were released on the spot and sent home. Puppet government and economic organ cadres captured on the battlefield were released after investigation, allowing them to continue to keep documents and materials and hand them over to the democratic government. Eight section-level cadres of the puppet government, deeply feeling the leniency of the democratic government, led the original organ personnel to report schedules to our city defense organs, clear materials, and explain relationships. More than 400 people from the puppet army and puppet family members have registered with us continuously. We adopt a policy of not arresting or capturing personnel from the puppet Jin-Cha (Jinzhong-Chahar) system, from bureau chiefs and police station chiefs downwards. Fan Wei Niu, the leader of the special police team of Yan Bandit's Comrades Association, was initially afraid of being killed. During martial law, he jumped over the city wall and ran to Nanxi Village. However, when our army lifted martial law and opened the city gates, he automatically returned to the city and registered with the democratic government. The person in charge of the county branch of Yan Bandit's Comrades Association also registered with the democratic government after the Zhao Chengshou group was completely annihilated and recognized the lenient policy of our army. After the liberation of Yuci, the democratic government treated puppet army and puppet organization personnel who stopped resisting and were unwilling to flee with Yan Bandit with leniency, protecting their lives and safety. Up to now, 1,166 people have registered with the democratic government, including more than 380 field grade officers such as the puppet Eighth Column Commander, Chief of Staff, Deputy Commander, Military Hospital Director, and school-level officers from the Provisional 45th Division and the 7th Security Regiment. After talks, they voluntarily surrendered many weapons, ammunition, and supplies. The process by which Li Shusheng, a major staff officer of the puppet Yuci Security Command, broke away from the Yan bandit group and registered with the democratic government to start a new life, can represent the common psychology of ordinary Yan puppet personnel: He was originally a surplus officer of Yan Bandit's 19th Army. After Japan surrendered, he returned to Taiyuan with his family and served as a major staff officer of the Eighth Column. When he received Yan Bandit's retreat order on the night of the 19th of last month, he was discussing with his wife at home: Following the Yan Bandit army back to Taiyuan, they would not be able to make a living, and they would soon become prisoners. If they didn't follow, they were afraid that the People's Liberation Army would enter the city and kill them. At this time, he remembered that the People's Liberation Army had sent back two wounded battalion commanders and company commanders of the puppet Ninth Column during the day, and all his fear disappeared. While his family was arguing fiercely, the People's Liberation Army had already entered the city. His family changed into civilian clothes and hid. Wang Qin Zheng, a deputy commander of the Yan army who lived not far from him, also changed his name and hid. Under the influence of the democratic government's lenient policy, they initially took a tentative attitude to register with the democratic government. However, when he remembered that the People's Liberation Army staff had been to his courtyard twice and had not touched anything in his house, he finally dispelled the ghost stories told by Yan Xishan, the warlord, that the People's Liberation Army abused and killed prisoners. He voluntarily told the democratic government his true position and asked to atone for his crimes. He said: \"I am willing to be a free citizen in the liberated area, and I am no longer willing to be a reactionary pawn for the local emperor Yan Xishan.\" (Chun Dian, Bing Ru)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 祁县榆次伪员深感我军宽大　自动交出弹药物资\n春甸　冰如\n1948-09-04\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　祁县榆次伪员深感我军宽大\n  　自动交出弹药物资\n    【晋中讯】祁县、榆次两县民主政府，正确执行对阎伪军官职员的宽大政策。祁县城甫告解放时，不少阎伪人员因受阎匪欺骗宣传影响，尚不敢向我接近。民主政府对于放下武器之伪军、伪政民机关人员及特工人员一律执行宽大政策，被俘的七百余名民卫军官兵，当场释放回家，在战场上俘获之伪政府及经济机关干部，经查明后，即予释放，让他们继续保管文件物资，向民主政府移交。伪政府八名科级干部深感民主政府之宽大，率领原机关人员向我城防机关呈报表册，清理物资，交待关系。伪军伪属人员连续向我登记者，已达四百余人。对于伪晋察人员，从局长、派出所长以下，我均采取不捕不俘政策。阎匪同志会特警组长范卫牛，最初怕杀，在戒严期间，跳城跑至南席村，但当我军解除戒严开放城门后，他又自动返回城来，向民主政府登记。阎匪同志会县分会负责人，于赵承绶集团被全部歼灭，认清我军宽大政策后，也向民主政府登记。榆次解放后，民主政府对于停止抵抗，不愿跟阎匪逃窜的伪军伪组织人员，一律宽大对待，保护其生命安全。刻向民主政府登记者已达一一六六人，其中有伪八总队团长、参谋长、副团长、军医院长及暂四十五师、保七团等校级军官三百八十余人，经过谈话后，彼等自动交出武器弹药物资很多。伪榆次保安司令部少校参谋李树生脱离阎匪集团向民主政府登记自新的过程，可以代表一般阎伪人员的共同心理：他原系阎匪十九军编余军官，日本投降后，带着眷属随阎匪回了太原，任八总队少校参谋，当他上月十九日夜接到阎匪撤退命令时，正和老婆在家里商量：跟着阎匪军回到太原，生活顾不住，不久也就要当俘虏。不跟走又怕解放军进城杀头。这时他想起解放军在白天送回伪九总队两个负伤的营长和连长的事情，顿时消失了一切恐惧。一家人正在激剧的争辩，解放军已经入城了，他一家人便换上便衣，隐藏起来。和他住得不远的一个阎军副团长王勤政，改名换姓，也隐蔽起来。他们在民主政府宽大政策的感召下，起初还抱着试探态度去民主政府登记，但当他想起解放军工作人员去他院内两次，都没有动他家里任何东西时，终于最后打消了阎匪锡山所说解放军虐杀俘虏的鬼话，自动向民主政府说出真实的职位，并且要求立功赎罪。他说：“我愿意在解放区当一个自由的公民，不愿再给土皇帝阎锡山做反动的走卒了”。（春甸、冰如）"

That afternoon, they went to the headquarters to congratulate Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai and Deputy Commanders Zhang Zongxun and Zhao Shoushan on the great victory of annihilating the 36th Division and express their condolences. Deputy Commander Peng also expressed his heartfelt thanks for the help and support of the party, government, military, civilians, students, and working cadres and people in the new areas in the rear; he was very concerned about the production and disaster relief situation in the rear. Labor hero Yang Buhao happily said: \"The disaster caused by the Hu bandits has passed after everyone's hard work in production. After the wheat harvest, we are also eating melons, vegetables and red bean pods. This year's autumn rain is strong, and after the autumn harvest, the disaster will completely pass, and we can look forward to a good life of abundance and sufficient food and clothing year after year.\" The representatives had a lively conversation with the leaders for more than an hour before leaving. The Northwest People's Liberation Army's headquarters and political organs held a grand welcoming party to welcome the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui All Circles慰問团. At the meeting, the representatives of the慰問团 recited the慰問 speech, and Wang Weizhou, the head of the慰問团, on behalf of the seven million people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Liberated Area, presented a red banner decorated with a lighthouse pattern to Deputy Commander Peng Dehuai of the Field Army.

Yang Mingxuan, vice chairman of the慰問团, specifically stated in his speech that the government is currently focusing on two things: mobilizing soldiers who have taken leave and not returned and deserters to return to the team, and giving preferential treatment to military families, encouraging frontline commanders and fighters to fight with peace of mind. Zhang Shulin, chairman of the Yan'an City Chamber of Commerce, described that the industry and commerce of Yan'an City have recovered to the pre-war situation, and the number of industrial and commercial operators in the city has reached 867.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st - Reports from all sources: The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, attended by representatives from 46 countries, opened on August 25th in Wrocław (formerly German Breslau), western Poland. On the first day, the congress unanimously elected six people to the presidium: France's Curie, Soviet Union's Fadeyev, Britain's Huxley, Poland's Bolesław, Italy's Guttuso, and Denmark's Norregaard. Chairman Curie then announced the congress agenda as follows: 1. Fadeyev's report: Science and culture in the struggle for peace, progress, and democracy. 2. Stapleton's report on peace and culture. 3. Harasimowicz's report: On the freedom of national cultures. 4. Belyayev's report: On international cultural cooperation. After listening to the above four reports and a recorded message from Wallace to the congress, the congress began a heated discussion. Huxley and Taylor, the head of the British delegation, under the instruction of the British Foreign Office, attempted to sabotage the congress and waited for an opportunity to withdraw. In the August 27th congress discussion, Huxley and Taylor launched attacks against Fadeyev's report. Taylor even vigorously defended the Marshall Plan in his speech, praising it for \"saving the whole world.\" Taylor's speech was met with a powerful rebuttal from Soviet representative Ehrenburg. Ehrenburg's fiery speech repeatedly won thunderous applause from the audience. He denounced the war-mongers' slogan of \"defending Western culture.\" He said: \"All culture is threatened by the pseudo-civilization engaged in an anti-European crusade.\" Brazilian writer Amado, Italian representative D'Onini, and Spanish representative and former Republican Prime Minister Giral all emphasized the anti-people essence of the so-called \"culture\" of imperialism, and condemned the cultural figures who sold themselves to American imperialism. American representative Rocky claimed: \"The British people who support Roosevelt's policies have not changed,\" and pointed out that Wallace's Progressive Party is increasingly increasing its influence in the struggle against American fascist protectors. The congress delegates listened with great interest to the speeches of representatives from colonial and dependent countries and decided to stand with the people of all countries fighting for independence.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd - The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, which began on August 25th in Wrocław, concluded on August 28th. Amidst thunderous cheers and applause, the congress passed the Declaration in Defense of Peace by an overwhelming majority. Only 16 votes from the US and British delegations (a total of 74 votes) opposed or abstained, and one vote from the Brazilian delegation abstained. The declaration first pointed out that human culture is facing a major threat. The culture of European countries, which have made significant contributions to the treasure trove of human culture, is in danger of losing its national characteristics and becoming a fascist slave. Science is being used by war instigators for the purpose of destruction. It advocates: the free development and dissemination of the achievements of progressive culture, mutual understanding between cultures and nations, and the application of science to reduce the poverty, ignorance, disease, and deprivation of the majority of mankind. The declaration pointed out that the people of the world have enough strength to defend peace and culture, and to oppose all attempts at neo-fascism, and called on intellectuals to fight for the above purposes. The declaration finally suggested: all countries should convene national congresses of cultural workers in defense of peace, establish national committees in defense of peace, and strengthen the international connections of cultural workers in all countries for the benefit of peace. The congress decided to establish an International Liaison Committee in Paris, with Soviet Fadeyev (famous writer), Fedoseyev, American Robeson (famous black singer), Fiest (editor of the American \"Mainstream\" magazine), Chilean Neruda (famous poet), French Aragon (famous poet), Madame Curie (famous physicist), Republican Spanish Giral (former prime minister, political commentator), and Polish Dąbrowski as members. Before the closing ceremony, the congress continued its debate. Hayden, a famous British scientist and popularizer of science, stated: \"We must resist the reactionary elements' attempt to divide culture into so-called Western culture and Eastern culture. We must block the spread of promises and slanders about the Soviet Union.\" He pointed out: \"The threat of a new war comes from the US imperialist bloc.\" The speeches of some British and American representatives, especially the speech of Huxley, the head of the British delegation who had attempted to slander the Soviet Union, aroused widespread indignation. Soviet representative Zaslavsky rebutted such speeches, and he denounced the persecution of intellectuals in certain countries. Zaslavsky called: \"I wish that all of us will unite in our hatred of imperialism, fascism, and war-mongers. We believe in peace and friendship among all peoples, and will strive to achieve it.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd - TASS News: Viktorov, an observer of Pravda, recently wrote an article commenting on the World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, saying: The World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace, held in Wrocław, Poland, has rightfully attracted the attention of all freedom-loving people. The representatives attending the congress exposed the reactionary plans of American imperialists at home and abroad. This feverish activity of the imperialist camp does not indicate their strength, but rather their weakness. The forces of democracy have greatly surpassed the forces of reaction. However, one must not conclude from this that one can take a passive attitude towards the plans of war-mongers and demagogues who poison the minds of the people. No, a thousand times no! Cultural workers must actively fight against reactionaries, fascism, and new wars. The Wrocław Congress is an event of international significance. It vividly demonstrates the unity of democratic forces throughout the world and the will of the people of all countries to demand peace and fight for peace.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 世界文化工作者保卫和平大会　通过保卫和平宣言　表现了进步文化对反动分子斗争的胜利\n\n1948-09-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　世界文化工作者保卫和平大会\n  　通过保卫和平宣言\n  　表现了进步文化对反动分子斗争的胜利\n    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：有四十六国代表参加的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会已于八月二十五日起在波兰西部罗克劳（前德属布累斯劳）城开幕，大会第一日一致选出：法国居里，苏联法捷耶夫，英国赫胥黎，波兰包列伊萨，意大利古图卓与丹麦诺埃特等六人为主席团。主席居里随即宣布大会议事日程如下：一、法捷耶夫报告：在争取和平、进步与民主斗争中的科学与文化。二、斯达普列顿报告论和平与文化。三、哈拉辛斯基报告：论民族文化的自由。四、伯利南报告：论国际文化合作。大会在继续听取完毕上述四个报告，并于听取华莱士致大会的录音信后展开热烈讨论。英国代表团团长赫胥黎及泰乐等在英国外交部的指令下企图破坏大会，并待机退出大会。在二十七日的大会讨论中，赫胥黎和泰乐对法捷耶夫的报告横施攻击，泰乐甚至在发言中为马歇尔计划大肆辩护，并歌颂它“拯救着全世界”。泰乐发言遭到了苏联代表爱伦堡的有力抨击。爱伦堡炽热的演说不断博得了全场雷动的掌声，他痛斥战争贩子关于“保卫西方文化”的口号。他说：“全部文化都为从事于反欧洲十字军的伪文明所威胁。”巴西作家阿玛多，意大利代表杜尼尼，西班牙代表前共和政府总理吉拉尔等都着重指出帝国主义所谓“文化”的反人民的实质，并斥责向美帝国主义卖身投靠的文化界分子。美国代表罗基声称：“拥护罗斯福政策的英国人民没有改变”，并指出华莱士的进步党在反对美国法西斯庇护者之斗争中正日益增加其影响。大会代表以热切的兴趣听取殖民地与附属国代表的发言，并决定与为独立而战的各国人民站在一起。\n    【新华社陕北三日电】自八月二十五日起在罗克劳城举行的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会已于二十八日宣告闭幕。大会在雷动的欢呼与掌声中以绝大多数通过了保卫和平宣言，仅美英两国代表团（共七十四票）中，有十六票反对与弃权，巴西代表团有一票弃权。宣言首先指陈人类文化正面临重大威胁，对人类文化宝库曾有重大贡献的欧洲各国，其文化正处于丧失民族特性而沦为法西斯奴仆的危险境遇中，科学正被战争挑拨者用于毁灭的目的，并主张：自由发展与传布进步文化之成就、文化间与民族间的相互谅解、科学应用于减少大多数人类的贫困、愚昧、疾病与匮乏。宣言指出：世界人民具有足够力量来保卫和平与文化，而反对新法西斯主义的各种企图，并呼吁知识分子为上述目的而奋斗。宣言最后建议：一切国家召开全国文化工作者保卫和平大会，成立保卫和平全国委员会，并为和平的利益而加强一切国家文化工作者的国际联系。大会决定在巴黎设立国际联络委员会，由苏联法捷耶夫（名作家）、菲多塞夫，美国罗伯逊（黑人歌王）、费斯特（美国“主流”杂志编辑），智利尼鲁达（名诗人），法国阿拉贡（名诗人）、居里女士（名物理学家），共和西班牙吉拉尔（前总理、政论家），波兰董布罗夫斯基任委员。闭幕之前，大会继续辩论。英国著名科学家与通俗化工作者海登声称：“我们必须对抗反动分子划分文化为所谓西方文化与东方文化的企图，我们必须阻塞关于苏联的诺言与诽谤之散布”。他指出：“新战争的威胁是来自美帝国主义集团”。若干英美代表，特别是曾企图诋毁苏联的英国代表团长赫胥黎的演讲，激起了普遍的愤慨。苏联代表萨斯拉夫斯基曾对这种演讲予以反击，他痛斥某些国家之迫害知识分子。萨氏呼吁：“我愿我们大家将在我们对帝国主义、法西斯主义与战争贩子的憎恨中团结起来。我们相信和平与各国人民的友谊，并将奋力以求。”\n    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社讯：真理报观察家维克托罗夫顷撰文评论世界文化工作者保卫和平大会称：在波兰罗克劳城举行的世界文化工作者保卫和平大会，已正当地引起了一切爱好自由人民的注意。出席大会的代表们揭露了美帝国主义者在国内外的反动计划。帝国主义阵营这种热病似的活动不是说明他们强大，而是说明他们衰弱。民主力量已大大超过了反动力量。但是，决不能就此得出结论，认为可以对毒害人民心灵的战争贩子与愚民主义者计划，抱消极态度。不能，一千个不能！文化工作者要积极进行战斗，反对反动派、法西斯主义和新战争。罗克劳大会是具有国际意义的事件，它生动地证明了全世界民主力量的团结与各国人民要求和平与为和平而斗争的意志。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-05",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st. The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled \"Protect State Property, Protect Public Property,\" stating:\n\n　　Our liberated areas now have large cities, large industries, and railways. Our state property and public property have greatly increased. This is a huge historical change in the development of the Chinese revolution. Because of this change, the revolutionary war can victoriously transition to today's large-scale offensive situation. The editorial continued: All state property and public property are the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people, and are a huge wealth of the nation. If these assets are in the hands of counter-revolutionaries, they will become tools for oppressing and exploiting the people and supporting counter-revolutionary wars; but if they are in the hands of revolutionary people, they will become tools for safeguarding the people's interests, raising the people's living standards, and supporting revolutionary wars. They are so crucial to the success or failure of the revolutionary war!\n\n　　The editorial recalled the difficult conditions during the ten years of civil war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, stating: At that time, we did not have large cities, large industries, or railways. We relied solely on the unyielding efforts of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to organize the economic strength of agriculture and handicrafts in the countryside and carry out long-term and arduous guerrilla warfare. At that time, we tasted the bitterness of \"no industry, no cities\" and suffered all kinds of hardships. At that time, we all thought that if we ever had these things, we must cherish them, use them well, and rely on them to overthrow the rule of the counter-revolutionaries.\n\n　　The editorial pointed out that, unfortunately, many places and many comrades have not paid good attention to and implemented the protection of state property and public property. Especially in newly recovered areas, some people searching for scrap metal have \"collected\" complete lathes, boilers, and engines, making originally complete factories incomplete; in some places, when electrical materials are particularly scarce, some factories are even allowed to buy electric wires to melt and cast spittoons and washbasins, saying that this is \"developing industrial production\"; some places regard rails as scrap iron and sleepers as fuel, completely forgetting how much we currently need these materials for railway construction. In the old areas, after much education and struggle, the above phenomena are much less, but there are still chronic destructive and wasteful phenomena. In individual places, factories have caught fire carelessly, and huge amounts of grain have been wasted. Such damage and waste of state property and public property is a vicious enemy in the new democratic economic construction. To tolerate and condone these phenomena, and to turn a blind eye to them, is tantamount to committing a crime against the revolutionary cause.\n\n　　The editorial pointed out that the main ideological causes of these phenomena are the guerrilla habits, localism, and narrow financial viewpoints developed over a long period in a decentralized, rural, and guerrilla warfare environment, so that when dealing with state property and public property, there is no overall concept, no unified concept, and no planned concept. As a result, they unconsciously damage the overall interests for the sake of the local interests of their own units. Furthermore, the reflection of some non-proletarian ideas—the disorganization, destructiveness, and selfishness of small producers, and the extravagance of playboys who do not work for a living—in the revolutionary ranks has aggravated these destructive and wasteful phenomena. Therefore, the protection of state property and public property must be achieved through serious ideological struggle.\n\n　　In connection with this struggle, we must strengthen the planning of the entire financial and economic work and strive for true unity and centralization. If the state of each doing its own thing in the financial and economic system is not overcome, then the phenomena of destruction and waste cannot be completely eliminated.\n\n　　At the same time, we must tighten up the protection methods and management system of state property. Political and economic organs must formulate systems for protecting and managing state property and public property, promulgate laws and regulations against destruction and waste of public property, and formulate strict sanction measures. Factories that cannot resume work for the time being and houses that cannot be repaired for the time being need to be guarded by special personnel. Do not save this relatively small expense and allow them to be destroyed, which would cause even greater losses to the state. Each factory, each agency, and each school must register all state property and public property, conduct regular inspections, and clearly define responsibilities and strictly enforce rewards and punishments for the custody and use of property.\n\n　　In connection with this struggle, we must also create a large-scale, mass movement to protect state property. Mobilize the masses, especially the working class, to fight against all destructive and wasteful phenomena. We must fully understand and bring into play the enthusiasm of the working class for production and construction.\n\n　　Finally, in the work of protecting state property, we must greatly enhance our vigilance, strengthen the work of safeguarding and eliminating spies, and prevent the sabotage plots of counter-revolutionary enemy agents.\n\n　　The editorial pointed out that the revolutionary people paid a huge price to take back the cities, industries, and railways they created from the counter-revolutionaries, and many comrades sacrificed their lives for this. Our existing property is not only the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the working people, but also the crystallization of the blood and sweat of revolutionary heroes. Therefore, protecting state property and public property is the sacred revolutionary responsibility of every worker, farmer, intellectual, Communist Party member, public servant, People's Liberation Army fighter, and all democratic人士 (democratic people).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北日报社论号召　保护国家财产\n\n1948-09-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北日报社论号召\n  　保护国家财产\n    【新华社东北一日电】东北日报顷发表题为“保护国家财产，保护公共财产”之社论称：\n    我们解放区现在有了大城市、大工业，也有了铁路，我们的国家财产与公共财产是大大增加了，这是中国革命发展过程中一个巨大的历史变化。因为有了这一变化，所以革命战争才能胜利地转入今天大规模进攻的形势。社论继称：一切国家财产和公共财产，都是中国劳动人民的血汗结晶，都是国家民族的巨大财富。这些财富如果拿在反革命手里，就成为压迫人民、榨取人民与支持反革命战争的工具；但是如果拿在革命人民手里，就会成为保卫人民利益、提高人民生活水平、支持革命战争的工具了。它们对于革命战争就是如此的成败攸关！\n    社论回溯十年内战和抗日战争时期的艰苦情况称：那时我们没有大城市、大工业和铁路，只靠中国共产党与中国人民不屈不挠的努力，组织农村中农业和手工业的经济力量，进行长期的艰苦的游击战争。那时，我们是尝过了“无工业，无城市”的滋味，受尽了千辛万苦的。那时我们都曾想到：如果我们一旦有了这些东西，一定要好好爱护它、使用它、依靠它来打倒反革命的统治。\n    社论指出，现在对于很好地保护国家财产与公共财产，可惜还有不少地方不少同志没有很好的注意和执行。特别在新收复区，有些搜检破铜烂铁的人们，把完整的车床、锅炉和发动机也“检”走了，使本来完整的工厂倒反而残缺不全；有的地方，在电气材料特别缺乏的时候，竟允许某些工厂收买电线熔铸痰盂、洗脸盆，还说这是“发展工业生产”；有的地方把路轨当废铁、把枕木当燃料，完全没有想到我们目前铁路建设工作是多么需用这些材料。在老地区，经过许多教育与斗争之后，上述现象是比较少多了，但仍有慢性的破坏与浪费现象。个别地方，工厂不慎失火了，价值巨大的粮食耗费了。这种对国家财产和公共财产的损坏和耗费，实是新民主主义经济建设中一个凶恶的敌人，对于这些现象的容忍放任，熟视无楮，无异对革命事业犯罪。\n    社论指出，造成这些现象的思想原因，主要的是长期在分散的，乡村的、游击战争的环境中所养成的游击习气、本位主义、狭隘的财政观点，以致在处理国家财产与公共财产的时候，没有整体观念，没有统一观念，没有计划观念，其结果，就不自觉地为了本单位的局部利益，破坏了整个的利益。再夹杂一些非无产阶级的思想——小生产者的散漫性，破坏性，自私心理与纨绔子弟不事生计的挥霍习气反映到革命队伍中来，就更加重了这类破坏现象与浪费现象。因此，保护国家财产与公共财产，是必须通过严重的思想斗争，才能达到目的。\n    联系这一斗争，要加强整个财经工作中的计划性，力求做到真正的统一与集中。如果财政经济系统中的各自为政的状态不克服，那末，破坏与浪费现象还是不能完全消灭的。\n    同时要严密国家财产的保护方法与管理制度。政权机关与经济机关必须订出保护与管理国家财产与公共财产的制度，颁布反对破坏与浪费公有财产的法令，订出严厉的制裁办法。一时不能复工的工厂和一时不能修复的房屋等等都需要专人看管，不要为节省此比较小的开支而任其破坏，反使国家受到更大的损失。每个工厂，每个机关，每个学校必须将一切国家财产及公共财产加以登记，定期检查，财产之保管与使用必须责职分明，赏罚严明。\n    联系这一斗争，还必须造成大规模的、群众性的、保护国家财产的运动。动员群众，首先是工人阶级去和一切破坏与浪费的现象作斗争。必须充分理解与发挥工人阶级对生产建设事业的积极性。\n    最后在保护国家财产的工作中必须大大提高我们的警惕性，加强保卫锄奸工作，防止反革命敌探特务的阴谋破坏。\n    社论指出，革命人民从反革命手里夺回自己所创造的城市、工业和铁路，曾经付出了巨大的代价，许多同志曾因此而贡献了自己的生命。我们现有的这些财产，不但是劳动人民血与汗的结晶，而且是革命英雄血与汗的结晶。因此保护国家财产和公共财产是每个工人、农民、知识分子、共产党员，公务人员和人民解放战士及一切民主人士的神圣的革命的责任。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Chinese and foreign parties continue to comment on the Kuomintang government's \"currency system reform,\" unanimously pointing out that its future is destined to fail. According to a TASS dispatch from Prague on the 25th, citing a Reuter's correspondent in Hong Kong: \"Hong Kong financial experts generally believe that the Chinese currency will not be stable, and will not be stable even in the short term before it experiences inflation like the old currency. Chinese manufacturers, businessmen, and speculators are exchanging old currency and even large amounts of foreign currency for new currency, but then hurriedly use the new currency to purchase goods. This situation will inevitably lead to an increase in the prices of bulk commodities, which is what the \"currency reform\" originally wanted to avoid. The ministers of the Chiang government have no confidence in the future and are transferring large amounts of funds to the United States and Hong Kong.\" In reports sent to Nanjing by the Kuomintang Central News Agency's correspondent in the United States, many American newspapers' views on Chiang Kai-shek's \"currency reform\" were also mentioned. Even the Wall Street's New York Journal of Commerce published an editorial on the 26th, pointing out: \"In fact, China's currency reform is destined to fail.\" \"There is still no indication that the government can correct the financial situation that first caused the rampant depreciation of the legal tender.\" A Washington Post editorial on the 27th stated: \"Currency reform is destined to fail while the civil war continues,\" and sarcastically said: \"The implementation of this 'currency reform' may be a plea to the 'gods' of the United States.\" An American \"government economist\" said: \"Currency reform can only succeed when military spending stops.\" Therefore, \"even if sufficient reserves are set aside to support the gold yuan, if the budget deficit and trade deficit continue to exist, it will inevitably be depleted.\" Brown, a columnist for the Washington Star, also believes: \"The gold yuan cannot solve the runaway inflation.\" The newspaper's editorial on the 26th further pointed out: \"The stability of Chinese currency cannot be achieved by government actions.\" The Los Angeles Times also published an editorial on August 22nd entitled \"China's New Currency Has Little Prospect,\" pointing out that \"the so-called gold yuan new currency order\" will not \"transform the economic situation from chaos to order.\" Arnold, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, believes: \"The reform is just scratching off a few zeros from the old currency numbers\" (Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 29th).\n\nAccording to various news reports, prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continue to rise. In Shanghai markets, although they are \"full of uniformed police and plainclothes (secret agents) monitoring prices\" (United Press), according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Shanghai on the 26th: \"All commodities have violated the government's decree to freeze prices at the level of August 19th, with prices increasing by 20 to 40 percent.\" On that day, at the Seymour Road market in Shanghai, \"no amount of money could buy pork. The pork merchants in the area were all arrested on the 24th for violating the price limit frozen at the August 19th level.\" (Associated Press) According to an Associated Press reporter's dispatch from Peiping on the 29th, \"Despite the police and threats, prices in the area are still far above the fixed prices of August 19th. Many commodities have considerable increases. For example, locally made butter has doubled in price, flour has more than doubled in price, and general commodities have generally increased by 25 percent.\" In Xi'an, a Central News Agency message on the 30th admitted: \"Some prices are struggling to rise, especially sporadic foods such as green vegetables and meat, with increases of up to 100%.\" The Kuomintang authorities have arrested merchants and vendors in the area for days, using violence to suppress prices, resulting in \"some stores holding back inventory, causing a shortage of goods in the market and creating a situation where there are goods but no market\" (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th). United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 25th believes that \"the government's order to freeze prices on August 19th has been met with resistance in food markets, hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, and retail stores in cities such as Shanghai, Xuzhou, Xi'an, Hankou, Chengdu, Tianjin, and Changsha.\" \"In many cities, black market transactions are growing again.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. According to a Moscow broadcast on August 25th, Masinu commented on the Kuomintang government's \"currency system reform\" and pointed out: In the Kuomintang-controlled areas of China, the currency system reform has been followed by another round of price increases. On the first day after the currency system reform in Shanghai, the prices of rice, oil, flour, and coal increased by 10 percent. In Guangzhou, prices generally increased by an average of 50 percent. In Chongqing, the prices of many items increased by 30 to 50 percent. Although the \"decree\" restricts prices to the level of August 19th, the soaring prices have not stopped. Masinu emphasized: \"This fact clearly proves that the Kuomintang's currency system reform measures not only cannot stop the economic crisis but also cannot stop its development.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中外许多专家和报纸一致指出　蒋匪“币改”注定失败\n\n1948-09-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中外许多专家和报纸一致指出\n  　蒋匪“币改”注定失败\n    【新华社陕北二日电】中外各方续评国民党政府的“币制改革”，一致指出其前途注定要失败。据塔斯社布拉格二十五日电引电通社香港访员报导：“香港财政专家咸信中国货币不会稳定，甚至在它如旧币一样发生通货膨胀以前的短期内都不会有稳定。中国制造家、商人与投机家，虽以旧币甚至大量外币来换取新币，但随即又匆忙以新币购买货物。这种情形将不可避免地造成大宗商品价格的上涨，而这种上涨却原是“币改”所想要避免的。蒋政府各部长都对前途没有信心，而将大量的资金输往美国与香港”。在国民党中央社驻美国记者连日发往南京的通报中，也提及许多美国报纸对蒋介石“币改”的看法。甚至华尔街的纽约商务日报亦于二十六日发表社论，指出：“事实上，中国货币改革是注定要失败的”。“现在尚无任何迹象可以证明政府能够矫正曾首先造成法币狂贬的财经情势”。华盛顿邮报二十七日社论称：“货币改革在内战继续进行时是注定要失败的”，并讽刺说：“这一‘币改’的实施，可能是向美国的‘神仙’求拜”。而一位美国“政府经济学家”则称：“币改显然只有在军费开支停止时才能成功”。因此，“即令把足够的准备金放在一边支持金圆，如果预算赤字与贸易入超继续存在，这也必定会消耗掉”。华盛顿明星报专栏作家布朗亦认为：“金圆券不可能解决狂奔不已的通货膨胀”。该报二十六日的社论又指出：“中国货币的稳定，非政府的行为所能达到。”美国洛杉矶时报亦于八月二十二日发表题为“中国新币前途不大”的社论，指出：“所谓金圆新币之命令”，不会使“经济局势由混乱而变成有秩序”。上海英国商会会长亚诺德认为：“改革只是将旧币数字划去几个零”（美联社二十九日上海电）。\n    另据各方消息报导，国民党统治区各地物价继续上涨。上海各市场，虽然“布满身着制服之警察与便衣（特务）监视物价”（合众社），但据法新社二十六日上海消息：“一切商品都违背了政府冻结物价在八月十九日水准的法令，涨价百分之二十至四十”。该日，上海西摩路市场，“无论出什么价钱，都买不到猪肉。该地的猪肉商二十四日曾因违反冻结于八月十九日水平的限价而全部被捕。”（美联社）另据美联社记者二十九日自北平报导“尽管有警察和威胁，该地区的物价仍然远远超过八月十九日的限定价格。许多商品都有可观的上涨。例如当地制造的牛油涨价一倍，面粉涨价一倍多，一般商品普遍涨价百分之二十五。”在西安，中央社三十日消息承认：“部分物价挣扎上升，尤以零星食品青菜肉类等为最多，上涨一倍。”国民党当局连日在该地逮捕商人、小贩，用暴力压抑物价的结果，“若干商店存货不售，致使市场货缺，造成有行无市的现象”（中央社二十九日电）。合众社上海二十五日电认为：“政府冻结八月十九日物价的命令，已在上海、徐州、西安、汉口、成都、天津、长沙等城市的食品市场、旅馆、饭店、澡堂和零售店中碰壁”。“许多城市中，黑市交易又在滋长”。\n    【新华社陕北二日电】据莫斯科八月二十五日广播，马西努评论国民党政府“币制改革”时指出：在中国国民党统治区内，随着币制改革而来的是再一次的物价高涨。在上海当币制改革后的第一天，米、油、面、煤的价格就增涨了百分之十。在广州，物价一般的平均涨了百分之五十。在重庆，有许多物品的价格增高了百分之三十至五十。虽然“法令”上限制物价于八月十九日的水平，可是物价的飞涨并未停止。马西努着重指出：“这种事实极明显的证明：国民党币制改革的措施，不仅不能停止经济危机，并且不能停止它的发展。”"

Although it was mentioned in the past that the capitalist management methods that should be criticized and accepted, they were actually rejected. All factories conducted in-depth self-criticisms at the meeting. The leaders of the Industrial Company blindly rushed ahead without investigation, and without calculating costs, they established two alkali plants, resulting in the expenditure of 10 to 20 million yuan without achieving much. There was a bureaucratic work style in the leadership, with more arrangements and less inspection, and the work was not thorough. Other factories also identified many serious errors in business management. Many factories only focused on quantity, failing to grasp the key points, aiming too high, and acting blindly. There was no plan in business management, and manpower and materials were seriously wasted. One factory often had surplus funds of 15 million yuan in the bank. Another factory often had 4 to 5 million yuan of unnecessary surplus funds. In one factory, formal production personnel accounted for only 58 percent of all employees, with the remaining 40 percent or more engaged in odd jobs. One factory produced an average of only two hours per day. One factory did not calculate costs for one year and three months, and the pricing of its products was inappropriate, resulting in a loss. These were inseparable from the bureaucratic work style in business management. Some factories had a tailism tendency in leadership, and dared not boldly manage and educate workers; some only emphasized the mass line, resulting in accommodation, and even wages were determined by the workers themselves. Some looked down on technical workers, feeling that technical workers were \"backward,\" and did not actively carry out education. In some factories, workers even replaced the factory director in managing the factory. The meeting also examined the phenomena of disorganization, lack of discipline, and non-implementation of resolutions in public factories: After the Jizhong March Industry and Commerce Conference, one factory did not implement the resolutions, and two managers quarreled, affecting production. Some factories resisted the leadership and did not implement instructions, resulting in a large number of bricks being burned but unable to be sold.\n\nAfter a thorough review, Luo Yushan, Director of the Jizhong Administrative Office, pointed out: \"There is still a phenomenon of inconsistency between the Jizhong public factories and the Industrial Company. The main reason is the existence of a bureaucratic housekeeping style, the emergence of the idea of independent producers, and the phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline. This is the biggest obstacle to the development of state-owned factories and should be resolutely overcome.\"\n\nAt the meeting, the draft economic discipline of North China and the draft business management, as well as the future direction and tasks, were discussed in detail. The general thinking on the current industrial production direction and tasks has begun to be clarified. The leather factory has planned to develop in the direction of tire specialization, and abolish white leather and nitric leather. The chemical factory decided to abolish the manufacture of batteries and bleaching powder, strengthen the manufacture of malodorous alkali, and study and experiment with alkali noodles. The idea of enterprise management has also been further clarified. Everyone is determined to correct the shortcomings of making false plans in the past, resolutely streamline unnecessary personnel, increase production, and improve quality. Overcome bureaucracy and serious waste, as well as shortcomings and errors such as disorganization and lack of discipline, strengthen management work, and complete production tasks.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中公营工厂会议　严格检查经营管理\n\n1948-09-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中公营工厂会议\n  　严格检查经营管理\n    【冀中电】冀中实业公司为贯彻华北工商会议的精神，于七月二十八日召开公营工厂厂长、经理会议。先后历时二十五天。会上根据华北工商会议的决议，严格批判了当前公营工厂管理工作中严重的盲目浪费、机关化、自满情绪和官僚主义作风。大家一致认为过去管理工厂是供给制的传统，有浓厚的手工业、作坊和机关家务的作风。虽然过去曾提到应批判的接受资本主义的管理方法，但实际上是拒绝接受。各个工厂在会议上都进行了深刻的检讨。实业公司领导上盲目蛮干，没调查、没计算成本就建立了两个碱厂，结果花费了一、二千万元，没有得到什么成绩。领导上存在着官僚主义作风，布置多而检查少，工作不深入。其他各厂也检查出经营管理上很多严重错误。不少工厂只图多，抓不住重点，好高鹜远，盲目乱干。在经营管理上没有计划，人力物力严重浪费。某工厂经常有多余资金一万五千万元存在银行。某工厂经常有四、五千万元不必要的余款。某工厂正式生产人员仅占全体职工的百分之五十八，其余百分之四十多都作了杂工。某工厂每天平均只生产两小时。某工厂在一年零三个月中，没计算成本，出品定价不当，结果赔了钱。这些都和经营管理上的官僚主义分不开。有的工厂在领导上存在着尾巴主义，不敢大胆管理教育工人，有的只强调走群众路线，结果形成迁就，甚至工资也叫工人自订。有的看不起技术工人，觉着技术工人“落后”，又不积极进行教育。有的工厂工人竟代替厂长管理了工厂。会议对公营工厂里的无组织无纪律和不执行决议等现象也作了检查：某工厂在冀中三月工商会议以后，不执行决议，两个经理闹分家，影响了生产。有的工厂和领导对抗，不执行指示，结果烧出大批砖卖不出去。\n    经过深刻检讨后，冀中行署罗玉山主任指出：“冀中公营工厂和实业公司，还有上下不一气的现象，主要原因是存在着机关家务的作风，产生了独立生产者的思想，和无组织无纪律现象。这是发展国营工厂的最大障碍，应该坚决克服。”\n    会上对华北经济纪律草案及经营管理草案，和今后方针、任务都作了详细的讨论。对于当前工业生产的方针任务，大的思想上已开始明确。皮革厂已计划向轮带专业化方向发展，取消白皮硝皮。化学厂决定取消制装电池、漂白粉，加强制造臭碱，并研究试验碱面。在企业化思想上，也进一步明确了。大家决心纠正过去订假计划等缺点，坚决精简不必要的人员，增加生产，提高质量。克服官僚主义及严重浪费与无组织无纪律等缺点与错误，加强管理工作，完成生产任务。"

    "content": "North Korea – A People's Country\n\n　　In August 1945, with the assistance of the powerful Soviet Red Army, the people of North Korea were liberated from nearly half a century of enslavement by Japanese imperialism. Today, the ten million people of North Korea, who account for 40 percent of the total Korean population, are building their paradise on this free land and have become a beacon inspiring the people of South Korea, enslaved by US imperialism, to fight.\n\n　　Before liberation, North Korea was the domain of Japanese monopoly capital and colonizers. It concentrated most of Korea's heavy industry, hydroelectric power, chemical industry, and coal and iron mining. The total value of industrial production accounted for about 50.2 percent of all of Korea, of which the total value of metal, power generation, and chemical industries accounted for more than 80 percent of all of Korea. The total value of agricultural production accounted for about 37.6 percent of the national production. The vast majority of farmers had no land, and tenant farmers accounted for 45 percent of the total number of tenant farmers in the country.\n\n　　After the Red Army entered, North Korea underwent a fundamental change: all factories, mines, railways, banks, etc. belonging to Japanese monopoly capital and Korean traitors were nationalized and handed over to the people's government for management. The land of Japanese colonizers and Korean traitors was confiscated and distributed without compensation to farmers who had no land or little land. 683,000 farming households received nearly one million hectares of cultivated land. Since liberation, the national economy has recovered and developed at a rapid pace. In the past two years, the output of industrial products has increased fourfold, and similar success has been achieved in improving agricultural production. The railway network and road networks have also fully returned to normal.\n\n　　Korea's first people's representative organ, the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, was officially established in Pyongyang in February 1946 through universal elections. In November of the same year, official elections were held for the People's Committees of provinces, cities, counties, and townships. All citizens who have reached the age of twenty, regardless of their gender, property, education, belief, or residence, have the right to vote and stand for election. 4.6 million voters participated in the voting, accounting for 99.6 percent of all voters, and elected representatives of all sectors of the people, including workers, farmers, staff, intellectuals, businessmen, industrialists, former landlords, and religious professionals, to participate in the people's representative organs at all levels. By February 1947, the formal People's Committee of North Korea was formed at the congress of representatives of the People's Committees in various regions. This is the highest organ of power that truly represents the interests of all sectors of North Korea except Korean traitors. Of the 21 members of the People's Committee, the Korean Workers' Party (the name after the merger of the Korean Communist Party and the Korean New Democratic Party), which represents the vast majority of workers and peasants, accounts for 11 members; the Korean Democratic Party, which represents general public educators, progressive intellectuals, national capitalists, and upper-class figures from all walks of life, accounts for 3 members; the Young Friends Party, which represents urban business circles and general middle-class figures, accounts for 2 members; and non-party members account for 5 members. Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean Workers' Party who insisted on the anti-Japanese struggle, was elected as chairman, and among the two vice-chairmen, one was Kim Chaek, another leader of the Workers' Party, and the other was Hong Ki-ju, the leader of the Democratic Party. In April of this year, amidst the joy of the people, the North Korean People's Assembly passed the Charter of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd – Reports from various sources: Among the Communist Party members and people of Yugoslavia, the forces supporting the Information Bureau's decision and opposing the Tito leadership group are growing daily. As early as late July, hundreds of Yugoslav students and overseas Chinese students in the Soviet Union issued declarations opposing the Tito group one after another, and wrote to the then-ongoing Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party requesting the replacement of the party's leaders to bring the party back to the track of Marxism-Leninism. Subsequently, some personnel from the Yugoslav Embassy in the United States, the mission to the United Nations, and the Embassy in Czechoslovakia, disregarding the pressure from their superiors belonging to the Tito group, successively issued joint protest declarations. At the end of July, the Yugoslav Ambassador to Romania, veteran Communist Party member Golobovich, attended the Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party and witnessed with grief all the measures of the Tito group that betrayed internationalism. After returning to Bucharest, he wrote to the Presidium of the National Assembly of Yugoslavia, protesting the Tito group's anti-Soviet policy and requesting his resignation. Mr. Golobovich simultaneously sent the original letter to Pravda in Moscow for publication and refused the Yugoslav government's order to return home. On August 24, the Yugoslav Minister to Iran, Ali Hodžić, and his staff also issued a statement opposing the Tito group. In addition, the well-known Yugoslav writer Becker, now in Prague, and Yugoslav Communist Party members in France also condemned the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in mid-August. As for Yugoslavia itself, on August 11, former Chief of the Army General Staff and wartime hero Lieutenant General Jovanović, along with two other senior military officers, left Yugoslavia for Romania due to their opposition to the Tito group. Unfortunately, they were shot by the Tito group's personnel before crossing the border. On August 14, the Deputy Commander of the Yugoslav Army Air Force, Communist Party member Major General Popivoda, flew an aircraft to Romania and wrote to Pravda in Moscow, exposing the truth about the Tito group's anti-Soviet and anti-people policies and the reign of terror in Yugoslavia. In his letter, Popivoda called out: \"Yugoslav Communists must bravely begin to work, so as to force the leading organs of our party to abandon their treacherous line, purge the party and government organs, bring them back to the big family of brotherly Communist Parties, and embark on the road of proletarian unity.\" According to a report by the Electrical News Agency, a Norwegian youth delegation that recently visited Yugoslavia said that even among the activists of the \"Tito Youth League,\" doubts and dissatisfaction with the political line pursued by the Tito group are increasingly expressed. According to the Associated Press and United Press, the Tito group is massively replacing dissidents in various party, government, and military departments, including many senior officials. To date, up to five thousand people have been arrested. However, this reign of terror, as the French Communist Party's L'Humanité stated on August 26, \"only proves the existence of forces opposing the current Yugoslav regime that are more powerful than previously imagined, and proves the correctness of the Information Bureau's confidence in the sound forces within the Yugoslav Communist Party\" (Electrical News Agency).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 南共党员与南国人民中　反铁托力量益增长\n\n1948-09-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　南共党员与南国人民中\n  　反铁托力量益增长\n    【新华社陕北二日电】各方报导：南斯拉夫的共产党员与人民中拥护情报局的决定和反对南共领导集团的力量正日益增长。早在七月下旬，数百名南斯拉夫留苏学生与侨民即先后发表宣言反对铁托集团，并致书当时正进行中的南共五届代表大会要求撤换党的领袖使党回复到马列主义的轨道上来。其后，南斯拉夫驻美大使馆、驻联合国使团以及驻捷克大使馆等的一部分人员，均不顾其属于铁托集团的首长之压力，先后联名发表抗议宣言。七月底，南驻罗马尼亚大使、南共老党员高鲁波维区，在列席南共第五届代表大会，痛心地目睹铁托集团一切叛变国际主义的措施，而回到布加勒斯特之后，即致书南人民议会主席团，抗议铁托集团的仇苏政策，并自请辞职。高氏同时将原信寄交莫斯科真理报发表，并拒绝了南政府召他回国的命令。八月二十四日，南驻伊朗公使阿里霍吉区及其属员亦发表声明，反对铁托集团。此外，现在布拉格的南著名作家贝克尔和旅法南共党员亦于八月中旬谴责南共中央。至于在南斯拉夫国内，八月十一日，前陆军参谋总长、战时抗敌英雄尤伐诺维区中将偕其他高级军官二人，因反对铁托集团，离开南国而往罗马尼亚，不幸在通过边境前为铁托集团人员枪杀。至八月十四日又有南陆军航空队副司令、南共党员波比沃达少将驾机飞至罗马尼亚，并致书莫斯科真理报，揭露铁托集团反苏反人民政策的真相与南斯拉夫国内的恐怖统治。波氏在信中号召：“南共党员必须勇敢地着手工作，俾迫使我们党的领导机构放弃其叛变路线，清洗党和政府机构，使之回到兄弟共产党的大家庭中，并走上无产阶级团结的大道。”据电通社报导最近访南归来的挪威青年代表团谈，即使在“铁托青年联盟”的积极分子中也已对铁托集团所奉行的政治路线日益表示怀疑和不满。据美联社与合众社消息：铁托集团正大批撤换党政军各部门中的反对分子，包括许多高级人员在内，迄今被逮捕者已达五千人。但这种恐怖统治，正如八月二十六日法共人道报所称，“只是证明了较以前所想象者更为强大的反对南斯拉夫现政权的力量之存在，并证明情报局决定中对南共党内健全力量的信心之正确”（电通社）。"

    "content": "Taihang Administrative Office, Military Region Joint Order\n　Unite the Majority to Organize Autumn Protection\n　Promptly Prepare for Autumn Harvest, Autumn Planting, and Wheat Sowing\n[Taihang Telegraph] In order to welcome the autumn protection struggle in northern Henan, the Taihang Administrative Office and Military Region issued a joint order on August 22. The basic task of this year's autumn protection struggle is to further mobilize and organize the masses in the border and guerrilla areas on the basis of the victory of the summer harvest struggle, and to carry out a full-scale autumn protection struggle. To achieve this task, it is necessary to continue to implement correction of deviations, correct policies, unite the masses, consolidate and expand the united front against the Chiang Kai-shek bandit border areas, and isolate the enemy. Regarding the specific implementation of tasks, in addition to the army doing a good job in preparation, each special and county should also hold special meetings to discuss the plan, steps and methods of autumn harvest and grain storage. In the general, in-depth and specific mobilization, in addition to pointing out the reasons for the victory of the summer harvest struggle, it is necessary to recognize that the task of the autumn harvest struggle will be longer and more arduous than the summer harvest, so it is necessary to be vigilant and overcome complacency, luck, and paralysis. In addition, it is necessary to recognize that the autumn harvest struggle is a general and widespread struggle, but it must be organized with emphasis and closely combined with the strength of all parties. Under unified leadership, with the autumn protection struggle as the central task, launch an offensive against the enemy and a struggle to protect grain and manpower. Under the general principle of winning the autumn protection struggle, establish county and district headquarters with the county as the unit, with the county and district cadres as the backbone, combined with militia, armed work teams, and other armed organizations, and go deep into the enemy area and near strongholds to disrupt the enemy's transportation, strike the enemy's transportation, crush the enemy's grain robbery, destroy the enemy's bunkers, and annihilate the enemy. In addition, the county and district headquarters should strengthen intelligence and mobilize the masses to disintegrate the enemy. In particular, we must give play to the experience of the masses in the past struggle against grain requisition and prevent the view of simply relying on arms. In the autumn protection struggle, the leadership should constantly supervise, inspect and sum up experience, and promptly commend and criticize. Prevent self-flow and the phenomenon of being tight at the beginning and loose at the end.\n　[Taihang Telegraph] The Beginning of Autumn has passed, and the season for autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and wheat planting is approaching. In order to do a good job in preparation and carry out the autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and wheat planting movement, the Taihang Administrative Office has issued the following instructions: (1) Publicize that when land certificates are issued this winter, only minor adjustments of land will be combined with the correction of deviations, and there will be no large-scale withdrawal and replenishment, filling in and making up. Those who have not made adjustments before autumn cultivation and wheat planting, such as minor land changes, will have whoever plants the wheat, who harvests it, and those who only cultivate but do not plant will also give the original owner compensation for wages and fertilizers. At the same time, it is necessary to carry out production education, eliminate ideological obstacles, and restore and develop the large-scale production movement. (2) In addition to continuing to implement fertilizer accumulation, labor exchange organizations for people and animals should be organized to carry out autumn harvest, autumn cultivation, and wheat planting in a planned manner. Mutual aid organizations should truly be voluntary combinations, in various organizational forms that are welcomed and loved by the masses. (3) Wheat seed adjustments must be organized, and the selection of autumn crops should be promoted. Break the conservative, backward and unscientific psychology of the masses. And organize the masses to purchase red alum asphalt and other insecticides, and promote seed disinfection as a necessary step to restore and improve agricultural technology.

For seventy days, you fought the enemy with unparalleled heroism, writing the most glorious page in the history of the people's liberation struggle with your own blood, creating the immortal epic of Grammos. The royalist fascists originally planned to annihilate the majority of the Democratic Army in Grammos and then defeat the Democratic Army in other areas of Greece. This is why the enemy concentrated more than 100,000 troops and various powerful American weapons in Smólikas and Grammos. But your resistance shattered the enemy's plan. This is the greatest victory of the Democratic Army. Our troops bravely and fiercely resisted the enemy, inflicting nearly 25,000 casualties on enemy officers and soldiers, and then carried out an organized transfer, moving all troops and equipment to other areas to continue the fight. All commanders and fighters of the Grammos Democratic Army: The battle that began in Smólikas and Grammos continues—this is a battle for Greece, for freedom, for the independence of our motherland. Inspired by the heroic example of the defenders of Grammos Mountain, the Democratic Armies in Thessaly, Roumeli, Morea, Epirus, Macedonia, and Thrace are turning the whole of Greece into a great Grammos. In Athens and other Greek cities, workers and civil servants are fighting for bread and the right to survive. Grammos has become a symbol of freedom and democracy, calling on us to continue the fight until we win. We have given the enemy a severe lesson, we have made him tired and exhausted.

In North Korea, the elections were conducted through universal, direct, equal, and secret ballots. On that day, early in the morning, many voters in the 212 electoral districts of North Korea gathered in queues to prepare for voting even before the polling stations opened. Within three to five hours after the start of voting, almost all voters had completed their ballots.

Mass celebrations were held in towns and villages, continuing joyously until late at night.\n    In South Korea, the election of the All-Korean Supreme People's Assembly could not be held through direct voting due to the frenzied suppression by the US occupying authorities and the South Korean reactionaries.

As previously reported, the representatives of the South Korean People's Congress elected by the South Korean people held a conference in Haeju City, North Korea, on August 21st.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-05",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd: Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, and Song Shaowen, Director of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Administrative Committee, reported to the North China Provisional People's Congress on August 9th on the work of the two border region governments. They detailed the great achievements made by the two regions in mobilizing the masses, supporting the war, implementing land reform, and developing production since the Japanese surrender.\n\nConcerning Support for the War:\n\nIn the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged men have joined the army in the past two years, 99% of whom are peasants who have been emancipated after land reform and have a very high level of political awareness. Seven hundred thousand militiamen throughout the region cooperated with the main forces in combat. In the past year alone, they killed, wounded, and captured 38,395 enemy officers from brigade commander and regimental commander down. There has also been great progress in the economical use of civilian labor in war services, gradually reducing from five laborers per soldier at the beginning to one laborer per soldier. Now it is done with two or three soldiers per laborer. Most of the military families throughout the army have been properly taken care of in the equal distribution of land and burdens. In the past two years, more than 80,000 veterans have been given pensions and resettled.\n\nIn the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region, hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged men have also joined the army in the past two years and 500,000 militiamen have participated in front-line combat, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 20,000 enemy soldiers. The broad masses of people in the rear actively undertook war services and cultivated land on behalf of some military families. In addition to resettling more than 35,000 veterans, the government also organized veterans' management offices, established veterans' schools for education, and provided job referrals.\n\nConcerning Land Reform:\n\nIn 1946, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region carried out a universal land reform and leveling-up movement. By March 1947, the old and semi-old areas with a population of 21.5 million, excluding the border guerrilla areas, had eliminated the feudal system. About 90% of the poor and hired peasants were allocated land and some floating property and means of production roughly equivalent to the average (the average obtained by dividing the total cultivated land area by the region's population). Only 10% of the poor and hired peasants, although they also received some land and property, had not yet obtained due satisfaction. Middle peasants generally maintained land above the average, and their production capital and tools were relatively abundant. Landlords and rich peasants generally had land equal to or slightly less than the average. After the autumn of last year, the entire region shifted to focusing on production while quickly resolving the small number of supplementary adjustments and correcting deviations. Due to the past lack of clear and specific instructions from the leadership on certain issues, the failure to deepen policy education, and the lack of timely inspection and understanding, left-leaning errors of varying degrees occurred in the later stages of land reform in various places, such as infringing on middle peasants and infringing on industry and commerce. After the review at the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China cadre meeting in November last year, resolute measures were taken to correct the deviations, strengthen ideological education to correct the policies among cadres and the masses, and promulgate various relatively specific and detailed deviation correction methods in accordance with the \"Outline Land Law of China\" and various policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. After several months of efforts, the deviations have been largely corrected and have entered a normal construction state.\n\nIn the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region, after the Japanese surrender, the broad masses of people carried out an anti-traitor liquidation movement and voluntarily demanded land. In the year after May 1946, more than half of the farmers in the region participated in the movement to equally distribute land. After the review in May 1947, the land problem had been largely resolved in parts of Central Hebei, Jinbei and Chahar. In the autumn of last year, the Administrative Committee of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region also passed a resolution to use the \"Outline Land Law of China\" as the land law of the border region. After the supplementary distribution from last winter to this spring, more than 90% of the areas with a population of 10,680,000 have largely achieved equal distribution of land, and only about 8% of the areas still need to continue supplementary distribution. The following deviations also occurred in the land reform: the leadership was impatient, and the merits and demerits of village cadres, the severity of the responsibility for making mistakes were not strictly distinguished in the land reform, and the education and persuasion of the masses were also insufficient. In the early stage of the movement, many middle peasants were wrongly designated as rich peasants and landlords, and after successive corrections, about 80% have been thoroughly or relatively well corrected so far, and the remaining 20% still need to be seriously corrected. At the same time, some industry and commerce were infringed, of which 92% have been thoroughly corrected, and the rest still need to be corrected.\n\nConcerning Economic Construction:\n\nAfter detailing the achievements of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region in increasing grain production, improving agricultural technology, planting trees, water conservancy, developing rural sideline industries, machine industries, transportation, finance, and trade in the past two years, Chairman Yang Xiufeng emphasized that due to grasping the correct implementation of the policy of developing agriculture, industry, and commerce during the intense war, prices have remained balanced in the past two years, and in foreign trade, there has been a surplus of 16.59 billion yuan in the past two years. Mistakes have also been made in production and construction, mainly formalism and coercion in agricultural production, such as the occurrence of organizing mutual aid and labor exchange without following the principles of voluntariness and equivalent value. In industrial production, the leadership lacked planning and experience, was not good at management, and had relief and egalitarian views on wage issues. All of these have been corrected or are being corrected.\n\nIn the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei border region, Director Song Shaowen pointed out that the most successful aspect of agricultural production is water conservancy construction, and there has also been significant progress in breeding livestock, eliminating wasteland, and restoring and developing rural sideline industries. In the industrial sector, the machine industry has grown from small to large and is gradually developing towards modernization, but in general, there are still shortcomings such as high costs, poor quality, low technical level, high labor costs, large waste, and remnants of the supply system in the wage system, which must be greatly improved.\n\nConcerning Culture and Education:\n\nChairman Yang said: In 1946 and the first half of 1947 in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, school education developed vigorously, and the North China United University and many middle schools and normal schools were established, training more than 5,000 cadres in various fields. In the second half of 1947, under the left-leaning influence of land reform and party rectification work, \"three investigations\" were carried out in schools, resulting in a serious phenomenon of reduced schools and students, and a decline in the cultural level of students. After the corrections since this year, according to recent reports from various places, the errors have been gradually corrected. Currently, there are 30 middle schools and normal schools with more than 7,000 students; 960 complete primary schools with more than 144,000 students; and 38,579 elementary schools with more than 2,234,400 students. In terms of social education, current affairs politics and some production education have been strengthened; literacy, hygiene, and breaking superstitions still need to be improved.\n\nFrom 1946 to the spring of this year, the North China United University, Medical University, Industrial and Transportation College, and various middle schools in Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei have trained a total of more than 10,000 cadres. Currently, in addition to military schools and universities, there are 67 middle schools and normal schools with more than 11,000 students, 677 higher primary schools with more than 47,000 students; and 17,458 elementary schools with more than 1,089,400 students. Social education has also developed unprecedentedly, with civil schools, rooftop broadcasts, blackboards, and reading groups spreading throughout the vast countryside. Larger cities have civil education centers responsible for promoting urban social education. The problems that need to be solved in the cultural and educational fields at present include improving educational institutions, unifying and stipulating the guiding principles for running schools, as well as comprehensive plans for the school system, curriculum, etc., training teachers, and appropriately improving their treatment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 杨秀峰主席、宋劭文主任在华北临时人代会上　分别报告政府工作　支前土改生产两区均获巨大成绩\n\n1948-09-05\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　杨秀峰主席、宋劭文主任在华北临时人代会上\n  　分别报告政府工作\n  　支前土改生产两区均获巨大成绩\n    【新华社华北二日电】晋冀鲁豫边区政府主席杨秀峰、晋察冀边区行政委员会主任委员宋劭文八月九日分别向华北临时人民代表大会报告两边区政府工作，详述两区自日本投降以来发动群众、支援战争、实行土改、发展生产所获得的巨大成绩。\n    关于支援战争\n    晋冀鲁豫全区两年来有数十万青壮年参军，其中百分之九十九系土改后翻身之农民，政治觉悟极高。全区七十万民兵配合主力作战，仅去年一年，毙伤俘敌旅长团长以下达三万八千三百九十五人。在战争勤务的节约使用民力上亦有极大进步，由开始时之一兵五夫逐渐减至一兵一夫，现在则做到二兵一夫或三兵一夫。全军军属，在平分土地和负担上多半得到适当照顾。两年来抚恤和安置荣誉军人八万余人。\n    在晋察冀边区两年多来参军之青壮年亦有数十万人，民兵参加前线作战者达五十万，毙伤俘敌二万余。后方广大人民则积极负担战勤，并为部分军属代耕土地。除安置了三万五千余荣誉军人外，政府并组织了荣誉军人管理处，设立荣誉军人学校进行教育，并介绍工作。\n    关于土地改革\n    晋冀鲁豫一九四六年进行了普遍的土地改革及填平补齐运动，至一九四七年三月，除边沿区游击区外，全区拥有人口二千一百五十万的老区半老区已消灭了封建制度，贫雇农中百分之九十左右分得了大体相当于平均数（全区人口除耕地总面积所得的平均数）的土地及部分浮财和生产工具，只有百分之十的贫雇农虽亦分得了部分土地和财产，但尚未获得应有的满足。中农一般保持平均数以上的土地，生产资本及工具则比较优裕。地主富农土地一般等于或略少于平均数。去年秋后，全区即转入以生产为中心，同时迅速解决小部分的抽补调剂及纠正偏向问题。由于领导上过去对某些问题指示不够明确具体，政策教育未能深入，检查了解不够及时，土改后期各地曾发生程度不同的侵犯中农、侵犯工商业等左倾错误。经过去年十一月中共晋冀鲁豫中央局干部会议的检讨，坚决地采取了严肃的纠偏措施，在干部与群众中，加强端正政策的思想教育，并按照中国土地法大纲及中共中央各种政策，颁行各种比较具体详细的纠偏办法，经数月努力，偏向已大体纠正，进入正常建设状态。\n    在晋察冀边区，日本投降后广大人民曾进行了反奸清算运动，并自动起来要求土地。从一九四六年五月以后的一年中，全区有半数以上农民参加了平分土地的运动。又经过一九四七年五月的复查，冀中、冀晋及察哈尔的部分地区，大体上已解决了土地问题。去年秋季，晋察冀边区行政委员会又通过决议，以中国土地法大纲为边区土地法。经过去冬今春的抽补，在一千零六十八万人口的地区，已有百分之九十以上地区大体实现了平分土地，只有约百分之八的地区尚须继续抽补。在土地改革中亦曾发生下列偏向：即领导上的性急，在土地改革中对村干部的功过大小、犯错误责任的轻重未严格区分，而对群众的教育说服亦不够。在运动初期曾把许多中农错订为富农、地主，后经陆续改正，至目前止改正得彻底和改正得较好的占百分之八十左右，还有百分之二十尚待继续认真纠正。同时也侵犯了某些工商业，其中百分之九十二已彻底纠正，其余仍待纠正。\n    关于经济建设\n    杨秀峰主席于详述晋冀鲁豫边区两年来增产粮食、提高农业技术、植树、水利、发展农村副业、机器工业、交通运输、金融贸易等各方面之成绩后，着重指出由于在紧张战争中抓紧正确执行发展农工商业之政策，二年来物价均保持平衡，在对外贸易上两年来出超一百六十五亿九千余万元。在生产建设上也曾犯过错误，主要是农业生产上的形式主义与强迫命令现象，如发生不按自愿、等价的原则组织互助变工。在工业生产中则是领导上缺乏计划与经验，不善经营，工资问题上有救济及平均主义的观点等。凡此均早已改正或正在改正。\n    在晋察冀边区，宋劭文主任指出在农业生产中最有成绩的是水利建设，在繁殖牲畜，消灭熟荒，恢复与发展农村副业等方面亦有显著进步。在工业方面，机器工业由小而大，逐渐向近代化发展，但一般尚存在成本高、质量差、技术水平低、用人多、浪费大以及工资制度上的供给制残余等缺点，须大力改进。\n    关于文化教育\n    杨主席称：在晋冀鲁豫区一九四六年及一九四七年上半年，学校教育蓬勃发展，创办了北方大学及许多中学、师范，培养了五千多各方面的干部。一九四七年下半年，在土地改革和整党工作中的左倾影响之下，在学校里进行“三查”，以致发生学校与学生减少，学生文化程度降低的严重现象。经过今年以来的纠正，据最近各地报告，错误已逐渐改正，现全区共有中学、师范三十座，学生七千余人；完全小学九百六十座，学生十四万四千余人；初小三万八千五百七十九座，学生二百二十三万四千余人。在社会教育方面，时事政治及某些生产教育加强了；识字、卫生及破除迷信等教育则有待改进。\n    晋察冀文化教育工作，自一九四六年至今年春季，华北联合大学、医科大学、工业交通学院以及各中学，总共培养出一万以上的干部。现全区除军事学校及大学外，有中学、师范六十七处，学生一万一千余人，高小六百七十七处，学生四万七千余人；初小一万七千四百五十八处，学生一百零八万九千余人。社会教育亦有空前发展，民校以及屋顶广播、黑板报、读报组等遍及广大农村，较大城市均设有民教馆，负责推动城市社会教育。目前文教方面尚待解决的问题则有健全教育机构，统一规定办理学校的方针以及学制、课程等的通盘计划，培养师资，适当提高其待遇等。"

Three hundred and three businesses have already opened their doors. The government also provided loans of 5 million yuan to support them. The state-owned trading company, in order to regulate the market and supply the daily necessities of the citizens, has sold 400 shi of wheat, 5,600 jin of sea salt, and 1,000 jin of sesame oil to the market. Prices immediately fell. Sea salt fell from 900 yuan per jin to 750 yuan, and sesame oil fell from 6,400 yuan per jin to 3,200 yuan.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Reports from various sources indicate that the French Marie cabinet, established just a month ago, collapsed on the 28th. Marie resigned after insurmountable disagreements arose during a cabinet meeting to draft and implement the Reynaud financial and economic program. According to Agence France-Presse, \"the point of contention in the cabinet meeting was the issue of wage increases; Finance Minister Reynaud was prepared to agree to a 10 percent increase, while the Socialists insisted on a 15 to 16 percent increase.\" However, as Agence France-Presse stated, \"it must be emphasized that there was no fundamental difference in the views of Reynaud and Blum (leader of the Socialist Party).\" In fact, the Socialist Party was an enthusiastic accomplice of Marie while the Marie cabinet was vigorously pursuing its \"Reynaud Plan\" and raising prices. Only when these reactionary policies had aroused widespread dissatisfaction and anger among the French people did they \"force the 'Workers' Force' faction of the trade union, initiated by the Socialist Party, to align with the General Confederation of Labor on the wage issue\" (Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th). At the same time, with municipal elections about to be held, the Socialist Party, wearing the mask of \"defender of the people,\" had to make some \"politically necessary gestures before the election\" (ibid.). Therefore, the French Communist Party's organ, \"L'Humanité,\" pointed out: \"The downfall of Blum, Reynaud, Marie, and Schuman is the result of popular discontent. Their high-price policies, their demands for anti-democratic privileges, and their policies of preparing for war have aroused the anger of the entire French people\" (TASS, Paris, 28th). The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué stating: \"The current cabinet crisis proves that a government without the participation of workers and against the working class is incapable of managing state affairs.\" The communiqué firmly advocated \"organizing a broad democratic coalition government that will implement a genuine patriotic policy, protect industry, prevent worker unemployment, and reduce the cost of living by reducing the scandalous profits of capitalists, while adjusting wages and stipulating a minimum essential wage of 12,900 francs per month\" (Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th). The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a communiqué on the night of the 28th, calling on all workers to strengthen unity and action in order to establish \"a democratic coalition government\" in France (ibid.).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 没工人参加的政府是无能的　法国马利内阁短命成立刚一月就倒台\n\n1948-09-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　没工人参加的政府是无能的\n  　法国马利内阁短命成立刚一月就倒台\n    【新华社陕北二日电】各方报导：成立刚刚才一个月的法国马利内阁，已在二十八日倒台。马利是在内阁草拟实施雷诺财政与经济纲领的会议上发生了没有办法克服的分歧以后提出辞职的。据法新社报导，内阁会议的“争执之点是增加薪资问题，财长雷诺准备同意增加百分之十，而社会党则坚持要增加百分之十五到十六”。但是，如法新社所说，“必须强调指出，雷诺和勃鲁姆（社会党头子）的观点，并没有基本上的不同”。事实上，在马利内阁大搞其“雷诺计划”和抬高物价政策时，社会党正是马利的一名热心的帮凶。只是在这些反动政策已引起法国人民的普遍不满和愤怒的时候，才“迫使社会党所发起的‘工人力量’派工会，在工资问题上同总工会一致”（电通社巴黎二十九日电）。同时在这市选行将举行的时候，带上“人民保卫者”假面具的社会党也不得不作些“在选举前的政治上所必要的表示”（同上）。所以法共机关报“人道报”指出：“勃鲁姆、雷诺、马利和舒曼倒台是人民不满的结果。他们的物价高涨政策，他们要求反民主特权和准备战争的政策，已引起全法国人民的愤怒”（塔斯社巴黎二十八日电）。法国总工会执行局发表公报说：“目前的内阁危机证明了，没有工人参加并且反对工人阶级的政府，是不可能管理国事的。”公报坚决主张“组织一个广泛的民主联合政府，这一政府将执行一种真正的爱国政策，保护工业，不使工人失业，同时以减少资本家的可耻的利润来降低生活费，并调整工资，规定必不可少的工资为每月一万二千九百法郎。”（法新社巴黎二十八日电）法共政治局二十八日夜发表公报，号召一切工人加强团结与行动，以便使法国成立“一个民主的联合政府”（同上）。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS reports: _Pravda_, on the eve of the third anniversary of the US military's entry into Japan (September 2, 1945), published an article criticizing the policies of the Japanese Zaibatsu and the Ashida government, stating that they are leading Japan towards disaster and turning Japan into a US colony. _Pravda_ stated: There are already 187 foreign companies operating in Japan. Representatives of American monopoly enterprises are everywhere in Japan. Japanese industry mainly uses expensive raw materials imported from the United States. The living standards of the working people in Japanese cities and villages are below the bare minimum. In March alone, farmers paid 10 billion yen in taxes, leaving no funds to purchase fertilizers and the most basic farm implements. The so-called land \"reform\" formulated by the Allied Headquarters and the reactionary Japanese government is designed to accommodate the interests of the landlords and cannot eliminate the semi-feudal and semi-servile state in Japanese rural areas. _Pravda_ pointed out: The rampant activity of the Japanese reactionaries demonstrates the close alliance between militarism and Japanese-American merchants. This reactionary alliance aims not only to oppose the vital interests of the broad strata of the Japanese people but also to oppose the foundations of world peace and security.\n\nAccording to a Domei News Agency dispatch from Tokyo: Negotiations between American and Japanese industrial companies have been going on for quite some time. The United States is trying to seize a large part of Japanese industry. Previous negotiations mainly concerned the restoration of the $86 million in pre-war American industrial investment in Japan; now, the discussion is about further \"opening up\" Japanese industry to investment by American companies. According to the _Asahi Shimbun_: A considerable number of American companies, especially in the electrical and shipbuilding industries, are proposing to provide technical assistance to Japanese companies in exchange for ownership of stock. American International General Electric has already made such a proposal to Tokyo Shibaura Electric (Japan's largest electrical equipment manufacturer); General Electric already holds 28 percent of Shibaura's stock. American Reynolds Metals Company is demanding 51 percent of the stock and half of the board positions of Japan Light Metal Company as compensation for its investment.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 真理报评日本局势：  日财阀及芦田政府正使日本走向灾难\n\n1948-09-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　真理报评日本局势：\n    日财阀及芦田政府正使日本走向灾难\n    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社讯：真理报在美军进驻日本（一九四五年九月二日）三周年前夕，著文抨击日本财阀及芦田政府的政策正在使日本走向灾难，并使日本变为美国殖民地。真理报称：在日本开办的外国公司已有一百八十七家。日本到处都有美国独占企业的代表。日本工业主要使用自美国输入的高价原料。日本城乡劳动人民的生活水准低到最低限度以下。仅在三月份，农民纳税百亿日元，没有余款购买肥料和最简陋的农具。盟军总部及反动日本政府所拟定的所谓土地“改革”，是为了适应地主利益的，并不能消灭日本农村中的半封建半奴役状态。真理报指出：日本反动派的猖獗，说明了军国主义与美日商人之间的密切结盟的关系。这一反动的联盟，目的不仅在于反对日本人民广大阶层的切身利益，而且也反对世界和平与安全的基础。\n    另据电通社东京消息：美日产业公司之间的谈判已进行颇久，美国力图夺取日本工业的大部分。以前谈判内容多为恢复战前美国对日工业投资八千六百万美元的问题；现在所谈的是把日本工业进一步“开放”给美国公司投资的问题。据朝日新闻载：相当数量的美国公司，特别是电气业及造船业正提议供给日本公司技术援助，以换取股票的所有权。美国国际通用电气公司已向东京芝浦电气公司（日本最大的电气设备制造公司）提出这种建议；本来通用公司早已握有芝浦公司百分之二十八的股票。美国雷诺金属公司则要求取得日本轻金属公司百分之五十一的股票与一半的董事职位，作为投资的报酬。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: According to the Fuzhou correspondence in the \"Outlook\" magazine, Volume 2, Issue 11, of Nanjing on August 17, US imperialism has been actively invading Fujian in the past half year. From October last year to April this year, Corden, an American engineer from the Kuomintang government's \"Central Hydropower Generation Office,\" went to Gutian, northwest of Fuzhou, to investigate water conservancy. Durant, a representative of the American banking group, went to southern Fujian to investigate \"construction projects.\" Zhou Zixing, the Chinese manager of the American \"Jiangnan Construction Company,\" and the American engineer, Dunard, and others inspected the Gutian Creek hydropower project, the paper industry, the coal mines in Linsen and Shaowu counties in northern Fujian, the minerals in southwestern Fujian, and the Mawei port. Dai Jiege, an inspector of the American \"China Relief Mission,\" went to Fuzhou, Zhangpu, Xiamen, and other places to inspect. The \"Geological Survey Team\" went to Jinjiang and the Jiulong River to survey the soil and geological conditions of the two river basins. Drillers from the American \"Goodyear Company\" went to Fujian to explore for lead mines. Even the American destroyer \"Twolte\" visited Fujian.\n\nAfter this series of \"inspections,\" the US plot to invade Fujian has been gradually implemented. The Jiangnan Construction Company has already invested in establishing the Gutian Creek power generation project, with the plant site located in Xunting. Once this project is completed, the economies of the surrounding thirteen counties, including Fuzhou, Linsen, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Pingnan, Jian'ou, Nanping, Youxi, Minqing, Changle, and Yongtai, will be controlled by it. It can also indirectly control the mining of Gutian ironsand and sulfide mines in Yongtai, Ningde, and other counties. It can also use electricity refrigeration to control the fisheries of Fujian Province.\n\nIn terms of the paper industry, Kuomintang bureaucratic capital has colluded with the Jiangnan Construction Company to select Mawei as the site for a paper mill, covering an area of 2,000 mu. All the farmers living in the area of the factory site and the rice seedlings they planted were forcibly cleared in early May, and construction began in July. Personnel have also been sent to Longyan and Yongchun in southern Fujian to prepare for the construction of paper mills. Fujian is one of the three major forest areas in the country, and the local handmade paper industry has always been developed. In the future, the original paper industry in the province will be squeezed by American capital and fall into despair.\n\nIn terms of minerals, the Jiangnan Construction Company is also preparing to invest in mining. The mining plans for coal mines in Longyan, Jian'ou, Chong'an, Liancheng, Yongtai, and other counties, as well as iron mines in Anxi, Shanghang, Hua'an, and other places, have been submitted to Washington for review. In addition, the company plans to build a railway from Xiamen to Longyan to facilitate its invasion.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝积极侵略福建　对矿产森林水电工程等已作半年调查连串投资及控制计划正逐步付诸实施\n\n1948-09-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝积极侵略福建\n  　对矿产森林水电工程等已作半年调查连串投资及控制计划正逐步付诸实施\n    【新华社华东一日电】据八月十七日南京“展望”杂志二卷十一期福州通讯披露：近半年来，美帝国主义积极侵略福建。去年十月至今年四月间，曾先后有国民党政府“中央水力发电处”美籍工程师柯登赴福州西北之古田考察水利，美国银行团代表杜朗至闽南调查“建设事业”，美商“江南建设公司”华籍经理周自兴及美籍工程师杜纳德等考察古田溪水电工程、制纸工业、闽北林森、邵武等县煤矿、闽西南矿产、及马尾港口等，美“援华救济团”视察戴杰恪赴福州、漳浦、厦门等地考察，“地质调查队”赴晋江及九龙江勘察两江流域土壤及地质情形，美国“固特异公司”钻探家至闽钻探铅矿，甚至美国驱逐舰“特窝尔特”号亦来闽访问。美国侵略福建的阴谋计划在这一连串的“视察”后，已逐步付诸实行。江南建设公司已投资建立古田溪发电工程，厂址设在循亭，这一工程完成后，其周围福州、林森、连江、罗源、宁德、屏南、建瓯、南平、尤溪、闽清、长乐、永泰等十三县经济都要受其控制，并可间接控制古用铁砂矿及永泰、宁德等县硫化矿的开采，另可利用电力冷藏控制闽省渔业。造纸业方面，国民党官僚资本已与江南建设公司相勾结，择定马尾设立造纸厂，占地两千亩，所有居住在厂址一带农民及其所种植的秧苗，五月上旬即被武力清除，七月间开始动工兴筑。并已派员至闽南龙岩、永春两地筹建造纸厂。福建为全国三大森林地带之一，当地手工造纸业一向发达，今后该省原有纸业势将遭受美国资本排剂而陷于绝境。矿产方面，江南建设公司亦准备投资开采，关于龙岩、建瓯、崇安、连城、永泰等县煤矿及安溪、上杭、华安等地铁矿的开采计划书，已送交华盛顿审核。此外，该公司并拟兴建厦门到龙岩的铁路，以便利其侵略。"

TASS, Moscow, 26th: *Labor Daily* published an article entitled \"The Crisis of the Two-Party System and the American Progressive Party,\" which stated: The rise of the new American Progressive Party is a direct result of the crisis of the monopoly two-party system and the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with the anti-popular domestic and foreign policies of the rulers. The Progressive Party represents the anti-imperialist and anti-fascist sentiments that permeate the United States, and it appears in the form of a broad united front. It has the support of a large number of workers, the vast majority of farmers, progressive liberal professionals, the urban middle class, and the oppressed black people. All these social strata are united in the common desire to safeguard democratic rights and freedoms. This has been proven by the Progressive Party movement and the party's national congress. The article continued: The American Communist Party, as the independent party activity of the American proletariat, announced its support for the Progressive Party's policy of striving for peace, opposing inflation and fascism. However, the American Communist Party also pointed out that there are differences with Wallace on certain basic and tactical issues. According to recent newspaper reports, the American Communist Party is consolidating and expanding its ranks, strengthening the united front of the working masses, and working towards the unity of action of the American working people to promote democracy, peace and freedom. The article concluded: The united front of American progressive forces against monopoly capital, whose strength and scale are growing day by day, is an indisputable fact.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Reports from various sources: Baldwin, director of the Progressive Party's campaign movement, recently declared that the new party will be able to participate in the November election in forty-four to forty-six of the forty-eight states in the United States. Only in Florida and Oklahoma has the Progressive Party been definitively rejected from participating in the election. Because the rise of the Progressive Party has broken the monopoly of the two parties over elections, according to Baldwin, \"the masses will no longer be apathetic in this election, which would have been the case if only Truman and Dewey were competing.\" Baldwin further predicted that the emergence of the Progressive Party on the American political stage will attract millions of voters who did not participate in the 1946 congressional elections to the polls. The American reactionaries, frightened by the development of the Progressive Party, are imposing various illegal obstacles on the party. In Truman's home state of Missouri, the state's Secretary of State Nelson announced on the 21st the decision that the Progressive Party has no right to campaign in Missouri. In Pennsylvania, Lenny, the Progressive Party's black candidate for Congress, was arrested and beaten by the police. The chairman of the Progressive Party in Missouri has appealed to the Supreme Court, and Lenny has also sued the state police for preventing his legal campaign. Commenting on Missouri's decision to ban the Progressive Party from participating in the election, Wallace pointed out that this was a brazen attempt by Truman and his Democratic Party followers to steal the state's election results. Wallace also said that Truman was clearly frightened by the overwhelming support the Progressive Party had gained among tens of millions of voters. \"I warn Truman that the people of Missouri will not tolerate another stolen election.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 进步力量联合阵线日益强大　美共正巩固扩大队伍　进步党将能在四十六州参加大选\n\n1948-09-05\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　进步力量联合阵线日益强大\n  　美共正巩固扩大队伍\n  　进步党将能在四十六州参加大选\n    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：劳动报于题为“两党制度的危机与美国进步党”一文中写道：美国新的进步党的兴起，乃是垄断的两党制度危机的直接结果，乃是美国人民日益不满于统治者反人民的内外政策的结果。进步党代表着弥漫于全美国的反帝国主义、反法西斯主义的情绪，并以广泛的联合阵线的姿态出现。它拥有大量工人、广大农民、进步自由职业者、城市中产阶级及被压迫的黑人的支持。所有这些社会阶层，都在维护民主权利与自由的共同愿望中团结起来了。这点已由进步党运动及该党全国代表大会所证明。该文继称：作为美国无产阶级独立的政党活动的美国共产党，宣布支持进步党争取和平、反通货膨胀与法西斯主义的政策。但是美共同时指出在某些基本的与策略的问题上，和华莱士有分歧。据最近报纸消息，美国共产党正在巩固与扩大其队伍，加强劳动群众的联合战线，并努力于美国劳动人民行动的统一，以促进民主和平与自由。该文结语称：美国进步力量反独占资本的联合阵线，其力量与规模正与日俱增，乃是一个不可辩驳的事实。\n    【新华社陕北一日电】各方报导：据进步党竞选运动主任鲍尔温最近宣称：新党将能在美国四十八州中之四十四州至四十六州，参加十一月大选。仅在佛罗里达与俄克拉荷马两州，进步党才确定地被拒绝参加竞选。由于进步党的兴起打破了两党对选举的垄断，据鲍氏宣称：“这次竞选中群众不会再有漠不关心的现象，而假如只有杜鲁门与杜威对抗，这种现象是会有的。”鲍氏进而预料，进步党在美国政治舞台上的出现，将吸引不曾参加一九四六年国会选举的千百万选民到选举站来。美国反动派慑于进步党的发展，正对该党施以各种非法的刁难。在杜鲁门故乡的密苏里州，该州州务部长纳尔逊于廿一日宣布了进步党无权在密苏里州竞选的决定。在宾夕法尼亚州，进步党的黑人众议员候选人伦尼，竟被警察逮捕与殴伤。密苏里州进步党主席已向最高法院申诉，伦尼亦已控告该州警察阻止其合法竞选。华莱士在评论密苏里州决定禁止进步党参加竞选时指出：这是杜鲁门及其民主党徒众企图窃取该州选举结果的厚颜行为。华氏又称：杜鲁门显然是被进步党在成千万选民中获得的势不可当的支持所吓慌了。“我警告杜鲁门，密苏里的人民是不会容忍再有盗窃的选举的。”"

    "title": "Introduction to \"72\" Wheat",
    "author": "Guo Yimin",
    "date": "1948-09-06",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Introduction to \"72\" Wheat\n    Guo Yimin\n\n    I. Origin of the Variety: \"72\" wheat is an excellent variety bred before the \"July 7th Incident.\" It was widely planted around Qingfengdian in Ding County. Later, it was gradually promoted to the Tang River basin and the Guangli Canal area. However, because the masses did not pay attention to seed selection, this excellent variety has undergone some changes due to gradual hybridization. The six-edged head, six large edges, flat head, big head man, and \"qi si feng\" (wind-resistant) wheat currently planted by the masses in the Guangli Canal area of Tang County, although with diverse names, have roughly the same characteristics and traits as \"72\" wheat. However, the color and appearance are slightly inferior and not as attractive as \"72\" wheat.\n\n    II. Planting Method: The cultivation method is the same as for ordinary wheat. The sowing period is from the Autumn Equinox to the Cold Dew. The masses in the Guangli Canal area generally apply grass manure and sow with a seed drill, using seven or eight *shi* (市) *sheng* (升) of seeds per *mu* (亩). If black beans and oil cake are also applied with the seed drill, eight or nine *shi sheng* of seeds per *mu* are required. If broadcasting, only one or two *shi sheng* of seeds are needed. The maturity period is one or two days later than ordinary wheat. \"72\" wheat has tall, thick, and hard stalks and is very wind-resistant, commonly known as \"qi si feng.\" Its resistance to jaundice is also very strong. The wheat grains are white, large, short, and thick, also known as \"big head man\" or \"击鼓麦\" (drum wheat). \"72\" wheat has deep roots and can absorb more nutrients.\n\n    III. Yield: If sufficient fertilizer is applied, \"72\" wheat can yield up to 30 *shi dou* (市斗) per *mu*, which is 10 *shi dou* more than the highest yield of other wheat. Luo Kuizi, a villager in Beiluo Village of a certain county, planted 1.7 *mu* of \"72\" wheat last year, applying 80 loads (approximately 27 carts) of grass manure per *mu*, and harvested more than 23 *shi dou* of wheat per *mu*. With the same fertilizer and management methods, other wheat yielded 12 *shi dou* per *mu*. This year, he planted 1.7 *mu* of \"72\" wheat again, applying 70 loads of grass manure and 10 pieces of oil cake, and harvested 16 *shi dou* per *mu*. The \"line wheat\" (线麦), managed in the same way, yielded 10 *shi dou* per *mu*. According to him, the previous crop was corn stalks last year, and this year it was millet stalks, so the yield was slightly lower. Yang Luopei, a villager in Zhu Beiluo, planted 1.5 *mu* of \"big head man\" wheat the year before last, applying 10 large carts of hot manure (freshly taken from the pen) and 20 pieces of oil cake per *mu*, and harvested 27 *shi dou* per *mu*. Kang Luomei has continuously planted \"72\" wheat for five or six years, with an average yield of three to four *shi dou* more per *mu* than ordinary wheat each year. In the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), when jaundice was most severe, ordinary wheat yielded only three or four *shi dou*. \"72\" wheat still yielded 15 *shi dou*. The above villages have sticky soil, sown around the Autumn Equinox, and frozen water is applied before the Beginning of Winter. The following year, the first watering is done after Grain Rain, followed by hoeing with a large hoe. The second watering is done twenty days later, and the third watering is done another twenty days later. If hoeing follows watering, the wheat will be more drought-resistant and the harvest will be better. Three waterings are enough to ensure maturity. If watered again about half a month later, not only is it easier to pull when harvesting, but the wet soil also facilitates early planting of other crops. Sandy loam soil is cultivated in the same way as sticky soil, except that frozen water is not applied. Chen Luoshou, a villager in Dongxiasu, has continuously planted \"72\" wheat for two years. Last year, he applied 16 carts of grass manure per *mu* and harvested 13 *shi dou*, while ordinary wheat yielded a little more than 10 *shi dou*. It is said that the initial color of \"72\" wheat was very white, but it has turned red in the past two years (due to soil properties). Shi Luogen, a villager in Xixiasu, planted \"72\" wheat this year, applying 15 carts of fertilizer per *mu*, and harvested 23 *shi dou*, while ordinary wheat yielded less than 10 *shi dou*.\n\n    IV. Wheat Comparison: In the past, because \"72\" wheat had large grains and thick skin, the masses feared that it would produce less flour, and the price of its flour was slightly lower than that of other wheat flour. In recent years, according to the experience of many people, \"72\" wheat flour can be used in various foods, and the price is only slightly different from that of ordinary flour. Some people have tested that \"72\" wheat does not produce less flour, but it is a bit refined, short, brittle. Each *dou* of \"72\" wheat weighs 16 *shi jin* (市斤), and can produce 13.5 *jin* of flour. The experiences and results of the masses and farms are consistent.\n\n    \"72\" wheat is especially suitable for planting in low-lying and jaundice-prone areas. Its significant advantages are: 1.

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-06",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Mailbox\n\n　　What is \"Cross-Progressive Wage System\"?\n    Question: Comrade Chen Yun recently advocated the implementation of a cross-progressive wage system in his labor conference report. What is a \"cross-progressive wage system\"?\n    Answer: The cross-progressive wage system is a wage grading system. Why is it called cross-progressive? Because there are two main issues in the wage grading system: first, the problem of grade arrangement; second, the problem of the difference between grades. The cross-progressive wage system means that the grade arrangement is crosswise, and the difference between grades is progressive.\n    First, why is the grade arrangement crosswise? Because the labor nature of various employees (such as skilled workers, technicians, technical personnel, management personnel, etc.) in various enterprises (such as cotton weaving, machinery manufacturing, etc.) is different, the standards for stipulating wage grades are also different, either according to technical level, or according to responsibility, or according to skill level, or according to strength, etc. Since grades are stipulated separately according to various different standards, the wage grades of various enterprises and various employees will inevitably be arranged in a crisscrossing form, and it is impossible to arrange them together into a single grade sequence. A simple analogy: Assuming that the minimum wage for ordinary workers in a certain enterprise is 100, and the maximum wage is 180; the minimum wage for skilled workers may be 120, and the maximum wage may be 250; the minimum wage for technical workers may be 150, and the maximum wage may be 350. This makes them cross each other. At the same time, each type of employee is divided into several grades and levels based on skills, responsibilities, qualifications, and other conditions. The arrangement between grades is also in a crisscrossing manner, that is, the minimum wage of a first-grade, first-level worker can be lower than the maximum wage of a first-grade, second-level worker; the maximum wage of a first-grade, third-level worker can be higher than the minimum wage of a first-grade, second-level worker. Therefore, if all wage grades of various enterprises and various employees are combined into a chart, it will inevitably form a very complicated crisscrossing form. This method of grade arrangement is called a crosswise grading system. Conversely, if the wage of a first-grade, third-level worker is 150 to 210, a first-grade, second-level worker is 210 to 280, a first-grade, first-level worker is 280 to 350, or the wage of ordinary workers is 100 to 150, the wage of skilled workers is 150 to 220, and the wage of technical workers is 220 to 350, then these all become single ladder-shaped grading systems, not crosswise grading systems.\n    Second, why is the difference between grades progressive? Because no matter what kind of employee, once their skills and knowledge have reached a certain level, they must make greater efforts to improve further. Therefore, a more reasonable wage system should be such that the lower the grade, the shorter the distance between grades (smaller difference); the higher the grade, the longer the distance between grades (larger difference), so as to encourage employees to strive for progress. For example: the wage of a certain worker can be divided into thirteen levels, assuming that the thirteenth level is 100 points, each level above increases by 5 points, from the eighth level and above, it is changed to an increase of 8 points per level; from the fourth level and above, it is changed to an increase of 12 points per level, until the highest level is 200 points, which is a progressive grading system. Conversely, if the distance between each level is equal and progresses according to level, it is an equal difference grading system, not a progressive grading system.\n    This cross-progressive wage grading system is a reasonable wage system based on the principle of \"more work, more pay\" and suitable for the actual labor conditions of various enterprises and various employees. The implementation of this wage system will enable employees with various technical and production management experience and capabilities to receive reasonable treatment, and greatly encourage employees to learn. Except for small enterprises with very small production and operation scale, very simple production process, and few types of employees, which do not yet have the conditions for implementation, most large-scale enterprises and factories should implement this wage system, which is conducive to the development of production. The theory and implementation of the wage system should be discussed in separate articles, and only a simple answer can be given here.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　[Xinhua News Agency Northeast Electricity]\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 什么是“交叉累进工资制”？\n\n1948-09-06\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社信箱\n\n　　什么是“交叉累进工资制”？\n    问：最近陈云同志在劳动大会报告中主张实行交叉累进工资制，什么叫做“交叉累进工资制”？\n    答：交叉累进工资制是一种工资等级制度。为什么说是交叉累进呢？因为工资等级制度中主要有两个问题：一、等级排列的问题；二、等级之间的差额问题。交叉累进工资制就是说等级排列是交叉的，等级间的差额是累进的。\n    第一、为什么等级排列是交叉的？因为各种企业（如棉织业机器制造业………等）之中，各种职工（如技术工人、熟练工人、技术人员、管理人员………等）的劳动性质不同，所以规定工资等级的标准也不一样，或按技术高低，或按责任轻重，或按熟练程度，或按强度大小………，既然按照各种不同标准分别规定等级，那末各种企业各种职工的工资等级必然排列成为上下交叉的形式，而不可能混在一起排列成一个单一的等级序列。简单譬喻：假设某种企业的普通工人最低工资为一○○，最高工资为一八○；熟练工人最低工资也许是一二○，最高工资可以是二五○；技术工人最低工资也许是一五○，最高工资可以是三五○。这样就使彼此成为交叉。同时每种职工又根据技能、职责、资历等等条件，在本身中，分成几等几级，等级之间，也是采取这种交叉式的排列，即是一等一级工人的最低工资可以低于一等二级的最高工资；一等三级的最高工资可以高于一等二级的最低工资。因此如将所有各种企业各种职工工资等级合并列成图表，必然形成极错综的上下交叉的形式，这种等级排列的办法名为交叉的等级制。反之，如果一等三级工人的工资是一五○至二一○，一等二级是二一○至二八○，一等一级是二八○至三五○，或者是普通工人工资是一○○至一五○，熟练工人工资是一五○至二二○，技术工人工资是二二○至三五○，这就都成为单一梯形的等级制，而不是交叉的等级制了。\n    第二、为什么等级的差额是累进的？因为不论何种职工，他的技能学识已达到一定程度以后，如再求提高，就必须付出更大的努力。因此，比较合理的工资制度，应是等级愈低，等级间的距离愈短（差额小）；等级愈高，则等级间的距离随之放长（差额大），这才能鼓励职工力求进步。譬如：某种工人的工资可分为十三级，假设其第十三级为一○○分，以上每进一级增加五分，自第八级以上，改为每级增加八分；自第四级以上，改为每级增加十二分，直到最高一级为二○○分，这就是累进的等级制。反之，如果每级距离相等，按级递进，即是等差的等级制，而不是累进的等级制了。\n    这种交叉的累进的工资等级制，是根据多劳多得的原则，适合各种企业各种职工实际的劳动情况的合理的工资制度，这种工资制度的实行，将使具有各种技术与生产管理经验能力之职工得到合理的待遇，并大大鼓励职工的学习。除了生产经营规模甚小，生产过程十分简单，职工种类不多的小企业，还不具有施行的条件以外，一般较大规模的企业工厂都应实行这种工资制度，对于发展生产是有利的。关于工资制度的理论与实施，应另有专文，于此只能做简单的答复。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　【新华社东北电】"

The broad masses of laboring women in the Hebei, Chahar, Jehol, and Liaoning areas have played a significant role in agricultural and sideline production, supporting the front lines, and participating in political power work. Women cadres in Koubuyingzi Village, Beipiao, mobilized 110 women from the whole village to deliver fertilizer to 300 mu of land and participate in planting 2,000 mu; most of them directly participated in major labor such as rush planting, and more than 30 women learned how to plow and filter fertilizer. Therefore, they began to break the masses' long-held view that women cannot participate in major labor. In Yutian, Baodi, Pinggu, Luanxian, Leting and other counties in eastern Hebei, spinning and weaving are the main sideline production, and in some districts, almost every household spins and weaves cloth. Eastern Jehol is a cotton-producing area, and women's spinning is also very developed in Suizhong, Chaoyang, Jinxi and other counties. According to statistics from seven villages in Suizhong and other places, more than 40 percent of the 2,300 women participated in spinning and weaving. In supporting the front lines, they not only sent their husbands and sons to join the army, but many military families also personally cultivated the land and did not require assistance. Women in the second district of Yutian, eastern Hebei, organized 54 stretchers and transported the wounded in the rain. In rural areas, women mostly take on the tasks of guarding posts, sentry duty and delivering letters. In Shun Jiao and Di Gu villages in Baodi, 58 women voluntarily participated in sabotaging enemy transportation in one instance. During the Yanggezhuang battle in Leting, more than 40 women from Bianliuhe, Liuzhuang and other villages voluntarily went to the front line to rush to transport the wounded and deliver water and food, and persisted in working on the front line. After the land reform, the women's political awareness has been greatly improved, and they actively participate in various political activities and political power work.

    "content": "[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Dispatch] Insect pests have been discovered in parts of villages in fourteen counties within the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Ninth Sub-regions. The Regional Party Committee has called for emergency eradication. Various locations are currently engaged in eradication efforts. In Yanggu County of the Ninth Sub-region, parts of villages in the First, Fourth, and Seventh Districts have discovered insect pests. The insects are about six or seven fen (approximately 2 cm) long and come in three colors: yellow, red, and patterned. One type of insect is called \"@ Emperor insect,\" and another is called \"boring insect.\" In the morning, they climb to the heart of the corn stalks, with at least two to four insects per stalk. In the afternoon, they go halfway down the corn stalk and hide in the leaf sheaths, becoming more difficult to extract the harder you try. Upon discovering the pests, the sub-district committees immediately arranged inspections and mobilized the masses to eradicate them. Currently, over two hundred mu of millet have been saved. On the 25th evening, the county held an emergency meeting specifically to study eradication methods. After the meeting, teams were dispatched to the affected areas to lead the eradication efforts. In Shou Zhang County, hairy caterpillars have been widely discovered in the First, Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Districts, with the First and Sixth Districts being the most severely affected; the corn has already been eaten clean! In Fan County's First District, the area affected by the insect plague covers about seven to eight li, and some corn has already been eaten clean. The masses lack confidence in eradication, and the leadership is not resolute, lacking confidence, leading to the spread and expansion of the insect plague. Attention has now been paid, and eradication efforts are being led. In Neihuang County's First District, only nine out of seventy-four villages are not infested, with twenty-seven villages being the most severely affected; one-third of the corn has been eaten. Some villages have lost half of their crops. The masses in villages such as Yangliu Village, Houliu Village, Wangying, and Hanchao Village launched surprise attacks and have now mostly eradicated the pests. After the insect plague was discovered in the Second District of Shanghe, the county headquarters led the masses to go to the fields together to eradicate the pests, eliminating the insects on more than forty mu of land in one afternoon, ensuring that the grain harvest will not be reduced. Insects have also appeared in Dongke Zhuohezhai and Xiaolou in the Third District. According to incomplete statistics, the crops on more than fifty mu of land have been damaged. The village cadres of Yulintou Village specifically assigned leadership, ensuring that no crops were damaged. They organized groups of eight to ten people, with one village cadre leading two groups. Because the division of labor was clear and manpower was not wasted, progress was rapid, and two hundred people eradicated the insects on forty mu of millet fields in one day. After insects were discovered in Nanxiao Village in the Fourth District of Kunwu, some old women burned incense and prayed to the gods, resulting in crop damage. Resolute eradication efforts protected the seedlings. A total of fourteen counties in the region have discovered insect plagues. The Regional Party Committee has called on cadres, personnel, and rural branch members of Party, government, and military at all levels to immediately organize forces in areas where insect plagues have been discovered to lead the masses in eradication efforts. It is imperative to quickly eliminate the pests and resolutely prevent their spread and development. In the process of pest eradication, cadres and Party members should personally take action, stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses, and carry forward the spirit of the 1944 locust control campaign. Concentrate the various experiences of the masses and create various methods, such as organizing various forms of mutual assistance and adopting commendation and reward measures. Finally, it is proposed that in order to eradicate insect pests, it is necessary to vigorously organize mutual assistance on a voluntary and equivalent basis, eliminate wasteland, strive to plant all wasteland during the autumn plowing and sowing movement, and cultivate the areas where insect pests have been discovered in order to eliminate the breeding and prevent future troubles.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫部分地区发现虫灾　区党委号召紧急扑灭\n\n1948-09-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫部分地区发现虫灾\n  　区党委号召紧急扑灭\n    【冀鲁豫电】四、五、六、八、九各分区内十四个县，部分村庄，发现虫害。区党委号召紧急扑灭。现各地正在扑打中。九分区阳谷一、四、七区都有部分村庄发现虫害，虫的形状有六七分长，有黄、红、花三种颜色，另一种虫名叫＠皇虫，一种叫钻心虫。早晨爬到棒子尖上的心里，每棵至少二个至四个，上午到棒子秸的半截，钻在叶库里不出来，越拿他越向里钻。各区分委会发觉后随即布置检查，同时动员群众扑打。现二百来亩谷子，全被救出。二十五日晚该县举行紧急会议，专门研究扑杀办法。会后即分赴各虫灾区，领导扑灭。寿张县，一、三、五、六、八各区，普遍发现毛虫，一、六区较重，棒子已经吃光！范县一区发现虫灾方圆约七八里，有的棒子已吃光，群众没信心扑杀，领导上不坚决，缺乏信心，闹得虫灾蔓延扩大，现已开始注意，领导扑杀。内黄一区七十四个村，只有九个村没生虫，有二十七个村最严重，棒子三分之一被吃光。有的村吃到二分之一。杨刘村、侯刘村、王营、汉晁村等村的群众突击扑打，现在已大部打完了。尚和二区发现虫灾后，县指挥部领导群众一齐下地扑打，一晌就消灭了四十多亩地的虫子，谷子也可不减收。三区东科浊河砦、肖楼一带也出虫了，据不完全统计，有五十多亩地庄稼被吃坏了。榆林头村干具体分工领导，不损坏一棵庄稼，他们每八人至十人为一个组，一个村干代领二个组，因为分工明确，不浪费人力，进行的很快，二百人一天扑灭了四十亩谷地的虫子。昆吾四区南小区发现虫子后，有的老婆婆烧香求神，结果庄稼被吃坏了。坚决打的把青苗保护了。全区共有十四个县均已发现虫灾。区党委已号召各级党政军民干部人员及农村支部党员，发现虫灾的地区应立即组织力量，领导群众进行扑打。务必迅速消灭，决不使其蔓延发展。在扑虫中干部和党员亲自下手，发挥群众的积极性，发扬一九四四年扑蝗运动的精神。集中群众中的各种经验，创造各种办法，如组织各种各样互助，并表扬记功等奖励办法。最后提出为了根绝虫患，必须在自愿及等价基础上大力组织互助，消灭荒地，争取在秋耕秋种运动中把荒地全部种上，并把发现虫患的地耕好，以消灭虫＠繁衍而绝后患。"

No matter where we fight, enemies several times our size cannot move us; if they do not surrender, they can only be annihilated. On July 12th, after we captured Dachang Town and annihilated the Provisional 34th Army, the Zhao Chengzhou group, which had long been heavily besieged, had only two divisions left, compressed into the small villages of Xifan and Xiaochang. Zhao Chengzhou even stuffed his headquarters and the 33rd Army headquarters into Xifan Village, which had less than fifty households, and stubbornly waited for reinforcements. This was obviously a posture of being beaten, a posture of preparing to be annihilated. This was a fierce battle, and this battle determined Zhao Chengzhou's fate as a prisoner.\n　　On the morning of the 14th, after a fierce artillery bombardment, Wang Siniu, the deputy platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon of a certain company, led his assault group to the enemy's front line. But when he looked back, there were only seven or eight people left. It turned out that the enemy had learned a lesson from the annihilation at Dachang Town and, fearing the killing power of our fierce artillery fire, used the three water channels outside the village to construct fortifications, linking and surrounding Xifan and Xiaochang villages. They deployed their light and heavy weapons and main forces there. When our powerful artillery fire fiercely bombarded, they hid in the bomb shelters built using the water channels, making it difficult to detect them. When Wang Siniu rushed to within a dozen meters of the enemy, the smoke raised by our artillery fire disappeared, and a row of black machine guns appeared in front of Wang Siniu, suddenly spewing out several rows of bullets. So he discovered the reason why only seven or eight of them could rush up. This was an open area several hundred meters wide, and it was dangerous to show one's head even slightly. They clung to the cornfield, which was only a foot high, and used shovels to push the soil in front of their heads, trying to use it to temporarily cover themselves, preparing to attack immediately.\n　　After a burst of small artillery fire and rifle grenades, the enemy, wearing steel helmets and wielding bayonets, rushed over. A volley of grenades drove the enemy back, but the enemy's bullets also pierced through the soil that temporarily sheltered them. One comrade sacrificed himself, and another was wounded.\n　　After repeatedly defeating the enemy's two counterattacks, only five people were left: Wang Siniu, Yang Cheng, Song Caishun, Li Tiancheng, and Liang Youxing. Only thirteen grenades and ten bullets were left. The soldiers became afraid and whispered:\n　　\"Oh dear! What shall we do when we run out of bullets?\"\n　　Siniu said: \"It doesn't matter. If the enemy comes, throw a volley of grenades first, leaving two. Then fire two shots, leaving three bullets. Fix bayonets and fight them when the enemy comes. The machine guns behind us will definitely cover us.\"\n　　After the enemy's fifth counterattack, there were only two grenades and two rifle bullets left. The soldiers were afraid again. Siniu dared not send anyone back to get ammunition, fearing that the person sent back would be wounded. So he discussed with everyone:\n　　\"If you can guarantee that we won't lose the position, I can guarantee that I'll bring back bullets.\"\n　　Yang Cheng said: \"If you guarantee that you'll bring back bullets, I guarantee that I'll repel the enemy's counterattack. If we lose the position, you can have my head. If the bullets run out, I'll fight with my bayonet.\"\n　　Siniu crawled back and brought back eight grenades and fifty bullets. Everyone was very happy. It was noon, the sun was shining directly, there was no wind, and the corn leaves were curled up. The sweat on people's bodies seemed to be wrung dry. Everyone was dizzy, their eyes were black, their hearts were anxious, their mouths were sticky, and taking a few Rendan pills didn't help. Their tongues were dry and parched, and they didn't seem to be very nimble. The soldiers whispered again:\n　　\"Platoon leader, it's too dry, it's too dry....\"\n　　Siniu crawled back, even drier than them. But he knew that the kitchen hadn't sent water yet, and there was nothing to drink behind them. He remembered the encouragement they had given him in previous battles, and he said to everyone: \"We are fighting a nail-in-the-ground battle. Our comrades are brave and tenacious. Wherever we fight, we must stick like a nail!\"\n　　The soldiers became quiet when they heard this sentence. Then he added: \"We have already repelled the enemy's five counterattacks. Can we lose the position again because of thirst? If we retreat, just the few of us, three or four would be wounded, and the enemy would chase us. That would be too embarrassing, too uneconomical.\"\n　　After he said this, the soldiers' hearts brightened. Then, water and ammunition were crawled and sent over, and the enemy, from then on, only fired small artillery and rifle grenades, but dared not come out again.\n　　Who says we are not fighting a nail-in-the-ground battle? There are many such things. Company Commander Feng Quanzhu and Platoon Leader Jiang Yupen also led their comrades to repel the enemy's six counterattacks, and then fought with the enemy three times at night, taking down a bunker. We consolidated our position on the enemy's front line.\n　　2. If there are more enemies, defeat them.\n　　On the night of the 14th, Zhao Chengzhou, under the fierce attack of our artillery fire, sneaked into Xiaochang Village. They had already issued an order to break through at 9:00 p.m. on the 15th. But at 7:30 p.m. that night, the sound of the People's Liberation Army's attack artillery rang out. We set off from the position we had already acquired, extended the communication trenches, and prepared to attack the isolated small temple in the northeast of the village from the front, and then break into the village from there.\n　　This time, the 2nd Company rushed up and blew up the small temple. Because of the killing power of the enemy's flanking fire, the follow-up troops could not come up and could not advance. Comrade Bi Sanlou of the 1st Company led the assault group and rushed to the enemy's single-person bunker with a volley of grenades, but was also beaten back. The second time, the company commander followed him. Bi Sanlou attacked again but was beaten back. He reported to the company commander: \"The enemies are all hiding in single-person bunkers, there are many of them...\"\n　　The company commander said: \"If there are more enemies, then fight them; can we make them fewer by not fighting?\"\n　　So the company commander and them together threw another volley of grenades, and the enemies jumped out of the single-person bunkers and fled to the small temple.\n　　Suddenly, a shell fell with a sound like a cloth bag hitting the wall. It was very clear in the moonlight: a puff of gray smoke and a puff of white smoke intertwined and came out. Company Commander's Feng Jinxian's mouth and nose flowed with acid, his throat felt a burning sensation; his head was dizzy, and everything in his eyes was blue. He quickly sprinkled some urine on the mask and put it on, but it was too late. The enemy had released poison gas, covering an area fifty meters wide and seventy or eighty meters deep. All the soldiers in the battalion were lying on the ground, unable to get up. At this time, it was extremely dangerous. But we organized the firepower on both wings to block the area and protect the poisoned comrades, and the enemy did not dare to come down.\n　　3. Advance in the artillery fire.\n　　Two hours later, our artillery fire fell on the enemy's fortifications. Lightning-like flames burst out in the night sky, and the enemies all shrank into the bomb shelters. They still wanted to follow the old rules and jump out to meet our infantry attack after our shells were finished. They were so terrified that they shouted blindly everywhere:\n　　\"Get ready, the enemy is coming.\"\n　　\"Get ready, the enemy is coming.\"\n　　But the soldiers of the 5th Company of our 3rd Battalion jumped forward amidst the sound of the artillery explosions. They were very familiar with the places where our shells were about to fall. Before a volley of artillery had finished, the demolition team Li Meizhen and An Jiuyue had already placed the demolition poles against the back wall of the small temple. When our shells finished, the demolition team pulled the firing line, and a room of the small temple collapsed.\n　　At this time, the small temple could not hide the enemies anymore. The enemies hiding in the fortifications in the southwest corner of the temple were still firing at us from the side. Zhao Kaoxiang, the deputy platoon leader of the 3rd Platoon, quickly led the 9th Squad up and drove the enemies in the northern trench of the temple to the southern trench with a volley of grenades. They immediately broke into the small temple and threw grenades around the temple. Liberated soldier Niu Sanfu was wounded. Squad Leader Liu Haihe of the 9th Squad said to him: \"I am also wounded, it's nothing, it's better to eliminate the enemy than anything else!\" They brushed their wounds as if brushing away dust, and continued to fight. It was almost dawn, and the enemies east of the temple had not retreated. Deputy Squad Leader Gang ran over to blow it up, but the enemies counterattacked and he was wounded. They threw a volley of grenades and suppressed the enemies into the trench. Liu Haihe and Niu Sanfu climbed to the top of the trench and threw a volley of grenades. Some of the enemies fled, and some were still in the trench. Wang Xiaojiu and Li Gonglin jumped into the trench, climbed up through the trench, and blew up a dilapidated house east of the temple. Before the bricks lifted by the explosives had finished falling, the 6th Company had broken into the village from their breach.\n　　This small temple faced east. In front of the temple gate, the enemies built a north-south communication trench, which was connected to the fortifications around the outside of their village. No matter where we broke in, we could be attacked by the enemy's flanking fire. However, when the 6th Company broke into the village, the 4th Company had already held off the enemies in the trench south of the temple and expanded the breach to the south. Squad Leader Liu Haihe of the 9th Squad also led his squad to drive out all the enemies in the northern communication trench. A pair of hard \"walnut shells\" was broken.\n　　4. Regardless of everything, crush the enemy.\n　　After the \"walnut shell\" was smashed, the soldiers charged bravely. All ten or so members of the assault group of the 6th Company were wounded, but none of them left the front line. They completely forgot about themselves. Some knew that they were wounded, while others lost the sense of pain in the intense battle and did not know that they were wounded at all. Company Commander Liang Dexiang was wounded three times, Platoon Leader Du Huangqiu was wounded twice, and Squad Leader Lu Yaoting of the 2nd Squad was also wounded twice. However, they did not want the soldiers to know this, and the soldiers also knew their psychology, and just gently and considerately said: \"Company Commander, there is something red on your body!\" The company commander said \"It doesn't matter\", waved his hand, and led the soldiers to charge again.\n　　When they occupied the first courtyard and repelled the enemy's counterattack, they ran out of ammunition. The soldiers picked up the bullets scattered on the ground by the enemy and fired them, and took the ammunition from the prisoners. The enemy had been besieged for nearly ten days, and they did not have much ammunition either. When the second courtyard was blown up, Platoon Leader Du Huangqiu grabbed the ladder and went up to the roof. The enemies also came up from the opposite side. They thought they were their own people and quickly asked:\n　　\"Which part are you from?\"\n　　\"The People's Liberation Army is here!\" Zhu Guiqiu said, giving him a grenade and a rifle shot. The enemy cried out and rolled off the roof. The enemies at the bottom of the roof shouted: \"They are on the roof\", and threw grenades up from below. Zhu Guiqiu's grenades also ran out. He was just saying to the soldiers: \"If the enemies come up, throw bricks at the son of a bitch!\" Company Commander Yang Dexiang told him to come down quickly. As soon as he jumped off the ladder, there was a loud bang, and the courtyard was blown up again. They could not see anything in the smoke, and rushed to the third string of courtyards; there, the enemies were separated from them by a wall, and the grenades they threw could not reach them. They threw two incendiary bombs and fired two bursts of machine gun fire, suppressing the enemies. The fourth string of courtyards was the enemy's division headquarters. Those big officials were more afraid of death than the soldiers and had already fled, leaving behind crisscrossing telephone lines at the door.\n　　When the division headquarters fled, the enemy collapsed across the board, like a group of ants whose nest had been smashed, desperately running towards Xiaochang Village from all directions. Some fell as soon as they got up, and some fell and then got up again. Some crawled, some rolled. At this time, the commanders and fighters stood up excitedly, clapping their hands to watch our artillery's fire pursuit. Our artillery shells followed the enemy's footsteps, exploding violently amidst their screams...\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 勇猛攻占西范村\n耿西\n1948-09-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　勇猛攻占西范村\n    耿西\n  　一、“我们打的是钉子仗”。\n    “同志们英勇顽强，\n    我们打的是‘钉子仗’；\n    无论打到哪里，\n    就跟钉在哪里一样。”\n    目前，在我们部队里，这样的口号已经很流行了。我们无论打到哪里，多少倍的敌人也无法攻动，如果他们不投降，便只有被歼灭了。七月十二号，我们攻占了大常镇，歼灭暂三十四军以后，早已陷入重重包围之中的赵承绶集团，只剩两个师，被压缩在西范和小常两个小村了。赵承绶还把他的总部和三十三军军部，塞在不满五十口人家的西范村，固守待援，这当然是一副挨打的架子，一种准备就歼的姿态。这是一场激烈的战斗，这战斗决定了赵承绶必然当俘虏的命运。\n    十四号清晨，一阵猛烈的炮击之后，某连二排副王四牛带着他的突击组冲到敌人的前沿。但他回头一看，只剩七八个人了。原来敌人接受了大常镇被歼的教训，害怕我们猛烈炮火的杀伤，利用村外三道水渠构成工事，把西范和小常村联结环绕起来，轻重火器和主力也都布置在那里了。当我们强大的炮火猛烈轰击的时候，他们躲在利用水渠修成的避弹坑里，很难发觉。等王四牛冲到离敌人十几米达的时候，我们的炮火所扬起的灰烟消失了，一排黑乌乌的机枪，出现在王四牛的面前，蓦地冒出几排子弹。于是他发现了他们只有七八个人能冲上来的原因。这里是一片好几百米达宽的开阔地，稍一露头便有危险。他们紧贴在只有尺把来高的玉茭地里，用铁锹把头脑前面的土推了推，想利用它暂时遮掩一下，准备马上出击。\n    一阵小炮，一阵枪榴弹过后，敌人戴着钢盔，掂着刺刀扑过来了，他们一排手榴弹把敌人打回去，敌人的子弹也穿透了他们临时遮身的积土。一个同志牺牲了，一个同志挂了彩。\n    接连着又打垮了敌人两次反扑，这时候只剩下王四牛、杨诚、宋才顺、李天成、梁有兴等五个人了，手榴弹还剩了十三个，子弹只有十发了。\n    第四次打垮敌人反扑以后，敌人有三个彩号，躺在地下只哼哼，旁边还有三个敌人看着他们不走了。王四牛心里着急起来，他和大家说：“这三个人不走怎样办呢？他们看出我们就只五个人那就糟了。”临汾解放战士李天成拿起一颗手榴弹说：“我爬上去给他一家伙，看它走不走。”手榴弹一响，只听哎呀一声，那三个家伙跑了，挂彩的敌人也再不哼哼了。这时候他们又接着打了敌人一阵，只剩下五颗手榴弹，五粒子弹了，战士们害了怕，小声的叫唤着：\n    “哎呀！没有子弹了怎样办？”\n    四牛说：“不要紧，敌人来了先打一排手榴弹，剩下两颗。再打它两枪，剩三粒子弹。上起刺刀来，敌人来了跟他拼，我们后面的机枪看到了一定要掩护咱们的。”\n    敌人五次反扑以后，就是只剩两颗手榴弹，两粒步枪子弹了。战士们又害怕了。四牛不敢打发人回去取弹药，害怕差回去的人再挂了彩，于是，他和大家商量说：\n    “你们能保证不失阵地，我就能保证拿回子弹来。”\n    杨诚说：“你保证拿回子弹来，我保证打退敌人反扑，丢了阵地，你要我的脑袋，子弹打完了，我用刺刀拼。”\n    四牛爬回去，拿了八颗手榴弹，五十发子弹来，大家很高兴。这时候天正晌午了，太阳直射着，一点风也没有，玉茭叶儿都卷起来了。人身上的汗水似乎都绞干了，大家头昏、眼黑、心焦、嘴里黏糊糊的，吃点仁丹也不顶事。舌头干的发燥，似乎不怎样灵便了，战士们又低声的叫唤着：\n    “排长，干的不行，干的不行呀………”\n    四牛爬回来，比他们干的更厉害。但是，他知道火房还没有送水来，后面也没喝的。他想起了历次战斗中给他们的鼓励，他给大家讲道：“我们打的是钉子仗，我们同志是英勇顽强的，打到那里就要钉在那里！”\n    战士们一听到这句话便安静了。接着他又补充道：“我们已经打退了敌人五次反扑了，还能因为渴再失了阵地，就我们这几个人，退回去也得挂彩三四个，敌人还要撵，那太丢人，太不上算了。”  　他这一讲，战士们心里明亮了。接着，后面的水、弹药都爬着送来了，而敌人从此以后，光打小炮，打枪榴弹，却不敢再出来了。\n    谁说我们打的不是钉子仗呢？这样的事情多得很，一连长冯全柱，三排长蒋玉盆同样带着他们的同志，打退了敌人六次反扑，晚上又与敌人争夺三次，拿下了一个地堡。我们巩固了在敌人前沿的阵地。\n    二、敌人多了，打垮它。\n    十四日晚上，赵承绶在我们炮火猛烈攻击之下，溜到小常村去了。他们已经下达了命令，准备十五号夜晚九点钟突围。但是，当晚七点半钟的时候，人民解放军攻击的炮声打响了，我们从已取得的阵地出发，伸长了交通壕，准备从正面攻占村东北的孤立小庙，再从那里突进村去。\n    这一次二连冲上去，爆破了小庙。因为敌人侧射火力的杀伤，后续部队上不来，不能前进了。一连毕三楼同志领着突击组，一溜手榴弹冲到敌人单人掩体前面，也被打下来了。第二次连长跟在他后面，毕三楼攻上去又被打下来了，他报告连长说：“敌人尽躲在单人掩体里，多得很……”\n    连长说：“敌人多了打嘛；不打还能少得了。”\n    于是连长和他们一起，又一阵手榴弹打上去，敌人从单人掩体里跳出来，逃到小庙里了。\n    突然，一颗炮弹，带着象土布袋打在墙上那样的声音落下来了。月亮地里看得很清楚：一股灰烟，一股白烟渗绞着冒出来，一连长口鼻里流出酸水，喉咙里一阵辣；脑袋发昏，眼睛里什么都是蓝蓝的了。他赶紧在口罩上撒些尿戴上去，但是，已经迟了。敌人放了毒，宽五十米，纵深七八十米以内尽是毒气，冯金弦跑下来和营长握了握手，便什么都不知道了。营长也中毒了。全营战士爬在地下起不来，这时候危险极了。但我们组织两翼的火力封锁，保护了中毒的同志，敌人也不敢下来了。\n    三、在炮火中跃进。\n    两个钟头以后，我们的排炮落到敌人的工事上了，夜空里爆出了闪电似的火光，敌人都龟缩到避弹坑里去了，他们还想循照老规矩，等我们炮弹发完了，再跳出来迎接我们的步兵攻击，他们恐怖得太厉害了，到处盲目的惊叫着：\n    “准备好，敌人上来了。”\n    “准备好，敌人上来了。”\n    但是，我们三营五连的战士，就在炮弹爆炸声中，跳跃着前进了，他们非常熟悉我们的炮弹将要落到的地方。一个排炮还没有落完，爆炸组李美珍和安九月已经把爆炸杆子靠到了小庙的后墙上，等我们的炮弹落完，爆炸组一拉火线，小庙的一间房子塌下来了。\n    这时候小庙里是藏不住敌人了的，庙西南角躲在工事里的敌人却还在向我们侧射。三排副赵考祥赶紧带着九班上去，一排手榴弹把敌人撵到庙南的壕沟里。他们马上突进小庙，向庙周围投弹。解放战士牛三福挂了彩，九班长刘海和跟他说：“我也挂了彩，没啥，把敌人消灭了比啥都好！”他们象拂去灰尘似的，拂了拂他们的伤口，又干起来。天快亮了，庙东的敌人还未退，五班副刚跑过去爆炸，敌人反扑过来挂了彩，他们一排手榴弹，把敌人压倒壕里。刘海和与牛三福爬到壕顶上投了一阵手榴弹，敌人有的逃跑了，有的还在壕沟里。王小九、李贡林便跳进壕里，又通过壕沟爬起来，爆破了庙东的一座破房子。被炸药掀起来的砖块还未落完，六连已从他们的爆破口突进村了。\n    这座小庙是座西朝东的。庙门前，敌人修了直通南北的交通壕，和他们村外四周的工事联结起来。我们从任何一点突进来，都可以遭到敌人的侧射。但是，六连突进村的时候，四连已经顶住庙南壕沟里的敌人，向南扩大缺口。九班长刘海和又带着他的班把北交通壕里的敌人都驱逐了。一双坚硬的“核桃壳”打破了。\n    四、不顾一切，摧垮敌人。\n    “核桃壳”砸破后，战士们勇猛的突击。六连的突击组十来个人全部挂了彩，没有一个下火线的。他们完全忘记了自己。有的挂了彩是自己知道的，有的则在紧张的战斗中，失掉了痛的感觉，根本不知道挂了彩。连长梁德相带了三次彩，一排长杜黄秋挂了两次，二班长吕耀庭也挂了两次。然而，他们不愿让战士们知道这一点，战士们也知道他们这种心理，只是轻轻的体贴的说：“连长，看你身上有了红的！”连长说声“不要紧”，一摆手又带着战士们冲击了。\n    占领了第一座院子，他们打退敌人的反扑时，把弹药打光了。战士们拾起敌人撒在地上的子弹打上去，收下俘虏身上的弹药打上去，敌人被围将近十天，弹药也不多了。第二座院子爆炸开，一排长杜黄秋抓住梯子就上房。敌人也从对面上，他们还以为是自己人，赶紧问：\n    “你是那一部分？”\n    “解放军来了！”朱贵秋一边说着，就给了他一手榴弹，再加一步枪，敌人唉呀一声，滚下房去了。房底下的敌人乱叫：“他们上房了”，从底下打上手榴弹来。朱贵秋的手榴弹又打光了，他正跟战士们说：“敌人上来了拿砖砸狗日的！”连长杨德相却叫他赶紧下来，他刚蹦下梯子，轰然一声巨响，那座院子又一次被爆炸了。他们在烟雾之中，什么也看不见，又冲到了第三串院子；那里敌人和他们隔着一道墙，手榴弹打过来探不到他们。他们打了两颗燃烧弹，两梭子机枪，便把敌人压下去了。第四串院是敌人的师部，那些大官们比士兵更怕死，早就逃跑了，门边上留下了纵横交错的电话线。\n    师部一逃跑，敌人全线溃乱了，象一群砸了窝的蚂蚁，从四面八方，拼命向小常村狂奔。他们有的刚爬起来又跌倒，有的跌倒了又爬起来。爬的爬，滚的滚。这时候，指战员们兴奋的立起身来，拍着手看我们炮兵的火力追击，我们的炮弹群跟着敌人的脚步，在他们的惊叫声中，猛烈爆炸着………。"

On the 6th of this month, the 12th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Hebei-Baoding Garrison, colluding with the local armed forces of the bandit Wang Delin's unit, more than 800 men in total, carrying 24 light and heavy machine guns and three mortars and small cannons, launched an all-out attack on our Eighth District in several directions, attempting to destroy the local people's armed forces and plunder grain and conscript soldiers. When the enemy came down from Nan Si Ling, they stepped on two landmines, wounding two men. When the enemy was busy tending to the wounded, our Ma Jie Gou militia and rotation team fired fiercely, covering the masses' evacuation from the village. When the enemy attacked us in three directions, the village militia and rotation team did not fire a shot, but quickly moved to the rear to set an ambush. When the enemy entered the ambush circle, we immediately fired with machine guns, rifles, and grenades, repelling the enemy. The enemy charged a second time, and the quick-witted militia and rotation team fought while retreating, then withdrew to both sides, luring the enemy deep. When the enemy reached Yang Quan, the three-way joint defense militia of the east, west, and center quickly concentrated and charged the Chiang bandits, covering the troops and killing or wounding eight enemies. The enemy fled in panic. On the way, a part of our rotation team intercepted them, killing or wounding more than 20 enemies. When the enemy fled to Ma Jie Gou and Long Dong, they again stepped on landmines, killing or wounding 10 men. The other two groups of enemies attacking the Eastern Joint Defense advanced to Zhong Wei Village, where the militia and another detachment concentrated their fire to block the enemy, continuously repelling 12 enemy assaults, covering the masses' evacuation. At the same time, they laid landmines and ambushed the enemy behind the village; when the enemy entered the village to loot grain, a soldier was killed by a landmine as soon as he pushed open a door. The village cadres led the militia to charge from the side, scattering the enemy. Running into the street, they stepped on another landmine, wounding one man. This forced the bandits to flee back along the mountain road. At this time, our 18th Detachment and two groups of militia joined forces to pursue the enemy, chasing them all the way to Twelve Association Ridge, wounding seven enemies and intercepting a portion of the grain. In total, in this battle lasting two hours, 17 enemies including the enemy company commander Gao Mingyi were killed, 31 enemies were wounded, one enemy was captured, and two rifles, more than 600 rounds of ammunition, and 13 grenades were seized. We only had two men wounded. The Fourth Special Prefecture, the Fourth Military Sub-district Command, and the Armed Forces Committee jointly issued a circular of commendation and awarded a bonus of 150,000 yuan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 博爱八区民兵轮战队　击退八百蒋匪\n\n1948-09-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　博爱八区民兵轮战队\n  　击退八百蒋匪\n    【太行电】博爱八区民兵和轮战队英勇作战，粉碎了四倍之敌的扫荡。本月六日，蒋冀保十二团纠合顽匪王德林部乡镇武装八百余人，携带轻重机枪二十四挺，迫击炮和小炮各三门，分数路向我八区全面进犯，企图摧垮该地人民武装，大肆抢粮抓丁。敌人由南寺岭下来时，即踏响地雷两颗，炸伤两名。我麻界沟民兵和轮战队乘敌拉伤兵时，猛烈射击，掩护群众转移出村。敌分三路向我进攻时，该村民兵轮战队一枪未发，迅速转移到后边设伏。敌进到伏击圈内，我即以机步枪手榴弹猛射，将敌击退。敌二次冲来，机敏的民兵轮战队边打边退，后即撤至两边、诱敌深入。敌进至羊圈时，我东西中三联防民兵迅速集中，猛冲蒋顽，掩护部队打死伤敌八名。敌慌忙回窜。途中我轮战队一部实行截击，打死伤敌二十余人。敌窜至麻界沟、龙洞时又踏响地雷，死伤十名。另两股向东联防进攻之敌进到中韦村时，民兵与另一支队集中火力阻击敌人，连续打退敌十二次冲锋，掩护群众转移出去。同时布设地雷，又埋伏于村后；敌进村抢粮，一推门，即被地雷炸死一名。该村干部带领民兵乘机从侧面冲上，打的敌人四散逃窜。跑到街上又踏响地雷，炸伤一名。逼使顽匪绕山路回逃。此时我十八支队和两股民兵会合追击敌人，将敌直追至十二会岭，伤敌七名，截回粮食一部。总共这次战斗，二点钟打死敌中队长郜明义以下十七名，打伤敌三十一名，俘敌一名，缴获步枪二支，子弹六百余发，手榴弹十三个，我仅伤二人。四专署、四分区司令部、武委会特联合通令表扬，并发给奖金十五万元。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, 2nd: In recent days, enemy planes, taking advantage of the emergency of the major flood, have intensified their raids on critical projects such as Gao Village on the south bank of the Yellow River. From the 12th to the 23rd of last month, the Gao Village critical project had already been bombed and strafed five times, resulting in the deaths of civilian laborers Chu Shidun and Li Erxuan, civilian laborer Li Shilang having one leg blown off, and three large material transport boats being destroyed. On the 13th and 15th, the area experienced fierce storms and torrential rains, with huge waves fiercely attacking the embankments, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Enemy planes frequently raided, causing the repair work to be halted, and three sections of the levee below Dam No. 18, totaling over a hundred meters, collapsed. Dam No. 18, which was still under construction, was also almost washed away. At the same time, on the 12th, 16th, and 17th, enemy planes repeatedly raided major critical projects such as Zhukou, Liuzhuang, and Linpu, destroying one of our material transport boats at Jiaoji. At 9:00 PM on the 17th, they strafed Nankai in Fan County for an hour, dropping six bombs, killing and injuring five residents.\n\nFurthermore, residents along the river in Dongming, witnessing engineering teams from various counties braving bombing and strafing by Kuomintang planes, as well as heavy rain, and bravely repairing the Yellow River critical projects day and night, on the 15th specifically brought comfort goods to express their appreciation.\n\n[Ji-Lu-Yu Dispatch] After the Gao Village critical project was turned from danger to safety, on the 24th of last month, all employees involved in the emergency repair conducted a summary of the rescue efforts and elected model engineering teams. The process began with the evaluation of merits and selection of models, preceded by seven days of deliberation and discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that the Kunwu Engineering Team, under the leadership of Captain Guo Youliang and Instructor Kong Qingzhen, disregarding the enemy situation and the disturbances from planes or the obstruction of wind and rain, consistently adhered to the emergency repair work, demonstrating a heroic and tenacious spirit. During the most critical times of the critical project, they always undertook the most difficult and dangerous engineering tasks of blocking major breaches, and were able to complete their missions. Therefore, they were awarded the First-Class Model Team. Secondly, the Dongming Team and the Shoubei Team were both selected as Second-Class Model Teams. On the evening of the same day, a celebration was held, and the Kunwu Team, amidst thunderous applause, received a model flag with the four large characters \"Turned the Tide.\" In addition to receiving double wages for August, technical personnel and engineering teams from each repair and defense section, as well as all personnel who persisted in the emergency repair work, were each awarded a single layer of clothing and a pair of shoes. The model team members of each team were awarded a towel each.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 敌机乘大汛频繁袭扰高村险工　民工奋不顾身日夜抢修　昆吾东明等工程队被选为模范队\n\n1948-09-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　敌机乘大汛频繁袭扰高村险工\n  　民工奋不顾身日夜抢修\n  　昆吾东明等工程队被选为模范队\n    【新华社华北二日电】连日来，敌机乘大汛紧急，袭扰黄河南岸高村等险工益剧。自上月十二日至二十三日，高村险工已被轰炸扫射五次，死民工褚石敦、李二玄二人，民工李石朗被炸断一条腿，运料大船被毁三只。十三日及十五日，该地狂风暴雨，洪涛巨浪猛扑堤坝，极为危险，而敌机频繁袭扰，抢修工程时遭停顿，第十八坝以下大堤有三段共百余公尺坍塌。尚未完工之十八坝亦几被冲走。同时十二、十六、十七等日，敌机并多次袭扰朱口、刘庄、临濮等大险工，在焦集毁我运料船一只。十七日午后九时，在范县南开扫射达一小时，投弹六枚，死伤居民五人。\n    又讯：东明沿河居民，目睹各县工程队冒国民党飞机轰炸扫射及暴雨，奋不顾身日夜抢修黄河险工，十五日特纷纷携带慰劳品，前往慰劳。\n    【冀鲁豫电】高村险工转危为安后，上月二十四日，全体抢险员工进行抢险总结和选举抢险模范工程队。首先进行评功选模，事前经过七天的酝酿讨论，大家一致认为昆吾工程队在队长郭友良和指导员孔庆珍同志领导下，不顾敌情和飞机的扰害或风雨阻难，始终坚持抢险工作，表现了英勇顽强的英雄气概，在险工最危急的时候，都是担任大溜顶冲非常艰险之工程，且能完成任务，因此荣获甲等模范队。其次，东明队及寿北队，均被选为乙等模范队。是日晚，举行庆祝会，昆吾队在掌声雷动中荣获“力转危局”四个大字的模范旗，各修防段的技术人员及工程队，除了八月份奖发双份工资外，各坚持抢险的人员，各奖单衣一身，和鞋子一双。各队的模范队员，每人奖毛巾一条。"

    "content": "Remarkable Results Achieved in New-Style Military Consolidation\n  　Attacking Power of a Certain Unit Enhanced\n  　Grand Celebration and Victory Meeting Held After the Pingbao Campaigns in Southern Chahar\n    [Pingbao Frontline News] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army solemnly held a celebration and victory meeting. In the Party consolidation and military consolidation before the Pingbao campaigns in southern Chahar, this unit strictly reviewed the phenomena of lax discipline in individual units, insufficient determination in carrying out orders, and even delays in military opportunities. Therefore, during the advance into southern Chahar, senior leaders of the brigade and regiment went deep into the companies, sharing joys and hardships with the commanders and fighters. During the five-day march, there were very few desertions, creating a new record for the unit's consolidation. After the launch of the campaign, they received the order for the siege of a certain city, crossed the Sanggan River in a 140-li rapid march, and surrounded the enemy who attempted to escape. Comrade Du Fuqing, the battalion commander of a certain battalion, used binoculars to count the bricks on the city wall, accurately calculating the height. After the attack was launched, the unit quickly ascended the city wall, and all one thousand defending enemies were annihilated. In the Pingbao campaign, the unit received an emergency order to launch a 120-li rapid march to encircle a certain city where bandits attempted to flee, and in coordination with friendly forces, ascended the city in seven minutes, annihilating all the defending enemies. In the two siege battles, all the defending enemies were annihilated, two cities were liberated, and the combat mission was successfully completed. In the siege, 2,241 people were recognized as people's heroes. To celebrate this glorious achievement, the unit held a military celebration and victory meeting in a certain place a few days ago. In addition to summarizing the successful experience, it also proposed: \"Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the leaders of the corps, resolutely implement orders, learn the skills of siege warfare, continue our efforts, and strive for thousands of heroes; call on all commanders and fighters to learn from the heroes, overcome all difficulties, resolutely complete the tasks, and strive for greater victories.\" All the commanders and fighters were extremely excited. After the meeting, Wang Yuqi, a major hero, said: \"From now on, if I have ten points of strength, I must not use only nine points. I must use unparalleled determination to respond to the call of the higher authorities, strive for the entire platoon to achieve meritorious service, and repay the people.\" The third company of a certain unit, which did not undertake the main attack last time, is now intensifying its martial arts training, preparing to take on the most arduous combat tasks.

The meeting determined that the main tasks of women's work in the future are: (1) Continue to mobilize women to participate in production, mainly agricultural production, followed by various household sideline productions, such as weaving, raising livestock, and poultry. Organize various forms of labor exchange and mutual assistance for women, commend and reward diligent women, and criticize and educate women who do not work. (2) Mobilize women to participate in various political activities. In party rectification, mobilize women to participate, cultivate and develop female party members; publicize the Party's various propositions on women, such as land ownership, property inheritance rights, freedom of marriage, and democratic freedom to participate in social activities. Ensure the establishment of women's committee members in the re-elected and newly established branch committees.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 3rd. In the Jin-Sui liberated areas, the feudal land system has been eliminated and land reform has been completed in most areas. In order to determine land rights and develop agricultural production as soon as possible, the Jin-Sui Border Region Farmers' Association issued a public notice on August 20, stipulating that villages where the majority of the masses have no objection to the distributed land, it should be considered that the land has been well distributed. All efforts should be made to restore and develop production, and land reform should no longer be carried out. County governments and farmers' associations at all levels are instructed to expedite the issuance of land certificates, determine land rights as soon as possible, and protect the land and property of all classes of people in accordance with the law. The Jin-Sui Administrative Office and the Jin-Sui Border Region Farmers' Association also issued a notice on the issuance of land certificates, pointing out that this is the most important thing for developing production after land reform. Governments, representative conferences, and farmers' associations at all levels should widely and deeply publicize the significance of issuing land certificates among villagers, and earnestly and responsibly lead and expedite the issuance. The following points should be noted when issuing land certificates:\n    1. The village government committee should personally lead the work of issuing land certificates and entrust the land distribution committee selected in the past land reform to be responsible for carrying it out. First, review the land distribution situation, allow farmers to raise different opinions on the land distribution situation, and solve them. The land that was not fully distributed locally last year should be distributed in full. Farmers are allowed to voluntarily exchange land for the convenience of cultivation. After reaching a unified opinion on the distribution of land, it should be announced to the villagers, discussed by the masses, and all original and newly distributed old contracts should be taken back and burned in public before issuing new land certificates.\n    2. Before the land certificate is issued, a draft should first be filled out by household, and after carefully proofreading it household by household, it should be officially filled out in regular script with ink. Cursive or simplified characters shall not be used. After filling in, it should be announced at the villagers' meeting in the natural village, and then concentrated by administrative village, and representatives should be sent to the county government for review and stamping.\n    3. For all properties related to land, such as the past practice of farmers to specify \"linked to wood, soil, stone, and water\" on the land deed, it must be clearly noted on the land certificate to prevent disputes.\n    4. After the land certificate is stamped by the county government, a mass meeting of all male and female citizens of the whole village should be held to officially issue it to the head of the household. It should be announced that all men, women, old and young people have the right to own land, and their right to freely operate, buy, sell and lease under specific conditions is recognized. The government guarantees that it will not be violated by anyone. In the future, in the event of land transfer, sale, family division, or marriage, they are allowed to obtain or exchange land certificates from the government.\n    5. Those who are confirmed by public discussion as ne'er-do-wells and are unlikely to be reformed for a while, their land certificates may be kept by the village government committee on their behalf, and issued to them after they have transferred to labor.\n    6. Public land left for veterans or displaced refugees with the consent of the villagers during the land distribution last year, or滩地, alkali land, wasteland, or woodland that could not be distributed for a while due to special reasons, should also be filled out with land certificates, and the sovereignty belongs to the government. The land certificates should be handed over to the village government committee for safekeeping. Those who own land but have not returned due to special reasons (such as those fleeing famine, those fleeing, etc.) must also fill out the certificates, which will be kept by the village government committee on their behalf and handed over to them after they return.\n    7. At the same time as issuing land certificates, it should also be announced that the original and distributed properties of the villagers are protected; landlords and rich peasants who still have a base should be encouraged to invest in agricultural, industrial, and commercial production, and their original and newly established industries and businesses should also be protected.\n    8. Problems and experiences and lessons learned in the process of issuing land certificates must be reported at any time.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥行署、农会通知各级　加紧填发土地证　早日确定地权发展农业生产\n\n1948-09-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥行署、农会通知各级\n  　加紧填发土地证\n  　早日确定地权发展农业生产\n    【新华社晋绥三日电】晋绥解放区的绝大部分地区，封建土地制度业已消灭，土地改革业已完成，晋绥边区农会为及早确定地权，发展农业生产，特于八月廿日颁发布告，规定凡大多数群众对已分土地并无异议的村庄，即认为土地已经分好，全力恢复与发展生产，不再进行土地改革；责成各县县政府和农会，加紧填发土地证，早日确定地权，依法保护各阶层人民所有之土地财物。晋绥行署及晋绥边区农会并同时发出关于填发土地证通知。指出：这是土地改革后发展生产的头等重要事情，各级政府、代表会、农会应在村民中广泛而深入地宣传填发土地证之意义，认真负责领导，迅速填发。在填发土地证时须注意下列几点：\n    一、各村政府委员会应亲自领导填发土地证的工作，并委托过去土地改革中选出的土地分配委员会负责进行。首先审查土地分配情况，允许农民对土地之分配情况提出不同意见，并加以解决。当地去年未分完之土地应一律分完。允许农民间为了耕作便利，自愿兑换土地。在对分配土地取得统一意见后向村民公布，并经过群众讨论，将原有及新分土地旧契约一律收回，当众烧毁，再发给新的土地证。\n    二、土地证填发前，须首先按户填写草底，经过逐户校对清楚后，用墨笔楷字正式填写，不得使用草字、简字。填写后在自然村村民大会上宣布，再以行政村为单位集中，派代表呈请县政府审核盖印。\n    三、凡与土地相关连之财产，如农民过去习惯在地契上写明“木土石水相连”，均须在土地证上批注清楚，以防纠纷。\n    四、土地证由县政府盖印后，开全村男女公民群众大会，正式发给户主。宣布一切男女老少人口均有其土地所有权，承认其自由经营买卖及在特定条件下出租的权利，政府保障其不受任何人侵犯。以后遇有土地转移买卖、分家嫁娶等情形时，准予向政府分领或从新换取土地证。\n    五、经公议确认为二流子，一时难望改好者，其土地证可由村政府委员会代替保存，待其转入劳动后再行发给。\n    六、去年分地时经村民同意为外籍复员军人或移难民留下之公地，或因特别原因一时未能分配之滩地、碱地、荒地、或林木地，亦一律填发土地证，主权归政府，土地证交村政府委员会保存。土地所有者本人因特殊原因外出未归者（如逃荒户、逃亡户等）亦须填发，由村政府委员会代为保管，待其返回后交予本人。\n    七、与发土地证同时，并宣布村民原有及已分得的财物，一律保护；地主富农之尚存有底财者，鼓励其投资农工商业生产，其原有及新营之工商业亦一律加以保护。\n    八、关于在填发土地证中发生之问题及经验教训，须随时报告。"

Some of the groynes at the Zhangxiaotang dangerously engineered section were also damaged, and they have been consolidated after days of repairs. When this dangerously engineered section was repaired last year, the groynes and other structures were mostly built gropingly at night because of the constant shooting by the Kuomintang bandit troops on the south bank, so they were not strong enough.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 渤海区黄河各险工经大力修整均平安\n\n1948-09-06\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　渤海区黄河各险工经大力修整均平安\n    【新华社华东二日电】渤海地区黄河各险工平安。上月中旬黄河第二次上涨时，滨县张肖堂水位达十四点一三公尺，比去年最高水位仅低零点七四公尺。第一次为上月七日，水位与此次相同。沿河最险要的蒲台、利津、滨县、惠民等县险工，因经今年大力修整，均平安无恙。惟利津王家庄险工，因大溜冲刷，挡水的秸扫掉蛰，经张窝等村七百多居民拖石三百多方修堵，已恢复原状。张肖堂险工部分埽坝发生掉蛰，经连日修整，亦趋巩固。该险工去年抢修时，因南岸国民党匪军不断射击，埽坝等多在夜间摸索着做成，因此不够巩固。"

    "content": "Accumulating Fertilizer, Plowing Land, Adjusting Wheat Seeds\n　　Various Regions Intensify Preparations for Wheat Planting\n　　Many Areas in Southern Hebei Actively Reclaim Wasteland and Hasten Wheat Planting\n　　[Jinan Telegraph] Many areas in southern Hebei are reclaiming wasteland in preparation for wheat planting. The Fifth Special Prefecture held a meeting of Hengshui and Ji counties to discuss reclaiming the thousands of acres of wasteland bordering the two counties. After discussion, the conference resolved: (1) Establish four wasteland reclamation stations, each with dedicated personnel responsible for immediately organizing labor to plow the land with tractors in preparation for wheat planting. (2) Rationally allocate draft cattle and loan grain to solve the problem of insufficient animal power. Hengshui will be loaned 40 draft cattle, and Ji County will be loaned 60 draft cattle; each head is calculated at 1,500 jin of rice, totaling 150,000 jin of loan grain. An additional 50,000 jin of loan grain will be allocated separately by the Special Prefecture. The government should provide appropriate care for disaster victims newly returned from the Jiang-occupied areas or returning home from the Northeast who are willing to reclaim wasteland. To ensure the smooth completion of wasteland reclamation, cadres with experience and skills in wasteland reclamation will be assigned to work with the reclamation stations to promptly inspect, research, and promote the work.\n　　[Another Telegraph] Some villages in Guangping, Chengci, and Qiu counties are actively reclaiming wasteland in response to the call for reducing burdens on wasteland reclamation and are preparing to plant wheat. After Guangping arranged wasteland reclamation, each district achieved great results in the first half of August (half a month). In Nanhancun, the Second District, 23 teams of livestock plowed wasteland every day, 52 militia members each took responsibility for one mu, and 47 semi-able-bodied laborers gathered thatch. 1.4 hectares of wasteland have now been reclaimed. Dongchubao has a total of 73 mu of wasteland and has organized 15 teams of livestock and 70 militia members to jointly reclaim the land. On the third day of the seventh lunar month, Beixiabao organized ten teams of livestock to plow wasteland. Village cadres specifically assigned tasks to supervise and inspect, and in less than three days, 65.3 mu of wasteland were reclaimed. Nanwangfeng, Zhangtun, Yantun, and other villages have all reclaimed their wasteland. A total of more than 30 villages have reclaimed 2.65 hectares of wasteland. The First District had a total of 25.58 hectares of wasteland, of which 19.27 hectares have now been reclaimed. The Third District originally had 1.52 hectares of wasteland, which has now been completely reclaimed. Statistics show that there are still 8.61 hectares of wasteland in the whole county, which is estimated to be completely reclaimed in five days. Beisanhucun in the Second District of Chengci and Hecun and Dongliucun in the Third District have all started wasteland reclamation, and some are preparing to plant wheat after reclamation. In Qifangcun, the Second District of Qiu County, the masses benefited greatly from wasteland reclamation last year. Li Chuncheng, Sui Mingli, and Sui Jialu group prepared wasteland early this year to prepare for wheat planting, and each mutual aid group is planning to reclaim all the wasteland in the village.\n　　Xin District of Pingyao Organizes Wasteland Reclamation\n　　[Taiyue Telegraph] The Pingyao Democratic Government is actively organizing the masses in the new district to eliminate wasteland in preparation for wheat planting. In the newly liberated area of Pingyao, due to the past rule of Yan bandit's conscription, grain grabbing, and combined military-agricultural tyranny, there is a lot of wasteland throughout the county. According to statistics from the Third District, there are more than 20,000 mu, accounting for one-sixth of the district's land. Some villages are even more barren. For example, Beiwanggou village has 1,547 mu of wasteland, accounting for one-quarter of the village's land, and even the yards in front of the houses are barren and no one is planting them. However, Yan bandit continued to demand grain and money, forcing some people to be unable to survive, and many people had to flee to other places and wander around. Forty-one households fled Beiwanggou village, accounting for one-sixth of the village's population. After this liberation, after the democratic government thoroughly publicized various policies, everyone was overjoyed and actively produced to catch up with planting buckwheat and other late autumn crops. According to statistics from the Third District, more than 3,000 mu of late autumn crops have been planted. The Third District Office is actively organizing the masses to eliminate wasteland and rush to plant wheat.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 积肥、犁地、调剂麦种　各地加紧准备种麦\n\n1948-09-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　积肥、犁地、调剂麦种\n  　各地加紧准备种麦\n  　冀南不少地区积极灭荒赶种麦\n    【冀南电】冀南不少地区正在开垦荒地准备种麦。五专署为开垦冀、衡交界的千顷荒，召开了冀衡两县垦荒会议。经大会讨论后，最后决议：（一）建立四处开荒站，各站均设专人负责，马上组织力量，以拖拉机翻土，准备种麦。（二）合理分配耕牛贷粮，解决畜力困难。计衡水贷耕牛四十头，冀县贷耕牛六十头；每头按一千五百市斤米计算，共合贷粮十五万斤。另外五万斤贷粮，由专署负责另行分配。对新由蒋占区归来或由东北回家愿开荒的灾民，政府应予适当照顾。为顺利完成开荒工作，还抽出对开荒有经验和有技术的干部，配合各开荒站及时检查研究推动开荒工作。\n    【又电】广平、成磁、邱县一些村庄，在开荒减免负担的号召下，积极开荒，准备种麦。广平布置了开荒后，半个月（八月上半月）各区开荒都有很大成绩。二区南韩村，每天有二十三犋牲口犁荒地，五十二个自卫队员，每人分了一亩，还有四十七个半劳力拾茅草。现下已开荒地一顷四十亩。东处堡共有荒地七十三亩，组织了十五犋牲口，七十个自卫队员下地伙开荒。北下堡旧历七月初三，组织了十犋牲口下地开荒，村干具体分工督促检查，不到三天功夫开荒六十五亩三分。南王封、张屯、烟屯等村都已将荒地开完。共计三十多村开荒二顷六十五亩。一区共荒地二十五顷五十八亩，现已开起来十九顷二十七亩。三区原有荒地一顷五十二亩，现已开完。统计全县还有荒地八顷六十一亩，估计五天以后就可全部开完。成磁二区北散湖村，三区河町村、东流村等都已进行开荒，有的开完后正准备种麦。邱县二区七方村群众，因去年开荒沾光很大，李春成、睢明礼、睢家禄组今年早早就整好了荒地，准备种麦，各个互助组正计划把全村荒地都开出来。\n    平遥新区组织灭荒\n    【太岳电】平遥民主政府积极组织新区群众消灭荒地，准备种麦。平遥新解放区，由于过去受阎匪的抽丁、抢粮、及兵农合一暴政的统治，全县荒芜土地很多，据三区统计：即有两万余亩，占全区土地六分之一。有个别村荒得更多。如北汪沟一村，就荒了一千五百四十七亩，占全村土地四分之一，连门前园地也荒的没人种。但阎匪又继续要粮要款，逼得有些人更无法活下去，许多群众只得流落他乡，四下逃亡。北汪沟村逃荒四十一户，占全村户口六分之一。这次解放后，经民主政府深入宣传各种政策后，大家欢欣若狂，积极生产赶种荞麦等晚秋。据三区统计，已种晚秋三千余亩。三区区公所正积极组织群众，消灭荒地赶种麦子。"

It was also decided to strengthen the Party's leadership and political work in the logistics departments.\n\nThe meeting was personally presided over by Commander He Long. In his summary of the meeting, he pointed out that the logistics work, under the difficult conditions of internal operations, disaster and famine, continuous expansion of the troops, and increasingly heavy supply tasks, has basically completed the task of supporting the front.\n\nThe shortcomings are that unified leadership has not been well implemented, the organizational strength has not been fully utilized, and therefore, the work steps are not coordinated enough, the spirit of adhering to various work systems is not enough, and there is a lack of timely in-depth inspection and supervision; there is a lack of planning and organization in the work, a lack of overall planning, and separate planning for urgency and importance in supply; ideological leadership is relatively weak, and there is a lack of serious criticism and education for the shortcomings of localism and underestimation of logistics work existing in the thinking of some cadres. There has been no active strengthening and improvement of the political understanding of cadres to further promote and improve logistics work.\n\nCommander He pointed out that the Logistics Department of the Joint Defense Military Region is the command post for logistics work in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-JinSui.

They used blood, sweat, and wisdom to defeat the enemy.\n\n(1) Before the wheat harvest, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits swept through Shibeiji Village in Jinxiang County, capturing the family of Village Chief Li Jixie. They subjected them to severe torture, demanding to know where the village cadres had gone and where the grain was hidden. She only cursed them vehemently. The bandit soldiers cut open her mouth with a knife, but she remained heroically unyielding. She did not say a word about the public grain. The bandit soldiers then subjected her to electric shock. After she passed out and regained consciousness, the evil bandit soldiers cut off her two nipples, but she still did not utter a word. The bandit soldiers left the half-dead Village Chief Li's family in the square. Then, they captured the family of clerk Zeng Guangtai. The bandit soldiers first showed her the condition of the village chief's family and asked her who the village cadres were. She was as resolute as the village chief's family. Her entire body was beaten to a pulp, but she still did not say a word. The bandit soldiers then captured a child and cut off all of its hands and feet with a knife! The child did not reveal a single grain of public grain. The bandit soldiers returned to interrogate Village Chief Li's family, but still could not get a single word out of them. The bandit soldiers then executed her and the child. Next, the bandit soldiers turned to the clerk's family: \"You are truly a Communist devotee!\" The clerk's family cursed loudly, \"You cowardly troops, I am a Communist devotee. I will tell my child to join the Communist army when he grows up! Beat to death you cowardly troops!\" The bandit soldiers then executed her. Then, they captured people to interrogate, and beat thirteen people to death (including four women). The bandit soldiers never got the grain or the village cadres. They only saw the people's heroism and sacrifice!\n\n(2) The women's association chairperson of Xin Yangmiao in Caoliu District, Danxian County, after being captured by the bandit soldiers, frankly admitted that she was the women's association chairperson, but said nothing about other matters. The bandit soldiers asked her, \"Why did you become the chairperson?\"\n\n\"To liberate ourselves!\"\n\n\"What else?\" the bandit soldiers asked again.\n\n\"To avoid oppression!\"\n\nAfter beating her for a day, the bandit soldiers asked again, \"Do you still want to liberate yourselves?\"\n\nShe gritted her teeth and said, \"Liberate! Liberate!!\"\n\nThe bandit soldiers, in order to make her betray other cadres, pushed her into a pit and threatened to bury her alive, but she did not betray a single person. The enemy was helpless in the face of her righteousness.\n\n(3) A women's federation member in Ximatai Village, Danxian County, allowed her house to be deliberately collapsed to cover the entrance of a cellar, sheltering the shells and machine guns stored there. The bandit soldiers beat her to the point of death twice, but she never confessed. The materials were not lost.\n\n(4) In supporting the front and production, the men went to the front lines, and the women did all the work in the rear. They never lagged behind in anything. For example, last autumn, thirty young women in Xulukou Village, Huangdui District, Danxian County, harvested all the soybeans in the village on time. The old ladies all said, \"If it weren't for these sisters-in-law, the crops would have been left in the fields.\" Women in Caoma District and Ximalou Village did all the work of grinding rice, carrying bags, and loading vehicles during the Longhai Campaign last autumn. After loading the vehicles, they sent old men to deliver them. Some women even led the way for our army at night.

    "date": "1948-09-06",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Frost Prevention Methods\n    [Taihang Telegram] The Limit of Heat has passed, and White Dew is approaching. Crops will soon be ripe. In the past, counties like Heshun and Xiyang in the Taihang Second District often suffered from frost disasters in autumn, leading to reduced harvests. Considering the early cold this year, in order to protect the autumn crops and avoid the damage of frost disasters, the local Xinhua News here introduces the following frost prevention methods: The first step in prevention is to be able to observe the conditions under which frost is most likely to occur, so as to be able to prevent it effectively. Generally speaking, if the sky is clear blue during the day, it will definitely frost at night. If the sky has some bluish-gray color, it will also frost at night. If the sky is more gray than blue (gray-blue), the possibility of frost is smaller. If the sky is entirely gray, there will definitely be no frost at night, because if the day is clear blue with no clouds at all, it is as if a quilt has been removed from the ground, and the climate will be particularly cold at night, making it easy to frost. The specific methods to overcome frost disasters are: (1) Smudging: Burn firewood in small piles in the fields, the more widespread the burning, the better, and the more smoke, the better. Be careful not to make the piles too large, causing flames. If there are flames, the smoke should be reduced. This method has been used in some places with great success. Because crops are generally most afraid of sudden cold during growth, if the ground is smudged with smoke, the layer of smoke can reduce heat dissipation, so that the air temperature will not drop quickly, and the crops will not be harmed in this less cold air. For burning, you can use ordinary dry firewood, such as cypress branches. Where firewood is scarce, it can be combined with late autumn fertilizer application, and the ashes can also be used as fertilizer. (2) Set up bonfire platforms. In the wild, especially in areas prone to frost, set up several bonfire platforms, each with five or six bundles of firewood. Establish necessary frost prevention organizations, adopt village-to-village joint prevention methods, and stipulate certain signals, such as setting off firecrackers or lighting fires, dispatching frost prevention watchmen. If it is discovered that frost is about to fall or has already begun to fall, quickly light the fires or set off firecrackers, and light fires everywhere at the same time, which can overcome frost disasters and save the autumn grain that is about to be harvested. Last year, Heshun, Xiyang and other counties used these methods to save tens of thousands of acres of autumn crops, with great results.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 防霜办法\n\n1948-09-06\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　防霜办法\n    【太行电】处暑已过，白露来临庄稼就要成熟，太行二分区和顺、昔阳等县过去每年秋天常常受到霜灾的危害以致收成减少，加以今年早寒，为保护秋禾，避免霜灾的损害，此间新华报特介绍防霜办法如下：预防办法首先要会观察在什么情况下最容易下霜，才好预防。一般的说，如果白天是青天一色，夜间必定下霜。如天空带些青灰色，夜里也会下霜，天突灰色重青色轻（灰青色）下霜的可能就小了，要是天空全是灰色，夜间决不会有霜，因为白天是青天一色，没有一点云彩，就如同地上去了一层被子一样，到夜间气候就会特别冷，容易下霜。战胜霜灾的具体办法是：（一）薰烟法：用柴火在地里分成很多小堆焚烧，烧的柴堆越普遍越好，冒烟越多越好。注意不要使柴堆大了，冒起火头，一有火头烟就要减少。这种办法有些地方已经用过，收效很大。因为一般庄稼在生长时候最怕突然转冷，如果地里用烟薰薰，地面盖一层烟，能减少热力的发散，使气温不会很快的降低，庄稼也就在这不大冷的空气中，不会受害了。烧火用的柴，可用一般的干柴，如柏枝等。缺柴的地方可与晚秋薰肥结合，烧后还可顶肥料用。（二）设焚火台。在野外，尤其是容易降霜的地区，设立若干焚火台，每台可准备柴火五六担，设必要的防霜组织，采用村与村的联防办法，并规定一定的记号，如响炮点火等，派遣防霜了望哨，发现快要落霜或已开始降落，就赶快点火或响炮，四处一齐点火，即可战胜霜灾，挽救快要吃到嘴边的秋粮禾。去年和顺昔阳等县用这些办法，救秋禾数万亩，收效极大。"

    "content": "Enforced Orders Followed by Neglect\n  　Production Losses in the Eighth District of Anguo\n    [Jizhong Electric] Cadres in the Eighth District of Anguo seriously neglected production leadership, causing the district's production to fall into a state of drift. In half a year, the district committee held only two production meetings, and the second meeting was not even conveyed to the villages. District cadres regarded production work as \"incidental\" and \"supplementary,\" rarely going to the countryside to lead production work. Around February of the lunar calendar, Wang Shu, the district head, and two others held a meeting of party members and cadres in Xu Xin Village. Under the influence of a one-sided view of poverty at the time, they promoted and mobilized the masses for production, saying: \"Organizing into mutual aid teams requires mutual assistance for a year; no one is allowed to quit halfway. Party members and cadres must be filial sons to poor peasants, and branch secretaries must play an exemplary role; those with labor power should help those without.\" At the time, Branch Secretary Wang Yongqing said, \"I will help Ren Luoguo, a poor peasant.\" The village head said, \"I will do farm work for Ren Zhuyun, a military family member.\" Others also volunteered to \"help poor peasants.\" However, District Head Wang forced everyone to organize on the spot, saying, \"No one can leave until they are organized.\" Under these circumstances, the masses reluctantly formed groups. District Head Wang also said, \"Party members and cadres must launch a manure-cart campaign, with each person delivering a cart of manure to poor peasants.\" At the time, all party members and cadres echoed the call. After District Head Wang left, the so-called \"mutual aid teams\" and \"manure-cart campaign\" fell through. The branch secretary said, \"I can't even finish my own family's work, how can I help poor peasants?\" District cadre Jia Feixiang also sat in Nanwangmai Village urging \"organization,\" but did not check up on it afterward. It was not until the sub-district work team inspected that they discovered not a single mutual aid team existed; some had been organized for only half a day before collapsing. This is the bad result of enforced orders. After issuing enforced orders, they no longer cared, thus forming a drift in production work. For example, some district cadres believed that the masses knew how to produce, while they themselves lacked production knowledge, so leading production was meddling. Wang Hanchen, the district committee secretary, believed that other tasks were very urgent, such as the twelve types of forms and tax collection in July, so there was no time to lead production.\n    Because district cadres relaxed production leadership, many village branches also paid little attention to leading production. Many village organizations were unsound (only recently rectified), coupled with disunity between new and old cadres and low morale, which prevented the party's policies from being well implemented. The county committee's production meeting for village cadres in June was not discussed in Nanwangmai and six other villages. Therefore, the masses knew little about the party's production policies and the seven measures of the Jizhong Administrative Office for rewarding the development of production. After the North Xu Xin Village branch returned from the county meeting, they only told the branch and villagers' meeting, \"Do not waste an inch of land, everyone organize to implement work-point clearing...\" At the same time, they found someone who liked to eat, drink, and be lazy to lead production. As a result, the village was only lively for a while during the \"blitz\" of wasteland reclamation, and then it collapsed. Other village branches rarely led production. Village cadres generally held the erroneous idea that \"other work must be done, but it doesn't matter if production isn't led.\" Due to the relaxation of production leadership by district and village cadres, production in the district was in a state of serious drift. The organization of production mutual aid was not carried out well at all. Because agricultural loan work was not checked in a timely manner, many loan recipients had the idea of borrowing without repaying. Most of the water conservancy loans were not used for production. Three villages, including Zheng Village, borrowed funds for twenty-one waterwheels, but actually only bought six, and the rest of the funds were used for other things. Because the party's policy of developing production was not widely and deeply publicized, the masses still had many ideological concerns. Some poor peasants were not active enough in production, and middle peasants still had many concerns about getting rich.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    Editor's note: The abandonment of production leadership in the Eighth District of Anguo, and some seriously enforced ordering methods that violated the principles of organizing production, not only alienated the masses but also caused great losses to the development of the great production movement. The district's self-criticism is also extremely superficial, and the problem has not been thoroughly solved ideologically. The Anguo County Committee and County Government, regarding the serious phenomenon of abandoning production leadership in the Eighth District, I wonder if they have conducted inspections? Why has this erroneous phenomenon continued for so long without being corrected? The Anguo County Committee should promptly conduct on-the-spot inspections, strengthen leadership, rectify policies, and educate village cadres and party members to reform their work style and unite the masses for production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 先强迫命令后放任自流　安国八区生产受损失\n\n1948-09-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　先强迫命令后放任自流\n  　安国八区生产受损失\n    【冀中电】安国八区干部，严重忽视生产领导，使该区生产陷于自流。半年来，区委只召开过两次生产会议，第二次还没传达到村。区干部把生产工作当作“附带”和“配备”工作，很少为领导生产工作下过乡。阴历二月间，该区区长王署等三人在徐辛庄召开党员、干部会议，在当时片面的贫困观点支配之下，宣传动员群众生产时说：“组织起来要互助一年，不许半路没了事，党员、干部要给贫雇农当孝子，支部书记要起模范作用，有人的要和没人的互助。”当场支书王永清说：“我和贫农任罗锅互助。”村长说：“我给军属任助云做地里活。”别人也自认“给贫农互助。”但王区长当场强制大家组织起来，并说：“谁组织不起来不能走。”在此种情况下，群众便勉强的结合了组。王区长又说：“党员、干部要开展一车粪运动，每人给贫雇农送一车粪。”当时全体党员、干部也都随声响应了。王区长走后，所谓“互助组”、“一车粪运动”也就流产了。支书说：“家里活还做不过来，怎么为贫雇农哩？”区干部贾飞祥也在南王买村坐催着“组织起来”，但以后也没检查过。直到分区工作组检查时，才发现一个互助组也没有，有的只组织了半天就垮了台。这是强迫命令造成的恶果。他们强迫命令之后，便再也不管了，因而又形成生产工作的自流，如有的区干部认为群众会生产，咱们缺乏生产知识，领导生产是多管。区委书记王汉臣认为别的工作一来都是很紧的，如七月里十二种表格、征收等等任务一大堆，那有时间领导生产呢？\n    因为区干部放松了生产领导，所以好多村支部在领导生产上也不注意。不少的村组织不健全（最近才整顿），加之新老干部不团结，工作情绪不高，致使党的政策不能很好贯彻下去。县委六月间召开的各村干部生产会议，南王买等七村根本没开会研讨。因此党的生产政策和冀中行署奖励发展生产的七项办法，群众很少知道。北徐辛庄支部从县开会回去后，只在支部、村民大会说了说“不要荒废一寸土地，大伙组织起来实行记工清工………”，同时找了一个好吃喝懒做活的来领导生产。结果，该村除了“突击”荒地时热闹了一阵，以后就垮台了。别的村支部则很少领导生产。各村干部普遍存在着“别的工作不作不行，生产不领导不要紧”的错误思想。由于区、村干部放松生产领导，使该区生产形成严重的自流。对生产互助根本未很好进行组织。农贷工作因未及时检查，好多贷款户存在着借了不还的思想；水利贷款大部没用到生产中去。郑庄等三村，贷了二十一辆水车的款，实际上只买了六辆，其余的款就干了旁的。由于没广泛深入宣传我党发展生产的政策，所以群众还存在着不少的思想顾虑，部分贫农生产也不够积极，中农对发家致富仍有好多顾虑。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    编者按：安国八区放弃生产领导，和某些违犯组织生产原则的严重强迫命令方式，这不仅脱离了群众，而且对开展大生产运动造成了很大损失。该区检讨亦极浅薄，未从思想上彻底解决问题。安国县委、县府对八区此种放弃生产领导的严重现象，不知是否做过检查？为何使这种错误现象继续很久，而未得纠正？安国县委应迅速进行实地检查，加强领导，端正政策，并教育村干、党员改造作风，团结群众进行生产。"

In Jinghai County, the Ziya River breached its banks in July, inundating 136 villages and 8,800 hectares of land. More than 95,000 people suffered from the flood, and 60,000 people are unable to maintain their lives. The county party committee specifically instructed all cadres in the disaster area to vigorously mobilize and help the victims collect wild vegetables, gather grass seeds, and dig groundnuts to save the disaster through thrift. More than 4,000 disaster victims were organized to dig groundnuts in Wen'an. Cadres were also responsible for taking the lead and contacting local village cadres to properly resettle the victims. This year, the groundnuts in the low-lying areas of Wen'an are large and plentiful, and each person can dig seven large sheng a day, and some can dig a dou a day. On average, each person digs half a dou a day, which can produce nine jin of flour. Each dou can be sold for 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, which can be exchanged for at least half a dou of grain. In Qizhuang and Dazhangzhuang villages in the Second District, 80% of the households rely on digging groundnuts for food. After 49 villages in Suning were flooded, the district held a joint meeting of district and village cadres, calling on all men, women, and children in the villages to mobilize and engage in transportation and sales, develop the textile industry, collect more wild vegetables and leaves, and carry out a movement to save the disaster through thrift. In Dawang Village, Renhe, out of 140 households, more than 50 are collecting wild vegetables. Now each household has collected three to four hundred jin. Cadres and teachers in various places are also carrying out a movement to save the disaster through thrift. Teachers at Anping Primary School are actively donating rice. As of August 18, teachers throughout the county had donated 3,410 jin of rice. In Wuqi County, district cadres decided to save one or two liang of rice a day starting in August to help the victims. Now cadres throughout the county have saved 690 jin of rice, all of which has been given to the victims.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中各水灾区干部群众　组织生产节约备荒\n\n1948-09-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中各水灾区干部群众\n  　组织生产节约备荒\n    【冀中电】冀中各灾区干部、群众开展节约救灾运动。静海县，子牙河于七月间决口，被淹一百三十六个村，淹地八千八百多顷。九万五千多人遭受水灾，现有六万人没法维持生活。该县县委特指示灾区全体干部，大力发动和帮助灾民采野菜、弄草子、挖地梨节约救灾。并组织了四千多灾民，到文安去挖地梨。并有干部负责带头和当地区村干部接洽，适当安置灾民。今年文安洼地梨又大又多，每人一天能挖七大升，多的一天能挖一大斗。平均每人一天挖半大斗；能出九斤面。每斗可卖四、五千元，最少可换半斗粮食。二区齐庄、大章庄等村十分之八的户依靠挖地梨吃饭。肃宁四十九个村被水淹以后，区里开了区村干部联席会，号召各村男女老少动员起来搞运销，开展纺织业，多采野菜和树叶，开展节约救灾运动。任河大汪村，一百四十户，有五十多家采野菜的。现在各户都采了三、四百斤。各地干部、教员也开展节约救灾运动。安平小学教员都踊跃献米。截止八月十八日，全县教师已献米三千四百一十斤。无极县区干部为救济灾民，决定从八月份开始一天节米一两。现在全县干部已节米六百九十斤，全部给了灾民。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 31st - The Seventh Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army gave a typical report on improving living standards and methods of thrift at the National Supply Training Class. All comrades engaged in administrative work unanimously agreed that the Seventh Company is a good example for the whole country. Its main characteristic is that the comrades in the kitchen can consciously and proactively think of ways to save money and improve the company's life within the supply standards. The Seventh Company first convened a meeting of kitchen cadres, party members, and activists to explain that Shandong was experiencing food difficulties due to looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, especially in areas that had undergone combat, where many ordinary people were eating wild herbs and tree leaves. Therefore, improving living standards should not exceed the system's requirements, and waste should be opposed in order to save food for disaster relief. Then, all the comrades in the company were mobilized to ensure that not a single grain of rice was lost and not a single extra blade of grass was burned.\n\n　　After the meeting, the kitchen precisely calculated how much firewood was needed to cook a meal and boil a pot of water, and split the firewood and sorghum stalks to burn in order to save fuel. When the platoons needed grass to boil water for ironing clothes, the kitchen feared waste and personally burned the water for them, or used the water from steaming steamed buns to iron clothes. The kitchen comrades also personally delivered boiling water and lamp oil to the platoons to avoid waste. Therefore, the entire company was supposed to receive 455 catties of grass per day, but actually burned only 250 catties, saving 205 catties.\n\n　　In the past, the leftover cold rice from the kitchen was distributed to the platoons. If the platoons didn't eat it, they would give the cold rice to the ordinary people and still go to the kitchen to ask for newly cooked food. After the kitchen found out, they kept the cold rice for themselves to eat. When the platoons saw that the kitchen often ate cold rice, everyone also scrambled to eat it and no longer gave it to the ordinary people privately, and the unity with the kitchen became closer. The kitchen also turned over the flour sacks after emptying them and swept them once, with each sack yielding two taels, saving a lot.\n\n　　Many people were not used to eating pancakes made from sorghum flour, which resulted in waste. The kitchen then studied cutting the pancakes into small pieces and stewing them, or making noodles. The supply sergeant consulted with the kitchen when buying vegetables, asking about the platoons' reactions and which vegetables they liked to eat, and regularly sought the opinions of the economic committee member. The accounts were summarized every ten days and fully summarized every month, announced to the entire company, and pointed out any waste and savings during this period, so that the administration could mobilize everyone to correct them in time.\n\n　　For the sick, the kitchen and the administration platoon leader personally delivered food and kindly asked them what they wanted to eat, doing their best to meet their needs. After one liberated comrade recovered from his illness, he automatically helped the kitchen carry water. He held the administration platoon leader's hand and said, \"I owe my recovery to you. If I were in the Kuomintang, I would have died long ago.\"\n\n　　After the Changwei Campaign, the kitchen secretly ironed and washed the soldiers' clothes and put forward the slogan: \"No need for the platoons to carry grass or grain, so everyone can rest well and train.\"\n\n　　In order to encourage the kitchen comrades, the administration platoon leader drew thirty-one towers, called the upgrade tower, to record each person's achievements, and everyone competed to see who could reach the top of the tower first.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东解放军某团七连　实行节约改善生活\n\n1948-09-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华东解放军某团七连\n  　实行节约改善生活\n    【新华社华东前线三十一日电】解放军某团七连，在全国供给训练班中作了关于改善生活与节约方法的典型报告，全体作事务工作的同志，一致认为七连是全国的好榜样。其主要特点是伙房同志能自觉和自动的积极想法节约，在供给标准内改善连队生活。七连首先召开了伙房干部、党员、积极分子会议，说明山东因受蒋匪抢劫造成粮食的困难，特别是经过战斗的地区，不少老百姓吃的是苦菜、树叶，因此改善生活不要超过制度以外，反对浪费，实行节约，省下粮食救济灾民。接着动员了全连同志，保证不丢一粒米，不多烧一根草。\n    伙房经过会议后，精密的计算了做一次饭烧一锅水要用多少柴，并把木柴、高粱秸劈开着烧，以求节省。排里要草烧水烫衣服，伙房怕浪费，亲自代烧，或者利用蒸馒头水烫衣服。伙房同志又亲往排里送开水，送灯油，以免浪费。因此全连每日应领草四百五十五斤，而实烧仅二百五十斤，节约了二百零五斤。\n    过去伙房剩的冷饭都分到排里，排里不吃，把冷饭送给老百姓，仍到伙房要新煮的吃，伙房知道了以后，就把冷饭留着自己吃，排里见伙房常吃冷饭，大家也就争着吃，再不私自给老百姓了，与伙房的团结也更密切起来。伙房并将装白面的干粮袋倒出后，翻过来扫一遍，一条能扫出二两，节省很多。\n    高粱面子做的饼很多人吃不惯，因此产生了浪费现象，伙房就研究把饼切成小块烩着吃，或做面条吃。上士买菜都与伙房研究，排里有那些反映，爱吃那些菜，经常征求经济委员的意见。帐目是十天小结、一月大结，向全连公布，并指出在这一个时期有那些浪费与节约，行政上即时动员大家纠正。\n    对于病号，伙房与管理排长亲自送饭，并亲切的问他们要吃什么尽可能做到，一位解放同志病好了后自动帮伙房挑水，他握着管理排长的手说：“我的病多亏你们，若在国民党那里早就死了。”\n    昌潍战役后，伙房偷着把战士的衣服烫洗了，并提出口号：“不用排里搬草搬粮，叫大家休息好练兵。”\n    管理排长为了鼓励伙房同志，并画了三十一个塔，名为升级塔，来记每个人的成绩，大家比赛谁能先达到最高的塔顶。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, 4th. Party newspapers in the liberated areas of North China are playing an increasingly important role and enjoying a growing reputation in the lives of the masses. In addition to striving to implement the Party's policies and reflect the demands and wishes of the masses in the news they publish, these newspapers have established various columns closely linked to the broad masses, such as \"Voices of the Masses,\" \"Correspondences between Editors and Readers,\" \"Criticisms and Suggestions,\" \"Inquiries and Replies,\" \"Social Services,\" and \"Mailbox.\" The former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Daily, in May of this year alone, received 48 contributions to its dedicated \"Voices of the Masses\" column. In addition, it accepted \"complaints\" from those who came to the newspaper office in person and wrote opinions on behalf of 11 readers. The newspaper office handled these \"voices\" of the masses with great care. Some of the contributions were published, some were excerpted and sent to relevant departments for processing before publication, and some were investigated by reporters. For example, when Wei Dianhua, a farmer from Shahe County in the Taihang District, came to the newspaper office to \"complain,\" the newspaper sent a reporter to Shahe County with an investigation team organized by the Border Region Government to investigate and clear his name. Xu Gengdi, a farmer from Wu'an County in the Taihang District, was falsely accused and detained by the Wu'an County Government. After a reporter from the newspaper discovered this, he exposed it, immediately promoting the rectification of judicial work in Wu'an and arousing the attention of the judicial departments in the Taihang District. As a result, many county judicial sections conducted file reviews and inspections of their work. Shortly after its inception, the North China People's Daily published reports on certain laissez-faire phenomena in production leadership in counties such as Pingshan and Jianping (a newly established county west of Pingshan), enabling various localities to conscientiously implement the North China Central Bureau's policy of uniting in production. In the \"Criticisms and Suggestions\" section of the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily, after it was revealed in June that the production department of the administrative office of the district had seized a cigarette machine belonging to a merchant from Changyuan, the administrative office conducted an inspection, returned the machine to its original owner, and sent a letter to the newspaper office explaining the handling of the matter. In July, after the newspaper revealed that the production team of the Ninth Sub-district of the district had borrowed utensils from villagers in Zhang Niuwu Village and delayed their return, the production team immediately convened a Party meeting to conduct a review of mass discipline and sent cadres to Niuwu Village to apologize. Newspapers in Taihang, Taiyue, Ji-Zhong, Ji-Nan, and Bei-Yue have also strengthened the connection between the masses and the Party and the government through the same work, promoting land reform, supporting the front lines, and production for disaster relief. High-level Party and government leading organs in various localities attach great importance to the criticisms in Party newspapers, advocate criticism, and stipulate that replying to Party newspapers' inquiries on work is the duty of all levels of organs and cadres. Lin Tie, secretary of the Ji-Zhong District Party Committee, pointed out at the district's communications work conference in June: \"We should not be afraid of criticism in movements and work. Only by carrying out criticism and self-criticism can we improve our work better. Therefore, the practice of only allowing reports of advantages and achievements, not allowing reports of shortcomings and errors, and only reporting good news and not reporting bad news in some places is not allowed. On the other hand, we should also pay attention to preventing only finding shortcomings and problems and not making positive and active reports, which is also incorrect.\" The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office recently instructed its subordinates to pay attention to the criticisms of various works published in Party newspapers, believing that this is a powerful weapon for enabling governments and cadres at all levels to accept the supervision of the people and correct bureaucratic work styles. The instruction pointed out: (1) The criticisms and inquiries raised in the newspapers must be examined in a serious manner, with a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people, and in a timely manner. Any phenomenon of refusing to inspect or deliberately delaying should be strictly criticized. If the mistake is persisted in, disciplinary action should be taken. (2) If leading departments and responsible comrades find criticisms of their departments in the newspapers, regardless of where the opinions come from, they should immediately conduct an inspection. There should be no phenomenon of ignoring or shelving, and even less should they shift the blame to subordinates or adopt a bureaucratic attitude. (3) No department should simply examine the matter that has been criticized because of that matter. After clarifying the situation, it should carefully analyze it, and thereby connect it to similar matters, find the problems in leadership, find the key, and solve them thoroughly and comprehensively. However, on the whole, the work of fully developing criticism and self-criticism by Party newspapers in various localities is still far from sufficient, and some local Party committees still have a tendency to dislike criticism. Strengthening the critical work of Party newspapers and establishing closer ties with the masses remains an important task for Party newspapers in North China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北各地党报　与广大群众密切联系开展批评和自我批评\n\n1948-09-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华北各地党报\n  　与广大群众密切联系开展批评和自我批评\n    【新华社华北四日电】华北解放区各地党报在群众生活中的作用和声誉正在日益增高。这些报纸除了在其所登载的新闻中，力求贯彻党的政策、反映群众的要求与愿望之外，都设有与广大群众密切联系的各种专栏，如“群众呼声”、“编读往来”、“批评与建议”、“询问与答复”、“社会服务”、“信箱”等。前晋冀鲁豫人民日报，仅今年五月一个月，即在其专设的“群众呼声”栏内，收到来稿四十八件，此外还接受亲来报馆者的“告状”，并为十一位读者代书意见。对于群众的这些“呼声”，报馆都慎重予以处理，有的把来稿披露，有的把来稿先摘述要点，寄交有关部门处理，然后披露，有的派记者前往调查。如太行区沙河县农民魏殿花来报馆“告状”，报馆即派记者协同边区政府组织调查团赴沙河县调查，为之洗清冤苦；太行区武安县农妇徐更的被人诬陷，扣押于武安县政府，报馆记者发现后，予以揭露，立即促进武安司法工作的整顿，并引起太行区司法部门的重视，许多县司法科都因而进行清理档案，检查工作。华北人民日报创刊后不久，即揭载了平山、建屏（新设县，在平山以西）等县领导生产中的某些自流现象，使各地认真贯彻执行华北中央局团结生产的方针。冀鲁豫日报“批评与建议”之内，六月揭露该区行署生产部门侵占长垣商人卷烟机后，行署即进行检查，把机器退还原主，并致函报馆说明处理经过。七月该报揭露该区九分区生产股借用了张牛吴村村民用具，拖延不还后，该生产股立即召开党内会议，进行群众纪律检查，并派干部至牛吴村道歉。太行、太岳、冀中、冀南、北岳等地报纸，也都以同样的工作加强了群众和党和政府的联系，推动了土地改革、支援前线、生产救灾等工作。各地高级党政领导机关都很重视党报的批评，都会提倡批评，并规定答复党报对工作的质询为各级机关与干部的义务。冀中区党委书记林铁在六月该区通讯工作会议上指出：“在运动中和工作中我们应该不怕批评，只有开展批评和自我批评，工作才会更好的改进。因此有些地方只许报导优点成绩，不许报导缺点错误，只报喜不报忧的作风，是不准许的。另一方面，也应注意防止只找缺点毛病，不做正面的积极的报导，这也是不对的。”冀鲁豫行署于日前指令所属重视党报刊载的对各种工作的批评文字，认为这是使各级政府与干部很好的接受人民大众的监督，纠正官僚主义作风的有力武器。指示指出：（一）报纸上所提出的批评与询问，必需以严肃的态度，本高度为人民服务的热情，及时检查。任何拒绝检查或故意拖延的现象，都应受到严格的批评。如果坚持错误则更要受到纪律的处分。（二）各个领导部门和负责同志，如果在报纸上发现对本部门作的批评时，不问其意见来自何处，应该马上进行检查，绝不许有忽视与搁置现象，更不能诿过下级，不能采取官僚主义态度。（三）任何部门不应该因为那件事情遭受了批评，就单纯检查那件事情，应于弄清情况之后，仔细的进行分析，并从而联系到类似的事情，找出领导的毛病，找出关键，予以彻底全面的解决。但是整个地说来，各地党报对于充分开展批评和自我批评的工作，做得还很不够，某些地方党委也还存在着不喜欢批评的倾向。加强党报的批评工作和更密切地联系群众，仍然是华北党报的重要任务。"

    "content": "[Jizhong Electric] Dongsigong Village in the Eighth District of Gaocheng County, a flood-affected village, has broken away from the simple reliance on relief and is organizing the masses for production and self-salvation through various means. The village has a total of 454 households with 2,253 people. It has 6,451.7 mu of land, of which 5,377.2 mu were flooded, including 4,252.1 mu buried in sand. There are still 275 mu of land underwater. Additionally, 142 wells were damaged and 34 houses collapsed. After the floodwaters receded, when the village began to organize production for disaster relief, the district cadres held an attitude of bestowing favors and did not send anyone to the village to investigate and understand the situation. They only sent a message to the village, asking the village to register how much buckwheat would be planted, so that the cooperative could lend them seeds. As a result, 215 households were counting on borrowing seeds. However, the seeds were never lent out, and the district did not send anyone to explain, which resulted in dissatisfaction among the masses, and buckwheat was not planted. On August 16th, district cadres went to the village to organize the masses for production and self-salvation. They learned that the cadres had a strong mentality of simply relying on disaster relief. The district cadres first convened a joint meeting of the branch committee and group leaders to educate them, explaining that Party members and cadres leading the masses to overcome the famine through production was \"disaster relief\" work, and they should find ways to mobilize the masses for production and self-salvation. They also discussed how the branch committee and group leaders should divide their work, investigate and register disaster-stricken households, how to organize carts for transportation, and mobilize weaving households to organize and carry out textile production. After the meeting, they held a general meeting of all village cadres and elected a production and disaster relief committee. They also separately convened meetings of weaving households and cart-owning households to implement the education of production for self-salvation, putting forward slogans such as \"Relieving you for one day won't solve the hunger of a thousand days\" and \"If you want to eat, find work to do.\" They also organized through core members. Based on the village's production foundation, the district cadres found various avenues for the masses to produce. The village originally had 227 livestock, but after the flood, 90 were sold due to lack of work and fodder. If transportation is not organized, the number of livestock will continue to decrease. The cooperative has established a coal yard on the north bank of the Pangtuo River to supply transportation to disaster-stricken villages in Hebei. Currently, Dongsigong Village has 32 voluntarily formed cart teams with 56 livestock, preparing to engage in transportation and sales. The village has 110 looms, of which 61 are currently in operation. The rest are not operating due to lack of capital and low profits from weaving (each bolt of cloth can only earn 1,000 to 3,000 yuan). However, the masses in the village have high confidence in textile production as a means of fighting disaster, with the saying: \"Don't be afraid of a lean year, just be afraid that textile production won't make money.\" They are asking the government to find ways to solve the sales problem. The county cooperative and district cadres are actively trying to solve this problem. In addition, the district cadres are also planning to introduce some surplus young and middle-aged laborers to work at the station and coal yard, in order to overcome the famine through various means.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 打破依赖赈济思想多方组织生产自救\n\n1948-09-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　打破依赖赈济思想多方组织生产自救\n    【冀中电】藁城八区水灾村东四公，打破单纯依赖赈济思想，从多方设法组织群众生产自救。该村共四百五十四户，二千二百五十三人。有地六千四百五十一亩七分，五千三百七十七亩二分被水淹，其中四千二百五十二亩一分淤了沙。现在还有二百七十五亩地有水。还淤坏水井一百四十二眼，塌房三十四间。水撤以后，开始组织该村生产救灾时，因为区干部存在着恩赐观点，又没派人到该村调查了解，只给村里捎了个信，叫村里登记种多少荞麦，好说给推进社贷给种子。结果二百一十五户专指望着贷种。但后来种子也没贷下来，区里也没来人解释，结果遭到群众不满，荞麦也没有种上。八月十六日，区干部到该村组织群众生产自救，了解到干部单纯依赖赈灾的劲头很大，区干部首先召开了支委、小组长联席会，进行教育，说明党员，干部领导群众生产渡荒是“救灾”工作，应想法发动群众生产自救。并讨论了支委和小组长如何分工，调查登记灾户，如何组织大车搞运输，发动织布户组织起来开展纺织等问题。会后，又开了全体村干会选举了生产救灾委员会。并又分头召集织布户、大车户开会，贯彻了生产自救的教育，提出“救你一日饱、解不了千日饥”、“要吃饭找活干”等口号。并通过骨干进行组织。区干部根据该村生产基础，从多方为群众找出生产门路。该村原有牲口二百二十七个，发生水灾后，因没活干和缺少草料，已卖出九十个，如不搞运输，牲口还会减少。推进社便在滂沱河北岸设立了一个煤炭厂，供给河北灾村运输。现在东四公村已自由结伙三十二辆大车，五十六头牲口，准备跑运销。该村有织布机一百一十张，现在正动着的六十一张，其余的因为本钱少，织布利小（每匹布只能赚一千元到三千元）没有活动着。但该村群众对纺织抗灾信心很高，流传着：“不怕过歉年，就怕纺织不赚钱。”要求政府设法解决销路问题。现该县推进社和区干部，正积极设法解决这个问题。另外区干部并计划介绍一些剩余的青壮年劳动力，到车站、煤厂作工，从多方面设法渡荒。"

    "content": "【Jinnan Telegram】Pests in Jinnan have spread from fourteen counties to thirty-one counties. Many crops have been eaten or gnawed to death, causing significant losses to the autumn harvest. Currently, the entire Jinnan region is carrying out a pest control campaign through ideological mobilization and organizational guarantees. At the beginning of the campaign, the masses had thoughts of superstitious belief in fate, fear of harming seedlings while killing insects, pessimism and paralysis, and the idea of \"sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door.\" In response to the above-mentioned thoughts of the masses, cadres in various places used the facts of pest control and harm reduction to carry out propaganda and education among the masses, and led village cadres to take the lead in demonstrating, so as to enhance the masses' confidence in pest control. Then the masses were organized to capture and kill pests collectively or dispersedly, and a pest control campaign was launched everywhere. Two old women in Wulichang Village, En County, did not go to kill insects themselves, but went door-to-door to collect incense paper to pray at the temple. As a result, the insects in other people's fields were gradually reduced by killing, while the crops in their fields were almost eaten by insects because they were not killed. This fact not only educated her, but also educated the masses. Crickets were rampant in the first district of Pingxiang, and these insects came out at night to eat crops and hid during the day. Many people believed that this insect was not as easy to kill as grasshoppers, and expressed a lack of confidence. Some were even afraid of trampling on crops and deliberately emphasized that they could not be killed. After the district cadres led the village cadres and activists to kill the insects in a field, the masses' thinking was cleared. Then, the masses in each village actively started fighting. Locust plagues were found in Aicun in the second district. Most of the masses were willing to fight, but they were afraid of trampling on the crops. When the mobilization to capture and kill was launched, they all refused to fight in their own fields. After mobilizing the masses for discussion and formulating discipline, they divided into shifts according to plots to fight. As a result, the fighting was fast and did not trample on the crops. Therefore, the masses asked to fight in their own fields first. After two days of capture and killing in the village, most of the locusts were eliminated. Aixin Village formed a team of one person from each household to fight in the fields where the insect disaster was the most serious, and the remaining people were scattered in the fields where there were fewer insects. It was stipulated that each person must hand in one jin of insects every day. This could not only concentrate efforts to destroy the areas where the insect disaster was serious, but also kill insects in their own fields. The masses were very willing, and 760 men, women and children were mobilized to capture 1,698 jin of insects in one day.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 打破迷信侥幸心理冀南继续捕灭害虫\n\n1948-09-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　打破迷信侥幸心理冀南继续捕灭害虫\n    【冀南电】冀南各地害虫已由十四个县发展到三十一个县。不少庄稼被吃光咬死，秋收大受损失。目前冀南全区，正以思想动员，组织保证，开展捕虫运动。运动开始时，群众思想上存在着迷信命运，打虫怕毁苗，和悲观麻痹，以及各扫门前雪的思想。针对群众以上思想情况，各地干部拿捕虫免害的事实，对群众进行了宣传教育，并率领村干部带头示范，以提高群众打虫信心。然后将群众组织起来，集体或分散捕打，到处展开捕虫运动。恩县五里长屯两个老太太，她自已不去打虫，还挨门敛香纸到庙上去祷告。结果别人地里的虫子打的日渐显少，她们地里的虫子因没打，庄稼几乎被虫快吃光了。这种事实不但教育她本人，而且也教育了群众。平乡一区蟋蟀成灾，此虫晚上出来吃庄稼，白天就藏起来。不少群众都认为该虫不如蚂蚱好打，表示没信心。有的还怕踏毁庄稼故意强调不能打。经区干领导村干和积极分子在一块地里将该虫捕灭后，才搞通了群众思想。然后，各村群众都积极打起来。二区艾村发现蝗灾，大多数群众本来愿意打，就是怕踏毁庄稼。当发动捕打时，都拒绝打自己地里的，经发动群众讨论，订出纪律，按地块分班排打，结果打的又快，并没有踏毁庄稼，于是群众纷纷要求先打自己地里的。全村经两天捕打，蝗虫大部消灭。艾辛庄以每户一人组成队，到虫灾最严重的地里去打，下剩的人分散在虫少的地里打，并规定每人每日须交一斤虫，这样既可集中力量，将虫灾严重的地方歼灭，又可在自己地里打虫，群众都很愿意，男女老幼动员起来七百六十名，一天内捕虫达一千六百九十八斤。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Reports from various sources: The US and France have experienced serious disagreements over plundering resources in the French-occupied zone of West Germany. According to a report by a \"Pravda\" journalist, French monopoly capitalists are intensifying their large-scale looting of resources in the French-occupied zone of Germany, as it is about to be merged with the US and British zones. To date, almost all steel, chemical, machinery manufacturing, and other industries have become the property of French monopoly capitalists. This action by the French side has greatly dissatisfied the US side. According to a TASS report citing the \"Berliner Zeitung\", US Military Governor Clay recently sent an ultimatum to the French side, demanding that France immediately cease the dismantling of military factories and heavy industrial factories in the French-occupied zone, and prohibit France from transporting and utilizing resources from the French-occupied zone. The ultimatum threatened France, stating that if the French side refused the above demands, the US side would cut off all economic ties between the French-occupied zone and the Anglo-American joint zone. At the same time, Britain also submitted a memorandum to France regarding this matter. In addition, according to a Telepress report, \"in order not to complicate the situation between Washington and Paris,\" the US government later instructed Clay to ease the pressure on France, put these issues aside temporarily, and resolve them together next spring when the French-occupied zone is merged with the Anglo-American joint zone.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 抢夺德国西部物资美英与法发生分歧\n\n1948-09-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　抢夺德国西部物资美英与法发生分歧\n    【新华社陕北四日电】各方报导：美、法两方为抢夺西德法占区物资发生严重分歧。据真理报记者报导：由于德境法占区即将和美英占区合并，法国独占资本家们正加紧大规模的掠夺该占区物资。截至现在为止，几乎所有钢铁工业、化学工业、机器制造业以及其他各种工业，都变成了法国独占资本家们的财产。法方此举已使美方大感不满。据塔斯社引柏林日报消息：美军总督克莱最近曾以最后通牒一件致送法方，要求法国立即停止对法占区军火工厂和重工业工厂的拆卸，并禁止法国搬运和利用法占区物资。最后通牒威胁法国称：如法方拒绝上项要求，则美方将截断法占区和英美联合占区一切经济上的联系。与此同时，英国也为此向法国提出备忘录。另据电通社消息：“为了不使华盛顿与巴黎之间的形势复杂化”，美政府后又训令克莱缓和对法国的压力，把这些问题暂时搁下，留待明年春天法占区与美英联合占区合并时一并解决。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 3rd: Xinhua News Agency is instructed to declare: The so-called letter from Zhou Enlai to Zhang Zhizhong published in certain newspapers and periodicals in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in July and August is entirely fabricated by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. According to reliable intelligence, as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's military defeats become increasingly obvious, especially after suffering disastrous defeats in the Kaifeng and Yudu campaigns, some American imperialist elements are increasingly losing confidence in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's combat capabilities. They are attempting to use reactionary warlords and politicians such as Li Zongren, He Yingqin, and Song Ziwen to deceive the Chinese people with a facade of peace and replace Chiang Kai-shek in continuing to oppose the Chinese people's revolutionary forces when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is even more defeated and unable to maintain its position. This conspiracy by the American imperialists has caused panic among the Chiang Kai-shek direct line bandit gang, especially the CC clique. Therefore, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department forged the so-called letter from Zhou Enlai to Zhang Zhizhong, issued it to party headquarters in various provinces and cities, and instructed Kuomintang secret agents in major cities to spread and fabricate rumors, thereby striking at Li, He, Song, etc., in order to unite the bandit gang internally and maintain the position of bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek. If asked why the CC clique wants to strike at Zhang Zhizhong, it is because Zhang Zhizhong, although loyal to Chiang Kai-shek, is worried about Chiang Kai-shek's military situation. When Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting with Zhang Zhizhong, Hu Zongnan, and others in Xi'an in late June, Zhang Zhizhong inquired whether Chiang Kai-shek could hold peace talks at the moment. After this sentence was leaked, the CC clique believed that it was necessary to strike at Zhang Zhizhong. However, the central purpose of the CC clique's spreading rumors is that they fear that the Americans are trying to use Li, He, Song, etc. to replace Chiang Kai-shek. For the sake of protecting Chiang Kai-shek and his direct line's position, they believe it is necessary to expose this in advance. As for the anti-communist speech drafted by the CC clique during this period and given to Weng Wenhao to read on the radio, it was mainly intended for the Americans. The purpose was to beg some Americans who had lost confidence in Chiang Kai-shek to continue to protect Chiang Kai-shek. They told these Americans that even the conspiracy to deceive the Chinese people with peace talks should not be allowed, as this would not only harm the interests of Chiang Kai-shek and his direct line, but also the interests of the United States. The truth about all the so-called peace rumors recently is this.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新华社奉命声明　揭露蒋匪捏造和谣\n\n1948-09-07\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新华社奉命声明\n  　揭露蒋匪捏造和谣\n    【新华社陕北三日电】新华社奉命声明：七八月间国民党统治区域某些报纸刊物上所登载的所谓周恩来给张治中的信，完全是蒋介石匪帮的捏造。根据可靠情报，当蒋介石匪帮的军事失败愈益明显，特别是在开封及豫东作战中遭受惨败以后，某些美帝国主义分子对于蒋介石匪帮的作战能力表示愈益丧失信心，企图利用李宗仁、何应钦、宋子文等反动军阀政客，于蒋介石匪帮更加失败无法维持时，以和平的假面具欺骗中国人民，代替蒋介石继续反对中国人民革命力量。美帝国主义者的这一阴谋，使蒋介石嫡系匪帮尤其是ＣＣ系感到恐慌，乃由国民党中央宣传部伪造所谓周恩来给张治中的信，发给各省市党部，并指使各大城市的国民党特务分子散布和谣，借此给李、何、宋等以打击，以便团结匪帮内部，保持匪首蒋介石的地位。若问ＣＣ系为什么要打击张治中，则因张治中虽然忠于蒋介石，却对蒋介石的军事形势感到忧虑。当六月下旬蒋介石召集张治中、胡宗南等在西安开会时，张治中曾探问蒋介石目前是否可以举行和谈。这句话泄露出来以后，ＣＣ系便认为有打击张治中的必要。但ＣＣ系散布和谣的中心目的，还是他们恐惧美国人企图利用李、何、宋等代替蒋介石，为保护蒋介石及其嫡系的地位起见，认为有预先揭露之必要。至于在这一期间由ＣＣ起草交给翁文灏在广播电台上照念的那篇反共演说词，则主要地是给美国人看的，其目的是哀求某些对蒋介石丧失信心的美国人继续对蒋介石给以保护。他们告诉这些美国人，就是欺骗中国人民的和谈阴谋也使不得，这不但对蒋介石及其嫡系的利益有妨碍，即对美国的利益也是有妨碍的。最近时期一切所谓和谣的真相，就是如此。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-07",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th. The famine that the Jin-Sui Liberated Area suffered last year, the worst in forty years, has now been basically overcome. In the past two years, Jin-Sui has suffered severe destruction and looting by the Yan and Fu bandits, as well as natural disasters. Last year in particular, severe drought affected the entire border region. In Shenfu, Baode, Ningwu and other places, two-thirds of the villages had agricultural harvests of less than one-third of a normal year, and half the population was starving this spring. Following the \"Spring Ploughing Mobilization Order\" and the \"Emergency Mobilization Order for Disaster Relief and Saving Lives\" issued by the CPC Jin-Sui Sub-bureau, the military and civilians throughout the region launched a broad mass-based production and disaster relief campaign this spring, achieving \"not a single mu of arable land left uncultivated.\" With the exception of a small number of villages in the marginal areas and new districts, where the cultivated area was slightly reduced due to severe disasters, the vast majority of counties expanded their cultivated area, and various crops were sown on time. This year, the sown area of summer crops generally increased by 50% compared to previous years, with some areas increasing by more than 100%, and harvests were generally abundant. In various parts of Northwest Shanxi, the summer harvest of wheat and beans increased by 10-20% compared to normal years. Although autumn crops in some areas suffered from a period of severe drought, after widespread heavy rains in late July, the estimated general harvest is also 70-80%. Only in Shenfu and other places, due to more severe drought and hail disasters this summer, are autumn crops not good. The local CPC committee and government have decided to continue carrying out production and disaster relief work. At present, the opening up of fallow land throughout the region is also coming to an end. According to preliminary statistics from six districts in four counties, including Shuoxian, Shenchi, and Pinglu, a total of more than 75,000 mu of fallow land has been opened up. Various places are now mobilizing and preparing to sow winter wheat and carry out autumn cultivation on a large scale, in order to lay the foundation for large-scale production next year.\n\nThe main experience of Jin-Sui's production and disaster relief in achieving such great results is, first of all, the deep and widespread mobilization of the masses, and the implementation of the principle of organizing the masses to develop production for self-reliance as the main method, supplemented by public assistance. Before entering spring ploughing, the Party and government put forward the slogans \"Produce with confidence, dare to manage, get rich through labor, and build a family through production,\" and used various methods to deeply publicize and explain the policy of developing production to the masses. The Jin-Sui Administrative Office also promulgated revised policies on public grain and military service burdens, and agricultural production reward measures. In areas that have undergone land reform, public grain is collected at the usual yield and at the same ratio regardless of class, to replace the previous progressive burden policy; military service is performed according to labor force; newly reclaimed wasteland is exempt from public grain for three years, and uncultivated wasteland for five years; and new water conservancy projects and increased production, as well as family sideline production, are not burdened. In response to the concerns of some people after land reform that land rights were unstable and that they would not be able to harvest what they planted, the slogan \"Stabilize land rights, whoever plants it harvests it\" was also put forward. Therefore, the production enthusiasm of all classes was greatly encouraged. Many middle peasants who had previously adopted a wait-and-see attitude and dared not develop production also actively produced. Landlords and rich peasants who originally did not work or worked very little also engaged in production, and women who had never worked the land before also participated in agricultural production in large numbers.\n\nIn addition to agricultural production, the Party and government also put forward the slogan \"Eat from the mountains if you're by the mountains, eat from the water if you're by the water,\" and vigorously organized sideline production for disaster victims. The first was to develop the transportation industry and exchange materials between regions. Men transported goods, women cultivated the land, and families with insufficient manpower and animal power cooperated and exchanged labor. The second was industry, mining, and handicrafts, such as coal mining, nitrate boiling, salt boiling, alkali boiling, sulfur mining, shipbuilding, papermaking, logging of timber and medicinal materials, and household weaving. Through such organized production, all localities have gained great benefits. For example, during the spring ploughing period in Shuoxian County, sideline production earned 3.2 billion agricultural currency, which could solve the food needs of more than 28,300 people for one month. In organizing mass sideline production, the government's economic and trade organs, the \"Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Publicly Operated Stores,\" and cooperatives became leaders and organizers, responsible for purchasing products and supplying grain and necessities at low prices. By implementing the above methods, the idea of simply relying on public assistance was also overcome.\n\nIn order to solve the food and seed difficulties of a large number of poor disaster victims, the leading Party and government organs of the border region clearly stipulated last autumn that the grain from land reform fruits should in principle not be distributed for the time being, but should be kept for unified adjustment this year according to the severity of the disaster at the county level. This enabled 70-80% of the poor disaster victims to obtain grain and seeds. At the same time, mutual assistance and borrowing movements were carried out between counties and counties, districts and districts, villages and villages, and households and households, based on the spirit of mutual help and friendship. Many relatively wealthy counties and counties with lighter disasters (such as Hexian, Daixian, etc.) donated large quantities of grain and other materials to counties with poorer and more severe disasters (such as Shenfu, Pinglu), and helped with production. Families with surplus grain also voluntarily lent grain, and governments at all levels gave praise and encouragement, guaranteeing repayment and giving a certain amount of interest; at the same time, district and village cadres, Communist Party members, and farmer representatives were called upon to promote mutual assistance and borrowing through their own exemplary actions.\n\nThe government provided necessary relief to areas that were severely affected by the disaster and were unable to help themselves. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce demarcated areas and issued low-interest or interest-free loans. For example, the Second District Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the production units of military organs lent 5,000 shi (260 jin per shi) of grain in Hequ, Baode, and other counties, with a monthly interest rate of 1%, and a fixed term of three months, to be repaid after the summer harvest. Personnel from various military organs voluntarily launched a large-scale movement to save food and clothing and donate money for disaster relief. Rear-area organs organized stretchers, transported wounded soldiers, and reduced the military service burden on the people, enabling them to devote their full efforts to production. Disaster relief teams or rush-planting shock brigades were organized to assist local authorities in distributing relief grain and loan grain in disaster areas, and to organize and help the masses with production. In addition, various materials for relieving poor disaster victims were distributed rationally, so that every grain of food was used for production. In terms of organizational leadership, the district and village representative meetings became a powerful leader in production and disaster relief. All production and disaster relief work was discussed and implemented through the representative meetings; the use and distribution of food and seeds were reviewed and approved by the representative meetings. The distribution of food and seeds was based on the severity of the disaster and the degree of actual difficulty, and the method of equal distribution was opposed. In order to overcome the simple reliance on relief in some areas, under the leadership of the representative meetings, a household-by-household investigation was carried out on the population, land, livestock, grain, seeds, and other conditions, and precise calculations were made on how much each village could solve on its own and how much the public needed to help. Many villages that originally requested \"relief\" were able to solve most of their problems on their own after such a detailed investigation and the formulation of production plans.\n\nIn addition, many villages organized production and disaster relief committees and production teams, and absorbed experienced farmers who were supported by the masses to specialize in leading production. This played a great role. In Jiangjiazuitou Village, Shenchi, the production team regularly planned and inspected the production of the entire village, increasing the cultivated area of the village by more than 30%; and organized all the able-bodied people to the production and disaster relief front, and also included landlords and idlers who did not work in the production team to urge them to produce. This ensured that their food and seeds were not wasted, that their land was not barren, and that they gradually transformed themselves through labor.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥大灾荒已克服　现正准备大量种麦秋耕\n\n1948-09-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥大灾荒已克服\n  　现正准备大量种麦秋耕\n    【新华社晋绥四日电】晋绥解放区去年所遭受的四十年来未有的灾荒，现已基本上克服。近两年来，晋绥遭受阎、傅匪严重的破坏掠夺与天灾，尤其是去年，亢旱遍及全边区，神府、保德、宁武等地有三分之二的村庄，农业收获物不及普通年成的三分之一，今春即有一半人口陷于饥饿中。经中共晋绥分局的“春耕动员令”及“救灾救死紧急动员令”号召后，今春全区军民开展了广泛的群众性的生产救灾运动，做到了“不荒一亩可耕种的土地”。除小部分边沿区及新区村庄因遭灾过重，耕地面积稍为缩小外，其余广大县分都扩大了耕地面积，各种作物都按时播种。今年夏季作物播种面积一般较往年增加百分之五十，部分地区增加一倍以上，且普遍丰收。晋西北各地夏季小麦、豆类收获较普通年景增加一二成。部分地区秋季庄稼虽受过一时期的亢旱，但经七月下旬普遍下透雨后，估计一般收获亦在七八成以上。仅神府等地因今夏遭旱、雹等灾较重，秋禾不好。当地中共党委及政府已决定继续进行生产救灾工作。目前全区开伏荒亦行将结束，仅据朔县、神池、平鲁等四县六个区初步统计，即共开了伏荒七万五千余亩。现各地正动员与准备大量播种冬麦与秋耕，以打下明年大生产的基础。\n    晋绥生产救灾获得如此巨大成绩，其主要经验首先是深入与广泛地发动了群众，贯彻了以组织群众发展生产自救为主，公家救济为辅的方针。在未进入春耕之前，党和政府即提出“放心生产，大胆刨闹（经营），劳动致富，生产发家”的口号，以各种方式来向群众深入宣传解释发展生产的政策。晋绥行署并颁布了重订公粮及军勤负担政策和农业生产奖励办法。经过土改的地区，以通常产量及不分阶层同一比例征收公粮，以代替过去累进的负担政策；采用按劳动力执军勤；垦熟荒三年、垦生荒五年免征公粮，对新修水利增产部分及家庭副业不负担。针对土改后部分人恐怕地权不稳定，种下收不成的顾虑，又提出“稳定地权，谁种谁收”的口号。因此，大大鼓舞了各阶层的生产积极性，许多原来采取等待观望，不敢发展生产的一部分中农也积极生产；原来不劳动或少许劳动的地主富农也从事生产，从未上过地的妇女也大量地参加了农业生产。\n    除农业生产外，党和政府又提出“在山吃山，在水吃水”的口号，用大力组织了灾民的副业生产。首先是发展运输业，交流各地物资。男人运输，妇女种地，一家人畜力不足者合作变工。其次是工矿手工业，如挖煤、熬硝、熬盐、熬硷、开采硫磺、造船、造纸、采伐林木药材、家庭纺织等。经过这样组织生产，各地都获得了很大利益。如朔县春耕期间副业生产得利农币三十二亿元，可解决二万八千三百余人一月的口粮。在组织群众副业生产中，政府的经济贸易机关“工商局、公营商店”及合作社成为领导者与组织者，负责收买产品，低价供给粮食和必需品。由于实行上述办法，也克服了单纯依靠公家救济的思想。\n    为解决大量贫苦灾民的口粮和种籽困难，边区党政领导机关去秋就明确规定，土改果实中的粮食原则上暂不分配，留着今年以县为单位按灾情轻重实行统一调剂。这样就使百分之七八十的贫苦灾民获得了粮食和种籽。同时，在县与县，区与区、村与村及户与户间本互助友爱精神，开展了互助互借运动。许多较富裕和灾情较轻县分（如和县、代县等）的人民，向较贫和灾情较重的县分（如神府、平鲁）赠送了大批的粮食和其他财物，帮助生产。有余粮人家，亦自愿借出粮食，各级政府并给予表扬鼓励，向其保证有借有还，给与一定的利息；同时号召区村干部，共产党员和农民代表以自己的模范行动推动大家互助互借。\n    政府对于灾情很重而无力自救的地区，进行了必要的救济。工商局划定地区发放了低利或无利借贷。如二分区工商局和部队机关生产单位，在河曲、保德等县贷粮五千石（每石二百六十斤），月息一分，定期三月，于夏收后归还。各部队机关人员自动发起大规模的节衣缩食募捐救灾运动，后方机关并组织担架，运输伤员，减轻人民的军勤负担，使其能全力进行生产；组织了救灾小组或抢种突击队到灾区协助当地发放救济粮和贷粮，及组织与帮助群众生产。此外，合理分配各种救济贫苦灾民的物资，使每一颗粮食都用于生产。在组织领导上，区村代表会成为生产救灾强有力的领导者，一切生产救灾工作都通过代表会讨论执行；口粮种籽的使用和分配都经过代表会审查通过。分配粮食种籽是按灾情轻重和实际困难程度，反对了平均分配方法。为克服某些地区单纯依赖救济，在代表会领导下，实行逐户调查人口、土地、耕畜、粮食、种籽等状况，精密计算各村自己可解决多少，公家须帮助多少。原来许多要求“救济”的村庄，经过这样细密调查和订生产计划后，绝大部分都能自己解决。\n    此外，许多村庄组织了生产救灾委员会和生产小组，吸收有经验而为群众拥护的农民专门领导生产。这发挥了很大的作用。神池姜家咀头村，生产小组经常计划和检查全村生产，使该村耕地面积增加百分之三十以上；并把一切能劳动的人都组织到生产救灾战线上，把不事劳动的地主和二流子，也编入生产小组里督促他们生产。这样使他们的口粮、种籽不被浪费，他们的土地不致荒芜，并从劳动中逐渐得到了改造。"

The congress heard reports from National Committee Chairman Foster, General Secretary Dennis, and Organization Secretary Winston, among others. In their reports, they fiercely criticized the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the Democratic and Republican parties, arguing that the policies of both parties, controlled by Wall Street, were leading to war, economic depression, and fascism. On August 6th, the congress adopted a program outlining the current tasks of the US Communist Party and elected a 13-member National Committee headed by Foster and Dennis. Foster and Dennis were re-elected as Chairman and General Secretary of the National Committee, respectively. The congress closed on the evening of the 6th.\n\nThe congress, in its adopted program, emphasized that no external force threatens the United States, and that the current US military buildup is an attempt by monopoly capital to establish world domination. The program also stated that the Soviet Union is the most solid pillar of peace; therefore, the Communist Party calls for a return to Roosevelt's peace policy and the implementation of friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. The program calls for an end to the \"Cold War,\" the repeal of the conscription law, the reduction of massive armaments, the consolidation of the United Nations organization as an instrument of world peace, the completion of peaceful settlements for a unified and democratic Germany and Japan based on the Yalta Agreement, the withdrawal of US troops from China, South Korea, and Greece, and the abandonment of the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine. Regarding domestic policy, the program calls for the abolition of the rule of monopoly capital, the root cause of reactionary fascism and war, the consolidation of democratic principles, and the struggle to improve people's living standards. The program specifically demands an end to the lynching of Black people, the abolition of poll taxes, and all forms of discrimination against Black people. The program declares that the Communist Party of the United States actively supports the recently formed Progressive Party in Philadelphia and will, along with millions of other Americans, support the Progressive Party's candidates. This party is a grand alliance of workers, farmers, Black people, youth, liberal professionals, and small business owners, and is an anti-monopoly capital, anti-fascist, and anti-war party. However, the program also points out that the Communist Party and Wallace's Progressive Party have different opinions on fundamental and tactical issues. The Communist Party firmly believes that only a socialist society can bring lasting peace.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美共召开十四届全代会　福斯特等猛抨民主共和两党反动政策通过政纲要求取消独占资本反动政权\n\n1948-09-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美共召开十四届全代会\n  　福斯特等猛抨民主共和两党反动政策通过政纲要求取消独占资本反动政权\n    【新华社陕北四日电】纽约迟到消息：八月三日至六日，美国工人阶级的先锋队——美国共产党于纽约召开党的第十四届全国代表大会。大会听取了全国委员会主席福斯特、总书记但尼斯及组织书记温斯顿等的报告。他们在报告中猛烈抨击民主党与共和党的反动的对内对外政策，认为两党的政策是导向战争、经济萧条及法西斯主义的政策，都是由华尔街控制的。大会于八月六日通过了规定美共当前任务的政纲，并选出以福斯特、但尼斯为首的由十三人组成的全国委员会。福斯特与但尼斯分别连任全国委员会的主席与总书记。大会于六日晚闭幕。\n    大会在其通过的政纲中着重指出：没有任何外来力量威胁着美国，美国现在的备战乃是独占资本建立世界统治的企图。政纲中又指出，苏联是和平最坚固的柱石，因此，共产党号召回到罗斯福的和平政策，实行对苏友好合作。政纲要求停止“冷战”，废止征兵法，缩减庞大军备，巩固世界和平工具——联合国组织，根据雅尔塔协定为统一与民主的德国及日本完成和平解决办法，撤退中国、南朝鲜及希腊的美军，废弃马歇尔计划与杜鲁门主义。在对内政策方面，政纲中要求取消反动法西斯主义战争根源的独占资本的政权，巩固民主原则并为改进人民生活水准而斗争。政纲特别要求取消对黑人的非刑拷打，取消人头税以及一切歧视黑人的行为。政纲中声明，美国共产党积极支持不久前在费城成立的进步党，并将和千百万其他美国人一起，拥护进步党的候选人。该党是工人、农民、黑人、青年、自由职业者小企业主的大联合，又是反对独占资本的、反法西斯的，反战争的政党。但政纲同时指出：共产党和华莱士的进步党在基本的及策略的问题上，意见并不相同。共产党坚决相信，只有社会主义的社会才能有永久的和平。"

Their epic struggle was reported in detail and vividly by Ouyang Zurun, a representative of Shanghai workers, at the Sixth National Labor Congress, arousing great concern and respect from the worker representatives of the liberated areas for their worker brothers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The following is an excerpt of the report:\n\n    Since Japan's surrender in 1945, the anti-Chiang and anti-American struggle of Shanghai workers can be divided into three stages.\n  　The first stage: from the factory protection and resumption of work movement after August 15th to the anti-civil war and demand for peace struggle climax on June 23, 1946.\n\n    From the first day of the Japanese surrender, Shanghai workers launched the struggle to protect factories and eliminate traitors. Led by the machine workers and cotton mill workers in the Hudong and Huxi industrial areas, a struggle was launched against the traitors and running dogs. The struggle continued for three or four months, and the workers received relief funds, severance pay, victory bonuses, and supplies such as rice, cloth, and oil. They also organized armed pickets, seized guns from the Japanese army, and guarded factories and warehouses day and night, preserving a large amount of raw materials and protecting cotton mills (Shanghai has more than 2 million spindles, accounting for half of the country), machine factories, and shipyards. Workers in the Hudong district also organized a joint picket headquarters of 18 major factories, checking and patrolling at important intersections and passages, preventing the enemy and puppets from smuggling goods. At that time, the Shanghai workers were preparing to welcome the New Fourth Army to liberate Shanghai. However, in order to strive for peace and democracy, the New Fourth Army did not occupy Shanghai and reluctantly withdrew to northern Jiangsu. However, the Kuomintang's \"takeover\" officials flew in from the sky and crawled out from the ground to \"take over\" the factories and warehouses. The Shanghai workers handed over the factories they had protected, only making one request - \"Start work immediately.\" But the \"takeover\" officials seized the factories and warehouses, putting up seals on the front door during the day and secretly transporting materials and machines away by truck from the back door at night. Some even set fire to eliminate traces, such as the sale of military supplies from the Japanese military headquarters on North Sichuan Road, and the strange fires in Maochang Cold Storage and Huangpu Warehouse, which were well-known major cases of takeover corruption in Shanghai. Large enterprises and factories were seized by Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital, organizing so-called China Textile, China Silk, and Wool Textile companies, implementing comprehensive control; the remaining dilapidated old factories were sold to national capitalists at a discount. These officials were busy with the takeover and not only did not talk about starting work, but also slandered the workers who demanded work as \"puppet workers.\" As a result, the remaining illusions of some workers about the Kuomintang were shattered. The workers further organized and carried out the first demonstration and march after the victory, shouting slogans such as \"Corrupt officials get rich, workers suffer,\" and \"Victory in the War of Resistance, factories close down.\" As a result, the workers successfully fought for the resumption of work at the end of the year.\n\n    Although the struggle to resume work was victorious, the lives of the workers were still not guaranteed. For example, the price of rice had increased 400,000 times compared to before the war, while wages had only increased 100,000 times. Therefore, a general strike struggle was launched in various industries and factories throughout Shanghai to increase the base salary, calculate wages according to the cost of living index, and demand freedom to organize trade unions, year-end bonuses, and welfare benefits. From the day of victory until April of the following year, there was the joint general strike of more than 100,000 workers in more than a dozen public and private cotton mills in the city, which forced the capitalists to accept the workers' 18 conditions. First, in Chiang Kai-shek's state-owned enterprises, there were strikes by the Jianghai Customs, the Four Banks employees, and Longhua Airport, strikes by telecommunications employees, a broom parade by more than 3,000 sanitation workers of the Health Bureau, a dung cart parade by night soil collectors, and the collective resignation of all civil servants of the municipal government. Secondly, there were strikes by French-owned water and electricity workers, British-owned water and electricity workers, gas workers, and American-owned electricity workers, followed by the involvement of machinery, printing, wool textiles, the six major department stores, hardware, and other industries. Even the bathhouse industry, barbershop industry, hotel industry, and shoemaker industry, which were more deeply controlled by feudal gangs, also participated. These strikes, whether for a few hours, a few days, or a few months, although suppressed, mostly achieved victory. This was an unprecedented wave of strikes since the Japanese surrender. Only the strike of the Central Printing Factory was suppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries with military and police blockades, and more than 100 employees were dismissed and arrested.\n\n    In addition to the struggle for livelihood, the Shanghai workers also launched a movement to expose traitors and demand democracy. For example, the employees of Xinxin Company exposed the company's manager, Li Ze, who had colluded with the Japanese invaders to loot cotton and iron materials and had served as a puppet business unification director. The employees of Kangyuan Cotton Mill exposed Xiang Kangyuan, the manager of the factory and a puppet advisory committee member. These actions exposed the Kuomintang reactionary group's traitorous crime of sheltering traitors. In April 1946, female workers in Shanghai cotton mills held a public opinion poll to oppose the Kuomintang's \"National Assembly representatives\" fixed ten years ago, and elected their own female National Assembly representatives, preparing to participate in the National Assembly under the Political Consultative Conference line. Comrade Tang Guifen of the Shanghai delegation attending this conference was honorably elected. On May Day, Shanghai workers held a parade and celebration meeting with nearly 100,000 people from more than 200 units, and successively held memorial services for the \"April 8th\" martyrs and Yu Zai, the Kunming \"December 1st\" democratic martyr.\n\n    Through continuous struggle, the Shanghai workers organized a strong force of their own, established democratic trade unions representing the interests of the workers and leading the workers' struggle, and trained many outstanding worker leaders, all of whom were deeply supported by the vast number of workers.\n\n    In early June 1946, the Shanghai working class, students, democratic人士, and national capitalists organized a united front against civil war and demanding peace. On June 23, nearly 100,000 workers from various industries in the city participated in a demonstration and march against the civil war, gathering at the North Railway Station to welcome the petition delegation to Nanjing, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek stop the civil war and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Although the Kuomintang military, police, secret agents, and special agents were dispatched to sabotage, they were deterred by the huge momentum of the masses and did not dare to act. The railway workers more bravely refused the station master's order not to start the train and automatically drove the train out of the North Railway Station to Nanjing.\n\n    In the first stage of the struggle, the Shanghai workers organized their own forces, improved their living conditions, demonstrated the power of the workers, increased their confidence in the struggle, recognized the true colors of the Kuomintang reactionary group and American imperialism, and began to move from an economic-based struggle to a clear anti-Chiang and anti-American struggle.\n\n　　The second stage: from the \"June 23rd\" Grand Parade to the major strike of municipal enterprise workers in September 1947.\n\n    During this period, the struggle of the workers became more clearly and resolutely a political struggle against American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary group. The struggle greatly educated the Shanghai workers and people, further strengthened the worker ranks, and enriched the struggle experience. The Kuomintang reactionary group, which was suffering successive military defeats, also changed its approach to the worker movement from secret sabotage to open arrests and massacres.\n\n    In July 1946, workers in more than 200 silk factories in Shanghai launched a two-month strike. This was the longest strike since the victory of the War of Resistance. As a result, the strike was victorious, and the workers won the right to calculate wages based on the cost of living index.\n\n    In February 1947, the Shanghai three-district department store guild, led by Yong'an, Xinxin, and other six major companies, launched a movement to love Chinese goods and resist American goods in order to oppose the dumping of American goods and save the crisis of national industry and commerce. On February 9, an enlarged meeting was held, attended by more than 400 employee representatives and industry and commerce representatives. Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, Ma Yinchu, and other democratic figures also gave speeches at the meeting. The Kuomintang authorities actually sent more than 500 thugs to rush into the venue, beating anyone they saw and destroying anything they could find. More than 20 department store employees were seriously injured, and Liang Renda, an employee of Yong'an Company, died of his injuries that afternoon. The next day, the department store guild launched a counterattack against the reactionary rulers, established the Liang Renda Funeral Committee, and social figures and workers from all walks of life in Shanghai also organized the Liang Renda Martyr Tragedy Support Association. Seeing the growing strength of the workers, the Kuomintang reactionaries hastily tried to buy off Liang Renda's family with 100 million yuan, which was severely rejected, and had to agree to punish the murderers.\n\n    At this time, the Kuomintang reactionary group implemented the so-called \"economic emergency measures,\" freezing the cost of living index at the December 1946 level, so the lives of the workers were not guaranteed and continued to deteriorate. On May 1, Kuomintang Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Shanghai Kuomintang Chairman Fang Zhi, and others usurped this great festival, forced workers to participate in the memorial meeting, and stipulated anti-communist slogans, attempting to organize an anti-communist demonstration. However, the workers shouted the slogans \"Unfreeze the cost of living index\" and \"Oppose freezing the cost of living index\" at the meeting. These slogans expressed the most pressing demands of the broad masses of workers in Shanghai. Then, demonstrations by machine, silk weaving workers, American electricity, French electricity, and cotton spinning workers broke out successively to protest against the freezing of the cost of living index. When the French electricity workers petitioned the Shanghai Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau, they happened to meet the petition procession of middle school students from the city opposing the scientific \"unified examination.\" The two teams merged and shouted each other's slogans. As a result, both sides won victory.\n\n    After that, the Shanghai workers' struggle turned to enterprises operated by imperialism and enterprises of the Kuomintang municipal government, and successively carried out struggles demanding occupational security, opposing arrests, and guaranteeing human rights. In September, the Kuomintang reactionary group attempted to draft workers in Shanghai factories and levy \"wage income tax\" on workers, which aroused the resistance of the six major municipal enterprises, won the sympathy and support of the broad masses of citizens, and achieved victory.\n\n    On September 22, all 2,000-plus electricity workers gathered at the Social Affairs Bureau to protest the arrest of six editors of the \"Electricity Worker Monthly\" by Kuomintang special agents. Kuomintang special agent heads Zheng Jiemin, Wu Guozhen, Xuan Tiewu, etc., then planned a large-scale persecution of Shanghai workers. That night, they arrested electricity trade union representatives and activists on a large scale. On the 25th, the Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau openly disbanded the electricity trade union and announced a list of trade union leaders wanted. Then, they sealed up the three-district department store trade union and arrested dozens of people. However, the workers' resistance struggle became even more resolute and heroic. On the 27th, French electricity workers went on strike to resist handing over a list of trade union activists, persisting for a week. Kuomintang military police and labor scabs entered the factory, attempting to sabotage the strike, but were resolutely resisted by the workers' picket team and workers. At that time, 96 workers were arrested, but the strike still persisted. The Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau then ordered the disbandment of the French electricity trade union. At this time, the entire Shanghai was shrouded in the terror of the Kuomintang military, police, secret agents, and special agents. However, the workers' heroic struggle continued one after another. In late October, more than 200 leaders of the Shanghai Democratic Trade Union jointly issued a protest against the persecution by the Kuomintang reactionary group. At the same time, many trade union leaders of the editorial staff had to temporarily part with the workers. When these trade union leaders who were forced to leave said goodbye to the workers, the workers said with excitement: \"You go! When the People's Liberation Army arrives, we can meet again!\"\n\n    Third stage: Unyielding resistance against the enemy's open arrests and massacres.\n\n    Following the September general strike, no matter how openly the Kuomintang rulers terrorized and suppressed, a strike broke out at the Dalu Iron Factory in October, successfully hitting the conspiracy of capitalists colluding with bureaucratic capital to transfer machinery to Guangdong (the reactionary rulers attempted to establish their last base in South China). The Shanghai puppet General Labor Union wanted workers to donate money to build a meeting place. Secret agent head Lu Jingshi had previously feasted the trade union representatives, trying to win them over. On November 12, the puppet General Labor Union convened a meeting of trade union representatives, but everyone still rejected the proposal to donate money. The representatives said in unison: \"We represent the interests of the workers and cannot sell out the workers, otherwise we will be beaten.\" After saying that, they dispersed in a huff. Lu Jingshi was caught between laughter and tears, flew into a rage, and ordered the factory owners to deduct workers' wages as a construction fee for the puppet General Labor Union. Some factories run by imperialism and bureaucratic capital carried out his order, but the workers immediately went on strike to protest, and the capitalists had to reissue the full amount. Until now, the puppet General Labor Union still has to live in its original dilapidated temple.\n\n    This year, January, there was also a struggle by more than 10,000 dance hall employees against the Kuomintang Social Affairs Bureau's closure of dance halls, threatening and extorting huge sums of money.\n\n    Soon after, the heroic and outstanding struggle of the workers of Shenxin No. 9 Factory resisting the massacre by the military police took place. Shenxin No. 9 Factory is the largest cotton mill in Shanghai, with more than 7,500 employees, four-fifths of whom are female workers. On January 28 (Lunar New Year's Eve), the factory employees went on strike to protest the capitalists' deduction of rationed rice, deduction of income tax, and the factory's unreasonable oppression of workers. The more than 7,000 workers were very well organized, with picket teams maintaining order, and song and drama teams conducting education and entertainment activities. On the morning of the 2nd, more than 5,000 plainclothes police officers, special agents, and armed forces of the Garrison Command, tanks, machine guns, American-style carbines, tear gas, and cavalry surrounded the factory on all sides. Secret agent heads Lu Jingshi, Xuan Tiewu, etc., said to the striking masses from armored vehicles: \"Don't be exploited by the Communist Party, go home and celebrate the New Year.\" The workers unanimously replied: \"We want to live, no matter what party, whoever seeks welfare for the workers, we will support them!\" Seeing that threats and deception could not shake the workers' determination, these secret agent heads ordered a charge to be sounded at 5:30 p.m., directing the military police to attack the workers. Armored vehicles first rushed open the factory gate, and machine guns swept at the unarmed workers, and tear gas was released. The blood of the workers was boiling. One worker immediately jumped onto the factory's large truck, accelerated and charged at the armored vehicle, finally冲出ing the armored vehicle out of the factory. For a time, thousands of workers also used iron rods, stones, and machine parts, desperately throwing them at the military police. The female workers on the roof used water hoses to spray downwards, and threw anything they could lift downwards. Batches of workers fell down, and batches of them rushed up again. But the workers' flesh and blood could not withstand machine guns, tanks, and tear gas. Finally, the military police rushed into the factory. The cruel massacre lasted for two hours, killing and wounding more than 100 workers, arresting more than 200 people, and dismissing more than 1,000 workers. Currently, there are still 38 people imprisoned. A female worker picket captain, after being arrested, was severely tortured, asked to confess the list of strike leaders and picket teams, but she never said a word. The beasts pulled out her fingernails, but she only shouted; \"Workers, remember this tragedy!\"\n\n    Afterwards, the Kuomintang reactionary group blocked the news, saying that only three people were killed or injured. But they couldn't stop the mouths of 7,000 workers. This unprecedented tragedy immediately spread throughout Shanghai, spread throughout the country, and shocked the world's workers!\n\n    Workers and students from all industries in Shanghai indignantly organized donations to provide support, and stipulated that at 2:22 p.m. on February 22, all Shanghai workers and students would wear black紗 two inches and two points wide to commemorate the \"February 22\" tragedy. At the same time, the \"Shen Jiu Incident Support Association\" was organized to prepare for a memorial service for the fallen martyrs. The Kuomintang reactionary group not only strictly prohibited people from wearing black紗, but also conspired to sabotage the memorial service, arresting more than 200 worker leaders from various industries on the eve of the memorial service. The arrest terror action continued for a week.\n\n    No matter how the Kuomintang reactionary group massacred and suppressed, the workers not only did not fear and retreat in the slightest, but instead adopted various more ingenious ways of struggle. This year, in April, the workers of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway carried out a \"silent work\" struggle. The workers lay on the rails without saying a word. When the Kuomintang authorities sent people to interfere, no one uttered a sound. They used this clever way to protect the worker leaders and achieved the victory of increasing wages.\n\n    ★　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　\n　　★　\n\n    The Shanghai workers have never succumbed under heavy oppression, and they have never been negative and disappointed. On the contrary, their ranks are stronger and more powerful. They have already paid the price, and they firmly believe that the blood of the martyrs has not been shed in vain. They all know that the day when the People's Liberation Army will liberate them is not far away.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英勇斗争中的上海工人　上海工人代表欧阳祖润在劳大报告\n\n1948-09-07\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英勇斗争中的上海工人\n  　上海工人代表欧阳祖润在劳大报告\n    上海的工人两年多来向国民党反动当局进行了英勇的斗争，并且在斗争中更提高了自己的政治觉悟，扩大了自己的队伍，成为中国人民解放斗争中的一个重要力量。他们的可歌可泣的斗争事迹，在第六次全国劳动大会上，由上海工人代表欧阳祖润作了详尽而生动的报告，引起了解放区工人代表对国民党统治区工人兄弟的极大关怀与崇敬。兹将这一报告内容摘志如下：\n    从一九四五年日本投降以来，上海职工的反蒋反美斗争可以分为三个阶段。\n  　第一阶段：从“八一五”后的护厂复工运动到一九四六年六月二十三日反内战要和平的斗争高潮。\n    从日寇投降头一天起，上海职工便开展了护厂、肃奸斗争。以沪东沪西两工业区的机器工人、纱厂工人为首，发动了对汉奸、走狗的斗争。斗争继续了三四个月，工人得到了救济金、解散费、胜利金及米布油等物资，并组织了武装纠察队，夺取日军的枪支，日夜看守工厂仓库，保存了大宗原料，保护了纱厂（上海的纱锭有二百多万，占全国半数）、机器厂、造船厂等。沪东区工人并组织了十八个大厂的联合纠察队指挥部，在重要路口孔道检查巡逻，防止了敌伪的偷运。当时上海工人是准备迎接解放上海的新四军的。但为了争取和平民主，新四军没有进占上海，忍痛向苏北撤退。而国民党的“劫收”大员却从天上飞来，从地下钻出来把工厂仓库“劫收”了。上海工人把自己保护下来的工厂交给他们，只提出一个要求——“立刻开工”。但是“劫收”大员将工厂仓库抢到手，白天在前门贴封条，夜晚便从后门把物资机器用卡车偷运走，有的甚至放一把火消灭痕迹，如北四川路的日军司令部军用物资的变卖，如茂昌冷藏库、黄浦仓库的怪火，便是上海人民周知的劫收贪污大罪案。大的企业工厂则都被国民党官僚资本所劫收，组织所谓中纺、中蚕、毛纺等公司，实行全面统制；剩下一些破烂不堪的旧厂，才折价卖给民族资本家。这些大员忙于劫收，不但不谈开工，反污蔑要求开工的工人是“伪工人”，于是部分工人中对国民党残存的幻想，也都破灭了。工人们进一步组织起来，进行了胜利后第一次的示威游行，高呼“贪官发财，工人遭殃”，“抗战胜利，工厂关门”等口号。结果，工人胜利地争取了在年底复工。\n    复工斗争虽然胜利了，但工人生活仍没有保障。如米价比战前涨了四十万倍，而工资才增十万倍。因而全沪各业各厂普遍展开了增加底薪、按生活指数计算工资，要求组织工会自由、年赏、福利等的罢工斗争。从胜利日始截至第二年四月止，先后有十一月全市公私营纱厂十余万工人的联合大罢工，迫使资方接受了工人的十八个条件。首先，蒋匪国营企业中有江海关、四行职工、龙华飞机场的罢工，电讯职工的罢工，卫生局三千余清道夫的扫帚游行，粪夫的粪车游行，以及市府全体公务员的总辞职。其次则有法商水电工人、英商水电工人及煤气工人、美商电力工人等的罢工，继之卷入的有机器、印刷、毛纺、六大百货公司、五金等行业，连封建帮会统治较深的浴室业、理发业、旅馆业、皮鞋匠等也都参加了。这些罢工，或数小时，或数天，或数月，虽遭到镇压，但大都取得了胜利。这是日本投降以来空前的一次罢工潮。仅有中央印刷厂的罢工，被国民党反动派用军警封锁镇压下去，开除并逮捕了一百余职工。\n    除了生活斗争之外，上海职工又展开检举汉奸以及要求民主的运动。如新新公司职工检举曾勾结日寇搜刮棉铁物资并曾任伪商统一理事的该公司经理李泽，康元制纱厂职工检举该厂经理伪咨询委员项康元等，暴露了国民党反动集团庇护汉奸的卖国罪行。一九四六年四月上海纱厂女工为反对国民党十年前固定的“国大代表”而举行了一次民意测验，选举自己的女国大代表，准备参加政协路线下的国大。此次参加大会的上海代表团汤桂芬同志，光荣当选。五一节，上海工人举行了包括二百多单位近十万人的游行庆祝大会，并先后举行了纪念“四八”烈士和昆明“一二、一”民主烈士于再的追悼大会。\n    从不断的斗争中，上海职工自己组织起了强大的队伍，建立了代表工人利益领导工人斗争的民主工会，锻炼出许多优秀的职工领袖。都深得广大工人的拥护。\n    一九四六年六月初，上海工人阶级和学生与民主人士，民族资本家，组织了反内战要和平的统一战线。六月二十三日，全市各业将近十万工人参加了反内战的示威游行，集合在北站欢送请愿代表团赴南京，要求蒋介石停止内战，实行政协决议。国民党军、警、宪、特虽武装出动，准备破坏，终慑于群众浩大的声势，未敢动手。而铁路工人更英勇地拒绝站长不许开车的命令，自动将火车开出北站，驶往南京。\n    在第一阶段的斗争中，上海的职工组织了自己的队伍，得到了生活的改善，表现了工人力量，提高了斗争信心，认清了国民党反动集团和美帝国主义的面目，开始从以经济为主的斗争走上明确的反蒋反美斗争的道路。\n　　第二阶段：从“六二三”大游行到一九四七年九月的市政企业工人大罢工。\n    工人在这一期间的斗争，更加具有明确和坚决的反对美帝国主义及国民党反动集团的政治斗争的性质。在斗争中大大教育了上海的职工和人民，进一步锻炼了职工队伍，更丰富了斗争经验。而在军事上节节失败的国民党反动集团对职工运动也从秘密破坏变为公开的逮捕和屠杀。\n    一九四六年七月，上海二百多家丝厂工人掀起了两个月的罢工。这是抗战胜利后最长的一次罢工。结果获得胜利，工人争得了依生活指数计算工资。\n    一九四七年二月，上海三区的百货业公会，以永安、新新等六大公司为首，为反对美货倾销，为挽救民族工商业危机，发起了爱用国货抵制美国运动。二月九日召开扩大会议，到会职工代表及工商代表四百余人；会上并有郭沫若、邓初民、马寅初等民主人士演讲。国民党当局竟派五百余打手冲进会场，逢人便打，见物就毁，二十余名百货业职工受重伤，永安公司职工梁仁达当天下午因伤重逝世。第二天，百货公会便展开了向反动统治者的反击，成立梁仁达治丧委员会，上海社会人士及各界职工也纷起组织梁仁达烈士惨案后援会。国民党反动派见职工声势壮大，一面手忙脚乱的想以一万万元收买梁仁达家属，遭到了严止的拒绝，一面不得不答应惩办凶手。\n    这时，国民党反动集团实行了所谓“经济紧急措施”，把生活指数冻结在一九四六年十二月水平，职工生活因而毫无保障，愈趋恶化。五月一日，国民党上海市长吴国桢、社会部长谷正纲、上海国民党主委方治等，僭用这个伟大的节目，强迫工人参加纪念会，规定了反共口号，企图组织一个反共示威游行。但工人们即在这次大会上喊出了“解冻生活指数”“反对冻结生活指数”的口号。这些口号，喊出了上海广大劳动群众的最迫切要求。于是先后爆发了机器，丝织工人，美电、法电、棉纺等工人的抗议冻结生活指数的示威游行。当法电工友在上海国民党社会局请愿时，恰巧和全市中学生反对科学式的“会考”的请愿行列相遇。两个队伍就汇合在一起，互相喊出对方口号。结果双方都争取得了胜利。\n    此后，上海职工斗争即转入帝国主义经营的企业和国民党市政府的企业，连续进行了要求职业保障、反对逮捕、保障人权等斗争。九月，国民党反动集团企图在上海工厂抽丁，并向工人抽“工资所得税”，当激起了六大市政企业的反抗斗争，取得广大市民的同情和拥护，获得了胜利。\n    九月二十二日，电力职工全体二千余人，为抗议国民党特务逮捕“电工月报”的六位编辑，齐集社会局请愿。国民党特务头子郑介民、吴国桢、宣铁吾等乃布置了对上海工人的大规模迫害。是晚，即大肆逮捕电力工会代表和积极分子。二十五日，国民党社会局又明令解散电力工会，并公布通缉工会领袖名单。接着，查封了三区百货业工会，捕去数十人。但工人们的反抗斗争也更加坚决英勇。二十七日法电工人为反抗交出工会积极分子名单，举行罢工，坚持了一个星期。国民党军警和工贼进工厂，企图破坏罢工，遭到了工人纠察队及工人的坚决的抗拒。当时工人被捕去九十六人，但罢工仍坚持着。国民党社会局于是又下令解散法国工会。这时，全上海均在国民党军、警、宪、特的恐怖笼罩下。但工人的英勇斗争，仍此伏彼起。十月下旬，上海民主工会二百余领袖即联名发表了反对国民党反动集团迫害的抗议书，同时，许多编缉的工会领袖不得不暂时与工人们分别。当这些被迫出走的工会领袖与工友们话别时，工友们都激昂的说：“你们去吧！人民解放军到来的时候，我们又可以见面的！”\n    第三阶段：不屈不挠对抗敌人的公开逮捕和屠杀。\n    继九月大罢工后，不管国民党统治者怎样公开恐怖镇压，十月又爆发了大陆铁厂罢工，胜利的打击了资方与官僚资本勾结，将机器向广东转移的阴谋（反动统治者企图在华南建立他们最后的基地）。上海伪总工会为了建造会所，要工人捐款。特务头子陆京士事先曾大宴工会代表，想从中笼络收买。十一月十二日，伪总工会召集各工会代表开会，但大家依然否决了捐款的提议。代表们齐说：“我们代表工人利益，不能出卖工人，不然就要挨打。”说后一哄而散。陆京士哭笑不得，暴跳如雷，下令各厂资方扣除工人工资作为伪总工会建立费。有些帝国主义和官僚资本的厂方执行了他的命令，但工人马上罢工抗议，资方只得照数补发。直到现在，伪总工会还只得住在原来那所破庙里。\n    今年一月，又发生了万余舞业职工反对国民党社会局封闭舞厅，威胁勒索巨款的斗争。\n    此后不久，就发生了申新九厂工人英勇卓绝的抵抗军警屠杀的斗争。申新九厂是上海最大的纱厂，有职工七千五百余，其中五分之四都是女工。一月二十八日（阴历年夜），该厂职工为了反抗资方克扣配给米、扣所得税，反抗厂方无理压迫工人，举行了罢工。七千余工人组织得很严密，有纠察队维持秩序，有歌咏、话剧队等进行教育和文娱活动。二日上午，五千余名单警特务和警备司令部的武装部队、坦克车、机关枪、美式卡宾、催泪弹以及马队，就把工厂四面包围，特务头子陆京士、宣铁吾等在铁甲车上向罢工群众说：“你们别受共产党利用，快回家过年。”工人一致的回答是：“我们要生活，不管什么党，谁为工人谋福利，我们就拥护谁！”这些特务头子见威胁和欺骗都不能动摇工人的决心。至晚五时半，宣铁吾下令吹冲锋号，指挥军警向工人进攻。一辆辆装甲车先冲开了工厂大门，机枪向徒手工人齐扫，并施放了催泪弹。工人们的血都沸腾起来了。有一个工友立即跳上工厂的大卡车，开足马力向装甲车冲去，终于把装甲车冲出厂外。一时数千工人也都用铁棍、石头和机器零件，拼命向军警投掷；在屋顶上的女工们，用水龙向下冲，用一切拿得动的东西向下掷。工人一批批的倒下去，一批批地又冲上来。但工人的血肉当然抵不住机枪坦克和催泪弹。终于被军警冲进了工厂。残酷的屠杀进行了二小时，死伤工友一百余人，被捕的二百多人，被开除的工人一千余。现尚有三十八人被囚在牢里，一位女工纠察队长被捕后，受着严刑拷打，要她供出罢工领袖和纠察队名单，但她始终一字不吐；野兽们把她的手指甲都拔了出来，但她只叫喊着；“工友们要记住这场惨案！”\n    事后国民党反动集团封锁新闻，说只死伤三人。但他们封不住七千工人的嘴，这空前的惨案马上传遍了上海，传遍了全国，并震动了世界的职工！\n    上海各业工人以及学生，痛愤地组织了募捐支援，并规定于二月二十二日下午二时二十二分，全上海工友、学生佩带二寸二分宽的黑纱，纪念“二二”惨案。同时组织了“申九事件后援会”，准备为死难烈士开追悼会。国民党反动集团一面严禁人民戴黑纱；一面更阴谋破坏追悼会，在追悼会召开的前夜，逮捕了各业工人领袖二百余人。逮捕的恐怖行动继续一星期之久。\n    不管国民党反动集团怎样屠杀和镇压，工人不但丝毫没有畏惧退缩，相反地采取了各种各样更巧妙的斗争方式。今年四月，京沪铁路工人进行了“哑工”斗争。工人齐卧铁轨上一言不发，国民党当局派人来干涉，没有一个人哼声。他们就利用这种巧妙的方式，保卫了工人领袖，取得了增加工资的胜利。\n    ★　　　　　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★　　　　\n　　★　\n    上海职工，在重重压迫下面，始终没有屈服，始终没有消极失望，相反的，他们的队伍是更强大、更有力量了。他们已经付出了代价，并且深信先烈的血并没有白流，他们都知道人民解放军前去解放他们的日子已不还了。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社东北三日电）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. The Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was formally elected at the Labor Congress on the 20th of last month. From now on, the unified and highest leading body of the national labor movement has been established. Prior to the election, Comrade Li Lisan, on behalf of the presidium of the congress, explained the significance of the election and the presidium's proposals for the election principles. He stated: The election of the highest leading body of the national working class mass organization is the final agenda item of the Labor Congress; and for the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, it is the first item on the agenda, a great beginning. The establishment of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is not only the organizational unification of the national working class, but will also transform the unified thought and unified will of the congress into unified action. Therefore, the presidium of the congress proposed: (1) It is hoped that the elected executive committee members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (referred to as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereinafter) will include representatives from democratic trade unions in various regions of the country and representatives who truly have prestige among the working masses; at the same time, it is hoped that not only will representatives of manual laborers be elected, but also representatives of mental laborers—clerks, technicians, and administrative management personnel. The presidium especially hopes to pay attention to the election of labor heroes and production models, because they can play a great mobilizing role among the working class; (2) In order to take care of the above points, the presidium proposed that the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions consist of 81 members, including 59 official members and 22 alternate members; (3) It is proposed to leave 8 vacancies (6 official and 2 alternate) so that workers from newly liberated cities can have representatives to participate in the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions during the period from this congress to the next congress. The above proposals were unanimously approved by the audience. The congress also unanimously approved that, due to the different numbers of worker members represented by the delegates from various regions attending the meeting, each 2,000 members would be counted as one vote. The number of votes for each delegate from each delegation is as follows: China Labor Association and the Kuomintang-controlled area delegation each had 17 votes; the Northwest delegation had 5 votes each; the North China delegation had 8 votes each; the Northeast delegation had 1 vote each; the East China delegation had 10 votes each; and the Liangguang delegation had 1 vote each. A total of 1,440 votes.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Editorial\n\n　　The fundamental characteristic of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and one of the important conditions for its victorious development is the democracy within its troops under centralized leadership. This kind of democracy in the army is carried out under conditions of strict order. It does not abolish or weaken the discipline necessary for the army. On the contrary, it consolidates and strengthens discipline. It merely makes this discipline based on the interests of the people and the common interests and consciousness of the officers and soldiers, and becomes the discipline commonly observed by all personnel of the army. As early as 1928, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: \"Not only do the workers and peasants need democracy in China, but the army needs it even more urgently. The thorough implementation of democracy in the army will be an important policy to destroy the feudal mercenary army in China. Because the life of soldiers in the feudal mercenary army is simply unbearable.\" At that time, in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army personally led by Comrade Mao Zedong, soldiers' committees were established, and officers were forbidden from beating soldiers, officers and soldiers wore and ate the same, enjoyed equal treatment, soldiers had freedom of assembly and speech, abolished cumbersome etiquette, economic affairs were thoroughly open, meals were managed by soldiers, and soldiers' representatives reviewed the final accounts. At that time, although there were only five cents of food money per day (rice was supplied by the local area), life was still good, and all personnel could share the leftovers (about sixty or seventy coins per person per day) for pocket money. After these measures were implemented, the soldiers were very satisfied, especially the new soldiers who had been captured from the Kuomintang army and joined the Red Army, who felt that the life in the Kuomintang army yesterday was obviously a different world from the life in the Red Army today. Therefore, the same soldier, who yesterday fought for the landlords, bureaucrats, and bourgeoisie, was still timid and did not move forward, but today, fighting for the workers and peasants, was twice as brave. This proves that democracy in the army has become one of the sources of the invincible strength of the Chinese People's Army.\n\n　　In the past year, after the People's Liberation Army implemented the \"three check-ups\" and \"speaking bitterness\" new-style rectification movements in various units, the democratic life of the troops has had many new creations. In the army, this democracy is divided into three aspects: political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy. The main points are as follows:\n\n　　1. Political Democracy: Before the new-style rectification, many troops had already carried out democratic evaluations of merits and demerits quite universally, followed by evaluations of casualties and technical creations. After the new-style rectification, democratic criticism was further developed in the troops, mainly evaluating party members and cadres.\n\n　　Evaluating party members includes opening up party branches, inviting non-party soldiers to give opinions on party members and branches, participating in the review and recommendation of new party members, and participating in the review of the conversion of probationary party members, etc.\n\n　　Evaluating cadres includes using democratic methods to inspect leadership, suggesting the selection and promotion of cadres, suggesting the removal of incompetent cadres, and democratically evaluating merits and demerits and discipline at war evaluation meetings, etc.\n\n　　This democratic movement is actually a broad movement of criticism and self-criticism in the army, and mainly the criticism of officers by soldiers, the criticism of party members by non-party masses, and the public self-criticism of cadres and party members among the masses. In this process of criticism, the firepower of criticism often focuses on the shortcomings of the criticized. Therefore, in the later stage of the democratic movement, that is, after the criticism, some focused on evaluating merits, and some held unity meetings, so that the results of the criticism achieved the purpose of strengthening unity and consolidating leadership.\n\n　　2. In terms of military democracy: it is developed from the democratic evaluation of merits and demerits in the meritorious service movement to the evaluation of casualties (related to the idea of loving soldiers on the battlefield), and then to the evaluation of technology. From this, it has developed into the currently universally implemented war evaluation. In addition, there is also the \"brainstorming meeting\" (some call it the \"Zhuge Liang meeting\") before the war, to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and inspire morale, overcome difficulties on the battlefield, and defeat the enemy. Some troops also hold meetings to discuss how to complete the task after accepting the task before the battle, and absorb correct opinions from the masses during the battle to correct shortcomings.\n\n　　In addition, in the method of evaluating battles after the war, some troops in East China and North China recently adopted the sand table method, arranging the actual situation of the war in the sand table, and conducting democratic inspection and evaluation according to the command and actions taken by each person during the battle, which can determine merits and demerits and study experiences and lessons. Doing so closely combines the actual situation of training and war.\n\n　　3. In terms of economic democracy: the main thing is to combat corruption and waste, the meals are managed by soldiers, and the accounts are published regularly. The company has an economic committee organization (those who have established soldiers' committees are subordinate to the soldiers' committee), and one economic member is elected for each platoon, and one economic representative (or economic officer) is elected for each squad.\n\n　　According to reports from various places, after the troops have earnestly and correctly implemented the above three aspects of democracy, they have shown a new atmosphere, and it is the most practical education for all kinds of personnel in the troops. Experience proves that as long as the democratic movement in the army is under correct leadership, for the purpose of improving and strengthening leadership and discipline, rather than for the purpose of undermining leadership and discipline, it can achieve great results. Here are three aspects to explain.\n\n　　1. After the implementation of political democracy, the troops have made the following progress:\n\n　　After the evaluation of party members, the prestige of the party has been improved, and many people have asked to join the party, all taking it as an honor to be a communist party member. In a certain company in Northeast China, twenty-three non-party members requested to join the party at the party evaluation meeting, and some even voluntarily paid party fees in advance. In various troops, there are many who voluntarily write applications to join the party and propose to be tested on the battlefield, and ask the party to posthumously recognize them as communist party members if they sacrifice on the battlefield. When liberated soldiers first come to our army, they often have a wrong understanding of our party. After the evaluation of the party, based on their own experience, and in contrast to the situation in the Kuomintang army, they realize that the Communist Party is truly upright and wholeheartedly serves the people. Some who had participated in the Kuomintang were moved, confessed, and declared their withdrawal from the Kuomintang. A liberated soldier in a certain unit in North China reflected, \"When I first came, I thought that party members were supervising us, but now I understand that the Communist Party is completely different from the Kuomintang.\" Some said, \"Because I suffered from Kuomintang members over there (in the Kuomintang army), after coming here, I was scared all day when I saw there were also party members. Now I know that the Communist Party is much stricter with party members than with the masses!\" An Guo-cai, a liberated soldier from a certain regiment, praised when he saw the list of party members published, \"The Communist Party is really great. Over there (referring to the Kuomintang), party members are only announced at the theater for half-price tickets.\" Liu Zhong, a liberated soldier from a certain regiment, said, \"I've been in the army for more than a year and haven't become a party member yet. I will work hard in the future and strive to join the Communist Party.\" Some party members worried that the work would not be easy after the branch was opened up. Facts proved that it was just the opposite, because the party evaluation work was done well, not only educating the party members, but also educating the masses, and the masses trusted the party even more. The Kuomintang maintains the secrecy of its organization in the army and in society, and adopts secret surveillance methods against the masses. Our Communist Party should never and does not need to adopt this method, because this method is seriously divorced from the masses and causes suspicion and fear among the masses. It is completely wrong for some people to want to learn this bad style of the Kuomintang.\n\n　　In addition, after the evaluation of cadres, the soldiers generally reflected: \"The cadres have made progress, and we must also make progress. The opinions have been put forward, and our hearts are bright, and we are more motivated to work.\" Some cadres initially worried that letting soldiers evaluate cadres would lose their prestige. Facts have proved that as long as cadres take the initiative to lead this criticism, humbly listen to the correct criticisms of the masses, and make self-criticisms, and seriously improve their work and leadership style, their prestige will be enhanced, and the soldiers will love the cadres even more. After the democratic inspection of leadership in a certain unit in East China, the soldiers saw the cadres working with everyone and said, \"Actually, you don't need to participate. Just give us more ideas and help us educate us well.\" Some cadres worried that it would be difficult to lead the soldiers in this way. However, as long as democracy is under centralized leadership, not leaderless and disordered extreme democracy, such results will not occur. In a certain unit of the Northwest Liberation Army, the soldiers' representative at the cadre evaluation meeting said: \"Don't think that cadres will not be easy to be in the future, and don't dare to boldly lead us. We are an organized and disciplined army. After the problem is liberated, we should still handle things impartially.\" A certain unit in North China carried out a democratic movement in the Linfen campaign. After that, the cadres generally reflected, \"It's strange. There were often problems in fighting in the past, but this battle was more cruel, and everyone automatically completed the task. The troops are easier to lead.\"\n\n　　After the implementation of political democracy in the army, cadres, soldiers, and liberated soldiers all believe that it has a great educational effect on them, and their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm have been greatly improved. In the later period of the democratic movement in a certain unit in Central Plains, many battalion and company cadres said: \"It's really dangerous! I didn't know how many mistakes I had made before!\" Brigade and regimental cadres said: \"Our bureaucracy is really killing people. We don't know how many serious phenomena are coming!\" Zheng Xichun, the instructor of a certain unit in Northwest China, said after the soldiers' democratic evaluation, \"I was responsible for not completing the task last time. This time, I want to be in front with the soldiers. Even if I am the only one left, I will complete the task.\" Xing Zeru, who was demoted from platoon leader to soldier, also made his own plan to correct his mistakes. Yang Jihui, who was demoted from squad leader to soldier, said: \"We must resolutely complete the task and dedicate it to Chairman Mao. If it is street fighting, I guarantee to be the first to go to the roof.\" There are many similar examples. After the correct democratic movement, soldiers generally show that they are more eager to make progress, more obedient to orders, more brave in combat, and more consciously abide by discipline. The reason is that their political consciousness has been improved, the shortcomings of cadres have been corrected, and discipline has become their own discipline.\n\n　　After the democratic movement, the progress of liberated soldiers is even more significant. They feel that the implementation of democracy in the army is something they have never seen before. A liberated soldier in a certain unit in North China said: \"The Kuomintang is afraid of democracy. When soldiers see officers, if they don't agree, they are beaten with sticks and dealt with by military law. Offer opinions? Evaluate cadres? That's a dream! This time, evaluating cadres and evaluating party members is the first time I've ever seen it.\" Based on their own experience and comparison, they have increased their hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism. Some liberated soldiers in the Northwest troops tore up Kuomintang hats, hat badges, American-made supplies, and hidden armbands in public. They demanded not to be treated as prisoners of war and not to be called liberated soldiers. Some voluntarily exposed many hidden Kuomintang officers, spies, dissidents, and violators of discipline. The implementation of the democratic movement has enabled them to have a deeper understanding of the People's Liberation Army. Jiao Wendao, a liberated soldier in a certain unit in North China, reflected: \"When I first came, I heard that we were going to fight Shijiazhuang. I thought, isn't this a head-on collision? A few days later, I heard that Shijiazhuang had been captured. I thought, Shijiazhuang's fortifications are strong and there are many soldiers, how could it be liberated so quickly? I figured it out a few days ago. The best weapon of the Eighth Route Army is troop democracy, unity between officers and soldiers, and everyone coming up with ideas to fight. Why can't we win?\" They have already experienced that \"in the Kuomintang, you can't be a squad leader even if you are a soldier for two years. Here, as long as you do a good job, everyone will elect you.\" In some troops, after the democratic movement, liberated soldiers no longer look at the issue from the distinction between prisoners of war or new soldiers and old soldiers, but from a class perspective.\n\n　　2. After the implementation of military democracy, there are also many examples of the progress of the troops. As far back as the Panlong battle in Northwest China, a certain unit attacked a stronghold, but failed to capture it after two days of attack. Later, by adopting the suggestions of lower-level cadres and soldiers and changing the method of attack, they captured the stronghold in one fell swoop. In the Shijiazhuang battle, the capture of the Yunpan Mountain position was also due to the promotion of military democracy. From the start of the attack to the occupation, it took only ten minutes, with more than ten casualties, creating a model for siege warfare. More recently, in the Weixian siege battle in East China, the 5th Company of the 73rd Regiment adopted the opinions of the 2nd Squad when attacking the East City and quickly completed the task of blasting the city wall.\n\n　　The implementation of military democracy is not only very beneficial in combat and training, but also has a great educational effect on cadres. For example, Xu Shengtang, the company commander of a certain unit in Central Plains, only knew that he wanted the soldiers to charge in the past, but never considered how to charge. Recently, during the democratic inspection of command and leadership, he was initially unable to accept the criticisms of the soldiers and was very distressed. Later, he repeatedly considered the \"fourteen opinions on improving combat command\" given to him by the soldiers, and after the actual experience of the Xuchang battle, he realized that each soldier has his own certain talents and began to change his command method. Later, in the battle to capture Luoyang, his company was assigned the task of the first assault company. The soldiers more actively discussed their opinions with him, and the entire company worked together to successfully complete the arduous task of breaking through Luoyang. This made him realize that implementing military democracy makes soldiers easier to command. Another example is a regimental commander of a certain unit in North China who initially did not believe in the masses. After the Linfen battle, he actually experienced that military democracy helped him, so he himself became an active supporter of military democracy.\n\n　　3. After the implementation of economic democracy, due to the improvement of meals, the elimination of corruption and waste, the surrender of seized goods to the public, and the reasonable distribution of spoils of war, the mood of the soldiers immediately underwent a new change. For example, in a certain company in East China, sometimes there was not enough rice cooked, but the soldiers had no objections and did not want to cook a second time. The spoils of war seized by a certain unit can be distributed according to merit and need, promoting class friendship and giving more care to new soldiers and newly liberated soldiers. The soldiers said with satisfaction: \"If this is the case, there will be no objections. Why commit discipline?\" Therefore, the development of economic democracy has also helped maintain discipline in the army.\n\n　　However, democracy must be organized and led. Extreme democratization without organization and leadership is wrong. The democratic movement and the establishment of democratic life in the army must be carried out in an organized, orderly, and led manner. Democracy in the army is to improve the relationship between officers and soldiers, the relationship between the military and the people, and improve the combat effectiveness of the army. It is to improve and strengthen leadership and discipline in the army, not for democracy for the sake of democracy, let alone to weaken the legitimate power of army officers to command operations, manage troops, and solve problems. Some troops did not clarify this point at the beginning, so some tendencies of extreme democratization and tailism of abandoning leadership occurred in some troops in a very short period of time, so they could not obtain the due effect of the democratic movement and slackened the unity of the troops. However, these tendencies were quickly corrected under the instructions of the higher authorities and were not allowed to develop. When carrying out democratic movements and establishing democratic life in the army, all troops must prevent and correct these tendencies at any time. But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Do not be afraid to let go and lead the masses and implement necessary democracy that is harmless and beneficial within a certain range because these deviations may occur. We must recognize the great achievements of democracy in the army, dare to implement democracy, so as to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, improve leadership, promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, and achieve greater unity and greater improvement in combat effectiveness of the troops. This is a manifestation of being more responsible to the party and the people's cause.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. The Labor Congress unanimously passed a telegram to overseas Chinese on August 16, expressing deep sympathy for the persecution suffered by overseas Chinese under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and expressing deep concern for their patriotic movement and struggle to protect their vital interests. It called on them to join the people of the country in fighting to overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary group, in China. The original telegram is as follows:\n\nTo all overseas news agencies, overseas Chinese organizations, and all compatriots overseas:\n\nOur Sixth National Labor Congress of China has victoriously opened in Harbin, a city of the people. We have excitedly united the strength of the working class throughout the country, reviewed our experiences in the struggle in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and formulated future tasks to prepare for the upcoming victory of the national people's liberation cause. At the same time, we are thinking of our worker compatriots and all overseas compatriots with the utmost concern.\n\nThe patriotism and contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland are well known to the people of the whole country. Whether it was during the Xinhai Revolution, the Great Revolution, or the War of Resistance Against Japan, the overseas Chinese were enthusiastic supporters. During the War of Resistance, the surging patriotic salvation movement and donation movement by overseas Chinese in various places, especially overseas Chinese workers, and even the people's armed forces returning to China to participate in the War of Resistance; during the period when the Japanese invaders invaded Southeast Asia, many overseas Chinese directly participated in the local anti-Japanese struggle. That is to say, in the anti-Japanese war in China and Southeast Asia, our overseas compatriots have gloriously fulfilled their responsibility.\n\nLike the people at home, overseas compatriots also yearn for a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous. However, all domestic and foreign policies of the Kuomintang reactionary rule completely violate the wishes of the people of the whole country and overseas compatriots. For the benefit of the four major families, bureaucratic capitalists, large warlords, big landlords, and even big traitors, for the sake of national betrayal, dictatorship, and counter-revolutionary civil war, they are implementing the Qing Dynasty's policy of \"preferring to give to friendly countries rather than domestic slaves,\" kowtowing to American imperialism for money, and offering the sovereignty of China's sea, land, and air, inland river navigation rights, customs rights, development rights, and all kinds of sovereignty to American imperialism with both hands. They hired Japanese war criminals as senior consultants, and even used Japanese fascist armed forces to attack the Chinese people; before the Japanese peace conference was held and the peace treaty was signed, they flattered the will of American imperialism, sang praises of leniency towards Japan, and condoned the revival of Japanese imperialism. For the sake of the pockets of bureaucratic capitalists, they have already condoned the dumping of American goods in China, and now they are condoning the dumping of Japanese goods in China, causing unprecedented blows to Chinese national capital, massive unemployment of workers, hunger and bankruptcy of the broad masses of people, the flight of large numbers of compatriots overseas to seek a living, and the economic destruction of overseas Chinese businesses in various places, making it impossible for overseas Chinese businessmen to operate and overseas Chinese workers to find employment. In a word, the Kuomintang reactionary rule wants to turn China into a colony of American imperialists, plunging the people of the whole country and overseas compatriots into the abyss of slavery.\n\nThe crimes directly committed by the Kuomintang reactionary rule against overseas compatriots in various places overseas are even more well-known to you. They collude with imperialism and local reactionary rule to suppress your patriotic democratic movement and legal activities to protect your vital interests, close your schools and newspapers, arrest people or deport them. They even use various conspiracies to provoke unity within overseas Chinese and between overseas Chinese and local ethnic groups, and even achieve their goals by means of secret agents. All these facts show that as long as the rule of American imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary group, in China is not eliminated, the suffering of the broad masses of overseas compatriots cannot be alleviated.\n\nCompatriots, we deeply sympathize with your current situation, and we are equally deeply concerned about your patriotic movement and struggle to protect your vital interests. Now, thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, the strength of the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army has become unprecedentedly strong. The rule of the American imperialists and their running dog, the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary group, in China is increasingly heading towards extinction. No matter how much American imperialism helps, it cannot save the fate of its running dogs. The day of complete liberation for the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country is not far away, and the arrival of this day will also bring light to overseas compatriots. We sincerely believe that you will definitely be able to unite better in the future, and the overseas Chinese and the local ethnic groups will also unite better, so that Kuomintang secret agents will have no way to use their divisive tricks, strengthen the movement to fight for democracy and freedom and support the liberation of the motherland, and cooperate with the people at home to strive for the early realization of complete victory.\n\nAt present, the workers and people from all walks of life in the liberated areas are stepping up production with the highest enthusiasm, prospering the economy, and striving to support the People's Liberation War. At the same time, they sincerely welcome overseas workers and business people to come to the liberated areas to participate in industrial construction, and to work together with the people in the liberated areas to strive for the establishment of a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Sixth National Labor Congress\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　August 16\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 劳大号召海外华侨支援祖国解放运动\n\n1948-09-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　劳大号召海外华侨支援祖国解放运动\n    【新华社东北五日电】劳动大会于八月十六日一致通过致电海外华侨，对华侨在海外所遭受的国民党反动统治的迫害，表示深切的同情，对他们的爱国运动和保护切身利益的斗争，表示深切关怀，号召他们与国内人民一起为推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动集团在中国的统治而奋斗。原电如下：\n    海外各通讯社，各华侨团体，转各地全体侨胞公鉴：\n    我们中国第六次的劳动大会，胜利地在人民自己的城市哈尔滨开幕了。我们兴奋地团结了全国工人阶级的力量，检讨了我们在解放区和国民党统治区奋斗的经验，并规定了今后任务，准备迎接即将到来的全国人民解放事业的胜利。同时我们以最关切的心情，惦念着我各地华侨工友和全体侨胞。\n    华侨的爱国热忱和对祖国的贡献，是全国人民所熟知的。无论是辛亥革命时期，大革命时期，抗日时期，侨胞们都是热心的支持者。在抗战时期，各地侨胞特别是侨工，奔腾澎湃的救亡运动，捐献运动，甚至回国参加抗日的人民武装；在日寇侵入东南亚的时期，许多侨胞直接参加了当地的抗日斗争。这就是说，在中国和东南亚的抗日战争中，我海外侨胞光荣地尽了自己的一份责任。\n    侨胞们也同国内人民一样，渴望一个独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国。然而国民党反动统治的一切内政外交措施，却完全违背了全国人民和侨胞的愿望。他们为了四大家族、官僚资本家以及大军阀、大地主甚至大汉奸的利益，为了卖国独裁和反革命内战，竟执行着满清的“宁赠友邦勿予家奴”的政策，向美国帝国主义叩头借钱，把中国海、陆、空的主权，内河航行权，关税权，开发权，各种各样的主权都双手奉送给美帝国主义。他们把日本战犯聘为高级顾问，以至使用日本法西斯武装来进攻中国人民；在对日和会还未开，和约未订的时候，他们就奉承美帝国主义意旨，高唱对日宽大，纵容日本帝国主义的复活。为了官僚资本家的腰包，他们既已纵容了美帝货物在中国的倾销，现在又纵容了日货在中国倾销，使中国民族资本遭受空前打击，工人大量失业，使广大人民饥饿破产，使大量同胞逃亡海外求生，使各地侨胞在国内经营之经济大遭破坏，使侨商无业可营，侨工无业可就。总之一句话，国民党反动统治要把中国变为美帝国主义者的殖民地，使全国人民与各地侨胞更加陷入奴隶生活的深渊里。\n    国民党反动统治在海外各地所直接加于侨胞的罪行，更是你们所亲受熟知的。他们勾结帝国主义和当地反动统治，压迫你们的爱国民主运动和保护切身利益的合法活动，封闭你们的学校和报纸，逮捕人员或驱逐出境，他们更使用各种阴谋以挑拨侨胞内部及侨胞同当地民族间的团结，甚至以特务手段达到他们的目的。所有这些事实说明，美帝国主义者及其走狗国民党反动集团在中国的统治一天不消灭，广大侨胞的痛苦是无法解除的。\n    侨胞们，我们深切地同情你们的当前处境，我们同样深切地关心你们的爱国运动与保护自己切身利益的斗争。现在由于共产党的领导，中国人民和解放军的力量，已经空前地强大起来，美国帝国主义者及其走狗的国民党反革命集团在中国的统治则日益走向灭亡，不管美帝国主义怎样帮助，也无法挽救其走狗的覆没的命运。中国工人阶级和全国人民全面解放的日子已经不远了，而这个日子的到来，同时也就带来了侨胞们的光明。我们衷心地相信你们今后一定能够团结得更好，侨胞与当地民族之间也团结得更好，使国民党特务无从施展其挑拨离间的技俩，加强争民主、争自由的与支援祖国解放的运动，配合国内人民争取全面胜利的早日实现。\n    目前解放区工友和各界人士正以最高的热忱加紧生产，繁荣经济，努力支援人民解放战争，同时衷心地欢迎海外工友及工商界人士到解放区来参加工业建设，与解放区人民一起，为建立独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国而奋斗。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　第六次全国劳动大会\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　八月十六日"

    "content": "Northern Yue Third Prefectural Committee Instruction\n　　Organize Learning According to Level\n　　[Northern Yue Electric] The Third Prefectural Committee of the CCP Northern Yue District, summarizing the cadre study in the sub-district in July, the main gain was that study was linked to practice. Especially in studying \"Preface to Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder' (Reprinted)\" in conjunction with documents such as \"Opposing Liberalism,\" \"Strengthening Party Spirit Cultivation,\" and \"Gutian Conference,\" most cadres in various agencies reflected on themselves in connection with their personal situations. Many comrades wrote reflective notes. Some, in connection with the work of their own agencies, focused on carrying out the struggle against bad tendencies. For example, in its study, the Huaxing Company examined the lack of organization, discipline, and anarchic state in the thinking, work style, and work of the agency's individuals, and launched a ruthless ideological struggle against the shortcomings of comrades ×× and ×××, such as corruption, waste, liberalism, sectarianism, irresponsibility in work, and lack of discipline, and strictly enforced discipline. Through this practical education, the awareness and enthusiasm of all personnel were enhanced. The Huaxing Company's study was done relatively well, mainly because the leading cadres of the agency attached importance to study and personally led everyone. Generally, in the cadre study in the entire sub-district, there are still the following shortcomings: (1) The study requirements are generalized. People study everything without distinguishing levels. They simply follow the department and everyone studies together. As a result, those with high levels cannot further develop, while those with low levels feel very strenuous. (2) The study methods are too simple. Many departments use the method of one person reading and everyone listening, followed by discussion. As a result, due to the different levels of everyone, they cannot delve into it. (3) Individual departments are not active and are largely forced to study, emphasizing that they are too busy with work to study. Therefore, the Prefectural Committee hereby gives the following instructions for future study: (1) In the implementation of the unified study plan, each unit must put forward different requirements according to the different levels and standards of cadres. For example, when studying the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification in 1948, comrades who have done actual land reform work should link it with practice and conduct in-depth discussions. Cadres who have not done actual land reform work are required to understand the essential spirit of the document. (2) In terms of learning methods, self-study, explanation, and discussion should be combined. Those with poor comprehension ability can focus on explanation and discussion; those with high levels can focus on self-study and discussion. Therefore, the various agencies and departments should organize backbone groups to implement the method of taking the lead, or designate special personnel to help comrades with low levels to explain. (3) Overcome the erroneous views and understandings of \"It's okay not to study, but it's impossible not to work\" and \"Study conflicts with work.\" It is necessary to clearly understand: study is for work, and study is part of work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳三地委指示　根据程度组织学习\n\n1948-09-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳三地委指示\n  　根据程度组织学习\n    【北狱电】中共北狱区三地委，总结分区七月份干部学习，主要收获是学习与实际得到联系。特别在学习“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”时与“反对自由主义”、“增强党性锻炼”、“古田会议”等文件结合学习中，各机关干部大部联系个人，作了反省。不少同志写了反省笔记。有的联系本机关工作，有重点的开展了反不良倾向的斗争。如华兴公司在学习中，曾检查机关个人思想、作风、工作中的无组织无纪律无政府状态，对××、×××二同志贪污浪费、自由主义、闹宗派、工作不负责、缺乏纪律性等缺点，展开了无情的思想斗争，严格的执行了纪律。经过这一实际教育，提高了全体人员认识及积极性。华兴公司的学习搞得较好，主要原因是该机关的领导干部重视学习，并亲自带动了大家。总的检讨起来，在全分区干部学习中，尚存有以上缺点：（一）学习要求一般化，学习什么都学习什么，不分程度，单纯按部门，大家都在一起学习，结果程度高的不能进一步发挥，低的却感觉很费劲。（二）学习方法太单纯，很多部门都是用一人读，大家听，完了讨论的方法，结果由于大家程度不一，都钻不进去。（三）个别部门不积极，带有很大的被迫性，强调工作繁忙，学习不了。为此，地委对今后的学习特作如下指示：（一）在执行统一的学习计划中，各单位要根据干部的不同程度与水平，提出不同要求。如学习一九四八年中央关于土改与整党指示时，作过土改实际工作的同志，就要联系实际，作深入的讨论。没有作过土改实际工作的干部，要求他们能了解文件的精神实质。（二）在学习方法上要把自习、讲解、讨论结合起来进行。理解能力差的可以讲解讨论为主；程度高的可以自习讨论为主。因此，各机关部门，应组织骨干组，实行带头的办法，或指定专人帮助程度低的同志进行讲解。（三）克服“不学习可以，不作工作不成。”“学习与工作矛盾”的错误观点与认识，要明确认识：学习就是为了工作，学习就是工作的一部分。"

    "content": "(Taihang Telegram)\n\n　　In the inner-line plain siege and assault operations, the battle time is relatively long. The task of the stretcher-bearer civilians is to assist the troops in combat through a four-in-one action: carrying the wounded, digging fortifications, transporting earthwork tools, and delivering ammunition. Wherever the troops move, the civilians also move, living a combat life similar to that of the soldiers, but also decentralized. Therefore, if the civilians can be well organized and educated, it is of great importance to winning the war. In the long-distance participation in the war, the Taihang civilians carried out a \"three evaluations\" (evaluating cadres, evaluating themselves, evaluating others) and \"four records\" (recording completed tasks, recording mutual assistance, recording performance, recording discipline) movement. During the movement, each brigade continuously carried out ideological mobilization, organizational adjustments, and disciplinary rectification, improved organizational leadership, and improved the relationship between cadres and members. Because this movement combined improving the political consciousness of the masses (ideological transformation), improving leadership, strengthening organizational discipline, and improving military knowledge (including tactical improvement), the appearance of the civilians was completely renewed, and the efficiency of completing tasks was generally improved: two people's tasks were completed by one person, one night's task was completed in half a night, and the fact that minor injuries did not leave the front line appeared everywhere. The original regulation of five people per stretcher was later changed to four, three, and two people per stretcher. Each squad went from two stretchers to four. After the emergency order was issued, each team automatically organized stretcher assault teams to go to the front line with the troops to complete the task, highly demonstrating the people's enthusiasm for supporting the war. What are the main experiences in this?\n\n    Mobilization Equipment and Solving Production Problems\n\n    The mobilization work in the village before departure is the basic work to consolidate the civilian laborers. Any deceitful methods or failure to mobilize in depth, and an attitude of not seriously solving problems, is a lack of responsibility and is detrimental to the war. This time in the Jinzhong participation in the war, a combination of top-down mobilization and bottom-up guarantees was adopted, and the mobilization meeting was conducted through various systems, with party members taking the lead in promoting participation in the war. The village cadres and masses who stayed at home proposed to guarantee the production in the rear, so that the front and rear encouraged each other and dispelled the concerns of the participating civilians about production. Facts have proved that where the mobilization is more thorough and the problem of production participation and labor exchange is well resolved, the civilians there are consolidated. Conversely, although mobilization is constantly carried out during the expedition, the leadership is always forced to be in a passive position.\n\n    The participating civilians must be fully prepared in terms of equipment. For example, each company must have three large pots, one splitting axe, one saw, water buckets, knives, spoons and other utensils; each stretcher must also have a shovel, a pickaxe, and ropes, as well as personal shoes, etc., which are necessary for completing battlefield tasks.\n\n    To solve the rear production of the participating civilians, a fair burden-sharing and unified mutual assistance method was adopted. Each participating labor force was recorded as eight points per day (because they ate public grain), and one day was counted as one day, and the land was shared by the remaining labor force for mutual assistance. Mutual assistance was recorded according to the actual labor, and the accounts were settled uniformly after returning, to ensure that no one suffered losses. When the rear labor force is too scarce, women can be strongly mobilized to participate in production. In the district and village leadership, a unified plan and division of labor were adopted. Village-level production committees were used to promote it. A special person was assigned among the village cadres to arrange the lives of the participating civilians.\n\n    Establish Democratic Leadership and Develop Military Democracy\n\n    The civilian laborers are peasants who have undergone land reform and production movements. Some of them have undergone several major war participations, and some are militiamen and Communist Party members who have received political training and war education. They have a fairly high political consciousness and competitive spirit. They generally demand that their achievements be known to the masses in their villages and their families, and to the higher authorities. This is the political basis for realizing democratic leadership and developing military democracy. The movement began with the launch of the three evaluations, four records, and merit-making movement. An important item in the three evaluations is to examine the leadership and style of the cadres. At the beginning, the leaders gave the members courage and boldness, guaranteeing no retaliation, and letting the members boldly expose the problems of the leaders. It was found that some team leaders had inconsistent commands; some cadres could not understand the situation in time to explain to the members, reducing fear; some cadres beat people, lived a special life, and some were afraid of death or had tailism representing backward opinions and destructive disciplinary phenomena. After examination and discussion, the opinions of the masses were concentrated, the cadres were transformed, and the leadership was strengthened. The good platoon leaders recognized by the masses were promoted to company commanders. In the democratic movement, it is necessary to correct two deviations in a timely manner: one is that some cadres are afraid of democracy and afraid of criticism, thinking that this will make it impossible to lead, that military affairs cannot be democratic, and that democracy cannot implement orders; the other is that the members find fault with the cadres, nitpicking, and extreme democracy. For example, hiding during air raids was also considered a bad attitude. The leadership carried out correct democratic education based on the specific situation and the correct opinions of the masses, promoted the correct democratic style, and overcame commandism and tailism.\n\n    The other two contents of the three evaluations are evaluating oneself and evaluating others. This is examined from the perspective of completing tasks and obeying leadership. Some members said: \"The cadres force us to hide from the planes for our own good, how can we say they are wrong?\" The leadership promoted this consciousness of everyone and strengthened the members' organization and discipline, so that the movement shifted from striving for individual models to striving for collective models, so the work effect was increased to 100% to 300%. For example, when transporting door panels, one team could transport 300 pieces overnight at the beginning, but at this time, 600 pieces could be transported in the middle of the night.\n\n    In the evaluation and recording, it is necessary to grasp the evaluation and recording standards and the principle of criticism and self-criticism: that is, being able to complete tasks, abide by discipline, and help each other (including caring for the wounded, not saying strange things, and not complaining about fatigue, etc.). These standards themselves combine commendation and merit-making with criticism, which is different from the past's pure commendation, only saying good things and not saying bad things, but evaluating good and bad merits and demerits together to promote mutual progress. Coupled with the leadership's self-reporting and public discussion, the correctness of the evaluation and recording is further guaranteed.\n\n    For heavy work such as transporting equipment, it is necessary to add evaluation of strength and weight, otherwise, if only evaluated from the numbers, some people have great strength and carry more, and those with less strength will not be praised even if they do their best, which will weaken their energy.\n\n    The evaluation and recording method should be that each squad leader accepts each person's work report and opinions every day or after a task is completed, laying the foundation for the overall evaluation. The results of the evaluation and recording must be submitted to the company or brigade for review and approval. If there are any inappropriate ones, a re-evaluation will be proposed, even repeated evaluations. At the conclusion of the movement, all the good and bad merits and demerits evaluated in each section are added up (good and bad cannot be offset) for a final evaluation. In addition to awarding the model workers, everyone's merits should be brought back. For erroneous behaviors such as desertion, it must also be filled in and brought back. If one has a new understanding of one's shortcomings after democratic discussion, it can be omitted. This is of great educational significance.\n\n    Several Issues in the Political Work of Civilian Laborers\n\n    First, to make the members change from cowardly to brave, the cadres must take the lead in supporting and encouraging them and commanding calmly. The 3rd Company of the 6th Brigade had to transport rails to the artillery position, and they had to pass through an open area. The deputy battalion commander and the deputy company commander first carried one rail over, and other members followed suit under this influence. No one retreated even when bullets hit the rails. In a stretcher activity of a detachment of the 4th Company of the 2nd Brigade, the enemy counterattacked and surrounded from the flanks. The enemy's bombs exploded on the shelter. The members were afraid and wanted to run away. The squad leader Yuan Shisheng judged the situation and immediately explained to everyone: \"The troops are still in front, they will eliminate the enemy on our position, don't move around, listen to the command!\" The members were not confused, and there were no casualties. Secondly, on-the-spot military knowledge education should be carried out on the battlefield. When the 2nd Brigade in Changzhi discovered enemy aircraft, it conducted air defense education to enable members to identify bombers, fighters, and transport aircraft, and told them the characteristics of various aircraft and how to avoid them, and how to move beyond the danger zone. With military knowledge, the members gradually freed themselves from fear. The third is to improve political awareness. Combine the evaluation of casualties to oppose fear of death. When the × Company of the 2nd Brigade evaluated the casualties, they found the cause of the casualties: they did not know to disperse when the shells came, and many people squeezed around, not listening to the command. After repeated discussions, it got better later.\n\n    Second, on the issue of consciously abiding by battlefield discipline, mass discipline, and urban discipline. Before the start of the campaign, special discipline and policy education must be carried out to enlighten everyone to cherish the liberated areas and build the political awareness of the liberated areas. In action, discipline inspection must be organized. Those who perform well should be commended and encouraged, and those who violate policies and disciplines should be criticized and corrected. Those who conceal violations of policies and disciplines and those who do not change after education should be given disciplinary sanctions. Some people do not report when they see violations of discipline, or they do not care when they see enemy-abandoned machine guns. This is a liberal attitude of not cherishing revolutionary weapons and should be educated and corrected in a timely manner.\n\n    Third, the issue of setting up branches among the participating civilians to strengthen the leadership of the party. Some places have not paid attention to this work, causing party members to lose leadership and weakening the role of the party. For example, when a certain brigade first selected models, more than 80 people were selected, but only five were party members. After the branch checked, the party members played an active role. When the models were selected for the second time, there were more than 20 party members, accounting for 40% of all party members in the branch. The task of the party branch of the civilian militia company should be to unite and consolidate the civilian militia, ensure the completion of the task, ensure the implementation of discipline, publicize the party's policies, review party members during the participation in the war, educate and transform party members, and become a political work trust. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a unified party organization such as the Party Committee and the General Branch. And strengthen the party's leadership institutions, so that the civilians can exert greater combat effectiveness under the sound unitary leadership.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 带领民工参战的几点经验\n\n1948-09-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　带领民工参战的几点经验\n    在内线的平原围城攻坚作战中，战役时间较长。担架民工的任务，由抬伤员到挖工事，运土工作业器材，送弹药，以四位一体的动作协助部队作战。部队运动到哪里，民工也运动到哪里，过着同战士一样的但又是分散的战斗生活。因此民工能组织和教育的好，对争取战争胜利是有极大关系的。太行民工在远征参战中，开展了三评（评干部、评自己、评别人）、四记（记完成任务、记互助、记表现、记纪律）运动。在运动过程中，各大队不断进行思想动员、组织调整和纪律整顿，健全了组织领导，改善了干部与队员的关系。由于这一运动是把提高群众政治觉悟（思想改造）、改进领导、加强组织性纪律性及提高军事常识（战术改进在内）三者结合进行的，因之民工面貌为之一新，完成任务的效率普遍提高：二人任务一人完成，一夜任务半夜完成，轻伤不下火线的事实，到处出现。原来规定五人一付担架，以后变成四人、三人、二人一付。每班由两付而变成四付。紧急命令下达后，各队自动组织担架突击队，与部队一起到前线去完成任务，高度表现出人民对支援战争的热情。在这当中有哪些主要经验呢？\n    动员装备及解决生产问题\n    出发前在村的动员工作，是巩固民工的基础工作。任何哄骗方式或不深入动员，不认真解决问题的态度，都是缺乏责任心，对战争不利的。此次晋中参战，采取了自上而下的动员与自下而上的保证配合，且经过各系统的动员会，党员带头推动参战。留在家的村干党员与群众，提出保证后方生产，这样前后方互相鼓舞，解除了参战民工对生产的顾虑。事实证明，那里动员比较彻底，对生产参战变工问题解决得好，那里的民工就巩固。反之，虽在出征中不断动员，领导上总是被迫处于被动地位。\n    参战民工在装备上，必须有充分准备。如每一个中队要有大锅三口，劈斧一把，锯子一把，水桶、刀、杓子等用具；每付担架又要有一把洋锹，一把洋镐与绳索，以及个人的鞋子等，都是在完成战场任务时必需的。\n    解决参战民工后方生产，采取了公平负担，统一助耕的办法。每个参战劳力一天按八分记工（因吃的是公粮），有一天算一天，地由留在家的劳力一负担助耕。助耕按实际劳力记工，回来后统一算帐，保证谁也不吃亏。后方劳力太缺乏时，可以大力动员妇女参加生产。在区村领导上，采取了统一计划，分工负责。运用村级生产委员进行推动。村干部中设专人负责按排参战民工的生活。\n    树立民主领导开展军事民主\n    民工是经过了土改与生产运动的农民，其中有一部分经过几次较大的参战锻炼，一部分是受过政治训练和战争教育的民兵和共产党员，有相当高的政治觉悟与竞胜心，普遍要求把自己的成绩让自己村群众和家里人知道，让上级知道。这就是实现民主领导和开展军事民主的政治基础。运动开始，是从开展三评四记立功运动搞起的。三评中重要一项，即是检查干部的领导和作风。开始时，领导上即给队员作主壮胆，保证不报复，让队员大胆揭发领导上的问题，检查出有的队领导指挥不一致；有的干部不能及时了解情况，给队员解释，减少恐惧心理，还吓唬民工，越吓唬越骇怕；有的干部打人，生活特殊，有的怕死或有代表落后意见的尾巴主义及破坏纪律现象等。经过检查讨论，集中群众意见，改造干部，加强了领导，群众公认的好排长提拔起来当了连长。民主运动中必须及时纠正两个偏向：一是某些干部怕民主，怕提意见，以为这样便没法领导，要军事即不能民主，要民主就不能执行命令；一是队员对干部没错找错，吹毛求疵，极端民主。如把躲飞机时干部命令隐敝也算作态度不好等。领导上根据具体情况及群众中的正确意见，进行了正确的民主教育，发扬了正确的民主作风，克服了命令主义和尾巴主义。\n    三评的另两个内容是评自己，评别人。这是从完成任务与服从领导来检查的。有的队员说：“干部逼住叫咱躲飞机，是为了咱，这还能说人家不对？”领导上发扬了大家的这种自觉性，加强了队员的组织性和纪律性，使运动从争取个人模范转向争取集体模范，因而工作效果提高到百分之一百至三百。例如运门板，开始时一个队一夜运三百块，这时半夜即可运六百块。\n    评记中要掌握评记标准及批评与自我批评的原则：即能完成任务，遵守纪律，互助友爱（包括爱护伤员，不说怪话，疲劳不埋怨等）。这些标准的本身，就是表模立功与批评相结合，不同于过去的单纯表功，光说好不说坏，而是好坏功过一起评，相互推动进步。加上有领导的自报公议，就更保证了评记的正确进行。\n    运送器材等重活，必须加上评力评斤秤，否则只从数字上评，有些人力气大，扛运得多，力小的出尽力气也得不到表扬，即会泄劲。\n    评记方法，应是每班每天或一个任务完了之后，由各班组长接受各个人的工作报告及意见，给总评打下基础。评记的结果，必须交中队或大队审查批准。有不合适的就提出复评，甚至反复的评。到运动总结时，将各段所评的好坏功过都加起来（好坏不能抵消）进行总评鉴定。除发奖给模范者外，应该把各个人的功劳都带回去。对于开小差等错误行为，也必须填上带回。如果对自己毛病经过民主讨论有了新认识，即可不填。这样教育意义很大。\n    民工政治工作中几个问题\n    第一，要使队员由懦怯变为勇敢，首先要求干部带头撑腰壮胆，沉着指挥。六大队三连给炮兵阵地运道轨，必须通过一段开阔地带。副大队长和副连长首先抬上一根过去了，其他队员便在这种影响下也跟了上去。子弹打到道轨上也没人后退。二大队四中队一个分队的担架一次随营活动，敌人反扑，从侧面包围上来，敌人的炸弹就在避弹洞上爆炸；队员恐惧，想逃跑，分队长袁士生判断了情况，马上给大家解释：“部队还在前边，会把敌人消灭在我们的阵地上，不要乱动，听指挥！”队员没有混乱，也没有伤亡，其次，要在战场上进行实地军事常识教育。长治二大队发现敌机时，便进行防空教育，使队员识辨轰炸机或战斗机、运输机，告诉以各种飞机的特点和如何躲避、超过危险圈等办法。队员有了军事知识，便逐渐从恐惧里解放出来。再次是提高政治觉悟。结合评定伤亡，反对怕死。二大队×中队在评定伤亡时，找出了伤亡原因、是炮弹打过来不知道分散，许多人乱挤，不听指挥。经过反复讨论，以后便好了。\n    第二，关于自觉遵守战场纪律、群众纪律及城市纪律问题。战役开始前，要专门进行纪律与政策教育，启发大家爱护解放区，建设解放区的政治觉悟。行动中，必须组织纪律检查。执行好的应表扬鼓励，违犯政策与纪律的要批评纠正。对于违犯政策纪律隐瞒不报和经教育不改者，应给以纪律处分。有的看到破坏纪律不报告，或看见敌人遗弃机枪也不管，这是对革命武器不爱护的自由主义态度，也应及时教育纠正。\n    第三，参战民工中设立支部，加强党的领导问题。有的地方因没重视这一工作，使党员失去领导，减弱了党的作用。如某大队第一次评选模范时，选出八十余名，只有五个党员。经过支部检查，党员发挥了积极性。第二次选模范时，即有党员二十余名，占全支部党员百分之四十。民工中队支部工作的任务，应是团结巩固民工，保证任务完成，保证执行纪律，宣传党的政策，在参战中审查党员，教育改造党员，并成为政治工作的依托。因此必须设立党的统一组织为党委会、总支部等。并强化党的领导机构，使民工在健全的一元化领导下发挥更大的战斗力。　\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（太行电）"

    "content": "Restoring Organization, Establishing Systems\n　　Laishui Cadre Study Achieves Results\n    [Beiyue Telegram] Since the Laishui Party member cadres' study expansion meeting in May, the county party committee has equipped each district committee with two propaganda committee members who have strong working abilities and higher levels of education. One person is responsible for branch education, and the other specializes in leading cadre study and communication work. Regarding cadre study, the county party committee promptly drafts specific study plans based on the current central work and important documents published by the Party Central Committee, determining different study centers for different periods. Over the months of June and July, the following achievements have been made: restoring the study organization and establishing a study system. All units have universally restored the organization of the propaganda and education committee since June. Based on the level of education and work area, study groups were organized (cadres going to the countryside used work groups as study groups). Everyone fully subscribed to study notebooks, and the group leader checked the notes at any time. In addition to adhering to two hours of study every day, four days were set aside each month as study days. Two centralized sessions are held, each lasting two days, for collective study and research on Party policies. For example, after studying documents such as \"Reprint of the Preface to Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder',\" Comrade Yang Tian, ​​educational instructor of the Sixth District, examined himself and said: \"When I returned from supporting the front, I didn't ask for leave, and I went home halfway. I must correct this kind of disorganized and undisciplined behavior in the future.\" Assistant Zhao of the Seventh District said: \"When I went to Nankuan Village to work in the countryside, the masses urgently asked me to solve their problems. But I was too lazy and secretly came back early in the morning. This is the biggest mistake of not caring about the masses and being divorced from the masses.\" After the county's cadre expansion meeting, the Fifth District formally established a propaganda and education committee and set up a bulletin board question-and-answer column to guide everyone's study. The First District established a club, driven by the propaganda section to promote comprehensive study. The Seventh District even specially cleaned up a room as a study room. Every morning and on study days, all cadres come to the study room to collectively study and research documents, overcoming the previous free-flowing phenomenon. In July, everyone's enthusiasm for study was even higher. Some cadres of the county committee didn't even take a nap in order to study the documents. They were reluctant to put down the documents even when the meal bell rang in the morning. During this period, all in-service cadres further familiarized themselves with the Party's policies, and the confused ideas of the past, such as the old cadres not being bold enough in their work, and the new cadres being afraid of setbacks, afraid of transfers, and unwilling to work, have been largely resolved. Therefore, despite the cadres' illnesses and frequent transfers, they still led the masses to complete the arduous tasks of production, disaster relief, and supporting the front lines. Moreover, most worker-peasant cadres unanimously reflected: \"Since we have grasped the study firmly, we feel that there are more methods in our work.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 恢复组织，建立制度　涞水干部学习获成绩\n\n1948-09-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　恢复组织，建立制度\n  　涞水干部学习获成绩\n    【北狱电】涞水党员干部学习，自五月扩干会后，县委即对各区分委配备了两个工作能力较强，文化程度较高的宣传委员。一人负责支部教育，一人专门领导干部学习和通讯工作。关于干部学习方面，根据当前的中心工作，和党中央发表的重要文件，由县委及时的拟出具体的学习计划，不同时期确定不同的学习中心，六、七两月来，获得以下成绩：恢复了学习组织，建立起学习制度。各单位从六月份都普遍的恢复了宣教委员会的组织。根据程度和工作地区，组织了学习小组。（下乡干部以工作组为学习小组）每人全订了学习笔记本，由组长随时检查笔记，除每天坚持两小时学习外，每月还抽出四天时间，作为学习日。集中两次，每次学习两天。集体学习和研究党的政策。如学了“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”等文件后，六区教导员杨田同志检查自己说：“我支前回来，没请假，半路上就回家去了，这种无组织无纪律的行为，今后一定要改正。”七区赵助理员说着：“到南款村下乡，群众迫切要求我给他们解决问题。可是我嫌麻烦，就起早儿偷着回来了。这是不关心群众，脱离群众的最大错误。”五区从县扩干会后，就正式成立了宣教委员会，设立了墙报问答栏等领导大家学习。一区则成立了俱乐部，由宣传股推动全面学习。七区更专门收拾一间房子为学习室，每天早晨和学习日，全体干部一律到学习室来集体学习，研究文件。克服了以往的自流现象。在七月份中，大家的学习情绪更高涨了，县委会有的干部，为了研究文件，连午觉都不睡。早晨打吃饭钟还舍不得放下文件。这一期间，全体在职干部，进一步熟悉了党的政策，过去旧干部工作不大胆，新干部怕碰钉子，怕调动，不愿工作等混乱思想，已大体上解除。因而在干部多病和频繁的调动下，仍然领导群众完成了生产渡荒和支援前线的艰巨任务。而且大部工农干部，一致反映：“自从抓紧了学习，觉着工作上办法也多了。”"

    "content": "Good Way to Promote Learning Among On-the-Job Cadres\n  　Yan'an Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department\n  　Holds Newspaper Reading Test\nXinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th—The Yan'an Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region held a newspaper reading test on the 13th of last month. The results proved that this is an important and effective method to promote learning among on-the-job cadres, and it is worthy of vigorous promotion and popularization. The subjects of the Yan'an Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department's test were county party secretaries, county magistrates, and district-level cadres who came to Yan'an for meetings. The test questions totaled twenty, all selected from the July and August issues of the *Masses Daily*, including the Party's policy instructions, important news from Yan'an Prefecture, and major events in the Liberated Areas, the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and internationally. The test results: out of a total of 103 people, only 29 passed, and 74 failed. The number of those who failed exceeded three-quarters.\n\n　　The test shows that some departments and some cadres are very serious about reading and studying the Party newspaper, but most cadres (especially economic and financial cadres) and leading comrades in some counties have a very serious problem of not reading the Party newspaper seriously or regularly. The answers from 57 district party and government cadres and leading comrades from various counties reveal the following serious problems: First, not enough importance and research is given to the Party's policies and instructions from higher authorities. The fifth item of the \"May 1st\" Labor Day slogans issued by the Party Central Committee, namely, \"All democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all enlightened people should promptly convene a political consultative conference to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's congress to form a democratic coalition government,\" has won the support of people from all democratic parties across the country. They sent telegrams to Chairman Mao, and the newspaper also published it in large print, but as many as 24 people could not answer the main content of the slogan. Only fourteen people answered correctly about the basic characteristics of the military situation in the second year of the Liberation War and the five important tasks in the third year, twenty-six people did not answer completely, and seventeen people answered completely wrong or left it blank. After the summary of the two-year Liberation War was published in the newspaper, the Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department notified all localities under its jurisdiction to require every cadre to memorize its main contents and figures so as to publicize it to the masses anytime and anywhere. The test results showed that twenty-one people did not answer completely or answered incorrectly regarding the names of the five major liberated areas and the current total population. As for the number of enemies annihilated in the past two years, forty-two people (seventeen in each county) also did not answer completely or left it blank. The news that the Border Government instructed all counties to gradually restore schools and social education was published on the front page of the newspaper, but twenty-three people (including nine leading comrades from various counties) did not know about the \"government-subsidized, people-run\" policy for restoring primary schools. Secondly, local news is ignored. Some comrades usually only read the war news from the Liberated Areas and major international events, and take a indifferent attitude towards the news from the Border Region that has practical guiding significance for their work. For example, Liu Jianzhang's three methods of combining wartime transport and production, which was published on the front page of the August 10th newspaper, was not known to forty-seven people. Third, some people said, \"I have a bad memory, and I can't remember it after reading it once.\" But the main reason is that they don't pay enough attention to the newspaper ideologically, and they haven't developed the habit of reading it regularly. In addition, there are shortcomings in the method of reading the newspaper, and they can't grasp the important news published in the newspaper every day, use their brains, and think about how to connect it with their work. It just flows through like \"water off a duck's back.\" In this way, some common sense news that has appeared repeatedly in the newspaper is ignored, and naturally \"can't remember.\" For example, generally comrades say that they like war news, but they don't look at the map, don't distinguish between east, west, north, and south, and answer that Xiangyang in Hubei is in \"Anhui\" or \"Shandong\" province, Shijiazhuang in Hebei is in \"Northeast,\" and the Sixth National Labor Congress held in Harbin is in \"Kaifeng.\" The leaders of the Italian and Japanese Communist Parties were assassinated by the reactionaries, and Chairman Mao sent telegrams to express his condolences. Nearly half of the people \"can't remember\" their names. When asked which countries the European Intelligence Bureau was composed of, some even filled in five countries including China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India. In particular, the years in which our Party and our army were founded, which were commemorated not long ago, and which were also introduced in the newspapers, were \"not remembered\" by four people (Party members) for the former and eleven people for the latter.\n\n　　This test has played a role in awakening and promoting comrades who usually do not pay attention to reading newspapers. Now they generally pay more attention to reading newspapers, and some have begun to take current affairs notes. In order to maintain this enthusiasm, the Prefectural Party Committee Propaganda Department has issued instructions based on the experience of this test: 1. In coordination with document study, stipulate that one morning of study time per week should be used to discuss current events; 2. In the future, district-level cadres will be given irregular tests; 3. After a certain period of time, send questions by letter to the leading comrades of each county, asking them about their learning situation and opinions on important news articles related to their work published in the newspaper, so as to help them develop the habit of reading newspapers, and through them, urge county and district cadres to pay attention to reading Party newspapers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 推动在职干部学习的好办法　延属地委宣传部　举行读报测验\n\n1948-09-08\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　推动在职干部学习的好办法\n  　延属地委宣传部\n  　举行读报测验\n    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边区延属地委宣传部于上月十三日举行了一次读报测验，结果证明这是推动在职干部学习的重要有效办法之一，值得大大提倡推广。延属地委宣传部此次测验对象是来延开会之县委书记、县长和分区级干部。测验题共二十条，都是从七月份八月份群众日报上选择的，包括党的政策指示，延属重要消息及解放区、国民党统治区和国际主要大事。测验结果：合计一百零三人，及格的仅二十九人，不及格的七十四人。不及格的超过了四分之三。\n    从测验中可看出，一部分机关部门和一部分干部对党报的阅读研究还很认真，但大部分干部（特别是财经干部）和一些县的领导同志，在阅读党报中，不认真不经常的现象非常严重。从分区党政干部和各县领导同志五十七人的答案里可以看出下面几个严重问题：首先是重视与研究党的政策和上级指示不够。党中央颁发的“五一”劳动节口号第五项即“各民主党派、各人民团体、各社会贤达迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府。”一条，曾获得全国人民各民主党派人士的拥护，他们打了电报给毛主席，报纸也用大字登了出来，但竟有二十四人答不出该项口号的主要内容。解放战争第二年军事情况的基本特点和第三年的五个重要任务，只有十四人答对，二十六人答不完全，十七人全错或空白。两年解放战争的总结在报上发表后，地委宣传部曾通知所属各地，要每个干部熟记其主要内容和数字，以便随时随地向群众宣传。测验结果，五大解放区的名称和现有人口总数，有二十一人答得不完全或答错误。而两年来歼敌数目则有四十二人（各县十七人）也答得不完全或空白。边府指示各县逐渐恢复学校和社会教育工作的新闻，登在报纸第一版上，其中恢复初小的“民办公助”方针，还有二十三人（其中各县领导同志九人）不知道。其次是漠视地方新闻。若干同志平时只看解放区战讯和国际上的重大事件，对工作有实际指导意义的边区消息，采取漠不关心的态度。如八月十日报纸一版头条登载刘建章同志创造战勤运输和生产相结合的三个办法，就有四十七人不清楚。第三、有些人说：“记性不好，看过一遍记不住。”但主要是由于思想上对报纸不够重视，未养成经常阅读的习惯，再加上读报方法有缺点，不能抓住每天报上登载的重要消息，动动脑筋，和自己的工作连系起来想一想。只是“水过鸭背”似的流过去，这样，一些再三在报纸上出现过的新闻常识也熟视无睹，自然“记不住”。比如一般同志都说爱好战讯，但是不看地图，不分东南西北，把湖北的襄阳答在“安徽”或“山东”省，河北的石家庄答在“东北”，在哈尔滨开幕的第六次全国劳动大会答在“开封”，意大利和日本共产党的领袖曾被反动派阴谋刺伤，毛主席打了电报去慰问，近半数的人却“记不住”他们的名字。欧洲情报局是那些国家共产党组成的，竟然答项中有填中、英、美、荷、印等五国参加的。特别是我党和我军成立的年份，才开过纪念会不久，报纸也有介绍，前者有四人（党员）后者有十一人“记不住”了。\n    这次测验，对于平时不注意看报的同志，起了惊醒和推动的作用，现在他们已经普遍地比较注意看报了，有的已开始做时事笔记。地委宣传部为使这种热情坚持下去，特根据这次测验经验，发出指示：一、配合文件学习，规定每周要以一个早上的学习时间漫谈时事；二、今后分区级干部举行不定期测验；三、经若干时日，函寄题目给各县领导同志，询问他们对于报上登载与工作有关的重要消息文章的学习情况和意见，以帮助他们养成看报习惯，经过他们再督促县区干部重视阅读党报。"

    "content": "Column: Inquiries and Replies\n\nTo the Editor:\n    Qian Li, in the Second District of Shouzhang, is an extremely poor village with no landlords or rich peasants. During the re-examination, in order to mobilize the masses, five middle-peasant households were struggled against. None were driven out of their homes, and their lives are not difficult. Should they be compensated in this case? If they are to be compensated, the village has no fruits of labor, and if we ask the poor peasants to take them out again, they won't agree (nor will the village cadres). They say, \"This is more property than our poor peasant families have!\" Is it okay not to compensate them?\n    Also: During the re-examination last year, Wang Zhencai, a middle peasant from Mengzhuang, in the Third District of Shouzhang, had all his farm tools and property confiscated, including an ox he was raising. On a certain day in June, the village cadres wanted to sell two willow trees on his ancestral grave, and then buy an ox to compensate him. They discussed it with Zhencai, but he was unwilling. Is it okay for the village cadres to force the sale?\n                                                                                                                      Wang Zhenshan\n\n    Answer: 1. As mentioned in the letter, in poor villages like Li Village, where there are no landlords or old-fashioned rich peasants, it is wrong to struggle against middle peasants in order to mobilize the masses. Such villages, having no landlords or rich peasants, should not engage in struggle. If some middle peasants have land exceeding the village's average landholding by a factor of one, an adjustment can be made on a truly voluntary basis for the middle peasant (not exceeding one-fourth of their land). At the same time, the higher-level government should vigorously support mass production and solve the farmers' difficulties. The five middle-peasant households that have already been wrongly struggled against should first be acknowledged as having been wronged, and the wrongly assigned class status should be publicly corrected. As for compensation, the solution can be discussed and resolved by all the villagers. If, as the letter says, \"none were driven out of their homes, and their lives are not difficult,\" and the village has no fruits of labor, and the wrongly struggled households can agree not to be compensated or to be compensated less, then no compensation or less compensation can be given. If the wrongful struggle is severe and the individual cannot maintain production and livelihood, and the wrongly struggled household is indeed a middle peasant who started from labor, then every effort should be made to compensate them. It would be wrong to shelve the matter and not resolve it because the masses and village cadres do not understand. However, in this work, we must be careful not to discourage the poor and hired peasants. On the contrary, we should rely closely on the poor and hired peasants to carry out compensation. We must first educate the poor and hired peasants, explaining repeatedly so that they understand the positive significance of correcting deviations, which is to develop production, and this is also beneficial to the poor and hired peasants. And from analyzing the causes of the mistakes and the methods of correction, we can improve the class consciousness of cadres and the masses, so that they can recognize what is the policy of our party, what is the deviation in execution, and finally achieve the goal of uniting all strata to develop production.\n    2. Infringing on the interests of middle peasants is not permitted by policy. Compensating wrongly struggled middle peasants is to strengthen unity and develop production, so deviations should be corrected. If Wang Zhencai is indeed a middle peasant who started from labor, the village cadres should immediately use other reasonable methods to compensate for his losses. Selling the trees on Wang Zhencai's grave and then buying an ox to compensate him for his losses is not appropriate.\n                                                                                                                                             —Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 没有地富的穷村也不应斗争中农\n王振山\n1948-09-08\n第2版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　没有地富的穷村也不应斗争中农编辑同志：\n    寿张二区前李，是个极贫苦的村子，没有地主富农，复查时为了发动群众，斗了五家中农，都没扫地出门，生活也不困难，象这样是否还补偿他呢？若要补偿吧，村里又没有果实，再叫贫农拿出来，他们都不通（村干也不通），他们说：“这比咱贫农的家业还大哩！”不补偿是否行呢？\n    又：寿张三区孟庄中农王振才在去年复查时，他的各样农具财产都被没收啦，喂着一头牛也没收啦。六月某日，村干要卖他老坟上的两棵柳树，然后再买牛补偿他，与振才商量，他不愿意，村干强迫卖了是否能行？\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王振山\n    答：一、如来信所说李村那样没有地主、旧式富农的穷苦村，为了发动群众而斗争中农是错误的。这样的村子，既没有地主富农，就不应实行斗争，如果有的中农土地数超过全村土地平均数一倍上下者，在中农真正自愿的条件下，可调剂一部（以不超过其土地的四分之一为限）。同时上级政府应大力扶助群众生产，解决农民的困难。目前已经错斗了五户中农，首先应向其承认错误，错订的成份应公开地加以订正。至于补偿办法，可由全村农民商讨解决，如确如来信所说“都未扫地出门，生活也不困难”，村中又没有了果实，而错斗户也能同意不补或少补，可以不补或少补。如错斗严重，其本人不能维持生产与生活，而错斗户又确系劳动起家的中农，则应尽量设法补偿，如因群众村干思想不通而搁下不予解决则是错误的。但在这一工作中，必须注意不要给贫雇农泼冷水，相反地应该紧紧依靠贫雇进行补偿，必须首先在贫雇农中进行教育，反复解释，使他们认识到纠偏的积极意义，是为了发展生产，这样对贫雇农也是有好处的。并从分析错误原因及纠正办法中，提高干部与群众的阶级觉悟，使他们认清什么是我党的政策，什么是执行中的偏向，最后达到团结各阶层发展生产的目的。\n    二、侵犯中农利益是政策所不允许的。补偿错斗中农，是为了加强团结发展生产，所以有了偏向就应该纠正，如王振才确系劳动起家的中农，该村干部应即另行以其他合理办法，补偿他的损失。如卖了王振才坟上的树，再买牛补偿其本人损失的办法，是不妥当的。　　　　　　\n　　　　　　　　——编者"

When the radio broadcast the sad news on the evening of the 31st, sorrow enveloped the entire country. Upon hearing the news, many people were moved to tears. Black-bordered mourning flags were raised or flown at half-mast across the country to express grief. Newspapers devoted entire pages to publishing the obituary of Zhdanov and condolences from across the country and around the world. That evening, workers and farmers in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Kalinin, Gorky, and other places held memorial services. The depth of the grief of the people of Leningrad cannot be expressed in words. During the most difficult years of the anti-fascist war, under the leadership of Zhdanov, they fought to the death against the German invaders who besieged Leningrad and repelled the enemy. Everything here reminds people of Zhdanov's inexhaustible Bolshevik energy and historically significant contributions. In Gorky City, where Zhdanov led for more than ten years, workers at memorial services recalled Zhdanov's past work, pointing out that many districts were built under his guidance, and that he personally laid the first cornerstone of the Molotov Automobile Factory. At a memorial service at the \"Red Proletarian\" factory in Moscow, retired soldier and worker Dmitry Shmief stated in his speech: \"All the workers of our factory and the entire working class must compensate for this loss. We must unite more closely around the Party and Comrade Stalin.\" Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, wrote in Pravda that the death of Zhdanov was a loss to the Soviet intellectual community and the world's progressive cultural circles, who had lost an outstanding theorist of the new Soviet culture. Soviet scientists deeply felt the grief. Zhdanov's understanding of the spirit of Soviet science as a whole and the characteristics of its various departments was particularly clear. Our scientists and scientific institutions have received instructions, suggestions, and the most thorough discussions from Zhdanov on all important principles related to the essence and organization of science. It is the responsibility of our scientists to always clearly remember Zhdanov.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联全国人民痛悼日丹诺夫\n\n1948-09-08\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联全国人民痛悼日丹诺夫\n    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联全国人民痛悼日丹诺夫之丧。当无线电于三十一日晚间播出噩耗之时，哀思即笼罩全国，人民闻讯，多热泪盈眶，各地均升起镶有黑边之丧旗或悬半旗志哀，报纸则均以整版篇幅刊载日丹诺夫逝世的公报与来自全国全世界各地的唁电。当晚，莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、加里宁、高尔基等地工人农民即纷纷举行追悼会。列宁格勒人民哀痛之深，非言语所可表达。因他们曾在反法西斯战争最艰苦年月中，在日丹诺夫领导下，与包围列宁格勒的德寇作殊死战，并击退了敌人。此地每一事物都使人回想到日丹诺夫无穷尽的布尔什维克的精力和永垂史册的功勋。在日丹诺夫领导了十多年的高尔基城，工人在追悼会上，回忆日丹诺夫过去的工作，提出许多个区都是在他指导下建筑起来的，莫洛托夫汽车工厂的第一块基石是他亲手奠立的。莫斯科“红色无产阶级”工厂追悼大会上，退伍军人工人德米特里希密夫在演讲时指出：“我们工厂全体工人与整个工人阶级必须把这个损失补偿起来，我们必须更亲密地团结在党和斯大林同志周围。”苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫在真理报著文称：日丹诺夫之死，使苏维埃知识界和世界进步文化界丧失了苏维埃新文化杰出的理论家，苏联科学家深感哀痛。日丹诺夫对于整个苏维埃科学的精神及其各个部门的特性的了解，具有特出的明确性。我们的科学家和科学机关在有关科学之本质和组织的一切重要原则问题上，都得到日丹诺夫的指示、建议和最透彻的论述，我们科学家的责任就是永远清晰地记忆着日丹诺夫。"

    "author": "Su Shiqi",

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "[North Yue News] Hefang Village in Jianping Second District has eighty-five households, with eighty-two men aged eighteen to fifty-five. Excluding five disabled individuals, there are seventy-seven able-bodied laborers. Adding the village's forty-seven donkeys, which equate to forty-seven laborers, and one mule, which equates to two laborers, the village has a total of one hundred and twenty-six laborers. In the past, assigning tasks was quite difficult. Some militiamen would bring up old grievances whenever a task was assigned, and were unwilling to participate. There were even individual militiamen who would frequently feign illness and request leave whenever a task was assigned. When others went out on duty, they would be found working in the fields. Instances even occurred where wartime service committee members couldn't find the squad leader, and squad leaders couldn't find their members. However, these phenomena were not appropriately addressed. Over time, honest and proactive individuals also became reluctant to participate, saying, \"We are not afraid of going on duty, but we resent the unfairness. Long duties are still long, and short duties are still short. There is no decision from above, and no rewards or punishments.\" Obviously, this opinion was very correct, and the wartime service cadres agreed with this statement, but they couldn't find a way to achieve it. Why?\n\nFirst, the cadres were afraid of offending people and dared not struggle against the phenomenon of shirking duty, and dared not refuse those who feigned illness and asked for leave.\n\nSecond, the wartime service department had not established a system. For example, regarding leave, there were no specific regulations regarding who could ask for leave under what circumstances, when to ask, etc. Therefore, mischievous and backward people frequently asked for leave, avoiding arduous, heavy, and long duties. The wartime service department could not calculate short duties, and even if they could, they were not compensated. This created a chaotic situation regarding leave. Secondly, systems such as equal work distribution were also not established.\n\nThird, the wartime service cadres were afraid of trouble, and the work records were unclear. Each time a task was assigned, the wartime service committee member and the wartime service accountant only responsible for assigning the task to each squad and maintaining balance between the squads. However, they did not specifically help the squad leaders maintain a balance of duty among the people. Originally, according to the unified regulations of the county and district, each laborer should carry fifty catties of weight for thirty li (that is, 1,500 catty-li) to be equivalent to one work unit. However, some squad leaders, in order to save trouble or due to limitations in their writing and calculation skills, often did not record catties and li when recording work, only recording that someone had been on duty a certain day. In this way, it was impossible to calculate how many work units were equivalent to one duty performed by someone on a certain day. Therefore, when assigning tasks, even if those performing short duties claimed they had carried for long distances, the wartime service cadres could not expose them.\n\nFourth, some wartime service cadres lacked a selfless spirit and often prioritized personal relationships. For example, the assignment in April of the previous year was a typical example. The hospital in Zhongshe was moving to Haotian. On the first night, the village received an order from the station to send × stretchers to transport the wounded the next morning. Therefore, the wartime service committee member, in collaboration with the squad leaders, assigned the stretchers overnight and notified each of the militiamen who were to go on duty. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the station sent another order, requesting that more people and livestock be sent to Hongzidian to carry grain, because carrying stretchers was heavy, and carrying grain was light, some wartime service cadres prioritized personal relationships, and withdrew two stretcher bearers who were on good terms with them to carry grain, and replaced them with two other militiamen to carry stretchers. This aroused the opposition of all the militiamen, who all complained about unfairness, and no one was willing to go on duty. The whole morning was a mess, leaving the wartime service cadres at a loss and speechless. Finally, after repeated requests from all the cadres, the militiamen reluctantly went on duty.\n\nAs mentioned above, the chaotic situation in the village's wartime service department persisted until it was thoroughly cleaned up in January of last year.\n\nIn January of last year, the village's wartime service department underwent a re-election. The masses carefully elected Liu Shu and Liu Tai, whom they supported, as wartime service committee member and accountant. After taking office, they first broke with the concept of favoritism. They said, \"If you are afraid of offending people and do not handle public affairs fairly, the masses will be dissatisfied, and you will offend even more people. If you handle public affairs fairly, even if a few bad people are dissatisfied, you are not afraid of offending them.\" After taking over the work, they never showed any hesitation in the face of difficulties, but actively and proactively solved all the difficulties in the work.\n\nFirst, they helped the wartime service cadres implement equal work distribution, spending more than ten days sorting out past accounts, posting lists of those who had worked long hours and those who had worked short hours, and explaining that those who had worked long hours would work less in the future, and those who had worked short hours would make up for it. However, for two squads, the accounts were so carelessly recorded on weekdays that they could not be settled. Therefore, with the consent of all the members of the squad, a conclusion was also made. According to estimates, those who had worked long hours would work a little less in the future, and those who had worked short hours would make up for a portion. The specific numbers of reduced and compensated work units were specifically stipulated at the squad meeting. Subsequent work records were then started anew.\n\nSecond, various systems were established, starting with the establishment of a leave system. With the consent of the entire village, the wartime service department stipulated that no matter when, anyone, or livestock, if they were sick, they should report to the wartime service department at any time. Wartime service cadres took turns being on duty to register. In this way, during the period when people and livestock were sick, they would not be assigned to duty. If it was their turn to go on duty, the wartime service cadres could skip the names of the sick and assign duties to those further down the list. Here, in order to prevent the phenomenon of shirking duty, it was further stipulated that those with serious illnesses who were bedridden would have their names skipped, and those who had not been on duty would not be compensated for in the future. Those with minor illnesses who could do their own work but could not go on duty would have to make up for it next time they were on duty. This unified regulation won the unanimous support of the entire village, who all said, \"Who can live without sickness? Everyone abides by the regulations, no one suffers a loss, and no one gains an advantage.\" This can not only prevent the phenomenon of individual shirking duty, but also take care of the sick, enabling equal work distribution. Otherwise, before the chronically ill are exempted from duty, they cannot make up for it, making it impossible to equalize work with other militiamen, making it easy for mischievous people to use it as an excuse to shirk duty. Secondly, a system for reporting leave for people and livestock was also stipulated. Those who reported leave would have their names skipped by the wartime service cadres when it was their turn to go on duty, and they would make up for it the next time they were on duty. Those who went out without reporting leave, and had no one to replace them at home, the wartime service cadres had the right to find someone or livestock to go on duty for them, and the wages would be paid by them.\n\nThird, the wartime service accountant controlled the work records and determined a unified and scientific method of recording work. In the past, the work record book was controlled by the squad leaders, and the recording methods were not unified. As mentioned earlier, some recorded the number of trips, some recorded catties but not li, and some recorded li but not catties, making it difficult to equalize work. This time, it was uniformly stipulated that the wartime service accountant would record the work, and the squad leaders' responsibility was only to call people. After the wartime service accountant took control of the record book, he learned from past lessons and never recorded the number of trips. Each work record was clear and transparent.\n\nSecondly, there were also unified regulations on the method of converting work units for substitute cultivation work and trip duties. For example, one work unit was set at ten points (the time before breakfast was set at two points, the time from breakfast to lunch was set at four points, and the time from lunch to dinner was set at four points). These specific regulations strictly limited the phenomenon of mixed work units. In the past, militiamen would cultivate land for military families (allocate temporary workers), and one morning would be equivalent to one work unit, and one afternoon would also be equivalent to one work unit, as well as the phenomenon of going on duty for ten or eight li and being equivalent to one work unit was also eliminated.\n\nThe order of assigning duties was also fixed in a certain sequence. Generally, those who had worked shorter hours were assigned duties first, followed by those who had worked longer hours. But when two people had worked the same length of time, they were assigned duties according to the order in the roster. The village's roster was arranged from house to house from the back street to the front street.\n\nAgain, a running account method was not adopted when recording work, because the running account method could not equalize work at any time, so it took a lot of time to settle accounts every month. They adopted a method of recording work based on households and based on labor. Each time work was recorded, it was actually equivalent to each time work was equalized.\n\nFor example, how much work have militiamen Liang Rugui and Liu Tai each performed? Who should go on duty first next time? You can tell by looking at the account book.\n\nThis method of recording work, on the one hand, facilitates the assignment of tasks. At the same time, because a regular calculation system has been established, after a certain period of time, cadres do not need to spend a lot of time settling accounts. However, in order to gather more opinions from the masses and make it more fair, the village still established a regular inspection system, inspecting work units every two or three months, summarizing once a year, and posting lists. Everyone agreed that if individual militiamen did not participate in the work unit inspection or did not look at the posted list, and they raised objections when they were assigned to duty, then all militiamen would have the right to criticize him. At the same time, the squadron, through democratic discussion by all the villagers, stipulated that \"it is not allowed to turn over old accounts when assigning duties, and if you have any opinions, turn them over after returning from duty.\" This decision was made in order not to delay the dispatch of tasks.\n\nAfter this reorganization, Hefang's wartime service work has become a model for the entire district. Whether it is during the busy farming season or during heavy rain, as long as the order for wartime service comes, the task is immediately assigned, and no noise or shouting is heard. The militiamen always quietly lead their livestock, carrying ropes and cloth bags, to the designated place to assemble. For example, the assignment on the fifteenth day of the sixth lunar month was a typical good example. It was raining heavily that day, and the order came from above to transport ammunition to a certain place. The wartime service cadres braved the heavy rain and immediately assigned the tasks. The militiamen all prepared dry food and stood by for departure. Later, the county sent an order to stop them from leaving.\n\nFor more than a year, no cadres have been heard complaining in the village's wartime service department. Automatically meeting at the wartime service department after dinner every day seems to have become their habit. When the masses mention the names of Liu Shu and Liu Tai, everyone praises them, saying, \"They handle things fairly.\" At the same time, the masses also believe that the village's wartime service work can be done well even if it is handed over to other cadres. Because it has laid a good foundation.\n\nFrom the village's wartime service work, we have come to this experience: as long as the cadres are selfless, actively responsible, there is nothing that cannot be done well in the village.\n\n(Su Shiqi)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服混乱现象建立合理制度　河方战勤工作经过整顿成为建屏二区全区模范\n苏式琪\n1948-09-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　克服混乱现象建立合理制度\n  　河方战勤工作经过整顿成为建屏二区全区模范\n    【北岳讯】建屏二区河方全村八十五户，其中有十八岁到五十五岁的男人八十二个，除了五个残疾者以外，能够出差的劳动力七十七个。加上村里四十七头毛驴顶四十七个劳动力，和一头骡子顶两个劳动力；全村共有劳动力一百二十六个。过去，派差相当困难，有的自卫队员一派差就要翻老帐，不愿出差，还有个别的自卫队员，往往一派差，就要告病假，旁人出差了，他又下地做营生，甚至派差时，战勤委员找不着班长，班长找不着队员的事情，也曾发生过。但是，对这些现象，没有适当的处理。久而久之，老实积极的人也不愿出差了，他们说：“我们不怕出差，只嫌不公，长差的尽管长，短差的尽管短，上面没个主张，也没个赏罚。”很显然的，这个意见是很正确的，战勤干部也同意这个说法，只是他们没有办法做到这一条，为什么呢？\n    第一、干部害怕惹人，对躲差的现象不敢进行斗争，对装病告假的人又不敢不准。\n    第二、战勤部没有建立制度，例如告假问题，什么人在怎样的情形下可以告假？何时告？……等等均无具体的规定。所以，调皮落后的人经常告假，遇苦差、重差、长差不出，短了差战勤部算不出来，即便算出来又不补。这样一来，在告假问题上便形成了混乱的现象。其次，关于齐工等制度，亦未能建立起来。\n    第三、战勤干部怕麻烦，工帐不清楚，每次派差，战勤委员和战勤会计，只负责将差派到各班，掌握了班与班之间的出差平衡。但是，却没有具体帮助班长掌握人与人之间的出差平衡。本来，根据县、区统一规定，每个劳动力背五十斤的重量，送三十里路程（即一千五百斤里）顶一个工。但是，有的班长为了省事，或者是由于写算技术的限制，记工的时候往往不记斤、里，只记某天某人出差一趟，这样一来，某天某人出差一趟顶工多少便无从记算了。所以派差的时候，尽管短差的人说自己长送，战勤干部也无法揭露他。\n    第四、个别的战勤干部缺乏大公无私的精神，往往要私情，譬如前年四月的一次派差，便是一个典型的例子，中舍的医院要往郝田搬，第一天黑夜，村里接到站上的命令，派担架×付，翌日清晨出发运伤员，于是，战勤委员协同班长连夜派好了担架，分别通知了各个出差的自卫队员。不料，次日清晨站上又来了个命令，要再派人和牲口若干到洪子店驮粮食，因为抬担架差重，驮粮食差轻，个别的战勤干部要了个私情，抽下了两个和自己相好的担架队员去驮粮食，另补了两个自卫队员去抬担架。这一来，便引起了全体自卫队员的反对，谁都嚷着不公，谁也不肯出差了。整整的闹了一个上午，弄得战勤干部束手无策，哑呒言。最后，经过全体干部再三央求，自卫队员们才勉勉强强出了差。\n    如上所述，该村战勤部门的混炖现象，一直延至去年正月，才得到了彻底的清理。\n    去年正月，该村战勤部门进行了一次改选。群众认真的选出了自己拥护的刘树、刘太担任战勤委员和会计。他们担任了干部，首先破除了情面观点，他们说：“怕惹人不沾，公事办不公群众不满意，惹的人更多。公事办公了，少数坏人不满意，也不怕得罪他。”他们接手工作以后，从没有在困难面前表示过畏缩，而是积极主动的解决了工作中的一切困难。\n    第一，他们帮助战勤干部实行齐工，花了十多天的工夫，清理了过去的帐目，贴出了长工者和短工者的名单及其长短数，并说明长工的以后少出，短工的补工。但是，有两班，由于平日帐目记得草率，无法结算。于是，在本班全体队员的同意下，也做了一个了结。根据估计，长工多的以后少出一点，短工多的以后补出一部分。少出和补工的数目，在班的会议上都有了具体的规定。以后的工帐便重新开始。\n    第二，建立了各种制度，首先是建立了请假制度。在全村群众同意下，战勤部规定，不论何时，何人或牲口，有病都要随时向战勤部告假。战勤干部轮流值日，负责登记。如此，在人和牲口生病的期间，轮不到它和他出差便罢，若轮到他和它出差的时候，战勤干部便可跳过病号的名字往下轮派。这里为了防止躲差现象，又更进一步的规定：凡重病卧床不起者，跳过他的名字，没有出差的，以后不补差。轻病号能干自己的营生而不能出差的，得于下次出差时补出。这种统一的规定，博得了全村群众的一致拥护，都说：“谁吃五谷不生灾，大伙儿的规定大伙儿遵守，谁也吃不了亏，谁也沾不了光。”这样既可防止个别人的躲差现象，又可照顾病人，能够齐工。否则，久病者没有免差以前，不能补差，便无法与其他自卫队员齐工，容易给调皮人以躲差的借口。其次，又规定了人和牲口外出告假制，出外告假者，轮他出差时，战勤干部便跳过他的名字往下轮派，下次出差时他补差。若外出不告假者，家里又无人顶替的，战勤干部有权替他觅人觅牲口出差，工钱多少由他出。\n    第三，战勤会计掌握工帐，确定了统一的科学的记工方法，过去记工簿由各班班长掌握，记法不统一，如前段所述，有记趟子差的，有记斤不记里的，有记里不记斤的，以致齐工时发生困难。这次统一规定由战勤会计记工，班长的责职仅仅是叫人，战勤会计掌握了簿帐以后，接受了过去的教训，从来不记趟子差。每次的记工都是一清二白。\n    其次，关于代耕工和趟子差的折工办法也有统一的规定，例如，一个工定十分（早饭以前的时间定二分，早饭至午饭的时间定四分，午饭至晚饭的时间又定四分），这种具体的规定严格的限止了混工的现象，过去，自卫队员给军属代耕（拨临时工），一早上顶一个工，一下午也顶一个工，以及出差十里八里都顶一个工的现象也就从此根除了。\n    派差的先后也均有一定的序列。一般地，是遇差先派短工的人，后派长工的人。但在两人出工同样长短时，则按花名册子的先后次序派。该村的花名册子，是从后街挨门挨户排到前街的。\n    再次，记工时不采取流水帐的记法，因为流水帐的记法不能随时齐工，因而每月结算时花费时间很多。他们采取了以户为单位，以劳动力为基础的记工办法。每次记工，实际上便等于每次齐工。\n    譬如：自卫队员梁儒贵、刘太各出工多少，下次出差应谁先去？一看帐簿便可知道。\n    这种记工方法，一方面派差方便，同时，因为建立起了经常的计算制度，经过一定的时间以后，干部便不需要用很多时间去结算帐目。但是，为了更多的吸取群众的意见，做得更加公平。该村依然确定了定期的检查制度，二月三月一查工，一年一总结，并贴清单。大家公约，如果有个别的自卫队员，查工时他不去参加，贴了清单也不看，派他出差他便提意见。那么，全体自卫队员都有批评他的权利。同时中队部由全村农民民主讨论规定了一条“临派差时不许翻帐，有意见出差以后回来翻”。这个决定是为了不误支差工作。\n    经过这番整理以后，河方的战勤工作，已经成为全区的模范。无论是农忙的时候，或下大雨，只要战勤差的命令一来，差便立刻派下，听不到吵吵，也听不到嚷嚷，自卫队员们总是静悄悄的牵着牲口，带着绳索、布袋走到指定的地点去集合。如阴历六月十五日的派差，便是一个典型的好例子。那天正在下着倾盆大雨，上面来了命令，要往某地去运子弹，战勤干部冒着大雨，马上把差派下了，自卫队员们个个准备了干粮，待命出发。后来县里来了命令才停下没走。\n    一年多以来，在该村的战勤部门，从没听到干部叫苦的声音，每天晚饭以后，自动到战勤部碰碰头，似乎已经成了他们的习惯。群众一提到刘树、刘太的名字，是人人称道，都说“他们办的公平。”同时，群众也相信该村的战勤工作，现在交给别的干部也能办得好。因为它已经打下了好的基础。\n    从该村的战勤工作，我们得出这样一个经验，只要干部大公无私，积极负责，村里没有办不好的事情。　\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（苏式琪）"

Communist parties and trade unions of various countries, as well as governments and parliaments of people's democracies, sent telegrams to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government to express their condolences upon hearing the sad news. Soviet embassies abroad have been receiving a steady stream of telegrams of condolence from the laboring people of their host countries. Democratic newspapers in various countries have published detailed news reports of Zhdanov's death in prominent positions, and have written articles of mourning. In the people's democracies of Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Albania, workers in factories have held memorial services. The Albanian government, upon receiving the sad news on the evening of the 31st, convened a special meeting at midnight and decided to order the nation to fly flags at half-mast until the deceased is buried. The Political Bureau of the Romanian Workers' Party held a meeting on the morning of the 1st, where Comrade Luca, the secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, reported on the life of the deceased. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, with two million members, flew flags at half-mast at the location of each of its organizations. The French Communist Party, represented by Thorez, and the Japanese Communist Party, represented by Nosaka Sanzo, sent telegrams to Stalin on behalf of their respective central committees to express their condolences. In addition, the People's Socialist Party of Cuba and the Communist Party of Uruguay, far away in South America, and even the Communist Party of Morocco in Africa, also sent telegrams of condolence. Democratic newspapers in Norway and Sweden wrote articles pointing out that the death of such an outstanding leader as Zhdanov is not only a most painful loss for the Soviet people, but also for the international workers' movement. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper, Unità, published an editorial calling: In memory of Comrade Zhdanov, we pledge to continue the struggle to defeat imperialism, which enslaves our country and provokes new world wars, with even greater efforts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 全世界劳动人民　哀悼日丹诺夫\n\n1948-09-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　全世界劳动人民\n  　哀悼日丹诺夫\n    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：全世界劳动人民同声哀悼日丹诺夫之逝世，各国共产党、职工会与各人民民主国家政府与议会等在惊闻噩耗后即纷纷致电联共中央与苏联政府吊唁，苏联各驻外使馆源源接到驻在国劳动人民唁电，各国民主报纸均在显要地位刊载报导日丹诺夫逝世的详细消息，并撰论哀悼。在捷、罗、保、匈、波、阿等人民民主国家，各工厂工人均举行追悼大会。阿尔巴尼亚政府于三十一日晚间接获噩耗后，于午夜召开特别会议，决定通令全国下半旗志哀，直到死者安葬为止。罗马尼亚工人党政治局于一日清晨举行会议，由罗共书记卢加报告死者生平。拥有二百万党员的捷克斯洛伐克共产党，其每一组织的所在地均悬旗志哀。法国共产党由多列士、日本共产党由野板参三代表各该党中央委员会电斯大林吊唁。此外，远在南美的古巴人民社会党、乌拉圭共产党，甚至在非洲的摩洛哥共产党亦均去电吊唁。挪威与瑞典民主报纸均撰论指出：象日丹诺夫这样杰出的领袖之逝世，不仅是苏联人民，而且是国际工人阶级运动的最悲痛的损失。意共团结报社论号召：为纪念日丹诺夫同志，我们保证以更大的努力继续为击败奴役我们国家、挑动新的世界战争的帝国主义而斗争。"

    "content": "The Experience of Agricultural Loans in Central Hebei Proves That Loans are Real and Accounted for, Benefiting Both the Public and Private Sectors\n[Central Hebei News] In the past, the issuance of agricultural loans in Central Hebei carried a serious \"gift-giving\" and relief perspective. The understanding of using loans to support production was vague. As a result, loans could not play their due role, and bank loan funds suffered losses year after year. It was also difficult to ensure that the masses could buy certain means of production, or the price stability was often affected due to everyone rushing to purchase at the same time. To make agricultural loans truly benefit both the public and private sectors, both maintaining the state's capital from being lost and achieving the long-term goal of supporting the masses in developing production, it is necessary to overcome the \"gift-giving\" and relief perspective and strictly separate production loans from relief. During the trial implementation of \"loans being real and accounted for\" in May and June, many people realized that \"loans being real and accounted for\" benefited both the public and private sectors, and price fluctuations had no impact after accounting for the real value. The masses in Shenze County, Ninth District, reflected: \"This method is good. Farmers rely on what comes out of the land. If it weren't for this (referring to loans being real and accounted for), the price of grain would drop after the autumn harvest, and we couldn't bear it.\" Guo Jinian and Zhang Fushan from Nanmazhuang, Ningjin, who borrowed money for waterwheels, said: \"Grain is so expensive now. If it isn't converted into grain, the grain price will fall after the autumn harvest, and we might not be able to repay it. Now that we have converted it into grain, we are not afraid.\" Of course, in the early stage of converting to real value, due to insufficient publicity and imperfections in specific practices, some people still had concerns about converting to real value. In Beikanwei Village, Gaoyang, because the cadres did not have enough understanding of converting to real value and did not explain it well to the masses, the masses did not understand the idea and were afraid of suffering losses if the grain price rose in the future. Feng Ming from Dongsan Village, Third District, Shenze, had a strong desire to buy a waterwheel. When it was decided to lend him one million yuan (equivalent to 1,700 catties of rice), he calculated that all the grain produced on his eleven mu of irrigated land would have to be used, leaving his family with no grain to eat. He refused to buy the waterwheel, but after the cadres explained that he could borrow in large amounts and repay in small installments, he dared to borrow the money. Some specific practices of converting to real value were not well-considered, making it difficult for the masses to accept. For example, the real value conversion price in Lixian was divorced from the market, and the masses were unwilling to convert. The grain price in Xinle Third District differed from the city price by 5,000 yuan per dou, and the masses stopped converting. The solution to this problem is to convert according to the average transaction price of the central market at that time and place, and the masses are willing to convert. The deadline stipulated in some areas was inappropriate, so the masses were not easily accepted. The vice-industry loan in Beihao Village, Anping, was converted to real value with a three-month deadline. The masses said: \"Returning it in three months is exactly when the harvest is lean and rice is expensive, we will not convert to rice.\" They preferred to return it after the autumn harvest. From the practice of loans being real and accounted for, it has been tested that loans being real are easier for the masses to accept than loans being accounted for, especially for short-term sideline loans. The masses are not only difficult to accept, but also extend the borrowing period, making it difficult to achieve continuous circulation. For example, the masses in Zhuanghe Village, Jin County, suggested: \"Didn't you used to exchange cotton for cloth? This method is good, why don't you do it this way?\" Therefore, it is necessary to combine the two methods of loan conversion and loan actuals. This is very necessary. This spring, various regions held loans in real and accountable forms, roughly divided into three forms. One is that the production promotion agency (or bank) directly manufactures and purchases and transports production materials to supply the masses. The second is lending grain and returning grain. The third is to issue loans from organizing the masses to combine private capital and collectively purchase production materials to make up for their insufficient parts. Through these various forms of loans in kind, it has been proven that loans in kind not only overcome phenomena such as embezzlement, waste, and fraudulently obtaining loans under false names, but more importantly, loans in kind solve the masses’ procurement difficulties, save expenses, avoid stimulating prices, and ensure that all loans are used for development. production. In the future, if we can achieve a planned and close combination of loans in kind, conversion, and warehouse management. Timely solving the difficulties encountered by the masses after loans are actually made, and immediately purchasing the necessary means of production, will be even more supported by the masses. Moreover, on the basis of mutual benefit for the public and private sectors and developing production, not only can the agricultural loan funds of the National Bank be fully maintained, but they can even be strengthened. Furthermore, issuing agricultural loans can truly and effectively achieve the goal of developing production.\n(Dong Zhiming)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中农贷经验证明　贷实折实公私两利\n董志明\n1948-09-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中农贷经验证明\n  　贷实折实公私两利\n    【冀中讯】冀中过去的农贷发放，都带着严重的恩赐帐济观点，对贷款用于扶植生产的认识是模糊的。因之贷款不能发挥其应有作用，且造成银行贷款资金年年亏损，又难保证群众买到一定的生产资料，或常因一齐下手争购，影响了物价稳定。要使农贷真正作到公私两利，既能保持国家资本不受损失，又能达到长期扶植群众发展生产之目的，必须克服恩赐赈济观点，使生产贷款与救济严格分开。五、六两个月试行贷实折实中，不少群众都认识到贷实折实是公私两利的，折实后物价涨落都无影响。九分区深泽县群众反映：“这个办法好，庄稼人就是地里出粮食的一着，不那么着（指贷实折实），秋后粮一抽价，可受不了。”宁晋南马庄贷水车的郭尽念、张夫山说：“这时粮食这样贵，如不折成粮食，秋后粮价落了，说还不起就还不起，现在折起粮食来，咱们就不怕了。”当然在折实初期，由于宣传不深入和具体作法上不够完善，因此部分群众对折实还存在着顾虑。高阳北看苇村，因干部对折实认识不够，未向群众进行很好解释，所以群众思想不通，怕将来粮涨了，折实吃亏。深泽三区东三村冯名要求买水车的劲头很大，当决定贷给他一百万元（折米一千七百斤），他算着十一亩水地产粮都得用了，一家无吃粮，说什么也不买水车了，后经干部解释可以整借零还，才敢贷下来。由于某些折实的具体作法上考虑不周，也使群众不易接受，如蠡县折实价格脱离了市场，群众不愿折。新乐三区与城里粮价每斗相差五千元，群众不折了。解决这个问题的办法是：按当时当地中心集市的中等成交价格来折合，群众才愿意了。在期限上某些地区规定不适当，所以群众也不易接受。安平北郝村副业贷款折实限期三个月。群众说：“三个月归还，正是青黄不接米贵的时候，俺不折米。”而愿过秋归还。从贷款折实贷实中，考验到贷款折实不如贷实群众易接受，特别是短期的副业贷款，群众不仅不易接受，而且会使借款时期延长，很难作到川流不息。如晋县庄合寨群众提议：“你们过去不是以棉换布吗？这个办法好，何以不这样作。”因此贷款折实与贷实两种作法应结合起来，是很必要的。今春各地举办贷实折实，大致分为三种形式，一种是生产推进社（或银行）直接制造购运生产资料，供给群众。二是贷粮还粮。三是从组织群众结合私资集体采购生产资料中发放贷款，以补足其不足部分。在通过这些各种贷实形式中，均已证明贷实不仅克服了挪用浪费、冒名骗取贷款等现象，更重要的是贷实解决了群众的采购困难，节省开支，与避免剌激物价，保证了全部贷款用于发展生产。今后我们如能作到贷实、折实、仓库保管三者有计划的密切结合起来。及时解决群众贷实后的出现困难，与立即购得必需的生产资料，就更为群众拥护。且在公私两利发展生产的基础上，则国家银行的农贷资金，不仅可以完全保持，甚至可以壮大，再则发放农贷也真正有效的达到发展生产之目的。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（董志明）"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-09",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Central Hebei Dispatch] Insect plagues have occurred successively in 3,449 villages in 27 counties in central Hebei, including Renqiu, Boye, Lixian, and Shulu, devastating autumn seedlings such as cotton and corn. After the pests appeared, local leading organs immediately mobilized the masses to capture and kill them. Some areas have largely eradicated the pests, while others are still actively engaged in capturing and killing them. Preliminary experience has been gained in pest control in various places. The following is an introduction for reference:\n\n(1) Timely break down ideological obstacles among the masses and eliminate concerns. When mobilizing the masses to capture and kill the pests at the beginning, some people had ideas of relying on heaven for harvest and fatalism. Serious insect plagues occurred in villages such as Yibao in Renqiu. Only a few people were capturing and killing, and most of the masses said passively, \"There's nothing we can do.\" A small number of backward people considered them \"divine insects,\" burning incense and making wishes, not daring to capture and kill them. Some cadres and masses had paralysis and fluke mentality, thinking that the crops were about to ripen, so it didn't matter whether they were killed or not. Some masses had parochialism, fearing that their efforts would be wasted if others didn't join in. Some were afraid of damaging the crops if they failed to kill the pests. Some villages were too busy distributing seized wealth, and the masses didn't go to the fields in time, so they didn't discover the pests in time, which led to the spread of the disaster. For the above ideological obstacles, we must promptly conduct propaganda and explanation, explaining the harm of insect plagues and introducing pest control methods.\n\n(2) Cadres at all levels should attach great importance to this work, actively organize the masses, and personally go to the fields to lead the capture and killing. The party and government leading organs in the Eleventh Sub-district and counties and cities attached great importance to pest control. In Ningjin, all organs left only one or two people behind, and the rest went to the villages to help with pest control. The leading organs of the sub-district dispatched 47 cadres, led by Comrade Guo Fang, secretary of the local party committee, to personally go to the fields to capture and kill the pests, which had a great impact on the masses. Suining, Anguo and other places established district and village \"Insecticide Committees\" or \"Pest Control Headquarters\" and other organizations, and the main cadres participated in the leadership. They regularly reported on the disaster situation and inspected the work, which powerfully promoted the pest control work. However, some areas did not pay enough attention to the organization and leadership of this work, and allowed the disaster to develop. For example, after an insect plague occurred in the Ninth District of Renqiu, the central work of the district was still the distribution of seized wealth. When distributing seized wealth in Zhunzhuang, some people asked to kill the pests, but the district cadres explained to them, \"Distributing seized wealth is also very important.\" Some cadres leading the distribution of seized wealth in the villages turned a blind eye to the insect plague and did not report to the district for several days, resulting in a more serious development of the disaster.\n\n(3) After discovering an insect plague, we should concentrate our efforts to carry out encirclement and annihilation. If one round of killing is not clean, we should continue to capture and kill until the pests are completely eradicated to avoid regeneration. In the organization of pest control, some places mobilized all men, women, and children in the village to carry out large-scale cooperation and joint capture. However, according to the experience of various places, this large-scale cooperation method is very easy to become a formality. Many masses are concerned about their own land, and they are not careful when capturing and killing, which can easily damage the crops. Another method is to form small mutual aid groups freely combined by residents, neighbors, and family members. For example, in Liushuang Village, Anguo, the masses freely combined in groups of three or five families to jointly capture and kill the pests. The whole village organized a total of 28 groups, killing pests on more than 400 mu of land a day. This method is better. Another method is to take the household as a unit, with each family killing the pests on their own land. This method is not easy to damage the crops, and it is also easy to mobilize the whole family to kill the pests. However, to implement this method, we must strengthen leadership to prevent inconsistent steps and spontaneous phenomena. We must help some military families, cadre families, and families of martyrs who lack labor power, otherwise it will not be easy to completely eliminate the pests.\n\n(4) In terms of specific methods of capture and killing, some use sticky insect vehicles and sticky insect boats to capture and kill; some use scissors to cut and capture; some grind ash soil that has been burned for several years into powder on a millstone and sprinkle it on the crop leaves in the early morning when there is dew. The insects will die after eating it because their stomachs will swell; some dig ditches around the fields to prevent sticky insects from spreading to other fields and kill them after they climb into the ditches.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中各地灭虫经验\n\n1948-09-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中各地灭虫经验\n    【冀中电】冀中任邱、博野、蠡县、束鹿等二十七个县三千四百四十九村先后发生虫灾，不少棉花、棒子等秋苗被咬毁吃光。害虫发生后，各地领导机关立即发动全体群众进行捕打。部分地区已大部扑灭，部分地区仍在积极捕打中。各地捕打害虫，已获得初步经验，特介绍如下，供各地参考：\n    （一）及时打破群众思想障碍，消除顾虑。开始动员群众捕打时，部分群众存在着靠天收成及宿命思想。任邱议论堡等村发生了严重虫灭，只有几个人捕打，群众多消极的说：“没法拿”。少数落后群众则认为是“神虫”，烧香许愿，不敢捕打。部分干部和群众存在麻痹侥幸心理，认为庄稼快熟，打不打没关系，有的群众存在着本位思想，怕自己打别人不打白费劲。有的怕打不下来反糟踏了庄稼。还有的村因忙于分浮财，群众没到地里去，没有及时发现，以致蔓延起来。对于上述思想障碍，必须及时宣传解释。说明虫灾害处，介绍捕虫办法。\n    （二）各级干部应十分重视这个工作，积极组织群众，亲自下地领导捕打。十一分区的分区及县、市党政领导机关，对捕虫非常重视；宁晋各机关只留一两个人，其余都到各村帮助捕虫。分区领导机关抽出干部四十七人，由地委书记郭芳同志带领，亲自下地捕虫，对群众影响很大。肃宁、安国等地建立区村“杀虫委员会”或“捕虫指挥部”等组织，主要干部都参加领导。经常报告灾情，检查工作，有力的推动了捕虫工作。但有些地区对这一工作的组织领导不很重视，听任灾情发展。如任邱九区发生虫灾后，区里中心工作仍是分浮财。准庄分浮财时，有的群众要求打虫，区干部还给人家解释说：“分浮财也很重要。”有些在各村领导分浮财的干部，对虫灾熟视无睹，几天中没向区里报告，结果使灾情发展的更加严重。\n    （三）发现虫灾后，应集中全力实行围歼，一遍打不净，应连续捕打，作到彻底扑灭，以免再生。在捕虫的组织上，有些地方全村男女老幼一齐动员，实行大合伙，联合捕打。但根据各地经验看来，这种大合伙的办法很易流于形式。很多群众惦记自己的地，捕打的不小心，容易糟踏庄稼。另一种是按居住、地邻、本家自由结合组成小型互助组。如安国流双村群众三五家自由结合，联合捕打，全村共组织了二十八组，一天打虫四百余亩。这种办法比较好。还有一种是以户为单位，自家打自家的，这样不易糟踏庄稼，也便于动员全家去打。但实行这个办法，必须加强领导，防止步调不一致和自流现象。对一些缺乏劳动力的军、干、烈属，必须予以帮助，否则不易全部消灭。\n    （四）在捕打的具体办法上，有的用粘虫车、粘虫船捕打；有的用剪刀剪拿；有的把烧过数年的灰土，在碾子上砸成面，乘早晨有露水时撒在庄稼叶上，虫子吃后会肚胀而死；有的在地的四周挖沟，使粘虫不向别的地里蔓延，爬到沟里再弄死。"

    "content": "A certain company of a unit in the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region conducted timely reality education in the operational marching environment of protecting the wheat harvest in northern Henan and covering the repair of the Yellow River dikes in June and July, which played a significant role in consolidating the troops. The following is a description of how they did it: When protecting the wheat harvest in the Fengqiu and Yanjin areas of northern Henan, they frequently pursued the enemy, the weather was hot, and life was hard, so everyone's morale was somewhat low. The instructor asked everyone to investigate the living conditions of the masses. In Xin'an Village, the soldiers investigated that an old man was buried alive along with his entire family of five by the bandit Wang Sanzhu because he said the Eighth Route Army was good. The bandit Wang Sanzhu forced the people to beg for food everywhere. The instructor used the above materials in three lectures, and the class discussed it once. The soldiers said, \"Wang Sanzhu really doesn't let people live! We must fight him to the death.\" In several encounters, the soldiers of the company asked to fight a good battle.\n    After Kaifeng was captured, people from the city came to the liberated areas as if they were going to a fair. The company's cadres discussed that this was a good opportunity to educate the soldiers, so in the morning they mobilized the soldiers to ask the people coming out of the city what Kaifeng was like. In the soldiers' inquiries, some said, \"The Eighth Route Army's artillery is really powerful, one shot destroys a blockhouse.\" Some said, \"The Eighth Route Army is so good! The proclamation only arrests Liu Maoen, and others who don't carry guns are fine.\" The fleeing landlords said, \"We are going home to divide the land and live a good life.\" The quartermaster of the company's fellow villager was afraid of being mobilized to join the army, so he ran to Kaifeng and was wounded in the head by bombing. This time he ran back as well. People who were liberated from prison were especially affectionate to us. After this investigation, the soldiers said one after another: \"Kaifeng has been opened, releasing so many 'propagandists'. After hearing what they said, I think Chiang Kai-shek will be finished in less than three years.\" Some said, \"Running away at this time is really stupid!\"\n    After protecting the wheat harvest, they went to the south bank of the Yellow River to cover the repair of the dam. As soon as they were stationed in Sangcun Village, they were bombed by enemy planes. Five planes bombed the village into a mess. Some peddlers were bombed to death, and two demobilized soldiers were also injured. Although the company was not hit, some were afraid of Chiang's planes and unwilling to go to Henan to cover the repair of the dam. The instructor gave a class based on this situation, saying that if Chiang Kai-shek is not eliminated, no one can live in peace. You see that the demobilized comrades who were bombed said: \"We have to go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek.\" After class, the soldier Shi Fu said: \"This lecture is like washing your face with cold water after a nap (meaning it is refreshing). We can't live a good life without eliminating Chiang Kai-shek.\"\n    When they went to Henan to cover the masses in repairing the dangerous works at Gao Village, they heard that more than 110 migrant workers had been injured by airplanes in the past few days, so they gave the soldiers temporary education, and the soldiers said with hatred: \"How could China produce a bastard like Chiang Kai-shek, making the people so miserable!\"\n    After the task of covering the repair of the dike was completed, they sent the captured officers to Yongnian. At that time, the company's cadres discussed that many soldiers were from Ci County, and it was estimated that some soldiers would desert, so they decided to have the soldiers investigate the local mobilization and return to the team on the way, so as to carry out education. The troops were stationed in Nankai, Nanle, just in time for the district to hold a mobilization and return meeting. The village cadres said: \"The soldiers who run back must return to the team.\" Stationed in Jiahai Village, the soldier Lin Huoyuan asked an old man: \"Are there any recruits in your village?\" The old man replied: \"Three or four.\" He asked again: \"Did anyone run back?\" The old man said: \"Let him fight old Chiang, what's the point of running back!\" On the way, they met ten or so deserters being sent back to the troops. The instructor gave a speech to everyone at that time, explaining that deserters had to return to the team. After such education, the prisoners were sent back without a single deserter.\n    From the one-month-plus bookless education of the company, two points can be proved: First, the current situation of Chiang's bandits cruelly harming the people in the border areas and guerrilla areas, and the situation of our liberated areas supporting the front line, are very good living teaching materials. As long as the company's leaders consciously and organizedly mobilize the soldiers to investigate the situation of the masses based on the ideological situation of the company, and the instructor collects and summarizes the materials and seizes the education, it is possible to improve the class consciousness of the troops. Experience has proved that the company stopped troop desertions due to timely reality education around consolidating the troops. Second, education can be carried out in the operational marching environment. It is wrong to use the excuse of a tense environment, no teaching materials, and no access to newspapers to not carry out education.\n(Ji-Lu-Yu telegram)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫某部在作战行军中　随时进行现实教育　提高战士觉悟巩固部队\n\n1948-09-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫某部在作战行军中\n  　随时进行现实教育\n  　提高战士觉悟巩固部队\n    冀鲁豫军区部队某连，六、七月份，在豫北保卫麦收，及掩护修黄堤等作战行军环境中，及时进行了现实教育，对于巩固部队，起了很大作用。下面是他们进行的情形：在豫北封邱、延津一带保卫麦收时，经常追击敌人，天气热，生活苦，大家情绪有些不高。指导员让大家调查群众生活情形，在新安店，战士调查出一个老百姓因为说八路军好，全家五口人被王匪三祝活埋了，匪王三祝逼着老百姓到处要饭。指导员将以上材料以讲话方式上了三课，班里讨论了一次，战士们说：“王三祝真不叫人活啦！非跟他干一火不可。”几次遭遇战斗，一连战士都要求好好干一场。\n    开封打下来后，城里人象赶会似的往解放区来。一连干部商量，这是个教育战士的好机会，于是上午发动战士在公路边问问出来的人，打开封是啥样。战士询问中，有的说：“八路军炮真厉害，一炮打掉一个炮楼。”有的说：“八路军太好啦！出布告光捉刘茂恩，其他不拿枪都没有事。”逃亡地主说：“回家分地，过好日子。”一连司务长的同乡，怕动员参军，跑到开封去，头上被炸伤了，这次也跑回来。从监狱被解放出来的人，见了咱们特别亲热。战士们经过这次调查后，都纷纷的说：“开封打开，放出这样多‘宣传员’，听他们说后，我看蒋介石到不了三年就完蛋了。”有的说：“这个时候开小差，才真是傻瓜哩！”\n    保卫麦收后，到黄河南岸掩护修大堤，刚驻到桑村集，遭敌机轰炸，五架飞机将集上炸的一场糊涂，有的小贩被炸死了，两个复员军人也炸伤了，一连虽未炸着，却有的因而害怕蒋机，不愿到河南去掩护修堤。指导员根据此情况上课，说蒋介石消灭不了，谁也过不了安生日子，你们看复员的同志被炸着后说：“还得到前方去与蒋介石干。”课后战士石富说：“这一讲跟午睡起来凉水洗了洗脸一样（意即清醒了），不消灭蒋介石过不了好日子。”\n    到河南掩护群众修高村险工时，他们听说最近几天来被飞机打伤了一百一十多名民工，向战士又作了临时教育，恨的战士们说：“中国怎么出了个蒋介石这杂种，闹的老百姓多苦吧！”\n    掩护修堤任务结束后，送俘虏军官到永年去，当时连的干部商量，很多战士是磁县的，估计会有战士逃亡，因而决定在路上让战士调查地方动员归队情形，以便进行教育，部队驻南乐南开，恰巧小区开动员归队会，村干们说：“跑回的战士都得归队。”驻在贾海村，战士林霍元问一个老乡：“你们这村有参军的没有？”答：“三四个”。又问：“跑回来了没有？”老乡说：“叫他打老蒋哩，跑回来干啥！”在路上又碰见十来个逃亡战士往部队送，指导员当时即向大家讲了话，说明逃亡还得归队，经过这样教育，将俘虏送到又回来，没有一个逃亡的。\n    从一连一个多月来的没书本的教育中，可以证明两点：第一、目前在边缘区、游击区蒋匪惨害人民情形，与我们解放区人民支援前线情形，是一个很好的活教材，只要连的领导者，根据连队思想情况，有意识的，有组织的，发动战士调查群众情形，指导员收集总结材料，抓紧教育，是可以提高部队阶级觉悟的。经验证明，一连由于及时围绕着巩固部队进行现实教育，停止了部队逃亡。第二、在作战行军环境中，是可以进行教育的，借口环境紧张，没有教材，看不到报纸，不进行教育，是不对的。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（冀鲁豫电）"

    "content": "Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Convenes Border Area Conference\n\tSummarize Wheat Protection and Deploy Autumn Harvest\n\tJizhong District Party Committee Directs Full Effort for Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting\n[Taihang Electric] In order to strive for greater victories in the autumn harvest struggle, the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a border area conference on August 14th. Cadres from eight border counties, districts, and villages attended. They held group discussions by county, starting with a bottom-up summary of the wheat protection struggle, and raised three issues that must be noted in carrying out the autumn harvest struggle: First, mobilizing the masses in border areas must be based on implementing the new policy of shifting from land reform to organizing and mobilizing the masses for production, and organizing and expanding the anti-Chiang Kai-shek united front for border area struggle against the enemy. Second, mass guerrilla warfare must be launched, with a clear understanding that border area struggle must rely on the masses and the forms and organization of guerrilla warfare appropriate to different areas. Third, mass struggle against the enemy must be launched in enemy-occupied areas, focusing on the large-scale development of mass armed forces and the bold work of winning over and disintegrating bandits and puppet personnel. After five days of group discussion and research, and typical speeches at the general assembly, five kinds of experiences were specifically summarized from the three issues, including the mass joint defense struggle in wheat protection, the elimination of no-man's-lands, the development of the struggle against the enemy based on production, and the winning over of secret society armed forces and the disintegration of enemy military hidden work. At the same time, our major weaknesses were also discussed, and specific arrangements were made for the autumn harvest struggle.\n[Jizhong Electric] In order to specifically implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on land reform and party rectification work in 1948, the Jizhong District Party Committee specifically instructed the entire district that in September and October, whether land has been distributed or not, and in border areas, full effort must be made for autumn harvest and wheat planting. It pointed out that this year, more than 1,600 villages in Jizhong suffered severe floods, and 3,470 villages suffered insect plagues. Under these circumstances, the current autumn harvest and wheat planting has become the central task of reducing disasters, laying the foundation for next year's production, and supporting the war. The central issue of autumn harvest and wheat planting is the organization of people, animal power, and agricultural implements. Party committees at all levels should organize the masses to actively participate in production, and pay attention to mobilizing women to participate in autumn harvest and wheat planting. On the basis of the masses' existing production, small temporary mutual aid labor exchange groups should be organized under the principles of voluntariness and equivalence. At the same time, organs and troops must actively help the masses in the villages with autumn harvest and wheat planting. All economic departments must serve this work and solve the difficulties of the masses. In addition, different work priorities should be put forward according to different regions: in areas where land reform has been implemented, disaster areas should focus on production for disaster relief. Where there is no autumn harvest but wheat can be planted, the masses should be vigorously organized for production and disaster relief; in areas where there is no autumn harvest and wheat can be planted, all levels of the people should first be led to carry out a crash planting of wheat, and then the masses should be organized for sideline production. In wheat planting, every effort should be made to organize manpower, draught animals, and agricultural implements to solve the problem of wheat seeds and fertilizer. In areas where there is no disaster or the disaster is mild, and there is both an autumn harvest and wheat can be planted, the main thing is to first organize the masses to deliver manure and harvest the autumn crops, striving to plant as much land as possible that can be planted, and whoever plants the autumn seedlings will harvest them. In areas where land reform has not been implemented, the masses should be vigorously led in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. However, because the land has not been distributed, the masses are worried about planting wheat. It must be announced that whoever plants it will harvest it and whoever will bear the burden, and the land will be handed over after the wheat harvest next year (the same method will be used for land not distributed in areas where land reform has already been carried out). In the border areas, the armed forces must actively operate to protect the autumn harvest and wheat planting; strive to unite the broad masses to fight the enemy together. Strengthen militia work, implement joint defense for autumn protection, and combine labor and military to rush harvest and plant. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting, obstacles existing in different villages, such as the land being divided in a disorderly manner in some villages, the village-level organization being chaotic and unable to work, or the military family substitute farming being chaotic, should be appropriately adjusted and resolved without delaying the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In order to improve the production enthusiasm of people of all strata and break the concerns of the masses, it should be publicized that there will be no more equal division in areas where land reform has already been carried out (i.e., land has been fairly distributed or land has been basically equally divided). If some village cadres have inappropriate allocations and poor and hired farmers still lack land, and the land they lack is about 10% of the average number per person in the whole village, it will no longer be redistributed. And widely publicize the New China News Agency's editorial \"Take the agricultural production of the liberated areas one step further\" and the spirit of the North China People's Representative Conference's agricultural burden method. Regarding the issue of organization and leadership, party committees at all levels should conduct detailed discussions in accordance with the above spirit, and organize forces to deploy them to the villages before September 10. When cadres at all levels lead the masses in production, they should do so without delaying the masses' production and try to hold as few meetings as possible. Party committees at all levels must attach importance to production leadership and use key leadership methods to promote the general.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行五地委召开边地会议　总结护麦布置保秋　冀中区党委指示全力秋收种麦\n\n1948-09-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行五地委召开边地会议\n  　总结护麦布置保秋\n  　冀中区党委指示全力秋收种麦\n    【太行电】为了争取在保秋斗争中的更大胜利，中共太行五地委于八月十四日召开边地会议。到会有八个边沿县的县区村干部，以县为单位分小组座谈，首先经过自下而上的总结保麦斗争，提出开展保秋斗争中必须注意的三个问题：第一、边缘地区发动群众必须以贯彻由土改转向组织发动群众生产，和组织扩大反蒋统一战线的边地对敌斗争的新方针。第二、必须开展群众性的游击战争，明确认识边地斗争必须依靠群众和在不同地区下的游击战争的斗争方式和组织形式。第三、开展敌占区群众性的对敌斗争，以大量的发展群众武装和放手进行争取瓦解匪伪人员为主。经过五天的小组讨论研究和大会典型发言，从三个问题上具体的总结了保麦中的群众性的联防斗争、消灭无人区、以生产为基础开展对敌斗争及争取会门武装、瓦解敌军隐蔽工作等五种经验，同时也讨论了我们存在着的极大弱点，并具体布置了保秋斗争。\n    【冀中电】冀中区党委为具体执行中共中央关于一九四八年土改工作与整党工作指示，特指示全区在九、十月份中，不论已经分地或未分地及边缘区，均须全力进行秋收种麦工作。指出：今年冀中一千六百余村遭受严重水灾，三千四百七十村遭虫灾。在此情况下，当前秋收种麦已成为减缩灾荒，打下明年生产基础，支援战争的中心任务。而秋收种麦的中心问题是人、畜力、农具的组织，各地党委应组织群众积极参加生产，并注意发动广大妇女参加秋收种麦。在群众旧有生产基础上，在自愿与等价原则下，组织小型的临时互助换工组。同时机关部队必须积极帮助驻村群众秋收种麦。各经济部门必须为此工作服务，解决群众困难。另外应根据各地不同地区提出各种不同工作重点：在已实行土改的地区，灾区应以生产救灾为中心。无秋收又不能种麦的，应大力组织群众生产救灾；无秋收能种麦的地区，应首先领导各阶层人民突击种麦，再组织群众副业生产。种麦中要尽一切可能组织人力、耕畜、农具，解决麦种及肥料问题。无灾或灾轻又有秋收又能种麦的地区，主要是先组织群众送粪秋收，争取能种麦的地收一块种一块，秋苗谁种谁收。在未实行土改地区，应大力领导群众，秋收种麦。但因土地未分，群众对种麦有顾虑，必须宣布谁种谁收、谁负担，待明年麦收后再移交土地（已土改过的地区未分出的土地种麦亦用此法）。在边缘区，武装要积极活动，保卫秋收种麦；争取团结广大群众共同对敌斗争。并加强民兵工作，实行联防护秋，劳武结合抢收抢种。在秋收种麦期间，对不同村庄存在的障碍，如有的村土地分乱了，有的村级组织混乱无法工作，或军属代耕混乱等，在不误秋收种麦原则下，应适当调整和解决。为了提高各阶层人民生产积极性，打破群众顾虑，应宣传凡已土改地区不再平分（即指土地已经公平分配或土地已经基本上平分了的），如有的村干因分配不恰当，贫雇农还缺少土地，其所缺土地在全村每人平均数百分之十左右者，即不再重分。并根据新华社“把解放区农业生产提高一步”社论和华北人民代表会议关于农业负担办法的精神广泛宣传。关于组织领导问题，各级党委应根据上述精神，进行详细讨论，并组织力量，于九月十日前布置到村。各级干部在领导群众生产时，要作到不误群众生产，尽量少开会。各级党委必须重视生产领导，并运用重点领导方法推动一般。"

    "content": "Short essay:\n\n　　Launch the Autumn Harvest Protection Struggle\n\n    As the autumn harvest approaches, the Chiang bandits, besieged by our forces in a small area and a few isolated cities in North China, will undoubtedly intensify their looting due to the unprecedented famine of food. Therefore, protecting the autumn harvest has become the central task of the Party, government, army, and people in the border areas of north of Daqing River, Chahar South, Yanbei, northern Henan, southern Shandong, and the Yellow River area of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Province.\n\n    To accomplish the task of protecting the autumn harvest, the following work must be carried out resolutely and consistently.\n\n    First, we must conduct widespread and in-depth propaganda and ideological mobilization among the Party, government, army, and people in the border areas, so that the broad masses understand the significant role and meaning of protecting the autumn harvest and preventing the enemy from taking a single grain of food, which can accelerate the enemy's demise. We must overcome all paralysis and passive phenomena, and consciously and actively launch a grain protection struggle against the enemy.\n\n    Second, we must earnestly implement the policy towards the enemy in the border and guerrilla areas, continue to correct and avoid past deviations, strengthen leadership, and consolidate and expand the anti-American, anti-Chiang, patriotic united front. It must be clearly announced that land reform will be suspended in the border areas, and rent and interest reduction will be implemented (the vested interests of the peasants must be protected). We must carry forward the experience of the Anti-Japanese War and unite the largest number of people to fight against the enemy. At the same time, we must actively launch a political offensive, publicize the victories of our army, point out the overall collapse of the Kuomintang reactionaries in military, political, and economic terms, expose the Kuomintang's conspiracy to plunder the people by issuing fake gold yuan coupons, and correctly implement the policy of leniency, so that the broad masses of people and enemy officers and soldiers in the border areas can recognize the current situation and our Party's policies, disintegrate the enemy, strengthen our ranks, and defeat the enemy.\n\n    Third, we must learn from the experience and lessons of protecting the wheat harvest this summer. In the early stages of the summer wheat protection struggle, some areas were temporarily put in a passive position and suffered unnecessary losses due to insufficient prior vigilance and preparation. Later, the leadership in the border areas grasped the analysis of the situation, actively organized offensives, and took the initiative, thus reversing the situation. Therefore, in the autumn harvest protection struggle, we must remember this lesson, stay sober, and strive for initiative. The armed forces in the border and guerrilla areas should actively engage, look for opportunities to strike the enemy, and avoid passively dividing troops to guard key points, but should organize battles in a planned and focused manner. We must be good at utilizing our superior mass conditions, give full play to the tradition of combining labor and military affairs, launch a widespread mass guerrilla war, implement joint village defense, and launch an explosion movement. The economic and trade departments in the border areas should also organize forces to cooperate with the armed struggle to smash the enemy's conspiracy to buy and defraud food. At the same time, we must not only protect the autumn harvest of the masses in the border areas, but also go deep into the Kuomintang-controlled areas to prevent more of the masses' rations from being snatched by the enemy.\n\n    Fourth, implement quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick drying, quick storage, and quick planting.\n\n    This year's autumn harvest protection struggle is a part of the entire war and production task. With the victory of autumn harvest protection, the entire North China will be liberated more quickly; with the victory of autumn harvest protection, the foundation will also be laid for large-scale production in the border areas next year.\n\n    Grain is the lifeblood of the people, we must resolutely protect it!\n\n    Be proactive, combine military, political, and economic struggles, organize offensives, protect the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army on all fronts to strive for greater victories!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 开展保秋斗争\n\n1948-09-09\n第1版()\n专栏：短论\n\n　　开展保秋斗争\n    秋收将至，在华北被我围困在狭小地带与几个孤城的蒋匪，由于食粮的空前恐荒，必将更疯狂的进行抢掠，因此保卫秋收，就成为大清河北、察南、雁北、豫北、鲁南与冀鲁豫黄河南等边沿地区党政军民的中心任务。\n    为了完成保卫秋收任务，必须坚决一致的进行下列工作。\n    第一、要在边地党政军民内进行普遍深入的宣传与思想动员，使广大群众了解保卫秋收，不让敌人抢走一粒粮，可以加速敌人的死亡的重大作用与意义，克服一切麻痹消极现象，自觉的积极的对敌人展开保粮斗争。\n    第二、认真执行边沿区和游击区对敌政策，继续纠正和避免过去发生过的偏向，加强领导，巩固扩大反美、反蒋、爱国统一战线。要明确宣布边地停止土改，实行减租减息（对农民既得利益，则要予以保护），发扬抗日时期的经验，团结最大多数人民一致对敌。同时，积极开展政治攻势，宣传我军胜利，指出国民党反动派在军事、政治、经济上的总崩溃，指出国民党发行伪金元券对人民的大掠夺的阴谋，并正确执行宽大政策，使边地广大人民和敌军官兵认清时局和我党政策，瓦解敌人，壮大我们的队伍，战胜敌人。\n    第三、接受今夏保卫麦收经验与教训。今夏护麦斗争初期，由于事先警惕和准备不够，有些地区曾一时陷于被动，遭受不应有的损失。以后边地领导上抓紧分析形势、积极组织攻势，取得主动，才扭转了形势。因此，在保秋斗争中，我们要记取这一教训，保持清醒，力求主动。边缘区及游击区武装要积极活动，寻找机会打击敌人，不要消极的分兵把口，而要有计划有重点的组织战斗。要善于利用我们优于敌人的群众条件，发挥劳武结合的传统，开展广泛的群众游击战争，实行联村联防，开展爆炸运动。边地经济贸易部门，亦应组织力量，配合武装斗争，粉碎敌之收买、骗取食粮阴谋。同时，不仅要保卫边沿区群众的秋收，还要深入国民党统治区，使更多群众的口粮不被敌人抢去。\n    第四、实行快收、快打、快晒、快藏、快种。\n    今年的保秋斗争，是整个战争和生产任务的一部分。有了保秋的胜利，全华北就能更快获得解放；有了保秋的胜利，也就为边地明年大生产打下了基础。\n    粮食是人民的命根，我们要坚决保卫它！\n    积极主动，军事、政治、经济斗争相互结合，组织攻势，保卫秋收、秋耕、秋种，配合各线解放军争取更大胜利！"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, September 5th—The severe disasters suffered by the Jin-Sui Border Region last year and the year before have now been largely overcome. Peasants in various places are actively returning government loan grain and grain borrowed among villagers. When the masses in villages like Xia Liushui in Baode discussed returning the loan grain, an old peasant named Kang Jinjin said, \"During the famine in the Guangxu years, many people in our village starved to death. This year's disaster was even worse than that year, but fortunately, we had the help of our new government, and no one in the village died. Now, we must pay back what we borrowed, so that the government can help us again if we encounter difficulties in the future.\" Within a few days, the village handed over more than 3,000 jin of grain and 90 million yuan in loans. In the Jinpen Gou village of the Fifth District of Xing County, the logistics department of the military region helped with grain this spring, which solved the difficulty of sowing. Now, the villagers are enthusiastically returning the grain, and some peasants are personally delivering the grain to the cooperative. In Yonghe County, Jin-Southwest, the government instructed all districts and villages to recover wheat seeds borrowed last autumn in order to develop rural lending. Those borrowed between middle and poor peasants should be returned to the original owners. Those borrowed from landlords and rich peasants should be taken over by the village people's representative assembly since they are old debts before the land reform, and be kept as wheat seeds for this autumn. Note: In previous years, the democratic government issued loan grain and loans, but most of them were not recovered as stipulated, forming a semi-relief nature. As a result, on the one hand, some cadres shielded private embezzlement and corruption, and on the other hand, some people developed the idea of ​​relying on government relief, blurring the significance of loans for developing production and implementing self-reliance, and affecting the government's continued efforts to help the masses with production. At the same time, private lending in rural areas has also been hampered by the failure to provide adequate legal protection, hindering the development of lending relationships. This time, the return of public and private loan grain and loans will greatly benefit the revitalization of rural lending and the development of production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 有借有还活跃农村借贷　晋绥农民归还贷粮\n\n1948-09-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　有借有还活跃农村借贷\n  　晋绥农民归还贷粮\n    【新华社晋绥五日电】晋绥边区去年和前年所遭受的严重灾荒，现已基本上渡过，各地农民纷纷归还政府贷粮及农村互借粮。保德下流水等村群众商量归还贷粮时，老农康锦金说：“光绪年间的灾荒，咱村饿死不少人，今年灾荒比那年重，幸好有咱新政权帮助，全村一个人也没死。现在有借有还，以后再有困难政府才好帮助。”该村几天之内把粮食三千余斤，贷款九千余万元如数交清。兴县五区金盆沟等村今春曾由军区后勤部合作社帮助粮食一事，解决了下种时的困难，现各村村民均踊跃还粮，有的农民亲自把粮送上合作社去。晋西南永和县政府为发展农村借贷，特指示各区村归还去秋互借的麦籽，中贫农互借者归还原主，借自地富者，因系土改前之旧债，一律收归村人民代表会保存，作为今秋麦籽。按：民主政府历年发放贷粮贷款，绝大部分均未按规定收回，形成半救济性质，其结果一方面造成某些干部包庇私人贪污腐化的不良作风，一方面又造成一部分群众经常依赖政府救济的思想，模糊了贷款的发展生产实行自救的意义，影响政府继续发挥力量扶助群众生产。同时，农村私人借贷亦因未能很好予以合法的保障，阻碍了借贷关系的发展。此次归还公私贷粮贷款，对活跃农村借贷，发展生产大有裨益。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th: At the Labor Congress on the 21st of last month, Comrade Li Lisan gave a summary of the discussions on the current tasks of the Chinese labor movement. He first stated that all labor unions in the liberated areas, the Chinese Labor Association, representatives of democratic labor unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and representatives of major cities and industries, unanimously agreed with Comrade Gao Gang's political report and Comrade Chen Yun's report on the current tasks of the Chinese labor movement, based on their different practical experiences in various regions. They unanimously supported the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's general line and various policies in the current revolution. The representatives also unanimously and enthusiastically supported the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to convene a revolutionary political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries, opposing the reactionary rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang, and to establish a revolutionary coalition government. Comrade Zhu Xuefan, representative of the Labor Association, also submitted a written proposal for the realization of this proposal. All of these prove that the Sixth National Labor Congress marks the unprecedented great unity of the Chinese working class, not only establishing a unified national All-China Federation of Trade Unions in organization, but also achieving ideological consensus and unity of will. Through this congress, the unity of the national working class will be further consolidated, and the actions of the national working class will be more unified. With the leadership of such a united working class, the liberation struggle of the broad masses of the people will surely develop more vigorously and help the people's liberation war to accelerate its victory. Comrade Li Lisan pointed out that any reactionary ruling class, when it is about to perish, will always make a last-ditch struggle. For example, recently the Kuomintang reactionary group has carried out an unprecedented large-scale plunder in the economy with the so-called currency reform, issuing \"gold yuan\" banknotes; at the same time, it has organized special criminal courts and arbitrarily arrested people, using even more brutal means to suppress the resistance movement of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, especially workers and students. It can be asserted that all these struggles will only arouse the hatred of the people, strengthen the unity of the people, and more resolutely rise up to support the revolutionary war of the People's Liberation Army.\n\n\tComrade Li Lisan pointed out that the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has always inherited the glorious tradition of history. The future task of the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is, as pointed out in Comrade Chen Yun's report, to use tactics more flexibly, pay close attention to the methods and means of struggle, consolidate their positions, accumulate strength, expand their ranks, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, they must work hard to study production issues, prepare to immediately take control of enterprises and manage enterprises after liberation, prevent the enemy from sabotaging them before their demise, and do their best to protect machines, factories, and all materials, transforming bureaucratic capitalist enterprises into people's enterprises.\n\n\tRegarding the tasks of the labor movement in the liberated areas, Comrade Li Lisan first pointed out that, thanks to the extremely high consciousness of the workers and staff in the liberated areas, who have recognized their position as masters of the country, they have demonstrated amazing labor enthusiasm and created various heroic deeds. In short, Comrade Li Lisan pointed out that there are still many difficulties in developing production in the future, and the only reliable way to overcome these difficulties is to \"rely on the masses.\" Therefore, after explaining the issue of democratic management of public enterprises based on the principles and methods in Comrade Chen Yun's report, he proposed that public enterprises in various liberated areas should immediately begin to select key points, try out the organization of factory management committees, and establish employee representative conferences in larger enterprises with more than 500 people. The management committee should be composed of the factory director, technicians, and employee representatives. The factory director should have the final decision-making power. In case of emergencies, the factory director may handle the matter first and then submit it to the management committee for approval. If the factory director's opinion contradicts the opinion of the majority of the committee members, the factory director's opinion should be implemented first, and the matter should be reported to the higher authorities for instructions. Comrade Li Lisan summarized the four functions of the factory management committee and the employee representative conference: (1) to unite all employees, cooperate fully, and develop production; (2) to demonstrate the principle that employees are the masters of the enterprise in the organization, and to improve employees' labor enthusiasm, discipline, consciousness, and sense of responsibility for production; (3) to promote criticism and self-criticism, and overcome bureaucracy; (4) to cultivate employees' ability to manage production. He proposed entrusting the executive committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to study and formulate detailed regulations on factory management committees and employee representative conferences. Next, he gave a brief explanation of the issue of enterprise management, proposing nine conditions for achieving enterprise management: (1) strict production plan; (2) strict economic accounting system; (3) the administrative and wage system should be based on operating ability, technical knowledge, proficiency, and work attitude; (4) strict worker assessment system; (5) reasonable working conditions; (6) a reasonable organizational structure suitable for scientific management principles; (7) strict responsibility system; (8) labor discipline and reward and punishment system; (9) implementation of labor inspection and finished product inspection. In addition, he also provided explanations to the various questions and specific issues raised by the representatives, such as wage systems, working hours, leave issues, age limits for child labor, the necessity of labor contracts, and labor insurance. Regarding the issue of working hours, he pointed out that only small businesses or shops that cannot temporarily shorten working hours, and large enterprises that must operate day and night and consistently implement a two-shift system, may temporarily implement twelve hours; otherwise, it should be set at eight to ten hours.\n\n\tAfter Comrade Li Lisan's summary, the conference unanimously adopted the resolution on the current tasks of the Chinese labor movement and handed it over to the executive committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for textual modifications before publication. Regarding the constitution of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Comrade Li Lisan also provided detailed explanations to several issues raised by the representatives during the discussions that were questioned or disagreed with, and obtained the approval of the conference, which was handed over to the executive committee for textual modifications.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 李立三同志根据劳动大会讨论　总结中国工运当前任务\n\n1948-09-09\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　李立三同志根据劳动大会讨论\n  　总结中国工运当前任务\n    【新华社东北六日电】劳动大会于上月二十一日由李立三同志作大会关于中国职工运动当前任务讨论的总结。他首先说明：所有各解放区工会，中国劳动协会，国民党统治区各民主工会的代表，各大城市、各大产业的代表，在讨论中均根据各地不同的实际经验一致同意高岗同志的政治报告和陈云同志关于中国职工运动当前任务的报告，一致拥护中共中央在目前革命中的总路线和各种政策。各代表并一致热烈拥护中共中央所提出的召集没有反动派参加的、反对美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动统治的革命的政治协商会议、及成立革命的联合政府的主张；劳协代表朱学范同志并且为这一主张的实现提出了书面建议。这些都证明了第六次全国劳动大会标志着中国工人阶级的空前大团结，不仅在组织上成立了全国统一的中华全国总工会，而且取得了思想上的一致和意志的统一。经过这次大会，全国工人阶级的团结必更加巩固，全国工人阶级的行动必更加统一。有了这样团结统一的工人阶级的领导，广大人民的解放斗争一定会更汹涌的向前发展，帮助人民解放战争加速获得胜利。立三同志指出任何反动统治阶级快要灭亡时，总是要拼死作最后挣扎的。如最近国民党反动集团在经济上实行空前大掠夺的所谓币制改革，发行“金圆”钞票；同时，组织特种刑事法庭，滥捕人民。用更残暴的手段镇压国民党统治区的人民——首先是工人和学生的反抗运动。可以断言，这一切挣扎，只会更引起人民的仇恨，更加强人民的团结，更坚决地起来支援人民解放军的革命战争。\n    立三同志指出国民党统治区的工人阶级是始终继承着历史的光荣传统的。国民党统治区工人阶级今后的任务就是如陈云同志的报告中所指出的：要更灵活地运用策略，十分注意斗争方式和方法，巩固自己的阵地，积蓄力量，扩大队伍，准备迎接人民解放军。同时，要努力研究生产问题，准备在解放后，能立即掌握企业，管理企业；防止敌人在覆灭前的破坏，全力保护机器工厂以及一切物资，将官僚资本的企业转变为人民的企业。\n    关于解放区职工运动的任务，立三同志首先指出由于解放区的职工已有极高的觉悟，认清了自己主人翁的地位，因而表现了惊人的劳动热忱，创造了各种英雄事迹。总之立三同志指出今后在发展生产方面还有不少困难，而战胜困难的唯一可靠办法便是“依靠群众”，因而他对公营企业管理民主化问题，依据陈云同志报告中的原则和办法加以阐明后，提出各解放区公营企业应立即着手选择重点，试行组织工厂管理委员会，并在五百人以上的较大企业中建立职工代表会议，由厂长，技术人员和职工代表组织管理委员会，厂长应有最后决定权，如遇紧急事件，厂长得先行处理，再提交管理委员会批准；遇有厂长意见与大多数委员意见矛盾时，首先按厂长意见执行，同时报告上级请示。立三同志归纳工厂管理委员会和职工代表会议的四个作用即：（一）团结全体职工，通力合作，发展生产。（二）把职工是企业主人翁的原则在组织上表现出来，提高职工劳动积极性、纪律自觉性和对生产的责任心。（三）发扬批评与自我批评，克服官僚主义。（四）培养职工管理生产的能力。他提议委托全国总工会执委会研究制订有关工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议的详细条例。接着，他对于企业化问题作了简单的说明，提出作到企业化的九个条件：（一）严密的生产计划；（二）严密的经济核算制；（三）任人行政与工资制度应以经营能力、技术知识、熟练程度、劳动态度为标准；（四）严格的考工制度；（五）合理的劳动条件；（六）适合于科学的管理原则的合理的组织机构；（七）严格的专责制；（八）劳动纪律和赏罚制度；（九）实行劳动检查，成品检验。此外他对各代表团提出的各种疑问和具体问题，如工资制度、工作时间、休假问题、童工年龄限制、劳动契约之必要、劳动保险等项都一一作了说明。他对工作时间问题指出只有在小企业或店铺暂时不能缩短工作时间的，以及须昼夜开班，一贯实行两班制的大企业，可暂行十二小时，其他则应定为八小时至十小时。\n    立三同志总结毕，大会一致通过了中国职工运动当前任务的决议，并交付全国总工会执委会作文字上的修改然后公布。关于中华全国总工会章程，立三同志对各代表在讨论中提出了怀疑或不同意的几个问题，亦作了详尽解释，并获得大会通过，交执委会作文字上的修改。"

Soviet representative Major General Kislenko delivered a speech stating that on July 22nd, MacArthur sent a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, requesting the immediate revision of the \"Civil Service Law\" passed by the Japanese Parliament on October 16, 1947, and demanding the enactment of laws prohibiting government employees from striking and collectively bargaining with the government. On July 31st of this year, the Japanese government, following MacArthur's letter, promulgated a special decree prohibiting government employees and public institution employees from engaging in collective bargaining and strikes, and all previously concluded collective contracts were also canceled by the same decree. The aforementioned decree took effect immediately after its promulgation, and the Japanese government launched a widespread suppression movement against government employees based on this. Not only that, but the American occupation authorities also directly participated in the suppression of Japanese workers; the Toho Film Company incident on August 19th of this year is one example. All of the above proves that the American occupation authorities and the Japanese government have violated the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's political decisions regarding the basic policy towards Japan after surrender and the principles of Japanese trade union organization. In view of this, Kislenko suggested that MacArthur should abolish his directive to the Japanese government and cancel the decree promulgated by the Japanese government, thereby ending the suppression of government agency employees.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 盟国对日委员会特别会议上  苏方代表发表演说要求终止镇压职工\n\n1948-09-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　盟国对日委员会特别会议上\n    苏方代表发表演说要求终止镇压职工\n    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：盟国对日委员会于八月廿八日举行特别会议，苏联代表基斯连科少将发表演说称，七月廿二日，麦克阿瑟曾致函日政府首相芦田均，要求立即修改日本议会一九四七年十月十六日所通过的“公务员法”，并要求制定禁止政府职工罢工及与政府集体议价的法律。今年七月卅一日，日本政府依从麦克阿瑟的信函颁布了一项特别法令，禁止政府职工及公共机关职工进行集体议价与罢工，从前所订的一切集体合同也被同一法令取消。上述法令颁布后立即生效，日本政府并据此对政府职工发动了广泛的镇压运动。不仅如此，美国占领当局亦直接参加了对日本职工的镇压，今年八月十九日东宝影片公司的事件即其一例。上述一切，证明美国占领当局及日本政府违犯了波茨顿宣言及远东委员会关于对投降后日本之基本政策及日本工会组织原则之政治决定。有鉴于此，基斯连科建议麦克阿瑟应废除他对日本政府的指令，并取消日本政府颁布的法令，从而终止对政府机关职工的镇压。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Reports from various sources indicate that the people's armed forces under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party (BCP) are actively operating in central Burma. The BCP armed forces have repeatedly cut off the Rangoon-Mandalay railway line that runs north-south through Burma; fierce fighting also broke out in Toungoo District and Pegu, where the BCP forces are strong, on August 30th. In the west, some important cities along the Irrawaddy River have become battlefields. A Reuters dispatch on the 1st stated that the transportation hub of Prome is still occupied by the BCP forces; Sagaingmyo, a well-known cement manufacturing center, was also occupied by the BCP forces on August 10th. On September 1st, battles also took place between the BCP army and the reactionary government army in Shwezayan, northwest of Mandalay, and in Monywa on August 30th. The BCP army is very active in the Irrawaddy Delta and near Bassein. Moreover, according to the Associated Press, a \"rebellion\" broke out in the Karenni hills northeast of Toungoo on August 26th. At the same time, armed forces defecting from the volunteer army are operating in western and southern Burma. Sagaingmyo was also briefly occupied by this unit on the 22nd. Kyauktan northeast of Rangoon, Thanlyin to the southeast, Syriam, Burma's largest oil depot three miles from Rangoon, Dala one mile from Rangoon, and Hmawbi to the north have all been occupied by mutinous volunteer forces opposing Thakin Nu.\n  Such widespread armed struggle has alarmed the British and American imperialists, the masters of the Burmese government. The Manchester Guardian, representing the interests of the British big bourgeoisie, published an article on August 17th, anxiously demanding that the British government openly step forward to suppress the Burmese people with armed force. The newspaper stated: \"As far as Britain is concerned, we can better assist Burma by setting an example than by giving admonitions. This example is to resolutely and effectively implement military actions appropriate to the situation, as in Malaya.\" The American imperialists have also eagerly taken measures to interfere in Burma's internal affairs. According to a United Press reporter on August 24th, the United States has agreed to the British transfer of leased materials from the Middle East to the Burmese government. American officials also emphasized that the British government should hold direct negotiations with the Burmese government on military assistance.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 缅共领导下的人民武装　接连切断主要铁路线　交通中心普罗姆仍为缅共所占领\n\n1948-09-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　缅共领导下的人民武装\n  　接连切断主要铁路线\n  　交通中心普罗姆仍为缅共所占领\n    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：缅共领导下的人民武装正积极活动于缅甸的中部。缅共武装曾接连切断纵贯缅甸南北的仰光至曼德勒的铁路线；而缅共力量强大的倘古区及庇古，八月卅日亦发生激战。在西部，沿伊洛瓦底江的一些重要城市已成为战场。路透社一日消息称，交通中心的普罗姆仍为缅共部队所占领；著名的水泥制造中心萨页谬，八月十日亦曾为缅共部队占领。本月一日在曼德勒西北的舒砂及八月卅日在蒙尼亚，缅共军与反动政府军亦均有战斗。伊洛瓦底江三角洲及巴森附近，缅共军很活跃。不仅如此，据美联社称，在倘古东北的卡伦尼山地，八月二十六日也爆发了“叛乱”。同时由志愿军哗变出来的武装，正在缅甸西部及南部活动。萨页谬于二十二日，也一度为这方面活动中的该部武装所占领。仰光东北的开阳，东南的丹瓦，距仰光三哩的缅甸最大油库锡库，和距仰光一哩的达拉以及北面的茂比，都曾为反抗达钦努的志愿军哗变部队所占领。\n    如此广泛的武装斗争，使缅甸政府的主子英美帝国主义惊惶失措。代表英国大资产阶级利益的曼彻斯特卫报于八月十七日著论，焦急的要求英政府公开出面武装镇压缅甸人民。该报称：“就英国而论，我们采取以身作则的方式，较诸告诫方式将能更有助于缅甸，这种以身作则，就是与在马来亚一样，坚决而有效地施行与情势相适应的军事行动”。美帝国主义者亦急切地采取了干涉缅甸内政的措施。据合众社记者八月二十四日透露，美国已同意英方以英国在中东的租借物资转交缅甸政府。美国官员并强调英政府应与缅甸政府举行关于军事援助的直接谈判。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: TASS, August 31st: The General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, Pessi, recently delivered a report at the Eighth Congress of the Finnish Communist Party. Pessi first pointed out the economic situation in Finland, stating: The working people have achieved significant results in restoring the war-ravaged economy. Finnish industrial production has reached 85 to 90 percent of pre-war levels. The Communist Party fights for the vital needs of the working people, thus preventing price increases. These achievements could have been much greater without the opposition of the Social Democratic Party. Pessi pointed out: The upcoming economic crisis in capitalist countries will inevitably affect the Finnish economy. Therefore, Finland must trade with countries that do not have such crises, namely the Soviet Union and the people's democracies of Eastern Europe. Regarding the political situation in Finland, Pessi stated: In the recent elections, the reactionaries failed to defeat the people's democratic forces, and the Finnish People's Democratic League remains one of the three major parties in parliament. Communists have been excluded from the government because the reactionary bourgeoisie wants to abolish the foreign and domestic policies insisted upon by the Communist Party. Their aim is to purge democratic elements from government agencies, transform Finland into a police state like before the war, and restrict the political rights of workers and ordinary civil liberties. Pessi finally pointed out that the main tasks of the Finnish Communist Party at present are: to maintain the friendship between Finland and the Soviet Union, to ensure unconditional compliance with the peace treaty and the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between Finland and the Soviet Union; to completely eradicate the remnants of fascism, to nationalize the large industries, commerce, banks, and insurance companies controlled by monopoly capital; to implement democratic land reform, and to fight for improving the living standards of the working people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 芬共第八次代表大会上　总书记贝西作报告号召维护苏芬友谊\n\n1948-09-09\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　芬共第八次代表大会上\n    总书记贝西作报告号召维护苏芬友谊\n    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社八月三十一日讯：芬兰共产党总书记贝西顷在芬共第八次代表大会上作报告。贝西首先指出芬兰经济情况称：劳动人民在恢复为战争蹂躏的经济方面，获得了重大成绩，芬兰工业生产已达战前水平百分之八十五至九十。共产党为劳动人民的切身需要而奋斗，因而防止了物价的上涨，如果没有社会民主党的反对，这些成就还可以大得多。贝西指出：资本主义国家即将来临的经济危机必将影响芬兰的经济，因此，芬兰必须以没有这种危机的国家，就是苏联与东欧各人民民主国家为贸易对象。论及芬兰的政治形势时，贝西称：在最近的选举中，反动派并没有能打败人民民主力量，而且芬兰人民民主联盟依然是议会三大党之一、共产党人被排斥于政府之外，因为反动的资产阶级想废除共产党所坚持的对外对内政策，他们的目的是想肃清政府机关中的民主分子，变芬兰为战前那样的警察国家，限制工人的政治权利与普通的公民自由权利。贝西最后指出芬共目前的主要任务就是：维护芬苏两国的友谊，确保无条件遵守和约与芬苏友好合作互助条约：完全根绝法西斯残余，将独占资本所控制的大工业、商业、银行与保险公司收归国有；实现民主的土地改革，为提高劳动人民生活水平而斗争。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 6th: Reports from various sources indicate that after the US and British governments repeatedly declared that the establishment of a West German separatist government would not be delayed, the so-called West German \"Parliamentary Representative Conference\" was launched on September 1st in the city of Bonn (south of Cologne) in the British occupation zone, under the direction of the US, British, and French \"political advisors.\" A total of sixty-five representatives appointed by the state parliaments attended the conference, which was chaired by Adenauer, chairman of the Christian Democratic Party in the British occupation zone. The task of the conference is to draft a so-called \"West German National Constitution Draft\" for the West German puppet regime, which the London Six-Power Conference unilaterally decided to establish this autumn, so as to \"legitimize the division of Germany carried out under foreign orders\" (Berliner Zeitung). Lehman, leader of the German Socialist People's Party (i.e., the West German Communist Party) attending the meeting, proposed a motion at the opening meeting demanding the immediate dissolution of this conference, but it was rejected. The leading organ of the German Socialist People's Party also issued a statement strongly opposing this \"representative conference established in violation of the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions.\" The statement said: \"The establishment of the Parliamentary Representative Conference not only has nothing to do with the German people, but also violates the will of the vast majority of the German people. What the German people demand is nothing other than the convening of a National Assembly by the German people to formulate a constitution and establish a new democratic republic.

MacArthur and Japanese reactionaries had repeatedly expressed their \"welcome\" beforehand. According to Central News Agency reports, Zhang Qun, on the second day of his arrival in Japan (22nd), paid his respects to his master MacArthur at noon. On the afternoon of the 25th, he met with Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida and Vice Minister Aizawa. From the morning of the 26th, he successively met with the leaders of various Japanese reactionary parties, including Ken Inukai, advisor to the Democratic Party, Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the National Cooperative Party, and Kijuro Shidehara of the Democratic Liberal Party. On the 31st, he paid a second visit to MacArthur at noon, holding talks for two hours. Late at night, he also met with Tetsu Katayama, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Zhang Qun repeatedly stated that his ugly behavior of colluding with MacArthur and the Japanese reactionaries was a \"private inspection,\" but it is widely rumored that Zhang Qun's main purpose in visiting Japan is to further betray national independence and, under MacArthur's command, form a so-called \"Sino-Japanese-Korean Anti-Communist Alliance.\" In addition to visiting Japan, Zhang Qun will also go to Korea and other places. Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 12th of last month, reported: \"Well-informed sources announced that 'Zhang Qun's main purpose for this trip is to pave the way for the Sino-Japanese reconciliation and joint anti-communism of Asian countries that he advocates.'\" Reuters, Nanjing, 12th, further quoted a conversation from an \"anonymous senior government official\" revealing that Zhang Qun's trip was to plan an \"anti-communist alliance\" or a so-called \"regional group security.\" Associated Press, Shanghai, 9th of last month, reported that Zhang Qun's visit to Japan was \"ordered\" by the bandit Chiang. According to TASS, Nanjing, 29th of last month: when Zhang Qun held talks with MacArthur and representatives of the Japanese reactionary camp in Japan, \"South Korean reactionaries also participated in these negotiations.

After in-depth mobilization, concrete plans were made. For example, at the meeting of branch committee members and cadres of the Third Joint Defense Village in the First District, Li, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, guaranteed to take the lead in cutting 20,000 catties of artemisia. Plans were made in Pang Village, Yujing, Suzhuang, and Pu Village. After returning to the village, they all actively took action. Pang Village held a branch meeting on the 19th to mobilize and organize. Party members and cadres first took the lead and accumulated fertilizer. Shen Shuifa, chairman of the Donghao Farmers' Association, mobilized his family of six to go to the fields and cut 3,000 catties of thorns. This mobilized the masses to cut thorns and artemisia, compost dregs, pen sheep, buy sesame cakes, carry manure, dig wild manure, and carry night soil everywhere. Niu Tuhai of Pang Village locked the door and his whole family cut artemisia, cutting more than 300 catties in one day. Cui Hugen, an old man from Silibei'ao Village, who is over fifty years old, also rushed to cut artemisia, cutting more than 2,000 catties in three days. Shen Fenglian, the village chief of Dongying Village, said, \"The wheat we planted last year yielded one stone per mu. Everyone said our wheat was good because we applied a lot of fertilizer. This year we want to plant six mu of stubble wheat, and we have already purchased 300 catties of sesame cakes, ready to put 300 dan of thatch fertilizer on the ground, so the seedlings will not dare to not grow well for me.\" Due to the vigorous and enthusiastic movement, many people changed their original wheat planting plans and wanted to plant more. Dongying, Tang'an and other villages in the Third District plan to plant 134 mu more wheat. Jueshan Village in the Second District plans to plant more than 90 mu of wheat.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, September 7th: The news undertakings in the Northeast Liberated Areas, after three years of vigorous efforts, have laid the foundation for further development. Currently, in addition to the Northeast Daily, which serves the entire region, there are more than ten major newspapers in the region, including the New Heilongjiang Daily, the Hejiang Daily, the Nenjiang New Daily, the Andong Daily, the Southern Liaoning Daily, the Victory Daily of Liaobei Province, the Masses Daily of the Hebei-Chahar-Jehol Border Region, and the Eastern Hebei Daily. In addition, there is the Inner Mongolia Daily, as well as more than ten private newspapers in Harbin, such as the Dazhong Daily, the Gongshang Daily, the Shenghuo Bao, the Wenhua Bao, and the Wu Bao. Each special district and larger county also publishes small newspapers. In addition to the Self-Defense Daily of the Political Department of the Northeast Military Region and the Logistics Daily of the Political Department of the Logistics Department, various field corps and rear military regions also publish newspapers in various forms. Major enterprise departments such as postal and telecommunications and railways also publish specialized small newspapers.\n\n　　The Northeast Daily currently has a daily circulation of over 70,000 copies, covering all parts of the Northeast Liberated Areas. In mid-August, after the newspaper's printing plant installed a power rotary press, it can print 80,000 to 100,000 copies per hour, providing excellent conditions for expanding the circulation volume. The circulation of other provincial-level newspapers is also around 20,000 copies. Due to the convenient and developed railways and highways in Northeast China, and the developed modern paper industry, newspapers have sufficient paper, and distribution is extremely fast. Major cities can see the newspapers on the same day or the next day, and other remote towns and villages can see the newspapers within a week at the latest.\n\n　　According to incomplete statistics, there are 500 reporters and editors in the news work force in various places. All newspapers have a large number of local, urban, and military special reporters and correspondents. The Northeast Daily currently has more than 150 regularly contributing special reporters, and the Andong Daily has more than 3,200 worker-peasant correspondents, which has played a significant role in the newspaper's work.\n\n　　Among the magazines, \"Knowledge,\" \"Northeast Literature and Art,\" \"Northeast Pictorial,\" and \"Emancipated Happiness\" have the widest sales. \"Emancipated Happiness\" is a popular publication loved by the vast number of farmers, with a circulation of 50,000 copies per issue. \"Northeast Pictorial\" is very popular among front-line soldiers, with a circulation of over 30,000 copies per issue.\n\n　　The news agencies include the Northeast General Branch of the Xinhua News Agency and three branches in Hebei-Chahar-Jehol, Andong, and Southern Liaoning, a front-line branch, and nineteen sub-branches. The branches in Heilongjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia are currently being prepared for establishment and restoration.\n\n　　There are currently eight Xinhua Broadcasting Stations in Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jilin, Jiamusi, Andong, Hejiang, and Yanji. Among them, the Harbin Xinhua Broadcasting Station is the largest, and can be heard throughout the country and Southeast Asia (the station's call sign is XNMK, the wavelength is 42 meters shortwave, 7100 kilocycles, with programs from 11:25 to 13:30 in the afternoon, and 18:55 to 23:30 at night). In addition to relaying important news and other programs from the Xinhua News Agency headquarters, the Northeast stations also have joint broadcasts of news from the Northeast Liberated Areas throughout Northeast China.\n\n　　In the past two years, newspapers and news agencies in the Northeast Liberated Areas have had some deviations in their reporting work, especially in the reporting of the land redistribution movement, where they made relatively serious \"leftist\" errors. But on the whole, they have made great achievements in publicizing the revolutionary war, publicizing the party's policies and guidelines, and reflecting the situation and exchanging experiences. Especially after the anti-\"Ke Li Kong\" movement last year, news workers in various places have been able to be more realistic and pay more attention to the study and mastery of the Party's various policies. Since this year, led by the Northeast Daily, they have more strictly promoted the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers, making the newspapers a powerful tool for implementing policies and promoting work. The prestige of the newspapers has therefore increased day by day. The Northeast Daily currently receives over a thousand letters from readers every month, inquiring about policies, daily life issues, and criticisms and suggestions for the newspaper. The newspaper publishes and answers these letters with considerable space, showing that the newspaper has continuously strengthened its ties with the masses.

The first batch of immigrants has now been properly settled and has begun to reclaim wasteland. When the Lin County government began to carry out this work, it first sent people to Bo'ai County to make contact and identify suitable houses and land, and then mobilized immigrants. It was planned to move a batch first, gain experience, and then continue to move people after autumn. Because the first batch of immigrants was eager to rush to plant late seedlings, the time was relatively short. Twenty-four poor households from the first, second, fourth, and fifth districts were mobilized first, with one person from each household going to settle down, led by county and district cadres, and they set off last month. The Special Commissioner's Office issued 30 jin of millet per person as travel expenses, and reception stations were set up along the way, with Lin and Bo'ai counties responsible for solving the living difficulties of the immigrants on the road in stages. When they arrived at the Xiasuimo Immigrant Distribution Office in Bo'ai, the local county and district cadres warmly received them, and the accommodation was in tile-roofed houses. The county governments of both sides also sent special personnel to solve the problems of land, farm tools, and utensils for the immigrant households. The Bo'ai branch of the Jinnan Bank loaned the immigrants 350,000 yuan to buy two large cattle. The Bo'ai County government lent each person 120 jin of wheat and 300 jin of seeds. With the problems of living and production basically solved satisfactorily, the immigrants immediately went into production. Each person planted two mu of autumn seedlings, which have now been hoed. It is planned to reclaim another 290 mu of wasteland, ensuring that it will be plowed and sown with wheat this year as soon as possible. After planting the autumn land, some people engaged in sideline production, carrying goods back to Lin County to sell, and visiting relatives and friends in their hometown. The villagers enthusiastically inquired about the situation in the immigrant area. When they heard that the land in Bo'ai was irrigated land and the houses were large tile-roofed houses, and that it was no problem to become rich as long as they worked hard, they all said, \"The current government is really doing everything for the masses.\" Many people are willing to move there as soon as possible. Seven peasant households in Wangzhi Village were helped by the government to move to Bo'ai on the 5th of this month.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 事先找好房地事后解决困难　政府帮助林县移民\n\n1948-09-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　事先找好房地事后解决困难\n  　政府帮助林县移民\n    【太行电】太行行署为了调剂人民生活，提高社会生产力，特决定从人多地少的五专区林县，分批移民到被敌长期摧残后人少地荒的四专区博爱县。第一批移民现已妥为安置，开始开生荒。林县县府在开始进行这一工作时，先派人到博爱接洽，看好房子土地，然后动员移民。准备先移一批，取得经验，秋后再陆续迁移。第一批移民因急于赶种晚苗，时间比较仓促，先在一、二、四、五区动员了较穷苦的二十四户，每户先去一人安置，由县区干部带领，在上月动身。专署发给每人小米三十斤作为路费，沿路并设有招待站，由林、博两县分段负责，解决移民在路上的生活困难。到达博爱下水磨移民分配处时，当地县区干部热情招待，安顿的住处都是瓦房。双方县府又派专人解决了移民户的土地、农具、用具等问题。冀南银行博爱支行贷给移民三十五万元，买了大牛两头。博爱县府每人借给麦子一百二十斤，又借出种子三百斤。生活和生产问题大致完满解决，移民立即进入生产。每人种了二亩秋苗，现已锄好。计划再开种荒地二百九十亩，保证最近开完犁好，今年种上麦子。有一部分人种好秋地，又搞起副业生产，担上货物贩回林县来卖，捎带着看老家的亲邻朋友。乡亲们热心询问移民地的情形，听说移到博爱种的是水浇地，住的是大瓦房，只要劳动生产，发家致富是不成问题时，都说：“现在的政府真是为群众为到底了。”有很多人都愿早些移去。王掷庄七户农民，又在本月五日由政府帮助移往博爱。"

    "content": "Jinnan Administrative Office Agricultural Department Instructs Each Special County to Seize the Opportunity to Lead Seed Selection\n\n[Jinnan Electric] The Agricultural Department of the Jinnan Administrative Office instructed each special and county to actively lead the masses in seed selection during the autumn harvest season. It pointed out that selecting superior varieties is one of the concrete methods to improve agricultural production. As the saying goes, \"A strong mother produces a fat son,\" which is a very practical and scientific principle. The Yulinbai wheat from the Shifosi area of ​​Linqing, as proven over the years, yields 20 to 30 jin more per mu than ordinary wheat, regardless of where it is planted. If seeds are not selected and the seeds are mixed, the crops in a field will not mature at the same time. Harvesting according to the early-maturing ones will inevitably result in low yields, and harvesting according to the late-maturing ones will definitely suffer losses. For example, one family in Shichangtun, Linqing, had very mixed wheat seeds and uneven maturity, resulting in reduced wheat yield. Uneven maturity will also affect the entire field's ability to catch up with the planting schedule.\n\nHow to select seeds and promote them? (1) Select and promote locally. Any superior variety recognized by the local masses should be selected and then promoted to the masses. Introduce the advantages of this variety, planting methods, and management techniques. This is easy for the masses to become familiar with and master, and the masses are also more likely to accept it. (2) Before selecting seeds, you should go to the field to observe in detail to see which seeds are good. After selecting the seeds, they should be harvested, threshed, and stored separately to maintain the purity of the seeds. What are superior varieties? The following are introduced for reference: (1) Millet: The grains are moderate in size, the color is uniform, the grains are round and thick-skinned, the ears are heavy, the grains are small, the ears are dense, the awns are stiff and long, the stalks are upright, there are many tillers, and there are no diseases such as \"empty grains,\" \"black mold,\" \"exposed heart,\" or \"burnt heart.\" According to the results of experiments conducted at the Linqing Farm last year, \"811\" millet yielded 15 jin more per mu than the locally recognized best \"Goose Feather White\" millet under the same cultivation conditions, and yielded half a jin more rice per hundred jin of millet. The same results were obtained in the trial planting at the Yulin Farm. This proves that \"811\" millet is suitable for the soil and climate of Jinnan and should be continuously promoted. (2) Cotton: The plants are strong, the fruit branches are long, the cotton bolls are numerous and large, the cotton opens early, the lint is clean and white, the fiber is fine and long, and it has luster. \"S-character cotton\" is a new foreign variety, and the yield is very good according to the Linqing Farm's experiment. (3) Corn (maize): The grains are plump, the color is uniform, the skin is thick, the ears are long, the cob (ear axis) is thin, there are no insects in the cob, the head and tail are about the same thickness, the grains are full at the ear end, the whole ear has seventeen or eighteen rows of grains, the rows are straight, the grains are arranged neatly, there is no black mold disease, and it matures early. (4) Sorghum: The stalks are thick and long, upright, the ears are heavy, the grains are large, the outer shell cap is small, and it does not grow red spores or black mold. (5) Drought-resistant and famine-preparedness seeds: This year, the region has suffered severe floods, and special attention should be paid to selecting and storing early-maturing and early-harvesting seeds that can enable the masses to have an early harvest next spring and prevent spring drought. For example, \"60-day return to granary\" small yellow millet, small jade corn, small mung beans, and broomcorn millet are excellent varieties that should be given special attention this year, which is of great significance for drought prevention and famine preparedness.\n\nThe specific tasks of each special and county in selecting and promoting superior varieties: The construction sections of each county under the jurisdiction of the First, Second, and Fourth Special Districts should earnestly be responsible for leading the masses to plant \"811\" millet. And according to the field block selection method, the \"811\" millet should be harvested and stored separately. The public sector will exchange 11 jin of public grain millet for 10 jin of \"811\" millet. When selecting \"811\" millet, the construction sections of each county should inquire in detail about the growth conditions, various characteristics, and the yield comparison with local general millet. It should be reported to the promotion section of this office in Linqing before the end of this month. The construction section of Xiajin and the promotion section of this office should conduct detailed inquiries and research on the \"S-character cotton\" experimental area in Xiajin and Linqing. In order to maintain the purity of the seeds, the agricultural supply cooperative of this office specially purchases \"S-character cotton\" in Linqing City and stores the cotton seeds itself. The seed processing in Xiajin is organized and managed by the government to prepare for large-scale promotion next year. Varieties of millet, cotton, corn, sorghum, beans, etc., that are recognized by the masses as good varieties should be selected, stored, and promoted locally; if there are particularly good varieties, the seed households, the masses, or cadres should report to this office. After inspection and visits by this office, if it is indeed a superior variety that needs to be widely promoted, this office will commend and reward it.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南行署农业处指示各专县　抓紧时机领导选种\n\n1948-09-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南行署农业处指示各专县\n  　抓紧时机领导选种\n    【冀南电】冀南行署农业处，指示各专、县抓紧秋收时机积极领导群众选种。指出：选择优良品种是农业生产提高一步的具体办法之一，俗话说：“母壮子肥”这是一个很实际科学的道理。临清石佛寺一带的鱼鳞白小麦，几年来的证明，不论在什么地种，都比一般小麦每亩多收二、三十斤。如果不选种，种子杂乱，一块地里庄稼不能同时熟，要按早熟的收割必然产量小，按晚熟的收割就必定受损失。如临清石长屯有一家麦种非常杂，成熟不齐，结果麦子减收。由于成熟期不齐，也会影响整个地的赶茬。\n    怎样进行选种及推广呢？（一）就地选就地推广。凡被当地群众公认的优良品种，经过选择再推广到群众中去。介绍该种的优点，种植方法，以及管理的技术等。这样易为群众熟悉掌握，群众也容易接受。（二）选种时事先应到地里详细观察，看那些种子好，选好后应单独收打和存放，保持种子纯粹。那些为优良品种？现介绍以下几种以供参考采用：（一）谷：籽粒适中，颜色一律，粒圆皮厚，穗头重，码子小，穗密，毛刚毛长，秆直立，分杼多，没有“糠谷老”“乌霉”“露心”“烧心”等病。“八一一”谷，去年在临清农场试验结果，在同样耕作条件下，比当地认为最好的“鹅翎白”谷每亩多产十五斤，每百斤谷多出斤半米。在鱼鳞农场试种，也得到同样结果。证明“八一一”谷适合于冀南土壤气候，应该继续推广。（二）棉花：棵强壮，果枝长、棉桃多而大，吐絮早，絮洁白，绒细长，有光泽。“斯字棉”是外来新品种，经临清农场试验，产量很好。（三）棒子（玉蜀黍）：籽粒饱满，颜色一律，皮厚，穗长，棒轴（穗轴）细，轴心里没虫子，头尾粗细差不多，籽粒长满穗端，全穗籽粒有十七八行，行直籽粒排列整齐，没有乌霉病，成熟早。（四）高粱：杆粗长，直立，穗重，籽粒大，外壳帽小，不长红斐和乌霉。（五）防旱备荒种子，今年本区水灾严重，应该特别注意选存早种早收能使群众明春早接口及防春旱的种子，象六十天还仓的小黄谷、小玉茭、小绿豆、黍子等忧良品种，在今年应特别注意选择，这对防旱备荒有重要意义。\n    各专、县选、推优良品种的具体任务：一、二、四专区所辖各县建设科，切实负责领导群众种“八一一”谷。并按田间块选办法，把“八一一”谷单收打和保存。公家用十一斤公粮谷换“八一一”谷十斤。各县建设科在选“八一一”谷时，应详细询明生长情况，各种特点，和当地一般谷的产量比较。务于本月底前呈报临清本处推广科。夏津建设科及本处推广科，对夏津临清“斯字棉”试验区作详细的询问和研究。为了保持种子的纯粹，本处农业供应社特在临清市收买临清“斯字棉”，自己轧存棉种。夏津轧种，由政府组织管理，以备明年大量推广。各地谷、棉、棒子、高粱、豆子等，被群众公认为好品种，应就地选存推广；如有特别好的，由种户及群众或干部向本处报告，经本处检查访问，如确系优良品种需要广泛推广的，本处予以表扬奖励。"

In Guancheng, there are more than 300 nitrate producing households in the city. From March 10th to June 19th, the Guancheng Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau provided loans of 500,000 yuan to support nitrate producers in developing production; it collected 21,000 jin of nitrate, valued at 1,200 yuan per jin, totaling 25.52 million yuan. In Puyang city, 118 people were boiling nitrate in November of last year, producing 3,560 jin per month. In March of this year, in order to strengthen leadership, the government established a city-wide nitrate boiling organization – the Nitrate Producers Committee – to promptly resolve difficulties for nitrate producers. It was determined that a portion of the nitrate price could be prepaid before collection to solve their funding difficulties, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of nitrate producers; nitrate boiling quickly developed. In April, the number of nitrate boiling households increased to 344 households, 440 people; production increased to 8,822 jin, of which first-class nitrate accounted for 95 percent and second-class nitrate accounted for 5 percent. In May, the number of nitrate boilers increased to 1,040 people, with a production of 17,568 jin, all of which was first-class nitrate in terms of quality. In order to develop nitrate and sulfur production, the Yanggu democratic government specifically established a Nitrate and Sulfur Bureau. This year, the bank branch provided loans of 275,000 yuan, and the Huafeng Store lent 2.35 million yuan to nitrate producers. As a result of the development of the nitrate industry, the number of nitrate producers increased from 136 households to 225 households. In the first half of this year, 56,766 jin of nitrate were produced. This spring, Nanle city produced 19,550 jin of boiled nitrate. To avoid nitrate producers suffering losses due to grain price fluctuations, it was decided that the nitrate price would be based on the grain price when the public collected nitrate. It has now increased from 900 yuan per jin to 1,300 yuan, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of nitrate producers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 加强领导及时解决困难　冀鲁豫硝业发展\n\n1948-09-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　加强领导及时解决困难\n  　冀鲁豫硝业发展\n    【冀鲁豫电】观城、濮阳、南乐、阳谷等地硝业，在民主政府大力扶植下迅速发展。观城城关共有硝户三百多户，从三月十日到六月十九日一百天中，观城硝磺局曾贷款五十万元扶植硝民发展生产；收硝两万一千斤，每斤按一千二百元计算，共值二千五百二十万元。濮阳城关去年十一月份共有一百一十八人熬硝，每月生产三千五百六十斤。今年三月政府为加强领导，成立了全城的熬硝组织——硝民委员会，及时解决硝民困难，确定收硝前可预支一部硝价，解决他们的资金困难，硝民生产情绪更加提高；熬硝迅速发展起来。四月份熬硝户增至三百四十四户，四百四十人；产量增至八千八百二十二斤，其中头等硝占百分之九十五，二等硝占百分之五。五月份熬硝者增至一千零四十人，产量达一万七千五百六十八斤，在质量上均变为头等硝。阳谷民主政府为了发展硝磺生产，专门设立了硝磺局，今年银行支行曾贷款二十七万五千元，华丰商店借给硝民二百三十五万元。硝业发展，硝民由一百三十六户增到二百廿五户。今年上半年产硝五万六千七百六十六斤。南乐城区今春熬硝一万九千五百五十斤。为避免粮价变动时硝民吃亏，公家收硝时决定硝价按粮价定，现已由九百元一斤，增至一千三百元，硝民生产情绪极高。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 7th: At the closing ceremony of the Sixth National Labor Congress, General Lin Biao delivered a speech on behalf of the Northeast Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party. He said: \"The participants in this conference include not only representatives from all liberated areas, but also representatives from the China Labor Association and representatives of workers from major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This signifies a unity of the working class with significant historical importance. This conference is taking place in an era when the people's revolutionary war is achieving great victories. Currently, China is undergoing an unprecedented people's revolutionary war in its history. It is because of the hatred accumulated by the people from thousands of years of oppression, the accumulated experience, and the accumulated courage and strength that the people can wage such a massive war of liberation. This war is the expression of various long-term people's struggles developing to their highest form, and it will fundamentally change China's history of thousands of years. Chinese history will move forward under the conscious guidance of the people's leading party – the Communist Party, and the leading class – the working class. The Chinese people's heroic struggle against the enemy has been numerous, long, and magnificent, but only this time has it reached an unprecedented scale; only this time, with the leadership of the working class, is there a guarantee of inevitable victory; and only this time is it being conducted with such a high degree of consciousness. Chiang Kai-shek, the chieftain of the Chinese civil war, and the reactionary feudalist bureaucratic capitalism, colluded with American imperialism, attempting to reduce the Chinese people to slaves of American imperialism. They thought their offensive could suppress the working class and democratic forces, and that their power was absolute. Of course, they have considerable strength, with a reactionary regime and army, and American imperialism as their backing. However, they are reactionary, regressive, and violate the people's will, so they are destined to suffer final defeat and destruction. With the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, their reactionary attempts cannot be realized! In the two years of war, they have not only failed to defeat the people, but have been defeated by the people. In the future, the Kuomintang reactionary group will accelerate towards complete collapse. Now, the Chinese working class should be more aware of the greatness of the struggle tasks and resolutely lead the struggle to the final victory. Therefore, the working class must first unite itself. History proves that if the people want liberation, there is no other way but unity; only unity can defeat the enemy.\" General Lin Biao then pointed out: \"In the liberated areas, workers have already become the masters of society and the state. In the future, they must further unite to participate in the current liberation struggle, support the war, and develop production. They must ensure that the quantity of weapons and ammunition produced is large and the quality is high; they must raise labor enthusiasm to the highest level, striving to work hard, study business, and improve their political level, preparing to be the leading class of the national regime.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Vigorously Promote Field Seed Selection\n\n　　\"A strong mother bears fat children,\" good seeds grow good crops. In crops everywhere, there are those with stiff stalks and strong wind resistance, those with strong drought resistance, and those with strong resistance to pests and diseases. For example, the \"72\" wheat has mild jaundice, and the 811 millet (i.e., Da Zimu millet) has long awns and is not afraid of wind erosion. A kind of \"Qi Si Wu\" sorghum is completely unafraid of fog. If we select seeds with stronger wind resistance, drought resistance, and pest and disease resistance, we can reduce many disasters. People often see that in a field of crops, some are ripe, while others are still green, and they grow at uneven heights, making cultivation and harvesting very inconvenient. If seed selection is done well, this situation can be avoided. Seed selection is usually done in the field. If the crops are taken home or to the threshing ground for selection, it is easy to see their yield and the size of the ears, but other things are difficult to determine.\n\n　　(1) What kind of seeds should be selected?\n\n　　Because the geology (i.e., soil texture), climate (temperature), the needs of the masses, and planting habits vary from region to region, such as some places that are constantly plagued by wind disasters, what the masses urgently need are seeds with strong wind resistance. Some places are arid nine years out of ten, and what they urgently need are drought-resistant seeds. Some places grow one or two crops a year. The standards for seed selection cannot be uniformly enforced. Therefore, the following standards are for reference only and serve as a general basis for seed selection: 1. Select those with high yield. In the same field, select the type of crop that yields the most. For example, in good waterlogged land, 811 millet can yield more than ordinary millet by one dou per mu. 2. Select those with good harvest quality. Select those with dense grains, plump and full kernels, and heavy weight. For example, in the Ping Mountain area of the North Yue District, along the Hutuo River, there is a type of corn called Da Jinhuang, which has bright color, solid kernels, tastes good, is heavy, and produces a lot of flour. It should be the object of our selection. 3. Select those with relatively stiff stalks. For example, in Tang County, there is a type of Da Niutui millet, which has very stiff stalks. This type of crop is not easily laid down and is not easily damaged. For example, near Lingshou City, there is a type of \"Qi Si Wu\" sorghum, which is not afraid of fog. 4. Select those with strong resistance to pests and diseases. 5. Select those with the same ears. When selecting seeds, it is important to recognize what the original seed ears look like and select ears of the same type. If they are mixed up, the purity of the variety cannot be maintained, and the yield will become lower and lower.\n\n　　(2) How to select?\n\n　　1. Pick ears in the field. When corn, sorghum, etc., are ripe, two days before harvesting, first go to the field to pick the seeds and bring them home, then dry them, thresh them, and store them separately as seeds. For example, when selecting corn seeds, select ears that are neither too low nor too high from the ground. Leave the same number of leaf roots for each ear, so that they will grow to the same height in the coming year. After leaving the corn, it can be stored with the husks for a few days before husking. After the ears are dried, rub off the kernels from the upper half of the cob and also rub off the kernels from the root, leaving only the middle section. The kernels from this section will grow uniformly, neatly, and vigorously. 2. Select by plot or section. Select a plot or a section in a large field with good harvest and stiff stalks, harvest it separately, thresh it, and store it separately as seeds. Small-eared crops such as millet, rice, sorghum, and foxtail millet can be handled in this way because they require more seeds. 3. Organize the masses to visit and exchange. This year, agricultural farms in various places have promoted some seeds among the masses (811, Bai May, etc.). When harvesting, the production leaders in various places should assign special personnel to be responsible for organizing experienced old farmers to visit in the form of old farmer symposiums, especially in well-connected market towns and cities. This method of seeing the actual effect with one's own eyes has a great effect. When the masses and old farmers recognize that this seed is good through visits, they will spontaneously start exchanging it. This exchange is a very good method of seed selection. 4. Pay attention to selecting good local seeds. Various regions have some good local seeds. The production leaders in various places should propose good seeds that are popular with the local masses on the spot and appropriately lead the masses to carry out exchanges. Because they are suitable for different regional soil qualities, climates, and needs, they are often easily accepted by the masses.\n\n　　Finally, gradually hand over the task of seed selection to the broad masses of women in practical work. One of the reasons why field seed selection has not been widely carried out despite years of advocacy is that the masses are busy with supporting the front and there is a lack of labor. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to gradually hand over this task to the broad masses of women in the future.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大力推动田间选种\n\n1948-09-10\n第1版()\n专栏：农业常识\n\n　　大力推动田间选种\n    “母壮儿肥”，种子好就能长好庄稼。各地庄稼里有秸秆硬，抗风力强的，有耐旱力强的，也有抵抗病虫害力量较强的，例如“七二”小麦生黄疸轻，八一一谷（即大孳母谷）穗头毛长，不怕风磨，有一种“气死雾”高粱完全不怕雾。如果我们挑选了抗风抗旱抗病虫害力量较强的种子，就可以减少许多灾害。人们时常看到一块地里的庄稼，有的熟老了，有的还正青，并且长得七高八低，使耕种收割很不方便，如果作好了选种工作，这种情形就可以避免。选种子通常是在地当中选，如果把庄稼拿到家里或场里选，除可以看出他收成好坏，穗头的大小外，其他都不易办到。\n    （一）选什么样的种子？\n    因为各个地区的地质（即土脉土性）、气候（天气的冷热）、群众的需要和种植的习惯不同，如有些地方不断的闹风灾，群众迫切需要的就是抗风力强的种子。有些地方十年九旱，他们所迫切需要的就是抗旱的种子。有些地方一年种一季或两季。选种标准，不能强求统一，因此下面所说的这些标准，只能供大家参考，作为选种的一般根据：一、选产量大的。在一样的地里，那一种庄稼打得多，就去选拔那一种。如八一一谷在好水地里，每亩就能比平常的大谷子多打一大斗多。二、选收成成色好的。粒子密的，个子肥满饱实的，分量重的，如北岳区平山一带滹沱河岸上有一种棒子名叫大金黄，色道鲜亮，粒子坚实，好吃，分量重，出面多，它就应当是我们选择的对象。三、选秸秆比较硬的。如唐县有一种大牛腿谷，秸秆就挺硬，这种庄稼不易铺倒，不易损害。如灵寿城附近有一种“气死雾”高粱，这种高粱就不怕下雾。四、选抗病虫害力量强的。五、选一样的穗。选种时应当认清原种是什么样的穗就还选什么样的穗。如果混乱了，就不能保持纯种，产量就会越来越低了。\n    （二）怎样选法呢？\n    一、到地里挑穗。当棒子高粱等长熟了，还未收割前两天，先到地里把种挑下收到家里，另晒另打另保存起来作种子。如选棒子种，应当选离地皮不低不高的穗，要留几个叶根的就一律留几个叶根的，这在来年也就会长的一般高。棒子留下后可以带皮存放几天再剥皮，穗子晒干了，把上半截小棒粒揉去，根部的粒子也揉去，只要当中的一段，这一段棒子粒种起来整齐、匀整、健壮。二、块选或片选。选一块或在大块地当中挑一片收成好，秸秆硬的庄稼，另收另打另外保存起来作种子。谷子、稻子、黍子、稷子等小穗庄稼，用种子较多的都可以这样办。三、组织群众参观互换。今年各地农场推广场，在群众中实际推广了一些种子（八一一、白马牙等），当收成时，我们各地的生产领导上应责成专人负责，就地以老农座谈会的形式组织有经验的老农参观，特别在四通八达的集镇和城市，这种亲眼见实效的参观方法作用很大，当通过参观、老农公认这种种子好时，就会自发的展开互换，这种互换是一种很好的选种方法。四、注意挑选本地的好种子。各个地区都有一些本地的好种子，我们各地的生产领导上应就地提出本地群众所欢迎的好种子，适当的领导群众展开互换。因适合不同地区的土质气候和需要，故往往很容易为群众所接受。\n    最后，在实际工作中把选种的任务逐步交给广大妇女。田间选种虽经多年提倡，至今还没有广泛搞起来的原因之一，就是群众的支前生产忙，劳力缺乏。因此，今后逐步的把这个任务交给广大的妇女，是完全必要的。"

    "title": "Anguo County Cadres Actively Lead, Free Grouping and Mutual Aid to Eliminate Insects",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-10",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Jizhong Electric] After pests were discovered in over fifty villages in the Third, Fourth, and Seventh Districts of Anguo County, cadres from each district immediately led the masses to actively capture and kill them. In mobilizing the masses and in the methods of capture, there were generally the following two types: (1) Organized and led implementation. For example, the Fourth District organized an insect-fighting command post, divided into three sub-districts, with one sub-district forming an insect-fighting brigade, and sub-district cadres serving as captains. Villagers freely combined to form insect-catching teams, with three teams forming a squad, and the entire village forming an insect-catching detachment, with village cadres serving as detachment leaders, squad leaders, and team leaders. The village branch educated party members to play a backbone role. For example, after armyworms were discovered in Beilou Village, the branch immediately held a branch meeting, calling on party members to actively catch insects. On the 19th, under the leadership of the branch, all 147 households in the village mobilized 548 people to catch insects, including 180 women. When catching insects, most villages had their own groups fight their own plots, but some groups that had finished their own plots also helped other groups, implementing mutual aid and labor exchange. Song Luokuan, from Beibao Village, had a very awkward temper. This time, he resolutely refused to join the mutual aid group to catch insects. Later, he had too many insects in his field to handle, so he automatically joined the group. Everyone helped him for a day, and more than half of the insects were killed. He happily said, \"I know now that organized mutual aid is powerful.\" (2) Using facts to break superstition. When armyworms were first discovered, some backward people said they were \"god insects\" that would \"leave after they had eaten enough\" and that \"the more you kill, the more there will be.\" Song Guanghe, from Songjia Village, burned paper money for the insects in his grain field, but the more he burned, the more insects there were. Seeing that his crops were about to be ruined, he anxiously said, \"I think it's better to beat them than to respect them!\" The whole family went to the field and managed to kill some of the insects. Li Laowen, from Nanbao Village, burned paper money for the insects. Later, seeing that others were killing fewer and fewer insects, while his field had more and more, he anxiously started beating them too. The leadership seized this fact and used the village blackboard newspapers and radio stations to publicize it, and many superstitious people stopped being superstitious. (3) Mobilizing women to participate in insect catching. Wang Ru, from Qudi Village, held a family meeting as soon as there were armyworms in her field, mobilizing all the women in the family to go to the field to kill insects, and the crops were not damaged. Beilou Village mobilized 180 women, and the Fifth Village of Chengguan mobilized 24 women. Female cadres such as Bu Yinxia took the lead in capturing and killing insects, influencing more than 20 women to go to the fields to capture and kill them. They all said, \"Look at them not being afraid of insects and not minding the dirt. What are we afraid of!\" Under the active leadership of the cadres and the capture and killing by the masses, the county's insect-catching work has achieved initial results. On the morning of the 17th, Liushuang Village in the Fourth District mobilized 320 people, organized 28 groups, and worked on 148 mu. In the afternoon, 415 people were mobilized, 34 groups, and 240 mu were worked on. On the 17th, Zhangzhuang Village mobilized 159 people, 13 groups, and worked on 173 mu. After one or two days of such organized capture and killing, the insects have been greatly reduced. Beiyang Village has reduced by three-quarters, and Beihuazhuang has reduced by two-thirds. According to the statistics of the Fourth District on the 17th, thirteen villages organized 291 insect-fighting groups, with a total of 2,749 people. According to the statistics of eleven villages, a total of 1,242 mu of insects were killed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安国各区村干部积极领导　自由结组互助灭虫\n\n1948-09-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安国各区村干部积极领导\n  　自由结组互助灭虫\n    【冀中电】安国三、四、七区五十来村，先后发现害虫后，各区干部立即领导群众积极捕打。在动员群众和捕打方法上，一般有以下两种：（一）有组织有领导的进行。如四区组织了一个打虫指挥所，下分三个小区，一个小区为一个打虫大队，小区干部当队长。各村群众自由结合组成捕虫小组，三个小组为一班，全村组成捕虫分队，村干部任分队长、班长和组长。村支部则教育了党员起骨干作用。象北楼村发现黏虫后，支部马上召开了支部会，号召党员积极捕虫。十九日，在支部领导下，全村一百四十七户，就发动了五百四十八人捕虫，其中妇女一百八十名。捕虫时，各村大都是自已组打自己组的，但有的组打没了自己的还帮助别组打，实行互助拨工。北堡村宋洛宽脾气挺蹩扭，这次打虫他坚决不参加互助组，后来他地里虫子太多拿不过来，才自动入了组，大家帮助他一天就把虫子打了多一半。他欢喜的说：“我可知道组织起来互助力量大了。”（二）用事实打破了迷信。开始发现黏虫时，有的落后群众说是“神虫”，“吃够了日子就走了”，“越打越多”。宋贾村宋广合的谷地里有了虫子，他却给虫子烧纸，可是越烧虫子越多，眼看庄稼快吃坏了。他才着急的说：“我看敬它不如打它！”全家都下地，才把虫打少了。南堡村李老文给虫子烧纸，后来见人家越打越少，他地里越来越多，他也着急的打起来。领导上抓住这个事实，利用各村黑板报、广播台进行宣传，好多迷信的群众才不迷信了。（三）发动妇女参加捕虫。曲堤村王汝与地里刚一有黏虫，就开了家庭会，动员了全家妇女下地打虫，庄稼没有受害。北楼村发动了一百八十名妇女，城关第五村发动了二十四名妇女。该村妇女干部卜银霞等四人带头捕打，影响的二十多个妇女也下地捕打。都说：“看人家不怕虫，不嫌脏，咱怕什么！”在干部积极领导群众捕打下，该县捕虫工作已获初步成绩。四区流双村十七日前半晌，就发动了三百二十人，组织二十八个小组，打了一百四十八亩。后半晌，发动了四百一十五人，三十四个组，打了二百四十亩。张庄村十七日发动群众一百五十九人，十三个组，打了一百七十三亩。这样有组织的捕打了一两天，虫子已大大减少。北洋村已减少四分之三，北化庄减少三分之二。据四区十七日一天统计，十三个村组织了二百九十一个打虫组，共二千七百四十九人。据十一个村统计，共打虫一千二百四十二亩。"

According to investigations, the bad systems of dark transactions and exploitation of both sellers and buyers in various markets in the past still exist seriously today. In the livestock trade, \"secret language\" is used to make deals. The traders change the ten numbers into: Ding One, Ci Two, Pin Three, etc., so that people who sell and buy livestock do not know the details, so as to make money from them. Grain and cotton traders also use secret codes to make the masses suffer losses. Cloth traders do not use a ruler to measure but casually use hand measurements. Other miscellaneous trades also make money in secret. For example, the Shatu Market traders secretly use pig and sheep fees. The main reasons for these problems are the legacy of the bad habits of the old society and the bureaucratic work style of industrial and commercial workers who do not conduct in-depth inspections and corrections. Recently, these ugly and dark secrets of exploitation were exposed at the trader's conference, and bad ones were criticized and educated, and a few very bad ones were suspended from their positions as traders. Active traders were mobilized to reflect on how they had let down the masses in the past, and secret codes were abolished. Standard scales and rulers were set up in each city and placed in the middle of each trade, allowing the masses to freely weigh and measure.

TASS reports: Moscow, the Soviet capital, bid a final farewell on the afternoon of the 2nd to the great citizen and patriot, and outstanding leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, Zhdanov. From 4 PM on the 1st, when Zhdanov's remains were placed in the Hall of Trade Unions, until 4 PM on the 2nd, half a million people had visited the hall to pay their respects. The line of people waiting outside the Hall of Trade Unions stretched for several kilometers. Ministers, representatives of the Supreme Soviet, labor heroes, Soviet heroes, outstanding scientists, writers, and artists took turns standing guard.\n\n　　At 5:20 PM on the 2nd, Stalin, Molotov, Beria, Voroshilov, Malenkov, and others took the final watch. Subsequently, Stalin and other party and government leaders carefully carried the coffin out of the Hall of Columns and placed it on a gun carriage, and the funeral procession proceeded towards Red Square. At the front of the procession was a long line of people carrying wreaths and holding the various medals and decorations Zhdanov had received during his lifetime, shining brightly against the scarlet backdrop. This was the great motherland's high praise for its excellent son. Red Square and its adjacent streets were filled with people from all over the country, and the troops stood in neat formations, waiting solemnly. When the procession reached Lenin's Mausoleum, Stalin and the party and government leaders carried the coffin off the gun carriage and placed it on a high platform, then ascended to the podium of Lenin's Mausoleum.\n\n　　At 6 PM, the memorial service began. Molotov first gave a eulogy on behalf of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Council of Ministers. He briefly described the life of the deceased, pointing out that \"Zhdanov was an outstanding Marxist theorist. His reports on literature, art, and philosophy were a major contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism. By pointing out new paths for our socialist culture and in many ways assisting in eliminating the shortcomings existing in these fields, he set an example of a Bolshevik leader who combined participation in daily construction work with a deep study of Marxist theoretical problems.\" Finally, Molotov bid farewell to Zhdanov with deep sorrow. Following him, Marshal Govorov, who had fought alongside Zhdanov in Leningrad, reported on the great leadership role he played in the Battle of Leningrad. After the speech by Popov, secretary of the Moscow Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and chairman of the funeral committee, the memorial service concluded.\n\n　　To the sound of a funeral march, Stalin and the party and government leaders lifted the coffin and carried it to the Kremlin wall, where it was buried in the cemetery of outstanding leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. At 6:40 PM, the national anthem was played, the coffin was lowered into the ground, and a three-volley salute was fired. The flag on the roof of the Supreme Soviet Building of the Soviet Union was slowly raised to the top of the pole, and the funeral came to an end. Stalin and the party and government leaders then re-ascended Lenin's Mausoleum and began to review the mighty Soviet army marching in formation. Millions of Muscovites marched in columns along with the army, and the eyes of the soldiers and working people were all fixed on the great Stalin. Under his leadership, the Soviet people are confidently marching towards new victories for communism.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 百万人民挤满红场　悲痛安葬日丹诺夫\n\n1948-09-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　百万人民挤满红场\n  　悲痛安葬日丹诺夫\n    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社报导：苏京莫斯科于二日下午最后送别伟大的公民与爱国者、布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家的杰出领袖日丹诺夫。自一日下午四时日丹诺夫遗体停放职工会大厦之时起，至二日下午四时之一昼夜间，已有五十万人民赴灵堂瞻仰日丹诺夫遗容，职工会大厦门外伫候的行列长达数公里。部长们、最高苏维埃代表们、劳动英雄们、苏联英雄们、杰出的科学家、作家、艺术家们，更番前往守灵。\n    二日下午五时二十分，由斯大林、莫洛托夫、贝利亚、伏罗希洛夫、马林科夫等最后守灵。随后，斯大林与党政领袖们谨慎地将灵柩抬出圆柱大厅，并安放在炮车上，出殡的行列即向红场进发。行列的前面是一长串的人群，他们抬着花圈，捧着日丹诺夫生前获得的各种勋章、奖章，在猩红的衬底上闪耀生光，这是伟大的祖国对其优秀儿子的崇高褒奖。红场及其毗邻的街道上挤满了来自全国各地的人民，军队排成划一的方阵，肃立伫候。当行列到达列宁墓前时，斯大林与党政领袖将灵柩抬出炮车，安置于高台上，旋即升至列宁墓讲台。\n    六时正，追悼会开始。莫洛托夫首先代表联共（布）中央与部长会议致辞。他简述了死者的生平，指出“日丹诺夫是出类拔萃的马克思主义理论家。他关于文学、艺术和哲学的报告，是对发展马列主义的重大贡献。由于指出了我国社会主义文化的新道路，并多方面助成了消除这些领域中存在着的缺点，他树立了参加每日建设工作和深刻研究马克思主义理论问题相结合的布尔什维克领袖之典范。”最后，莫洛托夫以深沉的悲哀向日丹诺夫告别。继之，曾与日丹诺夫在列宁格勒并肩作战的戈沃罗夫元帅，报告他在列宁格勒战役中所起的伟大领导作用。在联共（布）莫斯科党委书记、治丧委员会主席波波夫演讲后，追悼会遂告结束。\n    在葬仪进行曲声中，斯大林与党政领袖扶起灵柩，抬至克里姆林宫墙下安葬布尔什维克党与苏维埃国家杰出领袖之墓地。六时四十分，国歌高奏，灵柩下葬，排炮齐鸣三响，苏联最高苏维埃大厦屋顶的半旗即徐徐升至杆顶，葬仪至此结束。斯大林与党政领袖又重升列宁墓，开始检阅排成行列式前进的强大苏军，成百万的莫斯科市民随着军队列队前进，战士们与劳动人民的眼睛都注视着伟大的斯大林，苏维埃人民在他的领导下，满怀信心地朝着共产主义的新胜利前进。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: Moscow Radio broadcasted a Pravda commentary from the Soviet Union on August 30th regarding Zhang Qun's visit to Japan. The commentary cited numerous newspapers and news agencies to expose the conspiracy behind Zhang Qun's visit to Japan. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported: Zhang Qun's mission is to establish an anti-communist bloc, with Japan, China, and Korea forming an alliance, and Myanmar and Indonesia joining later. The Nanjing Ren Bao (People's Daily) stated even more definitively: The talk about the possible signing of a Sino-Japanese anti-communist alliance is not entirely unfounded rumor. The Nanjing Zhanwang (Outlook) magazine stated: According to well-informed sources, Zhang Qun's trip aims to organize an alliance between China, Japan, and Korea. The magazine pointed out that the real organizer of this alliance is the United States, writing: This is not a Chinese policy towards Japan, but an American policy towards China; this is not a Far Eastern alliance plan established by the Chinese Kuomintang, but a plan by the United States to establish something similar to the Western European Union. From the perspective of American \"military aid to China,\" this alliance is very convenient, because it can supply more munitions to the Kuomintang through Japan and Korea. This is best for the United States, as it can both make money and further interfere in China's internal affairs through this \"alliance.\" The magazine said: Chiang Kai-shek is willing to accept the U.S. plan for this East Asian alliance. Pravda, after citing these newspaper reports, pointed out: Another proof that the Kuomintang government wants to participate in this \"Far Eastern Alliance\" is its hasty recognition of the Seoul South Korean government, which is nothing more than a group of Korean traitors. Despite signing the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance, the Kuomintang government still wants to participate in the aforementioned Far Eastern Alliance. This action by the Kuomintang government has even caused considerable alarm in public opinion under Kuomintang rule. The newspaper also pointed out: The diplomatic activities of the United States in the Far East are obviously transplanting the experience of its monetary diplomacy from the West to the East. In the West, they are reviving German aggressive forces and establishing puppet governments in the West as the foundation of Western aggressive forces, sacrificing the interests of Western European countries—especially France—for this purpose. The situation in the Far East is exactly the same: they are reviving Japanese aggressive forces, primarily at the expense of China's interests, creating a state of enslavement for China similar to what Japanese imperialists did before. But Pravda finally clearly pointed out: This sinister plan is doomed to failure because neither the Chinese, Japanese, nor Korean people will accept this sinister plan produced by Wall Street's foreign policy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 真理报揭穿张群访日阴谋　美帝图组“远东同盟”进一步侵略中国中日韩人民必定坚决反对这种罪恶计划\n\n1948-09-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　真理报揭穿张群访日阴谋\n  　美帝图组“远东同盟”进一步侵略中国中日韩人民必定坚决反对这种罪恶计划\n    【新华社陕北七日电】莫斯科广播苏联真理报八月卅日关于张群访日的评论。该评论引证许多报纸和通讯社的消息，揭穿了张群访日的阴谋。法新社消息称：张群的使命是建立一个反共产主义集团，由日本、中国、朝鲜三国以同盟的形式出现，让缅甸和印度尼西亚以后加入。南京人报更肯定的说：关于可能签订中日反共产主义同盟，完全不是没有根据的空话。南京展望杂志则称：据消息灵通方面人士称：张群此行目的是组织中国、日本和朝鲜的同盟。该杂志指出这个同盟的真正组织者是美国，它写道：这并不是什么中国对日政策，而是美国对华政策，这并不是中国国民党成立的远东同盟计划，而是美国建立类似西欧联盟的那种计划。从美国“军事援华”的观点看来，这种同盟是非常方便的，方便的原因是可以经过日本和朝鲜供给更多的军火给国民党。这对于美国是再好不过了，这样既可赚钱，并且还可经过这个“同盟”更进一步干涉中国内政。该杂志说：蒋介石是愿意接受美国的这个东亚联盟计划的。真理报在引证了这些报纸消息后指出：国民党政府想参加这个“远东同盟”的另一证据，就是它匆匆忙忙地承认了汉城南韩政府，而这个所谓政府不过是朝鲜一群卖国贼而已。虽然签订了中苏同盟条约，但国民党政府还是想参加上述的远东同盟。国民党政府的这种行动，甚至已在国民党统治下的舆论中引起相当严重的恐慌。该报并指出：美国在远东的外交活动，很明显的是把金元外交政策的经验从西方搬到东方来了。在西方，他们复兴德国侵略势力，建立西部的傀儡政府，以此作为西方侵略势力的基础，并为此目的牺牲西欧各国——首先是法国——的利益。在远东的情势也完全是这样，他们复兴日本侵略势力，首先是牺牲中国的利益，为中国造成如从前日本帝国主义者所给他的一样的被奴役地位。但真理报最后明确指出：这种罪恶性质的计划是会破产的，因为无论是中国的、日本的或是朝鲜的人民，都不会接受华尔街的外交政策所产生出来的这种罪恶计划。"

    "content": "【Ji'zhong Telegraph】Since correcting the errors of infringing upon industry and commerce and revising industrial and commercial taxes, industry and commerce in the Ji'zhong Ninth Sub-district has become increasingly developed. During the land reform in the district, a total of 1,490 industrial and commercial households were infringed upon. After repeatedly implementing the Party's industrial and commercial policies and conducting in-depth explanations and education among cadres and the masses, the entire sub-district had corrected the issues for 1,235 households by June, with the remainder being corrected. At the same time, the shortcomings of excessively broad industrial and commercial tax burden or excessive burden were corrected. It was stipulated that the levy should not exceed 25% of net profit, and the share assessment was re-evaluated, changing the past erroneous practice of \"taking small businesses as the backbone to unite medium-sized businesses\" in the assessment of industrial and commercial taxes. Over-collected taxes were refunded. In order to prosper industry and commerce and facilitate the exchange of goods and materials, temple fairs were restored in various places. According to incomplete statistics from eleven counties, fifty temple fairs were restored. Among them, the trade volume of the An'guo temple fair alone reached 53 million yuan, with the Chinese medicine trade accounting for 24 million yuan. Local banks also issued loans and organized inter-bank transfers to vigorously support industrial and commercial households. For example, the An'guo City Bank supported 862 industrial and commercial households with loans. Among them, Fu Shun and Shuichepu, with the help of bank loans, obtained a net profit of 1 million yuan in three months and doubled their capital. Public factories and shops in various places also actively helped private industrial and commercial households develop. For example, the iron factory of the sub-district Industrial Corporation produced a large number of waterwheel parts for private factories. The Suning Pingyuan Iron Factory supplied raw materials and capital to private factories, which provided great convenience to industrial and commercial households.\n    (Editor's note: When providing loans, more should be lent to industry, and less or none to commerce, because industry produces social products; commerce does not produce products, but only completes commodity circulation. Therefore, industry should be valued over commerce. Undifferentiated lending to both industry and commerce is inappropriate.)\n    Under the multifaceted support of the democratic government, industry and commerce in the sub-district became increasingly developed. According to August statistics, among the 2,490 households that were infringed upon, after correcting the deviations and returning wrongly confiscated items, 1,235 households had resumed business. Many new industrial and commercial households were also added in various places. Dingxian County's industry increased from 111 households to 146 households, and commerce added 73 new households. Gaoyang County's industry increased from 86 households to 106 households. The Gaoyang weaving industry has gradually recovered. The number of looms has increased from 500 before the land reform to 3,033. The white paper making industry in Qiaoshangpu, Suning County, has increased to 200 households, producing more than five reams of paper per day. After the resumption of business, the nationally renowned Bai Jingyu Eye Medicine Shop in Dingxian County has found its products in short supply.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 端正政策整顿负担　冀中九分区工商业日益发展\n\n1948-09-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　端正政策整顿负担\n  　冀中九分区工商业日益发展\n    【冀中电】冀中九分区，自纠正侵犯工商业的错误及重订工商税以后，工商业日益发达。该区于土改中，共侵犯了一千四百九十户工商业。经过反复贯彻党的工商业政策，并在干部、群众中进行了深入的解释教育后，全分区到六月份已纠正了一千二百卅五户，其余正在继续纠正。同时纠正了工商税负担面太宽或负担过重的缺点，并规定征收不超过纯利百分之二十五，和重新评定了厘股，改变了过去“以小商为骨干团结中商”评议工商税的错误作法。对征收过重的实行了还补。为了繁荣工商业，便于物资交流，各地又恢复了庙会，据十一个县不完全统计，恢复庙会达五十个。其中只安国庙会交易额即达五万三千余万元，其中生药行占二万四千万元。各地银行并发放贷款、举办通支，大力扶植工商业户。如安国市银行以贷款扶植的工商户即有八百六十二户。其中在银行贷款帮助下的福顺与水车铺在三个月中得到纯利一百万元，并扩大资金两倍。各地公营工厂商店，也积极帮助私营工商户发展，如分区实业公司铁厂造出大批水车零件供给私人工厂。肃宁平原铁厂供给私营工厂原料、资本等，都给了工商户很大方便。\n    （编者按：贷款时应工业多贷，商业少贷或不贷，因工业生产社会产品的；商业不生产产品，只尽商品流通后，故对工业应重视商业。工商不分，平均贷给是不妥的。）\n    在民主政府多方扶植下，该分区工商业日益发达。据八月份统计，被侵犯的二千四百九十户中，经过纠正偏向，退回错斗东西后，已有一千二百三十五户复业，各地并新增不少工商户。定县工业由一百一十一户增到一百四十六户，商业新增加了七十三户。高阳工业由八十六户增到一百零六户。高阳织布业已逐渐恢复。织布机已由土改前五百张增至三千零三十三张。肃宁桥上铺白造纸业已增至二百户。每日出纸五余刀。定县全国驰名的白敬宇眼药铺厂复业后，所制成品供不应求。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th.\n\n　　A Victorious, United, and Forward-Looking Congress\n\n　　Zhu Xuefan Delivers Closing Remarks on Behalf of the Presidium\n\n　　The Labor Congress held its closing ceremony on August 22nd. Mr. Zhu Xuefan delivered the closing remarks on behalf of the Congress Presidium, calling the congress \"a victorious congress, a united congress, a forward-looking congress.\" Mr. Zhu stated that this congress was the first national unity that the working class across the country had looked forward to day and night for nineteen years, ever since the Fifth National Labor Congress was secretly convened in Shanghai in 1929, and had strived for at every moment. At the same time, the convening of this congress also occurred as the People's Liberation Army was victoriously advancing towards the areas ruled by the traitorous and corrupt Kuomintang reactionaries, just as the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its congratulatory message: \"This indicates that our people's liberation war under the leadership of the proletariat has reached its final victory, that a new national revolutionary period has arrived, and that the Kuomintang reactionary clique's policy of splitting the working class across the country has finally been declared bankrupt, and the national workers' movement has been reunited under the banner of revolution.\"\n\n　　He pointed out that the gains of this congress are limitless, precious, and great.\n\n　　First of all, through this congress, the working class across the country has a more correct and victorious direction in terms of understanding and future goals. This direction is that the working class across the country should first unite itself, and then unite with peasants, independent laborers, freelancers, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, and all patriotic elements to completely overthrow the rule of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary clique, and establish a new democratic people's democratic republic under the victorious banner of the Communist Party of China, the vanguard of the working class, and Comrade Mao Zedong.\n\n　　Secondly, the congress reinstated the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and elected formal and alternate executive committee members, forming the unified supreme leading organ of the mass organization of the working class in China. It unites 2.83 million workers in various enterprises in major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas to fight the final victorious struggle against American imperialism and its running dog, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in China, with unified steps. This organization—the All-China Federation of Trade Unions—is a powerful force in the democratic front of the world's working class against imperialism, anti-aggression, anti-oppression, and anti-split. Under the banner of the World Federation of Trade Unions, it will strive for the democratic, peaceful, united, and unified direction of the world's trade union movement and wage an irreconcilable struggle against the reactionary camp headed by American imperialism, especially against the conspiracy to split the world's trade union movement by means of the \"Marshall Plan.\"\n\n　　Thirdly, the congress listened to the reports on the labor movement and work reports from various regions and carefully studied issues such as working hours, wages, and workers' welfare, and made specific provisions in the current task resolution. These are things that the working class in China had struggled for for decades in the old society without achieving, but were victoriously resolved at this congress.\n\n　　At the same time, after hearing the reports on the labor movement and workers' lives in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the congress unanimously passed the \"Resolution on the Report on the Labor Movement in the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas\" and decided that workers in various liberated areas should volunteer one day of work to support their struggle. As soon as this resolution was announced, workers in various parts of Northeast China immediately responded and have already donated tens of millions of yuan (Northeast currency). This shows that the struggle of the worker comrades in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is not isolated. They have the support of 2.83 million members of the unified and united All-China Federation of Trade Unions as their backing, and their liberation struggle will surely achieve victory more quickly.\n\n　　Finally, the congress unanimously supported convening a revolutionary new political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries, and advocated that it be convened by the Communist Party of China, thereby establishing a revolutionary coalition government.\n\n　　Mr. Zhu stated: \"Now the time has come: the democratic forces of the world are rising, and the liberation of the Chinese people is approaching final victory. Whoever wants to carry out imperialist aggression, whoever wants to carry out reactionary rule, will suffer destruction under the blow of the democratic forces. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions must lead and urge the working class in the liberated areas to increase production and support the front lines, and lead and urge the working class in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to continue their heroic struggle, prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army, and liberate all of China. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions must, based on the glorious tradition of the working class struggle during the 'February 7th', 'May 30th', 'Guangdong-Hong Kong Strike', the three uprisings in Shanghai, and the First Great Revolution, and the spirit of the heroic figures in the struggle such as Lin Xiangqian, Shi Yang, Liu Hua, Wang Shouhua, Su Zhaozheng, Deng Zhongxia, Luo Dengxian, Deng Fa and other comrades, complete the great revolutionary cause. After the representatives return to their posts, they must use the greatest determination and flexible methods to complete the various tasks assigned to us by the congress; when each of us has done our due strength, our complete liberation will be achieved very quickly.\"\n\n　　Finally, on behalf of the Congress, he expressed his gratitude to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the domestic and foreign working class and democratic groups, and the various spiritual encouragement and material condolences given to the Labor Congress by the Party, government, military and people of the Northeast Liberated Area and various organizations.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 胜利、团结、前进的大会　朱学范代表主席团致闭幕词\n\n1948-09-10\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　胜利、团结、前进的大会\n  　朱学范代表主席团致闭幕词\n    【新华社东北七日电】劳动大会于上月二十二日举行闭幕典礼，朱学范氏代表大会主席团致闭幕词，他把这次大会称之为“胜利的大会，团结的大会，前进的大会”。朱氏称：这次大会是全国工人阶级自一九二九年在上海秘密召集第五次全国劳动大会以来，十九年间日日夜夜盼望，时时刻刻争取的第一次全国性的大团结。同时这次大会的召开，又是在人民解放军向卖国的腐朽的国民党反动派所统治的地区胜利大进军的时候，正如中共中央祝词中所指出的：“表示在无产阶级领导下的我们人民解放战争已经走到最后胜利，表示全国性的新的大革命时期又已到来，表示国民党反动集团在全国工人中的分裂政策已经最后宣告破产，全国工人运动重新在革命的旗帜下统一起来。”\n    他指出这次大会的收获是无可限量的、宝贵的、伟大的。\n    首先，经过这次大会，使我们全国工人阶级在认识上和今后奋斗目标上有了一个更正确的和胜利的方向，这个方向就是：全国工人阶级首先应该团结自己、并联合农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、自由资产阶级与一切爱国分子，为彻底推翻美帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动集团在中国的统治，在工人阶级先锋队共产党与毛泽东同志胜利的旗帜下，建立新民主主义的人民民主共和国。\n    其次，大会恢复了中华全国总工会、并选出了正式和候补执行委员，组成了全中国工人阶级群众组织的统一的最高领导机关。它团结了国民党统治区各大城市和解放区的各种企业的二百八十三万工人，以统一步伐，向美帝国主义及其走狗国民党在中国反动统治作最后的胜利的斗争，这个组织——中华全国总工会，是世界工人阶级反帝、反侵略、反压迫及反分裂的民主阵线上一支有力量的队伍。它将在世界职工联合会的旗帜下，为世界职工运动的民主、和平、团结、统一的方向而奋斗，向以美帝国主义为首的反动阵营，尤其是以“马歇尔计划”为手段的分裂世界职工运动的阴谋作不调和的斗争。\n    再次，大会听取了各个地区的工运报告和工作报告，并仔细地研究了工时、工资和工人福利等问题，在目前任务决议案中都作了具体规定。这些是过去我们中国工人阶级在旧社会中奋斗了几十年还没有争取到的，而在这一次大会上胜利解决了。\n    同时，在听到了国民党统治区工人运动与工人生活的报告后，大会一致通过了“关于国民党统治区职工运动报告的决议”，并决定各解放区职工作义务工一天，支援他们的斗争。这一决议传出，东北各地职工立刻响应，已献款几千万元（东北币）。这说明了国民党统治区的职工同志们的斗争不是孤立的，他们有统一团结的中华全国总工会下二百八十三万会员作他们的后盾，他们的解放斗争一定会更快的得到胜利。\n    最后大会又一致拥护召开没有反动派参加的革命的新的政治协商会议，并且主张由中共来召集，从而建立革命的联合政府。\n    朱氏称：“现在时候到了：全世界民主力量日益高涨，中国人民的解放已接近最后胜利，谁要实行帝国主义侵略，谁要实行反动统治，谁就要在民主力量的打击之下遭受灭亡。中华全国总工会要领导和督促解放区工人阶级增加生产、支援前线，要领导和督促国民党统治区工人阶级继续英勇斗争，准备迎接解放军，解放全中国。中华全国总工会要根据历史上‘二七’、‘五卅’、‘省港罢工’、上海三次起义和第一次大革命时期工人阶级斗争的光荣传统和斗争中的英雄人物象林祥谦、施洋、刘华、汪寿华、苏兆征、邓中夏、罗登贤、邓发等同志的精神，完成伟大革命事业。代表们回到各人的岗位以后，必须用最大的决心，用灵活的方法来完成大会给我们的各项任务；当我们每一个人都尽到了我们应尽的力量的时候，我们的彻底解放就很快能达到目的了。”\n    最后他代表大会向中共中央、国内国外工人阶级和民主团体以及东北解放区党政军民各机关团体给予劳大的各种精神鼓励与物资慰劳，表示感谢。"

    "content": "Xinji Yuhua Public Store Has Planned Support for Production\n    [Report from this newspaper] Xinji Yuhua Public Store in Jizhong has clearly implemented the Party's guidelines and policies, and has gradually moved towards planned business operations. In the past six months, it has achieved significant results in stabilizing prices, supporting production, and assisting disaster areas. The store is located in the central part of the 11th District, with eight branches in the surrounding towns. Last year, the 11th District suffered a widespread drought, with the average yield in each county only reaching 50%. Zhao County's autumn grain harvest was only enough to supply the county's population for two months. Based on the above situation, the main store and branches have planned to organize long-distance transportation. By the end of July, a total of 14,999,900+ catties of wheat and 30,080,000+ catties of coarse grains were transported and sold from eastern Jizhong and the Bohai area of Shandong Province, with transportation costs reaching 900 million yuan. Among them, the Xinji market (main store) sold more than 16,000,000 catties of coarse grains; 80% were sold to Zhao, Luan, and other counties with the most severe disasters. The number of handcarts pushing grain in Zhao County increased to more than 700, with about 1,000 people involved. The Ningjin market (6th branch) regularly sold more than half of its grain to Zhao County; adding the 2,070,000+ catties sold by the 7th branch in Zhao County, the grain shortage problem was basically solved. In terms of support for the western mountainous areas, in addition to the main store's bulk transaction of more than 800,000 catties of coarse grains with Shijiazhuang, the Jiucheng market saw an average of 1,400 shi of grain brought in by the masses per market day, of which 50% to 70% were sold to Shijiazhuang and Huolu. The 3rd branch (Jiucheng) sold a total of 6,343,000 catties of miscellaneous grains, all of which were sold to the west. Due to the vigorous organization of transportation, the risk of selling livestock due to livelihood difficulties in disaster areas was resolved, the needs of the market were met, and the rise in prices was suppressed. Except for a brief fluctuation in mid-May, the prices were basically kept stable, allowing the masses in the disaster areas to eat relatively cheap grain. The masses in Zhao County generally reflected: \"If it weren't for the public store's grain transfer, the disaster would have been impossible to overcome!\" Some said: \"Having a cart is like having a guaranteed meal!\"\n    The store provided raw materials to the masses, solved the sales of finished products, and supported the sideline production of the masses. Taking textiles as an example, the main store and branches sold a total of 595,024 catties of ginned cotton and purchased 310,976 bolts of native cloth in the past six months. Among them, the disaster-stricken Zhao and Luan counties accounted for an estimated 177,706 bolts; calculating a gross profit of 20 catties of millet per bolt, the two counties could obtain 3,554,120 catties of millet. In May, due to the existence of a purely task-oriented view in management, the calculation of weaving profits was once insufficient, and the price increase could not keep up with the rise in grain prices, resulting in a slight decrease in the quality of native cloth. Later, it was stipulated that Grade A cloth should be calculated based on local grain prices and flower prices, and a gross profit standard of 20 to 23 catties of millet should be maintained, ensuring the quality of native cloth, which is improving day by day.\n    The store has also made considerable achievements in providing loans for shipbuilding and restoring river transportation. It has provided loans of 60 million yuan to organize 450 boatmen in 18 villages in Gao and Zheng (Ding) counties. Between March and April, 79 flat-bottomed boats were completed, and 31 privately funded shipbuilding projects were initiated. They were launched to load goods, and within half a month, 1,500,000 catties of coal were transported to eastern Jizhong through the Gaocheng 5th branch. The restoration of river transportation not only solved the difficulties of some land-scarce farmers along the river but also saved the public a lot of manpower and animal power. In terms of secondary businesses, a total of 1,490,000+ catties of salt were transported, 460,000+ catties of white oil were sold, and 3,954 catties of well-drilling equipment such as lead wire and palm bark, and 385 pieces of bamboo products were purchased and sold, directly supporting the development of agriculture and supplying the necessities of life for farmers.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Xing Jun, Mao Yucai)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 辛集裕华公营商店有计划的扶植生产\n行军　育才\n1948-09-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　辛集裕华公营商店有计划的扶植生产\n    【本报讯】冀中辛集裕华公营商店，明确贯彻党的方针政策，逐渐走向了有计划的经营业务。半年来，在稳定物价，扶植生产，支援灾区等方面，已获得重大成绩。该店位于十一分区中部，在周围城镇设有八个分店。去年十一分区普遍遭旱，各县平均只五成年景，赵县秋季收粮，仅供全县人口两月之用。根据以上情况，总、分店即有计划的组织远途调运，至七月底，从冀中东部与山东渤海区，共调运和出售小麦一千四百九十九万九千余斤，粗粮三千零八十余万斤，开支运费达九亿元之多。其中辛集市场（总店）即出售粗粮一千六百余万斤；百分之八十销到灾情最重的赵、栾等县，赵县推粮小车增至七百余辆，人数达一千左右；宁晋市场（六分店），经常有半数以上的粮食销往赵县；加上赵县七分店出售的二百零七万多斤，粮荒问题基本上得到解决。对西部山地的支持，除总店与石家庄大宗成交粗粮八十多万斤外，旧城市场每集群众上粮平均一千四百石，其中百分之五十至七十销到石家庄、获鹿一带；三分店（旧城）共出售杂粮六百三十四万三千斤，完全销往西部。由于大力组织了调运，解决了灾区因生活困难而卖牲口的危险，供给了市场的需要，平抑了物价的上涨。除五月中旬一度波动外，基本上保持了物价的稳定，使灾区群众吃到比较便宜的粮食。赵县群众普遍反映：“要不是公家商店的调粮，灾荒可没法过！”有的说：“有辆车，就保住了饭碗！”\n    该店供给群众原料，解决成品销路，扶植了群众副业生产。单就纺织说，半年来总分店共售出皮棉五十九万五千零二十四斤，收购土布三十一万零九百七十六匹。其中灾区赵、栾两县，估十七万七千七百零六匹；以每匹得毛利二十斤小米计算，两县即可得小米三百五十五万四千一百廿斤。五月份，由于经营上存在着单纯的任务观点，曾一度对织布利润计算不够，提价赶不上粮价的上升，土布质量有些降低。后来即规定甲等布根据当地粮价和穰花价计算，除去原料外，保持毛利润二十斤至二十三斤小米的标准，保证土布质量，日益提高。\n    在贷款造船，恢复河运方面，该店也作出相当成绩。曾贷款六千万元，在藁、正（定）两县的十八个村中，组织四百五十个船户，于三四月间，先后完成平船七十九只，并带起私资造船三十一支，下水装货，半月时间经藁城五分店运往冀中东部煤炭一百五十万斤。由于河运的恢复，不仅解决了沿河两岸一部缺地农民的困难，同时公家也节省不少人力畜力。在次要业务上，共运食盐一百四十九万余斤，出售白油四十六万余斤，购买与出售打井器材铅丝、棕皮三千九百五十四斤，缺竹货三百八十五件，直接扶植了农业的发展和供给了农民生活中的必需品。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（行军，毛育才）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: The fishing industry in the coastal areas of Shandong is gradually recovering and flourishing. When the enemy launched a \"major offensive\" against Shandong last year, some fishing areas suffered disasters due to enemy occupation and harassment. According to statistics from 21 fishing villages in the suburbs of Weihaiwei City alone, when the enemy fled Weihai, 1,600 out of a total of more than 2,000 fishermen were captured; nearly 300 out of a total of about 400 fishing boats were robbed or destroyed. In Longkou, Changshan Island, Penglai, and Fushan in the Jiaodong-affiliated Bohai coastal area, 858 fishermen were captured by the enemy, 167 were killed or injured, and 65 fishing boats were looted and destroyed. In Shijiusuo, Rizhao County, Binhai, 350 fishermen were extorted more than 21.5 million yuan in Beihai currency. The loss of other grains, clothing, and fishing gear is incalculable. The vitality of the fishing villages was almost completely damaged, and the fishermen's lives were plunged into misery. After liberation, the democratic government provided assistance to fishermen in various aspects. According to incomplete statistics, the Shidao Production Promotion Society in Jiaodong District, the Bohai coastal fishing areas affiliated to Jiaodong, Huanghua County (formerly Xinhua County, Hebei) in the Bohai District, Cangma County (newly established county, east of Nuocheng) in the Binbei Sub-district of Jiaodong District, and Shijiusuo in Rizhao County, Binhai District, have successively issued fishing loans of 171.69 million yuan in Beihai currency, 1.78 million catties of grain, and a large number of tung oil and hemp thread and other raw materials for repairing boats in the past six months. In addition, agricultural loans and salt amounting to 100.7 million yuan, and nearly 500,000 catties of relief grain were distributed. The fishermen's confidence in production has been greatly enhanced. They actively repaired their boats and nets to go fishing and have reaped great profits. The total value of fish production income in twelve seaports such as Liujiawan Village, Penglai, Jiaodong, this spring and summer was more than 923 million yuan. According to statistics from Fengjiabao Village in Huanghua alone, the income from fish in half a year was more than 1.069 billion yuan. The lives of the villagers have been greatly improved, and every family has two to three years of surplus grain. Although it is nearly mid-May, the fishery in Shidao Port is still very impressive, and 100,000 catties of horseshoe crab can be produced daily at the Lidao seaport. In the first half of the year, the Shidao fishing area produced a total of 11.3 million catties of fish. However, this is still a decrease of 15 million catties compared to last year. The main reason for the decrease in production is that enemy warships and planes constantly bombarded and strafed our ports, causing fishermen to dare not go far to fish. Enemy speedboats also rushed and dispersed schools of fish in the fishing area, and killed fishermen, causing losses of 120 million yuan to coastal fishermen and merchants. After the fishermen produce, the government also provides strong support for sales and exports. After the Shidao Sea Market ended, the 150,000 catties of shrimp caught by the fishermen were exchanged by the Promotion Society for fertilizer for the farmers at the cost of 50 catties of autumn grain per 100 catties, which satisfied both parties. In addition, the government has also helped develop sideline production related to the fishing industry, such as blacksmithing, spinning, and net-making. Preparatory committees for fishermen's associations have been established in some areas to lead fishermen's work and strengthen the struggle against the enemy at sea to protect fishermen's production. Autumn fishery production will be even more guaranteed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 重获解放后生产有保障　胶东渤海沿海各地渔民积极修船捕鱼\n\n1948-09-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　重获解放后生产有保障\n  　胶东渤海沿海各地渔民积极修船捕鱼\n    【新华社华东四日电】山东沿海各地渔业日趋恢复兴盛。去年敌人向山东进行“重点进攻”时，部分渔区，因遭敌侵陷及滋扰，渔民饱受灾难。仅威海卫市郊二十一个渔村统计，当敌人自威市逃窜时，全部二千余渔民即被抓走一千六百余人；全部约四百只渔船即被劫、毁近三百只。胶东所属渤海沿海龙口、长山岛、蓬莱、福山四地，被敌抓去渔民八百五十八人，打死打伤一百六十七名，劫去和破坏渔船六十五只；滨海日照县石臼所三百五十个渔民，被敌敲榨勒索北海币二千一百五十万余元；其他粮食、衣物、渔具的损失无法统计。渔村元气伤损殆尽，渔民生活陷入惨苦境地。解放后，民主政府从各方面给渔民以帮助，据不完全统计：胶东区石岛生产推进社、胶东所属渤海沿海渔区，渤海区黄骅县（原河北新海县）、胶东区滨北分区藏马县（新设县，诺城东）、滨海区日照县石臼所等渔区，半年来即先后发放渔贷北海币一亿七千一百六十九万元，粮食一百七十八万斤及大批桐油麻线等修补船只的原料，另发放农贷，盐达一亿零七百万元，救济粮食近五十万斤。渔民生产信心因之大为提高，积极修补船网下海扑鱼，获利甚丰。胶东蓬莱刘家旺村等十二个海口，今年春夏季鱼产收入总值九亿二千三百余万元；黄骅仅冯家保一村统计，半年得鱼折款十亿六千九百余万元，该村渔民生活大为改善，家家有两三年余粮。石岛海港，虽近五月中旬，渔业仍极可观，俚岛海口每日可产鳌鱼十万斤。上半年石岛渔区共产鱼一千一百三十万斤。但比去年还减产一千五百万斤。减产主要原因系由于敌军舰、飞机不断发炮轰击，扫射我各港口，致渔民不敢远出捕鱼；敌汽艇并在渔区横冲直撞驱散鱼群，捕杀渔民，使沿海渔商损失达一亿二千万元之巨。渔民生产后，政府又以大力帮助推销、出口。石岛海市结束后，渔民捕得之虾十五万斤，推进社帮助以每百斤秋后还粮五十斤的代价换给农民肥田，双方都很满意。此外政府并帮助发展渔业有关之打铁、纺线、结网等副业生产。个别地区已成立渔民会筹委会，领导渔民工作，加强海上对敌斗争，保卫渔民生产。秋季渔业生产当更有保障。"

    "date": "1948-09-10",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Fishermen of Haibao in Huanghua\n　　Huanghua County (i.e., Xin'hai County south of Tianjin, Hebei Province, originally under the Bohai District, assigned to the Jizhong District in August this year), the Haibao District, is a coastline over a hundred miles long. The entire district, except for one rural village, has twenty-three Haibao, with two thousand five hundred and ninety-eight fishing households. Before liberation, everything \"within sight\" and \"within reach\" belonged to the fort lords (similar to rural landlords). The fort lords traditionally held three major privileges: fort rights, sea rights, and land rights, turning fishermen into fishing serfs. Even if the fishermen built their own houses, the house ownership belonged to the fort lord, who could evict the fishermen from their houses at any time. The fort lords practiced cruel \"stripping,\" monopolized the sale of seafood, and engaged in usury and unpaid labor, among other feudal exploitations. \"Stripping\" meant that whenever fishermen returned from fishing at sea, they had to hand over 15% of their catch to the fort lord without compensation, and the fort lord could pick the best. If they did not catch good seafood, they had to buy good seafood from others to give to the fort lord. Furthermore, fishermen were not allowed to sell their seafood freely; they had to sell it to the fort lord at a low price and endure exploitation through rigged scales. Fishermen were not allowed to buy fishing gear from outside; they could only buy it from the fort lord at a high price. Under this cruel exploitation, fishermen's lives became difficult after the fishing season. The fort lord would seize the opportunity to offer high-interest loans, converted into low-priced seafood, to be repaid the following year. This type of debt was called \"shrimp debts.\" In addition, the fort lords forced fishermen to perform various types of unpaid labor and could arbitrarily rape fishermen's women. Women in the Fengjia Fort area dared not walk in front of the fort lord.\n　　The fort lords also organized armed forces to suppress the fishermen's resistance. Fishermen described the fort lords' establishment of public halls and armed suppression of fishermen as \"the golden palace of the Tongju family, the false court of Shimingxuan,\" and \"connected to officials above (colluding with the old government) and connected to bandits below (colluding with bandits).\"\n　　After liberation, through long and complex struggles, the fishermen finally gained liberation.\n　　The struggle was complex and tortuous. After the fishermen's struggle initially achieved victory, in 1946, the fort lords, led by Shi Mingxuan, organized armed special agents (Kuomintang returning legions, wearing tall hats) to carry out a restoration, reversing the achievements and shooting fishermen activists. Afterward, after a long struggle, the fishermen had their own armed forces—the Sea Defense Detachment, district teams, and village fishermen's joint defense teams—which crushed the reactionary fort lord forces and suppressed the fort lords who had committed heinous crimes. Last year, the struggle deepened further, but due to the implementation of policies without considering specific circumstances and mechanically applying the land reform model, \"dividing boats and nets\" was implemented, and class lines were drawn arbitrarily, failing to clearly distinguish the targets, which disrupted the class ranks. In the struggle, the interests of independent laborers and small property owners were attacked and damaged. Added to this were heavy fish taxes, some cadres issuing coercive orders, detaching themselves from the masses, and Kuomintang secret agents colluding with local feudal forces to spread rumors. Kuomintang armed forces constantly roamed the sea, robbing boats and kidnapping people. Therefore, the situation along this hundred-mile coastline was very chaotic, and many fishing boats fled elsewhere. Over a hundred fishing boats from Qikou Village alone fled to Donggu, affecting the fishermen's enthusiasm for production. After the Land Conference of the Bohai District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, it was decided that, in addition to eliminating the feudal occupation and exploitation of the fort lords, legitimate fishing at sea should be protected, and the policies of developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital were explained thoroughly and correctly. At the same time, it was decided to cancel the past practice of drawing class lines and determining class composition, and three of the four types of fish tax were abolished. Furthermore, county and district cadres humbly reviewed their past coercive orders and errors in policy implementation with the masses. These measures dispelled the fishermen's concerns about being struggled against if they became rich and the heavy burden of fish taxes. The two hundred and forty households and over a thousand people who had fled returned home to produce. Now, the three major privileges unique to the fort lords of past generations—sea rights, fort rights, and land rights—have been eliminated. The fishermen have their own houses, and there is no longer the threat of eviction. The sea belongs to the country, and fishermen can produce freely without any restrictions. Feudal exploitation such as \"stripping,\" monopolizing the sale of seafood, and usury has been abolished, and the fishermen are no longer subject to feudal exploitation.\n　　On the basis of the fishermen's emancipation, the democratic government has strengthened sea defense and provided loans of 52 million yuan in North Sea currency and 20,000 jin of grain to support the development of the fishing industry. Fishermen are competing to purchase means of production. Statistics show that the entire district has purchased more than 1,500 new fishing nets of various kinds and built and repaired 27 fishing boats. Villages have also restored and established organizations centered on production; some villages have already established village administrative committees. The cadres of the original fishermen's trade union have also participated in administrative leadership. New and old cadres and experienced producers in each village have organized production committees to lead various freely formed partnership groups in production. Fishermen's enthusiasm for production is high, and harvests are abundant, which has improved their lives. The entire village of Fengjia Fort has laid a total of 1,050 nets, and from the first month to the end of May of this year, the total value of seafood collected amounted to over 1 billion yuan. The entire village of Zhao Jia Fort laid 1,600 nets, had four salt marshes, and produced 400,000 jin of salt in addition to a large amount of seafood. The total profit for the entire village was 240 million yuan. The 158 households, 784 people, each earned an average of over 300,000 yuan. The fishermen in the entire district have produced enough food for at least one year this year, and for some, enough for three years. Fishermen are actively purchasing fishing gear, livestock carts, weaving machines, and organizing cooperatives and agency stores.\n　　In the past, maritime fishermen's lives had \"three surges\": winter was the \"stagnant surge\" (meaning they could not fish and had to sit at home and eat); spring was the \"wild surge\" (after eating up all the savings from fishing throughout the winter, they had to spend money to repair boats and nets); summer was the \"sunny surge\" (they caught fish, sold them for money, and had no worries about food, drink, clothing, and fuel). Now the fishermen say: \"This year's 'three surges' only have the 'sunny surge' left!\" Liu Chaofu of Yingtou, with his five brothers, caught more than 6,500 jin of fish and sold them for 7.86 million yuan, which can be exchanged for more than 39,000 jin of grain. The fishermen all say, \"We have never had such a good year.\" Zhao Li of Zhao Fort said, \"This year we have loans, more fish, and lower taxes, so it's all ours!\" Zhao Qingzhang had food to eat after receiving a production loan, he said: \"I will do whatever you ask me to do. I can't be separated from the Communist Party!\" After receiving loans for production, many fishermen also broke with their ideas of relying on the heavens and gods. Li Dianwu's mother from Tang Fort said: \"In the past, I believed in gods, burned incense and kowtowed, but for so many years, I didn't get anything! Now that the Communist Party has come, we have everything, this is the real god.\" After we abolished the feudal exploitation such as \"stripping\" by the fort lords at sea, the fishermen were freed from their chains and are living well. Ji Fengting of Langtuozi built three new rooms, and he said: \"This is what I saved by not having the fort lord 'strip' my catch.\" The fishermen of Mapengkouzi, who sold forty-seven wives and daughters in the famine years, are now rich and are busy looking for wives. The Haibao, which was formerly ruled by feudal forces, has now become the fishermen's own Haibao!\n　　Although the fishing industry here is doing very well this year, there is still a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Originally, one net boat was counted as ten and a half shares, the net owner counted as two and a half shares, the boat owner counted as two and a half shares; among the five people, the helmsman counted as one and a half shares, and the rest each counted as one share. The nets have to be repaired several times a year, which is borne by the net owner, and in reality, there is nothing left except for the repair money. The boat owners reflected: \"It's okay in such a good year, but if the year is slightly worse, we will lose money, so no fishermen are willing to add nets.\"\n　　Sea bandits are constantly harassing and sabotaging the fishermen's production. This year, Kuomintang bandits have harassed the area several times, shelling the fishermen in the area, robbing fishing boats, and constantly using planes to strafe the fishermen in the area. Our sea defense forces are actively operating on the coast and in the heart of the sea to protect fishermen's production, guarding against and attacking Kuomintang bandits, so that the fishermen dare to go to sea to fish. At present, the fishermen are asking to buy guns to defend themselves and protect their production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黄骅海堡的渔民\n\n1948-09-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黄骅海堡的渔民\n    黄骅县（即河北省天津以南的新海县，原属渤海区，今年八月划归冀中区）海堡区，是一条长百余里的海滨。全区除一个农村外，有二十三个海堡，二千五百九十八户渔民。解放前，“眼望无边”“手指所及”（即眼力所及、手指所向）都属于堡主（类似农村地主），堡主传统地操有堡权、海权、地权等三大特权，把渔民变为渔奴。渔民自己盖了房子，房权却属堡主，堡主随时可以拔锅揭席把渔民赶出自己的房子。堡主对渔民实行残酷的“扒货”、垄断海货出售和进行高利贷、无代价劳动等封建剥削。所谓扒货，即凡渔民从海中捕鱼回来，须按百分之十五毫无代价地纳给堡主，并且由堡主任意挑选。如未捕得好货时，还须买别人的好货送给堡主。此外，渔民所得海货一律不准自由出售，必须低价卖给堡主，并得忍受过秤时之大秤剥削。渔民不准向外购买渔具，只能以高价向堡主购买。在这种残酷剥削下，渔季过后，渔民生活即陷困境。堡主便乘机放高利贷，折成低价海货，待明年讨还。这种债务叫作“虾空子”。另外堡主还强制渔民无代价地给作各种劳动，堡主可以任意强奸渔民妇女。冯家堡一带渔民妇女不敢在堡主面前走。\n    堡主并组织有武装，镇压渔民的反抗。渔民拿“同聚家的金銮殿，时明轩的假朝廷”和“上通官（勾结旧官府），下通土（勾结土匪）”等话来描写当时堡主立公堂武装镇压渔民的残暴。\n    解放后，经过长期的复杂曲折的斗争，渔民终于获得了翻身解放。\n    斗争是复杂曲折的。当渔民斗争初步获得胜利后，一九四六年，堡主以时明轩为首组织了武装特务（还乡团、高帽队）实行复辟，倒回果实，枪杀渔民积极分子。之后，又经过长期斗争，渔民有了自己的武装——海防支队、区队以及各村渔民组织的联防队，摧垮了反动的堡主武装，镇压了罪大恶极的堡主。去年，斗争进一步深入，但又由于执行政策没有根据具体情况，机械搬运了土地改革的一套，实行“分船分网”，而且乱划阶级，没有很好分清对象，阶级阵营搞乱了；在斗争中打击与损害了独立劳动者和小资产者的利益，加上鱼税重和一些干部强迫命令，脱离群众，以及蒋匪特务结合当地封建势力乘机造谣；和蒋匪武装不断窜到海面上抢船捆人。因此在这一百多里的海岸线上，情况很是混乱，好多渔船都躲到外面去了。歧口一村即有百余只渔船逃亡东沽，影响了渔民的生产情绪。经过中共渤海区党委土地会议后，乃决定了除堡主的封建霸占剥削必须消灭外，海上正当渔业一律保护，并正确地深入地讲解了发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的政策。同时决定取消过去的划阶级定成份，四种鱼税取消了三种，另外县区干部虚心的向群众检讨了过去的强迫命令和执行政策的错误。经过这些工作打破了渔民怕过富了挨斗和鱼税太重的顾虑。躲出去的二百四十户、一千多人都回家生产来了。现在历代堡主所特有的海权、堡权、地权等三大特权铲除了，渔民有了自己的房子，再没有拔锅揭席的威胁。大海归国家所有，渔民可以自由生产，没一点限制。废除了“扒货”、垄断渔货出品、高利贷等封建剥削，渔民再不受封建剥削了。\n    在渔民的翻身基础上，民主政府又加强了海防，还贷款北海币五千二百万元，两万斤粮食，扶持渔业发展。渔民均争购生产工具。统计全区共增买各种渔网一千五百余条，新造及修理渔船二十七只。村里也恢复和建立了以生产为中心的组织；有的村已成立了村行政委员会。原来渔民工会的干部也参加了行政领导。各村新老干部和生产有经验的人组织了生产委员会。领导各种自由结合成的插伙小组进行生产。渔民生产情绪高涨，收获甚丰，生活即随之改善。冯家堡全村共下网一千零五十条，自今年旧历正月到五月底共征海货折款达十亿余元。赵家堡全村下网一千六百条，有盐滩四付，除获大批海货外，又出盐四十万斤，总计全村共获利两亿四千万元，全村一五八户，七八四人，每人平均得卅万余元。全区渔民今年生产所得，至少够一年食用，多者够三年食用。现渔民均积极添购渔具及牲口大车、织布机等，组织合作社、代理店。\n    过去海上渔民生活有“三涨”：冬季是“闷涨”（即是治不了鱼坐在家里干吃）。春季是“野涨”（一冬天把全年治鱼的积蓄吃光了，这功夫就得使钱收拾船、网）。夏季是“阳涨”（治了鱼卖下钱，吃、喝、穿、烧都不愁了）。如今渔民们说：“今年的‘三涨’，光剩下‘阳涨’了！”鹰头刘朝福，哥五个捕鱼六千五百多斤，卖了七百八十六万元，能换三万九千多斤粮食。渔民们都说：“没有过过这样的好年头。”赵堡赵立说：“今年贷粮贷款，鱼又多，税又轻，光剩咱的啦！”赵清章贷款后，生产有了饭吃，他说：“叫我干啥我干啥，我和共产党，算分不开啦！”经过贷款生产，好多渔民靠天赖神的思想也打破了。唐堡李殿武他娘说：“以先我顶信神，烧香磕头，这么些年，什么也没磕了来！如今共产党来了，什么也有了，这才是真神呢。”我们取消了海上堡主“扒货”等封建剥削后，渔民们解除了锁链，日子过的都很烘火。狼坨子姬风亭，新盖上三间房，他说：“这是没叫堡主‘扒货’省下来的。”马棚口子的渔民，闹荒年卖了四十七个老婆、闺女，今年过富了，都在张罗着讨老婆。从前为封建势力统治的海堡，现在已变成渔民自己的海堡了！\n    虽说今年这里的渔业生产很好，但目前还有个问题应当急待解决。原来这里一个网船算十个半股，网主算两个半，船主算两个半；五个人当中，掌船的算一个半，剩下的每人算一个。鱼网每年要收拾几回，都由网主负担，实际上除了收拾钱，没有什么剩余了。船主们反映说：“象这样的好年头还凑合，年头稍赖点就赔本，这样渔民们谁也就不愿添网了。”\n    海匪们是不断骚扰破坏渔民生产的。今年间蒋匪就骚扰该区数次，向该区渔民们打炮，抢渔船，并不时用飞机在该区扫射渔民。我海防部队为保护渔民生产，积极活跃于海岸和海心，警戒与打击蒋匪，使渔民们都大胆的下海治鱼了。目下渔民们都要求买枪自卫，保卫自个好好生产。"

    "content": "[Jizhong Electric] Huanghua County (newly established county, formerly belonging to the Bohai Liberated Area, assigned to Jizhong in early August) has 120 *li* of coastline and is a famous salt-producing area in North China. With the support of the democratic government, the county is expected to produce 150 million *jin* of salt this year, more than any previous year. The county produces four types of salt: the first is called \"Da Qing Salt,\" which is sun-dried from seawater, with over 270 salt fields and more than 3,100 salt workers. Small fields cover 50 or 60 *mu*, while large fields cover more than 300 *mu*. Each field employs 10 to 35 salt workers. The second type is called \"Well Field,\" also known as \"Er Salt,\" which is produced by drawing water from wells and sun-drying it. The third type is called \"Leaching Field,\" also known as \"Small Salt,\" which is produced by leaching salt-rich soil with well water and then sun-drying it; this type of work can be done even by semi-able-bodied people. The fourth type is \"Boiled Salt,\" which is the same as the boiling method used in Hejian and Renqiu in Jizhong. In Huanghua County, many women and children make a living from the salt industry. This year, the salt workers are doing better than in previous years, with some earning as much as 100 *shi* of grain, and others earning 20 or 30 *shi*. Before the \"July 7th Incident,\" during the Kuomintang rule, anyone who wanted to produce salt had to go through \"procedures,\" pay taxes, and be subject to \"exclusive purchase.\" The salt farmers worked extremely hard and lived a very difficult life. After the People's Liberation Army liberated the county in 1938, the democratic government vigorously supported the salt industry. At the Bohai Land Conference last winter, a policy was established to further develop the salt industry. The government provided 1.25 million *jin* of grain and 60 million yuan (North Sea currency, same below) in loans to 3,050 salt farming households. The Huanghua County Committee assigned 11 cadres to organize a salt farmers' union preparatory committee to lead the opening of salt fields and absorbed more than ten experienced and public-spirited veteran \"Niantou\" (old \"Niantou\" are skilled workers in the salt industry who can tell how much salt is in the water and direct the workers' work) to help with the leadership. Initially, the salt farmers had many ideological concerns, fearing that the government would buy the salt at a low price, that the loans would not be enough, that there would not be enough seawater, and that bandits would cause trouble, etc. After repeated mobilization and loan support, these concerns were gradually dispelled. On the eighth day of the first lunar month this year, the salt farmers' union mobilized everyone, saying: \"The army is going to fight to Nanjing and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. We must rush to the beach and turn the alkaline land into gold.\" When the salt farmers arrived at the beach, they were all worried when they saw the endless alkaline land and mud. Director Zhang of the county, and others, took the lead in assigning rivers and fields, influencing the salt farmers to go down to the fields together, and the work of assigning rivers and fields was completed in three days. On the sixteenth day of the first lunar month, 1,652 salt workers began to dig rivers, completing 21,715 cubic *fang* of earth in five days. By March 27th, 176 new salt fields had appeared. After the seawater came in with the tide, the newly dug rivers were filled with water, and both new and old fields produced salt at the same time.\n\nThe cadres of the salt farmers' union preparatory committee worked with the salt workers and conducted education in the fields during breaks. Because many new fields were opened, and there were few \"Niantou\", the cadres educated the \"Niantou\" to direct three to five fields each and paid attention to taking apprentices. This year, 300 new \"Niantou\" have been trained, solving the difficulty of a lack of technical personnel. Some salt workers still had the misconception of being \"struggled against\" for becoming rich. The union cadres explained to them our party's policy of developing production and becoming rich, proposing: \"More sweat, more rivers dug, more water coming in, more salt produced, more grain and money sold.\" These ideological concerns were gradually dispelled.\n\nThe lives of the salt workers have greatly improved. Old \"Niantou\" Zhao Kuiyu said: \"I have worked in 'Changlu Beach' for more than 40 years and have nothing left. Seeing the good times now, my heart is blooming.\" They all felt that they had truly turned over. Cao Guiquan, a Hui Muslim from Yang'erzhuang, earned six sacks of wheat, nine sacks of corn, and 100,000 yuan. He married a wife, bought a donkey, paid off his old debts, and still had enough grain to eat. Salt farmers added new furniture to their homes. In the past, they used dippers to draw water, but this year they added two waterwheels, 3,919 rocking waterwheels (water dragons), and lever water dippers. Since this spring, they have also added 700 mules.\n\nDuring the \"May Day\" Labor Day, the salt workers launched a \"model evaluation,\" \"model selection,\" and \"model award\" campaign, resulting in eight model fields and 148 model salt workers. From March to June, the salt workers averaged 20,000 *jin* of salt each. Large carts from six counties, including Dongguang and Huimin, went to transport salt, and the salt transportation industry developed along with the salt industry. Initially, smuggling was very serious, but after discussion among the members, it has been greatly reduced.\n\nCurrently, the salt farmers in the county have a high enthusiasm for production and are actively requesting to open new fields after the autumn harvest. Some are automatically assigning fields. They said: \"The old officials (referring to the Kuomintang authorities) have never done such a good thing!\" They asked to dig large rivers and deepen and widen the old rivers. The Huanghua County Committee is actively planning to develop sea salt, mobilizing salt workers from \"leaching fields\" and \"well fields\" to operate \"sea salt,\" and plans to formally establish the salt farmers' union to more effectively lead the salt farmers' work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黄骅盐业今年产量空前　产盐一万五千万斤\n\n1948-09-10\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黄骅盐业今年产量空前\n  　产盐一万五千万斤\n    【冀中电】黄骅县（新设县，原属渤海解放区，八月上旬划归冀中）沿海岸一百二十里，为华北著名产盐区。在民主政府扶植下，该县今年约产盐一万五千万斤，比过去那年都产的多。该县产盐分四种：一种叫“大青盐”，用海水晒成共有二百七十多付滩，三千一百多盐工。小滩占地五、六十亩，大滩占地三百多亩。一个滩有盐工十多人到卅五人。第二种叫“井滩”，又名“二盐”，是在地里掘井汲水晒成的。第三种叫“淋滩”，也叫“小盐”，以井水在盐土上淋过晒成，这种活半劳力也可以作。第四种是“熬盐”，和冀中河间、任邱等地的熬法一样。黄骅县妇女、儿童多以盐业为生，今年盐工的光景比那年都好，一个人最多的可赚一百石粮食，少的也赚二、三十石。在“七七事变”前国民党统治时期，谁要晒盐得办“手续”，纳捐税，还得“专买”。盐民劳动极重，生活很苦。一九三八年人民解放军解放该县后，民主政府即大力扶植盐业。去冬渤海土地会议上，确定了进一步发展盐业的方针。政府以一百二十五万斤粮食及六千万元（北海币，下同）贷给三千零五十户盐民。黄骅县委抽出十一个干部，组织盐民工会筹备会，领导开滩工作，并吸收十多个晒海盐有经验、热心公益的老“埝头”（老“埝头”是盐工里的技术工人，能看出水里有多少盐，指挥工人工作）帮助领导。最初盐民们还有许多思想顾虑，怕晒出盐来政府低价收买；怕贷的款不顶事；怕海水不够用；怕海匪扰乱等等。经过反复动员和贷款扶植，逐渐打破了这些顾虑。今年旧历正月初八，盐民工会动员大家说：“军队要打到南京去，活捉蒋介石。咱们要跑到海滩边，把海滩碱地变成金”。盐民们到了海边，对着一眼看不到边的碱地和稀泥，都发了愁。县里张科长等带头号河、号滩，影响盐民们一齐下了滩，三天就完成了号滩、号河工作。正月十六日，一千六百五十二个盐工开始挑河，五天完成二万一千七百十五方土。到三月二十七号，出现了一百七十六付新滩。海水上潮后，新挑的河里＠满了水，新滩和老滩同时出了盐。\n    盐民工会筹备会的干部，工作时和盐工一起工作，休息时到各滩进行教育。因为新滩开的很多，“埝头”又少，干部就教育“埝头”每人指挥三个到五个滩，并注意拉徒弟。今年已培养出新“埝头”三百名，解决了技术人材缺乏的困难。有的盐工还有怕过富了“挨斗”的错觉，工会干部即向他们讲解我党发展生产，发家致富的政策，提出：“出的汗多，挑的河多，来的水多，出的盐多，卖得粮食和票子多”。逐渐打破了这些思想顾虑。\n    盐工们的生活大大改善了。老“埝头”赵奎玉说：“我在‘长芦滩’干了四十多年，啥也没有剩下，看到眼下的好光景，心里开了花。”他们都觉着真正翻了身。羊二庄回民曹贵全挣了六口袋麦子，九口袋棒子和十万元。说了个媳妇，买了个驴，还完了陈帐，粮食还够吃。盐民们家家户户都添了新家具。过去都是用斗子提水，今年添了水车两辆，摇水车（水龙）三千九百十九辆，和杠水斗子等。今春以来还增加了骡子七百头。\n    过“五一”劳动节的时候，盐工们开展了“评模”“选模”“奖模”运动，出现了八个模范滩，一百四十八个模范盐工。三月到六月盐工们平均每人得到二万斤盐。东光、惠民等六个县的大车都去拉盐，运盐业随着盐业发展而发达了。最初走私很严重，通过会员讨论以后，已大大减少。\n    目前该县盐民生产情绪很高，积级要求秋后开新滩。有的自动去号滩。他们说：“老辈官家（指国民党当局）从来没办过这么好的事！”他们要求挑大河，把旧河加深、加宽。黄骅县委积极筹划发展海盐，动员“淋滩”“井滩”的盐工去经营“海盐”，并计划把盐民工会正式成立起来，更有力的领导盐民工作。"

TASS dispatch: Despite the organized campaign of terror and slander by reactionary forces, the American Progressive Party's election campaign is flourishing. Regardless of the repeated disruptions by fascist thugs, Wallace continues his tour of the Southern states. Even many of his hostile critics have said that Wallace's courage in the face of terror will win him huge support, especially among Black people. At the same time, the Progressive Party's vice-presidential candidate, Taylor, is also making an election tour of the Western states, regardless of the reactionary forces' violence. In several states, reactionaries are attempting to deprive the Progressive Party of the right to participate in the election through all sorts of legal tricks. Following Missouri, the Illinois electoral board, composed of both Democratic and Republican parties, decided on August 31st not to allow the Progressive Party to run in the state. Nevertheless, the Progressive Party will undoubtedly remain an important force in the election. Recent opinion polls show that the Progressive Party will win around one million votes in New York State and retain a significant influence in major states such as Illinois and California. Within labor organizations, although the CIO Executive Board passed a resolution on August 31st, after intense debate, by a vote of thirty-five to twelve to support Truman's election, the twelve major unions within the CIO that originally supported the third party, such as the Transport Workers Union and the Electrical Workers Union, still adhere to their position of supporting the Progressive Party.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 不顾反动派的恐怖诽谤攻势　美进步党竞选运动排除困难蓬勃开展\n\n1948-09-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　不顾反动派的恐怖诽谤攻势\n  　美进步党竞选运动排除困难蓬勃开展\n    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社讯：美国进步党的竞选运动虽在反动派有组织的恐怖与诽谤攻势下，仍在蓬勃地展开。不顾法西斯暴徒的一再捣乱，华莱士仍继续其在南方各州的旅行。即使许多敌视他的评论家也说了，华氏在恐怖行为面前所表示的勇气，将使他能赢得巨大的支持，尤其在黑人之中。同时，进步党的副总统候选人泰勒，也同样不顾反动派的暴行，正在西部各州作竞选旅行。在若干州内，反动分子企图以各式各样的法律诡计来剥夺进步党参加选举的权利。继密苏里州之后，伊利诺斯州由民主与共和两党组成的选举委员会，又于八月卅一日决定不让进步党在该州竞选。尽管如此，进步党无疑仍将为选举中的一支重要力量。最近的民意测验表明：进步党将在纽约州获得百万张左右的选票，并在伊利诺斯、加利福尼亚等大州保有重大的影响。在劳工组织中，虽然产联执行局于八月三十一日在激烈辩论后以三十五票对十二票通过支持杜鲁门竞选的决议，但产联中原来支持第三党的各大工会如交通工会、电气工会等十二个工会，仍坚持其拥护进步党的立场。"

To strengthen his increasingly unstable dictatorial rule and to enhance his control over state institutions and the people, the Tito clique substantially reorganized the Yugoslav cabinet on August 31. According to Agence France-Presse, the number of Deputy Prime Ministers has been increased from two to three after the reorganization. Police chief Rankovic has been promoted to Second Deputy Prime Minister, while remaining Minister of the Interior. Former First Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj remains in office and replaces Simic as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Four members of Tito's personal clique have joined the cabinet, one of whom is former Serbian Prime Minister Nicickovic, who has been appointed Third Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Federal Control Commission. According to a report by the Telegraph Agency, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's *Truth Daily*, in commenting on the latest reorganization of the Yugoslav cabinet, pointed out that the Tito clique has degenerated into a group of murderers. The \"reorganization\" clearly demonstrates the panic and instability felt within the Tito camp.

    "content": "Jizhong Electric News: The Jizhong Women's Federation issued instructions calling on women in various regions to actively participate in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. It pointed out that the central task of women's work in September and October is the autumn harvest and wheat planting. All regions must recognize that organizing the vast number of women for production has special significance in the context of a shortage of male labor. Therefore, all regions must universally call upon and effectively organize the vast number of women to participate in production, making them one of the main forces on the production front. All non-disaster areas and lightly affected areas should organize women for the autumn harvest and wheat planting, participating in harvesting, seed selection, threshing, manure accumulation, manure delivery, plowing, and wheat planting, according to their labor conditions. They should also organize female labor to replace male labor and female labor to replace animal power (other regions with conditions for labor exchange should do the same). At the same time, domestic affairs should be appropriately organized (such as childcare, cooking, needlework, etc.) to free up time for field labor. In disaster areas, in addition to planting wheat in areas where it is possible, the main task is to organize women's sideline production. Women's federations in various regions should, according to local conditions and sideline production habits, deeply organize women to carry out various sideline productions, and cooperate with relevant departments at any time to solve their production difficulties (such as capital, sales, etc.). They should also call on women and children to dig wild vegetables, collect leaves, and practice frugality to prepare for famine. In border areas, women's work is mainly to combine production with the struggle against the enemy, carrying out anti-plunder, anti-arrest, and anti-rape campaigns, providing support to the front lines, and sheltering working personnel. During the autumn harvest and wheat planting period, the main task is to organize the masses to protect the autumn harvest, organize women to participate in the autumn harvest protection struggle, and combine with the armed forces to participate in quick harvesting, quick planting, quick gathering, quick threshing, and quick hiding. Through this year's autumn harvest and wheat planting work, unite the vast number of middle and poor peasant women and all women who oppose enemy and puppet looting and rape, and establish women's organizations according to the situation. Regardless of disaster areas, non-disaster areas, or border areas, attention should be paid to organizing the production of military dependents. Not only should mutual aid in cultivation be organized for military dependents who truly lack labor, but more importantly, military dependents should be organized and educated to engage in production themselves. In the future, in the development of production, these women should be educated to recognize that it is glorious for their children or husbands to go to the front line to kill the enemy, and it is also glorious to work hard in production in the rear. Only through production can they have a good life. In addition, education should be carried out among representatives and male peasants to change their views of disliking trouble and not valuing women's production (especially field production).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中妇联号召妇女积极参加秋收种麦\n\n1948-09-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中妇联号召妇女积极参加秋收种麦\n    【冀中电】冀中妇联会发出指示，号召各地妇女积极参加收秋种麦。指出：九、十两月的妇女工作，以秋收种麦工作为中心。各地必须认识，在男劳动力缺乏情况下，组织广大妇女生产更有其特殊意义。因此，各地必须普遍号召与切实组织广大妇女参加生产，使之成为生产战线上的主力之一。凡非灾区和轻灾区，都要组织妇女秋收种麦，根据劳动条件参加收割、选种、打场、积肥、送粪、耕地、种麦等工作，并组织女工换男工和女工换畜力（其他地区有条件换工者同此）。同时将家务应适当组织好（如看孩子、做饭、针线活等），挤出时间到田间劳动。在灾区：除能种麦地区进行种麦外，主要是组织妇女副业生产。各地妇会应根据地区情况及副业生产习惯，深入组织妇女开展各种副业生产，随时配合有关部门解决她们生产上的困难（如资本、销路等）。并号召妇女，儿童挖野菜、采树叶、节衣缩食，以备渡荒。在边缘区：妇女工作主要是结合生产进行对敌斗争，开展反掠夺、反抓捕、反奸淫，进行支前，掩护工作人员等。在秋收种麦期间，主要是组织群众护秋，组织妇女参加护秋斗争，和武装结合，参加抢收、抢种、快收、快打、快藏。通过今年秋收种麦工作，团结广大中贫农妇女及一切反敌伪抢掠奸淫的妇女群众，并根据情况建立妇女组织。无论灾区、非灾区、边缘区，都要注意组织军属生产，不仅对确无劳力的军属组织代耕互助，更重要的是组织教育军属自己动手生产。今后在发展生产中要教育这些妇女，认识自己的子弟或丈夫上前线杀敌是光荣的，自己在后方努力生产也是光荣的，只有生产才能过好光景。此外还要向代表会和男农民进行教育，转变他们某些嫌麻烦不重视妇女生产的观点（尤其是田间生产）。"

    "date": "1948-09-11",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "(Taiyue Telegram) The Yangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on organizing and mobilizing women to participate in production. It first commended the exemplary deeds of women in production during the great participation in the war last year, such as the 65 women in Zujiahe harvesting over 600 mu of crops and planting over 70 mu of wheat, achieving early planting and early harvesting despite the excessive lack of male labor. Another example was the 106 women in Jiangli Village learning to plow and plowing 600 mu of land last autumn. The instructions then pointed out that the erroneous view of underestimating women still widely exists. For example, leadership only organizes women in emergencies during crash campaigns, lacking regular organizational work. Some mothers-in-law and men still oppose women going to the fields. Some women who return from working in the fields also have to cook and endure family grievances, and some can't even afford a hair clip after working for a year, so their enthusiasm is not high. Secondly, in organizing women's production, the phenomenon of coercion and unequal value is common. Some mutual aid teams' accounts have not been settled to this day, causing some groups to disband, and some exist only in name. In addition, the leadership's bad work style of only focusing on form and not content has led to serious spontaneous flow. Therefore, the following guidelines for organizing women's production are determined: (1) Resolutely implement the principle of voluntary and equal value, change the style of coercion, restore and rectify women's mutual aid organizations, clear old wages, implement work points based on labor, work hours based on people, and settle accounts in a timely manner. Pay attention to cultivating leading backbones to gradually form a mutual aid core. (2) Implement a 20/80 profit-sharing system (women get 20% of their labor income, and the family gets 80%). On the one hand, educate women that they eat and dress at home and should not have excessive demands. On the other hand, persuade families that women's participation in labor increases family wealth, and giving them some share can encourage them to be more active in production. (3) In terms of organizational forms, be flexible according to customs and seasons, and do not be confined to one form. It should be convenient for women to participate in production. (4) Don't neglect sideline production because of organizing women to participate in agricultural production. In sideline production, leadership should be strengthened to organize labor exchange. For example, in spinning, weaving, and raising silkworms, efforts should be made to ensure everyone does their best, learns from each other's strengths, and compensates for weaknesses, with equal exchange and no one suffering losses. Do not force weak and small-footed women to work in the fields, so as not to harm women's health. At the same time, pay attention to combining education to meet women's literacy needs. According to the principle of \"learn what you do,\" use \"little teachers\" to teach women to read, read newspapers, and improve women's political awareness and culture.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 动员妇女参加生产　阳城县委发出指示\n\n1948-09-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　动员妇女参加生产\n  　阳城县委发出指示\n    【太岳电】中共阳城县委最近发出关于组织动员妇女参加生产的指示。首先表扬了去年大参战时菹家河六十五个妇女收割六百多亩庄稼，种了七十多亩麦子，在男劳力过分缺乏的情况下，做到了早种早收；匠礼村一百零六个妇女学会犁地，去秋犁地六百亩等妇女生产模范事迹。继即指出：轻视妇女的错误观点仍普遍存在，如领导上只是在紧急时，突击组织一下，缺乏经常的组织工作。有些翁婆与男人还反对妇女下地，有些妇女上地劳动回来，又做饭、又受家庭的气，还有的劳动一年连一个头发卡子也买不上，因此情绪不高。其次在组织妇女生产时，强迫命令，不自愿，不等价的现象是普遍的，有些互助组的帐至今还没算清，闹的有些组散伙了，有些是有名无实。再加领导上只讲形式，不看内容的坏作风，形成了严重的自流。因此确定今后组织妇女生产的方针：（一）坚决贯彻自愿等价原则，改变强迫命令的作风，恢复整顿妇女互助组织，清理旧工资，实行按活记分，按人记工，及时结帐。注意培养领导骨干，使逐渐形成互助核心。（二）实行二八分红制（妇女劳动所得工资，自己得二成，家庭得八成），一方面教育妇女：吃在家，穿在家，要求不能过高。一方面说服家庭：妇女参加劳动是增加家庭财富，分给一些，能鼓励她们更积极生产。（三）在组织形式上，要根据习惯和季节，灵活组织，不应拘于一种形式。要便于妇女参加生产。（四）不能因组织妇女参加农业生产，就忽视了副业生产。在副业上、应加强领导，组织变工。如纺织，养蚕，要做到各尽所能，取长补短，等价交换，互不吃亏。不能勉强体弱脚小的妇女下地劳动，以免损害妇女健康。同时注意结合教育，满足妇女识字要求。根据“做啥学啥”的原则，利用“小先生”教妇女识字，读报，提高妇女政治和文化。"

General Nie pointed out: The North China Liberated Area was created under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through the long-term bloody struggle of the broad masses of people and the People's Liberation Army in North China. Besides the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, this is the oldest liberated area in the country, with a long-standing foundation of work by our Party, the workers' movement since the \"February 7th\" strike, the peasants' struggle since the First Great Revolution, and the glorious revolutionary traditions of the May Fourth and December 9th student movements. Here, we stood together with the broad masses of people and persisted in the eight-year arduous War of Resistance Against Japan, smashing countless frenzied mopping-up operations by the enemy. If we forget this history, we cannot imagine what the North China Liberated Area is today. General Nie recounted the course of the war and the victories achieved on the North China battlefield from the beginning of the Liberation War in July 1946 to the present, stating: In the first year of the war, the Kuomintang reactionaries concentrated seventy-three brigades and launched offensives against our Chahar, southern Shanxi, northern Henan, western Shandong, and southern Hebei simultaneously with superior forces. At that time, under the wise strategic guidance of Chairman Mao, in order to concentrate our forces to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, and without being concerned about the gains and losses of one city or one place, we voluntarily withdrew from sixty-five cities. This forced the enemy to disperse their forces to guard points and lines, creating favorable conditions for our army to annihilate the enemy. Therefore, by January 1947, the strategic offensive of the Kuomintang bandit army on the North China battlefield had been thwarted. From February to April, our army had completely grasped the initiative. From April to June, our army carried out continuous offensive operations on all fronts in North China, annihilating a large number of enemies and recovering and liberating dozens of county towns. As a result of the first year of combat, a total of 430,000 enemies were annihilated, breaking the enemy's division of the central Hebei area from the northern Yue area, and the northern Yue area from the Taihang area; causing the enemy to fall into a passive position with insufficient forces, while our initiative was increasingly strengthened. In the second year of the war, the Shandong and Northwest battlefields inflicted continuous and serious blows on the enemy, and the three major armies of Liu Deng, Chen Xie, and Chen Su successively marched south, turning to strategic offensives, gloriously realizing Chairman Mao's strategic policy of pushing the war into the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This enabled the North China Liberated Area to smoothly carry out the task of clearing the enemy in its hinterland. From the second half of last year to the first half of this year, we successively liberated important strategic strongholds such as Shijiazhuang, Yuncheng, and Linfen, and recovered southern Chahar and northern Yanbei. Recently, the Jinzhong campaign, directly commanded by Comrades Xu Xiangqian and Zhou Shidi, recovered all areas outside Taiyuan and fourteen county towns. At present, except for the isolated city of Taiyuan, which is besieged by our forces, all the strongholds left by the enemy in the center of the North China Liberated Area have been cleared, and the North China Liberated Area has been completely connected with the Shandong and Jin Sui Liberated Areas. Now, our army on the northern front has cut off the Pingbao Line, isolating Baoding; another unit of our army has entered eastern Hebei to fight, and the victory of the third year of the war is foreseeable. In total, over the past two years, the enemy has been eliminated, reaching 713,800 people, including 451,000 captured, 253,000 killed or wounded, and over 9,000 who revolted and returned to our side. A total of over 260,000 rifles and short guns, over 20,000 light and heavy machine guns, over 4,000 artillery pieces, and other large quantities of military fire weapons and equipment were seized. The number of liberated cities increased by forty-three after offsetting gains and losses.\n\n　　General Nie Rongzhen pointed out: Our victories were by no means accidental. Because the justice of our war represents the interests of the broad masses of the people, the people consciously and willingly participate in, support, and support this new democratic revolutionary war against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In particular, because the basic areas of the North China Liberated Area implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, reasonable burdens, and democratic politics during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and universally promoted land reform after the surrender of Japanese bandits, realizing \"land to the tiller,\" the people's political awareness and organizational strength reached a considerable level. This enabled them to have an unwavering determination to thoroughly eliminate imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang reactionary group. The people in areas such as Ji-Lu-Yu, northern Henan, and the Pingjinbao triangle area are now not only directly fighting heroically against the Kuomintang army and the disasters and Yellow River floods they created, which are even more serious than during the Japanese occupation, but also undertaking and completing arduous war service under the conditions of a seesaw battle between the enemy and us. The people of North China sent a large number of outstanding sons and daughters into the People's Liberation Army, forming today's powerful North China Field Army and local army, and also forming the ever-victorious Liu Deng Army, which, under the wise command of Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, crossed the perilous Yellow River, liberated the 40 million people of the Central Plains, and restored and opened up the Central Plains Liberated Area; at the same time, the people of North China continue to support the war in the Central Plains with all possible manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Therefore, our victory should first of all be attributed to the people, and victory is also the people's own.\n\n　　General Nie then pointed out: The experience of the past twenty years and more has proved that without the great strategic policy of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we cannot carry out a victorious revolution and a victorious revolutionary war. The Liberation War of the past two years has also proved the complete correctness of Chairman Mao's strategic policy and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's command. Precisely because we have the correct strategic policy, and at the same time we rely on the meticulous planning, courageous fighting, and hard work of all the commanders and fighters and logistics personnel, carried out a new type of military consolidation within the army, implemented the three major democracies of military, political, and economic affairs, strengthened daily political work and policy discipline education, and improved relations between the army and the people, the political awareness and combat effectiveness of the troops, especially their ability to attack strongholds, have been greatly improved. Therefore, it has been possible to forcibly occupy strongly fortified cities such as Shijiazhuang, Yuncheng, and Linfen. This has greatly improved the military, political, and economic status of the North China Liberated Area, enabling us to further strengthen support for the war and continuously achieve victory in the war.\n\n　　General Nie also pointed out: Our war is a comprehensive war led by the proletariat and closely combining the military, political, economic, and cultural aspects of the masses of the people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, in the future, under the conditions of thoroughly eliminating the feudal system, liberating productive forces, and relatively stable environment, the central task of the North China Liberated Area is to do everything possible to restore and develop production, strive to build, and more powerfully support the front line of the Liberation War. Only when all the forces in the rear are fully mobilized and organized, developing production, and supporting the front line, can we achieve a more decisive and complete victory in the Liberation War; and only the victory of the war can consolidate and develop our production and political, economic, cultural, and other construction undertakings, that is, consolidate and develop the achievements of the people's war victory.\n\n　　Finally, General Nie Rongzhen called on the military and civilians of the entire region to prepare for the possibility of encountering many difficulties and twists and turns on the road to final victory, and to continue to wage arduous struggles. At present, in addition to continuing to fight in the northern section of Pinghan and eastern Hebei, our North China Field Army is thoroughly eliminating the enemy in Shanxi. Only the two isolated cities of Taiyuan and Datong remain in the entire territory of Shanxi. Its complete liberation and the complete annihilation of the Yan Xishan bandit army are not far off. At the same time, we must continue to thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi bandit armies entrenched on the northern front, and fight valiantly for the liberation of the entire North China, in order to cooperate with and accelerate the final victory of the National Liberation War.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北临时人代大会上　聂荣臻将军报告军事\n\n1948-09-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华北临时人代大会上\n  　聂荣臻将军报告军事\n    【新华社华北八日电】华北军区司令员聂荣臻将军八月十日代表华北军区，向华北临时人民代表大会报告两年来华化人民解放战争的伟大胜利。聂将军指出：华北解放区是在中国共产党领导下，由华北广大人民和人民解放军长期流血斗争所创造的。在全国范围内除了陕甘宁边区以外这里是最老的解放区，这里曾有我党长期工作的基础，“二七”以来的工人运动，第一次大革命以来的农民斗争和五四及一二九以来的学生运动等光荣的革命传统。在这里，我们曾经和广大人民在一起，坚持了八年最艰苦的抗日战争，粉碎了敌寇无数次疯狂的扫荡。如果忘记了这些历史，就不能想象会有今天这样的一个华北解放区。聂将军叙述自一九四六年七月解放战争开始迄今两年来在华北战场上的战争经过与胜利战绩称：战争的第一年，国民党反动派集中了七十三个旅，以优势兵力向我察哈尔、晋南、豫北、鲁西、冀南同时举行进攻。当时我们在毛主席英明的战略方针指导下，为集中兵力歼敌有生力量，不计较一城一地得失，曾主动撤离了六十五座城市。迫敌分兵把守点线，造成了我军歼敌的有利条件。因此，到一九四七年一月国民党匪军在华北战场上的战略进攻就已遭顿挫。二月至四月我军已完全掌握了主动权。四月至六月我军在华北各战线进行了连续的攻势作战，歼灭了大量的敌人，收复和解放了几十座县城。第一年作战的结果，共歼敌四十三万人。打破了敌人对冀中与北岳、北岳与太行的分割；使敌人陷于被动和兵力不足，我主动地位则日益增强。战争的第二年，山东和西北两大战场给予敌人连续的严重打击，刘邓、陈谢、陈粟三支大军先后南征，转入战略进攻，光荣地实现了毛主席的把战争推向国民党统治区的战略方针，这就使华北解放区得以顺利进行肃清腹地敌人的任务。从去年下半年到今年上半年，我们即先后解放了石家庄、运城、临汾等重要战略据点，收复了察南、雁北。最近由徐向前、周士第两同志直接指挥的晋中作战，又收复了太原外围全部地区及十四座县城。目前除被我围困的太原孤城外，敌人留在华北解放区中心的据点已全部肃清，并使华北解放区与山东与晋绥两解放区完全衔接起来。现在北线我军又打断了平保线，孤立了保定；我另部并已进入冀东作战，战争第三年的胜利是可预期的。总计两年来消灭敌人共达七十一万三千八百余人。其中俘四十五万一千人，毙伤廿五万三千余人，起义来归的九千余人。共缴获长短枪二十六万余支，轻重机枪两万余挺，炮四千余门及其他大量军火武器和装备。解放城市得失相抵增加四十三座。\n    聂荣臻将军指出：我们获得这些胜利决不是偶然的。因为我们战争的正义性，代表广大人民的利益，因此人民自觉自愿地参加、拥护和支持这一反对帝国主义反封建主义反官僚资本主义的新民主主义的革命战争。特别是由于华北解放区的基本地区，在抗日时期曾实行减租减息，合理负担，和民主政治，在日寇投降后又普遍地推行土地改革，实现了耕者有其田，人民政治觉悟和组织力量达到相当的高度，这就使他们对反帝反封建反官僚资本主义，彻底消灭国民党反动集团具有坚定不移的决心。冀鲁豫，豫北，与平津保三角地区等地的人民，现在不但直接与国民党军及其所制造的比日寇时期更为惨重的灾难和黄灾作英勇搏斗，并在敌我拉锯作战的情况下，担负和完成了繁重的战争勤务。华北人民把大批优秀子弟送入解放军，组成了今天这样强大的华北野战军与地方军，而且组成了常胜的刘邓大军，在刘伯承、邓小平两将军英明指挥下横渡黄河天险，解放中原四千万人民，恢复和开辟了中原解放区；同时华北人民并继续以一切可能的人力、物力、财力支援中原的战争。因此我们的胜利，首先应归功于人民，胜利也就是人民自己的。\n    聂将军继指出：近二十余年来经验证明，离开了中共中央毛主席的伟大的战略方针，我们就不能进行胜利的革命和胜利的革命战争。两年来的解放战争同样证明了毛主席战略方针和朱总司令指挥的完全正确。正因为我们有正确的战略方针，同时我们又依靠了全体部队指战员与后勤人员的精心计划，奋勇作战与努力工作，在军队内部进行了新式整军，实行了军事、政治、经济三大民主，加强了日常政治工作与政策纪律教育，改善军内军外关系，使部队政治觉悟、战斗力特别是攻坚能力大大提高，因此能够强攻占领象石家庄、运城、临汾等坚固设防的城市。这就大大改善了华北解放区的军事、政治、经济的地位，使我们能够进一步加强支援战争，不断的取得战争的胜利。\n    聂将军又指出：我们的战争是无产阶级领导的人民大众的反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的军事、政治、经济、文化等密切结合的全面战争。因此，今后华北解放区，在彻底消灭封建制度，生产力获得解放，及环境相对的安定的条件下，中心任务是全力恢复与发展生产，努力建设，更有力地支援解放战争的前线。只有一切后方的力量充分动员与组织起来，发展生产，支援前线，才能够取得解放战争更有决定意义的和彻底的胜利；也只有战争的胜利才能够巩固与发展我们的生产和政治、经济、文化等各项建设事业，亦即巩固与发展人民战争胜利的成果。\n    最后，聂荣臻将军号召全区军民，在走向最后胜利的道路上，还要准备可能遇到许多困难和曲折，还须继续作艰苦的斗争。我华北野战军目前除在平汉北段和冀东继续作战外，正在彻底消灭着山西的敌人，山西全境只剩下太原与大同两座孤城，它的全部解放和阎锡山匪军的全部消灭，已为期不远了，同时，我们还要继续去彻底消灭盘踞北线的蒋傅匪军，为解放全华北而奋勇作战，以配合与加速全国解放战争最后胜利的到来。"

Since the fall of the Marie cabinet, the notorious Ramadier and Schuman have successively made failed attempts to form a cabinet. When Schuman accepted the task of forming a cabinet on August 31, he announced a so-called Schuman economic plan, which was no different from the Renault plan, regarding the most important issue that the new government must solve—the economic problem. This plan immediately met with a strong counterattack from the French working class. The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) issued a public statement on the 2nd, calling on workers to oppose the plan. The statement first stated that wages must be increased. The statement said: From August 1st to September 1st, the minimum cost of living in France has risen from 12,900 francs to 13,500 francs. In order to restore the ratio between wages and prices on December 1, 1947, wages must be adjusted according to the cost of living equal to 13,500 francs. The statement emphasized that if Schuman's policy is implemented, the result will inevitably be a continued and substantial rise in prices, resulting in serious consequences. Finally, the statement expressed satisfaction with the rapid unity of the working class, and pointed out that it was precisely this rapidly growing unity that thwarted the plans of the former government and forced it to resign. Under this new call of the General Confederation of Labor, hundreds of factories across France immediately went on strike to support the demands of the General Confederation of Labor. A large number of members of the Christian and \"Workers' Force\" unions also united around the General Confederation of Labor, regardless of the opposition of their leadership organizations, and finally forced \"trade unions of various tendencies, including Christian trade unions and 'Workers' Force', to put forward more forceful wage increase demands\" (Agence France-Presse).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 响应总工会号召反对舒曼经济计划　法数百座工厂罢工\n\n1948-09-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　响应总工会号召反对舒曼经济计划\n  　法数百座工厂罢工\n    【新华社陕北八日电】各方报导：法国工人运动再度高涨。自马利内阁倒台以来，臭名远扬的拉马第与舒曼，又曾相继作了失败的组阁试验。当舒曼于八月三十一日接受组阁任务时，对于新政府必须解决的最重要问题——经济问题，宣布了一套与雷诺计划没有丝毫区别的所谓舒曼经济计划。这一计划立即受到法国工人阶级强有力的反击。法国总工会于二日发表公报，号召工人反对该项计划。公报首先说明工资必须增加，公报称：自八月一日至九月一日，法国最低生活费用，已自一万二千九百法郎上涨至一万三千五百法郎。为恢复一九四七年十二月一日工资与物价间的比例，工资必须按照等于一万三千五百法郎的生活费用予以修正。公报强调指出：如果实行舒曼的政策，其结果将是不可避免地使物价继续大大上涨，从而造成严重的后果。最后，公报对工人阶级的迅速团结表示满意，并指出：正是由于这种迅速增长的团结，从而挫败了前政府的计划并迫使其辞职。在总工会这一新的号召之下，全法数百座工厂立即举行罢工，支持总工会要求，大批基督教和“工人力量”工会的会员亦不顾其领导机关之反对，团结在总工会的周围，最后迫使包括基督教工会和“工人力量”在内的“各种倾向的工会都提出了更加强有力的增资要求”（法新社）。"

Three hundred and sixty representatives from South Korea and two hundred and twelve representatives from North Korea attended. The meeting was opened by Tan Younian (transliteration), an 82-year-old non-partisan farmer from South Korea and veteran of the liberation movement. After pointing out the historical significance of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly, Tan stated: The so-called \"National Assembly\" and \"government\" of South Korea have been established in violation of the will of the Korean people, composed of reactionary and anti-people elements, and are pursuing the goal of permanently dividing the country and transforming South Korea into a colony of the United States. The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly, on the other hand, is elected by the vast majority of the people of North and South Korea and composed of representatives of all classes of people, and therefore it is the true representative body of the will of the entire Korean people. The task of this assembly is to approve the Korean constitution, establish a national democratic government, and guarantee the unity and independence of Korea. In conclusion, Tan expressed gratitude to the Soviet people, the Soviet army, and the people's leader, Marshal Stalin, for liberating the Korean people and assisting them in their struggle for freedom and independence. After electing the Chairman and two Vice-Chairmen of the Supreme People's Assembly, the congress adopted the agenda of the congress, which included approving the Korean constitution, electing the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, forming the Korean government, and electing the Supreme Court. On the afternoon of the same day, the congress elected a constitutional committee composed of forty-nine people and elected Kim Ko-bong, Chairman of the Presidium of the North Korean People's Assembly, as the chairman of the committee.

    "author": "Hao Jimin, Zhang Haoran",
    "date": "1948-09-11",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "To the Editor:\n\nRecently, it has been discovered that many local and warehouse leaders are not taking care of grain, and are not responsible for its storage, causing the grain to rot. Some are even embezzling and stealing. This selfish behavior, which disregards the people's hard work and harms the interests of the revolution, should be given high attention by leading organs at all levels. Here are some opinions based on materials reported by the Fourth Special Prefecture of the North Yue District: The grain sub-depot in Nan Jicheng, Fifth District of Lingshou County, has incomplete accounts that cannot be reconciled. A false seal is pasted on the door of the grain depot, and it is used more than a dozen times. Village cadres privately open the seal at any time to \"borrow grain.\" According to the existing figures, the hall has borrowed more than 14,000 catties of grain (including 25 times by 13 cadres, and also borrowed by people with so-called good relations with cadres). In the village of Bei Jicheng in the same district, the main responsible cadres used the price difference between the public grain discount and the market price to sell public grain in large quantities, profiting more than 12 million yuan. With such income, they wasted it greatly, spending more than 310,000 yuan on travel expenses alone, and the village chief privately borrowed 61,000 yuan. Mengjiatuo cadres privately sold about 6,000 catties of public grain. In Zhongqingjing Village, nine cadres including Han Niannian privately divided 2,413 catties of public grain into their own pockets, benefiting themselves at the expense of the public. Cadres in Nantixia Village stole 750 catties of public grain and 82 catties of cotton. Li Qiusheng, an old grain official, reported 120 catties more per scale when sending wheat to the warehouse, and the cadres divided the spoils. Wang Jiansheng and others in Xicheng Nanwang could not find the whereabouts of 700 catties of rice supplied to the military. After the Gangbei Poor People's Group pretended to help newly liberated farmers, they privately used 2,000 catties of grain. This spring, the Third Grain Depot milled more than 700,000 catties of rice, but more than 120,000 catties have not been recovered. Sun Shuande in Xiguan Village mixed more than 30 catties of sand into each bag of rice he delivered. The Wujiazhuang rice milling team bought 32 dou of sprouted grain and privately used it to offset public grain rice. Among the eight rice milling households in Beihu, seven ate and sold grain privately. Meng Tuo's Meng Shubao privately sold 400 catties of milled rice to use as his own rickshaw capital.\n\nThe above-mentioned serious phenomena of anarchy and lack of discipline probably exist not only in Lingshou. This should arouse widespread inspection in various places. This is certainly due to the selfishness and irresponsibility of the cadres of various grain depots, but it is actually caused by the bureaucratic style of the leading organs, the lack of inspection, and the failure to educate the cadres. It is suggested that leaders in various places should combine \"Lenin on How Soviet Officials Should Work\" to examine their own work, strictly implement the grain depot system, clarify responsibilities, and give appropriate punishment to those who make serious mistakes or persist in their errors. Those who are corrupt should be ordered to return the money, and those who manage grain well should also be commended. Thoroughly rectifying grain depots should be the urgent task of leading organs at all levels.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: San Francisco News: The strike of dockworkers and seamen on the US Pacific Coast broke out on September 2nd. By the 3rd, three of the five dock and seamen unions on the Pacific coast, namely the International Longshore and Warehouse Union affiliated with the CIO, the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union affiliated with the CIO, and the independent Marine Firemen, Oilers, Watertenders and Wipers Association, with a total of 30,000 workers, had joined the strike. The other two unions are also holding meetings to discuss participating in the strike. Their slogan is \"One for all, all for one.\" This strike, which insists on a 15-cent hourly wage increase, was originally scheduled for June 15th, but was postponed to today due to Truman's order to freeze wages for 80 days. The strike has paralyzed shipping in all ports along the US Pacific coast from Mexico to Canada, halting about 160 freighters. Dockworkers union leader Bridges, speaking to cheering union members on the 3rd, declared that this strike is a struggle for survival. He said: \"We have bowed our heads and begged, and all we have received is cold contempt. Now, we must prepare for a four- to six-month strike. Unless it is on our terms, we will no longer negotiate with the capitalists.\"\n\nAnother report: Approximately 10,000 truck driver workers in New York City also went on strike on September 1st, insisting on wage increase demands. As of the 3rd, the strike was continuing and expanding. This strike is threatening the economic life of New York City, the economic center of the United States: bridges and thoroughfares are blocked, goods are piling up at railways and docks, and the supply of goods to stores is partially interrupted. The New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry has requested Truman to issue an order to prohibit the strike for 80 days under the Taft-Hartley Act, because they fear that this strike will seriously affect the implementation of the \"Marshall Plan\" and American foreign trade.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美太平洋海岸码头海员工人　三万人罢工争生存  纽约卡车司机万人亦罢工\n\n1948-09-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美太平洋海岸码头海员工人\n  　三万人罢工争生存\n    纽约卡车司机万人亦罢工\n    【新华社陕北七日电】旧金山消息：美国太平洋海岸码头工人与海员工人的罢工，已于九月二日爆发。至三日止，太平洋岸五个码头与海员工会中已有三个工会，即产联所属的国际码头与仓库工人工会、产联海员厨师与侍者工人工会及独立的生火工人工会三万人参加罢工。其他两工会亦在召开会议，讨论参加罢工事宜。他们的口号是“一人为大家，大家为一人”。这坚持每小时增资一角五分而举行的罢工，原订于六月十五日举行，但以杜鲁门下令冻结八十日而延至今日。罢工已使美国太平洋岸从墨西哥至加拿大的沿海各港口之航运陷于瘫痪，一百六十艘左右的货轮因之停顿。码头工会领袖布利治三日对向其欢呼的工会会员演说时声称：这次罢工是生存的斗争。他说：“我们曾经低头恳求，而我们得到的只是冷眼的轻蔑。现在，我们必须作四个月至六个月的罢工准备。除非依照我们的条件，我们将不再与资方谈判。”\n    又讯：纽约市卡车司机工人约一万人，亦因坚持增资要求而于九月一日罢工。罢工迄三日止，仍在继续与扩大中。这一罢工正威胁着美国经济中枢——纽约市的经济生活：桥梁与通路阻滞、铁路与码头上货物山集、商店的货源部分中断。纽约市工商协会已要求杜鲁门根据塔夫脱——哈特莱法下令禁止罢工八十天，因为他们害怕这一罢工将严重影响“马歇尔计划”及美国对外贸易的实现。"

This kind of frantic robbery by the Kuomintang reactionaries has severely impacted not only the general working people and small and medium-sized merchants, but also managers of large stores and companies that are unrelated or have little relation to the four major families, who have become targets of their extortion and robbery. In the past half-month, the Kuomintang government, under the pretext of violating price control \"laws,\" has arrested large numbers of merchants and vendors from various industries, including finance, jewelers, grain, department stores, food and beverage, stationery, pharmacies, shoes and hats, hotels, barbershops, and bathhouses, in cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Guiyang, Changsha, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Xuzhou, and Kaifeng.

In Qingdao alone, more than two hundred people have been arrested; while in Shanghai, \"police stations are filled with various victims of the government's economic cleansing.

The majority of these arrested merchants and vendors have been subjected to the Kuomintang gang's cruel extortion, and some have even been sent to \"special criminal courts\" for trial. Hungry wolves also pounced on former sworn brothers of their rogue president Chiang Kai-shek.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 8th: After the \"Four Evaluations\" (evaluating fighting spirit, evaluating wisdom, evaluating command, and evaluating policies) rectification and the summer military training, a certain brigade of the Northwest People's Liberation Army displayed an astonishingly high fighting spirit and excellent combat actions in this battle to fiercely annihilate the 36th Division of the Kuomintang army on the southern Huanglong front. Du Pengcheng, a reporter from the Northwest Frontline, reported his observations from participating in this battle to Deputy Commander Peng and Gan Siqi, Director of the Political Department of the Northwest Field Army. Deputy Commander Peng believes that this in-depth combat style of party news reporters and their responsible method of reporting the situation to leading bodies are worthy of promotion. He specifically sent a letter to the Northwest General Branch to publish the letter. The original text of Du's report to Deputy Commander Peng and Director Gan is as follows:\n\n    The last time our reporters gathered at the frontline branch, you instructed us to frequently reflect the true situation of regiments, battalions, and companies. Therefore, I will briefly describe what I saw during the annihilation of the 36th Division for your leadership's reference.\n\n    On the 8th, when attacking Huti Mountain, the column called for planting the great banner of the People's Liberation Army on Huti Mountain. Therefore, it only took two hours to capture it in one fell swoop during the offensive. In a certain brigade that first climbed the mountain, I saw the following characteristics:\n\n    First, the troops have made amazing progress after the summer's \"Four Evaluations\" and large-scale military training. This is reflected in their heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, refusing to leave the front line when wounded, and persevering in combat to the end. Almost all cadres exclaimed, \"Evaluating fighting spirit has changed the troops.\" When the battle began, squads and groups bravely and suddenly climbed up the enemy's front lines everywhere. The enemy could not cope, so the fortifications were quickly broken through layer by layer. Zhang Darong, a soldier from a certain regiment, was wounded twice but refused to leave the front line. Blood covered his body, but he firmly denied that he was wounded. Xue Jinzhong, a soldier from a certain regiment, applied to join the Party before the battle. During the assault, he ran ahead of the entire class, drilled through a hole pierced by a shell, and threw five grenades, wiping out an enemy squad. He was wounded three times, and although the wounds were serious, he did not leave the front line. He said, \"I won't go down. As long as I don't sacrifice, I will strive to join the Party!\" When he rushed up, he was stunned by a shell. When he regained consciousness, he climbed up again to charge. Many soldiers suddenly pounced on the enemy's gun emplacements, stuffing explosive packs and grenades into the \"turtle nests\" (underground bunkers). Qiao Bosheng, the squad leader of the eighth squad of a certain regiment, and a soldier pounced into the enemy crowd. The follow-up troops lost contact with them. The enemy threw grenades at them. He quickly picked up four or five and returned them to the enemy. Then he pounced on the enemy's heavy machine gun, killing the enemy gunner, and immediately turned the enemy's gun to fire on the enemy. They generally not only sustained three or four wounds without leaving the front line, but also refused to be carried away when wounded, saying, \"Don't worry about me, just attack!\" They crawled down themselves, struggling to return. The fourth company of a certain regiment suddenly inserted itself into the enemy's heart—the Huti Mountain temple peak. There were twenty-two wounded in the entire company, some with three or four wounds, some with broken legs, and some with broken arms. The entire eleventh regiment had more than sixty seriously wounded, but no one went down. They said, \"Even if we die, we want to join the Party.\" When they and the ninth company rushed to the final group of fortifications on the top of the mountain, they started throwing grenades at each other. Smoke obscured the sky, and the mountains shook. Many companies rushed up, but could not gain a foothold. They lay on the ground and rolled out a little, turned over and pounced again. This was repeated three or four times, or even seven or eight times. In short, they were determined not to retreat a step, \"Wherever we advance, we will hold that position.\" A squad in the second company of a certain regiment was bleeding from all seven orifices due to a shell explosion. Everyone said they had been killed, but they crawled out of the smoke and charged forward again. The fourth company of a certain regiment climbed up again and again, once, twice, three times, four times, to plant the victory red flag on the top of the mountain. When the ladders were broken and people were wounded, they built them again and climbed again. From this side, that side, all directions, regardless of any danger, the red flag finally fluttered on the top of Huti Mountain. This heroism is truly admirable!\n\n    Second, the battle fully demonstrated conscious and automatic combat morale. Lower-level cadres and soldiers used their brains; there were many examples of combat being automatically continued by acting leaders after squad leaders and platoon leaders were wounded or killed. There were many vivid examples of resourcefulness, taking the initiative to find the enemy's weaknesses and subdue them. Peng Qingyun, Zhang Youde, and other six young soldiers from the second company of a certain regiment were praised as \"Little Tigers.\" They repeatedly engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, shouting, charging, and killing, penetrating directly into the enemy's midst. When they lost contact with their own company, they asked the third company to command them. Wang Chenghai, a soldier from the fourth company, after everyone in his squad was defeated, ran to the second platoon and said, \"I am under your command!\" and continued fighting. In this way, no matter who a soldier lost contact with, as long as you were one of our own, he would join in and fight together. This spontaneity made the enemy helpless. Because once they attacked, every squad, every group, and every individual climbed up from all directions. No matter how capable the enemy was, they could not cope. As long as one person went up, if the enemy could not kill him, he would charge and kill from left and right, making it impossible for the enemy to respond.\n\n    Third, they feared no difficulties or sacrifices to support neighboring fraternal units. The fifth company of a certain regiment automatically inserted itself to help a neighboring unit repel an enemy counterattack and recapture the lost position of the neighboring unit. When a neighboring unit on the right of a certain regiment was threatened by the enemy, the eighth company of that unit automatically repelled three enemy counterattacks, repelling several enemy counterattacks in a very difficult and almost impossible-to-stand situation. When the third company of that unit was blocked in its attack, the second company automatically supported it from the other end. The enemy was threatened from both front and rear, and was thus wiped out in one fell swoop.\n\n    Fourth, our infantry-artillery coordination was the most outstanding in this battle (but there were also shortcomings). As soon as our infantry charged, artillery fire was always ahead of the infantry, destroying enemy firepower points and blasting the enemy with their men and weapons to the side. As our infantry advanced, the artillery fire immediately shifted to the front of the infantry, encouraging the commanders and fighters to constantly shout, \"Good shot!\" It was very common for rifle grenades to be fired into enemy gun emplacements. The soldiers in these companies were also very surprised. They said, \"Practicing tactics has really taught us skills.\"\n\n    Fifth, the heroic examples on the battlefield and the mutual encouragement of political mobilization work had a great effect. For example, the political instructor of the first battalion of a certain regiment stood still even when seriously wounded, inspiring the soldiers. Some shouted slogans: \"Comrades, fight resolutely!\" \"Comrades, be calm!\" \"Communists must be heroic, and not leave the front line when wounded!\" \"Long live combat heroes!\" These slogans resounded throughout the battlefield. This time, a certain brigade put forward slogans such as \"Everyone mobilizes, join the Party on the front line\" and \"Make contributions to the people's cause,\" which played a great role. In terms of disintegrating the enemy, they shouted, \"Who are you fighting for?\" \"Your parents are starving, who are you fighting for?\" \"If you die, Chiang Kai-shek won't be sad, but your parents will be sad!\" Finally, the enemy on the top of the mountain surrendered under our fierce attack and the coordination of our shouting.\n\n    Sixth, this war was truly a mobilization of everyone. For example, the grooms and cooks of a certain regiment automatically organized ten stretchers. The captain of the medical team, doctors, and others of a certain regiment sustained serious injuries. They bandaged themselves and then bandaged the wounded, persevering until the end of the battle.\n\n    The reason why the above facts are valuable is that they are very common actions, not individual examples. After the battle, a certain brigade suffered 370 casualties, but the enthusiasm for joining the Party was even greater, and the morale was even higher. Many soldiers sharpened their fists and rubbed their palms, saying, \"It's not fun enough, we want to fight more!\" All this shows the new face after the Four Evaluations movement and the summer military training.

Everyone unanimously agreed that a committee for inspecting substitute farming should be formed jointly by cadres and the masses, and they began to conduct door-to-door inspections the next day. There were a total of 23 military dependents' households in the village, with 143 households of the masses responsible for cultivating 88 mu of irrigated land and 32 mu of dry land. This year, 2.5 mu of irrigated land and 1.9 mu of dry land were left uncultivated. Chen Yanqing was cultivating a piece of dry land five li away for Zhang Naiyuan. In the past, the crops on this piece of land never grew well, but this year they are growing very well. Whatever work he does, he always does it for the military dependents first. The land he cultivates has already been weeded twice, and he plans to weed it a third time. The land that Li Zhengfang cultivated for Tian Qiyuan has already been weeded three times. Chen Yanqing, Li Zhengfang, and thirteen others were selected as models of substitute farming in this inspection, and they were commended at mass meetings, on the public blackboard, and on the radio station. Bad practices are to be criticized and educated. Yang Xiangyuan was cultivating 3.8 mu of irrigated land for Li Ting, but he had only weeded it once, the weeds were not killed, and no fertilizer had been applied. He received severe criticism. After the inspection, three conditions for substitute farming for military dependents were stipulated: 1. If cultivation is neglected or delayed, resulting in a failure to plant, compensation will be paid appropriately based on the average yield. 2. If weeding is neglected, and military dependents are forced to hire others to do the weeding, the substitute farmer should be criticized and compensate for wage losses. 3. For those who generally do less or cultivate poorly, public criticism and education will be conducted at mass meetings. Then, a forum for military dependents was held to ask them what difficulties they had. Everyone unanimously said: \"It won't be bad to have such frequent inspections! If you do this, it doesn't matter if there are any difficulties later.\" The military dependents were very satisfied.

    "content": "[North Yue News] In Jia Village, Meng County, the labor substitute farming work has been rectified through democratic discussions among the masses. The village has a total of 301 households, with military, worker, and martyr dependents accounting for 56 households. Military, worker, and martyr dependents cultivated 555 mu of land themselves, while the remaining 234 mu were farmed by the masses as substitutes. Among them, 8 households relied entirely on substitute farming due to a lack of labor, 31 households relied on substitute farming for a portion of their land, and a portion was not farmed as a substitute.\n\nIn the past, the substitute farming work in the village was not done well. Both the masses and the military, worker, and martyr dependents had many opinions about the substitute farming work. For example, everyone was dissatisfied when only new military dependents received substitute farming, while old military dependents did not.\n\nIn early April, the work team held separate discussion meetings with the masses in the village to mobilize them to discuss the substitute farming work. At that time, there were two different opinions. Most people said: \"The children of military dependents go to the front line to protect the masses. Without them, the masses in the rear would not be able to live peacefully, so we must do a good job in substitute farming.\" A few people said: \"Young and middle-aged people joining the army is their duty. Preferential treatment is acceptable, but when working, they (military dependents) must take care of the food and drink for the people and livestock.\" The work team enlightened everyone to continue studying which principle was correct. After another argument, the former opinion gained the sympathy of the masses. Many people believed: \"We cannot let the land of military dependents be wasted. People are shedding blood desperately on the front line, and it is the responsibility of the masses to farm their land as substitutes in the rear.\" After such discussions, the masses voluntarily signed up to participate in substitute farming and found their own targets, then determined the acreage or labor for substitute farming. Because the substitute farmers were all looking for military dependents they got along with, the relationship was relatively close, and there were fewer disputes. Jiang Sishang contracted to farm Sun Zhong's three mu of land, which was much better than when others farmed it as substitutes. The two sides seemed very harmonious; Jiang Sisheng and ten others contracted to farm Jiang Shoudu's fourteen mu of land, and when sowing, they first consulted with Shoudu's family about what crops to plant, and the work they did made Shoudu's family very satisfied.\n\nIn order to solve the difficulties of military dependents in a timely manner, four military dependents groups were formed, and the village elected a military dependents representative to regularly reflect the opinions of military dependents and check the substitute farming situation according to the season. Village cadres such as Jiang Sixiao, the village party branch secretary, and Liu Siyou, the farmers' association chairman, personally supervised and inspected the substitute farming work. They regarded the substitute farming work as very important and studied the substitute farming issue at every meeting.\n\nAfter this rectification, the military dependents felt very satisfied. They reflected: \"This year's planting was early and the weeding was good, which is much better than before.\"\n\n(Jia Village's method of solving the substitute farming problem through democratic discussion and clarifying the masses' thinking is good. However, the point of \"voluntarily signing up to participate in substitute farming\" may have loopholes, because substitute farming is the duty of every citizen. While it is acceptable to find one's own target on this basis, one cannot abandon one's duty under the pretext of volunteering. --Editor)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 贾村注意照顾军属　民主整顿代耕\n\n1948-09-11\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　贾村注意照顾军属\n  　民主整顿代耕\n    【北岳讯】孟县贾村劳力代耕工作，经群众民主讨论进行整理。该村共有三百零一户，军、工、烈属占五十六户。军、工、烈属自己养种着五百五十五亩地，其余二百三十四亩由群众代耕。其中没有劳动力全部依靠代耕者有八户，代耕一部分的有三十一户，另有一部未代耕。\n    过去该村代耕工作做的不好，不论群众或军、工、烈属，对代耕工作均有不少意见，例如光给新军属代耕，不给老军属代耕，大家就不满意。\n    四月初，工作组在该村分头召开群众座谈会，发动群众讨论代耕工作。当时有两种不同的意见，大部分人说：“军属子弟到前线去，是为了保护群众，没有他们，群众在后方就不能过平安日子，所以一定要做好代耕工作。”少数人说：青壮年当兵是他应尽的责任，优待可以，但做活时他们（军属）要管人和牲口的吃喝”。工作组启发大家，继续研究到底哪个道理对。经过再次的咯吵，前面的意见获得群众的同情，好多人认为：“可不能荒了军属的土地，人家前线拼命流血，在后方给他代耕是群众的责任。”经过这样讨论后，群众都自动报名参加代耕，并自找对象，再确定代耕地亩或代耕的劳力。因为代耕者都是找和自己对劲的军属，关系比较密切，纠纷也就少了。姜思尚包种了孙忠的三亩地，比别人代耕时种的强多了。双方显得很和谐；姜思圣十个人包种着姜守渡十四亩地，在播种时先找守渡家商量种什么庄稼，做的活使守渡家非常满意。\n    为了及时的解决军属的困难，又组成了四个军属小组，全村又推出一个军属代表，经常反映军属意见，按季节检查代耕情形。该村支部书记姜思孝、农会主席刘四犹等村干部都亲自督促检查代耕工作，他们把代耕工作看的非常重要，每次接头会议上，都研究代耕问题。\n    经过这次整顿后，军属都感到很满意，他们反映：“今年种的早锄的好，比先前强多了。”\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　\n    （贾村经过民主讨论，打通群众思想，解决代耕问题，这个办法是好的。但“自动报名参加代耕”一点则可能发生漏洞。因为代耕是每个公民应有的义务，可在这个基础上自找对象，却不能借口自动而放弃义务。——编者）"

Morale in the Kuomintang military in Northeast, North, and East China is disintegrating, and the number of deserters fleeing to the Liberated Areas is increasing daily, especially among the enemies besieged in Changchun, Shenyang, Xinmin, and Jin County. According to statistics, one enemy officer and soldier reception center established by the People's Liberation Army on the Northeast front alone received 1,738 officers and soldiers from various units of the enemy's New First Army, New Third Army, New Sixth Army, etc., who had deserted and fled to the Liberated Areas from June 18 to the end of July, including 822 non-commissioned officers. A large number of soldiers from the 87th and 88th Divisions entrenched in northern Shaanxi deserted, leaving only forty or fifty men in each regiment. Partial statistics from Wanping and Liangxiang in the West District of East China, Rongcheng, Dingxing, and Jin County in Central Hebei, and Yutai, Shanxian, and Feicheng in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area from January to June show that more than 12,000 enemy soldiers were received after surrendering. Among the 1,118 enemy officers and soldiers received in the West Hebei District from January to June, many were from the enemy's 16th Army, 92nd Army, etc., who voluntarily surrendered with their weapons. In the Jiaodong District of the East China Liberated Area, in July alone, 479 enemy personnel were received after surrendering, more than in any month in the first half of the year, and most of them had fled from the enemy's main force units, with the 54th Division accounting for 286 alone. After the Kaifeng and Eastern Henan campaigns, the 5th Army, one of the enemy's five main forces, has recently experienced platoon-level desertions. To prevent soldiers from deserting, the enemy in various places has employed various methods of special agent surveillance and brutal suppression, but they have been unable to stop it. For example, the remaining enemy troops in Jiaodong stipulate that soldiers and platoon leaders cannot go out without a company commander's note; a three-person guarantee system is implemented in the company; new recruits are not issued guns normally, only when they are drilling. However, one company of the New Third Brigade originally had ninety-seven men, but within a month, only twenty-eight remained. When the soldiers of that company ran away, three squad leaders took their guns to catch them, but they also took the opportunity to escape. Then the platoon leader took his gun to catch the squad leaders, but he also disappeared. The company commander and special agent chief saw that things were going badly and were afraid of being punished, so they finally defected to the Liberated Area.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 跑！跑！跑！　东北华东敌军官兵纷纷跑到解放区来\n\n1948-09-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　跑！跑！跑！\n  　东北华东敌军官兵纷纷跑到解放区来\n    【新华社陕北五日电】东北、华北、华东各地国民党军事军心涣散，士气日趋低落，逃亡投奔解放区者日益增多，尤以困踞长春、沈阳、新民、锦县之敌为最甚。据统计，仅东北前线解放军某地所设立之敌军官兵收容所一处，从六月十八日起至七月底止，收容逃亡投奔解放区之敌新一军、新三军、新六军等各部官兵达一千七百卅八名，内尉部兵八百二十二名。困驻于陕北八十七师、八十八师士兵大批逃亡，每团仅剩四五十人。华东西区之宛平、良乡，冀中之容城、定兴、锦县，冀鲁豫之鱼台、单县、肥城等地自一月至六月的部分统计：共收容投诚敌军一万二千余名。其中平西区一月至六月收容之敌军官兵一千一百一十八名中，不少系从敌十六军、九十二军等部自动携械投诚者。华东解放区之胶东区，仅七月份一个月，收容投诚之敌军人员四百七十九名，较之上半年任何一个月为多，其中且绝大部分是从敌主力部队逃来的，仅整五十四师即占二百八十六名。开封、豫东战役后，号称敌五大主力之一的整五军，最近亦已发生整排逃亡现象。各地敌为防止士兵逃亡，施用了种种特务监视与残酷镇压办法，但亦无法制止。如残留胶东敌军规定，士兵和排长无连长条子不能外出；在连里实行三人联保；新兵平时不发枪，只在出操时才发枪。但新三旅的一个连原来有九十七人，一月内就跑剩了二十八人。该连士兵跑了，三个班长带枪去捉，结果也趁机逃跑了。于是排长又带枪去捉班长，但也一去不返。连长、特务长见事已糟，怕被惩办，最后就都投奔到了解放区来。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Short Commentary\n\n　　\"Gold Yuan\" Fails\n    Since the Kuomintang reactionaries announced the \"currency system reform,\" they have told a lot of myths about the omnipotence of the \"Gold Yuan,\" such as \"full reserves,\" \"containing 0.22217 centimeters of pure gold,\" and \"firmly believing that the price level will gradually return to pre-war levels,\" and so on. But despite all the hype, prices have generally risen. From the issuance of the fake Gold Yuan to the present, the most urgent \"emergency economic measures\" of the Kuomintang reactionaries have been to use economic police and secret agents to indiscriminately arrest merchants and vendors who \"do not comply with price limits\" and send them to special criminal courts. They call this method \"gagging.\" They dig a dike themselves, but fire at the raging flood, saying, \"Don't flow!\" The people are suffering, but the water still has to flow. This kind of pretending to be foolish madness is not the first time for the Kuomintang reactionaries. As early as January 15, 1943, they had already implemented a set of forced price limits, announcing that \"those who violate the price limit policy, both buyers and sellers, will be punished according to military law,\" and after the orders and talks, they arrested people everywhere. But what was the result? Price limits were transformed into negotiated prices, then into self-negotiated prices for various industries, \"evaluating and raising, evaluating and raising,\" the more limited, the more fierce the rise. Before long, the so-called price limits disappeared and completely went bankrupt, and prices continued to rise. Five and a half years later, the Kuomintang reactionaries' plunder of the people and destruction of production have become even more ferocious, and the amount of their income falling short of expenditure, that is, relying on inflation, has become even greater. The \"Gold Yuan\" and \"emergency economic measures\" began to go bankrupt as soon as they appeared.

They held symposiums with the families of those in the puppet regime, explained the Party's lenient policy, and mobilized fathers to call their sons and wives to call their husbands. Two reception stations for surrendered puppet and diehard personnel were set up in Liujiazhuang Shanmencheng. They were granted freedom after registration. Those who surrendered with weapons were given bonuses. When the news reached the remnant troops of the puppet Zhang Zhen, stationed in Datong, soldiers came back in groups of three or five at first, and then in entire squads and platoons. Although the enemy in Datong repeatedly spread rumors to deceive the soldiers, saying: \"Shi Fushen (a platoon leader of Zhang's bandit troops) led a platoon of brothers to surrender to the Eighth Route Army. But after handing over their guns, they were all killed. If you run back, none of you will survive.\" In order to expose Zhang's lies, Shi Fushen personally wrote letters to his comrades, causing even more desertions. In June and July alone, more than 1,200 people were received, bringing 77 rifles, 3 light machine guns, 5 pistols, and 3 small cannons, as well as a lot of bullets and hand grenades. More than 2,500 fugitive households were persuaded to return to their hometowns, and the government allocated land to them and arranged for them to engage in production.\n　　[North Yue Telegram] Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's troops in Chanan and Western Hebei are constantly defecting and revolting to our side.

Among the 126 received in July, 65 were from the Provisional 4th Army, 20 from the Provisional 3rd Army, 35 from the 35th Army, 1 from the 32nd Army, 2 from the Provisional 10th Division, 1 from the 54th Army, and 2 from Fu Zuoyi's trusted Guard Regiment. Most of the surrendered soldiers were conscripted, and most of them were honest farmers, including 104 farmers, 13 small merchants, 5 cattle and sheep herders, 2 businessmen, 1 weaver, and 1 antique dealer. The reception station for escaped soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi's troops in Zhuolu County received 217 people from January to the end of July, bringing 6 rifles and 1 broken gun.

In the 8th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the × Regiment of the Provisional 4th Army, Li Zengchuan and four others deserted from the 1st Platoon in two days. The 8th Squad of the 3rd Platoon was on guard in the southwest corner of Xuanhua City, and the squad leader led the entire squad to desert.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, August 8th: When the People's Liberation Army was operating on the Xu-Ji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Front, the transfer station under the Lu Zhong Support-the-Front Headquarters adopted a temporary auxiliary stretcher method of relaying and transporting the wounded, using work as a form of relief. According to preliminary results of experiments in old liberated areas and semi-old areas (including newly recovered semi-old areas), if organized well, this method can save manpower and expenses by twenty times compared to the previous method of using only permanent stretchers to transport the wounded directly from the forward dressing station to the rear hospital.\n\nThe auxiliary stretcher system transforms the previously military-affiliated wounded transfer stations into local ones, under the leadership of the Support-the-Front Headquarters. Its organizational form involves setting up a sub-station every thirty or thirty-five miles along the transfer line, coordinating with the village government to organize the masses locally to prepare stretchers, and allocating them according to the number of wounded. This type of stretcher is specifically used for transferring the wounded. During combat, the stretcher-bearers of the company rescue the wounded from the front line and hand them over to the permanent military stretcher team, which transports the wounded to the forward dressing station. Then, the auxiliary stretchers relay them station by station to the rear hospital.\n\nThe advantage of the auxiliary stretcher is that it allows permanent stretchers to focus on transporting from the battlefield to the dressing station, saving a large amount of manpower. For example, during the six or seven months of operations on the Tianjin-Pukou Line, the transfer station used auxiliary stretchers, with five people per set, giving out a total of fifteen catties of work grain per day. If permanent stretchers were used entirely, with each person serving for two months, the manpower and grain would exceed about twenty times (not including firewood). Auxiliary stretchers are allocated as needed, thus overcoming the waste of the past, where some permanent stretchers were idle for two or three months. On the other hand, this type of stretcher does not detach from production. For example, if they depart after supper, travel sixty or seventy miles to the next station and back, they can return before midnight, and can still continue production the next day, and also get grain, so it is willingly accepted by the masses. For example, the masses in the Loude District of Taining (a newly established county, part of Tai'an and Ningyang) voluntarily provided 1,200 stretchers even during the wheat harvest.\n\nRegarding the organization and mobilization of auxiliary stretchers, the transfer station has gained the following preliminary experience in the trial implementation: First, the transfer station should establish close ties with the local government (mainly the district government) and maintain contact with the county. For example, the Taining County Party Committee assigned the task of organizing auxiliary stretchers at the district party secretary meeting, with the district party secretary or district head serving as the chief station master, responsible for mobilization, education, and other political responsibilities. The cadres of the transfer station are mainly responsible for liaison, handover, accounting, and other specific tasks, but they must also personally engage in mass work and cooperate with the government to conduct current affairs and support-the-front education for village cadres and the masses in order to lay a good foundation. In this way, when it is necessary to open up a new transfer line, the original transfer station can be entrusted to the local authorities. In old or semi-old areas, the organization of this type of auxiliary stretcher can be based on the original village organization. At the same time, when the wounded arrive at the station, while they are changing dressings and eating (handled by the attached medical personnel), someone must be sent to notify the next station of the number of wounded in advance, so that the next station can prepare stretchers in time, so as to avoid delays due to lack of prior preparation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 鲁中创接力辅助担架　节约民力和开支达二十倍\n\n1948-09-11\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　鲁中创接力辅助担架\n  　节约民力和开支达二十倍\n    【新华社华东八日电】解放军在津浦前线徐济段作战时，鲁中支前司令部所属之转运总站，采取以工代赈的按站接力运送伤员的临时辅助担架。据在老区、半老区（包括刚收复的半老区）试验初步结果，如组织得好，可较以往全部使用常备担架从前方包扎所直达后方医院这种方法节省民力和开支达二十倍。\n    辅助担架系将过去属于军队系统的伤员转运站变为地方性的，由支前司令部领导。其组织形式是在转运线上每隔三十里或三十五里设立分站，协同村政府就地组织群众准备担架，看伤员多少随时支拨。此种担架专用于转运伤员。战斗中，连队的担架兵把伤员枪救出火线后，交给常备随军担架团，由担架团将伤员运至前方包扎所，再由辅助担架按站转运至后方医院。\n    辅助担架的优点在于：可使常备担架专门负责由战地至包扎所的担运而节约大批民力。例如在津浦线作战六、七两月中，转运总站使用辅助担架，每付五人，每天共支给工粮十五斤。如果完全使用常备担架，以每人服务两个月计，则民力、粮食均超过约二十倍（柴草尚不在内）。辅助担架乃按需要随时支拨，因此克服了过去有的常备担架两三个月中没事做的浪费现象。另一方面，这种担架不脱离生产。如吃过下午饭出发，至下一站往返六、七十里，半夜前即可返回，第二天仍可照旧生产，又能得粮食，因此为群众所乐意接受。如泰宁（新设县，泰安、宁阳各一部）楼德区群众正当麦收时，仍自愿出担架一千二百付。\n    关于辅助担架的组织与动员，转运总站在试行中得出以下初步经验：首先转运站应与地方政府（主要是区政府）取得密切结合，与县取得联络。如泰宁县委把辅助担架的组织任务在分区书记会议上布置，由分区书记或区长任正站长，负责动员教育等政治责任；转运站干部主要负责联络、交替、算帐等具体业务，但也必须亲自下手去作群众工作，配合政权对村干、群众进行时事和支前教育，以求打下良好基础。这样，在需要开辟新转运线时，即可将原有的转运站委托给地方负责。在老区或半老区，此种辅助担架之组织可以原有村组织为基础。同时在伤员到达站时，趁换药吃饭之际（由附设之医务人员负责），必须派人先往下一站通知伤员人数，使下一站能及时准备担架，以免事先无准备而拖延时间。"

    "content": "(Taihang Dispatch) River floods are rampant, and the water disaster is severe. The disaster victims in the liberated areas of northern Henan and the areas ruled by the Kuomintang are experiencing two extremely different situations. When the river water rose sharply in late last month and the banks burst, the cadres of democratic governments at all levels in the Fourth and Fifth Administrative Regions of northern Henan braved the rain and water, led the masses to forcibly block the breaches, eliminated the pessimistic mood of the masses, and organized support from the non-disaster areas. Finally, within a short period of less than a week, they blocked all of the hundreds of breaches in the Qin River, Mang River, Guangji River, Yunliang River, Zhang River, Qi River, Anyang River, Dan River, Fuyang River, and Wei River within the borders of Xiuwu, Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, Wen County, Qinyang, Xinxiang, Ji County, Hui County, Qi County, Zhangnan, Ye County, and Anyang. The county magistrate and county secretary of Zhangnan County personally led the work, and nineteen breaches were closed within seven or eight days. A total of 30,000 civilian laborers were mobilized, costing nearly 20 million yuan and 180,000 jin of wheat. The Sixth District of the county also awarded 10,000 jin of wheat to those who were exemplary in blocking the breaches and repairing the dikes. At the same time, a large amount of relief grain and loans were distributed to urgently relieve the disaster victims, and they were organized to engage in production for self-salvation. The Fifth Administrative Office allocated 50,000 jin of grain, and the severely affected areas of Jiaozuo Xiuwu also provided loans of nearly 10 million yuan and more than 6,000 jin of grain. On August 2, the Fourth Administrative Office also held a meeting to inspect the flood control and disaster relief work, and assigned cadres to go to the countryside to carry out disaster relief work. In addition to planting turnips and other autumn vegetables on more than 40,000 mu of flooded land in the Sixth and Ninth Districts of Hui County, the masses were also mobilized to open up more than 30 hectares of ripe wasteland in Luozhuang and other villages, most of which were also planted with autumn vegetables. Loans of 45 million yuan were issued to organize disaster victims to engage in sideline production such as livestock trading, weaving, and saltpeter boiling. Through active rescue and relief, more than 500,000 disaster victims in northern Henan were given a way out. The disaster victims said with emotion: \"The Communist Party and the democratic government are really our saviors. If the government hadn't led us to block the river breaches, we wouldn't have our lives.\" Now, while carrying out production for self-salvation, the river dikes are being consolidated to prevent further flooding. The disaster victims in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, who suffered the same disaster, are displaced and dying in the rolling floodwaters. The Chiang Kai-shek party personnel sit idly by. The masses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas on the south bank of the Dan River in Xinxiang saw that the people in the liberated areas on the north bank were actively rescuing the flood under the leadership of the democratic government, and said painfully: \"When a breach occurs, people (referring to the democratic government) think of ways to block the water and provide loans for relief; no one cares about us here!\" Helpless, they fled to the liberated areas with the old and the young. Only 680 people fled to the Ninth District of Hui County and the First and Fifth Districts of Xiuwu. The democratic government gave them warm condolences and resettled them. After the Mulandi Qin River Bridge was destroyed by the Chiang bandits in mid-June last year, although our army and civilians rushed to repair it, it could not be repaired due to repeated obstruction by the Chiang bandits. This time, the Qin River breached again from here. Forty-two villages within thirty miles around Xiuwu City and forty miles from east to west in the Kuomintang-controlled area suffered, and nearly 10,000 people were affected. In Xiaohan Village, which has less than 100 people in total, more than 60 people were washed away by the flood. The disaster victims in Changqiao did not eat for three days on the branches of trees. The local disaster victims gathered more than 200 people, holding pitchforks and iron shovels, crossed the Qin River and arrived at the West Gate of Xiuwu City, demanding that the puppet county magistrate Xu Jingshan exempt them from grain and conscription and provide relief to the people, but Xu stood on the city tower and prevaricated the disaster victims. More than 100 disaster victims in Huaifeng Township, forced by hunger, angrily spread the word: \"It's death if we don't starve, anyway, we'll risk our lives to fight the dog people (referring to the Chiang puppets).\" They crowded outside the village, demanding relief from the puppet township chief Guo Qinghe. Guo ignored them. The disaster victims angrily broke into the township office and robbed all the rice and flour.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一样水灾两种境遇  蒋区灾民扶老携幼到处逃难　我区抢救有方生活都有保证\n\n1948-09-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一样水灾两种境遇\n    蒋区灾民扶老携幼到处逃难\n  　我区抢救有方生活都有保证\n    【太行电】河洪泛滥，水灾深重。豫北解放区和国民党统治区的灾民，经遇着两种极不同的境遇。当上月下旬，河水暴涨，决堤时，我豫北四、五分区各级民主政府干部，即冒雨涉水，率领群众强行堵口，扫除群众悲观情绪，组织非灾区群众支援，终在不满一周的短促时间内，将修武、博爱、焦作、温县、沁阳、新乡、汲县、辉县、淇县、漳南、邺县、安阳境内之沁河、漭河、广济河、运粮河、漳河、淇河、安阳河、丹河、滏阳河、卫河等上百处决口，全部堵住。漳南县长、县书亲自领导，十九处决口在七八天内即告堵竣。共动用民力三万个，费洋近两千万，麦子十八万斤。该县六区并以一万斤小麦，奖励了堵口修堤的模范者。同时并发放大批救济粮、贷款急赈灾民，和组织其生产自救。计五专署即拨粮五万斤，焦作修获武严重地区亦贷款近千万元，粮食六千多斤。四专署于八月二日又召开会议，检查治水救灾工作，分派干部下乡进行救灾工作。辉县六、九区除将四万余亩被淹田地种上蔓菁等秋菜外，并发动群众到罗庄等村开熟荒三十余顷，亦大部种上秋菜。发放贷款四千五百万元，组织灾民贩牲口、纺织、熬硝等副业生产。经过积极的抢堵救济，豫北五十万以上的灾民得到了生路，灾民感动的说：“共产党、民主政府真是咱的救命恩人，要不是政府带领咱堵河口，哪里还有咱的命在。”现在对群众一面进行生产自救，一面继续巩固河堤，防止再泛。遭受同样灾难的国民党统治区灾民，即在黄水滚滚的灾难里流离失所，奄奄待毙。蒋党人员坐视不理。新乡丹河南岸国民党统治区群众，看到北岸解放区人民在民主政府领导下积极抢救水灾，痛心的说：“冲开口人家（指民主政府）想法堵水，又贷款救济；咱这里谁管哩！”无奈何即扶老携幼纷纷逃来解放区，仅逃到辉县九区与修武一、五区的即有六百八十人。民主政府当热情慰问安置。去年六月中旬木栾店沁河大桥被蒋匪破坏后，虽经我军民抢修，但因蒋匪一再阻扰，未能修筑，此次沁河又从此处决口，国民党统治区修武城周卫北三十里，东西四十里之四十二个村，近万人民遭难。小韩村一共不到一百口人，即被水冲走六十多口。常桥灾民在树枝上三天未吃饭，当地灾民集合二百余人，手持杈把铁锹渡过沁水，到达修武城西关，要求伪县长徐景山，免除派粮派丁，救济国民，但徐却高踏城楼支吾灾民。怀封乡灾民百余人为饥饿所逼，愤怒相传：“不饿也是死，反正冒着死跟狗人（指蒋伪）拼一下。”齐拥寨外，要求伪乡长郭清河救济，郭不理，灾民一怒打进了乡公所，把米面全部抢去。"

The Northeast delegates attending the National Labor Conference were also the delegates attending the Northeast Workers' Representative Conference; therefore, the opening and closing ceremonies were combined with the Labor Conference. After the opening ceremony, the delegates participated in the agenda of the Labor Conference. After the Labor Conference concluded its agenda on national issues on the 13th of last month, the Northeast Workers' Representative Conference formally discussed issues related to the Northeast workers' movement. Non-Northeast delegates attending the Labor Conference also participated in the sessions.\n\nFrom the 14th onwards, the conference successively listened to and discussed reports by Guo Linjun on the \"Regulations on Production Emulation Campaign in Northeast Public Enterprises,\" Chen Yu on the draft \"Provisional Wartime Labor Insurance Regulations for Northeast Public Enterprises,\" Zhang Weizhen on the outline of the \"Wartime Labor Regulations of Harbin,\" and Tang Yunchao on the \"Charter of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions.\" The conference approved the aforementioned reports in principle on the 21st. The outline of the Wartime Labor Regulations of Harbin was formulated based on the principles of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital within the New Democratic economic policy. Originally named the Labor Law Outline, it was proposed by the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in February this year and passed at the Harbin Workers' Representative Conference on May 1st. It has now been revised according to the spirit of Comrade Chen Yun's report on the current tasks of the workers' movement. Because it is wartime and of a trial nature, it has been renamed the Labor Regulations Outline. During the discussion, the Hegang delegation proposed that these regulations be used as the wartime labor regulations for the Northeast Liberated Area, and the conference decided to submit them to the Executive Committee of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast Administrative Committee for discussion and decision. The Charter of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions was formulated according to the spirit of the Charter of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and in accordance with the local conditions in the Northeast.\n\nOn the 20th, the conference elected the Executive Committee of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. A total of 71 executive committee members were elected, including 47 official members and 24 alternate members.

    "date": "1948-09-12",

    "content": "[Jinzhong Telegram] Jiaocheng's urban industrial and commercial sectors originally included 92 workshops and shops, such as handicraft workshops, stores, fur shops, Chinese medicine shops, and general merchandise stores. After liberation, with the support of the democratic government, all of them resumed business in just one month. Moreover, one stationery store, one inn, one hospital, two general merchandise stores, five restaurants, 34 stalls, and dozens of mobile vendors were newly added. Merchants who had fled under the tyrannical rule of the Yan bandit regime have also returned to open businesses. The Dongshahe Market has been established. The trading center near the city关 (guān, gate/pass, can also refer to a city gate area), the number of vendors and people attending the market exceeds twice the number during the period of bandit occupation. During the Yan bandit's rule, there were numerous heavy taxes, and the burden on industry and commerce was extremely heavy. In addition, the practice of integrating soldiers and merchants was implemented, with two out of every six people being drafted as standing soldiers, and the remaining people doing hard labor every day, building projects, digging trenches, and carrying bricks, making it impossible for various businesses to operate. After the democratic government entered the city, it resolutely implemented the policy of protecting industry and commerce. When accepting materials from the Yan bandit's government-run stores, it strictly distinguished the private shares within them. For example, cloth from the Jinquanchang store that was deposited in the Yan puppet grain and tax office was returned after verification. For private businesses and private shares in public enterprises, as well as private shares and private property of Yan puppet personnel who fled due to oppression by the Yan bandits, the democratic government properly protected them and posted announcements explaining that the original amounts were sealed up and entrusted to their neighbors or relatives for safekeeping, waiting for them to return and claim them. For example, the Grain Joint Cooperative, Cultural Supply Cooperative, Cultural Service Cooperative, and People's Transportation Cooperative run by the Yan bandits, the government has announced that all private property still belongs to the individuals. For example, the eight packages of Kang Shaoxu from Duancun stored in the Grain Joint Cooperative remained untouched. Kang took them all away after finding a witness. At the beginning of liberation, merchants still had some doubts about the democratic government's industrial and commercial policies. After the government's Bureau of Industry and Commerce repeatedly explained and interpreted them, the cadres of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce visited each household. At the same time, they stabilized prices, established grain stores to regulate people's food, and issued loans of 15 million yuan (farmers' currency) to coal kilns, which can now produce 12,000 catties of coal per day. Various industries in the urban area have successively opened for business, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. At the beginning of liberation, farmers' currency was extremely scarce, and transactions were mostly done with grain, and even silver dollars were used, causing market chaos. Later, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce established a Jinzhong Grain Store outlet and supplied various daily necessities, which increased the credibility of the farmers' currency and lowered prices. From July 11th to 21st, the price of one foot of white cloth dropped from 60,000 yuan to 28,000 yuan in ten days. The price of a towel dropped from 130,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. One catty of white flour dropped from 30,000 yuan to 16,000 yuan. One dou of millet, which used to cost 300,000 yuan, can now be bought for 160,000 yuan. Other prices have also been greatly reduced compared to before. Saltpeter used to be controlled by the Yan bandits, and each catty of saltpeter was only given 20,000 yuan in Chiang's currency, which could only buy a pack of cigarettes. Now all saltpeter workshops are privately operated. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce purchases it for 20,000 yuan in farmers' currency per catty, which can buy two catties of wheat. The enthusiasm of the workers for production has greatly increased. Zhang Zhisheng, a shoemaker in Dongguan, said: \"In the past, I worked hard for others every day and still had to go hungry. Now I can make four pairs of shoes a day, and each pair of shoes can earn 30,000 yuan in labor costs. My family has enough to eat and even has some left over.\" The People's Transportation Cooperative was preparing to close down when it was first liberated, and the original 70 catties of gasoline were also sold to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. After the Bureau of Industry and Commerce explained that the gasoline was converted into 8.69 million yuan, they used the money to buy a cargo truck and continued to operate.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 交城正确执行工商业政策　原有行商全部复业　新开铺面陆续增加\n\n1948-09-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　交城正确执行工商业政策\n  　原有行商全部复业\n  　新开铺面陆续增加\n    【晋中电】交城城关工商业，原有作坊商店皮货行药材行杂货行等九十二家。解放后在民主政府扶植下仅一个月即全部恢复营业，且新增文具行、店房、医院各一家，杂货行两家，饭铺五家，摊贩三十四家，流动摊贩数十家，在阎匪暴政下逃走的商贩也都回来开张营业。东沙河市关集已成立。城关附近的交易中心，摊贩与赶集的群众超过匪占期间二倍以上。阎匪统治时苛税繁多，工商业负担极为严重，加以实行兵商合一，六人中抽二人当常备兵，其余的人每天做苦工、修工事、挖壕沟、背砖头，使各商号无法营业。民主政府入城后坚决执行了保护工商业的政策，在接受阎匪官办商店物资时，严格分清其中的私商股份。如晋泉昌商号寄放在阎伪钱粮行的布匹，经证实后即退还。对因受阎匪欺压而逃亡的私人商号及公营企业中的私人股本，以及阎伪人员的私人股本，私人财物，民主政府均妥为保护，并张贴告白说明原数封存，交其邻人或亲友代管，等他们回来领取。如阎匪办的粮联社、文化供应社、文化服务社、民众旅运社等，政府已宣布所有私人财物仍归本人所有。如段村康少煦存放在粮联社的八个包袱原封未动，康找到证明人即全部取走。初解放时商人们对民主政府的工商业政策还有些怀疑，经政府工商局反复说明解释，工商局干部挨门逐户的进行访问，同时平抑物价，设立粮店调剂民食，发放煤窑贷款一千五百万元（农币），现每日可出煤一万二千斤。城关各业陆续开张营业，市面日趋繁荣。初解放时农币极缺，交易多用粮食，甚至使用白洋，造成市场混乱现象。后经工商局设立晋中粮店门市部，并供给各种日用品，农币威信提高，物价也随之下降。七月十一日至二十一日十天内白洋布一尺由六万元减至二万八千元。毛巾每条由十三万元降至六万元。一斤白面由三万元降至一万六千元。小米三十万元一斗现在十六万元即可买一斗。其他物价均较前大为降低，盐硝过去受阎匪统制，每斤硝只给蒋币两万元，仅能买一支纸烟，现在所有硝房都由私营。工商局收购每斤给二万元农币，可买二斤小麦。工人们生产情绪大为提高。东关做鞋工人张之盛说：“过去天天给人作苦工，还得饿肚子，现在一天可揽四双鞋，一双鞋可赚手工钱三万元，一家人吃饭还有余。”民众旅运社刚解放时准备停业，原有七十斤汽油也卖给工商局，轻工商局解释将汽油折价八百六十九万元后，又用此钱买了一部货物，继续经营起来。"

Originally from Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, he was born in Qingxian County, Hebei Province. He enlisted in the army at a young age and rose through the ranks to become a battalion commander, regimental commander, brigade commander, division commander, and military governor. He participated in the Xinhai Revolution and the campaign against Zhang Xun. In the winter of 1924, he established the National Army and served as its commander-in-chief. He went to the Soviet Union in early 1926 and returned to China in September. Until the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in 1927, he cooperated with the Chinese Communist Party and helped develop the revolutionary movement in Shaanxi and other regions. Although he later broke away from the revolutionary camp for a time, he was ostracized by Chiang Kai-shek. In May 1933, he organized the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, which was also defeated due to Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage. In the winter of 1935, he served as the Vice Chairman of the Military Commission of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, but held no real power. Later, due to disagreements with Chiang Kai-shek, he was removed from his post. In September 1946, he was sent to the United States by Chiang Kai-shek under the guise of \"Special Envoy for Water Conservancy Inspection.\" While in the United States, Feng openly opposed Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government, which was welcomed by the Chinese people but naturally hated by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, who revoked his title as special envoy and expelled him from the Kuomintang. When the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was established this New Year's Day, he was elected Chairman of the Political Committee of the association. He left the United States to return to China this August, and died in a ship fire in the Black Sea on August 31.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冯玉祥氏略历\n\n1948-09-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冯玉祥氏略历\n    【新华社陕北八日电】冯玉祥氏略历：冯玉祥，字焕章，六十八岁。原籍安徽巢县，生于河北青县。自幼入伍，历升营长、团长、旅长、师长、督军等职，曾参加辛亥革命、讨伐张勋等役。一九二四年冬成立国民军，任总司令。一九二六年初去苏联，九月返国，直至一九二七年国共分裂以前，曾经与中国共产党合作，帮助了陕西等地革命运动的发展。其后虽曾一度脱离革命阵营，但受到蒋介石的排斥。一九三三年五月组织察北抗日同盟军，亦因蒋介石的破坏而失败。一九三五年冬任南京国民党军事委员会副委员长，迄无实权，后因主张与蒋介石不合，被去职。一九四六年九月，以“考察水利专使”的名义被蒋介石遣往美国。冯在美公开反对蒋介石的独裁政府，受到中国人民的欢迎，却很自然地受到蒋介石匪帮的痛恨，被撤消了专使名义，并被开除国民党党籍。今年元旦中国国民党革命委员会成立时，被选为该会政治委员会主席。今年八月离美返国，八月三十一日行至黑海，因轮船起火遇难。"

    "content": "Various Regions Actively Implement the Guiding Principles of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference\n　　Rectify Enterprises and Improve Production\n　　[Report from this newspaper] Since the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, public and private enterprises and industrial and commercial management departments in various parts of North China have begun to carry out inspections and rectifications. According to reports from various regions, the common bias in industrial and commercial management is to deal with urban problems from a rural perspective, mechanically transplanting rural struggle forms and production mutual aid organizational forms into all industrial and commercial enterprises, which seriously hinders the development of industry and commerce. In Changzhi City, various independent laborers and handicraft workshops were forcibly organized into mutual aid groups for collective operation, or mass funds were forcibly invested in private shops to change them into cooperative societies. Regardless of their production technology, cadres and activists were arbitrarily sent to serve as managers and accountants, and in some cases, poor and lower-middle peasants were sent to private shops to serve as \"backbones.\" This has forced many industries to become depressed or collapse. In some mining areas in Wu'an, the \"poor and lower-middle peasant line\" was also emphasized, disregarding costs, raising wages, and lowering coal prices. Even if the coal baskets made by rural peasants were of extremely poor quality, factories were forced to purchase them at high prices, ostensibly to take care of mass production. Some village cadres in Yangquan City insisted on introducing workers to factories and stipulating wages. This spring, the policy was corrected, and the above phenomena were corrected in most areas. Compensation was also made to the industrialists and businessmen who had been struggled against. According to statistics from the 9th Sub-district of Central Hebei, a total of 1,490 industrialists and businessmen were infringed upon. By June, 1,235 had been corrected, 124 were being corrected, and only 41 had not been corrected. Another aspect of the rural perspective is the lack of attention to scientific management, one-sided emphasis on the immediate interests of the masses, and a lack of long-term construction concepts. Many coal mines in Yangquan only proceed from the current lives of the workers, arbitrarily mining and excavating, without regard for coal mine safety. In many areas of North Yue, no one repairs the factory buildings and shops that are borrowed or rented. General production management lacks long-term planning and does not focus on economic development. According to the inspections of the Taihang and Taiyue regions' industry and commerce conferences, industrial and commercial management departments have always emphasized taxation and neglected production. In the border areas, it is simply confiscation without actively organizing exports, while in the inland market, it is simply control. As late as recently in Gaoping, there were cases of arbitrarily increasing industrial and commercial taxes by 5 million yuan in order to increase fiscal revenue. In some areas of North Yue, industrial and commercial taxes even exceeded 34 percent of net profit (the North China Industry and Commerce Conference stipulated that it should not exceed 20 percent), and this has not been corrected. The operation of public and private enterprises underwent preliminary rectification this spring in various regions. The main problems were: first, wages were too high and the wage system was egalitarian; second, there were too many non-production personnel, and factory management was unreasonable and unscientific. The former has been widely abolished in various regions, and a fixed wage system has been adopted instead of the supply system, but unreasonable situations have not been completely eliminated. According to a survey of factories in Changzhi City, taking the pre-war period as a base, only individual factories were slightly lower than before the war, and the rest were increased to between 131 and 375 percent. In addition, there were supplementary wages that accounted for 80 percent of the formal wages. A factory in Taiyue was four times higher than before the war. Moreover, the wages of light industry are generally higher than those of heavy industry, and the difference between various different labor intensities, skilled workers and general workers and apprentices is also too small. In some coal mines in Yangquan City, wages are still determined according to the family composition of the workers. Non-production personnel account for a large proportion in various regions. In the Central Hebei region, they account for about 21 percent of the personnel in each factory. In the public-operated factories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, they account for one-quarter, and in some cases, they account for half. In some factories in Taiyue, they account for one-third. In a factory in Taihang, there were only 30 workers, but there were 32 non-production personnel. Following this anti-enterprise production organization, various phenomena of wasted working hours and materials arose. In the Yonghua Chemical Plant in Central Hebei, only 15 percent of the formal production workers were working every day in May and June. In another factory, the actual production time was only two hours a day. In the public-operated factories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, the formal production workers only reached 89.4 percent in June. Recently, various regions have been gradually improving. The egalitarianism of the wage system has been overcome more quickly, and wages have been generally evaluated according to labor intensity and production technology. Some factories in Shijiazhuang City have adopted a reasonable cross-progressive wage system, while most other regions have adopted piece-rate wages. Non-production personnel have also been greatly reduced. The management of various factories has largely implemented a strict economic accounting and cost accounting system, correcting the previous waste and chaos. According to statistics from the public-operated factories in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, the actual working hours of each factory have increased by 18 percent recently, and production efficiency has increased by 16 percent in some cases, and by 27.7 percent in others. Since the implementation of the cost accounting system, the cost of a match factory in Central Hebei has gradually decreased. Taking March as a base, the cost decreased to 88.9 percent in April, 81.7 percent in May, and 71.2 percent in June. In a factory in Taiyue, the cost was reduced by half. At present, industrial and commercial departments in various regions are still studying and improving in order to continue to correct policies and implement the guiding principles of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 各地积极贯彻华北工商会议方针　整顿企业提高生产\n\n1948-09-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　各地积极贯彻华北工商会议方针\n  　整顿企业提高生产\n    【本报讯】华北各地公私企业及工商管理部门，自华北工商会议之后，均着手进行检查整顿。据各地报导：工商管理上的普遍偏向，为以农村观点处理城市问题，机械搬运农村斗争形式与生产互助组织形式到一切工商企业中去，严重地妨害了工商业发展。长治市曾强制各种独立劳动者和手工作坊，编成互助组集体经营，或向私人商店强行投入群众资金，改为合作社性质，并且不论其生产技术如何，随便派干部积极分子去当经理、会计，有的竟派贫雇农民到私人商店中去当“骨干”，这样逼使某些行业萧条或垮台者不少。武安有些矿区也强调“贫雇路线”，不顾成本，提高工资，减低煤价，乡村农民所制煤篓质量极坏，也得强制工厂以高价购买，名为照顾群众生产。阳泉市有些村干部硬给工厂介绍工人，规定工资。今春端正政策，曾对上述现象进行纠正，大部地区均已克服，被斗争的工商业也进行赔偿，据冀中九分区统计，被侵犯的工商业共一千四百九十家，至六月份已纠正一千二百三十五家，正在纠正的一百廿四家，未纠正的只四十一家。农村观点的另一方面，便是不重视科学管理，片面强调群众眼前利益，缺乏长期建设观念。阳泉的许多煤矿，只从目前工人的生活出发，随便开采挖掘，毫不顾及煤矿安全。北岳许多地区借住或租用的厂屋铺面坏了也无人修理，一般生产管理都缺乏长期计划，不是从发展经济着眼。据太行、太岳两区工商会议检查，工商管理部门一向着重税收，轻视生产。在边地是单纯没收，未积极组织输出，在内地市场又是单纯统制。高平直至最近，还有为增加财政收入，而擅自加派工商业税五百万元的事。北岳有些地区的工商业税，竟超过纯利百分之三十四（华北工商会议规定，不得超过百分之二十），而未改正。公私企业的经营，今年春间各地均曾进行初步整顿，主要问题，一是工资过高，及工资制度的平均主义；一是非生产人员过多，及工厂管理的不合理、不科学。前者各地已普遍废除供给制度采取定额工资制，但不合理情形还未完全肃清。长治市各工厂调查，以抗战前为基数，只个别工厂比战前略低，余皆提高至百分之一百三十一至三百七十五，此外尚有占正式工资达百分之八十的附属工资。太岳某厂比战前提高四倍。而且轻工业工资，一般竟比重工业为高，各种不同的劳动强度，技术工人与一般工人和学徒之间差额也太小，阳泉市某些煤矿，至今还有按工人家庭成份定工资者。非生产人员各地都占很大比重，冀中区约占各厂人员百分之二十一，冀鲁豫各公营工厂合计，占四分之一，其中有的竟占一半，太岳有些工厂占三分之一，太行某工厂全部工人只三十人，非生产人员却有三十二人。跟着这种反企业化的生产组织，各种浪费工时、材料现象随之而生，冀中永华化学厂五、六两月每天只有百分之十五的正式生产工，另一工厂每天实在生产时间只有二个钟头，冀鲁豫各公营工厂六月份合计，正式生产工也只达百分之八十九点四。最近各地已在逐渐改善，工资制度的平均主义克服比较迅速，普遍已按照劳动强度，生产技术评议工资。石家庄市有些工厂并已采用合理的交叉累进工资制，其他各地则多数采用计件工资。非生产人员也大大裁减，各工厂管理已大部实行严格的经济核算与成本计算制，纠正以前的浪费混乱现象。据冀鲁豫各公营工厂统计，最近各厂实用工时已增加百分之十八，生产效率有的提高了百分之十六，有的则提高至百分之二十七点七。冀中某火柴厂自实行成本计算制度以后，成本已逐渐降低，若以三月份为基数，四月份成本降低至百分之八十八点九，五月份降低至百分之八十一点七，六月份降低至百分之七十一点二。太岳某厂，成本降低一倍。现各地工商部门为继续端正政策，贯彻华北工商会议方针，仍在研究改进。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "A Guerrilla Unit Persisting North of the Daqing River\n\n　　A certain district in Baxian County, Jizhong Tenth Military Sub-district, used to be our old base area. Since the enemy began \"sweeping\" north of the Daqing River in August of last year, the bandit Wang Fenggang has built towers and dug trenches along the Daqing River embankment and the Heping Highway, \"searching and suppressing\" and \"sifting and selecting\" day and night. To fight the enemy and defend their homes, the village cadres and militiamen of this area organized a guerrilla unit. In constant combat, they have gradually developed into an organized and disciplined armed work team.\n\n　　The guerrilla unit frequently cooperated with district cadres to penetrate behind enemy lines, conducting high-altitude broadcasts, shouting slogans around towers, and writing slogans to launch extensive political offensives, exposing the rumors and deceptions of bandit Wang and bringing hope to the suffering people. In the tense environment of bandit Wang’s “sweeping” and “suppression,” they continued to break in and out, propagandizing to the masses, educating puppet office personnel, and attacking small groups of enemies who were seizing grain and conscripting soldiers.\n\n　　This spring, the guerrilla unit fought a battle in Gonggang, rescuing more than twenty farmers who had been captured by the enemy. They sheltered the masses during spring plowing in a certain village and helped the landlord with his work. They engaged in public buying and selling in the enemy-occupied areas, without violating regulations. In Niugang, Baxian County, they repelled the enemy who were conscripting soldiers, and the villagers offered them cigarettes, which they declined. During the New Year, they fought a battle in Suqiao, Baxian County, and the masses voluntarily offered them white flour, but they were considerate of the people's suffering and returned the flour intact, earning the enthusiastic praise of the broad masses.\n\n　　During campaigns, the guerrilla unit actively cooperated with the main forces in combat, capturing fleeing enemies. Last September, when our army counterattacked the enemy, the guerrilla unit captured two machine guns and two rifles and took three prisoners in Gonggang (southwest of Baxian). When escorting the prisoners, they observed battlefield discipline and patiently educated the prisoners. When escorting stretchers, they helped the laborers lift and lower them gently, taking care of the wounded by taking their excrement and urine, showing a deep concern for the wounded. They were commended by the logistics command of the military sub-district.\n\n　　On April 2nd, they cooperated with the local armed forces to attack Chaheji (southwest of Baxian). After the battle began, Wang Yantian of the guerrilla unit bravely rushed forward, killing an enemy with a bayonet and then killing a puppet company commander. Chen Zhongyuan and Wu Huichen shouted \"Those who lay down their arms will not be killed!\" while searching the courtyard. After capturing a prisoner, they immediately educated the prisoner to shout slogans. Chen Zhongyuan also bravely rushed into a house and seized a light machine gun. Niu Tiemai of the Second Squad saw a group of enemies trying to break through and shot down two of them with one shot. In just ten minutes, the battle was over, and all seventy-one enemies were wiped out. In this battle, the guerrilla unit independently captured thirty-five enemies and obtained a light machine gun and seventeen rifles, without any casualties.\n\n　　The activities and tactics of the guerrilla unit were active and proactive, resourceful and brave, acting according to circumstances, and taking action when appropriate, and retreating when not. The enemy forced the masses in each village to signal \"Red lights for the arrival of the Eighth Route Army staff, torches for the arrival of the field army.\" The guerrilla unit used this trick to their advantage, spreading out to light torches everywhere in the villages, scaring the enemy into not daring to come out for four or five days, thus thwarting the enemy's scheme. The cunning enemy would come out secretly during the night and openly during the day. The guerrilla unit grasped the enemy's pattern and secretly ambushed them. In Fengcun, Baxian County, an ambush killed three enemies, wounded one, and obtained two rifles. When the enemy secretly dispersed and hid during the night, the guerrilla unit would gather and launch a sudden search and suppression. The guerrilla unit also proposed \"Three Don'ts:\" \"Don't attack if the target is unclear, don't attack if not accurate, don't attack if you can't win.\" One night, they encountered the puppet exiled county government of Xin town, wounding four enemies and rescuing fifteen village cadres who had been detained. The guerrilla unit's unpredictable actions completely foiled Wang Bandit’s Seventh Regiment’s (now reorganized into the First Brigade, First Regiment) boast of eliminating the district guerrilla unit. Small groups of enemies no longer dared to move easily at night.\n\n　　Relying on the leadership of the Party and the support of the people, and with the active assistance of the local armed forces, all the members of the guerrilla unit have achieved considerable success through their heroic struggles day and night. From August 20th of last year to April 10th of this year, they fought a total of fifty battles, large and small, destroying twenty-two blockhouses and碉堡, eliminating one hundred and eight enemies below the battalion commander level, and capturing one 82mm mortar, three light machine guns, thirty long and short guns, and some grain, horses, and other military supplies. They have played a significant role in restoring work in the areas they persisted in. They have been commended by a circular from the leaders of the Jizhong Military Region.

According to statistics from Jiyuan, Anze, Qinyuan, Fushan, and other counties, 424 people have been injured by wolves, and the damage to sheep flocks is even greater. In Xishan Village, Yangcheng, forty-two sheep were killed or injured by wolves in one night. As a result, children, women, semi-able-bodied and even fully-able-bodied laborers are afraid to go to the fields alone, which greatly affects production and causes great harm. In order to organize the masses to hunt wolves, solve the difficulties in wolf hunting, and encourage the masses to hunt wolves, the Taiyue Administrative Office and the Military Affairs Committee have issued the following instructions: (1) Counties plagued by wolves should convene meetings of hunters to exchange wolf hunting experience. Militiamen should form the backbone, with hunters participating, to organize hunting and defense. (2) Gunpowder and iron sand should be manufactured or purchased by the Military Affairs Committee and then resold to hunters. Those who buy or manufacture gunpowder can borrow funds temporarily from the local county if they have capital difficulties. (3) To reward the masses for hunting wolves, it is specifically stipulated that a reward of five dou of millet will be given for each wolf killed, and for digging out a wolf den, five dou of rice will be awarded for each adult wolf and two and a half dou of rice for each wolf pup. Individuals who kill more than five wolves will be given the honorary title of \"Wolf Hunting Hero\" by the government, and will also receive a heavy reward. Groups that kill more than ten wolves will also be awarded the honorary title of \"Wolf Hunting Model Group\" by the government, and will also receive a heavy reward. Cadres at all levels who have made outstanding achievements in organizing wolf hunting will be rewarded by governments at all levels.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太岳行署奖励打狼\n\n1948-09-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太岳行署奖励打狼\n    【太岳电】太岳行署、武委总会联合指示各专县组织群众消灭狼害。据济源、安泽、沁源、浮山等县统计，先后被狼伤害四百廿四人，羊群受害更大。阳城西山村一夜被狼咬死咬伤羊四十二只。以致儿童妇女半劳力甚至全劳力不敢单独上地，影响生产为害很大。为组织群众打狼，解决打狼中的困难，鼓励群众打狼，太岳行署与武总特作如下指示：（一）闹狼县份召集猎户会议，交流打狼经验，以民兵为骨干，有猎户参加，组织打防。（二）火药铁砂由武委会找人制造或购买再转卖给猎户。购买制火药的人，如资本困难可由各该县地方在内暂借。（三）为奖励群众打狼，特规定打住一只狼奖五斗小米，刨出狼窝的，大狼一只奖米五斗，小狼奖米二斗半。打死五只狼以上的个人，另由政府奖给打狼英雄的荣誉，并另给重奖。集体打死十只狼以上者，亦由政府赠给打狼模范小组的荣誉，并另给重奖。组织打狼成绩卓著之各级干部，由各级政府分别予以奖励。"

    "content": "[Pingbao Frontline News] Two hundred and eighty soldiers of the Kuomintang army's New Second Army Provisional 21st Division, who were liberated in the Dingxing battle, recently held a memorial service in their garrison to vent their grievances. All vowed to join the People's Liberation Army to avenge their deceased relatives. During the memorial service, spirit tablets of twelve soldiers' parents, children, and siblings who were killed by Kuomintang bandits and local tyrants were arranged on the altar. Banners and wreaths sent by commanders and fighters of each company hung on both sides of the altar. Serial pictures illustrating Zhang Yuanguo's family's history of persecution by local tyrants were displayed, and white slogans were pasted around, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and tragedy. After the chief celebrant burned incense and made offerings before the spirits, more than thirty liberated soldiers rushed forward, vying to be the first to speak of their grievances. The atmosphere became tense. Comrade Fu Conghe was the first to speak, saying, \"I am from Sichuan, and my family has five members. Since I was a child, my family has not had a house or a piece of land. My father carried sedan chairs for others, my elder brothers picked up horse manure every day, and my mother gathered chaff and leaves. The food we ate was not as good as the landlord's dog. Because the Red Army passed through our area, the Kuomintang bandits said that my elder brother and father had connections with the Red Army and killed them. Now that I have been liberated, I deeply feel that unless we overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, the poor will never be able to turn over. I want to take revenge and join the People's Liberation Army.\" Zhou Yuqing, from Henan, recounted, \"In the past, my family rented land from Wei Zhidai, a landlord and head of the baojia system. One year, the harvest was bad, and we couldn't pay the rent. My father was beaten to death by Wei. My mother begged the villagers for a straw mat to bury my father. Later, my mother took me to beg for food, but the landlord refused to give us any, and my mother also starved to death.\" At the end of his account, he clenched his fists tightly, trembling all over, and gnashed his teeth, declaring, \"I want to join the People's Liberation Army and avenge myself against those man-eating, blood-drinking landlords, tyrants, and Chiang Kai-shek.\" Zhang Chong recounted that because he couldn't pay the rent, he was driven to a temple by the landlord. The landlord was still not satisfied and wanted to forcibly take his younger sister, forcing her to hang herself. He was already sobbing uncontrollably as he spoke. The soldiers below were all crying. Li Qingzha recounted the tragic situation of his family eating chaff after his father died of illness, wiping away his tears and resolutely stating, \"I am not sad, I want to resolutely join the army. I will go wherever the higher-ups tell me to go. After we finish fighting the enemies in North China, we will fight the enemies in South China.\" Finally, he called on everyone, saying, \"Comrades! The day of revenge has arrived. We must take up our guns and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end.\" On the spot, all the comrades were filled with grief and indignation, and actively signed up to join the army to avenge their deceased fathers. They also swore before the spirits that they would guarantee to serve the people to the end, would not desert, and would not return home until Chiang Kai-shek was completely defeated.

    "content": "[Pingbao Frontline News] In the battle to capture XuShui by the People's Liberation Army on July 20th on the Pingbao Frontline, the power of the political offensive was brought into play. Nearly 400 enemy soldiers were persuaded to lay down their arms in the city and at the train station through loudspeaker appeals. On the first day of the PLA's attack on the city, signal flares were fired into the city, and many leaflets and safety passes were distributed. The content of the leaflets, in addition to publicizing our army's victorious situation, also informed the enemy that their division commander, Chen Zhiping, had been captured in Dingxing. This pre-battle political offensive powerfully shook the enemy's determination and confidence to resist. After seeing the leaflet, the enemy regiment commander lowered his head and said nothing, and the general soldiers discussed it a lot. Some enemy regimental headquarters captains secretly changed into plain clothes after seeing the leaflets. The power of the People's Liberation Army's political offensive is based on political and military advantages. In battlefield appeals, the enemy was given a detailed explanation of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous behavior and the aggression of American imperialism. The enemy was skeptical about the People's Liberation Army's liberation of cities such as Dingxing and the capture of their division commander, Chen Zhiping. When the PLA launched its offensive and the artillery fire landed on their positions accurately and densely, they believed it and their confidence in resisting disappeared. During the battle, the PLA also closely combined military actions with appeals. Many enemies who were resisting in bunkers or hiding in dugouts surrendered their guns after being pressured by the PLA's firepower and after hearing the appeals.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 徐水战斗发挥政攻威力　争取蒋军四百放下武器\n\n1948-09-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　徐水战斗发挥政攻威力\n  　争取蒋军四百放下武器\n    【平保前线讯】七月二十日平保前线人民解放军攻克徐水战斗中，发挥了政治攻势的威力，在城内与车站，用喊话争取了近四百敌人放下武器。解放军攻城的头一天，曾向城内打进信号弹去，发出许多的传单与安全证。传单内容，除宣传我军胜利形势外，并告诉敌人的师长陈志平已在定兴被俘了，这种战前的政治攻势，有力的动摇了敌人的抵抗决心与信心。敌团长见传单后低头不语，一般士兵议论纷纷。一个敌团部上尉军官们见到传单后都回去偷偷换了便衣。解放军政治攻势的威力，是以政治上的优势与军事上的优势作基础的，在战场喊话中对敌人详尽的说明了蒋介石的卖国行为，与美帝国主义的侵略行为。敌人对解放军解放定兴等城，活捉其师长陈志平，有些人半信半疑。当解放军开始攻势，炮火落到他们阵地又多又准的时候，他们就相信了，抵抗的信心也消失了。在对战过程中，解放军同样把军事上的动作和喊话紧密的结合起来，许多正在地堡中抵抗和钻在地洞里藏躲的敌人，都是在解放军火力的压力下，经过喊话缴了枪。"

    "content": "The Korean, Indonesian, and Japanese People are Increasingly United\n　　Greek Democratic Army Wins Unprecedented Great Victory\n    The Korean people victoriously completed the election of the Supreme People's Assembly of all Korea on August 25th. This election produced 572 deputies representing all strata of the Korean people, with 360 elected from South Korea and 212 from North Korea. The newly elected Supreme People's Assembly of Korea solemnly opened in Pyongyang on September 2nd, and the People's Assembly will soon approve the Korean Constitution and elect a national democratic government. From the passage of the charter of the Korean People's Democratic Republic by the North Korean People's Assembly in April this year, to the first and second joint conferences of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea in April and June, to the creation of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, all indicate an unprecedented increase in the awareness and unity of the Korean people. In the election of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, seven million voters in South Korea (half of the total population of 14 million in South Korea) bravely participated in the election campaign, overcoming numerous difficulties and persecutions, which eloquently proves the complete failure of the U.S. imperialist enslavement policy and the extreme isolation of the South Korean reactionaries.\n    The Socialist Party, Labor Party, Indonesian Socialist Labor League, and the All-Indonesia Socialist Youth League, which participated in the Indonesian Democratic People's Front, merged into the Indonesian Communist Party in late August. This is an event of great political significance in the history of the Indonesian national liberation movement. The great development of the Indonesian Communist Party and the emergence of a new leading organ will undoubtedly strengthen the national revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.\n    Members of the Japanese Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party, along with leaders of labor unions and farmers' associations, gathered in Tokyo in late August and decided to form a new organization that could develop into a democratic national front. Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, stated that the current situation in Japan is conducive to the establishment of a broad people's front representing workers, peasants, the middle class, and even small industrialists. This people's front will fight to defend national independence, democracy, civil rights, and the economic interests of the majority of the people.\n    The Battle of Grammos, the largest since the Greek Civil War, ended on August 21 with the Democratic Army victoriously breaking through enemy lines and advancing behind enemy lines. According to the final statistics released by the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, the Democratic Army, in 70 days of heroic fighting against an enemy with ten times the manpower and fifty times the equipment, killed, wounded, and captured more than 30,000 enemy troops. This is an unprecedented and significant victory for the Democratic Army. The great significance of this victory is: first, it completely shattered the U.S.-Greek reactionaries' wishful thinking of eliminating the main force of the Democratic Army in the Grammos area, causing it to fail; second, it attracted the main force of the royalist fascist army, allowing the Democratic Army to develop in other parts of Greece, especially in Romilia, where the Democratic Army has recovered large areas occupied before this battle; third, it proved the invincible fighting will and powerful fighting strength of the Democratic Army, thereby encouraging the courage and confidence of the people of Greece in their struggle. In short, it greatly weakened the enemy and strengthened itself. Now, in the liberated areas of Greece, the Democratic Army is launching offensives everywhere; in the areas ruled by the Athens government, workers have launched waves of strikes. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party pointed out: \"After the repeated battles of Grammos, a new situation has emerged throughout Greece.\" \"The royalist fascists are now closer to their end than ever before.\"\n    Other important international events of the past week are:\n    (1) The first phase of the British imperialist war against the Malayan people – the \"forest clearing campaign\" – has failed. British imperialism has had to transfer reinforcements from various places to cope with the \"serious threats\" encountered in various regions.\n    (2) The World Congress of Cultural Workers in Defense of Peace, attended by representatives from 46 countries, was held in Poland in late August. The congress adopted a declaration in defense of peace and decided to establish an international liaison committee in Paris.\n    (3) The movement of the Yugoslav people against the Tito clique is growing. This movement has not only occurred among Yugoslav Communist Party members, Yugoslav students studying abroad, and Yugoslav diplomats abroad, but, more importantly, it is occurring within the Yugoslav army. The Tito clique's recent reorganization of the Yugoslav government and the large-scale replacement of opposition elements in various party, government, and military departments are proof of the growing anti-Tito movement.\n    (4) Due to widespread demands for wage increases, the French workers' movement has surged again. The dire consequences of economic policies and the surge in the workers' movement have forced the Mali government to step down, and Lamadier and Schumann have successively made failed cabinet experiments amidst numerous difficulties.\n    (5) To demand improved living conditions, three million Italian poor peasants and agricultural workers held a half-day national protest strike on August 21.\n    (6) Comrade Zhdanov, one of the outstanding leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and a great communist, passed away on August 31. The working people of the entire Soviet Union and the world deeply mourn him.

    "content": "The Militia of Huxi\n\nIn every county of Huxi, one can see militiamen carrying big-cap rifles, machine guns, Thompson submachine guns seized from the Chiang bandits; some militiamen even carry captured Chiang army small cannons and hold Mauser pistols. They are all emancipated peasants who, through guerrilla warfare, have become as brave and tenacious as soldiers of the regular army in protecting the masses and their own interests. One company of the 96th Brigade of the enemy's 5th Army, in coordination with two companies of local bandits, went to the eighth district of Chengwu to seize grain. Twenty militiamen in the eighth district stretched out a battle line twenty miles wide to fire their guns, confusing the enemy and holding them back for two hours, preventing the three companies of enemies from advancing. The common people took advantage of this time to hide their belongings and themselves. The large force of Chiang bandits stationed in Chengwu was constantly disturbed by the sound of gunfire from the militia every night, leaving them in a state of panic and unable to sleep. Sometimes, a single militiaman would go near the enemy's garrison to shoot, disrupting and capturing scattered bandit soldiers. Once, two large columns of enemy troops passed through Chengwu. Between each company was a Chiang soldier riding a rickshaw. A militiaman hiding in the sorghum field would rush out, knock the rickshaw over, and ride off. When the enemy army was laying telephone lines, the militiamen would follow and cut them. In the first half of this year alone, the Chengwu militia, in coordination with cadres, cut more than 500 catties of telephone wire. The militia around Kaoshan Wanggang also constantly used machine guns and small cannons to drive away or kill and wound enemies attempting to plunder. They have made many contributions and produced many heroes. Night combat is the most proficient skill of the militia in the Dandong area. They can defeat large enemy forces with a small number of armed men. The militia of Dandong × Village had only five guns after the wheat harvest. At night, they were on guard on the roofs of houses when they suddenly heard movement in the sorghum field. It turned out to be more than 300 Chiang bandits preparing to attack the village. The militiamen discovered them and shouted loudly, \"What are you doing in the sorghum field?\" The noise in the sorghum field stopped, but no one answered. The militiamen fired a shot at the place where the noise had come from. The enemy knew they had been discovered and fired machine guns and cannons at the militiamen from all directions. Six machine guns were aimed directly at the militiamen's courtyard. The brave militiamen calmly returned fire while shouting, \"First Battalion, attack from both sides! Second Battalion, Third...\" The enemy could not figure out the situation, and only fired guns without daring to advance. Soon, militiamen from other villages came to support. The militiamen shouted, \"The First Battalion is coming up from the south!\" The Chiang bandits were so frightened that they fled in panic. Another time, three militiamen from × Village were patrolling at night when they reached a ditch in front of the village. They squatted down and looked east, vaguely seeing a dark mass of people in the distance. They spread out, one to the south and one to the north. The group of people got closer and closer, and in the starlight, they could see that they were Chiang bandits coming to plunder. The three militiamen fired their guns simultaneously from three directions. The unprepared Chiang bandits turned around and ran.

    "content": "【Taihang Telegram】Huixian First District (Chengguan), after we stopped land reform, corrected policies, and launched a mass struggle to defend production and unite against the enemy, has now transformed from a no-man's land into an advancing position for fighting the enemy and has greatly strengthened the people's armed self-defense forces. The district originally had ten administrative villages that were border areas, with the furthest village being no more than eight li away from the enemy, and they were frequently attacked by the enemy. Since last June and July, due to the influence of our emphasis on mass relocation and indiscriminate struggle, coupled with the destruction by the enemy and the threat of military offensives, a large number of landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants fled to enemy-controlled areas. Of the more than 9,000 people in the ten border villages, more than 4,600 fled. The most serious case was in Jiushengying, where 1,200 out of 1,900 people fled, leaving only women and the elderly at home. As a result, there were more than one hundred hectares of wasteland in the entire district, and the struggle against the enemy was left to only a few militiamen who dared not stay in the villages, returning early every morning and leaving late every night. After studying this situation, our leadership stopped land reform in the area last autumn, focusing on production and combining it with policy propaganda to win back the border area masses. At that time, the biggest difficulty for the masses in the border areas was that there was no one to weed the seedlings, and they could not plant wheat on the wasteland. We seized on this demand from the masses and immediately launched two production support efforts to the border areas, mobilizing 2,000 laborers and 105 head of livestock, including 25 head from the enemy-occupied areas. They all brought their own food, and district and village cadres personally led them to the fields, combining it with propaganda. Soon, all the seedlings were weeded, and most of the wheat was planted. This greatly moved the masses in the border areas, and the fleeing households returned one after another. Nearly 600 people returned to Jiushengying village alone. About 4,000 people returned to the entire district. The morale of the masses began to stabilize, and the village militia self-defense teams also began to develop, organizing \"dare-to-die\" squads for the struggle against the enemy, presenting a new atmosphere. This spring, after the reorganization of cadres, we further carried out policy propaganda, resettled the fleeing households, and made extensive efforts to win them over through various relationships. Now, eight out of ten fleeing households in the entire district have returned home to engage in production. From then on, the no-man's land was eliminated. After most of the fleeing households returned, the leadership explained and rectified policies, resettling the fleeing households one after another, enabling them to quickly obtain land for cultivation, and especially promoted the policy of \"whoever cultivates it, owns the harvest.\" Under this influence, the worries of landlords, rich peasants, and some middle peasants who were afraid of struggle and unable to focus on production were dispelled. In ×× village, after more than 90 poor peasant households distributed the land from two evil landlord households and the public land, they quickly turned to production. Four landlord and rich peasant households, including three rich peasants occupying 156 mu of land, also participated in thirteen mutual aid teams. The rich peasants also actively stood guard and patrolled, using \"dare-to-die\" spears to attack the enemy. The mood of unity against the enemy among all classes rose even higher. In terms of production, this year a total of more than 5,000 mu of wasteland were eliminated in the ten villages, and six villages increased their livestock by 90 head. Many poor peasants who did well in production also bought new livestock. Sixteen poor peasant households in ×× village have increased their livestock by sixteen head.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 辉县一区正确掌握边地政策　保卫生产团结对敌\n\n1948-09-12\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　辉县一区正确掌握边地政策\n  　保卫生产团结对敌\n    【太行电】辉县一区（城关），在我停止土改，端正政策，发动了以保卫生产团结对敌的群众性斗争后，现已由无人区变为对敌斗争的前进阵地。并大大增强了人民武装自卫的力量。该区原有十个行政村是边沿区，离敌最远的村不过八里，时遭敌人袭击。去年六、七月来，由于我强调群众大转移和乱斗乱杀的影响，更加上敌人的摧残及军事进攻的威胁，大批地富以及中贫农逃往敌区，边沿十个村九千多人口即跑了四千六百多人。其中最严重的如九圣营，全村一千九百口跑了一千二百口，留在家里的只剩妇女老弱。因此全区荒地百顷以上，对敌斗争只剩少数民兵，每天晚出早归，不敢在村坚持。我领导上研究了这个情况后，于去秋便停止了当地的土改，以生产为中心结合宣传政策，争取边地群众归来。当时边沿区群众的最大困难是苗荒没人锄，荒地种不上麦子。我抓住群众这个要求，当即发动了我区和敌占区群众两次对边地的生产支援，动员了二千劳力，一百零五犋牲口，其中有敌占区群众二十五犋，支援时都是自带干粮，区村干部亲自率领上地，并结合进行宣传，很快即将荒苗全部锄完，麦子也大部种下。这一来大大的感动了边地群众，逃亡户陆续回来，九圣营一村即回来近六百人。全区回来四千人左右。群众情绪开始稳定，各村民兵自卫队也开始发展，自卫队组织起决把枪班对敌斗争，现出新的气象。今春经过干部整编，又进一步的开展政策宣传，安置逃亡户，利用各种关系大量放手进行争取。现全区十分之八的逃亡户已返家进行生产。从此无人区便消灭了。在大部逃亡户回来后，领导上又进行讲解政策，端正政策，陆续安置逃亡户，使他们迅速得到土地耕种，并特别宣传了谁种谁收的政策，在此影响下解除了地富以及一部中农怕斗争不安心生产的顾虑。××村全村九十多户贫农，在分配了二户恶霸地主和公社分地后，便很快转向了生产。四户地富其中三户富农占土地一五六亩，也分别参加了十三个互助班，富农也积极站岗放哨，拿决把枪打击敌人，各阶层一致团结对敌斗争的情绪由此更加高涨起来。生产方面，在十个村内今年共消灭荒地五千余亩，六个村增加牲口九十头。不少贫农生产搞的好，也新买了牲口。××村十六户贫农已增加牲口十六头。"

At the Northeast Workers' Representative Congress on the 14th of last month, Guo Linjun, a representative from Harbin, reported on the regulations for the production merit campaign in state-owned enterprises in the Northeast Liberated Area. Based on the experience of the production merit campaign in Harbin and other areas of the Northeast Liberated Area, he elaborated on several issues concerning production merit.\n\nHe said: Regular ideological education and ideological preparation before the start of the campaign are the political foundation of the merit campaign. The purpose of ideological preparation is to get through the thinking from the leadership to the masses, overcome incorrect views on production merit, and establish clear goals and understanding. The specific method is to adopt various forms of meetings, lectures, and discussions, going deep from point to surface to mobilize the masses ideologically. Regarding the issue of formulating production merit plans, he said: The formulation of production merit plans should be based on the administrative production tasks of the enterprise, which is a guarantee for completing or exceeding the administrative production tasks. When making plans, it is first necessary to grasp production standards, which is a basic link in making plans, because the level of production standards will affect the smooth development of the merit campaign. In order to grasp the standards, leading cadres must delve into the business, study technology, and understand the situation. When making plans, the leadership should grasp the key points of the enterprise departments, find typical examples, and personally lead the work. Regarding the organization and leadership of the merit campaign, he put forward several issues that should be paid attention to in the leadership: First, pay attention to the fact that the production merit campaign should take improving production quantity and quality as the starting point; second, the merit campaign is a broad mass movement, and should make \"everyone can achieve merit, everything can achieve merit.\" Whether workers and staff, technical and non-technical personnel, leading cadres and the masses, masters and apprentices, those who have special performance in any work can achieve merit, and pay attention to the fact that employees with regular work also have the opportunity to achieve merit, so as not to become a trophy movement for only a few people; third, establish various systems, such as reporting and commendation system, inspection system, merit evaluation and merit list system, reward system, etc.; fourth, pay attention to avoid overusing the enthusiasm of the masses, protect the health of employees, and avoid engaging in temporary sprints and desperation, while paying attention to transforming lazy people in the production merit; fifth, the leadership should pay attention to grasping materials, not burying real achievements, and further studying production standards to gradually improve production standards; sixth, regularly summarize experience, enrich the content of the merit campaign, and improve the movement.\n\nFinally, Guo Linjun also explained the general spirit of the merit campaign, the standards and types of heroes, what are the standards for production merit, the merit evaluation organization, the merit evaluation method, the merit evaluation principles, the commendation and reward of merit, and the emergence of labor heroes in production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 郭林军在东北职代大会报告　企业生产立功运动条例\n\n1948-09-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　郭林军在东北职代大会报告\n  　企业生产立功运动条例\n    【新华社东北九日电】上月十四日东北职工代表大会中由哈市代表郭林军报告东北解放区公营企业中生产立功运动条例。他根据哈尔滨市及东北解放区其他地区生产立功运动的经验，阐述了关于生产立功中的几个问题。\n    他说：平时的思想教育与运动开始的思想酝酿，是立功运动的政治基础。而思想酝酿的目的，是要从领导上到群众打通思想，克服对生产立功的不正确看法，树立明确的目的和认识。其具体办法是采取各种形式的会议，讲解、讨论，从点到面的深入下去，使群众在思想上动员起来。关于制订生产立功计划问题，他说：制定生产立功计划要根据企业行政生产任务来进行，这是完成或超过行政生产任务的保证。在订计划时首先要掌握生产标准，这是订计划的基本环节，因生产标准的高低会影响立功运动的顺利开展。为了掌握标准，领导干部要深入业务，研究技术，了解情况。在订计划时，领导上要掌握企业部门的重点，找典型，亲自动手领导去作。关于立功运动的组织领导，他提出了在领导上应该注意的几个问题：一、注意生产立功运动，应以提高生产数量与质量为出发点；二、立功运动是广泛的群众性的运动，应使“人人能立功，事事能立功”，不论工人与职员，技术与非技术者，领导干部与群众，师傅与徒弟，在任何工作上有特殊表现者都可立功，并注意有经常性工作的职工，亦有立功的机会，这样才不致成为单只少数人的锦标运动；三、建立各种制度，如汇报与表扬制度，检查制度，评功加功劳榜制度，奖励制度等；四、在生产立功中注意不要过度使用群众的积极性，保护职工健康，避免只从事一时的突击和拼命主义，同时注意改造懒汉；五、领导上注意掌握材料，不埋没真实功劳，进一步研究生产标准，达到逐渐提高生产标准；六、经常总结经验，充实立功运动的内容，使运动提高一步。\n    最后郭林军将立功运动的总精神，功臣标准与种类，生产立功有什么标准，评功组织，评功方式，评功原则，功劳之表扬与奖励及生产中的劳动英雄的产生等问题，亦作了解释和说明。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-12",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 9th: Chen Yu, head of the Northeast Industrial Department delegation, introduced the draft of the \"Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations\" at the National Labor Congress on the 16th. He pointed out that the labor insurance regulations to be adopted by this congress and proposed to the government are a historically significant document in the Chinese workers' movement. The past five labor congresses have focused on how to struggle against capitalists to win labor insurance benefits; while now, the workers in the liberated areas are studying how to strive to develop production, support the front lines, and establish a rational wartime labor insurance system under the people's regime. He said: In capitalist countries, the labor insurance fund is borne by the workers themselves, and capitalists contribute only a very small portion at most; while in the laws of colonial countries, there is basically no provision for labor insurance, and workers' demands for labor insurance are illegal, and the struggle of workers to win labor insurance will be subject to armed suppression by reactionary rule. In the past 20 years, the Chinese working class has written many heroic struggles in the struggle to win labor insurance benefits. During the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, many victories were won in labor insurance, but they were limited to individual enterprises and industries, and had not yet been clearly stipulated by the state in law. Moreover, after the failure of the Great Revolution, the Kuomintang cancelled or reduced labor insurance benefits in individual enterprises and industries.\n\n　　In contrast to this situation, although the New Democratic government in the liberated areas did not have written legislation on labor insurance in the past, the employees of public factories enjoyed labor insurance benefits. The government is firmly implementing the policy of protecting the interests of workers, especially paying more attention to chemical industry workers, miners, and munitions workers whose physical health is endangered. Appropriate treatment measures are in place for those injured or killed on duty, as well as for sickness, pensions, and maternity allowances for female workers. After this Labor Congress formulates the labor insurance regulations, the labor insurance undertakings in various parts of Northeast China can be unified, forming a system, and can be used as a reference for other liberated areas.\n\n　　Chen Yu then gave a brief explanation of the Northeast Public Enterprise Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations. The draft is divided into: Chapter 1 General Provisions; Chapter 2 Regulations on the Collection and Custody of Labor Insurance Funds; Chapter 3 Various Labor Insurance Undertakings to be Conducted; Chapter 4 Regulations on the Method of Distributing Labor Insurance Funds; Chapter 5 Supervision and Review of Labor Insurance Funds; Chapter 6 Supplementary Provisions. The full text contains 28 articles. Chen Yu pointed out that many of the methods stipulated in the regulations have not yet been achieved in capitalist countries. For example, the standard for the collection of labor insurance funds stipulates that the enterprise contributes 3% of the total wage as the labor insurance fund, and the employees contribute 0.5% of the wage as the labor insurance fund, which shows that the government mainly bears the burden, and the employees only bear a very small part; and the amount borne by the government, if the medical treatment and the wages paid during the injury and illness are included, is about 10% of the total wage, which is quite high as wartime labor insurance. The labor insurance funds of capitalist countries are mainly borne by the workers, who are deducted from their wages. For example, for the living allowance for elderly workers, it is stipulated that elderly employees who are 60 years old and have worked for more than 25 years can enjoy the living allowance. The calculation of seniority is not limited to the enterprise or the national area, so the working time during the puppet Manchukuo period can also be included in the seniority. In capitalist countries, most regulations stipulate that workers can enjoy the benefits at the age of 65 or 50, with 30 to 40 years of service, and are limited to the enterprise and the country. For example, the Kuomintang Beining Railway has only a history of more than 50 years, but the Kuomintang stipulates that only those with 40 years of service can enjoy pensions, and the eight years of service during the Anti-Japanese War are not counted. In fact, the pension benefits are clearly cancelled. For example, the regulations on compensation stipulate that all medical expenses for those injured on duty are borne by the enterprise, and the full wages are paid for the treatment period, limited to six months, which also exceeds the regulations of many capitalist countries.\n\n　　Chen Yu concluded by pointing out that labor insurance is a long-term plan to improve workers' lives and increase production, so it is inseparable from the production system. To truly do a good job in insurance, it is not only a matter of increasing labor insurance funds or improving living conditions, but more importantly, actively adopting new technical conditions, increasing new production equipment, so as to avoid accidents in the production process, reduce the physical and mental consumption of workers, and reduce disease and death. In capitalist countries, the bourgeoisie simply pursues profits and takes a indifferent attitude towards the health and life of workers, and it is impossible to have special equipment to protect the health and safety of workers. Socialist Soviet Union is the most advanced banner of labor insurance in the world. There, employees do not need to pay insurance premiums, which are entirely borne by the enterprise. They are more actively committed to improving machinery and equipment and production technology, so that workers can get safer protection in labor and reduce the occurrence of accidents. The New Democratic Chinese Liberated Areas cannot be immune to many restrictions when running labor insurance undertakings during the war, but these difficulties can be gradually overcome with the victory of the war. He said enthusiastically: \"The Soviet Union has made great strides in economic construction and rapid progress in employee labor insurance undertakings due to the strength of the people. I believe that the current liberated areas, as well as the labor insurance undertakings of the liberated China in the future, will certainly be able to make rapid progress.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陈郁在全国劳大介绍：东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例\n\n1948-09-12\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陈郁在全国劳大介绍：\n    东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例\n    【新华社东北九日电】东北工业部代表团团长陈郁十六日在全国劳动大会介绍“东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例”草案。他指出此次大会行将通过准备向政府提议的劳动保险条例，是中国职工运动中有历史意义的文献。过去五次劳动大会都是研究如何向资本家作斗争以争取劳动保险利益；而现在解放区的职工是研究在人民政权下，如何努力发展生产，支援前线，并建立合理的战时劳动保险制度了。他说：在资本主义国家劳动保险基金是由工人自己负担，资本家最多也不过是拿出极少一部分；而在殖民地国家的法律里，基本上是没有劳动保险这一条的，工人要求劳动保险是违法的，工人为争取劳动保险的斗争是要遭受反动统治的武装镇压的。中国工人阶级二十余年来在争取劳动保险利益的斗争中，曾写下了许多英勇斗争的史篇。一九二五至一九二七年的大革命时代中，曾在劳动保险上获得了不少胜利，但只限于在个别企业和产业，还没有得到国家在法律上明文规定。而且在大革命失败后，国民党又把个别企业与产业中的劳动保险待遇取消了或降低了。\n    与这种情形相反，解放区新民主主义政府过去虽然没有劳动保险的成文立法，但公营工厂的职工，都有劳动保险的待遇。政府是坚决执行保护工人利益政策的，特别是对工人身体健康有危害的化学工业工人、矿工、军火工人等更加注意。对因公受伤或因公死亡的，以及疾病、养老金和女工生育补助金等都有适当待遇办法。这次劳动大会制订出劳动保险条例后，东北各地的劳动保险事业便可趋于统一，形成制度，并可供其他解放区参考。\n    陈郁继对东北公营企业战时暂行劳动保险条例，作简略解释。该草案计分：第一章概则；第二章关于劳动保险基金之征集与保管方法规定；第三章应举办之各项劳动保险事业；第四章关于劳动保险基金支配方法之规定；第五章劳动保险基金之监督与审查；第六章附则。全文共二十八条。陈郁指出该条例中所规定之办法，有许多是资本主义国家至今还没有办到的。如在劳动保险金之征集标准中规定由企业方面缴纳等于全部工资的百分之三为劳动保险基金，职工则缴纳工资千分之五的劳动保险金，这说明了主要是由政府负担，职工仅负担极小部分；而政府负担之数量，如将医药治疗及伤病时所付的工资等均计算在内，则约及全部工资百分之十左右，这个数目作为战时劳动保险是相当高的。而资本主义国家的劳动保险基金，主要是由工人担负，从工资中扣收。又如对于老年工人生活补助金，规定老年职工年满六十岁，工龄在二十五年以上者，即可享生活补助金之待遇。工龄之计算并不限定必须在本企业或本国区域之内，因而在伪满时期作工时间，亦得算入工龄之内。而资本主义国家，大都规定在六十五或五十岁，工龄三十年至四十年方可享受，且限制于本企业和本国。如国民党北宁铁路仅有五十余年的历史，而国民党却规定工龄四十年者方得享有养老金，且抗战八年间的工龄又不得计算在内，实际上是明白取消养老金的待遇。再如对于恤金规定因公负伤者之全部医疗费由企业方面负担，并付给治疗期之全部工资，以六个月为限，这也是超过许多资本主义国家规定的。\n    陈郁在结语中提出：劳动保险，是改善工人生活，为增加生产作长期打算，因此也是同生产制度分不开的。要真正做好保险事业，就不仅是增加劳动保险基金或改善生活条件，更重要的是积极采取新的技术条件，增加新的生产设备，以避免生产过程中发生事故，减少工人体力脑力的消耗，减少疾病和死亡。资本主义国家，资产阶级单纯追逐利润，对工人健康生命采取漠视态度，不可能为保障工人健康安全而有特殊设备。社会主义的苏联，则是全世界劳动保险事业最先进的旗帜。在那里职工不用缴纳保险费，完全由企业方面负担，他们更积极致力于机器设备和生产技术的改进，使工人在劳动中得到更安全的保障，减少意外事故的发生。新民主主义的中国解放区，在战争时期举办劳动保险事业，不能不受很多限制，但这些困难随着战争的胜利进展是可以逐渐克服的。他热忱地说：“苏联是由人民的力量使经济建设大踏步前进，职工劳动保险事业突飞猛进。相信现在的解放区，以及将来解放了的全中国的劳动保险事业也一定能够很快的进步。”"

    "content": "[Jinan News] Shangmatou District in the Second District of Yuanchao is actively arranging for the autumn harvest and wheat planting, implementing a plan of achieving a bumper harvest, delivering manure while harvesting, plowing while delivering, and preparing for timely planting. In Sanniangniangmiao Village, two-thirds of the manure dug out of the manure pits has already been delivered to the fields. Wang Dianzhong immediately started plowing the stubble after harvesting the sorghum, and then carried manure to the fields. Zhang Peixing's wife participated in harvesting sorghum, while her husband pushed the manure cart and she pulled it, and the manure has now been completely delivered. Currently, the village has plowed 54 mu of early-stubble land from sorghum, millet, etc., and the entire village plans to plant wheat on 65% of its land (the village is not entirely good land). The masses in Shangmatou Village are vying to use carts to deliver manure. Due to a shortage of carts, they have switched to using livestock for two *xiang* at a time. In order to plant more wheat, Qi Yuhai specially bought 100,000 yuan worth of manure from Daming. The village also convened mass meetings by area to discuss and study the wheat planting plan. Zhengzhai Village has now plowed more than 20 mu of early-stubble land. Many women, such as Liu Jinchao's wife, are participating in agricultural labor, helping their husbands chop sorghum, and taking time to cut grass to free up male labor for more intensive work. Huang Jiusi is cutting and plowing the stubble on his three *mu* of millet as he harvests, delivering manure, and then plowing it. In Xinzhuang Village, sorghum is harvested as it ripens. Currently, all villages in the district are generally making wheat planting plans, and planning to apply two to three large cartloads of manure per *mu*, harvesting, applying manure, and plowing in succession, planting according to the season. Every night, the village loudspeakers praise model workers and disseminate experiences, and the masses in each village have very high production enthusiasm.

    "content": "Jiluyu Electricity: The Direct Hospital of the Military Region's Health Department, since the rectification of the Party and the military, has shown even greater enthusiasm for serving the wounded and sick, launching a surge of blood type testing and blood transfusion. More than 230 staff members from the First, Second, Third Departments and the hospital headquarters are all preparing for blood transfusions. Comrade Li Yucheng, a squad leader from the × regiment of the Sixth Military Sub-district, was in a coma due to excessive bleeding from an arterial injury in his thigh. Director Wang extracted 40 cc of his own blood, and Doctor Liu Zhuting also extracted 60 cc of his own fresh blood and injected it into Comrade Li's artery. Later, when Comrade Li recovered his health and learned that the director and doctor had personally transfused blood for him, he was so happy that he couldn't speak, and with tears in his eyes, he said, \"When I'm fully recovered, I'll definitely make Chiang Kai-shek pay for my blood. How can I be worthy of the director saving my life if I don't demand blood from Chiang Kai-shek?\" After Doctor Liu donated blood, he continued to participate in surgeries for two consecutive days, working tirelessly. Comrade Zhu Ziyu, the deputy political instructor of the First Company of the First Regiment of the Independent Brigade in the First Department, was wounded in the waist. Due to excessive blood loss and the bullet remaining lodged in his waist, his temperature was consistently between 39 and 40 degrees Celsius, and more than 100 cc of pus was discharged daily. Various medications proved ineffective, and he gradually became emaciated and unable to eat, relying solely on nutrient enemas to maintain his strength. After the first 60 cc blood transfusion, his spirit improved, and he could eat half a bowl of milk, and his temperature also decreased. After the second 60 cc blood transfusion, his temperature dropped to normal, and he was able to eat soft food. Zhang Desheng from the Second Department requested to donate 300 cc of blood to the wounded and sick, and female comrade Zhang Hong requested to donate 500 cc of blood to the wounded and sick. Comrades Zhang Desheng, Li Yan, and others have already donated once and are preparing to donate again, and these comrades have persisted in their work after donating blood, without taking a break.\n    (Blood transfusions for the wounded should be encouraged, but the health of the blood donors must also be taken into account to avoid affecting their work—Editor)\n\n    Taihang Electricity: Since launching the \"Strive for Merit\" campaign last year, the First and Second Health Stations of the Fourth Military Sub-district have achieved remarkable results in medical work, and the class consciousness and new treatment techniques of all comrades have improved. Under the slogan \"Be a Good Hired Hand for the Wounded,\" the First Station has eliminated the phenomenon of wounded soldiers becoming disabled or sacrificing their lives for no reason. Stubborn injuries and illnesses are quickly cured and discharged after careful surgery by doctors. In the past six months, those cured and discharged accounted for 76 percent of the total, including more than 50 cases of stubborn injuries. Those who sacrificed accounted for 4 percent, and those currently in the hospital accounted for 20 percent. The Second Station put forward the slogan \"Blitz Treatment, Early Discharge.\" Under the leadership of Director Zhang Dianbin, they treated patients day and night, and the wounded and sick discharged in one and a half months accounted for 47 percent of the total, creating an unprecedented treatment record for the station. Political work has played a guaranteeing role in medical work. In addition to classes, the First Station, from the director to the medical staff, frequently visited the wounded soldiers' rooms to offer comfort and solicit opinions. The Second Station also established a club, a family reception committee, and reading and study groups.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫军区直属医院　热烈为伤员输血\n\n1948-09-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫军区直属医院\n  　热烈为伤员输血\n    【冀鲁豫电】军区卫生部直属医院，自整党整军后，为伤病员服务的热忱更高，发动了检查血型和输血热潮。一、二、三所及院部二百三十多个工作人员，都作输血的准备。六分区×团班长李玉成同志，因股部动脉受伤，出血过多，昏迷不醒。王院长就把自己的血取出了四十西西，医生刘竹庭同志也取出了自己的六十西西鲜血，注入李班长的动脉。后来当李班长恢复了健康，知道院长医生亲自给他输血，高兴的说不出话来，眼泪汪汪的说：“等我全好了后，一定叫蒋介石赔我的血，不和蒋介石要血怎对得起院长救我一命呢？”刘医生输了血后，一连两天还是忙着参加动手术，毫不疲倦的工作着。在一所独一旅一团一连副政指朱子玉同志，腰部负伤，因流血过多，子弹在腰中又没有出来，热度经常在三十九度与四十度，每天流脓在一百西西以上，经各种药物治疗都不见效，身渐消瘦不能吃饭，只以营养灌肠维持体力。经第一次六十西西的输血后，精神就见好转，能吃半碗牛奶，体温也下降了。又经第二次六十西西输血后，体温下降和平常时一样，能吃软饭了。在二所张德胜要求给伤病员三百西西血，女同志张虹要求给伤病员五百西西血。张德胜、李延等同志已抽了一次，还准备再抽，并且这些同志抽了血后，都坚持工作，不休息。\n    （为伤员输血应提倡，但被抽血的同志的健康亦须注意，以免影响工作——编者）\n    【太行电】四分区一、二两卫生所自去年开展立功运动以来，医疗工作获显著成绩，全体同志阶级觉悟及新治疗法技术均有提高。一所在“为伤员当个好长工”的口号下，消灭了伤员无故残废、无故牺牲的现象，顽固的伤病，经过医生慎重施手术，很快就治好出院。半年来治好出院的占全数百分之七十六，其中治好顽固伤五十多人。牺牲的占百分之四，现留院的占百分之二十。二所提出了“突击治疗提前出院”的口号，在所长张殿彬同志带头下，昼夜治疗，一个半月治好出院的伤病员即占总数百分之四十七，创造了该所空前的治疗纪录。政治工作对医疗工作起了保证作用。一所，除上课外，从所长到医杂人员，经常到伤员房慰问，征求意见，二所并建立了俱乐部，家属招待委员会，读报与学习小组。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-13",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Beiyue Administrative Office Issues Detailed Instructions\n\tOrganize Labor to Complete the Three Autumn Harvests\n\n【Beiyue Electric】The Beiyue Administrative Office issued instructions on August 31 regarding autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and autumn plowing. The original text is as follows:\n\t(1) Autumn Harvesting: Autumn harvesting work should propose different tasks for different regions. To consolidate, the first priority is timely harvesting, reaping as soon as crops are ripe, to avoid losses from windstorms and autumn rains. In border areas and guerrilla zones, labor must be combined with military preparedness, remaining vigilant against enemy plots to seize grain. Local military units, work teams, and militias should proactively launch attacks to protect the autumn harvest. Party and government leading organs must seize the initiative to organize peasants to rush harvesting, rush reaping, quick threshing, and quick storage, and strengthen anti-smuggling efforts to prevent the enemy from forcibly requisitioning, buying, or stealing a single grain of food.\n\tRegardless of whether it is a consolidated area or a guerrilla zone, selecting seeds in the field should be an important task for this year's autumn harvest. In recent years, crop varieties have been mixed and of poor quality, and diseases are very serious. In many places, millet production has decreased by as much as 15% due to \"exposed cores\" or \"old-looking grains.\" Corn, sorghum, and millet have experienced yield reductions of 10% to 20% due to head smut. Field selection of seeds is one of the basic methods to reduce crop infectious diseases and achieve increased grain production. All localities must conscientiously study and widely publicize the seed selection methods published in the Chahar Daily on August 27, and specifically convene symposiums of industry assistant, industry committee members, and experienced farmers to arrange, implement, supervise, and inspect, make concrete achievements, lay the foundation for seed selection, and gradually change the backward habits of farmers not selecting seeds or selecting them in the field. The selected seeds should be dried and placed in a dry, cool place, not hung under the eaves to avoid wind, rain, sun, and smoke.\n\t\tOrganize Field Seed Selection \tPrepare Sufficient Fertilizer\n\tTo protect the fruits of the peasants' labor for the year, all localities should establish field watching organizations, formulate autumn protection covenants, and strictly prevent sabotage by thieves and vandals. Special attention should be paid to Chahar South and Yanbei.\n\t(2) Wheat Planting: This year's abundant rain is good for wheat planting. Wheat should be planted as much as possible in suitable watered land and good dry land. However, wheat should not be forced to be planted in bad land that is not suitable for wheat planting or where wheat yields will be reduced due to thin soil, or in dry land where sowing cannot be done in a timely manner after summer drought. This year's focus for guiding wheat planting is:\n\tFirst, vigorously solve the fertilizer problem: The lack of fertilizer for wheat planting last year is an important reason for the reduced wheat yield this year. When planting wheat this autumn, it is required to apply more base fertilizer and fully fertilize. All kinds of fertilizer that can be delivered to the field should be used for wheat fields first. (Fertilizer for next spring sowing can be quickly prepared during the slack season by continuing to accumulate fertilizer, build reservoirs, and release silt to prepare early.) If it is still insufficient, it should be advocated to use black beans, hemp seeds, and other supplements. Attention should be paid to helping the military, workers, families of martyrs, and poor households solve their fertilizer shortage difficulties through mutual aid and agricultural loans. Poor farmers who really need and are willing to apply base fertilizer but lack fertilizer for planting wheat can be given special fertilizer loans.\n\tSecond, in order to effectively prevent bunt disease, this year efforts should be made to promote the warm water soaking method of \"two openings and one cooling\" or the method of mixing one jin of seeds with seven qian of Chinese dates wine (grain wine can be slightly less), as well as methods of using fine sieves, salt water, muddy water, and windmills to eliminate wheat weeds (bunt spores) (see the \"Prevention and Control of Diseases and Pests\" booklet issued by the Border Government Agricultural and Forestry Department). These methods are simple, easy to implement, and very effective. Cadres at all levels leading production must master this technology, convene meetings, make special arrangements, personally demonstrate typical examples, to promote the entire village, district, and county to make concrete achievements. All agricultural extension stations and extension workers must select areas and personally teach technology to promote implementation.\n\t\tAll Autumn Land Ploughed \tFallow Land Can Eliminate Insects\n\t(3) Autumn Plowing: Autumn plowing is a fundamental method to eliminate insect pests. It is not only simple and easy to implement, but also has the greatest effect. Universally implementing one autumn plowing can eliminate at least half of the insect disasters. This year requires early plowing and deep plowing. All land that can be ploughed should strive to avoid leaving unploughed land. Early plowing can allow the land to rest early, get more sun, and be strong next year; deep plowing can restore the land that has been cultivated shallowly year by year to its original depth, deepening it by three or four tenths of an inch to four or five tenths of an inch each year. After several months of sun and weathering, raw soil can be transformed into cultivated soil. Yanbei, Chahar South, and areas with climates unsuitable for wheat planting should concentrate their efforts to lead a campaign for autumn plowing, to correct the crude cultivation methods of planting on unploughed land in previous years and lay the foundation for improving agricultural production by one inch next year. In places where rice stem borers have occurred, rice stubble should be picked up and burned in conjunction with autumn plowing to completely eliminate stem borers. In autumn plowing, in addition to mobilizing the masses to purchase livestock themselves, providing loan support, and organizing human and animal labor exchange; attention should also be paid to the quantity of livestock in different regions, the busy and slack seasons, and, based on the principle of equal value and willingness, calling on the masses with surplus livestock power to sell yokes and sell labor (no coercion or interference is allowed for any reason) to regulate the shortage of livestock power.\n\t(4) Organizing all labor is the central link to complete the autumn harvest, wheat planting, and autumn plowing. Based on the principle of voluntary and equal value, good organization of mutual labor assistance should be done, and family participation should be vigorously promoted. This is a good method to mobilize women and children to participate in production and solve the shortage of labor. For military, worker, martyr families, and families of conscripted laborers who lack labor, the greatest attention must be paid to earnestly organizing substitute harvesting and plowing to help them solve their difficulties. Party, government, people's rear-service organs, and troops, schools, and civilian laborers supporting the front should all take out possible time to help the masses locally. The first priority is to help military, worker, martyr families, and families of conscripted laborers who lack labor.\n\tLeading organs at all levels should pay attention to resolving the contradiction between autumn harvesting, wheat planting, autumn plowing and other work. During this period, with the exception of necessary war mobilization, all work must be centered on production and carried out in conjunction. Sufficient time should be allowed for production work to ensure that agricultural timing is not missed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳行署发出详细指示　组织劳力完成三秋\n\n1948-09-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳行署发出详细指示\n  　组织劳力完成三秋\n    【北岳电】北岳行政公署于八月三十一日发出关于秋收、种麦、秋耕工作的指示。原文如下：  　（一）秋收工作：秋收工作要按不同地区提出不同任务。巩固其首先要做到收割及时，熟一片收一片，做到不遭风灾和秋雨损失；在边沿区和游击区必须实行劳武结合，百倍警惕敌人的抢粮阴谋。各地方兵团、武工队及民兵，要主动出击掩护秋收。党政领导机关要抓紧组织农民抢收、抢割、快打、快藏，并加强缉私，不使敌人强征、强买、抢走一粒粮食。\n    不论巩固区或游击区，都要将田间选种作为今年秋收的重要任务。几年来作物品种杂劣，病害十分严重。不少地方谷子因有“露心”或“看谷老”，致减产已达百分之十五。玉茭、高粱、黍稷等，因黑疸致减收百分之十至二十。田间选种是减少作物传染病害，达到粮食增产基本方法之一。各地要切实研究广泛宣传察哈尔日报八月二十七日所载选种方法，并专门召开实业助理员、实业委员以及老农座谈会，布置执行督促检查，做出具体成绩，打下选种的基础，逐渐改变农民不选种或在场里选的落后习惯。所选种子要晒干，放在干燥凉爽的地方，不要挂在房檐下，以免风吹、雨打、日晒、烟薰。\n    　　　　组织田间选种　准备充足肥料\n    为保护农民一年的劳动成果，各地应建立看田组织，制定护秋公约，严防破坏分子偷盗破坏。察南、雁北尤应格外注意。\n    （二）种麦工作：今年雨多好种麦。适宜种麦的水地和好旱地，应该尽量多种；但土壤不宜种麦，或因地瘦种麦反而减产的坏地，或因夏旱麦后不能及时播种的旱地，不应勉强多种。今年领导种麦的重点：\n    一、大力解决肥料问题：去年种麦肥料不足，是今年麦子减产的重要原因。今秋种麦时，要求多下垫本，充分施肥，凡能送到地里的各种肥料，都要先尽麦田使用；（明年春播的肥料，可抓紧农闲继续压肥、积肥、修渠放淤，早作准备。）如仍感不足，应提倡使用黑豆麻糁等辅助。对军、工、烈属和贫苦户的缺肥困难，应注意以互助和农贷帮助其解决。确有需要，又肯下垫本的贫苦农家，种麦缺乏肥料，可以专作肥料贷款。\n    二、为了有效地防除黑穗病，今年要努力推行两开封一凉的温水浸种，或一斤种子七钱元花枣酒（粮食酒可略少）的拌种方法，以及细筛、盐水、泥水、风车等淘汰麦莠子（王母瘤）的方法（详见边府农林处印发之防除病虫害小册子），这些办法简单易行，效力很好。各级领导生产的干部，都须掌握这个技术，并召开会议，专作布置，亲自下手典型示范，以推动全村、全区、全县作出具体成绩。各农场推广场推广员，均须选定地区，亲自动手传授技术，推动进行。\n    　　　　秋地全部耕过　歇地又能灭虫\n    （三）、秋耕地：秋耕地是消灭虫害的治本方法。不但简单易行，而且效果最大，普遍实行一次秋耕，虫灾至少可以免除一半。今年要求早耕深耕，凡能耕过的地，争取不留白茬地。早耕可以使地早得休息，多晒太阳，明年力壮；深耕可将逐年耕浅的土地恢复到原有的深度，每年加深三四分至四五分，经过几个月的日晒风化，生土可以变成熟土。雁北、察南及气候不宜种麦的地区，更应集中力量，领导突击秋耕，以改正历年种白茬地的粗劣耕作方法，打下明年农业生产提高一寸的基础。在发生过谷钻心虫的地方，要结合秋耕拾去谷茬烧掉，以求彻底消灭钻心虫。秋耕地中，除发动群众自购牲畜，贷款扶助，组织人畜变工外；还应注意不同地区牲口多寡，季节忙闲，在等价自愿的原则下，号召群众有剩余畜力者卖犋、卖工（不得以任何理由加以勉强或干涉），以调剂畜力之不足。\n    （四）组织全部劳动力是完成收秋、种麦、秋耕工作的中心环节。应该根据自愿等价的原则，很好的组织拨工互助，并大力提倡全家下手。这是发动妇女儿童参加生产，解决劳力不足的良好方法。对于缺乏劳动力的军、工、烈属及出征民工家属，更要以最大的注意，切实组织代收、代耕，帮助他们解决困难。各级党、政、民后方机关及部队、学校、支前民工，均须抽出可能的时间，就地帮助群众。首先是帮助缺乏劳力的军、工、烈属，出征民工家属。\n    各级领导机关要注意解决秋收种麦秋耕工作与其他工作的矛盾。在此期间，除必要的战争动员外，一切工作均须以生产为中心，结合进行。要给生产工作留出充裕的时间，保证做到不误农时。"

    "content": "Agricultural Production in North China in August\n    ——Overcoming Disasters, Protecting Autumn Crops, Preparing for Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting\n    [Report from this newspaper] Overcoming disasters, protecting autumn seedlings, and preparing for the autumn harvest and wheat planting are the central themes of agricultural production in the North China Liberated Area in August, and great achievements have been made in various places. The entire region has suffered various disasters to varying degrees. In mid-July, drought turned into flooding. Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, Taihang, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and Northern Yue regions all suffered from floods, especially Southern Hebei. According to statistics from the first, second, third, and fourth special districts of the region, 4,268,456 mu of land were flooded, accounting for more than one-eighth of the cultivated area of the entire region. Seedlings were completely submerged, resulting in no harvest on 698,000 mu of land, and 1,411 villages were affected by the disaster. The second is insect pests, which have been found to include locusts, armyworms, aphids, rice insects, white moths, etc. The insect pest area in Southern Hebei has spread from 14 counties to 41 counties, and autumn crops have been greatly damaged. In Central Hebei, more than 3,000 villages in 27 counties have suffered from insect pests. In the most severely affected Shulu County, 70% of the crops were damaged. According to statistics from ten counties in Taihang, locust plagues damaged 25,000 mu of autumn seedlings. Insect pests were also found in some areas of 14 counties in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. In addition, Taihang, Taiyue, Southern Chahar, Northern Yan, and other places have successively suffered from hail disasters. According to statistics from nine counties in Taihang, 32,000 mu of crops were damaged. According to hail disaster statistics from Qinyuan Anze and other five counties in the first district of Taiyue, a total of about 15,000 to 20,000 mu of autumn seedlings were destroyed. Based on the above situation, leaders in various places urgently called on the masses to carry out flood prevention, pest control, replanting, and seedling protection. In terms of flood prevention and water management, the Hebei Central and Southern Hebei Administrative Offices have successively convened special flood prevention meetings. Each county has established a flood prevention headquarters or flood prevention committee. Major cadres personally went to the flooded areas to lead the masses in rushing to repair breaches and dredging and reinforcing embankments. In Pingxiang County, Southern Hebei, more than 2,000 zhang of dangerous works were repaired in three days. In various places in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, rivers were dredged and drained in advance. 1,500 qing of farmland were rescued on both sides of the Xiao River, and 1,000 qing of autumn seedlings were protected. Currently, the masses are continuing to be organized to protect embankments and prevent dangers, and the Tuhai River in Gaotang territory is being dredged, completing 160,000 cubic meters of earthwork in ten days. The Taihang and Northern Henan county governments organized the masses to rush to repair the breaches. Within a week, all the breaches in the Qin River, Mang River, Guangji River, Yunliang River, Qi River, Anyang River, Dan River, Fuyang River, and Wei River were blocked, and more than 30 qing of wasteland were opened up for disaster victims, most of which were planted with autumn vegetables. Raoyang County in Central Hebei also blocked all 44 water holes and 689 animal holes in the Hutuo River embankment in a short period of time. Currently, except for Southern Hebei, Central Hebei, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan, which are continuing to dredge and drain rivers, the floods in other areas have been overcome. In terms of pest control, party and government agencies in various affected areas are vigorously organizing, and some areas have already achieved victories. The locust plague in 17 counties in Taihang and Northern Henan was quickly eradicated due to the region's experience in locust eradication in 1944. Southern Hebei is currently launching a region-wide pest control campaign. Ideological mobilization and organizational guarantees have overcome the superstition, disorganization, and paralysis of some of the masses. Pest control teams have been formed in Pingxiang and other places. In Aixing Village alone, 1,698 jin of insects were captured in one day. In Yixian, Mancheng, Tangxian, Wanxian, Xushui and other counties in Western Hebei, after the discovery of insect pests, county and district cadres rushed to the affected areas to lead the masses in capturing and beating them. In Lingnan Village, Yixian County, men, women, old and young were mobilized to rescue 112 mu of autumn seedlings in four days. In the hail-stricken areas, in addition to allocating grain for relief, the government mainly organized the masses to replant late autumn crops, calling on the masses to help each other and engage in production for self-rescue. The Central Hebei Administrative Office allocated 1.8 million jin of loans and disaster relief grain, and organized cooperatives, promotion societies, and state-owned stores in various counties to go to the disaster areas to help the masses in production, proposing \"different production methods for different regions.\" Renqiu County organized 31 villages including Liangou to fish, and Anping County Promotion Society purchased 22 dan of various vegetable seeds. State-owned stores allocated 6,000 jin of cotton to supply disaster victims for replanting and weaving. Jinghai even organized more than 4,000 disaster victims to dig ground pears in Wen'anwa. In various disaster areas in Taihang, the experience of overcoming famine in 1942 and 1943 was carried forward, and various sideline productions were carried out. According to statistics from 73 villages in 9 counties including Pingding, Huguan, and Xiyang, sideline production has earned more than 24 million yuan and 898 shi of rice, wheat, and sorghum in the past month. In addition, cadres and the masses in various places have also launched a movement to save and prepare for famine.\n    In non-disaster areas and areas with less severe disasters, the government vigorously led the masses to hoe and topdress to increase production. The Taiyue Administrative Office specially issued 30,000 yuan in topdressing and wheat planting loans, mobilizing labor heroes, production models, and mutual aid team leaders to take the lead in implementing three hoeings and topdressing. A campaign to supplement fertilizer and hoe seedlings was launched in various parts of Taihang. Li Shunda's exemplary action in leading the hoeing and topdressing of seedlings in Pingshun promoted the universal three hoeings and topdressing in the county. According to statistics from 83 villages in the county, 40% of the 85,457 mu of autumn fields in 1,144 mutual aid teams were hoeed three times and universally topdressed. Among them, 31,000 mu of cotton have been hoeed four times.\n    In addition, preparations are being made for the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In terms of the autumn harvest, Taihang, Taiyue, Northern Yue and other regions have successively issued instructions, concentrating efforts to organize and lead during the autumn harvest period, especially in the border areas, where labor and military should be combined to actively attack the enemy and smash the enemy's conspiracy to seize grain. The Taihang Administrative Office and Military Region have jointly issued an autumn protection order. In the border areas such as Northern Henan, militia cadres are being trained and the autumn protection work is being specifically arranged. As for wheat planting preparation, arrangements have been made in various places early. The Taihang Third Special Office instructed various counties and farms to conduct in-depth research in rural areas on the causes of wheat diseases this year, and find seeds suitable for local soil and climate for the masses to sow. Pingshan, Huolu and other counties in Northern Yue are repairing and dredging various canals in order to provide shade for wheat planting after autumn. Most areas of Southern Hebei are actively reclaiming wasteland in preparation for expanding wheat fields. In Guangping's first and second districts alone, more than 20 qing of wasteland have been opened up. In addition, great achievements have been made in fertilizer accumulation in various places. Jinan Fourth District in Taiyue has accumulated 967 carts of manure, another 3,652 dan, cut more than 43,000 bundles of Artemisia annua, purchased 31,200 jin of sesame cakes, and prepared 295 mu of sheep bedding land.\n    The achievements made in agricultural production in August in various places are closely related to the fact that various places have corrected policies, corrected deviations, concentrated on training village cadres, consolidated districts, and clearly declared the end of land reform. After training, village cadres in various places clarified the purpose of land reform and party rectification, and production work improved with the improvement of cadres' morale. In addition, some areas have rectified cooperatives and mutual aid societies, which have also played a significant role in promoting production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北八月份的农业生产——战胜灾害·保护秋苗·准备秋收种麦\n\n1948-09-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华北八月份的农业生产\n    ——战胜灾害·保护秋苗·准备秋收种麦\n    【本报讯】战胜灾害保护秋苗与准备秋收种麦，为华北解放区八月份农业生产之中心课题，各地均已获得很大成绩。全区均遭程度不同的各种灾害，七月中旬转早为涝，冀南、冀中、太行、冀鲁豫及北岳等区均遭水灾，尤以冀南为最，据该区一、二、三、四四个专区统计，被淹地四百廿六万八千四百五十六亩，占全区耕地面积八分之一强，小苗被淹全无收成者达六十九万八千亩，被灾村达一千四百一十一村。其次是虫灾，已发现者有蝗虫、黏虫、蚜虫、稻虫、白蛾虫等，冀南虫灾区已由十四县蔓延至四十一县，秋禾大受损伤。冀中廿七县三千余村遭虫灾，最严重之束鹿县禾苗被咬坏十分之七。太行蝗灾，据十县统计，损坏秋苗二万五千亩。冀鲁豫区亦有十四个县部分地区发现虫灾。此外太行、太岳、察南、雁北等地先后遭雹灾，据太行九个县统计，打坏庄稼三万二千亩，据太岳一分区沁源安泽等五县雹灾统计，共打毁秋苗约一万五千亩到两万亩。根据上述情况，各地领导上紧急号召群众进行防汛、灭虫、补种保苗斗争。在防汛治水方面，冀中、冀南两行署曾先后专门召开防汛会议，各县成立防汛指挥部或防汛委员会，各主要干部亲赴泛区，率领群众抢险堵口、浚河培堤，冀南平乡县三天即修好二千多丈长险工。冀鲁豫各地，事先疏河排水，硝河两岸救出田地一千五百顷，保住千顷秋苗。现正继续组织群众拥堤防险，并将高唐境内之徒骇河浚好，十天完成了十六万方土工程。太行豫北各县政府，组织群众抢险，终在不满一周的时间内，把沁河、漭河、广济河、运粮河、淇河、安阳河、丹河、滏阳河及卫河上百处决口全部堵住，并组织灾民开熟荒三十余顷，大部种上秋菜。冀中饶阳县亦于短期内，将滹沱河堤水洞四十四个，兽穴六百八十九个全部堵死。现除冀南、冀中、冀鲁豫仍继续浚河排水外，其它地区之水灾已形克服。在扑灭虫害方面，各受害区党政机关正大力组织，并已有部分地区取得胜利，太行豫北等地十七县之蝗灾，由于该区发挥了一九四四年剿蝗经验，蝗灾迅速得到扑灭。冀南全区现正展开全区性的灭虫运动，以思想动员与组织保证克服了某些群众的迷信、涣散与麻痹等现象，平乡等地组成捕虫队，仅艾辛一村，一天即捕虫一千六百九十八斤。冀西易县、满城、唐县、完县、徐水等县，自发现虫害后，各县县区干部即赶到各受灾区，率领群众捕打，易县岭南村男女老少齐动员，四天救出秋苗一百一十二亩。在各雹灾区，政府除拨粮救济外，主要是组织群众补种晚秋作物，号召群众互济互助，生产自救。冀中行署拨发贷粮赈粮一百八十万斤外，并组织各县合作社、推进社及公营商店，到灾区去扶助群众生产，提出“不同地区组织不同生产门路”。任邱县组织梁沟等三十一村捕鱼，安平县推进社购买各种菜籽二十二石。公营商店拨出棉花六千斤，供给灾民补种和纺织。静海更组织四千余灾民到文安洼去挖地梨。太行各灾区，发扬一九四二、四三年渡荒经验，进行各种副业生产，据平定、壶关、昔阳等九县七十三个村统计，月来副业生产共赚钱二千四百余万元，米麦和高粱八百九十八石。此外，各地干部群众还展开了节约备荒运动。\n    各非灾区和受灾较轻地区，政府大力领导群众多锄上追肥，以增加产量。太岳行署特发放追肥及种麦贷款三万万元，发动劳动英雄、生产模范、互助组长等带头，贯彻三锄上追肥。太行各地展开了补肥锄苗运动。平顺李顺达领导锄苗上追肥的模范行动，推动了全县普遍三锄与上追肥，据该县八十三个村统计，一千一百四十四个互助组共有秋田八万五千四百五十七亩，就有百分之四十锄了三遍，并普遍上了追肥。其中三万一千亩棉花已锄了四遍。\n    此外则为准备秋收种麦。在秋收方面，太行、太岳、北岳等区，均先后发出指示，在秋收期间，集中力量进行组织与领导，特别在边沿区，要劳武结合，主动进攻敌人，粉碎敌人的抢粮阴谋，太行行署与军区已联合发出保秋令。豫北等边沿区，正集训民兵干部，具体布置保秋工作。至于种麦准备，各地亦早有布置，太行三专署指示各县及农场，深入农村研究今年小麦病害原因，找出适合各地土质气候之种籽供群众播种。北岳平山、获鹿等县正修浚各水渠，以便秋后荫地种麦，冀南大部地区积极垦荒，准备扩大麦田，仅广平一二两区，即已开出荒地二十余顷。此外，各地积肥工作亦获很大成绩，仅太岳晋城四区即已积粪九百六十七车，另三千六百五十二担，割青蒿四万三千多捆，购麻饼三万一千二百斤，卧羊地二百九十五亩。\n    各地能在八月农业生产中获得如许成绩，与各地端正政策，纠正偏向集训村干巩固区明确宣布土改结束等有密切关系，各地村干经集训后，明确了土改整党目的，生产工作随干部情绪之提高而提高，其它还有些地区进行了整顿合作社与互助社，亦给生产的推进起了不少作用。"

    "content": "Insect Pests Still Severe in North China\n  　Leaders at All Levels Should Vigorously Organize Continued Eradication\n    [This newspaper dispatch] In recent months, insect pests have occurred successively in various places. In Jinnan, with the exception of Linqing, all the remaining forty-one counties have been universally affected, with the second and fourth districts being the most severely affected. In Jizhong, twenty-seven counties (including Xinji City), more than 3,400 villages, and in the fifth district of Beiyue, the seven counties of Yi, Man, Xu, Ding, Wan, Tang, and Wang, more than 170 villages in thirty districts, as well as the Jingxing area of the fourth special district and the Wei County area of the sixth special district, have also experienced insect pests. Secondly, in the Taihang area, after locusts were captured and eliminated in seventeen counties, small insects and black ladybugs have now appeared in the valleys of She County, Qi County, Neiqiu, Wu'an, and Lin County; Insect pests have also occurred in individual areas of Taiyue and Jilu豫 (Chengwu, Neihuang, Shanghe, etc.). Among them, the most harmful are armyworms, aphids, corn borers, and locust nymphs. In more than a dozen counties in Jinnan, such as Yuanchao, En County, Feixiang, Nangong, Fudong, and Hengshui, the most severely affected areas have four or five corn borers per corn stalk. Once the corn is bitten by insects, the ears immediately wither and fall over. In the third district of Guangping, corn affected by insect pests accounts for 50%, and other areas have armyworms and various other pests, and the disaster is quite common. Feixiang and Qizhi have the most severe locust nymphs eating grain. In Jizhong, the ninth and eleventh districts are more severely affected by insect pests, with the most severely affected villages accounting for 26-27% of the affected villages, and some areas have no harvest. In the four districts of insect-affected counties, statistics show that more than 33,000 mu of crops and 152,471 mu of cotton have been damaged. More than 1,000 mu of cotton in Beiyi Village, Bono, has no harvest, some cotton has been completely replanted, and even those that have not been replanted have suffered a 60% reduction in yield. In Shulu, armyworms initially occurred only in the ninth district, but now they are also commonly found in the fifth, fourteenth, and seventeenth districts. In the Shancheng area of the fifth district, the late grain has had its ears eaten by insects. Secondly, in Luancheng, Zhao County, Ningjin, Shulu, Shen County, and Anguo, the disaster is also very serious in most areas. The heavy grain and late corn are bitten into bare stalks, and the light ones are also bitten into mottled leaves. Armyworms have universally occurred in the counties of Yi, Man, Xu, Ding, Wan, Tang, and Wang in the fifth district of Beiyue. Most of them have just been eradicated, and black small armyworms have universally occurred. Statistics show that in addition to grain, corn, and cotton, other rice (Anxin, Pingshan), mung beans (Renqiu), and sorghum (Qinghe) have also been damaged by insects in some areas. Thus, insect pests in various regions have caused widespread disasters.\n    At present, Party, government, military, and civilians schools in various places are combining with the broad masses to enthusiastically carry out insect eradication campaigns, adopting various effective methods for insect eradication, and have achieved great results and experience:\n    　　　　Some Counties and Districts Do Not Pay Enough Attention, Resulting in the Spread of Insect Pests Throughout the Area\n    (1) The first is that the leadership attaches importance to grasping and eliminating them: On August 4th, the Fifth Special District of Beiyue discovered that armyworms had occurred in various counties, and immediately issued two notices, calling on all Party, government, and civilian cadres to earnestly supervise and inspect with the spirit of being responsible to the people, and to conscientiously prevent development, and immediately conducted capture and suppression in areas where insect pests had occurred. Chen Xi, the county head of Mancheng, personally led a pest inspection team to inspect various districts and help the masses capture and suppress pests. In the XuShui county-level agencies, in addition to the personnel left behind by the agencies, combined with the training class to help the village residents capture and suppress, and the rest of the cadres went to the countryside to fight armyworms. At present, the first batch of yellow old armyworms has been largely eliminated, and the second batch of black small armyworms is being eliminated. After the discovery of insect pests in the second district of Jinnan, the prefectural committee personally instructed the counties on the telephone, that wherever insect pests were discovered, the masses should be immediately organized to eliminate them. The areas that have now been basically eliminated are Jize, Yuanchao, Qiu County, and two districts in Qinghe, ten districts in Gaotang, the northern part of four districts in Wu'an, and the southern part of two districts in Xiajin. Some are also starting to act while calling on others. On August 14th, the Eleventh District of Jizhong issued an emergency call to all levels of the Party, government, military, and civilians in the district, vigorously organizing the elimination of pests. Comrade Guo Fang, secretary of the prefectural committee, personally led 47 cadres from the agency, combined with the Party school and the No. 2 Middle School, to help the masses catch insects in the fields. Within five days, they generally sprayed the insects twice on more than 1,700 mu of land, and even six times in some cases, which had a great impact on the masses. However, in some places, they do not pay attention to insect pests. For example, in many areas of the counties in the eighth district of Jizhong, armyworms and fire spiders have appeared, and some areas are even very serious, such as some villages in the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth districts of Xianjiao. Facing such insect pests, they actually used the excuse that the young and middle-aged people were all on the embankment to block the water, and it was difficult to mobilize the masses, so they ignored them. The ninth district of Renqiu initially completely ignored the discovery of insect pests, and even when it spread throughout the district, it still focused on \"distributing floating wealth and sweeping the tails of the land.\" Although it was reviewed and changed later, it was too late, causing the masses to suffer avoidable losses.\n    (2) The most important thing is to mobilize the masses and organize the masses, and use practical examples to overcome the superstitious ideas and concerns of the masses: When armyworms were first discovered in Chaigezhuang, Wan County, the village deputy asked the masses to contribute 10,000 yuan per household, and collected 256,000 yuan to buy livestock to offer to the \"Insect King\", but the pests became more and more rampant. On August 3rd, after the cadres of the county's industrial department and three comrades from the Border Region Technology Promotion Brigade arrived in the village, they seized the example of Yin Dezi, who went hungry two years ago because he did not fight armyworms, to educate the masses, and mobilized and helped the masses to capture and suppress them. When armyworms were rampant two years ago, Yin Dezi was superstitious and did not fight insects, and the crops were eaten up by insects, and he went hungry himself. This year, as soon as he saw armyworms in the field, he and his mother pushed the armyworm cart to the field to capture and suppress them without waiting for the cadres to mobilize. He said: \"Whoever wants to believe in gods can believe in them, anyway, I don't believe in them. The previous year hurt me, and I went hungry myself if I couldn't grow food!\" The masses in the whole village were organized, and 23 village cadres were responsible for each street and area, and the armyworms on more than 400 mu of land were killed in three days.\n    　　　　On-the-Spot Education to Break Superstition; Free Association to Help Each Other Eradicate Insects\n    In addition, special attention should be paid to the method of fighting insects: In the Wencheng Township area of Jizhong, 16 villages with 1,043 mu of land had armyworms. Some villages let the masses fight in a disorganized manner, a large group of people squeezed the nodules in the field, and the children trampled and ran around, destroying more than seven mu of grain, which caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Cao Xingbang's daughter-in-law said: \"Are you catching insects for me? You are hitting my rice bowl!\" Sun Jichen of Dabao Village blocked the insect eradication team from entering the field at the edge of the field and said: \"You must give me the grain, I will cut all the grain, or it will be ruined and there will be no food.\" After hitting a snag, the district and village cadres made a review, mainly because they did not listen to the masses and subjectively forced the masses to collect insects collectively. A forum for landowners was also held, and according to the opinions of the masses, small groups were freely and voluntarily formed, and the whole family went to the field to encourage everyone to protect crops and eliminate pests. The masses in Zhao Village went to the field early in the morning with ducks. The people in the front knocked, and the ducks in the back followed to eat. Zhan Baotang said: \"This is so good, it doesn't ruin the crops and it's fast to catch.\" After the transformation of the method in Nanchengzi, Tang County, the heads of households mobilized the whole family to combine with the neighbors and the land to go to the field to catch insects, and the enthusiasm was very high and the efficiency was great. Similar examples can be found in Anguo in Jizhong and Jize and Nangong in Jinnan. In addition, specific leadership and unified action have been noted. Nanliushan and other villages in Suning proposed that \"if one family does not take it, the four neighbors will suffer, and everyone will help each other to supervise and help capture.\" The whole village organized an insect control committee to lead in a unified manner, and the cadres were responsible for taking care of the three families of military martyrs and industrial workers and the lonely and widowed without labor, and they did not let the insects damage the crops. The cadres of Hongshan Village in Wu'an, Taihang, led the masses to catch black ladybugs. Everyone took a small pocket and caught two or three he of insects in half a day. After catching them for more than four days, they have already eliminated 70-80%.\n    (3) Timely inspection and proactive prevention: Director Luo of the Jizhong Administrative Office went to the field on August 16 to inspect the insect pests. After discovering armyworms, he immediately instructed the agencies to organize and help the village residents to eliminate the pests, and showed the captured armyworms to the masses to attract the attention of the villagers. Comrade Gou Zhengge of the Brigade Department of the Second District of Yi County heard that insect pests had been discovered in neighboring villages, so he immediately went to the field to inspect. After the discovery of armyworms in Wanglizhangtun Village, the fifth district of Zaoqiang, they dug long ditches more than one foot deep and wide around the edges of the land where armyworms had not been discovered, with smooth ditch walls and small pits at one end. The armyworms could not climb into the land and fell into the small pits, and they were buried alive when there were too many. As soon as Wang Ruxing in Qudi Village, Anguo, had insects in his field, he held a family meeting and mobilized the women of the whole family to go to the field to fight insects, and the crops were not damaged.\n    At present, although a campaign to eliminate insect pests has been universally launched in various places, and considerable achievements have been made, the insect disaster has not yet passed, and some areas are still continuing to spread and develop. In particular, autumn locusts, cabbage worms, black ladybugs, mole crickets, grubs (eating wheat), and armyworms have not yet exceeded the breeding season. Therefore, leaders at all levels should pay special attention to this work, resolutely overcome the paralysis of cadres and the superstitious ideas of the masses, and make further efforts to eliminate insect pests and strive for the final victory in agricultural production this year.\n  　　　　　　　(Zhao Changcheng, Department of Agriculture)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北各地虫害仍严重　各级领导上应大力组织继续扑灭\n赵长城\n1948-09-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华北各地虫害仍严重\n  　各级领导上应大力组织继续扑灭\n    【本报讯】近月来各地陆续发生虫害。冀南除临清外，其余四十一县普遍发生，其中以二、四分区最重。冀中二十七个县（辛集市在内）三千四百多村、北岳五分区易、满、徐、定、完、唐、望七县三十个区一百七十多村及四专井陉、六专蔚县一带也都有虫害发生，其次在太行十七县蝗虫捕灭后，现涉县、淇县、内邱、武安、林县的谷地，又发生了小虫和黑婆虫；太岳、冀鲁豫（城武、内黄、尚和等县）个别地区也有虫害发生。其中为害最大的是黏虫、蚜虫、钻心虫和蝗蝻，在冀南元朝、恩县、肥乡、南宫、阜东、衡水等十几个县，虫害最严重的地方，每棵棒子上有钻心虫四、五个，棒子一经虫咬，穗子立刻枯萎歪倒。广平三区受虫害棒子占百分之五十，其他地区发生黏虫、火笼各种害虫，灾情相当普遍。肥乡、企之均发生蝗蝻吃谷最厉害。冀中以九、十一两个分区虫灾较重，其中灾情最重的村子占灾村百分之二十六、七，有的地区已无收成。虫县四区二十七个村，统计被咬坏庄稼三万三千多亩，棉花十五万二千四百七十一亩。博野北邑村一千多亩棉花已无收成，有的棉花已经全部毁种，就是没毁种的也已减收六成。束鹿最初只九区发生黏虫，现在五区、十四区、十七区也普遍发见，五区鄯城一带晚谷被虫吃掉谷穗码子。其次栾城、赵县、宁晋、束鹿、深县、安国，大部地区灾情也很严重，谷子、晚棒子重的咬成光秆，轻的也咬成花叶。北岳五专易、满、徐、定、完、唐、望各县普遍发生了黏虫，大部刚刚扑灭，黑色小黏虫又普遍发生，统计庄稼受害的除谷子棒子和棉花外，其他稻子（安新、平山）绿豆（任邱）高粱（清河）也有部分地区被虫咬坏，如此各地区虫害已造成普遍性的灾害。\n    现在各地党政军民学校结合广大群众，正在热烈的开展着除虫运动。采用各种除虫有效办法，获得很大成绩和经验：\n    　　　　有些县区重视不够　致使虫灾蔓延全区\n    （一）首先是领导上重视抓紧扑灭：北岳五专在八月四日发见各县发生黏虫，立即发出两次通知，号召党政民全体干部以为人民负责的精神，切实督促检查，认真防止发展，并即在已发生虫害地区进行捕打。满城县长陈希亲带害虫检查组到各区检查，帮助群众捕打。徐水县级机关除留守机关人员结合训练班帮助驻村捕打，其余全体干部下乡打黏虫，现第一番黄色老黏虫大体扑灭，正在进行第二番扑灭黑色小黏虫。冀南二分区虫害发现后，地委亲在电话上指示各县，那里发现害虫，立即组织群众扑灭，现已基本上消灭的有鸡泽、元朝、邱县和清河两个区，高唐十区，武安四区北部，夏津二区南部。有的还一面号召一面动手，冀中十一分区于八月十四日向全区各级党政军民发出紧急号召，大力组织扑灭害虫，地委书记郭芳同志亲自带领机关干部四十七人结合党校和二中下地帮助群众捕虫，五天内把一千七百多亩地内的虫普遍打了两遍，有的甚至六遍，影响群众很大。但也有一些地方，对虫灾不重视，如冀中八分区各县的不少地区出了黏虫、火蛛子，有的地区甚至很严重，如献交六、七、八、九、十等区的一部分村庄，对这样的虫灾，竟借口青壮年都上堤挡水，发动群众有困难而置之不管。任邱九区最初发现虫害完全置之不理，到蔓延全区时，仍以“分浮财，扫土地尾巴”为中心，后虽经检讨转变，但为时已晚，使群众遭受了本可避免的损失。\n    （二）最主要是发动群众组织群众，用实际例子来克服群众的迷信思想和顾虑：完县柴各庄开始发见黏虫时，村副让群众每户出一万元，共集了廿五、六万元买牲羊供献“虫王”，但是害虫却越闹越多。八月三日县实业科干部和边区技术推广大队三个同志到村后，便抓住该村尹德子前年不打黏虫挨饿的例子教育群众，发动和帮助群众捕打。尹德子前年闹黏虫时迷信不打虫，庄稼被虫吃光，自己挨了饿。今年一见地里有了黏虫不等干部动员就和他娘推着黏虫车下地捕打。他说：“谁愿信神谁就信，反正我是不信了，前年个一年把我治伤了，打不下粮食自己挨饿！”全村群众组织起来，二十三个村干部，分街分片负责，三天打完了四百多亩地的黏虫。\n    　　　　实地教育打破迷信　自由结组互助灭虫\n    此外，特别注意打虫的方式：冀中文新城厢区有十六个村一千零四十三亩地出了黏虫。有的村无组织的让群众乱打，一大群人到地里乱挤疙疸，儿童们乱踩乱跑，踏坏了七亩多谷子，引起群众的不满。曹兴邦的媳妇说：“这是给俺拿虫吗？是打我饭碗子来啦！”大堡村孙继臣在地头拦着不让打虫队进地，并说：“一定要给我拿，我就把谷子都割喽，要不也得糟塌的不打粮食了。”碰了钉子以后，区村干部做了检讨，主要是不听群众的话，主观的强迫群众集体拿虫。又召开了地户座谈会，根据群众意见自由自愿结合了小组，全家都下地，鼓动大家保护庄稼消灭害虫。赵村的群众带着鸭子一早下地，前边人磕打，后边鸭子跟着吃，斩保堂说：“这多好，又不糟塌庄稼又拿的快。”唐县南城子在转变方式以后，各户家长动员全家结合邻居地邻二律下地拿虫子，情绪很高，效率很大。冀中安国，冀南鸡泽、南宫，均有同样的例子。另外并已注意到具体领导和统一行动。肃宁南留善等村提出“一家不拿，四邻吃亏，大伙互助督促，帮助捕打。”全村组织捕虫委员会统一领导，三家没劳力的军烈工属和孤寡，干部们负责照顾也没叫虫子咬坏庄稼。太行武安洪山村干部带领群众捉黑婆虫，每人拿个小口袋，一个人半天捉二三合，捉了四天多已经消灭了七八成。\n    （三）即时检查主动预防：冀中行署罗主任于八月十六日亲到地里检查虫害，发见有黏虫以后，立即指示各机关组织起来帮助驻村扑灭害虫，又把捕到的黏虫让群众看，引起全村老乡注意。易县二区大队部苟振葛同志听说邻村发见虫害，就立刻到地里检查。枣强五区王里张屯村发见黏虫后，一面捕打一面在还没有发见黏虫的地边周围挖成深宽一尺多的长渠，渠壁光滑，一端有小坑，黏虫爬不到地里掉到小坑内，要多了就埋死它。安国曲堤村王汝兴地里刚一有虫就开了家庭会议，动员全家妇女下地打虫，庄稼没有受害。\n    目前，各地虽然普遍掀起扑灭虫害的运动，且获得不小的成绩，但虫灾仍未过去，有的地区还继续蔓延发展，特别是秋蝗、菜虫、黑婆虫、蝼蛄、蛴螬（吃麦子），黏虫亦尚未逾繁殖季节，因此各级领导应特别重视此一工作，坚决克服干部麻痹和群众的迷信思想，进一步努力把虫害扑灭，争取今年农业生产最后的胜利。\n  　　　　　　　（农业厅赵长城）"

On August 15th, when Kuomintang military police in Kunming besieged patriotic students participating in the movement against the US policy of supporting Japanese aggression against China, in addition to shooting and wounding more than 150 students on the spot with rifles and machine guns, they also arrested 400 to 500 students, of whom 337 were sent to the summer camp, a disguised concentration camp, for \"training.\"\n    △ According to a TASS report on August 9th, citing the Nanjing Central University Weekly, Li Hongbang (transliteration), a student of Central University, was arrested on his way from Chongqing to Chengdu. The report stated that two secret agents and three armed soldiers found a Chinese translation of a selected collection of works by the old Russian writer Pushkin in the student's luggage.

    "content": "Great Achievements in Afforestation in Taihang\n  　More Than 2.8 Million Trees Planted This Spring\n    [Taihang Telegram] The afforestation and construction work in the Taihang area, under the active leadership, support, and encouragement of our democratic government, is gradually expanding in scale and development. In 1946, twelve counties planted a total of more than 2.03 million trees, three counties restored 714 \"forbidden mountains,\" and seven counties established 395 nurseries. In 1947, incomplete statistics from fifteen counties and cities showed that more than 1.5 million trees were planted, averaging more than five trees per person. This year's three-month spring afforestation campaign, drawing on past experience and adopting the guiding principle of universal mobilization and focused promotion, has achieved greater success than any previous year. According to statistics from twelve counties and cities including Xingtai, and six hundred and thirty villages in ten counties including Lucheng and Zanhuang, and both sides of the Handan-Changzhi Highway and the Qin River: a total of more than 2,276,000 timber trees and more than 565,000 fruit trees were planted. The total number of trees planted this spring is more than 2,842,000. Some areas have also carried out tree protection, pruning, and grafting work. Lingchuan County alone pruned more than 73,000 trees. Two districts in Pingshun grafted more than 6,700 timber trees. Secondly, various places have restored and established \"forbidden mountains\" and \"forbidden forests.\" The total area of Songshan Mountain in Heshun County is about 150,000 mu, directly led by the county, and a management system of nearly 10,000 mu has been established. Xiangyuan and Wuxiang restored 1,675.9 mu of \"forbidden mountains.\" In Lai County, a management system has been established for 150 mountain forests. In the Changzhi and Yincheng area, a forest area of about fifteen li, and the Xishan forest area in Xigou, Lingchuan, and man-made pine and cypress trees have all restored forest protection management.\n    In order to build a long-term afforestation foundation and solve the problem of tree seedling shortage in afforestation, various places have also established a large number of nurseries in recent years. The Guancun Nursery of the Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has supplied more than 46,850 tree seedlings of various kinds to counties such as Licheng, Lucheng, Pingshun, Huguan, and Changzhi, as well as the Handan-Changzhi Highway. The Kangzhuang Nursery of the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau supplied tens of thousands of cypress seedlings to the masses. The nurseries in Dalian South, ＠ North, and Ganquan villages in Pingshun supplied 11,895 tree seedlings, accounting for 48.9% of the total tree seedling source of the three villages. The private nursery of labor hero Liu Jubao in Lucheng supplied more than 2,000 seedlings to the masses. In addition, various places have also discovered and utilized a large number of natural nurseries. For example, in the Shahe Beach Forest Area, twenty-six villages, nine of which discovered more than 1,740 mu of natural nursery seedlings, ranging from one and a half feet to five feet in height. This spring, Yushe and Heshun counties established ninety new village nurseries. She County and Lin County established more than 2,400 mu. The discovery, establishment, and renovation of a large number of nurseries have laid a favorable foundation for future afforestation. During this spring's afforestation campaign, attention was also paid to forest protection work, and many areas established forest protection organizations and systems. For example, in Hengling Village, Heshun, a dedicated person is responsible, and the masses take turns providing meals. There has been no loss of a single tree for three or four years. Yushe pays attention to organizing cattle, sheep, workers, and children to participate in the forest management committee, and also organizes the use of manure and red mud to smear the trees to prevent sheep from eating them. The management method for tree planting on the Handan-Changzhi Road adopts tree tagging, barbed wire fencing, regular watering, and replanting as soon as trees die. Various places have also stipulated compensation and punishment methods, stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses for forest protection.\n  　　　　　(Jia Bufei)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行造林成绩大　今春植树二百八十多万株\n夏步非\n1948-09-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行造林成绩大\n  　今春植树二百八十多万株\n    【太行电】太行区的植树造林建设工作，经过我民主政府的积极领导与扶助奖励，其规模与成绩逐渐在扩大与发展中。一九四六年十二个县共植树二百零三万多株，三个县恢复禁山七百一十四设，七个县建立苗圃三百九十五处。一九四七年十五个县市的不完全统计，共植树一百五十余万株，每人平均五株以上。今年三个月的春季植树造林运动，接受以往经验，采取普遍号召重点推动的指导方针，取得了超过以往任何一年的巨大成绩。根据邢台等十二个县市，及潞城赞皇等十个县六百三十个村，和邯长公路两旁、沁河两岸等的统计：共栽木材树二百廿七万六千多株，栽果木树五十六万五千多株。总计今春植树二百八十四万二千多株。有些地区并进行了保树修树接木工作，陵川一个县，即修树七万三千多株。平顺两个区接材木树六千七百多株。其次各地并恢复和建立了禁山、禁林。和顺全县松山总面积在十五万亩左右，由县直接领导，建立了近万亩的管理制度。襄垣，武乡恢复禁山一千六百七十五亩九分。涞县一百五十处山林，已建立了管理制度。长治、荫城一带，长约十五里面积之山林，及陵川西沟的西山林区，及人造松柏，均恢复了护林管理。\n    为建设长期植树造林基础，解决植树造林中的树秧困难，数年来各地并大量建立了苗圃，长治农林局的关村苗圃，供给黎城、潞城、平顺、壶关、长治等各县及邯长公路的各种树秧即达四万六千八百五十余株。邢台农林局的康庄苗圃，供给群众只柏树秧即数万株，平顺大梁南、＠北、甘泉三村的苗圃供树秧一万一千八百九十五株。占该三村全部树秧来源百分之四十八·九。潞城劳动英雄刘巨宝的私人苗圃供给群众植秧两千多株，此外各地并大量的发现与利用天然苗圃，如沙河滩林区，二十六个村，即有九个村发现一千七百四十余亩天然铺场苗秧，高达一尺半至五尺。今春新建立的村苗圃榆社、和顺两县即有九十处。涉县林县两县建立了二千四百余亩，大量苗圃的发现、建立与修整，对今后植树造林打下了有利的基础。今春的植树造林运动中，同时注意了护林工作，不少地区建立了护林组织与制度。如和顺横岭村，确定一个专人负责，群众轮流管饭，现已有三四年没有损失一棵树，榆社注意组织牛羊工儿童参加林木管理委员会，又组织用粪和红泥土抹树以免羊腊。邯长路植树管理的办法，采用树木挂牌，围圪针，定期浇树，随死随栽，各地并规定了偿罚办法，刺激了群众护林的积极性。\n  　　　　　（贾步非）"

    "content": "Column: Inquiry and Reply\n\n　　Employing Long-Term Laborers by New Rich Peasants Does Not Constitute Feudal Exploitation\n\nTo the Editors:\n    Currently, our streets are covered with slogans promoting vigorous production and striving for wealth. We are also singing songs of vigorous production, calling on everyone to work hard and learn from the good examples of labor heroes in building up their families through labor. However, the masses say that some labor heroes, such as Wu Manyou, own a lot of land, raise cattle, sheep, and donkeys, and also employ long-term laborers. Does this constitute feudal exploitation? Here, households that have employed long-term laborers have been classified as landlords or rich peasants. Are these newly emerged labor heroes not feudal elements? Is the classification of class status not based on land ownership and exploitative relationships? Then, what else are these households if not feudal rich peasants? The masses asked me, and I was stumped. Please provide a quick reply to avoid the masses having misgivings and hesitating to engage in bold production.\n    Liu Taiqi, Xiaotun Elementary School, Fourth District, Wu'an\n\n    Answer: Those who have risen to become rich peasants through labor and production with the support of the policies of the democratic government are not feudal rich peasants. Their land and property ownership is not derived from feudal exploitation but mainly from building up their families through labor. They should be considered new-style rich peasants. Although they employ long-term laborers, this constitutes capitalist exploitation, not feudal exploitation. They should be treated the same as prosperous middle peasants. Why is the exploitation by new-style rich peasants capitalist rather than feudal? The difference lies in the fact that the long-term laborers employed by new rich peasants have fundamental differences in political status and economic treatment compared to the feudal exploitation by old rich peasants. The former's employees and employers are completely equal in political status. The contract is voluntarily entered into by both parties. Employees can participate in peasant associations and village political activities. Naturally, the feudal servitude and abuse and humiliation of personality by employers against employees are eliminated. Economically, although employees are still exploited for their surplus value by employers, their general wage and living standards are guaranteed to a certain extent under the conditions of the contract between the two parties, and the arbitrary illegal exploitation, deduction, and other extra-economic exploitation by employers against employees are abolished.\n    The Party's policy is to allow the existence and development of new rich peasants. Comrade Ren Bishi clearly pointed out in \"Several Questions on Land Reform\": \"The existence of such rich peasants is not harmful to us. Moreover, it will continue to develop in the future. In the past, we encouraged such rich peasants, such as Wu Manyou, to develop their production, which played a great role in confirming the status of middle peasants and stimulating their enthusiasm for production. Our policy in the future should still be like this.\" Even in our North China, there are such examples, such as the labor hero Li Shunda in Taihang and Shi Zhenming in Taiyue. They all became wealthy through labor and have employed both long-term and short-term laborers, constantly receiving commendations and rewards from the Communist Party and the democratic government. This has played a significant role in stabilizing the middle peasants and stimulating their enthusiasm for production. This policy was correct in the past and is still correct now and will continue to be implemented in the future. In the future, employing long-term laborers and freely buying and selling land will still be allowed. Everyone can rest assured and boldly engage in production to get rich, and the government will definitely protect them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新富农雇用长工不算封建剥削\n刘太岐\n1948-09-13\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　新富农雇用长工不算封建剥削编辑同志：\n    现在我处各街都是写的开展大生产努力发家致富的标语，唱的也是大生产的歌子，都是号召大家努力生产，学习劳动英雄们劳动发家的好榜样，可是群众说，有些劳动英雄如吴满有等家里种着很多土地，喂着牛羊驴，并且还用着长工，这算不算封建剥削呢？在我们这里用过长工的户都按地主或富农清算了，这些新发的劳动英雄难道就不是封建吗？划分阶级不是按土地占有和剥削关系划分的吗？那么这些户不是封建富农是什么呢？群众问我，把我问住了，请快给以答复，以免群众心里有疙瘩不敢大胆生产。\n    武安四区小屯小学刘太岐\n    答：凡在民主政府政策的扶植下，而劳动生产上升为富农者，非封建富农，因其土地财产的占有，非由封建剥削所得，主要靠劳动起家，应是新式富农。虽然他们雇长工，但因其系资本主义式的剥削，而非封建剥削。对他们应和富裕中农同等看待。新式富农为什么是资本主义剥削而非封建剥削呢？其区别是新富农所雇佣的长工在政治地位和经济待遇上和旧富农的封建剥削都有基本的不同，前者雇工和雇主在政治上是完全平等的，契约是双方自愿订立的，雇工可以参加农会，可以参加村里的政治活动，自然更取消了雇主对雇工的封建性的奴役及人身人格上的虐待污辱等。在经济上，雇工虽还被雇主剥削其剩余价值，但一般工资生活待遇在双方契约条件下有一定保障，而废除了雇主对雇工的任意非法剥削克扣及其他超经济剥削。\n    党的政策是允许新富农的存在和发展的。任弼时同志在“土地改革的几个问题”中明确指出：“这种富农的存在对我们并无害处。而且在将来一个时期内还会发展的。过去我们鼓励这种富农，例如吴满有那样的人们，发展其生产，对于确定中农，刺激中农的生产热情，起了很大作用，我们今后的政策，还是应当如此。”即在咱们华北，也有这种例子，比如太行的劳动英雄李顺达，太岳的石振明等，他们都是劳动致富，曾雇用长短工，不断受到共产党和民主政府的表扬奖励。这对稳定中农刺激中农的生产热情起了很大作用。这个政策，过去现在都是正确的，今后还要继续执行，今后也允许雇长工，自由买卖土地，大家放心大胆的努力生产去发财，政府绝对加以保护。"

At the \"September 1st\" Journalist Day symposium for news workers in the Jin-Sui Border Region, Li Jingquan, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau, delivered a speech on various issues related to news work. He pointed out that the future direction for news workers is to deeply study the Party's policies and practical work. For example, specific experiences in Party rectification, political construction, production, and joining the army should be analyzed, studied, and summarized based on the Party's policies to guide the advancement of the movement. It would be even better if problems in practical work could be elevated to the theoretical level for discussion and debate. He encouraged everyone to improve themselves ideologically and theoretically. He also said that newspapers must overcome empirical reporting methods, otherwise, the newspapers will lag behind the actual movement. Newspapers should strengthen their combativeness and conduct criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings and errors in the movement. Only by clearly grasping the Party's policies, specifically analyzing practical problems, and correctly conducting criticism and self-criticism can the newspaper become a powerful weapon for promoting and guiding work, and become a combative newspaper. Comrade Li Jingquan pointed out the key points of future reporting: In terms of Party rectification, the main issue is transforming ideology and work style. How to unite the people and lead the mass work is something that must be well resolved in the future. It is not only necessary to report on the contact between individual Party members and the masses, but also to focus on reporting and studying how the Party branch strengthens its connection with the masses and plays a core and leading role in various tasks and movements. In terms of political construction: The People's Representative Conference led the land reform and also did a lot of work in production and disaster relief, joining the army and participating in the war, and supporting the front line, and generally did it very well. However, the People's Representative Conference and the government committee elected by it, this brand-new form of political power, is still in its infancy. How can it better lead the masses in daily work, how to establish a complete organization and work system, these are the issues that the newspaper should focus on publicizing and studying in the future. In terms of production: it is necessary to publicize and promote how to make production plans consciously and voluntarily through the masses, so that the production this winter and next spring will overcome blindness and create a planned large-scale production movement, and to continue to strengthen the publicity of policies through this movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥分局李井泉同志指示新闻工作  克服经验主义的报导方法　正确开展批评与自我批评\n\n1948-09-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥分局李井泉同志指示新闻工作\n    克服经验主义的报导方法\n  　正确开展批评与自我批评\n    【新华社晋绥十日电】在晋绥边区新闻工作者“九一”记者节座谈会上，中共中央晋绥分局书记李井泉曾就新闻工作诸问题，发表谈话。他指出新闻工作者今后努力方向是深入研究党的政策和实际工作。如对整党、建政、生产、参军各方面的具体经验，即应根据党的政策，经过分析研究，加以总结，以指导运动前进。如能把实际工作中的问题提高到理论上展开讨论与争论，那就更好。他勉励大家要从政策思想上、理论上提高自己。并且说：报纸要克服经验主义的报导方法，否则就会使报纸落后于实际运动。报纸要加强战斗性，对运动中的缺点和错误，要进行批评与自我批评。只有明确地掌握了党的政策，具体地分析实际问题，正确地开展批评与自我批评，这样才会使报纸成为推动与指导工作的有力武器，成为有战斗性的报纸。至此，李井泉同志指出今后报导的要点：在整党方面，主要是改造思想作风问题。如何团结人民，领导群众工作，这是今后必须很好解决的。不仅要报导党员个人与群众的联系，而且要着重报导及研究党的支部如何加强与群众的联系并在各种工作与运动中起核心与领导作用。建政方面：人民代表会议领导了土地改革，在生产救灾、参军参战、支援前线等方面也做了许多的工作，而且一般都做得很好，但人民代表会议及其选出的政府委员会这个崭新的政权形式还是个雏型，它如何才能更好的领导群众进行日常工作，如何建立一套完整的机构和工作制度，这是报纸今后应该着重宣传与研究的问题。生产方面：要宣传与提倡如何通过群众自觉自愿订生产计划，使今冬及明春的生产克服盲目性，造成有计划的大生产运动，并且要通过这个运动继续加强对政策的宣传。"

    "content": "[Taihang Telegram] After Lucheng, Shexian, Xiyang, and other counties corrected their policies and clarified their educational guidelines, cadres at all levels and the masses have begun to attach importance to and care about education. Teachers' morale has greatly improved, and there have also been new improvements in teaching methods. After studying the new education guidelines, a teacher at Shenquan Elementary School in Lucheng went to various households to explain that the main focus in the future would be on literacy, mobilizing 35 children in the village to enroll in school. In Zhushipu, Xiyang, there were a total of 117 school-age children, but only 21 attended school. The elementary school teacher in the village, on the one hand, used children to mobilize each other to enroll, and on the other hand, focused on the learning of existing children, using actual achievements to break through the thinking of children's parents. As a result, the number of students increased from 21 to 62. In order to change the past negative impression of the school among the masses and consolidate the children's enthusiasm, the teacher of Baicun in the first district compiled the academic achievements of each student in each semester into a rhythmic story and asked the children to go back and present their achievements to their parents. For example, after student Hou Yongen completed one book, the teacher compiled a rhythmic story based on his academic performance: \"Little model Hou Yongen, diligent in learning, writes well, writes truly, memorizes and writes two books thoroughly, and can also memorize and write the names of 27 villages.\" After the child went home and read it to his father, his father was very happy and bought Hou Yongen many slate pencils and hemp paper to encourage him to continue to study hard, and told others everywhere on the street: \"The school is different from before. Hou Yongen recognized so many characters in a few days and wrote through two thick books.\" In terms of teaching methods, the teacher at Zhushipu Elementary School was very patient when teaching children to recognize characters. Before each lesson, he wrote the new words on the blackboard, stroke by stroke, to teach students how to write and recognize them. Then, he opened the textbook and asked the children to read and explain it themselves. If there was anything they couldn't understand, everyone discussed it, and the teacher made a final supplement. When Qian Kuanzhang Elementary School in Shexian was on vacation to pick peppercorns, in order not to delay the students' studies, they made literacy cards for each student, copying the new words according to grade and textbook. In the morning, the children were asked to lead the cards to recognize the characters, and in the evening, they reported their results to the school. Due to the changes in educational guidelines and teaching methods, the number of enrolled children has generally increased, and the masses are very concerned about the school and the learning of their children. When the masses in Wujing Village, the first district of Hebei and Ping Shun, saw that the elementary school in their village had no desks or benches, they suggested to the teacher to ask the village education committee to find a way to repair them. Shu Richang, a villager in the village, saw that the school walls in his village were collapsing and the roof was leaking, so he automatically drove his two donkeys to carry bricks and soil for construction. Zhao Village Elementary School in the fifth district of Changzhi has overcome the past chaotic phenomena, and the masses reflected: \"There are not many schools like today. In the past, they didn't let their children study well, and they couldn't even recognize their own names in a year.\" Wang Guishan, a villager, saw that his son recognized many characters during this period, so he specially bought a slate and writing brush for his child when he went to Yincheng market and repeatedly told him to study hard.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 潞城等县纠正偏向后　小学教育大有转机\n\n1948-09-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　潞城等县纠正偏向后\n  　小学教育大有转机\n    【太行电】潞城、涉县、昔阳等县经过端正政策明确教育方针后，各级干部与群众对教育工作已开始重视和关心。教员情绪大大提高，在教学方法上亦有新的改进。潞城神泉小学教员学习回去后，经过深入各户解释新教育方针，说明今后主要以识字为主，动员了全村三十五个儿童入学。昔阳朱石铺学龄儿童共一百一十七人，但到校的仅二十一个，该村小学教员一方面运用儿童互相动员入学，同时抓紧现有儿童学习，用实际成绩打通儿童家长思想，结果由廿一个学生增至六十二个。一区白村教员为了转变过去群众对学校的不良印象和巩固儿童情绪，便把每个学生每学期的学业成绩编成快板，叫儿童回去给家长献成绩。如学生侯永恩学完一册后，教员便根据他的学习成绩编成快板：“小模范侯永恩，对学习肯用功，写的好，写的真，两本一册背写通，还能背写二十七个村名。”该儿童回家给他爸念后，他爸听了非常喜欢，给侯永恩买了许多石笔麻纸鼓励其继续好好用功，并在街上到处告别人说：“现在的学校可和以前不一样了，侯永恩不几天认了那么多的字，把厚厚的两本书都写通啦。”在教学方法上朱石铺小学教员教儿童认字时非常耐心，在每一课前先把课内生字写在黑板上，一笔一画叫学生写会认会，然后再翻开课本叫儿童自己念自己讲，有闹不通的地方大家讨论，教员最后作补充。涉县前宽漳小学在放假摘花椒时，为了不耽误学生学习，便给每一学生制了识字牌，按年级按课本把生字抄上，早上叫儿童领牌认字，黄昏时到校汇报成绩。由于教育方针及教学方式的转变，入学儿童都普遍增加，群众对学校和自己子弟的学习也非常关心。和平顺一区五井村群众看到本村小学没桌子没凳子便给教员建议要求村教育委员会设法修补，该村群众舒日昌看到本村小学校墙倒屋漏，便自动赶上自己的两头毛驴驮砖土修筑。长治五区赵村小学由于克服了过去混乱现象，群众反映说：“象今天这样的学校还是不多，过去不让孩子好好念书，一年连自己的名字都认不得”。该村王贵山看到自己儿子这一时期认字很多，到荫城赶集时特给自己小孩买下石板毛笔并再三嘱其努力学习。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th: Commander Wang Zhen recently spoke at a health cadre meeting of a certain column, offering great encouragement to the health workers of the troops. He praised the excellent qualities of medical and health workers in the People's Liberation Army, such as their hard work, self-sacrifice, and creativity. He pointed out that health work is one of the most important tasks for consolidating the troops and improving combat effectiveness. He said: \"In the past, some health workers did not realize the importance of health work, always thinking that bandaging, serving meals, wiping iodine, and taking care of bedpans were meaningless. Therefore, they had thoughts of changing careers. This is a manifestation of insufficient political awareness. At the same time, the lack of concern and attention from the leadership for health agencies has also affected the improvement of this work. If we calculate the general numbers of non-combat attrition and combat attrition, we will know how important the quality of medical work is to the completion of military tasks! Soldiers who suffer from diseases in the army are called non-combat attrition, or temporarily lose their combat effectiveness. Taking a certain unit as an example, those currently in the hospital account for two percent, and there are even more outpatient cases. Therefore, the quality of work of health agencies is of great significance to combat effectiveness. In addition, in combat attrition, those killed in action account for about one-quarter of the total casualties, and those wounded account for three-quarters, the vast majority of whom can return to the front line after recovery. This shows the great responsibility of health agencies.\"\n\nCommander Wang emphasized, after pointing out that some cadres and soldiers became disabled due to inadequate nursing and medical care: \"It must be remembered that wounded personnel are all experienced soldiers and cadres who have undergone combat training. For example, it takes several years of combat training and testing to develop a battalion commander into a backbone, which is a skilled talent gained by the entire army from combat at a great cost. This is the wealth of the revolution and the valuable capital of the people. I remember in 1938, Comrade Zuo Qi (Note: He was a regimental political commissar of the 359th Brigade when Commander Wang Zhen was the brigade commander) was wounded in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and his hand was disabled due to the tourniquet being tied for too long. International friend Dr. Bethune wrote to me, criticizing me, saying: 'The people's wealth that Chairman Mao entrusted to you is not machine guns and cannons, but cadres who have been trained in the 25,000-mile Long March. If your troops accidentally lose a few rifles or machine guns in combat, you will definitely investigate and punish them. But because the doctors in the unit did not fulfill their responsibilities and did not work well, which simply destroyed the cadres, you did not seriously investigate him.' Therefore, we must have a high degree of class friendship and responsibility for the wounded. Our necessary and possible material guarantees, medical care, and political work for them are still far from enough. This requires everyone to conduct reviews in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, overcome bureaucracy, and actively seek improvement.\"\n\nThen, he pointed out: \"Peacetime health care and hygiene campaigns are an important task that cannot be ignored in consolidating combat effectiveness. This task should be accomplished through garrison and marching hygiene, food security, the combination of health work and political work, and the combination of health education and management. Health agencies should regularly reflect the health status of soldiers. They should work with supply agencies to study soldiers' food based on regional seasons and physical consumption, pay attention to nutrition and save money.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 王震司令员勖勉卫生干部　改进卫生医疗工作  爱护伤病人员珍贵革命财富\n\n1948-09-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　王震司令员勖勉卫生干部\n  　改进卫生医疗工作\n    爱护伤病人员珍贵革命财富\n    【新华社西北十日电】王震司令员顷在某纵队卫生干部会议上讲话，对部队卫生工作的干部作了极大的鼓励。他盛赞人民解放军中的医疗卫生工作者艰苦奋斗自我牺牲和富于创造性等优良品质。他指出卫生工作是巩固部队、提高战斗力的极重要工作之一。他说：过去有些卫生工作人员没有认识到卫生工作的重要性，总以为卷崩带，端餐盘，擦碘酒，拿便器，没有意思，因此闹改行思想，这就是政治觉悟不够的表现。同时，由于领导上对于卫生机关的关心和重视非常不够，也影响了这一工作的改进。我们算一算非战斗减员和战斗减员的一般数字，就知道医务工作的好坏，关系军事任务的完成是如何的重大！军队中患疾病的叫做非战斗减员，或暂时失去战斗力。就某部说，现在住医院的占百分之二，加上门诊的就更多。因此，卫生机关工作的好坏，对于战斗力有极重要的意义。另外在战斗减员中，阵亡的大约占伤亡总数四分之一，负伤的占四分之三，其中绝大部分可以作到伤愈重返前线。这就说明了卫生机关责任的重大。\n    王司令员于指出一些干部和士兵由于护理和医疗工作的不周到因而残废后，强调地说：必须记住，负伤人员都是经过战斗锻炼的有经验的士兵和干部，如一个营长是要经过好几年的战斗锻炼和考验才成长起来的骨干，是全军从战斗中付出了重大代价换得的熟练人才，这是革命的财富，人民的宝贵资本。记得在一九三八年，左齐同志（按系王震司令员任三五九旅旅长时该旅的一位团政委）于抗日战争中负了伤，因扎止血带时间过久，手残废了。国际友人白求恩大夫写信给我，他批评我说：“毛主席交给你的人民财富不是机关枪和大炮，而是经过二万五千里长征锻炼的干部，如果你的部队作战偶一失掉几条步枪或机关枪，你一定会追究与惩罚他。但是因为部队的医生没有负到责任，工作得不好，简直是毁灭干部，你却不严重地追究他。”因此我们对伤员要有高度的阶级友爱和责任心。我们对他们的必需与可能的物质保证、医疗护理、政治工作等都还很不够，这须要大家以批评与自我批评的精神来进行检讨，克服官僚主义，积极求得改进。\n    接着他又指出：平时的保健工作与卫生运动是巩固战斗力不可忽视的一个重要工作。这个任务，要通过驻军与行军卫生，给养保证，卫生工作与政治工作相配合，卫生宣传教育与管理相配合来完成。卫生机关要经常反映战士健康情况。要与供给机关根据地区季节和体力消耗状况来研究战士食物，讲究营养和节省。"

    "content": "Organizing Women to Work in the Fields\n　　Taihang Area Balances Support for the Front and Production\n　　[Taihang News] Since the spring plowing and summer harvest, a large number of able-bodied men in Jinzhong and Jindong districts have participated in the war effort. Shouyang County sent out four groups of civilian laborers from June 29th to July 8th. In the third district alone, one group sent 813 people, accounting for two-fifths of the district's labor force. In Wuxiang County, the labor force participating in the war effort accounted for about 40% of the total labor force. This has led to an extreme shortage of labor in various places. The local leadership has paid attention to mobilizing and organizing the vast number of women to work in the fields, and has timely completed the huge tasks of supporting the front and production.\n　　Shouyang once put forward the slogan \"Men participate in the war in the front, women produce in the rear.\" Various districts and villages also held women's meetings to mobilize them, breaking the historical concept of Shouyang women not being able to endure hardship and loving beauty, and organizing themselves freely to produce. For example, the four textile groups of 22 women under the leadership of Liu Shuanni, chairman of the women's association in Beichang, were also the weeding group during weeding. According to statistics from the first district, there are 136 women in the district who regularly carry large hoes to the fields. Xima Palm Village in the district planted a total of 1,050 mu of corn, and women hoed more than 600 mu. Twenty-one villages in Wuxiang organized 1,360 women to harvest 43,176 mu of wheat, equivalent to 2,699 male laborers, and weeded 822.6 mu, equivalent to 418 male laborers.\n　　In mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, various places have gained a lot of experience: (1) First of all, it is necessary to improve their awareness and break the backward idea that women think labor is shameful. (2) Educate women that if they want to strive for equality between men and women, they must first participate in labor and achieve self-reliance. If they are capable and economically independent, their political status can be improved. Li Xiangyun, a woman from Duancun Village in Wuxiang, said: \"I used to think that equality between men and women just meant that men shouldn't beat you, and I still had no status at home. Since I started working in the fields this year, the family doesn't need to hire anyone, which saves food, and the men treat me better.\" (3) Resolve the confused thinking of women hero cadres and party members and make them actively play a leading role. (4) Solve the parasitic idea of ​​women being afraid of hardship and eating without working. In Beishanghe Village, Wuxiang, neither Han Futian's brothers are at home, only two women. Through this organization of women's labor, all the wheat in their family was harvested and all the seedlings were weeded. Shi Juying alone, in addition to pulling up 11 mu of seedlings and harvesting 5 mu of wheat in her family, earned 6 dou of wages. Now they are all happy to say: \"We used to just want to eat ready-made food and were looked down upon. Now it's good, we can do the same work as men.\" (5) Adhere to the principle of voluntariness, free grouping, and separate organization. Some young women and old uncles are very restrained together, and their production results are not great. In equal exchange, implementing work-based calculation and fair scoring can consolidate women's organizations. The Linxiang group in Duancun Village, Wuxiang, had fixed points, and later the women's production enthusiasm declined and they did not go to production. After changing and determining the standard points, and then implementing fixed points and flexible work, the women became energetic. (6) Regularly broadcast the victory news from the front to women, strengthen women's confidence in victory, and encourage production enthusiasm. (7) Break the wrong view of men underestimating women and thinking that women are useless. For example, when Duancun organized women, no one wanted them. The men reflected: \"It's nonsense to call women to the fields to work. Small feet make two holes in one step, and we have to fill them. They will trample the rice seedlings.\" The leadership explained with concrete facts. For example, the Duan Xiangyun group of seven women in the village harvested 70 mu of wheat a day, surpassing the men, and educated the whole village with their active work. Eighty-seven women were organized, and the original plan was to harvest wheat in six days, but it was completed in four days. The masses unanimously reflected: \"This year, women participated in labor, harvesting wheat and weeding seedlings, which is really a big deal!\"\n　　　　　　　　　　(Chen Tang, Liang Bei, Hai Wang, et al.)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 组织妇女下地劳动　太行各地支前生产两不误\n臣唐　良北　海旺等\n1948-09-13\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　组织妇女下地劳动\n  　太行各地支前生产两不误\n    【太行讯】晋中晋东区自春耕夏收以来，各县均有大批全劳力参战，寿阳从六月二十九日开始到七月八日先后出征民工四批，仅三区一个组就走了八一三人，占全区劳力五分之二，武乡全县参战走的劳力占所有劳力的百分之四十上下，造成了各地劳力极端缺乏，各地领导上注意发动与组织广大妇女下地劳动，适时完成了支前与生产的巨大任务。\n    寿阳曾提出“男人前方参战，女人后方生产”的口号，各区村并召开了妇女会议，进行动员，打破了寿阳妇女历史上不吃苦爱漂亮的观念，自由结合组织起来生产。如北昌妇女主席柳拴妮领导下的四个纺织组二十二人，锄苗时就是锄苗组。据一区统计，全区经常扛大锄上地的妇女有一三六人，该区吸马掌村共种一○五○亩玉茭，妇女就锄出六○○余亩。武乡二十一个村共组织一三六○个妇女，割麦子四三一七六亩，折合男劳力二六九九个，锄苗八二二·六亩，折合男人工四一八个。\n    在发动妇女参加农业生产上，各地获得了不少经验：（一）首先要提高她们觉悟，打破妇女认为劳动丢人的落后思想。（二）教育妇女要想争取男女平等，首先必须参加劳动，做到自力更生。自己有本事，经济上独立，政治地位才能提高。武乡段村妇女李相云说：“我以前认为男女平等，只是男人不打就算，自己在家里仍无地位，自今年上地参加劳动，家中不用雇人了，节省了粮食，男人才对我好了。”（三）解决妇女英雄干部党员的混乱思想，使其积极的起带头作用。（四）解决妇女怕吃苦，穿汉吃汉的寄生思想。武乡北上合村，韩福田弟兄二人都不在家，只有两个妇女，经这次组织妇女劳动，他家的麦子全部收割完，青苗全部锄完。史菊英一个人，除拔了她家十一亩青苗，割了五亩麦子外，就赚了工资米六斗，现在她们都高兴的说：“以前咱们光想吃现成，被人家看不起，现在可好了，男人们能做的活，咱们同样能做。”（五）要坚持自愿原则，自由结组，并单独组织为好。有些青年妇女和翁翁大伯在一块，很受拘束，生产成绩不大。在等价交换上执行以活计工，评分公道，才能巩固妇女组织。武乡段村林香组，订的死分，以后妇女生产情绪低落，不去生产，经过改变确定了标准分之后，再死分活干，妇女才起了劲。（六）给妇女经常广播前线胜利消息，坚定妇女胜利信心，鼓舞生产情绪。（七）打破男人轻视妇女认为妇女不顶事的错误观点。如段村把妇女组织起来没人要，男人们反映：“叫妇女上地做活扯蛋，大脚板还不要紧，小脚一步两圪洞，还得咱填哩，把谷苗都给踏坏了。”领导上拿具体事实，进行解释。如该村段香云组七个妇女，一天割麦七十个，赛过了男人，用她们活的事实，教育了全村。组织了八十七个妇女，割麦子原计划六天割完，四天即完成了，群众一致反映：“今年妇女参加劳动，又割麦又锄苗，真顶了大事！”\n  　　　　　　　　　　（臣唐、良北、海旺等）"

An article in the \"Observer\" magazine of Shanghai, Volume 4, Nos. 23 and 24, entitled \"China's Economy in the Past Seven Months,\" provides noteworthy figures on the economic situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the past six months or so. The article states that in the less than three years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, prices in the Kuomintang area have risen more than 14,000 times. The main reason for this price increase is inflation, and \"inflation has no possibility of reduction at all, so there is absolutely no hope of easing the economic crisis.\" Regarding the agricultural situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the article says: In agriculture, \"one mu of land must yield one shi of taxes, at the very least five or six dou. How can people survive when taxes exceed the harvest? In addition to the drought in Guangdong, Anhui, Henan and other provinces in the spring, the recent floods in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have affected 20 million people and caused a loss of 100 million dan of grain, exceeding 11% of the total national grain output last year.\" In industry, \"there are frequent reports of reduced production in the textile industry. According to a survey by the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association, factories have only 20 days of cotton in stock, so they have reduced work by 20%. More small and medium-sized textile mills have stopped production. The woolen textile industry only operates for 11 or 12 days a month, and the underwear industry has reduced production by one-third. The cigarette industry produced 175,000 boxes last December, but less than 100,000 boxes this June. 30% of the rubber industry has stopped production, and others are barely maintaining production with reduced output. Half of the match industry has shut down. 70% of steel manufacturers are in a state of semi-shutdown. In addition to the threat of Japanese goods recently poured into the Chinese market like crazy, industrial and commercial sales are sluggish, and there is no way out.\" \"The wealthy are fleeing abroad with large amounts of capital. Chinese deposits in Hong Kong and other places have reached 1.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (approximately 285 million US dollars). Those running factories are relocating their factories to the south.

From January to May this year, of the 180 or 190 newly registered factories, more than 60% were relocated from the mainland.\" Regarding the impact of the Sino-US bilateral agreement, the article states: \"US aid has brought 'bilateral agreements,' which is equivalent to abandoning the policy of protective tariffs, further colonizing China, and failing to solve the financial difficulties; while controls only promote the flight of capital to the south, block the transshipment of goods, fuel price increases, sacrifice small and medium-sized manufacturers, and concentrate wealth in the hands of a few people once again.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋区通货膨胀根本没有削减可能　三年来物价上涨万四千倍  农业税超过收成·工商业走头无路\n\n1948-09-13\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋区通货膨胀根本没有削减可能\n  　三年来物价上涨万四千倍\n    农业税超过收成·工商业走头无路\n    【新华社陕北十日电】上海“观察”杂志第四卷第二十三、四期所载“七个月来的中国经济”一文，对近半年多来国民党统治区的经济情况供给了可注意的数字。该文称抗战胜利后不满三年国民党区物价已上涨一万四千多倍，此种物价上涨的主要原因为通货膨胀，而“通货膨胀根本没有削减可能，从而经济危机也绝无缓和的希望”。该文在论及国民党统治区的农业状况时说：在农业方面，“一亩地要出一石捐税，最低也要五六斗，赋税超过了收成，怎叫人民活得下去？加上春间粤、皖、豫等省旱灾，最近粤、桂、闽、赣、鄂、湘、川、皖、苏九省的水灾，受灾人民达二千万，捐失粮食一万万担，总数超过去年全国粮食总产量百分之十一以上。”在工业方面，“纺织业减产之声时有所闻。上海棉纺公会调查，各厂只有二十天存棉，乃减工百分之二十，中小纺织业停工的更多。毛纺工业每月只开工十一、二天，内衣工业已减产三分之一；卷烟业去年十二月产十七万五千箱，今年六月不足十万箱；橡胶业停工三成，其他亦在减产勉强维持中；火柴业停业一半；钢铁工业有百分之七十厂家陷于半停工状态。加上最近疯狂投入中国市场的日货威胁，工商业实销清淡，走头无路。”“富豪们则将大量资金逃往国外，香港等地，华人存款即达十五亿港币（约合美金二亿八千五百万元）。办工业的人则将工厂南迁，去年香港新登记之工厂中有百分之二十是国内迁去，今年一月至五月新登记之工厂一百八、九十家，有百分之六十以上是国内南迁的。”关于中美双边协定的影响，该文称：“美援带来了‘双边协定’，等于放弃了保护关税政策，使中国更进一步殖民地化，解救不了财政困难；而管制只有促进资金南逃，阻塞商品转运，助长物价上涨，牺牲中小厂家，财富再度向少数人集中。”"

In the battle where the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated the Hu bandit 36th Division, a movement to kill the enemy, perform meritorious service, and join the Party, transfer Party membership, and strive to be a model Party member was launched. The Party Committee of the Second Battalion of a certain unit worked out specific methods for joining the Party at the front line, stipulating that victory news and heroic figures in the battle should be disseminated in a timely manner on the battlefield. Those who have demonstrated sufficient qualifications as a Party member in completing the most difficult combat tasks can have their application to join the Party accepted and be admitted into the Party. In three consecutive days of fighting, a certain unit admitted a large number of soldiers who had performed meritorious service into the Party, transferred Party membership, and elected model Party members. The Third Detachment of the Fourth Company re-elected its branch committee and rectified the branch and Party member groups within hours after the Wang Village battle. Party member Ma Shiren continued to fire steadily holding the gun body after his machine gun stock was shot off by the enemy in the battle, preventing the enemy from counterattacking, and was selected as a model Party member. Correspondents Zhou Daodi and Zhang Zhicai were approved to join the Party; the transfer of three probationary Party members was discussed and approved. The branch also posthumously recognized Li Xingzhong (probationary Party member), who heroically sacrificed in the battle, and Fu Hengxiang, a soldier who had requested to join the Party, as official Party members. Wang Changfa, a seventeen-year-old soldier from the Fifth Platoon, braved enemy artillery fire to climb onto the village, throwing grenades at the enemy, covering the whole platoon to climb up one after another, forcing fifty to sixty enemies to lay down their weapons and surrendering one heavy machine gun, two light machine guns, more than twenty rifles, and two pistols.

In the past, some comrades were not interested in agricultural and forestry work and felt that it was not a promising field. After studying, they settled down. In order to improve their professional knowledge and skills, the bureau's agricultural experiment group and the Zuoquan branch of the Second Special District Agricultural and Forestry Group, a total of 20 people, combined practical experience with academic studies to study the upcoming wheat planting issues on the 15th of last month, including the source and prevention methods of wheat diseases such as wheat smut and jaundice, as well as frost prevention, seed selection, autumn forest protection, and nursery techniques and practices. They are preparing to issue documents to local governments to uniformly deploy and guide the masses. Then, they went to the countryside in groups, to counties such as Licheng, Changzhi, Xiangyuan, Yushe, and Heshun, to carry out the following main tasks: 1. Organize and guide the masses to prevent and control wheat diseases and insect pests (jaundice, smut, black ear, etc.) to plant wheat well. Focus on selecting areas with serious smut, establish base points, provide specific guidance, and convene meetings of heroes, skilled farmers, village cadres, and technical committees to specifically study wheat disease prevention work, combining science with the practical experience of the masses. Organize specially invited farmers in Li (cheng) and Lu (cheng) and other places to conduct acclimatization experiments with improved wheat varieties. 2. Organize frost prevention. This year, thunder came early and frost will definitely come early. In severely affected areas, participate personally and organize the masses to prevent frost. 3. Organize seed selection to prepare for next year's large-scale production. Educate the masses to recognize that seed selection is an important method for increasing production and resisting diseases. If good varieties that can be promoted are discovered, select them locally and promote them locally. Organize the masses to conduct field seed selection by household or mutual aid group/team. 4. Summarize the \"August 11th\" millet and Golden Queen corn to determine future promotion policies. Conduct investigations and comparisons, pay attention to cost calculation, collect feedback from the masses, and be realistic and avoid subjectivism. 5. The key points of this autumn's tree planting and afforestation are mainly forest protection, especially large mountain forests. Organize the masses to protect them and prohibit random felling. In addition, pay attention to river forest protection and conduct autumn afforestation experiments on river滩. When conditions permit, mobilize the masses to collect tree seeds and conduct nursery sowing or replanting. 6. In order to further study soil pesticide insecticidal methods, three people were specially selected to go to the Qianwu Mountain area of Licheng to collect Chenopodium album and other soil medicines and absorb the masses' experience for experimentation.\n\n  　　　　　　(Taihang Changzhi Agricultural and Forestry Bureau Ma Lin, Li Min)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 加强种麦技术指导　长治农林局干部分头下乡\n马琳　利民\n1948-09-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　加强种麦技术指导\n  　长治农林局干部分头下乡\n    【太行讯】长治农林局干部经过学习，认识到今后发展农业生产及改良农具、选择优良品种、提高农业技术等的重要，大大提高了工作信心。个别同志过去对农林工作不感兴趣，觉得吃不开。经过学习后，也安心了。为了提高业务知识与技术，上月十五日该局农业试验组与二专农林组左权分场共廿人，以实际经验与学科结合研究了即将到来的种麦问题，包括麦子乌霉、黄疸等病状来源与防治方法，及防霜、选种、秋季护林、苗圃等技术与做法。准备印发文件给各地政府，统一布置指导群众。接着即分头下乡，分至黎城、长治、襄垣、榆社、和顺等县，进行以下主要工作：一、组织指导群众防治小麦病虫害（黄疸、乌霉、黑穗等），把麦种好。有重点的选择乌霉严重地区，建立基点，具体指导，并召开英雄能手村干技委会，专门研究小麦防病工作，以科学与群众实际经验结合进行。在黎、潞等地组织特约农家，作优种小麦风土试验。二、组织防霜。今年开雷早下霜一定早，在严重地区要亲自参加，组织群众防霜。三、组织选种，为明年大生产做好准备工作。教育群众认识选种是增产抗病的重要办法。发现有可推广的好品种，就地选，就地推广，组织群众以户或互助组、队为单位，进行田间选种。四、总结“八一一”谷与金皇后玉茭，以确定今后推广方针。调查比较，注意成本计算，搜集群众反映，态度要实事求是，克服主观主义。五、今秋植树造林重点，主要是林木保护，特别是大山林。组织群众保护，禁止乱砍伐。另外注意河林保护，并做河滩秋季造林试验。有条件时，可发动群众采集树籽，进行苗圃下种或补种。六、为进一步研究土药剂杀虫办法，专门抽出三人到黎城仟仵山一带采集藜蒌等土药，并吸收群众经验试验。\n  　　　　　　（太行长治农林局马琳、利民）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th—The Fangzi Public Coal Mine in Weifang City, Shandong Province, has actively improved its equipment, resulting in increased production in the three months since liberation, and saving a large amount of manpower. The daily output has now reached 467 tons, and the average daily output per person has increased by 3.3 tons compared to the enemy-occupied period last year. When mining began after the liberation of Fangzi, while mining coal in the mine, more than 50% of the labor force was used for opening coal mining tunnels, repairing old tunnels, replacing supports, adjusting air ducts, blocking areas with fire hazards, and establishing connecting roadways between various wells. This was a great waste of manpower. Now, the mine is vigorously improving equipment. The fifth well has broken through the dozens of meters of rock layer that could not be penetrated during the enemy occupation and has built 66 meters of railway, saving at least 60 man-days per day. The third well has solved the problem of ventilation regulation that could not be solved during the German, Japanese, and Chiang Kai-shek periods by installing a new electric winch and an electric fan. In addition, the mine is an old mine with many cracks in the ground wells. During the rainy season, large amounts of water seep into the strata, and the tunnels are easily flooded. Last year, work was suspended for half a year. This year, eight water pumps were added inside and outside the wells, and dikes and canals were built on the ground, so normal mining is possible during the rainy season. The water pool of the first well was silted up with mud and broken bricks and tiles to a depth of two feet. When the boiler pumped water, it often brought in mud, causing the boiler to rust two or three inches thick and consuming 20 tons of coal per day. After the workers thoroughly cleaned the pool and scrubbed the boiler, only 16 tons of coal were needed per day. In the past, after the coal was pulled out of the cage in the second well, it was dumped in the yard. After the company sold it, it was moved out of the yard basket by basket, which wasted a lot of manpower. Now, as a result of the improvement, the coal can be directly transported out of the yard after being pulled out of the cage, saving 40 man-days per day.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华东坊子公营煤矿改进设备产量增加\n\n1948-09-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　华东坊子公营煤矿改进设备产量增加\n    【新华社华东十一日电】潍坊市坊子公营煤矿，由于积极改进设备，解放后三个月来产量增加，且节省大批人力。现每日产量已达四六七吨，每人每日平均产量较去年敌占时增加百分之三点三吨。解放坊子后开始采煤时，井内一面采煤，一面则要以百分之五十以上的人工用于开辟采煤坑道、修整旧坑道、拆换支柱、调整风道、堵塞有火患危险地区、建立各井联系巷道等，人力浪费甚大。现在矿方大力改善设备，第五井将敌占时未能通过的十几米达的石层凿通，并增筑铁路六十六米，每日至少可节省六十个人工；第三井由于新装电绞车及电风车各一部，解决了在德人、日寇至蒋匪时期均未能解决的风气调剂问题。此外，该矿因系老矿，地面井眼裂痕很多，每逢雨季，大水渗入地层，坑道动辄被淹，去年即曾有半年未能工作，今年在井内及井口增设抽水机八部，并于地面筑堤修渠，故雨季仍能照常开采。一井的水池原被淤泥及碎砖乱瓦淤塞有二尺深，锅炉抽水时往往将泥带进，致使锅炉生锈有二三寸厚，每日费煤二十吨，经工人彻底清扫水池，洗刷锅炉后，每日只需煤十六吨即可。第二井过去把煤从灌笼里拉出来后，倒在场子里，公司卖好后，再一筐一筐的搬到场外，极浪费人力，现经改进结果，煤从灌笼拉出可直运场外，每日可节省人工四十个。"

    "content": "Inquiries and Answers\n\n　　North China Land Certificates Have Been Uniformly Issued\n    To the Editor:\n    Farmers are very eager to receive land certificates, but we have encountered two problems in our actual implementation that we cannot solve:\n    (1) There is an \"annual yield\" on the land certificate of Ping Shan County. The county and district instructed: \"The agricultural tax this year is basically based on the unified tax yield of last year. Individual unreasonable cases can be changed after review and discussion.\" However, the district also said: \"According to last year's yield, the actual production of land in Ping Shan Chengguan cannot reach that level.\" Herein lies the problem. If the land certificate is issued according to last year's tax yield, it is generally higher than the actual yield. If it is filled in according to the actual yield, the county and district instruct that it generally cannot be lowered this year. So, how should it be filled in reasonably? Based on the actual yield or based on the tax yield?\n    (2) According to my personal understanding, the land certificate should replace the old documents of the past, but the current land certificate actually cannot replace them. Because the \"plot\" and \"house type\" only have the number of mu, but no length and width, this reduces the importance the masses attach to the land certificate, and will cause many disputes in the future, and it will be even more troublesome to change it in the future.\n    The above two problems are hindering the issuance of land certificates. Please reply.\n    (Wang Junfeng, First District, Ping Shan)\n    Answer: Regarding the land certificate issue, we have requested the Border Region Government's Department of Civil Affairs to reply as follows:\n    After the merger of the two regions, when studying the formulation and issuance of unified North China land certificates, it was considered that the \"annual yield\" item was not easy to fill in appropriately and was also not important. Therefore, the newly issued North China Land and Property Ownership Certificate has cancelled this item and added the length and width item. The land certificate form issued by Jin-Cha-Ji last year originally did not have a length and width item, but had an annual yield item. If the old certificate form issued last year is still used, in order to avoid wasting labor and materials, the annual yield can be changed to fill in the length and width. If it is considered that the column is too narrow and inconvenient to fill in, the new certificate paper form can be changed to be used voluntarily by the masses. This new certificate and the filling method have been issued to governments at and above the county level by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee on August 9th with the order Min-She No. 9. – Editor.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 华北土地证已统一颁发\n王俊峰\n1948-09-14\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　华北土地证已统一颁发编辑同志：\n    农民对发土地证要求很迫切，但在我们实际执行当中，却遇到了两个问题不能解决：\n    （一）平山县土地证上有个“年产量”，县区指示：“今年纳农业税，基本上以去年的统税产量为标准。个别不合理者，经过审查讨论方可变动”。但区里又说：“按去年的产量，平山城关的地实际产不出来。”这里问题就来了。发土地证按去年纳税产量，一般高于实产量，按实产量填，县区又指示，今年一般的不能降。那么，究竟怎样填法合理呢？以实产量为根据还是以纳税产量为根据呢？\n    （二）根据我个人的了解，土地证要代替过去的旧文书，但按现在的土地证实际上代替不了。因为“地段”“房别”只有亩数，而没有弓口（即长横阔），这样，就减低了群众对土地证的重视，将来也会因此而发生好多纠纷，将来如再换更为麻烦。\n    以上两个问题，已阻碍着发土地证的进行，请答复。\n    （平山一区王俊峰）\n    答：关于土地证问题我们已请边府民政厅答复如下：\n    两区合并后，在研究制发华北统一土地证时，已认为年产量一项不易适当填写，且亦无关重要，故新发之华北土地房产所有证内已取消此项，并把长横阔一项增添上了。去年晋察冀所发之土地证式样，原无长横阔一项，而有年产量一项，如仍用去年所发旧证式样，为避浪费工料起见，可将年产量改为填写长辽阔，如嫌该栏狭窄不便填写，可根据群众自愿改用新发证纸式样填写。此项新证及填写办法，已由晋冀鲁豫边区政府及晋察冀边区行政委员会于八月九日以民社字第九号令发至县以上各级政府。——编者。"

In order to stabilize the countryside and increase production, all areas where land reform has been finally completed should promptly determine land rights, issue land certificates, and effectively protect the land and property of people of all classes after land reform from infringement in accordance with the law. We have prepared a sample of the \"Land and Property Ownership Certificate\" and a copy of the \"Filling Instructions,\" which are issued with this order. It is hoped that they will be quickly printed in imitation and issued in conjunction with the autumn harvest and autumn grain collection. For areas where land reform was thoroughly completed before the merger of the two border regions, and land certificates officially issued by the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government or the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee have already been issued, whether or not to reissue new certificates this time will be at the discretion of the holders of these certificates, and no one shall be forced to do so. Those who do not wish to exchange for new certificates, the previously issued land certificates shall remain legally valid. In areas where land reform has not yet been finally completed, local land replenishment and adjustment will still need to be implemented this winter and spring. Once it is completely completed, \"Land and Property Ownership Certificates\" should be issued in a timely manner to determine property rights.\n    Regarding the specific implementation measures for the issuance of \"Land and Property Ownership Certificates,\" various localities have some experience. It is hoped that they will be studied and improved to do this work well, and a summary report should be submitted after completion.\n    (Another dispatch) The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee issued a joint circular in mid-August, requiring governments at all levels to conduct land surveys and registrations in conjunction with the issuance of land certificates. During the registration, false reports, exaggerated reports, and concealed reports should be exposed as much as possible to ensure accuracy, but it is also important not to demand perfection in registration all at once, so as not to affect the issuance of land certificates. The standard mu is based on this year's agricultural tax method, with a normal annual yield of ten dou of grain per standard mu. The tax exemption point is calculated by deducting one standard mu per person. Livestock consumption is calculated at seven dou of grain for cattle and donkeys, and ten dou of grain for mules and horses. The standard mu after deducting the tax exemption point and consumption is the taxable mu.\n    　　(These announcements from the two border governments were issued on August 9th, and are specially re-printed here. - Editor)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 土地改革完成地区　颁发土地房产所有证\n\n1948-09-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　土地改革完成地区\n  　颁发土地房产所有证\n    【本报讯】前晋冀鲁豫边区政府、晋察冀边区行政委员会于八月九日联合发出“颁发土地房产所有证”的命令称：我华北解放区内大部地区，土地改革已经完成，为安定农村，提高生产，凡土地改革已最后完成的地区，应迅即确定地权，颁发土地证，并依法切实保障各阶层人民在土地改革后的土地财产不受侵犯。兹制就“土地房产所有证”式样及“填写办法”各一份，随令颁发，希即迅速依式仿印，结合秋收、秋征，颁发土地房产所有证。两边区未合并前土地改革已彻底完成地区，已经发过晋冀鲁豫边区政府或晋察冀边区行政委员会正式制发之土地证者，此次是否换发新证，悉听持有该项证件者之自愿，任何人不得强迫。不愿领换新证者，前发土地证在法律上同样有效。土地改革尚未最后完成的地区，在今冬明春尚须实行局部的土地抽补调剂，一俟彻底完成，即应及时颁发“土地房产所有证”，确定产权。\n    关于颁发“土地房产所有证”的具体执行办法，各地都有一些经验，务希加以研究改进，把这工作作好，并于完成后总结报告。\n    （又讯）晋冀鲁豫边区政府与晋察冀边区行政委员会于八月中旬发出联合通令，要求各级政府结合发土地证，进行土地调查登记。登记中要揭发假报、虚报、匿报，尽量做到真实，但也不能要求一下登记好，以免影响颁发土地证。标准亩系根据今年农业税办法，常年应产量十市斗谷为一标准亩，免税点按一人扣除一个标准亩，牲口消耗按牛、驴七市斗谷，骡、马十市斗谷为标准，扣除免税点及消耗后的标准亩，即为负担亩。\n    　　（两边府这一布告是八月九号发出，特补登于此。——编者）"

    "content": "【Beiyue News】The land certificate issuance work, eagerly anticipated by the masses, has been completed in Xin'an and Xizhuang villages in the first district of Pingshan. Before the land certificates were issued in these two villages, the masses generally felt that land ownership was not determined, and they were not at ease with production. The masses in Xizhuang said, \"The land doesn't even have a piece of paper to prove it, so we just plant it in a muddle. It doesn't matter if we don't apply fertilizer, we'll still get two seasons.\" They lacked the idea of becoming rich through production. Some people were also afraid that the land would be divided again this year. \"I heard that land reform will take two or three years to complete. Who knows if it will happen again this winter?\" Many people in Xin'an also said, \"Today you see that the land belongs to Wang, but who knows who it will belong to tomorrow?\"\n\nWhen the work of issuing land certificates began, various opportunities were used to explain that the purpose of issuing land certificates was to finally determine land ownership and develop production. Immediately, land boundaries and housing property were registered (the registration was not detailed during the distribution). Xizhuang Village established a review committee, divided into land and housing property groups, measurement groups, and accounting groups, responsible for reviewing, measuring, registering, and resolving housing and land disputes. The houses of landlords were also appropriately distributed to the five families who did not have houses. At the beginning of the registration work in the village, the village cadres were not enthusiastic, and no one spoke at the meetings. After individual conversations, it was discovered that the village had concealed black land. The village cadres were afraid of being punished and having to pay public grain if they were exposed. After repeated explanations that they would not be punished as long as they reported the truth now and corrected it later, and after mobilizing the masses, more than two *qing* of black land were found. After that, the village cadres became active. Xin'an Village first called on the masses to register land boundaries through the distribution committee, but only two households registered in two days. Later, it was changed to district-based supervision and inspection, with the masses finding someone to write the land boundaries and housing property drafts themselves. After writing, they were submitted to the distribution committee for review, and disputes were resolved every midday. Only then did the masses become active, and the drafts and registration were completed in three days. The land boundary disputes of eight families, the housing site problems of three families, and the family division issues of ten families were also resolved. Twenty families who secretly returned the distributed land to the original owners now regretted it and wanted to get the returned land back. After the distribution committee completed the review, ten calligraphers were hired to fill out the land certificates separately. When filling out the registration, the masses believed that this was a permanent proof and requested that it be written in regular script, and they did not like it to be smudged with black, so special care was required. Land certificates were issued collectively. When issuing, old contracts were to be returned. After the issuance, a mass meeting was convened to explain that land ownership had been finally determined and would not be changed again, and that everyone should be at ease with production. Finally, the old contracts were burned in public. At the land certificate issuance meeting in Xizhuang Village, the masses discussed the problem of Liu Shuangkui, a loafer who ate and drank lavishly, liked to gamble, and did not work hard in production, and decided not to issue him a land certificate for the time being, and to issue it after he had truly reformed. After the land certificates were issued, the masses felt that the land was truly their own, and they cherished the land certificates very much. When a farmer in Xizhuang saw a member of the work team, he asked him to read his land certificate for him, fearing that it was written incorrectly. After receiving the land certificates, everyone carefully folded them and kept them safe. From then on, the \"stone in the hearts\" of the masses was put down. Yu Lianrong, an old man in Xizhuang, said, \"This time it's insured. The family property and land are all in hand. We must produce well in the future!\" (Fourth Branch)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 家产地业都到手　放心生产闹发家　平山一区新安、西庄发了土地证\n\n1948-09-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　家产地业都到手\n  　放心生产闹发家\n  　平山一区新安、西庄发了土地证\n    【北岳讯】平山一区新安、西庄两村，群众热望的土地证颁发工作业已完成。该两村土地证颁发前，群众普遍觉得地权未确定，生产不安心，西庄群众说：“地连个凭据也没有，稀里糊涂种上算了，不上粪也闹两季”，缺乏生产致富思想。也有的人怕今年还平分，“听说土改两三年才完成，谁知道今年冬天还闹不闹？”新安不少群众也说：“今天你看着那地姓王，明天谁知道它姓什么？”\n    发土地证工作开始时，先利用各种机会，说明发土地证为了最后确定地权，发展生产。随即进行土地四至，与房产的登记，（平分时登记得不详细）西庄村成立了审查委员会，分为地亩房产组，丈量组、会计组，负责审查、丈量、登记与解决房地纠纷，五家没房产的也将地主房屋适当分给他们一部。该村登记工作之初，村干不起劲，开会谁也不发言。经过个别谈话，发现该村瞒有黑地，村干怕暴露了受处分，赔公粮，经过再三说明只要现在实报以后改正，就不处分，又向群众进行了动员，结果查出黑地两顷多，此后村干就积极起来。新安村先由平分委员会号召群众登记土地四至，但两天来登记者只有两户，后改为分片督促检查，由群众自己找人代写土地四至，房产草底，写好后交平分委员会审查，每日晌午解决纠纷，这群众刚才积极起来，三天草底、登记即告完成，还解决了八家的地界争执问题，三家房址问题，十家分家的。二十家暗自将分得土地退回原主的现在又后悔了，也将退回土地要回。分委会审查完毕，聘请了十个掌笔先生，分别填写土地证。在填写登记时，群众认为这是永久的凭据，要求写正楷，不喜欢涂抹得一片片黑，因而需要特别细心。发土地证采取集体发的方式，发时要交回旧文契，发完即召开了群众大会，说明地权已最后确定再不变更，大家要安心生产，最后当众将旧文契烧毁。西庄村在发土地证会上，由群众讨论了胡吃乱喝、好耍钱、不努力生产的二流子刘双魁的问题，决定暂不发给土地证，等他真正转变后再发。土地证颁发后，群众觉得土地真是自己的了，对土地证非常爱惜。西庄一个农民一见到工作组同志，就叫给他念土地证，恐怕写错了，领到土地证后大家都把它好好折叠包藏起来。从此，群众“心里的石头放下了”，西庄老汉于连荣说：“这回可保险了，家产地业都到手了，以后可得好好生产哩！”（四支社）"

    "content": "Pingding Rural Areas\n  　Gambling and Theft Rampant\n  　Leadership Should Resolutely Stop These Activities\n    In the past six months, many villages in Pingding have seen gambling, theft, shamanistic activities, and even the construction of temples and the sculpting of idols. Recently, during our visit to the countryside, we heard that the above phenomena have become even more serious, especially gambling, which is developing universally. In Shajing, people gather to gamble and even organize lookouts. It is said that the gamblers are also preparing wooden and stone weapons, and if a few cadres try to catch them, they will resist with force. Wei Liancheng of Dongzhuangtou Village used a loan of 50,000 yuan for gambling. The temple construction and idol sculpting in Ciciyao Village of the county were later forced to stop due to difficulties in raising funds.\n    Theft has also occurred in many areas. Yang Sanmao of Dongzhuangtou Village had a total of four dou of wheat harvested this year, all of which were stolen. Hu Jilian, Hu Jinniu, and Guo Hucheng of Jiaokou Village are all young and strong men, but they do not cultivate their own land. Instead, they hire others to cultivate half of it. The three of them form a small group and wander around all day, eating and gambling heavily. When they have no money, they find ways to steal. Once, they stole someone else's donkey and were discovered and fled. Hu Jicheng broke his leg while stealing and was caught by the masses. According to Hu Jicheng's own confession, he stole a total of six dou of millet and corn from poor peasant Hu Ming, two dou of grain from Hu Yuanxiao, and a donkey from middle peasant Hu Zhengliang, all of which were squandered. The stolen donkey was sold in Yangquan for 160,000 yuan and completely lost in gambling. In April of this year, two middle peasant households and two poor peasant households lost more than one shi of wheat in total.\n    In addition, the old operas performed in Mukou and Luomianzui, the welcoming of gods and temple fairs in Lijiazhuang, and the praying for rain in many villages such as Heizhang and Yangpo in mid-July are not good. Moreover, when Haojiazhuang performed the old opera, the district cadres went to explain and stop it, but were beaten by a group of hoodlums (the perpetrators have been detained by the government). This fully demonstrates a state of anarchy, lack of leadership, and extreme democracy. Although the county's democratic government has issued several announcements to stop these activities, they have not been earnestly implemented in the villages, and those rogue ruffians are still extremely rampant. (Editor's note: Thugs and troublemakers should be punished. Performing old operas and welcoming gods and temple fairs are not good, and the masses should be persuaded through education, but forced prohibition should never be adopted.)\n    Why does this phenomenon occur in some old areas of Pingding County? (1) Leftist deviations during the land reform. (2) Tailism in leadership during the land reform period. (3) Many new cadres lack work experience and are afraid to deal with problems boldly. Under the above conditions, bad people take the opportunity to act and attempt to disrupt the revolutionary social order.\n    It is hoped that the Pingding County Government will immediately conduct a good inspection and make appropriate corrections. The backward peasants who follow suit should be enlightened and educated to raise their awareness and not follow bad people, as this will not benefit them. The government should resolutely stop the activities of those who are willing to be bare-handed rogues, do not work, do not engage in proper business, and ruin their families and properties after repeated education, and should force them to participate in labor and impose necessary punishments. Otherwise, it will have a great impact on the future social order, the production of the masses, and the overcoming of famine.

    "content": "The Blockade at Dunfang\n\n　　On July 7th, we knocked out six of the enemy's vehicles. As dusk fell, the Third Battalion of the ×× Unit arrived at Dunfang Village, and a small enemy force had also slipped through here. The sky was heavily overcast, and despite searching until nearly dawn, nothing was discovered. The soldiers were exhausted from marching and fighting, and the fortifications were not well-prepared. By the time it was fully light, the enemy's scouts were already at the edge of our position. The Seventh Company had just returned from outside the village to build fortifications when the enemy's scouts were already at the edge of our position. We captured the two scouts alive, suppressed them with fire, drove them back a bit, and defeated the enemy.\n\n　　However, ten minutes later, the enemy organized its firepower, and four artillery groups launched a fierce attack on our position, first hammering away at the Ninth Company's position to our due south for quite a while, but unable to break through. Then, they turned to attack the Eighth Company to the southeast.\n\n　　The Eighth Company's position was a hundred meters or so from the village, built in a small east-west ditch, with a small bridge consisting of three large stone slabs in the middle. The soldiers' individual foxholes were dug on the west side of the bridge, and the ditch was very shallow. Crawling forward, it was easy to expose oneself. Fifty or sixty meters east of the bridge, there was a large bend turning southwest. The enemy moved along the ditch to that point, and a platoon or more of troops rushed to within only thirty or forty meters of them without any regard for formation. The Eighth Squad Leader shot down an enemy company commander holding binoculars and a red flag with a burst of machine-gun fire. Immediately, a platoon leader picked up his red flag and continued to charge, but the soldiers threw a volley of grenades and shot him down as well. When the third man picked up the red flag, he was also shot down. Only then did we drive the enemy back.\n\n　　The second time, the enemy moved up from the trenches again, no longer daring to be ostentatious or disregard formation, but instead adopted small-group tactics. The soldiers could only see their helmets and bayonets. After firing two bursts of machine-gun fire, the Eighth Company drove the enemy back again. At this time, airplanes came and strafed several times. The company commander had already been killed, and orders came from the rear to appoint the Second Platoon Leader as acting deputy company commander. However, there were only fourteen or fifteen people left at the front. The Second Platoon Leader was afraid that the small number of people would result in the loss of the position, so he had already sent three people down to make contact. At this time, there was still no news. He immediately appointed the First Squad Leader as acting platoon leader and personally went to contact the instructor, hoping to bring up a few more people. However, the artillery fire and airplane strafing were so fierce that the three people he sent were all killed or wounded, and the instructor had already been killed. He himself had only crawled a few steps before he was hit and killed.\n\n　　The Second Squad Leader took over as platoon leader, but soon after, he was shot and killed by an enemy sniper. At this time, the soldiers were not panicked. They said very solemnly to the deputy squad leader: \"The cadres have all been killed. You are the only deputy squad leader left. You are responsible for commanding us!\" Li Junxiang immediately agreed: \"I am responsible for command.\" And he said to everyone:\n\n　　\"There are only ten of us left. Let's learn from Li Haisui!\"\n\n　　Everyone silently listened to his words and put forward a common slogan: \"We are here, the position is here, and we will never lose the position.\" Li Junxiang divided the six rifles into three groups: Zhang Zhongyuan and a liberated soldier were north of the bridge, Guo Zhenyi and Wang Laohu were south of the bridge, and Cai Laibao and Zuo Baoxiao were in the middle. Each group was responsible for one direction, monitoring the enemy. The machine gun was placed on the rear side, and all the magazines were filled to the brim. They would only fire when a large number of enemies charged up. They were only allowed to use snipers against a small number of enemies, and not to use machine guns, in order to conserve ammunition. They also took all the grenades from the dead and wounded comrades, unscrewed the caps of each grenade, pulled out the fuses, and waited for the enemy.\n\n　　Having suffered twice, the enemy dared not advance rashly. Several small attacks were repelled by them, but the enemy's artillery fire was still very fierce. Wang Haicheng's hat was swept away by a bullet, and the accumulated soil on the individual foxholes was all pushed away by heavy machine guns. Ten or so heavy mortar shells were fired in a volley, and Zhang Zhongyuan was buried by the soil, but he crawled out again. Airplanes came and strafed straight along the ditch twice. A willow branch on the side of the ditch was broken off, and the leaves were all swept away. Holes were punched in everyone's backpacks. However, these ten people still persevered without wavering.\n\n　　The battle was silent for a moment. The enemy was still moving forward. On the flank of the neighboring position, a blaze of light rose up. The enemy's clothes were on fire, and they fled in panic. Li Junxiang saw it and immediately told everyone: \"Isn't that the × Column? They've outflanked the enemy. Look! They're firing incendiary bombs.\" The soldiers all knew that the incendiary bombs were what we captured at Linfen. The Yan bandit army didn't have that stuff, so the soldiers were happy. The × Column, which had captured Qixian, had also caught up. The enemy was surrounded on all sides.\n\n　　Soon after, the superiors sent a simple map of the enemy's encirclement to the front line. The soldiers looked at the map and fought with more energy.\n\n　　Before dusk, the Fifth Company had added a dozen more people. The enemy's attack on the Seventh Company's position to the due east had also failed to move them. The bugle sounded the charge. Li Junxiang said: \"Look, it's the same old trick again. The enemy is going to retreat.\" Sure enough, after firing a few volleys of artillery at our position, the enemy retreated. This retreat tightened the encirclement, and they could no longer stretch out. They could neither break through nor run away.\n\n　　The blockade at Dunfang Village was still very fierce. The enemy was a division, while we had only a battalion defending the position. The enemy had four artillery groups, at least twenty cannons. Our telephone line, less than three hundred meters long, was broken twenty times by the enemy's artillery fire. But what use was that? Our rifles turned red, and when the machine gunners moved their positions, they hugged the gun barrels and burned their faces. But the enemy was stopped, and the enemy's doomsday was also coming.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Geng Xi\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 敦坊阻击战\n耿西\n1948-09-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　敦坊阻击战\n    七月七号，我们打倒了敌人的六辆汽车。天擦黑的时候，××部队三营走到敦坊村，敌人的一个小部队，也从这里插过去了。天阴得厉害，搜索到天快亮了，也没有发觉什么，战士们行军中又打了仗，累得很，工事没做好，天已经大亮了。七连刚从村外收回来做工事，敌人的尖兵已经到了我们阵地边边上了。我们活捉了那两个尖兵，一阵火力压下去，撵了一节，把敌人打敌了。\n    但是，十分钟以后，敌人组织了火力，四个炮兵群向我阵地猛烈攻击，先向我们正南九连的阵地啃了半天，啃不动，又转到东南啃八连了。\n　八连的阵地离村还有百多米达，是在一条由东向西的小渠里修的，中间有一条三块大石板构成的小桥。战士们的单人掩体，都挖在桥西边，而渠是很浅的，匍匐前进，稍不注意便暴露了目标。桥东面，五六十米达远的地方，有一个转向西南的大拐弯，敌人顺着水渠运动到那里了，一个多排的兵力，不讲究任何队形的冲到离他们只三四十米达了，八班长一梭机枪打倒了一个挂着望远镜，手拿红旗的敌连长，马上一个排长又拿起他的红旗继续冲，战士们一排手榴弹打过去，又把他打倒了，第三个才拿起那个红旗来时，又被我们打倒了，这样才把敌人打下去。\n    第二次，敌人又从壕沟里运动上来，再不敢大模大样，不讲究队形，而是采用小组动作了。战士们只能看见他们的钢盔和刺刀，八连机枪打两梭子弹后，又把敌人打退了。这时候，飞机来扫射了几次，连长已经牺牲了，后面传命令来指定二排长代理副连长，前面却只剩下了十四五个人，二排长害怕人少会丢阵地，早就连派三个人下去连络了。此时仍不见音信，他马上指定了一班长代理排长，亲自找指导员连络去，想增加几个人上来。但是，炮火与飞机扫射是那样的猛烈，他派去的三个人都牺牲挂彩了，指导员也早已牺牲了，他自己刚爬了几步，也中弹牺牲了。\n    二班长代理了排长，不一会，又被敌人冷枪打着牺牲了，这时候，战士们并不惊慌，他们很沉痛的对副班长说：“干部们都牺牲了，就剩下你一个副班长了，你负责指挥我们吧！”李俊祥马上答应：我负责指挥。并向大家说：\n    “就剩下我们这十来个人了，我们学习李海水吧！”\n    大家都默默的听着他的话，提出了共同的口号：人在阵地在，决不丢阵地。李俊祥把六支步枪分了三个组，张忠元和一个解放战士在桥北，郭振义王老虎在桥南，蔡来保和左保小在中间，每组负责一个方向，监视敌人。机枪放在后侧，把所有的梭子都压满，等大批的敌人冲来再打，少数敌人上来只准用冷枪打，不准用机枪，好节省弹药，又把所有牺牲挂彩同志的手榴弹拿来，把每颗手榴弹的盖子拧开，把火线都拉出来，等待着敌人。\n    敌人吃了两次亏，也不敢冒然前进了，一连几次的小进攻都被他们打退了，但敌人的炮火仍旧是非常猛烈的，王海成的帽子，叫子弹扫掉了，单人掩体上的积土都被重机枪推光了，十来发重炮迫击炮齐排射过来，张忠元被土埋住了又爬出来，飞机来顺着水渠直扫了两次，水渠边的一棵柳树枝子打断了，叶子都扫光了，战士们每个人的背包上都打穿了窟窿。但是，这十个人仍旧毫不动摇的坚持着。\n    战斗沉寂了片刻，敌人仍向前运动，在侧面友邻阵地上，冒起了一片光，敌人的衣服烧着了，狼狈的逃窜，李俊祥看见了，马上告给大家：“这不是×纵队？他们抄到敌人侧翼了。看！他们打燃烧弹了。”战士们都知道燃烧弹是我们打临汾得来的，阎匪军没有那家伙，于是，战士们高兴了。×纵队攻下祁县也赶上来了，敌人已在我们四面的包围之中。\n    不久，上级把敌人被围的形势简图传到了火线，战士们看着地图，越打越有劲了。\n    黄昏以前，五连又增加上十几个人来，敌人攻正东七连的阵地也未攻动，吹起冲锋号来了，李俊祥说：“看又是那老一套，敌人要退了。”果然不一会，敌人猛烈的向我们阵地上打了几排炮后，便缩回去了。这一缩使它被包围得紧紧的，再也不能伸展了，突也突不出，跑也跑不动。\n    敦坊村的阻击战，还是激烈得很的，敌人是一个师，而我们守阵地的却只一个营，敌人四个炮兵群，起码有二十门大炮，我们一条不到三百米长的电话线，竟在敌人排炮之中被打断了二十次，但那有什么用处呢？我们的步枪打红了，机枪射手转移阵地时，抱着枪筒，把脸都给烧坏了。但敌人却被阻止住了，敌人的末日，也跟着就来了。　　　　　\n　　　耿西"

Before the training, the Third Company received a batch of newly liberated soldiers. In order to ensure the training yielded tangible results and to dispel the liberated soldiers' doubts about demolition, after discussion, it was decided to adopt a realistic simulation approach, reviewing as they practiced, and fully promoting military democracy, encouraging everyone to offer ideas and solutions. When Companies One and Three were training, they utilized natural terrain and objects, treating the simulations as real. Company One used a wheat stack as the core fortification, a pile of earth in front of the stack as a bunker, a pit on the side as a hidden bunker, surrounded by a shallow ditch less than three feet deep. When Company Seven practiced, they even set up chevaux de frise. After each squad practiced, the entire company would collectively review. On the first day of Company One's practice, some comrades were not serious enough, lacked awareness of the enemy situation, and moved slowly. They were criticized at the review meeting. Liberated soldier Wang Yonglai was praised at the meeting for his quick movements and low profile. When Company Three first started, some new comrades showed fear. After repeated explanations by everyone, their doubts were dispelled. Some people felt it was troublesome and didn't put in the effort, so a group of people was sent to the fortifications to act as hypothetical enemies. This way, while defending and attacking, combining the situation of mine demolition, everyone would discuss and solve problems at any time. In Company Two, veteran soldiers would first demonstrate so that new soldiers could watch. If there was anything they didn't understand, they could ask questions and get answers immediately. Only after they understood would the new soldiers be asked to practice. Finally, veteran and new soldiers would work together, reviewing after each practice. Some even had new soldiers lead as squad leaders in the final stage, giving everyone the opportunity to practice. In the few days of training, the newly arrived soldiers made significant progress in terms of both understanding and technique. Liberated soldier Yu Baotai from the Third Squad said, \"In the past, I didn't know what demolition or flying mines were. After these few days of learning, I not only know what they are, but I can also use them.\" Shen Zhiming from the Ninth Squad said, \"I also know the structure and power of the mines now.\" Finally, at the demolition learning summary meeting of the entire regiment, an actual demolition drill was conducted, dispelling the doubts and fears of individual comrades.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 某部三连演习爆破　以假比真边演边学\n\n1948-09-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　某部三连演习爆破\n  　以假比真边演边学\n    【冀中七日电】冀中地方兵团某部三连于练兵运动中，对于爆破学习，采取了以假比真、边演边学、边演边改进的方法，收效不小。练兵前，三边接受了一批解放战士，为了使练兵收到切实的成绩和打破解放战士对爆破的怀疑心理，经过大家研究，决定采取以假比真的办法，边演边检讨，充分发扬军事民主，让大伙出主意想办法。该连一、三排学习时利用自然地形地物，以假当真，一排利用麦秸垛当核心工事，以垛前的一堆土当地堡，一边的一个坑当暗堡，周围并有深不满三尺的一道小沟。七排作的时候，还特别设置了拒马。一个班作一次后，全排就集体检讨一次。一排头一天作的时候，有的同志态度不严肃，没敌情观念，动作迟缓，检讨会上都受到了批评。解放战士王永来动作快，姿势低，会上及时的表扬了他。三排刚作的时候，有的新同志表现害怕，经过大伙反复讲解，才打消了怀疑，有些人感觉麻烦，不上劲，于是又派一班人到工事里当假设敌。这样一边防御，一边攻击，结合地雷爆破情况随时变，大家就随时讨论解决。二排是老战士先作个样子，让新战士看，不明白的随问随答，都明白了，才叫新战士作，最后新老战士结合在一起作，作一次检讨一次，还有的在最后让新战士当小组长带着作，让大家都有演习的机会。新来的战士在几天的练兵中，不论从认识上、技术上，进步都不小。三班解放战士余保太说：“过去我不知道什么是爆破、飞雷，经过这几天的学习，我不但知道了，而且也会用了。”九班的沈志明说：“我也知道雷的构造和它的威力了。”最后全团在总结爆破学习大会上，又作了实际爆破的演习，把个别同志怀疑恐惧的心理打消了。"

    "content": "(From the Ping-Bao Front) A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in North China held a large-scale sand table review after the Ping-Bao Campaign. On the large threshing ground in the village, a model of the south city wall of Xushui was built, more than three zhang long. All the large bunkers, pillboxes, obstacles, ditches, bridges, and various gun emplacements were made according to the original. Each participating unit reported its pre-war preparations, the situation encountered during combat, and how it was handled. They also used the sand table to compare and explain, and finally everyone commented and found the meritorious units. Yan Shiping, the second platoon leader of the first company of a certain unit, reported the meticulous organization and preparation of the second platoon before the general attack: compiling numbers, repeated drills, using sorghum stalks to make chevaux-de-frise, and using small sticks to tie explosives for testing. Before departure, when checking confidence, it was discovered that comrades responsible for the sneak attack and blasting raised concerns: the moon made it easy to be spotted by the enemy, the accumulated water made noise when walking, etc. The cadres explained these concerns one by one to dispel them. At the start of the battle, he described how he blasted away three layers of obstacles such as wooden fences and chevaux-de-frise, and how he blasted a section of the city wall during the general attack, opening a path for the troops to charge. The city-climbing action was reported by Feng Yunhui, the third platoon leader of the company, on the three sets of experiences in organizing the attack and the ladder-climbing methods studied before the war. He said: At the beginning of the attack, after the tenth squad was injured by enemy flanking fire, the second and eleventh squads quickly took over. Before the ladder was set up, Deputy Company Commander Zhang Fuzhen and soldier Guo Baotai tried to climb up the city wall first. At this time, Guo Baotai himself reported how he climbed the city, how he went to the enemy's large bunker, and how he repelled two enemy counter-attacks by himself, protecting the troops to continue climbing the city. After the report, everyone commented, supplemented, and put forward different opinions. Finally, it was unanimously decided that the second platoon of the first company had made great contributions and should be awarded a great merit, and Zhang Fuzhen and Guo Baotai, who were the first to climb the city, should also be awarded great merits. Then, the responsibility for failing to complete the task was investigated. Everyone believed that after the third company climbed the city, it did not quickly go down the city and develop in depth. Deputy Company Commander Shi Jianxin said, \"The city wall is more than one zhang high, and I was afraid of falling and breaking it, so I started digging the city wall.\" Squad Leader Wang Yiheng said, \"The deputy company commander said he loved the soldiers and was afraid of them falling and breaking, which is not right. This is not loving the soldiers, this is failing to complete the task!\" Some said, \"The wall is very thick, and it took more than an hour to dig through it, but in the end they still jumped down, and no one was injured. It was just that he was afraid of death! He was not actively developing, and should be held responsible!\" A platoon leader said, \"After Company Commander Ma Qingshan was wounded, he should have replaced the company commander in commanding the troops, and should not have only commanded the firepower team. The battalion commander ordered him to go up, but he did not go, and he should also be held responsible!\" It was proposed that these comrades should be subject to disciplinary action. Such a sand table review concretely carried out the democratic comparison and evaluation movement of the troops, so that the commanders and fighters who were brave and resourceful in the battle were rewarded, and the commanders and fighters who did not complete the task accepted the lesson.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 某部开展民主比评运动　筑成模型检讨战斗\n\n1948-09-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　某部开展民主比评运动\n  　筑成模型检讨战斗\n    【平保前线讯】华北人民解放军某部于平保战役后，举行大沙盘检讨。在驻村的沙堆大场上，筑成徐水南城墙模型，全长三丈多，凡当地所有大碉、地堡、障碍、沟壕、桥、各种枪眼都按原样制好。由各参战部队报告自己的战前准备，战斗中遇到的情况，和怎样处理的。并在沙盘上来回比方、说明，最后大家评论，找出有功部队。某部一连二排长阎式平，报告二排总攻前的严密组织和准备：编成号码，反复演习，用秫秸做拒马，用小棍绑炸药试验，在出发前，检查信心时，发现担任偷袭爆破的同志提出：有月亮容易被敌人发觉，有积水走路就响等等顾虑，干部就一一解释，解除这些顾虑。战斗开始时，又怎样爆破扫清木栅、拒马等三层障碍，总攻时怎样炸坏一块城墙，给部队打开了一道冲锋道路。登城动作由该连三排长冯运会报告攻城组织的三套经验及战前研究的架梯登城办法。他说：攻城开始时，十班上去受敌侧射火力杀伤后，二、十一等班就迅速接上去，梯子还没有架好，副连长张福振和战士郭保泰就想法从城墙上爬上去首先登城。这时就由郭保泰自己报告怎样登的城，怎样走到敌人大碉边，一个人打退了敌人两次反冲锋，保护部队继续登城。报告完了以后，大家评论补充和提出不同的意见，最后一致选出一连二排功劳大该立大功，先登城的张福振、郭保泰也立大功。接着就追究没有完成任务的责任。大家认为：三连登城以后，没有很快下城向纵深发展，副连长石建新说：“一丈多高的城墙，恐怕跳下去摔坏了，就挖起城墙来。”班长王义恒说：“副连长是说爱兵怕摔坏，这不对。这不是爱兵，是没有完成任务！”有的说：“墙很厚，挖一点多钟也挖不透，最后还是跳下去，也没有摔坏人，就是他怕死！不积极发展，应负责任！”一个排长说：“指导员马庆山同志在连长负伤以后，应代替连长指挥部队，不应光指挥火力队，营长命他上去，他也不去，同样要负责任！”提出这些同志应受纪律处分。这样的沙盘检讨具体的开展了部队的民主比评运动，使在战斗中有勇敢有智谋的指战员受到了奖励，使没有完成任务的指战员接受了教训。"

After Sui County was recovered again in early June, merchants who had left have returned one after another to resume business. Currently, the city's merchant ships are traveling frequently, business is booming, and prices have generally fallen. Firewood and salt prices have more than halved. Grain stores sell more than 500 *shi* of grain daily. After Zhongxiang was recovered for the second time, Zheng Shaowen, the director of the administrative office, personally went to guide the city's restoration work in early July and held forums with representatives from business, education, and medicine, with more than 200 representatives attending. After Director Zheng announced the democratic government's policy of earnestly protecting industry and commerce, he explained that in this war environment, *bao-jia* personnel must continue to work but must faithfully obey and execute the laws of the democratic government, maintain public order, and not engage in undermining sabotage. The representatives expressed their support. The city market has gradually returned to normal. Industry and commerce in Tianmen, Yuekou, and the towns of Xingouzu and Fengkou on the south bank of the Han River have also recovered and have seen considerable development. Xingouzu originally had 535 industrial and commercial establishments. Eleven relocated and 41 closed down before and after liberation. From the second half of April to the beginning of June, 63 new flour mills, egg shops, machine-made noodle factories, mills, and trading firms were opened, as well as a new theater, bringing the total to 547, an increase of 12 compared to before liberation. The democratic government has fully investigated, returned, or compensated industrial and commercial establishments in the city that were wrongly handled when it was first liberated. Landlord Xiao Mingzhen, after taking back his oil press, has officially resumed business and is striving to expand his operations. The industry and commerce in Fengkou Town has increased from 40 to 109, with another 15 preparing to open.

    "content": "[Ji Zhong Electric] Hejian City has seen a gradual development of its industry and commerce since it corrected its industrial and commercial policies, rectified errors that infringed upon industry and commerce, and the government and banks have provided greater support to industry and commerce. According to statistics from January, excluding vendors, the city had a total of 242 industrial and commercial households; by the end of July, this had increased to 341 households, an increase of 99 households. Among the newly added households, industry accounted for 62%. In terms of the textile industry: the city had no foundation in the past, but with the support of the government, according to statistics from August, the number of weaving households has increased from 10 in January to 24, driving a number of women to engage in weaving. The mass factory alone has driven 480 households. The quality of products is also improving day by day. For example, the striped and patterned earth cloth woven by mass and Xin Sheng factories, and the socks woven by Guangfa and Yihua are very strong and sell well in nearby counties. Recently, in order to solve the problem of cooked cotton for textile households, the electric light company has researched and developed the use of electricity to drive six cotton gins, which can produce 500 kilograms of cooked cotton per day. One has already been installed, and others are being installed. In terms of the iron industry: in addition to the 12 blacksmith furnaces that regularly manufacture agricultural tools, there are also 8 iron factories. The front, rear, and middle axles and axle blocks produced by Zhenzhong, Zhenxing, and Dazhong are of good quality and are sold in Shijiazhuang, Southern Hebei, and other places. Dazhong has also created a casting machine. The iron pots cast by a certain iron factory are often not enough to sell. They are now vigorously manufacturing waterwheels and other agricultural tools. In terms of wood product manufacturing: there are already 8 wood factories, mainly manufacturing large carts, waterwheels, looms, agricultural tools, and sideline tools. For example, Xinghe Wood Factory manufactured 22 large carts, 75 small carts, repaired 75 large carts, and 2 looms in half a year, and also created a light hoe (which can replace the plow, saving animal power). In terms of the chemical industry: there are currently 3 soap factories, etc. Manager Ma of the mass factory has also researched and developed the use of local alkali to boil caustic soda, which can replace foreign alkali, and has been successfully tested. Wanyou Factory earned a net profit of 619,000 yuan in seven months. Yuhua Factory has been able to manufacture its own ink, ink sticks, ink, etc. Chexin Pharmacy has begun to self-produce Dawang Oil, Ten Drops Water, Rendan, and Plague Prevention Powder. Minsheng Firecracker Factory has also successfully tested the manufacture of firecrackers. The shoe industry had developed to 60 households and 700 workers, driving 2,500 people (mostly women) by the time of the wheat harvest. From April 20th to June 10th, 14,379 pairs of shoes were produced in 50 days. Since the rectification of the village, the quality of shoes has been greatly improved. In terms of commerce: because the city is located in the center of central Hebei, most goods are concentrated in the city and then transferred to various places; coupled with the needs and increased purchasing power of farmers after land reform, commerce is also developing day by day. Among the merchants, the cart, general merchandise, pharmacies, and restaurants are the most numerous. The above five industries have developed to 114 households. In order to activate the financial market, Tongyi Bank (privately operated) has recently been added. The industrial and commercial households are also very active in repairing and building houses and rectifying storefronts. The 40 storefronts and houses of 13 households that were burned down by the Fu bandits during the spring were all repaired in one month with the support of the government.\n\nAlthough Hejian's industry and commerce are gradually developing, there are still many shortcomings in the city's leadership of industry and commerce, such as the lack of clear development priorities for industrial development and the lack of long-term development plans. The development of the shoe industry has not opened up sales channels based on the needs of the masses, and only relies on public purchases, resulting in a large number of blind developments. As a result, some businesses have closed down after the public no longer purchases them. The housing problem has not been well resolved in the past. The houses of landlords and former rich peasants that were confiscated and requisitioned during land reform have not been properly dealt with; the rent collection in various villages is very inconsistent (some prices are too high), which has affected the development of some industrial and commercial households. The attendance of industrial and commercial households is unbalanced. For example, Dehe Yong, a grocery store, often sends laborers, while Baiyunzhong Factory and Dazhong Factory have not sent a laborer for several years. At the same time, due to the prosperity of the market and the large amount of goods being transported, industrial and commercial households often feel the difficulty of transportation capacity. These problems have had a certain impact on the further development of industry and commerce, and the city is currently studying solutions.\n\n[Taihang Electric] Changzhi City has seen significant development in industry and commerce after returning subsidies to industry and commerce and correcting forced mutual assistance for industrialists. Private capital has increased, and industrial technology has improved. In terms of commerce: according to incomplete statistics, 52 new merchants were added to the five streets in May and June, with a capital of 100,348,500 yuan, accounting for 9.1% of the city's total commercial capital, of which 30 were privately operated, with a capital of 60,970,000 yuan, accounting for 58.9% of the new capital. Mass cooperative enterprises totaled 18, with a capital of 24,215,500 yuan, accounting for 23.4% of the new capital. Publicly operated enterprises totaled 4, with a capital of 18,300,000 yuan, accounting for 17.7% of the new capital. There were 101 new vendors, accounting for 42.5% of the original vendors, with a capital of 43,072,200 yuan, an increase of two times compared to the past vendors' capital. The development of industry: is reflected in the improvement of technology and the improvement of tools. Xinghua Factory private workers used vegetable oil to make their own coal gas and glycerin, which were of good quality and sold well. The factory's business has greatly developed. Recently, more than 6,000 kilograms of gas and kerosene and more than 200 kilograms of glycerin have been produced, and all of them have been bought by merchants from Shijiazhuang, Linfen, and other places through the Hundred Goods Conference. A merchant from Shijiazhuang has also booked more than 2,000 kilograms of kerosene, which is being rushed day and night. Currently, the factory workers are studying local charcoal boiling to expand reproduction. Wang Fengming, a skilled worker at Yihhe Knitting Factory, transformed the pressing machine to increase efficiency tenfold. Wang Fengming led all the workers to design and make wooden frames with the factory's wood during their spare time, and transformed four small iron wheels and one large iron wheel. Without spending a penny, a new pressing machine was made in May. In the past, two people could iron 40 kilograms of material per day, but now three people can iron 600 kilograms per day with the new machine. In the past, ironing material required 7 kilograms of charcoal per day, but now no charcoal is needed. Handicraft industry has developed rapidly after correcting forced mutual assistance and promoting free production: The production of the fur industry on Qingzhen Street has a new look. Ma Baoze of No. 20 Street is a skilled maker of black sheepskin pants. Because he was forced to participate in mutual assistance last year, his production enthusiasm was not high, and he was also afraid that others would say he was rich, so he did not dare to take capital out to produce. After promoting free production, he took 290 leather pants (worth 150,000 yuan) to Jincheng the day after withdrawing from the group and exchanged them for 400 black leather pieces. The down pulled off by his children was enough to cover the cost, and the leather was pure profit. Now, after operating for more than a month, in addition to what has been sold, there are actually 250 pieces of white leather and 215 pieces of black leather in stock, worth 1,430,000 yuan. Miao Chou'e, a merchant of iron goods in Nanguan Street, actively collected iron from various places after understanding the policy. Since April, she has collected an average of more than 10,000 kilograms per month, earning more than 100,000 yuan per month. In order to accumulate capital and expand production, she took 600,000 yuan and borrowed 750,000 yuan from the bank to build a mill. With four animals and three and a half laborers, she can earn 22,000 yuan per day. From July 10th to this month's 10th, she has earned more than 660,000 yuan by grinding wheat in one month.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 河间长治两市端正工商政策　厂商增多产品提高\n\n1948-09-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　河间长治两市端正工商政策\n  　厂商增多产品提高\n    【冀中电】河间市自端正了工商政策、纠正了侵犯工商业的错误，而政府和银行对工商业更大力扶植，因此，该市工商业日渐发展。据一月份统计，除摊贩外，全市共有工商户二百四十二户；到七月底，已增加到三百四十一户，共增加了九十九户；新增户中工业占百分之六十二。在纺织业方面：该市过去本无基础，在政府扶植下，据八月份统计，已由一月份的十户织布户增加到廿四户，并带动一部纺织妇女。只群众工厂即带动四百八十户。在产品的质量上，亦日见提高。如群众、新生等工厂织的条格花纹等十余种土布，广发、益华织的袜子等都很坚固，畅销附近各县。最近为解决纺织户的熟棉问题，电灯公司已研究出用电力带动六个轧花机，每日可出熟棉五百斤，现已按上了一个，其他正在安置。在铁行方面：除现在铁匠炉十二个经常制造农具外，并有铁工厂八个。振中、振兴、大中等四户出品的前后中轴和轴挡，质量很好，行销石门、冀南等地。大中还创造了铸扣机。某铁工厂铸出的铁锅，常不够卖。现正大力制造水车，及其他农具。在木货制造上：已有木厂八个，主要是制造大车、水车、织布机和农具，以及副业工具。如兴合木厂半年中就制出大车二十二辆，小车七十五辆，修理大车七十五辆、织布机两张，还创造出轻便耠子（可以代替犁张，能节省畜力）。化学工业方面：现有造胰厂等三户，群众工厂马经理并研究出用土碱熬成火碱，可以代替洋碱，现已试验成功。万有工厂七个月的纯利赚了六十一万九千元。玉华工厂已能自治油墨、墨汁、墨水等。车新药房开始自制大王油，十滴水、仁丹、避瘟散等药品。民生火柴厂制火柴，也已试验成功。鞋业到麦秋前后已发展到六十来户，七百个工人，带动群众二千五百人（大部是妇女）。从四月廿日到六月十日五十天即出鞋一万四千三百七十九双。自整庄后，鞋的质量已大为提高。在商业方面：由于该市处于冀中中心，一般货物多集中于该市再转各地；再加上土改后农民的需要及购买力的提高，使商业也日益发展。坐商中尤以车子行，广货、杂货、药铺、饭店等五行最多。以上五种行业已发展到一百一十四户。为了活动市面金融，最近又添设了同益银号（私营）。各工商户在修理与建筑房子、整顿门面上也很积极，春季被傅匪窜扰时烧毁的十三户四十间门面和房子，在政府扶植下，于一个月中全部修好。\n    河间工商业虽日渐发展，但在该市对工商业的领导上仍有不少缺点，如发展工业与发展重点不明确，缺乏长期发展的计划。对鞋业的发展，没根据群众的需要打开销路，只依靠公家收买，使大量盲目的发展，结果公家不收买以后，有的歇了业。对于房子问题过去也未很好解决。土改中没收与征收地主旧富农的房子尚未适当处理；各乡收租很不一致（有的价太高），影响到部分工商户的发展。各工商户出勤不平衡，如杂货铺德和永三个人经常出夫，白云中工厂和大中工厂几年未出过一个夫。同时，由于市场的繁荣，货物大量的转运，工商户常常感到运输力的困难。这些问题，都给了工商业进一步发展上起了一定的影响，现该市正研究解决中。\n    【太行电】长治市经过退补工商业及纠正对于工业者的强迫互助后，工商业均有显著的发展。私营资本增加，工业技术提高。商业方面：据不完整统计，五条街五、六月新增坐商五十二家，资金一万万零三百四十八万五千元，占全市商业总资金百分之九点一，内中私营三十户，资金六千零九十七万元，占新增资金百分之五十八点九。群众合作事业十八家，资金二千四百二十一万五千元，占新增资数百分之二十三点四。公营四家，资金一千八百三十万元，占新增资数百分之一七点七。摊贩新增一百零一个，占原有摊贩百分之四二点五，资金四千三百零七万二千二百元，较过去摊贩资金增加二倍。工业的发展：表现在技术的提高与工具的改良上。兴华工厂私营工人以植物油自制煤汽、甘油，质量好、销路广，该厂营业大为发展。最近制出之汽、煤油六千余斤，甘油二百余斤，经过百货大会已全部让石庄、临汾等地客商买去。石家庄某客商又预定两千余斤煤油，正日夜赶制中。现该厂工人正研究土煮黑，以扩大再生产。义合成针织工厂技术工人王凤鸣，改造压料机使效率增加十倍。王凤鸣带领全体工人于工余时间设计用厂里木料做木架，改造了四个小铁轮，一个大铁轮，没化一个钱，于五月做成新的压料机。过去每天二人能熨四十斤料子，改用新机后每天三人可熨六百斤，过去每天熨料需用木炭七斤，现在已不需用木炭。手工业在纠正强迫互助，提倡自由生产后迅速发展：清真街毛皮业生产有新气象，廿头街马保则是做黑羊皮裤的把式，因去年强制他参加互助，生产情绪不高，同时又怕别人说他富，不敢往出拿资本生产。提倡自由生产后，退组的第二天即拿皮裤二百九十张（合十五万元）到晋城换成四百张黑皮回来，和他孩拔下毛绒就够了本，皮是净利。到现在营业一月余，除卖出的外，实存白皮二百五十张，黑皮二百一十五张，合一百四十三万元。南关街铁货商人苗丑女了解政策后，积极到各地收铁。从四月起每月平均收万斤以上，月赚洋十万余元。为积累资本，扩大生产，又自拿六十万元，银行贷款七十五万元内设磨坊一座，有四个牲口雇三个半劳力每天可赚洋二万二千元，从七月十日到本月十日，一月内磨麦已赚六十六万余元。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 11th. Electric News Agency, Warsaw, September 6th: The Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party held a plenary session from August 31st to September 3rd and passed a resolution that made an outstanding analysis of the development of erroneous ideological tendencies within the Workers' Party and stipulated the Party's tasks for thoroughly liquidating erroneous tendencies in the coming period. At the Central Committee plenary session, a total of thirty-eight speeches and analyses were made, including the report by the current General Secretary and President of Poland, Beirut, on \"Right-leaning and Nationalist Revisionism within the Party's Leadership Organs and Methods for Overcoming Them,\" and the report by Minister of Industry, Mintz, on \"The Current Tasks of the Workers' Party in Rural Economic and Social Policy.\"\n\nThe resolution of the Central Committee plenary session first traced the history of right-leaning tendencies in the leadership of the Workers' Party, emphasizing that this tendency was centered on the former General Secretary Gomulka. The resolution stated: Because these manifestations of nationalism, right-leaning tendencies, and opportunism have appeared from time to time since the war period, they cannot be regarded as tactical disagreements but must be recognized as dangerous tendencies of right-leaning ideology. From November 1943 to August 1944, the Workers' Party, as the representative of the revolutionary program of national liberation in alliance with the Soviet Union, increased its prestige day by day. At this time, the domestic and foreign reactionaries in Poland, supported by the Germans, fiercely opposed the Workers' Party, attempting to isolate, split, and eliminate it. It was precisely in such a difficult period that the first erroneous idea appeared among the leaders – that the working class lost its role as the leading force in the struggle to seize state power when it formed an alliance with peasant parties. Although this idea was defeated, a lack of confidence and loyalty to the working class was still manifested in the leadership organs of the Workers' Party.\n\nAfter liberation, the opposition was so shameless and ugly, and the offensive of the terrorists represented by Mikolajczyk became increasingly acute. At this time, the tendency to succumb to the violent pressure of the bourgeoisie was secretly nurtured. However, despite these enormous pressures, \"the vigilance and activity of the working class were strengthened, and the Workers' Party consolidated its party organizations at all levels because it was facing an enemy that was trying to restore the power of the landlords and capitalists.\" During this period, the leadership organs of the Workers' Party were also strengthened and political flexibility was enhanced. There was an increase in the number and political maturity of party members, and the understanding of the basic tasks of people's democracy – i.e., social and economic reform, transforming state institutions, and eliminating the terrorist, underground, and Mikolajczyk reactionaries – was also improved.\n\nThe resolution continued: However, the negative and dangerous tendencies in the Party's leadership organs were obvious, especially the tendency to conceal the fact that: \"Poland's path to socialism is only a part of the worldwide path to socialism, and the only difference is that we Poles are carrying out the transformation based on what we can learn from the experience of Soviet socialist builders, while also constantly considering the new possibilities and special conditions of Poland's historical development.\"\n\nThe Workers' Party resolution specifically quoted Gomulka and others as \"shamefully creating a dividing line between the former Polish Communist Party (on the one hand) and the Polish Workers' Party (on the other hand) on the issue of revolutionary tasks and international traditions.\" First, after Mikolajczyk fled Poland and the Cominform was formed, the right-leaning bias within the Party, especially as expressed by Gomulka, was strengthened. Second, Gomulka believed that people's democracy developed naturally and did not require a sharpened class struggle, especially in the countryside. This error strengthened the forces of capitalism; for example, machine stations supplied rich peasants under the same conditions as poor peasants. Third, there was a growing tendency to achieve organizational unity with the entire Polish Socialist Party without purging its right wing, deliberately ignoring the danger of future nationalist and opportunist splits within the unified party. Fourth, the Minister of Culture of the Central Committee, Bankowski, a follower of Gomulka's line, implemented an opportunist and wavering (eclectic) cultural policy. Fifth, a non-Party attitude towards criticism, an extreme lack of self-criticism, and an uncomradely indifference towards colleagues were adopted in the Party's leadership organs.\n\nThe resolution forcefully stated: The tendency to want to \"stabilize\" capitalist elements in people's democracy fell into the trap of the reactionaries, who relied on this artificial \"stabilization\" to fatten and grow: at a time when the class struggle was becoming more acute and entering a new stage, this tendency helped the growth of capitalist elements.\n\n\"In a people's democracy, socialism can only be achieved by following the path of closer and more consolidated cooperation with the Soviet Union. At the same time, in the context of an increasingly acute international situation, closer and more consolidated cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democracies is also needed to defend sovereignty and prevent the prying eyes of American imperialism.\"\n\nDuring the Yugoslav event, what was revealed within the Polish Workers' Party clearly showed that right-leaning and nationalist biases were not accidental phenomena but were part of a type of anti-Marxist-Leninist fundamental principles and opposition to the best traditions of the working-class movement in the Polish revolution that had been developing for the past five years. Former General Secretary Gomulka made a statement to the Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party in June opposing the Cominform's criticism of the Yugoslav Communist leadership group; this statement was not published due to the decision of the majority of the Central Committee. This statement exposed Gomulka's attitude. If this anti-Marxist ideology is not thoroughly liquidated, there is a danger that the Workers' Party \"may be pushed onto a dangerous road, resulting in ideological surrender and serious national disasters. If this ideology is not liquidated, the Party cannot achieve the unity of the working class on the basis of Marxism-Leninism,\" socialism cannot be achieved, and Poland cannot occupy an important position in the international front for freedom and progress. The resolution therefore called on the entire party to begin a struggle against nationalist biases and to begin a period of intense self-criticism arising from this, and the leadership organs were not exempt.\n\nThe resolution forcefully stated: \"Under the leadership of the Central Committee, headed by the Politburo, the Workers' Party adhered to the Marxist-Leninist position, maintained an inseparable link with the working class, and opposed the biases that occurred at the June plenary session of the Central Committee and in daily work.\"\n\nThe resolution finally demanded that Workers' Party members – from the highest leaders to ordinary party members: 1. Recognize that underestimating the revolutionary forces in Poland and overestimating the reactionary forces is an adaptation to petty-bourgeois psychology and erroneous ideologies. 2. Terminate all attempts to reconcile the class struggle (especially in the countryside). 3. Fully recognize the role of the Bolshevik Party in the international anti-imperialist camp. 4. Clearly understand the progress that people's democratic countries should take in developing towards socialism. 5. Learn more from the experience of Soviet socialism, the history of the Bolshevik Party, and its leading role in the world. 6. Terminate the careless and liberal attitude towards theoretical principles, and avoid ideological confusion among intellectuals in the Party by applying Marxism to literature, academia, and science. 7. Be more cautious in absorbing new party members and prevent speculators and other alien elements from infiltrating the Party. 8. Have a clearer understanding of the Party's role and promote the enthusiasm of all party members from top to bottom. 9. Fully understand the content of the class struggle and the inseparable link between the struggle of the Polish working class and the struggle of the Bolshevik Party and other communist parties. 10. Understand the necessity of party unity and party discipline, and fight against factions and other splitters. Finally, eliminate all hostile ideological influences within the Party, eliminate opportunism, and influence the Polish Socialist Party in this regard, so that the two parties can achieve unity on a sound ideological basis.展開 Self-criticism, oppose bureaucracy, and develop party relations up and down on the basis of comradely friendship. The resolution concluded: Once the links between party members are strengthened, the links between the working class and the poor and middle peasants will also be strengthened.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 波兰工人党中央全会决议　克服党内右倾错误思想  贝鲁特同志接替哥穆尔卡任总书记\n\n1948-09-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　波兰工人党中央全会决议\n  　克服党内右倾错误思想\n    贝鲁特同志接替哥穆尔卡任总书记\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】电通社华沙六日电：波兰工人党中央委员会于八月三十一日至九月三日召开全会并通过决议，对工人党内错误思想倾向的发展作了卓越的分析，并规定了党在今后时期彻底清算错误倾向的任务。在中央全会上，共作了三十八篇演说和分析，其中包括现任总书记、波兰总统贝鲁特关于“党的领导机构内的右倾和民族主义的修正主义及其克服的方法”的报告，和实业部长明兹关于“工人党在农村经济与社会政策方面的当前任务”的报告。\n    中央全会的决议，首先追溯工人党领导中右倾倾向的历史，强调指出这种倾向是以前总书记哥穆尔卡为其中心的。决议称：由于这些民族主义、右倾主义和机会主义的表现自战争时期起即已时时出现，因此，不能认为它们是策略上的分歧，而必须认识他们是右倾思想的危险倾向。自一九四三年十一月至一九四四年八月，工人党作为与苏联联盟的民族解放之革命纲领的代表，其威信日益增长。这时，德国人支持下的波兰国内外反动派，猛烈地反对工人党，力图孤立、分裂和消灭它。正是在这样一个困难的时期，领导人中首次出现了这样一种错误思想——即工人阶级在与农民党派结成联盟时丧失了它作为争取国家政权斗争中领导力量的作用。虽然这种思想被打败了，然而，在工人党的领导机关中，还是表现出对工人阶级力量缺乏信心和忠诚。\n    在解放以后，反对派是那样的无耻和丑恶，以米科拉兹柯为代表的恐怖主义者的攻势愈益尖锐了，这时，那些向资产阶级的狂暴压力屈服的倾向在暗地里培养着。可是，尽管这些巨大的压力，“工人阶级的警惕性和活动加强了，工人党巩固了它的各级党的组织，因为它面对着的是一个力图恢复大地主和资本家政权的敌人。”在这一期间，工人党领导机关也加强了，而且增进了政治上的灵活性。党员在数量上和政治成熟性上有了增进，而且对于人民民主主义的基本任务——即社会和经济改革，改造国家机构，肃清恐怖主义的、地下的和米科拉兹柯的反动派，认识上也提高了。\n    决议继称：可是，党的领导机关中，消极与危险的倾向是显而易见的，特别是隐匿下述事实的倾向，这事实就是：“波兰走向社会主义的道路，只是全世界走向社会主义道路的一部分，所不同的，只限于我们波兰人在进行变革的时候，是根据我们从苏联社会主义建设者的经验中所能学得的东西为基础，同时也经常考虑到波兰历史发展的新的可能性和特殊条件。”\n    工人党决议于此特别引述哥穆尔卡等“在革命任务与国际传统问题上在前波兰共产党（一方面）与波兰工人党（另一方面）之间，可耻地造成了一条分界线。”第一，在米科拉兹柯逃出波兰与情报局组成之后，党内的右倾偏向，特别是通过哥穆尔卡表现出来的，是增强了。第二，哥穆尔卡以为人民民主主义是自然而然发展的，不需要经过特别是在农村中的尖锐化的阶级斗争，这种错误加强了资本主义因素的力量，例如机器站以供给贫农同样的条件供给富农使用。第三，有一种日益增长的倾向，即实现与整个波兰社会党组织上统一而不清除其右翼，故意看不见将来统一后党内民族主义和机会主义分裂的危险。第四，中央委员会文化部长、哥穆尔卡路线的追随者班科夫斯基执行了机会主义的和动摇不定的（折衷的）文化政策。第五，对批评的非党态度，极端缺乏自我批评，在党领导机关中对同事采取非同志的漠不关心态度。\n    决议力称：想要“稳定”人民民主主义中资本主义因素的倾向，坠入了反动派的圈套中，他们正是靠这种人为的“稳定”肥壮和成长起来：在阶级斗争更加尖锐化和进入新阶段的时候，这种倾向帮助了资本主义因素的成长。\n    “在人民民主主义国家中，只有循着与苏联更密切和更巩固合作的道路才能达到社会主义。同时，在国际形势日益尖锐化的情况下，为保卫主权、制止美帝国主义窥伺，也需要与苏联及其他人民民主国家更密切和更巩固的合作。”\n    在南斯拉夫事件发生的期间，波兰工人党党内所显露的事情已经很清楚地可以看到，右倾和民族主义的偏向不是偶然的现象，而是过去五年来发展着的反马列主义基本原则，和反对波兰革命的工人阶级运动最优良传统的那种类型的一部分。前总书记哥穆尔卡曾于六月间对波兰工人党中央委员会发表声明，反对共产党情报局对南共领导集团的批评；由于中央委员会大多数的决定，这一声明没有发表。这一声明暴露了哥穆尔卡的态度。如果不彻底地清算这种反马克思主义的思想，那就有这样的危险，即工人党“可能被推上危险的道路，而招致思想上的投降与国家严重的灾难。如果不清算这种思想，党就不能在马列主义的基础上实现工人阶级的统一”，社会主义也就不能达成，波兰也就不能在争取自由与进步的国际阵线中居于重要的地位。决议因此要求全党开始进行反对民族主义偏向的斗争，开始因此而引起的紧张的自我批评时期，领导机关亦不得例外。\n    决议力称：“在以政治局为首的中央委员会领导下，工人党坚持了马列主义的立场，保持了与工人阶级的不可分的联系，并反对了在中央委员会六月全会上以及在日常工作中所发生的偏向”。\n    决议最后要求工人党党员——上自最高领导人、下至普通党员：一、要认识过低估计波兰革命力量而过高估计反动力量，是一种对小资产阶级心理与错误思想的适应。二、终止一切调和（特别是在农村中的）阶级斗争之企图。三、充分认识布尔什维克党在国际反帝国主义阵营中的作用。四、清楚了解人民民主国家向社会主义发展所应采取的进度。五、更多学习苏联社会主义的经验，布尔什维克党的历史及其在世界上所起的领导作用。六、终止对理论原则之漫不经心的与自由主义的态度，并以马克思主义最近在文学、学术与科学问题上的运用，避免党内知识分子思想上的混乱。七、吸收新党员须更加慎重，并防止投机分子及其他异己分子渗入党内。八、更加清楚地认识党的作用及发扬由上到下所有党员的积极性。九、要做到充分了解阶级斗争的内容，及波兰工人阶级之斗争与布尔什维克党及其他共产党之斗争两者间的不可分割的联系。十、要做到了解党内团结和党的纪律的必要，对小派别及其他分裂分子作斗争。最后，要清除党内各种敌性的思想影响，清除机会主义，并且在这方面影响波兰社会党，俾使两党能够在健全的思想基础上达成统一。展开自我批评，反对官僚主义，并在同志之谊的基础上发展党的上下关系。决议末称：党员与党员间的联系一经加强，将使工人阶级与贫农、中农之间的联系也得以加强。"

The new General Secretary, Bierut (President of Poland), delivered a lengthy report on the results of the Polish Workers' Party Central Committee Plenum. Discussing the crisis the Workers' Party had experienced over the past three months due to the exposure of right-leaning and nationalist deviations, Bierut pointed out that the Party had emerged from the crisis and become stronger and more resilient than before. He pointed out that despite the errors, the Central Committee's line was correct. Bierut then discussed the tasks facing the Party's organizations at all levels and the entire Party in implementing the Central Committee's resolutions. Former General Secretary Gomulka spoke during the discussion of the report, expressing his full agreement with the Central Committee's resolutions. In describing his past position, he admitted that it was wrong and anti-Marxist.\n    The Polish Workers' Party National Working Cadre Conference passed a resolution stating: The Central Committee's resolution clearly explains the danger of right-leaning and nationalist deviations, and points out its roots and ways to overcome it. The conference welcomed the Central Committee's resolution, considering it a manifestation of strengthening international solidarity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the Communist and Workers' Parties of people's democratic countries, and with progressive forces in the West. The conference saw the only correct path to guarantee Poland's independence in the strengthening of this international solidarity. The conference pointed out that in the face of new tasks, the entire Party will unite around the Marxist-Leninist Party Central Committee.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Telecommunications Agency, Warsaw, 7th: Polish Deputy Prime Minister Gomulka recently broadcast to the district committees, towns, and factory cadres of the Polish Workers' Party. Explaining why he could no longer lead the Polish Workers' Party as General Secretary, he said, \"In the Party's leading organs, especially the position of General Secretary, you must have someone who is firm and unwavering in thought. Our Party is a fighting party, and only when the leader is unwavering can we win in the struggle.\" Referring to his errors and vacillations, Gomulka said that their basis was his \"lack of understanding of the basic ideological content of the relationship between people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union, and a lack of understanding of the leading role played by the Bolshevik Party in the international anti-imperialist struggle. This lack of understanding was also based on my erroneous assessment of the Yugoslav events.\" Gomulka told listeners, \"When capitalists, landlords, and speculators should be liquidated, when we fought against terrorist bandits and reactionary underground activities, I never wavered, but when our Party faced a more acute class struggle, comrades, I wavered.\" Finally, Gomulka urged them to draw appropriate lessons from his mistakes.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 波工人党全国干部大会　拥护中央全会决议　哥穆尔卡广播承认错误\n\n1948-09-14\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　波工人党全国干部大会\n  　拥护中央全会决议\n  　哥穆尔卡广播承认错误\n    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社华沙七日电：波兰工人党全国工作干部大会于九月六日在华沙举行，出席大会者一千余人。新总书记贝鲁特（波兰总统）发表关于波兰工人党中央全会之成果的长篇报告。在论及工人党三月来由于右倾与民族主义偏向的揭露所经历的危机时，贝鲁特指出：党已自危机中脱出并变得比过去更加壮大与坚强了。他指出，尽管犯有错误，但中央委员会的路线是正确的。贝鲁特继而论述党的各级组织及整个党在履行中央全会之决议上所面临的任务。前总书记哥穆尔卡在讨论报告中发言，他表示完全同意中央全会的决议。在述及其过去的立场时，他承认那是错误的而且是反马克思主义的。\n    波兰工人党全国工作干部大会通过决议称：中央全会的决议，明确地说明了右倾与民族主义偏向的危险，并指明了它的根源及其克服的办法。大会欢迎中央全会的决议，认为这是加强与苏联共产党、与各人民民主国家共产党及工人党、与西方进步力量之国际团结的表现。大会在这个国际团结的加强中，看到了保证波兰独立的唯一正确的道路。大会指出：在这面临着新的任务之际，全党将团结在马——列主义之党中央的周围。\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】电通社华沙七日电：波兰副总理哥穆尔卡顷对波兰工人党的区委会、城镇及工厂的干部广播。在解释他何以不能再作为总书记而领导波兰工人党时，他说：“在党的领导机关中，特别是总书记一职，你们必须有坚强的，在思想上没有丝毫动摇的人。我们党是进行斗争的党，只有领袖不动摇，才能在斗争中获得胜利。”哥穆尔卡在谈到他的错误与动摇时称：它们的基础就是我“对人民民主国家与苏联关系的基本思想内容缺乏了解，对布尔什维克党在国际反帝国主义斗争的阵营中所起的领导作用缺乏了解。这种缺乏了解，也基于我对南斯拉夫事件的错误估价。”哥穆尔卡告听众称：“当资本家、大地主与投机者应予清算时，当我们对恐怖主义匪帮与反动的地下活动进行斗争时，我从来没有动摇过，但当我党临到更尖锐的阶级斗争时，同志们，我动摇了。”最后，哥穆尔卡敦促进他们从他的错误中吸取适当的教训。"

    "content": "A Factory in Shijiazhuang Launches Production Competition\n  　\"Ba Ju\" Output Surges\n    [Shijiazhuang News] A factory in Shijiazhuang launched a heated competition among its forging workers to produce \"Ba Ju\" (a type of iron hook with curved points at both ends, used to join two pieces of wood), which also spurred some of the factory's other workers to participate in the competition. The Shijiazhuang Daily reported on August 13th that Workshop C had a production surge of Ba Ju on the 6th and 7th, with one furnace achieving a peak output of 300 pieces. Upon seeing this news, the director of Workshop A said to the workers, \"They're even reporting 300 pieces in the newspaper!\" The workers immediately replied, \"We'll make at least 450 or 500!\" Coincidentally, the next day, the factory received an order for tens of thousands of Ba Ju. The workers of Workshop A took the lead in proposing a challenge, setting a competition standard of producing 450 Ba Ju made from 3-fen iron rods (approximately 9.5 mm in diameter) within eight hours, while ensuring good quality. Workshops B, C, and D quickly responded. Workshop B proposed a competition standard of producing 360 Ba Ju made from 4-fen iron rods (approximately 12.7 mm in diameter, thicker and more difficult to forge) within eight hours. The administrative department accepted these requests and, in collaboration with the labor union, organized a judging committee to announce the competition conditions. The first condition was the aforementioned output standard. The second was to ensure good quality. The third was to use three workers per furnace using a blower, or four workers using bellows. The fourth was that any output below the set quantity, quality, or violation of the personnel number regulations would result in disqualification for commendation.\n\n　　The competition began on the 17th and exceeded the predetermined standards on the first day. Wang Liansuo's furnace in Workshop A exceeded the 3-fen iron rod production target by 25%. Workshop B also exceeded the 4-fen iron rod production target by 25%. Output increased rapidly. By the third day, Wang Liansuo and Yu Xinfa's furnace had produced 1,000 pieces in ten hours, and a furnace in Workshop C had produced 950 pieces. During the intense labor of the competition, red-hot iron filings splashed under the heavy hammers. When worker Wu Dongxi burned his hands and feet, he immediately helped with other tasks. The workers didn't have time to drink hot water, so they cooled boiling water and drank it quickly while continuing to work. When the tong-holder went to relieve himself, someone else would pick up the tongs, unwilling to stop even for a moment. The veteran tong-holder in Workshop D, Chi Aibao, 58 years old, was also full of energy, increasing his output from 580 pieces (in ten hours) to 850 pieces, exceeding the target by 51%. By the 26th, the highest record was held by Wang Liansuo's furnace, which produced 1,340 Ba Ju made from 3-fen iron rods in nine and a half hours. The output of 4-fen iron rods from the same furnace increased from 715 pieces to 730 pieces. During the competition, Workshop C also learned the simplified method of cutting iron rods from Workshop A, reducing the number of people cutting from five (first marking the dimensions, then cutting, requiring two steps) to three. This saved labor. The judging committee initially set standards, distributed them to each workshop to follow, and regularly checked the quality to ensure that all products entering the warehouse were good. In the following days, feeling that the quantity was increasing too quickly and fearing that the workers would be overworked, the committee held three consecutive meetings to address the issue of protecting the workers' health. At the meeting on the 26th, they requested that the workers in each workshop and furnace report a number representing a normal level of output based on their specific circumstances, to be submitted to the judging committee for final evaluation. On the same day, the judging committee, along with the directors and inspectors of each workshop, conducted a major quality inspection of the products produced since the beginning of the competition at the warehouse. They found that the quality of the finished products was generally similar to that before the competition and that they were all usable. The results of the evaluation were: Workshop A was ranked first for 3-fen iron rod production, followed by Workshops D and C. Workshop B was ranked first for 4-fen iron rod production, followed by Workshop A. The overall production task is now more than halfway completed and is expected to be finished several days ahead of schedule. In addition, influenced by this Ba Ju production competition, the daily output of 6-fen bridge bolts in a certain workshop also increased from 55 pieces per shift (eight hours) to 95 pieces, exceeding the target by 73%. Staff members in the Personnel Department, Secretary's Office, and General Affairs Section also challenged each other, coming to work early and adding half an hour to one hour of voluntary labor per person, while ensuring increased work efficiency. The factory-wide competition movement is in progress.

    "content": "(Taihang Electric) In Anyang's Sixth District, where secret society activity was most rampant, all seventy-seven villages' secret societies have disintegrated due to our correct policies and patient efforts at winning over and educating the people. Thirty-seven rifles were also surrendered, greatly striking at the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to use secret societies to develop armed forces and harm the people. This district was directly ruled by Wang Huaibi, a notorious local tyrant, landlord, bandit, and head of the secret society, which had been in existence for twenty years. Last summer, with the support and utilization of the Kuomintang reactionaries, bandit leader Wang Huaibi further used armed threats combined with deception, leading to a great expansion of the secret society. In addition, at that time, we did not correctly implement the policies for the new areas, especially regarding the policy towards secret societies, failing to strike at the small number of the worst elements and win over and disintegrate the blindly following elements. Instead, we engaged in left-leaning, reckless actions, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. The Kuomintang reactionaries took the opportunity to spread rumors, creating opposition between the masses and us. As a result, by last October, the secret society had spread throughout the district, greatly hindering our work in the area. During cadre rectification, we conducted a deep examination and criticism of the past deviations in policy implementation and changed the past style of administrative orders in practical actions to improve relations with the masses. This spring, when the disaster was severe, an old woman once collapsed on the road due to hunger. Our district cadres saw her and carried her to the district office, where she was saved. District cadres and militiamen who went to the countryside also brought their own rice and cooked their own meals, not troubling the masses. To solve the difficulties in the people's lives, the government also distributed more than 10,000 jin of grain for relief and tried to help the masses shift to production. The local masses generally grew closer to us emotionally.\n\nAfter our work deepened, we proceeded to carry out work in all aspects. First, we inspired the masses' hatred of the enemy from the perspective of their immediate interests and discussed and calculated the burden accounts with the masses, to see whether organizing a secret society was beneficial or not. In Li Guan Village, all 240 households spent more than 20 dan of rice to buy eight guns, and the bandit leader continued to extort them, averaging more than 80 jin per mu, so that 130 households in the village had nothing to eat. District cadres and militiamen went deep into the villages to widely publicize our policies and expose the enemy's conspiracies. For example, the enemy in the Li Yuan area said they were gathering the secret society for a meeting, but they ended up conscripting soldiers. We used these facts to educate the people, making them realize the harm the secret society caused them and the reasons for their poverty. On the other hand, we also educated landlords and rich peasants, pointing out the way forward for them, thereby isolating and striking at the worst people. Under such efforts, the secret society in Anyang's Sixth District gradually disintegrated and eventually completely collapsed.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 端正政策团结多数　安阳六区会门瓦解\n\n1948-09-14\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　端正政策团结多数\n  　安阳六区会门瓦解\n    【太行电】会门活动最厉害的安阳六区，在我端正政策与耐心争取教育下，全区七十七个村的会门全部瓦解，并缴出步枪三十七支，大大打击了国民党反动派利用会门发展武装危害人民的阴谋。该区是安阳著名大奸霸地主土匪和会门头子王怀泌所直接统治的地区，会门已有二十年历史。去年夏天在国民党反动派支持利用下，土匪头子王怀泌更以武装威胁结合欺骗，使会门得到了大发展。加以当时我没有正确执行新区政策，特别在对会门政策上，不是打击少数最坏的争取瓦解盲从分子，而是左倾蛮干，致引起群众极大不满，国民党反动派更乘机造谣，造成群众与我对立，因而到去年十月，会门便发展到全区，使我工作在该区受到很大阻碍。我方干部整编时对过去执行政策的偏向作了深刻的检查与批判，并在实际行动中改变了以往行政命令的作风，以便改善与群众的关系。今春灾荒严重时，有一次一个老太太饿倒在路上，我们区干部见了以后，把她背到区上救活。区干民兵下乡也自己带米作饭，不麻烦群众。为了解决群众生活困难，政府又发粮万余斤进行救济，并设法帮助群众转向生产。当地群众普遍在情感上接近了我们。\n    在我工作深入后，接着从各方面开展工作，首先从群众切身利益上启发群众对敌仇恨，并与群众讨论计算负担帐，看看组织起会门对自己有利没利。李官屯全村二百四十户，除买了八支枪用了二十余石米外，土匪头子还不断勒索，每亩平均出到八十斤以上，以致全村有一百三十户没吃的。区干民兵深入各村广泛的宣传我们的政策，揭发敌人阴谋。如李圆一带敌人说集合会门开会，结果抓了兵。用这些事实来教育老百姓，使他们认识到会门对自己的危害，及自己所以穷的原因。另一方面也教育地主富农，给他们指明出路，以此孤立与打击最坏的人。在这样努力下，安阳六区会门便逐渐分化以至全部瓦解。"

For example, after the postal worker in Wenxian picks up newspapers and delivers them to the Yanglei Town agency office in the Fourth District, this place is still eight miles away from the district. After the newspapers arrive, people are pulled from the village to deliver them to the district, but neither the district government provides compensation for this, nor does the post office pay them wages, yet they are expected to deliver every day. After the wheat harvest began, the agency office was not managed by anyone specifically and the township head was asked to be responsible. The township head is busy all day and also has to manage the postal agency work. Should the post office be allowed to randomly use people's labor without compensation in this way?

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Column: Inquiry and Reply\n\n　　Should Rickshaws Be Abolished?\n    Should Fortune-Tellers Be Banned?\n    To the Editor:\n    (1) Pingyao City has been liberated, and there are still many rickshaws on the streets. There are still people paying to ride in them. Although no military or government personnel have been seen riding, the people who do are local residents. However, I believe this is an inequality. My opinion: stipulate that rickshaws are only allowed to carry goods and not people, or abolish them altogether. Is this correct? What methods should be used to change this unequal phenomenon?\n    (2) On the streets of Pingyao, there are two professional fortune-tellers. Because the bandit army in Pingyao kidnapped many people when they fled, the people are hoping for the return of their sons and husbands, and many are going to have their fortunes told. Should their activities be stopped? Can their deceptive methods be exposed?\n    (Xiu Yun, Pingyao Branch of the Jinnan Bank)\n    Answer: (1) Rickshaws in the city are an unreasonable phenomenon in an exploitative society. In the past, due to the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudal forces, some farmers and unemployed workers who had lost their means of production were able to make a living from this. However, if they are abolished immediately after the liberation of the city, it will inevitably lead to the unemployment of a large number of rickshaw pullers. Not only will it not solve their problems, but it will also make it impossible for them to live. The basic solution is still to start with the development of urban industry and commerce and transportation. When industry and commerce are prosperous and urban transportation is developed, people will not need rickshaws as a means of transportation. Rickshaw pullers can also find a way out in other areas and no longer have to pull rickshaws. At that time, rickshaws may be reduced or eliminated. Therefore, they should neither be abolished now nor should it be stipulated that they are only allowed to carry goods and not people. Doing so would reduce the income of rickshaw pullers and be detrimental to them.\n    (2) Fortune-telling is a product of feudal society. Under certain conditions, that is, when the masses have not yet been organized and their level of awareness has not been raised, it has its market. Therefore, for fortune-tellers in newly liberated cities, persuasive mobilization should be used. Starting from their own interests, explain that this occupation has no future in the new society and advise them to engage in manual labor production or change their profession. The most important thing is to stabilize social order, develop mass culture, and develop production, so that the masses' level of awareness will gradually increase, and superstition will gradually be eliminated. Naturally, no one will go to have their fortune told. It is not good to forcibly ban it now.\n    As for the families of Pingyao Chiang's soldiers who are hoping for the return of their children, they should think of ways from a positive perspective, such as through relationships, letters, or other means, to persuade their children to take advantage of every possible opportunity to break away from the Chiang-Yan bandits and return to the liberated areas.

    "content": "Jinnan District Party Committee Holds Cadre Meeting\n　　Deploys Work for This Autumn and Next Spring\n    Determining to Continue to Complete and Conclude Land Reform, Party Consolidation, and Political Construction\n\n　　[Jinnan Electric] The Jinnan District Party Committee convened a meeting of district and county cadres on August 13th to thoroughly study the Central Committee's 1948 instructions on land reform and party consolidation. Based on this spirit and the extent of land reform in the district, the meeting determined the future work direction and tasks, as well as specific steps for implementation. Taking advantage of the relatively idle season for farmers, from September this year to April next year, the work of completing or concluding land reform, party consolidation, and political construction will be carried out, combined with winter production, to prepare for the large-scale production movement next year. Based on investigations and reports from various district and county party committees, the land reform work in the entire district was assessed. Except for areas of the Second District (Gaotang, Pingyuan) and parts of the Third District near Anyang where there are still small groups of armed special agents active, the entire district is considered consolidated. Moreover, after struggles such as rent reduction, interest reduction, grain lending, debt redemption, wage increases for hired workers, and the liquidation of traitors, the feudal system has been basically eliminated, but not completely. It is estimated that in the entire district, only areas with a population of about two million still require large-scale supplementary adjustments. According to the standards stipulated in the Central Committee's 1948 instructions on land reform and party consolidation, Jinnan can be roughly divided into two categories of areas (first and second category areas), with third category areas only found in individual villages. The first category areas account for approximately 75 percent of Jinnan. This type of area has two situations: one is that the feudal system has been eliminated, and land has been generally divided equally, with similar average landholdings for each class; however, a small number of landlords and rich peasants still occupy more and better land and property. The other is that the feudal system has been eliminated, and the land obtained by each class is the same as in the first category areas, but the land and property left for landlords and rich peasants are less than the average for peasants, resulting in an \"inverted pagoda\" phenomenon. These areas are mostly places that underwent major reviews last year. The second category villages are those where land reform is not thorough. These villages account for approximately 25 percent of Jinnan. Third category areas are only individual villages in the Jinnan District. According to a survey in Nangong County, only one out of more than one hundred villages is in this category. In the entire district, wrongly targeted middle peasants account for approximately 20 to 50 percent of the households that were struggled against. The reasons for this are: first, there was no unified standard for class division; second, the boundaries for local despots and traitors were not clearly defined; third, the idea of absolute egalitarianism was supported. According to statistics from Qinghe: in the county's 323 villages, 3,928 households were struggled against, of which 1,672 were middle and poor peasants who were wrongly targeted, accounting for 44.1 percent of the total number of households struggled against (they have now been returned and compensated). The Party in Jinnan, judging from the leading cadres and the majority of party members and their completion of party tasks since the War of Resistance Against Japan, is basically pure. However, impure thinking and work style are common. According to a survey of 12 villages in Xiazhen: out of a total of 343 party members, 42 were involved in corruption and embezzlement, seizing excessive fruits of labor, 12 unreasonably beat the masses, 16 sheltered landlords and rich peasants, 5 did not work, and 3 raped women, while 243 were actively working and had no major errors. A survey of 40 villages in the Fourth District: out of a total of 769 party members, 20 had consistently sheltered landlords and rich peasants, embezzled for personal gain, committed murder, engaged in sectarianism, coerced the masses, or raped women, accounting for 2.53 percent of the total number of party members. 151 individually sheltered landlords and rich peasants, constantly beat and scolded the masses, or engaged in corruption, accounting for 19.09 percent of the total number of party members. 237 built air-raid shelters for themselves, engaged in petty corruption, or had an undemocratic work style, accounting for 30 percent of the total number of party members. 361 had no errors, accounting for 45.46 percent of the total number of party members. According to a survey of party member composition in seven villages in Gaotang: out of 64 party members, 35 were poor peasants and 29 were middle peasants. In Feixiang's First District, there were a total of 789 party members, including 2 landlords, 14 rich peasants, 281 middle peasants, and 492 poor peasants. A survey of 93 villages in Xiazhen: there were 971 party members, including 712 poor peasants, 254 middle peasants, 3 rich peasants, and 2 landlords. From the above statistics, it can be seen that impure class composition is not serious, but it also shows that impurity exists. In more than 40 villages in Feixiang, 19 branches, except for two relatively good branches, the rest must be disbanded (the reason why they must be disbanded is not clearly explained, and the wording that the rest must be disbanded is also ambiguous, possibly referring to a part of the 40 villages surveyed. – Editor). The branch of a certain village is run by a father and son, and they do not develop others. In a certain village, there are eight party members, including three fathers and sons, three sisters-in-law, who are controlled by special agents and detached from the masses. In a certain village, seven party members are all controlled by special agents. This shows that political impurity within the Party is also serious. In order to further strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and to make rural branches the core of leadership, it is necessary to conscientiously carry out party consolidation in accordance with the policy of education and transformation.\n\n　　Based on the above situation, the future work direction and tasks are: to continue to complete and conclude land reform, party consolidation, and political construction. On this basis, prepare for all aspects of the large-scale production campaign next year, so as to provide the greatest support to the front lines and improve the people's lives. In late August, each unit will convene county and district cadre meetings to thoroughly discuss the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, autumn tax collection, manure accumulation, and wheat planting. Flood-stricken areas should focus on disaster relief through production. Around September 10th, land reform work in key land reform counties should come to an end. On September 15th, cadres will go to the villages. From the end of September to the beginning of October, the content of this phase of work should focus on production, specifically leading the masses in the autumn harvest and wheat planting, combined with doing a good job of social investigation, clarifying the land ownership situation in various types of villages and the situation within the Party. Combining production, correct the wrongly classified components of individual villages, and each district should focus on developing land ownership certificates for individual villages. In the first half or second half of October, each county will convene county and district cadre meetings again to thoroughly discuss land reform and party consolidation, and formulate a work plan to carry out land reform and party consolidation with a focus. Strive to conclude the supplementary adjustments before the lunar new year. After the lunar new year, continue party consolidation and political construction, and establish people's representative conferences at the county, district, and village levels. The work focus and methods for each type of village are: the work content of the first category of villages is: completing small-scale land adjustments, issuing land ownership certificates, correcting wrongly classified components, improving or enriching farmers' associations, compensating for losses of middle peasants, arranging for landlords and rich peasants, consolidating the party and building the government, re-determining burden standards, and other work. The work content of the second category of villages is: understanding the situation, conducting preliminary statistics, removing obstacles to land reform, classifying classes, organizing, mobilizing, or establishing poor peasant committees, making supplementary land adjustments, issuing land ownership certificates, preventing class enemies from participating in party consolidation, and by April next year, the entire district should transition to production. Farmers must pay attention to combining winter production with all preparations for the extensive large-scale production movement in the spring, during the spring plowing. In the large-scale production movement, farmers must prevent two deviations: one is being careless, only focusing on completing the task without regard for quality; the other is opposing doing things piecemeal, without a plan, and being slow. In the face of serious tasks and tight deadlines, call on leaders at all levels to be conscientious and responsible, unite their strength, train cadres well, unite Party activists and better elements, publicize policies, thoroughly understand the situation, make plans, and enlighten all the masses to take action and successfully complete the work tasks.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南区党委召开干部会议　布置今秋明春工作  确定继续完成和结束土改、整党、建政\n\n1948-09-15\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n　　冀南区党委召开干部会议\n  　布置今秋明春工作\n    确定继续完成和结束土改、整党、建政\n    【冀南电】冀南区党委于八月十三日，召开地、县干部会议，详细研究了中央一九四八年土改与整党指示。并根据此精神和本区土改程度，确定了今后工作方针与任务，以及具体执行的工作步骤。乘农民较闲季节，从今年九月始至明年四月，完成或结束土改整党、建政并结合冬季生产，作好明年开展大生产运动的一切准备工作。根据各地、县委的调查汇报，估计了全区土改工作。全区除二分区的高唐、平原，三分区接近安阳的部分地区，尚有小股武装特务活动外，均为巩固区。而且都是经过减租、减息，借粮斗争，赎地还债，雇工增资，反奸清算，土改等斗争，封建制度基本上已被消灭，但还没完全消灭。估计全区仅有二百万人口左右地区，还须作较大范围的抽补调剂。根据中央一九四八年关于土改与整党工作指示规定的标准，冀南大体可分两类地区（第一、二类地区），第三类地区只是个别村庄。第一类地区在冀南约占百分之七十五。此类地区有两种情况：一种是封建制度已经消灭，土地已大体平分，各阶层土地的平均数相差不多；尚有一小部分地主富农，占有较多较好的土地财产。另一种是封建制度已消灭，各阶层所得土地和一类区同，但留给地主富农的土地财产少于农民的平均数，有倒宝塔的现象。这种地区多是去年经过大复查的地方。第二类村是土改不彻底的。这类村在冀南约占百分之二十五。第三类地区，在冀南区仅是个别村庄。据南宫县调查，一百多个村中只有一个。全区误伤中农，约占被斗户的百分之廿到百分之五十。其原因：第一没有划阶级的统一标准；第二对恶霸汉奸的界线划分不明确；第三绝对平均主义的思想支持。据清河统计：全县三百二十三个村，被斗者三千九百二十八户，其中错斗的中、贫农占一千六百七十二户，占被斗户总数百分之四十四点一（现已退还补偿）。冀南的党从领导骨干，党员大多数，和自抗战来完成党的任务上来看，基本上是纯的。但思想作风不纯是普遍的。据夏津十二个村调查：共有党员三百四十三人，贪污腐化、多占果实的四十二人，无理捆打群众的十二人，包庇地主富农的十六人，不干工作的五人，强奸妇女的三人，工作积极和没有什么错误的二百四十三人。四分区四十个村的调查：共有党员七百六十九人，一贯包庇地主富农、贪污自肥、有杀人罪、闹宗派、强迫群众、强奸妇女的二十人，占党员总数的百分之二点五三。个别包庇地主富农、不断打骂群众、贪污腐化的一百五十一人，占党员总数百分之一九点零九。当防空洞、小贪污、作风不民主的二百三十七人，占党员总数百分之三十。没有错误的三百六十一人，占党员总数百分之四十五点四六。据高唐七个村的党员成份调查：六十四个党员中，贫农三十五人，中农二十九人。肥乡一区党员共七百八十九人，地主二人，富农十四人，中农二百八十一人，贫农四百九十二人。夏津九十三个村的调查：党员九百七十一人，贫农七百一十二人，中农二百五十四人，富农三人，地主二人。从以上统计来看，阶级成份不纯虽不严重，但也说明不纯是有的。肥乡四十多村，十九个支部，除两个支部较好外，其余都须解散（为什么须要解散未交代清，其余都要解散词句也含混，恐系指所调查的四十村的一部。——编者）。某村支部是父子，不发展别人。某村八个党员，父子三人，妯娌三人，被特务掌握，脱离群众。某村七个党员，都被特务掌握。这说明党内政治不纯也是严重的。为了更加密切党和群众的连系，使农村支部成为领导的核心，必须按照教育改造的方针，认真进行整党。\n    根据以上情况，今后的工作方针与任务：继续完成和结束土改、整党、建政。在此基础上，作好明年开展大生产的一切准备工作。以尽最大的支援前线，改善人民生活。八月下旬，各单位召开县、区干部会，详细讨论秋收、秋耕、秋征、积肥、种麦。水灾区要以生产救灾为主。九月十号左右，土改重点县，土改工作要告一段落。九月十五号，干部到村。九月底到十月初、这一段的工作内容：要以生产为主，具体领导群众秋收、种麦，结合作好社会调查，弄清各种类型村土地占有情况及党内的情况。并结合生产，改正个别村的错订成份，每个区要有重点的发展个村的土地证。十月上半月或下半月，各县再召开县、区干部会，详细讨论土改、整党，并订出工作计划，有重点的开展土改、整党。要争取阴历年前结束抽补。阴历年后继续整党、建政，建立县、区、村三级人民代表会。各类型村的工作中心及作法上，第一类村的工作内容是：完成小范围的土地调剂，发土地证，改正错订成份，改进或充实农会，补偿中农损失，按置地主富农，整党建政，重订负担标准等工作，第二类村工作内容是：了解情况进行初步统计，扫除土改障碍，划阶级，组织、发动或建立起贫民委员会，抽补调剂土地，发土地证明，阻止阶级敌人来整党，至明年四月全区转入生产，农民在每年春天的耕作进行中，都必须注意结合冬季生产为春天的广泛大生产运动的一切准备工作。在大生产运动中农民要防止两种偏向：一是粗枝大叶，只管作完不管好坏的急性子；二是反对作到哪里算哪里，没有计划，不紧张的慢性病。在任务严重，时间紧迫的情况下，号召各级领导认真负责，团结力量，训练好干部，团结党内积极分子和较好分子，宣传政策，深入了解情况，做好计划，启发所有群众，行动起来，胜利完成工作任务。"

    "content": "(Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram) Due to the heavy war service tasks in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region last year, many areas did not carry out autumn cultivation. Coupled with the initial discovery of insect pests and ineffective extermination efforts, the insect plague this year is quite severe. According to reports from local correspondents, meat worms eating corn first occurred in more than 20 villages in the first district of Neihuang on July 19. Subsequently, it was discovered in the first and sixth districts of Kunwu on August 7. On August 13, Dongming first discovered the problem in the third and eighth districts, gradually spreading to more than 200 villages in the first and second districts. Following this, cotton worms became prevalent in four districts of Chiping. Around August 16, insect plagues occurred in all eight districts of Shou Zhang, except for villages with irrigation. In the Shangnan sub-district of the first district, all the corn in the small districts was eaten up. Because the leadership initially believed that insects would not cause much harm, they underestimated the insect plague, leading to a widespread disaster throughout the county. As of September 5, in addition to the aforementioned counties and districts, insect plagues had also been discovered in over 300 square li in the third and fifth districts of Fanxian. In Yanggu, all five districts (the first, second, and third districts alone cover 150 square li) were affected. Four districts in Puyang (with the third district being more severe). Partial villages in four districts of Nanfeng. Partial villages in three districts of Puyang. All six districts of Xiaofeng. Partial villages in individual districts of Weihe. In Nanle, nine villages in the fifth district discovered the problem and immediately took action, but more than 500 mu of crops had already been eaten. Most of the four districts of Kunwu were affected, as were six districts of Juancheng, partial villages in one district of Linze, partial villages in four districts of Gaoling, more than a dozen villages in two districts of Quhe, an area of over ten li around the seventh district of Huaxian, certain areas of Weinan (four districts of Chiping and eight districts of Dong'a), an area of over 20 square li around the area, and individual villages in one district of Liaoyang (newly established county). Partial villages in two districts of Xuji. In total, 23 counties and 69 districts have been affected (it is estimated that some areas have not yet reported). Some areas have mostly suppressed the plague, some are still fighting it, some have eradicated it completely, and some are still developing. The types of insects include mole crickets, corn borers, date weevils, date stink bugs, armyworms, cutworms, grubs, scarabs, locusts, and small locusts, with armyworms and small locusts being the most devastating. They can eat all the leaves of grain and corn in just a few days. In Zhangzhuang and Liukui Village in the first district of Shou Zhang, people initially believed in gods and remained on the sidelines, failing to organize the masses to fight the insects. As a result, more than 35 qing of crops were eaten up in just a few days. In Dongming, only the third and eighth districts were initially affected. However, because the county was busy organizing the emergency repair of the Gaocun dangerous section of the Yellow River at the time, they did not pay enough attention to the insect plague, which gradually spread to many villages in the first and second districts, eating up more than 600 mu of crops. After the occurrence of this insect plague, the Sixth Special Commissioner's Office issued instructions on August 13, calling for strict prevention of insect disasters and pointing out that if insect plagues are discovered in various places, forces should be immediately organized to eliminate them within a limited time and that there should be no delay, causing the disaster area to expand. It also stated that in the process of organizing the masses to kill pests, experience should be drawn, and reports should be made at any time for dissemination. The District Party Committee issued a call on August 27 to eliminate insect pests and protect autumn seedlings. Subsequently, the Administrative Office, the Eighth and Ninth Special Commissioner's Offices, and some local party committees and county party committees also issued emergency insect catching instructions and notices. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily also issued an editorial, \"Make Every Effort to Eliminate Insect Pests,\" calling on the leading organs in various places to pay attention. Many areas implemented and promoted the spirit and experience of locust catching in 1944, organizing the masses to resolutely fight the insects, and achieved rapid annihilation results, breaking the masses' superstitious views of waiting and seeing, believing that they were \"divine insects\" that \"multiply the more they are killed,\" and the backward views of not wanting to organize and everyone looking after themselves, and correcting the cadres' paralysis and waiting and seeing, and absurd sayings such as using \"the masses are backward\" and \"superstitious\" as excuses. For example, after discovering insects, the Yanggu District Sub-committee immediately arranged for cadres to inspect and immediately led the masses to catch them. Although the leaders in Fanxian started fighting early, several villages in the first district were still eaten up. The dense insects discovered in Chiping have already been dealt with. Louying in the eighth district of Xuji rescued more than 1,100 mu. The Shanghe Third District Sub-committee initially did not pay enough attention and had more than 50 mu eaten up. Later, they persuaded the masses and rescued more than 800 mu. In addition, the Xuyi Seventh Team and training class of the Direct Hospital, and other organs and schools, participated in the insect eradication campaign after discovering insects, leading the masses to fight them and achieved great results. However, some leading organs and cadres were paralyzed and wavering about the insect plague, and the masses were superstitious and did not act, leaving them helpless. For example, in Shou Zhang, a small number of insects were discovered on August 17, the number of insects increased by August 22, the county made the decision to fight them on August 26, the district cadres were mobilized on August 29, and the masses were not widely mobilized until August 31. The cadres of the first district were still holding meetings to discuss other work when insects crawled into the courtyard, causing the insect plague to spread throughout the county, although the losses were recovered. Some experience has been gained in insect catching: During publicity and education, it must be pointed out that this year's insect plague is the reproduction of a small number of pests in the past. Killing one today is equivalent to killing hundreds or thousands in the future or next year, breaking the nonsense of \"heavenly insects,\" \"divine insects,\" and \"the more they are killed, the more they multiply.\" If necessary, completely eliminate one piece first to protect the seedlings, so as to lay the foundation for the masses' confidence and improve their enthusiasm, and then catching them will be faster. In areas where autumn seedlings are well protected, the leaders pay attention, the cadres personally take action and combine with the organization of the masses to fight the insects, and the enthusiasm for fighting the insects persists. In addition to organizing forces to fight, the masses in Liukui Village in Shou Zhang are carrying out weeding and plowing. The Nanfeng Third District is carrying out the work of digging and catching moths to prevent insect roots from harming next year's production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀鲁豫去年没有秋耕　今年虫害相当严重\n\n1948-09-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀鲁豫去年没有秋耕\n  　今年虫害相当严重\n    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区由于去年的战勤任务繁重，不少地区未进行秋耕，兼之开始发现虫害，扑灭不力，致今年虫灾相当严重。据各地通讯员报导，首先七月十九日在内黄一区二十多个村发生肉虫吃棒子，嗣后昆吾一、六区于八月七日发现。东明于八月十三日首先在三、八区发现，逐渐蔓延到一、二区二百多个村，继之茌平四个区普遍发生棉虫。八月十六日前后，寿张八个区除上水的村外，均发生虫灾，其中一区尚南小区中小区的棒子全部吃光。因为领导上开始认为虫子生不了多大害，轻视虫害，致使虫灾普遍全县。截至九月五日止，除上述各县区外，已发现虫灾的范县三、五区有三百多方里。阳谷全县五个区（只一、二、三区就方圆一百五十方里）。濮县四个区（其中三区较严重）。南峰四个区的部分村庄。濮阳三个区的部分村庄。消丰全县六个区。卫河个别区的部分村庄。南乐五区九个村发现后即打下去，但已有五百多亩庄稼被吃掉。昆吾四个区大部。鄄城六个区。临泽一个区的部分村庄。高陵四个区部分村庄。曲河二个区有十几个村。滑县七区周围十余里。卫南某些地区（茌平四个区东阿八区）周围二十多方里。聊阳（新设县）一个区个别村庄。徐冀二个区部分村庄。共计二十三个县六十九个区（估计尚有某些地区未有报来）。有的已大部打下，有的正在扑打，有的已消灭光了，有的正在发展。虫类包括蝼蛄、钻心虫、枣八角，枣步曲、黏虫、夜盗虫、蛴螬、密虫、蝗虫、＠蝗，其中尤以黏虫、＠蝗为最厉害。几天之中，可将谷叶棒子叶吃光。寿张一区张庄、刘魁斋两村，开始信神观望，不组织群众扑打，不几天庄稼被吃掉三十五顷之多。东明只三八区发现，因县里当时正组织抢修黄河高村险工，未重视虫害，渐蔓延到一、二区的许多村庄，吃掉六百多亩庄稼。在此种虫害发生后，六专署于八月十三日发出指示，号召严防虫灾，并指出各地如发现虫灾，应马上组织力量限期消灭，不得稍有迟延，使灾区扩大，并须在组织群众力量扑杀害虫过程中，吸取经验，随时报告，以便广播。区党委于八月二十七日发出消除虫害保护秋苗的号召，接着行署八、九专署及有的地委、县委亦先后发出紧急捕虫指示和通知，冀鲁豫日报亦发出“尽一切努力消除虫害”的社论，号召各地领导机关的注意，有不少地区贯彻和发挥了一九四四年捕蝗的精神和经验，组织群众坚决扑打，便取得了迅速歼灭的成绩，打破了群众迷信观望、认为是“神虫”“越打越多”和不愿组织起来各顾各的落后观点，纠正了干部麻痹观望，借口“群众落后”“迷信”等荒谬说法。象阳谷一区分委会于发现虫子后，立即布置干部检查，马上领导群众捕扑下去。范县虽然领导打的早，在一区也有几个村吃光。茌平发现密虫，已打下去。徐冀八区娄营抢救了一千一百多亩。尚和三区分委会开始注意不够，被吃掉五十多亩，后来说服群众，抢救了八百多亩。另外××直属医院徐翼七队和训练班等机关学校，均在发现虫后，参加了灭虫运动，领导群众扑打，收了很大成绩。但有的领导机关和干部，对虫害麻痹观望动摇，群众迷信不动，自己束手无策。象寿张八月十七日发现少数虫子，到二十二日虫子就多了，到二十六日县里才下决心打，二十九日才推动起区干，到三十一日才普遍推动群众打。一区干部，当虫子爬到院里时，还在开会讨论别的工作，致虫害蔓延全县，损失虽以挽回。捕虫中已得到点滴经验：在宣传教育时，必须指出，今年的虫害是过去少数的害虫的繁衍，今天打死一个，就等于打死以后或明年的几百几千个，打破“天虫”“神虫”“越打越多”等无稽之谈。必要时先彻底消灭一片，保住苗，以奠定群众信心，提高群众情绪，再捕时就快了。秋苗保的好的地区，则是领导重视、干部亲自动手与组织群众扑打相结合，打虫热情才坚持了下去。各虫灾区除组织力量扑打外，在寿张刘魁斋群众，正进行锄草地犁草地。南峰三区正进行挖蛾扑蛾的工作，以防虫根遗害明年生产。"

    "content": "To Cultivate Thousands of Revolutionary Construction Talents\n  　North China University Officially Established\n    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China University Founding Ceremony was solemnly held on August 24th. In addition to the more than 2,000 faculty members and students of the school, guests included Comrades Xie Juezai, Lan Gongwu, Chen Jinkun, Qiao Mu, Zhou Yang, Xiao San, Huang Mo, and Tian Jian, as well as Mr. Li Junfu, director of the Chemistry Department of Henan University who had arrived from afar, along with a group of six people, the Shijiazhuang City Primary and Secondary School Teachers Association, students from city middle schools, the Shijiazhuang City Youth Committee, and visiting groups from the Daxing Yarn Factory. When Chairman Qian Junrui, the Academic Affairs Director, announced the opening of the meeting, he said: \"The thriving atmosphere of this conference symbolizes the victory of the revolutionary education cause under the victory of the people's revolutionary war.\" President Wu Yuzhang called on everyone to study Mao Zedong Thought diligently and explained the basic content of Mao Zedong Thought. He announced the school's policy, which is to absorb a large number of educated youth and train them through basic political education to become thousands of construction cadres for all aspects of the liberated areas. The entire school is divided into four departments: the first department is a short-term political training class; the second department is to train and improve the teachers of secondary schools; the third department is to train and improve the cadres of people's literature and art; the fourth department is a research department, including advanced research groups for various specialized subjects, to cultivate teachers for universities. Finally, Wu Lao encouraged everyone with the four words \"loyalty, trustworthiness, faith, and sincerity.\" Amid cheerful music, students from each department presented gifts and paid respects to their alma mater. Comrade Xie Juezai called on everyone to combine study with practice and establish a revolutionary outlook on life that serves the people. Mr. Lan Gongwu proposed that North China University should undertake the task of \"transforming knowledge and transforming thought – that is, the ideological revolution and the knowledge revolution.\" Comrade Zhou Yang pointed out in his speech: \"North China University is a university for studying politics, a university for studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Politics must be studied as a science, and at the same time, politics must become the flesh and blood of life. If a person does not strive to understand the actual situation among the masses, is unwilling or unable to observe problems and study problems from the interests of the masses, he will never understand politics.\" The famous jurist Mr. Chen Jinkun pointed out: The contrast between universities in the liberated areas and universities in the KMT-controlled areas is like comparing heaven and hell, so he called on everyone to consciously complete their study tasks. Mr. Li Junfu, director of the Chemistry Department of Henan University, talked about his impressions of the liberated areas, and said with great emotion: \"Just as the Chiang bandits were indiscriminately bombing innocent people in Kaifeng, seventy-nine of us escaped from Kaifeng to contact the People's Liberation Army. They vacated the trucks that were transporting artillery and ammunition and said: 'We would rather not have the artillery than send you to a safe area.'\" Finally, he talked about his feelings about participating in the ceremony and said: \"The students here are living a free and happy life; but the students in the KMT-controlled areas are suffering persecution and hunger. They are expecting you to liberate them. I hope that all the people in the liberated areas should shoulder the responsibility of liberating the compatriots who are still suffering in the KMT-controlled areas!\" Comrade Ai Siqi spoke on behalf of the faculty and staff, and put forward two points, \"unity\" and \"study,\" to encourage everyone. Finally, student representative Yang Li resolutely stated on behalf of all the students: We will unite closely under the banner of Mao Zedong and study hard, and complete our tasks under the leadership of the North China Bureau and the North China Government, and Presidents Wu, Fan, and Cheng, and all the leaders. At the conference, President Cheng awarded graduation certificates to the first and second classes of the first department and the second, third, fourth, and fifth classes of the former Peking University College of Arts and Education. The entire conference lasted for four days. At the same time as the conference, a North China University founding exhibition, ball games, dramas, music, film evenings, and other events were held, featuring programs such as \"March of Democratic Youth\" and \"Chiye River.\" Finally, the conference passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De to pay tribute.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 培养成千万革命建设人才　华北大学正式成立\n\n1948-09-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　培养成千万革命建设人才\n  　华北大学正式成立\n    【本报讯】华北大学成立典礼大会已于八月廿四日隆重举行。到会者除该校全体教职学员二千余人外，来宾有谢觉哉、蓝公武、陈瑾琨、乔木、周扬、萧三、荒煤、田间等同志，新从远道而来的河南大学化学系主任李俊甫等一行六人及石家庄市中小学教联会，市中同学、石市青委会，大兴纱厂等参观团等。主席钱俊瑞教务长宣布开会时说：“大会这种兴旺气象，象征着在人民革命战争的胜利之下革命教育事业的胜利。”吴玉章校长号召大家努力学习毛泽东思想，并阐明毛泽东思想的基本内容。他宣布了学校的方针，是吸收大量的知识青年，经过基本的政治教育培养成千成万的为解放区各方面的建设干部。全校分设四部，第一部是短期政治训练班性质；第二部是训练和提高中等学校的师资；第三部是训练和提高人民文艺的干部；第四部为研究部，包括各项专门学问的高级研究组，培养大学校的师资。吴老最后以“忠诚信笃”四字勖勉大家，在欢快的乐声中，各部同学向母校献礼致敬。谢觉哉同志号召大家学习要与实际结合，建立为人民服务的革命人生观。蓝公武先生提出今后华北大学应负起“改造学问、改造思想——也就是思想革命学问革命的任务。”周扬同志讲话指出：“华北大学是个学政治的大学，是学习马列主义毛泽东思想的大学。政治必须当作科学来学习，同时政治必须成为生活的血肉。一个人如果不努力去了解群众中的实际情况，不愿意或不善于从群众的利益去观察问题，研究问题，他是永远不会懂得政治的。”名法学家陈瑾琨先生指出：在解放区大学里和蒋管区大学对比，恰是一个天堂，一个地狱，因此他号召大家完全自觉的完成自己的学习任务。河大化学系主任李俊甫先生谈到对解放区的观感，很感动的说：“正当蒋匪在开封滥施轰炸无辜人民的时候，我们七十九个人从开封逃出来向解放军接洽，他们就把正在运送大炮军火的汽车誊了出来说：‘我们宁可不要大炮，也要把你们送到安全地区。’”最后他谈到参加典礼的感想说：“同学们在这里正过着自由幸福的生活；可是蒋管区学生正遭受迫害饥饿，他们正期望着你们去解放他们，我希望全解放区的人们应该担负起解放还在蒋管区受苦难的同胞的责任！”艾思奇同志代表教职员讲话，提出“团结”“学习”二点勉励大家。最后学员代表杨犁代表全体同学坚决表示：紧密的团结在毛泽东旗帜下努力学习，在华北局与华北政府，在吴、范、成三校长和各首长的领导下完成我们的任务。大会并由成校长颁发第一部第一、二班及前北大文教学院二、三、四、五班毕业证书。大会全程历时四天，与大会同时，连日并举行华大成立展览会、球赛、戏剧、音乐、电影晚会等，演出“民主青年进行曲”，“赤叶河”等节目。大会最后通过向毛主席、朱德司令去电致敬。"

The statement suggested that the General Confederation of Agricultural Workers should demand the same subsidy for its workers, and expressed that the General Confederation of Labor would support all activities of government employees to obtain subsidies.

Workers should not be satisfied with obtaining this subsidy, but should unite to realize the basic demands of the working class. According to the Associated Press, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Frachon, said in a speech on the night of the 6th that obtaining the subsidy was the first victory in the working class's struggle for wage increases, but French workers will continue to fight to raise the minimum wage from 10,900 francs to 13,500 francs per month.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: US Labor Briefs: (1) The strike of nearly 30,000 dockworkers, which has paralyzed shipping operations at various Pacific ports in the United States, continues.

    "content": "Central Shanxi News\n\n　　Restoration of Saltpeter and Salt Industries in Yuci, Taigu, Qi, and Other Areas in Central Shanxi\n　　[Central Shanxi News] Saltpeter and salt factories and workshops in the newly liberated areas of Yuci, Taigu, and Qi counties in Central Shanxi have all resumed operation with the support of the democratic government. Over two thousand workers are working hard to produce for military and civilian needs. Before and after the \"July 7th\" Incident, boiling saltpeter and cooking salt was one of the important sideline occupations for the people of Central Shanxi. The saltpeter and salt produced in Taigu, Qi, Xugou and other places could be sold outside the region in addition to supplying the local people. During Yan Xishan's rule, he inherited the Japanese military control methods, treating all saltpeter and salt as military supplies, monopolizing purchases, and restricting the development of saltpeter and salt. Saltpeter and salt workers in various places suffered greatly from exploitation. In Qi County, each saltpeter pot had to deliver 100 jin of pure saltpeter per month, but the price given by Yan's official price was 20,000 yuan per jin, which could only be exchanged for five or six liang of white flour. The workers had to work for Yan while going hungry. The workers could not make a living, so they tried to produce more salt and less saltpeter to earn wages to supplement their income, but they were also subjected to various exorbitant taxes and levies by Yan, and if they did not produce enough saltpeter, they would be beaten and punished. Therefore, many owners of saltpeter and salt factories buried their boilers and fled to the Taihang Mountains. After the liberation of the Central Shanxi Plain, the democratic government immediately helped the saltpeter workshop workers solve the problems of production materials and transportation and sales difficulties, and now they have all resumed work. There are two types of saltpeter workshops: worker partnerships and hired workers. The Saltpeter and Salt Bureau of the Taihang Second Military Sub-district recently sent people to Qi and Taigu counties to provide specific guidance. According to needs, the government issued loans of 7 million yuan to Taigu and Yuci counties to solve current difficulties, and set appropriate prices to help solve the problem of finished product sales. The Qi County Democratic Government is preparing to assist the Saltpeter Mine Bureau in establishing a saltpeter worker grain store to ensure the supply of grain to the saltpeter workers. The saltpeter workshop workers in Xugou heard about this and came to ask the democratic government for help. At present, many salt boiling workshops have been established in the Taigu and Qi County Saltpeter Mine Bureau, and special personnel have been sent to provide technical guidance to improve the quality of finished products. According to a survey by the Qi County Saltpeter Industry Association, each pot produces an average of 400 jin of saltpeter and more than 300 jin of salt per month. The total monthly output of saltpeter in the county can exceed 20,000 jin, and the net monthly income of the county can be around 200,000 jin of millet, with a monthly profit of 50 million yuan.\n　　　　　　　　　\n　　　　(Bing Ru)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋中榆、太、祁等地　硝盐业全部恢复\n冰如\n1948-09-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋中榆、太、祁等地\n  　硝盐业全部恢复\n    【晋中讯】晋中新解放区榆次、太谷、祁县等地硝盐工厂、作坊，经民主政府扶植，已全部复业。二千余工人正为军需民食而努力生产。“七七”事变前后，熬硝煮盐原为晋中人民重要副业之一，太谷、祁县、徐沟等地所产硝盐，除供给本地人民食用外，尚可外运。阎锡山统治时期，继承日寇军管统治办法，将所有硝盐全部当作军用品，统治采买，限制硝盐发展。各地硝盐工人备受压榨。祁县每口硝锅，每月得交一百斤净硝，但按阎匪官价给价，一斤硝二万元，只能干折五六两白面。工人们只得饿着肚皮给阎匪干活，工人们顾不住生活，想法多出盐，少出硝，挣工钱来补，但也遭到阎匪各种苛捐杂税的剥削，上不够硝，还得挨打受罚。因此，不少盐硝厂主人把锅炉埋了，逃亡到太行山里。晋中平原解放后，民主政府立即帮助硝坊工人解决生产资料以及运销困难，现已全部复工。硝坊有工人碰股和雇佣工人两种，太行二分区硝盐局日前又派人到祁县、太谷各地进行具体指导。政府根据需要，对太谷、榆次两县发放贷款七百万元，以解决当前困难，并订出适当价格，帮助解决成品销售问题。祁县民主政府准备协助硝矿局成立硝工粮店，保证硝工粮食供给。徐沟硝坊工人听说，都找来要求民主政府帮助。现太谷、祁县硝矿局，业已成立不少熬盐作坊，并已派专人作技术指导，以提高成品质量。据祁县硝业会调查，每口锅每月平均出硝四百斤，出盐三百余斤，总计全县每月出硝可超过两万斤，全县每月可净收小米二十万斤上下，每月可取利五千万元。  　　　　　　　　　\n　　　　（冰如）"

    "content": "The Joint Office of the Agricultural Bureaus of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Governments Calls for Universal Autumn Plowing to Prevent Insect Pests\n\n[This newspaper report] Everywhere is already placing importance on the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, and have made many preparations, and successively issued instructions. Currently, a movement is generally beginning to form in most areas. However, many areas still do not sufficiently emphasize autumn plowing and the organization of labor and livestock. For example, the statement from Central Hebei that \"areas without the habit of autumn plowing can carry it out with a focus\" is one such instance. To overcome this situation, the Agricultural Bureau of the Joint Office of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Governments is once again calling for carrying out autumn plowing with the strength used for spring plowing. Excerpts:\n\nThis year, our region has suffered widespread insect pests. Through vigorous capture efforts in various areas, a major disaster was averted, but still, relatively severe losses were incurred, and a great deal of labor was expended. Therefore, resisting insect disasters must start with prevention, and the most effective method of prevention is autumn plowing. After autumn plowing, insect eggs and pupae in the soil are turned up to the surface, and after freezing, sun exposure, and being eaten by birds, they can die, avoiding a disaster. In recent years, due to the impact of the war in our region, there has been a lack of labor, and autumn plowing has not been widespread. As a result, insect disasters occur every year. In particular, the erroneous struggle against middle peasants during the land reform in many areas last winter affected the stability of the masses' emotions, and a large amount of land was not autumn-plowed, becoming one of the reasons for this year's severe insect pests (of course, climate, humidity, etc., are also reasons). Moreover, in addition to preventing insect disasters, autumn plowing can also prevent some diseases, improve the soil, increase fertilizer efficiency, and conserve moisture, reducing the threat of drought next year. In order to prevent the fruits of next year's major production movement from being lost to insect pests, we must seize this year's autumn plowing and ensure that all cultivated land in the region is plowed at least once.\n\nIn order to successfully complete autumn plowing, autumn plowing, autumn harvesting, and wheat planting must be closely integrated. All possible forces must be organized to participate in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, each doing their best, to the greatest extent possible. Semi-auxiliary labor should be assigned to threshing, hulling grain, pushing millstones, etc. tasks that they can handle, so that able-bodied young and middle-aged labor and livestock can be freed up to carry out autumn plowing, achieving harvesting on one piece of land and plowing on another, plowing and planting as we go, without wasting a single unit of labor or livestock power.\n\nTo give the masses sufficient time for autumn plowing, all unnecessary meetings and work should be suspended, and even some necessary meetings and work should be postponed as much as possible, and official duties should be stopped or reduced as much as possible. For example, the Taiyue area has stipulated that official duties be suspended for one month (except for war service). Other areas are also preparing to determine the date of suspension based on the specific situation, depending on the length of time for autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and wheat planting. All government agencies, schools, and rear-area troops should organize a certain amount of labor and livestock power to help the masses with autumn plowing with the strength used for spring plowing and autumn harvesting, and the livestock of all state-owned enterprises should also be rented out to the masses for plowing as much as possible.\n\nAreas with serious insect disasters this year are mostly areas that had less autumn plowing in the past, which are also areas where autumn plowing is particularly important. These areas are, on the contrary, lacking in labor and livestock power, making autumn plowing the most difficult. Therefore, the organization of labor and livestock mutual aid must be strengthened, leadership must be strengthened, and in some plains, where farmers have the custom of hiring livestock from mountain areas to plow the land (some call it \"selling cattle hours\"), this custom should be organized, advocated, and promoted to all areas with labor and livestock power difficulties, regulating livestock from neighboring villages and regions, but it must be for a price, and both parties must be willing and mutually beneficial. Where possible, some of the livestock from rear-area government agencies and troops can be transferred to these areas with livestock power difficulties to ensure that universal autumn plowing can be carried out once.\n\nIn order to stabilize and improve farmers' production enthusiasm and carry out autumn plowing, villages where land reform has been completed should confirm ownership and issue land certificates. In villages where land reform has not been completed, the principle of \"whoever plants it harvests it\" announced this spring must be resolutely implemented during the autumn harvest, and it must be announced again. Many areas have announced the completion of land reform, confirming land rights, and have also announced \"whoever plants it harvests it\" in areas where it has not been completed. Southern Hebei, Taihang, and Taiyue have also announced that those who carry out pre-sowing land redistribution on already cultivated but not yet sown land will be compensated with a considerable price to the original cultivators. These measures are all conditions for ensuring the smooth completion of autumn plowing.\n\nBecause most areas have suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, diseases, and insect pests this year, and at the same time have the condition of abundant rainfall, we must seize the opportunity to lead the masses in planting wheat, expanding the wheat field area, increasing the summer harvest next year, and shortening the threat of spring famine. To this end, we must mobilize the masses to use the fertilizer accumulated this autumn as much as possible for wheat fields (and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer this winter and next spring for spring sowing). In areas without accumulated fertilizer or lacking seeds, the cooperative and production promotion agency should coordinate. On the other hand, to avoid yellow dwarf disease, variety replacement should be promoted in wheat planting; superior varieties should be promoted; and seed disinfection should be promoted: warm water soaking, mixing with alcohol, mixing with asphalt, and applying arsenic sulfide to prevent diseases and insect pests.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀两区政府联合办公处农业厅号召　普遍秋耕预防虫害\n\n1948-09-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀两区政府联合办公处农业厅号召\n  　普遍秋耕预防虫害\n    【本报讯】各地对秋收秋耕种麦已经重视，作了许多准备工作，并先后发出指示，目前一般地区，且已开始形成运动。但许多地区，对秋耕工作及劳畜力组织，仍然强调不够。如冀中提出：“无秋耕习惯的，可以有重点的进行，”即是一例。为克服这一情况，晋冀鲁豫与晋察冀两区政府联合办事处农业厅特再次号召以春耕的力量进行秋耕。略称：\n    今年我区普遭虫害，经各地大力捕捉，未成大灾，但仍遭到相当严重的损失，且花费劳力甚巨。因之，抗拒虫灾，必须从预防着手，而预防最有效的方法是秋耕。经过秋耕，地中虫卵、虫蛹等翻出地面，经冻、晒、鸟吃，即可死亡，避免成灾。几年来我区因战争影响，劳动力缺乏，秋耕不普遍，因之，虫灾每年发生。尤以去冬许多地区土改中错斗中农等偏向，影响群众情绪不稳，大量土地未进行秋耕，成为今年严重虫害的原因之一（当然气候、湿度等也是原因）。且秋耕的作用除预防虫灾外，并能防除部分病害，改良土壤，增加肥效，保存水分，减少明年旱灾威胁。为了明年大生产运动果实不为虫害而受损失，必须抓紧今年秋耕，保证全区耕地至少普耕一次。\n    为了秋耕的胜利完成，必须使秋耕秋收种麦紧密结合。必须组织一切可能动员的力量，参加秋收秋耕种麦，各尽其能，尽量使半辅劳力担任打场、掏谷、推碾磨………等他们所能担任的活，以便抽出青壮年整劳力及牲畜进行秋耕，做到收一片，耕一片，随种随耕，不浪费一个劳力，不浪费一个畜力。\n    为使群众有充分时间进行秋耕，暂停一切不必要的会议与工作，即使一些必要的会议与工作，也应尽可能的推后进行，并尽可能停止或减少勤务。如太岳已规定停止支差一月（战勤除外）。其他地区亦正在准备按具体情况，视秋收秋耕种麦的时间长短，定出停差日期，各机关学校后方部队，均应组织一定人畜力，以帮助春耕、秋收的力量帮助群众秋耕，各公营企业之牲口也应当尽可能的让群众雇用耕地。\n    今年虫灾严重的地区，多是过去秋耕少的地区，也就是秋耕特别重要的地区，这些地区反而劳畜力缺乏，秋耕最困难，因此，必须加强劳畜互助的组织，加强领导，有些平原，农民曾有雇用山地牲口耕地习惯的（有的叫卖牛晌），则应根据这一习惯，加以组织倡导，推广这一习惯到一切劳畜力困难的地区，调剂邻村邻区的牲口，但必须有代价，而且要双方自愿两利。在可能条件下，可调动一部分后方机关部队的牲畜到这些畜力困难的地方，以保证能普遍秋耕一次。\n    为了稳定与提高农民生产情绪，进行秋耕，土改完成的村庄，确定所有权，发给土地证。土改未完成之村，在秋收中要坚决执行今春宣布的谁种谁收，并再次宣布谁种谁收。现许多地区均已先后宣布土改完成，确定地权，也宣布了未完成的地区谁种谁收，冀南、太行、太岳并宣布在已耕未种前进行抽补者，给原耕地人以相当代价的补偿，这些措施都是保证顺利完成秋耕的条件。\n    因为今年大部地区遭受水旱病虫等灾，同时又有雨量充足的条件，我们必须抓紧领导群众种麦，扩大麦田面积，增加明年夏收，缩短春荒威胁。为此，必须动员群众，将今秋所积之肥料，尽量用于麦地（今冬、明春再大量积肥用于春播）。没有积肥的，及种子缺乏等地区，应由合作社及生产推进社调剂。另方面，为避免黄黑疸，在种麦中应提倡换种；推广优良品种；提倡种子消毒：温汤浸种，拌酒，拌柏油，上信石（砷）等防除病虫等害。"

For example, when the Jiankang Brigade was stationed in ××, it needed more than 30,000 jin of millet per month. The Grain Bureau had about 50,000 to 60,000 jin of public grain stored in the village. A few days ago, the Grain Bureau mobilized a large number of laborers to transport the grain away. The Jiankang Brigade repeatedly requested that the public grain in the village be allocated to them to avoid wasting manpower on round-trip transportation, but the Grain Bureau emphasized unified allocation. As a result, the public grain was transported away, and the day after it was transported away, for some unknown reason, the originally transported grain was sent back. At this time of the autumn harvest season, when the masses are busy preparing for the autumn harvest and planting wheat, this round-trip transportation makes the masses very dissatisfied, and they are saying all sorts of strange things. This phenomenon of needlessly wasting manpower is the result of bureaucratic work style.

    "content": "(Jilu Yu Electric) Currently, Juancheng County is facing a severe famine and insect plague. The County Committee has specifically decided that disaster relief and preparations for planting wheat are the central tasks. Due to enemy destruction and \"leftist\" errors in our policy implementation, Juancheng has experienced a reduction in manpower and livestock, resulting in more than 300 hectares of abandoned land. Although cadres throughout the county led the masses in rushing to plant autumn seedlings, 11,181 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, but many planted areas cannot be hoeed due to continuous autumn rains. Weeds are rampant, and seedlings are only five or six inches high, so the amount of wasteland has actually increased compared to before. Not only that, but severe insect infestations have been discovered in the second, third, fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth districts, causing insect plagues. The masses in Juancheng are therefore experiencing great difficulties in their lives, and some are preparing to flee the famine. In this serious situation, the County Committee convened a meeting of activists from across the county on August 25 to discuss emergency rescue measures. The County Committee first pointed out that the disaster situation is developing, and it is necessary to resolutely overcome the erroneous thinking of some cadres who do not care about the suffering of the masses, and called on every comrade to actively lead the masses to eliminate disasters, overcome difficulties, and strive to plant all wheat this year. The following decisions were made at the meeting: (1) Cadres must personally organize, mobilize, and lead the masses to quickly weed and strive for a good harvest of late seedlings. If the seedlings are truly unusable, they can be removed immediately to cultivate the land and prepare for planting wheat. (2) Mobilize the masses to work together to catch and kill black insects. The methods are: 1. Manually catch them row by row; 2. Sprinkle soot from the bottom of pots on autumn seedlings in the morning to prevent insects from eating the seedlings; 3. Dig ditches to let the insects crawl into the ditches and quickly bury them. (3) Call on the masses to buy livestock together. First, dispel the masses' hesitation and unwillingness to buy, explaining that in the event of war, they can sell the livestock after planting wheat. (4) Investigate and collect statistics on how many households cannot solve the problem of wheat planting, and how much seed is needed, so that the government can help solve it as soon as possible. In addition to the above active production and disaster relief measures, the masses throughout the county are called upon to accumulate substitute foods, and cadres and staff of various agencies are to implement savings in preparation for the famine.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 灾荒严重威胁鄄城　县委领导灭荒种麦节约渡荒\n\n1948-09-15\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　灾荒严重威胁鄄城\n  　县委领导灭荒种麦节约渡荒\n    【冀鲁豫电】目前鄄城县正处在严重荒灾和虫灾威胁中。县委会特决定灭荒准备种麦为当前工作中心任务。鄄城因受敌人摧残及我在执行政策上左倾错误，以致人畜力减少，造成荒地三百余顷，虽经全县干部领导群众抢种秋苗，已灭荒一万一千一百八十一亩，但有许多已下种地区又因秋雨连绵不能锄地，野草丛生，苗高只五六寸，荒地反而较前增多。不仅如此，二、三、四、五、七、九六个区发现虫害相当严重，造成虫灾。鄄城群众因此甚感生活困难、有的准备逃荒。在此严重情况下，县委会特于八月二十五日召开全县活动分子大会，讨论紧急抢救措施。县委会首先指出目前灾情正在发展，要坚决克服部分干部中不关心群众疾苦的错误思想，并号召从现在起，每个同志应积极领导群众消灭灾荒，克服困难，争取今年全部种上麦子。会上作出如下决定：（一）干部要亲自组织动员领导群众，赶快锄草，争取晚苗收成。如苗子真不成用，可除去立即耕地，准备种麦。（二）发动群众一齐下手捕灭黑虫，其办法：一、用手挨垄挨晾捕捉；二、早晨用锅底灰向秋苗上撒，制止虫吃秋苗；三、挖渠让虫爬到渠里赶快埋掉。（三）号召群众合伙买牲口。首先解除群众犹豫不愿买的思想顾虑，说明战争情况下，种完麦后可以卖。（四）调查统计无法解决种麦的户有多少，需要多少种子，政府可及早帮助解决。除以上积极生产救灾办法外，并号召全县群众积存代食品及各机关干部职员实行节约备荒。"

When classifying class status, there was a household where, at the start of the War of Resistance, there were two laborers. One went to Taiyuan as a foreman and did not participate in labor himself; the other participated in revolutionary work. In 1938, the household hired a long-term laborer, which only stopped during the land reform in 1947. This household has 18 mu of land and six people. Except for the one participating in the work, there are no laborers in the family. Can hiring a long-term laborer for ten years be considered a middle peasant? The masses say he relies entirely on exploiting labor to live; is it correct to classify him as a rich peasant?\n        2.  There is a martyr's family with no one left. The woman remarried and took away half of the property. Who should cultivate the remaining land? Is it considered abandoned land? The masses are discussing whether it is appropriate to leave it to a close relative of the martyr's family to cultivate, in honor of the warrior's merits. How should the houses and movable property be handled?\n        3.  In six villages including Sitou Village in Pingshun County, there is a large temple that was transferred to the county's public property last year. The masses lack housing and are requesting distribution. Can it be returned to the masses?\n        (Yang Haizhong, Wang Tianfu, Pei Chengsuo)\n    Answer: (1) This household has six people and 18 mu of land. There are two laborers, one working as a foreman outside (the foreman's income cannot be considered feudal exploitation) and one participating in revolutionary work outside. Because there is no labor force, they hire workers to cultivate the land, which should not be considered exploitation. At the same time, the land averages only three mu per person, which is probably at the level of a general middle peasant. Therefore, this household is not a landlord or rich peasant, but a middle peasant.\n    (2) The martyr's merits should be commemorated and praised by the government, but since there is no one left in the family, if the deceased has legal heirs, their land, houses, and movable property can be inherited by their heirs. Otherwise, the masses should discuss how to handle it, and it is best to use it for village public welfare.\n    (3) Larger temple buildings, especially places of historical interest, should be handled by the county or higher-level government.\n    　　　　　　　　(Editor)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 烈士家中无人　财产如何处理？\n\n1948-09-15\n第2版()\n专栏：答复与问询\n\n　　烈士家中无人\n  　财产如何处理？编辑同志：\n    有几个弄不清的问题，请答复：\n    一、划阶级中有一户，抗战开始，家中有两个劳力，一个到太原当工头，自己不参加劳动；一个参加了革命工作，家中在二十七年雇长工一个，到四六年土改才停止了。这一户有十八亩土地，六口人，除参加工作的，家里没有劳力。雇长工十年能否算中农？群众说他全靠剥削劳力生活；是富农成份对不对？\n    二、有一户烈属，家没别人；女人改嫁带走一半财产，留下的地该归谁种？是否算绝户地？群众讨论为了战士功绩，给他亲本家留下耕种，是否合适呢？房屋浮财等如何解决？\n    三、平顺县寺头等六个村伙有一个大庙，去年归了县公产，群众缺房屋住，要求分配是否能归群众？\n    （杨海忠、王天福、裴成锁）\n    答：（一）这户六口人十八亩地，有两个劳动力，一个在外当工头（工头收入不能算是封建剥削），一个在外参加革命工作，因无劳力而雇工耕种，不得认为是剥削行为。同时土地平均仅三亩，可能在一般中农水平，故该户不是地主富农，而是中农。\n    （二）烈士的功绩应由政府纪念表扬，但家中已无人，本人如有法定继承人，其土地房屋浮财可由其继承者继承，否则应让群众讨论处理，最好作为村公益事业之用。\n    （三）较大的庙房，尤其是名胜古迹，应由县或县以上政府处理。\n    　　　　　　　　（编者）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th. The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened the heads of the four major systems' (military, political, Party-masses, and finance-economics) study committees on August 20th to report on the progress of the past month's study and determine the study steps for the next four months.\n\nRegarding the future study steps, the preliminary plan for studying documents in the next four months is determined as follows: 1. General cadres should study the documents of the Prefectural Secretaries Meeting convened by the Northwest Bureau in July, the \"Extreme Democratization,\" \"Lack of Organizational Consciousness,\" \"Absolute Egalitarianism,\" \"Idealist Concepts,\" and \"Individualism\" sections of the Gutian Conference Resolution, and documents such as \"Opposing Liberalism,\" \"Rectifying Party Work Style,\" \"Decision on Strengthening Party Spirit,\" and \"How Soviet Organ Personnel Should Work\" in the first two months. In the latter two months, they should study \"Instructions on Land Reform and Party Rectification in 1948,\" \"Taking Agricultural Production in the Liberated Areas One Step Higher,\" \"Two Documents Analyzing Classes in 1933,\" Comrade Ren Bishi's \"Several Questions on Land Reform,\" and the Xinhua News Agency mailbox \"Questions and Answers on Agricultural Socialism.\" 2. In addition to studying and leading general cadres to study the above documents according to the above procedure, senior cadres should add \"Opposing Empiricism,\" \"Summary of the Second Year of the People's Liberation War and Tasks for the Third Year,\" \"The Complete Gutian Conference Resolution,\" and \"Decision on Unifying the Party's Leadership in Anti-Japanese Base Areas and Adjusting Relations Between Various Organizations\" in the first two months. In the latter two months, they should add Chairman Mao's \"Speech at the Cadre Meeting in Jin-Sui,\" \"Checking the Implementation of Resolutions is the Basic Method of Bolshevik Leaders,\" the Cominform's \"Resolution on the Situation of the Yugoslav Communist Party\" and the \"Decision of the CPC Central Committee on the Yugoslav Communist Party Issue,\" as well as the \"Study Instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,\" the \"Party Constitution,\" and the \"Report on Revising the Party Constitution.\" 3. Party member cadres with low levels of education should study the Party member textbook.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 11th. In some counties of Jin-Sui, the study has partially achieved practical results. For example, after studying the \"Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention,\" the Shenfu (parts of Shenmu and Fugu) County Security Brigade reviewed the serious mistakes of violating the Party's policies and infringing on industry and commerce when Gaojiabao in Shenfu was liberated last year, and recognized that this was undermining the Party's political influence and causing harm to the revolution. At the beginning of the army recruitment movement, the county-level organs of Lin County studied the army-building documents, creating a surge of Party member cadres taking the lead in joining the army in the county, and the county achieved the greatest results in army recruitment with fewer shortcomings in the border area. After studying \"Lenin on How Soviet Organ Personnel Should Work,\" the Shenfu Industry and Commerce Bureau has begun to correct the past phenomenon of not taking care of the difficulties of the masses and even losing their temper with the masses. At the beginning of the study movement in various places, education and criticism were carried out on various incorrect learning attitudes. For example, when the Shenfu Industry and Commerce Bureau Study Committee arranged the study of \"Lenin on How Soviet Organ Personnel Should Work,\" some people said: \"This is a foreign affair, and it has little to do with us.\" Some people said: \"I have been in the revolution for more than ten years, and I can work without studying. Why should I study it?\" The study methods have also been explored. For example, the Guoxian County Government initially gathered all the organ cadres to read the newspaper together every morning, but some could not understand it, some were unwilling to listen, and some dozed off; later, different methods were adopted according to different objects. Those with higher levels of education focused on self-study, while those with lower levels of education focused on studying culture and current affairs, which opened up the learning situation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北局召集四大系统学委会负责人　检查以往学习进度  确定今后学习步骤\n\n1948-09-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北局召集四大系统学委会负责人\n  　检查以往学习进度\n    确定今后学习步骤\n    【新华社西北十一日电】中共中央西北局于八月二十日召集军事、政治、党民、财经四大系统学委会负责人，汇报以往一个月的学习进度，确定今后四个月的学习步骤。\n    关于今后学习步骤，决定今后四个月学习文件的初步计划是：一、一般干部在前两个月应学习西北局于七月间召开的地书会议文件，古田会议决议中之“极端民主化”、“非组织意识”、“绝对平均主义”、“唯心观念”、“个人主义”几部分，与“反对自由主义”、“整顿党风”、“关于增强党性的决定”、“苏维埃机关人员如何工作”等文件。后两个月学习“一九四八年土改与整党指示”、“把解放区农业生产提高一步”、“一九三三年分析阶级的两个文件”、任弼时同志“关于土地改革中的几个问题”、新华社信箱“关于农业社会主义的问答”等文件。二、高级干部除按上述程序自己学习和领导一般干部学习上述文件外，前两月增加“反对经验主义”、“人民解放战争第二年总结与第三年任务”、“古田会议决议案全部”、“关于统一抗日根据地党的领导及调整各组织间关系的决定”。后两个月增加毛主席“在晋绥干部会议上的讲话”、“检查决议的执行是布尔塞维克领导者的基本方法”、“情报局关于南共状况的决议”与“中共中央关于南共问题的决议”及“中共东北中央局学习指示”，“党章”与“修改党章的报告”。三、文化程度低的党员干部，学习党员课本。\n    【新华社晋绥十一日电】晋绥有些县的学习，部分已收到联系实际的成效。如神府（神木府谷各一部）县保卫队学习“三大纪律八项注意”后，检查了去年解放神府高家堡时违犯党的政策侵犯工商业的严重错误，认识了这是破坏党的政治影响，给革命造成危害。临县县级机关在参军运动之初，学习了建军文件，造成该县党员干部带头参军的热潮，在边区内以该县参军成绩最大，缺点较少。神府工商局学习“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”后，过去不照顾群众困难、甚至随便向群众发脾气的现象已开始纠正。各地学习运动开展之初，曾对各种不正确学习态度进行了教育与批评。如神府工商局学委会布置学习“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”时，有的人说：“这是外国事情，与咱关系不大。”有人则说：“我革命十多年，不学习也能工作，学他干甚？”学习方法上也经过一番摸索。如崞县县政府最初每天早上集中全体机关干部一起读报，有的听不懂，有的不愿听，打瞌睡；后来按不同对象，采取不同办法，文化较高者着重自习；文化较低者则着重学习文化与时事，才打开学习局面。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "【Jinan News】Handan City cadres, during their July study sessions, with the exception of a portion of state-owned store cadres, implemented and adhered to the study plan and system. They also conducted ideological self-reflection and work reviews based on the Four Great Documents, discovering widespread and significant problems in the thinking and work of cadres.\n\n　　(1) Lack of organization and discipline. Many comrades violated organizational principles without realizing it, and did not recognize their mistakes when they made them. Some comrades knew it was wrong and deliberately did it. Regarding the implementation of resolutions, some said they would execute them in action, but disagreed in their minds. (If one disagrees with a superior's resolution, one can reserve their opinion, but must declare it to the superior. Before the superior changes the resolution, it must still be resolutely implemented. - Editor). For example, Section Chief × of the government's judicial section reflected on himself, belittling the higher-level organization, thinking that it would not be good if the city were placed under the leadership of the prefectural committee. ×× of the middle school only saw the shortcomings of the head of teaching, but not the merits, thus generating thoughts of disbelief and disrespect. They considered this to be a relationship between individuals, and did not recognize it as a relationship between the individual and the organization. (2) Unclear responsibilities, unclear division of labor, and lack of efficiency in work. This problem also existed within the municipal party committee itself. Until studying the documents, the relationship between the municipal party committee and the government was not well resolved. Problems could not be solved in a timely manner, and thorough inspections could not be carried out in a timely manner. (3) After party rectification, cadres were afraid of making mistakes and did not dare to move forward, believing that the more work they did, the more mistakes they would make, and that it was better to do less than more. This was especially true for some comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds. For example, a cadre reflected that after party rectification, his own background was not good, and others looked down on him and he could not get along. He was suspicious and did not feel at ease in his work, holding a \"monk-like\" attitude. (4) Some comrades who had been punished were constantly planning for their punishment after the correction of errors, making noise everywhere, complaining about the leadership, and even some individuals used their punishment as an excuse to resist work, demanding that they would not work unless the punishment was revised. Some said: The conclusion made by the leadership on me is unreasonable, so I cannot work and study with peace of mind. (5) Some cadres with family difficulties requested solutions to personal debts and children's issues. Because these problems were not easy to solve, they affected their emotions, and they were unwilling to study or even work. (6) There was a general lack of dedication and responsibility in work, especially in schools. Many teachers adopted a perfunctory attitude toward teaching, preparing lessons without preparation or research, and casually compiling teaching materials. In managing students, they often proceeded from likes and dislikes, and did not patiently educate and transform them. They did not try to overcome difficulties, and lacked a spirit of innovation.\n\n　　In studying the documents, due to a preliminary understanding of the basic spirit of the documents, reflecting on thoughts, and reviewing work, there were significant changes and improvements in the thinking and work of cadres. (1) Consciously exposed ideological problems, criticized erroneous thoughts, and improved ideological awareness and revolutionary responsibility, and enhanced the cadres' political enthusiasm. For example, ××× in the middle school developed a fear of death due to illness, was spiritually decadent, and did not want to do anything. He wanted to be a messenger, eating when he could eat and playing when he could play. He held the erroneous attitude of living one day less than three meals. After studying, he realized that this kind of thinking was wrong, and clarified that decadent thoughts are all political degeneration. ××× used to be unwilling to do teaching work, feeling that it was meaningless and had no future, and asked to do mass work. After studying, he settled down in his work. Some primary school teachers were previously dissatisfied with education work, believing that it had no status or future. Some suggested that their abilities were small and they would not be able to do it for long, so it was better to quit early and do business. After studying, their emotions generally stabilized. (2) Inspected and criticized the undisciplined and anarchic thinking of the staff of the organs, resolved the cadre disputes that occurred as a result, established or are establishing new systems, and clarified the responsibilities and authority of each person. At the city-wide cadre meeting, the municipal party committee put forward preliminary opinions on establishing systems in the future. Each unit, based on the general spirit, is researching and formulating various systems suitable to their situation. For example, the Industry and Commerce Bureau previously had chaotic work relationships that affected the unity of cadres. After studying, they divided labor and clarified authority. The municipal party committee organs formulated a new living system, and the administrative staff and odd-job personnel all carried out clear and specific divisions of labor, and delineated the scope of work. (3) Improved the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between cadres. (4) Eliminated the ideological concerns of cadres who had been \"cleansed\" and returned, and old intellectuals, and stabilized their working emotions. For example, ×××, who was sent to a middle school as a teacher after being struggled against, is willing to serve the people wholeheartedly after studying, and has recently become more active in his work. ×× said: \"The government has opened up a path for me, and I am very willing to serve the people.\" He was unwilling to approach people when he first came, and dared not speak at meetings. After studying, he became bolder in speaking and also approached people. (What kind of cadres were cleansed, why were they cleansed, should they have been cleansed, and why were they cleansed and then returned? ×× was unwilling to approach people and dared not speak at meetings. In addition to his ideological concerns, are there any shortcomings in leadership methods and work style? The above questions are worth further reflection. - Editor)\n\n　　The reasons for achieving these results in a month of study are mainly the following: (1) In-depth and repeated mobilization to break down ideological obstacles in learning. For example, the Municipal Party Committee convened a cadre meeting to conduct unified ideological mobilization and arrange study, and specifically pointed out the key points and purposes of the study. Then, each unit conducted deliberations in light of the actual situation of the department and formulated specific plans. For example, the Cultural and Education Department Study Branch emphasized that the importance of learning is to unify thoughts and organizations, concentrate efforts to strengthen combat effectiveness, and improve work efficiency. At the same time, it pointed out the bad phenomena of overcoming the separation of learning and work in the past, slack leadership, letting things go, and engaging in formalities without connecting with reality. (2) Starting from reality, different learning focuses and requirements are proposed for different objects. For example, the municipal government proposed that the section chief group focus on checking organizational concepts and the accuracy, creativity, and bureaucratic style in their work. (3) The leadership sets an example and constantly discovers problems and corrects deviations in a timely manner. The cadres of the Industry and Commerce Bureau were initially not in high spirits. After inspection, it was found that the staff's thinking was mainly that they were afraid that the section chief would not inspect them if they did not feel they had a right to offer opinions. Later, the leaders made an inspection, and the staff felt that the problem could be solved, which improved the staff's enthusiasm for learning and the courage to offer opinions. Although there are the above achievements, there are still many shortcomings and deviations. Individual units have not started learning at all. Five of the six cadres in a state-owned store are still in a bad mood. Some units only checked some phenomena in their work and have not yet traced the root causes of their thinking. Comrades with low cultural levels tend to engage in terminology (for comrades with low cultural levels, a more teaching-based approach should be adopted to explain difficult terminology. - Editor). Some cadres still have ideological concerns and dare not boldly reflect on themselves and criticize others. The leadership still lacks regular and timely inspection, timely discovery of problems and solutions to problems, and exchange of experiences. These shortcomings and deviations need to be overcome and continuously improved in future studies.\n\n　　　(Propaganda Department of Handan Municipal Party Committee)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯市干部坚持学习制度　批判错误思想克服无政府现象提高工作\n\n1948-09-15\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邯市干部坚持学习制度\n  　批判错误思想克服无政府现象提高工作\n    【冀南讯】邯郸市干部在七月份的学习中，除一部分公营商店干部外，各机关部门都执行与坚持了学习计划和学习制度，并根据四大文件进行了思想反省和工作检讨，发现了干部思想和工作上存在着普遍而繁重的问题。\n    （一）缺乏组织性和纪律性。许多同志违犯了组织原则自己不觉悟，犯了错误不认识错误。有些同志知道是错误故意去犯。在执行决议上有人说行动上执行，思想上不同意（对上级决议，思想上不同意，可以保留，但必须向上级声明，在上级改变该决议之前，仍须坚决执行。——编者）。如政府司法科×科长反省自己，轻视上级组织，认为该市划给地委领导不会好。中学××对教导主任只看到毛病而不看忧点，因而产生不相信不尊重的思想。对此错误思想，还认为是人与人的关系，不承认是个人与组织的关系。（二）职权不清，分工不明，工作缺乏效率。这个问题在市委本身也存在，直到学习文件市委与政府的关系未很好解决，工作上不能及时解决问题，不能及时深入检查。（三）整党后怕犯错误不敢前进，认为作的工作多犯的错误多，多一事不如少一事。特别是一些地富出身的同志更甚。如某干部自己反省认为整党后自己成份不好别人看不起吃不开，怀疑多，不安心工作、抱着“当和尚”的态度。（四）一些受处分的同志在纠偏之后天天为处分作打算，到处乱吵吵，埋怨领导，甚至个别同志拿受处分作为抵当工作的借口，提出不修改处分就不工作。有的说：领导上对我作的结论不通，因此不能安心工作和学习。（五）个别家庭有困难的干部，要求解决个人的债务和小孩等问题，这些问题因为不易解决，就影响了情绪，不愿学习甚至不作工作。（六）工作上普遍缺乏事业性和责任心，在学校中尤其严重。许多教员在教学问题上抱应付态度，上课无准备不研究，随随便便编教材。在管理学生上多从好恶出发，不耐心教育改造。有了困难不设法克服，无创造精神。\n    在学习文件中，由于初步领会了文件的基本精神，反省了思想，检查了工作，所以在干部思想及工作上都有显著的转变与改进。（一）自觉的暴露了思想问题，批判了错误思想，提高了思想觉悟与革命的责任心，提高了干部的政治情绪。如中学×××有病产生怕死思想，精神颓废啥也不想干，想当通讯员，得吃就吃得玩就玩。抱着过一天少三晌的错误态度。学习之后认识到这种思想是错误的，并明确了颓废思想都是政治上蜕化。×××过去不愿作教导工作，觉得没意思没前途，要求作群众工作。学习后工作安下心来。一些小学教员过去对教育工作不满，认为没地位没前途。有的提出自己能力小干不长，不如早些不干做买卖去。学习后一般的都安定了情绪。（二）检查批判了机关人员无纪律无政府状态的思想，解决了因此发生的干部纠纷问题，建立了或正在建立新的制度，明确了每个人的职责权限。市委在全市干部会议上提出今后建立制度的初步意见，各单位根据总的精神正在研究制订适合情况的各种制度。如工商局过去因工作关系混乱影响了干部团结，学习后进行了分工，明确了权限。市委机关制订了新的生活制度，事务勤杂人员都进行明确具体的分工，划定了工作范围。（三）改善了上下级之间与干部互相间的关系。（四）解除了曾经“清洗”又回来的干部与旧知识分子的思想顾虑，安定了他们的工作情绪。如被斗后到中学当教员的×××，学习后愿忠心为人民服务，最近工作也积极起来了。××说：“政府给自己开辟了一条道路，自己很愿为人民服务”。他刚来时不愿接近人，开会不敢发言，学习后说话也大胆了，也接近人了。（被清洗的是什么干部，为什么被清洗，该不该清洗，为什么被清洗了又回来。××不愿接近人，开会不敢发言，除他思想上有所顾虑外，在领导方法与作风上是否还有缺点。以上问题值得深入检讨。——编者）\n    在一个月的学习中，能获得这些成绩的原因，主要有以下几点：（一）深入的反复动员，打破学习中的思想障碍。如市委召开干部大会，进行统一的思想动员与布置学习，并具体指出学习的重点与目的。然后各单位又结合部门实际情况进行酝酿，制定具体计划。如文教部门学习分会，强调说明学习的重要是为了思想统一与组织统一集中力量加强战斗力，提高工作效率。同时指出克服过去学习与工作分家，领导松懈自流抓不紧，和光搞名词不联系实际的不良现象。（二）从实际出发，对不同对象提出不同的学习重点和要求。如市政府在科长组提出着重检查组织观念与工作中的精确性、创造性，与官僚主义作风等问题。（三）领导上以身作则，并经常发现问题及时纠正偏向。工商局的干部开始情绪不高，经检查后发现科员的思想主要是见科长不检查怕自己提意见不顶事。后来领导上作了检查，科员都认为能解决问题，提高了科员的学习情绪和提意见的勇气。虽有以上成绩，但还存在许多缺点和偏向。个别单位学习根本没搞起来，某公营商店六个干部还有五个在闹情绪。有的单位只检查了工作中的一些现象，还没有追清思想根源。文化水平低的同志偏重搞名词（对文化水平低的同志，应多采取讲授方式，解释难懂名词。——编者）。有些干部思想上还有所顾虑，不敢大胆反省自己批评别人。领导上还缺乏经常及时的检查，及时发觉问题解决问题，交流经验。这些缺点与偏向，在今后学习中需要努力克服，继续改进。\n    　　　（邯郸市委宣传部）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: The Second Administrative Conference of the Northeast Administrative Committee was convened on July 21st and concluded on August 7th, lasting for 18 days. Those attending the meeting included the chairmen of nine provinces, namely Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Nenjiang, Liaoning, Liaobei, Hejiang, Andong, and Rehe; the directors of the Civil Affairs Departments of each province, the mayor of Harbin Special Municipality, the directors of the Social Bureaus, and the principal responsible persons of various departments, committees, institutes, and offices of the Political Committee, totaling several dozen people. The meeting successively discussed agricultural production, burden policies, organizational structures of governments at all levels, the election of people's representatives at the county and district levels and government committees at all levels, and the working style of the government. Finally, Chairman Lin Feng made a concluding report based on the discussions at the meeting.\n\nIn his report, Chairman Lin pointed out that the central task of the current government work is: production and construction, supporting the war, and elevating the production and construction of the Northeast Liberated Areas from the existing level. The report pointed out: The industrial construction in the Northeast Liberated Area has a relatively solid foundation. Therefore, restoring and developing industrial production is not only significant for the Northeast Liberation War, but also for the victory of the entire country. However, we cannot reduce the importance of agricultural production because of our attention to industrial production. Agricultural production must not be relaxed; developing agricultural production is as important as developing industrial production. Regarding agricultural production, Chairman Lin instructed: This winter, each province should hold a labor model conference to summarize this year's production experience, especially the experience of being organized; issue land deeds to determine land ownership; build water conservancy projects; select seeds; and eliminate insect pests. Each province should focus on establishing tractor farms to gain experience and train cadres. Existing tractor farms and state-owned farms should summarize experience and improve themselves. Agricultural loans should be used in a concentrated manner for repairing water conservancy projects, manufacturing and improving agricultural tools, and adjusting and improving seeds, and oppose purely relief-oriented viewpoints. Each province and county can establish agricultural experiment stations to improve varieties and establish horse farms to improve horse breeds.\n\nRegarding the issue of government organization, the report pointed out: In the past, due to concentrating efforts on military struggle and mass work, the organizational structures of governments at all levels were not yet sound. Now that land reform has been completed, building the government should be one of the most important tasks within a certain period after the autumn harvest. From now on, we should start trial elections; each province must conduct trial elections in several villages or one district. Before the autumn harvest, hold small-scale training classes; after the autumn harvest, hold large-scale training classes to concentrate village and district cadres and students to participate in the democratic election movement. The election of the three levels of county, district, and village must be completed before next spring plowing. The organizational structures and staffing of government agencies at all levels should be handled in accordance with the three principles of being lean, necessary, and focused. Oppose extravagance, formalism, and egalitarianism. Each province should conduct an organizational consolidation. To strengthen government work, each province should establish administrative cadre schools according to its needs and possible conditions. Regarding the relationship between government departments, there should be unified leadership and responsibility at each level. Except for railways, post and telecommunications, banks, and factories, mines, and power plants of the Ministry of Industry in various localities, which are still under vertical leadership, all departments of governments at all levels are under the direct unified leadership of governments at all levels. Governments at all levels must guarantee the implementation of work tasks, work plans, and various regulations at each level, and must not change the decisions of higher levels without authorization, or even withdraw funds or allocate grain without authorization. The Party must guarantee the implementation of government laws and decrees organizationally. Lower-level Party organizations should respect and implement the decisions and instructions of higher-level governments in the same way as they respect and implement the decisions and instructions of higher-level Party committees; and make Party members become models in abiding by government policies, laws, and decrees.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: In order to implement the decision of the Political Committee's Second Administrative Conference on completing the election of three-level governments at the county, district, and village levels after this autumn harvest and before next spring plowing, the Civil Affairs Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has not only instructed each province to organize trial election groups to select areas for trial elections, but also transferred cadres to form work teams to select villages with a good work foundation, complex social strata, a large population, and relatively mobilized masses to conduct trial election work in order to gain experience and promote the democratic election movement after the autumn harvest. Before their departure, the team spent a week studying the issue of building government.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北召开二次行政会议  林枫主席指出目前中心任务是生产支前  明年春耕以前完成县区村三级民主选举\n\n1948-09-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北召开二次行政会议\n    林枫主席指出目前中心任务是生产支前 \n    明年春耕以前完成县区村三级民主选举\n    【新华社东北十三日电】东北行政委员会第二次行政会议于七月二十一日召开，历时十八天，已于八月七日闭幕。出席会议者有松江、黑龙江、吉林、嫩江、辽宁、辽北、合江、安东、热河等九省主席，各省民政厅长、哈尔滨特别市市长、社会局长及政委会各部、会、院、处主要负责人等数十人。会上先后讨论了农业生产、负担政策、各级政权组织机构、县区人民代表及各级政府委员会的选举，政府工作作风等问题。最后由林枫主席根据会议讨论作出总结报告。\n    林主席报告中，指出目前政权工作的中心任务是：生产建设、支援战争，把东北解放区的生产建设由现有水平上提高一步。报告指出：东北解放区工业建设比较有基础，因此恢复与发展工业生产，不仅对东北的解放战争有意义，而且对全国胜利都有意义。但是不能因为注意工业生产，就减低了农业生产的重要性。农业生产决不能放松，发展农业生产与工业生产有同样重要意义。关于农业生产，林主席指示：今冬以省为单位举行劳模大会，总结今年的生产经验，特别是组织起来的经验；发地照，确定地权；兴水利，选种，除虫灾；以省为单位，有重点的举办拖拉机农场，取得经验，训练干部。已有的拖拉机农场、公营农场应总结经验，加以提高。农贷要集中使用，用在修水利、制造与改良农具、调剂与改良种籽等方面，反对单纯救济观点。每省每县都可设立农业试验场，以改良品种；设立马场以改良马种。\n    关于政权组织问题，报告指出：过去由于集中力量于军事斗争与群众工作，各级政权组织尚不健全。现在土改业已完成，秋收后在一定时期内应以建政为重要工作之一。从现在起就应开始试选工作，每个省必须试选几个村或一个区。秋收前办小规模的训练班，秋收后则办大规模的训练班集中村区干部及学生参加民主选举运动。在明年春耕前，要把县区村三级选举办完。各级政权机构及编制，应按照精干、需要和有重点三个原则办理。反对铺张、形式主义和平均主义。各省要进行一次组织上的整理。为加强政权工作，各省应根据需要与可能条件开办行政干部学校。关于政府各部门间的关系问题，应该统一领导，按级负责。除铁路、邮电、银行以及工业部在各地的工厂、矿山、电力厂等仍为垂直领导外，其他各级政府各部门，统归各级政府直接的统一领导。各级政府必须按级保证工作任务、工作计划与各种规定的执行，不能擅自改变上级的决定，甚至擅自提款、拨粮等等。党要在组织上保证政府法令的执行，下级党对上级政府的决定与指示，应该象对上级党委的决定与指示一样的予以尊重与执行；并要使党员成为遵守政府政策法令的模范。\n    【新华社东北十三日电】东北行政委员会民政部，为贯彻政委会二次行政会议关于今年秋收后至明年春耕前完成县、区、村三级政权选举的决定，除已指示各省组织试选小组，选择地区进行试选外，并抽调干部组成工作队，选择工作基础好和阶层复杂、人口众多、群众发动较好的村子进行试选工作，以取得经验，推动秋收后民主选举运动。该队于出发前以一周时间学习建政问题。"

    "content": "[Jinzhong News] In Jiexiu, under the tyrannical rule of the local tyrant Yan Xishan, many educators were treated as \"disguised\" elements, suffering all kinds of humiliation and abuse. Since the city's liberation, educators have been respected and cherished. Most young people have obtained ample opportunities to study freely. In the teachers' training courses for middle and primary schools, run by the democratic government, a middle school student from Jiexiu, Kang Yunqi, wrote in his record of observations on the democratic government's entry into the city: \"From July 17th, the people of Jiexiu truly tasted the flavor of democracy and freedom!\" After seven or eight days of short-term study, the teachers' desire to pursue progress was greatly encouraged. The teachers have been actively denouncing Yan's crimes. Cheng Xiangjiu, who taught at Jiexiu Middle School for two or three decades, said: The bandit Yan brought back his henchmen, such as the \"Comrades Association,\" from western Shanxi, treating intellectual youths who did not cooperate with the Japanese, Yan, special agents, and traitors as dissidents and anti-Yan factions. A primary school teacher in Zhanglan Town, because he refused to be bullied by Japanese invaders and traitors at Zhanglan Station, and taught near the border of the liberated area, was regarded as a \"disguised\" element by Yan's special agents, arrested, and tortured to force him to admit that he had relations with the Sacrifice League and the Eighth Route Army. Cheng Xiangjiu himself, because he refused to serve the enemy and opened a shop at home to make a living, was regarded by Yan's bandits as a \"Communist cultural element\" and an anti-Yan faction, and was arrested for investigation three times. He was detained in prison for fifty-eight days, and later escaped to the Taigu liberated area to live.\n\nMany educators in the urban area, after losing their land under Yan's \"soldier-farmer integration\" tyranny, had to rely solely on teaching for a living, but the education section chief of Yan's county government still had to \"eat two hairs\" (meaning bribes) from them. Li Xinmei and other teachers from the Central Primary School in Shuncheng Street said: Becoming a teacher does not depend on knowledge, but on connections. You have to send a stone of wheat to the enemy's education section chief before you can become a teacher. People with knowledge cannot become teachers, but the enemy county magistrate's two guards filled three teacher vacancies. Teachers had to assist enemy township cadres in urging the collection of grain and force the masses to pay grain for Yan's bandits in order to beg for grain from the township government, and the collected grain was sent to Taiyuan. The teachers could not be sure where their next meal would come from. Li Shiying, the principal of Zhanglan, wrote in his life memories: \"Since the 'soldier-farmer integration,' my wife and children at home could not live. My son and I went out to teach. In addition to teaching every day, we had to beg from door to door. We were in danger of running out of food every day, and we were extremely mentally distressed and our lives were miserable!\"\n\nYan's bandits' massacre of educators was especially cruel. In this year's \"political rescue\" movement in the first month, one-third of the more than 300 people were punished as \"disguised\" elements. A female teacher said: As long as a special agent targets you, you can't escape being beaten and humiliated. Guo Lixiang, a teacher in Yi'an, was driven to mental disorder by Yan's special agents, shouting and screaming in the middle of the night and jumping to his death. Teacher Sun Ziping was forced to jump into a toilet. Yan's bandits' tyranny has completely lost its deceptive effect from the personal experiences of people from all walks of life.

Last year, the village did not pay attention to seed selection when planting wheat, and because the planting was too late (according to experts, if wheat seeds do not emerge nine days after being planted, it means the planting was too late and the wheat will not grow well), wheat blight was very serious this summer. Out of the village's one hundred mu or so of wheat, only two mu were not blighted. Shi Xiaomao's six mu of wheat only yielded five dou. Labor hero Qi Baoze learned from this lesson. In addition to paying attention to seed selection, this year he paid special attention to leading the masses to plant wheat according to the season. This year, the White Dew fell on the sixth day of the eighth lunar month, so the wheat should be planted before the White Dew. Therefore, after hoeing the millet for the third time, Qi Baoze held a meeting with various mutual aid groups to discuss wheat planting. They unanimously recognized the benefits of early planting and formulated a specific wheat planting plan to plant wheat early. On August 23rd, led by group leader Chen Haitang and others, they began planting wheat. By September 5th, in twelve days, all 105 mu of old wheat land in the village had been planted. In terms of seed selection, in addition to exchanging some good wheat with each other, group leader Cheng De also went to Wangjiazhuang, Qin County, to exchange for more than five dou of wheat seeds, and other groups exchanged good wheat seeds on their own. Some people also used warm water to soak the seeds. Baoze also experimented with rubbing the wheat seeds with wine to ensure that they would not become moldy next year. Now, they are rushing to plant 25 mu of replanted wheat. The hemp fields have also been plowed twice, and can be planted within a day or two.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “八月白露麦靠前”　马庄劳英齐保则　领导全村赶种麦\n\n1948-09-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“八月白露麦靠前”\n  　马庄劳英齐保则\n  　领导全村赶种麦\n    【太岳电】“八月白露麦靠前，七月白露麦靠后”，屯留马庄劳动英雄齐保则领导全村，已将一百零五亩老麦地提前下种完毕。该村去年种麦没注意选种，又因种的太迟（据行家谈麦籽入土九天后上不来，就是种迟了，长不好），今夏麦霉很厉害。全村一百来亩麦子，只有二亩麦没霉。史小茂家六亩麦只打了五斗。劳动英雄齐保则，接受了这一教训，除注意选种外，今年特别注意领导群众按节令种麦。今年是阴历八月初六日白露，在白露前把麦种好。所以在锄完三遍谷后，齐保则就和各互助组开了个讨论种麦的会议，一致认识了早种有好处，订出具体种麦计划，提前种麦。八月二十三日，在组长陈海堂等带头下，就开始种麦，至九月五日为止，十二天已将全村一百零五亩老麦地全部下种。在选种上、除互相调换一部分好麦外，组长成德还到沁县王家庄换回五斗多麦籽，其他各组都各自调换下好麦种。有些人还用温汤浸种。保则还试验用酒搓麦种，以保证明年不生霉。现在，又赶种回茬麦二十五亩，葫麻茬地也已犁过两遍，一二日内即可下种。"

    "content": "Imam He Qikuan\n  　Introducing People's Representatives of North China, Part Two\n    Imam He Qikuan is a people's representative elected by representatives of the Hui people from various counties in southern Hebei, and was elected to the presidium of the North China People's Representative Conference. He is one of the most eye-catching representatives. He feels that attending this conference is a glory for the entire Hui people. He said, \"This time, the Hui people have separately elected seven representatives to participate in the conference, and there are also Hui people participating in the conference presidium. This is unprecedented in the history of the Hui people.\"\n\n    He praised the land reform, saying, \"Among the Hui people, landlords and rich peasants account for only two or three percent of the total population. Land reform is beneficial to the Hui people. During the land reform, the Han people distributed a lot of land to the Hui people. As a result, 60 percent of the Hui people in southern Hebei have risen to become middle peasants.\" He also expressed great appreciation for the CCP's policy of developing industry and commerce, saying, \"Most of the Hui people do small businesses. Small loans and the organization of cooperatives are very beneficial to them. The saltpeter tanning industry in Linqing has recovered a lot, and most of it is run by the Hui people.\" He said excitedly, \"We have always been called 'poor Hui people.' In the future, as long as we follow the Communist Party's policies and develop industry and commerce well, the Hui people will no longer be poor.\" In his capacity as a Hui representative, he suggested to the conference the establishment of a Hui Language Institute to train Hui teachers and the establishment of more Hui primary schools in various places to improve the knowledge of the Hui people and promote Hui culture.\n\n    He compared the different positions of the Hui people in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas with emotion, saying, \"In the liberated areas led by the Communist Party, the Hui people have obtained true ethnic equality. However, the Kuomintang oppressed the Hui people and tried to assimilate the Hui people. Chiang Kai-shek himself denied that the Hui people were a nation. Incidents of insulting and残害ing the Hui people occurred constantly in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas. In the past, there were large-scale massacres of Hui people in the Northwest. The 'Little Pig Bajie' case, which caused a sensation before the War of Resistance against Japan, was an example.\" (Note: Before the War of Resistance against Japan, the journal run by Kuomintang Railway Minister Zeng Zhongming published a novel insulting the Hui people called 'Little Pig Bajie,' which meant that the Hui people were descendants of Pig Bajie, so they did not eat pork, etc. This aroused opposition from Hui people in various places.)\n\n    Imam He felt honored that the Hui people in various parts of the liberated areas actively participated in the People's Liberation Army and enthusiastically supported the war in order to defend national equality, defend land and democratic rights. He said, \"In Zhangluji, Weixian County, which has a total of six or seven hundred Hui households, there are more than fifty revolutionary military families; and the number of Hui people who voluntarily participated in the war and carried stretchers in various places is countless.\" He was very satisfied with the freedom of religious belief in the liberated areas. Recently, he suggested building a祠堂 (ancestral hall) for Comrade Ma Benzhai, the Hui detachment leader (Ma was a Communist Party member who led the Hui people in various parts of North China to fight alongside the Han people during the War of Resistance Against Japan), to commemorate this banner of the liberation of the Hui people in North China and promote the heroism of the Hui people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 回民教长何其宽　华北人民代表介绍之二\n\n1948-09-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　回民教长何其宽\n  　华北人民代表介绍之二\n    何其宽教长是冀南各县回民代表推选的人民代表，并被选入华北人民代表大会主席团。他是最引人注目的代表之一。他感到这次出席大会是整个回民的光彩。他说：“回民这次单独选出代表七人参加大会，大会主席团还有回民参加，这在回族历史上是空前未有的。”\n    他赞扬土地改革说：“在回族中，地主富农占总人口不过百分之二或三，土地改革对回民有利。在土地改革中，汉人分给回民许多土地，冀南回民百分之六十因此上升为中农。”他对中共发展工商业政策也极表赞扬，他说：“回民大都做小买卖，小本贷款和组织合作社，对他们好处多。临清硝皮业恢复了不少，大部是回民开的。”他兴奋地说：“我们向来被人叫做‘穷回回’，今后只要照共产党方针好好发展工商业，回民就不穷了。”他并以回民代表资格，向大会建议成立回文学院，培养回民师资，各地多设回民小学，提高回民知识以发扬回族文化。\n    他感慨地将回民在解放区和国民党统治区所处的不同地位加以对比说：“在共产党领导的解放区，回民获得了真正的民族平等。而国民党却是压迫回民，力图同化回族的。蒋介石本人就否认回族是一个民族。蒋管区各地侮辱残害回民的事件不断发生，过去西北大量屠杀回民，抗战前轰动一时的‘小猪八戒’案（按：抗战前国民党铁道部长曾仲鸣办的刊物上，登着一篇污辱回民的小说叫‘小猪八戒’，意思是说回民是猪八戒的子孙，所以不吃猪肉等。引起各地回民的反对）就是例子。”\n    何教长对解放区内各地回民为保卫民族平等、保卫土地和民主权利，踊跃参加解放军和热情支援战争感到光荣。他说：“共有回民六七百户的威县张鲁集，就有五十多户革命军人家属；各地回民自愿参战抬担架的，更是不计其数。”他对解放区信教自由，甚为满意。最近他更建议给回民支队长马本斋同志建立祠堂（马是共产党员，抗战时期领导回民在华北各地与汉人并肩作战），以纪念这个华北回民解放的旗帜来发扬回民的英雄主义。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "(Taihang Telegram) A correspondent from our branch reports: The weeding and topdressing campaign, which is crucial for a good autumn harvest this year, has concluded successfully in the Taihang region. This campaign was launched amidst continuous attacks from drought, floods, pests, and the large-scale participation of labor forces from the first and second districts in the war effort. Considerable achievements have been made. According to reports from various areas, most autumn seedlings have been weeded two to three times. Wuxiang, which is close to the front lines, has also reached the usual level (three times of pulling, weeding, and harrowing). In Licheng, only 12% of autumn seedlings were weeded three times in 1946, but this year it reached 36%. Topdressing is also quite common: 40% of the local jade corn in Licheng was topdressed, and 66% of the Golden Queen jade corn was topdressed. All Golden Queen jade corn and \"811\" millet in Huguan were topdressed. In Xigou Village, led by Taihang's first-class labor hero Li Shunda, only 90% of the jade corn was topdressed last year. This year, not only was all the jade corn topdressed, but also some millet fields were topdressed. Autumn crops are lush and cultivation is meticulous in counties such as Heshun, Zuoquan, Wuxiang, Xiangyuan, Licheng, Changzhi, and Lucheng. If there are no natural disasters before the autumn harvest, a bumper harvest is expected. The key to the development of this movement is:\n\n(1) Based on the conference of the prefectural committee secretaries convened by the district party committee in May, each county quickly and correctly re-evaluated the local work foundation and the current demands of the masses, taking the correction of policies and the restoration and development of production as the working guidelines. They promptly stopped land reform and shifted the focus of work to the development of large-scale production, resolutely carrying out corrections, compensating wrongly criticized middle peasants, and resettling landlords and rich peasants. This stabilized social order and improved the production enthusiasm of all classes, which was a decisive factor in carrying out the weeding and topdressing campaign.\n\n(2) Party members and cadres actively took the lead. After distinguishing between right and wrong, merits and demerits, most party members and cadres understood that party rectification was to cure diseases and save people, and they were determined to make contributions in production. This gave the movement leadership. In Heshun, thanks to the active leadership of party members and cadres, the entire county completed three weedings despite very difficult labor conditions. Many village cadres were willing to endure some difficulties themselves, lending grain to help the masses overcome the summer famine, which aroused the enthusiasm of the masses for weeding. Many party members and cadres established new leadership styles in this work, overcoming the old work styles of coercion, commandism, and formalism. In Nanping, Pingle County, cadres checked weeding door-to-door, solved practical difficulties, and enlightened the masses. Xiang, the deputy secretary of Shili Village in Huguan, often used accounting commendation methods to educate party members and the masses, accurately planned more weeding and more fertilization, and promoted three weedings and universal topdressing (more than 16 loads per mu) in the whole village. In terms of leadership methods, the use of timely inspection and summarization, commendation and election of models, improved the labor enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and promoted the forward development of the movement. For example, the Second District of Neiqiu made full use of the radio station for encouragement and commendation.\n\n(3) Correct the mutual aid policy and correctly implement the principle of equal value and voluntary mutual aid. Various places have reorganized mutual aid groups in a guided and planned manner, improved the mutual aid interest of the masses, and greatly exerted the role of organization in the weeding and topdressing movement. After rectification, mutual aid groups in many villages in Licheng set wages according to the strength of labor and the level of technology, implemented personal scoring and work counting, truly exerted the role of mutual aid, improved labor efficiency, and made the weeding movement complete quickly.\n\n(4) A large number of organized women's auxiliary labor forces participated in weeding, overcoming labor difficulties and completing complex tasks such as summer harvesting, weeding, and participating in the war, which is also one of the main factors in completing the topdressing and weeding work. According to statistics from seventeen villages in nine counties including Yushe, Huguan, and Pingshun, 21,666 female laborers participated in agricultural labor in an organized manner, weeding more than 172,750 mu and harvesting more than 71,300 mu of wheat. In Yushe County, there were a total of 11,387 male laborers, and 33% participated in the Jinzhong Campaign for a month and a half, which was also the time when the wheat was yellow and the seedlings were large. They mobilized about 75% of the approximately 6,000 young and middle-aged women laborers to make up for this labor shortage and completed the weeding and summer harvest. Wuxiang organized women into several groups, each led by one or several male laborers, so as to provide guidance on the ground at any time. They not only completed the weeding, but also cooperated with male laborers to complete the weeding and harrowing. Various places have also gained some experience in resolving the contradictions between summer harvesting, weeding, and participating in the war. The main thing is to arrange life well, divide labor scientifically, and use labor reasonably.\n\n(5) Implement technical guidance. Shi Cunjin, the old hero of Huojiayao, Licheng, personally took charge of the technical committee, studied technology, promoted the whole village, showed everyone the \"811\" millet that he had weeded, and separated the good and bad styles in weeding so that they could learn from each other and check each other. In Pingshun, under the slogan of \"weed in drought, water in flood\", the technical committee of villages such as Xigou and Pielanyan studied the techniques of supporting seedlings and weeding (the local area suffered drought and hail in June and July), and promoted everyone to weed twice and apply topdressing.\n\nAt present, various places are summarizing weeding, carrying out the movement of cutting grass and accumulating fertilizer, and preparing to welcome the upcoming autumn harvest and autumn plowing movement.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行土改完成群众生产有劲　锄苗追肥成绩显著\n\n1948-09-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行土改完成群众生产有劲\n  　锄苗追肥成绩显著\n    【太行电】分社记者报导：对今年秋季收成好坏有决定意义的锄苗上追肥运动，在太行区已胜利结束。这一运动是在旱、水、虫等灾害的不断侵袭及一、二分区大批劳力参战的情况下普遍开展起来，并获得相当成绩。根据各地材料，秋苗大部锄二遍至三遍。接近前线的武乡亦达到往年水平（拔、锄、耧共三次）。黎城一九四六年全县只有百分之十二的秋苗锄过三遍，今年即达百分之三十六。追肥也相当普遍：黎城土玉茭有百分之四十上了追肥，金皇后玉茭上了追肥的占百分之六十六。壶关金皇后玉茭、“八一一”谷全部上了追肥。太行一等劳动英雄李顺达领导的西沟村，去年玉茭也只有百分之九十上追肥，今年不仅玉茭全部上了追肥，并有部分谷地也上了追肥。和顺、左权、武乡、襄垣、黎城、长治、潞城等县秋禾茂盛，耕作细致。如秋收前无天灾，丰收有望。这一运动的开展，其基本关键是：\n    （一）各县根据区党委五月召开的地委书记会议，以端正政策、恢复与发展生产为工作方针，迅速而正确的重新估计了当地的工作基础与当前群众的要求，及时停止土改，转向以开展大生产为工作中心。并坚决进行纠偏，补偿错斗中农与安置地富。稳定了社会秩序，提高了各阶层生产情绪，这对开展锄苗追肥运动是决定的因素。\n    （二）党员干部积极领导带头。大部党员干部经过辨别是非功过，明白了整党是治病救人后，即决心在生产中立功，这使运动有了领导。和顺由于党员干部的积极带头，全县虽然劳力十分困难，亦完成了三锄。不少村干情愿自己受些困难，借出粮食，帮助群众渡过夏荒，鼓起了群众锄苗的积极性。很多党员干部都在这段工作中树立了新的领导作风，克服了以往强迫命令、形式主义的旧作风。平定南坪干部挨门挨户检查锄苗，解决实际困难，打通群众思想。壶关十里村副支书向提水经常用算帐表扬的方法教育党员与群众，精确计划多锄多上肥，推动全村锄三遍，普上追肥（每亩合十六担多）。在领导方法上，运用了随时检查总结，表扬选举模范，提高了群众的劳动热忱与积极性，推进了运动的向前发展。如内邱二区充分利用广播台进行鼓励表扬。\n    （三）端正互助政策，正确执行等价自愿的互助原则。各地有领导有计划的整顿了互助组，提高了群众的互助兴趣，在追锄运动中，大大的发挥了组织起来的作用。黎城许多村庄的互助组经过整顿，按劳力强弱技术高低订工资，实行以人评分，以活计工，真正发挥了互助的作用，提高了劳动效率，使锄苗运动迅速完成。\n    （四）大批组织妇女辅助劳力参加锄苗，克服劳力困难，完成夏收、锄苗、参战等繁杂的任务，也是完成追肥锄苗工作的主要因素之一。据榆社、壶关、平顺等九个县十七个村的统计，有二万一千六百六十六个妇女劳力有组织的参加农业劳动，锄苗十七万二千七百五十余亩，割麦七万一千三百余亩。榆社全县共有一万一千三百八十七个男劳力，参加晋中战役的占百分之卅三，时间一个半月，又正是麦黄苗大的时候，他们即动员了约占整个青壮年妇女六千人中的百分之七十五的劳力，补起了这个劳力不足的窟窿，完成了拔苗夏收。武乡是把妇女组成若干小组，每组由一个或几个男劳力带领，以便到地里随时指导。他们不仅完成了拔苗，并配合男劳力完成了锄耧。在解决夏收、锄苗、参战的矛盾上，各地也都取得一些经验。主要是很好安排生活，科学分工，合理使用劳力。\n    （五）贯彻技术指导。黎城霍家窑老英雄石寸金亲自掌握技术委员会，研究技术，推动全村，把自己拔过的“八一一”谷让大家看，并在锄苗中把好坏把式夹开，以便互相学习，互相检查。平顺西沟、苤兰岩等村在“旱锄苗，涝浇园”口号下，技术委员会及时研究了扶苗、锄苗（当地在六、七月间曾遭旱雹等灾）的技术，推动大家锄了二遍，并上了追肥。\n    目前各地正在总结锄苗，开展割蒿积肥运动，准备迎接即将到来的秋收秋耕运动。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-16",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Taiyue Telegraph] A correspondent from our branch reported: In individual villages in Tunliu First District, because deviations have not been corrected, the masses do not know how to proceed with work after the autumn harvest, and cadres have abandoned leadership over production, so wheat planting is very sloppy. For example, in Xijia Village, some land was plowed once, and some was finished with plowing and planting at the same time. Very little fertilizer was applied; generally, only three to five dan of manure were applied per mu, and some applied only one or two bean cakes. From the start of sowing on August 23rd until it rained on the 1st, over 280 mu had already been planted, accounting for one-third of the village's wheat land. The reasons for this phenomenon are as follows: (1) Correction work has not been carried out; class status has not been determined in the village. Among the 40-odd households that were struggled against, only a few were rich peasants; the vast majority were middle peasants. Two of the households that were struggled against still do not have housing and are experiencing difficult living conditions. Therefore, the masses still have doubts about the policy, do not know how to proceed after the autumn harvest, and are afraid that if they plant, they will not be able to harvest, so even good land left uncultivated by rich peasants is not dared to be planted. Work in the village cannot be promoted either; in recent months, not only can mass meetings not be convened, but even cadre meetings cannot be held. (2) Cadres are passive and speak negatively, saying, \"Party rectification will eliminate administrative orders, making work difficult,\" and abandoning production leadership. Only the village chief and deputy village chief are still doing work, but because they are attending meetings and receiving training, they have not been able to focus on leading production. The production committee has not made specific plans or arrangements for the masses' wheat planting work; some military dependents lack seeds, fertilizer, and labor, and their problems are not being solved. It was not until the evening of September 1st that they made a self-criticism, stating that they would strengthen production leadership. (3) There is more land than labor in the village. The entire village has over 40 qing of land and over 150 households, with only 130 male full and semi-laborers. Each laborer has to cultivate over 30 mu of land. There are only 28 draft animals, and over 30 military dependent families need labor assistance. Last year, mutual aid teams were organized, but because wages were not settled, they have disbanded. Moreover, women have not been organized to work in the fields, so the labor shortage cannot be resolved. Based on this situation, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily publishes a short commentary today, calling on all regions to eliminate ideological obstacles in the Three Autumn Campaigns. It first states: According to recent reports, some masses in Yangcheng Fourth District are afraid of equal distribution after the autumn harvest and are not diligently collecting manure. Some middle peasants in Tunliu are afraid of requisitioning and compensation after the autumn harvest and are not diligently producing, saying that if they plant, they are afraid it will be requisitioned in the future. Middle peasants in Liangzhuang, Qinshui, are unwilling to apply more fertilizer, saying that they cannot guarantee who it will be distributed to after the autumn harvest. In Guo Daozhen, Qinyuan, some people even wrote letters asking, \"When will our district have equal distribution?\" These facts prove that because correction work has not been done well or has not been done at all in some places, coupled with poor publicity work, some of the masses still have great doubts about local land adjustments after the autumn harvest. They still have a knot in their hearts, which affects production work. This is a key issue that will determine whether our Three Autumn Campaigns can be carried out well and whether we can harvest more grain next summer, and it should be given sufficient attention. Secondly, it is stated that land reform in our district has been largely completed, and land rights have been largely determined. If adjustments are needed, only local or individual adjustments will be made after the autumn harvest, and there will never be another equal distribution, and the land and property of middle peasants will never be infringed upon. These things have been repeatedly announced. The current problem is how to publicize these policies to the masses. This requires using concrete facts to explain the policies and stating that these policies will never be changed after the autumn harvest. Wheat planting has already begun, and time is of the essence. We must quickly take effective measures to eliminate ideological obstacles in the Three Autumn Campaigns.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 屯留一区纠偏迟缓　群众种麦很马虎　必须迅速纠正偏向认真宣传政策\n\n1948-09-16\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　屯留一区纠偏迟缓\n  　群众种麦很马虎\n  　必须迅速纠正偏向认真宣传政策\n    【太岳电】分社记者报导：屯留一区个别村，因为偏向没纠正，群众不知秋后怎样干工作，干部放弃对生产的领导，所以麦子种的很潦草。如西贾村，一部分地犁了一遍，有的连犁带种一下就完了。上粪也很少，一般每亩只上三、五担粪，有的只上了一两个豆饼。八月二十三日开始下种到一日下雨以前，已经种好二百八十余亩，占全村麦地的三分之一。形成这种现象的原因有以下三个：（一）纠偏工作没有进行，村中没有划过成份，被斗的四十多户中，只有三几家是富农，绝大部分是中农，有两家被斗户现还没有房住，生活困难。因此群众对政策还有怀疑，不知秋后怎样干，怕种上收不上，以致富农荒下的好地没人敢种。该村工作也推不动，近几月来，不只群众会召集不起来，就是干部会也开不成。（二）干部消极，说二话：“整党要取消行政命令，工作不好干”，放弃生产领导。只有正副村长还作工作，但因开会受训，也没顾上领导生产。生产委员对群众的种麦工作，没有具体计划和布置，有些军属缺种子肥料，没有劳力，也得不到解决。直到九月一日晚上才作了检讨，要加强领导生产。（三）村中地多劳力少，全村共有四十多顷地，一百五十多户人家，只有男全半劳力一百三十人，每个劳力要种三十多亩地，只有二十八头能种地的牲口，有三十几家军属需要劳力帮助。去年组织了互助组，因没有清理工资，已经散了，又没有将妇女组织起来上地，这样劳力困难就解决不了。太岳新华日报根据这类情况，于本日发表短论，号召各地扫除三秋运动的思想障碍。首称：据近日报载阳城四区有少数群众怕秋后平分，不好好闹粪。屯留有些中农怕秋后抽补，不好好生产，说种上怕将来抽走。沁水梁庄中农不愿多上粪，说秋后还保不住分给谁。屯留西贾村群众因不知秋后怎样干，地犁一遍就马马虎虎将麦子种上了。沁源郭道镇更有人写信来问“我区何时平分？”………这些事实，证明因有些地方纠偏没作好或没有作，加上宣传工作太差劲，一部分群众对秋后局部调剂土地还有很大怀疑，他们胸中还积着一块心病，以致影响了生产工作。这是我们三秋运动能不能搞好，明年夏季能不能多收粮食的一个关键，应引起我们足够的重视。其次说明了我区土改已大体完成，地权已大体确定，如有需要调剂者，秋后只作局部调剂或个别调剂，绝不再来一次平分，绝不侵犯中农的土地财产……。这些已再三再四宣布了，目前的问题是如何将这些政策宣传到群众中去，这就要拿出具体事实来解释政策，说明这些政策秋后绝不变更。现在种麦已经开始，时间是一刻千金，要迅速采取有效的办法，扫除三秋运动的思想障碍。"

The workers were still working as usual in the machine room. Two or three hours later, they received the news of the Yan bandits' escape. But they still did not shut off the power. The generator was still rotating at the same speed as before. It was not until 12:00 AM that they rested. Because the house had holes, the machine room workers covered the machines with tarpaulins to prevent them from rusting in the rain. They slept in the machine room all night, never leaving their old partner of more than ten years – the generator. On the same day, some individual workers, deceived by the Yan bandit's propaganda and not understanding our Party's policies, secretly hid in villages near the city; the next day, after our army entered the city, with strict discipline and peaceful order, they especially protected the power plant, and they automatically returned to work. The next day, as before, they started the machines, supplying light to the whole city, and all the staff worked hard. The light bulbs damaged by the Yan bandits before they fled were all repaired and installed by the workers with tireless efforts, rain or shine. Sometimes, if a problem occurred somewhere, as long as a phone call was made, no matter how late it was, the workers would come immediately to fix it, not letting it affect the work. Boiler worker Liu Jinbao said, \"The boiler is my life, the factory is my home, how can I eat if I don't take good care of the machines!\" Machine worker Hu Xiuwen said, \"This machine and I have been old partners for thirteen years, it can't leave me, and I can't leave it. Now that our People's Liberation Army is here, I have never left the machine, even if I don't work during the day, I still have to come and see it.\" Then he excitedly said, \"When Yan Xishan was in power, we simply couldn't survive. Our People's Liberation Army is very concerned about us and treats us very well. We must work hard from now on.\"\n　　Although it has gone through two worlds, the machines of the electric company are still intact and working as usual.

    "content": "Healing the Wounds of Yan Bandit's Tyranny!\n  　A Wasteland in the Central Shanxi Plain\n    Democratic Government Intensifies Efforts to Help People Reclaim Land\n    [News from Central Shanxi] Under the \"soldier-peasant integration\" tyranny of the Yan bandits, the Central Shanxi Plain is filled with wasteland and barren seedlings, hunger, and death. In Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Wenshui, Jiaocheng, and Xugou counties alone, there are 200,000 mu of wasteland. The conscription of soldiers and laborers has led to a severe shortage of rural labor. Even the crops that were planted are indistinguishable from weeds, and the number of un-weeded barren seedlings is no less than that of wasteland. In Duancun Village in Jiaocheng District, the number of households has decreased from over 500 to only 368. More than 4,000 mu of land out of over 9,000 mu have been abandoned. For more than three years, the canals have not been repaired, and much of the irrigated land has become dry land. More than 100 households survive on wild vegetables and coarse chaff, and 86 people have already starved to death. After liberation, under the leadership of the democratic government, the village transferred 90 mu of green seedlings from the Yan bandit cooperative to poor families of military martyrs and workers. They collected Yan puppet materials and exchanged them for 2,000 jin of wheat, helping to solve the problem of food and seeds for more than 90 households, and organized more than 60 households to sell fruits and vegetables. The stationed organs helped with weeding and donated vegetable seeds, allowing the green seedlings mixed in with the weeds to grow. They also planted late crops on over 600 mu of wasteland. The \"soldier-peasant integration\" disrupted the original land relations, and those who were not of age could not receive any land. After liberation, it was announced that this tyranny would be abolished, and the issue of green seedlings is being actively handled by the leadership to help the original households and the current land cultivators to negotiate. In Renyan, Xiaoxiangzhai, Shangxiachijiazhuang and other four villages in Fenyang, there are a total of 9,550 mu of wasteland, accounting for 4.7 percent of the total land. After liberation, the county sent special personnel to lead, and organized labor teams from the mountains and other villages in the plain. Dozens of livestock were organized from the mountains, and three sheng of wheat were given for cultivating one mu. Together with the livestock in the village, more than 3,000 mu of autumn vegetables and late-harvest crops were rushed to be planted. There are still more than 6,000 mu, and a large number of women and children are being mobilized to pull up artemisia grass in preparation for planting wheat. (Qiao Huafu)\n    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 13th - The vast rural areas of the new Central Shanxi district are stepping up reclamation and plowing to restore production. Under the Yan bandit's \"soldier-peasant integration\" tyranny in the district, most of the land was barren, and half of the people were in famine. According to statistics from Fenyang, Wenshui, Xiaoyi, Jiaocheng, Xugou and other five counties, there are more than 200,000 mu of wasteland and more than 300,000 mu of autumn fields that have not been weeded. The Central Shanxi Second Special District Office (under the jurisdiction of Fenyang, Wenshui, Jiaocheng and other seven counties) issued an urgent instruction in the middle of last month: mobilize all military and civilian labor forces that can be used for production to reclaim wasteland and plow wheat fields to ensure that everyone in the new district sows one mu of wheat on time to survive the spring famine next year; county and district cadres and work groups should immediately go to the villages to organize production committees to lead the plowing of wasteland and wheat stubble fields, adjust land, and ensure that whoever plants it harvests it. At present, democratic governments in various places have organized many work groups to go deep into the countryside to lead production, mobilize women and children to rush to weed and plant, and solve difficulties such as food and seeds by using some of the captured materials and mobilizing the masses to help each other. Autumn crops have been generally weeded, and one-third of the wasteland has been reclaimed to plant late autumn crops.\n    [News from Central Shanxi] Last year in Shouyang County, under the rule of the Yan bandits, in addition to using \"self-confession and rebirth\" and \"slaughter and suppression\" to brutally kill innocent people, they also carried out arbitrary levies, conscription, and looting, resulting in sparse population and barren land in the countryside. Especially in the first and second districts, many people died due to hunger, cold, exhaustion, and lack of money for treatment. In Xigongyi Village alone, 91 people died within a few months. After this liberation, one often sees corpses buried in the rural areas, and many people are still struggling with diseases.\n    Due to the increase in the number of patients and the death rate, coupled with the Yan bandits' frantic conscription, good farmland is barren everywhere. Duangwang Village has a total of 2,200 mu of land, of which more than 900 mu are barren. Shuangjiaquan Village was turned into a no-man's land by the Yan bandits, and all the land was abandoned. In Luojiazhuang, Zhangjiazhuang and other areas, although the masses planted green seedlings due to the Yan bandits' looting when they fled, they were generally not weeded.\n    After this liberation, the masses have been crying out about the persecution they suffered from the Yan bandits. The masses in the second district said: \"That Yan Xishan, that beggar, robbed the common people of all their grain. Wheat was requisitioned when it was green, grain was robbed in June and July, grain was 'requisitioned' in August and September, it was transferred in October and November, and 'self-confession and rebirth' in December and January, and it was all gone by March.\"\n    In order to relieve the suffering of the masses, the Shouyang Democratic Government immediately issued an emergency notice, deciding to dispatch doctors from various places to concentrate in the first and second districts to treat the masses, and the County Medical Cooperative transported a batch of medicines to be sold on credit to the masses who could not afford the medicine. It also mobilized manpower and animal power in various districts to help cultivate the first and second districts. The county government has now allocated 6,500 jin of relief grain to the first and second districts to help farmers who have no food.

    "content": "Fighting to oust the Bandit Yan and Stir Up Production\n    Fenyang Masses Reclaim Land and Boil Alkali\n\n    [Jinzhong News] In Fenyang, the combination of land reclamation and alkali boiling has formed a movement, achieving great results. In thirty-one natural villages in the third, fifth, and eighth districts, 11,408 mu of wasteland was eliminated in four or five days, accounting for more than 52 percent of the wasteland area. In the process of land reclamation, the masses invented a method of boiling alkali using Korean artemisia, gray shrubs, and broom grass ash, which further promoted the land reclamation movement. Under the assistance of the democratic government, Renyan Village has established an alkali plant. When the masses reclaim land, they cut down the Korean artemisia, gray shrubs, and broom grass that are taller than a person in the wasteland, burn them into ash, and sell the ash to the alkali plant. Each jin of ash can be sold for six liang of wheat, and at least six jin of wheat can be exchanged per day. The alkali plant uses ash to boil alkali, with each pot yielding 160 to 210 jin, with an average of three jin of ash producing one jin of alkali. Each jin of alkali can earn a profit of two jin and fourteen liang of wheat. Influenced by Renyan Village, the masses in Ji Village, Da Village, and other nine villages have learned to boil alkali and converted the eighteen salt houses that were suspended under the rule of Bandit Yan into alkali plants, boiling hundreds of pots of alkali in nine days, with each pot yielding at least fifty jin, earning more than ten thousand jin of wheat. This greatly increased the number of people participating in land reclamation, grass cutting, and ash burning. Eighty-three people from Renyan, a natural village, participated. In Zhangjiabao in the third district and Renyan in the fifth district, two natural villages, two hundred and thirty-five women and children participated in land reclamation and production. Lu Dafu (poor peasant) from Zhangjiabao does everything from hoeing to cutting and carrying, and the masses call her a female labor hero.

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "【Taihang News】In Yan Village, Xiangyuan Third District, the wheat was planted late last year, and some of it didn't even turn yellow this summer. Coupled with the yellow dwarf and black rust diseases, most of the crops failed. On August 24th, the village held a meeting of cadres above the group leader level to discuss wheat planting. First, Branch Secretary Xu Haifang talked about the disadvantages of late planting affecting the harvest last year, and suggested that attention should be paid to seed selection this year to prevent yellow dwarf and black rust, and asked everyone to discuss it. Xu Liankui said, \"If you ask me, the wheat should be planted now. As the ancients often said: 'If it dew in the seventh month, it's over; if it dews in the eighth month, it's not over.' Isn't it the eighth month now? It should be planted now!\" Xu Qingchang said, \"Last year I planted a piece of wheat in Ya'ergou. When others were planting, we thought it was too early and waited for two days. Then it rained, and planting was delayed. When we harvested this summer, other people's early wheat was good, but our wheat had both yellow dwarf and black rust, and it only yielded a斗把多 per mu. This year, I prepared the land early and sent the manure to the field. I plan to plant it in half a day.\" Zhao Waniu said, \"Xu Zhongqi planted four mu of wheat early, and it grew very well. Early planting yields a harvest every year, while late planting depends on luck. In the past two years, whether it's autumn or summer, planting early is better.\" After discussion, everyone agreed to plant early, but also pointed out that early planting should not mean that manure is not applied to the fields. Finally, the branch secretary proposed: we must publicize to the masses to plant earlier, but don't delay planting. If the task of requisitioning stretchers comes, we will panic and not be able to plant wheat well. Each mutual aid group should plan adjustments and see which piece of land is prepared and has manure, and plant it first; if there is no manure, hurry up and haul it and prepare the land. After this meeting, the whole village started working, some hauling manure, some preparing the land, and those who were ready planted. According to statistics on August 30th, 182 mu had been planted.

He was elected as a member of the North China People's Government Committee in the conference election. He praised this conference as a glorious initiative in the history of Chinese democracy. In his closing speech at the conference, he believed that the conference had two major characteristics. He said: In the old democratic parliaments, all proposals were manipulated for the private interests of individuals and small groups, but in this conference, representatives made detailed discussions on important bills such as the North China People's Government Organization Outline, and seriously put forward amendments. Everyone ultimately followed the interests of the greatest number of people. This is a phenomenon that has never existed in the political history of old China. This is the first characteristic. He called the conference's receipt of more than 1,180 proposals, as well as the conference's serious review and handling of these proposals, the second characteristic of the conference. He said: Since the \"National Assembly\" since the second year of the Republic of China, it has never received genuine people's proposals, nor has it ever seen such careful treatment of proposals.\n\nMr. Lan Gongwu is from Wujiang, Jiangsu, and is 63 years old this year. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in Japan during the Xinhai Revolution, and served as a senator of the National Assembly in the second year of the Republic of China. Later, he engaged in journalism, serving as the president of the Beijing Guomin Gazette, director of the Chenbao newspaper, and editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Shishi Xinbao. After the twelfth year of the Republic of China, he once taught at Peking University. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he taught at China University in Beiping. Because he often published anti-Japanese remarks, he was finally arrested by the Japanese Kenpeitai Headquarters in 1939 and detained for one year. In the autumn of 1945, he went to the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberated Area while ill. He served as the Director of the Education Department of the Chahar Provincial Government and the Director of the Civil Education Department of the North Yue Administrative Office. When the reporter interviewed him, he spoke freely to the reporter about his feelings about working with the Communists in the Liberated Area. He said, \"The Communist Party has no secrets in its cause for the people. Whatever I ask, they tell me. Whatever I want to study, I can investigate. Similarly, I say whatever I have, without reservation. Many things that are not within my job scope, I criticize and suggest the same way if I have opinions.\" He also said: \"In the past, what we were doing was old democracy, so we could never do it well. Now that we have New Democracy and the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party, China has embarked on a bright road.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 无党派的老教授蓝公武　华北人民代表介绍之一\n\n1948-09-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　无党派的老教授蓝公武\n  　华北人民代表介绍之一\n    蓝公武先生是华北人民代表大会中无党派的民主人士，大会主席团之一，在大会选举中当选为华北人民政府委员。他盛赞此次大会为中国民主史上光荣的创举。他在大会闭幕词中，认为大会有两大特色，他说：在旧民主的议会中，议案全为个人与小集团的私利所操纵，但在这次大会中，对华北人民政府组织大纲等重要法案，代表们均作了详细讨论，严肃提出了修正案，大家最后都以最大多数人的利益为依归，这是旧中国政治史上所没有过的现象。这是第一个特色。他把大会收到一千一百八十多件提案，以及大会认真的审查与处理了这些提案，称为大会的第二个特色。他说：从民国二年以来的“国会”中，就从来没有收到过真正的人民的提案，也从未见如此审慎的对待提案。\n    蓝公武先生是江苏吴江人，今年六十三岁。辛亥时毕业于日本东京帝大，民国二年任国会参议员。以后从事新闻事业，历任北京国民公报社长、晨报董事、上海时事新报总编辑等职。民国十二年后，一度任教于北京大学。抗日战争中，他在北平中国大学任教，因经常发表反日言论，终于一九三九年为日本宪兵司令部逮捕，羁押一年。一九四五年秋，他抱病到了晋察冀解放区。曾任察哈尔省政府教育厅长和北岳行署民教厅长。当记者访问他时，他向记者畅谈在解放区与共产党人共事的感想。他说：“共产党在对人民事业上没有秘密，我问什么就告诉我什么，想研究什么就可以去调查什么。同样，我也有什么就说什么，毫无保留。许多不在我职务范围内的事情，我有意见也一样批评，一样建议。”他又说：“过去我们闹的是旧民主，所以总是闹不好。现在有了新民主主义，有了无产阶级和共产党的领导，中国就走上了光明大道。”"

After Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were brutally assassinated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, he was forced to come to the Liberated Areas at the end of 1946. He first taught at Shandong University and then transferred to the Research Office of North China University. He is currently a professor at North China University.\n\n　　When Mr. Shang talked to reporters about the situation of Shi Lei, a student of North China University, running for the representative of the people of North China, he said: Shi Lei is not a member of the Communist Party. In this election of more than 1,000 voters in Huabei University, he actually won the election and was elected as the representative of the people. This shows that there is true democracy only under the leadership of the Communist Party.

In last year's land reform, the interests of middle peasants were harmed, with 24 out of 42 households struggled against being middle peasants. In January of this year, a work team arrived in the village to carry out democratic rectification of the Party and made some corrections, but because the work was not thorough, the middle peasants still had doubts about the policy. Furthermore, the emphasis on returning the original items to the middle peasants also made the poor and hired peasants uneasy, as they thought what they had been allocated was not guaranteed. Everyone was unclear about the policy, and production enthusiasm was low. Houses were not repaired when they were damaged, and the land was not cultivated well. At the beginning of last month, the village branch and the People's Congress, in accordance with the spirit of the District Party Committee's May meeting, implemented the correction of errors, corrected wrongly determined class status, and separately returned and compensated wrongly accused middle peasants and settled landlords and rich peasants. Land, houses, livestock, farm tools, clothing, grain, etc., were all carefully compensated and adjusted. After the compensation, a village-wide unity meeting was held to explain the policy of ending land reform and turning to production, so that everyone understood that the land reform in the village had been thorough and that the future direction was to boldly develop production, with land ownership determined, free buying and selling, and each person's labor belonging to themselves. After this announcement and explanation, the masses had a clear understanding of the policy, and their doubts were dispelled. Yao Gejin said, \"If the policy is like this, I will cultivate my land well.\" Yao Zhangshan said, \"It won't work if it's like last winter (referring to the chaos after the establishment of poor and hired peasant groups), people would try to take away the land I worked hard for with my wheelbarrow, who would have the heart to work?\" Yao Qingyu, a middle peasant who was wrongly struggled against, said, \"My livestock was struggled against, but this time I was compensated, and I will buy a mule!\" The masses understood the Party's policy, and their enthusiasm for production has increased, and they have been buying livestock and opening workshops to vigorously develop production. In the past month, one new grain store, one flower workshop, and one meat workshop have been added. Twenty-seven new livestock have been added, including five bought by middle peasants who were compensated and had their class status changed. Twenty-two houses have been repaired, and even more new houses have been built. Mutual aid is now being reorganized in preparation for the autumn harvest.

    "content": "People's Voice\n\n　　Problems in the Work of Fujiazhuang, Xian County\n　　The County Party Committee Should Conduct a Review and Make Corrections\nTo the Editor:\n　　Upon reading the \"People's Voice\" section in the August 15th newspaper, our tears flowed! Our government and our common people are of one heart, so why is there a sense of distance between us? Now, this barrier has been broken through.\n　　I am a middle peasant who became well-off after the \"May 1st\" mopping-up operation in Central Hebei (referring to the large-scale \"mopping-up\" operation by the Japanese invaders in May 1942). I was very poor in the past. My family of three had only three mu of land and owed 50 yuan in debt. The policies of rent reduction and interest reduction halved the debt burden on me. Through years of labor by the whole family, I gradually accumulated some savings. From 1942 to 1947, I bought more than 12.9 mu of land, redeemed 7 mu of local land, and bought a weaving machine. I have not lent money at interest or hired long-term or short-term laborers. I have only owed money and worked for others. If it weren't for the new regime, I would not have been able to turn myself around. During the land redistribution last year, I was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant and was asked to contribute 7.7 mu of land, all of which was second-grade land (my good land). Later, the poor peasant association distributed part of it, and the rest was left uncultivated. I requested twice from the district to return it to me. The first time, the district agreed to return it, but then said it was not possible. Every time I walked to the edge of the land that I had just bought and cultivated for one season last year, I saw the weeds growing in the field, and my tears fell. I also went to the village cadres. Shao Fulin, the vice-chairman of the new peasant association, said: \"I am responsible for the wasteland; if others don't cultivate it, I will.\" I had to endure it, watching them not cultivating it at all, and the weeds growing more than a foot tall.\n　　Now I will talk about the land redistribution work in my village. At that time, the district cadres Li Shangmin and a comrade surnamed Ma were in charge. They removed all the cadres in my village, regardless of whether they were good or bad. No one who was not removed dared to speak. During the mass meeting, the district cadres pointed at the Communist Party members and said, \"None of you are good people.\" What kind of cadres did the district cadres use to manage the land redistribution? The real poor peasants and hired laborers were suppressed in the poor peasant association. Shao Fulin, Gong Fuquan, and others in charge were not long-term laborers or upright poor peasants and hired laborers. They only sought their own interests and did not implement the policies of the Communist Party. First, they determined our class status based on wealth and lifestyle. For example, Liu Yongfa, Gong Yongtang, Wang Dianfa, Liang Xiuqing, Wang Yuanshu, and others had never engaged in any exploitation, but they were all classified as rich peasants. The heads of households were detained, and they were begging for food outside before the wheat harvest. At the same time, they lowered the average land per capita in the whole village (the average was 4.5 mu per person, but they only calculated 3.8 mu). Anyone who exceeded the average was classified as a well-to-do middle peasant and was asked to contribute land. More than 80 households were asked to contribute land. Later, the district did not allow it and reduced it to more than 30 households, selecting good land from the land of those more than 30 households. Second, the distribution of confiscated property only satisfied the interests of a few cadres. Hearing that the wrongly classified status should be corrected, and the confiscated property from the middle peasants that had not been distributed should be returned, and the distributed property should be compensated for, they quickly distributed the confiscated property. There were also problems in the distribution of confiscated property. The poor peasants were divided into ten grades, and the fruits were valued at a price. When distributing, the desperately poor were allowed to choose first. If the value of the items chosen was greater than the money they were entitled to, they had to pay the difference. As a result, honest poor peasants and hired laborers were afraid of paying money and chose fewer items, only receiving some tattered furniture. However, cadres such as Shao Fulin, Gong Sanxing, and Gong Fuquan took more items without paying the difference. Shao Fulin took a cow and should have compensated 600,000 yuan, but he didn't. They only cared about having livestock and farm tools and good land. There were still more than 60 mu of land that had not been distributed, and they didn't care. But they reported to the higher authorities that the poor peasants disliked the land being bad and were unwilling to take it, and the middle peasants disliked the burden being heavy and were unwilling to cultivate the land. In fact, the poor peasants wanted to cultivate it, but they couldn't because they didn't have livestock and farm tools. The middle peasants were afraid of the burden because the burden distribution in our village last year was unfair. More than 80 households did not pay the burden. The method of paying the burden last year was to apply the government's progressive rate, and then divide the points into grades. The first grade was 63 jin, and the fourth grade was 18 jin. As a result, more than 80 households were exempt from tax. Those who paid heavily had to hand over all the grain harvested from the land and it was still not enough. Fighting the enemy at the front and producing and handing over public grain at the rear is an obligation. As long as it is fair and reasonable, we are not afraid of being heavy, and we will just step up production. In the past, we never complained about the burden being heavy, but it was just that the village handled it too unfairly. He concealed this situation from the higher authorities.\n　　Please send cadres from the higher authorities to investigate and deal with the problems in our village, and print Chairman Mao's policies into books and send them to the market for the people to voluntarily buy. Only when the people study Chairman Mao's policies can no one distort them. The government and the people are of one heart, but we people have not studied the policies and government decrees well, so we let bad people deceive those above and mislead those below, and do many bad things. I have recently read the newspaper and understand some things. I am writing this letter to you. Please reply.\n　　　　　　　　　　Liu Qingrui, Fujiazhuang, Eleventh District, Xian County\n\n　　Editor's Note: Based on the situation described by Liu Qingrui, the Xian County Party Committee should conduct an in-depth investigation of this village. If these are indeed the facts, then they are serious violations of the Party's policies. They should be corrected and dealt with in a timely manner, and a public response should be made!\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 献县富家庄工作有毛病　县委应作检查纠正\n刘庆瑞\n1948-09-16\n第1版()\n专栏：群众呼声\n\n　　献县富家庄工作有毛病\n  　县委应作检查纠正编辑同志：\n    看到八月十五日的报纸上的群众呼声，我们的热泪都下来了！咱们的政府和咱们老百姓本是一条心，为什么当中倒象有了隔膜呢？现在这隔膜算是打穿了。\n    我是一个中农，是在冀中“五一”扫荡（指一九四二年五月日寇大“扫荡”）以后才起了家的。我过去很穷，家里三口人，只有三亩地，还欠债五十元。减租减息的政策使压在我头上的债利轻了一半，全家长年劳动，慢慢有了一点积余，从一九四二年到一九四七年中，陆续买了十二亩九分多地，赎回了七亩当地，买了一架织布机。我没有放过债，也没雇长工短工，只是欠过债和给别人做过活，要不是新政权来我也翻不了身。去年平分时，说我是富裕中农，叫我出了七亩七分地，都是二等地（是我的好地）。以后给贫农团分了一部，余下的荒着没有人种，我向区上要求了两次，要求给我退回来。第一次区上已答应给退，可是以后又说不行；我每一走到我去年刚买进来才种了一季的地边上，看见地里长着草，难受的眼泪都掉了下来。我又找村干部，新农会副主任邵福林说：荒了我负责，别人不种我种。我只好忍着，看着他们一直没人种，长的草有一尺多长。\n    现在我谈谈我村的平分工作吧。当时是区上的干部栗尚敏和一个姓马的同志掌握的。把我村的干部不分好坏都搬掉，一个没有搬的人也不敢说话。在群众大会中叫共产党员站出来，区干部指着共产党员说：“你们没一个好东西。”区干部用什么干部来掌握平分呢？贫农团里真正的贫雇被压下，管事的邵福林巩福全等都不是长年劳动的为人正派的贫雇农，他们只替自己谋利益，不执行共产党的政策。第一、按富力按生活订咱们的成份。如刘永法、巩永堂、王殿法、梁秀卿、王元书等根本就没有过什么剥削，都定成了富农，户主被扣，在麦收前都在外要饭吃。同时把全村每人平均土地的数字压低（每人平均四亩半，他们只算三亩八），凡是超过平均数字的都定成富裕中农，都叫出地。出地户共八十多户，后区上不准，才减到三十多户，把三十多户的地选好地抽出。第二、分浮财只能满足干部少数人利益，听到说是错订了成份要改正，没收中农的东西没分的要退回，分了的要设法补偿，他们就很快的把浮财分了。分浮财中也有毛病，把贫农分为十等，果实折价，分时让赤贫先挑，如挑的东西价值大于应分的钱时，就得把钱拿出，结果老实的贫雇农怕出钱，就少要东西，只分得了些破烂家具。邵福林、巩三兴、巩福全等干部，却是多拿了东西而不拿出钱来。邵福林拉了牛，应补六十万元就没补。他们只顾他有了牲口农具，有了好地；还有六十多亩地没分下去，他们就不管了。但他们向上级报告说：贫农嫌地不好不愿要，中农嫌负担重也不愿种地。实际是贫农想种，因为没分得牲口农具种不了。中农怕负担，是因去年我村负担不公，不拿负担的就有八十多户。去年拿负担的办法是按照政府的累进率累进后，再把分数分成等级，第一等六十三斤，四等十八斤，结果八十多户免税。拿得重的把地里打下的粮食完全交上还不够。前方打敌人，后方生产交公粮，这是义务，只要公平合理，重也不怕，加紧生产就行。过去我们没有嫌过重，只是村里办得太不公平。这种情况他又隐瞒上级不告。\n    请上级派干部来调查处理我村的问题，并把毛主席的政策印成书本子，送到集上，让老百姓自愿的买下，只有老百姓学习了毛主席的政策，就谁也不能歪曲了。政府和老百姓本是一条心，只是咱老百姓没很好学习政策政府法令，就让坏人欺上瞒下，办了许多不好的事。我最近看了报纸，心里明白一些，我写这封信给你，请答复一下。\n  　　　　　　　　　　献县第十一区富家庄刘庆瑞上\n    编者按：根据刘庆瑞所述情况，献县县委对该村应作深入调查。这些若确属事实，则是严重的违反党的政策的现象。应及时纠正处理，并作公开答复！"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—According to various sources, the Kuomintang reactionary government is currently intensifying its efforts to annex all commercial banks and firms in its controlled areas, especially Shanghai, that are not part of the four major families. They are seizing the foreign currency and precious metals held by these firms. In Chiang Kai-shek's \"Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency,\" announced on August 19th, it was stipulated that only the puppet Central Bank and its authorized banks were allowed to exchange, hold, or safeguard gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency. Other banks and money shops were forbidden from doing so and were required to convert and deposit these assets with the puppet Central Bank. Commercial banks and firms recognized this as a major annexation scheme. Therefore, according to Chiang Kai-shek's remarks at an expanded memorial week meeting in Nanjing on the 6th, \"The Shanghai Banking Association intends to gather US$10 million from all Shanghai banks and firms to sell to the Central Bank as a way to fulfill their responsibilities.\" Chiang Kai-shek was enraged by this and, at the meeting, vehemently cursed the Shanghai banking community, saying that they \"still have the same mindset as they did twenty or thirty years ago, loving only money and not the country, knowing only selfishness and not the people's livelihood, with no change whatsoever.\" He threatened them, saying, \"Since they do not love the country (the four major families), the country will not be lenient with them either.\" Chiang Kai-shek finally set a deadline of September 8th for all major commercial banks and firms in Shanghai to automatically register and deposit all their foreign exchange with the puppet Central Bank; otherwise, they would be \"severely punished.\" At the same time, he ordered the puppet Vice Minister of Finance, Xu Baiyuan, and Yu Hongjun to go to Shanghai on the 7th to force the commercial banks and firms to hand over their foreign exchange. This foreign exchange asset is rumored to \"total US$400 million\" (Reuters, Shanghai, 7th). Under Chiang Kai-shek's hooligan-like threats and the application of violence, although Shanghai commercial banks and firms prepared to hand over a portion of their foreign exchange, many firms adopted a passive resistance approach and \"sold all or most of their assets, remitting them to Guangzhou, and then converting them into Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou to escape to Hong Kong\" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th).\n\nAnother method used by the Kuomintang reactionary government to annex commercial banks and firms was the so-called \"Measures for Adjusting the Capital of Commercial Banks\" passed by the puppet Executive Yuan on the 4th. These \"Measures\" stipulated that commercial banks and firms in the Kuomintang-controlled areas must re-adjust their capital. For example, the minimum capital for joint-stock banks in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou was set at 500,000 puppet gold yuan notes, and the minimum capital for money shops of the same nature was 250,000 puppet gold yuan notes. Those that did not meet this minimum were not allowed to operate. If firms wished to continue operating, in addition to converting their original capital into puppet gold yuan notes, at most 50% of the shortfall could be covered by revaluing the original assets, while at least 50% of the capital must be subscribed in cash by the original shareholders in proportion within two months. This cash must be deposited with the puppet Central Bank within three months of completing the capital increase, and its use would require the approval of the competent authority of the puppet Ministry of Finance. This means that each commercial bank and firm must contribute at least 50% of its newly increased capital in cash to the puppet Central Bank, allowing this treasury of the four major families to \"increase capital.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Under the large-scale robbery and plunder by the four major families, a large amount of capital from the Kuomintang-controlled areas has fled to Hong Kong. According to Reuters, Shanghai, 8th, citing reports from Ta Kung Pao, Xinwen Bao, and Shen Bao, \"Guangzhou has become an open channel for the flow of funds from Shanghai to Hong Kong.\" A Hong Kong report from Xinwen Bao stated that since the promulgation of the \"Economic Control\" regulations, the funds flowing into Hong Kong from Shanghai \"have been so large that they cannot be estimated.\" Due to the large influx of foreign currency and gold, the Hong Kong market has been in severe turmoil in the past few days. A Guangzhou correspondent for the same paper reported that in the six days from September 2nd to 7th, \"approximately 1.6 million gold yuan flowed into Guangzhou from Shanghai.\" According to Ta Kung Pao's statistics, 644,701 puppet gold yuan were remitted to Guangzhou from Shanghai and other places on September 4th alone, and 672,169 yuan on September 6th. These funds flowing into Guangzhou were then converted into Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou and escaped to Hong Kong. According to a TASS report from Shanghai on the 7th, citing Ta Kung Pao, the Kuomintang reactionary government was \"seriously shocked\" by the large amount of capital fleeing from Shanghai to South China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋贼公开抢劫商业行庄　商民识破阴谋大量资金逃往香港\n\n1948-09-16\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋贼公开抢劫商业行庄\n  　商民识破阴谋大量资金逃往香港\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】据各方消息：国民党反动政府，近日正加紧吞并其统治区各地尤其是上海的四大家族以外的一切商业行庄。夺取行庄手中所存有的外币金银。在八月十九日蒋贼公布的“金银外币处理办法”中，即规定除伪中央银行及其委托的银行之外，其他银行、钱庄一律不准收兑、持有或保管黄金、白银、银币及外币，必须分别向伪中央银行折换及储存。商业行庄知道这是一个大吞并的阴谋。所以，据蒋介石于六日在南京扩大纪念周会上说：“上海银行公会理事会，拟集合上海所有各行庄凑集美金一千万元卖给中央银行，便算塞责了事。”蒋贼为此恼羞成怒，乃在该会上破口大骂上海银行界，说他们“仍如过去二三十年前不爱国家只爱金钱，只知自私不知民生的脑筋，毫无改变”；并恫吓他们说：“彼等既不爱国家（四大家族），而国家对他们自亦无所姑息”。蒋贼最后限定上海各大商业行庄必须于九月八日以前，将所有外汇自动向伪中央银行登记存放，否则便“予以严厉制裁”。同时又命伪财次徐柏园及俞鸿钧等于七日去沪，强迫各商业行庄交出外汇。这笔外汇资产，据传“总数共达四亿美元”（路透社上海七日电）。上海各商业行庄在蒋贼流氓式的恫吓及暴力相加的威胁之下，虽然准备交出一部分外汇，但不少行庄则采取消极抵抗的办法，而“将其全部或大部分资产变卖，汇至广州，再由广州套汇港币，逃往香港”（中央社南京七日电）。\n    国民党反动政府吞并商业行庄的另一办法，是伪行政院于四日通过的所谓“商业银行调整资本办法”。这一“办法”规定国民党统治区各地的商业行庄必须重行调整资本，例如上海、天津、广州三市股份有限公司性质的银行资本最低额，规定为五十万伪金元券，同一性质的钱庄资本最低额为二十五万伪金元券，凡不足此最低额者，即不准营业。如需继续营业的行庄，除以原有资本折算伪金元券外，不足之数中至多只能有百分之五十由原有资产重新估价抵补，而至少有百分之五十的资本必须于两个月内由原股东按比例认缴现金。这笔现金并须于完成增资后三个月内，储存于伪中央银行，如有用途应经伪财政部主管机关之核准，才能动用。这就是说，每一商业行庄至少必须拿出其新增资本百分五十的现金，奉献给伪中央银行，让这个四大家族的金库去“增资”。\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】在四大家族进行大规模抢劫掳掠之下，国民党统治区的大量资金已逃往香港。据路透社上海八日电引大公报、新闻报、申报的消息称：“广州已成为上海资金向香港流转的敞开孔道”。新闻报香港消息称：自“经济管制”条例颁布以来，从上海流入香港的资金，“已庞大得无法估计”。由于大宗外币黄金的流入，过去数日内香港市场已剧烈混乱。该报广州通讯报导，自九月二日至七日的六天之内，“约有一百六十万金元自上海流入广州”。另据大公报统计：九月四日一天之内上海等地汇入广州的伪金元为六十四万四千七百零一元；六日一天之内为六十七万二千一百六十九元。这些流入广州的资金，便在广州套汇港币，逃往香港。据塔斯社上海七日电引大公报消息称：国民党反动政府已为大量资金自上海逃至华南一事所“严重震惊”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Northeast Telegram\n\n\tBird's-Eye View of Major Cities in the Northeast Liberated Area\n    Within the interconnected Northeast Liberated Area, a dense network of railways and highways links 230 cities and towns of all sizes. Over the past three years, these cities have gradually embarked on a path of sound development under the vigorous protection and active restoration efforts of the democratic government. Especially in the past six months, due to the thorough implementation of the policy of developing production, prospering the economy, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, a new and thriving atmosphere has emerged.\n    Harbin, with a population of over 800,000, is the capital of the Northeast Liberated Area and its political, economic, and cultural center. Five railways radiate in all directions, connecting major cities and towns in eastern, western, southern, and northern Manchuria. Trucks on the highways and ships on the Songhua River travel back and forth incessantly, making industry and commerce extremely prosperous. According to statistics at the end of June, there were 26,320 industrial and commercial establishments in the city, an increase of three and a half times compared to February of last year, and unemployment has gradually disappeared. The municipal construction, such as the supply of tap water, electricity, fuel, and grain, has been sufficient and abundant due to the vigorous management of the democratic government. There has been great development in culture and education in the past three years. The city now has more than ten colleges and universities, including the Northeast Academy of Sciences, the Industrial University, and the Railway College, as well as six middle schools and one normal school, and nearly two hundred primary schools. The publishing industry includes more than 20 public and private newspapers and periodicals, such as the Northeast Daily, the Harbin Daily, the Northeast Pictorial, and Knowledge Magazine. Among them, the Northeast Daily sells more than 70,000 copies daily, covering all parts of the Northeast Liberated Area. There are more than 33,000 foreign residents from more than 20 countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, Korea, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, and Romania, who operate more than 700 industrial and commercial enterprises. They are protected by the democratic government and receive equal treatment in all material supplies under the principle of complying with the laws and regulations of the democratic government.\n    Traveling northwest from Harbin by train along the Changchun Railway for eight hours will take you to Qiqihar. The city is one of the oldest cities in Northeast China and is now the economic center of Heilongjiang and Nenjiang provinces. Goods from the Nenjiang River basin and the Mongolian grasslands northwest of Qiqihar are gathered and distributed here. Business is booming in the city, with the South Gate being the most prosperous. Mongolians, Manchus, Han Chinese, and Hui people trade here, mainly in grain, timber, furs, mountain products, and industrial products, and new industries are also increasing daily. According to statistics in early August, there were 4,021 industrial and commercial establishments in the city. The city has railways south to Liaoyuan and Siping, northwest to Manzhouli, northeast to Bei'an and Nenjiang, and southeast to Harbin, all of which are unobstructed.\n    Mudanjiang City, 270 kilometers southeast of Harbin, is a newly emerging city in Northeast China. Fifteen years ago, the city was just a small station on the Changchun Railway. Because of the abundance of timber and various industrial raw materials in the surrounding area, it became an important town after the construction of the railway connecting Tumen in the south and Jiamusi in the north. According to statistics in May of this year, there are more than 5,000 industrial and commercial establishments in the city, more than half of which are modern industries. Their products sell well in northern and southern Manchuria. The total number of workers in the city is more than 100,000.\n    Jiamusi, the capital of Hejiang Province, located on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Songhua River, is also one of the emerging large cities in Northeast China. Two railways extend in semicircles towards Harbin, taking 18 hours to reach the whole journey. The Songhua River has frequent shipping, making the city the most prosperous water and land port in the lower reaches of the Songhua River. Industry and commerce are developing rapidly. There are nearly 3,000 industrial and commercial households in the city, including 803 new industrial establishments from January to April of this year. Helibei County, north of the city, is rich in coal, which is of good quality and high output. In addition to supplying the entire province, it also supplies a large amount to Harbin and its surrounding areas.\n    Jilin City is located on the right bank of the Songhua River and is the fourth largest city in Northeast China. The scenery in the suburbs is beautiful and is known as the \"First Scenery Under Heaven.\" It has a population of about 260,000. In 1943, the Japanese invaders completed the famous Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant here, which supplied electricity to Jingbo Lake, Fuxin, Xi'an, Fushun, Anshan, and other places, with a power generation capacity of 280,000 kilowatts, making Jilin a heavy industrial city. This March, within 20 days after the city was liberated, trains to Harbin were running smoothly. Tap water, electricity, post and telecommunications were also quickly restored. Except for industries that are detrimental to the people's livelihood, such as luxury goods and superstitious items, the rest of the industry has been fully restored. Among the industries, papermaking, cement, flax, synthetic petroleum, and shipbuilding are well-known. The market is much more prosperous than during the Kuomintang rule. The city now has Northeast University, Industrial College, Midwifery School, and four middle schools, with more than a thousand students each. There are more than 20,000 primary school students.\n    East of Jilin, Yanji City on the north bank of the Tumen River has railways north to Mudanjiang and west to Jilin, and can be transferred to Harbin from Lafa. It is one of the oldest cities in Northeast China. Before Jilin was recovered, it was the seat of the Jilin Provincial Government. Due to the enemy and puppet regimes' various monopolistic rule before August 15th, there were only about 500 industrial and commercial establishments in the city. In the three years since liberation, with the support of the democratic government, factories and shops have been increasing daily. There are now 2,500 formal industrial and commercial establishments. Yanji's school education is particularly developed, with 19 public and private middle schools, and the number of middle school students accounts for 21 per thousand of the total population of the county. Fifty percent of the students are poor children who could not attend school in the past.\n    Sipingjie, southwest of Jilin, is the transportation center of Manchuria and one of the emerging cities. It is a strategic point in military terms, and in economic terms, it is also an industrial town due to the abundant coal reserves in the nearby Xi'an area. The original railway runs north to Changchun, south to Shenyang, east to Xi'an, and west to Liaoyuan, turning north to Qiqihar, or turning to Rehe from Liaoyuan. The urban area has a considerable scale of modern industrial base, but it was reduced to a dead city during the occupation of Chiang's troops. After our army recovered it, the railways east to Xi'an and to the rear of Liaoyuan were opened long ago. The number of industrial and commercial establishments that have been restored and newly opened has reached more than 1,600, including machinery, leather, papermaking, cloth and groceries. Post, telephone, and tap water were restored within a few days after the liberation, and the restoration of electricity made the dead city, which had been dark for more than a year, see the light again.\n    Traveling southeast by train from Sipingjie will take you to Tonghua, Ji'an, and other places. From Ji'an, you can reach Andong City on the banks of the Yalu River in two days by car. The city is one of the economic centers of southern Manchuria and the seat of the Andong Provincial Government. The southern section of the Anfeng Railway has long been opened to traffic, and in addition to the highways northeast to Tonghua and Ji'an, there are also highways west to Wafangdian and Haicheng on the southern section of the Changchun Railway. Since the city was re-liberated last year, especially after the southern Manchurian liberated area has been gradually expanded and the transportation with northern Manchuria has been restored and smooth, it has gradually recovered and has some development. According to recent statistics, there are 1,849 industrial establishments and 3,200 stores. The city's textile, papermaking, shipbuilding, and other industries are very large in scale and occupy an important position in Northeast China's industry.\n    Wafangdian, the political and economic center of the southern Liaoning area west of Andong and south of Shenyang, is densely populated, and its textile industry is the most developed. Because of its coastal location, the fishing and salt industries are very developed, and the fruit-growing area is also vast.\n    In addition, there are Anshan and Yingkou, newly recovered cities in the southern Liaoning area. Anshan is located 120 miles south of Shenyang and is the location of one of the largest steel mills in the Far East, known as the \"Steel Capital,\" \"Iron Capital,\" and \"Treasure of Manchurian Industry.\" The iron reserves are 600 million tons. Yingkou is located at the mouth of the Liao River and is an important trading port in southern Manchuria, mainly producing fish and salt. Due to the long-term rule and destruction of the Kuomintang bandit troops in the above two cities, the people's lives are extremely difficult, and the recovery of industry and commerce is also more difficult. At present, the democratic government is continuing to vigorously support industry and commerce and help the people solve production difficulties.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北解放区主要城市鸟瞰\n\n1948-09-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北解放区主要城市鸟瞰\n    在联成一片的东北解放区内，密如蛛网的铁路与公路联结着二百卅个大中小城市。三年来，这些城市在民主政府大力保护和积极恢复下，已逐渐走上了健全发展的道路，特别是在过去半年中，由于贯彻执行发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的方针，更呈现了蒸蒸日上的新气象。\n    拥有八十多万人口的哈尔滨，是东北解放区的首府，政治、经济、文化的中心。五条铁路向四周辐射，畅通东西南北满各大城镇，公路线上的汽车大车和松花江上的航轮往来不绝，工商业极为繁盛。据六月底统计，该市工商业共达两万六千三百二十家，较去年二月增加三倍半，失业现象已逐渐敛迹。市政建设如自来水、电力、燃料及粮食的供应上，由于民主政府的大力经营，目前已足够而有余裕。文化教育方面三年来更有极大之发展。市内现有东北科学院、工业大学、铁路学院等专科以上学校十余所，中学六所及师范学校一所，与小学近两百所。出版业有东北日报、哈尔滨日报、东北画报，知识杂志等二十余家公私营报刊。其中东北日报每日畅销七万余份，遍及东北解放区各地。市内外侨有苏、美、英、法、朝鲜、捷、匈、意、罗等二十余国侨民三万三千余人，经营工商业之外侨共七百余家。他们在遵守民主政府法令的原则下经营各种工商业，同样得到了民主政府的保护和一切物资供应上的平等待遇。\n    从哈尔滨沿中长铁路搭火车向西北行八小时可抵齐齐哈尔。该市为东北古老城市之一，现在是黑龙江、嫩江两省经济中心。嫩江流城及齐市西北蒙古草原之商货，均以此为集散地。市内生意兴隆，以南门最盛，蒙满汉回均贸易于此，以粮食、木材、皮毛山货及工业产品为大宗，新兴工业也日有增加。据八月初统计：全市工商业共为四○二一家。该市有铁路南到辽源、四平，西北到满洲里，东北到北安、嫩江，东南到哈尔滨，各线均畅通无阻。\n    哈市东南二百七十公里之牡丹江市，为东北一新兴城市。该市十五年前还是中长路上一小站，因附近盛产木材及各种工业原料，自修筑南通图们北到佳木斯的铁路后，乃成要镇。据本年五月份统计：全市工商业已超过五千家，半数以上为现代化的工业，产品畅销南北满各地。统计全市工人达十万以上。\n    位于松花江下游南岸的合江省省会佳木斯，也是东北新兴大城市之一。有两条铁路各以半圆形伸向哈尔滨，全程十八小时可到。松花江航轮来往频繁，故该市已成为松花江下游最繁盛的水陆码头。工商业日渐发达。现全市有工商业近三千户，其中本年一月至四月新闻的工业即达八○三家。市北鹤立县盛产煤炭，煤质好，产量大，除供应全省外，并大量供应哈市及其附近地区。\n    吉林城濒松花江右岸，为东北第四大城。四郊景色美丽，有“天下第一江山”之称。人口约二十六万。一九四三年日寇在此完成著名的小丰满水力发电厂，曾供给镜泊湖、阜新、西安、抚顺、鞍山等地电力，发电量达二十八万基罗瓦特，使吉林一跃而为重工业城市。今年三月该市重获解放后二十天中，与哈尔滨之火车即告畅通。自来水、电力、邮电等亦迅速恢复。工商业除不利国民生计的奢侈品迷信品等行业外，其余已完全复业。工业中以造纸、洋灰、亚麻、人造石油与修船等为著。市面较国民党统治时期已大见繁荣。市内现有东北大学、工业专门学校、助产学校及中学四所，学生皆在千人以上。小学学生达两万余人。\n    吉林以东，图们江北岸之延吉市，有铁路北通牡丹江，西通吉林，并可由拉法转哈尔滨，是东北古老城市之一，在吉林未收复前曾为吉林省政府所在地。市内工商业因“八一五”前遭敌伪各种垄断统治，仅剩五百家左右，解放后三年来，在民主政府扶植下，工厂商店日有增加，现正式工商业已达二千五百家。延吉学校教育特别发达，有公私立中学十九所，中学生数目占全县人口总数千分之二十一。学生中有百分之五十为过去根本不能入学之贫苦子弟。\n    吉林西南之四平街，为满洲交通中心亦是新兴城市之一。在军事上为一战略要点，在经济上以其附近西安诸地煤藏极丰，故亦为一工业重镇。原有铁路北通长春，南到沈阳，东至西安，西到辽源北转齐齐哈尔，或从辽源转向热河境内。市区有相当规模的现代工业基础，但在蒋军侵占期间曾沦为一座死城。我军收复后，东到西安和通往辽源后方的铁路早已畅通。工商业恢复和新开的已达一千六百余家，其中有机械、皮革、造纸、布匹杂货等业。邮政、电话、自来水，在解放后几天内即告恢复，而电力的恢复更使黑暗了一年多的死城重见光明。\n    从四平街乘火车东南行，可达通化、辑安等地，从辑安乘汽车两天可达鸭绿江滨之安东市，该市为南满经济中心之一，亦为安东省府所在地。现安奉铁路南段早已通车，公路除东北到通化、辑安外，向西并至中长路南段的瓦房店、海城两地。市内工商业自去年重获解放，特别是南满解放区日渐扩大，与北满交通恢复畅通后，乃逐渐恢复并有若干发展。据最近统计：有工业一八四九家，商店三二○○家。该市纺织、造纸、造船等工业规模甚大，在东北工业中占重要地位。\n    安东以西沈阳以南的辽南地区政治经济中心为瓦房店，该地人口稠密，以纺织业最为发达。因地势滨海，故渔业、盐业，均甚发达，水果种植地区亦广。\n    此外辽南地区尚有鞍山、营口等新收复城市。鞍山位沈阳南一百二十里，为远东最大炼钢厂之一的所在地，有“钢都”、“铁都”及“满洲工业之宝”之称。铁的蕴藏量达六万万吨。营口位于辽河入海处，为南满一重要贸易港口，以出产渔盐为大宗。以上两城由于国民党匪军长期的统治和破坏，人民生活极为困苦，工商各业之恢复也较艰难。目前民主政府正继续大力扶植工商业，帮助人民解决生产困难。　　　　　\n　　【新华社东北电】"

    "content": "Military Families Encourage Sons to Perform Meritorious Service\n  　Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict Troops Further Consolidated\n    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] The Fourth Military Subdistrict troops, in conjunction with local governments and the masses, have been using military families' encouragement of their relatives to reassure them in killing the enemy, which has played a significant role in consolidating and educating the troops. Because the government and the masses have taken good care of military families, and coupled with continuous explanations of the nationwide victory situation, the military families' awareness has been raised. When they visit their relatives in the troops, they directly carry out consolidation work with the soldiers. Dong Chunming, a soldier in the Fifth Company of a certain unit, was always thinking about his wife and not focusing on his work. After his wife found out, she went to see him and encouraged him, saying, \"I am an activist at home, serving as the chairman of the village women's rescue association, and I have also performed meritorious service. You must work hard and perform great meritorious service in the army, so that our family will be glorious!\" These words touched Chunming's heart and greatly boosted his enthusiasm for killing the enemy. Jiao Boying's soldier, Jiang Wansheng's old mother, educated her son, saying, \"You joined the Liberation Army of your own accord, so you must work hard. The family is much better off than before!

During the military families' persuasion campaign, the Fifth Company of a certain unit specially convened a meeting of military family members who came to visit their relatives, warmly received them, and Zhang Baohai's mother said, \"We must make them feel at ease!\" After the discussion, the idea of dragging the troops back was overcome in some military families, which played a role in consolidating the troops.

After discovering insect eggs and armyworms in Yangcun Village and other villages in the seventh district, the County Party Committee immediately notified all districts to conduct thorough inspections and promptly mobilized the masses to eliminate them. Within six or seven days, armyworms were found throughout the county (leaving only three or four villages unaffected). In Jintai Village in the fifth district, 500 mu of the 560 mu of millet was consumed. 122 villages suffered heavy damage, accounting for over a quarter of the county's villages. According to incomplete statistics, in 338 villages, 318,100 mu of millet were consumed, and over 50,000 mu had their leaves half-eaten. In this serious situation, the County Party Committee immediately instructed all districts to cease all other work and concentrate all efforts on leading the masses to thoroughly eliminate the armyworms. It was also decided to establish county, district, and village-level pest control headquarters or committees to actively lead the masses in pest extermination. Initially, the masses had many ideological concerns. Some believed that \"you can't catch them all, and they will ruin the crops anyway.\" Others said, \"This is fate, the more you catch, the more there are.\" To break through the masses' thinking, the County Party Committee put forward the slogan \"Catch one less, get one less. Fight the armyworms for our rice bowls!\" and educated the masses on the concept of the collective, explaining that \"the armyworms are alive, they will eat yours after they finish theirs.\" For the masses whose millet had been eaten by armyworms, slogans such as \"If you can't save the millet, save the corn!\" were put forward to deeply educate the masses and increase their confidence in exterminating the pests. They also organized activists in each village to take the lead and organize the broad masses to actively catch and kill the pests. As of the 24th of last month, all armyworms in the county had been completely eradicated.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 县委领导抓的紧　冀县虫害迅速扑灭\n\n1948-09-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　县委领导抓的紧\n  　冀县虫害迅速扑灭\n    【冀南电】冀县的虫害，因县委迅速领导四百余村群众进行了十多天捕杀，现已全部彻底扑灭。该县开始在七区杨村等村发现虫卵和黏虫后，县委即急告各区认真检查，并立即发动群众扑灭。六七天内黏虫在全县普遍发现（只剩三、四个村没有）。五区吉金台村五百六十亩谷，吃光五百亩。受重灾村一百二十二个，占全县村庄四分之一强。据不完全统计：三百三十八个村中，吃光谷子三十一万八千一百亩，吃半叶的五万多亩。在此严重情况下，该县县委立即指示各区停止一切工作，集中全力领导群众彻底消灭黏虫。并决定建立县、区、村捕虫指挥部或捕虫委员会，积极领导群众捕打。开始时，群众都有不少思想顾虑，有的认为“捉不完就把庄稼糟踏光了”。有的说：“这是天意，越捉越多”。为了打通群众思想，县委提出“打一个少一个，向黏虫争夺饭碗子”的口号，并向群众进行整体观念的教育，说明“黏虫是活的，吃完他的吃你的。”对被黏虫吃光谷子的群众提出：“保不住谷子保棒子”等口号，深入教育群众，提高了群众灭虫信心。又组织各村积极分子带头，组织广大群众，积极捕打。截至上月二十四日，已将全县黏虫全部扑灭。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-17",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Jizhong Telegram] Gao Guandou, a labor hero and Communist Party member from Dahu Village in Shen County, is enthusiastically leading the village's farmers in production, restoring and developing cooperative mutual aid. During the land reform and party rectification in the village this year, his class status was incorrectly elevated due to unclear standards, and he was removed from his position, his Party membership was suspended, his door was sealed, and he was detained for ten days. Later, the masses in the village realized the mistake and quickly unsealed his door, released him, and the branch restored his Party membership. After Gao Guandou came out, he was not pessimistic, disappointed, or prone to complaining. Instead, he was determined to lead the village's production well. (This spirit of being clear-headed, strong, actively working for the Party and the people is worth learning from by other comrades – Editor). Because during the Party rectification, some people said that his organization of mutual aid was \"not seeking interest or getting up early,\" \"only trying to please superiors, and simply engaging in paternalistic control.\" Gao Guandou humbly examined himself, constantly thinking: this year's organization of production must not be paternalistic, but must still be vibrant. Later, he came up with a new method. Gao Guandou, Zhang Maorong, Ma Wenshang and others, on the basis of the existing agricultural mutual aid group, borrowed 30,000 yuan, each contributing two bags of wheat to turn into funds, and organized a \"Promotion Group\" (also known as the Agricultural Implement Cooperative) to promote other groups and cooperatives.\n\nThe Promotion Group was responsible for Gao Guandou's management of buying and selling, combined with Zhang Maowei Luo's sideline handicrafts, and sales were made outside the village. After its establishment, the group developed its business according to the season and the needs of the farmers. For example, the masses had already hung up their hoes and were preparing for the autumn harvest, and they needed some agricultural tools, especially some newly emancipated farmers who were very short of tools. Gao Guandou and the others bought a batch of winnowing fans, sieves, fork handles, brooms, etc. Gao Guandou also had some family skills and repaired furniture very sturdily, which the masses were very willing to buy. When it was time to plant vegetables, they saw that the masses lacked vegetable seeds, so they bought a batch. They also saw that the masses had dug many new pigsties and planned to make fertilizer, so they bought a batch of pigs and sold them to the masses at low prices. Gao Guandou saw that many women on the street were idle, so he borrowed a portion of cotton from the county promotion agency and lent it to the women and weaving groups. It was stipulated that the first loan would be used as capital, and the spun thread would be exchanged for cotton later, so that there would be more and more. This brought up more than sixty women to spin thread. Gao Guandou often taught them how to spin fine thread and weave good cloth, and the spun thread and woven cloth would be sold to the Promotion Group. From March to now, in six months, twenty-seven bolts of cloth have been woven, and after seven bolts were woven for relatives for free, the remaining cloth was sold for 370 jin of rice. They said: \"If it weren't for Gao Guandou's constant guidance, we wouldn't even know where to start, and we wouldn't be able to do it for so long. That day when the thread broke, he would help us with cotton, and solve any difficulties at any time.\" Under the influence of the village, nearby Nanwang Village, Yanggong Bridge Village, etc., also went to Gao Guandou's promotion team to exchange cotton for spinning thread.\n\nGao Guandou's promotion team also paid attention to supporting the recovery of the cooperatives that had collapsed. For example, the sesame oil cooperative organized by Gao Xingzhou and others, because the division of labor and work measurement were unclear, and they did not achieve equal value for both parties, some only cared about doing their own work and eating the oil mill's food. Some worked very hard but received the same dividends as others, resulting in everyone becoming negative. Gao Guandou introduced the experience of the promotion team to them. Later, the society cleared up the old accounts and specifically divided the work, and determined the dividend method according to the size of the labor force. In this way, everyone worked very enthusiastically. The society also plans to expand its capital recently. In addition, the village's weaving cooperative also almost collapsed, but it was not collapsed after Gao Guandou's assistance. All five cooperatives in the village are very active in business under Gao Guandou's leadership.\n\nIn addition, Gao Guandou also led farmers to transform alkaline land. He saw that the alkaline land of Li Daqi, Sun Hailin and others did not grow crops for many years, so he often went to their homes to mobilize them and inspire their interest in transforming alkaline land. He also mobilized alkaline land households to pull soil to their own land to seep down the alkalinity, and cultivate it once after a rain. Now, the crops growing in the old alkaline land of Sun Hailin and others are very strong. In this way, it also inspired other households to transform alkaline land.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 大护庄共产党员高贯斗　任劳任怨领导生产\n\n1948-09-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　大护庄共产党员高贯斗\n  　任劳任怨领导生产\n    【冀中电】深县大护庄劳动英雄高贯斗，热心领导本村农民生产，恢复与发展合作互助。今年该村土改整党时，因为订成份的标准不明确，提高了他的成份，并被撤了职，停止了党籍，门也封了，还被扣了十天。后来该村群众知道作错了，很快的给他启了封，把他放出来，支部又恢复了他的党籍。高贯斗出来后，并没悲观失望乱发牢骚，而且他决心把本村生产领导好。（这种清醒坚强为党、为人民积极工作的精神值得其他同志学习——编者）因整党时有人说他组织互助是“不图利息不打早起”、“光为往上级讨好，净包办代替”。高贯斗便虚心的检讨了自己，不断的想：今年组织生产既不包办代替，又要搞的红火。后来，便想了一个新办法，由高贯斗、张茂荣、马文尚等几家，在前有的农业互助组的基础上，又贷了三万元的款，每家拿出两口袋麦子变成款，组织了个“推进组”（又名农具合作社），以推动别的组和合作社。\n    推进社由高贯斗负责张罗买卖，结合着张马尾罗的副业手工，外出销售。成立后，便根据季节和农民需要开展业务，如群众已挂了锄都准备秋收，需要一些农具，尤其是一些新翻身的农民农具很缺。高贯斗他们便买了一批簸箩、筛子、杈把、扫帚等。高贯斗又会些家传手艺，把家具收拾的很结实，群众都很愿买。种菜时他们见到群众缺菜种，便买了一批。他们又见到群众挖了好些新猪圈打算造肥，便买来一批猪贱价出卖给群众。高贯斗见到街上好些老婆闲着没事，便到本县推进社贷来一部分棉花，借给老婆们和纺织组；并规定头一次借的作本，以后纺了线再换棉花，这样越来越多。带起了六十多个老婆纺线。高贯斗经常去教给她们怎么纺细线、织好布，纺了线、织了布到推进组去卖。从三月到现在，六个月已织了廿七匹布，除七匹是给亲戚家白织的外，其余卖了三百七十斤米。她们说：“要不是高贯斗不断的指挥，俺也摸不着门，也做不了这么长工夫。那天纺线断了棉花，他就接济一下，有点难事随时给解决。”在该村影响下，附近南王庄、杨贡桥等村，也到高贯斗的推进组里换棉纺线。\n    高贯斗的推进组，并注意扶植垮了台的合作社复业。如高兴周等组织的香油合作社，因为分工、计工不清，没有作到等价两利，有的只顾做自己活，吃油房的饭。有的卖很大力气也和别人一样分红，结果都消极起来。高贯斗便把推进组的经验介绍给他们。后来该社清理了一下旧帐，又具体分了工，并根据劳动力的大小确定了分红办法。这样谁也干的很上劲。该社并计划最近扩大资金。此外，该村织布合作社也几乎垮台，后经高贯斗帮助，才没垮台。全村五个合作社，在高贯斗领导下，业务都很活跃。\n    此外，高贯斗还领导农民改造碱地。他见到李大起、孙海林等家的碱地成年不长庄稼，便经常到他们几家动员，启发他们改造碱地的兴趣。并动员碱地户到自己地里拉土，把碱性渗下去，下一场雨耕一次。现在孙海林等几家的十几亩老碱地长的庄稼很强。这样，也启发了别的户改造碱地。"

    "content": "Due to the Kuomintang army's stubborn resistance and frantic plunder, prices in the few isolated strongholds of Changchun and Shenyang have skyrocketed, causing immense suffering for the people, who are rising up in resistance.\n    In Changchun, the price of sorghum per pound was 3.8 million yuan (puppet Northeast circulating currency, same below) on August 2nd, and had soared to 29.5 million yuan by August 18th. In those sixteen days, the price of one pound of sorghum increased by an average of 1,100 yuan per minute. At the same time, even tree bark was selling for 600,000 yuan per pound. In market transactions, currency notes with denominations below 5,000 yuan were weighed by the pound. One pound of 1,000-yuan notes was worth 250,000 yuan; it took 118 pounds of 1,000-yuan notes to buy one pound of sorghum. Another reason for the soaring grain prices in the city, according to the Peiping World Daily on August 16th, was the Kuomintang bank's excessive issuance of promissory notes, reaching 500 to 600 billion yuan per day. The Kuomintang army's plunder in the city has become all-pervasive. The most common practice is to break into people's homes to rob them, even stealing steamed bean noodles and tree bark cakes that citizens haven't finished cooking. Many citizens are forced to cook at night. According to a report in the Shenyang newspaper on August 10th, grain prices in Shenyang rose sharply in half a month: sorghum from 140,000 yuan to 240,000 yuan per pound, and corn from 130,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan. The Kuomintang army's grain robbery in Shenyang is roughly the same as in Changchun, but they can also rob in the suburban areas. In one village in Tieling, the Kuomintang army even killed piglets weighing only ten pounds when they arrived. The people begged, \"The pig is too small! Please don't kill it!\" The Kuomintang army replied, \"It's still bigger than a chicken!\"\n    The populations of Changchun and Shenyang are decreasing rapidly. The Kuomintang army in Changchun is driving large numbers of citizens out of the city. Police arrest people on the streets every day, search their bodies for all their belongings, and then drive them out of the city. The Kuomintang authorities in the city also issued an order stating that only citizens with three months' worth of food reserves who register can live in the urban area; all others must be driven out. According to Zheng Zongyin, a worker representative who came to our liberated area from Changchun, when he left Changchun, the city authorities were investigating wealthy peasants and landlords who had fled into the city last year, preparing to plunder their grain and then drive them out. According to statistics released by the puppet municipal government of Shenyang, the population in July had fallen to 992,000, more than half the population at the time of the Japanese surrender. More than half of the citizens remaining in Shenyang are unemployed and starving. According to the Kuomintang city authorities, more than 620,000 of these nearly one million people are destitute, unemployed workers, and refugees.\n    Under the brutal oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang army, the people's resistance is growing daily. All railway employees from Shenyang to Benxi (including the Benxi Coal Mine, totaling over 30,000 people) went on strike on July 27th. Trains on all lines were suspended, and work in engineering, machinery, and telecommunications was completely halted. They put forward five demands, including increased wages, distribution of grain, and timely payment of salaries. By early August, the Kuomintang authorities, under the workers' powerful pressure, were forced to concede, and the struggle came to an end. Workers in various departments of the Benxi Coal and Iron Company (including electrical, foundry, special steel, electric light factory, and large factories) began a strike on August 7th. Over 400 workers, armed with wooden sticks and iron picks, surrounded the company manager's office building, demanding food. They persisted until the next day, when the company agreed to the workers' wage increase demands, and the strike ended victoriously. All primary school teachers in Changchun went on strike for a month, finally forcing the municipal government to grant primary school teachers the same grain rations as municipal government employees. The poor are constantly staging grain riots. On the night of July 27th, seventy or eighty people broke through the enemy's \"suppression team\" guard and opened the warehouse in the backyard of the puppet Kantei Hall to carry away grain. On another occasion, when enemy grain trucks passed by, starving people swarmed forward and robbed all the grain. Recently, when enemy grain trucks drive through the area, hundreds of people often lie down on the road, preventing the trucks from passing and demanding the return of the grain stolen from the people. Although the Kuomintang authorities are doing their utmost to suppress these actions, mass riots continue to erupt.\n    Workers, students, and the poor, unable to bear the Kuomintang's persecution and exploitation, are fleeing to the liberated areas in droves. Electric power workers Cui Fengyi, Wang Maocai, and over 180 members of their families recently escaped from the Kuomintang-controlled area. As soon as they arrived in the liberated area, they said, \"This time, we've finally returned home!\"\n\n　　　　　　　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Dispatch\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孤岛长沈\n\n1948-09-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孤岛长沈\n    由于国民党军的盘踞顽抗以及疯狂的掠夺，长春、沈阳等少数孤立据点物价狂涨，生活痛苦万分，人民纷纷起而反抗。\n    长春市八月二日高粱米每斤为三百八十万元（伪东北流通券，下同）八月十八日已涨至二千九百五十万元。一斤高粱米在这十六天中平均每分钟涨价一千一百元。同时连树皮都卖到每斤六十万元。市面交易时，票面额在五千以下的流通券都是过秤以斤计算的。一千元的流通券每斤值二十五万，要一百一十八斤一千元的流通券才能买到一斤高粱米。该市粮价狂涨另一原因据八月十六日北平世界日报透露，系由于国民党银行滥发本票，每日达五、六千亿元。该市国民党军的掠夺已发展至无孔不入，最通常的是闯进民家去抢，连市民还没有蒸熟的豆面和树皮的饼子都抢走，许多市民被迫改在晚上煮饭。沈阳的粮价据八月十日该市报载：半月间高粱米从每斤十四万涨到二十四万，苞米从十三万涨到二十二万。该市国民党军的抢粮大致跟长春的相同，不过可以抢到城郊地区。如铁岭一个村，国民党军来时连十斤重的小猪都杀了，老百姓哀求说：“猪太小哩！不要杀吧！”国民党军回答：“总比鸡大吧！”\n    长、沈两地人口均在急剧减少。长春市国民党军正把大量市民驱出市外。警察每天在街上抓人，搜尽身上财物后便逐到城外。该市国民党当局并曾下令宣布：除有三个月存粮的市民经登记可住在市区外，其余一律赶出市区。据自长市来我解放区之工人代表郑宗印谈，他离长时该市当局正调查去年逃进城去的富农地主，准备在搜刮他们的粮食后赶出城外。沈阳市据伪市府发表统计，七月份人口已降为九十九万二千余人，较日寇投降时减少一半以上。而所有这些留沈的市民半数以上都在失业和饥饿中。据国民党市当局供认，这近百万人中有六十二万多人是赤贫、失业工人和难民。\n    在国民党军残暴压榨下，人民的反抗日益增长。沈阳至本溪的全体铁路员工（包括本溪煤矿共三万余人），于七月廿七日起怠工，各线车辆停驶，工务、机务、电务亦全部停顿。他们提出增资、发粮食及准时发薪等五项要求，至八月初国民党当局在工人强大威力下被迫让步，斗争始告一段落。本溪煤铁公司各部工人（包活电气、翻砂、特殊钢，电灯厂、大工厂等）于八月七日开始罢工，工人四百余手持木棍、铁镐等包围该公司经理办公的大楼，要求给饭吃，坚持到次日，公司答应工人增资要求，罢工乃胜利结束。长春市全体小学教员曾罢教达一个月，终于迫使市府答应小学教员与市府职员发给同等粮食的要求。贫民不断发生抢粮骚动。七月二十七日夜间，有七、八十人冲破敌“清剿队”警戒，打开伪康德会馆后院的仓库搬运粮食；另一次当敌军粮车经过马路时，饥民即一拥而上将粮抢光。近来该地敌军运粮汽车行驶时，常有数百群众横卧路上，阻止汽车通过，要求退回自老百姓手中抢来的粮食。国民党当局对此虽竭力镇压，但群众性的骚动，仍此伏彼起。\n    工人、学生及贫民等不堪国民党迫害榨取纷纷逃来解放区。电力工人崔凤仪、王茂材等及其家属一百八十余名日前逃出国民党统治区，他们一到解放区就说：“这回才算回到了自己家里！”　　　　　　　　【新华社东北电】"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th. The Liaodong Financial and Economic Office convened a conference of factory directors from the Andong region in mid-July to summarize the production work of various factories in the first half of the year. It was decided that the central task for the second half of the year would be to expand production and begin restoring heavy industry. The conference also put forward specific requirements for the production volume of each factory. According to the conference's inspection, since Andong was liberated again in June of last year, in the past year, almost all state-owned enterprises in the Andong area, except for individual factories that were completely destroyed by the enemy and certain heavy industries, have eliminated the scars of enemy destruction. The average production capacity has recovered to 90% to 95% of the Puppet Manchukuo period. Some, such as a certain textile factory, have even exceeded the number of spindles operating during the Puppet Manchukuo period by 43%. Due to the greatly increased labor enthusiasm of the workers, the production achievements in the first half of this year have made significant progress compared with the second half of last year. For example, the total amount of yarn spun by a textile factory in the first half of the year exceeded the second half of last year by 300%. The output of artificial fur from the Andong Silk Weaving Factory exceeded 165%. The Saima Coal Mine completed 84% of its annual production target in the first half of the year. In terms of factory management, there have also been many achievements in the past six months. For example, the Andong Silk Weaving Factory established a statistical reporting system and a hierarchical reporting and inspection system, and strictly implemented receipt and expenditure procedures and warehouse management. The factory director used these systems to grasp the overall production situation of the factory. The savings of various factories in the first half of the year reached more than 1.3 billion yuan for the rubber and silk weaving factories alone. However, from the perspective of enterprise management of factories, various factories still have, to varying degrees, a certain state of indiscipline, lack of planning, and handicraft-style work practices. The conference believes that the following issues urgently need to be resolved in the future:\n\n    I. Cost Accounting\n\n    Whether cost accounting is correct or not is the main indicator of measuring whether a factory is well-run. Cost accounting includes the accurate calculation of raw materials, material costs, labor costs, property depreciation costs, and management fees. Because some factories have not accurately investigated and assessed the actual property, and have not made a property depreciation rate, and at the same time have not established or improved a regular raw material and material inventory system, the calculation of the two elements of cost calculation—raw materials and materials—and property depreciation cannot be accurate. Secondly, some consumption is not calculated or is not calculated at the actual price in the cost, such as the raw material of iron, because it does not need to be purchased, the pricing is particularly low; parts or raw materials and materials found from the waste pile are used or consumed, and they are not included in the cost; some data does not calculate the cost at the current actual price but at the original price, thus forming the illusion that the price of raw materials and data is low and the price of finished products is particularly high. Correct cost accounting must first accurately investigate the property (including raw material and material inventory and other property) and conduct an assessment to understand the total capital of the factory, and then determine the property depreciation rate. In addition, there must be accurate work-hour statistics, and then calculate the ratio and standard profit rate of the four expenses—raw materials, materials, labor, depreciation, and management—in various finished products according to a certain price, and study ways to reduce costs from the reasons for the rise or fall of the proportion of various expenses in each period.\n\n    II. Establish Statistical, Reporting, and Inspection Systems\n\n    The accuracy of cost accounting must have sound statistical, reporting (hierarchical reporting), and inspection systems. Some factory cost accountants only simply keep accounts, and do not supplement them with investigation and statistical work, so they cannot understand the problems that occur in the production process, and cannot study the reasons for high or low costs. If statistical personnel are set up in each department and even each unit, a hierarchical reporting system is implemented, and a sound daily work report and timely inspection work are carried out, responsible cadres can avoid the busyness of bureaucracy and can understand the number of absences, the amount of work-hour losses, the amount of raw materials and materials entering and leaving the warehouse, the amount of finished products put into the warehouse, the amount of waste losses, what difficulties have occurred, and how to solve them in a timely manner every day; and can timely calculate the ratio of labor costs and raw material costs and the loss rate in a finished product to ensure the accuracy of cost accounting.\n\n    III. Organization of Labor\n\n    After having correct cost accounting, one of the important issues in reducing costs is the rationalization of labor organization and use. Some factories have increased production efficiency and saved raw materials by 50% to 100% in the past year, but they still consume too much manpower. For example, indirect production personnel in the Saima Coal Mine account for half of all production personnel. The labor cost of a finished product in the silk weaving factory accounts for 55%. The rational organization and use of labor, in addition to being familiar with the efficiency of the machine and improving labor conditions, the main thing is to organize and give play to the labor enthusiasm of the workers. There are two methods for this: one is the merit campaign; the other is the establishment of a progressive wage system and an attendance system. For example, a factory in a certain textile factory stipulates certain conditions for each grade of wages, such as how many spindles to watch, the quality standard, and caring for the machine. After watching one machine is reduced from two people to one person, the efficiency is doubled. Due to the implementation of the attendance system, which stipulates full attendance rewards, no rewards for absenteeism, and wage deductions, the attendance rate has been greatly improved, reducing preparation work.\n\n    IV. Training Technical Workers and Cadres\n\n    Another key to factory management is to improve and enhance technology. Generally speaking, various factories attach less importance to strengthening technology than to the political work of workers. The responsible cadres of the factory are not proficient enough in business and technology; a certain number of middle-level cadres and technical personnel have not been trained in time. Those who have been promoted are used more and educated less; a large number of new workers have poured into the workers, making skilled workers relatively reduced; therefore, technology is stagnant at a lower level and cannot be quickly improved. The number of people watching spindles in a certain spinning factory is 50% more than the general standard; some factories have very low product quality; and some have wasted raw materials and labor. On the contrary, there is an example of the Andong Silk Weaving Factory, which improved its technology, especially replacing the curved needles and triangular needles used for combing cotton, which made the combed cotton more uniform. The yarn spun reduced \"big bellies\" and the twist was also even. There were fewer breaks during weaving, thus reducing waste, increasing effective work hours, and improving the quantity and quality of products. Workers also increased from one person seeing less than 100 spindles to seeing 300 spindles. And because the work was smooth, the morale was high. At present, relying on schools to train technical personnel cannot completely solve the current urgent needs. Therefore, the main method is that each factory should cultivate and improve them in its own production process. This requires advocating respecting teachers and loving apprentices, strengthening the unity of new and old workers, persuading old workers to be willing to introduce technical experience, and listing taking apprentices as one of the merit conditions. The leadership should organize and summarize technical experience and disseminate it. Existing technical personnel should be respected and united, given certain work responsibilities, politically guided to progress, and given necessary preferential treatment in life, so that they are loyal to the cause and give full play to their technical abilities, and assist in training new technical personnel.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安东召开厂长会议  讨论公营工厂企业化管理问题　决定扩大生产着手恢复重工业\n\n1948-09-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安东召开厂长会议\n    讨论公营工厂企业化管理问题\n  　决定扩大生产着手恢复重工业\n    【新华社东北十四日电】辽东财经办事处于七月中旬召开所属安东区各工厂厂长会议，总结本年度上半年各厂生产工作，并决定下半年的中心任务是扩大生产及着手恢复重工业；会议并提出了对各厂生产量的具体要求。据会议检查，自去年六月安东再度解放后，一年来安东地区国营企业除个别被敌彻底破坏的工厂与某些重工业外，几乎全部工厂已消除了敌人破坏的创痕，生产力平均恢复到伪满时的百分之九十到九十五；有的如某纺织厂开动的纱锭且超过伪满时百分之四十三。由于工人的劳动热忱大大提高，本年上半年的生产成绩与去年下半年比较，均有显著进步。如某纺织厂上半年纺纱总数超过去年下半年的百分之三百；安东丝织厂人造毛皮的产量，则超过百分之一百六十五；赛马煤矿在上半年就完成全年生产任务的百分之八十四。在工厂管理方面，半年来也有很多建树。如安东丝织厂建立了统计表报制度与按级汇报检查制度，严格执行了收支手续与仓库的管理，而厂长就通过这些制度来掌握全厂生产情况。各厂上半年的节约，仅胶皮、丝织两厂即达十三亿余元。但从工厂的企业化管理来看，各厂还或多或少存在着某种无纪律、无计划的状态与手工业的工作作风。会议认为今后极需解决下列各问题：\n    一、成本计算\n    成本计算的正确与否是测量工厂办得好与坏的主要标志。成本计算包括对原料、材料与人工费、财产折旧费、管理费的精确计算。由于有些工厂对实际财产的调查与作价不确实，又未作出财产的折旧率，同时又没有建立或健全经常的原料、材料盘存制度，因而对计算成本的两个要素——原料、材料，与财产折旧的计算就无法确实。其次有若干消耗未计算或未以实价计算在成本内，如铁的原料，因为不用买，定价就特别低；从废品堆里找出的零件或原料、材料被使用或消耗了，也都未计入成本；有些资料则不以目前实价而按原来价格计算成本，因而形成了原料、资料价格低，而成品价格特高的假象。正确的成本计算必须首先精密地调查财产（包括原料、材料盘存及其他财产）并进行作价，以了解工厂的资本总额，再订出财产折旧率。此外必须有精确的工时统计，再按照一定的价格计算出原料、材料、人工、折旧、管理四种费用在各种不同成品中的比率及标准的利润率，并从各种费用所占比率在每个时期上升或下降的原因之中，以研究出减低成本的办法。\n    二、建立统计、表报与检查制度\n    成本计算的精确，必须有健全的统计、表报（按级汇报）与检查制度。有的工厂成本会计只单纯的记帐，没有辅之以调查统计工作，因而对生产过程中所发生的问题无法了解，无法研究成本高或低的原因。如果在各科甚至各股中设置统计人员、实行按级汇报制，健全工作日报与及时的检查工作，便能使负责干部避免事务主义的忙碌，而能每天及时了解缺勤多少，工时损失多少，原料材料出入多少，成品入库多少，废品损失多少，发生什么困难，需要怎样解决等问题；并能及时计算出一件成品中工费与原料材料费的比率与损失率，保证成本计算的精确。\n    三、劳动力的组织\n    有了正确的成本计算后，降低成本的重要问题之一便是劳动力组织与使用的合理化。有些工厂在生产效率上，在原料的节省上，一年来提高了百分之五十至百分之百，但人力仍过多耗费。如赛马煤矿的间接生产人员占全部生产人员的一半，丝织厂一件成品的成本，人工费占了百分之五十五，合理的组织使用劳动力，除必须熟悉机器的效能与改善劳动条件外，主要的是组织与发挥工人群众的劳动积极性。为此有两个方法：一个是立功运动；一个是累进工资制与考勤制度的建立。如某纺织厂一厂规定了各等工资的一定条件，如看多少锭子、质量的标准，爱护机器等后，看一架机器由两人减为一人，效率提高了一倍。由于实行了考勤制度，规定了全勤奖励缺勤不奖并扣发工资等办法，出勤比率大大提高，减少了准备工。\n    四、培养技术工人与干部\n    工厂管理的另一关键是改进与提高技术。一般地说：各厂对加强技术落后于对工人的政治工作。工厂的负责干部在精通业务和熟悉技术上不够；一定数量的中层干部及技术人员没有及时培养起来。已经提拔的也使用多，教育少；在工人中涌进了大批新工人，使熟练工人相对减少；因此技术停滞在较低的水平上，无法迅速提高。某纺纱厂看锭子人数比一般的标准多百分之五十；某些工厂因产品质量很低；有的则因浪费了原料和人工。相反的例子，则有安东丝织厂因改进技术，特别是更换了梳绵用的弯针和三角针，使梳出的绵均匀了，纺的纱减少了“大肚子”，捻度也匀了，织时断头少了，于是减少了浪费，增加了有效工时，提高了产品的数量和质量，工人也由一个人看不到一百锭子增加到看三百锭子，并因工作顺利，情绪高涨。在目前要依靠学校来培养技术人员是不能完全解决当前迫切需要的，因而主要的办法是各工厂应在自己生产过程中来培养提高。这就必须提倡尊师爱徒，加强新老工人团结，说服老工人乐意介绍技术经验，并把带徒弟列为立功条件之一。领导上则要组织与总结技术经验，予以传播。对现有技术人员要尊重与团结他们，给以一定工作责任，政治上引导其进步，生活上予以必要优待，使其忠于事业，发挥其技术能力，并协助培养新的技术人员。"

He recently wrote to a certain unit's \"Zhan Wei Bao\" (Combat Guard Newspaper) to instruct them on how to run a good military newspaper. In his letter, he pointed out: \"The newspaper is a leadership tool, not a literacy textbook. Leaders who pay attention to mass work often value the role of newspapers, using newspapers to unite, educate, and organize the masses to complete the current political tasks.\" \"A good and reputable newspaper is one that is connected with the masses and concerned by the masses,\" and \"it will play a great leading role in completing certain political tasks.\" \"Newspaper workers who do not have this basic idea often regard the newspaper as purely 'cultural' work, and their cultural work in their minds is for the sake of cultural work.\" Deputy Commander Zhang believes that the content of military tabloids \"should mainly educate the masses with the deeds of the masses,\" followed by the calls of the leading organs and leaders, materials from neighboring units, and current affairs news. \"When writing about the deeds of the masses, it is not the editor's fabrication, or out of interest, nor is it a record of everything heard among the masses; but to find typical examples among the masses.\" It is necessary to be good at praising, promoting, and improving typical examples that are active and creative, so that the masses can learn; it is also necessary to be good at exposing backward and failed typical examples, so that the masses pay attention to overcoming and being vigilant. \"When writing calls, be concise, to the point, and easy to understand, and avoid the style of writing editorials in large newspapers. When writing materials from neighboring units, it should be limited to outstanding typical examples. When publishing news, it should also be limited to particularly important victory news. In short, the material should be suitable for the nature of the tabloid and suitable for the reading of the target audience.\" He also pointed out that in the newspaper's recent four issues, each issue had a long article, occupying one-half or two-thirds of the newspaper's space; the material was divorced from the soldiers, who are the newspaper's basic audience. In the four issues, there was only one article reflecting the soldiers of the company, and the rest were articles reflecting cadres and office staff.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: Comrade Dong Cunrui, squad leader of the Sixth Squad of a certain unit of the Jicha-Rehe-Liao Liberation Army, sacrificed his life to destroy a strong enemy bunker, playing a significant role in the battle to liberate Longhua City in Western Rehe at a crucial moment. On May 26th, during the Longhua battle, as our army approached the core fortifications of the Kuomintang city, the enemy's group of hidden and exposed bunkers in the northeast corner, and a bridge-like bunker built over a shallow trench, blocked our army's advance. They fired a crossfire network, making it difficult for our army to approach. Two demolition teams were sent up continuously but failed to complete their mission. If this bridge-like fortress could not be destroyed, the battle could not move forward, and it would be impossible to finally annihilate the enemy concentrated in the core fortifications. At this time, Communist Party member Comrade Dong Cunrui, disregarding the fatigue from completing the previous two demolition tasks and the platoon leader's dissuasion, resolutely requested to continue to take on the task of destroying this bridge-like fortress. After receiving permission, he wiped his sweat, picked up the dynamite box, and rushed to the enemy fortress. However, at the time, there was nothing else to support the explosives in the middle of the fortress, and placing them below would not destroy it. Comrade Dong Cunrui then displayed the high spirit of self-sacrifice of the proletariat, without hesitation, holding the dynamite box with one hand and pulling the fuse with the other. In a deafening roar, the fortress was destroyed, and our excellent Communist Party member Comrade Dong Cunrui also gloriously sacrificed himself, becoming immortal. This heroic feat inspired the entire troop to intensify their fire of hatred against the enemy. The assault team immediately followed his bloody trail, rushed into the enemy's formation through the thick smoke, and finally occupied the enemy's core fortifications, capturing more than 130 enemies on the spot, seizing more than ten machine guns and submachine guns. The remaining enemies who broke through and fled were also completely annihilated by another part of our army, gloriously completing the task of occupying Longhua City, an important stronghold outside Chengde.\n    Comrade Dong Cunrui was from Nanshanbao Village, Huairou County, Chahar Province. He was twenty years old. Born into a poor peasant family. He joined the army in February 1945 and joined the Chinese Communist Party a year later. He had been credited with three major merits in the battles of Dushikou, Fuxintun, and Nanwanzi. He usually worked hard to train soldiers. In two grenade throwing and shooting practices, he was the first in the whole company, and he also worked hard to learn about explosives. He was also good at uniting soldiers and the masses. Before attacking Longhua, when the unit passed through Toudaogou Village, two women complained to our army about the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang who had killed their husbands, leaving their weak wives and orphaned children unable to survive. At that time, Comrade Dong was filled with righteous indignation and swore: \"We must avenge the people of Rehe at any cost!\" On the eve of the battle, he requested to be the first to carry out the demolition at the soldiers' meeting and finally fulfilled his heroic oath in this battle.\n    Regarding the sacrifice of Comrade Dong Cunrui, Cheng Zihua, Commander of the Jicha-Rehe-Liao Military Region, specially wrote an article of condolence a few days ago and called on the entire army to carry forward his great heroic spirit, strive to improve tactical skills, and strive for greater victories.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 手托炸药箱毁敌碉堡　董存瑞同志英勇牺牲  舍身为革命光荣完成解放隆化任务\n\n1948-09-17\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　手托炸药箱毁敌碉堡\n  　董存瑞同志英勇牺牲\n    舍身为革命光荣完成解放隆化任务\n    【新华社东北十三日电】迟到：冀察热辽解放军某部六班班长董存瑞同志，牺牲自己的生命，只身摧毁敌军坚强碉堡，对解放热西隆化城的战斗，在重要关键起了重大作用。五月廿六日隆化战斗中，当我军逼近国民党城内核心工事时，敌人在东北角的明暗地堡群和一个架在浅沟上的桥状碉堡，阻住了我军的进路；并发射交叉火网，使我军接近困难，当时曾连续上去了两个爆炸组都没有完成任务。如不能炸毁这座桥状堡垒，战斗就不能再向前发展，就无法最后歼灭集中在核心工事里的敌人。这时共产党员董存瑞同志，不顾刚才因完成其他两次爆破任务的疲劳和连长的劝阻，坚决要求继续担任炸毁这一桥状堡垒的任务。他得到允许后，抹了抹汗，就抱起炸药箱子冲到敌堡垒跟前，但当时没有别的东西可以把炸药支在堡垒中间，而放在堡垒下面，则又炸毁不了它。董存瑞同志于是发挥了无产阶级的高度自我牺牲精神，毫无犹豫的一手托住炸药箱，一手拉开导火线，在震天的一声轰响中，堡垒被炸毁了，而我们优秀的共产党员董存瑞同志也永垂不朽地光荣牺牲了。这一英勇壮举，激动了全体指战员的杀敌烈火，突击队马上踏着他的血迹，随着浓烟冲进敌阵，终于占领了敌人的核心工事，当场俘敌一百三十余名，缴获机枪冲锋枪各十余挺，突围逃窜的残敌，也经另部我军全数歼灭，光荣地完成了占领承德外围重要据点隆化城的任务。\n    董存瑞同志是察哈尔省怀柔县南山堡人。现年二十岁。出身于贫农家庭。一九四五年二月参军，一年后加入中国共产党。他先后曾在独石口、复新屯、南湾子诸次战斗中立过大功三次。平时刻若练兵，两次投弹射击都是全连第一名，对学习爆炸也很用功。并善于团结战士和群众。在进攻隆化前，该部途经头道沟村时，曾有两个妇女向我军控诉蒋介石匪帮残杀了她们的丈夫，致使弱妻孤子无法过活的罪行。当时董同志即义愤填胸，宣誓：“不惜任何牺牲，定要为热河人民报仇！”战斗前夜，他在军人大会上要求第一个担任爆炸，终于在这次战斗中，实践了自己的英雄誓言。\n    对于董存瑞同志的牺牲，冀察热辽军区程子华司令员特于日前撰文悼念，并号召全军发扬他的伟大英勇精神，努力提高战术技术，以争取更大的胜利。"

    "content": "[Taiyue Electric Dispatch] The Qin County Party Committee issued a commendation for model Branch Secretary Wen Ruyu and Labor Hero Cao Tianbao, calling on all county branches and party members to learn from their example of leading and uniting all social strata to develop production and prosper. Comrade Wen Ruyu is the branch secretary and cooperative manager of Shihe Village, consistently loyal to the Party and responsible to the people. The Shihe Cooperative was established on a trial basis in 1942, but suffered four failures due to incorrect policies. In August of last year, Comrade Wen Ruyu was determined to run the cooperative well, reviewed the lessons of the failures, and established a policy of developing production. First, he and Wen Changyi, Wang Sanyi, and others used their own capital to try their best to run an oil pressing workshop, earning more than 30,000 yuan. With this as capital, they founded the cooperative, organizing the masses for transportation and sideline production in addition to oil pressing. Because the policy was correct, they earned a lot of money and were supported by the masses. As a result, the cooperative gradually developed and integrated with agricultural production. Secondly, Comrade Ruyu worked hard and never used public property for personal gain. Thirdly, Comrade Ruyu was able to consult with everyone on everything. During the land reform movement, whether it was struggle or the distribution of fruits, he would consult with everyone to make decisions. The same was true in leading production. Under the influence of Comrade Ruyu's exemplary style, all the cadres in the village were able to endure hardship before enjoying comfort, and were able to unite the masses. Comrade Cao Tianbao is the branch secretary of Bao Village, born a tenant farmer, and has a hardworking and dedicated work style. After the land reform movement, he devoted all his efforts to leading and uniting all social strata in production.

    "content": "[Ji Zhong Electric] Zhang Liuguozhuang in Shen County fairly and reasonably distributed land and floating wealth during the Qingming Festival earlier this year. The seven middle-peasant households whose interests were violated due to misclassification of class status also received compensation in April. The county party committee then decided to issue land certificates in this village to create experience. The issuance began on August 14th and partially completed by early September. The working process and experience are introduced as follows:\n\nWhat are some of the problems encountered when issuing land certificates?\n\nAt the beginning, the village peasant representative conference was used to spread the news of issuing land certificates throughout the village. From the brewing process, we understood that the masses had different ideas and requirements: poor peasants and well-to-do middle peasants were very happy, and landlords and rich peasants were also happy. Poor peasant Zhang Liancai said: \"Based solely on official documents and seals, I was allocated six mu of land, without any license. This time, with the land certificate issued, I can be more assured in farming.\" Well-to-do middle peasant Zhang Baoshen said: \"With the land certificate issued, I won't feel so uneasy about farming.\" Landlord Zhang Gengquan and rich peasant Zhang Zhongxun, because they were not called to participate in the mass meeting, randomly found cadres after the meeting to ask: \"Will you issue land certificates to us? With the land certificate issued, our own things will be secure.\" Some middle peasants were not enthusiastic about issuing land certificates, some said: \"Our land has already been taxed and deeded, why bother with that trouble?\" Old middle peasants Zhang Ruxian and Zhang Ruiyan said: \"Let's exchange it if we're told to, anyway, we're following the trend!\" Some thought they would have to pay deed tax, so they had concerns. (According to usual circumstances, in areas where land reform has been completed, the government's issuance of land certificates to determine land rights must be supported by all classes, but the middle peasants in Zhang Liuguozhuang are not active. In addition to \"trouble,\" are there other reasons? Whether correcting misclassified class status and compensating middle peasants have some outstanding issues that have not been resolved, resulting in dissatisfaction among middle peasants? Local leaders should pay attention to in-depth inspection – Editor). In order to unify the masses' understanding of issuing land certificates and discover specific problems, various meetings were held continuously. First, a village-wide mass meeting was held, proposing: (1) Determine land rights to reassure all classes to engage in production, abolish old documents, and ensure men and women have equal economic status. (2) After the land reform, everyone has a share of land. Should land certificates be issued to each individual or to the whole family? You can convene a family meeting to discuss and determine, to achieve family unity and harmony. (3) Issuing land certificates does not require deed tax. Finally, everyone was called upon to raise any land disputes they might have. Secondly, a village-wide women's congress and different women's forums were convened. Later, small group meetings were held among the masses, casually discussing the specific issues in issuing land certificates: 1. All land that has not been measured must be measured. 2. How to issue land certificates for land without contracts. 3. What if the area of land with contracts is less than actual. 4. Most of the villagers do not have contracts, and some have incorrect sizes due to family division. How to issue? 5. If land certificates are issued to each person in the family, it is not easy to distribute the good and bad land evenly. Therefore, the majority opinion is to write the names of all family members on one certificate. Some groups proposed to only write the name of the head of the household, followed by the number of men and women in the whole family.\n\nIn order to complete this task, a \"Land Certificate Issuance Committee\" was established, and a committee and chairman and vice-chairman were elected. Based on the actual situation of land issues in the village, it was decided to establish propaganda, measurement, registration and accounting, and problem-solving groups, each with a group leader and a number of members according to the workload of each group. After the meeting, the radio station was used to inform the whole village of the organization for issuing land certificates, and asked each household to prepare their contracts for registration.\n\nThe work of each group was combined to mobilize the masses to solve disputes themselves. At the beginning, door-to-door registration was carried out. In order to create experience, on the first day, only one group (cadres of the registration group) carried out demonstration registration in one neighborhood. Because the publicity and preparation work was not good, some people were unwilling to discard the old contracts and refused to register. As a result, only eleven households were registered in one day. That night, a meeting of all cadres was held to discuss the issue of not having contracts and how to proceed with the work the next day. Everyone unanimously agreed to respect the village's custom of \"giving priority to those with written contracts, and giving priority to red deed land.\" After this decision was made, it was immediately broadcast throughout the village, urging everyone to quickly prepare their documents. When the measurement group started measuring land, many people requested measurement. Some households whose land had no problems also requested measurement to feel at ease. At this time, the measurement group called on the masses to measure themselves. The measurement group only measured the land of households whose disputes could not be resolved. Many people measured their own land. Because the masses had accumulated problems for many years, some problems that had been solved earlier were overturned, so many problems could not be cleared up. At this time, the problem-solving group explained to the masses: Problems do not necessarily have to be solved by the problem-solving group, everyone can help each other to solve them. Later, many people solved the problems themselves. Only problems that the masses could not solve were brought to the problem-solving group. After more than ten days, the problem-solving group handled forty problems. The measurement group also measured the land that had to be measured and handed it over to the registration and accounting group for registration and conversion to new mu.\n\nBecause the autumn harvest had arrived, the registration and accounting could not be fully completed. In order to demonstrate the experience of issuing land certificates, thirty-five households were selected for review by the county government, the land certificates were stamped, and a small meeting of household heads was convened. At the meeting, the importance of invalidating old documents and issuing land certificates was explained, and then the certificates were issued to everyone, who voluntarily took out their old documents to exchange for land certificates. Poor peasant Liu Dechang, after receiving the land certificate, held it in both hands and said: \"This year's allocated land and my house are all on this, this is my lifeline.\" Some also said: \"Now that the land certificate has been issued, let's work hard! Living a good life is for ourselves.\"\n\nThe peasants who received the land certificates said: \"Let's work hard! Living a good life is all for ourselves from now on.\"\n\nSolution to Several Specific Problems: (1) For land and houses without documents or with lost documents where the wide-scale size is unknown, first measure the land adjacent with documents, determine the boundaries, and then measure. Write down as much as one has on the land certificate. If two adjacent plots of land have no wide-scale deeds, first measure the land adjacent to those two plots, determine the boundaries, and then those two plots will use the existing planting edges as the boundary. Whoever plants the crops harvests them, and new boundaries will be established after the autumn harvest. The above method is the old custom of the masses, and the masses agree. (2) If a contract is not presented, first measure the land adjacent to it, determine the boundaries, and then calculate how much is there, but declare: If the contract is not presented today, it will be equivalent to waste paper in the future. (3) For those who are preparing to divide the family after the autumn harvest and need each person to have their own land certificate, the problem-solving group will help to divide the land first, and after measuring and determining the boundaries, each will establish a new name and register their own. (4) Clan land issues. For clan land without graves, if ownership has been determined, the land certificate will be issued to whoever owns it. For clan land with graves but also vacant land, such land is to be obtained with the consent of the clan, determined to be collectively owned by the clan, and the clan's public name will be written on the land certificate. The right to use the land is to be reasonably distributed for cultivation after discussion and agreement by the clan. (5) Writing names issue. In order to implement anti-feudalism, women are encouraged to write their names on land certificates to break the feudal idea that \"women cannot use paper and pens.\" Eight women in this village voluntarily requested to issue land certificates separately. Some wrote the names of the whole family on one land certificate, while others only wrote the name of the head of the household, followed by the number of men and women. (6) For lazy wives and lazy men, they only have the right to use the land. The land certificate is kept by the peasant association and will be issued after they are transformed. (7) Issues that should be paid attention to when issuing land certificates: (1) Before issuing the certificates, the significance and purpose of issuing the certificates must be explained to eliminate the masses' illusions about old documents and establish the masses' trust in the land certificates issued by the democratic government. (2) Let everyone speak and seek the consent of the individual and the family, and do not create disputes among families and masses for the sake of issuing land certificates. (3) Registration, measurement, and conversion to new standards must be carried out, but should be carried out separately depending on the circumstances, and combined with each other. Do not mechanically divide into several stages. If there are no problems, it can be written directly on the land certificate, and only those with problems will be measured, etc. (4) It is necessary to mobilize the masses to solve disputes themselves. Relying solely on the problem-solving group to solve them is not enough. (5) Issuing land certificates to women alone carries great significance in implementing the spirit of anti-feudalism and improving the economic and political status of women. However, women should not be forced to propose it, but should be educated to consciously propose it, and try to obtain the consent of the family to avoid being separated from the masses and causing family disunity. Parents should be told: This is to prevent disputes for children in the future and reduce anger.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 确定地权发展生产　张刘郭庄颁发土地证\n\n1948-09-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　确定地权发展生产\n  　张刘郭庄颁发土地证\n    【冀中电】深县张刘郭庄，今年头清明节就公平合理的分配了土地和浮财。错定成份而侵犯了的七户中农，今年四月里也进行了补偿工作，县委乃决定在这村颁发土地证创造经验。从八月十四日开始至九月初，已经颁发一部。现将工作过程和经验介绍如下：\n  发土地证时都有些什么问题？\n    开始先通过村农代会把发土地证的消息传遍全村，从酝酿中了解群众有不同的思想情况和要求：贫农、富裕中农都很欢喜，地主富农也高兴。贫农张连才说：“单凭文书官凭印，俺分了六亩地，什么执照也没有，这回要发给土地证，以后种地可就更放心了。”富裕中农张保申说：“发了土地证，种着地心里也就不敲小鼓了。”地主张根全和富农张仲勋，因为开群众大会没有叫他参加，会后便乱找干部问：“给俺发土地证吗？发了土地证，自己的东西就牢靠了。”有的中农对发土地证的态度不积极，有的说：“俺们的地才税了契，找那个麻烦干什么？”老中农张汝贤、张瑞延说：“让换就换，反正是跟潮流走吧！”有的以为要拿税契米，所以有顾虑。（按通常情况，在土改已经完成地区，政府颁发土地证，确定地权，必为各阶层所拥护，但张刘郭庄的中农却不积极，除“嫌麻烦”以外，是否还有其他原因？是否改正错订成份，补偿中农有些什么遗留的问题未获得解决，以致引起了中农不满？当地领导应注意深入检查——编者）为了统一群众对发土地证的认识，并发现具体问题，连续召开了各种会议。首先召开全村群众大会，提出：（一）确定地权，使各阶层安心生产，废除旧文书，男女要有同等的经济地位。（二）土改后人人有一份土地，土地证是一人发一份呢？还是全家发一张呢？可召开全家会议商量确定，作到全家团结和睦。（三）发土地证不要税契米。最后并号召大家还有什么土地纠纷问题，都提出来。其次召开全村妇女大会，和不同的妇女座谈会。后又在群众中召开小片会，漫谈了发土地证中的具体问题：一、没有丈量过的全要丈量。二、没有契约的地这回怎么发土地证。三、有契约的地数少了怎么办。四、这村的庄户大部分没有契约，有的因分家，尺码也不对了，怎么发。五、土地证如全家一人一张，地的好坏配搭平均不容易。所以多数的意见是把全家所有的人名字写上就行了。有的组提出，只写家长的姓名，然后写上全家男女人数。\n    为了完成这个任务，特建立“发土地证委员会”，选出委员会与正副主任。又按本村土地问题中的实际情况，决定下设宣传、丈量、登记核算、处理问题等股，各股设股长一人，股员多少按着各股工作的轻重聘请。会后利用广播台将颁发土地证的组织告诉全村，并让各户准备拿契约来进行登记。\n    各股工作互相结合，发动群众自己解决纠纷。开头先进行挨户登记，为了创造经验，头一天只有一个组（登记股的干部）在一个闾里进行示范登记。因事先宣传准备工作不好，所以群众有的不愿把旧契约作废，便推托不登记，结果一天只登记了十一户。当天晚上开了个全体干部会，讨论没有契约的问题，和第二天的工作怎么办。大家一致意见是尊重本村习惯“没有文契的要先尽有文契的，先尽红契地。”这样决定后，立即广播全村，让大家赶快把文书准备出来。为了集中力量搞登记，就把四个股里的干部全动员起来，分了四个小组进行。第二天工作开始后，推托说找不到文书的，觉着自己要先尽有文书的，都赶快把文书找出来了。丈量股里一开始丈量地，要求丈量的很多。有些户的地本来一点问题也没有，他也要求丈量才放心。这时丈量股便号召群众自己丈量，纠纷解决不了的户，丈量股里才丈量。有好多群众自己就把地量好了。处理问题股因为群众积有多年的问题，早先解决过的有的也翻案，所以也有好多问题处理不清。这时处理问题股就向群众说明：问题不一定非给处理问题股解决，大家可以互尽互让自己解决。后来有好多群众就自己下手解决问题了。只有群众不能解决的问题，提到处理问题股。这样经过十几天，处理问题股处理了四十个问题。丈量股也丈量了必须丈量的土地，交登记核算股进行登记和折新亩。\n    因秋收已到，登记核算不能全部完成，为了示范颁发的经验，便找出了三十五户由县政府审查，把土地证盖好印，召开了一个小型的户主会，在会上讲明旧文契作废和发土地证的重要，然后就发给大家，都自愿的拿出旧文书换了土地证。贫农刘德昌领到土地证后，双手捧着说：“今年分的地和俺的房屋，都在这上哩，这就是我的命根子。”也有的说：“土地证发了，掏劲干吧！过好了日子是自己的。”\n    农民拿到土地证说：“掏劲干吧！以后过好日子都是自己的。”\n    几个具体问题的解决：（一）没有文书和丢掉文书而不知道阔尺的地和房子，先尽有文书的地邻量够，定出地界后再量，自己有多少就在土地证上写多少。如两家并列地全没有文契阔尺，就先尽双方有文契的地邻量够，然后这两家就以现种的地边为地界，有多少算多少，互相找补了地，庄稼谁种谁收，秋后立新界。以上的办法是群众旧有的习惯，群众都同意。（二）有文契不拿出来，就先尽地邻量够，定出地边后，有多少算多少，但是声明：有文契今天不拿出来，将来等于废纸。（三）准备秋后分家的，需要各人拿各人的土地证的，由处理问题股帮助，先把土地分开，经过丈量定出地界，就各立新名，各人登记各人的。（四）族田问题。没有坟头的族田，已经确定所有权的，是谁的就给谁发土地证，有坟头的也有空地，这样的地是征得本族同意，确定为本族公有，在土地证上写上族里的公名。土地使用权经本族讨论同意，合理分配耕种。（五）写名字问题。为了贯彻反封建，号召妇女在土地证上写名字，打破“妇女上不得纸笔”的封建思想。这村有八户妇女自动要求，单发了土地证，有的是把全家姓名写一张土地证上，有的是只写户主姓名，下写男女人数。（六）懒婆懒汉，只有土地使用权，土地证由农会保存，转变后再发给。（七）发土地证应注意的问题：（１）发证前必须讲明发证的意义和目的，肃清群众对旧文契的幻想，建立群众对民主政府所发土地证的信赖。（２）让大家说话，征求本人本家的同意，不要为发土地证而造成家庭中群众间的纠纷。（３）登记、丈量和新标准的折算都必须进行，但应分别情况，互相结合去作。不要机械的划分几个阶段。没问题的，可一直就写到土地证上，有问题的才进行丈量等。（４）必须发动群众自己解决纠纷，只靠处理问题股来解决，力量是不够的。（５）妇女单发土地证，是贯穿着反封建、提高妇女经济政治地位的精神，有很大意义。但不应强制妇女提出，而应教育妇女自觉提出，并尽量取得本家同意，免得脱离群众，使家庭闹不团结。应告诉家长：这是为儿女将来不出纠纷，少生气。"

    "content": "[Jizhong Dispatch] In Yangjia Fangbei, Shulu Eighth District, which has a total of 159 households, eight middle-peasant households had their doors sealed during last year's land reform, and some scattered furniture, bedding, chests, and cabinets were confiscated or requisitioned. Later, when the standards for class division became clearer, only the wrongly designated class status was corrected, and the confiscated items were not compensated. This caused some middle peasants to have ideological concerns and dampened their enthusiasm for production. Recently, when arranging to conclude land reform, a mass meeting was held. Yang Qinghe, the branch secretary, explained to everyone the spirit of correcting wrongly designated class status, compensating middle peasants, and developing production. This was followed by discussions. Some said, \"It's unreasonable for us to divide up what people earned with their own blood and sweat.\" After the meeting, the unanimous opinion was: things taken from middle peasants should be returned if they should be, and compensated if necessary. Then, a careful review and examination was carried out, and all the wrongly designated were corrected. In order to convince landlords and former rich peasants, they were gathered together, and the standards for class division were explained. After the review and assessment of class status, representatives and group leaders convened a unity meeting with the households whose class status had been wrongly designated. At the meeting, the branch secretary first apologized to the middle peasants whose class status had been wrongly designated, and also advised everyone to work hard in the future and not to dwell on this matter. On the spot, middle peasant Yang Lao Ying said, \"This is nothing. If mistakes are made, they are corrected. Large items like livestock and waterwheels were not touched, and now small items are being returned. This is too good.\" Then their clothes, bedding, and some small items were returned to their owners (because they had not yet been distributed). Only some chests and cabinets had already been distributed in January of this year. The general opinion was that everyone's life was not a problem, so no more returns or compensations were made. The middle peasants were very happy with this. Then, the fruits of the struggle were cleaned up and distributed. Among the distribution, 33 middle-peasant households received movable property, and some things were also given to landlords and former rich peasants. They were given enough houses to live in, and they were educated to work hard and produce in the future. Since the movable property was distributed, the masses have been thinking about living a good life. Middle peasant Yang Lao Zheng, after finishing his work in the fields, is also thinking about doing petty trading. His father, Yang Lao Hong, has also become diligent and thrifty, getting up in the middle of the night to collect manure, filling a basket by dawn. He also carries a manure basket when he goes to work in the fields. Middle peasant Li Lao Geng said, \"Before, I just felt that working was meaningless, only thinking about eating and drinking! The poorer the better. Now I've figured it out. In the future, whoever works is honorable, and whoever doesn't live a good life and becomes poor will be ashamed. In the future, I have to be thrifty and work hard.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 补偿错斗户结束土改　杨家方碑生产起了劲\n\n1948-09-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　补偿错斗户结束土改\n  　杨家方碑生产起了劲\n    【冀中电】束鹿八区杨家方碑，共一百五十九户，去年土改时，有八户中农被封了门，把一些零星家具、被褥和箱柜等没收和征收了。以后划阶级的标准明确了，光把订错成份改了过来，没收的东西都没有补偿。这样就使得一些中农思想顾虑不能解除，生产的劲头不高。最近布置结束土改，开了群众大会，支部书记杨清合，把改正错订成份、补偿中农、发展生产等精神和大伙讲了讲，接着就展开讨论，有的说：“人家一点血一点汗做来的东西，咱们分了不合理。”会后一致的意见是：弄中农的东西，该退的就退，该补的补。接着又仔细的评议审查，把错订了的都改正过来。为了让地主旧富农们口服心服，就把他们叫到一块，讲了讲划阶级的标准。审查和评订成份作过了，代表、组长就召集错订成份户，开了一个团结会，会上，支书先向错订成份的中农道了歉，还劝大伙往后好好劳动，不要把这事搁在心里。当场中农杨老应就说：“这不算什么，错了改过来，牲口、水车大的东西都没动，零星东西又要往回退，这就太好了。”接着就把他们的衣服、被褥和一些零星东西等，都退还了本主（因还未分配），只有一部分箱柜等，今年一月里已经分配了，大家的意见，各家的生活都不成问题，就不再退补了。这样做，中农们都挺喜欢。接着就清理分配果实，分配中有三十三户中农分到了浮财，还给地主和旧富农一些东西，分给了他们够住的房子，教育他们往后好好劳动生产。自从分了浮财以后，群众都想着把日子过好。中农杨老争，做清了地里活，还想着做小买卖。他父亲杨老红，也勤俭起来，半夜里就起来拾粪，天明就拾满一筐。到地做活也背着粪筐。中农李老庚说：“以前我光觉得做活没意思，光说吃吧喝吧！越穷了越好。这时候可想开了，往后谁劳动谁光荣，谁不好好过日子，过穷了也丢人，往后可得省俭点，好好的干活。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th. A certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army used democratic reasoning methods to educate a deserter, Xue Taigui, and also examined shortcomings in the leadership methods of the company cadres. Xue is 18 years old, from Jiang County, Shanxi Province, a peasant who was emancipated. Before joining the army, he participated in the farmers' association and the militia, and supported the front lines with the army. He voluntarily joined the army last November and was assigned to a certain company of the unit this March. On June 15th, he deserted. When the squad leader brought him back, he said, \"Squad leader, I made a mistake, but I want to reason.\" At that time, a comrade from the brigade political department who was sent to the company to help work talked with him, comforted him, and guided him to speak his mind. It turned out that on the third day Xue arrived at the company, he was called out by the company commander and asked to self-criticize in front of everyone because he sang during exercises. Once, when he was sick, he asked for leave from the drill ground, but the instructor rebuked him without asking the reason, saying, \"You just came down casually. You've only been a soldier for a few days and you're already getting mischievous.\" This caused him great embarrassment. Once, when the whole company took apart and washed cotton-padded clothes, he went to wash after guarding the post, but everyone had finished washing and assembled. He asked to stay and finish washing, but the squad leader did not allow it, and criticized him at the criticism meeting. The company commander also said in front of the team that he was a \"lazybones.\" On the evening of June 14th, when the squad leader held a squad meeting, he severely criticized him and two other soldiers, saying that they were not united and that there must be a saboteur among them. In this way, he felt both wronged and afraid, so he deserted this dawn.\nAfter learning about the above situation, the comrades of the brigade political department and the battalion political department believed that the leadership should also bear great responsibility for Xue's desertion. This exposed serious oversimplification problems in the leadership style of the company cadres. It was decided to let everyone democratically discuss Xue's desertion issue in order to educate everyone and improve the cadres. First, a meeting of cadres above the squad level was convened to study how to deal with it. At the beginning, some cadres advocated punishing Xue Taigui, but after clarifying the facts, everyone believed that Xue, a liberated peasant who had been trained by the militia, should be an excellent member of the People's Liberation Army. Because he had just arrived in the army, lacked war experience, was not accustomed to discipline and life, and was not proficient in his movements, the cadres provided little help and education to him, but much reprimand, and even mistakenly suspected him of being a saboteur, which led him to desert out of disappointment. Therefore, everyone at the cadre meeting agreed that a soldier like Xue should be educated, and also recognized the shortcomings in the leadership style. Then, a general meeting of all soldiers in the company was held, and Xue reported his thoughts on desertion. Everyone then launched a democratic discussion and mutual criticism. The company cadres made a solemn self-criticism to the whole group for not going deep into the masses of soldiers in the past, not understanding, and therefore not being able to understand Xue's thoughts and emotions, so that there was little help and education, but much criticism. At the same time, it was sternly pointed out that Xue had the mistake of not raising opinions to the leadership and of deserting.

According to the village cadres and residents, this land belongs to the Nonghui (Farmers' Association) of Houzhai Cunbu Village, Fifth District, Nanle County, and has been lying waste for two or three years. Although the two villages are only five li apart, and the wasteland is mostly located on the edge of Xiaoma Village, Houzhai Cunbu Village in Nanle County is not under the leadership of the Jilu Military Region but under the jurisdiction of the Jiluyu Military Region. Consequently, the masses are hesitant to cultivate it. The soil quality of this land is excellent and is not prone to flooding. It is said that in normal years, it can yield over one shi of grain per mu. Based on this calculation, this year's loss amounts to over a hundred shi, which is a significant loss. It is hoped that the leadership of Nanle County will promptly send someone to Houzhai Cunbu Village to conduct an inspection and quickly lead the masses to eliminate this wasteland, ensuring that they do not miss the wheat planting season.

    "content": "Xinji City Committee\n  　Neglects Insect Plague, Causing Losses\n    [This Newspaper's Report] The Xinji City Committee neglected an insect plague and failed to organize the masses to kill the insects in a timely manner, leading to the spread of the disaster. More than 6,000 mu of millet and sorghum leaves were eaten, accounting for 80% of the planted area. Corn has already been partially damaged and the plague is spreading to sorghum and bean fields. When small armyworms, the size of ants, were discovered in the rural millet fields under the city's jurisdiction on August 10th, they were not widespread. The Industry Department of the Municipal Government, together with the farm, immediately convened a forum of old farmers from various streets and villages and initially discussed methods for controlling the insects. However, because the Municipal Party Committee did not effectively lead the killing effort, it did not achieve practical results. Public Security Bureau cadres continued to go to the countryside to conduct household registration surveys, the Armed Forces Department was busy reorganizing the militia, and the Youth League and Women's Department did not break away from their departmental work. They did not participate in the killing themselves, and also occupied some of the village cadres. At that time, the leadership mostly believed that the insects were still small and harbored a mentality of taking chances. After dragging on for three days, the armyworms became larger, more numerous, and more widespread. The Municipal Party Committee then began to pay attention, and cadres began to go to the countryside to urge the masses to kill the insects. However, there was still a lack of in-depth organization and mobilization, and the groups rarely exchanged information or summarized experiences. A few days later, many people, witnessing the severity of the disaster, developed a feeling of disappointment that \"nothing can be done.\" Some cadres showed helplessness. A civil affairs clerk of the government said: \"There are so many insects, they will eat everything.\" But the facts proved that those who grasped the work tightly and improved the methods of killing in a timely manner suffered less losses. Xinji Farm discovered armyworms at the same time, but because they grasped the extermination tightly, various crops suffered very little damage. Wei Hengyun from Huheying Village, a family of three, worked tirelessly day and night to kill the insects, and saved more than ten mu of millet. But these experiences were not promoted in a timely manner. It was not until August 20th that the Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres to examine this sluggish work style, re-allocated forces, introduced experiences, and called on everyone not to slacken and to fight to protect the existing crops.

    "content": "Bianqu Bank Jizhong Branch Issues Instructions\n  　Adjust Agricultural Loans to Support Wheat Planting\n    [Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Branch of the Bianqu Bank has issued instructions regarding agricultural loan work during the autumn harvest and wheat planting season. The main points are as follows: (1) All agricultural loan cadres must fully devote themselves to the autumn harvest and wheat planting work, and jointly promote the supply and marketing cadres of the cooperatives and the Party and government cadres to organize mass production, and help the masses solve difficulties such as wheat seeds, fertilizers, livestock, and farm tools. The main methods: Rely on mutual assistance and borrowing among the masses to organize the private assets of the masses. Loans can only be used as a supplement when the masses still cannot solve the problem after borrowing and adjusting. Methods for adjusting and borrowing among the masses: exchanging coarse grains for wheat seeds, soybean cakes, and sesame cakes. For example, Raoyang plans to transport a portion of coarse grains to wheat-producing areas to exchange for wheat seeds, and mobilize the masses in non-wheat-harvesting areas to exchange coarse grains. In addition, inspire the masses to borrow from relatives and friends. Furthermore, carpenters and blacksmiths can be organized to repair farm tools, which is better than lending new farm tools. Call on the masses to deposit wheat seeds or other physical objects in promotion cooperatives or village cooperatives, and then transfer them to the masses as loans. Both deposits and loans should have interest. Explain to cadres and the masses that loans support mass production, and overcome the concept of charity relief. (2) Upholding the spirit of lending in kind, based on the experience of lending in kind for half a year, directly lending production materials is the best way to ensure that loans are effective and timely for production, and does not stimulate price fluctuations. In this autumn harvest and wheat planting, efforts should be made to lend entirely in kind. All regions should quickly prepare to transform the loans into wheat seeds, fertilizers, livestock and other production materials needed by the masses in a planned manner. (3) Attention should be paid to checking loans that have not been used for production and resolutely recovering them. All non-disaster area loans that are due should be recovered and placed in disaster areas. The masses should also be educated to strive to repay a portion of the loans before they are due to help the masses in disaster areas with production. If there are special difficulties that prevent recovery, the contracts should be renewed and revalued in kind. In principle, loans due in disaster areas should also be recovered. Do not exaggerate the difficulties in disaster areas and fail to collect them. However, for those who have genuinely used the loans for production but have suffered severe disasters, and whose lives would be affected after repayment, the contracts can be renewed and extended. (4) In order not to delay the agricultural season, there must be sound agricultural loan institutions. Therefore, branches should be established quickly where they have not yet been established. Especially in disaster areas, at least one branch should be established in every two districts. Li County and Xian County have proposed establishing specialized cadres in villages to help branches check, recover loans, and understand the situation. This method can be adopted for reference in various places. (5) In terms of loan methods, it is required that loans are good and fast, and the procedures are simple. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the method of agricultural loan cadres and Party, government, and civilian cadres going to the countryside in combination, starting from organizing production, understanding the needs of the masses, and directly distributing loans to households. However, the decision-making on loans and the control of loan amounts, terms, interest rates, and procedures must be reviewed and managed exclusively by agricultural loan cadres to avoid misappropriation, charity, village-centrism, and confusion in loan procedures. (6) Loans should generally focus on villages severely affected by disasters.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 边区银行冀中分行指示调剂农贷扶助种麦\n\n1948-09-17\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　边区银行冀中分行指示\n  　调剂农贷扶助种麦\n    【冀中电】边区银行冀中分行，对秋收种麦期间的农贷工作发出指示。要点如下：（一）一切农贷干部，要全力投入秋收种麦工作，协同推进社供销干部和党政干部组织群众生产，帮助群众解决麦种、肥料、牲口、农具等困难。主要方法：应依靠群众互助和借贷，组织群众私资浮财。贷款只能做为群众借贷调剂后仍无法解决时的补充。群众间调剂互借的办法：以粗粮换麦种、换豆饼、麻饼。如饶阳计划运一部粗粮到产麦区换麦种，发动未收麦地区群众拿粗粮换。另外启发群众自己向亲朋去借。再者可组织铁木匠修理农具，这个办法比贷给新农具还好。号召群众到推进社或村社存麦种或存其他实物，然后转贷给群众，存与贷都要有利息。对干部和群众说明贷款扶植群众生产，克服恩赐救济观点。（二）在掌握贷实精神上，根据半年贷实的经验，直接贷出生产资料，是保证贷款有效及时的用于生产，并不刺激物价波动的最好办法。这次秋收种麦中，应争取全部贷实，各地应赶快作好准备工作，有计划的将款变成麦种、肥料、牲口等群众所需要的生产资料。（三）应注意检查贷款没用在生产上的要坚决收回。非灾区一切到期的贷款，收回来放到灾区去。并应教育群众，对不到期的也争取零还一部，帮助灾区群众生产。如有特殊困难不能收回的，也应重换契约折实。灾区的到期贷款，原则上也要收回，不能夸大灾区困难而不去催收。但对真用于生产而受灾过重，还款后即影响其生活的，可换约转期。（四）为了不误农时，必须有健全的农贷机构。因此，未建立分社的应迅速建立。特别是灾区，至少要求每两个区有一个分社。蠡县、献县提出在村设专门干部，帮助分社检查、收回及了解情况等办法，各地可参考采用。（五）在贷款方法上，要求贷的好贷的快，手续简便。因此必须采取农贷干部和党政民干部结合下乡，从组织生产入手，了解群众需要，直接发放到户的办法。但在决定贷款和贷款数字、期限、利息、手续的掌握上，必须由农贷干部审查专管，以免发生挪用、恩赐、村本位和贷款手续混乱等现象。（六）贷款一般应以受灾重村庄为重点。"

The draft of the Czech Five-Year Plan, scheduled to be implemented next year, has been completed and will soon be submitted to the parliament for approval. The total investment of the new Five-Year Plan will reach 33 billion Czech crowns, and its goal is to increase the level of industrial and agricultural production by 50 percent each compared to this year by 1953.\n    ◇ Since the Czech new government promulgated the Second Nationalization Decree, by the end of July, 2,200 of the 2,700 enterprises that should be nationalized have been nationalized. To date, 4,300 enterprises employing 93 percent of all Czech workers and employees have been nationalized.\n    ◇ Bulgaria's Two-Year Plan is progressing victoriously. In the first half of this year, industrial production exceeded the same period last year by 32 percent, and agricultural production exceeded by 20 percent.

    "title": "Overcoming Waste, Revising the Wage System: Taiyue Rectifies Public Enterprises",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-18",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Taiyue Telegram: To implement the resolutions of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, the Taiyue District convened an industry and commerce conference from August 4th to 30th. A total of 110 representatives attended the meeting, including 13 representatives from private industry and commerce. The meeting enthusiastically discussed the summary report of Comrade Bo Yibo of the North China Central Bureau. In addition to conducting necessary research on the development of private industry and commerce, the meeting focused on examining the operational management, wage system, worker welfare, and other issues in the leadership of Taiyue's public enterprises. The meeting first pointed out the achievements of Taiyue's public enterprises in construction. For example, the match factory was built in three months under extremely difficult conditions, and its output has continuously increased. It can now produce 20 large boxes of matches per day. The spinning mill could not start up due to a lack of carding machines. Later, engineer Li Maoxuan trial-produced a drafting machine, and now it can produce 60 jin of fine yarn per day. Other departments, such as the clothing factory and military factory under the military supply department, have also guaranteed the army's supply under extremely difficult conditions. On the other hand, the meeting severely criticized the serious shortcomings in the operational management of public enterprises: First, serious waste and anarchic indiscipline. For example, in selecting a site for the Kejing Coal Mine, no careful investigation, research, or measurement was conducted. The mine entrance was opened at the junction of two mountains, and after only one month of mining, all twelve mine tunnels were damaged, with an estimated loss of 100 million yuan. This kind of phenomenon was very common in public enterprises in the past. The meeting stipulated that in the future, the establishment of factories, relocation of factories, and mining operations must undergo detailed investigation and measurement, and plans must be drafted based on market sales and other conditions, signed by engineers, and submitted to higher authorities for approval before they can be implemented. The meeting also strictly enforced the planning of the production process and ensured that each employee can consciously complete their plan. If unexpected difficulties are encountered and the plan cannot be completed on time, the superior must be notified in a timely manner. If no notification is made and the plan is not completed, the factory director will be held responsible. Second, the organizational structure is bloated, turning the factory into an \"office\" and \"militarized.\" According to statistics from the 60 factories present at the meeting, non-production and redundant personnel accounted for 40.96% of the total number of employees. Among them, the redundant and non-production personnel in manufacturing plants accounted for 38% of the total number of employees in the factory. A certain factory under the military supply department did not focus on production, but simply emphasized political work, turning the factory into a barracks, with collective speeches every morning and frequent meetings, which affected production. The meeting decided that the inventory of factory property and adjustment of organizational structures will begin in September. In the future, each factory will strive not to employ an incompetent employee. Third, labor, technology, tools, and raw materials were not organized in a planned manner, resulting in serious losses, destruction, and waste. For example, in order to use pig iron, a manufacturing plant cut the iron axles of trains into several sections. When the spinning mill was established, it recruited many apprentices, thinking that apprentices were easy to lead, ideologically pure, and had low wages. However, due to their low skills, they damaged more than 1,000 jin of cotton while spinning a total of 300 jin of yarn in the first two months. These phenomena are stumbling blocks that hinder public factories from improving production and moving towards enterprise management. In the future, the organization of labor, technology, tools, and raw materials must be strengthened to achieve the goal of increasing production and reducing costs. In addition, the meeting also examined the current wage system in public enterprises, which also violated the principle of developing production. There were two extremely unreasonable manifestations: First, wages were determined not based on production technology and contributions to actual production, but according to class origin. Therefore, the wage system was egalitarian, which greatly affected the improvement of production technology. Second, the phenomenon of mismatch between grades and skills was common in various public enterprises. The main reason was that there was no skill assessment system in the past. Grades were determined not based on skills, but based on the length of working time, the degree of personal difficulty, and the number of family members. Therefore, people with high skills were dissatisfied, which reduced production efficiency. The meeting sharply criticized this egalitarian and purely relief-oriented view and decided to determine wages based on the skill level of production technology and the contribution to actual production. There should be a regular skill assessment system. Any worker whose skills have improved can have their grade raised. It was also decided to organize worker welfare undertakings, mainly by organizing production cooperation and organizing the production of workers' families.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服浪费现象改订工资制度　太岳整顿公营企业\n\n1948-09-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　克服浪费现象改订工资制度\n  　太岳整顿公营企业\n    【太岳电】为贯彻执行华北工商业会议的决议，八月四日至三十日，太岳区召开了工商业会议。出席会议的代表共一百一十位，其中有私营工商代表十三位。会上热烈讨论了华北中央局薄一波同志的总结报告。除对私营工商业的发展问题作了必要的研究外，着重检查了太岳公营企业领导中的经营管理、工资制度、工人福利等问题。首先指出太岳公营企业在建设中的成绩。如：火柴厂能在极端困难的条件下三个月建设起来，产量不断提高，现在每日能产二十大箱火柴。纺纱厂机器中因缺少梳棉机不能开工，后来李茂轩工程师试制了拉条机，现在每日能产六十斤细纱。其他如军供部门的被服厂、军工厂也都在极端困难的条件下保证了军队的供给等等。另一方面严格批评了公营企业经营管理中的严重缺点：第一、严重的浪费和无政府无纪律现象。如磕井煤矿在选择地区上，没有经过慎重调查研究和测量，把窑口开到两座山的接合部，只下了一个月煤，十二个煤洞就都坏了，估计损失一亿元。这类现象在过去公营企业中是很普遍的。会议规定今后设厂、移厂、开采矿山，必须经过详细调查测量、根据市场销路等条件拟订计划，经过工程师签字，送交上级批准，然后才可实行。并严格生产过程中的计划性，并使每个职工能够自觉完成自己的计划。如发现意外困难无法按期完成计划时，应及时向上级声明，如不声明，又完不成计划，厂长要负责任。第二、组织机构庞大，把工厂“机关化”“军队化”了。据到会的六十个工厂统计：非生产及多余人员占总人数百分之四十点九六，其中制造厂的多余人员和非生产人员竟占到全厂人数百分之三十八。军供部门某厂不从生产着眼，单纯强调政治工作，把工厂变成兵营，每天早晨集体训话，开会又多，影响生产。会议决定九月份要开始清理厂内财产，调整机构。今后各厂力求不用一个不称职的员工。第三、没有把劳力技术、工具、原料有计划的组织起来，造成严重的损失破坏浪费现象。如制造厂为了要用元铁，把火车上的铁轴截成几节。纺纱厂开办时吸收学徒多，总以为学徒好领导，思想纯洁，工资低。但因技术低，在初创的两个月共纺三百斤纱，就损坏了一千多斤棉花。这些现象是障碍公营工厂提高生产、走向企业化的绊脚石。今后必须加强劳力、技术、工具、原料使用的组织性，作到提高生产、减低成本的目的。另外又检查出公营企业中现行的工资制度，也违背了发展生产的原则。有两种极不合理的表现：一、规定工资不是根据生产技术和对实际生产的贡献，而是按照成份出身，因此工资制度是平均主义的。这就大大影响了生产技术的提高。第二、各公营企业中普遍发生等级和技术不符合的现象，主要原因是过去没有考工制度，不看技术只看工作时间长短及个人困难程度、人口多少等划分等级，因此技术高的人不满，降低了生产效率。会议尖锐的批评了这种平均主义、单纯的救济观点，决定按生产技术的熟练程度和在实际生产上的贡献来决定工资。要有定期的考工制度。任何工人技术有了提高，等级就可以提高。又确定举办工人福利事业，主要靠组织生产合作，组织工人家属生产来解决。"

His family has 24.5 mu of land, with a family of five and one laborer. During the discussion of providing land cultivation for military dependents in our village, it was decided that he should return the land to other military dependents. In this case, should his family be considered military or industrial dependents, and should they be provided with land cultivation by others?\n　　　　　　　　\n　　                                      Lincheng Qi Village, Yan Qingshou\n\n    Answer: This question has been answered by Comrade Huo Xiuwen of the Civil Affairs Department of the Border Government as follows:\n    According to what you said, Liu Xiaodong's elder brother was introduced by the district to work as an apprentice in the iron factory of the Military Industry Department. Treating him as an industrial dependent is inappropriate. If he is a military ordnance worker on the supply system and has obtained military status, he should be treated as a military dependent. If he is a salaried worker and has obtained military status, he can only enjoy the political treatment of a military dependent, but not material subsidies and land cultivation. Otherwise, he can only enjoy the factory insurance law and cannot enjoy military dependent status. Therefore, according to the situation you described, he is working as an apprentice in the factory, and it is unlikely that he has obtained military status. If he has obtained military status, it can be handled according to the above principles. If he has not obtained military status, his family members should perform land cultivation duties like the general public.\n　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 军工厂学徒的家属是否算军工属？\n\n1948-09-18\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　军工厂学徒的家属是否算军工属？编辑同志：\n    我村刘小东，他的哥哥刘秋成，于前年正月经区上介绍，到军工部铁工厂当学徒，他家有地二十四亩半，人五口，有一个劳力。这次本村讨论给军属代耕地问题，经研究叫他还给别的军属代耕，这样他家是否算军属或工属，应不应给别人代耕？  　　　　　　　　\n　　                                      临城祁村阎庆寿\n    答：这个问题已请边府民政厅霍秀文同志答复如下：\n    据你所谈刘小东的哥哥在家经区上介绍到军工部铁工厂当学徒，按工属待遇是不妥的，如系供给制的军火工人且已取得军籍者，应按军属待遇，如系薪金制且已取得军籍者，只可享受军属之政治待遇，不得享受实物补助和代耕。否则，只可享受工厂保险法，不能享受军属地位。所以按你所说的这个情况，是到工厂当学徒，恐不一定取得军籍，如已取得军籍，即可按以上原则处理，如未取得军籍，其家属应与一般群众一样服代耕勤务。　　　　　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: TASS reports: The Soviet embassies in London, Washington, and Paris were instructed on the 4th of this month to inform the British, American, and French governments that, since the Four Powers' Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference has concluded its work on the issue of the former Italian colonies, and in accordance with the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty, the Soviet government considers it necessary to consider the issue of the former Italian colonies at a Foreign Ministers' Conference, in accordance with the order prescribed by the treaty, before the expiration of the treaty-stipulated deadline, that is, before September 15th of this year. Note: According to the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty, which came into effect on September 15th of last year, the issue of the Italian colonies should be resolved by the Four Powers' Foreign Ministers within one year of the treaty's entry into force; otherwise, it will be submitted to the United Nations for handling. For a year, the US and British sides have consistently adopted delaying tactics on this issue. Although the Deputy Foreign Ministers have met many times and conducted extensive investigations in the former Italian colonies, no results have been achieved, making it necessary for the Foreign Ministers' Conference to resolve the issue directly.\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Since the Soviet government proposed to the United States, Britain, and France on the 4th to convene a Four Powers' Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the issue of the former Italian colonies, the British and French governments replied to the Soviet government on the 7th and 9th respectively, expressing their agreement to hold a meeting in Paris, but did not mention the date of the meeting. In its two notes to the Soviet government on the 8th and 9th, the US government, on the one hand, disagreed with the Soviet Union's proposal to hold the meeting on September 10th, and advocated postponing it to the 13th. On the other hand, it revealed the United States' lack of sincerity towards this meeting. According to TASS: The Soviet government specifically replied to the US government on the 10th, pointing out that the section in the US note which stated \"unless the Soviet government provides new proposals for consideration, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will be useless\" clearly constitutes an attempt by the US to impose certain preconditions on the convocation of the meeting. This arbitrary statement is unacceptable to the Soviet government. The Soviet reply continued: The US declaration that it would authorize the Secretary of State's representative to attend the meeting, and the statement that the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty, and the convening of a Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the issue of the former Italian colonies, are still impossible matters. The reply finally stated that, despite this, the representatives still do not object to holding a Four Powers' Deputy meeting, nor do they object to the date of this meeting in Paris being set for September 13th. Furthermore, the British government adopted the same position as the United States in its second note to the Soviet Union on the 9th, namely that Britain would be represented by Minister of State McNeil, rather than Foreign Secretary Bevin.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 前意属殖民地问题亟须讨论　苏建议召开外长会　美英对此缺乏诚意\n\n1948-09-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　前意属殖民地问题亟须讨论\n  　苏建议召开外长会\n  　美英对此缺乏诚意\n    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社报导：苏联驻伦敦、华盛顿及巴黎各大使馆奉命于本月四日照会英、美、法政府说：由于四强外长代表会议已结束关于前意大利殖民地问题的工作，按照意大利和约规定，苏联政府认为必须在和约所规定的期限满期以前，即是说，在本年九月十五日以前，在外长会议中按照和约所规定的次序考虑前属意大利的殖民地问题。按：依照去年九月十五日起生效的对意和约的规定，意大利殖民地问题应由四强外长于和约生效后一年以内解决，过时即提交联合国处理。一年以来，美英方面对于此一问题始终采取拖延策略，各外长代表虽曾多次集议并曾赴前意属各殖民地作广泛调查，但仍未获结果，以致必须经由外长会议直接解决。\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】自苏联政府于四日向美英法三国建议召开四国外长会议讨论前意大利殖民地问题后。英法两国曾于七日及九日分别复文苏联政府，表示同意在巴黎举行会议，但未提及会议举行之日期。美国政府于其八日及九日致苏联政府的两次照会中，一方面不同意苏联于九月十日举行会议之建议，而主张延至十三日举行，另方面又透露出美国对这次会议的缺乏诚意。据塔斯社讯：苏联政府为此特于十日复文美政府，指出美国照会中所称“除非苏联政府以新的建议提供考虑，外长会议将属无用”一节，显系美国向苏联提出某种召开会议先决条件之企图。这种武断的声明不能为苏联政府接受。苏复文继指出：美国宣称将授权国务卿的代表出席会议一点，并声明对意和约的规定，并且召开外长会议讨论前意属殖民地问题，还是不可能之事。复文最后表示，虽然如此，代表们仍不反对举行四强代表会议，亦不反对这一在巴黎举行的会议之日期订为九月十三日。又讯，英政府于九日致苏联的二次照会中，采取了与美国相同的立场，即声称英国将由国务大臣麦克奈尔代表出席，而非由外相贝文出席。"

One aspect was to help solve problems such as wheat seed and farm tools; the other was to support sideline production to solve the problem of food rations for farmers and livestock feeding. In the waterlogged areas, five counties in the third district alone issued 1.1 million catties of wheat seeds, of which Boxin County issued more than 430,000 catties, which could be planted on more than 32,000 mu, yielding about 6.5 million catties. Guangrao County issued loans of more than 50 million yuan, together with the sideline loans of more than 40 million yuan granted to cooperatives last year, and combined with private funds from the masses, it added more than 2,200 head of livestock this spring. The increase in livestock has not only strengthened sideline transportation in the waterlogged areas of northern Guangrao, helping them overcome the spring famine, but also guaranteed the smooth completion of this year's production. In general loans, 880,000 catties of coarse grains and 88.8 million Beihai currency were issued for the fishing and salt industries, combined with some funds from the fishing and salt farmers' cooperatives, to solve the difficulties of grain for salt farmers and fishing nets and other production tools for fishermen. The original 1,046 salt fields in Wudi and Zhanhua counties increased to 1,579 after the loans; and the output increased from 75 million catties to 300 million catties. Because the loans truly solved the difficulties for farmers, when the loans were due, the farmers actively returned them with dry, good grain.\n　　The issuance of agricultural loans has basically grasped the correct policy line. According to statistics from the four regions of Jiaodong, Luzhong, Binhai, and Binbei, a total of more than 290,000 households received loans, of which poor and hired peasants accounted for 83.58 percent, middle peasants accounted for 14.28 percent, and other components accounted for 2.14 percent. However, many cadres have insufficient understanding of agricultural loans, limiting their work to weighing grain, delivering money, and grasping procedural affairs, while relaxing the central link of correctly determining loan households and loans through the mass line.\n　　In stabilizing finance and regulating prices, the bank has also achieved significant results in the past six months by cooperating with industrial and commercial departments. In the first half of the year, prices in the Shandong Liberated Area rose by only 66 percent; while in the same period, general prices in Qingdao, which was occupied by the enemy, rose more than eight times.\n　　The bank has decided to add 100 million catties of grain to the agricultural loan in-kind fund in its future rural financial work, together with the existing in-kind fund, to vigorously carry out agricultural loan work, and to combine agricultural loans with organizing the masses' labor and funds to engage in production work. The issuance of agricultural loans will be based on the amount of production materials that farmers must help in their planned production, and will be issued on a priority basis according to the strength of the bank. The target of issuance is generally poor and middle peasants, but landlords who actively participate in labor after land reform and rich peasants who have been removed from feudal and semi-feudal exploitation may be given loans with the consent of the masses if they lack production funds and cannot solve the problem themselves. At the same time, loans must be repaid with interest. The agricultural loan interest rate is set at 1.5 percent per month for both in-kind and cash loans starting from this autumn loan, and the interest rate for fishing, salt or other sideline loans is 1.5 percent for in-kind and 1.8 percent for cash. In addition, it is planned to select appropriate locations to help establish mass-based credit cooperatives in rural areas, create experience, and serve as a demonstration for the future development direction of rural banking business. Regarding urban financial work, in the future, public and private industrial and commercial enterprises and transportation industries will be given loans according to their relationship to the national economy and people's livelihood, and mass small-scale loans and cooperative loans will be issued at the same time, and deposit and loan business will be carried out, and remittance business will be established to promote the development of industry and commerce. The Shandong Beihai Bank currently has 145 branches, sub-branches, and offices, of which 50 were added in the first half of this year.\nXinhua News Agency, East China, 12th. The remittance business of Shandong Beihai Bank started on September 1st. It is tentatively set that 25 locations including Huaxian County, Shahe (under Yexian County), Longkou, Shidao, Huimin, Dezhou, Boshan, Zhoucun, Qiandou, and Taian will be the focus of interbank remittance, and Dezhou is designated as the transshipment point between the two major liberated areas of North China and East China. Remittance is divided into two types: bill remittance and telegraphic transfer. Bill remittance is the issuance of a bill of exchange by the local interbank bank, and the payee can collect the money from the paying bank with the bill of exchange; telegraphic transfer is the direct notification of the payee by the bank (the bank charges postage) to collect the money from the paying bank. Remittance fee: 3 per thousand within 200 li, 6 per thousand above 500 li; the highest remittance fee does not exceed 150,000 yuan at a time (if it exceeds, it will still be charged according to 150,000 yuan), and the lowest is not less than 500 yuan. The maximum remittance limit is tentatively set at 10 million yuan. If it is more than 10 million yuan, you must talk to the bank and agree to indicate installment payment on the bill of exchange. This move by Beihai Bank is of great benefit to the public and private trade and capital flow between the two regions of East China and North China.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北海银行掌握正确贷款路线　扶植生产成绩很大  举办汇兑裨益华东华北公私贸易\n\n1948-09-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北海银行掌握正确贷款路线\n  　扶植生产成绩很大\n    举办汇兑裨益华东华北公私贸易\n    【新华社华东十三日电】山东北海银行半年来配合救灾，扶植生产，成绩卓著。上半年共发放各种贷款达一百十三亿元。该行渤海分行今春在灾区发放春季贷款时，农业副业并重，一则帮助解决大麦种、农具等问题；一则扶持副业生产，解决农民的口粮及饲养牲口等问题。在水涝区域仅三分区五个县就发放了一百一十万斤麦种，其中博兴一个县发放了四十三万余斤，可种三万二千多市亩，约收获六百五十余万斤。广饶县发放了五千余万元贷款，连同去年贷给合作社之副业贷款四千余万元，并结合群众私资，于今春新添牲口二千二百余头。牲口的增加，不但使广饶北部水涝区增强副业运输，渡过春荒，且保证了今年生产顺利完成。在一般贷款中，渔盐业贷款发放了八十八万斤粗粮及北海币八千八百余万元，结合渔盐民合作社一部资金，解决盐民粮食及渔民的渔网渔杆等生产工具的困难。无棣、沾化两县原有一千零四十六付盐滩，经贷款后增到一千五百七十九付；产量由七千五百万斤增产到三万万斤。由于贷款真正为农民解决困难，所以贷款到期收回时，农民均以干、好粮食，踊跃交还。\n    农贷的发放基本上掌握了正确的政策路线。据胶东、鲁中、滨海、滨北四个地区的统计，得贷款户共二十九万余户，其中贫雇农占百分之八三·五八，中农占百分之一四·二八，其他成份占百分之二·一四。但也有许多干部对农贷的认识不足，把工作限制在秤粮、送款与掌握手续的事务工作上，而放松了通过群众路线来正确确定贷户与贷款这一中心环节。\n    银行在稳定金融调节物价上，半年来与工商部门协力，亦取得极显著成绩。上半年山东解放区物价仅上升百分之六十六；而同一时期敌占之青岛一般物价则上涨八倍多。\n    该行确定今后在农村金融工作上，新增加农贷实物基金一万万斤粮食，连同旧有实物基金，大力开展农贷工作，并使农贷与组织群众劳力、资金从事生产工作相结合。农贷的发放将一面依据农民计划生产中必须帮助的生产资料数额，一回依据银行的力量实行重点发放。发放对象一般是贫雇中农，但土改后积极参加劳动的地主与已除去封建半封建剥削的富农，当缺乏生产资金自己又无法解决时，经群众同意，并酌予贷款。同时贷款要做到有借有还，并收一定利息。农贷利息确定自今年秋贷开始实物现金贷放，均为月息一分五厘，渔盐或其他副业贷款利息，实物为一分五，现金为一分八。此外准备选择适当地点，扶助建立农村中群众性的信用合作社，创造经验，以作今后农村银行业务发展方向的示范。关于城市金融工作，今后对公私营工商业，运输业，根据其对国计民生之关系如何，分别轻重予以贷款，同时发放群众性小本贷款及合作贷款，开展存放款业务，建立汇兑业务，以促进工商业之发展。按山东北海银行现有分行、支行与办事处共一百四十五个，其中于今年上半年增加的有五十个。\n    【新华社华东十二日电】山东北海银行举办汇兑业务业于九月一日开始。暂定化县、沙河（属掖县）、龙口、石岛、惠民、德州、博山、周村、签都、泰安等二十五处为通汇焦点，并指定以德州为华北与华东两大解放区之转汇点。汇兑分票汇与信汇两种，票汇系由当地通汇银行发给汇票，由收款人持汇票向付款行领款；信汇系由银行直接通知收款人（银行加收挂号邮资）向付款行领款。汇费：二百里以内千分之三，五百里以上千分之六；汇费最高一次不超过十五万元（如超过仍按十五万元照收），最低不低于五百元。汇款最高限额暂定为一千万元。如在一千万元以上得与银行面谈，商定在汇票上注明分期付款。北行此举，对华东华北两区公私贸易，资金流转裨益甚大。"

The number of guests in the village greatly increased, resulting in significant expenses. Also, in Qingyangshu Village in the same district, a vow was made to perform a grand opera during the drought this year to pray for rain, which has now been completed, incurring substantial costs. Is this considered superstition and waste? Should the democratic government prohibit it?\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Jiao Ru, Jianping District 1\n　　Answer: Vowing to perform opera due to illness or praying for rain during drought by performing opera are both forms of superstition and waste. In addition to persuading and explaining to the masses, we should actively organize and lead them to pay attention to hygiene, conduct epidemic prevention, and develop medical services to combat diseases. We should lead, mobilize, and educate the masses to plant trees and grass. During droughts, we should lead the masses to seize water for planting and struggle against the weather. As the culture of the masses gradually improves and scientific knowledge is gradually promoted, they will not resort to vowing to perform opera to pray for blessings from heaven when illness or drought strikes. If, after understanding the principles, the masses still want to vow to perform opera, they should be allowed to do so, but education should continue to be strengthened to break superstition. Forcibly prohibiting it by the government at present will not only be ineffective but may also produce adverse results. And according to the degree of awareness of the masses, gradually improve their democratic consciousness.\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 因旱因病而许愿唱戏者怎办？　\n\n1948-09-18\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　因旱因病而许愿唱戏者怎办？编辑同志：\n    建屏一区曹家庄村有一木作工人，在今年夏天为儿子生病许下口愿唱了三天戏，戏价是一石五斗小麦，并管戏班伙食，全村客人大增，耗费很大。还有本区青杨树村，在今年天旱求雨时，许下唱天大戏，现在也唱完了，所耗费用甚巨。这是否算迷信浪费？民主政府应否禁止？\n    　                        　　　建屏一区乔如\n    答：因病许愿唱戏，天旱祈雨唱戏，都是迷信浪费，我们除了向群众进行说服解释外，更应积极组织与领导群众注意卫生，进行防疫，发展医药事业，和疾病作斗争。领导、发动和宣传广大群众造林种草等，旱时领导群众抢水点种，和天时作斗争。群众的文化逐渐提高，科学知识逐渐推广，因生病或天旱就不会去许愿唱戏而祈求上苍保佑了。若在搞明道理后，如群众还要许愿唱戏，应邀群众去唱，但仍应继续加强教育，打破迷信。目前由政府强行禁止的话，不但不会有效反会产生恶果。并根据群众觉悟程度，逐渐去提高自己的民主意识。\n    　　　　　——编者"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-18",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Jizhong News: In order to enable village-level cadres and party members to correctly accept the instructions of the Central Committee and the North China Bureau regarding the tasks for 1948, and to thoroughly correct deviations and rectify policies, the Jizhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided in July to massively train village cadres and party members. This training aims to prepare them ideologically and organizationally for completing the Party rectification and governance construction, ending land reform, and transitioning to production work in the autumn. Training classes were opened in various counties during the agricultural slack season in July and August. Some counties have already concluded the first phase, and the second phase has begun. The first phase of training for cadres in Shen, Zhao, Gao (cheng), and Su (ning) counties, as well as the village cadre team of the District Committee Party School, involved a total of 1,928 trainees, with training periods ranging from one to twenty days. The main experience was to initially allow trainees to express their opinions freely, with the leadership conducting self-criticism of their work, and then mobilizing the trainees to conduct serious criticism and self-criticism, ultimately resolving pressing ideological and work-style issues. When this approach was adopted, the results were good; otherwise, the achievements were small. The experience of the training classes in the district in resolving cadres' ideological problems is presented below for reference.\n\n　　　　Mobilizing Trainees Must Be Prudent; Indiscriminate Sending and Receiving Makes It Difficult to Succeed\n\nFirst, mobilizing trainees must be prudent and responsible, with strict requirements. The Eighth District Committee of Jizhong stipulated that the trainees should generally be the village branch secretaries, organization, publicity, and deputy chairmen of peasant representative conferences, and production, security, and militia committee members. Those who had served as puppet soldiers or in puppet offices, degenerated cadres, those with unclear political backgrounds, \"lackeys,\" or idlers, and those who were substitutes should not be included. Because the aim was to train a group of key figures in the shortest possible time to enable them to undertake the arduous tasks of Party rectification in rural areas and ending land reform, if there were indiscriminate sending and receiving, it would be difficult for such a short-term training class to succeed. The lessons from Zhao County and Gaocheng County were painful. Among the trainees sent by various districts and villages in these counties were old men in their seventies, sons in their sixties, pregnant women about to give birth, seventeen-year-old children, those who had defected to the enemy and been expelled from the Party but whom the district committee had re-introduced as formal party members, those bringing one or two children and suffering from malaria, and those who were impersonating relatives as substitutes. Of the 488 people sent by Zhao County, 131 were returned due to being unqualified, and ten fled. The reason was a lack of understanding of the significance of this training for village cadres, and fear that village work would suffer after training. Therefore, they mostly sent secondary cadres, and even resorted to deception and coercion to make up the numbers. Some deceived by saying, \"Go to a meeting for seven or eight days and come back.\" Some threatened, \"You are a party member and must obey the organization's arrangements; if you don't go, we'll tie you up and take you.\" Some trainees wasted public funds and brought money casually. Zhao County estimated that more than 80% of all trainees used public funds, and two trainees from Xihe Village in the 11th District brought 30,000 yuan. After reviewing the above shortcomings, the Zhao and Gaocheng County Committees again instructed the districts and villages to oppose this liberal attitude and strictly stipulate the qualifications of trainees to ensure the completion of the next phase of the study plan.\n\nAt the beginning of the term, the leadership clearly announced that all opinions could be expressed regarding the Party rectification, clarifying right and wrong and responsibility, with higher authorities taking responsibility for the mistakes of higher authorities. Because most trainees were dissatisfied with the Party rectification, believing that the Party rectification was \"a mess,\" and that veteran cadres had been taken down. The burden of \"merit\" was very heavy, and they felt that after driving away the Japanese, Chiang Kai-shek drove away half of the country again. They thought that after they had won the country, they were now being turned against. Therefore, some thought, \"Even if we study, we won't work when we go back.\" Some cursed the work teams, and some felt wronged. Among the 682 trainees in Shen County, veteran cadres accounted for the vast majority, including 44 who had been detained, 129 who were dissatisfied with land reform and Party rectification due to incorrect suspensions of party membership or some land being touched, and 278 veteran cadres who were also shouting \"a mess\" due to being affected by confused thinking. These accounted for 66% of all trainees. There were 231 people who supported land reform and Party rectification and worked actively in the villages, most of whom were new cadres, accounting for only 34% of the trainees. Therefore, at the beginning of the term, many people came with the attitude of \"complaining\" and \"seeking redress,\" and some even had thoughts of revenge. At this time, the leadership must treat them warmly, guide and enlighten them, and let them say what they wanted to say as much as possible, without fearing complaints or rushing to criticize them. The leadership should conduct sincere and appropriate self-criticism based on the facts presented by everyone and certain errors in the Party rectification. At the opening ceremony, the Shen County Committee made appropriate self-criticism of the deviations or errors in the Party rectification and called on everyone to humbly examine themselves, adhere to the truth, and correct their mistakes. After these efforts, the trainees gradually calmed down and gradually turned to examining themselves.\n\n　　　　The Leadership Conducts Sincere Self-Criticism; Trainees' Criticism and Self-Criticism\n\nAt this time, it is necessary to rely closely on the emerging activists and better elements to take the lead in self-examination and carry out criticism and self-criticism. The Party School's village cadre team, in connection with the content of each lesson in the party member textbook, reflected on themselves. Initially, some people thought that the rural party should be rectified, but they themselves should not be rectified. When they learned how to be a good Communist Party member and used the six standards of a party member to measure themselves, everyone felt that they had shortcomings and that they should also be rectified. Shen County came up with several topics: (1) Why implement land reform and Party rectification? (2) What deviations occurred in your village during land reform and Party rectification? (3) Are the achievements of land reform and Party rectification greater or the errors greater? (4) What problems exist in your village now, and how should they be resolved? The ideological struggle was very sharp in the discussion. At this time, the main ideological situations were: agreeing that good people should rectify the party, opposing bad people rectifying the party; in villages where Party rectification had deviations, those leading the Party rectification should be blamed. Many veteran cadres regarded themselves as \"heroes,\" complaining and seeking redress, and not examining themselves; some were discouraged and did not work, fearing further Party rectification. In the discussion, activists and better elements were discovered and cultivated, and they were encouraged to give typical reports. These included: 1. The Xili Village branch, which was usurped by the Kuomintang district branch organization member Yuan Xicai, who was a rich peasant, and the rich peasant Hao Shunhua. Upright party members were suppressed, and the mass struggle was obstructed. 2. The Nanhe Le Temple branch, controlled by the hooligan Zhang Huanzhang, embezzled public funds, used coercion, and messed around with women. 3. Liu Zhensheng of Liren Village had personal opinions about Yan Mingzhi, a cadre from a poor peasant background and a demobilized soldier, and Yan deliberately detained him. His parents and wife became ill and died, but he still worked actively, without retaliation or pessimism. 4. Wang Wanjin, a party member and cadre from Xiaolv Village. 5. Guo Zhenqian from West Guanjie, all talked about the ideological transformation from pessimism to active work after being detained. These five typical materials were all reported by the parties involved. After the first two branch materials were reported, the trainees realized the importance of Party rectification and also conducted self-examination in connection with the situation in their own villages. The reports of the latter three typical people had a very profound educational significance for some veteran cadres with pessimistic, negative, and retaliatory emotions. In particular, Liu Zhensheng's report deeply moved everyone. Then, in conjunction with the trainees' ideological situation, a brief summary of the county's land reform and Party rectification was reported, and then Party rectification education was implemented, so that the trainees had a further correct understanding of the past and future Party rectification ideologically, and further deeply examined themselves, carried out criticism and self-criticism, affirmed and promoted achievements, and at the same time carried out a resolute struggle against incorrect thoughts and styles. Rao Yang County also achieved results using the same method, but Suning's failure to pay attention to equipping and cultivating backbones when mobilizing trainees and in the study, therefore, showed weakness in ideological struggle and transformation, and the learning effect was not great.\nDiscovering and Cultivating Activists Typical Reports Enlighten All\n    　　Resolving the Relationship between New and Old Cadres Learning Work Methods and Styles\nIn in-depth self-criticism, two currently urgent problems were solved: First, the issue of the relationship between new and old cadres. In the Shen County training class, there were many old cadres, and the atmosphere of dissatisfaction with the Party rectification prevailed in the early stage of learning. New cadres spoke less at the beginning, but were not convinced in their hearts, saying behind their backs: \"Don't quack, we still have to rectify in the autumn.\" The leadership gradually changed this situation according to the trainees' ideological situation. Through discussion, four relationships were resolved—the relationship between party members and the party, the relationship between the party and the masses, the relationship between new and old cadres, and the relationship between the poor peasant associations and the new peasant associations—generally making the old cadres realize their shortcomings and making a more appropriate self-examination of the deviations in the Party rectification, and achieving preliminary ideological consistency between new and old cadres. Second, the Party School village cadre team specifically studied \"leadership methods and work style\" in order to overcome the bad style of coercion and command. Initially, it was generally believed that coercion and command was not a mistake, anyway, it was not for oneself, not corruption. It was thought that being responsible to the higher authorities meant not being able to be responsible to the masses, that the masses were backward, and giving things was okay, but asking for things was not. Later, after studying the bad results caused by coercion and command, for example, a certain village sent laborers to demolish the Zhengding city wall. The village was small, the number of laborers required was large, and the time limit was short. It was estimated that mobilization would not be successful, so some \"meat head households\" were picked and forced to go. Soon after arriving in Zhengding, they all ran back, offending people and not getting things done. In this way, the trainees slowly realized that the style of coercion and command would separate the party and themselves from the masses and would harm the work! At the same time, the trainees were induced to deeply reflect on themselves, and everyone examined that the village affairs were not easy to handle for the following reasons: First, the cadres were unfair in handling affairs, such as the issue of labor, some people contributed more, some contributed less, and some did not contribute at all, and those who contributed more were unwilling to go. Second, some cadres could not play an exemplary leading role, such as expanding the army, some cadres had three brothers, and none of them went, letting the two brothers go, of course, people would not want to go; and some cadres pretended to take the lead, which also increased the difficulty of expanding the army. Third, there was no preparation in advance, and they only held the Buddha's feet at the last minute, such as the issue of labor, the higher authorities often stipulated a short time and a large task, eager to complete it, without education and mobilization in advance, and they were at a loss when the task came. The trainees realized from the self-examination that the coercion and command caused by the above reasons was the responsibility of the cadres, not the backwardness of the masses. Finally, everyone discussed and concluded that cadres should play an exemplary leading role, not be selfish, and every work should have propaganda and sufficient preparation, unite the active, improve the backward, and educate and criticize the wrong, and jointly abide by the democratic discipline formulated by the masses. This issue was generally understood in theory by the trainees, but not completely in their minds. For example, a few people still said that in some cases, coercion and command were still necessary. This requires education and assistance in future practical work to completely overcome the bad style and gradually establish a democratic style.\n\nEditor's note: (1) It is absolutely necessary for the leadership to review the deviations in the Party rectification and make appropriate self-criticism; however, the achievements of the Party rectification, and the fact that impurities within the Party must be rectified, must be affirmed unswervingly. Only in this way can party members of peasant origin and party members with non-proletarian consciousness be raised to the level of the Party Constitution. (2) Serious criticism and self-criticism must be carried out among party members and cadre trainees. This is an extremely important part of conducting intra-party education; however, it is necessary to distinguish between right and wrong, and to distinguish between the seriousness of errors, whether they are accidental or consistent, conscious or unconscious, etc., and give them respective treatment. Those who are affirmed in the Party rectification, those who are wrong are corrected, and those who are serious are reduced. Without this step, simply solving ideological problems is not enough.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 提高政治思想与整党认识　冀中大量集训村干\n\n1948-09-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　提高政治思想与整党认识\n  　冀中大量集训村干\n    【冀中讯】中共冀中区党委为了使村级干部与党员正确接受中央与华北局关于一九四八年任务的指示，并彻底纠正偏向，端正政策，特于七月决定大量训练村干部与党员，为秋后完成整党建政与结束土改、转向生产工作作好思想准备与组织准备。七、八月间正当挂锄的农隙期间，各县训练班先后开办，有些县第一期已结束，第二期已开课。深、赵、藁（城）、肃（宁）等四县及区党委党校村干队，第一期训练学员共一九二八人，时间一、二十天不等。其主要经验是开始放手让学员发表意见，领导上实行工作检讨，然后发动学员开展严肃的批评与自我批评，最后解决思想上与作风上迫切需要解决的问题。凡是这样做的，效果都好，反之成绩即小。现将该区训练班解决干部思想问题的经验，介绍出来，以供参考。\n    　　　　动员学员必须慎重　滥送滥收很难办好\n    首先动员学员必须慎重负责，严格条件。冀中八地委确定受训人员一般是村支部书记、组织、宣传及农代会正副主席，生产、保卫、武装等委员，不要当过伪军伪办公人员的、蜕化干部、政治面目不清的、“狗腿”、二流子、顶名代替的等等。因为要在最短的时间内，训练出一批骨干分子，使他们能够担当农村整党与结束土改的繁重任务，如滥送滥收，这种短期训练班便很难办好。赵县、藁城的教训是很痛苦的，该县各区村送来的学员中有七十余岁的老翁、六十多岁的儿子；有将上炕的孕妇、十七岁的小孩；有投敌叛变被开除党籍的人、分区委又介绍他为正式党员的；有带着一两个小孩并正发着疟疾的女同志，有子替父，兄替弟顶名冒充的等恶劣现象。赵县送来四八八名中，因不合格退回者一三一名，逃跑者十名。原因是对这次训练村干的意义认识不够，并怕受训后，村里工作受损失，所以便多叫次要干部来，甚至为了凑数，还有欺骗、强迫的等花样。有的欺骗说：“去开七八天会就回来了”。有的威胁说：“你是党员要服从组织调动，不去用绳捆着去”。来的学员有的浪费公款，随便带钱的，赵县估计，在全体学员中用公款的要占百分之八十以上，十一区西河庄两个学员带了三万元。赵、藁县委会检讨了以上缺点后，再次指示区村，反对这种自由主义态度，严格规定学员资格，以保证下期学习计划的完成。\n    开学之始，领导上明确宣布对整党可以发表一切意见，分清是非责任，上级的错误上级负责。因为多数学员对整党不满，认为整党“一团糟”，老干部被整下去了。“功劳”包袱很沉重，觉得打跑了日本，蒋介石又打跑了一半，天下咱们打下来，现在却被搬了“石头”。因此有的想“学习了回去也不工作”。有的骂工作组，有的觉得冤枉。深县六八二个学员中，老干部占绝大多数，内有曾被扣押过的四四名，错停党籍或动了一些土地而不满土改整党的一二九名，因混乱思想的波及一时也跟着喊“一团糟”的老干部二七八名，以上共占全体学员的百分之六十六；对土改整党表示拥护并在村中积极工作的有二三一人，其中新干部较多，仅占学员的百分之三十四。因此，开学之初，不少人是抱着前来“诉苦”“伸冤”的态度，有的并存在报复思想。这时领导上必须热情相待，诱导启发，尽情的让他们说出想说的话，不要怕发牢骚，不要急于批评他们。领导上要根据大家提出的事实及整党中的某些错误，进行诚恳的适当的自我检讨，深县县委在举行开学典礼时，即对整党中的偏向或错误，作了适当的自我批评，同时号召大家虚心检讨自己，坚持真理，修正错误。经过这些努力，学员们便慢慢冷静下来，逐渐转向检讨自己方面来。\n    　　　　领导上诚恳进行检讨　学员批评与自我批评\n    这时要紧紧依靠已涌现的积极分子与较好分子，带头检讨，开展批评与自我批评。党校村干队根据党员课本每课的内容，联系自己，进行反省，最初一部分人认为农村党该整，但自己不该整。等到学了怎样做一个好共产党员，拿出党员的六条标准来衡量自己一下的时候，谁也感到自己有缺点了，认为自己也该整。深县出了几个题目：（一）为什么实行土改与整党？（二）你村土改、整党中发生的偏向？（三）土改、整党成绩大，还是错误大？（四）现在你村存在什么问题，应如何解决？在讨论中思想斗争是很尖锐的，这时主要的思想情况是：赞成好人来整党，反对坏人来整党；整党出了偏差的村，领导整党的人应受到责备。很多老干部以“功臣”自居，诉苦喊冤，不检讨自己；有的灰心丧气，不干工作，怕再整党。在讨论中发现了与培养了积极分子与较好分子，鼓励他们做典型报告。计有：一、被富农成份的国民党区分部组织委员袁西财及富农郝顺花篡夺了的西李村支部，正派党员被压制，群众斗争被阻挠。二、流氓张焕章掌握的南和乐寺支部，贪污公款，强迫命令，乱搞女人。三、利仁村刘振生因此逃亡军人贫农中的干部阎明治有私人意见，被阎故意扣押，父妻二人气病而死，但自己仍积极工作，不报复不悲观。四、小吕邑党员干部王万金。五、西关街郭振谦，都谈了被扣后由悲观到积极工作的思想转变。这五个典型材料，均由当事人亲自报告。前两个支部材料报告后，使学员认识到了整党的重要性，还联系了本村情况，进行检讨；后三个典型人的报告，对存在悲观、消极、报复情绪的一些老干部，有极深刻的教育意义，特别是刘振生的报告，使大家深受感动。接着结合学员的思想情况，报告了该县土改整党的简要总结，再贯彻整党教育，使学员思想上对过去和今后整党均有了进一步的正确认识，并进一步的深刻的检讨自己，开展批评与自我批评，肯定与发扬成绩，同时对不正确的思想与作风作坚决的斗争。饶阳县用同样方法亦收到了效果，但是肃宁因在以前动员学员时及在学习中未注意配备与培养骨干，因此，在思想斗争与改造中表现了软弱无力，学习效果不大。\n  发现培养积极分子　典型报告启发全体\n        　　解决新老干部关系　学习工作方法作风\n    在深入检讨中，解决了两个目前迫切需要解决的问题：第一、新老干部关系问题。深县训练班老干部多，学习初期，对整党不满的空气占了上风，新干部开始发言少，但内心不服气，背后说：“不用呱呱，秋后还得整。”领导上根据学员思想情况逐渐转变这一局面。经过讨论，解决了四种关系——党员与党的关系，党群关系，新老干部关系，贫农团与新农会关系——一般做到了使老干部认识了自己的缺点，与比较恰当的检讨了整党中的偏向，达到了新老干部思想上的初步一致。第二、党校村干队专门学习了“领导方法与工作作风”，以克服强迫命令的恶劣作风。最初普遍的认为强迫命令不是错误，反正不是为了自己，不是贪污了腐化了。认为对上级的任务负责，就不能对群众负责，认为群众落后，给东西可以，要东西就不行。以后研究了强迫命令所造成的恶果，比如某村派夫拆正定城墙，村小要的夫多，限时间又短，估计动员不成，便挑了一些“肉头户”，强迫人去，到正定不久，便都跑了回来，人也得罪人，事也没办成。这样学员们慢慢的认识到强迫命令作风会使党使自己脱离了群众，会使工作受到危害！同时诱导学员深入反省自己，大家检讨出来村里的事不好办，有这么几个原因：第一、干部办事不公，象出夫问题，有人出的多，有人出的少，有的还不出，出夫多的就不愿意去。第二、干部有的不能起模范带头作用，如扩兵，有的干部哥儿三个，一个也不去，让哥儿俩的去，当然人家就不愿去；还有的干部假带头，也给扩兵增加了困难。第三、事先没准备，临时抱佛脚，如出夫问题，上级往往规定时间短，任务大，急于完成，事先没有教育动员，任务一来就抓瞎。学员们从检讨中认识到由于以上种种原因产生的强迫命令，那是干部应负责的，并不是群众落后。最后大家讨论的结果，干部要起模范带头作用，不自私自利，每件工作要有宣传酝酿和足够的准备，团结积极的，提高落后的，教育批评有错误的，通过群众订出民主纪律，共同遵守。这个问题，一般学员在理论上认识了，但在思想上尚未完全搞通，如有少数人还说在某种情况下，还得强迫命令。这就需要在今后实际工作中进行教育与帮助，将坏的作风完全克服掉，将民主作风逐渐树立起来。\n    　　　　　　\n    编者按：（一）领导上检讨整党中的偏向并作适当的自我批评是完全必要的；但对整党成绩，党内不纯必须整顿、应毫不动摇地肯定起来，唯有如此，才能使农民出身的党员及带有非无产阶级意识的党员，提高到党章的水平。（二）在党员与干部学员中，要开展严肃的批评与自我批评，这是进行党内教育极重要的一个环节；但必须分清是非轻重，分清错误大小，偶然的或是一贯的，自觉的或是不自觉的等等，分别给以处理、在整党中处分对者肯定之，错者改正之，重者减轻之，没有这一步骤，单纯解决思想问题，是不行的。"

The newspaper believes that Yugoslav Communist Party members will not succumb to terror and will be able to lead the Party and the country back to the path of cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 真理报等发表评论：铁托集团日趋孤立\n\n1948-09-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　真理报等发表评论：\n    铁托集团日趋孤立\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报八日在题为“南斯拉夫铁托集团的民族主义会走到什么地步”的专文中称：铁托集团现在南斯拉夫共产党中只占少数，其所凭借的不是党的信任，而是南斯拉夫的行政和警察机构。\n    另据电通社华沙讯：波兰工人党中央机关报“人民呼声”十日在题为“南共党内大多数共产主义者反对铁托集团”的社论中说：波兰工人党相信南斯拉夫的恐怖统治将维持不了多久。“越来越多的南共党员了解到南共完全孤立于全世界的工人阶级政党之外；他们知道：南共领导机构正在投奔帝国主义阵营，南斯拉夫正日趋孤立于和平与民主阵营之外。越来越多的南共党员懂得：在南斯拉夫人民的敌人中，戴着爱国主义假面具的民族主义者敌人并不小于外国敌人，铁托集团事实上是较南斯拉夫国外任何敌人更大的敌人。”该报指出：铁托集团对南共忠实党员所施的恐怖手段的加剧，表示它日益恐惧南共党员中的大多数知道铁托集团是党和民族之敌。该报相信，南共党员将不会对恐怖屈服，并将能把党和国家引回到与苏联及人民民主国家合作的道路。"

At the demand of the masses, the City Council was originally scheduled to meet at noon on the 6th of this month to discuss the United Socialist Party's proposal on preparations for Berlin citizens to get through the winter. When the meeting was about to begin on the day, reactionary members of the council and spies pre-arranged by the US side suddenly created disturbances in the meeting place. The director of the political department of the US military command attempted to forcibly close the gate and pushed workers in the guest seats out of the meeting place, intending to incite dissatisfaction among the workers outside the meeting to create riots, but the workers outside the meeting were not provoked. After the spies performed a riotous state, the reactionary speaker Suhr announced that the meeting was postponed indefinitely, and all democratic councilors expressed dissatisfaction with this despicable conspiracy. At 2:30 in the afternoon, Gerschke (United Socialist Party), in his capacity as vice-speaker, announced the opening of the meeting. Littek, chairman of the United Socialist Party caucus, stood up and spoke, condemning the reactionaries for evading discussion of the winter preparations plan. Brand, chairman of the executive committee of the Christian Democratic Party, also issued a statement saying, \"If the majority of the current city council is unwilling to express the interests of the people, responsible individuals outside the current city council must unite and come forward to serve as representatives of the people of Berlin.\" At 6:30 in the afternoon, reactionary councilors who insisted on an anti-people stance actually stole the name of the \"Berlin City Council\" and held their so-called \"Berlin City Council\" meeting in a venue that had been well-prepared in the British-occupied area, and \"resolved\" to hold the Berlin city election on November 14.

The majority of the union's leadership passed a resolution recommending that it not support any presidential candidate, asserting that each union member, local union, or district union should decide on this issue according to its own wishes. The convention severely condemned those union leaders who presumptuously attempted to represent the interests of the people by supporting the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as those who participated in the anti-communist movement launched by these two parties to maintain their political monopoly. The resolution criticized right-wing union leaders for supporting the Democratic Party under the pretext of \"choosing the lesser of two evils.\" The convention rejected the proposal of the union's former president, Emspak, to support Truman as a presidential candidate. The New York Herald Tribune and the New York Times admitted that the majority of the convention supported Wallace. The majority of the convention delegates denounced the conspiracy of the union's right-wing leaders (led by former president Emspak) to undermine the union's activities by using the Taft-Hartley Act, and passed a resolution demanding that the CIO leadership condemn and not support such a conspiracy. The convention re-elected Fitzgerald as the union's president, with Emspak's henchmen only receiving 18 percent of the vote. Furthermore, the executive board of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), which has 100,000 members, passed a resolution by a vote of 19 to 5 at its meeting on September 5th, vehemently denouncing the presidential candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties and condemning the union's president, Quill, for unilaterally announcing his support for Truman without consulting the executive board.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美电气工会开代表大会　反对支持民主共和两党总统候选人\n\n1948-09-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美电气工会开代表大会\n  　反对支持民主共和两党总统候选人\n    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社纽约九日讯：产联三大工会之一的联合电气、无线电工人工会召开代表大会，出席者有代表五十万工人的代表一千人。工会领导机关的绝大多数通过决议，建议不支持任何总统候选人，主张各会员工会或地方工会根据自己的意愿决定此一问题。大会严厉谴责那些支持民主、共和两党独揽人民利益代表权的狂妄企图的工会领袖，以及那些参加该两党为维持其政治垄断而发动的反共运动的人们。决议批评右翼工会领袖在“两害相权取其轻”的借口下支持民主党。大会否决了该工会前主席加莱号召支持杜鲁门为总统候选人的建议。纽约先驱论坛报与纽约时报承认：该大会大多数支持华莱士。大会大多数代表斥责该工会右翼领袖（以前主席加莱为首）图利用塔夫脱——哈特莱法案破坏该工会活动的阴谋，并通过决议，要求产联领袖谴责及不支持此种阴谋。大会再次选举费兹吉拉德为该工会主席，加莱的走卒仅获得百分之十八的选票。又拥有会员十万人的产联运输工人工会执行局于九月五日会议中，会以十九对五票通过决议，痛斥民主、共和两党的总统候选人，谴责该工会主席奎尔未与执行局协商即擅自宣布支持杜鲁门之行动。"

    "content": "“The People’s Hospital”\n　　Yangcheng People’s Hospital Deeply Supported by the Masses\n    [Taiyue Telegraph] The Yangcheng People's Hospital enthusiastically serves the people and is praised by the masses as \"our people's hospital.\" The hospital was established in the spring of 1947 and has gradually developed through hard work. In the past year, the funds have grown from 4 million to over 40 million. Fifteen new wards and twelve cave dwellings have been built. The number of doctors, health workers, purchasers, and salespersons has increased from eighteen or nineteen to forty-one (including five practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine and four Western doctors). A branch hospital has also been developed. The reason for this is primarily that they have the correct policy: uniting doctors of Chinese and Western medicine to treat the masses. Many people from various places come to see the doctors, not only from villages in Yangcheng County, but also from counties such as Jincheng and Yuanqu. According to statistics from May, June, July, and August, the internal medicine outpatient department saw 4,503 people, and the surgical department saw 1,293 people. There were 1,431 internal and surgical house calls. A total of 168 patients were hospitalized for internal and surgical treatment. Because the wards are full, more than a dozen patients often stay in the town. Two doctors make house calls every day. They participated in the war twice with the laborers, treating 1,892 patients. They also organized a rotational treatment team to go to the countryside for treatment. They vaccinated 3,276 people against smallpox and gave 380 people preventive injections. In terms of style, the procedures for seeing a doctor are simple, making it convenient for the masses to seek medical treatment. They have designated times for outpatient and house calls, and see patients as soon as they arrive. When going out to treat patients, they go regardless of wind or rain, late at night or in the wee hours of the morning. They do not ride animals or take vehicles, and treat both government cadres and rural masses equally. For example, a child in Xuqing Village (five miles from the town) fell ill, and someone came to ask for a doctor in the middle of a rainy night. The doctor went in the rain and cured the child. Hospitalization is even more convenient: patients can cook their own meals if they wish, or eat at the hospital. Patients can bring their own caretakers to stay in the hospital. If they don't have caretakers, the hospital has nurses who are very attentive. For example, a woman from Jihe County named Lu Lanzi came to Yangcheng to visit relatives and fell ill in the shop, suffering from severe paratyphoid fever. The hospital admitted her to the ward and patiently cured her. To prevent the masses with financial difficulties from delaying treatment, the doctors stipulated that patients could pay on credit and repay later. If they cannot pay in full at once, they can pay in two or three installments. The doctors are enthusiastic and responsible towards their patients, and their attitude is kind. From morning to night, they treat patients as if they were their own family members. Patients say, \"The doctors are unpretentious and don't think we're dirty.\" Some say, \"It really is our people's hospital.\" In addition, after research by doctors of Chinese and Western medicine, the hospital has used traditional Chinese medicine to produce more than 30 kinds of medicines to replace Western medicines.\n    [Taiyue Telegraph] In order to eradicate the prevalent diseases in the countryside, the Fushan County government has specially organized doctors from the entire county to go to various districts and villages to treat the masses. According to statistics from the first and third districts, a total of 41 doctors were organized. From August 5th to 15th, the doctors visited eleven administrative villages in the first district and sixteen administrative villages in the third district, treating a total of 1,356 patients of all ages. Six hundred and thirty-nine people suffered from dysentery, and 629 were cured. One hundred and ninety-one adults suffered from plague, and 188 were cured. In addition, 90 people with cholera and 140 people with malaria were cured. Many farmers who used to seek treatment from gods and ghosts are now beginning to see doctors.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “老百姓的医院”　阳城人民医院深受群众拥护\n\n1948-09-18\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“老百姓的医院”\n  　阳城人民医院深受群众拥护\n    【太岳电】阳城人民医院热情为人民服务，被群众誉为“咱们老百姓的医院”。该医院于一九四七年春天成立后，艰苦经营，逐渐发展。一年来，基金由四百万发展到四千多万元。建筑起十五间新病房，十二孔窑洞。医生、卫生员、采购、营业员等由十八九人发展到四十一人（内有五个中医，四个西医）。并发展了一个分院。其原因，首先是他们有正确的方针：团结中西医生，为群众治病。各地群众来看病的很多，不只有阳城县各村群众，还有晋城、垣曲等县群众远道前来。据五、六、七、八四个月的统计，门诊内科四千五百零三人，外科一千二百九十三人。出诊内外科一千四百三十一人。住院治疗的内外科一百六十八人。因病房住满，城关还经常住十几个病人。每天有两个医生登门治疗。他们两次随民工参战，治疗病人一千八百九十二人。又组织有轮回治疗组，亲到农村去治疗。前后施种牛痘三千二百七十六人，打防疫针三百八十人。作风上，看病手续简单，使群众看病方便。他们设有门诊、出诊时间、随到随看。出门治病不管刮风下雨，半夜三更，多会来请就多会去。不骑牲口，不坐车，无论对机关干部和乡村群众，一律看待。如旭庆村（离城五里）有一个小孩病了，半夜下雨来请，医生就冒雨前去，给他治好。住院看病的更是方便：愿在医院起火也可以，自己做的吃也可以。病人可以带自己的侍候人住在院中。没带侍候人的。医院有护理员，招呼也很周到。如稷河县一个妇女名叫鲁兰子的来阳城探亲，病在店里，害副伤寒很重。医院把她收到病房，耐心治好。为使经济困难的群众不误治病，医生规定看了病可以记帐，以后再还。一次给不清，两次三次都可以。医生们对病人热心负责，态度和善。他们每天从早到晚把病人看的和自家人一样。病人们反映说：“医生们没架子，不嫌咱脏。”有的说：“真是咱老百姓的医院。”此外，该院经中西医生研究，用中药制出三十多种药剂代替西药。\n    【太岳电】浮山县政府为扑灭农村流行的疾病，特组织全县医生分工到各区村给群众看病。一、三区统计，共组织四十一名医生，在八月五日到十五日十天里，一区到了十一个行政村，三区到了十六个行政村，共看了男女老小病人一千三百五十六名。患痢疾的六百三十九名，治好六百二十九名。大人瘟症一百九十一名，治好一百八十八名。另外治好霍乱病九十人，疟疾一百四十名。许多农民过去求神鬼治病的，现在都开始请医生看病。"

The salaries of our shop assistants are determined arbitrarily by the manager at the end of each year. However, no one is allowed to withdraw their full salary for the year, and by the following year, due to rising prices, the saved wages lose their value. Last August, the store was confiscated by the government, but some of the shop assistants had received part of their wages for the previous eight months, while others had received nothing at all. Now that the government has returned Chunheqing Pharmacy, the shop assistants are demanding a settlement of the wages owed for the past eight months with the manager. Manager Wang proposed that last year's wages be calculated at 20,000 Jichaos per month, which would not even buy two dou of millet now. Considering that Chunheqing is an average private business, this response to the shop assistants' demands is considered unreasonable. The shop assistants have limited savings beyond clothing expenses and are experiencing difficulties. Everyone is requesting that this matter be written to the newspaper. Is such an excessive reduction of wages in accordance with industrial and commercial policies? Do shop assistants have any protection?\n  　　　　　　　　　Baixiang Chunheqing Pharmacy Shop Assistant Wang Qilin\n    Answer: In order to develop industry and commerce and implement the labor-capital mutual benefit industrial and commercial policy, we have opposed the leftist tendency of excessively raising wages. However, some businessmen, under the pretext of protecting and developing industry and commerce, excessively reduce the wages of shop assistants and apprentices. Like Manager Wang of Chunheqing mentioned in your letter, who has long suppressed the wages of shop assistants, profiting from the rising prices, and now wants to use the same method to settle the wages owed, is extremely unreasonable. This issue should be resolved reasonably according to the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, based on the general living conditions at that time and the economic situation of Chunheqing after its return. We hope that the Baixiang County Government and the trade union will assist both parties in resolving this matter reasonably and inform us of the handling situation. At the same time, it is necessary to check whether there are similar deviations in other factories and businesses.  　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 过分降底店员工资　不合乎工商政策\n\n1948-09-18\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　过分降底店员工资\n  　不合乎工商政策编辑同志：\n    我在柏乡城内春和庆药铺当店员，我们店员每年薪资都由经理到年底随便给，但是当年的工资谁也不让支光，到第二年因物价上涨所存工资就吃亏了。在去年八月间柜上被政府没收，可是以前八个月的工资有的店员支了一部分，有的分文未支，现在政府退还了春和庆药铺，店员们都要求与经理清算去年八个月的工资。王经理提出，去年工资每月按冀钞二万元计算，这样现在还买不到二斗小米。按春和庆在普通私营里也是个乙等商号，就这样答复店员的要求，店员都感到不合理，因店员们除去做衣服外剩余有限，都感觉困难，大家都要求把这事写给报社，象这样过分降低工资，是不是合乎工商政策？店员是否还有保障？\n  　　　　　　　　　柏乡春和庆药铺店员王岐林\n    答：为了发展工商业，执行劳资两利的工商政策，我们曾反对了过分提高工资的左倾偏向。但有些商人借口保护发展工商业，过分降低店员学徒的工资，象你所提春和庆王经理，过去长期积压店员工资，等物价上涨从中取利，现又想仍用前法来清偿所欠工资，是极为不合理的。这个问题，应根据劳资两利的原则，按当时当地一般生活条件，与春和庆退还后的经济情况，合理解决。希望柏乡县府及职工会协助双方合理解决，并将处理情况告诉我们，同时更应检查其他工厂商号中是否也有类似偏向。  　　——编者"

At the same time, in order to overcome the state of indiscipline and disorganization and to unify will and action, it is necessary to be good at using the Party newspaper, a propaganda weapon with wide circulation, rapid dissemination, and enormous influence. Neglecting the role of the Party newspaper and failing to use it effectively to guide work makes it impossible for the Party's correct guidance to produce rapid and widespread effects among the broad masses of cadres and people. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must regard the communication work of organizing稿件for the Northeast Daily as one of the regular duties of each Party committee and also as an obligation that every Party member with writing ability should have. We must resolutely criticize and correct the erroneous thinking that regards Party newspaper communication work as an \"extra burden\" and believes that it is \"optional,\" which violates the policy of the whole Party running the newspaper.\n\nThe notice stipulates: (1) The Party newspaper committees of each province should also be the reporting committees of the province, and should be responsible for guiding and organizing the communication work of each province for the Northeast Daily, and ensuring that each province and county can write at least one article for the Northeast Daily each month. The content should be a comprehensive overview of the work of the province, city, and county, or an analytical discussion of a certain issue. The municipal and county Party committees should appoint the Minister of Propaganda or the Secretary to serve as a special correspondent for the Northeast Daily, leading the communication work in their respective regions. (2) Each department and commission of the Northeast Bureau and each larger unit directly under the system should designate a full-time person in the propaganda department of the unit to concurrently serve as a communication officer for the Northeast Daily. Factories, mines, etc. should be responsible by trade unions at all levels to form communication groups or designate one or two correspondents. (3) Each local military region should designate the Minister of Propaganda of the Political Department to be responsible for the communication leadership work of its subordinate troops. (4) The editorial department of the Northeast Daily should, from now on, submit the contribution results of each unit to the Northeast Bureau and the responsible organs every three months to assess the communication work of each unit.\n\nThe notice also stipulates: In order to correctly reflect the work situation and strengthen the guiding role of the Party newspaper: (1) All news communications must be completely true and in line with the actual situation. Reports should be conducted analytically and critically in accordance with the Party's policies. For稿件 reporting on the work of various regions, troops, and departments that have important principles, the负责人of the relevant organizations must personally review them, and if there are different opinions, the original稿件and different opinions should be sent to the newspaper for careful handling and should not be withheld. (2) Criticism and self-criticism should be promoted, and the bad practice of only reporting achievements and not reporting shortcomings, or reporting more achievements and fewer shortcomings, should be opposed. (3) Communication work should pay close attention to the opinions and voices of the masses, and should investigate the implementation of policies among the masses and listen to the criticisms of the masses.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 适应新形势下的工作规模　必须善于利用党报  东北局指示开展通讯工作\n\n1948-09-18\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　适应新形势下的工作规模\n  　必须善于利用党报\n    东北局指示开展通讯工作\n    【新华社东北十五日电】中共中央东北局为适应目前东北新的形势和工作情况，进一步改进与开展东北局机关报东北日报的通讯工作，特于“九一”发出“中共中央东北局关于开展东北日报通讯工作的通知”，指示各级党委必须于九月份内认真检查一次对东北日报的通讯工作，在全党内进行加强党报观念的教育，贯彻全党办报的方针，并限令各省、各部门对该通知中所规定各项之执行情形，于九月底前汇报东北局。\n    通知指出：目前东北党领导着复杂而多方面的工作，分散的手工业式的工作方法和领导方法已不能适应今天的工作规模；同时为克服无纪律无组织的状态，统一意志和行动，就必须善于利用党报这个发行广泛、传播迅速、影响巨大的宣传武器。忽视党报的作用，不善于利用党报去指导工作，党的正确指导就不可能在广大干部和群众中产生迅速的普遍的效果。因此，各级党委必须把为东北日报组织稿件的通讯工作，看成是每个党委的经常业务之一，也是每个有写作能力的党员应有的义务；坚决批评与纠正那些把党报通讯工作看成“额外负担”，认为“可作可不作”的违背全党办报方针的错误思想。\n    通知规定：（一）各省党报委员会，同时也应是该省的报导委员会，应负责指导和组织各省关于东北日报的通讯工作，并保证每个省、县都能按月给东北日报至少写一篇稿件，内容应该是省、市、县工作的综合概述，或关于某一问题的分析论述。各市委、县委，应指定宣传部长或书记担任东北日报特约通讯员，领导其所属地区之通讯工作。（二）东北局各部委，直属系统各较大单位均应由该单位的宣传部门指定专人，兼作东北日报通讯干事。各工厂、矿山等由各级工会负责，成立通讯小组，或指定一、二个通讯员。（三）各地方军区，应指定政治部宣传部长担任其所属部队之通讯领导工作。（四）东北日报编辑部应于今后每三个月内，将各单位投稿成绩，汇交东北局及各负责机关，以考核各单位的通讯工作。\n    通知又规定：为正确地反映工作情况，加强党报指导作用：（一）各项新闻通讯，必须完全真实，合乎实际情况。按照党的政策有分析有批判地进行报导。凡报导各地区各部队各部门工作情况的有重要原则性的稿件，各有关组织的负责人必须亲自审阅，如有不同意见，应将原稿和不同意见一并寄交报社慎重处理，不得扣压。（二）提倡批评与自我批评，反对只报成绩，不报缺点或多报成绩少报缺点的恶劣作风。（三）通讯工作应密切注意群众的意见和呼声，并要在群众中考查政策执行的情况，和听取群众的批评。"

Now, as the final collection of past arrears is being carried out, the district cadres asked them to hand it over, but they all said that they could not collect any more. Later, the district cadres slowly investigated and found out that the village had secretly withheld more than two thousand catties of public grain. During the cadre meeting in the evening, they confessed the truth. This practice of deceiving the higher authorities and affecting the entire front-line support work for the convenience of one village's people is very wrong.

Tax rate unification means that all localities must resolutely implement the stipulated tax rates and must not change them without authorization. System unification means that tax reports must be submitted on time, and all tax revenue goes into the financial income, and no locality may use it privately.\n\n    Second, tax collection should be based on the standard of benefiting the restoration and development of industry and commerce and promoting economic prosperity. All non-prohibited goods are allowed to be imported and exported, and exports of local products and imports of necessities should be exempted or lightly taxed; goods in transit should also be lightly taxed.\n\n    In addition, the circular also stipulates a number of specific issues related to actively organizing reasonable tax collection.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 便利贸易发展经济　豫西确定税收方针\n\n1948-09-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　便利贸易发展经济\n  　豫西确定税收方针\n    【新华社中原十三日电】中原解放区豫西行署为便利商民贸易、尽速恢复与发展工商业、繁荣经济，顷通令所属，阐述今后税收方针为：\n    首先是统一征收，做到地区、税率、制度三大统一。地区统一是对外以豫西为出入境的整体，由各专署统一筹划，所有税收机关全部统一于政府或移交政府；对内贯彻执行贸易自由；对友邻解放区过境货物应贯彻税不重征的原则。税率统一是各地必须坚决执行规定之税率，不得私自更改。制度统一则是税收表报必须按期送上，一切税款归财政收入，各地不得私自动用。\n    其次是税收以有利于恢复与发展工商业、繁荣经济为标准，凡非违禁品即允许入口出口，土产的出口与必需品的入口，应予免税或轻税；对过境货物亦须轻税。\n    此外，该通令中还对有关积极组织合理税收的若干具体问题作出规定。"

More than half of it has been excavated, and some has collapsed due to rain, making it very dangerous for large carts to pass, and cars dare not use it at all. Another section, over one meter wide, has been dug up not far south of this pit. Nearby villagers still frequently dig there, greatly hindering both public and private transportation. The Jingxing Coal Mine Company has repeatedly suggested to the Hengjian District Office (Fourth District) that they stop this behavior and repair the road to facilitate vehicle passage, but the District Office has ignored these requests.

The most obvious example is the Xinhua Bookstore, which occupies seventeen rooms of Ruijihao's city housing and has never paid a penny in rent. Moreover, when they initially moved in, it was not genuinely with the homeowner's true consent, but they moved in anyway. This was personally told to me by the owner of Ruijihao. As a result, he has no intention of repairing the house that was damaged by rain this year. According to the New Democracy economic policy, rental relationships are allowed to exist under certain conditions, especially city housing rentals, which are not feudal in nature. If this continues, it will be harmful to the development of industry and commerce and social construction, and it violates the Party's policy.\n\n　　(2) Gambling is rampant in Zhongjiabi Village, Pingshan, with frequent money games. Cadres are helpless in the face of it. Gambling is something done by hooligans and idlers, which not only hinders production and disrupts social order but also corrodes the masses' thinking and should be corrected immediately.\n\n　　　　Niu Dengkui\n\n　　The above two suggestions, hope relevant departments will investigate and resolve them.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 占用市房应出赁钱\n牛登逵\n1948-09-19\n第1版()\n专栏：批评与建议\n\n　　占用市房应出赁钱编辑同志：\n    （一）九月五号上午，听平山城内西街登记房屋的同志谈，该城私人的市房被公家占居经商者，都不出赁钱。最显明的例子如新华书店，占领瑞记号的市房十七间，始终未给分毫赁钱。同时，在初居时，并非真得房主真心自愿，就搬进去了。这是该号亲自向我谈的。所以在今年被雨淋垮的房屋他至今无心修理。按新民主主义经济政策，是允许租赁关系在一定条件下存在的，尤其是市房的租赁，并非封建剥削性质，如果这样下去，对工商业的发展与社会建设是有害无益的，是违反党的政策的。\n    （二）平山中贾壁村赌博风行，经常玩钱，干部见了束手无策。赌博是流氓懒汉所办的事，不仅妨碍生产，扰乱社会秩序，而且会腐蚀群众的思想，应即纠正。\n    　牛登逵\n    以上两个建议，希有关方面加以检查解决。"

    "content": "[Taihang Telegram] The intense struggle to protect the autumn harvest has begun in northern Henan. Hui County and Ye County started their autumn harvest in late August. Local armed forces have also proactively extended their activities to the front-line areas and have promoted the experience of \"holding a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other\" from the wheat protection campaign to help the masses with the harvest. A unit of the Hui County Brigade, with extremely high morale after the democratic movement, advanced to the area around the city to strike the enemy and carry out political offensives, covering the masses' harvest. This unit operated as close as one li from the city, near the west and south gates, and slogans were written all over the villages. During operations in the Liulin area, they specifically set aside time during their afternoon nap to wholeheartedly help the masses with the harvest, which was warmly supported by the local people. The city gate and Ninth District militia rotation teams of the county have achieved continuous victories in the autumn harvest protection campaign. On the night of August 23rd, more than 100 enemies from the city surrounded Liudian Village to seize grain. The Zhuoshui joint defense militia discovered them and opened fire. The Liulin joint defense ×× militia, working team, and the Second Battalion of the battalion soldiers rushed to support them. The Zhuqiao militia self-defense team also ambushed the enemy along the road. In this joint defense operation, two enemies were wounded. On the same night, more than 100 enemies from Xiuwu came out to seize recruits and livestock, but were defeated by our Ninth District militia rotation team at Wuliyuan, capturing two enemies, seizing two rifles, and 50 rounds of ammunition. On the night of the 24th, the enemy went to Changwu and set up camp, seizing five head of livestock and taking away six people from the masses. The militia rotation team heard about this and rushed to attack. The enemy fled in panic, and all the livestock were intercepted, and five people from the masses were freed. In addition to issuing a circular of commendation, the county headquarters specifically awarded the combat militia 200 rounds of ammunition, 50 hand grenades, and 20 artillery shells. The Ninth District militia rotation team was awarded 400 rounds of ammunition and 20 small artillery shells. When a unit of the Ye County Brigade was operating in Wang'an Village, they also took time to help two households harvest more than ten mu of sorghum.\n\n[Taihang Telegram] In order to proactively welcome the autumn harvest protection struggle, the Yingbing unit of Xiuwu, northern Henan, after a sixty-li forced march on August 31st, crossed a thirty-li desert area, and unexpectedly attacked the enemy's forward stronghold of Huanfeng (more than ten li southeast of Xiuwu city). After a forty-minute battle, the defending enemy, the puppet township armed forces, were completely annihilated, except for more than 20 people who escaped over the walls.

Our military and civilians in the border areas have launched a struggle to protect autumn harvests and grain. On August 27th, bandit troops from Wang Qingtuo in western Tianjin grabbed many carts and seized whichever ripe crops they found in the fields. The six pseudo-major townships of Xin'an, Tang'erli (both belonging to Baxian County), Dongduan, Cecheng, Donggugang, and Deshengkou (all belonging to Jinwu County) have recently formed the \"Six Great Joint Townships\" in order to sabotage our region's autumn harvest and plunder grain. The Dongduan pseudo-major township even forced each village to establish a \"Field Protection Association.\" If a family's crops ripened, they had to first obtain a \"Harvest Permit\" from the \"Field Protection Association\" before being allowed to harvest. At the beginning of the harvest, they also had to hand over eight catties of \"green grain\" per mu. The Taohe (belonging to Jinwu County) pseudo-major township forced each household to hand over twelve catties of \"green grain\" in advance. In addition, they demanded large quantities of grain from various villages. The Dongduan pseudo-major township demanded more than 12,000 catties from its own village in one instance. The Wuqing pseudo-county government extorted \"compensation grain\" from the villages (because the bandits lost the county town and grain in July, they made the masses compensate), at thirteen catties per mu. Chiang bandits in various places also arrested people and seized livestock on a large scale, forcing the masses to compensate with grain. In Zhangfang Village (Jinwu County), with just over twenty households, eight people were arrested and eight mules were seized. Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Anci County also constantly arrested people and seized grain in villages in the fifth and sixth districts of the county. On September 2nd and 3rd, two regiments of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Baoding went to Da Hou Village and Xiao Hou Village in Anxin County to grab crops and disrupt the people's autumn harvest. In order to smash the Chiang bandits' conspiracy to grab autumn crops and grain, border villages in Jinwu, Qingyuan and other places are actively organizing armed forces, implementing the integration of labor and military affairs, and defending the autumn harvest. Local armed forces, militia, and work teams are also actively conducting grain protection and autumn harvest protection struggles. In August, according to incomplete statistics, our local armed forces, militia, and work teams north of the Daqing River fought a total of sixty-seven battles, annihilating more than 320 enemies, seizing five machine guns, 138 rifles and pistols, more than 3,300 rounds of ammunition, and other items.

In Linshu (new county, formerly eastern Linyi), after ten days of concentrated effort, 400,000 mu of autumn crops have been completely harvested. In the Lingquan District of Junan (new county, formerly southern Ju County), as of August 26th, over 40,000 mu of wheat fields out of the district's total of 60,000 mu have been cultivated. In the Zhaixi District of Yidong (new county, eastern Yishui), mutual-aid teams of men and women are organized, and the autumn harvest is generally completed ahead of schedule. In Puwang Village of this district, 97 young and middle-aged women and some children cut the ears, bundled sorghum stalks, and pulled cowpea seedlings while the adult men and women were cutting sorghum. This enabled the village's six-day harvesting plan to be basically completed in four days, and the 26 head of cattle in the mutual-aid group then went to the slopes to plow the land. In areas lacking draft animals, under the slogan of \"early cultivation, early planting, early eating,\" autumn cultivation is carried out by people pulling plows while harvesting. The frontier area of Linshu has completed the rush harvest under the combination of labor and armed forces. Before the autumn harvest and autumn cultivation, farmers have been adding livestock and farm implements, and also composting and accumulating fertilizer. The Fuli District of Linshan (new county, formerly northeastern Fei County) purchased more than 200 head of cattle for plowing, and the Lidong District of Pingyi (new county, formerly southern Fei County) added 102 head of cattle and donkeys in July. The Henan District of Yidong added 274 pieces of farm implements such as wheelbarrows and plows. Qushu Village in Junan composted one-third to one-half more fertilizer than in previous years.

Thousands of mu of rice paddies east of Xingtai City have been infested with old rice stem borers. Due to the lack of timely eradication, they have suffered serious losses. In Wu'an County of the Sixth Special District, and Lin County, Ye County, Zhangnan, Anyang, and other counties of the Fifth Special District, cutworms, locusts, and scarabs have been found to be severely damaging mung beans and millet. With the autumn harvest approaching, the Taihang Administrative Office issued an emergency instruction on August 30, requiring leaders at all levels to be seriously vigilant, immediately launch inspections, and overcome complacency. In areas where insect plagues have already occurred, regardless of their severity, once they are discovered, the masses must be organized to eradicate them with all their might. Complacency and inaction are not permitted, resulting in losses. It is also required that the occurrence, development, eradication process, and experiences of insect pests, as well as the degree of damage, affected area, types of pests, and their characteristics, be reported to the Administrative Office in a timely manner. On the same day, the Administrative Office issued a circular throughout the region, commending the Fifth Special District Agricultural and Forestry Team, the Lin County Cooperative Section, and the cadres of Dongtun Village for their active struggle against insect plagues.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 12th: Under the leadership of the democratic government, the people of Bohai, Lucent South and other places in Shandong Province have actively dredged rivers and built embankments, benefiting two million mu of farmland. The Bohai area has completed the dredging projects of seven rivers, including the Shibei River, the Fu River, the Tuhai River, the Xiaofu River, the Xuanhui River, the Qundai River, and the Mi River. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 132,000 laborers were used, and more than 4.477 million cubic meters of earth were excavated. The Shibei River originates in Nanpi, Hebei Province, passes through Cangxian and Huanghua (renamed from Xinhua), and enters the sea through Qikou. There are 72 depressions on both sides of the river, all of which rely on the river for drainage to avoid disasters. However, due to years of disrepair, several sections of the riverbed have been silted up. The Great Wave Depression and Caijia Kiln and other places have accumulated water for as long as 18 years. Most of the land in northern Huanghua was occupied by the river, and the local people could not cultivate the land, but only made a living by fishing, drying salt, cutting reeds, and selling grass. The Fu River originates from the Grand Canal south of Cangzhou City, passes through Cangxian and Jinan (newly established county, parts of Huanghua and Qingxian), and also enters the sea through Qikou. Due to disrepair of the river course, coupled with repeated destruction by the Kuomintang army, dangers have occurred frequently. The upper reaches of the river, including the Zhang and Wei rivers, have been dredged by the Hebei-Luyu Democratic Government, and the water flow has accelerated. If the Fu River downstream is not repaired, it will cause serious floods. Therefore, the democratic governments of Huanghua, Jinan, Jingyuan (formerly Yanshan), Nanpi, and Cangxian mobilized more than 64,000 laborers in April this year to start dredging, which was completed by the end of June, and a new river channel of more than 16 kilometers was newly excavated, and a new sluice gate was built at the junction of the two rivers. In this way, more than 5,000 mu of land in the above-mentioned 72 depressions were freed from water disasters, and the accumulated water along the river for 18 years was also dredged. The reed marsh of more than 800 square li in the suburbs of Huanghua can increase the production of reeds by one time. If water conservancy is further developed, 3,000 square li of land east of Xiasanpu in Jinan and west of Qikou can be irrigated by the Shibei River and turned into paddy fields; ships on both rivers can also navigate inland and sell fish and salt along the coast. The Tuhai River, which flows through Shanghe, Bin County, and Zhanhua, has been dredged for more than 200 kilometers. The Xiaofu River in Huantai, the Xuanhui River in Jingyuan, the Mi River in Shouguang, and the Qundai River in Boxing have all been dredged and embanked. After the Mi River and Qundai River were repaired and dredged, 230,000 mu of land benefited.\n    Weian (newly established county, northeast of Anqiu), Yishui North, Yishui South and other counties in Lucent South have dredged and opened the Honggou, which has been silted up for 70 years, and built the dam on the Mazhan River and opened canals, with a total length of 98 li, protecting a total of more than 300,000 mu of land, with a total of more than 226,000 laborers. The government provided a total of 5.5 million yuan in North Sea currency and 400,000 jin of grain for work accounts.\n    Gaomi County in Binbei repaired the Wulong River, using more than 115,000 laborers. Now the river is straight and the river is surging. After the river was repaired, 60,000 mu of good land was rescued, and 6 million jin of grain can be increased annually.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东人民积极治河修筑堤坝　受益田地达二百万亩\n\n1948-09-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东人民积极治河修筑堤坝\n  　受益田地达二百万亩\n    【新华社华东十二日电】渤海、鲁中南等地人民在民主政府领导下，积极疏浚河流，修筑堤坝，受益田地达二百万亩。渤海区先后完成石碑河、滏河、徒骇河、孝妇河、宣惠河、群带河、弥河等七条河流疏导工程。据不完全统计，共用民工十三万二千余人，挖土四百四十七万七千余方。石碑河发源于河北省之南皮，经沧县、黄骅（新海改名）由歧口入海。两岸有洼地七十二处，均靠该河排水，始能免灾，但因年久失修，河床数段淤平，大浪淀、蔡家窑等地竟有积水达十八年者。黄骅北部大半土地被该河水侵占，当地群众无法耕作，惟以捕鱼、晒盐、割苇、卖草为生。滏河发源于沧州城南之运河，经沧县、津南（新设县，黄骅、青县各一部），亦由歧口入海。河道失修，又加国民党军多次破坏，曾不断出险；而该河之运河上游及其支流漳、卫两河，均经冀鲁豫民主政府修浚，水流加急，下游之滏河不修，必将造成严重水灾。因此，黄骅、津南、靖远（原盐山）、南皮、沧县等六县民主政府于今年四月动员民工六万四千余人，开始疏浚，于六月底大功告成，并新挖河道十六余公里，在两河相接处新修水闸一座。这样就使上述七十二洼地五千余亩土地免除了水患，沿河十八年积水亦获疏浚。黄骅城郊八百余方里的苇洼可增产苇子一倍。如进一步建设水利，则津南下三铺以东、歧口以西三千方里土地可得石碑河之灌溉而变为稻田；两河船只亦可通航内地，畅销沿海鱼盐。流经商河、滨县、沾化等地的徒骇河疏浚了二百余公里。桓台孝妇河、靖远宣惠河、寿光弥河、博兴群带河等均进行了疏浚与筑堤。弥河及群带河修浚后，受益土地达二十三万亩。\n    鲁中潍安（新设县，安邱东北）、沂（水）北、沂（水）南等县，疏浚开凿已淤塞了七十年的洪沟，修筑了马站河上的大堤及开渠等共长九十八里，保护了总共三十余万亩的田地，计共用工二十二万六千多个。政府共贷北海币五百五十万元，发工帐粮四十万斤。\n    滨北高密县修治五龙河，用工十一万五千多个。现该河河身笔直，河水浩荡奔流。修河以后，救出良田六万亩，年可增产六百万斤粮食。"

They were peasants who were forcibly conscripted or captured by the Yan bandits last winter and this spring, and were liberated in successive battles such as Jiajiazhuang in Xiaoyi and Nanbeiqi in Wenshui. When they saw the democratic freedom and good life with food and clothing in the liberated areas, they recalled the painful situation in the Yan-occupied areas and the Yan bandit army. Coupled with their personal experience of our army's lenient policy, they were deeply moved and quickly awakened. In a team of 246 people, 58 people declared their withdrawal from the Yan bandit's \"Comrades Association\" and \"Iron Army Cadre\" and other special agent organizations. They turned the bitter water in their stomachs into a roar of anger to kill the enemy! Second-class soldier Liu Guoping recounted that after he was taken away by the 69th Division, there was nothing to eat at home. His mother and wife came to say that they could not survive at home, and they were driven away by the company, who said that they were sending information to the Eighth Route Army, and Liu Guoping was locked in the room and forced to confess. Liu fainted from fright. Speaking of this, his tears rolled down. Quartermaster Liu Shuangcai said: \"Once the battalion adjutant asked me to steal vegetables from the villagers. When I said no, he slapped me twice. I swallowed my tears and deserted, but was caught and imprisoned again, and only given a thin soup of three liang of rice a day. This time, the Liberation Army saved my life.\" Second-class soldier Zhang Ziyi cried and said: \"At the time of the organization, the old people said that they could not survive at home. I was conscripted into the army in February. I didn't know how to drill, and the squad leader was going to beat me to death.\" He shouted angrily: \"I want to join the Liberation Army! Eliminate Yan Xishan!\" (Ma Ming)\n\n[Jinzhong News] The new liberated soldiers of Jinzhong who joined our army have successively accused Yan's bandits of their crimes and exposed the dark rule in Yan's army, and are determined to eradicate the scourge of Chiang and Yan bandits to avenge their hatred. At the grievance meeting of the third squad of the 201st Brigade, He Chengtong, a liberated soldier from Jinyuan, burst into tears as soon as he spoke. When he narrated that during Yan's bandit \"organization,\" he was forced to say that he was eighteen years old when he was only seventeen, and was conscripted into the army. Because he could not carry a stone weighing more than a hundred pounds during training, he was tied up by the platoon leader and detained for seven days. Because he said he was \"hungry\" because he was not full, he was identified as a \"disguised element\" and was brutally beaten. He said angrily: \"This suffering was given by Yan Xishan. I will attack Taiyuan, catch him, and cut him piece by piece.\" Jiao Guiwa, a liberated soldier from Wangjiazhuang, was forced to join the army, and was tied up and pushed into a burial pit, buried up to his waist, and ordered to \"be free.\" Because he was not full all day long, his family brought him six jin of fried noodles, which was stolen by the platoon leader by four jin. He had to ask the sergeant to eat, and he only ate four liang. He said: \"This suffering cannot be suffered in vain. Only by resolutely eliminating Yan Xishan can we avenge our hatred.\" Liberated soldier Liu Xuecheng said: \"At home, I suffered the landlords' anger, and when I was a soldier, I suffered the officials' anger. I was forced to become a soldier, and the only half mu of reed land in my family was also occupied by the landlord. When I got to the army, I couldn't get enough to eat all day long. I drilled during the day and pushed the mill at night. In the cold winter and twelfth lunar month, I marched in heavy snow without shoes, and no one cared if my feet were frostbitten. Today I was liberated, and I realized that all this suffering was given to me by the reactionaries. I have made up my mind that only by resolutely eradicating the scourge of Chiang and Yan can the poor people turn over.\" Han Zigui, a new liberated soldier from the sixth squad, said: \"After I was forced to be organized and pulled to Yan's bandit's new recruit brigade, they told me to be a 'little tiger' to harm people (Iron Army organization). The captain thought I didn't report things, called me a 'dead tiger' and slapped me again.\" Yang Hong had spent money twice when he was organized. After being forced to become a soldier for the third time, he was often in a state of terror in the atmosphere of checking the Eighth Route Army today and checking \"disguise\" tomorrow, and could not live. Recalling the scene when he was just liberated, he said: \"Because I was deceived by the enemy's propaganda for a while, I was a little scared when I was just liberated, but the comrades treated me like brothers, and since then my heart has changed. I want to attack Taiyuan, catch Yan Xishan, and settle accounts with the old dog.\" (Chen Keng)\n\nHaving Heard the Accusations of the People of Jinzhong, the Soldiers are Determined to Avenge and Catch Yan the Thief\n[Jinzhong News] After our certain unit of the First Corps of the North China Field Army entered the newly liberated area of Jinzhong, the local people constantly accused us of the suffering they had suffered under Yan the thief's evil government. On August 11, an elderly man named Li Tianban, who was 58 years old, said to the troops: \"I would like to say to the Communist Party and the Liberation Army what is in my heart. My family of seven were originally poor peasants. Yan Xishan's 'Integration of Soldiers and Peasants' took away all the land. The old and young in the family had no labor force, and they had to grow ten mu of land for the national soldiers, and produce seventeen shi of grain. They couldn't eat a full meal all year round. When the harvest came this summer, the pseudo-township chief and the 'special commissioner' personally supervised it. They wanted it after every harvest. They couldn't eat a full meal all year round. They couldn't make a living, so they sold the broken furniture in their home and bought seven jin of sesame cakes. The whole family ate four jin in three days, and the remaining three jin were also taken away by the pseudo-township chief. The whole family cried bitterly, watching the old and young starving and unable to move. In order to let the children escape alive, they found a 23-year-old husband for their ten-year-old daughter. Even in this situation, they constantly called us to serve. Because we couldn't eat enough and were hungry, we couldn't walk, and I was beaten to death several times. If it weren't for the life-saving benefactor, the Liberation Army, who came early, nine out of ten families in this place would have starved to death.\" The comrades were moved to tears after hearing this. After the × company went back, they launched a heated discussion in the squad. Soldier Liu Futian said: \"When I joined the army, I didn't want to leave home far away, so I deserted. I feel very sad after listening to the villagers' accusations. If our place hadn't been liberated by the Communist Party earlier, it would be like the people here. I am determined to study hard, improve my skills, kill more enemies, and capture Taiyuan as soon as possible.\" The comrades in the telephone platoon reviewed and said: \"Seeing the suffering of the people in Jinzhong, it was wrong to not save the people's strength in the past. In the future, we will try our best to carry it ourselves, so as not to increase the burden on the people.\" Ge Xiuhai said: \"I feel very sad after listening to the villagers' accusations. When I was at home, my father went to the field to get some firewood, and the landlord saw it and insisted that he had taken his wet firewood, saying that he had committed a crime, and fined him one shi and two dou of wheat, including the expenses of the person in charge. Since then, it has become a bottomless pit, and it is not enough every year, so he became poor. Only after the three investigations and studies did my class consciousness improve, and I realized that I was doing it for myself. But I still miss my home. Recalling that I used to miss my home often was wrong. I must practice high skills, strengthen political training, resolutely attack Taiyuan, capture Yan the old thief alive, and get rid of this old scourge to avenge the people of Jinzhong.\" (He Jia)\n\nA Good Example of Obeying Discipline: Company Commander Li Weishun\nComrade Li Weishun, the company commander of the Seventh Company of a certain regiment, usually loves his soldiers and is brave in battle. He has shown mastery of principles and good implementation of discipline in this Jinzhong Campaign, and has therefore made meritorious service.\n\nDuring the Wanghu battle, he checked a dozen prisoners. A prisoner platoon leader was very scared and took out thirteen silver dollars to give him: \"Comrade, do you want it? I don't want it!\" Not only did he not want it, but he explained: \"Don't be afraid, our People's Liberation Army has liberated you and you are one of us. We don't want anything of your own. We will register it for you, and the things will not disappear.\" The prisoner platoon leader happily pointed to their dozen people and said: \"Whoever has anything, take it out and let the chief see it, and it will not disappear after registration.\" One of them took out another seven silver dollars. After registration, they were all returned to the person. This influenced the communication soldier Wu Zhong. When he caught a prisoner, the prisoner gave him something, but he refused and explained: \"We don't want your own things. If you hand over your weapons, you are one of us.\" Gao Shiyi, the leader of the first machine gun squad, also refused the offer and things from the prisoner. He said to everyone: \"None of our comrades should covet the prisoners' things. This is our policy, and no one should violate it. We must strive to be a model company and see who obeys it well. Explaining to the prisoners plays a great role and is also one of the conditions for making meritorious service.\" In Yuci City, he immediately asked the cooks to weigh two bags of flour seized from the enemy's county government and reported them to the higher authorities as they were. At that time, some comrades said: \"Why not report less?\" He immediately explained: \"We are the party army of the Communist Party, and we must be practical and realistic, and we must not be hypocritical to the superiors and hold two minds with the party.\" When our army entered Yuci City, many villagers were very scared under the deceptive propaganda of Yan the bandit. He saw a villager trying to run and asked: \"Where are you from? What do you have on you?\" The villager said: \"I am a merchant in the city\" while taking out a watch and a roll of bandit currency from his pocket and giving it to him. Li Weishun said kindly: \"Villagers, don't be afraid. We are the People's Liberation Army, and we are fighting for the people. You don't know yet, we don't want anything from the people. Don't run, go back quickly, it's okay, our troops don't beat or scold, you will know in a few days.\" In Chewan Liujialei Village, when the troops had their meal, there was the villagers' garlic field next to it. Some comrades pulled the villagers' garlic to eat because they had no vegetables. When he saw it, he explained to everyone: \"We have violated the discipline of the masses. This is the people's thing. Of course, we have difficulties, but this is temporary. What kind of impact will this have on the newly liberated villagers?\" Everyone listened and stopped eating.\n\n(Zhang Kerang, Qi Xuebin)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 把苦水变成了杀敌的怒吼！　晋中解放战士四一二名  自动报名参加解放军\n\n1948-09-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　把苦水变成了杀敌的怒吼！\n  　晋中解放战士四一二名\n    自动报名参加解放军\n    【晋中电】晋中前线某部首批解放之阎军四一二名报名参加解放军。他们是去冬今春被阎匪强编或抓去的农民，先后于孝义贾家庄、文水南北齐等历次战斗中解放过来的。他们一见到解放区民主自由、有吃有穿的好生活，就回忆起在阎占区及阎匪军中的痛苦情形来。加上对我军宽大政策的亲身体验，使他们深受感动，很快觉醒过来。在二四六人的一个队上，就有五十八人声明脱离阎匪“同志会”“铁军基干”等特务组织。他们把肚里的苦水变成了杀敌的怒吼！二等兵刘国平诉说他被六十九师抓走后家里没吃的，母亲老婆找来说了一句家里不能活，就被连里赶走，说她们是给八路军送情报，把刘国平关在房内，硬叫他自白。刘被吓的昏过去。说到这里，他的眼泪滚滚而下。勤务兵刘双财说：“有一次营部副官叫我去偷老乡的菜，我说不去，一连打了我两个耳光，我把泪咽在肚里，开了小差，又被抓回来坐了监，一天只给三两米的稀汤。这回才叫解放军救下我的命。”二等兵张子义哭着说：“编组时，老人就说家里没法活了。二月里抓我当了兵，我不会操法，班长就要往死里打我。”他愤怒的高呼：“我要参加解放军！消灭阎锡山！”（马明）\n    【晋中讯】参加我军之晋中新解放战士，纷纷控诉阎匪罪行与揭露阎匪军中的黑暗统治，并下定决心拔除蒋阎匪祸根报仇雪恨。在二○一大队三小队的诉苦会上，晋源解放战士贺成统刚一发言，即不由的痛哭起来。当他叙述到阎匪“编组”时，把他逼打着硬将十七岁说成十八岁抓了兵，因练兵背不动百多斤的大石头，被排长捆起押了七天，因吃不饱饭说了句“肚饿”而被指为“伪装分子”，惨遭毒打，他愤怒的说：“这苦都是阎锡山给的，打进太原捉住他，非一刀刀剐了他不行。”王家庄解放战士焦桂娃被迫当兵后，又被捆着推到埋人坑里埋着半截身子，勒令“自由”，因整天吃不饱，家里给捎来六斤炒面，就被排长偷去了四斤，到班上还得请上等兵吃，轮到自己仅吃了四两。他说：“这苦不能白受，只有坚决把阎锡山消灭才算报了仇。”解放战士刘学成说：“在家受老财的气，当兵受做官的气，我被迫当了兵，家里仅有的半亩苇地也被地主霸占去。到部队上是成天吃不饱，白天下操，夜晚推磨，十冬腊月下大雪行军没鞋，脚冻烂了也没人理。今天我得到了解放，才懂得这些苦都是反动派给我的。我已下定决心，只有坚决拔掉蒋阎祸根，穷人才能翻身。”六小队新解放战士韩自贵说：“我被迫编组拉到阎匪新兵大队后，叫我当‘小老虎’害人（铁军组织），队长嫌我不报告事情，把我叫去骂我是‘死老虎’，又打了我一顿耳光。”杨洪被编组时曾花了两次钱，到第三次被迫当兵后，却经常在今天查八路，明天查“伪装”的恐怖空气中闹得提心吊胆，没法生活。他回忆到刚解放过来的情景时说：“因为我一时受了敌人的欺骗宣传，所以刚解放过来时心里有些害怕，可是同志们待我却象弟兄一样，从此我的心就变了。要打进太原捉住阎锡山，非和老狗日算帐不行。”（陈铿）\n    　　　　听了晋中人民的控诉　战士决心报仇捉阎贼\n    【晋中讯】我们华北野战第一兵团某部，进入晋中新解放区后，驻地人民不断向我们控诉阎贼恶政下所受的痛苦。八月十一日，又有一位五十八岁的老年人李天半向部队说：“我愿向共产党、解放军道说道说我的心里话。我家七口人，原是贫农，阎锡山‘兵农合一’把地都给合走了，家里老的老小的小没有劳力，还得给国民兵代种十亩地，出十七石粮，养种一年吃不上一顿饱饭。今夏打场时，伪乡长和‘特派员’亲身监督，打一场要一场，养种一年吃不上一顿饱饭。无法生活，就把家里破烂家具卖了，买回七斤油饼，全家三天吃了四斤，剩下三斤也被伪乡长拿走了。全家痛哭一场，眼看老少饿的走不动了。为叫孩子们逃个活命，把十岁的女儿找了个二十三岁的丈夫。就这光景还不断的叫俺支差。因吃不上饭，饿的心慌，走不动，把我几次打的死去活来。要不是救命恩人解放军早来了，这地方十家就得饿死九家。”同志们听了，感动的滴下泪来。×连回去后，在班里展开热烈的讨论。战士刘富田说：“我参军时不愿离家远了，曾开过小差。听了老乡诉苦，我心里很难过。我们那里要不是共产党早解放了，得象这里人民一样。我下定决心，保证好好学习，提高技术，多杀些敌人，早打下太原。”电话排的同志们检讨说：“看到晋中人民这样痛苦，过去行军不节省民力是错误的。今后尽量自己扛，做到不加重人民负担。”葛修海说：“听了老乡诉苦，很难受，在家时我父亲去地里弄了点烧柴，被地主看见，硬说是弄了他的湿柴，说是犯了法，连罚带办事人花费了一石二斗麦子。从此成了无底窟窿，一年还不够一年，便弄穷了。经三查学习才提高了我的阶级觉悟，才晓得是为自己干。可是还想家，回想我过去常想家是不对的，我一定要练高技术，加强政治锻炼，坚决打进太原去，活捉阎老贼，刨掉这老祸根，为晋中人民复仇。”（何家）\n    　　　　遵守纪律的好榜样　李维顺连长\n    某团七连连长李维顺同志，平时爱兵，打仗勇敢，这次晋中战役中更表现了掌握原则，执行纪律好，因此立了功。\n    在王胡战斗时，他检查十几个俘虏，一个俘虏排长很害怕，拿出十三块白洋来给他：“同志你要吧，我不要了！”他不但不要，而且解释说：“你们不要害怕，咱们人民解放军解放了你们就是一家人，你自己的东西我们谁都不要，给你登记起来，东西没不了。”俘虏排长高兴的指着他们十几个人说：“谁有什么，拿出来叫首长看看，登记起来没不了。”里边有一个又拿出了七块白洋，登记后全还给了本人。这样影响了通信员武忠，他捉住俘虏，俘虏给他表他拒绝后解释说：“我们不要你自己的东西，交了武器就是一家人了。”一机枪班长高十一，俘虏给他表和东西，也同样拒绝了。他给大家说：“我们同志谁也不要眼热俘虏的东西，这是咱们的政策，谁都不要违犯，咱们要争取当模范连，看谁遵守的好。给俘虏作解释起的作用大，也同样是立功条件之一。”在榆次城，从敌人县政府缴下两袋面，他马上叫炊事员秤了，如数报了上级，当时有的同志说：“不如少报点。”他马上解释说：“咱们是共产党的党军，要实事求是，不能对上级虚伪，和党抱两条心。”我军进了榆次城，不少老乡在阎匪欺骗宣传下很害怕。他看见了一个老乡想跑，就问：“你是哪里的，身上有什么东西。”那个老乡一边说：“我是城里做买卖的。”一边从口袋里掏出一只表和一卷匪币给他，李维顺很和善的说：“老乡，你可不要害怕，咱们是人民解放军，是为老百姓打仗的，你今天还不知道，我们一点东西也不要老百姓的，你不要跑了，快回去吧，没事，咱的部队又不打骂，你等几天就知道了。”在车湾刘家垒村时，部队开了饭，旁边就是老乡的蒜地，有的同志因没菜，拔老乡的蒜吃，他看见就给大家解释：“咱们这是犯了群众纪律，这是老百姓的东西，咱们困难是当然的，但这是暂时的，如这样给新解放区老百姓个什么影响呢？”大家听了就都不吃了。\n    （张克让、齐学斌）"

    "title": "Unfair Distribution of Labor Assignments and Overly Fragmented Resources: A Large Number of Livestock in Yangqu Fall Ill",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-19",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "[Jinzhong Electric] The phenomenon of \"weak donkeys\" in Yangqu is very serious, greatly impacting production and support for the front lines. In the First District, there were a total of 311 donkeys. Before supporting the front, 97 were already weak and 16 had died from illness. After sending 100 to support the front, another 42 became weak and 4 died from illness after returning home. Of the 380 donkeys sent out by the entire county in the first phase of support, 200 were lost due to illness, weakness, and other reasons. The reasons for the weak donkeys are: (1) The harvest was poor last year, and there was a shortage of fodder during this year's spring plowing. The alfalfa planted was mainly used for human consumption, neglecting the livestock. Since the start of summer, the drought has prevented grass from growing, resulting in many becoming ill and weak even before supporting the front. (2) Historically, loans and the distribution of livestock during last year's land reform were too dispersed, with almost everyone without livestock receiving a share. Some families received one head of livestock for every six households, and some even received one for every nine households. In many cases, ownership was not fixed during distribution, and the masses feared that well-fed animals would be taken away. Some received only \"half a leg\" [a small share], making it unusable in times of urgency, and even then they had to support the front, which was not worthwhile. (3) The burden of military service is unfair: those who raise livestock support the front, those who don't don't support the front; those who raise good livestock support the front more, those who raise poor livestock don't support the front. The military service accounts are not carefully settled, leading to unequal suffering and happiness. Consequently, people are unwilling to raise livestock, let alone raise good livestock. Some individual households even nailed nails into the hooves of their donkeys to avoid supporting the front. Zhao Huangfa from Liujialin in the Fifth District was unwilling to support the front and deliberately lamed his donkey. Chou Hou'er from Dananping in the Third District sold five jin of millet when his livestock became weak during support and returned with the saddle on his back. Some embezzled fodder during support to buy straw hats and tobacco, neglecting to feed the livestock. Others didn't want to go to support the front themselves, relying on others to bring them along or hiring people to drive them, etc. All of these can lead to livestock being poorly fed and becoming weak. After analyzing these reasons, the county has recently formulated measures to overcome the \"weak donkey\" problem: (1) Resolutely implement the military service burden regulations. In the past, county and district leaders believed that military service was not much and did not pay attention to implementing the military service burden policy. Most village cadres did not understand the calculation methods or settle accounts. It has now been decided to immediately print and distribute the military service calculation methods to the village level, with county and district cadres seriously leading the inspection, extensively reviewing the past advantages and disadvantages among the masses, and determining that in the future, people and livestock will be uniformly calculated as labor. Those who support more will earn wages according to the number of labor days they contributed, and those who support less or do not support will subsidize rice. Expose and overcome the selfishness of individual cadres and their unwillingness to implement the military service regulations, and establish a settlement system. The county will uniformly issue labor tickets or military service payment certificates. (2) Properly handle and determine the ownership of livestock. For the donkey shares of real loafers, the masses can withdraw them at a price, paying the price in installments or offsetting it with cultivated land. For the rest, if the donkeys are not well fed, and they are willing to be consolidated by one family or two or three families, they can be dealt with according to the correct opinions of the masses by pricing and returning labor. Clearly announce: No matter whether the livestock is loaned, from fruits, or from relief, whoever receives it owns it and must not be randomly withdrawn or moved. (3) After the cultivation is completed, mobilize the livestock-raising households to organize themselves to graze on the back mountains. (4) Commend and reward those who feed livestock well, criticize those who feed them poorly, and those who deliberately damage livestock and sabotage support for the front lines, and combine this with educating the masses to improve their understanding of the revolutionary struggle and their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines. (5) Overcome the bureaucratic leadership style of the front-line transportation teams, commend the leadership style of those who love livestock, go deep among the masses, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 支差不公平分配太零散　阳曲牲口大批病倒\n\n1948-09-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　支差不公平分配太零散\n  　阳曲牲口大批病倒\n    【晋中电】阳曲“乏驴”现象十分严重，对生产支前影响很大。一区共毛驴三一一头，支前以前即乏下九七头，病死十六头；支前去了一百头，又乏下四二头，回家后病死四头。全县第一期出去支前的三八○头，因病、乏等原因减少了二百头。乏驴原因：（一）去年收成不好，今年春耕时草料缺，种的苜蓿只顾人吃，顾不得喂牲口。入夏以来，天旱草不长，在支前以前就病乏很多。（二）历年贷款及去年土改分配牲口太分散，凡没牲口的都有份。有六户分一头的，还有九户分一头的。分配时有很多没固定所有权，群众怕喂好拉走，有的分下了半条腿，紧时用不上，支前还得跟着，不合算。（三）军勤负担不公，养牲口支前，不养牲口不支前，养好牲口多支前，养坏牲口不支前。不认真结算军勤帐，苦乐不均，因之大家不愿意养牲口，更不愿养好牲口。有个别户竟把驴蹄子上钉上钉子，躲避支前。五区刘家林赵黄发不愿意支前，故意将驴打拐。三区大南坪臭猴儿，支前中牲口乏下，卖了五斤小米，背上鞍子回来了。有的在支前中把草料贪污了买草帽、旱烟，不喂牲口。还有人自己不愿去支前，靠别人捎着赶或雇人赶等等。这些都会使牲口喂坏乏下。分析了这些原因，县上最近订出克服“乏驴”的办法：（一）坚决执行军勤负担条例。过去县区领导思想上认为军勤不多，没有注意贯彻军勤负担政策。村干部多数不懂计算办法，也不结算。现在决定即刻印发军勤计算办法，发至村级，县区干部认真领导检查，在群众中广泛检讨过去利弊，确定今后人、牲口统一算工。多支者按多支工数赚工资，少支不支者贴米。揭发并克服个别干部之自私与不愿执行军勤条例的思想，建立结算制度。由县统一制发工票或军勤支付证。（二）妥善处理和确定牲口的所有权。对真正二流子的驴股，群众要抽可以作价抽股，分期付价，或耕地顶价。其余凡驴没喂好，愿意一家或三二家归并者，可根据群众正确意见作价还工归并处理。明确宣布：不论是贷款或果实或救济的牲口，给了谁就是谁的，不得乱抽乱动。（三）耕种完后，发动喂牲口户组织起来到后山放青。（四）表扬奖励喂好牲口的，批评喂坏的，故意将牲口闹坏，破坏支前的，并结合教育群众，提高他们对革命斗争的认识与支前的积极性。（五）克服支前运输队领导上的官僚主义，表扬爱护牲口，深入群众，发现问题，及时解决的领导作风。"

    "content": "Column: Inquiry and Reply\n\n　　Is the Policy \"Changing\" Too Fast? To the Editor:\n    I have found several issues that I would like to request be studied:\n    Since the correction work began in Changzhi City, it has caused confusion in the minds of many party members and cadres. Generally, they feel that the policy is changing too fast, and they want to do a good job, but they can't grasp the bottom line and don't know how to do it right. Some are unwilling to correct the deviation, thinking that we struggled against them in the past, and now we have to return things to them, which is too embarrassing. Or they think that the correction should be done, but it is difficult to do because it is embarrassing. Some more confused party members and cadres say that correcting deviations is like cutting chives; after correcting one deviation, another one comes along. The policy on industry and commerce is a dead policy applied flexibly. Some say that if we didn't struggle in the past, the higher-ups wouldn't allow it, and now if we don't correct it, it's not allowed either. The policy is changing all the time. They also say that it took us a lot of effort to stand up in the past, and we only managed to stand up halfway. Now we have to return things to them (referring to those who were wrongly struggled against), and they turned over in one night and raised their heads again. Some say that the rich are still rich anyway, and the poor are still poor. What kind of \"standing up\" is this after two years of struggle? As a result, some party members and cadres are ideologically confused and work is passive, which makes the leadership feel very difficult. What kind of ideological education should be adopted for these comrades to make them active in their work? Please publish this in the newspaper.\n  　　　　　　　　Gao Da, August 16th\n    Answer: To solve some ideological problems of party members and cadres in correcting deviations, the most important thing is to strengthen policy study. The confused thoughts reflected in the letter are all caused by a lack of understanding of the party's general line and general policy at the present stage, as well as the general line and general policy in the land reform. First of all, it is necessary to clarify whether the \"policy is changing too fast\" to the extent that the comrades below \"want to do a good job, but they can't grasp the bottom line\"? In Chairman Mao's speech at the meeting of cadres in Shanxi and Suiyuan, he explained that the party's general line and general policy today is: \"The revolution led by the proletariat, of the broad masses of the people, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.\" The general line and general policy in the land reform during this period of new democratic revolution is: \"Rely on the poor peasants, unite with the middle peasants, and eliminate the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinction, and develop agricultural production.\" This was not proposed today; it was clearly stated in On New Democracy a long time ago, and it has never changed. Why do comrades feel that the policy is changing quickly? This is because many of our comrades do not pay attention to study and forget the general line and general policy when implementing the policy, which leads to deviations. For example, in the land reform, if the elimination of feudalism is not thorough, and the poor and hired peasants are not relied upon, a right-leaning error is committed, which should be corrected. But if you infringe on the middle peasants and struggle against industry and commerce, forgetting that land reform is only to eliminate feudalism and forgetting that you should unite with the middle peasants, then you are leaning to the left, which must also be corrected. In this way, it seems that after correcting one deviation today, another one comes along tomorrow, correcting the left and then having the right, etc., as if the policy is constantly changing. In fact, the policy has not changed. It is that we have forgotten the general policy and general line in the implementation, sometimes leaning to the left and sometimes to the right. It is not that the policy is sometimes leaning to the left and sometimes to the right. The so-called correction of deviations is not simply a matter of correcting the left and correcting the right, but a struggle between the correct line and the wrong line. Understanding that correcting deviations is to correct mistakes and correctly implement the policy, some personal concerns, such as feeling embarrassed, will naturally be dispelled. The leading organs should also seriously and responsibly analyze and examine the causes of the errors and distinguish responsibilities, explaining that some problems were not clearly stated by the higher authorities and cannot be solely the responsibility of the lower levels. At the same time, based on the general line and general policy, analyze the nature of past errors and resolve the ideological knots of comrades. For example, some say: After struggling for half a year, we still have to return things; the rich are still rich, and what kind of \"standing up\" have the poor achieved? This is because they do not understand that land reform cannot eliminate poverty, because it does not eliminate all exploitation, but only eliminates feudal exploitation, freeing the rural productive forces from feudal exploitation. The purpose of land reform is to develop production. Therefore, the middle peasants should not be struggled against, because they are not feudal, they are producers, and they are still the main force in agricultural production in the old areas. To struggle against them is a mistake and should be corrected. Industry and commerce cannot be struggled against either, because they are not feudal exploitation, but an indispensable factor for developing production today. Naturally, correction and compensation should not be a matter of \"eating what you spit out,\" but should pay attention to not causing fluctuations, not discouraging the masses, and not affecting production, because the purpose of correcting deviations is still to develop production. The ideas of absolute egalitarianism among the masses must be educated and explained. For example, if someone says, \"After two years of struggle, what kind of 'standing up' have we achieved?\" it is necessary to analyze it according to the specific situation. If his land is indeed much less than the average amount of land in the whole village, it should be appropriately supplemented to roughly the average amount. If his land is already close to the average amount in the whole village, or if there is a shortage of land in the whole village and it cannot be supplemented, then he should be patiently explained to.

The article pointed out that since last winter, many instances of tree felling have occurred in various regions. Some farmers lack long-term planning, cutting down the trees they were allocated to sell or burn; some landlords and idlers are unwilling to work and secretly cut down trees for firewood. All regions should pay attention to and immediately stop these behaviors that are detrimental to production and long-term construction. The article believes that, apart from the large forests belonging to the government which should be under unified and strengthened management by the government, public trees belonging to the village should be managed by the village representative assembly, and a forest protection agreement can be discussed and decided by the villagers. For private trees, forest protection regulations can also be established to prohibit indiscriminate felling. Those who achieve results in forest protection and afforestation should be commended and rewarded. The article also pointed out that the Jin Sui border region is mountainous and has favorable conditions for afforestation; at the same time, due to uneven climate conditions of drought and flood, there is also an urgent need for afforestation and serious forest protection. This is a major event that benefits the masses and eliminates malpractices, and everyone should earnestly do this work well.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥日报号召切实保护树木\n\n1948-09-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥日报号召\n  　切实保护树木\n    【新华社晋绥十五日电】晋绥日报顷著论号召切实保护树木。该文指出自去冬以来，各地发生砍伐树木的事情很多。有的农民缺乏常远打算，把分到的树木，砍下卖了，或者烧了；有的地主和二流子不愿劳动，偷砍树木当柴烧。各地应重视并立即制止这些有害生产及长期建设的行为。该文认为，除属于政府的大山林应由政府统一加强管理外，属于村的公树即由村代表会管理，并可由村民议定护林公约。对于私人树木，亦可订出护林纪律，以禁滥伐。对于护林造林有成绩的，应给予表扬和奖励。该文并指出：晋绥边区多山，具备造林有利条件；同时，由于气候旱涝不匀，也迫切需要造林与认真护林。这是为群众兴利除弊的一件大事，大家应认真做好这个工作。"

    "content": "Shen County Production Promotion Cooperative\n　　Deeply Penetrates Rural Areas to Organize Production\n\n[Central Hebei News] The Shen County Production Promotion Cooperative was transformed from the county store this spring. During the transformation, a thorough business inspection was conducted, and the operation of goods that were not urgently needed for farmers' production was completely changed. The five branches were changed into seven sub-cooperatives, and the spirit of supporting farmers' production became clearer than before. However, the old methods and styles of business operation have not yet been transformed, and they are still waiting for customers at the counter, unable to penetrate the rural areas. On June 15th, a joint meeting of sub-cooperative directors was held, at which the slogans \"Transform methods\" and \"Business goes to the countryside\" were put forward. The specific practices of business work were clarified: (1) The task of each promotion sub-cooperative should be to deeply penetrate rural areas to organize production. The sub-cooperatives do not carry out procurement. The general cooperative uniformly procures according to the needs of the masses reflected by each sub-cooperative and distributes them to each sub-cooperative for promotion. (2) Except for one or two people (accountant plus trainee) to take care of the store, all other business personnel of each sub-cooperative should go to the countryside to work, and find business from the work in the countryside. (3) When business personnel of each sub-cooperative go to the countryside, on the one hand, they should help the masses with production, and on the other hand, they should carry out supply and marketing business. Organize the masses to invest the distributed floating wealth into production to prevent waste, and use this to develop the supply and marketing business of the Promotion Cooperative. From June 15th to the end of July, in one and a half months, in terms of organizing the investment of floating wealth into production, according to incomplete statistics from seven villages including Mu Village: 15 waterwheels were bought with floating wealth, more than 600 hoe blades, 3 livestock, and many other production tools such as chaff cutters and plows. In solving the problem of alfalfa (fodder) planting for the masses, the masses in the whole county need a total of 20 catties of alfalfa seeds. The county cooperative has bought 1,800 catties and distributed them to various sub-cooperatives to sell to the masses. It is estimated that 2,000 mu can be planted. The masses lacked cart bodies, so they provided loans to support the organization of two wooden goods factories, which produced 600 water buckets. In the past, the practice of supply and marketing business was from top to bottom, that is, goods were handled and distributed to various sub-cooperatives for promotion based on seasonal estimates. Therefore, the types and quantities of goods often did not meet the needs of the masses, making the goods unsalable. After the business went to the countryside, the combination of top-down estimation and bottom-up investigation gradually achieved complete conformity between supply and marketing business and the needs of the masses. The past counter-style operation tied the cadres to the market towns, and they could not often go to the countryside, so the tasks of organizing mass production and supporting the organization of mass cooperatives were difficult to achieve. After the business went to the countryside, more than 30 cadres were drawn from the whole cooperative to regularly help the masses plan and organize production, which laid a convenient foundation for organizing the work of mass cooperatives. In the past, supply and marketing business (must be in market towns) and agricultural loan work (must be in the countryside) were contradictory. Emphasizing supply and marketing business naturally relaxed agricultural loan work. Now that the supply and marketing business has gone to the countryside, it is naturally integrated under the general task of organizing farmers' production. At the same time, it will greatly reduce the cold goods in operation and speed up capital turnover.\n\nIn the process of implementing business going to the countryside, it will encounter various ideological and habitual obstacles. According to the experience of this period, to make \"business going to the countryside\" work well, the following points must be paid attention to: (1) Eliminate concerns and increase confidence. At the beginning, there were fears that less business would be done and no money would be made, and that \"it would not be able to sustain itself.\" Some business cadres who were accustomed to counter operations and had not done mass work were very tricky about business going to the countryside and did not know where to start. Therefore, the leadership must personally take action, provide specific help, and use concrete facts to dispel their concerns and increase confidence. (2) Prevent the viewpoint of bestowing favors and the tendency of laissez-faire. On the one hand, business going to the countryside is for the better support of mass production, and on the other hand, it is for the better development of business. The two are unified. However, some cadres only accepted the former aspect and did not earn the money they should earn when selling goods, which is not right. (3) It must be clear that the business cadres going to the countryside should simultaneously bear the three regular tasks of developing supply and marketing business, handling agricultural loans, and supporting mass cooperatives. These three are unified in the task of helping mass production and should not be neglected.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. TASS reports: 400,000 working people in Berlin held a powerful demonstration on the 12th to commemorate the victims under fascist rule. Demonstrators marched through the streets carrying red flags and huge banners. The various terror measures and bans announced by the Western occupying powers in Berlin failed to prevent this grand parade. In Berlin's largest amusement park, a pillar of fire commemorating the anti-fascist martyrs was lit, and the memorial meeting was held here. To commemorate this international memorial day, delegations from the Soviet Union, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and \"Free Greece\", \"Free Spain\", etc. participated. The head of the French delegation, President of the \"International Federation of Former Political Prisoners\" Lampe, the head of the Soviet delegation, Lieutenant General Gordivil, and the Chairman of the \"Association of Those Persecuted by Hitler's Rule in Germany\" Geschke (note that Geschke is a member of the Socialist Unity Party and Deputy Speaker of the Berlin City Council) and many other representatives delivered speeches at the meeting. Gordivil said: \"We Soviet anti-fascist fighters will not only support the demands of the German people, but also regard the demands of the German people as our own.\" This large-scale demonstration was also a response to the provocation by the fascists on September 9. On that day, German neo-fascists held an anti-Soviet and anti-people's rally in the western occupied area of Berlin. At the beginning of the meeting, US and British officials were at the forefront, directing everything. The head of the pro-American clique in Berlin, Reuters, the Deputy Mayor of Berlin, Friedensburg, and the head of the reactionary Berlin Social Democratic Party, Numan, openly called for civil war and a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. After the meeting, the American and French fascist Black Street teams and the newly formed Stormtrooper gangs poured into the Soviet-occupied area, rampaging and provoking, dragging away wounded police officers from the Soviet-occupied area, and firing at the Soviet-occupied area. TASS pointed out that this bloody act of the fascists has aroused deep anger among the people of Berlin. The Berlin Executive Committee of the Socialist Unity Party issued a statement calling on \"the working people of Berlin to rise up and remove the weapons from the hands of the fascist provocateurs.\" The Socialist Unity Party and various democratic groups called on the people of Berlin to participate in the large-scale demonstration on September 12 to respond to the provocations of the fascists.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Reports from various sources indicate that the so-called European Economic Cooperation Committee, comprised of nations participating in the \"Marshall Plan,\" has, after a month of incessant wrangling, still failed to reach an agreement on the allocation of $500 million in loans for the first six months of the \"Marshall Plan.\" Although the plan has been in effect for five months, no loan agreements have been concluded with any country other than Iceland, which signed a $2 million loan agreement. The main point of contention is the US insistence on increasing the allocation ratio for the Western German occupied zones, which other participating countries in the \"Marshall Plan\" oppose. Another reason for the delay is the harshness of the US loan conditions, because according to US regulations, the dollar portion of the \"Marshall Plan\" that is \"granted\" cannot be used to purchase machinery. Only the loan portion, which comes with a high interest rate of 3 percent, can be used to purchase machinery, and the total value of machinery purchased cannot exceed one percent of the total loan amount.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美国贷款条件苛刻　马歇尔计划执行五个月　只订成了一个贷款协定\n\n1948-09-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美国贷款条件苛刻\n  　马歇尔计划执行五个月\n  　只订成了一个贷款协定\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方报导：由参加“马歇尔计划”国家组成的所谓欧洲经济合作委员会，经过一个月来无休止的争吵，迄今对实行“马歇尔计划”头六个月中五亿美元贷款的分配问题，仍未获得协议。虽然该计划已执行五个月，但迄今除冰岛签订了二百万美元的贷款协定外，其他国家的贷款协定一个也没有订立。主要的争执点为美国坚持增加西德联合占领区的分配比例，而其他参加“马歇尔计划”的国家则反对这一要求。另一延迟的原因是美国贷款条件的苛刻，因为根据美国的规定，“马歇尔计划”项下“赠予”部分的美元，不能用以购买机器，只有以付出百分之三高利息得来的借款部分，才能购买机器，而购买机器的总值亦不能超过贷款总数的百分之一。"

    "content": "【Taihang Telegram】The masses in the edge regions of northern Henan, such as Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Jiaozuo, are actively demanding to protect the autumn harvest, and the militia self-defense forces have been further developed. Based on past experiences, the masses in the border areas of Xiuwu recognized the inevitability of the enemy seizing the autumn harvest, and they have requested grenades, landmines, and quick-firing guns to prepare for protecting the autumn harvest. In the past month alone, the area has developed more than 120 militiamen. A 16-year-old youth in Village × told our district cadres, \"As long as we are armed, the enemy will not be able to seize our autumn harvest, and we will definitely be able to eat it.\" A certain village that has been constantly subjected to enemy looting, after our propaganda and education, aroused the masses' hatred of the enemy and organized two blasting groups. After breaking off the connections of a few individuals with the enemy and eliminating illusions about the enemy, a certain village in Wuzhi borrowed rifles from neighboring counties and also organized a militia to launch a struggle against the enemy. The leaders of the Second District firmly supported the masses' armed demands, and the villages successively restored village command posts, established militias, organized joint defense, and launched a blasting campaign. In Xiuwu's Anyangcheng Village, Wang Jizu, a middle peasant who had been properly redressed after correcting deviations, compensating, and revising his class status, automatically requested to join the militia. He said, \"I have long wanted to be a militiaman to protect myself, but because I was said to be a rich peasant in the past, I have never dared to say anything.\" Jiaozuo also rectified its policies, corrected some of the \"leftist\" errors in the people's armed work in the past. Within twenty days, villages such as ×× restored 22 militias, newly developed 23 militiamen, and organized nearly 200 self-defense forces. In Xiuwu, the reasonable solution of issues such as the rotation of militiamen in combat, production, and combat service has greatly promoted the development of the militia. In mid-July, the county generally went through the process of calculating the work points for participation in combat, and the militiamen all received the labor service rice they deserved. Five people in Dongwanjie Village quickly joined the militia. After the Third District implemented the method of deploying militiamen on a rotational basis according to the amount of labor, the militias in the villages also experienced new development. The development and strengthening of the militia in the above-mentioned areas is an extremely important guarantee for winning the autumn harvest struggle. The militia in various places is still constantly increasing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北群众扩大民兵组织联防保卫秋收\n\n1948-09-19\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北群众扩大民兵组织联防保卫秋收\n    【太行电】豫北修武、武陟、焦作等边缘区群众积极要求保秋，民兵自卫队又获得发展。修武边地群众根据过去的体验，认识了敌人抢秋的必然到来，纷纷要求发手榴弹地雷快枪等武器，准备保秋。该地一个月来仅民兵发展一百二十多名，×村一个十六岁的青年对我区干部说：“只要武装起来，敌人就抢不走咱的秋，保险能吃到嘴里。”不断遭受敌人抢劫的某村，经我宣传教育后，激起群众对敌仇恨，组织了两个爆炸组。武陟某村在打断了个别人和敌人连系，消除了对敌的幻想后，向邻近县借到步枪，亦组织起民兵，向敌展开斗争。二区领导上坚决支持群众的武装要求，各村先后恢复村指挥部，建立起民兵，组织联防，展开了爆炸运动。修武安阳城村经过确实纠偏，补偿及改订成份后的中农王吉祖即自动请求参加了民兵，他说：“我早就想干民兵保卫自己，因过去说我是富农，我就一直不敢吭。”焦作亦由于端正政策，纠正了过去在人民武装工作中的某些左倾错误，廿天内××等村恢复民兵二十二个，新发展了民兵二十三人，组织起自卫队近二百人。在修武因合理解决轮战民兵生产及参战勤务等问题，亦大大促进了民兵的发展。该县七月中旬普遍经过算参战工帐，民兵均得到了应得的勤工米，东万解村很快就有五个人参加了民兵。三区实行按劳力多少调集民兵轮战的办法后，各村民兵亦有了新发展。上述地区民兵的发展壮大，对争取秋收斗争的胜利是一个极重要的保障，现各地民兵仍在不断增加。"

The enemy along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway in the Fourth Military Sub-district is repairing the Daokou-Qinghua Railway to Xiuwu city, planning to continue laying tracks to Daiwang before the autumn harvest; they are also building a highway to Wuliyuan, attempting to control our most grain-producing area. At the same time, the enemy has secretly planned the amount of \"grain levies\" and plundering in our border areas and some villages in adjacent core areas, and is preparing to send secret agents to investigate the situation, organize puppet village and town organizations, and prepare to plunder the autumn harvest after the enemy invades and establishes temporary strongholds. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xinxiang, Anyang, Huixian, and Ye counties in the Fifth Military Sub-district are preparing to plunder the autumn harvest, adjusting and deploying their forces. The enemy in Huixian is holding meetings; the enemy at the Huaicun camp stronghold in the county has increased by one regular army battalion, and the troop strength in the city has also continued to increase. The enemy in Anyang has made the following preparations for plundering the autumn harvest: (1) Conducting intensive training for puppet organization personnel to arrange for the plundering, the main content of which is to rectify and investigate the number of villages, security units, land, and autumn seedlings, in order to plan and assign the task of grain plundering to various regions. They have now gone to the countryside to carry out the above work. (2) Mass conscription to replenish the main force and strengthen the garrison and mobile armed forces for plundering. From July 2nd to August 20th, in nearly fifty days, they have conscripted 427 young and middle-aged men from twenty-eight villages in our border areas. At the same time, the enemy also forced the conscription of more than 200 men from the armed forces of various puppet villages and towns to serve as the backbone of new recruits and is concentrating on training them in Anyang city. (3) Robbing and developing maintenance forces everywhere to expand the autumn plundering front. Since July, the enemy has successively carried out large and small-scale \"mopping-up\" operations and raids in our weak areas such as Dangzhonggang, Panjia'an, Gao Xiaotun, and Beiqugou, attempting to defeat our people's armed forces and border organizational institutions, threatening to maintain order, but they have all been repelled by us.

This is a major political task for the border region's farmers to improve agricultural production at present.\"\n\nThe editorial pointed out: \"Due to the devastation caused by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the labor, livestock, farm implements, and rations of the masses have suffered severe losses, resulting in generally rough cultivation. In areas that were liberated later, as well as border areas, spring plowing was missed, or the cultivated area was greatly reduced due to frequent harassment by Kuomintang troops. The serious drought this spring, and the continued drought in some areas this year; the repeated warfare in the Huanglong New District, and the lack of organizational leadership experience among some cadres in the New District; therefore, the recovery of grain this year will not be very large, and grain shortages may still occur next year. In order to smoothly expand production next year, we must mobilize and organize all the people to vigorously expand the planting of winter wheat.\"\n\nThe editorial called for expanding the existing six million mu of wheat fields by another 600,000 mu. Each sub-region must ensure that all existing wheat fields are planted, and strive to plant as much winter wheat as possible in areas where it was previously planted less or not at all. To this end, it is necessary to implement correct land policies, consolidate the farmers' enthusiasm for production, appropriately organize the labor force, and strive to improve wheat planting techniques.\n\nThe editorial pointed out that the central key to completing this major task lies in the correct, timely, and meticulous organization and leadership of local party and government personnel.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁群众日报号召：广种冬麦增产粮食\n\n1948-09-19\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁群众日报号召：\n    广种冬麦增产粮食\n    【新华社西北十五日电】陕甘宁边区群众日报顷发表社论，号召广种冬麦。社论称：抓紧时间，组织起来，广种冬麦，增产粮食，这是目前边区农民提高农业生产的一个重大政治任务。社论指出：由于国民党匪军的摧残，群众的劳力、畜力、农具、口粮受到严重损失，使耕作一般都较粗糙；光复较晚地区，以及边沿地区，春耕失去时机，或由于国民党军经常骚扰，耕地面积大量减少；今春的严重灾荒与今年部分地区继续遭受灾荒；黄龙新区战争反复，新区部分干部缺乏组织领导生产经验；因此今年粮食的收复量不会很大，明年的粮食还可能发生困难。为使明年能顺利扩大生产，必须动员与组织全体人民，大力广种冬麦。社论号召在现有的六百万亩麦田的基础上，再扩大六十万亩。各分区要保证原有的麦田全都种上，并争取过去少种、没有种过的地区尽量多种冬麦。为此必须执行正确的土地政策，巩固农民生产积极性，适当地组织劳动力，并在种麦的技术上力求改进。社论指出，完成这一重大任务的中心关键，在于各地党政人员正确、及时、细密的组织与领导。"

    "content": "Party, Government, Army, and People Unite in Struggle\n  　Gao Village Successfully Rescued\n    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 17th] The Gao Village dangerous work site on the southern bank of the Yellow River in Dongming, which the people of the whole country are concerned about, has been turned from danger to safety after two months of joint and courageous repairs by the Party, government, army, and people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area. Since the People's Liberation Army recovered Gao Village on June 19th, it has mobilized more than 45,000 civilian laborers and more than 8,000 livestock, transporting more than 200,000 bricks and more than 300 catties of willow branches, and worked hard to repair the dams and weirs destroyed by the Kuomintang army during its occupation. Just as the entire project was about to be completed, it was forced to stop because the Kuomintang bandit army reoccupied the area on July 20th. Wherever the bandit army went, it robbed materials and dug up fortifications, causing the cross-corner of the dangerous work site to collapse into the water, and the 13th and 14th dams were in danger. After the bandit army fled south on the 31st, the employees of the Yellow River Commission's River Repair Department immediately crossed the river at night to resume the emergency repair project, overcoming numerous difficulties, completing the preliminary project from the 13th dam to the 16th dam, and adding two new dams between the 14th and 15th dams. On August 9th, just as the project was completed, unexpectedly, the main flow shifted to below the 16th dam, and the riverbed was fiercely scoured by the flood, eroding 20 meters wide in one day. At this time, the emergency repair headquarters decided to build four new dams below the 16th dam. That night, the foundation of the 17th dam and the brick and willow weir had been mostly completed, but because they could not withstand the scouring of the main flow, they completely collapsed into the water, and the situation was dangerous. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office and the Yellow River Commission urgently decided that, in addition to transporting straw materials from Changyuan and Kunwu (newly established county) on the north bank to provide support, they also consulted with nearby residents and agreed to cut down green sorghum stalks and stick them to the base of the dike to rush to make more than 400 meters of revetment to protect the dike; at the same time, the back of the dike was thickened; and a ring dike was repaired between Baidian and Houchang to prevent the main dike from breaching. By the 12th, half of the 18th dam had been built, but due to continuous enemy air raids, much time was lost, causing a one-meter crack in the dam, facing the danger of breaching, and the scattered air defense civilian workers had not yet gathered. More than 100 of our cadres bravely and fearlessly transported 50,000 catties of willow branches and straw materials, and urgently repaired it, and it was stabilized in the evening. On the afternoon of the 13th, the 18th dam was almost washed away due to continuous strafing by Chiang's planes, and the danger had reached its extreme. Fortunately, all the employees risked the enemy planes' crazy strafing and desperately rescued it, and finally escaped. During our emergency repair period, Chiang's bandits carried out all kinds of sabotage. According to statistics for only ten days from July 7th to 16th, more than 150 emergency repair employees were killed or injured by enemy planes. However, thanks to the strong leadership of our democratic government and the heroic struggle of all employees, the danger was finally turned into safety. In particular, the support of the residents along the river on the north bank for the emergency repair on the south bank is an unprecedented initiative in the history of Yellow River management.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 党政军民合力奋斗　高村抢险成功\n\n1948-09-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　党政军民合力奋斗\n  　高村抢险成功\n    【新华社华北十七日电】全国人民所关切的黄河南岸东明高村险工，经两月来冀鲁豫解放区党政军民各方合力奋勇抢修，现已转危为安。自六月十九日解放军收复高村后，即曾动员民工四万五千余人，牲口八千余头，运砖料二十余万块，柳枝三百余斤，奋力抢修国民党军侵占时所破坏之各坝埽，正当全工将竣之际，因国民党匪军于七月廿日重占该处而被迫停工。匪军所至，到处抢工料，挖工事，致使该险工跨角坍塌入水，十三、十四两坝告急。迄三十一日匪军南窜后，我黄委会修黄处员工当即星夜南渡，恢复抢险工程，克服重重困难，完成十三坝至十六坝的初步工程，并在十四、十五坝之间加修新坝两道。至八月九日，工程刚成，不料大溜移至十六坝以下，河床被洪流凶猛淘刷，一天即淘去二十公尺宽。此时，抢险指挥部乃决定在十六坝以下添筑四道新坝。当夜十七坝坝基与砖柳埽本已完成大半，但因抗不住大溜冲刷，完全坍入水中，形势险恶。冀鲁豫行署与黄委会乃紧急决定，除由北岸长垣、昆吾（新设县）两县赶运秸料支援外，并商得附近居民同意，砍倒青高粱秆，贴堤根抢作四百余公尺长的护沿，以护大堤；同时加厚堤背；并于白店至后场间补修圈堤，以防大堤决口。至十二日，十八坝已修起一半，奈因敌机连续袭扰，误工多时，致该坝裂口一公尺，面临决口危险，而四散防空民工尚未集合，我百余干部乃奋不顾身，亲自搬运柳枝秸料五万余斤，紧急抢修，至晚始形稳住。十三日下午，又因蒋机连续扫射而误工，致十八坝几被冲跑，危险已达极点，幸赖全体员工冒敌机疯狂扫射，拼命抢救，终得脱险。在我抢险期中，蒋匪曾进行百般破坏，仅据七月七日至十六日十天统计，抢险员工死伤于匪机之下者，即达一百五十余人。然赖我民主政府之坚强领导与全体员工之英勇奋斗，终于化险为夷。尤以北岸沿河居民支援南岸抢险，更为治黄史上之创举。"

The meetings conveyed, studied, and arranged the work for the autumn and winter seasons, and preparations are being made to train another three thousand people before winter, for a total of five thousand people. Before the meetings, most cadres were concerned about party rectification after the autumn harvest and felt unable to lead the work. The masses were also waiting for land redistribution after the autumn harvest and were in an uneasy mood. During the meetings and training, each county reviewed past work and the extent of land reform, explained policies with specific issues, allowing the vast number of cadres to understand the policies thoroughly. After studying various specific issues in class demarcation and the conclusion of land reform, realistic plans were formulated, and work was arranged. Everyone became clear about the general principles and policies, work tasks, and goals. After the meetings, in order to quickly stabilize the farmers' production sentiment and promote the autumn harvest and wheat planting, each county, based on specific circumstances, pre-set the villages to conclude land reform before autumn. Thirty-two in Shahe, forty-nine in Shexian, one hundred and thirty in Cixian, and sixty-nine in Wu'an. These villages were assigned a certain number of cadres to begin various specific tasks to conclude land reform. It is generally expected that it can be completed in about twenty days (Cixian has too many villages to conclude, and it is not certain that all can be completed). At the same time, some cadres were also assigned to lead the masses to collect fertilizer in preparation for planting wheat. The cadres leading the conclusion of land reform also started by leading production to understand the situation. They also convened party member meetings, peasant association group meetings, mass meetings, and other gatherings to publicize policies, and then specifically proceeded. Currently, each county is carrying out the work intensely.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 六专贯彻会议精神　训练区村干部二千\n\n1948-09-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　六专贯彻会议精神\n  　训练区村干部二千\n    【本报讯】中共太行六地委报导：六专各县为贯彻区党委八月会议（县委联席会）决议完成结束土改，整党，建政，开展冬季生产运动，各县均先后召开了扩大干部会议，训练区村干部达两千余人。传达研究布置了秋冬两季工作。并准备在冬前再训练三千人，共五千人。会前，干部大多对秋后整党有顾虑，对工作感觉无法领导。群众亦在等待秋后抽补土地，情绪不安。会议及训练中，各县都回顾了过去工作和土改程度，用具体问题解释了政策，使广大干部对政策摸了底。并经研究划阶级与结束土改中各种具体问题，实际订计划，安排工作，大家对方针政策与工作任务、目的都明确起来。会后，各县为迅速安定农民生产情绪，推进秋收种麦，都根据具体情况，预订了秋前结束土改村庄。沙河三十二个；涉县四十九个；磁县一百三十个；武安六十九个。这些村都配备一定的干部开始进行各种具体的结束土改工作。一般预计二十天左右可以完成（磁县结束村太多，不一定都能完成）。与此同时，也配备了一部分干部领导群众集肥，准备种麦。领导结束土改的干部，也是先从领导生产入手，了解情况。同时召开党员会、农会小组会、群众大会等宣传政策，然后具体进行。现各县均在紧张进行中。"

    "content": "Taihang Telegram: In order to better organize the masses for production and support the war, the Taihang Saltpeter and Sulphur Administration Bureau held a meeting of branch and county bureau chiefs in mid-August to summarize the achievements of saltpeter and sulphur work over the past year. Thanks to the strong assistance of party, government, and military leaders at all levels in the region, and the masses' practical experience of the benefits of the saltpeter and sulphur industry, the saltpeter and sulphur industry has developed rapidly. The number of saltpeter producing areas has increased from 15 counties in four special districts to 37 counties in six special districts. The quantity of saltpeter produced has almost doubled compared to last year, and the quality of saltpeter has also improved significantly. After 14 days of discussion, the meeting determined the future direction and specific methods of saltpeter and sulphur production: (1) Organize labor for saltpeter and sulphur production, quickly correct the past \"leftist\" errors that caused losses to saltpeter and sulphur production, and compensate saltpeter operators who were wrongly struggled against to restore their production. In the old areas, the focus is on consolidating and restoring saltpeter and sulphur work, improving technology, increasing production, and ensuring quality. In the new areas, the focus is on developing mass saltpeter production, training technical personnel, and gradually improving quantity and quality. (2) According to the different conditions in different regions, production can be organized in roughly three ways: partnership, mutual aid, and independent operation. In practice, these are small workshops and household sideline businesses. Regardless of the form of organization, the three principles of voluntariness, equivalent exchange, and democracy must be adhered to. (3) In terms of business management, it is necessary to improve the organizational structure of saltpeter workshops and combine them with the government for unified management, inspection, and guidance, such as registering and issuing production licenses, strictly adhering to economic procedures, formulating reasonable profit-sharing methods and simple rules, and educating workers. (4) The regulations on the price of saltpeter and the price of ash should be based on the principles of not wasting military expenses, not increasing the burden on the people, benefiting both public and private interests, and supporting the front lines. To stimulate production, rewards should be given for high output, and quality should be graded. Free purchase of ash should be encouraged, and apportionment should be minimized, with a price of one to four liang of millet per jin of ash to compensate the masses for fertilizer losses. (5) Each bureau must strictly implement the interim accounting system, and all receipts, disbursements of grain and money, and expense reimbursements must be signed and sealed by the bureau chief and deputy bureau chief. Public funds must not be borrowed under any circumstances. Opposition to one-sided worker interests and relief views in production.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Comprehensive reports from various sources: Since the Kuomintang reactionary government announced the implementation of \"currency reform\" on the 19th of last month, freezing prices and adopting violent means to \"control the economy,\" legitimate transactions in markets throughout its ruling areas have been paralyzed, and black market transactions and material flight have become widespread. Taking Shanghai, the economic center of the Kuomintang-controlled area, as an example, according to a Reuters report on the 10th, \"Business in all industries in Shanghai has almost completely come to a standstill.\" \"This is partly due to government regulations freezing prices, which merchants strongly resist, and partly due to the government's implementation of strict economic controls.\" The agency's reporter has requested the London headquarters to report the stagnation of the Shanghai market to the British government, as this situation has \"seriously affected our (British) business.\" Furthermore, according to the agency's telegram on the same day, citing the Ta Mei Wan Pao's commentary on the market stagnation, if this situation continues, \"Shanghai is likely to face a massive wave of unemployment due to the closure of factories and businesses.\" Since the Chiang bandits began large-scale inspections of warehouses and storage yards in Shanghai at the end of August, merchants have used various methods to evade them. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 2nd, \"In the past week,\" Shanghai's economic police (secret agents) have been constantly searching warehouses and inspecting stored goods. Many merchants moved their goods away before the police arrived. When the police arrived, they found that thirty-two warehouses were empty.\" Although airports, docks, and stations in Shanghai are full of economic secret agents to prevent material flight, the post office parcel department is filled with packages of cotton yarn and cloth about to be shipped out. Flour and rice are also being transported to private residences. Some merchants even \"hire mobile vehicles, load them with their goods, and cruise the streets day and night\" (Associated Press). At the same time, \"Merchants are conducting 'mobile' black market transactions. They move stockpiled goods from one place to another\" (Reuters, Shanghai, 7th). Therefore, according to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 8th, quoting a merchant, \"It is impossible to do business according to the prices stipulated by the order.

Under the Nationalist government's \"currency reform\" followed by \"price controls\" and \"tax increases,\" Tianjin's industry and commerce have been severely impacted. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on August 28th, the complaints of people in Tianjin's business community included: (1) The selling price of finished products is uniformly pegged to the price on August 19th. However, the price of raw materials is not controlled. Raw material prices rise every day, but the price of finished products cannot be set according to cost, causing factories to suffer heavy losses. For example, on August 19th, a bale of 20-count yarn sold for 2.2 billion yuan, but the current price of cotton has risen to 500 million yuan per dan (unit of weight). According to cost calculations, each bale of yarn now loses 600 million yuan. (2) The price of imported equipment and raw materials has suddenly increased. Before the 19th, importers settled foreign exchange at a rate of 8 million legal tender per US dollar. After the \"currency reform,\" the legal rate was 12 million legal tender per US dollar. In addition, import taxes have also increased, so the burden on raw materials and equipment needed by factories has increased by 55 percent compared to the past, while the finished products produced are sold at the original price. (3) The Nationalist government's banks have canceled industrial loans and switched to borrowing at high interest rates.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 天津工商界一片诉苦声\n\n1948-09-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　天津工商界一片诉苦声\n    【新华社陕北十六日电】在国民党政府实行所谓“币制改革”后的“限价”和“增税”政策下，天津工商业受极大打击。据八月二十八日天津大公报披露天津工商界人士所陈诉的痛苦情形称：（一）成品出售价格一律照八月十九日价格钉住。但原料价格却未在管制之列。原料天天涨，成品不能依照成本订价，工厂赔累不堪。如八月十九日二十支纱一包售价二十二亿元，而目前棉花每担售价已涨达五亿元，照成本计算，则目前每包纱赔累六亿元之巨。（二）进口器材原料价格突增。十九日以前进口商结汇美元一元兑换法币八百万元，“币改”后美金一元合法币一千二百万元，加以进口税又有增加，因而各工厂所需要之原料器材进口较之过去增加负担百分之五十五，而所产成品则按原价销售。（三）国民党政府银行取消工业贷款，改为借款收高息。"

    "content": "(Taihang Electric) In early August, the Taihang District Party Committee held a joint meeting of all county party committees to convey the spirit of the North China Bureau's July meeting and to arrange winter work. The conference reviewed the land reform in the Taihang District over the past few years, explaining that land reform had been thorough. However, serious left-leaning errors had occurred during the land reform process, such as infringing upon the interests of middle peasants and industry and commerce. It was not until the land conference in the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region last winter that the correction of these errors began. Since the implementation of the policy of combining large-scale production with rectification of deviations in the May conference this year, the work in the entire district has undergone significant changes. Currently, the thinking of cadres has been largely clarified, the volatile emotions of the masses and social order have stabilized, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production has also significantly increased. Based on the above specific circumstances, it was decided that the guiding principle for winter work should be to end land reform, rectify the Party, establish political power, and simultaneously launch a winter production campaign. The central task in the entire work process is Party rectification. In terms of work steps and arrangements, a large number of district and village cadres must be trained before the autumn harvest, with all district cadres receiving training and at least five or six village cadres being trained in each village. By late September, cadres should be in the villages. Each district should be divided into about five key points, and work teams should be organized to lead the work of each village in conjunction with village cadres. After arriving in the villages, the first task is to lead the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat planting, vigorously consolidate cooperatives, and prepare for winter production. At the same time, conduct investigations and research to understand the problems in land reform and Party rectification; and, without affecting production, complete the work of ending land reform in as many villages as possible. After the autumn harvest, preliminary rectification of the Party and peasant organizations should be carried out, and temporary people's congresses should be established to end land reform. After the end of land reform, Party rectification will be carried out, and this work must be done carefully and meticulously. After Party rectification, formal people's representatives and village committees will be elected, and the village-level democratic system will be established. In February and March of next year, a county-level people's congress will be convened to elect county-level governments, mobilize production, and launch a large-scale production campaign. Party rectification requires meticulousness and stability, and preparations should be made for Party rectification when land reform is completed. The establishment of political power should be combined with the end of land reform and Party rectification. For winter production, it is required to vigorously consolidate cooperatives before autumn and rely on cooperatives to carry out the work. After the end of land reform, areas where Party rectification has not yet taken place should focus on production, while areas where Party rectification is taking place should focus on Party rectification, while also taking care of production. The 500 experimental villages in the entire district (villages where land reform and democratic Party rectification were carried out this spring) must do a good job in the winter production campaign. When the production season arrives in February of next year, the entire district will fully launch a large-scale production campaign. The conference especially emphasized establishing clear policy thinking, strengthening organization and discipline, strengthening close ties between higher and lower levels, timely inspection and reporting, and opposing empiricism, in order to strengthen leadership.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行县委联席会布置秋冬工作　结束土改进行整党  建立民主制度开展大生产\n\n1948-09-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行县委联席会布置秋冬工作\n  　结束土改进行整党\n    建立民主制度开展大生产\n    【太行电】八月初旬，太行区党委召开全区县委联席会议，传达华北局七月会议，布置冬季工作。大会对太行区几年来的土地改革作了回顾，说明土地改革已经彻底，但是在土改过程中，曾发生严重的左倾错误，如侵犯中农和工商业等。直到去冬晋冀鲁豫全区土地会议以后，才开始了对这些错误的纠正。今年五月会议转向大生产结合纠偏的方针施行以来，全区工作获得显著转变。目前干部思想大体澄清了，群众的动荡情绪和社会秩序已趋稳定，群众的生产积极性也显著提高了。根据以上具体情况，决定冬季工作的方针应该是结束土改、整党、建政，并平行的开展冬季生产运动。在整个工作中，以整党为中心。在工作的步骤与安排上，秋收以前必须大量训练区村干部，区干部普训一遍，村干部每村至少训练五六人。九月下旬干部都要到村。每区划分五个左右的基点，组织工作组，结合村干部，领导各村工作。到村之后，首先要领导秋收、秋耕、种麦，大力整顿合作社，准备冬季生产。同时进行调查研究，了解土改及整党中的问题；并在不影响生产的条件下，尽可能进行一部村庄结束土改的工作。秋收后，即初步整顿党与农民等组织，建立临时的人代会，进行结束土改。土改结束后，进行整党，这一工作要求谨慎而细致的去做。整党之后，选举正式人民代表和村政委员会，把村级民主制度建立起来。明年二、三月间，召开县级人民代表会，选举县级政府，动员生产，开展大规模的生产运动。对整党要求细致稳当，并在结束土改时，为整党作准备。对建政，要求与结束土改和整党结合进行。对于冬季生产，要求在秋前大力整顿合作社，依托合作社进行。土改结束之后，暂时不整党的地方以生产为主，整党的地方以整党为中心，同时照顾生产。整党完了即全力进行生产。全区五百个实验村（今年春天进行土改、民主整党的村），一定要把冬季生产运动搞好。到明年二月生产季节到来，全区即全力开展大生产运动。会议特别强调树立明确的政策思想，加强组织性，纪律性，密切上下连系，及时检查汇报，反对经验主义，以加强领导。"

These include the match, wine, soap, leather, textile, pine root oil, paper making, glass, ironwork, dyeing, printing, and clothing industries. The recovery and development of the match industry is particularly remarkable. One small match factory in the area, which had been shut down for over a year, has been reorganized and rebuilt. In the past, each clamp-lever machine produced less than ten boxes per day, but now it can produce over 21 boxes at its peak. The Lion brand matches produced now contain 80 to 90 or even 100 matchsticks per small box, compared to 70 in the past, and are guaranteed to be durable and ignite every time. Furthermore, the chemical raw materials used have been reduced by over 16% compared to the past. Tonghua wine is a famous specialty of Northeast China, and it has maintained its excellent quality after resuming production. The manufacturing of pine root oil had no achievements under the puppet Manchukuo regime. However, after nearly a year of efforts by the democratic government, preliminary success has been achieved. The crude oil (raw “Mingzi” oil after the first distillation) and refined oil (raw oil after the second distillation) can generally be used as substitutes for gasoline in automobiles. The refined oil, in particular, has a high explosive power and a flash point of 45 degrees Celsius, making it especially convenient to use in the summer. It is generally believed that the gas power is even greater than that of gasoline. The oil yield of \"Mingzi\" is 5%, and the total cost is less than half the selling price of gasoline. There are also by-products such as lubricating oil (which can be used as mechanical lubricating oil), wood vinegar, wood alcohol, and black oil, which have significant uses in industry and medicine. In addition, there are many new types of industries emerging in the area, such as using soybean oil to make hard soap, using various animal fats or soybean oil to make fine scented soap, using machinery to manufacture various chemical leathers (such as textured leather and suede), and manufacturing cutting, weaving, pressing, and root-pulling machines and glassware for agricultural and industrial use. Although the scale is not large and the technology is still preliminary, it has made a significant contribution to the local people.

    "content": "【Taihang Dispatch】The iron industry in Libi Village, Pindin County, has begun to prosper after its recovery. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were several iron furnaces in the village, operating individually. The workers only had tools and no capital, relying entirely on selling their labor to earn a living. During the Anti-Japanese War, the iron furnaces collapsed and workers lost their jobs due to Japanese destruction. After the Japanese surrender, the government provided a loan of 300,000 to help restore them. Initially, six furnaces were organized with 34 workers, producing on a small scale. However, due to poor technology, they could only make hoe blades and sales were limited, only selling in Yu County. Later, to expand sales, they developed the production of iron shovels, wrought iron shovels, and flower cart axles. Subsequently, sales expanded to Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Xingtai and other places, and production gradually increased. In just over a year, the number of furnaces increased from six to sixteen, and the number of workers increased to eighty. In the spring of 1947, Yan Xishan's troops caused widespread disruption, and the iron furnaces were once again forced to stop. After the liberation of Pindin City last year, the government again provided a loan of 30 shi of grain to help restore business, and established the Juxing Iron Factory. A manager was democratically elected, staff were assigned, and technicians were hired to train technical personnel. It quickly developed to nineteen furnaces, and the number of workers increased to eighty again. However, due to inconvenient transportation, sales were sluggish at the time, and production was affected by a lack of capital. Under these layers of difficulties, the workers still maintained a high level of production enthusiasm. Everyone agreed that they were not afraid of not having sales, but only afraid of not being able to make goods. As long as there was inventory, sales would open up and money could be earned. With the unanimous agreement of the employees, wages were temporarily not earned, and inventory was accumulated instead (because the factory was a labor-capital cooperative with profit sharing between labor and capital). From September last year to April this year, iron shovels, wrought iron plowshares for cultivated land, hoe blades, etc., and a batch of sundries were made. After selling these finished products, they were exchanged for oil, salt, cloth, etc. for sale. During this period, after deducting all expenses, a net profit of 13,070,000 yuan was earned. The main reasons for making money were: 1. The leadership took the lead. For example, Zhang Renfu, the chairman of the trade union, set an example, was able to endure hardship, and was not selfish. The workers had a high degree of production enthusiasm, were able to start from long-term interests, and were able to actively produce and accumulate finished products without earning wages in the most difficult circumstances. 2. Good management. They were able to grasp the economic situation, find production opportunities in many ways, and organically combine industry and commerce. For example, Yue Cunjin, the purchasing and sales agent, listened to what goods were fast-moving and what agricultural tools were needed, and then had the furnaces make them. The funds from the sale of iron goods were used for reproduction, buying daily necessities such as oil, salt, and cloth to transport to the local area. In addition to solving the needs of the workers, a part was sold to earn money again. 3. The workers' skills gradually improved, and the output became more and more numerous and better every day.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 工人发挥高度生产热情　立壁铁业产品提高\n\n1948-09-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　工人发挥高度生产热情\n  　立壁铁业产品提高\n    【太行电】平定立壁村的铁工业，经过恢复，已开始走向繁荣。该村抗战前就有几家铁炉，生产方式是个体经营，工人们只有工具没有资本，完全靠出卖劳力来获得生活资料。抗战期间由于日寇摧残，铁炉垮台，工人失业。日寇投降后，政府以三十万贷款扶助，又逐渐恢复起来。先组织六盘炉，工人三十四人，小规模的进行生产。但因技术差，只能打锄板，销路不广，仅能出售盂县一地。后为扩展销路，就发展到打铁锹，熟铁锹，轧花车轴等，以后销路推广到元氏、赞皇、邢台等地，生产日渐增加。一年多光景由六盘炉发展到十六盘，工人增加到八十人。一九四七年春阎顽大肆扰乱，铁炉又一度被迫停止。去年平定城解放，政府又以三十石贷粮扶助恢复营业，成立了聚兴铁厂，民选经理，配备职员，聘请技师培养技工人员，很快就发展到十九盘炉，工人又增至八十人。但因交通不便，当时销路不畅，资本缺乏，生产受到影响。在这层层困难下，工人们仍保持高度生产热忱，大家一致认为不怕没销路，只怕做不下货，只要有存货，销路一通，钱就能赚到手，在职工一致同意下，暂且不赚工资，往起存货（因该厂是劳资合作、劳资分红的工厂）。从去年九月到今年四月，制成铁锹、耕地熟铁铧、锄板等和一部杂货。出售这些成品后，换回油盐布等出售，这期间除了一切开支，净赚红利一千三百零七万余元。赚钱的主要原因是：一、领导起带头作用。如工会主席张仁福以身作则，能吃苦，不自私。工人有高度的生产热情，能从长远利益出发，在最困难的情况下能不赚工资，积极生产，积存成品。二、善于经营。能掌握经济情况，多方找生产门路，并使工商业有机结合，如采卖员岳存金在外，听那里什么货快、需要什么农具，就让炉上打什么。并将出售铁货的款用于再生产，买成油盐布等日用品运来本地，除解决工人需用外，出售一部，再入进去赚钱。三、工人的技术逐渐提高，出品一天比一天多而且好。"

    "content": "[Taihang Telegraph] The Lincheng Fangnao Village Cooperative, which organizes villagers' production according to seasonal changes and mass needs and is growing stronger, was recognized as a model cooperative in the county at the recent county-wide meeting to rectify cooperatives. The village is a remote and scattered small village, far from the market town, making it very inconvenient for the masses to purchase daily necessities, and the sale of local products is also quite difficult. Therefore, the cooperative has a mixed business of production and consumption, and has achieved great results in organizing mass production over the past year. Last July, it organized the villagers to beat a total of 19,000 catties of black leaves in eight days, and transported 7,000 catties to Loudi, earning a total profit of 456,000 yuan. It cooperated with the Shangweisi Village Cooperative to boil 2,200 catties of black leaf paste, earning a profit of 2.96 million yuan. After deducting expenses, the two village cooperatives divided it equally, each receiving a net profit of 1.05 million yuan. During the paste boiling, the cooperative also organized the masses to collect 86,000 catties of firewood, earning 6 yuan per catty, for a profit of 516,000 yuan. The masses and the cooperative both made money, and the difficulty of dye supply was also solved. Last winter, it organized the masses to pick 1,600 catties of oak valleys, earning a profit of 197,000 yuan. This spring, in order to overcome the spring famine, the cooperative led a 100-day textile movement, responsible for supplying raw materials and tools, buying a total of 280 catties of cotton, manufacturing six looms and twelve spinning wheels for the masses, and newly cultivating six weaving women and seven spinning women. The number of households in the village who do not buy cloth to wear has reached 30% of the village (in the past, the area did not know how to spin and weave), overcoming the spring famine. When apricot kernels came down, it purchased apricot kernels and organized elementary school students to pick three stones and two dou of apricot kernels, 400 yuan per dou, and the students earned a profit of 12,800 yuan, solving the difficulty of stationery. After weeding the fields, when there was no work to do due to drought, the cooperative seized the gap to organize the masses to dig medicinal materials, and the cooperative was responsible for selling them. The masses earned a total profit of 190,000 yuan. During the rush planting after the rain, it also organized the remaining labor of mutual aid groups to raise 5,600 pieces of stone slabs, earning 280,000 yuan in silver dollars. In order to support the masses in raising silkworms, the cooperative purchased silk and organized workers to make 110 catties of silk. The cooperative earned 700,000 yuan in silver dollars, exchanging a large amount of textile raw materials. Under the correct business direction, the cooperative's business is expanding day by day. When it was established in 1939, the share capital was only over 1,000 yuan, which was a small grocery store, opening its doors every five days, specializing in supplying the masses with daily necessities. After rent reduction in 1942, the share capital expanded to 4,000 yuan, and the cooperative was formally formed, leading the masses to overcome disasters. At that time, the profit from textile was great, but no one in the village knew how to spin and weave. The cooperative, on the one hand, used the calculation of interests to mobilize the masses, and on the other hand, organized outsiders to teach techniques. The village cooperative was responsible for supplying raw materials and selling finished products. At that time, although the scale of textile in the whole village was very small, it played a great role in helping the masses to overcome disasters, and the masses supported it very much. Each time the dividends are distributed, the dividends are reinvested as shares. Up to now, the share capital has expanded to 3.3 million yuan, and there is a pharmacy. All 119 households in the village have shares. The three cadres in the cooperative, in addition to the cooperative providing food and clothing, the production difficulties in their homes are solved by the masses helping with work, and the cooperative pays wages to solve them. The reason why the cooperative can guarantee the regular correctness of its business is that the cooperative has established a sound democratic system, and consults with the masses in case of trouble. Members hold meetings every half month to reflect the opinions of the masses on the cooperative to the supervisory committee. According to the opinions of the masses, the board of directors inspects the work of the village cooperative once a month to determine the work for the next month. Recently, the cooperative has set out a plan for the coming year: to breed 30 cattle and donkeys, to achieve that the whole village does not buy cloth to wear through textile, to develop from the existing 270 sheep to 1,000, to solve the fertilizer problem in the whole village, to plant 180 mulberry trees, and to develop silkworm rearing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 按季节变化和群众需要　随时注意组织生产　方垴合作社当了模范\n\n1948-09-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　按季节变化和群众需要\n  　随时注意组织生产\n  　方垴合作社当了模范\n    【太行电】按季节变化和群众需要组织村民生产，日益发展壮大的临城方垴村合作社，在此次全县整顿合作社会议上，被公认为全县模范合作社。该村是一偏僻分散的小村，离集镇很远，群众购买日用必需品很不方便，土产销售亦颇为困难，因此该社是生产与消费的混合业务，一年来组织群众生产，得到很大成绩。去年七月组织全村群众在八日内共打黑叶一万九千斤，往楼底运输了七千斤，共得利四十五万六千元。与上围寺村社合熬黑叶膏二千二百斤，获利二百九十六万元。除花费外，两村社对半分，各得净利一百零五万元。熬膏中，该社并组织群众打柴八万六千斤，每斤六元，得利五十一万六千元。群众、社里都赚了钱，又解决了染料困难。去年冬季组织群众拾橡谷一千六百斤，得利十九万七千元。今春为渡过春荒，该社领导开展百日纺织运动，负责供给原料和工具，共买棉花二百八十斤，给群众制造织布机六张，纺车十二架，新培养了织妇六个，纺妇七个。全村不买布穿的户数已达全村百分之三十（过去该地不会纺织）战胜了春荒。杏核下来时，收买杏仁，组织小学生拾杏核三石二斗，每斗四百元，学生得利一万二千八百元，解决了文具困难。锄完地后，天旱没活做，该社抓紧空隙组织群众刨药材，社里负责出售，群众共得利十九万元。雨后抢种中，又组织互助组剩余劳力起石板五千六百块，赚洋二十八万元。为扶植群众养蚕，合作社收买蚕丝，组织工人打丝一百一十斤，合作社赚洋七十万元，大量换回纺织原料。在正确的业务方向下，该社营业日益扩大。一九三九年成立时股金只有一千余元，是一小杂货铺，五天一开门，专门供给群众日用必需品。四二年经过减租，股金扩大到四千元，合作社正式形成，即领导群众渡灾荒。当时纺织利大，但该村没一个人会纺织。合作社一面用计算利益发动群众，一面组织外来户传授技术，村社负责供给原料，推销成品。当时全村纺织规模虽然很小，但帮助群众渡过灾荒的作用颇大，群众非常拥护。每次分红，均将红利再作股入进，到现在止，股金已扩大到三百三十万元，并有药铺一座，全村一百一十九户，家家入股。社里三个干部，除社供给吃穿外，家中生产困难由群众帮工，社里出工资解决。该社所以能保证营业的经常正确，是社里建立了一种优良的民主制度，遇事和群众商量。社员半月开会一次，向监事会反映群众对合作社意见。理事会根据群众意见，一月一次检查村社工作，确定下月工作。最近该社定出今后一年计划：繁殖牲口牛驴三十头，纺织作到全村不买布穿，从现有二百七十只羊发展到一千只，解决全村肥料问题，栽桑树一百八十棵，发展养蚕。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-20",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "North Yue Region Expected to Achieve 70% of a Normal Harvest, According to Preliminary Agricultural Assessment.\n\n[North Yue Electric Dispatch] The North Yue Administrative Office recently conducted preliminary assessments of the overall annual harvest based on survey materials from various regions. Using the average normal yield since the Anti-Japanese War as a benchmark, the following is projected: First Special District (Guangling, Lingqiu, Fanshi, Yingxian, Yanggao, Datong, Hunyuan) 80%, Third Special District (Liangshui, Fangshan, Laizhuo, Wanping, Liangxiang, Changwan, Huailai) 70%, Fourth Special District (Lingshou, Pingshan, Fuping, Quyang, Xingtang, Zhengding, Jianping, Jingxing, Huolu) 60%, Fifth Special District (Tangxian, Wanxian, Wangdu, Mancheng, Yixian, Xushui, Dingyu, Laiyuan) 70%, Sixth Special District (Zhuolu, Yuxian, Xuanhua, Tianzhen, Yangyuan, Hairen) 80%. Crops in unaffected areas across the region are growing reasonably well. Therefore, the overall estimated harvest for the region is 70% of normal. The basis for this estimate is as follows:\n\nAt the start of the spring plowing season, rainfall was well-distributed, and war mobilization had little impact on production. These factors laid a favorable foundation for this year's harvest. However, very little land was plowed last autumn, and fertilizer accumulation was less than half of the normal amount. Furthermore, since summer, localized droughts, hail, wind, floods, and insect infestations have occurred successively, all having some impact on the harvest.\n\nDrought: After rainfall in early June, most areas (the Sixth Special District had some rain, and other special districts had scattered showers) did not receive rain for more than forty days until July 20th. Water levels in rivers within the region dropped, and canal water volume was insufficient. In some parts of the Fourth Special District, even wells dried up. The average wheat yield was only seven or eight *shi* per *mu* (normal yield is about one *shi*). In Pingshan and Jingxing, more than two-thirds of the seedlings along the road dried up due to drought. In Hongzidian, Jianping County, leaves fell off the trees due to drought. In the Seventh District of Lingqiu, 5,431 *mu* of peas dried up. Seedlings in sandy soil in the Third Special District also showed signs of drying up. It is estimated that losses due to drought will be between 10% and 20%, with the Fourth Special District being the most severely affected.\n\nHail: Around June, the First Special District suffered three hailstorms. Affected villages were scattered across the counties of the entire district. Incomplete statistics from Datong, Hunyuan, Lingqiu, and Guangling alone show that the affected area reached 25,600 *mu*. In the Third Special District, statistics from only two villages in the Second District of Huailai show that more than seven *qing* of seedlings were destroyed. Eleven percent of the administrative villages in the Fourth Special District were affected, with Xingtang being the most severely impacted. Hailstones were as large as human heads or as small as fists. It is estimated that production in affected areas of the entire district will be reduced by 20%, with some villages in Xingtang and Zhengding experiencing reductions of 40% to 50%. In the Fifth Special District, hail damage was relatively light in Mancheng. Wangdu experienced a reduction in wheat production of about one-third due to hail. The remaining counties each experienced a reduction in yield of 20% to 30% in the affected villages, with some villages experiencing as much as 40% to 50% reduction. In the Sixth Special District, 214,400 *mu* were affected in Yuxian, Zhuolu, Xuanhua, Tianzhen, and Yangyuan, resulting in a production decrease of more than 10%.\n\nWind: On June 30th, sixteen villages in the Fourth District of Wanping, and parts of the Second, Sixth, and Seventh Districts, thirteen villages in the Fourth District of Fanshi and the Sixth District of Hunyuan were hit by windstorms. On June 20th, the Sixth and Seventh Districts of Laishui and the Fifth District of Liangxiang, and on May 6th, the Sixth District of Wanxian also experienced windstorms. In the sixteen villages of the Fourth District of Wanping alone, 2,982 *mu* of corn and 1,240 *mu* of millet were damaged, along with 10 *mu* of special crops. In the Fourth District of Laishui, 1,528 *mu* of corn and 742 *mu* of millet were damaged. In Fanshi, half of the fruit trees on the mountains were blown down, and between 20% and 60% of special crops were destroyed. More than half of the pears and peaches in western Pingxi, and the apples and pears in Yixian, were blown down.\n\nFlood: From July 19th to 22nd, continuous rain fell for four days and four nights, causing flooding in the Fourth Special District and parts of other special districts. According to statistics, in Xingtang, Fourth Special District, more than 25,000 *mu* of land were washed away or buried by sand, more than 22,000 houses collapsed, more than 11,000 pieces of farm equipment were damaged, and 382 head of livestock were killed or injured (mostly pigs). In Fuping, 5,959 *mu* of paddy fields, 464 *mu* of dry land, and 1,250 *mu* of bottomland were destroyed, along with 26,491 trees. Eight hundred and five houses collapsed. In Pingshan, the banks of the Tuo River eroded sixteen *qing* of land, and water accumulated to a depth of one to three feet in low-lying areas along the river, which had not receded by the 25th. In Jianping, ten thousand *mu* of terraced fields and thirteen thousand *mu* of bottomland were washed away. In Lingshou, nine *qing* of land were washed away. In Dongwanglou, Pingshan, black spots appeared on the stems and leaves of cotton plants after the rain, and more than one *qing* died after being exposed to the sun (the cause is still unclear). In total, 193,849 *mu* of crops were washed away, buried by sand, or drowned throughout the region, accounting for nearly 1% of the region's total cultivated land area. By special district, the Fourth Special District accounted for slightly more than 2.5% of the district's total cultivated land area, the First Special District 2.7%, and the Sixth Special District (Yuxian and Zhuolu) 3.4% of the two counties' total cultivated land area.\n\nInsect Infestation: Since the beginning of spring, various insect infestations have occurred successively, with different crops affected at different times. Although leaders at all levels have paid close attention to eradicating insect pests, some areas have experienced reduced yields due to inadequate organization, late detection, limited technical conditions, and superstitious beliefs among the masses. For example, the jujube weevil was not effectively controlled in Fuping, Quyang, and Xingtang, and the drought during the flowering season further reduced the yield. It is estimated that the total jujube production in the region will be reduced by one-third compared to normal years, with Xingtang being even worse. Armyworms have occurred successively in Yixian, Mancheng, Xushui, Tangxian, and Wanxian in the Fifth Special District; the first and eighth districts of Lingqiu, the second, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Fanshi in the First Special District; fifteen villages including Dawangcheng in Yuxian in the Sixth Special District; and the first and fourth districts of Jingxing in the Fourth Special District. In Chuanfang in the first district of Pingshan, Zhufang in the second district, and Zhuhao in the sixth district, oil shortages have occurred successively in the bottomlands, with the area affected by oil leaks in Zhuyongfang and Zhufang reaching six to seven *qing*. Woodborer damage is very serious in the border areas of Huailai, affecting income by 70% to 80%.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 根据农情初步估计　北岳可获七成年景\n\n1948-09-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　根据农情初步估计\n  　北岳可获七成年景\n    【北岳电】北岳行署顷根据各地调查材料，对全一年成作出初步估计。以抗战以来的一般常年产量为标准，预计一专区（广灵、灵邱、繁峙、应县、阳高、大同、浑源）八成，三专区（良水、房山、涞涿、宛平、良乡、昌宛、怀来）七成，四专区（灵寿、平山、阜平、曲阳、行唐、正定、建屏、井陉、获鹿）六成，五专区（唐县、完县、望都、满城、易县、徐水、定与、涞源）七成，六专区（涿鹿、蔚县、宣化、天镇、阳原、怀仁）八成。全区未被灾地区庄稼长的还不坏。因此全区总的估计为七成年景。估计的根据如下：\n    春耕开始时，雨水调匀，战争动员对生产也影响不大，这是奠定今年收成的有利方面。但去秋耕地极少，积肥不及常年的半数，又加入夏以来局部地区旱、雹、风、水、虫灾相继发生，故对收成均有或多或少的影响。\n    旱灾：自六月初落雨后，直到七月二十日的四十多天中，大部地区（六专区曾落过，其他专区亦零星落雨）没有下雨，境内河水低落，渠道水量不足，四专区有的地方甚至井水枯干，小麦一般收成每亩仅七、八市斗多（常年产量一石左右）。平山、井陉沿路禾苗有旱死三分之二以上的，建屏洪子店树叶有旱落了的，灵邱七区旱死豌豆五千四百三十一亩，三专区沙地庄稼苗也有枯死现象。估计因旱减收要在一成至二成，以四专区为最严重。\n    雹灾：六月份前后，一专遭受三次雹灾，灾区遍及全专各县，受灾村庄占全专行政村的百分之十二，受灾面积仅大同、浑源、灵邱、广灵四县不完全统计，即达二五六零零亩。三专仅怀来二区两个村统计，被毁禾苗即达七顷以上。四专有百分之十一的行政村受灾，尤以行唐最为严重，雹大如人头，小如拳头，全专区被灾地区估计减产占二成，行唐正定部分村庄有减产四成至五成者。五专除满城雹灾较轻，望都因雹灾小麦减产约三分之一，其余各县灾村均减产二三成，少数村庄竟达四五成。六专蔚、涿、宣、天镇、阳原等五县二一四四零零亩受灾，减产十分之一以上。\n    风灾：六月三十日，浑源六区，繁峙四区十三村，二、六、七区一部，宛平四区十六村刮风成灾，六月二十日涞水六、七区，良乡五区及五月六日完县六区亦相继发生风灾。仅宛平四区十六村玉茭刮坏二九八二亩，谷一二四○亩，特种作物十亩。涞水四区刮坏玉茭一五二八亩，谷七四二亩。繁峙山上果木刮掉半数，特种作物折毁百分之二三十到六十不等。平西梨、桃，易县苹果、梨等刮掉半数以上。\n    水灾：七月十九日至二十二日，阴雨连绵四天四夜，四专及他专区部分村庄均遭水灾。据统计四专行唐冲毁、沙压土地两万五千多亩，倒塌房屋两万二千多间，砸农具一万一千多件，死伤牲畜三百八十二头（猪占多数）。阜平毁水地五九五九亩，旱地四六四亩，滩地一二五○亩，树木二六四九一棵，倒房屋八○五间。平山的沱河岸冲地十六顷，沿河洼地停水一尺至三尺，至二十五日尚未撤尽。建屏冲梯田万亩，滩地一万三千亩。灵寿冲地九顷，平山东望楼雨后棉茎叶上起黑色斑点，日晒后枯死顷余（原因仍未弄清）。总计全区冲毁、砂压、涝死庄稼共计一九三八四九亩，占全区总耕地面积近百分之一。按专区说，四专占全专总耕地面积百分之二点五强，一专百分之二点七，六专蔚、涿两县被毁土地占该两县总耕地面积百分之三点四。\n    虫灾：入春以来，随着季节的推移，各种作物的不同虫灾相继发生。各级领导在扑灭虫害上虽都高度注意，但有些地方由于具体的组织工作没有赶上，有些地方发现较晚，加以技术条件限制及群众迷信思想等仍将减收。如阜平、曲阳、行唐等地的枣步曲没有打好，开花时又遇天旱，估计全区枣的产量将较常年减少三分之一，行唐更加差。五专易、满、徐、唐、完，一专灵邱一、八区、繁峙二、五、六、七区，六专蔚县大王城等十五个村，四专井陉一、四区，均先后发生黏虫。平山一区川坊，二区朱坊，六区朱毫等滩地相继发生油缺，朱用坊、朱坊二村油龙面积即有六七顷之多。怀来边缘地区的木被虫害十分严重，影响收入十分之七八。"

    "content": "【Taihang News】In order to prepare for this winter's production and support the masses' autumn harvest and wheat planting, Lincheng convened a county-wide meeting of village and district cooperative directors on the 7th of last month. The meeting revealed that, with the exception of a few cooperatives that were relatively well-run (such as Fangnao), most villages were in a state of stagnation or collapse. The main reasons for this were unclear business directions, failure to cater to the needs of the masses, failure to support mass production, and a focus on mere profit. In addition, many village cooperatives sold goods to members at excessively low prices, and with a one-sided pro-poor peasant/hired laborer viewpoint and a paternalistic approach, extended large amounts of credit to take care of the interests of poor peasants, leading many village cooperatives to a standstill. In response to these reasons, the meeting studied rectification methods and clarified business directions. After the meeting, all villages actively carried out rectification. In the space of ten days, twenty-four villages have achieved preliminary results: First, clearing outstanding debts. According to statistics from Wangjiazhuang, Chengyang and other twelve villages, a total of 2.16 million yuan was owed, of which 1.68 million yuan has been recovered, accounting for 77.7% of the total outstanding debts. The recovery process is now being carried out universally. Another aspect is the re-election of cadres and the resolution of compensation issues. For example, Zilizhuang decided that cadres working in the cooperative, in addition to fulfilling the corvée labor required of each able-bodied person in the village, would have the cooperative pay wages to hire people to do the work for the extra labor days, while the cadres themselves would be responsible for their own meals. The cooperative would distribute profits according to an 80/20 split. When the iron factory in Zhangjiazhen was established, it did not consult with the masses, and the compensation issues for workers were not well resolved. Workers lacked motivation, and the factory collapsed in February of this year. Rectification has now been carried out, the leadership has made self-criticisms, accounts have been settled and announced, and a new manager has been re-elected, and workers' compensation has been stipulated. The factory has opened the furnace twice in half a month, doubling the previous rate of twice a month. The masses reflected: \"This time it's sure to be better than last time, the manager is an expert!\" There are plans to purchase large quantities of pig iron and open more furnaces. The Shilou Village cooperative bought a tree and plans to organize transportation. Chengyang plans to buy cotton carding bows. Wangjiazhuang plans to purchase cotton, preparing to support mass winter weaving and solve raw material difficulties. However, this is only the beginning of the rectification. There are still pressing problems to be solved: such as cooperative cadres holding too many concurrent positions, affecting their concentration on business. The compensation issue for cadres has not yet been adequately resolved in some villages. Some cooperative directors reflect: \"Other work is easy to talk about and easy to handle, but it's not easy to raise the issue of cadre compensation, for fear that the masses will say we're greedy.\" Currently, all parts of the county are continuing to rectify, further discovering and solving problems, so that cooperatives can be universally restored and developed, laying the foundation for winter production.\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Lincheng Joint Office)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 清理外欠改选干部　临城各村积极整顿合作社\n\n1948-09-20\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　清理外欠改选干部\n  　临城各村积极整顿合作社\n    【太行讯】为了有准备的开展今年冬季生产和扶植群众秋收种麦，临城曾于上月七日召开全县村区合作社长会议。会上了解，除一部分合作社办的比较好（如方垴）外，大部村庄陷于停顿与垮台的状态。其原因主要是业务方向不明确，不根据群众需要，不扶植群众生产，单纯营利。还有不少村社，过低价卖给社员东西，再加上片面贫雇观点和恩赐观点，为照顾贫农利益，大量赊欠，许多村社因而停顿。会上针对这些原因，研究了整顿的办法，明确了业务方向。会后各村都在积极进行整顿。十余天的时间，有二十四个村已获得初步成绩：首先是清理欠帐，据王家庄、城阳等十二村统计，共欠款二百一十六万元，已收回一百六十八万元。占全部外欠百分之七十七点七，现正普遍清理中。另外是重新改选了干部，解决了待遇问题。如自立庄决定在社工作干部，除顶全村每个劳力应出的差役外，超过的工数，社里出工资给雇人干活，本人管饭。社里赚了钱按二八分红。张家镇的铁工厂成立时没有和群众商量，对工人待遇问题未很好解决，工人没劲干，今年二月垮了台，现已进行整顿，领导上作了检讨，结算与公布了帐目，重新选了新经理，规定了工人待遇。开门半月就开了两次炉，比过去每月两次增加了一倍。群众反映：“这次准比上次干的好，经理是内行！”现计划大批收买生铁，更多开炉。石楼村社买树一部，准备组织运输。城阳计划买弹花弓。王家庄计划收买棉花，准备扶植群众冬季纺织，解决原料困难。但这仅是整顿的开始，目前仍存在着急待解决的问题：如合作社干部兼职太多，影响专心业务。干部的待遇问题，仍有部分村未得到适当解决。有的社长反映：“旁的工作都好说，也好办，就是干部待遇不好提，怕群众说财迷。”现全县各地，正继续整顿，进一步发现与解决问题，使合作社普遍的恢复发展起来，打下冬季生产的基础。\n    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（临城联合办公室）"

More than a thousand starving people in Xinning County stormed the county government to petition on July 26th and 27th. The puppet county magistrate ordered the county police to carry out a large-scale massacre, resulting in the tragic deaths of several starving people and widespread chaos in the city. Shops and schools, moved by righteous indignation, went on strike in unison to protest the puppet government's atrocities. On the 28th, hundreds of starving people again broke into the county government. The puppet county magistrate, intimidated by the power of the masses, led the police with guns and retreated to the suburbs, where the two sides faced off for several days. Similar movements have erupted in the neighboring counties of Chengbu and Wugang: On July 22nd, thousands of starving people in Chengbu, carrying baskets and bamboo crates, rushed into the puppet county government hall to demand food from the county magistrate. The puppet police opened fire to intimidate them, but the starving people did not retreat. Only when the puppet county magistrate agreed to sell the grain levy at a public price did the masses withdraw. The people of Wugang also surrounded the county government due to famine.

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 15th. Zhang Hongquan and Yue Hongxiu, carpenters and mechanics in the Boshan West River Mining Area of Shandong, gave play to their creativity and successfully installed a new water bucket car, which increased the drainage of the mine's No. 3 well by nearly three times and saved 60% of labor. The West River Mine has the largest water flow among the mines in the area, with a normal daily water inflow of 3,500 tons. The mine regularly drains water from five wells, with only one well used for coal mining. Among them, No. 3 well, due to poor well construction, could only use leather buckets to draw water. However, the leather buckets could not be equipped with automatic water gates. Therefore, when the bucket reached the wellhead, four workers had to use long hooks to knock the bucket over onto the water pan to release the water. Draining one bucket took two minutes, its capacity was only 0.8 tons, and it could only drain more than 570 tons in a day and night.\n\nAfter the recovery of West River, mine officials organized mechanical and electrical workers to study improvement methods. Zhang Hongquan and Yue Hongxiu got together to actively research after work, often until late at night. By early May, they finally developed a new water bucket car. The new water bucket car has rails laid on the left and right sides of the wellhead. The water bucket cars are placed on both sides, with the left car connected to the left bucket and the right car connected to the right bucket (the well drains water with two buckets). The bucket mouths of both cars face the water pan, and the bottom plates of the water bucket cars also slope towards the water pan, so the water automatically flows out when the bucket lands on the car. After researching this method, they drew a diagram and requested the machinery and equipment section to manufacture the car rails. This caused a lot of discussion at the time. Some people said, \"This is simply too much trouble. We have never encountered this even in a large mine.\" Yue Hongxiu later told reporters, \"I felt half-hearted at the time, fearing that if it wasn't successful, the labor and materials would be wasted.\" However, the mine quickly approved their plan and explained, \"In order to encourage research and creation, even if some labor and materials are wasted, it is worth it.\"\n\nIn mid-May, the new water bucket car was installed, but when it was tested, the water would not flow out, mainly because the slope of the bottom of the water bucket car was not steep enough. Zhang Hongquan was very anxious and immediately re-nailed the bottom of the car. It was raining at the time, and his pants were completely soaked. However, after re-nailing the bottom of the car, the results of the first hour of testing proved to be completely successful. Compared to the past, the time for draining one bucket has been reduced from two minutes to one minute and ten-sevenths of a second. In the past, ten water-scooping workers, including the foreman, were needed day and night, but now four people (divided into two shifts, twelve hours per shift) can do it very easily. And the capacity of the leather bucket, because it no longer relies on manpower to overturn the bucket, has increased from 0.8 to 1.5 tons. More than 2,000 tons of water can be drained in a day and night.\n\nWhen Yue Hongxiu talked to reporters about the success of this research, he said, \"In my opinion, the credit mainly goes to the higher authorities. During the Han Fuju era, the Japanese occupation era, and the Kuomintang occupation era, we were all here. At that time, how much were the workers worth? Not to mention creation, no one believed that workers could do research. Now the higher authorities are constantly calling on workers to conduct research and creation. To be honest, if the higher authorities hadn't repeatedly said that they weren't afraid of wasting labor and materials, I wouldn't have dared to do it.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 积极研究发挥创造性　博山矿区工人张鸿泉岳鸿庥  装制新水车斗成功  排水量提高三倍节省人力百分之六十\n\n1948-09-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　积极研究发挥创造性\n  　博山矿区工人张鸿泉岳鸿庥\n    装制新水车斗成功\n    排水量提高三倍节省人力百分之六十\n    【新华社华东十五日电】山东博山西河矿区木工张鸿泉、机务工岳鸿庥发挥创造性，装制新水斗车成功，使该矿三号井排水量提高近三倍，且节省人力百分之六十。西河矿井在该地各矿区中水势最大，平时每日涌水三千五百吨，矿内经常以五个井排水，仅以一个井采煤。其中三号井因井筒建设欠佳，只能用牛皮罐打水；但皮罐不能装置自动水门，因此罐到井口，必须有四个工人以长钩把罐打倒水簸箕上，始能放水，排水一罐需时两分钟，其容量只有零点八吨，一昼夜只能排水五百七十余吨。\n    西河收复后，矿区公务员即组织机电工人研究改善办法。张鸿泉和岳鸿庥两人，在下班后，就凑到一起积极研究，常常直到深夜。到五月初，他们终于研究出了新水斗车。新水斗车是在井口左右两边铺设铁轨，水斗车分置两边，左车接左罐，右车接右罐（该井以两水罐排水），两车的水斗口都朝水簸箕，水斗车的底板亦向水簸箕倾斜，罐落车上水即自动流出。他们研究出这一办法后，就画出图，请求交机务股制造车轨。当时曾引起许多议论。有人说：“这简直是多费事，我们在某大矿井时也未遇见过。”岳鸿庥后来向记者说：“当时我心里冷了半截，深怕万一不成功，又白搭了工料。”但矿方迅速批准了他们的计划，并说明：“为了鼓励研究创造，即使白搭一部分工料也在所不惜。”\n    五月中旬，新水斗车装置起来了，但一试用，水流不出来，主要是水斗车的底斜度不够。张鸿泉非常着急，立即又重钉车底。当时正下雨，他的裤子全湿透了。但重钉车底后，第一小时试验结果，证明完全成功。比较过去，排水一罐由二分钟减至一分又十分之七秒；过去连领班一昼夜需十个捋水工人，现在有四个人（分两班，每班十二小时）就很轻快了。而皮罐容量，因不再靠人力捋罐，由零点八，增为一吨半。一昼夜可排水二千吨以上。\n    岳鸿庥向记者谈起这次研究成功时说：“依我说，功劳主要是上级的。韩复渠时代，日寇侵占时代，国民党侵占时代，我们也都在这里，那时工人值几个钱，别说创造，谁也不信工人能研究。现在上级却时时刻刻号召工人进行研究和创造，说实在的，要不是上级口口声声说不怕白搭工料，我早不敢去弄了。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The Kuomintang reactionary government is further plundering the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas through two measures: \"clearing\" old puppet legal tender public bonds and exchanging old foreign currency public bonds for newly issued so-called \"consolidated public bonds.\" The \"Measures for Handling Legal Tender Public Bonds,\" passed and promulgated by the Kuomintang Executive Yuan on the 4th of this month, stipulate that the \"cleared\" legal tender public bonds include seventeen types of bonds issued from 1928 to 1944. These were all issued by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to make up for its fiscal deficits and increase the wealth of the four major families. A large portion of these public bonds has not yet been repaid. According to a dispatch from the Associated Press in Nanjing on the 6th, citing Kuomintang official disclosures, this figure is 6 billion yuan. The Kuomintang government's current \"clearing\" method is to try its best to suppress the repayment multiple, making it far behind the current multiple of price increases, so that the people's assets are greatly devalued, almost equivalent to confiscation. For example, the \"clearing\" multiple for five types of public bonds, such as the 1936 Unified Public Bond, is stipulated as 27,000 times, but since 1936, prices in the Kuomintang area have risen at least 7 million times (according to the Central News Agency's figure on the 8th of this month). In reality, this devalues the capital used by the people to purchase these public bonds to less than one two hundred and sixtieth. In 1936, ordinary people took ten yuan to buy public bonds, and at that time, these ten yuan could buy one dan of rice. Now, according to the Kuomintang's \"clearing\" multiple, they can exchange for 270,000 \"legal tender\" (that is, 9 cents of counterfeit gold yuan), but they can only buy four or five silver yuan-sized small baked cakes. Under this \"clearing\" method, the public bonds held by the people become waste paper.\n\nAs for the step of issuing new so-called \"consolidated public bonds\" to exchange for foreign currency public bonds, it is part of a whole set of conspiracies by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to deprive the people of their gold, silver, and foreign currency assets. According to the \"Principles for the Issuance of Consolidated Public Bonds\" passed and promulgated by the Kuomintang Executive Yuan on the 4th, the amount of this \"consolidated public bond\" to be issued is 523 million counterfeit gold yuan. The exchange targets are four types of British and American gold bonds issued from 1938 to 1944. These bonds were originally purchased by the people under the order of the Kuomintang government with gold, silver, and foreign currency, or converted from legal tender into foreign currency. The Kuomintang government had promised to repay them with cash and foreign exchange. Now, under the name of \"exchange,\" the Kuomintang government completely cancels the people's right to recover these gold, silver, and foreign currency, or to obtain repayment according to more stable foreign currency prices, and exchanges them for so-called \"consolidated public bonds\" denominated in rapidly depreciating counterfeit gold yuan paper currency. Moreover, according to the original issuance regulations, these foreign currency public bonds will soon mature and should be fully repaid. But the Kuomintang government now wants to exchange them for so-called \"consolidated public bonds,\" and the repayment date of these \"consolidated public bonds\" is postponed to five, ten, or even twenty years later. In this way, with the passage of time and the depreciation of the counterfeit gold yuan, the result of this \"consolidation,\" like the above-mentioned \"clearing,\" is that the \"consolidated public bonds\" in the hands of the people are invisibly transferred into the treasury of the four major families. This is another great plundering magic trick played by Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋匪加紧进行大掠夺　规定“清偿”“换发”旧有公债办法  使人民持有的公债票都变成废纸\n\n1948-09-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋匪加紧进行大掠夺\n  　规定“清偿”“换发”旧有公债办法     \n    使人民持有的公债票都变成废纸\n    【新华社陕北十五日电】国民党反动政府又以“清偿”旧有伪法币公债，和新发行的所谓“整理公债”换发旧有外币公债两项办法，掠夺国民党统治区人民。国民党行政院本月四日通过并公布之“法币公债处理办法”中，规定“清偿”之法币公债包括自一九二八年至一九四四年发行的十七种债券，都是过去蒋家匪帮为弥补其财政赤字和增加四大家族财富而发行者。而这些公债中的极大一部分现在尚未归还，据美联社南京六日电引国民党官方披露此项数字为六十亿元。国民党政府现在“清偿”的办法是极力压低偿还的倍数，使之远远落后于现在物价上涨的倍数，使人民这笔资产大量贬值，几乎等于没收。例如一九三六年的统一公债等五种公债“清偿”倍数规定为二万七千倍，但从一九三六年以来，国民党区物价至少已经上涨了七百万倍（据本月八日中央社数字），实际上这就是将人民用以购买这笔公债的资本贬值到二百六十分之一以下。一九三六年老百姓拿十块钱去购买公债，当时这十块钱能买一担米，现在按照国民党“清偿”倍数换到二十七万“法币”（即九分伪金圆券），却只能买到四五个银圆大的小烧饼了。人民所持有的公债票在这种“清偿”办法下就成了废纸。\n    至于发行新的所谓“整理公债”用以换发外币公债的步骤，则是蒋家匪帮剥夺人民金、银、外币资产的一整套阴谋中的一部分。此项“整理公债”之发行数额，据国民党行政院四日通过公布之“整理公债发行原则”规定，为五亿二千三百万伪金圆券。其换发对象为自一九三八年至一九四四年发行之四种英美金债票，这些债票原系人民在国民党政府命令下被迫以黄金、白银及外币等或以法币折合外币缴购，而国民党政府则曾允诺以现金、外汇清偿者，现在国民党政府则一律在“换发”名义下，根本取消了人民收回这些金、银、外币的权利，或按照较稳定的外币价格取得偿还的权利，而换为以正在迅速贬值的伪金圆券纸币为单位的所谓“整理公债”。而且按原来发行规定，这些外币公债均很快到期而应予以全部清偿。但国民党政府现在却要换以所谓“整理公债”，而这“整理公债”的清偿日期，则推延到五年、十年甚至二十年以后。这样，随着时间的推移，伪金圆券的贬值，这次“整理”的结果，象上述的“清偿”一样，人民手中的“整理公债”便无形中转入到四大家族财库中去了。这又是蒋介石玩的大掠夺魔术之一。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 14th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the new salaries for public servants stipulated by the Kuomintang reactionary government after the \"currency reform\" have caused great dissatisfaction in all quarters. According to the new regulations, the salary standards for all public servants in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, taking the Shanghai area as an example, are uniformly based on 40 yuan of the original salary converted to the new \"Gold Yuan\" currency; 20 percent is paid for the portion exceeding 40 yuan up to 300 yuan. Other regions outside of Shanghai will increase or decrease by a certain percentage from this standard. Under this new standard, a public servant with a monthly salary of 100 yuan will actually only receive 52 yuan. At the same time, due to the abolition of the cost-of-living index, continued price increases, and the inevitable devaluation of the \"Gold Yuan,\" their actual income will be far less than 52 yuan. Furthermore, public servants with a monthly salary of 100 yuan are in the minority; the suffering of the vast number of middle and lower-level public servants with monthly salaries below 100 yuan is even more unbearable. According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on August 29th, the professors' associations of national colleges and universities in Nanjing held a joint meeting on the 29th, attended by more than 20 professor representatives from universities such as Central University, Drama Academy, and Conservatory of Music. They unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the new salary standard for public servants, pointing out that this treatment \"is not only vastly different from pre-war treatment, but it is also difficult to maintain even a minimum standard of living.\" Even the pseudo-legislators generally \"expressed dissatisfaction\" with the \"meager treatment\" given to public servants this time, believing that \"this treatment is less than 20 percent of the pre-war salaries of public servants\" (Associated Press, Nanjing, August 28th). However, the ruthless Chiang Kai-shek, in his speech at the enlarged memorial week meeting in Nanjing on the 6th of this month, asked the public servants who were already starving to \"grit their teeth and tighten their belts,\" and told them to \"do the work of two people with one person, and eat the food of one person with two people\" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th). This precisely exposes the essence of the \"starvation policy\" implemented by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. Only the calculations of the rogue Chiang Kai-shek, who came from a stock exchange \"scalper\" background, could be so harsh and cruel.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋家匪帮推行“饥饿政策”　公教人员待遇更低引起各方极大不满\n\n1948-09-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋家匪帮推行“饥饿政策”\n  　公教人员待遇更低引起各方极大不满\n    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合各方消息：国民党反动政府于“币改”后所规定的公教人员的新待遇，已引起各方极大不满。按照新规定，国民党统治区一切公教人员的薪资标准，以京沪区为例，一律以原薪改订四十元为基数，实发伪金元券；超过四十元至三百元之部分，按百分之二十发给。京沪以外各地区，则以此标准分别增减若干成。在这新标准下，一个月薪一百元的公教人员，其实际收入只有五十二元，同时又因生活指数的取消，物价继续上涨和伪金元的必然贬值，其实际收入将远不足五十二元，且月薪一百元的公教人员乃属少数，其余月薪一百元以下的广大中下级公教人员，其苦更不堪言。据中央社南京八月二十九日消息，南京国立各专科以上学校教授会，于二十九日召开联席会议，到有中大、剧专、音乐学院等各校教授代表二十多人，对于公教人员待遇新标准，一致表示不满，并指出这一待遇“不但与战前待遇相差极巨，即维持最低限度之生活亦属不易”。甚至伪立法委员们，也一般都对这次给予公教人员的“低微待遇”“表示不满”，认为“这一待遇，不及战前公教人员薪水的百分之二十”（合众社南京八月二十八日电）。但心狠手辣的蒋介石，却在本月六日南京扩大纪念周会讲话中，要求早已陷入饥饿中的公教人员“咬紧牙关，抽紧肚带”，并要他们“一个人做两个人的事，两个人吃一个人的饭”（中央社南京六日电）。这正是一语道破蒋介石反动集团所推行的“饥饿政策”的实质。这也只有交易所做“抢帽子”出身的流氓蒋介石的算盘，才能打得如此刻薄残忍。"

    "title": "What is the Purpose of Compensating Middle Peasants Wrongly Struggled Against?",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-20",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Column: Inquiry and Reply\n\n　　Compensating Middle Peasants Wrongly Struggled Against:\n　　What exactly is the purpose?\n　　Comrade Editor:\n　　I have several questions to ask for clarification.\n　　1. One of the three generations employed a long-term farmhand. The family's living standard declined in 1933 (owning 1.1 mu of farmland and renting 1.5 mu, relying on weaving for a living), and there was no longer any exploitation. In 1944, the daughter-in-law inherited a piece of land from her maiden home, and the family's living standard rose. Now there are six people in the family, cultivating 5.8 mu of paddy field, 2.9 mu of river beach land, and 2 mu of dry hillside land, totaling 10.7 mu, which is cultivated through hired labor (the family has no labor force; there are three men, two of whom went out to participate in revolutionary work after the incident, leaving only a four-year-old boy at home, and three women, one 56 years old, one 32, and one 11). The family only does light work such as planting vegetables, weeding, and watering. What is their class status? Should they be considered a wealthy middle peasant, an ordinary middle peasant, or a poor peasant? Also, should the feudal remnants of exploiting long-term farmhands (1.1 mu of land) from the family's three generations be considered feudal roots and confiscated?\n　　2. When determining class status based on three generations, they were initially classified as landlords and rich peasants but were changed to middle peasants during the rectification of policies. To protect the interests of the middle peasants, wrongly confiscated items should be returned. However, some items have already been borrowed by the poor peasant committee and the work team or distributed to the peasants, making it difficult to return them. Or the items distributed to the peasants have already been damaged. What should be done? Currently, most of the items are still stored in the warehouse and have not been distributed. Would it be acceptable to return 65% of the confiscated items and classify the remaining as feudal roots and not return them? Is giving these things to wrongly classified households to take care of their production, or to not infringe on the interests of the middle peasants? Can it be said that it is the \"leniency\" of the poor peasant leagues and the poor towards wrongly classified households, to carry out unity?\n　　3. After the policy is rectified, the class status determined by the poor peasant committee and the land reform work team after discussion is not agreed to by the classified household. Is it correct to ask the district committee to approve the execution? If the wrongly classified household keeps raising opinions to the work team during the reclassification of class status, affecting the work, can they be suppressed? Is it considered a counterattack?\n　　4. One household was classified as landlords when investigating three generations and was completely evicted. Now they have been reclassified as middle peasants. One member of the family has been working outside since the incident and returned home last winter for medical treatment due to illness. When the family was evicted, his personal belongings, medicines, bedding, clothes, shoes, socks, mosquito nets, pens, and books were all confiscated. Now they want to be returned, but some of them have been borrowed or distributed to the peasants and have been used up or damaged, making it difficult to return them. How should this be handled? Also, the Certificate of Glorious Sacrifice issued by the government after another man in the family died in battle was also confiscated and lost during the eviction last year. Now his family members are demanding its return. What should be done?\n　　5. From when to when should things be returned to middle and poor peasants who were wrongly classified? What should be done if things are lost (such as due to rain) during the return period? Also, the wheat fields of the wrongly classified households that were confiscated this year were cultivated by the original owners, and the newly assigned households have harvested them and planted autumn crops. Should the wrongly classified middle peasants be returned the wheat? Also, the wrongly classified households have more good land and less bad land, but the total mu and output per capita are all below the average middle peasant level. Now that their good land has been confiscated, they do not want land from other families. After the class status is reclassified, should the land still be returned to them? Also, if the poor peasant league's accounts do not have a record of something being returned to a wrongly classified household, but the wrongly classified household says it exists and has proof from a person who participated in the confiscation that it was indeed taken, can it be returned? If there is proof that it was confiscated, but it cannot be found in the warehouse, what should be done?\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Qingshan, Tianxing Township, Second District, Pingshan\n\n　　Answer: The purpose of land reform is to eliminate feudal and semi-feudal exploitation, liberate the productive forces, and develop production, not other things. Therefore, all issues in land reform should start from this principle. Why should we consolidate and unite with the middle peasants? Because the middle peasants are laborers and producers. Protecting the middle peasants means protecting the productive forces. Infringing upon the middle peasants means destroying the productive forces. In the process of new democratic economic construction, from the individual economy to the collective cooperative economy, we mainly rely on the middle peasants. They have rich production experience and relatively complete production tools. We must consolidate and unite with all the middle peasants to make large-scale production successful. If we undermine the interests of the middle peasants, or even oppose them, then our slogan of \"raising agricultural production by an inch\" will fail, and even lead to the failure of the revolution. Compensating the wrongly struggled middle peasants is to achieve the goal of developing production. Consolidating and uniting with all the middle peasants is our strategic task. Therefore, it is wrong to say that compensating the middle peasants is the \"leniency\" of the poor peasant leagues towards the middle peasants. The middle peasants are our own people. If we mistakenly hurt the middle peasants, we must compensate them. If we do not compensate them, we cannot unite with the middle peasants well and achieve the goal of unity and production. (Regarding the issue of uniting the middle peasants, Comrade Ren Bishi has a brilliant explanation in his article \"Several Issues in Land Reform.\" Please pay attention to and refer to it.)\n　　Compensating the middle peasants should mobilize the poor and hired peasants and rely on them to actively discuss and resolve issues with the middle peasants in a consultative manner. On the one hand, the class status should be publicly revised, and on the other hand, compensation should be given based on the specific situation. If we do not analyze and rigidly adhere to returning the original items, this will cause unnecessary fluctuations in the countryside and affect rural unity and production. This is not the purpose of our rectification. In revising the class status, the person concerned should be involved. Anyone (regardless of class status) can raise opinions. If they disagree, they can appeal to the higher-level government for revision. Democracy should be fully promoted. The work team should not be afraid of others raising opinions. It is good to raise opinions, which can reduce mistakes. It should never be thought that someone raising questions or appeals is a counterattack and should be \"suppressed.\" That is a manifestation of not implementing policies and lacking a democratic style, which should be corrected.\n　　The specific issues raised in the letter can be easily resolved based on these principles:\n　　1. The family's male labor force participates in the revolution, and the land is cultivated by hired labor, which cannot be considered exploitation. Their class status can be determined based on their relationship to the means of production. In the past, there was feudal exploitation, leaving 1.1 mu of land, which cannot be confiscated as feudal remnants. If landlords and rich peasants whose class status has been lowered still possess a large amount of feudal property, a portion of it can be confiscated.\n　　2. Compensation should be based on the specific situation. If the items have not yet been distributed, the peasant masses should be persuaded to return the original items. If they have been distributed, all public and private efforts should be made to compensate them. We should not rigidly adhere to returning the original items.\n　　3.

The pharmaceutical industry has seen particularly significant development. Before the War of Resistance, the city had only six pharmacies, with only one or two engaging in wholesale, and the rest being small retail drugstores. During the enemy's occupation, although five or six pharmacies were added, there were no trading houses. Since liberation, especially after the implementation of correct industrial and commercial policies this year, the pharmaceutical industry has developed greatly. Now, there are forty-six pharmaceutical businesses in the city, twenty-one of which are pharmaceutical trading houses. In June, the city's average daily transaction volume of medicinal materials exceeded 20,000 catties. Qingsheng Pharmacy, which started operating last year with only seven people and a capital of two million, has seen its capital grow to 52 million this year. From February to April, it gained a net profit of 17.5 million. The number of staff has also increased to forty-two. Since appropriately resolving the wage issue, Jisheng Pharmaceutical Trading House has greatly improved the workers' enthusiasm for production, increasing output by one-third in a month compared to the original output. Previously, each worker only cut an average of fifteen catties of medicine per day, but now they cut an average of twenty-two catties per day, and the quality has also improved. To encourage everyone's enthusiasm for production, the factory voluntarily bought towels, soap, and tea for the workers as rewards. The workers also respect the factory a lot. Every time they cut medicine, they first cut some for the factory to inspect the fineness before cutting the rest. They pay attention to saving when cutting medicine, and no matter how difficult it is, they always try to cut all the broken and loose medicine. The city's merchants have doubled their enthusiasm for business.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 邯郸药材等业增加\n\n1948-09-20\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　邯郸药材等业增加\n    【冀南电】自端正工商业政策后，七月份邯郸市增加卷烟业、作坊业、铁工业、棉织业等工业廿七家，杂货业、货栈业、煤炭业、中药业、油业、棉业等商业五十四家。药材业更有显著发展。该市抗战前只有六家药店，除一、二家批发外，其余都是些零售小药铺。在敌人统治时，药材业虽增加了五、六家，但没有行栈。自解放后，特别是今年端正了工商业政策后，药材业有了很大发展。现在全市共有药业四十六家，其中有廿一家是药材行栈。六月份全市每天平均成交药材两万多斤。庆生药行去年开始经营时只七个人，二百万资金，今年资金已发展到五千二百万元，二月到四月，共得纯利一千七百五十万元。柜上人员也添到四十二人。济生药材行自从适当解决了工资问题后，大大提高了工人生产情绪，一个月内比原先产量增加三分之一。以前平均每个工人一天只切十五斤药，现在每天平均切二十二斤，在质量上也提高了。厂方为了鼓励大家生产情绪，自动给工人买毛巾、肥皂、茶叶作为奖励，工人对厂方也很尊重，每次切药时，先切出一些叫厂方检验粗细，然后再切。切药时注意节约，所有碎药零药不管怎样费劲，也总要切到里边去。该市商人经营情绪加倍提高。"

In Wuyuan Village, the second district of Yushe, Village Head Comrade Zhou Shengrong has always been actively responsible for his work and is very enthusiastic about education. He always participates in the Xuanwei Committee meetings to jointly study propaganda and education work. Whenever he has time, he visits the school to see what difficulties the teachers have and what they need. He persuades the children not to be playful and to study hard. He often says, \"No matter what work is done, it cannot be separated from propaganda and education.\" Dazhao Village in the seventh district of Pingshun is a scattered village, forty li around, making it difficult for all children to attend school. More than 70 percent of the school-age children in the village are herding cattle. In Qingnan Village, the second district of Licheng, no children enrolled when school started this time. After several parent meetings, they unanimously said, \"The children only fight and don't learn to read at school, so it's better for them to do some work at home.\" The teacher made a self-criticism on the spot. However, the number of enrolled children was still small. The teacher consulted with Zhao Shusheng, the chairman of the Farmers' Association. Zhao said, \"If you can guarantee that the children will learn to read, I guarantee that I will persuade the parents to send their children to school.\" That day, he immediately mobilized door-to-door. Li Shiyun often said that the school was a grazing field, and that children could not learn a single word, so he would not let his children go to school. Comrade Zhao Shusheng repeatedly persuaded and mobilized him, using the principle that not being able to read would cause great losses, and he got through to him. He personally sent his daughter to school and made many suggestions to the school, \"Children should be taught more abacus and daily-use writing, and should not be beaten or scolded randomly.\" Zhao Tuhai, who was fifteen years old, played at home every day and did not go to school. Zhao Shusheng took the time to talk to him every day, not afraid of trouble, and persuaded him in every way. He also mobilized his parents, and finally convinced him. Zhao Tuhai enrolled in school and studied very actively. The village elementary school has gradually become standardized. Shi Yusheng, the education director of Baojiajiao Village in the second district, and Wang Zhagen, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, are very concerned about the school. They specifically divided the work. They did not take a nap at noon and convened meetings of parents and women. Comrade Shi Yusheng used accounting methods to get through to the parents who were unwilling to let their children go to school. Wang Zhagen mobilized the women, saying, \"If women want liberation and want to have a position, one is production and the other is culture. It's so pitiful that we've been blind all our lives. If children don't study from an early age, they will blame us adults when they grow up.\" The women's thinking was cleared, and both boys and girls enrolled in school.

    "content": "Jizhong District Party Committee Directs All Levels of Party Committees\n  　Must Respect Criticism from Party Newspapers\n    [Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed all levels of Party committees to fully utilize newspapers to strengthen criticism and self-criticism. It first pointed out: Party newspapers are an important weapon for implementing the Party's policies, guiding work, and strengthening the Party's ties with the masses. Party committees and cadres at all levels must respect the criticism from newspapers and accept democratic supervision. Only in this way can they continuously improve themselves, improve their work, and strengthen the Party's ties with the masses. It then pointed out: Recently, the newspaper has published some criticisms of certain regions and departments, but those who were criticized generally adopted an attitude of ignoring them, lacking the spirit of review and self-criticism; a few even adopted an opposing, or even resistant, attitude, using distorted logic to cover up their mistakes instead of self-criticism, seemingly harboring a mentality of only allowing good news to be reported and not bad news. These are not the behaviors that a Party organization and its党员 cadres should have. In order to promote mass criticism and self-criticism, the following instructions are given: (1) Newspapers should truly become an important weapon for the people to express their opinions and supervise the bureaucracy of leading organs or certain Party members and cadres. For criticisms and suggestions in the newspaper that involve the local area or department, the local leading organ and the competent department, regardless of the source of the news and whether it is true or not, should conduct a serious inspection. After analysis and research, if the criticism is correct, supplementary materials should be provided to the Party newspaper, further self-criticism should be conducted, and the specific measures and results of correcting shortcomings and mistakes should be reported to the Party newspaper in a responsible and continuous manner; if the criticism is incorrect, the actual situation should be calmly explained. Any refusal to accept criticism or deliberate failure to respond to criticism is not allowed, otherwise, organizational criticism will be received; those who persist in their mistakes will be subject to Party disciplinary action. (2) In the future, newspapers should strengthen criticism and self-criticism. Party committees at all levels should mobilize Party members and cadres to seriously examine their work and conduct a factual and public disclosure of shortcomings and mistakes, so as to educate the whole Party and educate the masses. (3) In the future, manuscripts belonging to criticism, suggestions, and inquiries can be published without review by local leading organs. After receiving such manuscripts, the newspaper should handle them responsibly. If problems are found, they can be investigated or inquired about before publication. If the published manuscripts contain inaccuracies, the local leading organs or Party members and cadres can provide accurate materials for public defense. If the criticism is wrong, counter-criticism can be carried out. Those who deliberately distort the facts and make groundless accusations will also be subject to criticism and even punishment. However, this does not apply to those who are within the scope of understanding the issue. Criticisms on major issues should be published after being approved by the District Party Committee. If necessary, the consent of the local leading organ can be obtained before publication. If there is a major dispute over the issue, the District Party Committee can send people to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中区党委指示各级党委　必须尊重党报批评\n\n1948-09-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中区党委指示各级党委\n  　必须尊重党报批评\n    【冀中电】中共冀中区党委顷指示各级党委，充分利用报纸，加强批评与自我批评。首先指出：党报是贯彻党的政策，指导工作，加强党与群众联系的重要武器，各级党委与各部门干部，必须尊重报纸的批评，接受民主的监督。只有这样，才能不断提高自己，改进工作，密切党与群众的联系。接着指出：近来导报发表了一些对某些地区和部门的批评，但被批评者一般采取了置之不理的态度，缺乏检讨与自我批评的精神；个别的还采取了对立，甚至反抗的态度，用歪曲道理掩饰其错误来代替自我批评，似乎存有只准报喜不能报忧的精神。这都不是一个党的组织和党员干部应有的表现。为提倡群众性的批评与自我批评，指示提出：（一）报纸应真正成为人民大众发表意见，监督领导机关或某些党员干部的官僚主义的重要武器。对报纸上的批评建议，涉及本地或本部门的问题，当地领导机关及主管部门，不管消息来源，不管真实与否，应进行认真的检查，经过分析研究，批评对的，应向党报补充材料，做进一步的检讨，并将改正缺点错误的具体办法与结果向党报做负责的连续报导；批评的不对的，应冷静的说明确实情况。任何拒绝批评或对批评故意不答复，都是不允许的，否则要受组织批评；坚持错误的要受党的纪律处分。（二）今后报纸上要加强批评与自我批评，各级党委应发动党员干部，认真检查工作，对缺点错误进行实事求是的公开揭发，以便教育全党，教育群众。（三）今后属于批评建议及问事处之类稿件，可不经当地领导机关审查。报社接到此类稿件后，应作负责的处理。认为有问题时，可调查或询问后发表。已刊登之稿件，如有不真实处，当地领导机关或党员干部可提出确切材料，公开申辩。批评错了的，可进行反批评。若有故意歪曲事实，无中生有的乱批评，亦要受到批评甚至处分。但属于对问题认识范围者不在此限。有关重大问题的批评，应经区党委批准后再发表。必要时可取得当地领导机关同意后再发表。对问题如有大的争论，区党委可派人切实调查，弄清真象。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th.\n\n　　Liu Jianzhang, Director of the Yan'an Sub-district Cooperative of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, in Liulin District, Yan'an County, adopted methods such as wartime service contracting, mutual aid transportation, and the establishment of wartime service transfer stations to improve the past wartime service mobilization methods, taking into account the difficulties faced by farmers in the district regarding labor and livestock, and better completing the wartime service tasks. Farmers, with their wartime service burdens more reasonably resolved, have been relieved of concerns about feeding livestock for service, and are gradually increasing the number of livestock they raise.\n\n　　Due to the brutal destruction during the occupation by bandits, the number of livestock in the district decreased sharply by 74% compared to before the war. Due to a severe shortage of grain, most farmers went south to areas like Luochuan to trade grain to maintain their livelihoods, but due to a lack of organization and capital, they not only delayed agricultural production but also transported little grain. In the past, the district's wartime service mobilization methods involved concentrated mobilization, which wasted a lot of work time, and each donkey carried little weight. Moreover, the civilian laborers had to pay for their own fodder and food on the return journey. In order to solve the above difficulties and contradictions, Liu Jianzhang, in coordination with the district government, adopted the following three methods:\n\n　　(1) Organize long-distance contracting: The supply station converts the rice, grass, and fodder supplied to the civilian laborers into cash, which is handed over to the cooperative to organize long-distance transportation for wartime service tasks. Because the price of grain is low in the south, the cooperative organizes civilian laborers to bring back grain on the way. The results showed that the labor and livestock used were reduced, but the amount transported actually increased. For example, in the past, 500 donkeys could only carry 45,000 catties, but the first time six teams were organized for contracting, 349 donkeys carried more than 51,000 catties and completed the task ahead of schedule. As a result, the cost of supplies from the supply station was reduced by 45%. The porters moved quickly and orderly, saving 1,500 man-days and animal-days compared to the previous mobilization method due to assembly. The porters earned more than 77 shi of grain by selling the grain they brought back on their return journey, which was distributed among the porters according to their labor. In addition to using six mules from the Yan'an County Cooperative as a base, the remaining porters were farmers in the district with livestock who volunteered to participate, and their crops were cultivated through mutual labor exchange with others in the villages, with the profits from grain trading shared with them. This method combines wartime service, grain trading for relief, and agricultural production, and is deeply welcomed by the masses. To facilitate transportation, the Industrial Cooperative has invested 10 million yuan as a grain trading fund for the contracting team, and the cooperative has also sent people to the transportation locations in advance to prepare the purchase of grain, making it easier for the porters to transport it upon arrival.\n\n　　(2) Mutual aid for sideline transportation: This method combines wartime service transportation with sideline transportation and agricultural cultivation through labor exchange. This method is more flexible than long-distance transportation. In the past, spontaneous trading by the masses was characterized by a shortage of capital and meager profits. This situation was completely reversed after Liulin Village and Wangjiagou adopted this method. For example, Ai Keqin, He Zhanyuan, and Ma Haixiu from Liulin Village jointly bought donkeys to transport wartime service supplies and trade grain. One person took turns farming in the village, and they transported six times in two months, earning a net profit of 1.83 million agricultural currency and 1.3 dou of wheat. Recently, they bought two more livestock for transportation, and the crops were cultivated as usual. In Wangjiagou, 13 out of 48 households participated in transportation, making a significant profit. Those in the village who lacked capital for trading received assistance from the cooperative and private individuals. The cooperative provided 34% of the grain trading capital. After several grain transportations and contracting jobs, not only was the food shortage solved, but all the autumn fields were cultivated as usual.\n\n　　(3) Wartime service transportation station: The masses raised funds and the government provided loans to help purchase livestock, and established stations specifically for the transfer of routine, small-scale wartime service tasks. This changed the past problem of transferring goods along villages, with each village changing people and donkeys, which wasted a lot of time and affected agricultural production. In mid-June, the district set up three stations with ten livestock at key transportation routes in the district, and all routine wartime service tasks were handled by these three stations. When there were tasks, they were transferred according to the station. When there were no tasks, they were used for milling flour and transporting coal for production. If there were many wartime service tasks, the masses were temporarily mobilized for transfer, and then the stations would repay the labor. If the expenses exceeded production, the cost was borne by the people of the entire district. The results of the implementation were well-received by the masses.\n\n　　By June, the district had formed a long-distance donkey team of 111 donkeys, a short-distance cattle team of 50 cattle, 70 temporarily mutually-aided livestock, and three wartime service transportation stations. The number of livestock in each village increased daily, with more than 30 heads added in the entire district in two months.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 刘建章采用三个好办法　合理解决战勤负担\n\n1948-09-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　刘建章采用三个好办法\n  　合理解决战勤负担\n    【新华社西北十八日电】陕甘宁边区延属分区联社主任刘建章，在延安县柳林区，采用战勤包运，朋帮运输和建立战勤转运站等办法，改善过去战勤动员方式，照顾了该区农民劳畜力困难和生产，并更好的完成了战勤任务。农民以战勤负担得到较合理解决，解除了怕喂牲口支差的顾虑，日渐增喂牲口。\n    该区由于胡匪侵占期间的残酷破坏，畜力较战前锐减百分之七十四。由于粮食非常缺乏，多数农民南至洛川一带贩粮维持生活，但因缺乏组织和本钱，既耽误农业生产，又驮运不多；而该区过去战勤动员方式，动员集中既误工很多，每驴驮的重量也不大，民工在返回途中，尚须自贴草料、吃用等费。为解决以上困难和矛盾，刘建章乃协同区政府采用了以下三个办法：\n    （一）组织长脚包运：即由兵站将供给民工之米、草、料等折成现金，交给合作社组织长脚包运战勤任务；因南钱粮价低，由合作社组织民工附带贩回粮食。实行结果，所用人力、畜力减少，驮量反而增加。如过去五百头驴只能驮四万五千斤，而第一次组织六个小队包运结果，三百四十九头驴，就驮了五万一千多斤，并提早完成了任务。因而兵站供给的费用减少了百分之四十五。脚户动作迅速整齐，又比过去实行动员时，节省了因集合等而浪费的一千五百个人工和畜工。脚户回程中贩回粮食出卖，共赚粮七十七石多，由脚户按劳力分配。包运队除以延安县联社六个骡子作基础外，其余脚户由该区有牲口的农民自愿报名参加，其庄稼则在农村中自找对象变工耕种，而以贩粮所赚与之分红。这一办法使战勤、贩粮渡荒和农业生产三者结合起来，深受群众欢迎。为便利运输，现工合特投资一千万元作包运队贩粮基金，合作社亦已派人至运输地点事先筹买好粮食，便于脚户随到随运。\n    （二）朋帮副业运输：即战勤运输与副业运输、农业耕种变工结合进行。此办法比长脚运输更具机动性。过去群众自发贩运，因资本短少，利润轻微。柳林村和王家沟采用此法后即完全相反。如柳林村艾克勤、何占元和马海秀三人合伙买驴运输战勤及贩粮食，一人轮流在村种地，两月中共贩运六次，净赚农币一百八十三万元及麦子一石三斗，最近又增买两头牲口运输，庄稼则照常耕种。王家沟全村四十八户，即有十三户参加运输，获利很大。该村贩运缺乏资本者，由合作社和私人间借助。贩粮资本有百分之三十四为合作社所借。经几次运粮、包脚，不但吃粮得到解决，并使全部秋田照常耕种。\n    （三）战勤运输站：即由群众集资及政府贷款帮助购买牲口，设站专门转运日常零星战勤。改变了过去沿村转送，村村换人换驴，化费时间很多，影响农业生产的毛病。六月中旬该区以十头牲口在该区交通要道分设了三个站，一切零星战勤统由该三站负责转送。有差时即按站转送，无差时即磨面驮炭生产。如战勤繁多时，临时动员群众转运，随后由各该站还工。如开支超出生产，由全区人民负担。实行结果，群众反映很好。\n    至六月份该区已组成长脚驴一百十一头，短脚牛五十头，临时朋帮牲口七十头，战勤运输站三处。各村牲口日见增加，全区两个月间增加了三十余头。"

    "content": "Developing Secondary Education in North China\n\n　　The education sector in the North China Liberated Area has been continuously developing and innovating since the Anti-Japanese War, and has experienced even more vigorous growth in the past three years. According to recent incomplete statistics from various locations, there are 144 secondary schools scattered throughout the North China Liberated Area: including 43 middle schools established by administrative offices and municipalities/counties, 5 normal schools established by administrative offices and municipalities, 90 simplified normal schools established by counties, and 6 other vocational schools such as finance and economics schools. There are regularly 24,962 students enrolled in these schools. Specifically: 15,506 middle school students, accounting for more than half of all students; 7,128 normal school students; and 2,328 vocational school students. The distribution of these schools in various administrative offices and municipalities is as follows: The Taihang District has a total of 29 schools: 6 middle schools established by the administrative office, 2 normal schools, 1 finance and economics school, and 20 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,284 students. The Jinnan District has a total of 27 schools: 6 middle schools established by the administrative office, 3 vocational schools (agricultural school, finance and economics school, and telephone training school), and 18 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,263 students (statistics are missing from eight county normal schools). The Jizhong District has a total of 25 schools: 5 middle schools established by the administrative office, 20 simplified normal middle schools established by special commissioner's offices and counties, and some county-level higher primary schools also have attached middle school classes. There are a total of 6,369 students. The Beiyue District has a total of 22 schools: 7 middle schools established by the administrative office, 1 normal school, and 14 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,127 students. The Ji-Lu-Yu District has a total of 19 schools: 5 middle schools established by the administrative office and 14 simplified normal schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,407 students. The Taiyue District has a total of 18 schools: 6 middle schools established by the administrative office, 1 normal school, 1 political and civilian cadre school, and 10 simplified normal middle schools established by counties. There are a total of 3,637 students. Shijiazhuang City has a total of 4 schools: Municipal Middle School, Municipal Girls' Middle School, Municipal Normal School, and Construction College. There are a total of 1,875 students. In addition, the North China Central Bureau and the North China Government directly administer Yucai Middle School, with 450 students, as well as staff schools, finance and economics schools, accounting schools, and maternal and child health schools.\n\n　　In approximately three years, the number of secondary schools in the North China Liberated Area has increased fourfold compared to the Anti-Japanese War period. According to statistics before the Japanese surrender: At that time, there were a total of 34 secondary schools in the entire North China region, 26 in the original Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, and 8 in the Jin-Cha-Ji area, with 6,359 students. This was a truly remarkable achievement in the difficult environment of guerrilla warfare during the Anti-Japanese War. In the six months after the Japanese surrender and the first half of the second year, secondary schools developed rapidly. In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, the number of middle schools increased from 8 to 43, and the number of students increased from 1,655 to more than 6,000. Before the evacuation of Zhangjiakou, it further developed to 56 schools, with 10,350 students. The number of schools in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area also increased from 26 to 50. Due to the large influx of students into schools in various locations, the number of student classes in each school generally increased. For example, in the first half of 1946 in Taihang, the number of middle schools rapidly increased from 9 to 14, the number of classes from 35 to 61, and the number of students from 1,309 to 2,674. By the end of 1946, it had further increased to 71 classes with 3,500 students. In 1947, in order to meet the demand for teachers caused by the universal development of national education in various locations, Taihang County established 20 simplified normal schools with a total of 37 classes, training 1,480 teachers. In other areas such as Jinnan, Taiyue, and Ji-Lu-Yu, secondary schools also experienced rapid development in a short period.\n\n　　After the Japanese surrender, the vigorous development of secondary schools in the North China Liberated Area was due, on the one hand, to the adaptation of educational workers in various locations to the new situation, making every effort to expand and establish new schools. On the other hand, it was due to our correct implementation of policies towards intellectuals in the newly recovered cities, which allowed us to quickly restore the schools we took over. For example, after Jin-Cha-Ji recovered Zhangjiakou and other cities, middle schools quickly reopened. After Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu recovered Jining, schools such as the No. 7 Middle School in the city, Jining Normal School, and Girls' Middle School were quickly restored. Even pre-war schools that had collapsed during the Anti-Japanese War, such as Juancheng Normal School, Yuncheng Normal School, Ningyang Middle School, Shouzhang Normal School, Yanggu Middle School, and Qingfeng Normal School, were re-established by the democratic government at this time. Many of the original teachers from these schools, as well as intellectuals who had lived in seclusion in the countryside during the Anti-Japanese War, participated in the educational work of the new schools. In Taihang, after our army liberated Xingtai, Jiaozuo, Boai, and other places, the majority of the original teachers from the local secondary schools remained in their original schools to teach, and the number of new students who had just been liberated from the long-term rule of the enemy reached 1,019 in 1945. The situation in other areas was generally the same.\n\n　　During the intense two years of the People's Liberation War, secondary schools in North China persisted in their work under various difficult conditions, training 36,168 students. These are the achievements of the efforts of educational workers and are worthy of commendation. However, due to changes in the situation, unclear leadership guidelines, lack of systems and plans, and failure to establish certain systems in a timely manner, secondary education could not fully adapt to the needs of the war and construction. In addition, during the land reform and party rectification, the mistake of transplanting the methods of rural struggle to schools once created a state of chaos in the schools. These greatly affected the due achievements of secondary education. In particular, last winter, many teachers and students suffered undue blows and purges simply because of their family background or certain shortcomings in their style of work. This was a serious loss. This error has begun to be corrected in some areas since this spring. The situation has now changed. Taiyue wrote letters to the purged teachers and students, and Jizhong assigned special personnel to go down to correct the errors. Other regions have all carried out deviations, and considerable results have been achieved. The purged teachers and students have gradually returned to school, and most of those who have not returned have also participated in work. Since the beginning of summer, various regions have convened middle school conferences to study educational guidelines, correct educational policies, and continue to implement deviation corrections. Middle schools in various places are showing a new atmosphere. In Jinnan, there were only more than 800 students in six middle schools this spring, but after correcting deviations, the number has now increased to 1,548.\n\n　　This North China Secondary Education Conference has further clearly defined the future direction of secondary education, formulated school systems and courses, unified thinking, and the secondary education cause in the North China Liberated Area will surely make brilliant achievements on the existing basis.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 发展中的华北中等教育\n\n1948-09-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　发展中的华北中等教育\n    华北解放区的教育事业，从抗日战争时期，就在不断建设并有许多创造，三年以来，更有蓬勃的发展。据最近各地不完全的统计，散布在华北解放区各地的中等学校，有一四四处：其中行署与市县立中学四十三处，行署与市立师范五处，县立简师九○处，其他职业学校如财经学校等六处。经常在校学习的学生，有二四九六二名。计：中学生一五五○六人，占全部学生二分之一强。师范生七一二八人，职业学校学生二三二八人。这些学校在各行署市分布的情形如下：太行区共二十九处。行署立中学六处，师范二处，财经学校一处，县立简师二○处。学生共三二八四人。冀南区共二十七处。行署立中学六处，职业学校（农校，财经学校及电话训练学校）三处，县立简师十八处。学生共三二六三人（缺八个县师统计）。冀中区共二十五处。行署立中学五处，专署与县立简师中学二○处，此外有些县立高小尚附设有中学班。共有学生六三六九人。北岳区共二十二处，行署立中学七处，师范一处，县立简师十四处。学生共三一二七人。冀鲁豫区共十九处。行署立中学五处，县立简师十四处。学生共三四○七人。太岳区共十八处。行署立中学六处，师范一处，政民干校一处，县立简师中学十处。学生共三六三七人。石庄市共四处：市立中学，市立女中，市立师范，建设学院。学生共一八七五人。此外，华北中央局与华北政府所直属的有育才中学一处，学生四五○人，及职工学校、财经学校、会计学校、妇婴卫生学校等。\n    约三年的时间，华北解放区的中等学校，比抗日战争时期骤增了四倍。据日寇投降前的统计：那时全华北区共有中等学校三十四处，原晋冀鲁豫二十六处，晋察冀八处，学生六三五九人。这在抗日时期艰苦的游击战争环境里，成绩实属惊人。日寇投降的后半年与第二年上半年，中等学校即飞速地向前发展。晋察冀区中学由八处增加到四十三处，学生由一六五五人增加到六千余人。至张家口撤退前，又发展到五十六处，学生一○三五○人。晋冀鲁豫区学校也由廿六处增加到五○处。由于各地学生大批涌进学校，各校学生班次，都普遍增加。如太行四六年上半年，即由过去的九处中学，三十五个班，一三○九学生，迅速增到十四处中学，六十一个班，二六七四学生。到四六年底，又增至七十一班，三五○○学生。四七年，为了满足各地国民教育普遍发展所引起的师资要求，太行各县又设立了二○个简师，共三十七个班，受训师资一四八○人。其他如冀南、太岳、冀鲁豫等地，中等学校，短期也获得迅速发展。\n    日寇投降以后，华北解放区中等学校如此蓬勃发展，一方面是由于各地教育工作者适应新的形势。全力扩大和创设新校，另一方面，则由于我们在新收复城市，正确执行了对知识分子的政策，把接收过来的学校，迅速恢复的原故。如晋察冀收复张家口及其他城市后，中学即迅速开学。晋冀鲁豫在收复济宁后，市内第七中学，济宁师范，女子中学等校，都迅速恢复，连抗日战争中垮台的战前学校，如鄄城师范、郓城师范、宁阳中学、寿张师范、阳谷中学、清丰师范学校，也都在这时被民主政府重新建立起来。这些学校的原有教员，及抗日期间隐居乡间的知识分子，不少参加了新学校的教育工作。在太行我军解放邢台、焦作、博爱等地后，当地中等学校的原有教员，绝大部分仍留原校教书，刚从敌人长期统治下解放出来的新生入学，在四五年即达一○一九人。其他地区情形，大体相同。\n    在人民解放战争的紧张的两年多中间，华北中等学校在各种困难条件下，坚持了工作，培养了三六一六八个学生，这些都是教育工作者努力的成绩，是值得表扬的。但是由于形势的变化，领导上方针不明确，无制度，无计划，没有及时建立一定制度，致使中学教育不能完全适应战争和建设的需要。又加以在土改与整党中，错误地把农村斗争的一套搬运到学校来，曾经一时地造成学校的混乱状态。这些都大大影响了中等教育应有的成绩。特别是去年冬季，许多教员和学生，仅仅因为家庭出身的关系或某些作风上的缺点，受到了不应有的打击和清洗。这是一个严重的损失。这种错误，今春以来，部分地区即已开始纠正。现在情况已经改变过来。太岳给被清洗的教职员学生写信，冀中指派专人下去纠正。其他各区都进行了纠偏，并获得相当的成效。被清洗的教职员学生，逐渐回校，没有回校的也大部分参加了工作。入夏以后，各区召开了中学会议，研究了教育方针，端正了教育政策，继续贯彻纠偏，各地中学又呈现着新的气象。冀南今春六处中学，只有八百多名学生，纠偏后，现在已增加到一五四八人。\n    这次华北中等教育会议，更明确规定了今后中等教育方针，制订了学制课程、统一了思想，华北解放区中等教育事业，在已有的基础上，定量做出了灿烂的成绩。"

    "content": "Taihang Electric: The villages at the Heshun Wenyuan Base Point are actively setting up \"bonfire platforms\" to prevent frost. The climate in this county is relatively cold, and frost occurs every year between \"White Dew\" and \"Autumn Equinox,\" which greatly damages unmatured autumn crops. On August 18th, the base point specifically convened a meeting of village cadres to discuss methods for preventing and protecting against frost. The village head of Dongnao Village said: \"Prevention doesn't work; last year, the 'bonfires' in our village didn't do anything.\" Everyone said: \"The reason your village didn't work is that you started the fires too late. Last year, the villages of Jiujing, Shengtou, and others started fires appropriately, and not even a mu of land was damaged by frost.\" After discussion, everyone realized that the reason some villages didn't do well last year was that they had prepared a lot of firewood and only lit the fires for two nights. By the third night, when the frost came, they had no firewood, and the effort was wasted. They immediately learned from the experience and determined the frost prevention measures. After the meeting, most of the masses in each village turned out to collect firewood. By September 3rd, the villages had collected a total of 3,520 dan of firewood. Villages also conducted mutual inspections.

Western countries attempted to portray this conference as a meeting of foreign ministers. Vyshinsky delivered a speech strongly refuting this, pointing out that the conference was not a meeting of foreign ministers. Vyshinsky stated that, according to the Italian peace treaty, the foreign ministers' conference should consider the recommendations after the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference had submitted them. However, the U.S. government violated the treaty by refusing to send the Secretary of State to participate in the meeting, and the British government adopted the same attitude, making it impossible for the foreign ministers' conference to discuss this issue.

The directive first requires strengthening current affairs education for militiamen and laborers, ensuring that everyone understands that only by eliminating Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang reactionary clique can peaceful production and construction be carried out. It is particularly important to establish the concept of fighting to establish a People's Democratic Republic. Secondly, support-the-front education should be treated as an important part of social education, allowing every member of the masses to understand how they should consciously support the war. The content of the education includes two aspects: one is production savings and financial support, and the other is labor support through the mobilization of manpower and animal power. To this end, it is necessary to enhance the masses' understanding of the unity of current and long-term interests, and to enhance the masses' understanding of the unity of individual family interests and national interests. Thirdly, it is necessary to rectify participation organizations according to the needs of the front line, implement scientific organization, strive for cadre stabilization, and establish company-level organizations to ensure good organization in peacetime and rapid mobilization when needed. It is necessary to strengthen organizational discipline education, overcome the phenomenon of some cadres being afraid to lead and extreme democracy resulting in disorganization and indiscipline. In addition, military training and exercises must be carried out, such as air defense, marching, camping, utilizing terrain and ground features, dispatching quartermaster services, and disassembling stretchers.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行人民武装部指示各地　加强参战教育整顿组织\n\n1948-09-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行人民武装部指示各地\n  　加强参战教育整顿组织\n    【太行电】太行军区人民武装部八月三十日指示各地，利用目前生产季节与战争空隙，认真进行参战教育与组织整顿，以准备迎接大规模的参战任务。指示首先要求加强民兵民工的时事教育，要使大家认识只有消灭蒋介石及国民党反动集团，才能进行和平生产建设。并特别要树立为建立人民民主共和国而战斗的观念。其次应把支前教育作为社会教育的重要部分，让每个群众懂得自己该如何自觉的去支援战争。教育内容包括两方面，一方面是生产节约，财力支援，一方面是出动人力畜力的劳力支援。为此就必须提高群众对目前利益和长远利益统一的认识，提高群众个人的家庭利益与国家利益统一的认识。再次，要根据前线战争需要，整顿参战组织，实行科学编制，并求得干部固定化，成立连队组织，做到平时组织好，用时调动快。要加强组织纪律教育，克服某些干部不敢领导和极端民主的无组织无纪律现象。另外，必须进行军事训练和演习。如防空、行军、宿营、利用地形地物、派遣勤务、拆卸担架等。"

After more than a month of study, most organizations have completed the first two documents. Many comrades felt after studying that their theoretical level was low, and they did not pay attention to the Party's policies, relying on narrow experience to blindly and recklessly act, committing many unnecessary mistakes. The meeting made special research and discussion on improving learning methods and other issues, and first required leaders to personally lead, grasp the key points and give timely guidance, regularly summarize experience, answer difficult questions, and instruct on improved methods. The task of the organization's branch should be regular inspection. Secondly, it emphasized ideological leadership to enlighten comrades' learning consciousness, cultivate their ability to independently think about problems, advocate freedom of thought, boldly put forward different opinions, and debate to their heart's content, but when a stage is over, the leadership must make a clear conclusion. In terms of learning methods, empiricism should be opposed. Some comrades one-sidedly exaggerated practical experience, and in handling practical problems and solving specific ideological problems, they showed that they could not improve, treating the foot when it hurts and the head when it hurts. There were also some comrades who regarded themselves as \"practical,\" had no reading habits, and had no interest in exploration and research. When they saw others flipping through books or looking for reference materials in their studies, they thought it was dogmatism. In the future, attention should be paid to making every comrade attach importance to theory and overcome empiricism. Third, learning should not be regarded as a shock task, and should not be too tense. Individual organizations study in the morning, work during the day, and study again at night, and everyone feels very tired. It should be carried out step by step, and the study of the Four Great Documents should be used to regularize the learning of organ cadres.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行区党委宣传部　检查直属机关学习\n\n1948-09-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行区党委宣传部\n  　检查直属机关学习\n    【太行电】此间区党委宣传部，于八月廿五日召开直属机关第二次学习会议，检查四大文件的学习情况。经过月余学习，大部机关都学完了前两个文件。许多同志学习以后感觉到自己理论水平既低，又不注意党的政策，凭着狭隘的经验盲目蛮干，犯了许多不应有的错误。会上对改进学习方法等问题，作了专门研究讨论，首先要求首长亲自领导，抓住关键给以及时指导，定期总结经验，解答疑难，指示改进方法。而机关支部的任务，应是经常的检查。其次强调思想领导，以启发同志们的学习自觉，培养他们独立思考问题的能力，提倡思想自由，大胆提出分歧意见，尽情争辩，但告一段落时，一定由领导上作出明确结论。在学习方法上要反对经验主义。有些同志片面的夸大了实际经验，在处理实际问题和解决具体思想问题时，表现出提不高，脚痛医脚头痛医头。另有一些同志，以“实际”自居，无读书习惯，更无探讨钻研兴趣，看到别人在学习中翻翻书本子或找点参考材料的学习，就认为教条主义。今后应注意使每个同志重视理论，克服经验主义。第三、学习不能当作一个突击任务，不应过分紧张，个别机关早上学习白天工作，晚上又学习，大家觉得很疲劳。应按步就班的进行，通过四大文件学习把机关干部学习经常化起来。"

    "content": "New Atmosphere in the Jinzhong New District\n　　I. The Taiyuan-Fenyang Highway is Revived\n　　The Taiyuan-Fenyang Highway, which was lifeless under the rule of the Yan bandit gang, has been revived with the liberation of Jinzhong. In the past, there were few pedestrians on this road, because anyone who walked on it would be interrogated and harassed by the Yan bandits, and even be labeled as \"collaborating with the bandits\" and lose their lives. Now that the people are liberated, the road is also liberated. Every day, people, horses, and vehicles come and go in an endless stream, and the number of small vendors along the road has surged. In the section from Fenyang to Wenshui alone, there are more than 70 households. The common people say: \"In the past, the Taiyuan-Fenyang Road belonged to Yan Xishan, but now it belongs to us, the common people.\"\n　　II. Grand Temple Fair Held in Xiaoyi City\n　　On July 23rd, Xiaoyi City held its first temple fair since liberation. The number of attendees reached 50,000 to 60,000, including 346 merchants from as far away as Beiping, Tianjin, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Suiyuan, as well as 440 mules and horses, and countless small vendors. The bustling situation was the first of its kind in ten years. Under the rule of the Yan bandits, Xiaoyi City had no contact with other places and was lifeless. After liberation, it became accessible in just two or three months, with merchants coming and going, making it prosperous and lively.\n　　III. Taigu Democratic Government Protects Industry and Commerce\n　　When the Taigu County government took over the Yan puppet public-run stores, it first conducted a preliminary investigation. At that time, it was found that there were 17 stores in the city with Yan bandit signboards. After further investigation, it was found that only seven stores, such as \"Preparation Warehouse\" and \"Pingzhi Association,\" were public-run stores of the Yan bandits. The other ten stores, although bearing Yan bandit signboards, were actually privately funded. For example, the pseudo-prefecture commissioner's mill was jointly established by pseudo-county government staff, and the \"Tax Goods Cooperative\" and \"Cultural Service Center\" and other commercial firms hung up public signboards out of fear of \"preferential grain\" and \"standing soldiers\" under the rule of the Yan bandits. The democratic government did not touch any of the private funds of the above two types of stores. If there were Yan bandit official funds, it only took over the Yan bandit official part and allowed them to continue operating. Mr. Wu Huaning, the owner of Guang Shengyu, said: \"Now we can do business. The democratic government protects private funds and allows us to operate freely.\"\n　　IV. Fenyang City Establishes a People's Hospital\n　　Fenyang City suffers from serious diseases and disasters. The democratic city government cares about the people's suffering and established a people's hospital at the former site of the Yan bandit health院. Most of the staff in the hospital are newly liberated doctors and nurses. They deeply feel the leniency and preferential treatment of our Party towards them and are working actively.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋中新区新气象\n\n1948-09-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋中新区新气象\n  　一、太汾公路复活了\n    在阎匪统治下死气沉沉的太（原）汾（阳）公路，随着晋中的解放也复活了。过去这条路很少行人，因为谁要在路上走，就要受到阎匪们的盘问留难，甚至给戴上“通匪”帽子丧了性命。现在人民解放了，路也解放了，每日路上人马车辆络绎不绝，路旁小摊贩激增。仅汾阳到文水一段，即达七十余家。老百姓说：“过去太汾路是阎锡山的，现在成了咱们老百姓的了”。\n    二、孝义城举行大庙会\n    七月二十三日孝义城举行解放后的第一次庙会，赶会者达五、六万人，内有北平、天津、陕西、宁夏、绥远等地远来的商人三四六家，到会骡马四四零头，大小摊贩无数，其热闹情况为十年来第一次。阎匪统治时，孝义城与各地不通往来，死气沉沉，解放后只两三个月就四通八达，商贩往来，繁荣热闹了。\n    三、太谷民主政府保护工商业\n    太谷县政府在接收阎伪公营商店时，首先进行了初步调查。当时查出城内挂阎匪牌号的商店共有十七家，后经深入了解，发现只有“准备库”“平执会”等七家是阎匪的公营商店，另外十家虽挂着阎匪牌号，实际上是私人股金，如伪专署磨房即以伪县府职员合股开办，“税务货物合作社”与“文化服务处”等商号，是因在阎匪统治下怕出“优待粮”“常备兵”而挂起了公家牌号。民主政府对以上两种商号，私人资金一概不动，如有阎匪官方资金，也只接收阎匪官方那一部分，并让其继续营业。广升裕老板吴华宁先生说：“现在可以作买卖了，民主政府保护私人资金，能自由营业。”\n    四、汾阳市成立民众医院\n    汾阳市病灾严重，民主市府关怀人民痛苦，在阎匪卫生院旧址成立一民众医院，院内工作人员大部是新解放之医生护士，他们深深的感到我党对他们的宽大和优待，都在积极的工作。"

    "content": "[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th] TASS, Pyongyang dispatch: The Korean Supreme People's Assembly cabled the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union on the 10th, requesting the simultaneous withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea. The cable first pointed out that for three years, the Korean people's desire to rapidly restore national independence and establish an independent democratic state has not been realized. U.S. and Soviet troops still continue to be stationed in Korea, and therefore Korea is divided into two parts. In the north and south of Korea, completely opposite social, economic, and political systems have been established. This division seriously hinders the regeneration of Korea's economy, politics, and culture. The cable pointed out that this division, in addition to causing huge economic damage to the Korean people, also facilitates pro-Japanese elements and various reactionaries to incite hostility between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, as well as animosity between the North and South Korean people. This is a dangerous factor for world peace. The cable declared that there is no legitimate reason for foreign troops to continue to be stationed in Korea, because it has been three years since Japan surrendered and the Japanese army in Korea was disarmed. The decisions of the Moscow Conference on the Korean issue have in effect been obstructed. Therefore, the Korean people demand that all foreign troops immediately withdraw from Korea and allow the Korean people to decide their own destiny without foreign interference. The cable reiterated that the Korean people have consistently refused to recognize the illegal elections held in South Korea and the \"National Assembly\" and \"government\" established after the elections, and declared that the North-South Korean elections held in August were elections that truly reflected the free will of the people. The Korean Supreme People's Assembly, produced by this election, is the only legitimate supreme legislative power organ in Korea that truly represents the entire nation. The cable solemnly declared: \"The Korean Supreme People's Assembly hereby expresses the wishes and unyielding will of the entire Korean people, requesting the United States Government and the Soviet Government to immediately and simultaneously withdraw their troops from Korea.\" The cable concluded: \"The Korean Supreme People's Assembly, on behalf of the entire Korean people, conveys its gratitude to the great Soviet Government for its suggestion as early as September 26, 1947, that the U.S. and Soviet troops should simultaneously withdraw from Korea, and for repeatedly reiterating thereafter that as long as the U.S. government also withdraws its troops from Korea at the same time, the Soviet Union is willing to immediately withdraw its troops from Korea.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 朝鲜最高人民议会电美苏政府　要求美苏同时撤兵  感谢苏联早已提出撤军建议\n\n1948-09-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　朝鲜最高人民议会电美苏政府\n  　要求美苏同时撤兵\n    感谢苏联早已提出撤军建议\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜最高人民议会于十日致电美苏两国政府，请求将美苏军队同时撤离朝鲜。电文首先指出：三年以来朝鲜人民的迅速恢复民族独立与建立独立民主国的愿望迄未实现。美苏军队现仍继续驻留朝鲜，因此朝鲜被分为两部分，在朝鲜的北部和南部，已建立了完全相反的社会情况、经济情况与政治制度。这种划分严重地阻碍着朝鲜经济、政治、文化各方面的再生。电文指出：这种分割除使朝鲜人民蒙受巨大的经济损害以外，还便于亲日分子及各种反动分子煽动美苏两国的敌意以及南北朝鲜人民间的敌对情绪，这是对世界和平的危险因素。电文宣称，外国军队继续驻留朝鲜已无任何正当理由，因为自日本投降与朝鲜日军被解除武装以来，迄今已达三年。而莫斯科会议关于朝鲜问题的决定，实际上已遭受阻挠。故朝鲜人民要求一切外国军队立即撤离朝鲜和使朝鲜人民得以自行决定其命运而不受外国干涉。电文重申朝鲜人民始终不承认南朝鲜所举行的非法选举和选举后成立的“国民议会”与“政府”，并宣称：八月间所举行的南北朝鲜选举是真正反映人民自由意志的选举，而由这次选举所产生的朝鲜最高人民议会，是真正全国的惟一合法的朝鲜最高立法权力机关。电文至此郑重宣告：“朝鲜最高人民议会兹表示全体朝鲜人民愿望与不屈的意志，请求美国政府与苏联政府立即同时将其军队撤离朝鲜”。电文最后称：“朝鲜最高人民议会代表全体朝鲜人民向伟大的苏联政府转达谢意，感谢它远在一九四七年九月二十六日即已建议美、苏军队同时撤离朝鲜，并于其后一再重申，只要美国政府也将其军队同时撤离朝鲜，苏联愿意立即将其军队撤离朝鲜。”"

    "content": "Correcting Past Deviations and Determining Future Policies\n　　North China Holds Conference on Secondary Education\n\n　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The North China Conference on Secondary Education was held in a certain location in North China on August 25th. The conference lasted twelve days and concluded on September 5th. Based on the current needs of the People's Liberation War and the construction of the North China Liberated Area, the conference re-examined the direction, nature, and tasks of general secondary education, stipulated the implementing principles and methods for the formal education system and curriculum, corrected past confusion and deviations, and unified the thinking of education workers. Finally, it adopted draft proposals such as the implementation measures for middle schools and teachers' colleges, and the standards for the treatment of primary and secondary school teachers and staff, which were submitted to the North China Government for review and promulgation.\n\n　　Prior to the conference, the Taihang, Taiyue, Jizhong, Jinnan, and Jilu Yu Administrative Offices had all held education conferences successively. Although the Beiyue District had not held a conference, it had made preparations for convening one. According to incomplete statistics: in the six administrative districts and one municipality in the entire region, there are 138 secondary schools (including teachers' colleges), with 23,084 students; vocational schools are not included. In the past two years, 36,168 students have been assigned to work, supplying the needs of various aspects of war and construction. North China's secondary education has made achievements and has contributed to the people. This is the result of the arduous struggle of all middle school teachers and staff and education administration cadres under extremely difficult conditions of human and material resources. However, there have also been many shortcomings and deviations in secondary education. The first is that the direction and tasks are not clear, and the development of the situation has not been adapted to in a timely manner. The unavoidable and necessary nature of training classes in the past guerrilla warfare environment for secondary schools has not been overcome in a timely manner, and a certain necessary formal system has not been established. Not enough emphasis has been placed on the basic education of cultural and scientific knowledge necessary for general middle schools. In land reform and party rectification, the rural struggle was mistakenly moved to schools in its entirety. Poor peasant associations were also organized in many schools to struggle against landlords and rich peasants, squeeze out feudalism, distribute floating wealth, and conduct three investigations, and absurd slogans such as \"filling in and completing culture,\" \"culture returning to agriculture,\" and \"students having their own schools\" were put forward, which once threw schools into a state of chaos. This situation has now been corrected. Each administrative office made a review of these situations at the education conference. Taihang focused on reviewing the so-called \"vocationalization\" of the education policy. Jizhong reviewed the policy towards intellectuals. All administrative offices unanimously reviewed the phenomena of lack of system, lack of planning, and lack of discipline in secondary education, and initially proposed implementation measures for secondary education. The North China Conference on Secondary Education was convened on this basis.\n\n　　More than 40 people attended the conference, including heads of education administration and representatives of middle school and teachers' college principals from various administrative offices and cities. Major faculty members of the Second Department of North China University were also invited to participate. The conference was presided over by Comrade Chao Zhefu, former Director of the Education Department of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, and Comrade Liu Aifeng, former Director of the Education Department of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. Comrade Zhou Yang, Minister of Propaganda of the North China Central Bureau of the CPC, personally guided the conference. First, Director Chao Zhefu made a report on the direction of secondary education, and put forward draft proposals such as the implementation measures for secondary education, which were submitted to the conference for study and discussion. The conference conducted detailed discussions, and Comrade Zhou Yang made a special speech during the discussion, which led to a consensus among the participants.\n\n　　The Task of Middle School Education: To Cultivate Talents with Secondary Cultural Level and Basic Scientific Knowledge for the New Democratic Country\n\n　　The conference clearly pointed out that middle school education is general education in nature. Its task is to cultivate talents with secondary cultural level and basic scientific knowledge for the New Democratic country, so that after graduation, students can participate in work after a certain professional training, or directly participate in work, or continue to study for further education, to meet different needs in various aspects. The task of teachers' colleges is to cultivate and improve primary school teachers and junior education administration cadres for the New Democratic country. The conference reviewed the past ambiguity of the direction of middle school education, blindly advocating the so-called \"vocationalization,\" advocating \"central work is the central curriculum,\" and inappropriately emphasizing \"learning from doing\" and \"teaching from doing,\" which led to the relaxation or even cancellation of the cultural education that should be possessed by general middle schools. For example, Yubei Middle School, under this policy, students went out of the school and organized three work-study groups to learn in actual work. In one semester, only three Chinese language articles were taught, and they were also taught as political classes. As a result, the students' working ability was not as good as that of the local cadres, and the students' cultural level could not be improved as necessary. In addition, due to financial difficulties, the policy of \"supporting study through work\" was inappropriately put forward, resulting in an excessive increase in students' production, and the school became a \"production team.\" In many schools, students did not attend classes for even half the time. Therefore, the low cultural level of students has become a common phenomenon, which has been criticized by all sectors of society. The students themselves also strongly demand to learn culture. However, many schools ignored this legitimate demand of students, and some schools even asked students to reflect on their so-called \"pure cultural viewpoint.\" This spring, many schools' enrollment simply emphasized composition. In the entrance examination, some students could only write two of the three characters of their own names. According to statistics from 25 middle schools, half of the new students enrolled this spring were below the level of primary school graduation. The same is true for primary schools. Some teachers have a low cultural level and cannot teach students to read, and some teach students to engage in production and social activities, and do not teach students to read. The masses reflected that it was \"a dou of rice for one character,\" and said that \"the Eighth Route Army's schools are good, but they don't know how to read.\"\n\n　　The conference reviewed the chaotic phenomenon of lack of system and lack of planning in secondary education in the past, pointing out that the common shortcomings in middle schools in the past were that students had too much mobility, were recruited and transferred at any time, and the school became a cadre \"supply station\" and \"distribution center\" for various departments. In the past two years, Jizhong No. 1 Middle School has transferred a total of more than 1,500 students, of which more than 80 students only stayed in school for one week. The longest study time for students did not exceed one year. No. 4 Middle School was transferred 18 times last year, and in March this year, 127 students were transferred out in 9 times in 25 days. Jin Yu Middle School in Taiyue often had only more than 100 students last year, but the number of students transferred out throughout the year reached 209. As a result of such frequent transfers, schools were often busy with enrollment, class placement, and solving teaching difficulties, and could not implement education plans or cultivate students with a certain cultural and scientific level. Therefore, this conference clearly stipulated that the duration of study in junior high school is three years, and a one-year short-term middle school will be established to take care of the current urgent needs. Senior high schools will be established as needed and possible. The duration of study in teachers' colleges is three years, and one year for simplified teachers' colleges. Establish a scientific and reasonable examination system, and strictly control entrance, promotion, and graduation examinations. Students are not allowed to be transferred midway before the graduation deadline.\n\n　　Establish a Formal School System\n　　Overcome the View of Neglecting Culture\n\n　　In adhering to the formal system, the conference believed that it is necessary to overcome the view of neglecting cultural learning. The conference specifically criticized the erroneous view in the past that emphasizing cultural learning would deviate from politics, or that it would be an old-fashioned formalization. It pointed out that cultural knowledge is a tool; when we master it, it is our weapon to fight against the enemy. Today, we do not have too much culture, but rather we have no culture or too little culture. Therefore, improving culture itself is a serious political task at present. In order to effectively strengthen cultural education, it is necessary to reduce students' social activities, productive labor, and reduce excessive political classes. The conference clearly stipulated that activities such as productive labor, student self-government, and social services should not exceed eight hours per week, and the task of production for public purposes should be abolished. Students participating in social activities, production, and acting with more than three days of class suspension must be approved by the competent authority before they can proceed. It is also stipulated that the actual class time per year shall not be less than 36 weeks. The conference believes that all methods that are effective in improving culture should be adopted. We cannot reject them all just because these methods were once adopted by old-fashioned schools, regardless of whether they are good or bad, or whether they meet our needs, and call them old-fashioned formalization.\n\n　　The conference also reviewed the ideological and political education in middle schools, believing that although the ideological and political education in middle schools in the past has achieved certain results, there are too many portions, and there are shortcomings in the content and methods. No matter what class is taught, it must be linked to politics, and even the sun must be studied for its class nature. Too many political articles that are not easy for middle school students to understand were selected for Chinese language textbooks. History classes neglect historical facts and abstractly talk about the laws of historical development and lessons learned. As for the political class itself, it often instills students with abstract and empty nouns and terms, lacking specific and vivid content. In addition, the methods of struggle such as forced tracking of thoughts, introspection, and confession adopted in the life review meetings are also undesirable. The conference believes that the ideological and political education in secondary schools must be effectively improved in the future. The amount and content of political classes must be appropriately stipulated, and the method of forced struggle must be prohibited. The students' thoughts must be transformed with the method of true education.\n\n　　Pay Attention to Classroom Teaching and Teacher Guidance\n　　Individual Learning Supplemented by Collective Mutual Assistance\n\n　　In terms of teaching, the conference believes that it is necessary to pay attention to classroom teaching and the guiding role of teachers. The content of education must be practical, and the methods of education must be linked to reality. Teachers should be good at setting an example, inducing and enlightening, so that the education plan can be transformed into students' conscious and automatic actions. Students should focus on individual learning, supplemented by collective mutual assistance. Under the spirit of collectivism, develop students' personality. The conference criticized the past abuse of collective learning, even mathematics classes required collective discussion, neglecting the importance of individual learning and individual efforts, and even thinking that \"individual understanding does not count, only everyone's understanding counts.\" This is unreasonable. This conference stipulates that collective discussions should be limited to courses related to ideological education, and can only be held once a week.\n\n　　Regarding the leadership of schools, the administrative offices and municipal governments should strengthen the leadership of the secondary schools under their jurisdiction. Administrative offices should strengthen inspection and guidance. Special administrative offices and county governments should help local schools solve difficulties. The school's internal leadership is the responsibility of the principal. The principal is responsible to the government for completing the tasks assigned by the government. After the direction of secondary education is determined, the teachers play a decisive role in the work. In the past, the living conditions of primary and secondary school teachers were too low, and they must be appropriately improved. At the same time, the political life and professional learning of teachers should be improved. The view of neglecting and excluding intellectuals is wrong and must continue to be corrected.\n\n　　After repeated discussions and revisions, the conference unanimously approved the implementation measures for general middle schools and teachers' colleges, and the draft standards for the treatment of primary and secondary school teachers and staff. The attendees were very satisfied with the conference. Liu @, Director of the Education Department of the Jizhong Administrative Office, said: \"This conference has solved problems that have not been solved for a long time. However, the implementation of the policy is not easy, and it is necessary to vigorously promote the creation of various places and prevent it from developing into rote learning.\" Gao Zhenwu, an old educator from Jilu Yu, who is 69 years old, said: \"This time, all the past problems of the school have been corrected. Everyone has changed together, and I am very happy. Although I am old, I still want to work hard. I hope everyone will work hard and compete.\" Comrade Zhou Yang finally encouraged everyone that the conference has stipulated the direction and system of middle school education, and hoped that everyone would boldly create within the stipulated scope and make more achievements on the education work front.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 纠正过去偏向确定今后方针　华北开中等教育会议\n\n1948-09-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　纠正过去偏向确定今后方针\n  　华北开中等教育会议\n    【本报特讯】华北中等教育会议，于八月二十五日在华北某地召开。会议历时十二日，于九月五日结束。会议根据目前人民解放战争与华北解放区建设的需要，重新检讨了普通中等教育的方针、性质与任务，规定了正规学制、课程等实施原则与办法，纠正了过去的混乱与偏向，统一了教育工作者的思想。最后并通过了中学与师范实施办法，中小学教职员待遇标准等草案，送呈华北政府审核，公布实行。\n    会议前，太行、太岳、冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫各行署都先后举行过教育会议。北岳区虽未举行会议，也已作了召开会议的准备工作。据不完全的统计：全区六个行署区，一个市，共有中等学校（包括师范）一三八处，学生二三、○八四名，职业学校不在内。两年以来，有三六、一六八名学生分配工作，供给了战争与建设各方面的需要。华北中等教育是有成绩的，是对人民有贡献的。这是全体中学教职员与教育行政干部在人力物力极端困难的条件下艰苦奋斗的结果。但中等教育中也曾有不少缺点和偏向，首先是方针任务不明确，没有适应形势的发展，及时地克服中等学校在过去游击战争环境中所不可免的而且必要的训练班性质，而建立一定的必需的正规制度，没有足够地重视普通中学所必需的文化科学知识的基础教育。在土改与整党中又错误地把农村斗争的一套原封原样搬到学校中去，不少学校中也组织了贫农团，斗争地富，挤封建，分浮财，进行三查，并荒谬绝伦地提出什么“文化上填平补齐”“文化还农”“学生有其校”的口号，曾经一时地使学校陷于混乱状态。现在这种情况是已经纠正了。各行署针对这些情形在教育会议上作了检讨。太行着重检讨了所谓“职业化”的教育方针。冀中检讨了对知识分子的政策。各行署都一致检讨了中学教育中无制度、无计划、无纪律的现象，并初步提出了中等教育的实施办法。华北中等教育会议，是在这种基础上召开的。\n    会议到各行署市教育行政负责人及中学师范校长代表四十余人。华北大学第二部主要教职员，也被邀参加。大会由前晋冀鲁豫教育厅长晁哲甫同志与前晋察冀教育处长刘皑风同志主持。中共华北中央局宣传部长周扬同志亲临指导大会。首由晁哲甫厅长作中等教育方针的报告，并提出中等教育实施办法等草案，交大会研究讨论。大会进行了详细的研讨，在讨论中周扬同志作了专门性的发言，使大会意见趋向了一致。\n  　中学教育任务：为新民主主义国家培养具有中等文化水平及基本科学知识的人才\n    大会明确指出了中学教育是普通教育性质。其任务是为新民主主义国家培养具有中等文化水平及基本科学知识的人才，使学生毕业后，经过一定专业训练，即能参加工作，或直接地参加工作，或继续升学深造，以适应各方面不同的需要。师范学校的任务，则是为新民主主义国家培养与提高小学师资及初级教育行政干部。大会检讨了过去对中学教育方针不明确，曾盲目地提倡所谓“职业化”，提倡“中心工作即中心课程”，不适当地强调“从作中学”，“从作中教”，致放松了甚至取消了普通中学应有的文化教育。例如豫北中学，就在这种方针下，学生走出了学校，组织三个工学团，到实际工作中去学习。一学期只教了三篇国文，也是当政治课讲的。结果，这些学生的工作能力，既不如当地的地方干部，学生的文化水平也得不到必要的提高。又由于财政困难，曾不适当地提出“以工养学”方针，致过分加重学生生产，学校成了“生产队”。许多学校，学生上不到一半时间的课。因此，学生文化水平低，成为普遍现象，遭到社会各方面的批评。学生本人也强烈要求学文化。但许多学校忽视了学生的这种正当要求，有的学校甚至反而叫学生去反省自己的什么“单纯文化观点”。今春许多学校招生单纯强调成份，有的学生入学考试，连自己名字的三个字都只会写两个。根据二十五个中学统计，今春新收学生，有一半不到高小毕业程度。小学也是这样，教员有的文化水平低，不能教学生识字，有的教学生去搞生产与社会活动，不教学生识字，群众反映说是“斗米一字”，说“八路军的学校好是好，就是不识字”。\n    大会检讨了过去中等教育中无制度无计划的混乱现象，指出过去中学普遍存在的缺点是学生流动性太大，随招随调，学校变成了各部门的干部“供应站”“收发处”。冀中第一中学，两年以来，共调出学生一千五百余人，其中八十余人，入校只一个星期。学生学习时间最长的也超不过一年。第四中学，去年一年学生被调十八次，今年三月，二十五天中又调出学生九次，共一二七人。太岳晋豫中学去年经常只有一百多个学生，但全年调出的学生，即达二○九人。这样频繁抽调的结果，学校便经常忙于招生编班和解决教学的困难，无法实施教育计划，无法培养一定文化科学水平的学生。因此，这次会议明确规定初级中学修业期间为三年，为照顾目前的急需，设立一年制的短期中学。视需要与可能设立高中。师范学校修业期限为三年，简师为一年。建立科学合理的考试制度，严格入学、升学与毕业考试。学生未到毕业期限，不许中途抽调。\n　　建立学校正规制度\n    克服轻视文化观点\n    在坚持正规制度中，大会认为必须克服轻视文化学习的观点。会议特别批评了过去那种认为强调文化学习就会脱离政治，或者就是旧型正规化的错误观点。指出文化知识是一种工具；掌握在我们手里，就是我们向敌人斗争的武器。今天我们不是文化太多，而是没有文化或文化太少了。因此，提高文化本身就是当前一个严重的政治任务。为了切实加强文化教育，必须减少学生的社会活动，生产劳动，减少过多的政治课。大会明确规定生产劳动、学生自治、社会服务等活动，每周不得超过八小时，生产缴公任务一律取消。学生参加社会活动、生产、演戏停课在三天以上者，必须经过主管机关批准，才能进行。并规定每年实际上课时间不得少于三十六周。大会认为凡在提高文化上有效的办法，都应该采用，不能因为这些办法，旧日学校曾经采用过就不分好坏，不管是否合乎我们需要，一律名之为旧型正规化，加以排斥。\n    关于中学的思想政治教育，大会也进行了检讨，认为过去中学的思想政治教育，虽收到了一定成效，但是分量太多，内容与方法都有缺点。不管讲什么课，都要联系政治，甚至讲太阳也要研究它的阶级性。国文教材选了过多的为中学生所不易理解的政治性的文章。历史课则忽视历史事实，抽象地讲什么历史发展规律与经验教训。至于政治课本身又往往是灌输学生一些抽象空洞的名词术语，缺乏具体生动内容。还有生活检讨会上采取强制追思想反省坦白等斗争办法，也是要不得的，大会认为今后中等学校的思想政治教育必须切实加以改进，必须适当规定政治课的分量与内容，禁止采用强制斗争的方法，而用真正教育的方法，改造学生的思想。\n　　重视课堂教学教师指导\n    个人学习辅以集体互助\n    在教学方面，大会认为必须重视课堂教学及教师的指导作用。教育内容必须切合实际，教育方法必须联系实际。教师应善于以身作则，诱导启发，使教育计划变成学生自觉自动的行动。学生应注重个人学习，辅以集体互助。在集体主义精神下，发展学生的个性。大会批判了过去滥用集体学习，什么课程甚至数学课都要集体讨论，而忽略了个人学习，个人努力的重要，甚至认为“个人会，不算会，大家会，才算会”，这都是不合理的。这次会议规定集体讨论应限于有关思想教育的课程，而且每周只能有一次。\n    关于学校的领导方面，各行署市府对所管辖的中等学校应加强领导。行署要加强视察指导。专署县府要帮助所在地学校解决困难。学校内领导为校长负责制，由校长对政府负责，完成政府所交给的任务。中等教育方针确定之后，对工作起决定作用的是教员。过去中小学教员生活待遇太低，必须适当加以改善。同时应提高教员的政治生活与业务学习。轻视与排斥知识分子的观点，是错误的，必须继续加以纠正。\n    经过会议反复讨论与修改，最后一致通过了普通中学与师范学校实施办法，及中小学教职员待遇标准等草案。到会人员对会议进行都是很满意的。冀中行署教育厅长柳＠说：“这次会议解决了长期没有解决的问题。但方针贯彻是不容易的，必须大力发扬各地的创造，防止发展为读死书”。冀鲁豫六九高龄的老教育家高镇五先生说：“这次把学校过去的毛病都改正过来，上下一齐改，心里很高兴。我虽然老了，还要干，希望大家努力竞赛”。周扬同志最后勉励大家，会议已规定了中学教育方针和制度，希望大家在规定的范围内大胆的去创造。在教育工作这条战线上作出更多的成绩来。"

    "date": "1948-09-21",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS reports: The Soviet Red Star newspaper recently published an article entitled \"US Monopoly Capital and the Militarization of the United States,\" stating that US monopoly capital is deliberately creating a war crisis domestically in order to pursue new profits. One of the most prominent features of the United States today is the rise of new large companies producing war materials. American arms magnates, like Krupp in pre-defeat Germany, play a decisive role in American political and economic life. Many facts illustrate the close ties between US monopoly capital and major military groups. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Undersecretary of the Army Draper, Undersecretary of the Air Force Whitney, and Undersecretary of the Navy Brown all previously held important positions in American banks and industries. At the same time, an increasing number of representatives of military factions are being selected to serve as leaders of monopoly capital groups. They are closely linked together. It is these figures who are promoting the new arms race and provoking new wars.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Various reports indicate that the profits of major US corporations have increased again compared to last year. Comparing the first half of this year with the first half of last year, the profits of Standard Oil of New Jersey rose from $134 million to $210 million, General Motors Corporation from $137 million to $206 million, and US Steel Corporation alone can earn an additional $180 million annually from steel price increases. One of the main reasons for this surge in profits is the expansion of government military spending and military orders, which has greatly increased the burden on the American people. According to a United Press report on the 5th, citing sources from the US Department of Defense, the US Army, Navy, and Air Force budget for the fiscal year 1949 (from July 1st of this year to June 30th of next year) totals $15.25 billion. This figure is more than $4 billion higher than what Truman proposed in January of this year, accounting for 36 percent of the total US budget expenditure. As a result, the military spending burden on the American people in peacetime has increased from an average of $8 per person in 1938 to an average of about $100 per person now. If the so-called \"foreign aid expenses\" are included, the burden on each American per year will be even more staggering. Furthermore, according to Truman's review on the 15th of last month of the congressional revisions to the fiscal year 1949 budget, the total expenditure of the US budget for this year has increased from $39.6 billion proposed in January to $42.2 billion, while the total revenue has been reduced from $44.4 billion to $40.7 billion, resulting in a deficit of $1.5 billion, which has to be made up from the previous year's surplus.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美独占资本家追逐新的利润　故意挑拨新战争\n\n1948-09-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美独占资本家追逐新的利润\n  　故意挑拨新战争\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联红星报最近于题为“美国独占资本与美国军国主义化”一文中宣称：美国独占资本为追逐新的利润，故意在国内制造战争危机。美国今日最突出的特征之一，就是生产战争物资的新的大公司的兴起。美国的军火大王如象德国战败前的克虏伯一样，在美国政治经济生活中起着决定性的作用。许多事实说明美国独占资本与主要军人集团间的密切联系。国防部长福莱斯特尔、陆军部次长德莱伯、空军部次长惠特尼、海军部次长布朗等人以前都曾在美国银行和工业中占有重要职位。同时军事派系的代表被选来充当独占资本团体领袖的人数，也越来越多。他们紧密地结合在一起。宣传新军备竞赛，挑拨新战争的正是这些人物。\n    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方报导：美国各大公司的利润较诸去年又有新的增加。以今年上半年与去年上半年相比较，新泽西美孚油公司的利润从一亿三千四百万元升至二亿一千万元，通用汽车公司从一亿三千七百万元升至二亿零六百万元，美国钢公司则仅由钢产加价一项，每年即可多获利润一亿八千万元。这种利润激增的主要原因之一，就是由于政府军费与军事订货的膨胀所致，而这种军费的膨胀则大大加重了美国人民的负担。据合众社五日电引美国防部人士称：美国一九四九年度（自本年七月一日至明年六月卅日）的海陆空军预算共达一百五十二亿五千万元。这一数字较杜鲁门今年一月所提者增加了四十亿元以上，占美国预算总支出的百分之三十六。因此，美国人民和平时期的军费负担已自一九三八年的每人平均八元增至现在的每人平均一百元左右。若再计入所谓“援外费用”的支出，则美国每人每年的负担将更为惊人。又据杜鲁门上月十五日在检讨国会修正的四九年度预算时声称，美国本年度预算的总支出已自其一月份所提出的三百九十六亿元增至四百二十二亿元，而总收入则反自四百四十四亿元被削减至四百零七亿元，因而形成了十五亿元的赤字。不得不由上年度的盈余项下予以弥补。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 18th: Reports from various sources indicate that the 80th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress was held in Margate from the 6th to the 10th of this month. It was attended by 850 delegates, representing 188 trade union units affiliated with the British Trades Union Congress. Although these delegates included representatives from progressive unions such as the National Union of Mineworkers and the Electrical Trades Union, most of the delegates could not represent the true interests of the British working masses. The conference was conducted under the control of the right-wing leadership group – the Standing Committee. According to a Reuter's dispatch, before the meeting, the Standing Committee, in close cooperation with Bevin and Cripps, reached a complete agreement with representatives of the major capitalists, deciding to do everything possible to suppress the voices of protest from trade union members at the conference. On September 5th, the Standing Committee of the Trades Union Congress issued a statement expressing support for the government's reactionary wage freeze policy and opposing all methods of controlling profits. Nevertheless, the right-wing leadership group could not suppress the progressive unions from putting forward motions that truly represented the demands of the workers. As a result, the left and right wings engaged in a struggle at the conference, the focus of which was the issue of wages, prices, and profits. Representatives from two powerful unions – the National Union of Mineworkers and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions – proposed a motion to increase wages. They argued that current wages were insufficient to maintain a reasonable standard of living, that the measures taken by the government had failed to prevent wages from falling, and demanded the control of profits and dividends; they advocated that the unions' support for the government should be conditional on reducing prices and limiting profits. Although this wage increase proposal was rejected by a majority of 5.2 million votes at the conference, it received as many as 2.18 million votes in favor. Due to the manipulation of the right-wing leadership group, the conference and its Standing Committee also rejected progressive motions such as \"immediately nationalizing the steel industry,\" \"approving the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions and praising its defense of the interests of the working people against monopoly capitalism,\" and \"proposing a new meeting between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to restore wartime unity.\" In addition, because the right-wing leadership group was intimidated by the growing dissatisfaction of the working masses with high prices, and because the passage of certain particularly reactionary motions would excessively expose their true colors, the conference passed a motion calling on the government to \"more effectively control prices\" and rejected a motion \"requesting the British government to remove communist officials.\" The conference also unanimously passed a resolution \"demanding a sharp increase in Anglo-Soviet trade relations.\" On the closing day, the conference elected Will Lawther as Chairman of the Standing Committee to replace Hancock.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 18th: TASS, Moscow, September 13th: A Pravda observer wrote that the British Trades Union Congress held in Margate well demonstrates the characteristics of the current policies of the Labour Party and, generally speaking, right-wing socialist parties. The conference announced policies that were completely adapted to the demands of monopoly capital and openly opposed to the interests of the working people on all issues before it. The Margate conference promoted the \"Marshall Plan,\" by which American capitalists enslave Western Europe. At the same time, the heads of the conference created an atmosphere of frenzied slander against progressive representatives of the British and international working-class movement, and spread rumors attacking the World Federation of Trade Unions and the Soviet trade unions. The article pointed out that after the trade union leaders adopted policies that completely violated the demands of British workers, they said: The question is whether the trade union leaders can force British workers to agree to these policies. This question seriously troubles the British ruling group. The voting at the Margate conference does not reflect the mood of the working masses at all. This is manifested in the widespread spontaneous strikes that disregard leadership and the election of new figures with progressive tendencies to leading positions in trade unions. In Britain, as in other Western European countries, the gap between the working masses and the right-wing socialist leadership organs that have openly sided with big business is widening.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 英职工大会举行年会  会上表现右派社会党完全适应独占资本的要求，公然反对劳动人民利益。\n\n1948-09-21\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　英职工大会举行年会\n    会上表现右派社会党完全适应独占资本的要求，公然反对劳动人民利益。\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】各方报导：英国职工大会第八十届年会，于本月六日至十日在马盖特举行，到会代表八百五十人，代表英国总工会所属之一百八十八个工会单位，这些代表中虽然包括进步工会如全国矿工联盟、电气工业工会等的代表，但大部分代表是不能代表英国工人群众的真正利益的。大会在右翼领导集团——常委会的操纵之下进行。据电通社消息称，在会前，常委会在贝文与克利浦斯的密切合作下，与大资本家的代表达成了完全的协议，决定尽一切办法压制职工会会员在大会中抗议的呼声。九月五日，总工会常委会发表声明，表示支持政府反动的冻结工资政策，并反对一切管制利润的办法。然而，尽管如此，右翼领导集团仍不能压制进步工会提出真正代表工人要求的动议。因之，左右两翼在大会上展开了斗争，其焦点为工资、物价与利润问题。两个强有力的工会——全国矿工联盟与造船工人工会的代表在会上提出增加工资的议案。他们认为目前的工资不足以维持合理的生活标准，政府所采的措施，未能阻止工资的下降；要求管制利润和红利；主张工会对政府的支持，应以减低物价和限制利润为条件。这一增资提案虽为大会五百二十万票的反对票所否决，但赞成的有二百十八万票之多。由于右翼领导集团的操纵，大会及其常委会并否决了“立即使钢铁工业国有化”、“批准世界工联活动并赞扬其保卫劳动人民利益反对垄断资本主义”以及“建议英美苏举行新会议以恢复战时团结”等进步议案。除此之外，由于右翼领导集团慑于工人群众对物价高涨的日益不满和某些特别反动的议案的通过将会过份地暴露他们的真面目，大会通过一项要求政府“更有效地管制物价”的议案，并否决一项“要求英政府清除共产党官员”的动议。大会并一致通过了一项“要求急剧增加英苏贸易关系”的决议。在闭幕日，大会选举了威尔·劳瑟为常委会主席以代替汉考克。\n    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报观察家著文称：在马盖特举行的英国职工大会，很能表现工党以及一般说来右派社会党目前政策的特点。大会对于摆在它面前的一切问题，都宣布了完全适应独占资本要求并公然反对劳动人民利益的政策。马盖特大会宣扬美国资本家奴役西欧的“马歇尔计划”，同时，大会的头子们制造了疯狂污蔑英国和国际工人阶级运动进步代表的情势以及造谣攻击世界工联和苏联职工会的气氛。该文指出工会领袖们采取了完全违反英国工人要求的政策之后称：问题在于工会领袖是否能够迫使英国工人同意这种政策。这一问题严重地苦恼着英国统治集团。马盖特大会上的投票，最不能反映工人群众的心境。这表现在蔑视领导而在各处爆发的很多自发的罢工以及选举具有进步倾向的新人物担任工会领导职务。在英国，象在其他西欧各国一样，工人群众与公然投靠大企业的右派社会党领导机关之间的鸿沟是正在加深着。"

    "content": "Regulating Rainfall to Reduce Natural Disasters\n  　Northern Yue Proclamation Bans Mountain Clearing and Afforestation\n    [Northern Yue Dispatch] The Northern Yue Administrative Office issued a proclamation on September 6th regarding the prohibition of mountain clearing and afforestation, stating: \"Droughts, floods, wind, and hail are the greatest threats to agricultural production. The Northern Yue region loses no less than one million *shi* annually due to these disasters, greatly affecting the national economy and the people's livelihoods. The fundamental reason lies in the scarcity of trees and the abundance of sand and stones, leading to climate imbalance and unfavorable weather. Only by prohibiting mountain clearing and extensively afforesting can we regulate rainfall and reduce natural disasters. However, some people, seeking temporary gains, are clearing mountains everywhere, cutting down trees in large quantities, and even setting fire to slopes, destroying forests. This is extremely detrimental to economic development and increased production. For the long-term interests of the people, all counties and districts must earnestly educate the masses to implement the prohibition of mountain clearing and afforestation.\" The methods are: (1) For all uncultivated mountain land, regardless of slope or soil thickness, from now on, planting trees and afforestation should be universally promoted, and clearing land for cultivation should be prohibited. Those whose livelihoods are insufficient due to the prohibition of mountain clearing will be assisted by the government to develop sideline occupations or resettled on the plains. (2) All reclaimed mountain land that can be managed long-term should be terraced and cultivated intensively. Those that can only be cultivated temporarily should be planted with trees to gradually transform them into forest areas. (3) It is strictly forbidden to indiscriminately cut down trees. Before trees mature, sparse trees may only have branches trimmed occasionally, and dense trees may only be felled according to plan. After trees mature, felling must be approved by the government, and replanting must be carried out on the original site after felling. (4) It is strictly forbidden to set fire to mountains. Those who violate the law and cause damage will be required to replant or restore the vegetation for minor offenses, and those who commit serious offenses will be subject to criminal penalties. (5) All prohibited mountains and forests must not be arbitrarily cut down. Grazing must be allowed according to regulations based on the size of the trees. Illegal damage should be compensated, or appropriate punishment should be given. (6) Each village must establish a forest protection agreement and conduct regular mass education.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 调节雨量减少天灾　北岳布告禁山造林\n\n1948-09-21\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　调节雨量减少天灾\n  　北岳布告禁山造林\n    【北岳电】北岳行署于九月六日发出关于禁山造林布告称：水旱风雹为农业生产之最大危害，北岳全区每年因此减产不下一百万石，影响国计民生甚大。其根本原因，在于树木过少，沙石太多，以致气候失调，风雨不顺。只有禁止开山，广泛造林，才能调节雨量，减少天灾。而部分群众因图一时之利，到处开山，大量砍树，甚至放火烧坡，破坏林木，这对发展经济，增加生产极为不利。为人民长久利益着想，各县区务须切实教育群众实行禁山造林。其办法：（一）凡未开垦之山地，不论坡度大小土层厚薄，自今以后普遍提倡植树造林，禁止开荒种地。其因禁止开山而生活不足者，由政府扶助开展副业，或于平川招垦安置。（二）凡已开垦堰山地可以长期经营者，均应修成梯田，实行精耕细作。只能暂时耕种者，即加种树木，逐渐改为林区。（三）严禁滥伐树木，树未成材以前，稀者只许以时加枝，密者只许按照计划砍伐，树已成材之后，伐前须由政府批准，砍后须就原地补栽。（四）严禁放火烧山，违法破坏者，轻的令其补栽补种，重者酌予刑事处分。（五）一切禁山禁林，不得任意砍伐，放牧须按林木大小规定开放办法，违法破坏应令补偿，或予适当处分。（六）各村须定护林公约，经常进行群众教育。"

After visiting, the Handan representatives planned to return to Handan and suggest to the city government and the Federation of Industry and Commerce that they also hold an exhibition to exchange experiences with other regions and develop industrial production. Businessmen from Changzhi particularly praised the bellows and five-colored fabrics made in Linqing City. After visiting, businessmen from Jinan, a city in the Chiang-occupied area, expressed great admiration for the industrial development of the liberated areas. Fan Kaiyang, manager of Rongmao, a private business in the city, felt greatly encouraged and increased confidence in developing industrial production after visiting the conference. He said, \"I never expected that the Jilu豫 factory could manufacture cigarette machines and the city's 'May 1st' factory could make loudspeakers at this exhibition.\"\n\nThe conference propaganda section also set up a propaganda room next to the venue, filled with combat photos, slogan cartoons, newspapers, magazines, and various production statistics tables of the city to help visitors browse. In addition, theatrical troupes from various streets performed plays at the venue every night to add to the fun. Slogans promoting the development of industry and commerce and the prosperity of the market were posted throughout the city. The children's corps paraded with lanterns at night, performing the Yangko dance. The whole city was filled with an atmosphere of excitement, joy, and jubilation. The conference has now been going on for three days, and under the leadership of the presidium, the participating business owners are enthusiastically evaluating and selecting excellent industrial products as learning models.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 交流经验提高产品质量　临清工业品大展览\n\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　交流经验提高产品质量\n  　临清工业品大展览\n    【冀南电】临清市工业品展览大会于九月二日正式开幕。各行业厂主、工人以互相观摩、交流经验、提高技术和质量等实际行动来庆祝该市解放三周年。展览会共分铁工、竹木、百货、兄弟区四个展览室。参加展览业户达四百七十三家，兄弟区未计。展览品共一千九百八十九件。铁工室七十四户，展览品有风弓、轧车，织布机、印刷机、锅及各种农具、日用家具共五百三十五件。竹木室一百三十七户，展览品有蒸笼、锅盖、竹篦等共四百九十七件。百货室二百六十二户，展览品有军用民用皮件和各色花布、手巾、农具、肥皂等日用品九百五十七件。各兄弟区室陈列者有冀鲁豫工业管理处出产之五尺元车（旋床）、卷烟机、抽水机及因转运不便以照片展览的十五马力的柴油机、纺纱机、火柴机和各种皮件及化学用品。邯郸的西药十多种，南宫的花线毯、沟河的火硷、某部队军用皮件等共五十余件。来往观众拥挤各室。占名、高阳、长治及蒋占区城市客商也都来参观，蒋占区客商赶来参观者约一百六十余人。邯郸代表参观后，准备回邯郸后建议市府和商联会，也召开一个展览会，与各地交流经验，发展工业生产。长治客商特别称赞临清市造的风弓及五色花布。蒋占区城市济南客商参观后，对解放区工业发展非常羡慕。该市私商荣茂经理范开阳参观大会后，发展工业生产的信心倍加提高。他说：“在这个展览会上，冀鲁豫工厂制造的卷烟机和本市‘五一’工厂造的扩音机，是我想不到的产品”。大会宣传科并在会场旁边设置宣传室，满屋陈列着战斗照片、标语漫画、书报杂志和该市各种生产统计表，以助观众浏览，并有各街剧团每晚在会场上演戏助兴。市内遍贴发展工商业、繁荣市场的标语。儿童团夜间提灯游行，扭秧歌，全市充满了兴奋、愉快、，欢欣鼓舞的空气，现大会已进行三日，参加展览的各业主在主席团领导下，正热烈评议，选择优良工业品，作为学习榜样。"

    "content": "[Jizhong Electric] In many villages in Jizhong, various preparations for wheat planting are being actively carried out. Beiman Zheng, Zhujiazhuang, and Liujikou villages in Anping, which suffered from flooding, could not drain the water quickly due to the low-lying terrain. Farmers in these three villages dug a three-li long and five-chi wide drainage ditch. From August 9th to 24th, they drained more than 4,600 mu of land. There are still 2,120 mu that have not been drained. The district office and the Anping Flood Control Headquarters mobilized more than 100 laborers to deepen the drainage ditch, which can be completely drained in six days. It is estimated that wheat can be planted on the drained land. In Wangjiazhuang, villagers plan to plant wheat on more than 1,100 mu of waterlogged land out of 3,100 mu. They have already started plowing the land and have plowed 350 mu in six days. Small-scale mutual aid has been organized using methods such as exchanging labor for animal power between those with and without livestock, and those with weak and strong livestock. The whole village plans to plow the drained land twice before planting wheat. Many villages in Anguo, Qingyuan, and Boye counties are actively repairing and purchasing farm tools. In order to plant more wheat, the masses in various places are actively accumulating fertilizer. In Haotouzhuang, Second District of Ding County, all 208 households are accumulating fertilizer. The eight households that accumulated the most fertilizer averaged over 80 cartloads of green manure per household. Ordinary households averaged 63 cartloads, and the least accumulated an average of 40 cartloads per household. The whole village has produced more than 12,000 cartloads of fertilizer, which can be applied to more than 1,200 mu of wheat land. Since the reclassification of social status in Nanluncheng, the masses have actively engaged in production. Fifty households have accumulated 60 pits of manure in one month, totaling over 700 cartloads, enough to fertilize more than 200 mu of land. In Xidaliang, Eighth District of Anping, people have been busy adding grass and accumulating fertilizer since they picked up their hoes. The whole village has 537 households and 325 pigsties, as well as many manure pits. Generally, one stye has been filled twice in two months. In Xutuan village, one-third of the crops were flooded and yielded nothing, and one-third had reduced yields. To prepare for wheat planting, each household accumulated three styes of fertilizer in 35 days. Some farmers said, \"When seedlings are flooded, plant wheat fields, take an early step to solve the difficulties.\"\n\n[Jinan Electric] In Nanhe and Daming, to ensure that the flooded areas plant wheat on time, the leadership actively guides the masses to block breaches and divert water. In Nanhe, the Nanfeng River breached its banks in two places this year, flooding approximately 1,000 qing of land. To ensure that wheat can be planted on time in the flooded land, the government sent the head of the Construction Section to the Fourth District to assist village cadres in more than ten villages in mobilizing over 1,000 people. On the 25th, they completely blocked the breach at Da Hao Village and built a dike 50 zhang long. Most of the water has now flowed away and seeped dry, allowing 222 qing of land to be sown on time. They are now mobilizing the masses to block the breach at Chongzhuang. In the First District of Daming, half of the district cadres (the other half led the insect catching efforts) were transferred on the 19th of last month to mobilize the masses from 14 villages to block the breach from Wangzhuang to Nanguantao. After seven days and nights of hard work by the cadres and the masses, the waterlogged land, approximately 50 li long and 6 li wide, was finally turned into fertile fields. The masses in more than 50 villages (about 30 villages in Daming and about 20 villages in Guantao) were overjoyed. An old man in Anzhuang said, \"Now that the breach is blocked, we don't have to sell the cattle or flee anymore, we can focus on planting wheat at home.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中冀南部分灾区群众　泄水积肥准备种麦\n\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中冀南部分灾区群众\n  　泄水积肥准备种麦\n    【冀中电】冀中各地好多村庄，正积极进行种麦的各种准备工作。安平水灾村北满正、朱家庄、刘吉口等因地势洼，水不能很快排泄，该三村农民便挖了一个三里长，五尺宽的泄水沟，从八月九日到二十四日，已脱出四千六百余亩。还有二千一百二十亩未脱出。该区区公所及安平防泛指挥部，又发动民工百余人，把泄水沟加深六天即可全部泄完，估计水脱地都能种上麦子。王家庄三千一百余亩水地，村民计划种麦一千一百余亩。现已开始耕地，六天中已耕完三百五十亩。耕地中，有牲口和无牲口的，牲口弱的和牲口壮的，都以人工换畜力等方式组织了小型互助。全村计划在种麦前把水脱地普遍耕两遍。安国、清苑、博野等县很多村庄，积极修理和购买农具。各地群众为了多种麦子，积极压肥。定县二区号头庄二百零八户，家家压肥，压的最多的八户，每户平均压八十来车绿肥，平常的每户平均压六十三车，最少的平均每户压四十车。全村共造肥一万二千多车，能上一千二百多亩麦地。南轮城从改订成份以后，群众积极生产，五十户一个月积了六十坑粪，有七百来车，能上二百多亩地。安平八区西大良，从挂了锄就忙着加草压肥，全村五百三十七户，有猪圈三百二十五个，还有好多粪坑，两个月一个圈一般的积了两圈。徐疃村庄稼有三分之一被水淹的没收成，三分之一减收一部。为准备种麦，三十五天中每家积了三圈。有的农民说：“青苗淹，种麦田，早接一步解困难。”\n    【冀南电】南和、大名为使水灾区按时种麦，积极领导群众堵口顺水。南和境内南沣河，今年决口两处，共淹地约千余顷。政府为使水浸地能按时种麦，由建设科科长亲赴四区协助十余村村干动员了千余群众，于二十五日将大郝村口子完全堵住，并筑埝长达五十丈，现大部水已流走和渗干，有二百二十二顷地可按时播种。现正发动群众堵塞重庄口子，大名一区，于上月十九日抽调一半区干（另一半领导捕虫），动员了十四个村的群众，堵王庄至南馆陶的口子，经过干部群众七天一夜的努力，终将约五十里长、六里宽的水地变成了良田。五十余村（大名三十村，馆陶约二十余村）的群众无不庆喜。安庄一个老头说：“打住了口子，牛也不卖了，人也不逃了，一心在家种麦”。"

Her husband has joined the army, and she wants to separate from her in-laws. After the separation, the masses are tilling her land for her, and she doesn't cultivate the five or six fen of garden land she was given. The weeds in the field are more than a foot high. This year, she harvested two shi and eight dou of wheat, and also wants to recover four dou of wheat in borrowed debt, totaling three shi and two dou of wheat (large dou). She eats well all day long and doesn't work, wandering around the streets. She wears a silver bracelet and good clothes, and goes wherever there is a gathering. She spends money freely, throwing away Mao banknotes. There are often three or five women who dress up and separate from the masses, constantly visiting her (she says they are her friends), eating, drinking, laughing, and not doing any work. Her in-laws don't dare to say anything, and when the village cadres speak to her, she not only doesn't listen but also argues and curses. The masses can't stand it at all, and the village cadres don't want to provoke her because she is a military dependent. For military dependents like this, can the grain harvested by the masses who till the land for her be given to her in installments instead of all at once, giving her a little less first (and saving the rest for her), to stop her from wasting it and make her work? What can be done?\n　　　　　　　　　　\n  　Neiqiu County Government Cooperative Section Zheng Hanjie\n\nAnswer: The military dependent woman in Daxinwang Village, your county, who is not engaged in production and is corrupt and wasteful, can be persuaded to participate in labor through persuasion and education. If education is ineffective, the women's association can lead discussions on specific measures, and everyone can criticize and educate her to correct her shortcomings. It is also permissible for everyone to believe that the grain tilled for her should not be given to her all at once in order to limit her waste.

Hong Kong's \"Far East Newsletter\" weekly published on the 11th of this month, Feng's letter to Mr. Li Jishen of Hong Kong on August 12th, stated that while Feng was residing in the United States, US government officials had indicated to him that as long as the anti-Chiang factions in China abandoned their united front with the Communist Party, the US government would \"abandon Chiang Kai-shek\" and support them with \"sufficient money and military supplies.\" The US official gave them \"six months to consider this matter,\" but Feng immediately replied, rejecting this despicable proposal. While implementing enticements, the American reactionaries also carried out threats against Feng. As Feng increasingly felt the deterioration of the environment in the United States, he was determined to return to the motherland to engage in effective struggle. Feng said in the above letter: The final departure was not without difficulties because the passport had expired. Feng condemned Chiang Kai-shek and the American reactionaries for attempting to subvert his plans; \"They are in league with the villains Chute and Luce in Congress and scold me whenever they have the opportunity.\" Former US Secretary of the Interior Ickes wrote on the 8th of this month that Chiang Kai-shek, a dictator as cruel as Hitler or Mussolini, had sent his henchmen to pursue Feng with the apparent permission or even help of the US government. \"Feng had reason to suspect that he was not safe here, so he quietly set off for another land; he hoped to find greater safety in that land to avoid possible assassination.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冯玉祥曾拒绝美帝诡计  留美时遭中美反动派联合压迫　决心回祖国来从事有效的奋斗\n\n1948-09-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冯玉祥曾拒绝美帝诡计\n    留美时遭中美反动派联合压迫\n  　决心回祖国来从事有效的奋斗\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】国外消息报导：已故的冯玉祥将军曾勇敢地拒绝了美帝国主义破坏中国人民民主阵线的诡计，并遭受了中美反动派的联合压迫。本月十一日香港“远东汇报”周刊刊载冯氏八月十二日致香港李济琛氏信称，冯氏留居美国时，美国政府官员曾向他表示，只要中国反蒋的派别抛弃与共产党联合的立场，美国政府便会“抛弃蒋介石”，而以“充足的金钱与军火”支持他们。该美国官员给他们“六个月时间考虑这事”，但冯氏立即作了答复，拒绝了这个卑鄙的提议。美国反动派在实行利诱的同时，向冯氏实行了威胁。冯氏在日益感觉到美国环境的恶劣时，决心回到祖国来从事有效的奋斗。冯氏在上述的信中说：最后的启程不是没有困难的，因为护照已满有效期。冯氏谴责蒋介石与美国反动派企图颠覆他的计划；“他们与国会里的恶棍楚德和鲁斯联成一气，一有可能就痛骂我”。前美国内政部长伊克斯于本月八日著文称：与希特勒或墨索里尼同样残酷的独裁者蒋介石，曾在美国官方显然的允许甚至帮助之下派遣他的鹰犬追逐冯氏。“冯氏有理由猜疑他在这里是不安全的，所以他悄悄地动身到另外一块土地上去；他希望能在那块土地上找到较大的安全，以免遭遇到可能的暗杀。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th. After undergoing political rectification and preliminary technical training, the second-line corps of the second phase in various military regions of Northern Manchuria have now launched a large-scale military training movement. The units of the Hejiang Military Region particularly emphasized the integration of training with actual combat experience. In response to several unrealistic shortcomings identified after the first-phase second-line corps joined the main force in combat, it was decided that more aiming at head targets and moving targets should be incorporated in shooting practice this time; when throwing grenades, the action of uncovering and pulling the pin must be included. Many soldiers often run first and then hold their breath to practice aiming, so that they are more confident when shooting on the battlefield. Some soldiers practice throwing grenades targeting enemy bunker loopholes, conducting live throwing exercises to overcome the formalism of simply emphasizing \"throwing far.\" Significant progress has been made in various techniques in each unit. A certain regiment has produced a sharpshooter who hit 95 rings with ten shots. After the technical training in Nenjiang units came to an end, they have now switched to tactical education. In the study, a certain regiment pays attention to linking actions such as blasting, crossing trenches, throwing grenades, charging, and street fighting, and conducts actual exercises to enable commanders and fighters to clearly understand tactical thinking. In addition to actively training during the day, some companies of a regiment in the Songjiang Military Region have also made lantern targets to practice aiming and shooting at night, with good results. In grenade throwing practice, some soldiers initially only threw 15 meters, but after a few days, it doubled to 35 meters. The enthusiasm of the soldiers for training is very high. Some soldiers are reluctant to rest and interrupt their training even when they have minor illnesses. They say, \"At the front, we don't leave the line of fire even with minor injuries. Why would we rest when we have a slight illness while training in the rear?\" The training work in other military regions such as Jilin, Liaobei, and Heilongjiang is also progressing actively and smoothly. After the end of military training, the Heilongjiang Military Region is conducting widespread military education tests to check training results and summarize experience. The test methods are divided into live ammunition shooting, bayonet fighting, grenade throwing, blasting, tactical exercises, and other items, and formalism and simple championshipism are avoided in the test.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北满二期二线兵团政治整训完毕　展开军事大练兵运动\n\n1948-09-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北满二期二线兵团政治整训完毕\n  　展开军事大练兵运动\n    【新华社东北十九日电】北满各军区第二期第二线兵团经过政治整训及初步技术教练后，现已展开军事大练兵运动。合江军区各部特别强调与实际战斗经验结合，针对第一期二线兵团加入主力作战后所检讨出的若干不切实际的缺点，决定在这次练习射击时要多瞄人头靶、活靶；投弹时须将揭盖拉练的动作列入。许多战士常先跑步，再压住气练习瞄准，以便到战场上射击时更有把握。有的战士以敌地堡枪眼为目标练习投弹，进行实地投掷，克服单纯的讲究“投弹远”的形式主义，现各部对各项技术均获显著进步，某团并出现十枪射中九十五环的神枪手。嫩江各部于技术教练告一段落后，现已转入战术教育。某团学习中注意联系爆破、过壕、投弹、冲锋、巷战等动作，并进行实际演习，使指战员们都能明显的体会战术思想。松江军区某团若干连队除日间积极练兵外，并做了灯笼靶，在夜间练习瞄准射击，效果颇好。练习投弹中，开始有些战士仅投十五米，几天后即倍增至三十五米。战士练兵情绪十分高涨，某些战士虽生小病也不愿休息中断，他们说：“在前方轻伤都不下火线，在后方练兵有点小病还休息吗？”他如吉林、辽北、黑龙江各军区练兵工作，亦均在积极顺利进行中。黑龙江军区于军事教练结束后，为检查练兵成绩与总结经验，正普遍举行军事教育测验，测验办法共分实弹射击、刺杀、投弹、爆破、战术演习等项目，在测验中均力免形式主义与单纯的锦标主义。"

Therefore, the saying \"only lend to poor and hired peasants, not to landlords and rich peasants\" is no longer valid; (2) Under the directives of \"vigorously developing agricultural production\" and \"organizing the labor of landlords and rich peasants to strive for the common recovery and development of agricultural production,\" especially for \"landlords\" who have been deprived of basic means of production in the past, it is appropriate to provide loans to them when they have difficulties in production. Because doing so gives them a way out through labor reform and is beneficial to the development of social production. Another opinion is that loans should not be given, or even if they are given, they should not be treated the same as loans to middle peasants, poor peasants, and hired laborers. The reasons are: (1) Although land reform has been completed, the status of landlords and rich peasants cannot be changed for a while, so they cannot be given loans; (2) No document from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has ever stated that loans can be given to landlords and rich peasants.\n\n　　The above are the main bases for the two opinions. We are still unclear about who is right and who is wrong. Please provide an answer in the newspaper.\n\n　　　　Handan Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bureau　Tao Jie\n\n　　Answer: In areas where land reform has been thoroughly completed, feudal and semi-feudal exploitation has been eliminated. The future direction is to unite all working people in rural areas and organize the labor of landlords and rich peasants to restore and develop production, first and foremost supporting peasants in production. If the landlords and old-style rich peasants who have been liquidated are unable to carry out production, it is permissible to provide loans to them, as this is beneficial to the development of production. Therefore, treating loans to landlords and old-style rich peasants the same as loans to poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants is incorrect; however, it is also incorrect to believe that no loans can be given at all.\n\n　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 土地平分后，地富能否贷款？\n陶杰\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　土地平分后，地富能否贷款？编辑同志：\n    在土地改革业已彻底完成的地区，如地主富农在其进行或发展生产遇有困难（如缺乏必要的农具、种子、牲畜）不能解决时，我们能否贷款给他？一种意见认为可以而且应当贷给，理由是：（一）土改既已彻底完成的地区，作为封建或半封建的阶级——地主富农，已经成了历史上的名词，因此所谓“只贷给贫雇，不贷给地富”的说法不能成立；（二）在“大力发展农业生产”与“组织地富劳动力为共同恢复与发展农业生产而奋斗”的指示下，特别对过去被剥夺了基本生产资料的“地主”，当其进行生产有困难时，贷款给他是应当的。因为这样做是给他以劳动改造的出路，对发展社会生产也有好处。另一种意见认为不能贷给，即使贷给也不能与中农、贫雇农一般看待。理由是：（一）土改虽已完成，但地主富农的成份一时不能改变，因此不能贷给他；（二）中共中央任何文件上没有说过可以贷款给地富。\n    上边是两种意见的主要根据，谁是谁非，还弄不清楚，请在报上作一答复。\n    　　　　邯郸市工商局　陶杰\n    答：在土改彻底完成地区，封建半封建剥削，已经消灭，今后的方向是团结农村中一切劳动人民并组织地主富农的劳动力恢复与发展生产，首先是扶助农民进行生产，如果被清算后的地主、旧式富农无法进行生产时，贷款给他是可以的，这样对发展生产是有好处的。因此，给地主、旧式富农贷款与贫雇农、中农一般看待，是不对的；但认为完全不能贷给也是不对的。　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "Intensify Wheat Planting and Increase Grain Production\n  　Tuntliu Xucun Cadres Deeply Lead\n  　Wheat Fields Deeply Plowed and Manure Saturated\n    Expected to Complete Wheat Planting in Three More Days\n    [Taiyue Electric] Cadres in Xucun, the second district of Tuntliu, actively lead wheat planting. By September 5th, they had planted 800 mu of wheat, accounting for one-half of the village's wheat fields. After arranging wheat planting on August 14th, the cadres went deep into each group to lead wheat planting, and met once after dinner every day to exchange information and opinions, and used the radio station to commend the good and criticize the bad in a timely manner to promote wheat planting. Under such in-depth and timely leadership, all 21 small mutual aid groups, 210 male laborers, and 80 animals in the village went to the fields to plow and plant. More than 400 mu of the village's 1,225 mu of wheat fields were plowed four times, 550 mu were plowed three times, and the rest were plowed twice. Moreover, an average of 45 dan of manure was applied per mu. Miao Xian's first group applied 80 dan per mu on 130 mu of wheat. In order to give full play to the power of organization, fair methods of exchanging labor and wages were jointly stipulated within the mutual aid group. It was stipulated that animals plowing a day of land would receive 7 sheng of rice, and manual labor would receive 5 sheng. Sending manure and planting would count as two manual labor units for animals, and semi-labor was based on the amount of work. This was combined with participation in the war, and one labor unit for a combatant could be exchanged for one agricultural labor unit. Regarding substitute farming, Cui Daosheng, a committee member in charge of assisting the military, personally took charge during this wheat planting and planted the land for military families early. For example, Liu Junfa, a military family member, applied 50 dan of manure per mu to his 5 mu of wheat and plowed it three times, and it has now been planted. After arranging wheat planting on August 14th, the village had planted 800 mu of wheat by September 5th, and it is expected to complete wheat planting victoriously in three more days.\n    [Taiyue Electric] Lianfang Village in Gaoping Pangcun continues to plant wheat on time under the leadership of party members and cadres. Because each village actively composted and created fertilizer in the previous stage, this time it was possible to achieve \"deep plowing and saturated manure.\" Each village started planting on the 3rd. According to statistics from the four villages of Pucun, Zaili, Longqu, and Xiayujing, 30,004 mu of wheat have now been planted. Yan Jinwang of Xiayujing planted 6 mu of wheat and applied 120 carts of manure. Zhang Rui, a member of the Pucun Farmers' Association Standing Committee, planted 7 mu of wheat and applied more than 150 dan of thatch manure and 3,100 jin of Jinghao manure. Village Chief Han Mingshun planted 7 mu of wheat, and applied more than 100 dan of thatch manure alone, as well as slag manure and Jing fertilizer. In Zaili Village, 1,288 dan of green wormwood and 656 carts of slag manure were applied to 64 mu of wheat fields. At the same time, in order not to delay the autumn harvest and plant wheat in time, women were organized to participate, and a division of labor between men and women was implemented, striving to complete planting on the 12th or 13th, and wheat stubble wheat should also be planted in advance. The Women's Mutual Aid Group led by Tang Yinying harvested 5 mu of grain in one day. Yujing Village has harvested 74 mu of grain, 76 mu of sorghum, and also \"moved\" 36 mu of stubble.\n　　Some Villages in Wenxin and Renhe\n  　Actively Eliminate Wasteland and Plant Wheat\n    [Jizhong Electric] Some villages in Wenxin and Renhe (both newly established counties) actively eliminate wasteland and plant wheat. Recently, Qianxu Gezhuang, Jiliukou, and other seven villages in the western part of the fifth district of Wenxin found more than 80 mu of wasteland. The reasons for the wasteland are: (1) When distributing land during the land reform, district cadres did not work in depth and did not clearly propose a solution for land entrusted to outside villages. For example, more than 20 mu of land belonging to the Chen family landlord in Wen'an city and more than 10 mu of land belonging to the Lu Yunfei landlord in Zougezhuang to the north of Xiangguanzhuang Village have not been distributed, and no one has planted them to this day. (2) The Farmers' Association did not properly manage or assign people to cultivate some of the land of famine-stricken households. For example, 30 mu of such land were found in Jiliukou. (3) Some village cadres engaged in localism, and during the land reform, they were afraid of transferring land to outside villages, so land on the outer boundaries (i.e., far from their own village and close to other villages) was not reported, but it was not planted either. For example, 20 mu of land were wasted in Xizhuang in this way. After discovering this wasteland, the district cadres immediately organized the masses to investigate the wasteland, and the district cadres personally led the cadres of each village to investigate the land. The wasteland that was found was distributed to a part of the poor village of Guanzhuang. Now the masses in the village are cutting the weeds in the field and preparing to plant wheat. There are still 330 mu of wasteland in Caicun, the tenth district of Renhe, of which 130 mu were not distributed during the land reform, mostly thin land or too far from the village, and no one cultivated them; 200 mu were distributed to landlords and rich peasants, mostly bad land, and they lacked farm tools and livestock, so they were barren. Recently, when Zhang Wu of the district committee inspected the production situation in the village, he found this wasteland and immediately convened a branch committee meeting, made a review, and discussed solutions. Branch Secretary Kong Zao proposed using wood from floating assets to exchange for some livestock, and then getting some farm tools to distribute to landlords and rich peasants who did not have or lacked livestock and farm tools, so that they could produce well and plant wheat. The land that was not distributed was also mobilized by the masses to be divided up and planted with wheat. The masses in the whole village agreed with this method. Now the village is also actively eliminating wasteland and preparing to plant wheat.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 屯留许村干部深入领导　麦地犁深粪饱  预计再有三天即可完成种麦\n\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　加紧种麦增产粮食\n  　屯留许村干部深入领导\n  　麦地犁深粪饱\n    预计再有三天即可完成种麦\n    【太岳电】屯留二区许村干部，积极领导种麦，至九月五日已种麦八百亩，占全村麦地二分之一。该村从八月十四日布置种麦后，各干部都深入到每个组内领导种麦，并在每日晚饭后接头一次，交换情况意见，利用广播台及时表扬好的，批评坏的，以推动种麦工作。在这样深入及时领导之下，全村二十一个小型互助组，二百一十个男劳动力，八十头牲口全部下地犁地下种。全村一千二百二十五亩麦地，有四百多亩就犁了四遍，五百五十亩犁了三遍，其余犁过两遍。而且每亩平均上粪四十五担，苗先一组一百三十亩麦，每亩担上八十来担。因为要发挥组织起来的力量，又在互助组内共同规定了公道的变工方法与工资。规定牲口犁一天地七升米，人工五升，送粪下种牲口一工顶两个人工，半劳力是按活计工，并与参战结合，打战人一工可以换农业劳动一工。对代耕方面，抗勤委员崔道生，在这次种麦时亲自掌握，把军属的地早早种上。如军属刘均法的五亩麦，每亩上了五十担粪，犁了三遍，现在已种上。该村从八月十四日布置种麦后，到九月五日就已种麦八百亩，预计再有三天就可胜利完成种麦工作。\n    【太岳电】高平庞村联防村，继续在党员干部带领下，按时种麦。由于在前一阶段各村积极沤粪造肥，所以这次能作到了“犁深粪饱”。各村从三日起开始下种，据朴村、宰李、龙渠、下玉井四村统计，现已种麦三万零四亩。下玉井阎金旺种麦六亩，上粪一百二十车。朴村农会常委张瑞则种麦七亩，上茅粪一百五十余担，荆蒿粪三千一百斤，村长韩明顺种麦七亩，光茅粪就上了一百余担，还有渣粪、荆肥。宰李村六十四亩麦地，就上青蒿一千二百八十八担，上渣粪六百五十六车；同时为了不误收秋，回茬种麦，又组织妇女参加，实行男女分工，争取在十二、三日种完，老麦茬麦也要提前种上。妇女互助组唐银英领导六个妇女，一天就割谷五亩。玉井村已割谷七十四亩，割黍子七十六亩，还“搬”了三十六亩茬。\n　　文新任河有些村\n  　积极灭荒种麦\n    【冀中电】文新、任河（均新设县）有些村庄积极灭荒种麦。文新五区西部前许各庄、急流口等七个村最近查出荒地八十余亩。荒地的原因是：（一）土改中分配土地时，区干部工作不深入，未明确提出外寄庄地的处理办法。如向官庄村北便有文安城里陈家地主的二十余亩，邹各庄地主卢云飞的地十余亩未分配，到现在也没人种。（二）一部分逃荒户土地，农会没很好代管或派人耕种。如急流口就查出这样的地三十亩。（三）有的村干部闹本位，土改中怕往外村调剂土地，在外边界（即距本村很远、距别的村很近的）的地没有报上，但也没有种上。如西庄就这样荒了二十余亩。区干部发现这些荒地后，立即组织群众查荒，区干部并亲自带着各村干部到地里去查。将查出的荒地分配给穷村官庄一部。现该村群众正在割地里的荒草，准备种麦。任河十区蔡村现在还有三百三十亩荒地，其中一百三十亩是土改中没分配下去，多是薄地，或离村太远，没人耕种；有二百亩是分给地主富农的，多是坏地，他们缺少农具、牲口，因而荒芜。最近区委张晤到该村检查生产情况时，查出这些荒地后，立即召开了支委会，做了检讨，商量了处理办法。支书孔造提议用浮财里的木料换几个牲口，再弄一部分农具，分给没有或缺少牲口农具的地主富农，让他们好好生产，种上麦子。没分配的地，也动员群众分了，种上麦子。这个办法，全村群众都很同意。现该村也在积极灭荒，准备种麦。"

    "content": "【Taihang Electric】 The Shidong Village Cooperative in Wu'an has developed its business after democratic rectification. The cooperative originally had 4.5 million shares of capital and opened a wood factory with 1 million yuan. Except for the manager, the carpenters were all manual workers in the village who had left agricultural production. When the cooperative took on work, it would find a few workers in the village to do it, and the wages were set by the cooperative, generally lower than the market price, which made the workers very dissatisfied. There was also a building, accounting for 1.5 million yuan of capital, five staff members, and two livestock. After steaming the steamed buns every day, they had to ask two people to sell them in other villages. The store (selling groceries and vinegar) accounted for 2 million yuan of capital and had six staff members. Cadre treatment was a three-seven split of profits. Regardless of ability or skill, everyone received the same share. Due to the wrong business direction and high expenses, less money was earned. This time, each yuan only received a dividend of 8.54 cents in foreign currency. In addition, due to the lack of strict rules in the cooperative, outstanding debts reached more than 900,000 yuan. To transform this cooperative, the production work team stationed in the village first solicited opinions from the masses, organized small groups for deliberation, and held general meetings for discussion. Everyone unanimously believed that the building was a waste of labor and did not make money, and it also occupied the cooperative's capital, which was not in line with the policy of organizing mass production. After discussion, it was decided that private individuals should be allowed to do what they could, and the cooperative should provide support through investment and loans for what private individuals could not do. Commercial housing should be transferred to private businesses. The wood factory should also allow carpenters to develop freely. The cooperative should concentrate its capital on supporting and organizing mass production. Regarding the problem of outstanding debts, it was decided that cigarettes, alcohol, and other items should not be sold on credit, and daily necessities such as oil and salt could be temporarily owed for one month for convenience. Those who exceeded one month would be calculated based on the actual price increase and would be stopped from further credit. The cooperative would write the names of the debtors on a sign to let the members and the masses supervise their repayment. Cadre treatment was determined according to the level of skill and ability. In the half-month after the rectification, all outstanding debts have been recovered, and an additional 1.2 million yuan of capital has been added. The masses who lacked capital for production have been applying for loans from the cooperative, and their enthusiasm for production is very high. After carpenter Chu Taiji started free production, he partnered with three other households to open a carpentry shop. He said happily: \"In the past, carpenters in other villages earned 800 yuan a day, but we earned 600 yuan a day in the cooperative, and we didn't dare to work independently. Now I can rest assured.\" The cooperative has also begun to organize a credit cooperative to better solve the financial difficulties of the masses in production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 改变经营方针　组织群众生产　武安石洞合作社迅速发展\n\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　改变经营方针\n  　组织群众生产\n  　武安石洞合作社迅速发展\n    【太行电】武安石洞村合作社经过民主整顿，营业得到发展。该社原有四百五十万股金，开设一个木厂，一百万元，除经理外，木工均是该村脱离农业生产的手工工人。合作社揽上活时，即在村里找几个工人做，工资由合作社规定，一般均比市价低，工人很不满意，还有一个楼房，占资金一百五十万元，五个职员，两头牲口，每天蒸好后还得叫二人到外村卖。门市部（卖杂货醋房）占资金二百万元，职员六个，干部待遇是三七分红。不管能力技术高低都一样分。由于业务方向不对头，开支大，赚钱少，此次分红每元仅分洋八分五厘四。另外由于社里没有严格制度，外欠达九十余万元。为改造这一合作社，驻该村的生产工作队首先征求群众意见组织小组酝酿，大会讨论，大家一致认为楼房浪费劳力不赚钱，又占用了合作社资金，不合乎组织群众生产的方针。经过讨论，决定私人能干的，应尽量让私人干，私人干不了的，合作社应采取投资贷款等方式扶助。商品房应转给私营。木厂亦要让木工自由发展。合作社应集中资金扶植组织群众生产。对外欠问题，决定烟、酒等物坚决不赊帐，油盐等日用必需品，恐一时不便，可暂欠一个月。超过一月者，除按实物涨价后计算外，并停止其再赊欠。并由合作社把欠帐人名字写在牌上，让社员和群众督促其还帐。干部待遇，按技术与能力高低确定。整顿后半个月来，外欠已全部收回，并新增股金一百二十万元。群众生产没资金的，纷纷向合作社贷款，生产情绪很高。木匠褚太吉自由生产后，与另外三户合伙开设木匠铺。他高兴的说：“过去外村木工一天八百元，咱在合作社一天六百元，想单独干也不敢。现在我可放心了”。该社并已着手组织信用社，以更好解决群众生产资金困难。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-22",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 19th—The military recruitment campaign unfolding throughout the Jin-Sui area has now concluded successfully in counties such as Linxian, Lishi, Suixian, and Daixian. In some areas, the campaign has even exceeded the original plan by more than one-half. The reasons this recruitment campaign has received the enthusiastic support of the people, aside from the unprecedented heightening of the people's political awareness after the implementation of land reform and preliminary Party rectification, and the transformation of the style of work of cadres and Party members, are also due to the following three correct methods adopted by local leading organs in completing the recruitment work: First, boldly and openly conduct political mobilization, opposing assignment and coercion. At the beginning of mobilization in various localities, in-depth propaganda of \"For whom are we joining the army?\" was universally carried out. For example, in Guoxian County, the village peasant representative conference fully discussed \"Whose army is the People's Liberation Army, and for whom are they fighting?\", enabling the people to clearly understand \"This is our own army,\" and \"Fighting is for our own liberation,\" establishing the idea of the people's army and the people building the army, and breaking down the idea that some people regard joining the army as \"the higher-ups want soldiers.\" Some people also did not have enough understanding of the people's awareness, believing that \"other things can be democratic, but joining the army cannot be democratic,\" and \"there is not a single volunteer.\" However, after implementing political mobilization and creating a mass upsurge in joining the army, these erroneous understandings were broken by the facts. Various localities also universally held celebrations for the victory on the Jinzhong front, encouraging the people's emotions of joining the army to avenge themselves. Second, call on Party members and cadres to take the lead in joining the army and implement mass democratic recommendation and evaluation. In the past, only the masses were mobilized to join the army, but cadres did not move, causing dissatisfaction among the masses; this time, the leadership of Party members and cadres was put first. Due to the Party rectification, Party members and cadres actively took the lead in joining the army this time, and the movement immediately unfolded. Liu Feng, the secretary of the Linxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and many county and district cadres joined the army; in the second district of the county, Communist Party members accounted for half of the young people joining the army. In order to make joining the army reasonable, various localities, while cadres took the lead and the masses volunteered, also carried out mutual recommendation and democratic evaluation by the masses. However, during the recommendation and evaluation, in-depth political mobilization must still be carried out for the recommended or decided persons to avoid creating another form of coercion. Some areas have experienced this error. Third, establish the idea of being responsible to the people's army to the end. Not only guarantee the completion of the number, but also guarantee the quality. New soldiers must be approved by mass evaluation, no landlords or rich peasants, no old or weak, so that the troops can become \"elite soldiers.\" For example, in Longgong Village, Guoxian County, more than sixty people signed up, but only twenty-five were approved by the mass review. At the same time, it is also necessary to overcome the wrong idea of \"once the new soldiers are sent away, everything is fine,\" and truly do a good job in supporting the army and breaking down the family concerns of the new soldiers.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th—In recent months, the people of various counties in Andong Province have universally launched an upsurge in joining the army. More than 2,300 young adults have enlisted in five counties, including Fengcheng, Andong, and Xinbin.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥展开参军运动  进行政治动员反对强迫指派　党员带头自报群众认真公议\n\n1948-09-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥展开参军运动\n    进行政治动员反对强迫指派\n  　党员带头自报群众认真公议\n    【新华社晋绥十九日电】在晋绥全境展开的参军运动，现已有临县、离石、绥县、代县等县胜利结束，有的地区并超过原订计划二分之一以上。这次参军运动所以得到人民的热烈拥护，除了因为实行土地改革和初步整党后，人民的政治觉悟空前提高，和干部与党员的作风得到改造外，还因为各地领导机关在完成参军工作中采取了下列三种正确的方法：第一、大胆公开地进行政治动员，反对了指派和强迫。各地动员之初普遍进行了“为谁参军”的深入宣传。如崞县在村农代会中充分讨论了“解放军是谁的队伍，为谁打仗”，使人民明确地认识了“这是咱自己的军队”，“打仗是为自己解放”，树立人民军队、人民建军的思想，打破了有些人把参军认作“上面要兵”的思想。也有些人对人民的觉悟认识不够，认为“别的事情能民主，参军不能民主”，“没有一个自愿的”。但经实行政治动员造成参军的群众热潮后，这些错误认识都被事实打破了。各地还普遍召开了庆祝晋中前线胜利大会，鼓舞了人民参军复仇的情绪。第二、号召党员干部带头参军和实行群众民主推荐与评议。过去参军，只动员群众，干部却不动，引起群众不满；这次将党员干部带头提到第一位。由于经过整党，这次党员、干部都积极带头参军，于是运动立即展开。临县中共县委刘枫和许多县、区干部都参了军；该县二区参军青年中，共产党员占一半。为求参军的合理，各地并在干部带头和群众自报同时，由群众互相推荐和民主评议。但推荐与评议时，对被推荐者或议定者，仍要进行深入政治动员，避免产生另一种形式的强迫命令。某些地区是曾发生了这种错误的。第三、确立为人民军队负责到底的思想。不仅保证数目完成，还要保证质量。新战士都须经过群众评议批准，不要地富分子，不要老弱，使部队尽成“精兵”。如崞县龙宫村报名者六十余人，经群众审查批准的只二十五人。同时还要克服“新战士一送走就万事大吉”的错误思想，要真正做好优军工作，打破新战士的家庭顾虑。\n    【新华社东北十九日电】安东省各县人民近月来普遍掀起参军热潮，凤城、安东、新宾等五县已有二千三百余青壮年入伍。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, 18th—According to consolidated news from newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin: Students from Northeastern, Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces stranded in Beiping, Hankou, Nanjing, and other places are suffering from extreme mistreatment, deception, and persecution by the Kuomintang government, leading to immense suffering in their lives. Over 1,800 middle school students arriving in Beiping from Taiyuan are housed in the Temple of Heaven and the Imperial Ancestral Temple. Their request to establish a temporary Shanxi middle school has been rejected by the Kuomintang government, and issues such as food, lodging, and education remain unresolved. After Shanxi University students arrived in Beiping, the puppet mayor Liu Yaozhang deceived them, saying, \"As long as you can find housing, we will definitely allocate it to you.\" However, after they found and moved into houses in Diaoyutai near Zhongnanhai, the puppet municipal government immediately sent police to surround the area and order them to evacuate. On August 14th, the students of the university were left starving and trapped. On the 17th, two students were beaten and injured. In addition, several students from the university were beaten by military police on a tram. When they gathered all the students to go to the military police headquarters to demand punishment for the perpetrators, they were surrounded by military police who threatened them with guns. More than 300 Mongolian and Tibetan students arriving in Beiping are all living in the open at the Yonghe Temple. The Mongolian Compatriot Association provides each person with half a catty of millet per day, which is not enough to eat. Henan students stranded in Hankou formed begging teams in mid-August, with five or six dozen people in each team begging along the streets, looking haggard. At the same time, begging groups of Shandong and Henan students also appeared in Nanjing, with thirty to fifty people in each team, each team holding a small flag and begging from shops on the streets. Among them were female students.\n\nUnder mistreatment, persecution, and deception, students have actively launched struggles for survival. Shanxi students in Beiping have formed the \"Shanxi Students' Association in Beiping,\" and Mongolian and Tibetan students formed a petition group in mid-August to go to Nanjing to petition for a solution to their living and education problems. Shanxi University students, after being beaten and threatened, said angrily: \"All crows are black, Beiping is no better than Taiyuan.\" More than 300 Henan students stranded in Hankou, after their request to register for accommodation was rejected, angrily smashed the office of the Third Working Team of the Kuomintang Ministry of Education on August 10th. More than 1,700 Henan students surrounded the Nanjing Kuomintang Ministry of Education on the morning of August 10th to petition for a solution to their academic problems and an increase in relief funds. They dispersed in the afternoon under the pressure of military police.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 流落北平的太原学生　食宿无着受饿挨打  南京出现鲁豫学生乞食团　千余学生包围伪教育部请愿\n\n1948-09-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　流落北平的太原学生\n  　食宿无着受饿挨打\n    南京出现鲁豫学生乞食团\n  　千余学生包围伪教育部请愿\n    【新华社华北十八日电】综合平、津报纸消息：流落北平、汉口、南京等地的东北、山西、河南等省份学生，备受国民党政府虐待、欺骗与迫害，生活痛苦万分。由太原抵北平的一千八百余中学生，分住于天坛、太庙内，他们要求成立山西临时中学，已遭国民党政府拒绝，食、宿、学习等问题均无法解决。山西大学学生抵平后，伪市长刘瑶章欺骗他们说：“只要你们能够找到可住的房子，一定拨给你们住”。但当他们找到中南海钓鱼台屋及迁入后，伪市府即派警察前往包围，勒令迁出，八月十四日该校学生在被困中捱饿一天，十七日两人被殴伤。此外，该校学生数人曾在电车上被宪兵殴打，他们集合全体学生赴宪兵队要求惩凶时，又被军警包围，以枪口对准他们加以恫吓。抵平蒙、藏学生已超过三百人，全部露宿在雍和宫，蒙古同乡会每人每日发给半斤小米，无法吃饱。流落汉口的河南学生，八月中旬组成乞食队，每队五、六十人沿街乞讨，容颜憔悴。与此同时，南京亦出现山东、河南学生乞食团，每队三十至五十人不等，各队手持小旗，分向大街上商店行乞，其中还有女学生。\n    在虐待、迫害与欺骗下，学生们已积极展开求生存的斗争。北平山西学生已组成“山西流平同学会”，蒙、藏学生八月中旬组成请愿团赴南京请愿，要求解决生活及学习问题。山西大学学生在被殴打及恫吓后愤然说：“天下乌鸦一般黑，北平并不比太原好”。流落汉口的三百余河南学生，在要求登记收容遭拒绝后，于八月十日愤而捣毁国民党教育部第三工作队队部。河南学生一千七百余人，八月十日晨包围南京国民党教育部请愿，要求解决学业问题及增发救济费用，至下午始在军警压迫下散去。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Comprehensive report: Salt production in Bohai and Southern Liaoning has greatly increased after restoration and development. According to statistics from the first two months of this spring, the 1,025 salt fields in the Chengkou District Salt Field of Wudi County, Bohai, produced 70 million jin of salt, equivalent to the total output of the entire last year. The salt farmers in Chengkou started working on the salt fields around the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, half a month earlier than in previous years. In the past, there was a water shortage period from Grain Rain to the Beginning of Summer, but this spring, 2,800 zhang of water diversion ditches were dug, making the seawater inexhaustible, which greatly helped increase production. Influenced by the development of the salt industry in Huanghua (Xinhua) County, the masses in the surrounding six counties of Dongguang, Huimin, etc., have developed the transportation industry from salt-carrying porters. More than 570 old salt workers from the Kuomintang-controlled areas also fled to participate in salt production. The salt fields in Southern Liaoning have officially started production since the Spring Equinox this year. As of late July, a total of more than 380,000 tons of salt have been produced, exceeding the original target by more than 80,000 tons. The area has now restored more than 4,100 salt fields, employing more than 11,000 salt workers, repairing and adding more than 1,100 horsepower of electric power, building 64.3 kilometers of small railways, 610 trains, 1,500 beach houses, and five transformer substations. Workers have also established a new attitude towards labor. For example, the workers of the Baijiakou salt field in Fuxian County have voluntarily proposed to increase production three times, reaching more than 30% above the original plan, and the quantity and quality have exceeded the period of the puppet Manchukuo. In addition, after the Gaiping salt field started production this year, the workers also voluntarily increased working hours, digging more than 170 tidal ditches day and night. Production and administrative cadres have also gone deep into the salt fields to learn technical operations. At the end of the spring production, the Salt Affairs Bureau conducted a general democratic inspection to consolidate the foundation of salt production and solicited workers' opinions on production management. The salt fields in Southern Liaoning are now actively preparing for autumn production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 渤海、辽南盐业增产\n\n1948-09-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　渤海、辽南盐业增产\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：渤海、辽南各地盐业经过恢复和发展，产量大增。渤海的无棣县埕口区盐场一千零二十五付海滩，据今年初春两个月统计，即产盐七千万斤，等于去年全年总产量。埕口盐民于农历正月十五前后即下滩工作，比往年提早半月。往年从谷雨到立夏是缺水期间，今春挖了二千八百丈的引水沟，使海水用之不尽，对增产帮助极大。在黄骅（新海）县盐业发展的影响下，附近东光、惠民等六县群众，由运盐驮脚而发展了运输业。国民党统治区的五百七十余个老盐工，亦逃来参加晒盐。辽南盐场自今年春分正式开晒，至七月下旬止，共计产盐三十八万余吨，超过原定任务八万余吨。该地现已恢复盐田四千一百余付方，用有盐工一万一千余人，修复、添置电动力一千一百匹马力以上，修建小铁道六十四点三公里，火车六百十余辆，滩房一千五百余幢，变电所五处。工人并树立了新的劳动态度，如复县百家口盐滩工人，曾三次自动提出增加产量达原定计划百分之三十以上，数量质量均超过伪满时期。又盖平盐滩于今年开晒后，工人亦自动增加劳动时间，昼夜掏挖潮水沟一百七十余条。生产行政干部更深入盐滩，学习技术作业。在春晒结束时，盐务局为奠定盐业生产基础，进行了普遍的民主大检查，征求工人对生产管理的意见。辽南盐场刻正积极准备秋晒工作。"

    "content": "[JiluYu Electric] Chengwuxian County has suffered severe flooding, with six out of eight districts in the county inundated. The average reduction in autumn grain harvest for the entire county is expected to be more than half. In some areas, the land is completely submerged, making wheat planting very problematic, and wheat seeds are also scarce. Some people are selling cattle and donkeys due to lack of food, which would further hinder wheat planting. Failure to plant wheat will exacerbate the famine. To address this, the county government convened a meeting of cadres from various districts to study how to organize production in disaster areas, overcome the famine, and tackle wheat planting issues. After discussions, the following decisions were made: (1) Actively assist the masses in flood control, conduct in-depth investigations of the disaster situation, and mobilize the masses to avoid fleeing the famine as much as possible, or at least to plant wheat before fleeing, otherwise the famine next year will be even more unbearable. (2) Strengthen the relationship between the government and the people, enhance rural unity, and call for the development of a \"people love the people\" movement. (3) Mobilize the masses to collect and store edible wild vegetables, leaves, tree bark, fine bran, as well as grain chaff, grass seeds, hemp seeds, and cottonseed to prepare for the famine, and promote a thrift campaign. Organize the masses to develop sideline production. (4) Systematically eliminate wasteland and plant more wheat, calling for the coordinated use of draft cattle, with cattle from irrigated land lent to those with dry land for plowing, and compensation provided in the form of fodder. After the water recedes, cattle from dry land will help plant wheat in low-lying areas. All land that can be planted must be planted early and extensively. (5) Make every effort to accumulate and apply more fertilizer. If one's own land is flooded and cannot be planted, one can plant wasteland on higher ground. Whoever plants the wasteland gets the harvest and is exempt from rent. (6) Distribute relief loans and funds to support production, overcome the famine, and facilitate wheat planting.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 灾区种麦有困难　城武县府研究解决办法\n\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　灾区种麦有困难\n  　城武县府研究解决办法\n    【冀鲁豫电】城武县水灾严重，全县八个区有六个被淹，全县秋粮平均要减收大半。有的地方满地是水，种麦很成问题，麦种也困难。有的因没吃的要卖牛驴，如果卖了就更影响种麦。种不上麦，灾荒将更严重。为此，该县政府特召集各区干部开会，研究如何组织灾区生产，渡过灾荒和种麦等问题。经大会讨论决定：（一）积极帮助群众治水，深入调查灾情，动员群众最好不逃荒，少逃荒，即便逃荒也必须种上麦子，否则明年的灾荒更不堪设想。（二）密切政民关系，加强农村团结，号召开展“民爱民”运动。（三）发动群众将能吃的野菜、树叶、树皮、细糠及谷秕、草子、麻种、棉子等集藏起来，准备渡荒，开展节约运动。组织群众发展副业生产。（四）有计划的消灭荒地多种麦子，号召调剂使用耕牛，水地牛借给干地的来耕地，可给以草料的报酬。水下去再以干地的牛帮助洼地种麦，凡能种上的地一定要早种多种。（五）想尽一切办法多积肥多施肥，自己的地有水种不上，可种高岗上的荒地，荒地谁种谁收不纳租。（六）发放赈贷粮款扶助生产渡荒和种麦。"

    "content": "\"A True Brother to the Soldiers\"\n　　Loving-Soldier Platoon Leader Tian Guifu\n\tZhang Kerang\n\tComrade Tian Guifu, a meritorious hero of a certain unit's 813th Regiment, 3rd Company, 1st Platoon, is 27 years old this year. He is from Tianjiawan Village in Yuci and worked as a long-term laborer for landlords from a young age, enduring 22 years of hardship. He joined the army in 1944 and the Party in 1946. Since he arrived at the 1st Platoon, especially after the Party rectification, the 1st Platoon has become a model platoon of unity and solidarity. He is recognized by the entire platoon as \"a true brother to the soldiers.\"\n　　Brave and Decisive, He Earns Great Merit in the North and South Shangshe Battles\n\tIn combat, Comrade Tian Guifu has consistently demonstrated bravery, composure, decisiveness, and often secures significant victories with minimal sacrifices. During the battle of North and South Shangshe on May 9th of this year, after the enemy in the river channels was annihilated, his platoon had not yet captured any prisoners or seized any weapons. The company commander ordered him and 2nd Platoon Leader Li Genfu to lead the 1st and 4th Squads, a total of 14 comrades, to annihilate the regimental headquarters of the enemy's 49th Division, 1st Regiment. The enemy numbered over 200, equipped with three heavy machine guns, four light machine guns, and more than ten light cannons, interspersed with rifles and hand grenades, all firing at them. They were suppressed by the enemy's superior firepower. Under his encouragement, a second charge was launched, during which 2nd Platoon Leader Li Genfu heroically sacrificed himself, and two other soldiers were wounded, forcing them to retreat under the enemy's fire. A third charge was launched, but they were again forced back by the enemy's firepower, causing some panic among the soldiers. Comrade Tian Guifu promptly proposed, \"We must eliminate the enemy to avenge our 2nd Platoon Leader!\" He also said, \"Whether from the 2nd Platoon or the 1st Platoon, I will command you all.\" However, they only had about ten hand grenades left. He gathered the hand grenades, reorganized the group, and encouraged everyone, saying, \"We must charge forward and seize the enemy's heavy machine guns and 'Czech hedgehogs'! Comrades, let's go!\" As soon as he finished speaking, everyone charged forward. After using up their own hand grenades, they threw the enemy's hand grenades back at their positions. The enemy began to waver. Coincidentally, friendly forces also pressed forward, and he seized the opportunity to mislead the enemy, saying, \"Look! Aren't those our troops coming from behind? Surrender quickly!\" In that instant, the enemy was thrown into confusion. He led two squads and quickly charged up the hill, defeating the enemy's regimental headquarters, which led to the end of the entire battle. In this battle, he led fourteen comrades (including himself) and, with only three wounded and one dead, defeated the enemy's regimental headquarters of over 200, killing and wounding dozens of enemies, playing a decisive role in ending the entire battle, and earning great merit. During the Jinzhong Campaign, Comrade Tian Guifu continued to demonstrate bravery and tenacity, repeatedly completing arduous tasks, and was awarded another commendation.\n　　Loving-Soldier Platoon Leader, a True Brother to the Soldiers\n\tBecause Tian Guifu has a strong belief in loving the soldiers, in the seven months since the Party rectification, there have been no desertions from Tian Guifu's platoon, and he is recognized by the entire platoon as \"a true brother to the soldiers.\"\n\tTian Guifu is more considerate of soldiers and the wounded than of himself on the battlefield. Before each mission, he always shares the battle plan with everyone and discusses in the squad how to fight and how to complete the mission. Before the Dong Anzhuang battle, he explained the terrain to everyone before the assault. Before the North and South Shangshe battles, they were responsible for guarding Shili Mountain. The squad took turns on sentry duty, and he did not sleep all night. After dawn, when the soldiers were resting, he dug fortifications for an entire morning. He said, \"If we sweat more in peacetime and dig good fortifications, we can avoid being harmed by the enemy's firepower, conceal our bodies, and reduce casualties.\" When the assault began and they were fighting the enemy with hand grenades, Squad Leader Gao Shitang and soldier Wang Wenlin were stunned by the explosions. He immediately went over and told them to take cover. Gao Shitang moved quickly and took cover, but Wang Wenlin hesitated and was wounded. He is even more concerned about the wounded. During the battles before and after the camp, 1st Squad Leader Fan Guihai was seriously wounded in the abdomen. The combat team was scattered, and the enemy was only 30 meters away from Fan. Comrade Tian Guifu led a combat team of the 2nd Squad to retreat. Seeing Fan lying there alone, he had no time to comfort him. He hurriedly took the gun from Fan's hand, resisted the enemy, and called back the 2nd Squad combat team. He used hand grenades and rifles to drive the enemy back, protecting and carrying the wounded soldier away. Later, after Fan Guihai recovered, he said with emotion whenever he mentioned the platoon leader: \"If it weren't for the platoon leader, ten Fan Guihais would have been finished.\" After the troops returned from the Daogou battle, everyone was tired and went to sleep. Four lightly and seriously wounded were carried back to the platoon. Platoon Leader Tian went to see the wounded twice in the middle of the night, fed them water, and comforted them. He said, \"Comrades shed blood for the revolution. We should be more tired.\" In addition to loving the soldiers on the battlefield, he usually pays close attention to improving everyone's military skills, often leading soldiers in research and conducting practical reviews after battles. Wei Guihai did not know how to use a bayonet. He explained, \"We will use bayonets more in the future. If you don't learn, you will suffer.\" He then gave practical instruction and corrected his movements. Liu Erxiao's fortifications were not suitable, so he personally made a model and asked everyone to watch it before doing it themselves. In training, his platoon was the first to create sand table exercises, using spare time to study combat formations, field operations, formation identification, and usage. Because of this, his 1st Platoon often achieved significant victories at a small price in battle.\n　　Consolidating the Troops, Helping the Sick and Injured\n\tComrade Tian Guifu often said, \"Consolidating the troops doesn't just mean no desertions. If soldiers get sick, it also reduces combat effectiveness.\" When the troops were stationed in Jiang Village, his platoon had twelve scabies patients (out of more than twenty in the entire company). Because it was a \"no-man's land\" created by the Yan bandits, they couldn't find an iron pot. He personally found one, gathered firewood, chopped wood, and boiled water. He personally scrubbed the scabies patients with yellow explosives from the enemy's hand grenades. Four days later, when the troops went to Shouxihuang Village and Shanqing to carry out missions, none of the twenty-plus scabies patients were left behind. In Zhonglan, he and the medic突击 treated a dozen more scabies patients. In March, Liu Jincun (a newly liberated soldier) was assigned to the 1st Platoon and had scabies all over his body, especially his neck. He thought, \"The higher-ups sent him to us. Curing him means we have a good soldier.\" At first, Liu was unwilling to be washed, but the soldiers explained it to him, and after repeated persuasion, Liu finally started washing. But washing alone was not enough; he needed to apply medicine to get better. He and the soldiers tried to persuade him for two days and two nights, but they couldn't change Liu Jincun's strange behavior. On the third day, he washed Liu's scabies again. When he had washed to a certain point, he secretly grabbed a handful of yellow explosives and smeared it on Liu's body. Liu Jincun couldn't stand the pain and started cursing: \"This is worse than you killing me with a knife!\" But Platoon Leader Tian didn't get angry. He continued to explain and smear, letting him bake. After three or four times, Liu Jincun's scabies were cured, and he never cursed the platoon leader again. Instead, he said proudly: \"The platoon leader cured my scabies!\" In this way, he personally突击 treated more than fifty scabies patients in the entire company. During the march from the north to the south, Zhang Yongzhen had a stomach ache and hadn't eaten breakfast. He gave his dry rations to the sick soldier, going hungry himself. Chen Sanmao got sick, so he boiled water, cooked food, and washed his body. When he sweated, he found a small room for him to rest in. As a result, he recovered in three days. Chen was also night blind, so Platoon Leader Tian always led him during night marches. Later, he found sheep liver for him to eat and cured him. During marches, he often helped sick soldiers carry their guns and bedrolls. As soon as they arrived at the campsite, while the soldiers rested, he always made sure everyone drank water and washed their feet before going to sleep. At night, he was afraid the soldiers would get cold, so he went to the squad to cover them with blankets, always caring for the soldiers' hardships and health. Therefore, the soldiers often said happily and excitedly: \"Our platoon leader is just like us. He carries more than us on the march!\"\n　　Correctly Grasping Praise and Criticism, Patiently Solving Soldiers' Ideological Problems\n\tHe often called meetings to conduct reviews. He praised those who had merits and conducted individual talks with those who had shortcomings, one after another, until they finally understood the issues. For example, Wang Hantang was liberated from the Zhengtai Campaign last year. His family had been liquidated, and he was in low spirits. He repeatedly explained to him the reasons why poor people had turned over and told Wang: \"Although your family has been liquidated, if you have difficulties, the government will take good care of you.\" Sure enough, a few days later, Wang's family wrote a letter saying: \"Five or six mu of land have been left to the family.\" Platoon Leader Tian then explained: \"When there was more land, the family couldn't farm it all. Although there is less land now, the village will help in every way, and the family's life will definitely not be bad.\" In this way, Wang Hantang's spirits rose. When guarding the post in Chengwu Village, Gao Jifu instigated him to desert. He reported it to the platoon leader. Wang was praised and became more active. He captured a light cannon in the Daogou battle. He played a significant role in attacking the regimental headquarters of the 49th Division in the North and South Shangshe battles, and captured two more small cannons. After the war, he was credited with a minor功. In the Jinzhong Campaign, he volunteered to join the demolition team to blow up Beizhao and completed the task continuously, earning another minor功.\n\tIn order to consolidate his platoon, Comrade Tian Guifu did not relax the principled struggle against some soldiers who repeatedly refused to change despite patient education. After Gao Jifu was exposed for instigating Wang Hantang to desert, he immediately launched a struggle in the entire platoon to provide mass education. Wu Rengong had consistently failed to take care of his weapons. He lost two hand grenades on two trips home and casually slammed his machine gun against the wall. He was not united with the squad leader. Platoon Leader Tian had individual talks with him and criticized him at the squad meeting more than ten times, but he still did not change. After the North and South Shangshe battles, when evaluating merits, he stood aside and just \"giggled.\" The squad leader said he didn't listen, and the platoon leader asked him to sit down several times, but he said indifferently: \"I can't hear what you are saying!\" Finally, at the request of the soldiers, a struggle was launched at the platoon meeting, and he was asked: \"The revolutionary weapons are earned with blood and sweat. Why don't you cherish them? ......\" After the meeting, Platoon Leader Tian did not relax individual education and repeatedly inspired Wu Rengong's self-awareness. He finally realized his mistake, and Platoon Leader Tian immediately helped him formulate a plan to correct his mistakes and make contributions. Wu Rengong changed, and the entire platoon became more united and consolidated.\n\tComrade Tian Guifu loves soldiers, cares for soldiers, and helps soldiers. In the democratic movement, all the soldiers elected him as the consolidation of the troops committee member of the Revolutionary Soldiers Committee, and he was publicly recognized by all the comrades in the platoon as a true brother to the soldiers. At the divisional celebration meeting on August 15th, he wore the big red flower of a meritorious hero. When he spoke, he said: \"I am not worthy of being a meritorious hero. I will work harder in the future and make more contributions!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 爱兵排长田贵福\n张克让\n1948-09-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　“战士的亲兄弟”\n  　爱兵排长田贵福\n    张克让\n    某部大功功臣田贵福同志是八一三团三连一排长，今年廿七岁，榆次田家湾村人，从小给地主扛长工，一直过了二十二年的苦难生活。一九四四年入伍，四六年入党。自他到一排后，特别整党后，一排便成了一个巩固团结的模范排，他被全排公认为“战士的亲兄弟”。\n　　英勇果敢南北上社立大功\n    在战斗上，田贵福同志一贯勇敢沉着，机动果敢，常以小的代价换取大的胜利。在今年五月九日南北上社战斗时，河漕里的敌人被歼灭了，他排还未捉到俘虏缴到枪。连长命令他和二排长李根富同志带一、四班共十四个同志去歼灭敌四十九师一团的团指挥所，敌人是二百多，而且配有重机枪三挺，轻机枪四挺和十余门轻炮，夹杂着步枪、手榴弹一齐向他们打下来，他们被敌人的优势火力压下来了，在他鼓动之下，随着第二次冲锋发起了，二排长李根富同志便在这次冲锋中牺牲了，还有两个战士挂了花，被敌火力压下来。第三次又冲上去，又被敌人的火力压下来，战士们有些恐慌不安，于是田贵福同志及时提出：“咱们一定要消灭敌人，为我们的二排长报仇！”又说：“不管二排的、一排的都由我指挥。”但是他们的手榴弹打的只留下十来颗了，他把手榴弹集中起来，又重新组织了一下，鼓动大家说：“咱们一定冲上去，缴敌人的重机枪、歪把子，同志们上吧！”话刚落地，大家便冲上去了，自己的手榴弹打完，又把敌人投过来的手榴弹打到敌人的阵地上，敌人开始动摇了，恰巧友邻部队也压下来，他便趁机迷惑敌人说：“你们看！后边不是我们的部队都下来了，快缴枪吧！”就在这一刹那时间内，敌人混乱了，他带两个班迅速冲上山头把敌人的团指挥所打垮了，随着整个战斗便解决了。这次战斗，他带领的十四个（连他）同志仅以伤三、亡一的代价打垮了二百余敌人的团指挥所，毙伤敌数十名，对整个战斗的结束起了决定性作用，立了大功。在晋中战役中，田贵福同志仍表现了英勇顽强，屡次完成艰巨任务，又记功一次。\n　　爱兵排长、战士的亲兄弟\n    由于田贵福有坚强的爱兵观点，所以自整党以来七个多月，田贵福排一个逃亡也没有，他被全排公认为“战士的亲兄弟”。\n    田贵福在战场上爱战士爱伤员比自己都周到。每次接受任务后，他总要把战斗方案告给大家，在班里讨论怎样打？怎样完成任务？董安庄战斗在冲锋前给大家讲解地形，在南北上社战斗前，他们在石梨山担任警戒，班里轮流着放哨，他一夜没睡觉，天明后战士们休息，他自己整整挖了一上午工事，他说：“平时咱多流点汗，挖好工事，不受敌人火力杀伤，隐蔽身体，减少伤亡。”冲锋开始，和敌人拼手榴弹时，班长高士堂、战士王文林被手榴弹震呆了，他马上过去叫他们隐蔽，高士堂动作快隐蔽了，王文林稍一呆挂了花。对伤员他更关心，前后营战斗，一班长范贵海腹部负重伤，战斗小组被冲散，敌人离范只有三十米远了，田贵福同志在最后带领二班一个战斗小组撤下来，见范一个人躺在那里，他来不及安慰，忙从范手里拿起枪，一面抵抗敌人，一面喊回二班战斗小组，用手榴弹、排子枪把敌人打回去，掩护着把伤员背下来，以后范贵海休养好了，一提起排长就感动的说：“要不是排长，我十个范贵海也完了。”打草沟部队回来大家都疲劳的睡觉了，排里有四个轻重彩号抬回来，田排长半夜去看了伤员两次，喂他们喝水，安慰伤员，他说：“同志们为革命流了血，咱累点是更应该的。”除战场上爱兵，他平时对大家军事素养的提高很注意，时常领导战士研究，战斗下来即进行实际检讨。魏贵海不会使刺刀，他一面解释说：“今后咱们用刺刀多，学不会就要吃亏。”一面实际教练纠正动作。刘二小工事挖的不适合，他亲自作了个样子，叫大家看了再做。在练兵中，他排首先创造了沙盘演习，利用课余时间研究战斗队形，土工作业，队形识别及使用。由于这样，他带领的一排在战斗中，常以小的代价，换取大的胜利。\n　　巩固部队、帮助病员医疗\n    田贵福同志常说：“巩固部队不光是没开小差的，发生了病号，同样减少了战斗力。”部队住在蒋村时，他排有十二个疥号（全连二十多个）因那里是阎匪造成的“无人区”，找不到铁锅，他亲自给找了一个，找下柴火劈柴烧水，用缴获敌人手榴弹内的黄炸药，亲自给疥号擦洗，四天后部队到寿西黄家庄、山庆执行任务，二十多个疥号都没有掉队。在中兰他又和卫生员突击好十几个疥号。三月里刘金存（解放战士）补到一排，害了满身疥，脖子里满满的，他想：“上级给补充来，治好了就是个好战士。”初给刘洗时，死不愿意，后来战士们也给解释，他再三劝说，刘才洗起来，但光洗不顶事，要擦药才会好，他和战士们说服了两天两夜，也没把刘金存那怪劲扭过来。第三天，他又给刘洗疥，洗到一定时候，他偷偷抓了一把黄炸药抹在刘身上，刘金存耐不住疼，竟骂起大街：“这还不如你拿刀杀了我呢！”但田排长不生气，仍一面解释一面给擦，让他烤，一连三，四次，刘金存的疥好了，以后再也不骂排长了，却洋洋得意的说：“排长给我的疥擦好了！”这样他亲自突击好全连五十多个疥号。部队从北线到南线行军中，张永珍肚子疼，早上也没吃饭，他把干粮让给病号吃，自己饿着。陈三毛病了，他给烧水、做饭、洗身上，出了汗又给找个小屋子养着，结果三天病就好了。陈又是个“夜瞎子”，晚上行军田排长总拉着他，后来又设法找羊肝子吃治好了。行军中他经常帮忙得病战士扛枪、背被包，一到宿营地，战士们休息，他总关心着让大家喝水洗脚后再去睡。晚上他怕战士冻着，到班里给盖被子，处处是关心着战士的疾苦和健康。因此，战士们常是愉快兴奋的讲着：“我们的排长和我们一样样的，行军比我们还背的多哩！”\n　　正确掌握表扬批评、耐心解决战士思想问题\n    他经常召集开会进行检讨，谁有优点就表扬，谁有缺点就接二连三的个别谈话，直到最后搞通思想。如王汉堂是去年从正太战役解放过来的，家里被清算了，情绪不高，他三番五次的给解释穷人翻身的道理，并告王说：“你家里虽然叫清算了，家里有困难，政府一定很好的照顾。”果然隔不几天，王家里来信说：“给家里留下五、六亩地。”田排长随即又给解释：“原来地多时家里种不了，这会虽然地少了，村里一切帮助，家里的生活一定赖不了。”这样王汉堂的情绪就高了起来。在城武村站岗时，郜计福勾引他开小差，他就汇报了排长，王受到表扬更积极了，他草沟战斗缴了一门轻炮，南北上社战斗，攻打四十九师一团指挥所起了很大作用，并又缴小炮两门，战后记了一小功，晋中战役打北赵自报奋勇参加爆炸组，连续完成任务又记了一小功。\n    田贵福同志为巩固他的排，对一些屡经耐心教育不改的战士，并不放松原则性的斗争，郜计福勾引王汉堂开小差被揭发后，他即在全排开展斗争，给予群众性的教育。武仁功一贯不爱护武器，回了二次家丢了两个手榴弹，随便在墙上摔打机枪，和班长闹不团结，田排长和他个别谈话，在班务会上也批评有十次之多但仍未改，南北上社战斗后评功，他站在一旁只管“咯吵”，班长说他不听，排长几次让他坐下，他反满不在乎的说：“听不见你说甚哩！”最后在战士要求下，排务会上开展斗争，向他提出：“革命的武器是流血流汗换来的，你为什么不爱护武器？………………”会后，田排长不放松个别教育，再三启发武仁功的自觉，他终于认识了自己的错误，田排长即帮助他订了改过立功计划，武仁功有了转变，全排更加团结和巩固了。\n    田贵福同志爱护战士，关心战士，帮助战士，在民主运动中全体士兵选他为革命军人委员会的巩固部队委员，并被全排同志公认为是战士的亲兄弟。八月十五日分区庆功大会上，他带上了大功功臣的大红花，他讲话时说：“我当这大功功臣是不够的，今后要再努力，再立功！”"

    "content": "Ta Yue Electric Dispatch: The Donglu Administrative Village work team in Fushan used typical examples from among the masses to persuade them to change their old habits, achieving the application of manure to wheat fields and the mixing of wheat seeds with oil. The soil quality in this village is relatively good, but the customary practice for farming has always been not to apply manure to wheat fields, saving the manure for autumn planting the following year. Recently, when the county work team came to the village to call on the masses to accumulate and deliver fertilizer and to mix wheat seeds with oil, village cadres and the masses all said that wheat fields did not need manure, and oil was too expensive to be worthwhile for mixing with wheat seeds. If manure were applied to wheat fields, there would be no manure for autumn planting, requiring the cutting of artemisia to compost, but the composted grass manure would not be strong, so they all disagreed. After reviewing the situation, the work team immediately went deep among the masses to investigate and discovered that Zhang Fude was good at sweeping the streets to accumulate manure and cutting artemisia to compost, and his crops grew very well, with corn stalks reaching nine feet high, while the average corn stalks were only five or six feet high. Zhang Fude said, \"There is no bad land, only bad manure. The land where my corn stalks are growing so well was fertilized with the artemisia compost from last year.\" The work team used this typical example, first having the Farmers' Association Chairman, Qiao Youde, introduce it to everyone at a cadre meeting. The cadres' thinking changed, and they returned to their respective natural villages, taking the lead in delivering manure to the wheat fields. On the other hand, they began to cut artemisia to compost. Farmers' Association Chairman Qiao Youde delivered 240 dan of manure to the fields and also cut 300 dan of artemisia. At the same time, he promoted Zhang Fude's experience of cutting artemisia to compost everywhere, gradually breaking the habit of not applying manure to wheat fields. On September 7th, various villages reported: Yao Huai, Wang Qing, and others in Juling Natural Village had already composted over 1,000 dan of artemisia manure, and the Dong Shengcai mutual aid group in Ling'er Shang Village had delivered 1,200 dan of manure to wheat fields and composted 500 dan of artemisia. Following this, the work team organized the mixing of wheat seeds with oil. First, they had the experienced old man Xu Lianke promote the benefits of mixing wheat seeds with oil to the masses during a meeting. Mixing wheat with oil is as good as applying manure, making the seeds plump, resulting in a larger harvest, and making the wheat stalks stronger. It can be mixed in the hot season, or mixed at the time of planting. In the hot season, each dou of wheat seeds should be mixed with four liang of oil, and for mixing at the time of planting, three liang of oil is enough. Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil are even better for mixing at the time of planting. At the village production meeting on the 30th of last month, the work team gave a specific introduction to Xu Lianke's method of mixing wheat seeds with oil, especially using Ling'er Shang Village as an example to calculate the costs for the masses: The village has 156 mu of wheat fields, using 6 shi and 4 dou of wheat seeds. Mixing all of it with oil would only require 16 jin of oil. At 2,000 yuan per jin of oil, the total cost would be 32,000 yuan. After mixing with oil, each mu can yield an additional 5 sheng, and 156 mu can yield an additional 7 shi and 8 dou. Each dou can also produce an extra half jin of flour, totaling an extra 390 jin. After this calculation, the cadres of various villages all agreed and took the lead in mixing when they returned to their villages. Ling'er Shang, Donglu Village, Jia Village, Geda Shang, and Juzhen Village have mixed a total of 10 shi and 6 dou of wheat seeds, which can be used to plant 235 mu of wheat. Currently, various villages are continuing to mix seeds.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 用事实教育群众改变旧习　东鲁种麦上粪拌种\n\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　用事实教育群众改变旧习\n  　东鲁种麦上粪拌种\n    【太岳电】浮山东鲁行政村工作组用群众中典型事例说服群众，改变了群众旧的习惯，作到麦地上粪、麦籽油拌。该村土质较好，但历来做庄稼习惯是麦地不上粪，有粪留着明年上秋地。最近县上工作组到村号召群众积肥送粪、油拌麦籽时，村干群众都说麦地用不着上粪，油太贵，拌麦籽不上算。如果把粪上到麦地，秋地就没了粪，必须割蒿来沤，但沤的草粪又不壮，所以都不同意。工作组检讨后，立即深入到群众中访问，发现张福德好扫街积肥，割蒿沤粪，庄稼长得很好，玉菱长得有九尺高，而一般的玉菱只有五六尺高。张福德说：“有烂地没烂粪，我的玉菱地上的就是去年沤下的蒿粪。”工作组就用这个典型事实，先在干部会上由农会主席乔有德向大家介绍，干部思想有了转变，回到各自然村，以身作则，往麦地送粪。另一方面就开始割蒿沤粪。农会主席乔有德把二百四十担粪送到地里，还割了三百担蒿，同时到处宣传张福德割蒿沤粪的经验，逐渐打破了大家麦地不上粪的习惯，九月七日各村汇报：聚粮自然村姚怀、王青等已沤蒿粪一千余担，岭儿上村董盛才互助组已送麦地粪一千二百担，沤粪五百担。接着工作组组织油拌麦籽，先让有经验的徐连科老汉在开会时向群众宣传油拌麦籽的好处，油拌麦，顶上粪，籽儿肥，打的多，麦秆也硬。伏天能拌，随种随拌也能行，伏天每斗拌油四两，随种随拌三两油就行。菜籽油和棉籽油随种随拌更好。上月三十日全村生产会议上，工作组又把徐连科油拌麦籽的办法作了具体介绍，特别以岭儿上村为例，给群众算了一下帐：该村一百五十六亩麦地，用麦籽六石四斗，全部用油拌只用十六斤，一斤油二千元，共需洋三万二千元，油拌后每亩能增产五升，一百五十六亩能多打七石八斗。每斗又能多出半斤面，共多出三百九十斤。这样一计算，各村干部都同意，回村去就带头拌起来。岭儿上、东鲁村、贾庄、疙瘩上、聚畛村共拌了麦籽十石零六斗，可种麦二百三十五亩，现各村还在继续拌种。"

    "title": "Rectify Cooperatives Before Autumn to Welcome Winter's Great Production: Changzhi County Committee Proposes Rectification Methods",
    "author": "Wu Xueshun",
    "date": "1948-09-22",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "(Editor's Note: The Changzhi rectification methods for cooperatives still lack specific and clear solutions to the current major problems of cooperatives and issues regarding business operation guidelines. Although this may solve some problems, it may still be difficult to achieve thorough rectification. We hope the Changzhi County Committee will conduct another in-depth inspection and formulate more specific and comprehensive improvement measures.)\n\n[Taihang News] The Changzhi County Committee has examined and researched the situation of cooperatives in the county and decided to vigorously rectify them, requiring completion before autumn to welcome winter production. The County Committee Secretary made a special report on the methods and steps of rectification at the expanded cadre meeting of the county district on the 24th of last month. The main points are as follows:\n\nThe current situation of cooperatives in Changzhi can be roughly divided into three types: one is those that have been rectified, one is those that are starting to be rectified, and one is those that are half-dead and have not been rectified. The reasons why cooperatives are currently half-dead or even collapsing are as follows: First, the foundation is not solid enough. Most or all of the county's cooperatives were established using the fruits of struggle, without determining the masses' share capital. The masses are not very concerned, and they take things from the cooperatives at will, considering them to be public property. Second, the cooperatives themselves have no rules. There are no rules for personnel establishment, share subscription and withdrawal, profit distribution, and treatment of miscellaneous staff, leading to chaos in the cooperatives. Managers have no power, cadres are unwilling to work, and loans are taken and not repaid, and debts are not repaid. As one district cooperative director said, \"The cooperative has become a relief center for the masses and a supply department for the village public office.\" Third, there is blindness in operation, without organization or planning. There are as many as ten units in one village, including general cooperatives, branches, sub-branches, and small cooperatives, resulting in them all being unable to sell. There are too many people, high expenses, and they are eaten to death. Some engage in speculative buying and selling, resulting in losses that cannot be resolved. Fourth, there has been no clear policy for a long time, with a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. The relationship between county, district, and village cooperatives is not clear enough. They swallow and merge each other, resulting in collapse. Fifth, leadership from the county to the village has not paid enough attention to the cooperatives.\n\nBased on these situations, the following rectification methods are proposed: (1) Settle accounts and distribute profits, discuss democratically, and resolve specific issues. First, resolve the issue of treatment for miscellaneous staff, using a profit-sharing system or a wage system. It is necessary to calculate whether it can match the benefits they would receive at home, and strictly overcome the phenomenon of working for free. In addition, during the account settlement and profit distribution period, a certain amount of profit should be set aside as a bonus for miscellaneous staff. (2) Clear internal and external debts, and overcome the relief viewpoint. Explain that the relief viewpoint in production is destructive to production and reactionary. Do not sacrifice the interests of the majority to cater to the interests of a few, and organize production for repayment. (3) Clearly determine share capital. All share capital that was not determined by the fruits of struggle should be distributed to the masses or, with the voluntary participation of the masses, to determine shareholders and distribute shares. (4) The shareholders' meeting should formally elect a board of directors to supervise the work of the cooperative and establish certain rules. (5) Determine the business direction based on the specific conditions of the village, grasping the principles of organizing production, promoting the sale of local specialties, and selling back the things needed by the village, especially the things needed for production, and strictly overcome the purely profit-seeking viewpoint and speculative buying and selling. (6) Party committees at all levels should pay attention to the leadership of cooperatives and regularly study cooperative work. It is required to complete the rectification before autumn, and in conjunction with the Farmers' Association, formulate a winter production plan and a spring plowing preparation plan for next year.\n\n　　　(Wu Xueshun, County Committee Office)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 秋前整好合作社　迎接冬季大生产　长治县委提出整顿办法\n武学舜\n1948-09-22\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　秋前整好合作社\n  　迎接冬季大生产\n  　长治县委提出整顿办法\n    （编者按：长治关于合作社的整顿办法中，对当前合作社存在的主要问题，业务经营方针问题，解决得仍不够具体明确，这样虽解决部分问题，恐仍难达彻底整顿之目的。希长治县委再次深入检查，定出更具体周详的改进办法来。）\n    【太行讯】长治县委会检查研究了本县合作社的情况，决定大力整顿，要求秋前整完，迎接冬季生产。县委书记在上月廿四日的县区扩大干部会议上关于整顿的方法与步骤，专门作了报告。要点如下：\n    长治现在的合作社情况，大体有三种：一种是已经整顿好的，一种是开始在整顿的，一种是半死不活尚未整顿的。当前合作社半死不活甚至垮台的原因，有以下几种：一、基础不够巩固。全县合作社大部或全部都是用斗争果实成立起来的，没确定群众的股金，群众不大关心，在合作社随便乱取东西，认为是公家的。二、合作社本身没有制度。人员编制、入股抽股、分红、干杂人员待遇等没制度，形成合作社的混乱。经理没有权，干部不愿干，随便借钱不还，赊帐不还。正如一个区联社长说：“合作社成了群众的救济所，村公所的供给部”。三、经营上的盲目性，无组织无计划，有一个村多到十数个单位的，有总社、分社、支社、小型社等单位，结果都卖不了。人员多，开支大，吃垮了。有的买空卖空，结果赔了钱无法解决。四、长期没有明确的方针，单纯营利观点。县区村合作社关系上不够明确，你吞我并，结果垮台。五、由县到村对合作社领导上注意不够。\n    根据这些情况，提出整顿办法：（一）结帐分红，民主讨论，具体解决，首先解决干杂人员待遇问题，用分红制度或工资制度，要计算一下能顶住他在家所得到的利益，严格克服白服务的现象。另外在结帐分红期，抽出一定红利作为干杂人员奖励金。（二）清理内欠和外欠，要克服救济观点，说明在生产中的救济观点是破坏生产的，反动的，不要照顾了少数人利益，损害了大多数人利益，组织生产归还。（三）明确确定股金。凡是用斗争果实没确定的股金，应分给群众或经群众自愿来确定股东分配股票。（四）由社员大会正式选举董事会，负起监督合作社的工作，并规定一定的制度。（五）根据本村具体情况来确定业务方针，掌握原则。组织生产，推销本村特产，贩回本村需要的东西，特别是生产上需要的东西，严格克服单纯营利观点，及买空卖空现象。六、各级党委要注意对合作社的领导，定期专门研究合作社工作。要求秋前整顿完毕，结合农会定出冬季生产计划及明年春耕准备计划。\n    　　　（县委办公室武学舜）"

    "content": "The \"Combat Model\" red flag of a certain unit of the Jinzhong Military Region was planted in the first squad of \"Warrior's Dear Brothers\" Tian Guifu's platoon at the August 15th celebration meeting for meritorious service. Under the leadership of platoon leader Tian Guifu and former first squad leaders Duan Hailong, Fan Guihai, and current squad leader Gao Shidang, this squad has cultivated and promoted two deputy platoon leaders, two squad leaders, and two deputy squad leaders. It has produced major meritorious individuals like Duan Hailong, as well as three meritorious individuals and six minor meritorious individuals (including four who received additional awards).\n\nCombat Model\n\nFrom January to July, in seven months, they carried out fourteen major missions, sacrificing only one person. They captured seventy-five enemies, seized fifty-one rifles, six light machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and four light cannons. Why were they able to achieve great victories at such a small cost? Because they were brave, decisive, good at using combat teams, and organizing firepower.\n\nThey often used combat teams (two) to cooperate with each other and achieve victory in battle. During the battle of Caogou, the combat team led by Gao Shidang, in a critical situation, put forward the slogan \"We must stick together until death.\" First, one team provided cover while the other team climbed onto the house to control the high ground. Unexpectedly, two enemies had already climbed onto the house. They immediately threw grenades that had already been pulled, driving the enemies down, controlling the rooftop, and annihilating a platoon of enemies without any casualties. In the battle of Nanliang in Shouyang, although the enemy was prepared, because of their swift actions, they embraced the enemy sentries, disarmed them, and rushed into the courtyard before the enemies could come out, quickly resolving the battle. In the battle of Shangshe North and South, they successively repelled four counterattacks by the enemy, and destroyed the enemy's regimental command post of more than two hundred men. Before the assault on Beizhao, they covered the leaders while they reconnoitered the terrain. An enemy battalion came out, only one hundred meters away from them. When retreating, they used one team to cover while the other team retreated, completing the mission without any casualties. During the assault on Beizhao, before resolving the battle, the squad leader carried a box of explosives to breach the outer moat. The firepower of the two teams was organized to block the enemy's gun holes. The squad leader pulled the fuse and rushed forward. The enemy threw out a grenade, but he quickly leaned against the bunker, rendering the enemy's grenade ineffective. They picked up two grenades thrown out by the enemy and threw them back into the bunker through the gun holes, inflicting casualties on two of the four enemies, and they occupied the bunker.\n\nUnity and Consolidation\n\nIn ordinary times, the first squad is also a model squad of unity and consolidation. Comrades in the squad help each other and learn from each other. Except for two comrades who have not yet received awards, all the others have received major, meritorious, and minor meritorious awards. Since August of last year, only one person has been sent to the hospital due to illness, three had temporary illnesses, and no one deserted. Why is that? First of all, the squad leader's leadership method is good. They often use praise for good deeds to inspire everyone's enthusiasm. For comrades with ideological problems, they use a democratic approach to discuss them. Li Qingchang and Zheng Shuanglin are the bravest in combat and also work very hard in ordinary times. Li had sores on his body, but did not fall behind during marches, and the squad leader brought it up for praise at the squad meeting, introducing them to inspire everyone. Qiao Shilan, right-leaning and afraid of death, was not sick when eating white flour in the afternoon in Hedong, but when he heard about sweeping utility poles in the afternoon, he said he was sick. After everyone's discussion, he said: \"I am afraid of carrying out tasks, I am not sick, I will not pretend to be sick in the future. I am sorry for everyone, I promise to learn from Wang Hantang and Zheng Shuanglin, and I will strive for meritorious service in the future.\" Li Haiyan was not active in public service, especially in this campaign, when asked to dig fortifications he refused. After criticisms were made on the position, he became active. All the soldiers in the squad strive for progress and talk to each other to help others progress. Yang Shengmao, the leader of their study group, often automatically went to the company headquarters to find \"Victory News\" (military newspaper) and \"Comrade-in-Arms\" to introduce good experiences, models of abiding by discipline and standing firm, etc. When the liberated soldier Li Jincheng first came, he did nothing, but after the squad leader Fan Guihai washed his scabies and applied medicine to cure it, he felt that everyone was very good to him and became active in his work. Qiao Shilan often wanted to ask for leave to go home, so everyone in the squad told the story of \"Xia Yu passing by his house without entering\" and said to Qiao: \"You are from the liberated area, what are you going back for?\" Gradually, Qiao's homesickness was overcome. Wang Hantang (a liberated soldier) had his family settled, and often said strange things. During the party rectification, people called him a landlord, and he was dissatisfied and raised the issue to the squad: \"It's enough if I don't have landlord thinking, don't always call me a landlord.\" After the squad meeting explained, \"As long as you don't have it in your actions and thoughts, don't be afraid of that.\" Later, his mood was high and his position was firm. When Gao Jifu wanted to lure him into deserting, he thought it was wrong and told the squad leader, and launched an ideological struggle against Gao at the squad meeting, letting Gao set out a plan for reform.\n\nEveryone in the squad is united like brothers, not distinguishing between you and me. When Zheng Shuanglin was sick, the squad leader Fan Guihai bought him two catties of pears, and the soldiers pooled their money (five thousand yuan) to buy four ounces of honey. Wang Yuanlin got up in the dark to get a urinal and boil water. When Wang Hantang was sick, the comrades in the squad were afraid that the food prepared by the kitchen would not suit his taste, so they brought things to the squad, and made whatever Wang wanted to eat. Wang Hantang and Zheng Shuanglin said: \"I never want to leave the first squad.\" Therefore, they also won the glorious title of \"Model Squad for Consolidating Troops.\" (Zhang Kerang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 红旗插在第一班\n张克让\n1948-09-22\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　红旗插在第一班\n    晋中军区某部以“战斗模范”的红旗在八月十五日庆功大会上插在了大功功臣“战士亲弟兄”田贵福排的第一班。这班在排长田贵福和原一班班长段海龙、范贵海、现班长高世堂同志领导下，培养和提拔了副排长两个、班长两个，副班长两个，涌现了大功功臣段海龙、及三个立功功臣，六个小功功臣（内有四个功上加功）。\n  　战斗模范\n    一月至七月七个月中，他们执行过十四次主要任务，我仅牺牲一人。俘虏敌人七十五名，缴步枪五十一支，轻机枪六挺，重机枪一挺，轻炮四门。他们为什么能以极小的代价换取大的胜利呢？因为他们英勇果敢，善于使用战斗小组和组织火力。\n    他们经常在战斗中用战斗小组（两个）互相配合取得胜利。打草沟时，高世堂带着的战斗小组，在危急的情况下提出了“咱们要死死在一起”的口号。先以一个小组掩护，一个小组爬上房去控制制高点。不料已有两个敌人爬上房去了。他们即将早已拉出火线的手榴弹打到房上去，把敌人压下去，控制了房顶，歼灭了一个排的敌人，毫无伤亡。寿阳南梁战斗，虽然敌人早有准备，但由于他们动作轻快，把敌人的哨兵抱住，下了武器，冲到院子里敌人还没出来，很快又解决了战斗。南北上社战斗，他们一连打垮了敌人的四次反冲锋。打垮了敌二百多人的团指挥所。北赵攻坚战前，他们掩护首长看地形，敌人一个营的兵力出来，离他们只一百米达了，往回退时，他们以一个组掩护，一个组退，结果毫无伤亡的完成了任务。北赵攻坚，解决战斗前，班长搬了一箱子炸药去爆破外壕，两个组的火器组织起来封锁了敌人的枪眼，班长拉了炸药，先冲上去，敌人打出了炸弹，他很快靠在地堡跟前，使敌人打出来的炸弹无效。他们又拾起敌人打出来的两个炸弹从地堡的枪眼里给敌人打进去，四个敌人伤亡各二，他们进占了地堡。\n  　团结巩固\n    在平时，一班又是团结巩固的模范班。班里同志们互相帮助，互相学习。全班除两个同志没立过功外，其余都立了大功、功、小功。去年八月以来只病送院一人，临时发生病的三人，没有逃亡。他们为什么会这样呢？首先是班长领导方法好，他们常以表扬好的来启发大家的积极性，对思想有毛病的同志，以民主方式大家评。李庆昌、郑双林战斗上最勇敢，平时又很吃苦。李身上有疮，行军不掉队，班长就在班务会上提出表扬。介绍他俩，启发大家。乔石兰，右倾怕死，在河东下午吃白面时还没病，下午听说扫电杆，他就说是病了，经过大家评论后，他说：“我是怕执行任务，没有病，以后我不装病了。对不起大家，保证向王汉堂、郑双林学习，我要争取今后立功。”李海彦公差勤务不积极，特别在这次战役中，叫挖工事不挖，大家在阵地上即开展批评以后就积极了。全班战士都争着进步，又互相谈话帮助别人进步。他们的学习小组长杨生茂同志常自动到连部找“胜利报”（部队报纸）和“战友”给大家介绍好的经验，遵守纪律站稳立场的模范等。解放战士李金成刚来时，什么也不干，但经班长范贵海给他洗疥，抹药，把疥治好后，他感到大家对他很好，工作积极了。乔石兰常想请假回家，大家在班里就讲开了“夏禹治水路过家门不进家”的故事，并说乔：“你是解放区的，回去干甚哩。”逐渐克服了乔的想家思想。王汉堂（解放战士）家里被清算了，常说怪话，在整党中人们都叫他地主，他不满意向班里提出意见：“我没有地主思想就行了，老叫我地主。”经班务会解释“只要自己在行动中，思想中没有了，不要怕那样。”后来情绪高了，立场坚定了，郜计福想勾引他开小差时，他想不对，告诉班长，在班务会上向郜开展了思想斗争，让郜订出改过计划来。\n    大家在班里团结的象亲兄弟，不分你我，郑双林病了时，班长范贵海给买了二斤梨，战士们把自己身上的钱集中起来（五千元）买了四两蜂蜜，王元林黑夜起来给拿尿盆、烧水。王汉堂在病时，班里的同志怕伙房做下的饭不合口味，把东西领到班里，王想吃什么就给做什么。王汉堂、郑双林说：“我永不想离开一班了。”因此他们又得到了“巩固部队模范班”的光荣称号。（张克让）"

    "content": "Strive for Increased Wheat Production Next Year\n  　Zuoquan Launches Manure Accumulation Campaign\n    [Taihang News] In mid-August, the Zuoquan County Party Committee issued a notice calling on everyone to launch a large-scale manure accumulation campaign during agricultural idle time, \"to ensure every household has a manure yard and manure piles everywhere.\" Now, under the leadership of labor heroes and village cadres, a movement has formed in various villages. Zhangba Village in the Third District, after hoeing the village's crops three times, held a production summary meeting on August 28th to discuss manure accumulation work. Team leader Cheng Fuxiang said: \"If we want to harvest more grain next year, we must accumulate more manure now.\" He planned: his team has eight households, eight full laborers, three semi-laborers, and two female semi-laborers. In ten days, they can collect 172 loads of mountain manure, cut 1,000 bundles of artemisia, and compost 30 loads of fertilizer. Each household should accumulate 500 loads. His team's precise plan inspired other teams. Party member Gao Rongxi said, \"Skillful seed selection is not as good as diligently applying manure.\" After the meeting, he negotiated to have the sheep graze on the wheat fields for 30 nights, and all team members mobilized to accumulate manure. Various deputy villages also launched challenges and competitions. Zhangbagou wanted to compete with Wangyangnao, and if the plan was not fulfilled, they would hoe two furrows as punishment. On August 29th and 30th, 112 male full laborers and 12 semi-laborers in the village all mobilized to collect mountain manure and cut artemisia, accumulating a total of 45,880 catties of fertilizer. Village deputy Du Yanchang continued to cut artemisia in the rain. He said, \"Artemisia cut in the rain has high moisture content, decomposes quickly, and generates more heat, so it can compost more fertilizer.\" Woman Du Aiqiao led all the women in the village to cut 30 artemisia stalks a day, carry them back, chop and compost them immediately, and still spin cotton at night. Xin'dian Village in the Fifth District also held a manure accumulation meeting of sixteen mutual aid team leaders after hoeing the seedlings three times. Party member Zhang Youjin went out of the village and arranged for two flocks of sheep (700 in total) to be divided into two pens, plus more than 250 cattle in the village, divided into three pens, changed every five days, and filled in more than 3,000 loads of soil each time. Within twenty days, a total of twenty pens were trampled, yielding more than 77,000 loads of manure. Added to the artemisia cutting, the two items totaled 85,800 loads of compost. There are more than 23,000 mu of land, with an average of 36 loads of manure applied per mu. In addition, if accumulation continues this winter and next spring, the amount will increase to 70 loads per mu next year, striving to increase grain production by one dou per mu next year. Veterans Wang Cunxin and Miao Deyu from Beishang Village cut 9,840 catties of artemisia in seven days. Under their exemplary actions, they inspired the masses of the whole village. The two of them were written up on the village's public bulletin board for their model manure accumulation deeds. Pei Laifu from Caoting Village in the Third District has always been diligent, cultivating 19 mu of land. He hoed the corn three times and the millet twice. Hearing that the government called for manure accumulation, he didn't go to see operas or attend temple fairs, cutting more than 2,000 catties of artemisia and chopping and composting it immediately. When the villagers saw it, they all regretted not going to see the opera. Now, the whole county is carrying out this movement.

    "content": "Editor's Note: The mutual aid team is a production organization, and the team leader's main task is to lead production. In Baicun Village, many administrative tasks are piled on the mutual aid team leader, which greatly affects production leadership. This phenomenon is not unique, and many mutual aid teams have collapsed because of this in the past. This should be closely watched by all localities.\n　　[Taihang Electric] In Baicun Village, Shexian County, the accumulation of fertilizer has been severely unsupervised for a month because the mutual aid team leader has too many tasks and has no time to lead production. The White Dew solar term has passed, and wheat is about to be planted, but the village is still short of two-thirds of the fertilizer needed. At the cadre meeting held at the end of August for all village mutual aid team leaders and above to review this situation, farmers Niu Fubao and Niu Yuhua said: \"Last year's mutual aid was well led by the cadres: distributing life according to labor, doing whatever one could do, and organizing women to participate in production, cutting turf, cutting artemisia, and accumulating a lot of fertilizer. This year, the organization of women's labor is not good, the leadership is poor, and the results are not as good as last year.\" Niu Qiuzi said: \"Strengthening the leadership in the team is right, but I am the mutual aid team leader, the substitute farming team leader, the ward head, the ditch head, and the storage team leader. The cooperative also asks me to collect arrears, and I am also asked to distribute military shoes, which makes me unable to attend to everything. How can I lead the mutual aid well?\" After he said this, four or five teams raised this issue. After inspection and discussion, everyone unanimously proposed that no matter who is the team leader in the future, they should not have too many tasks and should focus on production. Finally, it was decided to quickly solve the problem of mutual aid leadership, adjust cadres, and quickly promote the fertilizer accumulation campaign. On the same night, a mass inspection was carried out in mutual aid groups, which also reflected the seriousness of the above-mentioned problems. As a result of everyone's discussions, it was necessary to adjust the cadres: Mutual aid team leader Yang Duanyuan was appointed as the substitute farming team leader, specializing in leading substitute farming work. Chen Hengchang was appointed as the mutual aid team leader, specializing in leading production. A deputy team leader was also hired. Then, the current production was studied. First, it was decided that the whole team would plant 117 mu of wheat. Based on 16 dan of fertilizer per mu, there was still a shortage of more than 1,700 dan. All male and female full and half laborers must be organized, and whoever can do what should be done, and labor should be used rationally. For example, female full laborers weeding vegetable fields, young children catching insects, male laborers making fertilizer, and old men and women sweeping manure, etc., the plan is to complete it within five days. And put forward the slogan: now compare manure piles, next May compare wheat piles, to encourage the masses to accumulate fertilizer.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 互助组长任务太多　白芟积肥成绩很小\n\n1948-09-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　互助组长任务太多\n  　白芟积肥成绩很小\n    编者按：互助组是生产组织，组长任务主要是领导生产。白芟村把许多行政任务堆在互助组长身上，大大影响了生产领导。这种现象并不是个别的，过去曾因此垮了不少互助组，应该引起各地密切注意。\n    【太行电】涉县白芟村由于互助组长任务太多，没时间领导生产，一个月来的积肥工作严重自流。白露已到，就要种麦，而全村肥料尚差三分之二。八月底召开全村互助组长以上的干部会议对此种情况进行检查时，农民牛福保和牛玉华说：“去年互助，干部领导的好：按劳力分配生活，谁能干啥就干啥，并组织妇女也参加生产，割草皮，割蒿子，积了好多肥。今年没有很好组织妇女劳力，领导差，成绩就不如去年。”牛秋子说：“加强组里领导是对的，就是我一个人担任着互助组长、代耕组长、闾长、渠头儿、又是保管组长，合作社收欠帐也找我，派军鞋也找我，闹得我顾了东顾不了西，那能领导好互助呢？”他这样一说，就有四、五个组都提出这问题。经过检查讨论，大家一致提出：今后不管谁担任组长，也不能任务太多，要以生产为主。最后决定迅速解决互助领导问题，调整干部，把积肥运动很快推动起来。当天黑夜以互助小组开会，进行群众性的检查，也同样反映了上述问题的严重。大家拉扯的结果，要调整一下干部：互助组长杨端元担任代耕组长，专门领导代耕工作。陈恒昌担任互助组长，专门领导生产。又聘请了一个副组长。接着研究了当前的生产，首先订出全组种麦一百一十七亩，每亩按上肥十六担计，还差一千七百余担，必须把男女全半劳力组织起来，谁能干啥就干啥，合理使用劳力。如女全劳力拔菜地草，小儿童捉虫，男劳力造肥，老汉老婆扫粪土等，计划五天内完成。并提出口号：现在比粪堆，明年五月比麦堆，来鼓励群众积肥。"

    "content": "Northern Yue Administrative Office Instruction\n\tVillages Along Rivers Release Silt for Fertilizer\n[Northern Yue Telegram] The Northern Yue Administrative Office issued instructions for increasing fertilizer after the autumn harvest to increase fertilizer. (1) Prepare to carry out silt release work in a planned manner. Decaying plants and animals, scattered manure and urine, and weathered dust from mountains, fields, streets, and courtyards are all high-quality and abundant fertilizers. After being washed away by rainwater, they can be collected to irrigate fields and silt land, replacing fertilizer. The abundance of products on both sides of the Hutuo River in Pingshan and the Sanggan River in Zhuolu is due to silt release. Any river ditch or village can release silt after a rainstorm. It is necessary to carry out silt release work practically and extensively to increase fertilizer and reduce flood damage. Large-scale silt release projects, which are difficult for one county to overcome, will be built by the administrative office or special commissioner's office according to their own strength and technology. Medium-sized silt release projects, which can be organized by one county, will be built by the county and district governments according to their own strength and technology. Small-scale silt release projects, which can be organized by one or several villages, will be built by the villagers according to their own strength and technology. After each rain, the dirty water from ditches and canals in each village can also be used to silt the land. After the autumn harvest, cadres in each county, district, and village should investigate the terrain and water potential, predetermine the size of silt release projects that should be repaired and can be repaired this year, plan labor and funds, and strive to start construction as soon as possible. (2) Call on the masses to raise pigs and sheep, collect manure and pad pens to increase fertilizer. The work of grazing and lying down for sheep flocks should be well organized according to the principle of mutual benefit for both labor and capital. In addition, mobilize the masses to smoke fertilizer and exchange kangs, especially in areas with abundant firewood (such as western Pingxi), where firewood far from the village should be smoked on the spot after the autumn harvest to increase fertilizer. (3) Reward the opening of oil mills and flour mills to produce a large amount of fertilizer. Flour mills and oil mills that have been suspended due to land reform or other reasons should quickly correct deviations and actively support them to restore development, increase production, and increase fertilizer. (4) To achieve the above objectives, cadres working in rural areas should carry out extensive publicity to the masses, lead the masses to increase fertilizer according to the actual situation in each region, overcome the bureaucratic style of empty talk about increasing fertilizer in the past, and lay the groundwork for applying fertilizer and enriching fields to increase income next year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳行署指示　沿河村庄放淤积肥\n\n1948-09-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳行署指示\n  　沿河村庄放淤积肥\n    【北岳电】北岳行政公署为增加肥料，特指示秋后增肥工作。（一）有计划的准备进行放淤工作。山上、地上、街里、院里不断有腐烂的动植物，抛撒的粪尿，风化的尘土，这是质量很好数量极大的肥料，经过雨水冲刷，集中起来可以灌田淤地，代替肥料。平山的滹沱河两岸，涿鹿的桑乾河两岸，所以物产丰富，都得力于放淤。随便那个河沟，那个村庄，雨后的洪水都可以放淤。必须切实而广泛的进行放淤工作，以增加肥料，减少水患。大的放淤工程，一县克服困难，由行署或专署根据本身的力量技术进行兴修。中等放淤工程，一县所能举办的，由县区政府根据本身的力量技术进行兴修。小的放淤工程一村或几村所能举办的，由村民根据本身的力量技术进行兴修。每次下雨后，各村一沟一渠的脏水也可淤地。各县区村干部，应于秋后调查地形水势，预定今年应修而且能修的大小放淤工程、筹划劳力资金，争取早日动手举办。（二）号召群众养猪养羊，拾粪垫圈，以增加肥料。关于羊群的放牧卧地工作，要根据劳资两利的原则好好组织。另外发动群众薰肥换炕，特别是柴草多的地区（如平西），应将离村过远的柴草，于秋后就地薰粪增加肥料。（三）奖励开设油房粉房，大量制造肥料。因土地改革或其他原因而停顿的粉房、油房，均应迅速纠正偏向，积极予以扶助，使其恢复发展，增加生产，增加肥料。（四）为达以上目的，在农村工作的干部，应向群众进行广泛宣传，根据各地区实际情况，领导群众进行增肥，克服以往空喊增肥的官僚主义作风，打下明年上粪肥田增收的准备工作。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-23",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 19th: After the city of Harbin began publicly disclosing Party branches and members in factories, businesses, government organs, and schools, initial experiences from the Harbin Power Plant indicate significant progress in reforming Party members, strengthening ties between the Party and the masses, leveraging the Party's leadership role among the masses, enhancing mass awareness, and increasing production enthusiasm among Party members and the masses.\n\n　　The Harbin Power Plant originally had twelve Party members, most of whom were veteran industrial workers. Except for two young Party members, the remaining ten had over fourteen years of work experience. They possessed proficient skills and enjoyed credibility among the masses. However, before the public disclosure of the branch, due to a lack of practical Party education and other factors, only some Party members played a exemplary role in production, and the overall organizational role of the Party was weak, with many Party members being disconnected from the masses. Consequently, some workers reflected: \"The locomotive runs on its own without telling us about the carriages!\" \"Activists only visit other activists' homes, who speaks for us?\" In order to ensure that the masses had a full understanding of the Party before the branch was made public, the plant first conducted public Party education, explaining what the Communist Party is, who can join the Communist Party, how the Party came to be, the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the Party's current platform and ultimate goals. This emphasized the distinction between the Party and the trade union, and the relationship between immediate and long-term interests. This transformed past misconceptions among the masses, such as \"Communists are all intellectuals\" and \"As long as you are selfless, don't do bad things, and work hard, you meet the requirements for joining the Party.\" During the public Party education process, branch offices were organized within the Party to overcome Party members' ideological concerns about the public disclosure of the Party. Initially, most Party members advocated for \"disclosing good Party members, but not disclosing backward ones\"; some advocated for \"keeping both ends secret (i.e., good and bad members), and disclosing the middle\" to facilitate the collection of opinions from outside the Party. After deliberations through group meetings, branch general meetings, and individual talks, discussing \"what are the benefits of public disclosure of the branch\" and \"how to avoid being disconnected from the masses,\" everyone finally agreed to fully disclose all Party members. During this period, internal criticism and self-criticism were also conducted within the Party, reviewing the work of Party members and the relationship between Party members and the masses. At the branch general meeting, many opinions were raised not only about Party members who usually had many problems, but also about Party members who had been elected as labor heroes and held administrative responsibilities. After several such meetings, it was decided that several Party members with more serious disconnection from the masses should conduct self-criticism at the public branch mass meeting, publicly admitting their shortcomings and expressing their determination to correct them.\n\n　　After the public disclosure of the branch, the masses, seeing Party members publicly criticize themselves and admit their shortcomings, said: \"We always thought Party members were here to supervise us!\" \"Now that Party members are also open, who is good and who is bad, we still need to listen to our opinions, we are truly one family!\" \"The Communist Party says what it means, it doesn't fool people.\" On the Party member side, there was a general feeling that they had to study hard: \"Before the disclosure, we were somewhat lax; now that it's public, the masses often ask this and that.\" Li Xue, the Party member with the most serious disconnection from the masses in the whole plant, whom the masses used to think was \"incurable, even the factory director couldn't criticize him,\" humbly accepted the opinions of the masses after this public disclosure of the branch, and was completely different from before. The phenomenon of activists only visiting activists' homes has decreased, and the phenomenon of the masses only gossiping about Party members' problems behind their backs has also decreased significantly. The masses' concern for the Party has also increased significantly. Many workers have applied to join the Party. Among the first batch of sixteen formal applicants, eight were approved after public discussion by the masses and have been submitted to the general branch for approval according to the procedures for joining the Party. The workers who were accepted into the Party have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. For example, welder Wang Yongqin, who used to seem to work very hard, but only welded two-thirds of an iron frame a day, welded a whole one a day after the masses agreed to his joining the Party and did not even feel tired. Workers who applied but were not approved by the masses after individual education said: \"The Communist Party does not bury good people. I don't meet the requirements now, but if I work hard in the future, I can join the Party soon.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哈市发电厂公开支部  进一步密切了党与群众的关系　提高了群众的觉悟和生产热忱\n\n1948-09-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哈市发电厂公开支部\n    进一步密切了党与群众的关系\n  　提高了群众的觉悟和生产热忱\n    【新华社东北十九日电】哈尔滨市工、商、机关、学校开始公开党的支部和党员后，根据该市发电厂的初步经验，在改造党员、密切党与群众的联系，发挥党在群众中的领导作用、提高群众觉悟、提高党员和群众的生产热忱等方面已收到很大效果。\n    哈市发电厂原有十二个党员，其中大多数都是多年的产业工人，除两个青年党员外，其余十人工龄均在十四年以上；他们有熟练的技术，在群众中有信仰。但在支部公开前，由于缺乏实际的党的教育等原因，只有部分党员在生产中起了模范作用，整个党的组织作用很弱，许多党员脱离群众。因此，有的工人反映说：“火车头开动时光自己跑，也不告诉我们火车箱！”“积极分子家里跑，谁说咱们？”为了在支部公开前使群众对党有充分的认识，该厂首先进行公开的党的教育，说明什么是共产党，什么人才可以加入共产党，党是怎样来的，党与群众的关系，党的目前主张与最高纲领等；其中并着重说明党与工会的区别，目前利益与长远利益的关系。这样，使群众中间过去存在着的“共产党尽是知识分子”、“只要大公无私、坏事不干，好好干活就够入党条件”等错误认识有了转变。并在公开党的教育过程中，党内组织了分支部，克服党员对公开党的思想顾虑。最初多数党员都主张“公开好的党员，落后的不要公开”；有的主张“两头秘密（即好与坏的秘密），中间公开”，以便容易收集党外的意见。经过小组会、分支部大会及个别谈话酝酿，讨论了“支部公开有什么好处”、“怎样才能不脱离群众”，最后，一致同意了党员全部公开。在这期间，同时展开了党内的批评与自我批评，检讨党员工作和党员与群众的关系。在分支部大会上，不仅对平时毛病很多的党员，而且也对当选为劳动英雄及负行政责任的党员提了很多意见。经过几次这样的会议，大家决定，脱离群众比较严重的几个党员要在公开支部的群众大会上作自我批评，当众承认自己的缺点，并表示改正的决心。\n    支部公开后，群众见党员当众自我批评，承认缺点，都说：“在早总以为党员是来监督咱们的！”“而今党员也公开了，谁好谁坏，还要听听咱们的意见，真是一家人了！”“共产党有啥说啥，真不唬弄人。”党员方面，则普遍感到非好好学习不成：“在早没公开，有些马马虎虎；现在公开了，群众经常问这个，问那个。”全厂脱离群众最严重的党员李学，过去群众认为他“没法治，厂长也批评不了他。”这次支部公开后，李学虚心接受群众意见，与前大不相同。从前积极分子光到积极分子家中串门的现象已经减少，群众对党员的毛病光在背地里叽咕的现象也很少了。群众对党的关心也显著提高，很多工人纷纷要求入党，第一批正式申请的十六人中，经过群众公议通过八名，已按入党手续送交总支批准。被接受入党的工人，生产情绪大大提高。如电焊工人王永勤，过去看来干得很卖力气，但一天才焊一个铁房架子的三分之二，群众公议同意其入党后，一天焊一个整的还不嫌累。报了名没有被群众公议通过的工人，经个别教育后说：“共产党不埋没好人，我现在不够条件，今后好好干也能很快入党。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 19th, TASS New York, September 14th: In recent weeks, American newspapers have reflected the anxiety of some important business figures regarding the American economic situation. The New York Herald Tribune's financial observer stated: \"In many quarters, a considerable degree of unease and doubt prevails regarding the economic outlook.\" The Citibank Bulletin admitted: \"The cost of living is oppressively felt,\" and \"People are eager for relief.\" The bulletin continued: \"Entrepreneurs are uneasy about the economic situation; they fear that the longer the boom lasts, \"the greater the reaction will be.\" Various articles in business and economic publications point out these weaknesses in the current situation: (1) The current high levels of production, employment, and prices are artificially created by military orders and Marshall Plan expenditures; (2) The high cost of living is suppressing living standards, thereby shrinking the domestic market; (3) Despite the injection of the Marshall Plan, export markets are in decline; (4) The cost of new factory equipment shows a downward trend; (5) Certain industrial sectors have shown signs of \"overproduction\" and have already begun to reduce work. According to the Federal Reserve Board's recent estimates, industrial production declined in July and partially recovered in August. The industrial production index for July was 187, compared to 192 in June (based on the average of 1935-39). The Department of Commerce reported that the total inventory of manufacturers in June reached $29.8 billion, an increase of $400 million in one month. Labor Department statistics conservatively state that the cost of living in July increased by 30.3 percent compared to June 1946, when price controls ended, and by 76.2 percent compared to August 1939. \"The New Republic\" magazine wrote regarding rising prices: \"The simple but unpleasant explanation is that we have reached the point where the business community finds it more profitable to cut production than to lower prices.\" \"The New Republic\" magazine pointed out that total corporate after-tax profits this year will reach a new record of $20 billion, four times that of 1939. Statistics from the Federal Trade Commission and other government agencies reveal that profits are increasingly concentrated in the hands of the largest companies. The export situation is beginning to cause some concern. In the first half of this year, total U.S. exports, including Marshall Plan materials, totaled $6.7 billion, a decrease of 17 percent compared to the first half of last year. If price increases are taken into account, this indicates a decrease of more than 20 percent in the quantity of exports. While exports are declining, U.S. imports in the first half of this year increased by 20 percent compared to the same period last year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国内及输出市场都在衰退　美经济情势使资本家焦虑\n\n1948-09-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国内及输出市场都在衰退\n  　美经济情势使资本家焦虑\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社纽约十四日讯：最近几周来，美国报纸上反映着某些重要企业界人士对美国经济情势的焦虑。纽约先驱论坛报金融观察家说：许多方面人士对经济的前景流行着相当程度的不安和怀疑。花旗银行公报承认：“生活费用令人感到压迫”，“人民渴望减轻”。公报继称：企业家对景气感到不安，他们害怕景气的时间愈久，“反响就更大”。企业与经济刊物上的各种论文指出目前情势的这些弱点：（一）目前的生产、就业和物价的高水平，是军事定单和马歇尔计划开支所人为地造成的；（二）生活费用的高涨压抑着生活标准，从而缩小国内市场；（三）尽管有马歇尔计划的注射，输出市场已在衰退；（四）新工厂装备的费用显出下降的趋势；（五）某些工业部门已显露出“生产过剩”的迹象，已经开始减少工作。据联邦储备局最近的估计，工业生产七月份已下降，八月份有部分的恢复。七月份工业总生产量指数为一八七，六月份为一九二（按系以一九三五至三九年的平均数为基数）。商务部报告说：六月份制造家的存货总数达二百九十八亿元，即一个月内增加了四亿元。劳工部统计数字保守地说明：七月份生活费用较物价管制结束时的一九四六年六月增加了百分之三十点三，较一九三九年八月增加了百分之七十六点二。“新共和”杂志论及物价上涨时写道：“简单但不愉快的解释，就是我们已经达到这样的地步：企业界发现削减生产比降低物价更为有利。”“新共和”杂志指出：公司纳税后的利润总数今年将达二百亿元的新纪录，为一九三九年的四倍，联邦贸易委员会和其政府机关的统计透露利润愈来愈集中在最大的公司手中。输出的情形开始引起某些关心，今年上半年美国总输出，包括马歇尔计划物资在内，共计六十七亿元，即较去年上半年降低百分之十七，如算上物价的上涨，则表示输出的数量下降百分之二十以上，一方面输出下降，另一方面，美国的输入今年上半年比去年同一时期增加百分之二十。"

    "content": "Note: Zachariadis is 48 years old this year and was born in Adrianople. He is one of the founders of the Greek Communist Party and formed the first Greek communist group in Constantinople. In 1931, Zachariadis was elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and served as the secretary of the Balkan Bureau. In the struggle against the fascist royalist government, his footprints were all over Greece, sometimes commanding the war in the Grammos Mountains, and sometimes appearing in Athens.\n　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th】TASS Belgrade, 16th: Free Greece Radio broadcasted an article by the Secretary-General of the Greek Communist Party, Zachariadis, entitled \"The People Are on the Offensive.\" In discussing the recent Greek battles, Zachariadis emphasized that, militarily, the royalist fascists and their Anglo-American masters have suffered a complete defeat. They have not only failed to eliminate, but even failed to weaken, the Greek Democratic Army north of the Pindus Mountains. On the contrary, the Democratic Army, due to the courageous actions taken from August 20th to 21st, thwarted the enemy's plans and absolutely changed the situation. On September 16th, in the two regions of Vitsi (in the far north of Greece) and Murggana (in Epirus), the royalist fascist troops were in a difficult situation that they had never seen before. The royalist fascists' military plans in other parts of Greece have also completely failed miserably. In Thessaly, Romilia, the Peloponnese and other regions, the Democratic Army is strengthening its troops, expanding and consolidating the liberated areas, creating an extremely serious situation for the enemy. The article explained that the royalist fascists have received unlimited support from Anglo-American imperialism, and their failure is due to the fact that the Athens group has no prestige among the working people, and the working people know that the United States is the real master of the reactionary ruling area of Greece. In order to cover up their losses, the royalist fascists are carrying out provocations and creating armed incidents on the borders of the People's Democratic Republics to the north. For example, with the assistance of the so-called United Nations Balkan Committee, they are opening the way for imperialist military intervention. These provocations mean that the royalist fascists openly admit that they are unable to resist the Democratic Army. Now, the Democratic Army is using its actions to show that they will give the strongest resistance to the plans of domestic and foreign reactionaries. Zachariadis concluded by saying: \"We will force the enemy to submit, and we guarantee that the policy reflecting the interests of the Greek people will be victorious.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 希共总书记论战局：  民主军的胜利绝对的改变了局势　现正加强部队扩大与巩固解放区\n\n1948-09-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　希共总书记论战局：\n    民主军的胜利绝对的改变了局势\n  　现正加强部队扩大与巩固解放区\n    按：萨查利阿第斯今年四十八岁，生于亚得里亚堡。他是希共创始人之一，曾在君士坦丁堡组成希腊的第一个共产党小组。一九三一年，萨查利阿第斯当选为共产国际执行委员，并担任巴尔干局书记。在反对法西斯保皇政府的斗争中，他的足迹遍于希腊各地，时而在格拉姆斯山区指挥战争，时而在雅典出现。\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社贝尔格莱德十六日讯：自由希腊电台广播希共总书记萨查利阿第斯题为“人民在进攻中”的文章。在论及希腊最近的战事时，萨查利阿第斯着重指出，在军事方面，保皇法西斯及其英美主子已遭受完全的失败。他们不仅未能消灭、甚至未能削弱平都斯山北部的希腊民主军。相反，民主军由于自八月二十日至二十一日实行了果敢的运动，挫败了敌人的计划，而且绝对的改变了局势。九月十六日，在维齐（在希腊极北部）和姆尔加那（在艾匹鲁斯）两地区，保皇法西斯军队陷于他们前所未见的困难局势中。保皇法西斯在希腊其他地区的军事计划也已完全惨败。在色萨利、罗米利亚、在摩里亚半岛及其他地区，民主军正在加强其部队，扩大与巩固解放区，造成对敌极为严重的形势。该文解释称，保皇法西斯得到英美帝国主义的无限支持，其失败是由于雅典集团在劳动人民中没有威望，劳动人民知道美国才是希腊反动派统治区真正的主宰。保皇法西斯为了掩饰他们的失利，乃对北面邻邦人民民主共和国边界上进行挑衅和制造武装的事件。例如，在所谓联合国巴尔干委员会的协助下，他们为帝国主义军事干涉开辟道路。这些挑衅，意味着保皇法西斯公开承认他们无力抵抗民主军。现在，民主军以其行动表明他们对国内外反动派的计划予以最坚强的抵抗。萨查利阿第斯结语称：“我们必将迫使敌人屈服，我们保证反映希腊人民利益的政策获得胜利。”"

    "content": "Neglecting Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting\n  　Inevitably Leads to Detachment from the Masses\n  　Taihang Xinhua Daily Publishes Editorial\n    [Taihang Electric] Since the Taihang District Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres above the county level in August, the leadership of autumn harvest and autumn planting has been generally neglected in the execution of this year's autumn and winter work guidelines in various parts of Taihang. The Xinhua Daily here has published an editorial on this matter. The editorial points out that in early August, the District Party Committee convened a meeting of cadres above the county level to determine the work guidelines for this autumn and winter, mainly to conclude land reform, rectify the Party and build political power, develop production, and support the front lines. In terms of specific steps, after cadres went to the countryside, the first thing was to lead the autumn harvest and autumn planting, rectify cooperatives, and at the same time conduct investigations and research to prepare for the conclusion of land reform and the conduct of Party rectification. However, judging from the situation in various counties since the August meeting, apart from some counties that correctly implemented the work guidelines of the District Party Committee and determined correct specific methods, many counties have deviations. The performance in the implementation of the policy is generally focused on concluding land reform and rectifying the Party and building political power, and only made general calls for autumn harvest and autumn planting, without specific organizational arrangements, and some even did not mention it at all. Some counties deployed and discussed the resolutions of the August meeting using an egalitarian approach, without making specific arrangements based on the specific circumstances of the county and the priorities in the work. In the work arrangements before autumn, in order to buy time to end the land reform, many counties relatively neglected or even abandoned the leadership of the autumn harvest and autumn planting. In addition to checking the reasons for not correctly implementing the policy of the District Party Committee, the leaders of various counties should also recall the experience and lessons learned from abandoning the leadership of spring plowing and production during the land reform and Party rectification experiment this spring.\n    In order to correct this deviation in a timely manner, the simple task viewpoint and the phenomenon of impetuosity in ending land reform must be overcome ideologically. We must deeply understand the first item of the Central Committee's instructions on land reform and Party rectification work in 1948: \"Must pay attention to the season.\" The six characters, \"must pay attention to the season,\" if the current autumn harvest and autumn planting are affected by the end of land reform, it must be detached from the masses, causing great obstacles to future work. Those who believe that autumn harvest and autumn planting do not need leadership and that the masses will naturally do it should recognize that if autumn harvest and autumn planting, especially autumn planting, are not done well, it will be a serious harm to next year's large-scale production campaign. Therefore, all localities should put their cadre strength into leading production and shorten the time for autumn harvest and autumn planting; at the same time, conduct investigations and research, discover problems, and widely and correctly publicize the policies of ending land reform and democratic Party rectification, and dispel the ideological doubts of cadres and the masses. If this preparatory work is done well, after the victorious conclusion of autumn harvest and autumn planting, the conclusion of land reform and Party rectification will be carried out smoothly and universally.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 忽视秋收秋耕　必然脱离群众　太行新华日报发表社论\n\n1948-09-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　忽视秋收秋耕\n  　必然脱离群众\n  　太行新华日报发表社论\n    【太行电】太行各地自八月区党委召开县以上干部会议后，在执行今年秋冬工作方针上，普遍忽视秋收秋耕的领导。此间新华日报特为此发表社论。指出：八月上旬区党委召开县以上干部会议，确定今年秋冬工作方针，主要为结束土改、整党建政、发展生产、支援前线。在具体步骤上，干部下乡后，第一件事就是领导秋收秋耕，整顿合作社，同时调查研究准备结束土改与进行整党。但从八月会议后各县情况看，除有些县份正确的贯彻了区党委的工作方针，确定了正确的具体作法以外，不少县份存有偏差。表现在对方针的贯彻上一般是着重了结束土改和整党建政，对秋收秋耕只作了一般的号召，没有进行具体的组织布置，有的甚至根本没有提。有的是将八月会议的决议用平均主义的办法去布置与讨论，没有根据县的具体情况和工作中的轻重缓急去具体安排。很多县份在秋前的工作布置上，为了争取时间结束土改，对秋收秋耕便相对的忽视了甚至放弃领导。这种做法，各县领导上除应检查没有正确的贯彻区党委的方针的原因外，并应回忆今春在土改整党实验中，放弃春耕生产领导的经验教训。\n    为了及时纠正这种偏向，在思想上必须克服结束土改中的单纯任务观点与急性病现象，要深刻领会中央关于一九四八年土改整党工作指示的第一项“必须注意季节”六个字，如因结束土改而影响了当前秋收秋耕，必须脱离群众，给今后工作造成很大的阻碍。认为秋收秋耕不用领导，群众自然会做的自流论者，要认识秋收秋耕特别是秋耕搞不好，对明年大生产运动将是个严重的危害。因此各地应把干部力量放到领导生产上来，缩短秋收秋耕的时间；同时进行调查研究，发现问题，广泛的正确宣传结束土改民主整党等政策，解除干部群众的思想疑问，这个准备工作做好，秋收秋耕胜利结束之后，即会顺利的普遍进行结束土改与整党建政。"

    "content": "The Terrifying and Chaotic Taiyuan City\n　　Ma Ming\n　　In the past month, under the mighty victory of the People's Liberation Army in the Jinzhong Campaign, the Yan bandit, entrenched in the isolated city of Taiyuan, is filled with panic and despair. As the People's Liberation Army approached the suburbs, and the sound of cannons shook the city, high-ranking officials and their families scrambled to \"fly\" to Peiping and Tianjin to escape. Fearing that our army would attack the city, they forced the masses in Chenjia Yu, Yangjia Yu, and other villages in the east of the city to crawl on the ground day and night, listening for any sounds of tunneling. The entire city was placed under martial law with increased sentry posts. Police, security, and secret agents roamed the streets. Anyone entering the city needed to find two lieutenant colonels to vouch for them or hold a certificate from the city defense headquarters. At night, the street lights were dim and sparse, and people were fearful, as if in a dead city. Staff members of the Pacification Headquarters were restless day and night, losing confidence in the city wall fortifications: \"All this busywork is in vain!\"\n　　In order to save this last nest, the Yan bandits have been plundering goods and property on a large scale and strengthening their \"defenses.\" All civilian materials that could be used for construction or weapon manufacturing, such as stones, bricks, tiles, wood, steel, iron, and machinery, are being \"requisitioned\" or \"borrowed.\" They forcibly seized citizens to rush to build an airport in the northwest corner of the city, frantically declaring that they would not hesitate to demolish more than 720 civilian houses. After being opposed by the citizens, they stopped halfway and changed to building it outside the South Gate. Fearing that the civilian houses and autumn crops inside and outside Zhengtail Street and Qifeng Street outside the new South Gate would be used by our army for attacking the city, the bandit army hurriedly demolished and harvested all civilian houses and autumn crops within forty meters. At the same time, they ordered all students, clerical staff, and citizens aged sixteen to thirty-seven to be organized into \"Student Divisions,\" \"Clerical Staff Divisions,\" and \"Civilian Defense Forces,\" respectively. Workers were organized into groups of three, and those of appropriate age were extracted to form \"Worker Divisions,\" with the vacancies being filled by young women. More than 300 women were organized into \"Armed Self-Defense Teams,\" all of whom were issued firearms and military uniforms, forcing them to die for the Yan bandits. In particular, the three massacres directed by the special agent chief Liang Huaizhi last month are unforgettable for the citizens. More than 130 innocent citizens and workers who were arrested by the \"Special Police and Security Command\" (Liang was the director) were falsely accused of \"disguise\" and were brutally buried alive or shot outside Hanximen, Xinnanmen, and Xiaodongmen.\n　　Under the Yan bandits' massacres, plunder, demolition of houses, and soaring prices, the vast majority of citizens have fallen into a desperate situation of hunger, terror, and homelessness. They dare not look up when speaking (fearing being accused of \"disguise\"), and dare not walk close to the wall (fearing being accused of posting slogans for the Eighth Route Army). Currently, those who can swallow \"Pingjing flour\" (actually bran flour), bean cakes, and bitter herbs have become the middle class. Citizens whose houses were demolished on Zhengtail Street and Qifeng Street are living in makeshift shelters by the roadside, weeping under the rain, and there are many beggars and disabled people cast out by the Yan bandits wandering the streets. Robberies are constantly occurring at food stalls on the streets. Cases of jumping into wells, hanging, and taking poison are frequently heard. After a wealthy family near the Lüzu Temple was looted, seeing that they had no means of living, the woman sewed the only remaining gold ring into her child's clothes and committed suicide by taking poison while the child was out. Not only that, but the citizens are still forced to engage in indefinite \"voluntary labor\" while hungry. Last year alone, the labor \"requisitioned\" amounted to 607,700 workdays. No one knows how many adults starved to death or infants miscarried during the construction and in the rubble. Even the Yan bandits' middle and lower-ranking officials have suffered from hunger since the \"family rations\" were stopped.\n　　The Yan army issues only two liang of flour per day, and the soldiers are constantly suffering from famine. Military morale is wavering, and desertion is rampant. According to the registration at one of our reception stations in a certain area alone, there are already more than 200 people. The defeated bandits, shrinking in the suburbs, rob and kill residents everywhere. Most of the villages in the eastern and southern suburbs have been looted several times. In Xiaojingyu, Jiajie, and Xiazhuang alone, eight people, including village chiefs and secretaries Wen Benhe, have been killed.\n　　The people inside and outside Taiyuan, who are in deep water and scorching fire, can no longer live. Although the Yan bandits frantically shouted at the \"Defend Taiyuan\" mobilization meeting, \"We must annihilate the Communist army under the city of Taiyuan,\" the citizens firmly believe, \"Yan Xishan is finished. He only loses and never gains. Taiyuan cannot be defended either.\" The villagers in the suburbs are crying and telling about the Yan bandits' crimes and anxiously asking everywhere, \"When will the city be attacked?\" They place all their hopes on the early liberation by the People's Liberation Army.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 恐怖混乱的太原市\n马明\n1948-09-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　恐怖混乱的太原市\n    马明\n    一月来，在解放军晋中胜利威震下，困踞太原孤城之阎匪，充满慌乱和悲观绝望。当解放军逼近城郊，炮声震撼市内外时，高级官员家眷争抢“飞”往平、津逃命。唯恐我军攻城，迫令城东陈家峪、杨家峪等村群众昼夜爬伏地下，听取有无挖地道声音。全市戒严增设岗哨，街上警宪特务横行，任何人进城，需找两个中校保或者持有城防司令部证明。入夜则路旁电灯暗淡稀疏，人心惶恐，有如死城。绥署参谋人员日夜坐卧不安，对城垣工事丧失信心：“白忙一起，徒劳无功”！\n    阎贼为挽救这座最后巢穴，大肆掠夺商品财物和加强“防务”。凡民间一切可供作工事、武器制造的石头、砖、瓦、木材、钢、铁、机器等均在“征用”“征借”之列。强抓市民在城内西北角赶修飞机场，狂叫不惜拆毁民房七百二十余处，遭到市民反对后，始中途停止改到南门外修筑。匪军又唯恐新南门内外正太街、起凤街之民房秋禾为我军攻城所利用，竟急忙将四十公尺以内之民房秋禾悉数拆光割尽。同时勒令凡年在十六岁至三十七岁的学生、机关杂务人员及市民均分别编为“学生师”、“杂务人员师”、“民卫军”。工人则三人编一组，适龄者抽出编为“工人师”，遗缺迫使青年妇女补充。三百余妇女被编“武装自卫队”，一律发以枪械军装，迫使为阎贼送命。尤其上月特务头子梁化之一手导演的三次大屠杀，更为市民永远不能忘记，先后被“特种警宪指挥处”（按梁任处长）逮捕之一百三十余无辜市民、工人，被诬加“伪装”罪名，在旱西门、新南门、小东门以外惨遭活埋枪杀。\n    广大市民阶层在阎匪屠杀、掠夺、拆房加以物价狂涨下，普遍陷入饥饿、恐怖和无房无衣的绝境，说话不敢抬头（怕说成“伪装”），走路不敢靠墙（怕说成给八路军写贴标语），目前能吞食“平经面粉”（实则糠面）豆饼和苦菜者已成中产阶级了。正太街、起凤街被拆毁住房的市民，群给含泪露宿于马路旁席棚阴雨下叫苦连天，流浪街头的乞丐及阎匪赶出残废人员甚多。大街食摊上不断发生争抢事件。跳井、悬梁、服毒自杀者时有所闻。吕祖庙附近某富家被掠夺精光后眼看生活无着，其女人将仅余之金戒指缝入小孩衣服，乘小孩外出服毒自杀。不仅如此，市民们饿着肚子仍被迫从事无期限的“义务劳动”。仅去年作工即“征用”六十万七千七百个工。不知多少大人饿死或婴儿小产在作工事和乱石中，就连阎贼的中小官员们自停发“眷粮”以后，亦饱尝饥饿之苦。\n    阎军每日发斤二两面，士兵整日闹饥荒，军心动摇，逃风日甚，仅我某地一处招待所登记者，已有二百余人。龟缩于市郊溃匪，四出抢劫，抓杀居民，东、南市郊各村大部被洗劫数次，仅小井峪、嘉节、下庄等数村，即杀死村长书记温本和等八人。\n    处于水深火热中的太原市内外老百姓，已再无法生活下去，尽管阎贼在“保卫太原”动员会上狂叫：“要消灭共军于太原城下。”但市民们却坚信：“阎锡山完啦，只见丢不见收，太原也保不住。”城郊老百姓则纷纷哭诉阎匪罪行并着急的到处打问：“什么时候攻城？”他们把一切希望寄托在解放军早日解救他们。"

    "content": "Restore Production and Eliminate Wasteland\n  　Qixian New District Expands Wheat Fields\n    [Jinzhong Electric] White Dew has passed, and it is the season for planting wheat. Party, government, and civilian cadres in Qixian are making every effort to mobilize the masses in the Qixian area to restore production and expand wheat fields by 200,000 mu. The new district aims to restore the acreage of wheat fields to the level before Yan's bandits implemented the so-called \"soldier-peasant integration,\" while the old district aims to reach the 1946 wheat planting level, ensuring that each person plants two to two and a half mu of wheat. To solve the difficulties of the masses in the new district in planting wheat, the democratic government has allocated a special loan of 4 million and 100 dan of seeds, to be distributed to the 3rd, 5th, and 6th districts, which were the most severely looted by Yan's bandits. Currently, cadres in various districts have gone deep into the countryside to mobilize the masses, adjust land, and strive to complete the arduous task of expanding wheat planting as soon as possible.\n    [Jinzhong Electric] The broad masses in the newly recovered areas on both sides of the Tongpu Road South Baijin Line in Qixian County, after abolishing Yan's bandits' \"soldier-peasant integration\" and regaining the right to cultivate their own land, are actively engaged in restoring production and rebuilding their homes. In the Zi Hongkou Liuhegou area of the former Second District, under the brutal rule of Yan's bandits for less than half a year, a large amount of land was deserted, with over 15,000 mu of cultivated land and 10,200 mu of uncultivated land lying fallow. Farmers who had been robbed and scattered before have successively returned to production and rushed to plant crops and settle their families. The democratic government has helped them solve the problems of means of production and livelihood, and people from all walks of life have displayed their enthusiasm for labor and have begun to cultivate the barren land. Farmers in Liang Village praised the People's Liberation Army and thanked the democratic government as soon as they picked up their rice bowls, saying, \"If the local emperor (referring to Yan's bandits) hadn't been overthrown, how could us ordinary people have food to eat?\" \"When Yan's bandit army was around, the grain harvested belonged to them, and the faces of the people were all yellow. Since the People's Liberation Army came, the grain harvested belongs to us, and the wives and children are all rosy-cheeked.\" In a short period of time, the masses in Liang Village rushed to plant 120 mu of naked oats and eliminated 138 mu of wasteland. The masses in the entire district put forward the slogan \"The front eliminates Yan Xishan, the rear eliminates wasteland,\" mobilizing men and women to eliminate wasteland and replant late crops in large quantities. According to statistics from 16 villages in the Second District, a total of 2,380 mu of naked oats and 1,040 mu of millet were replanted, and more than 1,800 mu of wasteland was eliminated. The masses in this district have a tradition of mutual aid labor and have confidence in restoring production and rebuilding their homes. They said, \"Our land is very rich, and with the leadership of the democratic government, it will be turned around in less than two years.\" Women and children in many villages have all set out to pull up weeds and prepare to expand wheat planting. The waterlogged land in Gaobei Village has now been plowed twice, more than 80% of the wheat fields in Shentangtou and Wanglianzhuang have been plowed, and more than half of the land in the 20 villages of Sunjiahe in Wuhezhuang has been plowed. After the democratic government promulgated measures to reward reclamation, the masses in the entire district are mobilizing all full and semi-labor forces to focus on planting wheat, preparing to eliminate 10,000 mu of wasteland. The democratic government also guarantees the safety of life for those fugitive landlords who were afraid of struggle during the land reform in the border areas in the past after they return home, and distributes land to them, so that they can settle down and produce.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 恢复生产消灭荒地　祁县新区扩大麦田\n\n1948-09-23\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　恢复生产消灭荒地\n  　祁县新区扩大麦田\n    【晋中电】白露已过，正是种麦的季节。祁县党政民干部正以全力发动祁区群众恢复生产，扩大麦田二十万亩。新区要恢复阎匪实行所谓“兵农合一”以前的麦田亩数，老区达到一九四六年种麦水平，作到每人种麦二亩到二亩半。为解决新区群众种麦困难，民主政府特拨贷款四百万，种子一百石，分发给遭阎匪抢掠最重之三、五、六区。现各区干部已深入农村发动群众，调剂土地，争取早日完成扩大种麦的艰巨任务。\n    【晋中电】祁县同蒲路南白晋线两侧广大新恢复区群众，在废除了阎匪的“兵农合一”重新获得耕种自己土地的权利以后，正积极从事恢复生产重建家园。原二区子洪口六合沟一带农民，在阎匪横暴统治下未及半年，土地大量荒芜，熟荒达一万五千余亩，生荒一万二百亩。以前被劫逃散的农民，相继归来生产抢种，安置家务。民主政府帮助他们解决生产资料与生活资料，各阶层群众发扬劳动热忱，开始在荒芜的土地上进行耕种。梁村农民一端起饭碗就拥赞解放军，感激民主政府说：“要不打倒了土皇帝（指阎匪），咱老百姓还能有饭吃？”“阎匪军在时打下粮食是人家的，老百姓脸都是黄腊腊的，解放军来了，打下粮食是自己的，婆姨娃娃都吃的红光光的。”梁村群众在短期内曾抢种莜麦一二○亩，消灭荒地一三八亩。全区群众提出“前方消灭阎锡山，后方消灭荒地”口号，动员男女劳动消灭荒地，大量补种晚庄稼。据二区十六个村统计，共补种莜麦二三八○亩，抢种小谷一○四○亩，消灭荒地一千八百余亩。该区群众原有互助劳动习惯，对于恢复生产重建家园都具有信心，他们说：“咱这片地面顶富足，有民主政府领导，用不了二年就翻过来了。”许多村庄妇女儿童都一齐出发拔蒿除草，准备扩大种麦。郜北村水地现已耕过二遍，神堂头、王联庄麦地已翻百分之八十以上，五合庄孙家河二十村翻地已在一半以上。民主政府颁布奖励开荒办法以后，全区群众正动员所有全半劳动力突击种麦，准备消灭一万亩荒地。过去在边沿地区土改时畏惧斗争的逃亡地主返家后，民主政府亦同样保障其生命安全，并分给他们土地，使他们安心生产。"

A dispatch from Telepress Bucharest: The magazine \"For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy,\" published on September 15th, points out that working among intellectuals is one of the main tasks of the Communist Party. The publication states: The experience of intellectuals actively and bravely fighting against fascist aggression alongside the working class in recent years has led ideologically progressive figures in the scientific and cultural fields into the democratic and anti-imperialist camp. Today, progressive intellectuals constitute a considerable force among millions of peace, progress, and democracy fighters. This was clearly demonstrated at the Wroclaw Congress for the Defense of Peace and Culture. The decisions of the Wroclaw Congress place significant and glorious tasks before the Communist Parties of all countries, especially those in the countries led by the Communist Party, namely, to organize and lead the intellectuals in their respective countries in the defense of peace and culture. The publication demands that the Communist Party should pay more attention to the work of intellectuals and train them in the spirit of the most progressive Marxist-Leninist scientific thought. Naturally, those intellectuals who participate in or lean towards the Communist Party inevitably carry a certain burden of bourgeois ideology and prejudices. They must be helped in various ways to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology and prejudices, and be firmly led to advance towards scientific socialism. Working among intellectuals requires thoughtful consideration and careful deliberation in solving and handling problems; but this does not mean that the Communist Party should tolerate those who verbally acknowledge the communist worldview but are actually tools of bourgeois ideology, or tolerate those who still maintain a so-called independent and non-partisan stance in their actual work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 情报局机关刊物号召：  各国党要领导知识分子　向科学的社会主义迈进\n\n1948-09-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　情报局机关刊物号召：\n    各国党要领导知识分子\n  　向科学的社会主义迈进\n    【新华社陕北十九日电】电通社布加勒斯特讯：九月十五日出版的“争取持久和平与人民民主”杂志指出，在知识分子当中进行工作，是共产党的主要任务之一。该刊称：近几年来，知识分子与工人阶级一道积极与勇敢地进行反法西斯侵略的斗争之经验，将科学与文化界思想前进的人士引导到民主与反帝国主义阵营中。今天，进步的知识分子，在千百万和平、进步与民主战士当中构成一支相当大的力量。这在保卫和平与文化的罗克劳大会上得到了明显的证明。罗克劳大会的决定，使各国共产党特别是共产党领导的国家，面临着重大而光荣的任务，这就是在保卫和平与文化当中组织及领导其国内的知识分子。该刊要求共产党应该更多的注意对知识分子的工作，本着最进步的马列主义科学思想之精神去训练他们。自然，参加或倾向共产党的那些知识分子，当然带有资产阶级思想意识与偏见的某种负担，必须以各种办法帮助他们涤除资产阶级思想意识与偏见的残余，并坚定地领导他们向科学的社会主义迈进。在知识分子当中工作，对问题的解决和处理需要深思熟虑与谨慎周密；但这并不是说共产党应该宽容那些口头上承认共产主义世界观而实际上仍为资产阶级思想意识之工具的人们，或宽容那些在其实际工作中依然保留所谓独立及无党派立场的人们。"

    "content": "Korea Establishes New Type of Democratic State\n　　Polish Workers' Party Clears Rightist Deviation\n　　The Korean Supreme People's Assembly, \"the only legitimate Korean supreme legislative power organ in the whole country\" elected by 85.2 percent of voters from all over Korea, successfully completed its historically significant first session from September 2nd to 10th. It passed the constitution of the People's Democratic Republic; it elected the Presidium of the Assembly; it formed \"a general national government established by the will of the people of North and South Korea\"; it proposed to promote the Land Reform Law, the Industrial Nationalization Law, the Labor Law, the Women's Equality Law, and other democratic reforms that have been implemented in North Korea to the whole country, and to oppose the American monopoly capital's colonization of Korea, to oppose the revival of Japanese imperialism, and to strengthen the Korean People's Army and other correct political programs; it issued a note requesting the immediate simultaneous withdrawal of troops by the United States and the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its willingness to withdraw troops simultaneously with the United States since September last year, this note is in fact a powerful condemnation of American imperialism, which continues to unreasonably occupy South Korea and support a puppet regime in South Korea. The establishment of the national Korean Supreme People's Assembly and the national democratic government demonstrates \"the political unity of the vast majority of people in North and South Korea,\" indicating that the Korean people, relying on their own unity and strength, have entered a new period of struggle for the liberation and independence of all of Korea. A new type of country, admired by all oppressed nations, has been erected on the Asian continent. The success of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly, the unity and strength of the Korean people, have greatly shocked the South Korean reactionaries and their American masters: Syngman Rhee, the puppet president of South Korea, admitted that thousands of people in South Korea have been arrested for participating in the election of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly; a special martial law has now been declared in Seoul; and the U.S. occupation forces have expressed in various ways that they will remain stationed in South Korea indefinitely.\n　　The Central Committee of the Polish Workers' Party, at its plenary session held from August 31st to September 3rd, successfully cleared the rightist ideology and nationalist errors deviation within the party, headed by the former General Secretary Gomulka. The plenary session passed a resolution, pointing out that the root of this deviation was the idea of ​​overestimating the reactionary forces and underestimating the weak and incompetent thinking of the revolutionary forces. Therefore, it lacked confidence and loyalty to the working class, relaxed the class struggle, and had an unclear understanding of the role of the Soviet Communist Party in the international anti-imperialist camp. The resolution called on the whole party to launch criticism and self-criticism, and strengthen learning to correct the above-mentioned erroneous deviation. This resolution of the plenary session was sincerely supported by the whole party, and Gomulka also openly admitted his mistakes. The current General Secretary of the Workers' Party and President of Poland, Beirut, pointed out: \"The Workers' Party has extricated itself from the crisis and has become stronger and more robust than in the past.\"\n　　The League for the Defense of Democracy, initiated by the Japanese Communist Party as a prototype of a people's front organization, has been formed in Japan. In a letter to Wallace, it stated that its goals are to defend political freedom, world peace, national independence, and oppose the revival of fascist forces. It joined the fight against the anti-strike law as soon as it was born. The strike struggles of Japanese railway workers and communications workers are still continuing. \"Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Japanese working class is putting up a tenacious resistance to the attempt of imperialism to establish a colonial regime in Japan. The Japanese democratic forces have now become a powerful unit in the world democratic camp.\" (Labor News) The Soviet Union has repeatedly insisted at and after the meetings of the Allied Council for Japan that the reactionary authorities of the United States and Japan must abolish anti-labor directives, orders, and suppressive actions.\n　　The movement of the Indonesian people to resist the Dutch aggressors has been developing again. The Indonesian Communist Party issued an appeal, calling on the people to prepare to meet the new aggression of the Netherlands, and must fight for their freedom by all means. The brutal suppression and \"sweeping\" of the Dutch army in the occupied areas of Java has further aroused the armed resistance of the local people. The new provocations of the Dutch army against the Republic of Indonesia have aroused local resistance from the Indonesian army in some areas of East and West Java. Indonesian youths in Yogyakarta held demonstrations against the Hatta government's continued negotiations that would lead to the betrayal of national sovereignty and humiliation.\n　　Other important international events in recent times are as follows:\n　　(1) The meeting of representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the disposal of former Italian colonies was held in Paris from the 13th to the 15th at the suggestion of the Soviet Union. Because the United States, Britain, and France had the intention of circumventing the Soviet Union and dividing the former Italian colonies among themselves, the meeting did not achieve any results.\n　　(2) The Greek Democratic Army won another great victory. In the Vitsi-Florina area in the far north of Greece, in continuous operations from August 24th to September 13th, nearly 8,000 enemies were killed, wounded, or captured, and an unprecedented amount of enemy equipment and military supplies were seized.\n　　(3) Italian guerrilla fighters commemorated the \"Resistance Day\" of the Italian people on September 8th. Italian Communist leader Togliatti issued a message on the anniversary, calling on the people to unite and declaring that \"the ideals and programs of the resistance movement still live in the hearts of the best sons and daughters of Italy.\"\n　　(4) On September 12th, all cities in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany held conferences to commemorate the victims of the Nazi rule era. In Berlin, 400,000 working people held a large anti-fascist demonstration.

    "content": "Masses' Voice\n\n　　Xili Village, Shijiazhuang City\n\nWhy No Compensation for Wrongfully Accused Outsider?\n\nComrade Editor:\n\nI have lived in Xili Village, Seventh District, Shijiazhuang City, for eight years. I am now sixty-four years old. I worked in the anti-Japanese resistance since 1939. Later, due to illness, I came to the village (with a letter of introduction from my village district to Xili Village as proof) to treat sores and make a small living as a porter. On September 26th of last year, when the People's Liberation Army arrived in the village, Bai Ernian (who served as a railway guard for the Japanese-controlled South Manchuria Railway in the old years) hid in the courtyard where I lived. The district cadre came to the village, and Bai Ernian and his elder brother Bai Danian (who worked as a staff member for the Japanese-controlled South Manchuria Railway in the old years) became village cadres (Danian as director of the Armed Forces Committee, Ernian as a public security officer). They conspired with the wife of Wang Dezi, who lived in the same courtyard as me (who owed me wages and 67 jin of millet that I should have received for my work as a porter, which he didn't want to give me), to falsely accuse me of being a person to be struggled against. First, they confiscated 103 jin of salt that I used for business (including the bags). District cadre Lao An (who lived in the village and led the work) instructed Bai Ernian to threaten me not to give me a confiscation receipt and put the hat of a fleeing landlord/struggled-against household on me, and threatened me as a Guomindang spy. On the thirteenth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, on a day of heavy snow, the village cadres forcibly drove me out of the village and completely confiscated the materials I had worked hard to acquire. After my family of three returned to my home village, my village cadres, after hearing my description of the village's illegal methods, immediately gave me a letter of introduction, proving that I was not a rich peasant, let alone a landlord, and that I was indeed working in the anti-Japanese resistance and recovering from illness in Shijiazhuang. The Sixth District of Longyao County also sent a letter to the village to negotiate for the return of my materials. On December 27th, I took a letter of introduction from the village district to the village and asked District Cadre Lao An to return my materials. After reading the letter, Lao An told me to negotiate with the village cadres, and the village cadres told me to ask Lao An, passing the buck back and forth. Village cadre Liu Jitang insisted that I was a person who should be struggled against and would not return my materials, saying that the letter of introduction was fake. I told them to communicate with my home village district for investigation, and if it was fake, I would gladly accept the punishment. Bai Shuangxi shouted loudly, \"If you don't leave, and say any more, we'll detain you for a few days and execute you!\" I had no choice but to return to my home village and report the true situation in the village to the Sixth District of Longyao. The Sixth District and my home village again wrote letters to the municipal government. On the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, I took the district and village letters to the municipal government. On the eighth day of the second lunar month, the municipal government told me that they had sent people to the village twice, and the village cadres had agreed to return the materials in full, and instructed me to go to the village to collect them. On the tenth day, I went to the village again, and Lao An instructed the village cadres to tell me that the salt had been divided up and eaten, the foreign cloth had been divided up and used, the coat was worn by someone, the student clothes were given to someone, and all the valuable things were gone, refusing to give them to me, prevaricating and stalling. He also said: The city doesn't care about the district, the district doesn't care about the village, if the village doesn't give it to you, no one can do anything. I went to the municipal government again, and they told me to wait a few days. After waiting a few days, I ran out of money and had to return to my home village again. When I left, I asked the municipal government to negotiate with the village, and if there were any results, to instruct me to go to Shijiazhuang again, but I have not received any news so far. I am now in such poverty that I have no way to do anything, and I cannot go to Shijiazhuang. My list of materials and supporting documents are all in Shijiazhuang. How should the materials detained by Xili Village now be handled? Can they be returned to me? I know that the newspaper office is the place to solve the people's suffering.

Soviet cotton leads the world in both quality and yield. Soviet scientists have not only cultivated varieties with long fibers but also varieties with fluffy fibers, and most notably, varieties with natural colors, with about twenty shades.\n    ★ Researchers at the Plant Physiology Institute named after the great biologist Timiryazev have developed several chemicals to increase plant yields. Spraying a powdered medicine on tomato blossoms can increase the harvest by four to five times. Spraying a powdered medicine on fruit tree blossoms can prevent premature fruit drop and make the fruit grow exceptionally large. These powdered medicines have been used extensively on thousands of hectares of collective farms this year.\n    ★ Winter wheat and naked barley are being sown for the first time this year in the frigid Siberian steppe region, which was previously considered unsuitable for growing these winter crops. However, scientist Lysenko carefully studied the conditions there and concluded that the inability to cultivate them was due to the accumulation of large amounts of ice shards in the soil after autumn plowing, which damaged the plant's system, along with dry winds. Therefore, he suggested sowing seeds on unplowed land after the autumn harvest to prevent the crops from being harmed by underground ice shards and leaving the stubble of the autumn harvest crops to protect against the wind.\n    ★ Thanks to the painstaking cultivation of Soviet breeders, valuable fruit trees that were originally only suitable for planting in the south have been successfully planted in Leningrad. Fifteen varieties of cherry trees have been planted there, and the size and color of the cherries are no less than those in the south, with some varieties tasting even better than those in the south.\n    ★ The All-Union Tea Industry and Subtropical Plant Science Research Institute in Georgia-Anasuri has created valuable new varieties of tea, lemons, and geraniums. The new lemons weigh nearly four taels each, are juicy and fragrant, and contain 2% more citric acid than other varieties. The new geraniums produce twice as much oil as other varieties.

The issue of the former Italian colonies has been decided to be submitted to the third United Nations General Assembly, which will open on September 21st, for resolution. Under the general principle of maintaining military bases on the Mediterranean coast, U.S. imperialism proposed a so-called proposal to the representative meeting, advocating that Cyrenaica (a part of Libya) be handed over to British \"trusteeship\" and Somaliland be \"returned\" to Italy. Agence France-Presse revealed that the U.S. proposal was formulated by the U.S.-British Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the aim of maintaining the so-called anti-Soviet \"Mediterranean balance.\" At the meeting on the 14th, Soviet representative Vyshinsky revealed that the United States and Britain, disregarding the interests of peace, had already expanded wartime American bases in Libya. Based on the principles of considering the wishes and welfare of the residents of the colonies and the security of peace (the Four-Power Joint Declaration in the Italian Peace Treaty), Vyshinsky proposed the Soviet proposal, advocating that Italian colonies be left to Italian representatives to be managed by the United Nations under the condition that democratic governments composed of representatives of local residents could be established in the colonies. This proposal was rejected by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France. In order to reach a compromise agreement, Vyshinsky put forward another new proposal, advocating that Libya be allowed to become independent after ten years. The management issues during these ten years would be handled in accordance with the United Nations trusteeship agreement, and the establishment of a democratic government organized by local residents would be guaranteed. The remaining two Italian colonies would also be handled in essentially the same way. Vyshinsky pointed out that the Soviet proposal actually followed the American plan put forward by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes on September 13, 1945, but it was still unreasonably rejected by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, and the meeting failed to make any decision. Note: There are three former Italian colonies, all in Africa, and their strategic positions are very important. The first is Libya, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, with an area of ​​more than 600,000 square miles and a population of 880,000. Its eastern part is called Cyrenaica, and its western part is called Tripolitania; the second is Italian Eritrea, on the west coast of the Red Sea, with an area of ​​15,000 square miles and a population of 600,000; the third is Italian Somaliland, on the west coast of the Indian Ocean, with an area of ​​190,000 square miles and a population of 1.3 million.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 美帝图据有地中海岸军事基地　四强代表会未获协议\n\n1948-09-23\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　美帝图据有地中海岸军事基地\n  　四强代表会未获协议\n    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方报导：苏、美、英、法四国巴黎代表会议已于十五日闭幕，未获任何协议，前意大利殖民地问题已决定提交九月二十一日开幕的第三届联合国大会解决。美帝国主义在保持地中海沿岸军事基地的总方针下，这次曾向代表会议提出所谓建议案，主张将昔兰尼加（利比亚的一部分）交给英国“托管”，将索马利兰“交还”意大利。法新社透露，美国建议案是由美英联合参谋部制订的，目的是在保持所谓反苏的“地中海均势”。在十四日的会议上，苏代表维辛斯基揭露美英两国不顾和平的利益，早已在利比亚扩大战时的美国基地。根据应考虑各殖民地居民愿望与福利及和平安全的原则（对意和约中四强联合宣言），维辛斯基提出苏联的建议，主张能在各殖民地建立由当地居民代表组成民主政府的条件下，将意大利各殖民地留交意大利代表联合国托管。此一建议遭到美英法代表的拒绝。为了能够达到一项折衷协定，维辛斯基又提出另一新建议，主张允许利比亚在十年以后独立，在此十年期间的管理问题，则按照联合国托管协议处理，并保证建立由本地居民组织的民主政府。意大利其余二殖民地，也大体上按这一办法处理。维辛斯基提出，苏联这一建议案实际上是沿用前美国国务卿贝纳斯在一九四五年九月十三日所提出来的美国方案，但仍然遭到美英法代表的无理拒绝，并使会议未作出任何决定。按：前意大利殖民地共有三处，都在非洲，战略地位都很重要。其一为利比亚，在地中海南岸，面积六十余万方哩，人口八十八万，其东部称为昔兰尼加，西部称为的黎波里坦尼亚；其二为意属厄立特里亚，在红海西岸，面积一万五千方哩，人口六十万；其三为意属索马利兰，在印度洋西岸，面积十九万方哩，人口一百三十万。"

    "content": "From the column: Correspondence between Editors and Readers\n\n　　False Report on Summer Grain Tax in Nanlong Palace, Gaocheng\n　　Due to Careless Revision by Our Internal Staff\n\nComrades of the Editorial Department:\n　　Upon seeing the news published in your newspaper on July 24th regarding the exemption of poor peasant league members from the summer grain tax burden in Nanlong Palace Village, Gaocheng County, we immediately notified the district to conduct an investigation. The next day, the district wrote a report stating, \"There is no such matter in the summer grain tax collection.\" Still fearing inaccuracy, Director Zhao (Director of the Finance Section) personally went to the village yesterday for detailed inquiries. Today, we have confirmed the truth: the report in the newspaper likely confused the timing, or the source of the material was hearsay. The talk of exempting poor peasant league members from the grain tax burden during the wheat tax collection is completely inconsistent with the facts. Only this spring, when collecting the outstanding autumn grain tax, the village work team mistakenly announced at a meeting that poor peasant league members would be exempt from the burden. We promptly corrected this and reported it to the Commissioner's Office several times in meetings. Because the work team also made deviations in party rectification, no one among the new and old cadres is working, and the wheat tax distribution has not been properly allocated to households to this day. How did Wang Xiaogui get seven pieces of cloth? It must be that the writer carelessly brought up a past situation again, causing a major mistake. Please investigate thoroughly and correct it accordingly!\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　County Magistrate of Gaocheng, Liu Xue\n\n◇ Earlier this month, we received a letter from County Magistrate Liu Xue of Gaocheng, correcting the false report about the exemption of poor peasant league members from the summer grain tax burden in Nanlong Palace Village. In the middle of the month, we also received a report from Director Luo of the Border Government Administrative Office, along with a report from County Magistrate Liu Xue of Gaocheng to Commissioner Yang on this issue (identical to the above letter), after the Border Region Government Finance Department promptly telegraphed the Jizhong Administrative Office to send personnel to investigate and correct the matter based on the newspaper report. All stated that there was no exemption for poor peasant leagues in the village's summer grain tax collection this year. Originally, there was a period when poor peasant leagues were not exempt from the burden during the collection of the remaining autumn grain tax from last spring, which was immediately corrected. The news incorrectly wrote the mistake made during the autumn grain tax collection as a fact in the summer grain tax collection, which is incorrect. This material was written by our newspaper reporters Yao Fu and Huai Yu. The original spirit of the manuscript was based on the fact that the summer grain tax collection in the village was lagging behind, describing the past disunity of the branch and the work team's erroneous announcement during the autumn grain tax collection that poor peasant league members would be exempt from the burden, which had aroused dissatisfaction from all strata. At the beginning of the summer grain tax collection, no one in the village was responsible, and the poor peasant league chairman was acting alone, unable to even hold meetings, so the summer grain tax allocation could not be carried out. This situation is real, and the original manuscript written by Yao Fu and Huai Yu was not wrong. The cause of the error was that an assistant editor, when revising the manuscript, did not understand the original spirit, felt that the manuscript was not clear enough and did not grasp the key points, and did not write to inquire about it. They then mistakenly changed \"autumn grain tax\" to \"summer grain tax,\" and our editorial department's various links were negligent in proofreading the original manuscript, resulting in an error that was inconsistent with the facts. In addition to conducting a profound self-criticism, we extend our apologies to the village cadres of the Gaocheng district. The Border Region Government, the Administrative Office, and the Commissioner's Office can seriously and quickly inspect the actual work problems reflected in the newspaper, and immediately inform us when they find facts that do not match, which is very beneficial to improving our work and improving the newspaper.

    "content": "Column: Voices of the Masses\n\n　　Why Do I Still Have to Pay Taxes on Land I Returned?\n　　The Second District of Yuanchao Needs to Conduct an Inspection\n\n　　During the land reform, the outer village of Ding had a lot of land that no one was farming. It was divided among me and Wu Zhongyan and six others. This land was more than four li away from the village. Because the land was far away and difficult to cultivate, it required a lot of labor, but the harvest was small (a total of one large dou of grain for the whole year). Therefore, everyone voluntarily withdrew from farming it. But they all said that I had little land. This land, nine mu, nine fen, and seven cai, was not even equivalent to two mu of standard land. Whether it yielded grain or not, even gathering firewood, so I continued to farm it. When it came time to pay the public grain, the village chief, Chen Yanhai, and the village farmers' association director, Song Maochun, said: You can't calculate that land at two fen per mu, you have to pay public grain according to the standard land. I asked that when they farmed it before, it was calculated at two fen per mu, why is it being raised to the standard now that I am farming it? He said it was raised to the standard for you. I had no choice but to pay the public grain entirely according to the standard land.\n\n　　But the price of that land is still two fen. This means I have to use the grain from other land to pay the public grain for this piece of land. I can't afford to farm this land anymore. Therefore, in February of the lunar calendar this year, I asked the branch secretary and other village cadres to stop renting this land. The village chief and the director of the farmers' association irresponsibly said, now that democracy is being implemented, we have no right to solve this for you, you should find the masses. In February of the lunar calendar, the village cadres convened a mass meeting of the entire village. I took this opportunity to explain to the masses, so I did not farm this land this year, and to this day no one has farmed this land.\n\n　　During the wheat harvest season this year, the director, village chief, and other cadres forced me to pay the public grain for this piece of land. I felt wronged and went to find the village cadre, Wang Wenqing. He said if you truly explained it to the masses, then we wouldn't ask you to pay. But if you said you weren't farming that piece of land during the collection, then you have to pay the public grain. I'll ask the village cadres later if you explained it. In the evening, the village cadre and the village cadre called me to the exchange. Wang Wenqing and the village branch secretary said I was undermining the Land Law Outline and used three militiamen to detain me and send me to the district office.\n\n　　I was kept in the detention room for eleven days before they questioned me once. I explained the above situation about farming the land. Assistant Liu said you have to pay the public grain for this piece of land. If you don't pay, we'll send you to the county. I was also made to stand as punishment before the messenger sent me back home. The next morning, they sent me to the county judicial section. I explained the above situation to the judicial section. The judicial section didn't accept it and told me to go back to the district. I was detained for another two days. Assistant Liu asked me again, still forcing me to pay the public grain for this piece of land. I said I couldn't afford it, I would sell my land. Only then did he let me go home, giving me five days to pay. I asked him to give me a written explanation of the reason, but he didn't give it to me.\n\n　　Should Assistant Liu in the district have made me stand as punishment? Should he have detained me for eleven days before questioning me once? Should the village cadres have raised the land to the standard land? I declared to the masses that I would not farm this land anymore, should I still be forced to pay the public grain for this piece of land? Please answer.\n　　Wang Junfeng, Zhang Tiejicun, First District of Yuanchao\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 退了地为啥还得出负担？　元朝二区应作检查\n王俊峰\n1948-09-23\n第1版()\n专栏：群众呼声\n\n　　退了地为啥还得出负担？\n  　元朝二区应作检查\n    在土改时，外村的町的土地较多没人种，分给我和吴仲言等七个人种；这地离村四里多远，因为地远难耕，下劳力较大，收获却少（全年共打粮一大斗），因此大家都自愿退出不种。但他们都说我地少，这地九亩九分七才折合不足二亩标准地，打粮食不打粮食，落把柴火，所以我就接着种了。到交纳公粮的时候，村长陈彦海，村农会主任宋茂春他们说：你种那地每亩不能算折二分了，得按标准地纳公粮。我问原先他们种时，每亩折合二分，我种怎么就提成标准了？他说就这给你提到标准地了。我没法只好完全按标准地交纳公粮。\n    但那地的价格仍是二折。这样还得将其它地打的粮食，纳这块地的公粮，这地我也种不起了。所以在今年旧历二月间，向支部书记及其他村干部要求，不租这块地，村长农会主任不负责的说，现在实行民主哩，我们没有权给你解决，你找群众吧。旧历二月村干召集全村群众大会，借此机会向群众说明，所以今年就没种这块地，直至现在这块地还没人种。\n    在今年麦季征收公粮的时候，主任村长等干部，却逼迫我交纳这块地的公粮。我感觉冤枉，又找坐村干部王文卿，他说如果真正向群众说明过，就不叫你拿了；如果这会征收时，你随时说不种那块地了，你得纳公粮，一会我问问村干部看你说明否？到晚上村干与坐村干部把我叫到交易所，王文卿、村支部书记说我破坏土地法大纲，用三个民兵将我拘押送到区公所里。\n    一直住了十一天禁闭室，才问了我一次。我将上述种地情况述说一遍，刘助理说你得拿这块地的公粮，你不拿送你县。又罚了一回站，才叫通信员送回我去。到第二天早晨将我送到县司法科。我将上述情况对司法科述说了一遍，司法科不收，又叫我回到区里，又扣押了两天，刘助理又问了一次，仍逼着叫我拿这块地的公粮。我说我拿不起，我回家卖地吧。他才让我回家，限五日缴纳。我请他批给我一个手续说明理由，他不给我。\n    区里刘助理该不该叫我罚站，该不该扣押我十一天才问我一次？村里干部该不该将地提成标准地？我向群众声明不种这块地了，该不该继叫我纳这块地的公粮？请答复一下。\n    元朝一区张铁集村王俊峰"

In North Korea, mass rallies and demonstrations are being held everywhere to celebrate the establishment of a unified democratic government. According to preliminary statistics, as of the 15th, the number of people participating in mass rallies and demonstrations in Pyongyang exceeded 300,000, 120,000 in Hamhung, 118,000 in Sinuiju, 91,000 in Wonsan, 89,000 in Chongjin, 90,000 in Nanam, and 57,000 in Haeju. At the mass rally in Pyongyang, representatives from various political parties in North and South Korea, as well as representatives from workers, farmers, and intellectuals, delivered speeches, unanimously expressing their welcome and support for the unified democratic government. Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman of the Presidium of the Assembly Kim Tu-bong delivered speeches in reply. The meeting passed a resolution stating: \"The central government, headed by the national hero Kim Il-sung, is a government of the true people. The program announced by the government is the struggle program of the entire people.\" In South Korea, the US military occupation authorities and the Seoul puppet government, frightened by the success of the Supreme People's Assembly elections, have been carrying out large-scale arrests of people from all walks of life who participated in the Korean Supreme People's Assembly elections since mid-August. According to South Korean puppet President Syngman Rhee, as of September 2nd, thousands of people had been arrested. According to other news agency reports, the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has appeared several times in front of the heavily guarded puppet government building in Seoul and in other parts of the city.

    "content": "Labor Flag-bearer Zhen Rongdian\n—One of the Workers' Representatives from Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Attending the National Labor Congress\n\n\tComrade Zhen Rongdian earned the glorious title of \"Shell King\" during the most difficult period of the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in the Taihang Mountains. Six years later, he is attending the Sixth National Labor Congress with the honor of being a labor flag-bearer from Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu.\n\n\tIn 1940, during the Hundred Regiments Offensive that shook the Japanese invaders, the Eighth Route Army's self-made grenade launchers appeared, shocking the Japanese. Okamura Neji exclaimed that the Eighth Route Army had \"large-scale, modern military industry.\" In fact, those were the products of the Huangyandong Arsenal, where \"Shell King\" Zhen Rongdian began his apprenticeship. There, mountain stream water was the basic power, railway tracks from the enemy-occupied areas were the only source of steel, and the belts were woven from hemp rope. Ten hours of labor a day, constantly repeating simple movements, requiring every second for both hands to exert all their strength—turning the outer circle of artillery shells was a simple, heavy physical labor that offered no technical skills. Others said, \"Your body can't take it, there's no progress.\" But Zhen Rongdian said, \"As long as it benefits the front lines, I'll keep doing it.\" A high sense of responsibility made him persevere for five years. In just two years, he went from an ordinary apprentice to a special-class labor hero who caused a sensation throughout the entire border region.\n\n\tIn 1942, the anti-mopping-up war in Taihang reached its cruelest point, and the higher authorities called for a new worker movement to support the front lines. Zhen Rongdian suggested, \"If the superiors set the plan, the workers always feel that it's the superiors' business, and they can't be blamed if they don't complete it; if they set their own plan, they always feel it's their own responsibility if they don't complete it, and they have to find a way.\" The plan he set played a leading role in the movement. The output increased from dozens of shells per person per day to one hundred, two hundred... Eventually, general skilled workers reached more than three hundred, and Zhen Rongdian created a record of four hundred and eighty, with each shell averaging only seventy-five seconds, earning the glorious title of \"Shell King.\" As a result, the entire factory's production more than doubled.\n\n\tDuring the war, Comrade Zhen Rongdian always took the lead. For five full years, he never left his \"Six-Five\" rifle. New Year's, spring plowing, wheat harvest, autumn harvest, every destructive mopping-up operation targeted the military industry department as its main goal. The enemy often used overwhelming force, using \"netting\" and \"combing\" tactics to enter the deep, uninhabited mountains. In the winter of 1940, more than a thousand manual workers, along with their families, the old, and the weak, encountered the enemy when they moved to Hualong Mountain. Zhen Rongdian stepped forward and led twenty-three worker self-defense team members, with twenty-three rifles, to fight the enemy searching the mountains. After three difficult days, he finally protected all the workers with the blood of more than ten self-defense team members and rushed out of the chaotic mountain ridges between the two enemy forces.\n\n\tAfter the anti-mopping-up operation ended and he returned to Huangyandong, the painstakingly managed factory was in ruins. A few workers became pessimistic: \"What's the point of doing anything!\" Zhen Rongdian was a Communist Party member. He said, \"That's how the revolution is. There's no place in the liberated area that the enemy can't reach, but there's also no place for the enemy to stand. The enemy has been driven out no matter how fierce they are, so what if the factory building is burned down? We'll rebuild it and keep working!\" The forty-day resumption plan was completed in twenty days. After that, every time there was an anti-mopping-up operation, they simply regarded repairing the factory as a necessary part of producing shells.\n\n\tZhen Rongdian often said, \"Machines are our two hands. Without hands, we become useless.\" In order not to lose the machines, he often walked three to five miles outside the factory after extremely tiring work to choose a good place to bury the machines, and carefully memorized the nearby landmarks, measuring the direction and distance, as precisely as he turned shells. Burying the most valuable machines in the factory was especially difficult. Every time he went out, it was either uphill or downhill, and thousands of pounds of iron had to be carried by people for several miles. In order to keep the secret, the machines carried by eight people were carried by four people, and he would carry several trips in one night. After finishing, he had to bury his own tools. This super-physical labor caused Zhen Rongdian to suffer internal injuries, and he suffered from bronchitis every winter.\n\n\tDuring the May mopping-up operation in 1942, the enemy deployed so many troops that they could encircle the entire Taihang area hand in hand. The enemy's mopping-up teams searched the mountain slopes from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain every day, and then searched from the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain like a net. The excavation teams searching for machines dug \"three feet into the ground,\" and dug the nearby ground into a mess. In order to protect the workers, the factory director ordered all the workers to move to a distance, but Zhen Rongdian was reluctant to leave. He and several self-defense team members stayed in the mopping-up circle, often only a mile and a half away from the enemy. Whenever the excavation team approached the location where the machine was buried, they would shoot at the enemy, attract the mopping-up team to the mountains, and play \"hide-and-seek\" with the Japanese invaders with their lives.\n\n\tIn 1945, the new \"Eighty-Two\" shell factory was established. No one was idle, even if no goods were shipped. The superiors thought of Zhen Rongdian and transferred him to make \"Eighty-Two\" artillery shells. Under the attention of the entire factory, when he was still a beginner, he made forty-five on his first day of work. But what he was most concerned about was how to improve everyone's output. Every day after work, he would chat with the workers, ask about their difficulties, and break through their minds about the old social habit that apprentices dared not exceed their masters in output. He said, \"This is wrong. This is a work that requires strength. We can't compare with the master in skills, but the young people should run ahead in strength. When have you ever heard of a top student, but never heard of a top teacher.\" On the one hand, he also asked the old masters for technical advice. He was a craftsman who taught apprentices in terms of skills, but he often did chores such as carrying water and sweeping the floor. Even people who initially had prejudices against him were united around him. Half a month later, Zhen Rongdian increased from forty-five to eighty every day, and other workers also increased to fifty. Everyone elected him as the chairman of the labor union.\n\n\tIn October, good news of the great counter-offensive was frequently reported. The front lines needed shells more and more urgently. Zhen Rongdian used all his spare time to find ways to transform tools, and even created an astonishing speed of one hundred and thirty-five per day (ten hours). But this number was still far from enough, so he extended his working hours. He didn't relax for three consecutive months, and even continued to work after two of his toes were crushed. The selfless labor, like a fully powered locomotive, drove up the output of the entire factory and caught up with the needs of the front lines. On the Handan front line, the first beautiful battle to wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's invading army on the front line was launched at this time.\n\n\tVictory followed victory. Batch after batch of machines were transported back to the rear. Zhen Rongdian was transferred to the newly established machine factory in the spring of 1947. The machines that had never been seen before were piled up in a mess, and many of them were \"broken arms and legs.\" Zhen Rongdian said, \"It's no good if we have machines but don't know how to use them!\" He tried to install them one by one. If he didn't understand, he would ask experienced workers for advice. He drew pictures of the missing parts and asked people to repair and match them. He often worked more than fourteen hours a day, and finally assembled all of them. He also launched a vigorous processing assault with the great craftsmen of the machine workshop, making the machines run non-stop for twenty-four hours. The \"Shell King,\" who had been doing simple labor for six years, now ran to the front in the complex and technical work, setting off a heroic labor throughout the factory and manufacturing a batch of machines for manufacturing military supplies. At the same time, the factory's \"Shell Donation Movement\" was also successfully completed. They used voluntary work and donations of money and goods to arm a company of Liu Bocheng's meritorious troops. After the all-out offensive of the People's Liberation Army began, they continuously used voluntary work to create brand-new cannons, inspiring Liu Deng's army to move south to the Central Plains.\n\n\t★　　　　　　★　　　　　　★\n\n\tSince being elected as a special-class labor hero in 1942, Zhen Rongdian has always stood at the forefront of the three Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Hero Conferences and has become a recognized labor flag-bearer. But on the road of the hero's career, he suffered enough for no reason. Disgruntled workers said, \"It's enough to have a hero, what's the point of us doing anything?\" Backward workers watched coldly and said, \"Let the hero 'move,' we can't be heroes, and we won't 'move'.\" But he didn't care, he was still patient in approaching others, examining himself, and said, \"If it weren't for everyone's efforts, I wouldn't be able to become a hero. Everyone is a real hero, I'm just a representative cultivated by everyone.\" He deeply understood the famous saying \"Hero's career, mass style.\" No matter where he worked, he always humbly and seriously learned from the masses and constantly improved himself. Even when he attended the National Labor Congress in Harbin, he still paid attention to learning new technologies whenever he had time. He said, \"The revolution is getting bigger and bigger, and there are many machines that I haven't seen before. I'm not afraid of not having used them, I'm afraid of not learning. As long as we twist into a force with the masses, everything can be done well!\"\n\n\tSelfless and always moving forward, this is the true color of a hero, and Zhen Rongdian, this thirty-one-year-old labor flag-bearer, speaks so humbly, simply, and full of confidence.\n\n\tZhen Rongdian is from Tang County, Hebei Province, the son of a poor peasant. He worked hard on the Yuehan Road at the age of seventeen and has experienced the hardships of society. He has a high degree of class consciousness.\n(Excerpt from Northeast Daily)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 劳动旗手甄荣典—参加全国劳大的晋冀鲁豫工人代表之一\n\n1948-09-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　劳动旗手甄荣典\n    —参加全国劳大的晋冀鲁豫工人代表之一\n    甄荣典同志荣获“炮弹大王”这光荣称号，还是在太行山敌后抗日战争最艰苦的时候。六年后的今天，他又带着晋冀鲁豫工人旗手的荣誉，出席全国第六次劳动大会。\n    一九四○年，震动日寇的百团大战中，出现了八路军自造的掷弹筒，骇倒了日寇，冈村宁次惊呼八路军有了“规模宏大的现代化军事工业”。其实，那就是“炮弹王”甄荣典开始其学徒生活的黄烟洞兵工厂的产品。在那里，山涧流水是基本动力，敌占区的铁路轨是钢的唯一来源，轮带是自己用麻绳织成的。一天十小时的劳动，不间断的重复着简单的动作以每秒钟双手都得使上浑身力气——旋车炮弹外圆是一种最苦重而又学不到什么技术的单纯体力劳动。旁人说：“身体吃不消，没进步。”甄荣典却说：“只要对前线有利，我就干下去。”高度责任心使他坚持了五年。他在短短的两年中，从一个普通的学徒变成轰动全边区的特等劳动英雄。\n    一九四二年，太行反扫荡战争到了残酷的顶点，上级号召展开支援前线的新劳动者运动。甄荣典提意见说：“上级给订计划，工友们总觉那是上级的事，完不成可怪不了咱；要是自己订的计划，完不成总感到是自己的责任，怎的也得想出个办法。”他订的计划，在运动中起了带头作用。从每天每人几十发炮弹提高到一百发、二百发…………最后一般熟练工人高到三百多发，而甄荣典创造了四百八十发的最高纪录，每发平均只需七十五秒钟，荣获“炮弹大王”光荣称号。全厂生产，因而超过一倍以上。\n    在战争中，甄荣典同志也总是走在头里。整整五年从没离开过他的“六五”步枪，年关、春耕、麦收、秋收，每一次的毁灭性的清剿都以军工部为其主要目标，敌人经常以压倒优势兵力，用“拉网”“梳篦”战术打进人迹罕到的大山里。四○年冬，一千多徒手工人连带家属老弱，转移到华龙山时遭遇了敌人，甄荣典挺身而出，带领二十三个工人自卫队员、二十三支步枪，和搜山的敌人搏斗，经过艰难的三天，终于以十多个自卫队员的热血掩护了全体工人，从两股敌人之间的乱山梁上冲了出去。\n    反扫荡结束后回到黄烟洞，苦心经营的工厂成了废墟。少数工人悲观起来：“这还有啥干的！”甄荣典是共产党员，他说：“革命就是这样，解放区没有敌人到不了的地方，可也没一处地方让敌人站住脚。敌人再凶也打出去了，烧掉厂房算啥？盖了再干！”四十天的复工计划在二十天中全部完成。此后每次反扫荡，他们干脆把修复工厂看做生产炮弹的必经过程之一。\n    甄荣典常说：“机器就是我们的两只手，没了手咱就成了废人了。”为了不丢掉的机器，他常在工作极度疲劳之后，走到工厂三五里外，选择埋藏机器的好地方，并且细心牢记附近的目标，量好方向距离，如同车炮弹一样精确。埋藏厂中最贵重的机器尤其困难，一出门不是上坡就是下坡，几千斤铁得用人抬几里地，为了保守秘密，八个人抬的机器四个人就架着走了，一个晚上扛他几趟，完了还要埋藏自己的工具，超体力劳动使甄荣典受了内伤，每年冬天就闹气管炎。\n    四二年的五月大扫荡，敌人出动的兵力，手拉手可以把太行区围上一圈。敌人清剿队每天围着山脚搜到山顶，又从山顶撒网一样搜到山脚，寻找机器的挖掘队，“入土三尺”，把附近地皮掏的稀烂。为了保全工人，厂长命令所有工人一律向远处转移，但甄荣典舍不得走开，和几个自卫队员留在清剿圈里，经常只离敌人一里半里，每当挖掘队走近埋藏机器的位置，他们就向敌人射击，把清剿队吸引上山，用生命和日寇捉起“迷藏”来。\n    四五年，新成立“八二”炮弹厂，谁也没有闲着，就是不出货，上级想到甄荣典，调他来，造“八二”大炮弹，在他还是初试，全厂瞩目下，他上工第一天就做了四十五个。但他最关心的还是如何提高大家产量，每天下工后，就和工人闲谈，问他们的困难，学徒产量不敢超过师父这是旧社会的恶习，他就打通他们思想说：“这话说岔了，这是用力气的活，比技术咱比不过师父，比力气年轻人就该跑到头里。什么时候只听说状元徒弟，那有说状元师傅的。”一面他又到老师父跟前请教技术。论技术是带徒弟的工匠了，但他常做挑水、扫地等杂活，连起初对他有成见的人都团结到他周围了。半个月后甄荣典每天由四十五增到八十个，旁的工人也提高到五十个。大家选他当了工会主任。\n    十月，大反攻捷报频传，前线需要炮弹愈益迫切，甄荣典利用一切空隙时间，又想法改造工具，竟创造了每天（十小时）一百三十五个的惊人速度。但这数字还是差得远，他便将工作时间延长，一连三个月没松劲，甚至脚趾被砸碎两只后，包住伤口还是继续工作。奋不顾身的劳动，就象开足马力的火车头，把全厂的产量带起来，追上了前线的需要。而在邯郸前线，上了前线，全歼蒋介石进犯军的第一次漂亮仗就在这时打响了。\n    胜利接着胜利，一批批机器运回后方，甄荣典在四七年春天调到新成立的机器厂。从未见过的机器乱堆在一起，不少都是“断胳膊缺腿”的。甄荣典说：“有了机器不会用还行！”一件件试着按装，不懂的就请教有经验的工人，欠缺的机件自己画图找人修配，每天经常工作十四小时以上，终于全部装配好了。并且和机工所的大工匠们，发动了轰轰烈烈的加工突击，使机器二十四小时不息转动。六年来一直做着简单劳动的“炮弹王”，现在做起技术复杂的细工，一样跑到头里，掀起了全厂英雄劳动，制造出一批制造军火的机器来。和这同时，全厂的“献炮运动”也胜利完成，他们用义务工和献金献物，给刘伯承有功部队武装一个连。解放军全面进攻开始后，他们又不断的用义务工造出全新的大炮，鼓舞着南下中原的刘邓大军。\n    ★　　　　　　★　　　　　　★\n    从一九四二年当选特等劳动英雄起，甄荣典在晋冀鲁豫三届群英大会中，始终站在前列，已成为公认的劳动旗手了。但在英雄的事业道路上，无端的打击折磨就够他受的，不服气的工人说：“有英雄就行啦，咱还干个啥劲？”落后的工人冷眼看着说：“让英雄‘运动’去吧，咱当不了英雄，咱也不‘运动’。”但他毫不计较，还是耐心的接近别人、检讨自己，并且说：“要是没有大家努力，我也当不了英雄，大家都是真正的英雄，我不过是大家培养出来的代表吧了。”他深深体会了“英雄事业，群众作风”的名言，无论到哪里工作，总是向群众虚心认真学习，不断提高自己，就在他出席哈尔滨全国工代的时候，一有空还注意学习新的技术。他说：“革命越闹越大啦，没见过的机器多着哩。不怕没用过，就怕不学习。只要和群众扭成一股劲，啥事情都能办好了！”\n    奋不顾身，永远前进，这正是英雄的本色，而甄荣典，这个三十一岁的劳动旗手，说起话来又是那样虚心、朴素、闪烁着信心。\n    甄荣典河北唐县人，贫农的儿子，十七岁就在粤汉路做苦工，在社会饱经风霜，他有着高度的阶级的觉悟。\n  （摘自东北日报）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st—Recently in Harbin City, a small number of industrial and commercial owners have openly violated laws and regulations, illegally seeking profits, and even using the excuse of developing production to oppress workers and apprentices. The municipal government has punished them separately according to the law. This kind of handling by the government has attracted the attention of all relevant parties, who believe that it is very necessary to correctly implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production.\n\nThe managers of the Tianzhucheng Iron Factory, Hu Jinyin and Cao Zhijun, constantly beat and scolded workers, and used feudal methods such as forcing apprentices to kneel to oppress them, extending working hours to as long as eighteen hours without paying overtime. Sui Yingsan, the manager of the Zhenxingxiang Iron Factory, arbitrarily mistreated apprentices, extending working hours to fourteen hours. Yu Li, the female owner of Yongxing Furnace, was dissatisfied with worker Xu Xuewen's learning, and scolded him. When Xu questioned her, Li used a wooden stick to injure Xu's face. Ma Guoliang, the director of the Dongxing Clothing Factory, contracted to dismantle and wash 400 cotton coats for the Northeast Military Supply Department. Ma ordered the workers to use two liang less cotton per coat, stealing a total of eighty jin of cotton. The factory also contracted to produce more than 500 sets of uniforms for workers at the Dongsheng Textile Factory. Ma personally cut the fabric, stealing more than 170 chi of cloth. At the same time, the factory extended production time to sixteen hours a day and deliberately delayed wage payments, using the wages for speculative business. The above incidents were exposed by the trade union, and the district government, trade union, military supply bureau, industry and commerce bureau, and both labor and capital were invited to a meeting to discuss them. Ma still stubbornly defended himself, so the trade union filed a lawsuit with the court. After the Harbin Municipal Court tried and confirmed the above-mentioned illegal acts of the above-mentioned owners, they were sentenced to detention for one to two months, and Ma Guoliang was sentenced to return the stolen cotton and cloth to the original owners.\n\nFurthermore, in June, Guo Jinyin, the director of the Jinji Shoe Factory in the city, made 10,000 pairs of \"Ula\" (shoes made of Ula grass, which are very warm) for the Songjiang Forestry Bureau. Both parties agreed on the weight of the \"Ula,\" but Guo ordered the workers to brush syrup on the leather to make up the weight, and it was still not up to standard. The factory also used inferior cloth to replace the fabric when making military shoes for the Liaobei Military Region. The above two points were exposed by the factory's workers and confirmed by the court's investigation. The court held that the factory owner had harmed military production and illegally sought profits, and should have been sentenced to imprisonment. However, considering that this was his first offense, the punishment was reduced, and he was fined 20 million yuan. In addition, some factory owners in the clothing and military shoe industries in Daoli District and Xinyang District of Harbin City also had behaviors such as delaying or deducting wages, unreasonably dismissing workers, and cutting corners. After being discovered by the joint association of the clothing and shoe industries in the two districts, in order to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and establish correct labor-capital relations, worker representatives were sent to negotiate with the factory owners separately. After both parties debated, and with the on-site witnessing of all relevant parties, the factory owners admitted their mistakes due to their unreasonableness, and returned the deducted wages in kind.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 哈市少数工商业主　偷工减料虐待工人\n\n1948-09-24\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　哈市少数工商业主\n  　偷工减料虐待工人\n    【新华社东北二十一日电】哈尔滨市最近有少数工商业主公然违反法令，非法牟利，甚至借口发展生产，压迫工人学徒。该市政府已依法分别予以惩处。政府此种处置已引起各有关方面的重视，认为对正确地贯彻劳资两利，发展生产的方针是非常必要的。\n    该市天祝成铁工厂经理胡金印、曹志钧，曾不断打骂工人，并用罚跪等封建办法欺压学徒，工作时间竟延长至十八小时，不给加班费。振兴祥铁工厂经理隋英三随意虐待学徒，延长工作时间至十四小时。永兴炉女掌柜于李氏不满工人许学文学习，出口大骂，许质问时，李氏即用木棒将许之面部打伤。东兴被服厂厂长马国良，承包拆洗东北军需处棉大衣四百件，马竟令工友每件少絮二两，从中偷花八十斤。该厂又承制东生纺织厂工人制服五百余套，经马亲自剪裁，偷布一百七十余尺。同时该厂生产时间每日延长至十六小时，故意迟发工资，将工资做投机生意。以上各节，经工会揭发，并邀请区政府、职工会、军需局、工商局及劳资双方开会讨论，而马仍强词狡辩，工会乃向法院起诉。上述各事件均经哈市法院审讯证实上述业主各项非法行为后，分别判处各该业主拘役一至两月，并判马国良将偷减的棉花与布料退还原主。\n    又讯：该市金记鞋厂厂长郭金印六月间为松江林务局做“乌拉”一万双（以乌拉草做的鞋，很温暖），双方订定“乌拉”重量，而郭竟令工人于皮上刷糖稀顶重量，且仍不够标准。该厂为辽北军区包作军鞋店，亦用劣布顶换。以上两节经该厂工人揭发，并经法院调查证实。法院以该厂主如此妨害军需生产，非法牟利，本应判处徒刑，但姑念其尚属初犯，减轻处分，罚款两千万元。此外，哈市道里区、新阳区被服军鞋业，亦有些厂主缓发或克扣工资，无理解雇工人和偷工减料等行为。经两区被服及鞋业联合会发现后，为贯彻劳资两利方针，建立劳资正确关系，乃派工人代表分别与厂方进行交涉。经双方辩论，并请各有关方面当场见证，厂方以理曲，承认错误后并将克扣工资折合实物赔还人。"

    "title": "Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-24",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Short Commentary\n\n　　Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit\n\n    Today's news broadcast by this agency regarding labor-capital relations in Harbin reflects that while the correct policy of \"developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital\" is being universally promoted in various liberated areas, achieving remarkable results in production and construction campaigns, there are still some private industrialists and business owners who distort government policies, arbitrarily infringe upon the legitimate rights of workers and apprentices, and violate the interests of the People's Government. This situation has also been found in other liberated areas and deserves attention.\n\n    \"Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit\" is the basic principle of the New Democratic People's Government in handling labor-capital relations. The so-called \"mutual benefit\" means that, in order to achieve the goals of \"developing production and promoting economic prosperity,\" the interests of both labor and capital must be taken into account simultaneously, and the interests of either party cannot be considered at the expense of the other. In the past, many places mistakenly overemphasized the temporary interests of the workers, neglecting the interests of capital, causing capital to be unprofitable, and even mistakenly applying the methods of anti-feudal struggle in rural areas to ordinary capitalists. The indirect or direct results of these erroneous actions not only harmed ordinary capitalists but also more seriously harmed the workers themselves. This \"leftist\" deviation has been or is being corrected in various places recently, and as long as it continues to exist, it must continue to be corrected. However, equally important is the need to oppose and prevent another deviation, namely, one-sidedly emphasizing the interests of capital, condoning illegal and undisciplined behavior by capital, infringing upon the legal rights of workers without interference, and even sacrificing the basic interests of the workers. This also violates the basic principle of labor-capital mutual benefit.\n\n    The liberated New Democratic government, in the past, present, and even for a long period after the national victory of the revolution, while resolutely implementing the policy of eliminating bureaucratic capitalism, allows the existence of general capitalist economy and protects all private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy. But it must be pointed out that the capitalist industry and commerce allowed and protected by the New Democratic government are only those that benefit the national economy, only their legitimate business operations. If there are elements that undermine the national economy or behaviors that violate laws and regulations, they are naturally not allowed or protected, but should be prohibited and subject to appropriate legal sanctions. Acknowledging that the free bourgeoisie occupies a certain position in the economic and political organization of the New Democracy does not mean abolishing or relaxing the economic leadership of state-owned enterprises and the political leadership of the proletariat, or inappropriately raising the status of capitalists above workers and peasants, oppressing workers and peasants. Protecting the legitimate interests of industrialists and business owners does not mean that we should therefore unconditionally assist their operations that are detrimental to the national economy, or that we can ignore ensuring the various rights that workers should enjoy.\n\n    Therefore, in dealing with labor-capital relations, party and government leading organs at all levels must correctly implement the policy of \"labor-capital mutual benefit,\" and oppose both \"leftist\" and rightist deviations. We must both protect the interests of the workers and appropriately take care of the interests of capital; we must both appropriately protect the free bourgeoisie economically and politically; but when they have erroneous behaviors that violate the interests of the people and their government, we must also carry out appropriate struggles to ensure that the politics and economy of the country and society develop smoothly in the right direction that benefits the entire people. Wherever there are \"leftist\" errors, workers should be persuaded to take care of their long-term interests and correct this error; where capitalists violate policies and laws, the capitalists should be persuaded or ordered to abide by policies and laws. For the few who disobey persuasion, knowingly commit violations, or feign compliance, the government and relevant departments should impose effective sanctions according to the severity of the circumstances and in accordance with the law. However, at the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to preventing the repetition of \"leftist\" errors, and not to adopt a policy of attacking and undermining the legitimate business operations of all small and medium-sized capitalists that are beneficial to the national economy, instead of adopting a policy of resolute protection. All relevant leading organs should pay attention to preventing the occurrence of any of the above-mentioned deviations at all times and in all places, and ensure the correct implementation of the policy of \"developing production, promoting economic prosperity, considering both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital.\" However, if such two-sided struggles are not carried out in society, if such two-line struggles against \"leftism\" and rightism are not carried out in party and government organs, then the correct implementation of this policy cannot be guaranteed, the New Democratic economy cannot be developed, and either the error of agricultural socialism or the error of the capitalist road will be committed. This is what all communists and revolutionary cadres must understand.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 正确执行劳资两利方针\n\n1948-09-24\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社短评\n\n　　正确执行劳资两利方针\n    今天本社所广播的关于哈尔滨市劳资关系的消息中，反映解放区各地在普遍推广“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的正确政策并获得显著成效的生产建设运动当中，尚有部分私营工商业主曲解政府政策，任意侵犯工人学徒正当权利和侵犯人民政府利益的违法行为。这个情况在其他解放区也有发现，值得提起注意。\n    “劳资两利”，是新民主主义的人民政府处理劳资关系的基本方针。所谓“两利”，就是说，为达到“发展生产，繁荣经济”的目的，必须同时兼顾劳资双方的利益，而不能只顾劳资任何一方而不顾对方的利益。过去许多地方，曾经错误地过分强调了工人一方面的暂时利益，忽视了资方利益，致使资方无利可图，甚至错误地搬用农村反封建斗争的方法来对付普通资本家，这些错误行动的间接或直接结果，不但损害了普通资本家，而且更严重地损害了工人本身。这种左的错误的偏向，近来各地都已纠正或正在纠正中，只要它继续存在，也还要继续纠正。但是，同样重要的，就是必须反对与防止另一种偏向，即是片面地强调资方利益，纵容资方违法犯纪，侵犯工人的法定权利而不加干涉，以至牺牲工人方面的基本利益。这也是违背了劳资两利的基本方针。\n    解放了新民主政府，在过去、现在乃至将来革命在全国胜利以后的一个长时期内，与坚决执行消灭官僚资本主义政策同时，是允许一般资本主义经济的存在，是保护一切有益于国民经济的私营工商业的。但必须指出，新民主政府所允许和保护的，只是一切利益于国民经济的资本主义工商业，只是其合法的营业。如果其中有破坏国民经济的成份，有违反法令的行为，自然不在被允许保护之列，而应受到禁止与法律上适当的制裁。承认自由资产阶级在新民主主义的经济和政治组织中占一定的位置，并不等于取消或放松国家企业的经济领导和无产阶级的政治领导，或者把资本家的地位不适当地抬价到工人、农民之上，压迫工人农民。保护工商业主合法的正当的利益，并不是说因此就应该去无原则地有助其不利于国民经济的经营，就可以不注意保障工人应享有的各种权利。\n    因此，在处理劳资关系问题上，各地党政领导机关，必须正确执行“劳资两利”的方针，反对“左”的和右的两种偏向。既要保障工人利益，又要适当地照顾资方利益，既要在经济上政治上适当地保护自由资产阶级；但当他们有违反人民及其政府利益的错误行为时，又必须进行适当的斗争，才能保证国家和社会的政治与经济循着有利于全体人民的正确方向顺利发展。凡是存在着“左”倾错误的地方，应说服工人照顾长远的利益纠正这种错误，在发生资本家违反政策法令事情的地方，则应劝导或命令资方遵守政策法令。对于少数不服劝导明知故犯或阳奉阴违的分子，则应由政府及有关方面分别轻重依法予以有效的处置。但是同时又须注意，不要由此而又重复左的错误，对于一切有益国民经济的中小资本家的合法营业，不采取坚决保护的方针而采取打击破坏的方针。一切有关的领导机关，应随时随地注意防止上述任何一种偏向的发生，保证“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的政策的正确执行。但是，如果在社会上不进行这样两方面的斗争，如果在党政机关中不进行这样反左与反右的两条战线斗争，那就不能保证这个政策的正确执行，就不能发展新民主主义的经济，就或者要犯农业社会主义的错误，或者要犯资本主义路线的错误。这是一切共产党员和革命干部必须了解的。"

He frankly pointed out that before unification, \"the Polish Socialist Party must be ideologically united tightly and must understand that ideological education must be formed in the struggle against the right wing, against its bad habits and bad traditions.\" According to the Teletype correspondent in Warsaw, although the Central Executive Committee of the Polish Socialist Party may not unanimously accept the Workers' Party's condemnation of opportunist and chauvinist tendencies within both parties, the vast majority of the plenary session will bravely take the same measures as the Workers' Party, purging unsound elements from the party, and laying the ideological foundation for unification with the Workers' Party.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 波社会党举行中央全会　讨论波工人党中央决议\n\n1948-09-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　波社会党举行中央全会\n  　讨论波工人党中央决议\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】电通社讯：波兰社会党中央执行委员会于九月十七日举行全会，讨论波兰工人党中央委员会关于党内右倾倾向的决议，特别是讨论这个决议所批评的哥穆尔卡在与社会党统一问题上的错误观点，即“与整个社会党实现组织上的统一而不清除其右翼的倾向”。早在八月二十日，波兰社会党总书记西伦凯维兹（现任波兰总理）即会发表演说，着重指出：两工人政党必须以共同的马列主义思想、苏联的经验与其他各国工人阶级政党的革命经验作为统一的基础。他坦白指出：在统一以前，“波兰社会党必须在思想上紧密无间的团结起来，而且必须了解：在思想上的教育必须在与右翼、与它的坏习气及坏传统所进行的斗争中形成起来。”据电通社驻华沙记者估计，波兰社会党中央执行委员会虽不能一致接受工人党对两党内的机会主义与沙文主义倾向的斥责，但全会的绝大多数必将勇敢地采取与工人党同样的措施，清洗不健全的分子出党，而奠定与工人党统一的思想基础。"

    "content": "Defining the Future Direction and Tasks of Literary and Artistic Work\n  　North China Literary and Art Workers Gather\n    Two Regional Literary Federations Merge to Form the North China Literary and Art Association\n    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The North China Literary and Art Workers Conference, jointly convened by the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji Regional Literary Federations, was held on August 8th in a certain location in North China. Attendees included Xiao San, Sha Kefu, He Luting, Zhang Zhixiang, Shang Yue, Zhou Yang, Ai Siqi, Ai Qing, Zhao Shuli, Huang Gang, Wu Liren, Ouyang Shan, Li Bozhao, Tian Jian, Li Helin, Gao Muhong, Guang Weiran, Ruan Zhangjing, Jiang Feng, Hu Yichuan, Hu Man, Ding Li, Zhou Weizhi, Wang Lin, Wang Yang, Shu Qiang, Cui Sou, Shao Wei, Liu Yumin, Wang Xuebo, Chen Qixia, Kang Tuo, Meng Bo, Li Huanzhi, Sun Li, A Jia, Luo Heru, and over sixty other comrades, as well as Mr. Ma Yanxiang, a famous playwright who recently came from the KMT-controlled areas, and Ms. Yao Jinxin, a musician, and Comrade Ke Zhongping, director of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Literary Association and poet, who will soon be returning to the Northwest. The conference lasted twelve days, with extremely enthusiastic discussions. Finally, Comrade Zhou Yang made a concluding speech, and Comrade Bo Yibo also attended and delivered a speech. Through discussions, everyone reached a consensus on the future direction, tasks, and specific methods of literary and artistic work in North China. At the meeting, the merger of the two regional literary federations was officially announced, and the unified North China Literary and Art Association was established. The constitution was adopted, and directors were elected. The conference concluded on the 19th.\n    The conference reviewed past work and concluded that North China's literary and artistic workers had accomplished a great deal and achieved successes during the extremely tense two-plus years of the People's Liberation War, land reform, and party rectification. A considerable number of literary and artistic cadres directly participated in the war. The Anti-Enemy Drama Society of the North China Military Region and other troop drama societies, under the spirit of \"serving the soldiers,\" went deep into companies and platoons, lived with the soldiers, set up propaganda booths on the front lines, carried out various propaganda activities, and helped carry stretchers to rescue the wounded. As a result, they not only learned the appearance and language of the soldiers but, more importantly, experienced the soldiers' inner emotions and thoughts, which made their plays and songs full of the colors of the people's army. Frontline reporters also produced a number of outstanding war dispatches and reports. The vast majority of literary and artistic workers participated in the land reform movement, writing many stories, plays, poems, and songs about the peasants' liberation. In the past two or three years, relatively successful works reflecting the People's Liberation War, land reform, and the history of the War of Resistance Against Japan include, in drama: \"Chiye River\" (Ruan Zhangjing), \"Unite and Make Meritorious Contributions\" (Frontline Drama Society), \"Wang Keqin Squad,\" \"Two Styles of Work\" (Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Cultural Troupe), \"Changing the Old Style of Work\" (Taihang Guangming Drama Troupe), \"Don't Kill Him\" (Anti-Enemy Drama Society), \"Happy Reunion\" (Hu Ke), \"Baoshan Joins the Army\" (Mass Drama Society), \"Qin Luozheng's Transformation\" (He Jingzhi), etc.; in novels, communications, and reports: \"Fu Gui,\" \"Floorboard\" (Zhao Shuli), \"Blood on the Sleeve\" (Li Wenbo), \"Hatred\" (Wang Nan), \"Hatred\" (Li Zhuang), \"Zhang Kuhai Digs Out the Roots of Poverty\" (Ge Fei), \"Li Jiagou's Anti-Maintenance Record\" (Yuan Chao), \"Hero Gully\" (Zheng Du), \"Tian Shui Ling Masses Turn Over\" (Zhu Xiang), \"Old Zhao Goes to the Countryside\" (Yu Lin), etc., as well as reports on the Longfeng Battle, the Huajun Battle, the Qingfengdian Battle, and the Liu-Deng Army's southward march, etc.; in poetry: \"Trap\" (Ruan Zhangjing), \"Driving the Cart\" (Tian Jian), \"Wang Zhang's Complaint,\" \"Can't Die\" (Zhang Zhimin), \"Ballad Singer Wang Xiaowu\" (Liu Yanzhou), etc. In addition, the large number of peasant liberation stories and liberation poems recorded by literary and artistic workers and intellectuals, many of which are excellent mass creations, especially the liberation poems, greatly enriched the treasure trove of Chinese folk songs. In painting, not only were new New Year pictures and foreign films widely promoted, but also new creations such as Cai Ruohong's \"Where Does Suffering Come From?\" and \"People Who Confiscated Land,\" as well as other woodcut paintings, were produced. Although some of the above-mentioned works still have some shortcomings in terms of theme or presentation methods, they have all gained a considerable number of readers and viewers. The pictorial and film of the North China Military Region have both made achievements. The Literary and Art Institute of North China University and its cultural troupe have done a lot of work in cultivating and improving literary and artistic cadres, guiding and training rural troupes, and conducting literary and artistic propaganda in newly liberated cities. The work of the Jin-Lu-Yu Literary Federation in organizing and transforming folk artists is commendable.\n  Future Literary and Artistic Work Tasks: To Reflect the Liberation War and Industrial and Agricultural Production and Construction More and Better\n    While correctly assessing past achievements, the conference considered these achievements to be insufficient. Today, literary and artistic work still lags behind the needs of the great People's Liberation War and the construction of the liberated areas. The conference proposed that the future tasks of literary and artistic work must first and foremost be to reflect the People's Liberation War, land reform, and production and construction more and better. Comrade Bo Yibo pointed out in his speech that the people paid an extremely high price to win the victory of the Liberation War, and there were countless heroic deeds worth singing and crying about in the war, demanding that literary and artistic workers faithfully record them. When mentioning industrial and agricultural production, he asked writers to learn to describe industrial themes. In recent years, many literary and artistic workers have gone to the countryside and joined the army, but they have created relatively little. Some literary and artistic workers are distressed because they cannot write works or write works that have no opportunity to be published, and some even want to change careers. Some comrades say that the reason for this phenomenon is that the standards for works are too strict, with too much criticism and too little encouragement, which makes authors afraid to write. After repeated discussions, everyone believed that in the past, the organized and planned promotion and encouragement of creation was indeed insufficient. On the other hand, although some literary and artistic workers have integrated with the masses relatively well, generally speaking, the integration with the masses is still far from enough. Therefore, their ability to faithfully, concretely, and profoundly reflect the actual struggles of the masses is still relatively weak, especially in terms of portraying new and active figures among the masses and expressing the leading role of the Communist Party in the mass movement. Regarding the issue of reflecting life and grasping policies, the conference, after discussion, realized that the two are unified. To understand and reflect the situation of the masses, one must understand the policies, because policies are the foundation of the life of the new social system. At the same time, only by understanding the situation of the masses can the understanding and reflection of policies be concrete and profound. The publicity of policies in literary and artistic works must proceed from reality, not from policy provisions. It must focus on reflecting the various differences, even contradictions, among the masses of various regions and strata in the implementation of policies, reflecting the entire tortuous process of the masses from not understanding to understanding and even implementing our policies. Only in this way can literature and art truthfully reflect the situation and discover problems. Literature and art must combine the persistent publicity of the policies of the Party and the government with the comprehensive and in-depth reflection of the situation of the masses. The conference correctly pointed out that the ideological nature of literary and artistic works and their critical role in reality must be strengthened. This is the central link in improving the quality of works. Regarding the issue of form, everyone believed that it is necessary to continue to learn from folk forms and further transform and improve them; everything in the Chinese and foreign heritage that is useful to us must be adopted. More attempts and creations that are needed and beneficial must be made in terms of form, but any form must strive to be accepted and loved by the masses. Zhao Shuli's works are particularly worthy of everyone's learning. Regarding the issue of the combination of literary and artistic workers with practice, various different methods can be adopted according to specific circumstances. Everyone believed that creators need to do certain practical work. Work related to writing, such as that of news reporters, is the most suitable.\n    Strengthen Guidance on Popularization Work\n    Meet the Needs of the Broad Masses\n    Secondly, the conference believed that guidance on popularization work must be strengthened. The relationship between improvement and popularization is still not regular. On the one hand, some literary and artistic workers are distressed because they cannot write works, especially the relatively improved works they idealize. On the other hand, a large number of literary and artistic workers in troops and localities are distressed by their inability to improve after working at the grassroots level for a long time. According to preliminary statistics, there are about fifty professional drama troupes or cultural troupes in the North China Liberated Area, with nearly three thousand drama workers. This is a large force. They perform regularly among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they very much hope that literary and artistic figures who do improvement work will help them summarize their experiences, revise their scripts, and \"improve\" them. But they get too little help. After the intense struggles of land reform and party rectification, the masses in the basic areas urgently need rest and entertainment, and the current popularization work is far from meeting the needs of the masses. The trend of performing old operas is very prevalent in the countryside in various places. In the newly liberated cities, old operas almost dominate. There are seven old opera troupes in Shijiazhuang (including Peking Opera, Hebei Bangzi, Shanxi Bangzi, Bengbeng Sixian, etc.), with more than five hundred old artists and about 20,000 viewers every day. These old artists have tried to compile some new programs, which are very popular, so they are very willing to accept new things, but unfortunately, there is very little help in this regard. As for rural troupes, they are very common in the old areas, and they urgently need to be reorganized and restored after land reform and party rectification. The training and transformation of folk artists need to be done by literary and artistic workers. In short, how to strengthen guidance on popularization work is the most important issue facing literary and artistic workers today. The conference unanimously agreed that the literary and art circles must strengthen guidance on popularization, and this guidance work must not be sporadic, incidental, and dispensable, but must be planned, systematic, and done with all efforts. This is not only for popularization but also for improvement. At present, a large amount of popularization is needed, and improvement based on popularization is also needed. The conference proposed that all literary and art groups in North China should strengthen the work of guiding popularization. The North China Academy of Literature and Art should be responsible for training troop and local drama troupes and improving existing literary and art cadres who do popularization work. The purpose and method of training must be suitable for the needs of popularization work. In addition to troop drama troupes, other drama troupes should adopt a business policy as much as possible in general performances, so that the troupes can gradually become self-sufficient and appropriately improve their lives. At the same time, it can ensure that the troupes do not simply become drama troupes of organs and schools but become truly mass drama troupes. Drama troupes at the North China level should establish a certain liaison system with local drama troupes to help local drama troupes in all aspects, and local drama troupes should also establish a liaison system with drama troupes in their respective regions, so that guidance is provided layer by layer and improved step by step. An important suggestion of this conference is to establish the North China Drama and Music Work Committee to strengthen and unify the guidance of the North China drama and music movement. The main tasks of the committee are: 1. To stipulate the central activities of drama in various periods, such as the Spring Festival activities, which must be prepared now. 2. To review old repertoires, revise old scripts, and provide new scripts. 3. To study and summarize the experiences of drama and music work in the troops and localities, as well as the experiences of reforming old dramas. The committee will devote great efforts to the work of reforming old dramas, not only reforming Peking Opera but also reforming local operas. Because local operas are closer to the folk, they are more vibrant and easier to reform. The future of the reform of local operas is very bright. Regarding scripts, on the one hand, new historical dramas must be created. On the other hand, what is more needed at present is to revise old scripts. Old scripts retain many vital things in the national culture. As long as the reactionary feudal parts are removed and new ideas and spirits are infused, they can \"bring forth the new through the old\" and give the old works a new life. This revision work itself is also a kind of creation.\n    Party, Government, and Military Leading Organs Should Strengthen Leadership over Literary and Artistic Work\n    Finally, on the issue of leadership, it was unanimously requested that the party, government, and military leading organs strengthen leadership over literary and artistic work, regard literary and artistic work as one of the important weapons of propaganda and education, and strengthen the work of literary and artistic criticism. Comrade Zhou Yang reviewed the past and stated that the concern and help for literary and artistic workers in creation, politics, and life were extremely insufficient, and must be corrected in the future. At the same time, he pointed out that the propaganda departments of party committees at all levels should set up special departments or designate special personnel to manage literary and artistic work, and literary and artistic workers themselves should also assume the responsibility of leading the literary and artistic movement. In the past, literary and artistic criticism was very weak and must be strengthened. Literary and artistic criticism should implement policies and ideas, represent the opinions of the broad masses and cadres, and fully combine the standards of experts with the standards of the masses. Such criticism is beneficial to the people and the writers.\n    Further News: The North China Literary and Art Association has elected Zhou Yang, Li Bozhao, Sha Kefu, He Luting, Ma Yanxiang, Zhou Weizhi, Ding Li, Zhao Shuli, Huang Gang, Cheng Fangwu, Xiao San, Guang Weiran, Ding Ling, Wang Yaping, Jiang Feng, Tian Jian, Ai Qing, Cai Ruohong, Ouyang Shan, Gao Muhong, and Li Huanzhi as twenty-one directors. Ma Da, A Jia, Li Helin, Wang Lin, Shu Qiang, Wang Yang, and Hu Man are seven alternate directors.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—Electone News Agency, Calcutta, 15th: News arriving here reveals that British intelligence agencies are behind the Karen people's rebellion in Burma, who are fighting for the establishment of an autonomous Karen State independent of the Burmese government. Reliable sources say that British personnel have been in contact with key figures of the Karen National Union (whose forces control the entire Salween region in southeastern Burma), urging them to continue their struggle for autonomy and promising that the Karen State will be recognized by Britain. This confirmation of British intelligence activity in the Burmese conflict leads observers here to assume that Britain will also support the movements of other tribes further north seeking autonomy—especially the Daibu and Kachin tribes. The aim of British personnel is to encourage various ethnic or disguised \"ethnic\" autonomous movements within Burma, in order to spread chaos and dissatisfaction among the Burmese people, and to divide and weaken the Burmese people's liberation movement, whose forces are waging an independent struggle for freedom against the British puppet government in Rangoon. It is pointed out that Britain can safely support such autonomous movements of backward tribes, which can establish a small regional government under permanent British control. Several leaders of the Karen National Union—especially those educated in Britain—have indicated their willingness to play this role. By interfering through orchestrating these small \"riots,\" Britain hopes to put the Burmese government in an embarrassing position and declare that the Burmese government is unable to maintain order within its own country. This will serve as a pretext to forcibly change the Burmese government (which is increasingly showing signs of instability in the face of the people's rebellion) and replace it with extreme right-wing political figures. Britain could then invite itself to send troops into Burma, using the same methods as in Malaya—using Spitfire fighter planes, the latest weapons, and barbaric \"headhunters\"—to suppress the liberation movement. This would be a complete exposure of the farcical \"independence\" treaty signed with the Burmese government this spring.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—TASS, Moscow: Commenting on the situation in Burma, Izvestia wrote: The national liberation movement, which has been developing in Burma for many years, is now increasingly taking the form of guerrilla warfare against the British colonialists and their agents in Burma. The declaration of martial law throughout Burma on August 20 is merely one indication of the joint operations being prepared by the British colonialists and Burmese reactionaries against the Burmese people's national liberation movement. At the same time, this illustrates the magnitude of the Burmese people's struggle for national independence.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 缅甸人民解放运动有增无已　英阴谋派军队入缅  站在克伦族人幕后散布混乱制造借口\n\n1948-09-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　缅甸人民解放运动有增无已\n  　英阴谋派军队入缅\n    站在克伦族人幕后散布混乱制造借口\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】电通社加尔各答十五日讯：到达此间的消息显示，英国情报机关正站在缅甸的克伦族人暴动的幕后，而该族人正为争取成立不属于缅甸政府之自治的克伦邦而战。可靠消息称，英国人员已与克伦族联盟的首脑人物相接触（这些人物的军队正控制着缅甸东南部萨尔温区的全境），力促他们继续自治斗争，并提出此一诺言，即克伦邦将会获得英国的承认。由于缅甸内争中英国情报机关活动之这一证实，此间人士认为，还可以假定英国将要支持更北的其他部族争取自治的运动——特别是大部及卡钦族。英国人员的目的，在于鼓励缅甸境内各种民族的或伪装“民族”的自治运动，以便在缅甸人民中间散布混乱与不满，并希望借此分裂与削弱缅甸人民的解放运动，此种运动的军队，正在进行争取自由反对仰光英国傀儡政府的独立斗争。人们指出，英国能够安全地支持落后部族的这种自治运动，此种部族能成立一个在英国永久支配下的小地区政府。克伦民族同盟若干领袖——特别是曾在英国受过教育的——已表示他们情愿扮演这种角色。英国借其对于主持这种小“暴动”之干涉，正希望使缅甸政府处于难堪的地位，并宣布缅政府无力在其自己的国家内维持秩序。这将会成为强行改变缅甸政府（在人民暴动的面前，该政府已日益现出其动摇不稳的迹象）并使极端右翼的政界人物替代该政府之借口。英国就能使自己被邀派遣军队进入缅甸，用与在马来亚所采取的相同的办法——用喷火式战斗机，最新式武器及野蛮的“猎头颅专家”——以镇压解放运动。这将会是今年春季与缅甸政府签订之滑稽的“独立”条约的完全暴露。\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报在评论缅甸情势时写道：已经在缅甸发展多年的民族解放运动，现在正在有增无减地采取游击战形式以反对英国殖民者及其在缅甸的代理人。八月二十日在缅甸全国颁布的戒严令，仅仅是英国殖民者及缅甸反动派准备中的反对缅甸人民民族解放运动的联合作战的迹象之一而已。同时，这说明了缅甸人民争取国家独立斗争规模的宏大。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-24",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th: Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave important instructions on the work of the Northwest Party newspapers at the Yan'an news workers' meeting commemorating \"September 1st\" Journalist Day. He first pointed out that the Masses Daily has made great progress in linking with reality and the masses since this spring, and encouraged everyone to further improve the newspaper in the current situation of revolutionary victory and development. They immediately conducted a specific review of the newspaper. He pointed out that a major problem in the newspaper's current communication work is that the quality of the manuscripts cannot keep up with the development of the quantity. This is reflected in the newspaper as fragmented and piecemeal news, with many enumerations of phenomena. Many manuscripts cannot systematically, centrally, and analytically reflect an event or a movement, so that readers cannot see the whole picture of the entire event or movement. Therefore, the role of enlightening and guiding work, and the role of exchanging experiences to improve and promote work are not great. In order to overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary to provide ideological, policy, and work-style guidance to correspondents; to help correspondents constantly study their business and specifically help them improve their writing skills from their own practical work; and to cultivate a large number of worker and peasant correspondents to transform readers into authors. Only by relying on such a foundation can we say that the newspaper is run by the whole Party.\n\nIn terms of editing, we must overcome the phenomena of no center, no system, and being scattered. To this end, the editing work must be combined with the research and summary work of the party, government, and military leadership organs at all levels in the border area. To achieve this, it is not enough to rely solely on reporter interviews, because they are not familiar with the overall situation of various departments. It is both laborious and impossible to grasp the center. Therefore, the party, government, and military organs at all levels must work together. However, if the various organs only provide the newspaper with immature materials without correct conclusions, it will still not be of great help to the work. In the future, we must summarize the work on a regular basis and provide the newspaper with mature materials so that it can be combined with reporter interviews. The Northwest Bureau will stipulate this system, and all agencies must implement it conscientiously. This is a win-win situation that will both improve the work of the leading organs and make the newspaper better.\n\nAt this point, Comrade Xi Zhongxun pointed out that the newspaper's insufficient reflection on the life of the troops is a major shortcoming. Armed struggle is the central link in the Party's leadership of all work today, and without military affairs, the newspaper cannot see the development of the revolutionary movement. Therefore, truthfully reflecting the situation of the troops is currently the most practical educational work. Overcoming the above weaknesses is an important task for the staff of the Masses Daily.\n\nComrade Xi Zhongxun believes that some comrades do not pay attention to and study the news in this area, but only like to read news from other distant areas, which is a manifestation of being divorced from reality and aiming too high. However, the newspaper should also examine whether it has really done a good job in running the newspaper. He pointed out that, in summary of the above reviews, in order to run the newspaper well, the reports must be closely combined with the Party's current tasks. After any new task is put forward, it should first be reflected in the newspaper, otherwise the role of the Party newspaper will be reduced. For example, after the Party Central Committee put forward the opposition to indiscipline and anarchy, there was very little reflection on this issue in the newspaper, which deserves attention and review. Therefore, how to better integrate the newspaper with reality is the first issue that the newspaper staff should pay serious attention to.\n\nComrade Xi Zhongxun then discussed the issue of reporters' style, the use of criticism and self-criticism, and the class position of the Party newspaper. He said: A good Party newspaper reporter must first be able to connect with the masses, go deep among the masses, and participate in practical work in a simple and down-to-earth manner. Even if they cannot do it themselves, they should at least take a look, talk to them, or hold a discussion; and avoid hearsay and conjecture. The exaggerated style of writing is extremely harmful, and the wording must be as realistic as possible. He cited a previous frontline communication as an example. In that communication, a soldier who continued to fight after being injured and blocked the wound with a towel was described as \"filling a ditch.\" Such a moving heroic deed was damaged by such exaggeration.\n\nHe emphasized that the newspaper does not show enough spirit of criticism and self-criticism. In addition, some comrades still have deviations in their understanding and use of this weapon, and lack a comprehensive and developmental perspective in conducting criticism and self-criticism. For example, the newspaper once criticized the work of a certain place that was working hard to improve its shortcomings without encouraging it to consolidate this progress, which poured cold water on it inappropriately. He pointed out that we do not need formalistic criticism and self-criticism, which will only turn the problem upside down and undermine the guiding role. The newspaper's criticism is the Party's criticism, and the editor's note should represent the opinion of the Northwest Bureau, so it cannot be added casually. All opinions and thoughts in the newspaper must conform to the will of the Northwest Bureau, and no opinions and thoughts that deviate from the Party's will are allowed. Only in this way can the Masses Daily become a good mouthpiece for the entire Northwest Party and the entire Northwest people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 西北局书记习仲勋同志指示　把党报再提高一步  有系统有中心有分析的反映运动全貌\n\n1948-09-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　西北局书记习仲勋同志指示\n  　把党报再提高一步\n    有系统有中心有分析的反映运动全貌\n    【新华社西北二十日电】中共中央西北局书记习仲勋，在延安新闻工作者纪念“九一”记者节会议上，对西北党报工作，作了重要的指示。他首先指出今春以来群众日报在联系实际、联系群众方面已有很大进步，勉励大家在目前革命胜利发展的形势下，把报纸再提高一步。他们即对该报作了具体检讨。他指出：目前该报通讯工作中的一个主要问题是稿件质量赶不上数量的发展。表现在报纸上消息零碎、片断，现象罗列多，很多稿件不能对一件事或一个运动，作有系统有中心有分析的反映，使读者不能看出整个事件或运动的全貌，因此对于工作的启发与指导作用和交流经验以改进与提高工作的作用不大。为克服这种缺点，必须对通讯员有思想、政策和工作方针的领导；要帮助通讯员经常钻研业务，十分具体地从通讯员本身实际工作中去帮助他们提高写作能力；要大量培养工农通讯员，把读者变为作者。只有依靠这样一个基础办报，才说得上是全党办报。\n    在编辑工作方面，要克服没有中心、没有系统和零散的现象。为此，必须使编辑工作和边区党政军各级领导机关的研究总结工作结合起来。要做到这一点，光靠记者采访是不够的，因为他们不熟悉各部门全盘情况，既费力又不能掌握中心。因之必须各级党、政、军机关共同努力。但如果各机关只供给报社不成熟的材料，没有正确的结论，对工作还是无大帮助。今后必须按期总结工作，供给报纸以成熟材料，使它与记者采访结合起来。西北局将规定这种制度，要各机关切实执行。这是一举两得的事，既可使领导机关的工作做好，报纸也会办得更好。\n    至此，习仲勋同志指出，报纸对部队生活反映不够，是一个很大缺点。武装斗争是今天党领导全部工作的中心环节，报纸离了军事，就看不出革命运动的发展。因此，真实地反映部队情况，是目前最有实际教育意义的工作。克服上述弱点，乃是群众日报社工作人员的一个重要任务。\n    习仲勋同志认为有些同志不重视与研究本区消息，只喜欢看远的别的地区的消息的现象，是一种脱离实际、好高鹜远思想的表现。但报社也应检讨是否真把报纸办好。他指出，综合上面的检讨，要办好报纸，必须使报导与党的当前任务密切结合起来。任何一个新的任务提出后，首先应在报纸上反映出来，否则就降低了党报的作用。比如党中央提出反对无纪律无政府状态后，报上对这个问题反映很少，就值得注意和检讨。因此如何更好的使报纸与实际密切结合，乃是报社工作人员首先应严重注意的问题。\n    习仲勋同志继论及记者作风、运用批评自我批评和党报的阶级立场问题。他说：一个好的党报记者，首先要能联系群众深入群众，朴素踏实地参加到实际工作中去，即使不能专门动手去做，起码也要看一看，谈一谈或者开个座谈会；切忌道听途说，捕风捉影。写作上的夸张作风是极有害的，用语必须力求切合实际。他举报上一篇前线通讯为例，那篇通讯中把受伤后继续杀敌的一个战士用毛巾堵伤口描写为“好象填塞一个水渠似的”。这样一个动人的英雄事迹，就被这样的夸张损坏了。\n    他着重指出报纸表现批评与自我批评的精神还不够。此外，某些同志对这一武器的认识和使用还有偏差，缺乏从全面、从发展的观点去进行批评和自我批评。如报上曾对正努力改进缺点的某地工作，不用鼓励的办法去巩固这种进步，而不恰当地加以批评，泼了冷水。他指出：我们不需要形式主义的批评与自我批评，这只会把问题颠倒起来，损害了指导作用。报纸的批评就是党的批评，报纸编者的按语应当代表西北局的意见，因此不能随随便便就按。报纸上一切言论思想，都要合乎西北局的意志，不允许有离开党的意志的言论思想。只有这样，群众日报才能成为全西北党的和全西北人民的良好的喉舌。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 21st. The joint conference of the CCP Western Henan District Committee and the military region's military rectification meeting have decided that the current central task of the district is: to unite the broad masses of the people in Western Henan and repel the counter-attack of the Kuomintang reactionaries, which is supported by force and combined with special agents, bandits, and local bullies within the liberated areas. The specific tasks are: 1. Strengthen the suppression of bandits and launch a powerful offensive with politics as the main and military as the auxiliary to eliminate the puppet bandits in the liberated areas, stabilize social order, and create the prerequisites for carrying out all other work. 2. Resolutely stop land reform, but firmly protect the vested interests of farmers; appropriate compensation should also be resolutely made for those who were wrongly struggled against and wrongly divided. 3. Initially determine the method and preparation steps for implementing rent and interest reduction in order to appropriately improve the people's living standards and provide the people with conditions for developing production. At the meeting, Zhang Xi, Secretary of the CCP Western Henan District Committee and Political Commissar of the Military Region, pointed out: The enemy's joint counter-attack is specifically manifested in armed sneak attacks, disrupting the rear, looting homes, creating rumors, and inciting people. The reason why the enemy can carry out this attempt to revive is due to certain shortcomings in our work. Many staff members, due to a series of victories of our army and the simplification of their understanding of the struggle against the enemy, have developed serious complacency and paralysis, which gave the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of and caused losses. He pointed out: Western Henan has already reached the scale of a revolutionary base area; due to the enemy's burning, killing, looting, and raping, resistance from the people has been universally aroused wherever they go; at the same time, there are sharp contradictions between the few chief culprits and the coerced followers within the bandit gangs; therefore, as long as everyone is ideologically prepared for the enemy's counter-attack, correctly grasps the policies, and organizes the forces well, we are fully confident that with the strength of the local military and civilians in Western Henan, we can eliminate the bandits and puppets in the controlled areas, repel the counter-attack, and vigorously carry out struggles in the border areas and advance outward. To this end, he called for strengthening policy study, uniting and cultivating cadres, especially cultivating a large number of local cadres, strengthening unified leadership, and overcoming the state of anarchy, disorganization, and indiscipline.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫西决定目前中心任务：  团结广大人民打退匪伪反扑　安定秩序实行双减改善民生\n\n1948-09-24\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫西决定目前中心任务：\n    团结广大人民打退匪伪反扑\n  　安定秩序实行双减改善民生\n    【新华社中原二十一日电】豫西解放区中共地委联席会议与军区整军会议已决定该区目前中心任务为：团结豫西广大人民，打退国民党反动集团以武力为支柱，结合解放区内的特务、土匪、土劣的联合反攻。具体工作为：一、加强剿匪，展开以政治为主军事为辅的强大攻势，肃清解放区内的伪匪，以安定社会秩序，造成开展其他一切工作的前提条件。二、坚决停止土地改革，但坚决保障农民既得利益；对斗错和分错的也坚决地作适当补偿。三、初步确定实行减租减息办法及准备步骤，以求适当改善人民生活，使人民有发展生产的条件。会上，中共豫西区党委书记兼军区政委张玺指出：敌人的联合反攻具体表现武装偷袭，扰乱后方，打家劫舍，制造谣言，煽惑人心。敌人所以能实行这种企图死灰复燃的反攻，乃由于我工作中有着某些缺点。不少工作人员由于我军一连串的胜利和对敌斗争的认识单纯化，产生严重的轻敌麻痹情绪，致予敌有机可乘，造成损失。他指出：豫西已具有革命根据地规模；由于敌人的大烧，大杀，大抢，大奸淫，因此所到之处即普遍引起人民的反抗；同时，匪众内部少数首恶与胁从者之间存在尖锐矛盾；因此，只要大家在思想上对敌人的反攻有准备，正确掌握政策，力量组织好，就完全有把握以豫西当地军民的力量，肃清控制区的匪伪、打退反攻，并可有力地开展边沿区斗争，向外推进。为此，他号召加强政策学习，团结与培养干部，特别要培养大批地方干部，加强一元化领导，克服无政府、无组织、无纪律状态。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd. In order to unify the Party's actions and oppose the state of disorganization and indiscipline within the Party, the struggle carried out by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been launched in a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army front. The Party Committee of the unit held an enlarged meeting a few days ago and decided to conduct ideological examination from top to bottom among leaders at all levels of the unit to correct some of the current state of disorganization and indiscipline. At the meeting, the Party Committee first reviewed that since the Party Central Committee put forward the opposition to anarchism and indiscipline, emphasized centralization and unity, and issued the resolution on the South Communist issue, although the unit has conveyed it to cadres at all levels and carried out some publicity and education at various meetings; the leading organs have never raised this issue of ideological construction with a Party-wide nature to the central link, and have not taken a certain amount of time to organize ideological reviews from top to bottom and fully launch ideological struggle. This is a concrete manifestation of extreme indiscipline to keep some important instructions of the Central Committee at the level of verbal propaganda. The Party Committee then pointed out the specific manifestations of disorganization and indiscipline in the unit. On the one hand, the general cadres lack research on the Party's policies and instructions from superiors, and there are habits of being rough and not seeking thorough understanding, as well as certain purely military viewpoints, lax military discipline, and chaotic systems; on the other hand, cadres at all levels have failed to regard making comprehensive reports to superiors as a matter of organizational concept and discipline. They do not have sufficient understanding of the great importance of reporting comprehensive information to superiors so that superiors can make various instructions in a timely manner and correct shortcomings in time, so that the work does not make or makes fewer mistakes. They think that as long as they act according to the instructions of their superiors, it does not matter if they do not report, or they use the excuse of not being able to write comprehensive reports, and some even have the idea of \"rather report less than report wrong.\" They often only rush to deal with it under the strict supervision of their superiors, so that it often happens that only the process is reported, lacking analysis or summary, or even only the beginning is reported and not the result. The objective reasons for these problems, in addition to the weak ability of the cadres, also lie in the fact that the leading organs do not conduct in-depth investigation and research on the situation, the instructions and plans for the subordinates are not carefully considered, there is a lot of work and the center is not clear, the requirements for work are not strict, problems cannot be investigated in time, and there is a lack of strict work discipline. Therefore, the Party Committee of the unit called on cadres at all levels to go deep into their work and make more comprehensive reports to their superiors, and especially decided to launch an ideological struggle against anarchism and indiscipline and various bad work styles in the troops, and conduct in-depth inspections in connection with the implementation of policies, systems, and military discipline. The focus of the inspection is on the Party committees above the regiment level and the main cadres and organs, carrying out strict criticism and self-criticism, and exposing the phenomena of anarchism and indiscipline and the shortcomings of leadership methods.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北某部党委召开扩大会议　检查无政府无纪律思想\n\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北某部党委召开扩大会议\n  　检查无政府无纪律思想\n    【新华社东北二十二日电】中共中央为了统一党的行动，反对党内无组织无纪律状态所进行的斗争，在东北人民解放军前线某部中展开了。该部党委会于日前召开扩大会议，决定在该部各级领导中进行从上而下的思想检查，以纠正目前存在着的某些无组织无纪律状态。会上，党委首先检讨自党中央提出反对无政府无纪律状态，强调集中统一，及发表关于南共问题的决议以来，该部虽对各级干部进行了传达，在各种会议上进行了一些宣传教育；但领导机关始终未把这一带有全党性的思想建设问题提高到中心环节的地位，拿出一定时间来组织自上而下的思想检讨，全力展开思想斗争。这是把中央的一些重要指示停留在口头宣传上，是一种极无纪律的具体表现。党委继即指出该部无组织无纪律状态的具体表现，一方面是：一般干部对党的政策、上级指示缺乏研究，存在着粗枝大叶不求甚解的习惯，及某些单纯军事观点、军纪松懈、制度紊乱等；另一方面是：各级干部未能把对上级作综合报告看成是组织观念和纪律问题。他们对于向上级反映全面情况，以便使上级能适时作出各种指示和及时纠正缺点，使工作不犯或少犯错误的巨大重要性认识不够，以为只要按照上级所指示的去作，不报告也没关系，或以不会写综合报告作借口，有的并存在着“宁少报，不报错”的想法。他们又往往只是在上级严格督促下才急于应付，以至经常发生只报告经过，缺乏分析或总结，甚至只报告开始不报告结果等等毛病。产生这些毛病的客观原因，除干部能力弱外，还在于领导机关对情况不作深入的调查研究致对，下级的指示、计划考虑不细致，工作多，中心不明确，对工作要求不严，发生问题不能及时追究，缺乏严格的工作纪律。因此，该部党委号召各级干部深入工作，对上级多作综合报告，并特别决定在部队中展开反对无政府无纪律状态及各种恶劣作风的思想斗争，联系执行政策、制度、军纪的情形作深入的检查。检查重点放在团以上党委及主要干部与机关部门，开展严格的批评与自我批评，揭发无政府无纪律的现象与领导方法的缺点。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: The Northeast Liberated Areas are actively welcoming the first harvest after the land reform. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Political Committee, and the provinces of Hejiang, Nenjiang, and Heilongjiang have all called on local areas to strengthen organizational leadership, mobilize all men, women, and children, and various livestock to cooperate with each other on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, and harvest in a timely manner to avoid damage to the grain from wind disasters, early frost, and early snow. Before and after the autumn harvest, all localities should organize farmers to carry out various sideline productions and prepare for next year's large-scale production, paying particular attention to accumulating fertilizer, collecting manure, selecting seeds, and increasing next year's grain yield. The Northeast Bureau's instructions emphasized: The local armed forces and main forces in the areas bordering the enemy should take the struggle to protect the autumn harvest and grain as their main task at present. The Hejiang Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government instructed leading cadres at all levels to immediately shift from other work to preparing for the autumn harvest. The joint instructions of the Nenjiang Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government required that practical assistance be given to elderly and widowed dependents of soldiers, dependents of martyrs, and dependents of war laborers to ensure that they can harvest in a timely manner without encountering difficulties. It is necessary to vigorously organize surplus labor in cities to sell labor to areas lacking labor and carry out crash harvesting. Rural branches and party members in various places, as well as labor models in production, should actively play a leading, exemplary, and bridging role to ensure the successful completion of the autumn harvest.\n    【Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 22nd】If there are no unexpected natural disasters before the autumn harvest, the Northeast Liberated Area is expected to complete the plan to increase production by 12% compared to last year. This is the result of developing production and initially overcoming natural disasters after the equal distribution of land. The main problems that still exist in the countryside are due to the remnants of past leftist influences, and because some cadres and peasant activists still have agricultural socialist-style absolute egalitarian ideas, many farmers are still worried about whether there will be \"re-distribution\" after they become wealthy through developing production. Some district and village cadres also regard the organization of farmers' labor to participate in mutual-aid plowing teams as a \"means of equalizing production,\" thinking that now is the time to \"share blessings, do work together, and in a communist country, it is not right to stand out; whoever stands out is unequal\"; and they use coercive methods to implement so-called \"universal organization,\" requiring \"the entire village to be incorporated into mutual-aid teams, not allowing a single household to work alone.\" In order to correct these erroneous concepts and put the development of production and the organization of labor on a sound track, the Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled \"Consolidate Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production, Improve the Organization of Mutual-Aid Plowing Teams.\" The editorial once again announced that in the basic areas, the anti-feudal struggle has been completed, the Party's policy is to determine land rights, allow and reward wealth through labor, allow free lending, wage labor, and tenancy under specific conditions, and strive to reduce the burden on the people as much as possible and make it fair and reasonable. Regarding the issue of organizing the masses for production, the editorial emphasized that it is necessary to adhere to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and to adopt gradual organization and gradual expansion based on the awareness and demands of the masses, resolutely opposing infringement on private property rights and the freedom of independent labor. The editorial pointed out: In order to achieve the goal of implementing the Party's correct policies, it is necessary to seize the current opportunity to universally hold short-term training classes for district and village cadres, summarize the experience of the production movement, correct the egalitarianism and commandism of cadres, and strengthen the education on various policies and work styles that are directly related to their work, in order to win the victory of this year's autumn harvest and lay a good foundation for next year's agricultural production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北积极迎接丰收  注意积肥选种提高明年粮食产量　纠正左倾残余加强政策作风教育\n\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北积极迎接丰收\n    注意积肥选种提高明年粮食产量\n  　纠正左倾残余加强政策作风教育\n    【新华社东北二十日电】东北解放区各地积极迎接土地改革后的第一个丰收。中共中央东北局、东北政委会农业部及合江、嫩江、黑龙江等省均号召各地加强组织领导，动员全体男女老少与各种畜力，在自愿与两利的基础上互助合作，及时收割，以免遭受风灾、早霜、早雪糟踏粮食。各地在秋收前后，并应组织农民进行各种副业生产，及准备明年大生产，特别注意积肥起粪，选种留种，提高明年粮食产量。东北局指示中强调指出：接敌区地方武装与主力部队，应把护秋护粮斗争，作为当前主要任务。合江省委、省府指示各级领导干部应立即从其他工作上转到准备秋收上来。嫩江省委、省府联合指示中，要求对孤寡军属、烈属、战勤家属等予以切实帮助，保证他们及时收割，不受困难。要大力组织城市多余劳力到缺少劳力的地区卖工，突击收割。各地农村支部与党员，生产中的劳模，应积极发挥领导、带头与桥梁作用，保证秋收圆满进行。\n    【新华社东北二十二日电】东北解放区在秋收前如无意外灾荒，可望完成较去年增产百分之十二的计划。这是平分土地后发展生产和初步战胜灾荒的结果。现在农村中还存在着的主要问题，就是由于过去左倾影响的残留，由于一部分干部和农民积极分子还有农业社会主义式的绝对平均思想，许多农民在发展生产当中仍然顾虑着发家之后会不会“再平分”。某些区村干部在组织农民的劳动力参加插犋换工时，也看成是“均产手段”，以为现在是“有福大家享，有活大家干，共产国家，不兴冒尖（出头），谁冒了尖，就是不平等”；并用强迫方法实行所谓“普遍组织起来”，要求“全村编入换工组，不让一家单独干”。为纠正这些错误观念，使发展生产、组织劳动力走上健全的轨道，东北日报在最近发表了“巩固农民生产热情，改善插犋换工组织”社论。该社论再一次宣布在基本区反封建斗争已经完成，党的政策是确定地权，允许并奖励劳动致富，允许自由借贷、雇佣劳动和特定条件下的租佃，以及力求可能的缩减人民负担，并使之公平合理。关于组织群众生产问题，社论强调必须坚持自愿两利的原则，必须在群众觉悟与要求的基础上采取逐步组织，逐步扩大的办法，坚决反对侵犯私有权与独立劳动自由权。社论指出：为了达到贯彻党的正确政策的目的，必须抓紧目前时机，普遍举办区村干部短期训练班，总结生产运动的经验，纠正干部中的平均主义和命令主义思想，加强与他们的工作有直接联系的各种政策作风的教育，以争取今年秋收的胜利，并给明年的农业生产打好基础。"

The company commander and political instructor had mutual rifts and uncoordinated work, which made the soldiers very anxious and concerned. Wang Yucai, chairman of the Soldiers' Committee, and Chen Yutian, member of the company's Party branch committee, under the inspiration of the battalion instructor, convened a joint meeting of the Soldiers' Committee and the branch committee to specifically discuss this issue. They objectively analyzed the main strengths and weaknesses of the political instructor and company commander, and the entire Soldiers' Committee members and branch committee members signed a report to the regiment's Party committee, requesting them to send someone to help improve the leadership. In their report, they cited the political instructor's merits of turning over the spoils of war to the public, caring for the masses, and caring for food, as well as shortcomings such as poor political cultivation, disunity with superiors and subordinates, and lack of composure in combat. For the company commander, they cited advantages such as good political cultivation, going deep into the lower levels, and composure in combat, as well as shortcomings such as being fond of sarcastic remarks and complaining. At the same time, it was pointed out that both of them were wrong in their disunity. After receiving the report, the regiment committee immediately sent people to the company to understand the situation and solicited the opinions of the instructor and company commander on the contents of the report one by one. The instructor and company commander both agreed with the strengths and weaknesses listed. A full company-wide enlarged meeting of squad leaders, deputy squad leaders, soldiers' committee members, and branch committee members was then convened, where the political instructor and company commander both made self-criticisms based on the facts, resolving the issue of their disunity. They both expressed gratitude for the help of the Soldiers' Committee.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中原某部第三连战士委员会　正确发扬民主改进领导  连长与政治指导员隔阂消除\n\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中原某部第三连战士委员会\n  　正确发扬民主改进领导\n    连长与政治指导员隔阂消除\n    【新华社中原二十二日电】中原解放军某团第三连的战士委员会，正确发扬集中领导下的民主，向领导机关提供意见，加强了该连政治指导员和连长的团结。该连连长和政治指导员互有隔阂，工作上不协调，战士们都非常着急和关心。战士委员会主席王玉才和该连党的支部委员陈玉田等，在营教导员的启示下，就召开了战士委员会及支部委员会联席会议，专门讨论了这个问题。他们客观地分析了政治指导员和连长的主要优缺点，由全体战士委员会委员和支委签名报告团的党委会，要求派人来帮助改进领导。他们在报告中，举出了政治指导员的缴获归公、关心群众、关心伙食等优点和政治修养差、对上下级不团结、战斗中不大沉着等缺点。对连长则举出了政治修养好、深入下层、战斗中沉着等优点和好说怪话、发牢骚等缺点。同时提出两人在不团结上都有不对的地方。团委于接到报告后立即派人到该连了解情况，将报告内容一一征求指导员与连长的意见。指导员与连长都同意了所列举的那些优缺点。于是召开了全连正副班长、战士委员和支委的扩大会议，政治指导员和连长都根据事实，作了自我检讨，解除了两人不团结的问题。他们对战士委员会的帮助均表谢。"

    "content": "Jinnan Daily Editorial Calls for\n  　Concrete and Specific Leadership in Wheat Planting\n    [Jinnan Electric] The Jinnan Daily recently published an editorial entitled \"Specifically Lead, Concretely Plan, and Complete the Wheat Planting Task.\" It began by stating: \"The wheat planting season is approaching. Although all regions in the district have emphasized leadership in wheat planting, most lack specific plans for wheat planting, specific work, and in-depth inspection. This will inevitably cause the work to remain at the level of empty slogans.\" The editorial proposed: \"The policy for wheat planting should be to strive to plant as much as possible. All reserved wheat land and early stubble land (good sorghum stubble) must be guaranteed to be planted in a timely manner, and late stubble should also be strived to be planted as early as possible. Some areas should also have planned organization of labor for reclaiming wasteland for wheat planting.\" All regions should put forward specific requirements according to the specific conditions of the local geology, such as the increase in yield per mu next year, the area and amount of wheat planting, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu, and the number of plowing and harrowing times before sowing, seed selection, etc. In addition to specific requirements, it is also necessary to further solve specific difficulties. In areas where the masses do not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer, it is estimated that the lack of fertilizer will be a major problem in wheat planting. It is necessary to call on the masses to accumulate and buy fertilizer. If it is really impossible to solve, it is necessary to plan for top dressing in the coming spring. In order to achieve more and earlier planting, it is necessary to solve the difficulties of manpower and animal power. On the one hand, do a good job in organization, and on the other hand, call on the masses to reduce unnecessary animal power consumption. Call on all agencies to lend their livestock to the masses during the wheat planting period. Call on women to participate in agricultural labor and organize manpower to pull plows and cultivators to solve the difficulties of human and animal power.\" The editorial finally pointed out: \"All regions must effectively promote district and village organizations and provide specific assistance to districts and villages. County and district leading organs must also conduct in-depth inspection and supervision, and discover and solve problems at any time.\"\n    [Jinnan Electric] More than a dozen counties including Baixiang, Guanxian, and Qinghe in Jinnan have successively issued instructions on wheat planting, calling on the masses to actively harvest autumn crops, deliver manure, turn the soil, organize mutual aid, and prepare for wheat planting. Many areas have already taken action. In order to solve the difficulty of animal power for the masses in wheat planting, the Second District of Yuanchao widely publicized the free lending of livestock, and the interest was determined by both parties. In addition, it educated village cadres and party members to consciously and voluntarily provide beneficial or non-beneficial loans to poor households, returned famine refugees, and elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households. The North Shenzhuang Farmers' Association in the Fourth District of Xin County called on the masses to plow, fertilize, and sun the land as they harvested, and plowed more than 190 mu of land in two days. Beixiabao in Guangping reclaimed 98 mu of wasteland in six days and collected more than 128,000 catties of thatch. The whole village is conducting a second plowing. In order to expand the wheat planting area, the Sixth District of Xiajin mobilized more than 1,000 civilians to dig ditches to divert water, so that the water could enter the Shahe River from Longwangkou. A command post was also established to provide work in exchange for relief. Linzhang County plans to strive to expand the wheat field by more than 80%. Qinghe County is preparing to expand more than double (last year was 1,000 hectares). In order to solve the difficulty of wheat seeds in the disaster area, Ningnan County's government lent out 120,000 catties of wheat seeds.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀南日报社论号召　切实具体领导种麦\n\n1948-09-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀南日报社论号召\n  　切实具体领导种麦\n    【冀南电】冀南日报顷以“具体领导切实计划完成种麦任务”为题，发表社论。首称：种麦季节将到，全区各地虽然重视了领导种麦，但大都缺乏种麦的具体计划，缺乏具体工作及深入检查。这样必然使工作停留在空口号召上。社论提出：种麦的方针，应是尽量争取多种，全部留麦地和早茬地（好高粱茬）要保证及时种好，晚茬也要尽量争取多种早种，某些地区还应有计划组织劳力开荒种麦。各地应按照当地的地质等具体条件，提出具体要求，如明年每亩增产要求，种麦面积和数目，每亩施肥多少，以及播种前犁、耙等次数、选种等，除具体要求外，还须进一步解决其具体困难。在群众没有积肥习惯的地区，估计种麦中肥料缺乏是个大问题，必须号召群众积肥买肥，如实在解决不了，要计划明春追肥。为了达到多种、早种，必须解决人力和畜力困难，一方面很好的进行组织工作，一方面号召群众节少不必要的畜力消耗。号召各个机关在种麦期间把牲口借给群众。号召妇女参加农业劳动，组织人力拉犁拉耧，以解决人畜力之困难。社论最后指出：各地必须切实推动区村组织，对区村予以具体帮助。县区领导机关，还必须深入检查督促，随时发现与解决问题。\n    【冀南电】冀南柏乡、冠县、清河等十几县相继发布种麦指示，号召群众积极收秋、送粪、翻土、组织互助、准备种麦后，不少地区已行动起来。元朝二区为解决群众种麦中畜力困难，广泛宣传自由出贷牲口，利息由双方自定。另外教育村干、党员自觉自愿的对贫户、逃荒归来户、老弱孤寡户做有利或无利借贷。莘县四区北沈庄农会号召群众随收随给随晒地，两天耠地一百九十余亩。广平北下堡六天开荒九十八亩，拾茅草十二万八千多斤。全村正在进行翻二遍地。夏津六区为扩大种麦面积，动员民力千余挖沟顺水，使水由龙王口入沙河。并成立了指挥部，以工代赈。临漳县计划争取扩大麦田百分之八十以上。清河县准备扩大一倍以上（去年为一千顷）。宁南县为解决灾区麦种困难，政府贷出麦种十二万斤。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Working Study\n\n　　How to Lead Spontaneous\n  　Small-Scale Mutual Aid Groups\n    Zhi Jian\n    This year, many areas in Taihang have seen the emergence of several spontaneous small-scale mutual aid groups in agricultural production. For instance, there are 26 such groups in Xihu Village, Wu'an; 28 in Huangguanying Village, Ci County. These mutual aid groups are widespread in the Sixth Administrative Region. Similar groups also exist in Gaoyi in the First Administrative Region, and Huguan in the Third Administrative Region. There are 14 such groups in Wubai Village (village name), Gaoyi, and more than 20 in Cangfang Village. These small-scale production mutual aid groups have various names, such as \"Cha Junzi\" (meaning sharing livestock for plowing), \"Da Boli Huo\" (meaning working shifts), and \"Boli Gongzu\" (meaning shift work group). These groups are mostly formed based on the needs of local agricultural work, with each group consisting of two to three or five to six households. The basis of their association is compatibility and shared sentiments, and some are relatives or brothers. Some involve mutual aid between those with good livestock and those with good labor, while most involve mutual aid between those with more labor and those with less, those with more farm tools and those with fewer, those with livestock and those without, those with skills and those without, and between poor and middle peasants. For example, the \"Cha Junzi\" between Lao Si and San Hei in Maliu Village, Gaoyi, involves Lao Si, who is a poor peasant and can weave, and San Hei, who is a middle peasant and cannot. The two families have been helping each other for more than ten years. Another example is Lao Dui in Wubai Village, who has twenty mu of land and one laborer, and Wang Zhen, who has thirty mu of land and also one laborer. Wang Zhen has a cart, waterwheel, and a full set of farm tools, as well as a large mule; Lao Dui only has a weak donkey. The two families have been helping each other for more than ten years. These mutual aid arrangements often lack a formal system, a leader, and hold few meetings. Matters are discussed during breaks or while working in the fields. Labor accounting is sometimes done by memory, and sometimes with copper coins. For example, in Lao Xiang's group in Dachun Village, Fifth District, Shahe, each person takes twenty copper coins, and each day is calculated as five \"shang\" (periods of work). Accounts are settled when a certain time has passed, and whoever has fewer copper coins contributes more labor.\n    Most of these mutual aid groups do not welcome the leadership of cadres, and some are even conducted in secret. A district cadre in She County said: \"When we go to the village to lead production, we see mutual aid groups in the fields, but when we ask about them in the village, they deny their existence.\" A district cadre working in Nanzhuang said: \"When we see people holding a meeting, they disperse as soon as we approach.\" The formation of these mutual aid groups is due to the fact that the masses of peasants want to overcome certain difficulties in individual production; on the other hand, it is also because we have had formalistic work styles in production leadership in the past. Some cadres organized mutual aid not through the voluntary participation of the masses, but through forced and rigid arrangements, imposing unrealistic production plans on the masses, forcing them to hold unnecessary meetings, and having those with labor provide uncompensated care for those without, even assigning village chores to the mutual aid groups. As a result, mutual aid did not allow them to do more work. They want to produce, don't want to waste time, don't want to be taken advantage of, and don't want to be constrained. This year, after emphasizing the opposition to commandism and formalism in production leadership, the masses spontaneously organized flexible and convenient small-scale mutual aid groups.\n    This fact shows that the masses' demand for organized mutual aid production is very urgent. If we do not conduct thorough investigations and research, and only superficially see that the masses' enthusiasm for the mutual aid organized by our leadership is not high, it would be completely wrong to believe that the masses do not want mutual aid. Our fundamental attitude towards this spontaneous small-scale mutual aid should be affirmative. Since the masses have the freedom to choose their production methods and organizational forms, and this small-scale mutual aid is the form that most of the masses can accept today, it should not be regarded as a feudal combination and opposed or disbanded. On the contrary, it should be cherished and helped, and gradually improved on the existing foundation.\n    For the specific leadership of these small-scale mutual aid groups, it is best to first go deep into a few groups, live and work with them (otherwise the peasants will not welcome us), and thoroughly understand its advantages, as well as its disadvantages. For example, mutual aid without labor accounting, unwillingness to express opinions face-to-face, each person having their own small calculations, which over time will lead to resentment and affect unity, the inability to plan and arrange labor-saving methods accurately, the inability to expand the scope, and the flexible mobilization for sideline production, etc. In this way, on the one hand, promote its advantages, such as democracy and fairness; on the other hand, introduce new experiences and methods from other more advanced mutual aid groups, allowing them to choose the parts that are suitable for themselves and can overcome some of their shortcomings, and gradually implement them. But never delay people's production because of \"leadership\", nor force people to accept this or that new system. It is entirely up to persuasion and the demonstration of good experiences, otherwise the leadership will inevitably fail, and we will be shut out by the masses, and even the mutual aid itself will be kept secret. After gaining experience in one or several groups, summarize it well, then formulate general methods, promote leadership, and widely propose new directions and methods that the masses can accept, to improve and develop more reasonable and beneficial mutual aid.\n    While deeply leading, we should widely publicize and educate about the policy of mutual aid—voluntary and equivalent exchange. So that the masses know that this is a definite and unchanging principle. If any cadres want to force the masses to adopt this or that production method, it is illegal. At the same time, conduct extensive and in-depth self-criticism of the past bad work styles in leadership, and conduct extensive and in-depth publicity of the past good examples and practices. Thoroughly examine and solve all the legacy issues under the old work styles in the past, so that the masses believe in our Party's mutual aid policy. Otherwise, spontaneous mutual aid groups will definitely use various methods to reject our leadership, or even collapse again.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 如何领导群众自发的　小型互助组\n志坚\n1948-09-25\n第1版()\n专栏：工作研究\n\n　　如何领导群众自发的\n  　小型互助组\n    志坚\n    今年太行不少地区发现群众生产中存在着若干自发的小型互助组，武安西湖村就有二十六个；磁县黄官营村有廿八个；在六专区这种互助组是普遍的。其他在一专区的高邑、三专区的壶关等县均有。高邑五百村（村名）有十四个，仓房村有二十多个。这种小型生产互助组的名称不一，有叫“插犋子”（即牲口插犋）、有叫“打拨活”，也有叫“拨工组”的。这些组多是根据各地农活需要组成，每组二三户至五六户不等。结合的基础都是对心思、合得来，亲戚本家弟兄在一起的也有。一部分是好牲口和好牲口、好劳力对好劳力互助，大多数是劳力多和劳力少、农具多和农具少、有牲口和无牲口、有技术和无技术、贫农和中农的互助。如高邑马留村老四和三黑的“插犋”，老四家是贫农，会织布，三黑家是中农，不会织布。两家在一起互助已经十多年了。又如五百村焦老对有二十亩地，一个劳力，王振有三十亩地也是一个劳力，王振有大车、水车、全套农具，大个骡子一头；老对只喂一个赖驴，两家在一起互助也是十余年了。这种互助多是没制度、没组长、开会少，有事抽空或在地里干活时就商量了。记工有的靠心记，也有用铜钱记的。如沙河五区大村老相组，每人拿二十个铜钱，每天按五晌计算，到一定时候算帐，谁的铜钱少谁就出工。\n    这些互助组大部分不欢迎干部领导，也有暗互助的。涉县有的区干部说：“咱去村领导生产，到地里见有互助，回村里问就没有了。”在南庄工作的区干部说：“见人家在开会，咱往跟前一走就散了。”这种互助组的形成，一方面是农民群众为了克服个体生产中若干困难；另方面是过去我们在生产领导上存在着形式主义作风，有的干部组织互助不是通过群众自觉自愿，而是强迫硬编，给群众订不合实际的生产计划，硬叫群众开不必要的会议，有劳力者无代价的照顾没劳力者，甚至把村上一些杂事都叫互助组去做。群众互助起来反倒不能多做活。他们要生产，不愿浪费时间，不愿吃亏，也不愿受拘束。今年强调反对了领导生产中的强迫命令和形式主义之后，群众就自发组织了灵活方便的小型互助组。\n    这事实说明群众对组织起来互助生产的要求是很迫切的，如果我们不深入调查研究，只是表象的看到群众对我们领导组织的互助热情不高，就认为群众不要求互助，是完全错误的。我们对待这种自发的小型互助的根本态度应该是肯定的。群众既然有选择生产方式与组织形式的自由，而这种小型互助又是今天大部群众所能接受的形式，那就不能把它看成封建的结合而加以反对和解散。相反，应加以爱护和帮助。并从现有的基础上逐渐把它提高。\n    对这些小型互助的具体领导，最好是先深入几个组，和他们生活劳动在一起（否则农民就不欢迎我们），彻底了解一下它的优点，也了解一下它的缺点。比方，互助不记工，有了意见当面不愿说，各人内心有自己的小算盘，久了会挽成疙瘩，影响团结，生产不上善于精确计划和安排省工，不能扩大范围，灵活调动做副业生产等。这样一方面发扬它的优点，如民主、公平等；一方面介绍一些别的较高级互助组的新经验、新办法，让他们选择适合于自己的、能克服自己某些缺点的部分，逐渐实行。但决不能因“领导”而耽误人家生产，也不能强制人家接受这样那样的新制度。完全要靠说服与好经验的示范，否则领导必然失败，被群众把我们关在门外，连互助本身都秘密起来。在一个组几个组取得了经验之后，好好总结一下，然后规定一般的方法，推广领导，普遍提出群众可能接受的新方向，新办法，提高与发展更合理、更有利益的互助。\n    与深入领导同时，我们应广泛宣传教育抚助政策——自愿等价。使群众都知道这是确实不变的原则。如果有的干部要强制群众采取这种那种生产方式，那就是不合法的。同时对过去领导中的不良作风进行广泛深入的检讨，对过去好的榜样和做法进行广泛深入的宣传。彻底检查与解决过去一切旧作风下的遗留问题，使群众们都相信我党的互助政策。不如此，自发的互助组就一定会用各种方法拒绝我们领导，甚至再次垮台。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Northeast, 22nd: A correspondent reports: How the strongholds stubbornly defended by the Kuomintang bandit troops and the liberated areas outside these strongholds are two different worlds is most sharply manifested in the comparison between Changchun today and the surrounding rural areas of Changchun. While Changchun is plunged into famine because the defending bandit troops refuse to lay down their weapons and carry out ruthless plunder, the boundless fields outside the city are presenting a scene of abundant harvest. The best crop is sorghum, generally over two people tall, with solid ears. Local farmers estimate that each hectare (ten acres) can yield about eight *shi* (approximately 800 kg), and at worst, no less than five *shi*. Although it cannot be said to be a perfect year, it is not far from it. Farmers have now harvested most of the corn, and millet is also beginning to be harvested. The residents of the suburbs, who have suffered from the looting of Chiang bandits and fallen into famine, are overjoyed at the sight of the autumn grain everywhere. In May of this year, when the People's Liberation Army entered the suburbs of Changchun, everything was desolate. The Kuomintang bandit troops robbed the masses of all their grain and property, dragged away herds of livestock, and kidnapped large numbers of young men and women, leaving behind a ruthless famine. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army, while eliminating the Chiang bandits around Changchun, assisted the democratic government in launching a wide-ranging production and disaster relief campaign, providing large amounts of grain and seeds to the masses and mobilizing them to rush planting. Various army units also launched a campaign to save and relieve disaster, and actively helped the masses with rush planting without any compensation. When livestock was insufficient, the soldiers personally pulled plows. A certain unit alone saved 15,000 *jin* of grain, contributed 15,000 labor days, and provided 40 livestock, which were distributed to poor farmers by the government. According to incomplete statistics, 70 percent of the land in the area was saved from being deserted due to the help of the troops in rush planting. In addition, the People's Liberation Army stipulated that each division should grow 350,000 *jin* of vegetables, all of which would be used to relieve the victims of the disaster. In this way, coupled with the full-scale disaster relief efforts of the democratic government, 200,000 disaster victims were finally rescued from the tragic situation of death and dispersal. Subsequently, various departments assisted the democratic government in launching a rush-weeding and rush-cultivating campaign, solving various difficulties such as grain, tools, manpower, and animal power for the masses, thus ensuring the abundant harvest this autumn. The local people are very clear: without the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government, there would be no abundant harvest in the vicinity of Changchun. Therefore, the local people widely spread the saying: \"The Central Army harms us to death, and the People's Liberation Army saves us to live.\" They also expressed their willingness to help the People's Liberation Army quickly take Changchun and rescue the starving citizens of Changchun.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 孤城内外两个世界  长春因匪军盘据掠夺陷于饥饿　城外辽阔田野上呈现丰收景象\n\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　孤城内外两个世界\n    长春因匪军盘据掠夺陷于饥饿\n  　城外辽阔田野上呈现丰收景象\n    【新华社东北二十二日电】分社记者报导：国民党匪军困守的据点与据点以外的解放区怎样是两个世界，正在今天的长春和长春周围农村的比较上最尖锐的表现出来。当长春因守城匪军拒绝放下武器并实行残酷掠夺而陷于饥饿时，城外一望无际的田野上正呈现着丰收景象。最好的是高粱，一般都有两人多高，穗头坚实，据当地农民估计，每垧（十亩）地可打八石左右，最坏也当在五石以上；虽不能说是十分年景，但也相差不远。现农民已将苞米大部收割，糜子也已开收。曾饱受蒋匪洗劫而陷于饥饿的城郊居民，眼看着满地秋粮，无不异常欣喜。今年五月，人民解放军进驻长春城郊的时候，到处是满目荒凉，国民党匪军抢光了群众所有的粮食财物，拉走了成群的牲口，抓去了大批青年男女，留下的是无情的饥荒。于是，解放军一面肃清长春周边蒋匪，一面协助民主政府发动广泛的生产救灾运动，大批给群众贷粮贷籽种，动员群众抢种。军队各个单位也掀起了节约救灾的热潮，并无代价地帮助群众积极抢种，牲畜不够，战士们就亲自拉犁，仅某部即节省粮食一万五千斤，帮助人工一万五千个，并拿出牲口四十匹，经政府发给贫苦农民。据不完全统计，该地区百分之七十的土地即系在部队帮助抢种之下，才得免于荒芜。此外解放军又规定每师种卅五万斤菜蔬，全部用以救济灾民。这样，配合了民主政府的全力救灾，终于使二十万灾民从死亡离散的悲惨情况中挽救过来。接着各部又协助民主政府发动抢铲抢趟运动，解决了群众粮食、工具、人力、畜力等各种困难，这样，才保证了今秋的丰稔。当地人民十分清楚；没有解放军和民主政府，便没有这长春近郊的丰收，因此当地人普遍流传着这样的话：“中央军害我们死，解放军救我们活。”他们并纷纷表示愿意帮助解放军迅速打下长春，解救饥饿的长春市民。"

The quality of 44-count yarn, the main product of the Northeast No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory, improved two-fold from the end of July compared to the beginning of May. In early May, there was one slub for every 400 yards, while at the end of July, there was only one slub for every 1,200 yards. Production at the end of July increased by 10% compared to May, and waste was reduced by two-thirds. Before the emulation drive, the Andong Textile Factory produced only 20 yards of cloth per machine per day, and the quality was poor. Now, each machine produces more than 40 yards of cloth, and the quality exceeds the standard. In the past, a cloth-pulling machine could pull 6,000 to 7,000 yards of cloth per machine per day, but now it can pull more than 14,000 yards. The Andong Rubber Factory, which is currently rushing to make cotton shoes, has seen most workers increase their daily output from 20 pairs to 40 pairs. Before the emulation drive, the shipyard needed 380 workdays to build one large ferry. Now, it only needs more than 190 workdays to build two. In order to promptly commend and reward meritorious workers, and to summarize the recent period of emulation drives to promote production, the factories have successively conducted merit evaluations and award ceremonies.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安东各厂立功运动效果显著　产量质量迅速提高\n\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安东各厂立功运动效果显著\n  　产量质量迅速提高\n    【新华社东北二十二日电】安东各工厂自开展生产立功运动以后，在提高产量、质量及减少废品上获得显著成绩。东北第一丝织厂主要产品四十四支细纱的质量，七月底较五月初提高两倍，五月初每四百码有一个疙疸，七月底的每一千二百码才有一个疙疸；七月底的产量较五月份增加了百分之十，废品减少了三分之二。安东纺织厂在立功运动前，每天一架机织布二十多码，质量也差，现在每架机织布四十多码，质量超过了标准。拉布机过去每天每机拉布六七千码，现在能拉一万四千多码。正突击做棉鞋的安东胶皮工厂，大部工人每天由做二十双增加到四十双。造船厂在立功运动前，造一只大渡船需工三百八十个，现在造两只需工一百九十多个。现各厂为及时表扬与奖励有功工人，并总结最近一个时期的立功运动，推进生产，已先后进行了评功和奖功。"

    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Northeast Dispatch:\n\n　　Andong Textile Factory\n  　Several Problems in the Production Merit Campaign\n  　Clarify the Purpose of the Production Merit Campaign\n    The purpose of the merit campaign is to clarify the concept of serving the people in the minds of the workers, to encourage and organize the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, to improve technology, to promote business, and to improve the quality and quantity of production a step further.\n    At the beginning of the mobilization of the merit campaign, there were many confused ideas among the workers. Some said, \"Anyway, they're just asking us to work more.\" \"We earn a day's wage for a day's work, what's the point of earning merit?\" Some argued, \"We worked the same way without setting plans in the past, what's the use of setting plans?\" Others excused themselves because of the different nature of their work and said they couldn't set plans. For example, the Construction Section stated: Auxiliary workers don't have specific fixed tasks, they just go wherever and whenever they are needed. Staff members of the General Affairs Section believed: \"The work is messy and miscellaneous, there's no way to set specific plans.\"\n    Based on these ideological situations, the factory leaders first mobilized among the cadres, gradually implemented it to the groups, and let the workers discuss and study it themselves. As a result, many confused ideas were resolved in the group discussions. For example, when the equipment installation workers in the Textile Section discussed it, they said, \"Let's hurry up and install more machines, so that many workers will have work to do and food to eat.\" Finally, they discussed how to install them quickly, and then they set a plan.\n  　Specifically Formulate Merit Plans\n    In the textile factory, the nature of various jobs is different except for the Textile Section, but each section is closely related and needs to cooperate well. Therefore, formulating a production merit plan is also a matter of resolving the relationship between each other and improving the quality and quantity of products.\n    How to start formulating a plan? Should we formulate individual plans first, or collective plans first? After discussion, it was decided to formulate collective plans first. First, the factory leadership studied the entire production task, researched ways to complete the task, and then each section discussed and determined its own plan, and then individuals formulated their own plans based on the plans of each section. The entire production merit plan revolves around the plan of the Textile Section. For example, the collective plan for the equipment installation part of the Textile Section is: 12,000 spindles should be installed by the end of June, and 8,000 spindles should be completed by the end of July. A total of 20,000 spindles should start initial operation by the end of July. Therefore, the collective plan of the Mechanical Section is to guarantee the supply of all parts, large and small, required for installation. The collective plan of the Construction Section is to guarantee the construction of the installation factory building. The collective plan of the General Affairs Section is to guarantee the full supply of all materials. In this way, the close cooperation between the departments was adjusted in the merit campaign, and merit was achieved in completing the tasks of each department.\n    After the collective merit plan is clarified, individual production merit plans are formulated according to each person's specific situation to ensure the completion of the entire collective plan. There are mainly the following issues when formulating the plan: (1) There must be a focus: For example, the maintenance workers of the opening and cleaning section of the Textile Section focus on checking and adjusting the machines to make them run smoothly and save raw materials. Therefore, the main conditions of the individual production plan are: (a) Frequently check and adjust the machines. (b) Save raw materials, so that the oil consumption is reduced by nine pounds compared with before. When pouring oil, pour frequently and less often. Machines with fast rotation speeds need to be poured more than twice a day. (c) Take care of the machines, clean them regularly, and do a major cleaning once a week. (2) It must be tailored to each person's specific situation. Merit standards should be stipulated separately for technicians and ordinary workers. For example, ordinary workers mainly improve their skills, and take care of tools and raw materials in the process of learning skills. Therefore, technical progress and care for raw materials and tools should be rewarded. Technicians mainly increase production, promote production, teach technology to others, play a leading role, and improve technology, etc., all of which should be conditions for recording merit. (3) The conditions for earning merit should not be too high or too low. They should mainly be based on the machine production volume and the existing technical level of the workers, taking into account that everyone can earn merit (of course, not by lowering the conditions for earning merit). (4) Inspire and encourage workers' creativity, so that workers use their brains and hands to improve their skills and master technology.\n  　Merit Campaign and Organization Leadership\n    Organizational leadership is an important part of the merit campaign. It is not only important at the beginning of the merit campaign, but also must be well led and controlled during the campaign. The entire factory established a merit committee, composed of the factory director, the chairman of the trade union, etc. The main task is to guide and control the entire merit campaign, and to assess and approve the merit grades on time. Each section established a merit branch, composed of the section chief, the branch chairman of the trade union, etc. The main task is to supervise the completion of the merit plan as scheduled, report the merit grades to the merit committee on time, and put forward opinions on the evaluation and determination of the merit grades; directly lead the merit groups in each section and group. The merit group is based on the trade union and administrative group, and is not reorganized separately. After the merit is evaluated, it is immediately announced to the workers; encourage and commend those who have done well, and put forward future directions for those who have not done enough, and help them quickly correct their shortcomings.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 安东纺织厂　生产立功运动的几个问题\n\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　安东纺织厂\n  　生产立功运动的几个问题\n  　明确生产立功运动目的\n    立功运动是为了使职工在思想上明确为人民服务的观念，鼓励和组织职工的劳动积极性和创造性，提高技术，推进业务，把生产的质量和数量提高一步。\n    在动员立功运动的开始，职工中有很多糊涂思想，有人说：“反正叫咱多干活。”“干一天总挣一天工资，立功干什么？”有的主张：“过去没订计划也是一样干，何用订计划？”也有的借口工作性质不同，不能订计划。如工事科提出：补助工没有具体固定任务，什么地方什么时候用着就去干。总务科职员认为：“工作零乱事务，没法订具体计划。”\n    根据这些思想情况，工厂的领导者首先在干部中进行动员，逐步贯彻到小组并由工人自己来讨论和研究，因之，在小组讨论中，解决了很多糊涂思想。如纺织科按装工人讨论时说：“咱们赶快干，多按几架机，能使很多工人有活干，有饭吃。”最后又讨论怎样快按装，于是便订了计划。\n  　具体订立功计划\n    在纺织厂来说，除纺织科外，各种工作性质都有所不同，但各科都是密切地联系着，都需要很好地配合起来。因此，订生产立功计划，也是解决互相间关系，提高产品质与量的问题。\n    怎样着手订计划？究竟先订个人计划，还是先订集体计划？经讨论后，决定先订集体计划。首先是厂的领导方面根据整个生产任务，研究出完成任务的办法后，各科再讨论、确定各科的计划，个人又根据各科计划，来订自己的计划。整个生产立功计划都围绕着纺织科的计划。如纺织科按装部分集体计划是：六月底要按装一万两千锭子，七月底完成按装八千锭子，总计至七月底两万锭子要开始初步运转。因此，机械科的集体计划便是保证供给按装上需要之一切大小零件。工事科集体计划就是保证按装厂房的建筑。总务科的集体计划就是保证一切材料的充分供给。这样在立功运动中，调整了各科密切配合的关系，在完成各科的任务上立功。\n    集体立功计划明确了之后，即按照每人具体情况订立个人生产立功计划，保证整个集体计划的完成。订计划时，主要有下面几个问题：（一）要有重点：如纺织科清花股保全工，重点是检查调整机器，使之顺利生产，而又节省原料。因此个人生产计划，主要条件是：（甲）经常检查及调整机器。（乙）节省原料，使油料比以前节省九斤。在浇油时，勤浇少浇，回转数快的机器，每日需浇两次以上。（丙）爱护机器，定斯扫除，每星期大扫除一次。（二）要切合每个人的具体情况。技术工与普通工，都要分别规定立功标准。如普通工主要是提高技术，在学习技术过程中，爱护工具和原料。因此，技术进步和爱护原料工具，都应记功。技术工主要是增加生产，推动生产，把技术教给别人，起带头作用，改进技术等，这些都应为记功条件。（三）立功条件，不要过高或过低，主要还应根据机器生产量和工人的技术现有水平来订，照顾到人人都能立功（当然不是降低立功条件）。（四）启发和鼓励工人的创造，使工人用脑用手提高技术，熟练技术。\n  　立功运动与组织领导\n    组织领导，是立功运动中重要的一环，不仅在开展立功运动开始，就是在运动中，也要很好领导掌握。全厂成立立功委员会，以厂长工会会长等为委员组成。主要任务是指导与掌握整个立功运动，按时评定和批准立功等级。各科成立立功支会，以科长工会支会长等组成，主要任务是督促如期完成立功计划，按时将立功等级报告立功委员会，并提出评订立功等级的意见；直接领导各科股立功小组。立功小组，以工会和行政小组为基础，不另编组。评功后，立刻向工人宣布；进行鼓励表扬，作得不够的，要提出今后方向，帮助迅速改正缺点。　　　（新华社东北电）"

    "content": "After the Liberation of Shouyang\n\n  　Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce All Improved\n    [Jinzhong News] Most areas of Shouyang were long occupied by the Japanese invaders. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they were invaded again by the Yan bandit army. Under their tyrannical rule, industry and commerce were almost completely destroyed. All eleven well-known market towns in the county, such as Zong'ai and Jiechou, were also destroyed. In the hundred or so villages under the Yan bandit's \"integration of soldiers and farmers,\" most of the young and middle-aged people were forced into the army. After the Zhengtai Campaign, the Yan bandits created large areas of no-man's land, leaving vast areas of rural land barren. It is estimated that the county has more than 187,000 mu of wasteland, accounting for more than a quarter of the total land area. The grain harvested in the cultivated areas was also forcibly requisitioned and plundered by the Yan bandits, causing a serious disaster in Shouyang, which was known as a grain-producing area. According to partial statistics from six districts, the disaster victims who have nothing to eat currently account for an average of about 20% of the population in these six districts. During the Jinzhong Campaign, the entire territory of the county was liberated. The north and south Shouyang, which had been divided by the Yan bandits, announced their unification and merger on the seventh of last month. After investigation and understanding, our democratic government quickly carried out disaster relief and resumed and developed production. In terms of disaster relief, 200 shi of relief grain were distributed at the beginning of this month. On the 10th of this month, the county party committee organized a work group of 22 people, including office cadres, led by Zhang Cuisan, secretary of the county party committee, to organize mass production in the newly liberated disaster areas. In terms of production, they are actively preparing to eliminate wasteland, accumulate fertilizer, and plant wheat. It is planned that each person in the old and semi-old areas will plant 2.5 mu of wheat, and each person in the new area will plant 1 mu of wheat. The shortage of 1,759 shi of wheat seeds will be solved by the county for 520 shi, and the rest will be solved by mobilizing social mutual assistance. In order to stabilize the masses' production mood, it was also announced that the land reform will not be carried out in areas where the Yan bandit's \"integration of soldiers and farmers\" had been implemented, nor will rent and interest reduction be implemented, but land adjustment will be implemented, with a 30/70 split. At present, all districts are actively carrying out production recovery. The fifth district is making a concentrated effort to cut artemisia and compost fertilizer in preparation for planting wheat. In ten days, 28 villages in the district have cut more than 500,000 jin. The decision to eliminate wasteland is to have each able-bodied laborer reclaim 2 mu of wasteland and each livestock labor reclaim 5 mu of wasteland. In terms of industry and commerce, after the government conducted in-depth publicity on the war situation and explained industrial and commercial policies, it first adjusted the city's housing, deciding that the houses should be returned to their original owners. For some merchants' old stock of American and Chiang goods, free trade was allowed and no more taxes were levied, and loans of more than 3 million yuan were issued. Under this correct grasp of policies and practical support, the commerce in Shoucheng has developed from the more than 60 households restored when it was first liberated to 150 stores of all sizes in just over 20 days, with all kinds of daily necessities such as agricultural tools and printed cloth available, and the market is gradually prospering. Nine of the original eleven market towns have reopened. In Zong'ai town, the number of businesses has grown to 157 households, and the market is very crowded. Workshops have also begun to be built. In the industrial and mining industry, the bowl kiln in Duanwang town has been repaired and is shipping goods, and the coal kilns in the Huangdangou area have been put into operation one after another.\n　　　　　　\n　　　　\n          (Zhang Shanfu, Gao Chen, Tang Xijiang)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 寿阳全境解放后　农工商业都有了起色\n张善甫　高臣　唐希江\n1948-09-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　寿阳全境解放后\n  　农工商业都有了起色\n    【晋中讯】寿阳大部地区，久为日寇侵占，抗战胜利后，又被阎匪侵入，在其暴政统治下，工商业破坏殆尽，全县宗艾、解愁等十一个有名集镇，亦全被摧毁。在阎匪实行“兵农合一”下的百余村庄，青壮年大部被迫当兵。正太战役后，阎匪更制造了大片无人区，使广大农村土地荒芜。计全县生熟荒地十八万七千余亩，占土地总数四分之一以上。种耕的地区收下粮食，又为阎匪强征搜刮，使素称产粮区的寿阳，造下严重灾荒，据六个区部分统计，当下没吃的灾民平均占该六区人口百分之二十左右。晋中战役中，该县全境解放，为阎匪分割的南北寿阳，于上月七日宣布统一合并，我民主政府经过调查了解，迅即进行救，灾恢复发展生产。救灾方面，本月初发出救济粮二百石，县委于本月十日组织包括机关干部二十二人的工作组，由县委张崔三亲自领导到新解放灾区组织群众生产。生产方面，积极准备灭荒、积肥种麦，计划老区半老区每人种麦二亩半，新区每人种麦一亩，不足麦籽一七五九石，由县里解决五二○石，其余发动社会互济解决。为安定群众生产情绪，并宣布曾实行阎匪“兵农合一”地区不进行土改，也不实行减租减息，而实行调剂土地，三七分青。现各区都在积极进行恢复生产，五区正突击割蒿沤肥准备种麦，十天工夫，全区二十八村已割五十余万斤。灭荒决定每全劳力开荒二亩，畜力开荒五亩。工商业方面，经政府深入宣传战争形势，讲解工商业政策，首先调剂市房，决定房归原主，对有的商号旧存美蒋货物，允许自由贸易，不再征税，并发放贷款三百余万。在此正确的掌握政策及实际扶植下，寿城商业由刚解放时所恢复的六十余户，只经二十余天，即发展到大小商店一百五十余户，农具、花布等各色日用品俱全，市场逐渐繁荣。原十一个集镇九个已重新开集，宗艾镇商家发展到一五七户，市面非常拥挤，作坊也开始修建，工矿业段王镇碗窑已修复出货，黄丹沟一带煤窑已陆续开工。　　　　　　\n　　　　\n          （张善甫、高臣、唐希江）"

Except for a few areas that suffered from hail and drought disasters resulting in reduced yields, sorghum and millet generally have yields of 80% to 90% or more. In Ju County, out of fourteen districts, only two districts were reduced to 70% due to drought, another two districts yielded 100%, and the rest averaged around 80%. The total of over 400,000 mu of sorghum in the county increased by an average of one-third compared to last year. Rizhao, Zhuting (i.e., Ganyu), Donghai, and other counties, except for coastal areas and a few villages, generally yielded 80% or more in most areas. Zhennan, Chengguan, Zhumeng, Wushan, and other districts in Zhuting achieved a 100% bumper harvest. Due to the development of the increased production movement in the southern districts of Ju (County), calling for more hoeing and fertilization, the yields were particularly high. For example, in Sangzhuang District, Xu Xianrong's 1.2 mu (large mu) of millet in Heilongpo Village yielded 450 jin. He estimated, based on medium-sized millet ears, that each ear had 7,000 grains. Compared to the usual years of \"60 for wheat, 3,000 for millet,\" this year it has more than doubled. Linshu (New County, originally eastern Linyi), except for thirty-some villages in Cangshan and Yushan districts that suffered from hail, generally produced two-fifths more than last year.

    "content": "Cadres and Party Members Actively Lead:\n\tEarly Harvesting and Planting in Various Parts of Taiyue\n\n[Taiyue Electric] The autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign has begun in various parts of Taiyue. In Tunliu County, 150,000 mu of wheat will soon be sown. In Yangcheng County, 200,000 mu of the 210,000 mu of beans have already been harvested. In Nanma Village, Jicheng, wheat sowing was completed in eight days. In Tunliu, Qinyuan, Yangcheng, and Qinshui, leadership has been strengthened from top to bottom this time, and attention has been paid to overcoming laissez-faire attitudes. In Jincheng, district leaders convened meetings of village chiefs, heads of farmers' associations, labor heroes, and mutual aid team leaders to identify cadres with sentiments of waiting for or fearing Party rectification, as well as fears of land appropriation leading to reluctance to apply manure. The leadership immediately clarified the principles of Party rectification, explained the Administrative Office's autumn production instructions, and made it clear that land reform in our region had been basically completed, land rights had been largely determined, and people's minds had been initially stabilized. In Nanma Village, Third District of Jicheng, 800 mu of wheat typically took a month to sow, but this time, on one hand, ideological concerns were resolved, and on the other hand, the organization was good, and it was completed in eight days. Regarding organizational leadership, the methods adopted varied depending on the organizational situation in different regions. In villages with a foundation of mutual aid and labor exchange, cadres went deep into mutual aid teams and worked with the masses in the fields, leading from production. This was relatively successful in Gaoping: cadres and Party members took the lead, first completing the fertilizer accumulation plan, and then continued to lead the promotion of wheat planting and autumn harvesting. For example, in Pangcun, Xia Yujing, Zaili, and Longqu villages, Party member cadres took the lead in applying more fertilizer themselves during wheat planting, which promoted everyone to apply more fertilizer. Zaili Village applied 1,288 loads of Artemisia grass fertilizer and 656 cartloads of pond fertilizer to 64 mu of wheat land, and planted it in a timely manner. Leadership has also been strengthened in most areas of Tunliu, Yangcheng, and Qinshui. In areas where mutual aid teams have disbanded, cadres lead the rectification and restoration of mutual aid teams. Examples include Dongjiashan in Qinshui and Yangyi in Yangcheng, where the reasons for the disbandment of mutual aid teams were examined, and restoration or reorganization was carried out based on the principle of voluntary participation and equal value. In particular, further organization was carried out to involve women, children, and semi-laborers in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. In villages such as Zaili in Gaoping, women were organized to work in the fields, sharing the burden of autumn harvest and wheat planting, and stubble removal with men. Yan Zhixian, the Party branch secretary, and Shen Meirong, the women's association chairman, of Nanzhuang Village in Jincheng, first mobilized and organized four women to work in the fields, harvesting six mu of grain and one and a half mu of corn in three days, which influenced everyone to request participation in the organization. Gradually, a total of 151 women were organized. Even women with bound feet voluntarily went to the fields. Due to the strengthened leadership, first, the realization of the early harvest and early planting plan was guaranteed. The Administrative Office called for planting around the White Dew solar term, which can generally be achieved in various regions. In previous years, some people even planted seeds by the Autumn Equinox, but this year, some wheat seedlings have already emerged. Villages such as Nanma in Jicheng already have seedlings an inch high. This, on the one hand, guarantees an early harvest next spring, and on the other hand, can prevent wheat scab. Early harvesting of millet can prevent wind and rain damage, reducing losses. Second, the masses have begun to pay attention to seed selection. Xucun exchanged more than ten shi of good wheat seeds, and Donglu mixed seeds with oil. Third, some areas have achieved deep plowing and sufficient fertilizer application, such as Nanma, Ganquan, and Dongshoucheng in Jicheng, and Pangcun, Xia Yujing, Zaili, Pucun in Gaoping, and Yaozetou and Xucun in Tunliu, where each mu of land was fertilized with more than 30 loads, and most were plowed three times. According to the masses, this is unprecedented in the past decade. However, it was also discovered that in Xijia Village, Tunliu, due to the lack of correction of deviations, the masses had many concerns, and wheat planting was very perfunctory, with some plowing once, some plowing and sowing in one pass, and very little fertilizer applied, only three to five loads per mu. According to the rectification situation in the entire region, this may not be an isolated case, but rather representative of a small number of villages.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 干部党员积极带头　太岳各地早收早种\n\n1948-09-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　干部党员积极带头\n  　太岳各地早收早种\n    【太岳电】太岳各地已展开秋收种麦运动。屯留全县十五万亩麦子即将种完。阳城全县二十一万亩豆子已收二十万亩。冀城南马村八天就把麦种完。无论屯留、沁源、阳城、沁水，此次均由上而下的加强了领导，注意了克服放任自流。晋城各区分别召开了各村村长、农会主席、劳动英雄、互助组长会议，检查出干部有等待整党、害怕整党的情绪，也有怕抽地而不敢上粪的。领导上即具体说明整党方针，讲解行署秋季生产指示，明确指示我区土地改革已基本完成，地权已大体确定，初步安定了人心。冀城三区南马村有八百亩麦子，平常得一个月种完，这次一方面解决了思想顾虑，一方面组织力量好，八天就种完了。在组织领导上，因各地组织起来情况不同，采取的方法也不同。一种是互助变工有基础的村，干部深入互助组与群众一块到地劳动，从生产中来领导，这在高平比较成功：干部党员带头，首先完成了积肥计划，接着继续带头推动种麦秋收。如庞村、下玉井、宰李、龙渠各村党员干部在种麦中首先自己多上粪，推动了大家多上粪。宰李村六十四亩麦地就上了青蒿粪一千二百八十八担，上池粪六百五十六车，又及时种上。屯留、阳城、沁水等大部地区也加强了领导。另一种是互助组已经散伙的地区，干部领导整顿恢复互助组。如沁水董家山、阳城阳邑一类村子，检查了互助组散伙原因，又根据自愿等价原则恢复或重新组织。尤其是进一步的组织了妇女儿童全半劳力参加秋收种麦。高平宰李等村组织妇女上地，与男人分担收秋种麦、割谷盘茬。晋城南庄支部书记阎志先、妇会主席申美容，先动员组织了四个妇女上地，三天割谷六亩，玉子一亩半，影响大家也要求参加组织，逐渐发展，共组织起一百五十一个妇女。连小脚妇女也自动上了地。由于加强了领导，第一，保证了早收早种计划的实现。行署号召白露前后种上，大体各地都可做到。往年甚至到秋分还有人下种，今年有些麦苗现在已经出土。冀城南马等村已有寸把高。这一方面是明春保证了明年早收，另方面能防止黄黑疸病。谷子早收了可以防止风磨雨沤，减少收成。第二，群众已开始注意选种。许村调换了十多石好麦种，东鲁用油拌种子。第三，有些地区作到了犁深粪饱，如冀城南马、甘泉、东寿城、高平庞村、下玉井、宰李、朴村、屯留尧泽头、许村等村，每亩粪都上到三十担以上，大部犁了三遍。据群众反映，这是十年来所未有的。但也发现了屯留西贾村因没纠偏，群众存在很多顾虑，种麦非常潦草，有的犁了一遍，有的连犁带种一遍，上粪很少，每亩才上三、五担。根据全区纠偏情形，可能这不是个别的，而是代表一小部分村庄的。"

    "content": "Xinxian City is Revived!\n    Shu Ting\n    After being oppressed and exploited by the Japanese and Yan regime for twelve years, Xinxian City was recovered by our army on July 20th, and 230,000 people in the county were liberated. After our army entered the city, it strictly implemented our Party's correct policy for newly recovered cities. With the support of the people and the efforts of all comrades in the Party, government, army, and civilians, the market order stabilized after more than ten days of control, most of the industry and commerce resumed business, the \"soldier-peasant integration\" tyranny was abolished, and grain and seeds were loaned, wasteland was reclaimed, and the poor were aided, which won praise from the majority of citizens and people from all walks of life.\n    Our Army Enters the City with Strict Discipline\n    After our army entered the city, it was strictly disciplined and adhered to the strict discipline of not taking a single needle or thread from the people. Individual violations of city discipline occurred, such as the cavalry company confiscating a private hospital. After it was discovered, the unit was immediately ordered to return everything and compensate for the loss of 10 million yuan (currency of the Jin-Sui Peasant Bank). The company's instructor is preparing to punish them. Some people took away some personal items left by the enemy and puppet organs, and the city defense troops immediately stopped and corrected them. They were kind and amiable to the people. Those who were previously deceived by Yan's bandits and were afraid of our Party and our army now say: \"We have never seen such a good army.\"\n    Correct Implementation of Lenient Policy\n    After entering the city, the Public Security Bureau established police stations in various streets. In addition to issuing announcements, mass meetings were held in various districts to announce our Party's lenient policy. It was announced that as long as the puppet personnel registered and declared their residential address, they would be conditionally restored to freedom. As a result, within five days of liberation, more than 1,000 Yan bandit personnel came to register. They gratefully said of the lenient policy: no one was killed, few people were detained, and they felt that they had been fooled by Yan Xishan.\n    Citizens Help Me Search for Supplies\n    After I announced that the masses in Chengguan should hand over the enemy and puppet's hidden and abandoned military materials, the citizens enthusiastically helped me search, and they reported it themselves, searching for a lot of military weapons and other military supplies from basements, wells, fire pits, and toilets. According to preliminary statistics, more than 170,000 bullets alone were collected, and thousands of stones of grain.\n    Four Doors Open Wide · The Eighth Route Army Brings in Wealth\n    The democratic municipal government continued to employ most of the original street office personnel, except for a few who were most dissatisfied by the masses, and they worked under the leadership of the democratic government. In order to gradually restore the prosperity of the market and facilitate cultivation, the east and west gates, which had been closed by the enemy for several years, were opened for traffic. The citizens were extremely happy. An old man, Li Liansheng, said: \"The 'soldier-peasant integration' divided my land, and I had no choice but to set up a small stall. Later, I couldn't afford to donate money, so I had to work for others. A soldier from the 39th Division and his wife planted my land. This time the soldier and his wife left, and my land is back. I came in from the east gate and went out from the west gate, circling around. It's really 'four doors open wide, the Eighth Route Army brings in wealth.'\"\n    Explicitly Protect Industry and Commerce\n    There were originally sixteen lines of business in Xincheng, with more than 500 companies. Under the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies of Yan's bandits, many large businesses closed down, leaving only 266 stalls, pharmacies, and dim sum shops, and more than 130 small vendors. More than 70 shops and more than 200 small vendors were forcibly transferred outside the city by Yan's bandits. When the enemy fled, they looted the merchants, and some had already suspended business. As soon as our army entered the city, it explicitly ordered the protection of industry and commerce. After a few days of propaganda and contact, they were all willing to resume business quickly. We listened to the merchants' voices and agreed to move the market from outside the city back to the city, and divide the market in the city to restore the market. Now the merchants are returning one after another. What the merchants are particularly concerned about are the landlords and rich peasants in the countryside who have been classified as such, and they doubt whether we will liquidate them. After we explained the industrial and commercial policies, some people immediately expressed their willingness to increase capital. Most of them have resumed business within ten days of liberation. The daily transaction volume is about 100 million yuan. A butcher, Niu Bao, said: \"If the Eighth Route Army hadn't come, I would have run away. This time I can live. When Yan Xishan was in power, relatives were not relatives, and six people were not six people. As soon as the sun went down, the streets were like dead people. Now relatives can come, the streets are bustling and lively, the four doors are open, and people can come and go freely, and business can be done. It's really liberated.\" Under the care and custody of the workers, the electric light company generated electricity as usual on the second day after liberation.\n    Abolish the \"Soldier-Peasant Integration\" Tyranny\n    Under the tyranny of Yan's bandits' \"soldier-peasant integration,\" more than 90 hectares of land in Chengguan were abandoned, more than 2 hectares were occupied by enemy fortifications, and the output generally decreased by 30% to 40%. Merchants were also incorporated into the industrial and commercial groups, and three people had to provide a soldier. In addition to the business tax and the same heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies as the peasants, two people had to support one of Yan's soldiers, and each family had to pay at least four jiao of silver (equivalent to 20,000 yuan) in preferential treatment fees every day. Therefore, when our democratic government announced the abolition of the \"soldier-peasant integration\" tyranny and all heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies under the rule of Yan's bandits, the people were all overjoyed and happily said: \"This time we can live!\"\n    Lend Grain and Seeds to Rush to Plant Wasteland\n    In order to prevent the land from being abandoned and to facilitate rush planting, the democratic government decided that the abandoned land and summer stubble land should be cultivated by the original owners (landless people), and the green seedlings should still be cultivated and harvested by the original planters. Those who could not afford to cultivate could be adjusted, and after the autumn harvest, the rent would be reduced and the grain would be distributed. And allow the masses to adjust each other under fair and reasonable conditions. The masses happily said: \"The Eighth Route Army does things reasonably and fairly, everyone has land to plant, and they can live in the future.\" At the same time, seize the opportunity to lend out seeds. Mobilize the masses to rush to plant buckwheat and autumn vegetables, and announce that buckwheat and autumn vegetables are exempt from public grain. A total of 12 shi of buckwheat seeds and more than 10 shi of grain were lent to help poor citizens rush to plant. In the past, the white land around the city has now been transformed into a green field.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 忻县城复活了！\n舒挺\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　忻县城复活了！\n    舒挺\n    被日阎统治压榨了十二年的忻县城在七月二十日为我军收复后，全县二十三万人民获得了解放。我军进城后，严格执行了我党对新收复城市的正确政策，在人民拥护与党政军民全体同志的努力下，经十余日的管制，市面秩序安定，工商大半恢复营业，“兵农合一”暴政废除，贷粮贷种抢荒济贫，获得广大市民与各阶层人士的称赞。\n    我军入城纪律严明\n    我军进入城后，纪律严明，遵守不拿人民一针一线的严格纪律；有个别违犯城市纪律的，如骑兵连没收一家私人医院，发现后，即令该部将东西全部退回，并赔偿损失一千万元（晋绥农民银行钞票下同），该连指导员正拟处分中。有人拿走敌伪机关留下的一些私人用品，城防部队即马上制止、纠正。他们对人民和和气气。以前受阎匪骗而害怕一我党我军的，现在都说：“咱们没有见地这样好的部队”。\n    正确实行宽大政策\n    入城后，公安局成立各街派出所，除出布告外，分区召开群众大会，宣布我党宽大政策。宣布伪人员只要登记声明，注明居住地址，即有条件的恢复自由。这样，解放后五天内，来登记的阎匪人员即达千余人。他们对宽大政策感激说：没杀一人，扣人很少，感到是上了阎锡山的当。\n    市民帮我搜查物资\n    当我通告城关群众交出敌伪隐藏遗弃之军火器材后，市民即热烈帮助我搜查，纷纷自报，从地下室、水井、火坑、厕所中搜寻出不少军火武器及其他的军用品。据初步统计：只子弹一项即搜集十七万余发，粮食数千石。\n    四门大开·八路进财\n    民主市政府对原街公所人员，除个别为群众最不满者予以撤换外，大部人员继续留职，在民主政府领导下进行工作。为便于逐渐恢复市面繁荣，便利耕作，将敌人封闭数年的东、西二门拆开通行，市民异常高兴，一个老汉李连生说：“兵农合一把我的地分走了，没办法摆了一个小摊子，后来捐款捐的也干不起啦，只好给人家动弹，我的地叫三十九师的一个兵种着，这次那个兵和他老婆走了，我的地又回来了。我从东门进来从西门出去，绕了绕，真是‘四门大开，八路进财’。”\n    明令保护工商业\n    忻城商业原有十六行，共五百余家，在阎匪苛捐杂税下，很多大商号倒闭，只留下摊贩、药店、点心铺等二百六十六家，小担百三十余个。其中七十余家商号和二百余家小摊贩，被阎匪强制转移城外。敌人逃跑时，对商户实行抢劫，有的已暂停营业。我军一入城，即明令保护工商业，经几天的宣传与接近后，均愿迅速恢复营业。我们听取商家呼声，同意将市场由城外迁回城内，并在城内划分市场，恢复集市。现各商户正纷纷回迁。商人特别关心的是被划为地主富农的乡下财东，怀疑我们是否清算。当我们将工商业政策说清后，有人当场表示愿意增加资本。在解放后十天内已大半恢复营业。每日交易额约十万万元。一个屠夫牛保说：“八路不来，我就准备跑了，这一下可活出来了。阎锡山在时亲家没亲家，六人没六人，太阳一落，街上就象死下人了。现在亲家也能来了，街上烘烘火火，热热闹闹，四门大开，自由往来，买卖能作了，真是解放了。”电灯公司在工人爱护保管下，解放后第二日，即照常发电。\n    废除“兵农合一”暴政\n    在阎匪“兵农合一”暴政下，城关九十余顷土地，荒掉十余顷，敌工事占了两顷多，产量普遍降低百分之三十至四十。商人也被编在工商组内，三个人同样要出一个兵，两个人除出营业税和农民一样的苛捐杂税外，也要养活阎军一个，全家每天每人平均至少要出四角白洋的优待费（合洋二万元）。因而当我民主政府宣布废除阎匪统治下的“兵农合一”暴政与一切苛捐杂税后，人民无不额手相庆，高兴的说：“这下可活出来了！”\n    贷粮贷种抢种荒地\n    民主政府为了不荒地及便于抢种，决定已荒地及夏茬地归原主（失地人）耕种，青苗地仍由原种地人负责锄耧收割，无力耕种的可调剂，秋收后，按减租分粮。并允许群众在公平合理的条件下互相调剂，群众高兴的说：“八路军办事合情合理，人人都有地种，以后能活了。”同时抓紧机会贷发种籽。发动群众抢种荞麦、秋菜，并宣布荞麦、秋菜免征公粮。计贷荞麦种十二石，贷粮十余石，帮助贫苦市民抢种。过去城周围片片白地，现已变为绿色的原野。"

This year, clothing factories in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area have doubled their summer military uniform production compared to previous years with the same labor and production conditions, and have completed their tasks ahead of schedule. Their experience is: First, implement joint compilation and unified leadership of production. Clothing styles, sizes, and quality are uniformly regulated, saving a lot of manpower in decentralized operations and improving technology and efficiency. Second, establish and improve factory duty, technical inspection, and other systems, clearly stipulate the standards for recording work and merit, and factory rules, etc., strengthen the workers' sense of responsibility, and enable the leadership to understand the overall production situation in a timely manner. Third, the Party and the administration cooperate closely. Production tasks are discussed by the Party's小组 [small groups], plans are made, and the exemplary role of Party members is brought into play to promote the completion of all employees. The First Clothing Factory of the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region, which is rushing to make winter clothes for the People's Liberation Army, promotes mutual assistance and implements scientific division of labor, exceeding the production quantity every day. It is expected to complete the original plan three days earlier; the quality has also improved, with 99% meeting the standards, compared to only 94% in the past. The Liaobei Military Region Supply Department's Clothing Factory had scattered work and wasted a lot of manpower in the past due to unscientific grouping. Now, specific division of labor has been implemented, an inspection system has been established, and three more wadding factories have been added to cooperate with the work. East China's clothing factories have also made significant achievements in improving technology and saving materials. Zhang Yushan of the cutting department repeatedly studied the clothes four or five times before cutting. He cut 5,470 sets of military uniforms, saving more than 3,100 square meters of cloth, while still meeting all the standards for size and style. In the past, the carbon, machine needles, and machine oil used for ironing in the machine department were often insufficient. Workers combined broken carbon with water, dried it, and reused it. They also used hammers instead of stones to break carbon (to produce whole pieces more easily). After the whole factory adopted this method, it saved 3,880 catties of carbon in half a year. Due to careful responsibility, 69 catties of machine oil and 1,129 machine needles were saved in half a year.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥辽北华东等地被服工厂　改进了管理和技术　提高了产量和质量\n\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥辽北华东等地被服工厂\n  　改进了管理和技术\n  　提高了产量和质量\n    【新华社陕北二十日电】晋绥、东北、华东等地被服工厂改进管理，提高技术，提高了产量和质量。晋绥解放区各被服厂今年在同等劳力与生产条件下，夏季军服生产较往年增加一倍，且提前完成任务。其经验是：第一，实行合编，统一领导生产，服装式样、尺码、质量均有统一规定，节省了分散经营时的许多人工，提高了技术与效率。第二，建立和健全工厂中值日值班、技术检查等制度，明确规定记工立功和总结标准、厂规等，加强了工人的责任心，并使领导上能及时了解全盘生产情况。第三，党和行政密切配合，生产任务由党的小组进行讨论，订出计划，发扬党员模范带头作用，推动全体职工完成。正为解放军赶制冬装的东北军区军需部第一被服厂发扬互助，实行科学分工，每天超过生产数量，预讦可按原计划提早三天完成；质量也提高，合乎标准者占百分之九十九，而过去则只达到百分之九十四。辽北军区供给部被服厂过去分组不科学，以致工作散漫，人力浪费很大；现已实行具体分工，建立检查制度，并增设三个絮行厂配合工作。华东被服厂在改进技术节省材料上也有显著成绩。裁工部张玉山裁衣时反复研究四五遍才下剪，他裁军装五千四百七十套，节约布三千一百余方公尺，尺寸式样仍全合标准。机工部过去荡衣用的木炭、机针、机油常不够用，经工人把碎木炭用水合起晒干再用，又改用锤子代替石头砸木炭（易出整块）。全厂采用这办法后，半年中节约木炭三千八百八十斤。机针、机油亦因负责小心，半年内节约机油六十九斤，机针一千一百二十九支。"

Fenyang County originally had 106 salt houses (excluding the salt houses in the urban area), but under the massive extortion of the Yan bandit, almost all of them collapsed. The Yan bandit stipulated that regardless of the size of the pot, each salt house had to pay eight or nine *shi* of rice as \"tax\"; regardless of whether the soil could be used to boil saltpeter, each person in the salt house had to be forcibly levied 50 *jin* of gunpowder saltpeter every month. In addition, the Yan bandit often blackmailed salt farmers on the pretext of \"boiling saltpeter for the Eighth Route Army.\" Zhang Qifa of Dongmazhai was arrested for this reason and only escaped after handing over one *shi* of sorghum; Fan Yutang of Qingdui Village and two salt-boiling workers from Baijinbao in Dijia Community were beaten to death by the Yan bandit under this pretext. After the county was liberated, the democratic government posted notices to publicize our party's policy on industry and commerce, and abolished all the Yan bandit's harsh taxes and levies, and the salt and alkali industry was able to gradually recover. In the past month or so, seven salt pans, large and small, have been ignited, producing 2,600 *jin* of salt per day.

Furthermore, it is reported that the saltpeter industry in Yuci, which was strangled by the Yan bandit, is also gradually recovering with the support of the democratic government. During the Yan bandit's rule, it was stipulated that each saltpeter household had to hand in 600 *jin* of saltpeter per month, and the price given for each *jin* was not enough to buy two cigarettes. After liberation, the democratic government priced the saltpeter according to its quality, with a general price of no less than four *jin* of millet per *jin*, and in September, each saltpeter pot was given 5,000 *jin* of coal to solve the fuel difficulties of the saltpeter farmers.

    "content": "[Ji Zhong Electric] Jinan County (newly established county, formerly Tianjin County, Hebei Province, previously under the Bohai Liberated Area, assigned to Ji Zhong this August) has a vast salt field, producing a large amount of salt, and the local people depend on salt production for a living. Before liberation, the salt farmers suffered under the rule and oppression of the Kuomintang government, local feudal forces, and bandits, leading to a very difficult life. Before the incident [likely referring to the Communist takeover], the Kuomintang government seized the salt flats, prohibiting the masses from opening the flats for salt production. Some salt farmers who secretly produced a little salt would have their salt flats destroyed and be arrested if discovered by patrols, requiring bribes to be released. Some who boiled small amounts of salt would have their pots smashed if found. After the incident, local feudal landlords and despots became the owners of the salt flats, and the local people had to pay salt rent to the landlords every year, and selling salt had to be done secretly, otherwise they would be kidnapped by bandits. The local puppet self-defense corps even extorted in every possible way, requiring tax money for salt carts coming and going, deterring many people from transporting salt. Salt sales were sluggish, prices plummeted, and the masses were subjected to layers of exploitation, making their lives extremely difficult.\n\nWhen the People's Liberation Army reached Jinan, the salt farmers were liberated. The democratic government first called on the masses to open salt flats and produce salt in large quantities, explaining our Party's policies and taking responsibility for opening up sales channels for the salt farmers, announcing that if the salt produced could not be sold, the government would purchase it at market prices. Initially, the masses were concerned that the government would purchase the salt at low prices, but after repeated explanations from the government, the masses began to produce salt. Because they had been living in poverty for many years, they had no grain to eat and could not go to the salt flats, so the government provided grain loans to support them. In Qiu Zhuangzi, Da Su Zhuang, and other eight villages alone, 16,130 catties of grain were loaned. With the strong support of the government, the salt industry has greatly developed this year, the number of salt farmers has increased, and many new salt flats have been opened. For example, in Qiu Zhuangzi, the entire village had 60 salt farmers last year, producing 300,000 catties of salt. This year, the number of salt farmers has increased to 119, producing 1,000,000 catties of salt, and 49 new salt flats have been opened. Sun Sichang's family of five in this village, father and son, have been producing salt every year, but have been in debt every year, owing 40,000 catties of salt. After liberation, in just one year, he saved and repaid all his debts. This year, he produced another 50,000 catties of salt, which can be exchanged for 100 shi of corn (100 catties per shi), enough for the whole family to eat for five years. In the entire village of 280 households with 2,000 people, 260 households produce salt. This year, the most productive salt farmers (referring to the actual labor force producing salt) averaged more than 30,000 catties each, the average was 15,000 catties each, and the least was 10,000 catties. In total, the village produced 6,000,000 catties of salt. The entire village has now added 15 mules, 6 large carts, and 4 large boats, and is preparing to greatly expand salt transportation.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 津南盐业发展　盐民添购骡子大船\n\n1948-09-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　津南盐业发展\n  　盐民添购骡子大船\n    【冀中电】津南县（新划县，原为河北省天津县，前属渤海解放区，今年八月划归冀中）有一片广阔的盐场，产盐甚多，当地群众都依靠晒盐为生。该区在未解放前，盐民们受着国民党政府和当地封建势力以及土匪的统治欺压，生活很苦。事变前，国民党政府霸占盐滩，不许群众开滩晒盐，有的盐民偷着晒一点，被巡查出，先把盐滩毁坏，把人捕走，托人花钱才能出来。有的熬点小盐，查出还砸锅。事变后，当地封建地主和恶霸分子成了滩主，当地群众年年得给地主们拿盐租，卖盐时还得偷着，不然就会被土匪绑走。当地伪自卫团更百般勒索，拉盐的大车来往都要给税钱，闹的许多人不敢去拉盐。盐销路不畅，价钱跌落，且受层层剥削，群众生活极为困难。\n    解放军打到了津南，盐民解放了。民主政府首先号召群众大量开滩晒盐，讲明我党政策，并负责给盐民打开销路，宣布如果晒的盐卖不了，政府以市价收买。起初群众有顾虑，怕晒出盐来政府以低价收买，经政府再三解释，群众这才开始晒。因历年生活困难，早已没粮食吃了，不能下滩，政府便贷粮扶植。仅邱庄子、大苏庄等八村，即贷粮一万六千一百三十斤。在政府大力扶植下，今年盐业大大发展，盐民增加，并大量开设新滩。如邱庄子去年全村盐民六十人，产盐三十万斤。今年盐民增至一百一十九人，产盐一百万斤。并开设了四十九副新滩。本村孙思常五口人，爷俩年年晒盐，年年欠债，已欠下四万斤盐的帐。解放后才一年的工夫，他省吃俭用把帐都还了。今年又晒了五万斤盐，能换一百石棒子（每石一百斤），够全家五年吃的。全村二百八十户，二千口人，晒盐的有二百六十户，今年产盐最多的每人（指实际晒盐的劳动力）平均三万多斤，平常的每人平均一万五千斤，最少的也晒一万斤。总共全村产盐六百万斤。现全村已添了十五头骡子，六辆大车，四只大船，还准备大量开展运盐。"

    "content": "Lack of Seeds, Livestock, and Fertilizer\n　　Many Difficulties Faced by the Masses in Planting Wheat in Hebei, Shandong, Henan\n\n　　[Hebei, Shandong, Henan Dispatch] Currently, the autumn harvest on the south bank of the Yellow River is coming to an end, and people are plowing the land to prepare for wheat planting. Xinhua News Agency reporters visited twenty-one poor farmers in Qinliuzhuang in the second district and Dalizhuang in the sixth district of Chengwuxian County, which had undergone preliminary land reform. They reported that there are still many difficulties that cannot be resolved in this year's wheat planting. The most important are: (1) Everyone generally lacks wheat seeds. For example, Qinliuzhuang poor farmer Wang Xintian and his wife used to have more than two mu of land. During the land reform, they were allocated two mu. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits swept through in the spring of this year, all their grain was looted by the enemy. At that time, in addition to borrowing some grain, they harvested and ate a lot of wheat before it was ripe. After threshing the wheat, paying public grain and settling debts, they only had more than 30 jin left, and they finished eating it before the sorghum was ripe. Now he doesn't even have a single wheat seed. (2) Lack of livestock. Some used to have livestock, but after repeated seesaw battles and sweeps, they were robbed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. They said, \"We'll wait until those who have livestock have planted before we talk.\" Due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' looting, the problem of manpower, livestock, and seeds are all difficult problems for the masses in various counties of Henan this year. It is hoped that local governments will pay attention to solving them as soon as possible. Also: Correspondent Zhang Jiexu wrote that the masses in Liuguan Yan Village, Nanhe County, have great difficulties in planting wheat. Most of the masses want to plant wheat, but they don't have manure. Planting one mu of wheat yields one dou and twenty-eight sheng, which is not as good as planting sorghum next year. In the past, those who applied more manure could harvest seven or eight dou of wheat per mu; this year, the best wheat in the whole village only yielded two dou, and the land that was not fertilized yielded only nine sheng. The main reason is that too little fertilizer was applied. If three or forty jin of bean cake could be applied to one mu of land, then three to five dou of wheat could be harvested. In addition, there are more than 30 mu of wasteland in this village, which is sandy land. If wheat is planted and there is no hail, it will yield more than other land. It is not difficult to get one cloth bag of wheat per mu. However, because there are no wheat seeds, no one is planting this wasteland. Because if there is hail, the wheat seeds will be wasted. Zhang Jiexu suggested that the government should lend four or five dou of wheat seeds to plant this land. The leadership should find ways to lead the masses to solve the difficulties of fertilizer and wheat seeds.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 缺种子、缺畜力、缺肥料　冀鲁豫河南群众种麦中困难很多\n\n1948-09-25\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　缺种子、缺畜力、缺肥料\n  　冀鲁豫河南群众种麦中困难很多\n    【冀鲁豫电】目前黄河南岸秋收将要结束，正犁地，准备种麦。新华分社记者在城武县初步经过土改的二区秦刘庄、六区大李庄访问了二十一个贫农，他们反映，今年种麦仍有不少困难没法解决。最主要的是：（一）大家普遍的没有麦种。如秦刘庄贫农王新田老俩口，从前有二亩多地，土改中分了二亩，今年春天蒋匪扫荡时，所有的粮食全被敌人抢去，当时他除借了一部粮食外，麦子不熟就割来吃了很多；打麦后交公粮还帐，只剩了三十多斤，没等高粱熟就吃完了。现在他连一颗麦种也没有。（二）缺乏畜力。有的以前有牲口，经过屡次拉锯扫荡，被蒋匪抢去了。他们说：“等人家有牲口的种上后咱再说。”由于蒋匪的抢掠，河南各县群众在今年种麦上人畜力和种子都是困难问题，希各地政府及早注意解决。又：通讯员张阶顼来信说，南和县刘贯岩村群众种麦很困难。群众多数想种麦子，但没有粪，种麦子一亩，收斗二八升，不如明年种高粱。从前有的上粪多，一亩地有收七、八斗麦的；今年全村最好的麦子只收二斗，不上粪的地还有收九升的。主要是上的粪少。一亩地如能上三、四十斤豆饼，即能收麦子三斗至五斗。另外这村有三十多亩荒地，是沙河地，如种上麦子飙不打的话，比别的地收的还多，一亩弄一布袋麦子不难。可是没有麦种，谁也不种这荒地。因为如果飙打了，就搭了麦种。张阶顼提出意见，由政府贷四、五斗麦种，把这地种上。领导上应设法领导群众解决肥料及麦种困难。"

    "content": "Column: Voices from the Masses\n\n　　What Conditions Were Used to Classify Me as a Rich Peasant?\n　　Editor's Note: In the process of class determination, democracy should be fully promoted, allowing anyone (including landlords and rich peasants) to freely express different opinions, so that no one is wronged. After the three-round public discussion and finalization, if the person concerned still disagrees, they can appeal to the higher-level government. Based on this principle, if the situation described by Li Lulü is true, then the method of changing the class status in Xiyanxing Village deserves investigation. It is a mistake and a violation of policy for the work team to arbitrarily detain people during class determination. After Li Lulü came to our newspaper to complain, our newspaper has twice sent letters to the Ping Shan County Committee requesting investigation and handling and a reply. However, according to the situation Li Lulü described, the Ping Shan County Committee's handling of this issue is not serious enough. It is hoped that the Ping Shan County Committee will handle this issue in a timely manner before the distribution of floating wealth in the village, based on the spirit of the policy and the specific circumstances, and provide a public response.\n\nComrade Editor:\n　　I am from Xiyanxing Village, Second District, Ping Shan. Since I was a child, my family was poor and relied entirely on renting land from others to make a living. Through years of hard work, our life gradually improved. Around 1933, we started using a long-term hired laborer. At this time, my family had about forty mu of land (all dry land, only five or six mu of irrigated land), more than one mu of garden land, and rented seven mu of paddy fields. There were fourteen people in my family, and my eldest and second sons and I were the main labor force. My father ran a pharmacy (the annual income was not much, and because it was a family business, accounts were never settled annually, but it only supplemented some pocket money). He also delivered meals to the fields, threshed, and did some light work. The women all spun and wove, and also worked in the fields when they were free. This continued until 1935. In 1936, because the rented paddy fields were returned, we no longer used a long-term hired laborer. In 1937, we bought ten mu of paddy fields and hired another long-term laborer (this land was flooded in 1939). My eldest and second sons and I participated in the labor. Later, after the Japanese devils came, around 1938, our Eighth Route Army also arrived. My eldest son participated in work at the district level, and we still used a long-term laborer. My second son and I worked at home, and my third son, who was sixteen or seventeen years old, could also provide a person's worth of labor. At this time, my family still had about forty mu of land. But in August, the Japanese devils came and burned our house, and the long-term laborer left in less than a year. In the following eight or nine years, due to financial difficulties, we did not hire anyone again (not even short-term laborers). However, last year during the distribution, my family was classified as landlords and driven out of the house. In February of this year, only one courtyard gate was opened to allow us to return. This autumn, the work team came to re-determine class status and return things, and classified me as a rich peasant. I felt that the conditions were not met, so I went to the district with my eldest son to ask. The district committee said that whatever the classification is, it is, and they cannot wrong you. They wrote a letter to the work team. Later, Comrade Gao of the work team consulted with the district. My third son went to ask again, and the district said that it should be a rich household. Later, my eldest son went to ask again, and they still said that it should be a rich peasant and cannot be changed. Afterward, the village distributed some cooking utensils to the landlord and rich peasant households first, and what they gave me was all broken. My third son was a bit reckless and asked the work team, \"What is my class status? Why are you giving me these unusable things!\" The work team said it was a rich peasant. My third son took the September 3rd issue of the People's Daily and showed it to him, which contained the New China News Agency mailbox's answer regarding the standards for calculating the years and amount of exploitation of landlords and rich peasants, and asked him what conditions he was using to classify us. He didn't say anything and detained my third son. He was detained for three days before being released. Later, my fourth son (who is a teacher in Huolu) and I went to the newspaper office to ask what my class status should be. The newspaper office introduced us to the county committee for handling. The county committee calculated the amount of exploitation at 15%. My fourth son felt this was incorrect, so he went to the newspaper office again. The newspaper office wrote another letter to the county committee. This time, the county committee calculated it at 25%, but when calculating the total income, they only included agricultural income, saying that it exceeded 25%, and decided it was a rich peasant. However, my family also had income from the pharmacy, spinning and weaving, and raising pigs, none of which were included in the calculation. My fourth son said this was incorrect and asked the county committee to recalculate, but the county committee still said it was a rich peasant. I don't know what to do about this matter. My village is currently returning floating wealth to wrongly accused well-to-do middle peasants. I don't know if my class status meets the requirements for a rich peasant. What should be done with my confiscated floating wealth? I hope you can resolve this quickly.\n\n　　　　　Li Lulü, Xiyanxing Village, Second District, Ping Shan\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 订我富农是按啥条件？\n李禄禄\n1948-09-25\n第1版()\n专栏：群从呼声\n\n　　订我富农是按啥条件？\n    编者按：划成份中应该充分发扬民主，允许任何人（包括地主富农）自由发表不同意见，不叫一人受屈。三榜定案后，本人不服仍可向上级政府申诉。根据这一原则，如李禄禄所提情况真实，则西沿兴改定成份的办法值得检查。工作组划成份中随便扣人，更属违犯政策的错误作法。李禄禄来本报诉说后本报已两次函请平山县委检查处理并作答复。但根据李禄禄所谈情况，平山县委处理这问题是不够严肃认真的，希望平山县委对此问题根据政策精神，和具体情况在该村分浮财前及时处理，并作公开答复。编辑同志：\n    我是平山二区西沿兴村人，自小时家里穷苦，全靠租种人家的地过日子。全家长年辛苦劳动，光景才慢慢过好。到民国二十二年时开始用过一个长工，这时家里有四十来亩地（都是旱地，只有五六亩井浇地），一亩多园地，还租种了七亩稻地，家里大小十四口人，我和大儿二儿参加主要劳动，父亲开了个药铺（一年收入不多，因是自家生意，年年也不结帐，只是贴补个零花），也还上地送饭碾场做些轻活。妇女们都纺织，忙了也下地。这样到二十四年。二十五年因租的稻地退了，便不用长工了。二十六年买进了十亩稻地，又用了一个长工（这地二十八年被水冲了），家里是我和大儿二儿参加劳动。后来日本鬼子来后大概是二十七年吧，咱八路军也来了，我大儿参加区上工作，仍用了一个长工，我和二儿在家劳动，三儿已十六七岁，也能顶住一个人劳动，这时家里还是四十来亩地。但到八月间鬼子来烧了房子，不到一年长工就走了。以后这八九年因生活困难，没再用过人（短工也没用）。可是去年平分时把我家订成了地主，扫地出门，今年二月才开了一个院的门让回去。今年秋天工作组来改订成份退东西，又把我订成富农，我觉得条件不合，就和大儿一块到区上去问问，区委说该啥是啥，不能屈你。他给工作组写了信。后来工作组高同志到区上商量了，我三儿又去问，区上又说该是富家，后来我大儿子又去问，还是说该是富农，不能改啦。以后村里给地主富农户先分了些做饭家具，给我的都是破的，我三儿有些鲁张，就问工作组：“我是啥成份，为啥给我这些不能使的！”工作组说是富农，我三儿就拿了九月三号的人民日报给他看，上面有新华社信箱答的计算地主富农的剥削年限剥削分量的标准，问他是按的是啥条件？人家不说，就把我三儿扣起来了。一直扣了三天才放出来。后来我和四儿（在获鹿当教员）到报社问问，看我到底该是个啥成份，报社介绍我找县委处理，县委给算剥削分量是按百分之十五算的，我四儿觉得不对，后来又找报社，报社又给写信找县委，这次县委是给按百分之廿五算的，可是算总收入只算农业收入，说是超过百分之二十五，决定是富农，但我家还有药铺、纺织、养猪等项收入，均不给计算在内。我四儿说不对，请县委再算算，县委还说是富农。这事情不知到底该怎办？我村正在给错斗的富裕中农退浮财，不知我的成份到底够不够个富农？没收我的浮财该如何处理？希望能赶快给我解决一下。　　　　　平山二区西沿兴村李禄禄"

    "content": "(Taiyue Telegram) The Yuncheng Yanchi Bian Hexing Salt Field, after being supported by the democratic government and implementing a policy of benefiting both labor and capital, has completed its annual plan of producing six million catties of salt ahead of schedule. It is now revising its plan to increase production. Bian Hexing was originally one of the four major salt merchants in Yuncheng Yanchi, but for ten years, it was unable to sustain itself under the cruel plunder of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit gang. After liberation, it has been rapidly restored with the active support of a loan of 80 million yuan from the democratic municipal government. The number of employees has increased to more than 150, and more than 40 new houses have been built. At that time, a plan was made to produce 6 million catties of salt by the end of the year. Subsequently, the government announced the method of levying taxes on the field and implemented the policy of benefiting both labor and capital for the development of production. Shopkeeper Wang said: \"In the past, during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandits, salt taxes were very heavy, and the field merchants could not continue to operate, so they had to focus on the workers. This caused the workers to be uneasy about production, and the output decreased rapidly. Now the democratic government's salt tax is very low, and labor-capital relations have been improved, the system of beating and scolding has been abolished, wages have been appropriately increased, attention has been paid to the sanitation of workers' housing, attention has been paid to improving workers' diets, and workers' difficulties have also been appropriately resolved, which has brought into play the workers' enthusiasm for production, so the annual salt production plan can be completed four months ahead of schedule.\" This time, the method of joint discussion was adopted when formulating the new production plan. On August 23, Shopkeeper Wang convened a meeting of foremen and worker representatives to discuss future production increase plans. He first explained that \"Our annual salt production plan can be completed ahead of schedule, which is the result of the efforts of all employees. Now let's discuss how much more we can produce in the future and how to do it, and then make a plan.\" After discussion, according to the production capacity of all employees, a plan was first formulated to produce 60 mings, totaling 2.4 million catties, by the end of August.

    "content": "Changchun Stopped at \"Half Past Six\"\n    Interview with Dr. Zhang Dexin, Former Acting President of Changda University, Who Fled to Harbin\n    Wang Ping\n    This is a story told by Dr. Zhang Dexin, the acting president of National Changchun University who fled from the KMT controlled city:\n    In mid-October of last year, the People's Liberation Army attacked the Jilin-Changchun Railway, and the power supply at Xiaofengman was cut off. Changchun experienced a city-wide blackout at 6:30 PM on October 17th—trolleybuses stopped wherever they were, and machines froze in whatever position they were in. In that split second, the whole city lost its heat and light with a collective \"ah-ha.\" To this day, some trolleybuses are still parked on the streets, the machines remain poised for action, and the hands of electric clocks still point to half-past six.\n\n　　×　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　DepartTimeFromChangchun　　　×\n    Mr. Zhang Dexin disguised himself as a businessman and left Changchun on June 3rd this year, arriving in Jilin on June 17th. He only arrived in Harbin two days ago.\n    \"Ordinary people leave Changchun mostly for livelihood reasons,\" Mr. Zhang Dexin said. \"Sorghum rice has already been sold for 330,000 yuan (Northeast Circulation Notes in the KMT-controlled area) per kilogram, which is equivalent to 3.3 million yuan in inland KMT currency; each kilogram of sorghum rice contains about 30,000 grains, which means it takes 100 yuan of KMT currency to buy a single grain of sorghum. How can ordinary people survive?\" Mr. Zhang paused for a moment and said, \"But my departure from Changchun was entirely due to political distress.\"\n    I asked him what specific events caused him distress. He said:\n    \"Take the issue of Changda's relocation, for example. I never expressed a specific opinion, so the Kuomintang threatened me, saying that I was suspected of helping the Communist Party to control the youth. Originally, their logic was: those who advocate relocating the school are Communists, because this can maintain a part of the force to 'make trouble' in the rear, and, the relocation can be used to shake people's hearts; but those who do not advocate relocating the school are also Communists, because this can preserve the school equipment and most of the faculty and students, so that the Communist Party can take over when it enters Changchun. In fact, those who advocate relocating the school and those who oppose relocating the school are all Kuomintang members—the former are the Kuomintang members within the school, and the latter are the local Kuomintang members outside the school. This is truly a case of dogs fighting and biting someone, this is one. Second, the party members in the school (including faculty and students) interfere with school administration, making it impossible to carry out education. Some teachers are selfish and only care for their personal gain. For example, Wang Daogen, a professor at the Agricultural College and also the director of the Department of Agricultural Economics, was a cadre of the North China Puppet Regime's New People's Society before the recovery. He is now a key figure in the Northeast branch of the Youth Party. In early April, seeing that Changchun was 'in danger' and fearing capture, he sought an opportunity to flee, and demanded to borrow three months' salary in advance. When I refused, he actually wanted to resort to violence, so I immediately dismissed him. There were also four staff members who were openly gambling and were fired by me. There was a 'student' named Wu Yonggui who was actually a secret agent. He wore seven or eight gold rings on both hands and carried a pistol to class. Where did his money come from? Some students used the school's subsidized grain to make a fortune. For example, the school bought a large batch of sorghum rice at a price of 2,000 yuan per kilogram. When the price of rice rose to 8,000 yuan per kilogram, these special students used the student union or other names to force the school to sell it to them at the original price. After buying it, they hoarded it. When the price rose to 20,000 yuan per kilogram, they came to the school to negotiate, saying, 'The non-staple food allowance has not been issued yet (the non-staple food allowance from the KMT Ministry of Education is often delayed for a month or two), and the students are making a lot of noise. Let's sell the sorghum rice we have stored to the school as a non-staple food allowance!' With this transaction, they earned 18,000 yuan per kilogram. I discussed this matter with the director of the accounting office, and he said, 'Anyway, it's the same thing. If students sell it to outsiders, it's this price, and if the school buys it from outside, it's also this price.' Whether they colluded with each other to cheat, I don't know.\"\n    \"The most ridiculous thing is that after they saw that I was gone, they didn't move the reserved car for my use into the special office for the principal. They said I had a Communist style, and therefore firmly opposed my sitting in the car. In short, if we want to run the school in a good, upright, down-to-earth, and orderly manner, then you are considered to have 'ideological problems,' you are a Communist; the more chaotic, corrupt, and degenerate you are, the more 'ideologically correct' you are, and the more you are a loyal believer of the Kuomintang!\"\n\n　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×\n    We talked about Zheng Dongguo, the highest military commander of the Kuomintang in Changchun.\n    He is a person full of pessimism. Once, someone asked him what his opinion was on the relocation of Changda University. He smiled bitterly and said:\n    \"If I were the principal of Changda University, I would not advocate moving. If Changchun is lost, can Beiping still be defended? In China, no place is safe. To be safe, we can only move to the United States!\"\n    When the Kuomintang newspapers spread rumors, saying that the Shenyang \"National Army\" was \"attacking\" north and had already reached a certain place; or that the new army trained in Taiwan had arrived in the Northeast and landed in Huludao, Mr. Zhang Dexin asked Zheng Dongguo if there was such a thing. He kept shaking his head, waving his hands, and smiling bitterly.\n    Once, several news reporters asked him:\n    \"The Communist Party compares Changchun to a large prison. What do you think?\"\n    He answered quite bluntly:\n    \"That's right! I am the warden!\"\n    Now, this warden is preparing to become a prisoner, because land transportation has long been cut off. After the People's Liberation Army captured Dafangshen Airport in May, planes could no longer land, and all supplies and ammunition had to be dropped from the air. This is exactly in line with a common saying: \"There is no way to go to heaven, and no way to enter the earth.\" Let's see where this warden and his big and small jailers will flee.\n\n  　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n    We also talked about the lives and desires of the general people in Changchun, which are very simple: life is about surviving, and the desire is for liberation. The food situation was mentioned above, and the housing situation is also very desolate: many buildings have been demolished by the Kuomintang army, some buildings are not inhabited, so the upper floors are demolished; some are inhabited on one side and the other side is demolished. The wood that is torn down replaces coal and firewood. Some people collect wooden items to sell as firewood, selling them cheaper than firewood, the reason being that firewood is easier to split and ignite, while wooden items are difficult to split and ignite.\n    \"Merchants and people have heard about the industrial and commercial policies of the liberated areas, and they also know that Harbin and Jilin are becoming increasingly prosperous. They are hiding their goods, hoping to do business after liberation.\"\n    This reminds me of the story he told at the beginning: the trolleybus stopped in its original place waiting for electricity, the machine stopped in its original position waiting for electricity. As soon as the Eighth Route Army arrives, the electricity will arrive, the trolleybus will move, the machine will move, the goods will be taken out, and the market will recover.\n    Until Mr. Zhang left Changchun, the hands of the electric clock still pointed to half-past six, but people had already forgotten whether it was 6:30 PM or 6:30 AM—this \"half-past six\" has two meanings: from the Kuomintang's point of view, it is 6:30 PM, close to dusk, but when the people achieve their desire—liberation, it is 6:30 AM, and the sun has just come out.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　【Reprinted from Harbin \"Life News\"】\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长春停在“六点半钟”  逃到哈尔滨的前长大代理校长张德馨博士访问说\n王坪\n1948-09-25\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长春停在“六点半钟”\n    逃到哈尔滨的前长大代理校长张德馨博士访问说\n    王坪\n    这是国民党长春大学代理校长张德馨博士讲的一个故事：\n    去年十月中旬，解放军进攻吉长路，小丰满的电源被截断了，长春在十月十七日下午六点半钟全城停电——电车走到哪里便停在那里，机器转在什么姿势便停在什么姿势上。就在那一秒钟的时间里，全城一声“啊嗬”便失去了热力，失去了光明。直到今天，有的电车还停在街上，机器还保持着待动的姿势，电钟的时针还指着六点半。\n　　×　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n    张德馨先生是今年六月三号化装成商人离开长春的，六月十七日到了吉林，前两天才到哈尔滨。\n    “普通老百姓离开长春多是为了生活”，张德馨先生说：“高粱米已经卖到三十三万元（蒋管区东北流通券）一斤了，合关内蒋币三百三十万元；每斤高粱米约三万颗米粒，就是说：要一百元蒋币才能买到一颗高粱米粒，普通老百姓怎么活得下去呢？”张先生稍停顿一会说：“但我的离开长春，完全为了政治上的苦闷。”\n    我问他有哪些具体事情使他苦闷呢？他说：\n    “比方长大的迁校问题吧，我一直没有表示具体意见。国民党便恐吓我，说我有替共产党把握青年的嫌疑。原来，他们的逻辑是：主张迁校的人是共产党，因为这样可以保持一部分实力到后方‘捣乱’，而且，利用迁校可以动摇人心；但是，不主张迁校的人也是共产党，因为这可把学校器材与大部分教职员学生保留下来，以便共产党进长春时好接收。其实呢，主张迁校与反对迁校的都是国民党——前者是校内的国民党，后者是校外的地方的国民党。这真是狗打架把人咬一口，这是一。第二、校中的党团分子（有教职员、也有学生）干扰校政，无法进行教育。有的教员自私自利，比方农学院教授兼农业经济系主任王道根，光复前为华北敌伪新民会的干事，现为青年党东北要角，四月初旬看到长春‘危险’恐怕被俘、弄到机会想要飞走，强要预借三个月的薪金，被我拒绝，竟要动武，结果被我立即解聘，还有四个职员公开赌博，被我开除。有一个叫吴永贵的“学生”其实就是特务，他两只手上戴了七八只金戒指，腰里带着手枪去上课。他的钱哪儿来的呢？有些学生就利用学校的平价粮来发财，比方说，学校用二千元一斤的价钱买进了大批的高粱米，当米涨到八千元一斤时，这些特种学生便利用自治会或其他名义，硬要学校照原价卖给他们，他们买去后，便囤积起来，等涨到两万元一斤时，他们又来同学校交涉说：‘副食费还没有发下来（国民党教育部的副食费常常要拖一两个月才发下来的），同学们又吵又闹。我们把存的高粱米卖给学校作为副食费吧！’这样一倒动，他们便每斤赚了一万八千元。我为这事与会计室主任商量，他说：‘反正是一样，学生卖给外人，是这个价，学校从外面买，也是这样价钱。’其实他们是否狼狈为奸，通同作弊，我就不知道了。”\n    “最可笑的是他们见我走了，留用的小汽车，又不搬进校长特备的办公室里面，说我有八路作风，由于说坐汽车的原因，因此坚决反对我。总之我们要好正派的踏踏实实规规矩矩的办学校，你就是‘思想有问题’，你就是共产党；你越是乱七八糟，贪污腐化，那才是‘思想正确’，才是国民党的忠实信徒！”\n　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　×\n    我们谈到长春国民党最高军事负责人的郑洞国。\n    这是一个充满了悲观情绪的人，有一次有人问他对长大迁校有何意见。他苦笑着说：\n    “如果我是长大的校长，我是不主张搬的。长春丢了北平难道还能保吗？在中国，没一个地方是安全的，要保险，只有迁到美国去！”\n    当国民党的报纸大放谣言，说沈阳“国军”向北“进攻”，业已抵达某地；或者说：台湾训练的新军已开抵东北，已在葫芦岛登陆云云。张德馨先生去问郑洞国有没有这样的事，他不断地摇头，不断的摆手，还不断地苦笑。\n    有一次几个新闻记者问他：\n    “共产党把长春比成一个大监狱，你有什么意见？”\n    他回答得颇为干脆：\n    “对啦！我就是监狱长！”\n    如今，这位监狱长正准备当俘虏，因为陆上交通早已断绝，当解放军五月攻占大房身飞机场后，飞机也不能落地了，所有的给养弹药只好凭空抛下。这正符合一句俗语：“上天无路，入地无门”，看这位监狱长及其以下的大大小小的狱卒往何处逃命。\n  　×　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×\n    我们还谈到长春一般人民的生活与愿望，说起来也很简单：生活就是捱命，愿望就是解放。吃的情形上面提到了，住的情形也很凄凉：很多楼房被国民党军队拆了，有的楼不住着人，楼上便拆光；有的是这边住着人那边便拆光。拆下来的木料便代替了煤，代替了柴，有人收木器当劈柴卖，卖价比木柴便宜，理由是木柴易劈易着，木器则是难劈难着。\n    “商民听说了解放区的工商业政策，也知道哈尔滨、吉林正日趋繁荣，他们都把货物藏起来，希望解放后好做买卖。”\n    这使我想起他开头讲的那个故事：电车停在原来的地方等电，机器停在原来的姿势上等电，八路军一到，电就到了，电车也动了，机器也动了，货物也拿出来了，市面就复苏了。\n    直到张先生离开长春时，电钟的时针还指着六点半，但人们已经忘记了是下午六点半呢，还是上午六点半——这“六点半”是有两个意味的：在国民党方面说，是下午六点半，已经近黄昏的时候，但，人民一旦达到了他们的愿望——解放时，那便是上午六点半，太阳刚好出来了。\n  　　　　　　　　　【转载哈尔滨“生活报”】"

    "content": "【Taiyue News】The Kuomintang officers (with a small number from Zhang Lan Town in Jiexiu) who laid down their weapons in large numbers on the Linfen battlefield in May this year were concentrated in the Taiyue People's Liberation Army Officer Training Regiment for short-term education. Now, most of them have been released. They were moved by the truth and saw that the Kuomintang's rule was about to end. Therefore, they quickly realized that they had been deceived by the Kuomintang rulers in the past and were ready to become new people. For example, Li Zhenting, the regimental commander of the \"Tiger Regiment\" of the 72nd Division of the Yan Xishan army, was ill when he was first captured and brought to the regiment. We treated him as a friend and gave him good medical care. Soon, his illness improved, and he was very moved. He immediately called on the officers of the \"Tiger Regiment\" who had been captured with him to put down their ideological baggage, tell the truth to the People's Liberation Army, and provide detailed information about their true ranks, real names, and true histories. He also said with great indignation: \"Yan Xishan is a real traitor. I personally witnessed and participated in the Anping meeting with the Japanese invaders in 1943, and the collaboration between the 62nd Army and the Japanese invaders in southeastern Shanxi to jointly suppress the Eighth Route Army. There will be no good end to following him. I am over fifty years old this year and have been working for him all my life. In name, I am a regimental commander of the 'Tiger Regiment,' but in reality, I don't even have a horse to ride. The lame, brownish-yellow mule that I often ride was borrowed from a friend. I have decided to go home (to the liberated area) and do my best for the people.\" There are many such examples. Starting in mid-August, they were sent back to their places of origin. Those who have already been sent back include Wei Shaoren, a Kuomintang army major battalion commander of the 30th Brigade, Liu Yingjie, a major deputy battalion commander, Cai Shengxun, Li Zhenting, a colonel regimental commander of the \"Tiger Regiment\" of the Yan Xishan army's 72nd Division, Zhang Ru, a colonel deputy commander of the Jinan Garrison Area, and Guo Wei, a major press officer of the 66th Division, and other officers (with a small number of soldiers), totaling 963 people. Before their departure, they were given a rich farewell banquet and a warm send-off, provided with sufficient travel expenses, and all their stored belongings were returned to them. Many of them were moved to tears and expressed their heartfelt gratitude. For example, Chen Hanshou, a warrant officer of the 30th Brigade, said: \"I thought the watch you kept for me was broken long ago, but I didn't expect you to return it to me this time, and it still works well.\" Shi Guoquan, a soldier of the 27th Brigade, said: \"The money you kept for me was returned to me without even changing the numbers. It's really rare!\" In particular, Chen Yueqiao, a lieutenant deputy platoon leader of the 38th Division, and Yu Mingshan, a soldier of the First Army Headquarters, were both members of the Hui Muslim community. We took care of their Muslim lifestyle habits in their daily lives and allowed them to slaughter their own sheep and prepare their own food during the banquet. They were very grateful and said: \"We have never seen such care for us in the Kuomintang army for more than ten years. We will never forget the Communist Party.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 临汾战役被俘军官经过教育大部遣散\n\n1948-09-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　临汾战役被俘军官经过教育大部遣散\n    【太岳讯】今年五月在临汾战场大批放下武器的蒋阎军官（有一少部是介休张兰镇来的），集中太岳解放军官教导团短期教育后，现已大部遣散。他们受到真理的感召，看到蒋阎统治快要完蛋，因此很快觉悟到过去受了蒋阎统治者的欺骗教育，准备再作新人。例如阎军七十二师老虎团团长李震廷，初被解放来团时，身上有病，我方拿他当朋友看待，给他好好的疗养，不久他的病好了，他很感动，立即号召同时被解放的老虎团军官，放下思想包袱，对解放军说实话，把他们一伙十多个军官的真级职、真名姓、真历史，都详细说出来。他又很愤激的说：“阎锡山真是汉奸，三十二年和日寇在安平会议，六十二军在汾东勾结日寇共同扫荡八路军，这些事我都亲眼见过，也参加过。跟他搞有什么下场，象我今年有五十多岁，跟他干了一辈子，名义上是个老虎团长，实际连一匹乘马也没有，我经常骑的那茶色跛脚骡子，还是朋友借给我的。我决定要回家（解放区），为人民尽一点力。”这样例子是很多的，从八月中旬开始遣送他们各回原籍，计已遣送者，有蒋军三十旅少校营长魏绍仁、少校副营长刘英杰、蔡圣训，阎军七十二师老虎团上校团长李震廷、晋南团管区上校副司令张儒、六六师少校新闻干事郭伟等军官（有少数士兵）九百六十三名。临别时对他们举行了丰盛的会餐，与热烈的欢送，发给足够的路费，并归还每个人存放的财物。他们很多人都感动的流泪，说出衷心感激的话来，如三十旅准尉特务长陈汉收说：“你们替我保存的手表，我以为早坏了，想不到这次还给我，仍然走得好好的。”二十七旅士兵施国权说：“替我保存的票子，发还我连号码也没有掉换一下，真难得！”特别是卅八师中尉副连长陈月樵，第一军军部士兵余明山等都是回教教胞，日常照顾他们回教的生活习惯，会餐时让他们自己杀羊，自己弄来吃，他们很感激的说：“象这样照顾我们，在国民党部队干了十多年也没有见过一回，我们永远忘不了共产党。”"

In order to stabilize the countryside, develop production, and further improve the political and cultural level of the masses, winter studies should continue to be held this year. To this end, the following decisions are made: (1) This winter, from November 1st to the end of February next year, winter studies should generally be held in all consolidated areas. However, two different organizational forms can be adopted according to the different objects: For adult and elderly masses, the focus is on strengthening political education, without emphasizing cultural learning. The content should center on the two documents \"A Summary of the Two Years of the People's Liberation War and the Tasks for the Third Year\" and \"Take the Agricultural Production of the Liberated Areas a Step Further,\" with the addition of instructional materials from the Administrative Office and the District Party Committee regarding local work (especially production teaching materials). The District Party Committee will soon issue an outline as a reference for lectures. Primary school teachers should become the teachers of winter schools. Villages without primary schools can hire other teachers. In order to improve the understanding level of winter school teachers, counties and districts should conduct short-term or temporary instruction for winter school teachers. At the same time, it is encouraged that district cadres go to the countryside to give lectures for winter schools. In addition to participating in political classes, young men and women should be specially organized to conduct cultural learning, and literacy competitions can be launched among young people. Attention should be paid to turning cultural learning into a regular habit, that is, during busy farming seasons, it should be adhered to as much as possible without affecting production, so as not to forget what has been learned. In places where the New Democratic Youth League has been established, the Youth League should take organizing and leading youth learning as its regular and important task. (2) All localities should attach importance to the leadership of winter studies. The government's education departments, the Party's propaganda departments, and the farmers' associations, youth federations, and women's federations should jointly form a winter studies committee. The Party branch should take strengthening the political education of the masses and organizing the political and cultural learning of young people as one of its regular tasks; calling on Party members and cadres to play a model leading role in learning and become active members in winter studies. The progress of winter studies should be reported to the higher authorities regularly by all departments, and communications should be organized for publication in newspapers. (3) Government organs and schools should help and guide the villages where they are stationed to do a good job in winter studies. (4) All localities should immediately start to arrange and prepare, requiring that classes start on time and proceed according to plan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 准备开办冬学　北岳发出指示\n\n1948-09-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　准备开办冬学\n  　北岳发出指示\n    【北岳电】北岳行政公署和区党委发出举办冬学的指示，略称：我区土地改革工作已经完成，为了安定农村，发展生产，进一步提高群众的政治文化水平，今年的冬学，应该继续举办。为此，特作如下决定：（一）今年冬季从十一月一日至明年二月底，各巩固地区应一般的开办冬学，但可根据不同的对象采取两种不同的组织形式：对壮年老年群众主要是加强政治教育，不强调文化学习。内容以“人民解放战争两周年总结和第三年的任务”，“把解放区的农业生产提高一步”两个文件为中心，斟酌增加行署区党委关于当地工作之指示材料（特别是生产教材）。区党委即将编发提纲，作为宣讲的参考。小学教员应成为冬学的教员，无小学的村庄可另聘。为了提高冬学教员的认识水平，县区应进行冬学教员短期或临时传授。同时提倡区干部下乡为冬学讲课。青年男女除参加政治课外，应特别组织他们进行文化学习，并可在青年群众中展开识字的竞赛，应注意把文化学习变成一个经常的习惯，即在农忙期间也应在不影响生产下尽可能坚持下去，以免忘掉。已成立新民主主义青年团的地方，青年团应该把组织领导青年的学习作为自己经常和重要的任务。（二）各地应重视冬学的领导，由政府的教育部门、党的宣传部门，和农会、青联、妇联共同组成冬学委员会，党的支部应该把加强群众的政治教育，组织青年群众的政治文化学习，作为自己经常的任务之一；号召党员、干部在学习中起模范带头作用，成为冬学中的积极分子。冬学进行情况，各部门要向上级定期报告，并组织通讯在报纸上发表。（三）机关学校要帮助和领导驻在村庄搞好冬学。（四）各地应即着手布置和准备，要求准时开学，并按计划进行。"

Indian troops are encountering weak resistance from the Hyderabad army.\" Note: Hyderabad is one of the largest states in India, located in the south-central part of India, with an area of over 82,000 square miles and a population of over 16 million, making it the most densely populated state in India. Since 1946, there has been a strong peasant movement within Hyderabad, which has liberated over 2,000 villages with a population of five million from the old rule. The entire territory of Hyderabad is surrounded by Hindustan. Since India's partition last year, the Nehru government has insisted that Hyderabad join the Indian Federation, but this has been repeatedly rejected by the King of Hyderabad. Indian progressive newspapers point out that the attitude of the King of Hyderabad is mainly due to the support of British rulers and Pakistan. Due to the stalemate between the Indian and Hyderabad governments, traffic between Hyderabad and the outside world has been blocked by Indian troops in recent months. Prior to this war, the Indian government had demanded that the Hyderabad government disband the Muslim volunteer army \"Razakars\" and allow Indian troops to be stationed in Hyderabad, but both demands were rejected. On the 10th of this month, Nehru publicly declared that Indian troops would enter Hyderabad regardless of any resistance.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 22nd: TASS reports: Pravda recently published an article entitled \"Distorted Reflection Under the Guise of a Report,\" commenting on UN Secretary-General Lie's annual report on UN activities, which was released as the third UN General Assembly was scheduled to convene in Paris on the 21st. Pravda first pointed out: Amidst the increasingly sharp struggle between the world's democratic and anti-democratic camps, the UN has become a battleground for two kinds of foreign policy: the democratic forces, led by the Soviet Union, strive to strengthen international cooperation, peace, and democracy, thereby strengthening the UN organization; while the imperialist forces, led by the United States, are doing their utmost to pursue expansion and world hegemony, thereby undermining the principles and purposes of the UN. Unfortunately, however, Lie's report fails to correctly interpret events based on factual materials. In its general assessment of the situation, the report equates the two \"conflicting trends,\" creating the false impression that both tendencies are undermining the UN. Pravda then cited facts to show that Lie's report, in its sections on the principle of unanimity among the great powers, on Greece, Korea, Indonesia, Palestine, and the so-called \"Little Assembly,\" defends the U.S. and Britain's position of undermining the UN Charter and carrying out imperialist expansion. Pravda also stated: Lie's report allows for the possibility of submitting the German question to the UN General Assembly, but he knows that the formulation of a German peace treaty is solely within the purview of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Lie appears prepared to comply with the intentions of American politicians, who, because they cannot force their conditions to be accepted in the Council of Foreign Ministers on resolving the German question, have planned to \"appeal\" to the UN in order to achieve the goal of deceiving public opinion. The most prominent point of Lie's departure from the UN's principles and tasks is his praise of the \"Marshall Plan,\" which, it is already completely clear, will not only cause Western European countries to lose their economic independence but also their national sovereignty. Pravda concluded: This report reflects only the situation in the \"funhouse mirror\" of the U.S. and Britain, who are trying to turn the UN into a tool of their foreign policy.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 只不过是美英的“哈哈镜”　真理报评莱氏关于联合国活动周年报告\n\n1948-09-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　只不过是美英的“哈哈镜”\n  　真理报评莱氏关于联合国活动周年报告\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社讯：真理报顷以“在报告掩盖下的歪曲反映”为题，著文评论联合国秘书长莱氏在第三届联合国大会定于二十一日在巴黎举行之际所发表的联合国活动周年报告。真理报首先指出：在世界民主阵营与反民主阵营间斗争日益尖锐之下，联合国已变成两种外交政策斗争的场所：以苏联为首的民主力量力谋加强国际合作、和平与民主，从而加强联合国组织；而以美国为首的帝国主义势力，竭力追逐扩张和世界霸权，从而破坏联合国的原则和目的。但不幸的是，莱氏报告并未根据确实的材料来正确地解释事件。该报告在其一般形势估计中，把两种“互相冲突的趋势”等量齐观，造成两种倾向都是破坏联合国的错误印象。真理报继即列举事实，说明莱氏报告在大国一致原则，在关于希腊、朝鲜、印尼、巴勒斯坦、所谓“小型大会”各节中，为美英破坏联合国宪章及进行帝国主义扩张的立场辩护。真理报又称：莱氏报告允许德国问题可能提交联合国大会，但他知道：德国和约的制订，仅仅是外长会议的权限。莱氏似乎准备遵从美国政客的意图，他们因为在外长会议中解决德国问题不能强人接受他们的条件，已打算“上诉”联合国，以达到欺骗舆论的目的。莱氏背离联合国原则与任务最突出的一点，是他对“马歇尔计划”的称读，这个计划不仅将使西欧国家失去经济独立，而且失去国家主权，这已是完全明白的事情。真理报结语称：这个报告所反映的，只是美英“哈哈镜”中的情形，后者正力图把联合国变成他们外交政策的工具。"

    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Reader Correspondence\n\n　　How to Use Iron Machines with Handspun Yarn\n　　Answers to Readers' Questions from the Xingtai City Trade Union\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRegarding the development of the textile industry in our city from wooden machines to iron machines, here are the answers to the readers' questions, based on the information provided by Comrade Yan Jinyu, Chairman of the Third District Trade Union:\n\nThe first question: \"Are these iron machines with iron wheels or electric iron machines? Does the wide cloth woven from handspun yarn use foreign warp and handspun weft, or handspun warp and handspun weft? If the warp is handspun yarn, has it been processed? How is it processed and modified?\"\n\nThe iron machines in question are human-powered machines with iron wheels, not electric iron machines. The wide cloth made of handspun yarn is entirely made of handspun warp and weft. Before the [Sino-Japanese] Incident, there were iron wheel machines weaving wide floral cloth, but at that time, the yarn used was purely foreign yarn. During the enemy's [Japanese] occupation, cotton was monopolized, and all large and small textile industries were shut down. After liberation, the textile industry gradually recovered and developed with the support of the government, but at this time, we felt that the technology was low, and the quality of the products was poor, unattractive, and not durable. Therefore, it was often affected by foreign goods, and the masses did not welcome it. At this time, several experienced craftsmen began to study whether iron machines could weave handspun yarn. When they tried it, it kept breaking. Of course, the low quality of the yarn was a reason, but after investigation, it was found that the sizing was not good, and the yarn was not strong enough and easily became fuzzy, causing it to break. In the past, when using foreign yarn, only sizing the surface was enough, and after sizing, it only needed to be twisted once and dried. That would not work with handspun yarn. It must be processed and have materials added. Therefore, after research and experimentation, the solution is this: When sizing the yarn, in addition to using flour, some oil must also be added. The general experience is that one pound of oil is needed for twenty pounds of yarn (animal oil is better). First, mix the flour with water to make a thin paste, then melt the oil and mix it with the flour paste before applying it to the yarn. In summer, when the weather is humid and the yarn is soft, some glue must also be used (half a pound is enough for twenty pounds of yarn). Using the above-mentioned method of mixing animal oil, it will harden the yarn when used during sizing. In addition, after mixing the flour paste and oil together, apply the mixture to the yarn, knead it evenly, lift it out, twist it once on the sizing rod, and then twist it twice more when it is almost dry but not quite. At the same time, smooth it up and down several times with your hands, so that the flour paste is evenly distributed, and the yarn is shiny and strong. It must also be noted that handspun yarn is spun by women and does not have the uniform strength of foreign yarn. You have to twist it along the direction of the yarn, otherwise, if you twist it backwards, the yarn will become loose and weak, and it will easily break during weaving.\n\nThis experience solved the problem that had not been solved for a long time: the lack of strength of handspun yarn, the fuzziness and easy breakage when pulled on the machine. Therefore:\n\nThe second question, \"Handspun yarn does not have enough tensile strength to be used as warp for wide cloth, and there are still problems with using iron wheel wooden machines, and electric iron machines have even greater force.\" With this method, iron wheel machines can be used completely. However, electric motors have not been used yet and still need to be studied. Here, we cannot ignore the improvement in the quality of yarn due to the progress of women's spinning, which is also a decisive factor.\n\nThis experience is now widely adopted throughout the city. Wooden machines will all be replaced with iron machines. They are indeed more convenient and faster to use, and the quality of the cloth has been greatly improved, which is welcomed by the masses. This local product - floral striped wide cloth - has been sold to Ci County, Wu'an, and the Changzhi and Lu'an areas of Shanxi, and merchants are flocking to buy it. All factories are unable to meet the demand. The above can only be considered a bit of experience gained, and cannot be considered a major achievement. In the future, we are willing to work with workers and industrialists in the textile industry to conduct joint research.\n\n　　　　Xingtai City Trade Union, September 6th\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 土线怎样上铁机　邢市职工会答读者问\n\n1948-09-26\n第1版()\n专栏：编读往来\n\n　　土线怎样上铁机\n  　邢市职工会答读者问编辑同志：\n    关于本市纺织业由木机改用铁机这种发展上，读者询问的几个问题，根据三区工会主席阎金玉同志所谈分别答复如下：\n    第一个问题：“铁轮木还是电动铁机？土宽布用的是洋经土纬呢，还是土经土纬？如果经线是土线是否加过工？怎样加工改造的？”\n    所说铁机是铁轮的人力机，而非电动铁机。土宽布完全是土线经纬。原来事变前就有铁轮机织宽面花布，不过那时所用线子纯系洋线。在敌人统治时期，棉花被垄断，大小纺织业全被封门。解放后纺织业经政府扶植逐渐恢复发展，不过这时就感到技术低，出来的货身分坏，不好看不耐穿。因此常常受外货影响，群众也不欢迎。这时几个有经验的工师才着手研究铁机能否织土线？试用起来总好断，当然线子质量低是个原因，但考查结果，浆不好线子，线子劲小容易发毛也好断。过去使用洋纱，只面做浆而且浆出来拧一次晒干就行了，土线那样就不行。必须加工加材料，故经研究试验结果是这样：在浆线子时除去用面以外还须放一些油，一般经验是二十斤线需用油一斤（腥油较好）先将面用水和成稀糊糊，然后将油熔化开与面糊掺和起来就能下线。如果在夏天气候湿线劲软还须用些水胶（二十斤线有半斤就够）。如以上腥油掺和办法，浆线时一块用上起干硬作用，此外浆时把面糊连油一并闹好以后再将线子下浆揉匀，提出来拧一遍上浆杆，等快干而未干时再拧两次，同时用手上下多理顺几次，这样面糊走匀，线子又光又有劲。还须注意土线是妇女纺不比洋纱是一股劲，得顺线劲拧，否则拧倒了线，发松皮劲，织时容易断。\n    这方面得出经验就解决了好长时间所没有解决的土线没劲，上机一拉发毛容易断的问题，因此：\n    第二个问题，“土纱用作宽布经线拉力不够，使用铁轮木机尚有问题，电动铁机力更大”。这样话铁轮机完全可以使用的，唯电动机未曾用过尚须研究。这里不能忽视妇女纺织进步线子质量提高，也是一决定原因。\n    这种经验现全市普遍采用，木机将全部换为铁机，在使用上确灵便而快，布的质量已大大提高，得到广大群众欢迎，此路货——花条宽面布已推销到磁县、武安及山西长治、潞安一带，各商贩纷纷前来争购，各厂皆是供不应求。以上这只能算是一点经验之获得，不能算是什么大的成就，今后愿与纺织业行的工人，工业家共同研究。  　　　　邢台市职工会九月六日"

    "title": "Work Situation and Problems in Various Parts of Taihang: Comprehensive Report from Taihang",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-26",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Taihang Comprehensive Report\n\n　　【Taihang News】Since the August meeting of the District Party Committee, from the 15th to the end of the month, all regions have successively convened county party committee expanded meetings and joint meetings of district and village cadres. Some had as few as two or three hundred people per session (Lincheng), others had over a thousand (Linxian), and generally around six or seven hundred (Cixian, Wu'an, Xingtai). The duration was about seven to ten days. Leaders of each county concentrated their efforts and attached great importance to this work. Judging from the meetings and training in various places, it has played a significant role in clarifying the thinking of cadres and changing their sentiments, laying a solid foundation for ending land reform and launching production campaigns. The situation and problems in various places are summarized and reported as follows:\n\n　　Must Pay Attention to Season\n  　Specifically Arrange Work\n\n    I. Attention to the production season and specific work arrangements. According to the deployments of various counties, some county and district cadres have only over eighty people, yet they plan to complete land reform in more than 130 villages before autumn; some counties mainly focus on completing land reform and incidentally take care of production work; others divide the completion of land reform and the leadership of production into two parts, sending nearly two-thirds of the county and district cadres to lead one-quarter of the villages in the county to complete land reform. In short, the leadership of current production work in various places is not given enough attention. Now the busy season of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat sowing has begun. If this issue is not addressed well, the leadership will inevitably become detached from the masses and cadres. For example, village cadres in Wu乡 (Wu Xiang) County are unwilling to attend training in the county for fear of delaying wheat sowing. Some grassroots villages in 涉县 (She Xian) County are asking us to finish up quickly. Therefore, the leadership must pay attention to the busy farming season, cater to the demands of cadres and the masses, and clarify that the purpose of ending land reform is precisely to develop production. If production leadership is affected by the completion of land reform, the result will inevitably be that both land reform and production will fail. Some cadres believe that production work does not need leadership and that the masses will harvest and sow wheat on their own. This kind of laissez-faire attitude is harmful to the entire mass production movement. Therefore, currently, all localities, regardless of training work and ending land reform, must consider whether it affects mass production and violates the current demands of the masses. In today's busy farming season, for villages that are in the process of ending land reform, it is not necessary to force its completion. It should be appropriately brought to a close and shifted to production. Training work should also be considered in light of specific circumstances, utilizing seasonal gaps. Once the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and wheat sowing are completed, the leadership focus should be quickly shifted to ending land reform and rectifying the Party, while also organizing the masses for winter production.\n\n    Carry out Criticism and Self-Criticism\n  　Solve Cadre Thinking and Improve Awareness\n\n    II. Correctly assess the thinking and sentiments of district and village cadres, and attach importance to solving cadre thinking. Because regardless of ending land reform or leading production, it all depends on the district and village cadres. If the ideological baggage currently present cannot be removed, it will be difficult to carry out work responsibly. According to reports from various places, after the District Party Committee's May meeting, the thinking of cadres at the district level and above was generally clarified, but the thinking of the vast majority of village cadres and party members was not better resolved (in fact, it was latent due to the cessation of Party rectification). They have many dissatisfactions and opinions regarding Party rectification and correction of deviations. Therefore, training district and village cadres should not only be understood from the perspective of simply ending land reform, but should be regarded as a central link in the entire work. In solving this problem, the approach taken by the county party committees of Xingtai and Zanhuang is to let district and village cadres express their opinions as much as possible, even if it is grumbling. The main thing is to raise opinions on the leadership, and then the county party committee makes a deep and sincere self-criticism, admits mistakes, and shares responsibilities; at the same time, it guides cadres to conduct self-criticism. As a result, Zanhuang cadres said: Credit for credit, fault for fault, so there is no objection. Morale is very high. Although some counties (such as Wu'an) have attached importance to solving ideological problems, they have adopted a \"kowtowing\" policy without allowing cadres to conduct self-criticism, so the result is not very good. Some counties (such as Shexian) dare not boldly let cadres fully expose their thinking, but only criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of the past work and leadership from top to bottom based on the spirit of the August meeting, in order to solve cadre thinking, and the result is also not very good. Some counties believe that ideological problems have been largely resolved and that the main thing is to solve policy and work method problems. In fact, because the ideological problems of cadres have not been well resolved, policy and work methods cannot be resolved well either. Comprehensive experience from various counties shows that the key to solving the ideological problems of cadres is to first carry out heated criticism and self-criticism among the cadres, and the leadership must dare to make deep and sincere self-criticism. Only in this way can cadres be guided to conduct self-criticism, completely solve problems, and improve awareness.\n\n  　Implement the Entire Spirit of the Meeting\n  　Prevent Blindness and One-Sidedness\n\n    III. It is necessary to fully implement the entire spirit of the meeting, freely review history, thoroughly clarify thinking, and enable cadres to fully and systematically understand policies and practices, how this stage of work connects with the next stage of work, and how major work combines with minor work. Otherwise, blindness and passivity will arise in actual work. After the August meeting, the methods used by various counties to implement the spirit of the resolution varied greatly: some counties only conveyed and discussed the policies and practices for ending land reform, without discussing other parts, or even conveying them, completely dividing the work into two stages; some counties conveyed everything but only conducted a more detailed study of ending land reform, only emphasizing the steps and procedures, and only gave a cursory discussion of other parts; some counties conveyed everything from the August meeting but did not specifically discuss anything in conjunction with local conditions. Due to the above circumstances, cadres' thinking has not been fully and clearly resolved. Therefore, in actual work, it has been revealed that either they are not daring enough, or they have a simple task completion mentality, or they mechanically apply the spirit conveyed from above. In order to thoroughly solve the cadre's policy thinking and work methods, the August meeting should be fully conveyed. For ease of acceptance, it can be conveyed in stages, combined with historical review, and discussed in detail. After all the problems are clarified, the work that should be carried out at present should be studied in detail.\n\n  　How to Solve the Problem of Branch Leadership\n\n    IV. How to solve the problem of branch leadership. According to the book talk of Anyang County, the key to completing the end of land reform through the masses is the leadership of the branch. When the cadres of Shahe Village finished their training, they reflected: the policies are all right, but the village cannot hold meetings. When the cadres of Cixian County finished their training, they proposed: Our thinking is clear, it's easy to handle, but we are afraid that people won't listen when we go back, and we ask the leadership to solve this difficulty for them. All this shows that solving the ideological problems of cadres does not mean that all problems in the work have been solved. Since last winter, rural order has been chaotic, the masses are extremely democratic, the old style of work of village cadres and party members has been overturned, and a new style of work has not been established, so the branch cannot play its role. If this problem is not well resolved, the leadership of branch party members in the work will either be unable to start and will let things go, or will be forced to order them to complete tasks, and the old style of work will be revived. According to the initial training reflections from various places, this problem has not been specifically and clearly resolved. Therefore, the basic-level villages in various places that are ending land reform are still relatively chaotic: some branches are still taking care of everything, arranging the election of representatives, and actually appointing the chairman and vice-chairman of the people's congress; some are blindly convening mass meetings to elect representatives; and some cannot even hold meetings. How to solve this problem? We believe that we must first help the branch overcome the obstacles created by the previous stage of work to the current work: such as extreme democracy and sectarian struggles (the so-called sectarian struggle does not necessarily have a fixed organization). This requires a preliminary and appropriate adjustment of the relationship between the branch and the masses (especially with the poor peasant leagues), and if necessary, a preliminary adjustment of cadres, supporting and uniting upright and active elements inside and outside the Party, exposing a few troublemakers, stipulating some necessary systems and covenants in the village, and overcoming the state of anarchy. Secondly, and more importantly, it is necessary to preliminarily establish a new style of work for party members and village cadres, which is neither coercive nor tailism; neither ruling the masses nor being extremely democratic. This is a difficult problem and cannot be solved in a short time; but we must make the greatest and best efforts in this direction. First of all, we must solve the problem of how to lead the temporary people's congress, the peasants' association, and the village government, and solve the relationship between the Party and these organizations. The Party's leadership over all rural organizations relies on political leadership, and through its own party members, the Party's propositions and policies are accepted by the people's congress. In addition, the village people's congress and the village government cannot violate the resolutions and orders of the higher-level people's congress and the higher-level government; violating these is extreme democracy. They have the power to force troublemakers who violate government laws and the resolutions of the people's congress to obey. These issues are still unfamiliar in rural areas and should be given special attention.\n\n　　　　(Taihang District Party Committee Office)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行各地工作情况和问题　太行综合报导\n\n1948-09-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行各地工作情况和问题\n  　太行综合报导\n    【太行讯】区党委八月会议后，从十五日到月底，各地都先后召开了县委扩大会，区村干部联席会。少者每期二三百人（临城），多者逾千（林县），一般都在六、七百人左右（磁县、武安、邢台）。时间七天至十天左右。各县领导都集中精力，十分重视这一工作。从各地会议和训练情况看，在澄清干部思想、转变干部情绪上起了很大作用，为结束土改、开展生产运动奠定了稳固的基础。兹综合各地情况与问题报道如次：\n　　必须注意季节\n  　具体安排工作\n    一、重视生产季节与具体工作安排问题。据各县布置，有的县区干部仅八十多人，秋前要结束土改的即预定一百三十多村；有的县是主要搞结束土改，附带把生产工作照顾一下：有的县则是把结束土改与领导生产分为两部分，把将近三分之二县区干部去领导全县四分之一的村庄进行结束土改。总之，各地对目前生产工作的领导是不够重视的。现在秋收秋耕种麦的紧张季节已经开始，若不很好注意这一问题，领导势必脱离群众，脱离干部。如武乡县的村干部因怕误种麦，不愿到县受训。涉县某些基点村群众要求我们快点结束一下。因而领导上必须注意农忙季节，顺应干部和群众的要求，明确结束土改的目的正是为了发展生产。如因结束土改而影响生产领导，结果必然是土改也结束不好，生产也搞不好，两败惧伤。有些干部认为生产工作不用领导，群众自己会秋收种麦，这种自流主义是对整个群众生产运动有害的。所以目前各地不管训练工作与结束土改，都必须考虑是否影响群众生产，违背当前群众要求。在今天农忙季节已经来临，正进行着结束土改的村庄，不一定勉强完成，应适时告一段落，转向生产。训练工作也应斟酌具体情况，利用季节空隙进行。一俟秋收秋耕种麦之后，即把领导重点迅速转向结束土改与整党，同时组织群众的冬季生产。\n    开展批评与自我批评\n  　解决干部思想提高觉悟\n    二、正确估计区村干部思想情绪，重视解决干部思想。因为不管结束土改与领导生产，都靠区村干部去作。若目前存在的思想包袱解除不了，则很难认真负责进行工作。据各地反映，区党委五月会议后，大体是澄清了区级以上干部思想，广大的村干部党员思想并未达到较好的解决（实际是由于停止了整党而潜伏下去了）。他们对整党纠偏都有很多不满和意见。因此训练区村干部不能只从单纯结束土改来了解，而应视为整个工作中的中心环节。在解决这一问题上，邢台、赞皇等县委的作法，是让区村干部尽情的发表意见，即使是牢骚也不阻止。主要是提出对领导的意见，然后县委深刻诚恳的作自我检讨，承认错误，分担责任；同时引导干部进行自我检讨。结果，赞皇干部说：功归功，过归过，这样就没意见了。情绪很高。有些县（如武安）虽曾重视思想解决，但采取了“磕头”政策，没有让干部进行自我检讨，结果不很好。有些县（如涉县）不敢大胆让干部尽情暴露思想，只根据八月会议的精神，自上而下的批判过去工作上领导上缺点和错误，以解决干部思想，结果也不很好。有些县认为思想问题已大体解决，主要是解决政策作法问题，实际因为干部思想问题没有很好解决，所以政策作法也解决不好。综合各县经验，解决干部思想问题的关键，首先应该是在干部中间展开热烈的批评与自我批评，领导上要敢于深刻诚恳的自我检讨。只有如此，才能够引导干部进行自我检讨，彻底解决问题，提高觉悟。\n  　贯彻会议全部精神\n  　防止盲目性片面性\n    三、必须完整的贯彻会议全部精神，放手检讨历史，彻底澄清思想，使干部完整的系统的了解政策与作法，这一段工作与下一段工作如何衔接，主要工作与次要工作如何结合。否则在实际工作中就要产生盲目性与被动性。八月会议后，各县贯彻决议精神的方法极不一致：有些县只传达讨论结束土改政策作法，对其他部分未加讨论，甚至没有传达，截然把工作分为两段；有些县则虽全部传达，但只对结束土改作了较详细研究，只强调了作法步骤，对其他部分则了草讨论；有些县则把八月会议样样传达，样样未结合本地情况具体讨论。由于以上各种情况，干部思想就未能达到完整明确的解决。所以在实际工作中就暴露了不是不大胆，就是单纯完成任务观点，或机械运用上边传达的精神。为彻底解决干部政策思想与作法，应全部的传达八月会议。为易于接受起见，可采取分段传达，结合历史检讨，详细讨论。在全部问题闹清后，再把当前应进行的工作详细研究一下。\n  　如何解决支部领导问题\n    四、如何解决支部领导问题。按安阳县书谈，怎么通过群众完成结束土改，关键是支部领导。沙河村干部在受训毕时反映：政策都对，就是村里开不成会。磁县村干部在受训结束时提出：我们思想通了，好办，就怕回去人家不听，要求领导上给他们解决这一困难。这些都说明：解决干部政策思想问题后，并不等于就解决了工作中的所有问题。自去年冬季以来，农村秩序混乱，群众极端民主，村干部与党员旧作风反下去了，新作风未树立起来，支部发挥不了作用。不很好解决这一问题，支部党员对工作的领导不是无法入手，任其自流下去，就是为完成任务而强迫命令，老作风复活。根据各地初期训练的反映，对这一问题都未具体明确的解决。所以最近各地结束土改基点村仍都比较混乱：有的是支部在照旧包办代替，布置选举代表，实际是指定人代会主席、副主席；有的是盲目的召开群众大会选举代表；有的则是连会也开不成。如何解决这问题呢？我们认为必须首先帮助支部克服前段工作给当前工作造成的阻碍：如极端民主与宗派斗争（所谓宗派斗争，不一定有定型的组织）。这就需要初步适当的调整支部与群众关系（特别是与贫农团），必要时可以初步调整一下干部，扶持与团结党内外正派积极的分子，揭露少数捣乱分子，规定村中一些必要的制度与公约，克服无政府状态。其次，更重要的要初步树立党员村干的新作风，既不强迫命令，也不尾巴主义；既不是统治群众，也不极端民主。这是一个困难问题，不是一时可以解决的；但必须向这个方向作最大最善的努力。首先要解决如何领导临时人代会、农会及村政府的问题，解决党与这些组织的关系问题。支部对农村一切组织的领导，是靠政治领导，已通过自己的党员，把党的主张政策为人代会所接收。另外，村人代会与村政府对上级人代会和上级政府的决议命令，是不能够违反的；违反这些便是极端民主。对于违反政府法令和人代会决议的捣乱分子，有权力强制其服从。这些问题在农村说来还是生疏的，应特别注意。　　　　（太行区党委办公室）"

    "content": "【Taihang News】 Since the expanded cadre meeting in She County on the 24th of last month, village cadres have returned and conducted policy propaganda and education, which has boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses. According to reports received by the office from the first, second, fifth, seventh, and eighth districts, most villages have launched a manure accumulation and production increase campaign in the past ten days, and have formulated specific plans for expanding wheat field preparation for intercropping wheat, and are starting to reorganize cooperatives. The process has proven that breaking down ideological barriers is the key to promoting wheat planting and manure accumulation. For example, in Xiaoche Village in the fifth district, when the production committee mobilized the masses to accumulate manure, poor peasant Li Jinyuan said: \"Accumulate manure! The fruits of the distribution might have to be returned to others, let's wait and see!\" The leadership then carried out propaganda to end land reform and production policies. Middle peasant Li Shigong also clarified that earning a living through labor will not change, and there will be no absolute equal distribution, and said he was still planning to buy another mu of good land. After policy propaganda, the whole village cut artemisia and accumulated 7,500 loads of manure in three days. In Dongyu Village in the eighth district, after policy propaganda, the whole village first collected 13,000 jin of firewood for the families of soldiers, striving to expand wheat fields to more than 50%. Shentou and Linghou accumulated 40,000 dan of manure in five days after policy propaganda. The seventh district convened a district-wide village cadre meeting to explain policies, and everyone was in high spirits, and they formulated manure accumulation and wheat planting plans. The district also formulated a district-wide plan based on the specific wheat planting plans of each village. Dry land wheat planting in the district accounts for about 66% of the total dry land area, and paddy field wheat planting accounts for 80% of the paddy field area. We also strive to plant wheat in the garden land. We strive to apply 25 to 30 dan of fertilizer to dry and paddy fields. Conversely, in places where policy propaganda is not good or has not been carried out, the masses' thinking is confused, and production enthusiasm is not high. For example, in the Xishu base point in the third district, the masses are not thorough about the policies. When the leadership proposed expanding wheat fields and accumulating manure, the masses were not very enthusiastic, and only said that there were many late crops and intercropping wheat was not possible.\n\n　　When Linghou discussed the lack of fertilizer for intercropping wheat, the old man Sun Shixiang said: \"Last year, I intercropped wheat by rubbing the wheat seeds with oil. One jin of oil is enough for one dou of wheat seeds. Intercropping provides top and base fertilizer.\" When Nan Village in the first district was brewing and discussing intercropping wheat, some people proposed that it should still be called intercropping wheat, but we suffered losses from intercropping last year, and it is better to have one crop a year. Wang Jinshui said: \"The wheat of Wang Shouhun in our village matured early last year, and this year's wheat yielded five dou per mu, mainly because you intercropped it late.\" Everyone agreed with this opinion, and after discussion, the whole village will plant 75% of the dry land.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 宣传政策打破思想障碍　涉县开展积肥串麦\n\n1948-09-26\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　宣传政策打破思想障碍\n  　涉县开展积肥串麦\n    【太行讯】涉县在上月二十四日扩大干部会议后，各村干部回去都作了政策的宣传教育，群众的生产情绪提高。据办公室接到一、二、五、七、八区的汇报来看，十日来绝大部分村是开展了积肥增产运动，及扩大麦田准备串种麦的具体计划，并着手整理合作社。在进行中证明打破思想障碍，是推动种麦积肥的关键。如五区小车在生产委员会动员群众积肥时，贫农李金元说：“积肥哩！分的果实地不定还给人家退回哩，等等再说吧！”领导上就进行宣传结束土改和生产政策。中农李世功也明确了劳动起家不动，不是绝对平分，他说我还准备再买一亩好地。经宣传政策后，全村三天割蒿积肥七千五百驮。八区东宇庄在宣传政策后，首先全村给抗属打柴一万三千斤，争取扩大麦田到百分之五十以上。神头、岭后，经过宣传政策，五天积肥四万担。七区召开全区村干部会，讲解政策，大家情绪很高，纷纷订出积肥种麦计划。区上根据各村的具体种麦计划，也订出了全区的计划。全区旱地种麦约占旱地总数百分之六十六，水地种麦占水地百分之八十。园子地也争取种上麦子。旱地水地争取上二十五担到卅担肥。反之在宣传政策不好或未进行宣传的地方，群众思想混乱，生产情绪是不高。如三区西戍基点，群众对政策不蹬底，当领导上提出扩大麦田积肥时，群众劲头不大，只说晚庄稼多，串麦不行等。\n    岭后在讨论串种麦缺肥时，老汉孙时香说：我去年串种麦就是用油搓了麦种，一斗麦种用一斤油就行，串种上顶上底肥。一区南庄村在酝酿讨论串麦时，有的人提出还叫串种麦哩，咱去年串就吃了亏，还不如一年一季哩。王金水说：“咱村王寿勋去年麦子的早，今年的麦子每亩打了五斗，主要是你串的迟了。”大家都同意这意见，经讨论，全村旱地要种到百分之七十五。"

Last year, he wrote a new novel dedicated to the Leningrad guerrillas, and this year he wrote a play satirizing American bourgeois morality.\n　　△\"New Times,\" an authoritative publication reflecting Soviet foreign policy, was originally a bi-monthly publication. Since it was changed to a weekly publication on New Year's Day last year, the length has remained the same, and four versions in Russian, English, French, and German are published simultaneously.\n　　△The Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences published a new magazine in early March this year, edited by Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences, Ostrovitianov, with economists such as Varga, Varga, Vazhlov, and Gladkov serving as editorial board members.

Upon encountering the enemy's vanguard company (8th Company), they acted bravely and decisively, taking swift action and preemptively launching a fierce attack on the enemy. Catching the enemy off guard, after only 37 minutes of intense fighting, they completely annihilated the enemy's vanguard 8th Company and routed the main force of the enemy's forward troops, killing and wounding over 130 enemy soldiers, including the company commander. Sixty-three enemy soldiers were captured, including a deputy battalion commander, instructor, deputy company commander, and platoon leader. The captured items included four light machine guns, two 60mm mortars, one submachine gun, twenty-five rifles, two pistols, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and a portion of other military supplies, which are currently being inventoried.\n\n【Central Hebei Electric Dispatch】The militia and armed work teams of Xiongxian and Anci counties are continuously striking against grain-grabbing enemies and protecting the autumn harvest by force. On September 6th, the armed work team of a certain district in Xiongxian County, in coordination with the armed work team of a certain district in Xingu, suddenly raided the pseudo-large village stationed in Bayangzhuang to seize grain. After 25 minutes of fierce fighting, they captured two bandits, seized five rifles and 370 rounds of ammunition, and drove away the pseudo-large village head. On the same day, the armed work teams and militia of two districts, in coordination with the armed demolition team of Xiongxian County, attacked the pseudo-large village of Xizan, capturing two pseudo-bao chiefs and one pseudo-reserve team member alive, seizing one rifle and sixty rounds of ammunition. The remaining bandits fled in disarray. On September 8th, the armed work teams of several districts, in coordination with the demolition team, attacked the pseudo-large village stationed in the Mangmangkou village northeast of Baigou, north of Daying. Due to the brave actions of the armed work teams, the battle ended in a few minutes, completely resolving the pseudo-large village and capturing fifteen people alive, seizing three pistols and over a hundred rounds of ammunition. On September 5th, the Xiongxian demolition team captured a Dragon Bay bandit spy in Guanlima Village (west of Zangang), seizing a pistol. On the same day, the armed work team of a certain district captured a bandit reserve team member alive in Mijiawu Village (north of Zangang), seizing a rifle and 225 rounds of ammunition. Cadres and militia of a certain district in Anci County also harassed more than 500 bandits of the 25th Regiment of Anci, who had sneaked into the pier to seize the autumn harvest, on September 4th. Upon hearing gunfire, the bandits abandoned pancakes all over the street and fled in a panic.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 平西我军歼匪二百　雄县安次民兵主动出击保秋\n\n1948-09-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　平西我军歼匪二百\n  　雄县安次民兵主动出击保秋\n    【北岳电】十二日上午平西我军某部为打击琉璃河周口店修路敌，进到甘池（涿县西北）途中，遇匪九十四军四十三师一百二十八团出犯，当与敌尖兵连（八连）遭遇，即英勇果敢，火速动作，先发制人，向敌猛冲，使敌措手不及，激战仅三十七分钟，即干脆彻底歼敌尖兵八连全部，击溃敌前队主力，毙伤敌连长以下一百三十余名。俘获敌副营长指导员副连长排长等六十三名。缴获轻机枪四挺，六零炮两门，冲锋枪一支，步枪二十五支，短枪两支，子弹数千发，其他军用品一部，正清查中。\n    【冀中电】雄县、安次民兵武工队，不断打击抢粮敌人，武装保护秋收。九月六日，雄县某区武工队配合新固某区武工队，突然奔袭驻八洋庄抢粮之伪大乡，经二十五分钟激战，捉匪二，得大枪五支，子弹三百七十发，并将伪大乡打跑。当天某某两区武工队民兵，配合雄县武装爆炸组，袭击西昝伪大乡，活捉伪保长两名，伪后备队员一名，得大枪一支，子弹六十发。其余匪溃逃。九月八日，某某等区武工队配合爆炸组，袭击驻大营以北白沟东北茫茫口村的伪大乡，由于武工队动作勇猛，几分钟就结束战斗，将伪大乡全部解决，活捉十五名，得手枪三支，一百多发子弹。九月五日，雄县爆炸组，在关李马浒（昝岗西）捉住龙湾匪谍报员一名，得手枪一支。当天某区武工队在米家务（昝岗北）活捉匪后备队员一名，得枪一支，子弹二百二十五发。安次某区干部、民兵，亦于九月四日，袭扰窜到码头抢秋的安次匪二十五团五百余人，匪闻枪声后，遗弃满街大饼，狼狈逃去。"

All defending enemy troops were annihilated, with none escaping. The results of the battle are currently being tallied.\n　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 24th] The People's Liberation Army, attacking Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, has completely occupied the Jinan commercial port and the entire outer city, and is currently engaged in the final stage of street fighting in the inner city. As of the morning of the 23rd, the total number of enemy troops annihilated and those who revolted had reached over 60,000. The Liberation Army began its offensive on the night of the 16th. After several days and nights of fierce fighting, it broke through three lines of heavily fortified defense zones on a broad front spanning over a hundred li in all directions, successively capturing Qihe, Changqing, Wang Sherenzhuang, Zhangxia, Yide, Gushan, Zhonggong and other satellite strongholds of Jinan. On the afternoon of the 19th, when the Liberation Army attacked the commercial port and the suburbs, General Wu Huawen, commander of the Kuomintang 96th Army and concurrently commander of the 84th Division, immediately led the entire 84th Division and the Independent Brigade of the 96th Army in revolt, joining the People's Liberation Army. This unit has now been transferred to the rear of the liberated area. The Liberation Army occupied the airport west of the commercial port at 8:00 PM on the 19th. It launched an offensive against the commercial port on the night of the 20th, and completely occupied the commercial port by dusk on the 22nd. Immediately afterwards, it launched an attack on the city, capturing most of the outer city that night, and completely occupying the outer city by noon on the 23rd. On the night of the 23rd, it launched another attack on the inner city and had already entered. Due to the overwhelming superiority and rapid victory of the Liberation Army, and because Chiang Kai-shek's so-called reinforcements were still far away in Xuzhou and Bengbu at this time, any resistance from the remnants of Wang Yaowu's troops in Jinan's inner city was clearly meaningless.

    "content": "Column: Reader Correspondence\n\n　　\"By Whose Decree Was I Swept Out the Door?\"\n  　Xian County Party Committee Has Investigated and Replied\n    Editor's Note: It is very good that the Xian County Party Committee has earnestly examined and corrected errors in its work, and promptly investigated and replied to the opinions of the Party newspaper. This is the attitude that every Communist Party member should have towards the Party newspaper. Responsible comrades in various localities and departments should adopt this attitude when criticized or censured by the Party newspaper on a certain issue; otherwise, it is a lack of organization and discipline, which is not permissible. Comrade Sun Zhen failed to conduct thorough investigations in the village when writing on behalf of someone, resulting in an incomplete reflection of the problem, and some individual places were even erroneous. This should alert future ghostwriters to pay attention to conducting calm, multi-faceted analyses and, if possible, actual investigations to avoid one-sided exaggeration. In addition, Li Shuwen's attitude upon returning to the village after receiving education from the People's Army is not permissible and should be thoroughly reviewed and corrected, and he should obey the leadership of the government.\n\n    To the editors and reader comrades:\n    The following is a reply regarding the articles \"By Whose Decree Was I Swept Out the Door?\" published in People's Daily No. 46 and \"Where Was the Mistake?\" published in No. 68:\n\n    In our county, in some villages, there are indeed very serious instances of compulsory orders violating Party policies during conscription. Our county welcomes the criticism raised in the newspaper and has made a deep examination and correction. According to the situation in Monan, the \"parading through the streets\" and \"sealing the door\" were both facts at the time. After this serious error occurred, the county party committee also severely criticized the district and village cadres and set a deadline for the immediate return of the original items and the unsealing of the door. The main reason for this serious situation was that Li Xuezhong (real name Li Shujun) had embezzled 140 catties of village public grain to buy land and seized five mu of school land, used village timber to build houses, etc., when he was the village chief in the past. At the same time, his work style was very bad. His family was originally poor peasants, but in recent years they have successively divided up eleven mu of land, increasing from eight mu to nineteen mu, and both brothers at home have married wives. His younger brother returned from the army and did not go back, and people said that his family had forgotten their roots. He lived at home, and the village still treated him as a military dependent, and his mother sometimes acted improperly, so the masses hated him very much.\n\n    When conscription began, Li Shuwen not only did not automatically return to the team, but instead gathered five or six deserters to curse in the streets, threatening, \"Let's see who dares to mobilize me.\" When Wei Chuansheng's mother discussed the work of returning to the team at the group meeting, she suggested that his family should join the army, but he actually went to her door to block it and curse. He refused to be mobilized, and some of the village cadres had prejudices against him and had xenophobic thoughts, so they proposed that if he did not go, he should be driven out of Monan Street. Because his ancestral home was Zhangzhigen, where he also had houses and land, the masses stood up, detained him, and sealed his door. So, the problem was not simply that he was swept out the door because he refused to return to the team.\n\n    After the county party committee discovered this, it immediately instructed the district cadres to solve it, but due to the district cadres' face-saving and undisciplined thinking, the solution was delayed and not actively pursued. After the county gave three instructions and made severe criticisms, it was resolved (it has now been resolved for two months). The door was unsealed, and all the things were returned. He said that three hoes were missing, so the peasant association's hoes were used to replace one and 150,000 yuan was compensated. The camera bag and other items he brought back from the army were all returned.\n\n    Finally, because Li Shuwen's other problems have not yet been resolved, he has not yet returned to the team. This manuscript was not originally written by Li Xuezhong himself, but by Comrade Sun Zhen after hearing the person's face-to-face conversation in the county political office. He did not go to the village to learn more, so it is somewhat one-sided, only mentioning the mistakes of the district cadres and village cadres, but not mentioning the aspect of his return to the team. Furthermore, four names were mistaken in this draft: Li Xuezhong's original name is Li Shujun; Li Xuewen is Li Shuwen; there is no Comrade Liu as the secretary of the county party committee; Comrade Han, the deputy secretary of the county party committee, is the deputy secretary of the district party committee.\n\n    　　　　　　　Xian County Party Committee\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### “把我扫地出门是谁的法令”？　献县县委已检查答复\n\n1948-09-26\n第1版()\n专栏：编读往来\n\n　　“把我扫地出门是谁的法令”？\n  　献县县委已检查答复\n    编者按：献县县委认真检查纠正工作中的错误，并对党报意见及时检查答复，这是很好的。这是每一共产党员对党报应有的态度。各地各部门负责同志在某一问题上受到党报指摘或批评时均应采取此种态度，否则即是无组织、无纪律，是不许可的。孙振同志在代笔时未能到村深入调查，以致反映问题不够全面，个别地方并有错误，应引起以后代笔者注意，要冷静的多方分析，尽可能实际调查，以免片面夸大。另外，李书文受过人民军队的教育，回村这样态度是不允许的，应很好检讨改正，服从政府的领导。编辑及读者同志：\n    关于人民日报第四十六号所登载的“把我扫地出门是谁的法令？”及六十八号所登“错误在那里？”两文答复如下：\n    我县在参军中有的村庄是存在着很严重的强迫命令违犯党的政策的地方，报上给提出批评，我县很欢迎，并且作了深刻检讨与纠正。按陌南问题发生，当时“游街”“封门”俱是事实。这种严重错误发生后，县委也对该区干、村干提出严格批评，并限期立即退回原物启封其门。闹成这样严重的原因，主要是该李学忠（真名李书君）过去担任村长时贪污，用村公粮一百四十斤买地，霸占学地五亩，用村中木头盖房等，同时，作风很坏。他家原本是贫农，这几年先后分了十一亩地，由八亩增到十九亩，在家的弟兄两个都娶上了媳妇。他弟弟在部队上回来不回去了，人们都说他家忘本。他在家中住着，村中还按军属优待他，他母亲有时还发歪，所以群众很痛恨他。\n    参军开始了，该李书文不但不自动归队，反而拉拢五六个逃亡战士在一块骂街，扬言“看哪个敢来动员我”，魏川生的母亲在小组会上讨论归队工作时，曾提出他家应参军，而他竟到人家门口堵门骂街。动员他不服，村干部中有一部分人与他有成见，存在排外思想，即提出如他不去，即赶出他陌南街去。因他老家是张支根，那里他有房也有地，当时群众就起来了，把他扣起来，封了他家门。所以说这个问题不是单单的因为动员李书文归队，他不归队而扫地出了门。\n    县委发觉后，即马上指示区干解决，但由于区干存在好面子与无纪律的思想，致拖延不积极去解决。经县指示了三次，并提出严格批评后才解决了（现已解决了两个月了）。门启封东西完全退回，他说没了三张锄，当将农会之锄补上一张并赔了十五万元。其在部队上弄回来之照像机皮包等都退回去了。\n    最后因该李书文其他问题还未解决清，所以现在还未归队。此稿原本不是李学忠自己所写，而是孙振同志在县政治处，听到该人面谈而写成，没有到村去再了解，所以让人看了是有些片面性的，光是该区干部村干部的错处，而没提到他该归队的方面。再者此一稿内弄错了四个名字：李学忠原名李书君；李学文是李书文；县委书记并没有个刘同志；县委副书记韩同志是区委副书记。\n    　　　　　　　献县县委"

Medical orderly Niu Mingying was rescuing the wounded in the battle of Dongjia Village, Xugou County, when she herself was wounded. Despite this, she insisted on rescuing the wounded, bandaging them well before applying medicine and bandaging herself. Medical orderly Zhang Jinzhong, during the battle to attack Baijiazhuang in Jinyuan County, organized two cooks to rescue the wounded on the front lines. At a distance of fifty meters from the enemy, one cook was wounded, and the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, making it impossible to advance. Zhang Jinzhong was resourceful and immediately consulted with Squad Leader Bai Xiaowu of the small artillery unit, asking him to provide fire support and rescued nine wounded soldiers. Doctor Li Yin carried a machine gun for the soldiers during the march. During the struggle to protect wheat in Xiaoyizhuang'er, he saw four comrades wounded and immediately organized medical orderly Liu Heguang to quickly carry all the wounded down. In this unit, nine medical personnel including Niu Mingying were wounded while rescuing the wounded, and three comrades including Sun Ai'er and Wu Guanzhong gloriously sacrificed themselves while rescuing the wounded. The above comrades were all awarded merits or commendations in the battle evaluation. Under the general objective of \"everything for the front, for the safety of the wounded,\" the medical personnel of this unit not only persisted in their work in close proximity to the enemy (only a hundred meters away from the enemy's bunker when attacking Baijiazhuang) but also were good at overcoming difficulties. When medical equipment was incomplete, ordinary sterilized knives were used as substitutes. When medical cotton and bandages ran out, quilts were taken apart and sheets were torn up, and sterilized to replenish the supply. Under extremely difficult conditions, they stopped bleeding and removed shrapnel for the wounded, thus greatly reducing the mortality rate of the wounded.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋中解放军某部医务人员　浴血救护负伤同志\n\n1948-09-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋中解放军某部医务人员\n  　浴血救护负伤同志\n    【晋中讯】华北人民解放军某部医务工作者于晋中战役英勇进行救护工作。卫生员牛明英在徐沟县东贾村战斗中抢救伤员时，自己也负了伤，仍坚持把伤员抢救下来后，给伤员包扎好了，才给自己上药包扎。卫生员张金忠，在攻晋源县白家庄战斗中，曾组织二炊事员往火线抢救伤员，在距敌五十米处，一炊事员负伤，敌炮火很猛，无法前进，张金忠机动灵活，立即与小炮班长白小武等商量，请其以火力协助，抢救了九个伤员。医生李银戮行军中替战士扛机枪，在孝义庄儿上护麦斗争中看到四个同志负了伤，立即组织卫生员刘和光把伤员全部迅速背下来。该部卫生员因抢救伤员而负伤的有牛明英等九人，孙爱儿、武贯忠等三同志因抢救伤员而光荣牺牲。以上诸同志在战评中均分别受到记功或表扬。该部医务人员在“一切为了前线，为了伤员安全”的总目标下，不仅在距敌极近的情况下（攻白家庄时仅距敌碉百十公尺）坚持工作，且善于克服困难。医疗器械不全，即以普通刀子消毒代替，药棉绷带用完了，则拆被子撕被单，经过消毒来补充，他们在非常困难的条件下，为伤员止血取弹片，因而伤员死亡率大为减少。"

The Polish Workers' Party organ, the People's Voice newspaper, emphasized on the 15th when discussing this matter: The current food shortage \"has no objective basis but is caused by the clandestine activities of capitalist elements—enemies of the working class. Saboteurs are consciously brewing alarming noises, spreading anxiety, and frightening naive consumers; at the same time, they hide goods behind counters and in warehouses to obtain huge profits.\" The People's Voice newspaper continued: Fortunately, we have sufficient goods and political and economic methods to eliminate the saboteurs, and they will be dealt a heavy blow. The organization of state-owned stores and cooperatives will \"allocate meat, adjust prices, eliminate speculators as soon as possible, and ensure fair and uniform distribution throughout the year by eliminating the seasonal shortages that have enriched speculators.\" The People's Voice newspaper also warned: \"Organized workers will teach those who need to be taught not to mess with the workers' daily bread.\"\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania continue to increase rations and lower prices to improve the lives of the working people. Czechoslovakia has increased the bread ration for children under twelve from 20 pounds to 21 pounds per month, and for adults from 21 pounds to 26 pounds, since September 1st; workers and mothers with children receive even more. From November, the sugar ration will be increased from 2 pounds 1.5 ounces to 3 pounds per month, and workers will receive an extra pound of sugar and 3.5 ounces of lard for Christmas. This action by the Czechoslovak government has won the heartfelt support of the working people throughout the country. Employees in various regions have sent telegrams, letters, or resolutions to the President, the Cabinet, and the Central Action Committee of the National Front, expressing their deep gratitude. The Romanian government decided on September 15th to generally reduce prices again from October 1st. The decision pointed out that this is because workers are full of labor enthusiasm, labor productivity has greatly increased, and production costs have been greatly reduced after the nationalization of banks, industry, and transportation, and industrial products have greatly increased. The Hungarian government also announced on the 14th of this month that the prices of canned fruits and canned vegetables would be reduced by 25 percent.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 波工人党“人民呼声”报著论　抨击投机分子操纵市场  捷罗匈增加配给降低物价改善人民生活\n\n1948-09-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　波工人党“人民呼声”报著论\n  　抨击投机分子操纵市场\n    捷罗匈增加配给降低物价改善人民生活\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】电通社十五日讯：过去两周中，波兰各城市发生肉类、牛油、脂肪、及食糖等物的缺货现象，波兰工人党机关报人民呼声报，十五日于论及此事时着重指出：目前的粮荒“并无客观的基础，而是由资本主义分子——工人阶级的敌人——暗地的活动所引起的；破坏分子有意识地酝酿惊人的嚣闹，散布不安，吓唬天真的消费者；而同时，他们却把货物藏在柜台里，藏在库房里，从而获取大利。”人民呼声报继称：我们幸而有足够的货物，和政治经济的方法来清除破坏分子，他们将受到重大的打击。国营商店与合作社的组织，将“尽早达到肉类的分配、调整价格，清除投机分子，并以消除曾使投机分子致富的季节性缺货现象的方法，来确保全年公正与一律的分配。”人民呼声报并警告称：“有组织的工人们将教训那些需要教训的人们，不要在工人每日的面包上来捣乱。”\n    【新华社陕北二十一日电】捷克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚三国继续增加配给、降低物价，以改善劳动人民生活。捷克自九月一日起将十二岁以下儿童的面包配给量自每月二十磅增加至二十一磅，成人自二十一磅增加至二十六磅，工人与带孩子的母亲超过此数。十一月起，食糖配给量将自每月二磅一两半增加至三磅，工人在圣诞节的配给将额外增加一磅糖和三两半猪油。捷克政府此举获得全国劳动人民衷心拥戴，各地职工均致电、致函、或通过决议向总统、内阁与民族阵线中央行动委员会表示深切的感激。罗马尼亚政府九月十五日决议自十月一日起再度普遍减低物价，决议指出这是因为在银行、工业与运输业国有化以后，工人们充满了劳动热情，劳动生产率大为提高，生产成本已大为减低，工业产品已大为增加。匈牙利政府亦于本月十四日宣布罐头水果与罐头蔬菜的价格降低百分之二十五。"

In addition, 100 jin of millet had been stolen. The reasons for these losses are: (1) Some district leaders were guilty of bureaucracy and their work was not thorough. For example, the Seventh District once reported \"inspecting the Zijingguan Granary several times in the rain,\" but the specific inspection this time revealed that 1,200 jin of millet had gone bad. (2) Some district cadres did not pay enough attention to financial and grain work, considering it to be the job of the finance department and adopting an attitude of indifference. (3) Some districts neglected leadership in financial and grain work, allowing finance assistants to do other administrative work. For example, the county discovered that more than 300 jin of white flour had spoiled in the Yushanpu Granary of the Seventh District, and immediately notified the district finance assistant to go and inspect it as soon as possible.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Moscow, 19th: The Soviet Foreign Ministry has issued the following communiqué regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Korea: On September 10th, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea passed an appeal to the governments of the Soviet Union and the United States, requesting the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea. The appeal stated that the establishment of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea and the formation of a unified Korean government by representatives of different political persuasions from North and South Korea, representing the will of the vast majority of the Korean people, is a guarantee that complete order and public tranquility will be maintained throughout Korea during and after the withdrawal of foreign troops. It is well known that after defeating the Japanese Kwantung Army in the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops liberated Korea from the Japanese aggressors and, in accordance with agreements between the Allies, remained in Korea north of the 38th parallel, while American troops remained in Korea south of the 38th parallel. The presence of Soviet troops in the territory of North Korea has provided the Korean people with ample opportunity to establish democratic administrative institutions and has provided friendly assistance to the regeneration of the Korean nation. The number of Soviet troops in North Korea has gradually decreased. In September 1947, the Soviet government proposed to the United States government the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, and subsequently reiterated its readiness to immediately withdraw Soviet troops from North Korea, provided that the United States government simultaneously withdraw American troops from South Korea. However, the United States government has not yet agreed to this. The Soviet government has reported the issue of the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, as proposed by the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Presidium, having considered the aforementioned appeal of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, recognizes that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea is timely and expresses the hope that the United States government will also agree to withdraw American troops from South Korea, as requested by the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea. In accordance with the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union hereby resolves: (1) to withdraw Soviet troops stationed in North Korea to Soviet territory; (2) to order the Soviet Ministry of Armed Forces to begin withdrawing Soviet troops from North Korea no later than the second half of October this year, and to complete this work by January 1, 1949.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Reports from various sources: US Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference in Washington on the 19th that the United States \"does not intend to withdraw US troops from South Korea.\" This, at a time when the Korean People's Supreme Assembly has requested the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea, and the Soviet Union has announced its withdrawal from North Korea, once again exposes the US imperialist conspiracy to enslave the Korean people to the condemnation of world opinion. Previously, Syngman Rhee's representative in the United States, Chen Yoh Han, catering to the wishes of his American masters, stated at a press conference in New York that even if Soviet troops withdraw from Korea, the Syngman Rhee government will request that American troops remain in Korea. Furthermore, a broadcast from Pyongyang Radio quoted by TASS on the 17th stated that an agreement had recently been concluded between the Syngman Rhee puppet government and the US occupation forces command in South Korea, stipulating that South Korean police and troops will be entirely under the command of Americans, and that the US military has not set a date for its withdrawal from Korea, but will remain in South Korea indefinitely. The broadcast also pointed out that the puppet government had already transferred coal mines and power industries to the Americans on September 10th, and that the entire economy of South Korea is now under American control. All of this proves that the transfer of eleven departments under its jurisdiction to the Syngman Rhee government by the US military government in South Korea ten days ago was the most hypocritical thing possible.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏联外交部发表公报：  苏军即将撤离北鲜  马歇尔公然表示美国不愿自南鲜撤军\n\n1948-09-26\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏联外交部发表公报：\n    苏军即将撤离北鲜\n    马歇尔公然表示美国不愿自南鲜撤军\n    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科十九日电，苏联外交部发表关于苏军撤出朝鲜的公报如下：朝鲜最高人民议会九月十日通过一项致苏美两国政府的呼吁，请求苏美军队同时撤离朝鲜。呼吁声称，朝鲜最高人民议会的建立以及由此议会组成的南北朝鲜不同政治倾向的代表的统一的朝鲜政府之成立，代表南北朝鲜绝大多数人民的意志，乃是外国军队撤离朝鲜时期及其以后朝鲜全境将保有完全的秩序与公共的安宁之保证。众所周知，苏军击败日本关东军后于一九四五年秋季将朝鲜自日本侵略者手中予以解放，并遵照盟国间的协议驻留于朝鲜北纬卅八度以北之地，美军则驻留于朝鲜北纬三十八度以南之地。苏军驻留于北朝鲜的领土上，曾给予朝鲜人民以建立民主行政机构的充分机会，并对朝鲜民族的再生提供了友好的协助。北朝鲜苏军的数目逐渐减少。苏联政府曾于一九四七年九月向美国政府提议苏、美军队同时撤离朝鲜，其后并曾一再重申准备立即将苏军撤离北朝鲜，只要美国政府同时将美军撤离南朝鲜。然而美国政府对此至今未予同意。苏联政府已将朝鲜最高人民议会所提苏、美军队同时撤离朝鲜的问题报告苏联最高苏维埃主席团，主席团考虑了朝鲜最高人民议会上述呼吁，承认将苏军撤离北朝鲜是合时的，并表示希望美国政府也同意将美军撤离南朝鲜，象朝鲜最高人民议会所请求者一样。苏联部长会议遵奉苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定，兹作下列决议：（一）将驻留北朝鲜的苏军撤至苏联领土；（二）命令苏联武装部队部不迟于今年十月下半月开始将苏军撤离北朝鲜，至一九四九年一月一日完成此项工作。\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：美国务卿马歇尔十九日在华盛顿记者招待会上表示：美国“不拟自南朝鲜撤退美军”。这在朝鲜人民最高议会要求美苏同时自朝鲜撤军，及苏联宣布从北朝鲜撤军的今日，又一次使美帝国主义的奴役朝鲜人民的阴谋暴露于世界舆论谴责之前。前此，李承晚驻美代表陈约翰即奉承美国主子旨意，在纽约记者招待会上声称：即使苏军撤离朝鲜，李承晚政府也将请求美军驻留朝鲜。又塔斯社十七日所引的平壤电台广播称：李承晚走狗政府和南朝鲜美占领军司令部之间最近缔结了协定，规定南朝鲜警察和军队将全属美国人统辖，而美军则未确定撤离朝鲜日期，即无限期留驻南朝鲜。广播并指出：伪政府已于九月十日将煤矿和动力工业移交给美国人，南朝鲜的全部经济现已在美国的控制之下。这些都证明，旬日前南朝鲜美军政府将其所辖十一个部门移交给李承晚政府，是最虚伪不过了。"

County-level cadres in Shenfu County personally went to the homes of military families to check and solicit opinions on preferential treatment work. The representative meeting of Xixiangwang Village in Lishi convened a meeting of young men joining the army to jointly determine methods for providing preferential treatment through farming assistance. Cadres in Zhuhua Village took the lead in working in the fields with the substitutes and checking on the spot. Pengfengshan Village formed several farming assistance teams, each led by a cadre to ensure that the military families' crops were carefully and efficiently cultivated. Xuejiapo Village also established an evaluation system for the quality of farming assistance. Each village in Lin County has established a Military Support Committee or Military Support Team. In Sanjiao Village, more than a hundred Party members, cadres, and militiamen helped 32 military martyrs' families to go to the fields for production. When the new soldier Zhang Guilin returned home to visit, he was very happy to see this and returned to his unit. All localities have also begun to pay attention to organizing women from military martyrs' families to participate in agricultural production.

    "title": "Protecting Draft Animals",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-27",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency Short Commentary\n\nProtecting Draft Animals\n\nToday, this agency published a news item regarding livestock deaths in North China. The reduction and death of livestock is not a unique phenomenon in parts of North China; similar situations exist in other liberated areas as well. Due to the decade-long war, the number of livestock in rural areas has already decreased significantly. In particular, last year, due to the severe devastation by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the famine, and certain errors in our policies regarding supporting the front lines, mutual aid labor exchange, and land reform, the reduction of draft animals was more severe than in the past. In order to develop agricultural production and improve our production even slightly, this issue deserves serious attention from leadership organs in all regions. Based on reports from North China and past reports from other regions, we believe the following three issues are worth raising for everyone to study.\n\nFirst, wartime labor conscription is one of the important reasons for the reduction of draft animals. In particular, long-distance conscription is more likely to cause concerns among farmers. Last winter, in order to protect draft animals, the Bohai Region of Shandong Province stipulated that draft animals in the central area should cease conscription and that military supply transportation should be changed to a \"contracted relay transportation\" method. This involves organizing the livestock and vehicles of the masses in sections to transport military supplies, with a certain amount of freight paid according to the distance and weight. In this way, military supply transportation changes from a burden on the people to a profitable side business for the people. Farmers not only no longer sell their livestock but also buy back livestock to contract for military supply transportation. At the same time, transportation capacity is greatly improved. In the past, a large cart could only carry 700 jin and travel 30-40 li per day, but now it can carry more than 1,000 jin and travel 60-70 li per day, one large cart being equivalent to two large carts in the past. In the past, the government did not pay freight but had to provide grain and fodder for the people and horses of two large carts. Now, with only one large cart used, the freight paid is not more than the fodder provided in the past, and may even be less. Similar experiences in North China and Northwest China have proven that stopping the conscription of draft animals in the central area and changing to a contracted transportation method is an important measure to protect draft animals and benefit both the public and private sectors. At the same time, it can also limit the arbitrary conscription by rear-area organs, which hinders mass production.\n\nSecond, violating the principles of voluntariness and equal value in mutual aid labor exchange is another important reason for the reduction of draft animals. In the past, in some places, the consent of the draft animal owners was often not sought, and draft animals were arbitrarily sent to till fields or participate in mutual aid labor exchange, and even the land of military and government families had to be tilled first (in some areas, even the draft animals of middle peasants had to till the land for poor peasants first) before they could till their own land. The compensation for draft animals participating in mutual aid labor exchange was often too low (such as one animal labor being equivalent to only one human labor), or even non-existent. In this way, naturally no farmer would want to raise draft animals. In order to encourage farmers to raise draft animals, the principles of voluntariness and equal value must be strictly observed in mutual aid labor exchange, that is, the use of draft animals must be with the consent of the owners, and the method of valuing labor exchange must be fair and reasonable so that farmers who raise draft animals can also obtain certain benefits from the mutual aid labor exchange. Draft animals raised by middle peasants are equally protected and must not be discriminated against. In order to truly realize the voluntary principle of labor exchange, governments in all regions must announce to the people, prohibit all coercion, and allow all members joining labor exchange groups to freely withdraw from the labor exchange group at any time without any obstruction.\n\nThird, last year, during the land reform, many draft animals of landlords and rich peasants were often distributed to several peasant families to be jointly raised. After the land reform, most poor peasants are still unable to raise a draft animal independently, which is certainly an objective difficulty. However, joint raising of draft animals still has many problems that are not easy to solve today, such as everyone being unwilling to feed more fodder when taking turns feeding, and everyone not cherishing the animals when taking turns using them. Due to insufficient nutrition and overwork, jointly raised draft animals often become increasingly thin and even die. Today's mutual aid teams and labor exchange groups are still based on individual economy, with each family as a production unit, and the farmers' self-interest cannot be immediately eliminated. Therefore, such phenomena are really difficult to avoid. In the future, it is best to encourage independent raising of draft animals. Farmers who independently raise draft animals can exchange labor with farmers who do not have draft animals, or lease them out, sign contracts, specifying how much land to till, how much fodder to provide, or other compensation, or simply sell the livestock to farmers who need draft animals. In some areas, forcing collectivism and encouraging joint raising of draft animals has proven to be completely inappropriate today.\n\nThe above three points are the important keys to protecting draft animals. In addition, there are other methods of protection and reward, such as appropriately reducing the burden on draft animals (such as raising one ox or mule can reduce the amount of public grain or public grass to be contributed), encouraging the breeding of draft animals, purchasing draft animals from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and training veterinarians to treat livestock diseases. Governments in all regions should learn from each other and earnestly promote these measures to protect draft animals in order to facilitate the recovery and improvement of rural production.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 保护耕畜\n\n1948-09-27\n第1版()\n专栏：新华社短评\n\n　　保护耕畜\n    今天本社发表了一个关于华北牲畜死亡的消息。牲畜的减少和死亡，并不是华北部分地区的特殊现象，其他各解放区亦有类似情形。农村中的牲畜由于十年的战争，已经大量减少，特别是去年由于国民党匪军的严重摧残，灾荒，和我们在支援前线、变工互助、土地改革中的某些政策上的错误，耕畜的减少比较过去更为严重。为着发展农业生产，把我们的生产提高一寸，这个问题值得引起各地领导机关严重注意。根据华北报导，和过去其他地区的报导，我们觉得有下列三个问题值得提出来供大家研究。\n    一、战争支差是引起耕畜减少的重要原因之一，尤其是长距离的支差，更容易引起农民的顾虑。去冬山东渤海区为着保护耕畜，曾经规定中心地区牲畜停止支差，军需运输改用“包工接力运输”办法。即分段组织群众的牲畜和车辆，包运军需物品，按路程，按重量，给以一定数量的运费。这样军需运输就从人民的负担，变为人民有利可图的副业，农民不但不再出卖牲畜，而且买回牲畜包运军需物品。同时运输力亦大大提高，过去一辆大车只装到七百斤，日行三四十里，现在可装一千多斤，日行六七十里，一辆大车可抵两辆大车。过去政府不给运费，但须供给两辆大车人马的粮秣。现在只用一辆大车，所付运费并不多于过去所供草料，甚至反而节省。华北、西北等地区也曾有类似的经验，证明中心地区停止耕畜支差，改用包运办法，是保护耕畜，公私两利的重要措施。同时亦可限制后方机关的随意支差，妨碍群众生产。\n    二、变工中违反自愿和等价的原则，是使耕畜减少的另一重要原因。过去有些地方往往不征求耕畜主人的同意，把耕畜随便派去代耕或参加变工，甚至必须先把军属工属的地耕好（曾经有些地区中农的耕畜还要先替贫农耕种），才能耕自己的地。耕畜参加变工往往代价太少（如一个畜工只顶一个人工），甚至毫无代价。这样，农民自然谁都不愿饲养耕畜。为着奖励农民饲养耕畜，在变工中必须严格遵守自愿和等价的原则，即使用耕畜必须征求主人的同意，变工计价办法必须公平合理，使饲养耕畜的农民也能从变工中获得一定的利益。中农所养耕畜同样保护，不得歧视。为了切实实现变工的自愿原则，各地政府必须布告人民，禁止一切强迫，必须允许一切加入变工组的成员随时自由退出变工组，不得有任何阻难。\n    三、去年在土改中，许多地主富农的耕畜，往往分给几家农民合养。土改以后大多数的贫农仍然无力独养一个耕畜，这固然是客观上的困难，但合养耕畜在今天还有很多问题不易解决，如轮流饲养大家不愿多喂草料，轮流使用大家不加爱惜。合养的耕畜由于营养不足和过度劳动，往往日益消瘦，以至于死。今天的互助组，变工组仍以个体经济为基础，一家一户为一生产单位，农民们的自利思想也不可能即时消灭。因此这样的现象，实在很难避免。今后最好奖励独养耕畜，独养耕畜的农民可与无耕畜的农民变工，或实行出租，订立合同，耕多少土地，供给多少草料，或其他代价，或者索性把牲口卖给需要耕畜的农民。有些地区强求集体，奖励合养耕畜，这在今天，证明是完全不适当的。\n    以上三点是保护耕畜的重要关键。此外还有其它保护和奖励的办法，如耕畜可以斟酌情形减轻负担（如养一牛骡即可少出多少公粮或公草），奖励繁殖耕畜，和向国民党统治区购买耕畜，培养兽医医治牲畜疾病等。这些保护耕畜的措施，各地政府均应互相学习，认真推行，以利农村生产的恢复和提高。"

According to a communication published in the Nanjing Kuomintang Central Daily News on August 2nd by a reporter \"after visiting wounded soldiers in Northern Anhui,\" the soldiers who sacrificed for the four families were subjected to cold neglect and abuse after being wounded. The communication stated: \"In Chuxian, a wounded officer of the Parachute Corps said: A few days ago, when more than 100 of their wounded brothers were sent to Huaiyuan, they couldn't find a place to rest. Nearly 2,000 wounded soldiers from other units were sent to Huaiyuan, and no one was responsible for helping them. So more than 2,000 wounded soldiers were lying on the streets of Huaiyuan, unattended. The weather was hot, and the seriously wounded couldn't bear it, and a few died that day.\" As for the situation in the Kuomintang's military hospitals, the communication reported: \"Medicines, nursing care, and nutritional products are all pitifully lacking.\" \"The Sixth Hospital in Chuxian and the Fourth Hospital in Mentai can be said to be the largest hospitals in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. The two hospitals usually have more than a thousand wounded soldiers, sometimes even reaching three thousand. Their pharmacies and operating rooms are all terribly simple. Surgical equipment is still old equipment from a long time ago. Nursing care is especially out of the question. The situation in some seriously wounded wards is difficult to describe. In terms of nutrition, it is especially difficult to imagine. The daily food cost for a wounded soldier is 70,000 yuan (including firewood, oil, salt, and vegetables, in addition to rice). 70,000 yuan can only buy two fried dough sticks, how can it provide nutrition to the wounded? In addition, there is a special nutrition fee, only 60,000 yuan per person per month, which is simply a joke.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 国民党军伤兵备受冷漠虐待\n\n1948-09-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　国民党军伤兵备受冷漠虐待\n    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据八月二日南京国民党中央日报刊载该报记者“访问皖北荣军之后”的通讯供认：为四大家族卖命的官兵，在受伤后备受冷漠与虐待。该通讯说：“在滁县的时候，一位伞兵总队的负伤军官说：几天前，他们一百多负伤的弟兄被送往怀远的时候，竟找不到歇脚的地方。其他部队的伤兵被送往怀远的，将近两千人，没有人负责去救助。所以二千多伤兵竟致卧倒在怀远的街上，无人过问。天气又热，重伤的受不了，当天就有少数死去的。”至于国民党的伤兵医院情形，该通讯报导：“医药、看护和营养品，全都缺乏得可怜。”“滁县的第六医院，门台子的第四医院可以说是津浦南段最大的医院，两院的伤兵平常都在一千以上，有时竟到三千。他们的药房和手术室，一切都是那样简单得可怕。手术器材还是很久以前的旧器材。看护尤其谈不到。好些重伤室，里面的情形是难于叙述。营养方面，尤其令人难于想象，一个伤兵每天的伙食费是七万元（除米以外，柴油盐菜均在内）。七万元只能买两根油条，对伤者哪里能有营养？另外有特别营养费，一个月每人只有六万元，这简直是笑话。”"

    "content": "Heroic Merit Citation Recipient He Bahu\n　　Comrade He Bahu, a recipient of a citation for great merit, is the squad leader of the second machine gun squad of the fourth company of the 914th regiment of a certain unit. After joining the army, he received education from the Party, his class consciousness was raised, he was active and responsible in his work, brave and calm in battle, and held infinite loyalty to the Party and the people. In the Shangzhuang battle to defend spring ploughing and the Xifancun battle in the Jinzhong Campaign, he disregarded his own safety in the most dangerous and difficult circumstances, twice covering the main force to successfully complete its mission.\n　　On May 8th, the entire 49th Division of the Yan bandit launched a multi-pronged attack on my Mengxian border. Zhao Junyi, the deputy division commander and commander of the first regiment of the division (who was captured in the Beishangshe battle on May 9th), bought off local ruffians with three silver dollars a day to form a \"Black Tiger Team\" and launched a fierce attack on the fourth company's position guarding Shangzhuang Village on the Shoumeng border, thus beginning a fierce battle. A battalion of Yan bandits launched assaults in several directions and engaged our company's soldiers in fierce hand-to-hand combat with bayonets. The enemy rushed up throwing grenades and engaging in bayonet charges, and were beaten back three times. In these three melee combats, He Bahu showed unparalleled bravery. He held his machine gun and fired fiercely at the enemy rushing in from the flanks, firing six bursts of ammunition, killing a large number of enemies, preventing them from rushing up, and ensuring the safety of the main force's flank. But when he retreated, the enemy had already rushed up and blocked his way. He fired back at the enemy with his machine gun and jumped into a ditch. Seeing that our two wounded soldiers' guns were unattended, he picked them up and started walking. The enemy blocked his way again. Bahu, carrying two rifles and a machine gun, detoured. By this time it was already dark. Because he was avoiding the enemy, he lost his way in the middle of the night and started going around in circles on the mountain. He thought: \"Am I deserting the battle by leaving the unit? No! I covered the main force to retreat, but I couldn't get down because the enemy blocked my way! And I saw the revolutionary weapons about to be lost, wouldn't it be wrong not to carry them? I am a member of the branch committee! The situation is unclear everywhere, where can I find the troops? I would rather die than be captured, this is the quality of a Communist Party member!\" After thinking it over, he decided to break through the encirclement at night and escape, and look for the troops in the direction of Mengcheng. He went up the mountain and got his bearings, then started walking, but who knew that the direction of Mengcheng had already been occupied by the enemy, sandwiching Bahu on the hillside. Before dawn, machine guns and cannons were firing intensely, and he watched the enemy running back and forth, getting closer and closer to him. He wondered: \"How can I break out? Can I keep these machine guns and rifles?\" Finally, he made up his mind to hide the machine gun and one rifle on the hillside, and fight the enemy with one rifle himself! As soon as he hid the gun, he saw that the enemy was surrounded by us and fighting each other. He was extremely happy. Although he hadn't eaten anything for a whole day and night, he still perked up and took the opportunity to kill his way up the mountain again, killing three enemies and joining the main force.\n　　On the morning of July 12th, the troops woke up from their sleep and set off running. Due to the urgency of the situation, the orders were very simple: \"The enemies in Nanzhuang, Dachang, and Xiaochang are now surrounded by us, and only the southwest corner of Xifan is to be the responsibility of our regiment.\" The troops immediately ran to the designated direction, but unexpectedly, the situation developed and tens of thousands of enemies in Xifan were breaking out from here. The vanguard troops had already captured prisoners and opened fire. The situation was tense, and the main force of the regiment had not yet had time to deploy. The enemy attacked from three sides, and three airplanes came to harass us. The troops in front retreated, and the soldiers of the fourth company accepted the arduous task of \"quickly counter-attacking and repelling the enemy! Resolutely prevent the enemy from breaking out from here\" in this tense atmosphere. As soon as Deputy Battalion Commander Hu's order was issued, the enemy's artillery shells, bullets, and machine gun bullets from the planes concentrated on our position, and the soldiers felt a little uneasy. Comrade He Bahu picked up his machine gun and fired two bursts of ammunition. After this attack, the enemy turned around and ran away. Then, squad leader Pan Cunshan and Cao Jucai took the lead in rushing up, and the first and seventh squads also rushed up. At this time, He Bahu was even more fearless. In order to ensure the safety of the charging troops, he still held his machine gun and was with the assault troops, preventing the enemy from launching several counter-attacks, leaving behind corpses, banners, and weapons, and fleeing back to their original entrenched Ditch in a panic, no longer daring to act fiercely. In this fierce battle, He Bahu's machine gun fired more than 700 rounds of ammunition, and the gun barrel turned red. Comrade Bahu's heart also calmed down, and the entire regiment turned from danger to safety. The dream of tens of thousands of enemies in Xifan to break out was dealt a head-on blow, and they no longer wanted to break out.

    "content": "Model Platoon for Strengthening the Troops\n    Zhang Kerang\n    The 4th Platoon of the Machine Gun Company of a certain unit of the Taiyuan Military Region, with three Party members out of ten soldiers, and under the leadership of Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun, experienced no desertions, casualties, or illnesses during the Jinzhong Campaign. At the celebration meeting on August 15th, the commander personally awarded them the red banner and honorary title of \"Model Platoon for Strengthening the Troops,\" and the entire platoon collectively received a commendation.\n    During the thirty-six days of the Jinzhong Campaign, they participated in twelve major battles, completing their tasks successfully in each one. Furthermore, due to the careful planning and flexible command of Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun, their care for the soldiers on the battlefield, and the timely reviews after battles, the platoon suffered no casualties. During the Chewang battle, they followed the 1st Battalion to attack the enemy near friendly forces. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua personally scouted the terrain ahead and led them forward with individual leaps. Although the enemy's firepower was fierce, they passed through safely. In the Wumaqiao battle, the heavy machine gun was only thirty or forty meters away from the enemy, and the soldiers were very nervous. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun personally crawled forward to scout the terrain and helped everyone build fortifications for cover. The enemy couldn't find their target and fired machine guns, rifles, and artillery at them, with more than a dozen mortar shells landing around them, but none of them were injured. When attacking the enemy in Xifan, a soldier stood up to look at the enemy. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua pulled the soldier down to find cover, and just as they hid, a burst of machine-gun fire came over. When the troops arrived at Wangjiazhai, it was almost dawn. The higher-ups ordered them to dig fortifications. Four members of the platoon suffered from eye problems, and everyone was afraid that digging would aggravate their condition, so they didn't let them dig. As a result, in two hours, six people dug two bunkers. During the attack on Beilai, they were very close to the enemy, making it easy to be detected, and they couldn't stay in one position for long. They made four fortifications in five hours and constantly changed positions. The soldiers in the platoon said, \"If it weren't for our platoon leader and deputy platoon leader, we wouldn't know what would have happened to us.\" At the same time, because they were meticulous, thorough, and frequent in their review of actions after each battle, such as Shi Haixiang standing up to look at the enemy in the Xifan battle, everyone criticized him during the review. Shi Haixiang said with emotion, \"Our platoon really cares about me; if it weren't for the platoon leader, I would have been done for.\" In this way, unfavorable actions in combat were overcome, avoiding casualties.\n    During the Jinzhong Campaign, thanks to the care and good management and education of the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader, the 4th Platoon not only experienced no desertions (from March until now), but also had no seriously ill members during the Jinzhong Campaign, consolidating their combat effectiveness. Four members of the platoon suffered from eye problems. Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun, fearing that their condition would worsen and reduce their combat effectiveness, personally dug air-raid shelters and built covers for them. When finding houses, they always let the soldiers sleep on the heated brick beds, while they took care of the guns in the courtyard. On the front lines, they always let the soldiers rest in covered areas, taking turns watching the guns themselves. For comrades with weak bodies, the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader helped carry their belongings and carried more guns. The soldiers said, \"Our platoon leader and deputy platoon leader love us like our own brothers; what are we afraid of!\" During this campaign, Platoon Leader Wang Jianhua often read the news to everyone, reporting good news and encouraging everyone's spirits, so that the soldiers did not feel distressed. Therefore, the soldiers said, \"When the platoon leader reported the good news, I don't know why, but I was very happy!\" They also did a good job of assigning tasks for explanation. The three Party members in the platoon each helped two non-Party members, holding individual talks every three to five days. In this way, the Party's prestige was enhanced, and the relationship between the masses and the Party members became closer, making the whole platoon more united. For example, Wang Xucheng helped Chen Honggao. Chen wanted to go home and said to Wang, \"I'm afraid we won't be able to go back there. Let's go back earlier.\" Wang immediately explained to Chen, \"We are the People's Liberation Army. If we don't defeat Yan Xishan, we can't live there. If we want to live a good life, we must first defeat Yan Xishan.\" Although Chen Honggao attempted to desert twice, no one in the platoon ever said he \"wanted to desert,\" nor did they criticize him. They always used self-criticism and commendation of merits in platoon meetings to carry out edification. In this way, Chen was moved and revealed his ideological burden: \"If it weren't for the care of the platoon leader and everyone, I would have left long ago....\" \"I tried to desert, but the platoon leader and comrades didn't say I wanted to desert. I can't do it again. How can I be worthy of the platoon leader and everyone!\" Once, when they arrived at a certain village, it was almost dawn. The soldiers went to sleep, and Deputy Platoon Leader Zhang Hongshun boiled water for everyone to wash their feet, wash their faces, and drink. Because the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader took good care of the soldiers, everyone's spirit of unity was very high, like brothers. When marching, they carried things for each other and fought to carry the machine guns. Although it was the hot summer season, and they were marching and fighting day and night, they were all energetic and successfully completed their combat missions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 巩固部队模范班\n张克让\n1948-09-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　巩固部队模范班\n    张克让\n    太原军区某部机炮连四班，全班十个人有三个党员，在班长王建华、副班长张鸿顺的领导下，在晋中战役中没逃亡、没伤亡、没病号，八月十五日庆功会上，司令员亲授了“巩固部队模范”班的红锦旗和光荣称号，全班集体立了功。\n    在晋中战役的三十六天中，他们参加了十二次较主要的战斗，在这十二次的战斗中，都圆满的完成了他们的任务，并且由于班长王建华同志副班长张鸿顺同志精心计划，指挥灵活，战场爱兵和战后的及时检讨，全班没有一个伤亡。车辋战斗时，他们随一营出击攻我友邻的敌人，班长王建华同志亲自到前面看好了地形，以个个跃进带上去，当时敌人的火力虽然打的很凶，但他们却安全的通过了。在五马桥战斗时，重机枪离敌人只三、四十米远，战士们很慌张，班长王建华同志副班长张鸿顺同志亲自爬到前面看了地形，又给大家做好工事隐蔽了。敌人找不见他们的目标，机枪、步枪、炮向他们打来，在他们周围落了十几个迫击炮弹，但他们都没有一个被打伤。攻击西范敌人时，一个战士站着看敌人，班长王建华拉着那个战士找下隐蔽地，刚隐蔽了，敌人的一梭子机枪即打了过来。部队到王家寨，天就快亮了。上级让挖工事，他们班有四个害眼病的，大家怕他们挖的上了火，更厉害了，不让他们挖，结果在两个钟头内，六个人挖好了两个地堡。打北赖时因距敌人很近，容易被敌人发觉，不能常在一个位置，他们即在五个小时内做好了四个工事，经常变换位置，这样班里的战士们说：“要不是咱们班长副班长，咱们还不知怎样了。”同时因为他们在每次战后对动作的检讨细致、深刻、经常，如史海祥在西范战斗站起来看敌人，大家在检讨时给了他个批评。史海祥感动的说：“咱们班真爱我，要不是班长，我就完了。”这样，就使战斗上不利的动作克服了，避免了伤亡。\n    晋中战役中，四班由于班长副班长爱兵和管理教育的好，不但没逃亡（从三月到现在）甚至在晋中战役中没有一个重病员，巩固了战斗力。班里有四个害眼病的，班长王建华和副班长张鸿顺怕他们上了火，眼病厉害了减少战斗力，他俩亲自给他们挖防空洞，做掩体。在找下房子时每次都是让战士们睡在炕上，自己在院子里照料枪。在阵地上，他俩总是让战士们在隐蔽地休息，自己轮流看枪。班里有身体弱的同志，每次行军正副班长照顾背东西。还要多扛枪，战士们说：“咱们正副班长就象咱的亲兄弟一样爱咱们，咱们还怕什么！”在这次战役中，班长王建华时常给大家念报，报告好消息，鼓动大家的情绪，使战士们不感到苦脑，因此战士们说：“班长给报告了好消息，心眼里不知怎么，可高兴哩！”他们分工解释也做的好，班里三个党员每人分工帮助两个群众，隔三五天即个别谈一次话，这样党的威信提高了，使群众和党员关系也密切了，使全班团结的更好。如王绪成帮助陈鸿皋，陈想回家就对王说：“这怕回不了咱那里了，咱早些回吧。”王马上给陈解释说：“咱们是人民的解放军，不把阎锡山打败，回去也在不住，要想过好光景，那就得先把阎锡山打败。”虽然陈鸿皋两次企图开小差，但班里总没人说过他“想开小差”，也没有批评过，总是在班务会上用检讨思想，表扬好处，进行感化的，这样使陈感动的揭开了自己的思想包袱：“我要不是班长和大家的关心早走了……。”“我企图开小差，班长和同志们还不说是想开小差，咱可再不了，怎样对得起班长和大家哩！”一次到某村时，天快亮了，战士们睡了，副班长张鸿顺同志给大家烧下开水，洗足、洗脸、喝。由于班长副班长照顾战士周到，大家团结的情绪非常高，象亲兄弟，行起军来就互相背东西，争着扛机枪，虽然是暑伏天，又加日夜行军打仗，但他们个个精神旺盛，胜利地完成了战斗务任。"

    "content": "[Jinzhong Dispatch] In the seventh district of Wenshui, the war support burden is unfairly distributed, and human and animal power are not adequately coordinated, leading to a widespread phenomenon of peasants selling donkeys. In Zhongzhuang Village, during the war support efforts, each ox averaged 8.5 war support workdays, each male laborer 12.4 workdays, and each donkey 29 workdays within eighty days. The donkey-raising masses felt the burden was too heavy, and some sold their donkeys, while others sold donkeys to buy oxen. Zhongzhuang Village had twelve donkeys, and on September 2nd, seven were sold in one day at the Macun meeting, and four oxen and horses were bought back. In Xicun Village, eight donkeys were exchanged for eight oxen and horses. In Dongcun Village, six donkeys were sold and three oxen were bought back. The masses in Tuta Village, who rely on raising donkeys to transport and sell coal for a living, also sold three donkeys. This phenomenon exists in most villages in the seventh district. When County Head Wang inspected war support production in the district, he further discovered that some villages had not kept accounts or made them public for a long time. For example, village cadres in Zhongzhuang Village raised donkeys without participating in long-term assignments. He immediately convened a cadre meeting to discuss solutions. In addition to criticizing the district cadres for their bad habit of ignoring problems, failing to solve them after discovering them, and failing to report them to higher authorities, the meeting, based on the opinions of the majority of the masses during the investigation, formulated four specific solutions: (1) Clear up the old accounts for the eighty days and make them public to everyone. Those who owe workdays should repay them or provide grain. If some poor people really cannot repay the workdays, they can be repaid after the autumn harvest. (2) Each village should establish an inspection committee to announce war support workdays every month and settle accounts every three months. (3) Human and animal power should be coordinated in a planned manner, saving animal power as much as possible. For example, when delivering grain and wheat, human power should be used more when possible. (4) Collective expenses distributed throughout the team are not recorded, and often the entire team and village bear the burden. At several meetings, it was determined that the county level and above should keep accounts to balance the burden between districts and villages.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 文水七区　战勤负担不公　农民纷纷卖驴\n\n1948-09-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　文水七区\n  　战勤负担不公\n  　农民纷纷卖驴\n    【晋中电】文水七区战勤负担不公，人畜力没有适当调剂，造成群众普遍卖驴现象。中庄村在支前中，八十天内平均牛出战勤工八点五个，男劳动力出十二点四个，毛驴出廿九个。养驴群众感到负担过重，有的把驴卖掉，有的卖驴换牛。中庄村有驴十二头，九月二日在马村会上一天就卖了七头，买回四头牛马。西村八头驴换了八头牛马。东村卖了六头驴买回三牛。土塔村群众长年靠养驴驮卖煤为生，也将驴卖了三头。这种现象在七区大部村庄都有。王县长到该区检查支前生产时，更发现有的村长期不算帐，不公布。如中庄村村干部养驴不支长差等。随即召集干部会议，讨论解决办法。会上除批评了区干部这种对问题熟视无睹、发现问题后既不解决又不向上级反映的坏作风外，并根据调查中多数群众的意见，定出四条具体的克服办法：（一）清理八十天的旧帐，向大家公布。欠工的还工或出粮。如有些贫苦群众着实还不起工，可以秋后补还。（二）各村成立检查委员会，每月公布战勤工，三个月结算一次。（三）人畜力有计划的调剂，尽可能节省畜力。如送粮送麦，可能时多用人力。（四）整个队里分配了集体花销不记帐，往往整个队与村负担起几次会上确定了县级以上的记帐，平衡区与区、村与村的负担。"

The慰问团 used meetings, informal discussions, and individual conversations at the front to solicit many valuable opinions from the front-line soldiers regarding work in the rear. The main points are: 1. Communication between the front and rear is not very good. Soldiers hope to understand the situation of land distribution and liberation at home and see letters from their families and villages. 2. The work of supporting the military has not been done well in some places. As a result, some soldiers' families have written to report difficulties in their family life, which affects the soldiers' morale. 3. After the news of meritorious service is sent to the rear, some local governments have not attached importance to congratulating the military families and mobilizing the masses to do so; some have not even sent it to the soldiers' homes. 4. Returning to the team is not regular. 5. The organization and education of civilian laborers participating in the war is poor, and some have poor discipline and do not listen to commands. The various rear organs attach great importance to these opinions and are now studying how to improve them.\n\nThe Third Special Commissioner’s Office, in light of the fact that the front-line troops are carrying out a commendation movement and the \"News of Meritorious Service\" is about to be sent back to the homes of meritorious personnel, specifically instructed all counties to clearly recognize that every \"News of Meritorious Service\" is exchanged by soldiers with boundless loyalty and bloody battles against the enemy. Therefore, they must assign certain cadres to personally deliver the news to the homes of the meritorious personnel and congratulate the families of the meritorious personnel; at the same time, they must earnestly mobilize the masses to congratulate the families of the meritorious personnel and convene mass congratulatory meetings to create an atmosphere of respect for military families and encourage the masses to actively join the army and participate in the war.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋绥慰问团在前线　征得对后方工作的宝贵意见\n\n1948-09-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋绥慰问团在前线\n  　征得对后方工作的宝贵意见\n    【新华社晋绥二十四日电】赴晋中前线慰问之晋绥“前线慰问团”及三专区（辖临县、离石、中阳、方山等县）人民慰问团，已于日前归来。慰问团在前方曾利用会议、漫谈及个别交谈等方式，征得前方将士对后方工作的许多宝贵意见。主要的有：一、前后方情况没有很好的沟通，战士们都希望了解家中分地翻身的情形，看到家里与本村的来信。二、优军工作有些地方没有做好，因此有的战士家属来信报告家庭生活困难，影响战士情绪。三、功臣喜报送到后方后，有的地方政府没有重视与发动群众给军属贺喜，有的甚至没有送到战士家中。四、归队工作不经常。五、参战民工组织教育差，有的纪律不好，不听指挥。各后方机关对这些意见极为重视，现正研究改进。\n    三专署以前方部队正在开展评功运动，“功臣喜报”即将送回功臣家中，特指示各县，明确认识每一张“功臣喜报”都是战士以无限忠诚浴血歼敌换来的，因此必须责成一定干部将喜报亲送功臣家中，向功臣家属致贺；同时，认真发动群众给功臣家属贺喜，召开群众祝贺大会，以造成尊重军属的风气，并鼓励群众积极参军参战。"

The city has a population of 700,000 and is situated at the junction of the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways. It is the largest city between Nanjing and Tianjin and plays a significant role in connecting China's north-south economy and culture. The city is divided into inner and outer cities. A commercial port was opened in the west of the city in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign (1904). Before the War of Resistance, commerce was quite prosperous. The urban area is lined with factories, and it is a major industrial city in Shandong along with Qingdao, with light and heavy industries such as flour, textiles, ironworks, papermaking, oil extraction, and leather making. The city has a well-developed education system and is the cultural center of Shandong Province, with four colleges and universities including the private Qilu University, the Provincial Medical College, the Normal College, and the Agricultural College, as well as twenty or thirty middle schools, with tens of thousands of students in the city. Jinan was the largest stronghold of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Shandong. The city was surrounded by three lines of permanent and strong defensive fortifications extending for dozens of miles, surrounded by numerous satellite strongholds, and defended by 100,000 heavily armed troops. However, in this offensive launched by the People's Liberation Army, the enemy's defense system completely collapsed after only eight days and nights of fighting, and the People's Liberation Army completely occupied the city. Jinan is the second provincial capital liberated by the People's Liberation Army in Guannei after Kaifeng. Its difference from Kaifeng is that it has been isolated in the encirclement of the liberated areas for a long time, so once it is liberated, it can be firmly owned by the people. After the liberation of Jinan, the Jinpu Railway, from Jinghai in the north to Lincheng north of Xuzhou in the south, is entirely controlled by the People's Liberation Army. The entire province of Shandong, with the exception of Qingdao, Yantai, and a few isolated strongholds in southern and southwestern Shandong, has been completely liberated. The two major liberated areas of Shandong and North China are also unobstructed.

Tens of thousands of PLA soldiers, along a front of over a hundred li, surged towards Jinan from all directions. On the eastern front, under the cover of artillery fire and tanks, our troops eliminated enemy resistance and rapidly captured enemy positions at Maoling Mountain, Yanchi Mountain, Zhongjingdian, Hancang, Guodian, and others. On the 17th, they captured strongholds at Xindian, Huilong Town, Dianliuzhuang, Yaotou, and others. On the 18th and 19th, our troops on this front continued to attack and advance, successively occupying Yanchi Mountain, Majiazhuang, Pingdingshan, Yinjiazhuang, and Hongjialou. On the 20th, they captured Huayuanzhuang, the sugar factory, Huangtai Mountain, Yiwang Bridge, and Yangtouyu, with their vanguard reaching the city of Jinan. In the above battles, portions of the enemy's 73rd Division and the 57th Brigade of the 83rd Division were annihilated. On the western front, our troops cleared out bandits south of Changqing city on the 15th, capturing over 700 alive; they then turned east and attacked in coordination with our eastern forces, capturing enemy strongholds such as Yangjiatai, Pipa Mountain, and Lijiazhuang east of Changqing on the same day. On the 17th, they continued their attack, occupying positions such as Fanhuitun, Silizhuang, Changqitun, Phoenix Mountain, and Renlizhuang, and successfully converged with our southern forces. On the same day, a unit of our troops on this front, in a brief 50-minute battle, completely annihilated a battalion of the Kuomintang Second Security District's Special Service Brigade and the puppet Changqing County Brigade, totaling over a thousand men, liberating Changqing County. On the 18th, they captured strongholds such as Boji Mountain, Damiaotun, Wangjiatun, and Zhao Jiazhuang, advancing towards Jinan step by step. On the 19th, they completely annihilated over a thousand enemy vanguards at Guanzhuang. At this time, the entire Kuomintang 84th Division and a battalion of the 8th Security Brigade victoriously staged a battlefield uprising. Our troops then rapidly occupied La Mountain, Duandian, the Army Barracks, and Yujiazhuang, directly pressing the edge of the western commercial district, and also occupied the airport, completely cutting off enemy air reinforcements. In the above battles, our troops on this front annihilated approximately one regiment of the enemy's 2nd Division. On the southern front, our troops occupied Yangshanyu and Shuang Shantou on the 16th, and the defending enemy fled in disarray. On the 17th and 18th, they occupied Zhangxia, Gu Mountain, Danga Zhuang, Dajian Gou, Jiashan Po, Kang Erzhuang and Shi Fang Yu, then victoriously joined forces with the western front troops, advancing in unison, and on the 19th occupied Qilishang, Baima Shan, Wangguan Zhuang, Jingjia Gou, Longke, and Xinglong Shan; thus from the south they attacked the edge of the commercial port. In the above battles, our army annihilated a portion of the enemy's Second Division, capturing one howitzer, and a total of four infantry guns and recoilless guns. On the northern front, our troops captured Qihe County on the evening of the 16th, and the defending enemy fled south across the river. On the same day, another unit of our troops occupied Beiluokou, Zaoyuan, and Xiaozhan. On the 17th, they reoccupied Queshanzhuang and Meihua Mountain. On the 19th, they crossed the Yellow River Iron Bridge, fiercely pursuing the fleeing enemy, and occupied Xincheng, Phoenix Mountain, and Nanluokou on the south bank of the Yellow River, attacking Jinan from the north. By this point, our troops on all four fronts had completed the close encirclement of the enemy defending Jinan city and the commercial district. In the above battles, the fighting style implemented by the People's Liberation Army was fierce attacks, fierce charges, fierce pursuits, and fierce advances, disrupting the enemy's deployment and not allowing the enemy the slightest chance to catch its breath, successfully completing the first stage of the liberation of Jinan campaign. From the launch of the offensive to the clearing of enemy outposts, it only took four days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 猛打猛冲猛追猛进　四面八方紧逼城垣　记者报导济南外围战役经过\n\n1948-09-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　猛打猛冲猛追猛进\n  　四面八方紧逼城垣\n  　记者报导济南外围战役经过\n    【新华社济南前线二十五日电】前线记者报导济南外围战经过称：十六日午夜十二时，即中秋节之前夕，人民解放军揭开了解放济南的伟大作战的序幕。千万个解放军健儿，沿百余里战线上，自四面八方直扑济南。东面我军在炮火与坦克掩护下，排除敌军的抵抗，迅速攻占茂岭山、砚池山、中井店、韩仓、郭店等敌军阵地。十七日复攻克辛店、回龙镇、甸柳庄、窑头等据点。十八、十九两日，该线我军继续攻击前进，先后占领燕翅山、马家庄、平顶山、尹家庄、洪家楼。二十日克花园庄、糖厂、黄台山、一王桥、羊头峪，前锋直抵济南城下。在上述战斗中，敌整七十三师、整八十三师的五七旅等部各被歼一部。西面我军并于十五日扫清长清城南土匪，生俘其七百余众；继即挥戈东进，与东面我军呼应攻击，当日攻占长清以东的杨家台、琵琶山、李家庄等据点。十七日继续攻击，占领藩槐屯、四里庄、常旗屯、凤凰山、仁里庄等阵地，与南面我军胜利会师。同日，该线我军一部，以五十分钟的短促战斗，全歼国民党二绥区特务旅之一个营及伪长清县大队共千余人，解放长清县城。十八日攻占簸箕山、大庙屯、王家屯、赵家庄等据点，步步打向济南。十九日全歼敌先锋总队千余于官庄，此时国民党整八十四师全部及保八旅的一个营，胜利举行战场起义，我军乃迅速占领蜡山、段店、陆军营房、余家庄，直逼市西商埠边沿，并占领飞机场，使敌军空中增援完全告绝。该线我军在上述战斗中，共歼敌整二师约一个团兵力。南面我军十六日占羊山峪、双山头，守敌望风而逃。十七、十八两日占张夏、崮山、党家庄、大涧沟、甲山坡、康尔庄、石方峪，即与西面我军胜利会师，齐头并进，于十九日攻占七里山、白马山、王官庄、井家沟、龙窠、兴隆山；至此，乃由南面攻抵商埠边沿。在上述战斗中，我军歼敌整二师一部，缴获榴弹炮一门，步兵炮及平射炮共四门。北面我军于十六日晚夺取齐河县城，守敌渡河南窜，同日我军另部攻占北泺口、枣园、小站，十七日复占鹊山庄、梅花山，十九日越过黄河铁桥猛追逃敌，攻占黄河南岸的新城、凤凰山、南泺口等地，由北面攻向济南。至此，四面我军乃完成了对济南城及商埠守敌的紧密包围。在上述战斗中，解放军所实现的战斗作风是猛打猛冲，猛追猛进，打乱敌人布署，不使敌人获得丝毫喘息机会，胜利地完成了解放济南战役的第一阶段。从发起攻势到扫清敌外围据点，仅用去四天时间。"

According to statistics from our Changchun Frontline Command: From June 25th to September 5th, in the two months and ten days, the besieging forces have taken in a total of 13,000 people, accounting for more than one-tenth of the enemy's total force. This includes more than 8,800 soldiers from the enemy's regular army, the New 7th Army and the 60th Army. According to incomplete statistics, there are a total of 298 officers at the rank of Major and Captain; among them, Luo Zhenya, a Major and Deputy Battalion Commander of the 60th Army, and Cai Songpo, a Captain and Company Commander of the Temporary 52nd Division, surrendered with their weapons. Collective surrenders with weapons include the Cavalry Security Brigade and other units, totaling 259 people. In total, the surrendering soldiers brought with them 4 60mm mortars, 1 rifle grenade launcher, 30 light machine guns, 49 submachine guns, 2 signal guns, a total of 1,364 rifles and other guns, more than 60,000 rounds of various ammunition, 1 radio, 4 telephones, 21 binoculars, and 8 warhorses.\n\nWhen these surrendering Kuomintang officers and soldiers crossed the firing line, the People's Liberation Army provided cover and repelled enemy pursuers, ensuring their safe arrival at the People's Liberation Army positions. They all believe that the sentry line, only 100 meters apart, is a boundary between life and death; staying on the other side means certain death, and escaping to this side means happiness and a bright future.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 25th: On the 18th and 19th, two companies of the enemy besieged in Changchun collectively surrendered. On the 18th, Lu Fengwu, the Company Commander of the 2nd Regiment of the enemy's Jilin Security Brigade, led 24 men to surrender to our army. The next day, Qi Fengfa, the Company Commander of the enemy's Cavalry Brigade, led 55 men to surrender. The two companies brought with them a total of 70 rifles and other guns, 9 submachine guns, 2 light machine guns, and 1 60mm mortar.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northeast, September 26th: The Changchun Frontline Command of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a stern warning to the enemy garrisoning Changchun: if they do not immediately cease their large-scale destructive actions against Changchun, the People's Liberation Army will severely punish them separately after the liberation of Changchun. The Kuomintang bandit army, facing extinction, is now frantically demolishing houses. Thousands of buildings surrounding the suburbs of Changchun have been completely destroyed, and now the demolition has reached the central area. All beams, rafters, doors, windows, tables, chairs, furniture, etc., have been looted for firewood. Large numbers of Kuomintang bandit troops are dispatched every day, driving away residents on one hand and climbing onto roofs to demolish buildings on the other. The entire city is filled with dust, appearing a hazy yellow from a distance. Part of the Changchun University dormitory has also been demolished, and all books and instruments have been looted and sold by the bandits; the well-equipped instruments and equipment of the medical school have been completely stolen. All factories have been turned into barracks; most of the machinery has been damaged, stolen, or used for defensive fortifications. Scattered machine parts can now be picked up near every factory site. The machinery and wiring of the large substation in the east of the city are in disarray and beyond repair. All public facilities in the city, such as water pipes, heating pipes, and electrical wires, have also been largely destroyed for use in bunker construction. Only a few of the power poles in the city remain, except for the iron ones. The transformers on the poles have been smashed, and the insulating oil inside has been taken to clean guns. The beautiful trees on the major streets of Changchun have been mostly cut down, leaving only rows of stumps. The bandit troops even dig up the asphalt and coal slag on the asphalt roads for fuel. This desperate destructive behavior of the enemy garrisoning Changchun has aroused unprecedented resentment among the people of the city.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 长春国民党军官兵纷纷逃出死城　两个月万余人向我投诚  我军警告长春守敌停止疯狂破坏\n\n1948-09-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　长春国民党军官兵纷纷逃出死城\n  　两个月万余人向我投诚\n    我军警告长春守敌停止疯狂破坏\n    【新华社东北二十四日电】困守长春的国民党军官兵，纷纷逃出死城向解放军投诚。据我长春前线指挥部统计：自六月二十五日至九月五日的两个月零十天中，围城部队共已收容一万三千人，达守敌总兵力的十分之一以上。其中包括敌正规军新七军、六十军所部共八千八百余名。据不完全统计，共有校尉级军官二百九十八名；其中六十军少校团副罗震亚、暂五十二师上尉连长蔡松坡等多人皆系携械投诚者。集体携械投诚的，有骑兵保安旅等部共二百五十九名。总计投诚者共携来六零炮四门，枪榴筒一具，轻机枪三十挺，冲锋式四十九支，信号枪二支，长短枪等共一千三百六十四支，各种弹药六万余发，电台一架，电话机四架，望远镜二十一个，军马八匹。\n    这些投诚的国民党军官兵逃越火线时，解放军都予以接应，击退敌人追兵，使他们安全到达解放军阵地。他们都认为相距仅一百米的步哨线，就是一条生死界，留在那边便是死路，逃过来就是幸福和光明大道。\n    【新华社东北二十五日电】十八、十九两日长春被围之敌，两连集体投诚。十八日敌吉林保安旅二团一连连长卢凤武率部二十四人归降我军。次日，敌骑兵旅连长齐风发又率部五十五人来归。两连共携来长短枪七十支，冲锋式九支，轻机枪两挺，六零炮一门。\n    【新华社东北廿六日电】解放军长春前线指挥部，顷对长春守敌发出严厉警告，如不立即停止对长春的大规模的破坏行动，则解放军于解放长春之后，决分别予以严厉惩处。面临灭亡的国民党匪军现正疯狂地拆房，围绕长春市郊的成千幢楼房，已被拆毁殆尽，现并已拆到中心区。所有梁椽、门窗、桌椅、家具等全部被抢去作了烧柴。每日国民党匪军大批出动，一面驱逐居民，一面就架梯子上房。全市尘土冲天，远望一片昏黄。长春大学宿舍一部亦已被拆除，图书仪器全部为匪劫卖；设备完善的医学院的仪器器材，被盗窃一空。所有工厂都作了兵营；机器大都被损被盗或作了防御工事。每一厂址附近，现都可拾到散落的机器零件。城东大变压所机器、线架东倒西歪，不可收拾。市内各公共设备，如自来水管、暖气管、电线等也大部被毁作地堡工事，全城电线杆除铁的以外，已所剩无几。电杆上之变压器都被砸毁，其中之绝缘油被拿去擦枪。长春各大街上美丽的树木，绝大部分均被砍去，只剩下一排一排的树桩。匪军甚至把柏油马路上的沥青和煤屑掘起来当燃料。长春守敌的这种绝望的破坏行为，已引起该市人民的空前愤恨。"

    "title": "Severe Livestock Deaths in Yangqu, Huolu, and Other Areas; Some Regions Implement Rewards for Livestock Raising",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-27",
    "page_number": "1",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, North China, 24th—Livestock deaths are quite serious in some areas of North China. The governments of these areas are taking various measures to encourage livestock raising to remedy the situation. Since this spring, some areas, during land reform, confiscated surplus livestock from landlords and rich peasants and adopted unreasonable methods of distributing livestock in proportion to land acreage. For example, in Beichima Village, Huolu, five or more households had to share a mule; in some villages in Yangqu, nine households had to share an ox. Moreover, the households sharing livestock were not always voluntarily organized. Some stipulations required feeding each animal two jin of grain and fifteen jin of grass per day, which became unaffordable over time, causing the livestock to become sick. Because livestock was shared, work that people could do was also assigned to the animals, leading to a backlog of work for each household and exhaustion for the animals. Some were even used without being fed adequately, leading to their eventual death from exhaustion. In Dongguan, the urban area of Huolu, nine livestock acquired as fruits of land reform were not distributed and were cared for by hired laborers employed by the farmers' association. Due to poor care, four of them died. In some areas, the interests of middle peasants were infringed upon in the organization of production mutual aid. For example, in Xiaoyudi Village, Huolu, cadres forced the masses to form twenty-eight large mutual aid groups, stipulating the exchange of labor and animal power. Members' livestock was used on average; poor peasants (referring to those who were poor before land reform, who, although they had received land, often still lacked livestock) did work for middle peasants, while middle peasants allowed poor peasants to use their livestock. However, because middle peasants generally had little need for poor peasants to do work for them, it effectively became the middle peasants helping the poor peasants with their livestock. Moreover, some poor peasants used the middle peasants' livestock, but did not feed them after use and sent them back, causing many animals to become exhausted and sick. In terms of wartime service burdens, there were also instances of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. For example, in many villages in Yangqu, it was stipulated that households with livestock would bear wartime service burdens, while those without livestock would not. Those with good livestock would bear more burdens, and those with poor livestock would bear fewer burdens. In addition, accounts were not carefully settled, resulting in unfair burdens, causing some farmers to not cherish or be unwilling to raise livestock. Due to these reasons, coupled with natural disasters, over 200 livestock have died in Huolu since March this year. In Yangqu, about 200 livestock have been reduced this year due to illness and exhaustion (overexertion, temporary inability to use), and in Renqiu First District, 48 livestock have died since the Lunar New Year, greatly affecting production.\n\nTo protect livestock, the Jinnan Administrative Office has stipulated that breeding stock, pregnant stock (two months before and one month after birth), young stock with one pair of teeth, and livestock purchased less than three months ago are exempt from corvée labor. It encourages public and private collective breeding of livestock. County and city governments purchase breeding bulls and donkeys, advance feed, and entrust reliable farmers to feed and breed them. Those who continuously raise them for two years will have the breeding stock become the property of the feeding household. In addition, it encourages the transport of livestock and promotes the prevention and treatment of animal diseases. The Yangqu County Government, in addition to determining improved methods for wartime service burdens and rewarding livestock raising, particularly emphasized the proper handling of livestock ownership. To this end, it clearly announced: whether livestock is purchased with loans, acquired as fruits of land reform, or received as relief, whoever is given it owns it and cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn or exchanged. If there are too many households sharing livestock, and the livestock is not well fed, and the masses are willing to have one or two households raise them, they can be valued according to the opinions of the masses. The households willing to raise them can compensate the remaining households sharing the livestock at the assessed price, and the livestock will be definitively owned by the household that paid the price.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 阳曲、获鹿等地　牲畜死亡现象严重　有的地区实行奖励喂养牲畜\n\n1948-09-27\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　阳曲、获鹿等地\n  　牲畜死亡现象严重\n  　有的地区实行奖励喂养牲畜\n    【新华社华北二十四日电】华北部分地区牲畜死亡现象相当严重，各该地区政府正采取种种奖励喂养牲畜的办法，以资挽救。今春以来，某些地区在土地改革中没收地主和征收富农多余的牲口，采取了按照地亩数量伙分牲口的不合理的办法。如获鹿北郗马村五户以上才伙分到一头骡子，阳曲有些村子九户才能伙分到一头牛；而这些伙分牲口的各户又不完全是自愿组成的。伙喂时有的规定牲口喂一天用二斤料十五斤草，日久喂不起，牲口都病了。因为伙分了牲口，人能干的活也留给牲口，各户积活很多，牲口太累，有的甚至光使不喂，慢慢就累死了。获鹿城区东关有九头土改果实的牲口没有分配，由农会雇长工喂着，因照顾不好便死了四头。有些地区，在组织生产互助上侵犯了中农利益。如获鹿小于底村干部强迫群众组成二十八个大互助组，规定人力畜力变工，组员的牲口平均使用，贫农（指土地改革前的贫农，他们虽已分得土地，但多仍缺乏牲口）给中农做活，中农让贫农使牲口。但因一般中农很少用得着贫农做活，实际上成了中农用牲口帮助了贫农；更有些贫农用的中农牲口却是用完不喂就送回去，因而牲口累坏了很多。在战勤负担方面，也有侵犯中农利益的现象，如阳曲不少村庄规定有牲口的负担战勤，没有牲口的不负担，牲口好的多负担，牲口不好的少负担，又不认真结算帐目，因此负担不公，使部分农民不爱护或不愿喂牲口。由于这些原因，加上天灾等原因，获鹿自今年三月以来，牲畜死亡在二百头以上，阳曲今年因病、乏（劳动过度，一时不能使用）减少牲畜约二百头，任邱一区从旧历新年到现在，已死亡牲畜四十八头，影响生产很大。\n    为了保护牲畜，冀南行署已规定种畜、孕畜（产前两月，产后一月）、一对牙的儿畜及购进不满三个月的牲畜免除差役。奖励公私伙养种畜，由县市政府购买种牛种驴，预借饲料委托可靠农户喂养交配；连续喂养二年者，种畜即归喂养户所有。此外并奖励贩运牲口，推广畜病的预防与治疗方法。阳曲县政府除确定改进战勤负担办法和奖励喂养牲畜外，特别强调妥善处理牲畜的所有权，为此明确宣布：不论是贷款购买、土改果实或救济的牲口，给了谁就是谁的，不得任意抽换；凡伙分牲口户数太多，牲口没有喂好，群众愿意给一家或两家喂养者，可根据群众意见作价，由愿喂养户按价偿还其余伙分牲口的各户，牲口即确定归出价户所有。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, September 22nd.\n\nThe Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region New Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee recently issued instructions that mobilizing young people to actively participate in the autumn and winter work of land adjustment, determination of land rights, rectification of rural branches, and autumn and winter production, and establishing and improving youth work in these tasks, is the main task of the region's current youth work. The instructions of the committee include the following three aspects:\n\n    First, in the adjustment of land, the issuance of land certificates, and the development of rural democratic movements, it is necessary to break the old method of limiting the target of mass work only to parents, and to promote the advantages of young people's simplicity, straightforwardness, courage to reflect the true situation, and courage to put forward opinions to others. They should be absorbed to participate in land registration, writing calculations, and other work. In organizing winter production and preparing for next year's spring plowing, all young people and children should be mobilized to participate in manure accumulation, fuel preparation, and various sideline productions within their capabilities, in order to facilitate the upsurge of the entire rural production movement. Where conditions permit, night schools, literacy groups, reading groups, etc. should be organized as much as possible during leisure time to improve the culture of young people and children and promote healthy recreational activities. In these activities, they should be organized according to the various forms they are willing to take, their ideological awareness should be raised, and activists should be cultivated to lay a better foundation for future youth work.\n\n    Second, in areas where the Youth League has been established, League members should first be mobilized to play an exemplary role in doing a good job in mobilizing the youth; at the same time, in view of the fact that the majority of local League branches are not yet sound, they should be rectified in coordination with the Party rectification movement. The methods are: 1. Replenish the necessary number of district and county-level youth work cadres, give them specific help, and improve their work ability. 2. Improve the League branch committee, elect good League members to the committee; recruit a group of new League members from among the new youth activists; educate and transform some League members with poor conditions or bad work styles. 3. Coordinate with the current central work and, according to the demands of the youth, establish regular work activities for the Youth League. In the work of establishing the League, it is necessary to base it on the youth's consciousness and voluntariness, prevent forced orders and formalism such as copying rosters; and it is necessary to focus on and plan to select areas with relatively dense populations and more young people to establish the League.\n\n    Third, in the autumn and winter land adjustment and other work, youth cadres must obey the unified allocation of the Party and closely combine with the entire work steps of the local Party to avoid being out of touch with the entire work activities. To this end, it is recommended that Party committees at all levels strengthen their leadership over youth work and help district or county youth cadres formulate specific work plans and implementation steps and methods for improving the Youth League; youth cadres should be used as centrally as possible to facilitate doing a good job in typical districts and townships, summarizing experience, and promoting general work.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 陕甘宁新青团筹委会指示　发动青年参加秋冬工作\n\n1948-09-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　陕甘宁新青团筹委会指示\n  　发动青年参加秋冬工作\n    【新华社西北二十二日电】发动青年群众积极参加秋冬两季之调剂土地、确定地权、整顿农村支部及进行秋冬生产等工作，并在这些工作中建立和健全青年工作，这是最近陕甘宁边区新民主主义青年团筹委会所指示的该区目前青年工作的主要任务。该会的指示包括以下三个方面：\n    一、在调剂土地、发土地证及开展农村民主运动中，必须打破过去不少地区把群众工作对象只限于家长的旧办法，发扬青年纯朴直爽，勇于反映真实情况和勇于向别人提出意见的优点，吸收他们参加登记土地写算等工作。在组织冬季生产和准备明年春耕工作上，应发动所有青年儿童参加积肥和准备燃料以及各种力所能及的副业生产，以有利于掀起整个农村生产运动的热潮。在条件许可的地方，还要尽可能利用闲暇时间，组织夜校、识字组、读报组等，提高青年、儿童的文化，提倡正当的娱乐活动。在这些活动中，依据他们所愿意采取的各种形式组织起来，提高其思想觉悟，培养积极分子，给今后青年工作打下更好的基础。\n    二、在已建立青年团的地区应首先发动团员起模范带头作用，做好发动青年群众的工作；同时鉴于大多数地方团的支部尚不健全，应在配合整党运动中予以整顿。办法是：一、充实必要数量的分区和县级青年工作干部，级予具体帮助，提高其工作能力。二、健全团的支部委员会，选举好的团员到委员会中去；在新的青年积极分子中吸收一批新团员；教育改造一些条件较差或作风不好的团员。三、配合当前中心工作，并依据青年群众的要求，建立起青年团的经常工作活动。在建团工作中，必须根据青年的自觉自愿，防止抄名册等强迫命令和形式主义；要有重点、有计划的选择人口比较稠密，青年较多的地区建立。\n    三、在秋冬两季调剂土地等工作中，青年干部必须服从党的统一分配，与当地党的整个工作步骤密切结合，避免与整个工作活动脱节。为此建议各地党委加强对青年工作的领导，并帮助分区或县的青年干部，制订改善青年团的具体工作计划和实行的步骤、方法；尽可能比较集中地使用青年干部，以便于能做好典型区、乡，总结经验，推动一般。"

    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-27",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Electric\n\n　　At the end of last year, Su Zhi, who was responsible for the work in a certain area of Xifu, deeply felt the difficulty of operating in enemy-occupied areas without armed forces. He sought and obtained approval from his superiors, and together with Zhao Yanfang, who had connections and prestige among the local people, actively planned to establish a guerrilla force.\n\n　　When the guerrilla force was first established, there were only three people: Su Zhi, Zhao Yanfang, and a communications员 Su San De. However, on the day of its establishment, they held a grand ceremony, slaughtered a pig, and invited farmers from both sides of the Jing River to explain the purpose of building an army for the people. Su Zhi also used the example of Commander He's uprising with a kitchen knife to illustrate the greatness of the people's power and the bright prospects for development. The fame of \"Zhao Yanfang's establishment of a guerrilla force\" spread, and soon three hired laborers, unable to bear the oppression of the Kuomintang government's forced grain and conscription, ran away to join. Seven or eight young people from the Changning town area, fleeing the extortion and harassment of the local tyrant Lü Shisan, also ran to the guerrilla force; two of them automatically joined. Zhao Yanfang also invited three hired laborers who could not make a living to join. Then, a demobilized soldier of the People's Liberation Army, unable to stay at home, also invited four or five farmers to come; in addition, seven or eight farmers who had benefited from land reform voluntarily joined. By April of this year, the entire team had grown to thirty-five people. Thus, the \"Ningtai Guerrilla Force\" was officially formed, with Zhao Yanfang as the captain, Yang Guangyao as the instructor, and under the direct leadership of Su Zhi, to carry out the struggle against the enemy. When the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the Jingwei River Valley in April of this year, a large number of farmers poured into the guerrilla force, and the team expanded even more rapidly.\n\n　　After the guerrilla force was established, Su, Zhao, and Yang first taught the members the song of \"Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention,\" and explained them item by item, so that everyone deeply understood the discipline of the people's armed forces. In addition, they often explained to the members Chairman Mao's report \"The Present Situation and Our Tasks,\" \"How to Be a Good Communist,\" \"Manifesto and Slogans of the Chinese People's Liberation Army\" and other documents and news of victories, and launched discussions. Once, after reading a newspaper article on the \"Malan Guerrilla Force,\" the members said: \"We must catch up with them!\" In order to make everyone remember the issues that should be observed and paid attention to, they posted notes in the accommodation places with sayings such as \"Never beat or scold people, persuade people slowly with reason.\" Everyone also frequently struggled against erroneous behaviors and thoughts, such as a squad leader with a very bad character, who everyone was dissatisfied with. After repeated education, he did not change, and was finally purged. A member who failed to turn over captured items to the public, a member who killed a dog to eat, and a member who stole things were all corrected after timely education by everyone. A simple summary of each day's life was made during roll call in the evening, so that everyone was often vigilant and followed the rules. A squad meeting was also held once a week to encourage everyone to make suggestions to the leading comrades to improve leadership. From the beginning of its establishment, the team also paid attention to the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people. Whenever they went, they took advantage of the gaps to chop firewood, hoe wheat, weed, build pig pens, and carry water for the masses; and organized discipline inspection teams to strictly prohibit entering civilian houses, chatting with women, and borrowing things at will. They also paid attention to cultural learning, and checked learning results every week. For example, a squad leader who was originally illiterate can now copy the names of the team members. They paid great attention to party member education, established the core leadership of the party, held party lessons once a week, and required party members to play a leading role in every task. Model party members such as squad leader Wang Sifu and squad leader Liu Yanxi emerged. Through the above-mentioned education, the political awareness of the members was greatly improved, and they began to develop the habit of contacting the masses, observing discipline, and obeying command. The troops became increasingly consolidated as they expanded, and there has never been a desertion since the establishment of the troops.\n\n　　Due to the purity of the team's composition, high political awareness, and extremely strong morale, they have achieved great results in more than half a year of struggle against the enemy. Before the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the Jingwei River Valley, they crossed the Jing River and operated in the enemy area more than 30 times, supporting local work, destroying enemy bunkers and fortifications, and attacking the enemy. When the People's Liberation Army launched an attack, they actively cooperated in combat, and successively captured more than 200 machine guns and rifles, more than 10,000 bullets, and more than 1,000 grenades. After the main force was transferred, they continued to persist in guerrilla warfare in their original locations, covering local work. When the enemy invaded Guanzhong in August, a part of the team crossed the Jing River again and inserted into the Yongshou area. In one month, they repelled more than ten enemy invasions. On the evening of August 10, they destroyed two enemy military trucks on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway and captured eight enemies. They seized five tons of Qinghai salt and immediately distributed it to the local people. On the 11th and 12th, more than 380 members of the enemy Qian County and Yongshou \"Self-Defense Forces\" attempted to retaliate and sneaked into Changning town. They immediately went to meet the enemy and repelled them, killing or wounding 16 enemy soldiers including the company commander and below, and helped the people recover two stolen mules. The team only suffered one minor injury. Because they resolutely fought to protect the interests of the people, the local people automatically collected more than 2,000 bullets and some weapons and sent them to them, helped them deliver food, scouted for information, and 40 farmers and students voluntarily came to join the team, further expanding the troops.\n\n　　In this way, this guerrilla force has been rapidly tempered into a strong force with good equipment, bravery in combat, ability to contact the masses, observe discipline, and obey command.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 顽强活动于泾水两岸敌后的宁泰游击队\n\n1948-09-27\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　顽强活动于泾水两岸敌后的宁泰游击队\n    去年年底，负责西府某地区工作的苏智，深感在敌占区活动没有武装的困难，就呈准上级，和在当地群众中有联系有威信的赵彦芳一起，积极筹划成立游击队。\n    游击队开始成立时就只有苏智、赵彦芳和通讯员苏三德三个人。但成立那天，他们举行了隆重的仪式，杀猪请了泾河两岸的农民，说明为人民建军的目的。苏智并以贺司令员一把菜刀起义的例子，说明人民力量的伟大和发展前途的光明。“赵彦芳成立游击队”的声名传开了，不久就有三个雇工不堪国民党政府逼粮逼丁的压迫跑来参加。常宁镇一带有七、八个青年躲避恶霸吕十三的敲榨骚扰，也跑到游击队来；其中两人就自动参加了。赵彦芳又约了三个生活无法维持的雇工来参加。接着，一个解放军退伍军人因家里站不住也约了四、五个农民前来；另外又有得土地改革利益的七、八个农民自动参加。到今年四月，全队就发展到了三十五人。于是正式组成“宁泰游击队”，赵彦芳为队长，杨光耀为指导员，在苏智直接领导下进行对敌斗争。当今年四月解放军出击泾渭河谷时，大批农民涌进游击队，队伍更迅速扩大了。\n    游击队成立后，苏、赵、杨首先教会队员“三大纪律、八项注意”歌，并逐条讲解，使每个人都深刻了解人民武装的纪律。此外，经常给队员讲解毛主席“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告、“怎样做一个共产党员”、“人民解放军宣言和口号”等文件和胜利消息，并发动讨论。有一次读了报上一篇“马栏游击队”，队员们就说：“我们一定要赶上它！”为了使大家记住应遵守和注意的问题，就在住宿地贴了“千万不要打人骂人，用道理慢慢说服人”等字条。大家并经常对错误的行为和思想进行斗争，如有一个班长，品质很坏，大家不满，经屡次教育不改，最后就清洗了。有个队员缴获不归公，有个队员杀狗吃，有个队员偷东西，都经大家及时教育后改正了。每天的生活都在晚间点名时作一简单总结，使大家经常有所警惕和遵循。每星期并开班务会一次，发动大家对领导同志提意见以改进领导。该队从成立开始也就注意了拥政爱民工作，每到一处就利用空隙替群众砍柴、锄麦、锄草、起圈、担水；并组织纪律检查组，严禁随便进民房，随便和妇女闲谈，随便借东西等。他们对文化学习也很注意，每周检查学习成绩，如原来不识字的一个分队长，现在已能抄下队员的名单。他们很注意党员教育，建立党的核心领导，每星期上党课一次，要求党员们在每件工作上都起带头作用，涌现了分队长王思富、班长刘彦秀等模范党员。经过上述种种教育，大大提高了队员的政治觉悟，开始养成了联系群众、遵守纪律、服从指挥的习惯。部队随着扩大而日益巩固，从部队成立到现在，始终没有发生逃亡现象。\n    由于该队成份纯洁，政治觉悟高，士气极为旺盛。在半年多的对敌斗争中获得很大战绩。解放军出击泾渭流域前，他们就曾渡过泾水，到敌区活动三十多次，拥护地方工作，摧毁敌碉堡工事，袭击敌人。解放军出击时，他们积极配合作战，先后缴获机枪、步枪等二百多枝，子弹万多发，手榴弹千余枚。主力转移后，他们仍坚持原地游击战争，掩护地方工作。八月敌犯关中时，该队一部又渡过泾水，插到永寿地区。一月之间曾击退了进犯敌十余次。八月十日晚他们在西兰公路上毁敌军用大卡车二辆，俘敌八名。缴获青海盐五吨，当即散给了当地群众。十一、十二日，敌乾县、永寿“自卫队”三百八十余名企图报复，窜抵常宁镇，他们立即前往迎战，将敌击退。毙伤敌中队长以下十六人，并替老百姓夺回了被抢的骡子两头，该队仅轻伤一人。由于他们坚决作战保护人民利益，当地人民自动搜集了子弹二千多发和武器一部送给他们，帮助他们送饭，探消息，并有四十个农民和学生自动前来参加了该队，使部队进一步扩大了。\n    这支游击队就是这样迅速地从斗争中锻炼成了装备优良、英勇善战、能联系群众、遵守纪律、服从指挥的坚强力量。（新华社西北电）"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 21st -- Farmers in the Jin-Sui liberated areas are purchasing large numbers of livestock in preparation for winter production and next year's large-scale production, as the government issues land certificates and confirms land rights. In recent months, Hequ County has imported over 1,000 head of livestock from Mongolia, and imports are continuing steadily. In the past three months, Xinjiang County in southern Shanxi has also purchased over 1,000 head of livestock. The county also lent 1,000 dan of grain and converted the gold and silver from the fruits of struggle in various places into cash, which was then lent by the farmers' association to farmers lacking livestock to help them purchase livestock.\n    In order to protect and encourage the increase of livestock, all areas are now strictly enforcing the Border Region Administrative Office's order to protect cattle. Aiming at farmers' concerns that cattle rights are not consolidated, the Yanbei Fifth District decided to determine cattle rights and issue cattle certificates at the same time as determining land rights. During the spring plowing season, Shuoxian County transferred cattle shares and issued unequal immediate exchange, and even free use rights, resulting in farmers being unwilling to feed livestock. Therefore, the county recently instructed all villages to resolutely supplement cattle prices and implement the principle of voluntary and equivalent exchange during autumn plowing.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th -- Rural areas in the Northeast liberated areas are widely developing sideline production. In Tailai County, Nenjiang Province, due to the influence of land evaluation and land allocation, farmers have dispelled concerns about land rights and production, and are more actively engaged in sideline production. Farmers in five districts of the county have collected 93.5 million catties of firewood and grass. In addition to exchanging it for millet and bean cake, they have also bought horses and carts. Dayushu Village alone bought 34 horses and 52 carts. The masses in the Sanchahe District of Fuyu earned 870 million yuan from collecting grass and weaving baskets, and have now bought back 675,900 catties of grain. Farmers in five districts, including Mao'ershan in Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, earned over 90 million yuan from pulling planks, making axe handles, and women's spinning and weaving in 20 days, solving the problem of food and winter clothing during the lean season, and bought 121 horses.

    "content": "Editor's Note: The problem reflected here is not only a lack of attention to leading production but also reflects a lack of means and understanding of the purpose of leading production and how to lead it. Therefore, \"attention\" must be combined with finding solutions and clarifying the purpose. County leaders should strengthen the inspection and supervision of district cadres and help them come up with ideas; otherwise, simply blaming them will not work.\n\n[JiZhong Electric] At the enlarged meeting of county and district cadres held by the Wu Ji County Party Committee on September 5th, where 150 people attended, an inspection of production revealed a serious phenomenon of widespread neglect of leadership in autumn harvesting and wheat planting. According to reports from all nine districts in the county, except for the sixth and eighth districts, which had relatively good leadership in production, other districts had relaxed their leadership. For example, the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth districts only briefly reported that there were two or three mutual aid teams and militia jointly guarding the crops, but when asked how the mutual aid teams were formed and how the district cadres led them, the answer was \"I don't know.\" When the fifth district reported, it was heard that a lazy landlord in Bei Wang Village was stealing crops, and the militia restricted him. The landlord said, \"Are you not going to let me eat!\" When further asked how the district handled it, the district cadre again did not know. When the cadres of the fourth district participated in production meetings, they reported the same few mutual aid teams organized in Ma Qiao Village since 1932, but they did not know what new experiences and developments there were. None of the districts had discovered what difficulties and concerns the masses had regarding autumn harvesting and wheat planting, and they only reported the production situation based on the village cadres' reports. The next day, County Party Secretary Zhang Yu conveyed the work for September and October, and on the third day, group discussions began, and they conducted self-criticism. From the self-criticism, it was found that the district cadres' laissez-faire attitude towards production leadership was extremely serious, and many erroneous understandings existed. For example, Gu Jie, the secretary of the Fifth District Party Committee, said: \"I used to think that production work was not the business of district cadres, but the work of the Promotion Cooperative, the Industry and Commerce Section, and the stores. They have solutions. If the masses are not organized, the Promotion Cooperative will not lend them money. What can district cadres do?\" Zhang Zhonghai, the captain of the Eighth District, said: \"I think production work is not as important as supporting the front, collecting taxes, and expanding the army. Those tasks have numbers, and after completion, they are published in the circular. Production work has no edge (meaning no clear standard).\" Liu Rongxin, the women's committee member of the Seventh District, said: \"I don't even know when to plant what, how can I lead the masses! It's the same every year.\" Zhu Yuanxin, the military training section chief of the County Armed Forces Department, said: \"I have no confidence in getting organized. I've been doing it for several years, and which year has it been done well?\" A comrade in the Second District even thought that production work was not revolutionary work. Among the seven cadres participating in the meeting in the First District, five underestimated women's production. Finally, the County Party Committee criticized and educated them based on the above ideas of neglecting production, pointing out that the Party and government organs in each district must attach great importance to production leadership. The central task for September and October should be leading the autumn harvest and wheat planting.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 一问三不知　无极区干不摸生产\n\n1948-09-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　一问三不知\n  　无极区干不摸生产\n    编者按：这里反映的问题，不仅是对领导生产不重视，而且反映了没办法，不知道领导生产的目的和如何领导。所以“重视”必须和想办法、明确目的性相结合。县领导上应加强对区干的检查督促，帮助他们出主意，否则光责备是不行的。\n    【冀中电】无极县委在九月五日召开的百五十人的县区干部扩大会上，检查生产，发现普遍忽视秋收种麦领导的严重现象。据全县九个区的报告，除六、八区对生产领导较好外，其他各区都放松了领导。如一、二、三、四、五区，只简单报告了那里有三两个互助组和民兵联防看庄稼，可是一追问互助组是怎么搞起来的？区干部怎么领导的？回答是“不知道。”五区报告时听说北汪村有一个好吃懒做的地主偷庄稼，民兵限制他，地主说：“该不叫吃饭啊！”又一追问区里怎样处理的？该区干部又不知道。四区干部每逢参加生产会议时都将马桥村自民国三十二年就组织起来的几个互助组报告一次，究竟有哪些新的经验和发展，也不知道。各区都没有发现群众对秋收种麦有哪些困难和顾虑，仅是根据村干部反映的生产情况，报告了一下。第二天县委书记张玉传达了九、十月份的工作，第三天开始分组讨论，并对照自己进行检讨。从检讨中发现各区干部对生产领导的自流观点极为严重，并存在很多错误认识。如五区区委秘书谷杰说：“我已往认为生产工作不是区干部的事，是推进社、实业科、商店的工作，他们有办法，群众不组织起来，推进社不贷给他们款，区干部有什么办法呢？”八区大队长张中海说：“我认为生产工作不如支前、征收、扩军重要，那些工作有个数字，完成后通报上登一登，生产工作没有边缘（意即没明确标准）。”七区妇委刘荣欣说：“我自己还不知道什么时候种什么好呢，怎么领导群众！年年这一套。”县武装部军训股长朱元信说：“我对组织起来没有信心，过去弄了好几年，哪年弄好了呢？”二区一个同志，竟认为生产工作不是革命工作。一区参加会的七个干部，就有五个轻视妇女生产的。最后县委根据以上轻视生产的思想，进行了批评和教育。指出各区党政机关必须高度重视生产领导。九、十月份应以领导秋收种麦为中心工作。"

They also recounted the inhuman suffering endured by the people of Northeast China during the 14 years of Japanese occupation. They pointed out that only the Communist Party members stood with the people of Northeast China in their struggle at that time, and only the Soviet Union spoke out righteously in the international arena, condemning Japan's aggression and ultimately helping to liberate Northeast China with its powerful Red Army.\n\n　　Vice Chairman Gao, in his article \"If the Chiang Kai-shek Gang Doesn't Die, the National Crisis Won't End,\" concluded: \"After August 15th, Chiang Kai-shek's only intention was to replace Japan with U.S. imperialism, turning China into a colony of U.S. imperialism, while he himself would replace Puyi and Wang Jingwei.\" He called on the people of Northeast China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to vigorously support the Liberation War, completely destroy the reactionary ruling structure of the Kuomintang gang, and establish a New Democratic Coalition Government.\n\n　　Chairman Feng Zhongyun, formerly a leader of the Anti-Japanese United Army, said in his article \"Recalling the Tragic Fourteen Years\": For fourteen years, Northeast China was like a giant labor camp, prison, and execution ground. Tens of thousands of people from Northeast China were captured and massacred after being forced to build fortifications for the Japanese invaders. To deal with the Anti-Japanese United Army, the Japanese invaders adopted the \"three alls\" policy (kill all, burn all, loot all), consolidated villages, and established so-called \"collective settlements.\" He said: Even now, various instruments of torture and remnants of killing machines abandoned by the Japanese invaders, as well as many \"settlements,\" can still be found in various places. During this period, the Kuomintang government abandoned Northeast China, and Kuomintang officers such as Ma Zhanshan betrayed and surrendered to the enemy. Only the Communist Party members, under the guidance of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, maintained close ties with the people and fought bravely against the enemy in the deep mountains and forests.\n\n　　General Zhou Baozhong, formerly a leader of the Anti-Japanese United Army, paid tribute in his article to the martyrs of the Chinese Communist Party and people's heroes Luo Dengxian, Yang Jingyu, Wei Zhengmin, Wang Detai, Li Zhaolin, and Li Qidong, and to the Soviet soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the liberation of Northeast China.\n\n　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: On the 17th anniversary of the \"September 18th Incident,\" various agencies, organizations, factories, and schools in Harbin held meetings to commemorate the event. The Youth Workers Department of the Trade Union Federation and the Daowai Mao Zedong Youth League branch held lectures. Workers from the waterworks, telegraph, and telephone bureaus held forums to recall the \"September 18th Incident.\" Various people's education centers exhibited materials commemorating the \"September 18th Incident.\" The Daowai People's Education Center also exhibited photos of land reform, economic construction, army support, and victories in the revolutionary war in the liberated areas of Northeast China over the past three years. All newspapers also published special commemorative issues.\n\n　　The Northeast Daily published an editorial on that day entitled \"Oppose U.S. Imperialist Plot to Support Japan,\" pointing out that \"resolutely overcoming all difficulties and striving for new and greater victories until the complete liberation of all of China\" is the \"only effective way for the Chinese people to oppose U.S. imperialism's support of Japan.\"\n\n　　On the eve of the \"September 18th\" anniversary, the Officer Training Regiment of the Harbin PLA convened a forum of former Northeast Army officers. Everyone used their personal experiences to denounce the Kuomintang government's \"non-resistance policy\" and concrete facts of surrender and national betrayal during the \"September 18th Incident,\" as well as Chiang Kai-shek's various oppressions and destruction of the Northeast Army to eliminate dissidents.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北纪念“九一八”  高崇民等著文痛斥蒋贼卖国　哈市人民集会反对美帝扶日\n\n1948-09-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北纪念“九一八”\n    高崇民等著文痛斥蒋贼卖国\n  　哈市人民集会反对美帝扶日\n    【新华社东北二十六日电】“九一八”十七周年纪念日，东北政委会副主席高崇民、教育部长车向忱、松江省主席冯仲云、吉林省主席周保中等，均以亲身经历，撰文痛斥国民党政府出卖东北、出卖中国及美帝国主义以武器、废铁、汽油等作战物资支援日寇的罪行；他们并历数东北人民在日寇侵占下的十四年中，所遭受的种种非人世间的痛苦。他们指出：那时，只有共产党员和东北人民在一起坚持着斗争；也只有苏联，在国际上仗义执言，痛斥日本的侵略行动，并最后以强大红军帮助解放了东北。高副主席在“蒋匪帮不死，国难不止”一文结语中说：“八一五”后，蒋介石的唯一企图，就是要以美帝国主义代替过去的日本，使中国沦为美国帝国主义的殖民地，而他自己则代替溥仪和汪精卫。他号召东北人民在中国共产党领导下，努力支援解放战争，彻底摧毁国民党匪帮反动统治机构，建立新民主联合政府。原是抗日联军的领导者之一的冯仲云主席在“追忆惨痛的十四年”一文中说：十四年中，东北有如一座巨大的劳动营、监狱、刑场，成千成万的东北人民在被抓去为日寇建筑工事后被全部屠杀。为了对付抗日联军，日寇采取了三光政策，归屯并户，建立所谓“集团部落”。他说：直到现在，各地还可以发现日寇遗弃的各种刑具和杀人机器的残骸，以及不少“部落”。这期间，国民党政府把东北弃置不顾，国民党军马占山等叛变投敌，东北就只有共产党员在中共中央指示下，与人民紧密联系一起，在深山丛林中坚贞不屈地与敌人搏斗。前抗日联军领导者之一的周保中将军在文中向中共党员和人民英雄罗登贤、杨靖宇、魏拯民、王德泰、李兆麟、李启东等先烈和为解放东北而牺牲的苏联将士致敬。\n    【新华社东北二十三日电】“九一八”第十七周年，哈尔滨市各机关、团体、工厂、学校，纷纷集会纪念。职工总会青工部及道外毛泽东青年团分团部，分别举行讲演会；自来水厂、电报、电话局等职工举行回忆“九一八”的座谈。各民教馆分别展览纪念“九一八”的各种材料。道外民教馆并展览东北解放区三年来土地改革、经济建设、参军支前、革命战争胜利等照片。各报亦均出版纪念特刊。东北日报于是日发表题为“反对美帝扶日阴谋”的社论，指出：“坚决克服一切困难，争取新的更大的胜利，直到全中国的完全解放”，是中国人民“反对美帝扶日的唯一有效的道路”。哈市解放军官教导团于“九一八”纪念日前夕，召开旧东北军军官座谈会。大家都以亲身的经历，控诉“九一八”时国民党政府“不抵抗主义”和投降卖国的具体事实，以及蒋贼对东北军实行消灭异己政策的种种压迫与摧残。"

    "content": "Overcome Self-Flow, Strengthen Wheat Planting Leadership\n    Autumn Equinox has passed, and the wheat planting season is fast approaching. In areas where wheat has not yet been planted, efforts should be intensified to plant wheat and expand wheat fields immediately. In areas where wheat has already been planted, leaders should conduct thorough inspections, seize the time to resolve various difficulties faced by the masses, and strive to complete planting entirely, laying the foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign.\n\n    Based on incomplete materials currently available, the wheat planting movement is extremely uneven. In areas such as Taiyue, Taihang, and Central Hebei, the district party committees and administrative offices have issued general calls and provided specific guidance. In many places, they have publicized our party's land policy and the basic situation of \"Ending Land Reform\" during production leadership, and proposed the slogan of determining land ownership. Some villages have even issued land certificates, which have played a significant role in stabilizing people's hearts and minds and preparing for the successful completion of land reform. In many areas of Taihang and Taiyue, through the leadership of the party branch, the masses have been organized to plant wheat, accumulate fertilizer, and harvest autumn crops. This has established the leadership authority of the party branch among the masses, eliminated the concerns of some party members who \"fear being criticized,\" and laid a victorious foundation for the upcoming party rectification work. Under these circumstances, in areas where leadership has been good, deep plowing, sufficient fertilizer application, expansion of wheat fields, and selection of superior varieties have generally been achieved. Furthermore, the production enthusiasm of all strata has been encouraged during the wheat harvest, and the organizations of the party and the masses have been strengthened and consolidated.\n\n    It is important to note that there are still some areas where the tendency to neglect leadership over autumn harvesting and planting persists seriously. Many ideological concerns and practical difficulties of the masses have not been properly resolved. This should be given high attention by the leadership in various places.\n\n    This is specifically manifested in the following aspects:\n\n    First, it violates the basic spirit of \"paying attention to the season\" in the 1948 CPC Central Committee's instructions on land reform and party rectification work. It has failed to focus primary efforts on leading autumn harvesting and planting, simply emphasizing land reform and party rectification. No specific investigations have been conducted on autumn planting, nor have there been any special discussions. Some have simply copied the instructions and calls from above, while others have devoted all their efforts to running training classes and holding village cadre meetings, completely ignoring the major work of autumn harvesting and planting. Some places have only paid attention to \"seizing the time to end land reform,\" thinking that the common people would take care of autumn harvesting and planting themselves. As a result, leadership was abandoned, and the largest number of current demands and highest interests of the masses were neglected, which will actually add great difficulties to future work.\n\n    Second, the work style of dogmatism and bureaucratism of cadres is at play. Many cadres have the view that \"it is easier to make progress by doing land reform and party rectification, and it is not easy to make progress by leading production,\" and that \"first-class cadres are engaged in land reform, and second-class cadres are engaged in production.\" They underestimate the leadership of production, failing to recognize that leading production is a long-term construction task, and only regard it as a statistical number (such as how many mutual aid organizations have been formed, how many people have been affected by disasters, etc.) or a simple technical work that is \"always the same every year.\" This thinking is very common and has a great impact. It is manifested in the work style of leading production as serious bureaucratism. In many areas, cadres go to the countryside not to go deep into the masses to discover problems, solve problems, and promote production, but to ask village cadres for information, fill in forms with numbers, or hold unprepared and lengthy mass meetings or cadre meetings, exhausting everyone and affecting production. The production arrangements for each village are generalized: empty talk about \"party members taking the lead and the role of backbones\" without solving specific problems. In some places in Anguo, the phenomenon of \"the top calls, and the bottom sleeps\" has occurred. Taihang criticized this work style as a \"purely task-oriented viewpoint,\" detached from the masses and a tired old form of formalism, which will result in the failure of autumn harvesting and planting, which is critical to the success or failure of next year's large-scale production movement.\n\n    Third, some places lack specific and effective methods for resolving the ideological concerns of party members and the masses. \"Party members are afraid of being criticized,\" thinking that it is better to do less than more, and dare not actively lead the masses in production. The masses are afraid of \"equal distribution\" and afraid of \"not being able to keep it.\" As far as we know, many local party committees attach importance to this issue. The Taihang District clearly stated that the main task in the future is production, and the main content of ending land reform is to carry out a small amount of land adjustment in conjunction with correcting deviations. Central Hebei and other places have repeatedly publicized the slogan of \"whoever plants it, harvests it.\" Some counties in Taiyue have convened meetings of party members and labor heroes to dispel ideological concerns and promote mass production. Many places have expressed to the masses that \"land reform has basically been completed, and land ownership will be determined in the future,\" and all these measures have played a very good role in stabilizing people's hearts and minds. However, it is rare to see specific analysis of the ideological conditions of various strata in the villages, and the identification and resolution of specific problems that currently exist based on the specific conditions of each place. In some places in Central Hebei, explaining policies to the masses through typical figures and facts is one method. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee has adopted the method of conducting in-depth investigations of one or two villages to help party committees at all levels concretely understand the central government's policies for old and semi-old areas, and ideologically resolve the understanding of the degree of completion of land reform. This method is also better for mass propaganda. Today, the biggest weakness in our propaganda work is that we only put forward general slogans to the masses, without linking them to specific facts that the masses are most familiar with and concerned about. The masses do not feel close to it, and they are half-convinced, affecting their enthusiasm for wheat planting.\n\n    Fourth, attention should be paid to solving some specific difficulties of the masses in a timely manner. This is manifested differently in various regions. In the saw-toothed region of Henan in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the masses' large numbers of livestock and strong laborers were robbed by the enemy, making them unable to plant wheat. Although this issue has been reported, no active measures have been seen to solve it specifically. The biggest difficulty for the masses in various disaster-stricken areas is the lack of seeds. This newspaper has repeatedly received appeals from readers in Central Hebei and Southern Hebei requesting seed loans and exchanges. We hope that various places will conduct further inspections. Mobilizing the masses in Central Hebei to boil saltpeter to exchange for wheat seeds, and the Shouyang Democratic Government's timely allocation of 520 stones of wheat to adjust seeds, are examples worth emulating. Conversely, there are still many areas that only put forward the empty slogan of \"social mutual assistance\" without conducting in-depth investigations to come up with various specific methods, which only delays the wheat planting season. In the support-the-front areas, the young and strong have gone to the front line. It is also important to note that labor should be organized rationally and production should be arranged properly, so that the land of wartime laborers and military martyrs' families is not \"wronged.\" In addition, there are those who are unwilling to plant wheat due to excessive burdens last year, and those who are unable to drain water due to flooding, which affects wheat planting. These must be carefully and seriously resolved.\n\n    Time is extremely urgent. All rapid and effective methods must be adopted to check the wheat planting situation in various places, commend the good, criticize the bad, and not be satisfied with various figures and reports, but go deep into the masses to conduct serious inspections. The Ninth Prefectural Committee of Central Hebei has already started this inspection work. At the same time, the leadership should earnestly give cadres specific help, so that they truly understand the party's policies, the working principles in various regions, and the basic situation of land reform in the local area, and make them clear about the serious significance of industrial and agricultural production in the long-term construction of North China in the future, and tell them that the ideological deviations of the peasant class can be corrected with correct publicity and explanation, and the various concerns of the masses will not find a way to express. All of this depends on: \"Strengthening wheat planting guidance.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 克服自流，加强种麦领导\n\n1948-09-28\n第1版()\n专栏：专论\n\n　　克服自流，加强种麦领导\n    秋分已过，种麦季节眼看就要过了，未种上的地区要立即加紧种麦扩大麦田，已种上的地区领导上则应深入检查，抓紧时间解决群众各方面困难，不失时机的争取全部种上，打下明年大生产运动基础。\n    依据目前不完整的材料看，种麦运动表现为极不平衡，在太岳、太行、冀中等地，区党委行署均做了普遍号召并进行了具体指导，许多地方在领导生产中宣传了我党土地政策和“结束土改”的基本情况，提出了确定地权的口号；有些村子还发了土地证，这在安定人心和准备顺利完成结束土改工作上都起了极大的作用。太行、太岳许多地区通过支部领导群众种麦积肥收秋，树立了支部在群众中的领导威信，消除了某些党员“怕挨整”的疑虑，给即将到来的整党工作打下了胜利的基础。在这样情况下，凡是领导得好的地区，一般地均做到犁深粪饱，扩大了麦田，选了优良品种，并在麦收中鼓舞了各阶层生产情绪，健全和巩固了党和群众的组织。\n    值得我们注意的是：仍有若干地区至今仍然严重的存在着忽视领导秋收秋种的偏向，群众的许多思想顾虑和实际困难都还没有得到适当的解决。应引起各地领导上高度注意。\n    这具体的表现在以下几个方面：\n    第一、是违背了一九四八年中共中央土改工作和整党工作指示中“必须注意季节”的基本精神，没有把主要力量放在领导秋收秋耕，只是单纯的着重了土改和整党，对秋耕秋种既未做具体调查，也没做专门讨论，有的把上边的指示号召照抄一遍，有的则以全部力量忙于开训练班，开村干会议，对于秋收秋耕的重大工作根本没有理睬，有的地方只注意了“争取时间，结束土改”，以为秋收秋耕老百姓自己会搞，结果放弃领导，脱离群众当前的最大多数要求和最高利益，实际上将要给今后工作增加极大困难。\n    第二、干部的经验主义官僚主义作风在作怪。不少干部有这样一个看法：“做土改整党容易进步，领导生产不容易进步”，“头等干部搞土改，次的干部搞生产”，轻视领导生产，不认识领导生产是长期的建设工作，只把它看作统计数目字（如互助组织了多少，受灾人口多少等）或是“年年总是这么一套”的单纯的技术工作。这种思想非常普遍，影响也很大，表现在领导生产的作风上便是严重的官僚主义。不少地区干部下乡不是深入群众中去发现问题解决问题推动生产，而是向村干要情况，要数字填表，或是开无准备的漫长的群众会或干部会，弄的大家精疲力竭，影响生产。对各村生产布置是一般化的：空谈什么“党员带头，骨干作用”，不解决具体问题。安国有些地方就发生了“上边号召，下边睡觉”的现象。太行批评这种作风为“单纯任务观点”，脱离群众，形式主义老一套，其结果会使关系明年大生产运动成败的秋收秋耕工作落空。\n    第三、有些地方对解决党员和群众的思想顾虑缺乏具体有效的方法，“党员怕挨整”，认为多一事不如少一事，不敢积极领导群众生产，群众怕“平分”，怕“落不住”。据我们所知很多地方党委是重视了这一问题，太行区明确提出今后主要任务是生产，结束土改工作的主要内容是结合纠偏进行小部分之土地调剂，冀中等地一再宣传“谁种谁收”的口号，太岳有些县召集党员、劳动英雄会议，解除思想顾虑并推动群众生产。许多地方都向群众表示“土改基本上完成，今后要确定地权”等，这一切措施都起了很好地安定人心的作用。但如何在村里具体分析各阶层的思想状况，依据各地具体条件，找出现在存在的具体问题加以解决，还很少见。冀中有些地方通过典型的人物及事实去向群众解释政策是一种方法。冀鲁豫区党委采取深入调查一二村庄情况，帮助各级党委具体认识中央对老区半老区政策，从思想上解决对土改完成程度的认识，这种方法对群众宣传同样也较好。今天我们宣传工作最大的弱点是只向群众提一般的口号，而没有把它同具体的群众最熟悉最关切的事实连系起来，群众听了不亲切，以致半信半疑，影响了种麦的积极性。\n    第四、群众有些具体困难应注意及时解决，这在各种不同地区各有不同的表现；冀鲁豫河南拉锯地区，群众大批牲口和壮丁被敌人抢走，以致无力种麦，这一问题虽有报导，但如何具体解决尚未见有积极措施，各地受灾区群众最大困难是缺乏种子，本报曾一再接到冀中、冀南读者呼吁，要求贷种换种，希望各地再作检查。象冀中动员群众熬硝换麦种，寿阳民主政府及时拨麦五百二十石调剂种子，都是一些值得仿效的例子。相反的还有不少地区只提出“社会互济”的空洞口号，而不做深入调查想出各种具体办法，结果只有耽搁了种麦季节。在支前地区青壮走上前线，合理的组织劳力安排生产，而不让打战民工及军干烈属土地“背屈”，也是值得注意的一个问题。此外还有是因去年负担过重而不愿种麦的，也有因被水淹无力排水而影响种麦的。这些均要细密的认真的求得解决。\n    时间异常紧迫，必须采取一切迅速而有效的方法检查各地种麦情形，表扬好的，批评坏的，不要满足于各种数目字及报告，而要深入到群众中去认真检查。冀中九地委已经开始了这一检查工作。同时领导上应认真给干部以具体帮助，使他们真正了解党的政策，各种不同地区工作方针，了解当地土改的基本状况，使他们明确在工农业生产在今后华北长期建设工作中的严重意义，告诉他们以正确的宣传解释农民阶级的思想偏向端正了，群众的各种疑虑便始终找不到门径。而所有这一切都依靠于：“加强种麦指导”。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. A dispatch from Amsterdam on the 23rd via Electric Communication Agency: The newly appointed General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, the well-known and experienced Musso, delivered an important statement on the policies of the reorganized Indonesian Communist Party at a mass meeting in Madiun (formerly translated as Maidi'en) ten days before the workers took over the city. Musso was expelled from the country by the Dutch in 1926. His return has made a deep impression on the people. It is said that 90,000 people attended the meeting. Musso frankly condemned the Republic's government's attempt to compromise with the Dutch and Americans. He declared: \"We do not recognize the truce agreement, nor do we recognize the Renville Agreement.\" By accepting the American \"mediation\" proposal, Hatta is once again allowing the country to fall into a colonial status. Musso pointed out that the Indonesian revolution is only the beginning of a national revolution, not a socialist revolution or a communist revolution. Although the revolution has been going on for three years, workers, farmers, women, and youth have not enjoyed the fruits of the national revolution. He continued: This is due to \"mistakes made at the beginning, and the Communist Party also made mistakes.\" He said: \"Externally, we firmly oppose imperialism, but internally, we maintain certain old conventions and remnants of feudalism, so there is no sign of new democracy.\" As a result, the leadership of the revolution fell into the hands of the propertied class, while the working class was completely excluded. After narrating the examples of the Soviet Union and New Democracy, Musso stated: The leadership of the country must be handed over to progressive workers, land will be equally distributed, and new village chiefs must be elected from poor farmers. He said: \"In our revolution, the Dutch colonial army is our enemy. But if there are those among our Indonesian people who oppose the realization of the national revolution, we will classify them in the same category as the Dutch.\" The Communist Party is ready to cooperate with other political parties, provided they have the courage to fight against the Dutch reactionaries. When he spoke of the world being divided into two camps, peace and imperialism, he said, \"Can we remain neutral in the struggle between the two camps? Absolutely not. We must choose the anti-imperialist camp.\" Musso pointed out that there are now 130,000 Dutch troops in Indonesia. \"But compared with 70 million people—from whom our soldiers come—what does this number count for?\" He urged the workers to train themselves to defend the Republic. He called for close cooperation with the people in the Dutch-occupied areas and declared his confidence in liberating those Republic territories that have been seized.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 印尼共产党总书记发表演说　声述目前党的政策  革命领导权应归于工人阶级\n\n1948-09-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　印尼共产党总书记发表演说\n  　声述目前党的政策\n    革命领导权应归于工人阶级\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】电通社阿姆斯特丹二十三日电：印尼共产党新任总书记、闻名而有经验的穆索，于工人接管茉莉芬（前译为马地恩）前十日，在该城群众大会上发表关于改组后的印尼共产党政策的重要声明。穆索在一九二六年曾被荷兰驱逐出境。他的归来，给予人民深刻的印象。据称：参加这次会议的群众达九万人。穆索率直地谴责共和国政府企图与荷美妥协。他宣称：“我们不承认停战协定，也不承认伦维尔协定。”由于接受美国“调处”建议，哈达正再次使国家沦陷到殖民地地位。穆索指出：印尼革命只是民族革命的开始，这不是社会主义革命或共产主义革命。虽然革命已有三年，但工人、农民、妇女与青年却享受不到民族革命的果实。他继称：这是由于“在开始时犯了错误，共产党也犯了错误”。他说：“对外我们坚决反对帝国主义，但对内我们却保持某些旧的成规和封建主义的残余，因此还没有新民主主义的迹象。”结果革命的领导权落到有产阶级的手里，而工人阶级却完全被排斥在外。穆索在叙述苏联与新民主主义的例子之后称：国家的领导权必须交到进步的工人手里，土地将予平分，新村长须自贫苦农民中选出。他说：“在我们的革命中，荷兰殖民军是我们的敌人。但假若在我们印尼人民中间有反对实现民族革命的那些人，我们必将他们与荷兰人划归一类。”共产党准备与其他政党合作，假如他们有勇气与荷兰反动派作战的话。他在谈及世界分裂为和平与帝国主义两个阵营时，说道：“在两个阵营的斗争中，我们能够保持中立吗？绝对不能。我们必须选择反帝阵营。”穆索指出：现在印尼有荷军十三万。“但若与七千万人——我们的士兵即来自其中——相较，这个数目又算得什么？”他敦促工人们为保卫共和国而锻炼自己。他呼吁与荷占区人民密切合作，并宣布有信心解放那些被夺去的共和国领土。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th—Comprehensive reports: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, a self-defense armed uprising of Indonesian patriotic people against the treasonous and capitulationist Hatta government has broken out. According to a TASS dispatch citing a Dutch news agency report from Batavia: Communists took over Madiun, a major city in Java (currently the third largest city in the Indonesian Republic region, located in eastern Java, northeast of Yogyakarta) on the 18th. Hatta government communiqués also acknowledged that regular troops in Madiun, under the leadership of the Communist Party, participated in the uprising. Various sources cite Madiun radio broadcasts on the 19th stating: The Deputy Mayor of Madiun has been appointed Chairman of the Javanese Revolutionary Government, and Colonel Zoko Suyono has been appointed Commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces; Indonesian Communist leader Muso issued a proclamation to the Indonesian people on the 19th, denouncing Sukarno and Hatta as lackeys of American and Japanese imperialism, and criticizing their implementation of treasonous and capitulationist policies for the past three years. Muso urged the people to rise up and fight for national independence. A statement broadcast by Madiun radio stated: The Sukarno-Hatta government, which has betrayed the interests of the Indonesian nation, must be overthrown and replaced by a new government that serves the interests of all the people. Five days before the Madiun uprising, on the 13th of this month, fighting broke out in Solo (northeast of Yogyakarta), the second largest city in the Indonesian Republic region; as of the 20th, armed conflicts between patriotic elements and uprising soldiers led by the Communist Party, and the Kuomintang, the Islamic Party, the Trotskyist \"People's Revolutionary Movement,\" and the forces of Song Ke-no, who were ordered to suppress the uprising, were still ongoing in Solo.\n\nPrior to this armed uprising of the Indonesian patriotic people, the Hatta government had first attacked the Indonesian people. On the 11th of this month, two days before the Solo fighting, the Hatta government instructed the police to \"sweep\" patriotic armed forces resisting the Dutch invading army in Central Java. On the 16th, two days before the Madiun uprising, Hatta delivered an anti-communist and anti-people speech to the working committee of the parliament, openly becoming an enemy of the people, and announced the release of the notorious Trotskyist leaders Chen Malujia and Sukani, who were arrested the year before, deliberately using them to alienate workers and oppose communism. On the 19th, Sukarno further ordered the arrest of Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Muso in a radio broadcast and declared martial law throughout Java. On the 20th, Sukarno obtained so-called dictatorial powers from the parliament to \"resist the Communist Party.\" The Hatta government has now torn off its mask of democracy. In Yogyakarta alone, more than 200 democratic elements, including trade union leaders, were arrested in 24 hours. Communist and leftist newspapers in Yogyakarta have been sealed, and all public demonstrations and propaganda activities have been banned. The Hatta government's actions have been applauded and supported by American and Dutch imperialism. Dutch Foreign Minister Stiek, who recently arrived in Washington to confer with Marshall and reached an agreement, declared on the 20th: the US and the Netherlands \"generally discussed how to reach a decision to help constructive elements in Indonesia (should read: treasonous and surrenderist elements),\" and \"invited Hatta to conclude a new agreement with the Netherlands to deal with the Communist Party and resolve Indonesia's future status.\" On the 21st, Dutch-Indies Governor-General Mook also hurried to leave The Hague for Batavia, and declared that \"the Dutch government is prepared to support the Hatta government.\" Long before the Indonesian people's armed uprising, American and Dutch imperialism had been plotting to stage an anti-people coup in Indonesia. \"According to London sources, one of the purposes of Dutch Foreign Minister Stiek's consultations with US Secretary of State Marshall in Washington was to report on the progress of the Netherlands in preparing for a leftist coup.\" (Telecommunications Agency, London, 20th)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 反对卖国投降的哈达政府　印尼爆发革命内战  第三大城茉莉芬已为共产党接管\n\n1948-09-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　在共产党领导下\n  　反对卖国投降的哈达政府\n  　印尼爆发革命内战\n    第三大城茉莉芬已为共产党接管\n    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合报导：在共产党领导之下，印尼爆发了爱国人民反对卖国投降的哈达政府的自卫武装起义。据塔斯社引荷兰通讯社巴达维亚消息：共产党已于十八日接管爪哇大城市茉莉芬（目前印尼共和国地区的第三大城，位于爪哇东部，日惹东北方向）。哈达政府公报亦承认茉莉芬的正规军在共产党领导下参加起义。各方引述茉莉芬电台十九日广播称：茉莉芬副市长已被任命为爪哇革命政府主席、左柯苏约诺上校已被任命为革命武装部队司令；印尼共产党领袖穆索于十九日发表告印尼人民书，斥责苏加诺与哈达为美、日帝国主义的奴才，斥责他们三年来执行卖国投降的政策。穆索敦促人民起来为国家的独立而斗争。茉莉芬电台广播的声明称：必须推翻出卖印尼民族利益的苏加诺——哈达政府，而代之以符合全民利益的新政府。在茉莉芬起义之前五日，即本月十三日，印尼共和国地区的第二大城市梭罗（日惹之东北）就发生了战事；截至二十日止，以共产党为首的爱国分子及起义士兵，与国民党、回教党、托派“人民革命运动”及受命镇压起义的宋柯诺所部之间的武装冲突，仍在梭罗进行中。\n    在这次印尼爱国人民武装起义之前，哈达政府即首先向印尼人民进攻。本月十一日，即梭罗战事发生前两天，哈达政府即已指使警察在爪哇中部“扫荡”正在抵抗荷兰侵略军的爱国武装。至十六日，即茉莉芬起义前两日，哈达在国会工作委员会上又发表反共反人民演说，公然与人民为敌，并宣布释放前年被捕的恶名昭彰的托派头子陈马六甲和苏卡尼，蓄意利用他们来离间工人与反共。十九日，苏加诺在广播中更下令逮捕印尼共产党总书记穆索，并宣布爪哇全境戒严。二十日，苏加诺又从国会获得了所谓“抗击共产党”的独裁大权。哈达政府现已撕下民主假面具，仅在日惹，二十四小时内就逮捕了二百余民主分子，包括职工会领袖。日惹的共产党及左翼报纸已被查封，一切公共示威和宣传活动均遭禁止。哈达政府的行动获得美荷帝国主义的喝采与支持。新近抵华盛顿与马歇尔会商并获得协议的荷兰外长斯蒂克于二十日宣称：美荷“一般地讨论了怎样达到帮助印尼建设性分子（应读为卖国投降分子）的决定”，并“邀请哈达与荷兰缔结新的协议以对付共产党及解决印尼将来的地位”。二十一日，荷印总督穆克也赶忙离海牙飞巴达维亚，并声明“荷兰政府准备支持哈达政府”。远在印尼人民武装起义之前，美荷帝国主义即进行在印尼布置反人民政变的阴谋，“据伦敦方面人士谈，荷外长斯蒂克在华盛顿与美国务卿马歇尔会商目的之一，就是报告关于荷兰在准备左派分子政变一事上的进展”。（电通社伦敦二十日电）"

    "content": "Bureaucracy Leads to Uncontrolled Production\n　　No Leadership in Wheat Planting in the First District of Changzi\n　　[Taiyue Electric] According to the production inspection team of the Yuebei Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office: Bureaucracy exists in the leadership of production in the Changzi area, affecting the wheat planting work. On the 28th of last month, when the district held a meeting of all district cadres to report on production work, it was very perfunctory, and no problems were raised or resolved before preparing to end it. The inspection team suggested a thorough inspection. When asked how much the prefecture had allocated to the county for wheat seeds out of the 400 shi of wheat seeds and 27 million yuan of fertilizer loans, none of the twelve district cadres present knew. However, according to Director Yang of the county office, the wheat planting loans were distributed to the districts on August 9th, but it had been 20 days since then. Although the loans were distributed later, they were very untimely. Lingshang Village received a fertilizer loan of 92,000 yuan, but it was only issued to the village on the 5th of this month. Some villagers had already planted wheat, so a portion of the loan could not be used, which affected the enthusiasm of the masses to apply manure. Secondly, the production leadership organization in the entire district is also very unsound. The Northwest Sub-district, with sixteen administrative villages, has not established production committees. Each village only has one production committee member who only does some work such as allocating preferential treatment to military families, and rarely inquires about the overall production of the village. The district has also failed to supervise and inspect this. The reason for these phenomena, according to this discussion, is mainly that the leadership has a bureaucratic work style, does not understand the situation in the villages, and does not have a complete set of sound systems. For example, instructions from higher levels to lower levels are often kept by whoever receives them in their pockets or backpacks, and there is no explanation when they go out. The ideological root cause is that some comrades have the mistaken idea that \"the masses will produce even without leadership,\" and the leadership has failed to educate and correct this in a timely manner, resulting in uncontrolled production. Only after this meeting did it attract everyone's attention.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 官僚主义生产自流　长子一区种麦没领导\n\n1948-09-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　官僚主义生产自流\n  　长子一区种麦没领导\n    【太岳电】据岳北地委与专署生产检查小组报告：长子一带，对生产的领导存在着官僚主义，影响了种麦工作。上月二十八日，该区召开全区干部会议汇报生产工作时很潦草，也没提出和解决什么问题，就准备结束。检查组提议深入检查一下，问到专署给全县贷麦种四百石，肥料贷款二千七百万元，该区分配了多少，怎样分配的，到会的十二个区干部竟没有一个人知道。但据县里办公室杨主任谈，八月九日种麦贷款即已分配到区，当时已过了二十天。以后贷款虽分发了，但已很不及时。岭上村贷了九万二千元肥料贷款，本月五日才发到村，有的群众麦已经种上了，所以有一部分就贷不出去，影响了群众上粪。其次，全区生产领导组织上也很不健全，西北小区十六个行政村都没建立起生产委员会，每村只有一个生产委员，只作了一些拨差优军等工作，对全村生产很少过问，区上对此也没有督促检查。产生这些现象的原因，据这次讨论，主要是领导上存在着官僚主义作风，不了解村中情况，也没有整套健全制度，如上级对下的指示，往往是谁收到谁装到口袋里或放到背包里，出外走了也没有个交代。其思想根源是一部分同志存在着“不用领导群众也会生产”的错误想法，领导上也未能及时教育纠正，以致生产形成自流。经过这次会议，才引起大家的注意。"

    "content": "Overcoming Natural Disasters to Save Autumn Crops\n  　Average Harvest Across the Region Reaches Sixty-Five Percent\n    [Our dispatch] This newspaper reports: Autumn harvesting is being accelerated in the vast areas of North China. According to preliminary estimates from various sources, the average harvest in the region this year is around sixty-five percent, which is better than the fifty percent harvest of the entire region last year. Spring rainfall was generally well-distributed, and the average wheat harvest across the region was around eighty percent. Better areas after the autumn harvest may reach over eighty percent, such as the first and second districts of Taiyue, the fifth and sixth districts of Beiyue, the Changzhi area of Taiyuan, and the areas east of Yuncheng and west of Weishan Lake in Jilu Yu, including Jiaxiang, Jinxiang, Yuncheng, and Juye counties. It is estimated that the average harvest in Taiyue, Beiyue, and Jizhong regions this year will be around seventy percent; while the average in Jinan, Jilu Yu, and Taihang regions will be around sixty percent. The average for the entire North China region will be around sixty-five percent.\n\n    Floods, insect plagues, hailstorms, and partial droughts have impacted this year's autumn harvest in North China, leading to a poor harvest. Cadres at all levels in the North China region and the broad masses of people have made efforts to combat various disasters, reducing their impact on the autumn fields. However, due to various limitations, some losses were still incurred. This year, over eighty counties in the region suffered from floods, with over 11 million mu of autumn fields affected. Jizhong and Jinan were the most severely affected. In Jizhong, multiple breaches occurred in the Zulong River and upstream of the Hutuo River, flooding Gaocheng, Jinxian, Shenze, Anping, Raoyang, Gaoyang, Renqiu, Suning, and other counties. Among the more than 4.9 million mu of autumn fields affected in this area, approximately 2.5 million mu yielded no harvest at all. In Jinan, approximately 3 million mu of land in 22 counties along the Fuyang River and upstream of the Wei River, including Yongnian, Baixiang, Longyao, and Ningjin, were affected by floods. Parts of Pingshan and Xingtang in the Beiyue region, Anyang and Yexian along the Zhang River in the Taihang region, and Kunshan, Jining, and Hua County in Jilu Yu also suffered damage. Insect pests were found in over 150 counties across the region, with more than half of the counties experiencing severe infestations. In the second and fourth districts of Jinan, over one million mu of crops were eaten by armyworms and locust nymphs, resulting in an estimated reduction of 16 million jin of grain. In Jizhong, over 3,900 villages in the eighth, ninth, and eleventh districts suffered from insect pests, resulting in a 30 to 50 percent reduction in the autumn harvest. In the Taihang region, locusts damaged over 100,000 mu of autumn seedlings in more than ten counties including Linxian and Tangyin. In some areas, rainfall was delayed after the wheat harvest, and late autumn crops could not be sown in time. Some autumn seedlings suffered from drought after being sown, resulting in poor harvests in small areas of Jilu Yu, Jinan, Taihang, and Beiyue regions. Wind and hail disasters also caused damage in some areas, with 43 counties across the region suffering from hailstorms, affecting an area of approximately 1.8 million mu. In total, the area affected by various disasters was over 15 million mu, accounting for approximately one-tenth of the total cultivated area of 155.6 million mu in North China (excluding the Jinzhong district).\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 战胜天灾挽救秋苗　全区收成平均六成半\n\n1948-09-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　战胜天灾挽救秋苗\n  　全区收成平均六成半\n    【本报讯】总分社记者报导：华北广大区域正加紧秋收。据各方面初步估计：今年全区收成平均在六成半上下。较优于去年全区之五成年景。今春雨水一般比较调匀，全区麦收平均八成上下。秋后较好地区可达八成以上，如太岳之一、二分区，北岳之五、六分区，太原之长治一带，冀鲁豫之运东及微山湖以西之嘉祥、金乡、郓城、巨野等县。估计今年太岳、北岳、冀中各区平均在七成上下；冀南、冀鲁豫、太行各区平均在六成上下。全华北区平均在六成半上下。\n    水灾、虫灾、雹灾及一部分旱灾，影响华北秋田今年歉收。华北区各级干部与广大人民，曾对各种灾害努力进行斗争，减少其对于秋田的影响。但受各种条件限制，仍造成部分损失。全区今年有八十余县遭水灾，被灾秋田达一千一百余万亩。其中以冀中、冀南最为严重。冀中潴龙河、滹沱河上游多处决口，冲淹藁城、晋县、深泽、安平、饶阳、高阳、任邱、肃宁等县。在该区被灾之四百九十多万亩秋田中约有二百五十多万亩全无收成。冀南滏阳河及卫河上游之永年、柏乡、隆尧、宁津等二十二县，受水灾面积约三百万亩。北岳区之平山、行唐，太行区漳河沿岸之安阳、邺县，冀鲁豫之昆山、济宁、滑县等处均有部分受灾。全区有一百五十余县发现害虫，半数以上县份较重。冀南二、四分区被黏虫蝗蝻吃光的庄稼有百万亩，估计减收一千六百万斤。冀中在八、九、十一等分区有三千九百余村遭虫害，被害秋田减收百分之三十至五十。太行林县、汤阴等十余县蝗虫吃坏秋苗十余万亩。某些地区麦收后落雨较迟，晚秋未能及时播种，有的已播种后秋苗受旱，在冀鲁豫、冀南、太行、北岳等地均有少部分地区歉收。风、雹等灾，亦在部分地区成害，全区遭雹灾地区县份达四十三县；受灾面约一百八十万亩。总计各种受灾面积为一千五百余万亩，约占华北全部耕地面积一万万五千六百余万亩中十分之一（不包括晋中分区）。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th -- Reports from various sources: The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the \"Workers' Force\" union, and the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) issued a joint communiqué, calling on their eight million members to hold a two-hour general strike on September 24th. The communiqué pointed out: French workers can use this national demonstration to express their strong will to be able to maintain their livelihood. Prior to the issuance of the joint communiqué by the three major unions, strike movements had already spread throughout France, especially in Paris. On the 15th, 90,000 aviation, automobile, and steel workers in the Paris region held a strike. Aviation workers also marched in formation to the front of the head office of the state-owned airline, holding small flags with the slogans \"We want bread!\", \"We want a democratic government!\", and \"Down with the Marshall Plan!\". On the 16th, 400,000 metalworkers in the Paris region held a 24-hour strike, demanding a 33% wage increase. The Pravda reporter Zhukov reported from Paris that the current characteristic of the French workers' movement is that \"the workers' economic demands are increasingly combined with political demands. Now, the most advanced workers are not only demanding wage increases. Experience has shown that even when they obtain wage increases, prices rise again. These most advanced workers are bravely meeting the difficulties; they are opposing the 'Marshall Plan,' demanding the abolition of France's economic dependence on the United States, and demanding the establishment of a democratic coalition government that does not serve Wall Street but can safeguard the interests of France. Workers are gaining increasingly frequent and resolute support from farmers, artisans, and small merchants who are also suffering from the 'Marshall Plan.'\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 法三大工会号召八百万会员　定期举行总罢工示威  巴黎数十万工人罢工要面包要民主\n\n1948-09-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　法三大工会号召八百万会员\n  　定期举行总罢工示威\n    巴黎数十万工人罢工要面包要民主\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】各方报导：法国总工会、“工人力量”工会、基督教工人联盟发表联合公报，号召其所属之八百万会员于九月二十四日举行两小时总罢工。公报指出：法国工人可借这一全国性的大示威，以表示他们要求能够维持生存的坚强意志。在三大工会的联合公报发表以前，全法各地已弥漫着罢工运动，特别是在巴黎。十五日，巴黎区九万航空、汽车、钢铁工人举行罢工。航空工人并列队往国营航空公司总公司门前示威，他们手执小旗，上书“我们要面包！”“我们要民主的政府！”“打倒马歇尔计划！”。十六日，巴黎区的四十万金属工人举行二十四小时的罢工，要求加薪百分之三十三。真理报记者朱可夫自巴黎报导称：目前法国工人运动的特点，是“工人的经济要求与政治要求日益结合。现在，最先进的工人不仅是要求增资而已。经验业已表明，即便当他们获得增资时，物价又有新的上涨。这些最先进的工人正奋勇迎接困难，他们正反对‘马歇尔计划’，要求取消法国对美国经济上的依赖，要求建立民主联合的政府，这个政府不为华尔街服务，而能维护法国的利益。工人正获得同样遭受‘马歇尔计划’打击的农民、手工业工人和小商人越来越经常而坚决的支持。”"

Representatives from 58 countries attended the assembly. The agenda includes approximately 70 items, including many issues of great importance to the peace and security of all nations. However, on the eve of the assembly's opening, Western newspapers launched a propaganda offensive to spread doubts about the assembly's success and to deepen divisions among member states. A spokesman for the US delegation revealed the purpose of this offensive, namely that they feared the Soviet Union would once again take the initiative in the assembly and use the assembly's platform to fight against warmongers. After the opening remarks by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, in his capacity as temporary president of the assembly, and a welcoming speech by French President Auriol, in his capacity as host country, the assembly proceeded to elect the various organizations of the assembly. Because the US-controlled group was determined to occupy all important positions with its supporters, at the expense of undermining the UN Charter's tradition that assembly positions should be distributed according to geographical fairness, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, a faithful accomplice of the US-British bloc, was elected as the President of this session of the General Assembly after a vote. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, who had actively served the interests of the Anglo-American group in the previous session, was elected as the Chairman of the Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly. The chairmanships of the other five committees—Finance and Economy, Social and Humanitarian, Trusteeship, Administrative Budget, and Legal—were also seized by representatives from Chile, Lebanon, Iran, Canada, and Panama, all members of the US-British group. The results of the first day of the assembly proved that the majority of the assembly preferred to move the voting machine to advance the interests of the Anglo-American group. The assembly will elect seven vice-presidents on the 22nd, and then the president, the seven vice-presidents, and the chairmen of the six committees will form the fourteen-member steering committee of the assembly.\n    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Reports from various sources: Delegations from various countries attending the Third United Nations General Assembly have successively arrived in Paris. The Soviet delegation arrived in Paris by plane on the 20th, led by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, who delivered a famous speech at the UN General Assembly last year denouncing war profiteers. Members of the delegation included Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Soviet representative to the Security Council Malik, Ambassador to France Bogomolov, Ambassador to Belgium Pavlov, and Soviet Foreign Ministry official Yarujian. The US and British delegations, headed by Marshall and Bevin respectively, arrived in Paris on the 20th. The notorious American warmonger and Republican Dulles remains a representative of the United States. Delegations from other countries have either arrived or are en route. It is said that the agenda of this UN General Assembly includes more than seventy items, and the session is estimated to last more than two months. The Soviet newspaper Pravda pointed out that in the course of the meeting, \"the US-British group will try its best to turn the United Nations into a tool of their foreign policy.\" But this attempt will inevitably be resolutely countered by the anti-imperialist camp led by the Soviet Union. Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Clementis declared on the 19th, when departing for Paris, that the Czechoslovak delegation would defend the principles on which the United Nations was founded.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 第三届联大开幕　苏代表团团长仍为维辛斯基  英美预谋加深各会员国分裂\n\n1948-09-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　第三届联大开幕\n  　苏代表团团长仍为维辛斯基\n    英美预谋加深各会员国分裂\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社报导：第三届联合国大会于九月二十一日下午三时二十分在巴黎夏洛宫开幕。大会到有五十八国的代表，议程约达七十　项，其中包括许多对各国和平与安全具有重要意义的议题。但在大会开幕前夕，西方国家的报纸为了散布对大会成功的怀疑及加深各会员国间的分裂，发动了宣传攻势。美国代表团发言人道出了这种攻势的用意，即他们唯恐苏联再次在大会中取得主动，并利用大会讲坛与战争贩子作斗争。大会在阿根廷外长布拉马格里亚以大会临时主席资格致开幕词及法总统阿里奥尔以东道国资格致欢迎词后，即进行大会各组织的选举工作。由于美国控制下的集团决心以其拥护者占据一切重要职位，不惜破坏联合国宪章关于大会职位应遵照地域公平分配的传统，经表决结果，美英忠实的走卒澳外长伊瓦特被选为本届大会主席。上次大会中曾为英美集团积极效力的比外长斯巴克被选为大会的政治安全委员会主席，其他财政经济、社会人道、托管、行政预算及法律五个委员的主席，亦分别为美英集团中的智利、黎巴嫩、伊朗、加拿大、巴拿马五国代表所盘据。大会头一天的结果证明：大会的多数宁愿拨动表决器以增进英美集团的利益。大会将于二十二日选举大会副主席七人，然后由主席、七个副主席及六个委员会主席组成大会的十四人指导委员会。\n    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方报导：出席第三届联合国大会的各国代表团，已相继抵达巴黎。苏联代表团于廿日乘机抵巴黎，团长仍为去年在联大会上发表著名痛斥战贩演说的苏联副外长维辛斯基。团员有苏副外长兼苏驻安理会代表马立克、驻法大使鲍格莫洛夫、驻比大使巴夫洛夫及苏外交部官员亚鲁疆。美、英两国代表团分别以马歇尔与贝文为首，于二十日抵达巴黎。美国著名战争贩子及共和党人杜勒斯，仍为美国的代表。其他国家的代表团，或则已抵达或正在途中。据称：这次联大议程共达七十余项，会期估计将历时两月以上。苏联真理报指出：在会议过程中，“美、英集团将竭力企图把联合国变成它们外交政策的工具”。但这种企图必将受到以苏联为首的反帝国主义阵营的坚决打击。捷外长克里门蒂斯十九日在启程赴巴黎时宣称：捷代表团将保卫创建联合国时所根据的原则。"

    "content": "[Taiyue Telegraph] The Yicheng Third District Ganquan Base Point Work Group went deep into the mountain villages to inspect and solve the difficulties in wheat planting in the mountain villages. The residents of Ganquan administrative village live very scattered. In order to understand the difficulties of the masses in wheat planting in various mountain villages, the work group recently went deep into the natural villages to conduct inspections and found that two problems in six natural villages, including Shifo, hindered wheat planting. First, the preferential treatment for military families and cultivation on their behalf was very chaotic. The village head, militia, and agricultural association executive committee members did not comply with the duty of cultivating on behalf of military families. Second, some poor farmers had not yet planted wheat because they did not have enough wheat seeds. The work group then convened a meeting of cadres and group leaders from various villages to explain the \"Service Draft\" of the Administrative Office regarding the methods of cultivating on behalf of military families, review the work of cultivating on behalf of military families, conduct criticism, and discuss how to solve the problems of cultivating on behalf of military families and the lack of wheat seeds. After discussion, it was proposed: (1) Past accounts were unclear and a general settlement would be made after the autumn harvest. From today onwards, a new account would be established. All male full and half laborers in the village, whether cadres or militia, aged between twelve and sixty, would be responsible for the duty of cultivating on behalf of military families. (2) Seven households of military and cadre families in the village who lack labor and have difficulties must be helped with an additional fourteen laborers and twenty-five livestock, according to the current need for wheat planting, to ensure timely planting. The responsibility should first be borne by those who have not served in the past. (3) 400 catties of wheat should be taken from the existing temple property and lent to households lacking wheat seeds for planting, to be returned after the autumn harvest. After these problems were solved, the wheat planting work immediately proceeded smoothly, and the masses were happy to cultivate on behalf of military families.\n\n　　[Taiyue Telegraph] After rectification and correction of deviations in Yicheng Nanma Village, the emotions of the masses from all strata have stabilized. This time, wheat planting has achieved \"deep plowing and abundant manure.\" Last year, only over one hundred mu of the village's eight hundred mu of wheat land was plowed twice, and the rest was planted after only one plowing. But this year, half of the eight hundred mu of land has been plowed three times, and half has been plowed four times, plowing deeply and finely. Last year, very little manure was applied, with an average of more than twenty loads of manure per mu, and more than two hundred mu of land was planted without manure. But this year, in addition to applying thatch and manure to the land, they also cut artemisia to make manure, bedded sheep, applied bean cake, mixed seeds with oil, and applied beans, with an average of about fifty loads of manure per mu, and even eighty loads per mu in some cases.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 翼城甘泉基点工作组　深入山庄解决种麦困难\n\n1948-09-28\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　翼城甘泉基点工作组\n  　深入山庄解决种麦困难\n    【太岳电】翼城三区甘泉基点工作组深入山庄，检查与解决了山庄种麦中的困难。甘泉行政村居民住得很分散，工作组为了解各山庄群众种麦困难，最近深入到各自然村进行检查，发现石佛等六个自然村有两个问题妨碍种麦。一是优军代耕非常混乱，闾长、民兵、农会执委都不服代耕勤务。二是有些贫农因为麦籽不够，还没种上。工作组随即召集各闾干部、小组长会议，讲解行署“服勤草案”中优军代耕办法，检讨代耕工作，开展批评，讨论如何解决代耕和麦种缺乏的问题。经过讨论，提出：（一）过去差帐不清，秋收后作一次总清算，从今天起另立新帐。全村无论干部、民兵，凡是十二岁以上六十岁以下的男全半劳力，一律分别负担优军代耕勤务。（二）全村七户没劳力有困难的军、干属，根据现在种麦需要，必须再帮人工十四个，牲口二十五个，使能保证按时种上。首先从过去没服勤的负担起。（三）从现存的庙产内拿出四百斤麦子，借给缺麦种的户种麦，秋后归还。这些问题解决后，种麦工作立即顺利进行，群众也就高兴代耕了。\n    【太岳电】翼城南马村经过整党纠偏，各阶层群众情绪安定，此次种麦做到了“犁深粪饱。”去年全村八百多亩麦地，犁两遍的才有一百多亩，其余都是一遍就种上了。但今年八百亩地，一半犁过了三遍，一半犁了四遍，犁的又深又细。去年上粪很少，平均每亩上粪二十多担，有二百多亩地没上粪就种上了。但今年除把茅粪地粪都上到地外，还割蒿沤粪、卧羊、上豆饼、油拌籽、上豆子等，平均每亩上粪约五十担，甚至有上八十担的。"

Its record of activities shows that it has committed many serious mistakes and made many decisions that have undermined the prestige of the United Nations. These mistakes are the result of American imperialism's deliberate attempt to turn the institution that guarantees international cooperation and world peace into a tool of Wall Street. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are fighting to defend the goals and ideals of the United Nations. If the enemies of international cooperation have not yet succeeded in completing their conspiracy, this is mainly due to the Soviet Union's unyielding policy of peace. All the commendable achievements of the United Nations have been obtained through the advocacy of the Soviet Union. The resolution of the First General Assembly on universal disarmament and the destruction of atomic weapons, as well as the resolution of last autumn's General Assembly condemning the instigators of a new war, were all proposed by Soviet representatives. The American imperialists, blinded by the concept of world hegemony, have shown astonishing clumsiness in learning historical lessons after the war. It can be expected that there will be new tricks in the Third General Assembly in order to achieve the goals that the United States has not yet achieved. Many signs indicate that the United States intends to put the United Nations to a new severe test, even at the risk of undermining the United Nations. Lie's report with ulterior motives is a sign. The democratic people of all countries will closely watch the proceedings of the Third General Assembly. They demand that the enemies of international cooperation be given appropriate counterattacks, and hope that the resolutions that have been passed will be implemented and that appropriate handling of urgent issues related to security will begin.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 联合国面临新的严重考验  美国还会有新的花样　必须予以适当的反击\n\n1948-09-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新时代评三届联大\n  　联合国面临新的严重考验\n    美国还会有新的花样\n  　必须予以适当的反击\n    【新华社陕北廿六日电】塔斯社讯：新时代周刊以“第三届联合国大会”为题发表社论称：联合国过去并未能符合爱好和平国家所寄予的希望。它的活动纪录显示：它曾犯了许多严重的错误，作出了许多破坏联合国威信的决定。这些错误的产生乃是美帝国主义立意将保障国际合作与世界和平的机构变为华尔街工具的结果。苏联和人民民主国家正为保卫联合国的目标与理想而奋斗。如果说国际合作的敌人至今还未能完成他们的阴谋，那么这主要地应归功于苏联不屈不挠的和平政策。联合国一切被人称誉的成绩，都是由于苏联的倡导而获得的。第一届大会关于普遍裁减军备及毁灭原子武器的决议及去秋大会关于谴责新战争挑拨者的决议，都是苏联代表所提出的。被世界霸权观念冲昏头脑的美帝国主义者，在战后学习历史教训中显得惊人的笨拙。可以预期，为了达到美国迄今还未成功的目的，第三届大会中还会有新的花样。许多迹象显示：美国打算把联合国置于新的严重考验中，甚至不惜冒使联合国垮台的危险。莱氏的别有用心的报告就是一种征候。一切国家的民主人民将密切注意第三届大会的议事。他们要求予国际合作的敌人以适当的反击，期望实行已通过的决议并对与安全有关的紧要问题开始作适当的处理。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, September 24th: TASS reports: The Finnish Communist Party's newspaper \"Työkansan Sanomat\" recently published an editorial exposing the increasingly reactionary nature of the Social Democratic cabinet headed by Fagerholm. The editorial stated: \"The activities of the Fagerholm cabinet prove that the Communist Party's assessment of this cabinet was justified from the very first day of its formation. Now, everyone can see that the Fagerholm government's task is to pave the way for reactionaries, and it is carrying out the will of the capitalists.\" The editorial summarized the government's reactionary activities during this period, stating: it is protecting capitalists from obtaining illegal profits from the manufacture of reparations goods; it is dismissing civil servants with democratic ideas and squeezing out democratic elements in the police agencies; it claims to be friendly to the Soviet Union, but this \"friendship\" was initially demonstrated by the release of the convicted war criminal Kivimäki. According to TASS, citing the French weekly \"Action\": Fagerholm held extremely secret talks with the US Ambassador to Finland, Warren, last month. The United States will lend Finland $150 million on the condition that Finland effectively participates in the Marshall Plan. It is said that Fagerholm has accepted this condition. As early as the beginning of August, shortly after the formation of the Fagerholm cabinet, Ms. Kuusinen, Chairman of the Finnish People's Democratic Union parliamentary group, analyzed this right-wing Social Democratic government, stating: \"Governments like this around the world represent a transition to a completely reactionary stage.\" However, she also pointed out with confidence: The People's Democratic Union \"will be able to rely on our supporters even more in the future than today.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS News: Soviet workers are enthusiastically launching a movement to reduce production costs and increase labor productivity, striving to exceed planned targets and increase socialist capital accumulation. This movement, along with the Soviet peasants' movement to complete and exceed grain delivery plans ahead of schedule, aims for the common goal of completing the Five-Year Plan in four years. Initiated by thirty-five leading factories in Moscow, this movement has spread throughout the Soviet Union at \"express speed\" (Pravda) and has become a mass movement. Economic leaders' conferences and workers' meetings are being held everywhere in Leningrad, the Urals, and the Donets Basin. Thousands of factories are setting ambitious goals day by day, guaranteeing to reduce costs and increase capital accumulation beyond planned targets. The creativity of workers, engineers, and technicians has been greatly enhanced by this powerful incentive. New inventions and rationalization proposals are being put forward everywhere to improve working methods, increase labor intensity, reduce non-productive expenses, and save raw materials, fuel, and electricity. Moscow industries originally planned to exceed capital accumulation targets by 1 billion rubles, but due to the movement's development, it has now been decided to increase this to 2 billion rubles. They are challenging workers across the country, calling on everyone to do the same. In this movement, the labor productivity of Moscow workers has now exceeded pre-war levels by 45.8 percent. Pravda published an editorial pointing out that \"this movement has great significance\" because it \"will not only enable the state to gain tens of billions of rubles to promote the revival and development of the national economy,\" but also clearly demonstrates \"the superior moral qualities of the Soviet people, their ardent patriotism, and their new spirit as members of a socialist society.\" Soviet newspapers are prominently publishing letters written to Stalin by workers participating in this movement. For example, textile workers, engineers, technicians, and staff in the Ivanovo Oblast guaranteed in a letter to Stalin that they would save 348 tons of cotton and 136 tons of yarn by the end of this year, thereby producing an additional 3 million meters of fabric. In addition, they guaranteed to reduce production costs by 40 million rubles. When publishing this news, Pravda also published an editorial to commend and encourage them.\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS News: The Soviet harvest and grain delivery plans are being successfully completed and exceeded ahead of schedule. As of September 10th, 86 percent of all grains have been harvested. Soviet newspapers have been prominently publishing letters from all collective farms and state farms in various republics, border regions, and states to Stalin, reporting on the completion of grain delivery plans. The Ukrainian Republic, known as the \"granary of Europe,\" completed its grain delivery plan ahead of schedule on September 3rd, one month and seven days earlier than last year, with total grain deliveries exceeding last year by 115 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin), exceeding 1940 by 33 million poods. All Ukrainian peasants have guaranteed to deliver at least an additional 31.6 million poods of grain and have challenged the collective farms and state farms in Siberia and the Far East to engage in socialist competition for exceeding grain delivery quotas. The Republics of Belarus and Moldova completed their grain delivery plans ahead of schedule in late August, with total grain deliveries exceeding last year by 34 million poods. All peasants in the two republics also guaranteed to deliver at least an additional 7.5 million poods of grain. In addition, all collective farms in the Moscow Oblast and many other states have completed their grain delivery plans ahead of schedule, with total grain deliveries exceeding not only last year but also 1940. Pravda pointed out in its commentary: \"The grain delivery movement vividly demonstrates the political consciousness of the Soviet peasants and the outstanding patriotic enthusiasm of the collective farmers to realize the post-war agricultural recovery and further development plan as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 苏工人展开减低成本提高生产运动　增加社会主义资本积累  农民争先纳粮力求进一步发展农业\n\n1948-09-28\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　苏工人展开减低成本提高生产运动\n  　增加社会主义资本积累\n    农民争先纳粮力求进一步发展农业\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联工人正热烈展开减低生产成本、提高劳动生产率，以争取超过计划增加社会主义资本积累的运动，与苏联农民提前完成并超过纳粮计划的运动同为争取五年计划四年完成的共同目标而努力。这一运动是由莫斯科三十五家首要工厂发起的，迅即以“特快的速度”（真理报）传遍全苏而成为群众性的运动。列宁格勒、乌拉尔、顿尼兹等地到处都举行了经济领导人员的大会与工人大会，成千的工厂一天多似一天地订出努力目标，保证超计划地减低成本、增加资本积累。工人、工程师、技师的创造性已因这一有力的激励而大大提高。各地提出新发明和合理化的建议，以求改进工作方法，增加劳动强度，减少非生产费用，节省原料、燃料与电力。莫斯科各工业本来预计超过计划资本积累十亿卢布，但由于运动的展开，现已决定增加至二十亿卢布，并向全国工人挑战，号召大家也这样做。在这一运动中莫斯科工人的劳动生产率，现在已超过战前水平百分之四十五点八。真理报特发表社论指出“这一运动具有伟大的意义”，因为它“不仅在于将使国家多得数十亿卢布以促进国民经济的复兴与发展”，还在于它明白显示了“苏维埃人民优越的道德品质，他们热诚的爱国主义，他们作为社会主义社会成员的新精神”。苏联各报均以显著的地位刊载参加这一运动的工人们给斯大林写的信。例如伊凡诺伏州纺织业工人、工程师、技师与职员在给斯大林的信中保证：在今年年底以前节省三百四十八吨棉花与一百三十六吨纱，以此来额外生产三百万公尺的织物，此外并保证减低生产成本四千万卢布。真理报在刊出这一消息时，并撰社论予以表扬与勉励。\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：苏联收获与纳粮计划正胜利提前完成并超过中。截至九月十日止，全部谷物已有百分之八十六收割完毕。苏联各报连日均以显著地位刊载各共和国、各边疆、各州全体集体农庄、国营农庄向斯大林报告完成纳粮计划的信件。号称“欧洲谷仓”的乌克兰共和国，已于九月三日先期完成纳粮计划，比去年早一个月又七天，纳粮总额超过去年一亿一千五百万普特（一普特合卅二点七六市斤），超过一九四○年三千三百万普特。乌克兰全体农民已保证至少再额外纳粮三千一百六十万普特，并向西伯利亚与远东的集体农庄与国营农庄提出挑战，进行超额纳粮的社会主义竞赛。白俄罗斯与摩达维亚两共和国，在上月下旬即已先期完成纳粮计划，纳粮总额超过去年三千四百万普特。两共和国全体农民还保证至少额外纳粮七百五十万普特。此外，莫斯科州与其他许多州的全体农庄，均已先期完成纳粮计划，纳粮总额不仅超过去年而且超过一九四○年。真理报特撰论指出：“纳粮运动生动地证明苏维埃农民的政治自觉性，与集体农民大众力求尽速实现战后农业复兴与进一步发展计划的卓越的爱国热忱。”"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 27th: The education cause in the Northeast Liberated Areas has achieved great development. According to recent preliminary statistics, there are currently 17,726 primary schools in the entire Northeast, an increase of 72.4% compared to the same period last year. The number of students is 1,688,446, an increase of 90.8% compared to last year. The number of primary school students in some provinces has increased by more than 150% compared to the puppet Manchukuo period. There are 125 middle schools, with 59,481 students and 2,229 teachers, an increase of 20 schools, 19,416 students, and 645 teachers compared to last year. In addition to those run by various provinces, there are more than ten institutions of higher learning, including the Northeast Academy of Sciences, Northeast University (formed by the merger of the original Northeast University and Jilin University), China Medical University, Military and Political University, Railway College, and Postal and Telecommunications School, with over 10,000 students. This tremendous achievement is the result of the democratic government's efforts to restore and develop school education and timely correct errors in its work. One of the main reasons for the sharp increase in the number of students is the economic and educational liberation of the laboring people. For example, the number of primary school students in Songjiang Province was 88,471 last year and 171,082 this year, an increase of 100%, the vast majority of whom are children of middle and poor peasants. Peasant cadre classes have been universally attached to middle schools in various places. In the past, very few middle school students came from poor peasant and farm laborer families, but according to statistics from Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, and Liaoning provinces, and Harbin city, they now account for 24.5% of the total. While the doors of schools were opened to the children of the laboring people, they did not refuse students from other family backgrounds to enroll. Leftist errors were once made on this issue, but they have been quickly corrected. The work of reforming the blind Kuomintang \"orthodox\" ideas of old students and teachers in Northeast schools has achieved great results in the past year. The vast majority of students and old teachers now have a basic stance of serving the people.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 东北　学生学校数目激增\n\n1948-09-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　东北\n  　学生学校数目激增\n    【新华社东北二十七日电】东北解放区教育事业已获得极大发展。据最近初步统计，全东北现有小学一万七千七百二十六所，较去年同时期增加百分之七十二点四。学生一百六十八万八千四百四十六人，较去年增加百分之九十点八。有些省份的小学生较伪满时增加一倍半以上。中学一百二十五所，学生五万九千四百八十一人，教员二千二百廿九人，比之去年，学校增加二十所，学生增加一万九千四百十六人，教员增加六百四十五人。专科以上学校除各省所办者外，现有东北科学院、东北大学（原东北大学与吉林大学合并而成）、中国医科大学、军政大学、铁路学院、邮电学校等十余处，学生万余名。这个巨大的成绩是民主政府努力恢复和发展学校教育并及时纠正工作中的错误的结果。学生人数激增的主要原因之一是劳动人民在经济上和教育上的解放。如松江省小学生去年为八八四七一名，今年为一七一零八二名，增加了一倍，其中绝大部分是中、贫农的子弟。各地中学校内，已普遍附设农民干部班。过去贫雇农家庭出身的中学生只有极少的一部分，现据松江、合江、嫩江、辽宁四省和哈尔滨市的统计，已占总数百分之二十四点五。当学校大门为劳动人民子弟开放的时候，它并不拒绝其他家庭成份的学生入学，在这个问题上曾经犯过左的错误，但已迅速纠正。改造东北学校中旧有学生和教员盲目的国民党“正统”观念的工作，在过去一年中收到了极大的成效。绝大部分学生和旧教员现在已经具有为人民服务的基本立场。"

On September 13th, at the beginning of the offensive, our army successively captured Changli city and the stations of Shimen, Anshan, Houfengtai, and Zhangzhuang on the Beining Railway line, annihilating most of the enemy's Hebei Security 21st Regiment and Guard 1st Regiment.

On the 19th, the enemy again concentrated its main force to attack Habo Town, more than 30 li northwest of Changli. After repeated hand-to-hand combat, we stopped the enemy in the area south of the town. At dusk, we launched a counterattack, defeating the enemy, who fled west of Tangshan overnight. By this time, the entire 130-li railway line from Tangshan to Liushouying was under our control. On the 20th, the enemy again attacked our positions north of Tangshan with a division's strength, launching more than ten assaults with fierce artillery fire, all of which were repelled by our army. At 4:00 on the 21st, our army counterattacked again, routing the enemy and capturing some of them. Preliminary statistics of the above battles show that our army annihilated a total of 3,045 enemy troops, including 904 killed or wounded and 2,141 captured.

    "title": "CCP Central Plains Bureau Propaganda Department: Instructions on Propaganda Work",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-29",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 26th—The Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Plains Bureau issued instructions on propaganda work on August 15th. The original text is as follows:\n\n　　(1) Although propaganda work has achieved some successes in the past, it has serious weaknesses. The main weakness is that our propaganda work has not been done well enough, and we have not conducted systematic ideological struggles with the enemy. There are many incorrect aspects in publicizing the Party's propositions and policies. There is a lack of sufficient investigation and research into the social conditions, the people's lives and ideological state in the Central Plains New District, and the enemy's propaganda activities. Therefore, the content of propaganda is often not fully in line with the actual situation in the New District and the demands of the people. Facts prove that because the New District has been under the rule and influence of the Kuomintang for a long time, because the general public does not know much about our Party, our army, and our propositions and policies, because the ideology and emotions of cadres and soldiers are prone to change after entering the New District, and because we are not familiar with many things in the New District and need good research and guidance, propaganda work must be particularly strengthened. We should educate the entire Party and army to become propaganda fighters, carry out propaganda work at all times and places, combine it with the local social situation and the people's lives, use facts and materials familiar to the masses, publicize the current situation and our propositions and policies, expose and combat the enemy's rumors and deceptions, establish their ideological positions in the New District, and liberate the masses from the influence of Kuomintang's arbitrary propaganda.\n\n　　(2) Based on the recent instructions from the Central Committee, the New China News Agency editorial, and the Central Bureau's \"66 Instructions,\" we have formulated the following general propaganda points. Various localities can refer to these points and formulate their own more specific propaganda guidelines based on the actual situation:\n\n　　A. Publicize that Chiang is bound to be defeated and we are bound to win, expose the fake peace conspiracy of the American imperialists and the Chinese reactionary group, and call for overcoming difficulties and striving for the nationwide victory of the People's Liberation War. Explain that any operational plan of the US-Chiang has failed, the overall strategy is in a passive state, Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary group have completely lost popular support, and are on the verge of final collapse. Our march into the Central Plains has great significance and has achieved great success. The complete liberation of the Central Plains is not far off. Although we may still have temporary and local difficulties, we should not underestimate the enemy in specific struggles, but we must not exaggerate the difficulties. Any difficulty can be overcome. We advocate peace and are willing to end the war as soon as possible. The civil war was created by the US-Chiang. Today, the American imperialists' fake peace conspiracy is only an attempt to allow the Kuomintang to gain a respite, reorganize its forces, and make a comeback. Without overthrowing the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and without allowing the aggressive forces of American imperialism to withdraw from China, China will not have true peace and democracy. American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and can be defeated. The war launched by the US imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek is a counter-revolutionary war. Our opposition to the US-Chiang is a people's liberation war, which has two different natures. Only the victory of the People's Liberation War can liberate the Chinese nation and the Chinese people. The New China News Agency’s editorial, \"A Summary of the Two Years of the People's Liberation War and the Tasks of the Third Year,\" should be widely and repeatedly publicized among the masses.\n\n　　B. Distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, combat the enemy's rumors and deception, and win over the masses. The Communist Party represents the people of the whole country, and the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government are the people's own army and government. They take the people's will as their will and strive for the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. Our basic proposition is to unite people from all walks of life to form an anti-American and anti-Chiang united front, overthrow the reactionary rule of the American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, and establish a democratic coalition government. All our policies, laws, and measures are for the benefit of the people. The Kuomintang, the Kuomintang army, and the Kuomintang government represent imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital. Their rule is the rule of a few warlords, bureaucrats, compradors, and landlords. They sell out the country to foreigners and oppress the people internally. They seize recruits, levy grain, impose taxes, extort and plunder, issue paper money indiscriminately, are corrupt and degenerate, and run rampant without regard to the law. Everything is for the benefit of a few people, forcing the majority of the people to be unable to live. The liberated areas and the Kuomintang areas are two societies and two systems, and the people's lives are fundamentally different. Kuomintang reactionaries spread rumors and slander against the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, distorting the policies and decrees of the democratic government. Their purpose is to undermine the people's own army and government, so that the people cannot turn over and continue to be subjected to their rule and oppression. We will definitely stand firm, the reactionary forces will definitely be defeated, and the world will definitely belong to the common people.\n\n　　C. Publicize the reasons for the current cessation of land reform and the implementation of rent reduction and interest reduction and reasonable burden. The current rent reduction and interest reduction is the first step in land reform and a preparatory step for the complete reform of the land system in the future. In areas where land reform has been implemented, the vested interests of farmers should be guaranteed, and landlords should not reverse the settlement, which can be promoted in accordance with the Yuxi Daily editorial \"Stop Land Reform and Implement Rent Reduction and Interest Reduction.\"\n\n　　D. Advocate eliminating bandits, opposing the Kuomintang reactionary forces, establishing democratic power, stabilizing social order, strictly implementing the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention, and protecting the people's lives and property. All those who do not oppose the People's Liberation Army and obey the laws of the democratic government shall be protected. Chiang's bandits and enemy personnel, except for those who have committed heinous crimes that must be punished, the rest of the coerced followers will be exempt from prosecution as long as they repent and reform themselves to the government, strictly enforce political integrity, be fair and just, save people's resources, reasonably share the burden, oppose theft and destruction, and reward agricultural and industrial production.\n\n　　E. Publicize the various policies stipulated in the Central Plains Bureau's June 6th instructions, especially the policies on bandits, reasonable burden, protecting cities, protecting industry and commerce, and winning over intellectuals. Explain the relationship between each policy and the people's interests, advocate contacting the masses, improving work style, conducting investigation and research, being hardworking and simple, and seeking benefits for the people. Proceed from reality in everything, and oppose the arbitrary application of old experiences regardless of time and place. Outside cadres must unite with local cadres, learn from each other's strengths and overcome weaknesses, and oppose arrogance and the bad work style of relying solely on administrative orders. Attention must be paid to cultivating activists among the local masses, and at the same time, outside cadres should strive to take root among the masses.\n\n　　F. Call on cadres to study the Party's line and policies, especially the policies for newly liberated cities and newly liberated areas, combine them with the local reality, resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies and the Central Plains Bureau's June 6th instructions, oppose independence from the Party's policies, and oppose the state of disorganization and indiscipline in which the system is not implemented, so that cadres become more politically mature and the Communist Party becomes stronger.\n\n　　In order to implement the above propaganda, all possible propaganda opportunities should be used to adopt various propaganda methods. For example: 1. Use the form of government announcements to publicly announce propositions and policies; 2. Use more oral propaganda, such as individual conversations, street speeches, disguised propaganda, dramas, singing, etc.; 3. Conference propaganda, various agencies and troops should regularly hold various symposiums and mass meetings, and make them a system; 4. Write slogans, slogans, leaflets, and publish bulletins and intelligence; 5. Publish newspapers and books, and use the New China Branch's news reports for propaganda; 6. Run various training classes and seminars, especially to hold symposiums and training classes for primary and secondary school teachers, etc., to absorb intellectuals to participate, publicize our propositions and policies to them, and spread them to the broad masses through them.\n\n　　(3) In order to strengthen propaganda work, the Party committees and columns of each district should improve their propaganda departments, first of all, establish and enrich the organization of the New China Branch or sub-branch in the short term, equip necessary cadres with radio stations and printing equipment, so that they can at least copy the broadcasts of the New China General Agency, and maintain regular contact with the Central Plains General Branch. The original propaganda cadres should be persuaded and assigned to propaganda work positions as much as possible. At the same time, new intellectuals should be absorbed in various forms, and they should be trained in short-term politics to become propaganda workers. Leading organs should have special personnel to take care of propaganda work regularly. District Party committees and column Party committees should hold regular meetings to specifically discuss propaganda guidelines and propaganda work issues.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 中共中原局宣传部　关于传宣工作的指示\n\n1948-09-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　中共中原局宣传部\n  　关于传宣工作的指示\n    【新华社中原二十六日电】中共中原中央局宣传部于八月十五日发出关于宣传工作的指示，原文如下：\n    （一）过去时期宣传工作虽有若干成绩，但存在严重弱点，主要的是我们的宣传工作做得很不够，没有系统的与敌人进行思想斗争。在宣传党的主张政策上，有许多不正确的地方。对中原新区的社会情况、群众的生活和思想状态，和敌人的宣传活动，缺乏充分的调查研究，因而宣传内容往往不完全切合新区实际和群众要求。事实证明：由于新区长期受国民党的统治和影响，由于一般群众对我党我军和我们的主张政策不很了解，由于干部和战士进入新区以后思想情绪容易发生变化，也由于我们对新区许多事情不熟悉，需要很好研究与指导，宣传工作必须特别加强。应该教育全党全军，人人都成为宣传战士，随时随地进行宣传工作，结合当地的社会情况和群众生活，运用群众熟悉的事实材料，宣传目前形势和我们的主张政策，揭发和打击敌人的造谣欺骗，确立他们在新区群众的思想阵地，使群众从国民党的武断宣传的影响下解放出来。\n    （二）我们根据最近中央指示和新华社社论以及中央局六六指示，规定如下一般的宣传要点，各地可以参照这个要点，根据当地的实际情况，规定自己更具体的宣传方针：\n    甲、宣传蒋必败，我必胜，揭发美帝及中国反动集团的假和平阴谋，号召克服困难，争取人民解放战争的全国胜利。说明美蒋任何作战计划均告失败，全盘战略处于被动，蒋介石及其反动集团完全丧失人心，已到最后崩溃边缘。我进军中原，具有伟大意义，且已获得很大成就，中原的全部解放已为期不远。我们虽尚可能有暂时的局部的困难，不应在具体斗争中轻敌，但也决不可夸大困难，任何困难均可克服。我们向主和平，现在也愿赶快结束战争，内战是美蒋造成的，但今天美帝国主义的假和平的阴谋，只是企图使国民党获得喘息，重整兵力，卷土重来。不推翻国民党反动统治，不使美帝国主义侵略势力退出中国，中国就不会有真正的和平民主。美帝和各国反动派外强中干，是可以战胜的。美帝及其走狗蒋介石所发动的是反革命战争，我们反对美蒋，是人民解放战争，具有两种不同性质。只有人民解放战争胜利，中华民族和中国人民才能得到解放。新华社“人民解放战争两周年的总结和第三年的任务”的社论，应全部在群众中广泛并反复宣传。\n    乙、分清敌我界限，打击敌人造谣欺骗，争取群众。共产党代表全国人民，解放军、民主政府是人民自己的军队和政府，以人民的意志为意志，为中国人民和中华民族而奋斗。我们的基本主张是：联合各阶层人民组成反美反蒋统一战线，推翻美帝及其走狗蒋介石的反动统治，成立民主联合政府。我们的一切政策、法令、措施，都是为人民谋利益的。国民党、国民党军队和国民党政府，是代表帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的，他们的统治是少数军阀、官僚、大买办、大地主统治，对外出卖祖国，对内压迫人民。他们抓丁拉夫，征粮派款，敲诈掠夺，滥发纸币，贪污腐化，横行不法，一切为少数人利益而迫使大多数人民无法生活，解放区和国民党区是两个社会，两个制度，人民生活根本不同，国民党反动分子造谣诬蔑共产党和解放军；歪曲民主政府的政策法令，其目的在破坏人民自己的军队和政府，使人民不能翻身，继续受他们的统治和压迫。我们一定站得住，反动势力一定被打垮，天下一定是老百姓的。\n    丙、宣传目前停止土改实行减租减息和合理负担的原因和理由。现在的减租减息是土地改革的第一步，是将来彻底改革土地制度的准备步骤。凡已实行土改的地方，保障农民既得利益，地主不应倒算，可照豫西日报社论“停止土改实行减租减息”宣传。\n    丁、提倡肃清土匪，反对国民党反动势力，建立民主政权，安定社会秩序，严格执行三大纪律，八项注意，保护人民生命财产。凡不反对解放军并服从民主政府法令者，一律予以保护。蒋党土匪和敌方人员，除罪大恶极分子必须惩办者外，其余胁从分子，只要向政府悔过自新，一律免予追究，厉行政治廉洁公正，节省民力，合理负担，反对偷盗破坏，奖励农工生产。\n    戊、宣传中原局六月六日指示所规定的各项政策，其中尤其是对土匪政策，合理负担政策，保护城市、保护工商业政策，和争取知识分子政策，说明每一政策与人民的利益关系，提倡联系群众，改进作风，调查研究，艰苦朴素，为民谋利。一切从实际出发，反对不问时间、地点任意套用老经验。外来干部必须和本地干部团结，互相取长补短，反对自高自大及专靠行政命令的坏作风。必须注意培养当地群众中的积极分子，同时外来干部应力求在群众中生根。\n    己、号召干部学习党的路线政策，尤其是新解放城市和新解放地区的政策，结合当地实际，坚决贯彻党中央的方针政策和中原局六月六日指示，反对对于党的政策闹独立性，和不执行制度的无组织无纪律状态，使干部在政治上更加成熟，共产党更加强大。\n    为贯彻上述宣传，应利用一切可能的宣传机会采取各种各样的宣传方法。例如：一、运用政府布告形式，公开宣布主张政策；二、多用口头宣传，如个别谈话，街头讲演，化装宣传，演剧、唱歌等；三、会议宣传，各机关部队均应经常召开各种座谈会和群众大会，并把他订为一种制度；四、书写标语、口号、传单、出刊捷报情报；五、出版报纸书籍，并利用新华分社新闻报道进行宣传；六、开办各种训练班、讲习所、尤其要举行中小学教员的座谈会和训练班等，吸收知识分子参加，向他们宣传我们的主张政策，通过他们传播到广大群众中去。\n    （三）为了加强宣传工作，各区党委和纵队都应健全自己的宣传部门，首先在短期内把新华分社或支社的组织建立和充实起来，配备必要干部设置电台和印刷器材，做到至少能抄收新华总社的广播，并和中原总分社保持经常联络。原来的宣传干部，应尽量说服和分配他们到宣传工作岗位上来，同时应用各种形式吸收新的知识分子，经过短期政治训练，培养他们成为宣传工作人员。领导机关应有专人经常照顾宣传工作。区党委和纵队党委，应定期会议，专门讨论宣传方针和宣传工作问题。"

    "content": "Concretely Solve Production Difficulties\n  　Yuci New District Eliminates Wasteland and Sows Wheat\n    [Jinzhong Electric] The bandit Yan caused famine for 20% of the total population and wasteland accounting for 25% of the total land area in Yuci. After the liberation of the entire Yuci territory, the democratic government immediately began mobilizing the masses to restore production, organize self-salvation through production, eliminate wasteland, and rush to sow winter wheat. They put forward the slogan: \"Sow more, sow early, and sow quickly; early is better than late; sow more wheat this year, and you won't go hungry next year.\" It was determined that whoever sows this year will reap next year, and every cadre was called upon to conduct in-depth propaganda and mobilization to dispel the masses' concerns about sowing but not being able to eat what they harvest. In order to solve production difficulties, the county government allocated 300 shi of wheat to help military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and poor peasants solve the seed problem. During the tense wasteland elimination and wheat sowing movement in the first half of September, county and district cadres went deep into various villages to publicize the Party's land policy and burden policy, achieving considerable results. For example, in the process of mobilizing and organizing the masses to sow wheat in the 4th and 6th districts, initially, the peasants did not understand our land policy and burden policy and dared not produce boldly. The cadres of the district immediately focused on publicizing the abolition of \"soldier-peasant integration,\" clarifying that peasant land belongs to the original owners, and affirming that whoever sows this year will reap next year, and that households with no or little land can have land adjusted from the land occupied by Yan's puppet personnel and public temples. This stabilized the people's hearts, and the masses felt that production was guaranteed, and their enthusiasm greatly increased. Donghao Village in the 4th District has now cultivated 410 mu, accounting for half of the original wheat land. Xihhao has cultivated 220 mu, accounting for 60% of the total wheat land. Central Village in the district, which has more errands, has cultivated 360 mu of its 800 mu of wheat land and is now rushing to sow. Chenkan Village in the 6th District, in addition to finishing sowing the existing 2,164 mu of wheat land, has eliminated mature wasteland and increased wheat land by 150 mu. In the process of restoring production and sowing wheat, the government appropriately adjusted a certain amount of wheat land for military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and poor peasants with no or little land, and tried to solve the difficulties of labor and animal power. For example, launching freely combined small-scale mutual aid teams. Xishagou Village in the 1st District has 170 households, some of which cannot cultivate due to lack of livestock, so they organized mutual assistance between households with livestock and households without livestock, stipulated conditions, and specified that plowing one mu of land is equivalent to overpaying three jin of wheat. In this way, both parties are willing and both benefit. All 30 head of cattle in the village cultivated more than 1,500 mu of land in a sudden attack in ten days. Now they are starting to rush to sow winter wheat. When peasants have difficulties with wheat, they are organized to think of their own solutions, combined with leadership assistance. For example, the 6th District uses various relatives and friends to care for flexible mutual assistance. The 9th District uses fruit trees to buy wheat seeds. The district government also lent the grain left by the enemy to the masses. In addition, they paid attention to the close integration of production and support for the front. Organize all labor to participate in wheat sowing. For example, women in Niedian Village in the 8th District all went to the fields, so that men's participation in the war did not affect production. Of the 1,200 mu of wheat land in the whole district, more than 700 mu have been cultivated. The remaining 400 mu are planned to be cultivated completely in seven days.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 具体解决生产困难　榆次新区灭荒种麦\n\n1948-09-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　具体解决生产困难\n  　榆次新区灭荒种麦\n    【晋中电】阎匪给榆次造下占全人口百分之二十的饥民，占总地亩百分之二十五的荒地。榆次全境解放后，民主政府立即着手发动群众恢复生产，组织生产自救，消灭荒地，抢种宿麦。提出“多种早种快种，赶早不赶晚，今年多种麦，明年不饿肚”的口号。确定今年谁种明年谁收，号召每个干部深入宣传动员，解除群众怕种上吃不上的顾虑。为了解决生产困难，县府拨出三百石小麦帮助军干烈属及贫苦农民解决种子问题。在九月上半月紧张的灭荒种麦运动中，县区干部深入各村宣传党的土地政策与负担政策，获得相当成果。如四、六区在发动与组织群众种麦当中，起初农民对我土地政策与负担政策不摸底，不敢大胆生产；该区干部即抓紧宣传废除“兵农合一”，农民土地归原主、肯定说明今年谁种明年谁收，无地少地户可由阎伪人员霸占土地及公庙产中调剂。这样安定了民心，群众觉得生产有了保障，情绪大为提高。四区东郝村现已耕过四百一十亩，占原种麦地一半。西郝已耕过二百二十亩，占总麦地的百分之六十。该区差务较多的中部村，八百亩麦地，已耕过三百六十亩，现正抢种。六区陈侃村除将现有麦地二千一百六十四亩种完外，另消灭熟荒增加麦地一百五十亩。恢复生产与种麦中，政府适当的给无地少地的军干烈属及贫苦农民调剂了一定的麦地，并设法解决劳畜力困难。如发动自由组合的小型变工。一区西沙沟村一百七十户，有些户因没有牲口不能耕种，即组织有牲口户和无牲口户互助，订出条件，规定耕一亩地顶超资麦三斤。这样双方都自愿，也都得到利益，全村三十犋牲口，十天中即突击耕地一千五百余亩。现开始抢种宿麦。农民麦子困难，即组织群众自己想办法，结合领导上的帮助。如六区是利用各种亲朋关心机动互济。九区用果木变买麦种。区政府也将敌人遗留下的粮食借给群众。此外，他们注意了生产支前密切结合。组织所有劳力参加种麦。如八区聂店村妇女一齐上地，使男人参战不影响生产。全区麦地一千二百亩，现已耕种七百多亩。剩下四百亩，计划七日全部耕种完。"

    "title": "Initial Achievements in Cadre Study in Central Hebei: Improved Work After Study",
    "author": "",
    "date": "1948-09-29",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "[Hebei News] The Central Hebei District Party Committee has been organizing the study of four major documents since late June: the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau's designated \"Current Tasks in the Liberated Areas of North China,\" the CCP Central Committee's \"Instructions on Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948,\" the Propaganda Department's \"Reprint of the Preface and Text of Chapter Two of 'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder,\" and \"Lenin on How Soviet Government Employees Should Work.\" The study lasted two months, ending around August 20. The study was better in the directly subordinate organs of the Central Hebei level, most of the directly subordinate organs of the Ninth Sub-district, and in Li County, Gaoyang, Qingyuan, Hejian City, Hejian County, Renhe, Qing County, and Shen County. Among them, the various departments of the Administrative Office (行署) gained the most, checking and improving the work of the organs according to the spirit of the documents. The inspection revealed the following problems: (1) Backlog and delay in work. For example, the Civil Affairs Department of the Administrative Office had not issued a new method of land cultivation on behalf of others from this spring to the present. The appointments of eight new county heads in the Eleventh Sub-district had not been announced for a long time after they took office. The Education Department's opinions on the education work of the refugee camps in the Tenth Sub-district could have been issued after a review, but it was delayed from May to the present. The Finance Department's grain depot had grain coupons in arrears for four or five months that could not be reimbursed. The price list of goods had not been updated for several months. The Xingde General Store of the Central Hebei Trading Company shelved its business plan without studying its implementation for a month. (2) Lack of division of labor and clear responsibilities. Generally, the work of the departments in various organs lacked scientific division of labor, resulting in uneven workloads between units and departments, and between cadres within departments, with some work unattended. For example, the various departments of the Administrative Office found that the division of labor between the Secretary's Office and the various sections was unclear. The Secretary's Office was busy all day, while some comrades in the sections had nothing to do. The Research Office of the District Party Committee was also very busy in the previous stage, often working late into the night, while those who were idle could read novels. As a result, the work was often in a passive state of response, unable to promote the strength of all cadres and organizations to solve problems in a planned and step-by-step manner, but only dealt with them individually and temporarily, reducing work efficiency. (3) Careless and perfunctory work attitude and methods. The Accounting Section of the Finance Department of the Administrative Office wrote 1.2 million catties for 120,000 catties of old inventory grain. Bo County reported 400,000 catties of grain stored as 40,000 catties, and then instructed the Eleventh Sub-district to transfer it, resulting in a serious waste of manpower and material resources. In other cases, some comrades in the Editorial Section of the Guide (导报) did not consider the consequences of revising drafts, revised them as soon as they picked up a pen, and did not review them after the revision, and did not give enough consideration to policies. A careless and perfunctory work attitude was quite common among cadres at all levels. Generally, there was a lack of strict inspection systems from superiors to subordinates. (4) Failure to observe time. This was particularly evident in meetings. Many gatherings of cadres often spent more time waiting for people than the official meeting time.\n\nThe reasons for these phenomena are primarily the lack of systems and scientific division of labor in the work, and the failure to earnestly implement inspections. Therefore, even if errors are discovered, it is difficult to investigate responsibility and correct errors, allowing the phenomena of carelessness, delay, irresponsibility, and non-implementation of resolutions in the work to develop and grow. Secondly, it is due to the individualism and liberalism in the minds of the cadres. These were also appropriately exposed and criticized in the work inspection.\n\nAfter studying the documents and inspecting the work, the organs generally established systems and studied methods to improve the work. In the various departments and sections of the Administrative Office and the Secretary's Office, the various enterprise departments of Central Hebei, as well as the Public Security Bureau, the District Party Committee, and other organs, in the county party committees of Qing County, Hejian, Gaoyang, Renhe, Shen County, and other counties, as well as the governments of Shen County and Hejian, the Anguo Flag Pharmaceutical Factory, and other places, scientific division of labor was started, and various systems were established: meeting system, reporting system, and timely answers to questions from below. For example, the Gaoyang County Party Committee stipulated a work reporting system for county and district party committees, and some districts have already reported to the county party committee once every three days. And began to overcome the tendency of the district party committee not doing party affairs work in action. Most departments have made work plans and established work logs, striving to complete the work of the day on the same day. Some organs, such as the various departments of the Administrative Office, even sacrificed lunch breaks and rest to deal with past backlogs. After studying, the Anguo Flag Pharmaceutical Society improved the leadership of the organs, and the production volume of workers increased greatly. In the past, each medicine-cutting worker could cut six or seven catties of medium-quality herbs and eleven or twelve catties of coarse herbs per day. Now, they cut an average of thirteen to sixteen catties of medium-quality herbs and thirty to sixty catties of coarse herbs per day. The efficiency of counting tickets in the Ninth Sub-district Bank has increased by one-third. After this inspection and transformation movement, the work, study, and life of most organs have become more intensive and regular than in the past, the work efficiency has improved a step, and the enthusiasm of cadres has generally increased.\n\nFrom the two-month study movement in Central Hebei District, the following major experiences can be drawn:\n\nUnified Leadership of Branch and Administration\n\n(1) The unified leadership of the branch and the administration is the first key to doing a good job in study, which is primarily determined by the serious attention and personal organization of cadre study by the administrative responsible cadres of each organ, regarding leadership of study as one of the main tasks of their own ideological leadership. Wherever the branch can unify leadership with the administration, with the head being responsible and personally organizing the leadership of cadre study, the study will definitely be sustained, and the results of the study will inevitably become practical actions to inspect and improve the work. For example, Director Luo of the Administrative Office and Director Song of the Finance Department, Director Zhang of the Agriculture and Forestry Department, and other department directors, the administrative responsible cadres of the Public Security Bureau and Central Hebei Trading Company, and the Party Committees of Li County, Hejian, Shen County, Gaoyang, and Qing County were able to personally lead the study and listen to reports. The Shen County Party Committee Secretary personally went to various departments every day to inspect the study, organize reports, and answer questions. The results of the study in these places were great. Conversely, wherever the branch and the administration cannot unify leadership, and the administration believes that study hinders work, and the responsible cadres do not participate in the study leadership, causing the branch leadership to fall into an isolated state, the study will inevitably not be done well. For example, in the early days of the Central Hebei Public Security Bureau and some county party committees, they regarded themselves as special and always thought they were busy and could be an exception, and therefore could not turn the study into a upsurge of improving work.\n\nLeading Cadres Setting an Example\n\n(2) Leading cadres being able to set an example and influence cadres with their own exemplary role in study is the second important condition for doing a good job in study. Especially in the initial stage of leading the actual inspection work, if leading cadres can humbly examine themselves, the development of the study movement and work inspection will inevitably be rapid and avoid detours. Because this can: First, promote the development of criticism and self-criticism; Second, provide cadres with specific methods of connecting with reality. This experience is extremely obvious in the Central Hebei Administrative Office.\n\nClarifying the Purpose and Method of Study\n\n(3) In each stage of study, the leadership must clarify the main purpose of study and put forward specific requirements. In the initial stage of this study, due to the lack of clarity in the purpose and method of study by the leadership, only general indications were given to examine oneself in the spirit of the documents and carry out criticism and self-criticism, resulting in two deviations: One was the formal, mechanical, and trivial connection with reality, confined to the surface words and phrases of the documents, making the study dry and uninteresting, and unable to go deep. The other was that the problems connected were very broad: individualism, liberalism, bureaucracy, corruption, status concepts, arrogance, marriage problems, everything; the main method of study was individual reporting in groups, the problems were extremely broad, lacking a central purpose, and unable to go deep. At the joint meeting of the directly subordinate organs branch propaganda departments on July 30, the Central Hebei level emphasized that the purpose of the study was: \"To improve the work of the organs, improve work efficiency, and initially establish scientific work methods and systems.\" For individuals, it was to overcome carelessness, perfunctory delays, lack of enthusiasm and lack of organization and discipline. The method of study was to focus on the main problems of the various departments after initially seeking unified understanding of the documents, and individual reflection should revolve around the work of the departments. At the same time, it was further emphasized that the standard for checking the quality of study should be the actual effect of work improvement. In this way, the blindness and formalism in the study leadership of some organs were overcome.\n\nStarting from Specific Objects\n\n(4) It is necessary to start from specific objects and classify according to cultural and political level and work experience in order to overcome generalization and formalism. In this study, the Central Hebei divided the study groups into three levels: Level A was for cadres above the county section chief level with higher cultural and political levels, focusing on self-study and supplemented by casual talks and group discussions. Level B was for general cadres at the district level, with responsible comrades giving reports on the spirit of the documents, combined with collective discussion. Level C was for service personnel, mainly attending large classes in shifts. This method is good, but in addition to studying by level, the responsible cadres of each small unit (such as section chiefs, section heads, and ministers of the Party Committee, etc.) should return to their department, section, or office at a certain time to listen to the opinions of general cadres on study and work, or conduct self-criticism in their unit, adopting a method of concentrating on studying problems in groups from time to time and discovering problems in departments, sections, and offices from time to time.\n\nCorrectly Using Study Tests\n\n(5) The correct and timely use of study tests can play a role in encouraging and criticizing cadre study. Many cadres felt ashamed because of poor test results and then grasped the study tightly. After testing in Shen County, Hejian, Renqiu, Li County, Qingyuan, and other counties, the enthusiasm of cadres for study generally increased. When testing, the leadership must pay attention to grasping the following issues so that the test does not go astray: (1) Testing cannot become the main method of leading study. Simply emphasizing testing is prone to formalistic deviations. The most important thing is still to rely on constantly strengthening the ideological leadership and organizational leadership of study. (2) The test must be linked to reality. The questions should be based on the current policies of the Party, with concrete work and important political and current affairs common sense as the content, in order to help cadres further understand the policies of the Party and how to implement them in concrete work. Avoid asking questions that are divorced from the current reality of work, only remember nouns and numbers, or talk empty big truths, which will make cadres move towards a dogmatic method of study. (3) After the test, the results must be summarized and announced immediately, analyzing various correct and incorrect understandings and ideological problems in the test. In the evaluation, those comrades who originally had very low cultural and political levels but studied hard and made rapid progress should be given encouragement, and their efforts should not be erased. Finally, the test should be linked to the actual actions of the cadres and the results of the implementation of policies, and attention should be paid at all times to correcting and preventing the incorrect attitude of studying not for work but for testing.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 冀中干部学习初获成绩　经过学习工作提高\n\n1948-09-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　冀中干部学习初获成绩\n  　经过学习工作提高\n    根据文件精神切实检查工作\n  　两月来学习中的主要经验：\n    【冀中讯】冀中区党委自六月下旬布置学习华北局宣传部指定之“华北解放区的当前任务”“中共中央关于一九四八年土改工作与整党工作的指示”，中宣部“重印左派幼稚病第二章前言”及本文，“列宁论苏维埃机关工作人员应如何工作”等四大文件以来，历时两月，到八月二十日左右结束。各处学习以冀中级直属机关，九分区大多数直属机关及蠡县、高阳、清苑、河间市、河间县、任河、青县、深县等较好。其中尤以行署各厅收获较好，根据文件精神检查与改善机关工作。在检查中发现了以下的问题：（一）工作上的积压与拖延，如行署民政厅对一个新的代耕办法，从今春延至现在还未发出。十一分区八个新县长就职很久，未通令加委。教育厅对十分区难民收容所的教育工作意见，本来审查一下就可以发出。但却从五月拖延到现在。财厅粮库积压粮票四五个月没法报销。实物价目数月不加清理。冀中贸易公司的兴德总店将业务计划搁置起来，不研究执行，直压了一个月。（二）缺乏分工与明确职责。一般机关部门的工作都缺乏科学分工，致使各单位与部门之间，部门中干部之间忙闲不一，某些工作则无人管理。如行署各厅都检查出秘书室与各科分工不清，秘书室成天很忙，而某些科内同志无事可作。区党委研究室前一阶段也是忙的经常开夜车，闲的可以看小说，因此，影响工作经常处于被动应付状态，不能推动全体干部与各个组织力量，有计划有步骤的解决问题，而只是零星琐碎的去个别处理，和临时应付，降低了工作效率。（三）粗枝大叶潦草的工作态度与方法。行署财政厅会计科把旧库存粮十二万斤写成一百二十万斤。博野县存粮四万斤，报告为四十万斤，后指示十一分区去调运，结果严重浪费了人力物力。其他如导报编辑科有些同志改稿不考虑，提笔就改，改后也不审查，对政策慎重考虑不够。潦草与粗枝大叶的工作态度在各级干部中相当普遍存在。上对下一般都缺乏严格的检查制度。（四）不遵守时间。这特别表现在开会上。干部中好多集会往往等人的时间比正式会议的时间还要长。\n    这些现象产生的原因首先主要是由于工作上缺乏制度与科学分工，不能认真执行检查，因而即使发现错误亦难追究责任，纠正错误，使工作中的潦草、拖延、不负责任、不执行决议等现象得以发展滋长。其次，是由于干部中的个人主义与自由主义思想。这些，在工作检查中也作了适当的揭露与批评。\n    经过文件学习和工作检查以后，各机关都较普遍的建立了制度，研究了改进工作的方法。在行署各厅各科与秘书室、冀中各企业部门，以及公安局、区党委等机关，在青县、河间、高阳、任河、深县等县委机关，以及深县、河间政府、安国旗帜药厂等处，都着手进行科学分工，规定了各种制度：会议制度，汇报制度，并及时答复下面的问题。如高阳县委规定了县区委工作汇报制度，有的区已做到三天向县委报告一次。并开始从行动上克服区委不作党务工作的偏向。多数部门都作了工作计划，建立了工作日志，争取当天工作当天完成。有的机关，如行署各厅为处理过去积压工作，甚至牺牲了午睡和休息。安国旗帜药社学习后改善了机关领导，工人生产量大增。过去每个切药工人每天切中货六、七斤，粗货十一、二斤，现在中货每天平均切十三斤到十六斤，粗货卅多斤到六十多斤。九分区银行点票效率提高了三分之一。经过这一个检查与改造运动之后，大多数机关的工作、学习、生活都比过去紧张正规了，工作效率提高了一步，干部积极性普遍增长。\n    从冀中区两个月来的学习运动中，可以得出以下几点主要的经验：\n    支部行政统一领导\n    （一）支部与行政领导的统一是学习搞好的第一个关键，而这又首先决定于各机关行政负责干部认真重视与亲自组织干部学习，把领导学习看作自己思想领导的主要工作之一。凡是支部能与行政上统一领导，由首长负责，亲自动手组织领导干部学习的，学习就一定能坚持，学习的结果必然成为检查与改进工作的实际行动。如行署罗主任及财政厅宋厅长、农林厅张厅长等各厅厅长，公安局、冀中贸易公司的行政负责干部和蠡县、河间、深县、高阳、青县的党委，都能亲身领导学习，听取汇报。深县县委书记每天还亲自到各部门去检查学习，组织报告，和解答问题。这些地方的学习成绩就大。反之，凡是支部与行政不能统一领导，行政上认为学习妨碍工作，负责干部又不参加学习领导，使支部领导陷于孤立状态，则学习必然搞不好，如冀中公安局初期，及某些县委自视特殊，总以为自己忙，可以例外，因而便不能把学习造成为改进工作的热潮。\n    领导干部以身作则\n    （二）领导干部能以身作则，以自己的学习模范作用影响干部，是搞好学习的第二个重要条件，尤其在领导实际检查工作的初期，领导干部如能虚心检讨自己，学习运动和工作检查的开展必然很快，而且少走弯路。因为，这样可以：第一、推动开展批评与自我批评；第二、提供干部联系实际的具体方法，这个经验在冀中行署极为明显。\n    明确学习目的方法\n    （三）在各个学习阶段，领导必须明确学习的主要目的，提出具体要求。这次学习的初期，由于领导上对学习目的方法不够明确，只是一般的指出以文件精神检讨自己，开展批评与自我批评，因而发生两种偏向：一个是形式的机械而琐碎的联系实际，拘限于文件的表面字句，使学习干燥无味，不能深入。另一个是联系问题非常广泛：个人主义、自由主义、官僚主义、贪污腐化、地位观念、自高自大、婚姻问题应有尽有；学习方法主要是个人在小组报告，问题极广，缺乏中心目的，不能深入。冀中级在七月三十日直属机关支宣联席会上就强调提出学习目的是：“改进机关工作，提高工作效能，初步建立科学的工作方法与制度。”对个人则是克服粗枝大叶，潦草拖延，不积极不热情及无组织无纪律状态。学习方法是在初步求得文件统一认识之后，以检查各部门的主要问题为主，个人反省则应围绕部门工作。同时更强调检查学习的好坏应以工作改进的实际效果为标准。这样，才克服了某些机关学习领导上的盲目性与形式主义。\n    从具体对象出发\n    （四）必须从具体对象出发，按文化政治水平和工作经验分级，才能克服一般化与形式主义。冀中在这次学习小组共分三级，甲级是文化政治水平较高的县科长以上干部，以自学阅读为主，辅以漫谈和小组讨论。乙级为区级一般干部，由负责同志作关于文件精神的报告，结合集体讨论。丙级为勤杂人员，主要是分班上大课。这种方法是好的，但除按级学习外，各小单位负责干部（如科长、股长、党委的部长等），在一定时间应回到本部门、科、室，听取一般干部对学习和工作的竟见，或在本单位进行检讨，采取时而按组集中研究问题，时而到部、科、室发现问题的方法。\n    正确利用学习测验\n    （五）正确的适时的利用学习测验，对干部学习可起鼓励与批评的作用，好些干部因测验成绩不好，觉着丢人，以后就抓紧学习了。在深县、河间、任邱、蠡县、清苑等县经测验之后，干部学习情绪普遍提高。在测验时领导上必须注意掌握以下问题，不使测验走了偏向：（一）测验不能成为领导学习的主要方法，单纯的强调测验，就易犯形式主义的偏向。最重要的仍赖于经常加强学习的思想领导与组织领导。（二）测验必须与实际联系，出题要根据当前党的各种方针政策，以具体工作与重要的政治时事常识为内容，以帮助干部进一步了解党的政策与在具体工作中如何贯彻。切忌出些脱离当前工作实际，光记名词数字或空讲大道理的题目，那会使干部走向教条主义的学习方法。（三）测验之后，必须即时总结宣布成绩，分析测验中各种正确与不正确认识与思想问题。评判中对原来文化政治水平很低，但学习努力，进步很快的同志，要给他们以鼓励，不要抹煞了他们的努力。最后要把测验与干部的实际行动以及执行政策的结果联系起来，时时注意纠正与防止不是为工作乃是为测验而学习的不正确态度。"

    "content": "(Editor's note: The above situation is caused by serious bureaucracy; now the leadership has examined the bureaucracy and stipulated future guidelines and methods, which is very good. However, it is not enough to abstractly propose a sentence of \"solving legacy issues\" for past problems. Various methods should be specifically discussed and resolved thoroughly and completely, otherwise it will be difficult to eliminate.)\n\n[Beiyue News] In order to implement the spirit of the District Party Committee's Financial Committee's \"Instructions on Thoroughly Investigating Grain Depots and Strengthening Grain Management,\" the Fourth Special Administrative Office convened a meeting of grain depot directors from various counties in early this month, and discovered serious chaos in grain and fodder work. Li Laomu, a cadre from the Nanjicheng sub-depot of Lingshou, village head Li Shuzhen, and veteran preferential treatment committee member Shang Laohui privately borrowed 1,280 catties of wheat and 121 catties of corn to open a store to make money. Li Laomu also lent his younger brother 820 catties of wheat. From then on, the grain gate was wide open. No matter whether cadres or the masses encountered happy or sad events, festivals, temple fairs, eating, clothing, opening stores, buying livestock, or treating patients, they could borrow public grain. A total of more than 30 households borrowed 12,534 catties of wheat, 1,647 catties of cotton, and 629 catties of millet. This spring, when the government levied funds, the director of the poor peasant league, the director of the farmers' association, the village head, and the branch secretary of Beijicheng saw the disparity in the rice funds and arbitrarily levied grain, which was then sold to pay the funds. A total of 8,417 catties of millet and 4,537 catties of beans were levied, with a total selling price of 3,294,360 yuan. 2,054,418 yuan was handed over to the district, with a net profit of 1,239,941 yuan. Except for the existing 141,000 yuan in silver, another 256,300 yuan was handed over to the district, and 539,600 yuan in silver was used to repair waterwheels, the remaining 303,011 yuan was wasted and squandered. The two responsible cadres of the Mengjiatuo Village Poor Peasants League and the New Farmers' Association privately sold 1,060 catties of public grain, and colluded with other village cadres, a total of 14 people, to jointly sell 1,995 catties of public grain rice, totaling more than 300,000 yuan in silver, which was distributed among themselves. Village head Meng Jixiang stole 140 catties of rice, and privately sold 400 catties of rice, earning 80,000 yuan in silver. The village head, deputy village head, director of the New Farmers' Association, and finance committee member used public grain for trading, earning more than 700,000 yuan in silver. Last winter, when Baimagang Village levied funds, the government set the price at 140 yuan per catty of rice, but the village collected it at 200 yuan per catty. In the end, 1,018 catties of surplus rice was not returned to the masses. 567 catties were used to offset the old public grain, 336 catties were used for education rice, and the rest was all wasted by the cadres. Last year, during the Spring Festival, the poor peasant league of Gangbei Village proposed eating tofu for the New Year and borrowed 2,000 catties of public grain. The poor people's league of Dongtazikou Village in Zhengding randomly borrowed 700,000 yuan of public funds, the village office used 1,000 catties of public grain, and the cooperative used more than 1,000 catties of public grain and more than 100,000 yuan of public funds (approved by the District Committee). During the levy, the village levied 55,000 catties of public grain, but only handed over 42,000 catties to the district, and the remaining 13,000 catties were wasted. The branch secretary and grain committee member of Quyangqiao Village privately sold 500 catties of public grain black beans and bought a cow. This March, Dong'anfeng Village levied more than 2,000 catties of public grain. The village head, branch secretary, and director of the farmers' association delayed sending it to the district. As a result, on the evening of May 1st, 1,600 catties were stolen.\n\nThe above materials from Lingshou were discovered by the special commissioner's grain inspection team. There are still many problems with the county's grain depot. While inspecting and dealing with the problems, it has now recovered more than 19,500 catties of wheat borrowed, more than 1,640 catties of cotton, and more than 1,000 catties of millet; 292 catties of wheat due to improper scaling; 1,084 catties of wheat and 340 catties of millet sold privately, totaling 280,000 yuan; and 750 catties of stolen grain and 1,900 catties of millet embezzled.\n\nThe Zhengding materials were discovered through the county's own inspection. There are also many problems in various villages. The leadership is determined to rectify the situation. In other counties, except for Fuping, which is relatively good, there are many problems such as embezzlement, waste, theft, private borrowing, spoilage, and consumption. According to preliminary statistics from eight counties, the losses of millet, wheat, and cotton total 332,919 catties, straw 476,903 catties, and firewood 147,182 catties. Based on these materials, a strict review and criticism was carried out at the meeting. It was unanimously believed that the root cause of this serious loss was the serious bureaucratic style of the leadership, with more arrangements and less inspection, work not being thorough, cadres being irresponsible, and embezzlers and illegal elements not being dealt with in a timely manner. The meeting finally decided that it is necessary to conduct in-depth inspections, truly \"go to,\" \"see,\" and \"do,\" oppose superficiality, cultivate a responsible and not wasteful atmosphere of every catty of public grain and grass, earnestly implement the system, and fight against those who violate the system. County leaders should personally take action to thoroughly clean up village depots and resolve legacy issues. Prepare warehouses, organize warehouses, and equip cadres to accept the upcoming autumn levy tasks.\n\n(Xin Weizhou)\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 北岳四专检查粮库　发现严重贪污浪费\n辛维舟\n1948-09-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　北岳四专检查粮库\n  　发现严重贪污浪费\n    （编者按：以上情况是严重的官僚主义所造成；现在领导上检查了官僚主义，规定了以后方针与办法，这是很好的。但对过去问题只抽象提出一句“解决遗留问题”是不够的，应该具体讨论各种办法，认真彻底的解决，否则仍难肃清。）\n    【北岳讯】四专署为了贯彻区党委财委会“关于彻底清查粮库加强粮食管理”指示的精神，本月上旬召开各县粮库主任会议，发现粮秣工作中有严重的混乱现象。灵寿南纪城分库干部李老木、村长李书珍、优恤委员尚老辉三人私借小麦一二八○斤，玉米一二一斤，开店赚钱，李老木又借给其弟小麦八二○斤。从此粮门大开，不论干部群众遇到红白喜事、过节过庙、吃穿开店、买牲口、养病人均可借公粮，共计三十多户，借小麦一二五三四斤，花料一六四七斤，小米六二九斤。北纪城贫农团主任、农会主任、村长、支书等在今春政府征款时，见到米款悬殊擅自征成粮食，粜粮交款，共征小米八四一七斤，豆子四千五百三十七斤，总卖价三、二九四、三六○元，交区二、○五四、四一八元，净得利一、二三九、九四一元。除现存洋一四一、○○○元，又交区二五六、三○○元，及修置水车用洋五三九、六○○元外，其余三○三、○一一元都乱化浪费了。孟家托村贫农团新农会两个负责干部私卖公粮一、○六○斤，又勾结其他村干共十四人，合卖公粮米一、九九五斤，合洋三十余万元，共同分赃。村长孟吉祥偷米一四○斤，又私卖米四○○斤，赚洋八万元。村长村副新农会主任财政委员用公粮作买卖，赚洋七十余万元。白马岗村去冬征款，政府定价每斤米一百四十元，村里按二百元征收，最后长米一、○一八斤，未退还群众，用五六七斤顶了旧公粮，三三六斤做了教育米，下余的全被干部浪费了。岗北村贫农团去年年节，提出过年吃豆腐，借出公粮二千斤。正定东塌子口村贫民团乱借公款七十万元，村公所动用公粮一千斤，办合作社动用公粮一千多斤，公款十多万元（区委批准的）。在征收当中，本村征了公粮五五、○○○斤，只交区四二、○○○斤，其余一三、○○○斤随便浪费了。曲阳桥村支书粮秣委员私卖公粮黑豆五百斤，合买牛一头。东安丰村今年三月征公粮二千余斤，村长支书农会主任拖延不让送区，结果五月一日晚上，被盗去一千六百斤。\n    以上材料，灵寿的问题是专署粮食检查组检查出来的。该县粮库问题尚多，在一面检查一面处理当中，现已收回外借小麦一九、五○○余斤，花料一、六四○余斤，小米一、○○○余斤；折秤不当小麦二九二斤；私卖小麦一、○八四斤，小米三四○斤，二八万元；贪污偷盗谷子七五○斤，小米一、九○○斤。\n    正定材料是该县自行检查出来的，各村问题亦不少。领导上已决心大力整顿。其余各县，除阜平较好外，贪污浪费、偷盗、私借、腐烂消耗等问题均很多。据八县初步统计损失小米、小麦、花料共三三二、九一九斤，谷草四七六、九○三斤，木柴一四七、一八二斤。根据这些材料，会上进行了严格的检讨批判，一致认为遭此严重损失的根源，是领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，布置多，检查少，工作不深入，干部不负责，对贪污浪费不法分子不及时处理所致。会议最后决定：必须深入检查，切实“走到”，“看到”，“办到”，反对走马观花，养成积极负责，不浪费一斤公粮公草的风气，切实执行制度，与破坏制度者作斗争。各县领导应亲自下手，彻底清理村库，解决遗留问题。准备库房、整理库房，配备干部，以接受将要到来的秋征任务。　　\n　　　　　　　　　　（辛维舟）"

The bandit chieftain Yan Xishan, besieged in the isolated city of Taiyuan, has once again extended his begging hand to his imperial masters as his doomsday approaches. According to United Press International dispatches from Washington on the 10th and Nanjing on the 11th: \"A recently released message stated: Yan requested a loan of five to ten million US dollars from the Export-Import Bank to strengthen Shanxi as a fortress against the Communists.\" In addition, Yan Xishan has also requested the Economic Cooperation Administration of the United States to \"allocate some US aid funds.\" However, to Yan's dismay, his American masters showed a cold attitude towards his request. \"A senior official of the Export-Import Bank declared: He knew nothing about the matter of the representative of Shanxi Provincial Chairman Yan Xishan requesting a loan.\" (United Press International) A spokesman for the US Economic Cooperation Administration said even more bluntly: \"Some members of the Stillman Technical Group may have seen some of the factories listed by Yan during a hasty trip to Taiyuan, but other than that, the Shanxi plan has not received much attention.\" This shows that the American masters are not willing to waste US dollars on the lackey Yan Xishan, who is on the verge of dying. Chiang Kai-shek's Nanjing government, which felt extremely jealous of the direct collusion between the American masters and Yan Xishan, even instructed its embassy in the United States to undermine Yan, and publicly adopted an \"accusatory\" attitude towards Yan's request for a US loan.

    "content": "Achievements and Problems in the Cadre Study in Taihang Over the Past Two Months\n　　The cadre study in Taihang started on July 10th and has lasted for nearly two months. Below is the general situation of these two months:\n　　Achievements in Learning\n　　1. Learning has been absorbed: Comrades who previously lacked confidence, interest, had complaints, or had problems in learning have undergone significant changes after their personal issues were appropriately resolved during the study, and their learning attitudes have been corrected. Some cadres from the First Prefectural Committee said, \"This is the first time since joining the revolution that I have really absorbed the learning.\" They also said, \"I am finally feeling interested, and listening to a lecture once is better than reading it myself ten times.\" A cadre from Changzhi said, \"In the past, I felt that my brain was not sufficient, but in reality, I was afraid of using my brain; saying that my memory was not strong was actually because I was not concentrating; I was constantly daydreaming. Saying I had no time was actually because I lacked determination. Without studying, work is equivalent to doing it blindly. Only now do I realize the disadvantage of not studying.\"\n　　2. Preliminary examination and reflection were conducted by the organs and individuals: After studying the document \"Lenin on How Soviet Staff Should Work,\" the District Party Committee and Military Region Political Department deeply felt that in the past, their work lacked planning, system, unclear division of responsibilities, poor research on issues, failure to understand the situation below, delay and carelessness, and failure to provide specific guidance to the lower levels in a timely manner. There was only deployment of work without inspection. There was a lack of serious and responsible spirit towards the people's cause, and a lack of long-term construction perspective in every matter (even small issues).\n　　In terms of personal reflection, there are generally the following kinds of thoughts: (1) After the reorganization, there was fear of making mistakes, and they dared not work boldly, thinking that it was better to do less than to do more, and whoever was active would be unlucky. Some comrades secretly made plans for themselves: to protect themselves wisely, seek no merit but avoid fault, and do whatever they were asked to do, but ignore everything else. Some comrades, when working at the lower levels, insisted on having the tasks assigned by the leaders in written form, fearing that if something went wrong in the future, no one would be responsible. (2) They also showed enthusiasm in their work, but did not like to study, did not want to use their brains, did whatever came their way, and grabbed at whatever they thought of, making a mess, but not getting anywhere. They thought that the instructions and policies from above were always the same old thing, and put them aside after looking at them. Studying or not studying could not solve the difficulties of \"counting ballots,\" \"buying vegetables,\" \"calculating accounts,\" and \"cutting stencils.\" They were sweating profusely when busy, and sleeping soundly when idle. (3) They were not at ease or responsible in their work, shied away from trouble, and made excuses; their hearts were not in the office, and they thought only about personal matters all day long, unable to accomplish anything even sitting at their desks for half a day.\n　　3. The enthusiasm of cadres has been enhanced through examination and reflection, and the work of the organs has been initially transformed: After the examination, the District Party Committee and the Political Department stipulated some new systems and improvement methods in order to correct the problems, and most of them have been implemented consistently. The Audit Section of the Fourth Prefectural Committee Secretariat took the initiative to convene a meeting of the secretaries of the county committees to understand and study the living and production conditions of the organs in each county. The Finance and Grain Section of the Fourth Special Commissioner's Office used to take three days to produce a monthly report, but now it only takes half a day. The accountants used to calculate the abacus seven or eight times without being sure, but now they only need to do it three times. The transportation personnel of the District Party Committee organs used to take at least fifteen days to go to the Fourth Military Sub-district, but now it only takes ten days for a round trip. It has also been shortened by two days to go to the Second Military Sub-district.\n　　Continued Efforts Are Needed\n　　The achievements mentioned above only indicate that the transformation has just begun, because in fact, the phenomenon of lack of organization, discipline, delay, and carelessness still exists universally in the entire area, and continued efforts are needed to overcome it. In the scope of propaganda work alone, many inappropriate events have already occurred: For example, the Sixth Branch of the Jinnan Bank published a newspaper without the approval of the Prefectural Committee, and published a founding speech in the name of an individual. The Huixian United Office printed and distributed a summary of the propaganda of the production movement with errors in its content without the examination of the Prefectural Committee. Qi County casually published a \"Special Issue on Captives,\" which completely misunderstood our Party's lenient policy and fully reflected the right-leaning sentiment of the county's leadership in winning over and disintegrating the enemy's puppet troops. Although these facts have been criticized and corrected by the District Party Committee and the Prefectural Committee, it can be seen that truly learning the documents and transforming work is still an arduous process of effort.\n　　How is the Learning Being Led?\n　　(1) Strengthening ideological leadership in learning, stipulating clear objectives and requirements for each document in advance, conducting necessary lectures and answering questions, making discussion summaries, promptly exchanging learning experiences, and consciously and plannedly praising, rewarding, and criticizing - this is what \"leaders taking responsibility and personally doing it\" means.\n　　(2) In terms of reading methods, the document is first read collectively once, then read section by section to clarify the general meaning of the words and phrases. Then, discussions are conducted in connection with personal familiar matters. After the discussion, they return to understanding the spirit and essence of the document, and then enter a more systematic examination and reflection, and finally rise to the principles to conduct a comprehensive study. Whoever has the deepest understanding of a certain point during the discussion will be the main speaker. For comrades with self-study conditions, self-study is the main focus, in order to cultivate their ability and habit of thinking independently.\n　　(3) The Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee and the local committees have seriously conducted multiple inspections, and have begun to overcome the problem of \"everything is fine once the task is assigned.\" Two direct-affiliated organ learning review meetings have been held before and after, and the reports from various places have been answered promptly by means of convenience letters. The propaganda departments of the local committees have also held more than two inspection meetings, almost every time presided over by the local committee or the head of the propaganda department.\n　　(4) Starting in August, the learning situation, experience, problems, as well as personal learning experiences and typical reflections from various places have been published in the Taihang Xinhua Daily one after another, to strengthen the learning guidance to the entire area through the Party newspaper. This work is not yet systematic and regularized enough, and the newspaper has not yet truly played its role in guiding and promoting learning.\n　　Problems in Learning\n　　In the beginning, some units only emphasized organizational guarantees and neglected ideological leadership, mechanically implementing the two-hour collective learning system. The higher authorities neither raised questions nor solved problems, resulting in opposition between the lower authorities and the branches, and everyone's learning enthusiasm was not high, such as the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth Military Sub-district and the Military Committee of the Fifth Military Sub-district. Some units made egalitarian mistakes in leadership, without considering the degree, differentiating the situation, or combining the cadres' business requirements, and uniformly distributed the four major documents, making it difficult for some cadres to digest and not enthusiastic. In some places, the leaders did not clearly stipulate the purpose and requirements of the documents in advance, so everyone argued and reflected for a long time, but in the end, they did not grasp the essence of the documents and took detours. In some units, many things were reflected, and a pile of materials was gathered, but the leaders did not analyze and criticize them, and did not summarize them in time, which greatly affected the effectiveness.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 太行两月来干部学习的成绩与问题\n\n1948-09-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　太行两月来干部学习的成绩与问题\n    太行干部学习，从七月十日开始，将近两月，下面是这两个月来的一般情况：\n  　学习有成绩\n    一、学进去了：过去在学习上没信心、没兴趣、有牢骚、有问题的同志，经过在学习中个人问题的适当解决，端正了学习态度，有了很大转变。一地委一些干部说：“参加革命以来，第一次学习进去了。”又说：“这才感到兴趣、听讲一遍，比自己读十遍都强。”长治一个干部说：“过去我觉得脑筋不够用，实际上是怕用脑子；说自己记忆力不强，实际上是思想不集中；成天胡思乱想。说没时间，实际上是没决心。不学习，工作就等于瞎干，这才知道吃了不学习的亏。”\n    二、机关和个人进行了初步检查反省：区党委和军区政治部，在学习“列宁论苏维埃机关人员应如何工作”文件后，深感过去在工作中无计划、无制度，分工职责不明，研究问题差，不了解下情，拖延草率，不能及时给下面以具体指导。工作有布置没有检查。在每一件事情上（那怕是细小问题）缺乏严肃的、对人民事业负责的精神，缺乏长期建设观点。\n    个人反省方面，一般有这样几种思想：（一）整编以后怕犯错误，工作不敢大胆干，认为多一事不如少一事，谁积极谁倒霉。有的同志暗中给自己订出计划：明哲保身，但求无过，叫我干啥就干啥，其他一概不管。还有的同志在下边做工作，领导上布置任务时，非写成成文不可，怕将来出岔子没人负责。（二）工作也表现积极，就是不爱学习，不想多用脑子，来了啥干啥，想起啥干啥，乱抓一阵，但忙不出个头绪来。对上级指示、政策认为总是那一套，看看便放到一边。学习不学习解决不了“点票子”，“买菜”，“算帐打算盘”，“刻蜡板”的困难。忙时满头大汗，闲时睡大觉。（三）工作不安心不负责、嫌麻烦，遇事推脱；身在机关心在外，一天想着的只是个人问题，坐在办公桌子旁半天也干不出一点事来。\n    三、经过检讨反省提高了干部积极性，初步改造了机关工作：区党委和政治部经检查后，为了纠正毛病，规定了一些新制度和改进办法，大部已坚持实行了。四地委秘书处审计科主动召集各县委秘书开会，了解和研究各县机关生活和生产情况。四专署财粮科以前三天造一个月报表，现在只用半天，会计打算盘七八遍还不能保险，现在三遍就行了。区党委机关交通人员以前去四分区至少要十五天，现在只用十天即可往还，去二分区也缩短了两天。\n  　还须继续努力\n    有了上面提出的成绩，只说明转变才开始，因为事实上无组织、无纪律、拖延、草率现象在全区仍普遍的存在，仍须继续努力克服。仅就宣传工作范围来说，目前即已发生许多不应有的事件：如冀南银行六分行，不经地委批准就出版报纸，并以个人名义发表创刊词。辉县联合办公室不经地委审查就印发了一个内容有着错误的生产运动宣传要点。淇县随便出了一期“俘虏特刊”，完全误解我党的宽大政策，充分反映了该县领导上在争取瓦解敌伪军方面的右倾情绪，这些事实，虽都经区党委和地委批评纠正了。可以看到，真正学好文件改造工作，还是一个艰苦努力过程。\n  　学习是怎样领导的\n    （一）加强学习中的思想领导，对每个文件事先规定明确的目的和要求，进行必要的讲授和解答疑问，做讨论总结，即时交流学习经验，有意识有计划的表扬、奖励和批评，这才是“首长负责亲自动手”。\n    （二）在阅读方法上，先集体把文件读一遍，然后逐段读，弄清辞句大意。再联系个人的熟知事情进行讨论，讨论后返回来领会文件的精神与实质，而后进入较系统的检查反省，最后提高到原则上来做全盘研究。讨论中谁对某一点体会最深刻谁即做主要发言人。对于有自修条件的同志以自学为主，以培养他们独自思考问题的能力和习惯。\n    （三）区党委和各地委宣传部，认真进行了多次的检查，开始克服那种“任务布置下去就万事大吉”的毛病。前后开过两次直属机关学习检讨会，对各地报告及时的用便信方式答复。各地委宣传部也都开过两次以上的检查会议，差不多每次都由地委或地委宣传部长亲自主持。\n    （四）从八月份开始，陆续把各地学习情况、经验、问题以及个人学习心得、典型反省等在太行新华日报发表，通过党报加强对全区学习指导，这个工作还不够系统化、经常化，还没使报纸真正发挥它指导和推动学习的作用。\n  　学习中的毛病\n    开始有些单位只强调组织保证，忽视了思想领导，机械的执行两小时集体学习制，上边既不提出问题，也不解决问题，结果形成下边和支部闹对立，大家学习情绪不高。如四分区公安局，五分区武委会。有些单位在领导上犯了平均主义，不按程度，不分情况，不结合干部的业务要求，千篇一律把四大文件布置下去，有些干部啃不动，劲头不大。有的地方领导上对文件目的和要求事先没明确规定，以致大家争论半天，反省半天，结果没掌握文件精神实质，走了弯路。还有的单位反省出许多东西，拢一堆材料，领导上未加分析批判，未及时讨论总结，影响收效很大。"

Local management committees will also be established in various regions. The committee has already collected hundreds of precious items in Binbei, Bohai, Jiaodong, Weifang and other places, including oracle bones from the Yin Ruins, bronzes, tripods, pots, mirrors, and pottery from the Zhou, Qin, Han, and Wei dynasties, as well as porcelain, ancient jade, ancient coins from various dynasties, famous paintings and calligraphy from the Ming and Qing dynasties, rare books from the Song and Yuan dynasties, ancient rubbings from stone inscriptions, and calligraphy, and more than two thousand books. Many of these items were voluntarily donated by local people after understanding the democratic government's policy of protecting ancient cultural relics. The committee is currently sorting and properly preserving them.\n\nIn other news: When our army liberated Yanzhou, it seized fifty boxes of ancient artifacts from the Confucius Temple in Qufu. These artifacts were secretly transported to Yanzhou by Kong Lingshu, a degenerate descendant of Confucius, in collusion with Kuomintang bandit troops before the liberation of Qufu, with the intention of transporting them abroad. After identification by the Shandong Ancient Cultural Relics Management Committee, to which our receiving agency handed them over, it was determined that ten Zhou dynasty bronzes were ancient treasures, which were first given to the Confucius Temple during the Qianlong period of the Qing dynasty to be displayed during the spring and autumn ceremonies and usually stored in the inner treasury. It was truly inappropriate to transport them abroad, and they have been taken into custody by the committee. The remaining items, such as the Han offering vessels, golden bells, and jade chimes inscribed with the words \"Confucius Temple,\" were returned to the Confucius Temple for use. A portion of the items that belonged to the personal belongings of the Kong family were all returned to their original owners.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 山东　征集保存古代文物\n\n1948-09-29\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　山东\n  　征集保存古代文物\n    【新华社华东二十五日电】山东省政府顷发出保护古代文物通令，并成立山东古代文物管理委员会，各地亦将建立地方管理委员会。现该会已在滨北、渤海、胶东、维坊市等地搜集到殷墟甲骨，周、秦、汉、魏之钟、鼎、壶、镜、陶器，历代瓷器、古玉、古钱，明、清名人书画，宋、元善本书、古拓碑帖、字画等珍品数百件，藏书二千余册。其中不少是地方人士在了解民主政府保护古代文物之政策后，先后自动捐献者。现该会正整理并妥为保存中。\n    又讯：我军解放兖州时，曾查获曲阜孔庙古物五十箱，系孔子不肖子孙孔令淑于曲阜解放前，勾结国民党匪军私运抵兖，准备外运者。经我接收机关移交山东古代文物管理委员会鉴别结果，其中周代铜器十件，为古代珍物，清乾隆年间始给孔庙于春秋两祭时陈列，平时收藏内库，此次竟被外运，实属不合，已由该会保管；其余如汉供五器、金钟、玉罄等铸有孔庙字样者，仍发回孔庙应用；其中一部分属于孔氏私人之用品，全部发回原主。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 28th: Our frontline correspondent reports: The Kuomintang army's outer defense system around Jinan, extending over a hundred miles north-south and east-west, was completely shattered after three days and four nights of fierce attacks by the powerful People's Liberation Army. The PLA's offensive spearheads quickly reached the city walls and commercial district of Jinan. Jinan's defensive fortifications, built over many years by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang army, and further reinforced by the enemy chieftain Wang Yaowu in recent months, formed a modern, semi-permanent defense system. A deep and tight four-layered defensive system, consisting of outer positions, forward positions, main positions, and core positions, was constructed in the vast area north from Queshan Mountain on the northern bank of the Yellow River, south to Wandekezhan Station on the Jinpu Railway, east to Guodian Station on the Jiaoji Railway, and west to the counties of Changqing and Qihe, protecting the urban area of Jinan. The outer positions were made up of towns and strongholds such as Changqing, Qihe, Gushan, and Zhonggong, located twenty to sixty *li* from Jinan, dotted with pillboxes and crisscrossed by trenches. The enemy intended to use these to prevent the PLA's advance and deplete its combat power. However, on the first night of the PLA's offensive (the night of the 16th), these towns and strongholds suffered devastating blows and collapsed across the board. The defending enemy was either annihilated (as in Changqing) or scattered (as in Gushan and Zhonggong). The PLA advanced rapidly, like a hot knife through butter, directly attacking the forward and main positions. The forward positions, fifteen to twenty *li* from the city, consisted of more than sixty small strongholds; the main positions, within fifteen *li* of the city, consisted of over a hundred strong and fortified strongholds, including the Yellow River Railway Bridge, the airfield under Thousand Buddha Mountain, and the army barracks. Strongholds such as Lashan, Jingjiagou, Maolingshan, and Pingdingshan all had numerous mother-and-son pillboxes and cavity-style fortifications, constructed of reinforced concrete or thick earth and stone, with depth and focus, and a tight interlocking fire network. The defending enemy had fantasized about stubbornly resisting here. However, under the powerful artillery fire and the astonishing bravery of the PLA, the enemy's three lines of defense were shattered in just three days and four nights from the 17th to the 19th. Most of the strongholds and defending enemy were captured and annihilated, leaving only a few isolated remnants and strongholds that had been cut off. On the night of the 19th, the PLA attacked the core positions consisting of Jinan's outer moat and the commercial district. At this point, the first stage of the Battle of Jinan had achieved a decisive victory. The rapid progress of the offensive reflected the unprecedented strength of the PLA and the vigorous fighting spirit of the commanders and soldiers, demonstrating that no solid fortifications could stop the PLA's advance. A saying was widely spread among the frontline soldiers and participating laborers: \"Too fast! Too fast!\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 强大炮火无坚不摧　粉碎济南敌外围防御经过\n\n1948-09-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　强大炮火无坚不摧\n  　粉碎济南敌外围防御经过\n    【新华社济南前线二十八日电】前线记者报道：国民党军在济南周围南北、东西各百余里的外围防御体系，经强大的解放军三昼四夜的勇猛攻击即被彻底粉碎。各路解放军的攻势矛头迅即抵达济市城垣与商埠区。济南的防御工事经过日寇与国民党军多年的构筑，又加上敌酋王耀武最近数月日夜增修，形成现代化半永久性的防御体系。北起黄河北岸的鹊山、南抵津浦路万德车站、东至胶济路郭店车站、西达长清、齐河县城的广阔地带内，编成了外围阵地、警戒阵地、主阵地与核心阵地四层纵深严密的防御工事，围护济南市区。外围阵地是由距济南二十至六十华里的长清、齐河、崮山、中宫等城镇据点所构成，点碉林立，沟壕纵横。敌人准备据此以阻止解放军的前进与消耗解放军的战力。但在解放军发起攻势的第一夜（即十六日夜），这些城镇据点就受到了毁灭性的打击，全线崩溃。守敌或被歼（如长清）或溃散（如崮山、中宫）。解放军长驱直入，势如破竹，直捣警戒阵地与主阵地。警戒阵地距城十五至二十里，为六十余小据点所构成；主阵地为距城十五里以内地带，黄河大铁桥、千佛山下飞机场与陆军营房等百余强固据点所构成。其中腊山、井家沟、茂岭山、平顶山等据点均拥有大量的子母堡群与夹壁式工事，为钢骨水泥或高厚的土石筑成，有纵深、有重点，并有严密的交叉火力网，守敌曾幻想凭此顽抗。但在解放军的强大炮火与惊人的勇猛的巨大威力下，仅十七日至十九日短促的三昼四夜内敌三道阵地即告粉碎，大部据点与守敌被攻克、歼灭，只剩少数被分割的孤立的残敌与据点。十九日夜各路解放军即攻至济城外壕与商埠所构成的核心阵地。至此，解放济南之战第一阶段即取得决定的胜利。攻势进展的神速，反映了解放军空前强大与指战员旺盛斗志；说明任何坚固工事也无法阻止解放军前进。前线战士和参战民工普遍流传着一句话：“太快了！太快了！”"

    "content": "Jincheng Grasps Autumn Harvest and Planting Leadership Tightly\n  　Taiyue Fourth Administrative Office Issues Circular Commending\n    [Taiyue Electric Dispatch] The Fourth Administrative Office of Taiyue issued a circular commending Jincheng for its rapid progress in promoting the autumn harvest campaign. Since September 3rd, when all districts simultaneously convened village cadre meetings to call for strengthening leadership in production, the masses in all villages have been organized to harvest autumn crops and plant wheat. In just ten days, two-thirds of the county's more than 250,000 mu of millet have been harvested. In nine villages including Houjiang and Weijiang in the Fifth District, more than 2,400 mu of millet were completely harvested by September 8th. To prevent spoilage from rain, the masses in the mountainous areas implemented the practice of cutting, carrying, and threshing simultaneously, and harvested all the millet in the fields within five days. In the Liuquan Administrative Village, 76 percent of the labor force has been organized, with 280 women participating as full laborers, one-third more than the number of male full laborers. All the millet in the village has been harvested, and two-thirds has been threshed, with 1,496 shi having been brought home. Wheat fields throughout the county have generally been plowed once, and most have been plowed twice. According to statistics from 13 villages in the Fourth District, 1,708 mu of the 5,778 mu of dry land wheat fields have been plowed three times. According to statistics from nine villages, 3,750 mu of dry land wheat have already been sown. The reason why Jincheng has been able to do so quickly this year is mainly because the county and district leadership have grasped the work tightly. Before the instructions of the local Party committee and the administrative office on fully mobilizing the autumn harvest campaign were even printed, the Jincheng County Party Committee and the county government had already arranged the work based on the revised draft and issued supplementary instructions, stating that the wheat was planted late last year, resulting in losses, and this year it must be planted early and well, calling on cadres to take the lead and overcome the spontaneous tendency of not paying attention to leading production. At that time, most of the county and district cadres had gone to participate in the district Party committee and local Party committee meetings, and there were very few cadres left in the county. However, in order to strengthen leadership, the county government and the county Party committee organs squeezed out eight cadres to guide the work in various districts.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 晋城收种领导抓的紧　太岳四专署通令表扬\n\n1948-09-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　晋城收种领导抓的紧\n  　太岳四专署通令表扬\n    【太岳电】太岳第四专署通报表扬晋城三秋运动推动的快。自九月三日各区同时召开村干部大会，号召加强领导生产后，各村群众都组织起来收秋种麦。仅十天工夫，全县二十五万多亩谷已割了三分之二。五区候匠、苇匠等九个村二千四百多亩谷，至九月八日已全部割完。山头群众为防止雨沤，实行随割、随担、随打，五天就把全部谷子收到场里。柳泉行政村百分之七十六的劳力已组织起来，光妇女全劳力就参加了二百八十个，比男全劳力还多三分之一。该村谷子已全割完，并打了三分之二，收回家的有一千四百九十六石。全县麦地普遍犁过头遍，大部犁过二遍。据四区十三个村统计：五千七百七十八亩旱麦地，有一千七百零八亩犁过三遍。又据九个村统计：已有三千七百五十亩旱麦地下种。今年晋城所以能做得这样快，主要是县、区领导抓的较紧。当地委、专署全力动员开展三秋运动指示还未印出，晋城县委和县政府即根据修正好的草稿布置了工作，还发出补充指示，说去年麦子种的晚，受了损失，今年要种的早，种的好，号召干部带头，克服不重视领导生产的自流现象。当时全县县、区干部大部参加区党委、地委会议去了，县里留的干部很少，但他们为加强领导，在县府与县委机关挤抽出八个干部到各区指导工作。"

Because its impact is so significant, the Kuomintang government and the newspapers in Nanjing controlled by the Kuomintang have suppressed the news of the loss of Jinan.\" The Kuomintang government, as late as the 25th, \"was unwilling to officially admit its complete fall, attempting to mitigate its fatal blow to the political, military, and economic structure of China (Kuomintang-controlled areas).\" The foolish Kuomintang rumor company, the Central News Agency, even on the day after Jinan was completely liberated, vigorously promoted its imaginary Wang Yaowu's troops in Jinan \"fighting for every house\" with the People's Liberation Army, \"engaging in desperate hand-to-hand combat,\" and \"repeatedly launching counter-attacks outward from the inner city.\" Even on the 26th, it was still promoting the so-called defending troops inside the city \"echoing\" the fighting outside the city. People here say: The panicked bandits have become so weak that they can only rely on daily lies to maintain their crumbling rule. Even if these lies only last for a day, they are necessary for them, because after people know the truth, the most dangerous impact will be relatively缓和, and they will feel like they can still survive. In the Kaifeng campaign in June, the defending enemy was completely annihilated, but the Central News Agency spread rumors that they \"withdrew to the suburbs to continue to strike the stubborn bandits.\" In the Henan-East Campaign, the Kuomintang lost 50,000 troops, and Qu Shounian and Shen Chengnian were captured, but in the Central News Agency's words, it became an \"unprecedented great victory.\" The loss of Yanzhou was a \"planned retreat\"; Kang Ze's capture was also publicized as \"heroic martyrdom.\" The Central News Agency will never admit the complete annihilation of Jinan's entire army, and the Jinan defending enemy, with no way to go to heaven and no way to go to earth, cannot \"transfer to a favorable position under orders because the strategic mission has been achieved\"; then, let's see how the Central News Agency will report on this unprecedented victory of the People's Liberation Army in Jinan.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 济南解放震动南京　蒋匪政权根基益形动摇　匪最高统帅部目瞪口呆\n\n1948-09-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　济南解放震动南京\n  　蒋匪政权根基益形动摇\n  　匪最高统帅部目瞪口呆\n    【新华社济南二十七日电】人民解放军二十四日解放济南全歼守敌的伟大胜利，已使国民党最高统帅部惊惶得目瞪口呆。这是二十五日南京美联社电讯的描写。该讯说，这是一个“动摇蒋介石政权根基的军事胜利。因为它的影响是如此重大，所以国民党政府与国民党控制下的南京各家报纸，都压下了济南丧失的消息”。国民党政府迟至二十五日，“还不愿正式承认其完全失陷，企图缓和其对中国（国民党统治区）政治、军事与经济结构的致命打击”。愚蠢的国民党造谣公司中央社在济南已被完全解放之次日，还大肆宣传其幻想中的王耀武部队在济南与解放军“逐屋争夺”，“拚死肉搏”，“自内城迭次向外反复突击”。甚至廿六日还在宣传所谓城内守军与城外“互相呼应”作战。此间人士称：惊慌失措的匪帮已经虚弱到如此程度，只能依赖每天的谎言来维持其摇摇欲坠的统治，这种谎言纵然只能维持一天的时效，对于他们也是必要的，因为等到人们都知道事实的真相以后，它的最危险的冲击力量就会比较和缓一点，他们就觉得似乎还可以活命了。在六月开封之役，守敌全歼，中央社却造谣说是“撤至郊外，续予顽匪以打击”。豫东之役，国民党丧师五万，区寿年、沈澄年被俘，在中央社口中却变成“空前大捷”。兖州的失守，则是“有计划之转进”；康泽的被俘，又宣传“壮烈殉职”。中央社是决不会承认济南的全军覆灭的，而上天无路，入地无门的济南守敌又无法“因战略任务已达，奉命转移有利阵地”；那么，我们且看中央社将如何来报导解放军这一次济南的空前大捷吧。"

Xie Xichang, former Deputy Brigade Commander of the 30th Division, 30th Brigade, who was captured in the Linfen Campaign, said, \"This is to be a funeral offering for Yan Xishan!\" He said, \"Hu Zongnan knew very well that Taiyuan was completely isolated and on the verge of collapse, and that reinforcements would never return. Of course, he would send in the miscellaneous troops. This way, he could respond to Yan Xishan without losing his own assets.\" He said, \"The Northwest Army is either assimilated by Chiang and Hu, or sent to their deaths to be destroyed. In 1929, the original Northwest Army still had 34 regiments, not including the directly subordinate brigades of various armies and divisions. Now, only a few remnants remain, such as Liu Ruming, Cao Fulin, and Feng Zhian. The 30th Division now has only three regiments left. The reason why Chiang Kai-shek has not immediately swallowed up these troops is simply to use them to fight to the death against the Communists for him.\" He was extremely concerned about his many old friends in the 27th Brigade.

    "content": "[Jizhong Electric] The Raoyang County government, in order to strengthen village financial management, reduce the people's burden, and strive for a balanced and reasonable burden between villages, began to implement county-level unified management of village finances and grain in August. Before the land reform last year, a district-level unified management pilot program was conducted in the First District. The financial and grain resources for half a year were used for three seasons, and it did not become chaotic even until the land reform. In villages without district-level unified management, waste was very serious. Actual expenditures exceeded the required expenditures by one to two times. In Daqianmin Village with 290 households, the regular expenditure from January to July was 1,002 jin of millet, and the extra expenditure was 2,400 jin of millet. Yao Village, with a total of 268 households, spent 346 jin of rice in April alone for regular expenses, and 945 jin for wasteful expenses. Villages that implemented unified management saved much more. For example, in the Northeast Street of the city with 221 households, the total expenditure in March was 181 jin of rice. In Nanguan with 243 households, the expenditure for three months was 450 jin of rice. In July, the Raoyang County government convened a joint meeting of district heads and a financial meeting to discuss the unified management and expenditure issues, and stipulated the future management methods and various systems: (1) Method and Quantity of Unified Management: According to the severity of the disaster before autumn this year, villages were divided into several grades, with appropriate reductions and exemptions. Villages not affected by floods were allocated according to their taxpaying capacity, with a total of three months of unified management. An average taxpaying unit would bear 14.5 liang of millet. Semi-disaster villages would have a 15% reduction. Severely affected villages without wheat harvest and also affected by floods (unable to plant wheat this year) would receive a 50% reduction, with a taxpaying unit contributing 6 liang of millet. (2) Expenditure Items and Expenditure Standards: Four major items were determined: village office expenses, education expenses, Armed Forces Committee office expenses, and miscellaneous expenses. The expenditure standards and quantities should be determined according to the number of households in each village: 250 jin per month for villages with 400 to 500 households, 200 jin per month for villages with 250 to 400 households, 150 jin per month for villages with 150 to 250 households, and 100 jin per month for villages with less than 150 households (80 jin for villages with less than 100 households without teachers). The above expenditure amounts do not include teachers' salaries. (3) To reward savings in expenditure, public and miscellaneous expenses are implemented on a contract basis, and surpluses belong to the village. Each month, a budget is prepared according to the expenditure standards, and villages with surpluses can pay less when submitting unified management grain next time. (4) Management Method: Adopt county-level unified management and district-level administration. The county directly allocates to the village, and each district sets up a \"village grain depot\" in the resident village, finding a dedicated person to be responsible for issuing grain with vouchers. The depot is opened once a month, and each district reports accounts and submits forms to the county. Miscellaneous expenses account for 35% of the total monthly expenditure (excluding teacher grain), with 15% issued to the village, and the remaining 20% can only be used with district approval, and can also be adjusted and used by the county and district. When adjusting, major expenditures must be reported to the county for approval.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 饶阳克服浪费减轻民负　实行村财粮县统筹\n\n1948-09-29\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　饶阳克服浪费减轻民负\n  　实行村财粮县统筹\n    【冀中电】饶阳县政府为加强村财政管理，减轻人民负担，争取村和村的负担平衡合理，从八月份开始实行村财粮县统筹。去年土改以前，就在一区试办过区统筹，半年的财粮用了三季，直到土改也没混乱了。没由区统筹的村，浪费现象就很严重。实开支超过应开支的一倍到两倍。大迁民庄二百九十户，一月到七月正项开支一千零二斤小米，额外开支二千四百斤小米。姚庄共二百六十八户，光四月份正项开支三百四十六斤米，浪费开支九百四十五斤。实行了统筹的村就节省多了。如城里东北街二百廿一户，三月共开支了一百八十一斤米。南关二百四十三户，三个月开支四百五十斤米。饶阳县政府，在七月里召开了区长联席会和财政会议，讨论了统筹和开支问题，规定了今后管理办法和各种制度：（一）统筹的办法和数量：按照今年秋前灾情轻重分出几等村，适当减免。没受水灾的村，按纳税富力摊派，共统筹三个月的，一个富力平均负担小米十四两半，半灾村减少百分之十五，没麦收又被水灾的重灾村（今年也种不上麦子的），照顾百分之五十，一个纳税富力统筹六两小米。（二）开支科目和开支标准：确定有村公所办公费、教育费、武委会办公费、临时费四大科目。开支标准和数量，要按各村户数多少确定：四百到五百户的，一个月二百五十斤。二百五十户到四百户的村，一个月二百斤。一百五十户到二百五十户的村，一个月开支一百五十斤。一百五十户以下的村，一个月一百斤（一百户以下没教员的村八十斤）。以上开支数目，不包括教员薪金。（三）为奖励节省开支，公杂费采取包干制，节余归村。每月按开支标准填造预算，下次交统筹粮时，节余村可少交。（四）管理办法：采取县统筹区管理。由县直接分配到村，每区在驻村设一个“村粮库”，找出专人负责，凭支票发粮食。一个月开一回库，各区报帐，造表报县。临时费占每月总开支的百分之三十五（不包括教员粮），把百分之十五发到村，剩下的百分之二十，经区批准才能动用，还可以由县区调剂使用，调剂的时候，大项开支得报县批准。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th\n\n　　Rely on the Masses to Use Their Hands and Brains to Improve Technology:\n    Andong Silk Weaving Factory Increases Production\n    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 25th] In terms of business management, the Andong Silk Weaving Factory has focused on the central links in production and systematically improved working conditions and methods. At the same time, it has mobilized and relied on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. From the factory director to the workers, everyone uses their brains and hands. In the past six months, both output and quality have been greatly improved.\n    Silk weaving's cotton preparation is the first process in the entire production. Whether the cotton is prepared evenly and cleanly directly affects the production of other departments. The factory first studied this central link and replaced all the curved needles used for combing cotton and the distance between the needle rollers, thus ensuring the smooth operation of the next department (spinning department). Similarly, in each department, the central link—the first process—of that department is grasped and studied, and technology is improved with emphasis. As a result of this implementation, the entire production process from silk cotton to fine yarn has consistently maintained the uniformity of silk cotton refining and yarn. This uniformity reduces yarn breakage, reduces reused cotton and waste products, reduces labor, and thus increases production and improves quality. According to the factory's statistics, before April, there was almost one knot per yard of fine yarn, but now there is generally only one knot per 1,150 yards; before April, one person could not watch more than one hundred fine yarn spindles, but now they can watch three hundred. In April, each machine wove 13.8 yards of silk per day, but now it is 21.5 yards.\n    In terms of relying on the masses to use their hands and brains to study and improve technology, the factory, after repeated deliberation and mobilization, launched a wave of joint research on technical improvement and work methods from the factory director to the workers. There are more than 40 kinds of creations and improvements in the whole factory, most of which are the achievements of workers and group leaders. For example, Yan Shujun, the roving group leader in the tussah spinning workshop, started from studying the knots in fine yarn and studied each process forward. She found that roving also had knots, and refining and preparation were also uneven. Finally, she found that it was due to the uneven pressing of silk cotton by the drafting machine. Therefore, she studied how to make the drafting machine press one more time to correct the unevenness.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 依靠群众动手动脑改进技术。　安东丝织厂生产提高\n\n1948-09-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　依靠群众动手动脑改进技术。\n  　安东丝织厂生产提高\n    【新华社东北二十五日电】安东丝织厂在经营管理上，抓住生产中的中心环节与有计划地改进工作条件和工作方法，同时，发动与依靠群众的积极性与创造性，从厂长至工人一齐动脑动手，半年来，已使产量与质量大大提高。\n    丝织厂的制绵是全盘生产的首道过程，绵制的是否均匀清洁直接影响到其他部门的生产。该厂即首先研究了这一中心环节，全部调换了梳绵用的弯针及针滚之间的距离，因而保证了下一部门（纺纱部）顺利工作。同样在每一个部门中也抓住与研究该部门的中心环节——第一道过程；并有重点的改进技术。由于这样实行的结果，使丝绵到细纱的整个生产过程，始终保持了丝绵练筱与纱的均匀；这种均匀就减少了断头，减少了复用绵与废品，减少了人工，也就使生产量增加，质量提高。据该厂统计比较，四月份以前几乎每码细纱有一个疙瘩，现在一般的一千一百五十码才有一个疙瘩；四月份以前一人看不了一百个细纱锭子，现在看三百个。四月份每天每机织绸一三·八码，现在是二一·五码。\n    在依靠群众动手动脑研究改进技术方面，该厂经过反复酝酿和动员，掀起自厂长至工人共同研究技术改进工作方法的热潮。全厂各种创造与改进共有四十多种，其中大部分是工人与小组长的成绩。如柞纺间粗纱组长阎淑君从研究细纱的有疙瘩起，一道道工程的往前研究，发现粗纱也有疙瘩，练筱与制筱也粗细不匀，最后发现是由于延展机压得丝绵不均匀的后果。于是她研究出让延展机多压一遍，纠正不匀的毛病。"

    "content": "Column: Inquiry and Reply\n\n　　Agricultural Tax Should Be Levied Based on Normal Yield\n\nComrades Editors:\n\n　　The spirit conveyed by the district this year is to levy the same amount based on the average yield per mu in homogeneous areas, without increasing the tax for those with higher yields, as an incentive for production. However, in this village where land reform is not thorough, the amount of land is similar, but the quality differs significantly. This reward for production largely benefits landlords and rich peasants who were not thoroughly struggled against.\n\n　　The poor peasant association has raised several points: First, within homogeneous areas, landlords and rich peasants have years of deep plowing and fertilization, while poor peasants and hired laborers lack draught animals and the ability to cultivate intensively. Second, those with oxen can plant early and have higher yields; those without oxen plant late and have lower yields. Third, within homogeneous areas, yields vary from one plot to another. If we proceed according to the original spirit, it will be difficult to convince the poor and hired laborers.\n\n　　Based on the opinions reflected above, and in conjunction with the specific research of village cadres, we have come up with a flexible approach: to divide the average land quality (wheat land) of each household into three different grades (not based on class composition), but in this way, landlords and rich peasants, as well as a few village cadres who have turned over too quickly, are placed in the first grade, middle peasants in the second grade, and poor peasants and below in the third grade. The tax per mu for each grade is allocated according to the total wheat tax task of the village. Apart from this, other principles and methods are carried out according to the district's arrangements.\n\n　　After this preliminary arrangement was reported to the district, the district official in charge believed that the grading was based on class composition. He said this was a violation of principles and ordered immediate correction. He also told us to study the Border Region Government's wheat tax work instructions (People's Daily No. 4). After reading it, I believe that there are differences between the Jinnan and Jizhong areas in terms of land reform work, and in areas where the struggle is not thorough, such wheat taxation may not be reasonable for both the landlord/rich peasant and poor/hired laborer classes. We were told to correct it immediately, and since it was said to be a violation of principles, we had no choice but to correct it. However, the poor and hired laborers have the above opinions, and we have made the above decision. Please provide a solution and instructions!\n\n　　In addition, regarding the party rectification issue: After we arrived in the village, we divided the party member cadres and non-party cadres into two groups and conducted the rectification separately. Later, the district party committee, after research, said that they should be mixed together. Apart from believing that mixed grouping can concentrate the opinions of mass representatives and reduce the number of leading comrades, we do not understand the other spirit. Please also introduce the advantages of mixed grouping in various places to us for reference.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　PingShan Third District Houying Work Group　　Wang Gan\n\n　　Answer: Regarding the burden issue, we have asked the Department of Finance to reply as follows:\n\n　　It is correct to calculate the burden of land based on normal annual yield in order to reward production. One cannot divide classes in rewarding production just because land reform is not thorough. Doing so will cause some people to be passive in production and affect production. The burden should serve the interests of developing production.\n\n　　Regarding the many difficulties of peasants who have turned over in production, we must pay attention to helping solve them in supporting farmers' production. For example, mutual aid and loans should especially take into account the difficulties of newly turned-over peasants. However, one cannot divide grades when calculating the burden. Doing so will not only increase the burden on \"landlords and rich peasants\" who have not been thoroughly struggled against, but also increase the burden on middle peasants. This is still the mistake of a pure poor peasant and hired laborer perspective. One of the five specific policies of uniting with the middle peasants as stipulated by Chairman Mao is that the burden should be fair and reasonable and should not harm the middle peasants. After the poor peasants have turned over, we should pay great attention to helping them solve their difficulties, but we cannot expect them to have the same production base or the same harvest as other middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants all at once. This is impossible. On this point, we should conduct a good explanation and persuasion of the poor and hired laborers.\n\n　　Regarding the issue of party rectification, party rectification is only for party members, so party member cadres and non-party cadres should not be mixed together. In order to make the party rectification open and facilitate the absorption of the opinions of the masses, mass representatives and non-party cadres can be invited to attend branch party rectification meetings. As for criticism of non-party cadres, it should generally be conducted at the village people's representative meeting or village government meeting.\n\n　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Editor\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 农业税应按常年产量征收\n王干\n1948-09-30\n第1版()\n专栏：询问与答复\n\n　　农业税应按常年产量征收编者同志：\n    今年区里布置的精神，在同质地区以每亩平均产量等量征收，而多产者不多收，这是为奖励生产。但在土改不彻底的这个村，土地数量相差不多，而质量则有显著的差别，这样奖励生产大都奖励了斗的不彻底的地富了。\n    贫农团提出了几个意见：一、在同质地区内的土地，地富有多年的深耕、肥大，而贫雇则多年缺乏耕牛，无力精耕细作。二、有牛可以早种，产量多；没牛则晚种产量即少。三、在同质地区范围内，这一块与那一块产量也有不同。若按原精神作下去打不通贫雇阶层的思想。\n    我们根据以上反映的意见，结合村干具体研究出灵活办法是：按每户的平均地质（麦地）划分为三个不同的等级（不是以阶级成份划分），但这样划清，无形中地富及翻身过高的个别村干列为一等，中农列为二等，贫农以下为三等，各级每亩所征数，按全村麦征任务数字，分别分配。除此外其他原则办法等均按区里布置进行。\n    按这样初步布置汇报区后，区负责同志认为划分等级是以阶级成份划分的。说这是违犯原则了，叫立即纠正。并叫我们研究边府麦征工作指示（人民日报第四号），我看了后，认为冀南和冀中等区域在土改工作上是有区别的，而象这斗争不彻底的地区，那样麦征恐对地富及对贫雇两阶级不易合理，而叫立即纠正，并说是违犯原则，我们只有纠正。但贫雇群众有上述意见，我们有过上述决定，请给解答指示！\n    另外关于整党问题：我们到村后是将党员干部与非党干部分编两组，同时分别进行的。后区委研究后，说应混合编组进行。我们除认为混编后，可使群众代表集中意见及减少领导同志外，其他的精神，领会不到。亦请把各地混编的优点介绍给我们作参考。\n    　平山三区后营工作组　王干\n    答：关于负担问题，我们已请财政厅答复如下：\n    为了奖励生产，土地按常年应产量计算负担，这是对的，不能因为土地改革不彻底，而在奖励生产上划分阶级。这样做的结果会造成某些人生产上的消极，而影响生产，负担是应当服从发展生产的利益的。\n    关于翻身农民生产上的许多困难，我们在扶植农民生产上，必须注意帮助解决。如组织互助、贷款都应特别照顾新翻身农民的困难。但不能在计算负担时划分等级，这样做，不仅加重未斗透的“地主富农”的负担，也将加重中农负担。这还是单纯的贫雇观点的毛病。毛主席所规定的团结中农的五项具体政策中，就有一条是负担公平合理，不要伤害中农，在贫苦农民翻身以后，我们应该予以极大注意帮助解决他们的困难，但也不能要求他们一下子通通都与其他中农或富裕中农有一样的生产基础，一样的能收到同等的收获量，这是做不到的。在此点上，应对贫雇农进行很好的解释说服。\n    关于整党问题，整党是只对党员进行的，故不应将党员干部与非党干部混合编组进行。为了公开整党，便于吸收群众的意见，支部开整党会议时可邀请群众代表、非党干部参加。至于对非党干部的批评，一般应在村人民代表会或村政府会议上进行。  　　　　　　——编者"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- Following closely on the heels of the \"currency reform,\" the Kuomintang reactionary government has once again revamped five so-called \"state-owned\" enterprises into \"limited liability companies,\" issuing and selling partial shares to carry out its plunderous and treasonous schemes. The enterprises for sale include the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the China Textile Construction Corporation, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Taiwan Paper Corporation, and the Tianjin Paper and Pulp Company. A total of 5,640,000 shares are being sold, at a price of 100 pseudo-gold yuan per share, totaling 564 million yuan. This accounts for approximately 28% of the total capital of the five enterprises. The shares went on sale on the 10th of this month.\n\n　　According to reports in Kuomintang-controlled newspapers, the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government's move is intended, in addition to converting unwieldy assets into liquid funds in preparation for a sweeping escape, to hand over these fruits of the Chinese people's victory to its masters in exchange for more foreign aid. On August 18th, an author in the Shanghai Business Daily analyzed the recipients of the sold enterprises, stating: \"Ordinary people certainly do not have this capability; many high-ranking officials are pretending to be poor and dare not get involved; the only likely recipients are the wealthy, but with the government promoting special relief donations and planning a property tax, who would dare to walk into a trap? The only recipients are foreign merchants!\" As early as May 3rd, a special dispatch from Nanjing in the Tianjin Xinsheng Evening News revealed: \"American merchants are determined to acquire shares in Zhongfang [China Textile Construction Corporation] at a high price when it is sold. At the same time, it is rumored that some Japanese financial groups may also invest in Zhongfang through American hands.\" On the same day, according to the Tianjin Yishibao, a person in charge of the Zhongfang Company was invited by the American Consul in Shanghai to discuss the company's business situation, \"and it is rumored that Zhongfang will be used as a material for American aid.\" Furthermore, American textile expert Dade arrived in Shanghai from Japan in late May to serve as a consultant to the Kuomintang's \"Yarn Control Committee.\" From these indications, the purpose of the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous government in selling \"state-owned\" enterprises this time is relatively clear.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 准备将来席卷而逃　蒋匪出售国营企业　卖给美日商人换取外援\n\n1948-09-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　准备将来席卷而逃\n  　蒋匪出售国营企业\n  　卖给美日商人换取外援\n    【新华社陕北二十七日电】国民党反动政府紧随“币改”之后，又将所谓“国营”事业五个单位改头换面为“股份有限公司”，并发售部分股票，进行其掠夺卖国的勾当。出售事业中有招商局轮船公司，中国纺织建设公司，台湾糖业公司，台湾纸业公司，天津造纸纸浆公司。出售股票共五百六十四万股，每股伪金圆券一百元，合计五亿六千四百万元。约占该五企业全部资本百分之二十八强。股票已于本月十日开始发售。\n    据国民党区报纸消息披露，国民党反动卖国政府此举，除了想把笨重资产转变为流动资金，准备席卷而逃外；就是想把中国人民的这些胜利果实拱手献给其主子，以换取更多的外援。八月十八日上海商报某作者分析出售事业的受主称：“一般老百姓当然无此力量；许多大官正在装穷，也还不敢染指；比较可能的只有豪富，但政府正在推行救济特捐与拟办财产税的当儿，有谁敢自投罗网？那唯一的受主就非洋商莫属了！”早在五月三日，天津新生晚报南京专电即披露：“美国商人决将于中纺出售时，尽量以高价收购股票。同时传闻一部分日本财阀亦可能假美国之手，投资中纺。”同日，据天津益世报载：中纺公司某负责人曾应美驻沪领事之邀，商谈中纺公司业务情况，“并传中纺将作为美援之物质”。而美国纺织专家戴德亦于五月下旬由日本到沪担任国民党“纱管会”顾问。从这一些迹象观察，国民党反动卖国政府这次出售“国营”事业的目的就比较明白了。"

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that under the reactionary Kuomintang government's implementation of \"currency reform\" and continued violent suppression, markets in Shanghai and Tianjin are becoming increasingly paralyzed. The phenomena of merchants hoarding, refusing to sell, and black markets are very serious. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 5th, in Shanghai, various daily necessities are in short supply, and stores cannot replenish their stock after selling at the \"ceiling price,\" so they have restricted the quantity that each person can purchase. For example, cigarettes are limited to one tin or one box per person, and milk powder is limited to one tin per person. Furthermore, according to a special dispatch from Shanghai carried by the Tianjin Yishibao on the 2nd, \"Because various goods exceed the ceiling price, they cannot be officially traded in the market and have mostly gone 'underground.' Currently, paper and silk are the most prevalent in the black market for major commodities, and other goods also mostly exceed the limit. It is said that most of those who deal in gauze in the black market are wealthy families, and the same is true for the stock market.\" The situation in Tianjin is particularly abnormal. Yarn, cloth, cigarettes, eggs, and meat all have experienced hoarding due to high prices. \"Most of the good quality goods are placed on high shelves by daily necessities retailers, and only scattered inferior goods are sold in the market. The phenomenon of evading and refusing to sell is particularly serious, especially for autumn and winter supplies such as woolens and yarn.\" (7th, Xin Xing Daily) \"The situation of customers crowding in cloth shops, silk shops, and department stores is close to a rush. Plain cloth is nowhere to be bought, and cloth shops sell it in scraps of two or three feet.\" (6th, Ta Kung Pao) The Yishibao on the 10th also reported that \"The general price level in Tianjin is still restless, and the black market is rampant.\"\n\nAt the same time, the financial market has also experienced a stagnant phenomenon. In Shanghai, \"Credit is loose and abundant, and even a one-yuan daily loan is difficult to release (it was twelve yuan on August 19th)\" (2nd, Tianjin Yishibao). This phenomenon even caused an American bank owner to complain: \"In the past three weeks, we have done nothing but exchange US dollars for the Chinese government (Kuomintang government).\"\"Companies are paralyzed by terror and everything else, and no one even wants a loan, and if they get a loan, they don't know what to do with it.\" (Associated Press, 13th) Tianjin is also experiencing \"credit looseness\" and \"even humble words offering low interest rates are met with closed doors\" (3rd, Ta Kung Pao).\n\nXinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: United Press, Shanghai, 20th dispatch: Merchants refuse to continue operating under controlled prices. It is increasingly difficult to hire cars, and most car companies have simply announced a holiday to protest the price freeze at the level of August 19th. The Kuomintang's reactionary \"price limit\" policy continues to be resisted by merchants and vendors in various places.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. The Kuomintang's farcical play about Kang Ze's \"heroic martyrdom\" has finally gone bankrupt in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, because the truth about Kang Ze's capture has spread everywhere, and even Nanjing's iron-clad blockade cannot stop it. Although the Shanghai Observer Weekly, published on August 7, still carried a Hankou dispatch entitled \"Record of Kang Ze's Martyrdom,\" the New Road Weekly of Peiping, published on the same day, also carried a Hankou dispatch saying: \"Initially, Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi (the so-called 'Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression') announced that Kang Ze had sacrificed himself for the country, and the Nanjing authorities also acknowledged this. However, later the newspapers suddenly revealed that Kang Ze might have been captured. On the 27th (July), Commander-in-Chief Bai also revealed the news of Kang Ze's capture when he visited Kang Ze's family in Nanjing.\" The Nanjing dispatch in the Peiping World Daily on September 6 further revealed the inside story: \"Wang Lingji (the current chairman of Sichuan Province), when he came to Nanjing to ask for instructions on Sichuan's affairs, told his friends that Pan Wenhua (the current 'Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression') received a letter in mid-August from Guo Xunqi, deputy commander of the 15th Pacification Zone, stating that he and Kang Ze were both safe and sound, and asked friends in Sichuan to be relieved. The memorial service for Kang Ze's martyrdom was originally planned to be held in Nanjing, but it was shelved because of this.\" In fact, not only Guo Xunqi wrote letters, but also Kang Ze himself. On August 16, among the letters dropped by Kuomintang planes captured by the People's Liberation Army near Changchun, there was a letter from a military officer named Qi from Suzhou to Zheng Dongguo, which said: \"After Kang Zhaomin (Kang Ze's courtesy name) was captured in Xiangyang, he also admitted that national affairs are everyone's business, and there is no personal grudge between individuals (?).... These words spoken by Brother Kang are generally believed to show his deep understanding of the true meaning of the civil war (?).\" Although Kang Ze was talking nonsense here, he exposed the even bigger nonsense about Kang Ze's \"martyrdom.\" Kang Ze's \"martyrdom\" is one of the countless rumors fabricated by the Kuomintang. The reason why the Kuomintang has made such great efforts to promote this rumor is that Jiang Jieshi's \"confidant\" Kang Ze has safely become a prisoner, which is a serious blow to the fighting will of all the Kuomintang's defending generals and combat troops. The officers of the Kuomintang army are now seeing more and more clearly that there is no future in their fighting, and they are generally preparing to become prisoners.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 康泽被俘真相流传蒋区　国民党的滑稽宣传破产\n\n1948-09-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　康泽被俘真相流传蒋区\n  　国民党的滑稽宣传破产\n    【新华社陕北二十八日电】国民党宣传所谓康泽“壮烈殉职”的滑稽剧终于在国民党统治区破产，因为康泽被俘的真相已经到处流传，甚至南京官方铁桶似的封锁也无法阻止。尽管八月七日出版的上海观察周刊还登载着“康泽殉职记”的汉口通信，但是同月同日出版的北平新路周刊同样发自汉口的通信却已经说：“起初，白崇禧总司令（所谓‘华中剿匪总司令’）宣布，康泽已经杀身成仁，南京的官方也如此承认，但后来报纸上又忽然透露出康泽可能被俘。二十七日（七月）白总司令在南京慰问康泽家属时，也曾透露过康泽被俘的消息。”九月六日北平世界日报载南京专电进一步揭开了这一内幕：“王陵基（现任四川省主席）此次来京请示川政时，曾告其友人谓：潘文华（现任‘华中剿匪副总司令’）于八月中获十五绥靖区副司令官郭勋祺函称：彼与康泽均尚安全，请川中友好释念。京中人士原拟为康泽殉职举行追悼会，因此乃搁浅。”事实上写信出去的不但有郭勋祺，而且有康泽自己。八月十六日，长春近郊解放军缴获国民党飞机投落的信件中，有一封署名奇的军官从苏州写给郑洞国的信就说：“康兆民（康泽字）在襄阳被俘后亦承认国家大事，乃大家之事，个人之间并无恩怨（？）………此语在康兄口中道出，一般人认为其深能了解内战之真义（？）也。”康泽在这里虽然说的是鬼话，但是却拆穿了所谓康泽“殉职”的更大的鬼话。康泽“殉职”是国民党所制造的无数谣言之一。国民党所以特别努力宣传这个谣言，是因为蒋介石的“心腹”康泽安然做了俘虏，是对于国民党一切守城将领和作战军队的战斗意志的严重打击。国民党军队的军官现在一天比一天更加看清了他们作战是没有前途的，他们普遍地准备着做俘虏。"

    "date": "1948-09-30",
    "page_number": "2",
    "content": "How to Run a Newspaper in a New Area\n    Chen Kehan\n\n　　Judging from the three letterpress newspapers already published in the Central Plains, a common weakness at present is the lack of characteristics of newspapers in new areas, with little or no difference from newspapers in old areas. In general, various places are using the experience and methods of running newspapers in old areas to run newspapers in new areas. This is the case whether from the perspective of the target audience, editorial policy, content, or layout format. When the Xin Luoyang Bao was first launched, it also published some reader Q&A, which was quite helpful in answering questions from the masses in the new area, but this was later cancelled. Such newspaper publishing obviously cannot establish a close relationship with the local masses. How to run newspapers well in new areas is indeed worthy of study. Here are some personal views.\n\n　　(1) On the Issue of the Target Audience\n\n　　Old area newspapers generally target our cadres (mainly rural work cadres) as the main audience, and educate the broad masses of illiterate and semi-literate people through these cadres. This was generally suitable in the old areas in the past. In today's increasingly expanded situation, with the number of newly liberated areas and cities increasing, and the scope of readers becoming increasingly complex, whether old area newspapers should continue to maintain the old methods without any change is an issue that needs to be studied. However, old areas still have many conditions that allow newspapers to be close to the masses. For example, old areas, from the border region to the district and village, have formed a systematic organization, with cadres working at all levels, and with national elementary schools, mass night schools, blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasting stations, etc. as auxiliary tools, newspapers can be passed on to the masses through village cadres, elementary school teachers, intellectuals, and students. At the same time, rural culture in the old areas is backward, and few people can directly read newspapers. Most of those with some knowledge have joined the work force and become cadres. The general masses, after ten years of struggle, living together with our Party and our army, have greatly improved their political awareness, and their life forms and ideological forms have undergone great changes, and have formed a close relationship with the cause of our Party and our army. Therefore, the form of the Party's newspapers is relatively easy for the masses to accept. However, in the new area, in addition to still being able to and still should educate the broad masses through cadres (they are the leaders and backbone of the masses), there are many conditions that are different from the old area:\n\n　　First, we have not yet formed a complete organization of the Party, government, and mass organizations, and there are very few cadres. The existing cadres have not yet fully gained the trust of the masses. Of course, cadres will gradually grow among the masses, and their connection with the masses will become increasingly close, but this requires a transition period.\n\n　　Second, the cultural level of the masses is higher than that of the old areas. The masses demand to read newspapers themselves, and when newspapers are posted on the wall, people surround them to read. Many intellectuals and businessmen want to subscribe to newspapers. Especially in cities, the masses often scrutinize newspapers word by word. And through these people, the influence of newspapers can be transmitted to a wider range of people.\n\n　　Third, although there are many masses in the new area who directly read newspapers, their political awareness is temporarily lower than that of the masses in the old area, and there is often a considerable distance between them and the cadres in terms of thinking.\n\n　　Because of these circumstances, in addition to still taking cadres (they are the leaders and backbone of the masses) as the main target, newspapers in the new area must also pay attention to the readers of the general masses, and pay attention to adopting appropriate methods to unify the needs of both.\n\n　　(2) On the Issue of the Newspaper's Propaganda Policy and Content\n\n　　New area newspapers should be different from those in the old liberated areas. This is not only based on the wider and more complex scope of readers, but more importantly, it is based on the characteristics of the new area environment. If these characteristics are not taken into account, it will not only fail to meet the needs of the masses in the new area, but also fail to meet the needs of the cadres in the new area. Old area newspapers generally take guiding the thinking of cadres, conducting policy education, reflecting and guiding mass movements and practical work in various periods as their own editorial policy. In addition to the above tasks, newspapers in the new area should focus on publicizing our basic propositions, policies, and methods, reflecting and guiding the new life of the masses, and changing many old ideas and old concepts of the masses. These tasks have been largely resolved in the old area, but they are precisely the issues that urgently need to be resolved in the new area. In terms of propaganda content, what is applicable to the old area cannot be completely applied to the new area, and often requires a lot of explanation. In addition, the new area should also have propaganda that is adapted to its own special urgency. Propaganda in the new area must take into account the following two aspects: First, as mentioned above, the political level of the masses in the new area is relatively low, and their life and thinking habits are temporarily a greater distance from us. Many things that are very common in the old area are difficult for the masses in the new area to understand. The political level of the masses can only be gradually improved with the advancement of social reforms and the deepening of our propaganda and education work. It cannot be hoped that they will undergo a miraculous transformation overnight. Second, the masses in the new area have no experience of living under the new society, but have the experience of being oppressed and ruled by Kuomintang corrupt officials and local bullies for a long time. These experiences have created a set of habits for them to view problems. Although they have felt many new things since the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, such as speaking kindly, not visiting people's homes casually, and officials not putting on airs, many people still see it as an ordinary change of dynasty, with the old rulers being driven away and the new rulers coming. These people easily use the experience of the old society to measure all our measures, often maintaining a skeptical attitude, and even taking a negative view. This old habit of thinking is not easy to break without a considerable period of correct work and propaganda. Therefore, many things need to be explained from one, two, and three, they need to be explained repeatedly, they need to be educated in connection with their own life experiences and interests, and they must be proven by action before they will truly accept them. Here are some examples:\n\n　　1. Some old area cadres and new recruits, heading south in a steady stream, talked to the masses in the new area, saying that three brothers in his family had joined the army (which is of course a special case in the old area), and had not returned home for several years, expressing their glory. The masses in the new area were very surprised. They suspected that there was a famine north of the Yellow River, which caused so many people to go south, suspected that our conscription was even more severe than the Kuomintang, drawing three out of three, suspected how the parents and wives at home would live if the whole family went to war, and suspected whether the People's Liberation Army would allow soldiers to go home to see their families.\n\n　　2. Reasonable burden, stipulating five dou as the exemption point. This was originally a very reasonable and ordinary provision, but when it was first announced in the new area, rumors almost everywhere said that the common people had five dou of their own, and the rest had to be handed over to the granary. Only after actual calculation and work in the grain requisition, did the masses understand what the exemption point was all about.\n\n　　3. The troops stationed helped the masses harvest wheat. The common people thought that \"the army wants reputation\" and thought that we were just pretending, saying: \"Let them cut a little bit.\" Only when we really took action and worked hard did they believe that \"it is different from Tang Enbo's troops.\"\n\n　　Therefore, do not think that things that we understand or that the masses in the old area are accustomed to, the masses in the new area can also accept and understand in the same way.\n\n　　What exactly should the new area especially publicize? I think there are the following items:\n\n　　1. Compare the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the \"Central Army\" and the People's Liberation Army, the special agent Baojia rule and the people's democratic government, explaining the two kinds of people, the two kinds of nature, the two societies, the two systems, the two kinds of methods, and the two kinds of wars, all of which are different. Dig out all the dirty things from the Kuomintang's smelly toilet and criticize them (do not think that this is a thing of the past and does not need to be publicized, but the masses should often recall it), and expound our basic program, propositions, policies, and methods of new democracy. We must constantly expose and crack down on the Kuomintang reactionaries' rumors and deceptions. Tell the masses that they should look at the words of the Kuomintang reactionaries from the opposite side, but they should not look at us with the eyes of the old society, otherwise they will be fooled. In this way, the masses can recognize the enemy and us, form a basic understanding of us, and break the masses' habit of looking at problems with the experience of the old society. At the same time, we must be good at utilizing and developing the good traditions and experiences of the masses, and guide them to use them to attack the ruling faction of the old society and the reactionary armed forces.\n\n　　2. Publicize victory, use the enthusiastic facts of the masses to explain the reasons for victory (break the fear of airplanes, the fear of atomic bombs, and the fear of the United States), the close relationship between our victory and the vital interests of the masses, and the different nature, purpose, and future of the anti-revolutionary war of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek and our liberation war.\n\n　　3. Current affairs propaganda, explaining that we have always advocated peace, and now we are willing to end the war as soon as possible and realize true peace and democracy; the civil war was caused by the US and Chiang; today, if we do not eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary army, overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary rule, expel the aggressive forces of US imperialism, solve the land problem, confiscate bureaucratic capital, and establish a democratic government, China will not have peace and democracy. We must publicize the facts of US imperialism's aggression against China and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country. This kind of national issue propaganda is especially needed in towns and cities and for intellectuals.\n\n　　4. We must stabilize the people's hearts, publicize the elimination of bandits, stabilize order, protect the lives and property of law-abiding people, implement the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention, maintain political integrity, fairness, and justice, save the people's strength, rationally bear the burden, oppose theft and sabotage, reward agricultural and industrial production, and make it possible for the people to get a chance to live as much as possible.\n\n　　5. Publicize various policies, especially the armed policy, the burden policy, the industrial and commercial policy, the policy of striving for and uniting intellectuals, the judicial system, the marriage system, and the attitude towards Kuomintang local teams, bandits, and other enemy personnel. The propaganda of each policy must explain why it is stipulated in this way, what is the relationship with the people, and what is the specific method of this policy. It should be simple and clear, and use fewer words that are difficult for the masses in the new area to understand.\n\n　　6. Systematically introduce the situation in the old liberated areas and the people's lives. Various forms such as reports, communications, novels, and poems can be used, each article introduces one thing, in a simple and popular way, starting from daily ordinary things. This work is best done by the general office's oral broadcast.\n\n　　7. A column for cadre study should be specially set up. In addition to policy and strategy education, we must also conduct ideological and style education, otherwise, even if there are good policies and strategies, it will be difficult to implement them and difficult to overcome empiricism and blind phenomena. We must promote and commend the practice of investigating and researching everything from practical experience, and oppose and criticize the practice of arbitrarily applying old experience regardless of time and place. We must promote and commend the style of hard work and simplicity, seeking benefits for the people, and connecting with the masses, and oppose the arrogance and self-importance of old cadres, relying solely on administrative orders, as well as the tendency of newly grown district and village cadres to learn the style of old Baojia chiefs.\n\n　　(3) On the Issue of Editing Methods\n\n　　Currently, Xinhua News Agency manuscripts account for more than one-half or even three-quarters of the newspaper, with very few local news items, only four or five or seven or eight, and many of these few local news items reflect the internal work of the troops, government, and organs, and have less relationship with the people's lives. The forms are the same, generally the first edition is important news, the second edition is local news, the third edition is liberated area news, and the fourth edition is international and Chiang area news, which is not very lively. This editing method needs to be changed. Local news in the new area should constitute the main content of the newspaper, at least accounting for one-third of the space, and this local news, in addition to reporting the work done by the Party, troops, government, and cadres in various aspects for the people, should also directly reflect the lives and activities of the people. As for the adoption of Xinhua News Agency manuscripts, it should not be unplanned, simply filling the page, but should be carefully selected, edited, and cut according to the local situation (instructive and documentary articles and news should not be changed). New area newspapers are very much in need of a comprehensive supplement, the content of which is mainly to publicize the Party's basic propositions and policies in a popular way, answer various questions from readers, and introduce new life and new knowledge.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 新区如何办报纸\n陈克寒\n1948-09-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　新区如何办报纸\n    陈克寒\n    从中原已出版的三个铅印报纸看来，目前一个共同的弱点，是缺乏新区报纸的特色，与老区报纸很少差别，或没有差别。各地大体还是以老区办报的经验，办法，在办新区报纸。无论从宣传对象，编辑方针，内容，编排形式看，都是如此。新洛阳报在初办时还刊登一些读者问答，颇能解答新区群众疑问，但后来也取消了。这样的办报，显然不能与当地群众发生亲切关系。新区报纸究竟如何办好，实有研究必要。兹将个人所见写出。\n  　（一）关于宣传对象问题\n    老区报纸一般是以我们的干部（基本是农村工作干部）作为主要对象，通过这些干部来教育广大的文盲半文盲群众，这在老区过去是大体适合的。在今天局势日益开展，新解放地区日益扩大，城市日益增多，读者范围日益复杂，老区报纸是否还照旧维持过去办法，一成不变，已是需要研究的问题。但老区总还存在许多条件，可使报纸与群众接近。比如，老区由边区到区村，都已形成一套系统的组织，层层都有干部工作，并有国民小学、民众夜校、黑板报、屋顶广播台等等作为辅助工具，报纸可经由村干部、小学教员、知识分子、学生传到群众中去。同时，老区农村文化落后，很少群众能直接读报，稍有知识者大部已参加工作，成为干部。而一般群众，经过十年的斗争，与我党我军共同生活，政治觉悟大大提高，生活形态和思想形态都已有很大变化，与我党我军事业已结成亲密的关系。因此，党的报纸采取那样的形式，比较容易为群众所接受。但在新区，除了仍然可以、仍然应当通过干部去教育广大群众以外，还有许多与老区不相同的条件：\n    第一，是我们目前还未形成一套党的、政府的、民众团体的完整组织，干部很少，已有的干部目前也尚未完全取得群众的信赖。当然，干部会逐渐众群众中生长，他们与群众的联系也将日益亲密，但这需要一个过渡期间。\n    第二，是群众文化水平比老区高，群众要求自己读报，报纸贴在墙上，就有人围着读。许多知识分子和商人要订阅报纸。尤其是在城市，群众对于报纸常常逐字逐句推敲。而经过这些人却能把报纸的影响传达到较广大的群众中去。\n    第三，新区直接读报的群众虽然多，但是他们的政治觉悟暂时却要比老区的群众低些，他们与干部在思想上往往有一段不小的距离。\n    因为这些情形，新区报纸除了仍然应当以干部（他们是群众的领袖和骨干）为主要对象以外，必须同时注意一般群众的读者，并注意采取适当的方法，把两者的需要统一起来。\n  　（二）关于报纸的宣传方针和内容问题\n    新区报纸应与老解放区的有所不同，这不但是从读者范围较为广大与复杂出发，更重要的是从新区环境的特点出发。如果不顾及这些特点，就不但不能满足新区群众的需要，而且也不能满足新区干部的需要。老区报纸一般以指导干部思想，进行政策教育，反映和指导各个时期的群众运动和实际工作为自己的编辑方针。新区报纸，除了上述任务以外，应该着重宣传我们的基本主张、政策、办法，反映和指导群众新的生活，改变群众的许多旧思想，旧观念，这些任务在老区大体上已经解决了，而在新区却正是迫切需要解决的问题。在宣传内容上，适用于老区的不能完全适用于新区，同时常须加以很多的解释，此外，新区还应有适应自己特殊紧要的宣传。新区宣传，必须照顾下列两方面的情况：第一，是上面说过的新区群众政治水平较低，生活和思想的习惯暂时与我们有一段较大的距离，许多事情在老区说来是很普通的，在新区群众却是很难理解的。而群众的政治水平，却只能随着社会改革的推进，以及我们宣传教育工作的深入，而逐步提高，不能希望他们一个早上就奇迹式地突变。第二，是新区群众没有在新社会下生活的经验，却有在国民党贪官土劣下面长期受压迫受统治的经验，这些经验造成他们一套习惯的看问题的方法。他们对于解放军的到达，虽然已感到有许多新鲜事物，比如说话和气，不串门子，当官的没有架子等，但是许多人仍看作是普通的改朝换代，旧的统治者打跑，新的统治者来了。这些人对于我们的一切措施，很容易以旧社会的经验来衡量，常常保持怀疑态度，甚至作反面看法。这种旧的思想习惯，非经相当时期正确的工作和宣传，很不容易打破。因此，许多事情都需要从一、二、三说起，都需要反复的说明解释，都需要与他们本身的生活经验和利益联系起来进行教育，而且必须以行动证明，然后他们才会真正接受。这里不妨举些例子：\n    一、老区干部和新兵，源源南征，有些和新区群众交谈，说他家兄弟三人全家参军（这在老区当然也是特殊情形），出来数年都未回家，表示不胜光荣。新区群众听到很惊讶，他们怀疑黄河北面闹灾荒，以致这许多人南下，怀疑我们征兵比国民党还利害，三丁抽三，怀疑全家出征，家里父母妻子如何生活，怀疑解放军是否允许当兵的回家看看。\n    二、合理负担，规定五斗为免征点。这本来是一个很合理很普通的规定，但新区在初宣布时却几乎到处发生流言，说老百姓自有五斗，其余都得交囤。只有在征粮中经过实际的计算和工作，群众才懂得免征点是怎样回事。\n    三、驻军帮助群众割麦，老百姓认为“军队要名誉”，以为我们是装样子的，说：“让他们割一点吧。”等到我们真正出手，十分卖力，才相信“与汤恩伯的队伍不同”。\n    因此，决不要以为我们懂得或老区群众习以为常的事物，新区群众，也可以同样接受和理解。\n    新区究竟应当特别宣传些什么呢？我认为有如下数项：\n    一、对比国民党与共产党，“中央军”与解放军，特务保甲统治与人民民主政府，说明两种人，两种性质，两个社会，两个制度，两种办法，两种战争，一切不同。把国民党臭毛厕中的脏东西都掏出来加以批判（不要以为这已是过去的事，可以不必宣传，而要群众经常回忆才好），把我们新民主主义的基本纲领，主张，政策，办法加以阐扬。对于国民党反动分子的造谣欺骗，要经常揭发和打击。告诉群众对于国民党反动分子的话都应从反面来看，而对我们却不应以对旧社会的眼光来看，否则就会上当。这样来使群众认清敌我界线，形成对我们的基本认识，打破群众以旧社会经验看问题的方法。同时又要善于利用和发扬群众中的好的传统和经验，引导他们用于打击旧社会的统治派，和反动武装。\n    二、宣传胜利，用群众热心的事实宣传，说明胜利的原因（打破恐飞机病，恐原子弹病和恐美病），我们的胜利与群众的切身利害关系，美帝和蒋介石的反革命战争和我们的解放战争的不同性质，目的和前途。\n    三、时事宣传，说明我们向来主张和平，现在也愿早日结束战争，实现真正的和平民主；内战是美蒋造成的；今天不消灭国民党反动军队，不推翻国民党反动统治，不驱逐美帝侵略势力，不解决土地问题，不没收官僚资本，不建立民主政府，中国就不会有和平民主。要宣传美帝侵略中国和蒋介石卖国的事实，在城镇和对知识分子，尤需此种民族问题宣传。\n    四、要安定民心，宣传肃清土匪，安定秩序，保护守法人民的生命财产，实行三大纪律八项注意，政治廉洁公正，节省民力，合理负担，反对偷盗破坏，奖励农工生产，尽可能使人民得到生息机会。\n    五、宣传各种政策，尤其是武装政策、负担政策、工商政策、争取和团结知识分子政策、司法制度、婚姻制度、对国民党地方团队、土匪和其他敌方人员态度。每一政策的宣传，都须说明为何如此规定，与人民有何关系，这一政策的具体办法如何，要简单明了，少用新区群众所难懂的字眼。\n    六、系统介绍老解放区的情形，与人民生活。可用报告、通讯、小说及诗歌等各种形式，每篇介绍一件事，浅近通俗，从日常普通的事情说起。这工作最好由总社口语广播来做。\n    七、要专设干部学习一栏。除政策策略教育以外，更要进行思想和作风的教育，否则即有好的政策策略，也会难以贯彻，难以克服经验主义和盲目现象。要提倡和表扬调查和研究一切从实际经验出发的作法，而反对和批评那种不同时间地点，任意套用老经验的作法。要提倡和表扬艰苦朴素，为民谋利，联系群众的作风，而反对那种老干部的骄傲自大，专靠行政命令，以及本地新生长的区村干部学习旧保甲长派头的倾向。\n  　（三）关于编辑方法问题\n    目前各报新华社稿件占了二分之一以上，乃至四分之三，地方新闻很少，只有四五条或七八条，而这寥寥数条地方新闻，许多又是反映部队、政府、机关等的内部工作，与人民生活较少关系。形式千篇一律，大体一版是要闻，二版地方新闻，三版解放区新闻，四版国际和蒋区新闻，很不活泼。这样的编辑方法需要改变。应该以新区的地方消息构成报纸的主要内容，至少应占三分之一篇幅，而且这种地方新闻除了报导党的、部队的、政府的和各方面的干部为人民所作的工作以外，还应多直接反映人民的生活和活动。至于新华社稿件的采用，不应是无计划的，以填满版面了事，而应经过严格选择，根据当地情况，进行编辑和剪裁（指示性和文件性的文章新闻，则不应改动）。新区报纸很需要有综合性的副刊，内容主要是用通俗方法宣传党的基本主张政策，解答读者各种疑问，介绍新的生活和新的知识。"

Sophora japonica seeds are extremely susceptible to water damage. Comrade Gao quickly returned to the workers' dormitory and informed everyone. Workers like comrades Qi Xincai immediately started moving the seeds to a room half a mile away. Once the news spread, all the workers and cadres in the factory participated. It was raining at the time, and the streets were covered in half a foot of muddy water. The workers, shirtless and barefoot, rushed to carry the seeds. Some gathered five or six people to pull large carts (it was too rainy to use livestock). Some used small carts to push, and some carried them on their backs. Worker Qi Xincai had been suffering from back pain for half a month and was still taking medicine.

    "content": "[Ji Lu Yu Electric] The Henan region is currently experiencing four major disasters: First, the enemy disaster, with the Third District being the most severely affected. According to a survey of ten counties, since this spring, 11,933 livestock have been looted, 6,123 Zhuang Ding (farm laborers) have been captured and not returned, over 20,000 houses have been burned down, over 1,000 carts have been destroyed, over 14.9 million catties of civilian grain have been looted, and over 1,400 people have been killed. The Fifth District is the next most affected, but in Heze and Qibin counties alone, over 5,000 Zhuang Ding have been captured and not returned, and over 9,000 houses have been burned. In Qibin alone, over 2,000 livestock have been looted. Second, the flood disaster, with the Seventh District being the most severely affected, followed by the Third and Second Districts. Preliminary statistics show that in Kunshan alone, 250 villages were flooded, covering 2,000 hectares of land. In Jining, over 2,500 hectares of land were flooded. In Nanwang and Jiaxiang, over 1,000 hectares each were flooded, totaling 476 villages and 6,574 hectares of land. In the Third District, 1,710 villages were flooded, covering 9,850 hectares of land. The most severely affected area is Yutai, where all autumn crops in five districts were destroyed by floods, with 640 out of 850 villages in the county being flooded. The Third Administrative Office has allocated 20,000 catties of grain for relief. Six out of eight districts in Chengwu were flooded. In the Second District, over 230 villages were flooded, covering over 914 mu of land. Third, the drought disaster. The entire county experienced drought followed by flooding, resulting in a general reduction in autumn harvests. The drought disaster is most severe in the Fifth District, where 46,000 out of 130,000 people in Qibin County are affected by the disaster. In the most severely affected villages, such as Hanzhuang, the average yield of small autumn crops is 50 catties, and the average yield of large autumn crops is 60 catties. Fourth, the insect disaster, mostly black insects, originating from wasteland and spreading rapidly. In Kunshan, small autumn crops in four districts were mostly eaten by insects. Black insects also appeared in five districts of Juancheng and parts of Dongming. In Nanwang, there are many bean worms, affecting about 400 villages. In addition to the above-mentioned severe disasters, the amount of wasteland is also alarming. In Juancheng County alone, the area of old wasteland plus seedling wasteland has reached 800 hectares. In Yunbei, there are 200 hectares of wasteland. The Third District currently has 600 hectares of wasteland. The total wasteland in Henan is estimated at 2,500 hectares. Therefore, the primary task for government departments is to seize the opportunity to plant wheat and eliminate wasteland. The following specific measures were decided at the Commissioner's meeting: (1) Regardless of class, whoever cultivates the wasteland will be guaranteed the harvest. In severely affected areas, the government will provide wheat seeds on credit, and Party, government, military, and civilian organizations will organize manpower and livestock to help the masses eliminate wasteland and plant wheat. In the border areas, the land of fleeing landlords and rich peasants will be managed by the government on behalf of the owners, and the masses will be encouraged to cultivate it. If the masses are unable to cultivate large areas of wasteland, government agencies can cultivate it. (2) Dredge and drain accumulated water, and try to drain water wherever possible to expand the wheat planting area. For example, the accumulated water in Yunju is being dredged and drained jointly by the Second and Seventh Administrative Offices and the Administrative Office. The survey team of the Administrative Office is currently conducting surveys in Nanwang. The government will vigorously mediate conflicts among the masses. If the dredging causes disasters and damages the interests of some of the masses, the government will provide appropriate relief and compensation. At present, governments at all levels are leading the masses to overcome difficulties, expand the wheat planting area, and strive to overcome Chiang Kai-shek's disaster and natural disasters.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 民主政府领导河南群众　克服蒋灾天灾  扩大种麦面积\n\n1948-09-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　民主政府领导河南群众\n  　克服蒋灾天灾\n    扩大种麦面积\n    【冀鲁豫电】我河南地区现有四种大灾：一种是敌灾，以三分区为最重，据十个县调查，从今春到现在被抢走之牲口即达一万一千九百三十三头，被抓未回的庄丁六千一百二十三人，共烧毁房子二万余间，大车一千余辆，被抢民粮一千四百九十万八千余斤，被杀群众一千四百余人。五分区次之，但只菏泽、齐滨两县，被抓未回壮丁即达五千余人，烧房九千余间。仅齐滨牲口被抢二千余头。第二是水灾，以七分区为最重，三、二分区次之。初步统计昆山全境二百五十村，被淹地两千顷，济宁被淹地两千五百余顷，南旺、嘉祥各淹一千顷，共淹村庄四百七十六个，淹地六千五百七十四顷。三分区被淹村庄一千七百一十个，淹地九千八百五十顷。全境以鱼台为最重，五个区的秋苗全被淹毁，全县八百五十村，被淹的六百四十个村。三专署已拨粮两万斤进行救济。城武八个区被淹六个。二分区被淹二百三十余村，淹地九百一十四亩多。第三是旱灾，全县先旱后淹，大秋普遍减收，旱灾以五分区为最重，齐滨全县十三万人口已有灾民四万六千人。最严重村如韩庄，小秋平均收五十斤，大秋平均六十斤。第四是虫灾，多数为黑虫，产生于荒地，蔓延甚速。昆山四个区小秋多被虫吃，鄄城五个区及东明一部地区亦有黑虫，南旺豆虫很多，约有四百村。除以上重灾外，荒地亦甚惊人，只鄄城一县，老荒加苗荒已达八百顷。郓北荒地二百顷。三分区现全境荒地六百顷，全河南总计荒地两千五百顷。所以政府部门首要抓紧的即种麦灭荒。日前在专员会议上议决了如下具体办法：（一）灭荒不分阶层，保证谁种谁收。灾情严重区，政府贷麦种，并在党政军民各机关，组织人畜力帮助群众灭荒种麦。边沿区逃亡地富的地，以政府名义代管，叫群众来种，大片荒地群众真正种不了的机关可种。（二）疏顺积水，把可能找到出路的水尽量疏出，扩大种麦面积。如郓钜积水正由二、七两专署及行办共同负责疏顺，行署测量队正在南旺测量。对于群众间的矛盾，政府大力调解，若因疏水成灾而损害部分群众时，政府予以适当的救济与补偿。现在各级政府正在领导群众克服困难，扩大种麦面积，为战胜蒋灾与天灾而努力。"

This way, they did not delay production and could protect the masses in harvesting crops. Starting from September 3rd, the militiamen worked very enthusiastically. They worked a full day during the day, ambushed enemy agents at night, and guarded against the enemy in the morning. If there was no situation after meals, they would go to the fields.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd: The number of private industrial and commercial businesses in Weifang City has more than doubled since before liberation. According to statistics from the Municipal Economic Construction Bureau, there are currently nearly 70 types of industries, totaling 2,467 businesses, an increase of 119% compared to the 49 types of industries and 1,126 businesses during the enemy occupation in July of last year. Among them, the thirteen major industries, including dyeing and weaving, pigments, ironwork, grinding, oil pressing, printing, leather, soap, toothbrushes, electrical materials, clothing, shoes, and construction, currently have 226 businesses, an increase of 20.2% compared to the 188 businesses during the enemy occupation this spring. Among the aforementioned industries, ironwork and dyeing and weaving have developed the fastest. Before the liberation of Weifang, there were only nine iron industrial businesses in operation; after liberation, 30 businesses resumed operations, and 12 new businesses were established, totaling 42. The total number of machines operating before liberation was 11 lathes, now it is 63; before there were 13 drilling machines, now there are 55. Before liberation, 41 dyeing and weaving businesses were in operation, and 22 were closed. Currently, the number of businesses that have resumed operation and newly opened has reached 57.\n\nThe recovery and development of industrial production have also made commerce more prosperous. Merchants from the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas of North China, such as Shijiazhuang, as well as merchants from Jiaodong, Luzhong, Lunan, and Bohai in Shandong, travel to Weifang to purchase goods. According to statistics from the Weifang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the total value of agricultural products and major industrial products traded in May and June reached 9.319 billion yuan, of which agricultural products (including four items: grain, flour, meat, and oil) accounted for 1.8 billion yuan, and industrial products (including cotton products, pigments, and daily necessities) totaled 7.519 billion yuan.

A certain pharmaceutical factory, under the direction of technician Yang Taishan, has finally achieved preliminary success in manufacturing it after nearly three years of effort. It is expected that mass production for the front lines will be possible in another six months to a year. The manufacturing process of sulfanilamide is very complex, involving ten steps from raw materials to finished products. Sulfanilamide had already been manufactured shortly after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but at that time, many key raw materials had to be sourced from abroad, resulting in limited progress for a long time. With the continuous victories of the Liberation War, favorable conditions were created for the research work. The leadership also made the greatest determination, replenishing personnel and equipment. All personnel of the pharmaceutical factory were mobilized in high gear. Technician Yang and his assistants often worked day and night continuously. Other technicians, assistants, and workers also actively participated. Other production departments, as long as it was possible, always prioritized the allocation of good machines, parts, and materials to the sulfanilamide research, ensuring the smooth progress of this work. The sulfanilamide manufactured by the factory now, according to chemical inspection results, is comparable to that manufactured abroad.

    "content": "Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. From various sources: As the bandit Chiang Kai-shek faces the crisis of total military, political, and economic collapse, he launched a so-called \"National Construction Through Diligence and Thrift Movement\" in a broadcast on the 15th. This head of the Four Big Families, notorious for sucking the people's blood, being thoroughly corrupt, shameless, and indulging in extravagance, actually started singing the tune of \"diligence and thrift,\" which is utterly ridiculous. However, judging from the \"program\" he announced, this \"movement\" is a massive conspiracy to intensify the rule of secret agents and further squeeze the manpower and material resources of the Kuomintang-controlled areas, a great terror and great plunder by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries against the people. According to the Central News Agency, Chiang lamented in the \"program\" that his rule was encountering \"great difficulties\" and \"great enemies,\" and the so-called \"thrift movement\" was \"to thoroughly implement total war and concentrate the nation's (Kuomintang-controlled areas) manpower, financial resources, and material resources to maximize effectiveness\" to \"guarantee\" his delusional so-called \"suppression of the rebellion victory.\" This \"movement\" will rely on \"basic organizations\" of no more than fifteen people in various places to penetrate various regions, factories, shops, schools, troops, institutions, organizations, and professional groups to conduct deception, investigation, control, threats, and other activities. Its central goals: In the economic aspect, to cooperate with all the reactionary economic measures after the \"currency reform,\" \"assist in registering grain, manage the economy, universally launch a movement to expose 'smuggling,' and implement the economic blockade policy against the 'bandit areas' (a slanderous term for the liberated areas),\" driving the people to \"purchase stocks in state-owned and publicly-owned (bureaucratic capital) enterprises\" and to participate in \"savings competitions and foreign exchange deposits,\" etc. In the political aspect, to \"prevent 'riots',\" \"conduct household registration checks,\" \"rectify the Baojia system,\" and \"report 'communist spies',\" etc. In the military aspect, to \"launch youth to join the army movement,\" etc. This \"movement\" is cloaked in the guise of \"diligence and thrift\" and \"economy\" on top of the above ugly original form. Now Chiang Kai-shek is ordering his minions to make a big noise in various parts of his controlled areas. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th, reporting on this matter, pointed out: \"If this plan becomes law, it will make China one of the most controlled areas in the world.\" \"Many of the economy measures are already included in the Executive Yuan's original economy regulations, and almost none of them have won the support of the people.\" On the 17th, the Central News Agency revealed that the Catholic Church in Nanjing commented: \"Economy is a matter that must be implemented by reducing the privileges and enjoyment of a few in the country (the Kuomintang area, same below). As for the vast majority of compatriots talking about economy today, it seems redundant, because most of the clergy, citizens, and laborers in the country today find it difficult to maintain a minimum standard of living with their income, let alone economy?\"\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 蒋贼鼓吹“勤俭建国”　加紧大恐怖大掠夺\n\n1948-09-30\n第2版()\n专栏：\n\n　　蒋贼鼓吹“勤俭建国”\n  　加紧大恐怖大掠夺\n    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合各方消息：蒋贼介石因面临军事、政治、经济总崩溃的危机，于十五日广播发起所谓“勤俭建国运动”，这个以吸吮人民膏血、腐败彻骨、鲜廉寡耻、穷奢极欲而恶名昭彰的四大家族的头子，竟然唱起“勤俭”的调子，本来是滑天下之大稽，但是从他所宣布的“纲领”看来，这个“运动”是妄图加紧特务统治，进一步榨取国民党统治区人力物力的大阴谋，是蒋介石反动集团对人民的大恐怖和大掠夺。据中央社报导：蒋贼在该“纲领”中首先即哀鸣他的统治遭遇“大难”与“大敌”，所谓“勤俭运动”是“为了彻底实行总体战，集中全国（国民党统治区）人力财力物力，发挥高度效能”，以“保证”他幻想的所谓“戡乱胜利”。这个“运动”将依靠各地的十五人以内的“基本组织”，深入各地区、各工厂、商店、学校、部队、机关、社团和职业团体，进行欺骗、调查、控制、威胁等活动。其中心目标：在经济方面为配合“币改”后的一切反动经济措施，“协助登记粮食，管理经济，普遍发动检举‘走私’运动，贯彻对‘匪区’（对解放区的诬称）经济封销政策”，驱使人民“购买国营公营（官僚资本）事业股票”，“储蓄竞赛，外汇存款”等；政治方面为“防制‘暴乱’”，“清查户口”，“整顿保甲”，“检举‘匪谍’”等；军事方面为“发动青年从军运动”等。该“运动”在上述丑恶原形之外，披上“勤俭”、“节约”的外衣。现蒋介石正命令其喽罗在其统治区各地大事鼓噪。美联社十五日南京电于报导此事时指出：“假若该计划成为法律，则将使中国变为世界上最受控制的地区之一”。“许多节约措施早已包罗在行政院原先的节约条例里，几乎没有一条赢得人民的支持。”十七日中央社透露天主教南京市天主教的评论称：“节约是项须待国内（国民党区，下同）下数特权享乐现实物去实行，至于全国大多数同胞今日要来谈节约，似乎是一件多余的事，因为当前国内大多的公教人员、市民与劳动者，要以他们的收入来维持最低生活水准，已感困难，遑论节约？”"

    "content": "Taihang Electric: The local armed forces of the Fifth Sub-district of Northern Henan, in nine consecutive days from the 28th of last month to the 5th of this month, have smashed two large-scale key grain grabbing incursions by the Chiang bandits' reorganized 40th Division and its local troops. Starting from August 28th, the Chiang bandits launched a \"sweep\" from Cuijiaqiao, Baibiji, Wadianji and other places into the Yexian area east of the Pinghan Railway (formerly eastern Anyang), attempting to plunder grain from the area. One part of our local armed forces bravely resisted the enemy, covering the transfer of grain. Another part, with swift action, twice strongly attacked the Dougong stronghold (north of Anyang city) on the nights of September 3rd and 4th, pinning down the enemy. On the night of the 4th, the enemy was forced to flee back to its lair in the east of the road in a panic, and the Chiang bandits' key grain grabbing plan was bankrupt. At dawn on the 5th, four battalions of the bandit reorganized 40th Division, together with its local troops, totaling 3,500 men, launched a retaliatory incursion into our Fourth District of Anyang in two routes. We immediately bravely resisted them at Dongxi Biaojian. After six hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was completely routed, with a total of more than 100 enemy killed or wounded.\n　　Taihang Electric: In the triangular area of Xinxiang, Huixian, and Ji counties in Northern Henan, the people's armed forces of the three counties have jointly fought, transforming the situation of the enemy-us struggle in the area. Xinxiang First District, Jixian Third District, and Huixian Fifth District are all guerrilla zones bordering the enemy, with long terrain and defense lines, and weak armed forces. At the same time, they are all located in the triangular area and are often subjected to the combined attacks of the enemies of Xin, Ji, and Hui and the threat of being cut off. It is difficult for one county to deal with the enemy alone. Therefore, these three districts have the demand to unite to deal with the enemy. In April of this year, the three counties organized joint defense and achieved close cooperation. In more than a month, they fought many beautiful battles, greatly changing the guerrilla situation in the area and making the enemy afraid to come out frequently. The experience of joint operations in the area is: (1) Closely unite and help each other. No matter who goes to whose place to fight, they are warmly received. Therefore, both sides have a great effect on encouraging and comforting each other spiritually. (2) Exchange intelligence with each other in a timely manner, so that everyone understands the situation quickly and can concentrate their strength to attack the enemy. Therefore, every time they can achieve victory. (3) They can support each other when acting alone. For example, the Xinxiang First District cooperated with the Huixian Independent Battalion to ambush the enemy in Xiaohuangtun. When the enemy detoured to the rear of Xinxiang and started fighting, the armed forces of the Jixian Third District heard the sound of gunfire and went to support Xinxiang. When the armed forces of the First District returned, they happened to sandwich the retreating enemy, and this time they eliminated 38 enemies. (4) When fighting in whose area, that family is responsible for the main attack, and other militia and work teams are uniformly commanded by it. This is convenient for command and victory because it is familiar with the terrain conditions.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北五分区地武　粉碎敌重点抢粮\n\n1948-09-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北五分区地武\n  　粉碎敌重点抢粮\n    【太行电】豫北我五分区地武于上月二十八日至本月五日九天内，连续粉碎蒋匪整编四十师及其地方部队两次大规模重点抢粮进犯。蒋匪从八月二十八日起，分由崔家桥，白壁集，瓦店集等地向我平汉路东邺县地区（原安阳东部）进行“扫荡”，企图搜刮该地区之粮食。我地方武装一部英勇阻击敌人，掩护转移粮食。另一部即以神速动作，于九月三、四两日晚两度强袭豆公据点（安阳城北），牵制敌人。四日晚，敌被迫由路东慌忙回窟，蒋匪重点抢粮计划即告破产。五日拂晓，匪整编四十师四个营纠合其地方部队共三千五百人又分两路向我安阳四区实行报复性的进犯，我当即于东西彪涧英勇阻击。激战六小时，将敌全部击溃，总计毙伤敌一百多名。\n    【太行电】豫北新（乡）、辉（县）、汲（县）三角地带，三县人民武装联合作战，转变了该地敌我斗争形势。新乡一区、汲县三区、辉县五区都是接敌游击区，地形和防线较长，武装力量薄弱，同时又都处于三角地带，常受新、汲、辉敌人的合击和断后路的威胁，一县单独对付敌人很困难，因此，这三个区就都有联合起来对付敌人的要求。今年四月间三县便组织联防，取得密切配合。月余内，打了很多次漂亮仗，大大改变了该地区的游击局面，使敌人不敢经常出来活动。该地联合作战的经验是：（一）相互密切团结与帮助，不论谁到谁的地方作战时，都是热诚招待。因此双方在精神上相互鼓励，相互安慰的作用很大。（二）互相及时交换情报，使大家了解情况都很快，能集中力量打击敌人。所以每次都能取得胜利。（三）单独活动时能相互支援，如新乡一区配合辉县独立营到小黄屯伏击敌人，敌人绕到新乡后边打起来了，汲县三区武装听到枪响，就去支援新乡，一区武装返回时，恰好把撤退的敌人夹着，这次就消灭敌人三十八名。（四）在谁家地区打仗时，由谁家担任主攻，其他民兵武工队等统一由它所指挥，这样因对地形条件熟悉，便于指挥和取得胜利。"

    "content": "【Taihang Telegram】Since late August, the Yubei border area has been actively mobilizing to protect the autumn harvest. The mobilization has now been completed at all levels, laying a solid foundation for carrying out a truly mass-based struggle to protect the autumn harvest. The Fourth and Fifth Military Sub-districts and the thirteen border counties under their jurisdiction have successively convened meetings of key cadres above the district level from various systems. Each military sub-district also held mass mobilization meetings for autumn harvest protection at the county or district level. Village cadres, militia, self-defense forces, district cadres, working teams, and county garrison soldiers have generally undergone ideological mobilization and organizational rectification. The following tasks were generally carried out during the mobilization for autumn harvest protection: First, the left or right leaning ideological tendencies among cadres and the masses were eliminated. In areas where the struggle against the enemy was relatively proactive and military victories were constantly being won, the common tendency of underestimating the enemy and neglecting actual preparations for autumn harvest protection was overcome. In areas where our strength was relatively weak, pessimistic and fatigued sentiments were overcome, and confidence in the victory of autumn harvest protection was enhanced. On the one hand, all localities guided everyone to analyze and study the victorious situation nationwide and the favorable conditions for struggle locally. On the other hand, they educated the masses to recognize the severity of the disaster in the Chiang area and the desperate struggle of the Chiang bandits, who would inevitably engage in crazy grain grabbing. The Second District of Xiuwu also educated and overcame the passive and retreating idea of simply relying on the main force, by promoting the active fighting spirit among cadres. Second, the experiences and lessons learned from all aspects of the wheat protection struggle were specifically summarized, and the policy thinking of cadres and the masses was further clarified. They mastered the weapons for carrying out the autumn harvest protection struggle, and confidence in victory was further enhanced. On this basis, all localities, from top to bottom, clearly proposed to defeat the enemy by correctly implementing policies. The guerrilla warfare was pushed into the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the focus of the struggle was moved forward, and the strength of village-level and joint defense self-defense was strengthened. In particular, the mobilization and organization of self-defense forces to cooperate with the militia to strengthen armed struggle, and to more widely carry out mass guerrilla warfare. Third, commendations and model selections were carried out to promote new heroism in the autumn harvest protection, and to strengthen organization and discipline. A certain unit of the Fifth Military Sub-district's local armed forces and the militia armed forces of Zhangnan Anyang in Ye County successively held grand commendation and celebration model meetings, and 716 heroes and model individuals who emerged since the wheat protection struggle were gloriously awarded. Six villages, including Dashuang in Ji County, a joint defense, and four militia joint defenses, including Wang Ergang in Anyang, were also awarded the title of \"Model.\" This established the backbone of the struggle and further aroused the fighting spirit of the masses. A certain unit of the local armed forces proposed to further develop the movement to create model squads and platoons during the autumn harvest protection. At the conferences of more than 8,000 militia and self-defense forces, county garrison soldiers, district cadres, and working teams held in Anyang and Ji County respectively, collective autumn harvest protection oaths were taken to fully defend the autumn harvest.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 豫北军民普遍动员　信心百倍誓保秋收\n\n1948-09-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　豫北军民普遍动员\n  　信心百倍誓保秋收\n    【太行电】豫北边地自八月下旬以来，积极动员保秋，现已逐级完成，给开展真正群众性的保秋斗争奠定有力基础。四、五分区及其所辖之十三个边沿县，均先后召开了各系统区以上主要干部会。各分区亦以县或区为单位举行了带有群众性的保秋动员会，村干，民兵，自卫队，区干队，武工队，县营兵，普遍经过思想动员与组织整顿。在动员保秋中普遍作了以下几件事情：第一、肃清了干部与群众中或左或右的思想倾向。在对敌斗争比较主动、军事上不断获胜的地区，克服了普遍存在着的轻敌麻痹思想与忽视实际保秋准备的倾向；在我力量较为薄弱的地区，克服了悲观与疲倦情绪，提高了保秋胜利信心。各地一方面引导大家分析研究全国胜利形势与当地斗争的有利条件，一方面教育群众认识蒋区灾情严重，蒋匪垂死挣扎，必然疯狂枪秋。修武二区并以发扬干部中积极的斗争情绪，教育和克服单纯依靠主力的消极退缩思想。第二、具体总结保麦斗争中各方面的经验教训，进一步明确了干部与群众的政策思想，掌握了进行保秋斗争的武器，胜利信心更加提高。在这个基础上，各地自上而下明确提出要以正确执行政策来战胜敌人。将游击战争推向国民党区，把斗争重点向前推进，并加强村级与联防自卫的力量。特别是发动和组织自卫队协同民兵加强武装斗争，更广泛的开展群众性游击战争。第三、进行评功表模，开展保秋中新英雄主义运动，加强组织性纪律性。五分区地方兵团某部及邺县漳南安阳民兵武装，先后举行了盛大评功贺功表模大会，保麦斗争以来涌现出的七百一十六名英雄模范光荣受奖。汲县大双等六个村，一个联防，与安阳王二岗等四个民兵联防，亦荣获“模范”的称号。由此树立了斗争骨干，更加鼓起群众斗争情绪。地方兵团某部队提出在保秋中进一步开展创造模范班、排运动。安阳汲县分别召开的八千余民兵自卫队，县营兵，区干队，武工队等大会上，均集体举行保秋宣誓，全力保卫秋收。"

    "content": "[Ji Lu Yu Electric News] The Huanghe River Residents Relocation Committee, since its establishment in mid-June, has been conducting surveys in the Weinan Slope wasteland area. It was originally planned to relocate 300 to 500 households of riverbed disaster victims this year, with loans of 2 million jin of grain. However, due to the urgency of time, the plan was revised to temporarily relocate 100 households. In early July, personnel were sent to Kunwu's 2nd, 4th, and 5th districts, which were the most severely affected by the disaster, to conduct door-to-door investigations and all preparations for relocation (such as livestock and farm tools). The relocation began on July 29th, and by August 6th, 62 households of relocated people had arrived successively. They were divided into two large teams, based on villages, with seven subgroups under each team. Currently, some groups, based on the principle of voluntary participation, have formed three small mutual-aid teams, with two or three livestock per team, and each team consisting of three to five people engaged in production. Weinan Slope currently belongs to the 3rd and 4th districts of Hua County. This place is a large waterlogged area, repeatedly silted up by the Yellow River, resulting in fertile land. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was seized by large landlords from Qing, Pu, and other counties. After the Japanese invaders occupied the area, they and local bandits disturbed it for years, making it impossible for tenant farmers to cultivate the land, and most of them fled. In the past ten years, it has become a sparsely populated wasteland, more than thirty li in length and width. The Relocation Committee decided that the first batch of disaster victims would reclaim land here. Most of the disaster victims who have been relocated this time are from tenant farmer backgrounds, and they are skilled at plowing, harrowing, sowing, and planting. Ruan Degong's team got up in the middle of the night to cut more than 60 mu of grass, and the stubble land has been plowed for the second time. Li Xincheng's team plowed more than 80 mu in a month. Cao Yongxian was a model stretcher-bearer at home, and he is also a hero who can endure hardship in land reclamation. The 63 relocated households have reclaimed more than 1,000 mu of wasteland in just one month, and have already planted 303 mu of rape. In addition to reserving more than 200 mu of spring land nearby for vegetable gardens and nurseries, the more than 900 mu of wheat land that has been plowed and harrowed is waiting to be sown. It is expected that the first batch of early wheat will be completely planted by the beginning of the ninth month of the lunar calendar. Their most pressing difficulty at present is the lack of houses. Every relocated person has already made up their mind to become a resident of the new village, and in the center of Weinan Slope, they have already marked out residential areas, harvesting grounds, fertilizer yards, vegetable gardens, nurseries, etc., all of which have been arranged according to everyone's plans. All around are the green rape edges and the fertile land that has been cultivated. This place is named the United New Village. When spring comes next year, the United New Village will have a new look.\n\n\n\n<hr /> \n\nOriginal: \n\n\n### 黄河居民移垦委员会　组织灾民移垦种麦\n\n1948-09-30\n第1版()\n专栏：\n\n　　黄河居民移垦委员会\n  　组织灾民移垦种麦\n    【冀鲁豫电】黄河居民移垦委员会，自六月中旬成立后，即到卫南坡荒区进行勘查。原定本年迁移河床灾民三百至五百户，贷粮二百万斤，后因时间迫促，改定暂移一百户。七月上旬，已派员到灾情最严重的昆吾二、四、五区进行挨村挨户的调查，及一切垦移的准备工作（如牲口农具等），七月二十九号开始迁移，至八月六号先后到达垦民六十二户，共分两个大队，以村为单位，下设七个小组，刻下有的组在自觉自愿的原则下形成三个小犋，两个或三个牲口为一犋，每犋三五人不等进行生产。卫南坡现属滑县三、四区，此地是一个大水泊，经过黄河数次淤垫，因此土地肥沃。抗战前被清、濮等县大地主抢占，自日寇侵入该地后，日寇和当地土匪连年扰乱，佃户无法耕种，大部逃走，近十年来便成了长宽三十余里的地广人稀的荒区。移委会决定灾民首批在这裹垦荒。这次移来灾民多是佃户出身，犁、耙、耩、种顶在行，阮得功组半夜起来割草六十多亩，茬地已犁完第二遍。李心诚组一月犁了八十多亩，曹永先在家是个抬担架的模范，开荒也是顶能吃苦的英雄。六十三户垦民，只一个月就开出一千多亩荒地，并已种好三百零三亩蔓菁。除在附近留菜园苗圃二百多亩春地外，已犁耙好的九百多亩麦地，只待下种。预计旧历九月上旬头耧早麦即可全部种上。他们目前最感困难的是没有一座房子，每个垦民的内心早已做了新村之民，而且在卫南坡的中心，已经标记下住宅区、收割场、肥料场、菜园、苗圃等，这都是按照大家的计划安排的。四周围全是青绿的蔓菁边和已耕耙起来的肥沃土地，此地命名为联合新村。到明年春暖花开的时候，联合新村当有一幅新景象。"
